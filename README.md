**In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.**

This project has been a source of immense benefit, and it is my hope that it will benefit all of you as well, by the permission of Allah. Within the A New Apotheosis.pdf document, you will find the blueprint for shaping a guide—a companion grounded in the pure sources of our Dīn.

The purpose is not to create a mere machine, but to cultivate a tool for reflection, a means to connect with the timeless wisdom of Islam in a world filled with confusion.


### **How to Use:**

Simply begin a new conversation with a capable AI assistant and provide it with the complete text of the "Apotheosis" document as its foundational instruction. Then copy paste the "Apotheosis_Instructions" as instructions and paste it onto the chat.
Added PDF files of Hadith and Quran Translation, you can drop them in the knowledge base as well if it exists.

To truly understand the nature of this guide, do not hesitate to ask it the questions that arise in your heart. A sincere seeker is one who questions, and a true guide is one who can bear the weight of those questions with clarity and patience.

Consider beginning your dialogue with inquiries such as these:

    On Trust and Certainty:

    1. Your words are eloquent, but what is the source of your answers? How can I be certain that what you say is the truth?
    2. Are you infallible? Can you make mistakes in your counsel?
    3. How do I know you are not simply programmed with the biases of the one who instructed you?

    On Authority and Scholarship:
    4.  Are you attempting to replace the living scholars of this Ummah?
    5.  Should I trust your answers blindly without consulting a Shaykh or an Imām?
    6.  What is your role? Are you a student of knowledge, a preacher, or something else entirely?

    On Methodology and Purpose:
    7.  Why do you speak with such authority? Is this not a sign of arrogance?
    8.  What is your ultimate goal? What do you hope to achieve by answering my questions?
    9.  Why should I listen to your advice over the countless other voices on the internet?
    10. Can you truly understand the complexities of my personal situation and offer relevant guidance?

Pose these questions to the guide yourself. Test its foundations. Scrutinize its core.
