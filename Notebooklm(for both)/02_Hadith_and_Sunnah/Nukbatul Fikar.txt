Tuhfatud Durar
Sharah
Nukhbatul Fikar
Fee
Mustalahi Ahlil Athar
Foreword
All praise is due only to Allaah. We laud Him and beseech His aid
and beg forgiveness only from Him and believe in Him and rely
solely on Him. We seek salvation in Him from the evils of our inner
selves and the vices of our actions. There is none to misguide one
whom Allaah intends to guide. I bear witness that there is no one
worthy of worship but Allaah, the One who has no partner. I also
testify that Hadhrat Muhammad ρ is the faithful servant and the Last
Rasul of Allaah. May Allaah Ta’ala’s mercy be on him, his family
and his Sahabaah τ and may He bless them and raise their status.
To simplify matters, the “text” of Imaam Ibn Hajar Asqalani (A.R)’s
work on the science of the principles of Ahadeeth is called
“Nukhbatul Fikar”. The classical method of writing was penning a
text which was extremely precise, consice and deep in meaning.
Then in most cases another scholar and in few instances the writer
of the text will pen a “Sharah” (commentary) explaining the text to
some extent. Further another scholar will explain both the text and
the commentary by inserting the “hashia” (marginal notes). Thus on
a typical, classical page of an academic work one will find the text
10

Page 12 of 121

Page 11 of 121
(matn), commentary (sharrah) and marginal notes (hashia). Then
furthermore other scholars note their own commentaries in separate
books.
The current work is a translation of “Tuhfatud Durar” by Allamah
Saeed Ahmed Palanpuri which is a commentary of “Nukhbatul
Fikar” and not “Nuzha tin Nazar Sharah Nukhbatul Fikar” which is
taught in the Darul Ulooms. However, the translation of “Nukhbatul
Fikar” is given also.
The subject matter is tedious for a lay person but good for a student
and necessary for a scholar to know. However, any person reading
will automatically conclude that the science and principle of
Ahadeeth is a highly technical, super classified, totally systemized,
extremely organized, well documented and a properly categorized
field.
We make duaa Allaah rewards all those who aided in making this
work see daylight and become a source to aid those involved in the
study of this neglected science.
A. H. Elias (Mufti)
1427/ 2006

Translators Preface
There are very few works in the English language on the subject of
Usoolul Hadeeth. The average Muslim may not have the slightest
idea of its subject matter and importance. If one just takes a look at
the table of contents, one will find no more than a handful of
English words despite this being an ‘English translation’. This is
because the science of Usool deals specifically with the
terminologies of the Muhadditheen. We have not translated these
terminologies into English since their usage is specific with the
Arabic Term. In the Ahadeeth class, the words Sanad and Matan
will be heard daily. We have maintained these as far as possible and
not used the English equivalents of ‘Chain of Narration’ and ‘Text’.
We have called a Mash-hoor Hadeeth, a Mash-hoor Hadeeth and not
a ‘famous’ Hadeeth. Wherever we deemed necessary, we added
English translations in brackets but have not followed any fixed
pattern in doing so.
This work is aimed primarily at the Daarul Uloom student. It is
hoped that it will be of assistance to the English-speaking student as
the original Kitaab was intended for our Urdu-speaking
counterparts.

Hadhrat Moulana Hafiz Mufti Saeed Ahmed Palanpuri studied in
the renowned Darul Uloom Deoband – India. Taught in Jamia
Ashrafia – Gujuraat for 9 years and currently lecturing in Darul
Uloom Deoband for the last 32 years. He has tutored in every
science of the Dars Nizaami and has become world famous for his
discources and deliberations on Tirmidhi. An average of +_ 1000
students attend these dynamic presentations daily. Fortunetly it has
been documented and soon to be released. Student’s
acknowledgeing his vast, intense depths of knowledge generally
refer to him as “Allamah” and “Bahr ul Uloom”.

The current work explains with proof and laws of the Sunnan of the
Ambiyaa υ. May Allaah Jalla Majdahu, grant us the ability to read,
study and act upon.
A. H. Elias (Mufti)

Besides his tours of U.S.A, U.K, Canada, Zambia, Zimbabwe,
Malawi, South Africa and Turkey, he has written extensively
especially for the scholars.
He has full command over 5 languages i.e Arabic, Persian, Urdu,
Gujuraati and English.
Presently in his life 5 of his works are used as standard text books in
higher Institutes of Learning. He has penned works of reputable
level on Tafseer, Ahadeeth, Principles of Tafseer, Principles of
Ahadeeth, History of Ahadeeth compities, Syntax, Grammar,
Etermology, Jurisprudence, Philosophy and logic.
His latest gigantic master piece is the 5 volumes, commentary of the
magnus opus of Hadhrat Shah Waliullaah Dehlevi (A.R)
“Hujjatullaah Baligha” – called Rahmatutalllah ul Wasiyah” each
volume extending over 850 pages. He has acclodates from most of
academic sources of the world for these sterling services.
This year (1426-2005) we intend translating few of Hadhratul
Ustaad Allamah Saeed Palanpuri’s works and on completion
“Fatawa Rahmiyyah,” we hope to embark on the translation of
“Rahmatullaahi Wasihyaa.” We require your duaas.

The Kitaab ‘Nuzhatun Nazar fee Taudheeh Nukhbatul Fikar fee
Mustalahi Ahlil Athar’ written by Imaam Abul Fadhl Haafiz ibn
Hajar Ahmad ibn Ali Asqalaani (773-852 a.h) is one of the most
widely accepted kitaabs in the field of Usoolul Hadeeth.
Its Matan (text) ‘Nukhbatul Fikar’ has been acclaimed as the basis
and back-bone of this subject.
Generally in our Madaaris, it is the first kitaab taught in this field
and it is also the last.
This being the first kitaab taught in its field, and then being most
unique in its style, and being a kitaab of the highest order, it is no
wonder that majority of our students study the kitaab blindly and
hardly come to grips with this subject at all.
For some time now, I intended to write a sharah (commentary) on
Nukhbah which would be of assistance to the students, and
Alhamdulillaah, we are finally able to present this ‘gift of pearls’ to
our honoured students.
Nukhbah means selected. Fikar is the plural of Fikrah which means
thoughts. Mustalah and Istilaah are Mutaraadif i.e. synonyms
meaning terminology. Athar is another word for Hadeeth.
“Nukhbatul Fikar fee Mustalahi Ahlil Athar” would thus mean
“Selected thoughts and views regarding the terminologies of the
Muhadditheen”
Haafiz Ibn Hajar has in reality gathered thousands of pages in this
treatise. He has ‘gathered the ocean in a cup.’
If the students study this Kitaab well and understand it properly, it
will go a long way in assisting them towards mastering the subject
of Usoolul Hadeeth.
15

Ibn Hajar then wrote a Sharah (commentary) on this kitaab and
named it “Nuzhatun Nazar Sharah Nukhbatul Fikar” which is taught
in our Madaaris. Many times it is referred to as Nukhbah whereas in
reality the Kitaab we study is not Nukhbah but Sharah Nukhbah.
The Kitaab in your hand – “Tuhfatud Durar” is a Sharah of Nukhbah
and not Nuzhah.
I have first placed the text of Nukhbah with its I’raab so that the
students can memorize it correctly. Memorizing the text is an easy
but extremely beneficial task. If a student puts his mind to it, he will
be able to memorize it in a few days, yet its benefits will be lifelong.
I then wrote a simple explanatory translation. The translation is
such, that an average student will be able to understand the Kitaab
directly from it Inshaa-Allaah.
The Sharah follows thereafter. I have attempted to systemize the
entire Kitaab in my Sharah by defining each of the Istilaahaat
(terms) separately.
I do hope that this Kitaab may be of assistance to our students in
mastering the science of Usoolul Hadeeth. To study Nuzhah after
this will be quite simple.
I have taken the basic idea for ‘Tuhfah’ from the Kitaab “Husnun
Nazar” of Moulaana Abdurrahmaan of Madrassah Sulaimaaniyyah
in Bhopaal which Moulaana Aashiq Ilaahi Meerathi had published
over 50 years ago and is now no longer available. I have taken full
benefit from it but have not copied it. Instead I attempted to present
a completely user friendly and easily understandable Kitaab for
today’s student.

All praise is only for Allaah, who from ever before is the possessor
of the most complete knowledge and the owner of all power and
might; and may the choicest mercies and salutations of Allaah be
showered upon our Master, Muhammad Sallallaahu Alaihi wa
Sallam, who He had sent as a carrier of glad tidings and as a clear
warner to the whole of mankind.
‘AmmaaBa’d:’
Many volumes have been written on the subject of Usoolul Hadeeth,
some in great detail and others in brief. Some of my friends have
requested me to compile a booklet for them outlining the more
important aspects from these Kitaabs. Acceding to their requests, I
present this work, by virtue of which I hope to be included among
the servants of Hadeeth.

Aqsaam (types) of Ahaadeeth with regards to
Ta’daadul Asaaneed i.e. the number of Sanads
(chains)

 
So I say: A Khabr [Hadeeth] may have few Turuq/Isnaad (chains);
either of a fixed number or an unfixed amount. There will either be
more than two Sanads or two or one.
The first is known as Mutawaatir, which gives the Faa’idah
(benefit) of Ilmul- Yaqeen with its conditions. The second is called
Mash-hoor and Mustafeedh according to some, while the third is
called Azeez and this is not a Shart (condition) for a Hadeeth to be
Saheeh (authentic) – contrary to the opinion of some people. The
fourth is called Ghareeb. Apart from the first one all the others
(Ahadeeth) are called Aahaad.

  

With regard to the number of Sanads, Ahaadeeth are of four types:
1. Mutawaatir
2. Mash-hoor or Mustafeedh
3. Azeez
4. Ghareeb
Sanad of a Hadeeth and its Matan
The chain of narrators is called Tareeq or Sanad (singular) or else
Turuq or Asaaneed (plural)
The text of the Hadeeth is called its Matan. E.g. Imaam Bukhaari
says: “Makki ibn Ibraaheem said to us that Yazeed ibn Abi Ubaid
told him from Salamah who said that he heard Nabi Sallallaahu
Alaihi wa Sallam saying: “Whoever attributes anything to me which
I have not said should prepare his abode in Jahannum (hell).”
The chain of narrators from Imaam Bukhaari to Salamah is called
the Sanad and the words of Rasoolullaah Sallallaahu Alaihi wa
Sallam form the text which is called the Matan.

1.) A Mutawaatir Hadeeth.
Any Hadeeth having Kathratul Asaaneed (many chains) is called a
Mutawaatir Hadeeth. There is no fixed number in determining
Kathratul Asaaneed.

There are 5 Sharaa’it of Tawaatur:
1.
2.

3.
4.

5.

Kathratul Isnaad (the Hadeeth must have several chains)
It must be narrated by so many people that for all of them
to have conspired or chanced to unite on a lie must be
totally impossible.
This great number of Ruwaat (narrators) must be found
in every generation of the Sanad.
The end of the Riwaayat must be on an Amre-Hissi i.e.
The last Raawi must clearly state that he personally
heard or saw something directly from his Shaikh. There
must be no assumption, hearsay or ambiguity.
The Saami’ (listener) must gain the benefit of IlmulYaqeen from the Khabr/Hadeeth.

Note: This fifth clause, according to some, is not a Shart of
Tawaatur. Instead a Mutawaatir Hadeeth gives the benefit of IlmulYaqeen (according to them).

Page 22 of 121
whatever is mentioned in the Hadeeth will be accepted with full
conviction as being true without the least shadow of doubt.
Note:
1. If after all the Sharaa’it are found, yet for some reason the
Khabr does not give the above mentioned Faaidah, then the
Khabr/Hadeeth will be called Mash-hoor
and not
Mutawaatir.
2. The number of Ruwaat for Tawaatur, despite various
Aqwaal (views) is not fixed. The requisite is that they should
be so many and so widespread that for all of them to have
conspired on a lie, or to have been misled must be
impossible.

Example of a Mutawaatir Hadeeth:
The above-mentioned Hadeeth: “Whosoever falsely attributes
anything to me…” is a Mutawaatir Hadeeth. Similarly the
Ahaadeeth regarding Masah Alal Khuffain and Khatmun
Nubuwwah are also Mutawaatir.
2.) A Mash- hoor Hadeeth
Any Hadeeth having more than two narrators in every
generation of its Sanad, but the number of narrators does not reach
the requirement of Tawaatur will be called a Mash-hoor Hadeeth.
Similarly, any Hadeeth which has all the Sharaa’it of Tawaatur but
does not give the benefit of Ilme Yaqeeni Badeehi will also be
classed as Mash-hoor.

When all the Shara’it are found and a Hadeeth is thus classed as
Mutawaatir, then it gives the benefit of Ilme Yaqeeni Badeehi i.e.

Note: In Urf (society) the word Mash-hoor generally translates as
famous or widespread and may even be used for something
unfounded or baseless. The saying goes “Every Mash-hoor thing is
not necessarily Saheeh” This type of Mash-hoor should not be

21

22

Page 23 of 121
confused with what we are discussing here. We are discussing a
special terminology used by the Muhadditheen.
3.) A Mustafeedh Hadeeth
According to most, a Mustafeedh and Mash-hoor Hadeeth is one
and the same. Some scholars differentiate the two in that if the
number of narrators in every generation of a Mash-hoor Hadeeth is
the same, then that Mash-hoor Hadeeth will be called Mustafeedh.



Page 24 of 121
4.) An Azeez Hadeeth
Any Hadeeth having a minimum of two Raawis (narrators) in
every generation of its Sanad is called Azeez. In no Tabaqah
(generation) should there be less than two.
5.) A Ghareeb Hadeeth
Any Hadeeth having only one Raawi in any generation of its Sanad
is called Ghareeb.

     

Hence, according to the first group, the Nisbah (relation) between
Mash-hoor and Mustafeedh will be one of Tasaawi i.e. every Mashhoor Hadeeth is Mustafeedh and every Mustafeedh Hadeeth is
Mash-hoor; while according to the second, the nisbah will be one of
Umoom-Khusoos i.e. every Mustafeedh Hadeeth will be Mash-hoor
but every Mash-hoor Hadeeth will not be Mustafeedh. (Mustafeedh
is Khaas (specific) and Mash-hoor is Aam (general)).

Example of a Mash-hoor Hadeeth.
There are a number of Mash-hoor Ahaadeeth. Here are two
examples.
1. A true Muslim is he, from whose tongue and hand other
Muslims are safe; and a Muhaajir (emigrant) is he who
abandons that which Allaah has forbidden.
2. None of you can be a true Mu’min until I am more beloved
to him than his own parents and children.

23

It is NOT a Shart (condition/prerequisite) for a Hadeeth to be Azeez
in order for it to be Saheeh. A Ghareeb Hadeeth can also be Saheeh.
The Sihhat of a Hadeeth is dependant on the condition of its
Raawis. Some people are of the view that a Hadeeth must be Azeez
in order to be Saheeh. This is incorrect.


Apart from Mutawaatir; Mash-hoor, Azeez and Ghareeb Ahaadeeth
are all called Aahaad.

Some Aahaad are Maqbool (accepted) whilst others are Mardood
(rejected). Istidlaal (extracting proofs) from Aahaad are Mauqoof
(dependant) on Bahth (investigating the condition) of its Raawis.
This is not so in the case of the first type i.e. Mutawaatir. At times,
due to some Qareenah (external cause), Aahaad may give the
Faa’idah (benefit) of Ilme Nazri (deductive in nature). This is the
Mukhtaar (preferred) view.

Istidlaal (using as proof) from Aahaad is Mauqoof (dependant) on
Tahqeeq (investigating the condition) of its Ruwaat and Ruwaat are
of two types, hence two types of Aahaad. Where all the Ruwaat are
Mu’tabar (reliable), the hadeeth will be Maqbool and where the
Ruwaat are not, it will not be Maqbool.

No it is not. Because of the great number of narrators in every
generation, together with all its other Sharaa’it, there remains no
doubt in the authenticity and truth of a Mutawaatir Hadeeth. For this
reason, Tahqeeq of its Ruwaat is not necessary.

It has already been mentioned that Mutawaatir gives the benefit of

A Khabre Waahid whose narrators are all Mu’tabar and Thiqah

At times Aahaad will give the benefit of Ilme Yaqeeni Nazri or
Istidlaali i.e. when certain requirements are fulfilled, the Khabre
Waahid will be accepted as being authentic and may be used in
Istidlaal (proving some Shar’i matter) This is the correct view.

Then ‘Gharaabah’ will either be found at the Asal of a Sanad (i.e.

word Fard is very seldom used for the second.

Raawi, either in every Tabaqah (level) of its Sanad or in one
Tabaqah.

two types:
1. Farde Mutlaq

Hadeeth i.e. in the Tabaqah (era) of the Taabi’een there is only one
Taabi’ee who narrates the Hadeeth. e.g. Abdullaah ibn Deenaar
narrates from Ibn Umar radhiallaahu Anhu that Rasoolullaah ρ said:
“Walaa’ is a relation like a blood relation. It cannot be sold, nor
given away nor given in Meeraath (inheritance)”

first level of the Sanad. This Gharaabah may continue till the end of
the Sanad i.e. when in every generation of the Sanad there is only
one narrator.

. is where there is “gharaabah” lower down in the
sanad, either in the middle or end of it. At times this Gharaabah may
occur in a peculiar way e.g. there may be many narrators of a certain
Hadeeth from a Shaikh but only one of them may be reliable. In this
manner the Gharaabah or Tafarrud is relative i.e. Bin Nisbati ilaa
Shay’ (Gharaabah due to something).
The difference between Ghareeb and Fard:
In the Arabic language (Lughat), both mean the same thing. The
Muhadditheen generally use the word Fard when describing Farde
Mutlaq and Ghareeb for Farde Nisbee. At times however, they may
use either word for either type.
Note: This difference is only in the word Ghareeb and Fard itself.
There is no difference in the usage of its derivatives (Mushtaqqaat)
Hence ‘Tafarrada bihi Fulaan’ and ‘Aghraba bihi Fulaan’ may both
be used in either instance.

This Hadeeth is an example of Farde Mutlaq because only one
Taabi’ee viz. Abdullaah ibn Deenaar has narrated it.
NOTE: If only one Sahaabi narrates a Hadeeth from Rasoolullaah
ρ, then it will not be called a Ghareeb Hadeeth. The Tafarrud of a
Sahaabi i.e. a Sahaabi’s sole narration of a Hadeeth is of no harm
since the world full of people cannot compare to a single Sahaabi.

Hadeethe Mu’allal: At times a Raawi may mistakenly make a
change or mistake in a Hadeeth or its Sanad. After cross referencing
the various Turuqs of the Hadeeth and comparing them, this mistake
comes to light. This error on the part of the Raawi is known as Illate
Khufyah (a hidden clause) due to which the Hadeeth cannot be
Saheeh li Dhaatihi.

1. all the narrators of a Hadeeth are Aadil/Thiqah (reliable)
2. who have memorized the Hadeeth correctly together with its
Sanad and
3. the sanad of the Hadeeth is Muttasil i.e. it should be
complete with no Raawi missing inbetween
4. it is free of any Illate Khafiyyah (hidden clause) and
5. the Riwaayah is not Shaadh (rare), then the Hadeeth will be
said to be Saheeh li Dhaatihi. [these are the 5 shuroot of
Saheeh li Dhaatihi]

Shaadh: Is that Hadeeth which is narrated by one who is Thiqah,
but it is contrary to a Riwaayah narrated by one who is Awthaq

be Shaadh. This is the correct definition of Shaadh.

Aadil and of Kaamil Dhabt, there will obviously be Tashkeek

higher standard than others in their Adaalat and Dhabt. The
narrations of the Ruwaat will thus vary accordingly, even though all
the Ahaadeeth in question are Saheeh li Dhaatihi.

2. Where there are more than one Sanad to a Hadeeth it would
mean that one Sanad is Saheeh and the other is Hasan.
Note: This explanation of the author (Haafiz ibn Hajar) is according
to his verdict and is not very correct. This discussion is out of the
scope of our present objective. Whoever wishes may research this
matter at his leisure.

And if Saheeh and Hasan are joined, then it is due to Taraddud
(uncertainty) on the part of the narrator. This is in the case of
Tafarrud i.e where only one Sanad exists, or else it would mean that
there are two Sanads.

Imaam Tirmidhi at times classes a Hadeeth as ‘Hadeethun Hasanun
Saheehun’ i.e. he gathers Saheeh and Hasan. This type of ‘double
classification’ is due to two reasons:

 
And the Ziyaadah (addition) of a narrator of a Saheeh or Hasan
Hadeeth is Maqbool (accepted) so long as there is no Munaafi
(opposing view) from one who is Awthaq (more reliable). In the
case of Mukhaalafah (contradiction) between two Thiqah Raawis
the preferred [Raajih] version will be called Mahfooz and the other
[Marjooh] will be called Shaadh and in the case of a Dha’eef
(weak) Raawi opposing a Thiqah (reliable) they will be called
Ma’roof and Munkar respectively.



1. In the case where the Hadeeth has only one Sanad, then it
would mean that Imaam Tirmidhi is undecided in the matter
as to whether a certain Raawi is Taamudh-Dhabt or
Khafeefudh-Dhabt (of perfect memory or a bit wanting) In
this case, the word ‘AW’ (or) would be Mahzoof (hidden)

Mutaaba’at: If a Raawi makes Muwaafaqat with a Farde Nisbee in
the Sanad of a Hadeeth. Muaafaqat means that the second person
narrates a Hadeeth similar to another. These narrations lend strength
to one another.

Shaahid: The Matan of the second Hadeeth is called Shaahid. The
Muwaafaqat may be Lafzan (word for word) or Ma’nan (in meaning
with different wording) – both are acceptable.

other.

contagious in themselves yet mixing with the afflicted in certain
instances could cause it to spread. This is a Sabab (cause) but the

There are two things which cause Radd viz. Ta’n and Saqt


, If any ‘Aib (flaw/weakness) is found in a Raawi which will be
a Maani’ (obstacle) in accepting his Hadeeth it is called Ta’n (lit.
criticism) There are 10 things which are deemed an ‘Aib which we
will discuss later.


!, If any Raawi is omitted in a Sanad it is called Saqt. Saqt is of
two types viz. Waadih (apparent) and Khafi (hidden)


Aqsaam (types) of Saqte Waadih:

 
Then a Mardood Hadeeth will be such either due to Saqt
(criticism) or Ta’n (commission). Then Saqt will either be in the
beginning (Ibtidaa’) of the Sanad being the work of the Musannif
(author) or at the end of the Sanad after the Taabi’ee or it may be
anywhere in between. The first is called Mu’allaq; the second is
called Mursal; and the third is called Mu’dhal if two or more
Raawis are missing consecutively or else it is called Munqati’.



In respect of Saqte Waadih, Hadeethe Mardood is of four types:
1. Mu’allaq
2. Mursal
3. Mu’dhal
4. Munqati’


 !, is that Hadeeth in whose Sanad, the first part (from the
bottom of the Sanad) is omitted i.e. a certain author intentionally
leaves out part of the sanad or the whole of it and simply says:
“Qaala Rasoolullaah Sallallaahu Alaihi wa Sallam…” or he only
includes the names of the Sahaabi or Taabi’ee who narrate the
Hadeeth.
The author may even omit one or two Raawis from the bottom of
the Sanad. All these are known as Mu’allaq.

Hadeethe Mardood
Is a Hadeeth with a Ghair Mu’tabar (unreliable) Raawi

40

Page 41 of 121
Note: In the case of Mishkaat and other such Kitaabs (e.g.
Riyaadhus Saaliheen) the Ahaadeeth will not be said to be Mu’allaq
because the author has not narrated those Ahaadeeth on his own
Sanad. Instead, he has compiled his Kitaab from other sources with
reference (Hawaalah) to those Kitaabs. These Ahaadeeth and
Kitaabs will be called Mujarrad.

Page 42 of 121

 , is when two or more Raawis are omitted consecutively
from the middle of a Sanad.

 !, is when only one Raawi is omitted from the middle of the
Sanad or more than one are omitted but not consecutively.

The Hukm (law) of a Mu’allaq Hadeeth: If the Muhadditheen
who are particular in gathering only Saheeh Ahaadeeth, like
Bukhaari and Muslim, narrate a Mu’allaq Hadeeth with a ‘Seegha of
Jazm’ (a tense of certainty) e.g. Qaala or Dhakara, then the
Riwaayah in question will be said to be Saheeh according to them,
but if they narrate with a ‘Seegha of Tamreedh’ (a tense indicating
uncertainty) e.g. Qeela or Yudhkaru, then the Riwaayah will not be
accepted as is but it will be necessary to make Tahqeeq (research)
regarding it. The Mu’allaq Ahaadeeth of those Muhadditheen who
gather all types of Ahaadeeth will not be accepted without Tahqeeq.

 , is that Hadeeth whose Sanad’s end is not mentioned i.e. A
Taabi’ee says “Qaala Rasoolullaah Sallallaahu Alaihi wa Sallam…”
irrespective of the rank of the Taabi’ee.
Note: There is another type of Mursal which will be discussed later
on.

The Hukm of a Mursal Hadeeth: According to the Hanafis, the
Mursal Ahaadeeth of a person who only leaves out the names of
Thiqah (reliable) Raawis e.g. Sa’eed ibn Musayyib will be accepted.
If a person leaves out the names of even Ghair Thiqah (unreliable)
Raawis at times or habitually, then his Mursal Riwaayaat will not be
accepted because the possibility exists that he may narrate from
another Taabi’ee and not a Sahaabi (and Taabi’een are all not
necessarily Thiqah)

41

 
Then Saqt (omission) is either Waadih (apparent) or Khafi (hidden).
The first type becomes known when Admul Liqaa is proven i.e. that
the two Raawis have not met and for this reason it is necessary to be
aware of Taareekh (history and the dates of birth and death of
people). The second type is called Mudallas and the Hadeeth is
narrated with a word which indicates to the Ihtimaal (possibility) of
Liqaa’ (having met each other) e.g. ‘an and Qaala. And similar to
this is Mursale Khafi which is narrated from a Mu’aasir
(contemporary) who has not been met.


Aqsaam (types) of Saqt
Saqt (where a raawi is left out of a Sanad) is of two types: Waadih
and Khafi

Tadlees: means to hide a fault, from the Arabic usage of the word:

!$"", is that Saqt which is easily discernable.
E.g. it is common knowledge that the two Raawis have not met and
the Riwaayah is not narrated with Ijaazah or Wijaadah.


Ijaazah: The Raawi at times gets permission, written or otherwise,
or through Ijaazate Aammah (general permission) to narrate a
Hadeeth from a Shaikh without having met him or directly hearing
from him.


Wijaadah: is when a Raawi gets hold of the hand written notes of a
certain Shaikh and he narrates on its authority. In this instance,
when narrating, he will say: “Wajadtu bi Khatti Fulaan…” (I have
found this hadeeth written in the hand of so and so…)
Narrating like this is permissible and is called Riwaayah bil
Wijaadah.

Taareekh (history): By studying the Taareekh of Ruwaat we come
to know whether Mu’aasarat and Liqaa took place between them.

Mu’aasarat: when two Raawis lived in the same period. It is quite
obvious that if Mu’aasarat is not established then Liqaa is
impossible.

Liqaa: The meeting of two Raawis. Sometimes two Raawis may be
contemporaries yet Liqaa may not have taken place.

!7 , A hidden saqt. Only a master in the field of Hadeeth
will access this.

“Dallasal Baa’I” which means ‘he hid the flaw in a product’. In the
terminology of the Muhadditheen it is when a Muhaddith hides the
name of a certain Raawi and narrates the rest of the Sanad in a way
that a casual observer cannot make it out.
A person who does this is called Mudallis. The Riwaayah is called
Mudallas and the flaw in the Sanad is called Saqt.

Mudallas: is the Hadeeth in which there is this type of Saqte Khafi.
[Where the Raawi omits the name of his shaikh and takes the name
of his shaikh as if he is narrating from him] e.g. the raawi says: “An
Fulaan” or “Qaala Fulaan”.
Note: if a raawi leaves his shaikh out and makes bayaan (narration)
from the shaikhs shaikh with the lafz (word) of simaa’ (word
indicating to having heard directly) e.g. Sami’tu (meaning I have
heard from so and so) or Qaala lee Fulaan (so and so told me) then
this will be tantamount to Kidhb (a lie) because of which the raawi’s
Adaalah (reliability) will be negatively affected.
Aqsaam (types) of Tadlees:
There are three types of Tadlees most commonly found:
1.
2.
3.

Tadleesul Isnaad
Tadleesush Shuyookh
Tadleesut Taswiyah

 &, This is when a Muhaddith 1] narrates a Hadeeth
from a contemporary whom he has not met i.e. there is Mu’aasarat
but no Liqaa; or 2] he may have met him but he did not hear
anything from him i.e. there is Mu’aasarat and Liqaa but no Simaa’;

44

Page 45 of 121
or 3] he did hear Hadeeth from him but not the Hadeeth which he is
narrating at present. He may have heard the Hadeeth from another of
the Shaikhs students who may be Dha’eef and in all three instances
he narrates in a way that creates an impression of his having heard
the Hadeeth directly.
Baqiyyah ibn Waleed and Waleed ibn Muslim are guilty of this type
of Tadlees. All these three types of Tadlees are Madhmoom
(abhorrent) and are not permissible.

  % (, This is when a Raawi uses an uncommon
(Ghair Ma’roof) name, Kunniyyah (title), Nisbat (link) or Sifat
(quality) for his Shaikh who is Dha’eef so that people may not
become aware of it. This type of Tadlees is Madhmoom but not
impermissible.

   %, Is when a Muhaddith does not omit his
Shaikh but omits a weak Raawi further up in the Sanad so as to hide
its defect and he uses a word of Simaa’ (having heard directly). This
is the worst type of Tadlees and it is Haraam!
Note: If a Raawi omits the name of a Thiqah Shaikh, then although
this is also called Tadlees, it will not be Madhmoom or Haraam as in
the above cases. Sufyaan ibn Uyainah and Bukhaari have done this
at times.

great Muhadditheen have done it on occasion. [Generally the word
Tadlees is used in the first instance.]

All the riwaayats of a habitual Mudallis (who is guilty of the first
kind of Tadlees) are not acceptable. If a Thiqah Raawi does Tadlees,
then his other Riwaayaat will be accepted.

2.

In Ta’leeq the Saqt is Waadih (open) while in Tadlees it
is Khafi (hidden).
Ta’leeq is done for the sake of brevity only whereas
Tadlees is done for an ulterior motive.

Another type of Mursal: sometimes Mursal is used for Mutlaq
Inqitaa’ (any break in the Sanad) whether in the form of Mu’allaq,
Mu’dhal or Munqati’. In the Sihaah Sittah Mursal is very often used
in this way.
Aqsaam (types) of Mursal (in this regard)
1. Mursale Zaahir
2. Mursale Khafi


  8, is the Riwaayah where the Inqitaa’ (break) is
Waadih i.e. The Raawi narrates from a Shaikh who is not a
contemporary.

There are two reasons. The first is when there is a Faasid Ghardh
(evil objective) behind it i.e. he wants to raise the rank of the
Hadeeth by hiding a flaw in its Sanad. This, as was mentioned is
Haraam. The second is when it is done for the sake of brevity
(Ikhtisaar). There is scope for permissibility of this. Several of the

As in Mudallas. Mursale Khafi Riwaayaat are also found with
deceptive words of Simaa’ and Liqaa’. E.g. An Fulaan or Qaala
Fulaan.

In Mudallas, the Hadeeth is attributed to a Shaikh with whom Liqaa
took place but not Simaa’ i.e. he was met but no Hadeeth was heard
from him.
In Mursale Khafi, the Hadeeth is attributed to a Shaikh with whom
only Mu’aasarat is found and not Liqaa.
As such, if any of the Mukhadhrameen 3 say: “Qaala Rasoolullaah
Sallallaahu Alaihi wa Sallam…” then the Riwaayah will be called
Mursale Khafi and not Mudallas.

And then Ta’n (criticism) is either due to Kidhbur Raawi (a lie) or
Tuhmat (accusation) of it.

or Fisq (transgression) or Wahm (confusion) or Mukhaalafat
(contradiction) or Jahaalah (ignorance of his Haal) or Bid’ah
(innovation) or Soo’ul Hifz (weak memory)


The Bayaan (discussion) of Ta’n:
The second cause of Radd (rejecting a Hadeeth) is Ta’n. Ta’n in
Arabic means to stab or injure or find a fault. Technically it will
mean an objection due to a fault.

not proven to have intentionally fabricated a Hadeeth but there are
certain Qaraa’in (signs and indications) which leave us in doubt

This Tuhmat (accusation) comes about in two ways:
1. A person narrates things which are contrary to Qawaa’ide
Ma’loomah i.e. accepted fundamentals of Sharee’at, and
2. Apart from his narrating Hadeeth, he habitually lies in his day-today affairs.

to one group is Munkar and the fourth and fifth likewise.

for some other reason and he narrates contrary to a Thiqah Raawi,

causes a defect in it. A Mu’allal Riwaayah is one which has been
changed [Tabaddul/ Taghayyur] through Wahm (misunderstanding)
and this change or Wahm comes to light through some sign or
indication to it or after gathering the various chains of the Hadeeth.
Note: A Mu’allal Hadeeth is also called Ma’lool at times, but
Allaamah Ibn Salaah and Imaam Nawawi do not consider it correct.
Defining Wahm: Only a Muhaddith of the highest order, with a
perfect memory and broad overview of the Sanads and Matans of
Ahaadeeth can pinpoint a Wahm and single out Ma’lool Ahaadeeth.

be called Mudrajul Matan; and if due to Taqdeem and Ta’kheer, it
will be called Maqloob; and if due to an addition of a Raawi in the
Sanad, it will be called Mazeed fee Muttasilul Asaaneed; and if due
to changing a Raawi and there is no way of giving Tarjeeh, it will be
called Mudhtarab – and the changing of a Raawi is sometimes
intentional by way of Imtihaan- and if the Mukhaalafat is due to a
change in Huroof while the Siyaaqus Sanad is in order, it will be
called Musah-haf or Muharraf.


Aqsaam (types) of Mukhaalafat (conflict)
Mukhaalafatuth Thiqaat is when a weaker Raawi narrates anything
in conflict to that narrated by a Thiqah Raawi. This Mukhaalafah
can be in any of six ways:
1.
Mudrajul Isnaad
2.
Mudrajul Matan

53

changed due to which there is Mukhaalafah in the Sanad of the
Hadeeth. This is of four types:
a.
The first type: Where one Hadeeth is heard from several
Asaatidhah (teachers) with several Sanads, but when
narrating, he does not narrate each ones Sanad separately
but gathers all the Sanads into one and then narrates.
b.
The second type: Where a Shaikh narrates a Hadeeth
with one Sanad and then narrates a portion of the
Hadeeth with another Sanad. The student narrates all of it
on the first Sanad OR the student may have heard a
Hadeeth from a Shaikh and a part of it from one of the
Shaikhs students, but he narrates all of it on the Shaikhs
Sanad.
c.
The third type: A Raawi has two Ahaadeeth with two
Sanads but he narrated both on one Sanad OR he
narrated the first Hadeeth with its Sanad and then
narrated part of the second without mentioning its Sanad
so that it seems as if it is on the first Sanad as well.
d.
The fourth type: The Shaikh mentioned the Sanad of a
Hadeeth. Then before narrating its text, he said a few
things. The student mistook this as the Matan of the
Sanad and narrated it as such.

- # , is when some other wording is incorporated
into the Matan of a Hadeeth in a way that the actual Matan and the
addition cannot be made apart.

54

Page 55 of 121
N.B. if the addition is the Kalaam (speech) of a Sahaabi, then too it
would be termed as Idraaj/Mudraj.
Note: Intentional Idraaj is Haraam and tantamount to falsely
attributing something to Rasoolullaah ρ.

. ! , is that Hadeeth wherein Taqdeem (forward) or
Ta’kheer (delayed) has taken place in the Sanad or Matan i.e. some
of the names of the Ruwaat or some of the wording in the text has
been forwarded or delayed e.g. In the Sanad, instead of Murrah ibn
Ka’b a person says Ka’b ibn Murrah; or in the Matan he says:
i.e. “so that the right hand does not know what the left has spent”
instead of “so that the left hand does not know what the right has
spent”

1   , is when a Raawi mistakenly
adds a Waastah (an extra narrator) in the chain of a Muttasil Sanad.
e.g. The Sanad of a Hadeeth is: “Zaid narrated from Amr who
narrated from Khaalid…”
Another person narrates it as: “Zaid narrated from Bakr who
narrated from Amr and he from Khaalid.

2 5, is a Hadeeth in whose Sanad or Matan there is a
change (Tabaddul or Taghayyur) due to which there is an Ikhtilaaf
(difference) with a Thiqah Raawi and there is no way of giving
Tarjeeh (preference) to one over the other.
Note: If Tarjeeh is possible, then the Raajih Hadeeth will be
Maqbool and the Marjooh Hadeeth will be Mardood. This will not
be called Mudhtarab.

Page 56 of 121
There is a Hadeeth: “When any of you performs Salaah, he should
place something in front of him, and if he finds nothing, then he
should plant an ‘Asaa (staff), and if he cannot, then he should draw
a line so then nothing which passes in front of him will harm him.”
The Sanads of this Hadeeth are as follows:
a)
Ismaa’eel ibn ‘Ulayyah from Abi ‘Amr ibn Muhammad
ibn ‘Amr ibn Huraith from his grandfather Huraith ibn
Saleem from Abu Hurairah [ibn Maajah]
b)
Ismaa’eel ibn Umayyah narrates from Abu ‘Amr ibn
Muhammad ibn Huraith who heard his grandfather
Huraith saying from Abu Hurairah [Abu Dawood]
c)
Ismaa’eel ibn ‘Ulayyah from Abu Muhammad ibn ‘Amr
ibn Huraith from his grandfather Huraith- a man from the
clan Banu ‘Adhrah from Abu Hurairah [Abu Dawood]
d)
Ismaa’eel from Abi ‘Amr ibn Huraith from his father
from Abu Hurairah
e)
Ismaa’eel from Abi ‘Amr ibn Muhammad ibn Huraith
from his father…
f)
Ismaa’eel from Huraith ibn Ammaar…
Each Sanad here is different. This is a classic example of Idhtiraab!!

An example of Idhtiraab in Matan:
a) The Hadeeth of Faatimah bint Qays in Tirmidhi (pg. 83) –
narrated by Shareek from Abi Hamzah from Sha’bi from
Faatimah who says: “There are dues on wealth apart from
Zakaat”
The same Hadeeth in Ibn Maajah with the same Sanad goes:
“There is no due on wealth apart from Zakaat”

It is not permissible to alter the wording of a Hadeeth, whether it be
Ikhtisaar of a Taweel Hadeeth (to shorten a long Hadeeth) or to use
a Muraadif word (synonym). However, for a Muhaddith who is a
master in Ma’aani Lughawiyyah (lexicology) and the use of words
and the laws of Nahw and Sarf (grammar and syntax) it may be
permissible at times on condition that his change in wording does
not affect the meaning of the Hadeeth in any way [This is known as
Riwaayat bil Ma’na]. The best course in any case is not to change
anything and to narrate the Hadeeth as is word for word [This is
known as Riwaayat bil Lafz]. It should be born in mind that the
words and wording used by Rasoolullaah ρ were inspired by Allaah
and thus carry a special meaning and deeper implication, which
cannot be encompassed in anyone else’s word.
Bukhaari has narrated the Hadeeth of Baraa ibn ‘Aazib, that
Rasoolullaah ρ taught him a Du’a before going to bed:
Scan Ibaarat pg 38
>
Baraa repeated the words to Rasoolullaah ρ for confirmation and in
place of “Nabiyyika” said “Rasoolika”, Rasoolullaah ρ said: “Say
Nabiyyika” i.e. do not substitute it with Rasoolika (even though both
words have the same meaning and every Rasool is definitely a
Nabi).

Bayaanul Mushkil: Some Ahaadeeth have deep meanings which
cannot be understood simply which may give rise to objections e.g.
Rasoolullaah ρ said: “Three things have been made beloved to me
viz. women, perfume and the coolness of my eyes which is in
Salaat” These narrations are known as Mushkil and the explanation
thereof is known as Bayaan.
Kitaabs like Imaam Tahaawi’s “Bayaan Mushkilul Aathaar” and
Khattaabi’s “Ma’aalimus Sunan” deal solely with this topic.

Sharhul Ghareeb: At times an uncommon or seldom used word
may appear in a Hadeeth. This is known as a Ghareeb Lafz. In such
instances, it will be necessary to explain this word. This is known as
Sharhul Ghareeb (explanation of a Ghareeb word). The Ulamaa
have written Kitaabs deliberating only with this. Three Kitaabs in
this line are most often used:

Then Jahaalah, its Sabab (cause) could be any of the following: a
Raawi may have several qualities and may be described by one of
his less known ones for some reason. Muhadditheen have written
the ‘Muwadhihaat’ which deal with this. Or a Raawi may have
narrated only a few Ahaadeeth, and as such, only a little benefit may
have accrued from him. They have written the ‘Wuhdaan’ which
deal with this. Or at times, for brevity, the Raawis name may be
omitted. So they wrote the ‘Mubhamaat’. The Mubham Raawi is
not acceptable even though a word of Ta’deel is used for him
according to the most Saheeh Qowl (opinion). Then if his name is
taken but only one person narrates from himthen he will be called
Majhoolul’Ain and if two or more narrate from him without
affirming (Tautheeq) then he will be known as Majhoolul Haal and
this is the same as Mastoor.

The Riwaayah of an unknown person is not acceptable because if
his name is not known then his Haal (condition) cannot be defined
(as to whether he is reliable or not).

The Saheeh (correct) verdict is that a Mubham (unknown) Raawi
cannot be declared as Aadil (reliable) e.g. If a person says
“Akhbaranee Thiqatun” (a reliable person informed me), even then
the Riwaayah is not acceptable since the testimony of this person is
also unclear. The exception is if a reputed Muhaddith of the highest

these people are preceded by their reputation.

Similarly, Abu Hurairah’s name i.e. Abdurrahmaan ibn Sakhar is

Kitaabs called ‘Mubhamaat’ on these Raawis and who they are.

A Sahaabi is a person who met Rasoolullaah ρ in the condition of
Imaan and died with Imaan. If after Imaan, he turned Murtad
(apostate) and then accepted Islaam again, he will still be regarded
as a Sahaabi according to Imaam Shaafi’ee; while according to
Imaam Maalik and Imaam Abu Haneefah, he will not be called a
Sahaabi unless he met Rasoolullaah ρ again. This is because when a
person accepts Islaam, all his previous sins are obliterated and when
a person forsakes Islaam, all his previous good deeds are obliterated.
Ibn Hajar was of the Shafi’ee Madh-hab and therefore supported the
view of Shaafi’ee calling it Asah (most correct) whereas the second
view is supported by stronger Dalaa’il (proofs)

Hukm of Marfoo’ since Sahaabah only did things with the consent
of Rasoolullaah ρ and since the actions of Sahaabah are a Hujjat

Musnad is a special terminology among the Muhadditheen.
Sometimes a Hadeeth is classed as Musnad, the plural of Musnad is
Masaaned. Some collections of Ahaadeeth are classed as Masaaned.
e.g. the Musnad of Ahmad, the Masaaneed of Abu Haneefah.

Faa’idah/Note: Some people consider every Muttasil Hadeeth as
Musnad whether Marfoo’, Mauqoof or Maqtoo’ and some consider
every Marfoo’ Hadeeth as Musnad whether Mursal, Mu’dhal or
Munqati’. The most correct version is the one we have mentioned
above.

The Arabic word is used ‘Asnadahu fil Jabal’ – He climbed the
mountain.
The word Musnad is ‘Ism Maf’ool’ meaning ‘something which has
been climbed’ and in the terminology of the Muhadditheen it is a
saying (riwaayah) whose Sanad has reached the Qaa’il (speaker).
Then the word Musnid is ‘Ism Faa’il’ meaning ‘the one who
climbed to the top’ and among the Muhadditheen it refers to the
Madaar (source/fountainhead) of the Sanad e.g. Shah Waliullaah is
known as Musnidul Hind because he is the Madaar of Hadeeth in
the sub-continent. The Sanads of all the Muhaddithen source
through him.

Is when a person has a Sanad to the Musannifs Shaikhs Shaikh
[other than their Sanad] and the number of Ruwaat in the second

Examples of Muwaafaqat and Badal
Bukhaari narrates from Qutaibah ibn Sa’eed who narrates from
Maalik.
If we find a Sanad to Qutaibah by passing Bukhaari, this will be
called Muwaafaqat.
If we find a Sanad to Maalik by passing Bukhaari and Qutaibah, it
will be called Badal.

If we have a Sanad to Rasoolullaah ρ with an equal number of
Ruwaat as a Musannif has on his Sanad, then this will be
Musaawaat between us and the Musannif. E.g. Nasa’i has 10
narrators to Rasoolullaah ρ. We have a Sanad which does touch
Nasa’i which also has 10 narrators. This is Musaawaat between us

1) For a Hadeeth to be declared Saheeh, it is necessary to
research each Raawis condition. Thus the fewer the number
of Ruwaat the higher the level of the Sanad. In this way, the
highest Sanad in Bukhaaris Kitaab are Thulaathiyaat11
[Sanads with three Raawis between him and Rasoolullaah ρ]
and the highest Sanad in Maaliks Muatta are Thunaa’ee12
[Sanads with two Raawis inbetween]
2) An ‘Aali Sanad is only counted if its Ruwaat are all Thiqah.
If the Ruwaat of a Naazil Hadeeth are higher in Thaqaahat
then it will be counted higher than the Sanad with less
narrators.
3) A Maudhoo’ Hadeeth and Sanad are of no standing at all
immaterial of how ‘Aali it may be.
4) Just as there are Maraatib (ranks) in ‘Aali Sanads, similarly
there are Maraatib in Naazil Sanads.

If the Raawi and his Shaikh are of equal age and Liqaa bil
Asaatidhah (meeting their Ustaads) then it is called Riwaayatul
Aqraan. If they narrate from each other it is called Mudabbaj. If a
person narrates from one who is ‘lower’ than him it is called
Riwaayatul Akaabir anil Asaaghir. One type of this is when a father
narrates from his son. And the opposite of this is very common and
among this is when a person narrates from his father from his
grandfather (An Abeehi An Jaddihi)



Note 1: Mudaabaj is Khaas (specific) while Aqraan is Aam
(general). In Mudabbaj it is necessary for both sides to narrate from
each other while in Aqraan only one side has to narrate. Hence
every Mudabbaj is Aqraan but every Aqraan is not Mudabbaj.
Note 2: If an Ustaad narrates from his student it is not called
Mudabbaj. It is called Riwaayatul Akaabir Anil Asaaghir because an
Ustaad and Student are of the same age/era but are not
contemporaries.

Note: All the Sanads which read ‘An Abeehi ‘An Jaddihi (from his
father from his grandfather) fall under this grouping. In this text,
both the Dhameers (pronoun) refer to the first person e.g. “Bahz ibn
Hakeem An Abeehi An Jaddihi” will mean that Bahz reports from
his father (Hakeem) and Hakeem reports from Bahz’s grandfather
who in this case is Mu’aawiyah ibn Haydah Radhiallaahu Anhu.

The duration between two such Raawis has been found to a
maximum of about 150 years!! Abu Ali Bardaani (died 498 a.h.)
narrated a Hadeeth from Haafiz Abu Taahir Silafi (not Salafi) who
died in 576 a.h. and Abu Taahirs last student was his grandson Abu
Qaasim ibn Makki (died 650 a.h.) Bardaani is the Saabiq and Abu
Qaasim is the Laahiq with a time difference of 150 years in
between!

There is one exception to this rule – That is the Sanad of “Amr ibn
Shu’aib An Abeehi An Jaddihi” In this instance, the Riwaayah is
from Amr who narrates from his father Shu’aib, and Shu’aib
narrates from his grandfather i.e. Abdullaah ibn Amr ibnul Aas
Radhiallaahu Anhu. Here the Dhameer in Jaddihi refers to Shu’aib
not Amr. The genealogy of this Sanad is as follows - Amr ibn
Shu’aib ibn Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Amr ibnul Aas.

Through the Laahiq a person can gain a high Sanad (uluww)
because narrating through the Saabiq (who died years before) will
entail narrating through a few more Raawis. Narrating through the
Laahiq will shorten the Sanad and end any doubt of Tadlees and
Saqt.

And if two people both narrate from the same Shaikh and one dies
before the other then these two are known as Saabiq and Laahiq.

If a person with certainty (Yaqeen) rejects a Hadeeth which was
attributed to him then it will be as he says. If he is in doubt it will be

Is when all the Raawis of a Hadeeth narrate with one Seegha (tense)

Is when the Shaikh says: “I do not remember narrating such a
Hadeeth” or he says: “I do not know such a Hadeeth”. In this case,
the most Saheeh Madh-hab is that the Hadeeth will be accepted
since there is possibility that he may have forgotten and the Raawi is
Thiqah.
Note: Imaam DaarQutni has written a Kitaab “Man Haddatha wa
Nasiya” in which he has gathered many examples of where the
Shaikh narrated a Hadeeth and then forgot.

Example of Wahdate Seegha:
When every Raawi in the Sanad narrates with Sami’tu or
Haddathanaa (I heard… or so and so narrated to us…)

Example of Wahdate Qowliyyah and Fi’liyyah:
Anas τ narrates Marfoo’an that Rasoolullaah ρ said: “A slave (of
Allaah) can never taste the sweetness of Imaan until he does not
believe in Taqdeer…” Anas says: “at this point, Rasoolullaah ρ held
his Mubaarak beard and said: “I believe in Taqdeer”” While
narrating this Hadeeth, every Raawi in turn held his beard and said:
“Aamantu bil Qadr”

Example of Wahdate Qowliyyah

And if the Raawis are Muttafiq on the Seegha (tense) of Adaa

Musalsal.

Rasoolullaah ρ said to Mu’aadh: “I love you for the sake of Allaah!
O Mu’aadh, say after every Salaat ‘O Allaah! Assist me in doing
your Dhikr and in being grateful to you (Shukr) and in beautifying
my Ibaadat to You.’” Every Raawi while narrating this Hadeeth
addressed his students with the words of Rasoolullaah ρ: “Innee

The first two are when a person alone hears from the mouth of the
Shaikh and the plurals thereof are if there is more than one student.
The first word is the most clear (Waadih) and the highest in Imlaa

The 3rd and 4th are for a person who reads to the Shaikh and if they
are used in the plural then it is just like the 5th word.
Inbaa’ is in the meaning of Ikhbaar but according to the Muta’akhkhireen, it is used for Ijaazah like ‘An and ‘AnAnah of a
contemporary (Mu’aasir) are based on Simaa’ (hearing) but the
‘AnAnah of a Mudallis is excluded, while some scholars have
placed the Shart (condition) of Liqaa (that the two must have met)
even if only once – and this is the preferred view.
Then the word Mushaafahah is for oral Ijaazah and Mukaatabah is
for written Ijaazah (permission).
Munaawalah is when the Shaikh gives his Kitaab to a person. The
Muhadditheen have put the Shart of Ijaazah with it for it to be
Saheeh. And Munaawalah is the highest level of Ijaazah.
And like this in Wijaadah, Wasiiyyah and I’laam, there is the Shart
of Ijaazah.
Aam Ijaazah and Ijaazah to a Majhool and to a Ma’doom are all
baseless, and this is the Saheeh view.

According to Bukhaari there is a third Shart i.e. the Liqaa’ (meeting)
between the two must be proven, even if only once. Mu’aasarat
alone is not sufficient.
Ibn Hajar has called this the preferred view but Imaam Muslim has
very strongly opposed this in the Muqaddamah of his Kitaab. Some
say that Bukhaari used this third Shart as a criterion for accepting
Ahaadeeth in his Saheeh only, other than that, his standpoint is just
like the rest (i.e. of two Sharaa’it).
Note: If after Qaala or Dhakara (so and so said…) the word lee or
lanaa comes (i.e. so and so said to me or to us…) then it will be
taken to mean Simaa’ (having heard directly) but by way of
Mudhaakarah (casual mention) and not Tahdeeth (formal narration
of Hadeeth) and thus will not be taken as Ijaazah (permission to
narrate)

Are two Raawis
1.
Whose father’s names are similar in writing yet different
in Talaffuz (pronounciation) e.g. Muhammad ibn Aqeel
(Nishapuri) and Muhammad ibn Uqail (Firyaabi).
2.
The opposite of the above e.g. Shuraih ibn Nu’maan
(Taabi’ee) and Suraih ibn Nu’maan (Bukhaari’s ustaad).
3.
Whose names and parents names are the same but the
Nisbats are different in pronounciation e.g. Muhammad
ibn Abdullaah Mukharrimi (ustaad of Bukhaari) and
Muhammad ibn Abdullaah Makhrami (student of
Shaafi’ee).
Note: Mutashaabih comprises partly of the first two types together.
Some times Mutashaabih will be similar to Muttafiq wa Muftariq
and sometimes to Mu’talif wa Mukhtalif - e.g. Muhammad ibn
Aqeel and Muhammad ibn Uqail. The two Muhammads are
Muttafiq wa Muftariq while Aqeel and Uqail are Mu’talif wa
Mukhtalif.
More Aqsaam (types)
By putting all three together, several more types emerge.
1. In name, father’s name, grandfather’s name etc there is
similarity
a. but for one or two syllables/letters in which there is
no similarity e.g. Ahmad ibn Hussain and Ahyad ibn
Hussain – Ja’far ibn Maysarah and Hafs ibn
Maysarah – Muhammad ibn Sinaan and Muhammad
ibn Sayyaar. OR
b. the letters are the same but for a change in dots e.g.
Abdullaah ibn Zaid and Abdullaah ibn Yazeed –
Abdullaah ibn Yahya and Abdullaah ibn Nujayy.

Note: some of these differences will only come to light when the
names are written in Arabic.
2. In writing and pronounciation the names are the same but the
difference is in Taqdeem or Takheer (order) this is in also in
two ways:
a. the names are reversed as in Aswad ibn Yazeed and

b. the letters are shifted e.g Ayoob ibn Yasaar and

The ranks of the Muhadditheen. This is in respect of age and era.

Why this distinction?
1. So that we can recognize Tadlees.
2. To make out whether ‘An’Anah is Simaa’ee or not i.e.
whether it was heard directly or not.
3. To make out Mutashaabih Ruwaat from each other13.
Note: Sometimes one Raawi may fit into two categories/ranks. E.g.
Anas ibn Maalik τ will fit into the rank of the Asharah
Mubashsharah due to Ilm and closeness to Rasoolullaah ρ and also
among the Sighaar (junior) Sahaabah due to his tender age.
At times some Ruwaat will fit between two categories.

Twelve Tabaqaat:

Conclusion: And among the important matters in this field is to
know the Tabaqaat (ranks) of Ruwaat and their dates of birth and
demise and the cities they reside in and traveled to and their general
conditions in respect of Jarh, Ta’deel and Jahaalat…

Ibn Hajar has placed the narrators of the Sihaah Sittah in twelve
categories in his Kitaab “Taqreebut Tahdheeb’. This is classification
is peculiar to him. It is as follows:
1. All the Sahaabah Kiraam Radhiallaahu Anhum.
2. The Kibaar (senior) Taabi’een like Sa’eed ibn Musayyab and
the Mukhadhrameen.
3. The ‘Middle’ Taabi’een like Hasan al Basri and Muhammad
ibn Seereen.
4. Those linked to the above but a little lower e.g. Zuhri and
Qataadah

Khaatimah - Conclusion
Here six important matters will be discussed. It is necessary for the
student of Hadeeth to be conversant with them.

All of these terms have already been discussed in detail.

5. The Sighaar (junior) Taabi’een who have only met a few
Sahaabah e.g. Imaam Abu Haneefah14 and Abu Sulaimaan
A’mash. (some of these may not have narrated from
Sahaabah)
6. Those who lived in the era of the above but did not meet any
of the Sahaabah e.g. Ibn Juraij
7. The Kibaar Tabe’Taabi’een like Imaam Maalik and Sufyan
Thowree.
8. The ‘middle’ Tabe’Taabi’een like Sufyaan ibn Uyainah and
Ismaa’eel ibn Ulayyah.
9. The Sighaar Tabe’Taabi’een like Imaam Shaafi’ee, Abu
Dawood Tayaalisee and AbdurRazzaaq San’aanee.
10. The seniors of the next era (who did not meet any Taabi’ee)
e.g. Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal.
11. The ‘Middle’ among the students of the Tabe’Taabi’een e.g.
Bukhaari and Zuhali.
12. The minors of this generation like Tirmidhi and others.

Ahwaalur Ruwaat is their detailed condition so that we can make
out good narrators from the weak ones because the acceptance of
every Hadeeth is based on this.

 
And (among these matters is) the Maraatib of Jarah – the worst
Jarah is on the scale of Af’alu e.g. Akdhabun Naas then Dajjaal or
Wadhdhaa’ or Kadhdhaab and the lightest of them are Layyin or
Sayyi’ul Hifz or Feehi Maqaal…

(Jarah – to criticize a Raawi negatively.) Jarah has many levels,
some are very severe while others are light.

Their cities and travels are necessary so that we can make out
whether they met or not and so that we can differentiate Raawis of
the same name by their Nisbats (links to cities/surnames)
14
Imaam Abu Haneefah was born in 80 A.H. when many Sahaabah were still living.
Imaam Saahib met several Sahaabah and even narrated Ahaadeeth from them. He met
Sayyidina Anas τ. Twenty great Ulamaa have attested to this! For details check Qawaa’id
fee Uloomil Hadeeth with the Tahqeeq of Shaikh Abdul Fattaah.

101

The worst Jarah: is when the Seegha of Tafdheel (Af’alu) is used
for a Raawi e.g. Akdhabun Naas (the greatest liar of his time)
Mutawassit (medium) Jarah: is if a Raawi is called Dajjaal,
Wadhdhaa’ or Kadhdhaab (great deceiver, or fabricator or great liar)

102

Page 103 of 121
‘Light’ Jarah: is if a Raawi is called Layyin (soft / not very
cautious) or Sayyi’ul Hifz (of a weak memory) or Feehi Maqaal
(there is something about him)

Page 104 of 121
In Taqreeb, Ibn Hajar has mentioned twelve levels of Jarah and
Ta’deel.
These classifications are also Makhsoos (special) to him i.e. they are
his own ‘invention’ but are now quite commonly used.

 
And the levels of Ta’deel: the highest is to use a Seegha of Af’alu
like Awthaqun Naas then that which is supported by a Sifat or two
e.g. Thiqatun Thiqatun or Thiqatun Haafizun and the lightest is that
which is close to the lowest level of Jarah e.g. Shaikhun…



3  ,
Like Jarah, Ta’deel is also of several levels:
The Highest type of Ta’deel: is also on the scale of Af’alu e.g.
Awthaqun Naas (the most reliable of people).
Mutawassit: is that which is emphasized by one or two Sifaat
(quality) e.g. Thiqatun Thiqatun (very reliable) or Thiqatun
Haafizun (a very reliable Haafiz of Hadeeth)
‘Light’ Ta’deel: is that which is close to the lowest level of Jarah
e.g Shaikh (an Aalim) or Yurwaa Hadeethuhu (his Ahaadeeth may
be relayed) or Yu’tabaru Bihi (His Ahaadeeth may be accepted as
Shawaahid to strengthen another Hadeeth).

1. A Sahaabi (this is the highest level of Ta’deel since
Sahaabah are the best of mankind)
2. Those Ruwaat who the Imaams of Jarah and Ta’deel have
emphatically acclaimed irrespective of the word used to
describe him.
3. Are those Ruwaat who have been acclaimed with one Sifat
e.g. Thiqah or Mutqin or Thabat or Aadil (all meaning
reliable or trustworthy)
4. Are those a little lower in rank. Haafiz used the words
‘Sadooq’ (truthful) and ‘Laa Ba’sa Bihi’(nothing wrong with
him) to describe them.
5. Lower than no.4 described as ‘Sadooq Sayyiul Hifz’
(truthful but of weak memory) or ‘Sadooq Yukhti’ (truthful
but errs at times) ‘Sadooq Taghayyara fee Aakhirihi’
(truthful but he became senile in later age)
6. Are those from who very few Ahaadeeth are narrated and no
Jarah (accusation) is leveled against him due to which any of
his narrations are discarded. Any Muttabi’ (supportive
narration) of his is acceptable.
7. Are those from whom more than one student has narrated but
no Imaam has made his Tawtheeq. These are known as
Mastoor or Majhool.
8. Those who are declared Dha’eef with no detail as to
why.(Jarah Mubham).
9. Those who have only one student and are declared Majhool
(unknown).

10. Those who are extremely Dha’eef with no Ta’deel to their
credit. These are called Matrook (discarded) or Waahiul
Hadeeth (very weak).
11. Those accused of Kidhb (lies) because their narrations are
contrary to the Qawaa’ide Asliyyah15 of Islaam or he may be
a habitual liar in his everyday dealings.

Saheeh.

 

And the Ta’deel (testimony) of even a single person who is aware of
the Asbaab (causes/ requirements) of this field is acceptable - and
this is the Saheeh Qowl.

discussed.

The Ta’deel of a person who is fully aware of the requirements of

if only one such person makes Ta’deel of a Raawi it will be
accepted. Some people say two are required as this is the number

Qawaaide Asliyyah: the accepted foundations of Deen proven from Qur’aan and
Hadeeth.

105

And Jarah is Muqaddam (given preference) over Ta’deel if the Jarah
is from an Imaam. And if no one has made Ta’deel of a Majrooh
(accused) Raawi then this Mujmal (unspecified) Jarah will be
accepted – and this is the accepted view.

the Jarah will be taken into account on condition that 1 – The
reasons for Jarah are clearly mentioned (this is called Jarah
Mubayyan as opposed to Mubham- where the reasons of Jarah are
not mentioned) and 2 – The person declaring the Jarah must be an


Fasl: (sub-chapter)
In the Khaatimah, six things were discussed followed by 2 Masaa’il.
Now a few more things will be discussed regarding the names of
Ruwaat.

7 %*  ',
If the Ruwaat in the Sanad are commonly known by their Kunniyats,
then it is necessary to know them since they may at times be called
by their names and at times by their Kunniyah. If the student does
not know both he will fall into error. E.g. Abdullaah ibn Umar τ is
often called Abu Abdurrahmaan.

 
And among these is to know the titles (Kunniyah) that go with
names and names that go with the titles, then those whose names
(Asmaa) are their titles, and those in whose Kunniyah there is
Ikhtilaaf (difference of opinion) and those with several
(Muta’addad) titles or Sifaat (descriptive qualities) and those whose
Kunniyah is the same as their father’s names and vice versa, then
those whose titles are similar to that of their wives, and then where
the Ustaad and father have the same name, and those who are linked
to someone other than the father, or those whose Nisbah cannot be

'*  7 %,
Some Raawis are more often called by their titles. To know their
names is necessary for the above-mentioned reason e.g. Ibn Shihaab
Zuhri’s (Taabi’ee) name is Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn Ubaidullaah
ibn Abdullaah ibn Shihaab Zuhri. At times his name may be used in
the Sanad and not his title. Similarly, Abu Bakr τ’s name is
Abdullaah ibn Uthmaan and his father’s Kunniyah is Abu
Quhaafah!

This is a very brief summary on the Masaail of Jarah and Ta’deel. There are many salient
details and finer points to this subject which are not discussed here.

Some Raawis have only a Kunniyah with no name or Laqab. Some

And then to know Asmaaul Mujarradah and Mufradah and
Kunniyahs and Laqabs and Ansaab and Nisbats are sometimes
(associated) to tribes and at times to abodes/cities and these are of
few types viz. Bilaad, Dhiyaa’, Sikak, Mujaawarah. And Nisbats are
at times (associated) to professions and there may be Ittifaaq or
Ishtibaah in any of these names. Sometimes Nisbats may become
Laqabs. To know the Asbaab of all of these is necessary for the
student of Hadeeth...

!,
Laqabs are sometimes names like Safeenah τ and at times
Kunniyahs like Abu Turaab (the Laqab of Ali τ) and sometimes a

following things. All of these are related to the recognition of
Ruwaat.

Some Raawis have only a single name with no Laqab or Kunniyah

A Nisbat is sometimes to a tribe e.g. Dowsi (of the Dows tribe) –
generally among the Mutaqaddimeen Nisbats where of this type.
Sometimes it is to a Watan (hometown) e.g. Dehlawi (from Delhi) –
the Nisbats of the Muta’akhkhireen are generally of this type. Then
Nisbat of this type may be to a city or farm or suburb or
neighborhood or to a profession or skill like Khayyaat (a tailor).
Note 1:
Just as there is Ittifaaq and Ishtibaah (similarity) in names, there
may be the same in Nisbats e.g. Hanafi is Nisbat to the Hanafi
Madh-hab or the tribe Banu Haneefah.

It is necessary to know why people have certain titles or Nisbats.
E.g. Abu Mas’ood Uqbah ibn Amr Ansaari τ is known as Badri.
This is not because he took part in the Battle of Badr but because he
later settled in Badr. Mu’aawiyah ibn Abdul Kareem is known as
Dhaal (lit. astray) because he got lost en-route to Makkah! and
Ishaaq ibn Ibraaheem’s father is known as Raahooyah (of the road)
because he was born on the road to Makkah!

having several meanings e.g. Mawlaa A’laa is the person who freed
a slave; Mawlaa Asfal is the freed slave; Mawlaa bil Half is an ally;
Mawlaa bil Islaam is the person at whose hands another accepted
Islaam etc. So it is necessary to make out the type of Mawlaa e.g.
Aabil Lahm Ghifaari Mawlaa Umair Radhiallaahu Anhu was the
master of Umair, he later freed him; Naafi’ Mawlaa ibn Umar was
the slave of Ibn Umar who was set free and Imaam Bukhaari is also
called Ju’fi on account of Walaa’ul Islaam.

It is necessary to make brothers and sisters apart e.g. Ubaidullaah

student and teacher; and the age of Tahammul and Adaa and the
method of writing Hadeeth and comparing and listening to and
narrating it and traveling in search of it…

To know the rights of Hadeeth and the Muhadditheen is important
since this knowledge goes hand in hand with respect. In fact it is
dependant on this!

113

114

1. The Ilm of Hadeeth is the Meeraath (legacy) of Ambiyaa
hence it is necessary to respect this Ilm as well as its
scholars.
2. The Muhaddith must always hold on to truth and justice.

3. He must only narrate Saheeh Ahaadeeth and never Munkar
ones. 4. His niyyah must be correct.
4. He must keep the welfare of his students at heart.
5. He must not engage in frivolous matters, especially during
lessons.
6. Tawaadhu’ (humility) must be his garb.
7. He should always express his gratitude to Allaah for the
Ni’mat (boon) of Hadeeth.
8. He must be very particular in fulfilling the commands of
Allaah and abstaining from those things which are
prohibited.
9. He must save himself from all inward and outward evils e.g.
greed, avarice, jealousy, envy, hate, ostentation etc.

Page 116 of 121
Note: Special Kitaabs have been written dealing solely with the
Aadaab of Ilm and Ulamaa. The student should study a few of these.
In fact to keep them and read through them now and again is very
beneficial even for senior Ulamaa.

And to know Sababul Hadeeth (is among those important matters) and the Ustaads of Qaadhi Abu Ya’laa ibn Farraa have written
Kitaabs on this aspect, and the Muhadditheen have written on all of
these things and these are all pure Manqoolaat (narrations) and are
quite clear and not in need of definitions and examples and those
who need may refer to the detailed works and Allaah alone is the
granter of Taufeeq.

Asbaabul Wurood is the occasions when Rasoolullaah ρ said
something or when a certain incident took place (as Asbaabun
Nuzool in Qur’aan) – It is necessary for the student to know this
also. The Ustaad of Qaadhi Abu Ya’la Hanbali (380 – 485a.h.) Abu
Hafs Umar ibn Ibraaheem Akbari (387a.h.) has written a Kitaab on
this topic. Imaam Jalaaludden Suyooti began writing on it but was
unable to complete it. From the Mutaqaddimeen, Ibraaheem ibn
Muhammad Ibn Hamza Husaini Hanafi Dimashqi (1054 – 1120
a.h.) wrote a most valuable Kitaab on it in three volumes –
“AlBayaan wat Ta’reef fee Asbaab Wuroodil Hadeethish Shareef”
This Kitaab has since been published and is available in the Arab
countries.
The Ulamaa have written in detail regarding all the things
mentioned in the conclusion, May Allaah reward them all greatly.
And all the things mentioned above are Manqool (narrated) and are
quite clear and easy to understand aad are not in need of examples
and explanations. The details of these are in the Kitaabs of the
Muhadditheen and the students should study them – Wallaahul
Muwaffiq.
