Introduction
Praise be to Allah, who sent our Prophet Muḥammad as a mercy to
the whole universe. He sent down the Noble Qur’ān through him as
a light and guidance for those who are godfearing. He commanded
him to clarify what had been revealed to people so that they might
reﬂect. His words and actions made clear to them everything they
needed to know. He instructed those who were present with him to
convey his teaching to those who were not there.
Blessings and peace be upon him and upon his family and his good
and pure Companions who expended their property and their lives
to spread the dīn of Islam. By means of them Allah preserved His
Sharī‘a enabling it to survive through the passage of time down to
the present time. eir hearts were the vessels which contained and
preserved the ayats of the Clear Book and the Sunna of the Seal of
the Prophets and the Imām of the Messengers. en those who
followed them, and those who followed them in turn, undertook
this task. e people who wrote down and recorded this knowledge
appeared in the time of the third generation. e greatest of them
was the Imām of the Abode of the Hijra, the Imām of the Imāms,
Abū ‘Abdullāh Mālik ibn Anas al-Aṣbaḥī al-Madanī. He took it
upon himself to serve the Sharī‘a and to preserve the Prophetic
Sunna. He did this by relaying it from those notable Tābi‘ūn with
whose knowledge he was satisﬁed and whose words he thought
worthy of conveying and by his work he opened the way for all later
writers and cleared a path for the compilation of Islamic law. He
selected those transmitters who were reliable and rejected those who
were weak. His book, al-Muwaṭṭa’, was the greatest book written at
that time. It was the most precise in layout and the best of them in
its choice of chapters. e other books written at the same time as
his book have vanished but Allah had decreed that his book would
remain until this time and indeed until the ﬁrst of the two worlds
comes to an end, when Allah will inherit the earth and all those on
25

it. is has come about by the permission of the One Who created
the two worlds and the jinn and mankind.
I have been asked by some of our brothers, who desire to
disseminate knowledge and to renew the call of Islam, to write an
introduction to this edition of the Muwaṭṭa’, which is the ﬁrst
translation of the Muwaṭṭa’ in the English language. I have
complied with their request hoping for an abundant reward from
Allah since we are well aware of the importance of this book, its
blessings, the abundant knowledge to be found in it and its fame,
both past and present, among the books written on the science of
ḥadīth by the Imāms who are worthy of emulation.
We have divided this introduction into the following topics:

e lineage of Imām Mālik, his family, birth and autobiography
His full name is Mālik ibn Anas ibn Mālik ibn Abī ‘Āmir al-Aṣbaḥī
and he was related to Dhū Aṣbaḥ, a sub-tribe of Ḥimyar, one of the
Qahtani tribes who held sway over an immense kingdom during the
period of the Jāhiliyya. eir kingdom was known as the Tabābi‘a
(pl. of Tubba‘). Tubba‘ is mentioned in two places in the Noble
Qur’ān.
His father’s grandfather, Abū ‘Āmir, is considered by some to have
been one of the Companions and it is mentioned that he went on all
the raids with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬except Badr. However, Ibn
Ḥajar mentioned in the Iṣāba from adh-Dhahabī that he did not
ﬁnd anyone who mentioned him as being one of the Companions,
although he was certainly alive in the time of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬. As for
Mālik ibn Abī ‘Āmir, the grandfather of the Imām, he was one of
the great scholars of the Tābi‘ūn. He was one of those who assisted
in the writing out of the noble Muṣḥaf at the time of the Amīr alMu’minīn, ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān l.
He had four children: Anas, the father of the Imām, Abū Suhayl
whose name was Nāﬁ‘, ar-Rabī‘, and Uways the grandfather of
26

Ismā‘īl ibn Abī Uways and his brother, ‘Abd al-Ḥamīd. ese two
(Ismā‘īl and ‘Abd al-Ḥamīd) were among the students of Mālik and
among the transmitters of the Ṣaḥīḥ. e four brothers (i.e. Anas,
Mālik’s father, and his brothers) transmitted from their father,
Mālik ibn Abī ‘Āmir, and others, in turn, transmitted from them.
e most famous of them in knowledge and transmission was Abū
Suhayl. Imām Mālik related from him as did the compilers of the
Ṣaḥīḥ collections. Al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and others transmitted a lot
from Mālik ibn Abī ‘Āmir and from his son, Abū Suhayl.
From this it is evident that the Imām was a branch from a good tree
whose men were famous for transmitting and serving knowledge.
Part of the excellence of this family lies in the fact that it gave birth
to Imām Mālik. It is said that this took place in 90 A.H. although
there are other opinions. He died when he was 87 according to the
soundest report although it is also said that he was 90. Mālik, may
Allah have mercy on him, was tall and slightly corpulent. He was
bald, with a large head and well-shaped eyes, a ﬁne nose and a full
beard. Muṣ‘ab az-Zubayrī said, “Mālik was one of the most
handsome people in his face and the sweetest of them in eye, the
purest of them in whiteness and the most perfect of them in height
and the most excellent in body.” Another said, “Mālik was of
medium height.” e ﬁrst is better known.

His quest for knowledge
At the time when Mālik grew up, and during the time immediately
preceding him, Madīna al-Munawarra was ﬂourishing with the
great scholars who were the direct inheritors of the knowledge of
the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them. ey included
“the seven fuqahā’” of Madīna (or the ten) and their companions
who took from them. Mālik himself was always eager for knowledge
and devoted himself to the assemblies of eminent men of
knowledge. He drank and drank again from the sweet, quenching
springs of knowledge.

27

He was instructed in the learning and recitation of the Noble
Qur’ān by Imām Nāﬁ‘ ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī Nu‘aym, the
Imām of the reciters of Madīna and one of the “seven reciters”. Abū
‘Amr ad-Dānī, who included the biography of Imām Mālik in his
book Ṭabaqāt al-Qurrā’, considered him to be to be one of the
reciters. He mentioned that Imām al-Awzā‘ī related the Qur’ān
from Mālik, he being concerned with the meaning of its
commentary. In the Muwaṭṭa’, you will ﬁnd some of his
commentaries on certain ayats.
He occupied himself with those who knew ḥadīths, both in
transmission and knowledge, and was a master in ﬁqh, knowing
how to derive judgements and join statements together and how to
weigh one proof against another. Part of his good fortune was that
two of his shaykhs, Muḥammad ibn Shihāb az-Zuhrī and ‘Abdullāh
ibn Abī Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm al-Anṣārī, were
instrumental in the beginning of the process of recording the
ḥadīths.
Imām Mālik met an extraordinary number of men of knowledge
who related from the Companions or from the great Tābi‘ūn. He
did not attend the circle of everyone who sat teaching in the mosque
of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬or leaned against one of its pillars relating ḥadīth
to the people from the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬but used to take only
from those men that he saw possessed taqwā, scrupulousness, good
memory, knowledge and understanding, and who clearly knew that
they would be accountable for what they said on the Day of Rising.
Shu‘ba ibn al-Ḥajjāj, who was one of the great scholars of ḥadīth,
said that Mālik was most discriminating, saying about him that:
“He did not write down from everyone.”
Knowing, as we do, that Imām Mālik came from a family of
learning and grew up in Madīna al-Munawarra which was the
capital of knowledge at that time, especially the knowledge of
ḥadīths, and also knowing the strength of Mālik’s predisposition for
retention, understanding and taqwā and his perseverance and
28

steadfastness in the face of all the obstacles he met in the path of
knowledge, it is hardly surprising to discover that he graduated at a
very young age. Reliable transmitters relate that he sat to give fatwā
when he was seventeen years old. is was not from the impetuosity
of youth or because of love of appearance but only after seventy
Imāms had testiﬁed that he was worthy to give fatwā and teach.
Such people would only testify when it was absolutely correct to do
so. Indeed, the testimony of any two of them would have been
suﬃcient.

People’s praise of him and their testimony that he was the
greatest of the Imāms in knowledge
e notable scholars at the time of Mālik and those who came after
him all agree about his pre-eminent worth and consider him to be a
pillar of knowledge and one of its ﬁrm bulwarks, celebrated for his
taqwā, his retentive memory, his reliability in transmission, and his
ability in giving fatwās. He was well known for his turning towards
true knowledge and away from what did not concern him, and for
cutting himself oﬀ from the caliphs and amirs who would liberally
bestow money on those men of knowledge who attached themselves
to them. He had overwhelming respect for the ḥadīths of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, and this was considered enough by the
notable men of ḥadīth and fuqahā’ who related from him and used
his transmission as a proof, putting it ahead of the transmission of
many of his peers. ey followed him in declaring diﬀerent
transmitters reliable or unreliable.
ere is no disagreement on the fact that al-Layth, al-Awzā‘ī, the
two Sufyāns, Ibn al-Mubārak, Shu‘ba ibn al-Ḥajjāj, ‘Abd ar-Razzāq
and other great scholars like them transmitted from Mālik. Imām
ash-Shāﬁ‘ī was one of his most prominent pupils as was Imām
Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan, the companion of Abū Ḥanīfa. Qāḍī Abū
Yūsuf, who met and spoke with him, also related from him via an
intermediary. It is also true that Abū Ḥanīfa related from him as did
a group of his shaykhs, including Muḥammad ibn Shihāb az-Zuhrī,
29

Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān, Abū al-Aswad Muḥammad ibn
‘Abd ar-Raḥmān known as the ‘orphan of ‘Urwa’, Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd alAnṣārī, Ayyūb as-Sakhtiyānī and others. ere were none in their
time greater than these men. Some of them were fuqahā’ and others
were ḥadīth relaters. Most of them were both.
ose who came after them all related from Mālik except for those
who were prevented from doing so by circumstances. Why indeed
should they not relate from him? Was not the Imām someone who
combined justice, precision, examination, and criticism in his
evaluation of men and avoided transmission from the weak? ere is
only one man he related from who is considered weak. He was ‘Abd
al-Karīm ibn Abī al-Makhāriq al-Baṣrī, and this only happened
because he was not one of the people of Mālik’s own land and Mālik
was deceived by his scrupulousness and the way he performed hajj.
If you have any doubts about what we have said, then look in any of
the books of ḥadīths and you will ﬁnd the name of Mālik constantly
repeated by the tongues and pens of the transmitters. Enough for us
is the frequent repetition of his name in the Ṣaḥīḥ volumes of alBukhārī and Muslim. e Kitāb al-Umm of Imām ash-Shāﬁ‘ī and
his Kitāb ar-Risāla both begin with the words, “Mālik reported to
us.” When the Musnad of ash-Shāﬁ‘ī was compiled, it also began
with the same words.
We ﬁnd that Ḥāﬁẓ Abū Bakr al-Bayhaqī began his great Sunan with
the ḥadīth “Its water is pure” which is from the transmission of ashShāﬁ‘ī from Mālik and from the transmission of Abū Dāwūd from
Mālik. He mentioned that ash-Shāﬁ‘ī said, “ere is someone in the
isnād whom I do not know.” en al-Bayhaqī said at the end of it,
“However, that which establishes the soundness of its isnād was the
reliability Mālik gave it in the Muwaṭṭa’.” ese words indicate the
position of Mālik and that the people of his time and those after
them, who were not partisan, acknowledged his pre-eminence in the
preservation of ḥadīth, in his ability to distinguish the sound from

30

the weak, and in his knowledge of the science of men and their
states, whether they were reliable or unreliable.
ose early Imāms were not content to remain silent about him, but
spoke out using their tongues and their pens, clearly stating his
eminence and the extent of his fame. In Iṣ‘āf al-mubaṭṭa bi-rijāl alMuwaṭṭa’, Jalāl ad-Dīn as-Suyūṭī said that Bishr ibn ‘Umar azZahrānī said that he asked Mālik about a man and he said, “Do you
see him in my books?” He replied, “No.” Mālik said, “If he had been
reliable, you would have seen him in my books.” Ibn al-Madīnī said,
“I never knew Mālik to reject a man unless there was something
wrong about his ḥadīths.” Ibn al-Madīnī also said, “When Mālik
brings you a ḥadīth from someone from Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyib, I
prefer that to Sufyān from someone from Ibrāhīm. Mālik only
relates from people who are reliable.” Yaḥyā ibn Ma‘īn said, “All of
those from whom Mālik ibn Anas relates are reliable except for
‘Abd al-Karīm al-Baṣrī Abū Umayya.”
Aḥmad ibn Ṣāliḥ said, “I do not know of anyone who was more
careful in his selection of men and scholars than Mālik. I do not
know of anyone who has related anything wrong about anyone
among those he chose. He related from people none of whom are
rejected.” An-Nasā’ī said, “e trustees of Allah over the knowledge
of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬were Shu‘ba ibn al-Ḥajjāj, Mālik ibn
Anas and Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd al-Qaṭṭān.” He said, “Ath-awrī was an
Imām, but he related from weak men. It was the same with Ibn alMubārak.” en he indicated the pre-eminence of Mālik over
Shu‘ba and Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd al-Qaṭṭān. He said, “ere are none
among the Tābi‘ūn trusted in ḥadīths more than these three, and
none who had fewer weak transmissions.”
Ismā‘īl ibn Abī Uways said, “I heard my uncle, Mālik, say, ‘is
knowledge is a dīn, so look to those from whom you take your dīn. I
met seventy men who said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said by
these pillars...” and I did not take anything from them. Yet if any
one of them were to be trusted with the treasury, he would have
31

been trustworthy. is is because they were not men of this
business. But when Ibn Shihāb came to us, we crowded around his
door. Yaḥyā ibn Ma‘īn said from Sufyān ibn ‘Uyayna, “Who are we
in comparison to Mālik? We merely follow in the tracks of Mālik.
We looked to see if Mālik took from a shaykh. If not we left him.”
Ashhab said that Mālik was asked, “Should one take from someone
who does not memorise, but is reliable and accurate in writing? Can
ḥadīths be taken from such a man?” Mālik replied, “I fear that he
might add to his books at night.” Al-Athrim said, “I asked Aḥmad
ibn Ḥanbal about ‘Amr ibn Abī ‘Amr, the client of al-Muṭṭalib, and
he said, ‘His transmission is excellent in my opinion. Mālik related
from him.’” Abū Sa‘īd ibn al-A‘rābī said, “If Mālik related from a
man, Yaḥyā ibn Ma‘īn declared him reliable. More than one person
was asked and said, ‘He is reliable. Mālik related from him.’”
Qarād Abū Nūḥ said, “Mālik mentioned something and was asked,
‘Who related it to you?’ He said. ‘We did not use to sit with fools.’”
‘Abdullāh ibn Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal said, “I heard my father
mentioning this and he said, ‘ere is no statement in the world
more noble than this regarding the virtues of scholars - Mālik ibn
Anas mentioned that he did not sit with fools. is statement is not
valid from anyone else except Mālik.’
In Tadhkira al-Ḥuﬀāẓ, adh-Dhahabī mentioned some of people’s
praise of him, including the famous statement of ash-Shāﬁ‘ī,
“When the ‘ulamā’ are mentioned, Mālik is the star.” Aḥmad ibn alKhalīl said that he heard Isḥāq ibn Ibrāhīm (i.e. Ibn Rahwayh) say,
“When ath-awrī, Mālik and al-Awzā‘ī agree on a matter, it is
sunna, even if there is no text on it.”
After mentioning much of the praise of the people of knowledge for
him, adh-Dhahabī said, “I put Mālik’s biography on its own in a
section in my Tārīkh al-Kabīr. It is agreed that Mālik had virtues
which are not known to have been combined in anyone else. e
ﬁrst of them was the length of his life and extent of his
transmission. e second was his piercing mind. e third was the
32

agreement of the Imāms that he is a proof, sound in transmission.
e fourth is that they agree on his dīn, justice and following of the
sunna. e ﬁfth is his pre-eminence in ﬁqh, fatwā and the
soundness of his foundations.”
In Taqrīb at-Tahdhīb, Ibn Ḥajar says, “Mālik ibn Anas ibn Mālik
ibn Abī ‘Āmir al-Aṣbaḥī, Abū ‘Abdullāh, al-Madanī, the faqīh, the
Imām of the Abode of the Hijra, the chief of those who have taqwā
and the greatest of those who are conﬁrmed, of whom al-Bukhārī
said, ‘e soundest isnāds of all are those of Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from
Ibn ‘Umar.’”
is is just a brief collection of a few of the things that have been
said about him by scholars who do not follow the school of Mālik.
eir words in no way disagree with anything that has been written
by the Mālikī scholars who follow him. e reader will be able to
ﬁnd a lot of what they have said in the books of Abū ‘Umar ibn
‘Abd al-Barr, the Tartīb al-Madārik of Qāḍī Abū al-Faḍl ‘Iyāḍ, and
ad-Dībāj al-Mudhahhab by Burhān ad-Dīn ibn Farḥūn, and other
books of earlier and later writers.
Among the Mālikīs and others Imām Mālik is known as the Imām
of the Imāms. It is easy to see why this is so. We know that those
Imāms whose schools, fatwās and transmissions are followed were
his students, either directly or via an intermediary. Imām ash-Shāﬁ‘ī
was one of Imām Mālik’s most famous students and Imām Aḥmad
was one of the most famous students of ash-Shāﬁ‘ī. Muḥammad ibn
al-Ḥasan was one of the transmitters of the Muwaṭṭa’. Abū Yūsuf
also related it from Mālik via an intermediary. One scholar
conﬁrmed that Imām Abū Ḥanīfa also related from him, and no
objection was made to him for stating that. Some shaykhs like Ibn
Shihāb and ar-Rabī‘a related from Mālik as we have already
mentioned. We also mentioned that al-Layth, al-Awzā‘ī, the two
Sufyāns and Ibn al-Mubārak related from him, and there is no
disagreement about that. Scholars of ḥadīths who are famous for
writing in that ﬁeld, or from whom others have transmitted,
33

transmitted from him. We say that today there is no scholar of the
Islamic Sharī‘a who is not a student of Mālik. at is because, ﬁrst
of all, it is not valid to count someone as a scholar of the Sharī‘a if
he is ignorant of the Muwaṭṭa’, the Six Books, the Musnad of
Aḥmad and the rest of the books which are consulted in ḥadīths. All
of those who relate these books or some of them must relate from
Mālik. erefore they must respect this Imām from whom they
relate and acknowledge his position and ask for mercy on him.
One of the extraordinary things about the people who came to
Mālik for transmission is that there was not a single small region
subject to the rule of Islam in his time but that a group of their
noble sons set out to visit him. e number of those whose name
was Muḥammad who related from him is more than a hundred. e
number of those called ‘Abdullāh is about sixty, of those called
Yaḥyā about forty, and of those called Sa‘īd more than twenty. If you
were to imagine his circle of study, you would ﬁnd Andalusians,
Khorasanis, Syrians, Moroccans, Egyptians, Iraqis, Yemenis, and
others all sitting in a circle around him with their diﬀerent
languages, colours, and clothing. It must have been an amazing
sight. We do not believe that such a group has ever been gathered
together at the feet of a scholar before or after him, in Madīna or
elsewhere.

e shaykhs from whom he transmitted
It is known that Imām Mālik grew up in Madīna al-Munawwara
and that those who sought knowledge travelled there from all the
regions of Islam because Madīna had an unrivalled number of
scholars compared with the rest of the Muslim world. In Madīna
Mālik met all the great men who had a major part in the
transmission of ḥadīths and the sayings of the Companions and the
great Tābi‘ūn. He found such a wealth of knowledge there that he
did not need to travel anywhere else. He related from nine hundred
shaykhs or more and with his own hand wrote down a hundred
thousand ḥadīths. His book, the Muwaṭṭa’, which we are discussing,
34

contains eighty-four men of the Tābi‘ūn, all of whom were people of
Madīna except for six. ese six were Abū az-Zubayr from Makka,
Ḥamīd aṭ-Ṭawīl and Ayyūb as-Sakhtiyānī from Basra, ‘Aṭā’ ibn Abī
Muslim from Khorasan, ‘Abd al-Karīm al-Jazarī from Jazira
(Mesopotamia) in northern Iraq, and Ibrāhīm ibn Abī ‘Abla from
Syria. Mālik is famous for the fact that he did not transmit from a
number of scholars whom he met, even though they were people of
dīn and correct action, because he thought that they did not
transmit properly.
Al-Ghāﬁqī said that the number of his shaykhs whom he named
(i.e. in the Muwaṭṭa’) was ninety-ﬁve.

e transmitters who transmitted from him
In the introduction to Tanwīr al-Ḥawālik, as-Suyūṭī says that so
many people related from him that no other Imām is known to have
had a transmission like his. He says that Abū Bakr al-Khaṭīb alBaghdadī devoted a book to those who transmitted from Mālik and
it included 993 men. Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ mentioned that he wrote a book on
those who transmitted from Mālik in which he enumerated over
1300 men. As-Suyūṭī said that he had enumerated the names of all
of them in his Great Commentary. e transmitters of al-Muwaṭṭa’
alone are of a number which it is diﬃcult to count.
Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ mentioned that the number of transmissions which he
read or came across in the transmissions of his shaykhs reached
twenty, and some of them mention thirty. Another thing that
indicates the great number of the transmitters of the Muwaṭṭa’ is
that Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal said, “I heard the Muwaṭṭa’ from about ten
of the companions of Mālik who had mentioned it but I revised it
with ash-Shāﬁ‘ī because I found him to be the most correct of
them.” Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥabīb-Allāh ibn Māyābā ash-Shinqīṭī
said in Iḍā’a al-Ḥālik that Ibn Nāṣir ad-Dīn ad-Dimashqī wrote a
book about the transmitters of the Muwaṭṭa’ and he mentioned that
there were seventy-nine. Among those who transmitted the
Muwaṭṭa’ from Mālik were his son, Yaḥyā, and his daughter, Fāṭima.

35

e position of the Muwaṭṭa’ and people’s concern for it
In the introduction to Tanwīr al-Ḥawālik, as-Suyūṭī said that ashShāﬁ‘ī said, “After the Book of Allah, there is no book on the face of
the earth sounder than the book of Mālik.” In another statement he
said, “No book has been placed on the earth closer to the Qur’ān
than the book of Mālik.” In a third he said, “After the Book of
Allah, there is no book more useful than the Muwaṭṭa’.” ‘Alā’ adDīn Maghlaṭāy al-Ḥanafī said, “e ﬁrst person to compile the
ṣaḥīḥ was Mālik.”
Ibn Ḥajar said, “e book of Mālik is sound by all the criteria that
are demanded as proofs in the mursal, munqaṭi‘ and other types of
transmission.” en as-Suyūṭī followed what Ibn Ḥajar said here
and said, “e mursal ḥadīths in it are a proof with him (ash-Shāﬁ‘ī)
as well because the mursal is a proof with us when it is properly
supported. Every mursal report in the Muwaṭṭa’ has one or more
supports as will be made clear in this commentary (i.e. Tanwīr alḤawālik). It is absolutely correct to say that the Muwaṭṭa’ is sound
(ṣaḥīḥ) without exception.”
Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr collected together all the mursal, munqaṭi‘ and
mu‘ḍal ḥadīths in the Muwaṭṭa’ and said that the total number of
ḥadīths in the Muwaṭṭa’ which do not have an isnād are sixty-one.
He stated that he found the isnāds of all of them in other sources
with the exception of four ḥadīths. e erudite scholar of ḥadīth,
Shaykh Muḥammad Ḥabīb-Allāh ibn Māyābā ash-Shinqīṭī says in
Iḍā’a al-Ḥālik that he had found witnesses for these four ḥadīths and
he then mentioned these witnesses. He said, “Some of the people of
knowledge made these isnāds complete.” He mentioned from Ibn
‘Abd al-Barr that there are no munkar ḥadīths in the Muwaṭṭa’ nor
anything fundamentally refuted. In Dalīl as-Sālik in the margin of
Iḍā’a al-Ḥālik he mentioned that Ibn Ḥajar retracted what he had
previously said which was what had been followed by as-Suyūṭī.
From this it is clear that everything in the Muwaṭṭa’ has an isnād.
e people of knowledge rely on the ḥadīths in it and transmit and
36

record them in their books, including al-Bukhārī and Muslim who
transmitted most of its ḥadīths and included them in their Ṣaḥīḥ
collections. e rest of the authors of the six books did the same as
did the Imām of the ḥadīth scholars, Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal, and
others.
It should be pointed out that the ḥadīths of Mālik are not conﬁned
to those he included in the Muwaṭṭa’. is is clearly shown by the
ḥadīths we ﬁnd transmitted from Mālik in the two Ṣaḥīḥ volumes
which are not found in the Muwaṭṭa’. ere is a ḥadīth which alBukhārī relates in the chapter on the description of the Garden:
“e people there look at the people of the chambers from above
them.” ere is a second ḥadīth related by Mālik commenting on
Surat al-Muṭaﬀafīn (83) where the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ ‘e Day
when people stand before the Lord of the Worlds’ until one of them
disappears immersed in his sweat up to his ears.” ere is a third
ḥadīth related by Muslim in the chapter forbidding ṣadaqa to the
family of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬which he related from ‘Abdullāh ibn
Muḥammad ibn Asmā’ aḍ-Ḍaba‘ī from his uncle, Juwayriya ibn
Asmā’, from Mālik.
ere are two areas which particularly interest people regarding the
Muwaṭṭa’. One of them is its transmission and the other is its
commentary and the discussion about its transmitters and the
diﬀerent expressions they use and so forth. As for interest in its
transmitters, we have already shown how the seekers of knowledge
in Mālik’s time came from East, West, South and North out of the
desire to sit in his circle and take from him. Many of this group
related the Muwaṭṭa’ from him and preserved it in their hearts or in
writing. e men of the generation after their generation were also
concerned with it.
We have enough evidence for what we say in the fact that Imām
Aḥmad ibn Ḥanbal related it ﬁrst from ten men and then ﬁnally
from Imām ash-Shāﬁ‘ī. Similarly ash-Shāﬁ‘ī ﬁrst learned it in
Makka and then went to Madīna to Mālik and took it directly from
37

him. at is also what Yaḥyā ibn Yaḥyā al-Andalusī did – he ﬁrst
learned it in his own country from Ziyād ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān
Shabṭūn and then travelled from Andalusia to Madīna and read it
directly with Mālik in the year in which Imām Mālik died, may
Allah have mercy on him.
As for interest in its commentary, discussion about its transmitters
and whether the diﬀerent versions are shorter or longer, and
commentary on what is gharib in it and that sort of thing, people
evince more interest in writing about these matters in the case of the
Muwaṭṭa’ than they do for any other book of ḥadīth. A great
number of people have written about these things and some of them
have composed several books. For instance, Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr wrote
three books: at-Tamhīd, al-Istidhkār and at-Tajrīd which is also
called “at-Taqaṣṣī”. Qāḍī Abū al-Walīd al-Bājī wrote three
commentaries called al-Istīfā’, al-Muntaqā, and al-Īmā’. He wrote a
fourth book on the diﬀerent versions of the Muwaṭṭa’. Jalāl ad-Dīn
as-Suyūṭī wrote two commentaries on it. One of them, called Kashf
al-Mughaṭṭā, is voluminous, and the other is a summary called
Tanwīr al-Ḥawālik. He wrote a third book called Iṣ‘āf al-Mubaṭṭa’
bi-rijāl al-Muwaṭṭa’.
e most famous transmission of the Muwaṭṭa’ is that of Yaḥyā ibn
Yaḥyā al-Laythī al-Andalusī so that when the name the Muwaṭṭa’ is
used, it is this transmission that is referred to. ere are about a
hundred commentaries on it. is is what Shaykh Muḥammad
Ḥabīb-Allāh ibn Māyābā ash-Shinqīṭī was indicating in the Dalīl
as-Sālik when he said:
e most famous Muwaṭṭa’
If the truth be known
Is that of Imām Yaḥyā al-Laythī.
Who else’s can be compared with his?
He also said:
38

It is the one on which the critics comment and in
whose lustre the slaves ﬁnd beneﬁt.
ere are about a hundred commentaries on it,
all of them about what it contains.
Another version of the Muwaṭṭa’ worthy of mention is that of Imām
Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan ash-Shaybānī which has great distinction.
It includes the transmission of many traditions intended to support
his madhhab and the madhhab of his Imām, Abū Ḥanīfa.
Sometimes he mentions that Abū Ḥanīfa agrees with Mālik
regarding the matter under discussion.
It appears that the Andalusians had a great deal of interest in the
Muwaṭṭa’ as anyone will know who has studied the names of the
scholars who made commentaries on it or spoke about the people in
it and its diﬀerent versions or wrote on its gharīb ḥadīths.
It should also be noted that those who were interested in the
Muwaṭṭa’ were not only Mālikīs or people from one particular
region. ey were from diﬀerent groups and schools and from all
parts of the Muslim world.

Clariﬁcation of the meaning of “Muwaṭṭa’”, its excellent layout
and ﬁne style
“Muwaṭṭa’” is a passive participle from the verb “tawṭi’a”. One says
that the thing is smoothed (waṭṭa’a) and “I prepared the thing for
you” and “e bed is laid out” and “e seat is made comfortable for
you”. Ibn Manẓūr said in al-Lisān, “In the ḥadīth: ‘Shall I tell you of
the one among you I love the most and who will sit closest to me on
the Day of Rising? – ose who are easy-going (muwaṭṭa’ al-aknāf)
who are friendly and bring people together.’” Ibn al-Athīr said,
“is comes from tawṭi’a which means to smooth and make lower.
us Muwaṭṭa’ means the clear book which smooths the way and is
not diﬃcult for the seeker of knowledge to grasp. It is also related
that Mālik gave his book this title because he read it to a group of
39

the people of knowledge and they agreed with him about it (wāṭa’a).
In this case the name would be derived from muwāṭa’a which means
agreement. However, the ﬁrst meaning is more likely because it is
supported by the rules of derivation although both of them apply
since the way is prepared and smoothed by it and people agree about
it and admire it.
If you look at the Muwaṭṭa’ in an unbiased way, you will ﬁnd that it
prepares and smooths the way and is easy to grasp, even though it is
one of the oldest books now in our possession. No earlier book from
the people of knowledge is known. Its author made it an example to
be imitated, particularly in the way in which it is arranged.
We ﬁnd that Mālik begins with the chapters on the acts of worship,
which are the pillars of Islam. He put the prayer ﬁrst, it being the
greatest of the pillars. Since the prayer only becomes obligatory
when its time comes, he began by talking about the times of prayer.
en he spoke about purity in all its forms because puriﬁcation is
obligatory after the time for prayer has come. en he spoke about
what it is obligatory to do in the prayer and what is not obligatory
and things that can happen to people in the prayer. en he spoke
about zakāt and so on until he had covered all the acts of worship.
en he spoke about the rest of the matters of ﬁqh and divided each
chapter into small sections so as to make it easier to grasp. He
ﬁnished the book with a chapter called “General Matters” which
contains various things which did not ﬁt under the other headings,
and since it was not possible to devote a whole chapter to each of
them and he did not want to go on at length, he combined them
and called it “General Matters”. As Ibn al-‘Arabī says, other authors
found in this arrangement a new way of organising their material.
What he did in the book as a whole he also did in certain chapters.
For instance at the end of the chapter on prayer, he has a section
entitled “Prayer in General”. He also has a section on “Funerals in
General,” “Fasting in General,” “General chapter on what is not
permitted of marriage,” and “General chapter on sales,” etc. is
40

shows the excellence of the way he arranged the book and the
precision of the system he used. is is so much the case that if one
of us today, in this age of systems, wanted to organise it, it would be
very diﬃcult to come up with a better arrangement than the one it
already has.
If the reader looks at the Muwaṭṭa’ with respect to its language, he
will ﬁnd that its language shows that the author was a pure Arab.
His language has both force and simplicity. Its terms are neither odd
nor hackneyed. His style is free of oversimpliﬁcation, unnecessary
complexity or triteness. Despite its length, the book does not
contain any linguistic or grammatical errors nor any of the faults
which the scholars of rhetoric warn against.
Consequently we do not ﬁnd that any of those who have made
commentaries on it or spoken about it, despite their great number
and their diﬀerent times, places and backgrounds, directed any
criticism at it on these grounds, neither in respect of what the Imām
himself wrote nor in respect of the transmissions of Prophetic
ḥadīths and other traditions ascribed to the Companions and the
Tābi‘ūn. By that we mean that there is no criticism at all that cannot
easily be answered. It is always possible for criticism to be made by
people whose understanding is inadequate and who lack suﬃcient
knowledge. “How many there are who ﬁnd fault with a sound
statement while their trouble is faulty understanding.”
e noble reader should also be aware of the fact that Imām Mālik
has other works than the Muwaṭṭa’ even though they are not as
famous.
ese works are:
1. A letter on Qadar and refutation of the Qadariyya. He wrote it to
‘Abdullāh ibn Wahb, one of his eminent students.
2. A book on the stars and reckoning the passage of time and the
stages of the moon.
41

3. A letter on judgements which he wrote to some judges.
4. A letter on fatwā which was addressed to Abū Ghassān
Muḥammad ibn Muṭarrif al-Laythī, one of his great students.
5. A letter on the ijmā‘ of the people of Madīna which he sent to
Imām al-Layth ibn Sa‘d.
6. A book on the tafsīr of rare words in the Qur’ān.
7. A letter on manners and admonitions which he sent to Hārūn arRashīd which is not acknowledged by a group of notable Mālikīs.
8. A book called Kitāb as-Sirr.
is introduction is only a drop in the ocean. It has not covered
everything by any means but I hope it has mentioned a few salient
points.
Allah is the One we ask for help and on Whom we rely. May Allah
bless our master Muḥammad and his family and Companions and
grant them peace abundantly.

1. e Times of Prayer
1.1 e times of prayer
1 He said, “Yaḥyā ibn Yaḥyā al-Laythī related to me from Mālik ibn

Anas from Ibn Shihāb that one day ‘Umar ibn ʿAbd al-‘Azīz
delayed the prayer. ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr went to him and told him
that al-Mughīra ibn Shu‘ba had delayed the prayer one day while he
was in Kūfa and Abū Mas‘ūd al-Anṣārī had gone to him and asked,
‘What is this, Mughīra? Do you not know that the angel Jibrīl came
down and prayed and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed. en he
prayed again, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed. en he
prayed again, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed. en he
prayed again, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed. en he
prayed again, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed. en he said,
“is is what I was ordered to do.”’”
‘Umar ibn ʿAbd al-‘Azīz said, “Be sure of what you relate, ‘Urwa.
Was it deﬁnitely Jibrīl who established the times of the prayers for
the Messenger of Allah?”
‘Urwa replied, “at is how it was related to Bashīr ibn Abī Mas‘ūd
al-Anṣārī by his father.”
2 ‘Urwa said, “‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬related to me that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray ‘Aṣr while the sunlight was

pouring into her room, before the sun itself had become visible (i.e.
because it was still high in the sky).”

3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār said, “A man came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and

asked him about the time of the Ṣubḥ prayer. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did not answer him, but in the morning he prayed Ṣubḥ at
ﬁrst light. e following morning he prayed Ṣubḥ when it was much
lighter, and then asked, ‘Where is the man who was asking about
43

the time of the prayer?’ e man replied, ‘Here I am, Messenger of
Allah.’ He said, ‘e time is between these two.’”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Amra
bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray Ṣubḥ and then the women

would leave wrapped in their garments while they could not yet be
recognised in the darkness.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār and from Busr ibn Sa‘īd and from al-A‘raj – all of whom
related it to him from Abū Hurayra – that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever manages to perform a rak‘a of Ṣubḥ before the
sun has risen has done Ṣubḥ within the time, and whoever manages
to perform a rak‘a of ‘Aṣr before the sun has set has done ‘Aṣr within
the time.”
6 Yaḥyā

related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘, the mawlā of
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar, that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb wrote to his
governors, saying, “e most important of your aﬀairs in my view is
the prayer. Whoever protects it and observes it carefully is
protecting his dīn, while whoever is negligent about it will be even
more negligent about other things.”
en he added, “Pray Ẓuhr any time from when the afternoon shade
is the length of your forearm until the length of your shadow
matches your height. Pray ‘Aṣr when the sun is still pure white, so
that a rider can travel two or three farsakhs before the sun sets. Pray
Maghrib when the sun has set. Pray ‘Ishā’ any time after the redness
in the western sky has disappeared up until a third of the night has
passed – and a person who sleeps, may he have no rest; a person
who sleeps, may he have no rest; a person who sleeps, may he have
no rest. Pray Ṣubḥ when all the stars are visible and mixed together
in the sky.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from his uncle Abū Suhayl from

his father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb wrote to Abū Mūsā saying that
44

he should pray Ẓuhr when the sun had started to decline, ‘Aṣr when
the sun was still pure white before it was tinged with any yellowness,
Maghrib when the sun had set, and to delay ‘Ishā’ as long as he did
not sleep, and to pray Ṣubḥ when the stars were all visible and mixed
together in the sky, reciting in it two long sūras from the Mufaṣṣal.
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his

father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb wrote to Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī that
he should pray ‘Aṣr when the sun was still pure white so that a man
could ride three farsakhs (before Maghrib) and that he should pray
‘Ishā’ during the ﬁrst third of the night, or, if he delayed it, then up
until the middle of the night, and he warned him not to be
forgetful.
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn Ziyād that

ʿAbdullāh ibn Rāﬁ‘, the mawlā of Umm Salama, the wife of the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, asked Abū Hurayra about the times of the prayers. Abū
Hurayra said, “I will tell you. Pray Ẓuhr when the length of your
shadow matches your height, ‘Aṣr when your shadow is twice your
height, Maghrib when the sun has set, ‘Ishā’ in the ﬁrst third of the
night, and Ṣubḥ in the very ﬁrst light of dawn,” i.e. when the dawn
has deﬁnitely come.
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ishāq ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn

Abī Ṭalḥa that Anas ibn Mālik said, “We used to pray the ‘Aṣr
prayer, and then if one of us went out to the Banū ‘Amr ibn ‘Awf, we
would ﬁnd them praying ‘Aṣr.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Anas ibn

Mālik said, “We used to pray ‘Aṣr and then it was still possible for
one of us to go to Qubā’ and arrive there while the sun was still
high.”
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad said, “None of the
Companions that I met prayed Ẓuhr until well after noon,” (i.e.
until when the sun had lost it ﬁerceness).



45

1.2 e time of the jumu‘a prayer
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from his uncle Abū Suhayl ibn

Mālik that his father said, “I used to see a carpet belonging to ‘Āqil
ibn Abī Ṭālib spread out on the day of jumu‘a up to the west wall of
the mosque. When the shadow of the wall covered the whole carpet,
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb would come out and pray the jumu‘a prayer.”
Mālik, Abū Suhayl’s father, added, “We would then return after the
jumu‘a prayer and take our midday sleep”.
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Amr ibn Yaḥyā ibn Yaḥyā

al-Māzinī from Ibn Abī Salīt that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān prayed jumu‘a
in Madīna and ‘Aṣr at Malal. Mālik commented, “at was due to
praying jumu‘a just past midday and then travelling fast.”

1.3 Whoever catches a rak‘a of the ṣalāh
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū

Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever catches a rak‘a of the prayer has caught
the prayer.”
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to say, “If you have missed rukū‘, you
have missed the sajda.”
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar and Zayd ibn ābit used to say, “Whoever catches the
rukū‘ has caught the sajda.”

18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Abū

Hurayra used to say, “Whoever catches the rukū‘ has caught the
sajda and whoever misses the recitation of the Umm al-Qur’ān has
missed much good.”

1.4 Dulūk ash-shams and ghasaq al-layl
46

ʿ

19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Dulūk ash-Shams begins from when the sun
passes the meridian.”
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Dā’ūd ibn al-Ḥusayn said

that someone had told him that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās used to say,
“Dulūk ash-Shams begins from when the sun passes the meridian.
Ghasaq al-layl is the gathering of the night and its darkness.”

1.5 e times of prayer in general
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If someone misses the

‘Aṣr prayer it is as if he has been deprived of his family and all his
wealth.”

22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that once

‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb left after performing the ‘Aṣr prayer and met a
man who had not been present for ‘Aṣr. ‘Umar asked him what had
kept him from the ‘Aṣr prayer, and even though the man gave a
good reason, ‘Umar said, “You have given yourself short measure.”
Yaḥyā added that Mālik commented, “It is said that everything has a
short measure and a full measure.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd used to say,

“Even if someone manages to pray before the time of the prayer has
passed, the time that has passed him by is more important – or
better – than his family and wealth.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “If the time for a prayer comes and a
traveller delays the prayer through neglect or forgetfulness until he
reaches his family, he should do that prayer in full if he arrives
within the time. But if he arrives after the time has passed, he
should do the travelling prayer – that way he only repays what he
owes.”

47

Mālik said, “is is what I have found the people and men of
knowledge in our land doing.”
Mālik explained that shafaq is the redness in the sky after the sun
has set and said, “When the redness has gone then the ‘Ishā’ prayer
is due and you have left the time of Maghrib.”
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that once ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar fainted and lost consciousness and he did not make up
the prayer.
Mālik commented, “We consider that that was because, and Allah
knows best, the time had passed. Someone who recovers within the
time still has to pray.”

1.6 Sleeping through the prayer
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬travelled by night on

the way back from Khaybar. Towards the end of the night he
stopped for a rest and told Bilāl, “Keep watch for the Ṣubḥ prayer.”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and his companions slept. Bilāl stayed
on watch for as long as was decreed for him and then he leant
against his riding camel facing the direction of the dawn and sleep
overcame him and neither he nor the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬nor any
of the party woke up until the sun’s rays struck them. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was alarmed. Bilāl said, “Messenger of Allah!
e One who took your soul was the One who took my soul.” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Move on.” So they roused their
mounts and rode on a short distance. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
ordered Bilāl to give the iqāma for the prayer and then led them in
the Ṣubḥ prayer. When he ﬁnished the prayer he said, “A person
who forgets a prayer should pray it when he remembers. Allah the
Blessed and Exalted says in His book, ‘Establish the prayer to
remember Me.’ (20:14)”

48

26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Zayd ibn Aslam said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stopped for a rest one night on the road to

Makka and appointed Bilāl to wake them up for the prayer. Bilāl
slept and everyone else slept and none of them woke up until the
sun had risen. When they did wake up they were all alarmed. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered them to ride out of the valley, saying
that there was a shayṭān in it. So they rode out of the valley and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered them to dismount and do wuḍū’ and
he told Bilāl either to call the prayer or to give the iqāma. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬then led them in prayer. Noticing their
uneasiness, he went to them and said, ‘O people! Allah seized our
spirits (arwāḥ) and if He had wished He would have returned them
to us at a time other than this. So if you sleep through the time for a
prayer or forget it and then are anxious about it, pray it as if you
were praying it in its time.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬turned to
Abū Bakr and said, ‘Shayṭān came to Bilāl when he was standing in
prayer and made him lie down and lulled him to sleep like a small
boy.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬then called Bilāl and told him the
same as he had told Abū Bakr. Abū Bakr declared. ‘I bear witness
that you are the Messenger of Allah.’”

1.7 Not doing the prayer at the hottest hour of the day
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Scorching heat

comes from the blast of Jahannam. So when the heat is ﬁerce, delay
the prayer until it gets cooler.” He added in explanation, “e Fire
complained to its Lord and said, ‘My Lord, part of me has eaten
another part,’ so He allowed it two breaths in every year, a breath in
winter and a breath in summer.”
28 Mālik related to us from ʿAbdullāh ibn Yazīd, the mawlā of al-

Aswad ibn Sufyān, from Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān from
Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn awbān from Abū Hurayra
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When the heat is ﬁerce, delay

49

the prayer until it gets cooler, for scorching heat comes from the
blast of Jahannam.”
He added, “e Fire complained to its Lord, so He allowed it two
breaths in each year, a breath in the winter and a breath in summer.”
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“When the heat is ﬁerce, wait until it gets cooler before you do the
prayer, for scorching heat comes from the blast of Jahannam.”

1.8 Not entering the mosque smelling of garlic and not covering
the mouth in prayer
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Anyone who eats

this plant should not come near our mosques. e smell of the garlic
will oﬀend us.”

31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Mujabbar that he used to see Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh pull the cloth
away ﬁercely from the mouth of any man he saw covering his mouth
while praying.

2. Book of Purity
2.1 How to perform wuḍū’
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Amr ibn Yaḥyā al-Māzinī

that his father once asked ʿAbdullāh ibn Zayd ibn ‘Āṣim, the
grandfather of ‘Amr ibn Yaḥyā al-Māzinī and one of the
companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “Can you show me how
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to perform wuḍū’?” ʿAbdullāh ibn
Zayd ibn ‘Āṣim replied, “Yes,” and asked for water to do wuḍū’. He
poured some water on to his hand and washed his hands twice and
then rinsed his mouth and snuﬀed water up his nose and blew it out
twice. en he washed his face three times and both of his arms up
to the elbows twice. He then wiped his head with both hands,
taking his hands from his forehead to the nape of his neck and then
bringing them back to where he had begun. en he washed his
feet.
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū’z-Zinād from al-A‘raj
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When you

do wuḍū’, snuﬀ water into your nose and blow it out, and if you use
stones to clean your private parts use an odd number.”

3 Yaḥyā related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Abū Idrīs al-Khawlānī
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e

person doing wuḍū’ should snuﬀ water up his nose and blow it out
again, and if you use stones to clean your private parts use an odd
number.”
4 Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say that there was no harm in

washing the mouth and cleaning the nose using only one handful of
water.

5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān ibn Abī Bakr was visiting ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet
51

‫ﷺ‬, on the day that Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ died, and he asked for

some water to do wuḍū’. ‘A’isha said to him, “ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān!
Perform your wuḍū’ fully, for I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say,
‘Woe to the heels in the ﬁre!’”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Muḥammad ibn

Ṭalḥa from ‘Uthmān ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that his father related to
him that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to wash what
was beneath his waist-wrapper with water.
7 Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked what a man should do if, when he

did wuḍū’, he forgot and washed his face before he had rinsed his
mouth, or washed his forearms before he had washed his face. He
said, “If someone washes his face before rinsing his mouth, he
should rinse his mouth and not wash his face again. If someone
washes his forearms before his face, however, he should wash his
forearms again so that he has washed them after his face. is is if
he is still near the place (of wuḍū’).”
8 Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked about what a man should do if he

does not remember that he has not rinsed his mouth and nose until
after he has prayed. He said, “He does not have to repeat the prayer,
but he should rinse his mouth and nose if he wishes to do any more
prayers after that.”

2.2 Wuḍū’ for praying after sleep
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū’z-Zinād from al-A‘raj
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When one

of you wakes up from sleep, he should wash his hands before
putting them in the wuḍū’ water for none of you knows where his
hands were during the night.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “If you fall asleep lying down you must
do wuḍū’ (before you pray).”

52

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that the āyat
“You who believe, when you get up to pray, wash your faces and your
arms to the elbows, and wipe over your heads, and [wash] your feet
up to the ankles,” (5:6) refers to rising from one’s bed, meaning
sleep.
11 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e position with us is that you do

not have to perform wuḍū’ on account of a nosebleed, or for blood,
or on account of pus issuing from the body. You only have to
perform wuḍū’ on account of impurities which issue from the
genitals or the anus, or for sleep.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Ibn ‘Umar used to
sleep while sitting and then would pray without performing wuḍū’.

2.3 What is pure for wuḍū’
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṣafwān ibn Sulaym from

Sa‘īd ibn Salama of the Banū Azraq from al-Mughīra ibn Abī
Burda of the tribe of Banu ʿAbd ad-Dār that he heard Abū Hurayra
speak about a man who came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and
said, “Messenger of Allah! We travel by sea and we do not carry
much fresh water with us so if we do wuḍū’ with it we go thirsty.
Can we do wuḍū’ with sea-water?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
replied, “Its water is pure, and its dead creatures are ḥalāl.”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn

Abī Ṭalha from Ḥumayda bint Abī ‘Ubayda ibn Farwa that her
maternal aunt, Kabsha bint Ka‘b ibn Mālik, who was the wife of the
son of Abū Qatāda al-Anṣārī, told her that once Abū Qatāda was
visiting her and she poured out some water for him to do wuḍū’
with. Just then a cat came to drink from it, so he tilted the vessel
toward it to let it drink. Kabsha continued, “He saw me looking at
him and said, ‘Are you surprised, daughter of my brother?’ I said,
‘Yes.’ He replied that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Cats are not
impure. ey intermingle with you.’”

53

Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “ere is no harm in that unless one sees
impurities on the cat’s mouth.”
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī from Yaḥyā ibn
ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Ḥāṭib that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb set out on
one occasion with a party of riders, one of whom was ‘Amr ibn
al-‘Āṣ. ey came to a watering place and ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ asked the
man who owned it whether wild beasts drank from it. ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb told the owner of the watering place not to answer, since
the people drank after the wild beasts and the wild beasts drank
after them.
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say that men and women used to do wuḍū’ together
in the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.

2.4 ings which do not break wuḍū’
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn ‘Umara

from Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm that the mother of the son of
Ibrāhīm ibn ʿAbd ar-Rahmān ibn ‘Awf questioned Umm Salama,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and said, “I am a woman who wears a
long skirt and (sometimes) I walk in dirty places.” Umm Salama
replied, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘What follows it (i.e.
clean places) puriﬁes it.’”
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he saw Rabi‘a ibn ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān regurgitate several times when he was in the mosque and
he did not leave nor did he do wuḍū’ before he prayed.
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether a man who regurgitated
food had to do wuḍū’ and he said, “He does not have to do wuḍū’,
but he should rinse the inside of his mouth and wash his mouth
out.”
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar prepared the body of one of Sa‘īd ibn Zayd’s sons for burial
54

and carried it and then entered the mosque and prayed without
doing wuḍū’.
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether it was necessary to do
wuḍū’ because of regurgitating undigested food and he said, “No,
wuḍū’ is not necessary, but the mouth should be rinsed.”

2.5 Not doing wuḍū’ on account of eating cooked food
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

ate a shoulder of lamb and then prayed without doing wuḍū’.

20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Bushayr ibn Yasār, the mawlā of the Banu Ḥāritha, that Suwayd ibn
an-Nu‘mān told him that he went with the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
on the expedition to Khaybar. When they reached aṣ-Ṣahbā’, which
was near Khaybar, the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stopped and prayed
‘Aṣr. He asked for food but only parched barley (sawīq) was
brought, so he asked for it to be moistened. e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬ate and we ate with him. en he got up to pray Maghrib and
rinsed his mouth and we rinsed ours. en he prayed without doing
wuḍū’ again.”
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that both Muḥammad ibn al-

Munkadir and Ṣafwān ibn Sulaym transmitted to him from
Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī from Rabī‘a ibn
‘Abdullāh ibn al-Hudayr that he had eaten an evening meal with
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb who then prayed without doing wuḍū’.
22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḍamra ibn Sa‘īd al-Māzinī

from Abān ibn ‘Uthmān that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān ate bread and
meat, rinsed his mouth out, washed his hands and wiped his face
with them, and then prayed without doing wuḍū’.

23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Alī ibn

Abī Ṭālib and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās did not do wuḍū’ after eating
cooked food.
55

24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

asked ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a whether a man who did wuḍū’
for prayer and then ate cooked food had to perform wuḍū’ again. He
said, “I saw my father do that without doing wuḍū’ again.”

25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Nu‘aym Wahb ibn

Kaysān that he heard Jābir ibn ʿAbdullāh al-Anṣārī saying, “I saw
Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq eat meat and then pray without doing wuḍū’.”

26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn alMunkadir that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was invited to eat, and

some bread and meat was brought to him. He ate some of it, and
then did wuḍū’ and prayed. en more of the same food was
brought and he ate some more and then prayed without doing
wuḍū’.
27 It was related to me from Mālik from Mūsā ibn ‘Uqba from

ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Yazīd al-Anṣārī that when Anas ibn Mālik
came back from Iraq, Abū Ṭalḥa and Ubayy ibn Ka‘b visited him.
He brought them some cooked food and they ate, and then Anas
got up and did wuḍū’. Abū Ṭalha and Ubayy ibn Ka‘b asked, “What
is this, Anas? Is this an Iraqi custom?” Anas said, “I wish I had not
done it (i.e. wuḍū’).” Abū Talḥa and Ubayy ibn Ka‘b both got up
and prayed without doing wuḍū’.

2.6 Wuḍū’ in general
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was asked about cleaning

oneself after excretion. He replied, “Are any of you unable to ﬁnd
three stones?”
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from al-‘Alā’ ibn ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān from his father from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬went to the burial grounds and said, “Peace be upon you,
home of a people who believe! We shall join you, Allah willing. I
wish that I had seen our brothers!” e people with him said,
56

“Messenger of Allah! Are we not your brothers?” “No,” he said,
“You are my companions. Our brothers are those who have not yet
come. And I will precede them to the Ḥawḍ.” ey asked him,
“Messenger of Allah! How will you recognise those of your
community who come after you?” He replied, “Does not a man who
has horses with white legs and white blazes on their foreheads
among totally black horses recognise which ones are his own?” ey
answered, “Of course, Messenger of Allah.” He went on, “Even so
will they come on the day of rising with white marks on their
foreheads, hands and feet from wuḍū’, and I will precede them to
the Ḥawḍ. Some men will be driven away from the Ḥawḍ as if they
were straying camels and I shall call out to them, ‘Will you not
come? Will you not come? Will you not come?’ and someone will
say, ‘ey changed things after you,’ so I shall say, ‘en away with
them, away with them, away with them!’”
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father from Ḥumrān, the mawlā of ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān, that
‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān was once sitting on the Maqā‘id (the benches
surrounding the mosque in Madīna, or else a stone near ‘Uthmān
ibn ‘Aﬀān’s house where he sat to discuss with people), when the
mu’adhdhin came and told him that it was time for the ‘Aṣr prayer.
He called for water and performed wuḍū’. en he said, “By Allah, I
shall tell you something which I would not tell you if it were not in
the Book of Allah. I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘If anyone
does wuḍū’, and does it well, and then performs the prayer, he will
be forgiven everything that he does between then and the time
when he prays the next prayer.’”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “I believe he meant this āyat: ‘Establish
the prayer at each end of the night and in the ﬁrst part of the night.
Good actions eradicate bad actions. is is a reminder for people
who pay heed.’ (11:114).”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār from ʿAbdullāh aṣ-Ṣanābiḥī that the Messenger of Allah
57

‫ ﷺ‬said, “When a believer does wuḍū’, as he rinses his mouth the

wrong actions leave it. As he cleans his nose the wrong actions leave
it. As he washes his face, the wrong actions leave it, even from
underneath his eyelashes. As he washes his hands the wrong actions
leave them, even from underneath his ﬁngernails. As he wipes his
head the wrong actions leave it, even from his ears. And as he
washes his feet the wrong actions leave them, even from underneath
the toenails of both his feet.” He added, “en his walking to the
mosque and his prayer are an extra reward for him.”
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Suhayl ibn Abī Ṣāliḥ from
his father from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“e Muslim (or the believer) does wuḍū’ and, as he washes his face,
every wrong action he has seen with his eyes leaves with the water
(or the last drop of water). As he washes his hands every wrong
action he has done with his hands leaves with the water (or the last
drop of water). And as he washes his feet every wrong action his feet
have walked to leaves with the water (or the last drop of water), so
that he comes away puriﬁed of wrong actions.”
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn

Abī Ṭalḥa that Anas ibn Mālik said, “I saw the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬when it was near the time of ‘Aṣr. People were looking for water
for wuḍū’ but could not ﬁnd any. en the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
was brought some water in a vessel. He put his hand into that vessel
and told them all to do wuḍū’ from it.” Anas added, “I saw water
gushing up from under his ﬁngers. en all of them to the last man
did wuḍū’.”
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nu‘aym ibn ʿAbdullāh al-

Madanī al-Mujmir that he heard Abū Hurayra say, “If someone
does wuḍū’ and does it correctly and then goes oﬀ intending to do
the prayer, he is in prayer as long as he intends to do the prayer. A
good action is written for every alternate step he makes and a wrong
action is erased for the other. When you hear the iqāma do not
lengthen your stride, and the one who has the greatest reward is the
58

one whose house is furthest away.” ey said, “Why, Abū Hurayra?”
He replied, “Because of the greater number of steps.”
35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

heard someone ask Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab about washing oﬀ excreta
with water. Sa‘īd said, “at is the way women wash.”

36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If a

dog drinks from a vessel belonging to one of you, he should wash it
seven times.”
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Try to go straight, although you will not be able

to do so. Act, and the best of your actions is the prayer. And only a
believer is constant in his wuḍū’.”

2.7 Wiping the head and ears
38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used two ﬁngers to bring up water to his ears.

39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Jābir ibn

ʿAbdullāh al-Anṣārī was asked about wiping over the turban. He
said, “Not unless you have wiped over your hair with water.”
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

Abū ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr used to take oﬀ his turban and wipe his
head with water.
41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that he saw Ṣaﬁyya

bint Abī ‘Ubayd, the wife of ʿAbdullah ibn ‘Umar, remove her headcovering and wipe her head with water. Nāﬁ‘ was a child at the time.
Mālik was asked about wiping over the turban and the headcovering. He said, “Neither the man nor the woman should wipe
59

over the turban or the head-covering. ey should wipe over the
head itself.”
Mālik was asked about someone who did wuḍū’ but forgot to wipe
his head until the water had dried. He said, “I think that he should
wipe his head and then repeat the prayer if he has already performed
it.”

2.8 Wiping over leather socks
42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Abbād

ibn Ziyād, a descendant of al-Mughīra ibn Shu‘ba, from his father
from al-Mughīra ibn Shu‘ba that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬went
to relieve himself during the expedition of Tabūk. Mughīra said, “I
went with him, taking water. en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came
back and I poured out the water for him. He washed his hands and
then went to bring his arms out of the sleeves of his garment, but
could not do so because of their narrowness. So he brought his arms
out from underneath his garment. en he washed his arms, wiped
his head and wiped over his leather socks. When the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬returned ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf was leading the people
in prayer, and he had already ﬁnished one rak‘a with them. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed the remaining rak‘a with them to
everyone’s concern. When the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ﬁnished he
said, ‘You have acted correctly.’”
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Nāﬁ‘ and ʿAbdullāh ibn

Dīnār told him that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar arrived at Kufa and went
to Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ, who was the governor of Kufa at that time.
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar saw him wiping over his leather socks and
disapproved of it. So Sa‘d told to him, “Ask your father when you
get back.” ʿAbdullāh returned but forgot to ask ‘Umar about the
matter until Sa‘d arrived and said, “Have you asked your father?”
and he answered, “No.” ʿAbdullāh then asked ‘Umar and ‘Umar
replied, “If your feet are ritually pure when you put them in the
leather socks then you can wipe over the socks.” ʿAbdullāh said,
60

“What about if we have just come from relieving ourselves?” ‘Umar
said, “Yes, even if you have just come from relieving yourself.”
44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar urinated in the market place and then did wuḍū’, washing his
face and hands and wiping his head. en as soon as he had come
into the mosque, he was called to pray over a dead person, so he
wiped over his leather socks and prayed over him.
45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Sa‘īd ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān

ibn Ruqaysh said, “I saw Anas ibn Mālik come, squat and urinate.
en water was brought and he did wuḍū’. He washed his face, then
his arms to the elbows, and then he wiped his head and wiped over
his leather socks. en he came to the mosque and prayed.”
Yaḥyā said: Mālik was asked whether someone who did wuḍū’ for
prayer and then put on his leather socks, and then urinated and took
them oﬀ and put them back on again, should begin wuḍū’ afresh.
Mālik replied, “He should take oﬀ his socks and wash his feet. Only
someone who puts on leather socks when his feet are (already)
ritually puriﬁed by wuḍū’ can wipe over them. Someone who puts
on leather socks when his feet are not ritually puriﬁed by wuḍū’
should not wipe over them.”
He said: Mālik was asked about someone who did wuḍū’ with his
leather socks on and forgot to wipe over them until the water was
dry and he had prayed, and he said, “He should wipe over his socks
and repeat the prayer but not repeat wuḍū’.”
Mālik was asked about someone who washed his feet and put on his
leather socks and then started doing wuḍū’, and he said, “He should
take oﬀ his socks and do wuḍū’ and wash his feet.”

2.9 How to wipe over leather socks
46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that he

saw his father wiping over his leather socks. He said, “When he
61

wiped over his socks he would never do more than wipe the tops
and he would not wipe the bottoms.”
47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik asked Ibn Shihāb how to wipe

over leather socks. Ibn Shihāb put one hand under the sock and his
other hand above the sock and then passed them over it.

Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “Of all that I have heard about the
matter I prefer the verdict of Ibn Shihāb.”

2.10 Nosebleeds in the prayer
48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar would leave and do wuḍū’ if he had a nosebleed and then
return and complete his prayer without speaking.

49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Abbās used to have nosebleeds and would leave to wash oﬀ the
blood. He would then return and complete his prayer.
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn ʿAbdullāh

Qusayṭ al-Laythī that he saw Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab having a
nosebleed while praying. He went oﬀ to the room of Umm Salama,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and water was brought to him and he did
wuḍū’.’ He then returned and completed his prayer.

2.11 Nosebleeds in general
51 Yaḥyā related to me that ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Harmala al-

Aslamī said, “I saw Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab with his nose bleeding
and the blood was pouring out of it so that his ﬁngers were all red
from the blood coming out of his nose, and prayed without doing
wuḍū’.
52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Mujabbar that he saw Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh with blood running
from his nose so that his ﬁngers were all coloured red. en he
rubbed his nose and he prayed without doing wuḍū’.”
62

2.12 Bleeding from a wound or a nosebleed
53 Yaḥyā related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his father that

al-Miswar ibn Makhrama told him that he had visited ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb on the night he was stabbed and had woken him up for
Ṣubḥ and ‘Umar had said, “Yes. Whoever stops doing the prayer will
get nothing from Islam,” and he did the prayer with blood pouring
from his wound.
54 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab was asked, “What do you say about someone who
is aﬄicted by a nosebleed which does not stop?” Mālik stated that
Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said, “I say that he
should gesture with his head.” (i.e. instead of doing sajda or rukū‘.)
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “at is what I like most out of what I
have heard about the matter.”

2.13 Wuḍū’ on account of prostatic ﬂuid
55 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from Sulaymān ibn Yasār from alMiqdād ibn al-Aswad that ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib told him to ask the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬what a man should do, who, when close to
his wife, had a ﬂow of prostatic ﬂuid. ‘Alī explained that the
daughter of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was living with him then and
he was too shy to ask for himself. Al-Miqdād said, “I asked the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about it, and he said, ‘When that happens,
wash your genitals with water and do wuḍū’ as for prayer.’”
56 Yaḥyā related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam from his father that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “I ﬁnd it dropping from me like small
beads. When that happens, wash your penis and do wuḍū’ as for
prayer.”
57 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from his

father that Jundub, the mawlā of ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Ayyāsh, said, “I
ʿ

63

asked ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar about prostatic ﬂuid and he said, ‘When
you ﬁnd it, wash your genitals and do wuḍū’ as for prayer.’”

2.14 Indulgence about not having to do wuḍū’ on account of
prostatic ﬂuid
58 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he was

listening to Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab and a man questioned him
saying, “I discover a discharge when I am praying. Should I leave?”
Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said to him, “Even if it were to ﬂow on my
leg I would not leave until I had ﬁnished the prayer.”
59 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that aṣ-Ṣalt ibn Zubayd said, “I

asked Sulaymān ibn Yasār about a discharge I discovered. He said,
‘Wash what is under your garments with water and forget about it.’”

2.15 Wuḍū’ on account of touching the genitals
60 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm heard ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr saying,
“I went to see Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam and we were talking about
what you had to do wuḍū’ for, and Marwān mentioned that you had
to do wuḍū’ if you touched your penis.” ‘Urwa said, “I did not know
that.” Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam said that Busra bint Ṣafwān had told
him that she heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, “If any of you
touches his penis he should do wuḍū’.”
61 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ismā‘īl ibn Muḥammad ibn

Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ that Muṣ‘ab ibn Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ said, “I
was holding the Qur’ān for Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ and I rubbed
myself. Sa‘d enquired whether I had touched my penis. I replied that
I had and he told me to get up and do wuḍū’. So I got up and did
wuḍū’ and then returned.”
62 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “If you touch your penis you have to do wuḍū’.”

64

63 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father used to say, “If any of you touches his penis he has to do
wuḍū’.”
64 Yaḥyā related from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh said, “I saw my father, ‘Yaḥyā ibn ‘Umar, do ghusl and
then do wuḍū’. I asked him, ‘Father, is ghusl not enough for you?’
He said, ‘Of course, but sometimes I touch my penis, so I do
wuḍū’.’”

65 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh said, “I was with ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar on a journey and
after the sun had risen I saw him do wuḍū’ and then pray, so I
remarked to him, ‘is is not a prayer that you normally do.’ He
said, ‘After I had done wuḍū’ for Ṣubḥ, I touched my genitals. en
I forgot to do wuḍū’. So I did wuḍū’ again and repeated my prayer.’”

2.16 Wuḍū’ on account of a man kissing his wife
66 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh that his father ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to say, “A man’s
kissing his wife and fondling her with his hands are part of
intercourse. Someone who kisses his wife or fondles her with his
hand must perform wuḍū’.”
67 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn Mas‘ūd used to say, “Wuḍū’ is necessary if a man kisses his
wife.”
68 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb used to say,

“Wuḍū’ is necessary if a man kisses his wife.”

Nāﬁ‘ said that Mālik said, “at is what I like most out of what I
have heard.”

2.17 How to perform ghusl on account of major ritual impurity

65

69 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father from ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mūminīn, that whenever the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did ghusl for major ritual impurity, he would
begin by washing his hands, and then do wuḍū’ as for prayer. He
would then put his ﬁngers in the water and rub the roots of his hair
with them. en he would pour as much water as two hands can
hold on to his head three times, and pour it over the entire surface
of his skin.
70 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr from ‘Ā’isha, the Umm al-Mūminīn, that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to do ghusl for major ritual impurity from a vessel
called a faraq.
71 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that when ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar used to do ghusl for major ritual impurity he would begin
by pouring water on his right hand and washing it. en, in order,
he would wash his genitals, rinse his mouth, snuﬀ water in and out
of his nose, wash his face and splash his eyes with water. en he
would wash his right arm and then his left, and after that he would
wash his head. He would ﬁnish by having a complete wash and
pouring water all over himself.
72 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that ‘Ā’isha was

asked about how a woman should perform ghusl for major ritual
impurity. She said, “She should scoop water over her head with both
hands three times and rub the roots of her hair with her hands.”

2.18 Ghusl from the two “circumcised parts” meeting
73 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān and
‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬used to say, “When the
circumcised part touches the circumcised part, then ghusl is
obligatory.”

66

74 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ʿAbdullāh that Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn
‘Awf related that he had asked ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬,
what made ghusl obligatory. She said, “Do you know what you are
like, Abū Salama? You are like a chick when it hears the cocks
crowing and so crows with them. When the circumcised part passes
the circumcised part, ghusl becomes obligatory.”
75 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab that Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī came to ‘Ā’isha, the wife
of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and said to her, “e disagreement of the
Companions about a matter which I hate to bring before you has
distressed me.” She asked, “What is that? You did not ask your
mother about it, so ask me.” He said, “A man penetrates his wife,
but becomes listless and does not ejaculate.” She answered, “When
the circumcised part passes the circumcised part ghusl is obligatory.”
Abū Mūsā added, “I shall never ask anyone about this after you.”
76 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

ʿAbdullāh ibn Ka‘b, the mawlā of ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān, that
Maḥmūd ibn Labīd al-Anṣārī asked Zayd ibn ābit about a man
who penetrated his wife but became listless and did not ejaculate.
Zayd ibn ābit said, “He does ghusl.” Maḥmūd said to him,
“Ubayy ibn Ka‘b used not to think that ghusl was necessary” but
Zayd ibn ābit said, “Ubayy ibn Ka‘b retracted that position before
he died.”
77 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Ghusl becomes obligatory when the circumcised
part touches the circumcised part.”

2.19 Wuḍū’ of a person in a state of major ritual impurity
(janāba) when he wants to go to sleep or eat before having a ghusl
78 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār that

ʿAbdullah ibn ‘Umar related that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb mentioned
to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬that he would sometimes become
67

junub in the night. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him, “Do
wuḍū’ and wash your penis, and then go to sleep.”
79 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬used to say, “If you

have intercourse with your wife and then wish to go to sleep before
doing ghusl, do not sleep until you have done wuḍū’ as you do it for
prayer.”
80 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar, if he wished to sleep or eat while junub, would wash his face
and his arms to the elbows and wipe his head. en he would eat or
sleep.

2.20 e repetition of the prayer by a person in a state of major
ritual impurity, his doing ghusl when he has prayed without
remembering it, and his washing his garments
81 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ismā‘īl ibn Abī Ḥakīm that
‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār told him that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said the

takbīr in one of the prayers and then indicated to them with his
hand to stay in place. He left and then returned with traces of water
on his skin.
82 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

Zubayd ibn aṣ-Ṣalṭ said, “I went with ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb to Juruf
and he looked down and noticed that he had had a wet dream and
had prayed without doing ghusl. He exclaimed, ‘By Allah, I realise
that I have had a wet dream and did not know it and I have not
done ghusl!’ So he did ghusl and washed oﬀ whatever he saw on his
garment, and sprinkled with water whatever he did not see. en he
gave the adhān or the iqāma and prayed in the mid-morning.”
83 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ismā‘īl ibn Abī Ḥakim

from Sulaymān ibn Yasār that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb went out early
in the morning to his land in Juruf and found semen on his
garment. He said, “I have been tried with wet dreams since I was
68

entrusted with governing the people.” He did ghusl, washed any
semen that he saw from his garment, and then prayed after the sun
had risen.
84 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Sulaymān ibn Yasār that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb led the people in the
Ṣubh prayer and then went out to his land in Juruf and found semen
on his clothes. He said, “Since we have been eating rich meat our
veins have become fulsome.” He did ghusl, washed the semen from
his clothing, and did his prayer again.
85 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father from Yaḥyā ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Ḥāṭib that he had
set oﬀ for ‘umra with ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb in a party of riders
among whom was ‘Amr ibn al-‘As. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
dismounted for a rest late at night on a certain road near a certain
oasis. ‘Umar had a wet dream when it was almost dawn and there
was no water among the riding party. He rode until he came to
some water and then he began to wash oﬀ what he saw of the semen
until it had gone. ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ said to him, “It is morning and
there are clothes with us, so allow your garment to be washed.”
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said to him, “I am surprised at you, ‘Amr ibn
al-‘Āṣ! Even if you can ﬁnd clothes, is everybody be able to ﬁnd
them? By Allah, if I were to do that, it would become a sunna. No, I
wash what I see, and I sprinkle with water what I do not see.”
Mālik spoke about a man who found traces of a wet dream on his
clothes and did not know when it had occurred and did not
remember anything he had seen in his sleep. He said, “Let the
intention of his ghusl be from the time when he last slept, and if he
has prayed since that last sleep he should repeat it. is is because
sometimes a man has a wet dream and sees nothing, and sometimes
he sees something but does not have an emission. So if he ﬁnds
liquid on his garment he must do ghusl. is is because ‘Umar
repeated what he had prayed after the time he had last slept and not
what was before it.”
69

2.21 Ghusl of a woman when she experiences the same as a man
in her sleep
86 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn
az-Zubayr that Umm Sulaym asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬,

“Should a woman do ghusl when she experiences the same as a man
in her sleep?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to her, “Yes, she
should have a ghusl. ‘Ā’isha said to her, “Shame on you! Does a
woman see that?” (i.e. a liquid.) e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to
her, “May your right hand be full of dust. From where does family
resemblance come?”
87 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father from Zaynab bint Abī Salama that Umm Salama, the
wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “Umm Sulaym, the wife of Abū Ṭalḥa
al-Anṣārī, came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said, “Messenger
of Allah! Allah is not shy about the truth – does a woman have to
do ghusl if she has had an erotic dream?” He said, ‘Yes, if she has a
visible discharge.’”

2.22 Ghusl for major ritual impurity
88 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “ere is no harm in doing ghusl with water that
has been used by one’s wife as long as she is not menstruating or in a
state of major ritual impurity (janāba).”
89 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to sweat in a garment while he was in janāba and then
pray wearing it.
90 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that the slave-girls of

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to wash his feet and bring him a mat of
palm-leaves while they were menstruating.

Mālik was asked whether a man who had wives and slave-girls could
have intercourse with all of them before he did ghusl. He said,
“ere is no harm in a man having intercourse with two of his slave70

girls before he does ghusl. It is disapproved of, however, to go to a
free woman on another’s day. ere is no harm having intercourse
ﬁrst with one slave girl and then with another when one is junub.”
Mālik was asked about a man who was junub and water was put
down for him to do ghusl with. en he forgot and put his ﬁnger
into it to ﬁnd out whether it was hot or cold. Mālik said, “If no
impurity has soiled his ﬁngers, I do not consider that that makes the
water impure.”

2.23 Tayammum
91 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim from his father that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mūminīn, said, “We
went out on a journey with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and, when
we came to Baydā’ or Dhāt al-Jaysh, a necklace of mine broke. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stopped to look for it and the people stopped
with him. ere was no water nearby and the people were not
carrying any with them, so they went to Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq and
said, ‘Do you not see what ‘Ā’isha has done? She has made the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and the people stop when there is no water
nearby and they are not carrying any with them.’”
‘Ā’isha continued, “Abū Bakr came and the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
had fallen asleep with his head on my thigh. Abū Bakr said, ‘You
have made the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and the people stop when
there is no water nearby and they are not carrying any with them.’”
She continued, “Abū Bakr remonstrated with me and said whatever
Allah willed him to say, and began to poke me in the waist. e only
thing that stopped me from moving was that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had his head on my thigh. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬slept
until morning found him with no water. Allah, the Blessed and
Exalted, sent down the āyat of tayammum and so they did
tayammum. Usayd ibn Huḍayr said, ‘is is not the ﬁrst blessing
from you, O family of Abū Bakr.’”
Ā

71

‘Ā’isha added, “We roused the camel I had been on and found the
neck-lace under it.”

Mālik was asked whether someone who did tayammum for one
prayer should do tayammum when the time of the next prayer came
or whether the ﬁrst tayammum was enough. He said, “No, he does
tayammum for every prayer, because he has to look for water for
every prayer. If he looks for it and does not ﬁnd it then he does
tayammum.”
Mālik was asked whether a man who did tayammum could lead
others in prayer if they were in wuḍū’. He said, “I prefer that
someone else should lead them. However, I see no harm in it if he
does lead them in prayer.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said that if a man did tayammum because he
could not ﬁnd any water, and then stood and said the takbīr and
entered into the prayer, and then someone came with some water,
he does not stop his prayer but completes it with tayammum and
then does wuḍū’ for future prayers.
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “Whoever gets up to pray and does not
ﬁnd water and so does what Allah has ordered him to do of
tayammum has obeyed Allah. Someone who does ﬁnd water is
neither purer than him nor more perfect in prayer, because both
have been commanded and each does as Allah has commanded.
What Allah has commanded as far as wuḍū’ is concerned is for the
one who ﬁnds water, and tayammum is for the one who does not
ﬁnd water before he enters into the prayer.”
Mālik said that a man who was in a state of major ritual impurity
could do tayammum and read his portion of Qur’ān and do
voluntary prayers as long as he did not ﬁnd any water. is applied
only to circumstances in which it was allowable to pray with
tayammum.

2.24 How to do tayammum
92 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar and he were approaching Juruf. When they got to Mirbad,
ʿAbdullāh got down and did tayammum with some good earth. He
wiped his face, and his arms to the elbows, and then prayed.

93 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to do tayammum up to his elbows.

Mālik was asked about how tayammum was done and what parts
were covered and he said, “Strike the ground once for the face and
once for the arms and wipe them to the elbows.”

2.25 Tayammum of someone in a state of major ritual impurity
94 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn

Ḥarmala that a man asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab about what a man
who was junub and had done tayammum should do when he found
water. Sa‘īd said, “When he ﬁnds water he must do ghusl for what
comes after.”

Mālik said about someone who had a wet dream while he was on a
journey and there was only enough water for wuḍū’ and he was not
thirsty so he did not need to use it for drinking. “Let him wash his
genitals, and whatever the semen has fallen on, with the water and
then he does tayammum with good earth as Allah has ordered him.”
Mālik was asked whether a man who was junub and wished to do
tayammum but could only ﬁnd salty earth could do tayammum with
that earth, and whether it was disapproved of to pray on salty earth.
He said, “ere is no harm in praying on salty earth or in using it to
do tayammum because Allah the Blessed and Exalted has said,
‘...and do tayammum with good earth.’ One is puriﬁed by
tayammum with everything that is earth, whether it is salty or
otherwise.”

2.26 What is permitted to a man from his wife when she is
menstruating
95 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that a man
questioned the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, saying, “What is permitted

to me from my wife when she is menstruating?” e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Let her wrap her waist-wrapper round herself
tightly, and then what is above that is your concern.”
96 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbd arRaḥmān that on one occasion ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬was
sleeping with the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, in one garment, when
suddenly she jumped up sharply. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to

her, “What’s the matter with you? Are you losing blood?” meaning
menstruating. She said, “Yes.” He said, “Wrap your waist-wrapper
tightly about you, and return to your sleeping-place.”

97 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Ubaydullāh ibn

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar sent a question to ‘Ā’isha asking her, “May a
man fondle his wife when she is menstruating?” She replied, “Let
her wrap her waist-wrapper around her lower part and then he may
fondle her if he wishes.”
98 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh and Sulaymān ibn Yasār were asked whether the husband
of a menstruating woman could have sexual intercourse with her
when she saw that she was pure but before she had had a ghusl.
ey said, “No, not until she has had a ghusl.”

2.27 e purity of a woman after menstruation
99 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Alqama ibn Abī ‘Alqama

that his mother, the mawlā of ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mūminīn, said,
“Women used to send little boxes to ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mūminīn,
with a piece of cotton cloth in each one on which was yellowness
from menstrual blood, asking her about the prayer. She said to

74

them, “Do not be hasty until you see a white discharge.” By that she
meant purity from menses.
100 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

from his paternal aunt from the daughter of Zayd ibn ābit that
she had heard that women used to ask for lamps in the middle of
the night to check their purity. She would criticise them for this
saying, “Women never used to do this,” i.e. in the time of the
Companions.
101 Mālik was asked whether a woman whose period had ﬁnished

could do tayammum to purify herself if she could not ﬁnd water and
he said, “Yes, because she is like some one in a state of major ritual
impurity, who, if he cannot ﬁnd water, does tayammum.”

2.28 Menstruation in general
102 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Ā’isha,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said that a pregnant woman who noticed

bleeding left oﬀ from prayer.

103 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he asked Ibn Shihāb about

a pregnant woman who noticed bleeding. Ibn Shihāb replied, “She
refrains from prayer.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “at is what is done in our
community.”
104 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “I used to
comb the head of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬while I was

menstruating.”

105 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father from Fāṭima bint al-Mundhir ibn az-Zubayr that Asmā’
bint Abī Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq said, “A woman asked the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬saying, ‘What do you think a woman should do if
menstrual blood gets on her clothes?’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
75

said, ‘’If menstrual blood gets onto the clothes of any of you, she
should gather up the place in her ﬁngers, rub it, and wash it with
water and then she can pray in it.’”

2.29 Bleeding as if menstruating
106 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “Fāṭima bint

Abī Ḥubaysh said, ‘Messenger of Allah, I never become pure.
Should I abandon the prayer?’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘at is due to a vein, not menstruation. So when your period
comes, leave oﬀ from the prayer, and when its normal length ends,
wash the blood from yourself and pray.’”
107 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Sulaymān ibn
Yasār from Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that a certain
woman in the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to bleed
profusely, so Umm Salama consulted the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬for

her, and he said, “She should calculate the number of nights and
days a month that she used to menstruate before it started
happening, and she should leave oﬀ from prayer for that much of
the month. When she has completed that she should do ghusl, bind
her private parts with a cloth, and then pray.”
108 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father from Zaynab, the daughter of Umm Salama, that she saw
Zaynab bint Jaḥsh, the wife of ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf, and she
used to bleed as if menstruating. She would have a ghusl and pray.
109 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of

Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that al-Qa‘qā‘ ibn Ḥakīm and Zayd
ibn Aslam sent him to Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab to ask how a woman,
who was bleeding as if menstruating, should have a ghusl. Sa‘īd said,
“She does a ghusl to cover from the end of one period to the end of
the next, and does wuḍū’ for every prayer, and if bleeding overtakes
her she should bind her private parts.”

76

110 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father said, “A woman who bleeds as if menstruating only has to
do one ghusl, and then after that she does wuḍū’ for each prayer.”

Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e position with us is that when a
woman who bleeds as if menstruating starts to do the prayer again,
her husband can have sexual intercourse with her. Similarly, if a
woman who has given birth sees blood after she has reached the
fullest extent that bleeding normally restrains women, her husband
can have sexual intercourse with her and she is in the same position
as a woman who bleeds as if menstruating.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e position with us concerning a
woman who bleeds as if menstruating is founded on the ḥadīth of
Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his father, and it is what I prefer the most
of what I have heard about the matter.”

2.30 e urine of an infant boy
111 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “An infant
boy was brought to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and it urinated on
him. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬called for some water and rubbed

over the urine with it.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from
‘Ubaydullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd from Umm Qays
ibn Miḥṣan that she brought a baby boy of hers who was not yet
eating food to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he sat him in his lap
and and the boy urinated on his clothes, so the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬called for some water and sprinkled over it but did not wash it.
112

2.31 Urinating standing and otherwise
113 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “A

Bedouin came into the mosque and uncovered his private parts to
urinate. e people called out to him and began to raise their voices
but the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Let him be.’ So they let him be
77

and he urinated. en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered a
bucketful of water to be brought and it was poured on the place.”
114 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār said,

“I saw ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar urinating while standing.”

Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked if any ḥadīth had come down about
washing the private parts from urine and faeces and he said, “I have
heard that some of those who have passed away used to wash
themselves after defecating. I like to wash my private parts from
urine.”

2.32 e tooth-stick (siwāk)
115 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ibn asSabbāq that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said in a jumu‘a, “Muslims!

Allah has made this day a festival day so do ghusl, and it will do no
harm if whoever has perfume to applies some of it, and use a toothstick.”
116 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū’z-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Were

it not that I would be overburdening my community I would have
ordered them to use the tooth-stick.”
117 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ḥumayd

ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf that Abū Hurayra said, “Were it not
that he would have been overburdening his community he (the
Messenger of Allah ‫ )ﷺ‬would have ordered them to use the toothstick with each wuḍū’.”

78

3. Prayer
3.1 e call to prayer
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had wanted to take two pieces of wood to

strike them together to gather people for the prayer, and ʿAbdullāh
ibn Zayd al-Anṣārī, of the tribe of Ḥārith ibn al-Khazraj, was shown
two pieces of wood in his sleep. He said, ‘ese are close to what the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬wants.’ en it was said, ‘Do you not call to
the prayer?’ When he woke up he went to the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬and mentioned the dream to him. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
ordered the adhān.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Aṭā’ ibn

Yazīd al-Laythī from Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When you hear the adhān, repeat what the
mu’adhdhin says.”

3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān, from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stated, “If people only knew what was in the call to
prayer and the ﬁrst row, and could ﬁnd no other way to get it than
drawing lots for it, they would draw lots for it. If they only knew
what was in going early to the prayer, they would race each other to
get there. And if they only knew what was in the prayers of ‘Ishā’
and Ṣubḥ, they would come to them even if they had to crawl.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from al-‘Alā’ ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān

ibn Ya‘qūb from his father and Isḥāq ibn ʿAbdullāh that they
informed him that they heard Abū Hurayra say, “e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘When the iqāma is called for prayer, do not come to
it running, but come with calmness. Pray what you catch and
complete what you miss. You are in prayer as long as your aim is the
prayer.’”
79

ʿ

5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn

ʿAbdullāh ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī Ṣa‘ṣa‘a al-Anṣārī, later alMāzinī, that his father told him that Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī had said
to him, “I see that you love sheep and the desert. When you are
among your sheep or in the desert, call the prayer and raise your
voice in the adhān because I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say,
‘No jinn or man or anything within range hears the voice of the
mu’adhdhin without bearing witness for him on the Day of Rising.’”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from AlA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“When the call to prayer is made Shayṭān retreats, passing wind, so
that he will not hear it. When the adhān is completed he comes
back, until, when the iqāma is said, he retreats again. When the
iqāma is completed, he comes back, until he comes between a man
and his self and says, ‘ink of such and such, think of such and
such,’ which he was not thinking about before, until the man does
not know how much he has prayed.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Ḥāzim ibn Dīnār that

Sahl ibn Sa‘d as-Sā‘idī said, “ere are two times when the gates of
heaven are opened, and few who make supplication have it returned
to them unanswered. ey are at the time of the adhān, and when in
a rank of people ﬁghting in the way of Allah.”
Mālik was asked whether the adhān on the day of jumu‘a was called
before the time had come for the prayer and he said, “It is not called
until after the sun has passed the meridian.”
Mālik was asked about doubling the adhān and the iqāma, and at
what point people had to stand when the iqāma for the prayer was
called. He said, “I have heard nothing about the adhān and iqāma
except what I have seen people do. As for the iqāma, it is not
doubled. at is what the people of knowledge in our region
continue to do. As for people standing up when the iqāma for the
prayer is called, I have not heard of any deﬁnite point at which it is
begun, and I consider it rather to be according to people’s
80

(individual) capacity, for some people are heavy and some are light,
and they are not able to act as one person.”
Mālik was asked about a gathering of people who wished to perform
the prescribed prayer calling the iqāma but not the adhān, and he
said, “It is enough for them. e adhān is only obligatory in
mosques where the prayer is performed in congregation.”
Mālik was asked about the mu’adhdhin saying “Peace be upon you”
to the imām and calling him to the prayer, and he was asked who
was the ﬁrst person to whom such a greeting was made. He replied,
“I have not heard that this greeting occurred in the ﬁrst
community.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether a mu’adhdhin who called
the people to prayer and then waited to see if anyone would come
and no one did, so he said the iqāma and did the prayer by himself
and then people came after he had ﬁnished, should repeat the prayer
with them. Mālik said, “He does not repeat the prayer, and whoever
comes after he has ﬁnished should do the prayer by himself.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked about a mu’adhdhin who called the
adhān for a group of people, did voluntary prayers, and then the
group of people wanted to do the prayer with some one else saying
the iqāma. He said, “ere is no harm in that. His iqāma or
somebody else’s are the same.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e Ṣubḥ prayer is still called before
dawn. As for the other prayers, we believe that they should only be
called after the time has started.”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the

mu’adhdhin came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb to call him to the Ṣubḥ
prayer and found him asleep, so he said, “Prayer is better than
sleep,” and ‘Umar ordered him to put that in the adhān for Ṣubḥ.
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from his paternal uncle Abū

Suhayl ibn Mālik that his uncle’s father said, “I recognise nothing
81

nowadays of what I saw the people (i.e. the Companions of the
Messenger ‫ )ﷺ‬doing except the call to prayer.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar heard

the iqāma while he was in Baqī‘, so he quickened his pace in
walking to the mosque.

3.2 e adhān on a journey and without wuḍū’
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar called the adhān on a cold and windy night and included the
phrase, “Pray in your houses.” en he said, “e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to order the mu’adhdhin to say, ‘Pray in your houses’
when it was a cold, rainy night.”
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that when he was on

a journey ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar did no more than call the iqāma,
except in the case of Ṣubḥ, when he called both the adhān and the
iqāma. ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to say, “e adhān is for an imām
whom people join [for the prayer].”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father told him, “When you are on a journey you can, if you wish,
call both the adhān and the iqāma, or, if you wish, the iqāma and
not the adhān.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “ere is no harm in a man
calling the adhān while riding.”
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab used to say, “If someone prays in waterless,
desolate land, an angel prays on his right and an angel prays on his
left. When he calls both the adhān and the iqāma for the prayer, or
calls out the iqāma, mountains of angels pray behind him.”

3.3 e meal before dawn (saḥūr) in relation to the adhān
82

ʿ

15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār from
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Bilāl

calls the adhān whilst it is still night so eat and drink until Ibn
Umm Maktūm calls the adhān.”
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn
ʿAbdullāh that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Bilāl calls the

adhān in the night, so eat and drink until Ibn Umm Maktūm calls
the adhān.” Ibn Umm Maktūm was a blind man who did not call
the adhān until someone said to him, “e morning has come. e
morning has come.”

3.4 e opening of the prayer
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬used to raise his hands level with his shoulders when he began
the prayer, and when he raised his head from rukū‘ he raised them
in the same way, saying, “Allah hears whoever praises him, our Lord
and praise belongs to You.” He did not do that in the sujūd.

Sami‘a’llāhu liman ḥamidah. Rabbanā wa laka’l-ḥamd.
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ‘Alī ibn
Ḥusayn ibn ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used

to say, ‘Allah is greater’ whenever he lowered himself and raised
himself, and he continued to pray like that until he met Allah.”
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from
Sulaymān ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to raise his

hands in the prayer.

20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū

Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf that Abū Hurayra used to
lead them in prayer and would say “Allah is greater” whenever he
lowered himself and raised himself. When he had ﬁnished he would
say, “By Allah, I am the person whose prayer most resembles the
prayer of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.”
83

21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh that ʿAbdullah ibn ‘Umar used to say “Allah is greater” in
the prayer whenever he lowered himself and raised himself.

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar used to raise his hands to the level of his shoulders when he
began the prayer and when he came up from rukū‘ he would raise
them less than that.
22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Nu‘aym Wahb ibn

Kaysān that Jābir ibn ʿAbdullāh used to teach them the takbīr in the
prayer. Abū Nu‘aym said, “He used to tell us to say ‘Allah is greater’
whenever we lowered or raised ourselves.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb used to say,

“When a man catches the rak‘a he says, ‘Allah is greater’ once, and
that takbīr is enough for him.”
Mālik added, “at is if he intended to begin the prayer by that
takbīr.”
Mālik was asked about a man who began the prayer with the imām
but forgot the opening takbīr and the takbīr of the rukū‘ until he
had done one rak‘a. en he remembered that he had not said the
takbīr at the opening nor in the rukū‘, so he said the takbīr in the
second rak‘a. He said, “I prefer that he start his prayer again, but if
he forgets the opening takbīr with the imām and says the takbīr in
the ﬁrst rukū‘, I consider that enough for him if he intends by it the
opening takbīr.”
Mālik said about someone who prayed by himself and forgot the
opening takbīr, “He should begin his prayer afresh.”
Mālik said about an imām who forgot the opening takbīr until he
had ﬁnished his prayer, “I think that he should do the prayer again,
and those behind him, even if they have said the takbīr.”

3.5 e recitation of Qur’ān in the Maghrib and ‘Ishā’ prayers
84

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from
Muḥammad ibn Jubayr ibn Muṭ‘im that his father said, “I heard the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬recite aṭ-Ṭūr (sūra 52) in the Maghrib
prayer.”
24

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from
‘Ubaydullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd from ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Abbās that Umm al-Faḍl bint al-Ḥārith heard him reciting alMursalāt (sūra 77) and she said to him, “My son, you have reminded
me by reciting this sūra that it was what I last heard the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬recite in the Maghrib prayer.”
25

26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū ‘Ubayd, the mawlā of

Sulaymān ibn ʿAbd al-Mālik, from ‘Ubāda ibn Nusayy from Qays
ibn al-Ḥārith that Abū ʿAbdullāh aṣ-Ṣunābiḥī said, “I arrived in
Madīna during the khalifate of Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq, and I prayed
Maghrib behind him. He recited the Umm al-Qur’ān and two sūras
from the shorter ones of the Mufaṣṣal in the ﬁrst two rak‘as. en
he stood up in the third and I drew so near to him that my clothes
were almost touching his clothes. I heard him reciting the Umm alQur’ān and this āyat, ‘Our Lord, do not make our hearts deviate
after You have guided us. And give us mercy from You. You are the
Ever-Giving.’” (3:8).
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to recite in all four rak‘as when he prayed alone – in
every rak‘a the Umm al-Qur’ān and another sūra from the Qur’ān.
Sometimes he would recite two or three sūras in one rak‘a in the
obligatory prayer. Similarly, he recited the Umm al-Qur’ān and two
sūras in the ﬁrst two rak‘as of Maghrib.
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Adī

ibn ābit al-Anṣārī that al-Barā’ ibn ‘Āzib said, “I prayed ‘Ishā’
with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he recited at-Tīn (sūra 95) in
it.”

85

3.6 Behaviour in the recitation
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Ibrāhīm ibn

ʿAbdullah ibn Ḥunayn from his father from ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade wearing the qassī (an Egyptian
garment, striped with silk), wearing gold rings, and reciting the
Qur’ān in rukū‘.
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī from Abū Ḥāzim
at-Tammār from al-Bayāḍī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came
out to the people while they were praying and their voices were
raised in the recitation. He said, “When you pray you are talking
conﬁdentially to your Lord. So look to what you conﬁde to Him,
and do not say the Qur’ān out loud so that others hear it.”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd aṭ-Ṭawīl that

Anas ibn Mālik said, “I stood behind Abū Bakr and ‘Umar and
‘Uthmān and none of them used to recite ‘In the Name of Allah, the
All-Merciful, the Most Merciful’ when they began the prayer.”
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from his paternal uncle Abū

Suhayl ibn Mālik that his father said, “We heard the recitation of
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb when we were at the home of Abū Jahm in alBalāṭ.”

33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that when ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar missed anything of a prayer in which the imām had
recited out loud, he would stand up when the imām had said the
taslīm and recite what he owed out loud by himself.
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yazīd ibn Rumān said, “I

used to pray next to Nāﬁ‘ ibn Jubayr ibn Mut‘im and he would
nudge me to prompt him while we were praying.”

3.7 e recitation in the Ṣubḥ prayer

86

35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq prayed Ṣubḥ and recited Sūrat
al-Baqara in the two rak‘as.
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father heard ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a say, “We prayed Ṣubḥ
behind ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and he recited Sūra Yūsuf (sūra 12)
and Sūrat al-Ḥajj (sūra 22) slowly.”
“I (Hishām’s father) said, ‘By Allah, then it must have been his habit
to get up at the crack of dawn.’ He said, ‘Of course.’”
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd and Rabi‘a

ibn Abī ʿAbd ar-Rahmān from al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad that alFurāﬁṣa ibn ‘Umayr al-Ḥanafī said, “I only learnt Sūra Yūsuf (sūra
12) from the recitation of it by ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān in the Ṣubḥ
prayer because of the great number of times he repeated it to us.”

38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to recite the ﬁrst ten sūras of the Mufaṣṣal in the Ṣubḥ
prayer, and on a journey he would recite the Umm al-Qur’ān and a
sūra in every rak‘a.

3.8 e Umm al-Qur’ān
39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from al-‘Alā’ ibn ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān ibn Ya‘qūb that Abū Sa‘īd, the mawlā of ‘Āmir ibn Kurayz,
told him that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬called to ‘Ubayy ibn Ka‘b
while he was praying. When ‘Ubayy had ﬁnished his prayer he
joined the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and the Messenger of Allah put
his hand upon his hand, and he was intending to leave by the door
of the mosque, so the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I hope that you
will not leave the mosque until you know a sūra whose like Allah
has not sent down in the Torah nor in the Gospel nor in the
Qur’ān.” ‘Ubayy said, “I began to slow down my pace in the hope of
that. en I said, ‘Messenger of Allah, the sūra you promised me!’
He said, ‘What do you recite when you begin the prayer?’ I recited
87

the Fātiḥa (sūra 1) until I came to the end of it, and the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘It is this sūra, and it is the “Seven Oft-Repeated”
and the “ Magniﬁcent Qur’ān” which I was given.’”
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Nu‘aym Wahb ibn

Kaysān that he heard Jābir ibn ʿAbdullāh say, “Someone who prays a
rak‘a without reciting the Umm al-Qur’ān in it has not performed
the prayer, unless he is praying behind an imām.”

3.9 Reciting to oneself behind the imām when he does not recite
aloud
41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from al-‘Alā’ ibn ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān ibn Ya‘qūb that he heard Abū as-Sā‘ib, the mawlā of
Hishām ibn Zuhra, say he had heard Abū Hurayra say, “I heard the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘If someone prays a prayer without
reciting the Umm al-Qur’ān in it, his prayer is aborted, it is aborted.
It is aborted, incomplete.’ So I said, ‘Abū Hurayra, sometimes I am
behind the imām.’ He pulled my forearm and said, ‘Recite it to
yourself, O Persian, for I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say that
Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, said, “I have divided the prayer into
two halves between me and my slave. One half of it is for Me and
one half of it is for My slave, and My slave has what he asks for.”’
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Recite.” e slave says, ‘Praise be
to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.’ Allah the Blessed, the Exalted,
says, ‘My slave has praised Me.’ e slave says, ‘e All-Merciful,
the Most Merciful.’ Allah says, ‘My slave has spoken well of Me.’
e slave says, ‘King of the Day of the Dīn.’ Allah says, ‘My slave
has gloriﬁed Me.’ e slave says, ‘You alone we worship and You
alone we ask for help.’ Allah says, ‘is āyat is between Me and My
slave, and for My slave is what he asks for.’ e slave says, ‘Guide us
on the straight Path, the Path of those whom You have blessed, not
of those with whom You are angry, nor those who are in error.’
Allah says, ‘ese are for My slaves, and for My slave is what he
asks for.’”

88

42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father used to recite behind the imām when the imām did not recite
aloud.

43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd and from

Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad
used to recite behind the imām when the imām did not recite aloud.

44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn Rūmān that Nāﬁ‘

ibn Jubayr ibn Muṭ‘im used to recite behind the imām when he did
not recite aloud.

Mālik said, “at is what I prefer of what I have heard about the
matter.”

3.10 Not reciting behind the imām when he recites aloud
45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar, when asked if anyone should recite behind an imām, said,
“When you pray behind an imām then the recitation of the imām is
enough for you, and when you pray on your own you must recite.”
Nāﬁ‘ added, “ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used not to recite behind the
imām.”

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e position with us is that a
man recites behind the imām when the imām does not recite aloud
and he refrains from reciting when the imām recites aloud.”
46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ibn

Ukayma al-Laythī from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬ﬁnished a prayer in which he had recited aloud and asked, “Did
any of you recite with me just now?” One man said, “Yes, I did,
Messenger of Allah.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I was saying
to myself, ‘Why am I distracted from the Qur’ān?’” When the
people heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say that, they refrained
from reciting with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬when he recited
aloud.
89

3.11 Saying ‘amīn’ behind the imām
47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab and Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān told him from
Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When the
imām says ‘Amīn’, say ‘Amīn’. If someone’s ‘Amīn’ coincides with
that of the angels, he will be forgiven his past wrong actions.”
Ibn Shihāb said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to say ‘Āmīn’
(extending it).”
48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr, from Abū Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān, from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When the imām has said, ‘not of those
with anger on them nor of those who are in error,’ say ‘Amīn’, for
the past wrong actions of all those whose utterance coincides with
that of the angels are forgiven them.”
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“When any of you say ‘Amīn’ and the angels in the heavens also say
‘Amīn’ so that the one coincides with the other, his past wrong
actions are forgiven him.”

50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr, from Abū Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When the imām says, ‘Allah hears
whoever praises Him,’ say, ‘O Allah, our Lord, praise belongs to
You.’ Anyone whose words coincide with those of the angels will be
forgiven his past wrong actions.’”

3.12 Behaviour in the sitting in the prayer
51 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muslim ibn Abī Maryam

that ‘Alī ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān al-Mu‘āwī said, “ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar
saw me playing with some small pebbles in the prayer. When I
ﬁnished he forbade me [to do that], saying, ‘Do as the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did.’ I asked, ‘What did the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬do?’
90

He replied, ‘When he sat in the prayer, he placed his right hand on
his right thigh and he closed his ﬁst and pointed his index ﬁnger,
and he placed his left hand on his left thigh. at is what he used to
do.’”
52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār that

he had seen ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar praying with a man beside him.
When the man sat in the fourth rak‘a, he put both feet to one side
and crossed them. When ʿAbdullāh ﬁnished, he disapproved of that
to him, and the man protested, “But you do the same.” ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Umar said, “I am ill.”
53 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṣadaqa ibn Yasār that al-

Mughīra ibn Ḥakīm saw ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar sit back from the two
sajdas of the prayer onto the top of his feet. When he had ﬁnished,
al-Mughīra mentioned it to him, and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar
explained, “It is not a sunna of the prayer. I do it because I am ill.”
54 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar told him that he used to see
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar cross his legs in the sitting position of the
prayer. He said, “So I did the same, and I was young at the time.
ʿAbdullah ibn ‘Umar forbade me to do it, saying, ‘e sunna of the
prayer is that you keep your right foot vertical and lay your left foot
down.’ I told him, ‘But you were doing that.’ He answered, ‘My feet
do not support me.’”
55 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad showed them how to sit in the tashahhud,
and he kept his right foot vertical and laid his left foot down, and
sat on his left haunch not on his foot. en he said, “ʿAbdullāh ibn
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar saw me doing this and related to me that his
father used to do the same thing.”

3.13 Tashahhud in the prayer

91

56 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ʿAbd al-Qārī that he heard
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb say, while he was teaching people the
tashahhud from the minbar, “Say, ‘Greetings belong to Allah. Pure
actions belong to Allah. Good words and prayers belong to Allah.
Peace on you, Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings.
Peace be upon us and on the slaves of Allah who are right-acting. I
testify that there is no god except Allah. And I testify that
Muḥammad is His slave and His Messenger.’”
At-tāḥiyyatu lillāh, az-zākiyātu lillāh, aṭ-ṭayyibātu wa’ṣ-ṣalawātu
lillāh. As-salāmu ‘alayka ayyuhā’n-nabiyyu wa raḥmatu’llāhi wa
barakātuhu. As-salāmu ‘alaynā wa ‘alā ‘ibādi’llāhi’ṣ-ṣāliḥīn. Ashhadu an lā ilaha illā’llāh wa ash-hadu anna Muḥammadan ʿabduhu
wa rasulūh.
57 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say the tashahhud saying, “In the Name of Allah.
Greetings belong to Allah. Prayers belong to Allah. Pure actions
belong to Allah. Peace be on the Prophet and the mercy of Allah
and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the slaves of Allah who are
right-acting. I testify that there is no god except Allah. I testify that
Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allah.”
Bismillāh, at-tāḥiyyatu lillāh, aṣ-ṣalawātu lillāh, az-zākiyātu lillāh.
As-salāmu ‘alā’n-nabiyyi wa raḥmatu’llāhi wa barakātuhu. Assalāmu ‘alaynā wa ‘alā ‘ibādi’llāhi’ṣ-ṣāliḥīn. Shahidtu an la ilaha
illallāh. Shahidtu anna Muḥammadan rasūlu’llāh.
He used to say this after the ﬁrst two rak‘as and he would make
supplication with whatever seemed ﬁt to him when the tashahhud
was completed. When he sat at the end of the prayer, he did the
tashahhud in a similar manner, except that after the tashahhud he
made supplication with whatever seemed ﬁt to him. When he had
completed the tashahhud and intended to say the taslīm, he said,
“Peace be on the Prophet and His mercy and blessings. Peace be
upon us and on the slaves of Allah who are right-acting.”
92

“As-salāmu ‘alā’n-nabiyyi wa raḥmatu’llāhi wa barakātuhu. Assalāmu ‘alaynā wa ‘alā ‘ibādi’llāhi’ṣ-ṣāliḥīn.”
He then said, “Peace be upon you” to his right, and would return the
greeting to the imām, and if anyone said “Peace be upon you” from
his left he would return the greeting to him.
58 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥman ibn alQāsim from his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬used

to say in the tashahhud, “Greetings, good words, prayers, pure
actions belong to Allah. I testify that there is no god except Allah,
alone without partner, and that Muḥammad is His slave and His
Messenger. Peace be on you, Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and
His blessings. Peace be on us and on the slaves of Allah who are
right-acting. Peace be upon you.”
“At-tāḥiyyatu, aṭ-ṭayyibātu, aṣ-ṣalawātu, az-zākiyātu lillāh. Ashhadu
an lā ilaha illā’llāh, waḥdahu lā sharīka lah, wa anna Muḥammadan
ʿabduhu wa rasuluhu. As-salāmu ‘alayka ayyuhā’n-nabiyyu wa
raḥmatu’llāhi wa barakātuhu. As-salāmu ‘alaynā wa ‘alā ‘ibādi’llāhi’ṣṣāliḥīn. As-salāmu ‘alaykum.”
59 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd al-Anṣārī

that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad told him that
‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, used to say in the tashahhud,
“Greetings, good words, prayers, pure actions belong to Allah. I
testify that there is no god except Allah, alone without partner, and
I testify that Muḥammad is the slave of Allah and His Messenger.
Peace be upon you, Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His
blessings. Peace be upon us and on the slaves of Allah who are
right-acting. Peace be upon you.”
“At-tāḥiyyatu, aṭ-ṭayyibātu, aṣ-ṣalawātu, az-zākiyātu lillāh. Ashhadu an lā ilaha illā’llāh, waḥdahu lā sharīka lah wa ash-hadu anna
Muḥammadan ʿabduhu wa rasūluhu. As-salāmu ‘alayka ayyuhā’nnabiyyu wa raḥmatu’llāhi wa barakātuhu. As-salāmu ‘alaynā wa ‘alā
‘ibādi’llāhi’ṣ-ṣāliḥīn. As-salāmu ‘alaykum.”
93

60 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he asked Ibn Shihāb and

Nāﬁ‘, the mawlā of Ibn ‘Umar, whether a man who joined an imām
who had already done a rak‘a should say the tashahhud with the
imām in the second and fourth rak‘as, even though these were odd
for him? ey said, “He should say the tashahhud with him.”
Mālik said, “at is the position with us.”

3.14 What to do if one raises one’s head before the imām
61 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn

‘Alqama from Mālik ibn ʿAbdullāh as-Sa‘dī that Abū Hurayra said,
“e forelock of someone who raises his head and lowers it before
the imām is in the hand of a shayṭān.”

Mālik said concerning some one who forgot and raised his head
before the imām in rukū‘ or sujūd, “e sunna of that is to return to
bowing or prostrating and not to wait for the imām to come up.
What he has done is a mistake, because the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘e imām is appointed to be followed, so do not diﬀer with
him.’ Abū Hurayra said, ‘e forelock of someone who raises his
head and lowers it before the imām is in the hand of a shayṭān.’”

3.15 What to do if through forgetfulness one says the taslīm after
two rak‘as
62 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ayyūb ibn Abī Tamīma as-

Sakhtiyānī from Muḥammad ibn Sīrīn from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ﬁnished the prayer after two rak‘as and Dhū
al-Yadayn asked him, “Has the prayer been shortened or did you
forget, Messenger of Allah?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Has
Dhū al-Yadayn spoken the truth?” e people said, “Yes,” and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stood and prayed another two rak‘as and
then said, “Peace be upon you.” en he said, “Allah is greater” and
went into a sajda as long as his usual prostration or longer. en he
came up from sajda and said, “Allah is greater” and went into a sajda
as long as his usual prostration or longer and then came up.
94

63 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwūd ibn al-Ḥuṣayn that

Abū Sufyān, the mawlā of Ibn Abī Aḥmad, said that he heard Abū
Hurayra say, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed ‘Aṣr and said the
taslīm after two rak‘as. Dhū al-Yadayn stood up and said, ‘Has the
prayer been shortened, Messenger of Allah, or did you forget?’ e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stood up and completed what remained of
the prayer, and then, remaining sitting after saying the taslīm, he
made two prostrations.”
64 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Abū Bakr

ibn Sulaymān ibn Abī Ḥathma said, “I have heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed two rak‘as of one of the two day-time
prayers, Ẓuhr or ‘Aṣr, and said the taslīm after two rak‘as. Dhū ashShamālayn asked him, ‘Has the prayer been shortened, Messenger
of Allah, or did you forget?’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘e
prayer has not been shortened and I did not forget.’ Dhū ashShamālayn said, ‘It was certainly one of those, Messenger of Allah.’
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬approached the people and said, ‘Has
Dhū ash-Shamālayn spoken the truth?’ ey replied, ‘Yes,
Messenger of Allah,’ and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬completed
what remained of the prayer, and then said, ‘Peace be upon you.’”
65 Yaḥyā related the same as that to me from Mālik from Ibn

Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab, and from Abū Salama ibn
ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān.
Mālik said, “For every forgetfulness which decreases from the
prayer, prostrations for it are done before the greeting, and for every
forgetfulness which is an addition to the prayer, prostrations are
done for it come after the greeting.”

3.16 Completing what is recalled when uncertain how much has
been prayed
66 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If you are uncertain

in the prayer and do not know whether you have prayed three or
95

four rak‘as, then pray a rak‘a and make two prostrations from the
sitting position before the taslīm. If the rak‘a that you prayed was
the ﬁfth, then you make it even by these two sajdas, and if it was the
fourth, then the two prostrations spite Shayṭān.”
67 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Umar ibn Muḥammad ibn

Zayd from Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to
say, “If you become uncertain in the prayer, estimate what you think
you have forgotten of the prayer and repeat it, then do the two
sajdas of forgetfulness from the sitting position.”
68 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Afīf ibn ‘Amr as-Sahmī

that ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār said, “I asked ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ and
Ka‘b al-Aḥbar about someone who was uncertain in his prayer and
did not know whether he had prayed three or four rak‘as. Both of
them said, ‘He should pray another rak‘a and then do two sajdas
from the sitting position.’”
69 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar, when questioned about forgetfulness in the prayer, said, “If
you think that you have forgotten part of the prayer, then you
should pray it.”

3.17 What to do if one stands after the completion of the prayer
or after two rak‘as
70 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from al-A‘raj
that ʿAbdullāh ibn Buḥayna said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

prayed two rak‘as with us then got up without sitting back and the
people stood with him. When he had ﬁnished the prayer and we
had seen him say the taslīm, he said ‘Allah is greater’ and did two
sajdas from the sitting position and then said the taslīm again.”
71 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ʿAbd

ar-Raḥmān ibn Hurmuz that ʿAbdullāh ibn Buḥayna said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed Ẓuhr with us and he stood straight up
96

after two rak‘as without sitting. When he had ﬁnished the prayer, he
did two sajdas and then said the taslīm after that.”
Mālik said, concerning someone who forgot in his prayer and stood
up after he had completed four rak‘as and recited and then went into
rukū‘ and then, when he raised his head from rukū‘, remembered
that he had already completed (his prayer), “He returns to a sitting
position and does not do any sajda. If he has already done one sajda
I do not think he should do another. en, when his prayer is
ﬁnished, he does two sajdas from the sitting position after saying
the taslīm.”

3.18 Distraction in the prayer
72 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Alqama ibn Abī ‘Alqama
from his mother that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “Abū
Jahm ibn Ḥudhayfa gave the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬a ﬁne striped

garment from Syria and he performed the prayer in it. When he
had ﬁnished he said, ‘Give this garment back to Abū Jahm. I looked
at the stripes in the prayer and they almost distracted me.’”
73 Mālik related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his father that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬wore a ﬁne striped garment from Syria,

and then gave it to Abū Jahm and took a plain, rough, garment in
return. Abū Jahm asked, “Messenger of Allah! Why?” He said, “I
looked at the stripes in the prayer.”
74 Mālik related to me from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr that Abū Ṭalḥa

al-Anṣārī was praying in his garden when a wild pigeon ﬂew in and
began to ﬂy to and fro trying to ﬁnd a way out. e sight was
pleasing to him and he let his eyes follow the bird for a time and
then he went back to his prayer but could not remember how much
he had prayed. He said, “A trial has befallen me in this property of
mine.” So he came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and mentioned the
trial that had happened to him in his garden and said, “Messenger
of Allah, it is a ṣadaqa for Allah, so dispose of it wherever you
wish.”
97

ʿ

75 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

that a man from the Anṣār was praying in a garden of his in Quﬀ,
one of the valleys of Madīna, during the date season and the
branches of the palms were sagging with fruit on all sides. He stared
at their fruitfulness in amazement. en he went back to his prayer
and he did not know how much he had prayed. He said, “A trial has
befallen me in this property of mine.” So he went to ‘Uthmān ibn
‘Aﬀān, who was the khalīfa at the time, and mentioned it to him
and said, “It is ṣadaqa, so give it away in the paths of good.”
‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān sold it for ﬁfty thousand and so that property
became known as the Fifty.

98

4. Forgetfulness in the Prayer
4.1 What to do if one forgets in prayer
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū

Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When one of you stands in prayer,
Shayṭān comes to him and confuses him until he does not know
how much he has prayed. When one of you experiences that, he
should do two sajdas from the sitting position.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I forget, or I am made to forget, in

order that I may establish the sunna.”

3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that a man

questioned al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad saying, “My imagination gets
carried away in the prayer, and that happens to me a lot.” Al-Qāsim
ibn Muḥammad said, “Go on with your prayer, for it will not leave
you alone until you go away saying, ‘I have not completed my
prayer.’”

99

5. Jumu‘a
5.1 Ghusl on the day of jumu‘a
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān, from Abū Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If someone does
ghusl for major ritual impurity (janāba) on the day of jumu‘a and
then goes to the prayer in the ﬁrst part of the time, it is as if he has
oﬀered up a camel. If he goes in the second part of the time, it is as
if he has oﬀered up a cow. If he goes in third part of the time, it is as
if he has oﬀered up a horned ram. If he goes in the fourth part of
the time, it is as if he has oﬀered up a hen. If he goes in the ﬁfth
part of the time, it is as if he has oﬀered up an egg. And when the
imām comes out, the angels settle down listening to the dhikr
(remembrance of Allah).”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sa‘īd ibn Abī Sa‘īd al-

Maqburī that Abū Hurayra used to say, “Doing ghusl as prescribed
for major ritual impurity (janāba) on the day of jumu‘a is incumbent
(wājib) on every male who has reached puberty.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh said, “One of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬came into the mosque on the day of jumu‘a while ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb was already giving the khuṭba. ‘Umar asked, ‘What (kind
of ) time is this (to arrive)?’ He replied, ‘Amīr al-Mu’minīn, I
returned from the market and heard the call to prayer, so I did no
more than do wuḍū’.’ ‘Umar said, ‘You only did wuḍū’ as well? You
know that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to instruct people to do
ghusl.’”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṣafwān ibn Sulaym from

‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār from Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī that the Messenger of

100

Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Ghusl on the day of jumu‘a is incumbent on every
male who has reached puberty.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Ibn ‘Umar that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When one of you goes to jumu‘a,

perform ghusl.”

Mālik said, “It is not enough for someone to have a ghusl on the day
of jumu‘a and intend by it the ghusl for jumu‘a unless he does ghusl
and then sets oﬀ. at is because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said in
the ḥadīth related by Ibn ‘Umar, ‘When one of you goes to jumu‘a,
perform ghusl.’”
Mālik said, “If someone does ghusl on the day of jumu‘a and intends
by it the ghusl of the day of jumu‘a and then sets out, whether early
or late, and does something which breaks his wuḍū’, he only has to
perform wuḍū’ and his ghusl remains valid for him.”

5.2 Paying attention when the imām is giving the khuṭba on the
day of jumu‘a
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Even

saying to your companion ‘Listen’ while the imām is giving the
khuṭba on the day of jumu‘a constitutes foolish chatter.”

7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that a‘laba

ibn Abī Mālik al-Quraẓī informed him that in the time of ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb they used to pray on the day of jumu‘a until ‘Umar
came out, and when ‘Umar came out and sat on the minbar and the
mu’adhdhins called the adhān, they would sit and talk, and then
when the mu’adhdhins were silent and ‘Umar stood to give the
khuṭba, they would pay attention and no one would speak.
Ibn Shihāb said, “e imām coming out stops prayer and his
speaking stops conversation.”

101

8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from Mālik ibn Abī ‘Āmir that ‘Uthmān ibn
‘Aﬀān used to say in khuṭbas, and he would seldom omit it if he was
giving the khuṭba, “When the imām stands to deliver the khuṭba on
the day of jumu‘a, listen and pay attention, for there is the same
portion for someone who pays attention but cannot hear as for
someone who pays attention and hears. And when the iqāma of the
prayer is called, straighten your rows and make your shoulders
adjacent to each other, because the straightening of the rows is part
of the completion of the prayer.” en he would not say the takbīr
until some men who had been entrusted with straightening the rows
came and told him that they were straight. en he would say the
takbīr.
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar saw two men talking while the imām was giving the khuṭba
on the day of jumu‘a and he threw pebbles at them to alert them to
be quiet.
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that a man

sneezed on the day of jumu‘a while the imām was giving the khuṭba,
and a man by his side asked Allah to bless him. Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab was asked about that and disapproved of what the man
had done and said, “Do not do it again.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that when he asked Ibn Shihāb

about talking in the jumu‘a after the imām had come down from the
minbar but before he had said the takbīr Ibn Shihāb said, “ere is
no harm in that.”

5.3 Catching a rak‘a of the jumu‘a prayer
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb used to say,

“Someone who catches a rak‘a of the jumu‘a prayer should pray
another rak‘a with it.” Ibn Shihāb said, “at is the sunna.”

102

Mālik said, “I saw the people of knowledge in our city doing that.
at is because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Whoever catches a
rak‘a of the prayer has caught the prayer.’”
Mālik said concerning someone who was in a crowd on the day of
jumu‘a and did the rukū‘ but was not able to go into sajda until the
imām had risen or ﬁnished his prayer, “If he is able to do the sajda
and has already done the rukū‘ then he should do the sajda when the
people stand up. If he is unable to do the sajda until after the imām
has ﬁnished the prayer, then I prefer that he begins the prayer again
and does the four rak‘as of Ẓuhr.”

5.4 Nose-bleeds on the day of jumu‘a
13 Mālik said, “If someone has a nosebleed on the day of jumu‘a

while the imām is giving the khuṭba and leaves and does not come
back until the imām has ﬁnished the prayer, he should pray four
rak‘as.”

Mālik said that if someone prayed a rak‘a with the imām on the day
of jumu‘a and then his nose started to bleed so he left and came
back and found that the imām had prayed both rak‘as, he should
then complete the prayer with a second rak‘a as long as he had not
spoken.
Mālik said, “Someone who has a nosebleed or something else
happen to him that forces him to leave does not have to ask
permission of the imām if he wants to leave on the day of jumu‘a.”

5.5 Making haste on the day of jumu‘a
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had asked Ibn Shihāb

about the words of Allah, the Majestic, the Mighty, “O you who
believe! When the prayer is called on the Day of jumu‘a, hasten to
the remembrance of Allah” (62:9). Ibn Shihāb said, “‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb used to recite, ‘When the call is made for the prayer on the
day of jumu‘a, go to the remembrance of Allah.’”
103

Mālik said, “Making haste in the Book of Allah is only deed and
action. Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, says ‘When he leaves you, he
goes about the earth’ (2:205), and He, the Exalted, said, ‘But as for
him who comes to you eagerly showing fearfulness’ (80:8-9), and He
said, ‘en he hastily backed away’ (79:22), and He said, ‘ere is a
vast diﬀerence in your striving’” (92:4).
Mālik said, “us the making haste which Allah mentions in His
Book is not running on the feet or exertion. It only means deed and
actions.”

5.6 e Imām’s stopping oﬀ in a town on the day of jumu‘a
15 Mālik said, “If the Imām stops oﬀ on a journey in a settlement

where jumu‘a is obligatory and he gives a khuṭba and leads them in
the jumu‘a prayer, then the people of the town and any other people
present perform the jumu‘a prayer with him.”
Mālik said, “If the Imām gathers people for prayer while he is
travelling in a settlement where the jumu‘a prayer is not obligatory,
then there is no jumu‘a for him, nor for the people of the town, nor
for anyone else who joins them for the prayer in congregation, and
the people of the settlement and anyone else who is not travelling
should perform the full prayer.”
Mālik added, “jumu‘a is not obligatory for a traveller.”

5.7 e special time in the day of jumu‘a
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬mentioned

the day of jumu‘a and said, “ere is a time in it when Allah gives to
a Muslim standing in prayer whatever he asks for,” and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬indicated with his hand how small it was.
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn al-

Hād from Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Hārith at-Taymī from
Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf that Abū Hurayra said,
104

“I went out to aṭ-Ṭūr (Mount Sinai) and met Ka‘b al-Ahbar and sat
with him. He related to me things from the Torah and I related to
him things from the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. Among the things I
related to him was that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘e best of
days on which the sun rises is the day of jumu‘a. On it Adam was
created, and on it he fell from the Garden. On it he was forgiven,
and on it he died. On it the Final Hour will take place, and every
moving thing listens from morning till the sun disappears in
apprehension of the Final Hour except jinn and men. During it
there is a time when Allah gives to a Muslim slave standing in
prayer whatever he asks for.’ Ka‘b said, ‘at is one day in every
year.’ I said, ‘No, rather every jumu‘a.’ en Ka‘b recited the Torah
and said, ‘e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬has spoken the truth.’”
Abū Hurayra continued, “I met Baṣra ibn Abī Baṣra al-Ghifārī and
he asked, ‘Where have you come from?’ I replied, ‘From aṭ-Ṭūr.’ He
said, ‘If I had seen you before you left, you would not have gone. I
heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, “Only make a special journey
to three mosques: the mosque of the Ḥaram (Makka), this mosque
(Madīna), and the mosque of Ilyā’ or the Bait al-Maqdis (two
names of Jerusalem).”’” (He was not sure which expression was
used.)
Abū Hurayra continued, “en I met ʿAbdullāh ibn Salām and I
told him that I had sat with Ka‘b al-Aḥbar, and I mentioned what I
had related to him about the day of jumu‘a, and told him that Ka‘b
had said, ‘at is one day in every year.’ ʿAbdullāh ibn Salām said,
‘Ka‘b lied,’ and I added, ‘Ka‘b then recited the Torah and said, “No,
it is every jumu‘a.”’ ʿAbdullāh ibn Salām said, ‘Ka‘b spoke the truth.’
en ʿAbdullāh ibn Salām said, ‘I know what time that is.’”
Abū Hurayra continued, “I said to him, ‘Let me know it – do not
keep it from me.’ ʿAbdullāh ibn Salām said, ‘It is the last period of
time in the day of jumu‘a.’”
Abū Hurayra continued, “I asked, ‘How can it be the last period of
time in the day of jumu‘a, when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “a
105

Muslim standing in prayer”, and that is a time when there is no
prayer?’ ʿAbdullāh ibn Salām replied, ‘Did not the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, “Whoever sits waiting for the prayer is in prayer until
he prays?’”
Abū Hurayra added, “I said, ‘Of course.’ He said, ‘en it is that.’”

5.8 Good appearance and not stepping over people and facing the
imām on the day of jumu‘a
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he had
heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere is nothing wrong

in wearing two garments which are not work-clothes for jumu‘a.”

19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar would never go to jumu‘a without wearing oil and perfume
except when it was forbidden (i.e. when he was in iḥrām).

20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn

Abī Bakr ibn Ḥazm from whoever related it to him that Abū
Hurayra used to say, “It is better for a man to pray on the surface of
al-Ḥarra (a rocky area in Madīna) than for him to wait until the
imām stands to give the khuṭba and then come and step over
people’s necks.”
Mālik said, “e sunna with us is that the people face the imām on
the day of jumu‘a when he intends to give the khuṭba, whether they
are near the qibla or elsewhere.”

5.9 e recitation in the jumu‘a prayer, the sitting, and missing
the prayer without a reason
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḍamra ibn Sa‘īd al-Māzinī

from ‘Ubaydullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd that aḍḌaḥḥāk ibn Qays asked an-Nu‘mān ibn Bashīr, “What did the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to recite on the day of jumu‘a after
Sūrat al-jumu‘a (sūra 62)?” He said, “He used to recite Sūrat alGhāshiya (sūra 88).”
106

22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ṣafwān ibn Sulaym said, “If

anyone misses jumu‘a three times without reason or illness, Allah
will set a seal on his heart.” Mālik said, “I do not know if it was
from the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬or not.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave two khuṭbas on the

day of jumu‘a and sat down between them.

107

6. Prayer in Ramadan
6.1 Stimulation of the desire for prayer in Ramaḍān
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn
az-Zubayr from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed in the mosque one night and people

prayed behind him. en he prayed the next night and there were
more people. en they gathered on the third or fourth night and
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did not come out to them. In the
morning, he said, “I saw what you were doing and the only thing
that prevented me from coming out to you was that I feared that it
would become obligatory (farḍ) for you.” is happened in
Ramaḍān.
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū

Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to exhort people to spend the night in
prayer in Ramaḍān but never gave a deﬁnite order to do it. He used
to say, “Anyone who stands in prayer in the night during Ramaḍān
with belief and expecting the reward will be forgiven all his previous
wrong actions.”
Ibn Shihāb said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬died while that was
still the custom, and it continued to be the custom in the khalifate
of Abū Bakr and at the beginning of the khalifate of ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb.”

6.2 Praying at night during Ramaḍān
3 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr

that ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ʿAbd al-Qārī said, “I went out with
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb in Ramaḍān to the mosque and found the
people there were spread out in groups. Some men were praying by
themselves, whilst others were praying in small groups. ‘Umar said,
108

‘By Allah, I think that it would be better for all these people to join
together behind one reciter.’ So he gathered them behind Ubayy ibn
Ka‘b. en I went out with him another night and the people were
praying behind their Qur’ān reciter. ‘Umar said, ‘is is an excellent
innovation! But the one they sleep through is better than the one
they are praying,’ meaning the last part of the night, and people
used to pray at the beginning of the night.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Yūsuf that

as-Sā’ib ibn Yazīd said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb ordered Ubayy ibn
Ka‘b and Tamīm ad-Dārī to lead the people in praying eleven rak’as.
e reciter of the Qur’ān would recite the Mi’īn (a group of
medium-sized sūras) until we would be leaning on our staﬀs on
account of having stood so long in prayer. And we would not leave
until the approach of dawn.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yazīd ibn Rūmān said, “e

people used to pray twenty-three rak‘as at night during Ramaḍān in
the time of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb.”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwūd ibn al-Ḥusayn that

he heard al-A‘raj say, “I never saw the people in Ramaḍān but that
they were cursing the disbelievers.” He added, “e reciter of
Qur’ān used to recite Sūrat al-Baqara in eight rak‘as and if he did it
in twelve rak‘as the people would think that he had made it easy.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr said,

“I heard my father say, ‘We ﬁnished praying in Ramaḍān and the
servants hurried with the food, fearing the approach of dawn.’”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his

father that Dhakwān Abū ‘Amr (a slave belonging to ‘Ā’isha, the
wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, who was freed by her after her death) used
to stand in prayer and recite for her in Ramaḍān.

109

7. Tahajjud
7.1 Concerning prayer in the night
1 Yaḥyā

related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn alMunkadir from Sa‘īd ibn al-Jubayr that a man who has his approval
(as a relater of ḥadīth), told him that ‘A’isha, the wife of the Prophet
‫ ﷺ‬said, “If a man prays in the night and sleep overcomes him
during it, Allah writes for him the reward of his prayer, and his
sleep is ṣadaqa for him.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydillāh, from Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that
‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I used to sleep directly in
front of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and my legs were in his qibla.
When he prostrated, he would nudge me and I would pull up my
legs. When he stood up, I stretched them out again.” She added, “In
those days there were no lamps in the houses.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his
father from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When one of you nods oﬀ while he is praying, he

should go and lie down until he is no longer sleepy. If someone
prays when he is drowsy, he may not know whether he is asking for
forgiveness or asking for something bad for himself.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ismā‘īl from Ibn Abī Ḥakīm
that he had heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬heard a woman

praying at night. He asked, “Who is that?” and someone told him,
“It is al-Ḥawlā’ bint Tuwayt. She does not sleep in the night.” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬disapproved of that and his disapproval
showed in his face. en he said, “Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,
does not become weary, but you become weary. Take on whatever is
within your capability.”

110

YA 5 ḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from his
father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to pray as much as Allah
willed in the night until he would wake his family at the end of the
night for the prayer. He used to say to them, “e prayer, the
prayer.” en he would recite the āyat, “Command your family to
pray, and be constant in it. We do not ask you for provision. We
provide for you. And the best end result is gained by taqwā.” (20:132)
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab used to say, “Sleep is disapproved of before ‘Ishā’ as is
con-versation after it.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar used to say, “(Voluntary) prayers, whether in the day or
the night, are done two at a time with a taslīm after every pair of
rak‘as.”
Mālik said, “at is the custom among us.”

7.2 How the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬prayed the witr
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn
az-Zubayr from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray eleven rak‘as in the night,

making them odd with a single one, and when he had ﬁnished he
lay down on his right side.
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sa‘īd ibn Abī Sa‘īd al-

Maqburī from Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf that he
asked ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, what the prayer of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was like during Ramadān. She said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did not exceed eleven rak‘as in Ramadan or
at any other time. He prayed four – do not ask me about their
beauty or length. en he prayed another four – do not ask me
about their beauty and length. en he prayed three.”
‘Ā’isha continued, “I said, ‘Messenger of Allah, do you sleep before
you do the witr?’ He said, ‘‘Ā’isha, my eyes sleep but my heart does
111

not sleep.’”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mūminīn said, “e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray thirteen rak‘as in the night and then would
pray two rak‘as when he heard the adhān for the Ṣubḥ prayer.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Makhrama ibn Sulaymān

from Kurayb, the mawlā of Ibn ‘Abbās, that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās
told him that he had spent a night at the house of Maymūna, the
wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, who was also Ibn ‘Abbās’s mother’s sister.
Ibn ‘Abbās said, “I lay down with my head on the breadth of the
cushion, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and his wife lay down with
their heads on its length. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬slept, until,
halfway through the night or a little before or after it, he awoke and
sat up and wiped the sleep away from his face with his hand. en
he recited the last ten āyats of Sūra Āl ‘Imrān (sūra 3). en he got
up and went over to a water-skin which was hanging up and did
wuḍū’ from it, doing his wuḍū’ thoroughly, and then he stood in
prayer.”
Ibn ‘Abbās continued, “I stood up and did the same and then went
and stood by his side. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬put his right hand
on my head and took my right ear and tweaked it. He prayed two
rak‘as, then two rak‘as, then two rak‘as, then two rak‘as, then two
rak‘as, then two rak‘as, and then prayed an odd rak‘a. en he lay
down until the mu’adhdhin came to him, and then prayed two quick
rak‘as, and went out and prayed Ṣubḥ.”
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

from his father that ʿAbdullāh ibn Qays ibn Makhrama told him
that Zayd ibn Khālid al-Juhanī said one night that he had gone to
observe the prayer of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. He said, “I rested
my head on his threshold. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬got up and
prayed two long, long, long rak‘as. en he prayed two rak‘as which
were slightly less long than the two before them. en he prayed
two rak‘as which were slightly less long than the two before them.
112

en he prayed two rak‘as which were slightly less long than the two
before them. en he prayed two rak‘as which were slightly less long
than the two before them. en he prayed two rak‘as which were
slightly less long than the two before them. en he prayed an odd
rak‘a, making thirteen rak‘as in all.”

7.3 e command to pray the witr
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ and ʿAbdullāh ibn

Dīnār from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that a man asked the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about night prayers. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“Night prayers are done two by two, and when you are afraid that
dawn is approaching, then pray one rak‘at as witr to make what you
have prayed odd.”
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥibbān from Ibn Muḥayriz that a man
from the Kināna tribe called al-Mukhdajī heard a man in Syria
known as Abū Muḥammad saying, “e witr is obligatory (farḍ).”
Al-Mukhdajī said, “I went to ‘Ubāda ibn aṣ-Ṣāmit and presented
myself to him as he was going to the mosque, and told him what
Abū Muḥammad had said. ‘Ubāda said that Abū Muḥammad had
lied and that he had heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘Allah the
Majestic and Mighty has written ﬁve prayers for mankind, and
whoever does them and does not waste anything of them by making
light of what is due to them, there is a pact for him with Allah that
He will admit him into the Garden. Whoever does not do them,
there is no pact for him with Allah. If He wishes, He punishes him,
and if He wishes, He admits him into the Garden.’”
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Bakr ibn ‘Umar that

Sa‘īd ibn Yasār said, “I was travelling with ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar on
the road to Makka, and fearing that it was nearly dawn I
dismounted, prayed the witr and then caught up with him.
ʿAbdullāh said, ‘Do you not have a good enough example in the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ’?ﷺ‬I said, ‘Of course, by Allah!’ He said, ‘e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray the witr on his camel.’”
113

16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab said, “Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq used to pray the witr
when he wished to go to bed, and ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to pray
the witr at the end of the night. As for me, I pray the witr when I go
to bed.”
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that a man

asked ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar whether the witr was obligatory and
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar replied, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed
the witr, and the Muslims prayed the witr.” e man began
repeating his question, and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar kept saying, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed the witr, and the Muslims prayed the
witr.”
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Ā’isha,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, used to say, “If someone fears that he

will sleep through till the morning, let him pray the witr before he
goes to sleep, and if someone hopes to wake for the last part of the
night, let him delay his witr.”

19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Nāﬁ‘ said, “I was with

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar in Makka. e sky was clouded over and
ʿAbdullāh was worried that dawn was approaching so he prayed one
rak‘a for witr. en the clouds cleared and he saw that it was still
night, so he made his prayers even by praying one rak‘a. en he
continued to pray two rak‘as at a time until, fearing that dawn was
approaching, he prayed one rak‘a for witr.”
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say the taslīm between the two rak‘as and the one
rak‘a of witr so that he could ask for something he needed.
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘d ibn

Abī Waqqāṣ used to pray witr after ‘Ishā’ with one rak‘a.

Mālik said, “is is not the practice with us. Rather three is the
minimum for witr.”
114

ʿ

22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār that

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to say, “e Maghrib prayer is the witr of
the daytime prayers.”

Mālik said, “If someone prays the witr at the beginning of the night
and goes to sleep and then wakes up and it seems good to him to
pray, let him pray two rak‘as at a time. at is what I like most of
what I have heard.”

7.4 Praying the witr after the break of dawn
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd al-Karīm ibn Abī al-

Mukhāriq al-Baṣrī from Sa‘īd ibn Jubayr that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbas
went to sleep, and when he woke up, he said to his servant, “Go and
see what the people have done,” (by that time his sight had gone.)
e servant went out and returned saying, “e people have left
from Ṣubḥ,” so ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās got up and prayed the witr and
then prayed Ṣubḥ.
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Abbās and ‘Ubāda ibn aṣ-Ṣāmit and al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad
and ‘Ābdullāh ibn ‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a had all prayed the witr after the
break of dawn.
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that ʿAbdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd said, “I do not mind if the
iqāma for the Ṣubḥ prayer is called while I am still praying the witr.”
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said,

“‘Ubāda ibn aṣ-Ṣāmit used to lead the people in prayer. One day he
came out for Ṣubḥ and the mu’adhdhin began to give the iqāma for
the Ṣubḥ prayer. ‘Ubāda silenced him, prayed the witr and then led
them in Ṣubḥ.”
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim said, “I heard ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a say, ‘I
sometimes pray the witr while hearing the iqāma or after the break
of dawn.’” ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān was not certain which he said.
ʿ
115

28 Mālik related to me that ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Qāsim heard

his father al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad say, “I have prayed the witr
after dawn.”
Mālik said, “Only a person who oversleeps so that he has not done
the witr prays it after dawn. No one should intentionally do his witr
after dawn.”

7.5 e two rak‘as of Fajr
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that Hafṣa, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬told him that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray two quick rak‘as after the

mu’adhdhin had ﬁnished the adhān for the Ṣubḥ prayer before the
iqāma was said for the prayer.

30 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of
the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray the

two rak‘as of the dawn (fajr) so quickly that I would ask myself
whether he had recited the Umm al-Qur’ān or not.’”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sharīk ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn

Abī Namir that Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān said, “Some
people heard the iqāma and started to pray. e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬came out and said, ‘Are you doing two prayers at the same time?
Are you doing two prayers at the same time?’ at was about the
Ṣubḥ prayer and the two rak‘as before Ṣubḥ.”
“Are you doing two prayers at the same time?” Al-Bājī said that this
is an objection and rebuke.
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar missed the two rak‘as of dawn and then prayed them after
the sun had risen.

116

ʿ

33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥman ibn al-

Qāsim that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad had done the same as Ibn
‘Umar.

117

8. Prayer in Congregation
8.1 e superiority of prayer in congregation over prayer alone
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Prayer in a group is

twenty-seven times better than the prayer of a man by himself.”

2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

said, “Prayer in a group is twenty-ﬁve degrees times better than the
prayer of one of you on his own.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “By Him in

Whose hand my soul is, I seriously considered ordering someone to
collect ﬁrewood, ordering the prayer be called, appointing a man to
lead the prayer and then coming up behind certain men and burning
their houses down about them! By Him in whose hand my soul is, if
any of them had known they would ﬁnd a meaty bone or two good
hooves, they would have attended ‘Ishā’.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from Busr ibn Sa‘īd that Zayd ibn ābit
said, “e most excellent prayer is your prayer in your house, except
for the prescribed prayers.”

8.2 e ‘Ishā’ and Ṣubḥ prayers
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn

Ḥarmala al-Aslamī from Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “What separates us from the hypocrites is being
present at ‘Ishā’ and Ṣubḥ. ey cannot do it,” or words to that
eﬀect.
118

6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān from Abū Ṣāliḥ from Abū Hurayra that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If a man who is walking along a
road ﬁnds a branch of thorns on the road and removes it, Allah
thanks him for doing that and forgives him.”
He also said, “ere are ﬁve categories who are considered martyrs:
someone killed by a plague, someone killed by a disease of the belly,
someone who drowns, someone killed by a collapsing building and
the one who is martyred in the Path of Allah.”
He also said, “If people knew what there was in the call to prayer
and the ﬁrst row, and they could ﬁnd no other way except to draw
lots for it, they would draw lots for it. And if they knew what there
was in performing Ẓuhr at its time, they would race each other to it.
And if they knew what there was in the prayers of ‘Ishā’ and Ṣubḥ,
they would come to them even if they had to crawl.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū Bakr

ibn Sulaymān ibn Abī Ḥathma that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb missed
Sulaymān ibn Abī Ḥathma in the Ṣubḥ prayer. In the morning he
went to the market, and Sulaymān’s house was between the market
and the Prophet’s mosque. He passed ash-Shifā’, Sulaymān’s
mother, and said to her, “I did not see Sulaymān at Ṣubḥ.” She
replied, “He spent the night in prayer and sleep overcame him.”
‘Umar said, “I would rather be present at Ṣubḥ than stand the whole
night in prayer.”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm that ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī ‘Amra alAnṣārī said that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān came to the ‘Ishā’ prayer and,
seeing only a few people in the mosque, he lay down at the back of
the mosque to wait for the number of people to increase. Ibn Abī
‘Amra went and sat down beside him and ‘Uthmān asked him who
he was, so he told him. ‘Uthmān said, “What have you memorised
of the Qur’ān?” and he told him. ‘Uthmān said, “If someone is
present at ‘Ishā’, it is as if he had stood in prayer for half a night,
119

and if someone is present at Ṣubḥ, it is as if he had stood in prayer
for a whole night.”

8.3 Repeating the prayer with the imām
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from a man

of the Banū ad-Dīl called Busr ibn Miḥjan from his father, Miḥjan,
that he was in a gathering with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬when the
call to prayer was made. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬rose and prayed
and then returned. Miḥjan remained sitting and did not pray with
him. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked, “What prevented you from
praying with the people? Are you not a Muslim?” He replied, “Of
course, Messenger of Allah, but I have already prayed with my
family.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When you come, pray
with the people even if you have prayed already.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that a man asked

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar, “Sometimes I pray in my house and then
catch the prayer with the imām, should I pray with him?” ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Umar said to him, “Yes,” and the man said, “Which of them do
I make my prayer?” ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “Is that up to you? It
is up to Allah. He will decide on whichever of them He wishes.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that a man

asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab, “I pray in my house and then I come
to the mosque and ﬁnd the imām praying, should I pray with him?”
Sa‘īd answered, “Yes”, and the man said, “Which of them is my
prayer?” Sa‘īd replied, “Are you the one to decide that? at is up to
Allah.”
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Afīf as-Sahmī that a man

from the tribe of Banū Asad asked Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī,
“Sometimes I pray in my house and then come to the mosque and
ﬁnd the imām praying, should I pray with him?” Abū Ayyūb said,
“Yes, pray with him, for someone who does so has the reward of the
group or the equivalent of the reward of the group.”

120

ʿ

13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Someone who prays Maghrib or Ṣubḥ and then
catches them with the imām should not repeat them.”

Mālik said, “I do not see any harm in someone who has already
prayed in his house praying with the imām, except for Maghrib,
because if he repeats it, he makes it even.”

8.4 Praying in a group of people
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“When you lead people in the prayer, make it short, because there
are among them some people who are weak, ill and old. But when
you pray on your own, make it as long as you wish.”

15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Nāﬁ‘ said, “I stood behind

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar in one of the prayers when there was no one
else with him, and he reached behind with his hand and placed me
beside him.”
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that a man

used to lead the people in prayer in al-‘Aqīq (a place near Madīna),
and ‘Umar ibn ʿAbd al-‘Azīz sent a message to him forbidding him
to do so.
Mālik said, “He only forbade him because his father was not
known.”

8.5 Prayer behind an imām when he prays sitting
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Anas ibn
Mālik that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬fell oﬀ his horse when riding,

and his right side was grazed, so he did one of the prayers sitting,
and we prayed behind him sitting. When he left he said, “e imām
is appointed to be followed. If he prays standing, then pray
standing, and when he goes into rukū‘, go into rukū‘, and when he
rises, rise, and when he says, ‘Allah hears whoever praises him,’ say,
121

‘Our Lord, praise belongs to You’, and if he prays sitting, then all of
you pray sitting.”
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed while he was ill, he prayed sitting;

some people prayed behind him standing, and he indicated to them
to sit down. When he ﬁnished, he said, ‘e imām is only
appointed to be followed. When he goes into rukū‘, go into rukū‘
and when he rises, rise and if he prays sitting, pray sitting.’”

19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came out during his illness

and found Abū Bakr standing, leading the people in prayer. Abū
Bakr began to move back, but the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬indicated
to him to stay where he was. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sat by the
side of Abū Bakr, and Abū Bakr prayed following the prayer of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬who was sitting, and the people prayed
following the prayer of Abū Bakr.

8.6 e excellence of prayer standing over prayer sitting
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ismā‘īl ibn Muḥammad ibn

Sa‘īd ibn Abī Waqqās from a mawlā of ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ or of
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Ās that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“e prayer of one of you sitting down is only equal to half the
prayer of one of you when he is standing.”
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ said, “When we arrived at Madīna we were
struck down by a severe epidemic which debilitated us greatly. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came out to the people while they were
praying nawāﬁl prayers sitting down. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘e prayer of the one sitting is equal to only half the prayer of
the one standing.’”

(

8.7 Praying voluntary prayers (nawāﬁl)
22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from as-Sā‘ib

ibn Yazīd from al-Muṭṭalib ibn Abī Wadā‘a as-Sahmī that Ḥafṣa,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “I never saw the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬praying nawāﬁl prayers sitting until a year before his death,
when he began to pray them sitting. He would recite the sūra with a
measured slowness so that it would seem to be longer than other
sūras which were actually longer than it.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, told him that she
had never seen the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬doing night prayers

sitting down until he was getting on in years. He would recite
sitting down until when he wanted to go into rukū‘, he would stand
up and recite about thirty or forty āyats and then go into rukū‘.

24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Yazīd al-

Madanī and from Abū an-Naḍr from Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd arRaḥmān from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray sitting. He would recite sitting,
and then, when about thirty or forty āyats of what he was reciting
remained, he would stand up and recite standing and then go into
rukū‘ and sajda. He would do the same in the second rak‘a.
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr and Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab used to pray voluntary prayers
sitting.

8.8 e middle prayer
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from al-

Qa‘qā‘ ibn Ḥakīm that Abū Yūnus, the mawlā of ‘Ā’isha, Umm alMūminīn, said, “‘Ā’isha ordered me to write out a Qur’ān for her.
She said, ‘When you reach this āyat, let me know: “Safeguard the
prayer – especially the middle prayer. Stand in obedience to Allah.”’
When I reached it I told her, and she dictated to me, ‘Safeguard the
123

prayer – especially the middle prayer and the ‘Aṣr prayer. Stand in
obedience to Allah.’ ‘Ā’isha said, ‘I heard it from the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬.’”
Y 27 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that ‘Amr
ibn Rāﬁ‘ said, “I was writing out a Qur’ān for Ḥafṣa, Umm alMūminīn, and she said, ‘When you reach this āyat, let me know,
“Safeguard the prayer – especially the middle prayer. Stand in
obedience to Allah.” (2:238)’ When I reached it I told her and she
dictated to me, ‘Safeguard the prayer – especially the middle prayer
and the ‘Aṣr prayer. Stand in obedience to Allah.’”
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwūd ibn al-Ḥuṣayn that

Ibn Yarbū‘ al-Makhzūmī said, “I heard Zayd ibn ābit say, ‘e
middle prayer is the Ẓuhr prayer.”’
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Alī ibn

Abī Ṭālib and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās used to say, “e middle prayer
is the Ṣubḥ prayer.”
Mālik said, “Out of all that I have heard about the matter, I prefer
what ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said.”

8.9 Permission to pray in one garment
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that ‘Umar ibn Abī Salama saw the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬praying in one garment in the house of Umm Salama. He was
completely covered by it, and had put both ends crossed over his
shoulders.
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab from Abū Hurayra that someone asked the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about praying in one garment and the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do you all have two garments?”

32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab said that Abū Hurayra was asked, “May a man pray in
124

one garment?” “Yes,” he replied. e man then asked him, “Do you
do that?” and he answered, “Yes, I pray in one garment while my
clothes are on the clothes-rack.”
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Jābir ibn

ʿAbdullāh used to pray in one garment.

34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān that Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm used to pray in a
single long shirt.

35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard from Jābir ibn
ʿAbdullāh that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Let anyone who

cannot ﬁnd two garments pray in one garment and wrap himself in
it, and if the garment is short, let him wrap it around his waist.”
Mālik said, “In my view it is preferable for someone who prays in a
single shirt to put a garment or a turban over his shoulders.”

8.10 Permission for a woman to pray in a shift and head-covering
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Ā’isha,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray in a shift and head-covering.
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Zayd ibn

Qunfudh that his mother asked Umm Salama, the wife of the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, what clothes a woman could wear in the prayer. She
answered, “She can pray in a shift that reaches down and covers the
top of her feet.”
38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from a reliable source from

Bukayr ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Ashajj from Busr ibn Sa‘īd that when
‘Ubaydullāh ibn al-Aswad al-Khawlānī was in the room of
Maymūna, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, she used to pray in a shift
and head-covering, without a waist-wrapper.
39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that a woman asked him for a decision, saying, “Waist125

wrappers are painful to me. Can I pray in a shift and headcovering?” He replied, “Yes, if the shift is long.”

126

9. Shortening the Prayer
9.1 Joining two prayers when settled and when travelling
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwūd ibn al-Huṣayn from
al-A‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬joined

the Ẓuhr and ‘Aṣr prayers on his journey to Tabūk.

2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

from Abū aṭ-Ṭufayl ‘Āmir ibn Wāthila that Mu‘ādh ibn Jabal told
him that they went out with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in the year
of Tabūk, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬joined Ẓuhr with ‘Aṣr and
Maghrib with ‘Ishā’. Mu‘ādh said, “One day he delayed the prayer
and then came out and prayed Ẓuhr and ‘Aṣr together. en he said,
‘Tomorrow, Allah willing, you will reach the spring of Tabūk. But
you will not get there until well into the morning. No one who
arrives should touch any of its water until I arrive.’ We reached it
and found that two men had got to it before us and the spring was
dripping with only a little water. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked
them, ‘Have you touched any of its water?’ ey said, ‘Yes.’ e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬upbraided them and said what Allah wished
him to say. en they took water with their hands from the spring
little by little until it had been collected in something. en the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬washed his face and hands in it. en he put
it back into the spring and the spring ﬂowed with an abundance of
water and the people drew water from it. e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘If you live long enough, Mu‘ādh, you will see this place
ﬁlled with gardens.’”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to join Maghrib and

‘Ishā’ together when he was in a hurry to travel.”

4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

from Sa‘īd ibn Jubayr that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said, “e
127

Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed Ẓuhr and ‘Aṣr together and Maghrib
and ‘Ishā’ together, and not out of fear nor because of travelling.”
Mālik said, “I believe that was during rain.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to join the prayer behind the governors if they joined
Maghrib and ‘Ishā’ in the rain.
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that he had

asked Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh, “Can you join Ẓuhr and ‘Aṣr when
travelling?” He answered, “Yes, there is no harm in doing that. Have
you not seen the people praying at ‘Arafa?”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Alī ibn
Ḥusayn used to say, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬would join Ẓuhr

and ‘Aṣr if he wished to travel the same day, and he would join
Maghrib and ‘Ishā’ if he wished to travel the same night.”

9.2 Shortening the prayer in travel
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from a man of

the family of Khālid ibn Asīd who said to ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar,
“Abū ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān, we ﬁnd the Fear Prayer and the prayer when
resident mentioned in the Qur’ān, but we do not ﬁnd any mention
of the travelling prayer in it.” Ibn ‘Umar said, “Son of my brother!
Allah the Mighty and Majestic sent us Muḥammad ‫ ﷺ‬and we knew
nothing. We only do as we saw him doing.”
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṣāliḥ ibn Kaysān from
‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“e prayer was prescribed as two rak‘as, whether resident or
travelling. en the travelling prayer was kept the same but the
residential prayer was increased.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

asked Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh what was the latest he had seen his
father delay Maghrib while on a journey and Sālim replied, “One
128

time the sun set when we were at Dhāt al-Jaysh and he prayed
Maghrib at al-‘Aqīq.”1
1 ere are 12 miles between them.

9.3 Circumstances in which the prayer has to be shortened
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar began to shorten the prayer at Dhū al-Ḥulayfa when he left
for ḥajj or ‘umra.
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh that his father rode for some distance and shortened the
prayer on the journey.

Mālik said, “at was about four mail-stages.” (approximately fortyeight miles)
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar rode to Dhāt an-Nuṣub and
shortened the prayer on the journey.

he used to travel to Khaybar and would shorten the prayer.

15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to shorten the prayer
when he travelled for a whole day.
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that he used to travel

one mail-stage with Ibn ‘Umar and he would not shorten the prayer.

17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Abbās used to shorten the prayer when he travelled a distance

129

equivalent to that between Makka and Ṭā’if, and that between
Makka and ‘Usfān, and that between Makka and Jidda.
Mālik said, “at is four mail-stages, and to me that is the most
preferable distance for shortening the prayer.”
Mālik said, “Someone who intends to travel does not shorten the
prayer until he has left the houses of the settlement, and he does not
perform it in full until he reaches the ﬁrst houses of his place of
destination, or is close to it.”

9.4 e prayer of a traveller when undecided whether to remain
in a place or not
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to say, “I pray the prayer
of a traveller as long as I am undecided whether to remain
somewhere or not, even if I am detained for twelve nights.”
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Ibn ‘Umar stayed

in Makka for ten nights, shortening the prayer, except when he
prayed it behind an imām, in which case he followed the imām’s
prayer.

9.5 Doing the full prayer when one decides to remain in a place
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Aṭā’ al-Khurasāni that he

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, “A traveller who has decided to
remain somewhere for four nights does the prayer in full.”
Mālik said, “at is what I prefer most out of what I have heard.”
When Mālik was asked about the prayer of a prisoner, he said, “It is
the same as the prayer of a person who remains in one place unless
he is travelling.”

9.6 e prayer of a traveller when acting as imām, or when
praying behind an imām
130

21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh from his father that when ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb went to
Makka, he used to lead them in prayer and do two rak‘as and then
say, “People of Makka, complete the prayer, we are a group who are
travelling.”

he ﬁnished we would stand and complete the prayer.”

praying on a riding beast
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar never used to pray any prayer besides the farḍ prayer, either

direction it was facing.
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that al-Qāsim

ibn Muḥammad and ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr and Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to see his son, ‘Ubaydullāh ibn
ʿAbdullāh, doing voluntary prayers on a journey and he did not
disapprove of it.”
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Amr ibn Yaḥyā al-Māzinī

on his mount while travelling, whichever way it was facing.

of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed eight rak‘as, wrapping himself in a single
garment.
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, that Abū Murra, the mawlā of ‘Aqīl ibn Abī
Ṭālib, told him that he heard Umm Hāni’ bint Abī Ṭālib say, “I
went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in the Year of the Conquest and
found him doing ghusl while his daughter, Fāṭima, was screening
him with a garment. I said to him, ‘Peace be upon you,’ and he
asked, ‘Who is that?’ I replied, ‘Umm Hāni’ bint Abī Tālib,’ and he
said, ‘Welcome, Umm Hāni’!’ When he had ﬁnished his ghusl, he
stood and prayed eight rak‘as, covering himself with one garment,
and then came away. I said, ‘Messenger of Allah, the son of my
mother, ‘Alī, says that he is determined to kill so-and-so, son of
Hubayra, a man I have placed under my protection.’ e Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘We give protection to whoever you have given
protection to, Umm Hāni’.’”
Umm Hāni’ related that this incident happened in the morning.
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn
az-Zubayr that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I never once
saw the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬doing the voluntary prayer of Ḍuḥā,

132

but I myself would perform it. Sometimes the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬would refrain from a practice that he loved to do, fearing that
people would do the same and it would become obligatory (farḍ) for
them.”
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that

‘Ā’isha used to pray Ḍuḥā with eight rak‘as, and she would say, “I
would never stop doing them even if my parents were to be brought
back to life.”

34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn

Abī Ṭalḥa from Anas ibn Mālik that his grandmother, Mulayka,
invited the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬for some food and he ate some of
it. en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Get up and I will lead you
in prayer.”
Anas said, “I stood up and took a woven mat belonging to us that
had become black through long use and sprinkled it with water, and
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stood on it. e orphan and I formed a
row behind him, and the old woman stood behind us. He prayed
two rak‘as with us and then left.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that
‘Ubaydullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Utba said, “I visited ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb just before noon and found him praying a voluntary prayer,
so I stood behind him, but he pulled me nearer and put me next to
him on his right hand side, and then Yarfā came and I moved back
and we formed a row behind him.”

9.10 Strong warning against passing in front of a person praying
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ʿAbd

ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī Sa‘īd al-Khudrī from his father that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do not let anyone pass in front of you
when you are praying. Repel him as much as you can, and, if he
refuses, ﬁght him, for he is only a shayṭān.”
133

37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from Busr ibn Sa‘īd that Zayd ibn Khālid
al-Juhanī sent him to Abū Juhaym to ask him what he had heard
from the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about passing in front of someone
praying. Abū Juhaym said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘If the
person passing in front of a man praying knew what he was
incurring, he would ﬁnd it preferable to wait forty rather than pass
in front of him.’”
Abū an-Naḍr said, “I do not know whether he said forty days or
months or years.”
38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār that Ka‘b al-Aḥbar said, “If the person who passed in
front of a man praying knew what he was bringing on himself, it
would seem better to him to sink into the ground than to pass in
front of him.”
39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar used to disapprove of passing in front of women while
they were praying.

‘Umar would neither pass in front of anyone nor let anyone pass in
front of him.

‘Abbās said, “I came riding up on a donkey while the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was leading the people in prayer at Mina, and I was at that
time nearing puberty. I passed in front of part of the row,
dismounted, sent the donkey oﬀ to graze, and then joined the row,
and no one rebuked me for doing so.”
41

42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

Abī Waqqāṣ used to pass in front of some of the rows while the
134

prayer was in progress.
Mālik said, “I consider that it is permissible to do that if the iqāma
for the prayer has been said and the imām has said the initial takbīr
and a man cannot ﬁnd any way into the mosque except by going
between the rows.”
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Alī ibn

Abī Ṭālib said, “Something passing in front of a man praying does
not break his prayer.”

down into sajda.”
46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he had

heard that Abū Dharr used to say, “Brush away the small stones
with one sweep, but leaving them is better than obtaining a red
camel.”

9.14 Straightening the rows
135

47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Umar ibn al-

Khaṭṭāb used to order the rows to be straightened, and when they
had come to him and told him that the rows were straight, then he
would say the takbīr.
48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from his paternal uncle, Abū

Suhayl ibn Mālik, that his father said, “I was with ‘Uthmān ibn
‘Aﬀān when the iqāma was said for the prayer and I was talking to
him about being assigned a deﬁnite allowance by him. I continued
talking to him while he was levelling some small stones with his
sandals, and then some men that he had entrusted to straighten the
rows came and told him that the rows were straight. He said, to me,
‘Line up in the row,’ and then he said the takbīr.”

9.15 Placing one hand on the other in the prayer
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbd al-Karīm ibn Abī alMukhāriq al-Baṣrī said, “Among things the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said and did

are: ‘As long as you do not feel ashamed, do whatever you wish’, the
placing of one hand on the other in prayer (one places the right
hand on the left), being quick to break the fast, and delaying the
meal before dawn.”
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Ḥāzim ibn Dīnār that

Sahl ibn Sa‘d said, “People used to be ordered to place their right
hands on their left forearms in the prayer.”
Abū Ḥāzim added, “I know for sure that Sahl traces that back to the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬.”

himself

52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Arqam used to lead his companions
in prayer. e time for prayer came one day and he went to relieve
himself. When he returned, he said, “I heard the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘If you wish to defecate, you should do so before the
prayer.’”

angels ask for blessings on each one of you as long as he is in the
place where he has prayed and has not broken wuḍū’, saying, ‘Allah,
forgive him. Allah have mercy on him.’”
Mālik said, “I do not consider that his words refer to anything other
than the discharges that break wuḍū’.”

55 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “You

are in prayer as long as the prayer detains you and there is nothing
that prevents you from returning to your family except the prayer.”

56 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr, that Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān used to say, “Someone
who goes to the mosque in the morning or the afternoon with no
intention of going anywhere else, either to learn good or teach it, is
like someone who does jihād in the way of Allah and returns with
booty.”
57 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nu‘aym ibn ʿAbdullāh al-

Mujmir that he heard Abū Hurayra say, “If any one of you prays and
then sits down in the spot where he has prayed, the angels ask
blessings on him saying, ‘Allah, forgive him. Allah, have mercy on
137

him.’ And if he moves from the spot where he has prayed and sits
elsewhere in the mosque waiting for the prayer, he remains in prayer
until he prays.”
58 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from al-‘Alā’ ibn ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān ibn Ya‘qūb from his father from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Shall I tell you the things by which
Allah erases wrong actions and by which He raises ranks: the
complete and correct performance of wuḍū’ in adverse conditions, a
great number of steps towards the mosque, and waiting after one
prayer for the next prayer. at is the ﬁrm handhold, that is the ﬁrm
handhold, that is the ﬁrm handhold.”
59 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab said, “It is said that no one except a hypocrite leaves
the mosque after the call to prayer, except for someone who intends
to return.”

az-Zubayr from ‘Amr ibn Sulaym az-Zuraqī from Abū Qatāda alAnsārī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When you enter the
mosque, you should pray two rak‘as before you sit down.”
61 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, that Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān
asked him, “Did I not see your master sit down before praying after
he had entered the mosque?”

Abū an-Naḍr said, “By that he meant ‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, and
he was ﬁnding fault with him for sitting down before praying after
he had come into the mosque.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “It is good to do that but not
obligatory.”

9.19 Placing the hands ﬂat on the surface by the face in
prostration
138

ʿ

62 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to place his palms ﬂat on the surface where he put his
forehead. Nāﬁ‘ said, “I have seen him take his hands out from under
his burnous on a very cold day and place them on the ground.”

63 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “When any of you puts his forehead on the
ground he should put his palms on the surface on which he puts his
forehead. en, when he rises, he should raise them, for the hands
prostrate just as the face prostrates.”

9.20 Turning around and clapping when necessary during the
prayer
64 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Hāzim Salama ibn
Dīnār from Sahl ibn Sa‘īd as-Sā‘idī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

went to the tribe of Banū ‘Amr ibn ‘Awf to settle their disputes. e
time for the prayer came and the mu’adhdhin came to Abū Bakr aṣṢiddīq and asked, “Could you lead the people in prayer and I will
say the iqāma?” He said, “Yes”, and Abū Bakr started to pray. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬arrived while the people were doing the
prayer and went through until he was standing in the row. People
clapped, but Abū Bakr did not turn round from his prayer. When
the people increased their clapping, he turned and saw the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬indicated to
him to stay in his place. Abū Bakr raised his hands and praised
Allah that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had told him to do that. en
he drew back until he was in the row, and the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬stepped forward and led the prayer. When he had ﬁnished he
said, “Abū Bakr, what stopped you from staying put like I told you?”
Abū Bakr replied, “It is not for Ibn Abī Quhāfa to pray in front of
the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Why did I see you all clapping so
much? If something happens while you are in the prayer you should
say ‘Subḥānallāh’ (Glory be to Allah), and when you say
‘Subḥānallāh’, attention will be paid to it. Clapping is for women.”
139

65 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Ibn ‘Umar would

never turn around when praying.

66 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Abū Ja‘far al-Qārī said, “I

was praying, and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar was behind me and I was not
aware of it. en I turned round and he prodded me (in
disapproval).”

67 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Abū

Umāma ibn Sahl ibn Ḥunayf said, “Zayd ibn ābit entered the
mosque and found the people in rukū‘, so he went into rukū‘ and
then moved slowly forward until he reached the row.”

69 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

ibn Ḥāzim from his father that ‘Amr ibn Sulaym az-Zuraqī said,

Allah ‫ ﷺ‬how they were to ask for blessings upon him and he replied
that they should say, ‘O Allah, bless Muḥammad and his wives and
his descendants as You blessed the family of Ibrāhīm, and grant
blessing to Muḥammad and his wives and his descendants as You
granted blessing to the family of Ibrāhīm. You are worthy of Praise
and Glorious.’”
“Allāhumma ṣalli ‘alā Muḥammad wa azwājihi wa dhuriyyatihi
kamā ṣallayta ‘alā āli Ibrāhīm, wa bārik ‘alā Muḥammad wa azwājihi
wa dhuriyyatihi kamā bārakta ‘alā āli Ibrāhīm, innaka ḥamīdun
majīd.”
70 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nu‘aym ibn ʿAbdullāh al-

Mujmir that Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn Zayd told him that
Abū Mas‘ūd al-Anṣārī said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came to us
140

at the gathering of Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubāda. Bashīr ibn Sa‘d said to him,
‘Allah has ordered us to ask for blessings on you, Messenger of
Allah. How should we do it?’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬remained
silent until we wished we had not asked him. en he told us to say,
‘’O Allah, bless Muḥammad and the family of Muḥammad as You
blessed Ibrāhīm, and grant blessing to Muḥammad and the family
of Muḥammad as You granted blessing to the family of Ibrāhīm in
all the worlds. You are worthy of Praise and Glorious,’ and then give
the taslīm as you have learnt.”
“Allāhumma ṣalli ‘alā Muḥammad wa āli Muḥammad kama ṣallayta
‘alā Ibrāhīm, wa bārik ‘alā Muḥammad wa āli Muḥammad kama
bārakta ‘alā āli Ibrāhīm fī’l ‘alamīn. Innaka ḥamīdun majīd.”
71 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār said, “I
saw ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar stop by the grave of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and
ask for blessings on the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and on Abū Bakr and ‘Umar.”

9.23 How to perform the prayer in general
72 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Ibn ‘Umar that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray two rak‘as before Ẓuhr and

two rak‘as after it, two rak‘as after Maghrib, in his house, and two
rak‘as after ‘Ishā’. He did not pray after jumu‘a until he had left the
mosque, and then he prayed two rak‘as.

73 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do

you see the direction I am facing here? By Allah, neither your
humbleness nor your rukū‘ is hidden from me. I can see you behind
my back.”

74 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to go to Qubā’ (to

pray), he would walk as well as ride.

75 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from anNu‘mān ibn Murra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “What do

141

you think about drunkenness, stealing and adultery?” at was
before anything had been revealed about them. ey answered,
“Allah and His Messenger know best.” He said, “ey are detestable
acts and there is a punishment for them. But the worst thief is the
one who steals his prayer.” ey asked, “How can someone steal his
prayer, Messenger of Allah?” He replied, “By not performing rukū‘
or sajda properly.”
76 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hisham ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Perform some of the

prayers in your houses.”

77 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “When a sick man is unable to prostrate he
should motion with his head and not raise anything to his
forehead.”

Raḥmān that if ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar arrived at the mosque when
the people had already prayed, he would begin with the obligatory
prayer and not pray anything before it.
79 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar passed by a man who was praying and said, “Peace be upon
you,” and the man replied to him. ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar returned to
him and said, “When someone says, ‘Peace be upon you’ to you
while you are praying do not reply, but give a signal with your
hand.”
80 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Someone who only remembers that he has
forgotten a prayer when he is praying the next prayer behind an
imām should pray the prayer he has forgotten after the imām has
said the taslīm and then pray the other one again.”

81 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān that his paternal uncle, Wāsi‘
142

ʿ

ibn Ḥabbān, said, “I was praying, and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar was
resting his back against the wall of the qibla. When I had ﬁnished
the prayer I turned towards him on my left-hand side. ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Umar said, ‘What stopped you from turning away to your
right?’ I replied, ‘I saw you and turned towards you.’ ʿAbdullāh said,
‘You are correct. People say that you should turn away to your right,
but when you pray you can turn whichever way you wish. If you like,
to your right, and if you like, to your left.”
82 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that one of the Muhājirūn, in whom he saw no harm,
asked ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ, “Can I pray in a place where
camels are watered?” ʿAbdullāh replied, “No, but you can pray in a
sheep-pen.”

83 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab asked, “In which prayer do you sit in every rak‘a?” Sa‘īd
replied, “It is Maghrib when you have missed one rak‘a, and that is
the sunna in all the prayers.”

9.24 Prayer in general
84 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Āmir ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn

az-Zubayr from ‘Amr ibn Sulaym az-Zuraqi from Abū Qatāda alAnṣārī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray carrying
Umāma, the daughter of Zaynab, the daughter of the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬, and Abū al-‘Āṣ ibn Rabi‘a ibn ʿAbd Shams. When he
prostrated, he put her down. When he stood up, he lifted her up
again.
85 Yaḥyā related to me from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere are angels

which take turns in being with you in the night which are followed
by other angels in the day, and they meet together at the ‘Aṣr and
Fajr prayers. en the ones who were with you during the night
ascend and Allah asks them – although He knows better than they
do – ‘How were My slaves when you left them?’ ey reply, ‘When
143

we left them they were praying and when we came to them, they
were praying.’”
86 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Tell Abū Bakr to lead the people in

prayer.” ‘Ā’isha said, “Messenger of Allah, when Abū Bakr stands in
your place his voice does not reach the ears of the people because of
his weeping, so tell ‘Umar to lead the people in prayer.” He said,
“Tell Abū Bakr to lead the people in prayer.”
‘Ā’isha continued, “I told Ḥafṣa to tell him that when Abū Bakr
stood in his place his voice did not reach the ears of the people
because of his weeping, and that he should tell ‘Umar to lead the
people in prayer. Ḥafṣa did so, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘You are the companions of Yūsuf!’ (referring to the women who cut
their hands when they saw the beauty of Yūsuf thereby displaying
their hidden opposition). Tell Abū Bakr to lead the people in
prayer!’”
‘Ā’isha added that Ḥafṣa said to her, “I have never had anything
good from you!”
87 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Aṭā’ ibn

Yazīd al-Laythī that ‘Ubaydullāh ibn ‘Adī ibn al-Khiyār said, “Once
when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sitting with some people, a man
came to him and spoke secretly to him. Nobody knew what he had
said until the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬disclosed that he had asked for
permission to kill one of the hypocrites. When he disclosed this, the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Does he not testify that there is no god
but Allah and that Muḥammad is the Messenger of Allah?’ e
man replied, ‘Of course, but it is not a true testimony.’ He asked,
‘Does he not do the prayer?’ and the man replied, ‘Of course, but it
is not a true prayer.’ e Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘ose are the ones whom
Allah has forbidden me (to kill).’”

144

88 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “O Allah! Do not

make my grave an idol that is worshipped. e anger of Allah on
those who took the graves of their Prophets as places of worship was
terrible.”
89 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ibn Shihāb from Maḥmūd

ibn Rabī‘ al-Anṣārī that ‘Itbān ibn Mālik, who was a blind man,
used to lead his people in prayer, and he said to the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “Sometimes it is dark and rainy and there is a lot of water
around outside, and I am a man who has lost his sight. Messenger
of Allah, pray in a certain place in my house so that I can take it as a
place to pray.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came to him and asked,
“Where would you like me to pray?” He indicated a place to him
and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed there.
90 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Abbād

ibn Tamīm from his paternal uncle that he saw the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬lying down in the mosque with one foot on top of the
other.
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān k used
to do the same.
91 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

ʿAbdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd said to a certain man, “You are living in a
time when men of understanding (fuqahā’) are many and Qur’ān
reciters are few, when the ḥudūd deﬁned in the Qur’ān are guarded
and its letters are neglected, when few people ask and many give,
when they make the prayer long and the khuṭba short, and put their
good actions before their desires. A time will come upon people
when their fuqahā’ are few but their Qur’ān reciters are many, when
the letters of the Qur’ān are guarded carefully but its ḥudūd are
neglected, when many ask but few give, when they make the khuṭba
long but the prayer short, and put their desires before their actions.”
145

92 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “I have

heard that the ﬁrst of the actions of a slave to be considered on the
Day of Rising will be the prayer. If it is accepted from him the rest
of his actions will be considered, and if it is not accepted from him,
then none of his actions will be considered.”
93 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e actions
which the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬loved most were those which were

done most constantly.”

94 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard from ‘Āmir

ibn Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ that his father said, “ere were two
brothers, one of whom died forty nights before the other. e merit
of the ﬁrst was being mentioned in the presence of the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he said, ‘Was the other one not a Muslim?’ ey
answered, ‘Of course, Messenger of Allah, and there was no harm in
him.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘What will make you realise
what his prayer has brought him? e prayer is like a deep river of
sweet water running by your door into which you plunge ﬁve times a
day. How much of your dirtiness do you think that will leave? You
do not realise what his prayer has brought him?’”
95 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that if anyone

passed by ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār in the mosque with something to trade, he
would call him and ask, “What is the matter with you? What do
you want?” If the man said that he wished to trade with him, he
would say, “You need the market of this world. is is the market of
the Next World.”
96 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb set aside an area near the mosque called al-Buṭayḥā’ and
said, “Whoever wishes to talk nonsense or recite poetry or raise his
voice should go to this area.”

9.25 Stimulation of the desire for prayer in general

146

97 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from his paternal uncle Abū

Suhayl ibn Mālik that his father heard Ṭalḥa ibn ‘Ubaydullāh say,
“Once one of the people of Najd came to the Messenger of Allah
‫ﷺ‬. He had dishevelled hair and although his voice could be heard
we could not make out what he was saying until he drew nearer and
then we found he was asking about Islam. e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said to him, ‘ere are ﬁve prayers during the day and the night.’
He asked, ‘Do I have to do anything else besides that?’ He
answered, ‘No, except what you do of your own accord.’ e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬then added, ‘And fasting the month of
Ramaḍān.’ He said, ‘Is there anything else I have to do?’ He said,
‘No, except what you do of your own accord.’ e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬then mentioned zakāt. e man said, ‘Is there anything
else that I have to do?’ He replied, ‘No, except what you do of your
own accord.’
He continued, “e man went away saying, ‘By Allah, I will not do
any more than this nor will I do any less.’ e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘at man will be successful if he is telling the truth.’”

98 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“Shayṭān ties three knots at the back of your head when you sleep,
and he seals the place of each knot with ‘You have a long night
ahead, so sleep.’ If you wake up and remember Allah, a knot is
untied. When you do wuḍū’, a knot is untied. When you pray, a
knot is untied, and morning ﬁnds you lively and in good spirits, and
if not, morning ﬁnds you in bad spirits and lazy.”

147

10. e Two ‘Īds
10.1 Ghusl for the two ‘Īds, the call to prayer for them, and the
iqāma
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard more than one

of their men of knowledge say, “ere has been no adhān or iqāma
for the ‘Īd al-Fiṭr or the ‘Īd al-Aḍḥā since the time of the Messenger
of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.”
Mālik said, “at is the sunna and there is no disagreement about it
among us.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to have a ghusl on the day of ‘Īd al-Fiṭr before going to
the place of prayer.

10.2 e order to pray before the khuṭba on the two ‘Īds
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray before the khuṭba on the days of

‘Īd al-Fiṭr and the day of ‘Īd al-Aḍḥā.

4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Abū Bakr

and ‘Umar used to do that.

5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Abū

‘Ubayd, the mawlā of Ibn Azhar said, “I was present at one of the
‘Īds with ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb. He prayed, and then after he had
prayed he gave a khuṭba to the people and said, ‘e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade fasting on these two days – the day you break your
fast (after Ramaḍān), and the day you eat from your sacriﬁce (after
the Ḥajj).’”
Abū ‘Ubayd continued, “en I was present at one of the ‘Īds with
‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān. He came and prayed, and when he had ﬁnished
148

he gave a khuṭba and said, ‘Two ‘īds have been joined together for
you on this day of yours. If any of the people of al-‘Āliyya (the hills
outlying Madīna) want to wait for the jumu‘a they can do so, and if
any of them want to return, I have given them permission.’”
Abū ‘Ubayd continued, “en I was present at an ‘Īd with ‘Alī ibn
Abī Ṭālib (at the time when ‘Uthmān was under siege). He came
and prayed, and then after he had prayed he gave a khuṭba.”

10.3 e order to eat before going out on the morning of the ‘Īd
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his

father that he used to eat on the day of the ‘Īd al-Fiṭr before going
out.

7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd al-

Musayyab told him that people used to be told to eat on the day of
Fiṭr before setting out.
Mālik said that he did not consider that people had to do that on
the ‘Īd al-Aḍḥā.

10.4 e takbīrs and the recitation in the prayer of the two ‘Īds
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḍamra ibn Sa‘īd al-Māzinī

from ‘Ubaydullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd that ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb asked Abū Wāqid al-Laythī what the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to recite in the prayers of Aḍḥā and Fiṭr. He said, “He
used to recite Sūra Qāf (50) and Sūrat al-Inshiqāq (84).”
9 Yaḥyā to me from Mālik that Nāﬁ‘, the mawlā of ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “I attended Aḍḥā and Fiṭr with Abū Hurayra and he
said ‘Allah is greater’ seven times in the ﬁrst rak‘a, before the
recitation, and ﬁve times in the second, before the recitation.”
Mālik said, “at is the position with us.”

149

Ī

Regarding a man who ﬁnds that people have ﬁnished the ‘Īd prayer,
Mālik said that he did not think that he had to pray either in the
place where the prayer was performed nor in his house. If he does
perform the prayer in the place or in his house, he did not see any
harm in doing that. He says the takbīr seven times in the ﬁrst rak‘a
before the recitation and ﬁve times in the second before the
recitation.

10.5 Refraining from praying before and after the two ‘Īd prayers
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar did not pray either before the prayer or after it on the day of
Fiṭr.
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab used to go to the place of prayer after praying Ṣubḥ,
and before the sun rose.

10.6 Permission to pray before and after the two ‘Īd prayers
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim that his father used to pray four rak‘as before he went to the
place of prayer.
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his father used

to pray in the mosque on the day of Fiṭr before the prayer.

10.7 e coming of the imām on the Day of the ‘Īd and waiting
for the khuṭba
14 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “e sunna concerning the

time of prayer on the ‘Īds of Fiṭr and Aḍḥā – and there is no
disagreement amongst us about it – is that the imām leaves his
house and as soon as he has reached the place of prayer the prayer
falls due.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether a man who prayed with
the imām could leave before the khuṭba, and he said, “He should
150

not leave until the imām leaves.”

151

11. e Fear Prayer
11.1 e Fear Prayer
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn Rūmān from

Ṣāliḥ ibn Khawwāt from someone who had prayed (the fear prayer)
with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬on the day of Dhāt ar-Riqā‘ that
one group had formed a row with him and one group had formed a
row opposite the enemy. He then prayed one rak‘a with the group he
was with, and then remained standing while they ﬁnished by
themselves. ey then left and formed a row opposite the enemy,
and then the other group came and he prayed the remaining rak‘a of
his prayer with them, and then remained sitting while they ﬁnished
by themselves. en he said the taslīm with them.
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad from Ṣāliḥ ibn Khawwāt that Sahl ibn Abī
Ḥathma related to him that the form of the fear prayer was that the
imām stood with a group of his companions, while another group
faced the enemy. e imām prayed one rak‘a with them, including
the prostration, and then stood. He remained standing while they
completed the remaining rak‘a by themselves. ey then said the
taslīm, left, and formed up opposite the enemy while the imām
remained standing. en the others who had not prayed came
forward and said the takbīr behind the imām and he prayed one
rak‘a with them, including the prostration. He then said the taslīm,
while they stood up and prayed the remaining rak‘a by themselves.
en they said the taslīm.

3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar, when asked about the fear prayer said, “e imām and a
group of people go forward and the imām prays a rak‘a with them,
while another group, who have not yet prayed, position themselves
between him and the enemy. When those who are with him have
prayed a rak‘a they draw back to where those who have not prayed
152

are, and do not say the taslīm. en those who have not prayed
come forward and pray a rak‘a with him. en the imām leaves, as
he has now prayed two rak‘as. Everyone else in both groups stands
and prays a rak‘a by himself after the imām has left. In this way each
of the two groups will have prayed two rak‘as. If the fear is greater
than that, then the men pray standing on their feet or mounted,
either facing the qibla or otherwise.”
Mālik said that Nāﬁ‘ said, “I do not believe that ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar related it from anyone other than the Messenger of Allah
‫ﷺ‬.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd
ibn al-Musayyab said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did not pray

Ẓuhr and ‘Aṣr on the Day of the Trench until after the sun had set.”

Mālik said, “e ḥadīth of al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad from Ṣāliḥ ibn
Khawwāt is the one I like most out of what I have heard about the
Fear Prayer.”

153

12. e Eclipse Prayer
12.1 How to pray the Eclipse Prayer
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his
father that ‘A’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere was an
eclipse of the sun in the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬led the people in prayer. He stood, and did

so for a long time. en he went into rukū‘, and made the rukū‘
long. en he stood again, and did so for a long time, though not as
long as the ﬁrst time. en he went into rukū‘, and made the rukū‘
long, though not as long as the ﬁrst time. en he rose, and went
down into sajda. He then did the same in the second rak‘a, and by
the time he had ﬁnished the sun had appeared. He then gave a
khuṭba to the people, in which he praised Allah and then said, ‘e
sun and the moon are two of Allah’s signs. ey are not eclipsed for
anyone’s death nor for anyone’s life. When you see an eclipse, call on
Allah and say, “Allah is greater” and give ṣadaqa.’ en he said, ‘O
community of Muḥammad! By Allah, there is no one more jealous
than Allah of a male or female slave of his who commits adultery. O
community of Muḥammad! By Allah, if you knew what I knew, you
would laugh little and weep much.’”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said, “ere was an eclipse of
the sun and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed, and the people
prayed with him. He stood for a long time, nearly as long as (it
takes to recite) Sūrat al-Baqara (2), and then went into rukū‘ for a
long time. en he rose and stood for a long time, though less than
the ﬁrst time. en he went into rukū‘ for a long time, though less
than the ﬁrst time. en he went down into sajda. en he stood for
a long time, though less than the ﬁrst time. en he went into rukū‘
for a long time, though less than the ﬁrst time. en he rose and
stood for a long time, though less than the ﬁrst time. en he went
into rukū‘ for a long time, though less than the ﬁrst time. en he
154

went down into sajda, and by the time he had ﬁnished the sun had
appeared. en he said, ‘e sun and the moon are two of Allah’s
signs. ey do not eclipse for anyone’s death nor for anyone’s life.
When you see an eclipse, remember Allah.’ ey said, ‘Messenger
of Allah, we saw you reach out for something while you were
standing here and then we saw you withdraw.’ He said, ‘I saw the
Garden and I reached out for a bunch of grapes from it, and if I had
taken it you would have been able to eat from it for as long as this
world lasted. en I saw the Fire – and I have never seen anything
more hideous than what I saw today – and I saw that most of its
people were women.’ ey said, ‘Why, Messenger of Allah?’ He
said, ‘Because of their ungratefulness (kufr).’ Someone asked, ‘Are
they ungrateful to Allah?’ He said, ‘And they are ungrateful to their
husbands and they are ungrateful for good behaviour (towards
them). Even if you were to behave well towards one of them for a
whole lifetime and then she were to see you do something (that she
did not like) she would say that she had never seen anything good
from you.’”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Amra
bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬that a

Jewish woman came to beg from her and said, “May Allah give you
refuge from the punishment of the grave.” So ‘Ā’isha asked the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “Are people punished in their graves?” and
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬took refuge in Allah from that. en one
morning the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬out on a journey and there was
an eclipse of the sun, and he returned in the late morning and
passed through his apartments. en he stood and prayed, and the
people stood behind him. He stood for a long time, and then went
into rukū‘ for a long time. en he rose and stood for a long time,
though less than the ﬁrst time, and then went into rukū‘ for a long
time, though less than the ﬁrst time. en he rose, and went down
into sajda. en he stood for a long time, though less than the time
before, and then went into rukū‘ for a long time, though less than
the time before. en he rose and stood for a long time, though less
than the time before, and then went into rukū‘ for a long time
155

though less than the time before. en he rose, and went down into
sajda. When he had ﬁnished he said what Allah willed him to say,
and then he told them to seek protection for themselves from the
punishment of the grave.”

12.2 About the Eclipse Prayer
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

Fāṭima bint al-Mundhir that Asmā’ bint Abī Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq said, “I
went to ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬during an eclipse of the
sun, and everybody was standing in prayer, and she too was standing
praying. I asked, ‘What is everybody doing?’ She pointed towards
the sky with her hand and said, ‘Glory be to Allah.’ I said, ‘A sign?’
She indicated ‘Yes’ with her head.”
She continued, “I stood until I had almost fainted, and I began to
pour water over my head. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬praised Allah
and spoke well of Him, and then said, ‘ere is nothing which I had
previously not seen beforehand that I have not now seen while
standing – even the Garden and the Fire. It has been revealed to me
that you will be tried in your graves with a trial, like, or near to, the
trial of the Dajjāl (I do not know which one Asmā’ said). Everyone
of you will have someone who comes to him and asks him, ‘What
do you know about this man?’ A believer (mu’min), or one who has
certainty (mūqin) (I do not know which one Asmā’ said), will say,
‘He is Muḥammad, the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, who came to us
with clear proofs and guidance, and we answered and believed and
followed.’ He will then be told, ‘Sleep in a good state. We know
now that you were a believer.’ A hypocrite, however, or one who has
doubts (I do not know which one Asmā’ said), will say, ‘I do not
know, I heard everybody saying something and I said it.’”

13. Praying for Rain
13.1 How to pray for rain
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

‘Amr ibn Ḥazm that he had heard ‘Abbād ibn Tamīm say that he
had heard ʿAbdullāh ibn Zayd al-Māzinī say, “e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came out to the place of prayer and asked for rain, and
when he faced the qibla he turned his cloak inside out.”
Mālik was asked how many rak‘as there were in the prayer of asking
for rain and he said, “Two rak‘as, and the imām does the prayer
before he gives the khuṭba. He prays two rak‘as, and then he gives a
khuṭba and makes supplication, facing the qibla and turning his
cloak inside out. He recites out loud in both rak‘as, and when he
turns his cloak inside out he puts what is on his right on his left and
what is on his left on his right, and all the people turn their cloaks
inside out when the imām does so and face the qibla, sitting.”

13.2 What is reported about praying for rain
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Amr
ibn Shu‘ayb that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, when he asked for

rain, “O Allah, give water to Your slaves and Your animals, and
spread Your mercy, and give life to Your dead land.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sharīk ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn

Abī Namir that Anas ibn Mālik said, “A man came to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said, ‘Messenger of Allah, our animals
are dying and our camels are too weak to travel, so make
supplication to Allah.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, made
supplication, and then it rained on us from one jumu‘a to the next.”
Anas continued, “en a man came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
and said, ‘Messenger of Allah, our houses have fallen down, the
paths are blocked, and our ﬂocks are dying.’ e Messenger of Allah
157

‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘O Allah, (only) the mountain and hill-tops, the valley

bottoms, and the places where trees grow.’”

Anas added, “It cleared away from Madīna like a garment being
removed.”
Mālik said, about a man who missed the prayer of asking for rain
but caught the khuṭba and wished to pray in the mosque, or in his
house when he returned, “He is free to do so, or not, as he wishes.”

13.3 About asking the stars for rain
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṣāliḥ ibn Kaysān from

‘Ubaydullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd that Zayd ibn
Khālid al-Juhanī said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬led us in the
Ṣubḥ prayer at Ḥudaybiya after it had rained in the night. When he
had ﬁnished he went up to the people and asked, ‘Do you know
what your Lord has said?’ ey replied, ‘Allah and His Messenger
know best.’ He said, ‘Some of My slaves have begun the morning
believing in Me, and others have begun it rejecting Me. As for those
who say, “We had rain through the overﬂowing favour of Allah and
His mercy,” they believe in Me and reject the stars. But as for those
who say, “We had rain through such and such a star, they reject Me
and believe in the stars.”’”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to say, “When a cloud appears from the

direction of the sea and then goes towards Syria, it will be an
abundant source of rain.”

6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Abū

Hurayra used to say, when morning came after it had rained on the
people, “We have been rained upon by the rain of Allah’s opening,”
and would then recite the āyat, “Whatever mercy Allah opens up to
people no one can withhold, and whatever He withholds no one can
afterwards release.” (35:2)

158

14. e Qibla
14.1 e prohibition against relieving oneself facing the qibla
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī

Ṭalḥa that Rāﬁ‘ ibn Isḥāq, a mawlā of the family of ash-Shifā’ who
was known as the mawlā of Abū Ṭalḥa, heard Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī,
one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say while he
was in Egypt, “By Allah! I do not know how to deal with these
lavatories since the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘When you go to
defecate or urinate, do not expose your genitals towards the qibla,
and do not put your back to it.’”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from one of the Anṣār
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade defecating or urinating

while facing the qibla.

14.2 Permission to face the qibla when urinating or defecating
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān from his paternal uncle, Wāsi‘
ibn Ḥabbān, that ʿAbdullah ibn ‘Umar said, “People used to say,
‘When you sit to relieve yourself, do not face the qibla or
Jerusalem.’”
ʿAbdullāh continued, “I went up on top of a house of ours and saw
the Messenger of Allah ‫( ﷺ‬squatting) on two unﬁred bricks facing
Jerusalem, relieving himself.”

Ibn ‘Umar added, “Perhaps you are one of those who pray folded on
their haunches.”2
2 By saying this, he was making reference to his ignorance of the proper way of
doing things.

Wāsi‘ replied, “I do not know, by Allah!”
159

Mālik said that he meant those who pray without lifting themselves
from the ground properly, who cleave close to the ground in
prostration.

14.3 e prohibition of spitting towards the Qibla
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬saw spittle on the wall of the

qibla and scraped it oﬀ. en he went up to the people and said,
“Do not spit in front of you when you are praying, because Allah,
the Blessed and Exalted, is in front of you when you pray.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his
father from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬

saw spittle, or mucus or phlegm, on the wall of the qibla and scraped
it oﬀ.

14.4 About the qibla
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnar that

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “On one occasion when the people were
praying Ṣubḥ at Qubā a man came to them and said, ‘A piece of
Qur’ān was sent down to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬last night, and
he was ordered to face the Ka‘ba, so face it.’ ey had been facing
Syria, so they turned round and faced the Ka‘ba.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd
ibn al-Musayyab said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed towards

Jerusalem for sixteen months after arriving in Madīna. en the
qibla was changed two months before the battle of Badr.”

8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Umar ibn al-

Khaṭṭāb said, “Any direction that is between East and West can be
taken as a qibla if the person praying is face-on to the House.”

14.5 e Mosque of the Prophet

160

9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Rabāḥ and

‘Ubaydullāh ibn Abī ʿAbdullāh Salmān al-Agharr from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A prayer in this
mosque of mine is better than a thousand prayers in any other
mosque, except the Masjid al-Ḥarām (in Makka).”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Khubayb ibn ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān from Ḥafṣ ibn ‘Āṣim from Abū Hurayra or from Abū Sa‘īd
al-Khudrī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “What is between
my house and my minbar is one of the meadows of the Garden, and
my minbar is on my watering-place (al-Ḥawḍ).”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

from ‘Abbād ibn Tamīm from ʿAbdullāh ibn Zayd al-Māzinī that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “What is between my house and
my minbar is one of the meadows of the Garden”

14.6 Women going out to the mosque
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Umar said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Do not forbid the

female slaves of Allah from (going to) the mosques of Allah.’”

13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard from Busr ibn
Sa‘īd that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “None of you women

should use perfume when you attend at the ‘Ishā’ prayer.”

14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Atika

bint Zayd ibn ‘Amr ibn Nufayl, the wife of ‘Umar al-Khaṭṭāb, used
to ask ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb for permission to go to the mosque. He
would keep silent, so she would say, “By Allah, I will go out, unless
you forbid me,” and he did not forbid her.
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Amra
bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that ‘A’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said,
“If the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had seen what women do now, he

would have forbidden them to go into the mosques, just as the
women of the tribe of Israel were forbidden.”
161

Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that he asked ‘Amra, “Were the women of the
tribe of Israel forbidden to go into mosques?” and she replied, “Yes.”

162

15. e Qur’ān
15.1 e command to be in wuḍū’ (when touching the Qur’ān)
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn
Ḥazm that it said in a letter sent by the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬to

‘Amr ibn Ḥazm that no one should touch the Qur’ān unless he was
pure.
Mālik said, “No one should carry the Qur’ān by its strap, or on a
cushion, unless he is pure. If it were permissible to do so, it would
also have been permissible to carry it in its cover. is is not because
of there being something on the hands of the one who carries it by
which the Qur’ān will be soiled, but because it is disapproved of for
someone to carry the Qur’ān without being pure out of respect for
the Qur’ān, and in order to honour it.”

Mālik said, “e best thing that I have heard about this is the āyat
‘No one may touch it except the puriﬁed.’ (56:79) It ranks with the
āyats in Sūrat ‘Abasa where Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says,
‘Truly it is a reminder, and whoever wills pays heed to it. Inscribed
on honoured pages, exalted, puriﬁed, by the hands of scribes, noble,
virtuous.’ (80:11-16)”

15.2 Allowance to recite the Qur’ān while not in wuḍū’
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ayyūb ibn Abī Tamīma as-

Sakhtayānī from Muḥammad ibn Sīrīn that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
was with some people who were reciting Qur’ān. He went to relieve
himself and then came back and recited Qur’ān. One of the men
said to him, “Amīr al-Mūminīn, are you reciting the Qur’ān without
being in wuḍū’?” Umar replied, “Who gave you a verdict on this?
Was it Musaylima?”

15.3 e division of the Qur’ān into sections (ḥizbs)
163

3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwūd ibn al-Ḥuṣayn from

al-A‘raj from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ʿAbd al-Qāri’ that ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb said, “If someone misses reading his ḥizb at night and reads
it between the time when the sun has passed the meridian and the
Ẓuhr prayer, he has not missed it, or it is as if he has caught it.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “Once

while Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān and I were sitting down,
Muḥammad called a man over to him and said to him, ‘Tell me
what you have heard from your father.’ e man replied that his
father had told him that he went to Zayd ibn ābit and asked him,
‘What do you think of reciting the entire Qur’ān in seven days?’
Zayd said, ‘at is good, but I prefer to recite it over two weeks or
ten days. Ask me why that is.’ He said, ‘I ask you why then.’ Zayd
said, ‘So that I can reﬂect on it and pause in it.’”

15.4 About the Qur’ān
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr that ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ʿAbd al-Qāri’ said that he had
heard ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb say, “I heard Hishām ibn Ḥakīm ibn
Ḥizām reciting Sūrat al-Furqān (25) diﬀerently from me, and it was
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬who had recited it to me. I was about to
rush up to him but I granted him a respite until he had ﬁnished his
prayer. en I grabbed him by his cloak and took him to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said, ‘Messenger of Allah, I heard this
man reciting Sūrat al-Furqān diﬀerently from the way you recited it
to me.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Let him go.’ en he said,
‘Recite, Hishām,’ and Hishām recited as I had heard him recite. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘It was sent down like that.’ en he
said to me, ‘Recite,’ and I recited the sūra, and he said, ‘It was sent
down like that. is Qur’ān was sent down in seven (diﬀerent)
modes, so recite from it whatever is easy for you.’”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A man who knows the

164

Qur’ān well is like a man who has a hobbled camel. If he takes care
of it, he keeps it, and if he lets it go, it gets away.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his
father from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬that al-Ḥārith ibn
Hishām asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “How does revelation
come to you?” and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬replied, “Sometimes it

comes to me like the ringing of a bell, and that is the hardest for me,
and when it leaves me I remember what has been said. And
sometimes the angel appears to me in the likeness of a man and
talks to me and I remember what he says.”
‘Ā’isha added, “I saw it coming down on him on an intensely cold
day, and when it had left him his forehead was dripping with sweat.”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his
father said that Sūrat ‘Abasa (80) was revealed about ʿAbdullāh ibn
Umm Maktūm. He came to the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and began to say, “O

Muḥammad, show me a place near you (where I can sit),” whilst one
of the leading men of the idol-worshippers was in audience with the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬. e Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬began to turn away from him and give
his attention to the other man, and he said to him, “Father of soand-so, do you see any harm in what I am saying?” And he said,
“No, by the blood (of our sacriﬁces) I see no harm in what you are
saying.” And then ‘Abasa – “He frowned and turned away when the
blind man came” – was sent down.
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from his
father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was on one of his journeys

and one night ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, who was travelling with him,
asked him about something, but he did not answer him. He asked
him again, but he did not answer him. en he asked him again,
and again he did not answer him. ‘Umar said, “May your mother be
bereaved of you, ‘Umar. ree times you have importuned the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬with a question and he has not answered you
at all.”
165

‘Umar continued, “I got my camel moving until, when I was out
ahead of the people, I feared that a piece of Qur’ān was being sent
down about me. It was not long before I heard a crier calling for me,
and I said that I feared that a piece of Qur’ān had been sent down
about me.”
He continued, “I came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said,
‘Peace be upon you’ to him, and he said, ‘A sūra has been sent down
to me this night that is more beloved to me than anything on which
the sun rises.’” en he recited Sūrat al-Fatḥ (48).
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī from Abū Salama
ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that Abū Sa‘īd said that he had heard the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, “A group of people will appear among
you whose prayer, fasting and deeds will make you think little of
your own prayer, fasting and deeds. ey will recite the Qur’ān but
it will not get past their throats, and they will pass through the dīn
like an arrow passes through game. You look at the arrowhead and
you see nothing, and you look at the shaft and you see nothing, and
you look at the ﬂights and you see nothing, and you are in doubt
about the notch.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that it took

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar eight years to learn Sūrat al-Baqara.

15.5 e prostration of the Qur’ān
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Yazīd, the

mawlā of al-Aswad ibn Sufyān, from Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd arRaḥmān that Abū Hurayra recited Sūrat al-Inshiqāq (sūra 84) to
them and prostrated in it. When he had ﬁnished he told them that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had prostrated in it.
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘, the mawlā of Ibn

‘Umar, that a man from Egypt told him that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
recited Sūrat al-Ḥajj (sūra 22) and prostrated twice in it, and then
166

said, “is sūra has been given special preference by having two
prostrations in it.”
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār said, “I
saw ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar prostrate twice in Sūrat al-Ḥajj (22).”
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from al-A‘raj
that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb recited Sūrat an-Najm (53) and

prostrated in it, and then got up and recited another sūra.

16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb once recited a piece of Qur’ān
requiring a prostration while he was on the minbar on the day of
jumu‘a, and he came down and prostrated, and everyone prostrated
with him. en he recited it again the next jumu‘a and everybody
prepared to prostrate but he said, “At your ease. Allah has not
prescribed it for us unless we wish.” He did not prostrate and he
stopped them from prostrating.
Mālik said, “e imām does not come down and prostrate when he
recites a piece of Qur’ān requiring a prostration while he is on the
minbar.”
Mālik said, “e position with us is that there are eleven prescribed
prostrations in the Qur’ān, none of which are in the Mufaṣṣal.”
Mālik said, “No one should recite any of the pieces of Qur’ān that
require a prostration after the prayers of Ṣubḥ and ‘Aṣr. is is
because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade prayer after Ṣubḥ until
after the sun had risen, and after ‘Aṣr until the sun had set, and
prostration is part of the prayer. So no one should recite any piece of
Qur’ān requiring a prostration during these two periods of time.”
Mālik was asked whether a menstruating woman could prostrate if
she heard someone reciting a passage of Qur’ān requiring a
prostration, and he said, “Neither a man nor a woman should
prostrate unless they are ritually pure.”
167

Mālik was asked whether a man in the company of a woman who
was reciting a passage of Qur’ān requiring a prostration should
prostrate with her, and he said, “He does not have to prostrate with
her. e prostration is only obligatory for people who are with a
man who is leading them. He recites the piece and they prostrate
with him. Someone who hears a piece of Qur’ān that requires a
prostration being recited by a man who is not leading him in prayer
does not have to do the prostration.”

15.6 About reciting Sūrat al-Ikhlāṣ and Sūrat al-Mulk
Y 17 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Rahmān ibn
ʿAbdullāh ibn Ṣa‘ṣa‘a from his father that Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī
heard a man reciting Sūrat al-Ikhlāṣ (112), repeating it over and over
again. In the morning he went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and
mentioned it to him as if he thought little of it. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “By the One in whose hand my self is, it is equal to
one third of the Qur’ān.”
Y 18 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Ubaydullāh ibn ʿAbd arRaḥmān that ‘Ubayd ibn Ḥunayn, the mawlā of the family of Zayd
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, mentioned that he had heard Abū Hurayra say, “I
was going along with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬when he heard a
man reciting Sūrat al-Ikhlāṣ (112). e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘It is obligatory,’ and I asked him, ‘What is, Messenger of Allah?’
and he said, ‘e Garden.’ I wanted to tell the man the good news
but I was afraid that I would miss the midday meal with the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and I preferred to eat with the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬. When I went to the man afterwards I found him gone.”
Y 19 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Ḥumayd
ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf had told him that Sūrat al-Ikhlāṣ
(112) was equal to a third of the Qur’ān and that Sūrat al-Mulk (67)
pleaded for its owner.

15.7 Dhikr (Remembrance) of Allah, the Blessed and Exalted

168

20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr, from Abū Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever says ‘ere is no god but
Allah, alone, without any partner. e Kingdom and praise belong
to Him and He has power over everything’ (Lā ilaha illā’llāh,
waḥdahu lā sharīka lah, lahu’l-mulku wa lahu’l-ḥamd, wa huwa ‘alā
kulli shay’in qadīr) one hundred times a day, it is the same for him
as freeing ten slaves. One hundred good actions are written for him
and one hundred wrong actions are erased for him, and it is a
protection from Shayṭān for that day until the night. No one does
anything more excellent than what he does except someone who
does more than that.”
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr, from Abū Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever says, ‘Glory be to Allah and
with His praise’ (Subḥāna’llāh wa bi-ḥamdihi) one hundred times in
a day will have his wrong actions taken away from him, even if they
are as abundant as the foam on the sea.”
22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū ‘Ubayd, the mawlā of

Sulaymān ibn ʿAbd al-Mālik, from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yazīd al-Laythī that
Abū Hurayra said, “Whoever says ‘Glory be to Allah’ (subḥāna’llāh)
thirty-three times and ‘Allah is Greater’ (Allāhu akbar) thirty-three
times and ‘Praise be to Allah’ (al-ḥamdu lillāh) thirty-three times,
and seals the hundred with ‘ere is no god but Allah, alone
without any partner. e Kingdom and praise belong to Him and
He has power over everything’ (Lā ilaha illā’llāh, waḥdahu la sharīka
lah, lahu’l-mulku wa lahu’l-ḥamd, wa huwa ‘alā kulli shay’in qadīr)
after every prayer will have his wrong actions forgiven him even if
they are abundant as the foam on the sea.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ‘Umāra ibn Ṣayyād heard

Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say about ‘abiding good deeds’ that they were
a slave’s saying ‘Allah is greater’ (Allāhu akbar) and ‘Glory be to
Allah’ (subḥāna’llāh) and ‘Praise be to Allah’ (al-ḥamdu lillāh) and
169

‘ere is no god but Allah and there is no power and no strength
except by Allah.’ (Lā ilaha illā’llāh wa lā ḥawla wa lā quwwata illā
bi’llāh.)
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ziyād ibn Abī Ziyād

mentioned that Abū ad-Dardā’ said, “Shall I not tell you the best of
your deeds, and those that give you the highest rank, and those that
are the purest with your King, and are better for you than giving
gold and silver, and better for you than meeting your enemy and
striking their necks?” ey answered, “Of course.” He said,
“Remembrance (dhikr) of Allah ta‘ālā.”
Ziyād ibn Abī Ziyād said that Mu‘ādh ibn Jabal said, “ere is no
action which is more likely to save one from Allah’s punishment
than remembrance (dhikr) of Allah.”
25 Mālik related to me from Nu‘aym ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Mujmir

from ‘Alī ibn Yaḥyā az-Zuraqī from his father that Rifā‘a ibn Rāﬁ‘
said, “One day we were praying behind the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬raised his head from rukū‘ and
said, ‘Allah hears the one who praises Him’ (Sami‘ Allāhu liman
ḥamidah). A man behind him said, ‘Our Lord, praise belongs to
You – blessed, pure and abundant praise’ (Rabbanā wa laka’l-ḥamd
kathīran ṭayyiban mubārakan ﬁhi). When the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬had ﬁnished, he said, ‘Who was it who spoke just now?’ e man
said, ‘I did, Messenger of Allah,’ and the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘I saw more than thirty angels rushing to see which one of
them would record it ﬁrst.’”

15.8 Du‘ā’ (supplication)
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“Every Prophet is given a supplication (du‘ā’), and I wish to preserve
my supplication as intercession for my community in the next
world.”

170

27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he had
heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to say the following

supplication: “O Allah, it is You who makes the dawn break and
makes the night a time for rest and appoints the sun and moon to
reckon by. Relieve me of debt and enrich me from poverty and let
me enjoy my hearing, my sight and my strength in Your way.”
Allāhumma fāliqa’l-iṣbāḥ, wa jā‘ila’l-layli sakana, wa’sh-shamsi wa’lqamari ḥusbāna. Iqḍa ‘anniy ad-dayna, wa’ghnaniy mina’l-faqr.
Amti‘ni bi sam’ī wa basarī wa quwwatī ﬁ sabīlik.
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“When you are making supplication do not say, ‘O Allah, forgive
me if You wish. O Allah, forgive me if You wish.’ You should be
ﬁrm in your asking, for there is no compelling Him.”
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū

‘Ubayd, the mawlā of Ibn Azhar, from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “You will be answered as long as you are
not impatient and say, ‘I have made a supplication and it has not
been answered for me.’”
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū

ʿAbdullāh al-Agharr and from Abū Salama from Abū Hurayra that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Our Lord, the Blessed and
Exalted, descends every night to the heaven of this world when the
last third of the night is still to come and says, ‘Who will call on Me
so that I may answer him? Who will ask Me so that I may give him?
Who will ask forgiveness of Me so that I may forgive him?’”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī that ‘Ā’isha, Umm
al-Mu’minīn, said, “I was sleeping by the side of the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬I missed him in the night, so I felt for him with my hand
and I put my hand on his feet and he was in sajda saying, ‘I seek
refuge in Your pleasure from Your wrath, and in Your pardon from
171

Your punishment, and in You from You. I cannot enumerate Your
praises as You praise Yourself.’”
A‘ūdhu bi riḍāka min sakhaṭika, wa bi mu‘āfātika min ‘uqūbatika wa
bika minka, la uḥṣiy thanā’an ‘alayka, anta kamā athnayta ‘alā
nafsika.
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ziyād ibn Abī Ziyād from
Ṭalḥa ibn ‘Ubaydullāh ibn Kurayz that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

said, “e best supplication is supplication on the day of ‘Arafat, and
the best thing that I or the Prophets before me have said is ‘ere is
no god but Allah, alone, without any partner’ (Lā ilaha illā’llāh,
waḥdahu lā sharīka lah.)”
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

from Ṭāwus al-Yamānī from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to teach this supplication in the same
way that he would teach them a sūra of the Qur’ān, “O Allah, I seek
refuge in You from the torment of Hellﬁre, and I seek refuge in You
from the trial of the Dajjāl, and I seek refuge in You from the trial
of life and death.”
Allāhumma inniy a‘ūdhu bika min ‘adhābi jahannama, wa a‘ūdhu
bika min ‘adhābi’l-qabri, wa a‘ūdhu bika min ﬁtnati’l-maḥyā wa

34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

from Tāwus al-Yamāni from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to say when he rose for prayer in the
middle of the night, “O Allah, praise belongs to You. You are the
light of the heavens and the earth and praise belongs to You. You are
the Sustainer of the heavens and the earth and praise belongs to
You. You are the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whoever is
in them. You are the Truth and Your words are true. Your promise is
true and the meeting with You is true. e Garden is true, the Fire
is true and the Hour is true. O Allah, I submit to You and I accept
You and I trust in You and I turn to You and I argue by You and I
172

look to You for judgement. Forgive me what I have sent before me
and what I have left behind, what I have kept secret and what I have
proclaimed, You are my god – there is no god but You.”

35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh

ibn Jābir ibn ‘Atīk said that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar had come to them
in Banū Mu‘āwiya, one of the villages of the Anṣār, and said, “Do
you know where the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed in this mosque
of yours?” I told him, “Yes,” and I pointed out a place near where he
was. He asked, “Do you know the three things for which he made
supplication here?” I answered, “Yes.” He said, “Tell me them then.”
I said, “He asked that Allah would not make an enemy from among
the non-believers triumph over the believers and that He would not
destroy the believers by bad harvests, and he was given both these
things. And he asked that He would not make the believers ﬁght
among themselves, and that was refused.” Ibn ‘Umar said, “You have
told the truth,” and he added, “ Turmoil will not cease until the Day
of Rising.”
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Zayd ibn Aslam used to say,

“No one makes a supplication without one of three things
happening: either it is answered, or it is stored up for him, or wrong
actions are expiated by it.”

15.9 Making supplication (du‘ā’)

173

ʿ

37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār said,

“ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar saw me when I was making supplication and
I was pointing with two ﬁngers, one from each hand, and he
forbade me to do that.”

38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab used to say, “A man is raised in degrees by the
supplication of his son after his death.” He spoke with his hands
turned upwards, and then lifted them up.
Y 39 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his
father said, “e following āyat was revealed about supplication: ‘Do
not be too loud in your prayer or too quiet in it, but try and ﬁnd a
way between the two.’” (17:110)
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked about making supplication in
obligatory prayers and he said, “ere is no harm in making
supplication in them.”
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to make supplication saying, “O Allah,

I ask You for good actions and for leaving what is disapproved of
and for love of the poor. And if You wish to try people, then bring
me to You without being tried.’”

Allāhumma innī asa’luka ﬁ‘la’l-khayrāti, wa tarka’l-munkarāti, wa

41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “No one calls to guidance without

having the same reward as those who follow him, without
diminishing their rewards at all. And no one calls to error without
having the same burdens as they do, without diminishing their
burdens at all.”
42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar said, “O Allah, make me one of the leaders of the people
174

of taqwā!”
Allāhumma ja‘lnī min a’immati’l-muttaqīn.
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Abū ad-

Dardā’ used to rise in the middle of the night and say, “Eyes have
slept, and stars have set, and You are the Living and SelfSubsistent.”
Nāmati’l-‘uyūnu wa ghāriti’n-nujūm wa anta’l-Ḥayyu-l-Qayyūm.
“Stars have set,” i.e. disappeared under the horizon.

15.10 Prayer forbidden after Ṣubḥ and after ‘Aṣr
44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār from ʿAbdullāh aṣ-Ṣunābiḥī that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “e sun rises and with it is the horn of Shayṭān and when
the sun gets higher the horn leaves it. en when the sun reaches
the meridian the horn joins it and when the sun declines the horn
leaves it, and when the sun has nearly set it joins it again.” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade prayer at these times.
45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his
father said that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to say, “Delay the

prayer when the edge of the sun appears until it is completely in
view, and delay the prayer when the edge of the sun is disappearing
until it has completely disappeared.”

46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that al-‘Alā’ ibn ʿAbd ar-

Rahmān said, “We visited Anas ibn Mālik after Ẓuhr and he stood
up and prayed ‘Aṣr. When he had ﬁnished his prayer, we mentioned
doing prayers early in their time, or he mentioned it, and he said
that he had heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘e prayer of the
hypocrites, the prayer of the hypocrites, the prayer of the hypocrites
is that one of them sits until the sun becomes yellow and is between
the horns of Shayṭān, or on the horn of Shayṭān, and then gets up
and rattles oﬀ four rak‘as, hardly remembering Allah in them at all.’”
ʿ
175

47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “None of you should

seek to pray as the sun is rising or as it is setting.”

48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn

Ḥabbān from al-A‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade prayer after ‘Aṣr until the sun had set, and prayer
after Ṣubḥ until the sun had risen.
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār from

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to say, “Do not
seek to do your prayer at either sunrise or sunset, for the horns of
Shaytān rise with the rising of the sun and set with its setting.”

‘Umar used to beat people for that kind of prayer.
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from as-Sā‘ib

ibn Yazīd that he saw ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb beating al-Munkadir for
praying after ‘Aṣr.

16. Burials
16.1 Washing the dead
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was washed while wearing

a long shirt.

2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ayyūb ibn Abī Tamīma as-

Sakhtiyāni from Muḥammad ibn Sīrīn that Umm ‘Aṭiyya alAnṣāriyya said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came to us when his
daughter died and said, ‘Wash her three times, or ﬁve, or more than
that if you think it necessary, with water and lotus leaves, and at the
end put on some camphor, or a little camphor, and when you have
ﬁnished let me know.’ When we ﬁnished we told him, and he gave
us his waist-wrapper and said, ‘Shroud her with this.’”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr that

Asmā’ bint ‘Umays washed Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq when he died. en
she went out and asked some of the Muhājirūn who were there, “I
am fasting and this is an extremely cold day. Do I have to do ghusl?”
ey answered, “No.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard people of

knowledge say, “When a woman dies and there are no women with
her to wash her and no man who has the right by blood ties to take
charge of that for her and no husband to take charge of it for her,
she should be puriﬁed by means of tayammum, that is, by wiping
her face and hands with earth.”
Mālik said, “When a man dies and there are only women with him,
they also should purify him with earth.”
Mālik said, “ere is no particular way with us for washing the dead
nor any recognised way to do it. ey are just washed and puriﬁed.”
177

16.2 Shrouding the dead
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his
father from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was shrouded in three Saḥūlī white cotton garments,

none of which was a long shirt or turban.

6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that he

had heard that when Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq was ill he asked ‘Ā’isha,
“How many shrouds did the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬have?” and she
replied, “ree Saḥūlī white cotton garments.” Abū Bakr said, “Take
this garment (a garment he was wearing on which red clay or
saﬀron had fallen) and wash it. en shroud me in it with two other
garments.” ‘Ā’isha said, “Why is that?” and Abū Bakr replied, “e
living have greater need of the new than the dead. is is only for
the body ﬂuids that come out as the body decays.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ḥumayd

ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ
said, “A dead man is clothed in a shirt and a waist-wrapper and then
wrapped in a third, and if he only has one garment he is shrouded in
that.”

16.3 Preceeding the bier
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, and Abū Bakr and ‘Umar as well as the

khalīfas up until this time and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar would walk in
front of the bier.

9 Yaḥyā related to me from Muḥammad ibn al-Munkadir that

Rabi‘a ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Hadīr told him that he had seen ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb leading people in front of the bier at the funeral of
Zaynab bint Jaḥsh.
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Hishām ibn ‘Urwa said, “I

only ever saw my father in front of a funeral procession.” He added,
178

“en he would come to al-Baqī‘ and sit down until the procession
passed him.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “Walking

behind the bier is contrary to the sunna.”

16.4 e prohibition against following the bier with a burning
torch
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

Asmā’ bint Abī Bakr said to her family, “Perfume my clothes with
incense when I die and then embalm me. Do not put any of the
embalming substance on my shroud, and do not follow me with a
burning torch.”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sa‘īd ibn Abī Sa‘īd al-

Maqburī that Abū Hurayra forbade anyone to follow him with a
burning torch after his death. Yaḥyā said, “I heard Mālik disapprove
of that.”

16.5 e takbīrs in funerals
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

announced the death of the Negus to the people on the day that he
died, and went out with them to the place of prayer, and then
formed them into rows and said “Allah is greater” four times.

15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Abū

Umāma ibn Sahl ibn Ḥunayf told him that once a poor woman fell
ill and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was told of her illness, and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to visit poor people frequently and ask
after them. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Let me know if she
dies.” Her bier was brought out at night-time and they did not want
to wake up the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. In the morning the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was told what had happened to her and he
said, “Did I tell not you to let me know if she died?” ey replied,
“Messenger of Allah, we did not want to wake you up and make you
179

come out in the night.” en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬went out
and formed everyone into rows by her grave and said “Allah is
greater” four times.
16 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik asked Ibn Shihāb about a man

who caught some of the takbīrs said over the corpse and missed the
rest, and Ibn Shihāb said, “He completes what he has missed.”

16.6 What to say in the prayer for the dead
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sa‘īd ibn Abī Sa‘īd al-

Maqburī from his father that he had asked Abū Hurayra, “How do
you pray over the dead?” and Abū Hurayra replied, “By the Life of
Allah, I will tell you! I follow with the family and when the corpse is
put down I say, ‘Allah is greater’ and praise Allah and ask for
blessings on His Prophet. en I say, ‘O Allah, he is Your slave and
the son of Your male slave and Your female slave. He used to testify
that there is no god but You and that Muḥammad is Your slave and
Your Messenger, and You know that best. O Allah! If he acted well,
then increase for him his good action, and if he acted wrongly, then
overlook his wrong actions. O Allah! Do not deprive us of his
reward, and do not try us after him.’”
Allāhumma innahu ʿabduka wa’bnu ʿabdika wa’bnu amatika. Kāna
yash-hadu an lā ilaha illā anta wa anna Muḥammadan ʿabduka wa
rasūluka, wa anta ‘alamu bihi. Allāhumma in kana muḥsinan zid ﬁ
iḥsānihi, wa in kāna musiyan fa tajāwaz ‘an sayyiātihi. Allāhumma la
taḥrimnā ajrahu wa lā taftinnā ba‘dahu.
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that he

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, “I once prayed behind Abū
Hurayra over a child who had never done a wrong action and I
heard him say, ‘O Allah, give him protection from the torment of
the grave.’”
“Allāhumma a‘idh hu min ‘adhāb al-qabr.”

180

ʿ

19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used not to recite Qur’ān when praying over a dead person.

16.7 Permission to pray over the dead after Ṣubḥ until the dawn
is clear and after ‘Aṣr until the sun turns yellow
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Abī

Ḥarmala, the mawlā of ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī Sufyān ibn
Ḥuwaytib, that Zaynab bint Abī Salama died during the time that
Ṭāriq was governor of Madīna and her bier was brought out after
Ṣubḥ and put in al-Baqī‘. He said that Ṭāriq used to pray Ṣubḥ right
at the beginning of its time. He added, “I heard ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar say to the family, ‘You can either pray over your dead now or
you can wait until the sun comes up.’”
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “e prayer for a dead person can be done after ‘Aṣr and
Ṣubḥ if these have been prayed at their times.”

16.8 Doing the prayer for the dead in mosques
22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of
‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬,

ordered that the body of Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ be brought past her
in the mosque so that she could make supplication for him. Some
people disapproved of her doing that, and she said, “How hasty
people are! e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬only prayed over Suhayl ibn
Bayḍā’ in the mosque.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “e prayer over ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb was done in the
mosque.”

16.9 e prayer over the dead in general
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Uthmān

ibn ‘Aﬀān, ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar and Abū Hurayra used to pray over
181

the dead, both men and women, in Madīna. ey would put the
men nearer to the imām and the women nearer to the qibla.
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar, when he prayed over the dead, would say, “Peace be upon
you” loud enough for whoever was near to him to hear.

26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “No one should pray over a dead person unless he
is in wuḍū’.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “I have not seen any person of
knowledge disapproving of praying over either a child born of
adultery or its mother.”

16.10 Burying the dead
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬died on Monday and was buried on Tuesday

and people prayed over him individually with no one leading them.
Some people said that he would be buried near the minbar, and
others said that he would be buried in al-Baqī‘. Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq
came and said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘No Prophet
was ever buried except in the place where he died.’” So a grave was
dug for him there. When he was about to be washed they wished to
take oﬀ his shirt but they heard a voice saying “Do not remove his
shirt,” so they did not take oﬀ his shirt and he ‫ ﷺ‬was washed with
it on.
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father said, “ere were two men in Madīna, one of whom dug
graves with a niche in the side wall for the body, and the other who
did not, and they said, ‘Whichever one comes ﬁrst can do the job,’
and the one who dug graves with a niche came ﬁrst and dug the
grave of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.”
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Umm
Salama, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬used to say, “I did not believe

182

that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had died until I heard the pickaxes
fall.”
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Ā’isha,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I dreamt that three moons fell into

my room, and I related my vision to Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq. en,
when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬died and was buried in my house,
Abū Bakr said to me, ‘is is one of your moons, and he is the best
of them.’”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from more than one reliable

source that Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ and Sa‘īd ibn Zayd ibn ‘Amr ibn
Nufayl died at al-‘Aqīq and were carried to Madīna and buried
there.

32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father said, “I would not want to be buried in al-Baqī‘. I would
prefer to be buried elsewhere. e one who is buried in al-Baqī‘ is
one of two people: either he is unjust (ẓālim), and I would not like
to be buried with him, or he is righteous (ṣāliḥ), and I would not
like his bones to be disturbed for me.”

16.11 Stopping for funerals and sitting in graveyards
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Wāqid ibn ‘Amr ibn Sa‘d ibn Mu‘ādh from Nāﬁ‘ ibn Jubayr ibn
Muṭ‘im from Mas‘ūd ibn al-Ḥakam from ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to stand up when a funeral procession
passed by, and then sit down again afterwards.
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Alī ibn

Abī Tālib used to rest his head on graves and lie on them.

Mālik said, “We think that it is only forbidden to sit on graves to
relieve oneself.”
35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Bakr ibn ‘Uthmān ibn

Sahl ibn Ḥunayf that he had heard Abū Umāma ibn Sahl ibn
183

Ḥunayf say, “We used to attend funeral processions, and the last of
the people would not sit until they had been given permission.”

16.12 e prohibition of weeping over the dead
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh

ibn Jābir ibn ‘Atīk that ‘Atīk ibn al-Ḥārith, the grandfather of
ʿAbdullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn Jābir on his mother’s side, told him
that Jābir ibn ‘Atīk had told him that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
came to visit ʿAbdullāh ibn ābit and found him in his deaththroes. He called to him but he did not reply. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “We belong to Allah, and to Him we are returning,”
and added, “You are being taken from us, Abū ar-Rabī‘.” e
women cried out and wept and Jābir began to silence them. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Leave them, and it is necessary, none
of the women should cry.” ey said, “Messenger of Allah, what do
you mean by ‘necessary’?” and he replied, “When he dies.” e
dying man’s daughter said, “By Allah, I hope that you will be a
martyr, for you have completed your preparations for battle,” and
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Allah has made his reward fall
according to his intention. What do you consider martyrdom to
be?” ey said, “Death in the way of Allah.” e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere are seven kinds of martyr other than those
killed in the way of Allah. Someone who is killed by the plague is a
martyr, someone who drowns is a martyr, someone who dies of
pleurisy is a martyr, someone who dies of a disease of the belly is a
martyr, someone who dies by ﬁre is a martyr, someone who dies
under a falling building is a martyr and a woman who dies in
childbirth is a martyr.”
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

from his father that ‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān told him that she
had heard ‘Ā’isha, the Umm al-Mu’minīn, say (when it was
mentioned to her that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to say, “e dead
are tormented by the weeping of the living”), “May Allah forgive
Abū ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān. Of course he has not lied, but he has
184

forgotten or made a mistake. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬passed by a
Jewish woman whose family were crying over her and he said, ‘You
are crying over her, and she is being tormented in her grave.’”

16.13 Fortitude in the face of misfortune
38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

said, “No Muslim who has three children die will be touched by the
Fire except to fulﬁl Allah’s oath.”

39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr

ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm from his father from Ibn an-Naḍr as-Salamī
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If three of a Muslim’s children
die, and he remains content with that, they will be a protection for
him from the Fire.” A woman who was with the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Or two, Messenger of Allah?” and he said, “Or two.”
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard from Abū al-

Ḥubāb Sa‘īd ibn Yasār from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e believer continues to be struck by misfortune in
his children and close friends until he meets Allah with no wrong
actions.”

16.14 Fortitude in the face of misfortune generally
41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Let the misfortune that befalls me be a comfort to the
Muslims in their misfortunes.”
42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbd arRaḥmān from Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If a misfortune befalls someone and he

says, as Allah has ordered, ‘We belong to Allah and to Him we are
returning. O Allah, reward me in my misfortune and give me better
than it afterwards,’ Allah will do that for him.” (Innā lillāhi wa innā
ilayhi rāji‘ūn. Allāhumma ijurnī fī muṣībatī, wa ‘aqibnī khayran
185

minhā.) Umm Salama said, “When Abū Salama died I said that,
and then I said, ‘Who is better than Abū Salama?’” And then Allah
left her the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he married her.
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad said, “One of my wives died and
Muḥammad ibn Ka‘b al-Quraẓī came to console me about her. He
told me of a certain man from the tribe of Israel who was a diligent,
worshipping, knowledgeable and understanding man who had a
wife that he admired and loved, and she died. He grieved over her
intensely and lamented to such an extent that he withdrew into a
room and locked himself in, hidden from everyone, and no one
visited him. A woman heard about him and went to him, saying, ‘I
need for him to give me a legal opinion. Nothing will satisfy me
except what he says about it.’ Everyone went away but she stayed at
his door and said, ‘I must speak to him.’ Someone said to him,
‘ere is a woman who wishes to ask your opinion about
something.’ She said, ‘I will only speak to him.’ When everyone had
gone away and she still had not left his door, he said, ‘Let her in.’ So
she went in and saw him and said, ‘I have come to ask your opinion
about something.’ ‘What is it?’ he asked. She said, ‘I borrowed a
piece of jewellery from a neighbour of mine, and I have worn it and
used it for a long time. en they sent to me for it. Should I let
them have it back?’ He said, ‘Yes, by Allah.’ She said, ‘I have had it
for a long time.’ He said, ‘It is more correct for you to return it to
them since they have lent it to you for such a long time.’ She said,
‘Yes. May Allah have mercy on you. Do you then grieve over what
Allah has lent you and then taken from you, when He has a greater
right to it than you?’ en he saw the situation he was in, and Allah
helped him by her words.”

16.15 Exhumation
44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Abū ar-Rijāl Muḥammad

ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān heard his mother ‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān

186

say, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬cursed both men and women who
dug up,” meaning those who dug up graves.
45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Ā’isha,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬used to say, “Breaking the bone of a

Muslim when he is dead is like breaking it when he is alive.” She
meant if done in wrong action.

16.16 Burial in general
46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

‘Abbād ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn az-Zubayr that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, told him that she had heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
say before he died, while he was leaning on her breast and she was
listening to him, “O Allah, forgive me and have mercy on me and
join me with the Highest Company.”
47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that ‘Ā’isha said,
“e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, said, ‘No prophet dies until he is given

the choice.’ She continued, “I heard him say, ‘O Allah, the Highest
Company,’ and I knew that he was going.”

48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When you die,

your place will be shown to you in the morning and the evening. If
you are one of the people of the Garden, then you will be with the
people of the Garden, and if you are one of the people of the Fire,
then you will be with the people of the Fire. You will be told, ‘is is
your place of waiting until Allah raises you on the day of rising.’”
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e

earth consumes all of the son of Ādam except the coccyx. He was
created from it, and from it he will be reconstituted.”
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān ibn Ka‘b ibn Mālik al-Anṣārī told him that his father, Ka‘b
ibn Mālik, used to relate that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e
187

soul of the believer is a bird that sits in the trees of the Garden until
Allah returns it to his body on the day He raises him.”
51 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān ibn Ka‘b ibn Mālik al-Anṣārī told him that his father, Ka‘b
ibn Mālik, used to relate that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e
soul of the believer is a bird that sits in the trees of the Garden until
Allah returns it to his body on the day He raises him.”
52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A

man said to his family that he had never done a good action, and
that when he died they were to burn him and then scatter half of
him on the land and half of him on the sea, for by Allah, if Allah
destined it for him, He would punish him with a punishment which
He had not punished anyone else with in all the worlds. When the
man died, they did as he had told them. en Allah told the land to
collect everything that was in it, and told the sea to collect
everything that was in it, and then He said to the man, ‘Why did
you do this?’ and he said, ‘From fear of You, Lord, and You know
best.’”
Abū Hurayra added, “And He forgave him.”
53 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinad from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“Every child is born in the ﬁṭra (natural form) and it is his parents
who make him a Jew or a Christian. It is just as a camel is born
whole – do you perceive any defect?” ey asked, “Messenger of
Allah, what happens to people who die when they are (very)
young?” He replied, “Allah knows best what they used to do.”
54 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e

Final Hour will not come until a man passes by the grave of another
and says, ‘If only I were in his place.’”

188

55 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn

Ḥalḥala ad-Dīlī from Ma‘bad ibn Ka‘b ibn Mālik that Abū Qatāda
ibn Rib‘ī used to relate that a funeral procession passed by the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he said, “One is relieved and another
others are relieved from.” ey said, “Who is the one relieved and
the one from whom others are relieved?” He said, “A slave who is a
believer is the one who is relieved from the exhaustion and suﬀering
of this world to the mercy of Allah, and a wrong-acting slave is the
one from whom people, towns, trees and animals are relieved.”
56 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of
‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, said that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said

when ‘Uthmān ibn Maẓ‘ūn’s funeral procession passed by him, “You
have gone and you were not involved in any of it.”

57 Mālik related to me from ‘Alqama ibn Abī ‘Alqama that his
mother said that she had heard ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬,
say, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬rose one night and put on his

clothes and then went out. I ordered my slave-girl, Barīra, to follow
him, and she followed him until he got to al-Baqī‘. He stood near it
as long as Allah willed and then he left. Barīra arrived back before
him and told me and I did not say anything to him until morning,
and then I mentioned it to him and he explained, ‘I was sent out to
the people of al-Baqī‘ to pray for them.’”
58 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Abū Hurayra

said, “Make your funerals speedy, for it is only good that you are
advancing him towards, or evil that you are taking oﬀ your necks.”

17. Zakāt
17.1 ings subject to zakāt
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Amr ibn Yaḥyā al-Māzinī

that his father said that he had heard Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī say that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere is no zakāt due on less than
ﬁve camels, there is no zakāt due on less than ﬁve awāq (two
hundred dirhams of pure silver) and there is no zakāt due on less
than ﬁve awsāq (three hundred ṣā‘s).”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdullāh

ibn ʿAbd ar-Rahmān ibn Abī Ṣa‘ṣa‘a al-Anṣārī from al-Māzinī from
his father from Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, “ere is no zakāt due on less than ﬁve awsāq of dates, there is
no zakāt due on less than ﬁve awāq of silver and there is no zakāt
due on less than ﬁve camels.”

3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

ʿAbd al-‘Azīz wrote to his governor in Damascus about zakāt
saying, “Zakāt is paid on the produce of cultivated land, on gold and
silver, and on livestock.”

Mālik said, “Zakāt is only paid on three things: the produce of
cultivated land, gold and silver, and livestock.”

17.2 e zakāt on gold and silver coins
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Muḥammad ibn ‘Uqba, the

mawlā of az-Zubayr, asked al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad whether he
had to pay any zakāt on a large sum given to him by his slave to buy
his freedom. Al-Qāsim said, “Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq did not take zakāt
190

from anyone’s property until it had been in his possession for a
year.”
Al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad continued, “When Abū Bakr gave men
their stipends he would ask them, ‘Do you have any property on
which zakāt is due?’ If they said, ‘Yes,’ he would take the zakāt on
that property out of their stipends. If they said, ‘No,’ he would hand
over their stipends to them without deducting anything from them.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Urwa ibn Husayn from

‘Ā’isha bint Qudāma that her father said, “When I used to come to
‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān to collect my stipend he would ask me, ‘Do you
have any property on which zakāt is due?’ If I answered, ‘Yes,’ he
would deduct the zakāt on that property from my stipend, and if I
said, ‘No,’ he would pay me my stipend (in full).”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Zakāt is not due on property until it has been in
one’s possession for a year.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “e ﬁrst

person to deduct zakāt from stipends was Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī
Sufyān.” (i.e. the deduction being made automatically).
Mālik said, “e agreed sunna with us is that zakāt has to be paid
on twenty dinars (of gold coin) in the same way as it has to be paid
on two hundred dirhams (of silver).”
Mālik said, “ere is no zakāt to pay on (gold) that is clearly less
than twenty dinars (in weight) but if it increases so that by the
increase the amount reaches a full twenty dinars in weight then
zakāt has to be paid. Similarly there is no zakāt to pay on (silver)
that is clearly less than two hundred dirhams (in weight), but if it
increases so that by the increase the amount reaches a full two
hundred dirhams in weight then zakāt has to be paid. If it passes the
full weight, then I think there is zakāt to pay whether it be dinars or

191

dirhams.” (i.e. the zakāt is assessed by the weight and not the
number of the coins.)
Mālik said that a man who had one hundred and sixty dirhams by
weight when the exchange rate in his town was eight dirhams to a
dinar did not have to pay any zakāt. Zakāt had only to be paid on
twenty dinars of gold or two hundred dirhams.
Mālik said about the case of a man who acquired ﬁve dinars from a
transaction, or in some other way, which he then invested in trade,
that, as soon as it increased to a zakatable amount and a year had
elapsed since the original transaction, he had to pay zakāt on it, even
if the zakatable amount was reached one day before or one day after
the passing of a year. ere was then no zakāt to pay on it from the
day the zakāt was taken until a year had elapsed over it.
Mālik said about the similar case of a man who had in his
possession ten dinars which he invested in trade, and which reached
twenty dinars by the time one year had elapsed over them, that he
paid zakāt on them right then and did not wait until a year had
elapsed over them, (counting) from the day when they actually
reached the zakatable amount. is was because a year had elapsed
over the original dinars and there were now twenty of them in his
possession. ere was then no zakāt to pay on it until a year after
the day it reached the zakatable amount.
Mālik said, “What we are agreed upon (here in Madīna) regarding
income from hiring out slaves, rent from property, and the
instalments received when a slave buys his freedom, is that no zakāt
is due on any of it, whether great or small, from the day the owner
takes possession of it until a year has elapsed over it from the day
when the owner takes possession of it.”
Mālik said, in the case of gold and silver which was shared between
two co-owners, that zakāt was due from anyone whose share
reached twenty dinars of gold or two hundred dirhams of silver, and
that no zakāt was due from anyone whose share fell short of this
192

zakatable amount. If all the shares reached the zakatable amount
and the shares were not equally divided, zakāt was taken from each
man according to the measure of his share. is applied only when
the share of each man among them reached the zakatable amount,
because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere is no zakāt on less
than ﬁve awāq of silver.”
Mālik commented, “is is what I prefer most out of what I have
heard about the matter.”
Mālik said, “When a man has gold and silver dispersed among
various people he must add it all up together and then take out the
zakāt due on the total sum.”
Mālik said, “No zakāt is due from someone who acquires gold or
silver until a year has elapsed since the day he acquired it.”

17.3 Zakāt on mines
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbd arRaḥmān from more than one source that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

assigned the mines of al-Qabaliyya, which lie in the direction of alFur‘, to Bilāl ibn Ḥārith al-Māzinī, and nothing except zakāt has
been taken from them up to this day.

Mālik said, “In my opinion, and Allah knows best, nothing is taken
from what comes out of mines until what comes out of them
reaches a value of twenty gold dinars or two hundred silver dirhams.
When it reaches that amount there is zakāt to pay on it where it is
on the spot. Zakāt is levied on anything over that according to how
much of it there is, as long as there continues to be a supply from
the mine. If the vein runs out and then, after a while, more becomes
obtainable, the new supply is dealt with in the same way as the ﬁrst,
and payment of zakāt on it is begun as it was begun on the original
supply.”
Mālik said, “Mines are dealt with like crops, and the same procedure
is applied to both. Zakāt is deducted from what comes out of a
193

mine on the day it comes out without waiting for a year, just as a
tenth is taken from a crop at the time it is harvested without waiting
for a year to elapse over it.”

17.4 Zakāt on buried treasure (rikāz)
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab and from Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere is a tax of a
ﬁfth due on buried treasure.”
Mālik said, “e position which we are agreed upon, and which I
have heard the people of knowledge mentioning, is that rikāz refers
to treasure which has been found which was buried during the
Jāhiliyya, as long as neither capital is required, nor is expense, great
labour or inconvenience incurred in recovering it. If capital is
required or great labour is incurred, or on one occasion the mark is
hit and on another it is missed, then it is not rikāz.”

17.5 Non-zakatable items of jewelry, bits of gold and silver, and
amber
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Rahmān ibn alQāsim from his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, used

to look after the orphaned daughters of her brother in her house.
ey had jewellery (which they wore) and she did not pay zakāt on
this jewelry of theirs.
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to adorn his daughters and slave-girls with gold
jewellery and he did not take any zakāt on their jewellery.
Mālik said, “Anyone who has unminted gold or silver, or gold and
silver jewellery which is not used for wearing, must pay zakāt on it
every year. It is weighed and one-fortieth is taken unless it falls
short of twenty dinars of gold or two hundred dirhams of silver, in
which case there is no zakāt to pay. Zakāt is paid only when
jewellery is kept for purposes other than wearing. Bits of gold and
194

silver or broken jewellery which the owner intends to mend to wear
are in the same position as goods which are worn by their owner –
no zakāt has to be paid on them by the owner.”
Mālik said, “ere is no zakāt (to pay) on pearls, musk or amber.”

17.6 Zakāt on the property of orphans and trading for orphans
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Trade with the property of orphans and then it will
not be eaten away by zakāt.”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim that his father said, “‘Ā’isha used to look after me and one of
my brothers – we were orphans – in her house, and she would take
the zakāt from our property.”
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Ā’isha,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, used to give the property of the orphans

that were in her house to whoever would use it to trade with on
their behalf.
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd bought

some property on behalf of his brother’s sons who were orphans in
his house, and that the property was sold afterwards for a great deal
of proﬁt.
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in using the property of orphans to
trade with on their behalf if the one in charge of them has
permission to do so. Furthermore, I do not think that he is subject
to any liability.”

17.7 Zakāt on inheritance
16 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “I consider that if a man dies

and he has not paid zakāt on his property, then zakāt is taken from
the third of his property (from which he can make bequests), and
the third is not exceeded and the zakāt is given priority over
195

bequests. In my opinion it is the same as if he had a debt, which is
why I think it should be given priority over bequests.”
Mālik continued, “is applies if the deceased has asked for the
zakāt to be deducted. If the deceased has not asked for it to be
deducted, but his family do so, then that is good, but it is not
binding upon them if they do not do it.”
Mālik continued, “e sunna which we are all agreed upon is that
zakāt is not due from someone who inherits a debt (i.e. wealth that
was owed to the deceased), or goods, or a house, or a male or female
slave, until a year has elapsed over the price realised from whatever
he sells (i.e. slaves or a house which are not zakatable) or over the
wealth he inherits, from the day he sold the things or took
possession of them.”
Mālik said, “e sunna with us is that zakāt does not have to be
paid on wealth that is inherited until a year has elapsed over it.”

17.8 Zakāt on debts
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from as-Sā‘ib

ibn Yazīd that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān used to say, “is is the month in
which you pay your zakāt. If you have any debts then pay them oﬀ
so that you can sort out your wealth and take the zakāt from it.”

18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ayyūb ibn Abī Tamīma as-

Sakhtayānī that ‘Umar ibn ʿAbd al-‘Azīz wrote an order that some
property, which one of his governors had collected unjustly, be
returned to its owner and that zakāt be taken from it for the years
that had passed. en shortly afterwards he revised his order with a
message that zakāt should only taken from it once since it was a bad
debt.
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn Khuṣayfa that he

had asked Sulaymān ibn Yasār whether zakāt was due from a man
who had wealth in hand but also owed a debt for the same amount,
and he replied, “No.”
196

Mālik said, “Our position, about which we have no disagreement,
concerning a debt is that the lender of it does not pay zakāt on it
until he gets it back. Even if it stays with the borrower for a number
of years before the lender collects it, the lender only has to pay zakāt
on it once. If he collects an amount of the debt which is not
zakatable, and has other wealth which is zakatable, then what he has
collected of the debt is added to the rest of his wealth and he pays
zakāt on the total sum.”
Mālik continued, “If he has no ready money other than that which
he has collected from his debt, and that does not reach a zakatable
amount, then he does not have to pay any zakāt. He must, however,
keep a record of the amount that he has collected and if, later, he
collects another amount which, when added to what he has already
collected, brings zakāt into eﬀect, then he has to pay zakāt on it.”
Mālik continued, “Zakāt is due on this ﬁrst amount, together with
what he has further collected of the debt owed to him, regardless of
whether or not he has used up what he ﬁrst collected. If what he
takes back reaches twenty dinars of gold or two hundred dirhams of
silver, he pays zakāt on it. He pays zakāt on anything else he takes
back after that, whether it be a large or small amount, according to
the amount.”
Mālik said, “What shows that zakāt is only taken once from a debt,
which is out of hand for some years before it is recovered, is that if
goods remain with a man for trading purposes for some years before
he sells them, he only has to pay zakāt on their prices once. is is
because the one who is owed the debt or owns the goods should not
have to take the zakāt on the debt or the goods from anything else,
since the zakāt on anything is only taken from the thing itself and
not from anything else.”
Mālik said, “Our position regarding someone who owes a debt and
has goods which are worth enough to pay oﬀ the debt, and who also
has an amount of ready money which is zakatable, is that he pays
zakāt on the ready money which he has to hand. If, however, he
197

only has enough goods and ready money to pay oﬀ the debt, then he
does not have to pay any zakāt. But if the ready money that he has
reaches a zakatable amount over and above the amount of the debt
that he owes, then he must pay zakāt on it.”

17.9 Zakāt on merchandise
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

Zurayq ibn Ḥayyān, who was in charge of admission to Egypt in the
time of al-Walīd, Sulaymān, and ‘Umar ibn ʿAbd al-‘Azīz,
mentioned that ‘Umar ibn ʿAbd al-‘Azīz had written to him saying,
“Assess the Muslims that pass you and take from their apparent
wealth and whatever merchandise is in their charge, one dinar for
every forty dinars, and the same proportion from what is less than
that down to twenty dinars, and if the amount falls short of that by
one third of a dinar then leave it and do not take anything from it.
As for the People of the Book that pass you, take from the
merchandise in their charge one dinar for every twenty dinars and
the same proportion from what is less than that down to ten dinars,
and if the amount falls short by one third of a dinar, leave it and do
not take anything from it. Give them a receipt for what you have
taken from them until the same time next year.”
Mālik said, “e position among us (in Madīna) concerning goods
with a constant turnover is that if a man pays zakāt on his wealth
and then buys goods with it, whether cloth, slaves or something
similar, and then sells them before a year has elapsed over them, he
does not pay zakāt on that wealth until a year elapses over it from
the day he paid zakāt on it. He does not have to pay zakāt on any of
the goods if he does not sell them for some years, and even if he
keeps them for a very long time he still only has to pay zakāt on
them once when he sells them.”
Mālik said, “e position among us concerning a man who uses
gold or silver to buy wheat, dates, or whatever, for trading purposes
and keeps that until a year has elapsed over it and then sells it, is
that he only has to pay zakāt on it at the time when he sells it, if the
198

price reaches a zakatable amount. is is therefore not the same as
the harvest crops that a man reaps from his land, or the dates that
he harvests from his palms.”
Mālik said, “A man who has wealth which he invests in trade, but
which does not realise a zakatable proﬁt for him, ﬁxes a month in
the year when he takes stock of what goods he has for trading, and
counts the gold and silver that he has in ready money, and if all of it
comes to a zakatable amount he then pays zakāt on it.”
Mālik said, “e position is the same for Muslims who trade and
Muslims who do not. ey only have to pay zakāt once in any one
year, whether they trade in that year or not.”

17.10 Wealth which has been hidden away (kanz)
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār said, “I

heard ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar being asked what kanz was and he said,
‘It is wealth on which zakāt has not been paid.’”
22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār from

Abū aṣ-Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān that Abū Hurayra used to say, “Anyone
who has wealth on which he has not paid zakāt will, on the Day of
Rising, ﬁnd that his wealth will take the form of a white-headed
serpent with two black spots over its eyes which will seek him out
until it has him in its power, saying, ‘I am the wealth that you had
hidden away.’”

17.11 Zakāt on livestock
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had read what ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb had written about zakāt, and in it he found:

“In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate
e Book of Zakāt

199

On twenty-four camels or less zakāt is paid in sheep, one ewe for
every ﬁve camels.
On anything above that, up to thirty-ﬁve camels, a she-camel in its
second year, and, if there is no she-camel in its second year, a male
camel in its third year.
On anything above that, up to forty-ﬁve camels, a she-camel in its
third year.
On anything above that, up to sixty camels, a she-camel in its fourth
year that is ready to be sired.
On anything above that, up to seventy-ﬁve camels, a she-camel in
its ﬁfth year.
On anything above that, up to ninety camels, two she-camels in
their third year.
On anything above that, up to one hundred and twenty camels, two
she-camels in their fourth year that are ready to be sired.
On any number of camels above that, for every forty camels, a shecamel in its third year, and for every ﬁfty, a she-camel in its fourth
year.
On grazing sheep and goats, if they come to forty or more, up to
one hundred and twenty head, one ewe.
On anything above that, up to two hundred head, two ewes.
On anything above that, up to three hundred, three ewes.
On anything above that, for every hundred, one ewe.
A ram should not be taken for zakāt, nor an old or injured ewe,
except as the zakāt -collector thinks ﬁt. ose separated should not
be gathered together, nor should those gathered together be

200

separated, in order to avoid paying zakāt. Whatever belongs to two
associates is settled between them proportionately.
On silver, if it reaches ﬁve awāq, one fortieth is paid.”

17.12 Zakāt on cattle
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd ibn Qays al-

Makkī from Ṭāwus al-Yamānī that from thirty cows, Mu‘ādh ibn
Jabal took one cow in its second year, and from forty cows, one cow
in its third or fourth year, and when less than that (i.e. thirty cows)
was brought to him he refused to take anything from it. He said, “I
have not heard anything about it from the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.
When I meet him, I will ask him.” But the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
died before Mu‘ādh ibn Jabal returned.
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e best that I have heard about
someone who has sheep or goats with two or more shepherds in
diﬀerent places is that they are added together and the owner then
pays the zakāt on them. is is the same situation as a man who has
gold and silver scattered in the hands of various people. He must
add it all up and pay whatever zakāt there is to pay on the sum
total.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about a man who had both sheep and
goats, saying that they were added up together for the zakāt to be
assessed, and if, between them, they came to a number on which
zakāt was due, he paid zakāt on them. Mālik added, “ey are all
considered as a single category as ‘sheep’, and in ‘Umar al-Khaṭṭāb’s
letter it says, ‘On grazing sheep and goats, if they come to forty or
more, one ewe is owed.’”
Mālik said, “If there are more sheep than goats and their owner only
has to pay one ewe, the zakāt collector takes the ewe from the
sheep. If there are more goats than sheep, he takes it from the goats.
If there is an equal number of sheep and goats, he takes the ewe
from whichever kind he wishes.”
201

Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “Similarly, Dromedary and Bactrian
camels are added up together in order to assess the zakāt that the
owner has to pay. ey are all considered as camels. If there are
more Dromedaries than Bactrians and the owner only has to pay
one camel, the zakāt collector takes it from the Dromedaries. If,
however, there are more Bactrian camels he takes it from those. If
there is an equal number of both, he takes the camel from
whichever kind he wishes.”
Mālik said, “Similarly, cows and water buﬀalo are added up together
and are all considered as cattle. If there are more cows than water
buﬀalo and the owner only has to pay one cow, the zakāt collector
takes it from the cows. If there are more water buﬀalo, he takes it
from them. If there is an equal number of both, he takes the cow
from whichever kind he wishes. So if zakāt is necessary, it is
assessed taking both kinds as one group.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “No zakāt is due from anyone who
comes into possession of livestock, whether camels or cattle or sheep
and goats, until a year has elapsed over them from the day he
acquired them, unless he already has in his possession a zakatable
number of livestock (i.e. ﬁve camels, or thirty cattle, or forty sheep
and goats). If he already has ﬁve camels, or thirty cattle, or forty
sheep and goats, and he then acquires additional camels, or cattle, or
sheep and goats, either by trade, or gift, or inheritance, he must pay
zakāt on them when he pays zakāt on the livestock he already has,
even if a year has not elapsed over the acquisition. And even if the
additional livestock that he acquires has had zakāt taken from it the
day before he bought it or the day before he inherited it, he must
still pay zakāt on it when he pays zakāt on the livestock he already
has.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “is is the same situation as someone
who has some silver on which he pays zakāt and then uses to buy
some goods with from somebody else. He then has to pay zakāt on
those goods when he sells them. It could be that one man will have
202

to pay zakāt on them one day, and by the following day the other
man will also have to pay.”
Mālik said about the case of a man who had sheep and goats which
did not reach the zakatable amount and who then bought or
inherited an additional number of sheep and goats well above the
zakatable amount, that he did not have to pay zakāt on all his sheep
and goats until a year had elapsed over them from the day he
acquired the new animals, whether he bought them or inherited
them. is was because none of the livestock that a man had,
whether it be camels, or cattle, or sheep and goats, was counted as a
zakatable amount (niṣāb) until there was enough of any one kind for
him to have to pay zakāt on it. is was the niṣāb which was used
for assessing the zakāt on what the owner had additionally acquired,
whether it were a large or small amount of livestock.
Mālik said, “If a man has enough camels, or cattle, or sheep and
goats, for him to have to pay zakāt on each kind, and then he
acquires another camel, or cow, or sheep, or goat, it must be
included with the rest of his animals when he pays zakāt on them.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “is is what I like most out of what I
heard about the matter.”
Mālik said about the case of a man who does not have the animal
required of him for the zakāt, “If it is a two-year-old she-camel that
he does not have, a three-year-old male camel is taken instead. If it
is a three or four or ﬁve-year-old she-camel that he does not have,
then he must buy the required animal so that he gives the collector
what is due. I do not like it if the owner gives the collector the
equivalent value.”
Mālik said about camels used for carrying water and cattle used for
working water-wheels or ploughing, “I think that zakāt is paid on all
such animals when zakāt is due on them.”

17.13 Zakāt of associates
203

25 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said concerning two associates, “If they

share the same herdsman, one male animal, the same pasture and
the same watering-place, then the two men are associates as long as
each one of them can distinguish his own property from that of his
companion. If someone cannot tell his property apart from that of
his fellow, he is not an associate but a co-owner.”
Mālik said, “It is not obligatory for both associates to pay zakāt
unless both of them have a zakatable amount (of livestock). If, for
instance, one of the associates has forty or more sheep and goats and
the other has less than forty sheep and goats, then the one who has
forty has to pay zakāt and the one who has less does not. If both of
them have a zakatable amount (of livestock) then both of them are
assessed together (i.e. the ﬂock is assessed as one) and both of them
have to pay zakāt. If one of them has a thousand sheep, or less, that
he has to pay zakāt on, and the other has forty, or more, then they
are associates, and each one pays his contribution according to the
number of animals he has – so much from the one with a thousand,
and so much from the one with forty.”
Mālik said, “Two associates in camels are the same as two associates
in sheep and goats, and, for the purposes of zakāt, they are assessed
together if each one of them has a zakatable amount (of camels).
at is because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘ere is no zakāt
on less than ﬁve head of camels,’ and ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, ‘On
grazing sheep and goats, if they come to forty or more – one ewe.’”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “is is what I like most out of what I
have heard about the matter.”
Mālik said that when ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Animals which
are separated should not be gathered together nor should those
gathered together be separated in order to avoid paying zakāt,” what
he meant was the owners of livestock.
Mālik said, “What he meant when he said, ‘Animals which are
separated should not be gathered together’ is, for instance, that there
204

is a group of three men, each of whom has forty sheep and goats,
and each of whom thus has to pay zakāt. en, when the zakāt
collector is on his way, they gather their ﬂocks together so that they
only owe one ewe between them. ey are forbidden to do that.
“What he meant when he said, ‘nor should those gathered together
be separated,’ is, for instance, that there are two associates, each one
of whom has a hundred and one sheep and goats, and each of whom
must therefore pay three ewes. en, when the zakāt collector is on
his way, they split up their ﬂocks so that they only have to pay one
ewe each. ey are forbidden to do that. And thus it is said,
‘Animals which are separated should not be gathered together nor
should those gathered together be separated in order to avoid paying
zakāt.’”
Mālik said, “is is what I have heard about the matter.”

17.14 Counting lambs and kids when assessing zakāt
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī

from a son of ʿAbdullāh ibn Sufyān ath-aqafī from his
grandfather Sufyān ibn ʿAbdullāh that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb once
sent him to collect zakāt. He used to include sakhlas (when
assessing zakāt), and they said, “Do you include sakhlas even though
you do not take them (as payment)?” He returned to ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb and mentioned that to him and ‘Umar said, “Yes, you
include a sakhla which the shepherd is carrying, but you do not take
it. Neither do you take an akūla, or a rubbā, or a mākhiḍ, or rams.
You take goats in their second and third years, and this is a just
compromise between the young of sheep and goats and the best of
them.”

Mālik said, “A sakhla is a new-born lamb or kid. A rubbā is a
mother that is looking after her oﬀspring, a mākhiḍ is a pregnant
ewe or goat, and an akūla is a sheep or goat that is being fattened for
meat.”

205

Mālik said about a man who had sheep and goats on which he did
not have to pay any zakāt, but which increased by birth to a
zakatable amount on the day before the zakāt collector came to
them, “If the number of sheep and goats along with their (newborn) oﬀspring reaches a zakatable amount then the man has to pay
zakāt on them. at is because the oﬀspring of the sheep are part of
the ﬂock itself. It is not the same situation as when someone
acquires sheep by buying them, or is given them, or inherits them.
Rather, it is like when merchandise whose value does not come to a
zakatable amount is sold, and with the proﬁt that accrues it then
comes to a zakatable amount. e owner must then pay zakāt on
both his proﬁt and his original capital, taken together. If his proﬁt
had been a chance acquisition or an inheritance he would not have
had to pay zakāt on it until one year had elapsed over it from the
day he had acquired it or inherited it.”
Mālik said, “e young of sheep and goats are part of the ﬂock in
the same way that proﬁt from wealth is part of that wealth. ere is,
however, one diﬀerence, in that when a man has a zakatable amount
of gold and silver and then acquires an additional amount of wealth,
he leaves aside the wealth he has acquired and does not pay zakāt on
it when he pays the zakāt on his original wealth but waits until a
year has elapsed over what he has acquired from the day he acquired
it. Whereas a man who has a zakatable amount of sheep and goats,
or cattle, or camels, and then acquires another camel, cow, sheep or
goat, pays zakāt on it at the same time that he pays the zakāt on the
others of its kind, if he already has a zakatable amount of livestock
of that particular kind.”
Mālik said, “is is the best of what I have heard about this.”

17.15 Zakāt when two years are assessed together
27 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e position with us concerning a

man who has zakāt to pay on one hundred camels but then the
zakāt collector does not come to him until zakāt is due for a second
time and by that time all his camels have died except ﬁve, is that the
206

zakāt collector assesses the two amounts of zakāt that are due from
the owner of the animals from the ﬁve camels, which in this case is
only two sheep, one for each year. is is because the only zakāt
which an owner of livestock has to pay is what is due from him on
the day that the zakāt is (actually) assessed. His livestock may have
died or it may have increased, and the zakāt collector only assesses
the zakāt on what he (actually) ﬁnds in his possession, and if his
livestock has died, or several payments of zakāt are due from him
and nothing is taken until all his livestock has died, or has been
reduced to an amount below that on which he has to pay zakāt, then
he does not have to pay any zakāt, and there is no liability (on him)
for what has died or for the years that have passed.

17.16 e prohibition of making things diﬃcult for people in
taking zakāt
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān from al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad
that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “Sheep from the zakāt
were brought past ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and he saw amongst them a
sheep with a large udder, ready to give milk, and he asked, ‘What is
this sheep doing here?’ and they replied, ‘It is one of the sheep from
the zakāt.’ ‘Umar said, ‘e owners did not give this sheep willingly.
Do not subject people to trials. Do not take from the Muslims those
of their animals which are the best food-producers.’”
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān said, “Two men from the Ashja‘
tribe told me that Muḥammad ibn Maslama al-Anṣārī used to come
to them to collect their zakāt, and he would say to anyone who
owned livestock, ‘Select (the animal for) the zakāt due on your
livestock and bring it to me,’ and he would accept any sheep that
was brought to him provided it met the requirements of what the
man owed.”
Mālik said, “e sunna with us, and what I have seen the people of
knowledge doing in our city, is that things are not made diﬃcult for
207

the Muslims in their paying zakāt, and whatever they oﬀer of their
livestock is accepted from them.”

17.17 Receiving zakāt, and who is permitted to receive it
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Zakāt is not permissible for

someone who is not in need except in ﬁve cases: someone ﬁghting in
the way of Allah, someone who collects zakāt, someone in debt,
someone who buys it with his own money, and someone who has a
poor neighbour who receives some zakāt and gives some as a present
to the one who is not in need.”

Mālik said, “e position with us concerning the dividing up of
zakāt is that it is up to the individual judgement of the man in
charge (wālī). Whichever categories of people are in most need and
are most numerous are given preference, according to how the man
in charge sees ﬁt. It is possible that it may change after one year, or
two, or more, but it is always those who are in need and are most
numerous that are given preference, whatever category they may
belong to. is is what I have seen done by people of knowledge
with whom I am satisﬁed.”
Mālik said, “ere is no ﬁxed share for the collector of the zakāt,
except according to what the ruler sees ﬁt.”

17.18 Collecting zakāt and being ﬁrm in doing so
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Abū Bakr

aṣ-Ṣiddīq said, “If they withhold even a hobbling cord I will ﬁght
them over it.”
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Zayd ibn Aslam said,

“‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb drank some milk which he liked (very much)
and he asked the man who had given it to him, ‘Where did this
milk come from?’ e man told him that he had come to a
208

watering-place, which he named, and had found grazing livestock
from the zakāt watering there. He was given some of their milk,
which he then put into his water-skin, and that was the milk in
question. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb then put his hand into his mouth to
make himself vomit.”
Mālik said, “e position with us is that if anyone refuses to honour
one of the obligatory demands of Allah, and the Muslims are unable
to get it, then they have the right to ﬁght him until they get it from
him.”
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that one of the

administrators of ‘Umar ibn ʿAbd al-‘Azīz wrote to him mentioning
that a man had refused to pay zakāt on his property. ‘Umar wrote to
the administrator and told him to leave the man alone and not to
take any zakāt from him when he took it from the other Muslims.
e man heard about this and the situation became unbearable for
him, and after that he paid the zakāt on his property. e
administrator wrote to ‘Umar and mentioned that to him, and
‘Umar wrote back telling him to take the zakāt from him.

17.19 Zakāt on estimated yields of date-palms and vines
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from a reliable source from

Sulaymān ibn Yasār and from Busr ibn Sa‘īd that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere is a tenth (‘ushr) due on land that is watered
by rain or springs or any natural means. ere is half of an ‘ushr (a
twentieth) on irrigated land.”

35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ziyād ibn Sa‘d that Ibn

Shihāb said, “Neither ju‘rūr, nor muṣrān al-fāra, nor ‘adhq ibn
ḥubayq should be taken as zakāt from dates. ey should be
included in the assessment but not taken as zakāt.”
Mālik said, “is is the same as with sheep and goats, whose young
are included in the assessment but are not (actually) taken as zakāt.
ere are also certain kinds of fruit which are not taken as zakāt,
209

such as burdī dates (one of the ﬁnest kinds of dates), and similar
varieties.
“Neither the lowest quality (of any property) nor the highest should
be taken. Rather, zakāt should be taken from average quality
property.”
Mālik said, “e position that we are agreed upon concerning fruit
is that only dates and grapes are estimated while still on the trees.
ey are estimated when their usability is clear and they are lawful
to sell. is is because the fruit of date-palms and vines is eaten
straightaway in the form of fresh dates and grapes, and so the
assessment is done by estimation to make things easier for people
and to avoid causing them trouble. eir produce is estimated and
then they are given a free hand in using their produce as they wish,
and later they pay the zakāt on it according to the estimation that
was made.”
Mālik said, “Crops which are not eaten fresh, such as grains and
seeds, which are only eaten after they have been harvested, are not
estimated. e owner, after he has harvested, threshed and sifted
the crop, so that it is then in the form of grain or seed, has to fulﬁl
his trust himself and deduct the zakāt he owes if the amount is large
enough for him to have to pay zakāt. is is the position about
which there is no disagreement here (in Madīna).”
Mālik said, “e position that we are all agreed upon here (in
Madīna) is that the produce of date-palms is estimated while it is
still on the trees, after it has ripened and become lawful to sell, and
the zakāt on it is deducted in the form of dried dates at the time of
harvest. If the fruit is damaged after it has been estimated, and the
damage aﬀects all the fruit, then no zakāt has to be paid. If some of
the fruit remains unaﬀected, and this fruit amounts to ﬁve awsāq or
more using the ṣā‘ of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, then zakāt is deducted from it.
Zakāt does not have to be paid, however, on the fruit that was
damaged. Grape-vines are dealt with in the same way.
210

“If a man owns various pieces of property in various places, or is a
co-owner of various pieces of property in various places, none of
which individually comes to a zakatable amount, but which, when
added together, do come to a zakatable amount, then he adds them
together and pays the zakāt that is due on them.”

17.20 Zakāt on seeds and olives
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he asked Ibn Shihāb about

olives and he said, “ere is a tenth due on them.”

Mālik said, “e tenth that is taken from olives is taken after they
have been pressed, and the olives must reach a minimum amount of
ﬁve awsāq. If there are less than ﬁve awsāq of olives, no zakāt has to
be paid. Olive trees are like date-palms in so far as there is a tenth
on whatever is watered by rain or springs or any natural means, and
a twentieth on whatever is irrigated. Olives, however, are not
estimated while still on the trees.
“e sunna with us concerning grain and seeds which people store
and eat is that a tenth is taken from whatever has been watered by
rain or springs or any natural means, and a twentieth from whatever
has been irrigated, that is, as long as the amount comes to ﬁve awsāq
or more using the aforementioned ṣā‘, that is, the ṣā‘ of the Prophet
‫ﷺ‬. Zakāt must be paid on anything above ﬁve awsāq according to
the amount involved.”
Mālik said, “e categories of grain and seeds which are subject to
zakāt are: wheat, barley, sult (a kind of barley), sorghum, pearl
millet, rice, lentils, peas, beans, sesame seeds and other such grains
and seeds which are used for food. Zakāt is taken from them after
they have been harvested and are in the form of grain or seed.”
He said, “People are entrusted with the assessment and whatever
they hand over is accepted.”
Mālik was asked whether the tenth or the twentieth was taken out
of olives before they were sold or after and he said, “e sale is not
211

taken into consideration. It is the people who produce the olives
that are asked about the olives, just as it is the people who produce
foodstuﬀs that are asked about it, and zakāt is taken from them on
the basis of what they say. Someone who gets ﬁve awsāq or more of
olives from his olive trees has a tenth taken from the oil after
pressing. Whereas someone who does not get ﬁve awsāq from his
trees does not have to pay any zakāt on the oil.”
Mālik said, “Someone who sells his crops when they are ripe and are
ready in the husk has to pay zakāt on them but the one who buys
them does not. e sale of crops is not valid until they are ready in
the husk and no longer need water.”
Mālik said, concerning the words of Allah the Exalted, “pay their
due on the day of their harvest,” (6:141), that it referred to zakāt, and
that he had heard people saying that.
Mālik said, “If someone sells his garden or his land, on which are
crops or fruit which have not yet ripened, then it is the buyer who
has to pay the zakāt. If, however, they have ripened, it is the seller
who has to pay the zakāt, unless paying the zakāt is one of the
conditions of the sale.”

17.21 Non-zakatable fruits
37 Mālik said, “If a man has four awsāq of dates he has harvested,

four awsāq of grapes he has picked, or four awsāq of wheat he has
reaped or four awsāq of pulses he has harvested, the diﬀerent
categories are not added together, and he does not have to pay zakāt
on any of the categories – the dates, the grapes, the wheat or the
pulses – until any one of them comes to ﬁve awsāq using the ṣā‘ of
the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬as the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘ere is no zakāt
(to pay) on anything less than ﬁve awsāq of dates.’
“If any of the categories comes to ﬁve awsāq, then zakāt must be
paid. If none of the categories comes to ﬁve awsāq, then there is no
zakāt to pay. e explanation of this is that when a man harvests ﬁve
212

awsāq of dates (from his palms), he adds them all together and
deducts the zakāt from them even if they are all of diﬀerent kinds
and varieties. It is the same with diﬀerent kinds of cereal, such as
brown wheat, white wheat, barley and sult, which are all considered
as one category. If a man reaps ﬁve awsāq of any of these, he adds it
all together and pays zakāt on it. If it does not come to that amount
he does not have to pay any zakāt. It is the same (also) with grapes,
whether they be black or red. If a man picks ﬁve awsāq of them he
has to pay zakāt on them, but if they do not come to that amount he
does not have to pay any zakāt. Pulses also are considered as one
category in the same way as cereals, dates and grapes, even if they
are of diﬀerent varieties and are called by diﬀerent names. Pulses
include chick-peas, lentils, beans, peas, and anything which is
agreed by everybody to be a pulse. If a man harvests ﬁve awsāq of
pulses, measuring by the aforementioned ṣā‘, the ṣā‘ of the Prophet
‫ﷺ‬, he collects them all together and must pay zakāt on them, even
if they are from all kinds of pulse and not just one kind.”
Mālik said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb drew a distinction between pulses
and wheat in what he took from the Nabatean Christians. He
considered all pulses to be one category and took a tenth from them,
and from cereals and raisins he took a twentieth.”
Mālik said, “If someone asks, ‘How can pulses be added up all
together when assessing the zakāt so that there is just one payment,
when a man can barter two of one kind for one of another, while
cereals cannot be bartered at a rate of two to one?’, then tell him,
‘Gold and silver are collected together when assessing the zakāt,
even though an amount of gold dinars can be exchanged hand to
hand for many times that amount of silver dirhams.’”
Mālik said regarding date-palms which are shared equally between
two men, and from which eight awsāq of dates are harvested, “ey
do not have to pay any zakāt on them. If one man owns ﬁve awsāq
of what is harvested from the one piece of land, and the other owns
four awsāq or less, the one who owns the ﬁve awsāq has to pay
213

zakāt, and the other one, who harvested four awsāq or less, does not
have to pay zakāt. is is how things are done whenever there are
associates in any crop, whether the crop is grain or seeds that are
reaped, or dates that are harvested, or grapes that are picked. Any
one of them that harvests ﬁve awsāq of dates, or picks ﬁve awsāq of
grapes, or reaps ﬁve awsāq of wheat, has to pay zakāt, and whoever’s
portion is less than ﬁve awsāq does not have to pay zakāt. Zakāt
only has to be paid by someone whose harvesting or picking or
reaping comes to ﬁve awsāq.”
Mālik said, “e sunna with us regarding anything from any of
these categories, i.e. wheat, dates, grapes and any kind of grain or
seed, which has had the zakāt deducted from it and is then stored by
its owner for a number of years after he has paid the zakāt on it until
he sells it, is that he does not have to pay any zakāt on the price he
sells it for until a year has elapsed over it from the day he made the
sale, as long as he got it through (chance) acquisition or some other
means and it was not intended for trading. Cereals, seeds and tradegoods are the same, in that if a man acquires some and keeps them
for a number of years and then sells them for gold or silver, he does
not have to pay zakāt on their price until a year has elapsed over it
from the day of sale. If, however, the goods were intended for trade
then the owner must pay zakāt on them when he sells them, as long
as he has had them for a year from the day when he paid zakāt on
the property with which he bought them.”

17.22 Non-zakatable fruits, animal fodder and vegetables
Mālik said, “e sunna that we are all agreed upon here (in Madīna)
and which I have heard from the people of knowledge, is that there
is no zakāt on any kind of fresh (soft) fruit, whether it be
pomegranates, peaches, ﬁgs or anything that is like them or not like
them as long as it is fruit.”
He continued, “No zakāt has to be paid on animal fodder or herbs
and vegetables of any kind, and there is no zakāt to pay on the price
214

realised on their sale until a year has elapsed over it from the day of
sale when the seller receives the sum, as long as it reaches the niṣāb.”

17.23 Zakāt on slaves, horses and honey
38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār from

Sulaymān ibn Yasār from ‘Irāk ibn Mālik from Abū Hurayra that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A Muslim does not have to pay any
zakāt on his slaves or his horses.”
39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sulaymān

ibn Yasār that the people of Syria said to Abū ‘Ubayda ibn al-Jarrāḥ,
“Take zakāt from our horses and slaves,” and he refused. en he
wrote to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and he (also) refused. Again they
talked to him and again he wrote to ‘Umar, and ‘Umar wrote back
to him saying, “If they want, take it from them and (then) give it
back to them and give their slaves provision.”
Mālik said, “What he means, may Allah have mercy upon him, by
the words ‘and give it back to them’ is ‘to their poor’.”
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

‘Amr ibn Ḥazm said, “A message came from ‘Umar ibn ʿAbd
al-‘Azīz to my father when he was in Minā telling him not to take
zakāt from either honey or horses.”
41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār said, “I

asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab about zakāt on work-horses, and he
said, ‘Is there any zakāt due on horses?’”

17.24 Jizya imposed on the People of the Book and Magians
42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “I have
heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬took jizya from the Magians

of Bahrain, that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb took it from the Magians of
Persia and that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān took it from the Berbers.”

215

43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad ibn

‘Alī from his father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb mentioned the
Magians and said, “I do not know what to do about them.” ʿAbd arRaḥmān ibn ‘Awf said, “I bear witness that I heard the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘Follow the same sunna with them as you follow with
the People of the Book.’”
44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Aslam, the

mawlā of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb, that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb imposed
a jizya tax of four dinars on those living where gold was the
currency, and forty dirhams on those living where silver was the
currency. In addition, they had to provide for the Muslims and
receive them as guests for three days.
45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from his

father that he said to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb, “ere is a blind shecamel behind the house,” so ‘Umar said, “Hand it over to a
household so that they can make (some) use of it.” He said, “But
she is blind.” ‘Umar replied, “en put it in a line with other
camels.” He said, “How will it be able to eat from the ground?”
‘Umar asked, “Is it from the livestock of the jizya or the zakāt?” and
Aslam replied, “From the livestock of the jizya.” ‘Umar said, “By
Allah, you wish to eat it.” Aslam said, “It has the brand of the jizya
on it.” So ‘Umar ordered it to be slaughtered. He had nine platters,
and on each of the platters he put some of every fruit and delicacy
that was available and then sent them to the wives of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬
and the one he sent to his daughter Ḥafṣa was the last of them all,
and if there was any deﬁciency in any of them it was in Ḥafṣa’s
portion.
“He put meat from the slaughtered animal on the platters and sent
them to the wives of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and he ordered what was left of
the meat of the slaughtered animal to be prepared. en he invited
the Muhājirūn and the Anṣār to eat it.”
Mālik said, “I do not think that livestock should be taken from
people who pay the jizya other than what is included in their jizya.”
216

46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

ʿAbd al-‘Azīz wrote to his governors telling them to relieve any
people who paid the jizya from paying the jizya if they became
Muslims.

Mālik said, “e past sunna is that there is no jizya due from
women or children of People of the Book, and that jizya is only
taken from men who have reached puberty. e people of dhimma
and the Magians do not have to pay any zakāt on their palms or
their vines or their crops or their livestock. is is because zakāt is
imposed on the Muslims to purify them and to be given back to
their poor, whereas jizya is imposed on the People of the Book to
humble them. As long as they are in the country they have agreed to
live in, they do not have to pay anything on their property except
the jizya. If, however, they trade in Muslim countries, coming and
going in them, a tenth is taken from what they invest in such trade.
is is because jizya is only imposed on them according to
conditions which they have agreed on, namely that they will remain
in their own countries, and that war will be waged for them on any
enemy of theirs, and that if they then leave that land to go anywhere
else to do business they will have to pay a tenth. Whoever among
them does business with the people of Egypt, and then goes to Syria
to do business with the people of Syria and then goes to Iraq to do
business with them and then goes on to Madīna, or Yemen, or other
similar places, has to pay a tenth.
“People of the Book and Magians do not have to pay any zakāt on
any of their property, livestock, produce or crops. at is still the
sunna. ey remain in the dīn they were in, and they continue to do
what they used to do. If in any one year they frequently come and
go in Muslim countries then they have to pay a tenth every time
they do so, since that is outside what they have agreed upon and not
one of the conditions stipulated for them. is is what I have seen
the people of knowledge of our city doing.”

17.25 e ‘ushr for the People of Dhimma
217

ʿ

47 Yaḥyā related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh

from his father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to take a twentieth
from the cereals and olive oil of the Nabatean Christians, intending
by that to increase the supply to Madīna. He would take a tenth
from pulses.
48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that as-Sā‘ib

ibn Yazīd said, “As a young man I used to work with ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd in the market of Madīna in the time of ‘Umar ibn
al-Khaṭṭāb and we used to take a tenth from the Nabateans.”
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had asked Ibn Shihāb

why ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to take a tenth from the Nabateans,
and Ibn Shihāb replied, “It used to be taken from them in the
Jāhiliyya, and ‘Umar imposed it on them.”

17.26 Selling ṣadaqa and taking it back
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that his father said

that he had heard ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb say, “I once gave someone a
noble horse to carry him in the way of Allah, and the man neglected
it. I wished to buy it back from him and I thought that he would
sell it cheaply. I asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about it and he
said, ‘Do not buy it, even if he gives it to you for one dirham, for
someone who takes back his ṣadaqa is like a dog swallowing its own
vomit.’”
51 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb gave a horse to carry someone in
the way of Allah, and then he wished to buy it back. So he asked the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about it, and he said, “Do not buy or take
back your ṣadaqa.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked about whether a man who gave
some ṣadaqa, and then found it being oﬀered back to him for sale by
someone other than the man to whom he had given it, could buy it
or not, and he said, “I would prefer that he leave it.”

17.27 Who pays the Zakāt al-Fiṭr
52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to pay the Zakāt al-Fiṭr for those slaves of his that were
at Wādī al-Qurā and Khaybar.

Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “e best that I have heard
about the Zakāt al-Fiṭr is that a man has to pay for every person that
he is responsible for supporting and whom he must support. He has
to pay for all his mukātab slaves, his mudabbar slaves, and his
ordinary slaves, whether they are present or absent, as long as they
are Muslim, and whether or not they are for trade. However, he
does not have to pay zakāt on any of them that are not Muslim.”
Mālik said, concerning a runaway slave, “I think that his master
should pay the zakāt for him, whether or not he knows where he is,
if it has not been long since the slave ran away and his master hopes
that he is still alive and will return. If it has been a long time since
he ran away and his master has despaired of him returning, then I
do not think that he should pay zakāt for him.”
Mālik said, “Zakāt al-Fiṭr has to be paid by people living in the
desert (i.e. nomadic people) just as it has to be paid by people living
in villages (i.e. settled people), because the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
made the Zakāt al-Fiṭr at the end of Ramaḍān obligatory on every
Muslim, whether freeman or slave, male or female.”

17.28 Measuring the Zakāt al-Fiṭr
53 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬made the zakāt of breaking

the fast at the end of Ramaḍān obligatory on every Muslim,
whether freeman or slave, male or female, and stipulated it as a ṣā‘
of dates or a ṣā‘ of barley.
54 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Iyāḍ

ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn Sa‘d ibn Abī Sarḥ al-‘Āmirī that he had heard
Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī say, “We used to pay the Zakāt al-Fiṭr with a
219

ṣā‘ of wheat, or a ṣā‘ of barley, or a ṣā‘ of dates, or a ṣā‘ of dried sour
milk, or a ṣā‘ of raisins, using the ṣā‘ of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬.”
55 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar would always pay the Zakāt al-Fiṭr in dates, except once,
when he paid it in barley.

Mālik said, “Payment of all types of kaﬀāra (expiation), of Zakāt alFiṭr and of the zakāt on grains for which a tenth or a twentieth is
due, is made using the smaller mudd, which is the mudd of the
Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬except in the case of ẓihār divorce, when the kaﬀāra is
paid using the mudd of Hishām, which is the larger mudd.”

17.29 When to send the Zakāt al-Fiṭr
56 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to send the Zakāt al-Fiṭr to the one with whom it was
collected together two or three days before the day of breaking the
fast.
57 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik had seen that the people of

knowledge used to like to pay the Zakāt al-Fiṭr after dawn had
broken on the day of the Fiṭr before they went to the place of prayer.

Mālik said, “ere is leeway in this, if Allah wills, in that it can be
paid either before setting out (for the prayer) on the day of Fiṭr or
afterwards.”

17.30 People who are not obliged to pay the Zakāt al-Fiṭr
58 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “A man does not have to pay

zakāt for the slaves of his slaves, or for someone employed by him,
or for his wife’s slaves, except for anyone who serves him and whose
services are indispensable to him, in which case he must pay zakāt.
He does not have to pay zakāt for any of his slaves that are
unbelievers and have not become Muslim, whether they be for trade
or otherwise.”
220

18. Fasting
18.1 Sighting the new moon for beginning and ending the fast of
Ramaḍān
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬once mentioned Ramaḍān

and said, “Do not begin the fast until you see the new moon, and do
not break the fast (at the end of Ramaḍān) until you see it. If the
new moon is obscured from you, then calculate (when it should
be).”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār from
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e

month has twenty-nine days in it. Do not start the fast or break it
until you see the new moon. If the new moon is obscured from you,
then calculate (when it should be).”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī
from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬once

mentioned Ramaḍān and said, “Do not start the fast or break it
until you see the new moon. If the new moon is obscured from you,
then complete a full thirty days.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that once in the

time of ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān the new moon was seen in the afternoon
but ‘Uthmān did not break his fast until evening had come and the
sun had set.
Yaḥyā said that he had heard Mālik say that someone who sees the
new moon of Ramaḍān when he is on his own should start the fast
and not break it if he knows that that day is part of Ramaḍān.

He added, “Someone who sees the new moon of Shawwāl when he
is on his own does not break the fast, because people suspect the
trustworthiness of someone among them who breaks the fast. Such
221

people should say when they sight the new moon, ‘We have seen the
new moon.’ Whoever sees the new moon of Shawwāl during the
day should not break his fast but should continue fasting for the rest
of that day. is is because it is really the new moon of the night
that is coming.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “If people are fasting on the Day
of Fiṭr thinking that it is still Ramaḍān and then deﬁnite evidence
comes to them that the new moon of Ramaḍān had been seen one
day before they began to fast and that they are now into the thirtyﬁrst day, then they should break the fast on that day at whatever
time the news comes to them. However, they do not pray the ‘Īd
prayer if they hear the news after the sun has begun to decline.”

18.2 Making the intention to fast before dawn
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Only someone who makes the intention to fast
before dawn (actually) fasts.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ‘Ā’isha and
Ḥafṣa, the wives of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬also said that.

18.3 Being quick to break the fast
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Ḥazm ibn Dīnār from
Sahl ibn Sa‘d as-Sā‘idī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “People

will continue to be all right as long as they hurry to break the fast.”

7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn

Ḥarmala al-Aslamī from Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “People will continue to be all right as long as they
hurry to break the fast.”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ḥumayd

ibn ʿAbd ar-Rahmān that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and ‘Uthmān ibn
‘Aﬀān would pray Maghrib when they saw the night darkening,
222

before they broke their fast, and then they would break their fast.
at was during Ramaḍān.

18.4 Fasting when someone ﬁnds himself in janāba in the
morning during Ramaḍān
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān ibn Ma‘mar al-Anṣārī from Abū Yūnus, the mawlā of
‘Ā’isha, from ‘Ā’isha that she overheard a man standing at the door
saying to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “Messenger of Allah, I get up
in the morning in janāba (in a state of major ritual impurity) and
want to fast,” and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I too get up in
the morning in janāba and want to fast, so I do ghusl and fast.” e
man said to him, “You are not the same as us. Allah has forgiven
you all your wrong actions that have gone before and those that have
come after.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬got angry and said, “By
Allah, I hope that I am the most fearful of you with respect to Allah
and the most knowledgeable of you in how to fear Allah.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd Rabbihi ibn Sa‘īd

from Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām
from ‘Ā’isha and Umm Salama, the wives of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the
Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬used to get up in the morning in janāba as a result of
intercourse, not a dream, in Ramaḍān, and then he would fast.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām that he heard
Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām say, “My
father and I were with Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam at the time when he
was governor of Madīna, and someone mentioned to him that Abū
Hurayra used to say, ‘If someone begins the morning in janāba, he
has broken the fast for that day.’ Marwān said, ‘I swear to you, ʿAbd
ar-Raḥmān, you must go to the two Umm al-Mu’minīn, ‘Ā’isha and
Umm Salama, and ask them about it.’
“ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān went to visit ‘Ā’isha and I accompanied him. He
greeted her and then said, ‘Umm al-Mu’minīn, we were with
223

Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam and someone mentioned to him that Abū
Hurayra used to say that if someone had begun the morning in
janāba, he had broken the fast for that day.’ ‘Ā’isha said, ‘It is not as
Abū Hurayra says, ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān. Do you dislike what the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to do?’ and ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān said, ‘No,
by Allah.’ ‘Ā’isha said, ‘I bear witness that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
used to get up in the morning in janāba from intercourse, not a
because of a dream, and would then fast for that day.’”
He continued, “en we went and visited Umm Salama, and ʿAbd
ar-Raḥmān asked her about the same matter and she said the same
as ‘Ā’isha had said. en we went oﬀ until we came to Marwān ibn
al-Ḥakam. ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān told him what they had both said and
Marwān said, ‘I swear to you, Abū Muḥammad, you must use the
mount which is at the door, and go to Abū Hurayra, who is on his
land at al-‘Aqīq, and tell him this.’ So ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān rode oﬀ,
and I went with him, until we came to Abū Hurayra. ʿAbd arRaḥmān talked with him for a while, and then mentioned the
matter to him, and Abū Hurayra said, ‘I don’t know anything about
it. I was just told that by someone.’”
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr, from Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that ‘Ā’isha and Umm
Salama, the wives of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬used to get up in the morning in janāba from intercourse, not on
account of a dream, and would then fast.”

18.5 Permission for a fasting man to kiss
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār that a certain man kissed his wife while he was fasting in
Ramaḍān. is made him very anxious, and so he sent his wife to
the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬to ask him about that for him. She went in and saw
Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, and mentioned the
matter to her, and Umm Salama told her that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to kiss while he was fasting. So she went back and
told her husband that, but it only made him ﬁnd fault all the more
224

and he said, “We are not like the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. Allah
makes permissible for the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬whatever He
wishes.”
His wife then went back to Umm Salama and found the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬with her. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “What is the
matter with this woman?” and Umm Salama told him. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Did you not tell her that I do that
myself?” and she said, “I told her, and she went to her husband and
told him, but it only made him ﬁnd fault all the more and say, ‘We
are not like the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. Allah makes permissible for
His Messenger ‫ ﷺ‬whatever He wishes.’” e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
got angry and said, “By Allah, I am the one with the most taqwā of
Allah of you all, and of you all the one who best knows His limits.”
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn j said, “e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to kiss certain of his wives when fasting,” and then
she laughed.
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Ātika

bint Zayd ibn ‘Amr ibn Nufayl, the wife of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb,
used to kiss ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb’s head while he was fasting, and
he did not forbid her.
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh that ‘Ā’isha bint Ṭalḥa told him that she was
once with ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, and her husband, who
was fasting, came and visited her there. (He was ʿAbdullāh ibn ʿAbd
ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq). ‘Ā’isha said to him, “What’s
stopping you from coming close to your wife and kissing her and
joking with her?” He asked, “Can I kiss her when I am fasting?” She
answered, “Yes.”
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that Abū

Hurayra and Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ used to say that someone who
was fasting was allowed to kiss.
225

18.6 Being strict about kissing when fasting
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Ā’isha,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, would say, when she mentioned that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to kiss while fasting, “And who among

you is more able to control himself than the Messenger of Allah
‫”?ﷺ‬
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said that Hishām ibn ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr
had said, “I do not think that kissing invites people who are fasting
to good.”
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās was asked about people kissing
while fasting and he said that he allowed it for old men but
disapproved of it for young men.
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to forbid kissing and fondling for people who were
fasting.

18.7 Fasting while travelling
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from
‘Ubaydullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd from ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Abbās that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬left for Makka in
Ramaḍān during the Year of the Conquest [of Makka], and fasted
until he reached al-Kadīd. He then broke the fast, and so everyone
else did so as well. What people used to do was act according to
whatever the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had done most recently.
21

22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān, from Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān
from one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered everyone to break the fast on the
journey he made in the Year of the Conquest saying, “Be strong for
your enemy,” while the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬kept on fasting. Abū
Bakr said that the one who related this to him said, “I saw the
226

Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬pouring water over his head at al-‘Arj, either
from thirst or from the heat. en someone said to the Messenger
of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, ‘Messenger of Allah, a group of people kept on fasting
when you did.’ en when the Messenger of Allah was at al-Kadīd,
he asked for a drinking-bowl and drank, and everyone broke the
fast.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd aṭ-Ṭawīl that

Anas ibn Mālik said, “We once travelled with the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in Ramaḍān, and those who were fasting did not ﬁnd fault
with those who were not, and those who were not fasting did not
ﬁnd fault with those who were.”
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that Ḥamza ibn ‘Amr al-Aslamī once said to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “Messenger of Allah, I am a man who fasts.
Can I fast when travelling?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬replied, “If
you want you can fast, and if you want you can break the fast.”
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used not to fast while travelling.

26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Hishām ibn ‘Urwa said,

“My father, ‘Urwa, used to travel in Ramaḍān and we would travel
with him, and he used to fast while we would break the fast and he
would not tell us to fast.”

18.8 Returning from a journey in Ramaḍān and intention to
travel in Ramaḍān
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb, if he was travelling in Ramaḍān and knew that he would
reach Madīna at the beginning of the day, would do so fasting.

Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “If someone is travelling and knows that
he will be reaching his people in the ﬁrst part of the day, and then
dawn breaks before he gets there, he should be fasting when he gets
there.”
227

Mālik said, “If someone intends to go away (on a journey) in
Ramaḍān, and then dawn breaks while he is still on his land before
he has left, he should fast that day.”
Mālik said that a man who returns from a journey in Ramaḍān and
is not fasting may have sexual intercourse with his wife if he wishes,
if she is not fasting and she has just become pure after her menses.

18.9 Kaﬀāra (making amends) for breaking the fast in Ramaḍān
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ḥumayd

ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf from Abū Hurayra that a man broke
the fast in Ramaḍān and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered him to
make kaﬀāra by freeing a slave, or fasting two consecutive months,
or feeding sixty poor people, and he said, “I cannot do it.” Someone
brought a large basket of dates to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he
said, “Take this and give it away as ṣadaqa.” He said, “Messenger of
Allah, there is no one more needy than I am.” e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬smiled until his molars showed and then said, “Eat them.”
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Aṭā’ ibn ʿAbdullāh al-

Khurasānī that Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said, “A bedouin came to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬beating his breast and tearing out his hair
and saying, ‘I am destroyed!’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Why
is that?’, and he said, ‘I had intercourse with my wife while fasting
in Ramaḍān.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked him, ‘Are you able
to free a slave?’ and the man said, ‘No.’ en he asked him, ‘Are you
able to give away a camel?’ and the man replied, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Sit
down.’ Someone brought a large basket of dates to the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he said to the man, ‘Take this and give it away as
ṣadaqa.’ e man said, ‘ere is no one more needy than me,’ and
(the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Eat them, and fast one day for the
day when you had intercourse.’”
Mālik said that ‘Aṭā’ said that he had asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab
how many dates there were in that basket, and he said, “Between
ﬁfteen and twenty ṣā‘s.”
228

Mālik said, “I have heard people of knowledge saying that the
kaﬀāra speciﬁed by the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬for a man who has
intercourse with his wife during the day in Ramaḍān is not due
from someone who, on a day when he is making up the fast of
Ramaḍān, breaks his fast by having intercourse with his wife, or
whatever. He only has to make up for that day.”
Mālik said, “is is what I like most out of what I have heard about
the matter.”

18.10 Cupping a man who is fasting
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to be cupped while he was fasting. Nāﬁ‘ said, “He later
stopped doing that, and would not be cupped when he was fasting
until he had broken the fast.”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘d ibn

Abī Waqqāṣ and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to be cupped while they
were fasting.

32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father used to be cupped while he was fasting and he would not
then break his fast. Hishām added, “I only ever saw him being
cupped when he was fasting.”
Mālik said, “Cupping is only disapproved of for someone who is
fasting out of fear that he will become weak and if it were not for
that it would not be disapproved of. I do not think that a man who
is cupped in Ramaḍān and does not break his fast owes anything,
and I do not say that he has to make up for the day on which he was
cupped, because cupping is only disapproved of for someone fasting
if his fast is endangered. I do not think that someone who is cupped,
and is then well enough to keep the fast until evening, owes
anything, nor does he have to make up for that day.”

18.11 Fasting the Day of ‘Āshūrā’ (the 10th of Muḥarram)
229

33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e Day of

‘Āshūrā’ was a day the Quraysh used to fast in the Jāhiliyya, and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, used also to fast it during the Jāhiliyya. en
when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came to Madīna he fasted it and
ordered that it be fasted. en Ramaḍān was made obligatory, and
that became the obligation instead of ‘Āshūrā’, but whoever wanted
to, fasted it, and whoever did not want to, did not fast it.”
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Ḥumayd

ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf heard Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān say
from the minbar on the Day of ‘Āshūrā’ in the year in which he
went on ḥajj, “People of Madīna, where are your learned men? I
heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say about this day, ‘is is the Day
of ‘Āshūrā’, and fasting it has not been prescribed for you. I am
fasting it, and whoever of you wants to fast it can do so, and
whoever does not want to does not have to.’”
35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb had sent (the following message) to al-Ḥārith ibn
Hishām, “Tomorrow is the Day of ‘Āshūrā’, so fast (it) and tell your
family to fast (also).”

18.12 Fasting the Days of Fiṭr and Aḍḥā and fasting continuously
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn

Ḥabbān from al-A‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade fasting on two days, the Day of Fiṭr and the Day of
Aḍḥā.
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he used to hear the people

of knowledge say, “ere is no harm in fasting continuously as long
as one breaks the fast on the days on which the Messenger of Allah,
‫ ﷺ‬forbade fasting, namely, the days of Minā, the Day of Aḍḥā and
the Day of Fiṭr, according to what we have heard.”

230

Mālik said, “is is what I like most out of what I have heard about
the matter.”

18.13 e prohibition against fasting for two days or more
without breaking the fast in between (wiṣāl)
38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullah ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade fasting for two days

or more without breaking the fast in between. ey said, “But
Messenger of Allah, you practice wiṣāl.” He replied, “I am not the
same as you. I am fed and given to drink.”

39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“Beware of wiṣāl. Beware of wiṣāl.” ey said, “But you practise
wiṣāl, Messenger of Allah.” He replied, “I am not the same as you.
My Lord feeds me and gives me to drink.”

18.14 Fasting on account of manslaughter or for pronouncing the
ẓihār form of divorce
40 Yaḥyā related to me, and I (myself ) heard Mālik say, “e best

that I have heard about someone who has to fast for two consecutive
months because of having killed someone by mistake, or having
pronounced the ẓihār form of divorce, becoming very ill and having
to break his fast is that, if he recovers from his illness and is strong
enough to fast, he must not delay doing so. He continues his fast
from where he left oﬀ.
“Similarly, a woman who has to fast because of having killed
someone by mistake should not delay resuming her fast when she
has become pure after her period. She continues her fast from where
she left oﬀ.
“No one who, by the Book of Allah, has to fast for two consecutive
months may break his fast except for reason of illness or
231

menstruation. He must not travel and break his fast.”
Mālik said, “is is the best that I have heard about the matter.”

18.15 Illness and the fast
41 Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What I have heard from the

people of knowledge is that, if a man succumbs to an illness which
makes fasting very diﬃcult for him and exhausts him and wears him
out, he can break his fast. is is the same as the case of a sick man
in the prayer who ﬁnds standing to be too diﬃcult and exhausting
(and Allah knows better than the slave that it is an excuse for him)
and other matters which are not described. If someone is in such a
condition he prays sitting, and the dīn of Allah is ease.
“Allah has permitted a traveller to break the fast when travelling,
and he has more strength for fasting than a sick man. Allah, the
Exalted, says in His says in His Book, ‘But any of you who are ill or
on a journey should fast a number of other days,’ (2:185) and Allah
has thus permitted a traveller to break his fast when on a journey,
and he is more capable of fasting than a sick man.”
“is is what I most prefer of what I had heard, and it is the practice
on which there is consensus among us.”

18.16 e vow to fast, and fasting on behalf of a dead person
42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab was asked whether a man who had vowed to fast a
month could fast voluntarily, and Sa‘īd said, “He should fulﬁl his
vow before he does any voluntary fasting.”
Mālik said, “I have heard the same thing from Sulaymān ibn Yasār.”
Mālik said, “If someone dies with an unfulﬁlled vow to free a slave
or to fast or to give ṣadaqa or to give away a camel, and makes a
232

bequest that his vow should be fulﬁlled from his estate, then the
ṣadaqa or the gift of the camel is taken from one third of his estate.
Preference is given to it over other bequests, except things of a
similar nature, because by his vow it has become incumbent on him,
and this is not the case with something he donates voluntarily. ey
(vows and voluntary donations) are settled from one-third of his
estate, and not from the whole of it, since if the dying man were
free to dispose of all of his estate, he might delay settling what had
become incumbent on him (i.e. his vows), so that when death came
and the estate passed into the hands of his heirs, he would have
bequeathed such things (i.e. his vows) that were not claimed by
anyone (like debts). If that (i.e. to dispose freely of his property)
were allowed him, he would delay these things (i.e. his vows) until
when he was near death, he would designate them and they might
take up all of his estate. He must not do that.”
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar used to be asked, “Can someone fast for someone else, or
do the prayer for someone else?” and he would reply, “No one can
fast or do the prayer for anyone else.”

18.17 Making up days missed in Ramaḍān, and the kaﬀāra
44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from his

brother Khālid ibn Aslam that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb once broke the
fast on a cloudy day thinking that evening had come and the sun
had set. en a man came to him and said, “Amīr al-Mu’minīn, the
sun has come out,” and ‘Umar said, “at is an easy matter. It was
our deduction (ijtihād).”
Mālik commented, “According to what we think, Allah knows best,
what he was referring to when he said, ‘at is an easy matter’ was
making up the fast, and how slight the eﬀort involved was and how
easy it was. He was saying (in eﬀect), ‘We will fast another day in its
place.’”

233

ʿ

45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Someone who breaks the fast in Ramaḍān
because he is ill or travelling should make up the days he has missed
consecutively.”
46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ʿAbdullah

ibn ‘Abbās and Abū Hurayra diﬀered about making up days missed
in Ramaḍān. One of them said that they were done separately and
the other said that they were done consecutively. He did not know
which one of them it was who said that they were done separately.
47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “If someone makes himself vomit while he is
fasting he has to make up a day, but if he cannot help vomiting he
does not have to make up anything.”
48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab being asked about making up days
missed in Ramaḍān, and Sa‘īd said, “What I like best is for days
missed in Ramaḍān to be made up consecutively and not separately.”
Yaḥyā said that he had heard Mālik say, about someone who made
up the days he had missed in Ramaḍān separately that he did not
have to repeat them. (What he had done) was enough for him. It
was, however, preferable to do them consecutively.
Mālik said, “Whoever eats or drinks thoughtlessly or forgetfully in
Ramaḍān, or during any other obligatory fast that he must do, has
to fast another day in its place.”
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ḥumayd ibn Qays al-Makkī

told him, “I was with Mujāhid while he was performing ṭawāf
around the Ka‘ba, and a man came to him and asked whether the
days (of fasting) for kaﬀāra (making amends) had to be fasted
consecutively, or whether they could be split up. I said to him, ‘Yes,
they can be split up, if the person so wishes.’ Mujāhid said, ‘He

234

should not split them up, because in Ubayy ibn Ka‘b’s recitation they
are referred to as three consecutive days.”
Mālik said, “What I like most is what Allah has speciﬁed in the
Qur’ān, that is that they are fasted consecutively.”
Mālik was asked about a woman who began the day fasting in
Ramaḍān and, though it was outside of the time of her period, fresh
blood (i.e. not menstrual blood) ﬂowed from her. She then waited
until evening to see the same, but did not see anything. en, on the
next day in the morning she had another ﬂow, though less than the
ﬁrst. en, some days before her period, the ﬂow stopped
completely. Mālik was asked what she should do about her fasting
and prayer, and he said, “is blood is like menstrual blood. When
she sees it she should break her fast, and then make up the days she
has missed. en, when the blood has completely stopped, she
should have a ghusl and fast.”
Mālik was asked whether someone who became Muslim on the last
day of Ramaḍān had to make up all of Ramaḍān or whether he just
had to make up the day when he became Muslim, and he said, “He
does not have to make up any of the days that have passed. He
begins fasting from that day onwards. What I like most is that he
makes up the day on which he became Muslim.”

18.18 Making up voluntary fasts
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ‘Ā’isha and
Ḥafṣa, the wives of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬began fasting voluntarily one

morning and then food was given to them and they broke their fast
with it. en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came in. ‘Ā’isha said,
“Ḥafṣa asked, anticipating me in speech – she took after her father
‘Umar – ‘Messenger of Allah, ‘Ā’isha and I began the morning
fasting voluntarily and then food was given us and we broke the fast
with it.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Fast another day in its
place.’”

235

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “Someone who eats or drinks
out of absent-mindedness or forgetfulness during a voluntary fast
does not have to repeat his fast, but he should continue fasting for
the rest of any day, in which he eats or drinks while fasting
voluntarily, and not stop fasting. Someone to whom something
unexpected happens, which causes him to break his fast while he is
fasting voluntarily, does not have to repeat his fast if he has broken
it for a reason and not simply because he decided to break his fast,
just as I do not think that someone has to repeat a voluntary prayer
if he has had to stop it because of some discharge which he could
not prevent and which meant that he had to repeat his wuḍū’.”
Mālik said, “Once a man has begun doing any of the right actions
such as the prayer, the fast and the ḥajj, or similar right actions of a
voluntary nature, he should not stop until he has completed it,
according to what the sunna for that action is. If he says the takbīr
he should not stop until he has prayed two rak‘as. If he is fasting he
should not break his fast until he has completed that day’s fast. If he
goes into iḥrām he should not return until he has completed his ḥajj,
and if he begins doing ṭawāf he should not stop doing so until he
has gone around the Ka‘ba seven times. He should not stop doing
any of these actions once he has started them until he has completed
them, except if something happens such as illness or some other
matter by which a man is excused. is is because Allah, the Blessed
and Exalted, says in His Book, ‘Eat and drink until you can clearly
discern the white thread from the black thread of the dawn. en
complete the fast until the night appears’ (2:187), and so he must
complete his fast as Allah has said. Allah, the Exalted, (also) says,
‘Perform the ḥajj and ‘umra for Allah,’ (2:196) and so if a man were
to go into iḥrām for a voluntary ḥajj, having performed his one
obligatory ḥajj (on a previous occasion), he could not then stop
doing his ḥajj having once begun it and come out of iḥrām while in
the middle of his ḥajj. Anyone that begins a voluntary act must
complete it once he has begun doing it, just as an obligatory act
must be completed. is is the best of what I have heard.”

18.19 e ﬁdya (compensation) for breaking the fast in Ramaḍān
for a reason
51 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Anas ibn

Mālik used to pay ﬁdya when he had grown old and was no longer
able to fast.
Mālik said, “I do not consider that to do so is obligatory, but what I
like most is that a man does the fast when he is strong enough.
Whoever pays compensation gives one mudd of food in place of
every day, using the mudd of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬.”
52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar was asked about what a pregnant woman should do if the
fast became diﬃcult for her and she feared for her child, and he
said, “She should break the fast and feed a poor man one mudd of
wheat in place of every day missed, using the mudd of the Prophet
‫ﷺ‬.”

Mālik said, “e people of knowledge consider that she has to make
up for each day of the fast that she misses as Allah, the Exalted and
Gloriﬁed, says, ‘But any of you who are ill or on a journey should
fast a number of other days,’ (2:185) and they consider this
pregnancy as a sickness, in addition to her fear for her child.”
53 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim that his father used to say, “If someone has to make up for
days not fasted in Ramaḍān and does not do them before the next
Ramaḍān comes although he is strong enough to do so, he should
feed a poor man with a mudd of wheat for every day that he has
missed, and he has to fast the days he owes as well.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard the same thing
from Sa‘īd ibn Jubayr.

18.20 Making up days of Ramaḍān in general

237

54 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Abū

Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that he heard ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, say, “I used to have to make up days from Ramaḍān and
not be able to do them until Sha‘bān came.”

18.21 Fasting the “Day of Doubt”
55 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard the people of

knowledge telling people not to fast on the day in Sha‘bān when
there was doubt (about whether it was Sha‘bān or Ramaḍān), if they
intended by it the fast of Ramaḍān. ey considered that whoever
fasted on that day without having seen (the new moon) had to make
up that day if it later became clear that it really was part of
Ramaḍān. ey did not see any harm in voluntary fasting on that
day.
Mālik said, “is is what we do, and what I have seen the people of
knowledge in our city doing.”

18.22 e Fast in General
56 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Rahmān that
‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
used to fast for so long that we thought he would never stop fasting,
and he would go without fasting for so long that we thought he
would never fast again. I never saw the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬fast
for a complete month except for Ramaḍān, and I never saw him fast
more in any one month than he did in Sha‘bān.”
57 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“Fasting is a protection for you, so when you are fasting, do not
behave obscenely or foolishly, and if anyone argues with you or
abuses you, say, ‘I am fasting, I am fasting.’”

58 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “By

238

the One in Whose hand my self is, the smell of the breath of a man
fasting is better with Allah than the scent of musk. Allah says, ‘He
leaves his desires and his food and drink for My sake. Fasting is for
Me and I reward it. Every good action is rewarded by ten times its
kind, up to seven hundred times, except fasting, which is for Me,
and I reward it.’”
59 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from his paternal uncle Abū

Suhayl ibn Mālik from his father that Abū Hurayra said, “When
Ramaḍān comes the gates of the Garden are opened and the gates
of the Fire are locked, and the shayṭāns are chained.”

60 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the

people of knowledge did not disapprove of fasting people using
tooth-sticks at any hour of the day in Ramaḍān, whether at the
beginning or the end, nor had he heard any of the people of
knowledge disapproving of or forbidding the practice.

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, about fasting for six days after
breaking the fast at the end of Ramaḍān, that he had never seen any
of the people of knowledge and ﬁqh fasting them. He said, “I have
not heard that any of our predecessors used to do that, and the
people of knowledge disapprove of it and they are afraid that it
might become an innovation and that common and ignorant people
might join to Ramaḍān what does not belong to it, if they were to
think that the people of knowledge had given permission for that to
be done and were seen doing it.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “I have never heard any of the
people of knowledge and ﬁqh and those whom people take as an
example forbidding fasting on the day of jumu‘a (Friday). Fasting on
it is good, and I have seen one of the people of knowledge fasting it,
and it seemed to me that he was keen to do so.”

239

19. I‘tikāf in Ramaḍān
19.1 Concerning i‘tikāf (retreat)
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr from ‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that ‘Ā’isha, the wife
of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “When the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did
i‘tikāf he would bring his head near to me and I would comb it. He
would only go into the house to relieve himself.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Amra bint

ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that when ‘Ā’isha was doing i‘tikāf she would only
ask after sick people if she was walking but not if she was standing
still.

Mālik said, “A person doing i‘tikāf should not carry out his worldly
obligations nor leave the mosque for them, nor should he help
anyone. He should only leave the mosque to relieve himself. If he
were able to go out to do things for people, then visiting the sick,
praying over the dead and following funeral processions would be
the things with the most claim on his going out.”
Mālik said, “A person doing i‘tikāf is not doing i‘tikāf until he avoids
what someone doing i‘tikāf should avoid, namely, visiting the sick,
praying over the dead, and going into houses, except to relieve
himself.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had asked Ibn Shihāb

whether someone doing i‘tikāf could go into a house to relieve
himself, and he said, “Yes, there is no harm in that.”
Mālik said, “e situation that we are all agreed upon here (in
Madīna) is that there is no disapproval of anyone doing i‘tikāf in a
mosque where jumu‘a is held. e only reason I see for disapproving
of doing i‘tikāf in a mosque where jumu‘a is not held is that the man
doing i‘tikāf would have to leave the mosque where he was doing
240

i‘tikāf in order to go to jumu‘a, or else not go to it at all. If, however,
he is doing i‘tikāf in a mosque where jumu‘a is not held, and he does
not have to go to jumu‘a in any other mosque, then I see no harm in
him doing i‘tikāf there, because Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,
says, ‘While you are doing i‘tikāf in mosques,’ (2:187) and refers to
all mosques in general, without specifying any particular kind.”
Mālik continued, “Accordingly, it is permissible for a man to do
i‘tikāf in a mosque where jumu‘a is not held if he does not have to
leave it to go to a mosque where jumu‘a is held.”
Mālik said, “A person doing i‘tikāf should not spend the night
anywhere except in the mosque where he is doing i‘tikāf, unless his
tent is in one of the courtyards of the mosque. I have never heard
that someone doing i‘tikāf can put up a shelter anywhere except in
the mosque itself or in one of the courtyards of the mosque.
”Part of what shows that the person doing i‘tikāf must spend the
night in the mosque is ‘Ā’isha saying that when the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬, was doing i‘tikāf, he would only go into the house to
relieve himself. Nor should someone do i‘tikāf on the roof of the
mosque or in the minaret.”
Mālik said, “e person who is going to do i‘tikāf should enter the
place where he wishes to do i‘tikāf before the sun sets on the night
when he wishes to begin his i‘tikāf, so that he is ready to begin the
i‘tikāf at the beginning of the night when he is going to start his
i‘tikāf. A person doing i‘tikāf should be occupied with his i‘tikāf, and
not turn his attention to other things which might occupy him, such
as trading or whatever. ere is no harm, however, if someone doing
i‘tikāf tells someone to do something for him regarding his estate, or
the aﬀairs of his family, or tells someone to sell some property of his,
or something else that does not occupy him directly. ere is no
harm in him arranging for someone else to do that for him if it is a
simple matter.”

241

Mālik said, “I have never heard any of the people of knowledge
mentioning any modiﬁcation as far as how to do i‘tikāf is concerned.
I‘tikāf is an act of worship like the prayer, fasting, the Ḥajj, and
similar acts, whether they are obligatory or voluntary. Anyone who
begins doing any of these acts should do them according to what has
come down in the Sunna. He should not start doing anything in
them that the Muslims have not done, whether it is a modiﬁcation
that he imposes on others, or one that he begins doing himself. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬practised i‘tikāf, and the Muslims know what
the sunna of i‘tikāf is.”
Mālik said, “I‘tikāf and jiwār mean the same, and i‘tikāf is the same
for the village-dweller as it is for the nomad.”

19.2 Essentials of i‘tikāf
YA 4 ḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that al-Qāsim
ibn Muḥammad and Nāﬁ‘, the mawlā of ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said,
“You cannot do i‘tikāf unless you are fasting, because of what Allah,
the Blessed and Exalted, says in His Book, ‘And eat and drink until
the white thread becomes clear to you from the black thread of
dawn, then complete the fast until night-time, but do not have
intercourse with them while you are doing i‘tikāf in mosques.’
(2:187) Allah only mentions i‘tikāf together with fasting.”
Mālik said, “at is the practice with us in Madīna. I‘tikāf must be
done while fasting.”

19.3 Leaving i‘tikāf for the ‘Īd
5 Yaḥyā related to me that Ziyād ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān said, “Mālik

related to us from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd arRaḥmān, that Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān was once doing i‘tikāf
and he would go out to relieve himself in a closed room under a
roofed passage in Khālid ibn Walīd’s house. Otherwise he did not
leave his place of i‘tikāf until he went to pray the ‘Īd with the
Muslims.”
242

6 Yaḥyā related to me from Ziyād from Mālik that he saw some of

the people of knowledge who, when they did i‘tikāf in the last ten
days of Ramaḍān, would not go back to their families until they had
attended the ‘Īd al-Fiṭr with the people.
Ziyād said that Mālik said, “I heard this from the people of
excellence who have passed away, and it is what I like most out of
what I have heard about the matter.”

19.4 Making up for the i‘tikāf (not done)
7 Ziyād related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Amra bint
ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān from ‘Ā’isha that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

wanted to do i‘tikāf, and, when he went oﬀ to the place where he
wanted to do i‘tikāf, he found some tents there, which were ‘Ā’isha’s
tent, Ḥafsa’s tent, and Zaynab’s tent. When he saw them he asked
about them and someone told him that they were the tents of
‘Ā’isha, Ḥafsa and Zaynab. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do you
say they intended piety by them?” en he left, and did not do
i‘tikāf until Shawwāl, when he then did it for ten days.
Mālik was asked whether someone who went into a mosque to do
i‘tikāf for the last ten days of Ramaḍān and stayed there for a day or
two but then became ill and left the mosque had to do i‘tikāf for the
number of days that were left from the ten or not, and if he did have
to do so, then what month should he do it in, and he replied, “He
should make up whatever he has to do of the i‘tikāf when he
recovers, whether in Ramaḍān or otherwise. I have heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬once wanted to do i‘tikāf in Ramaḍān, but
then came back without having done so, and then when Ramaḍān
had gone, he did i‘tikāf for ten days in Shawwāl.
“Someone who does i‘tikāf voluntarily in Ramaḍān and someone
who has to do i‘tikāf are in the same position regarding what is
lawful for them and what is unlawful. I have not heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ever did i‘tikāf other than voluntarily.”

243

Mālik said that if a woman went into i‘tikāf and then menstruated
during her i‘tikāf, she should return to her house and, when she was
pure again, then she should return to the mosque at whatever time it
was that she became pure. She should then continue her i‘tikāf from
where she left oﬀ. is ruling is the same for a woman who had to
fast two consecutive months, who then menstruates and then
becomes pure: she too continues the fast from where she had to stop
and does not delay doing so.
8 Ziyād related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to go to relieve himself in houses.

the

Mālik said, “Someone doing i‘tikāf should not leave for his parents’
funeral or for anything else.”

19.5 Marriage in i‘tikāf
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in someone who is in i‘tikāf entering
into a marriage contract as long as there is no physical relationship.
A woman in i‘tikāf may also be betrothed as long as there is no
physical relationship. What is forbidden for someone in i‘tikāf, in
relation to his womenfolk during the day, is also forbidden for him
during the night.”
Yaḥyā said that Ziyād said that Mālik said, “It is not lawful for a
man to have intercourse with his wife while he is in i‘tikāf, nor for
him to take pleasure in her by kissing her, or whatever. However, I
have not heard anyone disapproving of a man or woman in i‘tikāf
getting married as long as there is no physical relationship. Marriage
is not disapproved of for someone fasting. ere is, however, a
distinction between the marriage of someone in i‘tikāf and that of
someone who is muḥrim, in that someone who is in iḥrām can eat,
drink, visit the sick and attend funerals, but cannot put on perfume,
whilst a man or woman in i‘tikāf can put on oil and perfume and
groom their hair, but cannot attend funerals or pray over the dead or
visit the sick. us their situations with regard to marriage are

244

diﬀerent. is is the sunna as it has come down to us regarding
marriage for those who are in iḥrām, doing i‘tikāf, or fasting.”

19.6 Laylat al-Qadr (e Night of Power)
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn al-

Hādi from Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm al-Hārith at-Taymi from Abū
Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to do i‘tikāf in the middle ten days of
Ramaḍān. One year he was doing i‘tikāf and then, when it came to
the night of the twenty-ﬁrst, which was the night before the
morning when he would normally have ﬁnished his i‘tikāf, he said,
‘ose who have done i‘tikāf with me should continue doing i‘tikāf
for the last ten days. I was shown this night in a dream and then I
was made to forget it. I saw myself prostrating the following
morning in water and mud. Look for it during the last ten days, and
look for it on the odd nights.”
Abū Sa‘īd continued, “e sky poured with rain that night and the
mosque, which had a roof (made of palm-fronds), was soaked. With
my own eyes I saw the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬leave with traces of
water and mud on his forehead and nose, in the morning after the
night of the twenty-ﬁrst.”
10 Ziyād related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Search for Laylat al-

Qadr in the last ten days of Ramaḍān.”

11 Ziyād related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnar from
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Search

for Laylat al-Qadr in the last seven days.”

12 Ziyād related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā

of ‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, that ʿAbdullāh ibn Unays al-Juhanī said
to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “Messenger of Allah, I am a man
whose house is a long way oﬀ. Tell me one night so that I can stop

245

my journey for it.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Stop on the
twenty-third night of Ramaḍān.”
13 Ziyād related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd aṭ-Ṭawīl that
Anas ibn Mālik said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came out to us in

Ramaḍān and said, ‘I was shown a certain night in Ramaḍān and
then two men quarrelled and it was taken away. Look for it on the
twenty-seventh, twenty-ninth and twenty-ﬁfth.’”
14 Ziyād related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Ibn ‘Umar that
some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬were shown

in a dream that the Laylat al-Qadr is during the last seven days. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I think that your dreams agree about
the last seven nights. ose who want to look for it, should look for
it in the last seven nights.”
15 Ziyād related to me from Mālik that he had heard a man he
trusted of the people of knowledge say, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

was shown the life-spans of the people (who had gone) before him,
or what Allah willed of that, and it was as if the lives of the people
of his community had become too short for them to be able to do as
many good actions as others before them had been able to do with
their long lives, so Allah gave him Laylat al-Qadr, which is better
than a thousand months.”
16 Ziyād related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab used to say, “Whoever is present at ‘Ishā’ on Laylat alQadr has taken his portion from it.”

246

20. Ḥajj
20.1 e ghusl of iḥrām
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim from his father from Asmā’ bint ‘Umays that she gave birth
to Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr at al-Bayḍā’. Abū Bakr mentioned this
to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he said, “Tell her to do ghusl and
then enter iḥrām.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab that Asmā’ bint ‘Umays gave birth to Muḥammad
ibn Abī Bakr at Dhū al-Ḥulayfa and Abū Bakr told her to do ghusl
and then enter iḥrām.
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to do ghusl for iḥrām before he entered iḥrām, and for
entering Makka, and for standing on the afternoon of ‘Arafa.

20.2 Ghusl in iḥrām
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from

Ibrāhīm ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn Ḥunayn from his father ʿAbdullāh ibn
Ḥunayn that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās and al-Miswar ibn Makhrama
once had a disagreement at al-Abwā’. ʿAbdullah said that someone
in iḥrām could wash his head, and al-Miswar ibn Makhrama
maintained that someone in iḥrām could not wash his head.

ʿAbdullāh ibn Ḥunayn continued, “ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās sent me to
Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī, and I found him doing ghusl between the
posts of a well, screened by a garment. I greeted him and he said,
‘Who is that?’ I replied, ‘I am ʿAbdullāh ibn Ḥunayn. ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Abbās sent me to you to ask how the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, used
to wash his head when he was in iḥrām.’”

247

He continued, “Abū Ayyūb put his hand on the garment and pulled
it down until I could see his head. He said to the man who was
pouring out the water for him, ‘Pour,’ and he poured some over his
head. en he passed his hands over his head from the front to the
back and then to the front again, and then said, ‘I saw the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬doing it like this.’”
5 Mālik related to me from Ḥumayd ibn Qays from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Abī

Rabāḥ that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb once asked Ya‘lā ibn Munya, who
was pouring out water for him while he was having a ghusl, to pour
some on his head. Ya‘lā said, “Are you trying to make me
responsible? I will only pour it out if you tell me to do so.” ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Pour: it will only make (my head) more
unkempt.”
6 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar would

spend the night between the two trails in the valley of Dhū Ṭuwā
when he was approaching Makka. en he would pray Ṣubḥ, and
after that he would enter Makka by the trail which is at the highest
part of Makka. He would never enter Makka if he was coming for
ḥajj or ‘umra without doing ghusl beforehand when he was near
Makka at Dhū Ṭuwā, and he would tell whoever was with him to do
likewise.

7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar would never wash his head while he was in iḥrām unless if he
had to do ghusl because of a wet dream.

Mālik said, “I have heard the people of knowledge say that there is
no harm in someone who is in iḥrām rubbing his head with certain
kinds of plants after he has stoned the Jamrat al-‘Aqaba but before
he has shaved his head, because once he has ﬁnished stoning the
Jamrat al-‘Aqaba it is ḥalāl for him to kill lice, to shave his head, to
clean himself of body hair, and to wear normal clothes.”

20.3 Clothes forbidden in iḥrām

248

ʿ

8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that a man once asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬what

clothes someone in iḥrām could wear, and the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do not wear shirts, turbans, trousers, burnouses, or leather
socks except if you cannot ﬁnd sandals. In that case you can wear
leather socks, but cut them oﬀ below the ankles. Do not wear any
clothes that have been touched by saﬀron or yellow dye (wars).”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked about the ḥadīth attributed to the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, “Whoever cannot ﬁnd a waist-wrapper should wear
trousers,” and he said, “I have never heard this, and I do not think
that someone who is in iḥrām can wear trousers, because among the
things which the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬forbade someone in iḥrām to wear were
trousers, and he did not make any exception for them although he
did make an exception for leather socks.”

20.4 Clothes worn in iḥrām
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār that
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade

anyone in iḥrām to wear a garment which had been dyed with
saﬀron or yellow dye (wars), and said, ‘Anyone that cannot ﬁnd
sandals can wear leather socks, but he should cut them oﬀ below the
ankles.’”

10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that he had heard

Aslam, the mawlā of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, telling ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb once saw a dyed garment on Ṭalḥa
ibn ‘Ubaydullāh while he was in iḥrām and ‘Umar said, “What is
this dyed garment, Talḥa?” and Ṭalha said, “Amīr al-Mu’minīn, it is
only mud.” ‘Umar said, “You and your like are taken by people as
imāms, and if an ignorant man were to see this garment he would
say that Ṭalha ibn ‘Ubaydullāh used to wear a dyed robe while he
was in iḥrām. So do not wear any form of dyed clothes.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that Asmā’ bint Abī Bakr had worn clothes that were
249

completely dyed with saﬄower while she was in iḥrām – there was
not any saﬀron on them, though.
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked if a garment which had been
perfumed could be used for iḥrām if the smell of the perfume had
gone, and he said, “Yes, as long as there is no saﬀron or yellow dye
(wars) on it.”

20.5 Wearing a belt in iḥrām
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to disapprove of anybody wearing a belt or girdle while
in iḥrām.

. 131 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he
heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, about the girdle worn by some one
in iḥrām under his clothes, “ere is no harm in it if he ties the ends
together as a belt.”
Mālik said, “is is what I like most out of what I have heard about
the matter.”

20.6 Veiling the face in iḥrām
13.23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad said that al-Furāﬁṣa ibn ‘Umayr al-Ḥanafī
saw ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān at al-‘Arj, and he was covering his face
while in iḥrām.
3 e Arabic Edition repeats the numbering on these ḥadīths.
13.33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say that a man in iḥrām should not veil anything
above his chin.
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar shrouded his son Wāqid ibn ʿAbdullāh, who had died at al-

250

Juḥfa while in iḥrām, and he veiled his head and face and said, “If
we had not been in iḥrām we ourselves would have perfumed him.”
Mālik commented, “A man can only do things while he is alive.
When he is dead, his actions stop.”
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say that a woman in iḥrām should wear neither a veil
nor gloves.
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

Fāṭima bint al-Mundhir said, “We used to veil our faces when we
were in iḥrām in the company of Asmā’ bint Abī Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddiq.”

20.7 Wearing perfume during ḥajj
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn alQāsim from his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said,
“I perfumed the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬for his iḥrām before he

entered iḥrām, and when he came out of iḥrām before he did ṭawāf
of the House.”
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd ibn Qays from
‘Aṭā’ ibn Rabāḥ that a bedouin came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

when he was at Ḥunayn, and he was wearing a shirt with traces of
yellow on it. He said, “Messenger of Allah, I have entered iḥrām for
‘umra. What should I do?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told him,
“Take oﬀ your shirt and wash oﬀ this yellowness and do in ‘umra as
you would do on ḥajj.”
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Aslam, the

mawlā of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb noticed
the smell of perfume while he was at ash-Shajara and asked, “Who
is this smell of perfume coming from?” Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān
answered, “From me, Amīr al-Mu’minīn.” ‘Umar said, “From you?
By the life of Allah!” Mu‘āwiya explained, “Umm Habība perfumed
me, Amīr al-Mu’minīn.” ‘Umar then said, “You must go back and
wash it oﬀ.”
251

20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from aṣ-Ṣalt ibn Zubayd from

more than one of his family that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb noticed the
smell of perfume while he was at ash-Shajara. Kathīr ibn aṣ-Ṣalt
was at his side, and ‘Umar asked, “Who is this smell of perfume
coming from?” and Kathīr answered, “From me, Amīr al-Mu’minīn.
I matted my hair with perfume and I intended not to shave it.”
‘Umar said, “Go to a sharaba and rub your head until it is clean,”
and Kathīr did so.
Mālik explained, “A sharaba is the ditch at the base of a date-palm.”
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd and

ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr and Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that
al-Walīd ibn ʿAbd al-Mālik asked Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh and Khārija
ibn Zayd ibn ābit if he could use perfume after he had stoned the
jamra and shaved his head but before he had left for the Ṭawāf alIfāḍa. Sālim forbade him to do so, but Khārija ibn Zayd ibn ābit
said that he could.

Mālik said, “ere is no harm in a man oiling himself with an oil
which does not have any perfume in it, either before he enters
iḥrām, or before he leaves Mina for the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa, if he has
stoned the jamra.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether someone in iḥrām could
eat food with saﬀron in it, and he said, “ere is no harm in
someone in iḥrām eating it if it has been cooked. If, however, it has
not been cooked he should not eat it.”

20.8 Points of entry for iḥrām (mawāqīt)
22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e people of Madīna

should enter iḥrām at Dhū al-Ḥulayfa, the people of Syria should do
so at al-Juḥfa, and the people of Najd should do so at Qarn.”

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar added, “I have heard that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘e people of Yemen should enter iḥrām at
252

Yalamlam.’”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār that
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told the

people of Madīna to enter iḥrām at Dhū al-Ḥulayfa, the people of
Syria to do so at al-Juḥfa, and the people of Najd to do so at Qarn.”
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “I heard these three from the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. I was also told that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘e people of Yemen should enter iḥrām at Yalamlam.’”
24

25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar once entered iḥrām at al-Fur‘.

26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from a reliable source that

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar once entered iḥrām at Ilyā’ ( Jerusalem).

27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬once entered iḥrām at al-Ji‘irrāna (near

Makka) for an ‘umra.

20.9 e method of entering iḥrām
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that
the talbiya of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was, “I am at Your service,

O Allah, I am at Your service. I am at Your service, You have no
partner. I am at Your service. Praise and blessing belong to You, and
the Kingdom. You have no partner.”

Labbayk Allāhumma labbayk. Labbayka lā sharīka laka labbayk.
Inna’l-ḥamda wa’n-ni‘mata laka wa’l-mulk. Lā sharīka lak.
Mālik said that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to add, “I am at Your
service, I am at Your service. I am at Your service and at Your call.
Good is in Your hands, and I am at Your service. Our desire is for
You, and our action.”

253

Labbayka labbayka labbayka wa sa‘dayk. Wa’l-khayru bi yadayka
labbayk. Wa’r-raghbā’u ilayka wa’l-‘amal.
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to pray two rak‘as in

the mosque at Dhū al-Ḥulayfa, and then, when he had got on to his
camel and it had stood up, he would begin doing talbiya.

30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Musā ibn ‘Uqba that Sālim

ibn ʿAbdullāh heard his father say, “Your claim that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬began doing talbiya from this desert of yours is not true,
because he only began doing talbiya from the mosque, i.e. the
mosque of Dhū al-Ḥulayfa.”

“Your claim that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬began doing talbiya
from this desert of yours is not true.” i.e. you say that he assumed
iḥrām from there when he did not, in fact, do so.
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sa‘īd ibn Abī Sa‘īd al-

Maqburī that ‘Ubayd ibn Jurayj once said to ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar,
“Abū ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān, I have seen you doing four things which I
have never seen any of your companions doing.” He said, “What are
they, Ibn Jurayj?” and he replied, “I have seen you touching only the
two Yamānī corners, I have seen you wearing hairless sandals, I have
seen you using yellow dye, and, when you were at Makka and
everybody had started doing talbiya after seeing the new moon, I
saw that you did not do so until the eighth of Dhū al-Ḥijja.”
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar replied, “As for the corners, I only ever saw the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬touching the two Yamānī corners. As for the
sandals, I saw the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬wearing hairless sandals
and doing wuḍū’ in them, and I like wearing them. As for using
yellow dye, I saw the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬using it, and I also like
to use it for dyeing things with. As for doing talbiya, I never saw the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬begin doing so until he had set out on the
animal he was riding on (i.e. for Minā and ‘Arafa).”

254

ʿ

32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullah ibn

‘Umar used to pray in the mosque of Dhū al-Ḥulayfa, and then go
outside and get on his camel and when his camel had stood up he
would begin to do talbiya.
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ʿAbd al-

Mālik ibn Marwān had started to do talbiya at the mosque of Dhū
al-Ḥulayfa, after the animal he was riding on had stood up, and that
Abān ibn ‘Uthmān had told him to do this.

20.10 Raising the voice in talbiya
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm from ʿAbd al-Mālik ibn Abī
Bakr ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām from Khallād ibn as-Sā’ib al-Anṣārī
from his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Jibrīl came to
me and told me to tell my Companions, or whoever was with me, to
raise their voices when doing talbiya.”
35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard the people of

knowledge say, “Women do not have to raise their voices when they
are doing talbiya, and a woman should only speak loudly enough to
hear herself.”
Mālik said, “Someone who is in iḥrām should not raise his voice
when doing talbiya if he is in a mosque where there are groups of
people. He should only speak loudly enough for himself and those
who are near him to be able to hear, except in the Masjid al-Ḥarām
and the mosque at Minā where he should raise his voice.”
Mālik said, “I have heard some of the people of knowledge
recommending (people to do) talbiya at the end of every prayer and
at every rise on the route.”

20.11 Ḥajj al-ifrād
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū al-Aswad Muḥammad

ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān, from ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, that ‘Ā’isha, the
255

wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “We set out with the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in the year of the Farewell Ḥajj, and some of us went into
iḥrām to perform ‘umra, some of us went into iḥrām to perform ḥajj
and ‘umra, and some of us went into iḥrām to perform ḥajj on its
own. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬went into iḥrām to perform ḥajj on
its own. ose who had gone into iḥrām perform do ‘umra came out
of iḥrām (after doing ‘umra). ose who had gone into iḥrām to
perform hajj on its own (Ḥajj al-ifrād), or to perform both ḥajj and
‘umra (Ḥajj al-qirān), did not come out of iḥrām until the Day of
the Sacriﬁce.”
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik, from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim, from his father, from ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬performed Ḥajj al-Ifrād.

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik, from Abū al-Aswad
Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān, from ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, from
‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
performed Ḥajj al-Ifrād.
38

39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard the people of

knowledge say, “If someone goes into iḥrām to perform Ḥajj alifrād, he cannot then go into iḥrām to perform ‘umra.”
Mālik said, “is is what I have found the people of knowledge in
our city doing.”

20.12 Performing ḥajj and ‘umra together (Ḥajj al-Qirān)
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik, from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad,

from his father, that al-Miqdād ibn al-Aswad once went to see ‘Alī
ibn Abī Ṭālib at as-Suqyā, where he was feeding some young camels
of his with a mash of meal and leaves, and he said to him, “is
man ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān is telling people that they cannot perform
Ḥajj al-qirān.”
Al-Miqdād said, “‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib went oﬀ with bits of meal and
leaves on his forearms – and I shall never forget the sight of the
256

meal and the leaves on his arms – and went to see ‘Uthmān ibn
‘Aﬀān and asked him, ‘Are you saying then that people cannot
perform Ḥajj al-Qirān?’ ‘Uthmān replied, ‘at is my opinion.’
Whereupon ‘Alī got angry and went out saying, ‘I am at your
service, O Allah, I am at your service for Ḥajj al-Qirān.’”
Mālik said, “Our position (here in Madīna) is that someone who
does Ḥajj al-qirān should not remove any of his hair, nor should he
come out of iḥrām in any way until he has sacriﬁced an animal, if he
has one. He should come out of iḥrām at Minā, on the Day of
Sacriﬁce.”
41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān, from Sulaymān ibn Yasār, that when the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬, set out for ḥajj in the year of the Farewell Ḥajj, some of his
companions went into iḥrām to perform ḥajj on its own, some of
them combined ḥajj and ‘umra, and some went into iḥrām to
perform ‘umra on its own. ose who had gone into iḥrām to
perform ḥajj, or ḥajj and ‘umra together, did not come out of iḥrām,
whilst those who had gone into iḥrām to perform ‘umra (on its own)
came out of iḥrām.
42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard some of the

people of knowledge say, “If someone goes into iḥrām to perform
‘umra and then wants to go into iḥrām to do ḥajj as well, he can do
so, as long as he has not done ṭawāf of the House and sa‘y between
Safā and Marwa. is is what ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar did when he
said, ‘If I am blocked from the House we shall do what we did when
we were with the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.’ He then turned to his
companions and said, ‘It is the same either way. I call you to witness
that I have decided in favour of ḥajj and ‘umra together.’”
Mālik said, “e Companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬went
into iḥrām to perform ‘umra in the year of the Farewell Ḥajj, and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, said to them, ‘Anyone that has a sacriﬁcial
animal with him should go into iḥrām to perform ḥajj and ‘umra
257

together, and he should not come out of iḥrām until he has ﬁnished
both.’”

20.13 When to stop the talbiya
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr

ath-aqafī once asked Anas ibn Mālik, while the two of them were
going from Minā to ‘Arafa, “What did you use to do on this day
when you were with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ”?ﷺ‬He said, “ose of
us who were saying the talbiya would continue doing so, and no one
disapproved of it, and those of us who were saying ‘Allāhu akbar’
would continue doing so, and no one disapproved of that either.”
44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik, from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad,

from his father, that ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib used to say the talbiya while
on ḥajj until after noon on the Day of ‘Arafa, when he would stop
doing so.
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “is is what the people of knowledge in
our city are still doing.”
45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik, from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn alQāsim, from his father, that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬,

would stop saying the talbiya when she arrived at the place of
standing (i.e. ‘Arafa).

46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik, from Nāﬁ‘, that when ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar was doing ḥajj he would keep saying the talbiya until he
reached the Ḥaram and did ṭawāf of the House and sa‘y between
Safā and Marwa. He would then say the talbiya until he left Minā
to go to ‘Arafa, at which point he would stop doing so. If he was
doing ‘umra he would stop saying the talbiya on entering the
Ḥaram.
47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb used to say,

“ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar would never say the talbiya while he was
doing ṭawāf of the House.”
258

48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Alqama ibn Abī ‘Alqama

from his mother that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, used to camp on
the plain of ‘Arafa at a place called Namira, and then later she
changed to another place called al-Arak. She said, “‘Ā’isha, and
those who were with her, would say the talbiya while she was at the
place where they were camping, and then, when she had mounted
and set out towards the place of standing, she would stop doing so.”
She continued, “‘Ā’isha used to perform ‘umra when she was in
Makka after the Ḥajj was over, in the month of Dhū al-Ḥijja. en
she stopped doing that, and instead would set out before the new
moon of Muḥarram for al-Juḥfa, where she would stay until she saw
the new moon, and then, when she had seen the new moon, she
would go into iḥrām to perform ‘umra.”
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Umar

ibn ʿAbd al-‘Azīz was once going from Minā (to ‘Arafa) on the Day
of ‘Arafa and heard the takbīr being said loudly, so he sent the guard
to shout out to the people, “O people, you should be saying the
talbiya.”

20.14 How the people of Makka, and those besides them living
there, go into iḥrām
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Rahmān ibn al-

Qāsim from his father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “People of
Makka, why is it that people arrive dishevelled while you still have
oil on your hair? Go into iḥrām when you see the new moon.”
51 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

ʿAbdullāh ibn az-Zubayr stayed in Makka for nine years. He would
go into iḥrām for ḥajj at the beginning of Dhū al-Ḥijja, and ‘Urwa
ibn az-Zubayr, who was with him, would do likewise.

Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e people of Makka and whoever else
is living there besides them should go into iḥrām for ḥajj if they are

259

in Makka, and anyone that is living in the centre of Makka and is
not one of the people of Makka should not leave the Ḥaram.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “Someone who goes into iḥrām for ḥajj
in Makka should delay ṭawāf of the House and the sa‘y between
Safā and Marwa until he has come back from Minā, which is what
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to do.”
Mālik was asked what the people of Madīna, or anybody else,
should do about ṭawāf if they went into iḥrām in Makka at the
beginning of Dhū al-Ḥijja, and he said, “ey should delay the
obligatory ṭawāf, which is the one they combine with the sa‘y
between Ṣafā and Marwa, but they can do whatever other ṭawāf
they want to, and they should pray two rak‘as every time they
complete seven circuits, which is what the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, did when they had gone into iḥrām to do
ḥajj. ey delayed the ṭawāf of the House and the sa‘y between Ṣafā
and Marwa until they had come back from Mina. ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar also did this, going into iḥrām for ḥajj in Makka at the
beginning of Dhū al-Ḥijja, and then delaying ṭawāf of the House
and the sa‘y between Safā and Marwa until he had come back from
Minā.”
Mālik was asked whether one of the people of Makka could go into
iḥrām to do ‘umra in the centre of Makka, and he said, “No. He
should go outside the Ḥaram and go into iḥrām there.”

20.15 Situations when iḥrām is not obligatory for garlanding
sacriﬁcial animals
52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

ibn Muḥammad that ‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān told him that
Ziyād ibn Abī Sufyān once wrote to ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet
‫ﷺ‬, saying “ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said that whatever was unlawful
for someone performing ḥajj was also unlawful for someone who
sent a sacriﬁcial animal until the animal was sacriﬁced. I have sent

260

one, so write and tell me what you say about this, or tell the man in
charge of the animal what to do.”
‘Amra said that ‘Ā’isha said, “It is not as Ibn ‘Abbās has said. I once
plaited the garlands for the sacriﬁcial animal of the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬, with my own two hands. en after that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬put the garlands on the animal and then sent it with my
father. And there was nothing that Allah had made lawful for the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬that was unlawful for him until such time as
the animal had been sacriﬁced.”
53 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “I

asked ‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān if there was anything that was
unlawful for someone who sent a sacriﬁcial animal (to Makka) but
did not go there himself, and she told me that she had heard ‘Ā’isha
say, ‘It is only someone who goes into iḥrām for ḥajj and begins
saying the talbiya for whom things are unlawful.’”
54 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Hārith at-Taymī that Rabi‘a ibn
ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Ḥudayr once saw a man in a state of iḥrām in Iraq.
So he asked people about him and they said, “He has given
directions for his sacriﬁcial animal to be garlanded, and it is for that
reason that he has put on iḥrām.” Rabi‘a said, “I then met ʿAbdullāh
ibn az-Zubayr and so I mentioned this to him and he said, ‘By the
Lord of the Ka‘ba, an innovation!’”
Mālik was asked about someone who set out with his own sacriﬁcial
animal and marked it and garlanded it at Dhū al-Ḥulayfa, but did
not go into iḥrām until he had reached al-Juḥfa, and he said, “I do
not like that, and whoever does so has not acted properly. He should
only garland his sacriﬁcial animal or mark it when he goes into
iḥrām unless it is someone who does not intend to do ḥajj, in which
case he sends it oﬀ and stays with his family.”
Mālik was asked if someone who was not in iḥrām could set out
with a sacriﬁcial animal, and he said, “Yes. ere is no harm in
261

that.”
He was also asked to comment on the diﬀerent views people had
about what became unlawful for someone who garlanded a
sacriﬁcial animal but did not intend to perform either ḥajj or ‘umra,
and he said, “What we go by as far as this is concerned is what
‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, said: ‘e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent
his sacriﬁcial animal oﬀ and did not go there himself, and there was
nothing that Allah had made lawful for him that was unlawful for
him until the animal had been sacriﬁced.’”

20.16 Menstruating women on ḥajj
55 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “A menstruating woman who wants to go into
iḥrām to perform either ḥajj or ‘umra can do so if she so wishes, but
she cannot do ṭawāf of the House nor the sa‘y between Ṣafā and
Marwa. She can participate in all the rituals along with everybody
else, except that she cannot do ṭawāf of the House, nor the sa‘y
between Ṣafā and Marwa, nor can she come near the mosque until
she is pure.”

20.17 ‘Umra in the months of ḥajj
56 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬performed ‘umra three times: in the year of

Ḥudaybiya, in the year of al-Qaḍiyya (the Fulﬁlled ‘Umra), and in
the year of al-Ji‘irrāna.
57 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father, that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬only performed three

‘umras, one of them in Shawwāl, and two in Dhū al-Qa‘da.

58 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Rahmān ibn

Ḥarmala al-Aslamī that somebody asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab,
“Can I perform ‘umra before I perform ḥajj?” and Sa‘īd said, “Yes,
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬performed ‘umra before performing
ḥajj.”
262

59 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik, from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn Abī Salama once asked ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb for permission to perform ‘umra in Shawwāl. He gave him
permission, so he perform ‘umra and then went back to his family,
and he did not perform ḥajj.

20.18 When to stop saying the talbiya for ‘umra
60 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that this

father would stop saying the talbiya when he entered the Ḥaram if
he was performing ‘umra.
Mālik said that someone who went into iḥrām at at-Tan‘īm should
stop saying the talbiya when he saw the House.

Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked where a man from the people of
Madīna, or elsewhere, who had begun doing ‘umra at one of the
mīqāts, should stop saying the talbiya, and he said, “Someone who
goes into iḥrām at one of the mīqāts should stop saying the talbiya
when he arrives at the Ḥaram.”
Mālik added, “I have heard that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to do
that.”

20.19 Ḥajj at-Tamattu‘
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that
Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Nawfal ibn ʿAbd alMuṭṭalib told him that in the year when Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān
went on ḥajj he had heard Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ and aḍ-Ḍaḥḥāk ibn
Qays discussing tamattu‘ and combining ‘umra and ḥajj. Aḍ-Ḍaḥḥāk
ibn Qays said, “Only someone who is ignorant of what Allah, the
Exalted and Gloriﬁed, says would do that.” Whereupon Sa‘d said,
“How wrong is what you have just said, son of my brother!” AḍḌaḥḥāk said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb forbade that,” and Sa‘d
retorted, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did it and we did it with him.”
61

263

62 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṣadaqa ibn Yasār that

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “By Allah, I would rather perform ‘umra
before ḥajj and sacriﬁce an animal than perform ‘umra after ḥajj in
the month of Dhū al-Ḥijja.”
63 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār that

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to say, “Anyone who performs ‘umra in
the months of ḥajj, that is, in Shawwāl, Dhū al-Qa‘da, or Dhū alḤijja before the ḥajj, and then stays in Makka until the time for ḥajj,
is performing tamattu‘ if he then performs ḥajj. He must sacriﬁce
whatever animal it is easy for him to obtain, and if he cannot ﬁnd
one then he must fast three days during ḥajj and seven days when he
returns.”

Mālik said, “is is only the case if he stays until the ḥajj and
performs ḥajj in that same year.”
Mālik said that if someone who was from Makka, but had stopped
living there and gone to live elsewhere, came back to perform ‘umra
in the months of the ḥajj and then stayed in Makka to begin ḥajj
there, he was performing tamattu‘ and had to oﬀer up a sacriﬁcial
animal, or fast if he could not ﬁnd one. He was not the same as the
people of Makka.
Mālik was asked whether someone, who was not from Makka and
entered Makka to perform ‘umra in the months of ḥajj with the
intention of staying on to begin his ḥajj there, was performing
tamattu‘ or not, and he said, “Yes, he is performing tamattu‘, and he
is not the same as the people of Makka, even if he has the intention
of staying there. is is because he has entered Makka, but is not
one of its people, and making a sacriﬁce or fasting is incumbent on
anyone who is not from Makka, and, although he intends to stay, he
does not know what possibilities might arise later. He is not one of
the people of Makka.”
64 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd used to hear

Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, “Anyone who performs ‘umra in
264

Shawwāl, Dhū al-Qa‘da or Dhū al-Ḥijja and then stays in Makka
until it is time for the ḥajj is performing tamattu‘ if he then does
ḥajj. He must sacriﬁce whatever animal it is easy for him to obtain,
and if he cannot ﬁnd one then he must fast three days during ḥajj
and seven days when he returns.”

20.20 Circumstances in which tamattu‘ is not obligatory
65 Mālik said, “Someone who performs ‘umra in Shawwāl, Dhū al-

Qa‘da or Dhū al-Ḥijja and then goes back to his people, and then
returns and performs ḥajj in that same year does not have to sacriﬁce
an animal. Sacriﬁcing an animal is only incumbent on someone who
performs ‘umra in the months of ḥajj, and then stays in Makka and
then performs ḥajj. A person not from Makka who moves to Makka
and establishes his home there and performs ‘umra in the months of
the ḥajj and then begins his ḥajj there is not performing tamattu‘.
He does not have to sacriﬁce an animal nor does he have to fast. He
is in the same position as the people of Makka if he is one of those
who are living there.”
Mālik was asked whether a man from Makka who had gone to live
in another town or had been on a journey and then returned to
Makka with the intention of staying there, regardless of whether he
had a family there or not, and entered it to perform ‘umra in the
months of the ḥajj, and then began his ḥajj there, beginning his
‘umra at the mīqāt of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬or at a place nearer than that,
was doing tamattu‘ or not? Mālik answered, “He does not have to
sacriﬁce an animal or fast as someone who is doing tamattu‘ has to
do. is is because Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says in His
Book, ‘at is for someone whose family are not present at the
Masjid al-Ḥarām.’”

20.21 About ‘umra in general
66 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Rahmān, from Abū Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “‘Umra is an expiation
265

for what is between it and the next ‘umra, and the only reward for
an accepted ḥajj is the Garden.”
67 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān, heard Abū Bakr ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān
say, “A woman came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said, ‘I had
arranged to perform ḥajj, but I was prevented,’ and the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Perform ‘umra in Ramaḍān, for performing ‘umra
in it is like performing ḥajj.’”
68 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Keep your ḥajj separate from
your ‘umra: that way your ḥajj will be more complete, and your
‘umra will be more complete if you perform it outside of the months
of the ḥajj.”
69 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Uthmān

ibn ‘Aﬀān would sometimes never dismount from the animal he was
riding on when he was doing ‘umra until he had returned.
Mālik said, “‘Umra is a sunna, and we do not know of any Muslim
who has ever said that it is permissible not to do it.”
Mālik said, “I do not think that anyone can do more than one ‘umra
in any one year.”
Mālik said that someone doing ‘umra who had sexual intercourse
with his wife had to sacriﬁce an animal and do a second ‘umra,
which he had to begin when he had ﬁnished the one that he had
spoiled and that he should go into iḥrām at the same place where he
went into iḥrām for the ‘umra which he had spoiled, except if he
had entered into iḥrām at a place further away than his mīqāt. is
was because he only had to go into iḥrām from his mīqāt.
Mālik said, “Someone who enters Makka to perform ‘umra, and
does ṭawāf of the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa while he
is in janāba, or not in wuḍū’, and afterwards has intercourse with his
wife and then remembers, should do ghusl or wuḍū’, and then go
266

back and do ṭawāf around the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and
Marwa and perform another ‘umra and sacriﬁce an animal. A
woman should do the same if her husband has intercourse with her
while she is in iḥrām.”
Mālik said, “As for beginning ‘umra at at-Tan‘īm, (it is not the only
alternative). It is permissible if Allah wills for some one to leave the
Ḥaram and go into iḥrām if he wishes, but the best way is for him to
go into iḥrām at the mīqāt which the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used
(i.e. at-Tan‘īm) or one which is further away.”

20.22 Marriage while in iḥrām
70 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbd arRaḥmān from Sulaymān ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

sent Abū Rāﬁ‘ and a man of the Anṣār to arrange his marriage to
Maymūna bint al-Ḥārith, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was in
Madīna before he had left for ‘umra.
71 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘, from Nubayh ibn

Wahb, who was from the tribe of Banū ʿAbd ad-Dār, that ‘Umar
ibn ‘Ubaydullāh sent a message to Abān ibn ‘Uthmān (who was
amīr of the ḥajj at the time), while both of them were in iḥrām,
saying “I want give the daughter of Shayba ibn Jubayr in marriage to
Ṭalḥa ibn ‘Umar and I want you to be present.” Abān told him that
he should not do that and said, “I heard ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān say that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘A man in iḥrām should not marry,
or give in marriage, or get betrothed.’”
72 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwūd ibn al-Ḥusayn that

Abū Ghaṭafān ibn Ṭarīf al-Murrī told him that his father Ṭarīf had
married a woman while he was in iḥrām, and ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
had rescinded the marriage.
73 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Someone in iḥrām may neither get married, nor
arrange a marriage for himself or others.”
267

74 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab, Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh and Sulaymān ibn Yasār were
asked about whether someone in iḥrām could get married, and they
said, “Someone in iḥrām may neither get married nor give someone
in marriage.”

Mālik said that a man who was in iḥrām could take his wife back, if
he wanted to, if she was still in her ‘idda after she had been divorced
from him.

20.23 Cupping while in iḥrām
75 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from
Sulaymān ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was once

cupped on the top of his head while he was in iḥrām at Laḥya Jamal,
which is a place on the road to Makka.

76 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Someone in iḥrām should not be cupped except
when there is no other alternative.”

Mālik said, “Someone who is in iḥrām should not be cupped except
when it is absolutely necessary.”

20.24 Game that can be eaten by someone who is in iḥrām
77 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh at-Taymī from Nāﬁ‘, the mawlā of Abū
Qatāda al-Anṣārī, that Abū Qatāda was once with the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬. When they got to one of the roads to Makka he fell
behind with some Companions of his who were in iḥrām, while he
was not. en he saw a wild ass, so he got on his mount and asked
his companions to give him his whip but they refused. en he
asked them for his spear and they refused to give it to him. So he
took hold of it and attacked the ass and killed it. Some of the
companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ate from it, and others
refused. When they had caught up with the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬,
268

they asked him about it and he said, “It is food that Allah has fed
you with.”
78 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that az-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwām used to take dried gazelle
meat (ṣafīf aẓ-ẓibā’) as provisions while he was in iḥrām.
Mālik explained, “Ṣafīf are dried strips of meat.”

79 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that ‘Atā’

ibn Yasār had told him from Abū Qatāda the same ḥadīth about the
wild ass as that of Abū an-Naḍr, except that in the ḥadīth of Zayd
ibn Aslam the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked, “Do you still have any
of its meat?”
80 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd al-Anṣārī

said that Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī told him
from ‘Īsā ibn Ṭalha ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from ‘Umayr ibn Salama aḍḌamri, from al-Bahzī, that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬set out once
for Makka while in iḥrām. When they had reached ar-Rawḥā’, they
unexpectedly came upon a wounded wild ass. Someone mentioned
it to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he said, “Leave it. e man to
whom it belongs is about to come.” en al-Bahzī, the man himself,
came to the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and said, ‘Messenger of Allah, do whatever
you want with this ass,’ and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told Abū
Bakr to divide it up among the company. en they went on until
they came to the well of al-Uthāba, which was located between arRuwaytha and al-‘Arj (between Makka and Madīna), where they
unexpectedly came upon a gazelle with an arrow in it, lying on its
side in some shade. He claimed that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told
someone to stand by it to make sure no one disturbed it until
everyone had passed by.
81 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab relating from Abū Hurayra that he was
once coming back from Bahrain, and, when he reached ar-Rabadha,
he found a caravan of people from Iraq in iḥrām, who asked him
269

whether they could eat the meat of some game which they had
found with the people of ar-Rabadha, and he told them they could
eat it. He said, “Afterwards I had doubts about what I had told
them to do, so when I got back to Madīna I mentioned the matter
to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and he said, ‘What did you tell them to
do?’ I said, ‘I told them to eat it.’ ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said,
threatening me, ‘If you had told them to do anything else I would
have done something to you.’”
82 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh heard Abū Hurayra relating to ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar how
a group of three people in iḥrām had passed him at ar-Rabadha and
had asked him for a fatwā about eating game which people who
were not in iḥrām were eating, and he told them that they could eat
it. He said, “en I went to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb in Madīna and
asked him about it, and he said, ‘What did you say to them?’ and I
said, ‘I told them that they could eat it.’ ‘Umar said, ‘If you had told
them anything else I would have done you an injury.’”
83 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār that Ka‘b al-Aḥbar was once coming back from Syria with
a group of riders, and at a certain point along the road they found
some game-meat and Ka‘b said they could eat it. When they got
back to Madīna they went to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and told him
about that, and he said, “Who told you that you could do that?” and
they answered, “Ka‘b.” He said, “He was indeed the one I put in
charge of you until you should return.”
Later, when they were on the road to Makka, a swarm of locusts
passed them by and Ka‘b told them to catch them and eat them.
When they got back to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb they told him about
this, and he said (to Ka‘b), “What made you tell them they could do
that?” Ka‘b said, “It is game of the sea.” He said, “How do you
know?” and Ka‘b said, “Amīr al-Mu’minīn, by the One in whose
hand my self is, it is only the sneeze of a ﬁsh which it sneezes twice
every year.”
270

Mālik was asked whether someone in iḥrām could buy game that he
had found on the way. He replied, “Game that is only hunted to be
oﬀered to people performing ḥajj I disapprove of and forbid, but
there is no harm in game that a man has which he does not intend
for those in iḥrām, but which a someone in iḥrām comes across and
buys.”
Mālik said, about someone who had some game with him that he
had hunted or bought at the time when he had entered into iḥrām,
that he did not have to get rid of it, and that there was no harm in
him giving it to his family.
Mālik said that it was lawful for someone in iḥrām to ﬁsh in the sea
or in rivers and lakes, etc.

20.25 Game that is not lawful to eat while in iḥrām
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from
‘Ubaydullāh ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd from ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Abbās that aṣ-Ṣa‘b ibn Jaththāma al-Laythī once gave a wild ass
to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬while he was at al-Abwā’ or Waddān,
and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave it back to him. However, when
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬saw the expression on the man’s face he
said, “We only gave it back to you because we are in iḥrām.”
84

85 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

that ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a said, “I once saw
‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān in iḥrām on a hot summer’s day at al-‘Arj, and
he had covered his face with a red woollen cloth. Some game-meat
was brought to him and he told his companions to eat. ey asked,
‘Will you not eat then?’ and he replied, ‘I am not in the same
position as you. It was hunted for my sake.’”
86 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa, from

his father that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, said to him, “Son of my
sister, it is only for ten nights, so if you get an urge for it, leave it,”
by which she meant eating game-meat.
271

Mālik said that if game was hunted for the sake of a man who was
in iḥrām and it was prepared for him and he ate some of it knowing
that it had been hunted for his sake, then he had to pay a forfeit for
all of the game that had been hunted on his behalf.
Mālik was asked about whether someone who was forced to eat
carrion while he was in iḥrām should hunt game and then eat that
rather than the carrion, and he said, “It is better for him to eat the
carrion, because Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, has not give
permission for someone in iḥrām to either eat game or take it in any
situation, but He has made allowances for eating carrion when
absolutely necessary.”
Mālik said, “It is not lawful for anyone, whether in iḥrām or not, to
eat game which has been killed or sacriﬁced by someone in iḥrām,
because, whether it was killed deliberately or by mistake, it was not
done in a lawful manner, and so eating it is not lawful. I have heard
this from more than one person. Somebody who kills game and
then eats it only has to make a single kaﬀāra, which is the same as
for somebody who kills game but does not eat any of it.”

20.26 Hunting in the Ḥaram
87 Mālik said, “It is not lawful to eat any game that has been hunted

in the Ḥaram, or has had a dog set after it in the Ḥaram and then
been killed outside the Ḥaram. Anyone who does that has to pay a
forfeit for what has been hunted. However, someone that sets his
dog after game outside the Ḥaram and then follows it until it is
hunted down in the Ḥaram does not have to pay any forfeit, unless
he set the dog after the game near to the Ḥaram. e game,
however, should not be eaten. If he set the dog loose near the
Ḥaram then he has to pay a forfeit for the game.”

20.27 Assessing the forfeit for hunting game animals
88 Mālik said, “Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says, ‘O you who

believe, do not kill game while you are in iḥrām. If one of you kills
272

any deliberately, the reprisal for it is a livestock animal equivalent to
what he killed, as judged by two just men among you, a sacriﬁce to
reach the Ka‘ba, or expiation by feeding the poor, or fasting
commensurate to that, so that he may taste the evil consequences of
what he did.’” (5:95).
Mālik said, “Someone who hunts game when he is not in iḥrām and
then kills it while he is in iḥrām is in the same position as someone
who buys game while he is in iḥrām and then kills it. Allah has
forbidden killing it, and so a man who does so has to pay a forfeit
for it. e position that we go by in this matter is that a forfeit is
assessed for anyone who kills game while he is in iḥrām.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e best that I have heard about
someone who kills game and is assessed for it is that the game
which he has killed is assessed and its value in food is estimated and
with that food he feeds each poor man a mudd, or fasts a day in
place of each mudd. e number of poor men is considered, and if it
is ten then he fasts ten days, and if it is twenty he fasts twenty days,
according to how many people there are to be fed, even if there are
more than sixty.”
Mālik said, “I have heard that a forfeit is assessed for someone who
kills game in the Ḥaram while he is not in iḥrām in the same way
that it is assessed for someone who kills game in the Ḥaram while he
is in iḥrām.”

20.28 Animals that someone in iḥrām can kill
89 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere are ﬁve kinds of

animal which it is not wrong for someone in iḥrām to kill: crows,
kites, scorpions, rats and mice, and wild dogs.”

90 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullah ibn Dinār from
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere

273

are ﬁve (kinds of ) animal which it is not wrong for someone in
iḥrām to kill: scorpions, rats and mice, crows, kites and wild dogs.”
91 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere are ﬁve kinds

of vicious animals that can be killed in the Ḥaram: rats and mice,
scorpions, crows, kites and wild dogs.”
92 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb told people to kill snakes in the Ḥaram.

Mālik said, about the “wild dogs” which people were told to kill in
the Ḥaram, that any animals that wounded, attacked or terrorised
men, such as lions, leopards, cheetahs and wolves, were counted as
“wild dogs.” However, someone who was in iḥrām should not kill
beasts of prey that did not attack (people), such as hyenas, foxes,
cats and anything else like them, and if he did then he had to pay a
forfeit for it. Similarly, someone in iḥrām should not kill any
predatory birds except the kinds that the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬speciﬁed,
namely crows and kites. If someone in iḥrām killed any other kind
of bird he had to pay a forfeit for it.

20.29 ings that someone in iḥrām is allowed to do
93 Yaḥyā related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Muḥammad ibn

Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbdullāh ibn
al-Hudayr that he saw ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb taking the ticks oﬀ a
camel of his at as-Suqyā while he was in iḥrām.
Mālik said that he disapproved of that.

94 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Alqama ibn Abī ‘Alqama
that his mother said, “I heard ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬

being asked whether someone in iḥrām could scratch their body or
not, and she said, ‘Yes, he can scratch it and do so as hard as he
pleases. I would scratch even if my hands were tied and I could only
use my feet.’”
274

95 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ayyūb ibn Mūsā that

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar once looked in the mirror for something that
was irritating him while he was in iḥrām.
96 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar did not like people who were in iḥrām removing mites or
ticks from their camels.

Mālik said, “is is what I like most out of what I have heard about
the matter.”
97 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdullāh

ibn Abī Maryam once asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab about (what to
do with) one of his nails that had broken while he was in iḥrām and
Sa‘īd said, “Cut it oﬀ.”
Mālik was asked whether someone in iḥrām who had an earcomplaint could use medicinal oil which was not perfumed for
dropping into his ears, and he said, “I do not see any harm in that,
and even if he were to put it into his mouth I still would not see any
harm in it.”

Mālik said that there was no harm in someone in iḥrām lancing an
abscess that he had, or a boil, or cutting a vein, if he needed to do
so.

20.30 Performing the ḥajj for somebody else
98 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sulaymān

ibn Yasār that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said, “Al-Faḍl ibn ‘Abbās was
riding behind the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬when a woman from the
Khath‘ama tribe came to him to ask him for a fatwā. Al-Faḍl began
to look at her, and she at him, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
turned Faḍl’s face away to the other side. e woman said,
‘Messenger of Allah, Allah’s making the ḥajj obligatory ﬁnds my
father a very old man, unable to stay ﬁrm on his riding-beast. Can I
do ḥajj on his behalf?’ and he said, ‘Yes.’ is was during the
Farewell Ḥajj.”
(

275

20.31 Someone whose path (to the House) is blocked by an
enemy
99 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “Someone whose passage to

the House is blocked by an enemy is freed from every restriction of
iḥrām, and should sacriﬁce his animal and shave his head wherever
he has been detained, and there is nothing for him to make up
afterwards.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that when the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and his Companions came out of iḥrām at
al-Ḥudaybiya they sacriﬁced their sacriﬁcial animals and shaved
their heads, and were freed from all the restrictions of iḥrām
without having done ṭawāf of the House and without their sacriﬁcial
animals iḥrām the Ka‘ba.
ere is nothing known about the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ever
telling any of his companions or anybody else that was with him, to
make up for anything they had missed or to go back to do anything
they had not ﬁnished doing.
100 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that when ʿAbdullāh

ibn ‘Umar set out for Makka during the troubles (between al-Ḥajjāj
ibn Yūsuf and Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwām) he said, “If I am blocked
from going to the House we shall do what we did when we were
with the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬,” and he went into iḥrām for ‘umra
because that was what the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did in the year of
al-Ḥudaybiya. But afterwards he reconsidered his position and said,
“It is the same either way.” After that he turned to his companions
and said, “It is the same either way. I call you to witness that I have
decided in favour of ḥajj and ‘umra together.” He then got through
to the House (without being stopped) and did one ṭawāf, which he
considered to be enough for himself, and sacriﬁced an animal.
Mālik said, “is is what we go by if someone is hindered by an
enemy, as the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and his companions were. If someone is

276

hindered by anything other than an enemy, he is only freed from
iḥrām by ṭawāf of the House.”

20.32 Someone who is prevented (from going to the House) by
something other than an enemy
101 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim

ibn ʿAbdullāh that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “Someone who is held
back from going to the House by illness can only come out of iḥrām
after he has done ṭawāf of the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and
Marwa. If it is absolutely necessary for him to wear any ordinary
clothes or undergo medical treatment, he should do that and pay
compensation for it.”
102 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he
had heard that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, used to say, “Only

the House frees a person in iḥrām from iḥrām.”

103 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ayyūb ibn Abī Tamīma

as-Sakhtiyānī that a very old man from Basra once said to him, “I
set out for Makka but on the way there I broke my thigh, so I sent a
message on to Makka. ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās and ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar and the people were there, but no one allowed me to leave
iḥrām, and I stayed there for seven months until I left iḥrām by
doing an ‘umra.”
104 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim

ibn ʿAbdullāh that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “Someone who is
detained by sickness before he has got to the House cannot leave
iḥrām until he has done ṭawāf of the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā
and Marwa.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from
Sulaymān ibn Yasār that Sa‘īd ibn Ḥuzāba al-Makhzūmī was
thrown oﬀ his mount while he was in iḥrām on the road to Makka.
He asked after the person in charge of the relay station where he
was injured and he found ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar, ʿAbdullāh ibn az277

Zubayr and Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam there. He told them what had
happened to him and all of them said that he should take whatever
medicine he had to take and pay compensation for it. en, when
he got better again, he should perform ‘umra and come out of his
iḥrām, after which he had to perform ḥajj the next year and to oﬀer
whatever sacriﬁcial animal he was able to in the future.
Mālik said, “is is what we do here (in Madīna) if someone is
detained by something other than an enemy. And when Abū Ayyūb
al-Ansārī and Habbār ibn al-Aswad arrived on the Day of Sacriﬁce,
having missed the ḥajj, ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb told them to come out
of iḥrām by doing ‘umra and then to go home free of iḥrām and
perform ḥajj sometime in the future and to sacriﬁce an animal, or, if
they could not ﬁnd one, to fast three days during the ḥajj and seven
days after they had returned to their families.”
Mālik said, “Anyone who is detained from performing ḥajj after he
has gone into iḥrām, whether by illness or otherwise, or by an error
in calculating the month or because the new moon is concealed
from him, is in the same position as someone who is hindered from
performing the ḥajj and must do the same as he does.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked about the situation of someone
from Makka who went into iḥrām for ḥajj and then broke a bone or
had severe stomach pain, or of a woman who gives birth, and he
said, “Someone to whom this happens is in the same situation as
one who is hindered from performing ḥajj, and he must do the same
as people from outlying regions do when they are hindered from
performing ḥajj.”
Mālik said about someone who arrived in the months of the ḥajj
with the intention of performing ‘umra, and completed his ‘umra
and went into iḥrām in Makka to perform ḥajj, and then broke a
bone or something else happened to him which stopped him from
being present at ‘Arafa with everybody else: “I think that he should
stay where he is until he is better and then go outside the area of the
Ḥaram, and then return to Makka and do ṭawāf of the House and
278

sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa, and then leave iḥrām. He must then
perform ḥajj again the next year and oﬀer a sacriﬁcial animal.”
Mālik said about someone who left iḥrām in Makka, and then did
ṭawāf of the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa, and then fell
ill and was unable to be present with everybody at ‘Arafa: “If
someone miss the ḥajj, he should, if he can, go out of the area of the
Ḥaram and then come back in again to perform ‘umra and do ṭawāf
of the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa, because he had not
intended his initial ṭawāf to be for an ‘umra, and so for this reason
he does it again. He must perform the next ḥajj and oﬀer a sacriﬁcial
animal.
“If he is not one of the people of Makka, and something happens to
him which stops him from performing the ḥajj, but he does ṭawāf of
the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa, he should come out of
iḥrām by doing an ‘umra and then do ṭawāf of the House a second
time, and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa, because his initial ṭawāf
and sa‘y were intended for the ḥajj. He must do the next ḥajj and
oﬀer a sacriﬁcial animal.

20.33 Building the Ka‘ba
105 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim

ibn ʿAbdullāh that ʿAbdullāh ibn Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr aṣṢiddīq told ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar from ‘Ā’isha, that the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬
said, “Do you not see that when your people built the Ka‘ba they fell
short of the foundations of Ibrāhīm?” ‘Ā’isha said, “Messenger of
Allah, will you not restore it to the foundations of Ibrāhīm?” and
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If it were not that your people have
only recently left disbelief, I would have done so.”
Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh added that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “If
‘Ā’isha heard this from the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, then I consider
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬only refrained from greeting the two
corners which are adjacent to the Ḥijr because the House had not

279

been completed on the foundations of Ibrāhīm.” (i.e. the corners he
did not touch were not the original corners of the Ka‘ba.)
106 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, said, “I do not mind
whether I pray in the Hijr or in the House.” (i.e. praying in the Ḥijr
is the same as praying in the House.)
107 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard Ibn Shihāb say

that he had heard one of the people of knowledge say that the Ḥijr
was only enclosed so that people would go beyond it when they
were making ṭawāf, and their ṭawāf would therefore encompass the
original House.

20.34 Hastening (raml) in the ṭawāf
108 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad

from his father that Jābir ibn ʿAbdullāh said, “I saw the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬hastening from the Black Stone until he reached it
again, three times.”

Mālik said, “is is what is still done by the people of knowledge in
our city (Madīna).”
109 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to hasten from the Black Stone round to the Black
Stone three times and then would walk four circuits normally.
110 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

when his father did ṭawāf of the House he would hasten in the ﬁrst
three circuits and say in a low voice, “O Allah, there is no god but
You, and You bring to life after You have made to die.”
Allāhumma lā ilāha illā anta wa anta tuḥyī ba‘da mā amatt.
111 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that he saw ʿAbdullāh ibn az-Zubayr go into iḥrām for

280

‘umra at at-Tan‘īm. He said, “en I saw him hasten around the
House for three circuits.”
112 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar never used to do ṭawāf of the House or sa‘y between Ṣafā and
Marwa if he went into iḥrām in Makka until he had returned from
Minā, nor would he hasten when doing ṭawāf of the House if he
went into iḥrām in Makka.

20.35 Saluting the corners during ṭawāf
113 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that when the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had ﬁnished his ṭawāf of the House and

prayed two rak‘as, and wanted to go to Ṣafā and Marwa, he would
salute the corner of the Black Stone before he left.

114 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that
his father said that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬once said to ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf, “What do you do, Abū Muḥammad, when
saluting the corner?” and ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān said, “Sometimes I salute
it, and sometimes I do not.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “You
are right.”

115 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father used to salute all the corners when he did ṭawāf of the
House and did not omit the Yamānī corner unless prevented.

20.36 Kissing the corner of the Black Stone when saluting the
corners
116 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said to the corner of the Black
Stone while he was doing ṭawāf of the House, “You are only a stone,
and if I had not seen the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬kiss you, I would
not do so.” en he kissed it.
Mālik said, “I have heard some of the people of knowledge
recommending someone doing ṭawāf of the House to put his hand
281

to his mouth when he takes it from the Yamānī corner.”

20.37 e two rak‘as of ṭawāf
117 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father would never do two sets of seven circuits together without
praying between them. After every seven circuits he would pray two
rak‘as, sometimes at the Maqām of Ibrāhīm, and sometimes
elsewhere.
Mālik was asked whether a man doing voluntary ṭawāf could, to
make it easier on himself, join two or more sets of seven circuits and
then pray whatever he owed for those sets of seven, and he said, “He
should not do that. e sunna is that he does two rak‘as after every
seven circuits.”
Mālik said about someone, who began doing ṭawāf and then forgot
how many circuits he had done and did eight or nine, “He should
stop when he knows that he has done more than the right number
and then pray two rak‘as, and he should not count the ones that he
has done in excess. Neither should he build on the nine that he has
done and then pray the rak‘as for the two sets of seven circuits
together, because the sunna is that you pray two rak‘as after every
seven circuits.”
Mālik said, “Someone who was in doubt about his ṭawāf after he
had prayed the two rak‘as of ṭawāf should go back and complete his
ṭawāf until he was certain of how much he had done. He should
then repeat the two rak‘as, because prayer when doing ṭawāf was
only valid after completing seven circuits.”
Mālik said, “If someone breaks his wuḍū’ either while he is doing
ṭawāf, or when he has ﬁnished ṭawāf but before he has prayed the
two rak‘as of ṭawāf, he should do wuḍū’ and begin the ṭawāf and the
two rak‘as afresh.”
Mālik said, “Breaking wuḍū’ does not interrupt sa‘y between Ṣafā
and Marwa, but a person should not begin sa‘y unless he is pure by
282

being in wuḍū’.’”

20.38 Praying after Ṣubḥ and ‘Aṣr when doing ṭawāf
118 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ḥumayd

ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf that ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ʿAbd alQārī mentioned to him that he once did ṭawāf of the House with
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb after Ṣubḥ and when ‘Umar had ﬁnished his
ṭawāf he looked and saw that the sun had not yet risen, so he rode
on until he made his camel kneel at Dhū Ṭuwā, and he prayed two
rak‘as.
119 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

said, “I saw ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās doing ṭawāf after ‘Aṣr. en he
went into his room and I do not know what he did.”

120 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

said, “I saw the House deserted both after Ṣubḥ and ‘Aṣr, with no
one doing ṭawāf.”
Mālik said, “If someone does some of his circuits and then Ṣubḥ and
‘Aṣr prayer is begun, he should pray with the imām and then
complete the rest of his circuits but should not pray at all until the
sun has either risen or set.”
He added, “ere is no harm in delaying the two rak‘as until after
he has prayed Maghrib.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in someone doing a single ṭawāf after
Ṣubḥ or after ‘Aṣr, but not more than that, and even then only as
long as he delays the two rak‘as until after the sun has risen, as
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb did, or until after the sun has set if it is after
‘Aṣr. en when the sun has set he can pray them if he wants, or, if
he wants, he can delay them until after he has prayed Maghrib.
ere is no harm in that.”

20.39 Taking leave of the House
283

ʿ

121 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “No one should leave the ḥajj
until he has done ṭawāf of the House, and ṭawāf of the House is the
ﬁnal rite.”
Mālik said, commenting about ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb’s saying ‘...
ṭawāf of the House is the ﬁnal rite’, “In our opinion, and Allah
knows best, that is because Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says, ‘As
for those who honour Allah’s sacred rites, that comes from the fear
of Allah within their hearts’ (22:32), and He says, ‘en their place
of sacriﬁce is by the Ancient House.’ (22:33) erefore the place of
all the rituals and their ending should be at the Ancient House.”
122 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb refused to let one man who had not taken
leave of the House pass aẓ-Ẓahrān, (a valley eighteen miles from
Makka) until he had taken leave of it.
123 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father said, “Allah has completed the ḥajj of anyone who does
the Ṭawāf al-Ifāda. It is ﬁtting that ṭawāf of the House be the last of
his aﬀair, as long as nothing prevents him, and if something
prevents him or an obstacle arises, then Allah has completed his
ḥajj.”

Mālik said, “I do not think that a man who does not come to know
that the last of his aﬀair is ṭawāf of the House until he has left owes
anything unless he is nearby and can return, do ṭawāf, and then
leave having done the Ṭawāf al-Ifāda.”

20.40 Tawāf in general
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū al-Aswad
Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Nawfal from ‘Urwa ibn azZubayr from Zaynab bint Abī Salama that Umm Salama, the wife
of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I once complained to the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬that I was ill and he said, ‘Do ṭawāf riding behind the
124

284

people.’ So I performed ṭawāf riding my camel, while the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was praying by the side of the House, reciting Sūrat atṬūr (52).”
125 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

that Abū Mā‘iz al-Aslamī ʿAbdullāh ibn Sufyān told him that once,
when he was sitting with ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar, a woman came to
ask him for an opinion. She said, “I set out intending to do ṭawāf of
the House, but then, when I got to the gate of the Mosque, I started
bleeding, so I went back until it had left me. en I set out again,
and then, when I got to the gate of the Mosque, I started bleeding,
so I went back until it had left me. en I set oﬀ again, and then,
when I got to the gate of the Mosque, I started bleeding.” ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Umar said, “at is only an impulse from Shayṭān. Do ghusl,
then bind your private parts with a cloth and do ṭawāf.”
126 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that if Sa‘d

ibn Abī Waqqāṣ entered Makka late, he would go to ‘Arafa before
doing ṭawāf of the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa, and
then do ṭawāf when he got back.
Mālik said, “e leeway is broad, if Allah wills.”
Mālik was asked whether somebody who was doing obligatory ṭawāf
could stop and talk with another man, and he said, “I do not like
him to do that.”
Mālik said, “Only someone who is pure (by being in wuḍū’) should
do ṭawāf of the House or sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa.”

20.41 Starting with Safā in the sa‘y
127 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad ibn

‘Alī from his father that Jābir ibn ʿAbdullāh said, “I heard the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say as he left the Mosque, intending to go to
Ṣafā, ‘We begin with what Allah began,’ and he began with Ṣafā.”

285

128 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad ibn

‘Alī from his father from Jābir ibn ʿAbdullāh that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to say, “Allah is greater” three times when he stopped
on Ṣafā, and “ere is no god but Allah, alone, without any partner.
To Him belong the Kingdom and praise, and He has power over
everything” three times, and make supplication. He would then do
the same on Marwa.
129 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that he heard

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar making supplication on Ṣafā saying, “O Allah,
You have said, ‘Call on Me – I will answer you’ and You do not
break Your promise. So I am asking You, in the same way that You
have guided me to Islam, not to take it away from me, and that You
make me die while I am Muslim.”

20.42 Sa‘y in general
130 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father said, “Once when I was young I said to ‘Ā’isha, Umm alMu’minīn, ‘’Have you heard the saying of Allah, the Blessed and
Exalted, “Ṣafā and Marwa are among the Sacred Landmarks of
Allah, so anyone who goes on ḥajj to the House or does ‘umra incurs
no wrong in going back and forth between them” (2:158)? So it
follows that there should be no harm for someone who does not go
between them. By Allah, so there is no harm in not going between
Ṣafā and Marwa.’ ‘Ā’isha said, ‘No, if it was as you say, it would have
been, “ere is no harm in him not doing going back and forth
between them.” However, this āyat was revealed about the Anṣār.
ey used to make pilgrimage to Manāt, and Manāt was an idol
near Qudayd, and they used to avoid going between Ṣafā and
Marwa, so when Islam came they asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
about this and Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, revealed, “Ṣafā and
Marwa are among the Sacred Landmarks of Allah, so anyone who
goes on ḥajj to the House or does ‘umra incurs no wrong in going
back and forth between them.”’”

286

131 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

Sawda bint ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar, who was in the household of
‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, set oﬀ walking between Ṣafā and Marwa
when doing either ḥajj or ‘umra. She was a heavy woman and she
began when everybody was leaving after the ‘Ishā’ prayer, and she
still had not completed her circuits when the ﬁrst call was given for
Ṣubḥ, but ﬁnished them between the two calls to prayer. If ‘Urwa
saw people doing circuits on riding beasts he would tell them in very
strong terms not to do so, and they would pretend to be ill, out of
awe of him.
[Hishām added], “He used to say to us about them, ‘ese are the
unsuc-cessful and have lost.’”

Mālik said, “Someone who forgets sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa in
an ‘umra, and does not remember until he is far from Makka,
should return and do sa‘y. If, in the meantime, he has had
intercourse with a woman, he should return and do sa‘y between
Ṣafā and Marwa so as to complete what remains of that ‘umra, and
then after that he has to perform another ‘umra and oﬀer a
sacriﬁcial animal.”
Mālik was asked about someone who met another man when doing
sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa and stopped to talk with him, and he
said, “I do not like anyone to do that.”
Mālik said, “If anyone forgets some of his ṭawāf, or is uncertain
about it, and remembers only when he is doing sa‘y between Ṣafā
and Marwa, he should stop the sa‘y and complete his ṭawāf of the
House, apart from that about which he is certain. After that he
prays the two rak‘as of the ṭawāf, and then begins his sa‘y between
Ṣafā and Marwa.”
132 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad

from his father from Jābir ibn ʿAbdullah that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬, walked when he came down from Ṣafā and Marwa and

287

then, when he reached the middle of the valley, he broke into a light
run until he had left it.
Mālik said, about a man who, out of ignorance, did the sa‘y between
Ṣafā and Marwa before he had done ṭawāf of the House, “He
should go back and do ṭawāf of the House and then do sa‘y between
Ṣafā and Marwa. If he does not learn about this until he has left
Makka and is far away, he should return to Makka and do ṭawāf of
the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa. If in the meantime he
has had intercourse with a woman, he should return and do ṭawāf of
the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa so that he completes
what he owes of that ‘umra. en, after that, he has to perform
another ‘umra and oﬀer a sacriﬁcial animal.”

20.43 Fasting the Day of ‘Arafa
133 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā

of ‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from ‘Umayr, the mawlā of ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Abbās, from Umm al-Faḍl bint al-Ḥārith, that she was present
when some people were arguing on the Day of ‘Arafa about whether
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was fasting or not. Some of them said he
was fasting and some of them said he was not. So she sent a bowl of
milk to him while his camel was standing still and he drank.
134 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, used to fast
on the Day of ‘Arafa.
Al-Qāsim said, “I saw her, when the imām began moving away
(after sunset) on the afternoon of ‘Arafa, stay where she was until
the ground between her and the people became clear. en she
asked for something to drink and broke her fast.”

20.44 Fasting on the Days of Minā
135 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā

of ‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from Sulaymān ibn Yasār that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade fasting on the Days of Minā.
136 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent ʿAbdullāh ibn Ḥudhāfa out on the Days

of Mina to circulate among the people to tell them those days were
for eating and drinking and remembrance of Allah.

137 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā

ibn Ḥabbān from al-A‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade fasting on two days: the day of the ‘Īd al-Fiṭr and
the day of the ‘Īd al-Aḍḥā.
138 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn ʿAbdullāh ibn

al-Hādi from Abū Murra, the mawlā of Umm Hāni’, the sister of
‘Aqīl ibn Abī Ṭālib, that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ told him that
Ā
289

he had visited his father ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ and found him eating. His
father had invited him to eat and, when he replied that he was
fasting, his father said, “ese are the days on which the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade us to fast, and told us to break the fast on
them.”
Mālik said, “ese days are the Days of Tashrīq.”

20.45 What are acceptable as sacriﬁcial animals (hadys)
139 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn

Abī Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sacriﬁced a camel, which had belonged to Abū Jahl ibn
Hishām, in either a ḥajj or an ‘umra.
140 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬saw a man

driving forward a camel, which he was going to sacriﬁce, and he
told him to ride it. e man said, “Messenger of Allah, it is an
animal that I am going to sacriﬁce,” and he replied, “Ride it,
confound you!” either two or three times.
141 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Dīnār that

he used to see ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar sacriﬁcing animals two at a time
during ḥajj and one at a time during ‘umra. He said, “I saw him
sacriﬁce an animal during an ‘umra outside the house of Khālid ibn
Usayd, where he was staying. I saw him stick his spear in the throat
of the animal he was going to sacriﬁce until the spear came out
under its shoulder.”
142 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

‘Umar ibn ʿAbd al-‘Aziz once sacriﬁced a camel during a ḥajj or an
‘umra.
143 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Ja‘far al-Qarī that

ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Ayyāsh ibn Abī Rabi‘a al-Makhzūmī sacriﬁced two
camels, one of them a Bactrian.
290

ʿ

144 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “If a she-camel that is being driven as a sacriﬁcial
animal gives birth, the oﬀspring should be carried along as well and
they are sacriﬁced together with her, and if there is no place where
they can be carried, they should be carried on the mother until they
are all sacriﬁced.”
145 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father said, “If necessary, ride on your sacriﬁcial animal, without
burdening it, and, if necessary, drink its milk after its young one has
drunk its ﬁll, and when you sacriﬁce it, sacriﬁce the young one with
it.”

20.46 Treatment of sacriﬁcial animals while being driven to
sacriﬁce
146 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar that, when he brought an animal to be sacriﬁced from
Madīna, he would garland it and brand it at Dhū al-Ḥulayfa, doing
the garlanding before the branding, but doing both in the same
place, while facing the qibla. He would garland the animal with two
sandals and brand it on its left side. It would then be driven with
him until he observed the standing along with everybody at ‘Arafa.
en he would drive it on with him when everybody else moved on,
and then when he arrived at Mina on the morning on the sacriﬁce,
he would sacriﬁce the animal before he shaved his head. He would
sacriﬁce the animals with his own hands, lining them up standing
and facing the qibla. He would then eat some of the meat, and give
some of it away.
147 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, when nicking the hump of his sacriﬁcial animal to
brand it, “In the name of Allah, and Allah is greater.”

148 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “A sacriﬁcial animal is what has been garlanded,
branded, and stood with on ‘Arafa.”
291

ʿ

149 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to drape his sacriﬁcial animals in ﬁne Egyptian linen,
saddlecloths and sets of clothing, which he would afterwards send
to the Ka‘ba and have the Ka‘ba draped with them.
150 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he asked ʿAbdullāh ibn

Dīnār what ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to do with the drapings of his
animals when the Ka‘ba began to be draped with the kiswa, and he
said, “He gave them away as ṣadaqa.”
151 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, about sacriﬁcial animals, “Six year-old camels,
three-year old cows and sheep, or older than these.”
152 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar never used to tear the drapes of his sacriﬁcial animals, and he
would not drape them until he went from Minā to ‘Arafa.
153 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father used to say to his sons, “My sons, let none of you sacriﬁce
any animal which he would be ashamed to sacriﬁce for a noble
woman, for surely Allah is the noblest of noble ones, and the most
deserving of those for whom things are chosen.”

20.47 Injury to sacriﬁcial animals or their loss
154 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that the man who was in charge of the sacriﬁcial animal of
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Messenger of Allah, what should I
do with a sacriﬁcial animal that gets injured?” e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him, “Slaughter any sacriﬁcial animal that is
injured. en throw the garlands in its blood, and then give the
people a free hand in eating it.”
155 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab said, “If someone dedicates an animal voluntarily and
then it is injured and he kills it and gives everyone a free hand in
292

eating it, he owes nothing. If, however, he eats some of it himself, or
tells certain other people to eat it, then he owes compensation.”
156 Yaḥyā related the same as that to me from Mālik from awr

ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās.

157 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “If

someone dedicates an animal as compensation, or for a vow, or as
the sacriﬁce for Ḥajj at-tamattu‘, and misfortune befalls it on the
road, he must provide a substitute.”
158 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “If someone dedicates an animal and then it goes astray
or dies, he should provide a substitute, if it was for a vow. If,
however, it was voluntary, then he can either provide a substitute for
it or not, as he wishes.”
159 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard the people of

knowledge say, “Someone who dedicates a sacriﬁcial animal for
compensation or as part of the ḥajj should not eat from it.”

20.48 e animal to be sacriﬁced on account of intercourse in
iḥrām
160 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar

ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and Abū Hurayra were asked
about a man who had intercourse with his wife while he was in
iḥrām on ḥajj. ey said, “e two of them should carry on and
complete their ḥajj. en they must perform ḥajj again the following
year, and sacriﬁce an animal.”
Mālik added that ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib said, “When they then go into
iḥrām for ḥajj in the following year they should keep apart until they
have completed their ḥajj.”
161 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab asking a group of people, “What do
you think about someone who has intercourse with his wife while he
293

is in iḥrām?” and none of them answered him. Sa‘īd said, “ere is a
man who has had intercourse with his wife while in iḥrām who has
sent a message to Madīna asking about it.” Some of them said,
“ey should be kept apart until the following year,” and Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab said, “ey should carry on and complete the ḥajj
which they have spoiled, and then return home when they have
ﬁnished. When the following ḥajj comes, they must perform ḥajj
and sacriﬁce an animal. ey should go into iḥrām for the ḥajj that
they have spoiled, and they should keep apart until they have
ﬁnished their ḥajj.”
Mālik said, “ey should both sacriﬁce an animal.”
Mālik said about a man who had intercourse with his wife during
ḥajj after he had come back from ‘Arafa but before he had stoned
the Jamra, “He must sacriﬁce an animal and perform ḥajj again the
following year. If, however, he had intercourse with his wife after he
stoned the Jamra, he only has to do an ‘umra and sacriﬁce an animal
and he does not have to perform another ḥajj.”
Mālik explained, “What spoils a ḥajj or an ‘umra, and makes
sacriﬁcing an animal and repeating the ḥajj necessary, is the meeting
of the two circumcised parts, even if there is no emission. It is also
made necessary by an emission if it is the result of bodily contact. I
do not think that a man who remembers something and has an
emission owes anything.”
Mālik said, “And if a man were to kiss his wife and no emission
were to occur from that, he would only have to sacriﬁce an animal.”
Mālik said, “A woman in iḥrām who has intercourse with her
husband several times during ḥajj or ‘umra out of obedience to him
only has to perform another ḥajj and sacriﬁce an animal. at is if
her husband has intercourse with her while she is performing ḥajj. If
he has intercourse with her while she is performing ‘umra, she must
repeat the ‘umra she has spoiled and sacriﬁce an animal.”



294

20.49 e animal to be sacriﬁced on account of missing the ḥajj
162 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that

Sulaymān ibn Yasār told him that Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī once set oﬀ
to perform ḥajj and then, when he reached an-Nāziya on the road to
Makka, his riding beasts strayed. He reached ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
on the Day of Sacriﬁce and told him what had happened and ‘Umar
said, “Do what someone performing ‘umra would do, and then you
can leave iḥrām, and then when the ḥajj next comes upon you, do it
and sacriﬁce whatever animal is easy for you.”
163 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from Sulaymān ibn Yasār that

Habbār ibn al-Aswad arrived on the Day of Sacriﬁce while ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb was sacriﬁcing his animal and said, “Amīr alMu’minīn, we made a mistake in our reckoning and we thought that
today was the day of ‘Arafa.” ‘Umar said, “Go to Makka, you and
whoever else is with you, and do ṭawāf and sacriﬁce your animal if
you have one with you, then shave or cut your hair and return home.
en, in another year, perform ḥajj and sacriﬁce an animal, and if
you cannot ﬁnd one, fast three days on ḥajj and seven when you
return home.”
Mālik said, “Someone who intends to perform ḥajj and ‘umra
together (Ḥajj al-Qirān) and then misses the ḥajj must perform ḥajj
again in another year, doing Ḥajj al-Qirān and oﬀer two sacriﬁcial
animals, one for doing Ḥajj al-Qirān, and one for the hajj that he
has missed.”

20.50 Intercourse before the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa
164 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Abī Rabāḥ that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās was asked about
a man who had had intercourse with his wife while at Minā before
he had done the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa, and he told him to sacriﬁce an
animal.

295

165 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī

that ‘Ikrima, the mawlā of Ibn ‘Abbās, said, (and awr believed it
to be from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās), “Someone who has intercourse
with his wife before he has done the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa should perform
an ‘umra and sacriﬁce an animal.”
166 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard Rabi‘a ibn

Abī ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān saying the same about that as what ‘Ikrima
related from Ibn ‘Abbās.

Mālik said, “at is what I like most out of what I have heard about
the matter.”
Mālik was asked about a man who forgot the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa until he
had left Makka and returned to his country and he said, “I think
that he should go back and do the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa as long as he has
not had sexual relations with women. If, however, he has had sexual
relations with women, then he should not only return and do the
Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa but he should also perform an ‘umra and sacriﬁce an
animal. He should not buy the animal in Makka and sacriﬁce it
there, but if he has not brought one with him from wherever it was
he set out to do ‘umra, he should buy one in Makka and then take it
outside the limits of the Ḥaram and drive it from there to Makka
and sacriﬁce it there.”

20.51 e sacriﬁcial animals considered least diﬃcult
167 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad

from his father that ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib used to say, “e least diﬃcult
thing acceptable as a sacriﬁcial animal is a sheep.”
168 Yaḥyā

related to me from Mālik that he had heard that
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās used to say, “e least diﬃcult thing
acceptable as a sacriﬁcial animal is a sheep.”
Mālik said, “at is what I like most out of what I have heard about
the matter, because Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says in His
Book, ‘O you who believe, do not kill game while you are in iḥrām.
296

If one of you kills any deliberately, the reprisal for it is a livestock
animal equivalent to what he killed, as judged by two just men
among you, a sacriﬁce to reach the Ka’ba, or expiation by feeding
the poor, or fasting commensurate to that,’ (5:95) and a sheep is one
of the animals which is judged to be acceptable as a sacriﬁce. Allah
has called it a sacriﬁcial animal, and there is no dispute among us
about the matter. How, indeed, could anyone be in doubt about the
matter? A sheep is the kaﬀāra for anything which does not reach the
extent of something for which a camel or a cow would be the
kaﬀāra, and the kaﬀāra for something which does not reach the
extent of something for which a sheep would be the kaﬀāra is
fasting, or feeding poor people.”
169 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “e least thing that is acceptable as a sacriﬁcial
animal is a camel or a cow.”

170 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

that a mawlā of ‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān called Ruqayya told
him that she once set out with ‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥman to go to
Makka. She said, “‘Amra entered Makka on the eighth of Dhū alḤijja, and I was with her. She did ṭawāf of the House, and sa‘y
between Ṣafā and Marwa, and then entered the back of the mosque.
She asked me, ‘Do you have a pair of scissors with you?’ and I
answered, ‘No.’ She said, ‘en try and ﬁnd some for me.’ I went
and looked for some and brought them back and she cut some hair
from the tresses of her head. en, on the Day of Sacriﬁce, she
slaughtered a sheep.”

20.52 Sacriﬁcial animals in general
171 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṣadaqa ibn Yasār al-

Makkī that a man from the people of Yemen, who had his hair
braided came to ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar and said, “Abū ʿAbd arRaḥmān, I have come to perform ‘umra on its own.” ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar said to him, “If I had been with you or you had asked me, I
would have told you to perform ḥajj and ‘umra together.” e
ʿ
297

Yemenī answered, “en that is what I am doing,” and ʿAbdullāh
ibn ‘Umar said to him, “Cut oﬀ the locks that are hanging from
your head and oﬀer a sacriﬁcial animal.” A woman from Iraq asked,
“What should his sacriﬁcial animal be, Abū ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān?” and
he replied, “His sacriﬁcial animal.” She asked him again, “What
should his sacriﬁcial animal be?” ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar replied, “If I
could only ﬁnd a sheep to sacriﬁce, I would prefer to do that than to
fast.”
172 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “A woman in iḥrām should not comb her hair
when she leaves iḥrām until she has cut oﬀ some tresses from her
hair, and if she has an animal for sacriﬁce with her she should not
cut oﬀ any of her hair until the animal has been killed.”
173 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard one of the

people of knowledge say, “A man and wife should not share in one
sacriﬁcial animal. Each should sacriﬁce an animal separately.”
Mālik was asked about whether someone who had been entrusted
with an animal for him to sacriﬁce on ḥajj, who then went into
iḥrām for ‘umra, should sacriﬁce it when he came out of iḥrām or
postpone it so that he sacriﬁced it at the time of the ḥajj, having in
the meantime come out of iḥrām from his ‘umra. He said, “He
should postpone it so that he may sacriﬁce it at the time of the ḥajj,
and meanwhile come out of iḥrām from his ‘umra.”
Mālik said, “If it is judged that someone must oﬀer an animal for
having killed game, or for any other reason, this animal can only be
sacriﬁced at Makka, since Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says, ‘...a
sacriﬁce to reach the Ka‘ba.’ e fasting or ṣadaqa that is considered
equivalent to oﬀering a sacriﬁce can be done outside Makka, and
the person who is doing it can do it wherever he likes.”
174 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Ya‘qūb ibn Khālid al-Makhzūmī that Abū Asmā’, the mawlā of
ʿAbdullāh ibn Ja‘far, told him that he was with ʿAbdullāh ibn Ja‘far
298

when they set out once from Madīna. At as-Suqyā they passed by
Husayn ibn ‘Alī, who was ill at the time. ʿAbdullāh ibn Ja‘far stayed
with him and then, when he feared that he was late (for the ḥajj), he
left and sent for ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and Asmā’ bint ‘Umays in
Madīna, and they came to Ḥusayn. en Ḥusayn pointed to his
head, and ‘Alī told someone to shave his head. en he sacriﬁced an
animal for him at as-Suqyā, killing a camel for him.
Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd added, “Ḥusayn had set out with ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān
on that particular journey to Makka.”

20.53 e wuqūf (standing) at ‘Arafa and Muzdalifa
175 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e whole of ‘Arafa is a standing-

place, except the middle of ‘Urana, and the whole of Muzdalifa is a
standing-place, except for the middle of Muḥassir.”
176 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

ʿAbdullāh ibn az-Zubayr used to say, “Know that the whole of
‘Arafa is a standing-place except for the middle of ‘Urana, and that
the whole of Muzdalifa is a standing-place except for the middle of
Muḥassir.”

Mālik said, “Allah, the Blessed and Exalted says, ‘ere is to be no
rafath, no fusūq and no jidāl during the ḥajj.’” (2:197).
He added, “Rafath is sexual relations with women, and Allah knows
best. Allah, the Blessed and Exalted says, ‘Rafath with your women
is permitted to you on the night of the fast.’ (2:197). Fusūq are
sacriﬁces made to idols, and Allah knows best. Allah, the Blessed
and Exalted, says, ‘Or a ﬁsq oﬀered up to other than Allah.’ (6:145)
Jidāl (arguing) during the ḥajj refers to when the Quraysh used to
stand near the Mash‘ar al-Harām at Quzaḥ in Muzdalifa, while the
Arabs and others would stand at ‘Arafa, and they would argue about
who was the more correct.

299

Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, says, “We have appointed for every
nation a rite that they observe. So let them not dispute with you
about the matter. Call the people to your Lord. You are guided
straight.” (22:67) is is what jidāl refers to in our opinion, and
Allah knows best. I have heard this from the people of knowledge.”

20.54 Wuqūf while not in wuḍū’, and wuqūf on a riding beast
177 Mālik was asked about whether a man could stand at ‘Arafa, or

at Muzdalifa, or stone the Jamras, or do sa‘y between Ṣafā and
Marwa if he was not in wuḍū’, and he said, “Every practice in the
ḥajj that a menstruating woman can take part in can be taken part in
by a man who is not in wuḍū’, and there is nothing due from him
for that. However, it is better for him to be in wuḍū’ for all those
things, and he should make a general practice of it.”
Mālik was asked whether a man who was riding should get down to
do the standing at ‘Arafa, or if he could do the standing while
mounted, and he said, “He can do the standing (wuqūf) while
mounted, unless he or his riding beast has an illness, in which case
Allah is the one who most often accepts an excuse.”

20.55 e wuqūf at ‘Arafa of someone who misses the ḥajj
178 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “Someone who does not stand at ‘Arafa on the
night of Muzdalifa before the dawn breaks has missed the ḥajj, and
someone who stands at ‘Arafa on the night of Muzdalifa before the
dawn breaks has caught the ḥajj.”
179 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father said, “Someone who does not stand at ‘Arafa on the night
of Muzdalifa before the dawn breaks has missed the ḥajj, and
someone who stands at ‘Arafa on the night of Muzdalifa before the
dawn breaks has caught the ḥajj.”
300

Mālik said about a slave freed during the wuqūf at ‘Arafa, “His
standing does not fulﬁl for him the ḥajj of Islam, except if he was
not in iḥrām and then he went into iḥrām after he was freed and he
stood at ‘Arafa that same night before the dawn broke – in which
case that is enough for him. If, however, he did not go into iḥrām
until after the dawn had broken, he is in the same position as
someone who misses the ḥajj by not catching the standing at ‘Arafa
before the breaking of the dawn on the night of Muzdalifa, and he
will have to perform the ḥajj of Islam later.”

20.56 Sending women and children ahead
180 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Sālim and

‘Ubaydullāh, two sons of ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar, that their father
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to send his family and children from
Muzdalifa to Minā ahead of him so that they could pray Ṣubḥ at
Mina and throw the stones before everyone (else) arrived.
181 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Atā’

ibn Abī Rabāḥ that a mawlā of Asmā’ bint Abī Bakr told him, “We
arrived at Minā with Asmā’ bint Abī Bakr at the end of the night,
and I said to her, ‘We have arrived at Minā at the end of the night,’
and she said, ‘We used to do that with one who was better than
you.’”
182 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Ṭalḥa

ibn ‘Ubaydullāh used to send his family and children from
Muzdalifa to Minā ahead of him.
183 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard one of the

people of knowledge disapproving of stoning the jamra until after
dawn on the Day of Sacriﬁce, as it was lawful for whoever had
thrown the stones to sacriﬁce.
184 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

Fāṭima bint al-Mundhir told him that she used to see Asmā’ bint
Abī Bakr at Muzdalifa telling whoever led the Ṣubḥ prayer for her
301

and her companions to pray it as soon as the dawn broke, after
which she would mount and go to Mina without stopping at all.

20.57 Going from ‘Arafa to Muzdalifa
185 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father said, “I was sitting with Usāma ibn Zayd when someone
asked him, ‘How did the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬travel when he
went from ‘Arafa to Muzdalifa during the Farewell Ḥajj?’ and he
replied, ‘He went at a medium pace, but when he found a gap (in
the crowds) he sped up.’”
186 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to spur on his mount in the middle of Muḥassir over the
distance of a stone’s throw.

20.58 Sacriﬁcing during the ḥajj
187 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬once said at Minā, “is is the place of

sacriﬁce, and the whole of Minā is a place of sacriﬁce”, and he said
on ‘umra, “is is the place of sacriﬁce,” meaning Marwa, “and all
the pathways of Makka and its roads are a place of sacriﬁce.”
188 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that

‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān told him that she had heard ‘Ā’isha,
Umm al-Mu’minīn, saying, “We set out with the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬when there were ﬁve nights left in Dhū al-Qa‘da and we
assumed that we must be setting out for ḥajj. When we got near to
Makka, the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told everyone that did not have a
sacriﬁcial animal with them to leave iḥrām after they had done ṭawāf
of the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa.”
‘Ā’isha added, “We were sent some beef on the Day of Sacriﬁce. I
asked what it was and they said that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had
sacriﬁced for his wives.”

302

Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “I mentioned this ḥadīth to Qāsim ibn
Muḥammad and he said, ‘She has given you the complete ḥadīth, by
Allah.’”
189 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar that Ḥafṣa, Umm al-Mu’minīn, once said to the Messnger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “Why is it that everyone has left iḥrām and you still have
not left iḥrām from your ‘umra?” and he replied, “I have gummed
my hair and garlanded my sacriﬁcial animal and will not leave iḥrām
until I have sacriﬁced the animal.”

20.59 How to make the sacriﬁce
190 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad

from his father from ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬killed some of his sacriﬁcial animals himself, and someone else
killed the rest.
191 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “Someone who vows to sacriﬁce a camel or a cow to
Allah should garland it with two sandals about its neck, and brand it
by causing blood to ﬂow from its side. He should then sacriﬁce it
either at the House or at Minā on the Day of Sacriﬁce. ere are no
other correct places apart from those. However, someone who vows
to slaughter a camel or a cow simply as a sacriﬁce can sacriﬁce it
wherever he wishes.”
192 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father used to kill his sacriﬁcial animals while they were
standing.

Mālik said, “No one is permitted to shave his head until he has
killed his sacriﬁcial animal, and no one must sacriﬁce before dawn
on the Day of Sacriﬁce. e things that should be done on the Day
of Sacriﬁce are slaughtering, donning clothes, grooming the body
generally (at-tafath) and shaving the head, and none of this may be
done before the Day of Sacriﬁce.”
303

20.60 Shaving the head
193 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “O Allah, have mercy

on those who shave their hair.” ey said, “And those who shorten
(their hair), Messenger of Allah.” He said, “O Allah, have mercy on
those who shave.” ey said, “And those who shorten it, Messenger
of Allah.” He said, “And those who shorten it.”
194 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim that his father used to go into Makka by night when he was
doing ‘umra and do ṭawāf of the House and sa‘y between Ṣafā and
Marwa and delay the shaving until the morning, but he would not
go back to the House and do ṭawāf again until he had shaved his
head.
ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān added, “Sometimes he would enter the mosque
and do the witr prayer there without actually going near the House.”

Mālik said, “At-tafath is shaving the head, putting on normal
clothes and things of that nature.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether a man who forgot to shave
(his head) at Minā during the ḥajj could shave in Makka, and he
said, “at is permissible, but I prefer the shaving to be done at
Mina.”
Mālik said, “What we are all agreed upon here (in Madīna) is that
no-one should shave his head or cut his hair until he has killed his
sacriﬁcial animal, if he has one, and things that are unlawful for him
do not become lawful for him until he leaves iḥrām at Minā on the
Day of Sacriﬁce. is is because Allah, the Blessed and Exalted,
says, ‘But do not shave your heads until the sacriﬁcial animal has
reached the place of sacriﬁce.’ (2:196)”

20.61 Cutting the Hair

304

ʿ

195 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that if ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar had ﬁnished the fast of Ramaḍān and intended to do ḥajj, he
would not cut his hair or beard at all until he had performed ḥajj.
Mālik said, “It is not necessary for people to do the same.”
196 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullah ibn

‘Umar used to trim his beard and moustache when he shaved at the
end of a ḥajj or ‘umra.
197 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ʿAbd ar-

Raḥmān that a man came to Qāsim ibn Muḥammad and said, “I did
the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa along with my wife, and then I went oﬀ onto a
mountain path and approached my wife to make love to her, and she
said, ‘I have not cut my hair yet.’ So I bit some of her hair oﬀ with
my teeth and then had intercourse with her.” Qāsim laughed and
said, “Tell her to cut her hair with some scissors.”
Mālik said, “To my liking, an animal should be sacriﬁced in an
instance such as this, because ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said, ‘Whoever
forgets any of his rites on ḥajj should sacriﬁce an animal.’”
198 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar once met a relative of his called al-Mujabbar who had done
the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa but, out of ignorance, had not shaved his head or
cut his hair. ʿAbdullah told him to go back and shave his head or cut
his hair, and then go back and do the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa.
199 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that when

Sālim ibn ʿAbdullāh intended to go into iḥrām he would call for
some scissors and trim his moustache and beard before setting oﬀ
and before going into iḥrām.

20.62 Gumming the hair
200 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Someone who puts plaits in
305

his hair should shave his head, and do not plait your hair in a such a
way that it seems you have gummed it.”
201 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Anyone who has
braided his hair, or plaited it, or gummed it must shave his head.”

20.63 Performing the prayer in the House, shortening the prayer,
and hastening the khuṭba at ‘Arafa
202 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬entered the Ka‘ba with

Usāma ibn Zayd, Bilāl ibn Rabāḥ and ‘Uthmān ibn Ṭalha al-Ḥajabī
and locked it behind him and stayed there for some time.

ʿAbdullāh said that he asked Bilāl, when he came out, what the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had done there and he said, “He positioned
himself with one support to his left, two supports to his right, and
three behind him (the house had six supports at that time) and then
he prayed.”
203 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sālim ibn

ʿAbdullāh said, “ʿAbd al-Mālik ibn Marwān wrote to al-Ḥajjāj ibn
Yūsuf telling him not to disagree with my father, ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar, about anything to do with the ḥajj. en, when the day of
‘Arafa came, ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar went to him just after noon, and I
went with him. He called out to him outside his tent, ‘Where is this
man?’ and al-Hajjāj came out to him, wearing a blanket dyed with
saﬄower and said to him, ‘What is it, Abū ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān?’ He
replied, ‘Hurry up if you want to follow the sunna.’ Al-Ḥajjāj said,
‘At this hour?’ and he answered, ‘Yes.’ Al-Ḥajjāj said, ‘Wait until I
have poured some water over myself and then I will come out.’ So
ʿAbdullāh dismounted and waited until al-Ḥajjāj came out. He
passed between me and my father and I said to him, ‘If you want to
follow the sunna today, then make the khuṭba short, do not delay
the prayer and perform the prayer quickly.’ Al-Ḥajjāj looked at my
father, ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar, to see if he would say the same thing,
ʿ

306

and when ʿAbdullāh saw that, he said, ‘What Sālim is saying is
true.’”

20.64 Performing the prayer at Minā on the eighth day of Dhū
al-Ḥijja, and the jumu‘a at Minā and ‘Arafa
204 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to pray Ẓuhr, ‘Aṣr, Maghrib, ‘Ishā’ and Ṣubḥ at Minā.
en in the morning, after the sun had risen, he would go to ‘Arafa.
Mālik said, “What we are all agreed upon here (in Madīna) is that
the imām does not recite the Qur’ān out loud in Ẓuhr on the Day of
‘Arafa, and that he gives a khuṭba to the people on that day, and that
the prayer on the day of ‘Arafa is really a Ẓuhr prayer, and even if it
coincides with a jumu‘a it is still a Ẓuhr prayer, but one which has
been shortened because of travelling.”
Mālik said that the imām of the pilgrims should not pray the jumu‘a
prayer if the Day of ‘Arafa, the Day of Sacriﬁce, or one of the three
days after the Day of Sacriﬁce, was a Friday.

20.65 Performing the prayer at Muzdalifa
205 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim

ibn ʿAbdullāh from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed Maghrib and ‘Ishā’ together at Muzdalifa.
206 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Mūsā ibn ‘Uqba that

Kurayb, the mawlā of Ibn ‘Abbās, heard Usāma ibn Zayd say, “ e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬left ‘Arafa and then, when he reached ashShi‘b, he dismounted and urinated and then did wuḍū’, though not
thoroughly. I said to him, ‘It is time for the prayer, Messenger of
Allah,’ and he answered, ‘e prayer is ahead of you,’ and then
mounted. When we arrived at Muzdalifa he dismounted and did
wuḍū’ thoroughly. en the iqāma was said for the prayer and he
prayed Maghrib. After that everyone settled his camel in its restingplace, and then the iqāma for ‘Ishā’ was said and he prayed it,
without having prayed anything between the two.”
307

207 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Adī

ibn ābit al-Anṣārī that ʿAbdullāh ibn Yazīd al-Khaṭmī told him
that Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī told him that he prayed Maghrib and
‘Ishā’ together at Muzdalifa during the Farewell Ḥajj, with the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.

208 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to pray Maghrib and ‘Ishā’ together at Muzdalifa.

20.66 Performing the prayer at Minā
209 Mālik said that the people of Makka who are performing the

ḥajj should shorten the prayer to two rak‘as when at Minā until they
go back to Makka.
210 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬prayed four rak‘a prayers

with only two rak‘as when at Minā, and that Abū Bakr prayed them
at Minā with only two rak‘as, and that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb prayed
them at Minā with only two rak‘as, and that ‘Uthmān prayed them
at Minā with only two rak‘as for half of his caliphate, and then in
the latter part completed them.
211 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb prayed two rak‘as with
everybody when he arrived in Makka. en, when he had ﬁnished,
he said, “People of Makka, complete your prayer, because we are a
group of travellers.” Later, ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb prayed two rak‘as
with them at Minā, but we have not heard that he said anything to
them on that occasion.
212 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from his

father that Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb prayed two rak‘as with the people
of Makka, and then, when he had ﬁnished, he said, “People of
Makka, complete your prayer, because we are a group of travellers.”
Later, ‘Umar prayed two rak‘as with them at Mina, but we have not
heard that he said anything to them on that occasion.
308

Mālik was asked whether the people of Makka should pray two
rak‘as at ‘Arafa or four, and whether the amīr of the ḥajj, if he was a
Makkan, should pray Ẓuhr and ‘Aṣr with four rak‘as or two, and also
how the people of Makka who were living (at Minā) should pray,
and he said, “e people of Makka should pray only two rak‘as at
‘Arafa and Minā for as long as they stay there, and should shorten
the prayer until they return to Makka. e amīr of the ḥajj, if he is a
Makkan, should also shorten the prayer at ‘Arafa and during the
days of Minā. Anyone who is living at Mina as a resident should do
the full prayer at Minā, and similarly anyone who lives at ‘Arafa and
is a resident there should do the full prayer at ‘Arafa.”

20.67 e prayer of a visitor to Makka or Minā
213 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “Someone who comes to

Makka at or before the new moon of Dhū al-Ḥijja and goes into
iḥrām for the ḥajj should do the full prayer until he leaves Makka for
Minā, and then he should shorten the prayer. is is because he has
decided to stay there for more than four nights.”

20.68 Saying the takbīr during the Days of Tashrīq
214 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

had heard that on the day after the Day of Sacriﬁce ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb went out a little after the sun had risen and said the takbīr,
and everyone repeated it after him. en he went out a second time
the same day when the sun was well up and said the takbīr, and
everyone repeated it after him. en he went out a third time after
midday and said the takbīr, and everyone repeated it after him until
it resounded from group to group until it reached the House and
people knew that ‘Umar had left to throw the stones.
Mālik said, “What we do here (in Madīna) is to say the takbīr
during the Days of Tashrīq after each prayer. e ﬁrst time is when
the imām and everyone with him says the takbīr after the Ẓuhr
prayer on the Day of Sacriﬁce, and the last is when the imām and

309

everyone with him says the takbīr after Ṣubḥ on the last of the Days
of Tashrīq, after which he stops saying the takbīr.”
Mālik said, “e takbīrs during the Days of Tashrīq should be
performed by both men and women, whether they are in a group or
by themselves, at Minā or anywhere else, and all of the them are
obligatory. In this everyone follows the imām of the ḥajj and the
people at Minā, because when everyone returns (to Makka) and
comes out of iḥrām they keep the same people as imāms while out
of iḥrām (as they did when they were in iḥrām). Someone who is
not performing ḥajj does not follow them except for the takbīrs
during the Days of Tashrīq.”
Mālik said, “e ‘designated days’ (2:203) are the Days of Tashrīq.”

20.69 Performing the prayer at al-Mu‘arras and al-Muḥaṣṣab
215 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬made his camel kneel down

at al-Baṭḥā’, which is at Dhū al-Ḥulayfa, and prayed there.
Nāﬁ‘ said, “ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to do that.”

Mālik said, “No one should go past al-Mu’arras, when he is
returning from ḥajj, without praying there. If he passes it at a time
when prayer is not permissible he should stay there until prayer is
permissible and then pray whatever he feels is appropriate. (is is)
because I have heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stopped there
to rest, and that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar stopped his camel there also.”
216 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullah ibn

‘Umar used to pray Ẓuhr, ‘Aṣr, Maghrib and ‘Ishā’ at al-Muḥaṣṣab,
and then enter Makka at night and do ṭawāf of the House.

20.70 Staying overnight at Makka on the nights of Minā

310

217 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Nāﬁ‘ said, “ey say that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to send men out to bring people in from
beyond al-‘Aqaba.”

218 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullah ibn

‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “No one performing ḥajj
should spend the nights of Minā beyond al-‘Aqaba.”

219 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father said, talking about spending the nights of Minā at Makka:
“No one should spend the night anywhere except Minā.”

20.71 Stoning the jamras
220 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar

ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to stop at the ﬁrst two jamras for such a long
time that someone standing up would get tired.
221 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to stop for a long time at the ﬁrst two jamras saying,
“Allah is greater”, “Glory be to Allah”, “Praise be to Allah”, and
making du‘ā’s to Allah, but he did not stop at the Jamrat al-‘Aqaba.
222 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say “Allah is greater” whenever he threw a pebble
while stoning the jamra.

223 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard some of the

people of knowledge saying, “e pebbles used for stoning the
jamras should be like the stones used as slingshot.”
Mālik said, “I like it better if they are a little larger than that.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar used to say, “Someone who is at Minā when the sun sets in
the middle of the Days of Tashrīq must not leave until he has
stoned the jamras on the following day.”

311

ʿ

224 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn

Qāsim from his father that when people went to stone the jamras
they would walk both going there and coming back. e ﬁrst one to
ride was Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān.

225 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he asked ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān

ibn Qāsim, “From where did Qasim stone the Jamrat al-‘Aqaba?”
and he replied, “From wherever it was possible.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether someone else could throw
the stones for a child or a sick man and he said, “Yes, and a sick man
should inquire as to when the stones will be thrown for him and
then say the takbīr while he is in the place where he is staying, and
make a sacriﬁce. If a sick man regains his health during the Days of
Tashrīq, he should stone whatever stoning has been done for him
and he should sacriﬁce an animal.”
Mālik said, “I do not consider that someone who stones the jamras
or does sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa without being in wuḍū’ has to
repeat anything, but he should not do so deliberately.”
226 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to say, “e jamras should not be stoned during the
three days until after the sun has passed the meridian.”

20.72 Indulgence with respect to stoning the jamras
227 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

ibn Ḥazm from his father that Abū al-Baddāḥ ibn ‘Āṣim ibn ‘Adī
told him from his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬allowed the
camel-herders to spend the night outside of Minā, and they threw
the stones (once) on the Day of Sacriﬁce, and (once) for the
following day and the day after that, and (once) on the day when
they left Minā.
228 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard ‘Aṭā’

ibn Abī Rabāḥ mentioning that the camel-herders were allowed to
312

throw the stones at night, and saying that this was in the early
period (of Islam).
Mālik said, “e explanation of the ḥadīth in which the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬allowed the camel-herders to delay the stoning of the
jamras is, in our view, and Allah knows best, that they threw stones
on the Day of Sacriﬁce, and then threw again two days later, which
was the ﬁrst possible day for leaving, and this throwing was for the
day which had passed. ey then threw again for the day itself,
because it is only possible for someone to make up for something
which is obligatory for him, and when something obligatory passes
someone by (without him doing it) he must necessarily make it up
afterwards (and not beforehand). So (in the case of the camelherders), if it seemed appropriate for them to leave that day, they
would have done all that they were supposed to do, and if they were
to stay until the following day, they would throw stones with
everybody else on the second and last day for leaving, and then
leave.”
229 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Bakr ibn Nāﬁ‘ from

his father that the daughter of one of Ṣaﬁyya bint Abī ‘Ubayd’s
brothers was bleeding after she had given birth to a child at
Muzdalifa. She and Saﬁyya were delayed and did not arrive at Minā
until after the sun had set on the Day of Sacriﬁce. ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar told them both to stone the jamra at the time they arrived
and he did not think that they owed anything.
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked about someone who forgot to stone
one of the jamras on one of the days of Minā until it was evening
and he said, “He should throw the stones at whatever time of day or
night he remembers, just as he would pray the prayer if he forgot it
and then remembered it at any time of day or night. If he
remembers (that he has not done the stoning) after he has returned
to Makka, or after he has left, he must sacriﬁce an animal.”



313

20.73 e Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa
230 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ and ʿAbdullāh ibn

Dīnār from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb gave a
khuṭba to the people at ‘Arafa and taught them the conduct of the
ḥajj, and one of the things he said to them in his speech was,
“When you get to Minā and have stoned the jamra, then whatever
is unlawful for someone performing the ḥajj becomes lawful, except
women and scent. No one should touch women or scent until he has
done ṭawāf of the House.”
231 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ and ʿAbdullāh ibn

Dīnār from ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said,
“When someone has stoned the jamra and shaved his head or
shortened some of his hair and sacriﬁced an animal, whatever was
unlawful for him becomes lawful, except women and scent, (which
remain lawful for him) until he has done ṭawāf of the House.”

20.74 A menstruating woman’s entering Makka
232 Yaḥyā related to me from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Qāsim, from

his father that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, said, “We set out with
the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, in the year of the Farewell Ḥajj and we
went into iḥrām for ‘umra. Afterwards, the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘Whoever has a sacriﬁcial animal with him should go into
iḥrām for Ḥajj al-Qirān, and he should not leave iḥrām without
leaving iḥrām for both of them at the same time.’”
She continued, “I was menstruating when I got to Makka, so I did
not do ṭawāf of the House or sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa. I
complained to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he said, ‘Undo your
hair and comb it and leave the ‘umra and go back into iḥrām for the
ḥajj.’”
She said, “I did so, and when we had completed the ḥajj, the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent me with ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī Bakr

314

as-Ṣiddīq to at-Tan‘īm and I performed an ‘umra and he said, ‘is
is in place of your ‘umra.’”
“ose who had entered iḥrām for the ‘umra did ṭawāf of the House
and sa‘y between Ṣafā and Marwa, then left iḥrām. en they did
another ṭawāf after returning from Minā for their ḥajj, whereas
those who entered iḥrām for the ḥajj or combined the ḥajj and the
‘umra, only did one ṭawāf.”
Yaḥyā related the same as that to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb
from ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr from ‘Ā’isha.
233 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim from his father that ‘Ā’isha said, “I came to Makka at the
time of my period so I did not do ṭawāf of the House or go between
Ṣafā and Marwa. I complained to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he
said, ‘Do what the people performing ḥajj do except do not do ṭawāf
of the House and go between Ṣafā and Marwa until you are pure.’”
Mālik said, concerning a woman who entered iḥrām for ‘umra at the
time of ḥajj, and she arrived in Makka during her period and so
could not do ṭawāf of the House, “When she fears that the time (for
ḥajj) is getting close, she gets into iḥrām for the ḥajj and sacriﬁces an
animal. She is like someone who combines the ḥajj and the ‘umra.
One ṭawāf is enough for her. If a woman starts her period after she
has already done ṭawāf of the House and prayed, she does sa‘y
between Safā and Marwa and stops at ‘Arafa and Muzdalifa and
stones the jamras but she does not do the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa until she is
pure and has ﬁnished her menses.”

20.75 e Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa of a menstruating woman
234 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim from his father from ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, that Ṣaﬁyya
bint Ḥuyayy began menstruating and so she mentioned it to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, and he asked, “Will she delay us?” and he

315

was told, “She has already done the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa,” and he said,
“en she will not delay us.”
235 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

ibn Ḥazm from his father from ‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that
‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, said to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬,
“Messenger of Allah, Ṣaﬁyya bint Ḥuyayy has begun her period,”
and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Perhaps she will delay us. Has
she done ṭawāf of the House with you?” ey said, “Of course.” He
said, “So you are free to leave.”
236 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū ar-Rijāl Muḥammad

ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān from ‘Amra bint ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān that when
‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, was performing ḥajj with women who
were expecting their periods, she would hurry them to do the Ṭawāf
al-Ifāḍa on the Day of Sacriﬁce. If they started to menstruate after
the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa she did not stop for them but left with them
while they were menstruating.
237 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father from ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬mentioned Ṣaﬁyya bint Ḥuyayy and he was told that she
had started her period. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Perhaps
she will delay us.” ey said, “Messenger of Allah, she has done
ṭawāf,” and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “en she will not delay
us.”
Mālik said that Hishām said that ‘Urwa said that ‘Ā’isha said, “We
can remember, so why would people get their women to do the
ṭawāf early if it wasn’t of beneﬁt to them? If it were as they say, more
than six thousand menstruating women would still be in Minā in
the morning, all of them having already done the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa.’”
238 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

from his father that Abū Salama ibn ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān told him that
Umm Sulaym bint Milḥān asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬for
advice one time when she had begun menstruating, or had given
316

birth to a child, after she had done Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa on the Day of
Sacriﬁce. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave her permission to leave.
Mālik said, “A woman menstruating at Minā stays until she has
done ṭawāf of the House. ere is no escape from that for her. If she
has already done the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa and she starts to menstruate
afterwards, she may leave for her country, since permission for
menstruating women to leave has been transmitted to us from the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.”
He added, “If a woman starts her period at Minā before she does
the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa, and the period lasts longer than usual, she has to
stay longer than the time that bleeding would usually detain
women.”

20.76 e compensation (ﬁdya) for killing birds and wild animals
while in iḥrām
239 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb gave the judgement of a ram for a hyena, a
female goat for a gazelle, a she-goat less than one year old for a hare,
and a four month old kid for a jerboa.
240 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd al-Mālik ibn Qurayr

from Muḥammad ibn Sīrīn that a man came to ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb and said, “I was racing a friend on horseback towards a
narrow mountain trail and we killed a gazelle accidentally and we
were in iḥrām. What is your opinion?” ‘Umar said to a man by his
side, “Come, so that you and I may make an assessment.” ey
decided on a female goat for him, and the man turned away saying,
“is Amīr al-Mu’minīn cannot even make an assessment in the
case of a gazelle until he calls a man to decide with him.” ‘Umar
overheard the man’s words and called him and asked him, “Do you
recite Sūrat al-Mā’ida?” and he answered, “No.” He said, “en do
you recognize this man who has taken the decision with me?” and
he answered, “No.” He said, “If you had told me that you did recite
Sūrat al-Mā’ida, I would have dealt you a blow.” en he said,
317

“Allah the Blessed, the Exalted says in His Book, ‘as judged by two
just men among you, a sacriﬁce to reach the Ka‘ba’ (5:95), and this is
ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf.”
241 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that

his father used to say, “For an oryx a cow is given and for the female
of gazelles a sheep.”
242 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab used to say, “For a pigeon killed in Makka a sheep
is due.”
Mālik said, speaking about if a man of the people of Makka were to
enter iḥrām for ḥajj or ‘umra and there were some Makkan nestlings
in his house and they were shut in and died, “I think that he should
pay for that with a sheep for each bird.”
243 Mālik said, “I still hear that when a person in iḥrām kills an

ostrich, a camel is due.”

Mālik said, “I think that for an ostrich egg, one-tenth of the price of
a camel is due in the same way that one pays the price of a slave,
either male or female, for the unborn child of a free woman. e
value of the slave is ﬁfty dinars, and that is one-tenth of what the
blood-money, (in compensation) for the mother would be.
Mālik said, “In the case of birds of prey, eagles or falcons or vultures
count as game for which a price is paid just as a price is paid for any
game which a person in iḥrām kills.”
Mālik said, “For everything for which a penalty is paid, the
assessment is the same, whether the animal is old or young. e
analogy of that is that the blood-money for the young and the old
freeman are considered to be the same.”

20.77 e ﬁdya for killing locusts in iḥrām

318

244 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that a

man came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and said, “Amīr al-Mu’minīn, I
killed some locusts with my whip when I was in iḥrām,” and ‘Umar
said to him, “Give a handful of food.”
245 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that a

man came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and asked him about some
locusts he had killed while he was in iḥrām. ‘Umar said to Ka‘b,
“Come, let us make an assessment.” Ka‘b said, “A dirham,” and
‘Umar said to Ka‘b, “You can ﬁnd dirhams. A date is better than a
locust.”

20.78 e ﬁdya for shaving the head before sacriﬁcing
246 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbd al-Karīm ibn Mālik

al-Jazarī from ʿAbd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī Laylā from Ka‘b ibn ‘Ujra
that one time he was with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in iḥrām, and
he was suﬀering from lice on his head. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬,
told him to shave his head, saying, “Fast three days, or feed six poor
people, two mudds for each person, or sacriﬁce a sheep. If you do
any of those it will be enough for you.”
247 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd bin Qays from

Mujāhid Abū al-Ḥajjāj from Ibn Abī Laylā from Ka‘b ibn ‘Ujra that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him, “Perhaps your lice are
troubling you?” He replied that indeed they were, and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Shave your head and fast three days or
feed six poor men or sacriﬁce a sheep.”
248 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ‘Aṭā’ ibn ʿAbdullāh al-

Khurasānī said that an old man from Sūq al-Buram in Kufa had
related to him that Ka‘b ibn ‘Ujra said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
came to me while I was blowing under a cooking pot belonging to
my companions and my head and beard were full of lice. He took
my forehead and said, ‘Shave your hair and fast three days or feed
319

six poor people.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was aware that I did
not have anything with me to sacriﬁce.’”
Mālik said, concerning paying compensation (ﬁdya) for the relief of
physical discomfort, “e custom concerning it is that no one pays
compensation until he has done something which makes it
obligatory to pay compensation just as making amends (kaﬀāra) is
only done when it has become obligatory for the one who owes it.
e person can pay the compensation wherever he wishes, regardless
of whether he has to sacriﬁce an animal or fast or give ṣadaqa – in
Makka or in any other town.”
Mālik said, “It is not correct for a person in ihrām to pluck out any
of his hair or to shave it or cut it until he has left ihrām, unless he is
suﬀering from an ailment of the head, in which case he owes the
compensation Allah the Exalted has ordered. It is not correct for a
person in ihrām to cut his nails, or to kill his lice, or to remove them
from his head or from his skin or his garment to the ground. If a
person in ihrām removes lice from his skin or his garment, he must
give away the quantity of food that he can scoop up with both
hands.”
Mālik said, “Anyone who, while in ihrām, plucks out hairs from his
nose or armpit or rubs his body with a depilatory agent or shaves the
hair from around a head wound out of necessity or shaves his neck
for the place of the cupping glasses, regardless of whether it is in
forgetfulness or in ignorance, owes compensation in all these
instances, and he must not shave the place of the cupping glasses.
Someone, who, out of ignorance, shaves his head before he stones
the jamra, must also pay compensation.”

20.79 Forgetfulness in the rituals
249 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ayyūb ibn Abī Tamīma

as-Sakhtayānī from Sa‘īd ibn Jubayr that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said,
“If someone forgets anything of the rituals or omits them
intentionally, he must slaughter an animal.”
320

Ayyūb added “I do not know if he said ‘omits’ or ‘forgets’.”
Mālik said, “If it is a sacriﬁcial animal that has to be slaughtered, it
may only be done in Makka, but if it is a sacriﬁce, it may be
slaughtered wherever the one who owes the sacriﬁce prefers.”

20.80 Compensation (ﬁdya) in general
250 Mālik said concerning someone who wishes to wear clothes that

a person in iḥrām must not wear, or cut his hair, or touch perfume
without necessity, because he ﬁnds it easy to pay the compensation:
“No one must do such things. ey are only allowed in cases of
necessity, and compensation is owed by whoever does them.”

Mālik was asked whether the culprit could choose for himself the
method of compensation he made, and he was asked what kind of
animal was to be sacriﬁced, and how much food was to be given,
and how many days were to be fasted, and whether the person could
delay any of these, or if they had to be done immediately. He
answered, “Whenever there are alternatives in the Book of Allah for
the kaﬀāra, the culprit can choose to do whichever of the
alternatives he prefers. e sacriﬁce is a sheep. Fasting is fasting for
three days. Feeding consists of feeding six poor men: two mudds for
every poor man, measured by the ﬁrst mudd, the mudd of the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬.”
Mālik said, “I have heard one of the people of knowledge saying,
‘When a person in iḥrām throws something and hits game
unintentionally and kills it, he must pay compensation. In the same
way, someone outside the Ḥaram who throws anything into the
Ḥaram and hits game he did not intend to and kills it, has to pay
compensation because the intentional and the accidental are in the
same position in this matter.’”
Mālik said concerning people who kill game together while they are
in iḥrām or in the Ḥaram, “I think that each one of them owes a full
share. If a sacriﬁcial animal is decided for them, each one of them
321

owes one, and if fasting is decided for them, the full fasting is owed
by each one of them. e analogy of that is a group of people who
kill a man by mistake and the kaﬀāra for that is that each person
among them must free a slave or fast two consecutive months.”
Mālik said, “Anyone who throws something at game or hunts it
after stoning the jamra and shaving his head but before he has
performed the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa owes compensation for that game,
because Allah the Blessed, the Exalted said, ‘And when you leave
iḥrām, then hunt,’ and restrictions still remain for someone who has
not done the Ṭawāf al-Ifāḍa about touching perfume and women.”
Mālik said, “Someone in iḥrām does not owe anything for plants he
cuts down in the Ḥaram and it has not reached us that anyone has
given a decision of anything for it, but what he has done is bad!”
Mālik said concerning someone who was ignorant of, or who forgot
the fast of three days in the ḥajj, or who was ill during them and so
did not fast them until he had returned to his community, “He must
oﬀer a sacriﬁcial animal (hady) if he can ﬁnd one and if not he must
fast the three days among his people and the remaining seven after
that.”

20.81 e ḥajj in general
251 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Īsā ibn

Ṭalha that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ said, “e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stopped for the people at Minā, and they questioned him.
A man came and said to him, ‘Messenger of Allah, I was unclear
about what to do and I shaved before sacriﬁcing,’ and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Sacriﬁce, and there is no harm.’ en
another came to him and said, ‘Messenger of Allah, I was unclear
about what to do and I sacriﬁced before throwing the stones.’ He
advised, ‘row, and there is no harm.”

‘Amr continued, saying that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was not
asked about anything that should be done before or after it without
322

his saying, “Do it, and there is no harm.”
252 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ʿAbdullāh ibn
‘Umar that when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬returned from a

military expedition or a ḥajj or an ‘umra, he used to say three takbīrs
on every elevated part of the land, and then he used to say, “ere is
no god but Allah, alone, without partner. To Him belongs the
Kingdom and to Him belongs the praise and He has power over
everything. Returning, repenting serving, prostrating, praising our
Lord. Allah has promised truly and given His slave victory and
defeated the tribes alone.”

Lā ilāha illa’llāhu waḥdahu lā sharīka lah. Lahu’l-mulku wa lahu’lḥamd wa huwa ‘alā kulli shay’in qadīr. Ā’ibūna tā’ibūna ‘ābidūna
sājidūna li rabbinā ḥāmidun. Ṣadaqa’llāhu wa‘dahu wa naṣara
‘abddahu wa hazama’al-aḥzāba waḥdah.
253 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibrāhīm ibn ‘Uqba from

Kurayb the mawlā of ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās from Ibn ‘Abbās that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬passed a woman in a litter and it was said to
her, “is is the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬,” and she took the forearms
of a young boy who was with her and asked, “Does this one have a
ḥajj, Messenger of Allah?” and he replied, “Yes, and you have a
reward.”
254 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibrāhīm ibn Abī ‘Abla

from Ṭalḥa ibn ‘Ubaydullāh ibn Kurayz that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Shaytān is not considered more abased or more cast out or
more contemptible or more angry on any day than on the Day of
‘Arafa. at is only because he sees the descent of the Mercy and the
fact that Allah overlooks great wrong actions. at is except from
what he was shown on the Day of Badr.” Someone asked, “What
was he shown on the Day of Badr, Messenger of Allah?” He replied,
“Did he not see Jibrīl arranging the ranks of the angels?”
255 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ziyād ibn Abī Ziyād the

mawlā of ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Ayyāsh ibn Abī Rabi‘a from Talha ibn
323

‘Ubaydullāh ibn Kurayz that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e
most excellent du‘ā’ is the du‘ā’ on the Day of ‘Arafa, and the best of
what I and the Prophets before me have said, is ‘ere is no god but
Allah, alone, without partner.’”
Lā ilāha illa’llāhu waḥdahu lā sharīka lah.
256 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Anas ibn
Mālik that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬entered Makka in the Year of

Victory wearing a helmet, and when he took it oﬀ a man came to
him and said, “Messenger of Allah, Ibn Khaṭtal is clinging to the
covers of the Ka‘ba”, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Kill
him.”
Mālik commented, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was not in iḥrām at
the time, and Allah knows best.”
257 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ʿAbdullāh ibn

‘Umar was coming from Makka and when he was at Qudayd, news
came to him from Madīna and he returned and entered Makka
without iḥrām.
Yaḥyā related the same as that to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb.
258 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn

Ḥalḥala ad-Dīlī from Muḥammad ibn ‘Imrān al-Anṣārī that his
father said that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar came upon him while he was
stopped for a rest under a tall tree on the road to Makka and he
said, “What has made you stop under this tall tree?” He replied that
he sought its shade. ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “Anything besides
that?” and he said, “No, that was the only reason I have stopped for
a rest,” and ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘If you are between al-Akhshabayn (which are two mountains)
near Minā, (indicating the east with his outspread hand) you will
ﬁnd a valley called as-Surar with a tree in it beneath which the
umbilical cords of seventy Prophets have been cut.’”

324

ʿ

259 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ʿAbdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

ibn Ḥazm from Ibn Abī Mulayka that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb passed
a leprous woman doing ṭawāf of the House and he said to her,
“Slave of Allah, do not make people uncomfortable. Better that you
stay in your house,” so she did so. A man passed by her after that
and said to her, “e one who forbade you has died, so come out.”
She replied, “I am not going to obey him when he is alive and
disobey him when he is dead.”
260 Yaḥyā related

to me from Mālik that he had heard that
ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Abbās used to say that the area between the corner of
the Black Stone and the door of the Ka‘ba was called al-Multazam.
261 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard

Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān mentioning that a certain man
passed Abū Dharr at ar-Rabadha (which was about 30 miles from
Madīna) and Abū Dharr asked him, “Where are you heading to?”
and he replied, “I am intending to perform ḥajj.” Abū Dharr asked,
“Has anything else brought you out?” and on his saying, “No”, Abū
Dharr said, “Resume what you are doing whole-heartedly.”
e man related, “I went on till I came to Makka and I stayed as
long as Allah willed. Suddenly, one time, I was with a crowd of
people thronging about a man and I pushed through the people to
him and it was the old man that I had come across at ar-Rabadha.
When he saw me, he recognized me and said, ‘Ah, you have done
what I told you.’”
262 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he asked Ibn Shihāb about

making a condition in the ḥajj that one could leave iḥrām at any
place where an obstacle befell one and he said, “Does anyone do
that?” and disapproved of it.

Mālik was asked whether a man could cut plants from the Ḥaram
for his mount, and he said, “No.”

20.82 e ḥajj of a woman without a maḥram
325

263 Mālik said concerning a woman who had never been on ḥajj, “If

she does not have a maḥram who can go with her, or if she has one
but he cannot go with her, she does not abandon the obligation of
the ḥajj which Allah has imposed on her. Let her go in a group of
women.”

20.83 Fasting in Ḥajj at-Tamattu‘
264 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa

ibn az-Zubayr that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, used to say,
“Someone performing Ḥajj at-Tamattu‘ who does not have a
sacriﬁcial animal fasts (three days) from the time he enters iḥrām for
the ḥajj till the Day of ‘Arafa, and if he does not fast then, he fasts
the days of Minā.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn
ʿAbdullāh that ʿAbdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to say the same
concerning that as the words of ‘Ā’isha j.

326

21. Jihād
21.1 Stimulation of desire for jihād
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Someone

who does jihād in the way of Allah is like someone who fasts and
prays constantly and does not slacken from his prayer and fasting
until he returns.”

2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Allah

guarantees either the Garden or a safe return to his home with
whatever he has obtained of reward or booty for the one who does
jihād in His way, if it is solely jihād and trust in His promise that
brings him out of his house.”

3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from Abū

Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Horses are a reward for one man, a protection for another,
a burden for another. e one for whom they are a reward is the one
who dedicates them for use in the Way of Allah, and tethers them
in a meadow or grassland. Whatever the horse enjoys of the
grassland or meadow in the length of its tether are good deeds for
him. If it breaks its tether and goes over a hillock or two, its tracks
and droppings are good deeds for him. If it crosses a river and
drinks from it while he did not mean to allow it to drink it, that
counts as good deeds for him, and the horse is a reward for him.
Another man uses his horse to gain self reliance and to be able to
refrain from asking for support from other people and does not
forget Allah’s right on their necks and backs. Horses are a protection
for him. Another man uses them out of pride to show them oﬀ and
in hostility to the people of Islam. ey are a burden for that man.”

327

e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was asked about donkeys, and he said,
“Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this single allinclusive āyat, ‘Whoever does an atom of good will see it, and
whoever does an atom of evil will see it’ (99:7-8).
4 Yaḥyā related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn

Ma‘mar al-Anṣārī that ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār said that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “Shall I tell you who has the best degree among people? A
man who takes the rein of his horse to do jihād in the way of Allah.
Shall I tell you who has the best degree among people after him? A
man who lives alone with a few sheep, performs the prayer, pays the
zakāt, and worships Allah without associating anything with Him.”
5 Yaḥyā

related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said,
“‘Ubayda ibn al-Walīd ibn ‘Ubāda ibn aṣ-Ṣāmit informed me from
his father that his grandfather (‘Ubāda) said, ‘We made a contract
with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬to hear and obey in ease and
hardship, enthusiasm and reluctance, and not to dispute with people
in authority and to speak or establish the truth wherever we were
without worrying about criticism.’”
YA 6 ḥyā related to me from Mālik that Zayd ibn Aslam had said
that ‘Ubayda ibn al-Jarrāḥ had written to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
mentioning to him a great array of Byzantine troops and the anxiety
they were causing him. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb wrote in reply to him,
“Whatever hardship befalls a believing slave, Allah will make an
opening for him after it, and a hardship will not overcome two
eases. Allah the Exalted says in His Book, ‘O you who believe! Be
steadfast; be supreme in steadfastness; be ﬁrm on the battleﬁeld; and
show fear of Allah – so that perhaps you will be successful’ (3:200).”

21.2 Prohibition against travelling with the Qur’ān in enemy
territory
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade travelling with a

328

Qur’ān in the land of the enemy. Mālik commented, “at is out of
fear that the enemy will get hold of it.”

21.3 e prohibition against killing women and children in
military expeditions
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that a son of
Ka‘b ibn Mālik (Mālik ibn Ka‘b) said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

forbade those who fought Ibn Abī Ḥuqayq (a treacherous Jew from
Madīna) to kill women and children. He said that one of the men
ﬁghting reported that the wife of Ibn Abī Ḥuqayq began screaming
and he repeatedly raised his sword against her. en he would
remember the prohibition of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬so he would
stop. Had it not been for that, we would have been rid of her.”
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Ibn ‘Umar that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬saw the corpse of a woman who had

been slain in one of the expeditions and he disapproved of it and
forbade the killing of women and children.

10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Abū

Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq was sending armies to Syria. He went for a walk
with Yazīd ibn Abī Sufyān who was the commander of one of the
battalions. It is claimed that Yazīd asked Abū Bakr, “Will you ride
or shall I get down?” Abū Bakr replied, “I will not ride and you will
not get down. I intend these steps of mine to be in the way of
Allah.” en Abū Bakr advised Yazīd, “You will ﬁnd a people who
claim to have totally given themselves to Allah. Leave them to what
they claim to have given themselves. You will ﬁnd a people who
have shaved the middle of their heads, strike what they have shaved
with the sword.
“I give you ten orders. Do not kill women or children or an aged,
inﬁrm person. Do not cut down fruit-bearing trees. Do not destroy
an inhabited place. Do not slaughter sheep or camels except for
food. Do not burn bees and do not scatter them. Do not steal from
the booty. And do not be cowardly.”
329

11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

‘Abd al-‘Azīz wrote to one of his governors, “It has been passed
down to us that when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent out a raiding
party, he would say to them, ‘Make your raids in the name of Allah
in the Way of Allah. Fight whoever denies Allah. Do not steal from
the booty and do not act treacherously. Do not the mutilate and do
not kill children.’ Say the same to your armies and raiding parties,
Allah willing. Peace be upon you.”

21.4 Fulﬁlling safe conduct
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from a man of Kufa that ‘Umar

ibn al-Khaṭṭāb wrote to a commander of an army which he had sent
out, “I have heard that it is the habit of some of your men to chase
an unbeliever till he takes refuge in a high place. en one man tells
him in Persian not to be afraid, and when he comes up to him, he
kills him. By Him in whose hand my self is, if I knew someone who
had done that, I would strike oﬀ his head.”
Yaḥyā said, I heard Mālik say, “is tradition is not unanimously
agreed upon, so it is not acted upon.”
Mālik, when asked whether safe conduct promised by a gesture had
the same status as that promised by speech, said, ‘Yes, I think that
one can request an army not to kill someone by gesturing for safe
conduct, because as far as I am concerned, gesture has the same
status as speech. I have heard that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said, ‘ere
is no people who betray a pledge, but that Allah gives their enemies
power over them.’”

21.5 Giving in the Way of Allah
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that when ‘Abdullāh

ibn ‘Umar gave something in the Way of Allah, he would say to its
owner, “When you reach Wādi al-Qurā (on the outskirts of
Madīna) then it is your aﬀair.”

330

14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab used to say, “When a man is given something for a
military expedition, and he brings it to the battleﬁeld, it is his.”

Mālik was asked about a man who pledged himself to go on a
military campaign, equipped himself, and when he wanted to go
out, one or both of his parents forbade him to go. He said, “He
should not contradict them. Let him put it oﬀ for another year. As
for the equipment, I think that he should store it until he needs it. If
he fears that it will spoil, let him sell it and keep its price so that he
can readily buy what is needed for a military expedition. If he is
well-to-do, he will ﬁnd the like of his equipment when he goes out,
so let him do what he likes with his equipment.”

21.6 Booty from war in general
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent a raiding party which

included ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar near Najd. ey plundered many
camels and their portions were twelve or eleven camels each. ey
divided it up camel by camel.
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, “When people in military
expeditions divided the spoils, they made a camel equal to ten
sheep.”
Mālik said about the paid labourer in military expeditions, “If he is
present at the battle and is with the people in the battle and he is a
free man, he has his share. If he is not present, he has no share.”
Mālik summed up, “I think that the booty is only divided among
free men who have been present at the battle.”

21.7 ings on which the tax of one-ﬁfth (khums) is not
obligatory

331

Mālik said about enemy soldiers who were found on the seashore of
a Muslim land and claimed that they were merchants and that the
sea had driven them ashore, while the Muslims were not able to
verify any of that nor that their ships had been damaged, or they
were thirsty and had disembarked without the permission of the
Muslims, “I think that it is up to the ruler to give his opinion about
them, and I do not think that the tax of one-ﬁfth is taken from
them.”

21.8 What it is permissible for the Muslims to eat before the
spoils are divided
Mālik said, “I do not see that there is any harm in the Muslims
eating whatever food they come across in enemy territory before the
spoils are divided.”
Mālik said, “I think that any camels, cattle and sheep (taken as
booty) are considered as food which the Muslims can eat in enemy
territory. If they could not be eaten until the people had gathered for
the divisions and the spoils had been distributed among them, that
would be harmful for the army. I do not see any objection to eating
such things within acceptable limits. I do not think, however, that
anyone should store up any of it to take back to his family.”
Mālik was asked whether it was proper for a man who had obtained
food in enemy territory and had eaten some of it and stocked up
some of it as provision and some of it was left over – was it correct
for him to keep it and then eat it with his family, or to sell before he
had come to his country and make use of its price? He said, “If he
sells it while he is on a military expedition, I think that he should
put its price into the booty of the Muslims. If he takes it back to his
country, I see no objection to his eating it and using it if it is a small
amount.”

21.9 Returning enemy plunder to the owner before the division
of the spoils

332

17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that it reached him that a slave

of ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar escaped and one of his horses wandered oﬀ,
and the idolaters seized them. en the Muslims re-captured them,
and they were returned to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar, before the division
of the spoils took place.
I heard Mālik say about Muslim property that had been seized by
the enemy, “If it is noticed before the distribution, then it is
returned to its owner. Whatever has already been distributed is not
returned to anyone.”
Mālik, when asked about a man whose young male slave was taken
by the idolaters and then the Muslims re-captured him, said, “e
owner is more entitled to him without having to pay his price or
value or having to incur any loss before the distribution takes place.
If the distribution has already taken place, then I think that the slave
belongs to his master for his price if the master wants him back.”
Regarding an umm walad of a Muslim man who has been taken by
the idol-worshippers and then re-captured by the Muslims and
allotted in the distribution of spoils and then recognised by her
master after the distribution. Mālik said, “She is not to be enslaved.
I think that the ruler should pay a ransom for her for her master. If
he does not do it, then her master must pay a ransom for her and
not leave her. I do not think that she should be made a slave by
whoever takes her nor is it lawful for him to have intercourse with
her. She is in the position of a free woman because her master
would be required to pay compensation if she injured somebody and
so she is in the same position (as a wife). He should not leave an
umm walad of his to be made a slave and intercourse with her to be
made lawful.”
Mālik was asked about a man who went to enemy territory to pay
ransom or to trade, and he brought a free man or a slave, or they
were given to him. He said, “As for the free man, the price he buys
him for is a debt against the man and he is not made a slave. If the
captive is given to him freely, he is free and owes nothing unless the
333

man gave something in recompense for him. at is a debt against
the free man, the same as if a ransom had been paid for him. As for
a slave, his former master can choose to take him back and pay his
price to the man who brought him or he can choose to leave him, as
he wishes. If he was given to the man, the former master is more
entitled to him, and he does nothing for him unless the man gave
something for him in recompense. Whatever he gave for him is a
loss against the master if he wants him back.”

21.10 Stripping the slain of their personal eﬀects in the booty
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Amr

ibn Kathīr in Aﬂaḥ from Abū Muḥammad, the mawlā of Abū
Qatāda, that Abū Qatāda ibn Rib‘ī said, “We went out with the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in the year of Ḥunayn. When the armies
met, the Muslims were put in disarray. I saw a man from the
idolaters who had got the better of one of the Muslims, so I circled
round and came up behind him and struck him with a sword on his
shoulder-blade. He turned to me and grabbed me so hard that I felt
the smell of death in it. en death overcame him, and he let go of
me.”

He continued, “I met ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and asked him, “What
is going on with the people?’ He replied, ‘e Command of Allah.’
en the people returned from the battle and the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Whoever has killed one of the dead and can prove it,
can strip him of his personal eﬀects.’ I stood up and said, ‘Who will
testify for me?’ and then I sat down. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
repeated, ‘Whoever has killed one of the dead and can prove it, can
strip him of his personal eﬀects.’ I stood up and said, ‘Who will
testify for me?’ then I sat down. en he repeated his statement for
a third time, so I stood up, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘What is the matter with you, Abū Qatāda?’ So I related my story to
him. A man said, ‘He has spoken the truth, Messenger of Allah. I
have the eﬀects of that slain person with me, so give him
compensation for it, Messenger of Allah.’
334

Abū Bakr said, ‘No, by Allah! He did not intend that one of the
lions of Allah should ﬁght for Allah and His Messenger and then
give you his spoils.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘He has spoken
the truth, hand it over to him.’ He gave it to me, and I sold the
breast-plate and I bought a garden in the area of the Banū Salima
with the money. It was the ﬁrst property I had acquired since
becoming Muslim.”
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that al-Qāsim

ibn Muḥammad said that he had heard a man asking Ibn ‘Abbās
about booty. Ibn ‘Abbās said, “Horses are part of the booty and
personal eﬀects are as well.”
en the man repeated his question, and Ibn ‘Abbās repeated his
answer. en the man asked, “What are the spoils which He, the
Blessed, the Exalted, mentions in His Book?” He kept on asking
until Ibn ‘Abbās was on the verge of getting annoyed, then Ibn
‘Abbās said, “Do you know who this man is like? He is like Ibn
Ṣabīgh, who was beaten by ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb because he was
notorious for asking foolish questions.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether someone who killed one of
the enemy could keep the man’s eﬀects without the permission of
the ruler. He answered, “No one can do that without the permission
of the ruler. Only the ruler can exercise his discretion. I have not
heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ever said, ‘Whoever kills
someone can have his eﬀects’ on any other day than the day of
Ḥunayn.”

21.11 Awarding extra portions from the ﬁfth (khums)
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab said, “People used to be given extra portions from
the khums.”
Mālik said, “at is the best of what I have heard on the matter.”

335

Mālik was asked about extra portions and whether they were taken
from the ﬁrst of the spoils, and he said, “at is only decided
according to the discretion (ijtihād) of the ruler. We do not have a
known reliable command about that other than it is up to the
discretion of the ruler. I have not heard that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬gave extra portions in all his raids. I have only heard that he gave
extra portions in one of them, namely the day of Ḥunayn. It
depends on the discretion of the ruler whether they are taken from
the ﬁrst of the spoils or what is after it.”

21.12 e share of the spoils allotted to cavalry in military
expeditions
21 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said that he had heard that ‘Umar

ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz used to say, “A man on horse-back has two shares,
and a man on foot has one.”
Mālik added, “I continue to hear the same.”

Mālik, when asked whether a man who was present with several
horses took a share for all of them, said, “I have never heard that. I
think that there is only a share for the horse on which he fought.”
Mālik said, “I think that working horses and half-breeds are
considered as horses because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in
His Book, ‘And horses, mules and donkeys both to ride and for
adornment.’ (16:8) He said, the Mighty, the Majestic, ‘Arm
yourselves against them with all the ﬁrepower and cavalry you can
muster, to terrify the enemies of Allah and your enemies.’ (8:60) I
think that working breeds and half-breeds are considered as horses if
the governor accepts them.”
Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab was asked about work-horses and whether
there was zakāt on them. He said, “Is there any zakāt on horses?”

21.13 Stealing from the spoils

336

22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Sa‘īd
from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb that when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came

back from Ḥunayn heading for al-Ji‘rāna, the people crowded
around so much to question him that his she-camel backed into a
tree, which became entangled in his cloak and pulled it oﬀ his back.
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Return my cloak to me. Are you
afraid that I will not distribute among you what Allah has given you
as spoils? By Him in whose hand my self is! Had Allah given you as
spoils as many camels as there are acacia trees in Tihāma, I would
have distributed it among you. You will not ﬁnd me to be miserly,
cowardly, or a liar.” en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬got down and
stood among the people, and said, “Hand over even the needle and
thread, for stealing from the spoils is disgrace, ﬁre, ignominy on the
Day of Rising for people who do it.”
en he took a bit of camel ﬂuﬀ or something from the ground and
said, “By Him in whose hand my self is! What Allah has made
spoils for you is not mine –- even the like of this! – except for the
tax of one-ﬁfth (khums), and the tax of one-ﬁfth is returned to
you.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān from Ibn Abī ‘Amra that Zayd
ibn Khālid al-Juhanī said, “A man died on the day of Hunayn, and
they mentioned him to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.” Zayd claimed
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “You pray over your
companion.” (i.e. he would not pray himself ). e people’s faces
dropped at that. Zayd claimed that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“Your companion stole from the spoils taken in the way of Allah.”
Zayd said, “So we opened up his baggage and found some Jews’
beads worth about two dirhams.”
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

‘Abdullāh ibn al-Mughīra ibn Abī Burda al-Kinānī that he had
heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came to the people in their
tribes and made supplication for them, but left out one of the tribes.
337

‘Abdullāh related, “e tribe found an onyx necklace stolen from the
booty in the saddle-bags of one of their men. e Messenger ‫ﷺ‬,
came to them, and then did the takbīr over them as one does the
takbīr over the dead.”
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī

from Abū al-Ghayth Sālim, the mawlā of Ibn Muṭī‘ that Abū
Hurayra said, “We went out with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in the
year of Khaybar. We did not capture any gold or silver except for
personal eﬀects, clothes, and household goods. Rifā‘a ibn Zayd gave
a black slave-boy called Mid‘am to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬made for Wādi al-Qurā. After he arrived
there, Mid‘am was struck and killed by a stray arrow while
unsaddling the camel of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. e people
said, ‘Good luck to him! e Garden!’
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘No! By Him in whose hand my
self is! e cloak which he took from the spoils on the Day of
Khaybar before they were distributed will blaze with ﬁre on him.’
When the people heard that, a man brought a sandal-strap – or two
sandal-straps – to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘A sandal-strap – or two sandal-straps – of ﬁre!’”
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he had

heard that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said, “Stealing from the spoils does
not appear in a people but that terror is cast into their hearts.
Fornication does not spread in a people but that there is much death
among them. A people do not lessen the measure and weight but
that provision is cut oﬀ from them. A people do not judge without
right but that blood spreads among them. A people do not betray
the pledge but that Allah gives their enemies power over them.”

21.14 Martyrs in the Way of Allah
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “By

Him in whose hand my self is! I would like to ﬁght in the way of
338

Allah and be killed, then brought to life again so I could be killed,
and then brought to life again so I could be killed.”
Abū Hurayra said three times, “I testify to it by Allah!”
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū’z-Zinād from al-A‘raj
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Allah

laughs over two men. One of them kills the other, but each of them
will enter the Garden; one ﬁghts in the way of Allah and is killed,
then Allah turns (in forgiveness) to the killer, so he ﬁghts (in the
way of Allah) and also becomes a martyr.”
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “By

Him in whose hand my self is! None of you is wounded in the way
of Allah – and Allah knows best who is wounded in His way – but
that when the Day of Rising comes, blood will gush forth from his
wound. It will be the colour of blood, but its scent will be that of
musk.”
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to say, “O Allah! Do not let me be slain
by the hand of a man who has prayed a single prostration to You
with which he will dispute with me before You on the Day of
Rising!”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd

al-Maqburī from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Qatāda that his father said that
a man came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said, “O Messenger
of Allah! If I am killed in the way of Allah, expecting the reward,
sincere, advancing, and not retreating, will Allah pardon my faults?”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬answered, “Yes.” When the man turned
away, the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬called him – or sent an order to
him and he was called to him. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to
him, “What did you say?” He repeated his words to him, and the
Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said to him, “Yes, except for debts. Jibrīl said that to
me.”
339

32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, that he had heard that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said over the martyrs of Uḥud, “I testify for them.” Abū
Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq said, “Messenger of Allah! Are we not their
brothers? We entered Islam as they entered Islam and we did jihād
as they did jihād.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Yes, but I do
not know what you will do after me.” Abū Bakr wept profusely and
said, “Are we really going to outlive you!”
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was sitting by a grave which was being dug

at Madīna. A man looked into the grave and said, ‘An awful bed for
the believer.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘What you have said
is awful.’

“e man said, ‘I did not mean that, Messenger of Allah. I meant
being killed in the way of Allah.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘Being killed in the way of Allah has no like! ere is no place on
the earth where I would prefer my grave to be than here (meaning
Madīna).’ He repeated it three times.”

21.15 ings in which martyrdom lies
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to say, “O Allah! I ask You for
martyrdom in Your way and death in the city of Your Messenger!”
35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Umar

ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “e nobility of the believer is his taqwā. His
dīn is his noble descent. His manliness is his good character.
Boldness and cowardice are but instincts which Allah places
wherever He wills. e coward shrinks from defending even his
father and mother, and the bold one ﬁghts for the sake of the
combat not for the spoils. Being slain is but one way of meeting

340

death, and the martyr is the one who gives himself, expectant of
reward from Allah.”

21.16 How to wash a martyr
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb was washed and shrouded and
prayed over, yet he was a martyr, may Allah have mercy on him.
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard the people of

knowledge say that martyrs in the way of Allah were not washed,
nor were any of them prayed over. ey were buried in the garments
in which they were slain.
Mālik said, “is is the sunna for someone who is killed on the
battleﬁeld and is not reached until he is already dead. Someone who
is carried oﬀ and lives for as long as Allah wills after it is washed
and prayed over as was ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb.”

21.17 What is disliked to be done with something given in the
Way of Allah
Y 38 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb in one year gave 40,000 camels as war-mounts.
Sometimes he would give one man a camel to himself. Sometimes
he would give one camel between two men to take them to Iraq. A
man from Iraq came to him and said, “Give me and Suḥaym a
mount.” ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb asked him, “I ask you by Allah, is
suḥaym a water-skin?” He answered, “Yes.”

21.18 Stimulation of desire for jihād
39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn

Abī Ṭalha that Anas ibn Mālik had said that when the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬arrived at Qubā’, he visited Umm Ḥarām bint Milḥan and
she fed him. Umm Ḥarām was the wife of ‘Ubāda ibn aṣ-Ṣāmit.
One day the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had called on her and she had
fed him, and sat down to delouse his hair. e Messenger of Allah
341

‫ ﷺ‬had dozed and woke up smiling. Umm Ḥarām said, “What is

making you smile, Messenger of Allah?” He said, “Some of my
community were presented to me, riding in the Way of Allah. ey
were riding in the middle of the sea, kings on thrones, or like kings
on thrones.” (Isḥāq was not sure). She said, “O Messenger of Allah!
Ask Allah to put me among them!” So he made a supplication for
her, and put his head down and slept. en he had woken up
smiling, and she said to him, “Messenger of Allah, why are you
smiling?” He said, “Some of my community were presented to me,
raiding in the way of Allah. ey were kings on thrones or like kings
on thrones,” as he had said the ﬁrst time. She said, “O Messenger of
Allah! Ask Allah to let me be among them!” He said, “You are
among the ﬁrst.”
Isḥāq added, “She travelled on the sea in the time of Mu‘āwiya, and
when she landed, she was thrown from her mount and killed.”
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Abū

Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān from Abā Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Had I not been concerned for my community, I would
have liked never to stay behind a raiding party going out in the way
of Allah. However, I do not have the means to carry them to it, nor
can they ﬁnd for themselves anything on which to ride out and it is
grievous for them to have to stay behind from me. I would like to
ﬁght in the way of Allah and then be killed, then brought back to
life so that I could be killed and then brought back to life so that I
could be killed.”
41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “On
the Day of Uḥud, the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Who will bring

me news of Sa‘īd ibn ar-Rabī‘ al-Anṣārī?’ A man said, ‘Me,
Messenger of Allah!’ So the man went around among the slain, and
Sa‘īd ibn ar-Rabī‘ said to him, ‘What are you doing?’ e man said
to him, ‘e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent me to bring him news of
you.’ He said, ‘Go to him, and give him my greetings, and tell him
that I have been stabbed twelve times, and am mortally wounded.
342

Tell your people that they will have no excuse with Allah if the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬is slain while one of them is still alive.’”
42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬encouraged people to do jihād and

mentioned the Garden. One of the Anṣār was eating some dates he
had in his hand, and said, “Am I so desirous of this world that I
should sit until I ﬁnish them?” He threw aside what was in his hand
and took his sword and fought until he was slain.
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

Mu‘ādh ibn Jabal said, “ere are two types of military expeditions.
ere is one military expedition in which valuables are spent, things
are made easy for a fellow, authorities are obeyed, and corruption is
avoided. at military expedition is all good. ere is a military
expedition in which valuables are not spent, things are not made
easy, the authorities are not obeyed, and corruption is not avoided.
e one who ﬁghts in that military expedition does not return with
any reward.”

21.19 Horses and racing them and ﬁnancing in military
expeditions
44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Blessing is in the

forelocks of horses until the Day of Rising.”

45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬held a race between horses

which had been made lean by training, from al-Ḥafyā’ to aniyyat
al-Wadā‘. He held a race between horses which had not been made
lean from the aniyya (a mountain pass near Madīna) to the
mosque of the Banū Zurayq. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar was among those
who raced them.
46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab say, “ere is no harm in placing stakes on horses
343

if a third horse enters the race. e winner takes the stake, and the
loser has no liability.”
47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was seen wiping the face of his horse with

his cloak. He was questioned about it and said, “I was reproached in
the night about horses,” i.e. not taking proper care of them.

48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd aṭ-Ṭawīl from
Anas ibn Mālik that when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬went out to

Khaybar, he arrived there at night, and when he came upon a people
by night, he did not attack until morning. In the morning, the Jews
came out with their spades and baskets. When they saw him, they
said, “Muḥammad! By Allah, Muḥammad and his army!” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Allah is greater! Khaybar is destroyed.
When we come to a people, it is an evil morning for those who have
been warned.”
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ḥumayd

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever hands over two of any type
of property in the way of Allah is called to the Garden, with the
words, ‘O slave of Allah! is is good!’ Whoever is among the
people of prayer, is called from the gate of prayer. Whoever is
among the people of jihād is called from the gate of jihād. Whoever
is among the people of ṣadaqa, is called from the gate of ṣadaqa.
Whoever is among the people of fasting, is called from the gate of
the well-watered (Bāb ar-Rayyān).”
Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq said, “Messenger of Allah! Is it absolutely
necessary that one be called from one of these gates? Can someone
be called from all of these gates?” He answered, “Yes, and I hope
you are among them.”

21.20 Acquisition of the land of dhimmīs who surrender

344

Mālik was asked whether he thought that when an imām had
accepted jizya from a people and they gave it, the land of any of
those who surrendered belonged to the Muslims. Mālik said, “at
varies. As for the people who make a treaty – those of them who
surrendered are entitled to their land and property. As for the people
of force who are taken by force – if one of them surrenders, his land
and property belong to the Muslims because the people of force
have been overcome in their towns, and so this becomes booty for
the Muslims. As for the people with a treaty, their property and lives
are protected by the treaty they made. Only the terms of the treaty
are demanded of them.”

21.21 Burial in one grave by necessity and Abū Bakr’s carrying
out the promise of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬after the death of
the Messenger ‫ﷺ‬
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī

Ṣa‘ṣa‘a that he had heard that ‘Amr ibn al-Jamūḥ al-Anṣārī and
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar al-Anṣārī, both of the tribe of Banū Salama,
had their grave uncovered by a ﬂood. eir grave was part of what
was left after the ﬂood. ey were in the same grave, having been
among those martyred at Uḥud. ey were dug up so that they
might be moved. ey were found unchanged. It was as if they had
only died the day before. One of them had been wounded, and he
had put his hand over his wound and had been buried like that. His
hand was pulled away from his wound and released, and it returned
to where it had been. It was forty-six years between Uḥud and the
day they were dug up.

Mālik said, “ere is no harm in burying two or three men in the
same grave due to necessity. e oldest one is put nearest to the
qibla.”
51 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān said, “Property was sent to Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq from
Bahrain. He said, ‘If someone had a promise or a pledge with the
345

Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, let him come to me.’ So Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh
came to him, and he gave him three cupped handfuls.”

346

22. Vows and Oaths
22.1 Fulﬁlling vows to walk
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from
‘Ubaydullāh ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Abbās that Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubāda asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬for an
opinion and said, “My mother died while she still had a vow which
she had not fulﬁlled.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Fulﬁl it for
her.”
1

2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr that

his paternal aunt related that her grandmother made a vow to walk
to the Qubā’ mosque. She died and did not fulﬁl it, so ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Abbās asked her daughter to walk on her behalf.

Yaḥyā said that he had heard Mālik say, “No one can walk for
anyone else.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Ḥabība

said, “I said to a man when I was young, ‘A man who only says that
he must walk to the House of Allah and does not say that he has
vowed to walk, does not have to walk.’
“A man said, ‘Shall I give you this small cucumber?’ and he had a
small cucumber in his hand, ‘if you will say, “I must walk to the
House of Allah?”’ I answered, ‘Yes,’ and I said it since at that time I
was still immature. en, when I came of age, someone told me that
I had to fulﬁl my vow. I went and asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab
about it, and he said to me, ‘You must walk.’ So I walked.”
Mālik said, “at is the custom among us.”

22.2 Making vows to walk to the House and not succeeding

347

4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ‘Urwa ibn ‘Udhayna al-

Laythī said, “I went out with my grandmother who had vowed to
walk to the House of Allah. When we had gone part of the way, she
could not go on. I sent one of her mawlās to question ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar and went with him. He asked ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar, and
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said to him, ‘Take her and let her ride, and
when she has the strength let her ride back, and start to walk from
the place from where she was unable to go on.’”
Yaḥyā said that he had heard Mālik say, “I think that she must
sacriﬁce an animal.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab and Abū Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān both said the same
as ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar.
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “I

vowed to walk, but I was struck by a pain in the kidney, so I rode
until I came to Makka. I questioned ‘Aṭā’ ibn Abī Rabāḥ and others,
and they said, ‘You must sacriﬁce an animal.’ When I came to
Madīna I questioned the scholars there, and they told me to walk
again from the place from which I was unable to go on. So I
walked.”
Yaḥyā said that he had heard Mālik say, “What is done among us
regarding someone who makes a vow to walk to the House of Allah,
and then cannot do it and so rides, is that he must return and walk
from the place from which he was unable to go on. If he cannot
walk, he should walk what he can and then ride, and he must
sacriﬁce a camel, a cow, or a sheep if that is all that he can manage.”
Mālik, when asked about a man who said to another, “I will carry
you to the House of Allah”, answered, “If he intended to carry him
on his shoulders, by which he means hardship and exhaustion to
himself, and does not have to do that, let him walk by foot after a
sacriﬁce. If he did not intend anything, let him ride to ḥajj, and take
the man with him. at is because he said, ‘I will carry you to the
348

House of Allah.’ If the man refuses to perform ḥajj with him, then
there is nothing against him, and what is demanded of him is
revoked.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether it is enough for a man
who has made a vow that he will walk to the House of Allah a
certain (large) number of times, or who has forbidden himself from
talking to his father and brother, if he does not fulﬁl a certain vow,
and he had taken upon himself, by the oath, something which he is
incapable of fulﬁlling in his lifetime, even though he were to try
every year, to fulﬁl only one or a (smaller) number of vows by Allah.
Mālik said, “e only satisfaction I know for that is fulﬁlling what
he has obliged himself to do. Let him walk for as long as he is able
and draw near Allah the Exalted by what he can of good.”

22.3 How to fulﬁl the oath of walking to the Ka‘ba
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that what he preferred of what he
had heard from the people of knowledge about a man or woman
who vowed to walk to the House of Allah, was that they fulﬁlled the
oath when performing ‘umra, by walking until they had done sa‘y
between Ṣafā and Marwa. When they had done sa‘y it was ﬁnished.
If they vowed to perform the ḥajj on foot, they walked until they
came to Makka, then they walked until they had ﬁnished all the
rites.
Mālik said, “Walking is only for ḥajj or ‘umra.”

22.4 Vows not permitted in disobedience to Allah
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from that Ḥumayd ibn Qays and

awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī both informed him that the Messenger of
Allah ‫( ﷺ‬and one of them gave more detail than the other), saw a
man standing in the sun. e Messenger asked, “What is wrong
with him?” e people said, “He has vowed not to speak or to seek
shade from the sun or to sit, and to fast.” e Messenger of Allah

349

‫ ﷺ‬said, “Go and tell him to speak, seek shade, and sit, but let him

complete his fast.”

Mālik said, “I have not heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
ordered the man in question to do any kaﬀāra. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬only ordered him to complete that in which there was
obedience to Allah and to abandon that in which there was
disobedience to Allah.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

heard al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad say, “A woman came to ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Abbās and said, ‘I have vowed to sacriﬁce my son.’ Ibn ‘Abbas
said, ‘Do not sacriﬁce your son. Do kaﬀāra for your oath.’ An old
man with Ibn ‘Abbās said, ‘What kaﬀāra is there for this?’ Ibn
‘Abbās said, ‘Allah the Exalted says, “ose of you who say,
regarding their wives. ‘Be as my mother’s back’” (58:2) and then He
went on to oblige the kaﬀāra for it as you have seen.’”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṭalḥa ibn Abī al-Mālik al-

Aylī from al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad ibn aṣ-Ṣiddīq from ‘Ā’isha that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If someone vows to obey Allah, let
him obey Him. If someone vows to disobey Allah, let him not
disobey Him.”
Yaḥyā said that he had heard Mālik say, “e meaning of the
statement of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, ‘If someone vows to disobey Allah, let
him not disobey Him’ is that, for instance, a man who vows that, if
he speaks to such-and-such a person, he will walk to Syria, Egypt,
ar-Rabadha, or any other such things which are not considered as
‘ibāda, is not under any obligation by any of that, even if he were to
speak to the man or to break whatever it was he swore, because
Allah does not demand obedience in such things. He should only
fulﬁl those things in which there is obedience to Allah.”

22.5 Inadvertence in oaths

350

9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his

father that ‘‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, said, “Inadvertence in oaths
is that a man says, ‘By Allah! No, by Allah!’” i.e. out of habit.
Mālik said, “e best of what I have heard on the matter is that an
inadvertent oath is when a man takes an oath on something which
he feels certain is like he said, only to ﬁnd that it is other than what
he said. is is inadvertance.”
Mālik said, “A binding oath is, for example, that a man says that he
will not sell his garment for ten dinars, and then he sells it for that,
or that he will beat his young slave and then does not beat him, and
so on. One owes kaﬀāra for making such an oath, but there is no
kaﬀāra for inadvertence.”
Mālik said, “If someone makes an oath about something, knowing
that he is acting wrongly, and he swears to a lie, when he knows it to
be a lie, in order to please someone with it or to excuse himself to
someone by it or to gain money by it, no kaﬀāra that he does for it
can cover it.”

22.6 Oaths for which kaﬀāra is not obligatory
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “If someone swears by Allah and then says, ‘Allah
willing’ and then does not do what he has sworn to, he has not
broken his oath.”
Mālik said, “e best I have heard on this reservation is that it
belongs to the statement made if the speaker does not break the
normal ﬂow of speech before he is silent. If he is silent and breaks
the ﬂow of speech, he has no such reservation.”
Yaḥyā said, “Mālik said that a man who said that he had disbelieved
or associated something with Allah and then broke his oath, owed
no kaﬀāra, and he was not a disbeliever or one who associated
something with Allah unless his heart concealed something of either
351

of those. He should ask forgiveness of Allah and not do that again –
but what he did was evil.”

22.7 Oaths for which kaﬀāra is obligatory
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Suhayl ibn Abī Ṣāliḥ from
his father from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“Whoever makes an oath and then sees that something else would
be better than it, should do kaﬀāra for his oath and do what is
better.”

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “Anyone who makes the form of
a vow and then does not mention anything speciﬁc is still obliged to
make the kaﬀāra for an oath (if he breaks it).”
Mālik says, “Emphasis is when a man swears one thing several
times, repeating the oath in his speech time after time. For instance,
the statement, ‘By Allah, I will not decrease it from such-and-such,’
sworn three times or more. e kaﬀāra of that is like the kaﬀāra of
one oath. If a man swears, ‘I will not eat this food or wear these
clothes or enter this house,’ that is all in one oath, and he is only
obliged to do one kaﬀāra. It is the same for a man who says to his
wife, ‘You are divorced if I let you wear this garment or let you go to
the mosque,’ and it is one entire statement in the normal pattern of
speech. If he breaks any of that oath, divorce is obliged, and there is
no breaking of oath after that in whatever he does. ere is only one
oath to be broken in that.”
Mālik said, “What we do about a woman who makes a vow without
her husband’s permission is that she is allowed to do so and she
must fulﬁl it if it only concerns her own person and will not harm
her husband. If, however, it will harm her husband, he may forbid
her to fulﬁl it, but it remains an obligation against her until she has
the opportunity to complete it.”

22.8 What is done regarding the kaﬀāra of a broken oath

352

12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “If someone breaks an oath which he has stressed, he
has to free a slave, or clothe ten poor people. If someone breaks an
oath, but has not stressed it, he only has to feed ten poor people and
each poor person is fed a mudd of wheat. Someone who does not
have the means for that should fast for three days.”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar used to do kaﬀāra for a broken oath by feeding ten poor
people. Each person got a mudd of wheat. He sometimes freed a
slave if he had repeated the oath.
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that
Sulaymān ibn Yasār said, “I understood from people that when they
made the kaﬀāra for a broken oath, they gave a mudd of wheat
according to the smaller mudd. ey thought that such would
compensate for them.”
Mālik said, “e best of what I have heard about the one who does
kaﬀāra for breaking his oath by clothing people is that, if he clothes
men, he clothes them each in one garment. If he clothes women, he
clothes them each in two garments, a long shift and a long scarf,
because that is what is satisfactory for each of them in the prayer.”

22.9 Oaths in general
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that one time the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was speaking to

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb while he was travelling in an expedition and
‘Umar swore by his father. He (the Messenger) said, “Allah forbids
you to swear by your fathers. If anyone swears, let him swear by
Allah or keep silent.”

15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to say, “No, by the Overturner of

hearts.”

353

16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Uthmān ibn Ḥafṣ ibn

‘Umar ibn Khalda that Ibn Shihāb had heard that Abū Lubāba ibn
‘Abd al-Mundhir, when Allah turned to him, said, “Messenger of
Allah, should I leave my people’s house in which I committed
wrong action and keep your company, and give away all my property
as ṣadaqa for Allah and His Messenger?” e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Giving away a third of it is enough for you.”
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ayyūb ibn Mūsā from

Manṣūr ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmān al-Ḥajabī from, his mother that
‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn j was asked about a man who devoted his
property to the door of the Ka‘ba. She said, “Let him do kaﬀāra for
it with the kaﬀāra of the oath.”
Mālik said that someone who devoted all his property in the way of
Allah, and then broke his oath, should put a third of his property in
the Way of Allah, as that was what the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did
in the case of Abū Lubāba.

354

23. Sacriﬁcial Animals
23.1 Animals avoided as sacriﬁces
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Amr ibn al-Ḥārith from

‘Ubayd ibn Fayrūz from al-Barā’ ibn ‘Āzib that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was asked what animals should be avoided as sacriﬁces. He
indicated with his hand and said, “Four:” – Al-Barā’ indicated with
his hand and said, “My hand is shorter than the hand of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.” – “A lame animal whose lameness is
evident, a one-eyed animal which is clearly one-eyed, an animal
which is clearly ill, and an emaciated animal with no fat on it.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar would guard against animals and camels which were young or
had physical defects as sacriﬁces.
Mālik said, “at is what I like best of what I have heard.”

23.2 Animals desirable as sacriﬁces
3 Yaḥyā

related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that one time
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar wanted to sacriﬁce an animal at Madīna. Nāﬁ‘
said, “He told me to buy him an excellent horned ram, then to
sacriﬁce it on the Day of Sacriﬁce in the people’s place of prayer.”
Nāﬁ‘ said, “So I did it, then it was carried to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar
who shaved his head when the ram had been sacriﬁced. He was ill,
and did not attend the ‘Īd with the people.”
Nāﬁ‘ added, “‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar used to say, ‘Shaving the head is
not obligatory for someone who sacriﬁces an animal.’ Ibn ‘Umar
would do so, however.”

23.3 Prohibition against sacriﬁcing an animal before the imām
ﬁnishes

355

4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Bushayr ibn Yasār that Abū Burda ibn Niyār sacriﬁced an animal
before the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sacriﬁced on the Day of Sacriﬁce.
He asserted that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered him to sacriﬁce
another animal, and he, Abū Burda, said, “What if I can only ﬁnd
an animal less than one year old, Messenger of Allah?” He had said,
“If you can only ﬁnd a young animal, then sacriﬁce it.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Abbād

ibn Tamīm that one time ‘Uwaymir ibn Ashqar sacriﬁced his animal
before the prayer on the morning of the Day of Sacriﬁce, and he
mentioned that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had ordered him to
sacriﬁce another animal.

23.4 Storing meat from sacriﬁcial animals
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī
from Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade

that the meat from sacriﬁcial animals be eaten after three days. en
later he said, “Eat, give ṣadaqa, provide for yourselves and store up.”

7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr that
‘Abdullāh ibn Wāqid said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade

eating the meat from sacriﬁcial animals after three days.”

‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr continued, “I mentioned that to ‘Amra bint
‘Abd ar-Raḥmān, and she aﬃrmed that he had spoken the truth as
she had heard ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘Some people
from the desert came at the time of the sacriﬁce in the time of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, so the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Store up
for three days, and give what is left over as ṣadaqa.”’”
She said that afterwards someone said to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
that people had been accustomed to make use of their sacriﬁcial
animals, melting the fat and curing the skins. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “What about it?” ey said, “You have forbidden the
meat of sacriﬁcial animals after three days.” e Messenger of Allah
356

‫ ﷺ‬said, “I only forbade you for the sake of the people who were

coming to you. Eat, give ṣadaqa, and store up.”

By these people, he meant the poor people who were coming to
Madīna.
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān that Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī returned from a journey and his
family gave him some meat. He asked whether it was meat from the
sacriﬁce. ey replied that it was. Abū Sa‘īd said, “Did not the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbid that?” ey said, “ere has been a
new command from the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬since you went
away.” Abū Sa‘īd went out and made enquiries about it and was told
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had said, “I forbade you before to
eat meat of the sacriﬁce after three days, but now eat, give ṣadaqa,
and store up. I forbade you before to make nabīdh (by soaking
raisins or dates in water), but now make nabīdh, but remember
every intoxicant is forbidden. I forbade you to visit graves, but now
visit them, and do not use bad language.”

23.5 Sharing sacriﬁcial animals
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

that Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh said, “We sacriﬁced with the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in the year of Ḥudaybiya, a camel shared between seven
people, and a cow between seven people.”

10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Umara ibn Yasār that ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār told him that Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī had told him, “We
used to sacriﬁce one sheep, and a man sacriﬁced for himself and his
family. en later on people began to compete with each other and
it became boasting.”

Mālik said, “e best that I have heard about a single camel, cow, or
sheep is that a man should sacriﬁce a camel for himself and his
family. He should sacriﬁce a cow or a sheep which he owns for the
family, and share with them in it. It is disapproved for a group of
357

people to buy a camel, cow or sheep to share for the ritual and
sacriﬁce, each giving a share of its price and taking a share of its
meat. We have heard the tradition that people do not share in the
ritual. However, it may be that the people of one household can
share.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬only sacriﬁced one camel or one cow for

himself and his family.”

Mālik said, “I do not know which of them Ibn Shihāb mentioned.”

23.6 e sacriﬁcial animal for the child in the womb and mention
of the Days of Sacriﬁce
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “e sacriﬁce can be done up to two days after the Day
of Sacriﬁce.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that the same had reached him
from ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib.
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar did not sacriﬁce for the child still in the womb.

Mālik said, “e sacriﬁce is sunna, but it is not obligatory. I prefer
that anyone who has the price of the animal should not abandon it.”

358

24. Slaughtering Animals
24.1 Saying the Name of Allah over the slaughtered animal
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his
father said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, was asked, ‘Messenger of

Allah! Some people from the desert bring us meat, and we do not
know whether the name of Allah has been mentioned over it or
not.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Mention the name of Allah
over it and eat.’”
Mālik said, “at was at the beginning of Islam.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Ayyāsh ibn Abī Rabi‘a al-Makhzūmī told one of his
slaves to slaughter an animal. When he wanted to slaughter it, he
said to him, “Mention Allah’s name.” e slave said to him, “I have
mentioned the name!” He said to him, “Mention the name of Allah,
bother you!” He said to him, “I have mentioned the name of Allah.”
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Ayyāsh said, “By Allah, I shall never eat it!”

24.2 Methods of slaughter permitted in necessity
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār that a man of the Anṣār from the tribe of Banū Ḥāritha
was herding a pregnant she-camel at Uḥud. It was about to die, so
he slaughtered it with a sharp stake. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was
asked about that, and he said, “ere is no harm in it, eat it.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from a one of the

Anṣār from Mu‘ādh ibn Sa‘d or Sa‘d ibn Mu‘ādh that a slave-girl of
Ka‘b ibn Mālik was herding some sheep at Sal‘ (a mountain near
Madīna). One of the sheep was about to die, so she went over to it
and slaughtered it with a stone. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was
asked about that, and he said, “ere is no harm in it, so eat it.”
359

5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī that

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās was asked about animals slaughtered by the
Christian Arabs. He said, “ere is no harm in them,” but he
recited this āyat, “Any of you who takes them as friends is one of
them.” (5:54)
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās used to

say, “You can eat anything that has had its jugular vein cut.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab said, “ere is no harm in whatever you slaughter with
a cutting edge, as long as you are forced to do it by necessity.”

24.3 What is disapproved of in slaughtering animals
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Abū

Murra, the mawlā of ‘Aqīl ibn Abī Ṭālib, asked Abū Hurayra about
a sheep which was slaughtered and then part of it moved. He
ordered him to eat it. en he asked Zayd ibn ābit about it, and
he said, “Does a corpse move?” and he forbade eating its meat.
Mālik was asked about a sheep which fell down and injured itself
badly and then its master reached it and slaughtered it. Blood
ﬂowed from it but it did not move. Mālik said, “If he kills it and
blood ﬂows from it and its eyes blink, he may eat.”

24.4 Slaughtering what is in the womb of a slaughtered animal
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “When a she-camel is slaughtered, what is in its womb
is included in the slaughter if it is perfectly formed and its hair has
begun to grow. If it comes out of its mother’s womb, it is
slaughtered so that blood ﬂows from its heart.”
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn

Qusayṭ al-Laythī that Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said, “e slaughter of
what is in the womb is included in the slaughter of the mother if it
is perfectly formed and its hair has begun to grow.”
360

25. Game
25.1 Eating game killed with throwing sticks and by stones
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ who said, “I was at al-

Juruf (near Madīna) and threw a stone at two birds, and hit them.
One of them died, and ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar threw it away, and then
went to slaughter the other one with an adze. It died before he
could slaughter it, so ‘Abdullāh threw that one away as well.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that al-Qāsim

ibn Muḥammad disapproved of eating game that had been killed
with throwing sticks and by clay pellets.
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab disapproved of killing domestic animals by any means
that game was slain such as arrows and the like.
Mālik said, “I do not see any harm in eating game which is pierced
by a throwing stick in a vital organ. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted!
said, ‘O you who believe, Allah will test you with game animals
which come within the reach of your hands and spears.’” (5:97)
Mālik said, “So any game that a man obtains by his hand or by his
spear or by any weapon which pierces it and reaches a vital organ, is
acceptable as Allah, the Exalted, has indicated.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard the people of

knowledge say that when a man hit game and something else might
have contributed to death, like water or an untrained dog, such
game was not to be eaten unless it was beyond doubt that it was the
arrow of the hunter that had killed it by piercing a vital organ, so
that it did not have any life after that.
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say that there was no harm in eating
game when you did not see it die if you found the mark of your dog
361

on it or your arrow in it as long as it had not remained overnight. If
it had remained overnight, then it was disapproved of to eat it.

25.2 Game caught by trained dogs
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said about a trained dog, “Eat whatever it catches for you
whether it kills it or not.”

6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard Nāﬁ‘ say that

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “Whether it eats from it or not.”

7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

Abī Waqqāṣ had said, when asked about a trained dog killing game,
“Eat, even if only one piece of it remains.”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard some of the

people of knowledge say that when falcons, eagles, and hawks and
their like, understand as trained dogs understand, there is no harm
in eating what they kill in the course of hunting, if the name of
Allah is mentioned when they were sent out.

Mālik said, “e best of what I have heard about retrieving game
from the falcon’s talons or from the mouth of a dog and then
waiting until it dies, is that it is not ḥalāl to eat it.”
Mālik said, “e same applies to anything which could have been
slaughtered by the hunter when it was in the talons of the falcon or
the mouth of a dog. If the hunter leaves it until the falcon or dog
has killed it, it is not lawful to eat it either.”
He continued, “e same thing applies to any game hit by a hunter
and caught while still alive, which he neglects to slaughter before it
dies.”
Mālik said, “It is generally agreed among us that it is lawful to eat
the game that a hunting-dog belonging to a Magian hunts or kills if
it is sent out by a Muslim and the animal is trained. ere is no
362

harm in it even if the Muslim does not actually slaughter it. at is
like a Muslim using a Magian’s knife to slaughter with or using his
bow and arrows to shoot and kill with. e game he shoots and the
animal he slaughters are ḥalāl. ere is no harm in eating them. If a
Magian sends out a Muslim’s hunting dog for game, and it catches
it, the game is not to be eaten unless it is slaughtered by a Muslim.
at is like a Magian using a Muslim’s bow and arrow to hunt game
with, or like his using a Muslim’s knife to slaughter with. It is not
lawful to eat anything killed like that.”

25.3 Catching sea animals
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān

ibn Abī Hurayra asked ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar about eating what was
cast up by the sea and he forbade him to eat it. en ‘Abdullāh
turned and asked for a Qur’ān, and read, “e game of the sea and
its ﬂesh are lawful for you.” (5:96)
Nāﬁ‘ added, “‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar sent me to ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn
Abī Hurayra to say that there was no harm in eating it.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that Sa‘īd

al-Jārī, the mawlā of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, asked ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar about ﬁsh which had killed each other or which had died
from severe cold. He said, “ere is no harm in eating them.” Sa‘d
said, “I then asked ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ and he said the
same.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from Abū

Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān from Abū Hurayra and Zayd ibn
ābit that they saw no harm in eating what was cast up by the sea.

12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from Abū

Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that some people from al-Jār came to
Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam and asked him about eating what was cast
up by the sea. He said, “ere is no harm in eating it.” Marwān
said, “Go to Zayd ibn ābit and Abū Hurayra and ask them about
363

it, then come to me and tell me what they say.” ey went to them
and asked them, and they both said, “ere is no harm in eating it.”
ey returned to Marwān and told him. Marwān said, “I told you.”
Mālik added that there was no harm in eating ﬁsh caught by
Magians, because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e water of the
sea is pure, and its dead creatures are ḥalāl.”
Mālik said, “Since that is eaten dead, it does not matter who has
caught it.”

25.4 Prohibition against eating animals with fangs
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū Idrīs

al-Khawlānī from Abū a‘laba al-Khushanī that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “It is unlawful to eat animals with fangs.”

14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ismā‘īl ibn Abī Ḥakīm

from ‘Abīda ibn Sufyān al-Ḥaḍrami from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Eating animals with fangs is ḥarām.”
Mālik said, “is is the custom among us.”

25.5 What is disapproved of regarding eating riding animals
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that the best of what he had

heard about horses, mules and donkeys was that they were not eaten
because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says, “And horses, mules
and donkeys both to ride and for adornment.” (16:8) He also says,
may He be Blessed and Exalted, about livestock, “Some for you to
ride and some to eat.” (40:79) He also says, the Blessed, the Exalted,
“So that they may mention the name of Allah over the livestock He
has given them ... eat of them and feed both those who ask and (alqāni‘) and those who are too shy to ask (al-mu‘tarr).” (22:34-36)
Mālik commented, “Allah mentions horses, mules and donkeys for
riding and adornment, and He mentions cattle for riding and
eating.”
364

Mālik said, “Al-qāni‘ also means the poor.”

25.6 Using the skin of animals found dead
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from
‘Ubaydullāh ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd that ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Abbās said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬passed by a dead sheep
which had been given to a mawlā of his wife, Maymūna. He asked,
‘Are you not going to use its skin?’ ey answered, ‘Messenger of
Allah, but it is carrion.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said. ‘Only
eating it is ḥarām.’”
16

17 Mālik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam from Ibn Wa‘la alMiṣrī from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

said, “A skin is pure when it has been tanned.”

18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn

Qusayṭ from Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn awbān from
his mother that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered that the skins of carrion be used
after they had been tanned.”

25.7 Eating carrion when forced to, out of necessity
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that the best of what he had

heard about a man who was forced by necessity to eat carrion was
that he ate it until he was full and then took provision from it. If he
found something which would enable him to dispense with it, he
threw it away.

Mālik, when asked whether or not a man who had been forced by
necessity to eat carrion, should eat it when he also found the fruit,
crops or sheep of a people in that place, answered, “If he thinks that
the owners of the fruit, crops or sheep will accept that it was a
necessity so that he will not be deemed a thief and have his hand cut
oﬀ, then I think that he should eat from what he ﬁnds whatever will
remove his hunger but he should not carry any of it away. I prefer
that he do that rather than eat carrion. If he fears that he will not be
365

believed, and will be deemed a thief for what he has taken, then I
think that it is better for him to eat the carrion, and he has leeway
to eat carrion in this respect. Even so, I fear that someone who is
not forced by necessity to eat carrion might exceed the limits out of
a desire to consume other people’s property, crops or fruit.”
Mālik said, “at is the best of what I have heard.”

366

26. e ‘Aqīqa
26.1 About the ‘aqīqa
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from a man
of the Banū Ḍamra that his father said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

was asked about the ‘aqīqa. He said, ‘I do not like disobedience
(‘uqūq),’ as if he disliked the name. He said, ‘If anyone has a child
born to him, and wants to sacriﬁce for his child, then let him do it.’”

2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad that
his father said, “Fāṭima, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

weighed the hair of Ḥasan, Ḥusayn, Zaynab and Umm Kulthum,
and gave away in ṣadaqa an equivalent weight of silver.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-

Raḥman that Muḥammad ibn ‘Alī ibn al-Ḥusayn said, “ Fāṭima, the
daughter of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, weighed the hair of Ḥasan
and Ḥusayn, and gave away in ṣadaqa the equivalent weight in
silver.”

26.2 Behaviour in the ‘aqīqa
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that if any of ‘Abdullāh

ibn ‘Umar’s family asked him for an ‘aqīqa, he would give it to them.
He gave a sheep as ‘aqīqa for both his male and female children.
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān that Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī said, “I heard my
father say that the ‘aqīqa was desirable, even if it was only a
sparrow.”

6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that there had been

an ‘aqīqa for Ḥasan and Ḥusayn, the sons of ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib.

367

7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father, ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr made an ‘aqīqa for his male and female
children of a sheep each.

Mālik said, “What we do about the ‘aqīqa is that if someone makes
an ‘aqīqa for his children, he gives a sheep for both male and female.
e ‘aqīqa is not obligatory but it is desirable to do it, and it is
something which people continue to do here (i.e. Madīna). If
someone makes an ‘aqīqa for his children, the same rules apply as
with all sacriﬁcial animals: one-eyed, emaciated, injured, or sick
animals must not be used, and neither the meat or the skin is to be
sold. e bones are broken and the family eat the meat and give
some of it away as ṣadaqa. e child is not smeared with any of the
blood.”

368

27. Fixed Shares of Inheritance
27.1 Inheritance of direct descendants
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik, “e generally agreed upon way of
doing things among us and what I have seen the people of
knowledge doing in our city about the ﬁxed shares of inheritance
(farā‘iḍ) of children from the mother or father when one or other of
them dies is that if they leave male and female children, the male
takes the portion of two females. If there are only females, and there
are more than two, they get two thirds of what is left between them.
If there is only one, she gets a half. If people with ﬁxed shares share
with the children and there are males among them, the reckoner
begins with the ones with ﬁxed shares. What remains after that is
divided among the children according to their inheritance.
“When there are no children, grandchildren through sons have the
same position as children, so that grandsons are like sons and granddaughters are like daughters. ey inherit as they inherit and they
preclude as the children preclude. If there are both children and
grandchildren through sons, and there is a male among the children,
then the grandchildren through sons do not share in the inheritance
with him.
“If there are no surviving males among the children, and there are
two or more daughters, grand-daughters through a son do not share
in the inheritance with them unless there is a male who is in the
same position as them in relation to the deceased, or further than
them. His presence gives access to whatever is left over, if any, to
whoever is in his position and whoever is above him of the granddaughters through sons. If something is left over, they divide it
among them, and the male takes the portion of two females. If
nothing is left over, they have nothing.

369

“If the only descendant is a daughter, she takes half, and if there are
one or more grand-daughters through a son, who are in the same
position to the deceased, they share a sixth. If there is a male in the
same position as the grand-daughters through a son in relation to
the deceased, they have no share and no sixth.
“If there is a surplus after the allotting of shares to the people with
ﬁxed shares, the surplus goes to the male and whoever is in his
position and whoever is above him of the female descendants
through sons. e male receives the share of two females. e one
who is more distant in relationship than grandchildren through sons
has nothing. If there is no surplus, they receive nothing. at is
because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in is Book, ‘Allah
instructs you regarding your children: A male gets the same as the
share of two females. If there are more than two daughters they get
two-thirds of what you leave. If she is one on her own she gets a
half.’” (4:11)

27.2 Inheritance of husbands from wives and wives from
husbands
Mālik said, “e inheritance of a husband from a wife, when she
leaves no children or grandchildren through sons, is a half. If she
leaves children or grandchildren through sons, male or female, by
her present or any previous husband, the husband has a quarter after
bequests or debts. e inheritance of a wife from a husband who
does not leave children or grandchildren through sons is a quarter. If
he leaves children or grandchildren through sons, male or female,
the wife has an eighth after bequests and debts. at is because
Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted! says in His Book, ‘You get half of
what your wives leave if they are childless. If they have children you
get a quarter of what they leave after any bequest they make or any
debts. ey get a quarter of what you leave if you are childless. If
you have children they get an eighth of what you leave after any
bequest you make or any debts.’” (4:12)

27.3 Inheritance of fathers and mothers from children
370

Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us,
about which there is no dispute and what I have seen the people of
knowledge in our city doing, is that when a father inherits from a
son or a daughter and the deceased leaves children or grandchildren
through a son, the father has a ﬁxed share of one sixth. If the
deceased does leave any children or male grandchildren through a
son, the apportioning begins with those with whom the father
shares in the ﬁxed shares. ey are given their ﬁxed shares. If a sixth
or more is left over, the sixth and what is above it is given to the
father, and if there is less than a sixth left, the father is given his
sixth as a ﬁxed share (i.e. the other shares are adjusted).”
“e inheritance of a mother from her child, if her son or daughter
dies and leaves children, male or female, or grandchildren through a
son, or leaves two or more full or half siblings, is a sixth. If the
deceased does not leave any children or grandchildren through a
son, or two or more siblings, the mother has a whole third except in
two cases. One of them is if a man dies and leaves a wife and both
his parents. e wife has a fourth, the mother a third of what
remains (which is a fourth of the capital). e other is if a wife dies
and leaves a husband and both her parents. e husband gets half,
and the mother a third of what remains, (which is a sixth of the
capital). at is because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in His
Book, ‘Each of your parents get a sixth of what you leave if you have
children. If you are childless and your heirs are your parents your
mother gets a third. If you have brothers or sisters your mother gets
a sixth.’ (4:11) e sunna is that the siblings referred to be two or
more.”

27.4 Inheritance of maternal half-siblings
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-upon way of doing things among
us is that maternal half-siblings do not inherit anything when there
are children or grandchildren through sons, male or female. ey do
not inherit anything when there is a father or the father’s father.
ey inherit in what is outside of that. If there is only one male or
371

female, they are given a sixth. If there are two, each of them has a
sixth. If there are more than that, they share in a third which is
divided among them. e male does not have the portion of two
females. at is because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in His
Book, ‘If a man or woman has no direct heirs but has a brother or
sister, each of them gets a sixth. If there are more than that they
share in a third.’” (4:12) So males and females are alike in regard to
this.

27.5 Inheritance of full-siblings
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
is that full-siblings do not inherit anything with sons nor anything
with grandsons through a son, nor anything with the father. ey do
inherit with the daughters and the grand-daughters through a son
when the deceased does not leave a paternal grandfather. ey are
considered in any property that is left over as paternal relations. One
begins with the people who are allotted ﬁxed shares. ey are given
their shares. If there is anything left over after that, it belongs to the
full-siblings. ey divide it between themselves according to the
Book of Allah, whether they are male or female. e male has a
portion of two females. If there is nothing left over, they receive
nothing.
“If the deceased does not leave a father or a paternal grandfather or
children or male or female grandchildren through a son, a single full
sister gets a half. If there are two or more full sisters, they get twothirds. If there is a brother with them, sisters, whether one or more,
do not have a ﬁxed share. One begins with whoever shares in the
ﬁxed shares. ey are given their shares. Whatever remains after
that goes to the full-siblings. e male has the portion of two
females except in one case, in which the full-siblings have nothing.
ey share in this case the third of the half-siblings by the mother.
at case is when a woman dies and leaves a husband, a mother,
half-siblings by her mother, and full-siblings. e husband has a
half. e mother has one sixth. e half-siblings by the mother have
372

a third. Nothing is left after that, so the full-siblings share in this
case with the half-siblings by the mother in their third. e males
have the portion of two females inasmuch as all of them are siblings
of the deceased by the mother. ey inherit by the mother. at is
because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in His Book, ‘If a man
or a woman has no direct heir and he has a brother or sister, each
one of the two gets a sixth. If there are more than that, they share
equally in the third.’ (4:12) ey therefore share in this case because
they all are siblings of the deceased by the mother.”

27.6 Inheritance of paternal half-siblings
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
is that when there are no full-siblings with them, half-siblings by
the father take the position of full-siblings. eir males are like the
males of the full-siblings, and their females are like their females
except in the case where the half-siblings by the mother and the
full-siblings share, because they are not oﬀspring of the mother who
joins these.”
Mālik said, “If there are both full-siblings and half-siblings by the
father and there is a male among the full-siblings, none of the halfsiblings by the father have any inheritance. If there is one or more
females in the full-siblings and there is no male with them, the one
full-sister gets a half, and the half-sister by the father gets a sixth,
completing the two-thirds. If there is a male with the half-sisters by
the father, they have no share. e people of ﬁxed shares are given
their shares and, if there is something left after that, it is divided
between the half-siblings by the father. e male gets the portion of
two females. If there is nothing left over, they get nothing. Halfsiblings by the mother, full-siblings, and half-siblings by the father,
each have a sixth (when they are only one). Two and more share a
third. e male has the same portion as the female. ey are in the
same position in this case.”

27.7 Inheritance of grandfathers
373

1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he had

heard that Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān wrote to Zayd ibn ābit
asking him about the grandfather. Zayd ibn ābit wrote to him.
“You have written to me asking me about the grandfather. Allah
knows best. is belongs to those matters left to the determination
of the commanders, i.e. the caliphs. I was present with two caliphs
before you who gave the grandfather a half with one sibling, and a
third with two. If there were more siblings, they did not decrease his
third.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Qabīṣa ibn

Dhū’ayb that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb gave the grandfather “what
people him give today.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sulaymān

ibn Yasār said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān, and Zayd
ibn ābit gave the grandfather a third with full-siblings.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
and what I have seen the people of knowledge in our city doing is
that the paternal grandfather does not inherit anything at all with
the father. He is given a sixth as a ﬁxed share with the son and the
grandson through a son. Other than that, when the deceased does
not leave a mother or a paternal aunt, one begins with whoever has a
ﬁxed share, and they are given their shares. If there is a sixth of the
property left over, the grandfather is given a sixth as a ﬁxed share.”
Mālik said, “When someone shares with the grandfather and the
full siblings in a speciﬁed share, one begins with whoever shares
with them of the people of ﬁxed shares. ey are given their shares.
What is left over after that belongs to the grandfather and the fullsiblings. en one sees which is the more favourable of two
alternatives for the portion of the grandfather. Either a third is
allotted to him and the siblings to divide between them, and he gets
a share as if he were one of the siblings, or else he takes a sixth from
all the capital. Whichever is the best portion for the grandfather is
given to him. What is left after that goes to the full-siblings. e
374

male gets the portion of two females except in one particular case.
e division in this case is diﬀerent from the preceding one. is
case is when a woman dies and leaves a husband, mother, full sister
and grandfather. e husband gets a half, the mother gets a third,
the grandfather gets a sixth, and the full sister gets a half. e sixth
of the grandfather and the half of the sister are joined and divided
into thirds. e male gets the share of two females. erefore, the
grandfather has two thirds of it, and the sister has one third of it”
Mālik said, “e inheritance of the half-siblings by the father with
the grandfather, when there are no full-siblings with them, is like
the inheritance of the full-siblings (in the same situation). e males
are the same as their males and the females are the same as their
females. When there are both full-siblings and half-siblings by the
father, the full-siblings include in their number the half-siblings by
the father in order to limit the inheritance of the grandfather, i.e. if
there was only one full-sibling with the grandfather, they would
share, after the allotting of the ﬁxed shares, the remainder of the
inheritance between them equally. If there were also two halfsiblings by the father, their number is added to the division of the
sum, which would then be divided four ways. A quarter going to the
grandfather and three-quarters going to the full-siblings who annex
the shares technically allotted to the half-siblings by the father. ey
do not include the number of half-siblings by the mother because if
there were only half-siblings by the father they would not inherit
anything after the portion of the grandfather.
“It belongs to the full-siblings more than the half-siblings by the
father, and the half-siblings by the father do not get anything with
them unless the full-siblings consist of one sister. If there is one full
sister, she includes the grandfather with the half-siblings by her
father in the division, however many. Whatever remains for her and
these half-siblings by the father goes to her rather than them until
she has had her complete share, which is half of the total capital. If
there is surplus beyond half of all the capital in what she and the
half-siblings by the father acquire, it goes to them. e male receives
375

the portion of two females. If there is nothing left over, they get
nothing.”

27.8 Inheritance of grandmothers
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Uthmān

ibn Isḥāq ibn Kharasha that Qabīṣa ibn Dhū’ayb said, “A
grandmother came to Abū Bakr as-Ṣiddīq and asked him for her
inheritance. Abū Bakr said to her, ‘You have nothing in the Book of
Allah, and I do not know that you have anything in the sunna of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. Go away therefore, until I have questioned
the people (i.e. the Companions).’ He questioned the people, and
al-Mughīra ibn Shu‘ba said, ‘I was present with the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬when he gave the grandmother a sixth.’ Abū Bakr asked,
‘Was there anybody else with you?’ Muḥammad ibn Maslama alAnsārī stood up and said the like of what al-Mughīra had said. Abū
Bakr aṣ-Siddiq gave it to her. en the other grandmother came to
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and asked him for her inheritance. He said to
her, ‘You have nothing in the Book of Allah, and what has been
decided is only for other than you, and I am not one to add to the
ﬁxed shares, other than that sixth. If there are two of you together, it
is between you. If either of you is left alone with it, it is hers.’”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad said, “Two grandmothers came to Abū Bakr
aṣ-Ṣiddīq, and he wanted to give the sixth to the one who was from
the mother’s side, and a man of the Ansār said, ‘What? Are you
omitting the one from whom he would inherit if she died while he
was still alive?’ Abū Bakr divided the sixth between them.”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdu Rabbih ibn Sa‘īd that

Abū Bakr ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām only gave
a ﬁxed share to two grandmothers (together).

Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
in which there is no dispute, and which I saw the people of
knowledge in our city doing, is that the maternal grandmother does
376

not inherit anything at all with the mother. Outside of that, she is
given a sixth as a ﬁxed share. e paternal grandmother does not
inherit anything along with the mother of the father. Outside of
that she is given a sixth as a ﬁxed share.”
If both the paternal grandmother and maternal grandmother are
alive, and the deceased does not have a father or a mother other
than them, Mālik said, “I have heard that if the maternal
grandmother is the nearest of the two of them, then she has a sixth
instead of the paternal grandmother. If the paternal grandmother is
nearer, or they are in the same position in relation to the deceased,
the sixth is divided equally between them.”
Mālik said, “None of the female grandrelations except for these two
has any inheritance because I have heard that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave the grandmother inheritance, and then Abū Bakr
asked about that until someone reliable related from the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬that he had made the grandmother an heir and given a
share to her. Another grandmother came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb,
and he said, ‘I am not one to add to the ﬁxed shares. If there are two
of you together, it is between you. If either of you is left alone with
it, it is hers.’”
Mālik said, “We do not know of anyone who made other than the
two grandmothers heirs from the beginning of Islam to this day.”

27.9 Inheritance of persons without parents or oﬀspring
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about someone who

died without parents or oﬀspring (i.e. he asked about “kalāla”) and
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him, “e āyat which was sent
down in the summer at the end of the Sūrat an-Nisā’ (4) is enough
for you.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us,
in which there is no dispute, and which I saw the people of
377

knowledge in our city doing, is that the person who leaves neither
parent or oﬀspring can be of two types. As for the kind described in
the āyat which was sent down at the beginning of Sūrat an-Nisā’ in
which Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says, ‘If a man or a woman
has no direct heir and he has a brother or sister, each one of the two
gets a sixth. If there are more than that, they share equally in the
third.’ (4:12) is heirless one does not have heirs among his
mother’s siblings since there are no children or parents. As for the
other kind described in the āyat which comes at the end of the Sūrat
an-Nisā’, Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in it, ‘ey will ask
you for a deﬁnitive ruling. Say: “Allah gives you a deﬁnitive ruling
about people who die without direct heirs: If a man dies childless
but has a sister she gets half of what he leaves. And he is her heir if
she dies childless. If there are two sisters they get two-thirds of what
he leaves. If there are brothers and sisters the males get the share of
two females. Allah makes things clear to you so you will not go
astray. Allah has knowledge of all things.’” (4:176)
Mālik said, “If this person without direct heirs (parents) or children
has siblings by the father, they inherit with the grandfather from
this person without direct heirs. e grandfather inherits with the
siblings because he is more entitled to the inheritance than them.
at is because he inherits a sixth with the male children of the
deceased when the siblings do not inherit anything with the male
children of the deceased. How can he not be like one of them when
he takes a sixth with the children of the deceased? How can he not
take a third with the siblings while the brother’s sons take a third
with them? e grandfather is the one who overshadows the halfsiblings by the mother and keeps them from inheriting. He is more
entitled to what they have because they are omitted for his sake. If
the grandfather did not take that third, the half-siblings by the
mother would take it and would take what does not return to the
half-siblings by the father. e half-siblings by the mother are more
entitled to that third than the half-siblings by the father while the
grandfather is not less entitled to that than the half-siblings by the
mother.”

27.10 Paternal aunts
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr

ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm that ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn
Ḥanẓala az-Zuraqī was informed by a mawlā of Quraysh, who used
to be known as Ibn Mirsa, that he was sitting with ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb, and when they had prayed Ẓuhr, he said, “Yarfā! Bring that
letter! (A letter which he had written about the paternal aunt). We
asked about her and asked for information about her.” Yarfā brought
it to him. He called for a small vessel or drinking-bowl in which
there was water. He erased the letter in it. en he said, “Had Allah
approved of you as an heir, we would have conﬁrmed you. Had
Allah approved of you, He would have conﬁrmed you.”
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Muḥammad ibn Abī Bakr

ibn Ḥazm heard his father say many times, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
used to remark, ‘It is a wonder that the paternal aunt is inherited
from but does not inherit.’”

27.11 Inheritance of paternal relations (‘aṣaba)
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us,
in which there is no dispute, and which I saw the people of
knowledge in our city doing, about paternal relations, is that fullbrothers are more entitled to inherit than half-brothers by the
father, and half-brothers by the father are more entitled to inherit
than the children of the full-brothers. e sons of the full-brothers
are more entitled to inherit than the sons of the half-brothers by the
father. e sons of the half-brothers by the father are more entitled
to inherit than the sons of the sons of the full-brothers. e sons of
the sons of the half-brothers on the father’s side are more entitled to
inherit than the paternal uncle, the full brother of the father. e
paternal uncle, the full brother of the father, is more entitled to
inherit than the paternal uncle, the half-brother of the father on the
father’s side. e paternal uncle, the half-brother of the father on
the father’s side, is more entitled to inherit than the sons of the
paternal uncle, the full-brother of the father. e son of the paternal
379

uncle on the father’s side is more entitled to inherit than the
paternal great uncle, the full-brother of the paternal grandfather.”
Mālik said, “Everything about which you are questioned concerning
the inheritance of the paternal relations is like this. Trace the
genealogy of the deceased and whoever among the paternal relations
contends for inheritance. If you ﬁnd that one of them reaches the
deceased by a father, and none of them except him reaches him by a
father, then grant the inheritance to the one who reaches him by the
nearest father, rather than the one who reaches him by what is above
that. If you ﬁnd that they all reach him by the same father who joins
them, then see who is the nearest of kin. If there is only one halfbrother by the father, give him the inheritance rather than more
distant paternal relations. If there is a full-brother and you ﬁnd
them equally related from a number of fathers or to one particular
father, so that they all reach the genealogy of the deceased and they
are all half-brothers by the father or full-brothers, then divide the
inheritance equally among them. If the parent of one of them is an
uncle (the full-brother of the father of the deceased) and whoever is
with him is an uncle (the paternal half-brother of the father of the
deceased), the inheritance goes to the sons of the full brother of the
father rather than the sons of the paternal half-brother of the father.
at is because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says, ‘But blood
relations are closer to one another in Allah’s Book. Allah has
knowledge of all things.’ (8:75)”
Mālik said, “e paternal grandfather is more entitled to inherit
than the sons of the full-brother, and more entitled than the uncle,
the full brother of the father. e son of the father’s brother is more
entitled to inherit from mawālī retainers (freed slaves) than the
grandfathers.”

27.12 People who do not inherit
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
in which there is no dispute, and which I saw the people of
knowledge in our city doing, is that the child of the half-sibling by
380

the mother, the paternal grandfather, the paternal uncle who is the
maternal half-brother of the father, the maternal uncle, the great
grandmother who is the mother of the mother’s father, the daughter
of the full-brother, the paternal aunt, and the maternal aunt do not
inherit anything by their kinship.”
Mālik said, “Any woman who is more distantly related to the
deceased than those who were named in this Book, does not inherit
anything by her kinship, and women do not inherit anything apart
from those that are named in the Qur’ān. Allah, the Blessed, the
Exalted, mentions in His Book the inheritance of the mother from
her children, the inheritance of the daughters from their father, the
inheritance of the wife from her husband, the inheritance of the
full-sisters, the inheritance of the half-sisters by the father and the
inheritance of the half-sisters by the mother. e grandmother is
made an heir by the example the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬made about her. A
woman inherits from a slave she frees herself because Allah, the
Blessed, the Exalted, says in His Book, ‘ey are your brothers in
the dīn and people under your patronage.’ (33:5)”

27.13 Inheritance from the people of other religions
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Alī ibn

Ḥusayn ibn ‘Alī from ‘Umar ibn Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān from Usāma ibn
Zayd that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A Muslim does not
inherit from a unbeliever.”

11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ‘Alī ibn

Ḥusayn in ‘Alī ibn Abī Tālib told him that ‘Aqīl and Ṭālib inherited
from Abū Ṭālib, and ‘Alī did not inherit from him. ‘Alī said,
“Because of that, we have given up our portion of ash-Shi‘b (a house
belonging to the Banū Hāshim).”
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Sulaymān ibn Yasār that Muḥammad ibn al-Ash‘ath told him that
he had a Christian or Jewish paternal aunt who died. Muḥammad
ibn al-Ash‘ath mentioned that to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and asked
381

him, “Who inherits from her?” ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said to him,
“e people of her dīn inherit from her.” en he went to ‘Umar ibn
‘Aﬀān, and asked him about that. ‘Uthmān said to him, “Do you
think that I have forgotten what ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb told you? e
people of her dīn inherit from her.”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Ismā‘īl ibn Abī Ḥakīm that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz freed a
Christian who then died. Ismā‘īl said, “‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz
ordered me to put his property in the Treasury.”
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from a reliable source of his who

had heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb refused
to let anyone inherit from the non-Arabs except for one who was
born among the Arabs.”
Mālik said, “If a pregnant woman comes from the land of the
enemy and gives birth in Arab land then he is considered to be her
child. He inherits from her if she dies, and she inherits from him if
he dies, by the Book of Allah.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
and the sunna in which there is no dispute, and what I saw the
people of knowledge in our city doing, is that a Muslim does not
inherit from a unbeliever by kinship, clientage (walā’), or maternal
relationship, nor does he (the Muslim) bar any (of the unbelievers)
from his inheritance.”
Mālik said, “Similarly, someone who forgoes his inheritance when
he is the chief heir does not bar anyone from his inheritance.”

27.14 People killed in battle or otherwise whose situation in
inheritance is not known
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān from more than one of the people of knowledge of that
time, that those who were killed on the Day of the Camel, the Day
of Ṣiﬀīn, the Day of al-Ḥarra, and the Day of Qudayd did not
382

inherit from each other. None of them inherited anything from his
companion unless it was known that he had been killed before his
companion.
Mālik said, “at is the way of doing things about which there is no
dispute, and which none of the people of knowledge in our city
doubt. e procedure with two mutual heirs who are drowned, or
killed in another way, when it is not known which of them died ﬁrst
is the same – neither of them inherits anything from his companion.
eir inheritance goes to whoever remains of their heirs. ey are
inherited from by the living.”
Mālik said, “No one should inherit from anyone else when there is
doubt, and one should only inherit from the other when there is
certainty of knowledge and witnesses. at is because a man and his
mawlā whom his father has freed might die at the same time. e
sons of the free man could say, ‘Our father inherited from the
mawlā.’ ey should not inherit from the mawlā without knowledge
or testimony that he died ﬁrst. e living people most entitled to his
walā’ inherit from him.”
Mālik said, “Another example is two full brothers who die. One of
them has children and the other does not. ey have a half-brother
by their father. It is not known which of them died ﬁrst, so the
inheritance of the childless one goes to his half-brother by the
father. e children of the full-brother get nothing.”
Mālik said, “Another example is when a paternal aunt and the son of
her brother die, or else the daughter of the brother and her paternal
uncle. It is not known which of them died ﬁrst. e paternal uncle
does not inherit anything from the daughter of his brother, and the
son of the brother does not inherit anything from his paternal aunt.”

27.15 e inheritance of the child of li‘ān and the child of
fornication

383

16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr said about the child of li‘ān and the child of fornication,
that, if they died, the mother inherited her right from them
according to the Book of Allah, the Mighty, the Majestic! e
siblings by the mother had their rights. e rest was inherited by the
former masters of the mother if she was a freed slave. If she was a
free woman by origin, she inherited her due and the siblings by the
mother inherited their due, and the rest went to the Muslims.
Mālik said, “I heard the same as that from Sulaymān ibn Yasār.”
Mālik said, “at is what I have seen the people of knowledge in
our city doing.”

384

28. Marriage
28.1 Asking for someone’s hand in marriage
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn

Ḥabbān from al-A‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do not ask for a woman in marriage when another
Muslim has already done so.”

2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do not ask for a

woman in marriage when another Muslim has already done so.”

Mālik said, “e explanation of the statement of the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬according to what we think – and Allah, the Blessed, the
Exalted, knows best – is that, ‘Do not ask for a woman in marriage
when another Muslim has already done so,’ means that when a man
has asked for a woman in marriage, and she has inclined to him and
they have agreed on a bride-price and are mutually satisﬁed (with
the arrangement), and she has made any conditions for herself, it is
forbidden for another man to ask for that woman in marriage. It
does not mean that when a man has asked for a woman in marriage
and his suit does not agree with her and she does not incline to him
that no one else can ask for her in marriage. at is a door to misery
for people.”
YA 3 ḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn alQāsim that his father said about the words of Allah, the Blessed, the
Exalted, “Nor is there anything wrong in any allusion to marriage
you make to a woman, nor for any you keep to yourself. Allah
knows that you will say things to them. But do not make secret
arrangements with them, rather only speak with correctness and
courtesy,” (2:235) that it referred to a man saying to a woman while
she was still in her ‘idda after the death of her husband, “You are

385

dear to me, and I desire you, and Allah brings provision and blessing
to you,” and such words as these.

28.2 Asking the consent of virgins and women previously married
4 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn al-Faḍl from Nāﬁ‘ ibn

Jubayr ibn Muṭ‘im from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A woman who has been previously married is more
entitled to her person than her guardian, and a virgin must be asked
for her consent and her silence is her consent.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab had said that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “A woman is
only married with the consent of either her guardian or someone of
her family with sound judgment or the ruler.”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that al-Qāsim

ibn Muḥammad and Sālim ibn ‘Abdullāh would marry oﬀ their
virgin daughters without consulting them.
Mālik said, “at is what is done among us about the marriage of
virgins.”

Mālik said, “A virgin has no right to her property until she enters
her house and her state (competence, maturity, etc.) is known for
sure.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that al-Qāsim

ibn Muḥammad and Sālim ibn ‘Abdullāh and Sulaymān ibn Yasār
said about the virgin given by her father in marriage without her
permission, “It is binding on her.”

28.3 e bride-price and unreturnable gifts
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Ḥāzim ibn Dīnār from

Sahl ibn Sa‘d as-Sā‘idī that a woman came to the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said, “Messenger of Allah! I have given myself to you.”
She stood for a long time, and then a man got up and said,
386

“Messenger of Allah, marry her to me if you have no need of her.”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do you have anything to give her
as a bride-price?” He said, “I possess only this lower garment of
mine.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If you give it to her you
will not have a garment to wear, so look for something else.” He
said, “I have nothing else.” He said, “Look for something else, even
if it is only an iron ring.” He looked, and found that he had nothing.
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do you know any of the Qur’ān?”
He said, “Yes, I know such-and-such a sūra and such-and-such a
sūra,” which he named. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him, “I
have married her to you for what you know of the Qur’ān.”
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab had said that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “If a man
marries a woman who is insane, or has leprosy or white leprosy,
without being told of her condition by her guardian, and he has
sexual relations with her, she keeps her bride-price in its entirety.
Her husband is entitled to damages against her guardian.”
Mālik said, “e husband is entitled to damages against her
guardian when the guardian is her father, brother, or one who is
deemed to have knowledge of her condition. If the guardian who
gives her in marriage is a nephew, a mawlā, or a member of her tribe
who is not deemed to have knowledge of her condition, there are no
damages against him, and the woman returns what she has taken of
her bride-price, and the husband leaves her whatever amount is
thought to be fair.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that the daughter of

‘Ubaydullāh ibn ‘Umar, whose mother was the daughter of Zayd ibn
al-Khaṭṭāb, married the son of ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar. He died and
had not yet consummated the marriage or speciﬁed her bride-price.
Her mother wanted the bride-price and ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said,
“She is not entitled to a bride-price. Had she been entitled to a
bride-price, we would not have kept it and we would not do her an
injustice.” e mother refused to accept that. Zayd ibn ābit was
387

brought to adjudicate between them and he decided that she had no
bride-price, but that she did inherit.
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

‘Abd al-‘Azīz, during his khalifate, wrote to one of his governors,
“Whatever a father or guardian, giving someone in marriage, makes
a condition in the way of unreturnable gift or favour belongs to the
woman if she wants it.”
Mālik spoke about a woman whose father gave her in marriage and
made an unreturnable gift a condition of the bride-price which was
to be given. He said, “Whatever is given as a condition, by which
marriage occurs, belongs to the woman if she wants it. If the
husband parts from her before the marriage is consummated, the
husband has half of the unreturnable gift, by which the marriage
occurred.”
Mālik said about a man who married oﬀ his young son and the son
had no wealth at all, that the bride-price was obliged of the father if
the young man had no property on the day of marriage. If the young
man did have property, the bride-price was taken from his property,
unless the father stipulated that he would pay the bride-price
himself. e marriage was aﬃrmed for the son if he was a minor
and was under the guardianship of his father.
Mālik said that if a man divorced his wife before he had
consummated the marriage, and she was a virgin, her father
returned half of the bride-price to him. at half was permitted to
the husband from the father to compensate him for his expenses.
Mālik said that was because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in
His Book, “unless they (women with whom he had not
consummated marriage) forgo it or the one in charge of the
marriage contract forgoes it.” (2:237) (He being the father of a virgin
daughter or the master of a female slave).

388

Mālik said, “at is what I have heard about the matter, and that is
how things are done among us.”
Mālik said that a Jewish or Christian woman who was married to a
Jew or Christian and then became Muslim before the marriage had
been consummated was not owed any bride-price.
Mālik said, “I do not think that women should be married for less
than a quarter of a dinar. at is the lowest amount for which
cutting oﬀ the hand is obliged.”

28.4 Consummating a marriage
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘d from Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb decided, in the case of a
woman who was married by a man and the marriage had been
consummated, that the bride-price was obligatory.
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Zayd ibn

ābit said, “When a man takes his wife to his house and cohabits
with her, then the bride-price is obliged.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab said, “When a man comes to his wife in her room, he is
believed. When she comes to him in his room, she is believed.”
Mālik commented, “I think that this refers to sexual intercourse.
When he comes into her in her room and she says, ‘He has had
intercourse with me’ and he says, ‘I have not touched her,’ he is
believed. When she comes to him in his room and he says, ‘I have
not had intercourse with her’ and she says, ‘He had intercourse with
me,’ she is believed.”

28.5 Wedding nights of virgins and of women previously married
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Hāzim from ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Abī Bakr
ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām al-Makhzūmī from
389

his father that when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬married Umm
Salama and then spent the night with her, he said to her, “You are
not being humbled in your right. If you wish, I will stay with you for
seven nights and stay seven nights (each) with the others. If you
wish, I will stay with you for three nights, and then visit the others
in turn.” She said, “Stay three nights.”
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Humayd aṭ-Ṭawīl that

Anas ibn Mālik said, “A virgin has seven nights, and a woman who
has been previously married has three nights.”
Mālik aﬃrmed, “at is what is done among us.”

Mālik said, “If a man takes another wife, he divides his time equally
between them after the wedding nights. He does not count the
wedding nights against the one he has just married.”

28.6 Stipulations not permitted in marriage
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab was asked about a woman who made a stipulation on
her husband not to take her away from her town. Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab said, “He takes her away if she wishes.”

Mālik said, “e custom among us is that when a man marries a
woman, and he makes a condition in the marriage contract that he
will not marry after her or take a concubine, it means nothing unless
there is an oath of divorce or setting-free attached to it. en it is
obliged and required of him.”

28.7 Marriage of a muḥallil and its like
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from al-Miswar ibn Rifā‘a al-

Quraẓī from az-Zubayr ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn az-Zubayr that
Rifā‘a ibn Simwāl divorced his wife, Tamīma bint Wahb, in the time
of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬three times. She then married ‘Abd arRahmān ibn az-Zubayr and he turned from her and could not
consummate the marriage and so he parted from her. Rifā‘a wanted
390

to marry her again and it was mentioned to the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬and he forbade him to marry her. He said, “She is not lawful for
you until she has tasted the sweetness of intercourse.”
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from alQāsim ibn Muḥammad that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said

when asked whether it was permissible for a man to marry again a
wife he had divorced irrevocably, if she had married another man
who divorced her before consummating the marriage, “Not until she
has tasted the sweetness of intercourse.”
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that, when

asked whether it was permissible for a man to return to his wife if he
had divorced her irrevocably and then another man had married her
after him and had died before consummating the marriage, alQāsim ibn Muḥammad said, “It is not lawful for the ﬁrst husband
to return to her.”
Mālik said that the muḥallil could not remain in such a marriage so
as to allow a new marriage. If he had intercourse with her in that
marriage, she kept her dowry.

28.8 Combinations of women not to be married together
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “One

cannot be married to a woman and her paternal aunt, or a woman
and her maternal aunt at the same time.”

21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab said, “It is forbidden to be married to a woman
and her paternal or maternal aunt at the same time, and for a man
to have intercourse with a female slave who is carrying another
man’s child.”

28.9 Prohibition against marrying mothers of wives

391

22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Zayd

ibn ābit asked whether it was lawful for a man, who married a
woman and then separated from her before he had cohabited with
her, to marry her mother. Zayd ibn ābit said, “No. e mother is
prohibited unconditionally. ere are conditions, however, about
foster-mothers.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from more than one source that

when ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd was in Kufa, he was asked for an
opinion about marrying the mother after marrying the daughter
when the marriage with the daughter had not been consummated.
He permitted it. When Ibn Mas‘ūd came to Madīna, he asked
about it and was told that it was not as he had said, and that this
condition referred to foster-mothers. Ibn Mas‘ūd returned to Kufa,
and he had just reached his dwelling when the man who had asked
him for the opinion came to visit and he ordered him to separate
from his wife.
Mālik said that if a man married the mother of a woman who was
his wife and he had sexual relations with the mother, then his wife
was unlawful for him and he had to separate from both of them.
ey were both unlawful to him forever if he had had sexual
relations with the mother. If he did not have relations with the
mother, his wife was not unlawful for him, and he is separated from
the mother.
Mālik explained further about the man who married a woman, and
then married her mother and cohabited with her, “e mother will
never be lawful for him, and she is not lawful for his father or his
son, and any daughters of hers are not lawful for him, and so his
wife is unlawful for him.”
Mālik said, “Fornication, however, does not make any of that
unlawful because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, mentions ‘the
mothers of your wives,’ as one whom marriage made unlawful, and
He did not mention the making unlawful through fornication.
392

Every marriage in a lawful manner in which a man cohabits with his
wife is a lawful marriage.
“is is what I have heard, and this is how things are done among
us.”

28.10 Marriage to mothers of women with whom one has had
sexual relations in a disapproved manner
Mālik said that a man who had committed fornication with a
woman, for which the ḥadd-punishment had been applied to him,
could marry that woman’s daughter and his son could marry the
woman herself if he wished. at was because he had unlawful
relations with her, and the relations Allah had made unlawful were
from the relations made in a lawful manner or in a manner
resembling marriage. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says, “Do not
marry any women your fathers married.” (4:21)
Mālik said, “If a man were to marry a woman in her ‘idda period in
a lawful marriage and have relations with her, it would be unlawful
for his son to marry the woman. at is because the father married
her in a lawful manner, and the ḥadd-punishment would not have
been applied to him. Any child who was born to him would be
attached to the father. Just as it would be unlawful for the son to
marry a woman whom his father had married in her ‘idda period
and had relations with, so the woman’s daughter would be unlawful
for the father if he had had sexual relations with the mother.”

28.11 What is not permitted in marriage in general
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade shighār, which

means one man giving his daughter in marriage to another man on
the condition that the other gives his daughter to him in marriage
without either of them paying the bride-price.
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim from his father from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān and Mujammi‘, the
393

sons of Yazīd ibn Jāriya al-Anṣārī from Khansā’ bint Khidām alAnṣāriya, that her father gave her in marriage and she had been
previously married. She disapproved of that and went to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he revoked the marriage.
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

that a case was brought to ‘Umar about a marriage which had only
been witnessed by one man and one woman. He said, “is is a
secret marriage and I do not permit it. Had I been the ﬁrst to come
upon it, I would have ordered them to be stoned.”
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab and from Sulaymān ibn Yasār that Ṭulayha al-Asadiya
was the wife of Rushayd ath-aqafī. He divorced her and she got
married in her ‘idda period. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb beat her and her
husband with a stick several times, and separated them. en ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “If a woman marries in her ‘idda period, and the
new husband has not consummated the marriage, then separate
them, and when she has completed the ‘idda of her ﬁrst husband,
the other becomes a suitor. If he has consummated the marriage,
then separate them. en she must complete her ‘idda from her ﬁrst
husband, and then the ‘idda from the other one, and they are never
to be reunited.”
Mālik added, “Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said that she had her dowry
because he had consummated the marriage.”

Mālik said, “e practice with us concerning a freewoman whose
husband dies is that she does an ‘idda of four months and ten days
and she does not marry if she doubts her period until she is free of
any doubt or if she fears that she is pregnant.”

28.12 Marrying slaves when already married to free women
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Abdullāh

ibn ‘Abbās and ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar were asked about a man who

394

had a freewoman as a wife and then wanted to marry a slave-girl.
ey disapproved that he should be married to both of them.
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab said, “One does not marry slave-girl when married
to a freewoman unless the freewoman wishes it. If the freewoman
complies, she has two-thirds of the division of time.”
Mālik said, “A freeman must not marry a slave-girl when he can
aﬀord to marry a freewoman, and he should not marry a slave-girl
when he cannot aﬀord a freewoman unless he fears fornication. at
is in His Book, ‘If any of you who do not have the means to marry
believing free women (muḥṣanāt), you may marry believing slavegirls.’ (4:24). He says, ‘is is for those of you who are afraid of
committing al-‘anat.’”
Mālik said, “Al-‘anat is fornication.”

28.13 A man’s owning a slave whom he has married and then
divorced
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū ‘Abd

ar-Raḥmān that Zayd ibn ābit said that if a man divorced his
slave-girl three times and then bought her, she was not lawful for
him until she had married another husband.
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab and Sulaymān ibn Yasār were asked whether, when a
man married a slave of his to a slave-girl and the slave divorced her
irrevocably, and then her master gave her to the slave, she was then
lawful for the slave by virtue of ownership. ey said, “No, she is not
lawful until she has married another husband.”

32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had asked Ibn Shihāb

about a man who had a slave-girl as a wife, and then he bought her
and divorced her once. He said, “She is lawful for him by virtue of
ownership as long as he does not make his divorce irrevocable. If he
395

irrevocably divorces her, she is not lawful for him by virtue of
ownership until she has married another husband.”
Mālik said that if a man married a female slave and then she had a
child by him and then he bought her, she was not an umm walad for
him because of the child born to him while she belonged to another
until she had had a child by him while she was in his possession
after he had purchased her.
Mālik said, “If he buys her when she is pregnant by him and she
then gives birth while she belongs to him, she is his umm walad by
virtue of that pregnancy according to what we think, and Allah
knows best.”

28.14 Reprehensibility of intercourse with two sisters or a mother
and daughter that one owns
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from
‘Ubaydullāh ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd from his father that
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb was asked about a woman and her daughter
who were both owned, and whether one could have intercourse with
one of them after the other. ‘Umar said, “I dislike both being
permitted together.” He then forbade that.
33

34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Qabīṣa

ibn Dhū‘ayb that a man asked ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān whether one
could have intercourse with two sisters whom one owned. ‘Uthmān
said, “One āyat makes them lawful, and one āyat makes them
unlawful. As for me, I would not like to do it.” e man left him
and met one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and
asked him about it, and he said, “Had I any authority and I found
someone who had done it, I would punish him as an example.”
Ibn Shihāb added, “I think that it was ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib.”
35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that az-

Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwām said the like of that.
396

Mālik said that if a man had sexual relations with a female slave that
he owned, and then he wanted to also have relations with her sister,
the sister was not lawful for the man until intercourse with the
slave-girl had been made unlawful for him by marriage, setting-free,
kitāba, or the like of that – for instance, if he had married her to his
slave or someone other than his slave.

28.15 Prohibition against intercourse with a slave-girl who
belonged to one’s father
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb gave his son a slave-girl and said, “Do not touch her, for
I have uncovered her.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn alMujabbar said that Sālim ibn ‘Abdullāh gave his son a slave-girl and
said, “Do not go near her, for I wanted her, and did not act towards
her.”
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Abū

Nahshal ibn al-Aswad said to al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad, “I saw a
slave-girl of mine uncovered in the moonlight, and so I sat on her as
a man sits on a woman. She said that she was menstruating, so I
stood up and have not gone near her after that. Can I give her to my
son to have intercourse with?” Al-Qāsim forbade that.
38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibrāhīm ibn Abī ‘Abla

from ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwān that he gave a slave-girl to a friend
of his, and later asked him about her. He said, “I intended to give
her to my son to do such-and-such with her.” ‘Abd al-Malik said,
“Marwān was more scrupulous than you. He gave a slave-girl to his
son, and then he said, ‘Do not go near her, for I have seen her leg
uncovered.’”

28.16 Prohibition against marrying slave-girls who are People of
the Book

397

Mālik said, “It is not lawful to marry a Christian or Jewish slave-girl
because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in His Book, ‘So are
chaste women (muḥṣanāt) from among the believers and women
who are muḥṣanāt among those given the Book before you,’ (5:6),
and they are freewomen from the Christians and Jews. Allah, the
Blessed, the Exalted, says in His Book, ‘If any of you who do not
have the means to marry believing free women (muḥṣanāt), you may
marry believing slave-girls.’ (4:24).’”
Mālik said, “In our opinion, Allah made marriage to believing slavegirls lawful, but He did not make lawful marriage to Christian and
Jewish slave-girls from the People of the Book.”
Mālik said, “Christian and Jewish slave-girls are lawful for their
master by right of possession, but intercourse with a Magian slavegirl is not lawful by the right of possession.”

28.17 Muḥsanāt
39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab said, “e muḥṣanāt among women are those who
have husbands.” at referred to the fact that Allah has made
fornication ḥarām.
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb, and he had

heard from al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad that they said, “When a
freeman marries a slave-girl and consummates the marriage, she
makes him a muḥṣan.”

Mālik said, “All (of the people of knowledge) I have seen have said
that a slave-girl makes a freeman muḥṣan when he marries her and
consum-mates the marriage.”
Mālik said, “A slave makes a freewoman muḥṣana when he
consummates a marriage with her, but a freewoman only makes a
slave muḥṣan when he has been set free and he is her husband and
has had sexual relations with her after he has been set free. If he
parts from her before he is free, he is not a muḥṣan unless he
398

marries her after having been set free and he consummates the
marriage.”
Mālik said, “When a slave-girl is married to a freeman and then he
separates from her before she is set free, his marriage to her does
not make her muḥṣana. She is not muḥṣana until she has married
after she has been set free and she has had intercourse with her
husband. is accords her the iḥṣān status. If she is the wife of a
freeman and then she is set free while she is his wife before he
separates from her, the man makes her muḥṣana if he has
intercourse with her after she has been set free.”
Mālik said, “Christian and Jewish freewomen and Muslim slavegirls all render a Muslim freeman muḥṣān when he marries one of
them and has intercourse with her.”

28.18 Temporary marriage
41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Abdullāh

and Ḥasan, the sons of Muḥammad ibn ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib, from
their father g that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade temporary
marriage with women, and the ﬂesh of domestic donkeys, on the
Day of Khaybar.

42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr that Khawla ibn Ḥakīm came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb
and said, “Rabi‘a ibn Umayya contracted a temporary marriage with
a woman and she is pregnant by him.” ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb went
out in dismay dragging his cloak, saying, “is temporary marriage,
had I come across it, I would have ordered stoning and done away
with it!”

28.19 Marriage of slaves
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard Rabi‘a ibn ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān say that a slave could marry four women.

Mālik said, “is is the best of what I have heard about the matter.”
399

Mālik said, “e slave diﬀers with the muḥallil if the slave is given
permission by his master for his ex-wife. If his master does not give
him permission, he separates them. e muḥallil is separated in any
case if he merely intends to make the woman lawful [for her prior
husband] by virtue of marriage.”
Mālik said, “When a slave is owned by his wife, or a husband owns
his wife, the act of possession by either of them renders marriage
void without divorce. If a man, for instance, is married to a slavegirl, and then he buys her, he must divorce her as a matter of course.
ey can then re-marry. If they re-marry afterwards, that separation
was not divorce.”
Mālik said, “When a slave is freed by his wife who owns him and
she is in the ‘idda-period from him, they can only return to each
other after she has contracted another marriage.”

28.20 e marriage of idolators when their wives become Muslim
before them
44 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb that he had heard that in
the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬women were becoming

Muslim in their own lands, and they did not do hijra while their
husbands were still unbelievers, although they themselves had
become Muslim. Among them was the daughter of al-Walīd ibn alMughīra; she was the wife of Ṣafwān ibn Umayya. She became
Muslim on the day that Makka was conquered, and her husband,
Ṣafwān ibn Umayya, ﬂed from Islam. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
sent Ṣafwān‘s paternal cousin, Wahb ibn ‘Umayr with the cloak of
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬as a safe-conduct for Ṣafwān ibn
Umayya, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬called him to Islam and
asked for him to come to him and if he was pleased with the matter
to accept it. If not, he would have a respite for two months.
When Ṣafwān came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬with his cloak, he
called out to him over the heads of the people, “Muḥammad! Wahb
ibn ‘Umayr brought me your cloak and claimed that you had
400

summoned me to come to you and if I was pleased with the matter,
I should accept it and if not, you would give me a respite for two
months.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Come down, Abu
Wahb.” He said, “No, by Allah! I will not come down until you
make it clear to me!” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “You have a
respite of four months.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬went to meet
the Hawāzin at Ḥunayn. He sent to Ṣafwān ibn Umayya to borrow
some equipment and arms that he had. Ṣafwān said, “Willingly or
unwillingly?” He said, “Willingly.” erefore he lent him the
equipment and arms which he had. en Ṣafwān went out with the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬while he was still an unbeliever. He was
present at the Battles of Ḥunayn and at-Ṭā’if while he was still an
unbeliever and his wife was a Muslim. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
did not separate Ṣafwān and his wife until he had become Muslim,
and his wife remained with him by that marriage.
45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “ere was

about one month between the Islam of Ṣafwān and the Islam of his
wife.”
Ibn Shihāb said, “We have not heard about any woman doing hijra
for Allah and His Messenger while her husband was an unbeliever
abiding in the land of disbelief, but that her hijra separated her and
her husband, unless her husband came in hijra before her period of
‘idda had been completed.”
46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Umm

Ḥakīm bint al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām, who was the wife of ‘Ikrima ibn
Abī Jahl, became Muslim on the day that Makka was conquered,
and her husband ‘Ikrima ﬂed from Islam as far as the Yemen. Umm
Ḥakīm set out after him until she came to him in the Yemen and
she invited him to Islam, and he became Muslim. He went to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in the year of the Conquest (of Makka).
When the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, saw him, he rushed to him in joy
and did not bother to put on his cloak until he had received his
allegiance. e couple were conﬁrmed in their marriage.
401

Mālik said, “If a man becomes Muslim before his wife, a separation
occurs between them when he presents Islam to her and she does
not become Muslim, because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in
His Book, ‘Do not hold to any marriage ties with women who
reject.’ (60:10)”

28.21 e wedding feast
47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd aṭ-Ṭawīl from

Anas ibn Mālik that ‘Abd ar-Rahmān ibn ‘Awf came to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he had a trace of yellow on him. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked about it. He told him that he had just
been married. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked, “How much did
you hand over to her?” He replied, “e weight of a date pit in
gold.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Hold a feast, even if it is
only with a sheep.”
48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “I have
heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬held a wedding-feast in which

there was neither meat nor bread.”

49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When you are invited

to a wedding-feast, you must go to it.”

50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from al-A‘raj

that Abū Hurayra said, “e worst food is the food of a wedding
feast to which the rich are invited and the poor are left out. If
anyone rejects an invitation, he has rebelled against Allah and His
Messenger.”
51 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ishāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī

Ṭalḥa heard Anas ibn Mālik say that a certain tailor invited the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬to eat some food which he had prepared.

Anas said, “I went with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬to eat the food.
He served barley bread and a soup with pumpkin in it. I saw the
402

Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬going after the pumpkin around the dish, so
I have always liked pumpkin since that day.”

28.22 Marriage in general
52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When you marry a woman or buy a

slave-girl, take her by the forelock and ask for blessing. When you
buy a camel, take the top of its hump, and seek refuge with Allah
from Shayṭān.”
53 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zubayr al-Makkī

that somebody asked a man for his sister in marriage and the man
mentioned that she had committed fornication. ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb heard about it, and he beat the man or almost beat him,
and said, “What did you mean by giving him such information!”
54 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad and ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr
said that a man, who had four wives and then divorced one of them
irrevocably, could marry straightaway if he wished, and he did not
have to wait for the completion of her ‘idda.
55 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān

that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad and ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr gave the
same judgement to al-Walīd ibn ‘Abd al-Malik in the year of his
arrival in Madīna, except that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad said that
he divorced his wife on separate occasions (i.e. not at one time).
56 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab said, “ere are three things in which there is no
jest: marriage, divorce and setting-free.”
57 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Rāﬁ‘ ibn

Khadīj married the daughter of Muḥammad ibn Maslama alAnṣārī. She was with him until she grew older, and then he married
a young girl and preferred the young girl to her. She begged him to
divorce her, so he divorced her and then he gave her time until she
403

had almost ﬁnished her ‘idda period and then he returned and still
preferred the young girl. She therefore asked him to divorce her. He
divorced her once, and then returned to her, and still preferred the
young girl, and she asked him to divorce her. He said, “What do
you want? ere is only one divorce left. If you like, continue and
put up with what you see of preference, and if you like, I will
separate from you.” She said, “I will continue in spite of the
preference.” He kept her in spite of that, Rāﬁ‘ did not see that he
had done any wrong action when she remained with him in spite of
preference.

404

29. Divorce
29.1 e ‘irrevocable’ divorce
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that a man said

to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās, “I have divorced my wife by saying ‘I
divorce you a hundred times.’ What do you think my situation is?”
Ibn ‘Abbās said to him, “She was divorced from you by three
pronouncements, and by the ninety-seven you have mocked the
āyats of Allah.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that a man

came to ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd and said, “I have divorced my wife by
saying ‘I divorce you’ eight times.” Ibn Mas‘ūd said to him, “What
have people told you?” He replied, “I have been told that I have to
part absolutely from her.” Ibn Mas‘ūd said, “ey have spoken the
truth. If someone divorces in the way that Allah has said, Allah has
made it clear for him. But if someone makes matters confused for
himself, then we make him responsible for what he has made
confused. So do not confuse yourselves and then expect us to bear
the burden for you. It is as they have said.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Abū

Bakr ibn Ḥazm that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz had asked him what
people said about the ‘irrevocable’ divorce, and Abū Bakr had
replied that Abān ibn ‘Uthmān had clariﬁed that it was declared
only once. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz said, “Even if divorce had to be
declared a thousand times, the ‘irrevocable’ would use them all up. A
person who says ‘irrevocably’ has cast the furthest limit.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Marwān

ibn al-Ḥakam decided that if someone made three pronouncements
of divorce, he had divorced his wife irrevocably.

405

Mālik said, “at is what I like best of what I have heard on the
subject.”

29.2 Divorce by euphemistic statements
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb had heard in a letter from Iraq that a man had said to his
wife, “Your rein is on your withers” (i.e. you have free rein). ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb wrote to his governor to order the man to come to
him at Makka at the time of the ḥajj. While ‘Umar was doing ṭawāf
around the House, a man met him and greeted him. ‘Umar asked
him who he was, and he replied that he was the man that he had
ordered to be brought to him. ‘Umar said to him, “I ask you by the
Lord of this building, what did you mean by your statement, ‘Your
rein is on your withers’?” e man replied, “Had you made me swear
by other than this place, I would not have told you the truth. I
intended separation by that.” ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “It is what
you intended.”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Alī ibn

Abī Ṭālib used to say that if a man said to his wife, “You are
unlawful for me,” it counted as three pronouncements of divorce.
Mālik said, “at is the best of what I have heard on the subject.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said that the statement like, “I cut myself oﬀ from you,” or
“You are abandoned” were considered as three pronouncements of
divorce.

Mālik said that any strong statements such as these or others were
considered as three pronouncements of divorce for a woman whose
marriage had been consummated. In the case of a woman whose
marriage had not been consummated the man was asked to make an
oath on his dīn, as to whether he had intended one or three
pronouncements of divorce. If he had intended one pronouncement,
he was asked to make an oath by Allah to conﬁrm it, and he became
406

a suitor among her suitors, because a woman whose marriage had
been consummated, required three pronouncements of divorce to
make her inaccessible for the husband, whilst only one
pronouncement was needed to make a woman whose marriage had
not been consummated inaccessible.
Mālik added, “at is the best of what I have heard about the
matter.”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad that a certain man had taken a slave-girl
belonging to somebody else as a wife. He said to her people, “She is
your concern,” and people considered that to be one pronouncement
of divorce.
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard Ibn Shihāb say that

if a man said to his wife, “You are free of me, and I am free of you,”
it counted as three pronouncements of divorce as if it were an
‘irrevocable’ divorce.
Mālik said that if a man made any strong statement such as these to
his wife, it counted as three pronouncements of divorce for a woman
whose marriage had been consummated, or it was written as one of
three for a woman whose marriage had not been consummated,
whichever the man wished. If he said that he intended only one
divorce he swore to it and he became one of the suitors because,
whereas a woman whose marriage had been consummated was
made inaccessible by three pronouncements of divorce, the woman
whose marriage had not been consummated was made inaccessible
by only one pronouncement.
Mālik said, “at is the best of what I have heard.”

29.3 Giving wives the right of full divorce
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that a man

came to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar and said, “Abū ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān! I
placed the command of my wife in her hand, and she has divorced
407

herself from me, what do you think?” ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “I
think that it is as she said.” e man said, “Do not do it, Abū ‘Abd
ar-Raḥmān!” Ibn ‘Umar said, “You did it, it has nothing to do with
me.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “When a man gives a woman command over herself,
then the result is as she decides unless he denies it and says that he
only meant to give her one divorce and he swears to it – then he has
access to her while she is in her ‘idda.”

29.4 When a wife’s authority must be considered as only a single
pro-nouncement of divorce
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sa‘īd ibn Sulaymān ibn

Zayd ibn ābit that Khārija ibn Zayd ibn ābit told him that he
was sitting with Zayd ibn ābit when Muḥammad ibn Abī ‘Atīq
came to him with his eyes brimming with tears. Zayd asked him
what the matter was. He said, “I gave my wife command of herself,
and she separated from me.” Zayd said to him, “What made you do
that?” He said, “e Decree.” Zayd said, “Take her back if you wish
for it is only one pronouncement, and you have the right to her.”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim from his father that a man of aqīf gave his wife command
over herself, and she said, “You are divorced.” He was silent. She
said, “You are divorced.” He said, “May a stone be in your mouth.”
She said, “You are divorced.” He said, “May a stone be in your
mouth.” ey argued and went to Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam. Marwān
made him take an oath that he had only given her control over one
pronouncement, and then he gave her back to him.
Mālik said that ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān said that al-Qāsim was very
pleased with Marwān’s decision and thought it the best he had
heard on the subject.

408

Mālik added, “at is also the best of what I have heard on this
subject and I prefer it.”

29.5 When allowing a wife her authority does not constitute a
divorce
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim from his father that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, proposed to
Qurayba bint Abī Umayya on behalf of ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī
Bakr. ey married her to him and her people found fault with ‘Abd
ar-Raḥmān and said, “We only gave in marriage because of ‘Ā’isha.”
‘Ā’isha therefore sent to ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān and told him about it. He
gave Qurayba authority over herself and she chose her husband and
so there was no divorce.
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn alQāsim from his father that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬gave

Ḥafṣa bint ‘Abd ar-Rahmān in marriage to al-Mundhir ibn azZubayr while ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān was away in Syria. When ‘Abd arRaḥmān arrived, he said, “Shall someone like me have this done to
him? Am I the kind of man to have something done to him without
his consent?” ‘Ā’isha spoke to al-Mundhir ibn az-Zubayr, and alMundhir said, “It is in the hands of ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān.” ‘Abd arRaḥmān said, “I will not oppose something that you have already
completed.” Hafṣa was conﬁrmed with al-Mundhir, and there was
no divorce.
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Abdullāh

ibn ‘Umar and Abū Hurayra were asked about a man who gave his
wife power over herself, and she returned it to him without doing
anything with it. ey said that there was no divorce. (i.e. the man’s
giving his wife power over herself was not interpreted as an actual
expression of divorce on his part.)

409

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab said, “If a man gives his wife authority over herself,
and she does not separate from him and remains with him, there is
no divorce.”
Mālik said about a woman whose husband gave her power over
herself and they then separated while she refused to do that, that she
had no longer has power to invoke the divorce. She only had power
over herself as long as they remained together in the same meeting.

29.6 Annulment of marriage by the husband’s vow to refrain
from intercourse (īlā’)
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad from

his father that ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib said, “When a man takes a vow to
abstain from intercourse, divorce does not occur immediately. If four
months pass, he must declare his intent and either he is divorced or
he revokes his vow.”
Mālik said, “at is what is done among us.”
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “When a man makes a vow to abstain from intercourse
with his wife, and four months have passed, he must declare his
intent and either he is divorced or he revokes his vow. Divorce does
not occur until four months have passed and he is made to declare
his intent.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab and Abū Bakr ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān said about a man
who made a vow to abstain from intercourse with his wife, “If four
months pass it is a divorce. e husband can go back to his wife as
long as she is still in her ‘idda.”
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Marwān

ibn al-Ḥakam decided about a man who had made a vow to abstain
from intercourse with his wife that when four months had passed, it
410

was a divorce but he could return to her as long as she was still in
her ‘idda.
Mālik added, “at was also the opinion of Ibn Shihāb.”
Mālik said that if a man made a vow to abstain from intercourse
with his wife and at the end of four months he declared his intent to
continue to abstain, he was divorced. He could go back to his wife,
but if he did not have intercourse with her before the end of her
‘idda, he had no access to her and could not go back to her unless he
had an excuse: illness, imprisonment, or a similar excuse. His return
to her maintained her as his wife. If her ‘idda passed and then he
married her after that and did not have intercourse with her until
four months had passed and he declared his intent to continue to
abstain, divorce was applied to him by the ﬁrst vow. If four months
passed, and he had not returned to her, he had no ‘idda against her
nor access because he had married her and then divorced her before
touching her.
Mālik said that a man who made a vow to abstain from intercourse
from his wife and continued to abstain after four months and so
divorced her, but then took her back but did not touch her and four
months were completed before her ‘idda was completed, did not
have to declare his intent and divorce did not befall him. If he had
intercourse with her before the end of her ‘idda, he was entitled to
her. If her ‘idda passed before he had intercourse with her, then he
had no access to her.
Mālik said, “is is the best that I have heard about this matter.”
Mālik said that if a man made a vow to abstain from intercourse
with his wife and then divorced her, and the four months of the vow
were completed before completion of the ‘idda of the divorce, it
counted as two pronouncements of divorce. If he declared his
intention to continue to abstain and the ‘idda of the divorce ﬁnished
before the four months, the vow of abstention was not a divorce.

411

at was because the four months had passed and she was not his
on that day.
Mālik said, “If someone makes a vow not to have sexual intercourse
with his wife for a day or a month, and then waits until more than
four months have passed, it is not īlā’. Īlā’ only applies to someone
who vows more than four months. As for the one who vows not to
have intercourse with his wife for four months or less than that, I do
not think that it is īlā’ because when the term enters into it at which
it stops, he comes out of his oath and he does not have to declare his
intention.”
Mālik said, “If someone vows to his wife not to have intercourse
with her until her child has been weaned, that is not īlā’. I have
heard that ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib was asked about that and he did not
think that it amounted to īlā’.”

29.7 e īlā’ (vow of abstention) of slaves
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had asked Ibn Shihāb about
the īlā’ of the slave. He said that it was like the īlā’ of the freeman
and it put an obligation on him. e īlā’ of the slave was two
months.

29.8 Ẓihār of freemen
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sa‘īd ibn ‘Amr ibn Sulaym

az-Zuraqī that he asked al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad about a man
who made divorce conditional on his marrying a woman (i.e. if he
married her he would automatically divorce her.) Al-Qāsim ibn
Muḥammad said, “A man once made a woman like his mother‘s
back, (i.e. has made unlawful for him by ẓihār) if he were to marry
her, and ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb ordered him not to go near her if he
married her until he had done kaﬀāra as one would for pronouncing
ẓihār.”
412

21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that a man

asked al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad and Sulaymān ibn Yasar about a
man who pronounced ẓihār from his wife before he had married her.
ey said, “If he marries her, he must not touch her until he has
done the kaﬀāra for pronouncing ẓihār.”

22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father said that a man who pronounced a ẓihār from his four wives
in one statement had only to do one kaﬀāra.
Yaḥyā related the same as that to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn
Abī ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān.

Mālik said, “at is what is done among us. Allah, the Exalted, says
about the kaﬀāra for pronouncing ẓihār, ‘Anyone who cannot ﬁnd
the means must fast for two consecutive months before the two of
them may touch one another again. And anyone who is unable to do
that must feed sixty poor people.’” (58:3-4)
Mālik said that a man who pronounced ẓihār from his wife on
various occasions had only to do one kaﬀāra. If he pronounced
ẓihār, and then did kaﬀāra, and then pronounced ẓihār after he had
done the kaﬀāra, he had to do kaﬀāra again.
Mālik said, “Someone who pronounces ẓihār from his wife and then
has intercourse with her before he has done kaﬀāra, only has to do
one kaﬀāra. He must abstain from her until he has completed the
kaﬀāra and ask forgiveness of Allah. at is the best of what I have
heard.”
Mālik said, “It is the same with ẓihār using any prohibited relations
of either fosterage or ancestry.”
Mālik said, “Women cannot pronounce ẓihār.”
Mālik said that he had heard that the commentary on the word of
Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, “ose who divorce their wives by
equating them with their mothers, and then wish to go back on
413

what they said” (56:3), was that a man pronounced ẓihār on his wife
and then decided to keep her and have intercourse with her. If he
divorced her and, without having, after pronouncing ẓihār on her,
decided to keep her and have intercourse with her, there would be
no kaﬀāra incumbent on him.
Mālik said, “If he marries her after that, he does not touch her until
he has completed the kaﬀāra of pronouncing ẓihār.”
Mālik said that if a man who pronounced ẓihār from his slave-girl
wanted to have intercourse with her, he had to do the kaﬀāra of the
ẓihār before he could sleep with her.
Mālik said, “ere is no īlā’ in a man’s ẓihār unless it is evident that
he does not intend to retract his ẓihār.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that he

heard a man ask ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr about a man who said to his
wife, “Any woman I marry along with you as long as you live will be
like my mother’s back to me.” ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said, “Freeing a
slaves is enough to release him from that.”

29.9 Ẓihār done by slaves
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he asked Ibn Shihāb about

the ẓihār of a slave. He said, “It is like the ẓihār of a freeman.”

Mālik said, “He meant that the same conditions were applied in
both cases.”
Mālik said, “e ẓihār of the slave is incumbent on him, and the
fasting of the slave in the ẓihār is two months.”
Mālik said that there was no īlā’ for a slave who pronounced a ẓihār
from his wife. at was because if he were to fast the kaﬀāra for
pronouncing a ẓihār, the divorce of the īlā’ would come to him
before he had ﬁnished the fast.

29.10 e option (of slave-girls married to slaves when freed)
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān from al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad that ‘Ā’isha, Umm alMu’minīn, said, “ere were three sunnas established in connection
with Barīra: ﬁrstly was that when she was set free she was given her
choice about her husband; secondly, the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said
about her, ‘e right of inheritance belongs to the person who has
set a person free’; and thirdly, the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came in
and there was a pot with meat on the boil. Bread and condiments
were brought to him from the stock of the house. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Did I not see a pot with meat in it?’ ey said, ‘Yes,
Messenger of Allah. at is meat which was given as ṣadaqa for
Barīra, and you do not eat ṣadaqa.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘It is ṣadaqa for her, and it is a gift for us.’”
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said that a female slave who was the wife of a slave and then
was set free had the right of choice as long as he did not have
intercourse with her.
Mālik said, “If her husband has intercourse with her and she claims
that she did not know, she still has the right of choice. If she is
suspect and one does not believe her claim of ignorance, then she
has no choice after he has had intercourse with her.”
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr that a mawlā of the tribe of Banū ‘Adī called Zabrā’ told
him that she had been the wife of a slave when she was a slave-girl.
en she was set free and she sent a message to Ḥafṣa, the wife of
the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬. Ḥafṣa called her and said, “I will tell you something,
but I would prefer that you did not act upon it. You have authority
over yourself as long as your husband does not have intercourse with
you. If he has intercourse with you, you have no authority at all.”
erefore she pronounced her divorce from him three times.

415

28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab said that if a man married a woman, and he was insane
or had a physical defect, she had the right of choice. If she wished
she could separate from him.

29 Mālik said that if a slave-girl, who was the wife of a slave, was set

free before he had consummated the marriage, and she chose
herself, then she had no bride-price and it was a pronouncement of
divorce.
Mālik said, “at is what is done among us.”
30 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik heard Ibn Shihāb say, “When a

man gives his wife the right of choice, and she chooses him, that is
not divorce.”
Mālik said, “at is the best of what I have heard.”
Mālik said that if a woman who had been given the right of choice
by her husband chose herself, she was divorced trebly. If her
husband said, “But I only gave her the right of divorce in one,” he
was not allowed to do that.
Mālik said, “If the man gives his wife the right of choice and she
says, ‘I accept one’, and he says, ‘I did not mean that. I have given
the right of choice in all three together,’ then if she only accepts one,
she remains with him in her marriage, and that is not separation if
Allah, the Exalted, wills.”

29.11 Separating from wives for compensation (khul‘)
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Amra

bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān told him from Ḥabība bint Sahl al-Anṣārī that
she had been married to ābit ibn Qays ibn Shammās. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬went out for the Dawn Prayer, and found
Ḥabība bint Sahl at his door in the darkness. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked her, “Who is this?” She said, “I am Ḥabība bint Sahl,
Messenger of Allah.” He asked, “What do you want?” She replied,
416

“at ābit ibn Qays and I separate.” When her husband, ābit
ibn Qays, came, the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him, “is is
Ḥabība bint Sahl. She has mentioned what Allah willed that she
mention.” Ḥabība said, “Messenger of Allah, I have all that he has
given me!” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to ābit ibn Qays,
“Take it from her.” He took it from her and she stayed in the house
of her family.
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from a mawlā of

Ṣaﬁyya bint Abī ‘Ubayd that she gave all that she possessed to her
husband as compensation for her divorce from him, and ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Umar did not disapprove of that.

Mālik said that the divorce was ratiﬁed for a woman who ransomed
herself from her husband, when it was known that her husband was
injurious to her and was oppressive to her and it was known that he
wronged her, and he had to return her property to her.
Mālik added, “at is what I have heard, and it is what is done
among us.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm if a woman ransoms herself from her
husband for more than he gave her.”

29.12 e khul‘ divorce
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Rubayyi‘ bint

Mu‘awwidh ibn ‘Afrā’ came with her paternal uncle to ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar and told him that she had been divorced from her husband
by compensating him in the time of ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān, and
‘Uthmān heard about it and did not disapprove.
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “Her ‘idda is the ‘idda of a divorced
woman.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab and Sulaymān ibn Yasār and Ibn Shihāb all said that a
417

woman who divorced her husband for compensation had the same
‘idda as a divorced woman: three menstrual periods.
Mālik said that a woman who ransomed herself could not return to
her husband except by a new marriage. If he then married her
(again) and then separated from her before he had had intercourse
with her, there was no ‘idda for her to observe from her second
divorce, and she continued on from when her ﬁrst ‘idda stopped.
Mālik said, “at is the best that I have heard on the matter.”
Mālik said, “If, when a woman oﬀers to compensate her husband,
he divorces her straightaway, then that compensation is conﬁrmed
for him. If he makes no response and then at a later date does
divorce her, he is not entitled to that compensation.”

29.13 Li‘ān (invoking mutual curses)
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sahl ibn

Sa‘īd as-Sā‘idī told him that ‘Uwaymir al-‘Ajlānī came to ‘Āsim ibn
‘Adī al-Ansārī and said to him, “‘Āsim! What do you think a man
who ﬁnds another man with his wife should do? Should he kill him
and then be killed himself, or what should he do, ‘Āsim? Ask the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about that for me.” ‘Asim asked the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about it. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was
revolted by the questions and reproved them until what ‘Āsim heard
from the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬became too much for him to bear.
When ‘Āsim returned to his people, ‘Uwaymir came to him and
said, “‘Āsim! What did the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say to you?”
‘Āsim said to ‘Uwaymir, “You did not bring me any good. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was revolted by the question which I asked
him.” ‘Uwaymir said, “By Allah! I will not stop until I ask him
about it myself!” ‘Uwaymir stood up and went to the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in the middle of the people and said, “Messenger of Allah!
What do you think a man who ﬁnds another man with his wife
should do? Should he kill him and then be killed himself, or what
418

should he do?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said. “Something has
been sent down about you and your wife, so go and bring her.”
Sahl continued, “ey engaged in the process of li‘ān in the presence
of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and I was present with the people.
When they ﬁnished the process of li‘ān, ‘Uwaymir said, ‘I shall have
lied about her, Messenger of Allah, if I keep her,’ and pronounced
the divorce three times before the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered
him to do it.”
Mālik said that Ibn Shihāb said, “at then became the sunna for a
couple engaging in the process of li‘ān.”
35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar that a man engaged in the process of li‘ān with his wife in the
time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and disowned her child. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬separated them and gave the child to the
woman.
Mālik said, “Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, says, ‘ose who make
an accusation against their wives and have no witnesses except
themselves, the legal proceeding of such a one is to testify four times
by Allah that he is telling the truth and a ﬁfth time that Allah’s
curse will be upon him if he is lying. And the punishment is
removed from her if she testiﬁes four times by Allah that he is lying
and a ﬁfth time that Allah’s anger will be upon her if he speaks the
truth.’” (24:6-9)
Mālik said, “e sunna with us is that those who engage in the
process of li‘ān are never to be remarried. If the man calls himself a
liar (i.e. takes back his accusation), he is ﬂogged with the ḥadd
punishment, and the child is attributed to him, and his wife can
never return to him. ere is no doubt or dispute about this sunna
among us.”
Mālik said, “If a man separates from his wife by an irrevocable
divorce after which he cannot take her back, and then denies the
419

paternity of the child she is carrying whilst she claims that he is the
father, and it is possible by the timing that he is the father, then he
must engage in the process of li‘ān with her, so that there is no
acknowledgement that the pregnancy is by him.”
Mālik said, “at is what is done among us, and it is what I have
heard from the people of knowledge.”
Mālik said that a man who accused his wife after he had divorced
her triply while she was pregnant, and he had at ﬁrst accepted being
the father but then claimed that he had seen her committing
adultery before he separated from her, was ﬂogged with the ḥadd
punishment, and did not engage in the process of li‘ān with her.
If he denied the paternity of her child after he had divorced her
triply, and he had not previously accepted it, then he engaged in the
process of li‘ān with her.
Mālik said, “is is what I have heard.”
Mālik said, “e slave is in the same position as the freeman as
regards making accusations and engaging in the process of li‘ān. He
acts in the li‘ān as the freeman acts although no ḥadd applies for
slandering a female slave.”
Mālik said, “e Muslim slave-girl and the Christian and Jewish
freewoman also engage in the process of li‘ān when a free Muslim
marries one of them and has intercourse with her. at is because
Allah – may He be blessed and exalted, says in His Book, ‘ose
who make an accusation against their wives,’ and they are their
wives. is is what is done among us.”
Mālik said, “If a slave marries a free Muslim woman, or a Muslim
slave-girl, or a free Christian or Jewish woman, he can engage in the
process of li‘ān with her.”
Mālik said that if a man engaged in the process of li‘ān with his
wife, and then stopped and called himself a liar after one or two
420

oaths without having asked for curses on himself in the ﬁfth one, he
should be ﬂogged with the ḥadd punishment [for slander], but they
did not have to be separated.
Mālik said that if a man divorced his wife and then after three
months the woman said, “I am pregnant,” and he denied paternity,
then he had to do li‘ān.
Mālik said that the husband of a female slave who engaged in the
process of li‘ān with her and then bought her was not to have
intercourse with her, even if he owned her, and the sunna which had
been handed down about a couple who engaged in the process of
li‘ān was that they were never to return to each other.
Mālik said that when a man engaged in the process of li‘ān with his
wife before he had consummated the marriage, she only had half of
the bride-price.

29.14 Inheritance of children of women against whom li‘ān has
been pronounced
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr said that if the child of a woman against whom li‘ān had
been pronounced or the child of fornication died, his mother
inherited from him her right as mentioned in the Book of Allah the
Exalted, and his maternal half-brothers had their rights. e rest
was inherited by the owners of his mother’s walā’ if she was a freed
slave. If she was an ordinary freewoman, she inherited her right, his
maternal brothers inherited their rights, and the rest went to the
Muslims.”
Mālik said, “I heard the same as that from Sulaymān ibn Yasār, and
it is what I have seen the people of knowledge in our city doing.”

29.15 Divorce of virgins
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from
Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn awbān that Muḥammad
37

421

ibn Iyās ibn al-Bukayr said, “A man divorced his wife three times
before he had consummated the marriage, and then it seemed good
to him to marry her. He wanted, therefore, an opinion, and I went
with him to ask ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās and Abū Hurayra on his
behalf about it, and they said, ‘We do not think that you should
marry her until she has married another husband.’ He protested that
his divorcing her had been only once. Ibn ‘Abbās said, ‘You threw
away what you had of blessing.’”
38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Bukayr ibn ‘Abdullāh al-Ashajj from an-Nu‘mān ibn Abī ‘Ayyāsh alAnṣārī from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār that a man came and asked ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ about a man who divorced his wife three times
before he had had intercourse with her. ‘Aṭā’ said, “e divorce of
the virgin is one. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Āṣ said to me, ‘You say
one pronouncement completely separates her from her husband and
three makes her unlawful until she has married another husband.’”
39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

Bukayr ibn ‘Abdullāh al-Ashajj informed him that Mu‘āwiya ibn
Abī ‘Ayyāsh al-Anṣārī told him that he was sitting with ‘Abdullāh
ibn az-Zubayr and ‘Āṣim ibn ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb when
Muḥammad ibn Iyās ibn al-Bukayr came up to them and said, “A
man from the desert has divorced his wife three times before
consummating the marriage. What do you think?” ‘Abdullāh ibn
az-Zubayr said, “is is something about which we have no
statement. Go to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās and Abū Hurayra. I left
them with ‘Ā’isha. Ask them and then come and tell us.” He went
and asked them. Ibn ‘Abbās said to Abū Hurayra, “Give an opinion,
Abū Hurayra! A diﬃcult one has come to you.” Abū Hurayra said,
“One pronouncement separates her and three makes her unlawful
until she has married another husband.” Ibn ‘Abbās said something
similar to that.
Mālik said, “at is what is done among us, and when a man
marries a woman who has been married before, and he has not had
422

intercourse with her, she is treated as a virgin – one pronouncement
separates her and three make her unlawful until she has married
another husband.”

29.16 Divorce of sick men
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Talha ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Awf said, and he knew better than them, from Abū
Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf that ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf
divorced his wife irrevocably while he was terminally ill and
‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān made her an heir after the end of her ‘idda.
41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn al-Faḍl from

al-A‘raj that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān made the wives of Ibn Mukmil
inherit from him, and he had divorced them while he was terminally
ill.
42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard Rabi‘a ibn Abī

‘Abd ar-Raḥmān say, “I heard that the wife of ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn
‘Awf asked him to divorce her. He said, ‘When you have
menstruated and are pure, then let me know.’ She did not
menstruate until ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf was ill. When she was
puriﬁed, she told him and he divorced her irrevocably or made a
pronouncement of divorce which was all that he had left over her.
‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf was terminally ill at the time, so ‘Uthmān
ibn ‘Aﬀān made her one of the heirs after the end of her ‘idda.”
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān said, “My grandfather Ḥabbān
had two wives, one from the Banū Hāshim and one from the Ansār.
He divorced the Anṣārī wife while she was nursing, and a year
passed and he died and she had still not menstruated. She said, ‘I
inherit from him. I have not menstruated yet.’ e wives quarrelled
and went to ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān. He decided that she did inherit
and the Hāshim wife rebuked ‘Uthmān. He said, ‘is is the
practice of the son of your paternal uncle. He pointed this out to us.’
He meant ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib.”
423

44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard Ibn Shihāb

say, “When a man who is terminally ill divorces his wife three times,
she still inherits from him.”
Mālik said, “If he divorces her while he is terminally ill before he
has consummated the marriage, she has half of the bride-price and
inherits, and she does not have to do an ‘idda. If he has
consummated the marriage, she has all the dowry and inherits. e
virgin and the previously married woman are the same in this
situation according to us.”

29.17 Compensatory gift after divorce
45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf divorced his wife, and gave her a compensatory
gift in the form of a slave-girl.
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar said, “Every divorced woman has compensation except for
the one who is divorced and is allocated a bride-price and has not
been touched. She receives half of what was allocated to her.”
46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “Every

divorced woman receives compensation.”

Mālik said, “I have also heard the same as that from al-Qāsim ibn
Muḥammad.”
Mālik said, “ere is no ﬁxed limit among us as to how small or
large the compensation is.”

29.18 e divorce of a slave
47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from

Sulaymān ibn Yasār that Nufay‘, a mukātab of Umm Salama, the
wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, or a slave of hers, had a freewoman as a wife.
He divorced her twice, and then he wanted to return to her. e
wives of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬ordered him to go to ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān to
424

ask him about it. He found him at ad-Daraj with Zayd ibn ābit.
He asked them, and they both replied to him immediately and said,
“She is unlawful for you. She is unlawful for you.”
48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab that Nufay‘, a mukātab of Umm Salama, the wife of
the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬divorced his free wife twice, so he asked ‘Uthmān
ibn ‘Aﬀān for an opinion, and he said, “She is unlawful for you.”
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdu Rabbih ibn Sa‘īd

from Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī that Nufay‘,
a mukātab of Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬asked Zayd
ibn ābit for an opinion. He said, “I have divorced my free wife
twice.” Zayd ibn ābit said, “She is unlawful for you.”
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “When a slave divorces his wife twice, she is unlawful
for him until she has married another husband, whether she is free
or a slave. e ‘idda of a free woman is three menstrual periods, and
the ‘idda of a slave-girl is two periods.”
51 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “If a man gives his slave permission to marry, the
divorce is in the hand of the slave, and nobody else has any power
over his divorce. Nothing is held against a man who takes the slavegirl of his male slave or the slave-girl of his female slave.”

29.19 Maintenance of slave-girls divorced when pregnant
Mālik said, “Neither a freeman nor a slave who divorces a slave-girl
nor a slave who divorces a freewoman, in an irrevocable divorce, is
obliged to pay maintenance even if she is pregnant and he no longer
has any right to return to her.”
Mālik said, “A freeman is not obliged to pay for the suckling of his
son when his son is a slave belonging to others, nor is a slave obliged
to spend his money on what his master owns except with the
permission of his master.”
425

29.20 ‘Idda of women with missing husbands
52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “e woman who
loses her husband and does not know where he is waits for four
years, then does ‘idda for four months, and then she is free to
marry.”
Mālik said, “If she marries after her ‘idda is over, regardless of
whether the new husband has consummated the marriage or not,
her ﬁrst husband has no means of access to her.”
Mālik said, “at is what is done among us. If her husband reaches
her before she has re-married, he is more entitled to her.”
Mālik said that he had seen people disapproving of what one person
said that one of the people (i.e. one of the people of knowledge) had
attributed to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb that he had said, “Her ﬁrst
husband chooses when he comes: either her bride-price or his wife.”
Mālik said, “I have heard that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, speaking about
a woman whose husband divorced her while he was absent from her
and then took her back, and the news of his taking her back had not
reached her while the news of his divorcing her had, and so she had
married again, said, ‘Her ﬁrst husband who divorced her has no
means of access to her whether or not the new husband has
consummated the marriage.’
Mālik said, “is is what I like best of what I have heard about the
missing man.”

29.21 ‘Idda of divorce and divorce of menstruating women
53 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating in the time of
the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb asked the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about it. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“Go and tell him to take her back and keep her until she is puriﬁed
426

and then has a period and then is puriﬁed. en if he wishes, he can
keep her, and if he wishes, he should divorce her before he has had
intercourse with her. at is the ‘idda which Allah has commanded
for women who are divorced.”
54 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr from ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, that she took Ḥafṣa ibn
‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddiq into her house when she
had entered the third period of her ‘idda. Ibn Shihāb said, “at was
mentioned to ‘Amra bint ‘Abd ar ar-Raḥmān, and she said that
‘Urwa had spoken the truth and people had argued with ‘Ā’isha
about it, saying that Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in His
Book, ‘ree qurū’.’ ‘Ā’isha said, ‘You spoken the truth. Do you
know what qurū’ are? qurū’ are times of becoming pure after
menstruation.”
55 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said that he

heard Abū Bakr ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān say, “I have never seen any of
our fuqahā’ who did not say that this was what the statement of
‘Ā’isha meant.”
56 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ and Zayd ibn Aslam

from Sulaymān ibn Yasār that al-Aḥwaṣ died in Syria when his wife
had begun her third menstrual period after he had divorced her.
Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān wrote and asked Zayd ibn ābit about
that. Zayd wrote to him, “When she began her third period, she
was free from him and he was free from her. He does not inherit
from her nor she from him.”
57 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Abū Bakr

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān, Sulaymān ibn Yasār and Ibn Shihāb used to
say, “When a divorced woman enters the beginning of her third
period, she is clearly separated from her husband and she cannot
inherit from him and he cannot inherit from her and he has no
access to her.”

427

58 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “When a man divorces his wife and she begins her third
period, she is free from him and he is free from her.”
Mālik said, “is is how things are done among us.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from al-Fuḍayl ibn Abī
‘Abdullāh, the mawlā of al-Mahrī that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad
and Sālim ibn ‘Abdullāh said, “When a woman is divorced and
begins her third period, she is clearly separated from him and is free
to marry again.”
59

60 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab, Ibn Shihāb, and Sulaymān ibn Yasār all said, “e
‘idda of a woman in a khul‘ divorce is three periods.”
61 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard Ibn Shihāb say,

“e ‘idda of a divorced woman is reckoned by the menstrual cycles
even if she is estranged.” (e reason the ‘idda is normally reckoned
by the menstrual cycle is to see whether the woman is pregnant or
not.)
62 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from a

man of the Anṣār that his wife asked him for a divorce, and he said
to her, “When you have had your period, then tell me.” When she
had her period, she told him. He said, “When you are puriﬁed then
tell me.” When she was puriﬁed, she told him and he divorced her.
Mālik said, “is is the best of what I have heard about it.”

29.22 ‘Idda of women in their houses when divorced in them
63 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad and Sulaymān ibn Yasār both mention that
Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd ibn al-‘Āṣ divorced the daughter of ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān
ibn al-Hakam irrevocably, so ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Hakam took
her away. ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, sent to Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam
428

who was the governor of Madīna at that time. She said, “Fear Allah
and make him return the woman to her house.”
Marwān said in what Sulaymān related, “‘Abd ar-Raḥmān has the
upper hand over me.” Marwān said in what al-Qāsim related, “Have
you not heard about the aﬀair of Fāṭima bint Qays?” ‘Ā’isha said, “It
will not harm you to mention the story of Fāṭima.” Marwān said, “If
you see some evil, there is enough evil in what occurred between
those two.” (see ḥadīth 67)
64 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that the daughter of

Sa‘īd ibn Zayd ibn ‘Amr ibn Nufayl was the wife of ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Amr ibn ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān, and he divorced her irrevocably and
she moved out. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar rebuked her for that.
65 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar divorced one of his wives in the house of Ḥafṣa, the wife of
the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬. It was on his way to the mosque so he went by a
diﬀerent route which went behind the houses as he was averse to
asking her permission to enter until he took her back.
66 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab was asked who was obliged to pay the rent for a
woman whose husband divorced her while she was in a leased
house. Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said, “Her husband is obliged to pay
it.” Someone asked, “What if her husband does not have it?” He
said, “en she must pay it.” Someone asked, “And if she does not
have it?” He said, “en the ruler must pay it.”

29.23 Maintenance of divorced women
67 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Yazīd, the

mawlā of al-Aswad ibn Sufyān from Abū Salama ibn ‘Abd arRaḥmān ibn ‘Awf from Fāṭima bint Qays that Abū ‘Amr ibn Ḥafṣ
divorced her absolutely while he was away in Syria. His agent sent
her some barley and she was displeased with it, saying, “By Allah, I
don’t expect anything from you.” She went to the Messenger of
429

Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and mentioned it to him. He said, “You have no
maintenance. He then ordered her to spend her ‘idda in the house
of Umm Sharīk. en he said, “is is a woman whom my
Companions visit. Spend the ‘idda in the house of ‘Abdullāh Ibn
Umm Maktum. He is a blind man and you can undress in his home.
When you are free to marry, tell me.”
She continued, “When I was free to remarry, I mentioned to him
that Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān and Abū Jahm ibn Hishām had asked
for me in marriage. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘As for Abū
Jahm, he never puts down his stick from his shoulder (i.e. he is
always travelling), and as for Mu‘āwiya, he is a poor man with no
property. Marry Usāma ibn Zayd.’ I objected to him and he
repeated, ‘Marry Usāma ibn Zayd.’ So I married him, and Allah put
good in it and I was content with him.’”
68 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard Ibn Shihāb say, “A

woman who is absolutely divorced does not leave her house until she
is free to remarry. She is not entitled to maintenance unless she is
pregnant. In that case the husband supports her until she gives
birth.”
Mālik said, “is is what is done among us.”

29.24 ‘Idda of slave-girls divorced by their husbands
69 Mālik said, “What is done among us when a slave divorces a

slave-girl when she is a slave and then she is set free, is that her
‘idda is the ‘idda of a slave-girl, and her being set free does not
change her ‘idda, whether or not he can still take her back. Her
‘idda is not altered.”
Mālik said, “e ḥadd punishment which a slave incurs is treated in
the same way. When he is freed after he has incurred the penalty
but before the punishment has been executed, his ḥadd is the ḥadd
of a slave.”

430

Mālik said, “A freeman can divorce a slave-girl three times, and her
‘idda is two periods. A slave divorces a freewoman twice, and her
‘idda is three periods.”
Mālik said about a man who had a slave-girl as a wife, and he
bought her and set her free, “Her ‘idda is the ‘idda of a slave-girl,
i.e. two periods, as long as he has not had intercourse with her. If he
has had intercourse with her after buying her and before he has set
her free, she only has to wait until one period has passed.”

29.25 General chapter on ‘idda of divorce
70 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd and from

Yazīd ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Qusayṭ al-Laythī that Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, ‘If a woman is divorced
and has one or two periods and then stops menstruating, she must
wait nine months. If it is clear that she is pregnant, then that is that.
If not, she must do an ‘idda of three months after the nine, and then
she is free to marry.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab said, “Divorce belongs to men, and women have the
‘idda.”
71 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab said, “e ‘idda of the woman who bleeds constantly is
a year.”

Mālik said, “What is done among us about a divorced woman
whose periods stop when her husband divorces her is that she waits
nine months. If she has not had a period in that time, she has an
‘idda of three months. If she has a period before the end of the three
months, she accepts the period. If another nine months pass
without her having a period, she does an ‘idda of three months. If
she has a second period before the end of those three months, she
accepts the period. If nine months then pass without a period, she
does an ‘idda of three months. If she has a third period, the ‘idda of
431

the period is complete. If she does not have a period, she waits three
months, and then she is free to marry. Her husband can return to
her before she becomes free to marry unless he made her divorce
irrevocable.”
Mālik said, “e sunna with us is that when a man divorces his wife
and has the option to return to her, and she does part of her ‘idda
and then he returns to her and then parts from her before he has
had intercourse with her, she does not add to what has passed of her
‘idda. Her husband has wronged himself and erred if he returns to
her and has no need of her.”
Mālik said, “What is done among us is that if a woman becomes a
Muslim while her husband is an unbeliever and then he becomes a
Muslim, he is entitled to her as long as she is still in her ‘idda. If her
‘idda is ﬁnished, he has no access to her. If he re-marries her after
the end of her ‘idda, however, that is not counted as divorce. Islam
removed her from him without divorce.”

29.26 e two arbiters
72 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Alī ibn

Abī Ṭālib said about the two arbiters about whom Allah, the
Exalted, says, “If you fear a breach between a couple, send an arbiter
from his people and an arbiter from her people. If the couple desire
to put things right, Allah will bring about a reconciliation between
them. Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware” (4:35) that both separation
and joining were overseen by the two of them.
Mālik said, “at is the best of what I have heard from the people
of knowledge. Whatever the two arbiters say concerning separation
or joining is taken into consideration.”

29.27 Oath of men to divorce while not yet married
73 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khattāb, ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar, ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd, Sālim ibn
‘Abdullāh, al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad, Ibn Shihāb, and Sulaymān
432

ibn Yasār all said, “If a man has vowed to divorce his wife before
marrying her and then he breaks his vow, divorce is obligatory for
him when he marries her.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Abdullāh
ibn Mas‘ūd said that there was nothing binding on someone who
said, “Every woman I marry is divorced” if he did not name a
speciﬁc tribe or woman.
Mālik said, “at is the best of what I have heard.”
Mālik said about a man saying to his wife, “You are divorced, and
every woman I marry is divorced,” or that all his property would be
ṣadaqa if he did not do such-and-such and then broke his oath, “As
for his wives, it is divorce as he said. As for his statement, ‘Every
woman I marry is divorced’, if he did not name a speciﬁc woman,
tribe, or land, or so on, it is not binding on him and he can marry as
he wishes. As for his property, he gives a third of it away as ṣadaqa.”

29.28 Deadline of men who do not have intercourse with their
wives
74 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab said, “If someone marries a woman and cannot have
intercourse with her, there is a deadline of a year set for him to have
intercourse with her. If he does not, they are separated.”
75 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had asked Ibn Shihāb

about whether the deadline was set from the day he had married
her, or from the day she presented the case before the ruler. He said,
“It is from the day she presents her complaint before the ruler.”
Mālik said, “As for someone who has intercourse with his wife and
then is prevented from intercourse with her, I have not heard that
there is a deadline set for him or that they have been separated.”

29.29 General section on divorce
433

76 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “I have
heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to a man from aqīf

who had ten wives when he became Muslim, ‘Take four and
separate from the rest.’”

77 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said that he had

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab, Ḥumayd ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn
‘Awf, ‘Ubaydullāh ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd, and
Sulaymān ibn Yasār all say that they had heard Abū Hurayra say
that he had heard ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb say, “If a woman is divorced
by her husband once or twice, and he leaves her until she is free to
marry and she marries another husband and he dies or divorces her,
and then she re-marries her ﬁrst husband, she is with him according
to what remains of her divorce (i.e. there is only one or two divorces
left).”

Mālik said, “at is what is done among us and there is no dispute
about it.”
78 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ābit ibn al-Aḥnaf that

he married an umm walad of ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Zayd ibn alKhaṭṭāb. He said, “‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Zayd ibn alKhaṭṭāb summoned me and I went to him. I came in upon him and
there were whips and two iron fetters placed there, and two of his
slaves whom he had made to sit there. He said, ‘Divorce her, or, by
Him by whom one swears, I will do such-and-such to you!’ I said,
‘It is divorce a thousand times.’ en I left him and saw ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Umar on the road to Makka and I told him about my situation.
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar was furious, and said, ‘at is not a divorce and
she is not unlawful for you, so return to your home.’ I was still not at
ease so I went to ‘Abdullāh ibn az-Zubayr who was the governor of
Makka at that time. I told him about my situation and what
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar had said to me. ‘Abdullāh ibn az-Zubayr said
to me, ‘She is not unlawful for you, so return to your home,’ and he
wrote to Jābir ibn al-Aswad az-Zuhrī who was the governor of
Madīna and ordered him to punish ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān
434

and to make him leave me and my family alone. I went to Madīna
and Ṣaﬁyya, the wife of ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar, ﬁtted out my wife so
that she could bring her to my house with the knowledge of
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar. en I invited ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar on the day
of my wedding to the wedding feast and he came.”
79 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār said, “I

heard ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar recite from the Qur’ān, ‘O Prophet!
When you divorce women, divorce them at the beginning of their
‘idda.’” (65:1)
Mālik said, “He meant by that to make one pronouncement of
divorce at the beginning of each period of purity.”
Y 80 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his
father said, “It used to be that a man would divorce his wife and
then return to her before her ‘idda was over, and that was all right,
even if he divorced her a thousand times. e man went to his wife
and then divorced her and when the end of her ‘idda was in sight,
he took her back and then divorced and said, ‘No! By Allah, I will
not go back to you and you will never be able to marry again.’ Allah,
the Blessed, the Exalted, sent down, ‘Divorce can be pronounced
twice; then wives should be retained with correctness and courtesy
or released with good will.’ (2:229) People then turned towards
divorce in a new light from that day whether they were divorced or
not.”
Y 81 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī
that Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, revealed about a man who
divorced his wife and then returned to her while he had no need of
her and did not mean to keep her so as to make the ‘idda period
long for her by that in order to do her harm: “Do not retain them by
force, thus overstepping the limits. Anyone who does that has
wronged himself.” (2:231) Allah warns them by that āyat.
82 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab and Sulaymān ibn Yasār were asked about a man who

divorced when he was drunk. ey said, “When a drunk man
divorces, his divorce is allowed. If he kills, he is killed for it.”
Mālik said, “at is what is done among us.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa’īd ibn alMusayyab said, “If a man does not ﬁnd the means to spend on his
wife, they are to be separated.”
Mālik said, “at is what I have seen the people of knowledge in
our city doing.”

29.30 ‘Idda of widows when pregnant
83 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdu Rabbih ibn Sa‘īd ibn

Qays that Abū Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmān said that ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Abbās and Abū Hurayra were asked when a pregnant woman whose
husband had died could remarry. Ibn ‘Abbās said, “Whichever of
two periods is the longest.” Abū Hurayra said, “When she gives
birth, she is free to marry.” Abū Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmān visited
Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and asked her about it.
Umm Salama said, “Subay‘a al-Aslamiya gave birth half a month
after the death of her husband and two men asked to marry her.
One was young and the other was old. She preferred the young man
and so the older man said, “You are not free to marry yet.” Her
family were away and he hoped that when her family returned, they
would give her to him. She went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and
he said, “You are free to marry, so marry whomever you wish.”
84 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar was asked about a woman whose husband died while she was
pregnant, and he said, “When she gives birth, she is free to marry.”
A man of the Anṣār who was with him told him that ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb had said, “Had she given birth while her husband was still
on his bed, unburied, she would still be free to marry.”
85 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that al-Miswar ibn Makhrama told him that Subay‘a al436

Aslamiya gave birth a few nights after the death of her husband.
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told her, “You are free to marry, so
marry whomever you wish.”
86 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Sulaymān ibn Yasār that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās and Abū Salama ibn
‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf diﬀered on the question of a woman who
gave birth a few nights after the death of her husband. Abū Salama
said, “When she gives birth to the child she is carrying, she is free
to marry.” Ibn ‘Abbās said, “Whichever of the end of two periods is
the longest.” Abū Hurayra came and said, “I am with my nephew,”
meaning Abū Salama. ey sent Kurayb, a mawlā of ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Abbās, to Umm Salama, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, to ask her
about it. He came back and told them that she had said that Subay‘a
al-Aslamiya had given birth a few nights after the death of her
husband, and she had brought the matter to the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬and he had said, “You are free to marry, so marry whomever you
wish.”
Mālik said, “is is how the people of knowledge here continue to
act.”

29.31 Widows remaining in their houses until free to marry
87 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sa‘īd ibn Isḥāq ibn Ka‘b

ibn ‘Ujra from his paternal aunt, Zaynab bint Ka‘b ibn ‘Ujra, that alFuray‘a bint Mālik ibn Sinān, the sister of Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī,
informed her that she went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and asked
to be able to return to her people among the Banū Khudra since her
husband had gone out in search of some of his slaves who had run
away and he had caught up with them near al-Qudūm (which is six
miles from Madīna) and they had killed him.
She said, “I asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬if I could return to my
people in the Banū Khudra, as my husband had not left me a
dwelling which belonged to him, and had left me with me no
maintenance. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Yes,’ so I left. When
437

I was in the courtyard, the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬called me or
summoned me, and I answered him. He said, ‘What did you say?’ I
repeated the story about my husband. He said, ‘Stay in your house
until what is written reaches its term.’ I did the ‘idda in the house
for four months and ten days.”
She said, “When ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān sent for me, I told him that,
and he followed it and made judgements accordingly.”
88 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd ibn Qays al-

Makkī from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb from Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab that
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb sent back widows from the desert and
prevented them from performing the ḥajj.
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he had
heard that as-Sa’ib ibn Khabbāb died and his wife went to ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Umar. She mentioned to him that her husband had died and
mentioned some land which they had at Qanāh (a district on the
outskirts of Madīna), and asked him if it would be all right for her
to stay overnight there. He forbade her to do so. So, she used to go
out before dawn from Madīna and spent the whole day on their
land, and then, when evening came, she would go back to Madīna
and spend the night in her house.
89 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Hishām ibn ‘Urwa said

about a Bedouin woman whose husband died, that she was to stay
where her people stayed.
Mālik said, “is is what is done among us.”
90 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “e only place a woman whose husband has died and a
woman who is absolutely divorced can spend the night is in their
houses.”

29.32 ‘Idda of an umm walad on her master’s death
Y

438

Y 91 aḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that he
had heard al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad say that Zayd ibn ‘Abd alMalik separated some men and their wives who were slave-girls who
had borne children to men who had died, because they had married
them after one or two menstrual periods. He separated them until
they had done an ‘idda of four months and ten days. Al-Qāsim ibn
Muḥammad said, “Glory be to Allah! Allah says in His Book,
‘ose of you who die, leaving wives.’ (2:234) ey are not wives.”
92 Mālik related that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “e ‘idda of an

umm walad when her master dies is one menstrual period.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that al-Qāsim
ibn Muḥammad said, “e ‘idda of an umm walad when her master
dies is one menstrual period.”
Mālik said, “is is what is done among us.”
Mālik added, “If she does not have periods, then her ‘idda is three
months.”

29.33 ‘Idda of slave-girls whose master or husband dies
93 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab and Sulaymān ibn Yasār said, “e ‘idda of a slave-girl
when her husband dies is two months and ﬁve days.”
94 Yaḥyā related to me the like of that from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb.

Mālik said about a slave who divorced a slave-girl but did not make
it absolute, “He can return to her. If he then dies while she is still in
the ‘idda from her divorce, she does the ‘idda of a slave-girl whose
husband dies, which is two months and ﬁve days. If she has been set
free and he can return to her, and she does not choose to separate
after she has been set free, and he dies while she is in the ‘idda from
the divorce, she does the ‘idda of a freewoman whose husband has
died, four months and ten days. at is because the ‘idda of
439

widowhood befell her while she was free, so her ‘idda is the ‘idda of
a freewoman.”
Mālik said, “is is what is done among us.”

29.34 Coitus interruptus
95 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān from Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān that Muḥayriz
said, “I went into the mosque and saw Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudri and so I
sat by him and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abū Sa‘īd alKhudrī said, “We went out with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬on the
expedition against the Banū al-Muṣṭaliq. We took some Arabs
prisoner, and we desired the women as celibacy was hard for us. We
wanted the ransom, so we wanted to practise coitus interruptus. We
asked, ‘Shall we practise coitus interruptus while the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬is among us before we have asked him?’ We asked him
about that and he said, ‘You do not have to not do it. ere is no self
which is to come into existence up to the Day of Rising but that it
will come into existence.’”
96 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from ‘Āmir ibn Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ from
his father that he used to practise coitus interruptus.

97 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū an-Naḍr, the mawlā of

‘Umar ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, from Ibn Aﬂaḥ, the mawlā of Abū Ayyūb
al-Anṣārī, from an umm walad of Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī that he
practised coitus interruptus.
98 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar did not practise coitus interruptus and thought that it was
disapproved.

99 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḍamra ibn Sa‘īd al-Māzinī

from al-Ḥajjāj ibn ‘Amr ibn Ghaziyya that he was sitting with Zayd
ibn ābit when Ibn Faḍl came to him. He was from the Yemen.
He said, “Abū Sa‘īd! I have slave-girls. None of the wives in my
440

keep are more pleasing to me than them, and not all of them please
me so much that I want a child by them. Shall I then practise coitus
interruptus?” Zayd ibn ābit said, “Give an opinion, Ḥajjāj!” I said,
“May Allah forgive you! We sit with you in order to learn from
you!” He said, “Give an opinion!” I said, “She is your ﬁeld. If you
wish, water it, and if you wish, leave it thirsty. I heard that from
Zayd.” Zayd said, “He has spoken the truth.”
100 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd ibn Qays al-

Makkī that a man called Dhaﬁf said that Ibn ‘Abbās was asked
about coitus interruptus, He called a slave-girl and said, “Tell
them,” She was embarrassed. He said, “It is all right, and I do it
myself.”
Mālik said, “A man does not practise coitus interruptus with a
freewoman unless she gives her permission. ere is no harm in
practising coitus interruptus with a slave-girl without her
permission. Someone who has someone else’s slave-girl as a wife
does not practise coitus interruptus with her unless her people give
him permission.”

29.35 Limit of abstaining from adornment in mourning
101 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm from Ḥumayd ibn Nāﬁ‘ that
Zaynab bint Abī Salama related these three traditions to him.
Zaynab said, “I visited Umm Ḥabība, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬,
when her father Abū Sufyān ibn Ḥarb had died. Umm Ḥabība called
for a yellowy perfume, perhaps khalūq or something else. She
rubbed the perfume ﬁrst on a slave-girl and she then wiped it on the
sides of her face and said, ‘By Allah! I have no need of perfume but I
heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, “It is not lawful for a woman
who trusts in Allah and the Last Day to abstain from adornment in
mourning for someone who has died for more than three nights,
except for four months and ten days for a husband.”’”

441

102 Zaynab said, “I went to the house of Zaynab bint Jaḥsh, the wife
of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, when her brother had died. She called for

perfume and put some on and said, ‘By Allah! I have no need of
perfume, but I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, say, “It is not
lawful for a woman who trusts in Allah and the Last Day to abstain
from adornment in mourning for someone who has died for more
than three nights, except for four months and ten days for a
husband.”’”

103 Zaynab said, “I heard my mother, Umm Salama, the wife of the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, say that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

and said, ‘Messenger of Allah! My daughter’s husband has died and
her eyes are troubling her, can she put kohl on them?’ e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘No’ two or three times. en he said,
‘It is only four months and ten days (i.e. the period of mourning). In
the Jāhiliyya none of you threw away the piece of dung until a year
had passed.’”

Ḥumayd ibn Nāﬁ‘ said, “I asked Zaynab to explain what ‘throwing
away the piece of dung at the end of a year’ meant. Zaynab said, ‘In
the Jāhiliyya when a woman’s husband died, she went into a small
tent and dressed in the worst of clothes. She did not touch perfume
or anything until a year had passed. en she was brought an animal
– a donkey, a sheep, or a bird – and she would break her ‘idda with
it, by rubbing her body against it (taftaḍḍu). Rarely did she break
her ‘idda with anything (by rubbing herself against it) but that it
died. en she would come out and would be given a piece of dung.
She would throw it away and then return to whatever she wished of
perfumes or whatever.’”

Mālik explained, “Taftaḍḍu means to wipe her skin with it in the
same way as with a healing charm.”
104 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Ṣaﬁyya bint
Abī ‘Ubayd from ‘Ā’isha and Ḥafṣa, the wives of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬,
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “It is not lawful for a woman in

mourning for someone who has died, if she trusts in Allah and the
442

Last Day, to abstain from adornment for more than three nights,
except for a husband.”
105 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Umm
Salama, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said to a woman in mourning for

her husband whose eyes were troubling her and the pain had
become severe, “Apply jilā’ kohl at night and wipe it oﬀ in the day.”
106 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sālim

ibn ‘Abdullāh and Sulaymān ibn Yasār said that if a woman whose
husband had died feared that an inﬂammation of her eyes might
aﬀect her sight or that some complaint might befall her, she should
put kohl on and seek a remedy with kohl or some other cure even if
it had perfume in it.
Mālik said, “If there is a necessity, the dīn of Allah is ease.”
107 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Ṣaﬁyya bint Abī

‘Ubayd suﬀered from an eye-complaint while she was in mourning
for her husband, ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar. She did not apply kohl until
her eyes almost had ramas (a dry white secretion in the corners of
the eye).

Mālik said, “A woman whose husband has died should anoint her
eyes with olive oil and sesame oil and the like of that since there is
no perfume in it.”
Mālik said, “A woman in mourning for her husband should not put
on any jewelry – rings, anklets or such-like, neither should she dress
in any sort of colourful, striped garment unless it is coarse. She
should not wear any cloth dyed with anything except black, and she
should only dress her hair with things like lotus-tree leaves which do
not dye the hair.”
108 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬visited Umm Salama while she was in

mourning for Abū Salama and she had put aloes on her eyes. He
asked, “What is this, Umm Salama?” She said, “It is only aloes,
443

Messenger of Allah.” He said, “Put it on at night and wipe it oﬀ in
the daytime.”
Mālik said, “e mourning of a young girl who has not yet had a
menstrual period takes the same form as the mourning of one who
has had a period. She avoids what a mature woman avoids if her
husband dies.”
Mālik said, “A slave-girl mourns her husband when he dies for two
months and ﬁve nights like her ‘idda.”
Mālik said, “An umm walad does not have to mourn when her
master dies, and a slave-girl does not have to mourn when her
master dies. Mourning is for those with husbands.”
109 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Umm
Salama, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A mourning woman can

rub her head with lotus leaves and olive oil.”

30. Suckling
30.1 Suckling of the young
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

from ‘Amra bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that ‘A’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn,
informed her that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was with her when she
heard the voice of a man asking permission to enter the room of
Ḥafṣa. ‘Ā’isha said that she had said, “Messenger of Allah! ere is a
man asking permission to enter your house!” e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I think it is so-and-so” (referring to a paternal uncle
of Ḥafṣa by suckling). ‘Ā’isha asked, “Messenger of Allah, if so-andso were alive (referring to her paternal uncle by suckling), could he
enter where I am?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬replied, “Yes,
suckling makes unlawful what birth makes unlawful.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his

father that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, said “My paternal uncle by
suckling came to me and I refused to give him permission to enter
until I had asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about it. He said, ‘He is
your paternal uncle, so give him permission.’ I said, ‘Messenger of
Allah, the woman nursed me, not the man!’ He said, ‘He is your
paternal uncle, so let him enter.’”
‘Ā’isha said, “at was after we had been commanded to adopt the
veil.”
‘Ā’isha added, “What is unlawful by birth is also made unlawful by
suckling.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Urwa ibn

az-Zubayr that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, told him that Aﬂaḥ, the
brother of Abū al-Qu‘ays, came and asked permission to visit her
after the veil had been lowered, and he was her paternal uncle by
suckling. She said, “I refused to give him permission to enter. When
445

the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came, I told him about what I had done,
and he told me to give him permission to enter.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī that

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said, “e milk which a child under two years
old sucks, even if it is only one suck, makes the foster-relatives
unlawful.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Amr ibn

ash-Sharīd that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās was asked whether, if a man
had two wives, and one of them had nursed a slave-boy, and the
other had nursed a slave-girl, the slave-boy could marry the slavegirl. He said, “No, the husband is the same.”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “ere is no kinship by suckling except for a person who
is nursed when he is small. ere is no kinship by suckling for an
older person over the age of two years.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Sālim

ibn
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar informed him that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn,
sent him away while he was being nursed to her sister, Umm
Kulthūm bint Abī Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq, and said, “Suckle him ten times
so that he can come in to see me.”
Sālim said, “Umm Kulthūm nursed me three times and then fell ill,
so that she only nursed me three times. I could not go in to see
‘Ā’isha because Umm Kulthūm did not ﬁnish the ten times for me.”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Ṣaﬁyya bint Abī

‘Ubayd told him that Ḥafṣa, Umm al-Mu’minīn, sent ‘Āṣim ibn
‘Abdullāh ibn Sa‘d to her sister, Fāṭima bint ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb,
for her to suckle him ten times so that he could come in to see her.
She did it, so he used to come in to see her.
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim that his father told him that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet
‫ ﷺ‬admitted those whom her sisters and the daughters of her
446

brother had nursed, but she did not admit those who had been
nursed by the wives of her brothers.
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibrahīm ibn ‘Uqba asked

Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab about suckling. Sa‘īd said, “Anything that
takes place in the ﬁrst two years, even if it is only a drop, makes
unlawful. Whatever is after two years, is only food that is eaten.”
Ibrāhīm ibn ‘Uqba said, “en I asked ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr and he
told me the same as what Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that he

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, “Suckling is only while the child is
in the cradle. If not, it does not cause ﬂesh and blood relations.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “Suckling,
however little or much, makes unlawful. Kinship by suckling makes
men maḥram.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “Suckling, however little or
much, when it is in the ﬁrst two years makes unlawful. As for what
is after the ﬁrst two years, little or much, it does not make anything
unlawful. It is like food.”

30.2 Suckling of older people
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that he was

asked about the suckling of an older person. He said, “‘Urwa ibn azZubayr informed me that Abū Ḥudhayfa ibn ‘Utba ibn Rabi‘a, one
of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬who was present
at Badr, adopted Sālim (who is called Sālim, the mawlā of Abū
Ḥudhayfa) as the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬adopted Zayd ibn Hāritha.
He thought of him as his son, and Abū Hudhayfa married him to
his brother‘s sister, Fāṭima bint al-Walīd ibn ‘Utba ibn Rabi‘a, who
was at that time among the ﬁrst emigrants. She was one of the best
unmarried women of the Quraysh. When Allah the Exalted sent
down in His Book what He sent down about Zayd ibn Ḥāritha,
‘Call them after their fathers. at is juster in Allah’s sight. And if
447

you do not know who their fathers were then they are your brothers
in the dīn and people under your patronage’ (33:5), people in this
position were traced back to their fathers. When the father was not
known, they were traced to their mawlā.
“Sahla bint Suhayl, who was the wife of Abū Ḥudhayfa, and one of
the tribe of ‘Amr ibn Lu’ayy, came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and
said, ‘Messenger of Allah! We think of Sālim as a son and he comes
in to see me when I am uncovered. We only have one room, so what
do you think about the situation?’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘Give him ﬁve drinks of your milk and he will become a maḥram by
that.’ She then saw him as a foster-son. ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn,
took that as a precedent for whatever men she wanted to be able to
come to see her. She ordered her sister, Umm Kulthūm bint Abī
Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq and the daughters of her brother to give milk to
whichever men she wanted to be able to come in to see her. e rest
of the wives of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬refused to let anyone come in to them
by such nursing. ey said, ‘No, by Allah! We think that what the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered Sahla bint Suhayl to do was only by
an indulgence concerning the nursing of Sālim alone. No, by Allah!
No one will come in upon us by such nursing!’
“is is what the wives of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬thought about the
suckling of an older person.”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār said, “A

man came to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar when I was with him at the place
where judgements were given and asked him about the suckling of
an older person. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar replied, ‘A man came to ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and said, ‘I have a slave-girl and I used to have
intercourse with her. My wife went to her and suckled her. When I
went to the girl, my wife told me to watch out because she had
suckled her!’ ‘Umar told him to beat his wife and to go to his slavegirl because kinship by suckling was only by the suckling of the
young.”

448

14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that a man

said to Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī, “I drank some milk from my wife‘s
breasts and it went into my stomach.” Abū Mūsā said, “I can only
but think that she is unlawful for you.” ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd said,
“Look at what opinion you are giving the man.” Abū Mūsā said,
“en what do you say?” ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd replied, “ere is
only kinship by suckling in the ﬁrst two years.”
Abū Mūsā said, “Do not ask me about anything while this learned
man is among you.”

30.3 Suckling in general
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnar from

Sulaymān ibn Yasār and from ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr from ‘Ā’isha,
Umm al-Mu’minīn, that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “What is
unlawful by birth is unlawful by suckling.”
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān ibn Nawfal said, “‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr informed me from
‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, that Judāma bint Wahb al-Asadiya
informed her that she heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘I
intended to prohibit ghīla but I remembered that the Greeks and
Persians do that without it causing any injury to their children.’”
Mālik explained, “Ghīla is that a man has intercourse with his wife
while she is suckling.”
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

Ḥazm from ‘Amra bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the
Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Amongst what was sent down of the Qur’ān was
‘ten known sucklings make unlawful’. en it was abrogated by ‘ﬁve
known sucklings’. When the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬died, it was
what is now recited of the Qur’ān.”

Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “One does not act on this.”

449

31. Business Transactions
31.1 Non-returnable deposits (‘urbūn)
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from a reliable source from ‘Amr

ibn Shu‘ayb from his father from his father’s father that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade transactions in which nonrefundable deposits were paid (‘urbūn).
Mālik said, “at is, in our opinion, but Allah knows best, when a
man buys a slave or slave-girl or rents an animal and then says to the
person from whom he bought the slave or leased the animal, ‘I will
give you a dinar or a dirham or whatever on the condition that if I
actually take the goods or ride what I have rented from you, then
what I have given you already goes towards payment for the goods
or hire of the animal. If I do not purchase the goods or hire the
animal, then what I have given you is yours without any liability.’”
Mālik said, “According to the way of doing things with us there is
nothing wrong in bartering an Arabic-speaking merchant-slave for
Abyssinian slaves or any other type that are not his equal in
eloquence, trading, shrewdness and know-how. ere is nothing
wrong in bartering one such slave for two or more other slaves with
a stated delay in the terms if he is clearly diﬀerent. If there is no
appreciable diﬀerence between the slaves, two should not be
bartered for one with a stated delay in the terms even if their racial
type is diﬀerent.”
Mālik said, “ere is nothing wrong in selling what has been bought
in such a transaction before taking possession of all of it as long as
you receive the price for it from someone other than the original
owner.”
Mālik said, “An addition to the price must not be made for a foetus
in the womb of his mother when she is sold because that is gharar
450

(an uncertain transaction). It is not known whether the child will be
male or female, good-looking or ugly, normal or handicapped, alive
or dead. All these things will aﬀect the price.”
Mālik said about a transaction where a slave or slave-girl was bought
for one hundred dinars with a stated credit period that, if the seller
regretted the sale, there was nothing wrong in him asking the buyer
to revoke it for ten dinars by which he would forgo his right to the
hundred dinars which he was owed.
Mālik said, “ere is nothing wrong in that. If, however, the buyer
regrets and asks the seller to revoke the sale of a slave or slave-girl in
consideration of which he will pay an extra ten dinars immediately
or on credit terms extended beyond the original term, that should
not be done. It is disapproved of because it is as if, for instance, the
seller is buying the one hundred dinars which is not yet due on a
year’s credit before the year expires for a slave-girl and ten dinars
which is to be paid immediately or on credit term longer than the
year. is falls into the category of selling gold with a delayed term.”
Mālik said that it was not proper for a man to sell a slave-girl to
another man for one hundred dinars on credit and then to buy her
back for more than the original price or on a credit term longer than
the original term for which he sold her. To understand why that was
disapproved of, the example of a man who sold a slave-girl on credit
and then bought her back on a credit term longer than the original
term was looked at. He might have sold her for thirty dinars with a
month to pay and then have bought her back for sixty dinars with a
year or half a year to pay. e outcome would only be that his goods
would have returned to him just like they were and the other party
would have given him thirty dinars on a month’s credit against sixty
dinars on a year or half a year’s credit. at should not be done.

31.2 Wealth of slaves
2 Yaḥyā related from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar

that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “If a slave who has wealth is sold,
451

that wealth belongs to the seller unless the buyer stipulates its
inclusion.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-upon way of doing things among
us is that, if the buyer stipulates the inclusion of the slave’s property
whether it be cash, money owed to him, or goods of known or
unknown value, then they belong to the buyer, even if the slave
possesses more than what he was purchased for, whether he was
bought for cash, as payment for a debt, or in exchange for goods.
is is possible because a master is not asked to pay zakāt on his
slave’s property. If a slave owns a slave-girl, it is lawful for him to
have intercourse with her by his right of possession. If a slave is
freed or put under contract (kitāba) to purchase his freedom, then
his property goes with him. If he becomes bankrupt, his creditors
take his property and his master is not liable for any of his debts.

31.3 Built-in liability agreements
3 Yaḥyā related from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm that Abān ibn ‘Uthmān and
Hishām ibn Ismā‘īl used to mention in their khuṭbas built-in
liability agreements in the sale of slaves, covering both a three day
period and a similar clause covering a year.
Mālik explained, “e defects a slave or slave-girl is found to have
from the time they are bought until the end of the three days are the
responsibility of the seller. e year agreement is to cover insanity,
leprosy, and loss of limbs due to disease. After a year, the seller is
free from any liability.”
Mālik said, “An inheritor or someone else who sells a slave or slavegirl without any such in-built guarantee is not responsible for any
defect in a slave and there is no liability agreement held against him
unless he was aware of a defect and concealed it. If he was aware of
a defect, the lack of guarantee does not protect him: the purchase is
returned. In our view, built-in liability agreements only apply to the
purchase of slaves.”
452

31.4 Defects in slaves
YA 4 ḥyā related from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sālim ibn
‘Abdullāh that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar sold one of his slaves for eight
hundred dirhams with the stipulation that he was not responsible
for defects. e person who bought the slave complained to
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the slave had a disease which he had not
told him about. ey argued and went to ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān for a
decision. e man said, “He sold me a slave with a disease which he
did not tell me about.” ‘Abdullāh said, “I sold to him on the
stipulation that I was not responsible.” ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān decided
that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar should take an oath that he had sold the
slave without knowing that he had any disease. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar
refused to take the oath, so the slave was returned to him and
recovered his health in his possession. ‘Abdullāh sold him
afterwards for 1500 dirhams.
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-upon way of doing things among
us about a man who buys a female slave and she becomes pregnant,
or who buys a slave and then frees him, or if there is any other such
matter which has already happened so that he cannot return his
purchase, and a clear proof is established that there was a defect in
that purchase when it was in the possession of the seller or the
defect is acknowledged by the seller or someone else, is that the
slave or slave-girl is assessed for their value with the fault they are
found to have had on the day of purchase, and the buyer is refunded,
from what he paid, the diﬀerence between the price of a slave when
sound and their price with that defect.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-upon way of doing things among
us regarding a man who buys a slave and then ﬁnds that the slave
has a defect for which he can be returned and meanwhile another
defect has happened to the slave whilst in his possession, is that if
the defect which occurred to the slave in his possession has harmed
him, like the loss of a limb, loss of an eye, or something similar, then
he has a choice. If he wants, he can have the price of the slave
453

reduced commensurate with the defect (he bought him with)
according to the prices on the day he bought him, or, if he likes, he
can pay compensation for the defect which the slave has suﬀered in
his possession and return him. e choice is up to him. If the slave
dies in his possession, the slave is valued with the defect which he
had on the day of his purchase. It is seen what his price would really
have been. If the price of the slave on the day of his purchase
without fault was one hundred dinars, and his price on the day of
purchase with fault would been eighty dinars, then the price is
reduced by the diﬀerence. ese prices are assessed according to the
market value on the day the slave was purchased.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-upon way of doing things among
us is that, if a man returns a slave-girl in whom he has found a
defect and he has already had intercourse with her, he must pay
what he has reduced of her price if she was a virgin. If she was not a
virgin, there is nothing against his having had intercourse with her
because he had charge of her.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-upon way of doing things among
us regarding a person, whether he is an inheritor or not, who sells a
slave, slave-girl or animal, which is meant to be free of defects, is
that he is not responsible for any defect in what he sold unless he
knew about the fault and concealed it. If he knew that there was a
fault and concealed it, his declaration that it was free of faults does
not absolve him, and what he sold is returned to him.”
Mālik spoke about a situation where a slave-girl was bartered for
two other slave-girls and then one of the slave-girls was found to
have a defect for which she could be returned. He said, “e slavegirl worth two other slave-girls is valued for her price. en the
other two slave-girls are valued, ignoring the defect which one of
them has. en the price of the slave-girl sold for two slave-girls is
divided between them according to their prices so that the
proportion of each of them in the price is arrived at – to the higherpriced one according to her higher price, and to the other according
454

to her value. en one looks at the one with the defect, and the
buyer is refunded according to the amount her share is aﬀected by
the defect, be it little or great. e price of the two slave-girls is
based on their market value on the day that they were bought.”
Mālik spoke about a man who bought a slave and hired him out on
a long-term or short-term basis and then found out that the slave
had a defect which necessitated his return. He said that if the man
returned the slave because of the defect, he kept the hire and the
revenue. “is is the way in which things are done in our city. at
is because, had the man bought a slave who then built a house for
him and the value of the house was many times the price of the
slave, and he then found that the slave had a defect for which he
could be returned, he would not have to make payment for the work
the slave had done for him. Similarly, he would keep any revenue
from hiring him out because he had charge of him. is is the way
of doing things among us.”
Mālik said, “e way of doing things among us when someone buys
several slaves in one lot and then ﬁnds that one of them has been
stolen, or has a defect, is that he looks at the one he ﬁnds has been
stolen or the one in which he ﬁnds a defect. If he is the pick of
those slaves, or the most expensive, or it was for his sake that he
bought them, or he is the one in whom people see the most
excellence, then the whole sale is returned. If the one who is found
to be stolen or to have a defect is not the pick of the slaves, and he
did not buy them for his sake, and there is no special virtue which
people see in him, the one who is found to have a defect or to have
been stolen is returned as he is, and the buyer is refunded his
portion of the total price.”

31.5 e purchase of slave-girls with conditions attached
5 Yaḥyā related from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ‘Ubaydullāh ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd told him that ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd
bought a slave-girl from his wife, Zaynab ath-aqaﬁyya. She made
a condition to him that, if he bought her, she could always buy her
455

back for the price that he paid. ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd asked ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb about that and ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Do not
go near her while anyone has a condition concerning her over you.”
6 Yaḥyā related from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar

would say, “A man should not have intercourse with a slave-girl
except one whom, if he wished, he could sell, and if he wished, he
could give away, and if he wished, he could keep, and if he wished,
he could do with her what he wanted.”
Mālik said that a man who bought a slave-girl on condition that he
did not sell her, give her away, or do something of that nature, was
not to have intercourse with her. at was because he was not
permitted to sell her or to give her away, so if he did not own that
from her, he did not have complete ownership of her, because an
exception had been made concerning her by the hand of someone
else. If that sort of condition entered into it, it was an improper
situation and such a sale was disliked.

31.6 Prohibition against intercourse with married slave-girls
7 Yaḥyā related from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Āmir gave ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān a slave-girl, who had a husband, that
he had purchased at Basra. ‘Uthmān said, “I will not go near her
until her husband has separated from her.” Ibn ‘Āmir compensated
the husband and he separated from her.
8 Yaḥyā related from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū Salama ibn

‘Abd ar-Rahmān ibn ‘Awf that ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf bought a
slave-girl and then found that she had a husband, so he returned
her.

31.7 Ownership of the fruit of trees sold
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If palm-trees are sold

after they have been pollinated, the fruit belongs to the seller unless
the buyer makes a stipulation about its inclusion.”
456

31.8 Prohibition against selling fruit until starting to ripen
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Ibn ‘Umar that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade selling fruit until it had started

to ripen. He forbade the transaction to both buyer and seller.

11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd aṭ-Ṭawīl from
Anas ibn Mālik that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade selling fruit

until it had become mellow. He was asked, “Messenger of Allah,
what do you mean by ‘become mellow’?” He replied, “When it
becomes rosy.”

e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬added, “Allah may prevent the fruit
from maturing, so how can you take payment from your brother for
it?”
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū ar-Rijāl Muḥammad

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥman ibn Ḥāritha from his mother, ‘Amra bint ‘Abd
ar-Raḥmān, that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade selling fruit
until it was clear of blight.
Mālik said, “Selling fruit before it has begun to ripen is an uncertain
transaction (gharar).”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from

Kharīja ibn Zayd ibn ābit that Zayd ibn ābit did not sell fruit
until the Pleaides were visible [at the beginning of the summer].
Mālik said, “e way of doing things among us about selling
melons, cucumbers, water-melons, and carrots is that it is lawful to
sell them when it is clear that they have begun to ripen. en the
buyer has what grows until the season is over. ere is no speciﬁc
timing laid down for that because the time is well-known to people,
and it may happen that the crop will be aﬀected by blight and put a
premature end to the season. If blight strikes and a third or more of
the crop is damaged, an allowance for that is deducted from the
price of purchase.”



457

31.9 e sale of ‘ariyyas
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar from Zayd ibn ābit that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

allowed the holder of an ‘ariyya to barter the dates on the palm for
the amount of dried dates it was estimated that the palms would
produce.
14.1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwud ibn al-Ḥusayn

from Abū Sufyān, the mawlā of Ibn Abī Aḥmad, from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬allowed the produce of an
‘ariyya to be bartered for an estimation of what the produce would
be when the crop was less than ﬁve awsāq or equal to ﬁve awsāq.
Dāwud was unsure whether he said ﬁve awsāq or less than ﬁve.
Mālik said, “‘Ariyyas can be sold for an estimation of what amount
of dried dates will be produced. e crop is examined and estimated
while still on the palm trees. is is allowed because it comes into
the category of delegation of responsibility, handing over rights, and
involving a partner. Had it been like a form of sale, no one would
have made someone else a partner in the produce until it was ripe
nor would he have renounced his right to any of it or put someone
in charge of it until the buyer had taken possession.”

31.10 e eﬀect of crop damage on the sale of agricultural
produce
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Abū ar-Rijāl Muḥammad

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān heard his mother, ‘Amra bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān
say, “A man bought the fruit of an enclosed orchard in the time of
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he tended it while staying on the
land. It became clear to him that there was going to be some loss, he
asked the owner of the orchard to reduce the price for him or to
revoke the sale, but the owner made an oath not to do so. e
mother of the buyer went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and told
him about it. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘By this oath he has
sworn not to do good.’ e owner of the orchard heard about that
458

and went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said, ‘Messenger of
Allah, the choice is his.’”
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

‘Abd al-‘Azīz decided in a case to make a reduction for crop damage.
Mālik said, “is is what we do in this situation.”

Mālik added, “Crop damage refers to whatever causes loss of a third
or more for the purchaser. Anything less is not counted as crop
damage.”

31.11 Keeping back a portion of the fruit
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān

that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad would sell produce from his orchard
and keep some of it aside.
Y 18 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr
that his grandfather, Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm sold the fruit
of an orchard of his called al-Afraq for 4000 dirhams, and he kept
aside 800 dirhams worth of dry dates.
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū ar-Rijāl Muḥammad

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Ḥāritha that his mother, ‘Amra bint ‘Abd
ar-Rahmān, used to sell her fruit and keep some of it aside.

Mālik said, “e generally agreed-upon way of doing things among
us is that when a man sells the fruit of his orchard, he can keep
aside up to a third of the fruit, but that is not to be exceeded. ere
is no harm in what is less than a third.”
Mālik added that he thought there was no harm for a man to sell
the fruit of his orchard and keep aside only the fruit of a certain
palm-tree or palm-trees which he had chosen and whose number he
had speciﬁed, because the owner was only keeping aside certain fruit
of his own orchard and everything else he sold.

459

31.12 Disapproved practices in the sale of dates
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Dried dates for

dried dates should be exchanged like for like.’ It was said to him,
‘Your agent in Khaybar takes one ṣā‘ for two.’ e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Call him to me.’ So he was summoned. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked, ‘Do you take one ṣā‘ for two?’ He
replied, ‘Messenger of Allah! Why should they sell me good dates
for assorted low quality dates, ṣā‘ for ṣā‘!’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘Sell the assorted ones for dirhams, and then buy the good ones
with those dirhams.’”
21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd al-Ḥamīd ibn Suhayl

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf from Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab from
Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī and from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬appointed a man as an agent in Khaybar, and he brought
him some excellent dates. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him,
“Are all the dates of Khaybar like this?” He said, “No, by Allah,
Messenger of Allah! We take ṣā‘ of this kind for two ṣā‘ or two ṣā‘
for three.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do not do that. Sell the
assorted ones for dirhams and then buy the good ones with the
dirhams.”
22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Yazīd that

Zayd ibn ‘Ayyāsh told him that he had once asked Sa‘d ibn Abī
Waqqāṣ about selling white wheat for a type of good barley. Sa‘d
asked him which was the better and when he told him the white
wheat, he forbade the transaction. Sa‘d said, “I heard the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬being asked about selling dried dates for fresh dates and
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Do the dates diminish in size when
they become dry?’ When he was told that they did, he forbade that.”

31.13 Muzābana and muḥāqala
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade muzābana.

460

Muzābana was selling fresh dates for dried dates by measure, and
selling grapes for raisins by measure.
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dā’ūd ibn al-Ḥusayn from

Abū Sufyān, the mawlā of Ibn Abī Aḥmad, from Abū Sa‘īd alKhudrī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade muzābana and
muḥāqala. Muzābana is selling fresh dates for dried dates while they
were still on the trees. Muḥāqala is renting land in exchange for
wheat.
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade muzābana and

muhāqala. Muzābana was selling fresh dates for dried dates.
Muḥāqala was buying unharvested wheat in exchange for threshed
wheat and renting land in exchange for wheat.
Ibn Shihāb added that he had asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab about
renting land for gold and silver. He said, “ere is no harm in it.”

Mālik said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade muzābana. e
explanation of muzābana is that it is buying something whose
number, weight and measure is not known with something whose
number, weight or measure is known; for instance, if a man has a
stack of food whose measure is not known, either of wheat, dates, or
whatever food, or the man has goods of wheat, date kernels, herbs,
saﬄower, cotton, ﬂax, silk, and does not know its measure or weight
or number, and then a buyer approaches him and proposes that he
weigh or measure or count the goods, but before he does, he
speciﬁes a certain weight, or measure, or number and guarantees to
pay the price for that amount, agreeing that whatever falls short of
that amount is a loss against him and whatever is in excess of that
amount is a gain for him. at is not a sale. It is taking risks and it
is an uncertain transaction. It falls into the category of gambling
because he is not buying something from him for something
deﬁnite which he pays. Everything which resembles this is also
forbidden.”
461

Mālik said that another example of that was, for instance, a man
proposing to another man, “You have cloth. I will guarantee you
from this cloth of yours so many hooded cloaks, the measure of each
cloak to be such-and-such (naming a measurement). Whatever loss
there is, is against me and I will fulﬁl you the speciﬁed amount.
Whatever excess there is, is mine.” Or perhaps the man proposes, “I
will guarantee you from this cloth of yours so many shirts, the
measurement of each shirt to be such-and-such, and whatever loss
there is, is against me and I will fulﬁll the speciﬁed amount.
Whatever excess there is, is mine.” Or perhaps a man proposes to a
man who has cattle or camel hides, “I will cut up these hides of
yours into sandals on a pattern I will show you. I will make up the
loss of whatever falls short of a hundred pairs. Whatever is over is
mine because I guaranteed you.” Another example was that a man
says to a man who has ben-nuts, “I will press these nuts of yours. I
will make up whatever falls short of such-and-such a weight by the
pound. Whatever is more than that is mine.”
Mālik said that all this and whatever else was like it or resembled it
was in the category of muzābana, and was neither good nor
permitted. It was also the same case for a man to say to a man who
had fodder-leaves, date kernels, cotton, ﬂax, herbs or saﬄower, “I
will buy these leaves from you in exchange for such-and-such a ṣā‘,
(indicating leaves which were pounded like his leaves) or these date
kernels for such-and-such a ṣā‘ of kernels of them, and the like of
that in the case of saﬄower, cotton, ﬂax and herbs.”
Mālik said, “All this is included in what we have described of
muzābana.”

31.14 General remarks about selling produce at its source
26 Mālik said, “ere is no harm in buying dates from speciﬁed

trees or a speciﬁed orchard or buying milk from speciﬁed sheep
when the buyer starts to take them as soon as he has paid the price.
at is like buying oil from a container. A man buys some of it for a
dinar or two and gives his gold and stipulates that it be measured
462

out for him. ere is no harm in that. If the container breaks and
the oil is wasted, the buyer takes his gold back and there is no
transaction between them.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in anything which is taken right away
as it is, like fresh milk and fresh picked dates, which the buyer can
take on a day to day basis. If the supply runs out before the buyer
has what he has paid for in full, the seller gives him back the portion
of the gold that is owed to him, or else the buyer takes other goods
from him to the value of what he is owed and about which they are
in mutual agreement. e buyer should stay with the seller until he
has taken it. It is disapproved of for the seller to leave because the
transaction would then come into the forbidden category of a debt
for a debt. If a stated time period for payment or delivery enters into
the transaction, it is also disapproved. Delay and deferment are not
permitted in it, and are only acceptable when it is standard practice
on deﬁnite terms by which the seller guarantees it to the buyer, but
this is not to be from one speciﬁc orchard or from any speciﬁc
sheep.”
Mālik was asked about a man who bought an orchard from another
man in which there were various types of palm-trees – excellent
‘ajwa palms, good kabīs palms, ‘adhq palms and other types. e
seller kept aside the produce of a certain palm of his choice from the
sale. Mālik said, “at is not proper because if he does that and
keeps aside, for instance, dates of the ‘ajwa variety whose yield
would be ﬁfteen ṣā‘s and he picks the kabīs dates in their place, and
the yield of their dates is ten ṣā‘s, or he picks the ‘ajwa which yield
ﬁfteen ṣā‘s and leaves the kabīs which yield ten ṣā‘s, it is as if he
bought the ‘ajwa for the kabīs making allowances for their diﬀerence
of quality. is is the same as a man dealing kabīs another man who
has heaps of dates before him – a heap of ﬁfteen ṣā‘s of ‘ajwa, a heap
of ten ṣā‘s of kabīs, and a heap of twelve ṣā‘s of ‘adhq. e ﬁrst man
gives the owner of the dates a dinar to let him choose and take
whichever of the heaps he likes.”

463

Mālik said, “at is not proper.”
Mālik was asked what a man who bought fresh dates from the
owner of an orchard and advanced him a dinar was entitled to if the
crop ran out. Mālik said, “e buyer makes a reckoning with the
owner of the orchard and takes takes the remainder of his dinar. If
the buyer has taken two-thirds of a dinar’s worth of dates, he gets
back the third of a dinar which is owed him. If the buyer has taken
three-quarters of a dinar’s worth of dates, then he gets back the
quarter which is owed to him, or they come to a mutual agreement
and the buyer takes what is owed him from his dinar from the
owner of the orchard in something else of his choosing. If, for
instance, he prefers to take dry dates or some other goods, he takes
them according to what is due. If he takes the dry dates or some
other goods, he should stay with him until he has been paid in full.”
Mālik said, “is is the same situation as hiring out a speciﬁed
riding-camel or hiring out a slave tailor, carpenter or some other
kind of worker, or letting a house and taking payment in advance for
the hire of the slave or the rent of the house or camel. en an
accident happens to what has been hired resulting in death or
something else. e owner of the camel, slave or house returns what
remains of the rent of the camel, the hire of the slave or the rent of
the house to the one who advanced him the money, and the owner
reckons what will settle that up in full. If, for instance, he has
provided half of what the man paid for, he returns the remaining
half of what he advanced, or according to whatever amount is due.”
Mālik said, “Paying in advance for something which is on hand is
only good when the buyer takes possession of what he has paid for
as soon as he hands over the gold, whether it be a slave, camel, or
house, or in the case of dates, he starts to pick them as soon as he
has paid the money. It is not good that there be any deferment or
credit in such a transaction.”
Mālik said, “An example illustrating what is disapproved of in this
situation is that, for instance, a man may say that he will pay
464

someone in advance for the use of his camel on the ḥajj, and the ḥajj
is still some time oﬀ, or he may say something similar to that about
a slave or a house. When he does that, he only pays the money in
advance on the understanding that if he ﬁnds the camel to be sound
at the time the hire is due to begin, he will take it by virtue of what
he has already paid. If an accident, or death, or something happens
to the camel, then he will get his money back and the money he
paid in advance will be considered as a loan.”
Mālik said, “is is not the same as someone who takes immediate
possession of what he rents or hires, so that it does not fall into the
category of ‘uncertainty’ or disapproved payment in advance. at is
following a common practice. An example of it is that a man buys a
slave, or slave-girl, and takes possession of them and pays their
price. If something happens to them within the period of the year
indemniﬁcation contract, he takes his gold back from the one from
whom he made the purchase. ere is no harm in that. is is the
precedent of the sunna in the matter of selling slaves.”
Mālik said, “Someone who hires a speciﬁc slave, or rents a speciﬁc
camel, up until a certain time, taking possession of that camel or
slave, has acted properly because he did not take possession of what
he wanted to rent or hire, nor did he advance any money as a loan
which will be the responsibility of the other until the ﬁrst man gets
it back.”

31.15 Selling fruit
27 Mālik said, “e generally agreed-upon way of doing things

among us is that someone who buys some fruit, whether fresh or
dry, should not resell it until he gets full possession of it. He should
not barter things of the same type, except hand to hand. Whatever
can be made into dried fruit to be stored and eaten should not be
bartered for its own kind, except hand to hand, like for like, when it
is the same kind of fruit. In the case of two diﬀerent kinds of fruit,
there is no harm in bartering two of one kind for one of another,
hand to hand on the spot. It is not good to set delayed terms. As for
465

produce which is not dried and stored but is eaten fresh like
watermelons, cucumbers, melons, carrots, citrons, bananas,
pomegranates and so on, which when dried no longer counts as
fruit, and is not a thing which is stored up as fruit is, I think that it
is quite proper to barter such things two for one of the same variety
hand to hand. If no term enters into it, there is no harm in it.”

31.16 Selling gold for silver, minted and unminted
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered the two Sa‘ds to sell a vessel made of

either gold or silver from the booty. ey either sold each three
units of weight for four units weight of coins or each four units of
weight for three units of coins. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to
them, ‘You have taken usury, so return it.’”
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Musā ibn Abī Tamīm from

Abū al-Ḥubāb Sa‘īd ibn Yasār from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A dinar for a dinar, a dirham for a
dirham, no excess between the two.”
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from Abū Sa‘īd alKhudrī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do not sell gold for

gold except like for like and do not increase one part over another
part. Do not sell silver for silver, except like for like and do not
increase one part over another part. Do not sell some of it which is
not there for some of it which is.”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ḥumayd ibn Qays al-

Makkī that Mujāhid said, “I was with ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar when an
artisan came to him and said, ‘Abū ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān, I fashion gold
and then sell what I have made for more than its weight. I take an
amount equivalent to the work of my hand.’ ‘Abdullāh forbade him
to do that, so the artisan repeated the question to him, and
‘Abdullāh continued to forbid him until he came to the door of the
mosque or to an animal that he intended to mount. en ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Umar said, ‘A dinar for a dinar, and a dirham for a dirham.
466

ere is no increase between them. is is the command of our
Prophet to us and our advice to you.’”
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard from his

grandfather, Mālik ibn Abī ‘Āmir that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān said,
“e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to me, ‘Do not sell a dinar for two
dinars nor a dirham for two dirhams.’”
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār that Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān sold a gold or silver
drinking-vessel for more than its weight. Abū ad-Dardā’ said, “I
heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbidding such sales except like
for like.” Mu‘āwiya said to him, “I do not see any harm in it.” Abū
ad-Dardā’ said to him, “Who will excuse me from Mu‘āwiya? I tell
him something from the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he gives me his
own opinion! I will not live in the same land as you!” en Abū adDardā’ went to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and mentioned that to him.
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb therefore wrote to Mu‘āwiya, “Do not sell it
except like for like, weight for weight.”
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Do not sell gold for gold
except like for like, and do not increase one part over another part.
Do not sell silver for silver except like for like, and do not increase
one part over another part. Do not sell silver for gold, one of them
at hand and the other to be given later. If someone asks you to wait
for payment until he has been to his house, do not leave him. I fear
ramā’ for you.” Ramā’ is usury.
35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār from

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Do not sell
gold for gold except like for like. Do not increase part of it over
another part. Do not sell silver for silver except for like, and do not
increase part of it over another part. Do not sell some of it which is
there for some of it which is not. If someone asks you to wait for
payment until he has been to his house, do not leave him. I fear
ramā’ for you.” Ramā’ is usury.
467

36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that al-Qāsim

ibn Muḥammad said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, ‘A dinar for a
dinar, and a dirham for a dirham, and a ṣā‘ for a ṣā‘. Something to
be collected later is not to be sold for something at hand.’”
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Abū az-Zinād heard Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab say, “ere is usury only in gold or silver or what is
weighed or measured of what is eaten or drunk.”

37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab say, “Clipping gold and silver is part of causing
corruption in the land.”

Mālik said, “ere is no harm in buying gold with silver or silver
with gold without measuring, if it is unminted, or a piece of
jewellery which has been made. Counted dirhams and counted
dinars should not be bought without reckoning until they are known
and counted. To abandon number and buy them at random would
only be to speculate. at is not part of the business transactions of
Muslims. As for what is weighed of unminted objects and jewellery,
there is no harm in buying such things without measuring. To buy
them without measuring is like buying wheat, dried dates, and such
food-stuﬀs, which are sold without measuring, even though things
like them are measured.”
Mālik spoke about buying a Qur’ān, a sword or a signet ring, which
had some gold or silver work on it, with dinars and dirhams. He
said, “e value of the object bought with dinars, which has gold in
it is looked at. If the value of the gold is up to one-third of the price,
it is permitted and there is no harm in it if the sale is hand to hand
and there is no deferment in it. When something which has silver in
it is bought with silver, the value is looked at. If the value of the
silver is one-third, it is permitted and there is no harm in it if the
sale is hand to hand. at is still the way that people act among us.”

31.17 Money-changing

468

38 aḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Mālik ibn
Y Aws ibn al-Ḥadathān an-Naṣrī that one time he asked to exchange
100 dinars. He said, “Ṭalha ibn ‘Ubaydullāh called me over and we

made a mutual agreement that he would make the exchange with
me. He took the gold and turned it about in his hand and then said,
‘I can’t do it until my treasurer brings the money to me from alGhāba.’ ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb was listening and ‘Umar said, ‘By
Allah! Do not leave him until you have taken it from him!’ en he
said, ‘e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Gold for silver is usury
except hand to hand. Wheat for wheat is usury except hand to hand.
Dates for dates is usury except hand to hand. Barley for barley is
usury except hand to hand.”’”
Mālik said, “When a man exchanges dirhams with dinars and then
ﬁnds a bad dirham among them and wants to return it, the
exchange of the dinars breaks down, and he returns the silver and
takes back his dinars. e explanation of what is disapproved in that
is that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Gold for silver is usury
except hand to hand,’ and ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, ‘If someone
asks you to wait to be paid until he has gone back to his house, do
not leave him.’ When he returns a dirham to him from the
exchange after he has left him, it is like a debt or something
deferred. For that reason, it is disapproved of, and the exchange
collapses. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb wanted that all gold, silver and food
should not be sold for goods to be paid later. He did not want there
to be any delay or deferment in any such sale, whether it involved
one commodity or diﬀerent sorts of commodities.”

31.18 Selling gold for gold and silver for silver by weight
39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yazīd ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn

Qusayṭ saw Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab sell gold, counterpoising it for
gold. He poured his gold into one pan of the scales and the man
with whom he was counterpoising put his gold in the other pan of
the scale and, when the pivot of the scales was balanced, they took
and gave.
469

Mālik said, “According to the way things are done among us, there
is no harm in selling gold for gold and silver for silver by
counterpoising the weight, even if eleven dinars are taken for ten
dinars hand to hand, when the weight of gold is equal, coin for coin,
even if the number is diﬀerent. Dirhams in such a situation are
treated the same way as dinars.”
Mālik said, “If, when counterpoising gold for gold or silver for
silver, there is a diﬀerence of weight, one party should not give the
other the value of the diﬀerence in silver or something else. Such a
transaction is ugly and a means to usury because if one of the parties
were permitted to take the diﬀerence for a separate price, it could be
as if he had bought it separately, and so it would be permitted. en
it would be possible for him to ask for many times the value of the
diﬀerence in order to permit the completion of the transaction
between the two parties.”
Mālik said, “If he had really been sold the diﬀerence without
anything else with it, he would not have taken it for a tenth of the
price for which he took it in order to put a ‘legal front’ on the
transaction. is leads to allowing what is forbidden. e matter is
forbidden.”
Mālik said that it was not good when counterpoising to give good
old gold coins and put along with them unminted gold in exchange
for worn Kuﬁc gold, which was unpopular, and to then treat the
exchange as like for like.
Mālik said, “e commentary on why that is disapproved is that the
owner of the good gold uses the excellence of his old gold coins as
an excuse to throw in the unminted gold with it. Had it not been for
the superiority of his (good) gold over the gold of the other party,
the other party would not have counterpoised the unminted gold for
his Kuﬁc gold and the deal would have been refused.
“It is like a man wanting to buy three ṣā‘s of ‘ajwa dried dates for
two ṣā‘s and a mudd of kabīs dates and, on being told that it was not
470

good, then oﬀering two ṣā‘s of kabīs and a ṣā‘s of poor dates desiring
to make the sale possible. at is not good because the owner of the
‘ajwa should not give him a ṣā‘ of ‘ajwa for a ṣā‘ of poor dates. He
would only be giving him that because of the excellence of kabīs
dates.
“Or it is like a man asking someone to sell him three ṣā‘s of white
wheat for two and a half ṣā‘s of Syrian wheat, and being told that it
was not good except like for like, and so oﬀering two ṣā‘s of wheat
and one ṣā‘ of barley, intending to make the sale possible between
them. at is not good because no one would have given a ṣā‘ of
barley for a ṣā‘ of white wheat had that ṣā‘ been by itself. It was only
given because of the excellence of Syrian wheat over the white
wheat. is is not good. It is the same as the case of the unminted
gold.”
Mālik said, “Where gold, silver and food – things which should
only be sold like for like – are concerned, something disliked and of
poor quality should not be put with something good and desirable
in order to make the sale possible and to make a bad situation
lawful. When something of desirable quality is put with something
of poor quality and it is only included so that its excellence in
quality is noticed, something is being sold which, if it had been sold
on its own, would not have been accepted and to which the buyer
would not have paid any attention. It is only accepted by the buyer
because of the superiority of what comes with it over his own goods.
Transactions involving gold, silver or food must not have anything
of this description enter into them. If the owner of the poor quality
items wants to sell them, he sells them on their own, and does not
put anything with them. ere is no harm if it is like that.”

31.19 Buying on delayed terms and re-selling for less on more
immediate terms
40 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever buys

471

foodstuﬀs should not then sell them until he has received the whole
amount.”
41 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār from
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Someone

who buys food must not sell it until he has taken possession of it.”

42 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar said, “In the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬we used to

buy food. He sent orders for us to move our purchases from the
place in which we purchased them to another place before we resold them.”
43 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Ḥakīm ibn

Ḥizām had bought some food that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb had
ordered people to have, and then re-sold it to people. ‘Umar ibn alKhattāb heard about this and he revoked the sale and said, “Do not
sell food which you have purchased until you take delivery of it.”
44 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that receipts

were given to people in the time of Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam for the
produce of the market at al-Jār. People bought and sold the receipts
among themselves before they had taken actual delivery of the
goods. Zayd ibn ābit and one of the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬went to Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam and said,
“Marwān! Do you make usury lawful?” He said, “I seek refuge with
Allah! What is that?” He said, “ese receipts which people buy and
sell before they take delivery of the goods.” Marwān therefore sent
guards to follow them and to take them from people’s hands and
return them to their owners.
45 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that a man

wanted to buy food from a man in advance. e man who wanted to
sell the food to him went with him to the market and he began to
show him heaps, saying, “Which one would you like me to buy for
you?” e buyer said to him, “Are you selling me what you do not
have?” So they went to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar and mentioned that to
472

him. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said to the buyer, “Do not buy from him
what he does not have.” He said to the seller, “Do not sell what you
do not have.”
46 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard Jamīl

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān the Mu’adhdhin say to Sa‘īd ibn al-Muysayyab,
“I am a man who buys whatever Allah wills of the receipts for the
provisions which people are oﬀered at al-Jār. I want to take payment
for goods that I guarantee to deliver at a future date.” Sa‘īd said to
him, “Do you intend to settle these things with receipts for
provisions you have bought?” He said, “Yes.” So he forbade that.
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
in which there is no dispute about buying food – wheat, barley,
durra-sorghum, pearl millet, or any pulse or anything resembling
pulses on which zakāt is obliged, or condiments of any sort, oil,
ghee, honey, vinegar, cheese, sesame oil, milk and so on – is that the
buyer should not re-sell any of that until he has taken possession
and complete delivery of it.”

31.20 What is disapproved of in selling food with delayed
payment or delivery
47 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Abū az-Zinād heard Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab and Sulaymān ibn Yasār forbid a man to sell wheat
for gold on delayed terms and then to buy dried dates with the gold
before he had taken delivery of the gold.
48 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Kathīr ibn Farqad asked

Abū Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm about a man who
sold food to be delivered at a future date to a man for gold and then
with the gold he bought dates before he had taken delivery of the
gold. He disapproved of that and forbade it.
Yaḥyā related the like of that to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb.
Mālik said, “Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab, Sulaymān ibn Yasār, Abū Bakr
ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm, and Ibn Shihāb forbade a man
473

to sell wheat for gold and then buy dates with that gold before he
had received the gold from the transaction in which he sold the
wheat. ere is no harm in someone buying dates on delayed terms,
on the strength of the gold for which he sold the wheat, from
someone other than the person to whom he sold the wheat before
taking possession of the gold, and to refer the one from whom he
bought the dates to his debtor who bought the wheat, for the gold
he is owed for the dates.”
Mālik said, “I asked more than one of the people of knowledge
about that and they did not see any harm in it.”

31.21 Pre-payment on food
49 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said that there was no harm in a man making an advance to
another man for food, with a set description and price until a set
date, as long as it was not in crops or dates which had not begun to
ripen.
Mālik said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade selling food before
getting delivery of it.”
Mālik said that it was not good if the buyer regretted his purchase
and asked the seller to revoke the sale for him and he would not
press him immediately for what he had paid. e people of
knowledge forbade that. at was because when the food was made
ready for the buyer by the seller, the buyer deferred his due from the
seller in order that he might revoke the sale for him. at was
selling food with delayed terms before taking delivery of the food.
Mālik said, “e explanation of that is that when the date of
delivery comes and the buyer dislikes the food, the seller takes goods
for money to be paid later and so it is not revocation. Revocation is
that in which neither the buyer nor the seller is increased. When
increase occurs by deferment of payment for a time period, or by
anything which increases one of them over the other or anything
474

which gives one of them proﬁt, it is not revocation. When either of
them do that, revocation becomes a sale. ere is an indulgence for
revocation, partnership, and transfer, as long as increase, decrease, or
deferment does not come into them. If increase, decrease, or
deferment comes into it, it becomes a sale. Whatever makes a sale
lawful makes it lawful and whatever makes a sale unlawful makes it
unlawful.”
Mālik said, “If someone pays in advance for Syrian wheat, there is
no harm if he takes a load after the term falls due.”
Mālik said, “It is the same with whoever advances for any kind of
thing. ere is no harm in him taking better than whatever he has
made an advance for or worse than it after the agreed delivery date.
e explanation of that is that if, for instance, a man makes an
advance for a certain weight of wheat. ere is no harm if he decides
to take some barley or Syrian wheat. If he has made an advance for
good dates, there is no harm if he decides to take poor quality dates.
If he paid in advance for red raisins, there is no harm if he takes
black ones when it happens after the agreed delivery date, and when
he takes like measure of what he paid for in advance.”

31.22 Bartering food for food with no increase between them
50 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sulaymān

ibn Yasār said, “e fodder of the donkeys of Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ
ran out and so he told his slave to take some of the family’s wheat
and buy barley with it, and to only take a like quantity.”
51 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that Sulaymān ibn

Yasār told him that one time the fodder of the animals of ‘Abd arRaḥmān ibn al-Aswad ibn ‘Abd Yaghūth was ﬁnished so he said to
his slave, “Take some of your family’s wheat as food and buy barley
with it, and take only a like quantity.”
52 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard the same as

that from al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad from Ibn Mu‘ayqib ad-Dawsī.
475

Mālik said, “is is the way of doing things among us.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
is that wheat is not sold for wheat, dates for dates, wheat for dates,
dates for raisins, wheat for raisins, nor any kind of food sold for
food at all, except from hand to hand. If there is any sort of delayed
terms in the transaction, it is not good. It is unlawful. Condiments
are not bartered except from hand to hand.”
Mālik said, “Food and condiments are not bartered when they are
the same type, two of one kind for one of the other. A mudd of
wheat is not sold for two mudds of wheat, nor a mudd of dates for
two mudds of dates, nor a mudd of raisins for two mudds of raisins,
nor is anything of that sort done with grains and condiments when
they are of one kind, even if it is hand to hand.
“is is the same position as with silver for silver and gold for gold.
No increase is lawful in the transaction, and only like for like, from
hand to hand, is lawful.”
Mālik said, “If there is a clear diﬀerence in food-stuﬀs which are
measured and weighed, there is no harm in taking two of one kind
for one of another, hand to hand. ere is no harm in taking a ṣā‘ of
dates for two ṣā‘s of raisins, and a ṣā‘ of wheat for two ṣā‘s of ghee. If
the two sorts in the transaction are diﬀerent, there is no harm in two
for one or more than that from hand to hand. If delayed terms enter
into the sale, it is not lawful.”
Mālik said, “It is not lawful to trade a heap of wheat for a heap of
wheat. ere is no harm in a heap of wheat for a heap of dates, from
hand to hand. at is because there is no harm in buying wheat
with dates without precise measurement.”
Mālik said, “With kinds of foods and condiments that diﬀer from
each other, and the diﬀerence is clear, there is no harm in bartering
one kind for another, without precise measurement from hand to
hand. If delayed terms enter into the sale, there is no good in it.
476

Bartering such things without precise measurement is like buying it
with gold and silver without measuring precisely.”
Mālik said, “at is because you buy wheat with silver without
measuring precisely, and dates with gold without measuring
precisely, and it is lawful. ere is no harm in it.”
Mālik said, “It is not good for someone to make a heap of food
knowing its measure and then to sell it as if it had not been
measured precisely, concealing its measure from the buyer. If the
buyer wants to return such food to the seller, he can, because he
concealed its measure and it is an uncertain transaction. is is done
with any kind of food or other goods whose measure and number
the seller knows, and which he then sells without measurement and
the buyer does not know that. If the buyer wants to return that to
the seller, he can return it. e people of knowledge still forbid such
a transaction.”
Mālik said, “ere is no good in selling one round loaf of bread for
two round loaves, nor large for small when some of them are bigger
than others. When care is taken that they are like for like, there is
no harm in the sale, even if they are not weighed.”
Mālik said, “It is not good to sell a mudd of butter and a mudd of
milk for two mudds of butter. is is like what we described of
selling dates when two ṣā‘s of kabīs and a ṣā‘ of poor quality dates
were sold for three ṣā‘s of ‘ajwa dates after the buyer had said to the
seller, ‘Two ṣā‘s of kabīs dates for three ṣā‘s of ‘ajwa dates is not
good,’ and then he did that to make the transaction possible. e
owner of the milk puts the milk with his butter so that he can use
the superiority of his butter over the butter of the other party to
include his milk along with it.”
Mālik said, “Flour for wheat is like for like, and there is no harm in
that. at is if he does not mix up anything with the ﬂour and sell it
for wheat, like for like. Had he put half a mudd of ﬂour and half of
wheat, and then sold that for a mudd of wheat, it would be like
477

what we have described previously, and it would not be good
because he would want to use the superiority of his good wheat to
put ﬂour along with it. Such a transaction is not good.”

31.23 General section on selling food
53 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdullāh

ibn Abī Maryam asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab’s advice. “I am a
man,” he said, “who buys food with receipts from al-Jār. Perhaps I
will buy something for a dinar and half a dirham, and will be given
food for the half dirham.” Sa‘īd said, “No. You give a dirham and
take the rest in food.” (A half dirham did not exist as a coin.)
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that
Muḥammad ibn Sīrīn used to say, “Do not sell grain on the ear until
it is white.”
54

Mālik said, “If someone buys food for a known price to be delivered
at a stated date, and when the date comes, the one who owes the
food says, ‘I do not have the food. Sell me the food which I owe you
with delayed terms.’ e owner of the food says, ‘is is not good
because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade selling food until the
transaction has been completed.’ e one who owes the food says to
his creditor, ‘Sell me any kind of food on delayed terms until I
discharge the debt to you.’ is is not good because he gives him
food and then he returns it to him. e gold which he gave him
becomes the price of that which is his right against him and the
food which he gave him becomes what clears what is between them.
If they do that, it becomes the sale of food before the deal is
complete.”
Mālik spoke about a man who was owed food which he had
purchased from a man and this other man was owed the like of that
food by another man. e one who owed the food said to his
creditor, “I will refer you to my debtor who owes me the same
amount of food as I owe you, so that you may obtain the food which
I owe you.”
478

Mālik said, “If the man who has to deliver the food, goes and buys
the food to pay oﬀ his creditor, that is not good. at is selling food
before taking possession of it. If the food is an advance which falls
due at that particular time, there is no harm in paying oﬀ his
creditor with it because that is not a sale. It is not lawful to sell food
before receiving it in full since the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade
that. However, the people of knowledge agree that there is no harm
in partnership, transfer of responsibility and revocation in sales of
food and other goods.”
Mālik said, “at is because the people of knowledge consider it as a
favour rendered. ey do not consider it as a sale. It is like a man
lending light dirhams. He is then paid back in dirhams of full
weight, and so gets back more than he lent. at is lawful for him
and permitted. Had a man bought defective dirhams from him as
being the full weight, that would not be lawful. Had it been
stipulated to him that he lend full weight in dirhams, and then he
gave faulty ones, that would not be lawful for him.”
55 Mālik said, “Another example of that is that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade the sale called muzābana but granted an

indulgence in the ‘ariyya for computing the equivalent in dates. It
was distinguished between them that while the muzābana-sale was
based on shrewdness and trade, the ‘ariyya sale was based on a
favour rendered and there was no shrewdness involved on it.”

Mālik said, “A man must not buy food for a fourth, a third, or a
fraction of a dirham on the basis that he be given that food on
credit. ere is no harm in a man buying food for a fraction of a
dirham on credit and then giving a dirham and taking goods with
what remains of his dirham because he gave the fraction he owed as
silver, and took goods to make up the rest of his dirham. ere is no
harm in such a transaction.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in a man placing a dirham with
another man and then taking from him agreed goods for a fourth,
third or a known fraction. If there was not an agreed price on the
479

goods and the man said, ‘I will take them from you for the price of
each day,’ this is not lawful because there is uncertainty. It might be
less one time and more another time, and they would not part with
an agreed sale.”
Mālik said, “If someone sells some food without measuring precisely
and does not exclude any of it from the sale and then it occurs to
him to buy some of it, it is not good for him to buy any of it, except
what it would be permitted for him to exclude from it: that is a
third or less. If it is more than a third, it becomes muzābana and is
disapproved. He must only purchase from what he would be
permitted to exclude, and he is only permitted to exclude a third or
less than that. is is the way of doing things in which there is no
dispute with us.”

31.24 Hoarding and raising prices by stockpiling4
4 Hoarding (ḥukra) applies to essential commodities like staple foods.
56 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb said, “ere is no hoarding in our market and men who
have excess gold in their hands should not buy up one of Allah’s
provisions, which He has sent to our courtyard, and then hoard it
up against us. Someone who brings imported goods through great
fatigue to himself in the summer and winter, such a person is the
guest of ‘Umar. Let him sell what Allah wills and keep what Allah
wills.”
57 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yūnus ibn Yūsuf from Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb passed by Ḥatab ibn Abī
Baltha‘a who was underselling some of his raisins in the market.
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said to him, “Either increase the price or leave
our market.”

480

58 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Uthmān

ibn ‘Aﬀān forbade hoarding.

31.25 What is permitted in bartering animals for other animals
and advances on animals
59 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṣāliḥ ibn Kaysān from

Ḥasan ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib that ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib
sold one of his camels called ‘Usayﬁr for twenty camels to be
delivered later.
60 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar bought a female riding-camel for four camels and guaranteed
to deliver them in full to the buyer at ar-Rabadha.

61 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik asked Ibn Shihāb about selling

animals, two for one with delayed terms. He said, “ere is no harm
in it.”

Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
is that there is no harm in bartering a camel for a camel like it and
adding some dirhams to the exchange, from hand to hand. ere is
no harm in bartering a camel for a camel like it with some dirhams
on top of the exchange, the camels to be exchanged from hand to
hand, and the dirhams to be paid within a period.”
He said, “ere is no good in bartering a camel for a camel like it
with some dirhams on top of it, with the dirhams paid immediately
and the camel to be delivered later. If both the camel and the
dirhams are deferred there is no good in that either.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in buying a riding-camel with two or
more pack-camels, if they are from inferior stock. ere is no harm
in bartering two of them for one with delayed terms if they are
diﬀerent and their diﬀerence is clear. If they resemble each other
whether their species are diﬀerent or not, two are not to be taken for
one with delayed terms.”
481

Mālik said, “e explanation of what is disapproved of in that is
that a camel should not be bought with two camels when there is no
distinction between them in speed or hardiness. If this is according
to what I have described to you, then one does not buy two of them
for one with delayed terms. ere is no harm in selling those of
them you buy before you complete the deal to somebody other than
the one from whom you brought them if you get the price in cash.”
Mālik said, “It is permitted for someone to advance something on
animals for a ﬁxed term and describe the amount and pay its price in
cash. Whatever the buyer and seller have described is obliged for
them. at is still the permitted behaviour between people and what
the people of knowledge in our land do.”

31.26 What is not permitted in the sale of animals
62 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade the transaction called

ḥabal al-ḥabala. It was a transaction which the people of Jāhiliyya
practised. A man would buy the unborn oﬀspring of the unborn
oﬀspring of a she-camel.
63 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab said, “ere is no usury in animals. ere are three
things forbidden in animals: al-maḍamīn, al-malāqīh and ḥabal alḥabala. Al-maḍāmīn is the sale of what is in the wombs of female
camels. Al-malāqīḥ is the sale of the breeding qualities of camels”
(i.e. for stud).
Mālik said, “No-one should buy a speciﬁed animal when it is
concealed from him or in another place, even if he has already seen
it very recently or not so recently and was pleased enough with it to
pay its price in cash.”
Mālik said, “at is disapproved of because the seller makes use of
the price and it is not known whether or not those goods will be
found to be as the buyer saw them or not. For that reason, it is
482

disapproved of. ere is no harm in it if it is described and
guaranteed.”

31.27 Selling animals in exchange for meat
64 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from Sa‘īd
ibn al-Musayyab that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade bartering

live animals for meat.

65 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwūd ibn al-Ḥusayn that

he heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, “Part of the gambling of the
people of Jāhiliyya was bartering live animals for slaughtered meat,
for instance, one live sheep for two slaughtered sheep.”

66 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād that Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab said, “Bartering live animals for dead meat is
forbidden.” Abū az-Zinād said, “I said to Sa‘īd ibn Musayyab,
‘What do you think of a man buying an old camel for ten sheep?’”
Sa‘īd said, “If he buys it to slaughter it, there is no good in it.”
Abū az-Zinād added, “All the people (i.e. Companions) that I have
seen forbade bartering live animals for meat.”
Abū az-Zinād said, “is used to be written in the appointment
letters of governors in the time of Abān ibn ‘Uthmān and Hishām
ibn Ismā‘īl.”

31.28 Selling meat for meat
67 Mālik said, “It is the generally agreed-on way of doing things

among us that the meat of camels, cattle, sheep and so on is not to
be bartered one for one, except like for like, weight for weight, from
hand to hand. ere is no harm in that. If it is not weighed, then it
is estimated to be like for like from hand to hand.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in bartering the meat of ﬁsh for the
meat of camels, cattle and sheep and so on two or more for one,

483

from hand to hand. If delayed terms enter into the transaction,
however, there is no good in it.”
Mālik said, “I think that poultry is diﬀerent from the meat of cattle
and ﬁsh. I see no harm in selling some of one kind for some of
another kind, more of one than another, from hand to hand. None
of that is to be sold on delayed terms.”

31.29 Selling dogs
68 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū Bakr

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām from Abū Mas‘ūd
al-Anṣārī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬made unlawful the sale of
a dog, the earnings of a prostitute and the earnings of a fortuneteller.
By the earnings of a prostitute he meant what a woman was given
for fornication. e earnings of a fortune-teller were what he was
given to tell a fortune.
Mālik said, “I disapprove of selling a dog, whether it is a hunting
dog or otherwise, because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade the
sale of a dog.”

31.30 Advance and sale of some goods for others
69 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade ‘selling and lending’.

Mālik said, “e explanation of what that means is that one man
says to another, ‘I will take your goods for such-and-such if you lend
me such-and-such,’ If they agree to a transaction in this manner, it
is not permitted. If the one who proposes the loan abandons his
proposition, then the sale is permitted.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in exchanging linen from Shata for
garments from Itribi or Qass or Ziq, or the cloth of Herat or Merv
for Yemeni cloaks and shawls and such like, as one for two or three,
484

from hand to hand or with delayed terms. If the goods are of the
same kind, and deferment enters into the transaction, there is no
good in it.”
Mālik said, “It is not good unless they are diﬀerent and the
diﬀerence between them is clear. When they resemble each other,
even if the names are diﬀerent, do not take two for one with delayed
terms, for instance, two garments of Herat for one from Merv or a
Quhy with delayed terms, or two garments of Furqub for one from
Shata. All these sorts conform to the same description, so do not
buy two for one, on delayed terms.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in selling what you buy of such
things, before you complete the deal, to someone other than the
person from whom you purchased them, if the price was paid in
cash.”

31.31 An advance on goods
70 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad said, “I heard ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās say to a
man who asked him about someone making an advance on some
garments and then wanting to sell them back before taking
possession of them, ‘at is silver for silver,’ and he disapproved of
it.”
Mālik said, “Our opinion is – and Allah knows best – that was
because he wanted to sell them to the person from whom he had
bought them for more than the price for which he bought them.
Had he sold them to someone other than the person from whom he
had purchased them, there would not have been any harm in it.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us,
concerning making an advance for slaves, cattle or goods, is that
when all of what is to be sold is described and an advance is made
for them for a date, and the date falls due, the buyer does not sell
any of that to the person from whom he purchased it for more than
485

the price which he advanced for it before he has taken full
possession of what he has advanced for it. It is usury if he does. If
the buyer gives the seller dinars or dirhams and he proﬁts with
them, then, when the goods come to the buyer and he does not take
them into his possession but sells them back to their owner for more
than what he advanced for them, the outcome is that what he has
advanced has returned to him and has been increased for him.”
Mālik said, “If someone advances gold or silver for described
animals or goods which are to be delivered before a named date, and
the date arrives, or it is before or after the date, there is no harm in
the buyer selling those goods to the seller for other goods to be
taken immediately and not delayed, no matter how extensive the
amount of those goods is, except in the case of food because it is not
lawful to sell food before he has full possession of it. e buyer can
sell those goods to someone other than the person from whom he
purchased them for gold or silver or any goods. He takes possession
of it and does not defer it because if he defers it, that is ugly and
there enters into the transaction what is disapproved of – delay for
delay. Delay for delay is to a sell debt against one man for a debt
against another man.”
Mālik said, “If someone advances for goods to be delivered after a
time, and those goods are neither something to be eaten nor drunk,
he can sell them to whomever he likes for cash or goods before he
takes delivery of them to someone other than the person from
whom he purchased them. He must not sell them to the person
from whom he bought them except in exchange for goods which he
takes possession of immediately and does not defer.”
Mālik said, “If the delivery date for the goods has not arrived, there
is no harm in selling them to the original owner for goods which are
clearly diﬀerent and which he takes immediate possession of and
does not defer.”
Mālik spoke about the case of a man who advanced dinars or
dirhams for four speciﬁed pieces of cloth to be delivered before a
486

speciﬁed time and, when the term fell due, he demanded delivery
from the seller but the seller did not have them. He found that the
seller had cloth of inferior quality, and the seller said that he would
give him eight of those cloths. Mālik said, “ere is no harm in that
if he takes the cloths which are oﬀered him before they separate. It
is not good if delayed terms enter into the transaction. It is also not
good if that is before the end of the term unless he sells him cloth
which is not the type of cloth for which he made an advance.”

31.32 Selling weighable items like copper and iron and similar
things
71 Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among

us about whatever is weighed but is not gold or silver, i.e. copper,
brass, lead, black lead, iron, herbs, ﬁgs, cotton and any such things
that are weighed, is that there is no harm in bartering all those sorts
of things two for one, hand to hand. ere is no harm in taking a
riṭl of iron for two riṭls of iron, and a riṭl of brass for two riṭls of
brass.”
Mālik said, “ere is no good in two for one of the same sort with
delayed terms. ere is no harm in taking two of one sort for one of
another on delayed terms, if the two sorts are clearly diﬀerent. If
both sorts resemble each other but their names are diﬀerent, like
lead and black lead, brass and yellow brass, I disapprove of taking
two of one sort for one of the other on delayed terms.”
Mālik said, “When buying something of this nature, there is no
harm in selling it before taking possession of it to someone other
than the person from whom it was purchased, if the price is taken
immediately and if it was bought originally by measure or weight. If
it was bought without measuring, it should be sold to someone
other than the person from whom it was bought, for cash or with
delayed terms. at is because goods have to be guaranteed when
they are bought by weight until they are weighed and the deal is
completed. is is the best of what I have heard about all these
things. It is what people continue to do among us.”
487

Mālik said, “e way of doing things among us with what is
measured or weighed of things which are not eaten or drunk, like
saﬄower, date-stones, fodder-leaves, indigo dye and suchlike, is that
there is no harm in bartering all such sorts of things two for one,
hand to hand. Do not take two for one from the same variety with
delayed terms. If the types are clearly diﬀerent, there is no harm in
taking two of one for one of the other with delayed terms. ere is
no harm in selling whatever is purchased of all these sorts, before
taking delivery of them, if the price is taken from someone other
than the person from whom they were purchased.”
Mālik said, “In the case of anything of any variety that proﬁts
people, like gravel and gypsum, one quantity of them for two of its
like with delayed terms is usury. One quantity of both of them for
its equal plus any increase with delayed terms is usury.”

31.33 Prohibition against two sales in one
72 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade two sales in one sale.
73 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that a man

said to another, “Buy this camel for me immediately so that I can
buy it from you on credit.” ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar was asked about
that and he disapproved of it and forbade it.
74 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that al-Qāsim

ibn Muḥammad was asked about a man who bought goods for ten
dinars cash or ﬁfteen dinars on credit. He disapproved of that and
forbade it.

Mālik said that if a man bought goods from a man for either ten
dinars cash or ﬁfteen dinars on credit, then one of the two prices
was obliged on the buyer. Such a thing was not to be done because if
he postponed paying the ten, it would be ﬁfteen on credit, and if he
paid the ten, he would buy with it what was worth ﬁfteen dinars on
credit.
488

Mālik said that it was disapproved of for a man to buy goods from
someone for either one dinar cash or for a described sheep on credit
and that one of the two prices was obliged on him. It was not to be
done because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade two sales in one
sale. is was a kind of two sales in the one.
Mālik spoke about a man saying to another, “I will either buy these
ﬁfteen ṣā‘s of ‘ajwa dates from you, or these ten ṣā‘s of ṣayḥānī dates,
or I will buy these ﬁfteen ṣā‘s of inferior wheat, or these ten ṣā‘s of
Syrian wheat for a dinar, and one of them is obliged on me.” Mālik
said that it was disapproved of and was not lawful. at was because
he obliged him ten ṣā‘s of ṣayḥānī, and left them and took ﬁfteen
ṣā‘s of ‘ajwa, or he was obliged ﬁfteen ṣā‘s of inferior wheat and left
them and took ten ṣā‘s of Syrian wheat. is was also disapproved
of, and was not lawful. It resembled what was prohibited in the way
of two sales in one sale. It was also included under the prohibition
against buying two for one of the same sort of food.

31.34 Transactions with uncertainty in them
75 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Ḥāzim ibn Dīnār
from Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade

the sale with uncertainty in it.

Mālik said, “An example of one type of uncertain transaction and
risk is that a man postulates the price of a stray animal or escaped
slave to be ﬁfty dinars. A man says, ‘I will take him from you for
twenty dinars.’ If the buyer ﬁnds him, the seller loses thirty dinars,
and if he does not ﬁnd him, the seller takes twenty dinars from the
buyer.”
Mālik said, “ere is another fault in that. If that stray is found, it is
not known whether it will have increased or decreased in value or
what defects may have befallen it. is transaction is full of
uncertainty and risk.”

489

Mālik said, “According to our way of doing things, one kind of
uncertain transaction and risk is selling what is in the wombs of
females – both women and animals – because it is not known
whether or not it will come out, and if it does comes out, it is not
known whether it will be beautiful or ugly, normal or disabled, male
or female. All that is disparate. If it is so, its price is such-and-such,
and if it is so, its price is such-and-such.”
Mālik said, “Females must not be sold with what is in their wombs
excluded. at is, for instance, that a man says to another, ‘e price
of my sheep which has much milk is three dinars. She is yours for
two dinars while I will have her future oﬀspring.’ is is disapproved
of because it is an uncertain transaction and a risk.”
Mālik said, “It is not lawful to sell olives for olive oil or sesame for
sesame oil, or butter for ghee because muzābana comes into that on
account of the fact that the person, who buys the raw product for
something speciﬁed which comes from it, does not know whether
more or less will come out of that, so it is an uncertain transaction
and a risk.”
Mālik said, “A similar case is the bartering of ben-nuts for ben-nut
oil. is is an uncertain transaction because what comes from the
ben-nut is ben-oil. ere is no harm in selling ben-nuts for
perfumed ben-oil because perfumed ben-oil has been perfumed,
mixed and changed from the state of raw ben-nut oil.”
Mālik, speaking about a man who sold goods to another on the
provision that there was to be no loss for the buyer (i.e. sale or
return), said, “is transaction is not permitted and it is part of risk.
e explanation of why it is so is that it is as if the seller hired the
buyer for the proﬁt if the goods make a proﬁt. If he sells the goods
at a loss, he has nothing, and his eﬀorts are not compensated. is is
not good. In such a transaction, the buyer should have a wage
according to the work that he has contributed. Whatever there is of
loss or proﬁt in such goods is for and against the seller. is is only
490

when the goods are gone and sold. If they do not go, the transaction
between them is null and void.”
Mālik said, “As for a man who buys goods from a man and then the
buyer regrets and asks to have the price reduced and the seller
refuses and says, ‘Sell it and I will compensate you for any loss,’
there is no harm in this because there is no risk. It is something he
proposes to him, and their transaction is not based on that. at is
what is done among us.”

31.35 Al-mulāmasa and al-munābadha
76 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn

Ḥabbān and from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj from Abū Hurayra
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade mulāmasa and munābadha.

Mālik said, “Mulāmasa is when a man can feel a garment but does
not know what is in it. Munābadha is that a man throws his
garment to another, and the other throws his garment without
either of them making any inspection. Each of them says, ‘is is
for this.’ is is what is forbidden of mulāmasa and munābadha.”
Mālik said that selling bundles with a list of their contents was
diﬀerent from the sale of the cloak concealed in a bag or the cloth
folded up and such things. What made it diﬀerent was that it was a
common practice which people were familiar with, and which
people had done in the past, and it was still among the permitted
transactions and trading of people in which they saw no harm,
because in the sale of bundles with a list of contents without
undoing them, an uncertain transaction was not intended and it did
not resemble mulāmasa.

31.36 Murābaḥa transactions (partnership between investors and
borrowers in proﬁt-sharing re-sales)
77 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on

way of doing things among us, about a man buying cloth in one city
and then taking it to another city to sell as a murābaḥa, is that he is
491

not reckoned to have the wage of an agent or any allowance for
ironing, folding, straightening, expenses, or the rent of a house. As
for the cost of transporting the drapery, it is included in the basic
price and no share of the proﬁt is allocated to it unless the agent
tells all of that to the investor. If they agree to share the proﬁts
accordingly after knowledge of it, there is no harm in that.”
Mālik continued, “As for bleaching, tailoring, dyeing and such
things, they are treated in the same way as drapery. e proﬁt is
reckoned in them as it is reckoned in drapery goods. So if he sells
the drapery goods without clarifying the things we named as not
getting proﬁt, and the drapery has already gone, the transport is to
be reckoned, but no proﬁt is given. If the drapery goods have not
gone, the transaction between them is null and void, unless they
make a new mutual agreement on what is to be permitted between
them.”
Mālik spoke about an agent who bought goods for gold or silver and
the exchange rate on the day of purchase was ten dirhams to the
dinar. He took them to a city to sell as a murābaḥa, or sold them
where he purchased them according to the exchange rate of the day
on which he sold them. If he bought them for dirhams and sold
them for dinars, or he bought them for dinars and sold them for
dirhams, and the goods had not gone, then he had a choice. If he
wished, he could accept to sell the goods, and if he wished, he could
leave them. If the goods had been sold, he had the price for which
the salesman bought them, and the salesman was reckoned to have
the proﬁt on what they were bought for, over what the investor
gained as proﬁt.
Mālik said, “If a man sells goods worth one hundred dinars for one
hundred and ten, and he hears afterwards that they are worth ninety
dinars, and the goods have gone, the seller has a choice. If he likes,
he has the price of the goods on the day they were taken from him,
unless the price is more than the price for which he was obliged to
sell them in the ﬁrst place, and he does not have more than that –
492

and it is one hundred and ten dinars. If he likes, it is counted as
proﬁt against ninety unless the price his goods reached was less than
the value. He is given the choice between what his goods fetch and
the capital plus the proﬁt, which is ninety-nine dinars.”
Mālik said, “If someone sells goods on the basis of a murābaḥa [cost
plus sale] and says, ‘If was valued for me at one hundred dinars,’ and
then ﬁnds later on that its value was one hundred and twenty dinars,
the buyer is given a choice: he can give the buyer the price of the
goods if he so wishes, or, if he wishes, he can give him the price for
which he bought them based on reckoning the amount of the proﬁt
achieved in them, whatever it is, provided that it is not less than the
price for which he purchased the goods. He should not give the
owner of the goods a loss in the price for which he bought them
because he consented to that. e owner of the goods cam to seek
more, so the buyer has no argument against the seller in this by
which he can reduce the price for which he bought them according
to the list of contents.”

31.37 Sales according to a list of contents
78 Mālik spoke about what was done among them in the case of a

group of people which buys goods, drapery or slaves, when a man,
hearing about it, says to one of the group, “I have heard the
description and situation of the drapery goods you bought from soand-so, shall I give you such-and-such proﬁt to take over your
portion?” is person agrees, and the man gives him the proﬁt and
becomes a partner in his place. en, when he looks at the purchase,
he sees that is was ugly and ﬁnds it too expensive.

Mālik said, “It is obliged on him and there is no choice in it for him
if he buys it according to a list of contents and the description is
well-known.”
Mālik spoke about a man who has had drapery goods sent to him,
and merchants come to him and he reads to them his list of contents
and says, “In each bag is such-and-such a wrap from Basra and
493

such-and-such a light wrap from Sabir. eir size is such-andsuch,” and he names to them types of drapery goods by their sort
and says, “Buy them from me according to this description.” ey
buy the bags according to how he has described them and then,
having bought them, they ﬁnd them too expensive and regret it.
Mālik said, “e sale is binding on them if the goods agree with the
list of contents against which he sold them.”
Mālik said, “is is the way of doing things which people still use
today. ey permit the sale which names the items when the goods
agree with the list of contents and are not diﬀerent from it.”

31.38 e right of withdrawal (khiyār)
79 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Both parties in a

business transaction have the right of withdrawal as long as they
have not separated, unless it is a sale subject to an option.”

Mālik said, “ere is no speciﬁed limit nor any matter which is
applied in this case according to us.”
80 Mālik related to me that he had heard that ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd
used to relate that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When two

parties dispute about a business transaction, the seller’s word is
taken, or they agree to annul the sale.”
Mālik spoke about someone who sells goods to a man and says
when the sale is contracted, “I will sell to you provided I consult soand-so. If he is satisﬁed, the sale is permitted. If he dislikes it, there
is no sale between us.” ey make the transaction on this basis and
then the buyer regrets the transaction before the seller has consulted
the person.
Mālik said, “e sale is binding on them according to what they
described. e buyer has no right of withdrawal and the sale is
binding on him if the person whom the seller stipulates to him
permits it.”
494

Mālik said, “e way of doing things among us about a man who
buys goods from another and they diﬀer about the price, and the
seller says, ‘I sold them to you for ten dinars,’ and the buyer says, ‘I
bought them from you for ﬁve dinars,’ is that it is said to the seller,
‘If you like, give them to the buyer for what he has mentioned. If
you like, swear by Allah that you only sold your goods for what you
have mentioned.’ If he swears it is said to the buyer, ‘Either you take
the goods for what the seller has mentioned or you swear by Allah
that you bought them only for what you have mentioned.’ If he
swears, he is free to return the goods. at is when each of them
testiﬁes against the other.”

31.39 Usury in debts
81 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from Busr

ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Ubayd Abū Ṣālih, the mawlā of aṣ-Ṣaﬀāh, that he
said, “I sold some drapery to the people of Dār Nakhla on credit.
en I wanted to go to Kufa, so they proposed that I reduced the
price for them and they would pay me immediately. I asked Zayd
ibn ābit about it and he said, ‘I order you not to accept increase or
to allow it to anybody.’”
82 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Uthmān ibn Ḥafṣ ibn

Khalda from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn ‘Abdullāh that ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Umar was asked about a man who took a loan from another
man for a set term. e creditor reduced the debt and the man paid
it immediately. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar disliked that and forbade it.
83 Mālik related to me that Zayd ibn Aslam said, “Usury in the

Jāhiliyya was that a man would give a loan to a man for a set term.
When the term was due, he would say, ‘Will you pay it oﬀ or
increase me?’ If the man paid he took it. If not, he increased him in
his debt and lengthened the term for him.”
Mālik said, “e disapproved way of doing things about which there
is no dispute among us is that a man gives a loan to a man for a
term and then the demander reduces it and the one from whom it is
495

demanded pays it in advance. To us that is like someone who delays
repaying his debt after it is due to his creditor and his creditor
increases his debt.” Mālik said, “is is nothing else but usury – no
doubt about it.”
Mālik spoke about a man who loaned one hundred dinars to a man
for two terms. When it was due, the person who owed the debt said
to him, “Sell me some goods whose price is one hundred dinars in
cash for one hundred and ﬁfty on credit.” Mālik said, “is
transaction is not good, and the people of knowledge still forbid it.”
Mālik said, “is is disapproved of because the creditor gives the
debtor the price of what the man sells him, and he defers payment
of the hundred of the ﬁrst transaction for the debtor for the term
which is mentioned to him in the second transaction, and the
debtor increases him with ﬁfty dinars for deferring him. at is
disapproved of and it is not good. It also resembles the ḥadīth of
Zayd ibn Aslam about the transactions of the people of the
Jāhiliyya. When their loans came, they said to the person with the
debt, ‘Either you pay in full or you increase it.’ If they paid, they
took it. If not they increased the debtors in their debts and extended
the term for them.”

31.40 Debts and transfer of debts in general
84 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“Delay in payment by a rich man is injustice, but when one of you is
referred to a solvent man for payment, let him accept the referral.”

85 Mālik related to me from Mūsā ibn Maysara that he heard a man

say to Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab, “I am a man who sells for a debt.”
Sa‘īd said, “Do not sell except for what you take directly to your
camel.”

Mālik spoke about a person who buys goods from a man provided
that he provides him with those goods by a speciﬁc date, either in
496

time for a market in which he hopes that he can sell them, or to
fulﬁll a need whose time he stipulates. en the seller fails him
about the date and the buyer wants to return the goods to the seller.
Mālik said, “e buyer cannot do that, and the sale is binding on
him. If the seller does bring the goods before the completion of the
term, the buyer cannot be forced to take them.”
Mālik spoke about a person who buys food and measures it. en
someone comes to him to buy it and he tells him that he has
measured it for himself and taken it in full. e new buyer wants to
trust him and accept his measure. Mālik said, “Whatever is sold in
this way for cash has no harm in it, but whatever is sold in this way
on delayed terms is disapproved of until the new buyer measures it
out for himself. e sale with delayed terms is disapproved of
because it leads to usury and it is feared that goods will be circulated
in this way without weight or measure. If the terms are delayed it is
disapproved of and there is no disagreement about that with us.”
Mālik said, “One should not buy a debt owed by a man whether
present or absent, without the conﬁrmation of the one who owes the
debt, nor should one buy a debt owed to a man by a dead person
even if one knows what the deceased man has left. at is because
to buy it is an uncertain transaction and one does not know whether
the transaction will be completed or not.”
He said, “e explanation of what is disapproved of in buying a debt
owed by someone absent or dead is that it is not known what
unknown debtors may have claims on the dead person. If the dead
person is liable for another debt, the price which the buyer gives on
strength of the debt may become worthless.”
Mālik said, “ere is another fault in that as well. He is buying
something which is not guaranteed for him and so, if the deal is not
completed, what he has paid becomes worthless. is is an uncertain
transaction and it is not good.”

497

Mālik said, “One distinguishes between a man who is only selling
what he actually has and a man who is being paid in advance for
something which is not yet in his possession. e man advancing
the money brings his gold which he intends to buy with. e seller
says, ‘is is ten dinars. What do you want me to buy for you with
it?’ It is as if he sold ten dinars cash for ﬁfteen dinars to be paid
later. Because of this, it is disapproved of. It is something leading to
usury and fraud.”

31.41 Partnership, transferral of responsibility to an agent and
revocation
86 Mālik said that there was no harm if a man who was selling some

drapery, and had excluded some garments by their markings,
stipulated that he would chose the marked ones from that. If he did
not stipulate that he would choose from them when he made the
exclusion, I think that he is partner in the number of drapery goods
which were purchased from him. at is because two garments can
be alike in marking and greatly diﬀerent in price.
Mālik said, “e way of doing things among us is that there is no
harm in partnership, transferring responsibility to an agent and
revocation when dealing with food and other things, whether or not
possession was taken, when the transaction is with cash, and there is
no proﬁt, loss or deferment of its price. If proﬁt or loss or deferment
of the price from one of the two enters any of these transactions, it
becomes a sale which is made lawful by what makes sales lawful, and
made unlawful by what makes sale unlawful, and it is not
partnership, transferring responsibility to an agent, or revocation.”
Mālik spoke about someone who bought drapery goods or slaves,
and the sale was concluded, then a man asked him to be his partner
and he agreed and the new partner paid the whole price to the seller
and then something happened to the goods which removed them
from their possession. Mālik said, “e new partner takes the price
from the original partner and the original partner demands from the
seller the whole price, unless the original partner stipulated on the
498

new partner during the sale and before the transaction with the
seller was completed that the seller was responsible to him. If the
transaction has ended and the seller has gone, the precondition of
the original partner is void and the responsibility is his.”
Mālik spoke about a man who asked another man to buy certain
goods to share between them, and he wanted the other man to pay
for him and he would sell the goods for the other man. Mālik said,
“at is not good. When he says, ‘Pay for me and I will sell it for
you,’ it becomes a loan which he makes to him in order that he sell
it for him and, if those goods are destroyed or perish, the man who
paid the price will demand from his partner what he put in for him.
is is part of the advance which brings in proﬁt.”
Mālik said, “If a man buys goods and the sale is completed, and
then a man says to him, ‘Share half of these goods with me and I
will sell them all for you,’ that is lawful and there is no harm in it.
e explanation of that is that this is a new sale and he sells him
half of the goods provided that he sells the entire lot.”

31.42 Bankruptcy of debtors
87 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū Bakr

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whenever a man sells wares and then the buyer
becomes bankrupt and the seller has not taken any of the price and
he ﬁnds some of his property intact with the buyer, he is more
entitled to it than anyone else. If the buyer dies, then the seller is the
same as other creditors with respect to it.”
88 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Abū

Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd
al-‘Azīz from Abū Bakr ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn
Hishām from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If
anyone goes bankrupt and a man ﬁnds his own property intact with
him, he is more entitled to it than anyone else.”

499

Mālik spoke about a man who sold a man wares and the buyer went
bankrupt. He said, “e seller takes whatever he ﬁnds of his goods.
If the buyer has sold some of them and distributed them, the seller
of the wares is more entitled to them than the creditors. What the
buyer has distributed does not prevent the seller from taking
whatever of it he ﬁnds. It is the seller’s right if he has received any of
the price from the buyer and he wants to return it to take what he
ﬁnds of his wares, and in what he does not ﬁnd he is like the other
creditors.”
Mālik spoke about someone who bought spun wool or a plot of
land, and then did some work on it, like building a house on the
plot of land or weaving the spun wool into cloth. en he went
bankrupt after he had bought it and the original owner of the plot
said, “I will take the plot and whatever structure is on it.” Mālik
said, “at structure is not his. However, the plot and what is on it
that the buyer has improved is appraised. en one sees what the
price of the plot is, and how much of that value is the price of the
structure. ey are partners in that. e owner of the plot has as
much as his portion, and the creditors have the amount of the
portion of the structure.”
Mālik said, “e explanation of that is that the value of it all is
ﬁfteen hundred dirhams, and the value of the building is one
thousand dirhams. e owner of the plot has a third, and the
creditors have two-thirds.”
Mālik said, “It is like that with spinning and other things of a
similar nature in such circumstances when the buyer has a debt
which he cannot repay. is is the normative practice in such cases.”
Mālik said, “As for goods which have been sold and which the buyer
has not improved, but those goods sell well and have gone up in
price, so their owner wants them and the creditors also want them,
then the creditors can choose between giving the owner of the goods
the price for which he sold them and not giving him any loss and
surrendering his goods to him.
500

“If the price of the goods has gone down, the one who sold them
has a choice. If he likes, he can take his goods and then he has no
claim to any of his debtor’s property, and that is his right. If he likes,
he can be one of the creditors and take a portion of his due and not
take his goods. at is up to him.”
Mālik said about someone who bought a slave-girl or animal and
she gave birth while in his possession and then the buyer went
bankrupt: “e slave-girl or the animal and the oﬀspring belong to
the seller unless the creditors desire it. In that case they give him his
complete due and then they take it.”

31.43 What is permitted of free loans
89 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Atā’
ibn Yasār that Abū Rāﬁ‘, the mawlā of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬,
said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬borrowed a young camel and then

the camels from the zakāt came to him.”

Abū Rāﬁ‘ said, “He ordered me to repay the man his young camel. I
said, ‘I can only ﬁnd a good camel in its seventh year among the
camels.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Give it to him. e best of
people are those who discharge their debts in the best manner.’”
90 Mālik related to me from Ḥumayd ibn Qays al-Makkī that

Mujāhid said, “‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar borrowed some dirhams from a
man, then he discharged his debt with dirhams better than them.
e man said, “Abū ‘Abd ar-Rahmān, these are better than the
dirhams which I lent you.’ ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, ‘I know that.
But I am happy to do that.’”

Mālik said, “ere is no harm in a person who has lent gold, silver,
food or animals taking something better than what was lent when
that is not a stipulation between them nor a custom. If that is by a
stipulation or promise or custom, then it is disapproved, and there is
no good in it.”

501

He explained, “at is because the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
discharged his debt with a good camel in its seventh year in place of
a young camel which he borrowed, and ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar
borrowed some dirhams and repaid them with better ones. If that is
from the goodness of the borrower, and it is not by a stipulation,
promise or custom, it is lawful and there is no harm in it.”

31.44 What is not permitted of free loans
91 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb said that he disapproved of one man lending another
food on the condition that he gave it back to him in another city.
He said, “Where is the transport?”
92 Mālik related to me that he had heard that a man came to

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar and said, “Abū ‘Abd ar-Rahmān, I gave a man
a loan and stipulated that he gave me better than what I lent him.”
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “at is usury.”
‘Abdullāh said, “Loans are of three types. A free loan which you
lend by which you desire the pleasure of Allah, and so you have the
pleasure of Allah. A free loan which you lend by which you desire
the pleasure of your companion, so you have the pleasure of your
companion. And a free loan which you lend by which you take what
is impure by what is pure, and that is usury.” He said, “What do you
order me to do, Abū ‘Abd ar-Raḥman?” He said, “I think that you
should tear up the agreement. If he gives you less than what you lent
him, take it and you will be rewarded. If he gives you better than
what you lent him of his own good will, that is his gratitude to you
and you have the wage of the period you gave him the loan.”
93 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that he heard

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar say, “If someone lends something, let the only
condition be that it is repaid.”
94 Mālik related to me that he had heard that ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd

used to say, “If someone makes a loan, they should not stipulate
502

better than it. Even if it is a handful of grass, it is usury.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of doing things among us
is that there is no harm in borrowing any animals with a set
description and itemisation, and one must return the like of them.
is is not done in the case of female slaves. It is clear that it would
lead to making lawful what is not lawful, so it is not good. e
explanation of what is disapproved of in that, is that a man borrow a
slave-girl and have intercourse with her as seems proper to him.
en he returns her to her owner. at is not good and it is not
lawful. e people of knowledge still forbid it and do not give an
indulgence to anyone in it.”

31.45 What is forbidden of haggling and such transactions
95 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “None of you should

make a sale overriding the sale of his brother.”

96 Mālik related to me from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do not go out to

meet the caravans for trade, do not bid against each other,
outbidding in order to raise the price, and a townsman must not buy
on behalf of a man of the desert, and do not tie up the udders of
camels and sheep so that they appear to have a lot of milk, for a
person who buys them after that has two recourses open to him
after he milks them. If he is pleased with them, he keeps them and
if he is displeased with them, he can return them along with a ṣā‘ of
dates.”

Mālik said, “e explanation of the words of the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬according to what we think – and Allah knows best – ‘do
not bid against each other’ is that it is forbidden for a man to oﬀer a
price over the price of his brother when the seller has inclined to the
bargainer and made conditions about the weight of the gold and he
has declared himself not liable for faults and such things by which it

503

is recognised that the seller wants to make a transaction with the
bargainer. is is what he forbade, and Allah knows best.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm, however, in more than one person
bidding against each other over goods put up for sale.”
He said, “Were people to abandon haggling when the ﬁrst person
starts to haggle an unreal price might be taken and the disapproved
would enter into the sale of the goods. is is still the way of doing
things among us.”
97 Mālik

said from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade najsh.
Mālik said, “Najsh is to oﬀer a man more than the worth of his
goods when you do not mean to buy them and someone else follows
you in the bidding.”

31.46 Business transactions in general
98 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār from

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that a man mentioned to the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬that he was always being cheated in business transactions.
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When you enter a transaction say,
‘No trickery.’ So whenever that man entered a transaction, he would
say, ‘No trickery.’”
99 Mālik related to me that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard Sa‘īd ibn al-

Musayyab say, “When you come to a land where they give full
measure and full weight, stay there. When you come to a land where
they shorten the measure and weight, then do not stay there very
long.”
100 Mālik

related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he heard
Muḥammad ibn al-Munkadir say, “Allah loves his slave who is
generous when he sells and generous when he buys, generous when
he repays and generous when he asks for repayment.”
504

Mālik said about a man who bought camels or sheep or dry goods or
slaves or any goods without measuring precisely, “ere is no buying
without measuring precisely in anything which can be counted.”
Mālik spoke about a man who gave a man goods to sell for him and
set their price saying, “If you sell them for this price as I have
ordered you to do, you will have a dinar (or something which he has
speciﬁed which they are both satisﬁed with), if you do not sell them,
you will have nothing.” He said, “ere is no harm in that when he
names a price to sell them at and names a known fee. If he sells the
goods, he takes the fee, and if he does not sell them, he has
nothing.”
Mālik said, “is is like saying to another man, ‘If you capture my
runaway slave or bring my stray camel, you will have such-andsuch.’ is falls into the category of reward and not the category of
giving a wage. If it had been in the category of giving a wage, it
would not be good.”
Mālik said, “As for a man who is given goods and told that, if he
sells them, he will have a named percentage for every dinar, that is
not good because whenever there is a dinar less than the price of the
goods, he decreases the due which was named for him. is is an
uncertain transaction. He does not know how much he will be
given.”
101 Mālik related to me that he asked Ibn Shihāb about a man who

hired an animal and then re-hired it out for more than what he
hired it for. He said, “ere is no harm in that.”

505

32. Qirāḍ
32.1 Qirāḍ
1 Mālik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that his father said,

“‘Abdullāh and ‘Ubaydullāh, the sons of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, left
with the army for Iraq. On the way home, they passed by Abū Mūsā
al-Ash‘arī, the Amīr of Basra. He greeted them and made them
welcome and told them that if there was anything he could do to
help them, he would do it. en he said, ‘ere is some of the
property of Allah which I want to send to the Amīr al-Mu’minīn, so
I will lend it to you and you can buy wares from Iraq and sell them
in Madīna. en give the principal to the Amīr al-Mu’minīn, and
you keep the proﬁt.’ ey said that they would like to do that, and
so he gave them the money and wrote to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb to
take the money from them. When they came to sell they made a
proﬁt. When they paid the principal to ‘Umar he asked, ‘Did he
lend everyone in the army the like of what he lent you?’ ey said,
‘No.’ ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, ‘He made you the loan because you
are the sons of the Amīr al-Mu’minīn, so pay the principal and the
proﬁt.’ ‘Abdullāh was silent. ‘Ubaydullāh said, ‘You do not need to
do this, Amīr al-Mu’minīn. Had the principal decreased or been
destroyed, we would have guaranteed it.’ ‘Umar said, ‘Pay it.’
‘Abdullāh was silent and ‘Ubaydullāh repeated what he had said. A
man who was sitting with ‘Umar said, ‘Amīr al-Mu’minīn, better
that you make it a qirāḍ loan.’ ‘Umar said, ‘I have made it a qirāḍ.’
‘Umar then took the principal and half of the proﬁt, and ‘Abdullāh
and ‘Ubaydullāh, the sons of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, took half of the
proﬁt.”
2 Mālik related to me from al-‘Alā’ ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān from his

father from his father that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān gave him some
money as qirāḍ to use provided the proﬁt was shared between them.

32.2 What is permitted in qirāḍ
506

3 Mālik said, “e recognised and permitted form of qirāḍ is that a

man take capital from an associate to use. He does not guarantee it
and in travelling pays out of the capital for food and clothes and
what he makes good use of, according to the amount of capital. at
is, when he travels to do the work and the capital can support of it.
If he remains with his people, he does not have expenses for
clothing from the capital.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in the two parties in a qirāḍ helping
each other by way of a favour when it is acceptable to them both.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in the investor of the capital buying
some of the goods from the agent in the qirāḍ if that is acceptable
and without conditions.”
Mālik spoke about an investor making a qirāḍ loan to a man and his
slave, to be used by both. He said, “at is permitted, and there is
no harm in it because the proﬁt is property for his slave, and the
proﬁt is not for the master until he takes it from him. It is like the
rest of his earnings.”

32.3 What is not permitted in qirāḍ
4 Mālik said, “When a man owes money to another man and he

asks him to let it stay with him as a qirāḍ, that is disapproved of
until the creditor receives his property. en he can make it a qirāḍ
loan or keep it. at is because the debtor may be in a tight situation
and want him to defer that for an increase it in it.”

Mālik spoke about an investor who made a qirāḍ loan to a man in
which some of the principal was lost before being used. en he
used it and realised a proﬁt. e agent wanted to make the principal
the remainder of the money after what was lost from it.
Mālik said, “His statement is not accepted, and the principal is
made up to its original amount from his proﬁt. en they divide
what remains after the principal has been repaid according to the
conditions of the qirāḍ.”
507

Mālik said, “A qirāḍ loan is only good in gold and silver coin and it
is never permitted in any kind of wares or goods or articles.”
Mālik said, “ere are certain transactions whose revocation
becomes unacceptable if a long span of time passes after the
transaction takes place. As for usury, there is never anything except
its rejection whether it is a little or a lot. What is permitted in other
than it is not permitted in it because Allah, the Blessed and the
Exalted, said in His Book, ‘But if you turn in repentance you may
have your capital, without wronging and without being wronged.’
(2:279)”

32.4 Conditions permitted in qirāḍ
5 Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about an investor who made a qirāḍ

loan and stipulated to the agent that only certain goods should be
bought with his money or he forbade that certain goods, which he
named, be bought. He said, “ere is no harm in an investor
making a condition on an agent in qirāḍ not to buy a certain kind of
animal or goods which he speciﬁes. It is disapproved of for an
investor to make a such condition on an agent in qirāḍ unless what
he orders him to buy is in plentiful supply and does not fail in
winter or summer. ere is no harm in that case.”
Mālik spoke about an investor who loaned qirāḍ money and
stipulated that a set sum out of the proﬁt should be his alone
without the agent sharing in it. He said, “at is not good, even if it
is only one dirham – unless he stipulates that half the proﬁt is his
and half the proﬁt is the agent’s or a third or a fourth or whatever.
When he names a percentage, whether great or small, everything
speciﬁed by that is lawful. is is the qirāḍ of the Muslims.”
He said, “It is also not good if the investor stipulates that one
dirham or more of the proﬁt is purely his, without the agent sharing
it and then what remains of the proﬁt to be divided in half between
them. at is not the qirāḍ of the Muslims.”

508

32.5 Conditions not permitted in qirāḍ
6 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e person who puts up the principal

must not stipulate that he has a portion of the proﬁt alone without
the agent sharing in it, nor must the agent stipulate that he has a
portion of the proﬁt alone without the investor sharing. In qirāḍ,
there is no sale, no rent, no work, no advance, and no convenience
which one party speciﬁes to himself without the other party sharing,
unless one party allows it to the other unconditionally as a favour
which is accepted by both. Neither of the parties should make a
condition over the other which increases him in gold or silver or
food over the other party.”
He said, “If any of that enters into the qirāḍ, it becomes hire, and
hire is only good when it has known and ﬁxed terms. e agent
should not stipulate when he takes the principal that he repay or
commission speciﬁc persons with the goods, nor that he take any of
them for himself. When there is a proﬁt, and it is time to separate
the capital, then they divide the proﬁt according to the terms of the
contract. If the principal does not increase or there is a loss, the
agent does not have to make up for what he spent on himself or for
the loss. at falls to the investor from the principal. Qirāḍ is
permitted upon whatever terms the investor and the agent make a
mutual agreement – half the proﬁt, or a third, or a fourth, or
whatever.”
Mālik said, “It is not permitted for the agent to stipulate that he use
the qirāḍ for a certain number of years and that it not be taken back
from him during that time.”
He said, “It is not good for the investor to stipulate that the qirāḍ
money should not be returned for a certain number of years which
are speciﬁed, because the qirāḍ is not for a term. e investor loans
it to an agent to use for him. If it seems proper to either of them to
abandon the project and the money is coin, and nothing has been
bought with it, it can be abandoned and the investor takes back his
money. If it seems proper to the investor to take the qirāḍ loan back
509

after goods have been purchased with it, he cannot do so until the
buyer has sold the goods and they have become money. If it seems
proper to the agent to return the loan, and it has been turned to
goods, he cannot do so until he has sold them. He returns the loan
in cash as he took it.”
Mālik said, “It is not good for the investor to stipulate that the agent
pay any zakāt due from his portion of the proﬁt in particular,
because by stipulating that, the investor stipulates ﬁxed increase for
himself from the proﬁt because the portion of zakāt he would be
liable for by his portion of the proﬁt is removed from him.
“Nor is it permitted for the investor to stipulate to the agent to only
buy from so-and-so, referring to a speciﬁc man. at is not
permitted because by doing so he would become his hireling for a
wage.”
Mālik said about an investor in qirāḍ who stipulated a guarantee for
an amount of money from the agent, “e investor is not permitted
to stipulate conditions about his principal other than the conditions
on which qirāḍ is based or according to the precedent of the sunna
of the Muslims. If the principal is increased by the condition of
guarantee, the investor has increased his share of the proﬁt because
of the position of the guarantee. But the proﬁt is only to be divided
according to what it would have been had the loan been given
without the guarantee. If the principal is destroyed, I do not think
that the agent has a guarantee held against him, because the
stipulation of guarantee in qirāḍ is null and void.”
Mālik spoke about an investor who gave qirāḍ money to a man and
the man stipulated that he would only buy palms or animals with it
because he sought to eat the dates or the oﬀspring of the animals
and he kept them for some time to use for himself. He said, “at is
not permitted. It is not the sunna of the Muslims in qirāḍ unless he
buys it and then sells it as other goods are sold.”

510

Mālik said, “ere is no harm in the agent stipulating on the
investor the inclusion of a slave to help him, provided that the slave
stands to gain along with them out of the investment, and when the
slave only helps him with the investment, not with anything else.”

32.6 Qirāḍ in Wares
7 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “No one should make a qirāḍ loan

except in coin because the loan must not be in wares since loaning
wares can only be worked in one of two ways: either the owner of
the wares says to the agent, ‘Take these wares and sell them. Buy
and sell with the capital realized according to qirāḍ.’ e investor
stipulates increase for himself from the sale of his goods and what
relieves him of expense in selling it. Or else he says, ‘Barter with
these goods and sell. When you are through, buy for me the like of
my goods which I gave you. If there is increase, it is between you
and me.’ It may happen that the investor gives the goods to the
agent at a time in which they are in demand and expensive, and
then the agent returns them while they are cheap and having
perhaps bought them for only a third of the original price or even
less than that. e agent then has a proﬁt of half the amount, by
which the price of the wares has decreased, as his portion of the
proﬁt. Or he might take the wares at a time when their price is low
and make use of them until he has a lot of money. en those wares
become expensive and their price rises when he returns them, so he
buys them for all that he has, so that all his work and concern have
been in vain. is is an uncertain transaction and it is not good. If,
however, that is not known until it has happened, then the wage an
agent in qirāḍ would be paid for selling that is looked at and he is
given it for his concern. en the money is qirāḍ from the day the
money became cash and collected as coin and it is returned as a
qirāḍ like that.”

32.7 Hire in qirāḍ
8 Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about a man who made a qirāḍ loan

to a man and he bought wares with it and transported them to a
511

commercial centre. It was not proﬁtable to sell them and the agent
feared a loss if he sold them, so he hired transport to take them to
another city, and he sold them there and made a loss, and the cost of
the hire was greater than the principal.
Mālik said, “If the agent can pay the cost of the hire from what the
wares realize, his way is that. Whatever portion of the hire is not
covered by the principal, the agent must pay. e investor is not
answerable for any of it. at is because the investor only ordered
him to trade with the principal. e investor is not answerable for
other than the principal. Had the investor been liable, it would have
been an additional loss to him on top of the principal which he
invested. e agent cannot put that onto the investor.”

32.8 Overstepping in qirāḍ
9 Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about an investor who made a qirāḍ

loan to a man who used it and made a proﬁt. en the man bought
a slave-girl with all the proﬁt and he had intercourse with her and
she became pregnant by him, and so the capital decreased. Mālik
said, “If he has money, the price of the slave-girl is taken from his
property, and the capital is restored by it. If there is something left
over after the money is paid, it is divided between them according to
the ﬁrst qirāḍ. If he cannot pay it, the slave-girl is sold so that the
capital is restored from her price.”
Mālik spoke about an investor who made a qirāḍ loan to a man, and
the agent spent more than the amount of the qirāḍ loan when
buying goods with it and paid the increase from his own money.
Mālik said, “e investor has a choice if the goods are sold for a
proﬁt or loss or if they are not sold. If he wishes to take the goods,
he takes them and pays the agent back what he put in for them. If
the agent refuses, the investor is a partner for his share of the price
in either increase and decrease according to what the agent paid
extra for them from himself.”

512

Mālik spoke about an agent who took qirāḍ money from a man and
then gave it to another man to use as a qirāḍ without the consent of
the investor. He said, “e agent is responsible for the property. If it
is decreased, he is responsible for the loss. If there is a proﬁt, the
investor has his stipulation of the proﬁt and then the agent has his
stipulation of what remains of the money.”
Mālik spoke about an agent who exceeded and borrowed some of
the qirāḍ money he had and bought goods for himself with it. Mālik
said, “If he has a proﬁt, the proﬁt is divided according to the
condition between them in the qirāḍ. If he has a loss, he is
responsible for the loss.”
Mālik said about an investor who paid money to a man and the
agent borrowed some of the cash and bought goods for himself with
it, “e investor of the capital has a choice. If he wishes, he shares
with him in the goods according to the qirāḍ and, if he wishes, he
frees himself of them, and takes all of the principal back from qirāḍ
agent. at is what is done with someone who oversteps.”

32.9 Expenses permitted in qirāḍ
10 Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about an investor who made a qirāḍ

loan to man. Mālik said, “When the investment is large, the
travelling expenses of the agent are taken from it. He can use it to
eat and clothe himself in an acceptable fashion according to the size
of the investment. If it saves him from trouble he can take a wage
from some of the capital if it is large and he cannot support himself.
ere are certain jobs which an agent or his like are not responsible
for. Amongst them are collecting debts, transporting the goods,
loading up and so forth. He can use the capital to hire someone to
do that for him. e agent should not spend from the capital nor
clothe himself from it while he resides with his family. It is only
permitted for him to have expenses when he travels for the
investment. e expenses are taken from the capital. If he is only
trading with the property in the city in which he resides, he has no
expenses or clothing from the capital.”
513

Mālik spoke about an investor who paid qirāḍ money to an agent
who went out with it and with his own capital. He said, “e
expenses come from the qirāḍ and from his own capital according to
their proportions.”

32.10 Expenses not permitted in qirāḍ
11 Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about an agent who had qirāḍ money

with him and he spent from it and clothed himself. He said, “He
cannot give away any of it, and neither a beggar nor anyone else is to
be given any of it and he does not pay anyone compensation from it.
If he meets some people and they bring out food and he brings out
food, I hope it will be permitted for him to do so if he does not
intend to bestow something on them. If he intends to do that or
something like that without the permission of the investor, he must
ﬁrst get the sanction of the investor for it. If he sanctions it, there is
no harm. If he refuses to sanction it, then he must repay it with like
as compensation if he has something which is suitable.”

32.11 Debts in qirāḍ
12 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e generally agreed-on way of

doing things among us about an investor, who extends qirāḍ money
to an agent to buy goods, and the agent then sells the goods for a
price to be paid later and has a proﬁt in the transaction, and then
the agent dies before he has received payment, is that, if his heirs
want to take that money, they have their father’s stipulated portion
from the proﬁt. at is theirs if they are trustworthy enough to take
the payment. If they dislike collecting it from the debtor and they
refer him to the investor, they are not obliged to collect it and there
is nothing against them and nothing for them by their surrendering
it to the investor. If they do collect it, they have a share of it and
expenses, just as their father had. ey take the place of their father.
If they are not trustworthy enough to do so, they can bring someone
reliable and trustworthy to collect the money. If he collects all the
capital and all the proﬁt, they are in the same position as their father
was.”
514

Mālik spoke about an investor who extended qirāḍ money to a man
provided that he used it and was responsible for any delayed
payment for which he sold it. He said, “is is an obligation on the
agent. If he sells it for delayed payment, he is responsible for it.”

32.12 Goods in qirāḍ
13 Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about the case when a man gives

qirad money to another man and then that man asked the investor
for a loan, or the investor asked him for a loan, or the investor left
some goods with that man to sell for him, or gave him some dinars
with which to purchase merchandise for him. Mālik said, “ere is
nothing wrong if the investor leaves his goods with him when he
knows that if he had asked the agent to do that when that agent was
not in possession of his money, he would have done it because of the
brotherhood existing between them or because that would have not
been a burden for him, and also that if the agent had refused to do
that, he would not have removed his money from him, or if the
agent borrows from the investor or carries goods for him when he
knows that if he had not had his money, he would still have done
the same for him, and if he were to refuse to do that, he would not
have demanded the return of his money. If that is true of both of
them and it is by way of a mark of friendship between them and not
a stipulation in the terms of the qirad, it is permitted and there is no
harm in it. If there is a stipulation involved in that, or it is feared
that the agent is doing that for the investor to ensure that he retains
possession of his capital, or the investor does that because the agent
is withholding his capital and will not return it to him, that is not
permitted in a qirāḍ and it is part of what the people of knowledge
forbid.”

32.13 Loans in qirāḍ
14 Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about a man who loaned another

man money and then the debtor asked him to leave it with him as a
qirāḍ. Mālik said, “I do not like that unless he takes his money back
515

from him, and then pays it to him as a qirāḍ, if he wishes, or, if he
wishes, keeps it.”
Mālik spoke about an investor who extended a man qirāḍ money
and the man told him that it had gathered up with him and asked
him to write it for him as a loan. He said, “I do not like that unless
he takes his money from him and then lends it to him or keeps it as
he wishes. at is only out of fear that he has lost some of it and
wants to defer it so that he can make up what has been lost of it.
at is disapproved of and is not permitted and it is not good.”

32.14 Accounting in qirāḍ
15 Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about an investor extending qirāḍ

money to an agent who made a proﬁt and then wanted to take his
share of the proﬁt and the investor was away. He said, “He should
not take any of it unless the investor is present. If he takes
something from it, he is responsible for it until it is accounted for in
the division of the capital.”
Mālik said, “It is not permitted for the parties involved in a qirāḍ to
account and divide property which is away from them until the
capital is present and the investor is repaid the principal in full.
en they divide the proﬁt into their agreed portions.”
Mālik spoke about a man taking qirāḍ money and buying goods
with it while he had a debt. en his creditors sought and found
him while he was in a city away from the investor and was in
possession of proﬁtable merchandise whose good quality was clear.
ey wanted him to sell the merchandise for them so that they
could take his share of the proﬁt. Mālik said, “None of the proﬁt of
the qirāḍ is taken until the investor is present. He takes his principal
and then the proﬁt is divided mutually between them.”
Mālik spoke about an investor who put qirāḍ money with an agent
and he used it and had a proﬁt. en the principal was set aside and
the proﬁt divided. He took his share and added the share of the
516

investor to his principal in the presence of witnesses he had called.
Mālik said, “It is not permitted to divide the proﬁt unless the
investor is present. If he has taken something he returns it until the
investor has received the principal in full. en what remains is
divided into their respective portions.”
Mālik spoke about an investor who put qirāḍ money with an agent.
e agent used it and then came to the investor and said, “is is
your portion of the proﬁt, and I have taken the like of it for myself
and I have retained your principal in full.” Mālik said, “I do not like
that unless all the capital is present, the principal is there, and he
knows that it is complete and he receives it. en they divide the
proﬁt between them. He returns the principal to him if he wishes,
or he keeps it. e presence of the principal is necessary, out of fear
that the agent might have lost some of it and so may want it not to
be removed from him and to keep it in his hand.”

32.15 A general view of qirāḍ
16 Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about an investor who put qirāḍ

money with an agent who bought goods with it and the investor
told him to sell them. e agent said that he did not see any way of
selling them at that time and they quarrelled about it. He said, “One
does not pay any attention to what either of them say. e people of
experience and insight concerning such goods are asked about these
goods. If they can see any way of selling them, they are sold for
them. If they think that it is time to wait, then they should wait.”
Mālik spoke about a man who took qirāḍ money from an investor
and used it and, when the investor asked him for his money, he said
that he had it in full. When he held him to his settlement, he
admitted, “I have lost such-and-such,” and named a certain amount
of money. He further said, “I only told you that so that you would
leave it with me.” Mālik said, “He does not beneﬁt by denying it
after he had aﬃrmed that he had all of it. He is answerable by his
admission against himself unless he can produce evidence about the
loss of that property, which conﬁrms what he has said. If he does
517

not produce an acceptable reason, he is answerable by his admission
and his denial does not help him.”
Mālik said, “Similarly, had he said, ‘I have had such-and-such a
proﬁt from the capital,’ and then the owner of the capital asks him
to pay him the principal and his proﬁt, and then he says that he did
not have any proﬁt in it and had only said that so that it might be
left in his possession, that does not help him. He is taken to account
for what he aﬃrmed, unless he brings acceptable proof of what he
has said so that the ﬁrst statement is not binding on him.”
Mālik spoke about an investor who put qirāḍ money with an agent
who made a proﬁt with it. e agent said, “I took the qirāḍ from
you provided that I would have two-thirds.” e owner of the
capital says, “I gave you a qirāḍ on the condition that you took a
third.” Mālik said, “e statement taken is that of the agent, and he
must take an oath on that if what he says resembles the known
practice of qirāḍ or is close to it. If he brings a matter which is
unacceptable and people do not make qirāḍ like that, he is not
believed, and it is judged according to how a similar qirāḍ would
normally be.”
Mālik spoke about a man who gave a man one hundred dinars as a
qirāḍ. He bought goods with it and then went to pay the one
hundred dinars to the owner of the goods and found that they had
been stolen. e investor says, “Sell the goods. If there is anything
over, it is mine. If there is a loss, it is against you because you lost
it.” e agent says, “Rather you must fulﬁl what the seller is owed. I
bought them with your capital which you gave me.” Mālik said,
“e agent is obliged to pay the price to the seller and the investor is
told, ‘If you wish, pay the hundred dinars to the agent and the goods
are between you. e qirāḍ is according to what the ﬁrst hundred
was based on. If you wish, you are free of the goods.’ If the hundred
dinars are paid to the agent, it is a qirāḍ according to the conditions
of the qirāḍ. If he refuses, the goods belong to the agent and he
must pay their price.”
518

Mālik spoke about two people in a qirāḍ who settled up and the
agent still had some of the goods which he used – threadbare cloth
or a waterskin or something like that. Mālik said, “Any of that
which is insigniﬁcant is of no importance and belongs to the agent.
I have not heard anyone give a decision calling for the return of that.
Anything which has a price is returned. If it is something which has
value like an animal, camel, coarse cloth or suchlike which fetches a
price, I think that he should return what he has remaining of such
things unless the owner overlooks it.”

519

33. Cropsharing
33.1 Cropsharing
1 Yaḥyā said that Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to the Jews of

Khaybar on the day that Khaybar was conquered, “I conﬁrm you in
it as long as Allah, the Mighty, the Majestic, establishes you in it
provided that the fruits are divided between you and us.”
Sa‘īd continued, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to send ‘Abdullāh
ibn Rawāḥa to assess the division of the fruit crop between him and
them, and he would say, ‘If you wish, you can buy it back, and if you
wish, it is mine.’ ey would take it.”
2 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Sulaymān ibn Yasār
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to send ‘Abdullāh ibn Rawāḥa

to Khaybar to assess the division of the fruit crop between him and
the Jews of Khaybar.
e Jews collected pieces of their jewellery for ‘Abdullāh and told
him, “is is yours. Treat us lightly and do not be too exacting in
the division!”

‘Abdullāh ibn Rawāḥa said, “O tribe of Jews! By Allah, you are the
most hateful to me of Allah’s creation, but it does not prompt me to
deal unjustly with you. What you have oﬀered me as a bribe is
forbidden. We will not touch it.” ey said, “is is what supports
the heavens and the earth.”
Mālik said, “If a cropsharer waters the palms and between them
there is some uncultivated land, whatever he cultivates in the
uncultivated land is his.”
Mālik said, “If the owner of the land makes a condition that he will
cultivate the uncultivated land for himself, that is not good because
520

the cropsharer does the watering for the owner of the land and so he
increases the property of the landowner (without any return for
himself ).”
Mālik said, “If the owner stipulates that the fruit crop is to be
shared between them, there is no harm in that if all the maintenance
of the property – seeding, watering and care etc. – are the concern of
the cropsharer.
If the cropsharer stipulates that the seeds are the responsibility of
the owner of the property, that is not permitted, because he has
stipulated an outlay against the owner of the property. Cropsharing
is contracted on the basis that all the care and expense is outlayed by
the cropsharer, and the owner of the property is not obliged to do
anything. is is the accepted method of cropsharing.”
Mālik spoke about a spring which was shared between two men,
and then the water dried up and one of them wanted to work on the
spring and the other said, “I do not have the means to work on it.”
He said, “Tell the one who wants to work on the spring, ‘Work and
expend. All the water will be yours. You will have its water until
your companion brings you half of what you have spent. If he brings
you half of what you have spent, he can take his share of the water.’
e ﬁrst one is given all the water because he has spent out on it
and, if he does not achieve anything by his work, the other has not
incurred any expense.”
Mālik said, “It is not good for a cropsharer to only expend his labour
and to be hired for a share of the fruit while all the expense and
work is incurred by the owner of the garden, because the cropsharer
does not know what the exact wage is going to be for his labour,
whether it will be little or great.”
Mālik said, “No one who lends a qirāḍ, or grants a cropsharing
contract, should except some of the wealth or some of the trees from
his agent, because by that the agent becomes his hired man. He
says, ‘I will grant you a cropshare provided that you work for me on
521

such-and-such a palm – water and tend it. I will give you a qirāḍ for
so-much money, provided that you work for me for ten dinars. ey
are not part of the qirāḍ which I have given you.’ at must not be
done. It is not good. is is how things are done in our community.”
Mālik said, “e sunna of what is permitted to an owner of a garden
in cropsharing is that he can stipulate to the cropsharer the
maintenance of walls, cleaning the spring, sweeping the irrigation
canals, pollinating the palms, pruning branches, harvesting the fruit
and such things, provided that the cropsharer has a share of the fruit
ﬁxed by mutual agreement. However, the owner cannot stipulate the
beginning of new work which the agent will start – digging a well,
raising the source of a well, instigating new planting, or building a
cistern whose cost is great. at is as if the owner of the garden were
to say to a certain man, ‘Build me a house here or dig me a well or
make a spring full for me or do some work for me for half the fruit
of this garden of mine’, before the garden is sound and it is lawful to
sell it. is is the sale of fruit before its good condition is clear. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade fruit to be sold before it was clear
that it was in good condition.”
Mālik continued, “If the fruits are good and their good condition is
clear and selling them is lawful, and then the owner asks a man to
do such a job for him, specifying the job, for half the fruit of his
garden, for example, there is no harm in that. He has hired the man
for something recognised and known. e man has seen it and it
satisﬁed with it.
“As for cropsharing, if the garden has no fruit or little or bad fruit,
he has only that. e labourer is only hired for a set amount, and
hire is only permitted on these terms. Hire is a type of sale. One
man buys another man’s work from him. It is not good if
uncertainty enters into it, because the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
forbade uncertain transactions.”
Mālik said, “e sunna in cropsharing with us is that it can be
practised with any kind of fruit tree, palm, vine, olive tree,
522

pomegranate, peach, and so on. It is permitted, and there is no
harm in it, provided that the owner of the property has a share of
the fruit: a half or a third or a quarter or whatever.”
Mālik said, “Cropsharing is also permitted in any crop which
emerges from the earth if it is a crop which is picked and its owner
cannot water, work on it and tend it.
“Cropsharing becomes reprehensible in the case of anything in
which cropsharing is normally permitted if the fruit is already sound
and its good condition is clear and it is lawful to sell it. He must
cropshare in it the next year. If a man waters fruit whose condition
is clear and it is lawful to sell it, and he picks it for the owner for a
share of the crop – it is not cropsharing. It is similar to him being
paid in dirhams and dinars. Cropsharing is what is between pruning
the palms and when the fruit becomes sound and its sale is lawful.”
Mālik said, “If someone makes a cropsharing contract with fruit
trees before the condition becomes clear and its sale is lawful, it is
cropsharing and is permitted.”
Mālik said, “Uncultivated land must not be involved in a
cropsharing contract. at is because it is lawful for the owner to
rent it for dinars and dirhams or the equivalent for an accepted
price.”
Mālik said, “As for a man who gives his uncultivated earth for a
third or a fourth of what comes out of it, that is an uncertain
transaction because crops may be scant one time and plentiful
another time. It may perish completely and the owner of the land
will have abandoned a set rent which would have been good for him
to rent the land for. He takes an uncertain situation and does not
know whether or not it will be satisfactory. is is disapproved. It is
like a man having someone travel for him for a set amount and then
saying, ‘Shall I give you a tenth of the proﬁt of the journey as your
wage?’ is is not lawful and must not be done.”

523

Mālik summed up, “A man must not hire out himself or his land or
his ship unless it is for set amount.”
Mālik said, “A distinction is made between cropsharing in palms
and in cultivated land because the owner of the palms cannot sell
the fruit until its good condition is clear. e owner of the land can
rent it when it is uncultivated with nothing on it.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community about palms is that
they can also be cropshared for three and four years, and less or
more than that.”
Mālik said, “at is what I have heard. Any fruit trees like that are
in the position of palms. Contracts for several years are permissible
for the cropsharer as they are permissible in the palms.”
Mālik said about the owner, “He does not take anything additional
from the cropsharer in the way of gold or silver or crops which
increase. at is not good. e cropsharer also must not take from
the owner of the garden anything additional which will increase him
in gold, silver, crops or anything. Increase beyond what is stipulated
in the contract is not good. It is also not good for the lender of a
qirāḍ to be in this position. If such an increase does enter
cropsharing or qirāḍ, it becomes by it hire. It is not good when hire
is involved. Hire must never occur in a situation which has
uncertainty in it.”
Mālik spoke about a man who gave land to another man in a
cropsharing contract on some of which there were palms, vines, or
other such fruit trees growing, and some of which was uncultivated.
He said, “If the uncultivated land is secondary to the fruit trees,
either in importance or in size of land, there is no harm in
cropsharing. at is if the palms take up two-thirds of the land or
more and the uncultivated land is a third or less. is is because
when the land given over to fruit trees is secondary to the
uncultivated land and the cultivated land in which the palms, vines,
or the like is a third or less, and the uncultivated land is two-thirds
524

or more, it is permitted to rent out that land and cropsharing in it is
unlawful.
“One of the common practices of people is to enter into cropsharing
contracts on property with fruit trees which has uncultivated land
attached to it, and to rent land which has fruit trees on it, just as a
Qur’ān or a sword which has some silver embellishment on it is sold
for silver, or a necklace or ring which have stones and gold in them
are sold for dinars. ese sales continue to be permitted. People buy
and sell by them. No speciﬁc has been described or instituted about
such things which, if exceeded, makes them unlawful, and, if fallen
below makes them lawful. What is done in our community about
them is what people have always practised and permitted among
themselves. at is, if the gold or silver is secondary to what it is
incorporated in, it is permitted to sell it. For instance, if the value of
the blade, the Qur’ān, or the stones is two-thirds or more, and the
value of the decoration is one-third or less.”

33.2 e condition about slaves in cropsharing
3 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e best of what has been heard

about a cropsharer stipulating on the owner of the property the
inclusion of some slave workers is that there is no harm in it if they
are workers that are attached to the property. ey are like the
property. ere is no proﬁt in them for the cropsharer except to
lighten some of his burden. If they did not come with the property,
his toil would be harder. It is like cropsharing land with a spring or a
watering-trough. You will not ﬁnd anyone who receives the same
share for cropsharing two lands which are equal in property and
yield, when one property has a constant plentiful spring and the
other has a watering-trough, because of the ease of working land
with a spring and the hardship of working land with a wateringtrough.”
Mālik added, “is is what is done in our community.”

525

Mālik said, “A cropsharer cannot employ workers from the property
in other work, and he cannot make a stipulation with the contract
holder. Nor is it permitted for the cropsharer to stipulate on the
owner of the property inclusion of slaves for use in the garden who
are not attached to it when he makes the cropsharing contract.
“Nor must the owner of the property stipulate to the cropsharer that
the owner can take any particular slave attached to the property and
remove him from the property. e cropsharing of property is based
on the state which it is currently in.
“If the owner of the property wants to remove one of the slaves of
the property, he removes him before the cropsharing, or if he wants
to put someone into the property he does it before the cropsharing.
en he grants the cropsharing contract after that if he wishes. If
any of the slaves die or go oﬀ or become ill, the owner of the
property must replace them.”

526

34. Renting Land
34.1 Renting land
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān

from Ḥanẓala ibn Qays az-Zuraqī from Rāﬁ‘ ibn Khadīj that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade renting out ﬁelds.

Ḥanẓala said, “I asked Rāﬁ‘ ibn Khadīj about paying rent in gold
and silver and he said, ‘ere is no harm in it’.”
2 Mālik related to me that Ibn Shihāb said, “I asked Sa‘īd ibn al-

Musayyab about renting land for gold or silver and he said, ‘ere is
no harm in it.’”
3 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb that he asked Sālim ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar about renting out ﬁelds. He said, “ere is no
harm if it is done with gold or silver.” Ibn Shihāb said, “I said to
him, ‘What do you think of the ḥadīth which is mentioned from
Rāﬁ‘ ibn Khadīj?’ He replied, ‘Rāﬁ‘ has exaggerated. If I had a ﬁeld,
I would rent it out.’”
4 Mālik related to me that he had heard that ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn

‘Awf rented some land which he remained on until he died. His son
said, “I thought that it belonged to us, because of the length of time
which it had been in his hands, until he mentioned it to us at his
death. He ordered us to pay some rent which he owed in gold or
silver.”
5 Mālik related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his father used

to rent out his land for gold and silver.

Mālik was asked about a man who rented out his ﬁeld for one
hundred ṣā‘s of dates or part of its produce of wheat or from
produce from another source. He disapproved of that.

527

35. Pre-emption in Property
35.1 Cases in which pre-emption is possible
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab and from Abū Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬allocated partners the right of preemption in property which had not been divided up. When
boundaries had been ﬁxed between them, then there was no right of
pre-emption.
Mālik said, “at is the sunna about which there is no dispute
among us.”
2 Mālik said that he had heard that Sa‘īd al-Musayyab, when asked

about pre-emption and whether there was any sunna about it, said,
“Yes. Pre-emption applies to houses and land, and it only applies
between shareholders.”
3 Mālik related to me that he heard the like of that from Sulaymān

ibn Yasār.

Mālik spoke about a man bringing one of his partners in a shared
property by paying the man with an animal, a slave, a slave-girl or
some such equivalent in goods. en later on another of the partners
decides to exercise his right of pre-emption, and he ﬁnds that the
slave or slave-girl has died and no one knows what her value had
been. e buyer claims that the value of the slave-girl was a hundred
dinars while the partner with the right of pre-emption claims that
her value was only ﬁfty dinars.
Mālik said, “e buyer takes an oath that the value of his payment
was a hundred dinars. en, if the one with the right of preemption wishes, he can compensate him or else he can leave it,
unless he can bring clear proof that the slave or slave-girl’s value was
less than what the buyer has said. If someone gives away his portion
528

of a shared house or land and the recipient repays him for it with
cash or goods, the partners can take it by pre-emption if they wish
and pay oﬀ the recipient the value of what he gave in dinars or
dirhams. If someone makes a gift of his portion of a shared house or
land and does not take any remuneration and does not seek to do so,
and a partner wants to take it for its value, he cannot do so as long
as the original partner has not been given recompense for it. If there
is any recompense, the one with the right of pre-emption can have it
for the price of the recompense.”
Mālik spoke about a man who bought into a piece of shared land for
a price on credit and one of the partners wanted to possess it by
right of pre-emption. Mālik said, “If it seems likely that the partner
can meet the terms, he has the right of pre-emption for the same
credit terms. If it is feared that he will not be able to meet the terms,
but he can bring a wealthy and reliable guarantor of equal standing
to the person who bought the land, he can also take possession.”
Mālik said, “A person’s absence does not sever his right of preemption. Even if he is away for a long time, there is no time limit
after which the right of pre-emption is cut oﬀ.”
Mālik said that if a man left land to a number of his children, then
one of them who had a child died, and the child of the deceased
sold his right in that land, the brother of the seller was more entitled
to pre-empt him than his paternal uncles, the father’s partners.”
Mālik said, “is is what is done in our community.”
Mālik said, “Pre-emption is shared between partners according to
their existing shares. Each of them takes according to his portion –
if it is small, he has little, if it is great, it is according to that. at is
if they are obstinate and contend with each other about it.”
Mālik said, “In the situation where a man buys out the share of one
of his partners, and then one of the other partners says, ‘I will take a
portion according to my share,’ and the ﬁrst partner says, ‘If you
529

wish to take all the pre-emption, I will give it up to you. If you wish
to leave it, then leave it,’ then if the ﬁrst partner gives him the
choice and hands it over to him, the second partner can only take all
the pre-emption or give it back. If he takes it, he is entitled to it. If
not, he has nothing.”
Mālik spoke about a man who bought land and developed it by
planting trees or digging a well etc. and then someone came and,
seeing that he had a right in the land, wanted to take possession of
it by pre-emption. Mālik said, “He has no right of pre-emption
unless he compensates the other for his expenditure. If he gives him
a price which covers what he has developed, he is entitled to preemption. If not, he has no right to it.”
Mālik said that someone who sold oﬀ his portion of a shared house
or land and then, on learning that someone with a right of preemption was to take possession by that right, asked the buyer to
revoke the sale, and he did so, did not have the right to do that. e
pre-emptor has more right to the property for the price for which he
sold it.
Referring to the case of someone buying an animal and goods (that
are not shared property) along with a section of a shared house or
land so that when anyone demands his right of pre-emption in the
house or the land, he says, “Take what I have bought altogether, for
I bought it together,” Mālik said, “e pre-emptor need only take
possession of the house or land. Each thing the man bought is
assessed according to its share of the lump sum the man paid. en
the pre-emptor takes possession of his right for a price which is
appropriate on that basis. He does not take any animals or goods
unless he wants to do so.”
Mālik said, “If someone sells a section of shared land and one of
those who have the right of pre-emption surrenders it to the buyer
and another insists on taking his pre-emption, the one who refuses
to surrender has to take up all the pre-emption and he cannot take
according to his right and leave what remains.”
530

Mālik said, “In the case where one of a number of partners in a
single house sells his share, when all his partners are away except for
one man, and the one present, when given the choice of either
taking the pre-emption or leaving it, declares, ‘I will take my
portion and leave the portions of my partners until they are present.
If they take it, that is that. If they leave it, I will take all the preemption.’” Mālik said, “He can only take it all or leave it. If his
partners come, they can take their portion from him or leave it as
they wish. If this is oﬀered to him and he does not accept it, I think
that he has no pre-emption.”

35.2 Cases in which pre-emption is not possible
4 Yaḥyā said that Mālik related from Muḥammad ibn ‘Umāra from

Abū Bakr ibn Ḥazm than ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān said, “ere is no preemption in land in which boundaries have been ﬁxed. ere is no
pre-emption in a well or in male palm-trees.”
Mālik said, “is is what is done in our community.”

Mālik said, “ere is no pre-emption in a road, whether or not it is
practicable to divide it.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that there is no preemption in the courtyard of a house, whether or not it is practicable
to divide it.”
Mālik spoke about a man who bought into a shared property,
provided that he had the option of withdrawal, and the partners of
the seller wanted to take what their partner was selling by preemption before the buyer had exercised his option. Mālik said,
“ey cannot do that until the buyer has taken possession and the
sale is conﬁrmed for him. When the sale is conﬁrmed, they have the
right of pre-emption.”
Mālik spoke about a man who bought some land which remained in
his possession for some time. en a man came and saw that he had
a share of the land by inheritance. Mālik said, “If the man’s right of
531

inheritance is established, he also has a right of pre-emption. If the
land has produced a crop, the crop belongs to the buyer until the day
when the right of the other is established, because he has tended
what was planted against being destroyed or being carried away by a
ﬂood.”
Mālik continued, “If it has been a very long time, or the witnesses
are dead, or the seller has died, or they are both alive but the basis of
the sale and purchase has been forgotten because of the length of
time, pre-emption is discontinued. A man only takes his right by
inheritance which has been established for him.
“If his situation is not like this because the sale transaction is a
recent one and he sees that the seller has concealed the price in
order to sever his right of pre-emption, the value of the land is
estimated, and then he buys the land for that price by his right of
pre-emption. en the buildings, plants or structures which are
extra to the land are looked at so that he is in the position of the
person who has bought the land for a known price and then after
that has built on it and planted. e holder of the pre-emption takes
possession after this is concluded.”
Mālik said, “Pre-emption applies to the property of the deceased as
it does to the property of the living. If the family of the deceased
fear to break up the property of the deceased, then they share in it
and sell it, and they have no right of pre-emption over it.”
Mālik said, “ere is no pre-emption among us in the case of a slave
or slave-girl, or a camel, any animal, nor in clothes, nor a well which
does not have any uncultivated land around it. Pre-emption pertains
to what can be usefully divided and to land in which boundaries
occur. As for what cannot be usefully divided, there is no preemption in it.”
Mālik said, “Someone who buys land, in which people at hand have
a right of pre-emption, refers them to the Sultan and either they
claim their right or the ruler surrenders it to him. However, if he
532

were to leave them and not refer their situation to the ruler, whilst
they knew about his purchase but leave it a long time before coming
to demand their pre-emption, I do not think that they should have
it.”

533

36. Judgements
36.1 Stimulation of desire to judge correctly
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his

father from Zaynab bint Abī Salama from Umm Salama, the wife
of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I am but a
man to whom you bring your disputes. Perhaps one of you is more
eloquent in his proof than the other and so I give judgement
according to what I have heard from him. He must not take take
any of whatever I decide for him that is part of the right of his
brother, for I am granting him a portion of the Fire.”
2 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd ibn al-

Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb had a dispute brought to him
between a Muslim and a Jew. ‘Umar thought that the Jew was in the
right and gave judgement in his favour. e Jew said to him, “By
Allah! You have judged correctly!” So ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb struck
him with his whip and said, “How can you be sure?” e Jew said to
him, “We ﬁnd that there is no judge who judges correctly but that
there is an angel on his right side and an angel on his left side who
guide him and give him success in the truth as long as he is with the
truth. When he leaves the truth, they rise and leave him.”

36.2 Giving testimony
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm from his father from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Amr ibn ‘Uthmān from Abū ‘Amra al-Anṣārī from Zayd ibn Khālid
al-Juhanī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Shall I not tell you
who is the best of witnesses? e one who brings his testimony
before he is asked for it or tells his testimony before he is asked for
it.”

534

4 Mālik related to me that Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān said, “An

Iraqi man came before ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and said, ‘I have come
to you because of a matter which has no beginning and no end.’
‘Umar asked him, ‘What is it?’ e man said, ‘False testimony has
appeared in our land.’ ‘Umar inquired, ‘Is that so?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’
‘Umar said, ‘By Allah! A man is not detained in Islam without just
witnesses.’”
Mālik related to me that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “e testimony
of a litigant or a man who is suspect is not accepted.”

36.3 Judgement on testimony of those who have received ḥaddpunishments
Yaḥyā said from Mālik that he heard from Sulaymān ibn Yasar and
others that when they were asked whether the testimony of a man
who had been ﬂogged for a ḥadd crime was allowed, they replied,
“Yes, when he shows repentance.”
Mālik related to me that he heard Ibn Shihāb being asked about
that and he said something similar to what Sulaymān ibn Yasār said.
Mālik said, “at is what is done in our community. It is by the
word of Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, ‘But those who make
accusations against chaste women and then do not produce four
witnesses: ﬂog them with eighty lashes and never again accept them
as witnesses. Such people are the degenerate – except for those who
after that repent and put things right. Allah is Ever-Forgiving, Most
Merciful.’” (24:4).

36.4 Judgement based on oaths along with the testimony of a
single witness

535

5 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said from Ja‘far ibn Muḥammad from his
father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬pronounced judgement on the

basis of an oath along with a single witness.

6 From Mālik from Abū az-Zinād that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz

wrote to ‘Abd al-Ḥamīd ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Zayd ibn alKhaṭṭāb who was the governor of Kufa, “Pronounce judgement on
the basis of an oath along with one witness.”
7 Mālik related to me that he heard that Abū Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān and Sulaymān ibn Yasār were both asked, “Does one
pronounce judgement on the basis of an oath along with a single
witness?” ey both replied, “Yes.”
Mālik said, “e precedent of the sunna in judging by an oath along
with a single witness is that, if the plaintiﬀ takes an oath along with
presenting his witness, he is conﬁrmed in his right. If he draws back
and refuses to take an oath, the defendant is made to take an oath.
If he takes an oath, the claim against him is dropped. If he refuses
to take an oath, the claim is conﬁrmed against him.”
Mālik said, “is procedure pertains to property cases in particular.
It does not occur in any of the ḥadd punishments, nor in marriage,
divorce, freeing slaves, theft or slander. If someone says, ‘Freeing
slaves comes under property,’ he has erred. It is not as he says. Had
it been as he says a slave could take an oath along with one witness,
if he could ﬁnd one, that his master had freed him.
“However, when a slave lays claim to a piece of property, he can take
an oath along with presenting one witness and demand his right as
the freeman demands his right.”
Mālik said, “e sunna with us is that when a slave brings
somebody who witnesses that he has been set free, his master is
made to take an oath that he has not freed him, and the slave’s claim
is cancelled.”

536

Mālik said, “e sunna about divorce is also like that with us. When
a woman brings somebody who testiﬁes that her husband has
divorced her, the husband is made to take an oath that he has not
divorced her. If he takes the oath, the divorce does not proceed.”
Mālik said, “e sunna in cases of divorce and freeing a slave is one
witness. e right to make an oath only belongs to the husband of
the woman and the master of the slave. Freeing is a ḥadd matter,
and the testimony of women is not permitted in it because, when a
slave is set free, his inviolability is aﬃrmed and the ḥadd
punishments are applied for and against him. If he commits
fornication and is muḥṣan, he is stoned for it. If he kills a slave, he is
killed for it. Inheritance is established for him, between him and
whoever inherits from him. If somebody disputes this, arguing that
if a man frees his slave and then a man comes to demand from the
master of the slave payment of the debt, and a man and two women
testify to his right, that establishes the right against the master of
the slave, so that his freeing of the slave is cancelled if the slave is
his only property – inferring by this case that the testimony of
women is permitted in cases of setting-free – the case is not as he
suggests (i.e. it is a case of property, not freeing). It is rather like a
man who frees his slave, and then the claimant of a debt comes to
the man and takes an oath along with one witness, demanding his
right. By this, the emancipation of a slave would be cancelled. Or
else a man is brought who has frequent dealings and transactions
with the master of the slave and he is asked to take an oath that he
doesn’t owe what the claimant claims. If he draws back and refuses
to take an oath, the claimant takes an oath and his right against the
master of the slave is conﬁrmed. is would cancel the freeing of
the slave, if it is conﬁrmed that property is owed by the master.”
Mālik said, “It is the same with a man who marries a slave-girl and
then the master of the slave-girl comes to the man who has married
her and claims, ‘You and so-and-so have bought my slave-girl from
me for such an amount of dinars.’ e slave-girl’s husband denies
that. e master of the slave-girl brings a man and two women and
537

they testify to what he has said. e sale is conﬁrmed and his claim
is considered to be true. So the slave-girl is unlawful for her
husband and they have to separate even though the testimony of
women is not accepted in divorce.”
Mālik said, “It is also the same when a man accuses a supposedly
free man of a ḥadd crime and then a man and two women come and
testify that the accused is in fact a slave. at would remove the
ḥadd from the accused after it has been proved against him, even
though the testimony of women is not accepted in accusations
involving ḥadd punishments.”
Mālik said, “Another similar case in which judgement appears to go
against the precedent of the sunna is when two women testify that a
child was born alive. is would eﬀect inheritance if a situation
arose where he was entitled to inherit, and the child’s property
would go to those who inherited from him if he dies, and it is not
necessary that the two women witnesses should be accompanied by
a man or an oath, even though it may involve vast possessions of
gold, silver, livestock, gardens and slaves and other properties.
However, had two women testiﬁed to one dirham or more or less
than that in a property case, their testimony would not aﬀect
anything and would not be permitted unless they came with a
witness or took an oath.”
Mālik said, “ere are people who say that an oath is not acceptable
with only one witness and they argue by the word of Allah, the
Blessed, the Exalted whose word is the Truth, ‘Two men among you
should act as witnesses. But if there are not two men, then a man
and two women with whom you are satisﬁed as witnesses.’ (2:282)
Such people argue that if he does not bring one man and two
women, he has no claim and he is not allowed to swear an oath with
one witness.”
Mālik said, “Part of the proof against those who argue in this way is
to reply to them, ‘Do you think that if a man claims property from
another man, the one from whom he claims it should not swear that
538

the claim is false?’ If he swears, the claim against him is dropped. If
he refuses to swear an oath, the claimant is made to swear an oath
that his claim is true and his right against his companion is
established. ere is no dispute about this with any of the people
nor in any country. By what does the doubter take this? In what
place in the Book of Allah does he ﬁnd it? So if he conﬁrms this, let
him conﬁrm the oath with one witness, even if it is not in the Book
of Allah, the Mighty, the Majestic. It is enough that this is the
precedent of the sunna. However, man wants to recognise the
proper course of action and the location of the proof. In this there is
a clariﬁcation for what is obscure about that, if Allah wills.”

36.5 Judgement on a deceased with a debt against him and a debt
for him and only one witness
Yaḥyā said that Mālik spoke about a man who died with a debt
owed to him that there was only a single witness for, and some
people had a debt against him and they also had only a single
witness. e heirs refused to take an oath about their rights and to
present their witness. He said, “e creditors take an oath and take
their rights. If there is anything left over, the heirs do not take any
of it, because the oaths were oﬀered to them before and they
abandoned them, unless they say, ‘We did not know that our
companion had extra,’ and it is known that they only abandoned the
oaths because of that. I think that they should take an oath and take
what remains after the debt is paid oﬀ.”

36.6 Judgement on claims
8 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said that Jamīl ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmān al-

Mu’adhdhin was present when ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz was judging
between people. If a man came to him with a claim against
someone, he examined whether or not there were frequent
transactions and dealings between them. If there were, the
defendant could make an oath. If there was nothing of that nature
he did not accept an oath from him.”
539

Mālik summed up, “What is done in our community is that if
someone makes a claim against a man, it is examined. If there are
frequent transactions and dealings between them, the defendant is
made to swear on oath. If he swears on oath, the claim against him
is dropped. If the defendant refuses to swear on oath, and foregoes
the oath to the claimant, the one claiming his right swears an oath
and takes his due.”

36.7 Judgement on the testimony of children
9 Yaḥyā said that Mālik said from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that ‘Abdullāh

ibn az-Zubayr gave judgement based on the testimony of children
concerning the injuries which occurred between them.
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our
community is that the testimony of children is permitted concerning
injuries between themselves. It is not accepted in anything else. It is
only permitted between them if they make their testimony before
they leave the scene of the incident or have been deceived or
instructed. If they leave the scene, they have no testimony unless
they call reputable witnesses to support their testimony about what
happened before they left.”

36.8 Perjury on the minbar of the Prophet
10 Yaḥyā said that Mālik related to me from Hishām ibn Hishām

ibn ‘Utba ibn Abī Waqqāṣ from ‘Abdullāh ibn Nistās from Jābir ibn
‘Abdullāh al-Anṣārī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If
someone swears a false oath near this minbar of mine, he will take
his seat in the Fire.”
11 Mālik related to me from al-‘Alā’ ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān from

Ma‘bad ibn Ka‘b as-Salamī from his brother, ‘Abdullāh ibn Ka‘b ibn
Mālik al-Anṣārī, from Abū Umāma that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, “If someone takes the right of a Muslim man by his oath,
Allah will forbid him the Garden and make the Fire mandatory for
him.” ey said, “Even if is something insigniﬁcant, Messenger of
540

Allah?” He replied, “Even if it is a toothpick, even if it is a tooth
pick,” repeating that three times.

36.9 Taking oaths on the minbar in general
12 Yaḥyā said that Mālik had said from Dā’ūd ibn al-Ḥusayn that he

heard Abū Ghaṭafān ibn Ṭarīf al-Murrī say, “Zayd ibn ābit alAnṣārī and Ibn Mutī‘ had a dispute about a house which they
shared. ey went to Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam who was the governor
of Madīna. Marwān decided that Zayd ibn ābit must take an
oath on the minbar. Zayd ibn ābit said, ‘I will swear to it where I
am.’ Marwān said, ‘No, by Allah! Only in the place of sorting out
claims (i.e. the minbar).’ Zayd ibn ābit began to swear on oath
that his right was true, and he refused to take an oath near the
minbar. Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam was surprised at that.”
Mālik said, “I do not think anyone should be made to take an oath
near the minbar for less than a fourth of a dinar, and that is three
dirhams.”

36.10 Prohibition against forfeiting pledges given on security
13 Yaḥyā said that Mālik related to him from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd
ibn al-Musayyab that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e pledge

given as security is not forfeited.”

Mālik said, “e explanation of that according to what we think –
and Allah knows best – is that a man gives a pledge to somebody in
security for something and the pledge is superior to what it is
pawned for. e pledger says to the pawnbroker, ‘I will bring you
your due after such-and-such a time. If not, the pledge is yours for
what it was pawned for.’”
Mālik said, “is transaction is not good and it is not lawful, and
this is what was forbidden. If the owner brings what he pledged it
for after the period has lapsed, the pledge is his. I think that the
time condition is void.”

36.11 Judgement on pledging fruit and animals as security
Yaḥyā said, “I heard Mālik say that if a man pledges his garden for a
stated period and the fruits of that garden are ready before the end
of the period, the fruits are not included in the pledge with the real
estate, unless it is stipulated by the pledger when making the pledge.
However, if a man receives a slave-girl as a pledge, and she is
pregnant or she becomes pregnant after his taking her as a pledge,
her child is included with her.
“A distinction is made between the fruit and the child of the slavegirl. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘If someone sells a palm which
has been pollinated, the fruit belongs to the seller unless the buyer
stipulates its inclusion.’ e undisputed way of doing things in our
community is that when a man sells a slave-girl or an animal with a
foetus in its womb, the foetus belongs to the buyer, whether or not
the buyer makes it a stipulation. e palm is not like the animal.
Fruit is not like the foetus in the mother’s womb. Another thing
that also makes this clear is that it is the custom of people to let a
man pawn the fruit of the palm apart from the palm. No one pawns
the foetus in its mother’s womb, however, whether of slaves or
animals.”

36.12 Judgement on pledging animals as security
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e undisputed way of doing
things in our community, concerning pledges is that in cases where
land or a house or an animal are known to have been destroyed
whilst in the possession of the pledge-holder, and the circumstances
of the loss are known, the loss is against the pledger. ere is no
deduction made from what is due to the pledge-owner at all. Any
pledge which perishes in the possession of the pledge-owner, and
the circumstances of its loss are only known by his word, the loss is
against the pledge-owner and he is liable for its value. He is asked to
describe whatever was destroyed and then he is made to take an oath
about his description and what he loaned on security for it.
542

“en people of discernment evaluate the description. If the pledge
was worth more than what the pledge-holder loaned, the pledger
takes the extra. If the assessed value of the pledge is less than what
he was loaned, the pledger is made to take an oath as to what the
pledge-holder loaned and he does not have to pay the extra which
the pledge-holder loaned above the assessed value of the pledge. If
the pledge-holder says that he does not know the value of the
pledge, the pledger is made to take an oath on the description of the
pledge and it is his if he brings a matter which is not disapproved
of.”
Mālik said, “All this applies when the pledge-holder takes
possession of the pledge and does not put it in the hands of
another.”

36.13 Judgement on pledges shared between two men
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik speak about two men who shared in
making a pledge. One of them undertakes to sell his share of the
pledge and the other one asks him to wait a year for his due. He
said, “If it is possible to divide the pledge, and the due of the one
who asked him to wait will not be decreased, half the pledge which
is between them is sold for him and he is given his due. If it is
feared that his right will be decreased, all the pledge is sold, and the
one who undertook to sell his pledge is given his due from that. If
the one who asked him to wait for his due is pleased in himself, half
of the price is paid to the pledger. If not, the pledgee is made to take
an oath that he only asked him wait so that he could ‘transfer my
pledge to me in its form’. en he is given his due immediately.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say about a slave, whose master had
pledged him and the slave had property of his own, “e property of
the slave is not part of the pledge unless the pledge-broker makes it
a stipulation.”

36.14 Judgement on pledges in general

543

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik speak about someone who pledges
goods as security for a loan, and they perish with the broker. e
one who took out the loan conﬁrms its speciﬁcation. ey agree on
the amount of the loan, but challenge each other about the value of
the pledge, the pledger saying that it was worth twenty dinars whilst
the broker says that it was only worth ten, and that the amount
loaned on security was twenty dinars. Mālik said, “e pledger is
asked to describe it. If he describes it he is made to take an oath on
it and then people of experience evaluate what he describes. If its
value is more than what was loaned on security for it, it is said to the
broker, ‘Return the rest of his due to the pledger.’ If the value is less
than what was loaned on security for it, the broker takes the rest of
his due from the pledger. If the value is the exact amount of the
loan, the pledge is compensated for by the loan.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community about two men who have a dispute about an amount of
money loaned on the security of a pledge – the pledger claiming
that he pledged it for ten dinars and the broker insisting that he
took the pledge as security for twenty dinars, and the pledge is
clearly in the possession of the broker – is that the broker is made to
take an oath when the value of the pledge is fully known. If the
value of the pledge is exactly what he swore that he had loaned on
security for it, the broker takes the pledge as his right. He is more
entitled to take precedence in swearing the oath since he has
possession of the pledge. If the owner of the pledge wants to give
him the amount which he swears that he is owed, he can take the
pledge back. If the pledge is worth less than the twenty dinars he
loaned, then it is said to the pledger, ‘Either you give him what he
has sworn to and take your pledge back, or you swear to what you
say you pledged for.’ If the pledger takes the oath, then what the
broker has increased over the value of the pledge will become
invalid. If the pledger does not swear on oath, he must pay what the
broker has sworn to.”

544

Mālik said, “If a pledge given on security for a loan perishes, and
both parties deny each other’s rights, with, for instance, the broker
who is owed the loan saying that he gave twenty dinars, and the
pledger who owes the loan saying that he was given only ten, and
with the broker who is owed the loan saying that the pledge was
worth ten dinars, and the pledger who owes the loan saying that it
was worth twenty, then the broker who is owed the loan is asked to
describe the pledge. If he describes it, he must take an oath on its
description. en people with experience of such matters evaluate
the descripton. If the value of the pledge is estimated to be more
than what the broker claims it was, he takes an oath as to what he
claimed, and the pledger is given what is over from the value of the
pledge. If its value is less than what the broker claims about it, he is
made to take an oath as to what he claims is his. en he demands
settlement according to the actual value of the pledge. e one who
owes the loan is then made to take an oath on the extra amount
which remains owing against him to the claimant after the price of
the pledge has been reached. is is because the broker becomes a
claimant against the pledger. If he takes an oath, the rest of what the
broker swore to of what he claimed above the value of the pledge is
invalidated. If he draws back, he is bound to pay what remains due
to the broker after the value of the pledge.”

36.15 Judgement on renting animals and going beyond speciﬁed
destinations
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done is our
community about a man who rents an animal for a journey to a
speciﬁed place and then he goes beyond that place and further, is
that the owner of the animal has a choice. If he wants to take extra
rent for his animal to cover the distance overstepped, he is given
that on top of the ﬁrst rent and the animal is returned. If the owner
of the animal wants to sell the animal from the place where the man
has overstepped, he has the price of the animal on top of the rent. If,
however, the hirer rented the animal to go and return, and then he
overstepped when he reached the city to which he had rented it to
545

go, the owner of the animal only has half the ﬁrst rent. at is
because half of the rent is going, and half of it is returning. If he
oversteps with the animal, only half of the ﬁrst rent is obliged for
him. Had the animal died when he reached the city to which it was
rented, the hirer would not be liable and the renter would only have
half the rent.”
Mālik said, “at is what is done with people who overstep and
dispute about what they took the animal for.”
Mālik said, “It is also like that with someone who takes qirāḍ money
from his companion. e owner of the property says to him, ‘Do
not buy such-and-such animals or such-and-such goods,’ naming
the ones which he excludes and disapproves of his money being
invested in. e one who takes the money then buys what he was
forbidden. By that, he intends to be liable for the money and take
the proﬁt of his companion. When he does that, the owner of the
money has an option. If he wants to enter with him in the goods
according to the original stipulations between them about the proﬁt,
he does so. If he likes, he has his capital guaranteed against the one
who took the capital and overstepped the mark.”
Mālik said, “It is also like that with a man with whom another man
invests some goods. e owner of the property orders him to buy
certain goods for him which he names. He diﬀers and exchanges the
goods for something other than what he was ordered to buy,
exceeding his orders. e owner of the goods has an option. If he
wants to take what has been bought with his property, he takes it. If
he wants the partner to be liable for his capital he has that.”

36.16 Judgement about raped women
14 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb that ‘Abd al-Malik ibn

Marwān gave a judgement that the rapist had to pay the raped
woman her bride-price.

546

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community about the man who rapes a woman, virgin or nonvirgin, if she is free, is that he must pay the bride-price of someone
like her. If she is a slave, he must pay what he has diminished of her
worth. e ḥadd punishment in such cases is applied to the rapist,
and there is no punishment applied to the raped woman. If the
rapist is a slave, that is against his master unless he wishes to
surrender him.”

36.17 Judgement on consuming other people’s animals
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community about someone who consumes an animal without the
permission of its owner is that he must pay its price on the day he
consumed it. He is not obliged to replace it with any kind of animal.
He must pay its price on the day it was consumed, and giving the
value is more equitable in compensation for animals and goods.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say about someone who consumes
some food without the permission of its owner, “He returns to the
owner a like weight of the same kind of food. Food is in the position
of gold and silver. Gold and silver are returned with gold and silver.
e animal is not in the position of gold in such cases. What
distinguishes between them is the sunna and the normative practice
which is in force.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “If a man is entrusted with some
wealth and then trades with it for himself and makes a proﬁt, the
proﬁt is his because he is responsible for the property until he
returns it to its owner.”

36.18 Judgement on the abandonment of Islam
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If someone changes his religion – then

strike oﬀ his head!”

547

e meaning of the statement of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬in our opinion –
and Allah knows best – is that the words, “If someone changes his
religion – then strike oﬀ his head!” refers to those who leave Islam
for something else – like heretics and suchlike, about whom that is
known. ey are killed without being called to repent because their
repentance is not recognised. ey were concealing their disbelief
and making their Islam public, so I do not think that one should call
such people to repent and one does not accept their word. As for the
person who leaves Islam for something else and divulges it, he is
called on to repent. If he does not turn in repentance, he is killed. If
there are people in that situation, I think that one should call them
to Islam and call on them to repent. If they repent, that is accepted
from them. If they do not repent, they are killed. at does not refer
as we see it, and Allah knows best, to those who convert from
Judaism to Christianity or from Christianity to Judaism, nor to
someone who changes his religion from any of the various forms of
religion except for Islam. Whoever leaves Islam for something else
and makes that known, that is the one who is referred to, and Allah
knows best!”
16 Mālik related to me from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Muḥammad ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abd al-Qārī that his father said, “A man came to
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb from Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī. ‘Umar asked after
various people, and he informed him about them. en ‘Umar
inquired, ‘Do you have any recent news from those far away?’ He
said, ‘Yes. A man has become an unbeliever after he was Muslim.’
‘Umar said, ‘What have you done with him?’ He replied, ‘We let
him approach and then struck oﬀ his head.’ ‘Umar said, ‘Did you
not imprison him for three days and feed him a loaf of bread every
day and call on him to repent that he might turn in repentance and
return to the command of Allah?’ en ‘Umar said, ‘O Allah! I was
not present and I did not order it and I am not pleased since it has
come to me!”

36.19 Judgement on men ﬁnding other men with their wives

548

17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Suhayl ibn Abī Ṣarḥ as-

Sammān from his father from Abū Hurayra that Sa‘īd ibn ‘Ubāda
said to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “What do you think if I ﬁnd a
man with my wife? Shall I grant him a respite until I bring four
witnesses?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬replied, “Yes.”
18 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd ibn al-

Musayyab that a Syrian man called Ibn Khaybarī found a man with
his wife and killed him or killed them both. Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī
Sufyān found it diﬃcult to make a decision and he wrote to Abū
Mūsā al-Ash‘arī to ask ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib and ‘Alī said to him, “Has
this thing occurred in my land? I adjure you, you must tell me.” Abū
Mūsā explained to him how Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān had written
him to ask ‘Alī about it. ‘Alī said, “I am Abū al-Ḥasan. If he does
not bring four witnesses, then let him be completely handed over (to
the relatives of the murdered man).”

36.20 Judgement on the abandoned child
19 Yaḥyā said that Mālik related from Ibn Shihāb that Sunayn Abī

Jamīla, a man from the Banū Sulaym, found an abandoned child in
the time of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb. Sunayn took him to ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb. He asked, “What made you take this person?” He
answered, “I found him lost, so I took him.” ‘Umar’s advisor said to
him, “Amīr al-Mu’minīn, he is a man who does good!” ‘Umar
inquired of him, “Is that so?” He replied, “Yes.” ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb said, “Go, he is free and you have his walā’ inheritance
rights and we will provide for him.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community about an abandoned child is that he is free and his walā’
inheritance rights belongs to the Muslims, and they inherit from
him and pay his blood-money.”

36.21 Judgement on attaching paternity to children

549

20 Yaḥyā said from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn azZubayr that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “‘Utba ibn Abī

Waqqāṣ disclosed to his brother, Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ, that he had
fathered of the son of the slave-girl of Zam‘a and made him promise
to look after him (after his death). In the Year of the Conquest, Sa‘d
took him and said, ‘He is the son of my brother. He made a
covenant with me about him.’ ‘Abd ibn Zam‘a stood up and said,
‘He is my brother and the son of my father’s slave-girl. He was born
on his bed.’ ey went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. Sa‘d said, ‘He
is my brother’s son. He made a covenant with me about him.’ ‘Abd
ibn Zam‘a said, ‘He is my brother and the son of my father’s slavegirl and was born on my father’s bed.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘He is yours, ‘Abd ibn Zam‘a.’ en the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘A child belongs to the household (where he was born) and the
adulterer has stones.’ en he told Sawda bint Zam‘a, ‘Veil yourself
from him,’ since he saw that he resembled ‘Utba ibn Abī Waqqāṣ.”
‘Ā’isha added, “He did not see her from then on until he met Allah,
the Mighty, the Majestic.”
21 Mālik related to me from Yazīd ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn al-Hādī from

Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm ibn al-Ḥārith at-Taymī from Sulaymān
ibn Yasār from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Umayya that a woman’s husband
died and she observed the ‘idda of four months and ten days. en
she married when she was free to marry. She stayed with her
husband for four and a half months and then gave birth to a fullydeveloped child. Her husband went to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and
mentioned that to him, so ‘Umar called some of the old women of
the Jāhiliyya and asked them about that. One of the women said, “I
will tell you what happened with this woman. When her husband
died, she was pregnant by him but then the blood ﬂowed from her
because of his death and the child became dry in her womb. When
her new husband had intercourse with her and the water reached the
child, the child moved in the womb and grew.” ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb believed her and separated them (until she had completed
her ‘idda). ‘Umar said, “Only good has reached me about you two,”
and he connected the child to the ﬁrst husband.
550

22 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sulaymān ibn

Yasār that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb used to attach the children of the
Jāhiliyya to whoever claimed them in Islam. Two men came and
each of them claimed a woman’s child. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
summoned a person who scrutinised features to look at them. e
scrutiniser said, “ey both share in him.” ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb hit
him with a whip. en he summmoned the woman and said, “Tell
me your tale.” She said, “It was this one (indicating one of the two
men) who used to come to me while I was with my people’s camels.
He did not leave me until both he and I thought that I was
pregnant. en he left me and blood ﬂowed from me and this other
one took his place. I do not know which of them is the father of the
child.” e scrutinser said, “Allah is greater.” ‘Umar said to the
child, “Go to whichever of them you wish.”
23 Mālik related to me that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb

or ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān gave a judgement about a slave woman who
misled a man about herself and said that she was free. He married
her and she bore children. It was decided that he should ransom his
children with their like of slaves.

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “To ransom them with their
price is more equitable in this case, Allah willing.”

36.22 Judgement on inheritance of attached children
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e way of doing things
generally agreed upon in our community in the case of a man who
dies and has sons and one of them claims, ‘My father acknowledged
that so-and-so was his son,’ is that the relationship is not established
by the testimony of one man, and the conﬁrmation of the one who
conﬁrmed it is only permitted as regards his own share in the
division of his father’s property. e one testiﬁed for is only given
his due from the share of the testiﬁer.”
Mālik said, “An example of this is that a man dies leaving two sons
and 600 dinars. Each of them takes 300 dinars. en one of them
551

testiﬁes that his deceased father acknowledged that so-and-so was
his son. e one who testiﬁed is obliged to give 100 dinars to the one
thus connected. is is half of the inheritance of the one thought to
be related had he indeed been related. If the other son also
acknowledges him, he takes the other 100 and so he has his full right
and his relationship is established. His position is similar to that of a
woman who acknowledges a debt against her father or her husband
which the other heirs deny. She must pay to the person whose debt
she acknowledges the amount according to her share of the full debt
if it had been established against all the heirs. If the woman inherits
an eighth, she pays the creditor an eighth of his debt. If a daughter
inherits a half, she pays the creditor half of his debt. Whichever
women acknowledge the debt pay it according to this.”
Mālik said, “If a man’s testimony is in agreement with what the
woman testiﬁed to, that so-and-so was owed a debt by his father,
the creditor is then made to take an oath with one witness and he is
given all his due. is is not the position with women because a
man’s testimony is allowed and the creditor must take an oath with
the testimony of one witness and take all his due. If he does not take
an oath, he only takes from the inheritance of the one who
acknowledged him according to his share of the debt, because he
acknowledged his right while the other heirs denied it. It is
permitted for him to acknowledge it.”

36.23 Judgement on women who are umm walad
24 Yaḥyā said that Mālik related from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar from his father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said,
“What is the matter with men who have intercourse with their
slave-girls and then dismiss them? No slave-girl comes to me whose
master admits that he has had intercourse with her but that I
connect the child to him whether or not he has practised coitus
interruptus or stopped having intercourse with her.”
25 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that Ṣaﬁyya bint Abī ‘Ubayd

informed him that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “What is the matter
552

with men who have intercourse with their slave-girls and then let
them go? No slave-girl comes to me whose master admits that he
has had intercourse with her but that I connect the child to him,
whether or not he has practised coitus interruptus or stopped having
intercourse with her.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community about an umm walad who commits a crime is that her
master is liable for what she has done up to her value. He does not
have to surrender her and he cannot be made to bear more than her
value for her crime.”

36.24 Judgement on bringing barren land into cultivation
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If anyone revives

barren land, it belongs to him, and the root unjustly planted has no
right.”
Mālik explained, “e unjust root is whatever is taken or planted
without right.”
27 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn ‘Abdullāh

from his father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “When someone
revives barren land, it belongs to him.”
Mālik said, “at is what is done in our community.”

36.25 Judgement on watering land
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm that he heard that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said about the ﬂood-channels of Mahzūr and
Mudhaynib (in Madīna), “Dam them systematically so that the
water is diverted into each property in turn up to ankle level,
starting upstream.”

553

29 Mālik related to me from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Excess water is not

withheld in order to prevent pasturage from growing.”

30 Mālik related to me from Abū’r-Rijal Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān from his mother, ‘Amra bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān, that she
informed him that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do not
withhold the surplus water of a well from people.”

36.26 Judgement on beneﬁting neighbours
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Amr ibn Yaḥyā al-Māzinī
from his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere is no

injury nor return of injury.”

32 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from al-A‘raj from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “No one should

prevent his neighbour from ﬁxing a wooden peg in his wall.” en
Abū Hurayra said, “Why do I see you turning away from it? By
Allah! I shall keep on at you about it.”

33 Mālik related to me from ‘Amr ibn Yaḥyā al-Māzinī from his

father that aḍ-Ḍahhāk ibn Khalīfa watered his irrigation ditch from
a large source of water. He wanted to have it pass through the land
of Muḥammad ibn Maslama and Muḥammad refused. Aḍ-Ḍahhāk
asked him, “Why do you prevent me? It will beneﬁt you. You can
drink from it ﬁrst and last and it will not harm you?” Muḥammad
refused, so aḍ-Ḍahhāk spoke to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb about it.
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb summoned Muḥammad ibn Maslama and
ordered him to clear the way. Muḥammad said, “No.” ‘Umar said,
“Why do you prevent your brother from what will beneﬁt him and
is also useful for you? You will take water from it ﬁrst and last and it
will not harm you.” Muḥammad said, “No, by Allah!” ‘Umar said,
“By Allah, he will pass it through, even if it is over your belly!”
‘Umar ordered him to allow its passage and aḍ-Ḍahhāk did so.

554

34 Mālik related to me from ‘Amr ibn Yaḥyā al-Māzinī that his

father said, “ere was a stream in my grandfather’s garden
belonging to ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf. ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf
wanted to transfer it to a corner of the garden nearer his land but
my grandfather prevented him. ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf spoke to
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb about it and he gave a judgement that ‘Abd
ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf should transfer it.”

36.27 Judgement on division of properties
35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī
said, “I heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘A house or land

that has been divided up in the Jāhiliyya is according to the division
of the Jāhiliyya. A house or land which has not been divided up
before the coming of Islam is divided according to Islam.’”
36 Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik speak about a man who died

leaving properties in ‘Āliya and Sāﬁla (outlying districts of Madīna).
He said, “Unirrigated, naturally watered land is not in the same
category as irrigated land unless the family is satisﬁed with that.
Unirrigated land is only in the same category as land with a spring
when it resembles it. When the properties are in the same land and
are close together, each individual property is evaluated and then
divided between the heirs. Dwellings and houses are treated in the
same way.”

36.28 Judgement on animals grazing on other people’s crops and
animals stolen from the herd
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ḥarām

ibn Sa‘d ibn Muḥayyiṣa that a female camel of al-Barā’ ibn ‘Āzib
entered a man’s garden and caused some damage. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave a judgement that the garden’s owners were responsible
for guarding it during the day and the owner of the animals was
only liable for what the animals destroyed at night.

M

555

M 38 ālik related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his father
from Yaḥyā ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Ḥātib that some of Ḥātib’s
slaves stole a she-camel belonging to a man from the Muzayna tribe
and slaughtered it. e case was brought before ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb and ‘Umar ordered Kathīr ibn aṣ-Ṣalṭ to cut oﬀ their hands.
en ‘Umar said to Ḥātib, “I think you must be starving them!” He
added, “By Allah, I will make you pay such a ﬁne that it will be
heavy for you!” He enquired of the man from the Muzayna tribe,
“What was the price of your camel?” e Muzaynī said, “By Allah, I
refused to sell her for 400 dirhams.” ‘Umar said, “Give him 800
dirhams.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “Doubling the price is not the
behaviour of our community. What people have settled on among us
is that the man is obliged to pay the value of the camel or animal on
the day they were taken.”

36.29 Judgement on injuries to domestic animals
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community about injury done to a domestic animal is that the one
who causes the injury must pay the amount by which he has
diminished the animal’s price.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik speak about a camel which attacked
a man and he feared for himself and killed it or hamstrung it. He
said, “If he has clear evidence that it was heading for him and had
attacked him, there are no damages against him. If there is no clear
evidence other than his word, he is responsible for the camel.”

36.30 Judgement regarding articles given to artisans to work on
Yaḥyā related that he heard Mālik say that if a man gives a washer a
garment to dye and he dyed it and then the owner of the garment
says, “I did not order you to use this dye,” and the washer protests
that he had done so, then the washer was to be believed. It was the
same with tailors and goldsmiths. ey are to take an oath about it
556

unless they produced something which they would not normally
have been employed to do. In that situation their statement is not
allowed and the owner of the garment has to take an oath. If he
rejects that and refuses to swear on oath, then the dyer is made to
take an oath.
Yaḥyā said, “I heard Mālik speak about a dyer who was given a
garment and made a mistake and gave it to the wrong person, and
then the person to whom he gave it wore it. He said, “e person
who wears it has no damages against him and the washer pays
damages to the owner of the garment. is happens when the man
wears the garment which he was given without recognising that it is
not his. If he wears it knowing that it is not his garment, then he is
held responsible for it.”

36.31 Judgement on taking on debts and transfers of debts
Yaḥyā related that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community about a man who refers a creditor to another man for
the debt he owes him is that, if the one referred to goes bankrupt or
dies and does not leave enough to discharge the debt, then the
creditor has nothing against the one who referred him and the debt
does not revert to the ﬁrst party.”
Mālik said, “is is the way of doing things about which there is no
dispute in our community.”
Mālik said, “If a man has his debt to somebody taken on for him by
another man and then the man who took it on dies or goes
bankrupt, then whatever was taken on by him reverts to the ﬁrst
debtor.”

36.32 Judgement on garments bought which have defects
Yaḥyā related that he heard Mālik say, “If a man buys a garment
which has a defect, a burn or something else which the seller knows
about and it is testiﬁed against him or he acknowledges it, and the
man who has bought it causes a new tear which decreases the price
557

of the garment, he can return it to the seller and he is not liable for
his tearing it.
“If a man buys a garment which has a defect, a burn or a ﬂaw, and
the one who sold it to him claims that he did not know about it, and
the buyer has cut the garment or dyed it, then the buyer has an
option. If he wishes, he can have a reduction according to what the
burn or ﬂaw detracts from the price of the garment and he can keep
the garment, or if he wishes to pay damages for what the cutting or
dyeing has decreased of the price of the garment and return it, he
can do so.
“If the buyer has dyed the garment with a dye which increases the
value, the buyer has an option. If he wishes, he has a reduction from
the price of the garment according to what the defect diminishes or,
if he wishes to become a partner with the one who sold the garment,
he does so. e price of the garment with the burn or ﬂaw is looked
at. If the price is ten dirhams, and the amount by which the dyeing
increases the value is ﬁve dirhams, then they are partners in the
garment, each according to his share. Taken into reckoning is the
amount by which the dyeing increases the price of the garment.”

36.33 What is not permitted in giving gifts (1)
39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ḥumayd

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf and from Muḥammad ibn an-Nu‘mān
ibn Bashīr and they related to him that an-Nu‘mān ibn Bashīr said
that his father, Bashīr, brought him to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
and said, “I have given this son of mine one of my slaves.” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked, “Have you given each of your children
something similar?” He said, “No.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“en take the slave back.”
40 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr
that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq

gave me some palm-trees which produced twenty awsāq from his
property in al-Ghāba. When he was dying, he said, ‘By Allah, little
558

daughter, there is no one I would prefer to be wealthy after I die
than you. ere is no one it is more diﬃcult for me to see poor after
I die than you. I gave you some palm-trees which produce twenty
awsāq. If you had cut them and taken possession of them, they
would have been yours, but today they are the property of the heirs
who are your two brothers and two sisters, so divide it according to
the Book of Allah.’”
‘Ā’isha continued, “I said, ‘My father! By Allah, even if it had been
more, I would have left it! ere is only Asmā’. Who is my other
sister?’ Abū Bakr replied, ‘What is in the womb of Kharīja. I think
that it is going to be a girl.’”
41 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr

from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Abd al-Qārī that ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb
said, “What is wrong with men who give their sons gifts and then
keep hold of them? If the son dies, they say, ‘My property is in my
possession and I did not give it to anyone.’ But if they themselves
are dying, they say, ‘It belongs to my son. I gave it to him.’ If
someone gives a gift and does not hand it over to the one to whom
it was given, the gift is invalid and, if he dies, it belongs to the heirs
in general.”

36.34 What is not permitted in giving gifts (2)
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community about someone who gives a gift, without intention of
reward, is that he calls witnesses to it. It is conﬁrmed as belonging
to the one to whom it has been given unless the giver dies before the
one to whom it was given receives the gift.”
He added, “If the giver wants to keep the gift after he has had it
witnessed he cannot. If the recipient claims it from him, he takes
it.”
Mālik said, “If someone gives a gift and then withdraws it and the
recipient brings a witness to testify for him that he was given the
559

gift, be it goods, gold, silver or animals, the recipient is made to take
an oath. If he refuses, the giver is made to take an oath. If he also
refuses to take an oath, he gives to the recipient what he claims
from him, if he has at least one witness. If he does not have any
witness, then he has no claim.”
Mālik said, “If someone gives a gift, not expecting anything in
return, and then the recipient dies, the heirs take his place. If the
giver dies before the recipient has received his gift, the recipient has
nothing. at is because he was given a gift which he did not take
possession of. If the giver wants to keep it, and he has already called
witnesses to the gift, he cannot do so. When the recipient claims his
right, he takes it.”

36.35 Judgement on gifts
42 Mālik related to me from Dāwūd ibn al-Husayn from Abū

Ghaṭafān ibn Ṭarīf al-Murrī that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “ If
someone gives a gift to strengthen ties with a relative or as ṣadaqa,
he cannot have it returned. If someone, however, gives a gift seeking
by it favour or reward, he has the right to his gift and can reclaim it,
if he does not have satisfaction from it.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e generally agreed on way of
doing things in our community is that if the gift is returned to the
one who gave it for some recompense, and its value has been either
increased or decreased, the one to whom it has been given only gives
the owner its value on the day he received it.”

36.36 Taking back ṣadaqa
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e way of doing things in our
community about which there is no dispute is that if a man gives
ṣadaqa to his son – ṣadaqa which the son takes possession of or
which is in the father’s keeping and the father has had his ṣadaqa
witnessed – he cannot take it back any of it because he cannot
reclaim any ṣadaqa.”
560

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e generally agreed on way of
doing things in our community in the case of someone who gives his
son a gift, or grants him a gift which is not ṣadaqa, is that he can
take it back as long as the child does not start a debt, which people
claim from him and which they trust him for, on the strength of the
gift which his father has given him. e father cannot take back
anything from the gift after debts are started against it.”
“If a man gives his son or daughter something and a woman marries
the son only on account of the wealth and property which his father
has given him and then the father wants to take it back, or if a man
marries a woman whose father has given her a gift and he marries
her with an increased bride-price because of the wealth and property
that her father has given her, and then the father says, ‘I take it
back,’ the father cannot then take back any such gift from the son or
the daughter if the situation is as described.”

36.37 Judgement on life grants
43 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Abū Salama ibn ‘Abd

ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf from Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh al-Anṣārī that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If someone is given a life grant for
himself and his posterity, it belongs to the person to whom it has
been given. It never reverts to the one who gave it because he gave a
gift and the rules of inheritance apply to it.”
44 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān

ibn al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad heard Makḥūl ad-Dimashqī ask alQāsim ibn Muḥammad about the life grant and what people said
about it. Al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad said, “I have only come upon
people who keep to the conditions they make about their property
and what they are given.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community is that the life grant reverts to the one who makes it a
life grant unless he says, ‘It belongs to you and your posterity.’”

561

45 Mālik

related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar
inherited the house of Ḥafṣa bint ‘Umar. He said, “Ḥafṣa gave
lodging to the daughter of Zayd ibn al-Khaṭṭāb for as long as she
lived. When Zayd’s daughter died, ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar took
possession of the dwelling and considered it to be his.”

36.38 e ruling on lost property which is found
46 Mālik related to me from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān from

Yazīd, the mawlā of al-Munba‘ith that Zayd ibn Khālid al-Juhanī
said, “A man came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and asked him
about ﬁnds. He said, ‘Note the details of the object found and then
publicise it for a year. If the owner comes, give it to him. If not, then
it is your business.’ He said, ‘What about lost sheep, Messenger of
Allah?’ He replied, ‘ey are yours, your brother’s or the wolf ’s.’ He
asked, ‘And the lost camel?’ He said, ‘It is none of your concern. It
has its water and its feet. It will reach water and eat trees until its
owner ﬁnds it.’”
47 Mālik related to me from Ayyūb ibn Mūsā from Mu‘āwiya ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn Badr al-Juhanī that his father informed him that he
stopped with some people on the way to Syria and found a purse
which contained eighty dinars. He mentioned that to ‘Umar ibn alKhattāb. ‘Umar told him, “Announce it at the doors of the mosques
and mention it to everyone who comes from Syria for a year. When
a year passes, it is your business.”
48 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that a man found something and

went to Ibn ‘Umar and said to him, “I have found something. What
do you think I should do about it?” ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said to him,
“Make it known!” He said, “I have done so.” He said, “Do it again.”
He said, “I have done so.” ‘Abdullāh said, “I do not order you to use
it. If you wished you could have left it.”

36.39 Judgement on slaves using ﬁnds

562

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done in our
community about a slave who ﬁnds something and uses it before the
term which is set for ﬁnds has been reached – which is a year – is
that it is held against his person. Either his master gives the price of
what his slave has used or he surrenders his slave to them as
compensation. If he refrains from using it until the term is reached
which is set for ﬁnds and then uses it, it is a debt against him which
follows him and is not against his person and there is nothing
against his master for it.”

36.40 Judgement on strays
49 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sulaymān ibn

Yasār that ābit ibn aḍ-Ḍahhāk al-Anṣārī told him that he had
found a camel at Ḥarra, so he hobbled it and mentioned it to ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and ‘Umar ordered him to make it known three
times. abit said to him, “at would distract me from the running
of my estate.” ‘Umar said to him, “en let it go where you found
it.”
50 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd ibn al-

Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said while he was leaning his
back against the Ka‘ba, “Whoever takes a stray is astray.”

51 Mālik related to me that he heard Ibn Shihāb said, “ere were

many stray camels in the time of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and they
were left alone. No one touched them until the time of ‘Uthmān ibn
‘Aﬀān. He ordered that they be publicised and then sold, and if the
owner came forward afterwards, he was given their price.”

36.41 Ṣadaqa of the living for the dead
52 Mālik related to me from Sa‘īd ibn ‘Amr ibn Shuraḥbīl ibn Sa‘īd

ibn Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubāda from his father that his father said, “Sa‘d ibn
‘Ubāda accompanied the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬on one of his raids
while his mother was dying in Madīna. Someone told her, ‘Leave a
will.’ She said, ‘About what shall I leave a will? e property is Sa‘d’s
563

property.’ en she died before Sa‘d returned. When Sa‘d ibn
‘Ubāda returned, that was mentioned to him. Sa‘d said, ‘Messenger
of Allah! Will it help her if I give ṣadaqa for her?’ e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Yes.’ Sa‘d said, ‘Such-and-such a garden is ṣadaqa for
her,’ naming the garden.”
53 Mālik related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his father
from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that a man said to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “My mother died suddenly and I think that

if she had spoken, she would have given ṣadaqa. Shall I give ṣadaqa
for her?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Yes.”
54 Mālik related to me that he heard that a man of the Anṣār from

the tribe of Banū al-Ḥārith ibn al-Khazraj gave ṣadaqa to his parents
and then they died. eir son inherited the property he had given
them, which was palm-trees. He asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
about it and he said, “You are rewarded for your ṣadaqa and take it
as your inheritance.”

564

37. Wills and Testaments
37.1 e command to write wills
1 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “It is the duty of a Muslim man who

has something to be given as a bequest not to spend two nights
without having a written will in his possession.”

Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our
community is that when the testator writes something in health or
illness as a bequest, and it involves emancipation of a slave or such
things, he can alter it in any way he chooses until he is on his deathbed. If he prefers to abandon a bequest or change it, he can do so
unless he has made a slave mudabbar – there is no way to change
what he has made mudabbar. He is allowed to change his testament
because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “It is the duty of a Muslim
man who has something to be given as a bequest not to spend two
nights without having a written will in his possession.”
Mālik explained, “Had the testator not been able to change his will
nor what was mentioned in it about freeing slaves, testators might
withhold from making bequests from their property, whether it be
freeing slaves or other than that. A man makes a bequest while he is
healthy or travelling (i.e. he does not wait until he is on his deathbed).”
Mālik summed up, “e way of doing things in our community,
about which there is no dispute, is that he can change whatever he
likes of such things except for the granting of mudabbar status.”

37.2 Permissibility of bequests made by children, simpletons,
lunatics and idiots
2 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn Ḥazm that

‘Amr ibn Sulaym az-Zuraqī informed his father that it had been said
565

to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, “ere is an adolescent boy here who has
not yet reached puberty. He is from the Ghassān tribe and his heir
is in Syria. He has property and the only relative he has here is the
daughter of one of his paternal uncles.” ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
instructed, “Let him make her a bequest.” He willed her a property
called the well of Jusham.
Mālik added, “at property was sold for 30,000 dirhams, and the
daughter of the paternal uncle to whom he willed it was none other
than the mother of ‘Amr ibn Sulaym az-Zuraqī.”
3 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Abū Bakr ibn

Ḥazm that a boy from Ghassān was dying in Madīna while his heir
was in Syria. is was mentioned to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb. He was
told, “So-and-so is dying, should he make a bequest?” He said, “Let
him make a bequest.”

Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that Abū Bakr had said, “He was a boy of ten
or twelve.” Yaḥyā said, “He made the well of Jusham a bequest, and
her family sold it for 30,000 dirhams.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e generally agreed on way of
doing things in our community is that a simpleton, an idiot, or a
lunatic who recovers from time to time can make wills if they have
enough of their wits about them to recognise what they will.
Someone who has not enough wits to recognise what he wills and is
totally lacking in comprehension cannot make a bequest.”

37.3 Limiting bequests to one-third of the estate
4 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Āmir ibn Sa‘d ibn Abī
Waqqās that his father said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came to

me to treat me for a pain which had became hard to bear in the year
of the Farewell Ḥajj. I said, ‘Messenger of Allah, you can see how
far the pain has reached me. I have property and only my daughter
to inherit from me. Shall I give two-thirds of my property as
ṣadaqa?’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘No.’ I asked, ‘Half?’ He
566

said, ‘No.’ en the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, said, ‘A third, and a
third is a lot. Leaving your heirs rich is better than leaving them
poor to beg from people. You never spend anything on maintenance
desiring the Face of Allah by it but that you are rewarded for it, even
what you appoint for your wife.’ Sa‘d said, ‘Messenger of Allah, will
I be left here in Makka after my companions have left for Madīna?’
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘If you are left behind and do
righteous deeds you will increase your degree and elevation by them.
Perhaps you will be left behind so that some people may beneﬁt by
you and others may be harmed by you. O Allah! make the hijra of
my Companions complete and do not turn them back on their
heels. e unfortunate one is Sa‘īd ibn Khawla.’ e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was distressed on his account for he had died at Makka.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik speak about a man who willed a
third of his property to a man and said as well, “My slave will serve
so-and-so (another man) for as long as he lives, then he is free,”
then that was investigated and the slave was found to constitute a
third of the property of the deceased. Mālik said, “e service of the
slave is evaluated. en the two of them divide it between them.
e one who was willed a third takes his third and the one who was
willed the service of the slave takes what was evaluated for him of
the slave’s service. Each of them takes from the service of the slave
or from his wage, if he has a wage, according to his share. If the one
who was given the service of the slave for as he long as lived dies,
then the slave is set free.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik speak about someone who willed his
third and said, “So-and-so has such-and-such and so-and-so has
such-and-such,” naming some of his property and his heirs
protested that it was more than a third.” Mālik said, “e heirs then
have an option between giving the beneﬁciaries their full bequests or
dividing among the beneﬁciaries the third of the property of the
deceased and surrendering to them their third. If they wish, their
rights in it reach as far as they reach.”

567

37.4 Dealing with the property of a pregnant woman, a sick
person and someone present in battle
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e best of what I have heard
about the testament of the pregnant woman and about what
settlements she is permitted to make from her property is that the
pregnant woman is like a sick person. When the sickness is slight
and one does not fear for the sick person, he does with his property
what he likes. If the illness is such that his life is feared for, he can
only dispose of a third of his estate.”
He said, “It is the same with a woman who is pregnant. e
beginning of the pregnancy is good news and joy. It is not illness
and not to be feared because Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, says in
His Book, ‘So We gave her the good news of Isḥāq and Ya‘qūb after
Isḥāq’ (11:71). And He says, ‘She bore a light load and carried it
around. en when it became heavy they called on Allah, their
Lord, ‘If You grant us a healthy child, we will be among the
thankful!”’ (7:189)
“When a pregnant woman becomes heavy, she is only permitted to
dispose of a third of her estate. e beginning of this restriction is
after six months. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in His Book,
‘Mothers should nurse their children for two full years.’ (2:233) And
He says, ‘His bearing and weaning take thirty months.’ (46:15)
“When six months have gone by since the woman conceived, she is
only permitted to dispose of a third of her property.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “A man who is advancing in the
ranks for battle can only dispose of a third of his property. He is in
the same position as a pregnant woman or an ill person who is
feared for as long as that situation pertains.”

37.5 Bequests to heirs and right of possession
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “is āyat is abrogated. It is the
word of Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, ‘If he has some goods to
568

leave, to make a will in favour of his parents and relatives.’ (2:180)
What came down about the division of the ﬁxed shares of
inheritance in the Book of Allah, the Mighty, the Exalted, abrogates
it.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik speak about an invalid who made a
bequest and asked his heirs to give him permission to make a
bequest, when he was so ill that he only had command of a third of
his property, and they gave him permission to leave some of his
heirs more than his third. Mālik said, “ey cannot revoke that.
Had they been permitted to do so, every heir would have done that
and then when the testator died, they would take that for
themselves and prevent him from bequeathing his third and what
was permitted to him with respect to his property.”
Mālik said, “If he asks permission of his heirs to grant a bequest to
an heir while he is well and they give him permission, that is not
binding on them. e heirs can rescind that if they wish. at is
because when a man is well, he is entitled to all his property and can
do what he wishes with it. If he wishes, he can spend all of it. He
can spend it and give ṣadaqa with it or give it to whomever he likes.
His asking permission of his heirs is permitted for the heirs when
they give him permission when authority over all his property is
closed oﬀ from him and nothing outside of the third is permitted to
him, and when they are more entitled to two-thirds of his property
than he himself is. at is when their permission becomes relevant.
If he asks one of the heirs to give his inheritance to him when he is
dying and the heir agrees and then the dying man does not dispose
of it at all, it is returned to the one who gave it unless the dying man
says to him, ‘So-and-so (one of his heirs) is weak, and I would like
you to give him your inheritance.’ So he gives it to him. at is
permitted when the dying man speciﬁes it for him.”
Mālik said, “When a man gives the dying man free use of his share
of the inheritance, and the dying man distributes some of it and

569

some remains, the residue is returned to the giver after the man has
died.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik speak about someone who made a
bequest and mentioned that he had given one of his heirs something
which he had not yet taken possession of, so the heirs refused to
permit that. Mālik said, “Such a gift returns to the heirs as
inheritance according to the Book of Allah, because the deceased
did not mean that to be taken out of the third and the heirs do not
have a portion in the third (which the dying man is allowed to
bequeath).”

37.6 Eﬀeminate men and the custody of children
5 Mālik said from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his father that an

eﬀeminate man was once in the company of Umm Salama, the wife
of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬. He said to ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Umayya while the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was listening. “‘Abdullāh! If Allah grants you
victory over Ṭā’if tomorrow, I will lead you to the daughter of
Ghaylān. She has four folds on her front and eight folds on her
back.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “is sort of man should not
mix freely with you.” (It was customary to allow men with no sexual
inclination to enter freely where there were women.)
6 Mālik related to me that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that he heard al-

Qāsim ibn Muḥammad say, “A woman of the Anṣār was married to
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb. She bore to him ‘Āṣim ibn ‘Umar and then he
separated from her. ‘Umar came to Qubā’ and found his son ‘Āṣim
playing in the courtyard of the mosque. He took him by the arm
and placed him before him on his mount. e child’s grandmother
argued with ‘Umar about the child, so they went to Abū Bakr aṣṢiddīq. ‘Umar said, ‘My son!’ e woman said, ‘My son!’ Abū Bakr
said, ‘Do not interfere between a child and its mother.’ ‘Umar did
not repeat his words.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “is is what I would have done
in that situation.”
570

37.7 Liability for defective goods
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik speak about a man who bought
goods – animals or clothes or wares – and the sale was found to be
not permitted so it was revoked and the one who had taken the
goods was ordered to return the owner his goods. Mālik said, “e
owner of the goods only has their value on the day they were taken
from him, and not on the day they are returned to him. at is
because the buyer is liable for them from the day he took them and
whatever loss is in them after that is against him. For that reason,
their increase and growth is also his. A man may take the goods at a
time when they are selling well and are in demand, and then have to
return them at a time when they have fallen in price and no one
wants them. For instance, the buyer may take the goods from the
other man and sell them for ten dinars or keep them while at that
price. en he may have to return them while their price is only a
dinar. He should not go oﬀ with nine dinars from the seller’s
property. Or perhaps they are taken by the buyer and he sells them
for a dinar or keeps them while their price is only a dinar, then he
has to return them and their value on the day he returns them is ten
dinars. e buyer should not have to pay ten dinars from his
property to the owner. He is only obliged to pay the value of what
he took possession of on the day it was taken.”
He added, “Part of what clariﬁes this is that when a thief steals
goods, only their price on the day he stole them is considered. If
cutting oﬀ the hand is necessary, because the thief is imprisoned
until his situation is examined or he ﬂees and then is caught, the
delay of the cutting oﬀ of the hand does not cancel the ḥadd
punishment which was obliged for him on the day he stole, even if
those goods become cheap after that. Nor does delay oblige cutting
oﬀ the hand if it was not obliged on the day he took those goods,
even if they become expensive after that.”

37.8 General chapter on rendering judgement and aversion to it

571

7 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Abū ad-Dardā’

wrote to Salmān al-Farsī, “Come immediately to the Holy Land.”
Salmān wrote back to him, “Land does not make anyone holy. A
man’s deeds make him holy. I have heard that you were put up as a
doctor to treat and cure people. If you are innocent, then may you
have delight! If you are a quack, then beware lest you kill a man and
enter the Fire!” When Abū ad-Dardā’ judged between two men, and
they turned from him to go, he would look at them and say, “Come
back to me, and tell me your story again. A quack, by Allah!”

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “If someone makes use of a slave
without the permission of his master in anything involving danger
to his person, whose equivalent has a fee, he is liable for what befalls
the slave if anything befalls him. If the slave is safe and his master
asks for his wage for what he has done, that is the master’s right.
is is what is done in our community.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say about a slave who is part free
and part enslaved, “His property is suspended in his hand and he
cannot begin anything with it. He eats from it and clothes himself
in an approved fashion. If he dies, his property belongs to the one to
whom he is enslaved.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e way of doing things in our
community is that a parent can take his child to account for what he
spends on him from the day the child has property, cash or goods if
the parent so desires.”
8 Mālik related to me from ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Dalāf

al-Muzanī from his father that a man from the Juhayna tribe used
to buy camels before people set out for the ḥajj and sell them at a
higher price. en he travelled quickly and used to arrive in Makka
before the others who set out for ḥajj. He went bankrupt and his
situation was put before ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb, who said, “O People!
Al-Usayﬁ‘, al-Usayﬁ‘ of the Juhayna, was satisﬁed with his dīn and
his trustworthiness because it was said of him that he arrived before
the others on ḥajj. He used to incur debts which he was not careful
572

to repay, so all of his property has been eaten up by it. Whoever has
a debt against him, let him come to us tomorrow and we will divide
his property between his creditors. Beware of debts! eir beginning
is a worry and their end is destitution!”

37.9 Damages and injuries caused by slaves
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “e sunna with us about crimes
committed by slaves is that the hand is not cut oﬀ for any harm that
a slave causes a man, or something he pilfers, or something guarded
which he steals, or hanging dates he cuts down or ruins or steals.
Such things are counted against the slave’s person and do not exceed
the price of the slave whether it is little or much. If his master
wishes to give the value of what the slave has taken or ruined, or pay
the blood-price for the injury he has caused, he pays it and keeps his
slave. If he wishes to surrender him, he surrenders him, and none of
that is against him. e master has the option in that.”

37.10 What is permitted in gifts
9 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab

that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān said, “If someone gives something to his
small child who is not old enough to look after it himself, and in
order that his gift might be permitted he makes the gift public and
has it witnessed, the gift is permitted, even if the father keeps
charge of it.”

Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that if a man gives
his small child some gold or silver and then dies whilst it is in his
own keeping, the child has none of it unless the father has set it
aside in coin or placed it with a man to keep for the son. If he has
done that, it is permitted for the son.”

573

38. Setting Free and Walā’
38.1 Freeing a share held in a slave
1 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If a man frees his share of a slave and

has enough money to cover the full price of the slave justly
evaluated, he must buy out his partners so that the slave is
completely freed. If he does not have the money, then he is partially
free.”

Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among us
in the case of a slave whose master makes a bequest to free part of
him after his death: a third, a fourth, a half, or any such share, is
that only the portion of him is freed that his master has named. is
is because the freeing of that portion is only obliged to take place
after the death of the master because the master has the option to
withdraw the bequest as long as he lives. When the slave is freed
from his master, the master is a testator and the testator only has
access to free what he can take from his property, being the third of
the property he is allowed to bequeath, and the rest of the slave is
not free because the man’s property has gone out of his hands. How
can the rest of the slave which belongs to other people be free when
they did not initiate the setting-free and did not conﬁrm it and they
do not have the walā’ established for them? Only the deceased could
do that. He was the one who freed him and the one for whom the
walā’ is conﬁrmed. at is not to be borne by another’s property
unless he bequeaths, within the third of his property, what remains
of a slave to be freed. at is a request against his partners and
inheritors and the partners must not refuse the slave that when it is
within the third of the dead man’s property because there is no harm
in that to the inheritors.”
Mālik said, “If a man frees a third of his slave while he is critically
ill, he must complete the emancipation so he is completely free of
574

him, if it is within the third of his property that he has access to,
because he is not considered to be the same as a man who frees a
third of a slave after his death because had the one who freed a third
of his slave after his death lived, he could have cancelled it and the
slave’s being set free would be of no eﬀect. e master who made
the freeing of the third of the slave irrevocable in his illness would
still have to free all of him if he lived. If he died, the slave would be
set free within the third of the bequest. at is because the
command of the deceased is permissible in his third as the
command of the healthy is permissible in all his property.”

38.2 Making conditions when freeing a slave
2 Mālik said, “A master who frees a slave of his and settles his

emancipation so that his testimony is permitted, his inviolability is
complete, and his right to inherit conﬁrmed, cannot impose
stipulations on him like those imposed on a slave about property or
service, nor can he get him to do anything connected with slavery
because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If a man frees his share of
a slave and has enough money to cover the entire price of the slave
justly evaluated for him, he must give his partners their shares so
that the slave is completely free.”
Mālik commented, “If he owns the slave completely, it is more
proper to free him completely and not mingle any slavery with it.”

38.3 People who free slaves and own no other property
3 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd and somebody else from

al-Ḥasan ibn Abī al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and from Muḥammad ibn Sīrīn
that a man in the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬freed six of his
slaves while he was dying. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬drew lots
between them and freed a third of those slaves.
Mālik added that he had heard that the man did not have any
property besides them.

575

4 Mālik related to me from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that a

man in the time of Abān ibn ‘Uthmān’s governorship freed all of his
slaves and they were his sole property. Abān ibn ‘Uthmān took
charge of the slaves and they were divided into three groups. en
he drew lots on the basis that whichever group drew the short straw
would be free. e straw fell to one of the thirds, and that third was
set free.

38.4 Judgement on the property of slaves when they are set free
5 Mālik related to me that he heard Ibn Shihāb say, “e precedent

in the sunna is that when a slave is set free, his property follows
him.”
Mālik said, “One thing which makes clear that a slave’s property
follows him when he is freed is that when the contract (kitāba) is
written for his freedom, his property follows him even if he does not
stipulate that. at is because the bond of kitāba is the bond of walā’
when it is complete. e property of a slave and a mukātab are not
treated in the same way as any children they may have. eir
children are only treated in the same way as their property. is is
because the sunna, about which there is no dispute, is that when a
slave is freed, his property follows him and his children do not
follow him, and when a mukātab writes the contract for his
freedom, his property follows him but his children do not follow
him.”
Mālik said, “One thing which makes this clear is that, when a slave
or mukātab becomes bankrupt, their property is taken but the
mothers of their children and their children are not taken, because
they are not their property.”
Mālik said, “Another thing which makes it clear is that, when a
slave is sold and the person who buys him stipulates the inclusion of
his property, his children are not included in that property.”

576

Mālik said, “Another thing which makes it clear is that, when a
slave does injury to someone, he and his property are taken, but his
children are not taken.”

38.5 Freeing slaves who are umm walads and a general section on
freeing
6 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “If a slave-girl gives birth to a child by
her master, he must not sell her, give her away, or bequeath her. He
enjoys her and when he dies, she is free.”
7 Mālik related to me that he had heard that a slave-girl, who had

been beaten by her master with a red-hot iron, came to ‘Umar ibn
al-Khaṭṭāb and he set her free.

Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among us
is that a man is not permitted to be set free while he has a debt
which exceeds the value of his property. A boy is not allowed to be
set free until he has reached puberty. e young person, whose
aﬀairs are managed, cannot be set free with his property, even when
he reaches puberty, until he manages his property.”

38.6 Slaves permitted to be freed when a slave must be freed by
obligation
8 Mālik related to me from Hilāl ibn Usama from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār
that ‘Umar ibn al-Ḥakam said, “I went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

and said, ‘Messenger of Allah, a slave-girl of mine was tending my
sheep. I came to her and one of the sheep was missing. I asked her
about it and she said that a wolf had eaten it. I became angry at her,
as I am one of the children of Adam, and struck her on the face. As
it happens, I have to set a slave free, so shall I free her?’ e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬questioned her, ‘Where is Allah?’ She said,
‘In heaven.’ He asked, ‘Who am I?’ She replied, ‘You are the
Messenger of Allah.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Free her.’”

577

9 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Ubaydullāh ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd that one of the Anṣār came to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬with a black slave-girl of his. He said,
“Messenger of Allah, I must set free a slave who is a believer. If you
think that she is a believer, I will set her free.” e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬questioned her, “Do you testify that there is no god but
Allah?” She said, “Yes.” He asked, “Do you testify that Muḥammad
is the Messenger of Allah?” She said, “Yes.” He went on, “Are you
certain about the Rising after death?” She replied, “Yes.” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Free her.”
10 Mālik related to me that he had heard that al-Maqburī said that

Abū Hurayra was asked whether a man who had to free a slave
could free an illegitimate child to fulﬁl that obligation. Abū Hurayra
said, “Yes, that will give satisfaction for him.”
11 Mālik related to me that he had heard that Faḍāla ibn ‘Ubayd alAnṣārī, one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, was

asked whether it was permissible for a man who had to free a slave
to free an illegitimate child. He said, “Yes, that will satisfy his
obligation.”

38.7 Slaves not permitted to be freed when a slave must be freed
by obligation
12 Mālik related to me that he had heard that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar

was asked whether a slave could be bought for the speciﬁc purpose
of fulﬁlling the obligation of freeing a slave and he said, “No.”
Mālik said, “at is the best of what I have heard on the obligation
of freeing slaves. Someone who has to set a slave free because of an
obligation on him may not buy one on the condition that he sets
him free, because by doing so, whatever he buys is not completely a
slave, since he has reduced its price by the condition he has made of
setting him free.”

578

Mālik added, ere is no harm, however, in someone buying a
person expressly to set him free.”
Mālik said, “e best of what I have heard on the obligation of
freeing slaves is that it is not permitted to free a Christian or a Jew
to fulﬁl it, and one does not free a mukātab or a mudabbar or an
umm walad or a slave to be freed after a certain number of years or a
blind person. ere is no harm in freeing a Christian, Jew, or
Magian voluntarily because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in
His Book, ‘…either as a favour then or by ransom.’ (47:4) e favour
is setting-free.”
Mālik said, “As for obligations of freeing slaves which Allah has
mentioned in the Book, one only frees a believing slave for them.”
Mālik said, “It is like that when feeding poor people for kaﬀāra.
One must only feed Muslims and one does not feed anyone who is
following other than the dīn of Islam.”

38.8 Freeing the living for the dead
13 Mālik related to me from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Abī ‘Amra al-

Anṣārī that his mother had wanted to make a bequest, but she
delayed until morning and died. She had intended to set someone
free so ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān said, “I asked al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad,
‘Will it help her if I free a slave for her?’ Al-Qāsim replied, ‘Sa‘d ibn
‘Ubāda said to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “My mother has died,
will it help her if I set a slave free for her?” e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬replied, “Yes.”’”
14 Mālik related to me that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “‘Abd ar-Raḥmān

ibn Abī Bakr died in his sleep and ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet
‫ﷺ‬, set free many slaves for him.”

Mālik said, “is is what I like best of what I have heard on the
subject.”



579

38.9 e excellence of freeing slaves, freeing adulteresses and
illegitimate children
15 Mālik related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his father
from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was asked what was the most excellent kind of slave to
free. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬answered, “e most expensive and

the most valuable to his master.”

16 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar freed an

illegitimate child and its mother.

38.10 e right of the one who sets free to the walā’
17 Mālik related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his father that
‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “Barīra came to me and

said, ‘I have written myself as a mukātab for my people for nine
ūqiyas, one ūqiya per year, so help me.’ ‘Ā’isha said, ‘If your people
agree that I pay it all to them for you and that, if I pay it, your walā’
is mine, then I will do it.’ Barīra went to her masters and told them
that and they did not agree. She came back from her masters while
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was sitting [there]. She said to ‘Ā’isha, ‘I
oﬀered that to them and they refused me unless they had the walā’.’
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬heard that and asked her about it. ‘Ā’isha
told him and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Take her and
stipulate that the walā’ is theirs, for the walā’ is for the one who sets
free.’ So ‘Ā’isha did that and then the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stood
up in front of the people and praised Allah and gave thanks to Him.
en he said, ‘What is wrong with people who make conditions
which are not in the Book of Allah? Any condition which is not in
the Book of Allah is invalid even if it is a hundred conditions. e
decree of Allah is truer and the conditions of Allah are ﬁrmer and
the walā’ only belongs to the one who sets free.’”
18 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that

‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, wanted to buy a slave-girl and set her
free. Her people said, “We will sell her to you provided that her
580

walā’ is ours.” She mentioned that to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and
he said, “Do not let that hinder you for the walā’ only belongs to the
one who sets free.”
19 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Amra bint ‘Abd

ar-Raḥman that Barīra came asking the help of ‘Ā’isha, Umm alMu’minīn. ‘Ā’isha said, “If your masters agree that I pay them your
price in one lump sum and set you free, I will do it.” Barīra
mentioned that to her masters and they said, “No, not unless your
walā’ is ours.” Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd added that ‘Amra bint ‘Abd arRaḥmān claimed that ‘Ā’isha mentioned that to the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Buy her and set her
free. e walā’ only belongs to the one who sets free.”
20 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār from ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade selling or giving

away the walā’.

Mālik said that it was not permissible for a slave to buy himself
from his master on the provision that he could give the walā’ to
whomever he wished, as the walā’ was for the one who set him free,
and that, had a man given permission to his mawlā to give the walā’
to whomever he wished, it would not have been permitted because
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had said, “e walā’ belongs to the one
who sets free.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade selling or giving
away the walā’. And so if it was permitted to his master to stipulate
that for him and to give him permission to give the walā’ to
whomever he liked, then it would be a gift.

38.11 Slaves attracting the walā’ when set free
21 Mālik related to me from Rabi‘a ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that Az-

Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwām bought a slave and set him free. e slave
had children by a free woman. When Az-Zubayr freed him, he
said, “ey are my mawālī.” e man argued, “ey are the mawālī
of their mother. Rather, they are our mawālī.” ey brought the

581

dispute to ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān and ‘Uthmān gave a judgement that
Az-Zubayr had their walā’.
Mālik related to me that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab
was asked who had the walā’ of the children whom a slave had by a
free woman. Sa‘īd said, “If their father dies and he is a slave who
was not set free, their walā’ belongs to the mawālī of their mother.”
Mālik said, “Similarly, in the case of a child of a woman who is a
mawlā who has been divorced by li‘ān, the child is attached to the
mawālī of his mother and they are his mawālī. If he dies, they
inherit from him. If he commits a crime, they pay the blood-money
for him. If his father acknowledges him, he is given a kinship to him
and his walā’ goes to the mawālī of his father – they are his heirs and
pay his blood-money – and his father is punished with the ḥadd
punishment.”
Mālik said, “It is the same for a free-born woman divorced by li‘ān.
If the husband who curses her by li‘ān does not acknowledge her
child, the child is dealt with in the same way except that the rest of
his inheritance, after the inheritance of his mother and his brothers
from his mother, goes to all the Muslims as long as he was not given
kinship to his father. e child of the li‘ān is attached to the
patronage of the mawālī of his mother until his father acknowledges
him, because he does not have a lineage or paternal relations. If his
parentage is conﬁrmed, it goes to his paternal relations.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among us,
about a child of a slave by a free woman while the slave’s father is
free, is that the grandfather (the father of the slave) attracts the
walā’ of his son’s free children by a free woman. ey leave their
inheritance to him as long as their father is a slave. If the father
becomes free, the walā’ returns to his mawālī. If he dies and he is
still a slave, the inheritance and the walā’ go to the grandfather. If
the slave has two free sons, and one of them dies while the father is
still a slave, the grandfather, the father of the father, attracts the
walā’ and the inheritance.
582

Mālik spoke about a slave-girl, married to a slave, who was set free
while she was pregnant and then her husband became free before
she gave birth or after she gave birth. He said, “e walā’ of what is
in her womb goes to the person who set the mother free because
slavery touched the child before the mother was set free. It is not
treated in the same way as a child conceived by its mother after she
has been set free because the walā’ of such a child is attracted by the
father when he is set free.”
Mālik said that, if a slave asked his master’s permission to free a
slave of his and his master gave him permission, the walā’ of the
freed slave went to the master of his master, and his walā’ did not
return to the master who had set him free, even if he were to
become free himself.”

38.12 e inheritance of the walā’
Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn
Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm from ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Abī Bakr
ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Hishām that his father told
him that al-‘Aṣī ibn Hishām had died leaving three sons, two by one
wife and one by another wife. One of the two with the same mother
died and left property and mawālī. His full brother inherited his
property and the walā’ of his mawālī. en he also died and left as
heirs his son and his paternal half-brother. His son said, “I obtain
what my father inherited of property and the walā’ of the mawālī.”
His brother said, “It is not like that. You obtain the property. As for
the walā’ of the mawālī, that is not the case. Do you think that, had
it been my ﬁrst brother who died today, I would not have inherited
from him?” ey argued and went to ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān. He gave a
judgement that the brother had the walā’ of the mawālī.
22

23 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn Ḥazm that

his father told him that he was sitting with Abān ibn ‘Uthmān when
an argument was brought to him between some people from the
Juhayna tribe and some people from the Banū al-Ḥārith ibn alKhazraj. A woman of the Juhayna tribe was married to a man from
583

the Banū al-Ḥarith ibn al-Khazraj called Ibrāhīm ibn Kulayb. She
died and left property and mawālī and her son and husband
inherited from her. en her son died and his heirs said, “We have
the walā’ of the mawālī. Her son obtained that.” ose of the
Juhayna said, “at is not the case. ey are the mawālī of our
female associate. When her child dies, we have their walā’ and we
inherit it.” Abān ibn ‘Uthmān gave a judgement that the people of
the Juhayna tribe did indeed have the walā’ of the mawālī.
24 Mālik related to me that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab

spoke about a man who died and left three sons and left mawālī
whom he had freed. en two of his sons died leaving children. He
said, “e third remaining son inherits the mawālī. When he dies,
his children and his brothers’ children share equally in the walā’ of
the mawālī.”

38.13 e inheritance of slaves set free and the walā’ of Jews and
Christians who set slaves Free
25 Mālik related to me that he had asked Ibn Shihāb about a slave

who was released. He said, “His gives his walā’ to whomever he
likes. If he dies and has not given his walā’ to anyone, his
inheritance goes to the Muslims and his blood-money is paid by
them.”
Mālik said, “e best of what has been heard about a slave who is
released is that no one gets his walā’, his inheritance goes to the
Muslims and they pay his blood-money.”
Mālik said that when the slave of a Jew or Christian became
Muslim and was set free before being sold, the walā’ of the freed
slave went to the Muslims. If the Jew or Christian became Muslim
later, the walā’ still did not revert to him.”
He said, “However, if a Jew or Christian frees a slave of their own
religion, and then the freed person becomes Muslim before the Jew
or Christian who set him free becomes Muslim, and then the one
584

who freed him becomes a Muslim, his walā’ reverts to him because
the walā’ was conﬁrmed for him on the day he set him free.”
Mālik said that the Muslim child of a Jew or Christian inherited the
mawālī of his Jewish or Christian father, when the freed mawlā
became Muslim before the one who set him free became Muslim. If
the freed person was already Muslim when he was set free, the
Muslim children of the Christian or Jew had nothing of the walā’ of
a Muslim slave because the Jew and the Christian did not have the
walā’. e walā’ of a Muslim slaves goes to the Muslim community.

585

39. e Mukātab
39.1 Judgement on the mukātab
1 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “A

mukātab remains a slave as long as any of his kitāba remains
unpaid.”

2 Mālik related to me that he had heard that ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr

and Sulaymān ibn Yasār said, “e mukātab remains a slave as long
as any of his kitāba still remains to be paid.”
Mālik said, “is is my opinion as well.”

Mālik said, “If a mukātab dies and leaves more property than what
remains to be paid of his kitāba, and he has children who were born
during the time of his kitāba or whose kitāba has been written as
well, they inherit any property that remains after the kitāba has been
paid oﬀ.”
3 Mālik related to me from Ḥumayd ibn Qays al-Makkī that a son

of al-Mutawakkil had a mukātab who died at Makka and left
(enough to pay oﬀ ) the rest of his kitāba and he also owed some
debts to people. He also left a daughter. e governor of Makka was
not certain about how to judge in the case so he wrote to ‘Abd alMalik ibn Marwān to ask him about it. ‘Abd al-Malik wrote to him,
“Begin with the debts owed to people and then pay oﬀ what remains
of his kitāba. en divide what remains of the property between the
daughter and the master.”
Mālik said, “What is done among us is that the master of a slave
does not have to give his slave a kitāba if he asks for it. I have not
heard of any of the imāms forcing a man to give a kitāba to his slave.
I have heard that when someone asked about that and said that
Allah the Blessed, the Exalted said, ‘Write a kitāba for them if you
know of good in them’ (24:33), one of the people of knowledge
586

recited these two āyats, ‘When you have come out of iḥrām, then
hunt for game’ (5:3) and ‘en when the prayer is ﬁnished spread
through the earth and seek Allah’s bounty’ (62:10).”
Mālik commented, “It is a way of doing things for which Allah the
Mighty, the Majestic, has given permission to people, and it is not
obligatory for them.”
Mālik said, “I heard one of the people of knowledge say about the
words of Allah the Blessed, the Exalted, ‘Give them some of the
wealth Allah has given you’ (24:33), that it meant that a man give his
slave a kitāba and then reduce the end of his kitāba for him by some
speciﬁc amount.”
Mālik said, “is is what I have heard from the people of knowledge
and what I have seen people doing here.”
Mālik said, “I have heard that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar gave one of his
slaves his kitāba for 35,000 dirhams and then reduced the end of his
kitāba by 5,000 dirhams.”
Mālik said, “What is done among us is that when a master gives a
mukātab his kitāba, the mukātab’s property goes with him but his
children do not go with him unless he stipulates that in his kitāba.”
Yaḥyā said, “I heard Mālik say that in the case of a mukātab who
was the owner of a slave-girl who was pregnant, and neither he nor
his master knew that on the day he was given his kitāba, the child
did not follow him because he was not included in the kitāba. He
belonged to the master. As for the slave-girl, she belonged to the
mukātab because she was his property.”
Mālik said that if a man and his wife’s son (by another husband)
inherited a mukātab from the wife, and the mukātab died before he
had completed his kitāba, they divided his inheritance between
them according to the Book of Allah. If the slave paid oﬀ his kitāba
and then died, the inheritance went to the son of the woman and
the husband had nothing of the inheritance.
587

Mālik said that if a mukātab gave his own slave a kitāba, the
situation was examined. If he wanted to do his slave a favour, and it
was obvious by his making it easy for him, it was not permitted. If,
however, he was giving him a kitāba from desire to ﬁnd money to
pay oﬀ his own kitāba, then he was permitted to do so.
Mālik said that if a man had intercourse with a mukātaba of his and
she became pregnant by him, she had an option. If she liked she
could be an umm walad. If she wished she could conﬁrm her kitāba.
If she did not conceive she still had her kitāba.
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among us,
about a slave who is owned by two men, is that one of them does
not give a kitāba for his share, whether or not his companion gives
him permission to do so, unless they both write the kitāba together,
because that alone would eﬀect setting him free. If the slave were to
fulﬁl what he had agreed on to free half of himself and then the one
who had given a kitāba for half of him was not obliged to complete
his setting-free, that would be in opposition to the words of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, ‘If someone frees his share in a slave and has
enough money to cover the full price of the slave, justly evaluated
for him, he must pay his partners their shares so that the slave is
completely free.”
Mālik said, “If he is not aware of that until the mukātab has met the
terms, or before he has met them, the owner who has written the
kitāba for him returns what he has taken from the mukātab to him,
and then he and his partner divide him according to their original
shares and the kitāba is invalid. He is the slave of both of them in
his original state.”
Mālik spoke about a mukātab who was owned by two men and one
of them granted him a delay in the payment of the right which he
was owed. His partner refused to defer payment and exacted his part
of the due. Mālik said that if the mukātab then died and left
property which did not complete the kitāba, “ey divide it
according to what they are still owed by him. Each of them takes
588

according to his share. If the mukātab leaves more than his kitāba,
each of them takes what remains to them of the kitāba and what
remains after that is divided equally between them. If the mukātab
is unable to pay his kitāba fully, and the one who did not allow him
to defer his payment has exacted more than his associate did, the
slave is still equally between them, and he does not return to his
associates the excess of what he has exacted, because he only exacted
his right with the permission of his associate. If one of them remits
what is owed to him and then the mukātab is unable to pay, he
belongs to both of them, and the one who has exacted something
does not return anything, because he only demanded what he was
owed. at is like the debt of two men in one writing against the
same man. One of them grants him time to pay and the other is
greedy and exacts his due. en the debtor goes bankrupt. e one
who exacted his due does not have to return any of what he took.”

39.2 Assuming responsibility in kitāba
4 Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among

us is that when a group of slaves write their kitāba together in the
same kitāba agreement, and some are responsible for others, and
they are not reduced anything by the death of one of the responsible
ones, and then one of them says, ‘I cannot do it,’ and gives up, his
companions can use him in whatever work he can do, and they help
each other with that in their kitāba until they are freed if they are
freed, or remain slaves if they remain slaves.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among us
is that when a master gives a slave his kitāba, it is not permitted for
the master to let anyone assume the responsibility for the kitāba of
his slave if the slave dies or is incapable. is is not part of the sunna
of the Muslims. at is because, when a man assumes responsibility
to the master of a mukātab for what is owed of the kitāba and then
the master of the mukātab pursues that from the one who has
assumed that responsibility, he takes his money falsely. It is not as if
he is buying the mukātab, so that what he gives is part of the price
589

of something that is his, and neither is the mukātab being freed so
that the price established for him buys his inviolability as a free
man. If the mukātab is unable to meet the payments he reverts to
his master and is his slave. is is because kitāba is not a ﬁxed debt
which can be guaranteed by the master of the mukātab. It is
something which, when it is paid by the mukātab, sets him free. If
the mukātab dies and has a debt, his master is not one of the
creditors for what remains unpaid of the kitāba. e creditors have
precedence over the master. If the mukātab cannot meet the
payments and he owes debts to people, he reverts to being a slave
owned by his master and the debts to people are the liability of the
mukātab. e creditors do not enter with the master into any share
of the price of his person.”
Mālik said, “When people are written together in the same kitāba
agreement and there is no kinship between them by which they
inherit from each other, and some of them are responsible for
others, then none of them are set free before the others until all the
kitāba has been paid. If one of them dies and leaves property and it
is more than all of what is against them, it pays all that is against
them. e excess of the property goes to the master, and none of
those who have been written in the kitāba with the deceased have
any of the excess. e master’s claims are overshadowed by their
claims for the portions which remain against them of the kitāba
which can be fulﬁlled from the property of the deceased because the
deceased had assumed their responsibility and so they must use his
property to pay for their freedom. If the deceased mukātab has a
free child not born in kitāba, and who was not written in the kitāba,
it does not inherit from him because the mukātab was not set free
until he died.”

39.3 Severance in the kitāba for an agreed price
5 Mālik related to me that he heard that Umm Salama, the wife of
the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬made a settlement with her mukātab for an agreed

amount of gold and silver.

590

Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among us
in the case of a mukātab who is shared between two partners is that
one of them cannot make a settlement with him for an agreed price,
according to his portion, without the consent of his partner. at is
because the slave and his property are owned by both of them and so
one of them is not permitted to take any of the property except with
his partner’s consent. If one of them settles with the mukātab and
his partner does not, and he takes the agreed price, and then the
mukātab dies while he has property or is unable to pay, the one who
made the settlement would not have anything of the mukātab’s
property and he could not return what he settled for, so that his
right to the slave’s person would return to him. However, when
someone settles with a mukātab with the permission of his partner
and then the mukātab is unable to pay, it is preferable that the one
who broke with him returns what he has taken from the mukātab in
severance and he can have back his portion of the mukātab. is he
can do. If the mukātab dies and leaves property, the partner who has
kept hold of the kitāba is paid in full the amount of the kitāba
which remains to him against the mukātab from the mukātab’s
property. en what remains of the property of the mukātab is
between the partner who made severance and his partner, according
to their shares in the mukātab. If one of the partners breaks oﬀ with
him and the other keeps the kitāba, and the mukātab is unable to
pay, it is said to the partner who settled with him, ‘If you wish to
give your partner half of what you took, so the slave is divided
between you, then do so. If you refuse, then all of the slave belongs
to the one who held on to possession of the slave.’”
Mālik spoke about a mukātab who was shared between two men
and one of them made a settlement with him with the permission of
his partner. en the one who retained possession of the slave
demanded the like of that for which his partner had settled, or more
than that, and the mukātab could not pay it. He said, “e mukātab
is shared between them because the man has only demanded what is
owed to him. If he demands less than what the one who settled with
him took, and the mukātab cannot manage that, and the one who
591

settled with him prefers to return to his partner half of what he took
so the slave is divided in halves between them, he can do that. If he
refuses then all of the slave belongs to the one who did not settle
with him. If the mukātab dies and leaves property, and the one who
settled with him prefers to return to his companion half of what he
has taken so that the inheritance is divided between them, he can do
so. If the one who has kept the kitāba takes the like of what the one
who has settled with him took, or more, the inheritance is between
them according to their shares in the slave because he is only taking
his right.”
Mālik spoke about a mukātab who was shared between two men
and one of them made a settlement with him for half of what was
due to him with the permission of his partner, and then the one who
retained possession of the slave was willing to take less than what
his partner settled with him for, but the mukātab was unable to pay.
He said, “If the one who made a settlement with the slave prefers to
return half of what he was assigned to his partner, the slave is
divided between them. If he refuses to return it, the one who
retained possession has the portion of the share for which his
partner made a settlement with the mukātab.”
Mālik said, “e explanation of that is that the slave is divided into
two halves between them. ey write him a kitāba together and
then one of them makes a settlement with the mukātab for half his
due with the permission of his partner. at is a fourth of the entire
slave. en the mukātab is unable to continue, so it is said to the
one who settled with him, ‘If you wish, return to your partner half
of what you were awarded and the slave is divided equally between
you.’ If he refuses, the one who held to the kitāba takes in full the
fourth of his partner, for which he made settlement with the
mukātab. He had half the slave, so that now gives him three-fourths
of the slave. e one who broke oﬀ has a fourth of the slave because
he refused to return the equivalent of the fourth share for which he
settled.”

592

Mālik spoke about a mukātab whose master made a settlement with
him and set him free and what remained of his severance was
written against him as debt, then the mukātab died owing debts to
people. He said, “His master does not share with the creditors
because of what he is owed from the severance. e creditors are
dealt with ﬁrst.”
Mālik said, “A mukātab cannot become free of his master whilst he
owes debts to people. He would be set free and ﬁnd himself with
nothing because the people to whom he is in debt have more right
to his property than his master. He is not permitted to do that.”
Mālik said, “According to the way things are done among us, there
is no harm if a man gives a kitāba to his slave and settles with him
for gold and reduces what he is owed of the kitāba, provided only
that the gold is paid immediately. Whoever disapproves of that does
so because he puts it in the category of a debt which a man has
against another man for a set term and then gives him a reduction
and he pays immediately. is is not like such a debt. e mukātab’s
becoming free from his master is dependent on his giving money to
speed up the setting-free. Inheritance, testimony and the ḥudūd are
obliged for him and the inviolability of being set free established for
him. He is not buying dirhams for dirhams or gold for gold. Rather
it is like a man who, having said to his slave, ‘Bring me such-andsuch an amount of dinars and you are free,’ then reduces that for
him, saying, ‘If you bring me less than that, you are free.’ at is not
a ﬁxed debt. If it had been a ﬁxed debt, the master would have been
counted amongst the creditors of the mukātab when he died or went
bankrupt. His claim on the property of the mukātab would be
treated in the same way as theirs.”

39.4 Injuries caused by mukātabs
6 Mālik said, “e best of what I have heard about a mukātab who

injures a man so that blood-money must be paid is that if the
mukātab can pay the blood-money for the injury along with his
kitāba he does so and it is against his kitāba. If he cannot do that,
593

and he cannot pay his kitāba because he must pay the blood-money
of the injury before the kitāba, and he cannot pay the blood-money
of the injury, then his master has an option. If he prefers to pay the
blood-money of the injury, he does so and keeps his slave and he
becomes an owned slave. If he wishes to surrender the slave to the
injured person, he surrenders him. e master does not have to do
more than surrender his slave.”
Mālik spoke about people who were in a general kitāba and one of
them caused an injury which entailed blood-money. He said, “If any
of them does an injury involving blood-money, he and those who
are with him in the kitāba are asked to pay all the blood-money of
that injury. If they pay, they are conﬁrmed in their kitāba. If they do
not pay, and they are incapable of doing so, then their master has an
option. If he wishes, he can pay all the blood-money of that injury
and all the slaves revert to him. If he wishes, he can surrender the
one who alone did the injury and all the others revert to being his
slaves since they could not pay the blood-money of the injury which
their companion caused.”
Mālik said, “e way of doing things about which there is no
dispute among us is that when a mukātab is injured in some way
which entails blood-money or one of the mukātab’s children who is
written with him in the kitāba is injured, their blood-money is the
blood-money of slaves of their value, and what is appointed to them
as their blood-money is paid to the master who has the kitāba and
he reckons that for the mukātab at the end of his kitāba and there is
a reduction for the blood-money that the master has taken for the
injury.”
Mālik said, “e explanation of that is, for example, that he has
written his kitāba for three thousand dirhams and the blood-money
taken by the master for his injury is one thousand dirhams. When
the mukātab has paid his master two thousand dirhams and the
blood-money for his injury is one thousand dirham he is free
straightaway. If the blood-money of the injury is more than what
594

remains of the kitāba, the master of the mukātab takes what remains
of his kitāba and frees him. What remains after the payment of the
kitāba belongs to the mukātab. One must not pay the mukātab any
of the blood-money of his injury in case he might consume it and
use it up. If he could not pay his kitāba completely, he would then
return to his master one-eyed, with a hand cut oﬀ, or crippled in
body. His master only wrote his kitāba against his property and
earnings, and he did not write his kitāba so that he would take the
blood-money for what happened to his child or to himself and then
use it up and consume it. One pays the blood-money of injuries
done to a mukātab and any children of his who are born in his
kitāba, or whose kitāba is written, to the master and he takes it into
account for him at the end of his kitāba.”

39.5 Selling mukātabs
7 Mālik said, “e best of what is said about a man who buys the

mukātab of a man is that if the man wrote the slave’s kitāba for
dinars or dirhams, he does not sell him unless it is for merchandise
which is paid immediately and not deferred, because, if it is
deferred, it would be a debt for a debt. A debt for a debt is
forbidden.”
He said, “If the master has given a mukātab his kitāba in exchange
for certain merchandise in the form of camels, cattle, sheep or
slaves, it is more correct that a buyer buy him for gold, silver, or
diﬀerent goods than the ones his master wrote the kitāba for, and
such a payment must be paid immediately, not deferred.”
Mālik said, “e best of what I have heard about a mukātab when
he is sold is that he is more entitled to buy his kitāba than the one
who buys him, if he can pay his master the price for which he was
sold in cash. at is because his buying himself is his freedom, and
freedom has priority over whatever bequests accompany it. If one of
those who have written the kitāba for the mukātab sells his portion
of him so that a half, a third, a fourth or whatever share of the
mukātab is sold, the mukātab does not have the right of pre595

emption in what is sold of him. at is because it is like the
severance of a partner, and he can only cut oﬀ part of his kitāba with
the permission of his partners, because what is sold of him does not
give him complete rights as a free man and his property is barred
from him, and, by buying part of himself, it is feared that he will
become incapable of completing payment because of what he has
had to spend. at is not like the mukātab buying himself
completely unless whoever has some of the kitāba remaining due to
him gives him permission. If they give him permission, he is more
entitled to what is sold of him.”
Mālik said, “Selling one of the instalments of a mukātab is not
lawful. is is because it is an uncertain transaction. If the mukātab
cannot pay it, what he owes is nulliﬁed. If he dies or goes bankrupt
and he owes debts to people, then the person who bought his
instalment does not take any of his portion with the creditors. e
person who buys one of the instalments of the mukātab is in the
position of the master of the mukātab. e master of the mukātab
does not have a share with the creditors of the mukātab for what he
is owed of his slave’s kitāba. It is the same with the kharāj (a set
amount deducted daily from the slave against his earnings) which
accumulates for a master from the earnings of his slave. e
creditors of the slave do not allow him a share for whatever
deductions have accumulated for him.”
Mālik said, “ere is no harm in a mukātab paying towards his
kitāba with coin or merchandise other than the merchandise for
which he wrote the kitāba, if it is identical with it, on time (for the
instalment) or delayed.”
Mālik said that if a mukātab died and left an umm walad and small
children by her or by someone else, and they would not work and it
was feared that they would be unable to fulﬁl their kitāba, the umm
walad of the father was sold if her price would pay all the kitāba for
them, whether or not she was their mother. ey were paid for and
set free because their father would not have forbidden her sale if he
596

had feared that they would be unable to complete their kitāba. If her
price would not cover the price for them, and neither she nor they
could work, they all reverted to being slaves of the master.
Mālik said, “What is done among us in the case of a person who
buys the kitāba of a mukātab, and then the mukātab dies before he
has paid his kitāba, is that the person who bought the kitāba
inherits from him. If, rather than dying, the mukātab cannot pay,
the buyer has his person. If the mukātab pays his kitāba to the
person who bought him and he is free, his walā’ goes to the person
who wrote the kitāba and the person who bought his kitāba does
not have any of it.”

39.6 e labour of mukātabs
8 Mālik related to me that he heard that ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr, when

asked whether the sons of a man who had a kitāba written for
himself and his children and then died worked for the kitāba of
their father or were slaves, said, “ey work for the kitāba of their
father and they have no reduction at all for the death of their
father.”
Mālik said, “If they are young and unable to work, one does not wait
for them to grow up and they are slaves of their father’s master
unless the mukātab has left what will pay their instalments for them
until they can work. If there is enough to cover their payments from
what he has left, that is paid oﬀ on their behalf and they are left in
their condition until they can work, and then if they pay, they are
free. If they cannot manage it, they are slaves.”
Mālik, speaking about a mukātab who died and left property which
was not enough to cover his kitāba and he also left a child with him
in his kitāba and an umm walad, and the umm walad wanted to
work for them, said, “e money is paid to her if she is trustworthy
and strong enough to work. If she is not strong enough to work and
not trustworthy with property, she is not given any of it and she and

597

the children of the mukātab revert to being slaves of the master of
the mukātab.”
Mālik said, “If people are written together in a single kitāba, and
there is no kinship between them, and some of them are incapable
and others work until they are all set free, those who worked can
claim from those who were unable to the portion of what they paid
for them, because some of them assumed the responsibility for
others.”

39.7 Freeing a mukātab on payment of his due before its term
9 Mālik related to me that he heard Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-Rahmān

and others mention that al-Furāﬁṣa ibn ‘Umar al-Ḥanafī had a
mukātab who oﬀered to pay him all of his kitāba that he owed. AlFurāﬁṣa refused to accept it and the mukātab went to Marwān ibn
al-Ḥakam, who was the governor of Madīna, and brought up the
matter. Marwān summoned al-Furāﬁṣa and told him to accept the
payment, but he refused. Marwān then ordered that the payment be
taken from the mukātab and placed in the treasury. He said to the
mukātab, “Go, you are free.” When al-Furāﬁṣa saw that, he took the
money.
Mālik said, “What is done among us when a mukātab pays all the
instalments he owes before their term is that he is permitted to do
so. e master cannot refuse him that. at is because payment
removes every condition from the mukātab as well as service and
travel. e setting-free of a man is not complete while he has any
remaining slavery, and in such a situation neither would his
inviolability as a free man be complete and his testimony permitted
and inheritance obliged and so on. His master must not make any
stipulation of service on him after he has been set free.”
Mālik said that it was permitted for a mukātab who became
extremely ill and wanted to pay his master all his instalments
because his heirs who were free would then inherit from him and he
had no children with him in his kitāba to do so because by that he
598

completed his inviolability as a free man, his testimony was
permitted, and his admission of what debts he owed to people was
permitted. His bequest was permitted as well. His master could not
refuse him that by claiming that he was escaping from him with his
property.

39.8 e inheritance of a mukātab on emancipation
10 Mālik related to me that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab

was asked about a mukātab who was shared between two men. One
of them freed his portion and then the mukātab died leaving a lot of
money. Sa‘īd replied, “e one who kept his kitāba is paid what
remains due to him, and then they divide what is left between them
both equally.”
Mālik said, “When a mukātab who fulﬁls his kitāba and becomes
free dies, he is inherited from by the people who wrote his kitāba
and their children and paternal relations – whoever is most
deserving.”
He said, “is is also for whoever is set free before he dies – his
inheritance is for the nearest people to him of children or paternal
relations who inherit by means of the walā’.”
Mālik said, “Brothers, written together in the same kitāba, are in the
same position as each other’s children, when none of them have
children written in the kitāba or born in the kitāba. When one of
them dies and leaves property, he pays for them whatever remains
against them of their kitāba and sets them free. e money left over
after that goes to any children he may have rather than to his
brothers.”

39.9 Conditions concerning mukātabs
11 Mālik spoke to me about a man who wrote a kitāba for his slave

for gold or silver and stipulated against him in his kitāba a journey,
service, sacriﬁce or similar, which he speciﬁed by name, and then
the mukātab was able to pay all his instalments before the end of the
599

term. He said, “If he pays all his instalments and is set free and his
inviolability as a free man is complete, but he still has this condition
to fulﬁl, the condition is examined, and whatever involves his person
in it, like service or a journey, etc., is removed from him and his
master has nothing against him for it. Whatever there is of sacriﬁce,
clothing or anything that he must pay that can be treated as dinars
and dirhams, is valued, and he pays it along with his instalments,
and he is not free until he has paid that along with his instalments.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among us,
about which there is no dispute, is that a mukātab is in the same
position as a slave whom his master will free after a service of ten
years. If the master dies before ten years, what remains of his service
goes to his heirs and his walā’ goes to the one who contracted to free
him and to his male children or paternal relations.”
Mālik spoke about a man who stipulated against his mukātab that
he could not travel, marry, or leave his land without his permission,
and that, if he did so without his permission, it was in his power to
cancel the kitāba. He said, “If a mukātab does any of these things, it
is not in the man’s power to cancel the kitāba. Let the master put
that before the ruler. A mukātab, however, should not marry, travel,
or leave the land of his master without his permission, whether or
not he stipulates it. at is because the man may write a kitāba for
his slave for one hundred dinars and the slave may have one
thousand dinars or more. He goes oﬀ and marries a woman and
pays her bride-price which wipes away his money and then he
cannot pay. He reverts to his master as a slave without property. Or
else he may travel and his instalments fall due while he is away. He
cannot do so, and kitāba is not based on such behaviour. at is in
the hand of his master. If he wishes, he gives him permission for it.
If he wishes, he refuses it.”

39.10 e walā’ of the mukātab when he is set free
12 Mālik said, “When a mukātab sets his own slaves free, it is only

permitted with the consent of his master. If his master gives him
600

consent, and the mukātab sets his slave free, his walā’ goes to the
mukātab. If a mukātab then dies before he has been set free himself,
the walā’ of the freed slave goes to the master of the mukātab. If the
freed one dies before the mukātab has been set free, the master of
the mukātab inherits from him.”
Mālik said, “It is the same when a mukātab gives his slave a kitāba
and his mukātab is set free before he is himself. e walā’ goes to
the master of the mukātab as long as he is not free. If the person
who wrote the kitāba is set free, then the walā’ of his mukātab, who
was freed before him, reverts to him. If the ﬁrst mukātab dies before
he pays, or he cannot pay his kitāba and has free children, they do
not inherit the walā’ of their father’s mukātab because the walā’ has
not been established for their father and he does not have the walā’
until he is free.”
Mālik, speaking about a mukātab who was shared between two men
and one of them forewent what the mukātab owed him and the
other insisted on his due, then the mukātab died and left property,
said, “e one who did not abandon any of what he was owed is
paid in full. en the property is divided between them both, just as
if a slave had died, because what the ﬁrst one did was not setting
him free – he only abandoned a debt that was owed to him.”
Mālik explained, “One thing that makes this clear is that when a
man dies and leaves a mukātab, and he also leaves male and female
children, and one of the children frees his portion of the mukātab,
that does not establish any of the walā’ for him. Had it been a true
setting-free, the walā’ would have been established for whichever
men and women freed him.”
Mālik continued, “Another thing that makes this clear is that if one
of them freed his portion and then the mukātab could not pay, the
value of what was left of the mukātab would be adjusted because of
the one who freed his portion. Had it been a true setting-free, his
estimated value would have been taken from the property of the one
who set free until he had been set completely free, as the Messenger
601

of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Whoever frees his share in a slave, justly evaluated
for him, gives his partners their shares. If not he frees of him what
he frees.’”
He added, “Another thing that makes this clear is that part of the
sunna of the Muslims about which there is no dispute, is that
whoever frees his share of a mukātab, the mukātab is not set fully
free using his property. Had he been truly set free, the walā’ would
have been his alone rather than his partners. Another clariﬁcation is
that part of the sunna of the Muslims is that the walā’ belongs to
whoever writes the contract of kitāba. e women who inherit from
the master of the mukātab do not have any of the walā’ of the
mukātab. If they free any of their shares, the walā’ belongs to the
male children of the master of the mukātab or his male paternal
relations.”

39.11 What is not permitted in freeing a mukātab
13 Mālik said, “If people are together in the same kitāba, their

master cannot free one of them without consulting any companions
he may have in the kitāba and obtaining their consent. If they are
young, however, their consultation means nothing and it is not
permitted to them. at is because a man might work for all the
people and he might pay their kitāba for them to complete their
freedom. e master approaches the one who will pay for them, and
on whom their delivery from slavery depends, and frees him and so
makes those who remain unable to pay. He does it intending beneﬁt
and increase for himself. It is not permitted for him to do that to
those of them who remain. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘ere
must be no harm nor return of harm.’ is is the most severe harm.”
Mālik said about slaves who wrote a kitāba together that it was
permitted for their master to free the old and exhausted of them and
the young, when such a one could not pay anything and there was
no help nor strength contributed by them in the kitāba.

39.12 Freeing a mukātab and an umm walad
602

14 Mālik, speaking about a man who had his slave in a kitāba and

then the mukātab died and left his umm walad, and there remained
for him some of his kitāba to pay oﬀ and he left what would cover
it, said, “e umm walad is a slave since the mukātab was not freed
until he died, and he did not leave children that were set free by his
paying what remained, so that the umm walad of their father was
freed by their being set free.”

Mālik said about a mukātab who set free a slave of his or gave
ṣadaqa with some of his property and his master did not know about
it until he had set the mukātab free, “at is what has been done
and the master does not rescind it. If the master of the mukātab
learns about it before he sets the mukātab free, he can reject it and
not permit it. If the mukātab is then freed and it becomes in his
power to do so, he does not have to free the slave nor give the
ṣadaqa unless he does it voluntarily on his own.”

39.13 Bequests involving mukātabs
15 Mālik said, “e best of what I have heard about a mukātab

whose dying master frees him is that the mukātab is valued
according to what he would fetch if he were sold. If that value is less
than what remains against him of his kitāba, his freedom is taken
from the third that the deceased can bequeath. One does not
consider the number of dirhams which remain against him in his
kitāba. at is because, had he been killed, his killer would not be in
debt for other than his value on the day he killed him. Had he been
injured, the one who injured him would not be liable for other than
the blood-money of the injury on the day of his injury. One does
not look at how much he has paid of dinars and dirhams of the
contract he has written because he is a slave as long as any of his
kitāba remains. If what remains in his kitāba is less than his value,
only whatever of his kitāba remains owing from him is taken into
account in the third of the property of the deceased. at is because
the deceased leaves him what remains of his kitāba and so it
becomes a bequest which the deceased has made.”
603

Mālik said, “An illustration of that is that if the price of the
mukātab is one thousand dirhams, and only one hundred dirhams of
his kitāba remain, his master leaves him the one hundred dirhams
which complete it for him. It is taken into account in the third of
his master and by it he becomes free.”
Mālik said that if a dying man wrote his slave a kitāba, the value of
the slave was estimated. If there was enough to cover the price of
the slave in one third of his property, it was permitted for him to do
so.
Mālik said, “An illustration of that is that there is a slave worth one
thousand dinars. His master writes him a kitāba for two hundred
dinars as he is dying. A third of the property of the master is one
thousand dinars, so that is permitted for him. It is simply a bequest
which he makes from one third of his property. If the master has
left bequests to people, and there is no surplus in the third after the
value of the mukātab, one begins with the mukātab, they follow it
because the kitāba is setting-free, and setting-free takes priority
over other bequests. When those bequests are paid from the kitāba
of the mukātab, the heirs of the testator have a choice. If they want
to give the people with bequests all their bequests and the kitāba of
the mukātab is theirs, they have that. If they refuse and hand over
the mukātab and what he owes to the people with bequests they can
do so, because the third commences with the mukātab and because
all the bequests which he makes are as one.”
If the heirs then say, “What our fellow bequeathed was more than
one third of his property and he has taken what was not his,” Mālik
said, “His heirs choose. ey are told, ‘Your companion has made
the bequests you know about and if you would like to give them to
those who are to receive them according to the deceased’s bequests,
then do so. If not, hand over to the people with bequests one third
of the total property of the deceased.’”
Mālik continued, “If the heirs surrender the mukātab to the people
with bequests, the people with bequests have what he owes of his
604

kitāba. If the mukātab pays what he owes of his kitāba, they take
that as their bequests according to their shares. If the mukātab
cannot pay, he is a slave of the people with bequests and does not
return to the heirs, because they gave him up when they made their
choice, and because when he was surrendered to the people with
bequests, they were liable. If he died, they would not have anything
against the heirs. If the mukātab dies before he pays his kitāba and
he leaves property worth more than what he owes, his property goes
to the people with bequests. If the mukātab pays what he owes, he is
free and his walā’ returns to the paternal relations of the one who
wrote the kitāba for him.”
Mālik, speaking about a mukātab who owed his master ten
thousand dirhams in his kitāba and, when the master died, he
remitted one thousand dirhams from it, said, “e mukātab is
valued and his value is looked at. If his value is one thousand
dirhams and the reduction is a tenth of the kitāba, that portion of
the slave’s price is one hundred dirhams, being a tenth of the price.
A tenth of the kitāba is therefore reduced for him – that is
converted to a tenth of the price in cash. at is as if he had had all
of what he owed reduced for him. Had he done that, only the value
of the slave – one thousand dirhams – would have been taken into
account in the third of the property of the deceased. If that which
he had remitted is half of the kitāba, half the price is taken into
account in the third of the property of the deceased. If it is more or
less than that, it is according to this reckoning.”
Mālik said, “When a man reduces the kitāba of his mukātab by one
thousand dirhams at his death from a kitāba of ten thousand
dirhams, and he does not stipulate whether it is from the beginning
or the end of his kitāba, each instalment is reduced for him by onetenth.”
Mālik said, “If a man dies and remits one thousand dirhams from
his mukātab from the beginning or the end of his kitāba, and the
original basis of the kitāba is three thousand dirhams, then the
605

mukātab’s cash value is estimated. en that value is divided. at
thousand which is from the beginning of the kitāba is converted
into its portion of the price according to its proximity to the term
and its precedence, and then the thousand which follows the ﬁrst
thousand is according to its precedence in the order until the end.
Every thousand is paid according to its place in advancing and
deferring the term because what is deferred of that is less in respect
of its price. en it is placed in the third of the deceased according
to whatever of the price befalls that thousand according to the
diﬀerence in preference of that, whether it is more or less, then it is
according to this reckoning.”
Mālik, speaking about a man bequeathing another man a fourth of a
mukātab, or freeing a fourth, and then the ﬁrst man died and the
mukātab died and left a lot of property, more than he owed, said,
“e heirs of the ﬁrst master and the one who was willed a fourth
has a third of what is left over, and the one willed a fourth has a
third of what is left over after the kitāba is paid. e heirs of his
master get two-thirds. at is because the mukātab is a slave as long
as any of his kitāba remains to be paid. He is inherited from by the
possession of his person.”
Mālik said about a mukātab whose dying master frees him, “If the
third of the deceased will not cover him, he is freed from it
according to what the third will cover and his kitāba is decreased
accordingly. If the mukātab owed ﬁve thousand dirhams and his
value is two thousand dirhams cash, and the third of the deceased
amounts to one thousand dirhams, half of him is freed and half of
the kitāba has been reduced for him.”
Mālik said about a man who said in his will, “My slave so-and-so is
free and write a kitāba for so-and-so” that the setting-free had
priority over the kitāba.

606

40. e Mudabbar
40.1 Judgement on the mudabbar
1 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “What is done in our

community in the case of a man who makes his slave-girl a
mudabbara and she gives birth to children after that, and then the
slave-girl dies before the one who gave her a tadbīr, is that her
children are in her position. e conditions which were conﬁrmed
for her are conﬁrmed for them. e death of their mother does not
harm them. If the one who made her mudabbara dies, they are free
if their value is less than one-third of his total property.”
Mālik said, “For every mother by birth, as opposed to mother by
suckling, her children are in her position. If she is free and she gives
birth after she is free, her children are free. If she is a mudabbara or
mukātaba, or freed after a number of years in service, or part of her
is free and pledged, or she is an umm walad, any children she has
are in the same position as their mother. ey are set free when she
is set free and they are slaves when she is a slave.”
Mālik said about the mudabbara given a tadbīr while she was
pregnant, “Her children are in her position. at is also the position
of a man who frees his slave-girl while she is pregnant and does not
know that she is pregnant.”
Mālik said, “e sunna about such women is that their children
follow them and are set free by their being set free.”
Mālik said, “It is the same as if a man had bought a slave-girl while
she was pregnant. e slave-girl and what is in her womb belong to
the one who has bought her whether or not the buyer stipulates
that.”
Mālik continued, “It is not lawful for the seller to make an exception
about what is in her womb because that is an uncertain transaction.
607

It reduces her price and he does not know if that will reach him or
not. It is as if one were selling the foetus in the womb of the mother.
at is not lawful because it is an uncertain transaction.”
Mālik said about the mukātab or mudabbar who bought a slave-girl
and had intercourse with her and she became pregnant by him and
gave birth, “e children of either of them by a slave-girl are in the
same position as himself. ey are set free when he is set free and
they are slaves while he is a slave.”
Mālik said, “When he is set free, the umm walad is part of his
property which is surrendered to him when he is set free.”

40.2 General section on tadbīr
2 Mālik, speaking about a mudabbar who says to his master, “Free

me immediately and I will give you ﬁfty dinars which I will have to
pay in instalments,” and his master says, “Yes, you are free and you
must pay me ﬁfty dinars and you will pay me ten dinars every year,”
and the slave is satisﬁed with this, then the master dies one, two or
three days later, said, “e freeing is conﬁrmed and the ﬁfty dinars
become a debt against him. His testimony is permitted, his
inviolability as a free man is conﬁrmed, as are his inheritance and
his liability to the full ḥudūd punishments. e death of his master,
however, does not reduce the debt for him at all.”
Mālik said that if a man who made his slave a mudabbar died and
he had some property on hand and some absent property, and in the
property on hand there was not enough (in the third he was allowed
to bequeath) to cover the value of the mudabbar, the mudabbar was
kept there together with the property, and his tax (kharāj) was
gathered until the master’s absent property was clear. en if a third
of what his master left would cover his value, he was freed with his
property and what had gathered of his tax. If there was not enough
to cover his value in what his master had left, as much of him was
freed as the third would allow, and his property was left in his
hands.
608

40.3 Bequests involving tadbīr
3 Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our

community is that any setting-free, which a man makes in a bequest
that he wills in health or illness, can be rescinded by him when he
likes and changed when he likes, as long as it is not a tadbīr. ere is
no way to rescind a tadbīr once he has made it.

“As for every child born to him by a slave-girl whom he wills to be
set free but does not make mudabbara, her children are not freed
with her when she is freed. at is because her master can change
his will when he likes and rescind it when he likes, and being set
free is not conﬁrmed for her. She is in the position of a slave-girl
whose master says, ‘If so-and-so remains with me until I die, she is
free.’” (i.e. he does not make a deﬁnite contract.)
Mālik said, “If she fulﬁls such a condition, that right is hers. If he
wishes to do so before the fulﬁlment of the condition, he can sell
her and her child, because he has not included her child in any
condition he has made for her.
“e bequest of setting-free is diﬀerent from tadbīr. e precedent
of the sunna makes a distinction between them. Had a bequest been
in the position of a tadbīr, no testator would be able to change his
will and whatever he mentioned in it of setting-free. His property
would be tied up and he would not be able to use it.”
Mālik said about a man who made all his slaves mudabbar while he
was well and they were his only property, “If he made some of them
mudabbar before the others, one begins with the ﬁrst until the third
of his property is reached (i.e. their value is matched against the
third, and those whose value are covered are free.) If he makes them
all mudabbar in his terminal illness and says in one statement, ‘Soand-so is free. So-and-so is free. So-and-so is free if my death
occurs in this illness,’ or he makes them all mudabbar in the same
statement, they are matched against the third and one does not
begin with any of them before the others. It is a bequest and they
609

have a third of his property divided between them in shares. en
the third of his property frees each of them according to the extent
of his share. No single one of them is given preference when that all
occurs in his illness.”
Mālik spoke about a master who made his slave a mudabbar and
then he died and the only property he possessed was the mudabbar
slave and the slave had property. He said, “A third of the mudabbar
is freed and his property remains in his possession.”
Mālik said about a mudabbar whose master gave him a kitāba and
then the master died and did not leave any property other than him,
“A third of him is freed and a third of his kitāba is reduced, and he
owes two-thirds.”
Mālik spoke about a man who freed half of his slave while he was ill
and made irrevocable his freeing half of him or all of him, and he
had made another slave of his mudabbar before that. He said, “One
begins with the slave he made mudabbar before the one he freed
while he was ill. at is because the man cannot revoke what he has
made mudabbar and cannot follow it with a matter which will
rescind it. When this mudabbar is freed, then what remains of the
third goes to the one who had half of him freed so as to complete
his setting-free entirely in the third of the property of the deceased.
If what is left of the third does not cover that, whatever is covered
by what is left of the third is freed after the ﬁrst mudabbar is freed.”

40.4 A master’s intercourse with his mudabbara
4 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar made

two of his slave-girls mudabbara, and he had intercourse with them
while they were mudabbara.
5 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd ibn al-

Musayyab used to say, “When a man makes his slave-girl
mudabbara he can have intercourse with her. He cannot, however,

610

sell her or give her away and her children are in the same position as
her.”

40.5 Selling mudabbars
6 Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our

community about a mudabbar is that the owner cannot sell him or
change the position in which he has put him. If a debt overtakes the
master, his creditors cannot sell the mudabbar as long as the master
is still alive. If the master dies and has no debts, the mudabbar is
included in the third (of the bequest) because the master expected
his work from him as long as he lived. He cannot serve the master
all of his life, and then have the master free him from his heirs out
of the main portion of his property when he dies. If the master of
the mudabbar dies and has no property other than him, one third of
him is freed, and two-thirds of him belong to the heirs. If the
master of the mudabbar dies and owes a debt which encompasses
the mudabbar, he is sold to meet the debt because he can only be
freed in the third (which is allowed for the bequests).”
He said, “If the debt only includes half of the slave, half of him is
sold for the debt. en a third of what remains after the debt is
freed.”

Mālik said, “It is not permitted to sell a mudabbar and it is not
permitted for anyone to buy him unless the mudabbar buys himself
from his master. He is permitted to do that. Or else someone gives
the master of a mudabbar money to free him. at is also permitted
for him.”
Mālik said, “His walā’ belongs to his master who made him a
mudabbar.”
Mālik said, “It is not permitted to sell the service of a mudabbar
because it is an uncertain transaction since one does not know how
long his master will live. at is uncertain and it is not good.”

611

Mālik spoke about a slave who was shared between two men and
one of them made his portion mudabbar. He said, “ey estimate
his value between them. If the one who made him mudabbar buys
him, he is all mudabbar. If he does not buy him, his tadbīr is
revoked unless the one who retains ownership of him wishes to give
his partner who made him mudabbar his value. If he gives him to
him for his value, that is binding, and he is all mudabbar.”
Mālik spoke about the Christian man who made a Christian slave of
his mudabbar and then the slave became Muslim. He said, “One
separates the master and the slave, and the slave is removed from his
Christian master and is not sold until his situation becomes clear. If
the Christian dies owing a debt, his debt is paid from the price of
the slave unless he has in his estate enough to cover the debt. en
the mudabbar is set free.”

40.6 Injuries caused by mudabbars
7 Mālik related to me that he heard that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz

gave a judgement about the mudabbar who did an injury. He said,
“e master must surrender what he owns of him to the injured
person. He is made to serve the injured person and recompense (in
the form of service) is taken from him as the blood-money of the
injury. If he completes that before his master dies, he reverts to his
master.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our
community about a mudabbar who does an injury and then his
master dies and the master has no property except him is that the
third (allowed to be bequeathed) is freed, and then the bloodmoney for the injury is divided into thirds. A third of the bloodmoney is against the third of him which was set free, and two-thirds
are against the two-thirds which the heirs have. If they wish, they
surrender what they have of him to the party with the injury, and if
they wish, they give the injured person two-thirds of the bloodmoney and keep their portion of their slave. at is because that
injury is a criminal action by the slave and it is not a debt against the
612

master by which whatever setting-free and tadbīr the master had
done would be abrogated. If there were a debt to people against the
master of the slave, as well as the criminal action of the slave, part of
the mudabbar would be sold in proportion to the blood-money of
the injury and according to the debt. en one would begin with the
blood-money which was for the criminal action of the slave and it
would be paid from the price of the slave. en the debt of his
master would be paid, and then one would look at what remained of
the slave after that. His third would be set free, and two-thirds of
him would belong to the heirs. at is because the criminal action of
the slave is more pressing than the debt of his master, and so, if the
man dies and leaves a mudabbar slave whose value is one hundred
and ﬁfty dinars, and the slave strikes a free man on the head with a
blow that lays the skull open, and the blood-money is ﬁfty dinars,
and the master of the slave has a debt of ﬁfty dinars, one begins
with the ﬁfty dinars which are the blood-money of the head wound,
and it is paid from the price of the slave. en the debt of the
master is paid. en one looks at what remains of the slave, and a
third of him is set free and two-thirds of him remain for the heirs.
e blood-money is more pressing against his person than the debt
of his master. e debt of his master is more pressing than the
tadbīr which is a bequest from the third of the property of the
deceased. None of the tadbīr is permitted while the master of the
mudabbar has a debt which is unpaid, since it is a bequest. at is
because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says, ‘After any bequest
made or any debts.’ (4:11).”
Mālik continued, “If there is enough in the third of the property
that the deceased can bequeath to free all the mudabbar, he is freed
and the blood-money due from his criminal action is held as a debt
against him, which follows him after he is set free, even if that
blood-money is the full blood-money. It is not a debt on the
master.”
Mālik spoke about a mudabbar who injured a man and his master
surrendered him to the injured party, and then the master died and
613

had a debt and did not leave any property other than the mudabbar.
e heirs said, “We oﬀered to surrender the mudabbar to the
injured party.” whilst the creditor said, “My debt exceeds that.”
Mālik said that if the creditor’s debt did not exceed that at all, he
was more entitled to it and it was taken from the one who owed the
debt, according to what the creditor was owed in excess of the
blood-money of the injury. If his debt did not exceed it at all, he did
not take the slave.
Mālik spoke about a mudabbar who did an injury and had property,
and his master refused to stand security for him. He said, “e
injured party takes the property of the mudabbar for the bloodmoney of his injury. If there is enough to pay it, the injured party is
paid in full for the blood-money of his injury and the mudabbar is
returned to his master. If there is not enough to pay it, he takes the
blood-money from it and uses the mudabbar for what remains of
the blood-money.”

40.7 Injuries caused by an umm walad
Mālik said in the case of an umm walad who injured someone, “e
blood-money of the injury is the responsibility of her master from
his property, unless the blood-money of the injury is greater than
the value of the umm walad. Her master does not have to pay more
than her value. at is because when the master of a slave or slavegirl surrenders his slave or slave-girl for an injury which one of them
has done, he does not owe any more than that, even if the bloodmoney is greater. As the master of the umm walad cannot surrender
her because of the precedent of the sunna, it is as if he had
surrendered her when he pays her price. He does not have to pay
more than that. is is the best of what I have heard about the
matter. e master is not obliged to assume responsibility for more
than an umm walad’s value because of her criminal action.”

614

41. Ḥudūd
41.1 Stoning
1 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said,
“e Jews came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and mentioned to him

that a man and woman from among them had committed adultery.
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked them, ‘What do you ﬁnd in the
Torah about stoning?’ ey said, ‘We make their wrong action
known and ﬂog them.’ ‘Abdullāh ibn Salām said, ‘You have lied! It is
stoning for it, so bring the Torah!’ ey spread it out and one of
them placed his hand over the verse of stoning. en he read what
was before and after it. ‘Abdullāh ibn Salām told him to lift his
hand. He lifted his hand and there was the verse of stoning. ey
said, ‘He has spoken the truth, Muḥammad. e verse of stoning is
in it.’ So the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave the order and they were
stoned.”
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar added, “I saw the man leaning over the woman
to protect her from the stones.”
Mālik commented, “By ‘leaning’ he meant throwing himself over
her so that the stones fell on him.”
2 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd ibn al-

Musayyab that a man from the Aslam tribe came to Abū Bakr aṣṢiddīq and told him, “I have committed adultery.” Abū Bakr said to
him, “Have you mentioned this to anyone else?” He replied, “No.”
Abū Bakr told him, “en cover it up with the veil of Allah. Allah
accepts repentance from His slaves.” He was still unsettled so he
went to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and told him the same as he had said
to Abū Bakr and ‘Umar gave him the same answer as Abū Bakr had
done. He was still unsettled so he went to the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬and said to him insistently, “I have committed adultery.” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬turned away from him three times. Each
615

time the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬turned away from him until it
became too much. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬questioned his family,
“Does he have some illness which aﬀects his mind or is he mad?”
ey said, “Messenger of Allah, he is well.” e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Unmarried or married?” ey replied, “Married,
Messenger of Allah.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬then gave the
order for him to be stoned.
3 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd in alMusayyab said, “I have heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to

a man called Hazzāl from the Aslam tribe, ‘Hazzāl, if you had
veiled him with your cloak, it would have been better for you.’”

Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “I related this ḥadīth in an assembly which
included Yazīd ibn Nu‘aym ibn Hazzāl al-Aslamī. Yazīd said,
‘Hazzāl was my grandfather. is ḥadīth is true.’”
4 Mālik related to me that Ibn Shihāb informed him that a man had

confessed that he had committed adultery in the time of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he testiﬁed against himself four times, so
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave the order for him to be stoned.
Ibn Shihāb said, “Because of this a man is to be taken for his own
con-fession against himself.”
5 Mālik related to me from Ya‘qūb ibn Zayd ibn Ṭalḥa from his

father, Zayd ibn Talha, that ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Mulayka informed
him that a woman came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and informed
him that she had committed adultery and was pregnant. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told her, “Go away until you give birth.”
When she had given birth she came to him. e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told her, “Go away until you have suckled and weaned the
baby.” When she had weaned the baby, she came to him. He said,
“Go and entrust the baby to someone.” She entrusted the baby to
someone and then came to him. He gave the order and she was
stoned.

616

6 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Ubaydullāh ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ud that Abū Hurayra and Zayd ibn
Khālid al-Juhanī informed him that two men brought a dispute to
the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. One of them said, “Messenger of Allah,
judge between us by the Book of Allah!” e other, who was the
wiser of the two, said, “Yes, Messenger of Allah, judge between us
by the Book of Allah and give me permission to speak.” He said,
“Speak.” He said, “My son was hired by this person and he
committed fornication with his wife. He told me that my son
deserved stoning and I ransomed him for one hundred sheep and a
slave-girl. en I questioned the people of knowledge and they told
me that my son deserved to be ﬂogged with one hundred lashes and
exiled for a year, and they informed me that the woman deserved to
be stoned.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “By Him in whose
Hand my self is, I will judge between you by the Book of Allah. As
for your sheep and slave-girl, they should be returned to you. Your
son should have one hundred lashes and be exiled for a year.” He
ordered Unays al-Aslamī to go the wife of the other man and to
stone her if she confessed. She confessed and he stoned her.
7 Mālik related to me from Suhayl ibn Abī Ṣāliḥ from his father

from Abū Hurayra that Sa‘d ibn ‘Ubāda said to the Messenger of
Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “What do you think I should do if I were to ﬁnd a man
with my wife? Should I leave him there until I have brought four
witnesses.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬answered, “Yes.”
8 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Ubaydullāh ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said, “I
heard ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb say, ‘Stoning is in the Book of Allah for
those who commit adultery, men or women, when they are muḥṣan
and when there is clear proof of pregnancy or a confession.’”
9 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sulaymān ibn

Yasār from Abū Wāqid al-Laythī that a man came to ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb while he was in Syria. He mentioned to him that he had
found a man with his wife. ‘Umar sent Abū Wāqid al-Laythī to the
617

wife to question her about that. He came to her while there were
women around her and mentioned to her what her husband had
mentioned to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, and informed her that she
would not be punished on his word and began to suggest to her by
that she should retract her confession. She refused to retract and
held ﬁrm to her confession. ‘Umar gave the order and she was
stoned.
10 Mālik related to me that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard Sa‘īd ibn al-

Musayyab say, “When ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb came from Minā, he
made his camel kneel at al-Abṭaḥ and then he gathered a pile of
small stones and cast his cloak over them and dropped to the
ground. en he raised his hands towards the sky and said, ‘O
Allah! I have become old and my strength has weakened. My ﬂock
is scattered. Take me to You with nothing missed out and without
having neglected anything.’ en he went to Madīna and addressed
the people, saying, ‘People! Sunan have been laid down for you.
Obligations have been placed upon you. You have been left with a
clear way unless you lead people astray right and left.’ He struck one
of his hands on the other and then said, ‘Take care lest you destroy
the āyat of stoning so that someone will say, “We do not ﬁnd two
ḥadds in the Book of Allah.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, stoned, so
we have stoned. By Him in Whose hand my soul is, had it not been
that people would say that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb has added to the
Book of Allah, I would have written it: “e full-grown man and
the full-grown woman, stone them absolutely.” We have certainly
recited that.’”
Mālik said, “ Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said, ‘Dhū
al-Ḥijja had not passed before ‘Umar was murdered, may Allah have
mercy on him.’”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “As for his words, ‘e fullgrown man and the full-grown woman’ he meant, ‘e man and the
woman who have been married, stone them absolutely.’”
M

618

M 11 ālik related to me that he had heard that ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān
was brought a woman to be stoned. ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib said to him,
“She does not deserve that. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in
His Book, ‘His bearing and weaning take thirty months.’ (46:15) and
he said, ‘Mothers should nurse their children for two full years for
those who wish to complete the full term of nursing.’ (2:233)
Pregnancy therefore can be six months, so she does not deserve to
be stoned.” ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān sent for her and found that she had
already been stoned.
Mālik related to me that he asked Ibn Shihāb about someone who
committed sodomy. Ibn Shihāb said, “He is to be stoned, whether
or not he is muḥṣan.”

41.2 Self-confession of fornication
12 Mālik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that a man confessed
to fornication in the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬called for a whip and he was brought a

broken whip. He said, “Better than this,” and he was brought a new
whip whose knots had not been frayed yet. He said, “Not so good as
this,” and he was brought a whip which had been used and was
ﬂexible. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave the order and he was
ﬂogged. en he said, “People! e time has come for you to
observe the limits of Allah. Whoever has had any of these ugly
things befall him should cover them up with the veil of Allah.
Whoever reveals his wrong action to us, we will perform what is in
the Book of Allah against him.”
13 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that Ṣaﬁyya bint Abī ‘Ubayd

informed him that a man who had had intercourse with a virgin
slave-girl and made her pregnant was brought to Abū Bakr aṣṢiddīq. He confessed to fornication and he was not muḥṣan. Abū
Bakr gave the order for him to be ﬂogged with the ḥadd
punishment. en he was banished to Fadak (thirty miles from
Madīna).
619

Mālik spoke about a person who confessed to fornication and then
retracted his confession, saying, “I did not do it. I said that for suchand-such a reason,” and he mentioned the reason. Mālik said, “at
is accepted from him and the ḥadd is not imposed on him. at is
because the ḥadd is what is for Allah and it is only applied by one of
two means, either by clear evidence which establishes guilt or by a
confession which is persisted in so that the ḥadd is imposed. If
someone persists in his confession, the ḥadd is imposed on him.”
Mālik said, “I have not seen the people of knowledge exiling slaves
who have committed adultery.”

41.3 e ḥadd for fornication
14 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Ubaydullāh ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd from Abū Hurayra and Zayd ibn
Khālid al-Juhanī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was asked about a
slave-girl who committed fornication and was not muḥṣana. He
said, “If she commits fornication, then ﬂog her. If she commits
fornication again, then ﬂog her, and if she commits fornication yet
again, then sell her, if only for a rope.”
Ibn Shihāb added, “I do not know whether it was three or four
times.”
15 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that a slave was in charge of the

slaves in the khumus and he forced a slave-girl among those slaves
against her will and had intercourse with her. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
had him ﬂogged and banished him, but he did not ﬂog the slave-girl
because the slave had forced her.
16 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sulaymān ibn

Yasār informed him that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās ibn Abī Rabi‘a alMakhzūmī said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb gave me orders about the
slaves of Quraysh and we ﬂogged some of the slave-girls in the
Muslim lands ﬁfty times for each act of fornication.”

41.4 Rape
620

Mālik said, “e position with us about a woman who is found to be
pregnant and has no husband and she says, ‘I was forced,’ or she
says, ‘I was married,’ is that it is not accepted from her and the ḥadd
is inﬂicted on her unless she has clear evidence of what she claims
about the marriage or being forced or if she comes bleeding if she
was a virgin or she calls out for help so that someone comes to her
and she is in that state or what resembles of it of the situation in
which the violation occurred.” He said, “If she does not produce any
of those, the ḥadd is inﬂicted on her and whatever such claims she
makes are not accepted from her.”
Mālik said, “A raped woman cannot marry until she has proved to
be free of pregnancy by three menstrual periods.”
He said, “If she doubts her periods, she does not marry until she has
freed herself of that doubt.”

41.5 e ḥadd for slander, denial of paternity and insinuation
17 Mālik related to me that Abū az-Zinād said, “‘Umar ibn ‘Abd

al-‘Azīz ﬂogged a slave with eighty lashes for slander.”

Abū az-Zinād said, “I asked ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a about
that and he said, ‘I saw ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān,
the Khalīfas, and so on, and I did not see any of them ﬂog a slave
with more than forty lashes for slander.”
18 Mālik related to me from Zurayq ibn Hakim al-Aylī that a man

called Miṣbaḥ asked his son for help and he thought him
unnecessarily slow. When the son came, his father said to him, “O
fornicator.” Zurayq said, “So the son asked me to help him against
the father. When I wanted to ﬂog him, his son said, ‘By Allah, if
you ﬂog him, I will acknowledge that I have committed fornication.’
When he said that, the situation was unclear for me, so I wrote to
‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz who was the governor at that time and I
mentioned it to him. ‘Umar wrote me to permit his pardon.”

621

Zurayq said, “I also wrote to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz asking, ‘What
do you think about a man who is slandered, or his parents are
slandered, and both or only one of them are dead?’ ‘Umar wrote to
me, ‘If he forgives, his pardon is permitted on his own behalf. If his
parents are slandered and one or both of them are dead, take the
judgement of the Book of Allah for it unless he wants to veil it.’”
Yaḥyā said, “I heard Mālik say, ‘at is because the slandered man
might fear that if it is unveiled about him, a clear proof might be
established. If it is according to what we have described, his pardon
is permitted.”
19 Mālik related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his father said

that there was only one ḥadd against a man who slandered a group
of people.
Mālik said, “If they are on separate occasions there is still only one
ḥadd against him.”
Mālik related to me from Abū ar-Rijāl Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd arRaḥmān ibn Ḥāritha ibn an-Nu‘mān al-Anṣārī, of the Banū anNajjar from his mother, ‘Amra bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān, that two men
cursed each other in the time of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb. One of them
said to the other, “By Allah, my father is not an adulterer and my
mother is not an adulteress.” ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb asked advice
about that. One person said, “He has praised his father and
mother.” Another said, “His father and mother have praise other
than this. We think that he should be ﬂogged with the ḥadd.” So
‘Umar ﬂogged him with the ḥadd of eighty lashes.
Mālik said, “ere is no ḥadd in our view except for slander, denial
of paternity or insinuation in which one sees that what the speaker
intends by that is denial of paternity or slander. en the full ḥadd is
imposed on the one who said that.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community, when a man denies
that another man is his father’s child, is that such a person should
622

receive the ḥadd. If the mother who is the subject of the denial is a
slave, then he should receive the ḥadd as well.”

41.6 at for which there is no ḥadd punishment
Mālik said, “e best of what is heard about a slave-girl with whom
a man has intercourse while he has a partner in her is that the ḥadd
is not inﬂicted on him and the child is connected to him. When the
slave-girl becomes pregnant, her value is estimated and he gives his
partners their shares of the price and the slave-girl is his. at is
what is done among us.”
Mālik, speaking about a man who made his slave-girl lawful to a
man, said that if the said that if the one for whom she was made
lawful had intercourse with her, her value was estimated on the day
he had intercourse with her and he owed that to her owner whether
or not she conceived. e ḥadd punishment was averted from him
by that. If she conceived the child was connected to him.
Mālik said about a man who had intercourse with his son’s or
daughter’s slave-girl, “e ḥadd is averted from him and he owes the
estimated value of the slave-girl whether or not she conceives.”
20 Mālik related to me from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb spoke about a man who went out with his
wife’s slave-girl on a journey and had intercourse with her and then
the wife became jealous and mentioned it to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb.
‘Umar questioned him about it. He said, “She gave her to me.”
‘Umar said, “Bring me clear evidence or I will stone you.”
Rabi‘a added, “e wife admitted that she had given her to him.”

41.7 at which obliges cutting oﬀ the hand
21 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬cut oﬀ the hand of a man who stole a

shield whose price was three dirhams..
623

22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abd arRaḥmān Abū Ḥusayn al-Makkī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“e hand is not cut oﬀ for fruit hanging on the tree and for sheep
kept in the mountains. But when they are taken from the fold or the
place where the fruit is dried, the hand is cut oﬀ for whatever
reaches the price of a shield.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

from his father from ‘Amra bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that a thief stole a
citron in the time of ‘Uthmān. ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān ordered its value
to be estimated and it was estimated at three dirhams at the rate of
exchange of twelve dirhams for the dinar, so ‘Uthmān cut oﬀ his
hand.
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Amra
bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said,

“It has not been a long time for me and I have not forgotten. A
thief ’s hand is cut oﬀ for a quarter of a dinar and upwards.”
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

Ḥāzim that ‘Amra bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān said, “‘Ā’isha, the wife of
the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, went out to Makka with two girl mawlās of hers
and a slave belonging to the sons of ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr aṣṢiddīq. She sent a ﬁgured cloak with the two mawlās which was
sewn up in a piece of green cloth.”

‘Amra continued, “e slave took it and unstitched it and took out
the cloak. In its place he put some felt or skin and sewed it up again.
When the mawlā girls came to Madīna, they gave it to his people.
When they opened it, they found felt in it and did not ﬁnd the
cloak. ey spoke to the two women and they spoke to ‘Ā’isha, the
wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, or they wrote to her, suspecting the slave.
e slave was questioned about it and confessed. Ā’isha, the wife of
the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, gave the order for his hand to be cut oﬀ. Ā’isha said,
“A thief ’s hand is cut oﬀ for a quarter of a dinar and upwards.”

624

Mālik said, “e limit I prefer above which cutting oﬀ the hand is
obliged is three dirhams, whether the exchange is high or low. at
is because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬cut oﬀ the hand of a thief for a
shield whose value was three dirhams, and ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān cut
oﬀ the hand of a thief for a citron which was estimated at three
dirhams. is is what I prefer of what I have heard on the matter.”

41.8 Cutting oﬀ the hands of runaway slaves who steal
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ that a slave of

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar stole while he was a runaway. ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar sent him to Sa‘īd ibn al-‘Āṣ, who was the governor of
Madīna, to cut oﬀ his hand. Sa‘īd refused to cut oﬀ his hand. He
said, “e hand of a runaway slave is not cut oﬀ when he steals.”
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said to him, “In what Book of Allah did you
ﬁnd this?” en ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar gave the order and his hand
was cut oﬀ.
27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Zurayq ibn Ḥakīm informed

him that he had a runaway slave who had stolen. He said, “e
situation was unclear to me, so I wrote to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz to
ask him about it. He was the governor at that time. I informed him
that I had heard that if a runaway slave stole while he was a fugitive,
his hand was not cut oﬀ. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd az-‘Azīz wrote to
contradict what I had said in my letter, ‘You wrote to me that you
have heard that when the runaway slave steals, his hand is not cut
oﬀ. Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in His Book, “As for both
male thieves and female thieves, cut oﬀ their hands in reprisal for
what they have done: an object lesson from Allah. Allah is
Almighty, All-Wise.” (5:41). When his theft reaches a quarter of a
dinar or more, his hand is cut oﬀ.’”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that al-Qāsim
ibn Muḥammad and Sālim ibn ‘Abdullāh and ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr
said, “When a runaway slave steals something for which cutting oﬀ
the hand is obliged, his hand is cut oﬀ.”
625

Mālik said, “e way of doing things amongst us about which there
is no dispute is that when a runaway slave steals what obliges cutting
oﬀ the hand, his hand is cut oﬀ.”

41.9 Intercession is cut oﬀ for thieves when cases reach the ruler
28 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ṣafwān

ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Ṣafwān that it was said to Ṣafwān ibn Umayya,
“Whoever does not make hijra is ruined.” So Ṣafwān ibn Umayya
went to Madīna and slept in the mosque with his cloak as a pillow.
A thief came and took his cloak and Safwān grabbed hold of the
thief and brought him to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. e Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him, “Did you steal this cloak?” He said, “Yes.”
So the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered that his hand be cut oﬀ.
Ṣafwān told him, “I did not intend this. It is his as ṣadaqa. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Why did you not do it before you
brought him to me?”
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān that az-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwām came across a man who had
taken hold of a thief and was intending to take him to the ruler. AzZubayr ibn al-‘Awwām interceded with him to let him go. He said,
“No, not until I take him to the ruler.” Az-Zubayr said, “Once you
reach the ruler with him, Allah curses the one who intercedes and
the one who accepts the intercession.”

41.10 General section on cutting oﬀ the hand
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-

Qāsim from his father that a man from Yemen who had his hand
and foot cut oﬀ presented himself to Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq and
complained to him that the governor of the Yemen had wronged
him, and the man used to pray part of the night. Abū Bakr said, “By
your father, your night is not the night of a thief!” en they missed
the necklace of Asmā’ bint ‘Umays, the wife of Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq.
e man came to go around with them looking for it. He said, “O
Allah, You are responsible for the one who invaded the people of
626

this good house by night!” ey found the jewellery with a
goldsmith who claimed that the maimed man had brought it to
him. e maimed man confessed or there was testimony against
him. Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq ordered that his left hand be cut oﬀ. Abū
Bakr said, “By Allah, his supplication against himself is far more
serious than his theft as far as I am concerned.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “What is done among us, about the
person who steals several times and is then called to reckoning, is
that only his hand is cut oﬀ for all he stole when the ḥadd has not
been applied against him. If the ḥadd has been applied against him
previously and he steals what obliges cutting oﬀ, then the next limb
is cut oﬀ.”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Abū az-Zinād informed

him that a governor of ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz took some people
captive in battle and had not killed any of them. He wanted to cut
oﬀ their hands or kill them, so he wrote to ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz
about that. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz wrote to him, “Better to take
less than that.”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “What is done among us about
a person who steals goods, which people place under guard in the
markets and their owners put them in their containers and store
them together, is that if anyone steals any such thing from where it
is kept, and its value reaches that for which cutting oﬀ the hand is
obliged, his hand must be cut oﬀ, whether or not the owner of the
goods is with his goods and whether it is night or day.”
Mālik, speaking about someone who stole something for which
cutting oﬀ the hand was obliged, and what he stole was found with
him and he returned it to its owner, said, “His hand is cut oﬀ.”
Mālik said, “If someone says, ‘How can his hand be cut oﬀ when
the goods have been taken from him and returned to their owner?’
It is because he is in the same position as the wine drinker when the

627

smell of wine is found on his breath and he is not drunk. He is
ﬂogged with the ḥadd.
He said, “e ḥadd punishment is imposed for drinking wine, even
if it does not make the man intoxicated, because he drank it to
become intoxicated. It is the same situation with cutting oﬀ the
hand of the thief for theft when it is taken from him, even if he has
not proﬁted from it and it has been returned to its owner. When he
stole it, he stole it to take it away.”
Mālik said that if some people came to a house and robbed it
together and then they left with a sack or box or board or basket or
something similar which they carried together, and when they took
it out of its guarded place, they carried it together and the price of
what they took reached what obliged cutting oﬀ the hand, namely
three dirhams or more, each of them had his hand cut oﬀ.
“If each of them takes something by himself, whoever of them takes
out something whose value reaches three dirhams and upwards must
have his hand cut oﬀ. If any of them takes out something whose
value does not reach three dirhams, he does not have his hand cut
oﬀ.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “What is done among us is that when a
man’s house is locked and he is the only one living in it, cutting oﬀ
the hand is not obliged against the one who steals something from
it until he takes it completely out of the house. at is because the
house is a place of custody. If someone other than him lives in the
house and each of them locks his door, and it is a place of custody
for each of them, whoever steals anything from the apartments of
that house must have his hand cut oﬀ when he leaves the apartment
and goes into the main house. He has removed it from its place of
custody to another place and so he must have his hand cut oﬀ.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community, about a slave who
steals from the property of his master, is that if he is not in service
and among those trusted in the house and he enters secretly and
628

steals from his master something for which cutting oﬀ the hand is
obliged, his hand is not cut oﬀ. It is like that with a slave-girl when
she steals from her master’s property. Her hand is not cut oﬀ.”
Mālik then spoke about a slave who was not in service and not one
of those trusted in the house and he entered secretly and stole from
the property of his master’s wife something for which cutting oﬀ the
hand was obliged. He said, “His hand is cut oﬀ.”
“It is like that with the wife’s slave-girl when she does not serve her
or her husband nor is she trusted in the house and she enters
secretly and steals from her mistress’s property something for which
cutting oﬀ the hand is obliged. Her hand is not cut oﬀ.
Mālik said, “Similarly, a woman’s slave-girl who was not in service
to her or her husband and not one of those trusted in the house and
she entered secretly and stole from the property of her mistress’s
husband something for which cutting oﬀ the hand was obliged, her
hand is cut oﬀ.”
“It is like that with the man who steals from his wife’s goods or the
wife who steals from her husband’s goods something for which
cutting oﬀ the hand is obliged. If the thing which one of them steals
from his spouse’s property is in a room other than the room which
they both lock for themselves, or it is in a place of custody in a room
other than the room which they are in, whichever of them steals
something for which cutting oﬀ the hand is obliged, their hand
should be cut oﬀ.”
Mālik spoke about small children and foreigners who do not speak
clearly. He said, “If they are robbed of something from its place of
custody or from under a lock, the one who stole it has his hand cut
oﬀ. If the property is outside its place of custody or locked room
(when it is stolen), the one who robbed them does not have his hand
cut oﬀ. It is then in the same position as sheep stolen from the
mountain and uncut fruit hanging on the trees.”

629

Mālik said, “What is done among us about a person who robs graves
is that if what he takes from the grave reached what obliges cutting
oﬀ the hand, his hand is cut oﬀ. at is because the grave is a place
of custody for what is in it just as houses are a place oﬀ custody for
what is in them.”
Mālik added, “Cutting oﬀ the hand is not obliged until he removes
it from the grave.”

41.11 ings for which the hand is not cut oﬀ
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Muḥammad ibn Yaḥyā ibn Ḥabbān that a slave stole a small palm
from a man’s garden and planted it in his master’s garden. e
owner of the palm went out looking for the palm and found it. He
asked Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam for help against the slave. Marwān
jailed the slave and wanted to cut oﬀ his hand. e master of the
slave rushed oﬀ to Raﬁ‘ ibn Khadīj and asked him about it. Rāﬁ‘
informed him that he heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, “e
hand is not cut oﬀ for fruit or palm pith.” e man said, “Marwān
ibn al-Ḥakam has taken a slave of mine and wants to cut oﬀ his
hand. I would like you to go with me to him so you can tell him
what you heard from the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.” So Rāﬁ‘ went
with him to Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam and said, “Did you arrest a slave
for this?” He replied, “Yes.” He said, “What will you do with him?”
He replied, “I intend to cut oﬀ his hand.” Rāﬁ‘ said to him, “I heard
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘e hand is not cut oﬀ for fruit or
palm pith.’ Marwān therefore ordered that the slave be released.”
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from as-Sā’ib

ibn Yazīd that ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Amr ibn al-Ḥaḍramī brought a slave of
his to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and told him, “Cut oﬀ the hand of this
slave of mine. He has stolen.” ‘Umar asked, “What did he steal?” He
said, “He stole a mirror belonging to my wife. Its value was sixty
dirhams.” ‘Umar said, “Let him go. His hand is not to be cut oﬀ. He
is your servant who has stolen your belongings.”
630

34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Marwān

ibn al-Ḥakam was brought a man who had snatched some goods
and he wanted to cut his hand oﬀ. He sent to Zayd ibn ābit to
ask him about it. Zayd ibn ābit told him, “e hand is not cut oﬀ
for what is stolen by chance, openly, in haste.”

35 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that

Abū Bakr ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm informed him that
he had taken a Nabatean who had stolen some iron rings and jailed
him in order to cut oﬀ his hand. ‘Amra bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān sent a
girl mawlā called Umayya to him. Abū Bakr said that she had come
to him while he was among the people and said that his aunt,
‘Amra, sent word to him saying, “Nephew! You have taken a
Nabatean for something insigniﬁcant which was mentioned to me.
Do you mean to cut oﬀ his hand?” He had replied, “Yes.” She said,
“‘Amra tells you not to cut oﬀ the hand except for a quarter of a
dinar or more.”
Abū Bakr added, “So I let the Nabatean go.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among us
about the confession of slaves is that, if a slave confesses something
against himself, the ḥadd and punishment for it is inﬂicted on his
own person. His confession is accepted from him and one does not
suspect that he would inﬂict something on himself.”
Mālik said, “As for one of them who confesses to a matter which
will incur damages against his master, his confession is not accepted
against his master.”
Mālik said, “One does not cut oﬀ the hand of a hireling, or a man
who is with some people to serve them, if he robs them, because his
state is not the state of a thief. His state is that of a treacherous one.
e treacherous one does not have his hand cut oﬀ.”
Mālik said about a person who borrows something and then denies
it, “His hand is not cut oﬀ. He is like a man who owes a debt to
631

another man and denies it. He does not have his hand cut oﬀ for
what he has denied.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of dealing among us with
the thief who is found in a house and has gathered up goods and has
not taken them out is that his hand is not cut oﬀ. at is like the
man who places wine before him to drink and does not drink it. e
ḥadd is not imposed on him. at is like a man who sits with a
woman and desires to have unlawful intercourse with her and does
not do it and he does not reach her. ere is no ḥadd against that
either.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things among us
is that there is no cutting oﬀ the hand for what is taken by chance,
openly and in haste, whether or not its price reaches that for which
the hand is cut oﬀ.”

632

42. Drinks
42.1 e ḥadd punishment for drinking wine
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that as-Sā’ib ibn

Yazīd informed him that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb came out to them.
He said, “I have found the smell of wine on so-and-so and he claims
that it was the drink of boiled fruit juice. I am inquiring about what
he has drunk. If it intoxicates, I will ﬂog him.” ‘Umar then ﬂogged
him with the full ḥadd.
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from awr ibn Zayd ad-Dīlī that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb asked advice about a man drinking wine. ‘Alī
ibn Abī Ṭālib said to him, “We think that you should ﬂog him for it
with eighty lashes, because when he drinks, he becomes intoxicated,
and when he becomes intoxicated, he talks confusedly, and when he
talks confusedly he tells lies.” (Eighty Lashes is the same amount as
for slander). ‘Umar imposed eighty lashes for drinking wine.
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that he was

asked about the ḥadd imposed on a slave for drinking wine. He said,
“I heard that he receives half the ḥadd of a free man for drinking
wine. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān and ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar ﬂogged their slaves with half of the ḥadd of a free man when
they drank wine.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that he

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, “ere is nothing that Allah does
not like to be pardoned as long as it is not a ḥadd.”

Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e sunna with us is that the ḥadd is
imposed against anyone who drinks something intoxicating,
whether or not he becomes drunk.”

42.2 Containers forbidden for preparation of nabīdh
633

5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬addressed the people on one

of his raids. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “I went towards him, but he
ﬁnished before I reached him. I asked about what he had said.
Someone said to me, ‘He forbade preparing nabīdh in a gourd or in
a jug smeared with pitch.’”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from al-‘Alā’ ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān

ibn Ya‘qūb from his father from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade preparing nabīdh in a gourd or in a jug smeared
with pitch.

42.3 Mixtures of fruit disapproved for making nabīdh
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade preparing nabīdh

from nearly ripe dates and fresh dates together, and from dates and
raisins together.

8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from a reliable source from

Bukayr ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn al-Ashajj from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn alḤubāb al-Anṣārī from Abū Qatāda al-Anṣārī that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade making nabīdh from dates and raisins together,
and nearly ripe dates and fresh dates together.

Mālik said, “at is the way of doing things among us which the
people of knowledge in our city continue to observe. It is
disapproved of because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade it.”

42.4 e prohibition of wine
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū
Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahmān that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬
said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was asked about mead and he

replied, ‘Every drink which intoxicates is unlawful.’”

10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was asked about al-

634

ghubayrā’. He said, “ere is no good in it,” and forbade it.
Mālik said, “I asked Zayd ibn Aslam, ‘What is al-ghubayrā’?’ He
replied, ‘It is an intoxicant.’”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If someone drinks wine

in this world and does not turn from it in repentance, it will be
unlawful for him in the Next World.”

42.5 General section on the prohibition of wine
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that Ibn

Wa‘lā al-Miṣrī asked ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās about what is squeezed
from grapes. Ibn ‘Abbās replied, “A man gave the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬a small water-skin of wine. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said
to him, ‘Do you not know that Allah has made it unlawful?’ He
answered, ‘No.’ en a man at his side whispered to him. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked what he had whispered and the man
replied, ‘I told him to sell it.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫‘ ﷺ‬e One
who made drinking it unlawful has made selling it unlawful.’ e
man then opened the water-skins and poured out what was in
them.”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn

Abī Ṭalḥa that Anas ibn Mālik said, “I was serving wine to Abū
‘Ubayda ibn al-Jarraḥ, Abū Ṭalḥa al-Anṣārī and Ubayy ibn Ka‘b.
e wine had been prepared from crushed ripe dates and dried
dates. Someone came to them and said, ‘Wine has been made
unlawful.’ Abū Ṭalḥa ordered me to go and take the jugs and break
them. I stood up and went over and got a mortar of ours and I
struck them with the bottom of it until they broke.”
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwud ibn al-Ḥusayn that

Wāqid ibn ‘Amr ibn Sa‘d ibn Mu‘ādh informed him from Maḥmūd
ibn Labīd al-Anṣārī that when ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb went to Syria,
some Syrians complained to him about the bad climate of their
635

country and its heaviness. ey said, “Only this drink helps.” ‘Umar
said, “Drink this honey preparation.” ey said, “Honey does not
help us.” A man from the people of that land said, “Can we give you
something of this drink which does not intoxicate?” He said, “Yes.”
ey cooked it until two-thirds of it had evaporated and one-third
of it remained. en they brought it to ‘Umar who put his ﬁnger in
it and then raised his head and extended it. He said, “is is fruit
juice concentrated by boiling. is is like the distillation which you
smear on camel’s scabs.” ‘Umar ordered them to drink it. ‘Ubāda ibn
aṣ-Ṣāmit said to him, “You have made it lawful, by Allah!” ‘Umar
said, “No, by Allah! O Allah, I will not make anything lawful for
them which You have made lawful for them! I will not make
anything unlawful for them which You have made lawful for them!”
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar that some men from Iraq said to him, “Abū ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān,
we buy the fruit of the palm and grapes and we squeeze them into
wine and sell it.” ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “I call on Allah and His
angels and whatever jinn and men hear to testify to you that I order
you not to buy it nor sell it nor press it nor to drink it nor to give it
to people to drink. It is something impure from the work of
Shayṭān.”

636

43. Blood Money
43.1 Concerning blood-money
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr ibn

Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm from his father that in a letter
which the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent to ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm about
blood-money, he wrote that it was one hundred camels for a life,
one hundred camels for a nose if completely removed, a third of the
blood-money for a wound in the brain, the same as that for a belly
wound, ﬁfty for an eye, ﬁfty for a hand, ﬁfty for a foot, ten camels
for each ﬁnger, and ﬁve for teeth, and ﬁve for a head wound which
laid the bone bare.

43.2 Procedure in blood-money
2 Mālik related to me that he had heard that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb

estimated the full blood-money for the people of urban areas. For
those who had gold, he made it one thousand dinars, and for those
who had silver, he made it ten thousand dirhams.
Mālik said, “e people of gold are the people of Syria and the
people of Egypt. e people of silver are the people of Iraq.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that the blood-money
was divided into instalments over three or four years.
Mālik said, “ree years is the most preferable to me of what I have
heard on that.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our
community is that camels are not accepted from the people of cities
for blood-money nor is gold or silver accepted from desert people.
Silver is not accepted from the people of gold and gold is not
accepted from the people of silver.”



637

43.3 e blood-money for murder when accepted, and the
criminal act of the insane
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “e full
blood-money for murder, when it is accepted, is twenty-ﬁve
yearlings, twenty-ﬁve two year olds, twenty-ﬁve four year olds, and
twenty-ﬁve ﬁve year olds.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that

Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam wrote to Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān that a
madman was brought to him who had killed a man. Mu‘āwiya wrote
to him, “Tie him up and do not inﬂict any retaliation on him. ere
is no retaliation against a madman.”
Mālik said about an adult and a child when they murder a man
together: “e adult is killed and the child pays half the full bloodmoney.”
Mālik said, “It is like that with a free man and a slave when they
murder a slave. e slave is killed and the free man pays half of his
value.”

43.4 e blood-money for manslaughter
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Irāk ibn

Mālik and Sulaymān ibn Yasār that a man of the Banū Sa‘d ibn
Layth was running a horse and it trod on the ﬁnger of a man from
the Juhayna tribe. It bled profusely and he died. ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb said to those against whom the claim was made, “Do you
swear by Allah with ﬁfty oaths that he did not die of it?” ey
refused and refrained from doing it. He said to the others, “Will
you take an oath?” ey refused, so ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb gave a
judgement that the Banū Sa‘d had to pay half the full blood-money.
Mālik said, “One does not act on this.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb, Sulaymān ibn
Yasār, and Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān said, “e blood money
638

for manslaughter is twenty yearlings, twenty two-year olds, twenty
male two-year olds, twenty four-year olds and twenty-ﬁve-year
olds.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way with us is that there is no
retaliation carried out against children. eir intention is accidental.
e ḥudūd penalties are not obliged for them if they have not yet
reached puberty. If a child kills someone it is only accidentally. Had
a child and an adult killed a free man accidentally, each of them
would pay half the blood-money.”
Mālik said, “A person who kills someone accidentally pays bloodmoney with his property and there is no retaliation carried out
against him. at money is like anything else from the dead man’s
property and his debt is paid with it and he is allowed to make a
bequest from it. If he has a total property of which the blood-money
is a third and then the blood-money is relinquished, that is
permitted to him. If all the property he has is his blood-money, he is
permitted to relinquish a third of it and to make that a bequest.”

43.5 e blood-money for accidental injury
Mālik related to me that the generally agreed on way of doing
things amongst the community in the event of an accident is that
there is no blood-money paid until the victim is better. If a man’s
bone, either a hand, or a foot, or another part of his body, is broken
accidentally and it heals and becomes sound and returns to its
proper form, there is no blood-money for it. If the limb is impaired
or there is a scar on it, there is blood-money for it according to the
extent that it is impaired.
Mālik said, “If that part of the body has a amount of speciﬁc bloodmoney mentioned by the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, it is according to what the
Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬speciﬁed. If it is something that does not have a speciﬁc
blood-money mentioned by the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and there is no previous
sunna about it or speciﬁc blood-money, one uses ijtihād about it.”

639

Mālik said, “ere is no blood-money for an accidental bodily injury
when the wound heals and it returns to its proper form. If there is
any scar or mark, ijtihād is used about it except for the belly-wound.
ere is a third of the blood-money of a life for it.”
Mālik said, “ere is no blood-money for the wound which splinters
bone in the body, which is like the wound to the body which lays
bare the bone.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our
community is that when the doctor performs a circumcision and
cuts oﬀ the glans, he must pay the blood-money. at is because it is
an accident which the tribe is responsible for, and the full bloodmoney is payable for everything in which a doctor errs or exceeds,
when it is not intentional.”

43.6 e blood-money for women
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab said, “e blood-money for a woman is the same as for
a man up to one-third of the blood-money. Her ﬁnger is like his
ﬁnger, her tooth is like his tooth, her injury which lays the bone is
like his, and her head wound which splinters the bone is like his.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb and also ‘Urwa ibn
az-Zubayr said the same as Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said about a
woman. Her blood-money from a man is the same up to a third of
the blood-money of a man. If what she is owed exceeds a third of
the blood-money of the man, she is given up to half of the bloodmoney of a man.
Mālik said, “e explanation of that is that she receives bloodmoney for a head wound that lays bare the bone and for a wound
that splinters the bone and for what is less than the brain wound
and the belly and any such wounds which oblige a third of the
blood-money or more. If the amount owed her exceeds that, her
blood-money for that is half of the full blood-money of a man.”
640

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard Ibn Shihāb say, “e
precedent of the sunna when a man injures a woman is that he must
pay the blood-money for that injury and there is no retaliation
carried out against him.”
Mālik said, “at is accidental injury, as when a man strikes a
woman and the blow lands where he did not intend: for instance, if
he struck her with a whip and cut her eye open and things like that.”
Mālik, speaking about a woman who has a husband and children
who are not from her paternal relatives or her people, said that since
he is from another tribe there is no blood-money against her
husband for her criminal action, nor against any of her children if
they are not from her people, nor against her maternal brothers
when they are not from her paternal relations or her people. ese
are entitled to her inheritance but only the paternal relations have
paid blood-money since the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.
Until today it is like that with the mawlā of a woman. e
inheritance they leave goes to the children of the woman even if
they are not from her tribe, but the blood-money of the criminal act
of the mawlā is only against her tribe.”

43.7 e blood-money for the foetus
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Abū

Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf from Abū Hurayra that a
woman of the Hudhayl tribe threw a stone at a woman from the
same tribe who then had a miscarriage. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
gave a judgement that a slave or a slave-girl of fair complexion and
excellence should be given to her.
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave a judgement that

the compensation for a foetus killed in its mother’s womb was a
slave or a slave-girl of fair complexion and excellence. e one
against whom the judgement was given said, “Why should I pay
damages for that which did not drink or eat or speak or make any
641

cry? e like of that is nothing.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“is is only one of the brothers of the diviners.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd arRaḥmān said, “e slave of fair complexion and excellence is
estimated at ﬁfty dinars or six hundred dirhams. e blood-money
of a free Muslim woman is ﬁve hundred dinars or six thousand
dirhams.”
Mālik said, “e blood-money of the foetus of a free woman is a
tenth of her blood-money. e tenth is ﬁfty dinars or six hundred
dirhams.”
Mālik said, “I have not heard anyone dispute that there is no slave in
compensation for the foetus until it leaves its mother’s womb and
falls stillborn from her womb.”
Mālik said, “I heard that if the foetus comes out of its mother’s
womb alive and then dies, the full blood-money is due for it.”
Mālik said, “e foetus is not alive unless it cries at birth. If it
comes out of its mother’s womb and cries out and then dies, the
complete blood-money is due for it. We think that the slave-girl’s
foetus has a tenth of the price of the slave-girl.”
Mālik said, “When a woman murders a man or woman, and the
murderess is pregnant, retaliation is not taken against her until she
has given birth. If a woman who is pregnant is killed intentionally or
unintentionally, the one who killed her is not obliged to pay
anything for her foetus. If she is murdered, then the one who killed
her is killed and there is no blood-money for her foetus. If she is
killed accidentally, the tribe obliged to pay on behalf of her killer
pays her blood-money, and there is no blood-money for the foetus.”
Yaḥyā related to me, “Mālik was asked about the foetus of a
Christian or Jewish woman which was aborted. He said, “I think
that there is a tenth of the blood-money of the mother for it.”
642

43.8 Injuries for which there is full blood-money
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab used to say, “e full blood-money is payable for cutting
oﬀ both lips, but when the lower one only is cut oﬀ, two-thirds of
the blood-money is due for it.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he asked Ibn Shihāb what
happened if a one-eyed man gouged out the eye of a healthy person.
Ibn Shihāb said, “If the healthy person wants to take retaliation
from him, he can have his retaliation. If he prefers, he has bloodmoney of one thousand dinars, twelve thousand dirhams.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that full blood-money
is payable for both of a pair of any parts of a man that occur in pairs,
and the tongue incurs full blood-money. e ears, when their
hearing has departed, incur full blood-money, whether or not they
have been cut oﬀ, and a man’s penis incurs full blood-money as do
testicles.
Yaḥyā related from Mālik that he heard that the breasts of a woman
incurred full blood-money.
Mālik said, “e least of that are the eyebrows and a man’s breasts.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community when a man is injured
in his extremities to an extent that obliges payment of more than the
amount of his full blood-money, is that he has a right to it. If his
hands, feet and eyes are all injured, he has three full blood-moneys.”
Mālik said about the sound eye of a one-eyed man when it is
accidentally gouged out, “e full blood-money is payable for it.”

43.9 e blood-money for an eye whose sight is lost
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from
Sulaymān ibn Yasār that Zayd ibn ābit used to say, “When the

643

eye remains but the sight is lost, one hundred dinars are payable for
it.”
Yaḥyā said, “Mālik was asked about cutting oﬀ the lower lid of the
eye and the bone around the eye. He said, ‘ere is only ijtihād
about that unless the vision of the eye is impaired. He is entitled to
an amount that is compatible to the extent that the vision of the eye
has been impaired.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “What is done in our community about
removing the bad eye of a one-eyed man when it has already been
blinded and still remains there in its place and the paralyzed hand
when it is cut oﬀ is that ijtihād in that must be used. ere is no
prescribed blood-money.”

43.10 e blood-money for head wounds
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard
Sulaymān ibn Yasār mention that a face wound in which the bone
was bared was like a head wound in which the bone was bared
unless the face was scarred by the wound. en the blood-money
was increased by one half of the blood-money of a head wound in
which the skin was bared so that seventy-ﬁve dinars are payable for
it.
Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that a head wound
with splinters gets ﬁfteen camels.”
He explained, “e head wound with splinters is a wound from
which pieces of bone ﬂy oﬀ but which does not reach the brain. It
can be in the head or the face.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our
community is that there is no retaliation for a wound to the brain or
a belly wound, and Ibn Shihāb has said, ‘ere is no retaliation for a
wound to the brain.’”

644

Mālik explained, “e wound to the brain is a wound which pierces
the skull through to the brain. is type of wound only occurs in the
head. It is one that reaches the brain when the skull is pierced.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that there is no
blood-money paid on any head wound less than one which lays bare
the skull. Blood-money is payable only for a head wound that bares
the bone and anything more severe than that. at is because the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stopped at the head wound which bared the
bone in his letter to ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm. He made the blood-money for
it ﬁve camels. e imāms, past and present, have not made any
blood-money payable for injuries less than the head wound which
bares the bone.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab said, “For every piercing wound in any of the organs or
limbs of the body, one third of the blood-money of that limb is
payable.”
Mālik related to me, “Ibn Shihāb did not think, and nor do I, that
there is a generally agreed on way of doing things regarding a
piercing wound in any of the organs or limbs of the body, but I
think that ijtihād should be used in each case. e imām uses ijtihād
about it, and there is no generally agreed on way of doing things in
our community in this case.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community about a brain wound
and a wound which splinters the bone and a wound that bares the
bone is that they apply to the head and face. If such a wound occurs
in the body it is subject to ijtihād.”
Mālik said, “I do not think the lower jaw or the nose are part of the
head in regard to injury because they are separate bones, and apart
from them the head is made up of a single bone.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd arRaḥmān that ‘Abdullāh ibn az-Zubayr allowed retaliation for a head
645

wound which splintered the bone.

43.11 e blood-money for ﬁngers
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Rabi‘a ibn Abī ‘Abd arRaḥmān said, “I asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab, ‘How much is it for
the ﬁnger of a woman?’ He replied, ‘Ten camels.’ I said, ‘How much
for two ﬁngers?’ He said, ‘Twenty camels.’ I asked, ‘How much for
three?’ He said, ‘irty camels.’ I said, ‘How much for four?’ He
said, ‘Twenty camels.’ I said, ‘When her wound is greater and her
aﬄiction stronger is her blood-money then less?’ He asked, ‘Are you
an Iraqi then?’ I said, ‘Rather I am a scholar who seeks to verify
things, or an ignorant man who seeks to learn.’ Sa‘īd said, ‘It is the
sunna, my nephew.’”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community about all the ﬁngers of
the hand being cut oﬀ is that complete blood-money is given. at
is because when ﬁve ﬁngers are cut, their blood-money is the bloodmoney of the hand: ﬁfty camels. Each ﬁnger has ten camels.”
Mālik said, “e reckoning of the ﬁngers is thirty-three dinars for
each ﬁngertip, and that is three and a third shares of camels.”

43.12 General section on the blood-money for teeth
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from

Muslim ibn Jundub from Aslam, the mawlā of ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb, that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb decided that there was a camel
for a molar, a camel for a collar-bone, and a camel for a rib.
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd heard Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab say, “’Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb decided on a camel for each
molar, and Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān decided on ﬁve camels for each
molar.”
Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab said, “e blood-money is less in the
judgement of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and more in the judgement of
Mu‘āwiya. If it had been me, I would have made it two camels for
646

each molar. at is the fair blood-money, and everyone who strives
with ijtihād is rewarded.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab used to say, “When a tooth is struck and becomes
black, there is complete blood-money for it. If it falls out after it
becomes black, there is also the complete blood-money for it.”

43.13 Procedure in the blood-money for teeth
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Dāwūd ibn al-Ḥusayn that

Abū Ghaṭafān ibn Ṭarīf al-Murrī informed him that Marwān ibn
al-Ḥakam sent him to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās to ask him what there
was for the molar. ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās said, “ere are ﬁve camels
for it.” He said, “Marwān sent me back again to ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Abbās.” He said, “Do you consider all teeth as molars?” ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Abbās said, “It is enough that you take the ﬁngers as the
example for that, their blood-money being all the same.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his
father made all the teeth the same with respect to the blood-money
and did not prefer any kind over others.
Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that the front teeth,
molars, and eye-teeth have the same blood-money. at is because
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘e tooth has ﬁve camels.’ e
molar is one of the teeth and he did not prefer any kind over the
others.”

43.14 e blood-money for injuries to slaves
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab and Sulaymān ibn Yasār said, “e head wound of a slave
in which the bone is bared is a twentieth of his price.”

647

Mālik related to me that he had heard that Marwān ibn al-Ḥakam
gave a decision that when a slave was injured, the person who
injured him had to pay the amount that the value of the slave had
diminished due to the injury.
Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that for the head
wound of a slave that bares the bone there is a twentieth of his price.
e head wound which splinters the bone incurs three-twentieths of
his price. Both the wound to the brain and the belly-wound incur a
third of his price. Besides these four, any other types of injury that
decrease the value of the slave are considered after the slave is better
and well, and one sees what the value of the slave is after his injury
and what his value whole was before he received the injury. en the
one who injured him pays the diﬀerence between the two values.”

43.15 e blood-money of the People of Protection (dhimma)
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd
al-‘Azīz gave a decision that when a Jew or Christian was killed, his
blood-money was half the blood-money of a free Muslim.
Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that a Muslim is not
killed in retaliation for the death of an unbeliever unless the Muslim
killed him by treachery. In such a case he is killed for it.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that
Sulaymān ibn Yasār said, “e blood-money of a Magian is eight
hundred dirhams.”
Mālik said, “is is what is done in our community.”
Mālik said, “e blood money for injuries suﬀered by Jews,
Christians and Magians is the same as for injuries to the Muslims.
e head wound incurs a twentieth of the full blood-money. e
wound that opens the head incurs a third. e belly-wound also
incurs a third of his blood-money. All their injuries are assessed in
this way.”
648

43.16 Blood-money that has to be paid on an individual basis
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his
father said, “e tribe is not obliged to pay blood-money for
intentional murder. ey only pay blood-money for accidental
killing.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ibn Shihāb said, “e
precedent in the sunna is that the tribe is not liable for any bloodmoney of an intentional killing unless they wish it to be.”
Yaḥyā related the same as that to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn
Sa‘īd.
Mālik said that Ibn Shihāb said, “e precedent in the sunna in the
case of intentional murder is that when the relatives of the murdered
person relinquish their right of retaliation, the blood-money is owed
by the murderer from his own property unless the tribe helps him
with it willingly.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that the bloodmoney is not taken from the tribe until it has reached a third of the
full amount and upwards. If it reaches a third is it is owed by the
tribe, and if it is below a third it is taken from the property of the
one who inﬂicted the injury.”
Mālik said, “e way of doing things about which there is no
dispute among us in the case of someone who has the blood-money
accepted from him in intentional murder, or in any injury in which
there is retaliation, is that the blood-money is not due from the
tribe unless they wish it. e blood-money for it comes from the
property of the murderer or the injurer if he has property. If he does
not have any property it is a debt against him, and none of it is owed
by the tribe unless they wish it to be.”
Mālik said, “e tribe does not pay blood-money to anyone who
injures himself, intentionally or accidentally. is is the opinion of
the people of ﬁqh in our community. I have not heard that anyone
649

has made the tribe liable for blood-money incurred by intentional
actions. Well-known evidence for that is that Allah, the Blessed, the
Exalted, said in His Book, ‘But if someone is absolved by his
brother, blood-money should be claimed with correctness and paid
with good will.’ (2:178). e commentary on that, in our view, and
Allah knows best, is that whoever gives his brother something of the
blood-money should follow it with what is accepted and pay him
with good will.”
Mālik spoke about a child who had no property and a woman who
had no property. He said, “When one of them causes an injury
incurring below a third of the total blood-money, it is taken on
behalf of the child and woman from their personal property, if they
have property from which it may be taken. If not, the injury which
each of them has caused is a debt against them. eir tribe does not
have to pay any of it, and the father of a child is not liable for the
blood-money for an injury caused by his child and he is not
responsible for it.”
Mālik said, “e way of doing things in our community about
which there is no dispute is that when a slave is killed, his value is
the same as it was on the day on which he was killed. e tribe of
the murderer is not liable for any of the slave’s value, great or small.
It is the responsibility of the one who killed him and must be paid
from his own personal property as far as it covers it. If the value of
the slave is the same as the blood-money or even more, that must be
paid from his property. at is because the slaves are a category of
goods.”

43.17 Inheritance of blood-money and making it more severe
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that ‘Umar ibn

al-Khaṭṭāb demanded of the people at Minā, “If anyone has
knowledge of blood-money, let him tell me.” Aḍ-Ḍaḥḥāk ibn Sufyān
al-Kilābī stood up and said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬wrote to
me that the wife of Ashyam aḍ-Ḍibābī inherited from the bloodmoney of her husband.” ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said to him, “Go into
650

the tent until I come to you.” When ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb came in,
aḍ-Ḍaḥḥāk told him about it and ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb gave a
decision based on that.
Ibn Shihāb added, “e killing of Ashyam was accidental.”
10 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb

that a man of the Banū Mudlij called Qatāda threw a sword at his
son and it struck his thigh. e wound bled profusely and he died.
Suraqa ibn Ju‘shum came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb and mentioned
that to him. ‘Umar told him, “At the watering-place of Qudayd
count one hundred and twenty camels and wait until I come to you.”
When ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb came to him, he took thirty four-year
old camels, thirty ﬁve-year old camels and forty pregnant camels
from them. en he said, “Where is the brother of the slain man?”
He said, “Here.” He said, “Take them. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘e killer gets nothing.’”
Mālik said that he had heard that Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab and
Sulaymān ibn Yasār were asked, “Does one make the blood-money
more severe in the sacred month?” ey replied, “No. But it is
increased because of violating the month.” Sa‘īd was asked, “Does
one impose an increase for a wound just as one increases for a life?”
He replied, “Yes.”
Mālik added, “I think that they meant the same as ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb did with respect to the blood-money of the Mudlijī when
he struck his son (i.e. giving one hundred and twenty camels instead
of a hundred.)”
11 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Urwa ibn az-

Zubayr that a man of the Anṣār called Uḥayḥa ibn al-Julāḥ had a
young paternal uncle who was younger than him and who was living
with his maternal uncles. Uḥayḥa seized him and killed him. His
maternal uncles said, “We brought him up from a baby to a youth
till he stood ﬁrm on his feet, and we have had the right of a man

651

taken from us by his paternal uncle.” ‘Urwa said, “For that reason a
killer does not inherit from the one he killed.”
Mālik said, “e way of doing things about which there is no
dispute is that the intentional murderer does not inherit any of the
blood-money of the person he has murdered nor any of his property.
He does not stop anyone who has a share of inheritance from
inheriting. e one who kills accidentally does not inherit any of the
blood-money and there is dispute as to whether or not he inherits
from the dead person’s property, because there is no suspicion that
he killed him for his inheritance and in order to take his property. I
prefer that he inherit from the dead person’s property and not
inherit from the blood-money.”

43.18 General section on blood-money
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn

al-Musayyab and Abū Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e wound of an
animal is of no account and no compensation is due for it. e well
is of no account and no compensation is due for it. e mine is of
no account and no compensation is due for it and a ﬁfth is due for
buried treasure.” Mālik said, “at which is of no account is that for
which there is no blood-money.”
Mālik said, “Everyone leading an animal by the halter, driving it or
riding it is responsible if the animal kicks out without anything
being done to make it kick out. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb imposed the
blood-money on a person who was exercising his horse.”
Mālik commented, “It is yet more ﬁtting that a person who is
leading an animal by the halter, driving it or riding it incur a loss
than a person who is exercising his horse.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community about a person who
digs a well on a road or ties up an animal or does something similar
on a road used by Muslims is that, since what he has done is
652

included among the things which he is not permitted to do in such
a place, he is liable for whatever injury or other thing arises from
that action. e blood-money for anything less than a third of the
full blood-money is owed from his personal property. Whatever
reaches a third or more is owed by his tribe. Anything that he does
which he is permitted to do on the Muslims’ roads is something for
which he has no liability or loss. Such things include a hole which a
man digs to collect rain, and a beast from which the man alights for
some need and leaves standing on the road. ere is no penalty
against anyone for such as this.”
Mālik spoke about a man who went down a well with another man
following behind him. e lower one pulled the higher one, and
they both fell into the well and died. He said, “e tribe of the one
who pulled the other in is responsible for the blood-money.”
Mālik spoke about a child whom a man ordered to go down a well
or to climb a palm tree and he died as a result. He said, “e one
who ordered him is liable for whatever befalls him, be it death or
anything else.”
Mālik said, “e way of doing things in our community about
which there is no dispute is that women and children are not
obliged to pay blood-money together with the tribe with respect to
any blood-money which the tribe must pay. e blood-money is
only obligatory for men who have reached puberty.”
Mālik said that the tribe could bind themselves to the blood-money
of mawālī if they wished. If they refused, they were people of the
Dīwān or were cut oﬀ from their people. In the time of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬people paid the blood-money to each other,
as well as in the time of Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq, before there was a
Dīwān. e Dīwān came about in the time of ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb.
No one other than one’s people and the ones holding the walā’ paid
blood-money for someone, because the walā’ was not transferable
and because the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “e walā’ belongs to the one who
sets free.”
653

Mālik commented, “e walā’ is an established relationship.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community about animals that are
injured is that the person who causes the injury pays the amount
that their value has been diminished.”
Mālik said about a man condemned to death who becomes liable for
one of the other ḥudūd as well, “He is not punished for it. at is
because killing overrides everything, except for slander. Slander
remains hanging over the one to whom it was said because it will be
said to him, ‘Why do you not ﬂog the one who slandered you?’ I
think that a condemned man is ﬂogged with the ḥadd before he is
killed, and then he is killed. I do not think that any retaliation is
inﬂicted on him for any injury except killing because killing
overrides everything else.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that when a
murdered person is found among the main body of a people in a
village or other place, the people of the nearest house or place to
him are not held responsible. at is because the murdered person
can be slain and then cast at the door of some people to shame them
by it. No one is responsible for something like that.”
Mālik said about a group of people who ﬁght with each other and
when the ﬁght is broken up, a man is found dead or wounded, and
it is not known who did it, “e best of what is heard about that is
that there is blood-money for him, and the blood-money is against
the people who argued with him. If the injured or slain person is not
from either of the two parties, his blood-money is against both of
the two parties together.”

43.19 Killing secretly by trickery and sorcery
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘īd

ibn al-Musayyab that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb killed ﬁve or seven
people for one man whom they had killed secretly by trickery. ‘Umar

654

said, “Had all the people of San‘a joined forces against him, I would
have killed all of them.”
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān ibn Sa‘d ibn Zurara that he had heard that Ḥafṣa, the wife
of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬killed one of her slave-girls who had used sorcery
against her. e girl was a mudabbara. Ḥafṣa gave the order and she
was killed.
Mālik commented, “e sorcerer is the one who uses sorcery on his
own account, not someone who has it done for him. It is like the
one about whom Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, said in His Book,
‘ey know that any who deal in it will have no share in the Next
World.’ (2:102) I think that if someone practises it, he should be
killed.”

43.20 What is obligatory for intentional injury
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Umar ibn Ḥusayn, the

mawlā of ‘Ā’isha bint Qudāma, that ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwān
imposed retaliation against a man who killed a mawlā with a stick –
and so the mawlā’s patron killed the man with a stick.
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our
community about which there is no dispute is that when a man
strikes another man with a stick or hits him with a rock or
intentionally strikes him causing his death, that is an intentional
injury and there is retaliation for it.”
Mālik said, “Intentional murder in our opinion is that a man
intentionally goes to a man and strikes him until his life departs.
Part of intentional injury also is that a man strikes a man in a
quarrel between them. He leaves him while he is alive and then he
bleeds to death and so dies. ere is retaliation for that.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community is that a group of free
men are killed for the intentional murder of one free man, and a
655

group of women for one woman, and a group of slaves for one
slave.”

43.21 Retaliation in killing
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Marwān ibn
al-Ḥakam wrote to Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān to mention to him
that a drunkard had been brought to him who had killed a man.
Mu‘āwiya wrote to him to kill him in retaliation for the dead man.
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e best of what I have heard about the
interpretation of this āyat, the words of Allah, the Blessed, the
Exalted, ‘e free man for the free man and the slave for the slave’ –
these are men – ‘and the female for the female’ (2:178), is that
retaliation is between women as it is between men. e free woman
is killed for the free woman as the free man is killed for the free
man. Slave-girls are slain for slave-girls as the slave is slain for the
slave. Retaliation is between women as it is between men. at is
because Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, says in His Book, ‘We
prescribed for them in it: is a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose
for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and
retaliation for wounds.’ (5:45). Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted,
mentioned that it is a life for a life. It is the life of a free woman for
the life of a free man, and her injury for his injury.”
Mālik said about a man who held a man fast so that another man
could hit him, and he died on the spot, “If he held him and he
thought that he meant to kill him, the two of them are both killed
for him. If he held him thinking that he meant to hit him as people
sometimes do, and he did not think that he meant to kill him, the
murderer is slain and the one who held the victim is punished
severely and jailed for a year. ere is no right to kill him.”
Mālik said about a man who murdered a man intentionally or
gouged out his eye intentionally, and then was slain or had his eye
gouged out himself before retaliation was inﬂicted on him, “ere is
no blood-money nor retaliation against him. e right of the one
656

who was killed or had his eye gouged out goes when the thing
which he is claiming as retaliation goes. It is the same with a man
who murders another man intentionally and then the murderer dies.
When the murderer dies, the one seeking blood revenge has no
blood-money or anything else. at is by the word of Allah, the
Blessed, the Exalted, ‘Retaliation is prescribed for you in the case of
people killed: free man for free man and slave for slave.’ (2:178)
Mālik said, “He only has retaliation against the one who killed him.
If the man who murdered him dies, he has no right to retaliation or
blood-money.”
Mālik said, “ere is no retaliation against a free man by a slave for
any injury. e slave is killed for the free man but the free man is
not slain for the slave, even if he murders him intentionally. is is
the best of what I have heard.”

43.22 Pardoning murder
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that those he was satisﬁed with
among the people of knowledge said about a man who willed that
his murderer be pardoned when he had murdered him intentionally,
“at is permitted for him. He is more entitled to the man’s blood
than any of his relatives after him.”
Mālik said about a man who pardoned murder after having
previously claimed his right and it was obliged for him to be paid,
“ere is no blood-money against the murderer unless the one who
pardons him actually stipulates that when he pardons him.”
Mālik said about a murderer when he was pardoned, “He is ﬂogged
one hundred lashes and jailed for a year.”
Mālik said, “When a man murders intentionally and there is a clear
proof of that, and the murdered man has sons and daughters and the
sons pardon and the daughters refuse to pardon, the pardon of the
sons is permitted in opposition to the daughters and the daughters
657

have no authority over the sons in demanding blood and
pardoning.”

43.23 Retaliation in Injury
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing
things in our community is that retaliation is taken from someone
who breaks someone’s hand or foot intentionally, and not bloodmoney.”
Mālik said, “Retaliation is not inﬂicted on anyone until the wound
of the injured party has healed. en retaliation is inﬂicted on him.
If the wound of the person on whom the retaliation has been
inﬂicted is like the ﬁrst person’s wound when it heals, it is
retaliation. If the wound of the one on whom the retaliation has
been inﬂicted becomes worse or he dies, there is nothing held
against the one who has taken retaliation. If the wound of the
person on whom the retaliation has been inﬂicted heals and the
injured party is paralysed or his injury has healed but he has a scar,
defect or blemish, the person on whom the retaliation has been
inﬂicted does not have his hand broken again and further retaliation
is not taken for his injury.”
He also said, “But there is blood-money from him according to
what he has impaired or maimed of the hand of the injured party.
e bodily injury is also like that.”
Mālik said, “When a man intentionally goes to his wife and gouges
out her eye or breaks her hand or cuts oﬀ her ﬁnger or such like, and
does it intentionally, retaliation is inﬂicted on him. As for a man
who strikes his wife with a rope or a whip and hits what he did not
mean to hit or does what he did not intend to do, he pays bloodmoney for what he has struck according to this principle, and
retaliation is not inﬂicted on him.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that Abū Bakr
ibn Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn Ḥazm took retaliation for the
658

breaking of a leg.

43.24 e blood-money and crime of the slave set free and from
whom his former master does not inherit
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from
Sulaymān ibn Yasār that a slave was set free by one of the people on
ḥajj and his master abandoned the right to inherit from him. e
ex-slave then killed a man from the Banū ‘Ā’idh tribe. An ‘Ā’idhī,
the father of the slain man, came to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb seeking
the blood-money of his son. ‘Umar said, “He has no blood-money.”
e ‘Ā’idhī said, “What would you think if it had been my son who
killed him?” ‘Umar said, “en you would pay his blood-money.”
He said, “He is then like the black and white Arqam snake. If it is
left, it devours, and if it is killed, it takes revenge.”

659

44. e Oath of Qasāma
44.1 Beginning with the people seeking blood revenge in the oath
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Layla ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Sahl from Sahl ibn Abī Ḥathma that some of
the notable men of his people informed him that ‘Abdullāh ibn Sahl
and Muḥayyisa went out to Khaybar because extreme poverty had
overtaken them. Muḥayyisa returned and said that ‘Abdullāh ibn
Sahl had been killed and thrown in a shallow well or spring. e
Jews came and he said, “By Allah! You have killed him!” ey said,
“By Allah! We have not killed him!” en he made for his people
and mentioned that to them. en he, his brother Ḥuwayyisa, who
was older than him, and ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān, set out. Muḥayyisa began
to speak, as he he had been at Khaybar. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said to him, “e elder ﬁrst, the elder ﬁrst.’ So Ḥuwayyisa spoke and
then Muḥayyisa spoke. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Either
they pay your companion’s blood-money or we will declare war
against them.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬wrote that to them and
they wrote back, “By Allah, we did not kill him!” e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to Ḥuwayyisa, Muḥayyisa and ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān, “Do
you swear and claim the blood of your companion?” ey said,
“No.” He said, “Shall the Jews swear to you?” ey said, “But they
are not Muslims.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave blood-money
from his own property, and sent them one hundred camels to their
house.
Sahl added, “A red camel among them kicked me.”
Mālik said, “‘Faqīr’ means ‘a well.’”
2 Yaḥyā said from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Buhayr ibn Yasār

informed him that ‘Abdullāh ibn Sahl al-Anṣārī and Muḥayyisa ibn
Mas‘ūd went out to Khaybar and they separated on their various
businesses and ‘Abdullāh ibn Sahl was killed. Muḥayyisa, his brother
660

Ḥuwayyisa and ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Sahl went to the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬,
and ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān began to speak before his brother. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e elder ﬁrst, the elder ﬁrst.”
erefore Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa spoke and mentioned the
aﬀair of ‘Abdullāh ibn Sahl. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to
them, “Do you swear with ﬁfty oaths and claim the blood-money of
your companion or the life of the murderer?” ey said, “Messenger
of Allah, we did not see it and we were not present.” e Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Will you acquit the Jews for ﬁfty oaths?” ey
said, “Messenger of Allah, how can we accept the oaths of a people
who are unbelievers?”

Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “Bushayr ibn Yasār claimed that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬paid the blood-money from his own property.”
Mālik said, “e generally agreed on way of doing things in our
community, and that which I heard from those I am content with,
concerning the oath of qasāma, and that upon which the past and
present imāms agree, is that those who claim revenge begin with the
oaths and swear. e oath for revenge is only obligatory in two
situations: either when the slain person says, ‘My blood is against
so-and-so,’ or the relatives entitled to the blood bring a partial proof
of it that is not irrefutable against the one who is the object of the
blood-claim. is obliges taking an oath on the part of those who
claim the blood against those who are the object of the blood-claim.
With us, swearing is only necessary in these two situations.”
Mālik said, “at is the sunna about which there is no dispute with
us and which is what the people still do. e people who claim
blood begin the swearing, whether it is an intentional killing or an
accident.”
Mālik said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬began with the Banū
Ḥārith in the case of the killing of their kinsman who was murdered
at Khaybar.”

661

Mālik said, “If those who make the claim swear, they deserve the
blood of their kinsman and whoever they swear against is slain.
Only one man can be killed in the qasāma. Two cannot be killed in
it. Fifty men from the blood-relatives must swear ﬁfty oaths. If their
number is less or some of them draw back, they can repeat their
oaths, unless one of the relatives of the murdered man who deserves
blood and who is permitted to pardon it draws back. If one of them
draws back, there is no way to revenge.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e oaths can be made by those of
them who remain if one of them, who is not permitted to pardon,
draws back. If one of the blood-relatives, who is permitted to
pardon, draws back, even if he is only one, more oaths cannot be
made after that by the blood-relatives. If that occurs, the oaths can
be on behalf of the one against whom the claim is made. So ﬁfty of
the men of his people swear ﬁfty oaths. If there are not ﬁfty men,
more oaths can be made by those of them who already swore. If
there is only the defendant, he swears ﬁfty oaths and is acquitted.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “One distinguishes between oaths for
blood and oaths for one’s rights. When a man has a money claim
against another man, he seeks to verify his due. When a man wants
to kill another man, he does not kill him in the midst of people. He
keeps to a place away from people. If there had been only swearing
in cases where there was a clear proof, and if one acted in it as one
acts about one’s rights, (i.e. requiring witnesses), the right of
retribution would have been lost and people would have been quick
to take advantage of it when they learned of the decision about it.
However, the relatives of the murdered man were allowed to initiate
swearing so that people might restrain themselves from blood and
the murderer might beware lest he was put into a situation like that
(i.e. qasāma) by the statement of the murdered man.”
Yaḥyā said, “Mālik talked about a people, of whom a certain number
are suspected of murder, and the relatives of the murdered man ask
them to take oaths and they are numerous, so they ask that each
662

man swears ﬁfty oaths on his own behalf. e oaths are not divided
out between them according to their number and they are not
acquitted unless each man among them swears ﬁfty oaths on his
own behalf.”
Mālik said, “is is the best I have heard about the matter.”
He said, “Swearing goes to the paternal relatives of the slain. ey
are the blood relatives who swear against the killer and by whose
swearing he is killed.”

44.2 Blood relatives who are permitted to swear in the case of an
intentional act
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e way of doing things in our
community about which there is no dispute is that women do not
swear in the swearing for the intentional act. If the murdered man
only has female relatives, the women have no right to swear for
blood and no pardon in the case of murder.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said about a man who is murdered, “If the
paternal relatives of the murdered man or his mawālī say, ‘We swear
and we demand our companion’s blood,’ that is their right.”
Mālik said, “If the women want to pardon him, they cannot do so.
e paternal relatives and mawālī are more entitled to do so than
them because they are the ones who can demand blood and swear
for it.”
Mālik said, “If the paternal relatives of mawālī pardon after they
have demanded blood and the women refuse and say, ‘We will not
abandon our right against the murderer of our companion,’ the
women are more entitled in that case because whoever takes
retaliation is more entitled to it than someone among the women
and paternal relatives who relinquishes it, when the murder is
established and killing obliged.”

663

Mālik said, “At least two claimants must swear at the case of
murder. e oaths are repeated by them until they swear ﬁfty oaths,
then they have the right to blood. at is how things are done in our
community.”
Mālik said, “When people beat a man and he dies in their hands,
they are all slain for him. If he dies after their beating, there is
swearing. If there is swearing, it is only against one man and only he
is slain. We have never known the swearing to be against more than
one man.”
Mālik spoke about a slave who had his hand or foot broken and
then the break mended. He said, “e one who injured him is not
obliged to pay anything. If that break causes him loss or scar, the
one who injured him must pay according to the amount the value of
the slave has been diminished.”
Mālik said, “What is done in our community about retaliation
between slaves is that it is the same as retaliation between freemen:
the life of a slave-girl for the life of a slave, and her injury for his
injury. When a slave intentionally kills a slave, the master of the
murdered slave has a choice. If he wishes, he kills the murderer, and
if he wishes, he takes the blood-money. If he accepts the bloodmoney, he takes the value of his slave. If the owner of the slave who
killed wishes to give the value of the murdered slave, he does so. If
he wishes, he surrenders his slave. If he surrenders him, he is not
obliged to do anything other than that. When the owner of the
murdered slave takes the slave who murdered and is satisﬁed with
him, he must not kill him. All retaliation between slaves for cutting
oﬀ the hand and foot and such things are dealt with in the same way
as in the case of murder.”
Mālik said about a Muslim slave who injures a Jew or Christian, “If
the master of the slave wishes to pay blood-money for him
according to the injury, he does so. Otherwise he surrenders him
and he is sold, and the Jew or Christian is given the blood-money of
664

the injury or all the price of the slave if the blood-money is greater
than his price. e Jew or Christian is not given a Muslim slave.”

44.3 Swearing in the case of manslaughter
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “e procedure in swearing in the case
of manslaughter is that those who claim blood swear and it becomes
due by their swearing. ey swear ﬁfty oaths and there is bloodmoney for them according to the division of their rights of
inheritance. If it is not possible to divide up the oaths they swear
between them evenly, one looks to the one who has the most of
those oaths against him, and that oath against him is taken.”
Mālik said, “If the slain man has only female heirs, they swear and
take the blood-money. If he has only one male heir, he swears ﬁfty
oaths and takes the blood-money. at is only in the case of
accidental killing, not intentional.”

44.4 Inheritance in cases of qasāma
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “When the relatives of the deceased
accept the blood-money, then it is inherited according to the Book
of Allah. Daughters of a dead man inherit and so do sisters, and
whichever women would inherit from him ordinarily. If the women
do not take all his inheritance* then what remains goes to the
agnatic relations who most deserve to inherit from him in
conjunction with the women.”
* i.e. when there are no male Qur’anic heirs.
Mālik said, “If one of the heirs of a man who was killed by mistake
attempts to take his due from the blood-money while his fellow
heirs are absent, he may not do so, and he then has no right to any
of the blood-money, however large or small, unless the qasāma has
been completed by him. If he swears ﬁfty oaths then he has the
right to his portion of the blood-money. at is because the bloodmoney is not established as due without there being ﬁfty oaths, and
the blood-money is not established as due unless the responsibility
665

for the blood is established. If any one of the heirs comes after that,
he swears a number of the oaths commensurate with his fraction of
the inheritance and takes his right until all the heirs exact their
complete rights. If a maternal uncle comes he has one-sixth and
must swear one-sixth of the ﬁfty oaths. So whoever swears may take
his due from the blood-money and whoever abstains annuls his
right. If one of the heirs is absent or is a child who has not reached
puberty, those who are present swear ﬁfty oaths and if the one who
was absent comes after that or the child reaches puberty, they swear,
and they swear according to their due of the blood-money and
according to their share of inheritance from it.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “is is the best I have heard on the
matter.”

44.5 Swearing for blood revenge in cases involving slaves
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “What is done in our community about
slaves is that when a save is struck intentionally or accidentally and
the master brings a witness, he swears with his witness one oath and
then he has the value of the slave. ere is no swearing for revenge
in the case of slaves, whether they were killed accidentally or
intentionally, and I have not heard any of the people of knowledge
say that there was.”
Mālik said, “If a slave is killed intentionally or accidentally, the
master of the slave who is slain has no rights of swearing or oath.
e master cannot demand his right except with a fair proof or a
witness if he swears with one witness.”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik said, “is is the best of what I have heard on
the matter.”

666

45. A Comprehensive Book
45.1 Supplication for Madīna and its people
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī

Ṭalḥa al-Anṣārī from Anas ibn Mālik that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “O Allah! Bless them in their measure and bless them in
their ṣā‘ and mudd.” He meant the people of Madīna.
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Suhayl ibn Abī Ṣāliḥ from

his father that Abū Hurayra said, “When people saw the ﬁrst fruits
of the season, they brought them to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬took them and said, ‘O Allah, bless us in our
fruits! Bless us in our city. Bless us in our ṣā‘ and bless us in our
mudd. O Allah, Ibrāhīm is Your slave, Your Khalīl and Your
Prophet. I am Your slave and Your Prophet. He prayed to You for
Makka. I pray to You for Madīna the same that He prayed to You
for Makka, and the like of it with it.’ en he called the smallest
child he saw and gave him the fruits.”

45.2 What has been narrated about dwelling in Madīna and
leaving it
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Qaṭan ibn Wahb ibn ‘Umayr

in al-Ajda‘ that Yuḥannas, the mawlā of az-Zubayr ibn al-‘Awwām,
informed him that he was sitting with ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar during
the troubles (at the time of al-Ḥajjāj ibn Yūsuf ). A female mawlā of
his came and greeted him. She said, “I want to leave, Abū ‘Abd arRaḥmān. e times are harsh for us.” ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar told her,
“Stay put, O you with little knowledge, for I heard the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘No one will be patient in hunger and hardship in
Madīna without my being a witness or intercessor for him on the
Day of Rising’.”

667

4 Yaḥyā related

to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn alMunkadir from Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh that a Bedouin took an oath of
allegiance in Islam with the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. A fever befell
the Bedouin at Madīna and he went to the Messenger of Allah and
said, “Messenger of Allah, release me from my pledge!” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬refused. en the Bedouin went to him
again and said, “Release me from my pledge!” e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬refused. en he came yet again and said, “Release me
from my pledge!” He refused. e Bedouin left and the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Madīna is like the blacksmith’s furnace. It
removes impurities and puriﬁes the good.”
5 Mālik related to me from that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “I heard Abū

al-Ḥubāb Sa‘īd ibn Yasār say that he heard Abū Hurayra say that he
heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘I was ordered to a town which
will eat up towns. ey used to say “Yathrib” but it is Madīna. It
expels bad people like the blacksmith’s furnace expels impurities
from the iron.”
6 Mālik related to me from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his father that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “No one leaves Madīna preferring

to live elsewhere but that Allah will give it better than him in his
place.”

7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from his

father from ‘Abdullāh ibn az-Zubayr that Sufyān ibn Abī Zuhayr
said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘Yemen will be
conquered and people will be attracted to it, taking their families
and whoever obeys them. Madīna would have been better for them
had they but known. Syria will be conquered and people will be
attracted to it, taking their families and whoever obeys them.
Madīna would have been better for them had they but known. Iraq
will be conquered and people will be attracted to it, taking their
families and whoever obeys them. Madīna would have been better
for them had they but known.’”

668

8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Ḥimās from his paternal
uncle from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“Madīna will be left in the best way until a dog or wolf enters it and
urinates on one of the pillars of the mosque or on the minbar.” ey
asked, “Messenger of Allah, who will have the fruit at that time?”
He replied, “Animals seeking food – birds and wild beasts.”
9 Mālik related to me that he had heard that when ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd

al-‘Azīz left Madīna, he turned back towards it and wept. en he
said, “O Muzāḥim! Aren’t you afraid that we might be among those
that Madīna casts oﬀ?”

45.3 Making Madīna a ḥaram
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Amr, the mawlā of alMuṭṭalib, from Anas ibn Mālik that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬saw

Uḥud and said, “is is a mountain which loves us and we love it. O
Allah, Ibrāhīm made Makka a ḥaram and I will make what is
between the two tracts of black stones (in Madīna) a ḥaram.”
11 Mālik

related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn alMusayyab that Abū Hurayra said, “If I had seen a gazelle at
Madīna, I would have left it to graze and would not have frightened
it. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘What is between the two tracts
of black stones is a ḥaram.’”
12 Mālik related to me from Yūnus ibn Yūsuf from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār

that Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī found some boys who had driven a fox
into a corner and he chased them away from it.
Mālik said, “I only know that he said, ‘Have you done this in the
ḥarām of the Messenger of Allah ‫”’?ﷺ‬

13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from a man who said, “Zayd ibn

ābit came across me while I was at al-Aswāf (on the outskirts of
Madīna). I had captured a hawk. He took it from my hands and set
it free.”



669

45.4 e epidemic of Madīna
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from

his father that ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, said, “When the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came to Madīna, Abū Bakr and Bilāl came
down with a fever. I visited them and said, ‘Father, how are you?
Bilāl, how are you?’” She continued, “When Abū Bakr’s fever
worsened, he would say,
“Every man is struck down among his people in the morning Death is nearer than the strap of his sandal.”
When the fever left Bilāl, he raised his voice and said,
“Would that I knew whether I would spend a night in the valley of
Makka
with the sweet rushes and panic grass around me!
Will I one day return to the waters of Majinna?
Will the mountains of Shāma and Ṭafīl loom before me?”
‘Ā’isha continued, I went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, and told
him. He said, ‘O Allah! Make us love Madīna as much as we love
Makka or even more! Make it healthy and bless us in our ṣā‘ and our
mudd. Remove its fever and put it in al-Juḥfa!’”
15 Mālik said that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd had related to him that ‘Ā’isha

said that ‘Āmir ibn Fuhayra had recited at the time of the epidemic:
“I have seen death before tasting it,
the coward’s death is above him.”

16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nu‘aym ibn ‘Abdullāh alMujmir that Abū Hurayra said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

670

‘ere are angels at the entries of Madīna, and neither plague nor
the Dajjāl will enter it.’”

45.5 e expulsion of the Jews from Madīna
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ismā‘īl ibn Abī Ḥakīm that

he heard ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz say, “One of the last things that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said was, ‘May Allah ﬁght the Jews and
the Christians! ey took the graves of their Prophets as places of
prostration. Two dīns shall not co-exist in the land of the Arabs.’”
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Two dīns shall not co-exist in the

Arabian Peninsula.”

Mālik said that Ibn Shihāb said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb searched for
information about that until he was absolutely convinced that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had said, ‘Two dīns shall not co-exist in the
Arabian Peninsula,’ and he therefore expelled the Jews from
Khaybar.”
19 Mālik said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb expelled the Jews from Najrān

(a Jewish settlement in the Yemen) and Fadak (a Jewish settlement
thirty miles from Madīna). When the Jews of Khaybar left they had
none of the fruit nor the land. e Jews of Fadak had half the fruit
and half the land because the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had made a
settlement with them for that. So ‘Umar paid them the value in
gold, silver, camels, ropes, and saddlebags of half the fruit and half
the land, and handed the value over to them and then expelled
them.”

45.6 Concerning Madīna
20 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came in view of Uḥud and

said, “is is a mountain which loves us and we love it.”
671

21 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Abd

ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Qāsim that Aslam, the mawlā of ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb, informed him that he had visited ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Ayyāsh alMakhzūmī. He saw that he had some nabīdh with him which he
was taking to Makka at that moment. Aslam said to him, “‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb loves this drink.” ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Ayyāsh therefore
carried a large drinking bowl and brought it to ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
and placed it before him. ‘Umar brought it near to him and then
raised his head and said, “is drink is good.” ‘Umar drank some of
it and passed it to a man on his left. ‘Abdullāh turned to go. ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb called him and asked, “Are you the person who says
that Makka is better than Madīna?” ‘Abdullāh said, “I said that it
was the ḥarām of Allah and His place of security and that His
House was in it.” ‘Umar said, “I am not saying anything about the
House of Allah or His ḥarām.” en ‘Abdullāh left.

45.7 About the plague
22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Abd al-

Ḥamīd ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Zayd ibn al-Khaṭṭāb from
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn al-Ḥārith ibn Nawfal from ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Abbās that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb set out for Syria. When he
was at Sargh, near Tabūk, the commanders of the army, Abū
‘Ubayda ibn al-Jarrāḥ and his companions, met him and told him
that the plague had broken out in Syria. Ibn ‘Abbās said that ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Call the ﬁrst Muhājirūn to me.” He assembled
them and asked them for advice, informing them that the plague
had broken out in Syria. ey disagreed about what to do. Some
said, “You have set out for something and we do not think that you
should abandon it.” Others said, “You have the Companions of the
Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬and the rest of the people with you and we do not think
that you should send them towards this plague.” ‘Umar said, “Leave
me.”

en he said, “Summon the Anṣār to me.” ey were summoned
and he asked them for advice. ey behaved as the Muhājirūn had
672

and disagreed just as they had disagreed previously. He said, “Leave
me.” en he said, “Summon to me whoever is here of the aged
men of Quraysh of the Muhājirūn of the Conquest.” ey were
summoned and not one of them diﬀered. ey said, “We think that
you should withdraw the people and not send them towards the
plague.” ‘Umar called out to the people, “I am leaving by camel in
the morning, so you should do the same.” Abū ‘Ubayda said, “Is it
ﬂight from the decree of Allah?” ‘Umar said, “Better that someone
other than you had said it, Abū ‘Ubayda. Yes, we ﬂee from the
decree of Allah to the decree of Allah. What would you think if
these camels had gone down into a valley which had two slopes, one
of them fertile and the other barren? If you pastured in the fertile
part, wouldn’t you pasture them by the decree of Allah? If you
pastured them in the barren part, wouldn’t you pasture them by the
decree of Allah?”
‘Abd ar-Raḥmān, who had been oﬀ doing something, arrived and he
said, “I have some knowledge of this. I heard the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘If you hear about it in a land, do not go forward to it.
If it comes upon a land where you are, then do not depart in ﬂight
from it.’” ‘Umar praised Allah and then set oﬀ.
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from

Muḥammad ibn alMunkadir and from Sālim ibn Abī an-Naḍr, the mawlā of ‘Umar
ibn ‘Ubaydullāh, that ‘Āmir ibn Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ heard his
father ask Usāma ibn Zayd, “Have you heard anything from the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬about the plague?” Usāma said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘e plague is a punishment which was
sent down on a party of the tribe of Isrā‘īl or whoever was before
them. When you hear of it in a land, do not enter it. If it comes
upon a land where you are, do not depart in ﬂight from it.’”
Mālik said that Abū an-Naḍr said, “at is, do not depart with no
intention other than ﬂight.”
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Abdullāh

ibn ‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb set out for Syria.
673

When he reached Sargh, near Tabūk, he heard that the plague had
broken out in Syria. ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf told him that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘If you hear that a land has plague in it,
do not advance to it. If it comes upon a land where you are, do not
depart in ﬂight from it.’” ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb came back from
Sargh.
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sālim ibn

‘Abdullāh that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb turned people back at Sargh
according to the ḥadīth of ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf.

26 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “I heard that ‘Umar ibn al-

Khaṭṭāb said, ‘I prefer a night in Rukba (a valley near Ṭā’if ) to ten
nights in Syria.’”

Mālik said, “He meant to lengthen and preserve their lives because
of the severity of the plague in Syria.”

674

46. e Decree
46.1 e Prohibition against talking about the Decree
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Ādam and

Mūsā argued and Ādam got the better of Mūsā. Mūsā rebuked
Ādam, saying, ‘You are Ādam who led people astray and brought
them out of the Garden.’ Ādam said to him, ‘You are Mūsā to
whom Allah gave knowledge of everything and whom he chose
above other people with His message.’ He said, ‘Yes.’ Ādam said,
‘Do you then censure me for a matter which was decreed for me
before I was even created?’”
YA 2 ḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Abī Unaysa that
‘Abd al-Ḥamīd ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Zayd ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
informed him from Muslim ibn Yasār al-Juhanī that ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb was asked about this āyat, “When your Lord took out all
their descendants from the loins of the children of Adam and made
them testify against themselves: ‘Am I not your Lord?’ ey said,
‘We testify that indeed You are!’ Lest you say on the Day of Rising,
‘We were heedless of this.’” (7:172) ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “I
heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬being asked about it. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted, created
Adam. en He stroked his back with His right hand and some of
his progeny issued from it. He said, “I created these for the Garden
and they will act with the behaviour of the people of the Garden.”
en He stroked his back again and brought forth the rest of his
progeny from him. He said, “I created these for the Fire and they
will act with the behaviour of the people of the Fire.”’ A man asked,
‘Messenger of Allah, then of what value are actions?’ e Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬replied, ‘When Allah creates a slave for the Garden, He
gives him the behaviour of the people of the Garden so that he dies
on one of the actions of the people of the Garden and by it He
brings him into the Garden. When He creates a slave for the Fire,
675

He gives him the behaviour of the people of the Fire so that he dies
on one of the actions of the people of the Fire and by it He brings
him into the Fire.’”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I have left two things with you. As long as you

hold fast to them, you will not go astray. ey are the Book of Allah
and the Sunna of His Prophet.”

4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ziyād ibn Sa‘d from ‘Amr

ibn Muslim that Ṭāwus al-Yamānī said, “I found some of the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬saying, ‘Everything is by
a decree.’”
Ṭāwus added, “I heard ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar say that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Everything is by a decree – even incapacity and
ability.’”
5 Mālik related to me from Ziyād ibn Sa‘d that ‘Amr ibn Dīnār said,

“I heard ‘Abdullāh ibn az-Zubayr say in a khuṭba, ‘Allah – He is the
Guider and the One Who Tempts Away.’”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that his paternal uncle, Abū

Suhayl ibn Mālik, said, “I was a prisoner with ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd
al-‘Azīz. He said, ‘What do you think of these Qadariyya
(proponents of free will)?’ I said, ‘My opinion is that one should ask
them to turn away from wrong action if they will do so. If not,
subject them to the sword. ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azīz said, ‘at is my
opinion.’”
Mālik added, “at is my opinion as well.”

46.2 General section on the People of the Decree
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A woman

should not ask for the divorce of her sister so as to have everything
676

for herself and in order to marry. She will get what is decreed for
her.”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn Ziyād that

Muḥammad ibn Ka‘b al-Quraẓī said, “Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān
said from the minbar, ‘O people! Nothing can keep away what Allah
gives and nothing can give what Allah keeps away. e wealth of a
wealthy person does not proﬁt him. When Allah desires good for
him, He gives him understanding in the dīn.’ en Mu‘āwiya said, ‘I
heard these words from the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬on these very
planks of wood.’”

9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that this was

said, “Praise be to Allah who created everything as is necessary, who
does not hasten anything He defers and determines. Allah is
enough for me and suﬃcient. Allah hears whoever makes
supplication to him. ere is no goal beyond Allah.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that this was said,

“No one will die until his provision is completed for him, so behave
correctly in seeking it.”

2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn
az-Zubayr that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did not have to choose between two matters

but that he chose the easier of them as long as it was not a wrong
action. If it was a wrong action, he was the furthest of people from
it. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did not take revenge for himself
unless the limits of Allah were violated. en he took revenge for it
for Allah.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Alī ibn
Ḥusayn ibn ‘Alī ibn Abī Ṭālib that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

wife of the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A man asked permission to come in to
see the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. I was with him in the house and the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘He is an evil member of his tribe.’
en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave him permission.”

‘Ā’isha continued, “It was not long before I heard the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬laughing with him. When the man left, I said, ‘Messenger
of Allah, you said what you said about him and then before long you
were laughing with him!’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Among
the most evil of people is the one whom people are cautious with
because of his evil.’”
678

5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from his paternal uncle, Abū

Suhayl ibn Mālik, from his father that Ka‘b al-Aḥbar said, “If you

6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “I have

heard that by his good character a man can reach the degree of
someone who stands in prayer at night and who is thirsty from
fasting in the heat of the day.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that he

heard Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab say, “Shall I tell you what is better than

and said, “Messenger of Allah, teach me some words which I can

679

12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Sa‘īd ibn
al-Musayyab from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

Yazīd al-Laythī from Abū Ayyūb al-Anṣārī that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “It is not lawful for a Muslim to shun his brother for
more than three nights; that is they meet, and this one turns away
and that one turns away. e better of the two is the one who gives
the greeting ﬁrst.”

14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Anas ibn
Mālik that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do not be angry with

1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that Jābir

ibn ‘Abdullāh al-Anṣārī said, “We went out with the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬in the raid on the Banū Anmār tribe.” Jābir said, “I was
resting under a tree when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came up. I
said, ‘Messenger of Allah, come into the shade.’ So the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came and sat down, and I stood up and went to a bag
that we had. I looked in it for something and found a small
cucumber and broke it. en I brought it to the Messenger of Allah
‫ﷺ‬. He asked, ‘Where did you get this from?’ I said, ‘We brought it
from Madīna, Messenger of Allah.’”
Jābir continued, “We had a friend with us whom we used to equip
to go out to guard our mounts. I gave him what was necessary and
then he turned to go to the mounts. He was wearing two threadbare
cloaks he owned. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬looked at him and
asked, ‘Does he have two garments other than these?’ I said, ‘Yes,
Messenger of Allah. He has two garments in the bag. I gave them
to him,’ and he said, ‘Let him go and put them on.’ I told him to go
out to put them on. As he turned to go, the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
exclaimed, ‘May Allah strike his neck! Isn’t that better for him?’ He
said (taking him literally), ‘Messenger of Allah, in the way of Allah!’
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘In the way of Allah.’”

‘Umar wore garments dyed with red earth and dyed with saﬀron.

wearing gold rings and I disapprove of it for males, old or young.”

saﬄower in their houses and courtyards, ‘I do not know that it is

scarf. ‘Ā’isha tore it in two and made a wide one for her.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muslim ibn Abī Maryam

from Abū Ṣāliḥ that Abū Hurayra said, “Women who are naked,
even though they are wearing clothes, go astray and make others go
astray, and they will not enter the Garden nor will they experience
its fragrance, and its fragrance can be experienced from as far as the
distance travelled in ﬁve hundred years.”
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Ibn
Shihāb that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stood up in the night and

683

looked at the horizon and said, “What treasures has the night

their rooms.”

and Zayd ibn Aslam that all of them informed him from ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “On the Day of
Rising, Allah will not look at a person who trailed his garment out
of arrogance.”

12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from al-‘Alā’ ibn ‘Abd ar-

Rahmān that his father said, “I asked Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī about the
lower garment. He said that he would inform me with knowledge
and that he had heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘e lower
garment of the believer should reach the middle of his calves. ere
is no harm in what is between that and the ankles. What is lower
than that is in the Fire. What is lower than that is in the Fire. On
the Day of Rising, Allah will not look at a person who trails his
lower garment out of arrogance.’”

48.6 A woman trailing her garments
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Bakr ibn Nāﬁ‘ from

his father, Nāﬁ‘, the mawlā of Ibn ‘Umar, that Ṣaﬁyya bint Abī

684

‫ﷺ‬, said that when the lower garment of women was mentioned to

48.7 Wearing sandals
14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abūu Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Do

not wear one sandal. Wear both of them or go with both feet bare.”

15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“When you put on sandals, begin with the right foot. When you
take them oﬀ, begin with the left foot. e right foot is the ﬁrst to
be put in the sandal and the last to be taken out.”

16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from his paternal uncle, Abū

Suhayl ibn Mālik, from his father that Ka‘b al-Aḥbar said to a man
who took oﬀ his sandals, “Why have you taken oﬀ your sandals?
Perhaps you have interpreted this āyat, ‘Take oﬀ your sandals. You
are in the holy valley of Ṭuwā’? (20:12) Do you know what the
sandals of Musā were?”
Mālik (Abū Suhayl’s father) said, “I do not know what the man
answered.” Ka‘b said, “ey were made from the skin of a dead
donkey.”

48.8 Ways of dressing
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj that Abū Hurayra said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade

two kinds of sale: mulāmasa, in which a man is obliged to buy
whatever he touches without any choice in the matter, and
munābadha, in which two men throw their garment to each other
without either seeing the other’s garment. He also forbade two ways
of dressing: one in which a man sits with his legs drawn up to his
chest wrapped in one garment that does not cover his genitals, and
685

the other in which a man wraps a single garment over one arm and
shoulder restricting them.”
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar that ‘Abdullāh saw a silk robe at the door of the mosque. He
said, “Messenger of Allah, would you buy this robe and wear it on
jumu‘a and when envoys come to you?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, “No one wears this but a person who has no portion in the
Next World.” en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was brought some
robes of the same material and gave one of them to ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb. ‘Umar said, “Messenger of Allah, do you clothe me in it
when you said what you said about the robe of ‘Uṭārid?” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I did not give it to you to wear.” ‘Umar
gave it to a brother of his in Makka who was still an idolator.
19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī

Talḥa said, “Anas ibn Mālik said, ‘I saw ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb when

commissioned him at the age of forty. He stayed in Makka ten years

2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn

I was at the Ka‘ba, and I saw a dark man like the most handsome of
dark men you have ever seen. He had hair which reached to between
his ears and his shoulders like the most excellent of such hair that
you have ever seen. He had combed his hair and water was dripping
from it. He was leaning on two men or on the shoulders of two men
doing ṭawāf around the Ka‘ba. I asked, ‘Who is this?’ I was told,
‘e Messiah, son of Maryam.’ en we were with a man with wiry
hair who was blind in his right eye, which resembled a ﬂoating
grape. I asked, ‘Who is this?’ I was told, ‘is is the Dajjāl (lit.
Dajjāl Messiah).’”

person to trim the moustache and the ﬁrst person to see grey hair.
He said, ‘O Lord! What is this?’ Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted,
said, ‘It is dignity, Ibrāhīm.’ He said, ‘Lord, increase me in dignity.’”

Yaḥyā said that he had heard Mālik say, “One takes from the

not start begging from other people.”

19 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī

Talḥa heard Anas ibn Mālik say that Abū Talḥa had said to Umm
Sulaym, “I have just been listening to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

have anything?” She replied, “Yes,” and brought out some barley
loaves. She took her long head scarf and wrapped up the bread in
part of it and put it into Anas’ hand and gave him part of it to wear.
en she sent him to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.
Anas continued, “I took it and found the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
sitting in the mosque with some people. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘Did Abū Talḥa send you?’ I replied, ‘Yes.’ He said, ‘For food?’
I said, ‘Yes.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to those with him, ‘Let
us go.’ He set oﬀ and I went along with them until I came to Abū
Talḥa and told him. Abū Talḥa said, ‘Umm Sulaym! e Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬has brought people and we have no food. What shall we
give them to eat?’ She said, ‘Allah and His Messenger know best.’
“Abū Talḥa went out and met the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
approached with Abū Talḥa until they entered the house. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Come now, Umm Sulaym, what have

permission, and they ate until they were full and left. en he said,
‘Give permission to ten more.’ He gave them permission and they

from Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Lock

the door, tie up the waterskin, turn the vessel over or cover it and

tied knot or uncover a vessel. A mouse may set ﬁre to people’s
houses about them.”

22 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sa‘īd ibn Abī Sa‘īd al-

Maqburī from Abū Shurayḥ al-Ka‘bī that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak
good words or be silent. Whoever believes in Allah and the Last
Day should be generous to his neighbour. Whoever believes in
Allah and the Last Day should be generous to his guest. His
welcome is for a day and a night, and his hospitality is for three
days. Whatever is more than that is ṣadaqa. It is not lawful for a
guest to stay with a man until he becomes a burden.”
23 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr, from Abū Ṣāliḥ as-Sammān from Abū Hurayra that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A man was walking on a road when he
became very thirsty. He found a well and went into it and drank and
then came out. ere was a dog panting and eating earth out of
thirst. e man said, ‘is dog has become as thirsty as I was.’ He
went down into the well and ﬁlled his shoe and then held it in his
mouth until he climbed out and gave the dog water to drink. Allah
thanked him for it and forgave him.” ey said, “Messenger of
Allah, do we have a reward for taking care of beasts?” He said,
“ere is a reward for every one with a moist liver.”
24 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Wahb ibn Kaysān that
Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent a

delegation to the coast. Abū ‘Ubayda ibn al-Jarrāḥ was in command
of them. ere were three people and I was one of them. We went
out until head gone part of the way and our provisions were
692

ﬁnished. Abū ‘Ubayda ordered that the provisions of the army be
gathered up and they amounted to two containers of dates. He used
to give us a little provision from it each day until it was ﬁnished, and
we used to have only a single date each. I said, ‘What is the use of
one date?’ He said, ‘We will certainly feel its loss when they are
ﬁnished.’”
Jābir continued, “en we reached the sea and there was a ﬁsh like a
small mountain (ẓarib). e army ate from it for eighteen nights.
en Abū ‘Ubayda ordered two ribs from it to be set up. en he
commanded that a camel be ridden underneath them and it did not
touch them.”
“Ẓarib” is a small mountain.
25 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Amr

ibn Sa‘d ibn Mu‘ādh from his grandmother that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “O believing women, none of you must consider even
a roasted sheep’s trotter too small to give to her neighbour.”
26 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr said,
“e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘May Allah curse the Jews! ey

were forbidden to eat fat, so they sold it and ate its price’.”

27 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that ‘Īsā ibn

Maryam used to say, “O tribe of Israel! You must drink pure water
and the green things of the land, and barley bread. Beware of having
wheat bread, for you will not be grateful enough for it.”
Y 28 aḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬entered the mosque and found Abū Bakr aṣṢiddīq and ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb there. He questioned them and
they said, “Hunger has driven us out.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, “And hunger has brought me out.” ey went to Abū alHaytham ibn at-Tayyihān al-Anṣārī who ordered some barley that
was in the house be prepared and he got up to slaughter a sheep for
them. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Leave the one with milk.”
693

He slaughtered a sheep for them and brought them pure sweet
water which was hanging on a palm tree. en they were brought
the food and ate it and drank the water. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
recited, “en you will be asked that Day about the pleasures you
enjoyed.” (102:8)
29 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Umar

ibn al-Khaṭṭāb was eating bread with ghee. He summoned one of
the desert people and he began to eat and mop up the grease in the
dish with a morsel of bread. ‘Umar said, “It is as if you were
lacking.” He said, “By Allah, I have not eaten ghee nor have I seen
food with it since such-and-such a time!” ‘Umar declared, “I shall
not eat clariﬁed butter until people are give life again like they were
ﬁrst given life (i.e. on the Day of Rising).”
30 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Ṭalḥa that Anās ibn Mālik said, “I saw ‘Umar ibn
al-Khaṭṭāb when he was Amīr al-Mu’minīn being given a ṣā‘ of
dates and he ate all of them, even the inferior ones.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnar that
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said, “‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb was asked about
locusts. He said, ‘I would like to have a basket of them from which
we could eat.’’”
31 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn

Ḥalḥala that Ḥumayd ibn Mālik ibn Khuthaym said, “I was sitting
with Abū Hurayra on his land at al-‘Aqīq. Some people rode out
from Madīna to call upon Abū Hurayra. He told me to go to his
mother, sending his greetings and asking her to prepare some food.”
Ḥumayd continued, “She set down three loaves on a plate and some
oil and salt. en she put it on my head and I carried it to them.
When I set it before them, Abū Hurayra said, ‘Allah is greater,’ and
added, ‘Praise be to Allah who has ﬁlled us with bread after our
food had previously only been water and dates,’ as the people did
not touch any of the food.
694

“When they left, he said, ‘O son of my brother, be good to your
sheep and wipe the mucus from them and clean their pen. Pray in
their quarter for they are among the animals of the Garden. By Him
in Whose Hand my soul is, a time is about to come upon people
when a small group of sheep will be more beloved to their owner
than the house of Marwān.’”
32 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Nu‘aym that Wahb
ibn Kaysān said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was brought food

while his stepson, ‘Umar ibn Salama, was with him. e Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told him, ‘ Say “Bismillāh” and eat what is in front of
you.’”
33 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that he

had heard al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad say that a man came to
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās and said to him, “I have an orphan who has
camels. Can I drink from the camels’ milk?” Ibn ‘Abbās said, “If you
search for the lost camels of his and treat the camels’ mange and ﬁll
in the cracks in their water basin and give them water on the day
they drink, then drink the milk without doing any harm to the
suckling camels by milking their mothers excessively.”
34 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father never brought food nor drink, nor even a remedy which he
consumed but that he said, “Praise be to Allah who has guided us
and given us to drink and blessed us! Allah is greater! O Allah! We
have found Your blessing accompanying every evil, give us every
good in the morning and evening! We ask You for its completion
and for gratitude. ere is no good except Your good. ere is god
other than You, the God of the right-acting and the Lord of the
Worlds. Praise be to Allah! ere is no god but Allah. What Allah
wills. ere is no power except in Allah. O Allah, bless us in what
You have provided us with and protect us from the punishment of
the Fire!”

35 Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked, “Can a woman eat with other

than her relative or slave?” Mālik said, “ere is no harm in that if it
is in a manner which is accepted for a woman to eat with men.”

Mālik said, “A woman sometimes eats with her husband and with
others he dines with or with her brother in the same way. It is
disapproved of for a woman to be alone with a man when there is no
relationship between them by blood, marriage or suckling that
would prevent him marrying her.”

49.11 Eating meat
36 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Umar

ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said, “Beware of meat. It has addictiveness like the
addictiveness of wine.”

Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Umar
ibn al-Khaṭṭāb saw Jābir ibn ‘Abdullāh carrying some meat. He said,
“What is this?” He replied, “Amīr al-Mu’minīn, we desired meat
and I bought some meat for a dirham.” ‘Umar said, “Does one of
you want to ﬁll his belly to the exclusion of his neighbour or
nephew? How can you overlook this āyat? ‘You dissipated the good
things you had in your worldly life and enjoyed yourself in it.’
(46:20)”

49.12 Wearing rings
37 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār from
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to wear a
gold ring. en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stood up and threw it

away and said, “I will never wear it.” He said, “So the people threw
away their rings.”
696

38 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ṣadaqa ibn Yasār said, “I

asked Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab about wearing a ring. He said, “Wear it
and tell people that I gave you that decision.”

39 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr

from ‘Abbād ibn Tamīm that Abū Bashīr al-Ansārī told him that he
was with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬on one of his journeys. He
related, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent a messenger.” (‘Abdullāh
ibn Abī Bakr said, “I think that he said it was while the people were
in their resting place.”) e messenger said, “Do not let a singlestring necklace or any necklace remain unbroken on the neck of a
camel.”
Yaḥyā said, “I heard Mālik say, ‘I think that was because of the evil
eye.’”

697

50. e Evil Eye
50.1 Wuḍū’ against the Evil Eye
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Muḥammad ibn Abī Umāma

ibn Sahl ibn Ḥunayf heard his father say, “My father, Sahl ibn
Ḥunayf, had a ghusl at al-Kharrār. He removed the jubbah he had
on while ‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a was watching, and Sahl was a man with
beautiful skin. ‘Āmir said to him, ‘I have never seen anything like I
have seen today, not even the skin of a virgin.’ Sahl fell ill on the
spot and his condition worsened. Somebody went to the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and told him that Sahl was ill and could not go with
him. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬came to him, and Sahl told him
what had happened with ‘Āmir. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘Why does one of you kill his brother? Why did you not say, “May
Allah bless you (tabāraka’llāh)”? e evil eye is real. Do wuḍū’
against its eﬀects.’ ‘Āmir did wuḍū’ against it and Sahl went with the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and there was nothing wrong with him.”
2 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb that Abū Umāma ibn Sahl

ibn Ḥunayf said, “‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a saw Sahl ibn Hunayf having a
ghusl and said, ‘I have not seen the like of what I see today, not even
the skin of a maiden who has never been outdoors.’ Sahl fell to the
ground. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬arrived and it was said,
‘Messenger of Allah! Can you do anything about Sahl ibn Hunayf?
By Allah, he cannot even lift his head.’ He said, ‘Do you suspect
anyone of it?’ ey said, ‘We suspect ‘Āmir ibn Rabi‘a.’”
He continued, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬summoned ‘Āmir and
was furious with him, saying, ‘Why does one of you kill his brother?
Why did you not say, “May Allah bless you”? Do ghusl for it!’ ‘Āmir
washed his face, hands, elbows, knees, the end of his feet, and inside
his lower garment in a vessel. en he poured it over him and Sahl
went oﬀ with the people, and there was nothing wrong with him.”

698

50.2 Guarding against the Evil Eye
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ḥumayd ibn Qays al-Makkī
said, “A man came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬with the two sons

of Ja‘far ibn Abī Ṭālib. He asked their nursemaid, ‘Why are they so
thin?’ eir nursemaid answered, ‘Messenger of Allah, the evil eye
goes quickly to them. Nothing stops us from asking someone to
make talismans (using āyats of Qur’ān) for them, except that we do
not know what you approve of in that.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘Make talismans for them. Had anything been able to outstrip
the decree, the evil eye would do so.’”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from

Sulaymān ibn Yasār that ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr told him that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬entered the house of Umm Salama, the wife
of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬. ere was a child weeping in the house and they
said that it was from the evil eye. ‘Urwa said, “e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Why do you not ﬁnd someone to make a talisman to
protect him from the evil eye?’”

50.3 e invalid’s reward
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When the slave is

ill, Allah sends two angels to him.” He said, “ey look at what he
says to his visitors. If he praises Allah when they come to him, they
take that up to Allah, the Mighty, the Majestic – and He knows
best – and He says, ‘If I make My slave die, I will make him enter
the Garden. If I heal him, I will replace his ﬂesh with better ﬂesh
and his blood with better blood and I will eﬀace his wrong actions.”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn Khuṣayfa that

‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr said that he heard ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, ‘When a believer is aﬄicted by something, even a
thorn, it removes (or eﬀaces) his wrong actions.’”
Yazīd did not know which word ‘Urwa said.
699

7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Muḥammad ibn ‘Abdullāh

Ibn Abī Ṣa‘ṣa‘a said that he heard Abū al-Hubāb Sa‘īd ibn Yasār say
that he had heard Abū Hurayra say, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘Allah aﬄicts the one for whom He desires good.’”

8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that death
came to a man in the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. A man

said, “He was fortunate,” as he had died without being tried by
illness. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Alas for you, what will let
you know that if Allah had tried him with illness, He would have
wiped out his wrong actions.”

50.4 Seeking refuge and using talismans in illness
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yazīd ibn Khuṣayfa that

‘Amr ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Ka‘b as-Salamī told him that Nāﬁ‘ ibn
Jubayr came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. ‘Uthmān ibn Abī al-‘Āṣ
also came to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. ‘Uthmān said that he had a
pain which was enough to kill him. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“Rub it with your right hand seven times and say, ‘I take refuge with
the might of Allah and His power from the evil of what I feel.’”
‘Uthmān added, “I said that and Allah removed what I had. I still
command my family and others to say it.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn
az-Zubayr from ‘Ā’isha that when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬had a

complaint, he would recite the last three sūras of the Qur’ān over
himself and blow. She said, “When his pain was great, I would
recite it over him and wipe him with his right hand hoping for its
blessing.”

11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from ‘Amra

bint ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān that Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq visited ‘Ā’isha at a
time when she had a complaint and a Jewish woman was writing a
talisman for her. Abū Bakr said, “Write it for her from the Book of
Allah.”

50.5 Treating the invalid
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that a man
received a wound in the time of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. e

blood clotted in the wound and the man called two men from the
Banū Anmār tribe. ey looked at it and claimed that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked them, “Which of you is the better
doctor?” ey said, “Is there any good in medicine, Messenger of
Allah?” Zayd claimed that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e
One who sent down the disease also sent down the remedy.”
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “I

was brought to Asmā’ bint Abī Bakr, she made supplication for her
and took water and poured it inside her collar. She said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered us to cool it with water.”
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Fever comes from

the vehemence of the heat of Hell, so cool it with water.”

Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from Ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Fever comes from the vehemence of the heat of
Jahannam, so put it out with water.”

701

17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard from Jābir ibn

with him, it settles in him” or something like that.
18 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard from Bukayr

ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn al-Ashajj from Ibn ‘Aṭiya that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere is no contagion, no hāma, and no serpent in a
hungry belly. However, the possessor of sick livestock must not stop
his animals at the same place as the possessor of healthy livestock,
but the possessor of healthy livestock may stop wherever he wishes.”
ey said, “Messenger of Allah, why is that?” e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “It is harmful.”

1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Bakr ibn Nāﬁ‘ from his

father Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah

ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Awf heard Mu‘āwiya ibn Abī Sufyān say
from the minbar in the year that he performed the ḥajj, holding a
lock of hair (i.e. a hairpiece) which he took from one of his guards,
“People of Madīna! Where are your learned men? I heard the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbid things like this, saying, ‘e tribe of
Israel were destroyed when their women started to use this.’”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Ziyād ibn Sa‘d heard Ibn
Shihāb say, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬let his hair hang down his

forehead as Allah willed, and afterwards he parted it.”

‘Umar disapproved of castration and said, “e completeness of the
created form is in the testicles.”

703

6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Abū
Qatāda al-Anṣārī said to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “I have a lot of

hair which comes down to my shoulders, shall I let it down?” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Yes, and honour it.” Sometimes Abū
Qatāda oiled it twice in the same day because the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told him, “Honour it.”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār told him that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was in the

mosque when a man came in with dishevelled hair and beard. e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬motioned with his hand that he should be
sent out to groom his hair and beard. e man did so and then
returned. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Is this not better than
that one of you should come with his head dishevelled as if he were
a shayṭān?”

51.3 Dyeing the hair
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that

Muḥammad ibn Ibrāhīm at-Taymī had informed him that Abū
Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān said, “‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Aswad
ibn ‘Abd al-Yaghūth used to sit with us and he had a white beard
and hair. One day he came to us and he had dyed his beard and
head red, and the people told him, ‘is is better.’ He said, ‘‘Ā’isha,
the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, sent her slave-girl Nukhayla to me
yesterday. She entreated me to dye my hair and she informed me
that Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq used to dye his hair.’”
Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say about dyeing the hair black, “I
have not heard anything certain on that, but I prefer other colours.”
Yaḥyā said, “Not to dye at all is permitted, Allah willing, and there
is no constraint on people concerning it.”
Yaḥyā said that he had heard Mālik say, “ere is a clear indication
in this ḥadīth that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬did not dye his hair.

704

Ā

Had the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬dyed his hair, ‘Ā’isha would have
sent a message to that eﬀect to ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn al-Aswad.”

Chapters on Seeking Refuge and ose who Love Each other for

51.4 What is commanded of seeking refuge in Allah
9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said that he

had heard that Khālid ibn al-Walīd said to the Messenger of Allah
‫ﷺ‬, “I have nightmares.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him,
“Say, ‘I seek refuge with the complete words of Allah from His
anger and His punishment and the evil of His slaves, and from the
evil suggestions of the shayṭāns and from their being present (at
death).’”
A‘ūdhu bi kalimāti’llāhi’t-tāmmati min ghaḍabihi wa ‘iqābihi wa
sharri ‘ibādhihi wa min hamazāti’sh-shayāṭīni wa an yaḥḍurūn.
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “When
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was taken on the Night Journey, he saw

an evil jinn seeking him out with a ﬁery torch. Whenever the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬turned, he saw him. Jibrīl said to him, ‘Shall
I teach you some words to say? When you say them, his torch will
be extinguished and fall from him.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘Yes, indeed.’ Jibrīl said, ‘Say, “I seek refuge with the Noble Face of
Allah and with the complete words of Allah, which neither a good
person nor a corrupt one can exceed, from the evil of what descends
from the sky and the evil of what ascends in it, and from the evil of
what is created in the earth and the evil of what comes out of it, and
from the trials of the night and day, and from the visitations of the
night and day, except for one that knocks with good, O Merciful!”’”

11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Suhayl ibn Abī Ṣāliḥ from

his father from Abū Hurayra that a man of the Aslam tribe said, “I
did not sleep last night.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, said to him,
“For what reason?” He replied, “A scorpion stung me.” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Had you said in the evening, ‘I seek
refuge with the complete words of Allah from the evil of what He
has created,’ it would not have happened.”
A‘ūdhu bi kalimāti’llāhi’t-tāmmāti min sharri mā khalaq.
12 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū

Bakr, from al-Qa‘qā‘ ibn Ḥakīm that Ka‘b al-Aḥbar said, “If it had
not been for some words which I said, the Jews would have made
me into a monkey.” Someone asked him what they were. He said, “I
seek refuge with the Immense Face of Allah – there is nothing
greater than it – and with the complete words of Allah which
neither the good person nor the corrupt can exceed and with all the
most beautiful names of Allah, what I know of them and what I do
not know, from the evil, of what He has created, originated and
multiplied.”

Raḥmān al-Anṣārī from Ḥafṣ ibn ‘Āsim that either Abū Sa‘īd alKhudrī or Abū Hurayra said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
‘ere are seven whom Allah will shade in His shade on the day on
which there is no shade except His shade: a just imām, a youth who
grows up worshipping Allah, a man whose heart is attached to the
mosque when he leaves it until he returns to it, two men who love
each other in Allah and meet for that and part for that, a man who
remembers Allah when he is alone and his eyes overﬂow with tears,
a man who refuses the approaches of a noble, beautiful woman,
saying, “I fear Allah”, and a man who gives ṣadaqa and conceals it so
that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives.’”
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Suhayl ibn Abī Sālih from
his father from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“If Allah loves a slave, he says to Jibrīl, ‘I love so-and-so, so love
him,’ so Jibrīl loves him and then calls out to the people of heaven,
‘Allah loves so-and-so, so love him,’ and the people of heaven love
him. en acceptance is placed in the earth for him.”
As for when Allah is angry with a slave, Mālik said, “I consider that
He says the like of that about His anger.”
16 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū Ḥāzim ibn Dīnār that

Abū Idrīs al-Khawlanī said, “I entered the Damascus mosque and
there was a young man with a beautiful mouth and white teeth
sitting with some people. When they disagreed about something,
they referred it to him and acted according to his statement. I
inquired about him, and was told, ‘is is Mu‘ādh ibn Jabal.’ e
next day I went to the noon prayer and I found that he had got to
the noon prayer before me and I found him praying.”
Abū Idrīs continued, “I waited for him until he had ﬁnished the
prayer. en I came to him from in front of him and greeted him
and said, ‘By Allah! I love you for Allah!’ He said, ‘By Allah?’ I said,
‘By Allah.’ He said, ‘By Allah?’ I said, ‘By Allah.’ He said, ‘By
Allah?’ I said, ‘By Allah!’”
707

He continued, “He took me by the upper part of my cloak and
pulled me to him and said, ‘Rejoice! I heard the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬say, “Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, said, ‘My love is obliged for
those who love each other in Me, and those who sit with each other
in Me, and those who visit each other in Me and those who give to
each other generously in Me.’”’”
17 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he had heard that ‘Abdullāh

ibn ‘Abbās said, “Equanimity, gentleness, and good behaviour are
one twenty-ﬁfth part of prophethood.”

52. Visions
52.1 Visions
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī

Ṭalḥa al-Anṣārī from Anas ibn Mālik that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬said, “A good dream of a man who is right-acting is a forty-sixth
part of prophethood.”

Yaḥyā related the like of that to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād
from al-A‘raj from Abū Hurayra from the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī

Ṭalḥa from Zufar ibn Ṣa‘ṣa‘a from his father from Abū Hurayra that
when the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬left the morning prayer, he would
say, “Did any of you have a dream last night? All that will remain of
prophethood after me will be the true dream.”
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “All that will be left

of prophethood after me are the mubashshirāt.” ey asked, “What
are the mubashshirāt, Messenger of Allah?” He said, “A true dream
which a man who is right-acting sees – or which is shown to him –
is a forty-sixth part of prophecy.”
4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that Abū

Salama ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān said that he heard Abū Qatāda ibn
Rib‘iyy say that he heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, “Good
dreams are from Allah and bad dreams are from Shayṭān. When
you see what you dislike in a dream, spit to your left side three times
when you wake up and seek refuge with Allah from its evil. en it
will not harm you, Allah willing.”
Abū Salama said, “I would see dreams which weighed on me more
heavily than a mountain. When I heard this ḥadīth, I was no longer
concerned about it.”
709

5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Hishām ibn ‘Urwa that his

father said that the āyat, “ere is good news for them in the life of
this world and in the Next World,” (10:64), refers to a good dream
which a man who is righteous has or which was shown to him.

52.2 Games of dice
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Mūsā ibn Maysara from

Sa‘īd ibn Abī Hind from Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever plays games of dice has disobeyed Allah
and His Messenger.”
Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Alqama from his mother that
‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, heard that the people who lived
in a room in her house had some dice. She sent a message to them,
“If you do not remove them, I will remove you from my house,” and
she reproached them for it.
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar that when he found one of his family playing dice, he beat
him and destroyed the dice.

Yaḥyā said that he heard Mālik say, “ere is no good in chess,” and
he disapproved of it. Yaḥyā said, “I heard him disapprove of playing
it and other worthless games. He recited this āyat: ‘What is there
after truth except misguidance?’ (10:32)”

710

53. Greetings
53.1 Behaviour in greeting
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Someone riding should greet someone

walking, and when one of a group of people gives a greeting, it is
enough for all of them.”
2 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Wahb ibn Kaysān that

Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn ‘Aṭā’ said, “I was sitting with ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Abbās when a Yemeni man came in. He said, ‘Peace be upon
you and the mercy of Allah and His blessing (as-Salāmu ‘alaykum
wa raḥmatullāh wa barakātuhu)’ and then he added something more
to that. Ibn ‘Abbās asked (at that time his eyesight had gone), ‘Who
is this?’ People said, ‘is is a Yemeni who has come to see you,’ and
they introduced him, Ibn ‘Abbās said, ‘e greeting ends with the
word blessing.’”
Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked, “Does one greet a woman?” He
said, “As for an old woman, I do not disapprove of it. As for a young
woman, I do not like it.”

53.2 Greeting Jews and Christians
3 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār that
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“When a Jew greets you and says, ‘Poison to you (as-sāmu
‘alaykum)’, say, ‘And to you.’”

Yaḥyā said that Mālik was asked whether a person who greeted a
Jew or Christian should apologise for it. He said, “No.”

53.3 General section on the greeting

711

4 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī

Ṭalḥa from Abū Murra, the mawlā of ‘Aqīl ibn Abī Ṭālib, from Abū
Wāqid al-Laythī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was sitting in the
mosque with some people when three people came in. Two of them
came towards the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and one went away. When
the two stopped at the assembly of the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬they
gave the greeting. One of them saw a gap in the circle and sat in it.
e other sat down behind the circle. e third turned away and
left. When the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ﬁnished, he said, “Shall I tell
you about three people? One of them sought shelter with Allah, so
Allah gave him shelter. e other was shy, so Allah was shy to him.
e other turned away, so Allah turned away from him.”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī

Ṭalḥa that Anas ibn Mālik heard ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb return the
greeting of a man who greeted him. en ‘Umar asked the man,
“How are you?” He answered, “I praise Allah to you (aḥmadu
ilayka’llāh).” ‘Umar said, “at is what I wanted from you.”
6 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī

Ṭalḥa that at-Ṭufayl ibn Ubayy ibn Ka‘b told him that he visited
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar one morning and went out with him to the
market. When they were out, ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar did not pass by
anyone selling poor merchandise or selling commodities or a needy
person or anyone without greeting them.

At-Ṭufayl said, “I came to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar one day and he
asked me to follow him to the market. I said to him, ‘What will you
do in the market if you will not stop to sell nor seek any goods or
barter with them or sit in any of the assemblies of the market?’
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar said that we should sit down and talk, and then
he said, ‘Abū Baṭn (lit. father of the belly, as at-Ṭufayl had a
prominent stomach), we go out in the morning only for the sake of
the greeting. We greet whomever we meet.’”
7 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that a man

greeted ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar. He said, “Peace be upon you and the
712

mercy of Allah and His blessings, on and on.” ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar
said to him, “And on you, a thousand times” as if he disliked that.
8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that when one

entered an unoccupied house, one should say, “Peace be upon us and
on the slaves of Allah who are right-acting (as-salāmu ‘alayna wa ‘alā
‘ibādillāhi’ṣ-ṣālihīn).”

713

54. General
54.1 Asking permission to enter
1 Mālik related to me from Ṣafwān ibn Sulaym from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was questioned by a man who said,

“Messenger of Allah, should I ask permission of my mother to
enter?” He said, “Yes.” e man said, “I live with her in the house.”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Ask her permission.” e man
said, “I am her servant.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Ask her
permission. Do you want to see her naked?” He said, “No.” He said,
“en ask her permission.”
2 Mālik related to me from a reliable source of his from Bukayr ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn al-Ashajj from Basr ibn Sa‘īd from Abū Sa‘īd alKhudrī that Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘One asks permission three times. If you are given permission,
then enter. If not, go away.’”
3 Mālik related to me from Rabi‘a ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān from

another of the scholars of that time that Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī came
and asked permission from ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb to enter. He asked
permission three times and then went away. ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
sent after him and said, “What is wrong with you? Why did you not
come in?” Abū Mūsā said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say,
‘Ask permission to enter three times. If you are given permission,
then enter. If not, go away.’”
‘Umar said, “Who can conﬁrm this? If you do not bring me
someone to conﬁrm, I will do such-and-such to you.”
Abū Mūsā went out until he came to an assembly in the mosque
which was called the Majlis al-Anṣār. He said, “I told ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb that I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, ‘Ask permission
three times. If you are given permission, then enter. If not, go away.’
714

‘Umar said, ‘If you do not bring me someone who can conﬁrm it, I
will do such-and-such to you.’ If any of you have heard that, let him
come with me.” ey said to Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī, “Go with him.”
Abū Sa‘īd was the youngest of them. He went with him and told
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb about that.
‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb said to Abū Mūsā, “I did not suspect you, but
I feared lest people forge sayings of the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬.”

54.2 Blessing someone who sneezes
4 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr from his father
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If a man sneezes, invoke a

blessing on him. en if he sneezes, invoke a blessing on him. en
if he sneezes, invoke a blessing on him. en if he sneezes again,
say, ‘You have a cold.’” ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr said, “I don’t know
whether it was after the third or the fourth.”
5 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that when ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar

sneezed and someone said to him, “May Allah have mercy on you
(yarḥamuka’llāh),” he said, “May Allah have mercy on us and you
and forgive us and you (yarḥamuna’llāh wa yaghﬁr lanā wa lakum).”

54.3 Pictures and images
6 Mālik related to me from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Ṭalḥa that

Rāﬁ‘ ibn Ishāq, the mawlā of ash-Shifā’, informed him that he and
‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Ṭalḥa had gone to visit Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī while
he was ill. Abū Sa‘īd said to them, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
informed us, ‘Angels do not enter a house which contains pictures or
images.’”
Isḥāq was not sure which of them Abū Sa‘īd said.
7 Mālik related to me from Abū an-Naṣr that ‘Ubaydullāh ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd went to visit Abū Ṭalḥa al-Anṣārī
when he was ill. He said, “I found Sahl ibn Ḥunayf with him. Abū
Ṭalḥa summoned a man and removed a rug which was under him.
715

Sahl ibn Ḥunayf asked him, ‘Why did you remove it?’ He replied,
‘Because there were pictures on it and the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said you know what about them,’ Sahl said, ‘Did not the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, “except for markings on a garment”?’ He said, ‘Yes,
but it is more pleasing to me.’”
8 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad
from ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that she bought a cushion
which had pictures on it. When the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬saw it,

he stopped at the door and did not enter. She recognised
disapproval on his face and said, “Messenger of Allah, I turn in
repentance to Allah and His Messenger. What have I done wrong?”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “What is the meaning of this
cushion?” She answered, “I bought it for you to sit and recline on.”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ose who make such pictures
will be punished on the Day of Rising. ey will be told, ‘Bring to
life what you have created.’” en he added, “e angels do not
enter a house in which there are images.”

54.4 Eating lizards
9 Mālik related to me from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abd

ar-Raḥman ibn Abī Ṣa‘ṣa‘a that Sulaymān ibn Yasār said that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬entered the house of Maymūna bint alḤārith and there was a lizard in which there were eggs to eat.
‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās and Khālid ibn al-Walīd were with him. He
asked, “From where did you get this?” She replied, “My sister,
Huzayla bint al-Ḥārith, gave it to me.” He then told ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Abbās and Khālid ibn al-Walīd to eat. ey said, “Will you not eat,
Messenger of Allah?” He said, “ere are those who visit me from
Allah.” Maymūna said, “Messenger of Allah, shall we give you some
milk we have to drink?” He replied, “Yes.” When he drank, he
asked, “From where did you get this?” She said, “My sister, Huzayla,
gave it to me.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked, “Do you see your
slave-girl whom you asked me for permission to free? Give her to

716

your sister and bring her to your maternal relatives to take care of
her. at is better for you.”
10 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Abū Umāma ibn Sahl

ibn Ḥunayf from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās that Khālid ibn al-Walīd ibn
al-Mughīra entered the house of Maymūna, the wife of the Prophet
‫ﷺ‬, with the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he was brought a roasted
lizard. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬stretched out his hand toward it.
One of the women who was in Maymūna’s house said, “Tell the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬what he is about to eat.” Someone said, “It is
a lizard, Muḥammad.” He drew back his hand. Khālid asked, “Is it
unlawful, Messenger of Allah?” He answered, “No, but there were
none in my father’s land and I ﬁnd that I dislike them.”
Khālid added, “I chewed and ate it while the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
was looking.”
11 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār from ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Umar that a man called the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said,

“Messenger of Allah, what do you think about lizards?” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I do not eat them and I do not forbid
them.”

54.5 Concerning dogs
12 Mālik related to me from Yazīd ibn Khuṣayfa that as-Sā’ib ibn

Yazīd informed him that he heard Sufyān ibn Abī Zuhayr, who was
from the Azd Shanu’a tribe and among the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, speaking with some people who were at the
door of the mosque. He said, “I heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
say, ‘If anyone acquires a dog, which he does not use as a sheepdog
or for hunting, a qīrāṭ will be deducted from the reward of his good
deeds each day.” He was asked, “Did you hear this from the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ”?ﷺ‬He said, “Yes, by the Lord of this mosque.”
13 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever acquires a dog, other

717

than a sheepdog or hunting dog, will have two qīrāṭs deducted from
the reward of his good actions every day.”
14 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered dogs to be killed.

54.6 Concerning sheep
15 Mālik related to me from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e main source of

disbelief (kufr) lies towards the east. Boasting and pride are found in
the people who have horses and camels. e loud-mouthed people
are the people of the tents (the Bedouin). Tranquillity is found with
the people who have sheep.”
16 Mālik related to me from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān

ibn Ṣa‘ṣa‘a from his father from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Ṣa‘ṣa‘a from
his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “It will soon happen
that the best property of a Muslim will be sheep which he takes to
the peaks of the mountains and the valleys, ﬂeeing with his dīn
from trials.”
17 Mālik

related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from Ibn ‘Umar that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “No one should milk someone else’s
cow without permission. Would any of you like someone to come to
his apartment, break into his larder and take his food? e udders of
cows guard their food for their owners, so no one should milk
someone else’s cow without his permission.”
18 Mālik related to me that he had heard that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “ere is no Prophet who has not herded sheep,” and

someone asked, “You included, Messenger of Allah?” He said,
“Myself included.”

54.7 Mice falling into clariﬁed butter, and giving precedence to
food over the prayer

718

19 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ that one time as Ibn ‘Umar was

served his evening meal, he heard the recitation of the imām while
he was in his house and he did not hurry from his food until he had
ﬁnished what he needed.

20 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Ubaydullāh ibn

‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Utba ibn Mas‘ūd from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Abbās from
Maymūna, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, that the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬was asked about a mouse falling into clariﬁed butter. He said,
“Remove it and throw away what is around it.”

54.8 Guarding against ill luck
21 Mālik related to me from Abū Ḥāzim ibn Dīnār from Sahl ibn
Sa‘d as-Sā‘idī that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If it exists, it is

in a horse, a woman, and a house” meaning ill luck.

22 Mālik related to me from Mālik from Ibn Shihāb from Ḥamza

and Sālim, the sons of ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar, from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Ill luck is in a house, a
woman and a horse.”
23 Mālik related to me that Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd said, “A woman came to
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said, ‘Messenger of Allah, we moved

into a house when our number was great and our wealth was
abundant. Now our number has dwindled and the wealth has gone.’
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Leave it as blameworthy.’”

54.9 Names that are disliked
24 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked about a milk camel about to be milked, “Who is

going to milk this camel?” A man stood up. e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬asked, “What is your name?” e man said, “Murra (bitterness).”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to him, “Sit down.” en he said,
“Who will milk this one?” A man stood up and the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked, “What is your name?” He said, “Ḥarb (war).” e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Sit down.” en he said, “Who will
719

milk this camel?” A man stood up and the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said to him, “What is your name?” e man said, “Ya‘īsh (he lives).”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬told him, “Milk!”
25 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Umar ibn al-

Khaṭṭāb asked a man what his name was. He said, “Jamra (live
coals).” “e son of whom?” he asked. He replied, “Ibn Shihāb
(meteor, ﬂame).” “From whom?” He asked. He said, “From alḤuraqa (burning).” He asked, “Where do you live?” He replied, “At
Ḥarra an-Nār (lava-ﬁeld of the ﬁre).” “At which one of them?” he
asked?” He said, “At Dhāt Laẓā (one with ﬂames).” ‘Umar said, “Go
and look to your family – they have been burned.”
Yaḥyā added, “It was as ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb g said.”

54.10 Cupping and the reward of the cupper
26 Mālik related to me from Ḥumayd aṭ-Ṭawīl that Anas ibn Mālik
said, “e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was cupped. Abū Ṭayba cupped
him, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬ordered him to be given a ṣā‘ of

dates and ordered his family to lessen what he paid them for his
kitāba or kharāj.”

27 Mālik related to me that he heard that the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

said, “If there is a remedy that will reach the disease, then cupping
will reach it.”
28 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Ibn Muḥayyisa al-

Anṣārī, one of the Banū Ḥāritha, that he asked permission from the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬to give payment for cupping and he forbade
him to do so. He continued to ask and seek permission until he said,
“Feed the ones who drive your water-carrying camels” meaning
“your slaves.”

54.11 Concerning the East
29 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār that ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar said, “I saw the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬pointing at the east

720

and saying, ‘e cause of dissension (ﬁtna) is there. e cause of
dissension is there, from where the helpers of Shayṭān arise.”
30 Mālik related to me that he heard that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb

wanted to go to Iraq, and Ka‘b al-Aḥbar said to him, “Do not go
there, Amīr al-Mu’minīn. Nine-tenths of sorcery is there and it is
the place of rebellious jinn and the disease which the doctors are
unable to cure.”

54.12 Killing snakes and what is said about them
31 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from Abū Lubāba that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade killing snakes which were in houses.
32 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from Sā’iba, the female mawlā of
‘Ā’isha, that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬forbade killing the snakes

which were in the houses except those with two white stripes on
their back and two short ones. ey make a person go blind and
cause miscarriages in women.
33 Mālik related to me from Ṣayfī, the mawlā of Ibn Aﬂaḥ, that

Abū as-Sā’ib, the mawlā of Hishām ibn Zuhra, said, “I went to Abū
Sa‘īd al-Khudrī and found him praying. I sat to wait for him until
he ﬁnished the prayer. I heard a movement under a bed in his room,
and it was a snake. I got up to kill it and Abu Sa‘id gestured for me
to sit down. When he had ﬁnished, he pointed to a room in the
house and said, ‘Do you see this room?’ I replied, ‘Yes.’ He said,
‘ere was a youth in it who had just got married. He went with the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬to al-Khandaq (the Ditch which the
Muslims dug in the ﬁfth year of the Hijra to defend Madīna against
the Quraysh and their allies). While he was there, the youth came
and asked his permission, saying, “Messenger of Allah, give me
permission to return to my family.” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave
him permission and said, “Take your weapons with you, for I fear
the Banū Qurayẓa tribe. ey may harm you.”

721

‘e youth went to his family and found his wife standing between
the two doors. He lifted his spear to stab her as jealousy had been
aroused in him. She said, “Do not be hasty before you have gone in
and seen what is in your house.” He entered and found a snake
coiled up on his bed. He transﬁxed it with his spear and then went
out with it and set it upright in the house. e snake stirred on the
end of the spear and the youth fell dead. No one knew which of
them had died ﬁrst, the snake or the youth. e Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬was told about that and he said, “ere are jinn in Madīna who
have become Muslim. When you see one of them, call out to it for
three days. If it appears after that, then kill it, for it is a shayṭān.”’”

54.13 What to say on journeys
34 Mālik related to me that he heard that, when the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬set foot in the stirrup intending to travel, he would say, “In

the name of Allah. O Allah! You are my Companion in the journey
and my replacement in my family. O Allah! Shorten the earth for us
and make the journey easy for us. O Allah! I seek refuge with You
from the hardship of the journey and from returning to sorrow and
a distressing sight regarding property and family.”
Bismi’llāh. Allāhumma anta’ṣ-ṣāḥibu ﬁ’s-safari wa’l-khalīfatu ﬁ’lahl. Allāhumma’zwi lana’l-arḍa wa hawwin ‘alayna’s-safar.
Allāhumma innī a‘ūdhu bika min wa‘thā’i’s-safari wa min ka’ābati’lmunqalabi wa min sū’il-manẓari ﬁ’l-māli wa’l-ahl.
Mālik related to me from a reliable source of his from Ya‘qūb ibn
‘Abdullāh al-Ashajj from Busr ibn Sa‘īd from Sa‘d ibn Abī Waqqāṣ
from Khawla bint Ḥakīm that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“Whoever dismounts to rest in a place should say, ‘I seek refuge
with the complete words of Allah from the evil of what He created’,
and nothing will harm him until he remounts.”

54.14 Travelling alone in the case of men and women
722

35 Mālik related to me from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Ḥarmala from

‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb from his father from his grandfather that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “One rider is a shayṭān. Two riders are
two shayṭāns, and three are a riding party.”

36 Mālik related to me from ‘Abd ar-Raḥmān ibn Ḥarmala that
Sa‘īd ibn al-Musayyab heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say,

“Shayṭān concerns himself with one and two. When there are three,
he does not concern himself with them.”

37 Mālik related to me from Sa‘īd ibn Abī Sa‘īd al-Maqburī from
Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “It is not lawful

for a woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day to travel the
distance of a day and a night without a man who is her maḥram.”

54.15 How to behave on journeys
38 Mālik related to me from Abū ‘Ubayd, the mawlā of Sulaymān

ibn ‘Abd al-Malik from Khālid ibn Ma‘dan who attributed it to the
Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, “Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, is kind and loves
kindness. Kindness pleases Him and He helps you with kindness as
long as it is not misplaced. When you ride dumb beasts, stop them
in their stopping-places, and quicken their pace when the land is
barren. Travel by night, because the land is travelled faster at night
than it is during the day. Beware of pitching tents on the road for it
is the path of animals and the abode of snakes.”
39 Mālik related to me from Sumayy, the mawlā of Abū Bakr, from
Abū Ṣaliḥ from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,

“Travelling is a portion of torment. It denies you your sleep, food
and drink. When you have accomplished your purpose, you should
hurry back to your family.”

54.16 e command to be kind to slaves
40 Mālik related to me that he heard that Abū Hurayra said that the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A slave should have normal food and

723

clothing, and he is only obliged to do such work as he is capable of
doing.”
41 Mālik related to me that he heard that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb

went to the villages every Saturday. If he found a slave doing work
which he was not capable of doing he lightened it for him.
42 Mālik related to me from his paternal uncle, Abū Suhayl ibn

Mālik, that his father heard ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Aﬀān say in a khuṭba, “Do
not oblige a slave-girl to earn money unless she has a skill. If you
oblige her to do that, she will earn money by prostitution. Do not
oblige a child to earn money. If he does not ﬁnd it, he will steal.
Pardon, since Allah will pardon you, and you must feed them good
food.”

54.17 A slave and his reward
43 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When a slave gives good counsel

to his master and worships Allah correctly, he has his reward twice
over.”

44 Mālik related to me that he heard that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb saw

a female slave belonging to ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar ibn al-Khattāb. She
was dressed in the way that a free woman dresses. He went to his
daughter, Hafṣa, and said, “Did I not see your brother’s slave-girl
dressed in the way that a free woman dresses walking among the
people and causing trouble?” ‘Umar disapproved of that.

724

55. e Oath of Allegiance
55.1 About the oath of allegiance
1 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “When we took an oath of allegiance with him to hear
and obey, the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said to us, ‘In what you are
able.’”
2 Mālik related to me from Muḥammad ibn al-Munkadir that
Umayma bint Ruqayqa said, “I went to the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬

with the women who took an oath of allegiance with him in Islam.
ey said, ‘Messenger of Allah! We take a pledge with you not to
associate anything with Allah, not to steal, not to commit adultery,
not to kill our children, nor to produce any lie that we have devised
between our hands and feet, and not to disobey you in what is
known.’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘In what you can do and
are able.’”
Umayma continued, “ey said, ‘Allah and His Messenger are more
merciful to us than ourselves. Come, let us give our hands to you,
Messenger of Allah!’ e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, said, ‘I do not
shake hands with women. My word to a hundred women is like my
word to one woman.’”
3 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar wrote to ‘Abd al-Malik ibn Marwān, making an oath of
allegiance. He wrote, “In the name of Allah, the All-Merciful, the
Most Merciful. To the slave of Allah, ‘Abd al-Malik, the Amīr alMu’minīn. Peace be upon you. I praise Allah to you. ere is no god
but Him. I acknowledge your right to my hearing and my obedience
according to the sunna of Allah and the sunna of His Prophet in
what I am able.”

725

56. Speech
56.1 Disliked speech
1 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If a man says to his

Muslim brother, ‘O unbeliever!’ it is true about one of them.”

2 Mālik related to me from Suhayl ibn Abū Ṣāliḥ from his father
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “When you

hear a man say, ‘e people are ruined,’ he himself is the most
ruined of them all.”
3 Mālik related to me from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Let none of you

complain about time, for Allah is time.””

4 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd that ‘Īsā ibn Maryam

encountered a pig on the road. He said to it, “Go in peace.”
Somebody asked, “Do you say this to a pig?” ‘Īsā replied, “I fear lest
I accustom my tongue to evil speech.”

56.2 e order to be mindful in speech
5 Mālik related to me from Muḥammad ibn ‘Amr ibn ‘Alqama from

his father from Bilāl ibn al-Ḥārith al-Muzanī that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “A man says what is pleasing to Allah and he does not
suspect that it will have the result that it does, and Allah will write
for him His good pleasure for it until the day when he meets Him.
And a man says what excites the wrath of Allah and he does not
suspect that it will have the result that it does, and Allah will write
His wrath for him for it until the day when he meets Him.”
6 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār that Abū Ṣāliḥ as-

Sammān informed him that Abū Hurayra said, “Truly a man utters
words to which he attaches no importance, and by them he falls into
726

the Fire of Hell, and truly a man utters words to which he attaches
no importance, and by them Allah raises him into the Garden.”

56.3 Disliked speech and speech without the mention of Allah
7 Mālik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that ‘Abdullāh ibn

‘Umar said, “Two men from the east stood up and spoke, and
people were amazed at their eloquence. e Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬
said, ‘Some eloquence is sorcery,’ and he said, ‘Part of eloquence is
sorcery.’”
8 Mālik related to me that ‘Īsā ibn Maryam used to say, “Do not

speak much without mentioning Allah because you will harden your
hearts. A hard heart is far from Allah, but you do not know. Do not
look at the wrong actions of people as if you were lords. Look to
your wrong actions as if you were slaves. Some people are aﬄicted
by wrong action and some people are protected from it. Be merciful
to the people of aﬄiction and praise Allah for His protection.”
9 Mālik related to me that ‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, sent a

message to one of her family after the evening prayer, saying, “Will
you not allow the recording angel to rest?”

56.4 Backbiting
10 Mālik related to me from al-Walīd ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Sayyād that

al-Muṭṭalib ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Ḥantab al-Makhzūmī informed him
that a man asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “What is backbiting?”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “It is to mention about a man what
he does not want to hear.” He said, “Messenger of Allah, even if it is
true?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “If you utter something false,
then it is slander.”

56.5 What is feared from the tongue
11 Mālik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yasār
that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever Allah protects from

the evil of two things will enter the Garden?” A man said,
727

“Messenger of Allah, do not tell us!” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was
silent. en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬repeated what he had said
the ﬁrst time. e man said to him, “Do not tell us, Messenger of
Allah!” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was silent. en the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said the same thing again. e man said, “Do not tell us,
Messenger of Allah!” en the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said the same
thing again. en the man began to say what he had said previously
and a man at his side silenced him. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“Whomever Allah protects from the evil of two things will enter the
Garden. ey are what is between his jaws and what is between his
legs, what is between his jaws and what is between his legs, what is
between his jaws and what is between his legs.”
12 Mālik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam from his father that

‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb came upon Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq pulling his
tongue. ‘Umar said to him, “Stop, may Allah forgive you!” Abū Bakr
replied, “is has brought me to dangerous places.”

56.6 Two people conversing to the exclusion of another
13 Mālik related to me from ‘Abdullāh ibn Dīnār, saying, “‘Abdullāh

ibn ‘Umar and I were at the house of Khālid ibn ‘Uqba, who was
away at the market. A man came who wanted to speak to ‘Abdullāh
ibn ‘Umar and I was the only other person present. ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar called another man so that we were four and said to me and
the man whom he had called, ‘Go a little way oﬀ together because I
heard the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬say, “Two should not converse to
the exclusion of a third.”’”
14 Mālik related to me from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn ‘Umar that
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Two must not converse secretly to

the exclusion of a third person.”

56.7 Truthfulness and lying
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Ṣafwān ibn Sulaym that a
man asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬, “Can I lie to my wife,

728

Messenger of Allah?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬answered, “ere
is no good in lying.” e man said, “Messenger of Allah! Shall I
make her a promise and tell her?” e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said,
“It will not be held against you.”
16 Mālik related to me that he heard that ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd used

to say, “You must tell the truth. Truthfulness leads to right action.
Right action leads to the Garden. Beware of lying. Lying leads to
corruption and corruption leads to the Fire. Do you not see that it is
said, ‘He speaks the truth and acts rightly,’ and ‘He lies and is
corrupt.’”
17 Mālik related to me that he heard that someone said to Luqmān,

“What has brought you to what we see?” meaning his high rank.
Luqmān replied, “Truthful speech, fulﬁlling the trust and leaving
what does not concern me.”
18 Mālik related to me that he heard that ‘Abdullāh ibn Mas‘ūd used

to say, “A slave of Allah continues to lie and a black spot grows in
his heart until all his heart becomes black. en he is written in the
sight of Allah among the liars.”
Mālik related to me that Ṣafwān ibn Sulaym said, “e
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was asked, ‘Can a believer be a coward?’ He
said, ‘Yes.’ He was asked, ‘Can a believer be a miser?’ He replied,
‘Yes.’ He was asked, ‘Can a believer be a liar?’ He said, ‘No.’”
19

56.8 Squandering property and being two-faced
20 Mālik related to me from Suhayl ibn Abī Ṣāliḥ from his father
from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Allah is

pleased with three things from you, and He is angry with three
things from you. He is pleased that you worship Him and do not
associate anything with Him, and that you take hold of the rope of
Allah altogether and that you give good counsel to the one to whom
Allah gives command over you. He is angry with you for gossip,
squandering property and asking too many questions.”
729

21 Mālik related to me from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “One of the most evil

of people is the two-faced person who shows one face to some
people and another face to other people.”

56.9 Punishing the many for the actions of the few
22 Mālik related to me that he had heard that Umm Salama, the
wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, said, “Messenger of Allah! Shall we be

destroyed while there are people who are right-acting among us?”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Yes, if there is much wickedness.”

23 Mālik related to me that Ismā‘īl ibn Abī Ḥakīm heard ‘Umar ibn

‘Abd al-‘Azīz say, “Some say that Allah, the Blessed, the Exalted,
will not punish the many for the wrong action of the few. However,
when the objectionable action is committed openly, then they all
deserve to be punished.”

56.10 About people with taqwā
24 Mālik related to me from Isḥāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Ṭalḥa that

Anas ibn Mālik said, “When I was going out with ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb to visit an orchard, I heard him talking to himself. ere
was a wall between us and he was inside the garden. He said,
“‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, Amīr al-Mu’minīn! Well done! Well done!
By Allah, fear Allah or He will punish you!”
25 Mālik said that he heard that al-Qāsim ibn Muḥammad used to

say, “I have seen the people (i.e. the Companions), and they were
not impressed by speech.” Mālik said, “He meant that only action
and deeds would be looked at, not words.”

56.11 What to say when it thunders
26 Mālik related to me that ‘Āmir ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn az-Zubayr

would stop speaking when he heard thunder and say, “Glory be to
the One whom the thunder gloriﬁes with His praise and the angels
730

from fear of Him” (Subḥāna’llādhi yusabbihu’r-ra‘du bi-ḥamdihi
wa’l-malā’ikatu min khīfatihi).

56.12 e legacy of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬
27 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Urwa ibn az-Zubayr

from ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, that when the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬died, the wives of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, wanted to send ‘Uthmān ibn
‘Aﬀān to Abū Bakr aṣ-Ṣiddīq to ask him about their inheritance
from the Messenger of Allah ‫ﷺ‬. ‘Ā’isha said to them, “Did the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬not say, ‘No one inherits from us. What we
leave is ṣadaqa.’”
28 Mālik related to me from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “My inheritance is not

divided up by the dinar. What I leave, apart from the maintenance
of my wives and provision for my servant, is ṣadaqa.”

731

57. Jahannam
57.1 Description of Jahannam
1 Mālik related to me from Abū az-Zinād from al-A‘raj from Abū
Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “e ﬁre of the

descendants of Ādam which they kindle is a seventieth part of the
ﬁre of Jahannam.” ey said, “Messenger of Allah, this ﬁre is
certainly enough.” he said, “at ﬁre is sixty-nine times greater.”
2 Mālik related to me from his paternal uncle, Abū Suhayl ibn

Mālik, from his father that Abū Hurayra said, “Do you think that it
is red like this ﬁre of yours? It is blacker than tar.”

732

58. Ṣadaqa
58.1 Stimulation of desire for ṣadaqa
1 Mālik related to me from Yaḥyā ibn Sa‘īd from Abū al-Ḥubāb Sa‘d
ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Whoever gives

ṣadaqa from good earnings – and Allah only accepts the good – it is
as if he placed it in the palm of the All-Merciful to raise it, as one of
you might raise his foal or young camel until it is like the
mountain.”
2 Mālik related to me that Ishāq ibn ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Ṭalḥa heard

Anas ibn Mālik say, “Abū Ṭalḥa had the greatest amount of property
in palm-trees among the Ansar in Madīna. e dearest of his
properties to him was Bayraḥā’ which was in front of the mosque.
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬used to go and drink from the pleasant
water which was in it.”
Anas continued, “When the āyat was revealed: ‘You will not attain
true goodness until you give of what you love’ (3:92) Abū Ṭalḥa went
to the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and said, ‘Messenger of Allah! Allah,
the Blessed, the Exalted, has said, “You will not obtain true
goodness until you give of what you love.” e property which I love
the best is Bayraḥā’. It is ṣadaqa for Allah. I hope for its good and
for it to be stored up with Allah. Place it wherever you wish,
Messenger of Allah.’
“e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘Well done! at is property
which proﬁts! at is property which proﬁts! I have heard what you
said about it and I think that you should give it to your relatives.’
Abū Ṭalḥa said, ‘I will do it, Messenger of Allah!’ Abū Ṭalḥa
therefore divided it among his relatives and the children of his
paternal uncle.”

733

3 Mālik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that the Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Give to a beggar even if he comes on a horse.”
4 Mālik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Amr ibn Mu‘ādh

al-Ashhalī al-Anṣārī that his grandmother said, “e Messenger of
Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, ‘O believing women! Let none of you despise giving
to her neighbour even if it is only a roasted sheep’s trotter.’”
5 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that a beggar asked
‘Ā’isha, the wife of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬, for something while she was

fasting and there was only a loaf of bread in her house. She said to
her female client, “Give it to him.” e client protested, “You will
not have anything to break your fast with.” ‘Ā’isha repeated, “Give it
to him,” so she did so. When evening came, the people of a house
or a man who did not usually give to them, gave them a sheep and
some food to go with it. ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, called her
client and said, “Eat from this. is is better than your loaf of
bread.”
6 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik said, “I heard that a beggar asked

for food from ‘Ā’isha, Umm al-Mu’minīn, while she had some
grapes. She told someone to take him one grape. He began to look
in amazement. ‘Ā’isha said, “Are you amazed? How many atoms’
weights do you see in this grape?” (referring to Qur’ān 99:7)

58.2 Refraining from asking
7 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from ‘Aṭā’ ibn Yazīd al-

Laythī from Abū Sa‘īd al-Khudrī that some people of the Ansar
asked the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and he gave to them. en they
asked him again and he gave to them until he used up what he had.
en he said, “What wealth I have I will not hoard from you.
Whoever abstains, Allah will help him. Whoever tries to be
independent, Allah will enrich him. Whoever tries to be patient,
Allah will give him patience, and no one is given a better or vaster
gift than patience.”

734

8 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Nāﬁ‘ from ‘Abdullāh ibn
‘Umar that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said from the minbar when

mentioning ṣadaqa and refraining from asking, “e upper hand is
better than the lower hand. e upper hand is the one which
expends and the lower one is the one which asks.”

9 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’
ibn Yasār that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent a gift to ‘Umar ibn alKhaṭṭāb and ‘Umar returned it. e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬asked,

“Why did you return it?” He replied, “Messenger of Allah, didn’t
you tell us that it is better for us not to take anything from anyone?”
e Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “at is by asking. Provision which
Allah gives you is not the same as asking.” ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb
said, “By the One in whose hand my self is, I will not ask anything
from anyone, and anything that comes to me without my asking for
it, I will accept.”
10 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Abū az-Zinād from alA‘raj from Abū Hurayra that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “By

Him in whose hand my self is! To take your rope and gather
ﬁrewood on your back is better for you than that you come to a man
to whom Allah has give some of His favour and ask him and then
he either gives something to you or refuses.”
11 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from ‘Aṭā’

ibn Yasār that a man of the Banū Asad said, “ My family and I
dismounted to rest at Baqī‘. My family said to me, ‘Go to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and ask him for something that we can eat,’
and they began to mention what they needed. I went to the
Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬and found that a man was asking for
something, and the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬was saying, ‘I do not
have anything to give you.’ e man turned away from him in anger,
saying, ‘By my life! You give to whomever you wish!’ e Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬remarked, ‘He is angry with me because I do not have
anything to give him. Whoever asks you for something while he has
an ūqiya or its equivalent has asked with importunity.’”
735

e man continued, “I told myself that a camel we had was worth
more than an ūqiya.’ (Mālik explained that an ūqiya was forty
dirhams) So I returned without having asked him for anything, and
the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬sent me barley and raisins later on. He
gave us from his share until Allah, the Mighty, the Majestic, gave us
relief.”
12 Yaḥyā related to me that Mālik heard al-‘Alā’ ibn ‘Abd ar-

Raḥmān say, “Ṣadaqa does not decrease property, and Allah only
increases a person in worth for his restraint, and no one is humble
but that Allah raises him.”
Mālik said, “I do not know whether this ḥadīth goes back to the
Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬or not.”

58.3 What is disliked in ṣadaqa
13 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that the Messenger
of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬said, “Ṣadaqa to the family of Muḥammad is not lawful.

It is only people’s impurities.”

14 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from ‘Abdullāh ibn Abī Bakr
from his father that the Messenger of Allah ‫ ﷺ‬gave a man from the

Banū ‘Abd al-Ashhal charge over some ṣadaqa. When he came to
ask him for some camels from the ṣadaqa, the Messenger of Allah
‫ ﷺ‬was so angry that the anger showed in his face. One way in
which anger could be recognised in his face was that his eyes
became red. en he said, “is man has asked me for what is not
good for me or for him. If I refuse it, I hate to refuse. If I give it to
him, I will give him what is not good for me or for him.” e man
said, “Messenger of Allah! I will never ask you for any of it.”
15 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam that his

father said, “‘Abdullāh ibn al-Arqam said, ‘Show me a riding-camel
which the Amīr al-Mu’minīn can give me to use.’ I said, ‘Yes, one of
the ṣadaqa camels.’ ‘Abdullāh ibn al-Arqam said, ‘Would you want a
stout man on a hot day to wash for you what is under his lower
736

garment and its folds and then give it to you to drink?’ I was angry
and said, ‘May Allah forgive you! Why do you say such things to
me?’ ‘Abdullāh ibn al-Arqam said, ‘Ṣadaqa is the impurities of
people which they wash oﬀ themselves.’”

737

59. Knowledge
59.1 Seeking Knowledge
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik that he heard that Luqmān the

Sage made his will and counselled his son, saying, “My son! Sit with
the learned men and keep close to them. Allah gives life to the
hearts with the light of wisdom as Allah gives life to the dead earth
with the abundant rain of the sky.”

738

60 e Supplication of the Unjustly
Wronged
60.1 Supplication of someone unjustly wronged
1 Yaḥyā related to me from Mālik from Zayd ibn Aslam from his

father that ‘Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb gave a mawlā of his called Ḥunayy
charge over the ḥimā. He said, “Ḥunayy! Do not harm the people.
Fear the supplication of the wronged for the wronged person is
answered. Let the one with a small herd of camels and the one with
a small herd of sheep enter, but be wary of the livestock of Ibn ‘Awf
and the livestock of Ibn ‘Aﬀān. If their livestock is destroyed, they
will bring their children to me crying, ‘Amīr al-Mu’minīn! Amīr alMu’minīn!’ Shall I neglect them? Water and pasturage are of less
value to me than gold and silver. By Allah, they think that I have
wronged them. is is their land and their water. ey fought for it
in the Jāhiliyya and became Muslims on it in Islam. By Him in
whose hand my soul is! Were it not for the mounts, which I give to
be ridden in the way of Allah, I would not have turned a span of
their land into ḥimā.”

739

61. e Names of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬
61.1 e names of the Prophet ‫ﷺ‬
1 Mālik related to me from Ibn Shihāb from Muḥammad ibn
Jubayr ibn Muṭ‘im that the Prophet ‫ ﷺ‬said, “I have ﬁve names. I am

Muḥammad. I am Aḥmad. I am al-Māḥī (the eﬀacer) by whom
Allah eﬀaces disbelief. I am al-Ḥāshir (the gatherer) before whom
people are gathered. I am al-‘Āqib (the last).”
