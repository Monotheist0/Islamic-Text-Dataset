Translator's Preface
This book is an English translation of sheikh professor Sauh Al-Fawian's
~ I ..i o;,-Ut A Summll:ry of Islamic J11r/spn1de,1ce: Dar Al• · Asimah,
2001 (ISBN:3967/21), Oll:t' main aim ln providing the English translation is
pmpagating the true Da•wah thatderlves from Allah's Book and His Messe11ger's
Su.nnah. This is a duty t bat every Muslim should cherish, Allah says: 'ilnd let
there be /arising] from yo11 a nation b1viti11g to [all thq/ is] goed, e11jof11l11g
what is right a11d forblddllig what is wrong, and those will be tile succe.ssful."
(Alu ' lmrrui: 104). With thlsfn mind, this translated work is, then, a humble
response to our realization of a great responsibility to give the English speaking
reader access to rfch Islamic Jiuisprudence Literature that simply focuses on
the rules of jurisprudence and ,(hcir proofs from the Qur'an, Sunnah and the
practice of the Righteous Salaf' in addition to the opinions of the scholars of
jurisprudence on controversial issues a6 well as the proofs they quote in support
of their opinions. Jn doiog so, we have left no stone unturned to make sure
that the final .copy of a translated book meets a specific high quality .standard
that would convey the same mc:aning intended by the author and wcpresS'ed in
the original source text. [n effoct, we have tried ta set a balance between tl\e
originality of thought and :the c1ature of the style of language.
To attain this alm, our work (in this book and others) exhibits cer.tain
disti11ctive features, namely. the process of translation, die style, the attention
paid to the sociolinguistic asp~cts (i.e., transliteration, glossary and endnotes).
We,touch upon these features in the following section.

1.PROCESS
Before reachif!g the publls;her, our work goes through a developmental
process lo guarantee that the fl[nal version of the translated book is as perfect

as can be:.
ln effect, this process com:m~nces wit.b the first-hand trnnslatlon, which
is done by some very carefully chosen t ranslalors who are native-speakets
of Anibic and have a native-like command of the t.irget language The main
,principle tliat governs the translation process is 1that the translator is after
integrity, With integrity as tbe main target, lhe translators would not be
tempted to impose their own id<Y.IS on the·text nor would they gloss over the
difficult par-agraphs insiead olf taking the trouble to find out what is really
meant. Translators would do their best to convey both the content and spirit
of the ociginal

'frnn.~aro/s l,•rcfoce

The ne:<I ~tep of the process is undert'aken by a revi.~er who has a high
profile in translating religious texts 11nd is -uware of the. traps th~t one might
fall into. In addition, he has a thorough religious background knowledge that
eaables him to detect any unintended error in conveyingthe meaning.
Tbe revised version is then submitted to a picky· editor who is well -versed
in the target language and has substantlal knowledge of Islamic. Scieuces.
Finally, the eclited version is banded over to a native-speaker of Engllsh
who is knowledgeable in Islamic Sciences to make sure that the tr-anslali.o n is
readable and mea11111gful IO the l.lrget audience.

2.STYLE
A 11arunil outgrowth of the processes adopted in translation is rhe style
!!1e final version h.t~ come 01-11 in. The intended meaning of the author has
been conveyed 1n 11 style i•hat is authentic and as close to the original as
posslble. Tt renlly sounds authentic: So n'dtural that !he work does not read
like a lrnnslation, but an indigenous piece of writing. The translatio~ vefliion
is marked by remarkable variety aad richness as well as tremendous skiU at
-writing within formal religious genre, Moreover, attempts have been made to
have it simple. dear and appealing to the target audience,

3..ATTENTION TO SOCJOLINGUISTIC ASPECTS
As a way to fill up the gnp caused by s!lciolinguistic differences between
the two languages (s,,urce laogi,uge and tMgei lru,guage), our work include.~
some additional featu~es (i.e., transliteration., glossary and endnotes) that
would guarantee betkr understanding of the concepts llnd ideas that miglit
confuse the English speakfng reader due to the lack of schemata in this field.

A- TRANSLITERATION SYSTEM

In the process of trru:islation, we made a serious attempt to limit the use of
\ranslit1'tated Ar;1bk terms (see table in p. X) .to tbe (ollowing two situations:
i) There is no Engli,;h expression th11t ca11 reflect the same meaning as the
original term.
ii) The Arabic term is of sud, importance that it is cssentfal to fumiliarize
the reader with it.

B-GLOSSARY
.At the end of the bool<, we h~ve jududed a glossary defining common
Arabic terms that fulfill the above criteria. Included to the glos,·«rt al6o are
terms thaf need furfher explanation,

A Summary ofl,lamic J11ri1pn,dt:110e

->.Vii

C-ENDNOTES

1n the endnotes, we have given clear and concise e.-cplanations of the terms
that are not cleat-or understandable to the t,1rget reader due to.the sociolinguistic
differences in ,1ddition to the colllmentaries written by the author hirnself,
l,u:rthet.morc, ench l!.adlth mentioned i n the text uf the book is ascribed If\ the
endnotes to the book it is quoted from.
D· lNDlCES
To F,icilitlll:e the process of going through the book and save. the reader's
time, we have foduded r:wo ,indiices. namely, subject index imd name ind(lx. So.
if the reader is looklng for spedflc information or a given nome, s/he would go
directly to the indox to find the page munber.

4. QUR'AN TRANSLATION
The Qur'~n is AUah's exact words. These words can never ever be e11actly
translared into other (anguag1;is because of, among other things, possible
misinterpret~tions and limited human understanding. What is foUowl'Ci in
the book is to trnnslate the meanings as understood ·by Muslim scholars. We
sol~!)' depended on the ' Tra11slatio11 ofthe Mea111iig oft/re Qur~,,: translated
by Saheeh Intemationai - Riy•odh nnd published by Abulqasi.m Publishing
Hou$e. \"i'hen a verse is cited, the E;ngl.isb interpretation ls given betwten
quotation marks "... ~• in indernred, hold, und italil; ized format. 'fhe location
of the Qur'anic verse, the nam,e of the sura is given below to the verse :Is it is
illustrated in the example below,
~11d We sent 1101 befor,, you ,my messenger except tl1at We
re1•ealed to him thlll tJ11m1 is no deity except Me, so worship Me!'
{AJ-Anbya': 25)

S. HADITH TRANSLA1'ION
Siniilady, when we cite a /Jodlt/1, we mention the book of flodllh it is
quoted from in addltlon to its number in the book. Purthe<, the trnuslation of
Pwphetic !J.odith is represented in ail indented format, itali.cized and between
~uot·ation marks • .. _;, as i t i~illiustrated in the example below:
"Do 1wt drfnk i 11 gold or ,ilver vessels nor ea/ i11 .similar bowls
(i.e. bowls made of go/a' or silver), for they belong to them (tire
disbelievers) /11 //tis world and to 115 ill tl1e 'Hereafte1:"

PART

INTRODUCTION

All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and peace be upon our
Prophet Muhammad, the Seal of prophets, and upon his household, his
Companions, and whoever follows their example with good conduct until
the Day of Recompense.
To commence, this is a brief account of juristic issues, in which views are
provided with proots from the Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition) and the Qur'an.
I have previously delivered the content of this book in the form of sermons
broadcast on radio, and I have been Tepeatedly asked by the audience to
redeliver them, and to publish them as a treatise, for the sake of continuous
benefit, if Allah wills. In fact, I never intended this book to be published when it
was under preparation, but in response to the wish of many people, I reviewed
it, arranged its contents, and presented it to be published. And here it is now,
gentle reader, between your hands; whatever correctness and benefit you find
therein are out of the Grace of Allah, Alone, and whatever mistakes you find
are mine, and I seek the forgiveness of Allah for them.

their example with .good conduct until the Day of ll,ecompense.
To commence, under~tanding the religion is considered one of the best
deeds, and a sign o(goodhess. The Prophet {PBUH) says:

"If Allah wants to do good.for a perso11, He 111akes l1im understand
the reltgio11."'
This is because comprehending the r~ligion leads to useful knowle,;lge
upon wliioh righteous deeds depeod Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"lt is He Who has sent His Messenge1· with guid,mce a,ui the
religion of truth ..."
(Qur'am Al-Fath: 28)

''Guidanc~• here refers to useful knowledge. and "the re.ligionof truth"
ls that which leads to cl.ghteous deeds. Besides, Allah commanded the
Prophet (PBUH) to invoke him for more knowiedge; Allah , Exalted be
He, said:

"... A11d say, 'My Lord, i11crease irie in k11owledge-'"
(Qur'an: 'rah~: I 14)
AJ-HMii, Jbn Hajar comments that the aforesaid Qur'a nic: verse,''. .. And
sa)~ 'My lord, increase me in knowledge,'" is a dear indication of the merit and
excellenGe of knowledge, for Allah never commanded f-lls Prophet {PBUH)
to invoke Him for more of anything other than knmvledge'. The Prophet
(PBU H) used to refer to the assemblies wherein µse.ful knowledge is taught as
"The Gardens of Paradise," nnd he (P BUH) .stated that "Men ofkmnviedge are
the inheritor; ofprophets."

There i,rno doubt that before one starts doing something one should know
how to perform It in the best way, so as iu pcrfortn it well to harves~ its desired
fruits. Likewise, it is by no means reasonable that one starts woe.shipping one's
Lord - the way through which one~ salvation from Hellfire and admltt:u1ce to
Paradise are gained - without having due, knowledge.
As such, people are divided into three categories regarding knowltl9-ge
and deeds,

T!ie first category is represented ln those who combine useful knowledge
along with righteous deed~. TI1meare the ones whom Allah has gUided
to the $Ir.tight path; the path,of lhose upon whom Allan has bestowed
favor of the prophets, ,he steadfast affirmers of truth, the martyrs and
the righteous,, and excellent irtdeed are these as companions.
The s~cond category is represented in those who learn useful k11owledge
but do not actllCcordingJy: Those are theooes whu have evoked Ailah's
a11ger, like the Jews and whoever foilows their footsteps,
The third category is represented 111 those who act ·w1tliout tiaving
knov.~edge. Th.ose are the ones whu are aslrdy, namely the Christians
and their likes,
These three categories are mentioned in the Sura of Al,Fatillah (the
Opening Chapter of the Quran), wh1ch we recite in eve,r y rak 'alt (unit 1) f
prayer) of our prayers:
''Gqide ,is to tire sfraigl1t p11rh - the path of those upon whom
You l1ave bestowed fm1or. 1mt of tbose who have evoked {Youd
anger or of/l1ose wl10 are t1$1rriy,"
{Qar'an: AI-Fatihah: 6-7)

In hls i"terpretatioD of die aJ'oresaid verses oftbe Sura of Al~Ffitib.ah,
Sheikh Muhammad Ibo· Abdnl-Wahhab (may Allah have n:ieccy on him)
has stated:

"T/w sd10/ars me,mt in '/he 'ill:l'Se 1h111 reads. 'those who have evoked

th~ aforesaid verses) seeki11g His refuge again.it them?! Are they not
3
aware tlrnt they tl1us a.sume evil about Allah?/"
This shows Ihe wisdom behind the obligation of recitihg this great Sura
(i.e., Al-Filtihah) in every rak 'ah of our prayers (whether obligatory or
su,p~rerogatory). ~ is· be~-ausc this sura cont ains many tireat secrets, among
them is the great Qur'anic inyocation that reads, ''Gi,ide 11s tq the straigl1I p.11th
- lne path of those upim wl,0111 You have bestowed favor, not of #,ose wlio
have evoked (Your/ anger or of tl,o.se who are a~tray." (Qur'ao: Al-.F~tihab:
6-7} Through this invocation, we ask Alfah to guide us to follow the conduct
and the way of the people who have oseful Im owledge and per form righteous
deeds, which ls the wny co solvnclon in both this world and the Hereafter. We
also lnvoke Him to safeguard us from the pathway.of the ones astray, who have
neglected either the righteous deeds or the useful knowledge.
Thus, we could argue that useful knowledge is that derived from the
Qur;an and the S111rnah (Prophetic Tradition). ll is gained by means of deep
understanding and comprehension of both, which can be achieved through
the help of religious instructors or scholars. This can also be achievea through
the hooks of exegesis of ll\e Qur'aa and those of J::ifl,#t11, as well as the books
of juri sprudence and those 9f Arabic grammar - the lan.guage in which the
Qur'an h:as been revealed Such books an.• the best means of comprehendln_g
the Q ur'an and the S 11n11Qh.

So as to pe~form the a~ts of worship so perfectly, you s'hoold. dea1r Muslim
brother, rleam what leads to the perfection of your performance of these
various atts of worship, such as Prayer, Pastin.g and Hajj (Pilgrimage). You
should 111s0 be aware of the rulings on Zaka/1' as well as the rulings on ,t he
dealings t hat concern you, so as to make use of what Allah has made I.awful
for you and avoid what He has made unlawful. You $'h ould observe this to
ensure that the money yon earn and the food you eat ate lawfully obtained, in
order to be one of those whose supplications are granted by Allah.In fact, you
have to know about all these matters, and this co11ld be,eastly achieved, Allah
·willing, provided that you have resolute dcterminarion and sincere intention.
So, be 1--een on reading useful relevant books, and .keep in touch with religious
scholars to ask them about whatever ruling you arc. in doubt about and to be
acquainted with the ruliugs of your religion.

In addition, you should take 1111 intere.~t i11 .mending religious symposiums
~nd leCtl!fes delivered al mosques and the like, listening to the broadcast
religious programs, and reading religious mag~ines ,and p,.iblications. If you
concern ,yourself wlth :such good actlvifies, your religious knowledge will
increase, and your insight wsll be en11ghtened.
Also, do not forget, dear brother, that knowledge increases and grows wheu
it is practically applied. Thus, if your deeds are according to your knowledge.
Allab surely will increase your knowledge. This corresponds witl1 the maxim
stating, ".He whose dsedi are done in accordance with his knowledge, Allah
will bestow upon him the knowledge of that which he has no knowledge
abou~ This is confirmed by the Glorious Qur'anic verse that reads:
''. .. And fear Allalr. And Allah teaches you. And Allah is KJ1owi11g
ofall tilings!'
(Qur'rui: Al-Baqarah: 282)

In fact. the worthiest thing to spend your time on is seeking knowiedge,
for which the people of good judgment compete.. It is rhrol!gh knowledge that
hearts maintain living and deeds are purified.
Allah, Exalted be 1-'f"JS Words and Glorified be His Attributes, praise~ the
scl1olar~ wl10 act in ~ccordance with theirknowledg!!. and states their elevated
degrees, as He mentions in His Glorious Book, the Qur'an:

Allah, Exalted be !:ie, also says:

who were given knowledge, by degrees. A11d Allp/1 Is Acqijal11te/f.

{Qur'an: Al -Mujadilah: IJ \

So, Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, shows the merit of those given
knowledge along With faith, and tells us that Ht' is Acquainted with and
Aware of what we do. Thus, Allah -shows us the necei.-sity of combining both
know1edge and righteous deeds, and tells us that both have to be Qll! of one's
sincere faith and fear of Him, Glortlied be He.
In accordance with the Qur'ank duty of cooperating in righteousness

Finally, we invoke Allah to bestow aseful knowledge upon all of us, and to
guide us to the righteous deeds. We also invoke Him, Glorified and Exalted
be He, to make us see the truth as it really is, and guide us to follow it, o.nd to
see fulsehood as it reaily is, and gr.mt us the ability to avoid il, He is Hearing

Trade! Transactions

Allah, in His Noble Book,, the Qur'an, and the Prophet (PBUH) through
his honorable Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition), pointed out the rulings on
transactions because of people's need for them; people in general need food,
clothes, houses, vehicles and other necessities of life in addition to different
luxuries which are obtained through trade.
Trade is permissible according to the Qur'an, Sunnah, consensus of Muslim
scholars, and analogical dedu<:tion.
Allah says:
''. .. but Alla/, has permitted trade..." (Qur'an: AI-Baqarah: 275)

And:
''Tl1ere is 110 blame up•ou you for seeking bountyfrom your Lord

(Qur'an: AI-Baqarah: 198)

T: TRADE TRANSACTIONS

10

The Prophet (PBUH) sal.d:
"The seller and the buyer have the right to keep or return goods as
long as they have not parted. If both pnrties speak the truth nnd
point om the defects and qualities (of the goods), then ihey will be
blessed in their tmnsaction. But if they tell lies. or /ride something,
then the blessings of their transactio11 will be destroyed.• '
Muslim scbo.lars uniformly agree on the permissibility of tmde in general.

Concerning analogi.al deduction, trade transactions are permissible
because people's needs are interdependent, and people grant nothing for
nothing. A person does not give wbat be has, money or goods, to retnm for
nothing, so wisdom necessitates the permissibility of trade in 1mla to enable
people to get their needs.
Trade transactions can be validated by means of a verbal formula or an
actual one. T he verbal formula expresses the seller's verbal agreement on the
sale when he, fop example, says to the buyer, "Well, I sell it 10 you" and the
buyer's verbal acceptance when he, for example, b,1y8, ''And I buy it". The actual
formula is the act of exchange itself, when the sdier 1·s given ,the usual price
and the buyer takes the commodity, without any verbal .declaration.
Sometrmes a trnde transaction is vnlldated by means of both verbal nnd
actual formul.is. Shaykbul-Jslam 1aqiyyud-Dtn (may Allah have mercy on
him) said:
"There ar11 some ways of exchange. First, wllen fhe seller g.ives only
a verbal accepumce and the buyer takes ihe commodity (wilhaiu
,leclarfog Iris acceptance). For example, a seller may say to the b11ye1;·
"Toke this piece of cloth far a diriar; 0 an4 the buyer takes it (without
sayi11g a word). The same Titling applies when the price is a give11
matcrlal;for example, these/fer may say to the buyer, 'Take this piece
ofclot!.tfor yours' and tlten tire ln~yer takes ii. Second, when the buj•er
declares his aaeptance a11d the seller only _gives him the. commodity
whether the pri12 is II given 11u1te:ria/ or the s(1/e is on credit (and
t/1e buyer is honestly guaranteed to pay), Tli;rd, wl,en neither t/,e
seller nor the buyer speaks (ilbout the price) for there is a CU$10m

Conditions Related to thie Seller and the Buyer
First: Mutual Co11sent: A trade transaction becomes inva1id if either the
sellt!l· or lht! buyer is wnJusdy forced to conclude it, Allah, Exalte<,l be
He, soys:
"... but only /In lawful} busines$ by f/lu.tua/ con$ellt..."
(Qur'an: An-Nlsii': 29)

Moreover, the Propher(PBiJH) said,

"Selli11g should be only by m11tu1il consent.•

(Related by Ibn Hibbil.n, Ibo Mdjah, and othercompilersofI:Iad1171)'

t-Iowever, a tran6a,lion concluded through just compulsion is deemed
valid, as ln the case when the ruler (or the one in .iuthorlty) forces a
bankrupt person to sdl his remaining property in order to pay off
his debts.
Second: Being free, having reached puberty, heing legally accm,ntable,

and being sane: A lracle transaction bc~otnes •invalid if either of the
seller or the buyer is a. mtnor, u foolish or weak-minded person, on
in~ane person, or n slave-who has not taken his maMer's permission (to
conclude the transaction).
Third: Being the owner (oflhecommodityorthe money) ora representative
of the owner: The Prophet (PBUH),o;aid to Halim lbn Hizam:

"Do ,wt sell what you do 11ot have (or possess)."
(Related hy Ibn Mftjal1 and At-Tirmidhl who deems itaialPh (autlientic)
-b.adfth),.

AI-Wazir said:

"Scholars agree t!tal ii is impermissible for a Muslim to sell whatever ls
not present with Aim ,or whatever ltc does not possess, a11d then goes ol/l
to buy that thingfor iii. ciLStonter.for 1/rls i5 a void trud~ trmunction."

Conditions Related to tlite Commodity
First: Being absolutely lawful to use: It is impermissible 10 sell what.ever
is prohibited for a Muslim to make use of. such as intoxkants, the
flesh of swlne. muskail instruments, and de-~d -animals. The Propher
(PBUH) sa-id:

"All11h and }Us Messenger prohillited the trade of into)fica11rs. dead

(R,elated 1;,y Al-Bukhar1 ~od Muslim)'
He (PBtrn) also said:

"Allah pmliibite1/ i11toxicanl-< and their (gainet/) prices, dead animals
and their prices, and pigs r,,uJ their pr/res."
(Related by Abu OilwudJ'
It is also illegal to sell the impure fots (or lhe ones affetted by lmpuril'y)
fur the Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Whe,1 Allah prohibits sometlilhg, He prohibits the price paidfor it." 1
Aiso, Al-Bukhari and Muslim relnted that the Prophet (PBUHJ was
asked:

"O Alla/ts Messenger! What about the fat of dead animals, jor it is
used for greasing t/1e boats 1111d the hides,, and people use ii (tis oil) for
lamps?'' He (PBIJI{) replied, 'No, it is prohibited.' "
Se~ond: The price and the commodity must be available, ( when the
trade transacfion i~ conduded), for any unavailable commodit)' is
considered nonexistent and u illegal to be sold. For eJQlmple, it i~
illegal to sell a fugitive 6lave, a runaway camel, or a bird in the air.
Like"~se, it is illegal for a Muslin, to sell something taken by force
except in the presence of the one who took it forcefully, or one who is
able to restore it (such as the police or a judge or the like, to .guarnntee
delivering it to the buyer).
'l'hird: The price and the commodity must be known lo the seller and
buyer, foe hiding any is regarded ,\S fraud which ls prohibited in lslan1.
Thereupon, it is invalid for the buyer to buy somethit1g he do<'S not see
or recognize, aud for the seller to sell an animal embqro In its mother's

Prohibited Trade Transactions

Allah has made trade permissible for His servants as long as it does not
cause them to miss what is more useful and much important, such as an
obligatory act of worship. Trade is also permissible so long as it does not cause
any harm to others.
It is impermissible for a Muslim upon whom the Jumu 'ah (Friday) Prayer
is obligatory to buy or sell aft.er its second prayer call (adhan). for Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
"O you who l1ave believed, when [the adhan) is called for the
prayer on the day of Jumu 'ah [Friday], then proceed to the
remembrance ofAllah and leave trade. That is better for you, if
you only knew."
(Qur'An: Al-Jumu 'ah: 9)

Thus Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, has prohibited trade when the
prayer call for the Jut11t1 •ah (Friday) Prayer is declared lest Muslims should be
too busy with trade to attend the Prayer. Allah has mentioned trade in particular

)is it i~ c,ne of the most important worldly activities that occupy people's times,
as- most people earn their living through trade. This Divine prohibition implies
that trade is prohibited and invalid at such a time (when. the fumu 'ah Prayer
is due). Then Allah, Glori6.ed and Exalted be He, says, "That", referring to
leavipg trade and attending the j,,,m, •ah Prayer, ,.I s /,efferfor you," than being
occupied with trade "ifyou only knew"your own good and interests. Likewise,
it is prohibited for a Mus)im to be occupied with.arty worldly .activity,•oot only

lt is impermissible for lvluslims as well 10 let trad~or any other worldly
activity divert them from ,establishing obligatory pruy~r& after hf!:lring the.

(Qur'an: An-Nur: 36-38)

It 1s afsoillegal to sell'an'.fll'ting which.can be used for disobeying All.ah and
commltting a sin. To illustra,te, it is illegal to sell certain fruit juices to whoever
µses them for making intoxicants, as it would be co ope cation in sinnlng. Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
". .. but do ,wt cooj,i:rate,/Jt s/11 a111faggression ..."

(Qur'~n; AI-M~'idah: 2)
This :tond of s~le is considered cooperation in aggression. Similatly, it is
lllegal to sell weapons, armlaments, and m1mltions ,r,t the time of dissention
among Muslims lest they· might be used for killing Muslims; the Prophet
(PBUH) prohibited Muslims to do so, and Allah, Exalted be He, sa)'s:.
'''...but do. nol toop,!t'ate in sin and aggression ..."
(Qur'an: AI-Ma'idah: 2)
In lhis co11necclon,, lbnul-Qayyim sald1
•:,i,111eg,ilproofs demori.strate that tf,e v11/idlty, Jeg11_lityand permissibility

use it for /cilllng a Muslim, as this is tro,isiqe,-ed rooperation in ,sin
and aggn,s$ion. However; ifa Muslim sell.< a weapo11 to someone who
fights In the Cai,se of Alla]i, it is considered (for ihe seller) a sign of
obedienceand devotion.to Allah. On J/1c otl,erhand, It is impermissible
to sell weapons to those who fig/rt Muslims or those who use lhcm for
higlnvt1y robbery, as it is regarded as .coop.-mtio11 ir, sin.~'
Muslims are no, permitted as well to cancel the sales of orie another:: For
example. a Muslim seller marsa:y ro a customer who hos paid'ten pound$ for an
item from another seller, "I can .,ell you a similar piece for only nine pounds;'
or "I can seH you a better one for lhe same price." This is prohibited for the
Prophet (PBUH) said:

''You must not try to cancel tl,e sales ofone another.''
(Related by AI-Bukh,lri .ind Musiim)'
Toe Prophet (PBUH1 also said:

'.½ Afusfim must not try to cancel 11,e sules of his (lvJuslim) brother.•
(Related by Al-Bukhirl and Muslim).'
Likewise, it is impetlllissible·for Muslims to cancel the purchases of one
another, For instance, a Muslim buyer may say to a seller who has sold another
Musiim a commodity for nine pounds, ''I cau buy ii for ten pounds," or the
like. Now:pdays, many a prohibiced trade tt:insaction like lhe aforementioned
one.5 occurs in the markets of Muslims, So, .i true Muslim mnst avoid such
'tjolations, forbid them, and show disapproval of thme who commit them.
Among the prohibited trade transactions is that made by a, 1own dweller
on behalf of a desert dweller, for the Prophet (PBUH) said:
'j\ town dwellei· s1w1Jid not trade 011 bchnlj'of a desen dwellet.'''

fbn ' Abbas, eo,nmenting on this hadnl1, said, '71 means that lie (a tow11

dweller) s!io11ld not actns /iis (a desert dweller~) broker,'••
The Pr0pbet (PBUH) also said ~

''le,iv~ ·t/~e peopie alo11", Allah will give them provision from one
another/''
Thus, .i town dweller is prohibited to sell or huy on behnlf of a desert
dweller. Ln fact, what ts prohibited ls thal a town dw~ller goes to a desert dweller
and offers hrs service to buy or sell s1>mething on his behalf; Yet, it becomes

pemlissible only ifthe desert dweller is th~ unewho ,;omeyto the town dweller
asking·him to buy or sell on his behalf.
Another type of prohibited trade ls 1hat called •i11al,, 'in which a seUer
sells a commodity oa credit ton h11-yer -and tl1en buys it from h.im at the same
time at a lower price. .For ex;unple, a trader sells a car for twenty thousand
pounds on credit tbeo bnys ii from the same man (who has jnst bought it) foe
fifteen tbousai1d pounds cash, Thus, tbe original buyer owes the seller twenty
lhous,md pounds to be paid at the due time. This kind of selling is prohibited
1
as it is.m~re fraud and one of the forms of riba . In this way1 the seller sells a
sum of money on credit for another one 111 cash, making the commodityJust a
me.ins offraud. The Prophet (PBUH) said:

"lfyou sell to one aT1other with ''inah, hold tlte tails ofcows (f.e. become

Conditions of Trade
TraLDsactions

Recurrent are the conditions set by a seller or a buyer when concluding
a trade transaction. Accordingly, it has become a necessity to study and
tackle the different kinds of s;uch conditions, pointing out the legal and
the illegal ones among them. Thefaqihs' (may Allah have mercy on them)
defined a condition (of a trade transaction) as follows: "It is obligating
one of the two parties (of the sale) by the other for the benefit of the latter."
According to the faqihs, a tr.msactional condition is invalid unless it is
made at the time of the transaction and embedded in the transactional
contract. In other words, a condition is invalid if made before or after
concluding the contract.
In general, the conditions in trade transactions are divided into valid
conditions and invalid ones.

I: TRADE TRANSACTIONS

20

First: Valid Conditions
Vaiid conditions are those that do not contradict the objective of the
coniract. Such a 'kiod of c,:indition obligates its fulfillment; the J>rophet
(PBUH) said:
1

''Muslims must keep to the conditions they mnke.''

Such conditions obligat<e fulfillment also because all conditioQs iu trade
transactions are OFiginally legal except for those invalidated and prohibited by
the La~giver ' . T!te yalid conditions ar~ of two kinds:
1- 'Fhe first kind of val id Gonditions of trade transactions is that which
ensures and consolidates the contract, and benefits the one who sets
such conditions. Examples of such valid conditions are those made by
the seller such as stipulating taking a security deposit or stipulating
surety; this s)ll:ely makes the seller free from worry. There are similar
valid conditions in favor of the buyer, such.as stipulating delaying the
payment or. part of it for a specified term, i.e. to pay it at a sp,:,cific
date. So long as the buyer is coP1mitted to this ,ondition the sale is
valid. A buyer may set a condition concerning a specification of the
commodity, such as requiring a 6pecial brand or product, as people
have different prefe:rences. In such a case, the sale is legally valid as
lung as the commo<1.ity meets µus condition; otherwise, the buyer
has the· right to car1cel the contract or at least get a compensation
for the mls$lng stipulated quality. This compensation is estimated by
comparing the value of the commodity meeting the required condition
and the one lacking it, and then the difference between the two values
can be paid lo the buyer if he asks for that.
2- The second kind of val1d transactlonal condflions is that in which one
of the two parties stipulates benefiting lawJully from t:he c6mmodity
in a certain way. For example, a seller of a honse may stipulate staying
therein for a specific! period, or a seller of a riding animal or a car·n1ay
stlpuiare riding ii to a cevtnin place. Jabir (may Allah be pleased with
him) narrated:

"The Prophet (PBUH) sold a mmel and stipulated to ride it (and use
it) 1111til he readies :Medina."
(llelnted by Al-Bnkbarl and Muslim)'
This b.adith states th,: permissibility ofselling an animal andstipillating
riding ii to a certain place; lh" -b'ame goes for similar transactional
cases. Another exnn~ple is wl\e11 !he buyer stipulates a specific work

Chaprer 3: ,Condiciou): ofT¼dc T raru;aafon~

21

to,be done. to the commodity, ,-uch as buying firewood stipulating that
the seller should deliver .it, or buying ciorlt making a co11dition tliat the
seller should stitch it.

Second: Invalid Conditions
There are two kinds of,inval.id oond,tions:
l- The first kind is lhe Inivaiid illegal condition that basically nullifies

the selling contract, such .is when one of the rwo parties stipulates
anotner conl-ract withiln the mnin one. For example', it is an illegal
condltion when ;1 seller of a corumodity makes a condition that the
buyer must make him his partner in husiness, lend him a sum of
money, or allow him to share his bouse,etc., or that he says; "[ sell you
thls commodity on the condition that yuu rent me your home." Such
a condition is legally invalid so it nullifies tbe origina,1 contfact, This
·is because the Prophet (PBUH) forbade concluding a selling contract
based on another condjtional contract '. This Prophetic prohibition
was interpreted by (mom Ahmad lbn Hanbal (may Alla!i have mercy
on him) exactly as we have pointed oul above.
2, The second type of invalid transactional conditions is the one which
Itself is null and void, yet it does not nullify the contract. For exainpl'e,
a buyer-of a commod'ity may make a condition that he wlll grve il bac)c
'if be undergoes loss, or ,a seller ofa commodity may make a condition
that the buyer must not resell it. Sufh a type of conditions is legally
invalid as it violates the principle ofa busi ness contract that absolutely
allows 'the buyer to ui,e the (puTchased) comrTiodity in whatever
manner he likes. The Prophet (PBUH) said:

"ffanyone imposes a co,•1ditio11 whililr is not i11 the Bnok ofAllah, t]u:n
that condition is·invalid' e11en if he Imposes,on·c J11111dr;rd co11ditio11s,"
(Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)'
'The phrase "in the Book of Allah" m tile aforementioned hadUh refers
10 S/mri •ah (tslamk Law) including the Qur.in and the S1,1m1ah.
Still, snch an l nvalid type of condllions does not nulll'?' the contract.
To illustrate, in the well-known incident of .Barirah. the one who
soli her made a condition ttial. her wala'' would go to him if she
was emancipated. However, the Prophet (PBUH) declared that the
condition was nu ll, yet he (PBLJllf) did not consider the contract to be
invalid. Then, the Prophet (PBUH) said:

i: 'rRADE TRANSACT'IONS

n
"Verily, tile walti' is for the emnndpmcm"'

A Muslim involved in businesses, purchasing and selling, should learn
the legal rulings on trade transactions as well ns the valid and invnlld
conditions of any business deal to l>e aware of the legal situations
in such dealings. Thus, Muslims can find legal solutions to tl1eir
controversies resull ing from trade transactions, most of which result
from the ignorance of the seller, the buyer, or both, of such rulings, as
well as the invalid conditions they set in LTansaclions.

CHAPTER

Option in 1:'rade Transactions
Islam is a lenient and comprehensive religion that cares for Muslims'
interests and mitigates difficuilties to make things easy for them. This is
evident in the legal rulings concerning trade transactions as Islam gives each
of the seller and the buyer the choice to consider his own interest so that he
can confirm what benefits him and cancels out what appears to be against his
interest regarding the sale. Option in sales means seeking that which is better
in either the conclusion or the voidanc.e of the sale.
There are eight types of option in trade transactions:

First: Option during the Session
Both the seller and the buyer have the choice to confirm or cancel the deal
as long as they have not separated from the place of the deal, for the Prophet
(PBUH) said:

"Both the buyer and the seller have the option (ofcanceling or co11finning
t/Je bargain) as long as they have not parted a11d are still together."'

I TRADE. TRANSACTfON~

24

His Eminence scholar lbnul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

"The Lawgivet has ordairiecl ths CJption during the session While
concluding trade transactions for the Interests of the two parties
lo achieve full conseh/ and satisfaction which Allah stipulates In
transactions when He says, '... liy mutual consent...' (Qur'an;
An-Nisa':29) Sometimes a contract Is concluded without being
reccmsidered or reviewed. Therefore, /he pirfeel Sharf' ah (Islam it
law) necessitates the existence of a session tluring wfiich the two
parties can reconsider the deal. Thus, according to the aforementioned
hadfth,, both the seller and the buyer have. the choice to confirm or.
cancel the deal as long as they,have not separatedjrom the place ofthe
deal, Ho,,,ever, if the two parties or one of them ignores this,a.ipecl of
choice, the deal is still deemed valid once it is concl,,ded. This ·G/roiee
Is a rig/JI related to hoth the seller and tire buyer, and each of them l.s
allowed to ignore it '. .. as long as they have 1,ot parted and are still
together. or one of them gives the other the opti<m (of 'keeping or
·t anccling tlie bargain); as the Prophet (PBUH) sr1id. However, it is
prohibited for each of the two parties to hasten to lea,,e the ofher in
order to prevent /rim jr()m reconsidering tire deal. 'Amrlb11 Shu 'ajb
reported that the Prophet (PBUH) ~aid, '.., and it is not permissible
for one of them to separate from the other fer fet1r tlwt the latter
may demand that the bargain be re.~cinded:' ""

Second: Option of Stipulation
The two parties can stipulate, durfog or after concluding the contract, that a
certain period ofoption (to accep1· or reject the deal) is to be sp¢fled If both of
them agree lo that, then they l\ave the. right of option wliel:her to accept or reject
rhe deal within the specified period. This ls because rhe Prophet (PBUH) sajd:

"Muslims must keep to the co11diti011s t/1cy make."'
Moreover, the validity of tlie option ofstipulatiou is indicated in tlie,general
meaning of the following Qur'anic verse:
"O you who have beJi~ed,falfiU (allj co11tracts..."
(Qur'an: Al-~'idah: 1)
However, it is petmissible for each of tile two parties to make a ~-pedal
condition to -serve his owl) i11tere6ts even if the other does not malse BO)',
provided the otber•agrees. At a11y rate, option of stipulation is something that

Chapn:r 4; Optloa in Trade Tniou;icrians

concerns theseUer and the buyer, and they are allowed to use it in the way th<'y
like provided tliere is mutual coonsent.

Third: Option in Case of Deception
If the buyer or the ~eller is gravely deceived due lo misjudgment of tb.e sale,
he is permitted to confirm or c,incei the deal. The Prophet (PB\.JH) said:.
'"bne should not harm others nor should one seek benefitfar oneself

by t,11,sing horr·• to otlrers.•'
He (PBUli) alsu said:

"The property of-a Mus/'im is not lowful (to be taken) except by
his consent.'"'
None likes to be deceived through the sale. but ff the resulting loss is
fusignificant and usually occurs among. people, the deceived person has no
opt.ion to cancel the deal.
The option in case of decepltion or misjudgment is applicable in three cases!

The first 1=~e is that of deceiving a stranger seller (_or merchant) by
meeting him before he reaches the market If a Muslim enters into
a busine6s lrnnsaction wilh such a seller (or merchant), and tlien the
merchant finds out that he has b~en paid less, he le.gaily has the option
to cancel or confirm the transaction. Trn11m Musrrm related that the
Prophet (PBUH ) said:

•Do not meet a merchm1f on his way und enter i1ito business trans4ctiot1
with him. Whoever mf•ets him and buys from him and then the owner
of merchcmdise comes intc the market (ar1dft11ds that he has bee11 p(lid
less), he has.the optfo11 (to declare tloe tm,r;(lctron null and yofd)."1
Thus, the l'cophet (PBUH) prohibits a Mll:.lim ro meet a strnnge,·
(merchant} before he macbes the market, The Prophet (PBUH) teaches
us that if such a mercha,n t finds out that he has been paid less, he legally
ba.s theoptio11 to caned or confirm the transaction.

Sahykhul-l&llm Ibn Taymiyah {may Allah have mercy on him) said:

"T/,e Prophet (PlJUH) stressed that a stranger (merchant) l11u the opt/rm
10 cancel or confirm the. trade transactlon ift/1e buyer meet$ him outside

the m11rket (before the former knows abour the rece,ttmarket val11e),for
it is a kind ofdei;eption andJm1.1d."

l(i

I TRADE TRANSACTION~

Jb11i1L-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) stated:

"1'his lra"s11ctio11 is forbidden as the buyer can deceive the seUennerc/umt,
using the lat ier~ 1111awarencss of tlte market 11a.lue, and pay him less tlzan
what is due. Th~refore, lite Prop/ref (PBUH) gives such a merc/1alit tile
right of optmn whether to cancel or confirm such a deal when lie enters
the market (and knows tlte re(ent market valu-e). Such a merchant's right
of option fo case of deception is i11dispt1lable, as he does 11ot k11ow tile
11ct11ql market,value for Iris goods, ru,d, t/1us. the buyer. is,legally considered
deceitfttl: Likewise, a stra11ger has tlte same rig/it if he is sold something
exceedingly more expensive than that of the market ealue.~!
The second cue ip whkh the option ill case of de.ception is applicable
i's ihat of najsh, in which the buyer is deceived and ensnared by the
actificial outbiddin_g of a fake buyer. This is an illegal act as it involves
fraud and deception to ensnal'e the buyer; such a kind of saie~ najsh,
was prohibited by the Prophet (PBOH} who said, "Do not outbid In a
sale i/t order to ensnare (others)!'' A similar form of sach a fraudulent
selling is when the owner of the commodity lies to the buyer and tells
him 1hat he has been offered such and such a price for his commodity
or that ,h e has bought it :rt sud1 and such (a prke), Likewise. it is
regarded as 11ajsh when the seller apparently insists on a certain price
for h.is commo.dity; ,vhich costs mucli les& (than 1this), so that the buyer
may take it for the highest price possible. For instanc,:, a seller may ask
for Len pounds to sell a commodity that i; worth only five ln order to
make the bui•er pay a little less than ten.
1'hetbird case (ill which the option ln case of deception is applicable) is
that ofa gullible buyer. ln this regard, Imam Ibnul-Qayyim said,

"The Prophft (PBUH) says, '.Clie,llirig a guilible bµyer is (a kind of)
riba'° ''. A gullible' buyer is a person who does not know fhe act11al
ealue ofgoods and is not good at bargaining. Rathe,; such a person,
out of l1is kind 11at4re and innocence, trusts the selle,: Thus, if such
a buyer is gravely deceived 1hm11gl1 a sale, he has the right of'!JJtion
(whether to cancel tire deal or not)."ll
Generally ~peaking, selling based on deception is prohibited as it i~
a means of cheating the buyer, 1n some markets of Muslims, when a
new merchant offer~ some goods for saie, the main market merchants
conspire and send one of them to bargain with the seller for a lower
price. Thus, the seller becomes obliged to sell him the goods at a clieap

Chap«c 4: 0 11riun h, 'l'rltde Transac<iom

27

price (as nQbody else o'UtbiJ~). Afterwards, the buyer returns to his
fellow metchants to divide the goods among themselves. This is a
prohibited sale for it is a kind of deception llnd injustice. In such a
case, the deceived -seller has the right 1>f !lption to cancel the deal and
restore his goods once he knows about the plot. vVhoever commits
sueh deceitful transactions must give them up and turn to Allah in
repentance. Also, whoever is act1uainted with the legal ruling on suc'h
sales must show his disapproval ofthose who practioe them and repo.i;t
them to thqse in author1ty in.order to receive deterrent punishment.

Fourth: Option in Case of Cheating
Cheating in a trade trans~ction means to swindle by making the coin1I1odity'~advantage visibl.c aod concealing its defect.In such transactions, the seller
keeps the buyer in a state of darkness so that the latter would be unable10 see
the defe<:t, There are two kinds of such 11-ansactlonal cheating:
1) Hiding.the defect of the commodity
2) Displaying the commodity beautifully in order ~o rai,se its price
All kinds of cheotfng are prohibiied, and µle S/lari'ah (lslamic Law)
ptll'mits the·buyer in this Cllse lo cancel the deal as he has pald the seller for a
false quality. ln addition, if the buyer had lcnoW11 t11e trut;h, he would nor have
paid that much. An example of such ch.eating is- keeping c.imels, cows or sheep
without milkfng for a long tfme before displaying them for sale to make the
tiuyer believe that they aiways give a lot of milk. The Prophet (PBUH) said:
"Do •riot keep camels or .1heep witho11t milking for a long time, for
whoever buys sud1 an animal has the option 10 milk ii and then
decide whether to keep it or return It to the ownet long with 011e ,i.d ·"
of dates (in compensation for milk1t1g-itJ.""

Another example of such transactional cheating is hiding the defects of
a house or a used car displayed fur sale to deceive the buyer,
A Muslim trader ,nust tell the in1th about his commodity for the Prophet
(PBUH) said:

''The seller and the buyer have lhli right lo keep or rftimi goods !IS
long as they have not par,ted. if both parties speak the truth and
point out the defects and qualities (of the goods), then they wm be
blessed -in their transaction- ffat ifthey tell lies ot hide something,
tl,en the blessi11gs of their transaction W'ili be destroyed.»"

l 'fRADE TRANS!',CTJONS

2

Thus, the Prophet (PBUH) ,States that telling the t,;µth ( while buying or
selling/ ls a means to get AJlahs blessing!i whereas telling lies causes the blessings
to be destroyed. 1'hat is to s'ay. a lit'fle. money gained through t~lling the truth
is blessed by Allah, but mtiJ:h ill-goneo money, gained lhrough lying, has no
blessing at all.

Fifth: Option in Case 1ofDefect
It Is the option given to i:he ~ to cancel or confion the deal because of
a defect. In this case, the cotpmod.ity !Jas a defect b~fQre. sille !!,nd the sel.ler has
not mentioned i[ or he knows nothing about it. The legal principle that gives
the buyer that option in case of defect is that a considerable defect ususllly
reduces tbe value of the commodity or decreases the material of the commodity
itself. lo otder to judge sucb a defect, the buyer should consult experienced,
trustworthy traders; if they consider something a defect, the 'buyer ts legally
permitted to cancel the deal, and if they see no defect that reduces the value
of the commodity or aecre:llses its material, the buyer has no cight to cancel
the deal. Therefore, when the buyer discovers and verifies rhe defect after
concluding the deal, he is htg<!lly permitted to confirm the deal, taking due
compensation (which is the difference in pri,;:c due to this defect) for the loss
caused by this defect, or to cancel the deal, giving back the commodity and
taking back his money.

Sixth: Option in Case ,of False Price
This right of option is applicable in fonr c;isu;
I- When the seller clai:ms that he wHI sell the commodity at the same
price he has paid fQr it and then the buj•er discovers that the ,actual
price is more or less than what the seller h:IS claimed,
2- When one drums that he will make another his partner in a transaction,
then the latter discovers that the actual capital put by the former is ,less
than wha\ he has claimed.
3- When the seller claims that he will gain only a Cl!rtain sum of money
more than what he has paid for the commodity, and tl\en the buyer
discovers that the actual price is less than that
4- When the ~eller da1ms that he will sell the commodity for a certain
snm of money less l:han what he bas paid for it. and then the buyer
discovers that the actual price rs less than that.

Chapce1· 4: Option In Tude Tnm~:acci 1u1s

29

lu these four cases, as l01ug ~s the actual price differ5 from tl\e price
mentioned 'by tbe seller, the bu1yer has the tight of option whether to cancel
Or confirm the deal, according to one of die opinions of the Ranball Scfiool.
The second opinion (in the Hanbalt School) is that the buyer has no option t6
cancel the deal, bui the deal wit:1be based on the actual price, not the false one
told by the se))er, and Allah knows best.

Seven,th: Optioq. in Case of Difference
If the buyer and &eiler diffe r about the price, the commodity, ib amount,
or its quality, and they have no proof. each of them must swear by Allah that
he tells the truth. After that, cad1 of th~m has the right to cancel the.deal if h.e
is not satisfied with the oath of the other.

Eighth: Option in Case oif Quality Cl1ange
Sometime a buyer pucchas,~s a commodity whkh he ~as seen some time
before (ooncluding (he deal), and then he discovers that its quality,has changed.
In this case, die buyer has.the right of option w hether to cancel,or confirm the
deal, and Allah k1iows best.

Disposal of a Purchased Commodity
Before Receipt and Rescinding
of Bargains
In this chapter. Allah willing, we will deal with the rulings on the lawful
disposal of a purchased commo,dity before receiving it. We will also illustrate
how the bargain is legally concluded and when it becomes illegal.
One should be aware that it is invalid to sell a pt1rchased commodity before
receiving it whether it is measu red, weighed, couoted, or measured by cubit,

as the Imams agree. The same ruling apl'lies lo other kinds of commodities
according to the preponderattt view of the Muslim scholars ( may Allah have
mercy-on them), for the Prophet (P.BUH) said:
"Hi: who buys a foodstiiff should not sell it until l,e has received it

wit!t exact full measure."
(Related by Al-Bulchflri and Muslim) '

I TRADE TRANSACTIONS

32

In llnother narration, lt t'l!lldt, •, .. Clrrtil he 1ias received it."' 1n Muslims narration, it states, ~ .. until he has weighed it:•'
•
Ibn ' Abbas (may AUah b.e pleased with hlm) said, "!consider t/rat t11esame
ruling (offoodstuffs) is applied to a/L types of stiks."' This ruling is directly
stated in the Swma/1 (Prophetic TI-adition); Imam Ahmad related that the
Prophet (PBUH) said:

"When you b11y s0111e,rlii11g, you slwuld not sell ·11 until yo11 irave
completely received it."' •
Moreover, Abll Dawud related:

"The Messenger of All.ah (PBIJH) forbade selling tire goods where
they are bought u11til the tradesmen take theni lo their houses."•
Shaykhul-lslam Jbn Taytniyah and his student Jbn11l0Qayyim (may A!lnh
have mercy on them.) stated;

''The cm~e behind prohibiting the buyer to sell a cominodity wit/I
Ire has completely rectiwed it is tire sercnd buyer's inability to receive
the commodity. The or;gu,al seJler may not delivet tire commodity fo
tire first buyer espeda/(y when the for111er sees the e:.pected profit of
lht buyer after se/li11g tlie smne commodity lo another perso;,. In this
case, the original seller rnqy do his best fO cancel the deal w/1ether
tltrouglr tcscindi11g or swindling. This ruling Is further confirmed by
tire (Proplteti~) prohibirion of making profit throu_gh wha{ is riot in
~
. . ,r I\
ones possession.
Accordingly, Muslims must adhere to the afornmentfoned transactional
legal rulings. When a Musllm buys a commodity, he is not pennitte4 to sell
il until he has fully recei.ved it. However. many people are negligent in this
regard, as they buy goods and sell them before l'hey Ieceive them, Or when
they receive only part of them, and this is not a legal receipt of the goods. For
example, a buyer may count sacks, parcels, or boxes in the store .of the seller,
and then sell them to,anoth,~r person, which ls nor considered a legal reeeipt
of the goods that enables the· buyer to seU them.
Some may ask. "What i;; then the legal reoeipt that enables the buyerto
have disposal of the purchased commodity?" The )lllSWer is that cl,e legal
receipt of goods differs :ict:t'lrdirtg to their kinds; e.very IUnd has ,its own
valid receipt If the goods a,re measured, weighed, counted, or measured by
cubit, fhei.r valid receipt m,ust be through measuring. weighing, counting.
or measuring by cubit respectively, provided the goods are taken to a p!a,e.

Ch•prec5: Disposal of a l\ircha"'d Commodity Before Receipt and ...

belonging to the buyer. Jf the goods are clothes, animals, cars, or µie likeJ
their valid receipt is fulfilled by taking them to a place belong1ng fo the
buyer. If the goods can be delivered by hand, such as jewels. books and the
like, their valid receipt is fulfilled by the buyer's actual possession of them.
Yet, if what is purchased cannot be moved to deliver, such as houses. lands,
or fruit on trees, its valid reGeipt is fulfilled by handing it over to the buyer to
be at his disposal as its new owner. The valid receipt of a house ( or tbe like)
is fulfilled by giving its key to the buyer and handing him over the property
as a new owner.
We h;we already mentioned some lladirhs protiibiting a Muslim ro sell
goods ifl\e has not validly and fully received them from the. seller: This ruling
serves the interests of both the buyer and the seller, and prevents controversies
and disputes resulting from t he remi~sness of the buyer .ind seller when the
former reGeives the goods from the laher, or when the buyer neither clm;ks
the commodity nor V'erifies its quality and specificatlons before exempHng the
seller from liability, A Muslim must adheretoaiid carry outlhe.iforementioned
rulings while concluding business.deals-.
However, many people today are remiss in the valid receipt of the goods
they purch.ise, committing what has been prohibited by fue Prophet (PBUH),
and thus they suffer controversies and disputes. Sometimes, the buyer regrets
when he discovers l he actual specificoltiom of the goods ,(aftet concluding the
deal ) and then he cannot cancel the deal .excepr through Jong arguments 11nd
dispwes; whoever violates the orders of the Prophet (PBUH) must regret and
suffer consequence~ in the end.
Among the trnnsactional acts that pave been 6\ressed and highly recommended by the Prophet (PBUH) is that either of the contractual parties 'is to
rescind the bargain if he regrets concluding the sale, does not need ,the commodity
any more, or is nn,1ble to pay it6 price. He (PBUH) said:

"W11never. accepts the demand of a MUJlim to rescind 11 bargain,
Allah will rescind his faults on the Daya/Resurrection."•
Rescinding tho! bargain means to cancel, ii giving each of the selle.r '.lnd
buyer his due right. Among the duties of a Muslim towards his fellow
Muslim brother is to agree to rescind the bargain when the latter needs thar.
urgently; this is asign-0f gentleness and good tteatment, as well as ooe(lf the
requirements of brotherliness and fellowship in fsh1m.

Riha

Verily, the issue of riba is one of the most serious matters that should be
tackled In this regard, all of the heavenly revelations have prohibited dealing
in it, and Allah warns those dealing in it with the severest threat. Allah, Exalted
be He,says:

"Those who consume Interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who Is being beaten by Satan
Into Insanity..."
(Qur'An: Al-Baqarah: 275)
In this verse, Allah decrees for the person, who deals in ribd and accepts its
interest that he ~annot stand' from his grave 'except as one stands who is being
beaten by Satan into insanity'. This means that the usurer only stands from
his grave like the epileptic when being at the time of paroxysm of epilepsy.
Figuratively, this is because the usurer used to accept interest on his money in
his life and thereby his abdomen became bulky with it.

36

!1RADETRANSACTJ0NS

Furthermore, Allah lhreatens the one who returns to dealinirin riba after
knowing !hat AUah has prohibited it, fhat he will be one of the inhabitants of
t'he fire wherein he will ab1de eternally. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
-: .. B11twhoever retllrns [to dealing in inttrest or usury)- those-qre
flu, comP"l!ions of tl1e Fire; they will abide eternally there/,._"
(Qu.r'an; Ai-Baqarah: 275)

Allah , Exalted be He, also says:
'!41/ah destroys ;nterest and gives i11creaJe for charities...~

(Qur'an: AJ-Baqarah: 276)
Th')sverse means that Allah wipes out the blessing of money that is mingled
with the interest gained from dealing in riba. Despite the fuct that the U$\1J'et
may become richer and richer.Allah will wipe offthe blessing of his money and
there will be no good in it Rather, tl\ismoney will r~ ult in bad cousequencea
upon ill> owner; he will be weary in thi~ life, pu1\ished in the Hereafter, and it
will be of no avail for him.
ln addit'ion, Allah describes the usurer as a, sinning disbeliever. AUah,
Exalted be He, says:
"Al/ah destroys /11terest and giyes increase for cl,airities. And
Al/al, does not like every .sitming dis.believer."
(Qur'An: AJ-Baqarah: 276)

ThuR, Allah rells (ils) that He does noLlike tbosc dealing in ribtl. Accordingly,
deprivati011 of the Divine love means being hated and detested by Allah.
Therefore, Allah, Exalted be He, 91Us the one deallng i•n rlbll a disbeliever. The
word 'disbelfeve( may be interp reted according to two meanings. As for the
first one, it refers to the perl>on who is exceedingly unirrateful to the favors of
Allah. Yet, his disbelief does not mean that he is no longer a Muslim .. In other
words, the usurer shows ungratefulness lo the divine favors but still believes
-.n Allah, This ig due to the fac! that this,person does not show mercy toward
the disabted, help the poor,.nor grant a ,respite to the insolvent person until tlie
latter's cirGumstances allow him to pay (to settle his due debt). With regard to
the second meaning, ,the word "disbeliever" may refer to the actual disbeliever
y;-ho is no longer a Muslim. TI1is is when such a person deals in ribd deeming
ii lawfui. Hence, A:llah, Exalted be He, describes·such a person in th1s ver&eas
a "si1111iHg dis/1e/le11er" since he is immersed in committing sins and wholly
engulfed in enjoying the material bcmefits illegally acquired from dim, and at
the same time-causes harm to others.

Furthem1ore, Allah. Exalted be He. as weU .as His Messenger (PBUH) bave
declared war againsl the usurer, since the latter is -an enemy of Allah and His
Messenger unless he stops dealing in riM, Allah describes the 115urer as a wrongdoer,
as He says:
"O you who have befieved,fear All111t and give up what retnains
[d,u to you] of i1tterest, ifyou sl1ould be believen. And if you
do 11ot, thct1 be i1,form~d of a war fagainst y(JuJfrom Allah a11d
His Messenger. Bui if you repenl, you n,Qy have your prr,u:ipa-Z

- [thus] )'1111 do no wrong, 11(1r are you wro11ged."
(Qur'iln: Al-Baqarah~278- 279)
1n addition to all these ,prohibitive Qur'anic verses that deter dealing fn
ribd and accepting. Interest, many othet prohibitive b.aditlls are st~led in the
Prophet's Swmah (Tradition). That is. the Propliet (PBtJJi) bas regarded riba

as one of the great destructive sins '. He (PBUH) has also cursed the one ,vho
ac-cepts ribll, the one who pays it the one who records it and the twowitne.sses
to it'. Moreover, the Prophet (PBUH) said that if one benefits from only one
dirham ' of ribil, (when he knows that it is iU-go1ten money), it will be more
than (the evil of) commining ad-ul1ery thirty three times'. In another narration,
the Ptophet (PBUHJ said:

"Rjba js like comrr,itf1i1g !ldultery thirty six tihres after the advent
oflslam."'
He, (.PBIJ HJ, also said:
µRibil is seventy two degrees (of evil), the ieast of which fesembles
1
(i11 /cs si11ful11ess) committing adultery with ones inoth?r.'

In this connection, Shaykhul-lslam Ibo Taymiyah (ma.y Allah have rnerey
on hirn) said:
"T/tr. prohibition of ribli is stronger'(because ofits degree ofs£11ft1/ness)
than the prohibition of gi1mb/f11g. Tl,is is because the ,ustlrer takes
u11lawfully 1111 in.crtu1Se (the interest) from a persat1 who is in need,
while the gambler 111r1y gain this increase or Jose it."

Then, lbn Taymiyah demonstr.ited that rfba, beyond doubt, is injustice.
Th.is js be~ause when dealing in riba, the rich person invests.his power over the
poor- (the borrower}, -while ln gnmbling, the poor may gain monq from the
rich or both gamblers may be eqli:il i n poverty or richness. Then he added:
''. ..As gat11bling /nvo1ves lakit1g money unjustly. i\llah prohibits it

is k11own that doi11g injustice to those in ri~ed (a$ the case i>J riba) is

•

in addltion to this, taking che in cerest (accrued from ribi:i transactlon.s) is
one of the characteristics of the Jews fur which they have deserved eternal and
continual curse. Allah, Ex-alted· be He, says:
"For wro11gdohlg o,,. tlte part of tlie.]ews, We made unlawful for

(Qufan: An-Ni.sa': 160 -Hi!)

The Wisdom behind Prohibiting Dealing in Ribti
- Dealing in ·ti/Id Involves consuming people's wealth un;ustly, That is,
the usUJ'er rakes tiba from people without giving them anything w;eful
in return;
- Dealing in rilitl tnvolves causing harm to those in need andwh() borrow
by irn;:r.~asing the debts due upon them (interest rates) when they are
unable to pay tbei r debts.
Riba prevents favors ®d kind treatment among people, blocks good
loans (l,e. loans withoutintere.sts). opens the door wide for lending for
interest, which overburdens the needy borrower.
- R/bu also results in stopping gains, trades, professions and crafts
without which other people's interests would not be set right. This is
because, when the usurer increases his money through ribll, witl1out
exerting any effort, then why sbould he look for other way~ to gain
his livelihood? ln this reg~rd, Alliill, Exalted be He, has made dealings
among people be IJased on mutual benefit in return for work or a
material return. On the other hand, dealing Jn riba does not involve
this, sinct it is §iJnply giving money multiplied, from one •p arty to
another, without any visible· product or worlc.
Lmguistically, ,t he word "rib/I." in Ar.able means increase, while Jurispru·
de11tiaUy, ribil meaM increas,: in particµ]ar things. and ii Is iliv1ded into two
kinds, The first is ribail-tra5r'a'h (conditionai excess for delay ofp?yment) and
the other kind i.s ribal fad.l (the selling ofan item for another of the same type,
on che spot, but in exress)

Chap<er 6: Rih,1

R;ban~Nasi'ah (Delay Usury)
The word 'nasi'al1' in Arabic refers to delay. Riban -nasiah Involves two !YPeS':

First: increasing the debt on the insolvent person (by way of an interest
rate). Thia is the origin of ribtl, Whioh uNed to be done in the PreJslamic Period of Ignorance (Al-Jaliiliyyah). Jt means that a person
owes another person a sum of money that Is to be paid at a certain
time, So, when itis lime for paying b11ck, ti\e credil'or gives the debtor
the option either to pay the debt or to allow him much more time in
return for an interest on the bo~rowed sum. Therefore, if the debtor
chooses not to ,settle his debt, the creditor prolongs the period of
payment against an interest, wbiclt tlwreby results in the excesslve
increase of the debt. This 'is why Allah, Exalted be He, prohibits this
type of transactions sayi11g;
''... A11difsomeoneis in hards/tip; then {let there beJpostponement
{Qur'An: AI-Baqarah: 280)
,mtil [a time of] ease..."
The verse signifies that if the' time of payment is due and the debtor is
unable to fulfill his debt, it 'is impermissible for the creditor to increase
deot; rather tlie creditor should give the debtor a gra~e period. Qh the
other hand, if the debtor is wealthy; h.e is to pay his due debt. Hence, no
,increase on the ,debt (by way of all interest) should be made whethe~
the debtor is insolvent or not.

Second: It refers to the r.1/ui l:;lken through selling goods of the same type
but in exc.ess (which is the property In the case of riba'l-fadl) with
del.1ylng the date of delivery, whether for both or just one of the items.
'fliere are many examples of this type, such as selling gold for· gold.
sil~r for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for bailey, dates for dates, salt
for salt and the like. B'esides, this type includes selling any type 0£ these
items for the same on a ·edit:. The same applies to whatever shares these
items in !he property (of ribaljatil), as will be pointed out below,

Ribal--Fadl (Excess Usury)
This type of riba refers to the selling of an item for another of the same
type but in excess. With regard to this issue, the Prophet (PBUH) dictates that
this kipd of transactions ls.prohibited in six items, na.mely, gold, silver, wheat,
barley; dates and &alt. Thus, if any of these items is sold in exchange fur another
of the same type, then it i~ prnll ibited to take more than the other (in weight or

40

I TRAOE TRANSACTIONS

measure). Ibis is due to the b:mlit/1 narrated by ; Ubadah lbnU§•S.Lriit (may Allah
be ple'~St'4 with him) as a 1•n11rfu ' (traceable) /J.adtth,• in which the Prophet
(PBUH).said:

"Gout is to be pai.dJof'.gold., silver for silver. wheat far wheat, barley
for barley. dates for da1!es, 11111l salt/or salt, /ikefor like and equal for
equal, <111d payment -is to be made liand to hand."
(Relat.e d by l'm~m Altinad and Imam Muslim)1
The above l!acfith stales 1be prohibition of paying gold for gold. ;ill its types.;

coined or nDt, silver for silver, wheal for wheat. barley for barley ot dates for
dates, unless like for like, ei:iunl for equal aJ1d payment is made on the spot.
Further-more, the "najority of scholars uniformly agree 0 11 the prohibiJioo of
sellingan.Ilem as a payment foe another unless both are equal. The same ruling
applies to other things that sbate the same cause of judgment Yet, scholars
differ as regards setting such cause ofjadgment. 1n this respecl;, the soundest
vlew is that the common pr,operty ln money (coins or banknotes) is its value,
Thoe 1s other similar types are to be valut-d according to the value of money,
such as those b!lllknotes ust,d today. Hence, it is mnl'htained prohibited to sell
any of such items in excess for auothei· of the same type, namely, being i_ssued
in the lJame country.
As fot the cat1se of judf,ment nf the resf of lhe six items - mentioned in
the previous /!adith, namel-y;, wheat, b.i:rley, dares and sah ~ ihs the measim,·or
weight; besides, such items are ~dible. Th,is, i:he s,vrunuliug applies to wh.ttever
shares any of their property; as regards weight or measure and edibility. That
is, such type of ttansactio11s, (i.e. ribal-fad.l) is viewed prohibited, unless there
is ,:quality in measure or weight
ln this connec,fion, Sh.ay:khul-lslam lbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy
on him) says:

'' ,. 1,'h~ criter/011 in prol,iltiti11g the ttansactioHs ofribal-fll/!l is nteas1,rc
orwcfght (of items bei~1gpaidfor other iterns) i11 addition l'o edibility,
Thi; is one of tire two views rnairrtained by Jmiim Al!rr1ad." '"
Accordingly, whateve.r item shares these six items mentioned in the /Jadith
in that cause of judgment (namefy being edible and measurable or beli1g edible
,md can be weighed, or is paid for as a price), it is to be included in tranb-actians
condemned as ribtl. Simila,rly, if such items shnte that cause of judgment as
well as being of the same type, then it is prohibiled to sell wheal for wheat.foe
example, in excess or with delaying the payment. This is based on the badtth
of ihe Prophet (PBUH), in ,~hlch he s~ys;

Ch2ptcr 6, Ribd

,j 1

''Gold is to be paid for gold, silver for silver; wheat for wheat, l:1arlt.y
for barley, dates for dates, and saltfor salt, likefor like and equalfor
?qual, and pay,nent is to be made hand to hand:"''
Furlhermore, if the items share the same cause of judgment but differ
in type. sucb as in cases of selling wlieat for barley,.it is prohibited to delay
payment; it must he made on the spot. While, in this case, it is permissible
to seU one type f~r more of the other. This is due to the badfth, in which the
Prophet (PBUH) says:

"...if these cfasses differ, then sell as you wish ifpayment is made
/land to hand,"
(Related by Muslim andAbt) D~wud)"
The phrase "hand tO hand" here means that payme11t must take place on
the spot before the two parties separate. On the other haod, if the items are
different in both cause of judgment and type, it is maintained permissible to
pay one type for more of anothet, so is the case of delaying payment, such as
Gell1ng gold for wheat Or silver for barley.
Let it be known to you, dear Muslim reader, that it is viewed impermL~sible
to sell an item which could be weighed for another of the same type except
With equal weight. Besides, it is impermissibTe to sen a measurab1e ttem for
another of the &ame type except with equal measure. This is due to the badlth,
in which the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"Gold is ro ·be paid for gold wit/1 equal weight, a,1d silver is to be
paid for silver with lfqllal weight, and wlreat is to be paidfor wheat
with equal
.,.,,111eas11ra, m•,d barley is to be paldjor bt1rley with equal
mea,ure.
Besides, since items -wmnot be equal when their legal critedon ( measure
or weight) is different, it is impermissible to sell an item t hat can be weighed or
measured with a mndom weight or measure for another of the same type, This
is because one does not guarantee that both items are equal; hence, ignorance
of equality ls like knowing about excess (in one item over t he•o'ther).
As for the issue of money exchange, whether of the saml' type or not, and
whether money is of gold, silvec or banknotes, which are common these days,
\he ·same ruling applied to the selling of gold arid silvel"is to be applied to lt.
This is based on the fact tha1 they share the same property; being of value that.

l'TltAOE TRANSACTIONS

can be measured.Thereupo n,.iian amounr of money is exchanged for another
of the ,;nme type. such .is go,ld coins for gold coins, silver coins for silver coins
or any category of paper money for another of the same type (e.g., a dollar for
a dollar ot Saudi paper dfrbrups for the like), both exchanged items must be
equal in value. Besides, pay1rnrnt mu.st take phce on tlie spot. flowever, if an
amount of money of one type is excbang,ed foranother of a different type, such
as t xchanging Snudi paper rfyals for US dollars, or exchanging gold coins for
6ilver.coins. both parties (the buyer and the-Seller) must be prese)lt at the time
of the exchange. and paym,:nt mnst take place on the spot, !n such -:i case, it is
permissible to,exchange one? typ,e for more ofthe other type, both according lo
their value. Simjla.rly, if a piece of gold jewelry ls sold for silver dirhams or for
paper money, both the buyc!rand the seller muSl be present at the time of the
transaction, .ind the payme1nt mu.~t take place nn the spot. The same applies to
the selling of silver jewelry for _gold coins.
On the <>ther hnod, If a piec~ of gold or silver jewelry is sold for jewelry or
money of th<' same type, sul:.h as in the case of selling a piece of gold for gold or
a piece of silver for silver, there ore two matters th.it should be fu !filled. Pirsi,
6otl, pieces must be equ-:tl in weigl\L Second, both the buyer and the seUer
must be present at the time of concluding the transaction 1111d the payment
must take place on the spot.
With regard to this, den.ling in ribt\ implies ·a great danger that one cannot
avoid, unless one is well .1c~tu.tinted with its rulings. Therefore. whoever is not
able to know about its rulings by l1i.mself can ask the people of knowledge.
This is because ii, is not _permissible for someone to undertake any transaction,
except when being certain that it does not involve rib/I, so that bis religion
ean be saved and he can re:1rne himself from Allah's punishment, wit!:i whicl1
He has threatened the u~u rers. It is .also impermissible- to iroltate others in
any kind of transactions, wiithout consklering it carefully. especially nowadays
when people do not considc!r the ways througl1 which they can get tbcir wealth
and gains: be they lawful 01· not. In this respect, rhe P1·ophet (PBUH) said;
"Tl,et"e will come a tune when people w/11 cat (i.e., /c/ke) riM. Ewrr
the one who will 11ot eat it mny ,wt spare its dust (i.'C. he 111ili he
11
affec/ed by ii in a wa.i• or a11ntlier),''

It is worth mentioning here that there are many usurious tra-nsactions
under1aken nowadays. Orne of these [ransactious is increasing the debt on
the insolvent debtor' (by way of an interest rate) when one's debt become8
due and one is unable to l'ulfill 1L That is. the creditor allows the debtor· lo

Cllap.rcr 6: .RIM

postpone fulfilling the debt ancl in return , he increases thal debt in a: certain
percentage <1cGordi.ng to the df:btor's period of delay, Thi; ls the ri/:lit done
at the Pre-Islamic Period of lg,norance (Al-fahiliyy11h) which is prohibited
according to the 1manimous agreement of Muslim scholars. lrt rhis regard,
Allah, Exalted be·He, says:
"O you who have beUeved,fear Allah attdgive of, wl,atremains
[due to you] o.f interesj'., if yorJ sl,ould be believers. A nd ifyou
do""'' then be Informed qf a war [!lgainst yo11Jfrom Allah and
His Messenger, Brit Ify,ou repent, yo11 may hRi•e your principal

is ill h11rdship, t11e11 [/i!t tl,ere beJpostpo11ement until,[a time
of] e4se .. ,"
(Qur'ful: Al-.Baqarah: 278-280)
In these noble verses, AllaJ~. Exalted be He, threatens those taking and
dealing in riba with many threa:ts, 1'hese 1hreats involve:
fjrsl, Allah, Exalted be He, addresses His servants ~aying, "O yort who

liave believed..;'' and •~.. ifyo11 sl1011ld be believers, .." which in.'!icates
that it ls nol proper for a b\!)iever to deal in tibtl.

Second, Allah, Exalted be·.Ae, says, "...fear Allah,, ," which indicates I.hat
those deallng·ln ribd' do not obey Allah no~do they fear f-!im.
Third.Allah says, "... 1t11dgive up what 1·emait,s.{due to you} ofln.terest•••"
This part of the verse ts considered a divine command that obligates
r~frainiog froin dealing in riba. Hence, this prohibilion indicates that
1./hoever deals in it disobeys the Command of Allah.
Fourth, Allah, Exalted be·He, has declared war against those who do not
give up dealing ill rib,i, as He, say!>, ".. .. and lf yori do 11ot...u whic;h
n1eans if those dealing in ribt! do not •give up, •:. , Ihen be informed of
a war [ag11irostyou] from Allah a11d His Messenger..." This means tliat
fhose dealing in riba should come lo know that they, indeed, wage war
against Allah and His lv1essenger.
Fifth, Allah, Exalted be He, addresses the usmer as a wrongdoer, saying,
"...b11t ifyou repe,.t, you may /,ave your principal - [thus] you do no
Wrong; nor are you wro11ge,l."
T.here is anoth.e r usurious i:ransaction, namely lending against a specified
interest. This is through lending something to someone. such as an amount
of money, on the condition that the borrowed amount be paid back with
an interest. it may :ilso be th.rough crediting an amount of money on tlie

I TRADE TRANSACf10NS

condition thot the borrower mlllit return moretha11 its actual value according
to ,an agreed upon percentage. These -are explicit usurfous transactions
done in ban,ks as well as the other banking institutions, as they conclude
transactions through lending Joans for those needing them, traders, factory
owners, etc. They lend these categories charging them a fixed interest
calculated according to a specified percentage. Such percentage is increased
in case of failure to pay the amounr of the loan on its due time, Thus, such
type of lending involves both types of riba, namely ribql-fadJ (excess usury)
and riba11-11asi'ah (delay usury).
Similarly. depositing at bnnking institutions for a specified period and
againsl a specified int.erest is considered one 0£ the usurious tran~actfons.
During this period. the bank has the right of free disposal, as regards the
deposited amount until1he matul'ity dote. So, the depositors are paid (by the

Likewise" the issue of 'ina/, ,; transactioM is considered amongst the
usurious transactions. JI refers to a tr~nsaction in which one buys a commodity
on credit then sells it in cash to the srune person but at a less prke. In this
kind of trans~c!ions, the buyer takes an amount of cash against the commodity
previously bought on credit, yet it is but a pretext for gaining ribtl. '!'here are
ma1iy 1l,1dil/,s and traditions forbidding d.ealing t n ·111ah .transactions. For
ellample, Abu Dawildrebues a !11ulf1h, in which the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"If you sell to one another with ·11111l1, hold t/!e tails of cows (i.e.
become occupi'e(./ w1th worldly gai11s), are plerued with agriculture,
mtd give up cohductii1gjil111d (fig/It.Ing in lht Cause ofAllnh), Allah
w/IL make disgrace prevail over yuu, and will no/ withdraw it until
)'OIi return (Le. adhete) to your religio11.'''"
The Prophet {PlilJH) al~o says:

"There will m1r1e tl lillte for flMplc when lfiey will ,considrr rib/I
lawful by mea11s of trade."
Therefore, every Muslim must take precaution lest ribli should be mingled
"~th his.transactions and mouey. This i~ because taking ,ibti and dealing il'I it
are among the major sins. Besides, no people deal in rilui and commit adultery;
but Allah, Exq!ted be He, afflicts them with pov~rly, incurable diseases and
.injustice f.roru rulers. Moreover, rib/I causes destiruction to one's wealth and
wipes off.its tllessing.

furthermore, Allah strongly wamsa.nd threatens Muslims against accepting
tiba Olllking it one of the most ab,ominabl'e dee,;1's and one ofthe mostgnevous
of major sins, Allah, Emlted be He, also demonstrates the penalty be imposed
i'.mthe usurer in both this life andl in the Hereafter, as lie stated, i11 the Glorious
Qur'an, ~t the usurer wages w,ar against Allah and His Messenger (PBUH).
Thus, Allah punishes the usurers: in this world through destroying the blessing
oftheir wealth makitlg it 5ubject to damage and nun. How often we hear about
people's huge wealth being damaged by way of fires and flood, thus •turning
lts owners into poor people! However, if those usuri6us people stiU keep their
wealth acquired through riM, such wealth will be of no use since Allah takes
away Us bles.slh.g. Besides, those 1people only -suffer the trouble of its collection.,
bear its imposed punishment (on the Day ofResurrectiol\) as well as become
tormented in the Hellfire for it,
ln addition, the usurer 1&h;1ted by AU.ah as well as by the people, .since

he takes money but never give,s in return, collects wealth and withholds it
frmn people, and spends but never in charity. Moreover, he L~ 11 greedy miser
who collects money and abstains from spendi og it in goodness. As a result.

-in the Hereafter is more .severe =d ,more enduring, as demortstrated in
the Glorious Qur'An. This is be,cause riba is a prohibited gai n that c;auses a

Selling Assets

Assets include houses, lands and trees. It can he safely said 'that whatever
is related to these assets when sold, is for the buyer, and whatever is J1ot
related to these items remains the property of the seller. When bot b the
buyer and the seller are acquainted with these rulings, they will settle any
dispute that may arise between· them. They will also recognize each one's
duties and obligatfons. This is because Islam has not left a matter in which
there may be a benefit for Muslims or harm but has demonstrated it. Besides,
jf the rulings of'Islam are prnperly applied, an)' conflicts or disputes will be
properly settled. One of these matters is selling an item while there are other
items related to it; auxiliary, complementary or installations attached to or
detached from this sold item. Besides, the sold item may be of a continuous
growth (e.g.. selling a piece o[ land containing a certain crop that can be
harvested for many times; so there is a continual gain) and may not be like
that. All ofthese matters may cause a dispute between the buyer and the seller,

Selling Fruits

Fruits are whatever date palms or other kinds of trees carry of edible
ripe produce. One of the rulings on selling fruits is that it is impermissible
to sell the fruits on trees before the appearance of ripeness. This is because
the Prophet (PBUH) forbade the sale of fruits until they are ripe (free from
blight). He forbade both the seller and the buyer such a sale'. Thereupon, the
Prophet forbade the seller from selling his fruits before they become ripe and
free from any blight lest he should devour the buyers money unjustly. The
Prophet (PBUH) also forbade the buyer from that kind of transactions since
he would thus helf the seller in devouring money unjustly. It is also stated
in the Two S.ab.ihs that the Prophet (PBUH) forbade selling fruits until they
are almost ripe. When he (PBUH) was asked about the signs of ripeness. he
replied, "They get red or yellow (fit for eating)." ' The forbiddance in the two
above-stated hadiths indicates the invalidity of any transaction concluded
before the signs of ripeness appear.

52

I TRADE TRANSACTIONS

Beside!,, it is impe1,miss'ible to sell plants until they are almost full-grown
(safe from blig.hl). This is according lo the l!adith related by Imam Muslim on
the authority of lbn • Umar, stating:
"The Messenger <i/ Allah (PBUI-JJ forbade selling date paJms imt ii
!he dates ,ire almost ripe, and (he forbade selling) ears of com until
they are white and safe from blight. He forbade both the seller and
the buyer from mch sale.'"1
This [iadith proves that· lt is forbidden to sell plants until they are almost

full-grown, that is by becoming while (c;1rs of .:orn) and safe from ;iny plant
disease-. Tbe wisdom behind forbidding the sale of fruits.until the)' arc almost
ripe and of plants untll they are almost foll-grown, is that .they are subjected,
before their rip~ness and full growth, to plant diseases and damage. The
Prophet (PBUH) demonstrates this by saying,
"If,!!I/ah destroyed the fruits (pre~ml 011 the trees), what right wo1//d
one ofyou //av~ to take the n1oney of his (Muslim) bro/her?" ;
He has also forbidden usfrbm sellingean; of com ''until tliey are white and
safe from blight." 'Btig,ht' here. means any p13nl d.ise.ase which may aftlict plants
r~ulting in their destruction. This Prophetic lnjunctlon is verily a mercy for
people,Md ~ me,u,s of preservi ,1g thci r money :is well as preventing any conflict
that may arise among them, and which may lead to animosity i!nd hatred.
There.by, ii manifestly appears how much attention Islam pays to the sanctity
offhe Muslim's property; The Prophet {PBUH) says;
•
•

"lfA/111/, destroyed thejh1its (prese-111 on the trees), wit'1 what right
would you (the seller) take t/1e money ofyour (Muslim) brother?"
III this hadith, there is a warning for whoever r·esort5 to t:ricl-y methods for
taking people's money unl11wfully. Thi; b.adltli also urges the Muslim to ensure
the. safety of his money and keep away from wasting it, as the Prophet (Pl:IUH)
forbade the buyer from buying fruits until they arc almost ripe and free fron1
bl ighL This i$ becalUie if these fruits were d,m~ged and their money was paid by
the buyer, the buyer's money would be lost or it would be difficult to return iL
lt becomes clear from the nbove-mentioned hadith that the Prophetic
prohibition of selling fruits until the.y are almost ripe indicates making the
ruiing dependent on the most probable condition. In other words. it is more
probable that fruits be damaged before ripeness; lberettpon, i1 becomes
impermissible l'o sell ihe111, While, the most probable condition is that fruits

Ch•pter 8: Selllng Fru11s

53

be safe fro·m blight ilfter their ripeness, and therefore it becomes permisstble
to sell them. Moreover, it can be understood fron:1 the same /.J.4dit/i that i\ i&
impermis.~ible for one to expose one's money to danger or waste, even if both
parties agree that there will be n sort 0£ compensation for tht! .Jam aged &µits,
which is considered an unsafe procedure.
Due to the above, lt is impermissible to seli frlt11s before they are almost
ri.Pe, namely fruits can be sold alone without the trees (carrying them)
provided that these fruits are left (oo i:he trees) until they are ripe before being
sold. However, if these fruits ate sold along with the trees or sold in thdr
present condition ,(i.e., before ripeness). this becomes permissible according
to three cases mentioned and demonstrated by the Jaqllrs (may Allah have
mercy on them).
l'irst: I! is permissible to sell fruits before they become ripe with their

trees, 'That is, fru'its become par:t uf the sold item (their trees). '!'he
same applies to the selling of the unripe plants along with the land, ns
the unripe plants belong to the land 'in this case.
Second: It is permissible to sell the fruits or unripe plal)ts before

becoming ripe or full-grown to the owner of the land ot the fq,Hs.
This is because if those fruits are sold to the owner, tl\en he gets, tbe
fruits or the undpe plants fully, as- h·e is the aclual owner. Though
this kind of selling is valid, lt is,a debatable issue since some scholars
maintain lhat this case implidtly falis under the general meaning of
'the Ptophetic injunction forbiddi11g !l,w sule,of fruits before lhey are
almost ripe.
Third: It is permissible to sell fruitS"and plants (ears of corn for example)

before their ripeness •a nd full growth 011 the condition that the)',are
picked or cut immediately after the sale, and that the buyer can
:make use of them at that time. This is becau.~e the Prophet (PBUH)
forbade the sale of fruits (and the like) before they are altnosl ripe for
fear that !hey may get damaged or blighted; however, this will not be
the case when fruits and plants are picked or cut Immediately after
concluding the sale. By contrast, if the fruits and .plants will be of no
use, if they are c11~immediutely after concluding the sale, selliqg them
becomes impermissible, This is bec~nse tlli.s leads IO damage. and
waste of one~ tnoney, while the Prophet lPBUH) forbade· wasting

Yer, a,cording to the smmdest view ofscholacs in this regard, it is permissible

Blighted Fruits: Rulings
Blight refers to any plant disease affecting fruits resulting in their destruction. In this regard, fruits may be sold when they are almost ripe, and it
is permissible to sell them, and after that, they may be hit by blight. Divine
Blights refer to matters that are, beyond the powers of human iillervention,
such as wind, heat, drought, rain, coldness, locusts, etc. If the buyer then could
not collect the fruits before being afflicted, the buyer is allowed to take whatever amount of money he had p;1id for those blighted fruits. This is due to the
badfth narrated by Jilbir Ibn 'Abdullah {may Allah be pleased with him) and
related by Im~m Muslim, stating: that the Prophet {PBUH) has commanded 10
1
return the payment of those (fruits) struck with a blight •
The aforementioned !J.adtth signifies that the blighted fruits belong to the
seller and the buyer is to take whatever price he has paid for them. Thus, if
all the (sold) fruits are blighted,. the buyer is to be repaid whatever payment
he has given, but if some of th.ose fruits are blighted, he is to ask only for
what is equal to the value of th,: blighted fruits. This is based on the general
meaning of the above-mention,ed l!adith. This also applies whether the sale

56

I TRADE TRANSACTIONS

has been concluded before the tipeness of the fruits or afterwards, according
to general meaning of this badith and ati::ording to the {y.iditl, in which the
Prophet (PBUH) says:
"How oauld

you take t/te money o fyour (M11slim) brother without

II rfgiJ/?ol

However, if tlie blighted quantity of the-sold frllits is little and could
n ot be exactly defined, the buyer.and not the seller; is to bear itsTespon$ibility, since this is common among products. Moreover, this damaged
quantity is not considered blight and cannot he avoided; for example.
it may happen when birds eat from frui ts or what may drop on the
ground and the like. In this respect, scbola.rs maintain that this quantity
is not to be regarded as a blighted produce as Jong as the damage does
not reach the third of the whole quantity. Yet, the most preponde-rant
opinion is that the amount i's not to be determlned in this manner; but
H is to be decided according to the common convention among people
in this regard. This is because deciding a certain quantity necessitates
the presence of a proof.
Scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) maintain that the seller should
hear lhe responsibility of the blighted fruits because when the seller sells the
fruits on the trees l>y leaving them to the buyer, fruits are oot actually handed
over. In other words. .it is as ifhe has not given him those fruits from the st-art.
This-applies to the fruits struck with a divine blight.
However; if the fruits are damaged by way of a human cause, such as
a fLre (started willfully), the buyer is to be given the choice between two
things. The first is nbrogatlng the sole and asking the seller to repay what
he has paid. The seller should then ask the person who caused dam'\ge
to bea r the responsibility for what he has damaged. Tbe second option is
concluding the sale and asking the one who has caused the damage to give
compensation.
The Prophet (PBUH) stipull\ted that fro.its are not to be sold until they
are almost ripe. Actually, the signs through which trees other thaa palm are
known to have .reached ripeness difrer according to each kind of trees. As for
grapes, the sign of ripeness is when their taste becomes sweet. This is due
10 the lladitlt narrated by Alias that t:be Prophet (!'BUH) forbade the sale of
grapes until they become blade (ripen) '- (RelaL~d by hnilm Ahmad with a

This b.adit/i proves that the salam is pe.rcmi.ssible when these conditions
are fulfilled Besides, Ibnul-Mundhir and other scholars report that scholars
1
Uniformly <\gree that t.he salam is permissible • Moreover. people need the
salam, since one of the parties ofthe t·r;ms~ction may be in ,need for being paid
the price ofar, ltem in advance while the other may be in need for buying an
item fora cheap price.
In addition to the conditions of selling, there are some conditions neces~ry for validatiQg the salam:

First: The sold item whose pri,e is to b~ paid in advai1re must bl)ve
definite properties. Tbis is because items whose properties c.innot be
defined undergo many changes, which c.iuses disputes between the two
parties of the sale (at the rime of receiving the sold item). Thereupon,
the salam is not valid in items whose properties !Ili!Y change. such as
pulses, leather, utensils and jewels.
Second; The kind and the class of the sold item must be defined. For
example, if ihe sold item is wheat, the kind must be defined, which
1& wheat here, and the class of that wheat must be deffoed such as
As-salamtmf (a type of'wheat).
Third: The sold item must he a specified quantity, weight or measure.
This is according to the meaning of the }laJit/1 in which the Prophet
(PBUH) sars:

"Whoever pays in lldvtthce the price of 4 thing to be delivered later
should pay it for a specified measure, or a spectfied weight a111;l for
a specified period."
(Related by Al-Bukhari and M\JS)im}

a,.p,er 10: The .~11/,,n, .(S•lc of r ~yment in Advance)

61

Besides, if the quantity of the sold item is unspecified, it beoome.s
diffkult to be ex.icL
Fourth: There must be a specl fied period for receiving tlie sold item, This
is because the Prophet s.ays in the ~bove-mentioned fladit/,, ''. ..for a
specified period." Besides, Allah, Exalted be He, says:

•o you who have believed, when you contrQct o tkbtfor a specified
term, write it dow11 ...';
(Qur'An: Al-Baq_arah, 282)
With regard to this issue, both the had/th and the noble verse stale Iha\
in the salam both parties agree to the condition stating that the sold
Item is to be delivered later according to n specified period known to
both of them.

Fifth: The item sold must hi! present When the time of reception is due, in
order to be delivered at the stipulated time, Thereby, if th.a t item is not
avail.at,le when its time of delivery is due, the salam does not become
valid, such !IS paying' the price of ripe dates and grapes 111 advance and
stipulating that the sold item be delivered in winter, (such crops are
not available at such a time).
Sixth: The price of the sold item must be paid fully in advance al the time
of ooncludtng the contract. This js according to the had/th ia which
the ,Prophet (?BUH) says:

"Whoever pays in advance the price of a tiring to be delivered later
should p11y it for II specified measure.. ,"
ln this connection, l.mamAsb-Sh.ui' i (m,1y Ai1ah have mercy on
h1m) said:

"Tire transaction ()_( the salam is not l'alid, except when the price is paid
in 11dvat1ce m11l before the two parties (the seller and the·buyer) leave the
place where they have concluded tlte transaction, Besides, if the pr·ice of
the sold1tem is not paid at tire time of coliduding the cohtrnct, ft will b,:
rego.rded as selling a dtbt for a debt, wl1ic/1 is impermissible."
Seventh: The sold. item rs not to be spedtk (e.g. a certai11 house or a
specified tree). Rather, it should be regarded a debt in the seller's
liaoiiity. Thereby, the su/4m is not valid when specifying a certain
lwuse or a certa1n free io be given, be.:ause tl\is tree or house may get
damaged before being deliveled ro the buyer. In this way, the desired
purpose for which the salam has been decreed will not be fulfilled.

as

i TRADE TI<ANSACI'IONS

62

Besides, the deJlverry of the sold item is to be in the same ptace where
the contract of the salam 'has been concluaed, if possible. 1f this place is not
fit for delivery (e.g. they conclud~d I.he cortltaccJ. at a certain spot on land
or al ~ea), Lhen the place of ddivery must be mentioned ill the contract
Moreover, ·if the two parties agree on the place of delivery, the salam becomes
permissible. Otherwise; they must resort to the place where the contract has
heen concluded, for It wasfil for concluding the transaction from the start, as
mentioned before.
One of the- rulings on the snlam ls that it is impermissible to sell the item
sold according to I.he salam 10 someone else (by the huyer) before it is received.
This is becall$e the Prophet (PBUH) forbade selling foodstuffs before receiving
them', lri this case. the hawlllilli' is invalid, 6ince the l111w'1.lah is only valid
regarding a stable de.bl while I.be salatn can then be annulled.
Another rulii,gon the stJlam is tbat ifthe sold item is not present or avail.able
at the due time, sucb as In cases wheri the trees have not born frµitsat the year
of delivery, the one who has paid for the item in aavancemay clioose whether
to wait until the fruits are available, or he may ask for annulling the contract
and ask for the n1oney he has paid. This ls becau.se in case the controct is
11nnulled. it is obligatory for the seller lo repay the price paid in advance.1f the
payment given by the bu)'& against the sold item i~ damaged, a compensation
for it must be paid. And Allah, Exalted be He, knowsj,est.
1n fact, allowing su,h a kind of Lransa,t lous is a sign of the facilitation

and beoevoience by which (1u1· Sharl'ah i;; characler,ized. This is because the
sal11m Facilitates many things for people and helps them do what benefits
them . l!esides, the salam does not i!lvolve rib/I or the like of other forbidden
transactions.All praise is due 10 Allilh for the facllltntion He grants.

Loani.J1g and Loans
The loan means paying an amount of wealth to someone who wants to
benefit from it, and then he pays it back later. This is considered a kind of
utility so the Prophet (PBUH) c;alls it mani/1ah' ' as the borrower benefits from
it and then pays it back to the knder.
Lending is desirable and i,s greatly rewarded by Allah. as the Prophet
(PBUH) says:

"No Muslim lends a loan to a11other Muslim twice but it will be like
giving it once in charity."
(Related by Ibn Majah)'
It is said that lending a loam is legally better than giving charity, as none
borrows except when being in a bad need. In a ~aflill (authentic) l!adith, the
Prophet (PBUH) says:

"He who relieves a Muslim from hardship Allah will relieve him from
the hardships (to which he would be put) on the Day of Resurrection."'

So, lending is considered a good deed as it relieves a Muslim from ha(dship
and meets his bad need. Hence, borrowing is not a detestable act, for it
happened that the Prophet (PBUH) borrowed. This is related ;md 111.tted in
many l:!adiths al;>out the Prophet (PBUl-1)'.
Moreover, the loan mus1t be from someone whose loan rs, legal ( valid); it
is impermissible for the guairdian of an orphan; for example, to take frtim the
orphan's money in ord'e r to lend others. The amount and quality of the loan
must be known and defined. in order to make the receiver able 10 p.ay ~ back.
A loan is considered a debt u1pon the liobiUty ofits receiyer, and then he has to
return it, without delay, as soon as he can afford it.
In addition, it is prohibi.ted upon the lender to stipulate any increase to
his loan. Stholats unanimously agree that if the knder stipulates any increase
and takes it, ii is considered rib4.. Nowadays, banks lend money stipulating
:art interest on money; which is plairi rlba, whether the loan is the so-called
consumer or ,developmental Joan. lt is impermissible for t he lender (a bank,
a person, or a company) to take a stipulated increase regardless of the name
given to, it (profit, interest, gift), or to make use of a utility against the loan
-such as staying in a house 01: using a,cnr, As long as this profit, gift, or utility
is obtained through stipulat ion, it is cousidered impermissible. The Prophet
(PBUH) says:

Anas (mai• Aliah be pleased with ,bim) 11am11ed '1;hat the Prnphei (PBUH) said:

'Th·ere are rnany similar narrations of this bodfl/1,
furthermore, it is related ,about· Abdullah Ibn Salam (may Allah bepJeased
with him) thal he said:

"{fsomeone irrdel,ted to you gives you a lo.ad ofhay as a gift do· 1101,
accept it, for ii is riba."
This tradition is viewed by scholars as a fladftli narrated about the Prophet
(PBUH). Thus, it is hrtpermissible for the leildet to.accept a gift or any form

of utility from the debtor. Such a profit is prohibited since lendi1Jg is supposed
tG> be a kind ofleniency on behalf of the Muslim lender towards the needy
debtor, am! also a means to draw near to Allah. So, if the lender stipulates or
anticipates a profit, then he violates the aim of lending; that ts ,t o draw ·near to
Allah·through relieving the needy instead of seeking a profit from him; as it
will not be considered a good loan.
TherE,fore, Muslims must avoid ~iicJi liansactions that may UJVolve riba.
Moreover, they must h ove good intentions, .as regards giving loans and
doing other good deeds. That (s, the purpose of giv'ing loans is noi ·directed
to material gains; rather, it is a means of .gaining a moral benefit through
drawing near to Allah, This can be attained by relieving the needy wi1bout
gaining any profit If a Muslim lender intends to relieve the needy, Allah will
bless his money.
It is worth mentioning that the prohibited profit is the stipulated one.. For
example, the lender may stipulate that he gets bQck his money with such and
such amoun~•of money as due interest, makes o.u;e of a house or a &hop of the
borrower, or gets a gift from him. Jt is also forbidden that the lender u)t~nds
or anticipates taking an increase even if lie·does not stipulate such an incre.ise,
However, if there is some iocrease given to the lender simply as an act of
~bowing kindness from the bortower not by means of stipulating, therelis no
harm in that as it is considered of the better w:iys of repaying Joans. Once. the
Prophet (PBUH) gave a choice camtl in return for a s mall camel that he had
received as a loan. Then he (PBUH) said:
"The best amongst you is Ire who pa)IS /he fights of othus hatfdsomely."1
According to the,Shar/'ah (Islamic Law) and,common convention, paying
the ri'ghts of others hand'somely is amimg the good manners and' it is not
among the p rohibited loans that beget b1mefi1s. as long as such an increase
is neither stipulated nor anticipated by the lender, buf it is simply a donation
from the borrower. Likewise, it Is pearussible for tile lender to accept a benefit
which the·borrower used to give him befor~ the loao as loog ·as ii is not given
to him because of the loan.

The borrower mu.st-pay ba.:ld he lo-an without1>rocrastination or delay !II'

However, some people are remls~ in glving the rights of orhets especiallr

Mortgage

Mortgaging refers to the security for a debt against an article that can cover
it or its value (in case of non-fulfillment).
Mortgaging is permissible according to the Noble Qur'an, the Sunnah
(Prophetic Tradition) and the consensus of Muslim scholars. Allah, Exalted
be He, says:

''. .. And ifyou are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then
a security deposit [sl,ould be] taken ..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 283)
When the Prophet (PBUH) died, his armor had been mortgaged'. Scholars
unanimously agree that mortgaging is permissible on journeys and the majority
of scholars maintain that mortgaging is also permissible in residence. The
wisdom behind the legality of mortgaging is to keep properties and protect
them against loss.

Allah, Exalted be He, cnmniands Muslims to write down the ,debts as
He says:

"d you who have be/i,eve4, whe11 you contract a debt fot a specified

(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 282)

(Qur'an: AI-Baqarah: 283 J
Such permissibility is considered of the mercy of Allah upon His servants
as He gui,;les them to what b1!11efits them.
The amount, quality, and description of the collater,al inust be known. The
debtor must be legally permitted 10 contract; he must possess the collateral or

It is permissible t.o mortgage the purchased ,article for its price, as this

buys a house or a c11.r on credir or in cash hut tlie price is not paid yet, he
ls permitted lo mortgage lt so 11s lo pay its price to the sellet. However,
neither the debtor nor the creditor Is permitted to dispose of the collateral
except after getting the ·permission of the other. If either of them disposes
of the coUater3l, he causes a loss to the other. Thati&, if the debtor disposes
of the collateral without the ,;:reditor's permis-s1on, he deprives him from
securing the deal. Similarly, if the creditor disposes of the collateral
(without the debtor's permission), he will be,disposing of a property•that
does not belong to him.
Concerning making use of the collateral, it is to be according to what the
two parties (the debtor and the•creditor) agree on. So, if they agree on renting
or concluding any other transactions with regard to the collateral, it will be
permissible, However, if they do not agree (to make use of the collateral), the
collateral remains S\ISpended until it is rtde~m~d. Tti.e debtor ls to b11 made
able to maintain and keep the collateral; for e.11ample. watering, pollinati'ng.
and lteating the trees, as this is done for the benefit of the collateral.
The ~tofags received from the coOateral ,~hether by itself (such as an
aninlal when,it•becomes fatter or is abie to.do some work) or through itsproduct
(&uch as offspring, wooi and whatever is begotten.from it) are considered pa.H
of the col4iteral that can be sold with._the tollateral fur fulfilling the debt. The
same ruling applies to the crops of a mortgaged land. Besides, if there is any
damage caused to the collateral, the coaipensation for thi5 damage is to be
joined to th.e collateral, as it is a substitut.e for part of it.
The debtor must provide the expenditures of the collatenu,This is because
Sa' td Jbnul-Musayyab reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may AJlah
be pleased with them) th11.t the Prophet (PBUH) said\

"When someone mot tgag/!5 (.111 item, it is not to be foreclosed; any

This is because the coUateral is the property of the debtor and it is his
responsil,ility to provide whate'Wr it requires for its maintenance. Also, it is the
responsibility of the debtor to pay the rent of the store where the collateral is

Guarantee

Guarantee is one of the legal ways to record debts. ln Islamic terminology,
it is the guarantor's commitment to pay back the debt of another person while
this person is still considered the original debtor. In this case, the guarantor
must fulfill the obligations of the debtor. For example, the guarantor may say
to the creditor, "I guarantee the debt of so and so." Guarantee is permissible
according to the Noble Qur'an, the Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition), and the
consensus. Allah, Exalted be He. says:
"... and for he who produces it is [the reward of] a camel's load,
and I am responsible for it."
(Qur'an: Yl1suf: 72)

The word "responsible" implies that this person is a guarantor.
Imam At-Tirmidhi relates, as a marfu ' (traceable) l1adith, that the Prophet
(PBUH) says:
"The guarantor is responsible for (paying) the thing he guaranteed."'

74

I TRADE TRANSACTIQNS

Scholars unanimously .igree thal guarantee 1s generally permissible. The
interests and needs of peopk necessitate the pennlssibility of a guarantee, as it
is a means ofµ>operatio11 in righteousness and piety so as to relieve Muslims
from difficulties.
In order to maintain the validity of the guarantee. the guarantor must be
legallY' permitted to dispose of his assets since guarantee is a fonn of-financial
oblig~tion. So, a child or a weak-minded intercllcted of his-legal capacity ls not
-permitted to be a guarantor. Moreover, the guarantOPmust accept (willingly ),to·
bear this liability, and ifhe is forced to do so, then the guamntee becomes void.
Since. liability is a voluntary declaration to fulfill an obligation. a guarantor's
consent is obligatory; as is th.e case of financial donation.
Furthermore, guarantee i's a kind of b~nevolence to benefit and help the
guaranteed person, so it is impermissible to talte compensation out of it. That
is, compensation resulrhtgfr.:imguaranteeisasprohlbitedas a benefit resulting
from a loan, The guarantor must pay the debt on behalf of the guaranteed
pecson when time is due for the creditor· to i!Sk for lt. When the guarantor
pays the debt, he is. permitted affe~wards to take back the same amount of
money from the guaranteed person 1~ithont any interest, since guarantee is
legally intended to show lenliency nrtd help the needy, not to exploit artd place
butdtns upon theni.
Gqarantee is valid whe:n the guar~ntor gives his -consent by whatever
words i'(ldicate this, such as "I am responsible for IJiis debt:' "I guarantee this
1
debt:' "This debt fs on my liability;• and the like, since the Lawgiver does
not necessitat<t a &pedfic phrase to be said and it depends on the common
convention of the society.
The creditor has the right to ask the gi.t\lrantor 0 1: the guaranteed person to
get his money back as·il is a debt on the liabHlty of both of them. The Prophet
(PBUH) says:

'T /leguarantor 1s respw1sible for (paying). t/u thing he guaranteed."
(Related by Abu Dflwild and At-Tin11idh1 who .grades 11 a l1asa11

This is the opinion of the majority of sdtolars. However, ~ome scholars are
ofthe·npinion that tbe creditor has no right to <1sk rhe guarantor to pay him
except when it Is difficult m 11sk the- guaranteed person for the debt. 1bis is
because a guarantor is legalhr considered subsidiary to the original debtor, and
he is not to be asked for anylhing except when it i$ impossible to get the debt

from the debtor. Guarnntee, like mortgaging, Is a wny to guarantee the right of
the treditor; the collaternl i~ not to be taken by the mortgagee except when .t he
rnortgager cannot pay bade the debt ar its due time. It is no1 acceptable to as.k
the guarantor for the debt as long as the guaranteed person canbe found and is
able to,pa)', According to common convention, the creditor asks the guarantor
for the debt only when Lhe guaranteed is not found or when he is unable to pay
lt back. This is the meaning implled by lbnul-Qayyitn who concludes, ''. .•This
is the preponderar1t view ns you see."'
The liability of the gLrarantor is not absolved until the llability of the
guaranteed petson is discharged whether by pa}'ing back his debt to the
creditor otby being excused byhin.L
Moreover, it is permissible for •t he debtor to,have a number of guarantor,;c
whether every guarantor claims li9bility pn the whole debt or on only part ofit.
However, the responsibility of each. of the guarantors is ,wt absoh•ed unlil the
responsibilities of all of them are discharged or when the respQnsibil.ity 0£ the
guaranteed person is absolved. 11 is not necessary for the guarantot to know
the guaranteed person to mak~ liis guarantee valid. T he guatantor can simply
say to the creditor, "I gunrantee the person ,vho is indebted to you'.' Likewise,
it is not necessary for the guarnntor to know the creditor as the consenl Or
knowledge of either the creditor or the mmran teed person is not OijCe&sary to
make the guarantee valid. In addition, it is permissible to -guarantee a known
umouot or an unknown amollot if it is to be known afterwards, as AUah,
l:.,ulted be He, says:

"... and for Ire !<'ho prod,,ces ii is {tire reward r,JJ a camel~ load,
and l a111 respo11siblefo-r it.''
(Qur'ful: Yl'.lsuf. 72)
This i.s because a camel'!.load is unknown at first but then becomes known.
This verse implies the .permissibility of guaranteeing a kno1Vll amount or an
unknown amount if it is to be known afterwards.
It is permissible :for the guarantor to bear the seller's re~-pon~ibility if !he
comniodity turns oul to be possessed by someone else, ,'\lsQ. il is permissib\e
for a Musllm person lo guarantee the obli.gations of someoJ\e else, such as

Suretyship (Kafalah)
Surctyship (Kafel/ah) is one's commitment to present the indebted person
to the creditor. So, suretyship concerns the guaranteed person himself and
it is valid for anyone in debt. No suretyship is permissible for prescribed
punishments bec.iuse suretyship depends on certainty while prescribed
punishments are not to be executed when combined witb suspicious proofs.
In addition, suretyship does not apply in a case oflegal retribution as it is to be
executed only on the offenders. It is impermissible to execute legal retribution
on a surety when the one guaranteed cannot be found.
The surety must give his conse.n l in order to make suretyship valid, as he
is not obliged to bear the responsibility of suretyship. The obligation of the
surety is legally abs.olved if the guaranteed person dies. Likewise, the surety
is legally absolved when the guaranteed person submits himself before the
creditor at the due time and place since he then fulfills the obligation of the
surety. However, if the surety cannot present the guaranteed person at the due
time or if the guaranteed person has been absent for a long period during

C1'RA.0ETAANSAGTIONS

zs

which he could have been presented., then the surety must guarantee the debt.
This is according to the general meaning of the l?rophe!ic aaci1tlt in which he
(PBUH) says;

'The guarantor (here the surety) is responsible for (paying) the 1/,ing
heguaranteed."'
It is permisslMe to guarantee the acci.uaintance of a person. For example,
a per.son comes to borrow money from another and the latter says, "I do not
Tmow you, so I will nor lend you~ lben a third person says, "l guarantee my
a(qua.lntanee of him to you" meaning "I know who he is 3i'!d where he llves''.
In such a case, the surety (who guarantees the 11cquaintance of the guaranteed
person) is not only required to mention the name and adclress ofthe guaran teed,
but·he must also present him lo the creditor. If the guaranteed person is alive
nnd the surety cannot present him io the creditor, the surety must guarantee
the debt (Pi\Y lt back) as he is the one who h<1s guaranteed the acquaintance of
the debtor (1he guar;1.r1teed person) and persuaded the creditOF to lend him.
Such an acquaiota.nce is li~e saying, ..., guarantee to present the debtor to you
whenever you want.'.'

Hawalah (Transference of Debts)

The faqim define b.awtilah as the transference of a debt from the liability
of the debtor to the liability of anothe.r person. The transference of debts
is permissible aod approved by the Su1111ah (Prophetic Tradition) and the
consensus. The Prophet (PBUH) says:

"If the debt of one ofyou is transferred (from your debtor) to a rich
debior; he should agree.'''
The same b.adith is narrated with a slight difference in wording as:

"Whoever is transferred (fr·om his debt:or) to a rich debtor, should
nl
agree.
Many scholars maintain that: there is a consensus on the permis.5ibility
of the transference of debts, The: transference of debts is a kind of leniency
legally intended to facilitate the transactions of people and help them meet
their needs, pay back their debts and be comfortable.

80

I TRADE. TRANSACTibNS

Some people think that the permissibility of the transference of debts does
not accord with analogical deduction. They allege that it is a kind of selling 11
debt for another debt, which ts forbidden. l-!owever, the great scholat Jbm1lQayylm argues against this opinion and affirms that the permissibilily'of the
transference of debts is not an exception as it is a kind of paying back debts not
ofselling. He says:
"Even ifthe transference ofdebts is a kirid ofselling a debtjot another,
the Lawgiver does not prohibit it since the prindples of the Shari· ah
(Islamic Law) nece$sila(e the permissibility to transfer a debt from /he
liability ef tile original debtor to the liability of a new one (substitute
debtor)."'
'There are some legal conditions on the transference of debts to make it
valid..They are as follows:

First 'The debt must be undeF the responsibility of the substitute debtor
since ·the transference of debt~ oblig~ the substitute debtor to pay
the debt back. lf the debt ls not yet deteqnlned to b!! u_nder the
respon5ibility- of the origiu;u debtor, i ts transference is not valid as ir
can be canceled. For ex.ample, It is not legal to transfer the p:rice ofa
purchased article 115; long as it ts still subject to approval. .Also, a s9n
c,annot tramfer his ,.lebt to \'lte creclit of his father unless his father
gives his consent.
Second: The substitute debt must be identical to the transferred debt
with regard to the kind, e.g. diihams for dirhams. Likewise, the
substitute debt and the transfened debt must be equal with regard tit
the description, e.g. Saudi currency for $aucli currency. Also, the two
debts must have the same time for due payment; whether- they are to
be paid in cash or on creclit That is, the transference of debts is not
valid if one debt is ·paid ln cash nnd the other is·on credit, or if the due
time of one debt is after a month while th" time of the other is after two
months. Besides, the amnwns of the two debts must be the J;ame: it is
impermissible to transfer a debt of one hundred riyuls, for ~pie.,
for another debt ofo11ly ninety riyals. ] his is because the transference
of debts, like lending loans, is intended to be a kind ofleniency not
a means to ga1n profit Hence., if there is any difference in the value
between the two debts, fhis will vloiate the l~l objective of the
tmnsference of debts, which ls leniency; and set instead the objective
of gaining interests which is impermissible in the trao~ference.nfdebts

CJ,a.prcc 15: Hm.QJ/,ti, (Tt11mkrcnce of Delm)

81

and in lending loans. However, l1 is permissible for tbe original debtor
to transfer only parl of his debt to the cred'it of a substitute debtor,
or to transfer his de.bl to the credit of sorneoJ1e Owing him more
than tbe origin'\l (lebt, and the remaining debt i.n each case ls still
due for its creditor.
Third: The consent of the ·original debtor is necessary here, as he ts

not obliged to pay back his debt through transference. However,
the consent o( the creditor is not necessary. Also, the consent of the
creditor is not neccssarr :in ordrr to transfer the debt to the crel}ir
of a rich person who fa not procrastinating. Rather, such a creditor
most be forced to accept the transference of the debt aJJd then he-has
the right to claim his loan from the substitute debtor: Tbe Prophet
(PBUH) says:

•ttProcrastination ( delay) fnpaying debts by a weal1ftyperso11 is injustice.
So, if tlie debt of oue ofyou is transferre.i (from your de/,1or) lo c, rich
debtor, lie should agree."
(Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
lt1 another narration of thfs badftll, the wording is:

"Whoever is tra11eferred Jjrom his debtor) ta a rlclt debtor, should agr,:e."
This means that Lite creditor should agree on the trnnsft!rence of
his debt. If the substitute debtor is not able to fulfill the debt or may
procrastinate, th~n the creditorisµotobligecl toagreeto the transference
of the debt to that persori,as this may damage his interests.
In this respect, the indebted persons who are able to pay- back should
hasten to be absolved by paying back their debto to the original Cn!ditors
01· the substitute credltors for whom the debt becomes entitled thl'(ll/gb
rtansference. The indebted persons should not ruin their reputations
through procrastination. Often. we hear the creditots' coruplaiolli
·when th~y $Offer from the illegal delay and negl1gence of the debtors
in paying back their debts. Also, we frequently hear the creditors'
complaints owlng to the procrastination of the tich substitute debtors
in payfng back their due tr;msfe.rred debts, sinc.e they amse a lot of
difficulty to the creditors. This has rn.ide the transference of debts 11
repulsive matter which many people dislike because oFthe injus!ke of

When rhe transference of debt&meets lts aforementioned legal conditions,
rhe debt transfers from the liability of I.he origlnal debtor to the fiabilit)'. of a

the transferenct- of debts means the transference from one liabil1ty to another,
Thus, the cteditor •l s not permitted to claim his right from the original debton

Commissioning ( Wakalah)
In Islamic terminology, wakii/ah (commissioning) refers to the act in which
a legally accountable person appoints another legally accountable person to act
on his behalf in a certain matter in which such authorization is permissible.
Commissioning is permissible according to the Noble Qur'an, the S1m11ah
(Prophetic Tradition), and the consensus of Muslim scholars. Allah, Exalted
be He, says:
'~ ..So send one ofyou with this silver coin ofyours to the city..."
(Qur'an: Al-Kahf: 19)
And He says:
"[Joseph} said, 'Appoint me over the storehouses ofthe land..;'"

(Qur'an: YOsuf: 55)
And He also says:
". .. a11d for those employed to collect [Zaklih ]..."

Mor~over, rhe Proph~t (PBUH) .a11~horiied ' Urwah Ibm,J•Ja' d to buy a
ewe,' authorized Abu RMi'" to perfotm the marriage contract on his behalf
with Maymiinah,' and use,d to send his inen to collect Zakah. In addition,
AI-Muwaffuq and other scholai:s maintain that Chere is a consensw on the
permissibility of commissioning. The Wi~dom behind this permissibility is
that peoples needs necessitate lhe legality of conunissioniog since 11ot every
person can do himself whatever he needs.

What is Required in Orde:rto Make Commissioning Valid and Confirmed
Commissioning is confirmed by any statement that indicates permission
for it (e.g. ~Do so ,md so" or "I permit you to do so and so"). It is permissible
to accept commissioning [n,tantaneously or to defer it This is due to the
fact that the Prophet's representatives deferred their acceplance when )le
(PBUH) commissioned lhE:in. Furthermore, cornmissionit\g can be timed or
conditioned. For example. ·the authorize( may say to ihe represenllilive. "You
will be my representative for one month" or "When the lease period of my
house expires, you can sell iit"
l'he authorizer must designate a particular person, so commissioning
becomes voiu if the authori:ur says, •1.authorize anyone pf these two persons
to be ,ny representatlxe:' Also, commissioning becomes void if the authorizer
appoints someone whom h,r does not know.

Matters in Wbi(:h Comtlflissioning is Permissible
It is permissible for a person lo conimission another in matters in which
representation is permitted, &uch as concluding or canceling all kinds of
contracts. To clarify, -selling, buying, renting, lending loans, and speculating
,ire exa111ples of conduding transact ions, while divorce,. kl111l 1 ( the wife's
release for payment), emancipation, and cancellalion of rhe ~-ale are examples
of Cililceling the transadiom;.
Commissioning is als<I permissible in the matters relating lo Allah's
rights (some acts of worship) in which authorization on behalf of someone
is permissible. 'This is l~e the distrlbution of Zaldlh and charity, fulfillment
of vows, expiation, an<I pe,rforming liajj and ' Umroh (Lesser Pilgrimage),
~ccording to the related auth,mtic proofs in this regard. Howe,•er, de~ignaring
d representative is nor pennissible in lhe matters relating to individual ads
of worship, in which aurhori2.ation on behalf of ~omeone is not peimfssible,

such as performing prayer, fasting. and the purification of major and mi'n or·
ritual impurities, since- these acts of worship 3.l'e to be observed by the legallr
accountable persob himself.
In addition, commlssloning is pe.rmissible In investig,ltl ng ahd executing
l:he prescribed punishments as the Prophet (PBUH) said:

·•o Unays! Go to the wife oft/iis (num) and ifs/1e·c.mfesses (that s/ie
hllS committed adultery), then sfone her to death,7
(Related by AI-Bukl\art and Mu~lim)'
The authorized (commiss.ioned) person has no dght t-0 designate another
representative to act oa his behalf except in the following,matters:

Fir.si: When the authorizer permits the authorized person to do so by
saying something like, "You. can designate a .representative to act on
your behalf if you like) or (Doas you like):'

Second:lfthe designated act is not to be carried out by the,mthorized
person, as he is an honorable p·erson who 'is far above doing sut;h
an act.
Thfrd: If the authorized person is unable to q1rry out the designated work.

Fourth: Wlien the authorized person cann9t do the designated work
properly.

in the aforementioned four cases, it is impermissible for the authorized
person to des)gnate anyone except a trustworthy represe11tative.
Commissioning is permissible for both the authorizer and' the authorized
p~rson, as it is considered permission given by the authorizer aod a s~rvice
rendered by the repre9en1ative, but both are not obligalory; each 6f the
authorizer and authorized person is permitted to cancel commissioning at any
time he desires.

Matters Nullifying Commissioning
Commissioning is nullified b)r cancellation, death, or absolute madness with
reg;ud to either of the parties. This is because comn1issionfrg depends Oil tl\e
life abd sanity of both parties, so when one parw lacks either of them, it.becomes
invalid. Commissioning also becomes inv.a.lid if the amhorizer di~,h~rges J.he
authorized person, or when either of them is interdicted of his legal capacity
due to bis foolishness, (since he ~'1EJJ lacks the a11tborityof disposition).

When Commissioning Becomes Permissible
Whoever b<iS the -auth01;ty to dispose of something can atlthotize or
be auLl,orized in regard to this same thing. However, whoever has no legal
a\Jthority to dispose of soD1ething, his representative has not the authority
to dispose of this same thing, w1th greater reason. A rep1·esentative 'l"0O
is authorfied for buyh1g and selling is not permitted to sell or buy from
himself as the customs.nece$silate that a person sells 11nd buys from others
not from himself lest he sho\Jld be suspected. Likewise, he is not pernilited

to sell or buy from his son, fathe1·, wife or those whose t~stimony in his
favor rs to be rej~cted bec.:,wse rti.ere is-s uspicion of favoritism and-partiality
doe to family relations .

.Actions Related to the Authorizer and the Authorized Person
T he authorizer must fulfill some legal commitments with regard t'O transactions, such as delivering the price, receiving the purchased article, canceling
transactions for defects, asking for his rights and guaranteeing the rights of
the other party. As for the authoriz.ed person who is authorized for selling, he
may deliver the purchased article bul he is not permitted to receive the price
without the permission of his authorizer or at least a situation indicating rus
permission. For example, the authorized persoo may receive the price if he
sells the ariide in a store where the price may be lost if he does not receive
it. An authorized person who ls- authorized for buying may deliver the due
price to complete the transaction. However, the person authorized fot settling
a dispute is not permitted to re,eive the price, but the person authotized fo~
receiving the price is permitted to settle the dispute as it is the only w.1y to
receive the price.

Commibnents of the Representative
The authorized person is accolintable. But. he is not iiable for•things that

are lost ot d.\maged with him as long as.he does µot negiect or exceed llmjts
l"tlh regard to sucll items, However, if he neglects, exceeds limits or refuses,
without any legal excuse, to pay the money due for the authortz.er, he is to be
liable for what is lost or damaged and legally obliged to pay any money doe
to the authorizer. The authorized person is 10 be trusted witlJ regard to the
designated wotk whether it is selling, renting, or the like. In other W()rds, what
he says about' the price, the rent, or the damaged articles is to bQ trusted and
believed. And Allah knows bc~t.

Interdiction

Islam has been ordained to protect the properties and rights of people;
therefore, interdiction has been legalized on ones who should be prevented
from disposing of their properties.
Jurisprudentially speaking, interdiction means preventing someone from
disposing of his property. What proves that interdiction is legalized is that
Allah, Exalted be He, says in the Noble Qur'an:

~nd do not gl>'e the weak-minded your property, which Allah
has made a means of sustenance for you, but provide for them
with it and clothe tliem and speak to them words of appropriate
kindness. And test the orphans (In their abilities] until they reach
marriageable age. Then ifyou perceive in them sound judgment,
(Qur'an: An•Nisa': 5-6)
release their property to them ..."

I TRADE TRANSACTIONS

'l'hese two verses prove Jhat Allah, Exalted be He, has decreed interdic.tion
on the weak-minded and thi: orphru1s lest they should wa.qte or destroy their
properties. Moreover, both are not to be given back their property except when
they become of sound ;udgment. The Prophet (PBUH) himself interdicted some
of his Companions (and has sold some oftheir properti~s) to settle their debts'.

Interdiction Is of 1\vo Types
The Fust Type of Interdiction ls the on... imposed for safeguntding others'
share in the property of the interdicted person, .is the case of interdicting the·
insolvent person for safeguarding the share o'f the creditors in his existing
property. Por safeguarding the share ofthe heirs in the heritage, interdiction is
also imposed on the sick person to prevent him from bequeathing niore than
the third of his property.
The Second Type of Interdiction is the one imposed on the person for
his own benefit, lest he should waste his property or destroy it. Interdiction
in this case applies to th~ minor, the weak-minded and l:he insane, for All.ah,
Exalted be fie, revealed:
~nd do notg(ve tl,e weuk-mi11ded yorir proper.ly., .~
(Qur\io: An-Nisa': 5)

Some scholan; maintain Lhat those meant in this verse are the young
children and women, tbus- the guardian should not-wastefully _give them of
hls money. Other 'Scholars -are of the opinion that those meant in !he ver..e
are the we-.i)c-minded, tbe young children and llie insane persons; they are 10
be. denied the right to dispose of their pro petties lest they should waste them .
Allah, Exalted be He, m-1kes tli~ propetty - in the above-mentioned verse·
- attached to the addresseeii ", .. yo11r property.._" since they are appointed as
guardians of the property of the interdkted to protect it.

The First Type: Interdiction for Safeguarding Others' Share
This trve· of lnterdiction applies to the bankrupt, whose remaining
property is insufficient (,vhen 5old) to meet a'll his due debts. Thereupon, he is
10 be denied the right 10 dispose of his remninfng property lest he should cause
h~rm to his crt'9'itors. As for i.he insolvent debtor who is unnbleto fulfill any of
his debts, he i.s 1101 to be asked ()>y,his creditors) to pay them, but should rather
be granted a grace period until his finaocial circumstances allow hlm to pay.
With regard to this, Al'lah . .Exalted be He, says:

"He who is pleased II> be granted shwle by Allah under Ilia s/iade

Yet, discharging the insolve~•t person is better than granting him a grace

(Qur-':m: AI-Baqarah: 280)

As for the debtor who is ~ble to -settk his debts, it is impennissible to
interdit t him, since there ii; no need for 1hnl. However, if his creditors a~k him
to pay wbathe owes them, he ls to be legally ordered lo pay his debts, for the
Prophet (PBl:JH) says:

"1:'rotr,istinatlon in paying de/Its by a wealtlry man is injustice."'
Thi~ 11.aditlr signifies th"t wh,en an indebted wealthy perso,1 procrastil)ates
in pllyi ng hi.s debts, he is thus causing iujt1stic.e to his creditors since he refuses
to pay what he owes them . If the'indebted wealthy person refuses to pay his
debts, then he should be imprisoned. Tn this regurd. Sheikh Taqiyyud-Dfn lbn
Taymiyah (may Allnh have mercy on ham) satd:

''. ..As fur //,c person wlio is c,,ble to meet his debtsand.(tho11gh) ref11ses

He added:
''. .. n has not co,11e to my knowledge tlmt tirere is a disag.reemmt

In addition, Imam Ahmad, Abil Daw(\d and olher compilers ll Hqdltl,
relate that the Prophet (PBU H) ,,ays:

"Procrastination in paytng debts by II wealthy 1111m mnkes i(

The word"be dishonored" means to be complained aboul (by his creditors),

paying his debts deserve~ di~crel:ionarypunir.hmcnt and imprisonment. He is

to be repeatedly punished in this 1nar11wr unti l he folfiUs his debts. In case the
Jehtor insists on delaying hi, debts, those in aulhority are to Jnterv~ne and seU
hi• property to pay the debts he owes. '!'his is because those ln ai1thority are to
take !lie place of the person who refuses to pay his debls, in order to prevent
any h~rm to the creditors. This is according to the b.adith in which the Prophet
(PBU!,!} says:

"One should not ha-rm others n11r should 011e seek benefitfor oneself
by-caus-ing harm to otlicrs:'''
From what ha$ ~e11 deinvnstrt1te1h 1t appeacs that there nrt two sllltes of
the debtor:

The frrst state is when his debt is deferred. Thereby, he is not to be asked
to•pay it Until il is due, aot is he obliged to settle it b~fore that. In case
the debtor"s property is insufficient to meet his deferred debt, he is not
to be interdicted nor be oen[ed the right to dispose of his property.

The second state of the debtor is when his debt is due. ro ibis state.
there are two other cases of the debtor:
The first c~e is 1\/hen tbe value of the debtor's property exceeds his
payable debt, 1ri which case he is not to be interdicted, but rather be
ordered to pay bis debt when the creditocs ask for that. If the debtor
refuses to pay (upon the.creditor's demand), be is to be punished with
a discreti'onary punishment and imprisoned until he pays 'his debts.
lf the debtor bears both pw1ishments b11t still refuses to pay, those in
authority lire 10 inter,wne by 6elling from his property what suffices to
cover the debts.

'The second case is when the value of the debtor's prope11y is less ·t han
.hi5 due debt; in this case, he is lo be interdkted if hi! creditors ask for
their money lest he should cause barm to the money he owes them.
Th.i's is according to the hadith narrated by Ka •b Thn Malik (may Allah
be pleased with him) which states:
"The Messenger of Allah ( PBW) interdicted Mu ·tldh and sold fiis
p ropert}' (to /11/fill th.e debts M11 'ildh owes),"•
{Related by Ad-D3raqtl1111 ;md AI-Htikim and thelatter deems it awb.ib.

lbnu1-Salah says, '1Tliis badit/1 Is surely reporled about the ~rophet
(PBUH)," 1n this case, if the' debror is 1nterdkted, it is lo be publicly
declared lest people should be deceived by him (in financial transactions), causing their property thus to be wasted.

~prei· 17: J,uerdicdo.r\

There are 'Four Rulings on the Interdicted Pers1>n
The first ruling is that his debts are to be paid _from bis property
before being interdicted, and from whatever property that comes to
his possession afterwards, such as the money he obtains by means
of legacy, an injury compensation, a gift, a share from a will and the
like. The interdicted person is lo be denied the right of disposing of
his property possessed before and after being interdicted, Thereby,
a11y disposal of his property becomes ineffective since- the rights of
his creditors are due on .his property. Thus, he bas no sight to grant
any part of his property to anyone by uny mean•. Even before being
iuterclicted, it is prohibited for the ipdebted to dispose of bis properJ:y
in .i way lbal caoses harm .to hls creditors.
Imam lbnul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) sayb~

kif lite debtor's ,mtire property 1s requil'ed to cover his debts, it will be
Invalid for him to ,1onate thereof. in a way that causes Q/ly )1arm to
the creditors, whether I/rose i11 authority have interdicted /rim or not.
Tl1is is tile opinion maintained by J►11dm Mdlik and Slraykhul-lsldm Jbn
1a.ymiyah (may Allah have mercy on 1/im). Moreover, it is the sollndest
view which befits tire original mli11gs of the Hanball School and comes in
accordance wilf1 the principles ofShari 'ah (Islamic Law) qnd its ru/f11gs.
Tfiis is b~c,:iuse the cretfi(ors' rights must be pa_id from the debtor's entire
property. That is wiry those i11 attthority interilfct the debtor. If fhe
creditors' money were not to be paid from tire debtors entire property,
those in authority would not have the right lo interdict him. Therefore,
his CQSe resembles that oftlte person 011 1/Je deathbed as he is not allowed
to dispose of his property. If the indebted person were given the .legal
rlgln to donate, this wottld waste the creditors' rights, a11d the Sharl ·.a h
,,ever legislates something like this, f or among //re principles ofShari 'ah
is safeguarding people's rights.by all ways a11d blocking means leading to
, h ,.,
wast.mg t em.

The second ruling is when a creditor finds th every piece ofmercha11dis1:
he has ,sold lo a bankrupl person or bas given him as a loan or ao a
rented artide before interdictlon, in which case the creditor is allowed
to take itback Thfs,is,because the Prophet (PBUH) says:
·11 a. man finds his very things with a bankrupt person, the1, lie has
more right to take them back than,anyo11e else.~
(Related by Al-Bukh.\ri and Muslim)'

l TRADE TRANSACTIONS
1n additio11,f11q/11s (may Allah have mercy on them) have stipulated six
conditions for taking backau amount of money (a property or a piece of
merchandise} given io the bankrapt person before he is. interdltted.
The first condition is that the bankrapt person pe alive until the
owner of the ·piece o fanerc.handise takes back his propertyfrgm him,
for Abu DaWild related that the Pr(lphet ('PBUH} said,
~ .. If.he (tire b,mkr11pt u11ye,·) dies, then the owner ofthe property (i.e,

the uller) Is II) be t reated equally like ·t he creditors (with regard to
dlstr/bulii1g J/;e estnl:e)."
The second condition is tbal the bankrupt person still uwes the whole
price. Thereby, if the owner oflhe,propcrt)' ts p.iid a part ufits price, Jt
w ill not be valid for him lo take it (the property) bock.
T he thit:d condition is that the bankrupt person still h;is the very
_property (he took from its owner). If the owner of (hat property finds
only prut of it, he is not to take it back, since he has not found all his
pie(e of me;chMdisi: but only part ofiL
The fourth conditicln is that the piece of nierchandise be intact and
nothing ofH·s propeities has changed.

The fifth condition ts fliat none has ~ny right lo claim with r~gard
to that piece of mi:rcha 11clise, for lbe bankrupt person may have
.mortgaged it or hav( used ii in any other transaction.
The sixth cond,ition1is that the piece of merchandise must nor have
increased a continual increase, as Ju the case of animals that f;,,tteu ;md
iucrease in weight•.

Ifall the above-mentioned ~onditions are fulfiUed, it becomes permissible
for the ownerofthe piece ofmerchandise to take it back frooi,the indebted
person when the. latte:r is dedared legally bankrupt 'rhfs is according to
the aforesaid b.adtt/1, ita. whI~ the Proph~t (f'BUH) says:

"Ifa man finds his ve:1y things Wit/, a bankrupt, tllen he /ms more right
to take them back tha,, an.yonr else."
The third 1cuJing on the i nterdicted person is that the 9"edltors are
not to ask him to pay his ikbts ~fter being interdicted until the
interdiction ends, During the period ofinterdktlon, ifone sells a piece
of h1erchandise for tlbe interdicted or lends him an amow1t of money.
une i~ to,isk him to pay only ~Iler the interdiction bas ended.

Chapccr 17: lnknlicrion

The fourth rnling is !;hat 1hose in authorii-y are 10 sell the irtterdictecl
person's property 11nd divide itS' price among the ereditors. to pay his
due debts, according to !he -ainow1t of debts be owes tu each. 1'his is
becaose it is for this purpose he has been lnterdicte.d. Thu5, it will be
procrastination and injustice to them if the payment of debts is delayed.
Those in authority are pennltted to let the bankrupt person keep what
~e Is in need of; his house. provisions and the like. As for the deferred
debt, it does not become du~ when one becomes l'>ank-r,spt. Uesjdes,
the d.eferred dept is not to be part of the due ones, since the bankrupt
person has the right to delay the payment of a defer-r ed debt Until it
becomes due; yet, he is still obilged to pay it. Moreover, this right t'o
deh1y the payment of a deferred debt is not lo be violated, qnilke his
other rights to dispose of his remaining properly;
After diyidi.ng the property of the bankrupt person to &etl'le his due
debts, interdiction ends without a,leg'<ll verdict from those in authority
if the property covers aif his debts. since ihere is no more reason for it
and debts arc settled Tn case the sold property of ttie bankrupt person
does not cover all his debts, interdiction does not end except with a
l'egal -verdict from those in authorlty, who have int.erdicted him and
thus-they alone can legally end this interdiction.

The ·Second Type of Interdiction
This type has been established in the Shari' alt (Islamic Law) for the benefit
of the interdicted person for safeguarding his property: 'fhis is because Islam is
the religion of mercy and it does not leave a useful Olatter but urges people to
do it. nor does it leave a harmful matter but warns against it. Among the things
that show 1he leniency of Islam is giving the pe.rsoo who is legally competent
the eight to dispose of his property and oarry on commercial transaction6,
,vithin the allowable l'imil&, to gain a legal profit, since this will benet1t both
the imlivid1111I and the sociery. However, if a person js unfit to gain profits and
to carry on trade due to being a minor, weak-minded or insane, Islam denies
him the right of disposing of his own property, and appoints a g11ard!an to
protect, keep safe and increase hls property. This is to continue until there is
no legal impediment; only at that time, he is given back his property in fulL
Goncerning this, All~h. Exalted be He, says:
'1-\t,d do not give the wellk-111111ded yo1.tr property, wl,ich Allah has
made a lneansofsusw,anccforyou. ,.~ (Q11r1n; An-Nisif: 5)

(Qur'an~An-Nist: 6)

T-hese two noble ve~se;; referto the interdiction decreed for the benefit
of the person ( who is \lnable to dispose ofhis property) since this protects
h.ls lotetests.
This type of interdiction1 is imposed on one'.s property and liability. Thus,
the interdicted person does not have the right to dispose of his own property
thro~h selling, donating or other kinds of transactions. Therefol'e, it ·;s legally
invalid for him 'lo be r.esponsible for paying a debt. guarantee, sponsorship or
the like, lest he should caU6e·a loi.s to other peopies properties,

Jt is fnvalid for gne to be involved with a weak-mii,ded person inJ1riancial
affairs, such-as buying, lending \money or objects) or depositing. In ~e one
does, one is allowed to tak;, back one's property if it 'is still int~ct. [f SlJ.Ch a
propern, .is damaged intentionally or unintentionally. 1t will deserve no
compensation since Lhtwealc-minded person is notle,gallyrequiredto be liable
for soch dealings. r11 such a ,:ase, tme Is considered neglectful as one willingly
and voluntarily has concluded transaction wiih an interdicted person. Jf the
interdicted person (such as a minor or a weak-mi11ded person) causes harm
to a person or a property, h(? is to bear the consequences and b'e liable to any
consequent fines, since1he wronged party has not been neglectful nor has he
given the interdicted person the perm1ssion. Besides, the juristic rule states
that in responsibility for damage, hofh !hose with legal capacity and those
without are equal before the la:w. With regard to this, the great scholar JbnulQayyim said:
"The ,:hiJd. the insa11e mid ihe sleeping person are ta compensate far
wha( they spoil of properties. This is one of the commonly agreed
(tpan ntlings without •11hich peep/e's i11terests would not be fulfilled,
If those Wftho11t legal Clfl/)Q.Cily were not to compensate for what t/rey
dalnage, people w<1uld damage each other's properties pretending
that it ls .accidentql/y awf u11inter,tio11ally done." 1•

Interdicting the Minor E1nds ln 'Two Cases:
The first cast is reachi~g puberty, which ls known by some signs:

The first s.ig!l for the m,ale is discharging semen in wakefulness or during
~leep; Allah, Exalted be He, say:s:

Chap«< 17: l[(ccrdicclon

'Fl

•~11d whe11 the childrett anw,ig you reach puberty, /erthem ask
pennllSion [at all times} ..."
(Qur'an:An-Nur: 59)
Puberty applles 111 a male person after the flrst wet dream.
Thr second sign is the growth of the pubic hair.
The third sign is becoming fifken years old. What proves this is what
• Abdullah lbn · umar (may Allah be pleased with hitn) said:

"The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) called me to present myself rn front
of him on tire Day of(thc Battle of) Ub.ud while I was fourteen years of
age at that time, and he did 110/ allow me (to join the battle). Then he.
called me in front of /1im on the Day of(tlie Battle) of tl1e AI-Khandaq
(the Trench) when I wa.s f,jicetr years old, and he allowed me (to jam
the battle),"
(Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)"
This fladith proves chat a child reaches puberty when he is fifteen
years old, In another narration, • Abdullah Ibn ' Umar explained
the reason behind being forbidden from joining lhe Battle ofUh_JJd
$aylng;

''.,. He (the Prop/11rt) saw that I Jwd r,ot reached the age of ttmtunty (to
be able to fight).•"
The fourth sign concerns the youi1g girl, for ~he is known 10 have reached
puberty when she has her fir!it rpenstrual period, for the Prophet
(PBUH) said:

j\//ah does not accept the prayer ofa woman who has reached.puberty
unless she wears a veil."
(Related by At-Tirmidhi who deemed ita b.asan (good) 71.adith)'~

The second case is sound judgment along with reachiqg puberty,
wh(cb means displaying competence in handling one's property; for Allah,
Exalted be He, says:

'iiml rest the orphans [in their abilities] until' il,ey reach
mllrrillgellble llge. Thim ifyou perceive in them sound judgment, release their property to them. .."
(Qur'~; An-NisA': 6)

98

l TRADE 1' RANSACTJONS

Sound judgment is re~ognized by te~ting a person's abiUHes concerning
financial dealings (handling property). To prove a person's sound jud'gment,
he is to be allowed to coadude busines~ deals repeatedly, and if he Lq not
excessively cheated, and he dloes not spend his money 011 prohibited or useless
matteri;, he thus shows soun,d judgment.
lnterdicting ;in insane 1:.ersun of his lceg.11 capacity ends in t,wo cases;

the first is regn'ining sanity and the serond Is heing of sound Jiidgli1ent, as
previously stipulated with ,regard to the minor. Interdiction of the weak-

minded person ends when h,e comes to his senses nnd becomes rcasonnble- in
financial trnnsactioas. The guardianship of the financial affairs of any of such
three kinds of persons (the child, the insane pernon and tl\e weak-minded
person) is c'1-tried out du1ing; their interdiction by such a person's father if he is
just and ofsound judgment. This Is becausea father is the nearest one to show
mercy towards his-cha1·ge. After the for her comes the 6Jie stated in the fulhers
will as the guardian, for this guardian will be taking the fatl1er's plaGe, act1ng
as if he is the father's representative during his lifetime.
The guatdiart ought to ,deal with bis ward's property in the ward's best
fin,tncfol interest. Allah, Exalted be He. says:

'~11d do not appl'Oa(:h the orphan's property e.=pt in a way tkal
is best {i.e. i11te11di111r improve1111mtJ ...n
(Qur'an: Al.An ·am: 152)
This l'neans that the guardian must 001 manage or administer tbe property
of the orphan except In a way that bend1ts the orphan and makes his pmp~rry
legally increase. Though this noble verse refers only to the property of tl\e
orphan, it refers. by analogkal deduction, to the property of bo~h the weak·
mi11ded and the insane. Mo,teover, the guardfan as well, must preserve and
look afler tJte prc;,perty Qf th,! orphao orthe- II Ke and never expose it to risk or
devour it unjustly, for Allal1, Exalted he He. ~ays:
"111,teeil, those w/10 rfe1•on,r 11,e property 11/ orpl,ans u11j11stly are

(Qur'ftn: An-Nisg:, 10)

Allah, Exalted be He, 11dviscd the guardians ,1bout orphans to consider the
foci that their own children could be under l'he guardiansbip of other people
at any tin1e in the future; thus, since they like that their children be tre:ited
ldn\Uy (when they are ward,,), fhey must lre-~t t•ther people's children in the
san1e manner. In this- regard, Allnh, Exalted be He, says:

Chapter 17: fo ccrdlctiun

''.;\nd let" those [e;,cecutors ,md guardlar,s] fear [injustice]
as if they {thenuelves:/ had left we,,k offspring be1iind lmd

appropriaujustu:e."
(Qur'an: ,:\n-Nisa': 9)
Since the,✓!irds are unable either to preserve their property or to conclude
business deals in a way that would increase property, Allah has appointed
guardians over·them to take care of their financial transactions on \bell' belia!J
and to act to thtiir best f, aanci~ll advantage. Ali ah has given those gu.irdialls
commands to abide by; He ha;: forbidden the guardian~ ,to give th~ minors
the.ir (the minors') property lest they should waste or spoil it.
On the o ther h.and, Nfoh, ll.xalted be He, says:
"A1ul do 11ot give tile w,eak-miruled your property, whu:h Allah
has made a means ofsusrena11cefor yo11 .. .''
(Qur'an: An-Nis~'; 5)

Al-Batii Ibn K<1thtr (may Allah have metcy on him) said:
''Al/ali, Glor!fw.d and Exalted be T-1(. forbids thni the weak-minded

weak-mi11dcd oftheir legal capac'ity has been i11trod11c:ed.'·' "
Just as Allah, Exalted be !:le, has forbidden allowing the minors to handle
their own property and has ordained that upright and sngacious guardians
take cafe of 1t instead, He wa~ ns those guardians against dealing with tbat
property ei;,cept in a way that legally improves Lt and makes it grow. Allah,

( ur1der his guardia11shiJJ) ltaste1ted to separate his food and drink
ji·om the orphan's. Theret1po11, the orphan~ food ~sed to be kept
until it was eaten (by the orphan) or got spoiled. This was difficult
for them so they me11tlimed tliis to the Messenger ofAllah (PBUH).
Thus, Allah, Exldted be He, revealed the verse, '. .. And they ask you

Baqarah: 220) 'I'hereupon, tl,ey (tire Companions) mixed their-food

111 addition, among the d.eeds thro1igJ1 w'hich one could deal kindly and
fairly in ihe orphan's propercy is employing it in trade to gain profiis anil !Dake
it increase. Thus, lhe guardian is enritled to trade in the orphan's pro,ierty or
give it to another person shilring the profit aod the loss, for •'Risbah (may
Allah be pleased with her) usi!d rhe money of Muhammad fbn Abo Bili (may

'Trade in the property "f orplrn11s; otherwise, it will be co11sutned
by means of (payiligfrom it for) Zakali." 16
In addition, the guardian is entitled to spend '(reasonably) from the
orphan's property to cover th.e: latter'.s expenses. lh this regar.d, Shaykhut-lslllm
lbn Taymiyali (may Allah have merc:y on himi said:

"It is de.sirab1e to ho11or ithe orphan, make him glac/ 411d protect him

ji·om being humiliated; j~nce protecti11g a11d looking after him is for

The guardian or the.orph~in i.s also entitled to buy the sacrificial animal on
the Feast ofSacrifice ( 'ldul-Adbti) from the orph.an's property ifhe is wealthy,
since this is a day of happin,ess and joy. The guardian ls entitled as well to
spend on the education of the orphan from the latter's property, since this
benefits the orphan.
In case the guarruan is poo i;.'he is entitlea lo take ti-c,,rn the orphan's property

"'. ..and whoever is poor - let him take a,:cordb,g to what 1$

'Chis verse meanR 1ha1 when the guardian needs money,.he. is petmitted
to take from the orphan's property according to what is acceptable. ln this
toncern, Imam l bn Kathir said:
"This verse was revealed concerning the guardian of the orplw11;.
who maintains and manages tl!e latter's property and lakes thereof,
in ca.,·e he needs. A$ for tire ver:5e, '...And wl1oever, [wl1m acting as
guardian], is self-s•!fficimtshoidd refrain [from taking afeeJ; and
whoever Is poor - ie.t him take according to what is acceptable..:
(Qur'am An-Nisa'•: 6), 'A'ishal, said, 'Ir was· revealed regarding

the case of.the orphan~ guardia,i; lie is permitted to take from the
orpltari'$ property a fee e'.fuivalerit to m,111agi11g a11d protecting his
(the orphan's) property.' • '
Faqihs maintain that the guardian over the orphan rnay take the least of
either his due fee (for managing the orphan's property) or the Stirn that meets
his l'\eeds. lt is narrated that a man came to the Prophet (l'BUH) ana said:
Kj have a11 orphan who has n property but•1 have 11olhi11g. Mayr

spend from his property?~ The Prophet (PBUHJ replieci, ''Use tf1e
property ofyoclr orphan without spending it lavis/Jly.""
Thus, it is impermissibie fu~ the guardian to spend from the orphan's
property more than the limit Allah has made allowable. Allah warns thosa
using 1he orphari's propeny favisl'tlywilh the severest threat revealing:
'~ ..And do not consume irexcessfve/y 1md q11ickly, {antldpating]
(Qur'air: An-Nlsa': 6)
that tl,ey will graw up ..."

Allah, Exalted be He, also says:
•~-And do not consume their properties illh) :your own. Indeed,

that is ever·agreatsin."

(Qur'an: An-Nisa'; 2)

In lhisvetse.Alluh means tbaLit is a great sin lo consume the orphans' properties
into those of their guardians, thus Muslims must,be keen on abiding by Alla:hs order
and avoiding that .great sin. Purthermore, Ailah, Exalted be He, says:
"J,,deed, those who devour the property of orp11ans unjustly arc
only consuming inu, their bellies fire. A nd tliey will be b11rned In

CHAPTER

Conciliation
Conciliation is an agreement on the basis of which settlement is reached
between two disputing parties. In fact, conciliation is of the greatest useful
contracts. Therefore, it is advisable to He a lit.tie, if necessary, when making
settlement between two parties in a disagreement
Conciliation is legalized according to the Qur'an, the Sunnah (Prophetic
Tradition) and consensus. There are numerous verses which prove Conciliation;
Allah, Exalted be He, says,
". . .and settlement is best..."
(Qur'an: An-Nisl\': 128)
He also says:

'~nd iftwo factions among the believers should fight, then make
settlement between the two. But if 011e of them oppresses tl1e
other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to
the ordinance of Alla/1. And if it returns, then make settlement
between them in justice and act justly. Indeed, Allah loves those
(Qur'an: Al-Hujurat: 9)
who act justly!'

1TRADE TRANSACTION~

106
Moreover, Alfa!\. Exalred be He., says:

"No good is there ill much of their private conversaJio1i,
except far those wh,~ llfljoln clt11rity or that which is rlgl1i or
conciliation between people. Aud whoever does that seelcing
means of the approw1I of Allah - th,m We are going to give
/1imagreatrewatd.~'
(Qur'ln: An-Nisa: 114)
He also says:

••...So fear Allah 1111d amend that which i.t.betllleetr yo11 ...~·
(Qur'an: Al-Anf~: I)
Besides, the Prophet (PBUH) Sllid in a had/th regarded asiab.111 (authentic)
by At-Tirmidhi:

''Comriliation is perrr.tissible among Muslims except the l'uhciliation that makes •.vllat is iawful prohibited or makes what
is prohibited lawful."'
In addition, the Prophet ('. PBUH) used·to make settlement beiweeQ people
who were in disagreement'.
The permissible conciliation here is the one Which is justly arranged, as
ordained by Allah and !:{is Messenger (PBUH). a11d in which one seeks Allah's
piea~ure and then that of those in dispute.
The one who undertakes conciliation between people ought to be wellinformed of the circumstan,ces of the disagreement, aware of what he ought
to do in th.at regard and intending justice whe!l arranging a settlement. In
fact, ,the degree of the Muslim who makes peace among Muslims is better
than that of the Muslim wh1, fasts and performs prayer continuously. Yet, if
peacemaking is done witho'l.it justke, it will tum into oppression and doing
wrong to the right of the oppressed paity; such as mak.ing peace between
a powerful unjust person and a weak helpless wronged one in a way that
pleases the powerful one enabling bim to violate and deny the right of the
weak one.
Besides, peacemaking Js,arranged only with regard lo the rights of people,
when the wronged one could g;v~ it up or be compensated for It. Howeve.r,
as for the eights of Allah, Exalted be Re, such as the prescribed punishments
and the Zqkah, !here Is no way whatsoever to handle ii with conciliation., for
conciliati.o o with Allah in these cases can be reached by performing these very
acts of won;hip (i.e. prescribed punishment's and Zaktil, etc.)

Chapcc.r 18; ConcUiacion

Con~iliation is of Five. Types
The First Type: Concflia1io11 between Muslims and. aon-Musltmf who
show hostility to Ml1Slims
The Second Type: Conciliation between the Muslim commllnily and
rebellious Muslims
The Third Type: ConcillatioO' between the hushand and his wife for·fear
of dissension
1'he Fourth Type: Concilialion between rwo parties regarding a matter
other than finanda1 affairn
•
The Fifth Type~ Conciliation between two parties disputing over
vroperly, which w!II be demonstrated here. This type is dfvided info
two other types:

1· Conciliation of acknowledgment: Which is of two k111ds:
The first kind is to arrange concillation between the two p,mies in order
to return the very type of the object of disagreement.
The second kind is to anange conciliation for re1uri1ing11 thing otberthan
tbe object of disagreement.
The 'first kind of conciliation of acknowledgment is conciliation 10
re.tum the very type of the object of disagreement is in cases when
one, for eX11mple, acknowledges owing another person a debr or
acknowledge.sowing him a sum of money, which is in ones possession.
Both parties then agree to conciliate when the indebted patry pays
part of the debt and the credHor, on his side, relinquishes th~ rest
thereof. Also, this kind of conciliation may happen when the creditor
cedes to the debtor an amount 0£ the owed object and rakes the rest
thereof. This type of coi1c1lintion is valid unless the acknowledgment
is stipulated. For eicample, the debtor may say that he acknowl~((ges
owing money to the creditor provided !hat the latter gives him so ~lid
su or compen5ales him with so ;ind so, or the cred,tor may release the
debtor from the debt stipulating that the debtor gives him a certain
thi11g. Arranging conciliation in this manner is invalid, for the creditor
bas the right to ask for all his rights (all that which the debtor owes
him). For rendering this type of conciliation vnlicl the debtor is not
to refuse to give the creditor what ne owes him in case there i5 no
conciliation, for this would he ah ac.t of con~um,ing people's wealth

108

l lllADE T'RANSACf!ONS

unjustly, wl\ich is forbidden by Allah. Also, the debtor is to pay what

he owes unconditionally (whether there is conciliation or not) .. 1n
addttion, for vaiidating thls type of IX)nciliatfon, the creditor onust be
of those whose donation is valid; if not, this conciliation Wouldbetheri
invalid. An example for this is lhe donation given by a guardian of an
orphan or .an insane person, since the guardian woult\ be donating
something that do~ not belong to him.

ln a few words, it is' pertnissi\)le to arrange concili~tion between two
disputing parties to return the established object of conciliation by
part of the s~me type provided that the debtor does not refuse 10 give
back his debt in case there is no conciliation. Be.o;ides, the creditor must
be of those whose donation is valid. It is permissible as well to effect
conciliation in case the afores<lid requirements are fulfilled, since this
would be a,d'onation and one is not to be prevented fro on reliJJquishing
part of wbathe lends or- from having it back in full. This is because the
Prophet (PBUH) asked the creditors of J~bir Ibn 'Abd'ullah to make
some reduction il'I his debts'.
The second kind of conciliation of acknowledgment is conciliation to
substitute an object of a different type for the object ofdisagr~ement.
This tiappe11s 1n cases when someone acknowledges that !le owes
another person a debt or an object, and both agree thal the creditor
is to ralcc an ol>ject as compensation for a different one. Thus, if
conciliation is to be arranged to return money for money, then this
will be considered an exchange whoseTulings are to be applied in this
transaction. !f concil1ation is to be arrange<l to give back an object in
return for money,.this will be considered selling whose mlings are to
be applied in this transaction. Moreover, if conciliation is agreed upon
for establishing a benefit, as in the case when the creditor hires a place
belonging to the debtor, 1t will be a kind of renting whose rulings ;u:e
to be applied, If conciliation is arranged to give back money fo relurn
for the disputed object, it will be considered selling,
2- Conciliation of Denial
lt refers to a person claiming that ,1nother person owes him an object or a
debt; Upon that drum, the oilier person doe,; nol deny the claim out is ignorant of
the cfulmed' objecL The respondent then o5ks O,e claimer lo relinquish hi& claim
nhd to arrange conciliation in wl\Jch the claimer will obtain a sum .of money,
whether paid on i!1e spot pr def~rred. Conciliation in this case is valid according
to the majority of the people of knowl edge, for the Prophet (PBUH) said;

Chapce, 18: Condlfat(on

102

"Conciliation is permisslb,le,among Muslims ex1;ept the conciliation that makes what is lawful pl'Ohibited or makes what is
prohibited Iawfttl."
(Related by Abu Dawiid andl At-Tirmidhi, and the latter said, ffTbis
is a b.asan (good), ~a!l1l1 (1111,thentic) badtth." AI-H~im regards Ihis

b.adith as ~a!lil1)'
'Urnar Ibnul-Khattab sent this /J.aditli On a letter} as a proof qf eff~cting
rnndliation) to Abo Musa'. Thus, this li.adf1h can be safely applied as a _proof
in this rtgard because of the afon,said considerations.
The ben~fit of this tf.pe of c:onciliation which tlie respondent gains is
avoiding the legal proceedings a.nd taking an oath gefore the judge. A.'! for
the claimer, h spares him the tro1.1.ble of establishing evidence a;nd helps him
obtain what he claims to be his as soon as possible.
In conciliation of denial, the claimer ls regarded as selling the claimed
object since he believes that wh;at he takes is compensation foe his money
(the claimed o'bject), thereby he ought to abi~e by what he believes. rt is as
if the respondent had bought th,~ claimed object from the claimer, t!lus the.
rulings on selling apply to this transaction. Among these rulings is the right to
return the sold item for being faul.ty and the right of preemption, if the rlgh1 of
preemption can be applied therei111.
As for the respondent, heis considered, after effecting con~iliation with tbe
claimer, acquitted from the claim. He has paid money (for the claimed object)
to avoid taking an oath, remove harm thaf may afflict him, end the dispute,
and protect himself against being indulged in disputes. Besides, honorable
peop)e reject being invoh•ed in such maUers and would rather pay money co
avoid such .claims. lf ,the claimer (who becomes a buyer in this ca.se) find's a
defect in the object (given to him in compensation for the disputed one), he
does not have the rig'.ht to return ilt, and it C'ilnnot be tal<en by preemption froll!
the respondent, as he does not co:nsider it a real •compensation for anything,

Conciliat1on of denial become:s invalid in case either party lies to Ihe other.
The claimer may lie claiming his right to an object which he knows well that
ii does not belong to him. Likewise, the respondent IJ\ay deny whatever claim
is advanced by the claimer though he kuows that he i6 lying and he owes the
claimer such a thlqg, ConciliatiCln thus becomes nu U for the· one who lies
conceaii!lg the truth, $ince he knciws the truf)i, 311d is able to give the right to
its owner, and does not bell'eve that be fs in the right. Thus, whatever he takes

JJO

l TRAD!!1 1RANSACTION~

or obtilins in this ~ase by means of the conciliation is prohibtted, for he takes ,i t
unjustfy and wrongfully and not in compensations for something he deserves.
Allah, Exalted be He, says hi this concern:
':A11,t do not cons11n1e 011;, a11other's wealth unjustly, ,,"

(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 188)
This conciltut[on appears to be valid since people do not know the hidden
truth, yel, Allah, from Whom nothing is bidden in the earth nor!n the heaven1
invalidates it. Therefore, Miuslims must be keen on avoiding such prohibited
octions lllld should keep aw,ay from obtaining money fraudulently.
Oneof the rnlings on conciliation ofdeni.al is that coociliation is valid ifa tl\ird
party takes the place of the denying party (the respondent) in the conciliation
without his permission. Thiis is because the thtrd party intends to acquit the
denying party in order to avioid any dispute "1th the claimer. Ir is as if the third
party had paid the debts of the denying puty on his behalf. Yet, !he third Pilt\')' is
not to ask the denying party to pay what he has granted, sil!ce he does. not have
the right to do so; the third party in this case is considered a do11ator.
Another ruling is that conciliation i~ vnlid when being arranged to end a
disagreement over an unknmvn object whether both parties owe one another
or one of them owes the other. That is., conciliation is applicable ifit is difficult
to know this objt>ct such ai; the cases of unsettled account from a long time
ago and neither of the parties knows what he owes the other. Once, two men
disputed over their heritage which was a long time ago. The Prophet (PBUH)
said to both of them;
"Draw lots, seek the truth, a11d then let· everyone ofyou qbsolve /,is
companion (from any right on Iris side)."
(Related by Ahn Dawiid and other compilers o(J:ladtlh)°

In this case, since one of the two parties absolves the other from his right
on his iiability, conciliation becomes valid. In spite of the fact that the dispute.
is over an unknown O~jeCI~ it is valid here for necessity, i'n order to avoid
wasting tnoney or being burdened by rights of others, The Prophetic order,
in the above-mentioned b.a,dlt/r of absolving one another froro al.ly liabilitiOSl
signifies that one should be concerned with being -absolved frorn people's
right,; in order t o free one's liability. It also 5ignrfies how grea\ and in,iolabla
the rights of people are.
Another ruling on conciliation is tl'rnt ii is valid lri CISI/S of qi;,14, (Jegal
r~lributil)n) through the pa.yment of di)'all ' as a substitute according 1<1 the

amount of diya/1 ~tatetl in the Shari· a/1 (Islamic Law), or less or more dependent
on the agreemeor ofboth parties. S iace the object of dispute is not a property that
can be compensated for, .-s it is a human sou~ so there cannot be compensation
based on human esh·mation in this case. Rather, the blood money is to be paid
according to the Shari 'a/i.

It is not valid to conciliate something related to the prescribed punishments
(punishments enshrined in the Q:uran and the Swma1,), since Allah, Exalted
be He, has prescribed these p1mlshments for deterrence. Beside~, these
punishments are the right of Allah, Exalted be 'He, and among the rights of
the commu11ity. Thereby, conciliatting something related to these punishments
renders them invalid, denies the community of their b ei1efits and opens the
way for those intending corruptlo,n.

Neighborhood and Roadways
faqlhs' have dealt with the issue of neighborhood and roadways and the
rulings related thereof because of !he great importance this issue has. Problems
may arise between neighbors an.d ought to be immediately solved lest they
should cause dispute and hostility.
Muslims ought to solve these problems by arranging conciliation between
neighbors who are in disagreement in a way that achieves justice and benefit. If
$01llCOne makes conciliation, for example, to aUo,v water to pass to him through the
land of the neighbor or over his ho,usetop (by means of a water pipe, for example),
in teturn for compensation, this c-onciliation is valid since it is necessary. If this
compensation iS' to be paid in retum for a benefit or for making use of the land or
the housetop while they still belorng to their owner, this is considered renting. lf
one wishes to possess the part of his neighbor's housetop or land through which
water passes, then thi.5 is consideri?d selling. If a neighbor is in need of a passage
through a property of the neighbor in return for a compensation or through
conciliation, this will be permisslb.le since it is necessary.

I TRADE TRANSACTTONS

114

The owner of the land or tbe housetop should not take advantage of
his neighbor's need, by asking for a hig,h compensation or refusing to let
him make use of that passageway; thus, the owner causes hardship to his
neighbor and prevents him from fulfilling his needs, Moreover, if a branch
of one's tree (in his land orJhis house) exteDdstoreach the land or the house
of the person next to him, it becomes obligatory on the owner to remove tt,
either by cutting orbendin,g it toward a:nolher direction to pull ii away from
the land or house of the m:ighbor. If the owner of the br.anch refuses to do
one of the aforesaid ac1ion,s, the landowner or the house owner ,s entitled
to remove the hnrm caused by that brnm;h with one of these actions, since
this branch i.s thus a viola,tion which is to be removed by ao nction that
causes the least damage. If both agree by means of conciltation to leave
the brnnch in its place, th,L, will be permissible, whether in return for a
compensation, accordia.g t'o the soundest view of scholars In this regnrd, or
on the basis of sharing lhe frt1it of1he branch, The same ruling on a branch
applies to the case when a wooden column eldend.~ nnd reaches the land or
house of one's neighbor.
lt is impermissible to h1ave in one's property thal which may cause harrn
to ones neighborts), such as having a bathroom, a kitchen, a bakery or a
cafe wbose bar01s mny extend to reach one's neighbor(s) or having a factory
whose nois<o an_d working of machinery could djsturb one's neighbor{s).
Even havlng 11 window overlooking the house of one's neighbor m~y c,mse
harm to him.
!vloreove,r, if there is a j,oiot wall between two persons, ii is pn1hihited to
open a window through it wtthout the neighbor's permission. Furthermore,
it is impermissible to put or ftx wooden peg& in the joint wall or in thar of
the neighbor, except when neGe.s.sary, a11d when the wall could bear those
w(loden pegs and the roof.:ai:inol stand without them. This 1s according to a
marfii ' (traceable) b.adith narraled by Ab6 Hurayrah., in which the Prophet
(PBUH) says:

"No one should prevc,111 his neighbor from fl~ing ,a wooden peg in
his wall." Ab,) Huraymll t/zen said (to his Companions), 'Why do
I foid yo11 averse to iti' By Al/al,, 1 certainly will narrate it to you.'"

lRelated by AI-Bukhruti and Muslim) '
This l!.adith proves that ii is impermissible to prevent one's 11eigl1bor from
frxing wooden pegs in one's wall. Jf one refuses, those ill authorl\y are to force
him t<l accept, since it is 11 permanent right of one's nfi_gbbor.

Chapter 1.9: Neighborhood and Roadway•

\Nhat1s r]lenlioned above are some of the rulings on neighborhood. As for
the niiings with respect lo roadways, they are as follows:
• ltis impermissibl.e to annoy people on the roadways; one should rnther
clear a passage for people and 1-cmove harmfu l things from the road,
since lliese deeds are parts of faith as the Pr9p~e1 /PBUH) stated in
his h.a4iths.
• ft ls impermissible as well for a persou to build in his land what m:i,y
cause trouble to the passage of vehicles, pc'Ople or animals, sue!) • ~
building a roof \ to be shaded by in the road) which prevents \he
passage ofpeople riding vehicles or animals. or what they carry.
• It is impermissible also to specify a parking place on the road (or lhe
street) for one's riding arum al or one's vehicle as long as this may make
the road narrow or resuit in accidents.

• Shnykb,11-Jslam lbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on bim) said:
"If is Fmpermis.sible lo hm•e any tiling protruding from ones building
irt/o lhe roC1d.. [tis cve11forbidden to pl11Ste ro11e's wall (that is nex t to the
stie//t or tl1e road) except when leaving a space (equal to the thickness uf
plaste.ring) to the fnsTde of one$ house and plastering the wall as wide as
ot1e hns left ofspace.. .''

• One is also prohibited to do certain things on the road (or on the street),
such as plantirtg, building, digging, pu tting firewood, slaughtering,
throwing garbage and ~shes or the like, which may cause harm to
the pns.sers-by. Municipality officials are to prevent such actions and
inllict a deterr,ing punishment upoo whoever act~ contrarily, for
many people do not take this metier seriously. Some of them occupy
lhe roads to serve lherr own irtterests; they use the road for parking
their vehicles, putting their construction materfals such as bricks,
iron or cement, digging the roads. and doing many other violating
actions. Others throw harmful things, such as food wastes, rubbish
and impure objeclij in ma·rketplaces without any concern for harming
other Musl ims. All of these actions arc p,-ohibited by Allah and His
Messenger (PBU HJ; Allah.Exalted be He, says:

Preemption
Preemption is authenticaUy stated in the Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition)
and Allah, Exalted be He, bas ordained ii for blocking evil means related to
partnership.
The great Imam Ibnul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

"Preemption is one of the merits of Shari' ah (Islamic law) which
proves its justice and ability tofu/fill people~ interests and needs. The
wisdom behind legislating preemption is the necessity to prevent any
harm caused to people as far as possible. Since partnership, in most
cases, results in harm (dispute), such harm ca11 be removed either by
dividing the property or by preemption. When a partner wishes t'O
sell his share taking recompense (its due price), the other co-owner is
legally more entitled to buy it than any other strange party. Therefore,
the buyer prevents the harm caused to him fmm partnership; and the
seller is paid his due right· of the price and hence he is not harmed.
Preemption also protects the buyer against the harm caused by sharing

the property wit/I a s/1',ai,ge party, Thus; preemptiort is characterized
withgrecitjustice and;;; one oflh~ bestn,li11gs which /Ire In co,iformlt)'
with sourtd mi11ds, 1mtttral dispositions and interests ofpeople."'

Thus, it ~omes clear that trying by fraudulent means to im<alidate the right
to preempt contradicts the purpose for which preemption has been legislated.
At the 'Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance (AI-Jdhiliyyah), the right of
preemption had been cominon. So, if one wanted to sell onis house or garden,
the neighbor or the co-owmer wo11ld dem,and the i'ight of preemption to buy

I.be sold shnre, for such peo,ple more entitled to buy it.
.According co the Jaqif.rs, preemption men11s that the partner is more
entitled fo tilke his couateqpart's share sold to another person (a third party)
for recompense which is the·same price agreed upoo by th~ third party and the
other partner. Thus, the buyer has to sell the share he bought to the preemptor
against the price upon whkh both tthe buyer and the seller) agreed. This is
a~cording to what Imam A,hmad a11d Al-Bukhari related on the authority of
Jabir (mayAllah be pleased with him) that:
"Tht Prophet (PBIJJf,I decided the validity ofpreempHon in every
joint tmr#vided property, but iftlte boundaries ate well. marked qnd
the ways and·streets a,re fixed, then there Is no preemption:''

This above-mentioned badtth proves. that the oo-owner has the ri.ght to
preempt, and 1hat preempt ion i's only applicable and valid in land und real
estates (immovable properties) but not in movable possessions, furniture,
animal~ and the like. The Prophet (PBUH) also said:
·~ .. It is not lr.11vfalf9r liim (the pQrhier} to sell that i,.ritil the other
partner gives /1/$ ,:onsm,t.'0

This hadfth pro,·es that if is impennisstbk for !he partner to sell his share
(to a person other than tifa counterpart} unless he informs his counterpart
about that sale.
In this r~gard, Ibnul-Qa,yyin! said:

Cbapccr 20: Preemption

11 'J

Ibnul-Qayyim maintains Ihat the partner has no right to preempt a sold
property as long as he has been aliktd permission bafore the sale and showed
no iniention for buying. In fact, this vie.w is only one of two views of scholars
on preemption. However, the majority of scholars are of the view that the
partner still has the right to preem,pl, and his being11sked permission does.not
nullify his right to preempL Allah, Exalted be He. knows best.
PreempJion i:s a -legal right tlmt must be observed, aria it is fmpermissible
to try deceitfully to make the other _partner lose ii, (or preemption has b~ n
ordained to save the partner f~orn any harm. Thus, ifsomeone uses deceitt'ul
ways and plays tricks 10 deprive his partner from this right, he wilJ harm sucli·
a partner and violate hi5 legal right. Imam Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on
him) in this concern says:
"ft i,s impennissible to use deceitful ways if• order to 11111/ify the right

ofpreemption or any other n;ght d11e lo a Muslim. This is because the
Prophet (PIJVH) said, 'Do mif commit what the f,nvs had committed
in order to make lawful whot Alla/1 has prohibited, through the
lowest tritks.' "' '
One of the tricks that the parh1er may do to nu\Hfy the right of preemption
is to pretend to have given his. sba(e to a third party as a gift, wl)ile he. h:11,
sold it for a price. Also, ffie partner may 11sk for a high price from the other
partner to make him unable to p:ay and tlius prevent~ him from pree.mpti11g.
Shaykhul-151am tbn Toymiyah said:

"Deceitful actio11s and triclcs pfa)1ed by the part11er to deny the
preemptor }lis right to preelll'pl, invalidate tire contrnc/ ofsale (witll
tire buyer), besides, whatever words are written 1fu nui cha1tge the
Jaco of tire co11tracts."'
Preemption, ln fact, is valid in joint land if undivided, and wbateve~ tr.ees
and blllldings there are parl of the: land. Moreover, if the land has bdeit divided
and there are still some joint utilities, such as a joint walkway or a joint source
of water or the like, the preemptor still has the right to preempt according to
the soundest view of scholars in .this regard, 1t is also a~cording !O the general
meaning ofthe /!adith in which the Prophet (PBUtl) says:

''. ..if the boundaries are well marked ur1d the >\'4YS arid streets are
fi.-.:ed, then there 1s 110 pre~mptltm."'

I T~DE TRANSACTIONS

Thls had/ti, signifies that preemption ,s valid and applicable in divisible
things ·whose boundaries are established and whose roads have not been
designated. In this concern, lbnu1-Qayyim says:

"T/ils Is tlu: soundest view as far as the preemption ofneighborhood is
conccmed. Tl is also tlie vic,v 111ai11taincd b,v the People of Basra and
S/1ayk/111l-lslt1111 Tbn Taymiya/1, a1td is tme of the two views reported
ribout the school of Imam Ahmad."
Furthermore, Sheikh To.qiyyud-Dln said:

"Preempl'ion of 11eighborhood is valid ir, ,ase of sharing one of the
r,igl1l$ ofowner.ship; su,lr <IS slrari11g in a utility of a real estate, a Joi11t
Waterway or a walkway or tl1e like. This is the view m<1intai11ed by
lt11iim Ahmad.''
The same view is also maintained' by Ibn •Aqtl, Abo Muhammad and
Olhers. In addition, Al-HAiritht•said:

"Preemplia11 of neighborhood is valid whm bringing about a bmefit
1111d pro.venting a harm, a11d the.re are m1merous l!acliths supporting
this Vie,~. Thu i.5 .because neighborhood does not 11ece$sitate
preemption except when 11eiglrbors share. the walkway or £he like.
Besides, preemption has bee,i ordai11ed for prevel'lling lwrm, which
occurs 111 mosr cases of i;,J-ownershlp, or sharing r11e same 11t1Tity sucfi
mu walkway, a watenvay or the like."
Preemption is valfd when someone claims it immediatclyafter h~vlng been
informed that his pa.rtner (or his ne1ghbor) has sold'his share (of a real estate)
to another party. ff tbe other pattner (preen1ptor) does not demand the right
of preemption, he will then lose il However, "if the preemptor does noc know
aboui !be sale, he stlll has the r1ght to preempt. even ifhe r.emain.s uninfon:ned
about it for years.. Tn fh is concern, Ibo Hubayrah says;

", .-.Muslim scl-10/ars tm-ift,r-ml)I agree t/Jal wl1err the preemptor is absent
(and thus w1i~1fonned abo1Jt the su)~), lie ts still entitled to demand
hi$ right ofpremrption lo b11y the sold s11are as soo11 as he ;:eh,rns."'

If there are several partner.;, then they are entitled to preempt according
to the shares each possesses of.the whole property,.since they enjoy. thcir-r tgbt
of preemption by virtut' of their ownership. If a partner gives up his l'ig/ll
to preempt, th,: other partner is entitled to buy the rest of I.he property or
reHnquish lt all, ~ince taking only part of the property will hami the buyei; and
harm is not to be removed PY causi11g harm.

Kinds of Partnership

Some light should be thrown on the issue of partnership and its rulings,
as partnership is obviously widespread nowadays. People still practice dealing
and trading with each other, and this is considered a means of cooperation,
with the purpose of attaining common interests through developing and
investing wealth and exchanging experiences.
Partnership in trade and the like is deemed permissible according to the
Book (the Qur'an) and the Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition). Allah, Exalted be
He, says:

•~ ,.And indeed, many associates oppress one another..."
(Qur'.\n: .S.i\d: 24)
Here, the word "associates" refers to partners. The noble verse proves the
permissibility of partnership and the prohibition of oppressing one another
as partners.

11:PARTNERSHIP

126

The proof of the, permissibility·of partnership ls also stated in the Surmah,
as the Prophet(PBUH) said:

~I/ah, Exalted be He, says, 'I am the third of the two partners (i.e.
Allah is with them, taking care of, keeping, supportfr,g, and sending
duwn blessing upon their trade) as long as one of them does not
cheat the other. Bttc when lie cl1eats him, I dep_ari from them (i,e, to
take blessing away from tlr~ir trade),' •'
The b.adith l!wolves the legality of partnership ·a nd C¥horts people
to mafntain it provided they do not chear one another. Th.is is because
partnership involves cooperation and assistance, and the J,>rophe t
(PBUH) said:

'''Allah assists the person sr /cmg llS Ire assists his (Muslim) brother.u'
The person has to choose tlie one whose wealth is lawfull)• obtalned in
order to set up a partnetship With him, In addition, he is to.keep away from-the
people whose wealth ts complerely or partially ill-gotten. It is permissible for a
Muslim to go into partnership with a disbeliever, provided that the disbeliever
is not to be given full authority to run the business alone, That is, partnership
is to be under the supervision of the Muslim pa-rtner so as not to ,let that
disbeliever deal in riba' or any kind of prohibited matters, so making use of
his Muslim par-tner's absence of supervision.
Partnership is divided into two sections: Partnership in properties and
partnership in contracts, Ju for the first, it implies sharmg the ownership
of a real estate, lactory, automobiles, etc However, the second section of
partnership involves sharing in running the business, such as sharing in
selling, purchasing, renting, ~tc, ll: can be by sharing in both capital and work,
or sharing in work without capital.

Partnership in Contracts Consists of Five Types
1- '111411 (Cooperativ<') .Partnership: Lt involves equal sharing in !;,oth
capital and work,
2- Mud4rt1b11h (Speculative) Partnership: It re(ers to partnership in
which one of the two pl!rties is a silent partner, who only provides
capital, while the other r,uns the business.
J- Reputable Partner Partnership: It refers to partnership io ·trade bas~d

on fheTeputatioo, not the capital, of the partners.

Chi1~w· l: Kind; of Partocrship

'127

4- Manual Partnership: It rnfers lo p~rtnersbip lr\ which the two partners
sbare·whatever they earn by their own work, not by their wen:lth.

5- Comprehensive Partnership: It includes all rhe 11Jo1-esaid types of
partnership; cooperative, reputable partner, IU!llJYal, and speculative
partnerships. ln this kinH of partnership, each partner authorizes the
other to freely handle ev1:ry aspect of the c;lpital and labor.
This is just a summary of the· types of partnership, and we shall deal witli
each in detaiJ below.

'lnan (Coopeirative) Partnership

It refers to the equfvalence b,etween the two partners, fa both capital and
labor; they equally participate in the business. The real meaning of such a
type of partnership is that two or more partners provide equal capital for
the business so that the total cap[tal is regarded as one unit. They may worl<
together to invest it or, perhaps,. one of them runs the business and so takes
more profit than the other(s).

'!nan (cooperative) partQe:rship is deemed permissible in accordance
with the consensus of scholars, as recorded by1bnul- Mundhir (may Allah

have mercy 011 him). Yet, scholars disagree only concerning some of its
conditions.
Every partner has the right to dispose of the capital of the partnership due
to his share and hls being com1J1 issioned by the other partner. This is because
the word "partnership" indicates. each partner's dealing on behalf of the other
without taking his permission.

130

O:PARTNERSHil'

Scbolars agree thnt it is permissible lo make the capitai of the partnership
either gold or silver, as people bave beeo in the habit of doing so since the time
of the Prophet{PBUH) up until now without any disapproval. However, they
disagree whether it is permissible ,)r not to make the capital of cooperotive
partnership consist of men:handise (instead of money, gold, or silver). Some
scholars maintain that it is in:ipermis:.iblc because the value of the merchandise
ofone partner may increase before selling, while that of U1e other may not, .ind
thus one partner shares the increase of the other's wealth. Others view rhn1 it
is permissible to provide merchandise as capital in cooperative partuership,
whicl1 is a sound opinlon. This is becaµse the basis of partnership is that both
of tlie two partners call dispose freely of all their fonds, and that they shnte
wh11tever they earn, and this applies to merchandise as well as money.
Ainong the conditions of the validity of cooperative pnrrnership is that the
profil of each partner should be previously specified (61JCh as having one,third
or ,me-fourth of the profit) a.ccording to his ; hares in the business. This is
because the partners share in the profits, and none of them,s},oulc! be favored
over the other except with their previous mutual agreement. Therefore, the
share in the profit ofeach partner has to be previously specified; otherwise, their
pa11ne_rship is nejther permissible nor valid. A~cordingly, it is impermissible
for each partner to stipulate that he will get his profit from a certain object (of
the capital), or th-at he will get it at a certain time, or that he will get the profit
collected on a certain trade journey. The reason 'for this is that the specified
object alone may or may not achieve profit, or that the trade may mak,.. only
the profit concerning the share of one person only. This undoubtedly may lead
to disputes among the partners, or may tnake the effort of one of them go in
vain, which is prohibited in our lenient Slwrf' r1h (Islamic L.iw), as it involves
deception .ind harm.

CHAPTER

Mudarabah (Speculative)
Partnership

Juristically, muqarabah (speculative) parlnership means giving a certain
amount of monei' 10 ochers in order 10 Icade with it in return for a share in the
profit. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"...And others traveling throughout the landseeking [something]
of the bounty ofAllah ..."
(Qur'~n: Al-Muzzammil: 20)

The verse involves seeking bounty through trade and striking of deals.
According 10 the consensus of scholars, speculative partnership is deemed
permissible. Moreover, this type of partnership was practiced during the lifetime
of the Prophel (PBUH) and he approved of it. That partnership system is
reported to have been practiced by 'Umar Ibnul-Khatrab, 'Uthmin lbn •Affan,
'Ali Ibn Abll Ialib, lbn Mas' lid and other compilers of Hadith, with whom none
of the Companions (may Allah be pleased wilh them all) has disagreed.

U:J>AR'fNERSHI!'

Wisdom requir,es r.lw pe1•missibility of spe~,,foti<m with wealth, ,...,. pt>ople
need it; wealth can only be developed or invested througl\ tr:1de and tr.u:5action.
With regard to this is.que, the great scholar Ibnul-Qayyim said:

':4 ,-pecul/'ltor is a trustee, o hired person, a represencaHve, and
partner. He is a trustee when Ire takes the other partner~ wealt/11111d

Ille validity of tht speculative partnership, tile entrusted speculator's
s/1,ire of the proj1t should be preyio11Sly specified, us it would be hi.s
dt1e acc(lrding to such a mt1h1ai agreement."
Jbnul-Mundhir said:

"Scho/,m; unanimously agreed that the worker (the errtrustei/ spet ,,ltllor) has tl,e right to stipulate a certain percentage of the profit from
1/,e beginnin& such as o,ie-third or half of the profit, or whatever
is agreed upon by the fwo partners. Still, if the ow11cr of Im money
.<peciftes a certain amoimt of the profit or the whole profit for the
worker (the entrusted ,ipec,.;/ator), Dr spec/fi.es nothing at a1i their
pm-t11e,.;hip becomes i1i:valid ."7
The share of the profit t hat the •entrusted speculator will got.depends on•
the mutual agreement betwi:en him and the investor \the owner). ThCJ'efore,
if the owner·asks the worker to trade with his money telling him that they will
share the prol'il together, then the profit is to be e-qually divided between them.
Moreover. if is permissible- for the owner to stipulate that he will get a certain
share of the profit, sueh as three-fourths or one-third of the profit. This is
because when the share of each is known, both of them will get bis due.share
of the profit. 1n other wor~. when the share of oAe of them is specified, the
other's share will be known accordingly.
If the two partners dispute regarding whose share of the proflr is 1he
specified one, il must be givE?n to the entrusted speculator, be it much ,oc little.
'This 1s because he is the oni~ who deserve.s ii due to his work and effort. ·1:'he
worker's share of the profit ;3fready varies depending on how much effort he
exerts; he may ger a small sh.are of the.Profit for an easy or simple work, or ger
a large share in case of hard work. ln addition, the estimation of the share of
profit specified for the en~:ted speculator depends on his skill. Consequently,
his share of the profit is lo be stipulated, unlike the owner who deserves his
share due to the wealth he owns and provides, not through condition,i.

Chapcor 3: Mlltfir11b,,I, (Specub1iv~) PHrmctshlp

B'il

If the specµ)ative partner6hip iis cancelled, the profit is ro be for the owner, as
the capital M Well as irs increase belongs to him. However, the entrusted speculator
is just tu get his wage, as the profil is to be according lo the stat~d condition, and
the condition fa abrog~ted as a res,ult of the abrogation of the speculotion.
It is p~issible lo set a certal I\ period for the speculative partnership, after
Which the part:ners11ip is to be terminaied. That is, the owner of tlie .wealth
may stipulate that he will agree iin a speculative partnership with the worker
for a year for example. A spec~1lative partnership ls also permis.~ib1e 16 be
based on a future c:ondition. To illustrate. it is permissible for the owner to
specify a celi'tain month for the entrusted speculator to start using the money
of the former for specul~tion, He m.ay a,!so ask the entrusted speculator to use
his money for speculation after rhe latter gets it from such and such a persou.
This is because .speculative part11ership is rermission of free disposal of the
money-given by the owner of thE: money to the entrusted speculator, so lr can
be dependent on a future condition.
On the other hand, it is impermissible for a1, entrusted spectil'a tor in a
speculative partnership to work :as a partner for another capital owner if that
will' negatively affect his first partner, unless the latter gives him permission.
For exaiupl~. the wealth oft-h e worker's new partner may be so much that it
takes all his time and thus negatively affects the i,nt~rests of his first partner:
Moreover, the wealth of the first p-artner may beso much that it take$ dll the rime
of the entrusted speculator, and thus if the latter gets into another speculative
_partnership, Me may ·be inattentj,1e of some of the first partner's. interests. Yer,
it i~ permissible for tl1e worker to speculate in the wealth of another ,partner
When the first partner gives him permission IO do so and when there will be
,no harm caused to the first partn.ers interests.
In this connection, ifthe worker speculates Ul the wealth ofa second partneF
Without the permission of the first, causu,g harm to the first partner's interest~.
the worker Is to take his share of the profit made through his second speculative
partnetship and add it to the profit of the first partnership. After that, the total
profit is to ·be divided between him a11d hi6 fir5t partner according to ihcit
previously stated conditlons. This, Is because the effort exerted by the worker in
his second specula.tive partnership should have been exerted in the first.
It 1s impel'Jllissible for the worker (entrusted speculator) to spend from
!he capital of the specu.lation, rneither for travel expeuses nor for anything
else, unless it is previously stipulated. This is becai.Jsetbe worker is supposed
to speculate in,his partner's weillth In return for part of the profit, so he is

U:PARTNERSHIP

not !!Unwed to spend from f.he main capital in petty expenses and thus take
more than his share. This is only permissible if .itis previously approved by
the owner of the money or l'nere is a conventional trade practice ,t hat enables
one to do so.

Tbe profit should not be distributed as long as the contract ofthe speculative
partnership is in effect, unl\!Ss both parties agree to divide it. This is becau,~e
fhe profit ls regarded as a means of protecting the capital; the profit is used
10 cover any accidental loss during spei;ula:tion. So, if it is -divided while the
partnership contract is in effect., it will not be possible to make UJ>' for any
accidental loss. ri, brief, the profit is a way of saving the capital, so the worker
does not have the right to ~laim any profit except after the capital spent is
completely regained.
Since the worker is a trustee, he has to fear All~h regarding what he is
entrusted with, and should be believed regarding any claim nbour loss or
damage of lhe property. He should also I.le believed concerning whatever he
daims he has purchased for himself not for the i pecuiation, or vice versa, ,as be
is entrusted with that from the beginning, And Allah knows best.

Reputable Pairtner, Manual, and
Comprehensive Partnerships
First: Reputable Partner Partnership
It is a trade partnership in which two or more partners provide no capital
but they are reputable enough to purchase trade goods for deferred payment.
The partners share whatever loss or profit in accordance with what they have
previously stipulated. This kind of partnership involves no capital. Rather,
the partners purchase and sell g:oods depending on their good reputation,
covenant, and people's trust in them, and share in the profit according to their
previous stated conditions; the Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Muslims must keep to the conditions they have made.•'
This type of partnership is simiilar to '/nan (cooperative) partn.ership. so it is
given the same rulings. Each of the two partners is considered a representative
commissioned by the other partner, as this type of partnership is based on
commission aod sponsorship.

11:PARTNERSl-CTP

136

The sha1-e ofeach partner, With regard t<l the ownership, is to be specified
according ro their mutual agreement. be it an equal. less, or more share. In
addition, each of them is to bear bis share of the loss in accordance with
what he owns in the partnership; if one owns half the company, one is lo
bear half the loss, and so on. Likewise, the share of the profit of each partner
depends on their previous stipulation. be it half, fourth, or third of the profit
This is because one nf them mo.y be more reputable and trw;tworthy among
merchants,than the other, or more.skillful in tcade than the other. Moxeover,
the effort or the kind of work done by one partner may differ from that done
by the other, so one of them may deserve to have a larger share than {hat of
the other. In such a case, they are to stick and refer to the conditions they
agreed upon ,

Jt ls worth mentioning that each partner in this type 0£ partnership has the
same right.s stated in '/nan (cooperative) partnership.

Second: Manual Partnership
Jt is a kind of partnetl:hip in whkh two or more partners share whatevt"r
they earn by their own work. It is so called because the partners use theit manual
power in wock.ing, as a meaos of eamlng money, and they share whatever profit
they get.
The legal proof of the permissibility of manunl partnership ,is the hadith in
which Ibn Mas ' lid (may Altah be pleased with him) said:

"l, 'Ammar. and Sa 'd became partners i11 what we would g~I (from
the booty) on the Day of(the Battle of)Badr. Sa 'd then brought two
prisoners, but f a11d 'Ammiir did not bring anything."
(Retared by Abu Dawi1d, An-Nas~'i. and other compilers of Haditlr)

1

Imam Ahmad commented:

"The Prophet (PBUH) made them siiare i11 the ownership of the two
prisoners. Hence, this fladith proves t/iu permissibility of manual
partnership."
A,; soon as partners get imo manual partnersbip, the works accepted by
one of them become obligatory to be accepted by the other(s). So, each of the
panners is demanded t.o fulfill what ha& been accepted by the other, ns entailed
by the m.anual partnership between them.

Chap1t, 4: Rcpurahle l'tirtncr, Manual, a11<l ·Cwt1preh•1niVc. Portncnhip,

137'

Manual partnership is §till valid even if the partners do diffenmt kind~ of
WO(k. For example, it is permissi)>le to make a manual p11rtnership between a

tailor aud a metalworker, and so on. Every partuer has the right to demand his
equal share in the profit ruade by the other. Al'so, in oase they lease a place, il is
pennisslble for the tenant to pay any of them the rent; and i11 case they rent a
plare, the landlord has !he right to ask any of them for the rent This is because
each of the two partner.s ls considered a representative of the other, so (hey
share whatever responsibilities or duties due to their manual pa1:tnersltip.
Manual parlJl~rship l~ also valid in case.~ of lawful manual work suth as
cutting firewood, collecting fn1it from mountains, mining, etc.

if one of the partners becomes lil. the profit gain~d by the other sboulcfstill
be divided between both pa,·tners. This is supported by the aforementioned
narration which states that Sa·d, 'Acnmir a11d Ibn Mas' ud made a manual
partnership, and Sa 'd then brought two prisoners, while the others failed to
get any; however, Lhe Prophet (PBUH) made them share in the ownership of
the two prisoners. With regurd to this issue, if tbe healthy partner demanded
the sick one to appoint.a new worker as a substitute. the sick partner is obliged
to agree. This is bec."luse their partnership i.s l:>a6etl on manual work on the part
of both of tl\em. So, if one of them is unable to-work, he has 1D appoint another
inhispiace to maintain the validity of their partnership contract. Therefore, if
the ill pa:rtner refuses to appoint someone in b:is place, the other partner can
cancel the partnership co11tract.
•

1n mam1al pariner$hlp, iris permissible that partn.ers share in theow11erslup
of riding animals or taxi$ and share whatever fares they get &om them, for It

is a means of earning after all. It is also permissible that a pei:son gives an
animal or a taxi to another to work on end share whatever fares they get.
S imilarly, it is permi~-sible that such manual p~rtnership is concluded between
three partners; one provides the animal for example, the other provides tl\e
neu,ssary toois, and .the third works oo it. and that whatever they earn is to
be distributed among them. Lik~wi.ie, such partnership among agenis (who
promote the selling process, di~play the goods. and bring customers) is dee111ed
permissible, and wnatever they earn is to bedislributed ,among them.

Third: Compr~ensive Partnership
It is a type of pnrtncrship in which each partnerautho1•i2.es the ot.ht:1' to
handle freely every aspect of the e::apitai and labor. JI includes all the aforesaid
types of partnership; coo1,erative, reputable p~rtner, manual, and speculative

138

lliPARTNERSHlP

partnerships. JI also iovolv~s 1hai the partners may share what they possess as
well as whatthey owe_
This comprehensive type of partnership is permissible, as it comprises
permissible types of partnership, it is deemed permissible brcaus~ all its
compon~nts are·deemed so.
•
With regard to thls type, the profit is to be distributedin acrordance with
1:he partners' mutual agreement As for the loss, it should be borne according
to ea~h partner's financial contribution,

In this ~y, our sacred Shari'a/, (Islam ic Law) (!](tends the u1eans of
earning within rbe permissible limits. II allows man to get his earning, whether
indi.yiduall)' or through sharing with others, and makes people obliged to
fulfill their conditions, provided they are lawful and just, All th is confirms the
validity and applic;ibility of this Shari'ah everywhere and al any time.
Finally, we invoke Allah to grant us tlie abidance by tl1is sacred Sharf" ,;l1
and lo be.Ip us follow ils path, as He is the Heartngand the Responsive..

Shariecropping
(Muzara 'a,h and Musaqah)
M11ztira 'ah and musciq,ih arc two systems among the systems ofconducting
agricultural transactions which people practiced from the ancient times due to
the dire human need of them. A perso11 may possess a certain number of trees
that he cannot attend to or use. Another may have the capacity to work but he
owns neither trees nor land. Thus" the two systems of muziira 'ah and rr,usaqah
were permitted for the benefit of the two parties, just as all the Islamic legal
transactions which are based upon justice, the achievement of benefits, and
the prevention of causes of corruption.

Musdqdh
Faqihs define musaqah as giving planted or unplantcd trees along with a
piece of land to someone to plant: them therein, water them, and perform the
necessary work until they bear fruit. The farmer then is to be given a specified
share of the fruits of these trees, from an unspecified part of the land, while the
rest goes to their owner.

Muzlra'ah
Muzara' ah is defined as givtag a land to someone LO cultivate or giving a
lan,d along with some seeds to someone to plant Lhem therein and ta)-e care
of the plantation in ren,rn for a specified portion of the harvest, from an
uaspedfied part of the land, while the rest is for the landowner.

A preconditioned part o,f the harvest t11 m11saqil/1 and muztlro •al~ goes \o
the landowner while the resit is for the sharecropper.
'fhe legal evidence of the perinlssibility of musdquh and muzdra 'alt js clear
in the bad/th narrated by Ihm ' !)mar (may Allah be pleased with him) 1n which
he said:

"The Prophet (PBV H) concluded a contract wit/1 the peqplc tlf
Khaybar for them to utilize tlie land on the c<Jndition tllJl! /ialf the
har11est offruits or pl,mts would be their share."'
Moreover, Imam Musliln related:

"The Prophet (PBVf-1) returned to the Jews of Khaybar the duJi,•
palms of K11aybar and their land on the condition that they should
,work upon thcn.1 with their own wealth (seer.ls, impletnents, etc.} in
,.,_
.,
renrmfor half v1 the lwrves!.
Imam Ahmad also related:

~The Prophet (PBUH) gave the 1,eople of Khaybar the d(1te pa/ms
and the land of J(J,4yb,won t11e conditio11 that they will give ha/f Q.f
tire yield (lo Muslims),""
These 1!11d1ths prove the v~lidity of 1111isliqllh in Islam.

tmrun lbncd-Qayyim said:

"In thcstoryofK/taybar. there isa fog11/ e11idenceofthepermissibility
of nmsaqfih and tmLzara ·ah in return for II specified portion of
the yield, be it fruits or crops. The Messenger of Allah (PBVR)
continued dealingwiti~ the people of K11aybar (thrcntgh mus/Jqilh
and muziira 'ah) until his death, and lie never invalidated it. The
Rightly,guided Caliphs continued dealing with t/1ese two systems
as, well, not as a form of rent 'but as a kind ofpartnership which is
ex:,u;tly like sprculation."'

stated !hat it iS' impermissible to :apply this system on fruitless I rees or ones
that beru· fnedthle fruits, as there are no rulings pertaining to ~uch cases.
Among the conditions for the validity of mus6q6h is the estimation of the
sharecropper's or the owner's share with a specified portion of the produce,
like, for example, a third or a quarter, whether the stipulated share is little
or big. AccordJngly, it is invalid if they stipulate that all the yield would be
for-one of them, because in thi6 case one of them wn11ld have all the harvest
while the other would have nothing. It is 11lso invalid to stipulate a certain
number ofid ·~ of the harvest, loo! ten or twenty ia 's. for the trees may yield
nothing but this amount and, in this case., the one with the specified share
would have all the yield. Similarly, if a certain sum of money is stipulated for
~llle of the parties it will be lnvnli,d, for the harvest may not be of the snme
value previously estimated. Moreover, it is inv111id to make the share of one
of them limited to the fruit of on,~ ot some specified trevs, as it may happen
that only those specified Ire.es an! the ones whkh wtll bear fruit, so one of
the parties will have all the harvesL. On the other hand., the specified tree(s)
may no[ bear fruit ,11 aU, and thus the one with the pret::onditioned shate

Ill: SHARECROPPING AND RENTING

The valid opinion maintainecl by the majority of scholars is tha.1 musi!iq_dh
is n binding contract that can1101 be cancelled by one of the. MO pnrnes unless
the other gives his cons~nt It should be for a specified period oftime even if it
is long, so long as the trees are there. lt binds the sharecropper to do whatever
is needed for hav1ng d good harvest: like plowing, watering, removing the
harmful plants, grafting date palms, drying -ihe fruiis, fixing watercourses, and
distributing water runong lhe trees.
The-owner of the trees has to do whatever is nec~-sary to preserve the asset,
nnniely the lrees, by diggiug a well (or proviclirtg any source of water), building
walls, and t he like. The owner has also to provide t!Je materials necessary for
having strong healthy trees like fert.ilizers ,mil the like.

Secondly: Rulings on Mu,ztira' '!It
Giving the seeds to the sharecro11per along wirh the iand by the landowner
is tiot a condition for the validity of rrwzar.a 'ah. Thus. if he hands over the
land to the sharecropper to cultivate using seeds belonging to the lat!er, it ls
considered permissible as rmiatained by some of the P,rophet's Companions
and acted upon by people afterwards, TWs opinion is based on the evidence of
the validity of muzam •ah, llamely the iladitlr illustrating the Prophet's dealing
with the Jews ,of Khaybar in thjs agricultural system; the Prophet (PBUH)
.granted them the land to utifu.e on 1he cooditfon that half the harv~si woul~
be their share. Yet, it was pot 1nentioned in the bndflh that providing seeds was
incumbent on the Musli1ns.
Imamlbnul-Qayyim (may Allah have rnercyoo rum) said:

"Those scholars who stipulme that tlte landlord must provide seeds
Qlong with thi; land (in fllUz:ilm 'ah) bnse their opinion 1m ,m analogy
with the j1iilgme11t pertaining to spewlative partttership, However;
This analogy does nol only contmdict lhe a11t/1e11!ic Su1111ah (Prophetic

regarded as 011e oftl1e worst ,mdrnosf corruptive analogical·deductio11s.

The Jegai proof of Lhe permissibility of 111.UZara 'ah is stated in the
honorable Su1111ah as mentioned above. The need for muz&rn 'ah also calls
for its permissibility, as there arlt many people who own agricultural lands
but cannot attend to them, andl there are many others who can work in
agriculture but do not own lands . Thus. the Islamic legal wisdom asc;ertain5
the permissibility of muzdra 'ah for the benefit of the two parties, the
landlord and the sharecropper. ln this way, cooperation for accomplishing
benefits and avoiding damage$ 11Vill be achieved.

Shaykhul-Jslam, lbn Taymiyah (may J\l)gjl liave,mer(y on him) said:

•Muz,fra 'ah is ofmore basic origi11 than te11ancy and duse.r to maintai11ingjustice. as tile two pmties share t/1e pro/ft as we/li,s fhe-loss."'
lmAm lbnul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
"ft (i.e. muzara ·.ah). is fartlm· from injustir;e and liar/II t/um te.11al!C)',

for in tenancy one of tlie [;•m·rles will ~~trely gai11 profit while i11
muzarn •air, if tltere is a frop, both will share tile p1'ofit, and if there is
not. they will share the lo.1s."$
Having a speci6.ed share for the sharecroppe-r Qi' the landowner from
the crop ls a condition for the val~dity of m11zam 'ah, and the specified sha·re
-should be a known part of the harvest, such asa third or fourth of the harvest:..
This is because the Prophet {PBUH) granl-ed the people of Khaybar the. lands
on the condition that half of the y ield should be for the Muslims,
ff the share of one of the parties is specified, the resi will be fo1· the other;
~ince the yield is theirs. if oneshai:e i5 specifted, the other share wUI be known
accordingly. It is invalid to specify a certain weight of the crop, such as a certain
number of ~ti 's, or to specify 1he :yield of a certain part of the land. for one of
the two parties. It is also invalid forthe landowner to stip11!nte lliat he will take
an amount ofthe crop equal to fhl,r of the seeds he hasprovldi:d and then they
both shate the rest, This is because the land may not yield bul this anwunt,
and in such a case, the landowner· will have all the •crop and the sharecropper
will have nothing. It was narrated thar when Rilfi' lbn Khadlj (may Allah bee
pleas~d with him) was asked about renting land in return for gold and silver
(I.e. dinars and dirhruru; money), he said;

"'There is 110 /l(lr/11 ill it. Howeve,; people (landowners) 11sed to rent
their lands during the lifet'im e ofthe Messengct ofAllah (PBUlf) In

land. Sometimes the ,,egetation n/ tlie specified area wns damaged
(by bliglits) ,vhile the rest remained safe. and vice Versa. People
,did not rent tlreir lands except t/1rough that way. Yet, the Prophet
(PBUH) prohibited it, because it involves harm to people's interests
rhar may lead to disputes and de11ouring people's weoll/1 unjustly.
However, lftere Is no /',arm in renting the /mid for somet/,ing
specij1ed a111tg11aranteed (such ,is silver 411d gold; tnottey)."'
This narration proves the unlawfulness of 11mzilm 'ah in return for what

may bring about harm and dispute among peopl~.
Jbnul•M~dhir said:

"Records reported from R/lft' came wit/, reasons which demons/rote
that the Prophetic prohibition was for tl1ese same reasons !hey did
habitually. Rtlfi' said, ''We use,J to rent tire land for the yield of a

Renting Thtings and Hiring
People's Sc~rvices (Ijarah)

The contracts of renting and hiring coniinually recur in rhe lives of people
concerning their different interesl<s and their daily, monthly and yearly dealings.
Thus, it is important to know thi: rulings pertaining to such dealings, for all
people's dealings, wherever and whenever they are, are codified in Shari'ah
(Islamic Law) in accordance with legal norms which guard interests and put
an end to harm.

lj/Jrah means renting something or hir ing someoqe's- services in return for
a certain paymi!nt, Allah, Exalted be He, says:

". .. [Moses] said, 'lfyou wished, you co1lld have taken for it
a payr,umt:"
(Qur'an: AJ-Kahf: 77)
According to Muslim jurists, Ulirah is defined as follows: a lease for a lawful
identified use of either an identifi<~d present or described anticipated thing, for

111: SHARECRQPl!ING AND RENTING

148

a specified purpose ancf foq1 known period of time, or (a hiring agreement) for
the performance of-a certal:i~ servke in rerurn for a specified compensation.
The aforesaid general d1~finition comprises most of the validity conditions
for if/i.Jrih as well as 1ts typet;:
• The phrase "a lea8e for a ... ltse'" implies that the hmng of slaves is- not
included In ijcirali, lfor it is rather selling than hiring or renting in this
C'1Stl,

• The word "lawful" eltcludes all kinds of renting or hiring for unlawful
use, like adultery for example.
• The phrase "identified use" excludes: any unknown benefit or use
through ij/Jrah, ill \llhich cas~ the lease becomes invalid.

• The phr;ise "a fowti:!I identified use of either an identified (present)
or described anticipated thing... or (a hiring agreement) for the
performance of a certaill service" indicates that ijarah is of two types:

Firstly, ljilrah can .b,e for the use of an identified (present) or described
anticipated thing. An example of renting an jdentified thing is when
a landlord says, "I rent you this house'; while an example of.renting a
described .thi:ng is when an owner of a pack animal who rents it says, "I
rent you a pad< aniinal of such and such a description for transporting
or riding."
•
Secondly, ijltrah cail also be hiring 5omeone for performing a specific
service, like, for ttxample, someone who hires another to drive him to
such and such a place. or to build him a wall or the like.
• The phrase "for a .known period of time" means that the rent period
should be specified; a day or a month, etc.
• The phrase "fur a specified compensapon" indkates the ne~essity of
specifyi.ng the p~yment fw reuting something or hiring someone.
Thus.all thevaliditycondHionsofthetwo typesofijnrah can be summarized
in the following:
• 'The lease has to be h:lated to the use oflhe object, 11ohhe object itself.
• This use,oftheobjecl: shoLtldbe lawful.
• 'I'he purpose of ,.,nling should be known.
• If the rem object ls not identified (present), ii should agree With the
description of its owner.

J1\)

• The renr period shouid,be specified.
• The rental payment should be specified.
The valid ijaraliis permissible according to the Qur'An, theSrmna/1 (Prophetic
Tradition), apd juristic consensus:
• Allah, Exalted be He, says:
~... Atui if tl1ey breastfeed for you. tl1e11 give tl1e111 tlieir payment..!'

(Qurti:n: At-Talaq: 6)

Allah aliio says:
': .• /Moses] sa{d, 'Ifyou wlsl1ed, you cmtld have taken for it a
payment.'"
(Qur'an: Al-l<nhf. 77)
• The Prophet (PBUH) also hi-red a man to show him rhe way during h1s
Emigratioi1 from Mecca to Medina.
• lbnul-Mundhirstated t11atj uriststinanimouslyagreeon the'permissibi Ii ty
1
of ijarah ( renting something or hiring someoqe•s service) ,
Moreover. ijdrah is a human necessity, as there is need for the benefits·()[
rent as much as there is need for the objects of rent.

It !s permissible to hire a person .for 11 ·c ertain job, such as for taiioring a
garment, building a waU. or for 11uiding one through one's way. ftis stated )1:i

~abib Al-Bukhari ( Al•Bt,kharik Al1tlle11tic Book of IIadith} th.it •A'ishah (tbe
Prophet"s wife. may Allab be pleased with her) narrated ln Lhe f1adlth of t·be
Prophet's Hijrah (£migration to Medina):

liffn) etnployed "Abdulltili Jbn Urayqit Al,Laythf as a guide; he WCtS

ft is \mpermissiblc: to rent how,es, shops and stores for committing sins,
sudl as selling intoxicants or forbiddeA things like tobacco or making pictures,
as renting here is considered ~n assistance in comm ittlng sins,

It is permissiJ:?le for a tenant to rent what he has rented to someone elst to
make use of; for the tenant is considered a temporary owner of what he rents·.
Thus, it is permissible for hirn to use it or let someone else use it instead. Still,
rhe second tenant must use. the rented object in the same way of the titSr,
or in a betteP way. For example, a tenant of a house can rent it lo another
tenant provided the latter uses it for living the-rein or for a less damaging 11se.
However, it is impermissible for him to rent the: place for someone who Will
use it as a factory or a laboratory.

III: SHARECJIOrPING AND R.EN'FrNQ

15U

If is i,npermissible to hire someone to petfonn .acts of worship or piety
that bring one near- lo Aliah, such as perforrni11g liajj (pilgrimage), on one's
behalf. Qr annoum;ing the prayer call (ad/1411) . This is because such deeds
are individuaUy performed to draw one ,;loser to Allah, and receiving wages
for thecti· makes them far away from be.ii1g ocl§ of worship. However, i\ is
pern:ilssible to receive financial support from the Muslims' Public Treasury
for acts of transcending benel'ils, sucb as performing Hajj, announcing prayer
Clltl (adlu'lri), leading people in prayer, le~chin~ the QuNin.and ft.qi, (Islamic
Jurisprudence), jt1dgtng, alld delivering fatwa ·. Receiving pa)'lllent in such
cases is not a kind of cornpens,it'ion, but rather a help to perform .ads of
obedience. ThJsdoes ,101 void such pious and righteous acts, nor does it affect
the ~iucerity oftheir perforrparice.

Shaykhul-lslo.m Ibo Taymiyah (1m;y Allah have mercy on him) Sllid:
"Faqi/~, 1.1-mmimcmsly 11gree 011 tire ilijference between hinng to
perform various acts of worship and granting fmancial Jll/)porL foi:

l'bn Tayl'l!iyal\ also sajd:

The Duties of a Lessor and a Lessee

• A les.~or has to do whatever can help the lessee to benefit from the object
of rent, such as fixing the rented car and preparing it for working and
frelght, and reconsrructing the rented house and fixing wharever ls
damaged therein and ,preparing ,ts utiliti~s for use.
• When the period of rent is over, a lessee has 10 ~IX wha1e..-er damages hehas caused,

Ch•p1ct '2: Rm ting 'Thlngs ond Hiring People', &rviccs (/jJmh)

151

• ljiirali (renting) is a blndlng conlrllct for the two parties, the lessnr and
the lessee, for it is regarded as a kind of sale, so the judgments of sale
~pplies to it. A lessor or a lessee cannot cancel the iease except with the
consent of the other. But if a certain defect appear.~ about l)'hich the
lessee has not been infooned before signing the contract, he ha6 the
right to •cancel it.
• The lessor is obliged to hand over the object of rent to the lessee, and
to· enabk him to utillze it. If the lessor rents· something a11d then
prevents the lessee from using lt during all or some of the period of
rent, he has no right to receive all or some of the rent~l. for he has 1101
hapded the lessee what the !'ease has stated. If the lessor enables the
lessee 10 utilize the object ofrerit bur did nor take t.he rent during all
or some of the period of lease, full rent is due upon the lessee. This is
because the lease ls a binding one, thus what ls stated therein should
be carried out; rental is the right of the lessor while utilization 'is the
right of the lessee.

Two Cases in Which the Lease -Can be Cancelled
First: when the object of rent ls damaged, as in lhe case. when one rents
a riding a11ima1and then ft dies, or a house and then it collapses, or a
land ti;,r cultintio,~ ~nd then it ~ecomes deprived of water.
Second: When the purpose of.rent'ing or hiring i.~ no ionger there.as in the
case when a person hires or sends for a physjdan to treat hlm and then
he beco111es well before the physician treats him. In such a case, ,the
hiring agreement is canceled because its purpose is no longer there.

When someone is hired for a certain work and he becomes ill, someone
else has to be hireq at his expense to replace him, unles:, it is stipulated that>the
workshould be done by the otjginal hired person. This is because tfie purpose
of hiring may not be achieved through another person. ln this case, the hirer
does not have to.aa ept the work of a person other than the one he has hired,
but he is given the 9ption either to wait until the hired person gets well or to
cancel the contracl because he <;at1not get his right.

A Hired Person fs of Two J{jnds
1-Private hired person: One who i6 hired for a specifi~ period of time,
during which all his work is a due right only to one person, the one
'Who hires him, with no partners (~uch as a servant or a d river}.

.152

lli: SHARECROPPING ANO RENTING

2>Publlc hired perscnnt One whose usefulness is· estimated according
to his work, which ii; not dedicated to one person, but he can work for
more than,one person at a time (such as a tailor).

A priv.ate liired person is not financially liable fot ,vhat he damages by
mistake duringhis work, such as the case when the machine or the 100! he is
using is damaged. This ls b,:cause he is regarded as the owner's deputy, thus
heis not asked for r-ecompense. However, pe isto,compensate for whatever he
damages out of negligence. t:ransgression, or misuse.
As for a public hired person, he is financfatly,liable for wl\a\(;'ver h~ damages
because he does not deserve h:is payment except lhrough·the accomplishment
of his work. Hence, he is financially liable for his work, arid whatever he
damages falls under pis liabjlity:
The payment of the hirecl person becomes due through the hiring c-ontract.
He cannot ask for his wages ,;x,oeptafter delivering the work, which is regaided
as his obligation, accomplishing the service, or handing over the obje,t of rent
(in case of renting, not hiti[1g) after the period of rent is over, provided there
is no hindrance. This is because the hired person is paid hi9 due compensation
after finishing his work or dlelivering what is in his responsibility. In fact, the
payment for renting or hiring is a kind-0f compensation, so it is not due except
after the delivery e>f the compensatory object, be it-a service or an object.
A hired person has to perfect and compl~te his work; he is forbidden to
cheat or deceive. He also h,as to co11tl nue the work during 1:he period he :ls
hired in, and he is not to waste any time during that period w)thout workjng,
A hired person has to fear Allah -while performing his due work.
On the other hand, the duty of a hirer is to pay the person whom he hired
hiK complete wages upon fir,tighing the work he is hired to do, The Messenger
e>f AUah (PBUH) said:

"Give the laliorer his wages before his sweat is dry (i,e. immediately
after he finishes his work)."'
Abu Hurayrnh (may A:iJah be pleased with him) also narrated that the
Prophet (PBUH) said:

'!41/ah, Exalted be He, says; 'I will ·be agllinsl three (persons) 011, lhe
Day of.ludgment - and f defem whomever .I am against 011 the Day
ofJudgment: otle who makes a: covenant in My Name but he proves
treacherous; one who sells a free person (as a slave) and eats the
price; and one who employs a laborer and gets the full llior.k do11e
by /Jim b,.,t does not p,')' him Ms wages! "
(R,clated by Al-Bukhari and other compilers of fladit/1)''

Chapter 2: Rcnc,ng ·th111g., ~nd Hiring Pi:opl<'s Services (lj,imh)

The work of a h1red per:son, a laborer, Is a .trust In his responsibility; lie

Competition (Sabq)

Competition in Shari'ah refers to a race between two animals or contests
such as archery and shooting.
Such r.ices and contests are permissible according to the Qur'an, Simnah,
and juristic consensus, as they may be used to improve abilities.
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"And prepare against them whatever you are able ofpower..:'
(Qur'~n: Al-Anf~l: 60)
Moreover, the Prophet (PBUH) said, "Indeed, strengt/1 is (in) archery."'
Allah, Exalted be He, states in the Qur'an that the brothers of Yusuf (Joseph)
said,'~ ..indeed we went racing each other..:' ( Qur'an: Yusuf. 17), i.e. competing
with each other through archery or running. Abu Hurayrah also narrated that
the Prophet (PBUH) said:

Ill: ~HARECROl'l'JNC AND RENHNG

'"No (reward should be given for) a competition except that made
between (aniinals wlth) boojs (like camels), or (those wit/I) cloven
hCJofs (like horses) -or (arms with) blades (in fencing)."
/Related 'by the Five C9mpilers of Hat.11th)'
This h.adfth shows that entering competition for seeking a certain reward
is perm111Sible.
Many scholars stated the unanimousjur,istlcagreementon the permissibility
of racing and contests. Sbaykul•Isliim Ibn 'Taymiyah (may Allah have ll]ercy
on him} .said:

''Horseracing a11d ari:hery 1111d s11d11ike warlike cmttests enjoined by
Allah and His Messenger (PBUH) are permissible, as they are useful
i11 jihad (flghtil1g in 1he Cause ofAl/l1h)."
He al&o said:

"Wrestling, mrming races a,1d t/ie like are acts ofobed.ie1rce (lo Alla/1)
iffhey 11re inte11dedfor re11deri11g [slam victorloos, and takingrewnrd
(or prize) for winning tltem is also permissible."·'
Such spons are permissible if there is. !)o harm in them. [bn Taymiyah
alsoSJ1id:

"Whatever distmcts one from performing whqt A/IQh /,as ordained
is prohibited - even if ii Is origirratiy perm~s;ble - such as 5el/ing,
trading and aii otlter activities the idle divert themselves with. und all
kinds of sports that do hot ltelp i11 achieving a legal purpose; all such
acts are prohibited."'
Scholars paid such great.attention to this issue that they use.d to spe~ify a
chapter in their well-knowll'volumes and writings for it, entitling it "Chapter
on Heroism?'

Heroism Is of Four Kinds:
!-Horsemanship contests and how to attai:k and retreat with horses
2-Arcliery contests or their e.quivafentsaccording to every age
3-Spear throwing and marksmanship contests
4-Fencing contests

Chapter :I: Compccicion IS.rbq)

l57

Whoevu ticels in these f6ur kinds has completed the aspect~ of heroism.
It is permii.-.ible to race on foot (as in tunning rates) or using any riding or
pack animals..Imllm Al-Qurtubl (may Allah have mercy on httn) said:

"There is no disagrtetl'ient on the permissibility of horsema11Ship
racing, racing through othe1' riding beasts, andjoot racing (such as
running). Similarl)\ atohery contests and other weapo11 contests are

"No (reward should be giwn for) competition except that rnade

hoofs (like horses) or (arms with) blades (infenGing).''
(Related by the Five Corr,pilers of Hactilh oo flie authority of
A'.bti 'Hurayrah)
This means that it is impermissible to get a re.ward (or a prize) for a
competition e~cept for camel- riding races, horsemanship, and arcl1ery
contests, fot these are the toe,!~ of war the Prophet (PBUH) enjoined
Musll'ms to .learn 110d master. The meaning of the aforesaid hadlfh is that it is
Impermissible to receive prizes ifor other kinds of competitions. The hadith
may also mean thnt these three a.re the worthiest kinds of competitions 10 be
practiced due to their significanJ: .ind general beneJits. Thus, we can say that
every competition that bene.flts ,religion is: permissible, as indicated in the

Lending Something for Use
( 'A.riyah)

Faqihs (may Allah have mercy on all of them) define 'clriyah as a permission
for benefiting from an article whose use is permissible, and then the borrowed
article remains until it is returned to its owner.
The aforesaid def.nit.ion excludes whatever is impermissible to use, for
such a thing is naturally prohibiied to be lent, It also excltrdes any object that
cannot be used without b.eing consumed, such as food and drink.
Lending objects for use is legal according to the Qurln, the Sunnah
(Prophetic Tradition), and Juristic consensus:
• Allah, Exalted be He, states in the Qur'an that He dantns those who
", .. withhold [simple] assistance." (Qur'an: AI-Ma'un: 7) The verse
refers to those who withhold the different wares and articles that
people use and lend each other. Those who abstain from lending such

UI: SHARF.CRCirPING AND RENTING

162

objects to people tn dire need of rhem ate dispraised in the abovementioned v'erse that proves th~ obligation of lending as maintained
by Shoykhu!-Islam lbn Taymiyah (mair Allah have mercy -On him.),
provided the owner of the needed object is well-to-do '.
• It is stated in the S1111n'1lt that the Prophet (,!>BUH) borrowed a horse frqm
Ab\i Jalnah' and also borrowed shields frC)m .Safwau Jbn Umayyah '"
Lending something to someone who badly needs it is regarded as an act
ofobedience to Allah, for whicn the lender wiU be greatly rewarded by Alfah.
This is because it falls under the general meaning of mutual assi~rance and
cooperation in righteousness and piety.

There are Four Conditions for the Validity of Lending
1) The legal competence of the lender to lend, as lending is a ltjnd of
donation which is invalid to be done by a minor, an insane person, or
a fooli6h-and we.1k•minded ,one.
2) The legal competence of the borrower to be lent; he must b~ legally

competent to accept the terms of the ;igreement (to give the lent
article back).
3) the pei:roissil>ility -0fusing the leot object~for exarnple,.it IS bnpermi.s•
sible for a Muslim t0 lend a Muslim slave to a disbeliever. Similarly, 1t is
impermissible to lend a hunting tool to one tn thesta-te of if1ra111 (ritual
consecration duringHaif or •Ummh); Allah, Exalted be He, says, ". ..but
do not cooperate 111 si11 a11d aggression ..." ( Qur'an: AI-Ma'idab-: 2).
4) T/le lent a rticle must remain as it is after use. not to be consumed as
mentioned above.
The loaner can retrieve the lent object whenever he wishes unless it
results ln c~using harm to the borwwi:-r, as, for <>JCample, when a per&O!l lends
something that causes damages to the borrower if it is reclaimed hrthe loaner
while it is being used. To ,illustrate, ifsomeone lends another a ship to carry his
goods, he cannot reclaim it so long as i i is in the sea, Another example is that
if someone permits another 10 use hi.~ wall 10 support his wood on, the owner
may not reclaim his wall 11s long as the wood is on lt.
The borrower must preserve the loan more than he preserves his own money,
so as lo gi.ve ii back to its owner undamaged. Allah, Exaited be He, sayst

"lt1tleed. Allah comma,rds you to re11der trusts to wl,om t/ley
are due..."
(Qur'an: An•Nisa: 58)

This verse proves the obligation of rendering back trusts, lncludtng loanN.
safe to their owners. Moreover, the Prophet (l>BUH) said:
"TI,e liand (1·eferring to mi111) has to give hack w/1at II had taken
(by means of botrowing, stealing, ctc.).1'''
He (PBUH) also said:

''Render tht ttusl to him w/10.enttusted you (with it).'''
The ;,tbove legal teicts prove the obligation of safekeeping whatever une is
entrusted with and returning it in a good condition to its owner. Loans are
indicated in the general meanirig of these texts. as the borrower is in fact
entrusted with what he bonow:s and he 1s obliged to return it; he is only
permitted 10 use it within the limit!s ofusual usage. Tl)w;, it is fmperrnissib1t for
a borrower- to overuse the borrowed object in a way·that may d11mage it. nor is
he permitted to use it unsuitably or improperly, for Ire-is not given permission
to use it that war- Allah, Exalted lbe He, says:
"1s the reward for good [,anytl,ing] b"t good?"
(Qur'an: Ar-Rahman: 60)
If the borrower uses the loan for any purpose 01hev than that for which
1t has been lent and thw; it is d,amaged, he has. !O compensa1e for it, as the
Prophet (PBUH)-said:
"The ha,1d (referring to 1111111) has to give back what if had taken
(by mea/15 of borrowing. stt:alirig; etc.)."
(Related by the five Compilers-of Hadit/1, and Al-Hakim regarded
it a& a i11b.lb. (authentic) b.<11-1!1/I,)
This /ladit/1 proves the obligation of returning whatever one has borrowed
from another, and that one is not free from this dut)' except through returning
!he loan to its owner or io someo,ne on his behalf.
However, if the borrowed object is damngcd while being properly u,sed,
·the borrower is not financially li~,b\e for it, as the lender has permitted }iirn for
such proper utilization. Thus, th,e borrower ill not-obliged to make up for any
damage resulting from such peninitted use,
Jt ls impermissible for the borrower to lend I.he borrowed thing, because
whoever is permitted to use something is not permitted to lend it to someone
else, for this will subject it e\?en nnore to be damaged.

lll: SHARECROPJ'ING AND RENTING

Scholars disagree on theot;ligation of the borrower's liability for the damage
of the Joan due to misme. Some scholars maintain that l t is obligatory for the
borrowei, to make up for the damaged loan, whether he. haS' used lt properly or
not. They base their opioio11 on the general me11niog of tlie follo1¥ing fl4ditl1;
!he Prophet (PBUH):
"The /ia,td (refer-ring to man) has ro give (:14ck what it had taken
(by means of bormwfrig, stea/irig, etc.)."
'This. applies; fur e.,camp)e, 1¥he11 the borrowe~ beast 9jes, the borrowed
ganneot is burned, oc the borrowed object is- stolen. However, some scholars
ate of the opinion that a borrower is not financially liable for the loan so iong
as he has not transgressed in lts udliz.ntlon; he is liable for it ortly when he
misuses it 1/echaps this is tbe most liJsely opinion·, i\S the borrower gm (he
loan with the permission of its owner, so it is regarded as a.trust kept by him.
The borrower has to safeguard I.he loan, care for it, and return it to its
owner as soon as he achieves the purpu~e of borrowing jt. He shoufd by no
meaos be negligent in using it or expose it to damage. This is because the loan
i~ regarded as a trust kept by the borrower, and its owner is supposed to have
done good to him; AUah, E,cnlted be He, says:

"Is t11e reward far good / anything) but goodru

Usu1rpation
According to the faq,hs, usui·pation refers to usurping other's possessions
by force without having the right to take them.
Usurpation is prohibited according to juristic consensus, for Allah, Exalted
be He, says:

''.And do not consume on,e another's wealth unjustly..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 188)
Usurpation is considered ome of the grievous ways of eating up money
unjustly, for the Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Verily, your blood, proper.ty and honor are sacred to one another
(as Muslims):''
He (PBUH) also said:

"The property of a Muslim is not lawful (to be taken) except by
.,
.
h,s consent.

In: SHARECR,Ol'PfNG AND RENTING

166

The usurped we;ilth coulid be real estate or a movable property; the Prophet
(PBUH) sai\J:
•

'"Tj anyone ~torts 11 sp~m ofland ,mju,tiy. his neck will be encircled
witJr it down seven ear;fhs (on the Day of Resurrection),"'
A usurper bas 10 repent to Allah, Almighty and Ever-Majestic be He,
and return whatever he has extorted to its rightful owners, asking them for
for:giveness-. The .llrophet ( PBUH) .said:

''Who~ver wrongs cmym,e in a matter that concerns his honor or
1111y other rn11tter sho~,/d llSk his forgiveness as Joon as possible,
before a time comes when tliere is neither dinar 11ur dirliam (i.e.
before the Dlly C!fResunection when wealth cannot compensate for
one's wrorigdoi"g); if the usurper lras good deeds, they wilI be taken
from him acrording to his 11s11rpatio11, and tfhehas no good deeds,
lite sins of t/ie oppressed person will be loaded 011 him."'
If the usurped properly is available, he should return it in the same
condition he has taken it. but if it ls d;1maged, he should re.turn lts equivalent.

Imllm AJ-Muwaffaq said:

''Scholarsunanimous/y,zgtee that ii is obligatory to retqrh the llsurpe4
property if it is still in the same condiHoh and 11ntl1a11ged:;
Furthermore. the u.surpe1: has to pay back the usurped property along with
the profit he has made through it. be it connected with the property or separated.
This is bee.tllSe the. profit is the outc-0me.of what has been taken unjustly, so It
belongs to its rightful owner _just like the original usurped property.

If the usurper has built on the usurped land or has planted l'egetation
therein, he has to remove the building or the crop in the <;11$e the rightful
owner dem>111ds so. The Prophet (PBUH) said:
"The 1tnju.st root (plant,id in someo1lesland withoirt 11is pennis;;/on)
f,as 110 rig/,t."
(Related by At -Tirmidhtaod other compilers of Hadtth; At-Tirmidhi
6
rego.rded•it as a b,asat1 (1~ood) b.adit/1)
If so doing will negatively affect the land, the usurper has to compensa.tefor the damage. He has also to remove the remains of the crop or the structure
so !hat he may deriver the land In good condition to its rightfpl owner.

Chapter 5: Ururpati0)1

167

Tlie usutper bas also lo pay Q compensation for using lhe land from t'he.
date of its usurpation until its- delivery, as he has uruightfully prevented its
owner from using it during lhat period. Moreover, if the usurper withholds the
usurped pr6perty until its value and price are reduced, be has to pay it back
according to its original price according to the sound opinion mthis regard.
Qn the other band, if the usurped object is mixed with something else
that can be distinguished from it - like wheat and barely - the usurper has to
-separate what he has usurped and return it. If he has mixed ii with something
that cannot be distingui5hed1 such as mixing wheat with wbeat, he has to p~y
back the usurped object in measure or weight. Yet, ifhe has mixed the usurped
objec1 with ·something of inferior or .superior qua'llty, or with somethingdifferent but indislinguishable, the mixture is to be, sold and ,each one of
them ls-to be given ms share of the price. ln this ca.se, If the value of usurped
property is less in the mixture than ils value when unmixed, the usurper has
to compensate the owner for the, decrease in its prioe.
Among the jurislic opinions in this connection is that whoever- takes
the usurped property from 1he usurper is fin.1nc.ial1y liable for ii in case it is
ilamaged in his possession,
There are ten examples of people who may take a usurvecL property from
the usurper:
1, One who may buy the usurped object from the usurper or the like.
2. One who may rent tlie usurped object from the usurper,
3. One wbo may be granted tJ1e usurped object by the u~nrper gratis,
4. One who may take possession of the usurped object on behal£ of the
usurper such 11s o trustee or a deputy;

5. One who may borrow the usurped object from the usurper.
6. One who may usurp the usurped object from the first usurper.
7. One whnmay have the usurped obj.e cUt his disposal, sueh as a speculaidr
on behalfof the usurper.
8. One who may mar ry ail appropriated bondruaid from her usurper,
9. One whom t he usurper may grant. not sell him, the usurped object as.
a compensation for something.
10.0ne who may damage the usurped object while having if on behalf of
the usurper.

TIT: SH/\lllKROr,rTNG ANO RENTfNG

168

In all these ,cases, if the sec.oud party is aware that fhe object is orlgioally
usurped, he becomes financially liable for it for obtaining something without
the permi~-sion of its rightful owner, Howi::ver, if he is u.n,aware of that, l:he
original usurper shoulders the liability.
If the usurped pro_perty is something that is usually rented, the usurper js
to pay compensation estimated according to the period of bis po$session of
the usurped property. This is because utilities represent assets, so they have to
be paid for jll5tlike rat estate.

All the dealings of a usurper on the usurped Qbjec·t are invlilid, ~s they are
carded out without the permis.~ion of the rightful,owner.

lf the usurper does not know the owne.r of the usurped object and thus
is unable to return it to him, he should deliver il L6 the ruler (or the one In
authority) to put it in its right place or give it in charity on behalf of it~ owner.
In so doing, the real owner of the usurped object will get the reward ofcbarity,
and the usurper becomes ,free from the gum,
The usurpation ofa property is not llmiled lo .raking it by force;il rather includes
seizing it through unjusl disputes and false oaths. .Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"And do 1101 cons11me 011e another's wealth unj11.stly or semi ii
[in bribery) to the fttlers in order that [they might aid] yo11 [io]
consume a portio11 !'f the wealth of 11,e people in sfli, while you
know {it is rm(awfrdj.»
(Qur'an: AI-Baqarah: 188)

.Allah also·says:
''Indeed, thrue who exchange Im covenant of Allah a,rd their
[ow,, Joathsfor a small price will /,ave; no shim, in the Hereafter,
and Allah will not spiak to t/um or wok at tlrem on the Day
of Resurrcction, nor will He purify them; and they will have a
pai,iful punishment:'
(Qur'am Alu ' Imran: 77)
ln fact, the Divine command i8 so strong and binding, and the punishrntnt.
of yioJatin.git is so severe.

Moreover, the Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Ifanyone extorts a span of land u,rjustly, liis 11eck will b~ eneirG/ed
witn it down seve11 earth~ (01/ Ifie D11y of Re;11rrection).".
He (PBUH) also said:

Damage and Damages
Allah has prohibited usurpin.g other people's property and has imposed
Ii.ability for whatever is damaged of the property taken without right even if by
mistake. Whoever damages anothers property - and this being considerable
- without its owner's permission, is financially liable to make up for it.

Imam AI-Mm;~ffaq said:
"There is no juristic disagre,m1ent in this regard, whether the damage is intentional or not, ar.,d whether the one causing it is legally
accountable or not."

Similarly, whoever causes th,e damage of another's wealth i,~ financially
liable for it. For example, when one opens a gate causing what is locked iJJ to
be lost or stolen, or when one unfastens a container causing what is therein
to be wasted and damaged, one i!; liable for them. Likewise, if someone ties a
riding animal in a narrow street causing a passerby to stumble and be harmed
or injured, he has to pay him for the damage caused. This is exactly like the

172

III: SHARECROl'P£NG JI.ND REN'DN<.;

one who parks a car in the middle ofthe- street and as a result another ca:r or
a person is hit, whereby damage is caused, ,t he one who bas parked the c;1r is
liable to Jl\ake up for the damage. This opinion Is ba~ed on the b.ad/th relat~d
by Ad-baraquJ;ni and other compilers of l;;[pdith that states:
"If 011e ties a riding animnl Ir, one of the pathways of the Muslims,
or in one oftheir markets, and it treads oti someone (or something)
1
by 011e ofitsfro,it or b(ltk legs, one is liable forit."

The same ruling appfies when one leaves clay, a piece of wood or a stone in
a pathway or digs a hole in it, causing harm or injury tou passerby. In the same
way; if someone throws watermelon peels or lets waret in tbe street, causing
a passerby to slip and get inju~. he· is tQ make up for it. People who do a)I
such actions are financially llable for the resulting damage. as such deeds, ate
regarded as tr.insgression.
Unfortunately; there are: rn.my such instances of carelessness everywhere
nowadays; too many holes are heedlessly dug on the road~ .and streets. too
ma11y bloc.ks and obstacles are pul therein, and too much damage is caused
by that heedlessness due to the lack of control and supervision. Some people
may even occupy streets as if they were their own, dedieating them fur thein
own U6e, caW1iog harm to those passing by without caring for .the sins they are
committing in this,Wl!y or the punishment that a wails them.
Among the matters rbat incur financial liability is when one has a mad
dog that assaults the passersby or bites any of them. The owner of the dog
is liable to make up for the resulting damages or injuries, for having such .i
dog is an act of transgression. On the other hand, if someone digs a weU tn
his courtyard for his own benefit, he is financially liable for any damage that
might be caused through it; he is obliged to keep it in a condition that prevents
harmln.gthe pissersby. However, ifhe leaves it without such precautions, he is
deemed a transgressor:
Moreover, if someone owns c;itt.le. he is obliged to keep them away
from damaging other people's crops especially at night; otherwise he ls
financially liable for whatever they damage. The.Prophet (PBUH) judged
in sucb a case:
'"l11e DWJters of property (i.e. ,att/e) sl,011/d keep it during, the
dayti111e ·arid they are liab/e for tlie damages they (t/1c caWe) ca11se
during the nighttime."

In the Qur'an. Allah mentions a story abou1 Prophets Dilwud (David) a.nd

Shaykhlil-hlam Ibn Ta:)'miyab (may Allah have mercy on him) said,

"The it1juries or damages ca11sed by animals like cows. sheep, and
tl,e like are not to be compensated (by the ow11er) if tltey are off a

The same opinion is maintained by some, other scholars, who state lh,ll
there is no compensation (for the damage caused) if the animal escapes and
wa,Jders about ainilessly without 1l leader or " rider, unless it is a wild beast~-

ln addition, if someone is a ttacked by a numan being or an animal, and
killing theniis'lhe only way to stop them, there wlll he no compensatjon on
that person in case he killed then-i . Thi, is because killing here is a means of
self-defense which is permissible, so there is no liability for its consequences.
Morwver, the killing of an assauHer is intended to prevent its harm, so one

T1rusts
According to the Shari 'ah (Islamic Law), entrustment is deputing someone
for the voluntary preservation of something, committing it into his care.
"Trust" refers to the property the truistee is entrusted with.safekeeping without
recompense.
The conditions of the validity of entrustment is the same as that of deputa•
tion, namely maturity, sanity, and puberty, for entrustment is deputation for
the purpose of safekeeping.
It is desirable for one to accept to be entrusted with something ifhe knows
flimself to be honest enough and capable of keeping trusts. This is because
safekeeping trusts has a great reward; the Prophet (PBUH) said:
~ ..And All.ah helps a pers()n so long as the person helps his (M11s/im)
brother."'

However, ifone is not sure that heis capable of keeping trusts, it is detestable
for him to accept them.

Among the rulings on, entrusunent is that lf the trust is damaged while
beingu1 the care of the trustee who l\as not 1)1isused it, hewiU not be frnancfaliy
liable for it. This is because a trust ls regarded as the trustee's own property,
so he does not make up for it if it is dan1aged, provided he does not abuse it.
Jbn Majah related a /iadith ' - which has a rather weak c;'haln Qf t~ansmit:ters
- stating that the Prophet (!'BUH) said:

"Ifone is tnisted with something, Ihen he is 1101 liablefor compen-sat;on (if it is damaged)."

Ad-Diroqutni related lhe same hadith" with the following word111g:
"There is no compan~ation lo be paid by a,; i,onest borrower (if t/1e
borrowed object is darr1qged), and there rs 110 compensation lo he
paid by.an hone.st trustee (if the trusted objerrJ' is damaged)."
[11 another narration:

''There is no compcns,1tion to 'be paid by the tn,stee (if tile tmsted
object is damaged):''
A trustee Reep, a trust voluntarily. So, if people are IJablc for the trusts
th~y keep, they will refrain from safekeeping_one anuthers· trusts, which \ml
negatively affect their dealings and hanl_per their Interests. l:fowever, he who
misL16es a tr~t or neglects keeping it properly is liable to make up for it in case
it is damaged, for he is regarded as a damager of another's property.
Another ruling on ent.rustrnent ts !hat the tr,ustee has to secure the trust
jnsl as he secures his own proper!); for Allah, Ex:n.lted be He, has coft)manded
us to render trusts safe to their owners, Allah says:

"'Indeed, Allah commands yo11 to r e11der trusts to whom ,tliey
are due..."
(Qur'An: An-Nisa: 58)
Trusts cannot "be rendered safe to their owners without preserving thein,
and when the, trustee accepts the trust, he has obligated himself to keep it, so
he has to fulfill his obligation.
If the trust is a beast, the trustee is to fodd\!r it, but if he does not supply it
with fodder without the permission of its owner. causing it 'harm, tlie trustee
becomes liable to make up for 11. This is because foddering animals is an
.obligation, in addition to the trustee's obligation to take care of the entrusted
animal. Tl\us, the trustee is consldered sinful if he stops providing it with food
and water until it dies, Ge.neraUy, one should provide such animals with fodder
and water for the sake of Allah, Exalted be He, as their lives have in¥iolabi.l(ty.

.Chap_ttt 7: Ttuscs

[tis permissibie for the trustee, to leave the trust with whomever he usually
entrusts his own _property, such as his wife, his slave, his treasurer, or his
servant.Jo this case, if the trust ls damaged while being in the care of anyone
of them without the latter being negHgenr Or transgressing, the trustee is
not liable to make up for it This is because it is pem1issible for a trustee
to k.e~p the trust bf hi.mself or by deputing someone trustworthy to keep
ii on his behalf, 1,ikewise, tf the trustet1 c9mmil$ the trust to someone who
afready preserves the property of lts owner hone'stly, he (the oi:iginal trustee}
becomes free from the obligation of safekeeping it, as the social convention
goes. However, if the trustee delivers it to a person who is a stranger to him
and to the owner of the trust, he becomes liable for compensation in case
it is damaged. This is because he is not to entrust it w1th anyone elGe unless
j here ls a compelling excuse. For example, If the tr ustee is breathing his last,
or if he has s uddenly to travel an1d fears that the trust might get damaged if
he talces it with bmi, and thete is no one else but a stranger ,to entrust it wlth,
there is no sin on him in such c.i!,es. rn addition, he will not be liable for it in
case itis damaged.
Gener.illy. if the trustee is woi,ried about the trust, or if he wants to travel.
he has to render the ttust to Its c,wner or his deputy, If he does not find any
,of tl1e two, he is to take it with h:it?J ,on his journey if thi.s is the .safest way1If
not, he is to deliver it to the rule-r (or the one in authority) for the latter fs a
substitlite for the owner in his absence. If the trustee cannot entrust it with the
ruier (or the one in authority). he is lo entrust it with a trustworthy person.
To il.lustrate, when the Prophet (.PBUH) wanted lo immigrate to Mtdina, he
committed the trusts he had to Urnm Ayman (may Allah be pleased with l:ier).
and commanded ' Ali Ibn Abu Ia.Jib to return them to their owners'. Similarly,
if the trustee is dying, he has to render the trusts lo their owners, and lfhe doas
uot find them, he is to deliver the m lo tbe ruler (or the one in authority) or to
a trustworthy person,
Abusing a trust obligates ti\,~ truste~ to compensate for it fo case it is
damaged. For exampie. one maylbe entrusted with a riding animal hut rfde,
it unneces.-arily, entrusted with II garment but wears it for a purpose other
than preserving it.from clothes moth, or entrusted with some money in a coin
purse but takes the money out of it or unfastens the purse. In such cases. the
trustee is liable for compensation if the trust is damaged,. ~s he transgresses
others' property in so doing.

11l, SHARECROl'PlNc; AN I,) Rl':NTING

The trustee is supposed to be an honest anci trustworthy person, so tf he
says that he has rendered the trust 10 its owner or to someone on his behalf,
he is to be believed. Moreover, if the trustee daims thar the trust [s damaged
11~thout misusing it and he swears an oath, he is to be believed. This is because
n trustee is suppo~ed co be :3 trustworthy person, whose atidbute is derived
from "trust". Allah, ExaJ.t~d be He, says:

a·lnileed, A/lnh com,rinnds you to ret1dcr t rusts to wl,on, (laey
aredue..."
(Qur'An: An-Nisa': 58)

The original ruling is tfoat a tm~tee fs trusrworthy and innocent until
proven to be lying. On the til:her b~nd , if the trustee claims that the lm.~t is
damag~d due to an accident like fire, bis claim is not to be accepted until he
briogsc evidence that such lln accident bas bappenecl
Flnally. if tbe owner of th.e trust ask.~ tbe trustee to render it to him but the
tru~tee delay1, it for no exc115e until it 1s damaged, he Ts linble to compensate for
ii. because he has committed solllel'hing prohibi\ed, uamely withholding the
trust from its owner. And, Al lah knows best.

Reclamation of Wastelands

Faqihs' (may Allah have me1rcy on them) define a wasteland as a land
which is not reserved for utilities; or possessed by a legally protected owner.
This definition excludes two kinds oflands:

1- Private land: a land owned by a legally protected Muslim or disbeliever,
whether he bought it, took it as a gift, or the like.
2- P11blic land: a land reserved or specified for the benefit of private
properties, such as roads, yards, and watercourses, or reserved for
the utility of the residents such as cemeteries, garbage dumps, are.as
reserved for performing the prayers of the Two Feasts (·Ids), places
of firewood, and pastures. All such kinds of land cannot be legally
possessed by means of reclamation.
If the land which is not possessed by any legally protected owner is
reclaimed by someone, it belongs to him due to the following hadith narrated
by Jabir {may Allah be pleased with him) in which the Prophet (PBUH) said:

(authentic) b.mlit/0
Tl\ere are other lladith:, h;wing Ow same meaning: some of them are
recorded in ~abih AI-Bulcl,li:rl (Al-Buk/,uris Authelllic Book of Hadi't/1).
)IJt faqlhs agree that the wastcTa11ds can be possessed by those wbo

reclaim them, except the wi~telands of Al•Haram (the Sanctuary of Mecca)
and the area of ' Arafah (MOUJ1t}, so -as not to narrow the places specified for
the pilgrims to perform the rituals of 11.ajj or occupy n place specified for all
people. ffowever,faqihs diffor in determining the conditions requited to make
v-,ilid the reclamation of n bmrren or ownerle~s land.

A Wasteland ,an be Lc~ally Possessed in Some Ways
First: Wben a persons urrow1ds n wasteland with an invulnerable wall, 'it
becomes his, for the Prophet ("PBUH) said:
"if anyone surrounds a land (i.e. a wasteland) with a wall, r}ren it
belongs to Trim."'

(Related ,by Im~m Ahmad and Abii Dawiid on the authority of Jabir,
and lbnul-J4r0d deemed 1t a ~a!J.ih (authentic) flpdith)
There is another ll.adith narrited on the authority of Samurnh carrying
the same meaning, (itating that when a person surrounds a barren or
ownerless-land ,;,~th a wall, it becomes his, provided that such a wall is
strong and impregnable enough , However, if a person just put.~st.ones
or earth around a W~$tcland, or surrounds it with 11 low fence o.r a small
w-.iU fhat docs not prevent intruders, or digs a trench around ii, l he
land still does not bdon_g to him, yet he is more entitled to reclaim it'.
Moreover, it i6 impeKmissible for one to sell a wasteland unless one has
folly reclaimed it

Second: If a person d igs a well in a wasteland Until he reaches water,
then ii belongs to h im ·as he has reclaimed it However, if one digs a
well without getiing any water, the wasteland does not belong to hl'.m,
though he is still more entitled to reclaim. and own ft sincr he ba,s
started its reclarn.ation,

Ghopter I: Rtdnmollun,vfWostdm,J,

185

Third: If a person supplies a wasteland with water from a well or river,
he thus bas reclaimed it, as providing water is more useful to the land
tha11•surrounding it wllh n wall.

Fourth: If there is waler that overflows into a wasteland aod i;auses it
to be infertile, one.who prevents or drains such water ls consid¢red
to be reclaiming the wasteland, and thus it becomes his. 'T'his is
because this kind of reclamation is more useful to the land than
:surrounding it with a wall - which makes one owns-jt according to

the aforementioned b.atlllh.
Some sebolars maintain that there is no general rule to determine the cases
in which a wasrel.and is deemed reclaimed, and that a Muslim must adhere to
tne commo,i convention in this regard. What people conventionally consider
to be recl11marion of a waslela1ia entitles one wbo does it to possess the land.
This ls the opinion maintained by a group of the Hanbali scholars and others.
The Shari· ah (Islamic L'lw) states as a general mle that a wasteland is owned
by whoever reclaims it, without elaboratlon. So, a Muslim must refer- to the
common convention to find out what is deeined redamatioo and what is not
The (mam of Muslims (the ruler or the one in authority) is permitted r.o
grant the wasteland to whoever reclaims it, for the Prophet (PBUH) granted
the Valley of Al"• Aqiq (in Medina) to Bilal 1bnul-H~rith1 and a land i Q.
Hadramawt to Wail lbn Hujt'. The Prophet (PBUH) also granted fiefs. IQ
"Uma:r Ibnul-Khattab.' • Uthman lbn •Afron; and a groop oC Companions"
(may Allab be pleased with them all). Still, the one who·is granted a wasteland
as a fiefdoes not own it until he ceclaims it so as to become worthier than
others to possess it. Thus, if the one granted the wasteland reclaims it, then
it belongs to hlm. Yet, if he cannot, the Imam is permitted to re-take the
was.teland and grant it to someone cl~e able to reclaim it, for •Umar Ibnul,.
Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) took back the fiefs from those who
could not redaim them ' . Likewise, if one takes possession ofa game animal,
firewood or the like before others do, one becomes more entitled to possess
it, ptOvided that he gets it fitsL
If a natural watercourse. such as that ofa river or a valle.y; passes t.hrough
people's lands, it is permissible for·those by whose lands the water passes first
io Irrigate their hinds withholding water from others until JI gathers ancl its
height becomes equal to that of one's ankles. Then, they should allow it to flow
to those next to them, and so on ;md so forth. 'Ibe !'rophet (PBUH) said to

found ,0111 t/iat the height fmeam "in rhe hadtth) equals rhcir of out's

'Thus, they measured the amount of water described in the hadith and
found out that it was as high as the ankles; then they made this amount a
measurement to determine ,the t~rget amount of water after which everyone
should allow water to llow to his neighbors to irrigate from it successively.

Job Wages Ua 'alah)
According to the Shari' ah (Islamic Law), job wages refer to the wage given
to someone for some help or work he does. In other words, they refer to the fixed
amount of money given by someone to another for the latter's performance of
a certain task. such as erecting a wall.
The permissibility of job wages is demonstrated in the Qur';ln; Allah,
Exalted be He, states in the Qur'an that Yusuf (Joseph) said:

•~ ..and for he who produces it is [the nward of} a camel's load,
(Qur'an: Yusuf: 72)
and 1am responsible for it."
The meaning is that whoever reports about the thief who has stolen the
measure of the king will get a camel's load as a job wage. Thus, the aforesaid
Qur'anic verse implies the permissibility of giving wages. Its permissibility is also
stated in the Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition) through the b.adlth about the stung
person narrated on the authority of Abu Sa· id in the Two ~ahih.s ' and in other
books of Hadlth. Abu Sa· id Al-Khudri (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated:

IY RE.CLAMA'I'! ON 01 1 WASTJi;LANDS ANO.•..

"Snme of the Prophetl; Companions went on a journey until they
reached some of the Amii tTJlies (at 11ightJ, They asked the latter to
treat them as their gu,ests but they refused, The chief of that tribe
was then bitten b.y a rnake (or stung by a sc01pion) and they (liis
people) tried their bes:t to cure him /mt in vain. They went to the
group ofthe Comp11ni,111s and asked whether they had a treatment
or not. One of tliem n ip /led, '}'es, by Allah! I ca,, recite a religiotis
il'!(antation for cure (ruqyah), but as you have refused to accept
IIS as )'Our g11ests, I wNI nor recite the religious incantation for yo11
unless you fix for us swne wages for it.' They agreed to P"Y them a
flock of sl1ee,p, so he (1!h11t Companion) went with them and kepi
Ii/owing und reciting the Sura ofAI-Fatihah (the Opening Chapter
oftf,q Qur'cln) over the shmg man who•bec,11rie all righi as ifhe was
relenscdfrom a chain (i.e. showing no signs of sickness). Thue11po11,
they paid them (the Compa11io11s) ,t/ie wage they agreed.to pay. After
that, they (tlte Comp,a11io11s) mnre to the Prophet (PBUH) and
narrated the whole :nary ro him, upori which he (PBUH} said, 'You
have done the. right thing. Divide it (the wage) among yourselves
and assign n sharefor 111e as well.' ,,.
lf the person pefforms the work for whfd1 a certain wage is specified, then
he deserves it, for t be agreement1s validated by the per,fbrmance ofthe ~pedfied
Jask. If a group of workers performs the task, the wage is to be equally dlvideci
among them, fo.r they participate In performing lhe same job for which die
specified wa.ge is paid, Whoever works when no wage is stipulated does not
deserve anjitlring, as-it is considered a task performed withouMhe permlsslon
of the employer, and thus t he worker does not deserve any wage or reward.
However, if the wage is stipulated after he has started the ',"Ork, the worl<er
deserves only the appropriate amounLof the w;ige ;i~cording to the wc,rlcdone
after !he stipulation-of the wage.
Giving wages to a worlker is a permissible agreement. Therefore, both
parties, the worker and the employer. are entitled to cancel it. !f the 'Worker
cancels the agreement, he deserves no wage or reward, for he thus drops his
own right. However. if the ,employer cancels l;i)e agreement after ffie worker
starts, the worker deserves an ~ppropriale portion· of the wage nccording to
what he has already perfomied, for which compensation is due. Giving wages
(}11' a/alt) is different from '.hiring people's services (ijarah) in some. aspects.
among them are the followiing:

191

• lnjob wages, it is not a pi:ereqtiisite for the validity of the agreement
to spedfy accuraiely the rask for the worker to perfo,m in return fat
the wage. Y~t. specifyu,g; the service is a condition for the validity of
biting ( ijlirah) .
• lt ls· not a condition for·thc? validity of wages to specify a certa-in period
for the task to be done !in retur.n for the w~ge, unlike hiring whose
validity stipulates that th,e period of work must be specified.
• fl ,s permissible in job wages ro stiptilate ooth the task and the period
during whicb. lhls task iS, to be performed. For example, one CIID say,
"Whoever sews this garment for me in one day deserves such and suc'b
as,wages". In such a case, if the worker sews the garment 'In one day, he
deserves the specified wa,ge; otherwise, he deserves nothing. However,
in hiring, il is impermissible for the ~mployer to stipulate both the
service and the time during which. n is to be done (i.e. the worker
receives his wages once he pe,rforms his work),
• In case ofjob wages, one is not obliged tu perform the task, bui in tiirinS,
the hired person is oblig,:d to perform the service.
• [t is not a condition fot 1:he validity of giving job wages tQ specify a
certain person 10 perform the said task. However, in hiring, specifying
the worker is a condition, for its validity.
• Giving wages is a permiss.ible agreement which each of the two patties
'-10 cancel without the p•crmission of the other. Yet, hiring a person's
s.ervice is a binding agreement thar neither of the parties can ca~cel
unless the other agrees.
•

Paqlhs maintain that whoever performs a task foranother wilhout stipulating
a wage or taking the employer's permission d~serves notlimg as wages. This
is because he thus performs a r1ask without stipulating compensation, so he
deserves nothing 1n compensati•) n, and he cannot enjoin the employer to do
something t he latter is not oblig;ed to do. However, there are two e.,cceptions
11\ this case;

First: .if a worker, such as a broker, a porter or the like, has prepaTed
himself to. do a certain service for a cert:iin reward or wage, When
he performs ihe job, p1·ovided he has already taken the emplqyer·~
per:mission, he deserve!; the ,:pecified wag~ as it is a convention:!1
practice. Yet, he who ha,s not already prepared himself to do the 6aid
servi~e deserves nuthin,g as a rew!lrd or wage, even if he has been
permitted 10 do it, unlesS'there has be,:,n n pervious condition.

IV RECf,,AMJ\'J'ION OF WASTELANDS AND-

192

Second: 1I s omeone rescues another's property from damage or
destruction, the former deserves an appropriate wage for this sewice,
even if the owner has not gjven him permi&Sion to do it, This may
happen in cases such as rescuing one's property from sinking ln the
-sea, saving it from fire, or protecting it from imminent danger. Such
a rescuer deserves an apptopriat·e wa~. as he is concerned about
others' properties and keer, on saving them from damage. Therefore.
jiving him a wage here urge.~ him, as well as others, to maintain such
a good dttd, namely rescuing others' properties fmm damage and

destruction.
Shaykhu.i-Isllm lbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

"Whoever rescues anotlter~ property from destmction and returns
it safe (to the gwner) aeserves an appropriate wage, even if there is
110 previous stipulatfon, acconling to /he prepondemnt of the two
opinions in this regard, llS well as the opinfon ttta111/ai11ed by lm,lm
Ahmad and o/her ccmpiler.s •ofHad/ti,."
Moreover, the great Imlbn lbnul-Qayyim (may Alla}i have merer bn
him) said:

"!fa per$on dC}fls somelhing in Javor ofsomeohe~ property fvithoul the
owners permfssfon to endear himselfto t/ie ()Wner ofthe property. or if
he does it to protect the latter's property and to presttve itfrom damag~
or loss, it is permissible for him, tlte rescue,:, to ask for a compensatory
wage for his service; this is the opinion maintained also by Imam
AJirrllld orr mw,y occasio11s."

Finding Lost Objects (Luqatah)

Luqatah refers to any lost property, excluding animals, found by someone.
Islam, the True Religion, enjoins the protection, safekeeping, and taking care
of one's fellow Muslims' properties, even in case oflost-and-found properties. .
A lost property is surely one of the following three kinds:

1- An insignificant object! A lost property can be an article that people
do not usually care about, such as a whip, a loaf of bread, a fruit, a stick and the
like. If someone finds such a lost object, it is permissible for him to take it and
make use of it at once without advertising having found it. To illustrate, Jabir
(may Allah be pleased with him) narrated:

"The Messenger ofAllah (PBUH) gave us permission concerning
sticks, ropes, whips, or suchlike things, which a man of us may
(accidentally) find, that one may benefit from them.'''
(Related by Abu Dawud)

194

lV RliCL-\MATION OF \VASTF.LANDS AND-.

2- Animals safe from small predators: The second kind of lost
properties is animal& that can defend themselves against small wild beasts by·
means of their big size such as camels, horses, cows, or mules, or by means of
flying s uch as birds, or by means of running fast such as antelopes, or by using
their canme· teeth such as cheetahs. It is prohibited to pi~ 1,1p s1,1q1 kinds of
iost animals and !alee them on the pretext that they are lost properties; such
animals cannot be possessed when found, even if the finder advertises having
found LI-tern. When the man who found a lostc:amel asked the Prophet (PBUH)
wllat to do, he (PBUH) replied:
«Jt is 11one of your concern. 11 has its feet and it$ water cohtainer
(reservoir); it can go on drinking water and euting (leaves ojJ trees
until its ownerfinds it."'

(Related by Al-'Bukh~ri and Muslim)
Moreover, 'Umar Jbnul-KhanAb (may Allah be pleased with him) said:

"Wllo«ver takes a lost animal (Illa/ he finds) is considered to lrnve
,,,.
gol!e astray.
Accordlng to the aforen,1entioned [!11di1/r, th~ Prophet {PBUH) enjoin&
Mui;lirns to leave such a lo~t animal alone 10 reach water, and eat (the- leaves)
of trees until its owner finds it. The same ruling applies to big objects and tools
sud i a.s large pots, woode1; articles, iron artic;les, and all such large things that
cart hardly be lost or moved, from their place.~. Pkking up such large objects
and taking them as lost properties is prohibited; it ls even rpore entitled to be
prohibited than the aforesaid kind of lost animals.

3- Money, belongings, and animals menaced by-small predatorsi
The third kind of lost attides is properties such as money, belongings, and
animals that cannot defend thtmselves against small wild beasts, such as sheep,
,weaned camels, and calves. It is permissible for the person who is confident of
his own trushMrthiness to •pick up and keep such kinds of lost articles, which
fall under three categories:

A) Lawfully edible animals (such as weaned cameis, ewes, and
hens): lf a person finds sucb a lost animai, he is permitted to use it in
.one of the following three ways that benefits ,its original owner most:

1- He can eat it and (bus owes its price to Its owner.
2• ffe can sell it and keep its price to give it to its owner when b e
appears and the finder is certain that he is the real owner.

C~pti:r 3 : Findlng-1..o.sr Objccu (l11q411ah)

195

3. He can keep it, without possessing it, provide it With food and ,the
like ar bis 9wn expense, and then get back what he has spent from
its owner when he appea1ts to reclaim it. When the Prophet (PBUH)
was asked about the ruling on finding a lost and ownerless ewe, he
{PBUH) replied:

"Take it,Jor it is eit/,erfor·you. for your brother (i.e. for cmotherfellow
who may find it), or fol' t>.1e wolf'
(Related by Al~Bukhart a11d Muslim)
This !iadith means that t:he lost, ownerless ewe was weak ·and liable.
IO-perish, So, it would be better to be taken by the wan who found it,
for if he would 11ot take i( someone else would do; otherwise the wolf
would ,eat it. Commenting on this badilh, Ibnul,Qayyim said:

"This fiadfth impli~s the 11ermiss/bility of picking liJI and taking a lost
shtep, and that if the owner of a lost ewe does not come lo claim it, it
w/lJ belong to the 011t who has found it. Thu$, he can eat it and owe
its price to its owner, or :;ell ii and keep its price to give to /ts c:>wner
when he appears, or keep ii and feed it at his own expense. Scholars
unanimously agree that Ms owner ha; tl-1e right to take it back if he
comes before it is eaten b)! the one who has found,it."

B) Peri,shables: When the !found objecl is liable ,to become rotten, $Uch
as watermelon and fruit. one who finds it shouJddo what best benefits
the owner; the tinder can eatit and pay its price lo the owner, or sell it
and keep its price to give to the owner when he meets him.

C) All kinds of properties excluding A and B (such as money and
utensils)i If one finds .sue!\ a lost artic!'e, one must keep it with liimas a
trust and advertise having foood it. However, no one is permitted to pickup
any, 1951 article and keep it unless he is confident of his own trustworthiness,
and able to define its description when necessary. 1'0 ilh,istrate, Zayd Ibo
Khalid Al-1uhant (may All1ab be pleased with him) narrared:

';\ man asked the Prup/ret (PBUH) about the rnling on fi11ding lo.ii
gold or silver (~e- mo11~y) and he (PBUH) replied, 'Remember the
description of irs comalncir (i.e. the purse or the like) and the string ids
.tied with, a.nd make publ.ic a1111ou11cem,mt abourit for one year T/ie11,

give it to him,' The,~ lhe 11um asked'him about the ruling on finding a
lost sheep, he (/>BUH) replied, 'Take it.for it is eithe,·for you.for your
brother (f,e. for another fellow who may find it), orfor the wo/f: After
tl1at, he (PBUH) was asked 11bo11t the ruling on finding a lost camel,
and he teplied, 'Jt is none ofyour concern. It has its feet and its water
tontainet (reservoir); it c1111 go 011 drinking water and eating (leaves
ofJ trees until its ownetfind$ it.' •
(Related by Af-Bukbari/.md Muslim)

By saying, : .. make public am101mce,nent (about it) for olle year...~,
the Prophet (PBUH) wants the person who picks up such a Josi
proper.ty (gold or silv~r; money) io announce the description of the
lost article wherever people assemble such as marketplaces, in front
of mosques, and in meetings and gatherings. for one year, During the
first week, such a person Is required to make public announcement
abour the lost article everyday, as it is more li~ely !hat its owner will
be searching for it to claim ii during the first week After this.week is
over, the finder ls fo follow the common con\!ention in his making
a public announcement about lt. The aforesaid l!adith indicates the
obligation of making a public announcement about fil\ding a Jost
article. 'rhe Prophet's words, "Remember the description ofits co11tairrer
( le. /he purse or the like) and the string it ;5 tied with," indica.te th.at if
is obligatory upon the finder lo know the description of the found
object. Thus, when its owner comes and describes it correctly, it must
be given back to him. l-fowever, if a person gives a false description of
a lost article, lt is impecmissible 10 give it to him. When rbe Prnphet
(PBUH) said. ''. ., Then, if no one identifies it, you ,c,;m utilize II," this
implies that after one year, the lost article belongs to the finder, after
making the· necessary public announcement about having found it,
However, the rmder should not make use of it unless he knows its
description: lts container (or pnrse), tying material, amount, kind,
and such dlstinctive descriptions. If ii$ owner ,comes after one- year
and describes it cortecrly, ii must be given back to him as the Prophet
(•PBUH) said, ~,. and if its owner shows up (to reclaim It) at any time
afterwards, gille it lo him.• Io the light of the above, rhe rulings on
Onding l<1Stobjem ~an ,be summai'1zed as-follows:
First: If a person finds a lost object, he is not permitted to pick it
up and keep it unless he is confident of his own trustworthiness, and
.-hie to .aqnounce having found it public!)' so ~s to find its owner.

C'Ji•prer 3: faoding Lo« Objacc< (L11fja,~1/,)

J97

Accordii1gly, if one does 1:iot trust oneself to take tbe proper measures'
fodhe found object, it is impermissible forone'to pick up and keep it;
if one does, one ls legally- considered a usurper for subjecting otl1ers'
properties to loss.

Second: Before taking a k1st article, lts finder must know its containeJ,
tying material, amount, kind; and such descriptions as enjoined by
the Prophet (PB!JR) in ,tlhe aforementioned b.adith, and the Prophet's
commands indicate obligation. The word '"container'' includes any
envelope, purse, bag, piece of cloth, or the like, in w11lch the found
obje.:t is wr-~pped and tied,

Third: It ls obligatory ttpon the pe1-son who picks up a lost article
to :make public announcement abo!ll it for one year. During the
first week, such a per.;on. is required lo make public annouqcements
about it everyday, and then be is to follow the common convention
in his making public announcement about it, He can say in bis
public announcements s,omething !ike, "ffas anyone lost anything?':
or anything of the kind. Such an announcement should be made in
places where people ass:emble; such as marketplaees and in front
of mosques after performing congregational prayers. However, It i~
prohibited to tnake such un announcement (of findrng a lost object)
inside the mosque, for mosques are not built for that. The Prophet
(PSUH) said:

'1fanyone bears a 111a11 in tl,c mosque asking about something T1(!-./i0$
lost, he shpuld say to }riim. 'May Allah not restore it to you,' for the
mosques are not built for that.""

Foulith: If the claimaTitl of a fost article. de.scribes it correctly, it
is obligatory upon the finder to give it to him without asking for
any more proof or an e>ath as enjoined by the Prophet (PBUH).
Moreover,aclai.mantscorrectdescriptfonofalostarticlesubstitutes
any further proof or oath. R:ithec; his correct description is more
reliable and credible than a proof or ur, o~ll,. Also, the finder of a
lostarticle must give ba1:.k forts owner any tli rect or i11d1rll(:t profits
he obtained through tlie article. However, if the claimant cannot
give the right: description of the article, lt must not be given to him
!1S it is considered a trui.t in the custody of the finder. Therefore, ii
is impermissible forthe: finder to give the article to someone wbo
cannot prove that he is its owner;

198

lfV RECLAMATION OF WASTEU.NDS AND ...

Fifth: if the owner (If the lost article does not come 10 claim il during
the one year of the public announcement.made by the finder, it,becomes
the latter's. However, before using the article 1n any way, the finder
must know its description well. so that wnenever its owner shows up
and identifies it the finder can give it back to him or compensate him
for it if it is not these, This is because the ownership of a finder of a lost
article is a temporary one whkh becomes void once the real ,owner
appears and claims iL

Sixth; Scholars differ regarding 1he ruling on picking u_p a lost object
within Al-Haram (the Sanctuaty of Mecca), They differ regarding
whether the lost objec.t fopnd !here belongs to the finder after making
public aru\Oimcemenrs about ii for one year. or whether it ,~oes not
belong to him at all Some scholars are of the opinion that the lost
object found within Al-Hoom takes the snme rullhg on other lost
objects fouJJd elsewhere due to the generalization of tile h.adlt/1s in
this regard. l:fowever, other scltolars maintain that it is impermissible
to possess a lost article found rhere, and that it is obligatory to make
public announcement aboul it forever, as the Prophet (PBU!-1) said
about Al-Haram:·

: ..it is not allowed to pick up itsfaUm things (i.e. the lost obfectsformd
there) except by a person who will look ft,r its owner- (by announcing
havingfound it public/yr'
This is nlso the opinion maintained by Shaylchul-lslAm lbn 'nlymiyah
(may Allah hnve rpercy on him) who said:

'"1'he lost article within Al-Haram oan II ever be ow11eq. b)' the one who picks
ft up, and it Is obligatory to make public a11nouncement about it foreve,:"

This opinion is implied in the aforementioned /iadith that prohibits
picking up a lost article fo11nd within Al-Haram,

Seventh: if someone leaves an animal in a desert due Lo its inability to
walk or his inability to l<eep ii. it will belong lo the one who find~ and
takes it The Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Tf anyonefinds a11 a11i111al whose owners could 11ot tefford It an(.{ so they
have released it. and then he (tlte finder) takes ii, ii will belong to him:••
This is because the owner of suclt an animal reieased it out of iack of
jntere~t in it, so it has the same rulings on things whose ownei,s get rid
of due to lack of interest.

Ch:ip,er 3: Finding Lo" Objecr.s (Luqal/lh)

When someone loses his-pair of shoes, or any of his belongings, and
finds a different one instead in the same place, ii is considered a lns1
article that does not belong fo liim. Being found in the sam.e place ot
similar to his lost item dpes not make it his. Rather; he is obliged to
advertise having found it for one ycar;and then he is permitted to take
only what is worth his lost one and then gjve the rest ill charicy- on
behalf of its owner.

E_\ghth: if a child or -a foolish person takes a 1Mt article, his gµardian
must take it and make a public announcement about having it. This
is because a child or a foolish person is not legally qualified to keep
tr1.1St~. If the guardian leaves the lost article to the child or the foolish
person, and it ts damaged, he becomes finllJlcfolly liable for it, as
be is the one to be blamed fut its damage, If the guardian makes a
public announcement about the lost article (for one year) and no one
identifies it, t,hen it belongs to the child or the foolish person in his
custody (as is the case of any grown up or sane person).

Ninth: i(a person picks upa lost article from-a place and then he places
it again in the same place.he becomes legally liable for it, as it becomes a
trust in his custody that must be kepl like other trusts, whereas leaving
it may caus~ it robe lost. In fact, fhe Islamic legal rulings concerning losl
and found properties show how !slam takes greal interest in Musli'ms'
properties and how it is lceen on protecting and' safeguarding them,
'Fhis, in ,general, indicates.that Islam urges Muslims. to coopecate in
righteousness and good. We pray lo Allah, Glorified and .Exalted be He,
to make us firm tn Ts lam and let·us die u Muslims.

The rulings on lost babies and those on lost objects are highly related.
This indicates the comprehensiveness of Islamic rulings in meeting all the
" 'orldly requirements as Islam always pioneers every vital and useful field. The
services rendered through the Islamic teachings surpass the contemporary
services of nurseries, orphanages, and such places that provide for orphans
and disabled children who do not have supporters. Among the unprecedented
noble teachings of Islam is its care and interest in foundlings.
A foundling is a baby deserted or abandoned by his parents or who is lost
from them, and whose parentage is unknown in both cases. If a Muslim finds a
foundling, he/she has to take him, support and provide lodging for him, as it is
a collective duty' upon the Muslim community; if done by some Muslims there
will be no sin upon the rest. Yet, it will be a sin upon the Muslim community
if all of them leave foundlings homeless and helpless while they are able to
support them. Allah, Exalted be He, says:

IV RECLAMATION OF WASTELANDS AND...
"... and cooperate in rlghteousm,ss 411d piety.. ."
(Qur'!\n: Al-Ma'iidah: 2)

The generality of the verse indicates the obligation upon Muslims to take
lo~~ babies and l9okafter them, as it is considered cooperat1on in righteousnes8
and piety. Topick up a foundling is ameansofsavingbis life,so it isas o.bligatory
•
as feeding someone starving or rescuing someone drowning,
J\ Jost child is considered .a free human being in ail cases, as freedom is
tl1e main ruling and slavery is the exeeption. So, when there is ne, proof of
slavery, the child is.considered a free one. On the othet hand, whatever money·
fotind with the foundling or near him is regarded as his, as :it is fmmd in his
possession. T·he finder of the foundling is to use such money lo spending on
him according to what is acceptable, as he becomes his guatdi.an. However,
lf lhe foundling h.as nothing with him to be L.sed for spending on him, the
guardian is p~mitted to get financial aid from the Muslims' Public Treasury
for tliat purpose. •Umar lbnul • Kli'a!l:ab (may Allah be plea&ed with him), when
he was a nrler, said W the finder of a foundling:

"Go, He (the fo1111d /jaby} is free; yo11 have become his g11ardian,
and we are liable for his expenditµre$.•'
By saying so, ' Umar meant !hat the ftnder 11rould take money from the
Public'rreasury of Muslims to spend on the foundling.he picked up. According
to another narration, • Umar sald to the man, ''.. ,and we are 'liable for his
breastfeeding," ' i.e. the Muslims' Public TreasLliy would be responsible for
tl1e. breastfeeding of the foundling baby. Thus, it is not obligatory 1,1pon the
finder of a lost baby to affo1d his/her breastfeeding or any other expenditure,
but it is an obligation upon the Muslims' Public Treasury instead Yet, if the
Public Treasur,y of Muslims is unable to afford his/her expenditure, it becomes
obligatory upon those Muslims who know about this baby to afford his/her
e>.1>enditu1e. for Allah says:
'! ..a,.d cooperate in rlgl,reoustti:M and piety..."

(Qur'an: Al-MA'idab: 2)
In addition., leaving a foundling may lead to his death, but taking liim and
spending O!l him ls a kind of hospitality like that shown to guests. As regards
o foundling's religion, if he is found in an Islamic ,stale or in a non-Islamic
state where. a lot of Musllms live, he. is cunslde~ed a Muslim. for llie Prophet
{PBUR) said:

"£,,ery newborn is born wi,h FiJralt (the True Religion of [slam)." '

Cluprcr ~: Pouodlings

Yet, if the lost child is fol.llld in a non-Islamic country wbere none or few
Muslims ilve, he ls considered a disbeliever like 1he people -of his country.
In this case, his finder becomei, hi~ guardian if he 1s a trustworthy pecson.
When ' Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) knew that AbO Janiilah was a
righteous man, he approved of ~jm as a guardian of the foundling and said to
hl111, "You have /:>ecome his guardian.~' Since Abu Jarntlah was the first one to
take this lost child, he became r.oore entitled to be his gtJ.1rdian. Concerping
any money found with the losr baby, the f'.1J1der must ~pend ft 011 thi's baby
according to what i~ ac..:eptable, as he has become bis guardian. A guardian of
a Muslim foundling Cllf\DOt l:ie d.efiant\y disobedient tu Allah or a disbeliever,
for it is prohibited to make a ddiantly disobedient or a disbeliever guardian
6f any Muslim lest he should persecute him or make him stray from Islam.
Likewise, a Bedouin, who mov-es from place to place, cannot be approved
of as a guardian of a Jost 'baby, as he may exhaust hlm/he-t. In this case, tne
baby is to I?~ u lt.ell from the B,edouin and be g'iveri to one of 1he residents.
This is because staying in an ud:ian area is better for the foundllng for both
his religious and worldly mattel s. Beside.s. it gives him/her a better chance of
finding his/her lost family.
When the foundling grows up, and then dies 6r is kllled, his inheritanee
or his blood n'•oney (diyah) will belong to the Public Treasury of Muslims, as
/ong as he has no children to iilhetil from him. Yet, ifhe has a wife, she get~ one
fourth of the inheritance. lf-an heirless foU!'ldling is premeditatedly kilieq, the
lmfun of Muslims (the ruler or the one in ;iuthority) is legally considered his
guardian. This is because an heirless foundling is inherited by ail Muslims, whose
representative is the Imam. Accordingly, when a foundling is premeditatedly
)<\l)ed, the Im~m has the right lo choose either retaliation or blood money that
will be kept in the Public Treasury; as the Imam of Muslims is deemed a legal
.guardian ofany Muslim.who has .no guardian. On the other haJ).d, ifa foundling
iS intentionally assaulted and in}ure\f, he must be·left urttil he reaches the age
of puberty to decide wbether to Jretallate or pardon.the criminal (who assaulted
him). lf a man or a womon claims the lost cllild to be his or hers, the cbJ.ld
must be. re.turned to him OF her, as long as t here are. no other claimants. 'T'hls is
because it i.s for the foundling's own good to Rnow his parentage and reJoin his
family, and there will be rto harm to. others in thaf. However, ifwffererit persons
cl= the lost chlld to be thein, he ·is'to be given ro whoeverproducesthe proof
ofh1-s true claim. lf no one bas a proof. o r if they produce contradictory p~o<:>fs,
the de.clsion.must be taken by tlbe genealogists. To illostrate, in a similar case,

Endow1ment ( Waqf)

In Shari· ah (Islamic Law), en,dowment ( waqf) refers to the retention of any
property that can be benefited from. by suspending disposal of it and dedicating
its revenues to public use as an act of charity. Houses, shops, gardens, and
the like, can be examples of property endowment, whose benefits (such as
fruits, rents, and lodging) can be, given in charity. Endowment is desirable in
Islam, and ii is considered a piou,s act that brings man near to Allah, as proved
through the authentic Sunnah (Prophetic 1radition). To illustrate, it is stated
in the Two :iab.ibs that •Umar ( may Allah be pleased with him) said to the
Prophet (PBUH):

"O Messenger of Allah! T /!iave a land in Khaybar which I prize
highly, so what do you ord,?r me to do with it?" The Prophet said,
"Ifyou like, you can give the land as endowment and give its fruitl
in charity." Thereupon, 'Umar gave it in charity (as an endowment

given cis a present, nor bequeathed. He e111wweJ it for the poor; for
his kith pnd kin, for emancipation ofslaves, for the C4use of Allali,
for travelers andfor guests'.
Imam Muslim also related in his Sah.ib. (Authentic Book ofl:iad1th) that the
Prophet (PBUH) said:
"When a human being dies, his .deeds ·c ome to an end except fqr
three deeds (whose rewards are everlasting): ongoing charil)/,
knowledge benefited from (by others), or a pi= son who prays
for him.»2
Jibir (may Allah be pleased with him) said:
'½II the rich of the Prophet's Companions gave endowments.''
Al-Qwtubi ( may Allah have mercy on him) said:
"There is no disagreement amo11g the faqihs on the pennissibility
of endowing barrages 11nd mosques. Yet, they differ about other
properties."
The donor of an endow1'1}ent must be legaUy qualified to manage.his own
property. Thi$. means that s/he must be a free, adult, ancl s;ine person, Thus,
<1 child, a foolish or weak-minded person, or a slave ls uot legally qualified to
grant an endowmenL

An Endowment is Established through
Either of the Following Two Ways
1. Verbal Indication of endowment, such as saying, "I endow ,this
place," or saying, "! endow this place to be used as a mosque:•
2.Actions that indicateendowmentaccordingtocommon convention,
snch as turning ones house into a mosque and giving permission for
people to perform prayer therein, or turning one's land into a cemetery
and permitting people to bury dead persous therein,
A Verbal Statement of an Enaowment Is of Two Kinds
1. Dlrectstateme1ttl such as.-aying, "I endowed such. and such property,"
or saying, "I grant sud1 ;md sud! property as an endowment in the

Cruiprcr 5: Endow,ucm ( IY4s,if)

Cause of .Allah~ .\nd ihe like. These are direct statements thaJ MVe
only the meaning of gr.mlting endowme.nts. When a donor just utters
S\!Ch words, his endowmimt be.comes valid (if it meets the necessary
conditions), and he does n.o t need to say any other for1t1ulas to confirm
the endowment.
2. Metonymy: here it mea.ns saying metonymic word~ that can have
meanings other than endlowmeni, such as saying, "I give such and
s11c11 property in charity,~ "] grant such and such property to be used
fol'eYer; <lt the like. When a donor uses s\Jch metonymic words., he·
mu.st !iave the intention of granting an endowment, or use some dir-ecf
statements side by side with such metooymic words 10 clarify them.

Conditions for the Vatidiqr of Establishing an Endowment
! - The donoi• must be legall:Yqualified to manage his own property, as
met1tio11ed above.
2- The endowed object 1nust be an identified article which is const.1ntJy
utilliable and non-consumable, u1ilike food and the like.
3- The end'owed object must be speqfied. It is invalid tc, grant
u.nspecjped enqowment:;; It is invalid, for example, to say; "I endow
one of my slaves:' or sayiing, ''l endow one of n1y houses:· without
specifying it.
4- l'he end(fvlment must be for something beueficial, for it is a mean~
of gettfng nearer to AUah. such as mosques, l;,arrage» measuring
b()wls, houses, books of ~iseflll knowledge, etc. Another e.xrunple'. of
endowments for righteous use. is endowing something to suppor\
kith and kin. Accordingly; an endowment is invalid to be ,uade for
temples of the disbelieve rs, for books of disbelief and atheism, or
for lightingorincensing 5;Juines or providing food md water for the
custodians of certain gra·vcs. This is because such endowment~ are
regarded as means of ass·isting 9thers in d"tsobedience, poiytheism,
1lild disbelief.
5- If the endowment ls made for a certain person, that person must be one
whose owpership is lt:gally conside.red valid, because an endowment
is a kind of ownership th,;,t is not valid for those who cannot possess
properties, such as a dead or an an1m~l.

208

JV RECLAMATION OF WASTELANDS AND..•

6- An endowment must be fulfilled onre jt is made; it ii invalid to be
temporary or suspended ~xcept in case it is a condition for jt to be
given on the dona.r's death. For example, it ls valid fora donoc ofan
Bndowment to say, "When [ die, my house will be an ,endowment
for the poor," To iijustrate, Abu Dawod related tllat ' Umar lhnulKhattab (may Allah be pleased wifu him) determined in his
will that after his death, land of his calkil Thamgh would be an
endowment for charity' . Since this traditiop· was well known and
no scholar disapprov~d of it, it is considered coµsensus , Thus, ifan
endowment is made conditional on the donor's death, it must be
given from only one third of his property, as endowments take the
same ruling on bequests.
tt fs obligatory to fulfill the condition of the donor of the endowment as
iong-as it doe~ not violate Shar'f' a/1, for the Prophet {PBUH) said:

"Muslims mll$t keep to t/1e conditions they make, except for a condition that makes somet'1ingprofribitcd lawful or something lmvful
prohibited."'
Bes.ides, ' Um.ar Ibnul-Kha11ab lmay Allah be pl~scd with hiln) made
a condition when he granted an endowment, and if it were not obligatory
to be fulfilled, it would be of no LJSe to make it Therefore, the donor of an
·endowment can make conditions concerning the amount of the endowment,
the priority order ofthe beneficiaries, the presence or the lack ofcertain quality
(or qualities) of the beneficiaries, the guardianship of the endowment, and so
on. That is to say; the condition made b)' the donor must be fulfilled unless it
violates the Qur'an or the Swmah (Prophetic Tradition). However, if the donor
stipulates nothing, those to whom the endowment is donated will be equal;
there will be no difference between the rich and'the poor ot between the males
and the females among them.
If no guardian is stipulated by the donor to take care of the endowment,
or if t1ie appointed guardian dies, the endowmenr must be supervised by
those to whom the endowment is <lon~ted if they are specified persons. 1f
the endowment is granted' 10 an association like a mosqoe, or fur unspecified
_people or unlilnited number of people such as the needy or the poor in general,
the authorities are responsi.ble to take care of the endowment or, at lea~!, to
appoint someone. to do so,

Clupcer 5t EMowmcnt ( Waef'J

209

Generally, the guardian of an endowment must feaf Altah and take good
care of the endowment. for ii is considered a trust in his liability.
If the donor makes an endowment for hls chlldren, male and female
children will be equal, as he has made'lhem equal partners in his endowme.nt.
Since there is no specific division stipulated by the donor, all h1s children
will have equal share in it, jost like the case when one grnuts something to
his children; it is equally divided among thern. After the death of the donor's
children, the endowment is to be giVen to the children of his sons, not those
of his daughlets. This is because daughters' children belong to other men
(their fathers} whose names are given to them,-and thus those chilcfren are not
Included in the Qur'anic verse that states:

"Alla/, instructsyou concendngyourdtildren [i,e, their portums

(Qur'an: An-Nist:, 11)
However, some scholars 111aintain thar 'your children" in the aforesaid
verse also include daughters' children, as one's daughters are one's children.
and their children are the children of one's children. And, Allah knows best.
ff the donor says,"! m ake this endowment for my sons, or for the sons of
so and so, then theendowmenl will belong only to the sons, not the daughters,
for the w9rd sons" refers to the male.children not to the female or1es. Allah,
Exalted be He, shows such 4lstinction when He says:

"Or has Re pa,1ghten w~ile you have soris?n
( Qur'an: A1-Iur: 39,l
However; if the donor specifies that he makes the endowment for a certain
tribe, such as Banu Hashim (i.e. sons of the tribe o f Hashim) or Banc. T~mim
(),e. sons of the tribe ofTamim), theendow1nen1 will belong to both the sons
and the daughters of the specified tribe. This ls because the title "Banti" of an
Arab triberefets to both the sons and daughters of the tribe, l:hougb "BanO''
means sons.
lf the donoc makes an endowment for a lirnited l,'rollp of people whose
members tan be specified, eac.l\· of them must have· an equal share, buf if
It is for a group whose rnernoers cannot be specified or lln]ited, ii is not
obligatory to divide it among 1hcm, as it will be impossible then. R,ath~r. it is
permissible lo make the endowment resttfcted lo some of,t hem, accordittg

considered an eternal contract. Moreover, an endowment can neither be
sold nor transferred from its place unless its benefits completely vanish. For
l!Xaniple, when the endowed h(luse collapses and the profit it makes cannol
afford its re;pair, or when the endowed agticultural land becomes infertile
and JI!, yield cannot afford its reclamation, il is permissible in such cases to
sell the endowed object and use its price to get its like, for this best serves the
objeciive of its granter. However, if the value of t he sold endowed property
cannot afford an equal substitute, the price is to be spent to get a similar one
even if ofless value. Thus, the new property will be regarded as a11 endowment once .ii ·is bought
If the endowed property is a mosque th.11 i.s no longer in use .-s il is
drunaged or the like, it is to be sold and its price m ust be spent on gettfog

on anotlier mosque, for this Serves aod complies With the main purpose of
the. endoWmenl. Similarly!It is permissible to give charity to ,1he needy from

lf the cionor designates a particular person ns the endowmenl beneficiary;
and specifies a certain amount of money of the endowment pc9fit to be

T11qfyyud-Dln (may Allah hlille mercy on him) said jn this regard:

''Ifthe procee,i.1 of the.endowment are always more than eno11gh,

Gift anci Donation
The gift refers to a donation of a specific amount of property given by a
person legally qualified to manage his own property. The Prophet (PBUH)
used to give and accept gifts. Thus, giving or accepting a gift is a recommended
act of the Surmah (Prophetic Tradition) due to its consequent virtues. The
Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Give presents to one another to gain the love of one another."'
'A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with her) said:

"The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) used to accept gifts and give
something in return."'
The Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Give presents to one another,, for a present removes rancor.''"
The gift belongs to the recipient once he gets it with the permission of the
giver, after which the latter is prohibited to take it back. However, if the gift

is not yet given to the reGipient, 1t is pennissibl'e for the giver to take it back
due to the following l!,;tdith narrated by "A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with
her) . She nar,rated that Abu Bakr Ai;-Siddiq, he.r father, granted her an amount
of twenty wasqs • of the dates of some palm trees in Al-' Aliyah (a place near

Ii one is granted a g:ifr that is already a trust With him or borrowed money
in his ,llabillty, it becomes his wid1oul having to give it back and retake it from

die debtor. and thus there will be no liability oo the part of the debtor to pay
back such a debt, Tn additinn, "it ls permissible to give as a gift whatever canoe
legally sold.
It is invalid to make 'the gift dependent on a fulllre condition,.as when the
giver says to the recipient, ''If such ;md S\lCh happens, this gift wiU be yours."
An exception of this ruling is when the giver oli{'ulates that the gift is to be
given to the recipienl aftec the giver dies, RS when h~ says 10, the r~cipient,
"When I die, such and such is yours~ 1n this case,.the gift will be. regarded as a

In fact, giving gifts to oneanofher removes rancor and malice from people's
heart.s,and begets love and ,:;oncord among them: the Prophet (PBUH) says:

''Give presents to one a, nuther, for- a present removes rancor front
the heart:'"

On Uie other band, -a gift should not be rejected even if it is very humble
or Httle. It 1san act of the St11111ah to give something in return for the gift as.
the Prophet (PBUH) used to accept gifts and give something in return, ,which
reflects the glorious Islamic values 11nd noble char;icter.

Disposal of One's Property
during Sickness
The validity of one's disposal of one's own property while being in a sound
health differs from that in sickness, as long as one disposes of his property
according to the Shari'ah ([slamic law) and reason, and as long as this
disposition is nor open to question. [tis worth mentioning that giving charity
in sound health is mu.;h better and more rewardable than giving charity while
being in sickness.
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"And spend [in the way ofAlla/1)from what We have provided yo11
before death approaches one ofyou and he says, 'My Lord, if only
You would delay me for a brief term so l would give charity and
be among the righreous.' But never will Allah delay a 1oul when its
time ha, come. And Allah ii Acquainred With what you do."
(Qur'm: AI-Munafiq!\n: 10 - 11)

V INHERffANCE

221.

rt h related in the Two S.a/:Jibs' that when \h.e Prophet (PBUH) was ~sked
about the kind of charity that has the greatest reward, He (PBUH) answered~
''(The greatest charity is 1ht1t which) yoir give in charity when
y ou are healthy and niggardly hoping to be wealthy and afraid of
b.ccomlng poor. Do not delay giving 111 charity anti/ the time when it
(i.e. the so11/ at deatM reaches the throat and you saJ\ 'Givr so muc}i
to so an,.f so and so m11ch 10 so and so.'and at that Hme the-property
rs not yours but it bclu11gs tu so ·and so (i;e, yo11r ioileritors)," '

There are Two Types of Diseases
First: Cunble diseases: 'l'he,s e are diseases which do not· oormaHy I~ad
to death, such as toothache, eye· pain or non•acL11e headache. lp such

cases, similar to a J,ealtl\y person, {I sick person's disposal of his own
pro11erty is valid..thus, ones dispositton of all one's properly ~such as
gifts, endowments anc\ donntions etc.) in this cnsc is valld, even if one's
illness changes irllo ~n incunble-disease and leads to death.

Second: Lncurahle diseases: This is the illness which usuaUyresults in death.
in such cases, a sick person's donations and gifts are valid up 10 only
one-third of his money and not from his fixed capital. lfhls dispositions
oflm prope~tyexceedone-lhird, then they are inv~lid, unless approved
by his heirs after his death. The Prophet (PBUH) said;
".Allah made a i;/u:1rity 11po11 you at deal/1 by (allowing yotJ to give) 1methird ofyour wealih (as a charily) tu increase your (good) deed$.'''
(Related by lbh MilJah n1id Ad-Oaraqutnl)
The nforementioned badiih and those with similar meanings.indicate
that a St'tk person's disposal of his money upon hts death s'hould
not exceed one-third of his wealtH. This is the opinion adopted by
the majority of scholars. This is becau5e 11 person .slifferi ng from ;m
iocurnble disease rs likely to die and -:my disposition of his fixed capit,11
w.ill harm his inher,itors; therefore, his gifis are limiled to one-thfrd
only, the same as the will.
Similar to incurable disea~cs are dangerous circumstances, such as
being in a COUJJtlr}• where there is an epidemic, in ihe baltle'l'ield, Or
while traveling on rough sea6 in a storm; in such cases, disposing of
more than one-third of the eJ\tire property is invalid unlessi!p.proved
by the inheritors after his death. Llkewir.e. ifa person in such Conditions

m

donates to a iegal heir (who is entltled to a prescribedsbare) under any
of such circumstances, then l)is disposition ls invalid unless approved
by his inheritors. This is in case he dies in these circumstances. Yet,
ifa person recovers from sucb a serious disease, then all bis gifts are
considered valid, due to the absence of the impedimentary cause.
The rulings on a healthy person are the same as those per1:1ming to the
person baving a chronic disease, put not confining him to bed. Th~ donations
give.o by such a person from .all o( his money (not only one-third) is valid.
That ls because this chronic disease does not normally lead to <lea lb, so it is the
same as the case of oid ~ge. Nevertheless, i( thls chronic desease forces a person
io stay tn bed, then his case is tht same as the one afflicted with nn incurable
illness, Thus, h~ cannot bequeath more thai\ one-thitd nf his property unc1 he
is pol to beq11~th to anyone of the legal heirs except when the heirs appt'Ove
of that. That is because, a bedridden person is likely to die.
One-third of the deceased person's property should be taken inlo conSi<l•
e.ration at the time of his de~tb, since it is the time at which ownership of
a beql!est is transferred from the testator (or his heirs) to the legatee. Tbus,
at this time bequest6 and donations are to be fulfilled fro111 one-third of theproperty. However, if his entire property is not enough to cove.r his bequests
and donatio11s, then donations take precedence over bequests in being applied
since they are effective before his. death (while bequests are effective after), 11s.
if they are made while he is in sound l1eallh.

Paqi/1s' (may Allah have1nen:y on them) state that beqvests a,·e diffe~ent
from current dispositions (such as .gifts, endowments an(\ donations, elc.) in
four thing~:
Firstly: There is no differen~e between the firstly mentioned legatees and.
those mentioned later in the bequest. because all of the bequeathed
property is to be djsposed of after lhe testator's death, all at once. On
(he coJ1trary1 cu11·ent dispositions are implemented one after another
according to their order.
Secondly: One can not cancel one\ current dispnsilions after they have
already been given while one has lite right to pu:JHfy the bequest or
revoke it at any time since it is applic;ible only <1fter one's death.
'1:hirdly: Cnrrentdispnsitions are effective before the death of the donor
while bequests ,ire effectiw after. In other words, current disposition&
ar~ normally implemented whenever t hey ex:ist. A,; for a bequest, It (s
a transfer of ownership which comes into operation after the testator's
death; therefore, it is not effective before his death.

V f:Nl-lBRJTANCE

124

Fourthly: The transfet· ofownership pfcurrent dispositions i~ al the time

of accepting them, even before the death of the donor. Conver~ely, !.he
time at which !)Wilt'Fship of a bequest is transferred from the testator to
the legatee is the death of the testator, since it is a trl\r1sfer i)f ownership
whlc:h comes into op<imtiort afterthe.t esWor'!i death, r.o it mu~t not be
taken before its due time.

Wills

A will, according to faqihs' definition, is a legal declaration of how a person
wishes his possessions to be disposed of after his death. In other words, it is an
action in which one donates one's property to be given after one's death.
The will is legislated according to the Qur'an, the Sunna/1 (Prophetic
Tradition) and consensus. Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"Prescribedfor you when death approachu [any] one ofyou ifhe
leaves wealth (is that he should make] a bequest for the parents
and near relatives according to what is acceptable - a duty upon
the righteous."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 180)
And He also says:

"... After any bequut he {may have} made or debt..."
(Qur'an: An-Nisa': I I)

.Moreover, the Prophet / PBUH) s.ild:

"Allah made a charity upon }'011 at deatlr b)I (allowing you to give) orrethird ofyour wealth (as a charfty) ta increaseyout(good) ilceds."'
In additio11, there is a unanimous agreement among Muslim scholars on
tbe permissibility of the will.
Tiie will is obligatory 10 be made in some cases and is desirable in ol'he_rs.
lt isobligatory for a person 10 determine by a ,viii all fin;mcial ri.ght'S ofolhers

,~hich he is holdiug, or bls- financial rights wbicb others are holding. This is
to be done in case these rights are not recorded, lesr I.bey should be fost The

"It is not permissible for any Mitslim who has something to will
to stay far two nigltts witf1out having his last wiJJ and le,famen/

Thus, if someone has deposits or rights which he owes to some people, be

ft ls desfrable for a person to bequeath a portion of' his property to charity,

the reward of which will be recorded for him after death. The Lawgiver'
permitted one to give one-third of one's wealth (as a charity) to increase one's
good deeds.

Similar Lo prayer, a will is volid from a sane boy. A w'ill is le.gall)' valid if

• A bequest is desirable from a-we~llhy person whose heir is wdl -off, for
Allah. Exalted be He, says:
''Prescribed for yott when death approaches (any] one Qjyou if
he leaves wealth {i.< that he should make) a be.t{uist.. .''
(Qur'an: AI-Baqarah: 180)
The word 'wealth' )n the .ifo.re~aid ver&e Implies that the testator
should be r-l,;h i" order to make a bequest. l'urthermore, a bequest is
not desirable from t/le poor person who has little money and whose
heirs are in need ofhis money, Bydoing so. he will be abandoning his
relatives, who are in need of his money; for the benefit of strangers.
The Prophet (PB(JfJ) said to Sa' d Ibn Abu Waqqd_s:

"You rvoukl better leave your inheritors wealthy rather /han leaving
. poor, beggmg
' others.,,,.

Ibn AbO ]Jllib said to a man,

"Yott have left only litlle,propcrty, so let it go to your heirs.""
Moreover, many of the Prophet's Companions did not make bequests.

• It is prohibited for a testator to make ~ bequest with the i11te9iion of
harining and annoying his inheritors, for, by doing this. he will l:ie
committing a sin. Allah, Exalted be He, said:

•~ ..as long as there is t10 detriment [ca11sed} ..."
{Qur'an: An-NisA': 12)
A sirnilar meaning is implied in the following aadith in which the

• One may bequeath W's entire prop~rty if he has no inheritors, for th!!
Prophet (PBUH) said:

"You would better leave-your inheritors wealthy rother than Teaving
them poor, begging other.,;•';
The permissibility of bequeathing the entire property, providing tbe1·e
are no legai helrs, is stated in ab,adlth reported about !bn Mas' Od (may
Allah be pleased with him)". Also, the majority of Muslim scholars
are of the same view, bticause the prohibition of bequeathing more
than one-third is only io r tl1e sake of the inheritors; thus, if there are
no inheritors, then there will be no reason for prohibition. Moreover,
bequeathing the enti re property will not harm any one since there are
no heirs or creditors, and it is as if the testator had devoted \111 his money
in charity during bis life. 1n this regard, Imam lbnol-Qayyim s~d:

"The soundest upinion is that the testator has the right to bequeath, his
entire property. pro1tidrng he has 110 heirs. That is because the Lawgiver
ha; for/,idden bequeath/rig rooni than one-third only if tl1ere are J,-gal
inheritors, so the one who lias no i11herllors can do wluitever he wants
with his moneyt "
• If onc-thlrd of the testator's current money does nol cover the amount
of !he money assigu(d un his bequest, and the heirs have refused to
authorize \he excess ove1'. one,third, then the tunount of the portions
of all the legatees is to be, decreased. each one by virtue of his allotted
share. There is no differe nee between the legatees mentioned first and
those_ mentioned latei fn the bequest because all of the bequeathed
property is to be dispos,id of after the testator's death; therefore., the
bequeathed property has become du~ at the same time. Tims, ihe
excess is to be deducted from the legatees' portions at the same time,
since they (the legatees) equally share the property but may difl'Qr in

230

V INHE.R!TANCE

the amount deducted from each one's share, just as the case with
the 'awl". Similar to this i& the ca&e wberein a testator bequeaths a
hundred riyals for a person.a hllndred riyals fora<Second person, fifty
riyal& for a third person, thirty riyals for a fourth per&on, and twenty
riyals for a 6fth person, thereby the t6tal amount be has beq11eathed
is three hundred riyals. Yet, one-third of his entire property is only
hundred riyals. Thus, each person is to be given only one-1hlrd of
the portion he was allocated in the bequest.

• The validity or the invalidity of the bequest, with regard to legatees,
is considered at the time of the death of the testator. for example,
if a person bequeaths to a legal heir and at the time of death of the
testator this .h eir becomes1111 illegal heir, such as the case of a brother
who has been e~cluded (ofbei'ng an heir) bya testator's newborn son.
In this case, the bequest is considered Valid at the time of death of
the testator because i t is the time al which O\vnei:ship of a bequest
is transferred from t.he testator to his .heirs and legntees. On the
contrary; if a testator makes a bequest for an illegal heir aqd at the
tin:ie of death of the testator lhls illegal heir becomes a legal heir, the
bequest will nol be valid. An example for that ls the case of a testator
who bequeaths lo his brofher while the testator's son \s still alive at
the time of the beqUClit and this son dies after that. Thus, the bequest
is considered invalid µnless a1.1thod:zed by the other heirs because the
testator's brother has become a legal hek at the time oi.the testator's
de>;1th. Consequently, the acceptance of a bequest by the legatee is only
relevant after the death of the testator and pot before, and also the
transfer of ownership ofa bequest from the ~estator or his heirs to die
legatee is only after (he death of the testator, and it is not permissible
for the legatee lo accept 't he bequest before the death of the testat<lr.
.Al-Muwaffaq said:

'There is 110 d/ffere11ce of opinion amongst schutars that ihe ,pu/(dily
.of the bequest is considered at the time of the testator's deati~ If the
bequest is tQ non-specific i11divid11als, such as rhe poor, the family of
.so and so, or for a public i111erl!SI such as building. mosques, then it is
.effective immediately after the testators Jeat/1, and the acceptalice of
the bequest by the legMee is irreleva,11 i11 ~w:lt cases, But if the bequest
is made in fa.vo,· of q partlwlar Individual, then rhe. ownership of the
article bequeathed depends on tl,e accept,mce of the legatee after the

• The testator has the right to revoke rus will by a subsequent wili,. or
nullify it, completely or partially. 'To. illustrate, ; Omar (may Allah he
pleased with him) said:

"One has the right to cha1•1ge w/1ate11er one likes ill ones beqr1est,""
There is also an agreement amongsr. people of knowledge with regard
to this matter. If a testator makes Some article a bequest bu:t then he
says. ''T changed my mind:' or says any word which implies that'lie ii;
nullifying his bequest pr pnrt ofjt, then'his bequest is nullified That is
because the time of the deatl\ ,of the testator is the only relevant time,
with regard to the validitty of the bequest and the acceptance or the
rejection of the bequests- by the legatee. Thus, the testator has the right
lo revoke his will during his lifetime. For example, if a testator says,
"If X comes, I bequeath 1:o him what I liave bequeathed to Z:' and X
has come during the testa.ror'&lifetime, then the bequest is to X, and in
such case the testator's bc~uest to Z is nullified. However, if X comes
after the testator's death, then the beqtiesl is to Z. That is becau&e the
testator's death has been before the arrival ofX; thus, the bequest bas
(been) settled and Iransforred to Z.
• Obligatory expenses such ,u debts and religious obligations like Zaktih,.
eic,piaJ:ions., vows and tla;ij, must be paid flrst, wheiher mentioned in

(Qur'an: AI-Mumtabinah~8)
• Bequeathing to a particular non-Muslim indiVidual'is valid, as p~viously
mentioned:.hnwever, it l.s impennissible to bequeath to disbelfevers
in gene.ral. For example, tf one bequeaths to Jews or Christians, in

genera.I, or their ,poor people, then his bequest is considered invalid.
Similarly, it Is impennissiible to bequeath anythi11g which must not be
owned by a non-Maslim ;to a particular disbeliever, such as the Noble
Qlu'an, a Muslim slave, o,r rutns.
•• Bequeathing to a person :rel unborn Js permissible. provided thot t'.he
child is either born alive·wlthin six months of the time the bequ~t is
made, if the mother has a husband, or is born a Live within a period less
than four years after the bequest is made if the mother ls husbandles.q.
Such fetus legally inherit,;; thereupon, bequeathing to i t Js permissible
with greater reason. However, if the child 1s born dead, the bequest
.becomes invalid. Nevertheless, a bequest to an unborn child, who has
11ot existed at the rime during which the bequest is made, is im•alid.
!>or example, ifone &ays, "l bequeath such and such a_ lblng to the child
whom this wo1n~11 will b,e pregna"t With," then his bequest.islnval,d
since lie is beqt1eathing tc) a nonexistent person.

• If the testator bequeaths a great amount of money for performing Hajj
on his behalf, then the bequeathed money should be fully paid for
doing as many time& as can be until the money is exhausted. But if the
bequeathed moaey is littl,e, the11 it must be paid [Jl dving pilgrimage on
behalf of the deceased acl:otdlng to j\g amount However, if tlie testator
stipulates that the big 11mou111 of mnney he has bequeathed is to be
spent in one Hajj on his behalf, then at must be spent in one Hajj, for
he has intended by doing this the benefit of the one performing Hajj
on his behalf. In such cases, it is not permissible for the executor or nn
inheritor to perform Uajj on behalf of the deceased, because the testator
apparently specified another one to perform Hajj on his behalf.
• Bequeathing to anyone wlio is not capable of possessing t he beqvesl i~
invnlid such as bequeai hi:ng to a jtnni, an animal or a dead person.

V INHERITANCE

• Needless to say, nothing in the will should be contrary to Sl,arf '11/, (Islamic
Law), such as bequ,;atlting lo churches or !em2les of disbelievers and
polytheists. Similarly., it is iJllpermissible 10 bequeath to keeprng or
lighting graves or to ·the gatekeepers of these grave!;, whether the testator
is a Muslim or a disbellever. Shaykhul-lslim Thu Taymiyah said:
1

")fa Jewish or a Ch:rlstian bequeaths a portion of his property to thei;temples, l11e11 Mt1s/i1rrs must invalidate tliis bequest, because t'hey mw.st

Allah. Thus, Muslims must not J11lfill 11 bequest fl/ places wl1erein people

Similarly, it is impermissible to bequeath to pu\)lisbing abrogated
books such as the Tor~h and the Gospel, or publishing perverted
books such as books of atheism.
• ,It is a necessary condition for the valldtty ofo bequest to beoflegal money
or of utilizing sometlting permissible even if the item bequeathed
is something undeliverable, such as, a Aying bird, an embryo, the
milk in the udder of a milch animaL or something not yet existent.
For example, some,lne may bequeath the fruits of a tree foreve1· or
for a certain period, one year, for example, or he may bequeath what
a certain animal may delive.r. fo such a case, lhe beqLtest is for the
legate..: only wb~n sue~ inexistent thing ,materializes. However, if such
inexistent thing doi:s not materialize, then the bequest Is considered
invalid, for in such case there Is no bequeathed item in f.nct.
• Among things that may be bequeathed i.s sornetlting or someone urtknown
such as bequeathing an unknown animal In such a case, the legatee ls
given anything by th1at me-.ms. in reality or according to custom.
• If the testator beque11ths one-third of his estate, and after making his
bequest he gets more money, then this extra money must be included
in his bequest Thls Is because, the one-third B considered from t·he
entire property own.ed by the testator at the time of his death,
• lftbe hequeat:hed property ls damaged before or after the death of the
tesr-.itor, then the bequest is considered invalid, and the legatee·~ right

he has not specified the amount of the bequeathed property, then
the inherilor is to give tlhe legatee any .imount of money, since the

Rulings Related to the Executor
• The executor is 1hc person. who is appointed by the testator to dispt1se
of the ostate after the testator dies. That is to say, the. executor i;; in
charge of all 1hal the te~t~itor has been in ohnrge-of during his lifo. So,
the bi:quest executor is tfi1e testator's deputy,
• A"~til1g this· deputy1ihip (i.e. tQ be the executor) is desirable, and is
l-OllSidered an act of wonfuip by which one attains nearness l.o Allah.
Yet, thisdeputyship is per:missibleonlyfoi the one who has the capacity
and tl\c honesty to und~rta:ke the bequest A:llah, Exalted be He, says;

(Qur'An: AI-Ma'idah: 2)
The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) 6aicl:

Also, (he Prophet's Companions used to assign deputies to dispose

• The Bxecutor of the bequest mu~t be a Muslim, as it is lmpetmlssible
to appoint ,i non-Muslim lo be an executor ofa w!II. Moreover, the
executor must be legally accountable, fot it is not valid to ap!'oint a
little boy, an insane or a foolish ( or weak-minded) person as executors
of wills, because they are not capable of u.nderr-alcing .guaidianship
responsibilities. Yet, one may appoint a !:>oy to be the executor
when that boy reaches leg~] majority, as the Prophet (PBUH) said
concerning the Battle of Mu'tah, 1vhen he appointed Zayd as, the
commander of the .Muslim army,

''If Zayd is martyred, Jn 'far is r11 take nver his positio1L~~1
• Appointing a female executor is considered valid, provided that she has
the ability to undertake the bequest responsibilities. That -is becl\llse
' IJmar Ibni.ll Khal1Ab appointed his daughter Haf§ah a& the executor
of his wilt Moreover, a woman can be a legal witness; hence, she can
'be 11ppointedas an executor of a wiU.
• [t is also valid to appoint an executor who cannot practice the work

by himself. provided that he ls of sound. reasoning, and can appoint
another honest one to help him. ln addition, it is valid to appoint
:rµore than one executor, whether they are appointed by the testator
at the same time or one after another, If the testator- ~ppoints.
more than one executor, then they should manage the bequest
collectively. Each execttror should not .act independently of the
other exe,;utor(s), i.e, their ;icts proce.ed from the decision of the
group. If one of them dies or is absent, then those in authority are to
appoint another one ,i nstead, who musl be capable of undertaking
the responsibility:
• Appointing an executor of the bequ~sl is c9psidc:red valid if the
e,xecuror accepts this responsibility while the testator fs still alive or
after his death. Moreover, both the bequest execulor and the teslator
ho.ve fhe right to cance:I thi~ appointment whenever they wish Le.
before or after lhe testator's death. This is because the executor is
j~st a deputy.
• :11is impennissible for the bequest executor tu l\ppl)iut another executor

1:1nless the testator 11uthori1.es the executor to appoint whomever he
d1ooses as executor of the bequest. The items i n the will must be
known and defined so thr executor of the will tan uphold and dispose
of these Items.

• The testator rn1.1s1 f\ave the le.gal authority to dispose of whatever he bequeall\s 1n his will, such as paying a debt, distributing the bequeathed
third, looking after the welfare of h.is children,, and so forth. Consequently; the bequest executor undertakes the bequest according 10
pemtission from the test11tor. Thus, as iu the case of deputyship, the
bequest execulor cannot ,dispose of anything which the testator does
not have the legal authori"ty to dispose of. Moreover, the testator i~ the
original ownei· and the b,iquest executor is his deputy; c.onsequently,
the deputy does not own what the original owner does not actually
pQssess,- In brief, it is inv,llid for the test;1t9r to b~q1,1e.atb Whllt he does
not really own, such as, tine case wherein a woman testator appoints
someone as the guardian ofhe.r children, this appointment is considered invalid since guardlanshlp is only for the father.
• The authority of the executor of the will is limited to wbat the testator
has specified i.e. If the exe!cutor is appointed by the testator .to pay his
debts, then he does not ha 1-e the legal right to act as the guardian of-the
children. Thus, like the deputy, the executor's d'uty as an executor of
the will is limited to what the testator has authorized him to do.
• l t ls valid f<fr the bequest executor tu be a Muslim ifthe testator is a nonMuslim. provided that the testator's estate does not include anything
legally prohibited. So, if the testator's estate includes what i& forbidclen
such as-liquor or swine-, tl~eu this uppointment (the appointment of a
Muslim executor) is invallid. That is because it is impermissible for a
Muslim tu be in charge of &uch. prohibited things.

• If the testator says to the executor, for example, "I authorize you to
distribute the beq ueathed third (of my property) as you wish," or
'"I authorize you to spernd the bequeathed third in charJty among
whomever you choose," t hen it ls impermissible for the execuroi to
fake -an.ything of this money for himself, because the testator has not
pern\Itted thl1. Moreover, it is not permis;ible for the executor to give
his children or his heirs anything from this money, because in this
c;ise he is more likely to Ee biased toward them.

If someone dies in a place where there is no governor or :guardlan, such
as some.one dies in a desert. then it is permissible for one of those who ,are
present to manage his estate, ,1nd do what is appropriate such as selling his
estate and the like. That is becao.u;e it is a state of necessity, for if his estate i~
left, it will be spoile<), a.nd protect iug that person's estate is a collective duty. it
is worth mentioning {hat funeral ,exp;:n~es. in such a case, are 10 be paid from

Inheritance: Rulings

The issue of inheritance is of a fundamental importance. The Prophet
(PBUH) encouraged Muslims to learn the rules of inheritance and teach them
to others, as he (PBUH) said:

"Learn the rules of inheritance and teach ihem to others for they are
halfofknowledge and they art! liable to be forgotten. Besides, they are
the first (branch of knowledge) to be taken away from my nation.'''
(Related by lbn Majah)
In another version, he (PBUH) said:

"i am a mortal and knowledge will be taken away and rrials will
appear until ( there would be) two persons who would differ about
a case of inheritance and cannot find anyone to give a judgment
.
. nl
concernmg 1t.
(Related by At-Tirrnidhi and Al-Hakim)

V INHERITANCE

Needless to say, whot ,the Prophet (PBUl-1) said has happened; thfs branch
of Shari' ah (Islamic Law) has been ignored arid for-gotten; it is rarely t;mght
in !llOSques or :in Muslim< ichools except through very insufficient studies in
some educational institutions, wl:tich neither give the sufficient knowledge nor
guarnntee its survival
Thus, Muslim6 should set to ·renew' this .branch of Sharf' 11l1 (lslamic Law),
3.11d preserve it in mosques, schools and universities, for they are in dire need
of this knowledge, and also they will be held responsible for it. Moreover, it is
stated that the Prophet (l'BUB') said

"(Religious) knowledge has three categories; anything else is extra;
a precise verse, or cm established Simnah (Prophetic Tradition); QT'
3
a firm nlle of fnhei·itance."
'Umar Ibmil-Khattab (may Allah 'be pleased•with him) said:

"Learn the rules of inheritance, for they qre part.ofyour religiof1.•

1

Also, ' Abdullt.h Ibn Mas· i'ld (may Allah be pieased with him) said:
"Whoever reads the (Noble) Qurlin should learn the rules of
!riheritance."'

The rules of inheritance have pcobabty been referred to as- "half of
knowledgen in the !!ad/th reported from the Prophet (PB\!JH), because they
include most of the Islamic rulings that have to do with human beings iI! the
:state ofdeath, and the other remaining rulings are concerned with human life.
ltis also said that the rules of inheritance are so called (Le. "halfofknowledge")
because all human beings are in need of them. Actually, there are many reasons
for referring to the rules ofinheritanc-e that way, the important of which is rhal
il encourages one 10 study the rules of inheritance,
The laws of inheritance refer to the shares allotted to legal heirs by the
Noble Qur'~. 1n other words, they are the prescribed shares of the estate
which are to be given to 'those who deserve Ihem. The laws of.inheritance deal
with the correct distribution of the wealth of a deceased person. The studrof
rules of inheritance ls the studyof,estate division, their juristic rulings, and the
calculations for distributiA,g shares.
When ,i Musllm dies, five rights are deducted from his estate, The first
thing taken from his property is the expenses ofpreparing his body for being
buried such as the cost of the shroud, washing his body and the washer's fee-,
prepa,:ing his gr.1ve, and $0 forth, Then, the rights he owes are to be paid,

whether they are tights of All!lh, Exalted be He, (6uc:h as 2aktll1, expiati6ns,
vows-or obligatory Hajj), or debts to people. After these expenses are deducted,
his bequest must be fulfilled, provided that it does aot exceed one-thiid of his
estate, as previously mentioned. After that, the remaining property1s divided
between his legal heirs, accordirtgto'lhe laws ofinheritanc-e. Finally, the rest of
the property, if there i's any, is for agnate relatives,• as-wiU be explained later.
Changing the laws of inheritance, which are decreed by Allah, is tmpermissible and ls, consideted,an act of disbelief, for Allah, Exalted be He, ·sayJL-

"l71e1e are the limits [setlly} AIJQh, and whoever obeys Allah and

(Qur'/in: An-Nisa': 13-i4)

With regard to these verses, Imam Ash-ShawkAnl (may Allah have me)'cy
on hitn) stated in his exegesis of the Qur'an:
"The word 'these'; in the aforemem:i-011ed verse, refers to the laws of
i11herilllnce which are iliscussed ·i11 lhe rwu verses preaedi11g these two
verses mentioned above. Allah, Exalted be He, refers r.o these laws
as 'li111its' because it is impemiissible to exceed the limits of I/Iese

equal to that of two females. Such a person is deemed a disbeliever and will be
cast into tbe Fire to abide eternally lherei.Jl unless he repents to Allah before

he dies.
People uf -fhe Pre-Jslamic Period of Ignorance (Al fahiliyyah) used to
disinherit women and children; only adult males, wbo can ride horses and
llold weapons; were entitled to inherit Then, the Islamic rdigion came to
inv.iltdote this system, and Allah, Exalred .be ffe, said;

'"For me,r is a slrare of what tl,e p1Jre11ts t111d close relati.ves,leave,

(Qur'~n: An-Nisa't,7)
This verse abolishes the .syctem that us<!d to be applied before Ish,m when
women and children used to be disinherited. The following two verses also
abolish the contemporary systems that treat males and females on an equal
footing, with regard to the shares of inherit:an,e. This is considered an act of
opposrng Allah, Exalted be i:Ie, and fi[s Messenger ( l>BU H) and transgressing
His ,limit~, as Allah says:

(Qur'an: An- Nisa: I l)

,\ nd He also says:
"...Tf there ore both brothers and sisters, the male will have /Ire
share oftw.o femaks ..."
(Qur'~: An-Nisa': 176)

The Pre-Islamic Period of1gno(ai1ce (Al,.Ja/,iliyyah) deprived women totally
from all theirrights in inheritance, whereas, ironically enough, contemporary

Causes of Inheritance
and the Lc!gal Inheritors

Inheritance is the transfer of the legal possession of a deceased person to
his heirs, according to the laws of inheritance ordained by Allah.

There are three causes of inheritance:
I. Blood Relationship: Blood relation refers to the relation between
two persons by birth rathter than by marriage, no matter how far or
near the relationship is, as long as nothing or none blocks them from
receiving their prescribed shares. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"... But those of {blood] relationship are more entitled [to
iflheritance] in the decme of Allah." (Qur'an: AI-Anfill: 75)

Blood relationships include the forefathers, the offspring and the
collateral relatives. The paternal forefathers indude the father, the

V lNH.ffiffANCE

246

paternnl grandfather a11d so forth in ascending lineage, who are
linked thiough males to a common ancestor. The offspring include
the son. the grands.o n by the son and so forth in descending linetige.
The collateral rela1,ives include the brothers and their children. no
matter how far down they descend, as well as paternal uncles, sons
1
ofparetnal ttndes {cousins), and so forth in a descending lineage .

2. Marriage: The marriage must be according to a correct (valid)
contract of marriage, even if ther.e i< no consummation and the two
spouses bove not yet met in privacy. This is due to the statement of
Allah. £xi11ed be He:

':.ind for you is h~/f of what your wives leave if they ha.ve no
child, BIii if they hr.ive a ahlld, for you is one fourth of what they
leave. aftera11y be1j1uest they {may have] m11de or debt, And/or
them (i.e. the wives} Is o,iefourth..." (Qur'an: An-Nisa': 12)
The two spouses inherit from each other according to the aforesaid
verse, and nlso in the case if a revocable divorce is pronounced as long
as the woman is s\ill in the waiting period, for, during the wait ing
period, the woman is still a legal wife. The phrase "the correct cohtract
of marrfage" excludes the Incorrect contracts of marriage. for the right
of ±nheritaoce arises from only a valid contract of marriage, and the
incorrect marriage ,does not affect' the rulings .o n inheritance.

3, The wald' (the freed slave's loyalty by virtue of emancipation):
!I is a relatiohship between the master and the manumitted slave, in
which the former inherits any property the latter may acquire due to
the farmer's fuvor done to the !alter. The inh.eratance is. from only one
side. i.e. if the man,umitted slave die.,;, the emancipator inherits from
him, and not vice versa.. If the emancipator dies, then his universal heirs
by oneself, ~nd 110\ co-universal heirs, inherit from this manumitted
slave. To illustrate, the Prophet (PBUH) says,

"T/1e walti' Is a bond like that ofkinship.'"(Related oy lbn Hi bb4n in his Authentic Book of Hadith, and also
related and deemed iahih (authentic) by Al-H1kim)
Thus, he (PBUH} made .the walif similar to blood relationships.
Therefore, the wala" is-a cause for in.heritance like blood relationships,
according to the consensus of Muslim scholars. Moreover, il is related
in the Two ;iallih.s' that the Prophet (PBUi-J) said;
"Verily, the w11hl' is for the emancipator."

Inheritors According to Gf:nder
lrihedtorr. are divided into ma:ie ahd fomnle heirs. Male heirs are ten:

• The son, the son of rlw son, and ~o froth iii a descenclin_g male
lineage. for Allah, lixalted •be He, says:

"A/111/i i,utructs yo11 conce.r,1/ng yo11r cllil,lnm [i.e, their portio11s

(Qur?t\n: An, Nis.i': 11)

"O childte11 ofAdam...n

(Qur'an: Al-A' raf: 26)

And also Allah , Exah.ed b,: He, says:

"r;)Childrtm of fsrr,el ..."

(Qur'an: AI-Baqarah: 40)

• T.he father, the palema] grandfather, and any forefatheri: of the
paternal grandfather. This ts because AJ!ah, Exalted be He, snys:

".. ,Antifor one's parents, to eac/r one ofth,mt is a sixth of his

(Qur'{in:· An-Nisa': l l)
fv!oreover, the paternal g.randfathec is t!].e same as \he father, f~r (he
Prophet (PBUH) judges !hat he inherits one-sixth of the estate, fho

• The brother, whether he ii: a full.or halFbrolher: This is because All:1h,

• The son of a full brother or the son of a lialf brother from the
same father; 11s for the son of the brother who ha~ the same mother
of the deceased, bu11 a different father, he does not inherit because he
is one of the blood irelatives.

• The father's full brother (paternal uncle) a.nd the father's half
brother from thti same father and the son of the aforesaid
paternal uncle (cc1usin) and so forth in descending line,ige,However,
the fathers half brc,ther from different fathers does nof inherit from

who are -entitled to receive them. Then whatever remains thould be

".And for you is l!ulf of wl,at yoi1r wives leave ..."

(Qur'an: An·Nisa': 12)

• The emancipator 1\lho has the right t>f the wauf or hi~ heirs, ' for ,the

Types of Inheritors According to Their Shares of Inheritance
Inheritors according to their shares of inherito.nce are of three categ!)ries:
• Those entitled to specified prescrihed shores that do not increase unless.
through the radii"' nor decrease unless through the '·awl (reduction of
the helrs' share~).
• Agnate relatives: Those whose shares of inheritance are not deflped
• Blood relatives: They are to inherit when there is none entitled to prescrlbed
shares - .except for the spouses - and when there are no agnute heir~.

Inheritance of Spouses

The husband inherits one-half the estate if the deceased wife does not
have a child (male or female; even if from another husband), or a grandchild
by her son. However, the husband inherits one-fourth if the deceased wife has
a child, or a grandchild by her son. To illustrate, Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"And for you is halfof what your wives leave if they have no child.
But if they have a child, for you is one fo11rth of what they leave,
after any bequest they [may have] made or debt..."
(Qur'an: An-Nisa': 12)

The wife (or the wives together) inherits one-fourth the estate ifthe deceased
husband does not have a child (male or female; even if from another wife), or
a grandchild h)• his son. She (or the wives together) inherits one-eighth if the
deceased husband has a child or a grandchild by his son. To illustrate, Allah,
Exalted be He, says:

Inheritance of Fathers and
Paternal Grandfathers

The father of the deceased or the paternal grandfather (in case the father
is dead) is entitled to inherit one-sixth of the estate as a prescribed share if the
deceased has a son or a grandson by his son. This is because Allah, Exalted be
He, says:

'~ . .And for one) parents, to each o,u, of them is a sixth of his
e.tate I/he left children..."
(Qur'an: An-Nisa': 11)
The father of the deceased (or the paternal grandfather in case the father
is dead) inherits only by virtue of agnation if the deceased has no child, or a
grandchild by his son. This is according to the noble verse that states:

". ..But ifhe had no children and the parents [alone] inheritfrom
him, then for his mother is one third..." (Qur'an: An-Nisa:': 11)

V TNHERJTANCE

1h this verse, Allah, Eultcdbe He. entitles thtdnheritance to ,botb parents;
tlie mother inherits one-third of the estate whereas the share of the father is
not defined. Therefore, the father gets whatever remains of the estate by virtue
ofagnatlon.
The father (or £be patern;tl grandfather i'n case the father is dead) inherits
by virtue of both prescribed share and agnnlion if the deceased bas a daughter,
or a granddaughter by his son, The Prophet (PBUH) say&:
"Give the shares of the inheritance (prescribed in the Q11ri111) to

t·ho$e who are e11titled to receive 'them. Then whatever rwrnins
should be given to the dosest male relative of the deceased."'

That is to say, the rest o[ the ir1he_ritance goes to the closest male relative
of the deceased namely tbe fatbet, who is conside.red the closest male after the
son and the grandson.
To sum up, the father has three cases:
·• The first.: The father inhedts only by virtue of prescrabed share If
the deceased has a wn, or a grandson by his son, and so fort!\ in a
descending lineage.
• The second; The father inherits only by virWe of agoation in case
the decellSed has no s.on,.or a grandson by his son, and so forth in a
de,scending 1i neage,
• The third: The father inherits by virtue of both prescribed share and
agnation in case the deceased has a daughter, or a daughter of his .son.

Tht paternal grandfather io the ~..me as the father in the above three cases
as. meolioned to the Qu.r'an and the Swmah (Prophetic Tradition) in case the
father- is dead. However, the paternal graqdfather has an additional fourth
case; namely if the deceased has full brothers, or half brothers from the father's
side. Schdlars .have two different opinion.q in this regard.
The first opinion ls that paternal grandfather of the deceased equally
snares the estate with the deceased"s brothers without preventing
them from receiving their share, and then they nil equally sbate the
remaining estate by Yi:rtue of agnation according to certain known
rµles in this regard. this opinion ls based.on the fact fhntthe pnternal
.grandfather and the brothers of the deceased are equally agn~te
relativ~s of the deceased's father, who is alre.idy dead; the deceased's
paternal grnndfnther is hi~ father, and the deceased's brothers are bis

sons.1'.herefore, the decease d's paternal grandf.itber mid the deceased's
brothers share together the estate and the paternal grand fat.her is to he
treated as any one of them regarding inheritance. Th is is the opinion of
a group of the Prophet's Companions such a.s • Ali rhn Abu Ia!ib, lhn
Mas' Od, Zayd Ibo TMbit, and it is atso the opinion of Imarn Mallie.

A:hmad in this -regard. 'fherreachecl lhis opinlon on the basis of many
evidences, ijtilrad, ·' and analogicai cleduclions, which are mentioned
in the elaborative main volumes on inheritance.

The second opinion is that the existence of the paternal grandfather
prevents the deceased's brothers from inheritance just as the existence
of the father does. Th.is is the opinion or A,bil Bakr A~-£lddiq, lbn
•Abbas, and lhn A1,-Zuhayr. It Is nlso reported to have been adop1ed.by

Inheritanlce of Mothers

The mother of the deceased has three cases regarding inheritance:
The first case: The mother inherits one-sixth of the estate ifthe deceased
has an inheriting descendant, such as a child (male or female) or·a
grandchild by the son, or in case the deceased has two or more siblings,
whether males or females. This is because Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"... And fer one'.< parents:, to each one of them is a sixth of Ms
estate ifhe left children ..."
Then Allah says in the same verse:
'~ .. And if he had broth,~rs {and/orsisters],forhis mother is
( Qur'~n: An-Nisa: 11)
a sixth .. .''
The second case: The mother inherits one-third of the estate if the
deceased has neither a de,;cendant heir, such as a child ot a grandchild

by his son, nor doe!; he have two or more siblings, whether males or
females. This is because Almighty Allah says:

': .. But ifhe had 11b clr/ldren a11d tire parenu [alo11e.J inlicrlt
fro,n him, then for /~Is mother is one tlrird..."
(Qut'an: An"Nisa: JJ)

The1hir~ case: The mother inherits one-third of the remainder of the
estate. not of the est:ate itself, in anr of the following two c:is~:·

• If the deceased is a funmle and she: has ieft a husband, a father and
a mother
i If the deceased isa male and he has left a ·wife, a father, and a mother

These two ,ases .tre knciwn as the ' Umariyyatiln' because ·lJmar IbnulKhattab has judged that the (llother is to inheriL one-thitd of the remainder
of the estate after the deceased's spouse receives his/1\er share of the estate' Commenting on these two ,cases, Shaykhul-Islani lbn Toymiyah (may Allah
have mercy on him) said:

"The opitiicm judged by •Umar is t/ie soundest opinio11, because Allqh,
B:calted be He, entitles 1rhc mother to j11/rerit one-third ,ofthe'estate if

Inheritance of Grandmothers

The gr.mdmother tn"'1!ll here is the full grandmother, who is entitled
to inherit. In other words, it is every grandmod1er related to the deceased
through the mothers only, such as the maternal grandmother, her mother,
the latter's mother, etc. It is also every grandmother related to the deceased
through the fathers only, such as the father's mother; the paternal grandfather's
mother, and so on. A full grandmother is also the one whose daughter is a
mother of the fatbet, a mother of the paternal grandfather, or. a mother of
the paternal grandfather's futher, etc. However, the grandmother who is not
entitled to inherit is the one whose son is the mother's father, or the paternal
grandmother's father, etc. Such a grandmother does not inherit as she is
regarded as a cognate relative.
In short, the grandmother entitled to inherit is either one of three:
• The one whose daught.er is either the mother or a maternal grandmother of
the deceased; she is related to the deceased only through a female lineage

260.

V INHERITANCE

• The one whose·sonis ,either the fa_ther or~ paternal grandfather of the
deceased; she is related lo the deceased only through a male Hrteage
• The one whose daugh1et is a mother of either the father or a paternal
grandfather of the deceased
However, the grandmother who is not entitled to inherit is the one,whose
son is the mother's father; or the paternal grandmother's f;ither, etc. In other
word-,, she is the one who has a male child who~ immediate antestor and
offspring are two females, provided that she is one of them.
The evidence that a grandmother is to ihberit is derived from the Sunnah
(Prophetic Troditi9n) and scholnrs' consensus. As for the proof in the Sumtah,
it is nar:roted on the authority of Qabl!,ah Ibo Dhn'ayb (may Alhh be pleased
wilh him} that:
':it grandnwther went to Abu Bakr asking him for her share of

inheritance. He said, 'There is nothing pr~crlbed for you in Allal<s
Book (the Q11riln), nor do I know ar1ythfngfor you prescribed in
the Sunnah of the M~enger of Allah (PBUH). Go home until f
ask the people. He then asked the people. and Al-Mugh1rah Ib11
Shu' bah sa{d, '1 had been present with the Messenger of Allah
{P,BUH) when he gave a granamother one-sixth, of the estate: Abt)
Bah said, 'ls there anyone with you (to testify that the Prophet
(PBUH) did so)?' Muhammad 1h11 Maslamah stood and said the
same as Al-lyfughirah Ibn Shu 'bah /1ad said: So Abu Bakr granted
lier the sixth. Another grandmother came to 'Umar Jbnul-Khatt/Jb
asking 'him for her sliare ofinherilance. He srrid, 'Nothing has bee11
pr~cribed for you in Allah's Book bttt a sixth (of the estate). if there
are two ofyou, it is shared betwee11 yo11, but whoever ofyou is the
only one left gets it all.' "1
(Related by the Five Compilers of Hadflh except AIJ.-Nasa1, and 11t
ls deemed iahih (authentic) by AI-Tirmidht)
It is a.lso narrated on the authority of Bui-aydah who said:

"The Prophet (PBUH) entitled the grandmother to one,sixth of tJ1e
estate i11 case of the absence of the mother of the deceased."'
(Related by Abu DAwud and deemed Iabil! (authentic) by IbnusSakan, Ibn Khuzaymnh and lbnul-JarQd)

261

The aforementioned two /:J.adiths imply that a grandmother 'has the right
to inherit one-sixth though, as Abo Bakr Ai-Siddiq and ' Umar lbnul-Kliattab
indicated, there is no ruling for ,grand111o!hers in this ~gard 1n the Qut'an.
This is because the ruling of inheritance- regarding mothers that is mentioned
in the Book of Allah is restricted, to the direct mother, The grandmother can
al,o be called a mother. as AlmiS,lily AJJah, says:

"Prohibited Iv•you (for tt1al'riage] a,=e your ma/hers,.,"
tQur'an; J\n-Nisa': 23)
Bui she is not one of those er.tfitled tu the prescribed shares of inheritance
mentioned ln Qur'an. ln·spite of this, it is the Messenger of AUah (PBUH) who
entitled the grandmother to get one-sixth of the est~te, so her lnberi!ance i~
confirmed by a proof from the Sunna/1 (Prophetic Tradition).
Likewis~ a grandmother's in1heritanoe is confirmed by t,he consensus of
scholafs. There is no disagreement ;unong scholars regarding the right of
inheritance either fur the direct unaternal .grandmother or the direct paternal
grandmother;.however, they disagreed concerning other grandmothers. lbn
•Abbas and some scholars entitled grandmothers to inherit however numerous
they are, provided they are on the, samelevel of kinship to the deceased, except
the grandmother whose son ls a non,inheriting grnndforhet of the deceased,
sach as the 1nother of mother's father. Some other scholars are of the opinion
that on1y three grandmothers ar,e entilTed lo inberitance, namely the mother
of the deceased's mother, the mother of the deceased'& father, and the mother
of the !)jlternal grandfuther of the deceased.
The non-existence of the mc,rher of the. deceased (such as being dead) is
~ condition for the grandmothw,· to inherit. This is because the grandmother

is related to the deceased throug;h the mother, .and the legal principle in this
regard states th.a t whoever is ielaled to the deceased through a cer.tain
persoq ii.prevented from inheriitance by the.same person (except in certain
cases). Scholars unanimously agree that the molherexcludesall grandmothers
from inheritance.

How Grandmothers Inherit
Ifa grandmother is the only latrvivihg grnndll\Qther, with the absence (I.e.
death) of the motbet, she is to inherit one-sixth of the estate as previo\lSly
stated. However,'the opinion stiith1g that the grandmother, just like the mother..
is to get one-third if the decease~ has neither a, descendant heir qor twc> or
more sibling$, is irregular nnd umreliable.

V INHEIUTANCl!.

262

In ease there a,:e more tha11 one grandmother and they are on the same

level of kinship •to the deceased, they are to equally sbare one-sixth of tbe
estate as tht Prophet's Companions judged in su,:;h cases. The reason for this
is tbat they are more than onli and thati the .share ofthe grnndmotber(s), which
is one-sixth, is independent and equally divided among them, as there is no
malt heir who can sh;ire thern their one-sixt.h share of the estate. Hence, one
grandmother is equal to ma11y grandmothers in this case, just like the ruling
on the inheritance of more lhan one wife. So, none of such grandmothers is
more privileged, as they all ~tre on the same level of kinship to the deceased.
tfowever, if one of them is doser to the deceased, she is to take the one-sixth
of the l!St:lte alone, whether she is from the paternal or the maternal side.
Thus, such a grandmother prevents the otber remote gr311dmothers, as they
al) are considered mothers .sharing the $lime inheritance, so if they are more
than one but with different levels ofkinshi,p, the inheritance goes to the closest
to the deceased.
The grandmother who Ifs the father's mother is tll inherit despite the
existence of the father, and , !likewise, tbe grnad.mother who is motl1er of the
father's father is to inherit despite the,existence of the fother's father (i.e. her
sonJ; thus, sne is not e.xclud1,d by the one t!lough which she is related to the
deceased,In contrast to the rnle that states, Whoever is related to the d,~l!ased
through a certain person is prevented from inheritance by the same-person.
This Is according to the l1aditf1 narrated by lbn Mas' ud (may Allah be pleased
with him) who$nid regarding the grundmntherand her son;

"She was thefirst gtano!",otlter whom tl,e Prop!1et (PBUH) judgeil
to be gi,,e a sixth (of th,~ estate) despite tl,e fact that site /,ad ,a son
who WQs ,still ~/ive.'1·'
(Related by At-TirmidM)
The reason behind !his Is 1:hat the grandmother in this case does not replace
the one through whom she ii; related to the decen~d in inheritance, so she·is
1101. lo be prevented from inheritance in c:ase that person exists.
Shaylchul-Islam Ibn Tayn11iyah (may Allah h~ve mercy on, him) said,

"The opinion of those who 111ai11fafr1 that 'Whoever Is relaretl to 1/1~

Inheritance of Daughters
The deceased's daughter inherits half of the estate on two conditions:
The first condition: is that she is the only daughter of the deceased.
The second condition: is that the deceased does not have a son (or
sons) so that they jointly constitute agnation to the deceased.
The evidence is shown in the verse as Allah, the Almighty, says:

"Allah instructs you concerningyour children [i.e. their portions
of inheritance]: for the male, what is equal to the share of the
two females. But if there are [only] daughters, two or more,for
them is two thirds of one's estate. And if there is only one, for
her is half. . .''
(Qur1n: An-Nisa': 11)
The phrase ": .. And if there Is only one..." implies tJ1e condition that she
does not inherit half the estate unless she has no sisters (from ilie deceased);
and the phrase •~ ..for the male, what is equal to the s/sare of the two females ...''

V fNH£.R1TANCE.

implies the condition that she must have no brothers who are agnate heirs to
the deceased.

The d•ter of a late sot, of the deceased inherits
half the deceased's estate ,on three conditions:
The first condition: i,; the non-existence of n male relative to make her
,an agnate heir. namdy a brother or a son of her paternal uncle, who
.are of l11e same level p,f lr.inship to the deceased.

The second condition: is lhe non-existence of a partlcipant heir of the
deceased, namely a sftsfer or a daughter of her paternal uncle, who is of
tl\e same level of kill!;hip lo the deceased.

The third condition: is the non-existence of a descendant heir who is
higher than her in level of kinship to the deceased.

Two daughters or more inherit two-thirds
of the estate on two conditions:
The first condition: i:; that they must be 1:wo oc more.
The second condition: is the non-existence of an agnate relaliv.e of the
decease<!, namely hii: son. In this regard. Allah. Exalted be He, says:

"Al/alt instructs you ,:,mcerningyaurcliildren {i.e. their portiom
ofinl1eritance],fortl1emale, what is equal to th, shareoft/1e two
femaies. But if there .are [01,Jy].daughters, two or more, forthem
is two thirds of one~ estate..."
(Qur'au: An-Nisf: 11)
The phrase ''. ..for the mole, what is equal·to t/Je s/Jare of the two females ..."
indicates that the oon-exisle:nce of an agnate male relative is a oondition so
that daughters can ,i nherit two-thirds. The phrase •:_,But if there are [only)
t!augltkrs, two 011 more- .." ln,dicates that they must be two or more.
Sotne i.cl)olars have mistakenly understood tlJe aforementioned verse :a nd
thoughI that two daughters 2,re not to inherit two-thirds of the estate and that
they must be three daughters or more. This is the opinion adopted liy Ibo
' Aboas, unilke the majority of scholars who maintain that two d.iughters or
more are to inherit two-thirds ofthe estate. This is stated in the lladllh narrated
by J5hir Ibn • l\haulliih (may Allah be pleased with himJ as saying,

"The wife ofSa •d Ibnur-Rabl' went to the}..fessenger ofAllah (PBUH)

(Related by the Five Compilers of Haditlr exrept An-Nas.\'i :ind is

The 'l!adit/1 proves that two d,iughters are to take two.thirds of the estate
of the deceased; it is a juristic proof th~t $ett1es the dispute with regard to this
subject and a Prophetic expll1natj()JI of the verse that states, •~ .. But if tt,ere are

{011/y] daughters, two o~ more, firyr tliem is two thi.rds of one's estate..." The
h.adfth is a ,demonstration of the ,meaning, the verse, particulady because the

reason for the revelatiOB of this vi?rse
,, ls the story of the two daughters of Sa' d
1-bnur-Rab1' .and the question of'their mother regardJn~ their inheritance..
Moreover, when this verse was revealed, Che Prophet (PBUH) called their
uncle to order him to giw them tl~eir share ofest~te.
As previously stated, some sclholars are of the opinion that three or )llore
daughters. not two or more, are to, inherir two-1hird:;,of the estate, The rep!y to
this opinion can be through man:r proofs. Among them is the fact that Allah,
Exalted be He. has entitled the rrial'e to inherit a share equal to that of two
females; since a female gets one-third in case there lS'a male, whose degree of
a-gnation is higher, then, with greater reason, she ge1s one-ihird in case there
is a fem31,; like her; whose degret: is lower. It is a method of pointing out the
major by relating it to the mino!r, Allah, Exalted be He; has mentioned the
share ofone daughter literally and that of two dau_ghters by indication. Heni:e,
the phrase "... two or 11,ore..."in the aforementioned Qu r'anic verse jpdicates
that the prescribed share of daughters does not increase with their numbet,
even if they are more than two; and Allah knows best;
'fhe two daughters of lHe deceased's son are regarded as daughters of tire
deceased himself as regards inheritance (if the deceased's son il;.dead). So, they
are to be given two-thirds whethe1r they are sisters or cousins (dal1ghtecs of two
sons of the deceased) ofthe same degree of kinship to the decea~ed . Two-third~
are to be given to 1he graoddau_ghlers of the decea~ed by means of analogical
deduction., ie. considering them two daughters of the deq,ased, provided the
three following conditiolls are fulfilled:

Inheritanc:e of Full Sisters

Allah, Glorified and Exalted he He, has instructed the share of full sisters
(from the same parents) and pat,ernal half sisters with brothers who are not
from the same mother. This is stated in the following verse at the end of the
Sura of An-Nisa' (Women)':

"They request from you " (legalJruling. Say, 'Allah gives you a
ruling concerning one having neither ducendants nor ascendants
fas heirs]. Ifa man dies, ,leaving no child but [only] a sister, she
will have halfofwhat he Left. And he Inherits from her ifshe (dies
andJhas no child. But if there are two sisters [or more], they will
have two thirds of what he left. If there are both brothers and
sisters, the male will have, the share of two females ...»
(Qur'an: An-Nisft': 176)

270

V INHERJTANCf.

Allah, the AlmJghty. has also defined (be inheritance of maternal bill
sisters with muterna'\ half brothers in the following Verse:
"... And if a 1na11 or woma11 ll'avu 11either asce111Iants nor
descendants but hasa brothet or a sister, thettfer each oite oftheIn
i$ a sixth. But if they are more than two, they share a third..."

(Qur'an: An-Nisn': 12)
According to the two ven;es mentioned ;ibove, tbe full sister is t.o j:,e giveq
half of the estate provided that the following four conditions are fulfilied:

The first condition: is the non-existence of nn ngnate relatlve, namely, a
full brother. ]bis is according to the verse. "... Ifthere are both brothers
ur,d sisters, the mule will have tlie share of two females ..,"
The second condition: i6 the non-existence of a participant heir,
namely, a full sister, as Allah, EX>llted be He, says, •~--If a matt dies,
leaving no child b11t [only] o sister, slie will /,ave halfufwhat he left.
Atid he.i11huitsfro111 Jre,· ifslle {dies and] has no child. But ifthere are
two sisters [or more], they will have two thirds ofwhat he left.. !'
The third condition: 1s the non-exfstence of ascendant male heirs,
namely, a father and a paternal grandfather, according to the soundest
opinion of scholars with regard to this cnse.
T•h e fourth condition: is the non-existeace of descendant heirs,,
namely, the 60n, the grandson by thd son in descendi"ng lineage,
the daughter, r.he granddaughter by the son however fs her father in
descending lineage.

The evidence of these two conditions (i.e. the third and the fourth) is that
brothets and sisters are the heirs in the aise of the ka/dlah' which ,i& 1ke c-.isc of
the deceased having neither descendants nor ascendants (as heirs).
A paternal half sister inherits half of the estate on five conditions, four
of which are the same conditloils that govern the tnhetita.nce of a full sister
mentioned above and the fifth condition is the non-existence ofa full brother
or sister.,This is because they are stronger in their degree of kinship than the
paternal half sister.
Two or more full sisters are to inherit two-thirds as stated in t he Q ur'anic
verse, •~-. But if t/u,re au n,lo sisters [or more], theJ' wi11 have two thirds of
wlrat lte left..." However, there are four conditions that must be fulftlled so that
they can inherit the two thlrds:

The first condition: Ther should be two or more, according to the

''... If there are both brotfo~s a11d sisters, the male 'fill h!lve tl1c llrare

The fourth condition: The non-existenre of male ascendant hefrs,
who is the father ;iccord!ng to J.he coosensos of Muslim scholar$. The
male a~cendant heir in thi.s case o,ay be also the patern,ll grnndfath.er.
;1ccording to the soundest Opinion tn this regard.
'fwo paternal half sisters o,r 111orc are to inherit two-thirds as there is
a consensus that 1he verse regarding the kalalali Is.applicable to them
''. .. If a man dies, ieavlng 110 cllild but [only] a sister, she will l,ave
half of what he left. And lte inl,erils from lter ifshe {dies and) has n(I

of what he left..." (Qur'rui.: An°Nisn': 1.76) However, they are. not t o
be given the two-thirds unless 1hey fulfill five cnndition6: the first four
conditions are the same like the previously mentioned conditions
regarding the inheri.t ance ()f full sisters.

The fifth condition: is the 1,on-exislence of full sislern or full brothers.
Hence, if there is one or more full sister or brother, the paternal half
s/s.ters are not ro inherit two-thirds. They are 16 be excluded from the.
fnheritance by the e:,cistenoe ofa CuU brother or two foll sisters unless they
have an agnare relative. However, if it ·is only one full sister, tb~ paternal
half sister(s) is to be given t>oe•sixth lo complete the hvo-thirds.
In case there is only a daughti:r and one or more granddaughters by the
son, the daughter is to lake a half and the grnnddaughter(s) by the son is to
take one-sixth as the remainder of the two-thirds. This was the verdict of rbn
M'as· Od (may AUah be pleased witlh l'iim) in such a case as he said:

In case there is a daughter (of the deceased) or more, with one or more full
or paternal half sisters (of the deceased), the existing daughter(s) whether one
or more is/are to be given her/thei1r prescribed share. However, the majority of
scholars from amongst the Companions and the Successors of the Companions
believe that full sisters or paternal half sisters form an agnate relation with the
daughters. This is what the scholars of inheritance call "agnation with other
relatives.• Thus, they are to be given whatever remains from the prescribed
share of the daughters or son's daughter. This is il.lustrated in the hadith related
by Al-Bukhari and other compiler.s of H.adith that states:

of kal{llah is: the one who dies leaving Qeither· ascendanis :nor
descendants; thus, the non-existeaceof ascendants and descendants
is a ,condition in such a case. The descendants indude the male and
the female children aud grandchildren (children of the deceaseds
&op) and so.forth in desce11ding lineage, and the .ascendants Tud\'lde
the father aod the paternal grandfather and so forth in desc:ending
lineage. As ~ ptoof that there is no preference for the mal·e over the

has entitled them to share the inheritance togelher, ;ind the sharing
indicates tha! each one is given an equal share. The wisdom behind
tliis, Allah knows best, is that they are rel~tives on the maternal side
only, and they all are the same with regard t(l this. Hence-, there is
.no preference for the male over the female in contrast to kinship
through the paternal side.

The third ruling: The male sibling.is related to rhe deceased thro4gh a
female relative (i.e. his mother), yet he still has the right to inherit in
contras! to others who do not Inherit if the ,relation to the deceased is
through a female such as the case of a son of a daughter.
The fouri.h ruling:They partially exclude whoever caused their relation
to the deceased and decrease his share (11amely the mother in this
case), Therefore, the mother's share of the estate in this case de,;rea,ses
from one-third to ome-sixth, ' as she is the cause of their relationship

to the deceased. 'Ihiis rulihg comes in contrasr wilh !he general rule
which states tllat whoever is related to the \lece-Jse\l through a certain
person is prevented from inheritance hy the same person.
Tbe fifth rulingi They inherit with the one through whom they are
related 10 l:he dece.ased, i.e. r.beir mother, while this is not the case
normally. for example. th~,5on's child (male or female) is nol to inherit
with the son. How,:ver, the paternal grandmother (Le. the mother
of .i folher, the mother of the p3ternal grandfulher and so forth in
nsoending llneage) resembles the maternal ~iblings in t!iis ruling, as
she is related to the dee.eased througb her son, and yet she still has the
right to inherit, despiite the ell.istence of her son.
To conclude, whoever is rel,1ted 10 the deceased lhrough a certain person
is not prevented from inhe,ilartce by tlie same person unless the latter replaces
the former in inheritance. Hlowever, if the latter does not replace the former.
then there is no exclusion. 'l'his is as in the case of mmernal siblings; they do
not inherit the share of the mother in case of her non-existence. Sf1pilady,
the patemal J!raodmotl1et (mother of the forhet or mother of rhe paternal
gr3ndfather and so forth in ascending lineage) does not take the father's or the
paterna l g,randfather's shares, but she is to lnherit with any of them hy virtue of
motherhood l'n aase of\hemothe,'s uo,1-~stence; and Allah k11ows besl.

Agnation
Agnation linguistically in Arabic refers to the meaning of supporting.
In the rules of inheritance, the word refers to one's agnate celative(s). Thus,
the agnate relatives of a person are his relatives from the paternal side: the
father, the son, the (full or paternal half) brother and the father's (full or half
paternal) brother. According to the laws of inheritance, the agnate relative is
the person who gets an undefined share, because if he is alone without any
other claimants to the inheritance, he gets the whole estate. However, jf he is
not alone, he is to get what remains after the prescribed shares of inheritance
are distributed. This is according to the lladitl, of the Prophet (PBUH):
"Give the shares of the inheritance (prescribed in the Quriln) to
those who are entitled to receive them. Then whatever remains
should be given to the closest male relative of the deceased."'

Agnation is divided into three categories: being an agnate relative by
oneself, being an agnate relative by other relatives, and being an agnate relative
with other relatives.

V INHERITANCE

280

The First Ca~gory: A1gnation by Onesetl
This category includes ;111 males co11cerni11g whom !here is a conseusus
that they are entitled to inherit except the husband and the maternal half
brother. Those who are agnate relatives by themselves are fourreen: The son,
the son's male child and so forth in descending lineage, the father, the paternal
grandfather ana so forthin~1scending lineage, the full brother and the p aternal
half brother, the son of a full brother or the paternal halfbcother and so forth
in descending lineage, the !father's full brother and the father's paternal half
btothet and so forth in asci:ndi11g !i11eage, the sQn of a full or a half-p,i,temal
uncle and so forth in descending lineage. (f also includes fhe mamimitter, male
or fomafe, of a slave' .

The Second Category:: Agnation by Othei: Relatives
Th.is category indt1des f,our groups:

l · One or mor~ daughters of the deceased with one or more sons (lf the
deceased.
2-Thedaughter{s)of!h,edeceased'sson'swithoneormoreofthedeceased's
son's male· children, provided that he should be at the same level of
kinship with her wh,ether he is her brother or her paternal cousin. She
could also be an agnate relative by the grandson who is lower than her
in the level of kinship to the deceased. The evidence that these two
groups are categori,es of being an 11gnate relative by other relatives is
shown in the noble verse in which kllah, Exalted be He, says:
·~/lalt'in$tructsyou,concer11/ngyour children [i.e. tl,eir portions
of inheritance]: for the male, what is equal to the share of tlte
two females ..."
(Quran: An•Nisa': U)
This noble verse coinsider-S the children and the son's grandchildren.

3· One or more full sii.ter of the deceased with one or more full brothet·
ofthe deceased.
4 - One or more paternal half siSler of the deceased with one or more

paternal half brother of the deceased. The evinence. regarding the last
two groups ts show,a h1 the verse that reads:

"... if ihere are bot/, brothers 1111d sisters, the male will have the
shMe oftwofemale,s...;,

(Qutln; An-Nis~•: 176)

Chaprer 12: A_gnatiun

The verse <onsiders full siblings- and paternal side half siblings, Thus, the
sisters of-the following male relatives of the d~ceased are io inherit by virtue
of agnation by them: the deceased's son, fhe deceased's son's male child, (h,e
deceased's fa.I! brother and the dec:eased's paternal half brother, However, the
sisters ofc;ither male relatives of the deceased do not share them in inheritance,
5Uch as sister.s of the deceased's male nephews, the sister's of the deceased's
paternal uncles_,and tl1e sister's of the deceased~ paternal cousins.

The Third Category: Agnation with Other Relatives
This category is divided Into two kind5:
1- One or more full sister of the deceased with one. or more daughter of
the deceased or with one o>r more of the deceased's son's daughter.
2--0ne or moce paternal halfsister ofthe deceai;ed with one ot more daughter
of the dee.eased or with one or more of the deceased's son's daughter.
Tp,is is the opinio11 of the majority of ~cholers from amongst the Companions of tl\e Prophet (PBUH}, the Successors of the Companions, and
those who came after them. 'f hey i:ay that the full. sisters.and the paternal half
sisters of t·h e deceased become agnate relailves with the deceased's daughters
or the decea~s sons daughters, The evidence is illustrated ill the· h,adith
that states:

'½ba Mflst!i (may Allah be pl,t:ased wrrh him) 'YilS asked regarding
(the inheritance of) a daughter, a, son'.1 daughter, and a, sister,
He said1 'The daughter is l'o take one-half and the sister is to
take one-half. Abtl 1\.1usa added, 'Go to tbn Mas' ad and he
will tell you the same.' lbn Mas 'ud was asked and was told of
Abtl MOS/is "erdi"t. Ibn Mus' ud then said, '(If I give the same
verdict,) I woukl striry and would not be of the right[j,,guided,
The verdict I will give in thl.s case will be the same as that of the
Prophet (PBUH); one-half Isfor the daughter, one-sixth for the
so11s daughter so that both shares make two-thirds of the total
estate, and the rest isfor the sister.' "'
~Related by the Group of Compilers- of Hadith ' except lmdm
Muslim and An-N'asi\'t)
Th.e agnate relative by oneself[[els the whole estate ifbe is alone, as Allah,

Only the agnate relative by oneself enjoys,such a ruling, but such an aguate
relative shares the rest of agnate relatives in inheriting what remains after the
prescribed shares of inheritance are distribute\1- This is based on the iladith
qf.the Prophet (PBUH);

Howeve1; if nothing remains after !he legal heirs take their prescril:ied
shares, the agnate relatives Inherit nothing,
There are six sides for the agnate rel;itions; they are respectively as follows:
filiation, paternity, brotberhood, brother's sons, relationship of the paternal
unde; and w1.1!tl', '' which is -as mentioned before- caused by the favor the
manum1tter does for the manumitted. The following 1Iad1th of the Prophet
(PBUH) illustrates this as be says:

"Verily, the wa/11' is for thr emancipator:"'
(Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
In case two or more agna(e relatives are Involved, they have one of the
foUo'l'ing four cases,·
Tbe first case:•They may share the same agnntion side, the .sami' ievel of
ltinship, :ind the degree ofkinship. In this case, they share the inheritance
together suc;h as the sons, the full brother&and p11tern.al nncles.
The second case: They may differ in their agnation side oniy. Thus, the
one having the closest side of kinship l1as the priority in it1heritance
(according to the above-mentioned order), such as the case of a son
and a father. In this case, tbe son !\as more priority than the father
by agnation.
The third case: They may share rhe same agnation .side and differ in the
lrvel ofkinshlp such as the case with the son and the son's male child.
In this case, the son has the priority over the grandson, as he is closer to
the deceased in the level ofkit1ship.

The fo11rth case: '!'.hey may share I he same agnation side arid level
of kinsl~ip but dif(er in the degree of kinship so that 011e of them is
stronger in degree 1ban the other. In this case, the one l\aving the
strongest degree of kinshi,p will have the priority such as li full brother
with a paternal halfbroth,er. Thus, the full brothev bas the priority over
the paternal n~lf brother, as the full brother is related to the deceased
through the two parents while the paternal half'brother is rel;ited to
the deceased through the father only.

CHAPTER

Prevention from Inheritance

(Hajb)

This chapter has a specific importance among the rulings on inheritance
because knowing its details will help assign rights to those deserving them.
On the contrary, unawareness of the rulings on such an issue may cause great
harm, as the inheritance might be given to those who are not legal heirs while
depriving the right persons from it. Therefore, some scholars say,

"It is prohibited for those who do not know the rulings on prevention (hajb) to give a fatwa concerning a matter of the rules of
inheritance."
According to the scholars ofinberitance, "hajb" means preventing someone,
who is entitled to inherit, partially or totaUy, from receiving all his/her share of
inheritance (according to the relevant rulings) .

V INHE(VTANCE

286

Ptet<ention from inhei:itance is divided .into two categories:
The First Category: Pt:evention by Description
·rhis means that someor1e is characlerizeJ by something that causes him
to be totally prevented from inheritance. The three reasons that cause one to
be totally prevented from inheritance ate: being a slave, being a murderer, or
being o( a difrerent religion than !hat of th!!" deceased. Those who i\ave any
of these characteristics do hot inherit, and their eXistence or non-existence
{l'l.!k.es no difference [n this regard,

The Second Category~Prevention by Persons
This means that a specific person is either excluded from the inneritance
altog~Lber and this is caUed "complete prewntion': or that this person is
prevented from receiving a bigger share of 1he inheritance but allowed to
receive a smaller one, and Ibis is called "partial prevention''. The reason for
this category of prevention i!, I.he existence ofa person who is more entitled to
that loheritance than the oni, prevented, and that is why itis called "prevention
by persons". This cntegory is dlvided Into seven types, four of which occur as a
,result of the presence of mnn1y different Kinds ofleg,I] heirs and the other three
occur due lo the transitlon from one srate to11notheras a result ofthee1tistence
of other heirs. These seven l'ypcs arc ns follows,

First: The transition from one type of a prescribed share to a lower one,
64Ch as ,the alteration of the husband's share from a half lo a quarte-r,
Second: The transitio,o from oae category of agn.ation to another 011e
that is lowe1~ such a~ the alteration of the (full or 't he paternal t'lalf)
sister from be.ing an agnate with other relatives to being an agnate by
other relatives,
Thjrd; 1'he tr.1nsitio11 from being entitled toa prei;cribed share to a category
ofagoation lower tham the prescribed share, such as the alte ration of the
female heir from beilng entftled to Inherit n holf as a prescribed _share to
being an agnnte by other relatives.

Fourth: TJ\ e 1-ransitiwo from being entitled to inherit by agna!ion to
inherit a smaller pre:scribed share, such ~s the alteration of µ,;e father
or the paternal gra11dfother from the inheritance by Virtue of agoation
to the Inheritance b)' virtue of a pret;crlbed share.

Fifthi.Tl\e increase in the.number uflq;al heirs to II particular prescribed
share, s1Jch as the increa'ie in I.he aurober of wives sharing the same
one-fourth or one-eighth of the estate.

Sixth; The increase in tlie .number of legal heirs ln agnation, such as the
increase of agnate heirs fa sharii1g the whole estate or the remainder
after distributing the prescribed shares.

Sevent)JrThe increase in the au1t1ber of legal heirs as a result dtlie •awl,

1

such as the iacrease·ofthe·numbero(those entitled to prescribed shares
in cases orthe '11111/. Thus, each one of these legal heir-sis to take his legal
share reduced in amounlas a result of this increase.

Prevention is governed by some rules as follows:
The first rule: Whoever is related to the deceased through a c~i\uin
person is prevented from inheritance by the same person (bearing in
mind what has been previously mentioned in this regard), such as.the
case ofa 6on's ma le child with the son, the maternnl grandmother with
the 01,;,ther, the paternal grandfuther with fbe father, and brothen wilh
tbe father.
The-second rule: 1n case lWn or more agnnteheics are involved, the ouc
who is closer in the o.gnation sid'e will have the· priority in inheritance.
Hence, if there is a son and a father or a paternal grandfather, Lhe
agnation is claimed to the soa as he is ofthe closest side. I11 case they
both sh~e. the same agnatiou side, the closer one to the deceased has
the priority over the other, as in the case of a son and a son's male
child, or the case of a ful1 brother and the son of another fuU brother,
ancl .so forth. If the relatives involved are equal in their ognution 5ide
and level to the deceased, the one of the stronger degree of kinship has
the priority in inheritance, such as in the case of a foll brother and a
paternal half brother. In this case, the foll brother hos the priority over
the paternal half brother, as the full brother is related to the deceased
through the two parents while· the paternal half brother ls- related to
the deceased through the father only.
The thir~ rule: This rule concerns the complete prevention. An
ascendant he.ir is not to be prevented from t h!! inheritance except by
-another ascendant heir. For example, n paternal _grandfather is Qlll)'
prevented by a father or another- paternal grandfathe.r wh9 is closer

V INHERfl'ANCE

288

to the deceased. Also, 11 grandmother cannot be prevented except
by a mother Or another grandmother who is closer to the deceased.
Likewise, a descendant heir ls not to 6epreventedf rom the inheritance
except by another descendant heir. For example, a son's male child
is 6nly prevented by a son or another grandson of a 'higher level of
kinship. In addition. the collateral relntives, namely the brothers and
their sons, and the palernai uncles and their sons, may be prevented by
ascendant h_eirs, descendant heii;,s or collateral relatives. For example,
the paternal half brothers o( the deceased are prevented from the
inheritance by the deceased's son, a deceased's son's male ch!ld, 11nd
so furth in descending lineage. They are also prevented by the father
oftbe deceased or the deceased's paternal grandfather (and so forth in
asceodong lineage), according to the soundest opinion Of scholars in
this regard. Moreovei-, the paternal half brother(s) is prevented from
inheritanc;e by a full brother and a full sistec if she Is an agnate relative
with another relative. Thus, the paternal ,half brother; as illustrated, is
prevented by ascendant, deso:mdant and collateral .relatives.
Again, it is important to stress that the issue ofprevention from inberitance
(llajb) is very important; therefore, whoever is assigned to givefatwa regwding
the rules ofinheritance. should be completel'y well-versed in lts ruling and even
apply them practically lest he should give a wrong fatw,1 and consequently
change 1.1\e legal rulings of inher1tance and deprive the legal heirs from their
rights. And Allah is the One Who grants success.

Inheritance of Siblings' with the
Paternal Grandfather

With regard to this case, Imam Ahmad, Imam Ash-Shafi· t and Imam
Malik adopted the opinion stated by Zayd Ibn Thabit ( may Allah be pleased
with him). Also, Abu Yusuf and Muhammad Ibnul-Hasan, the two Disciples
of Imam Abu Han!fah, as well as many of the men of religious knowledge have
adhered to this opinion.

According to this opinion, there are three cases of the siblings

existing with the paternal grandfather:
I-They may be full siblings.
2-They may be paternal half siblings.
3-They may include both types, full siblings and paternal half siblings.

V INHJlRITANCE

290

In this respect, if the siblings with the paternal grandfather are either full
or.paternal half siblings, the grandfather l\as t\vo cases with them:

the first case: When there is no other heTr by virtue of prescribed share. to
such 1! case. there are three cases for the paternal grandfather-as follows:
A) When the m11qasmna/1 ' entitles the paternal grandfather to get
more than one-,third of the estate: The criterion of this case is that
the siblings' share is less than double the. paternal grandfather's share
For example, their share can be equal to one and a half of the paternal
gnindfather's share or less than thnt. 'Fhis case involves five forms:.
J • The deceased's paternal grandfather and one sister of the deceased;
in this case. the paternal grandfather gels lwo-tbirds of the estate.

2-The p11temol grandfather on.d one brother; in this case, the g111ndfather gets one-halfof the estate.
3- The paternal gtaodfatber and two sistan;; in this case, he gets J1alf
the estate (similar to the second form) which is-more th'lll one•third.
4- The paternal grandfuther arid lhree sisters; in this .case, he gets twofifths, which nre more than one-thitd.
5- The pa1ernal grandfather and one'brother and one sister; in this
case, th.e grandfather get6 two-fifths, just like lhe fonrth case.
B) When the paternal grandfather gels one-third of the estate, whether
through the m11qtuamal1 or not. The crilerion of this case is lhat the
~iblings' share is double the palemal grandfather's share. This case
involves three forms.
1• The deceased's paternal grandfather and two-brothers
2· '.T.h e paternal grnndfotherand one brother and two sisters
3- The paternal gr.1ndfather aod four s.isters
Tn these forms, !he paternal grandfatl1e,r gets one-lhird of the estate,
whether through the 111,"lasamah or not. With regard to this issue, there
is disagreement among scliolars, whether the paternal grandfather
is to receive his share. which is one-third, lhtou_gh the m11q6.;11mflh
as an agnate relative or receive it as a prescribed share, or that he lsto be given the option to receive it through either of the two Ways.
Some scholars give preponderanc~ lo the opinion that the paternal
grandfathe.r is to receive one-third of the estate as a prescribed share·

Chap,cr 14.: lnhfri,anC'<'ofSiblings wi,h die P:uemal GJ;1JJdfather

rather than them.11qasam11h. TI1lsis because con~idering the preScribed
share, 19heaever possible, Js worthier, for the prestribed slrar~ bas
In ore consideration. Moreover, those ei1tllled to prescribed shares are
given prepoaderanoe to the agnate relatives. Arid Allah, Exalted be He,
knows best.
C) When one•third of the estate yields more than the share that the

palem al grandfather will get through the rnuqasa111al1. ln this case,
.the pa111.n ial gr;\lldf.ith.er ,g~Js one-third. of the estal<: as a prescribed
share. This is when lhe siblings' share is more -than double his share.
Rowever, there are no llinlted fonns for such a case, unlike the two
previous cases. The least number io such. a case 1s the existence of the
deceased's paternal grandfather and two bmthersaod one sister, otthe
paternal grandfather and five sisters, or tlie patern;il grandfath~r an..t
one brother and three sisters, and upward.
Th.e second case: When there is one entitled to. a prescribed share
besid'es the- deceased's p~temal grandfather and siblings. There are
seven cases for the paternal grandfath.er-as follows:
A,- }le is to get his share throqgh the muqasamah

B- He is to get oae-thm:l of the remaiodet of the estate (after tbe
prescribed .shares are distributed)

C- He is to,get one-sixth of the estate
D- When h.is share thrnugh the muqasamah is equai to one-third of
the remainder
E-When Wt; sha.re thro11gh the m11qasama/i is equal to one-sixth ofthe
estate·
F-When his prescribed one-sixth oftlre estate is equal to one-third of
the remai nd'e r
G- When his share through the muqasamah is ,equal to one-sixtft of
the esrateas well as one-thtrd of the remainder
To tackle these ·cases in detail, they are.as follows:
A· The paternal grandfathe1· is to get his share through the muqasamah
when his share through the m11qiisamah is more than one-third of the
remahidet of the estate (after lhe prescribed shares are distribu1ed)
as well as one-slxth of the estate. }\n example of this case is when ,the
c.lece~sed has 1efr • husband, a paternal grandfather, and one brother.

292

V lNHERffANCE.

That is, when the p,·estribed share amounts to half the estate (that
goes to the husband) and the siblings' share i.s less than double the
paternal grandfather''s share.
In this case, the pate:mal grnndfuther is to gel his share through the
muqasamah as the re:mainder of the estate is one-half, after giving onehalfto the husband Tb is remaining halfis to be equally divided between
the paternal grandfather and the brod\cr (due to the muqasamah). No
doubt that one-fourth of the estate is more than either one-third of the
remainder or one-sixth of the estate. Thus, the estate is to be djvid~d 115
follows: one-half is for the husband as a prescribed share, one-fourth
is for the paternal grandfather, and one-fourth ls for the brother. This
can be illustrated in I he following table:

B- The paternal graudfather is· to gef oue-third of the remainder of the
estate (after the pres1:rihed shares are dtstributed). This is when onethird of the rcmail1d et is more than the share received through ihe
muqdsamah and mor·e than one-sixth of the estate as well An example
of sucn a case is when .the deceased has left a 111other, a paternal
grandfather and five !brothers, and suchlike cases when the prescribed
share is less than half the estate (namely one-s1xth, wl1ich goes to the
mother 1n this case) an.d that the siblings' share is more than double
the paternal grandfather's share.
The paternal gr;mdJiather gets one-third of the remainder of the
estate {after the mother get~ her prescribed share, namely one-sixth)
in this case as the re,naining five sixths are to be distributed among
the paternal grandfather and the five brothers. Sn, the paternal
grandfather gets one,-tlllid.of the five-sixth$ that equals ( 1½) aud the
five brothers take the other two rhirds ofthe five-sixths. Undoubtedly,
the one-third of the remainder going to the paternal gr.andfather is
more than the share )tie would have gol through the muq4samah and
'1lso more than one--sixth of the est.ate. However, one-third of the

CIJ•p<er 14: lnherirante of Sibling., wtch ,he, Porern,I Grnpdfacher

293

rema,'ining five-siicth is not ,1 natural numbe1; Therefore, for easier
calculations, we can get the common denominator by multiplyiqg 3
by 6 and deal with case as an 18-share estate. Thus, the motber gets
her prescribed share (one•bixth) that equals three shares, 1.e. 3/18.
The paternal grandfather gets one-third of the remainder, which
eqµals five shares, i.e. 5/18. The five brothers get the other two thirds
of the remalllder, i,e. 10/18; each gets two shares. ie. 2/18. This can
be shown in the following table:

''I'he vatern,1] gran.dfather is to get one-sixth of the estate in this case
as the husband gets one'•half of the estate, the mo thee gets ,one-sixth,
and the remaining third of the estate go to the two brothers and the
paternal grandfather. Undoubtedly, the one-.sixth that goes to the
paternal grandfather is more than one-third of the remainder and
11lso more than the share he would have got through the muqilsamah.
However, dividing the remaining one-sixth of the estate is not a
natural number. Therefore. for easier calculations, we can get the
common denomin:,,tor by multiplying 2 by ,6 and deal with c;;se as
a 12-share estate. Thus. the husband gets bis one-ba)f of the estate,
namely six shares, i.e: 6/12, The mother gets one-silcth of .t he estate
w'hich is two shares, i,e, 2/l:2. The paternal grandfather-gets one-sixtb
of the estate as weJJ. which is two shares, i,e. 2/ l 2. The two brothers

example of this case is when the deceased has left a mother, paternal

prescribed shares are less than half the estate and the siblings' share is
double th¢ share of the paternal graudfather.
The paternal grandfother's share through the muqlisamah is equal to
one-third of the rem:a.inder of the estate in this case as the mother gets
her one-sixth as a prescribed share and the remaining five--sixths go
to the paternal grandfather and the two brothers. The one-third of the
remainder equals (I½), which is equal to the paternal grandfather's
share through them uqtisamah. However, one-,third of the rell)aioder
is not o natural niunlbet Therefore, for easier calculations, we can get
the cor11moo deno,niin~tor by multiplying 3 by 6 and deal wirh case as

prescribed sbate, which is (3118). Tbe paternal grandfather gets five
shares (5/18) either through the muqdsamah or as one-rhird of the
remainder. The rwo brothers get ten shares (10/18); five shares (5/18)

The paternal grandfather's share through the muqasamah is equal to
one-sixth of the e.~tate in 1:his case as the husband gets one-half of the

and the three brotherssha,·e the other hat£ 1n this case, one-sixth of the
estate is equal to one-third of the remai nder. However, one-third of the
remainder is not a natural number. Therefore, for easier calculations,
we can get the common deaonunator by maltiplying 2 by 3 and dei>I
with case as a 6-share esta:te. Thus. the husband gets three shares, le.
one-half of the estate; (3/6), In the b,une way, we get another common
denominator by multiplying 3 by 6 and deal with the whole case a§
an is-share estate. Accordjng)y, the.husband gets half the estate (nine
sliare$) -as a prescribed share, namely (9/18), the paternal grandfather
gets three shares (3/18), arid the three brothers get the other sixshai;es

(afteFthe prescribed shares are distributed). An example of this case
is when the deceas<Jd has left is a husband, a paternal grandfather
and two brothers, and suchlike cases in which the: prescribed shares
equal half the estate and the siblings' share is double that of the
paternal grandfatlwr.
The paternal grandfather's share through the muqtlsamah is equal to
one-sixth of the estate as well as one-third,of the remainder in thfs case
as the husband gets half the estate and the remaining half goes to the
paternal granMather and the two brothers. Thu6, the one-third of the
remainder, the paternal grandfather's share through the muqasamah
and the one-sixth ot the estate are all equal HowC!Vef, one-third of the
remainder is not a natural number. Therefore, for easier calculations,
we can get the common denominator by multiplying 2 by 3 and deal
with case as a 6-share. estate. So, the hu6baod gets three shares (3/6),
which represent half the estate, the paternal grandfather gets one share
(1/6) and the two brothers get tbe remaining two shares (216); one for
each. See the following !able;

Note
As for the remainder of the estate after the: prescribed shares are disttib•
uted, there are four cases for· the paternal grandfather:
(1) If the remainder is; more than one-tixth of the estate, the paternal
grandfather gets the largest share <;>f the three alternatives, namely the
m11qM/11rtl!lt, one-third of the remainder or one-sixth of the estate.

Chapter 14: lnhcriraucc ofSJbUaJ.lS widuhe Paternal Grandfuchcr

297

(2) 1f I.he remainder equals one-si.uh of the estate, then it goes to the
paternal grandfather as a pre~cribed share.
(3) If the remainder is less than one-si.xtl\ of fhe estate, tile paterpal
grand(athec is entitled tp get one-sixth of the estate as a prescribe3
share, and so the case is subject to the rufes of ·awl',
(4.) 1f there is nothing left for the paternal grandfather after dividing lhe
prescribed shares, then the paterpal grandfather is entitled to get onesixth of the ei;tale as o prescribed share.,and so the case i6 s1.1bject t'O !he
rules of 'awl, as in the former case.

In tbe last three cases,.the siblings have no shares, except for the sister in
the case called the Akdariyyah' on which we will elaborate later' .

Note
tn some ·cases, the paternal grandfather gets one-third of the remainder
by analogy with \'.he mother in the two cases known as the •Umariyyatem

(the iwo rulings attributed to ' Umar fbnul-Khattl\b). This is because both
the paternal graodfalher and the mother are considered ascendants of the
deceased. On the other band, if there is no a legal heir entitled to prescr1bed
shares. each of the paternal granc\falher- and the mother geb one-third of
the estate.

If there is a legal heir entitled to prescribed shares, tbe paternal grandfather
gets one-third of the remaioder aod the remaining pa.rt goes to the sibliqgs.
Wheo lhere are siblings, tlie paternal gr:andfalher is not to receive one-third
of ~e estate,,as this will cause harm to tile shares of the siblings. The paternal
grandfather gets one-sixth as he does not get less thart one-sixth despite the
existence of the deceased's son(s), who is the most entitled inheriting heirs.
Hence, with greater reasoo, the paternal grandfatbtlr's share does not decrease
with oth~r heirs' .

CHAPTER

The Mu' addah'
What has been previously discussed, namely the inheritance of the paternal
grandfather besides the siblings, is related to the cll$e of the existence of only
one type of siblings, either full siblings or paternal half siblings. As for the Cll$e
when there are a paternal grandfather, full siblings and paternal half siblings,
then the full siblings count their paternal half siblings in their favor against the
paternal grandfather to decrease his share. Then, after the paternal grandfather
takes his share, the full siblings take the share of the paternal half siblings, if
there is only one full sister existing, she gets her prescribed share in full and
the remainder goes to the paternal half siblings.
Thus, the full sibling counts the paternal half sibling against the paternal
grandfather, as they both types of siblings share the same father, and that the
side of the mother of the full siblings is blocked by the existence of the paternal
grandfather. So, the full sibling counts the paternal half sibling against the
paternal grandfather to decrease the latter's share in case he gets it through the
muq~samah so that he gets at most one-third of the estate, or one-third of the
remainder of the estate, or one-sixth of the estate.

V !NHERITANCE.

Another reason behind the mu· Md11h is that the ·full siblings aod the
paternal half siblings are equally related to the paternal grandfather, as they
all are his son's children. Thus, the paternal half siblings are,considered in the
division of the estate, wbich is not in favor of the paternal grandfather. After·
the pater!l1ll grandfather's share decreases (due to the existence of.the·patetnal
half siblings), the full siblings block the paternal balf siblings and take ·their
shal'e, as if there is no paternal grandfather'.

When is the Mu 'adddh Considered?
This method is effected when the full siblings· share less than double the
paternal grandfuthet's share, and that the remainder after cllstributing the
prescribed shares ls more than one-fourth of the estate. But if the siblings'
share i.s equal lo do,,;ble tile ·paternal grandfather's share or more, then there
will no n~ed to apply the mu 'addak

The Forms of the Mu 'iiddah:
There are sixty-eight cases in which the method oftbe 11111 '<idda/1 '1s applie<i
The reason for restricting the forms of the 11111 •add.ah to such a number is
that the- full siblings' share must be less than double the paternal grandfather's
share.- There are orily five forms in this regard, and they are as follows:

0 A paternal grandfather and one full sister
2) A paternal grandfathet' and two full sisters

.3) A paternal grnndfather and three full sisters
4) A paternal grandfather and one full brother

5) A paterna1 grandfather and one full brother aod one full sister
These five forms may involve paternal half siblings 80 lhat the siblings'
share may teach do11ble the share of the paternal grandfather or less.
I ) A paternal grandfather and one full sister: This forw involves

five possible cases as follows:
• One full sister·and a paternal half sister
• Oote full sister ~n<l iwo paternal half sistet,s
• One full sister and three paternal halfsisters
• One full sister and a paternal half brother
• Orie full sister and a patel'nal half brother and a paternal half Sisler

Chapter 15: The Mu· Jddah

:IOI

2) A paternal grandfatheJ' .ind two full sisters: This form involves
three posSJble cases as follows:
• Two full si~ters and a paternal half sister
• Two full sisters and two paternal half sisters
• Two full sisters and a paternal half brother
3) A pater_pal gr-.1.!ldfather and three full sisters: This fonn involves
only one possible asc:

• Three full sisters and one paternal half sister.
4) A pateroal gtandfa~e_r and one full brother: Tli~ form involyes
three possible 9<1ses as follows:
• One full brother and one paternal halfsister
• 0!'le full brother and two paternal half sisters
• 011e full b(Other and one )?aterual half brother
·5) A paternal grandfathCI' and one full brother and one full sister: This
form involves one possible case:
• On~ full brother and one full sister a1;1d a eaternal half sister:
The above-mentioned ar~ thirteen c;is11s, all of whkll may or may not
ir1du\le. lega'I hefts who arB entitled to prescribed shares. In case the.re are
heirs ,entitled to prescribed shares, their prescnbed shares may be one of the.
following:
►

One-fourth

> One-sixth
► One-fourth and one-sixth
► One-half

By adding. the case that does not include an ho,ir entitled to a prescribed
share, they become five cases. When jhese five cases are multiplied by- the
thirtei;n PlSl!S mentioned !lhovi;, the 19\;µ cases are sixty-five.

AB for the sixty-sixth c;ase. it involves a paternal grandfather, stbl'iqgs, and
rwo heirs whose pre.~cribed shares are one-half and one-sixth of the esfate foe
e11oh. An example of thi$ case is tf1e following:

V lNI-IEJµT'ANCE

302

• A paternal g,randfuther, oue daughter, a son's daughter, one full sister,
and one paternal half sister.
As regards the sixty-seventh case, lt involves prescribed heirs who
inherit two-thirds oftile estate along with the sibl1Jlgs and the paternal
grandfather. This can be illustrated by fhe foliowjng example:
• ·A paternal grandfather, two daughters. one foll ~ister and paternal
half si~ter.
As for the sixty-eighth case, n~mely the l~stone,'it includes two prescribed
heirs enotled to one-half and one-eighth of the est.ate, along wld\ the
siblings and the paternal grandfather, such as the following case:

• A paternal grandfathe.r, one daughter, a wife, one full sister, and one
paternal half sistet

Is there any possibility that the paternal half siblings get any share
aloog with the full siblings in tase of the mu •addalt?

tf the full siblings include a male brother, or two ot more full sisttrs, then
there is no possibility that the pa!ernal half siblings can get any shate of the
.estate. However, if there is Gnly one full sister, s11e gets her full share even if
it reaches half the estate (as p(eviously mentioned), and if there is something
left, it goes to the paternal half siblings.
Among the cases in which there is 60roething ihat may 'b e Jeft for the
1?<1lernal balf'siblings are the four cases judged by Zayd lbn 'f'1Af>it, so they are
called the Four Zayrli Cases. They are as follows:
1- The •Ashriyyalt (i.e.. using-a common denominator of 10; decimal):
This case includes a paternal grandfather, one fuU slster, nnd one
palernal haif brother. Though the.,e persons are entitled to take five
shares of the estate, it 1s called 'Asliriyy~/1-, for a common denominator
oflb is considered in order to reach a natural numbers.

111e reason ot co11sidering a common de1\orninator of 10: The full
sister is entitled to take half tbe estate; bowevec, \:here is no integer
nwnber resrilting when dividing the number 5 (shares). In order to
seule this issue, (2) is to be multiplied by'S (the nwnber of share.,) rhar
ends up as 10 shares. Thus, the paternal grandfat.her gets two-fifths (4
sliares), the full sister gets half(S share~). the paternal halfbrothet gets
the remain ing one share. See the following table:

2- The 'lshri11iyyall (Le. tl1e case depending on using a common
denominator 20): This iis when there are a paternal grandfath_er,
one foll sister and two ]paternal half sisters. So, the principle of
division is· 5 (the iiumbe r of shares, bearing in mind that a male's
share equals that of two fomales), similar to the above case. That is,
the paternal grandfather gets two shares through the muqasamah,
and the full sl~ter gets half the estate. However, tbere is no integer
resulting from dividing five shares by 2 to give the full sister Her
prescribed hall Tberefor~,, for easier. calculations, is to be multfplied
by 5 (the number of shaires), which results in 10 shares. So, the
paternal grandfather gets four shares (2 X 2 4), and the full sister
gets holf the estate, namely five shares. After that, there is one share
left that goes to the two paternal half sisters and it is to be equally
divided between them. However;. there is no integer by dividing
such remaining share,. so 2 is to be multiplied by the 10 (the first
common denominator in this case) that results in twenty (the new
common denominator). In this way, the paternal grandfather's
share is eight shares (4X.2 8), and the ful l sister's share is ten shares
(5X2 10). Then, the two paternal half sisters gei the remaining two
shares (2Xl 2), i.e. one share for each. Th~s can be illustrafed in the
following table:

Moreover, this issue can lbe settled by following another method..
There are five shares: the r•aternal grandfather receives two through
the muqdsamah, the full sister gets half the estate, namely (2½)
sbares. Thus, the.re is only a half share (1/.2 share) remaining for the
two paternal half sisters, S() each of the two half sisters gets a fourth

V JNHER.LTANCE

sii!ll'e (1/4 share). 111 order to avoid fractions, 4 ls multiplied by 5
(the number of shares) that re.~ults in 20 shares (Le. using 20 as a
c-ommon denominator). The paternal grandfather .gets eigfit shares
(2 X 4 8). 'The full sister gets half the estate, which equals l Oshares.
The two paternal half sisters get two shares: one for each.
3· The Abbreviated Case o{Zayd: This case Includes a mother, a paternal
grandfather, one full sister, one paternal halfbrother, and one paternal
half si,ter. It is so "1iled because the common denominator in this
,ase is 10l3 a\:Cordiflg to the tm1qasamal1, and ,il can be abbreviated
through dividing it by 2 thot .results in 54. For more illusttatio11, the
main number of shares is six, for the mother gets one-sixth of tbe
estate, arid the remaining five.-sixths are divided among the paternal
_grandfathe-r and the sibling~ through ,t he muqtlsamali. Therefore,
there must be six shares according to their number (a male's share
equals the share of two females); however, the remaining fivesixths cannot be divided by siK. So, 6 (the common denominator)
is to be multiplied by 6 (their number of shares) so the result is 36
shares. The mother gets one-sixth, namely equals 6 shares (6/:36).
The remaining shares are five-sixth of the 11state, namely {30/36), of
which the paternal gtandfather gets ten shares ( 10/36) through the
muqM!'lmah. The fullsi~ter gets half the estate !hat equals 18 shares
(18/36). The remaining two shares (2/36) are to be dlvided aqiong the
paternal half brotlier and the paternal half sister. l-{owever, the two
shares (2/36) cannot be divided by three (for the male gets double
the share of the female), so 3 i~ t.o be mtiltiplied by 36 (the common
denorttli1ntor) that results in '108 shares (as a new denominator).
Thus, the mother takes 18 shares (6X3 18). The paternal grandfather
gets 30 shares (10X3 30). The full sister takes 54 shates (18Xl 54).
The paternal nalf brother and paternal half sister get 6,share.,;- (2X3
6): the brother gets 4 shares a11d the sisl~r gees 2 shares (for the male
gets double the share of the femal'e),
After doing such ~ Ciikulation, we find that both the shares and the
common denominator (108) can be divided by 2, resulting in (54) as
a new common denom inator. Thus, the moth~r gets 9 shares-, the full
sister gets half the estate, namely 27 sh(lres-, the paternal grandfatne,
gets 15 shares. the,paternal half brother-gets 2 shares and the paternal
half sister one share, See the following tahlec

4- Tbe Tis 'tniyYah ofl.ayd (i.e. the case depending on using a common
denominator90): This case includes amother, apaternalgrandfather,
one full sister, two paternal halfbrothers, and one paternal half sister.
It is called 1is •iniy¥ah as the common denominacor in such a case
is ninety.
The reason ror using the common denominator 90: 6ne-fhitd of
the remainder of the estate, after giving one-sixth of the estate to the·
inother, is the best share for the. paternal grandfather. That is, the
common denominator between the one-third (of the temainder) and
the one-sixth (entitled to the mother) is 18. Moreover, we can consider
the common denominator 6 (to specify the one-sixth of the mother).
After the mother gets one-sixth, the remaining five-sixths do not
have a third as a natural numl,,er (i.e. integer). For easier calculations,
we multiply 3 by 6 that results in 18 as a common denominator.
The mother gets one-sixth tliat equals 3 shares (3/18). The patemal
grandfather gets one- third of the remainder. I.e. 5 shares (Sill!). The
full sister gets half the estate, ie. 9 shares (9/18). The remaining share
cannot be divided among the·patern;,I half siblings. Therefore. 5 fthe
number of siblings' shares as they are two males and a female) is to be
multiplied by 18 (the common denominator) that results in 90 (the
new common denominator):
►

The mother gets 15 shares (3X5 15)

►

The paternal grandfather gets 25 shares (SXS 25)

►

The fullsjstec gets 45 .shares (9XS 45)

► Tl\e two paternal halfsiblings get 5 shares (!XS S); each of the two

brothers gets 2 shares and the sister gets the remaining one share. Thiscan be illustnted through the two following tnble~:

As for all the issues of inheritance, discussed above, they relate to certainty of the death of the inherited person and certainty of existence of the
inheritors. Those issues do not involve any problematic issues as regards
the division of the estate. But here we will shed light on some problematic
issues in which neither the case of the inherited person nor the case of
the inheritor ls decided. That is, there may be uncertainty concerning the
existence of some heirs, such as the case of the fetus, drowned persons,
those who are killed under collal?sed buildings, the missing persons, and
the like. Moreover, such problematic issues may be related to the gender
of the heirs; whether the heir is male or f~male, such as the case of the
hermaphrodite and the fetus.

V INHERITANCE

Owing to the uncertaioty in such cases, there are special .chapters dedicated for such issues in the study of inheritance entitled "The Chapters of
Dividing Shares accprding to Assumption and Precautionary Procedures:•
They ate as follows:
I-The doubtful hermaphrodite
2-The fetus
3-'fhe missing person

Inheritance of a Hermaphrodite
According to the scholars of inheritance, the hermaphrodite is the person
who has both the sexual organs of the male and the female, or the person who
has not any at all.
A hermaphrodite heir can be related to the deceased as a descendant, a
sibling, a fathet's sibling, or an emancipated slave. All such people can be either
males or females. However, a hermaphrodite cannot be a father, a mother, a
grandfather, or a grandmother, as the sex of each is already known. Further,
it is unreasonable to say that a husband or a wife is a hermaphrodite, as it is
impermissible to conclude the marriage of such a person as long as his gender
is not decided.
Allah, Exalted be He, created humankind as males and females. Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
"O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and

creaud from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many
men a11d women ..."
(Qur'~: An-Nis~: 1)

V INHERITANCE

Allah, Exalted be He, also says:
"To Allah belo11gs tire dominlo11 of the lm~vens and tl,e earth;
He create$ what he wills. He gives to whom He wills female
(childre11], a11d He iives fo whom Be wills males:''

(Qur'an: Ash-Shtlra: 49)
Needless to say, Allah has sl\own and explained the rulings pertaining ro
.each gender and tte did not state the case of the hermaphrodite. This means
that a person cannot be called a male and a female at the same time, as there
is discrepancy between the features of each gender. In order to distinguish
between the two sexes, Allah , Exalted be· He, set distinctive features; howevei:,
some dubiousness and confuslon might happe1t due to the existence of both
the male and female sex orga,ns,
Muslim scholars unanimously agree that hermaphrodites inherit according
to the most predominant feature.s they l\a.ve of the two sexes. For example,
a hermaphrodite who \lrinales from the male organ ts to inherit the share
of a male, nod the one who urinates from the female organ is to inherit rhe
share of a female. This is be,c~use, the sig11 of urinating is amongst the most
common and indicative sig,ns designating one's sex, as it is a natural sign,
whether one is a child or an adult. So, whoever urinates from the male organ
is considered a male and \tk e versa, and, in such a case, the other organ ls
considered an additional one that goes back to a nalliral defect. lo this respect,
if a henna:phtodi1e person urinares from both the male and temale organs, the
matter is decided accordi11g to the orgap from which such a J?e15<)n urinates
much. But if such a person begins urinating from one of t'he two organs, then
starts to urinate from them both, the matt~r is decided according to the first.
organ urinated from. In I.bi~ regard, if a hermaphrodite child starts urinating
from both male and female o,rgans at the same time and with simifar quantity,
it is not to be decided Wlf.il s lich a person reaches puberty, so as to be able·to
dedd~ then what the child's actual sex is. Thus, such a person's qise continues
to \>e probl~matic until the age of puberty, as it is expected fo be de~ided at
thar time.
As for the signs that appear at lhe age of puberty, they are of two kinds:
some relate to men ,md C,1the,8 reJare t11 womell, With regard to tile fir5t kind,
namely, the 5igns tlut rela.t eto men, th~y involve the growth oftbe hair of the
moustache and beard, and e:jaculation. So, if any of these signs ~ppear~ that
person is a male, .As reg~,d~ the second kind, namely, the signs that relate to
women, they in.volve menstruatlng, preg11aacy and growing of breasts. Thus, if

a,1y of such .signs appear, thai per!:on is a female. However, if the signs ofb~ing
a male or a femaie do not appear at the age of puber1y, such a person's case 'is.
still considered problematic and the sltu<1tion is not ex,pected to be decided.Jo
such ~ases, it is for the Muslim scholars to decide the w,iy according to which
such a person inherits. There ar,e differerit oplr1ions ol' scholars concerning:
the inheritanee of herm11phmdi1<:s and those involved with iliem in case$ of
inheritance. These opinions are a1s follows:
A group Qfscholars ,tiew 1ha1 the hermaphrodite is to be givenihe smaller
share (whether he gets ii as a ma!\: or<\ femal~); yet, they say t'1at this poe&n9t
apply to the rest ofinhetitorii. Therefore, ifa hermaphrodite is considered to 1:,e
a male, then he receives the least p,osslble share for him as a male. However, if11
hermaphrodite is considered to be a female., then she gets her share. Moreover,
if tlle hermaphrodite is pot enli~led to any share If\ the deceased's estate in one
of the two cases (b~ing a male or a female), then such a person is not to get
any share.
Some scholars view that ,the h,etmaphroditeas well as other heirs are to get
the smallest possible shares they may receive; and fl-le remaining portion is 10
be reserved until the ,iituation of'such a p~rson i~ decided, whether a male oc
a female, or that the heirs reach ~u1 agreement concerning the division of the
remaining pl)rtion.
Some othef scholars view time the herm~phrodite is to be given half the
share of a male and half the shai:e of a female, if such a person is to inherit
according to both possibilities. However, if tfie hermaph rodite is to inh.erit
according to <,mly one po$Sibi1Jtir (e.g., beir1g a male only), such "d person is
given half the share entltled lo su cli a possibility. Thi~ is the applicable ruling
whethet lt is expected that the actual sex of such a perSon be de.:ided or not.
Another group of scbolars mal111ajps that there must be distinction between
the.two cases, i.e. whether ·the ad:ual sex of !lie beroiapl\rodite is expec.ted be
known ,or not. Thar is, if the ~ex of a hermaphrodite is expected to be known,
such a person and· other heirs .ge11 the least possible 5hares they may deserve.
So, the hermaphrodite and other heirs are to receive the specified .sh11tes of
the inheritante, and the remainder is not tu be distributed until {be sex of
the hermaphrodite is known. However, the hermaphrodite is to be given half
the share of a male and half the share,of a female if s-uch a person is to inherit
according to both possibilities&. Bu t if the hermaphrodite is .lo inherit according:
to only one possibility (e.g.. being a maleoniy), sudt as petson is given balfthe
share ecntit,led to such ll possibilit}r, And Allah,.Exalted be He, knows best.

CHAPTER

Inheritance of a Fetus
In some cases, the legal heirs may include a fetus. In fact, some problems
may arise as regards the fetus's life or death, being a male or a female, one or
more, etc. Thus, the ruling in such cases differs according to each possibility.
Hence, Muslim scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) pay great attention
to the case of the fetus, as they dedicate a whole chapter for it in their books
of inheritance.
Here, the issue that concerns us is the case of a deceased leaving behind a
pregnant woman, whether the fetus is entitled to inherit (when delivered alive)
or that his/her share is eliminated (i.e. blocked) in all cases, or that such a fetus
is entitled to inherit in some cases and blocked in others.
As for the fetus that is uniformly agreed upon his/her right in inheritance,
there should be two conditions:

First: Making sure of the existence of the fetus in the womb of a woman at
the time of the inherited person's death, even if it is just drops of male and
female sexual discharge.

V rNHERff/\N(.'.I'.

Second: T'[1e fetus is delivered ulive and io u srable condition. This ls due
lo theb.adith of the Prophet (!'BUH) in which be says:

"If a new/mm cries (or shows ony other !igns indicating life), then it is
to get a share ofi11heritancr.#'
(Related by Abu Dawud, -and it is reported that lbn Hibb~r, graded ii
as a lll/:J}h. (authentic) u,idtth)
The sign,of.!ife, concern.log the newborn child, involve crying, sneezing,
moving or any other signs indicating Life, afld ir is not restricted to
crying. Hence, the p-resence of signs oflife indkates the s1ablec6ndition
of the newbwn and1hus lhe second condition is fulfilled

As for the first condition, namely the existence of a fetus in the womb
of a woman at the time of the inherited person's death, it can be verified by
being born within !he ~pecified period of pregnanqr; the maximum and the
minimum periou of pregnancy. As regards the period of pregnancy, there are
three possible cases as follows:
The first case; Thi6 is when a woman delivers a newborn alive before the
minimum period ofpttgpartcy passes; in thi6 case, the new born gets
its share in the estate as scholars unanimously ag-ree. Thus, when the
woman delivers that newborn for a period less than six months after
the death of the inherited person, this indicates that she was acttrally
pregnant during the. lifetime of the inher1ted petson. Acoording to the
consensus of Musfim scholars, tbe minimum period of pregnancy is
six months. Thi~ is due to the statement of Allah, Exalted be He" in
which He says:
''. •.,md l1is gestatio11 and we,millg [period] is: t/1/rty mo11tlis..."

(Qur'ari: Al-Ahqaf. J5)
Allab, Exalted be Ke, also says;
"Mothers may nurse (i.e. bretJstjeed] their children two mmplete
years..."
( Qur'an: Al-Baqar,ih: 233)

So, if the period of breastfeedlng, twenty-four months, is 6ubtracted
from thirty months, the temainlngis six mon\!is which is the miniil\um
period of pregnancy

The second case: This is when the fe~ is born after the maximum
period of pregnancy passes after the death of the inherited person,
Ia such u c~se, the newbor11 do~s nol have any right in the estate.

Cb.prcr 18 : Inborlm11ce ofa forw

315

This is because the delivery of the chlld llftcf the rn~Ximum period of
pregroincy indicates that pregnancy has happened after the death of
the inherited person.
Soholars•ctiffer with regard to determining the maximum period of pregnancy. There are three opinions:
l. The maximum period of pregnancy is two years. This is due to the

siatement of Lhe Mother of .the. Belie,vers, ' A'ishah (may Allah be
pleased with her), who said:

"The fetus does riot stay i11 the wamb ojt/ie mother for t1·1ore than rwo
years.• '
There is 110 room for ijti/11ld reg;,rdit1g thts statem,·nt, as it is dealrwlth
as a marfo ' (traceable) l..mdit/1.
2. The maximum period of pregnancy is four 1•ears. This is because when
there is no legal text, we n1ust resot1 to the actual cases, and some
cases of pregnan<:y have been reported to last for about four years.
3. The maximum period of pregnancy ls five years.
Tp.e preponderant of those opinions - Allah know5 best - is thaf the
maximum period of pregnancy is- four yea.r:s. This is based on the fact that
there i6 no deci6ive proof ipdkatfug &uch period, so we should consider the
actual cases, and it trµly happened tt\at some cases of pregnancy lasted for fuur
years; and Allah knows best.

The third case; This is when lhe newborn is delivered after a period more
than lhe minimum period of pregoaucy and less than the maximum
p~o\l of pregna11cy. In sµcb .sic cast; if su~h a woman has ·a husband
or a master ((.e., if she is a slave gi.rl) who copulates with her during
lhat pniod, toe boru child does not have any right in inheritance. This
is because, toere is no evidence that pregnancy h111mened during tile
lifetime of the inherited person; pregnancy might have happened.due
to copulation that took piace after the death of the inherited person.
However, if that woman does not have a hushand ora master ·or that
they are absent during that period, or thal they cannot copulate With
her due to impotency or for any other rea5on; then the newborn ls
entitled to inherit, as there is a proof indicating its ex1,stence during
the lifetime of the inherited person.

V

INHERITANCE

In this regard. Musltlrt scholars unanimously agree that when tl1e newborn
crles, then there is-a certalnty that it is born alive nnd is in a stable condition.
Howevet, they differ as regatds those signs inilic~tlng life other than crying,
such as moving. suckling or breathing. Some scholars view that r.be sign of the
newbom's life is restricted lo :crying, excluding any of the other accompanying
signs. Other scholars consider the sign of crying as well as any other signs
indiaitfng life. The latter i~ the preponderant opinion, as the sign of life is
not re.stricted to crying, but it includes other signs, such as moving and the
like. as \!1ewed by some scholars. Even ii the ~ign oflife cefers to just crying or
making any voice, this does not mean that we sbould exclude any other signs
inilicating life; and Allah knows best.

How to Give the Fetus Its Share
If there is a fetus among the kgal heirs, they should wait until It~ bi rth to
know .whether the newborn will be entitled to any share in the estate or not,.so
that the estate is distributed at once. But if the heirs do not agree to wail until
the baby is-delivered and demand lhe distribution of the estate before its'birth,
is that permissible for theni? MusHm scholars have two different opinions with
regard to this isslle:
The first ~piruon: Tbe heirs are 1iot permitted to distribute the
~late.-Thls"is due to the uncertainty concerning ·the case of the· fews.
us there are many possibilltles, S\JCh as the number of fetuses. Such a
matter may cause a great difference in the fe~s•s share as well as the
:shares of other heirs.
'l 'be second opinion: It Is permissible for the heirs to distribute the
estate before the child ts born and they are not obligated to wait, as
it may cause. harm to them. This i~ because some of the heirs may be
needy and the period ofpregnancy might be long. Thus, accordfhg to
this opinion, the share of the .fetus is to be considered so that there is-a
guarantee that the newborn gets its due share. So, there is no ne£d for
delaying the distributioq of the estate.

According \o the appar¢nl circumstances. the second opinion Is the
preponderant one. Yett the scholars adopting th~ second opi:uon differ as
regards ihe ammtof (share) that should be left for·the fetu6. This Is because
no one can know the actual case of the fetus except Allah. Besides, the case
of 1he. fetus involves so many possibilities: being alive or dead, one or {!lore. a
male or female, etc. Undoubtedly, those several poi;sibilities have their effect

Ch:i.pter 18: lnhetl<anceofa Fcn.1>

on the share of the fetus-as well a!i the shares of those involved with him in the
,Inheritance, Therefore, scholars differ concerning the amount that should be
left for the fetus, There-are thtee llplnionswith regard to this issue,

llirstr 'rhere is no criterion regarding the number o( fetuses a woman
may carry, Here, the criterion1s-the cases ofthe olher heirs who inherit
along with the fetus. Thall is, if a pei:son inhefits only iri some cases or
his/her $hare is unspecified, such as the ca5e of !he agnate relatives,
such a person.is not to bE: giVdll <1nything. As for The heir. who inherits
11' llll caSes 11nd whose ;imount of shate may differ, sudi :i person is 10
be.given Jhe least share he/she may get With regard to the heir wh()sc
·share does not differ in -a mount In all cases, he/she is to be given his/
her full share. Aftet doin1g so, the remainder of fhe estate is reserved
until t:he case of the fetus is dec-ided.
Second: The fetus ,is to be treated according to what i~ best for it (i.e. the
possibili.ty according to which the fetus may get ,t he largest possible
share) and those inherllting along with it are lo receive their least
possible .shares, Thus, th,e bigger share of that of two m.al~s or thaf of
two females is to be re.stirved for the fetus, and the other heirs who
have specified shares are to receive the least of the shares they deserve,
Therefore, after the clilldl is bom and the case is d~clcfod (conc.ceming
sex >!.Jld number, etc.), there .ire three procedures to be follow~µ:
1- The newborn gets iti; due share from the reser:ved amount, and

what remains ls to be reclistributed among the heirs,
2- 'fhe newborn g~~ all J!he reserved amount ifit equals its share.
3- The ncwl;,orn completes ils due share from the shares of the other
inheritors if the reserved amount is less than ils due share.

Third: A share equal io 1h,? share of one male or one female, the larger
of whicli is 10 be resmre,d for the fetus. The reason behind this is ,that
it happens In most casei1 that a woman delivers only one baby each
time, Hence, the ruling ,;hould be established on what happens l!lOSt
often. According to this opinion, the judge ls to assign a sponsor, from
among the heirs, to gururantee that the newborn babies will get (heir
full shares {if they are lnore than 011e}, This is because a newborn
cannot ask for irs rjghtfpJ share, so the judge does thi& oo the .child's
behalf as a precauponary procedure,

V INHilllITANC:£

Finally, l:he soundes.t of 1the three nforementioned opinions is that whicl1
involves more precaution, namely the second one. 1'hat ·is, it happens many
times that women give btrth 10 twins, but delivering more than two babies
rarely occurs. Besides, assign.i nga sponsor, as mentioned in the third opinion,
may be difficult even if it is clone, some matters may happen and prevent such
sponsor from observing the assigned mission. Thus, the newborn chlldren
may not receive thelr due shares lf they turned out to be !llOre thl!n one child,
so their- righ1s may be losl;.
A~cording to the ~ound~,t opinion, th~rc are six possibi1i1ies foi- the fetu5:
I) The child may be delh•ered dead
2) ft may be only one mtale
:; ) ll may be only one femal~
-4) 1t mll}' be one male and one female

5) I! may be two males
6) It may be two female~
These are six possibilities" for each is a ~pedfic case as regards the· distribution of the estate. Besides, the distribution of the estate is- to be :icr.orrung
to a mBthematical process fot each possibJllty. The cases of the heirs are 10 be
considered. As for the heir \l1ho geis tl\e same share in all cases, he/she is- to
get his/her full share. However, those: heirs whose shares may differ in amount
ftom a case to another are to, receive the leasl of their shares. With regard to
those who inherit in some ca;,es and are blocked in others, !hey get nothing of
the estate. Aftet that, the rem11inder of the estate is to he reserved.until the fetus
is delivered and its case is decided as mel'l.!ioned above.; and Allah knows best

Inheritance of a Missing Person

The missing person means the one whose state is not defined and it is not
known whether alive or dead. This may be due to traveling, participating in a
battle, being shipwrecked, or being captured by enemies, etc.
Since the missing person's state is not determined as to whether being
existent or not, each case of the two has its own ruling. Some of these rulings
pertain to:
• His wife
• His inheritance from others
• Being inherited by others
• Being an effective heir on the shares of other heirs

320

V INHERITANCE

As. n~ither of the two possibilities (being alive or, dead) is considered
more probable than the other, there must be a designated period until the
real .state of the missing, pe,rson is verified, providing a chance 10 look for
him. If that period elapses \\rjth nothing known about such a person, this will
be evidence that he is no Jo nger alive. To view of this, scholars unanimously
hove agreed to designate such a period; yet, there is disagreement regarding
how long if should be according to two opinions:

First opinion: The c:riterion is the estimation ofthe judge regardin_g
this period, This t;, because the original rule is that the missing
person is alive an,d this is not to be overlooked except with a
decisive proof or the like. This opinion is unanimously adopted
by the majority of Muslim scholars, whether such a mis.s ing
person is expected to be safe or dece.ased, and whether he has
been lost before or afte.r the age of ninety. Thus. a missing person
is to be expected to come back until there is a proof that he has
died, or that a perfod ends after which it becomes certain that he
has died.
•
Second opinion; Thi!; op41ion adopts an elaborated view which implles
that the missing person ,has two cases;

1- If the missing pemon is most likely \o be deceased, it is imperative to
wait for fout years since he was last seen. To elaborate, persons such as
those who go missing in a peril. while fighting, or in ship wreckage of
which some passengers were sufe while others drowned, and persons
who are lost wilhi11 the loc;tlity - for example, going out for prayer
and never came back - are to be expected back for a four-year period
since they were· last seen. If no news about a missing person js heard
throughout this. per:iod, he is surely deemed to be dead.
2- lf the missing p1;.1'son is most likely to be safo and sound (e.g., those

who trove! for trade. tourism or learning. and nothing is heard abouf
them), it is imperative to wait until such a person reaches ninety since
his birth, until it is not likely for him to be living any more, before
declaring his de;ith.
The first opinion. referring to the estimation of the judge in d~iding the
period to wait for a missin2; person to come back before declaring his death,
is the preponderant, for such a period varies according to tlme, states and
per.sons. This is because communications and transport means have made the
whole world much doser, q,uite unlike the past.

Chapter J 9, lnherirnnce of.a Missing l'e,,son

321

lf the Person from whom the l\ilissing one Inherits Dies
wilhin the Said Designated W~1iting Period
If !.he inherited person has no o,ther heirs except the missing per~on. all his
estate is to·be withheld, until it is dear ('whether the missing person is aJive or
dead}, or the designated waiting period is over.
Scholars maintain different views concerrting the issue of the inherittcl
p,en.on who has heirs other than the missing person. The soundest view is
the opinion of the majority of schol;irs; that is the heirs who co-inher,i t with
the missing person are given the least possible shares. Thus, each heir is io
be given his/her lea.s t amount wlrile the remainder is to be withheld. Hence,
the etate is to be divided as 1f the missing person is alive, then as dead. The
heir who is entitled to a bigger sh,ire in one of the two cases (i.e. the missing
person's being alive or dead) IS ro be given the least &hare; the heir is entitled
to a:n equal share in both cases will be given his/her share in full; and the heir
who inherits only ia one of ihe two cases will be given nothing. The remaindl!f'
of the estate wUlbe wHbheld until the mis.~ing person's state is verified

lf the Missing Pe£Son is Deem,id Dead
The missing person is deemed! dead if the designated waiting pedod has
passed with no evidence disdosin1g his st;itus. Thus, his own estate and share
(whic}\ he/she haS' inherited, as rnentioned in ,:he pr~vious case) are to b~
divided among his heirs who are BtW alive, excluding those who died dil.ring
the designated waiting period. That is- because his death was determined lat~r
after the death of his heirs who are, 1101 then entitled to inheJTit.

Inheritance of the Drowned and
Those Killed Under Collapsed
Buildings

The issue of mass deaths, in which many people die and some of them
are legal heirs of others, is a problematic issue that causes great confusion.
This is because it is difficult to realize who bas died first to be considered an
inheritor and who has died later to be considered an heir. Nowadays, mass
deaths frequently happen as a result of road accidents, such as car and train
accidents, and plane crashes. Mass deaths can also be a result of building
collapse, accidental fire, drowning, bombardment, etc. With this in mind, the
issues involved in the inheritance of those decea.~ed people, who legally inherit
from one another, are summarized in five cases:
• When all the deceased persons are known to have died at the same time:
In this case, scholars unanimously maintain that there is no inheritance,

324

V TNHERlTANCE

as inheritanceisbasecl upon verifying lbdt tl\e hcir is al'iveafter the death
of the inherited person, which is not avnilable in such a case.

• When s.ome of them ~u:e still known to have died before some pthers:

In .sucl1 a case, schol.ars irnanlmously view that those who have died
later are entitled to iniherit from those who have died earlier, since it is
verified that the heir has temporarily survived the inherited person,
• 'Wheq some oflbero are known 16. have died before some.others without
determining who ba1ie died first.
, When some of them are known lo have died before some others yet
that is forgott~n.
• When the sequence oftheir deaths is unverified and ii is not recognized
if they all !\ave died air the same lime or at different times.
In these last three cases, ihere is a great room for probability; ijH/uid (legal
reasoning and discretion) and speculatlon among s~holars (may Allah have
mercy on them) who entertained two different opinions:

The first opjnion: entails that there Is no inheritance between those
deceased people in all these three cases. This view is supported by the
opinion of a group of the Ptophet's Companions, including Abu Bakr
A:i•Siddlq, Zayd 1bn Thabi\ and • Abdullth Jbn •Abbas (may A.Uah
b~ pleased with then~ all). The three Imams Abil Hanifah, Malik and
Asl\-Shafi'i (may Ailah hnve mercy on them) said the same, and it is
-one of the opinions adopted in the school of Imam Ahmad. This is
based on the faet that one of the conditions to inherit is tbe certaipty
that the heir is alive after the death of the inherited person, wh'ich is
not only unfulfilled here, but also doubted, and the rule of thumb is
tl:tat there is no Inheritance with ,doubt.,Moreover, those who died in
the Battles of Al-Yama1nah, £i/nn and Al-Harrah, did not inherit from
one another.

Tbe second opinion: entails thnt each of them inherits from the other,
following the opinio1n of a group of the Companions (may Allah be
pleased with them) t ncluding 'Ulnar Ibnul-Khattab and ' All Ton Abu
lalib (may Alfah be ple.ised with them), which is the opinion acted
upon in the H11nbali School. The undedying assumption behind this
view is that each om: of them has certainly bun alive 1md must have
lasted until after the death orthe other.To illustrate, when •·umar (may
Allah be pleased With him) was Informed of the plague that afflicted

heir claims that his inherited person has died later, ,vith no evidence, then
they have'lo take oathr.aqd no inheritance is to 'take place. According to this
opinion, every heir (among the dead persons) 'inl\erits from the original estnte
of the other dead heir excluding the new estate. To elaborate, if an heir is
assmped to have died earlier· than another, the share the latter gets from tlw
former is to be distributed among latter's Jive heirs only, i.e. we-exclude the
former from whom the latter has inherited, and we reverse I.he assumpti◊n,
and apply the same way of distribution.
The 6rst view, indicating that they ,du not inherit from one another as 1\0
lnheritanceis to be made with douht, is the preponderant one. This is because
the actual status of the deceased ones (the heirs) i.s unknown. and what fs
unknown is deemed non-exi6ten!. Moreover, the preeedence of the death of
one another rs unknown, so it is i.I'lsignificant in this case. Besides, it is not
reason.able to have deceased heirs inherit from one another, as inheritance is
.made to lct the heir make use of the inherited property, whioh 1s not the •f!ase
bere. AJso, ml\king the deceased persons inherit one another is a contradictoryview. This is because givh,g a deceased heir from the estate of another indicates
that the former ha.s survived the latter, and then giving thelatter from 'the estat~
of the former indicates the opposite; this implies that each of tl1em has died
before the other, which is not logical. With this in !'ni.nd, the preponderant
view is that only live heirs inherit the estate of the deceased ones, in ordet
to adhere to what is certain and keep away from doubtful matters; and Allah
knows best

Inheritrunce by Radd
According to scholars of inheritance, the radd means giving the remainder
of the estate (after the prescribed shares are divided) to the legal heirs entitled
to prescribed shares, in case there is no agnate relative(s) entitled to get the
remainder. Allah. Exalted be He, stated the prescribed shares as half, onefourth, one-eighth, two-thlrds, one-third, and one-sixth, and explained how
the agnate males and females iJ1herit. The Prophet (PBUH) also said:
"GiYe the shares of the inhe,·itance (prescribed in the Quran) to
those who are entitled to re,~eive them. Then whatever remains
should be given to the closest ,male relative of t/1e deceased."'
This noble h.adith clarifies the text of the Glorious Qur'an and puts the
heirs of both types in the right order: Those entitled to receive prescribed
shares then tl1e agnate relatives. According to this h,adith, whenever both types
are involved in a case of inheritanc,e, those entitled to prescribed shares are to
be given their due shares first. and ·then the remainder, if any, is to be given to
the agnate relatives. If there are agnate relatives only. they are to be given the
whole estate divided according to tlheir share.

V INHERITANCE

The problem arises when there are persons entitled to prescribed share.s
whose shares of the estate are less than the amount of the estate, and there ar~
no agnate relatives to get the,remainder. Tn such a case, the remainder will be
redistributed among those entitled to prescribed shares in proportion lo their
prescribed shares, except the two spouses, according to the following,proofs:

First; All,m, Exalted be He, says:

"... But lcindred by •blood are ,rearer lo 011e ,mother regarding
inheritance in 1/ie decree ordained by A//pl1...q

(Qur'An: Al-Antal: 75)
Those entitled to the prescribed shares are the deceased's blood relatives,
so they are more entitled to the deceased's e.stale than anyone else.

Second: The. Prophet (PBUH) says:

"If anyone leaves a property, It goes to his lieirs."
(Related br Al-Bukhdri and Muslim) '
This ruliqg is general in all types ofestate left by the deceased. inclLlding
what is lef1 over (the remainder) after distributing the prescribed
shares. Thus, one's legal heirs, who are entitled to prescribed ~bares,
are more entitled to one·s estate !han anyone else.

Third: Sa· d lbn AbQ Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him), narrated
that he said to the Prophet (PBUH) while he was v:isiting him because
he was-ill:
"O Messenger of Allah! l !,ave no heirs except my oillj, daughter.~'
The Prophet (PBUH) did 0 01 deny restricting the inheritance to the
daughter, If it were impen11issible, it would n9t be approv~ by the Prophet
(PBUH). This denotes that the one entitled to a prescribed share gets the
remainder of the estate if there are no other agnate relatives; and this is what
is meant by \he radd,
The radd is applicable rvirh regard to the persons entitled to receive
prescnbed shares except the two spouses, for they mlly not have a common
blood relationship. Thus, the ,h.usband and !he wife are not includ~d in the
genera! denotation of the follow1ng verse:
~... Bui lcindred E,y blood are nearer· ta one another regarding
inheritance in the decree ordained by Allah...u
(Qur'an: Al-Anfal: 75)

Schol'ars have unanimously agreed that the two spouses are not among
those who are to be gi\ren the.excess ofestate. Yet, it was reported that ' Uthman
Jbn ' Affan (may Allah be pleased with him) once judged that the remainder
of the estate is to be given a husband. Scholars view that ' Uthmii.n's judgJJ1ent
may have been due to a reason other than the radd, such as being an agoate

Inheritanc.e of Kindred by Blood

According to scholars of inheritance. kindred by blood are the relatives
who are not entitled to have presc;ribed shares nor are they from one's agnate
relatives. They are of four types:
First: Those who belong to the deceased, namely daughters' children
and the children of the so.ns' daughters and so forth in a descending
lineage.

Second: Those to whom 1the deceased belongs, namely the noninheriting grandfathers and grandmothers, ' and so forth in an
ascending lineage.

Third: Those who belong to the parents of the deceased, namely the
sisters' children, the broth,:rs' daughters, the children of maternal half
brothers, and whoever is related to the deceased through them, and so
froth in a descending linea,ge.

V INHE'RITANCE

332

Fourth; Those who belong lo grandfa1hers and grandmothers of fue
deceased. namely the deceased's father's maternal half brothers, all
paternal aWlts, all female paternal cousins, all maternal uncles, and all
matemal a11nts, no, matt& far tbey (all these relatives) -are, and th.e ir
children however ),ow in a descending lineage.
These.are 1he types of lkihdred by blood in general. They are to.inherit if
there is none entitled to inherit grescribed shares except tHe h11Sband and the
Wife, provided there are no agnate relatives. ThiS' is according to the following
evidences:

First: Allah, Exalted he He, says:
''.,. But kindred by blood are 11carer lo 011e another regarding
inheritam:e in tlie lfecree ordained by Aila'h.. ,"
(Qur'an: Al-Anfal: 75)
This means that E,lood· relDt:ives are entitled to inherit each others
according 1-o t he Judgment of Allah.

Second: 'Fhe general implication of the following Qur'anic vene:

"For me11 is a shan! of what the parents ,ind close relatives leav~,
anilfor women is~, sJ,are of what the parents and close relatives
leave, b11 it little·or,11111c/1 - ,in obligatory 1hart!'
(Qur'an: An-N'isa': 7)
The words 'men ', 'women: und 'close relatives' indude one's kindred
by blood. Thus, whoever claims that the verse refers to 11 certain case
should prove bis.daim.

Third: The Prophet ( PBU H) said:
"The maternal ,mde is the heir ofhim who f111s none."
(Related by A!!ma,d, Abfl I:>awod, Ibn MAjnh, and At-Tirmidh! who
deemed ilb.asan)'

This b_adftlt sigJlifie:s that the maternal uncle becomes a legal heir when
there i.s none entitled tv a prescribed share or agmtte relatives. As the
maternal u ncle 11,from one's kindred by bloo<l, then the same n tle oan

These are some proofs Supporting the view that one's kindred by blood

Public Treasury are not settled or it' is not established as a unique institution.
The scholars who view that the kindred by blood are· to inherit differ
regarding rhe way they receive th,~r share of inheritance, and they have some
views the commonest of which are -the following two:

flint view: 'l'hey (kindrecfb:rblood) are entitled to inherit by considering
ev~ry oneof themfn !he place of the on,e \o whom he/she is related to
the deceased, i.e. to oe gi:ven .such a person•s share. Thus, daughters'
children and the children of the sons' daughters are to be treated like
rheir mothe1·s. Likewise, !he deceastd's father's maternal halfbrothcrs
a11d -also paternal aunts.aire to be treated like the father. Similarly, the
maternal uncles, matema,1aui,ts and maternal grandfathers are to be
treated like the deceased~; mother. Moreover, brothers' daughters an~
the daughters of the bro~hers' sons ure tn he treated like their fathers
and so on.
Second view: The kindred by blood are to inherir the same as the aguate
relatives do, i.e. the close1 the relative i~, the more he/she is entitled to
iqherit; and Allah knows besL

Inheritance of Divorced Women

Verily, Allah, Exalted be He, made lhe marriage contract a cause for
inheritance. Allah, Almighty ,md Ever-Majestic be He, says:

'~nd/<Jr you is lralf of wlrat your wives leave if tl,ey lu1ve 110 clrild.
B11t if tlrey /rave a cliild, for yo11 is one fourtlr of what ti,ey leave,

(Qur'fin: An-Nisa': 12)

llllless there is a cause that prevents· Qne l)f them from inheriting from the

V INHERITANCE

!he two spouses from inhe1tit1ng one another. To illustrate, the two spouses
inherit from one another in. case of the revocable-divorce as long as the wife is
still in the wlliting period. Muslim scholars have singled out ,i ~edflc section
for "The Inheritance of Dnrorced Woman~ Regarding this, divorced women
arc of three types:
First type: A revoc.ibly-divorc.ed woman, no 1T111tter the divorce has
occurred while the lltusband is in good he:ilth or uot.
Second type: A wolnan inevocnbly divorced while her husband is in
good health.

Third type: A woman irrevocably divorced while her husbantl is in his
last illness.
Concerning the legal ruling of each of tbe above cases, the revocably
divorced woman is unaolnnously agreed to be- entitled to inherir once her
husband dies as lo11g as she is stiU ill her•waiting period. This is because she is
still regarded as a wife and 1;he is entitled to all the rights a wife has.
1t is also unanimously agreed by ,cholars that the irrevocably drvorced
woman, while her husband lis in a good health or suffers from a curable disease
(i.e. is•not seriously ill) and not being rnspected to have disinherited his wife
(i.e. by'divorcing her), is not entitled to iilherit ftomher husband, for she ls-no
longer·related to him.
Likewise, the irrevocably divorced woman, whose husband is incurably ill
and he is not suspected to have disinherited his wife (i.e. by divorcing her), is
not entitled to inhedt from him.
In contrast to the previious case, .the irrevocably divorced woman while
her husband fs in his last illness, Is entitled to inherit from him during the
waiting period and after it ends. provided that the husband is suspected to
have intentionally disinherited her (by divorcing her) and that she.has neither
remarried nor apost;ltized after the divorce. This view is asserted by the
incident when Caliph 'Utlum\o (may Allah be pleased with him) judged that
the wife of' Abdur-Rahm~11, Ibo ' Awf (may Allah be pleased with him), whom
he irrevocably divorced in his la&t illness to disinherit her, had the right to
inherit from him (i.e: •Abdur- Rahman lbn •Awf).' This judgment. which ill not
restricted to the waitingpe11iod, w.is lcnown among the Prophet's Companfons
and none disapproved of it, .d,:spite rule of the avoidarice of disp11tes and sins.
lhis is be,ause such an iU-~ntentioned husband is treated according to his bad
intent (i.e. his intentional dlvorce of his wife in his last iUness to disinherit
her); and Allah knows best.

CHAPTER

Inheritance ,among People of
Differe1t1t Religions

By referring to difference in mligion, we mean that the inherited person
embraces a religion different from that of the heir. This topic includes two issues:

First: When a Disbeliever Inherits from a Muslim and Vice Versa
Muslim scholars have entertained four different opinions with regard to
this issue:

First opinion:The majority ofscholars state that a Muslim never inherits
from a disbeliever nor doe:s a disbeliever inherit from a Muslim. This
is because the Prophet (PB:UH) says:
'¼ Muslim cannot be the h!eir of a disbeliever, nor can a disbeliever be
the heir of a Muslim.''
(Related by Al -Bukhari an d Muslim)'

V INHERJTANCE

Second opinion:'J'he Muslim one 11eyerinherits from the disbdievcr and
vice versa, except thmugh the wat,i'' according to the b.adifh that reads:'½ Muslim cannot be the }ieir ota Christian except when he{the Cltristia11
person) is hi.s (the M usli11~) slave or his slave-girl."
(Related by Ad-D:lra,qutni)'
This fladith sig.nitlc!, that the Muslim heir inherits from his Chl'l~tia11
manumitted slave and vice versa according to anaiogical deduotion.

Third opinion: 'Ibe disbefiever l nherits from his Muslim relative if the
former converts to :I!ilatn before the estate of the Muslim deceased i.s
divided. This ls according to the b,adfth:
':-\.11 estate which wm diviaed in the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance
(the fahiliyyah) may follow the division in force then. but any estate in
Islamic times nrustfollow the division laid dow11 by Jslam."'

Theb.adith signlfies that a disbeliever iseniitled to inherit from a Muslfm
if the former converts to Islam before the estate of the Musllm de<!eased
is divided.

Fourth opinion: The Muslim inherits .from the disbeliever and not vice
versa d1.1e to the ha1#tl1;
''Islam increases and never decreases.'''
This is because when the Muslim inherits from the disbeliever that is
considered an increase, and not vlce versa. The b.adith signifies that Islam
leads to increase not to decrease.
The preponderate view - and Allab knows best - is the first one, (l.ec t·he
Muslim never inbe,rits from the disbeliever and vice versa) due to its sound
and explicit proof unlike those of the other views, which are either weak or
Inexplicit proofs.

Second: InherltaQce a!mong Disbelievers
As far as: inlieritance ls concerned, disbelievers are divided into
two stales:
First state: It is indisputable that disbeilevers of the same religion
tnherit<from oue an,other (e.g. a Jew from.another Jew aud a Ch.ristiao
from a Christian),

Chapcer 24: lnhe,foance among Poopk: 1,f Different Religions

Second state: Scholars mai ntain lhree different views concerning disbelievers of various religions (t>.g. Jews, Chrlstfons, magi, or pagans)
whether they ioherll from one another or not in re.gard to determining
Whether disbelief invo\ve.s one or several religions.
First view: The Han.ill and Shafi '1 $chools maintaiµ. that disbeffef
involves one rel!gjon (i.e. all disbelievers are ofthe saroe state). 'This is
also one of the opinions adopted in the Hanbali School, Moreover, !his
is the opinion of the majo:rity of scholars tliat disbelief, including all its
creeds., is regarded as one 'religion. 'Thus, disbellevtrs lnherit from one
another regardless of differeoce in religion. This is be"'3use the kgnl
tex.ts with regard are general, so they are n.o t to be restricted unless by
the Lawgiver. To illustrate':, Allah, £xalted be He, ·Says:
':.\nd lho$e who disbelie,md are allies of one another..."

(Qur'an: Al-A.nftl.1: 73)
Second view!Disbelief ccimprises three religions: Judaism, Chrlstian'ity,
and the other types as 011e religion, us they have no Sacred Book, Thus, o:
Jew is nor to inherit from a.Christian and both of them ar-e not l'O inherit
from a pagan, and so on.

Third view: Disbelief comprises several creeds; people of each.are ~ot
10 inherit from those oPothers. To illustrate, the Prophet ('PBUH) i;ays:

''People oftwo. different religioJls cannot inherit from one 1111othe1:~
(Relates by Ahmad, AhO Dawt'ld, An-Nasa'i and lbFI Majah)•
According fo the afore.mentiqned b.adith. the thlrd view seem~ lo be the
preponderant one. That 'is, people of different religions, e.g. Muslims and
disbelievers, are not to lnherft ftom one anotl\er due to the lack of mutual
6upporf among them, and -also b,!cause the cause for inheri'lance ill this case
contradicts the. cause ,impeding inhedtance; In other words, dlfference in
religion entails conflict in aTI othei: matters, and this leads to the ctisinheritaiice
from one another.
'Ihe scholars who view that disbelief involves one rel.lgion consider that
the dlffe.rence of location (i.e. ilvi.n g in two different states) is ,a disinheriting
factor due to the lack o( mutual support among them. which is applicable
when thete is diffe.reilce in relie~on. Thus, it seem~ tn\)re appropriate..that
people of different religions, a Christian and his Jewish relative for exarripie,
c:apnot inherit from one another. However, disbclie\1ers of the same religion
can inherit' from one another;·and All'a h knows best.

Inheritance of the Murderer of the
Inherilted Person

Causes of inheritance mai• exist, yet an entitled heir may not be given his/
her prescribed share. There are many causes that prevent one from receiving
one's share of estate. One of these causes is the case of an heir who murders the
inherited person. To illustrate, th,e Prophet (PBUH) says:

"No (share of the) i11heritance· (of the murdered person) is to be
give11 to the murderer."'
The Prophet (PBUH) also says:
'¼ murderer is not to inheriit anything (from the inheritance of the

person he killed.•
This mainly aims at blocking means to committing what is prohibited, as
love for wealth may drive an heir to murder whom he may inherit. The wellknown rule states, "Whoeve.r hasf,ens to possess something before Its due lime
will be punished by not havin.g JI~»

344

V INHE_RJTANCE

Scholars, unanimously agree that 1hemur<!~er of the inherited person is
to be disinherited. Yet, they maintain different views with reg.u-d to the type of
murder that prevents one &c,m inheritance.
Al!:Cording to Tmim Ash-Sbafi't (may Allah have mercy on him) the
murderer never inherits any1!hing, no matter wha1 type of murder .it is. 'That is
due to dte<generality of the !i:adith of the Pcophet {PBUH) in which he says:

'it murderer 'is not to inherit anything (from the Inheritance of the
person he killed)."'
This signifies that the murderet i~ not entitled to inherit from hi~ victim
in orde,r not to let killing be a me.ins to ha.~ten obtaining inheritance,
Consequently, whoever has a hand in the killing is to be disinherited, even if
rightful,. For example. the oi1e who executes the qi~a~ (legal retribution), the
person who gives the judgment of killing such ·as the-judge, the witiiess in
a murder case, are all to be 1:lisinherited. Thi.s is applicable eve11 if the act of
ki!Ung is unintentionally co:mmitted, such as lhe killing done by one wh.o is
asleep, insane or a child. Be,;ides, this rule is to be applied in case the killing
mistakenly results from a pe:rmissibleact, such as the case of a discipliner or
the physician who helps the person in treattnent.
Followers of t he schoof of Imam A.broad view that unrightful killing
is the only kind that disinherits the ktllerc Unrightful killing 1s that wnich
entails a legal liability, such as qi£iz5. (legal retribution), diyah (blood
money), or expiation, such ~ts the premeditat·ed murder, <juasi-premeclit'1ted
tnurder, and accidental hom icicle. This is also applicable with regard to what
re5embles accidental homicide, such as being the cause of killing, or the
killing committed by a child, an insane or a sleeping person. In contrast to
this, if the type of killing d,oes not entail qi1dL diyah or expiation, then it
does not cause one to be d1isinherited. To illustrate, killing'.someone as in
qi1a1 or in self-defense does not entail blocking one from inhe.ritance. This
is -1lso to be applied in case ·the killer is a just person whl!rea5 the murdered
person is an oppressor of th,~ killer and also in case the killing results from a
pennissible act s uch as di~cl plining-or curiJ)g.
What is me11tio11ed ,1bo11e 1s also the view of the Hanafi School whose
followersconsid'e r beingacause ofkilling does not cause one to be disinherited,
as In cases when one digs 11 well ot puts a stone accidentally causing the
inherited person to die. 'Ibis i.s also applicable in case of accidental homicide
or killil!g by a child or an ln1.ane person.

Chapter 25: lnherlraocc of d\e Murderer nf rhe Inliericed Pel'On

34,S

According to the Maliki School, <1 murderer has two ~ta!~:
First case: When a murderer intentionally kills the mherited person; in
such 11 case, the 1nurderer,is not to inherit either from rhe estate of 1ke
murdered or the diyah (blood money).
Second case: When one accidentally kills the inherited person; ht such a
case, one is 10 inherit from the murdered persons estate, but not from
his diya/1. This i& because,_in such a case, the killer does qot'intend (o
kill the inherited person, yet if is obligatory upon him (the lcillet} to
pay the diyah, so he cannot i11herit something he is obliged to pay,
On reviewing the aforesaid opinions, the preponderant one seems to be
tlia\ the kir)d of killing that disinherits one Is that which entails a legal liability,
while the accidental homicide does not disinherit one., as maintained by the.
Hanbali and the Hanaf'i School~. This ls because ln,case murder entails a legal
liability, the killer is not exi;used and must bear the responsibility; thus, he is to
be disinherited. However, in case killing does not entail a legal liability, the,killer
is excused and Is not responsible for it; thus, he is not to be disinherited.
If we ace to follow the opmion adopted by the folluwers ofTmam AsnSM,fi' t, which sf;ltes that any type of murder prevents the heir (the killer
ill such cases) from inheritance, this will prevent executing the prescribed
punishments.
According to what is 111enti(med above, the generality of the Prophet's
b.!ldrth ''No (shate of the) inheritance (of the m11rdeted person) is to,be gi11c11 to
the murderer,» ls restricted only to the case of killing unrightfully which does
not entail a legal liability, Allah. Exalted be He, knows best.

Marriage
Marriage is a serious and crucial subject that made faqihs (Muslim jurists)
dedicate great parts of their volumes to tackle it, explaining its rulings as well
as its purposes and virtues. This is because marriage is ordained through the
Qur'an, the Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition). and juristic consensus.
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

In the Qur'an, Allah, Exalted be He, also mentions the women one is

MARRIAGE

Moreover, the Prophet (PBUH) e:<hor,ted people to marry and made
marriage desirous and recommendable; He (PBUH) s.iid:

"O young pe.ople! Whoever among yo11 has the ability to ,nar,y
should marrJ\ for it helps in lowering 011es gaze a11d guarding ones
chaftity (i.~. it guards one's private parts agai11st immorality).."'
He (PBUH) also said:

KMarry wome1t who are loving and ,,ery proliftc,fQr I shall be proud
()f the great numbei· ofyou (i.e. the MttsUm nation) in comparison
with (other) nations 011 the Day of ReswTectio11.''1
Among the glorious virtues of marriage are the following:
❖ Marriage i.iwolves keeplilg the existence of the bum,m race, increasing

the nwnberofMuslims, causing annoyance to the disbelievers through
the procreation of those striving in the cause of Allah ns well as those
defending His religion, lslan1.
❖ Marriage leads to maintaining chastity and keeping away from the

unlawful sexual intercourse that ruins human communities.
❖ Marriage involves the responsibility of men toward women that includes

,belter:ing them and providing for them. Allah. £~-aired be He, says:
~fen are in diarge of women b)I fright of] what {qualities]
.Allah has gi,1en 011e 011er the other and what they spend {fer
mai111enance]from tl1eirwe11/th...u
(Qur'an: An-Nist\': 34)
♦ Marriage creates

an atmosphere of tranquility, mutual concord,
.security, and spiritual comfort berwee11 both husband and-wife. Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
"A11d ofHu signs is thnt He crUdedfor you from yourselves malt4
cthat you may foul tra11q11ility in tl1em..." •
(Qur'm: Ar-Rum: 21)

All3h also ~ays:
"It is He W110 created y ou from one 10111 and created frottr it its.
male that lie illight dwe/11-n secilrlty with lier...u

(Qur'll.n: Al-A· clf: 189)
❖ Marriage is a means of keeping the human communities from being

iQdulged in iqtmoralities- that ruin morals and eliminate virtue.

Chapter j: Marriage

❖ Marriage is-11 means of preserving progeny, keeping blood relations,

and esi-ablishing honorable families involving mercy; unity, and
support i.n 1vhat is righL
❖ Marriage raises man above leadingapimal life and enables him to lead

an hol)orable human life.
There are so many other virt:ues of Jawfol, honorable marri:tge which is
based on I.he insrruciions of rhe Noble Book of All'ah, the Qur'an, and the
'Scmmr/i of His Prophe1 (PBUH). Marriage is a regal contn1et enabling each
spouse 10 have lawful. enjoyment; of the other. In support of this view, the
Prophet (PBUFi) said:

-[rcat women kindly, as they are (like) captives in your houses."'

r11 another narratiou ofthe b.adith:
"llltercourse with them ( women) has been made lawful unto you by
tha Word ofAllah (through ,'egal marriage),"'
The marriage contract is a ce1venant betweeo the. two spouses, as Alla1'1,
£xalted be He, says:

•~ .. and they have taken ftom you a solemn co1>et1ant."
(Qur'an: An-Nisa': 21)
Thus, it isl\ bindil)g contract obligating each spouse to observe the other•ij
tights dutifully; Allah, Exalted be He, says1
''O yo11 w/10 /,ave believeal,fulfill [all] contracts ..."
(Qur'an: AI-Maidah: 1)

Polygamy
It has been made lawful for !ht! man to marry m9rethan oQe, provided that
he is able to d9 so, 1ll)d is certain h,e would not be unjust in dealing with them:
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

•~ ..the11 marry those that please yo11 of [other] wome11, two or

The kind of justice required from the.man is 10 treat his wives equally ,is
much as possible, put1ing them il11l on an equal footing regarding provision;
clothing, housing, and even the n1Jmber of nights spenl' with them,

V1 MARRIAGE

In addition, permissibility of"pofygiuny is one of the virtues of this Shari 'ah
(islamic Law}. It is applicable at all times and anywhere. as it involves great
benefit& for men, women, and society. [n expiainlng more, it is known that
the nwnber of women excemls that of men due to tliedangers men are mo,·e
,Hkely to face, such as wars 1,nd trawling. Thls resu1ts 'in less number of men
compared to women. 'Ilius, if itis impermissible for a man to marry more than
one woman, many women will remain unmarried.
Moreover, \t is known tfoat women are afllicted with menses :ind confmement. so if it is made prohibited for a man to murry more than one woman,
there will be many times at whi.cb a man is deprived of enjoyment and procteatfon. Furthermore, it is known I.hat enjoying one's wife fully and fruitfully
begins to decline when she t,eaches menopal,llie at the age of fifty, unlike man,
who still has the ability as well as the,<le~ire for enjoyment and procreation
until he reaches senility. Therefore, if !llarriage is restricted to one woman,
man will then miss much f:ood in addition to Josirtg the benefits of having
progeny and procreation.
Since the mtmber of \.Yomen exceeds that of men in most communities,
allowing man to mar:ry only one woman will result in that many women
will not find breadwinner.s 10 pro\ilde for them. CoosequenOy, lacking
breadwinners may lead wqmen to immorality and corruption, and their
ileprivation of the joy and adorcunent of life. Hence, there are so many
virtues resulting from th11 ·permissibility of polygao1y, so may Allnh ,curse
whoever intends to view oltberwlse and Irie~ to invlllidote such beneficial,,
lawful matters.

Different Rulings on ~Aarriage
According to the Shad'a/1 (Islamic law), .there are five rulings on
moi:rfage, obligatory, desirable, allbwable, prohibited, and detestable.
Marriage becomes obligatoiry for those who fear committingz/nd (adultery
or for11ication), as marriagi: is a means of chastity and avoidance of what is
prohibited. In this connect ion, Shaylchu1-Ish\m Jbn Taymiyah (may Allah
have mercy on liini) said,.
"if mte is fn Heed of 111arti<1go and he fears com,.,·,ttting ·a sin by
leavittg It, m1e 111ay givt:priority to getting mczrriqge-over performb.1g
obligatory.Pilgrimage,"';

Chapi:c:r l: Marri,ge

J53

Others view d1at marriage, for such .i person. is more preferable 1ha1,
supererogatory Pilgrimage, fasting, or Prayer. They also maintain that in this
ca.se one's financial stare does not matter. Sheikh Taqiyyud-Dtn said:.
':According to the qppar:ent view cif Abmad ,u well as the majority of
scholars, one should not consider wealth before marriage. as Allah,
E;,calted be He. says. •...If t~ey should be poor, Allah will enrich
them from His bounty...~ (Qur'im; An-'Nur: 32) Even the Messenger
of Allah (PBUH) somerimes· had not'1i11g ill h,'$ house as well'. He

(P.BUHJ once conclmfed marriag~ jvf 11 1111.111 who tm1ld not even
1

afford a ring of iron ( as a dowry )."

Marriage becomes desirable •when there is a desire [or libido), but there. is
no fearof,committing unfawful sexual intercourse, as marriage involves many
bene£its for both men and womell,
Marriage becomes allowable when there is no lust, .but there is a desire
for marriage itself, .such as the ca.se With the impotent t!nd the old. However,
In such case~ marriage might be detestable. as it deprives the wife of the
actual purpose of .[!larr-iage, namely safeguarding her chastity, as a husband's
impotency causes a wife great hann.
Marriage beoomes prohibited for a Muslim man who 'lives in a disbelieving
country engaged ma war with Muslims. Marriage in this case may expose his
family to dan_ger ancl being captured by the disbelievers. In addition., he will
not feel secure for his wife living among th~m.
It is an act of the S1mnah (Prophetic Tr.adition) lo marry a religious, chaste
woman of a noble origin. Ab(I i:lurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him)
narrated that the Prophet (PBUH) said:
~ woman is married for four (reasons), lier wealih, her family
status, her beauty, or her religiousness. So, yoa .should h1arry the

reUgio,,s one or else you will be a loser."'
(Related by AL.Jlukh~ri and Muslim)
Moreover, it is: stated that the Pro.phet (PBVH) forbade marrying a woman
for the sa_\teofsomething other than her rel/gi~usness. 'ro illustrate, the Proph~t
(PBUH) said:,

"You sl1ou/d not ,narry women for the sake of their beauty, for
it might lead them to ruin (through a-rtog()nce and concei'I), JWr
.should you marry them for the sake of their wealth, for it might

TheProphet(PBUH) recommendecl •tbat a man marry avirgin. He tPBUH)
said to J~bir (way AUah be pleased with him):

"Why have you no{ matriet./ a 11i1-gi11 so thatyou may pkiy wit/1 /rer
a11d.s/1emay play with you?""
{Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
This is because marrying a virgin involves a_bsolute intim,acy and a.!fection,
as 6he !IJIS no ex-husband to whom her heart mlghrbe attached affecting hllT'
oe6ire and affection for the present husband.
Moreover, ii is considered an act of the S11nnah t!1at one marries a fertile
woman; one of tho.~e women known for their fernndity. Anas (mny Allah be
pleased with him) narl'llred that the Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Marry 1vomen wJ,o are loving and ve,-y prolific, Jo,- I shall be proud
ofthegreatnum/Jerofyo11 (i.e. Muslim nation) in comparison with
(other) 1iations 011 the Day of Resurtectio-n.'1
(Related by An-Nasai and other compilers of Hadithl"
The~ are also other l1adiths carrying.the same meaning.
The ruling pertaining to marriage differs according to the condition Qfthe person, his physical and financial ability, as wel.l as his pre.paredness to shoulder its responsibility. The Prophet (PBUH) exhorts
young people to get married early, as they need It more than other-s do.
He (.l'BUH) said:

-oyoungpeople! Whoevernmongyou has tfie ability to marry should
m,;rry,for it helps i11 lowering one's gm:e and guordi11go11e~ chasti/:;•
(i.e. it guards one's private parts against committing ad(l/tery), m,d
whoever does nol hove the ability t·o morry should fasl, for fasting is
protection for lii,n (as It dimi11isltes one's se.rual desire).'"

(Related by Al-Bukhari_, Muslim, and other compilers ofHPdith)"
ln explaining the nforementioned !J.adifh, some scholars vlew that
"ability" refers to the ability to copulate, while,othe,rs believe that "abili~y"
here refers to the financial ability 10 afford marriage. In addition. the

J55

phrase "for ii helps i11 loweri11g one's gaze." means that marcioge helps lhe
married one to keep away fror.n gazlng at ajnnbiyyahs". Moreover, the
phrnse "and guarding ones chastity" means that :marriage keeps one away
from committing fornication. Then, the Prophet (PBU H) enjoined that
''Whoever does not have the ability to marry" and cannot afford it should
fast, ie. should tesoi:t to performing voluntary fasting as a substitutive
remedy, as fasting ls "protecti<Jn" against committing unlawful sexual
intercourse because it diminishes one's ~exual desire. This is due to the
fact that abstaltil.lig froru food and waler lessens one's lust. In addition to
this, fasting involves a special f.e~ling of piety and fear of Allah, Exahed
be He, Who .says:

"O you who haye believed!, dureed upon yo11 is fasting as it was
decreed upon tl,ose before·you that you ,nay become righteous."
(Qw:'an: Al -Baqarah: 183)
Allah, 81C:1lted be He, also says:

"...Butto fast is bestfo~ ym1, /}'you 011/y k11ew."
(Qul&n: AI-Baqarah! 1!l4)

Ln orief, tl'le Prophet (PBUl-!:) commande\f resisting lust and avoiding
its dangers by resorting to twc, successiye matters. The first one is to
marry when there fa the ability to do so and the second is to resort to
voluntary fasting in case one caa1not afford m~rriage. This indicates that it
is irupennissibte fo~ a m.tn to let him-sd( be exposed to (he dangers of sin~.
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

'l\t1d marry the unmarrie,d among you and tl,e righteous among
your male slaves and femtde JIaves. If they sl,ould be poor, Al/al,
will enrich tl,emfrom His ),ou,ity, and Allah is All-E11compasslr,g

(Related by Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawftd)
He (PBUH) also said:
"Look at her; for it is better that there should be love between you."'
The aforesaid hadiths indicate the permissibility of looking at what
usually appears of the body of one's fiancee furtively and also without sitting
privately with her.
Faqihs say:
"It is deemed allowable for a man who intends to get engaged to a

appears of her body. without s,itting privately with her, provided that
he feels secure against temptation."

"I used to look at lier (i.e. hisfim1ae) secretly, until 1 saw ofher

what in4uced me to man-,, lter."'
This tndicates that a main is not to sit privately wit!\ the woman he intends
to marry, and that he cm look at her stealthily. Yet, one is not allowed to look
except at.what is usually and conventionally apparent of.the body of the woman
,one intends to marry. This :permission ls restrfoted to the per.son who thinks
that the woman is likely to l'espond to his proposal of marriage. Otherwise, if
it is no! attainable for the person 'lo have a look at the woman he intends to
m11r~y. he may send a trustworthy woman to see heir on his behalf, and then
she may describe her to him. This is based on the l!adith related by Jmam
Ahmad stating that the Pmphet (PBUH) once sent Umrn Sulaym in order to
see and examine a woman•.
Whoever is asked about: his oeinion on someone i1ltended to be engaged
should answer honestly, me ntionlng the bad qualities of the intended pecson
(if any) as well as any rele•vant things, which is not considered backbitiqg
in rhi~ case.
lt is prohibited for a man to use direct declaration while proposing to a
widow or a divorced woman during her waiting period. such a,s sayjng to her;
'"l would like to marry you:'' This is because, Allali, Exalted be He, says:

"There is no blame upon you for that to which you [lnd/,-ec{ly]
allude concertling a propo-sal to women ..."
(Qllr'an;, AI-Baqarah: '2~5)
Hence, Ailab, Exalted bl! He, allows indirect allusion wliile proposing lo a
widow or a divorced wom911 during her waiting period, such as saying to her;
·•r am interested in you;' or· suchlike indirect expre.ssiOJ16. This indicates the
prohibition of direet declaration of proposal to a widow or a divorced woman
dnring her waiting period, s:uch as saying, ~1 would like to marry you'.' This is
because such a diteet proposal LO a widow or a divorced woman may urge her
to lie about her waiting period out of her desire for marriage.
Imilm lbnuJ-Qayyim sa:id:
~Al/air proliibited di reel prop1Hal of marriage'lo a widow or Q t/ivorced

On the other hand. proposing to a widow or a divorced woman during her
waiting period, whether through .allusion or direct proposal ls permissible
for him {i.e. the divorce) who has divorced her irrevocably but less than
three limes, as he is allowed' to remauy !-,er during her waiting period. In this
respect, Shaykhul, lsllm Taqiyylid-Dln said, "AUusion ,is well as aircct proposal

Is permissible/or the one (i;e. divorce) who has 1/,e right to marry herdurfr1g her

II is prohibiteii for a Musiim to propose to a woman who is already engaged
lo another Muslim. Thus, whoever proposes to a woman and his proposal Is
answered, jt become.s prohipited for anyoue e),~e to propose to her until \he
first suitor gives him permission ()t when tbe proposal of the first is rejected
'Fbe Prophet (PBUH) said:

Moreover, lbn 'lfmar narrated that the Prophet (PBUH) said:
''None should ask far tl1e band of a wo11ian i~ho is already engageq

This is the duty of a Mu.slim towards the sanctity and inviolability of his

Marriage Contract:
Integrals and Conditions
It is desirable to deliver a sermon before concluding the marriage contract.
This sermon is caUed "the Sermon of Ibn Mas' i1d''. It may be delivered by
the one who concludes the contract or by anyone else of the attendants. Its
wording is as follows:

"VerilJ\ all praise be to Allah; we praise Him, ask His help and forgive ness, and turn to Him in repentance. We seek refuge with Him from
the evils of ourselves, and from the evils ofour deeds. Whomever Allah
guides, for him there is 110 misleader, and whomever He leads astray,
for him there is no guide. I testify that tl1ere is no deity but Allah, and I
testij'y that Mub.ammad is His Servant and Messe11ger."
(Related by the Five Compliers of Hadith, and deemed a b.asan

After delivering theJiermon, the followi ng three verse of AUah's Book, the
Qur'an, are to be recited. The first verse is:
"O you who have be,lieved, fear Allah ,u He should be feared a11d
,to not die except as Muslims [in submission to Him]:'
(Qur'an: Alu 'Imran: J 02)
The second one is:
"O mankind, fear J'0•11r Lord, Wlw created yo11 from one soul a11d
createdfrom ii its 111trtea11d dispersedfrom both ofthem many men
and women. Andfear Alla/1, through Whom, you ask one another,
and t/10 wombs. l11d1,ed Alltih Is ever, over yo~ an Observe~•
(Qur'lin: An-Nisa': 1)
'!'he third is:
"O j1ou who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of
apprapriatejustic;~ Hemll [then] amendforyou your duds
and forgive you y,1111r sins. Arid whoever obeys Allah at1d
His Messenger has ,certainly attained a gre4t attt1inment."

(Qur'~n: Al-AhzAb: 70-71)

The Three Integral Parts of Marriage
First: Spou~es must be:free from any barriers tbat may deter the validity
of their marriage. For example. the woman must not be one of those
whom the l)rospective groom is pron,ibited to marry, such as being a
close blood relative (marrying whom ls incest), being a sister through
having been breast-fed by the same woman, or being a widow or
a divorced woman in ber waiting period, and the like. Another
e.x.ampl~ is that the man mus\ not be a disbeliever while the woman is
a believer. There ar1: SQU'.le other legal barriers that we will shed light
on, if Allah wills.
Second: The brlde's consent mµst be verilied. )t is expressed fhrougb the
spoken fotm uttered.by the legal gun.rdian of the bride or anyone in his
place; he says to the groom. "lmarry you so-and-so:•
Thinl: The groom's acc.epiance must be verified. It is ex;pressed through
the spoken form Utt,~d by the gmom i.n reply to the guardian, namely,
"I marry her;' or "l accept her marriage:

Chapter 3: Mmia9c Contrru:1: lmq;r.ili aod 01,1dl1Jo11s

Shaykhul-lsl/Un lbn Taymiyah and his <lisciple JbnuJ-Qayyim m~int~ined
that marriage can be <;oncluded by,an,y won.ling thal lndicatcs the s-arne meaning
of the aforementioned spoken fo,nns, and that iL is not restricted to them.
However, thpse scholars who made the spoken forms of marriage restricted to
the-aforementioned onl's argue that ''marriage" is explicitly referred to in. the
Qur!an , witl1out irnplioitioll; Allah, Exaheil be He. says:
''. ..So 111he11 Zoyd had 110 longer a11y need for lier, We ma,-rie1/
her to you ..."
fQu.r'a.n; Al-Ahz;ib: 37)
AJl;ih ,uso s~ys:

'l-i11d do 1wt many tl,ose {Women] wlwni yo11rfatlien married..."
(Quram Ai1-Nisa': 22)
In fact, this does not mean that marrtngc is not to be consi1mmated except
thro'1gb these spoken forms.; and Allah knows best.
A marriage contract is decmi,d valid for a mute when the iegal form of
con6ent or acceptance is expressed through writing or understood gest Ul'e.
Wheo mutual consent and acceptance are reached, marriag~ is to be.
deemed vali<! e.ven if the une uttierlng the legaf spoken form of marriage is

The Four Conditions for U1e V~dilf of Marriage
1~ Accurate Specification of the Two Spouses
Each of th.e two spouses must be accurately ~pecified while referri.l)g
to them. For example, it l~: insufficient for II bride's father to say to the
groom 1\5 a leg<1l spol<en !form. "I marry you m.y daughter," while he
has many daLl_ghters. Stmilarl)', he cannot say lo Lhe groom's fatlJCJ;
"l marry my daughter to your son," while the latter has many sons.
Accordingly, the spouse re:ferred to must be aocura\dy-spedfied either
by pointing at him/her, r eferring to him/her by mentioning his/her
name, or mentioning a ceirtal11 qu;ility that distinguishes him/Iler.

MARRIAGE.

2- Mutual Consent
There must be mutual consent between the two s1muses; marriage is
no\ deemed valid if any of the iwo °is forced IQ accept it To JIJustrate,
Abll Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with 'lum) narrated th.ii the
Prophet (PBlJH) said:
'ti previously marri,?d woma11 should not be given itt marriage except

after considt111g her; and .a virgitJ 5hould n.ot be given in marriage
except after lier per,nissio11."
(Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)

This is ;1pplied except for the minor who hus not.•reached malllrity Or
the insane, as the legal g_uardian can marry any 6[ them without their
permission.

3- The Bride't Guanlian'11Permission
A woman is to be given in marriage by tl\e peqni5sion of her
legal guardian. This is dne to the hadtth of the Prophet (PBtfH)
in which he says:

"No marriage (is vaUd) without (tlie permission of) a guardian..."
(Related by the five Compliers of l:iadith except An-Nasii'i) •

Consequently. if a woman gives herself in marriage without a legal
guardian, her marriage is regarded as itwalid, as such an act is a means
leading to unlawful sexual inter£ourie. This is becat15e a woman
is considered parti;1lly unable to choose' her best-suited husband.
ln rhis respect, Allah, Exahed be He, addresses legal guardians of
women saying:
"And marr)I the 1.m11;«1•rled on,ong you ...ff

(Qur'An: An-N"tir:32)
Allah also says;

·"... Do nutprn,ent tl,emfrom r;,morrying...»
(Qulin: Al-Baqarah: 232.)
The.re are some othe•r ve1·ses in the same regard.

Cli•ptcr 3: Marriage ·Contrac.t: L,ceg,~ls Md Condition,

The legal guardian of:i woman is assigned according to this order:
• Her father
• The one authorized by the fot:her to be her guardian

• Her paternal gr:indfathe·r or one of h1s paternal male ascendants
• Her son or one of hj5 paternal !'hale descendants

• Hel' fQU brother

• Her paternal brother
• A son of her full or_pate·rnal brothers

• Her father's full brother
• Her father's pntern~J brdther
• A son of her father's ful1 or paternal brother
• The·closest agnate relati've

• Heremandpator

• 'J'he ruler
4- The P{esence of'Two Witne·sses

The marrfage wntraci 1p,ust be witnessed due to the /!adfth narrated
hy labir which states that lthe Prophet (PBUH) said:
"No martiage (is valid) 111itlto1ct (the pen11issio11 vf) a guardian and

Equivalenice in Marriage

The two spouses must be e<11uivalent in four things:
1- Religiousness
A defiantly disobedient or a corrupt person is not a suitable match for
a chaste, virtuous woman. This is because the testimony or report of such a
person i.s rejected, which is conside:red a sign of inferiority.

2-Freedom
A slave (or a slave who is partially free due to his agreement with his
master to be fuUy free after the payment of a certain amount of money or after
his master's death) is not a suitable: match for a free woman, as the former is
inferior due to slavery.

Vl MARRIAGe

368

3- Profession
Oneof-al6wlyprofession, suchasacupper ora weaver, is not a suitable
match for a daughter of orne in a high prof-ession, such :is a merchant or
a businessman.

4-Solvency
The groom should be sc,lvent enough lo afford the dowry and marriage
e~enses. That is, an insolvent man is not a suitable match for a prospetous
wollliln, 11s chi~ AIU~ her ha1m O'Ving to his inability to meet bet due e,cpenses.
Accordingly. if the condiition of any of the two spouses is different from
th11t of the other with regard to any of the above-mentioned four matters,
eqqivalence is violated. However, this d~s not affect the validity of marriage,
a.s equivalence is not a condition for it& validity; To illustrate, the Prophet
1
(PBUH) instructed P~!imah Bini Qays to ma.rry Us~mah lb11 Zayd, so their
marriage was consummated due to the Prophets command regardless of their
1
in&1uality . Yet, equivalenc1: is still regarded as a condition required for a
spouse's commitment to the marriage agreement For example, if a woman was
given in marriage to someone who is not a suitable match for her. she or any of
bedegal guardians who do mot con~ent to such an inequality may cancel the
marriage c;ontract At the ltfotime of the Prophet (PBUH), it happened that a
man married his daughter 10 his nephew in order to raise the latter's meilllllesS
and low status, so the Prophet (!>BUH) gave her the right of option who:tber to
stay with him or to be separated'. Still, some seholars maintain that equivalence
is a condition for the validity of marriage., such as lmi1m Ahmad according to
one of the opinions attributed to him.

Sheikh Taqiyyud-Din said;
'';l,ccording -to the opinio" of lmtim Ah.rn.ad, if.the husband, turns 011t
to be unequal to the wife, they are to be separated. Morecver, the
guardian does 11ot have• the right to n,atry t/1e woman who is under
his guardianship (daughter, sister, etc.) to a matt that is 110L a suitable
match for her. Similar/)\ it is impermissible for a man or a woman to
marry a,1 unsuitable m:atc/1. Also, according to Ahmad, equivalence
is notjustlike marital.financial matters such as the dowry t/u1t !/ti!
bride or any ofherlegaJ:'guardinns may demand or disregard. Rdther,.

A free Muslim man is prohibited tt'I marry a slave Musllm woman,.as such
a marriage causes his childivn to be slaves of his wife's master. It is permissible
to marry a slave Muslim woman only when one.fears committing fornication
:ind one cannot afford man~ying a free Muslim wciman or afford the price of a
slave woman to emancipate and marry he!'. Allah, f':xalted be Be, says:

A slave is prohibited to marry his mistress according to the consensus of
Muslim scholar-s. Tfiis js because being a mistress of a sieve contradicts being
hi.s wif~. as the rights, duties, and rulings are different in each case. Similarly,
a master is prohibited to marry his slave gfrl. 'Fhls is because the contract
of possessing a woman is stronger than that of marrying her; and a ~!tong
cotitract cannot be ootubined with a weaker one.
Baving sexual intercourse with une's slave girl.ha~ the Same ruling as having
sexual intercourse through a marriage contract, provided the aforementioned
conditions are considered. In other words. those who are temporarily prohibi~
for one to marry - such as a Widow or a divorced woman in her waiting period,
a muhrim woman, a female fomiclltor. ov a woman whom one has divorced
thrice - are prohibited for one to have sexu·aJ intercourse with as -one's slave
women. 'This is because if a marriage contract is prohibited as a means of
lawful sexual intercomse in such cases, then having sexual intercourse with
one's slave woman, with gtea1er reason, is prohibited ,n thes~ cases .as well.

Conditions Made Before Marriage

They are conditions set in the marriage contract by one of the two spouses
to be fulfilled by the other in the best interest of the former. They are stipulated
whether through the marriage contract or any previous agreement. Such
conditions are of two kinds:

First: Valid Conditions
According to the majority of faqihs, it is a valid condition when a woman
stipulates that her suitor must divorce his first wife, as such a divorce is in her
interest. Other scholars view that such a condition is invalid, as tile Prophet
(PBUH) forbade a woman to ask for the divorce of another woman so as to
take her place as a wife'. This Prophetic forbiddance indicates the invalidity of
such a condition.
Among the valid conditions made by a woman before marriage is when
she stipulates that her suitor must not (sexually) enjoy a slave girl or marry

VI MARRIAGE-

380

another woman after their. marriage. This is a valid condition that has to be
fulfilled by the husband; otherwise, she has the right to Invalidate the marriage.
In this regard, the Prophet (PBUH) said:

''Tire worthiest con4itions to be fa/filled ,qre those that make it
legal
fat you IC 11ave2 sexual relations (i,e, the conditions set it, the
•
marriage contract)."
Amongsuch valid conditions is when the bride stipulates that,her suitor
must not take her out of her house or homeland. Thus, the man musi nor
take her ollt exc~pt by her permissir;m in accordance with her conditlon,
Likewise, lt isa valid condition ifthe bride.stipulates that her future husband
must not separate between her and her cbildre11 or parents. This condition
must be fulfilled by the huHband; otherwise, she has the right to resc;ind the
marriage co11tract
It is also a valid condition ifahe bride stipulates a larg,u amount of dowry
or that the dowry must be paid in a certain currency. 'This is a valid and
binding condition that the groom must fulfill; otherwise, she has the tight to
invalldate the marriage contract. Thus, she has the option to invali~te it at
anytime she likes, unless there is a sig,:i of her consent although being aware
of his violation of her condition. In such a case, her right of choice is to be
disregarded. In this regard, •Umar Thnul-Kha,ttllb (may Allah be pleased with
him) obliged a man to fi1lflUwhat his wtfe made as a condition before tl\ei'r
marriage. 'The rrian said:

"They (women) may di,,orce us then!" •Vmar answered, "The
judgment on rights is based upon the slated co11ditions.")
This view is also supported by the liaditli of the P~ophet (,PBUH) in which
he says:

"Muslims must keep to the conditions they have made.••
The great scholar lbnul-Qayyim said:

"Such conditions must be kepi, a.s they are the worthiest to befulfilled
according lo the principles of Shari· ah (Islamic Law),, reasoning,
and sound analogic,;il deduction. Hence, if the woman does not
consent to give herself to someone except 011 ,a certain co11dition,
Stich acondition must be fulfilled; otherwise, the marriage contrp,;t
will not be esta6/ished 011 her consent, and it will make her liable
for uncalled for duties that are not enjoined on her by Allah and
His Messenger."'

separated in thls case, whether they stated that there is no dowry paid

Still, if there is a certain dowry given separately to each of the two
brides, without any intention of ,heating, provided that each of the
rwo brides gives h~r 1;on8~nl, 6Uch ~ marriage then is deemed valid, as
the causative of harm is no longer there.

will divorce lier ,;,nc:e this purpose is achieved, Whether there is a
condition stated in the marriage or agreed uponbeforecortduding the
,contract or not, such marriage is cleemtid invalid anyway according
to the following l:!_adllth:
"The Prophet (PBUH) s11id tu /1is.Compa11ions, 'Shal/'1 tellyo11 about tire

.3.-The Mattlage Depemdent on a Future Condition

An exam.pie of $uc'li marriage ls when the guardian of the woman
.says to the suitor, '1 wiJJ let you marry her when the first of so-andso month comes~ or "'. .. If her mother .:onsents." Su& a marriage
contract is deemed invalid, for marriage is considered a contract of
compensation ( represented in the dowry that rnakes ii' lawful for the
rnaa to enjoy the w\:lman as a wifo). Therefore, it is invalid t,;, malce
such a contrat l dependent on a future possibility. Similarly, it is i nvalid
to make the marriag11 contract temporary, as when a guardian .says to
the s;,itor, "I -will le:t ;1'01.1 marry her on the <:ondition that )'OU divorce

Cbaprer 6: Co11didon, Made IJ.efore Mairriage

he.r tomouow," or. "I will let.)l'ou marry her.for a tnonth (or a year):'
Such temporary marriage is what Is cdllcd "marriage of mut'a/J~ j.e.
the temporary marriage lqtended just for having sexual intercourse.
Sheikh Taqiyyud-Dln -saicll:
"All the many elaborate tm,t11w,ltir (conti1u1ous/y recurrent) /iadiths
agree that Allah E.wlted be fie, prohibited' the marriage of mut •al,
(temyorary marriage) afie,· It had been made lawful.""

Moreover, Al•Q11rtub1 said:
''All'f!adfths agree that the fime,when /he marriage of,nut'ah wns lmvfi1/
did 1101 lastfor long, as it Wl1Ssoon prohibited. Then, both the Sala/(early
Muslim scholars) and the Khalaf (/ale Muslim sc/wlars) unanimously
agree 011 its prohibition, ex.ceptfar tl1ose scholars oftqe Ritfig_ah" whose
cpinion counts for nollring."

B- Invalid Conditions that do not Invalidate Marriage
If there i's a condition int.he 1t'llarriage contract that involves violating
any of the woman's rights, such a condition is invaiid though the marriage
itself is still deemed valid. Exarnples of such invalid c-onditions tha t do
not invalidate marriage are the ,cases when the man stipulates that there
will be no dowry for the woma(l or that there will be no alimony for her,
or that the nights he will spend with her will be less than those ol' her
fellow wife. Though S\lCh conditions are invalid, tbey do nor invalidate
the marriage.. as they are of additional meaning to the marriage contra.ct
Thus, mentioning them in the· contract is not necessary, and ignoring
them is not harrnfi.tl.
For instance, if the suitor 1nalkes a conditio11 that the woman must be a
Muslim,. and then she turns out to be one ofthe People of the Scripture, i.e. a
Christian or a Jew, the marriage i:t1 thls case is valid, and the husband has lhe
d1oice whether to invalidate it 01· ,not. Similarly, if the suitor stipulates that
the woinan must be a virgin, a pretty woman, or a womali of noble origin,
'<lI!d then he discovers that she i:~ otherwise, he has fhe right to invalidate the
marriage. as hi~ condilion ls not fulfl1Jed.

Defects in Spouses

There are defects that if found in one of the married couple, the other
has the right of option whether to cancel the marriage contract or not. The
following are some examples:
• If a wife finds out that her husband is unable to copulate with her
due to his impotency, she has the right to rescind the marriage
contract. In addition, if a woman claims that her husband is
impotent and the latter does not deny it, t~e husband is to be
given a chance for a year (to copulate with her) . Yet, if he st.ill
could not copulate with her during that period, she has the right
to rescind the marriage contract.

• If the husband finds that his wife is afflicted with a shortcoming
that hampers copulation, such as colpatresia, and that such a
defect is incurable, the husband then has the right to rescind the
marriage contract.

386

• If one of the two spouses finds a defect (n tl1e other. such as hemorrhoids,
insanity, vitlligo, leprosy. baldness, or halitosis, tbe_forml!l' then has
the right of ch.oice v1hether to canoe! the ptnrriage contract or not due
to the repulsion caused by such defects.
The great scholar lbnul,Qayyim said,

"Every defecr that caus·es a spouse to be disirtdined w the other and
prevents the fulf,llment of the purpose of mart;iage (i.e. copulatiqnJ
entails the right of rho/Ge (whether to cancel It or not). lnvalidatio11
111 this case is wortliie, 11,oi, i!,e invalidation of a trade transaction
(d11e to a defcct)."'
1

The rigbt of option to r•~scind the marriage contract is ,due to the spouse
who d11es not acrept the defect of the other; e11en ff the fo11ner has a similar
ot a different defect. This is bec~use man does not feel disgusted with bis own
defects. However. if111ty of the married couple accepts the defect of the. other,
provlded being aware of the, defec.t and showing a sign of acceptance such as
saying, "I accept that defect:' such a spouse dues not have the right of option
to rescind the marriage contract (due to that defect) afterwards.
When one of the marri1?d couple has the right of option (to rescind the
marriage contract or nor) , t.b,e execution must be done by the judge (or the one
in authority), as such a mattt:r needs ijtlhad and co nsideration. Thus, th~Judge
(or·the one in at1thority) can r~sci.nd lht: marriage contract lf demanded by the
claimant spouse, or give the latter permission to do so.
If the contract is rescin<led before the consummation of marriage, the
wife docs not have the rig.hi: to claim her dowry. This is because if sh~ is the
claimant ofthe rescinding c,f the marriage contract, then she is the one who
causes: separation. On the o ther h~nd, if the husband was the claimant of the
rescinding, then it me.ins that .she has nor told him about lter defect. In both
case.s, she does not have the i:ight to claim her dowry. However; if Ute marriage
is rescinded after consummation, the wife has tbe right t o. dailn th¢ dowry
specified in the marriage contract. This is because the wifes dowry becomes
ob!igator.y for being slated in contract-and settled by the consummation ofthe
marriage-(i,e. having sexual intercourse). Thus, the dowry becomes t1te wife's
rlgbt and cannmbe invalidated in thls c-..ise.

It is invalid to many a.yo,ung girl, an 1mrane woman, ora shive girl, to ll man
who is afflicted with a defect that affec.ts the consummation of the rnarii;ige.
T his is heornse the guardian is supposed to look for the best Interest of the

woman under his guardianship. Yet, if th~ guardian is not acquainted with 1he
suitors defect, he is to rescind the marriage contract once he knows abou1 it in
order to space the woman under his guardianship the harmfitl consequences,
In this connection, ifa sane, mature woman gives her conseptto,marry,an
impotent man Or one whose penis.lsamputated, the guardian does nor have the
rlgh1 to prevent the marriuge, os sexual inlercourse is a matter thut concerm
the bride al9qe, no one dse. However, ifshe accepts to marry an insane person,
a 'leper, or a man afflicted with vftiligo, her guardian can prevent the marriage
in this case, as fhe negative e~t~ of the husband's def-ei:r may ei.ceed the wife
to befall their children, in additiop to the blemish that moy befall !he family.

Marriage of Disbelievers

"Disbelievers" here refers to the Christians, the fews, and the people of
other belief.~ such as magi and idolaters. This chapter deals with the rul.ings
on the marriages of such disbelievers if they convert to Islam or seek the
judgment of the Islamic judiciary concerning marital cases while they are still
disbelievers.
The rulings on the marriages of the disbelievers are the same as those
on the marriages of Muslims with respect to validity, divorce, ~ihar,' ilti','
alimony, and the nights one spen!ls with one's wives. That is to say, the women
a disbelieving man is prohibited to marry are the same as those prohibited for
a Muslim man to marry (such as the mother, the sister, etc). This is because the
disbelieving married women are referred to as "wives" in the Qur'an; Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
~nd his wife [as wellJ- the carrier offirewood!'
(Qur'dn: Al-Masad: 4)

Vl MARRIAGE

390

Allah also says:
''And the wife ofPluimoh said,- ''

(Qur~: AI-Qaia~.: 9)

Hence, referring to tho:,e disbelieving women as "wives'' in the Qufan
indicates the vaiidity of theil: marriage.

Shaykhul-lslAm lbn Tay miyl!h (m~y Allah have mercy on him) said:
"The sound opinion is that the marriages of dM,elievers which are
Vi!'Wed prohibited in (i:/11m are a/>solutely Prohibited On any other
religiM). lft/.tey.do not (:o,ivert to Tslmn,.t/Jey will be punishedfor them
(in the Hereaftet), but i( they become MusUms, they will be pardoned
for them, as they have bee11 unaware of the prohibi/fon of such
marriages. As for the vailidity or fnvalidity ofsuch marriages, they are
viewed 1•a/ld from one ,perspective nnd invalidfrom another. Tj what
is meant by vali,iity ls Ihe. iawft1/ness oftaking full responsibility as a
couple and folfil/i11g th,i marriage con/met, then t'/re validity of their
marriage in tltis case is dependent 011 its eonsummaHon accordiT1g
to the Islamic regulati,•t1$. Howe,•er, if whqt is, 11reant by validity is
tile enforceability of tit,: ntlings pertaining to marriage, suclr /15 the
resdndment of the marriage contract due to a threefold Irrevocable
divorce, the ejfectivenes,; ofdivorce, and the esuiblishment ofmarriage
and tl1e remlta11t chasti I)\ the11 tire marriage is deemed valid,...,
Among the r ulings on the disbelievers' marriages is that their invalid
marriages are to be concede,d to on two condltions:
a. Their invalid marria~;es are to be conceded (by Mi1sllms) if they believe
them to be valid in their creed. Whatever marriages they do uot de~m
valid are oot to be c~,nceded, as they are not admitted in thefr religion.
b. Their iJlVlllid marriages are to be conceded as long as they do not seek
the judgment of th,e lslamk judici<\J'y in th is concern. But if th~y do.
the Muslims are not to concede sµch mar,iages. This is because.Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
"And judge, {O Mt1b.ammad), between the.n1 by what Alla/1
has revealed ..."
(Qur'an: Al-Ma'idah; 49)

Jnthjsl'egard, if the dlisbelieversbelieve in thevnlldltyoftheir marriages
according to their ~;reed and do not seek the Jslamjc judgment, we
are not to disapprove of them. To illustrate. theProphet (PBUH) took
jizya/, from the maj~ of Hajar and dtd 1101 object to their marriages

Chapter 8: Marri•r,e of Oisb,Ucvers

.!9l

although he (PBUH)· kntrw that ~ey allowed marrying \),eir legally
unrriarriageable kin'. In <1.ddition, many people converted lo Islam bl
the lifetime of the Prophe:t (PBUI--i) and he conceded their marriages
without poin1ing out ·the way they were consummated.
If a disbelieving couple come,; to Muslims seeking their judgment before
lhe consummation of their morrfagc, Muslims are to condude lt lll accordance
with the religion oflsl.1rn, Le. Oie1:e must be the groom's spoken proposal, the
·b.nde's consent, the llride's guirrdi:m, and two e-quitable M\nlim witnesses.
Allah, Exalted be H~ s'l.y5;
•~ .. And ifyou judge, judg,f between the111 with j,tstice..."
(Qur'~n: Al-Ma'idah: 42)

However, if a d'isbelievlng ccoupt'e seeks the Islamic judgment after the
consummation of their marriage, Muslims are not to object to the manner of
its consummation.
Similarly, if tne two disbelieving spouses convert to Islam, Muslims are
not to ·objed to the way tlteir marriage was consummated or whether the
conditions for its validity were t~)ere or not. R.ather, if such a couple comes
seeking the Islamic judgment t-egarding their marriage, Muslims are t6
consider that matter at the time when they seek the Islamic judgment or ,t he
time oftheir conversion to Islam. Hen~e. if the wife then is among tbe women
lawful for her husband to marry as a Muslim without any legal barrier, ,the
marriage is to be approved ol'. Since there has been no leg;ll barrier from the
beginning, there ls nothing to pn,vent malntaining their morrfuge after thefr
conversion to [slam. Yet, if the wife is origln.!lJy prohibJted for the man to
marry {ar the ti-me 1\lhen they seek the fslamic judgment or al the time of their
conversion to Islam ), they are to be separated. This is because the invalidity
of theJt marriage contract from the beginning causes the p.rohibition of lls
being continued.

As for the dowry specified for the wife before their conversionto f.slam, if
it i.5 something lawful, she c11n !\.ive 1t, for ii is h~r d11e right according to,the

marriage contract, and there is n,o legal reason preventing its being given t!l
her. However, if the dowry is som,:lhing corrupt or unlawful, such as wine and
swine, there w.ill be two rulings:

First, if the wife has aiready received it as·her dowry, then it is deemed
fulfilled, i.e. she is not entitled to get something instead, as she has
received h ac,;ofding to tli~fr p~viou~ cr~ed (l e. disbelief). Thus, the

392

V1 MARRIAGE
obligation of the dowry is deemed fulfilled on the part of the husband.
Moreove.r, lf MusUms ra1se their objection on mch matters, it will
cause difficulty and disincline people to convert 10 Islam. T herefore,
such matters are pardoned due to 1he married couple's conversion to
Islam just like all oiher aets d.isbeUevers used to practice before their
conversion to Islam.

Second, if the wife has not got such an unlawful dowry then, a proper lawful
dowry liRe lbat given to ones like her is to be specified for her. However,
if she hu already received part of her unlawful dowry d111ing the time
of.disbelief, the other part fs to be estimated and given to her according
to the proper lawful dowry like that given to ones like her. Similarly, if
her d6wry has not been specified before convertii1g to Islam, then she1s.
to receive a proper lawful dowry like that given to opes IU<e her; as it is
invalid not to specify a dowry in the marriage contract
Moreover, if the two spouses convert to Islam at the same tlme, their marri;1ge is 10 be maintained, as thereis no religious distinction between them.
Furthermore, if the husband of a Christian or a JewL~h woman converts to
Islam whereas she does not, their marriage is to be mainraiaed, as a Muslim
man is originally allowed ro marry a Chri&tian or a Jewish woman, so ii is valid,
with gr~ater reason, \o maintain h~rus a wife after the }ius!Y<ind's conversion
to Islam,
On the other hand, if a .disbelieving woman convects to Islam while being
married to a disbeliever and before the consummation of marriage, their
marriage is invalidated. Ailah, £.,alted be He, says:
". .. then do 11ot reti,r11 01em'to the disbtdk.vers; they are not lawftll
[wi1•es]for them, nor are they lawful [ltiut11,nds) for them.•."

(Qur'an: AI-Mumtahinah: IO)
Accordingly, the woma:!l ln tl1ts case du~s not have the. right to claim her
dowry, as the rescindment of marriage is on !\er part.
Similarly; if a husband of a disbelieving woman. who is neither a Christian
nor a Jew, converts to Islam before the consummation of marriage, their
marriage: 1s invalidatei!. Allah, Exalted be He, -Says:

~-.And holsl'notto marriage bon4s with disbelieving womm.. .''
(Qur'an: Al-Mumtahinah: IO)

Cb~pr.,r St M.rri,gc of 0i<b¢lli,v¢r$

393

l n this case, the man has to Pll:Y her half the dowty, as the rescindment of
marriage is on his part
rn this connection, if one of tll1e two disbelieving spouses, who are neither
Christians not' Jews, converts to Islam, or if a disbelieving woman converts
10 Islam after the consummation of her marriage to a disbeliever, the matter
becomes depc11denr on the wife's waiting period. In other words, if one of
them converts to Islam during the wife's waiting period, their marriage is to
be maintained as valid. However, if the other spouse does not.convert to Islam
during that period, thdr marri11ge is deemed invalid since one spouse has
converted to Islam.
ln addition, he who converts lo Islam whiie having more than fou1· wive~
who have converted to !slam too, or who are Christians or Jews, has to choose
only four of!hem to ke,ep as wives. This is baged on the fact that when Qays
Ibnul-H~rith converted to Islam 'while having eigbt wives, the Prophet ('PBLJH)
said to h1m , "Select four (wlves to keep) of tliem:,; The Prophet {PBUH) IM!id
the same to others on 5irnilar occasions. And, Allah know~ best.

Dowry

Jurlstically, the word dowry refers to a kind of compensation specified
in the marriage contract or after concluding it, and it is to be paid by the
husband. As for its ruling, it is obligatory according to the Qur'an, the Swmah
(Prophetic Tradition) and the consensus of Muslim scholars. Allah, Exalted
be He, says:

"And give the women [upon marriage] tlteir [bridal] gifts
graciously. But if they give up willingly to you anything of it,
then take it in satisfaction and ease." (Qur'an: An-Nisa': 4)
Moreover, the Prophet (P'BUH) never let a marriage be consummated in
his lifetime withont a dowry. In this regard, he (PBUI-1) said to a suitor:

"Find something ( to give the bride as a dowry), even if it is an

iron rmg.
In addition, all Muslim scholars uniformly agree on its legality.

396

VT MARRIAGE

As for l:helegal amount ofdowry, it has no specific minimum or maximum .
Wbatevet is valid to be g.iven as ~ pdee or a wage is valid to be given as a
dowry, regardless of its amount, S1ill, we &bouJd follow the example of the
Propht.t tPBUH} regarding dowries, verifying that a dowry should be about
2
four hundred du-Ii.ams of silver, like the dowries given to the daughters of the
Prophet ( PBUH)'.
Shaykhul-ts1am Ibn Taymiyah (may Aliahhave mercy on hirn) said:

"If the dowry g{ven is much, it is not deemed detestable as long as the
groom Is able to afford I~ unless tire lai-ge amount of dowry is offered
for detestabie purposes, such as boastfulness, showing off, and the
like. However. if the groom is unable to afford such a large dowry, it
is detestable for him to present it Moreover, such a matter is viewed
prohibited if the dowry ca1tnot be att,1ined except through begging or
$Uc/rlike prohibited means. If tJ,e amount of dowry is much and it fs
deferred to be paid later, it s.ltould be deemed detestable also dt1e to
the difficulty caused lo the groom by the liability burdened."'
Ih brief; giving a large am.o unt of dowry is qot deemed detestable as long.
as it is not out of boastfulness illld extravagance, and it doesc nor burden the
groom causing him to ask others for financial help and suchlike. In addition, a
large amount of dowry is not deemed detestable so long as it does not burden
the groom with heavy debts. These nre valuable regulations and cd!eria rhat
ensure well-being and ellminate harm.
A<;cordingto the above, lt becomes evident that exaggeration, excessiveness,
and extn1vagance in demanding large dowries .ate undoubtedly deemed
detestable or even ,prohibited. 1his is because demanding such large dowries
does- not consider the condition of ,poor men, and so tt h,as become a major
obstacle ln the wuy of marriage. In addi tion, there are many other unnecessary
marital expenses such as the purchase of expensive clothes and jewelries,
holding e.'tpeasive wedding receptions and banquets, etc. fn fact, such matters
involve nothing but lavishness, exlTavagance, and wastefulness, as they are -.oid
of any benefit to any of the$pouses. Undoubtedly, such matters a:re•considered
among the burdens, obstacles, and bad traditions that must be avoided and
eliminated to clear the obstacles st.iading in the way of marriage.
In this connection, ' A'ishah (may Allah be please-d with her) narrated that
the Prophet (PBUH) said:

«The most blessed ofwomen are those with less exptnditure (i,1
·dowries, 1•Iarri11ge, living, etc.)."'
(Related by Ahmaq, AJ-Bayhaqi, Ai•Hnkini and 6tbers}

Chapter 9: Dowfy

397

Moreover, ' Umar Ibnul-Khatt~,b (may Allah be pleased with rum) said;

'"Do not go to extremes conc1imi11g the dowries of women, for if it
tepresented honorin this wodd and piety in the Sig'1t ofA1lah, the
one of you most entttled to do so would have been the Messenger
of Allah (PBUH). He (PBUU) did not frlarry ,my of his wives or
conclude the ma·rrtage of any ofhis daughte_rs for more than twelve
1iqfyyahs•. Verily, the man l!tight be uverburdened with the dowry
of his wife until there could be an enmity toward her-In hit heart
and he )'IOtdd say. 'f nave be~m de111arided /0 get (~verythlng e,,en)
the hanger of water skin"'
( R,elated by An-Nasa'i and Abu Daw,'.1d)
l!l fact, extravagance in dowrfeiS may drive the husband to dislike nis wife
whenever he recalls the huge amou.n t ofdowry he had fo giVe to her. Therefore
the most blessed of women are those with less expenditure (in downes.,
maFriage, :living, etc).
This is as in the Prophetic }raditlt narrated by •A'ishah. Accordingly, sim·
plicity and easiness in dowries re~mlt in the w1ves being blessed and endear
them to their husbands.
'The legal puliJ)ose behind tl.ie legality of tbe dowry stated for marriage is
that it ls considered a compensatlo,n given to the woman due to the husband~s
so-uil intercourse wi.th het In aclditi.on, the dowry i.s considered a sign o [
honor granted to the wife showlng that she ls .respected and highly esteemed
by her husband.
ft is desirable to specify and state the amount of dowry in the marriage
contract to avoid anr possible dispute that might arise. Nevertheless, it is
permissible to,speci.fy and state it biter, after concluding the marr iag~ contract,
for Allah,.Exalted be He, says:

"Thert is no blame. upon you If}'OU divorce women you have net
to,u;hed. 11or specified for them. an obligation...~
{Qur'An: Al-Baqar.ah: 236)
Tbi.s verse· indicates that the ~Qwry can be deterred and stated later after
the marriage.
As regartls the quality and nature of the Jowry, it is obvious that whatevet
is permissible to b~ given as " price, a wage, or a rent, is penni'ssible to be
offered as a dowry. Thus. a dowr y ,:an be a kind of property. a debt owed by the

MARRIAGE

groom (wf1etlrer it is deferred or to be paid in advance), or any specifk service
offered by the groom. This indicates that the dowry needs io be simplified
and made obtainable in accordance with the groom's conditions and financial
state, so as to make marriage attainable due to the great benefits of marriage to
both individuals and communities.

Some Important Issues Relating to the Dowry
Jlicst: The dowry belongs tt> the woman, and the guardian does not have
th~ right tQclaim i!,-~xcept fqr what sh~ wilfingly permit~ him to t.ike,
This ls because Allah, Exalted he He, says,

'\<\nd give the wome;, {upo11 mar-rio.ge] their {bridal] gifts
graciously..."
(Qur'an: All-Nisa': 4)
Yet, the bride's father, in particul'ar, is entitled to take from her dowry,
even without her permission, provided ft d()es neither affect her 'basic
needs or 01use her 110)' harm. The Prophet (PBVH/ once said:

"You a11d yottr proper.ty belongto your.father."
Second; The initial stage of the woman's possession of her dowry begins
with the conclusion of the marriage contract, the same as in sdling.
However, her complete possession of it becomes due by the consummation of lhe maniagc (i.e. the husband•s having sexual intercourse
with her) , the husband staying privately with her, or by the death of
an)' of them,
Third: lf the husband divorces his wife before conswnmafing the marriage (Le. copulating with her) or staying privately with her, and he
has specified a dowry for her. th~11 she Is entitled to get half the dowry.
This is hecause AUah, Exalted be He, says:
'lo\nd ifyou divorce r/retn before you have toucbed fhem and yo11
h,we afready $pecifiedfor tlmn an obligation, then [g/1,e] half of
what you spedfied.,,"
(Qur'an:.Al•Baqarah:237)

So, 10 ,;ase of divorce, both tif them are entitled to .get half of the
specified dowry. !n addition, ir is permissible for any of fhem to
give up his/her eligible half wllllngly 10 th.c other while being in full
possession of ii, for Allah, Exalted be !-le. says:
"... unle$S tlrl!.y Joreg11 the riglll or the 011e ;,, wlrose l11md is the
(Qur'ao: Al-Baqaroh: 237)

marriage €0111nu:1 fo regoes it .. .''

Chaprcr 9: Dowry

further, Allah, Exalted be He, shows Lhe virtue and desirability ofs1,1d1
act saying:

". .. And to forego it .is 11earer to righteousness. A11d do not forget
gtaci.ousness be1wee1i you .. :'
(Qur':in: AJ -Baqanih: 237)
Thus, Allah, Exahed be Re, commands each of the separated couple
to maintain graciousness through giving up willi,ngly hi6/her right of
half of the dowry to fhe other. This is a Divine instruction for both
divorced couple lO forget i\ny l\arcl feelings between them md to show
tolerance toward each other due to the sacred relationship that once
united diem.

Fourth: All that is taken by the wife's fother11r brother from the husband,
such as clothes and the like, i~ regarded as pall't of the dowry.
Fifth: If the dowry glveu by the husband is represented by JU-gotten
or prohibited money. the marriage is still deemed valid. However; a
proper lawful dowi:y like that siven to ones like her is to be specifi~d
Instead of the prohjbited One.
Sixth: If the marriage conh'!ld is concluded without stating a dowry for
dut woman, the marriage is still deemed valid, :,ind this case is called
the marriage of tafwid [i,e. the marriage: in Which there 15" no dowry
specified). Tn such a case, a proper dowry W<e tluit given 10 oni.,s like
her must be estimated ~mi given to the woman, for Allah, Exalted be
H~,says:
"There is no blame 11pon ytia if)'OU divorce 1V0111e11 you have 11ot
touched nor specljiedJot them a11 0Diigat/o11. .."
(Qur'an: Al-'Baqnrah: 236)

111 addition, when lbn Mas· ud (rnay Allah be pleased with him) wa~
asked abo11t the ruling on a man who married a woman md did not
specify a dowry fof her and ,he did not copulate with her until his
death, he said:
''She is entitled to get a proper dowry like that give11 to ones like her,
neither more nor less. Moreaver, her duty is to observe her waiting
period ar,d her right is u, get her prescribed share in inheritance."
Ma"qil lbn Sinan said to him, 'The Jv1e$Sengerof Allah (PBTJH) gave
the same judgment in the case ofBinvtJ,• Bini' Wtlshiq.''""
(Relate,;! by At-Tirmidhi nnd other compilers of i:I11dith, and At·
Tirmidhl deemed it a ~ahl!l (authentic) /lndlf:h)

400

Vl MARRIAGE
With regard to tbe dowry, tafwld mayal6o refer to the amount of dowry
specified byeitherthe bride's guardian or the groom, or even by a third
party. ill such a case, tbe marriage contract is deemed valid, and if
there is a di~agreement concerning the amount of dowry, the woman
·i.s to be given a dowry like that given to ones like her, estimated by the
judge (arbitrator or the one in authoricy). The judge is to estimate,md
specify for her a dowry similar to that given to her relatives who have
similar qyalitiesto hers., sucn as her mother, qr her maternal or paternal
aunt. That is to say, the judg~ is to consider those who are similar lo
Lbe woman among her relatives, with regard to wealth, beauty, reason,
manners, age, und virginity or being previously marr1ed, etc, If tbe
woman doe.~ not have any relatives, she is to be given a dowry like that
glven to ones like her in her town,
In this connection, if the husband divorces his wife before consummating the marriage (Le. copulating w1thj1er), she iS entitled to recelve
a specfal compensation whose value is dependent on the husband's
financial state. Allnh, Exalted be He, says:
"There is no bla111e lf/)011 you ifyou divorce wo111e11 you have 11ot
loucl,ed !!Or specified for tliem all ob/lgatio11. But give #,em (a
gift of] µ,1ttpensation - il1e weallhy pccording to his capability
and tl,e poor accordillg to lriJ capability - a provulon accordh1g
to what is pcuptllb/e, ii duty upon the doers ojgood:'
(Qur'an; AJ'-Baqarah: 236)
The Divine colllmand hl the aforementioned verse indicates fhe
obligation of giving the divorced woman compensation in such a
case, and shows that fulfilling such an ol'>ligation is among tlle good,
1igbteousdeeds.
Back to the issue of unspecified dowries, if the separation occurs due
to the death .of any ()f the two spouses before lhe consummation of
the marriage, a dowry like tbat given 10 ones like the wife is to be
st~ted and inherited by the other spouse n.e. the one who is olive).
This is because the non -specification o[ the dowry does not affect the
validity ofmarriage; this opinion ls supported by the abovo-111e11tloned
jodgment delivered by Thn Ma,f ud.
dn theolher hand,ifthe man·iage is consummated or the spouses have
stayed pt,ivately together, lbe wife isenfitled to .receive a dowry like
that given to ones like her. This i& supported by the opinion oflmam

Chapttr 9: Dowry

401

Ahmad as wdl as other j11dgrnents issued by the Rightly -guided
Caliphs, in which they Judged that if the door (of a room where the
manied couple are) is closed or a screen is lowered (i.e. marriage is
deemed consummated), then the dowry must be paid'.
If the separation jg the wife's choice, and it occurs before the consummation of the marriage, ~he doe.s not'have the right to claim anything of
the dowry. This is just like d1e case when the wife reneges on Jsfam or
rescinds the marriage ,contracJ due to a ,certain defect in the h~1sba11d;
she does not have the right to daim her dowry in such cases.

Seventh: Before the consirtnmation of the m~rriage; the wife has the
.rig.ht to abstain from having sexual intercourse with her husb~nd until
she gets her due dowry. This is because if she gives herself sexuaJJy to
her hw;band willingly and th.en she wants to hold herself back again
until sbe gets hel" dowry, she will not be able to get it On the other
hand, lf the dowry has already been agreed to be d'eferred, she does
not have the right lo abstain from having sexual intercourse with her
ltusband, a~ she has consented to receive hef dowry later from the very
begl1lning. likewise, tl\e wife is not entitled to {lbstllin from having
sexual intercourse with her husband until she gets ber dowry, Jf she
has already had sexu~I intercourse with him.

Wedding F«;!ast (Walimah)

The wedding feast is a large mt:al for many people held on the occasion
of marriage.

The Ruling on Wedding Feasts
Holding a wedding banquet is an act of the Sunnah {Prophetic Tradition)
according to the unanimous agreeiment of Muslim scholars. Some scholars
maintain that it is obligatory due to ·the command of the Prophet {PBUH) and
that one is obliged to attend it when invited. To illustrate, the Prophet {PBUH)
said to 'Abdur-Rahman Ibn •Awf (1may Allah be pleased with him) when the
latter informed the Prophet of his marriage, "Hold a wedding feast even if
by (offering) one sheep."' (Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) Moreover, the
Prophet {PBUH) himself offered a wedding feast when he married his wives
Zaynab,' S,afiyyah,' and Mayrotlnah Bintul-liarith.

VI MARRIAGE

404

'fhe•tiJne for offeririg a,wedding feast extends from the time of concluding
the mauiage contract until the end of the wedding days. it can be held within
this period. As for the amount of food offered in a wedding feast, some /nqflis
view that it is not to be Jess: than one sheep and that the mote the better. They
base their opinion on the;tbove-meotionedl!adlt1r in which the Prophet (PBUH)
llllid to· Abdur-Ral.1man Ibm 'Awf, "Hold a wedding/east even ifby (offering) one
sl1eep.• This is to be done when one is able to afford it; otherwise, the weddiog
feast is to be hdd according to on.e'.s, financial ,capability. For example, the
Prophet (PBUH) held a wedding feast ofl!ays (a cooked food coosistirr.gofflour,
cooking fat. and cheese) wli,cn he (PBUH) married.S.afiyyah. Thisindi~ates that
a wedd'i11g feast is sufficient: to be held without slaughte.ring a sheep.
E.<travagance in offeri11 g wedding feosts is llnpermissible. However; people
nowadays offer fots ofsheep,. camels, and different kinds of foods, Olit oflavilihness
and excessiveness. Such extravagance causes a h-uge amount of food ro be left
uneaten and thrown "into r1ubbisb bins, and thus money is jusi wasted in vain,
wbioh is forbidden by our Sharl' ah (Islamic- Law) atid rejected by reason. Those
who hold snch lavish weddcn.g feasts as well as those satisfied with them are U~ble
to divine punishn1ent and deprivation ofble.ssing. Besides, such IUJCllrious wedding
feasts may contaln illegal kinds of amusements and 111eetings that usually lead
to sinfulness. They may a!S<> be held in hotels where women may not pay much
atl!!ntion Lo the1r decency .and modesty and mingle freely. and shamelessly with
men, which may lead lo disastrous consequences. Frutbermore, such wedding
banquets nowadays: may involve corruptive songs and music, as well as dlssolute
singers and photographers. In addition, lots of money is being spent and wasted
on such celebrations melessly and, ratl\er, corruptively. leading to nothing but
dissolution. Therefore,. thoS(1 who held such corrnpr banquers must fear Allah and
beware of His pimishm~nt. Allah, Exalted be He, says:

There are so many knowti ver$eS with regard to Lhis issue.
lt is obligatory for whoever is invited to a weddillg feast to attend, provided
1t meets the following conditions:
1) Tbe wedding feast one is iJ1viced to must be the first one held o·n the
occasion of that marriage. If it is repeated on the occasion of the same
marriage, one is not obligated to attend more .th,rn the firs! one, The
Prophe.t (PBUH) said:

"Holding a wedding feast 011 the firs, day (~f !/re wedding) is a duty,
011 the second day is a good practice, l!ut ot1 the third day is a sign of

l'typoctisy and ostenttllio11.""

Sheikli'Taqlyyud-Din said:

"It is pro/1/bited to offerfood and slaughter animals extravagantly (as a

2) The host must be a Muslim.

3) The host must not be one of .those manifes!ly and shamelessly
disobedient to Allah, for soch people must be avoided und deserted.
4) The invitee mU51 be personally lnvlted, i.e. it is not to be ju~t an open

5) The wedding feast one is lnvltcd to must be void of anything unl'awfuJ,

Husband-Wife Relationship

The husband-wife relationship refers to the relationship between the
married partners, which should be based on kindness and intimacy. Each of
the two spouses must live kiodly and faithfuUy with the other; none of them
should withhold the other's rights, have an aversion to fulfilling any of them,
or give the other his/her rights but follow it with injury or reminders of favor
and generosity. Allah, Exalted be He. commands husbands to be kind to their
wives; Allah says:

... And live with tJ,em in kindness ..."

(Qur'iin: An-Nisa': 19)

Allah, Exalted be He, also says:
"... A11d due to them (i.e. the wives] is similt1r to w/11,t is expected
of them, according to wl,at is reaso11able..."
(Qu.r'.\n: AJ-Baqarah: 228)

Moreover. the PrQPhet(PBUH) 6"id:
"The best amongst you is the one who treat$ his family best."'

He (PBUH) also said:

"lf 1 wero to command anyo11e lo prostrate to another, I wou7il
,omtnand a woman l'o prostmte huselj' before her husband due to
the greatness ofhis riHht qver /,er.n'

Furthermore, the Prophet (PBUlf} said:
"!fa wonum spends the night deserting lier husband~ bed. 1/ie
1mge/s keep•.sending tlteir curses on her until morning."'

Iris an act of the Sunna/1 (Prophetic Tradition) that each o(the two spouses·
should treat the other dem,mtly. show good manners towards the other, and be
toleraot concerning the bami caused bx the other. Allah, Rxali-ed be He, says:
••...a,1d to parents do good, a11d to.. , tl1e co111p1111lon at your side ..."

(Qur'an: An-Nisa':36)
It is viewed that the word "companion'' in the aforemeotii;ined verse refers
to each of the two spouses. SiJniiatly, the Prophet (PBUH) said:
"TI:eat women kindly, as they are ,(like) captives in your ht1uses."

In this connection. the husband should keep the bond of martiage even if
he dislikes his wife. This i& bec~use Allah. Exalted be He, says:
"...And live with ,them in k indness. For if you dislike lhemperhaps you disW~e a thing and Allah makes therein much

It is also related as a iahib (authentic) b.adtt/1that the Prophet (.!'BtJH) said:
'¼ believing man s1101µd not /late a believing woman (I.e. his wife);
ifhe disUkes one of he,r qualities, he will be pleased wif/1 another.»'
lr is prohibited for any c,f the two spouses to withhold any of the other's due
rights, or to have an avttrsion to fulfilling it.

Cfiapccr 11: Husband-Wife Rclarionship

409.

If tl\e marriage·contract is condoded, rhe w1fe, who is marure,enough for
the consummation of mar.riage, is ,t o be given to her husband in his house. ifhe
so desires, unless she has made a condition Jn the marriage contract that 5he
will xemaia ln her house or in her town.
l t is permissible for the husband to take his Wife along with him when
he travels as long as 6uch a journe,y in volves neither disobedience to Aliah
nor any danger. This is based on the fact that the Prophet (PBUH) and bis
Comi>an ions used to take their wiives along,with them when they traveled.
However, most of today journeys are made to disbelieving ,ountdes,
which patronize corruption, licerntiousness, and dissoluteness. Hence, ii is
imperrrussible to travel to such conntries just for tourism and having fun,
for such journeys greatly tbreateti one's religion as well as one's manners'.
Moreover, the woman herself and her guardians should refuse her tr.aveling
with her husband to ,;;uch countri.es.
Ther~ is a common practice. innovated by the wealthy newlyweds; they
travel on the second morning of the wedding to such disbeliev'ing coun1cies in
order to spend their so-called honeirmoon. in fact, it is more appropriate to call
it the evil month, as it involves committing prohibited deeds, such as taking off
the Islamic veil. putting on clothes •similar to tho,;;e of tbe disbelievers' as well
as witnessing their bad traditions and deeds, and visiting places of irurnor:illey.
As a res11l1, the Musttm women m~y return t o thdr homes affected by sucrr
evll trodltiom desirlng to imitate them and renounce !hose of the Islamic
community. Hence; such journeys ;ue by all means p!'Ohibited, and those who
make them should be reproved and prevented froin doing so. Moreover, the
woman's guardians are to prevent her from travcli11g with her h\lsband to such
countries and rid her of such a hee,dless husband, as she is considered a trust
that the guardlai1s should preserve. Even if the woman herself agrees to travel
"~th her husband to such ·countde·s, she may be unaw;ire of her interest an.d
mindless of the consequences of such travels. That is why there .u:e persons to
control and observe hetr interests, namely her guardians, and preventing her
from such acts is one of their dutie;!.
As for sexual intercourse, the husband is prohibited fo copulate with his
wife in,h,r menses, for Afiah. Ex~lted be He, ~.iys;

~d tl,ey fl$1c you about 1111enstruation_ Say, 'It is hann, so kup

(Qur'An: Al•Baqarah;. 222)
In addition, ii is !)errn,lssible for the l1t1sband to force his wife to wash
herself to remove tlirl, to shave undesirable hair in her body, and to clip long
dirty nails. He can also pr,~venl her from eating whatever causes a bad smell
io the moulh, as suc:h ma,tters caase the husband's ave,·sion. Moreover:; it is
permissible for the hw;ban,d to force his wife to 'lake <! ritual bath to remove
her state of major ritual iunpw;ity, and lo observe the Five Pcayers. 1f lhe
wife refuses to observe thEm, he is to oblige and discipline he1·. After that, if
she insists on her refusal of observing prayer, it becomes prnhibi1ed for the
husband to contlnue living; with her. Thus:, the husbaad sboalci force his wife
to give up and avoid whatever i~ prnhibiied, for Allah, Exalted be He, says:

'!Men are in·cltarge of womcr1 by fright of} what fqualities) Allah
has giver, one over tl,e other. ..•
(Ql!r'an: An-Nisal: 34)
Allah, Exalted be He, allso says:

Prophet tPBUH) said, "Treot i.1ome11 kindlji.''

Ch•pttr 11: 1-iu,band-Wlft Relationship

4 1I

The husband is required to spend one of every four nights with his wife,
provided she is a free woman, if she ·asks him to do so, This is because he
cannot marry but three other women besides her, and has to spend a night
with each in this case. This is b:Jsed on the fact that Ka · b lbn Siwar passed
-such a judgment during the Caliphate of· Umar lbnuJ-Kha!!iib (may Allah
be pieased with b.uu) and it was such a well-known judgment that it was met
with approval and none contradkted it. It is also the opinion adopted by .~ome
fnqihs, and what i& mentioned above shows its proof and the principle on
which it is based. Howeve,:; Sbeiikh Taqi)'}'1ld-Dio hai; a different view in this
Tegard; he says that the case of b,:ing 1)1artied to one woman differs from that
of being married to four concerning the ruling on the number of nights speot
with one's wife/wives. And, Allah knows best.
lt is obligatory for the potent husband to have s,:xual intercourse with hi$
-wife, if she ask,; h;m to do, at least once every four months. This is becau5e
Allah, Exalted be He, decreed lhat the maximum period for a husband
who swears not to have sexual i.ntercol!rse with his wife is four months; so
scholars apply this ruling on other cases of men. Yet, Shaykhul-Islam Tbn
Taymlyah views that having sexual intercourse with one's wife is obligatory
according to the wife's satisfaction, and that it is not restricted to a certain
period, as 1ong as it does not cause harm to the husband or keep him from
seekiqg provision.
'Jh this connection, if the h1usband bas been abroad for more than 5ix

months and hi~ wife asks him to come back, the husband is obligated to do
so, unless he is performing an obligatory fiojj (pilgrimage), or participating in
jihad ~fighting 1n the Cau&e of Allah), ot exctlsably unable to come back. But
if he refoses ro come back with,~ut having aoy exc1.1se preve__nting him front
coming back. and so she asks for ,separation, the judge (or the one in authority)
is to separate them after informi ng the husband. Thi~ is because the husband
has neglected one of 1he wife's rinbts. which ca1JSes ber harm.
Sheikh Taqiyyud-Dln said:

'"The harm caused to the wife by the lmsbaHd h1het1 Ju, Joes not
have sexual intercourse wjf/J her necessitates the invalidation
of the marriage contract. T'hL< is 'lo be applied whatever the
case may be, whether it is Intended by tire husband o,· not, and
whether he is potent or not, just like the ruli11g on maintenance,
but rather worthier."•

VI MARRIAGE

It is prohibited for eacfi of the two &pouses to rell others about their
private matters related to their sexual interco11rse; This is because the Prophet
(P BUH) said:

"Verily, among the most wir.ki!d of people in the Sight ofAllah on
the Oay of Resurrection is the matr who has.sexual relations with
/tis wife ,md the1r he divulges her (,exua/) secrets."'
(Related by Imam Muslim)
This badith is regarded as a proofof the prohibition of divulging the secrets
of their sexual relations, whethet' they are-words or actions.
It is for the husband to prevent his wife frotn,going out of the house unnecessarily. He should not let her go wherever she likes without his pennission. Moreover, it is p,:oh ibited for rhe wife to go out of the hou.ie without
the permfssion of her husband, unless uccesSll,ry. On the other hand, 1t Is
desirable for the husbaJ\d to grant his wife permission to go out to nurse
her legally urunarriageable relatives, such as her brother or unde, for this
involves maintai1,ing the ties of kinship. fw·thermore, the husband 1s. not
entitled to prevent hls wife's parents from visiting het> at horn,:. unless he
fears that they may turn her against him whenever they come to visit her. rn
µils case, it is for the husband to preyent them from visiting her.

The 'husband is also entitled to prevent his wife from being hjred or
employed, as he is suppo~ed to provide for.her and to meet all her needs. Tp.is Is
also because being hired or employed makes the wife too busy to fully c,bserve
her husband'.~ rights or to look after her children. Work may-also expose tp.e
wife to immoral situations, especially noWndays, when decency and ll')Orality
have becom~ rare where.u. dissoluteness and lmmorallty lire widespread. In
other words, women nowadays mingle With men in office.~ and workplaces
involving prohibited privacy, which ls a great moral danger that undoubtedly
must b~avoided.
Furthermore, it is for the husband lo prevent his wifo frorn breastfeeding
her baby &om a former husband unkss necessary, in addition, the wife is not ro
obey her parents when i:hey ask her to separate from her husband, nor should
she obey•them wlien they askher to vlsii them if her husband disagrees. Thi& is
because her obediwce to her husband Is worthier than that to her parents. To
illustrate, it is namited that the paternal aunt of 'Hll!!ayo came I() the Prophet
{PBUlf) and he asked her:

Chop«r 11: Husbond-Wilc Rdononship

413

''Do you lmvr n husbn11d," When sNe l'eplied in lhe 11.ffirmatiw, he
(PBUH) mid to her, "See your stalu~ 111/1/, him (i.e. wf,elheryou lry

to $!-lti$fy him or11ot)ifor he is yo11r pamilise 11111{ yourfire (i.e. your
en:tering eilhet Paradise or Hell-fire can be dependent 011 the wuy
you rreat /iim)."'
lf thehu~band has mo.re than one wife, it is obligatory for him to treat them
as equals and to divide the time he spends wlth them justly. Allah, Exalted be
He, S.l)T.

•~ .. Ami livt with tliem in kl,1dness...u ( Qu1·'an: An-Nisa': 19)
Allah, Exalted be He, also says:

''. ..So do not indi11e complerely /toward one] and leave 41101.her
lia11ging.. ."
(Qur'an: Au-Nisii': 129)
This means that when the husband favors one of his wives over the other,
it makes the other ns if suspended or ''hanging": for she has a husband a.n d
does nol have him at the same time. In this regard, the equal trcatmenr the
husband gives each is mainly based on his just division ofihe nights he spends
with them. This is because the night is t11e time wheo a man goes back home,
finds tranquility with his family, and generally goes to bed with his wife. As
forthose who mainly work at night, such as security guards and the like, they
are to divide daytimes among their wives, as daytime for them Is regarded as
night for others.
Moreover, even if one of one'~ wives is in her puerperium or menstrual
period or she is sick, she ls stiU entitled to have her equal share of one's ti1.11,;.
This is because the husband's presence with his wlfe creates intimacy and
~ffection between them, even if without having sexual intercourse.
In addition, it is not for the husband to set the order of his wives in his
schedule according 10 his own desire. Rather, ii is lo be done b)• mean:s of
drawing lots or by the consent of all his wives. t his is because placing n cer)oin
wife firnt in .the husband's schedule means that he favors her ov~r the other~.
while It is obligatory for him to treat them all as ~quals.
On the other hand, the husband is not enLit.led lo take one of his wives
along with him on a journey and leave the others, unless he draws lots among
them or all his wives give their consent This is based on the foct that when\'ver
the Prophet (PBUH) Intended to go on a journey, he drew lots among his
wives and took with him the one upon whom th~ l.ot full ' .

Matters Nullifying Wife's Right of
Expenses and Share of Nights

If the wife travels without the permission of her husband, or with his
permission but to fulfill someth ing for herself, her right of expenses and
her share of her hllSband's time (in case she is not his only wife) drop. This
is because when the wife travels without her husband's permission, she is
regarded as a disobedient, recalcitrant wife. On the other hand, if she travels
with the permission of her husband but j 11st to observe her own interest, it
becomes unattaioabl.e for him to enjoy her due lo ber personal reason. Tbe
same rul.ing applies when the husband wishes to take his wife along with
him on a journey and she refuses; she does not have any right of expenses or
share of her husbands allotment of nights in this case, as she is cons.idcred a
disobedient wife. Likewise, if the wife refuses to go to bed with her husband,
her right of expenses and her share of nights are nullified, as she becomes as
disobedient as a recalcitrant wife.

MARRIIIGE

Itis prohibited for the husbaqd to have sexutl intercourse with one of his
wives on a night or a day whkh is not hers unless necessary.
On the other hand, it is perm lssible for one of the husband's wives to give
u,p her share of the nights al:lorted ,by the husband, after taking his permission,
to her fellow wife. This is because the nights allotted are among tbe ·\vives'
,r ights, ip addition to the fact that both wives agree to such a deal. To illustrate,
Sawdah (one of the Proph,et's wives, may Allah be pleased with her) gave
her night to her fellow wife " A'.isJlJ\h (tn~y Allah be pleased with her) so that
the Prophet (PBUH) used fo spend with •A'ishah both her night and that of
1
Sawdah , However, if the wife who has given her share of nights to another
claims her share back, the husband is to comply with her request.
Moreover, it i~ permissible for l'he wife 10 give up her right of expenses
and share of nighrs for the11•urpose of makjngthe husband keep her as a Wife.
ARah , Exalted be l:fo, says;

''.A11d ifa womanfe,~rs from her husband comen,pt or evasion,
there is no sin upcm them if tl,ey make terms of settlement
between t1teitt - a1f d settlement is best...••
(Quran: An• Nisa': 128)
With regard to· the aforementioued verse, •A'ishah said:

"It ,oncems the woma•ri whose husband-tloes not want Jo keep her
with /rim any longer; .but he ,vants to divorce her. So, she says to
him, 'Keep me and do not ,:fivorc~ me, and f ghte up my ri/;hr of
expenses and my slial'e of nights.' •·

In addition, when Sawda,Ji grew Old and feared that the Messenger of Allah

(PBUH) may leave ber, she Haid:
'1 gtve my night (I.e. the 11ight tire Prophet spends will, her} 1<1 'A'ishah.~'
It is i mportant to point out that if one marries .~ virgin while havmg other
wives, one should spend lh.e first seven nights wilh her and then by 1urn.s,
w1thour deducting those seven nights from her share afrerwacds. However,
if.such a man manles a woman who has been previously married (i.e, not
a virgin), he should , pend t:he first three nights with bet and then by turns,
withm!! ·deducting those three nights from her share aften~ar<hi .. This is
because Al-Bukhari and Muslim related:

't\bti Qililb11h n11rrmed 011 tlie authority of A11as (may Allah be
pleased with him), 'Ir it an act of the S~m11~h (Prophetic Tradition)

been previoosly marned (i.e .. 11(51 ii virgin), then he should spend
the first seven nights with her (i.e. the virgin) and tllen by lllrns.
And ifa man marries a woman who hru been previously married,
then he should spend the first three nights- with her. and' then by
turns;'Abu.Qililbah commented, 'ifI wishe4, l wou[dhave .said Jhat
A11as ascribed this bfldith to the-Prophet (PBOH)! "'

(Related by AI-Tlukhilri and Muslim)
Still, if the mans bride who has been previously married (i,e. ·not a virgin)
asks hlm to ~pend wiih her the first seven nights instead of three, he shoulcl
comply. Yet, he has 10 spend the same nwnber of nights with his othe~ wive~.
After that, he ls to apportion 11ight& among them all, one night for each by turns.
This is because when the Prophet (PBUHI married Umm Salamah who bad
been previously married, I.e. she \\'<lS not virgin then, he (PBUH) said to hei::

"There is 110 lack of estimation for you 011 the part ofyour husband
(~e. himstlf). So, ifyou wish. I can stay with yo11Jor seven nights,
but m cose 14o, J sha/l lwve .also to spend seven nights )'lith each of
my wives afterwards."'
(Related by Ahm~d. Muslim, and other compil= of ]iadtt/1)
One of the releva1tt issues irr !his connection is the wife's disobedienGe,
recalcitrance, arrogance, or violation of her marttaiduties towards bet husband.
In this respect. it is prohibited for the wife to disobey her husband unjustifiably.
For example. a husband may notice Iha! his w!Je show!r disapproval of having
sexual intercoune with him or slackens when he asks her to. In this case, the
husband is to admonish her and remind her of Allah's punlshmenr, of his
rights over her as a husband, and of the sin of not fulfilling her marital duties
towards him. If she persists in disobe.ying him despite his admonishment, he
should sexually forsake her in bed and stop spealcing 10 her fur three days.
After that, if she still disobeys him, he should discipline her by beating her but
not violently, i.e. in a way thot does not cause her injury. 'This is because Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
": ..Sut those [wives} from whnm you feat arrogance - I.first) advise
tliem; /then If they persist), fonake them in bed; a11d (finally),
,strike thL'flf ..
(Qur'¼n: kn-Ntsa'~3'4)

.»

In this connection, if each of the two spouses claims the injustice of the
uther and there is no way to reconcile them, the Judge (or the one in authority}
should seek the intervention of two equitable arbitrators of their families 1<1

Wife's Releas;e against Payment
(Khul')

A wife's release against payment is the wife's separation from her husband
in return for remuneration paid to the husband, and it is effected through a
certain spoken form. Linguistically, the Arabic word "khul"' means taking off
something, and this term implie.s that the wife in this case separates from her
husband just like taking off her clothing, since the husband and his wife are
referred to in the Qur'an as clothing for one another due to their closeness,
union, and intimacy. AJ!ah, Exalted be He, says:

•~ .. They are clothing for you and you are clothingfor them ..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 187)
It is well known that marriage is a union between the husband and his
wife to live together in kindness, build up a new family, and bring up a new
generation. Allah, Exalted be He, says:

VII, DIVOI\CE

':4nd ofHissigns is ll111t He createdfor yo11from yourselyes mates
that you 1tiay fi11d rn11n1Juility /11 lhe,n; a11d He placed between
you affection 011d mercy..."
(Qor'an: Ar-Rum: 2})
If this noble objective of mtarringe fs not fulfilled., as when there is no mutual
affection between the spouse:s, or when there is no affection of the husband
towards bis wife, or when th,eir- living together becomes 11r1bearable and it is
too difficult t.o settle theif disputes, the busb~od in such cases is obUged to
fl!)ease-her kindly. Allah, Exailted be He, .a)~

"...fhe11 [after tllat], ,either keep [1,er] in .all acceptable 1111mner
or release [/,er] JVith irood treat111e11t...w
(Qur';in: 1\1-Baqarah: 229)
Allah also says:
~:s,tt Iftlley separate~,,,, d;;,urce/, Allah wili'e11rid1each /ofthem J
fromRis abundance. ,A11d ever is Alla/, E1fcompllS$/ng and Wise;"

(Qur'ao:An-Nisa'; 130)
However, when the husband loves his \Yife but she dislikes him, his manners,
his appearance. or his ia& of' religiousness, or fears the sin of not observing
his rights, ii is permissible foir her to a.1k for separation by ransoming berself
lfu:ongh paying him a mone~u-y compemation. Allah, Exalted be He., says:
"... but ifyou fear rlu,t they will not keep [JVUhtnl the limits of
Allah, then tltere i5 11a blame upon either ofthem concerning that
by wl,lch 5/,e ransom5 h,wself. .."
(Qur'an: Al-Baq.u-ah: 229)

This verse m,:ans th&:t when any,ofthe two spouses feels that living together
results in disputes and violatic,ns of one ~nothe(s rights, or when the wife fears
that she may disobey her hu!;band, it is permissible for the wife in this case
lo t.ike the initiative and ask for her release against paymenL Likewise, it js
permissible for the husband M accept such remuneration in such cases and to
release her.
The wisdom behind ordit t~nce of .i wife'.s release against payment (khul 1)
is to enable the wife to iJ'tevo,cably separate from her husband. as it is a just
settlement for rhe husband and the wife In cnseslike the aforementiooed ones.
lt is an act of the Swvra/i (Pro1phetic Tradition) for the husband to,agree to his
wife's reguest of relerue. Howc~ver, if the husband loves his wife, it is desirable
for the wife to be patient and pol Lo ask for 6eparation.

Chapn:r 'J : Wife's RdL-ase apinst l'ayo:ient '(K/111/)

4.2.3

The wife's release ag;iinst payment ls permissible when its reason is fulf\lled
as stated in the aforementioned Qur'anic ver-Se, namely the fear that the two
spouses will not keep a good relation within.the limits of Allah. However. when
there is no need for ;;u¢1 separation, it becomes detestable in this case, or even
prohibited according to others. This is hecause the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"{f any woman asks her h1.o1Sbat1d fot divorce without some sfTCJng
1
reason, the odor ofPamd/$•? wiU be f(lrbidden lo l1e1:"
(Related by the Five Compilers of Hadfl/1 except An-Nasa1)
In this regard, Sheikh Taqiyyud-Dln &aid:
"When a wife dislikes her f.,usband, the Sunnah permils he,, to ask
jor re1ell$e in r~tllrn fer rerri1memlio11 and ranso1n luwelffrom her
1
husband, just as t/,e captive ransoms /1/mself.'

Sometimes, the husband does not like his wifo but keeps her so thar she
may become bored wirh living Widl him and may ask him for release for
mone1ary compensation. In this case, the husband is considered urtjust to h1s
wife and it is prohibited for him to take sue/I compensation, and the release
against payme11t (kht.1/ ·) become:, invalid. Altah, Exalted be He, says:
"..-A11d do llOI make diffiicultiesjor them 111 order to take {back]
part of what you gave t/11~ ..."'
(Qur'an: An-Nii.a': 19)

The meaning of this Qur'anic; verse is that the husb11nd must not ttear his
wife badly to make her give him 'bacl,aU or part of what he has paid as dowry
ot give up some of her rights. StiU, the verse makes an exception as it permits
the husband to make difficulties for his v.~fe to get bac;lc the dowry h~ has given
her if she is an adulteress; Allah, Exalted be He, s~ys:

Release against payment (kln// ') is permissible according to ihe Quriin,
the Sw111ah (Prophetic Tr11dition) and the conserulu& of scholars, provided
fhere exists a good reason for it. The Qur'anic evidence of the permissibility of
release against payment is the aforementioned verse., in which Allah, Exalted
be l:le, says:

•~.. but if yoo fe11r !h,al they will not keep [within] the limits of
Allah, then t/rere is 110 blame upon either ofthem concerning that
by-wluch slte ransomi, l1erself. . .''
(Qui'an, Al-Baqarah: 229)

As for .the Sunna/r, the lfoilowing l:1.adit/1, which is related in the ;ia/:1.il!
(Authentic Book) of Al-Bukhari, is a pmof of the permissibility of a wife's
release in return for remuneration,
"The wife of Thtlbil Ibli Qqys came to the Prophet (PBUH) and
said, 'O Messenger of Allah/ I dCI ,.,ot blame T/ltibit for defects In
/1i~ character ot Iris religio11, but I, being a i\1uslim, dislike behaving
1n an un-Islamic mam11cr (if 1· remain with him).' Upon that; the
Messenger of Allah (PBVH) said (to her), 'Will you give back the
garden which he. (T/uib11t, the l111s/1and) ha.1 given you (as dowry)?'
She said, 'Yes.' Theret1p,m, tl1e Messenger ofAllah (PBUH) ~tzid to
him (Thtib/1), 'Accept tli e. garden, a11d divorce her once.' "'
As regards the conse.nsus of Muslim scbolars, lbn 'Abdul-Ba!')' said:

"Al-M11zani is the only scholar who disagrees in tl,is regard (i.e.
disagret:S on the permissibility of release. against payment). He argues
that the verse (i.e. rhe aforeme11tioned one; Al-Baqarah: 229) i.
abrogated by the following- verse /11 which Allah, Exalted lie He, says,
'But if you want to rep•lace one wife w/tli nnotlter-a/Id -you ,have·
given one of t1,em II g,-eat amount {in gifts], do 11ai take, {back}
from ita11ythliig.. .' (Qur'an: An-Nisf, 20f'

There are some conditions for the validity of
release-against paymen,t (kl,ul' ):
• The monetary-compens~tion must be paid in :return by .someo1\e who is
legally quallfied to dc1nate.
• The husband must be :legally qualified to divorce.
• Jf tbere is 110 legal reason, the :husband must not mal<e diHkullies for
his wife to ge1 1,,ack the dowry he has given her.
• The release against p:arment (kliul ' ) must be done through its legal
,spoken form.

42.5

lfit is done througb a spo~en form of divorce or an implicit form, provided
the husband has the intention of divorce, ·I.hen it il> regarded as divorce. In this
case, the ruling on release in ret\irn for payment (kJwl '') is applied so that the
hw;ban<l is not entitled to take l1is wife bnck, but he can remarry ber with a
new marriage contract, even without she marries ancl separates from another
husband first, provided it \ the i:elease in return for payment) has nm \1een
preceded by two divorces that make it a threefold irrevocable divorce.
However, if the separation is done lh.rough the leg.ll spoi<en form of a
tele,ise in return for payment (k:hul ' ) or its equivalent forms which indicate
the cancellation of marriage or the like, provided the husband -does not intend
it to be a divorce, it is consider,:<!.~ mere canc.:e!lation of the marriage conrract
whkh does not affect the nltmb1!r of divorces. This ls the opinion reported to
have bee11 adopted by Ibn ' Abba~; (may Allah he ple..sed with him). Ibo ' Abbas
b>lSe~ his opinion on the. fotlowi.ng·sequence of verses: Allah, Exalted be He.,
says, "Divorce is twice,.." (Q1.1fa.n: Al-Baqarah: 229), and then soys, "... then

l.bn •Abb~s argued that Allah DOentions two acts of divorce, then an act .o f
the release against payment (kh:ul '), then nn act of divorce. If the release in
return for payment ,\ffected the ·number of divorces, there would be four.acts
of divorce, not tluee, which is in-valid. And, Allah knows best.

Divorce
Divorce is the dissolution of the bood of marriage or part of it. The ruling
on divorce varies according to the different situations. It can be permissible,
detestable, desirable, obligatory, or prohibited. So, it can involve any of the
main five rulings.
Divorce is permissible when the husband needs it because of his wife's ill
conduct, the harm caused to him by keeping his wife, and the non-fulfillment
of the legal objective of marriage by keeping her.
However, divorce is detestable if there is no need for it, as when there is
no problem between the married couple; some scholars deem it prohibited in
such a case. According to the preponderant view, divorce is permissible with
detestability in this case, for the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"The most detestable lawful act in the Sight ofAllah is divorce.'''
(Related by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah, and the men of its chain of
transmitters are trustworthy)

VJT: DIVORCE

428

In this hadith, tlJe Prophet (PBUH) refers to dlvorte as laWful though it is
detestable in l:he Sight of Allah, indiCllling its de!est;ibility-based permisslbility
in this case. The reason for ilts detestability in this case is that it puts an end to
a marriage that fulfills the fogally desired interests.
On the other hand, divorce becomes desirable if the wife suffers harm
during her marital life, such as when there is dissension betwee1i he, and her·
husband or when she dis1ikes him. In this case, maliltainirtg the marriage
muses more haflTl to d1e v;ife, while the Prophet {PBUH) ~ :

·•one slrould not harm others nor sho11/d mu seek benefitfor oHeself
by t.ausing harm to oti\ers:·
Divorce becomes obligatory for the husband ifthe wife is neither tighteous
nor updght on the religi01.m level. For elt!lmple. the wife may be so negligent
in prayer lhat she abando~ts ii or· pe1tform~ it belatedly, while the husband
is llOable to rectify her, or she may be morally .dishonest In such cases, it
is obl(gatory for the husband to divorce her according to the preponderant
vlew in this reg~r<l Ibn Ta:rmlyah (may Allah ha-.e mercy on him) s;iid, ''If
the wife commits 1uf11ltery, II' is not for !lie husband to keep lier: Otherwise, he Is
considered a cuckold."' Simil;u-ly, tflhehusband is neither righteolls nor upright
concerning religion, it is oblligatory for the wife to ask for divorce, or separate
from him by- cele"ase against remuneration ~klrul '). It is not for the wife to stay
with him as long a$ he is ne1;ligentofhis religious duties.

lf the husband has swotn not to have sexual inter1;oursq wllh his wife and
ihen the waiting period of four months passes and he still refuses to do 50 and
expiate for his oath, it ls,otiligatory for him to divorce her, and he must be
forced to do so. 'T'his -is bec.1·u5e Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"For those who swear notto ha,,e sexual relations with tlaeir wives

(Qur'an: AI-Baqarah: 226-227)

and lltis is the typiail way nf lslnm in all its gyeat laws and regulations that
maintain the iJ1terests of humans tn tlie long >1I1d the short run. Therefoce, we
praise Allah, E,rolted be He,. for His bo1int)• and bestowal of lslum upon us.
The statement of divorCie 1s valid when prtmounced by a legally qualified,
free-willed, sane husband rnr by his authorized repre.~entarive, as the Prophttt
(PBVI-J) says:

"Divnrce belongs on~y to the one who takes lwld of the leg (i.e.
the Tiusba11d)."

However, a MusJim bernmes legatly unqualified to divorce if !'tis mental
faculties are lacking due to something excusable, such as being in~ne,
-uncon6cious, asleep, a sufforer from a disease that causes unawareness such as
pleurisy; being forcfd to d.Ji.nk an intoxicant, or taking anesthetic fot medical
treatment lf one in any of the aforementioned cases pronounces the spoken
form of divorce, the divorce is not leg,illy effective. 'lb illustrate, Al,Bukhart
related ln his ~ah.lh (Authentic nook ofHaditli) that ' All lbn AbC! Iilib (may
All~h be pleased with him) said:

"Bvery divon:e is petmissi/Jle e..ta;pt t/iat by ,m insane man.'"
l'h is ls because sanity is the principle upon whkh a legal judgment is
based. On the other hand, ifa person's mental faculties .1re lacking due to his
willingly takmg an intoxicarqt, schofor~ differ about the validity of his divorce
in such a case. In general, the Pour lm~s ;is well as a group of Muslim scholars
maintain tbat such >t divorc,~ ls valid.
If 4 person is forced -to divorce bis wife, and he divorces her in order to
avoid injustice, oppression, or persecution,.his divorce is not le.gally effective.
This ls because the Prophet (PBUH) says:

''Tliete is no divorce or ema11cipatio11 in case ofdttress:'•
(Related by Ahmad. Abu oawacl, and lbn Ma;-ah)
Moreover, ;\llah, Bxalte.d be He, says:
"W1,oever disbclie1•es i11 [i.e. tfe11ie.sj Allah after bis belief. ..
except for one who ,is farced [to reno,mce his religum) wlaile ./,/s

(Qur'an: An-Nahl: 106)

Though disbelief is mor·e serious than divorce, Allah pardoM those who
pretend to be disbelievers u:Ader dure:;i;. Thus, divorce, Witb gyeater reason, u;
not legally effective when the husband ls·forced to do it. However; divorce can

sexual intercourse with her and,expiate for his oath.
When a man is in a state of ariger but still aware of what he is Saying, his
divorce is valid in this case. Yet, if he is too enraged to be aware of what he is

Sunni' and Innovative Divorce

Sunni Divorce
The divorce according to the Swmah {Prophetic Tradition) is the divorce
that takes place accord'ing to the way ordained by Allah and His Messenger
(l'BUH). It is effected by the husbands single pronouncement of divorce in
an interval between the wife's menstruations in which he has not had sexual
intercourse with her, and then he leaves her until her waitiog period is over.
This divorce accords with the Sumu,h in terms of number, as he pronounces a
sin.gle divorce on his wife and leaves her until her waiting period is over. It also
accords with the Sunnah in terms of timing, as he divorces her during her state
of major ritual purity (i.e. the period between her menstruations) in which he
has not had sexual intercourse with her. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"O Prophet, when you {Muslims] dworce women, divorce them
for {the commencement off their waiting period..."
(Qur'an: At-I alaq: 1)

VTI: DIVORCE

434

Commenting on the aforementioned Qur'anic vene, lbn Mas' Od (ruay
Allah be pleased "1th him) said:

"The verse me!lns that women Ctlll .be·divorced only during their
state ofpurity when no sexual i11terco11rse has taken place."'
Moreover, ' All lbn Abu :["alib (may Allah be pleased with him) said:

"Ifpeople adhere lo t/m ordin1111ce of Allah concerning divorce, tire·
1111111 will never regret tiivorcing a woman. He pronounces a singl11c
divorce (at a time) on h,is 1vife, and then /raves her.for chree periods
3
of menstruation during wliich he can take her back ·if he likes."
This means that as long as the woman is stlll in her waiting pedod, ber
husband can take her back, as Allah grants the- man who has pronounced a
single divorce on his \\'ife a c:haoce to take her back during her waiting,per1od
if he regrets divorcing hei; provided it is not his third pronouncement of
divorce on her. However, if i't is the third divorce, the husband cannot take his
ex-wife back.

Innovative J)ivorce
Innovative divorce refers to the dlvorce that takes place in a prohibited way
such as J:he following cases:
• Divorcing one's wife by' pronouncing the spoken.form of divorce thrice
simultaneously: (Innovative divorce in terms of number)
• Divorcing one's wife ,,vhile she is in a slate of rnenstrµatioa on:onfioement: (Innovative diivorcc in terms of timing)
• Divorcing one's wife while she is in a st3te.of purity in which he has had
sexual intercourse with her; (lm1ovative divorce in terms of timing)
Innovative divorce con,:etning the number of the pronouncements of
divorce m<1kes one's ex.-w1fc prohibited for one to take back until she marries
another man and then,separntes from him. Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"And ifhe has divo,·ced lie,· {for the third time], tlunshe is f!OI
lawful to /,Im afte,word until [after] she n1arries a husba,ul
otl1er than l1i111...~
( Qurln: Al• Baqaroh: 230)
As for the innovative di~·prce concerning the timing,of divorce, when such
a divorce takes place, it is des:irable for the husband to take bis wife back. This is
l;,~c;ause when •Abdulll\h Tbn ' Umar (may Allah be pleased with them! divorced

"Ch~pcc:r 3: S,mni and Jnnovacive Dlvor~C:

-435

'.hls wife during her menses, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) ordered him (o
talce her back,' as related by the G roup of Compilers of Haditl,. Thus, if the
husband in such a case takes his wii(e back, he must keep her until sbe becomes
in a $late of major ritual purity-and then he can divorce her if he pleases.
It is prohibited for the husband to divorce his wife thro,igh the aforem~ntioned innovated ways ofd.ivc,rce, whether concerning tho: number of tf\e
pronouncements of divorce or its timing. Allah. Exalted be ffe, says:
"Divorce is twice. Thet1 {tlfiterthat], either keep {herJ i11 an acceptable ma1met of releDse [heir] with good hvatment..."

(Qur'an: Al -Baqarah, 229)
Allah also says:
"O Prophet, whe,1 yo11 f Muslims} divorce women, divorce them
for [the,commenceme11t o/1 tlieir waiting perio11, ,."
{Qur'~: A!-Iahlq: I)
Le. while they are in a state ,pf major ritual purity provided no sexual
intercourse with them has taken place. In addition, when the Prophet (PBUHJ
was informed that a maq had divo1r,ed his wife with three pronouncements ot'
divorce at a time, he (PBUHj .wondered angrily:
•is t/1e Book. ofAllah made 11\g/11 of while I am ar,mngst you?!"'

Ilesides, ' Umar Ibnul-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) used to bent
any man who divorced his wife thriice (ata time) ifhe was brought to him '. For
more illustration, when the 'Prophet (PBUH) was informed that •Abdullah Ibn
' Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) divorced his wife during her menses,
he (PBIJld) got angry and ordered him to take ber back'_
All the previo11s proofs indicate that it is obligatory for eve_ry Muslim
man to aclh~re to the Jegal rulingi, on divorce observing both its number af
pronouncements and timing. A Muslim has also to avoid th~ prohibited ways
of divotce whethercoucerning the number of the pronouncements of divoro:
or its timing. However, many men, regrettably, do not understand or care about
this nowadays, and, consequently, 'they cause themselves difficulty and regret,
,md then they seek sollitions to get theit wives back. discomfiting the muftis
whom they refer to. In fact, aii s~tch problems are consequences of making
light of the Book of Allah, Exalted be He.

VH: DIVORCE

Some men, unfortunately. use divorce \IS a weapon to thre.aten iheir wives
with, forcing~ to do something or preventing them from doing another.
Other men heedkssly use ,divorce as art onth whUe dealing with ot talking
to others. Such men must fear Allah and keep away from uttering the oaths
of divorce, for divorce is not made to be used as an oath, but to be resorted
to when necl!Ssary and acc\Jrding 10 tl1e specified number and timing of the
pronouncement of divorce"

The Spoken Forms of Divorce
There are two spoken ft;mis ,of divorce:

A- Direct pronount:ement: It Includes-the word "divorce" or any of
il.s derivatives that 1:ndicate that the husband divorces his wife, and it
carries no other tneaning than divorce, such as saying to one's wi~, ''I
divorce you." or, "Y(lu are divorced:' or, ''You have become a divorcee.•
In such cases, the divorce is deemed valid and effective. Yet. if the
husband says some thing like, ''You are being divorGed;' or, "Get your
divorce," and the li:ke, divorce in .such ca,ses Is invalid, as the spoke-il
form does not indi(:ate its effectiveness.
B- Indirect pronouncement: fl Includes metonymic words that imply
divorce as well a,s other meanings, suc11 us sayingio one's wife something
like, "You aref re~" or, "Go and keep away from me; or, "Go back to
your parents; 01; '' rhere is no liablllty on your part towards me."
'!'he legal difference ht tween direct and ,indirect sp6ken forms of divorce is
that divorce is valid once th(! husband utters any of the direct pronouncements,
even iJi jokingly or uninten!ionally. This is because the Prophet (PBUH) says;

"There are /liree /1,ings wliic/1, wliether tmdertaken seriously ori11
jes~ are treated as serious:liivor~e, marriage a11d taking batck a wife
(ajtet- revocable divon:e)."
(Rdated by the Five Compilers of Hadlth e.xcept All-Nasa'i)
However, divorce is inva.lld in case of utte.ring ?DY of the indirect metonymic
words of divorce, unless the husband does intend to divorce his wife. This is
because such indirect metonymic words indicate some meanings other than
di'v.im:e. 'fhus, if the husband d'oes nor mean tQ divorce his wife when uttering
such words, divorce i5 lnvallid and ineffective, excq,( in lhree cases:

1l If he utters the$e words when there is a controversy betwe~n him and
~.16 wife;

Ch,,p~r 3: S11•11i and Innovative 01vor"e

i37

2) If he titters these words wben he is angry;
3) If he utters these -words in reply to his wife when she asks him to
divorce her:
In the aforementioned three cases, divorce is deemed valid and effective as
soon as the husband utters such inetonymic words, even if he drums that he
has not intended divorce, for the state he i~ in shows the intentio11 of divorce.
And? Allah knows best.
[t jg permissible for the husbttnd lo desig,;iate a representative to divo'tce

his wife whether the representati\•e is a stranger or even the wife herself, as it
is pei:missible for the husband to authorize his wife to divorce herself if she
wants. The authorized representative legally acts on behalf of the husband,
and thus the ruli11gs on direct or indirect pronouncements and the nurnbeF
and the timing of divorce are applied as .if he is the husband himself, unle.~s the
pusband restrkts his representative to effect the divorce in a ccrtai11 way.
Divorce 1s not Vlllid unless it is pronounced by the husoond (or his
representative). In other words, if the husband has•t he intention ofdivorce without
pronouncing it, divorce is still deemed invalid. The Prophet (PBUH) says:
·"Allah hasforgiven myfollowers the evil rhought5 that occur to theit
minds, Cl$ long as such t/tou&lits 11re not put Into action ot uttered/

However, there are two exceptional cases in which divorce is valid even if
the husband (or his rcpresentativie) does not pronounce the spoken form of
divorce. The first case is when the husband writes down a direct pronouncement
of divorcing his wife provided he does intend to divorce bet Yet, scholars differ
ifhe does not have the intention of divorce by such writing, but the majority of
them are of the opinion thatdivorc:e is also valid in this case. The second case is
when a dumb husband makes an ~mderstandable ges111re indicating divorce.
Concemir\g the number of thi, pronouoc~ents .of divorce. it depends on
whether the husband is a freeman or a 8lave. but it has nothing to do with women;
Allah, Ex;ilte4 be He. addresses the l'rophctond all Muslim men saying:
"O Ptophet, when you [M:u,/ims] divorce women, divorce tMm

for [Ille commencement ofl their walling period.. .''

(Ql!r'ftn: A!-Ialaq~l)
Allah also says:
"And wlren you diwm:e 11/iomen altd they have {nearly/ fulfilled
,heirtenn•..''
(Qqr'ftn: AT-Baqai:ah: 231)

VII: DIVORCE
Moreover, the Propbet (PBUH) b'llys;

"r:>ivorce belongs .on/,, to the (me who takes hold of the leg (~e. tire
lwsbm1d),"'
A •freemmi is et1tltled to divorce his wife threl! times even if she is a slave-.
while a ~lave man i~ entitled to divorce his wife only twice even if she is a free
w9man, There is no dispute that if both the ,husband and wife are free (i.e.
not slaves), the husband is erttitied to divorce his wife th.ree times, ancl if they
are ·slaves, the husband is entitled to divorce his wife only twice, Yet, scholars
differ when either the lmsbim.d or the wffe is free w hile the other is a slave.
The preponderant view is that the number of the prononncements or divorce
is only dependent on the state of the husband, as previously explained, since
divorce is essentially a right ofthe husband not i.he wife.
It is permissible for the l\usband to make exceptions while divordng
his wife or w'ives. Such exceptiong can be related to the number of the
pronouncements of divorce, such as saying, "You are divorced Lhree times
except one (i.e. twlce):' likewise, a man can exclude one of his wives while
divorcing them , such as saying. ·•1 divotce ,ill my wives except F!J;imab".
However, the excluded thing must be half or Jess than ha]£ the general term.
1n other words, it is invalid to make the thing excepted more that\ the general
term, such as saying·to one's wife, ''You are divorced tfu-ee times except two
(j.e. once):' Moreover, it is necessary to utter the exception when it concerns
the number of divorce. For example, if the husband says to his wife, "You are
divorced three times; while having the intention of excluding one time of
divorce, it Is deemed a thieefold divorce. l'his is .because the uttered number
is considered a term that cannot be altered by 11 mere i1ttention, since the
spoken word is more reHabl.e than the hiddei1 intention, Nevertheless, it is
permissible for the ht1.Sband to exclude one ofhis wives by his !Ilere intention
while uttering the prononncement or divorce. For example, if the liusband
says, "My wives are divorced; and he intends to make an exception of one of
them, this exception is legally va1id, though it is. not verbally expressed. T/lis
is because•the words ··my wives• can refer to all or some ofthem, and thus the
intention is a decisive criterion in this case.

It is permissible to make conditions for divorce. For example, the husband
tan s-ay to hls 1v'ife, "If you enter 1.he l\ouse, you will be divorced~ making the
divorce dependent Oil her en.trance to the said house.
The only one permitted to p1ake conditions in divorce i5 thehw;band. Thus,
if ,1 man ~ays, ·•in marry so and so; r will divorce her;' lUld tben be marries

Chaprcr 3: Simu; and lnnov:1tivc Dlvon.:t

439

her, suc,h a tondition is deemed invalid. for the man was not he-r husbantl
when he made it. This is due to the /Jadith narrated on the authority of ' Amr
{bn Shu ' ayb, from his father and' his grandfather respectively, in which the
Prophet tPBUH) says:

•·rhe son of J.dmn (Atia,n) should not make II vow a/,out what he
does 11ot possess, or set free what he rtoes not possess, or divorce
what hedoes not possess."''
(Related by Ahniad, AbCi D~wl)d, :111d Al·Tirmidhi who deemed it
a hasan (good) hadit/1)
Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"O you wlio have believ,ed, wlie11 )IOU marry believing wome11
and then divorce them..."'
(Qur'an; Al•Ahz.ab: 49)
This ver5e and the aforementioned fladitli indicate rhnt a man's divorce of
an ajnabiyyal1 is invalid; there is consensus on this ruling when if is n direct
pronouncement of divorce, and It is also agreed upon by the majority of
scholars when it is a conditional p~onouncement of divorce.
Ifthe"husband" makes a concllition for divorce, cllvorce is lnvalJd unless the
condition is fulfilled. Furl·het sometimes the husband is uncertain about his
u(terance of the spoken form of divorce, the numb~rofthe pronou.ni:ements
of divorce he has made, or the folftllrnent of the divorce conditlons. If the
husband is uncertain whether h,1e has.uttered the spoken form of divorce or
not. divorce is deemed invalid, as marriage is a certain fact that cannot be
nullified by a mere doubt. Likewise, divorce is invalid if the husband doubts
the fulfillment of its conditions, as when he says to his wif-e, "lf yau enter
-such and such a house, y,;,u will be divorced:' and then he doubts whether
she has entered such a house or 1ndt, for marriage cannot be nullified due to
mere uncertainty. On the other hand, if the husband is certain that he has
divorced his wtfe but uncertain about the number of pronouncement.s 0£
divorce he has made. it is only regarded as the one pronouncement of divorce
which ht' is certain about Otheie pronouncements of divorce are not taken
into coasideration as they are still doubtful, aod the ge11eral legal pr1nciple
is that certainty cannot be nullified by mere suspicion. This legal principleis
a general, effective one_, derived1from some /Jadiths of the Prophet fPBUH)1
he .(PBUH) says:

~Leave that w/);ch makes y'111 doubt for that which dot!S not inake
you do 11 bt.»"

Taking Back C•ne's Divorced Wife
(I,taj'ah)

Taking back one's revocably divorced wife during her waiting period
without a new marriage contract is permissible according to the Qur'an, the
Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition), and the consensus of Muslim scholars.
Concerning the proof of its legality from the Noble Qur'in, Allah, Exalted
be He, says:
"...And their husbands h11ve more right to take them back In this
[period] if they want reconciliation..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 228)

Allah also says:
"Divorce is twice. Then [after that), either keep [her) in an
acceptable manner or release [her) with good treatment..."
(Qur'~: A1-Baqarah: 229)

Vil: DIVORCE

Moreover. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
'!<!:ml whe,1 they have /11early] fulfilled thelr term, eil11er retain
them according to acceptable terms orpart wllh them according
to aa:eptabfe term~.. !'
(Qur'ln: A!-Talaq: 2)

As for the Sunnah:, the Prophet (PBUH) said about lbn ' Umar when he.
divorced his wife:

"'Ordet him to take her bllck."'
Moreovc,r, he (PBUH) divorced his wife Haf~ and then look her back'.
Regarding the consensus of scholars on the legality of taki.ng one's divorced
wife back, Ibnnl-Mundhir s~id:

"Sdwfar$ u11a11imously agree I/mt takillg back ones wife during her
waitingperiod is permissible for the free matt who has made less than
tl1ree pronouncements ofdivorce (011 his wife), andfer the slave man
wlio has made less thntt two prohouncements efdfoorce." '
The wisdom behind the legality of taking one's divorced wife back is that it
i~ a ch~nce for the husband if he regrets divorcing her and wants to maintain
the marital life with her again, and this is a kind of divine m<lrcy bestowed by
AJlah upon Hi$ serva1Jts.

There are some conditions for the validity
of taking back-one's divorced wife:
i) The number of pronouncements of divorce made by the husband must
be less than tluee lfhe is a freeman and less than two ifheis a slave. lf the
husband bas alreadrused up his law(i.t] number of pronouncements of
divorce; hi& ex.-wife becomes unmarrlageable to him until she marries
and separates from another m.a n.

2) The divorce·must be after the co.n,µmmation of marriage (i.e. having
saual intercourse). If rhe husband divorces his wife before having
sexual intercourse with her, he cnnnot iake her back. for she has no
waiting period' in this case. Allah, Exulted be He, says:
"O you who ha"e belle,,ed, wlten you mor-ry believing womeu
,md then divorce lhe,;, before you l,,.ve touclied them [I.e.,
consummated tl,e nuirriage], then there is notfor you any wa1ti11g
_period to co"nt conceming tlwm. So provide for them ,md g{ve
then, a gracious- ,.·elease."
(Qur'an: Al-Ahzab: 49)

c:11'p«r 4: 'faking 11:n:k Ont's Divorced Wifd/inj'n/;J

3) The divorce must not b,: in return for a compensation given LO (he
husband. If the wife pays ,compensation to her husband to get divorced,
she becomes unlawful to him to take back unless with a new marriage
contract and with her c,Jnsenl. This is because she rans1,1ms herself
by payiug compens~tion to her husband to separate from him, nnd
taking her back ln this ,:asc contradicts her purpose in paying him
such compensation.
4) Marriage must be origirmlly val,d. 1£ the husband divnrcc.~ his wife
during an invalid marriage, he ginnot t Akc lwr bP.CK QS she be..omes
in-evocable for h:im by divorce.
5) The husband mu;! take his wife back during her wafting period, for
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

And their husbands have more r/glit· lo take them b<1rk 111
t111s [period}...''
(Qur'dli: Al-Baqarah: 228)
ri. ..

6) The husband's taking back of his wife 1nus1 not be conditional. For
example, it is invalid for .i'husband to b.iy to his e.x-wife, "If such and
such happens, l v.•ill take you back'.'
Scholars differ on whethtir it ls a condition for·the validity of returning
one's ex-wife that each of the separated couple intends reconciliati011,
Some scholars .mint>1h11:lla! it is a condition that must be fulfilled, for
Allah, Exalted be He, says in this regard:

", .. if t/1ey WIVII ret·oncWntum .. .''

(Qur\\n: Al-Baqarah: 228)

Shaykhul-blil!P lbn Tay1miyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

"The lmsband is rwt permitted to take back his wife during lier waiting
pedod unless he 'inte,uls reco11ciliotiot1 and wants to keep her i11 an
acceptable 111a1mer.1''
Some other scholars are of the opinion that the intention ofreconciliation 1.s
not a condition for the validity of taking back one\; ex-wife. They argue thai the
aforementioned noMe verse. ".,-fftlicy want recm1clliatio1t...", only calls them
to reconcile and keep away from hurting one another. but it does not mean
that reconciliation is a co11diporL Yet, the first opinion is the preponderant;
and Allah knows best.
l'hc legal spoken form pto1nounccd by the husband, to hike back his
revocable ex-wife can be through any proper words ,indicating that purp9se,
such as saying, "I take my wife back:' or, "I return to my wHi,," or the like. Taking

VU, DNORCE

back one'5 revocable ex-wife can also be vnlicl by havtng sexual intercourse
with her with the intention of taking her back actording 10 the preponderant
view in this regard.
If the husband takes his revocable e.'(-wife back, ii is an aot pf the Swmalt
to bring sortie people ns,witnesses; some scholars say that it is obligatory, as
Allah,.Exalled be He, says:

':. .. And ltri11g to wilness ·two just men from 1m1011gyou, ,."
(Qur'an: At-lWaq: 2)
And the latter is one of the opinions anributed to lmam Al:!mad. Moreover,
.Sheikh Taqiyyuddin (may Allah have mercron blm) 1,aid, ~It is by all mea11s
i11v11/idfor tht /t11sl1a11d lo lake his n'Vocnble ex-wife back secretly.'·''
The revocably divorced woma11 is•legally considered a wife of her husband

,ns long as she ls still in hei· waiting period. 'rhere{ore, her husband must
provide for her and afford bier clothing and accommodation. On the other
hand, the revocable ex-w1fe has the same dutie_q of any·wJfe; she has to stay at
her husband's house and bea,utify herselfso that he may take her back. If any
of the separated couple dies during the waiting period, 1he other is entitled to
inherit from him/her. Tn udd itlon, it is permissible for the man ,to travel with
his revocably divorced wife, ti> be alone with ber, lllld to l'lavesexual intercourse
with her with the intention 01r taking her bade.
The end of the waiting period is the dead fine for taking one's revocable exwife back Thus. if she becomes pure affer her thitd menstruation period after
the di,vorce, the waiting perfod is deemed over, and she becomes unlawful lo
him unless he remarries her wtl:h a new marriage contract, the consent of her
guatdian, and the presence ol' two ;ust witnesses. Allah, Exalted be He. says:

•~.. A11d-tlielr 1iusb11111ls /,a,,e 1110re right to take them back tn
this'[period].. .''
(Qur'an: AI-Baqarah: 22!!)
The meaning of this ver se is that when the waiting period i,s ov~r. the
revocable ex-wife becomes uoJawfultoher ex-husband unless h¢,remarries her
with a new marriage contract,, fulfilling its copditions. lf the husband takes her
back during her waifing pedod. meeting the legal conditions, the permissible
number of pronouncements l>f divorce for him becomes one less than before,
When the husband uses up the permissible number of pronouncemellts of
divorce, i.e. when he divorces h is wife for the tliird time, she becomes unlawful
for him to marry unless she lltwfuliy marries and separates from another man.
There W'e three conditions to .make such an ex-wife lawful to her first htL~band:

Chapter 4: Tiiking Back One's Divorced Wlf, (Raf nh)

445

1) She must !)larl')' another man
2) Her marriage to the other man mw;t be legal
3) Tp.e second husband must have sexual Intercourse with her
This i:. because Ailah, Exalted be He. says:
'!-tnd lfhe has divorced her [fort/If! third time], then she is not
/awful to him '!fterward until [after] sl,e marries a husband
otl,er than llim. And if he [i,e. the latter husband) divorces
her, there is 110 blame upo11 them (i.e. the woman anJ her
farmer husband} fer returning to each other if!hey thi11k thul
they ca11 keep [witllin) the limits of Allah...u

(Qur'an: AI-Baqarah: 230)
The great' Muslim scholar Cbnul-Qayyim (,,mar Allah have mer.cy•on
him) said:
"It 1s considemd 011e of tile greatest favors bestowed 11pon Muslims
that tlte irrevocable ex-wife bemmes lmvful to 111:r first husband
after site marries and then separates from another man. The law
of the Torah permit,t tile divorced woma11 to remarry her F1usband
if slie dces nor marry anorhfr man whereas tl'le lmv af the- Gospel
absolutely prohibits divorce. However. our Shari'ah (Islamic Law)
is more perfect, comprehe11sive, and suitable fer the. ititetests of
pcop/1!, Ts/am permits the Muslim man to marry four women, 11nd to
have as many slave women as he likes. Moreover, 1he Mt1s/im man
can divorce his wife and tlien. if he longs for her. he is permitted to
take her bock. ¼t, if he divorces her for the third time, it become$
proltibired for him u1 take her l>,1ck uliless she legally maMies and
separrues from another man:•

This means that the. second mno mJJSt be willing ro take .her as a wife,
not to marry bet and then separ,ites from lier to make her lawful to the first
husband; if he does so, be is considered a borrowed billy goat, as refer,red
to by the Prophet (PBUH). fn addition, 6llcli' a false marriage is invalid.
aqd it does not make the woman lawful to the first husband. And, Alfah
knows best.

Ila' (Foreswearing One's Wife More
Than Four Months)
Faqilis define ila' as the potent husband's sweariJJg, by Allah or one of His
Attributes, not to have sexual intercourse with his wifo forever or for a period
of more than four mon'ths. This definition implies that the case is not regarded
as ila' (which is prohibited in Islam) unless the following conditions are there:
I) The husband is potent.
2) The husband swears by Allah or one of His Attributes, not by divorce,
en1ancipatioo, or vow.

3) The husband swears that he will not have a legal sexual intercourse
with his wife (Le. in the vagina).
4) The husband swears not to have a legal sexual intercourse with his wife
for more than four months,
5) The wife is fit for having sexual intercourse.

VTh DIVOR,CE

1£ all the aforementioned conditions are there, the husband is legally
regarded as committing lla',.and thus the rulings on i/ii' apply to him. However.
if one of these conditions is missing, the case is not considered tM'. Ila' 1s
mentioned in the Noble Qufan, as Allah, Exalted be He, say~~
"For those who nttar not to have uxua1 relations with t1ielr
wives is a -waiting time of four months, but if they return
[to normal relations) - thetJ Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and
Mui:ifaL .And if they decide ondlv(Jn;e - then ind.Nd, AJlahis
(Qur'lin: Al-Baq,arah: 226-227)
Hearing a11d Knowing,"
The meaning of these two verses is that if the husband, who swears not to
bave sexual intercourse with his wife for more than four months, insists on not
having sexual intercourse with her after the four months, he is to be ordered
to come back ro normal sexual relation w'ith her and expiate for his oaths..
Otherwise, he must be leg<1Uy ordered to divorce her if she demands divorce:
This Islamic wise and just ruling removes the harm and injustice caused to
women and nullifies what some men used to do i n the Pre-Islamic Period of
lgnocan.ce (tbe/dhiliyy ah). when they used to prolong the period ofild'.

Ila' for more than four· months is prohibited in Lslam, as it ls an oath of
abandoning a marital obligation. As indicated in the general meaniqg of the
aforementioned verses, the husband is not considered to have forsworn his
wire unless he can validly divorce her, whether he is a Muslim, .i disbeliever,
a freeman, a slave, 11n adult, or a percipient child (who will be legally ordered,
when he reaches puberty, either to have normal (sexuaf) relation with his wife
or to divorce her). The ruling on i ld' is also applied even If the husband made
it when angry, or while sufferlng from a curable disea.1e. Moreover, its ~uliog
is also applied even if the marriage is not yet consummated (i.e. the married
couple haye not had sexual intercourse yet).
However, the husband is not considered to have forsworn having sexual
intercourse his wife if he is Insane or w1consdous, in which cases man is
Unaware of what he is saying and the Intention is lacking. In addition., the
c-ase is not regarded as ilii' if the husband is impotent, such as a castrated or
a paralytic, for hi~ oath is not the only Ie"dSOn for hisahandoilh1ent of having
sex11al intercourse with his wife.
The case is also deemed Ila' if the husband swears by Allah that he will
not have sexual intercourse with his wife forever, or for a period more than
four months, or wl:)en he stipufate&something unexpected to happen before
four months, such as the Advent of Je~u~ Chrisl·, the son of Mary (l?BUH),

Ch•prcr 5: //.f (Fore,wcaring On~•• Wifi: More 'thao liour Monchsi

449

or the coming out of the Antichrist. Likewise, the c.1se is considered !/ii' if
the husband makes a con(iition that his wife must commit a prohibited deed
or leave an obligation. For example, he may say to her, " I swear by Alla!> that
I will not have sexual intercouts,e with you UI)til you abandon p~rforming
prayer (or drink 'l~ine, etc.)." Tl::cis is because he stipulates what is legally
forbidden, which is slmliar to th,:, case of stipulatlng something impossible
to happen.
In all the previous cases, the period of il,f must not exceed four months. ,as
Allah. Exalied be He, says:
"For tl1ose who swear no•t to have snual relatio,u witl, their
wives is a waifing time offour mo11tfts..."
(Qur'm Al-Baqarah: 226)

Jt iS related in ~ahili Al-B11kh,'irt (Ai-Bukliiiri~ A111he11tic Book of Hadfil1>
that [bn "Uinar (may Allah be pte,ase-d with him) said,

"When the•four months a1-e over, the husbcmd ,m~t be legally
ordered either to give up ilti' (i.e. to have normal se1CUal re/Qt/on
with his wife) or to divorce ,lier. slili divorce is 11ot effected unless
the husband makes il's pro11i11mceme111." 1
The same ruling was related by Al•Buk.ll'~ri on the authority of more rha11 t~t'l
Companions ' .
Sulaymait lbn Yas4r said:

"I wa.< a contemporary of III ore th,m ten of the Compattions of the
Messenger of Allah (PBUH) 11nd aii of them were of the opinion r/rat
when thefo11r inonlhs 11re over. lhe husband must be legally ordered
•eit/ter to give up i/a?or to divorce lier:"'
This is also the opinion of the cna/ority of Muslim scholars and the apparent
meaning of the aforementioned C,ur'antc verses.
'The days of menstruation are not legally included in the four months of
!Id'. Uthe husband has sexual intercourse with his wife after this period 1s
over, he is considered to have remrped, to n.otmal marlta\ !J.fe with his wife, as
having sexual intercourse is a sign of rel.urning to normal martial life. lbnulMnndhir saia, ':4s far as 1 am concerned, all scholars unanimously agree. fhal

Thus, !he woman regains her madtdl right from her husband.

If t'he fon, momhs ate over ru'ld the· husband still refuses to hayc seJ(ua]
intercourse with his wife, he must be fo,,ced by the judge to divorce her,
provided lt is the wife's wish. This is because Allah, Exnlted he He, says:
':41,d if they decide' on divorce - tllcn i11deed, Allah is Hearing
and K11owi11g."
(Qur'an; AI-Baqarah: 227)

However, if such a husiland still ,efl,se~ either to have normaj &exuul
relatjo11 with his wjfc or to dJvorce her, the judge divorces her or cancels U,e
marriage contract, as rhe judge is legaUy considered the husband's .guardian in
this case, so he is cntltled lQ divorce her on behalf of the husband.
Faqihs apply the same rulings tu those men who im.·xcus:iblyand harmfully
abandon paving sexual intercnurse with their wives for more than four months,
even if without forswearing. The same applies in ca&e of nluir for,-a period that
exceeds four months after which the husband still refuses to expiate fo.r ii.
TI1ese two cases have the san1e ruliogo11 1/fi', a6 husbands in both cases abstain
fl'om having sex· w'ith their wives, c-au;;ing them harm. And Allah, Exalted be

He, knows best
It may happen that the four months of i/a' are over while any of the spouses
has a ceriain excuse that makes him/her unable to h.ave sexual intercourse as a

sign <)f returning to nm,:ridl marital life. Ln such a case; scholars maintain that
th<' husband must be legally ordered to retur.n to his wife by saying something
indicating returning lo normal sexual relation withoneanother, such as saying,
"I \viU !lave Sl!JCual intercourse with you on~e 1 can:' This is because ti1.e main
purpose of re.t11rning to one's wife is giving up the intention of harming her
(through /Iii?, S11ch a statemen t made by the hll5band indicates his intention
nof to harm his wife (by I/ii') any mo,e, Afterwards, when he becomes able to
bave sexual intercourse, he has either to h~ve sexual intercourse with his wife
or tu divorce her, as the excuse for not having se,cual intercourse is.no lo11ger
there; and Allah knows best;

Zihar

Ziliar is the saying by a husband to his wile, when he wants to abstain from
having sex with her, "(Sexually,) you are to me like the back of my mother:'
Sometimes the husband likens his wife to his sister or any woman prohibited
for him due to blood relations, breastfeeding, or relations by marriage, instead
of saying "my mother", wb ile pronouncing ~ihiir.
Z.il11lr is prohibited according to the Qur'iin, as Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"Those who pronou11ce the ;.ihar amo11g you [to separate] from
their wives - they are not (consequently] their mothers. Their
mothers are no11e but those who gave birth to them. And indeed,
they are sayi11g an objectionable statement and a falsehood, .."
(Qur'an: Al-Mujadilah: 2)

The meaning is that those men, who pronounce ~ilulr, say grievous and
false words that the Shari· ah (Islamic Lavi) disapproves of. Such words are

VII: DIVORCE.

452

!llere lies and objectionable ~totements that -are definitely prohibited, for such
a man prohibits for himself what Allah has not prohibited for him, making bis
wife sexually prohibited for litilnself as if she is his mother, though she is not.
l,.ihlir was considered a kind of divorce dur ing the Pre-Islamic Pedod of
Ignorance (the Jtlhiliyya/1), b,ut afterwards lslam repudiated it and con.sidered
it an oath re"luiring expiati,on. Thus, the man who pronounces zif•iir and
his wife are prohibited to el\joy one another by having sexual intercourlie or
even fore"ptay until the husb;ind expiates his pronouncement of ~ilr. This is
because Allah, Exalted be He, says;
~d those who prcinounce iillar from their wives and then
Jwish to].go.back 0111 Whatthey said - then [there must be] the
frectng ofa slave be.fore ihey touch one a,1other...''
(Qur'iin: AI-Mujadilah: 3)

Moreover, the Prophet (P•BUH) said LO a man who pronounced ~ihar from
his wife:
"Then do not approach her (i.e. do not have Intercourse with her)
until you do what Allllth ordered you to do (i.e. until you expiate
for it)."'

(Ilelated by. At-Tirmidhi who deemed it a .ab.th badith.).

S-0, the man who pronow1ces4 ihdrfrom his wife must expiate his ;.ihar first
if he wants to have sexual ihtercourse with her, for Allah, l'!xalied be He, says:
"; ..then [there must beJthef~i,agofa slave before they toudl
.l
one 11rtotl1er. That is what you are 11dmon/shed thereby; a1u
Allah is Acquainted with what you do. And he who daes not find
{a slave] - lhen a fart for two months consecutively before they
to11ch one another;.:•
(Qur'an: AI-Muj.\dilah: 3-4)

These two noble verses i11dicate that It is obligatory for l he husband who
has pronounced ;:;ihar to expi.atefor it before having sexual intercourse with his
"Wife, and that his wlfeis prohlihited for him.until he expiates bis pronouncement
of ;:;ihar. This ls the opinion ,of the majority of the scholars in this regard.
To expiate. his pronouncement of ;:;illar, the husband must follow rhe
~equence of expiations ment.ioned ill the aforementioned verses. He must
free a slave if possible; otluirwfse, he must owerve fasting for two months
.oonsecutively, and if he can111ot due to au illness or I.he like, the last alternative
for him is to feed sixty poor persons. Allah, Exalted be He. says:

Chapc,r 6: Z/hdr

453

'~J those 1t1lio J,ro1101mce :ihtlr from their wiv;s and then
[wish to] go b~k on what they said - then [there must be) t/Je
/relling of a &/4ve before they touch 011e another. That is what
you are admonished thereby; an4 Allah is Acquainted with wha1
you do. And he who does notfind fa slave.] - then ,a fast for two

months consecutively before tlJey to/4CI, one another; and lie who
is unable - then ti1e feeding ofsiKty pnor persons..."

(Qur'ani AI-Muj~dilah; 3-4)

In ti\~ :aforetnenlioned verses, Allah states that ''those who prono11t1ce
gihAr from tl1e1n..ive$'' and then regret it and wish to return to normal se..xual
relations with them have to expiate for their pronouncement of Iihar ''befdrt1
they touch or;e anothetl' Such e:xpfatlon can be one of three things:

1- Emancipation of a Slave
The expiation of tih/Jr can be. thrmtgh "freeing of a J/aw" if the husband
has any, or able lo afford to buy one with hi~ surplus money (that is not needed
to meet his essenli~I needs and rhe needs o(those whom he supports).
The ~lave to be freed mus.t be a believer, as Allah :stipulates a believlng slave
for the expiation P.rescribed for manslaughter; Allah, Exalted be iie, says:
". .. And wl,oever kills a believer by,mistake - then fhefreei11g ofa
belle>'lttgsla~t..."
(Qur'an: Art-Nisal: 92)

Thus, according to '.lnalogical deduction, the slave to be freed lo expiation
for vliar must be a believer as well, for the unrestricted ruling prevails over
the restricted similar one. J\:l~o, the slave to be freed in expiation for ~ihiir
mu.st be free of any Jefect that badly affects his/her ability to work, for tne
emandpation ls intended to free the slave and enable him/her to earn hislher
JiVi:n,g. This cannot be achieved if the slave is afflicted with a defect that badly
affects his/her ability·io work, such as blindness, pa~ysis, and the like.

2~ Fasting for Two Successive Months
There are three condition5 for the validity ofexpiating ii/1ar through fasting:
I) l11e husband must be unable to free a slave.
2) The hus6and must observe fasting for two consecutive months, during
which he is prohibiled to interrupt his fasting except for an obligatory
fasting, like fasting the month of RamaJiAn. It js also P.rohibited (u

454

interrupt those two months of fasting except for ~ 9bligatory
breaking of fasting, like that on the days of the Two 'Ids (Feasts) and
011 the Days of Truhrfq ( 11 '" , 12"' and 13'" of bhul-Hijjah; the three
days following the Day of S~critke). Fasting those rwo months can
also be interrupted if there is a J~gal excuse, such 11s an fXhausting
journey or an illness. Breaking tl1e f11s( due to either of the above

2) The poor person to be fed must be a free Muslim entitled to receive

Li 'an (Allegation of Adultery
Sworn against One's Wife)

Allah, Exalted be He, prohibits Muslims to falsely accuse the innocent
people of adultery, and He threatens those committing such a sin with severe
punishment. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"Indeed, those who (falselyJaccuse chaste, unaware and believing
women are cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and they will
have a great punis/1ment. 011 a Day whe11 their tongues, their
hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to what
they used to do. That Day, Alla/, will pay them i11 full their true
{i.e., deserved] recompense, aud they will know that it is Allah
Who is the Manifest Truth {i.e., Perfect in justice/."

(Qur'an: An-Nur: 23-25)

4-58

YU, UtVORCF:

Moreover, 11,llah has ord,iined that \\'hoever accu&es a Muslim of adultery
or fornication withou1.pmducing four witnesses must be punished with eighty
lashes and considered a defiantly disobedient person unless he repents 11fter
that artd corrects himself. Allah, Ex11lt.ed be He, says:
~d those who accuse chaJte wometi and tlum do riot prod11ce
four witnesses - l11sJ1 them eighty lashes 1»1d do not accept
from them testimony ever after. And those are the defiantly
-disobedie~t. E:tc,pt far tliase who repent after tliat and correct

tllemselves, For. i11dtt.d, Allah is Fo1b.;ving and Mercifi1I,"
(Quean: An-Ntlr: 4-5)
Tbe ;i.forementioned verses show the sfern'])unishmentand ruling applied
when a Muslim accuses a woman other than his wife of adultery. However,
when a Muslim man accuses his own wife with adultery, there is another •
ruling to be apphed called the /i' tln. U' an is four testimonies ensured by
sworn oaths taken by eacb spouse, and accompanied by Ule .;urse or wrath of
Allah upon the liar, as- will soon be explained. lf a man charg~5 his wife with
adultery and cannot produce dear evidence (through witnesses), li'iin can
spare l)im the legal pu111Sh1nent for the false accusation of adultery. Allah,
Exalted be He,,says:
"And those wl,a accuse tlieir wives [of adullery] and li11ve 110
witnesses except them.selves - then tire·wit11ess of 011e of them
{sliatl be] four testimoni.l!S'{swearing] by Allah tl,at indeed, he ls
of the truthful. And tht fifth [oaJh will be/ that the curse of.4/lalt
be upon him if lie should be lPIJ011g lhe liars. But It will preve,u
punishme,it from her ifshe gives four testimonies [swearing] by
Allah that indeed, he is oftlie liars. And lhe fifth [oath wlll beJ
Jhatthe wrath ofAllah be upon her ifhe was .o f the tn,t/rfal."

(Qur'an: Ail-Nllr: 6-9)
Thus, the husband says fuLLr times, "I testify by Allah that my wife has
committed adultery:' He must point at his wife if she is present, or mention
her name \f she is absent. In the fiffh testimony; he says the same 'but he
adds, "... and may the curse of Allah be upon me if I am lying:' Ill reply and
defense, the wife says four times, "I.testify by Allah that he is lying aboql tile
a dultery he has charged me with:' In the fifth·testimony, she says the same
but she adds, ", .. and may the wrath of Allah be upon me if he is telling.the
truth." This is because the one who knows the truth and denies it IDC\ll'.S the
"wrath~ of Allah.

There are some conditions forthe validity of It' 11n:
• The two spouses are legally,accountable.
• The husband charges his wife with adultery.
• The ,~tjfe keeps on refuting hirn and cbarging him with lying until the
end of li' dr,,
• The li't/11 is coudltcted by a juclge
Jfthe case of Ii •iin nieet~ all the aforementioned conditlons a11d is mad~ iq

the afore.mentioned way; it results in the following legal rulings:
I) The husband becomes no loo.gediable to be plu1•ished for false accusal'ioo oi adulte{y,
21 The couple must be ~epar,ated, a11d the wife becomes prol1ibitcd for the
husband to remarry forever:
3) Her child will nu longer bt:ar th( name of the husband if the latter
denies tbe child during Ii 'all 'by saying, "This child is not mine."
The husband resorts to /i'an if he sees his 1:vife committing adwtery bur
'h e cannot produce evidence, or if be has strong presumptions that his wife
,;omrujts adwtery, as when be sees a wicked mnn notorious for dissolution
•s ecretly visiting her. Therefore., there is a legal "1sdom behind the prescription
of li'tin; namely that it spares the husband the disgrace and shame ofhis wife's
adwtery, the painM marital life with her, and the paternity of a child who fs
not his. The husband cannot often produce the evidence ofhi.s wife's adultery,
and his wife does not often confess her crime. Accordingly, siuce the husband's
accusaiion cannot be accepted without evidence, the only legal solution
is pubUc imprecntion through strong oaths taken by the spouses. Thus, the
prescription of the /i'{in solves th~ problem ofruch a husband and relieves him
from any diseomfort.
Since the husband has i:lll witness against his wffe but himself, the wifo is
legally entitled to oppose bis testimonies by equivalent repeated testimonies to
avert the punishment If tbe husbaud refrains from swearing the allegation of
adultery against his wife in the way mentioned above, he is to suffov the legal
punishment for false accusation. Likewise. if she refuses to swear by Allah
that he is teliing lies in the way previousiy painted 0111, his testfmoales are
considered irrefutable evidence of her sin. l'n this regard, lbnul-Qayyim ,;rud:
"This .ruling on Ii' dn acc()rds with the legal proofs. According fo

lt is also t/ie opii,icm 1naii1taii1ed by Shayklwl-lslam lbn 'faymiyah

According to the Sunnalr (Prophetic Tradition), the proof of the legality
ofresorting to ii 'chi when necessary is, the badilfr related by Al-Bukhari ;ind
Muslim on the authority of lbn •Umar:

"When 1h11 ' U,nar (r.nay Allah be pleased wiih him) was asked
If there should be sep,~ration between the two spouses in case of

(the Prophet) about .it was so and so. lie said, 'O Messenger
of ;1,llah! if one of us finds liis wife com111ilting adultery, what
should he do? If he talks, fhal is something great, aud if he
keeps silent; that is a,!so something great,' The Prophet (PBUH)
kept quiet and did not answer him. After some time, he (that

He (the man) said, 'No, by Him Who sent yvu with Truth as·

called her (t11e man'$ wife), ndmonislied her, exhorted her, and
i1Jformed lier that the, tonnent of this world is less painful than
that of the Hereafter. She said, 'No, by Him Who sent you with

Establishing Paternity

If a man's wife or bondmaid gives birth to a child, the man is considered to
be his father when there is a possib,ility that the child cou.ld be his, as when the
woman is living with him as his wi lfc. This is because the Prophet (PBUJ-I) said:

.,

'The child belongs to the owner of the bed (i.e. the husband or the
master.
)
There are three cases in which there is a possibility that the child belongs
to a certain man:
The first case is when the wo,man is his wife and gives birth to her child
after half a year of their fin;t sexual intercourse, whether the man lives
with her or not, since the newborn baby can be this man's child and
there is nothing to prove otherwise.
The second case is when the woman is divorced and gives bitth to her
child after less than four years after her irrevocable divorce, for the

464

Vll: DIVORCE

maximum period of pregnancy is four years. ln this case, there is a
possibility that !he c:hild is from her ex, husband, and thus tbe dtild is
attributed to h isn,

1n the two aforesaid cases, the husband must be teu years old or more
(to be able to IUlve children), for the Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Command yo11r chi/dre11 to pmy when they become seven (years old)
and beat them for (neglecting) it (i.e. prayer) when they beGome tert
(years old); and,arr,ange thei; beds (to sleep) separately.#
The Prophet's cornmand to make the children sleep separately
when they become te11 years old is a proof that they can have sexual
intercoui:se. which leads to pregnancy and giving birth. This implies
that a ten-year-old child can be-a father even though his puberty is not
evident, as ,puberty is evident only when its signs are apparent on him.
·rtius. Muslim sd\o;lars are of the opinion that the. husb~nd's ability to
have sexual iniercourse is enough to make the newborn baby belong
to hil!l, and thus f,>eoples lineages being preserved.

Tbe third case lin which the newborn baby can belong to the husband)
i~ when the revoc:ably divorced wife gives birth to her chil'd in a
four-year period sl'arting after divorce and before th~ CJC:piry of her
waiting period. The same applies when the revocably divorced wife
gives birth to a chilJ before a four-year period after the expiry of her
Waifing period. Th,is is because the ruling on a revocpbly divorced
woman ,In her waiting period is the same as that of a wife, so the
ruling on paternity in case of revocable divorce is similar 10 that in
case of b~ng mar-r'ied.
If a master admits that he has had sexual intercourse with bis b,mdmaiil,
or ifihere is a proofof their sexual intercourse, then the child she gives birth to
5ix months or more after the intercourse belongs to this man. T)lis is because
she is legally considered his l1nvful ,voman by 5uch intercourse, according lo
the gerieraiity of the /J.adilh in which the Prophet (l'BUH} said:

"The child belongs to Ille owner of tlte bed (i.e. the husband or the
m4ster·of a sla,,e girl)."
lf a mastet admits that he has had sexual intercourse with his bondmaid,
and then he has sold her or set bet free, he ls considered the father of the dtild
she gives birth to in less than six months after bee sale or emancipation. This is
because the minimum period of pregnaocy is six months, and if this bondmaid

Chapr.!r S, Esrablishing Paceruiry

gives birth to her child in less than six mon1hs after rheir separatiqn, anJ.her
eh1ld lives, it becomes clear lhat she had· conceived her child when she had
been her m;\Ster's lawful womnn l~efore her sale or emancipation; the Prophet
(PBUI-1) said:

"The c/,ild belongs to the pwner of tile bed (i.e. the husband or
.the master)."

There are two cases in wh.idi, lhe child cannot belong to the husbi;md:
The firsl case is when lhe w,Jman gives blrth to an alive child in a period
less than six mo111hs aftei: her marriage, for this periud is not enough
for conceiving and giving blrth to n child. In this case, the wife must
have been pregnant before her maniage to her present husband.

The second case is when the husband irrevocably divorces his wife and then
she gives birth lo a child i1.1 "more" than four years after divorce. This is
because it is evident thai she has conceived the cl1ild after her divorce.
The cJiild o( a bondmaid will not belong to her muster if be claims that he
made sure she had her menstrual period after having sexual intercourse witb
him, as this makes him certain sh,: did not conceive a child after having sexual
intercourJ>ewith him. Therefore.her child surely belongs to another man. The
master's clai1n is accepted in thi!; case, as ii is so difficult to verify whether
she ·really had her meostruaLp~ri,od and' did not conceive a child after hav'ing
seirual intercourse with him or not. However, such a cla'im to disown the chfld
is not legally accepted unless the: master takes an oath and swears by Allah
1bat this child does not belong to him. as he thus denies any duty related ,to his
paternity of the child,.
If there Is a dispute over tl1e lineage of a newborn baby. the l.twful bed
relations are leg:\lly more consid,!!red than a mere resemblance betwe.en the
newborn baby and i1s claimet. FOi: example, when a master claims the child of
his ,bondmaid to be his and anotlrer man who bad sexual intercourse with her
dnims-the child bec;tuse the child! resembles him, the·child legally belongs ro
the master,. f~r- the. Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Tlie chi/a belongs to the 011-•11er of tlte l1c,J (i.e. the husband or the
master of a slave girl)!'
The child follows the pedigree! ofhls fo1her, for Alla)), ExaHe<l •be 1{e, say1;:

"Call thetn by [ the names <if] their fatl1e1'$ .. .''
(Qur\in: AJ-A!!zab: 5)

VII: DtVORCL::

466

However, when it comes- to the child', ·religion, J,he child follows the better
religion of his parents, For example, tf a Ch rlsti'nn man marries a pol'ythe1H
woman or vice versa, the child follows Christianity. Yet, the child foliows
his mother conceming freedom or slavery, except when there is a previous
condition or a lcind of deceptlon,
After thls quick illosttation of the f,slamic rulings on the establishment of
pa1ernlty and verification of liMage, we realize the keen interest of Islam to
protect and verify people's pedigrees as there .ire ~onsequent interests, such as
maintaining the ties of kinship, inheritance. guardianship, and the l1ke. Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
"O mankii1d, i1,Jeed We have created you jl'om male 111,il female
a11d madeyou peoples and tribes tl,at you may k,1ow 011ea11other.
Tt1deed, the most noble of you in the sighr of Allah Is the most
righteous ofyo11. ftldeed, Allah is K11ow/11g a11d ~cq,uainted.»

(Q11ian; Ai-HujurM: 13)
Moreover, the verification of the lineage is not intended for boastfulness
nnd chauvinism known during the Pre-Islamic Period of lgnoranee (the
fMiliyyah). Rather, it aims at cooperatiort, maintaining the .blood ties, and
being merciful towards one another. May Allah guide u" all to what He likes
and pleases.

Waiting Period

The waiting period is a result of divorce, and it refers to a legally specified
period of waiting after divorce. The proofs of the waiting period are derived
from the Noble Qur'an, the Swmah (Prophetic Tradition) and the consensus
of Muslim scholars.
Concerning the proofs in the Noble Qur'im, Allah, Exalted be He. says:

"Divorced wom11n remain ill waiting [i.e., do not remarry] for
three periods ..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 228)
He also says:

'l4.nd those who no lollger expect menstruation among your
women - if you doubt, then their period Is three months, and
[also for] those who have not menstruated. And for those who
are pregnant, their tem, is 1mtll they give birth ..."
(Qur'an: A!-Ialaq: 4)

Vll:QIVORCE

468

This ,c-0ncems tl)e cases 0£ separaiion between wife-and husband in lite.
However, concem111g lh.e case of the death of the husband, Allah, Exalied be
He. says:

•~nd those wlw n,·~ taken i11 death n,nong you and leave 1vi¥e5
beltlnd - thty, [the wives, s1,ull] wn/tf('µrmontlts and ten {days]»
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 234)
The proof derived from the S1m1111fris th,e /!adtth narrated on the authority:
of' A'i.shah (may Allah be pleased witl1 her) who saicu

"Bartrnh was orderec/ (b,t the f'rophel) lo count three monf11Jy.
periods as a waiti,rg period."'
(J<elated by Ibo Miljah)

There are other b.adit/Js jndic.1ting the sa111e legal ruling.
As !or the wisdom behlnd the prescription of the waiting period, it is to
make sure the woman has not concelved a child before separating from her
husband, in order not to let any confusion take pll1ce concerning the lineage of
the child. Moreover, this waiting p~riod gives the husband the chance to repent
divorcing her and to take his wife ba~k 35 long as his divorce is revocable.
Honoring the marriage contr11ctand pointing out its sanctity are also intended
through the prescri.Ption of tbe waiting period, nnd so is esteeming the rlght
of (he a-husband. Besides, the right of the fetus is highly observed, through
the prescription of the walling period when the divorced wife is pregna1tt In
general. the waiting period is considered protective of tlie previous maniage.

'The waiting period is obligatory upon every woman who has separated
from her husband whether by divocce, by lhe klu.11' (wife's release agoinst
payment), by a dissolution of the marriage contract, or by the death of her
husband. It is a condition to make the waiting period valid th;rt such a husband
consciously had pdvaC)' with the wife with her consent and he w-.1s i,otent,
whether she w,IS a freewoman or a slave girl, an adult or a mfnor of those fir to
have sexual intercourse.
As forlhe woman from whom her husband separates before consummating
marriage with her, whether through divorEe or the !ike. while be is ;llive, she
'has no waiting period. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"O you wlw have believed, wl1e.11 you marry bdievi11g women

tmd tf11m divorce them befere ya11 have to11ched tl,em [i.e.,
co11s1m1mated the marriage}, lhetr there is trotfor yo11 atl)' waiting

pe,·lod to t·o11111 co11cen1ingthe111..."

(Qur'an: Al-Ahzab: 49)

Ch•pter 9: W:ildng l'eciocl

tl69

The verb "to count" in the verse re(ers to counting the periods or months
to deterrnine the 'time of the waiting period, and "have touched them" implies
having sexual intereourse with them. The noble verse indicates that there is
no waiting period for the woman divorced before comummating marriage,
and there is no dispute among scholars over this ruling. The mentioning of
the "believ/11g women" in the verse ls a mere reference to the majority of the
wives of Muslims, since Muslim scholars unanimously agree that there ls
no difference between the believing women and those· of tp.e People of the
Scripture (Christiao or'Jewish women) concerning this ruling.
However, when the husband dies, his wife must count her prescribed
,\tailing period whethec· be bas had cons1UDmated the marrlage or not, foi:
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

':<ind those who are taken in death an,011g yo" ,md leave
wives behind - 1hey, Jth.e wives, shall] wait four months llJtd
ten [days]..."
(Qur'an: Al,Baqara.h: 234)
Moreover, there is no legal text or proof to differentiate between the
consummated and unconsummated marriages in this respect
There '<Ire six kinds of women in their waiting period:
1) The pregnant widow or the pregnant divorced woman

2) The non-pregnant widow

3) The dlvorced woman who still has lier monthly mensl:nlal period
4) The divorced woman who does 1101 have a monthly menstrual period,
due to young age ·or menopause
5) The divorced woman who no longer has her monthly mepstrual period,
without an apparent reason
6) The wife of? missing man

Concerning the pregnant widow or lh.e pregnant divorced woman, her
waiting per-iod lasts until she gives birth, for Alloh, Exalted be He, says:
''. ..And for those who are pregnant, their term is urttiJ they
give birth..."
(Qur'ru1: At-Talaq: 4)

1'he noble ,verse indicates that the walting period of the pregnant woman
ends when shegives birth. Sorneofthe So/af(early Muslim scholars) 1naintained
that the pregnant widow must consider the lon,J!er period: either until she gives
birth or until four months and ten days palls . Howeyez:. afterwards, Muslim

VII: 1)1\lORCE

470

scholars Unanimously agreed that the waiting period for the pregnant-woman
endt when she gives bitth, whether she is -a divorcee d or a widow.
However, the waiting period prescribed for the pregnant woman does not
end i(she miscarries, and her embryo as a mere unformed lump of flesh. lbe
\Val ting period of the pregnant wpma11 ends when she gives birth to a newborn
thnt belongs to the separated (by divorce,. death, ere.) husband; thus, her
waitingperioJ does not end if ~he gives birth to a child that does not belong to
the separated husband, For example, if the husband Cllllnot have children due
to a congenit~! pefect or young age, or when t~e chil\i is bor11 alive in a _period
of pregnancy less than six mo11tl1s after consummating their marriage, this
child does not belong to this separated husband. 1'herefore, her waiting period
does not end by givrng birth' ln•such cases.
The minimum period of pregnnncy fs six months. as Allah, Exalted be i-le. says:

''. ..and his gestaHnil and weaning [period] is thirty months..."
(Qur".\n: Al-Ahqaf: IS)

A11d
"Motl,ers may nurse (i.e., breustfee,lJ their childrm IWO
complete years..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqanih: 233)
If w_,; subtract the- period of breastfeeding, twen.ty-four months, fro/TI
thirty months, the remaining is 6iX months which is the rt1iniJ110m period of
pregn~ncy, and there is no dlild that can live if born in less thon six 1nonths
after concept'ion.
Muslim schoiarsdlffer on determining the maximum period ofpregnancy.
The most preponderant view is that this period depends on the actual cases
that have already,occurred. Al 0Muwaffaq Ibn Qudamah said, "When there #
110 legal text. we must r(!$ort ro /he oclttal cases.
some case$ ofpreg,tmtejl

Coocerning the non-pregnant widow, her waiting period is four months
and ten d·ays, whether her husb~11d has died before or after the ooaswnrrmtion
of marriage, and whether she is Jfit to h;rve sexual intercoun;e or not. Thi, is

Al-Waztr and other scholars stated, "'Scholars 1mnnfmo11sly agree tlrat //,e

As for the widowed slave girl,. she must observe half the waiting period of
tl1e free widow; that is two montlhs and five days (including £ive nights). This
is be,ause the Prophet's Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all)
unanimously agreed that the divor~ed slave girl must observe half the-waiting
period prescribed for the free divorced woman, and so is the ruling on ,!he
widowed slave gitl compared to thaf on the free widow. Al-Muwaffaq lbn

There.are some Rulings pertaining to the Widow
The widow must spend her prescribed waiting pedod in the house whei:e she
was staying at the death of her husband, and .It is impermissible £or her to leave
this house exi;ept fo!' a Jeg,tl excuse, ns the Prophet (PBUH) said to a widow1
''Stay at yoicr home.•'
In another narration, he (l'BUH) said ~

"Stay during your waiting period iri the house where yo11 we.re
i11fom1ed ofyo11r /111sband's deatl,.'''
(Related by the Compilers of the S11111211)"
However, if the widow is obliged to move into nriother house, she is
permitted to gll wherever she desires in order to avert any harm. For example,
~he cnn leave the house if she fears for herself from staying there or is forced
to leave it, or if the house i~ rented and its owner ask.sher to leave or asks for
a higher rent.
lt is i,ermis$ible for the w~dow to go out from her house for bet needs
during the daytime, not at nlght when e'vil incidents are expected, for the
Prophet (PBUH) said to the widows observing waiting periods:
"Talk ils mud, as you wllltt at the home ofone ·o fyou and when }'QI'
want to sleep, then everyone ofyrm should return to her home!'''
Moreover, it is obligatory fer the widow to show the.signs ·o fher mQuming
by avoiding all thllt ,vti:ich may arouse others' desire towards her Of .make her
attractive to look at With regard to this., lh.e great scholar ImAm Ibnul•Qayyim
{may Allah have mercy on him) said:
•This (the widow'.f mourning over her late husband) indicate.s the
perfection and wisdom of the Tslamfc Shari 'ah (lilami, Law) and
hOlY it tiloroughly looks after t11e interests of Muslims. Mour:11i11g

(the Jdliil/yyah). During such days, the widow ,~d to stay in the

her body, taking a bath or suchlike ads thai indicate dissatisfaction
with tl1e.Divine Pn,destinqtio,r. Out ofFlis mercy. Allah, Exalted be.

patieric~, t/1an/cji,lness, and tumi11g bn,k lo A1111h /Jy saying 'Indeed,

disaster of d~at/r natumlly ca11ses pain and sad11ess to the people
of the dece,1sed, Alla/1, the Wise, the Acquainted, allows trnim (lhe
relatives oth11r than the wife) to shaw an9•a.few Signs af mo11r11ing,
that last for three days only in order to provide them with camfo,·t
and release their sadness. So, mourning is prohibitccJ aftert/te:se thr.ie
Jays as it is considered.a prospective evi,1- What is meant here is 1hat
All11f1 permits women to mour11 over their deceased. other tlum rl1e
l11uba11d, for tlrree days. However, mouming over the husband is
related ta the waiting period as it Is aon.sidered of its necessities and
complementary practices."
As for the pr~gnanl widow, she ends he.r obligatory mourning as soon as
sbe gives birth to her child. Her mourning is restricted to her waiting period
and ls complementary to it, and one of its rulings and obligations. Therefore,
her mourning is obligatory as long as she is still iu her waiting period.
Imam lbnul-Qayyim then said;

':-1 woman needs to adorn herself to ·l,e lovely for her /·11.1sbal'fd. When
Ire dies and she is still in her waitit,gperiod and cannot be the Wife
of another man, she must be prevented from doing what a woman
does fur he1· husb1111d, in order ta observe the right of the deceased
/111.1band by prevei'ftii1g hmclf from another mat1 until the decreed
waiting period l!Tlds. This <1/$0 helps block the mearis to desire men or
be desired 'by men if she adorns herself.""
Therefore, the widow in her waiting period must avoid adorning herself by
applying dyes,.henna, and the like. She must not wear ai1y jewelry, apply any
perfume, or wear any adorned clothes, as she has to wear only unadorned ones.
l'{owever, there is no special .clothing for the mourning period, and hei1ce the
1,1dow can wear her us1:1a.l c1othes except the adorned ones. When her waiting
period is over, $he has no legal obligation to say or do anything, unlike what
some common people think.
The waiting period prescribed for the woman who 110 longer ~xpects
menstruation is three monlhs, for Allah, mlted be He,,says:

'l<\"d those who 110 lot1ger expect n,enstru1d/on 11nio11g your
wom~,, - ifyou ilnu"bt, 1/um theirperwd.u three ma11tl1s..!'
(Qur'an; At-Ialiq: 4)

VII, DTVORCE
The prescribed wailing period for~ ,tivorced woman, 1Vho rs not pregnant
and still has menstrual pe.riods, io three menstrual periods; (or Allah, El\alt~d
be He, says:

"Divorc,ul wo111e11 remain in wailing {i.e., do nQt remArryJ for
three periods, Qnd.il is 11ot lawfulfor them to conceal what AU<lh
/,as created i,ttl,eir wombs ...#
(Qur'~n: J\J iBaqarah: 228)
This noble verse1ndicale,s that the divorced woman must observe a wailing
period of thtee menstrual p,erioc\s, and then she can remarry if she likes. ·rt,~
word ~peti!lds'' mentioned in the verse refers to menstrual periods, as narrated
from "Umar lbnul -Kha_ttAb; •Ali lbn Abu I'/ilib, and Ibo . Abbas (may Allah be
pleased witb them all). The Prophet (PBUH) used the same word to refer to
the same meaning as he ( PR UH) said lo a woman in a state of istibfldPh (i.e. a
woman havingv;\ginal bleedling other Chan menstruation);

"... When yourmenstr,,wtio11 comes, dQ not perform prayer."1)
Moreover, these three menstrual periods must be complete, and thus if
Che woman is divorced during her menstrual period, this period will not be
cowited as one of the three lmenstrual periods presc__ribed for her as a wailing
per,iod. It is worth mentiorning that though divorce is _prohibited during the
menstrual pe.rlod, It is legally valid.
The presGribed waiting period for the divorced ~lave girl Is on ly two
menstrual periods, for the P1rophet (PBUH) said:

"The- IVafting period of the slave wom1111 is two monthly periods."
This ls the opinion of ' 1Umat, hls son (' Abdull~h Ibn 'Umar), and • Ali
lbn AbO Dlib, and no one of the Prophet\; Companions opposed dtls opinion.
Thus., this ruling makes an exception of the generality indicated by the Qur'anjc
verse, "Divorced wome11 re111ai11 l11 waiti11g [i.e., do not remarry] /Qr tnree
periods..." (Qur'an: Al -Baqa,rah: 228) According to the analogical deduction,
Che waiting period of the sla"e girt is hnlf that of tbe freewoman" Le,. one and
half me.nstruol periods. Yet, as lbe menstrual period cannot be divided, thus
the waiting period of the sla"e girl ls t\Vo menstrual periods,
As for the divorced wom,111 lvho does not have a ,monthly mensfrua!_perjod
due to menopause or roung age. her waiting period is three momhs. This is
according lo the noble verse, •~nd those wl,o no lo11ger expect 111e1istruation
amongyourwomeh - ifyo11 .,loubt, then their period i.s tllree month,, and {also
for] tl,ose who /,ave not me11i!trnate.d..." (Qur'an: A!-Talaq: 4)

With regard to this, Jmam. M11waf:faq11d-.Dl11 lbn Qudiinaf, and other
gcbola:rs stated that:

•lviwl/im sclwlnrs wwnimow;lyagree 1/111i tlte wai/i11gperiod prl!Scribed
for tl,e menopausal fir:ewomcm muf /(JI' lhc yot1ngfreewom1111, wl•IQ'
l1(1.! ,rot menstnwted yet. is 1
ihrec month;,">$
As for the woman who has Teat'hed lhe age of puberty but, ha~ not
menstruated yet, her waiting period l& tu be the same as the rneuopausal
womil'n, as she is included in the verse: "... and [also Jor]'tliose who have
r,ot menstruated..." (65: 4) When the nie110pausal divnreed slave woman
or that who has not menstruated is the mother of a child of her master,
her waiting period is two montths, for • Umnr (may Allah_ be p]ea$ed with_
him) said:

"The waiting period prescribed for the divorced slave girl who has
l1.egorte11 a child to her mru:ter is two menstrual periods, Ifslw has
0
not me1istruated, her waiti,•ig pe1iod is two mont/.is,"'
This is because the months substitute for the m~nsl rual periods. Some
sc!iol-Jt'S maintain that w!liting p,eriod of such a woman is only one and half
months, Thelr proof of this is that the waiti11g period prescribed for the slave
girl ls half that observed by the freewomon, ond the waiting period for the
freewoman who h.as not menstruated is three months; thus. the men.opausal
slave woman is one month and a holf.
Concerning the divorced woman who used to menstru.1te but suddenly
stops menstruating not because Qf old age, she has two cases:
The lint case is when she does nor know the c;iuse that prevents her
menstrual period, and h1!nce, she i.s 10 observe a wa:iting period of one
year: nine months for prep1ancy and three months for the waiting
period pr"6cribed for the menopausal womm Asb-Shatri (may
Allah have mercy on him) snid:
'"Tlits is the judgment of •Umar issued among the Mul11ijirun ,; and tlie
Arf,lJlr, and nor,e ofthem denied it. The reason bc/1/nd /egislati11g si,c7,

nine months pass, it becomes certain that she Is notpregnant. Tit en, s/,e
is to observe tire wiliting period prescribed for the menopausol woman,
i.e., three months. The ·loi:af waitingpe,-iod is thus twelv~ mo11ths, during
which it will be ~rt'11in t/i,~tshe i$ 11otpreg,,a11f and thatthe tliree 11wnlhs
supposed to be Jot mens11'1Jatitm have passed."

The second c:as.- is when such a woman knows the cause that prevents her
menstrual period, su.c h as illness, breastfeeding. or taking a medicine
that prevents !Jle.nstr11ati\)n. lo this case, she is to wait until tlie cause
110 longer eltists, and. then if she rnenstruates again, she ls to obserye
a wafting period of three menstrual periods. However, ifshe,does not
menstruate, she is lo observe a waiting period of one year jus.t as the
woman who does not know the cause dial prevents her menstrual
period, according to •the most rpreponderanl ,;,iew; - ~ is the \lPiniO!l
ofShaykhul-lslftm Iba Taymiyah and one Clftkt opinions related about
lmam A!unacL
There are some cases pertaining to the must11hi\i1ah 1\

the first case is when she knows her time and habit of menstrWltion
before lstihadah ''. Then, her waiting perjod must equalthreemenstruai
periods according to her usual pattern.
Tl\·e second case ls when she forgets the duration oJ her menstrual period
before the istib,,)dah, but she distinguishes her menstrual blood (.from
the blood of J$t.i/!4dal1}; thus, she must consider her menstruation
period relying on the distinction betwee.n the menstrual blood and
that of istih.adol,.

'Tbe third case is ._.hen sh~ forgets the time of her me.nstruatiO!l and
she cannot distinguish her menst.rual blood, then she is to observe
the same waiting peiriod o( a menopausa,l divorced woman, namely
three months.
One of the rulings pertaining to the·walting period is the marriage proposal
to a woman observing her w~iting period. It i~prohibited to propose frankly
to the widow or the lrrevocaoly divorced woman as long as any of th.em is
observing her wrutin,g period. flor e.xample, a man i~ prohibited to say to
such a woman something lik,e, "I want to marry you." Howeve,:,. he•can allude
concernin,g a proposal IO h.er, such as when he soys, •r want to marry someone
like you'; for Allah, Exalted be He, says, RTherc ts no 'blame upon you for that
to whitll you {indlrectlyj allude co,icer11i11g a proposal to women..." (2:: 235)
In addition-, it ·rs permiss:ible for the man to propose, whether frallkly or
indirectly, 10 his revocably divorced wjfe during or after her waiting period,
~ince he is permitted to take back his revocably divorced wife during her
waiting period or remarry her after her waiting period.

As for the wile of a missing man who 'has disappeared and it is not certain
that he is alive, she is to wait a 5uffidenl pedod, set by the Judge, for him to
come back or until something certain is known about him. During this period,
.she is still considered his wife. since th.e principle act!!cl upon in this case is
that he is considered alive. When this period expires, he is legally considered
a dead person, and his wife is to observe the waiting period prescribed in
case of death, which is four months and ten days. This is the judgment. the
Companions (IIllly Allah be plused wilb them all) gave in such a case, TmAm
lbnul-Qayyim said:

"... The Rightly-guided Caliphs gave judgments concetning t/te wife
of a missing man as narrated about 'Umar Ibnul-Khatl/lb. Imam
Ahmad Ib11 Htmbal said, 'I do not do11bt this ruling, for five of the
Companiom ordered the wife of the missing man to observe the
waiting period prescribed for Jhe widow.' ~m
Iml\m Ibnul-Q11syyim. added, "The opi11ion of· Umarls the most preponderant
view by meaus ofana/ogic(l/ dedr,ctiori, a,ul Sliaykfnil-JsltltH Ibn Taymiyah said,
'This 'is the s01.111de$t Q[liniau.'"'
When the waiting period of the wif:e of a missing man expires, ahe is
permitted to marry another man, and she does not need to get a divorce
from the guardian of her missing husband. If she remarc1es an.d lheo her first
husband returns, he has .the option to truce her b.tck or approve of her secoed
marriage and restore his dowry, according to Ure prepo0derant view, whether
Ills return is before or after ,t he oonsummallon of her m~e to ,the other
mari. Wrt'b regard to tfus, Shaykhu1-Itl.Am lb11 Taynify1ih (~ay Allah have

"T/te soundest ruling an /he wife ofa missing man is the judgment of
'Umar and sarne ot11er Companiot1s; she must waitJaw- years, then

Verifying the Slave Girl's
Non-1t>regnancy
Verifying that the slave girl :is not pregnant is achieved by her master
abstaining from having sexual intercourse with her for a specified period
sufficient to make sure that she has not conceived. Thus, when a slave girl 'is
sold, given as a gift or captured and she is fit to have sexual intercourse, her
new master is prohibited to have :;exual i.ntercourse with l\er or even foreplay
until making sure that she is not pregnant, for the Prophet (PBUH) said:
"Lt is not lawful for a man wlro believes in Allah and t/1e Last Day to
water what another lias sown (meaning having sexual intercourse
1
with a pregnant womar1)."
(Related by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and Abu D~wud)
In another narration related by AbO DlwOd, the Prophet (PBUH) said:
"No one should have sexua1 intercourse with a pregnant woman
(from a previous man) until she gives birth."'

VII: DIVORCE

480

The pefiod of verifying the pregnancy of a slave girl lasts until she gives
birth, due to the generality c,f the Qur'anic verse:

•~ ..And for those who ,are pregnant, their term is until th#y
give .birth ..."
(Qur'an: A1-Ialaq: 4)
The period of verifying 1the non-pregnancy of the non-pregnant slave girl
who menstruates is only one menstrual period, as the Prophet (PBUH) said
about the enslaved women c,f AwtAs':

"No one should have sexual intercourse with a pregnant woman
(from a previo11s man) until she gives birtfr. nor should anyone have
sexual intercours.e IVitli a non-pregnant woman until ·a menstrual
period passes."
(neJated by Ahmad and Ab() Daw'\id)
This badM1 indicates the obligation of verifying if the slave girl is pregnant
or not, whether c-1pruted 01r 1101, before having sexual intercours.e with her.
Moreover, this 11.adfth illustrates how to verify the pregnancy of the pregnant
slave gitl and tbat of the menstruating one.

As for the menopausal slave girl or one who is still young alld has not
menstruated yet, she needs one ll)onth to verify her pregnancy, since one
month sribstihltes for one menstrual period in countjng the waiting period.
• The wisdom -behind the: prescription of verifying the ptegl)aucy or the

non:pregi,ancy of the slave J~I is implied in the b,adfth in which 'the Prophet
.(PBU'Hf.sa~
•1t1s-n'ot 1?,wfalfl)t a m.lltJ who believes in Allah and the L:ast Day to
W4(er what another h~I§ sown (meaning hpvirig sexual intercourse
with a pregnant woman).''
Thls ini!kates that the objective of verifying the pre_gnl!Jlcy is to avoid any
possible confusion concernilng the lineage.of the offspring.

Breastfeeding

Allah, Exalted be He, says concerning women one is forbidden to marry
(temporarily or perpetually):

"... your [milk] mothers 1who nursed yo11, your sisters through
nursing..."
(Qur'an: An-Nis:i': 23)
This is also demonstrated in the Prophetic b.adiths as it is related in the two
authentic books of Al-Bukhari an,d Muslim that the Prophet (PBUH) said:

~II things which become unlawful because of blood relations
are unlawful because of the corresponding foster breastfeeding
relations."
He (PBUH) also said in a l.!adith related by the Group of Compilers of l:ladith:

"What is unlawful because of blood relations is also unlawful
because of the corresponding foster breastfeeding relations."'

Ylli BREASTFEEDING

Linguistically, breastfeeding re.fen; to sucking milk al the breast or drinking
it (whe.n milked in a container). Jurisprudentially, the term refers to sucking
lllilk at the breast oc drinking it in aoothet· way by a child less than two years
of age provided that the milk results from pregnancy.
As for the rulings on foster breastfeeding relations, they are treated like
blood relations in marital affnirs, being a.lone with a woman, being a maJ.1ru1n
fa woman's husb~nd or any l,lllIIlarriageablekin of hers) and the permissibility
of exchanging looks, which will be demonstrated in detail later, if Allah wills.
However, there·are two cooditions the fµJfilling of which renders the r11li11gs
on blood rel'1tions applicable to foster breastfeeding.relations:

The.first condition: The nursed baby mu.st have five suds or more, for
•A'Jshah (may ADah be pleased with her) narrated:

"It had been revealed in the Glorious Quri111 tf,at teh plet1r s11dcs make
the marriage 1mlawfid. then it was abrogated (and s11bstituted) by
five sucks andAllal{s A1emmger (PBUH) .died while it (i.e. the verse
indicating five sucks) was still recited as-a verse of the Quran (for
some Muslims were w,aware tht1t it 1Yas,also abrogated.)"'
(Related by Imam Mu~lim)
The abrogation here is applicable only 10 the recitation and not to the
juristic ruling. This narmtion gives more elaboration to !he genera'.! meaning
of the a\>ove-mentioned verse and fJadith as far a.~ nursing is concerned.

The second condition is that the nursed baby i's to be breastfed five
sucks (or more) during the nursing perioi;I which is two years, for Allah,
Eli;alte,;l be He, says:

nMother, may nurse {i.e., bre1JStfeed/ theirclii4/.ttn two complete
years for whoever wisl1es to co111plete the nursing [period],.."
(Qur'a.n: Al-Baq.uah: 233)
This verse signifies that 'the breastfeeding meant here is the one which
takes pface during the two years of nursing. This is also asserted in a hadlth in
which the Prophet (PBUH) sayst

"The only breastfeeding which makes marriage u11lawf11I is that
which is taken from the breast and enters the aowels, and is taken
before the time ofwea11i11g."'
At-Tirmidh1 says, "This is a b.asa11 (good) iOl!ih (authentic) b.adith."This
hodftl, means that the nursing which prohlbiti; marriage is that which the

Cbi,pror l : Btcostfu:ding

nursed baby gers into his bowels in a way that nurtures him and makes pis
bowels grow and enlarge. Thus, the little lnsigtulicant nursing that does not
enter the bowels of the nursed baby nor render them wide does not prohibit
marriage. Besides, the nursing which prohibits marriage and to which the
rulings on blood relationships are applied is that which takes place before the
weaning. That is to say, the prohibiting 11\II'Sing (prohibiting marriage and
other affairs) is the one oa:urring while the nursed baby is still taking his
nourishment only by breastfeeding; only !Dillewbicb makes his flesh grow and
tbus becomes a part of him (in the fonnof flesh and bones).
It is con.sitlered a suck when the nursed baby starts sucking milk'at the-breast
then stops for breathing or suckfng another breast or for another reason . If he
returns to the same breast afresh afier that pause, it is considered two sucks even
if this occurs at one time. This is because the Lawgiver has defined a certain
number for the prohibiting nursing and not the way of nursing itself. II is rathec
determJned to be a suck according to the commonly acknowledged customs.

If the milk enters the abdomen of the nursed baby without being sucked,
by way of letting it fall in drops into his mouth or nose or by drinking it
from a container and the like, it is then treated as being sucked at the breast
as fur the Juristic ruling is concerned. This is because'the nur~ed baby takes
nourishment from it that way the same as done in br!!astfeedipg, provided
,t hat he i;ucks'five times.
As foe prohibited,things due l'o nu.tsiJW,tbe mused b,iby is,considered as the

Thus, it is allowed for the foster-son to look at his foster-mother and be
alooe with he,c. However, the foster soil ls not regarded as the 'SOD of the 1vet
nurse r ~diilg the other rulings: he ls uot obliged 'to provide her su.1tenance,
they are not entitled to inherit each other, he is not to pay the blood-money
on 'h ,r behalf if she kills or injures some ~rson, and he is not empowered to
act_as her legalguardian. This is because blood relation.ships are stronger than
thl\t resttlting from nursing. Yet, both relationships are not to be treated alike
as far as juristic rulings are concerned except in matters stated in a Qur'a.nic or
a Prophetic text, such as being prohibited ·to one's fosteromother in marriage,
being lawful to look at each other and bei-ng alone with each other.

VIII BllF.ASTl'EEDING

'fhe nursed baby is regarded u the son ofthe man to whom the. milk of
the fosfer-JDother is ascribed to.l:lave been caused by rum byway of pregnancy
or sexual intercourse throuigb mauiage or {he like, since her pregnancy is
ascribed to him and nursinJ~ is one of its results. Thereby, the nursed baby is
regarded as the son of the foster-father, and the same tullngs that concern
tbe foster-mother apply to the foster-father. That is, it is prohibited for the
foster-father to marry his foster-daughter, yet His permissible to look at her,
be alone with her nod be hetr 11ml!ro:n.r. but she is .not regarded as his gaughter
in other rulings.
Besides, all the mahra ms of the foster-father - his fathers, children,
mothen;, grandfathers, grandmothers, brothers and ;isters and their children,
his paternal uncles, his patemal-a1.Lnts, hu; rn;iternal uncles and maternal aunts
- ;are ri1(1h,11ms for the nl.Ltsed baby. Likewise, all the mahrams of the fostermother- her fathers, childrnn, mothers, sisters, maternal aunts, paternal ~unts
and the like are his inahrmns.
Since nursing m-akes ii prohibited for the foster-father (or mother) to
roar(y the nursed person, beside t'he rulings on marital affairs, all of these
rtibngs apply to the childre•n of the foster child, his .gr,1ndchildren, but 1101
10 his fathers, mot.hers, pawrnal uncles, paternal dunts:, maternal uncles and
maternal aunts nor to his brothers and sisters.
Il' a baby breast feeds at the breast of a woman who is married through ,m
l nva)Td marriage contract or a woman who has committed adultery, he is to
be ascribed only (as a foster-child) to the foster-mother, slnce his paternity !las
not been established from family relationship (his father is unidentified). As
paternity i~ not e5tablished thrm.1gh a blood relation, ir IS not established from
nursing, for nursing is a bratnch of paternity.
lf two children (a mal'e and a female) have brea.<tfed from the milk of a
milch animal, this is not a p 1ohibiting nursing.
Scholars disagree as to t:he c.~se of the child being nursed from a woman
who may breastfeed witho1.Lt being pregnant or having sexual intercourse,
wKether this nursing is a pmhlbiting one or not. Some scholars maintain that
ii i5 not a prohibiting nursimg, since her milk is, not a real one (uo1 resulting
from having ~aual inttlrcourse), but .rather a biological, unnatural one.
BeSides, real. milk is t'h e on,e sucked from a fem-ale breast making the bones
and the flesh of the nursed t,aby grow, while this milk does not do this. Other
scholars, such as Al-Muwalffaq and others, are of the view that this musing
js a prohibiting one.

_Breastfeeding is confim1ed by a t<1stlrnony of an upright woman. In this

If the nursing is not confirmed, or the sucks are doubted to be five or less
and there is no evidence proving. the coottary, then the.re is no prohibiti.QJl.

T.l\is is because the orfginal ruling is lhnt there is no nursing. And, Allnh,

C:ustody

Jurisprudentially, custody is the protection of a child or a mentally ill adult
and the like, preventing any harm from befalling him, bringing him up through
seeing to his physical and moral needs.
The wisdom behind custody is manifest; the child and those of his case
(lacking discernment, such as the insane and the lunatic person) are unable
to manage their own interests. Therefore, they need a guardian to take care of
them by protecting them from any harm, bringing about whatever is useful for
them and bringing them up in the proper way.
The Shari'ah (Islamic Law) has decreed custody, and it is in fact a divine
mercy through which the affairs ,of the wards are conducted, a way to do them
the power of good. If the wards are left without being taken care of, they will
be lost. As lslam is the religion of mercy, solidarity, and consolation, it enjoins
Muslims to show mercy to them, take care of them and solace them. Islam also
forbids Muslims from leaving such persons without a guardian and makes it

490

Vlll BREASTFEEDING

obligatory upon Muslims to provide for them. Moreover, it is a right of the
wardrobe cared for by his rd'atives, and it is at fh.e same time a duty upon the
guardian to toke care of him asjn the case of guardianships.

Custody is Obligatory upon Guardians in the Following Order
The per6on most entitled lo have the custody of a child is the mother: 4i
this concern, ltnim Muwaftlaqud, Dill lbn Qudamah (may Allah have mercy
on him) says;

"{f the Jwsbanil and t711e wife are legally separoted and they have
q c/tild (ward or lnsru1e whether male or female), his/her mother
/ms the best rfght .to ,have custody, if she f111fills tire conditions
11ecessaryfor the pers1m to have custody over a d1i/d. Tltis is the view
maintained by lmiim l\1iilik and the scholars known for personnl
interpretative j11dgmentl, and it has not come to mJ knqw/edge l/1111
tlrerc is a contmry opin.fo11."
A woman has no right of the cusr.ody (of her child from a previous
marriage) when she marries (another person), and tl1e child's custody in such
a case atilomatically devolv~; to the nex,t most eligible persoa. This is because
once a woman ,came to the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) ,md said:
"O Mes.senger of A)la.h! My womb was a ,1essel to this son pf

111ine, my bre11Sts were· a means of quenching his lhirst, and my
lap was a plaoe. ofprotection for liim. Yet, his fatlrer has ilivorced
me, and wmtts to take him away from me.• The Prophet (PBUH)
said, "You h,we more rig/it to him as long as ycu tio not ma">'
1
(anotherpcrso,1)."
(Related by lm~m Ahm,ad, Abo DawOd, and Al-Hakim who deems
11 a iahlb (authentic) b.iidith)
The b.adlth signifies that the mother has the t,esr right to have custod5' of
ihe child if her husband (the (:hild's father) divorces her and wishes ro have him
under bis custody. It also signifies that if the mother marries another person,
she is no more entitle~ to be ,the child's guardian.
The mother takes precedcmce in having the child in her custody since she ls
tenderer toward the child than his closest relative. None shares her closeness of
blood relationship except the chUd's father, yet his ,tenderness is !es.~ than hers.
In case t he child's father is entitled to hove custody -over the child, he would
let his preseot wifo take care ,llf him.. The child's mother has the best right than

Chapter 2: Cusiody

the husbands wife to have the child unc!e.r her custody. ln th is cor1Lwctio11, ib11.
' Abbas ( may Allah be pleased with him) once -said to a man:

'"Her (the-mother~) smell, bed and lap are betterfm· your smi until
he reaches the age ofdiscrnfiot1 a11d is gi-ven,cltoice as to whit.Ir ofhis
parents he wants to stay with;"'
•
Jn thrs regard, Shaykhul-bli\m Ibn 1'.iym1yah :Says:
'''l'/ie mother has more right io have custody over lter child rhmi tltc

than anyone else. There/ere. she is specifically desig1rated. aGcordnrg to
1
Shari 'ah, to have custody over l1«r 11111/is,·riminuting child."
However, when a mother's right to the custody of her ·c hild is lost, it devolves
to her moi-ber (the- child's maternal grandmothers ill asce11di11g iineage)
according to their closeness to the child, 'l"his is bec;iase they are regarded as
the child's mother, for they are the persons who have begot the childs mother,
and whose mercy to the ward is more ensured than other~.
Them the father, to whom the child~ eicistence is ascribed, is giveo _precedence over nther relatives concerning the custody of his ch ild (after the child's
maternal grandmothers), for· he is closer and more loving to him than others.
A.fter that, the rjgbt o( the custody of the child devolves to the paternal
grandmothers for thd)' ~re atilong the child's agnate relatives. They are
prefetred to grandfathers, for when there are some pernons with the ,same
degree of relation to the child, the w<lman 'is more entitled to take precedence,
for she is closer to the child. This is the same as in rhe case of rhe father and
the motbec.
The rigl\1 of custody devolves t·hen lo the child's paternal grandfathers, ac.•
cording lo iheir closeness to the chlld, for they are regnriled as the ward's father.
Then, the·rlgbt of custody devolves 10 mother1, of grandfathers (mother of
the maternal grandfather then mother of the paternal grandfather), for they
relate to the ward by l\is/het grand far her and they have begotten the ward's
grandfather. Thus, the ward tsregardedas partofrheir lineage.
After that, the wa.rd's sisters have the right of the custody of the ward,
for th,ry relate to nim/her by both or either parents, So, the full sister is
given precedence 011et half sisters, for she has priority•in inheritance. '\ne

she relates to hi's/fter mother who is given precedence ov,er the father .as far
as !he right of custody is concerned; then the halJ paternal sister, However,
some scholars maintain a reasonabl_e opinion that the half paternal sister
takes precedence over the maternal one, for the posilion of authority is for
the father's side. They also say that the paternal father is more entitled to
Inheritance than the mater.nalsi'ster; since she "is regarded as a full sister in
case the full sister is absent.
'rhe right of custody then devolves to maternal aunts for their relation to
the ward's mother. fn this regard, ii is nanated in the Two Authentic Books of
Al Bukhari and Muslim that the Prophet (PJRM) said':
0

"The matemal aunris qf the same status as the mother.''J
However, the mother's full sister takes precedence, then the ltlother's
maternal sister, then the mother's paternal sister, as fn the sisters' case.
The paternal aunts then have the right of custody for their relation to the
ward's father, who comes after tl1e mother as far as the right of custody is
concerned. Ip this regard, Shaykhul-lslilm lbn Tayrniyah (1J;1ay Allah have
mercy on him) says;
"Tire paternal aunt is 111ore entitled to the rig/it of the rustody of the

Causes Pre1venting Custody
The right of custody may be raken away due to the following reasons:
Slavery: A slave is not allowed to h,we the custody of a ward, for custody is
a position of authority ttl whkh a :,lave is oot entitled. This is because a slave is
always busy serving his master and totally devoted to his benefits.
Disobedience: A defiant!)• d isobe<lienl person is not entrusted co the
custody of a ward for fear that he may render harm to the ward by badly raising
him/her according io the same evil manners.

Likewise, a disbeliever is not. entitled to take a ward in custody, for he
causes much harm to the ward by tuniing him/her away from Islam by raising
him/her according to the teachings and manners of disbelief.
Moreover, the woman who is married to someone who is not among the
agnate relatives of the W"Jrd is not entitled to take the custody of the ward. This
is because the Prophet (PBUH) 01:1ce said to a child's mother:
"You have more right to him as long as you ,fo not mt1rry."

496

vm BREASTFEEDING

This Is because she is entirely devoted to he1· husband who has the r1ght
to prevent her from looking after the ward. Thus, if the woman is married
to someone from amongst ber ward's relntlves, she still has the right to 1he
cLL~tody of the ward.
However, i£ the aforementioned causes are eliminated, those who are
prevented from having custody of a ward may tnke this right. To e.laborate, if
the slave is set free, the disobedient person repents, the disbeliever embraces
ls.lam or the remmied woman is divorced, then•either of them will. be entitled
to take the custody of the ward. This is because there is no cause preventing
raking it in such cases.
If one of the parents of the ward wishes to travel a long journey in order to
stay in n distant place, intending no harm to the other party, then the father is
more entitled to take the custody of the child. It does not mnke any difference
whether the father is the one traveling or the one staying behind in the
homeland. lt is also stipulated that the way and the place this one is traveling
to be safe. This ls because tp e father is thei one who undena.kes disciplining
and protecting him/her as best 11s possible. So, if the father were to be away
from his child, he would aot be able lo undertake rhis duty alld thus rhe child
would be <lost.
On the contrary; the mother is more entitled to the custody of her child
if ~ith-cr ofthe parents travels to live in a near place, the distance of which 1s
less than that of shortening prayer. It does not make any difference whethe.r
the mother is the one traveling or tbe one stayi:nghehiod. This is because sbe
ls more merciful to the ward and in such a case the ward's father c.1.1) look
after him/her.
However, if the travel was for a certain purpose after fulfilling whicli the
on~ tr:1veling will return, then the ward is to be kept Jn the custody of the one
staying behind of either of the parents. This also is to be applied in case the
place of travel or the way is perilous. This is because taki'ng the ward along
in such cases may cause harm lo him/her. With regard to this, linam lbnul-·
Qayylm (may Allah have mercy on him} said:

"It is a h·ick contradicting what the Lawgiver Intends t/1at a father
intentiortally travels to take his child away from his/her mother to
deprive herfrom tlte right of the chiIds custody. The Lawgiver decreed
/hat the mother is more entitled to•liave: the .ic<tody of her child thll:h
the father in case they live near each other 1md it is pos$i/,le for them
(lhe fathet and th~ c!iild) to meet at any time, ..» '

.Cbapccc :¼, Causes Preventing Custody

lbriul"Qayyim !hen added:
•the- Prophet (PBUH) said that 1vhoever separate$ a mother and
her child, Allah will separate him Jrom his beloved persons on
the Day of Resurrectio11. Moreo,1er, the Prophet (PBUH) forbade
selling a..sltive woman alone without her r.hild or vice versa, eve11
if they are botlr in the same town. Thus, it is more deserving to
be forbidden that a father makes a trick tn separate between a
mother- and her cTtild in s1-1ch a way thnt it becomes l1t1rd far the
mother to see, meet and bear- the absence of iier ,hi/ti. This is too
hard for her; thus, the judgme11t of Al/air and His Messenger is
the worthiest to be followed: the mother is more entitled to have
the custody of the chit.>/, whether- the father Ctavels or stays at
horue. To illustrate, the Prophet (PBUM) said to a wom,:m, 'Yott
hav,; '710re right to· him as long as you do not marry: Therefore,
how is ft reasonable to say that the mother is more entitled to
ha11e the custody Qf lier child as long as /he child's father doe.1 1,ot
travelr Surely, this view is not supporte,J by any evidence from
the Glorious Qttrt!ln, the Sunnah (Trru#tion) oflhe Messenger of
Allah (PBUH), the fatwas ' of tl,e Prophet~ Companion or the
authentic analogical deduction.''

The Child's Right to Choose between His/Her Parents
' Umar and 'Ail (may Allah he pleased \<~th the.m both) decreed that a
child, at the age ofseven and being sane, can cl\oose to stay with either parents.
This view is asserted by the l!adith related by At• Tll'midhr and other compliers.
on .the authority of Abu Hurayrah who narrated:

•A woma11ca1t1eto the Prophet(PBUH)andsaid, 'Myhusba11dwa11ts
to take away Ill)' son (after di11on:i11g me).'The Prophet (PBUH) said
to the child, 'This is your father a11d //,is is your mother.; so t/lke the
hand ofany of them whom you like most.' The boy took his mother's
hand and she ive111 away with him."'

The aforesaid haditlr signifies that a child, if ahie to discern, is to be giye,1
the choice to stay wid1 either parent (in case of di¥orce) . When o child reaches
the age of discrimination and leans to either parent, lhis :means that the one
chosen 1s more merciful to the child than the other. 'l'he child is 011.ly given
such a choice when two conditions·are fulfilled:

Vlll BR.E.AS'fPEE:DING

498

First: Both parents must be entitled to have 'the custody of the child.
Second: The child mu.st be sane and if not so, s/he is to stay wlth the
mother who is !DOre merciful to him/her and knows better about liis/
her iolere~ts.

If a sane chi.Id chooses the father (as guardian), s/he stays with him
day and night, to protect, insh'uct and educate him/her. However. a
fathev is not allowed to prevent rbe <:flild frorn Visiting bis/her moibet,
for this may render the child undutiful and make him/her sever ties of
relationship. lf a child choo.~es the mother, s/he is to ~pend the night
wtth her and the day with his/ber father in .order to educate him/her;
If a child chooses neither of the parents, then lots are to be drawn in
order to see who receives the custody of him/her, as this is the only
way to prefer one to the other.
'T'he father is more entitled to have the custody of his daughter once she ls
seven, for he is more able to protect' her and has more eight than anyone else
to be her guardian and this is to continue until she is married. However, the
mother is to be permitted to visit her daughter in case no evil might happen'.
If the father is :not able to protect his daughter or that he neglects her due to
his being busy oc impim1s, while her mother is apt to preserve her well, then
the daughter is to stay with her mother.

Shaylchul-Islam lbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) says:

•1111am A!Imad mid his followers give the fath er prtcedence over the·
mother with regard Iv the custody of their da11ghter in case !lµs does

of the same quality as that of other similar women, comes at the top of one's
duties toward her. For Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"Let a man of wealth spend from his wealth ..."
(Qur'an: A.t-Ia!Aq: 7)
And He also says:

•~ .. And due to them {i.e., the wives] is similar to what is expected
of them, according to what i., reasonable..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 228)

Moreover, 1he Pmphtt (PBUH) said:

'''Their rights upon you are tJ14t you should provide them wit/1
p,ovisio11 and clothing in a reas(mable manner."'
(Related by hn!m Muslim and Abu DAwCtd)

Sbaykh11"1sHm Ibo 1aymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

When there is a dispute between the two spouses, rhe judge estimates the
amount of the wife's alimony according to the floancial level of them both,
whether lhcy both nre rich or only one of them is rich. Thus, a wi:11-off wife
who is married to a well-offhusbru1d is entitled to have a sufficient amount of
provision of the same quality as that of slmilnr women in that town; the same
is true for clo1hlng ancl furni1ure. Lil,ewise. a poor wife with a poor husband is
entitled' to.have a sufficient amount of food., clothing and furniture of the same
quality as that of similai· women. However, the wife of the middle class with a
similar husband (of the same conditions), 1! well-off wife with a poor husband,
and a poor wife "~th a well-offhusband~are entitled to have the maintenance
ofth~ average level, according to the known wstoms. Moreover, lhe husband
ls to provide for what his wife needs such as water fot personal cleanliness,
drinkJng and purification, etc. However, the husband is not 10 provide the
aforementioned needs if they are no lo1.1ger married. Once a wife is divorced
and becomes in her w~iling period, the following cases are to be observed:
A revucably divorced womtm is entitled to be maintained by her husband

as long as $he is in her waitlng perlod, as she is regarded as a wife. This Is
because Allah, Exalted be He, says:

": .. A11d tlieir hr,sba11ds Juwe mare r.igl,r to take them btUk m
this [period/ ..."
(Qur'an; Al-8.iqarah: 228)
A major or minor irrevocably divorced woma.11 is not entit'led to any
financial support or housing by her husband. This is based on the !lad/th
narrnted in the Two Authentic Books of AI-Buk.hari"and Muslim that when
the husband of Fatimah Bini Qays (may Allah be pleased with her) irrevocably
divorced her, the Prophet (PBUH) >"llid lo her:
"There is neither a/itnon,1 nor ladgi11gfor yoa.•'

However, ;i pregnant irrevocably divorced woman is entitled to alimony.
for Allah, Exalted be He, says:

(Qur'an: A!·Ialaq: 6)
Moreover. the Prophet (PBUF-f) said to fa!imah Bi11t Qays:
"Tliere is 110 alimony for yot1 except ifyou are pregnant.";,

Th1s is because sioce tl1e husband is the father of lhe unborn child , Ile
\hen !~ to finandally 5upport it .i,nd this can11ot be achieved ,except tnroug'1
maintailling the mother. Conce:rning this view, Al-.Muwaffaq and other
scholars commented saying:
"This opinitm is Wlfl!limo11sly agreed 11po1l by all sc/to/Qrs, However,
they ente,taii1ed different views co11cerni11g whether alimony is puid
for/he fetus ftse/f orfor tire woman fariheJsc1ke Qjthe fetus? "

With this in m ind, the issues involved in tli.e aforesaid two opin.ions are
summarized in numerous rt11ing:$ explained in books of jurisprudence and
legal rulings.
'
A wife is not entilled to main,teriancc: by het' husband for several reasons
as follows,
When the wife keeps herselfa~~ay from her husband, then she is riot entitled
to bt: maintained by her husband , th.is is because, in such a case. he does nol
sexually enJoy her and,he is to m,iintain her in return for enjoying he"
The same, is true when a wife shows disobedience to her husband, i.e.
disobeys.her husband ln doi11g ber marital duties, such as refusing to allow
him to bavesex1111l intercourse wit:h her, refusing to move tn to anotller 5uitable

house, or leaving his house withou( his permission. In such case.~, the wife i~
considered disobedient,, as he cannot enjoy her. Thus, she is not entitl~d to
receive her:alimony. for, as mentioned before, he is to maintain her In retUtn
for enjoying het,
Furthermore, when thE: wife keeps herself away from her husband by·
traveling for some purpose , then she has no right to be maintained by her
h11sband, for, in such a case, he cannot enjoy her,
Moreover, -a widow is to be prov1ded for by herself or whoever is responsible
for her 1hhe is poor. This ls because she ib not entitled to have the alimony,out
of her husband's estate, whii:h belongs then to hi~ heirs,

A pregnant widow is entitled to be maintained from the estate of her
husband, if he has left any. due to the existence of the fetus; if tl\e deceased
husband h3li left nothing, thte well-off among the tetus' legal heirs ,( in case the
fetus dies) is to maintain thi~ mother.
It is permissible that the two spouses agree that the maintenance be afforded
in advance or be delayed ei·ther for a l'ong or a short time; they have the full
right to do so. if tl\ey disagnie. (concerning whom to pay the maintenance), the
husband is to pay the mai1m:11ancea1 the beginning of the day. It is pemiissible
to pay it in grain, if they agree lo do so, but ~s it requires a great deal pf effort,
she has the right to accept or refuse th.~ maintenance in.grain,
Likewise, the husband is ro provide his wife With the 'llllilual clothing at
the beginning of every year. If the h1;1sband is absent aad has not left the us,ual
maiJ]tenance for his wife or if he is present but has not g-iven the maintenance
to her, then he sill! has to ·give the previous delayed maintenance, for it fa still
her tight which th~ husban,d must give in ea~e or hardships, This right does
not become invalid with the passage of time.
The husband is to 5lart maintaining his wife once sl\e allows him toenjoy
her In the marital life. Ifhe ii, unable to financially support her, it is permissible
for het to _nullify the martiage contract. This is based on the bµd/th Abtl
Hurayra~ (may Allah 'be ple,ased with him) narrated thaf the Prophet (PBUH)
said concerning a man who canriot fi11ancially support his wife:

"They are to be 5eparated (by divorce).~'
(Related by Ad-Daraq111:niJ
Tl\is is also asserted by r,he foUowing verse as Allah, the Almighty, says,
"... Then/after that), either keep [/,et] 111 an acaptable ma1111eror
release [lu,r] with good treatm•711,.-" (Qur'an: AI-Baq_arah: 229)

Cb.iptct 4: TheWifes Allmony

505

Undoubtedly, keeping a Wife without financially supporting her Is nor an
acceptable manner.

If a well-off husband is absent without leaving 5ufficient c:xpenditure to
hls wife and she cannot take it from his estate or borrow it to his debit, then
she has tbe right to nullify the marriage contract by the permission of the
judge. If she ls able to talie from \tis estate, she is allowed to take the amount
that suffices her. The evidence of this is shown in the badith related in the
<Two Authentit·Books of Al-Bukhari and Muslim than~hen Hind Bini • Utbah
wld the Prophet (PBUH) that het husband (Abu Sufyan} does not give her
sufficient money, he (PBUH) said to her:
"Take what is sufficienrfor you arid your children, a11d I/le amou1tr
should be just and reasonable."

1n view of the aforementioned Opinions, we re-alize how perfect the
Shari'a/, (islnmic Law) is in rendering every r1ght to him who is entitl~d
to it. This is in fact the case i'n all its wise legi~lations. Shame on those Who

Maintaining Relatives and
Possessions

One's dose relatives here refer to those who are entitled to inherit from
one either by virtue of the prescribed shares or by being an agnate relative.
Possessio.ns refer to those who are under one's possession, slaves or animals.
When one's relatives are descending from the two origins oflineage, i.e.,
parents and grandparents of the maintainer no matter how high they are in
ascending lineage, or children no matter how low they are in a descending
lineage, then it is obligatory to maintain them, pmvided that t he following
conditions are fulfilled:
❖

The maintained persons must be poor who possess nothing, or possess
insufficient provisions, while being unable to earn their Jiving.

❖

Moreover, the maintainer musr be well-off who possesses abundant
provision for himself, his wife and his slaves (if any) .

❖ The maintainer and the maintained persons m ·Ust be of the

same religion.
❖ lf the maintained person(s) Is nor among the malntal:tier's forefathers

or offspring, then it is stipulated. in addition to the above-mentioned
conditions, that I he maintainer must ]>e ,entifled lo lnherit from the
maintained one.
One must maintain ooe's parent5 aa:ording to what Allah, E.xalted be
He, s~ys:

"...and to pare11ts do gootf. .!'

(Qur'An: Al-Baqarah: 83)

Neediess to say that main !!lining one's ·parents is one of the best way~ lo do
good to them.
The evidence that the fat:her must maintain his children is shown in the
nobk verse as Allah. the Alm.lghty, says:

•~ .. Upo11 the father .is their [i.e., the mothers'} provisio11 and
their clothing accord,i11g to wh111 is 11cctptable..."

The noble verse states th11t the father is to provide his wife with provision
a nd clothing in an acceptable manner as followed with sim11ar women in
their- town. fo accordance with the husband's financial conditions with !JG
squandering or rugg~rdliness. ',\'ith regard to this, lhe Prophet (PBUH) said:

"T,a~ what is s1ifjicie11~/or you and your d1Ndrttt, and the amou,,t

Exalted be He, says:

•~ .. And upon the {f,ith11t's) heir is [a 41,ty] /ike that [of the

1:hi.s is because the kinshi;p between tlie inheritor and the inherited person
necessitates that the heir is the most entitled person to the inheritors estate than
any one else. Thus, the ioheritl!d person is more entitled to be maintained by the
inheritor not by those Svho are not enllrled to Inherit him (the inherited persoo).

Allah, Exalted be He, meilJls that the one who ls entitled to 1111,erit ;t e.hild
(in case this child dies) is to maintain this child the, same. way as tile child'sfather would do. Moreover; Allah, the Almighty, says:

«...And gfye the re/atiYe his right...~

(Q11r'an: Al-Isra': 26)

There are many other evidences signifying that the affluent ,person is to
maintain his needy relatives. In !his eonnection, AbQ Dawud related:

•~ man asked the Prophet (PBUH). 'O Messenger of Allah! To
whom should J show kindness?' The Propher (PBUH) said, 'Your
mother, your father, your sister and your brother.' ·•1
ltis also related lly An-Nasa'i, on the authority ofDriq.AI-Muhilrib1, and

This badi.th explahl$ the noble verse that state"'
•: .. And give the relative his right..."

(Qur'an: Al-lsra': 26)

The father solely is to fully mai'ntain his children, for tlte. Prophet (PBUH}
ssld to Hind 'Bint ·utbah when she compiained of her mi~erly hu~band:

"Take what is st1Jficient for you and your children, and the amotmt
s/iould be just and reasonable."
•
This noble badith signifies that.the father solely is to maintain hls chtldren,
a ruling that i.s asserted by the noble verse:
"... upon tl,efather is their (I.e., tire mothers'/ provision .and theiJ:,
clothing accoriling to wlu1t ls a«eptable. .."
(Qur'An: Al-Baqarah: 233)

A11d the noble verse:
« ...

This implies that the father is the one who must maintain the breastfeeding
baby, not the mother:

lance from him. This is because Allah, Ex~lted be He, has related the inalntenance to the inheritance as io the noble verse:
",., /\111I 11pon I/it [fl1llitr's/ /reir is [a /luty] likthat{oft/,efatl,erj ...»

(Qur':in: AI-Baqarah, 233)
Thus, the amount of m1iintenance is to he proportional to that of the
Inherited est.i.te. Hence, who(:ver h.is a rich b>Tandmother and a full brother, the
formeristo undertake one-i;i,ct11 of his {the inherited person's) maintenance
while the rest ls to be updert.ak~n by the litter, ilS they inherit him acc;ording
to the same shares, and so oni.
A~ for the maintenance c,f slaves and animals, their lTll!Ster is !o maintain
his 8laves in terms of food, dothlng, and housing in an acceptable manner.
This is based on the fladilh in which the Prophet (PBUH) sa)'S:
«If is essential to feed l"1e slave, clotf1e him (properly) u11d not to

bu,-de11 him with work which fs beyor1d liis power."

(Related by Asb-ShMi 't In hi6 M11s11ad (Collection of Ascribed
Hadit/1s))
It is related in lhe two aullil~nrlcbooks of Al-Bukhari and.Muslim that Abu
Obarr (may Allah be pleased. with him) oarrat<.'ld:
"TheProphei-(PBUH) s,aid, ' four slaves areyolJl· brothers (i11 Islam)

brother tinder his tomrmmd s/1ouldfeed him of wltat fie cats and

This i;; also asserted in th,t noble verse a~ AUah, the Almighty, says:
".,, We certat11ly k11,ow wlrat We have made fire obligatory
upn11 them co.ncerui,ng tlteir wive• and tl1os• tl1elr right hands

(Qut'an: AI-Ahz~b: 50)

These texts signify that the slaves' maintenance is obligatory upon
their m;.tSters.

If a male .slave asks permission for marriage, his master must eitl\er get
him J)larried or sold, for Allaih., Ex,1lted be He. &Dys:

The imperative. statement in the aforementioned verse implies obligadon
When requested by the concerned. p~rson. Likewise, if the Same is asked by a
female slave, lier master is given a choice as to have sexual intercourse with
her; get her married or sell her to !relieve her of ~!lY harm.
Whoever owns an animal is to feed it, provide it with water, and do whar is
good for it, for the Prophet (PBUHJ s.ays:

"A woman was punished becm1se of a cat which she had imprisor1ed
until it died out ofhunger. She neither gave it food 11or water; nor

set it free to eat.from the venm/11 oftlie earth."''
(Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
This l:J.adith signifies that one· Is to maintain one's animals, for the said
woman was admitted to ffellfi.re due to le;1viog the cat unfed.or maintained. If
this is the case with a cat, then other possessed animals are more entitled to be
fed and maintained.
Furthermore; it is impermissible for th~ owner of an animal to overburden
it, or ro milk it in a Way that hami.s its offspring. The Prophet {PBUH) says:
"One should not liarm otl1ers 1101' should one seek b~nefitfor hiir1self

Moreover, it is prohibiti"d fo,tihe ow11er-,1f an ,mlmal to cun;e; hit or brand
it on the face. 1f the allitoru's owne:r is unable to maintain it, he i& to be forced
(by the judge) to have it sold, hiired out or slaughtered, if it is lawful to be

eliminated. And Allah, Exalted be He, knows- bes!.

Murder and its Types

Faqihs define crime as one's transgression against another's body, property,
or ho.nor. They have specified "the Book on Crimes" for the rulings on the
first kind, which is transgression against someone's body, and "the Book on
Penalties" for the second and the third ones, namely transgression against
someone's property and that against someone's honor.

The act of assaulting someone's body is the act that obligates qi~~ (legal
retribution), diyah,' or expiation. Muslim scholars unanimously agree on the
prohibition of taking a person's life without right. The proof of this prohibition
is derived from both the Ever-Gloriou_~ Book, the Qur'an, and the Sum1ah
(Prophetic Tradition). Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"And do not kill the soul [i.e. person] which Allah has forbidden,
except by right..."
(Qur'an: AI-An' am: 151)

IX QISAS. (LEGAL RETRIBUTION)

"The blood ofa Muslim who testifies that there is no deity but Allah'
and that I am /;fis Messengerccmnot be shed except in one of three
cases: the case of n married person who commits adultery, in qi~~
(lega-1 retribution) for murder, a11d the one who revem from Islam
(i,e. qpostates) and lea,,'es the Muslim community.'..,
(Rdated by Muslim and other compilers of Had.1th)
There are variou5 b.adith.s that caJTy the same meanfng of the aforementioned one.
Therefore, whoever take~ the life of a Muslim intentionally and without
right, Allah, Exalted be He, will punish him severely in the Hereafter, ~s
He says:

Such a muroerer is. regarded as a defiantly disobedient person. as be
commits on.e of the maj<;>r sir.is, namely murder. Still, Allah is the One to judge
such a person; He will punish him if He wilb or forgive him if He willj. Allall,

However, the righr of 1he murdered person is not dropped in the Hereafter
by the repentance of lhe m urderer. vhe 'light of the murdered person. will be,
taken from the good deeds of his murderer according to the wrong done to
him, or Allah will grant the murdered person good deeds out of His bounty,

According ti) the majority ofNjloslim schofars, there are three kinds ofkil(ing:

• Premeditated murder
• Quasi-premegitated murder
• Manslaughter
As for the .premeditated killing and manslaughter, they are 5tated ln the

Concerning the .rulillg on quasi-premeditated murder, i t ts stated 1n the.

reported on the authority of his father and grandfather respectively thal' the

fatal. '11\is definition involves that the case is not regarded as premeditated
murder unless tlie following conditions ate me.t:
l )HaVing the intention of killing
2) Being previously aware of the invioiability of the victim;s blood as a
human,being
3) The weapon or the tool used is a fataione, wllether it is specified for
killing or not
Therefore, if one of these conditions is not present, the case will not be
regarded as premeditated murder. This is because the absence ,of intention
does not obligate q~~ (legal retribution), and the occurrence of death with
something th11t ls not supposed to be fatal indkatesthat death may have been
due to something else as scholars agreed.
According to induction, there are nine forms of premeditated murder:

i - The murderer wounds a person with something sharp and bodypenetrating; such as a knife, a spike. or the like. In this regard, AlMuwaffaq said,, ':4.s f4r as we know, !here is 110 juristic disagreement
among scholars on 1/Jis ruling (I.e. killing using such too/$ is deemed
premeditated murder),"

1- Themurdert>r kills a person with something heavy, such as a stone and
the like. 'fherefore, if the stone, for ?ample, is small, 11\e case will not
be regarded as premeditated murder, unles.~ it ls intentionaily aimed at
a vital spot of the body. Simil11riy, it will he regarded as premeditated
murder ifsuch a small stone.(thatusuaily does not cause death) ls Used
whiie,the victim is in a state of weakness,, illness. youngness, oldness,

cp(dness, hotness, and the like. The same appli~ when the murderer
repeats the action of bea,ting the victim witli such a small stone or
the like until he dies. Thiis is aiso similar to tl:ie cases when a person
kills another by letting a wall fall on him, hitting hjm with a car, or
throwing him from a high place.
3- The murderer throws a p,er~n to a deadly animal, such as a lion or
a serpent Thus, if .one i.Jitentionally throws another to sum deadly
creatures, the case is deemed premeditated murder, for such creatures
are generally known to be killers.

4- The murderer throws a pe1rson ioto fire or deep water, which may cau~e
him to drown, whne the ,iictim .cannot escape from them.
5- lbe murderer strangles a person with <1 rope Or the like or stifles him
to death.
6- The murderer imprisons the victim ;md depdves him of food and
drink until he dies, being imprisoned for a period in which anyone
is supposed to die out of bunger and thirst if they do not find food. or
·water, Such a case is consiideced premeditated murder.
7- The nmrderer,.knowingly, uses sorcery or black magic that often causes
dearh to the victim.
8- The murderer knowingly makes the. victim drink poison or cunnlngly
mixes it with the victim's food whilt' the latter is unaware.
,_ Sotne witnesses falsely testify against someone causing the latter to be
serilenced lo death, as in c:ases like ail.ttltery, apostasy, qr premeditated
murder, whose peoalty in Islam is capital punishment. Such witnesses
ate regarded as murderers., as they intentionally kill an innocent penon.
So, if they renege on thei1r testimony m· i f their plor l~ disclosed, d1ey
are to be sentenced to dea,tl\ as well.

Quasi-premeditated Murder
According lo faqllts, quasi-p1-emeditated murder occurs when someone
kills 3J1other with the intention of causing him hatm or injury, not death,
Such a case is regarded as quasi-p,remec;litated murder ~hether the murderer's
purpose is11ggressionor mere disciplinary punishment, as the offender exceeds
the limits in doing so until it results in death. It is called "quasi- premeditated
murder" as the perpetrator just intends hpr,u or injqry, but be uninten1ionally
kills the viotim. In thi~ connectlo1\, lbn Rushd said:

':t\s for the one w/10 lnt~11d, harm lo another person and strl/.es him
with something generally nonfatal, the ruling wavers between intentional and u11£nte11tio11qlkilli11g, i t is similar lo premeditated murder

intended to cause dea1h,"~
Among the examples of quasi-premeditated murder is the case in which
one strikes a p erson in a non-viral bodily spot with a whip or small stick.
Another example ls the casewhenone punchesanotherwith the hand in anon•
vital spot bur it results in the latter's death. Such cases are regarded as quasipremedita.ted murder th..t obligates expiation taken from the perpetrator's
money. The expiation for quasi-premeditated murder is emancipating a
slave; if the perpetrator,does not have a slave or cannot afford to buy one to
emancipate, he must perform fasting for two consecutive months, Just like·
the case of manslaughter. In addition, binding diyah (blood money) i.s to bepaid by the murderer's agna(e relatives, To illustrate, AbO Hurayrah (may
•
Allah be pleased with him) narrated:

"T1¥0 women from (the tribe of) Hudhayl fought with each other
and one of them hit l'/1e other with ii stone that killed both her and
rhe fehlS she carries. The kille,''s agnate relatives and those o.fthe.
,,ictim submitted their case to the Pmphet (PBUH) who judged that
the diyahfor the murdered woman was lo 'be.paid by the murderer's
i1gnate relatives."'
(.Related by Al-.Bttkhari and Muslim)
Hence, .t he aforementioned l!adi'th shows that qf~ii~ (legal retributiQn) is
not obligatory in the case of quasi-premeditate.d murder. Tt also indicates
that the diyah is to be paid from the wealth of the murderer's agnate relatives.
Since it is considered a murder that does not obligate qis~ the dlyah is to
be paid by the murderers relatives just like the case of manslaughter. In thfo
regard, Jbnul-Mnndhir said, "All Muslim scholars 11111wimously agree that the

diyah (for quasi-premeditated mtlrder) is to be paid by tl,e murderer's agnate
relative5."• In addition, Al•Muwaffaq said, wwe know no jµrislic disagreement
ott the ruling that 'lhe diy<lh (for quasi'-premeditated murder) is to /,e paid by
the murderer's ngnate relati..ves."• The same opinion was adopted by other
scholars as wen.

Manslaughter
Acrordlng to faqih.s (may Allah have metcy on them), manslaughter o<;a.1rs
when someone kills an inviol.able human being by mistake while doing something
perplissible for him to do. such as shooting or hunting, The same applies when a
Muslim kills a fellow Muslim in a baitle, thinking he is one of tbe disbelievers.
The .ruling on the intentional murder committed by a child or an insane
person is the same as that on rnanslaughter. This. is because the conditi9n
of intention iS' laddng in case of such pen;ons (due to their iack of mental
maturity or soundness). Thus, ·the premeditated murder of a minor or an
insane is regarded as the mansJa11ghter of a legally accountable person.
Likewise, the ruling on killin,g due to being a caus~ve f~r is the same
as that of manslaughler. For example, when one digs a well or a hole on a road
01· a street and anothei, faJJs therein and dies, or when one stops a car on the
road or a street and' one crashes ,against it and dies, 1be ruling in such cases is
the same as that of mansla~gh\et.
The expiation for manslaugh.ter is oblagatory to be taken from the wealth
of the murderer; the expiation for it is the emancipation of a belaeving slave,
and if one does not have one or i:annot afford lo buy one to emancipate, the.n
he should perform fasting for l:wo consecutiw months instead. Moreover,
the diyah. for manslaughtt!r •is obligatory to be paid by the P,erpetrator's male
agoate reli\tives.
Furthermore, if a Muslim ki1ls a Muslim mistakenly in a war believing Ihat
he is one of the disbelievers, .them will be nothing obligatory on him eJOCept for
the expiation. Allah, Exaited be He, says:

(Qur'fui: An-Nisa': 92)

JX QISM (lEGAl RETRIBUTJONJ

522

Hence, Allah, Exalted be Ke, stated tlvo kinds of mans.laughter:

F!rst: the first kind of manslaughrer is that 1n which the expiation is
obligatory on the mu.rderet Rlld the diyah on his agnate relatives. 11tis
kiud involves killing ,abeliever unintentionally without mistaking him
for a disbeliever in the battlefield. The same ruling applies 10 the case
of unintentional killirng of one of those with whom Muslims have ~
peace treaty;

.Second: the second kind oCmanslaughter is that in w!iich only the diyah

is obligmtory. This kind involves killing a believer llitin!entionally in
the battlefield, mistaking.him for one of the disbelieving enemies.
fn 'his book entitled Fat/lul-Q11dir (The Bestowal of the Omnip<1tenl),
Tmam Ash-Shawkani (may Allah have metty oa him) said:·

The proofofthe fact' that it is obligatory for theperpetcators agnaterelntives
to pay the dlyah in case of manslaughter is derived from the following /lad/t-1,
narrated by AbO Hurayrab tmay Allah be pleased wilh him), He narrated:
"T/1e Messenger of Allah (PBUH) gave the judgmelll that a ,nale
or female slave is to be given (as diyahJ. in compensation for an
abol'tion of a woman from (the tribe of) Ba11t'1 Lab.ya11, Then the
woman on whom the compe11satlo11 liad been imposed died, so
t/1e Messenger ofAlla/1 (PBUH) ordered that her offsprfng and her
hu,bm1d are to i11/1erit he, property and that her agnate relatives
ate to pay the diya/r (blood moneyJ"''

(Related by Al-Bukharh md Muslim)
So, the !iadrth states that the diyal-1 for manslaughter is to be paid by
the perpetratot's agnate relatives; an opinion on which there isq,nsensus
among scholars,
Perhnps the wisdom behind thii. opiniorl is that if the d1yah for manslaughter
is to be paid by the perpet:rai-or, there will l:)e a great financial hann caused
to him for a sin he has unintentionally committed, as such accidenls happen
recurrently, Thu:;. if the committer is to shoulder the consequences alone, te,
paying the diyah, it will be regarded as doing him financial injustice. On the
other hand, t here must be a kind of compensation for the murdered person,
as he is considered an inviolable soul, whose killing causes hnrm to his heirs,
especially his family, Hence, the Wise Lawgiver" obliges those who stand
beside and support the perpetrator to help him in 6Uch a mailer (i.e. in paying
Qie dlyah), ju~t li,ke the oblig;itlon of prbviding for their needy relatives or
freeing their captivated relatives, Since one's agnate relatives generally inherit
from one when one dies, they have to compensate on one's behalf when
one commits manslaughter due to rhe g~neral principle b1ating, "Sharing in
affliction in tttum -for getting benefit."

However, 1he expiation is obligotMy oh the pcrpetratnr of mansl11ugh1er
for the folloWing reasons:
L Such expiation -is a means of showiog respect to the inviolable mur~
dered soul.

IX QISI/S. (LEGAL R.El.RlBl.lTION)

3. Sud1 expialion do,e~ not allow the perpetrator to be comp)etely
free from paying for his guilt; since the diyah is not obligatory
upon him (as J~ is Jpald by his agnate relatives), he must expiate for
hig offense.
That is to say, there are i:evernl wisdomsand benefits behind obligating the.
payment of diya/1 upon the perpeb'3tor's agnate relatives and the expiation for
1:he mansh,ughter upon the· perpetnitor himself. Glory be to Allah, the Wise
and the Knowing, Who has ordained for people what benefits them in bolh
their religious- and worldly :ih•es.
It is important to point out that siaves, poor people, minors, insane people.
females, and those of religjons different from that of the p~etrator, are not
considered among the perpetraior's agnate relatives (who are obliged 10 pay
the diyah ), as they are not a:rpong those who ore supposed to be his supporters
and backers.
In this conneciion, the :~gnatei-elatives of the perpetrator of manslaughter
are allowed to defer the pa:yment ofthe diyah for three years. Moreover, the
magistrate (or the one in authority) should resort to ijtlhlid to specify a certain
share of the diyah for each of them to pay according 10 their financial states.
In doing so. he 1s to ,begin v,ith Ilie closest relatives, the rt the closer, an.d so on

Qisas for Murder

Muslim scholars unanimously agree on the legality of qi1a1 (legal retribution) for murder in the case of prc:meditated murder provided the conditions
of such a murder are met. This is because Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"O you who have believed,, prescribed for you is legal retribution
for those murdered - the free for the free, the slave for the slave,
and the female for the female ..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 178)
Allah, Exalted be He, also says:
'½nd We ordained for them therein a life for a life ..."
(Qur'iln: A1-Ma'idah: 45)
This is also stated in the Law o.f the Torah, and we are to abide by the laws
of the previous heavenly revealed l'eligions as long as they are not abrogated by
ow- Sharf· ah (Islamic Law). In addition, Allah, Exalted be He, says:

JX QJJj.,{f (LEGAL RETRIBUTION)

?Ahil tl1ete is for ya,.,in legal retribution (sal•i,ig of} lift, 0 you
[people] ofunderHtandlng, tJ1at you ,nay berome righteous."
(Qur'An: AJ-Baqarah: 179)
Jmim Ash-Sbawkaru (o:aay Aiiali iiAve mercy on him) commented on the

aforementioned verse Sijyingi
"'I'liere is saving of life ,in this ruling ordained by Allah, as when one
bears in mind that ther,e is ql1a~ (legal retribution) if he.kills another,
he will abstain from Hiling, avoid it, and restrain himself from

of saving human lives. This ver5e is a great example of eloquence, as
Al111/i made the qis/ls.fo,· m11rde1; which is death, a means ofpreserving
/wman live5. This is be.cause s11c}1 a ruling deters people from ki./ling
Ohe another to preserv,i and maintain their ow11 lives. In this verse,
AIIC1h addresses tire 'peo_ple ofunderstanding', as th,?' are the ones who

from their actions. Some of tltose murder.oi,s persons said::

'"I w/ll dear ,ny disgrace with my sword
And let Allah ordain far me whatever 11.e may ord11in"
Tl1e11, AJ/ah, Exalted. be He, shows tl1e reasoti behind ordaining
rctribt1tion (9iiasJ in CA!Se ofmimler saying, ~ .. tliat you may become
righteous.' ( Qur'an: AJ-Baqarah: 21) That is ta say, avoidi11g killing
because ofthe q~~ becomes a means leC1dlng to rig11teousnl!SS.'''
In this connection, the .Simnah (Prophetic Trodltion) states tho.t the heir
or legal representative of the murdered person would choose one of three
choices: to seek qi;il~, to pardon th~ murderer in reh.rm for the dryah, or fo
pardon him and give it (i.e. \he diyah) up, whichjs considered the best thing to
do. Abo Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet
(PBUH) said:
•·whoever suffe.rs the murder ofa. relative, hehas the,choice between
two options: either lie· may receive t/1e payment of diyah (blood
irroney) or he may choose qi,/1~ (legal relribulion)."'

Moreover, Allah, Exalted be He, says:

(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 178)
J'hu~. hoth the verse and lhe 11.adith mentioned abov«! indicate that
the relati.ve or the legal representative of the deceased has the right to
choose between carrying out the qi5.ii£ and receiving the diyah. Yet.
pardoning the murderer -and giving up the diyah is considered the best
thing to be done by the dece11sed's hei.r or legal representative. Allah,
Exalted be He; says:
H,,

,A,ul to forego it is nea:rer to righteousne&$,, ."

(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 237)
This is also supported by thel1adith narr:ited by Abu Hui-ayrah (may Allah
be pleased with him) in which the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"No person .forgives an act ,if injustice (done to him) but Allah will
add to his honor for it,"'
(Rel~ted by Ahmad, Muslin1, ond At-Titmidhl)
Moreover, forgoing the q¼,~ (legal retribution) is the best thing to do•as
1011g as it does not cause evil or nny kind of corruption. ShaykhuJ-Ishim Ibn
Taym1yah (may Allah have mercy on him) maintained, "Pardoning is 1101 to·be

the q¼d,r is to be applied on the k.Uler of Imams (Muslim rulers), -0s it is an act
of general €orruption. The great Muslim scholar lbntii-Qayyim commented

530

The heirs or the legal n!presentatives of the killed person do not have
the right of qi-,a,_ (legal retribution) unless the following four c;onditions
are met,

i - The murdered persc,n musr be one ofthose whose blood is inviolable,
as qis~ was ordain,ed to save human lives. Thus, if a Muslim kills
a disbeliever wi]ose people :ire in a state of war with Muslims, or i f
he kills- an apostate before the latter declares his repentance or an
adulterer, there willl be neither <Ji~el,i. nor diyah due on the part of

the perpetrator. Yet, he is to undergo discrel.ionary punishment for
arrogating to himse,lf the ruler's authority.

2- The murderer must be mature and sane, for qis_11$c is a severe punishment that is not pe'm\issible lo be applied to a minor or an insane
whose case is lacking the conditio11 of intention and premeditation, or
thefr intentions, if any, are deemed void. Tliis is hased on the /jµdtth of
the Prophet (PBUH;1in which be-said:

"There are three (pt rso11s) whose actions are n.ot recorded: a sleeper
rmtil he awakes, a r,;rinor mail /;e readies puberty, aml II lunatlc until

/·,e comes to reason,"'
Imam Muwaffaqud--Dln fbn Qudamah said:
'"l11ere is 110 disagreement ,mrong Mu.slim .scholars that there is !JO qii~

to be exacted against a minor or an 111s1111t'; the same applies to anyone
in a state of uncomdousnes.s due to cm excusable reason, such as being
asleep or losing comc:iousness."'
3° 'There must be equjyaleoce between the '!lllrdered person and

the murderer when. the ·action of killi,ng has taken place, In olher
words, they must be equal in ~el(gion, a.nd f.reedom or slavery. That
is, the murderer sh.ould not be superior to the murdered p erson
~ue 10 being a Muslim or being afr~e person while the murdered is
a disbeliever or slave. Accordingly, a Muslim is not to be sentenced
to death in qi~as_ fo1: 1/-illing a disbeliever. To illustrate, the Prophet
(!>BUH) said:

"No Jvluslim .shvuld' bt kllleil ir1 11ir6~ (legal retribution) for killing

• bet·,ever.·•
a dts

(Related by Al-Bukhartand Abu Dawtld)

Chapter 'l: QM; for Muidcr

531

Moreover, a free person is not to be killed in qi,i_,4_ for killing a slave, as
Imam Ahmad refated that · Ali Iba Abu T'alib ( may Allah be pleased
with him) said:

"It is an act of the S111moli rhat 1111 free person is lo be killed in ,qi,;.tiA.for
killing a sla vet
This is because if the murdered person ls not equal to the mur,lerer
with regard to lhe aforementioned aspects, carrying out the qi,:~ on
the latter will be more than what the murdered person is•entitled to.
No preference is to be taken into consideration between the
1nurdered person and the murderer in matters other than those
mentioned above. So, a handsome person is not preferred to an
ugly one; if the former kills the latter, the qis.tlo. is to be applied.
11he same ruling applies when an honorable man kills a mean
one, an adult kills a minor, a male kflls a female, or asane-persim
kills an insane one. This is due to the genera.lity of tJ1e Qur'anic
verse In which Allah, Exalted be He, says:
'~d We ordal11edf<>r them therein a lifeflll" a life...~
(Qur'fui: AI-Maidah: 45)

IX QfSAi (LEGAL Rl>rRllll.f['IONl
Yet, the case when ,a parent killsauy ofhis/her children is an exeeption
of rhe aforesaid general ruling according to the legal proofs.

Hence, if the aforementioned four conditions are met, the relatives or the
legal representatives of the murdered person will have the right of qi,/J,1.

11\ fact, Allah's ordainment of q/ia~ involves a divine mercy on people as
well as a means of saving human lives, as Allah, Exalted be13,e, says:
"A11d there.is forrou ;,; legal retriblltio11 [savillg of] life...."

(Qur'an; AI-Baqarah: 179)
So woe to those who claim thnt the obligation of qii/11 involves brutality
and mercilessness. Such p~opk do oot consider the cruelty of the offender
when he kills an innocent person, spreads panic j n the country; widows
women, orphans children, and ruins houses, Such people show men.")' toWBl'd
the murderer rather than the innocent, so woe to their narrow-mindedness
and unenUghtenment. ln this regard, Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"Then is it the. judgtt1ent off the time of] igmirance, they desi1,e?
JJut who Is better tha11 Allah 111 judgment for a people who an
certain (in faith]."
(Qur'An: Al-Ma idah; 50)
'!'he qi~a~ is a retaliatory punishment ex.acted by the ~ictim or his/her heir
or legal rep,resentative against tlle offender, returnlf\g like for like or evil for
evil. The wisdom behind qi1a1 is that ii quenches !he flames of wrath and ite of
the victim or his/her people. Allah, Ex.-.ilted be He, ordaiued qi~tli as a means of
rcstmining aggression, extinguishing the flames of wrath In the hearts, letting
tlie murderer taste what he bus done to Ii.ls vicrl111, ,tnd saving and preserving
liuman lives.
In t'h!soonnection, the people of the Pre-fslamic Period of Ignorance (the
fiihi/iyyn/r) used to exaggera1·e tn Tetaliation, killing other innocent people, in
additio11 to the murderer, 1n revenge. This is undoubtedly a kind of aggression
andenflaming of the passions that does tiot fultlll 1heplltpose o(fuir retribution.
Rather, it is considered a means of more dissention and bloodshed. This is wby
Islam aod its perfect Shari'ali (L~lamic Law) ordain q{iOi. through which fair
retaliatf1m is ex:eculed ottly against the perpetrator, not against any innocent
people; thus just ice, mercy, and prevenfion ofhloodshed .!re aduevecl.

We have previously mentioned t he conditions obligatin.g qiJil,;.. However, ff
such condilioo.s are ml:lt and thus the qi~~ is obligated, it is not to be carried out
m,less some other conditions die fiilfilled. Those conditions have been stated

Chopr<r 2: Q/Iiii for Murder

5 33

by faqlhs (may Allah nave mercy on U\~m}, Who cal! them, "the conditions for
the fulfillment of qis4" They are three conditions:
1- The one who bas the right to carry out th~ qi,!.~ in retaliation is t.1 be
,a legally accountable person. That is, one in this case must be adult
and sane. Therefore, iftl-,e one (or one of those) entitled to carry out
the qi~¾. is a minor or an im'.lne person, one's guardian is not to carry
It out on one's behalf. Thjs is because the qii~ involves vengeance to
-qu~nch one's- thirst of-one'6 wrnth, ·so its purpose will not be attained
If ii is token by others on ,one's bebalf.'Therefore, <tjie fulfiUment of the
q~~ must be postponed in such a case, and the offender is to be jailed
UJ+tll the one who has the right of qi1ai reaches puberty if he/she ls a
minor or regains sanity ~f he/she is an 'ln$~ne person. This is because
Mu '.\wiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) jailed Hudb<1:h 'Ibn
Khashrarn in a case entailing qi.tdtuntil the son of the murdered person
reaohed puberty, and none of the Propheifs Companions who lived at
that time denied that ruling. Hence, it was consi<lered a unanin1ous
agreement by the Companions contemporary to Mu ·awiyah (may
All;ili be pleased with him) on that ruli,;ig, In sttch a case, if the minor
or !he insane person who is entitled to carry out the qi,t~needs money
for expenditure, only the· guardian of the insane person has the right
to forgo the qi..4£ and acc:ept the 4fytil1 in6tead. This is because no one
know~ when sanity is regaiJ1ed, unlike lhe minor who will grow L!P
and reach. puberty anywa1y.

2- There must be an agreernenr among the legal repr~sentatives of the
murdered person if the qi,.a1. is to be carried out. Therefore, it fa
·not permib'Sible for some of them to carry it out single-handedly
without the consent of the others. This fa because, fulfilling the qi,~
is considered a shared undividable right, so ifsome of them fulfil'!
'it on their own initiativt:, they thus ·transgress lhe right of the other
representatives without their permission and withouJ being their
!eg.11 guardian.
1n this reg;,rd, if any of•those having the right of qia~ ls absent, a
.minor, or insane. .t he fulfillment of ,jii~ is to be delayed until the
absent returns, the mio,ot teacbe$ puberty, .\I.Qd me ios~ne reg;lins
sanity. Moreover, if any ,of those entitle.d to carry out the qis.~ dies,
his he1u are to act in thi.i, regard on his behalf. In .addition, if some of
tho~e entitled to carry mit the qi~~ agree to forgo it, then tl\e qi~ is
no longer applicable.

IX QJSJiS \LEGAL RETIU llU'J 'ION)

The people entitled to carry out the giJili are all the heir~ of tl-ie
decea~ed, men or women and children or ,1dults, whether through
blood or marlin! tie!:. Howeve,·, some scholars maintain that the right
of fulfilling or forgoing the ql£ili is restricted to the deceased's agnate
relatives. The latter is the opinion adopted by fmam Mnlfk nnd one
of the opinions repoJrted to be adopted by l.miim Ahmad. It is also
the opinion maintatned by Shaykhul-Islam !bu Taymiyah (may Allah
pave rpercy 011 bi11.1J.
3- Exe,utiugthe t7i,,~ should never reach persons other than the offender,

for Allah. Exalted be f:!e, says:

"... And whoever Is kilife,l rinj11stly- W$/1ave gtvtn Iris heir authority,
but let 1,1111 not exceed:limits in {the matter Qj] raking life. Indeed, he
ha$ been suppQrted [!,y the lawJ.u
(Qur'an: Al-lmft 3))
Therefore, if the·acdon of carrying out the q¼.llI exceeds the limits,
it is considered exc,es,iveness, which is forbiddeo according to the
aforementioned noble Qur'anic verse, A.ccordingly, if the qi1a1 is to be
applied to a pregnamt woman or a woman who conceived aft~r being
liable for the qiJ/r~, s'he ls not to be killed in q¼d$. ii.ntil she gives birth
to her baby. This-i.~ h eaiuse kllling such a pregnant woman causes tl'1e
death of the fetus de:spile its innocence; Allah. Exalted be He. says:

';, ,And 110 b~ar,' f of burde11s ·will beai· fl1e burden ofat11lt1ier..."
(Qur'!in: Al-An · am: 164)
Hence, !he pregnant ,murderer is not to be killed in reraliation unless
she glves hi-rlh to be:r baby. furthermore, after she gives birth to the
baby, if there is ano1ther woman to breastfeed and take care of the
infont, the qj~tii can bearplied to the mother, as there will be no bnrriec
preventing the execu lion of the qf,a.i. rhen. Otherwise, carrying out the
qi114 is to be delayed for two years, until the 111other weans her infonL
This is because the P:ropht.ll (PBUH} ~•)'li:

"lj a pregnant woman /11te,1timtallJ• murders someone, sl,e is nat to be
killed (ir1 qiiii,V 1mti.l she gives birth a11d cares for lier baby, And if flwomt1n commits,adu,/tery (mu/ becomes pregnant), slie is 1101 to be killed
(as legal punishment) 11111-il slie,give~ birth and cares far her baby:•"
(Rduted by lbn Maj~J1)
Moreover, the Prophet (PBUU) ~nid addre.-sing the ·woman who
tontessed co,111n itt.in,g adultery:

Chapr<r 2, Q/JA! for Mlltdc:r

535

"Go home iintil you give birl!t.' Later, When she gave birth to the baby
and came back to the Prophet (PBUH), be said to her, "Go home until
~ uH
you wean h1111.
Thus, the two l1adltT1s, as weD as the Qur'anic verse mentioned above,
indicate the obligation ofdelaying the qi~~ for murder jfthe perpetrator
is pregnant, and this is urnonlmously agreed upon by Muslim scholars.
Such obligation is a proof of the perfection and justice of Shcll'i ' 11h,
as it maintains the fetuses 'ln their mothers' wombs, and prohibits
q.usfng them a11y l\<1rr11, Moreover, Shflri •afr ob,erves the rights of
children as weli as the weak, protecting them ugainst any hatlll and
providing them with what preserves their lives. So, all praise be to
Allah for endowing us with ~uch a lenient, perfect, compr~henstve
Shatr 'ah that encornpass,es all people"s interests.
Executing the qi,a~ for murder has to be in the presence aod und~r the
supervision of the ruler {or his representative or the one in authority), to avnid
injustice aoc,i eusure the legality of ex.ecotion. Moreover, the tool used for
executing the qii,lis, for milrdet must be quite sharp, such as a sword or a krtife,
for the Prophet (.PBUH) .says:

"When you kill (in qi,,ai}, do it i 11 a good manner (i.e. gently a11d
mercijr11ly).•u

Thus, it is prohibited to e.~e,cute the qi!<i~ u~ing a blunt tool, as 1h;s ISconside_red excessiveness in killing,

1f the peISon entitled to exe·cute the qi!~ is able to peJ-form it in the
prescribed legal manner, he ls allowed .lo do it. If not, he is to be ordered by
the ruler .(or the one in authority:\ to appoint another person to perform it 0 1\
his behalf.
As for retaliation, the most preponderant opinion among scholars is tnat
the offender is to be punished .i n a way equal to the harm he caused to tl'te
victim. This is because Allah, EX2Jted be He, says:
':4.n,1 ff yo11 punish (a11 enemy, 0 belie,,ers), punbh with an
eq11ivaleni of tl1at with w.hich you were flan11ed...n

(Qur'iln: An-Nahlt 126)
Allah, Exalted be He. also says:
•~ .. So whoever h,u ussau'lr.ed you, the11 RSstmlt T,lm in the same
way that lie has assaulted you...»
(Qucan: Al-Baqarah: 194)

Ill; Q!S/ii {LEGAL RETRfBITTIQN)

Jn ~ddition, ,the Pr9phet,(PBUH) ordered that the !iead of a few should be
crushed between two stones i'n retaliation for crushing the head of a girl,ofthe
An.!.ar (the Supporters}".
lmAm lbnul-Qayyim ( m1ay Allah have mercy on him) said:

"The Quran m,d tire J)rinciples ofj ustfce agree that the offender,
before being killed in retribution, is to be retaiiated against in
the same way he did to the victim before. murdering him. Thar
was applied by the Prophet (PBUH), and it is proved through
the 'Quri1n, Sunnah (,Prophetic Tradition), and the traditions of
.
. ,.
Compa111ons, ..
Hence, if the perpetr'dto,, has cut off the hand of lhe victim a nd then killed
him, he is to be punished in the same way be acted, i.e. his hand is to be cut off
and then he is to be killed in retribution. Similarly, if the perpetrator has killed
the victim with a stone, or has drowned him, or anything of the kind, lie is to
be punished in the same way before killing him, Still, the deceaseds heir or
legal representative, who is entitled to carryoul theqi~4!.. has the right to,forgo
such retaliation for injuries- and make the qi$4i restricted to cutting off lhe
head of the offender with n .sword, and this is more favorable. In this respect,
if the offender has killed the victim with an unlawful means, be is lo be killed
Wilh ,i sword iQ qi5~. Nowadays, the act ofkilling with a sworcf in qi~~ can he
replaced with killing by shooting, provided it is performed by someone who
shoots acrurately.

Qisas for Parts of the Body
and Wounds

The qi~ai for parts of the body and wounds is stated according to the Qur'an,
the Sunnah, and the consensus of Muslim scholars. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
'~11d We ordai11ed for them therein a life for a life, an eye for a11
eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for a11 ear, a tooth for a tooth, and
for wounds is legal retributio n ..."
(Qurln: AI-Ma'idah: 45)

Moreover, it is recorded in the Two Authentic Books (of Al-Bukhari and
Muslim) that when Ar-Rubayyi' broke a girl's incisor, the Prophet (PBUH) said:

"(The law prescribed in) the Book ofAllah is qi~~-" '
Thus, the ruling applying to the killing of a human soul is to be applied
regarding parts of the body and wounds, provided that the aforementioned
conditions for the validity of the qi1ai are met. Such conditions involve that

540

IX QIW(LEGAL RfffRIRUTION)

the Victim's blood must be inviolable, the offender must be mature and sane,
both the offender and the victim m~t be equal as regards slavery or freedom,
and the offender is not to be one of the ,1ctim's parents. On the other hand, the
ruling inapplicable in the case of killi11g is inapplicable in !he case of injuries of
parts of the body llr\d wounds; this is the general rule in this connection.
Likewis¢, the condition that obligates the ,qiiil! for parts of the- body and
wounds is the same as that which obligates it for killing, namely premeditation.
Accordingl}I there-is no qis.111 in cases ·of injuries- done by mistake or quasiintentional ones. With regard to qi!"li for parts of the body, an tye is to be
taken in retaliation for an eye, a no.se for a pose. an ear for an ear, a hand for a
hand. a foot for a foot, etc.; the right organ for the rigpt organ and the left for
the left. By the 6a!De token, a tooth of the offender is to be broken in retaliation
for a similar tooth of the victim, an upper eyelid for an upper eyelid, a lower·
eyelid for a lower eyelid, an upper Up for an upper lip, and a lower lip for a
lower llP- This is because Allah.Jlxalted be He; says:

".,,_and fur wounds is legal retribution .. _,,
(Qur'fln: Al-~'idah: 45)
This is be€ause eyelids and iips l\ave uppet and lower parts which should
be considered in order to rnake the qi~c11_ carried .olit accurately. In addition,
the sam~ finger of the perpetrator ls to b~ taken in retaliatipn for that of tho
victim, and a cigot hand for a right hand, a left band foe a left 'band, a right
elbow for a right elbow, and so on and so forth, as such parts of the body can
be accur-ately distingui5hed. Likewise. a penis, is to be taken iu retaliation for
a penis, as a penis has -11 specific end. so the qi~d~ can be accurat(lly exacted,
without tran5gression. This is indicated 1n the general meaning of the Qur'anic
verse that states:
". ..andfor wou11ils is legaf retribution ..."

(Qt1r'An: Al-Mtidak 45)
There are three conditions for the validity of the qli~ for parts of the body:

First: There must be assurance that there will be neither injustice nor
itansgression , That is, cutttng off the part of the body in retaliation
must be from a specific joint or to a certain point. Thus, if there is
no specific limit, ret~iiation Will be impermissible. In other words,
there is no retribution applicable for an unlimited wound, such.as a
deep flesh-cutting wound thal reac;hes ope's abdomen, .tS there is no
specific depth that can be pointed out. Simllady, there is no retribution

Chap-"'' 3: Q.4til for,()am; of the Body and \\i'ouuds

541

applicable for fractures (not teeth breaklng) such as breaking someone's
tibias, femurs, or arm, as accurale application of retaliation cannot be
guaranteed. As for breaking someone's tooth, the q~~ can be accurately
applied by rasping the tooth of the perpetrator until it becomes just like
that of the victim broken by the former.

Second: There must be equlval'ence between the part of the body of the
offender and that of the Victim in both name ancl location, That is, a
right org-.in is not to be cut off in retr,ibution for cutting off a left one
apd v1ce yersa; this-applies to hands, legs, eyes, ears, and the like, This is
because each of the aforementioned organs has aspecifk name and use,
so they ate different from eaGh other, For example, a little finger is not
to be cut off in reLaliation for a ,ring finger, for.each has a different name.
Similarly, a main body part is not to be cutoff fo, a secondary one.
Third: The body part of the perpetr;itor in question must be in the same
condition a~ that of the victim regarding soundness arid rnmpletlon.
So, a sound , functional hand or leg is not 10 be cui off in retaliation
for a paralyzed one. Lilcewlse, a J\and or leg with complete fingers ls
not to be cut off for a defective hand or leg, Furthermore. the q4'4 Is
not to be applied to a sou'.nd eye for a blind one, as they-are not equal.
Similarly, a $0Wld, articulate tongue is not to be cut off in retribution.
for a speechl'ess one, due to the irtferiorit}< of the latter.
.Contrarily, a defective org.ui can be out off in retribution for a sound,
complete organ. That is, a paralyzed limb can be cut off for-a functional
one, and a defective limb (such as one having incomplete fingers) can
be cut 6ff in retaliation for a sound one. This is because the defective
organ is similar to the sound organ in respect of the nature of creation,
but they differ in quality. Moreover, by cutting off the defective organ,
the one who has the right of qi~tq rereives parr of his right, so there.
will be neither injustice nor excessiveness. And ifhe is not sati9fled, it is
pel'Jllissible for him to,receive the 4iyah (indemnity) instead.

Q~ii! for Wounds
The qi.s.ai is to be carried our for every wound tha1 reaches the,boneS', ;1s It
can be exact~d with neither injustice nor exce-SSiveness, such as th~ wound 0£
the head,, face, upper arm, leg; thigh and foot. Thi8 is because Allah. Exalted
be He-, says:
''...a11d for wounds is legal rehibution......
( Qur'an: Al-M.\'idah1 45)

IX QIStfS (Ll:.GAL RE'fllll3UT16N)

As fortbe -wounds thal' do notreach the bones, it is impermissible to apply
the qi,.fi! to them, even if they are head wounds onhe like. To illustrate, there
is no retribution applicable as regards the case of the wound ill the lnt.e mal
part of the abdomen, the chest or the upper part of the che.~t, as the depth
of the wound cannot be. specified so there ls qo assurance that there will 'be
neither injustice nor excessiveness. In this regard, Ibn Majah related that the
Prophet (PBUH) said,

"No qiilii is lo be exec11tet.i irt a skull fracturing wound, an abdomen

deep flesh-culling wo1md, nor 1.1 bone-brealcing-a11d-dislocati1ig
wound."

l

Moreover, Sbaylchula!slam Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on hirn) said:

"The tJi4'4for wounds is stated by the Noble Quran, the Sunnah
(ltfd the consensus of Muslim scholars.provided that the retaliatory
injury is j11st like the original 011e, That is, ifthe head ofa person is
fractured by someone, the in]ured pQrson ha5 the right to retaliate
for it i11 the same way. .But ifit is 11nattai11able to e.wct just, 11cc1.1ra/e

kind of head fracture less In degree lha11 a bo1te-cleati11g wo1111d,
l't!tnb11tion becomes impermis.sible, and lhe diyah (i,rdemnity).
becomes obligatory instead."
A~ for applying the qiJ~ in cases of striking- someone wilh the hand, a
stklc. a whip, or the like, Shiykhul-[slam lbn 1aym.iyllh said:

"Some scholars say that tTiere Is 110 retributio11 (, qi.lA1} in such cas,:.s,
/1111 thetem11sr be a disr.relioMry p,mishmellt: Howe,,er, it is reportr1J

Qisas w·hen a Group
Kills ai1 Individual

When a group of people prem,editatedly and wrongfully kills an individual,
the whole group is to be killed in qisa~ according to the most preponderant
opinion adopted by the Muslim scholars (may Allah have mercy on them).
This opinion is based on the general meaning of the Qur'anic verse in which
Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"O you who have believe.ii, prescribed for you is legal retribution
for those murdered... Atl!d there is for you in legal retribution
[saving of} life, 0 you {p,eople] of understanding, that you may
become righteous:•
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 178-179)
The aforementioned opinion is also the one unani mously maintained
by the Prophet's Companions. To illustrate, Sa' id Jbnul-Musayyab reported
that 'Umar Ibnul-l<hattiib (may Allah be pleased with him) had killed seven

opinioh, and tbeywould kill a group of people In retiibution for killing one
person; there was none who disagreed With them, so there was a consensus
on this juristic view,
In this respect, the great Muslhn scholar Ibnul-Qayyim (may Allah have
mercy on him) said: "The Compa11fo11s and the majority ojfaqihs 1manimously

qgree 011 tf,e ruling t/mt ngro11p ofpfople are Ip ~e killed (in rettibrltion) for killing
one person, though it may appear to co11tradfcl tire basic principle ofqi14 1ll1111ely
smffng oflfves. They maintain so as not to let the 11011-opplication of the qifdi to a
group uf 11mrderers be the prt!lext for further conspiracy to sht!d blood!''
Moreover, lbn Rushd (Averroes) sajd: "The wisdom behind the application
of t/ie qi1,c1f/or mw•df!r is to a void/11.tlher murder as stated in the Q11ri111. Th11S, if
a group ofco,~pirators is not killed in retribution for killit,g a11 individ11al people
will band together in killirig. A11ot/,er reason is that retaliation and deterrence
are not iJllnmed except //mmgh ki/li11g al/ the murderers (111 qiiaa).""
In thi& regard, a group of murderers is killed for killing an lndividll'11
provided the action of each member of the group is fatal. In other wot'ds.. to
kill thrm all ln qi1a~ it i~ 11 cc;,ndition that all of them have participated in
killing the victim, and that the deed of each one of them has been enougli
to c~use death if done sep,trately, so eaGh of them is coosidet'ed a separate
murderer. Evert if the deedo,f each one of them is not separately fatal and tbey
have worked together in kiJJ:u1g the victim, the qi£OL namely kiUing them all,
is obligatory, as the indirect,;ctioru of mme of tbern have supported the direct
actions of the rest, resulting in the murder. Similarly, if a person is forced by
someone to kill another, it i:; obligatory to apply tbe qild~ for murder to both
of them (i.e. to kill both), th1! murderer and the one who compeUed him to do
it, provided the condiLio11s for the validity of fulflllfng the qi;,il~ are met. This
is because the murderer me~mt to preserve his own life by k,illing another, afld
the one who has compelled. him to do it has been the instigator and direct
cause of cettain death . However, if the nlllrder is committed by a minor or
an insane person due to the order of someone, only the latter, who has given
the order, is to be killed in qi£a~" 'Thi,s is because the murderer has just been a
tool used by such a person,.s:o the qi14I is .t o be applied only to him as.the real
cause of the murder, not to tl1e one used ;is a tool. 'Likewise, J the murderer is a
legally.accountable person (i.e. adult and sane) but unaware of the prohibition

of killing, sucb as those brought up ln 11011-J~lamic countries, the <Ji~ii! ls. to
be applied only to the instigator. It is not to be applied to the perpetrator due
10 his ignorance of the prohibition of killing, so the qi~il~ is npplied to the
real cause of the murder, namely the instigator. On the other hand, if the Ont
ordered to murder is a leg;illy acc,ountable person and aware of the prohibition
of killing, fhen the qi~~ is to be applied IO him as well, 36 he has committed
fhe murder without right. fn this regard, the Prophet (PBUH) says, "Na persa11
is ta be qbeyed in a m(ltler of dis,obedience to t'1e Crearor.•·' 'T'hls is the rule to
follow; whether the accessory is n ruler, a masrer or whoever. Moreover, the
one who enjoins such deeds oC dii;obedience to Allah should,be discretionarily
punished according to what the Imam of Muslims (the ruler or the qne ln
authority) jl1dges. This is becalise such aa accessory is conr.idertd to have
committed an act ofdisobedience to Allah, so he has to receive a discretionary
punishment as a means of determnce.
Furthermore; if two persons c:oaspired and premeditatedly killed someone
unjustly, and one of the two doei: not meet the conditions for the application
of the qi,~ it is to be applied only to the othe1· one who meets them (1.e. he
is to be killed in </i5.ilJ.), as he hat; partidpated in a murder intentlonolly and
wrongfully. Thal is., the q!¾af for 4nurder, namely c<1pital punishment, 'is not tu
be applied to his pru'tner due to the nb~·ence of the clinditions obligating the
qfa(IJ on him, not due to absen~ of the reason for the qiitJ,, Accordingly, the.
({ii~ i~ to be applied to the one 1~110 meets the conditions•obligating it. In (his
connection, if someone holds a person for someone else lo kill, the killer is to
be killed in qiflif, and tbe other, who bas held the victim for hiin, is to be glven
life imprisonment.
'Fhe ruling applied to the grt~up killing an individual is the same r.uling
appli!!.d ln,thecase ofinjuries to pa,rts of the body and wounds caused bya groop
to an 'Jndivid'ual'. To clarify, if a group of people pattlcipates in damaging or
culling off a part of the body of n pe.rson or woundiag him, the qi.a,. (namely a
similar injury) is applied to every member of the group, provided their actions
in the crime are undistinguished. from one anot.her. Poe example, if they put
a piece of iron on the hand of a Jp6rson and be.gin fo press heavily on it until
his hand is cut off. then the hands of them ail are to be cut off in qi~tl~. This is
based o.n the fact that two witne~;es c,mie to •AJ! lbn Ab(1 Ialib (may Allah be
plea.sed ,with him).and testified against someone th.at he had stolea. Thereupon,
•All ordered to amp~te the hand$ of the thief (as 11 prescribed punishment).
After that, they (the h\ro witnesses) came to him nlong with another pers<>n
and said, "'rhis i~ the real thief, ,as we were wrong concerning the first on~:'

tx Q@L5(LEGAL R\iTRIBUTJONl

'All Tbn Ab~ l\\lib rejected their testi111ony ~oncerning the second man and
obligated rhem to pay an indetnn!ty to the first, and said to them: •lfI thouglit
you had intentionally testified ,1gainst the first, I would have ampittated your
hanh." ; (This narration is related by Al-Bukhari in a mu'allaq'' furm and
related by others as weU) 'Fhi6 incident indicates that the q~a~, namely cutting
their hands off, would have been applied if they had intentionally testified
against the man. This is also supported by analogical deductioi1 regarding the
case when a group of people kills an individual, in which case the ~~ is
killing the murderers. The qi~a~ is estin1ated according to the consequence
of the offense, whether ,he .consequence is death or a minor result. This is
because the resulting effect ofan offense is the actual crime. To fllustrate, if
someone cuts off a finger of llllother, and the wound causes other fingers or
the entire hand to be cut off(due·to gangrene forexample), then the similar
hand of the offender is to be cut off in qiitli., not just n, finger. Moreover, .if the
injury spreads to I.he rest, ofihe body until it causes the death of the victim, the
perpetrator is to be killed jn q¼.~ for murder.
fl i5 impermi&bible to apply the qi1.111 for an injury or a wound before it heals
to verify that there is no further damage. This is due to ihe hadith narratedby
Jiibir (nia)' Allah be pleased ,o/ith him) in whidi he said:

'i\ man w,u wounded. and lie wanted qii_a~ to be applied t't) ·the
offender. However, the Prophet (PBUH) forbade applying q{Iti~ to
the culprit until the wounded person was wholly recovered,' '
(Related by Ad-D/iraqutnt and other compilers of liaditli)
'fhis is surely in the best jnterest-of the victim, as it verifies that the wound
will neither affect the functton of any other part of the body nor cause death.
Therefore, if the clohner opposes this ruling and exacts the qi~di before he
wholly reoovers, and then his wound spreads ond affects another pad of the
body. he has no righlto seek any kind of qii~ for the effects of the injury. In this
regard,· Amr Ibn Shu' ayb, on rhe authoriry of his father and his grandfather
respectively, narrated:

':4 .man stabbed another in his knee with a horn, so the injuted 11141'1
came to the Prophet (PBUH) and said, 'I want to apply the qiiJii
(i.e. to cause 11,e offenefef an equal injury).' The Prophet (PJJUH)
said to him. 'Only whe11 you are re,covered.' Then the man came
again (before recovery) and said, 1 want to apply the qi~~· So, tlte

that. the man came to the Prophet arid said. 'O Messenger ofAllah!

(ReTated by Imam Ab.mad and Ad-D~raqutnl)
Hereby. Muslims come to know the virtues of i:heir'Shari 'ah (Islamic Law)
and realize the perfect justice and the btoad mercy it en<:ompasses. Trne are

Diyah (Blood Money)
D/ya/1 (blood money) is the money paid by the offender to the victim or
his legal representative as legal compensation.

Its Ruling
Diyah (blood money) is obligatory according to Allah's Book, the Qur'an,
the Su1111ah (Prophetic Tradition) and the consensus of Muslim scholars. Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
".. . And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the freeing ofa
believi11g slave and a compensation payme11t [diyah] prese11ted
to his [i.e. thedeceased's)famify..."
(Qur'an: An-Nisa': 92)

Moreover, it is stated in a 1ab.ib. b.adith that the Prophet (PBUH) says:
"He whose relative is murdered has to choose one of two ways; either
to accept the diyah (blood money) or execute the qi~a~."
(Related by the Group of Compilers of Hadith)

IX QIS.AS (I.EGAI. RETRIBUTION)

552

Heoot. lhe ,liylllds oblig;1tory to be paid by whoever kills a person directly.
such as hitting a person or running over him by a car. The same applies when
oae is a cailllative factor in llilling another, such as digging a hole on the road.
or blocking it With a stone causing 11notl1er'.s death, whetller the victim is a
Muslim, Ohimmi,' one of a people who are not Muslims' enemies. or one ofa
people engaged in o peace treaty with Muslims. J'his is because Allah, Exalted
be He, says:

•;..And If he wus from a people with whom you have a treaty
- tlit1i a co111pe1u11t/on payment presented lo his family..."

(Qur'an: ¾t-Nisa': 92)

Diyah (Blood Money) for Premeditated Murder
Jf the mµrd er i,s intentionally committed. tbe diyalt is to be paid frgm the
killer's own money, ns rhe original rule states thnt the compensation for an
offense is obligatory to be paid by the offender. In thi& regard. Al-Mtiwaffaq
Ibo Qud:l:mah said:
''Miulim scholars u11anlmo11s/y agree that the·diy,1hfor premeditate,(
murder is obllgat01y to /,e take11.from the murde,-eil we~th according
to,tlie o_rigi11al rule, not to be ft.aid by tire perpefrator's agnaterelatives.
Allah, Exalted be He, says, '... And 110 bearer of burden$ will bear
theburdenofnnother...' (Qur'a:n: Al-An' am: 164)"'

However, tltls original rule - that the diyah is to be paid from the perpetrator's own money - is inapplicable tn the case of manslaughter. This is
because cases of mamlaughrer recurrently happen and the. amount of diyah
for killing :r l\uman being is very Jru·ge. Thus, it would be unfair if the offender
had lo pay it alone. Therefore, wisdom necessitates that such a large amount
of diyah is to be pald by the offender's agnate relatives as a means of helping
and supporting the offender. and a way of relieving him as his case is excusable.
l:fowever. in tile case of premeditated murder, the murderer has no excuse for
his cri'me, so he· deserves no commutation of penalty; rather, killing him as
qi1.'11. (legal retribution} ls applicable to him. Yet, if the premedhator murderer
is pardo1.1ed by th.e deceased's family or legal rep;e,sent-1tives, i.e. th~y decide
nut to kill bltn in retnliatlon, he is 10 be burdened by paying the diyal, alone,
without his relatives' support, as a means of redeeming his life. Thus, the diyali
becomes obligatory for bim to pay, just like the obligation of paying indemnity
for damages.

Chapc« 5 1 Dt-,,,h \Blood Money)

Diyah for Quasi-premeditated Murder and Manslaughter
The diyah in these two cases is to be paid by the perpetrator's agnate relatives.
To illustrate, Ab0 Hurayrah (may Allal1 be pteased with_him) narrated:,

"Two ,women from (the tribe·of) Hudhay1 fought·wi'lh eat11 other and
one ofthem hit t/,e other with a stone t/1111 killed both her and the
Jetus she carries. 1:he killer's ag11ate relat£11es ai1d those ofthe victim
s11bmitted their case to the Pniphet (PJ3UH) 1<1ho jlfdged that tha diyah
for t/1efttus was a male or female slave, and that for the m11rdered
wom,111 wus to be paid by th'e murderer~ agnate relati11es."
(Related by Al-Bukhari ancll Muslim)
This hadtth indicates that' the diyah for quasi-premeditated mllJ'der is to be
pa.id by the family ofthe offende1r.
Concerning the diyah for manslaughter, lbnul-Mundhir said:

"All the juristic stlioiars, on whose rulings we rely, unanimously t1gree
that the diyalr (blood money) for ma1tslt11!ghter is lo be paid by the
, o.;the perpe,rrator..,,
ngnate reIahves
1
Moreover, AfaMuwaffaq said!.
"We are riot acq11ai11ted wil'.1/-·any disagreerrtl!Jlt among scholars on
the fact that It (i.e. the diya.h for m,wslattghter) Is to be paid lly the
agnate relatives of the perpe:tmtor."'
The ~ e ruling also applici; to the cases similar to manslaughtei:; suoh
as f.illing on someone while asleep ~nd killing hilll, digging a well or a hole
excessively where someone falls therein and dies., ,ind suchlike cases.
However, the diya/1 is not rnquired when killing is the .result of legally
permissible matters, such as di~ciplirte artd the like. For f!Xainpk, if a man
\alls his wife or son while disci.plining them, or if a ruler kills any of his
subjects wbile disciplining him, tthere is no diyah lmposed on the killer. This
is bec:;1us~ <!lscipline is a legaliy permissible deed, provided the killer has not
been excessfve nor has lie transgressed the customary limits while disciplining
them. Otherwise, if there is exc,:ssive.ness or transgression and' death is the
result, ,then the diyah is to be paid.
In this concern, ifdisciplioinJ~ a pregnant woma,1 causes her abortion, the
perpetrator is to p.1y the diyah fi)r killing the fetus, namely giving a male or
remale slave as diyah. This is due to the b.nditlt recorded io the Two ]ia/1111.s'

IX Qis,4£ (LEGAL RETRIBUTION)
\;''hich sto.tes Lhat the Prophet (l'BUH) gave fhe judgment that a male or female
slave is to be given as the diya/1 for G\using a womans abortion' . This ls the
opinion adopted by the majority of scholars.

If may !iappen that someone scores n pregnaqf womaq that call5es her
abortion, as when a mighty ruler summons her or when an enemy of hers
turns people of higb of authority agaimt her. In such cases. the doer is liable
for the diya/1 for killing tbe fetus, as lhe doer is.the main cause for its des:th. To
exemplify. 'Umar fhnol-F;'.h11u~b. the great Muslim canpl\, sent for a woman

whose husband was abstut and thtre were some 'People who used to vis1t her.
Thereupon, she said:

"Woe to me( W/ty does 'Umar se!ldfor me?" On her way to 'Umar.
//eing scared at lite idea of 111eeli11g him, she suffered from lhe throes

her (by s1mm1011[11g lier) so sh~ gave birth to him untimely: •'
Furthermore, whoever orders a legally accountable person to descend a
well,climb a tree, or the like,/llld that person falls down anddieswbile fulfilling
the order, the former is not liable for any diyah, as he has done him neither
wrongdoing nor transgression. Yet, lf the victim is not a le.gaUy accountable
person, then the person who has ordered him is liable for the diyah, as he
is the cause of the victims death. fn addition, if a person hires someone to
descend a well oc dimb a tree for example and that hired person dies during
performing the task1 rhe hirerwill not be liable for any diyah, as there is neither
transgression nor .assault on bis part. Similarly; whoever hires someone to dig
him a well lo his hQuse and t!te l1ired person dies du.e lo an accidental collapse
11ot caused by anyone, the hirer will not be iiable for anything, :is there is no
transgression on his part.
Mence, ,~e reaJ]ze to what extent Islam fakes an interest in the preservation
of iives and tbe prevention of bloodshed. 'Nevertheles.~ c.irelessness and
negllgence have become so widespread nowadays l:bat some people drive
heedlessly and recklessly endangering their lives as well as the lives of others.
Many an innocent soul is destroyed as a result ofsuch heedlessness! Nowadays,

Chapter 5: Diynh (Blood Money)

the death of an entire group of pe,ople or a whole family can simply be caused
ar the hands ofa youth driving his car recklessly and irresponsibly wirhou1 the
least consideration of the consequences. Unfortunately; the p;u-ents of sueh
heedless yo11th and teens may be the cause of such tragedies, as they buy them
,lull'urlous cars as if urging. them to destroy innocent lives. In this way, such
parents give tlwir children fatal wi?:apons to phty with, playing with the live~ of
Innocent people, aiusing them panic as wdl.
Those people have lo fear Allah conreming the way they bring up thcir
children in their bes\ it1terest, safoguarqins their liy~ and the live~ pf otheN,
Moreover, those Tn authority ha~•e to dete-r whoever deserves deterrence to

Amourlts of Diyah
(Bloo,d Money)

An amount of diyah differs on !oasis oflslam, freedom, gender, and whether
the murdered human is existent or still a fetus. The greatest amount of diyah
is the amount paid for killing a Muslim free man; it is a thousand mithq(l/s'
of gold, twelve thousand dirhams (Islamic dirhams of which every ten equal
seven mithqals of gold).' a hundred. camels, two hundred cows, or two thousand
sheep. This is according to the i1ad:ith related by Abu Dawud on the authority of
JAbir (may Allah be pleased with him) that goes:

"The Messenger of Allah (Pl!UH) gave judgment that the diyah to
be paid by those possessing camels is one hundred camels, by those
possessing cows is two hundred cows, and by those possessing sheep
is two thousand sheep."'

lX QIS,A:i (LEGAL RETRIBUTION)

In adilition, ' fkrfmah re,ported on the authority of !bn ' Abbas,
'j,\ man was killed and 1:lrcMesse11ger l!fAllah (PBUH) gave11ulgme11t
,1l,at the diya/1 to be-pa:id was twelve thousand dirhams.A 1

(R£lated by Abu D~wi1d and Jbn Majah)

Moreover, it is-stated in the letter the Prophet [PllUH) gave to · Amr lbn li32Jll:
''One thousand dinars are to be paid (as diyah) by the people

possessing gold."
(~elated by An-Nasii'f)
Scholars disagree as to which of the aforeu1e11tioned types should be
regarded as the original type of diyq/,, i.e. the sufficient onec In other words,
they disagree regarding l"hil:h type the guardian of~ killed person is obliged to
accept1f the dlyah is paid in. According to some schdlars, the victim's giiardian
i5 obliged to accept whatever type of 1he above-mentioned diyah. regardless of
wherher theguardiall is originally a possessor of that type or not. as long ,15
lhe payer bas fulfilled his obligation, A second opinion, which is the judgment
maintaioed by the majority ofscholars, stipulates that only c.101els are the main
type to be paid as diyah. They base the ii' opinion oo the following two hadiths,
the Prophet (PBUH) said:

"(Thediyah)for (killin,g) 11 bcliel'ing soul (i,e. person) is one hundred
C(llllels."
.And,

"Verily, the diya/1 for quasi-premeditated murder is one hundred
camels;"

Abu Ddwiid also related thot ' Umar ,fbnul-Khattab (may Allah be pleased
with bim) once delivered a i1em10n and said:

"Camels /Jave become dear,' ' so he decreed that the diyah to be paid
by those possessinggold is or1e thousand di,uus, • by those possessing
silver twelve thousarids, by those possessing cows 11110 /tu11dred
cows, by those possessing sheep two tf,ousa11d sheep, ruid by those
possessing garments two hundred garments.'''
Since the Messenger of Allah (]'BUH) was strict concerning the _payment
of came.ls as diyq/t in cases oJ pre1ueditated murder and 11•~s lenienl fn this
l'eg;ud in cases of n1anslaughter, then camels are th~ original rype to 'be paid
-as diyah; this is al.so t:he opinion upon which scholars unanimously .igreed. in

aforementioned type.~of diy,.1/i are subsidiuq ~od dependent on estimation.

In cases of preJnedilated and quasi-ptemeditated murder.;, the dijiah of
camels, wbich are one hundred camels, are pald exactly by being divided into
four parts; twenty five one-year-old she-camels, twenty five two-year-old shecamels, twenty five three-year-old she-camels, and twenty five four-yeat-old

So, ifthe payer of diyah pays it in thlsfushion, the guardfan of the murdered
person is obliged io accept it. Moreover, the payer can pay the value of each of
the four .groups of camels according to their estimated price ifbe likes.
As regards manslaughter, the diyall is ·no_! that strict; the hundred camels
are divided into fiv~ gi·oups: twenty one-year-old she-caq1els, twenty two-yearold she-camels, twenty three-year-old she-camels, twenty four-year-old sheaunels, and twenty one-year-old he-camels, or the value of'tl\ese five gtoUps
according to the"ir estimated price.

The diyah to be paid for killing a free man ofthe·People of the Sciiptµre
(the Jews and the Christians) equals half the diy11h paid for killing a Musllm,
\le l'le a Dhimmt, one of a people who are not Muslims' enemies, or one of a
people engaged iii a peace tieaty with Muslims. This ruling is based on the
following !!ad/th narrated by ' Anir Ibn Shu' ayb on the authorityof h.is fafher
and h.is grandfatherrespectlvely:.

"Tile Messenger ofAllah (PBUH) gave judgment that the diyah for
(killing one of) tile People of t/1e Scripwre is half the diyah paid for
(killing) a Muslim:••
{Related by fmam Ahmad, AhO Dawt'ld, and other compilers of tJadlril)
The diyah paid for killing a magus is eight hundred Islamic dkhams' (o(

11
which every ten equal :seven mithqals ' of gold), be he a Dhi,mni, one ofa
people who ~re not Muslims' enemies, or one of a pe.ople engaged tn a peace
treaty with Muslims. This judginentis based on the foUowing marf,i •(traceable)
l!adith reported by lbn 'Adiyy on t.he aut.h9rity of ' Uqbah lbn ·• Amir (m-.iy
Allah be pleased wi.th him) th~t the Prophet (PBlJH) said:
''Tire diyah paid for !cillinga Mngl is eight hundred dirhams."12
This is the opinion maintained by most scholars.

IX QIW (LEG.AL RETRIBUTION)

560

The diyah paid for killing a female Jew, Christian, Magi. or Pagan is half
the diyah paid for tjieir males, just like the dfyah paid for killing a Muslim
woman is half the diyah paid for k!lling a Muslim man. lbnul-Mund!w' said
in this connection, "Scholars unanimonsly agree that {he diyah paid for killing a

Muslim ll'Oman cqut1ls half the dift1h paid for killing a Muslim man. It is stated
in the letter the Prophet(PBUH) ga,1e to 'Amr Tb11 Hazm, "The diya1i paid for
killing a woman fs half the diyali paid for killing a mar1.""

Tbe great Mu5lim scholaf' lbnul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on hin1) said:
''Women are JtOt ,equal to me11 and ore 11ot as beneficial as men are,
Men can asmme religious offices, assume gut1rdianships, obsme
11ight watclling, perform the duty of jih/Jd (fighting in the Cause
of Allah), establish civilizations, perform crafts indispensable for
J,uman life, protect their people and preserve religion, unlike women..
Hence, the diyah paid far killir1g a wol'rlah is Hat equal to that ppid
for killing a m,m, Since women ore not equaLto me11, the Lawgiver"
•rendered a womanf diyah half a man's diyah.''"
In cases of wounds, the 1liyah of a woman is equal to that ofa man as long as
the legal amount to be paid is less than the third of th.e diyah for murder. This
is based on the marfit ' b.adlth narrated by ' Amr Ibn Shu ' ayb on !he authority
of his father and his grandfather respectively; ·the Prophet (PBUH) said:

'"f/ie dfyah (indemnity for a wound) of a woman is equa1 to that
of a man unless it does 110/ reach a third of the mans diyah (blood
',."
money1,
This b.adith was related by An °Nasa'1, and the ruling therein was stated as
S111111ah (Prophetic Tradition) by Sa ' 1d 11;,nuH\fusayyab.

Ibmi.1-Qayyim also said,

"Although Ab4 tianifali, Ash-Shdfi 'i, a11d other$ dis<lgm, wit/t that

rs made equal w that of a mar~ not halfof it, as Jong as it is-less than
the third of the amo1m1 ofthe man's diya/1 in case of murder; so that
a woman may be compe"$ated sufficiently. For this same reason, the
diyali p11id for killing a fetus, male or female, is the same because
the diyah of a fetus is already so Uttle. The same ruling on Jeruses is
applied to the value of diyaii for a womans wound as lo11g as it ,lots
not reach one third of the mans diyah for a murder.""

The diyah for a serf is equal his/her worth, be fhe serf& rnale or a female-,
a child or an adult, with no maxi1num amount, as long as it does not eJ(Ce(<d
a free man's diyah, as scholars unanimously agree. However, Ahmad, M~lik,
Ash-Shafi· i, and Abti Yusuf maintain that a serf's diyalr Is e11ual his/bee worth,
even if it exceeds the diya~ of a free man.
lf a pregnant woman is assaulted and sh~ has suffered abortion asa result,
tbe diyah for the dead fetus, beit male or female, 'isaghurrali, which isa child
male or female serf whose value is estimated as five camels. This isaccordin.g
to the !iadtth narrated by Abi'.\ Hurayrah (may All.ah be pleased with him)
that states:
"The Messenger of Allah ('PBUH) gaw the judgment that a ghwTalt
i~ tq be given (as diyah) for a11 abortjon case of(I womQtt_from (t}1e.
tribe of) Bom'.i Labycln," "

(Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim).
Accordi11g to ,the majority of scholars., that glutrmh (the serf or the five
camels). which equals oni: tenth of the diyah (blood money) pald for killing
a woman, is inherhe<l by the dead fetu~• legal heirs, because it ls the diyah for
its murdt:r.

Diyah (Indemnity) for Body
Organs, Senses and Functions

First: Diyah (Indemnity) for Organs
Some scholars aver that there are forty-five organs in the human body.
Some of these organs are unique, others are in pairs. and some are more than
two parts. Ha unique 01,gan, such as the nose, the tongue, or the male organ,
is damaged, diyah (indemnity) for it equals the diyah (blood money) paid if
the injured person was murdered. Therefore, the amount of diyah is estimated
on the previously defined basis, whether the injured person is male or female,
free or a slave, Muslim or not. This is because damaging a sole organ that Allah
has created unique damages the entire function of that organ. This is what
makes it similar to murder, hence deserving diyah equal to that paid in cases
of murder as agreed upon by all scholars. It is stated in the letter the Prophet
(PBUH) gave to 'Amr lbn Jjazm:

564

IX QJ~.{S tLEGAL RETRl~IJTION)

"The male org,m (if ,r:ut off or wholly damaged) necessitates the
total amo11nt of d{ya/1 (blood monejl; and (similarly) the nose,
if cut off or wholly damaged, necessitates the total amount of
diyali; and (similarly) tlie tongt.ie necessitates the total amount
ofdiyah."
(Related by Ahmad , An-Nasa·~ and deemed ~al!ill (authentic) ty,dftli
by Ahmad, lbnl:[ibba,o, Al-Hakim, and AI-Bayhaqi)
As for the body organs existillg in pairs, they are, for example, the eyes,
the ears, the lips, the jaws, die breasts, the bands, the arms, the legs, and the
testicles, ff the pa.ir of organs is damaged, tb.e tolal amount of diyah is to be
p~d; if one of them i.s damage,;!, half the diyaf, is to be paid, because thefr
importance lies in their fumctlun, aesthetic value, and the f.act that there are
mil.y two of them in the bod)', AI-Muwaffaq said that theie was not a single
1
scholar who disagreed on tl~at ruling ,
II js stated in the lettt'r t·he Prophet (PBUH) gave to ' Amr lbn Hazm:

''The nose, if cut off or wholly damaged:, t1ecessitates the total
amount of r/iyah (bloor/ 111oney); and (similm•ly) the tongt1e
(ifcut off or wholly damaged) necessitates t/Je total amou11t of
diyah; and (sfmf/arly) t11e lips· necessitate the tot'al amount of
,tiyah; and (similar~~) t'he resticles necessitate the total amount
of diyah; a11d (slmi,l<1rl)') the backbone necessitates the total
amount of diyah; a111d (sim/lnrly) the eyes 11ecessitate the total
amount of diyah; a11d (similarly) one leg 11ecessit(l.tes half'the
rota/ amount of Jiyr1l1."

Ibu 'Abdul-l!arr (may Allah have mercy on him) said. "The letter Wrirtai
(by tiie Prop/wt) to 'Amr Tim Ha2111 is well-k11ow11 to scliolal's. Its contents are
agreed 11po11, with a few exc,eplfons." '
As for the human bod11 organs consisting of three parts, if the three are
damaged., the total amount of diyah (blood money) is to be pald, and if one is
damaged, one third of the diyab is to be pa.id, and so on. Por ""'~ mple, a nose
consists of three parts,, namely two nostrils and tl:te cartilage ·tha1 separares
them; the diyah is divided among the three of tbem.
Regarding the body organs consisting of four part.s, if the four are damaged,
the total ,1mount of diya/1 (lb.lood mo11ey) ls to be pttld. Ifonly•one of the four

Cbaptor Y: Diyah (lrulemnicy) fi>r Bodi, Orpns, Sen... and Iiunorio!l"

565

organs ls damaged, one-fourth o:fthe d{ya/1 is to be paid. The four eyelids are
an example of such organs; lf the four eyelid$ are damaged, the total amount of
diyah is to be paid. This is because the eyelids have an aesthetic value and an
important function. as they cove,r the eyes and protect them against hot and
cold weather. So, a quarter of the' total arno1111t ofdiyah Is to be paid if one of
them is damaged, and so on.

If the ten fingers or the ten toes are cut off, the total amount of diyal, Is
to be paid. The indemnity for ea,cb finger or toe equals one-tenth of the total
amounl of diyali. Ibo "Abbas narrated (in a marju• liadith) that the Prophet
(PBUH) said:

"The i11demnity to be paid 1in case fhe fingers or the toes are cut off
~ equal; ten camels for eaiJ,finger ur toe.•'

(Related aQd d~med ~ab.lb. (authentic) by At-Tinriidht)
Al-BukhAtl also rel;tted on tbe authority of fbn 'Abb~ that the Prophet
{PBUH) said:
"This and that (referring to the little finger and the .tlmmb) are the
same (concerning the due d'/yah}." '

'those two narrations show that itis obligatory to pay the.diyah (indemnity)
in case of damaging (or cutting off) any of the ffngen; or the toes; one-tenth of
the total amount of diyah iii te be! paid for each.
The diyah (indemnity) for each knucklebone of a finger or a toe is ooec
third of-a tenth of the total amoqnt•of diyah (approximately 3.3%). Since each
finger has three·knucklebones, the diyah for each nnser is divided among.the
three knucklebones. Silllilarly, since a thumb has only two knucklebones, the
dlyah for each is half the teoth of the toral amount-of cliyah (i.e. 5%), and the
same applies ,to the toes.
The diyah for each tooth is h,¼lf the tenth of the total amow1t of diyah, t.e.,
f)ve ,aunels. In a ,narfii' hadith, 'Amr lbn Bazm narrated that the Prophet
(PBUH} said:
'"Fi11e ,amels are to be paid '(as.indemnity) for a tooth.~

(Related by An-Na&A'I)

A.1-Mnw«.q commented, "T.l1ere is no disagreement an-tongscholars on the
fact that the indemnity for each tooth Is five carnets.•'

566

IX QISAs_ (LEGAL RETRlBU'fJC>N)

Second: Diyah (Indemnity) for Functions
The word ''functioru;" liere refers to the functions of the aforementioned
Organs, Stich as hearing, sight, smell, speech, movement, etc., due to the fad
(hat each organ has a specific functi,;>tJ. Thus, dte four senses, namely hearing,
sight, smeU, and taste, are among the body functions. If any ope of them
is damaged, the total amount of diyah is to be paid in compensation. "The
majority ofscholars agree that•the total amo1(nt ofdiyah Is ttJ be paid if the sense
ofliearing is damage,;/,''r. said JbnµJ, Mtmdhlr. Al-Muwaffaq also said, "There is
no juristic disagreement 011 the obligation ofpayiltg the total amoimt ofdlyah in
compens"tion for damaging someone~ tense ofhearing."' It is stated fn the letter
lhe Prophet {PBUH) gave to 'Amr lbn Hazm:
"The total Ql'/'/0ur1t of diyalj is to be paid for damaging someo11e's
sense ,ofsmell."

D uring the reign of · Umar lbnul •Kha,tt~b (may Allah be pleased with liim),
a man ~eat another until the latter lost his hearlng, sight, sanity, and his abiliry
to copulate. As a result, ' Umar passed a judgment that four amounts of tliefotal
amount ofdiyah were to be paid to that man (Le. his guardian). ftfsnot//WOrthy
that none of the Companions objected to that Judgment passed by ·umar.
The total amow1t of diya/1 is to be paid for each of these functions, t1ucli
as damaging someone:S faculty of speech, power of reason, ability to walk,
ability to cat, ability to copulate, ability to control urinating or excreting. This
is because each of these functions is of a gre.it benefit for man that it could not
be compensated.
Damaging the hair of the four parts of ,the body (namely the hair of the
he.ad,.t he beard.. the eyebrows, and the eyelashes) obligates paying th¢ total
amount of diyah (blood money) in compensation for each. If one eyebrow is
damaged, half the total amount of diyn/t is to be paid. If the hair of one line of
the eyelashes is damaged. a quarter of the total amount of diyah is to be paid·,
because the diyali js divided among !11" four lines of eyelashes.
'1:hls draws attention to the foci lhat Islam greafly respects and ho11Qrs a
m~n•s be.trd. This is why damaging a beard necessitates the payment of t;he total
amount of diy11l1. A man's beard is dignified ,thanks to its function, aesthetic
value, and the solenmity it gives lo one's appearanc.e. The Messenger of Allah
(PBUR) enjoined Muslims to grow their beards and groom them welL He
(PBUH) prohibited Muslims from shaving their beards or cutting them short.

Chapter 7: D,'yt,h (lndcmoicy) for Body Organs. Sense,,and Function,

Therefore, woe to those who tran5:gress byshavlng their beards; they thus topylhe apJ?earance of women, disbe:lievin,g people and tiypocrites, ,and gi'l~ up
their manliness to effeminacy. This is why a poet said:
~Ma11 at times of111oral affliction

May see 111h,1t is ugl)' as pcrfect/011"
Men who follow this attitude should come to reaso;,. reconsider tlieir
conduct,and obey the Messenger c,f Allah (PRUH), who ordered Muslim men w

grow their beards thnt Allah creau:d for them as signs of beauty and manlin~.

Diyah (I1ndemnity) for
Wounds and Fractures

A-Wounds
Ancient Arabs defined ten kinds of face and head wounds; each of them
has its own name and ruling concerning diyah (indemnity).

I-Abrasion: Injury that causes the skin to be scraped without bleeding.
2- Scarification: Injury th at causes shallow cuts in the epidermis with
little bleeding.
3-Flesh-cutting wound: Injury that causes both the epidermis and the
flesh to be cut, but not so,deeply.
4-Deep flesh-cutting wound: Injury that causes the flesh to be deeply cut.

5-Non-periosteous wound: Injury that canses1:he skin to be so deeply
cut that it.is about to reach the periosteum fthe dense fibrous membr;me
covering the surface of bones).
These five kinds of wounds do not have fured llinounts of diyah stated
by the La,~giver. Rathe.r, diyalr is left to the estimation of the judge,
jurist, or the one in legal authority.

6 -Bone-clearing wo,md: lnjl.lJ'Y i~\ which Jhe wound is so deep that the
bone is 11ncovered. The diyah for this wound ls five camels, for •Arm
fbn Hnzm narrated that the Prophe,t (PBUH) said:

"five camels are to lie paid (as indenmity)for a bone-clearing wound."
7 • Bone-breaking wo,uod: Injury in which the bone is both uncovered
and broke!l. The diyah for thfs kind of wound is ten camels as
maintained by Zayd.ibn Thabit ( may Allah be pleased with him)' and
no one of the Prophet's CompaniollS was known to have questioned
the verity of this ruling.

8-Bone-breaking-~l.nd-dislocatipgwound: Injury in wbich the
wound causes the loones to•be uneovered, broken, and dislocated
so that a bone· wrn.ild need to be both relocated and splinted.
The diyah for such a wound is fifteen camels. It Is stated in the
Jetter written bytb.e Prophet (PBUl-f) to ' Amdbn Hazm that he
(PBUH) said:

"Fifteen camels ,1re to .be paid (as indemnity) for a bo11e-breaki11g-anddislocating wou11d."
9-Skull- fracturing -wound: Injury thnt reaches the outer cover of
the brain.
I0-Brain WOWld: lnju,.y in which the layer covering the brain is penetrated.
11he (iiyalt (lndemn:ity)· for the last two &yPes of wounds equals one
third of the total amount of diyah (blood money), This is because
' Amr Iba Haun narrated that the Prophet·( PBUH) said,

•o,:e third ofthe tot,~/ amo1111r, ofdij'ah fblo()d 1rioney) is to bepaid ( as
indemnity) for a sku 11-fractw·lng wou,rd."
Since a brain wound is more serious, and can hardly be survived, no
cerll!in indemnity was specified for it, as it usually leads to death.

C hopu:r8: Dip/1 (Indemnity~ fo r Wound, a11d Pr:i,rurc,

For·a wound that readies the inner part of the heac.l (or the abdomen,

Indemnity is also one camel for each of the two clavicles' . ,Tt was narrate~ that
' Umar Jbnul-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with hi.m) sa id:

"The iliycth (indehwit)') for (breaking) a rib is one earner'. The

diyah for a clavicle is one camel""
However, if ,1 rib or 11 d av-lcle does not heal p roperly, a juristic assembly is
to be held to estimate the proper diya/1 to be paid.

If an arm, foreann, I.high, leg, or wrist is broken and heals properly. the
indemnity for- it is two camels. Sa' id narrated on the authority of 'Amr Tbn
Shu·ayb:

"'Amr lb11ul- 'Ai (may Allah be pleased wiih him) wrote to 'Umar
lbm1/-Kl111t1ilb asking him iibout the legal diyah (indemnity) for a
broken forearm. ' Umar answered Mm that the dfyah for it is 'two
camels, and four camels for breaking bot1, .foreaN}ls.•
In addition, none of the Companions disagreed on that ruling, T.n cases
of wounds 11nd fractures for which no ce,rt.ain sums of diynh (indemnity) 11re
spedfied, such as the spinal colump and pubis; the ,fiyah is ,to be estimated b)'
a jucistic assembly or the judge.

''The sourlrl opinion is tliai-tl,ere is t,o_iuristic esti11t11tlon (ofindemnity)

proofs, e.stimatio11 throu;g/1 juristic assembly (01· thej 11dgc} is obligatory

Scholars maintain that an estimated sum of compen&'alion for a kind
of a wound that afflicts a a,rtain body part must not exceed a fixed Sum of
compensation allocated fot a more serious wound in the Slime body part. That is
to say; t he amo,,mt of indemdity estimated by the judge to compensate a victim
for.a wound less serious than a bone-clearing wound must not exceed the fixed
indemnity paid in ~ase ofa ~one-clearing wound, which is five eamels.
If the victim completely recovers and suffers no complications, the dlyah
(indemnity) should be r,elroactively estimated on the basis of his state while
1njured, when his state ts wcortb diyah (indemnity) and his life is endangered

Expiation for Murder

Expiation is a coverage of and an atonement for sins. There are evidences
in the Qur'an, Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition), and consensus of Muslim scholars that expiation is an obligation. Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"And never is it for a believer to kill a believer except by
mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake - then the
freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment
[diyahj presented to his [i.e., the deceased's) family (is
required] unless they give [up their right as a) charity. But if
he [i.e., the deceased} was from a people at war with you and
he was a believer then [only] the freeing of a believing slave;
and if he was from a people with whom you have a treaty

tw() m()ntlas i:011sec11tively, [seeking/acceptance ofrepentance
from Allah. And Al'.lah is ever 1Cnowlng nnd Wise."
(Qur'an: An-Nisa': 92)
Abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i related that fhe Meuenger of Allah (PBUH)
said regarding a murderer:

"Free ,,:i slave for 1tim fi.a, for the mllrderer) so that Allah would
free for each part of his body (the freed .slaves lmdy) a part of the

murderers from the Ht:llfire.''
Expiation is an obligation only in cases of manslaughter and quasipremeditated murder. On the othet hand, no expiation is enjo_ined for
premeditated murder, for Allah says:
"But whoe1,er kills ,11 believer fµtentio,ially- his recompemc
is Hell, w11ei-ei1t he will ,wide etern,:il/y, a,ul Allaf1 has become

angry wttl, him and! has cursed Jtini and llas prepared for him
a gre,:it punishmei1t."
(Qur'aru An-Nisa'; 93)
There is nothing regarding expiation mentioned in thls case_
It was also related that Suwayd Jbnu~-Samit had intentionally murdered
a man, and the Mess,mger of Allah (PBUH) commanded that he should
be killed and did not obligate expiation in his c::a'Se. Also, when •Amr lbn
Umayyah A.d-Th!mn Intentionally mi:lrdered two men, the Messenger of
Allah (PBUH) ordered diyt1h (blood money) to be paid to their kinfolks,
and did ask · Amr Iba Umayyah to m;ike any expiation. The wisdom.behind
expiation is the alleviation of the .sin, as manslaughter in most cases results
from inattentiveness, unlike the major sin of premeditated murder, which is
too grav.c to be alleviated b)' eicpiation.

Shaykhul•lslam lbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) safd:
''No arpiation is enjoined for premeditated murder, nor i$ it for
perjury. And this is nol' commutation oftlie penalty to be Clpplied to
the silinet."'

Moreover, Muwaffaqud•JDln Ibn Qndamah etal. maintain that:
"Manslaughter mn r1dth,er be classified as n prahibited 11or permissible
act, for it Is j1L<t like the case of a murder committed by a d1m1c11ted
person, However, since it•(ir1a11sla~gltter) causes the e.1:piry ofa h1tma11
soul, which enjoys a state of simctity and pre.servatfon, expiation

becomes obligatory ;i, this C<!$C,.,"'

Chopt<r 9: Eltpiatlon for Murder

575-

.According to the above. the vvis<lom behind the prescription•of·expiation
for manslaughter lies in two pointsi

First: Manslaughter is alway~ rhe result of the murderer's negligence and
inattentiveness.
Second: Expiation is enjoined due 16 the sanctity of the human soui
exterminated.
As for premrditated murder, t,here 'is no ~xpiation called for in ·such a cas~,·
as expiation carulot alleviate such .a grave sln. Nevertheless, rem one. repentance.
-and giving oneself up to the aut'horilies for tetaliatlon, assuage n murde~r's
.sin. Hence, his duty towards All:i.h wfil be fulfilled through repentance. and
that towards the victim's guardians through retaliation, unless they grant him
forgiveness. Only the right of the victim remains unfulfilled and Allah would
compensate him in the way He pleases. This is the opinion maintained by lbnitlQayyim ln this regard, as st~ted in his A/-Jawab11l-Kafi ( The Sufficient Answer)'.

A person who commits man:;laughter against -1ny'iJ1viol~ble soul, even if
it was that ol a slave, a disbellever under a covenant with Muslims, or a fe:tu~
through assaulting its mother. must expiate for it. Allah, Exalted be !-le, says1
",., 11t1d whoever kills a .belie11er 1,y.Jhistake - tlien the freeing of
a bclie,•lng slave and II cocmpensation payment {diyah] presented
to his (i.e., the deceased;,] family [js requi~41 u.ri/ess they give
{up their right as a) tl1arl1ry. But ifhe [i.e., ,t he deceased} was from
'1 people at· war with you, anil he was a believer then [only} the
freeing afa believings/4v,1; artd lfl1e was from a people with wham

for two months consecutively, {seeking] acceptance ofrepenJance
from Allah. A11d Allah 1s 1!1ier Ki1owi11g aritl Wise."
(Qurian: An-Nisa': 92)

So, expiation is obligatory in manslaughter whether the murderer commits
It himself or with accomplices, directly or indirectly, as fn cases of digging
a big hole excessi vely and carel,essly, setting up a knife or a pointed thing
some.where, or committing .any such!Jkc tre.~passes thaf result in someone's
death. Al•Muwaffaq said:
•E,1cJ1 <'f t/ie accomplices (i fl mansltn~g/1ter) is o/Jliged lo expiatef or (t,
11s maintained by mosI sc/tol ars, among them are Mlllik; Ash-Shafi '1,
a11d,eill Scholars oj'lnterpret1we Op.inions."'

IX QIM~ (LEGAi. RETIUBUTION)

Aq:ording to the general! meaning of the aforementioned verse. expiation
for manslaughter is an obljgation on the murderer with no e,cceptlon, evell if
he was a minor, an insane pt:rson. or a slave_
The manne.r of expiation for manslaughter is freeing a believing Muslim
slave, or, if one cannot affo,rd emam:J,pation, observing fast for two months
consecutively, It is worth rrientioning here that the feedmg o( an adequate
number of underprivileged people is not a sufficient substitute for fasting.
So, 'if the mtttderer is unable to fast, 'his obligation of' expiation wilt remain
unfulfilled. This is becm1se Allah does not mention <111y a11b~tituk for e>.-pi~ti<m
in the verse., and the availabil.ity of alternative expiation depends on legal texts,
not on analogical deduction.

I.ii case the kiUer in ma,nslaug)lter is aq in~ane person or a minor, his
guardian is obliged to free a slave on his behalf. Tliis is because none of them is
qualified to observe f.-sting, 11,or is it permissible to observe failing on someone's
behalf. Thus, in case of man slaughter, expiation is an obligation on thes= two
incompetent persons (an iQsane percSon or a minor) because expiation is a
pecuniary duty like diya/4 oi• a pecuniary act of worship like Zalcah.
·E..xpiation 1s nece:.sitatedl for each manslaughter committed by the ,'lime
person., just like the case with diyah (blood money), However, it is noteworthy
that there are some coses ,in which kiUing is pe1missibl~, such 11s killing
a trespasser, an apostate, or an adulterer, in addifion to killing in c,.ses of
retaliation, retribution, and ,self-defense. In such cases; no expiation is called
for, because ,t here would be no sanctity for the murdered soul
ft l, important to point C>nt that people nowadnys,disregatd the expiation
for manslaughter, although many are killed in car accidents, It usually happens
that petpettators of manslaughter are reluctant to observe fasting, esp~cially if
they have to,expiate foi· more than one accident of manslaughter. Hence, their
duty of exp"iatio11 remains u11fulfilled. Moreover, it has become common that
the families of,the manslaughter perpetrators do not pay or ev~n share in the
legd.l d{jah, and those who Hhare in it regard it as a voluntary act of charil);',
Jt is no wonder then that SQme perpetrators of manslaughter ask for <lr.irity
io ,order to be able to pay th,: expiatory mone}', which hinders the fol6llroeril
of such a religious obligatio:n out of ignorance of such religious rulings. On
'the nther hand, some· swindlers may claim they ~re under debt to pay: their
expiatory money so that th!iY would unjustly get charity. Such frauds might
even support their Iles with illegal, forged, or outdated documents, so they
must be-severely deterred.

Qasamah (Cornpurgation)
Qasdmah (compurgalion) refiers to a number of oaths taken to clear someone from the accusation of murdering an in.n ocent person. Such procedure of
taking oath is to be followed when the body of a murdered person is found, the
identity of his murderer is not known, and someone in particular is suspected.
Evidence from the Swmah and the consensus of juristic scholars proves
the authenticity of this practice. l1t rs related in the Two S.ab,ib.s on the authority
of Sahl lbn Abu Hathmah,
"Both 'Abdullah llm Sahl and Mu/layyi£ah Jbn Mas ' ud set forward
to Khaybar. Then, Mub.ayyiiah found 'Abdullah Tbn Sahl while the
/qtter was bleeding profusely. Muhayyi~ah said to the Jews there,
'You have murdered him.' They said, 'No.' Then, (when 'Abdullah's
relatives went and informed Allah's .Messenger.) the Messenger of
Allah (PBUH) said to them 'Would you take an oath (that the
Jews did it) and be deserving ofyour kinsman's diyah?' (In an<llher

'Thett the fews are to dear themsetves (from the charge) by tak£11g

oaths ofa disbelieving people (referring to the fews)?' Finally, (to put
4n end to the dispute), fhe Messenger ofAllah (PBUH) ordered that
a hundred camels shou,ld be paid ( to the victim~ folks) as diya/1 for
the murdered."1
This badtth is an evidence that qasiimah is a legal procedure in Islam
a.nd th~t it is an independen,t part of Sahrfah (lslamic Law) and one of the
ptinciples oflegal rulings, which particulari.i e general proofi;,

The Conditions for QatSamal, (Compurgation)
1- Enmity

One of the most important conditions for qas4mnh is the q:isnmce
of manifest hostllity betwee:n the victin1 apd the suspect, like the case with
vindictive tribes or individuals leading lo likely suspicion., The kinfollcs of
the victim are then entitled to talce the oaths of anyone they 5uspect, even if
they were not eyewitnesses o,fthe crime. Sbaykhul-Isl4m lbn Taytnlyah ('may
>,llah have mercy on him) 1naintains that hostility (borne by the suspect to
the victim) is not tbe only factor considered in the case, but there are other
aspects that make the accusaltion likelier to be valid, sucli as a group of people's
departure from a certain plac:e leaving a killed person behind, the t~i4nony of
incompetent w1tnesses...et~

Imam Ahmad said:

"I resort to qaslimah if there is some lnadcqualc testimon)I if there
is a good reason for the accusatio11, if'there is hostility (between the
suspect and the victim), or if the suspect is notorious for committing
such a murder."'
Shaykhul-lsllm.lbn Ta}'!niyah commented on this saying:
'7mti.m Ahmad mentioned four reasons (for resorting to qasdmah);
the presence of witr/fjS,!S whose testimony fr itllldeqliate due to frl.
competenc:e, the existe11,:e ofu good reason fort/le accusation, such as

Chapccr I 0: Qd.IA.mnh (Compurgation)

581

a gror,p ofpeople~ deparmrefrom a certain place ieaving ·the victim
be/rind, the presence of hostillly betwee11 the ni.sped: and the yitrtim,
or the susp~ct s11otorio11Slless for connnittfng mr,rder. And rhese are
sour,d reasons."
•
lbnul-Qayylm (may Allah lia•ve mercy on him) also said:

"These are tire best bases of comp11rgat1on, as they rely on the
appqre_n t signs that s1,1pport t,l1e p/Qintiff~ a/legation ar,d,,accordingly.,
it becomes permissibl~ fodh e plaintiff to rake oat/is, Tl,e judge in this
case is entitled, or 1:atlrer o'bl(gated, to entitle the,plaintiff- in this case
tl-,e victim's nearest kinfolk- ,to retaliatio1t at 4iyal,, l'Ven though the
judge ktrows the plaintiff is -not an eye witness oftile crime."
The victim's kinfolks, however, must not take 011ths unless they are nearly
,ertain of their· -allegatioll. On t!he other hand, the judge must preach the
victitn's-kiofolkon the punishinent awaitihg those who commit perjury.

2- Legal Accountability
Among the c<>pditions for q,asamali is that the Sltspect must be legally
accountable; allegation canrtot be: made against a child:or an insane person.

3- Availability
1t is a condition thar lhe su:;pect mosr be able to have committed the
murder. Hence, if the 6Uspect has been far from the crime scene at the time
when it has been cocnntitted, the allegation is rejecled.

The Way Qastlmah (Comp•urgation) is Made
If the previously mentioned conditions ore fulfilled, the plltintiffs, the
victim'.s kinfolk6, are asked to take fifty oaths !'hat they believe a particular
person committed the murder. The share of each of them in the numO(,t of
oaths should be equal to their share in the vict1m's inheritance. The accused
person mnst be present during the taking -0f oaths. if the victim's Inheritors
abstaln from taking the fifty oaths or from compl~ting tl)em, the accused is
asked to take fifty oaths that he is innocent, provtded that the plaitttlffs accept
his t_aking 9f o~ths, If the accused per.;on completes the fifty oaths, then he
.Is deemed innocent. However, !Jf the plaintiffs do not agree to uie accused
person's taking of oaths, the judge must order th~ diyah to be pale.I from the
Public Treasury. This is because when the A~nr refused to let the Je.ws take
oaths, as mentioned above., the M:essenger of Allah ( PBUH,) ordered the .diyat,

IX 1<lsAS (LEGAL RETRIBtJTiON)

582

to 'be paid from the Public Treasury, as there i~ nofongcr any meant ofproving
the guilt of the accused, so that the m11rder of the innocent victim would not
be uncompensated.
Scholars disagree regarding the legal consequence of a valid process of
qasamah if its conditions are fulfilled and the guardians of the victim have
taken the fifty oaths. However, the ~ourid opinion is that 'if the conditions
of retaliation are fulfilled, the accused person is to be killed in qi1.a5:. 'This is
"because the Propher i PBUH) said:

"Iffifti illen ofyau take oaths agafttst a nlan of them (that he
is believed to be guilly), he wifl be delivered to yo1, (lo execute
retaliation)."'
Hence, taking oaths replaces, or is regarded as, an evidence.
As regards the legal consequence of a valid process of compurgation; the
great scholar Ibnul-Qayyim said:

"Mere allegation is 11ot sufficient for any U,1bllitie.f to follow. 1f 1111
allegaJia11 is based on presumptio1is rue/, as 11uturiety 1md 111a11ifest
hostility, the legislator allows this allegation to be st,pported vi11 t/ie
process oftakingfifty oat/rs.for it is most unlikely 11,atfifty men 111011/d
!llrjustly .accuse an itmocent man of m11rdet. The hadJth rhat stat.es,
"Ifpeople are granted ( what tliey daim) on basis oftheir claim, they
would daim l'he lives and properties ofpersons, but the oath must
be taken by the defimda11t..."9 does not contradict the uat/1-taking
process what.soever, but it stresses that a mere claim is 1101 erio11gh for
gett//1g t/ie right of ret1.1/iatio11.,,"
Scholars have theopinion that ifa person dies as a result ofover-crowdedness
on the/umu 'ah'(Priday) Prayer or duringperformingtaivaf(circumambulatingthe Ka' bah), his diyah is to be paid from the Public Treasury. They bast their
opinion on the following narration: A man had been killed on the Do.y of
•Arafah (the ninth of Dhul-HIJJah) during Hajj (Pilgrimng¢) as a result of
over-crowdednes.~. His kinfolk~ wenr to Caliph •\Jmar £bnuJ-Khattab and he
told them they had to prove who had murdered him. 'Ali lbn Abu '.[alib was
present and he said to 'Umar,

"O Commander of tlie Believers! A Muslim's blood must be soon

compensated. It is either to find 0111 who murdered him or ro pay
his diyah from the treasliry.''

PUNJS!HME

CHAPTER

Hudud (Prescribed Punishments)
Hudud are the prescribed punishments legally decreed to be executed
when certain sins are committed in order to forbid recommitting them. The
origin of the legality of these prescribed punishments is the Noble Qur'.in, the
S11nnah (Prophetic Tradition) and the consensus of Muslim scholars.

Shaykhul-Jsllm Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
"The prescribed punishments stem from the mercy to all creatures
and doing whatever is good for them. Thus, he who executes
such punishments should have the intention of doing good and
showing mercy to those on whom they are imposed, just like the
father who seeks to discipline his son or the doctor wlw seeks to

cure a patient."'
The wisdom behind ordaining the prescribed punishments is that they are
means of deterrence, restraint, and purification from sins. They are ordained
to fulfill the Rights of Allah, Exalted be He, in the first place, and then for

588

the benefit of the Mu51im <:ommunily. Allah, Ex;ilted be i-fe, has made these
p1111ishmenls incumbent upon those who commit crimes stemming from
weaknes.,es in human nature. Thus, such prescribed punishments ·are in
the best interest of homanlkind in !his world as weU as in the Hereafter. To
illustrate, the affairs of any j;tate do not settle except through having restraints,
deterrents, and punishments to be imposed on criminals. Through applying
these punishments, the disobedient people and outlaws are deterred, the
obedient and law-abiding people feel safe, justice is.established on earth, ancl
people feel secure with reg;1rd to their souls. honors and properties. This can
be seen in the societies that apply the punishments prescribed by Allah, where
security, stability, and welfare are achieved in a way that none can, deny. In
contrasf to this are the societies that dispense with the punishments prescribed
by Allah on !he pretext thm such punishmentq are savage arid ,incompatible
with modern civilization, Thus, thesecommuniti!?S are <leprived of this divine
justice achieved through these prescribed punisbments and the virtues of
security at)d stability they main(ain. V{hatever arms and high technology
such .straying communities have, it avails them nothing until they llpply the
punishments prescribed by Allah for the benefit of His servant&. This fs because
human socleties cannot b1? ruled only by power and technology, but they
are to be ruled by the Law of Allah ,md Ris prescribed punishments; power
and technology cnn only sE:rve as means to execute these legal punishments,
provided they are properly used.
How could those devia,ting people describe the punishments prescribed
by Allah as being savage \41bile :in reality they represent divine me1cy to all
hun1ankind? How could they regard those divine decrees as savage while
oot regarding d1e "~·ongc;loing done by erimin.als as s.avage, though they, the
crimioals, horrify s11fe people. harm the innocent, and disturb social peace and
stability? lo fact, thi$ is t lw real savagery; the one who shows mtm:y !oward
such crlmfnals is more unjust 11nd more savage than the crimihals themselves.
So regrettably. whe11 mit,ds are spoiled and morality vanishes, people see what
i,s sight wrong ~nd vice ver,;:a, In \:hfa r!lgard. ~ poet says,

"For ri s,ore eye, s11111ight might look obsrnrc
And for a sore tongue, water n1ig/1t taste impu,.e".
It is impermissible lo erncute a prescribed punishment Oil~ culprii unless
lhe following lwo conditioris ~re met:

The first ~ondition: is that the culprit must be a legally nccountable
person, i.e. s~ne and ,iduh, for Che Prophet ( PBUH) said:

Ch•pter l <Hudtid'(l'reseribcd Ponishmenrs)

589

"There are·three (persons) whose actions are not recorded: A mfnor
until he reaches puberty, a-lunatic until he regairis his reason, mid
"sleeper until lte (/wakes.•
(Related by the Compilern of Sunan and othen.)
Since none of the acts of worship is obligatory upon such persons, they
are more entitled to be exempted from legal punishments, for they are already
legally unacc.ountable persons, in addition to the fact tb~t legal penalties are
mapplicable in case of suspicion.

The second condition: is 1bat a culprit mu5t be aware c:,f the prohibition
of the act he has committed; otherwise, the prescribed punishment· is
inapplicable. This is because ' Umar Ibnul-Khattab, ' Uthm~n Ibn •Affan:,,.rnd
' ,All lbn Abll lalib (may Allah be pleased With them all) mainl<\ined:

"No prescribed punishment is to be executed except or, hitn who is
aware of it (i.e. awate that his deed entails suah a punishment,"1
That opinion of theirs was dot ~ejected by any of the Companions, and AIMuwaffaq lbn Qudamah said, "This is the opinion ofthe majority ofscnolars."
When these conditions are rtiet by the ~ulprit who commits a crime that
incurs a prescribed punishment, then it is to be cariiedout by the judge (or his
deputy). The Prophet (1PBUH) used to execute the prescribed punishments lind
&o did the Rightly-guided Caliphs. In additioa, it happened that the Prophet
(PBUH) appointed a person to execute a prescribed punishment on his behalf.
as he (PBUH) once said to Unays (in a certain incident):
"O Unaysl Go to the wife of /~i$ man and ifshe confesses (that she
has committed adultery), .t/ier, ~li)r,e .her to ·death."
Moreover, he (PBUH) ordered that Ma' iz was ro,be stoned to death and
1
he (PBUH) did not witness him being stoned . The Prophet (PBUHJ also ~aid
concerning a t hief';

"Take him and cut his hand off, ..•''
A. the prescribed punishment needs ijli/1//d, and because there ls a risk of
transgressing during its executiol\, it must oe undertaken by the Judge or his·
3eputy so as to guarantee complete justice during execution. Thi.s should b~
!he way to follow, wllether the prescribed punishment concerns violating one
of the Rights of Allah, as in the case ofzi114 (adultery or fornkation), or a right
of a human being, as 'in the case of folse accusation of zirsn.

It ls. impermissible to execute prescribed punishments in the moS'que.
!lath~r, they are t.o be executed outside it, for Hakim Ibn Hizam (may Allah be.

"The Messenger of Ailalr (PBIJH) forbnde exectlling qiI~ (legal

(hudud) in tire mosque:•
The poetry meant in this h.nditlr is the immoral one.
In additi0t\, one is prohibited to inte-rcede to prc.veo.t executing a prescri.bed

This is because nothing can Stop crimes u11d safeguud thasociety againr.t

perpetrators. However, replacing the legal punishJUents with mere fines,
imprisonment, or suchlike innovated positive punishments, leads only to
corruption, lnjustice, and spread of evil.

executing the.prescrlbed punishments is obligatory are five: Zintl (adultery or
fornication), theft, banditry, drinking intoidcants, and faise accu.,;ntion of zinci.
As for crimes other than these five, they just entail d.iscretion~ry punishments,
as will be explained later if Allah wills. They also maintain that the severest
lashing is that exeouted as a punishmenl for fornication, then that for false
a~cusation of zfrui, whereas tl1e lashing for drinking intoxicants is less sev~re,
and the least is that executed as a disq etionary punishment. This is b~ause

Fur!hermore,faqihs maintain that if the offender dies during the execution
of a presctihed punishment, the executer will be liable for nothing, £0~ he has
been carrying out the punishment prescribed by Allah, in the way ordained
by /illah, Exalted be He, and enjoined by His Messenger (PBUH). However,
if the e.'"recuter exceeds the legal way o[ execution that the one being punished
dies, the former becomes liable for diyah. Jn this case, the death of the one
being punished has been the result of the transgression of the executer, so the
case becomes .similar to murder rather than a prescribed _punishment. Thu.~,
the executer becomes liable 16 pay the diytlh; this opinion is maintained by

Prescribed Punishments for Zina

Faqihs view that the judge or his deputy must witness the execution of the
punishment for zinil (adultery or fornication). In addition, the execution must
be witnessed by some believers as well, for Allah, Exalted be He, says:

•:..And let a group of the believers witness their punis/1ment."
(Qur'an: An-Nur: 2)
Zi11il is one of the most grievous crimes, and the cases of zina differ in
the degree of immorality, sinfulness, and ugliness. To illustrate, having sexual
intercourse with a married woman, committing incest, and having sexual
intercourse with one's neighbor's wife are the most grievous types of zinil.
Moreover, zinil is a major sin as it results in abominable consequences such as lineal disarray and confusion that lead to disconnection and
miscommunication among people and to their lack of mutual support in
righteousness. ft also causes the corruption and destruction of all aspects

of human llfe. Due to sucb.grievou~consequences ofzlHd., Allah, Ex-alt.ed
be He. has prescribed a severe pu1iishment for adultery; nam~ly stoning
to death, or lashillg and bani~hmenf in case of fornication. Such severe
punishments arc decreed as means of deterrence and avoidance of the
resulting moral and soda.I diseases that afllic.t society. That is why the
Lawgiver of Sl1ari •ah firm ly prohiblted comm itting zfna; Aliah , Exalted
be iie, says.

PrQphet's Companions, the Successors of the Companions, and those who
fullowed them in the various Islamk states through different eras; none has

disagreed on this opinion e·xcept the Kharijites • In nddltion to this, ston ing
to death as a legal pu11ishn1ent-foradultery is stated in the Sunnah (Tn1dition)
of the Messenger of Allah (PBUH), and dearly shown through the Prophetic
sayings and actions that 3/"e recurrently nnrrated. Stoning the offender to
death in case of adultery was also mentioned m the Noble Qur'an, then it
was abrogated ,n wording !rut its ruling is still valid. It had been stated in the
following ver6e before it was abrogated: ''.A11d whim an old man (i.e. a married

Stoning to death in c.\Se ,of adultery is clearly stated in the Qut'An (through
the-aforementioned verse that was abrogated in word1ng but not in ruling). the
recurrent Sunnah, and the consensusorMuslim scholars. However, the Khar~Ites

X l'RESCRJDED AND rnSCRETIONARY PUNISHMENT$

This means that tbere should be no mercy toward fornicators concerning
the execution of the prescribed pw1ishment, nameljrla~hing. Moreover, Allah,
Exalted be He, addresses th(! executer saying:

"... ifyou should be/ie,,e in All11h n11J the L/1$1 Day..."
{Qur'an: An-Niir. 2)
That is, there should lk no me¥cy in such cases if the executer is a trne
believer, as faith entails firmmess in the religious -affairs and exerting all effort
to establish their ruli·ngs.
It is autl1~ntically stated 1n the S,mnolt of the Messenger of Allah. (PBUH)
that a fornlcator ls to be banished for a year io additlon to lashing him/her. That·
is because it is related by At-Tirmidhi and ,other compilers-of Hadith that:

''The Prop/rel {PBUHJ execuied the pt.mislitnent of lashing ,md
bonishfng (the farnic111:o,l, and Abtl Bakr e:x;ecuted the punishment
oflashing and banishrng, and (al.so) •Umtrr executed llie punishment
of lashing a11d banisfli,,g!''
Moreover, the Prophet ('PBtlH) .6.\id:

"When an l.fll!narried male commits fomfcation with an 1111marriedfemale (they should receive) a hundred /asl-ies and banishment
...
Jora y?ar.
lfthe adulterer is a slave, he is to be lashed flfty ta.;he.s, as Allah, Exalted 6e

tte, says-concerning female :ilaves,
~ ..But once they •ire s/1elure,l ill marriage, if they s1101,Id
commit ad11ltery, tl;re,, for tl,em is half tl1e pu11i.$hme11tfor free
[umrrarried] women ..."
(Qur'an; An-Nisa': 25)

There is 110 difference between male and female in this regard. The
prescribed punishment merntion.e<l iu the Qur~n is lashing. Stoning 10 death
;.tas also mentioned in the Qur':111 as the prescribed punishment for11dulteq,
yet lts wording was abrogated but its ruling is still in force.
'The punishment ofbani.shing is not to be executed on slaves, for it hanns
the tnreresl of their masters , In addition, there is nothing mentioned in the
Swmah stattog thal a slave should be banished in this case. The Prophet
(PBUH) said concerning the case nf • salve girl who commits fornicatTon
1vhile. not being in a state of /fu,ln, i.e. not sheltered in marriage:

"Ifshe ~ommits fomic,ltion, !hen lash lter; if she commits it ag<lin,
(/,,en lash lteragpin; and ifshe reper1ts ii/or (a t/1ird time), then lash
h,nfnr (<l tltird ti,u~) .. .'"1

Rov,,ever, he fPBUJ:i) did not me1ifion bani_shmenr concerning the forrif•
ca1i6n 6fslaves.
The prescribed punishment is not to be executed unless the case is void
of suspicion of zir,,1 (adultery or fornicat1on), for the Messenger, of Allah
{PB\JH) said:

~ vert /Jl,mishments in the case ofsuspicion as much as you ca11."a
Thus, there is no prescribed ,punlsb.roent applicable to the,one who has
sexual intercourse in the foll9wing cases:
1- lf one has sexual intercourse wilh a woman mts.takeniy believing !hat
she is his wife
2- lf one thinlcs one's marril!ge ,ontract ls valid while it is not
3- If the validity of one's marriage is controversial
4- If one is unaware of tl:ie. prohibition of zinti because of being a
new convert to Tsh11n or being brought up somewhere away from
Islamic states
5, Ifone is forced to commit zina

1bnul-Mundhir said,
".All the people of religiou5 knowledge (sc/101ars) Jieom w11om we imve
derived knowledge 11nanimo(,,s/y agree that 11,e execution ofprescribed
punishments should be averted in the case of mspiciori.•'
In fact;this isanaspectoftheeasinessar1d leniency ofSharl' ah (Islamic Law),
as suspicion indicates that the mnner has commitled the sin unintentio11ally.
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"; •. A11d there is no blame 11pon you for that i11 111hlch you have
erred but [only for] what yo11r /,earls intended. A1td everis AllJJh
Forgiving and Merciful.n
( Qur'an:, Al-Abzab: 5)
Among the conditions that obligate executing the prescribed punishment
on the offender of zina is that there must be certainty that s/he ha~committed
it. Such certainty cannot be reached e:itcept through two ways:

l'li.e firsl way is !hat the offender confesses four times that s/he has
committed zi11ci. This is due to the fact I.hat, Ma· iz Ibo Malik (may AU~h be
pl.eased with him) confessed to !he Prophet (PBUH) four times that he had
committed it after which the P·rophct (PllUH) applied tbe legal punishment

X PlU::SCRHlllD ANO DJSOl.ETIONARY PUNISHMENTS

to him,. he (PBUH) kept refraintng from punishing him three times, until
Ma \iz ,onfessed for the fourth Lime. If confessing less than four limes had
been enough to execute the: punishment, the Prophet (PBUH) would have.
executed it on him at any <lf'lhe three cimes of confession.
The confession is not deemed valid unless the offender declares that he/
she has committed zind in p l'ain words. If he/she does not mention the sin
of aµ,tl in'the confession, then no punishment is applicable, as the offender
might mean any- prohibited act of lust tliat does· no, entail a prescribed
punishment, unlike zina. that is why the Prophet (PBUH) said to Ma.' iz
(may Allah be pleased with him) whe.n the latter confessed to the Prophet
(PBUH):

"Maybe you have 011/y kissed her. winked at her, or looked at her
ousrfi,111

r'"

Wilen M~' ii insisted he did it. !he Prophet (PBUH) kept illquiring until
there were no other possibilities.
Moreover, if the olfendei: recants his/her confession before the execution
of the punishment. he/she must not be punished. This is illustrnted in the way
lhe Prophet ('PBUH) contin'ued asking M~ ' iz (and others in other cases) ln
cose the latter tnkeshis confe:;sion.back. Also, when Ma'li t1·ied to escape while
being punished and !hen the people C11Ugfit hini and stoned him to death, the
Prophet (PBUH) said:

•why did yot, not leav,! hit17, fo r/,,; might repenr and Allah would
. repentance.? "II
accept Ius
The second way to reach certainty concerning-a case of ziwl (adultel')' or
fornication) i~ the presence of four witnesses. Allah, Exalted be f:le, says:
"Wliy aid they {who sla11deredJ11Dt producefor It four witnesses?..!'
(Qur'an: An-Nur: 13)
Allah also says:

% 1d those who ncc.mse cflaste women a11d tl1e11 do not produce
Jo14r witnesses ...;,
(Quran: An-NOr: 4)

(Qur~: An-Ni~ft': lS)

Chaprcr 2: Prescribed Pilni&hmoms far Z ii1J

The conditions for the validity of testimony In the case of zina:
I - Tl\e four witnesses must testify against the adulterer ( or the fornicator)
at the same place of assembly.
2- They 111ust testify for the Sllme single case of zina, i.e. their testimony
must concern the same specific case of dnii committed by that person"
3- They m4St describe the committed sexual intercourse in a way that
puts aside the possibility of commftt:ing any sin other than zluii. This is
'because some actions precedmg the sel(u~l intercourse do not deserve
the legul penalty for :ritril, such as kissing and foreplay;so the witnesses'
testimonies must be made clear to put aside any doubt
4- The four witnesses must be ;ust men, for neither the testimony· Qf
women ri<)r that of wicked, dissolute people is accepted.
5- 1ihere must be no defects invalidating the testrm.ony of any· of them,
sucli as blindness or the like.

If one of these conditions is not fulfilled, then the prescribed pw1ishmenf
of slandering must be executed upon the Witnesses, for 'in this case the)' are
considered slanderers-. Allah, Exalted be He. says:
'\4-nd those w/10 accuse chaste women a11d then do hot produce four
(Qnr'an; An~Nur: 4)
witru,sses - lash them etghty l111hes ..."
Scholars- unanimously agree that ziml can be proven by any of the
aforementioned two ways, namely confession and,testimony. Yet, they disagree
nn whether there is a third way that can prove lt, namely pre.gnancy, as ln the
case when a woman conceives while having neither a husband nor a master
(if she is a slave girl). Some of th~ schol:.rs malntafn that this case does not
entail a Jlrescr,ibed punishment on the woman, for she may be pregnant due
to a doubtful marriage or compulsion. Other scholars believe that this case
deserves executing the prescdbed punishment asJo.ng as the wpman does nol
chum any matter of suspicion concerning her pregnancy.
ShaykhuJ-Isllm lbn Taymiyah said:
"Tl1is ruling - that a pregnant woman who has neither a hmba11d
r101· a m(lster is to be legally p1111ished - is tlie one knowh 10 l1ave
bceri c,11-ried out at the time~ of ihe Righlly-guidect Coliphs, and ii is

Furthermore, lbnul-Qayyim said:

'" Umarlbn11l-J-.'hallab.iudged that the woman who 'becomi,s preg11a111
while l1avfng neilhei· a /~usband 11or a mruter is to be stoned to death.
TAfs is the opinio11 ado,pted by the MiiUki School, and it is the more
valid of the .two opi11ions artribured to /Jndm Ahmad, bei11g base,:/ on
irrefutable evidence, ,mmcly the womans pregnanay."
h•s~as the presqibed pl\laishmenti~ to b~ eice.<:u,ted lo case ofzi11u(adultery
or fornication) when its coniditions are fulfilled, it is to be eicecuted in case of
sodomy, narnely having anal sex, which is an e,•ll crimeaqd an ugly perversion
contradictory to nntunl Ji~:positio1i. Allah, Exalted be HI!, said regarding !!1.e
People of Propbe1 L(it (Lot) who used to practtce sodomy:

"... Do you comrrril•suet, immorality 4$ no one hqs preceded
you witl, from among the worlds [i.e.. peoples]? Indeed, you
approach inen wi1l11 desire, l11stead ofwomen. Rather, you are
a tramgressingpeople!'
(Quian:Al-A ' raf: 80-81)
[n fact, sodomy is prohiil>ited according to the Noble Qur'an, the Sunnah,
and the consensus of scholiirs. Ajlah, Exalted be He, describes the People of

Prophet Lu! as committing an u1\precedented immoral act, so such people
ate deviants in this world. Allah also describes them as being trespassers,
transgressors, and criminals;. Thus, because of the ugliness of their sin, Allan
punished the People of Prc,phet Lilt with a puniihment that He had never
afflicted any other people wi,th1He ILl!'Ded their town upside down and rained
on them stoues ofhard clay. In addition to this, the Messenger of Allah (PBUH)
cursed both the one who pr;ictices sodomy and his part11er ", Sh~ykhui-.Ldim
lbn Taymiyah (may Allah h1ave mercy on him) said:

"The most valid opinicm mainlained by the Prophets Comp.anions
is that both tliose who practice sodomy ore to be killed, whether
they are mufuans" or nQt.• He added: "The Companions of the
Prophet have not 1/iffcred on ki!/111g sodomites, and some of tftem

Moreover, ibn Rajah said:

ln this connection, lm'im Ab.mad said, "The prescribed pu11islmumt for a
sodomite is stoning-to de~ whether he has previously married nr 1101." Thia is
the same opinion maintained by imam M~Hk and others, and it is also on~ of
the two opinfons attributed to Imam Ash-Shafi'L This is b~c3use the Prophet

sodomy), kill tJ1e one w/'10 ,does it, cmd the 011e to whom ft is done.""

(Related by !\hti Dawtid)
According w another narration, the Prophet ( PBUH) Sl!id:

~ .. Jd/1 the up.per and the lower (i.e. the two partners).''' 1
Among !he acts- of sodomy is having annl sexual inrercourse with one's
wife. Allah, Exa)i~d be He, says:

•~.. then come to t1,em {i.e. wives]jrom wiiereAltah has ordained

1md lo!'ts those !l'ho purify t1iemsclves:"
(Qur'an: Al-Baqatah: 222)
Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, and others, maintained that the lawful sexual intercourse meant iii the verse is thab nade thro4gh,one'swife's vagina; "from where
Allah has ordained for you."
In addition, ' Ali Iba Abu Ial_hah reported that ibn ' Abbas sa1d:
'"The verse·t/1at reads, '. ..t/r,m co111e to them from where Al/al, has

Prescribed Puritishment for Slander
Faqihs define slander as accusing some person of adultery, fornication, or
sodomy. It is a prohibited act acc:ording to the Noble Qur'an, the Sun11ah and
the consensus of Muslim scholar.s.
Allah, Exalted be He, says:
•~nd those who accuse ch,iste womet, and t/1en do notproducefour
witnesses - lash them eighty lashes and do not accept from them
testimony ever after. And those are the defia.ntly disobedient:'
(Qur'an: An-Nur: 4)

The legal punishment for the slanderer in this world is lashing, the rejection
of his testimony, and considering him a defiantly disobedient wicked person
as long as he does not prove what he has claimed. As for his punishment in the
Hereafter, it is stated in the verse in which Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"Indeed, those who [jalse,ly] accuse chaste, unaware and believing
women are cursed in this· world and the Hereafter; and they will

{i.e. deserved/ recompense, and tfiey will know .fhut it ls Allah
Who is the Manifest Trutli [i.e. Perfect /i, fustice]:'

(Qur'an: An-NW'; 23-25)
Moreover, the Prophet (F'BU H) mentioned slander as orte of the enom1ou$,
destructive m~jor sins when he said:

"Avoid the seve11 ff/O$t ,;Jestmctive major sins."
He (PBUR) pointed outthat among those seven destructive major sins was:

''. .. slandering chaste. unaware believing women (i.e. women who
arc so chaste that they are even 1itunvare ofimmorality)."
Furthermore, Muslim sc;h9lars unanimously .agree on the prohlbirion of
slander, regarding it as ·one G,f the major sins.
Allah, Exalted be He, has ordained a deterrent legal punishment for thi:.
slanderer. If a legally accou.nt11ble person falsely accuses a chaste petson of
committing adultery, fom.ic;itioo, or sodomy, the sJ'a11derer is to be lashed
eighty lashes, for Allah, Exalted be He, s.ays:

~d those who accuse chaste women an4 tl,en do not produce
four witnesses - lash tl1e111 eighty lashes... (Qull'an; An-Nilr: 4)
#

The verse indicates thaf if those who accuse chaste modest women do
not proc!uce four witnesses to testify to what they have claimed, then they
(the acc:users) ~re to be lash,ed eighty lashes. It does not make any difference
whether the accused person ,i.s a man or a woman, but women are mentioned io
particular because the verse refers toa specific incident.Md because slandering
women is an uglier and mor<! recurrent deed than·slanderi.ng n\en.
'fhis punishment is ord:ained to be executed on the slanderer in order
to preserve the honors of Muslims from profanation, to safeguard innocent
chaste people against such offenses and obscenities, and to protect the Muslim
community from tbe spread of'sin and corr4p\ion.
The mub;.an pet5on, defaming whom entails the leg-,tl punishment for
slander, is the on6 who is fr1ie, Muslim, ~ane, chaste, and able to have sexual
intercourse. Jbn Ru&hd (Ave:rroes) said;

Chap1<r 3: Pr~ribcd l'wiiShmen.t for Slander

605

"Scholars hl!l'e. ummitnuusly agreed thur the slandered person must
have the following five char,acteristics (to regard the case as slander):
legal tnajority.freedom, chastity, Islam, and .the ability to have sex11al
frltercourse , If any of tl1ese conditions is not fulf/1/ed, the application
of the punishment for slander becomes invalid."'
Carrying out the pllJlishmecat for slander is a right belongirtg only to the
slandeced person; it is dropped if he forgives the slanderer, and It cann6! be
executed except upon liis requei;t Thus., if the sl~dered person pardons the
slanderer, the lntter is lo be exemp1ted from the prescribed punishment. However,
the slanderer in th.is case is to b,e discretionarily punished to deter him from
going on slattderiog others, whic:h is a p~ohibited act thai incuI5 the curse and
the painful punishment of Allah as sfated in the Qur'an. Shaykhul-hlllm tbn
Taymiyah (may Allah have men:y on him) said, ~Scholars unanimously agree
t]lat tl/e prescribed punis/ime11t fo•r slander is not to be executed except upo,:i the

request of the slandered person.'''
ff someone slanders an absent person, he ls not 10 be punished until the
slandered person returns and asks to execute the prescribed punishmenror if
it is proven that he has asked for it in his.absence.

Words of Slander are of Two Types
1- Plain words: such words imply nothing but slander, so the slanderer's
atlegarion of intending something other than slander is ,not acceptable
in th.is case. Slander in d{ rect, plain words includes such expressions as
''you adulterer; "yo11 for:nicator:' or "you sodomite:•
2- Allu.sive words: snch word,; ilnplyslander along wi~h other meanings,
so the slanderer's claim •~f intending something other than 5Jandcr is
:1.ccept.ible in. this case. Slander in such nl111slve,,indirect, metonymk
words includes such expressions as ..you lecher;' or "you dissolute;'
or the like. In the latter case, if the slanderer claims that he meruu;
something other than adultery by calling the other person a "dissolute"
or a "lecher'; his claim is to be accepted arid he does not become liable
to pun!Shment. '!'his is b,:cause"hfs words are ailusive and they indtcate
orher meanings, so ther1e should be no punishment according to tbe
legal rule that states, "Legal punishments are averted in the ca.<ie of
suspicion:"

X l'RioSCRILl!:D AND OISCRETidNARYPUNiSl:IMENTS

Uthe slanderer accu~es a group of people of adulter y while they·are far
above suspicion, or jfbe slandl!rs the people of a whole town, then no prescribed
punishment is to be executed upon him, yet he is to be discretionarilypunid1ed.
This is because it is cettain that sucn a person is telling a lie, so 09 shame
befalls the accused ones. Still, he is to receive a tli~cretionary punishment to
give up such offenses and obscenities that involve a sin entailing punishment.
even if none of the accused persons asks for it.
ff any one slanders a prophe1, he is regarded as a disbeliever, for it is an act
of apostasy. Sbaykhul-Isliim lbn Taynuyah (may Allah have mercy on himl
said, "Slandering tire wives of tire Prophet (PBUHJ is the same as slandering,the
P.rt,1p/1et (PBUH/ himself, tlie slanderer is considered an apostate."'
Concerning whether the slanderers repent1mce is accepted if he repents
before the slandered person is acquainted with the slander, ShaylQil-lsl:1111 lbn
Taymiyah said.

·~n,e sound opi11iot1 is' that it differs from one perso11 to another due
to the differences between pe.ople, Most sd,olars maintain that if
t'/ie slandered petsoil knows abottf tl,e slander, then the rep,mtallcl!
of t/1e s/nnderor is nor u.ccapted. But if rl,c slandered person doflS
1101 know, tl·,en the slanderer~ repent,wice is accepted, yet he
should pray for the slandered person and ,1sk Allah'sforgiveriess Ji1r
~landering him .. :·'

Thus, It has become obvious how a: dangerous organ one's to11gue is and
how grievous what one utters could be. That ls why the Prophet (PBUH)
rhetorically says:
"ls. 1here a11ythlng that i:auses people to be thrown it1to t/ie Hellfire
upon t/ieir faces other than the outcome ef their tong11es (i.e. the
verbal sins)?"'

Moreover. Allah, E,ralted be He, Sll)'S:
' 1He {i.e. matt] does not utter a11J1 word except tl1M !Plih '1im is an

(Qur'a.n: Qaf; [8)

So, one must keep one's tongue away from saying what is prohibited,

Prescribed Punishment for
Intoxicants
Every beverage that intoxicates is prohibited according to the Qur'an, the
Smmah and the consensus of Muslim scholars. Allah, the Exalted, says:

"O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, {sac•
rificlng on] stone alters {to other than Allah], and divining
arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it
that you may be sut:cessful. Satan only wants to cause between
you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling
and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from
prayer. So will you not desistr" (Qur'an: AI-Ma'idah: 90-9l)

Hashish and all other dir11gs are among the most destructive means that
ruin the Muslim youth nowadays. Ther are considered the most dangerous
weapon exported to us by our enemies. They are propagated in our laods by
the Jews ~nd their agents so as to destroy Muslims, corrupt tbei:r youth, hinder

Muslim youth have become 11arcotized, living either as dependents on their

of narcotics and ,intoxfcants in the Islamic countries. There is neither might
nor powe.r except ill Allah, the Mo8t High, the Most Great.
Intoxicants are by all means problbited, and drinking is imperl)1issible
whatever the aise may be; it i1s in1permissible to drink for pleasure, as medicatioo, for qu(.ncrung thirst, or foFany other reason.

If a Muslim willingly drinks alcoholic liquor or anything mixed with it,
such as cologne or sochlike perfumes that contain alcohol, while being awarethat it intoxicates, the prescribed punishment for drinking is to be lmposed 011
him, for the Prophet (PBUH) say:,:
•
·"ff an,vone drfnks an intoxicant, then lash him."'

(Related by Abu Dawud ancl other compilers of li_adi/h)
The prescribed punishment lfor dr)nkiJtg is eighty fashes. •Umar !bnulKhattab (m.ly Allah be pleased with him) consulted the people as regards'!he
p.rescribed punishment for drinking intoxicants. Thereupon, ' Abdur-Ra!imAn
lbn ' Awf said:
"Make it the same as tlm liglitest prewriber:1 Rl.!rtishment; eighty lashes."

Thus, •Umar executed it as eighty lashes. Then, he wrote to Khalid Ibnul•

new ruling. (Related by Ai!-Daraqu.!ni and others)'
l 'hat incident was "~tnessed by both the Mu/tajirim and the Anidr and

Moreover. Sbay.khul-lslAm Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on

people become addict'ed to ailcohol w1d they are rrot deterred except

The prescribed punishmml becomes incumbent upon the c;onf~ssion of
the drinker or afrer the testimony of two just witnesses. Yet, scholars disagree
concerning the one who sm.ells of alcohol and whether that proves his guilt
or not. Some maintain that fhe prescribed punishment is inapplicable in this
case, and that only a discreI,ionary punishment is to be carried out. Others
say that the prescribed punishment is applicable lo the one who smell.s of
alcohol unless he daims soU11ething that makes the case suspicious. The laiter
is th!/ opinion reported to have been maintained by Imiim Ahmad. Likewise,
it is the opinion of Imam Mtilk, and it is also the ,opinion chosen by SheiRh
Taqyyud-Din Ibn Taymiyah ,(may Allah have mercy on him), Shaylchol-Islam
Jbn Taymiyah said:

"He who has drc11111stari:tiill evi,le11ces provfr1g lte is guilty ofdrinking,
like the smell of alcohol~ is more d,;,se111ing to be punished ·than th/!
one whose guilt is proven by witnesses 01· confession, /IS both may be
true orfalse (unlike the smell of alcohol). The Ptophet~ Compa11/Qns
1111attimo1tsly agree on r,l1is opir1ion.n"
Moreover, lbnnl-Qayyirn, {may Allah have mercy on hirn) said:

"Both •Umar a11d Ibn Mas •,idjudged ti/al the p1'(!$cdbed punishment
is to be. carried out 011 N11! perso11 who smells of alcohol, whether he
is a ma11 or riot. None disagreed 011 that judgment of · Umar ond lbn
Mas· ud tlien."
The danger of intoxicants .is really grave it is the cunning means used by
Satan to,mislead Muslims. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"'Sata11 only want, to cause between you animosity fffld haired
through Intoxicants and gambling and to avert you from l11e
remembrance ofAllo,h and from prayer. So will you not desist?"
tQur'a n: Al-Maidah: 91)

In addition, wine represe:nts the mother of ,ill evils. The Prophet (PBUH)
cursed ten persons related 1~ wine, among them are those !nduded in the
following hadith:

':->.llt-1h has cursed wine, the 011e who drinks it, the one who serves it,
the one who sells it, the one who buys it, the nl1t who pressc$ it, the
011e for whom ii is pressed, the one who conveys it, arid the orie to

ln the narration related by lbn Majah, there is another one added:,
~ .. and the one who eats 11p its price."

Thus, all Muslims should resist wine firmly and courageously, through
blocking its sources and imposing a deterrent punishment on those who
drink or promote it. This is because wine leads one to ~ I evils and sins an\l
aliena.tes one from all kinds of goodness. May Allah spare aliMuslims its .evils
and dangerS:. The Prophet (PBUH) pointed out in al!ndfth that toward the end
of time, some people would deem w·ine permissible; they would refer to it With
other names and would shamelessly drink it". Therefore, MU$lims m1-1st b~ on
their guard against such Wicked people.

Discretionary Punishments

From the juristic point ofview, a discretionary punishment is a disciplinary
one intended to prevent wrongdoing and transgression. It is also a means of
honor and respect, for when one is deterred through it and refrains from
wrongdoing, one becomes more honorable and respectable.
As for the ruling on the discretionary punishment in Islam, it is obligatory
to be carried out for every sin for which there is neither a prescribed
punishment nor expiation, whether it is related to doing something prohibited
or abandoning something obligatory. A discretionary punishment is to be
executed by the judge in case he finds it beneficial to apply it, yet the judge is
to give it up if he sees otherwise. Executing discretionary punishments does
not need to be requested, so an aggressor is to be discretionarily punished
even without the request of the aggressed person; it depends upon the judge's
discretion, as crimes differ as regards the degree of enormity and frequency.

616

X 1'.RESCRl!lED AND DISCRETIONARY PUNISHMENTS

The-sound opinion is:thatthere is no fixeddfacretionary puni_sbment, but
if fhe offense is related to a 6in that already has a prescribed punishment, like
zina (adultery or fornication) or theft, a discretionary pwilsbmeot -should
never reach the amount of the prescribed one.

A discretionary punishment may reach killing if necessary, such as killing
a spy, kllfing .o ne wl10 seeds aissention among Muslims and ~evers their unity,
and killing one who invites people to abide by something other than the Book
of l\llah, the Quran, .and the Su1111ah (Tradition) of His .Messenger (PBUH).
Thus, killing as a discretionary punishment is applicable in suchlike.cases for
which there is no deterrent punishment other than killing.

Shaykhnl-lsli\m lbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) safd:
"This is the most just opinion, an4 it is stated i11 the Suti11al1 and
the tradiH011 of tJur Rightly-g11ided Ca/;phs. 1b- illustrate, the Propmt
(PBUH) ordered thnt the husbn11d wbose wife made her slave girl
lawful for him (to l1ave sexual Intercourse with) was to be scourged
a hundred lashes. Ukewise, Aini Bal.T As-Siddiq a11d 'Umar JbmtlKhattab ordered that tile ma11 a11d tl·,e woman who were found in
one bed (though not a married couple) were to be beaten a lwndred
lashes each, Also, 'Umar ordered that S.abi'gh wa.s lo be scaurged so
severely (as u discretio11a1y punishmenl)..."1
Sbaykhul-ldam added:

"Tf the i11te11tio11 (behind the di$Cretionary punishment) is to repel
com1ptio11 thal wou/JJ not be repelled except through killing, then
killing is to be executed. Tims, ,.>hen the offender repB41$ the same
wrongdoi11gas he /=not bee11 deterred bythe prescribedpunishme-,1t,
then he is regarded as an assaulting person whose aggression cmmot
be stopped except through /(i/ling, $0 Ire is to be kil/ed." 1
There is no minimal limit for a discretionary punishment, as crimes dlffer
in the degree of aggression and according ,to the different circumstances and
ages. Thus, some punishments are referred to the discretion of the judge who
should decide according to the necessity and the public interest, provided his
discretionary punishmeilt accords with what Allah has o«!ained and avoids
what Allah has prohibited.
Just as discretionary punishments may be .executed through lash'ing, they
may also be executed through detention, !ilapping, ;tdmonitlon, banishment, and
theJil~e. Shaykhul-IslAm lbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on hicn) said:

~A discretionary punisl1me11/ may be ad111ittislered througlr rev,'/ing
tlte honor of the tra11sgressor by oalling ltim, for example, 'you

(as a sign of disdain)..."

There is ahadith in which the! Messenger of Allah (PBUH) says:
"Nobody sho1ild be lashed more than ten lashes unless he/she is

(Rela ted by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)'
Those scholars who pl!nnit making a discretionary punishment more thaJ.'l

a pur1is/11ne11t prescribed by Allait here means "unless he exceed5 one of the
limits set b y Allah''. which is accoeptable in Ambic. Thus; they argue t.haL the
6ins that incur more than ten lash,is are those related to prohibited matters, and
the prohibited matters are the limits ~et by Allah. A~cordingly. a discretionary
punishment for a certain crime is to be decided acco,.ding to ,the benefit of the
punishment llnd t he grnvlty of th,e crime.
It is impermissible to cut off one of the parts of the offender's body, to
wound him, or to shave his.beard i1sa discretionary punishment, for this causes

Prescribed Punishment for
Stealing

Allah, Exalted be He, says:
[As for} the thief, tl,e male and the female, amputate their
hands in recompense for what they earned [i.e., committed]
as a deterrent [punishment] from Allah. And Allah is Exalted
in Might and Wise.
(Qur'an: Al-Ma'idah: 38)

Moreover, the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"The hand should be cut offfor stealing something that is worth
a quarter of a dinar or more."'
In addition, Muslim scholars have unanimously agreed on the legal
necessity of cutting off the hand of the thief in general.

X PRESCRffiEO AND OISCREllONARY PUNIS~IME.N'f S

The I hief is a corrupt member of society; ff left. his corruption would
spread in the body of the nation. Th11$, h~ sbni.tld be restrained by applying the
suitable penalty to inhibit him. Therefore, Alla!\, Exalted be He, has legislated
cutting off the hand of the thief; such an unjust hand that reaches out for what
is not rightful foe it, such a !\and that destroys ralher than co.nsfructs, and takes
rather than gives .
.Stealing is the act of taking a property stealthily from its owner or his
deputy while the thicfis subjected to·th<! Laws of Islam and the stolen property
has reached the t1iidb, 1 provided th.at be has taken the stolen property froni a
repository for safek~eplng objects of the kind. !tis also a condition, lo regard
the case as theft. that the owner of the stolen property is protected by lslal!l,
11nd that there is no doubt that the offender has no right to take i l
Thus, there are certain qualities th.it must be fulfilled in the thief, the stolen
per,;011, !he stolen property and the monnerofstealing, and all these quahtfesare
included in the aforementioned definition. Wbeoever any of these condition~
is 11ot fulfilled, the hand should pot be cut off. The~e conditions are:
The act of stealing must be committed stealthily; otherwise, the prescribed
punishment of cutting the hand off is not to be executed, as when the property is
plundered publicly or i~ usurped, for in such case the owner of the property can
seek help and pwush the oppressor a.nd the usurpel'. With regatd to this, Imim
lbnol-Qayyim b'a)'.S:
"The penalty ,if ct1tfi11g off the ltand is to be executed cm the thief
rather thm, tf,e plu,uletcr n11d the 11surpe1; as it is impossible to lie
g,Mnlcd against /,im, for he (the /hief) digs out houses, rips open
repositories of properties and breaks tile seals. So, if wt/lug <iff lhe
hand were not legislnted, people wn11'/d steal one a110£/m; damage
would aggmvate, and /rards/1ip wot,ld grow severer."'

Moreover, the author of the book e.nlitled Al-lft.ab. (Demomtratiori) says:
"Schoh1rs rmanimously agree that Jo,· t!te embez;ler. the plu11derer
t1rid t/1e ,,1s11rper. desp/te the gmvfty of tlreir tri/11~ t1nd their sin,
110 a1r1pw,1/Jori of the /wmis is to be eJ<·ec,11cd 011 any of the11L IL i$
perml.ssible to prevent t/ieir aggression by meru,s of disciplining,
punis/,i r,g, long imprisonmc11t, and deterrent penalty by confiscating
their properties."'

Furthennore, to execute the prcsGJ·ibed punishment of nmplltation, what
i~ srolen must be an inviol4,le property, for what is not deemed a propaty is
not lnvlol~ble, such a~ the instruments of amusement, intoxicant$, the ~wine

and the dead animals. Also, concerning Whal is considered a non-inviolable
property due to its owner's being a disbelieving warrior against Muslims, .no
amputation_is to be executed. Thi,s i~ because the blood and property of &uch
a person ls lawful.

In addition, to ei,;ecute the p,unishmenl of amputation in stealing, the
stolen property must not be less th an the ni,Ulb, which is three Islamic dirbams
that equal a quarter of an Islamk dinar. Tbis amount can be estimated by
comp!ll'ing its vafue to what equals it in other currencies or by estimating the
value of the stolen ,properties according to each ~ge, fo, regard to this ruli~g,
th~ Prophet {PBUH) says:

"The hand ,of a thief is not tc, be er/I off but for n quarter of a di,u1r
or more..,;
(Related by Ahmad, Muslim and other compilers of I:i.adilh)
During the lifetime of the Prophet (PBUH), the value of a quarter of a
dinar, which was made of gold, used 10 equal three dir.bams, which were made
ofsilver. There is a clear wisdom im ordaining such amount for the prescribed
punishnumt of runputation, for such amount can mostly suffice a person and
those .be provides for in a day. 'I'h11s, it is worthy of consideration that a hand
i.s to be cut off for stealing a quarter of a dinar though the indemnity paid
for cuUing it off is five hundred dinars-. Thls is because when it is honest, it
is precious; whereas, when fr betrays, it becomes worthless. Abu!-' Ala' t\1Ma ' arrl. one of the atheist poets, c,bjected to this saying:

A /1and w/1ose indemnity is ])"e h,mdrec/ golden pieces
Wherefore rnl off/or stealing_ 11 quarter ofa dinar?
One of the Muslim scholars replied to him saying:

Honesty 111<1de ii 1tt,1/uable, betrayal made it cheape'I
So, ntind the Wisdom of t/1e Crea/or
Among 1he conditions that' must be fulfilled for amputating the hand of
the thief is that the stolen property- ls taken from its repository. The, repositc)ry
of a property is the place where thl.ngs are usually put for safekeeping, becau,se
depositingsomething_indicates saJekeepiqg i~ The repository differs according
to the kind of property, diffe.renc.e of places, -and the ruler\; beiogjust or unj!lsl,
and his power or weakness. For example, the valuable properties are to be
preserved inside houses, stores, ,ind fortified boildm.gs and l:he like under
secure conditions, and so on according to the n~ture of the preserved property

and the customs of the plaq!. Hence, if a property is srolen from a place whidi
is not comidered a repository of such ~ thing, as when a thief steals from a
building whose door is open or from n brnken repository, then no amputation
is to be executed on him.
T here mu.s t aot be aay doubt on the side of th~ thief. Thai is, tflhere is
any doubt that may ju.stify t he t.h ief stealing, then his hand is not to be cut off,
according to the hadith•of the Prophet (PBUH) in which he says:

'½verl pw1isltmtnll in -//re case of suspicicm as much ns j(JIJ cnn.''"

Thos, the penalty of cu,tting off the hand is not to be ex.ecoted in C:ISi!
somevne steals from his father's property or from his sons proper!)'• as each of
them has a right in the property of the other. This co11stit.utes a doubt tha1 aver rs
the e:.:ccution of the prescribed penalty. Similarly, everyone who is entided to a
righl in a properly and takes from it, his hand is not to be cut off. However, it
is prohibited for such a person to do such .111 act: ,thus, he must be punished for
doing 1his and the property he has taken must he returned to its owner.
fn addition ro the above·•meationed conditions, theft has to be provt!d by
one of two ways, Firstly, two upright men tn\lSI testify to lhe lhefl and desa-ibe
how ste~ling has occurred, its repository. the amount stolen and its kind, in
order to remove all other doubts and possibilities. Secondly, the thief may
confess twice that he bas stolen. This is based on the followiug lladit/i relarecf
by Abu Dawad:

':ii thief w/10 admitted sl.ealing was summoned before t11e ,Pmphet
(PfJUH). The Prophet (PBUH) said to him, 'I do not thi11k yott have
;-to/en.' He (the thief) replied, '1 did.' The Prophet (PBUH) repeaied

ii twice or thrice (and the ma11 fr1sisted 011 his confession). Thus, the
Prophet (PBUH) on:ler.ed that his /,mid lie cut ojfand it was rione!''
The confession made by•a thief rnusr toe.Judea description ofthe way he has
committed stealing in ord~r to refutfi the possibility that he might mistakenly
believe iliat h i~ hand must be amputated whereas the c~se does not eatail such
a penalty. Moreover, !his helps establish ,vhether the conditions of nmput.iling
the thief's hand 11re fulfilled.m· ll<lt.
The person whose prop•~rty is s1olen must reclaim his property. In case
he do~s not, the pe·nalty of ct1t1ing off the hand is not to be execute.d, slnce
properly becotnes allowable· by the perntission of ifs owner. Conseque.ndy, if
tile owner does not.demand hls pmperty back, then it is possible that he has
allowed the accust!d person to 1,1ke ii, ~ud this constitutes a doubt that averts
the execution of.the leg11l pennhy.

If tl\e aoadition~ for cutting off the hand are .ill fulfilled, it is obligatilry
to amputate the thief's hand. Therefore, his right hand is to be cut off. This is
accordi11g to t1ie way in which ' Abdullah Ibn Mas ' Od (moy Allah be pleased

(Qur'an: Al-Ma'id11h: 38) as ".••amputate their right ha11ds ..." The position
of cutting is from the wrist julnt, as the hand is the organ one uses in stealing;
thus, the thief is punished by destroying such a meam. After amputating_ the
hand, the proper· treatment should be applied in order to stop the bleeding
and cure U1e wound through the available rrJeuns of medlration. And, Alll!h,

Allah, Exalted be He, wants Muslims to walk safely through His la11d, for
interchanging benefits, increasing their properties, maintain ing good relations
with their relatives and helping c,ne another in virtue, righteousness and piety,
especially when traveling to 1hi: Ka' bah (at Mecca) to perform the rites of
Ha_ij (l'ilg1·image) and •Umn1/r (Lesser Pilgrilnage). Thus, whoever intends
to obstruct people's course, or terrorize them 011 their journeys, Allah has
legislated a deterring penalty to eliminate such an obstacle and l1arm from the
way of Muslims. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"111deed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah a111i
His Messe11ger and stri1ve upon earth [to cause] corruption is
none but that they be kiUed or cr11cified c>r that their hands and

(Qur'an;_ Al-M;i'idah; 33-34)
The meant wannongers iln the aforementioned noble Qur'anic verse who
sttive throughout l:he land musing harm and mischief are the highwaymen,
who harass _people in th;, dell tr! or inhabited areas and seize their properties
publicly not stealthily.
[t is stipulated to execute the prescribed penalty on the highwaymen that
what they have seized be tantamount to the ni~ab of theft. It is .ilso ~tipulated
that they have stolen from a. repository, like seizing the property from the
hands ofits owner while beirng ln a caravan, Also, the highway robbery must
be proved whether through the htghwaymeas own coafession or through the
testimony of two upright men.
The legal punishments higbwa)'men are to receive differ accvrding to their
crimes as follows:
• Whoever kills 3nd seizei, people's property is to·be killed and crucified until
his ~Time ls well-known. Such a person must not be pardoned according
to the consensu.~ of Muslim scholars as stared bylbnal-Mundhir.
• Whoever kills 1¥ithou1 seizing an)' property must be kill.ed w1thout
beiqg crucified.
• W11oever seizes the property without committing murder, his right
hand and bis left leg ,ire to be cut off at one time, then the bleeding is
to be stopped, .rnd tht;n he is to be rele.ised.
• Whoever just terrorize:, people 011 the way withoul committing murder
llr seizing nnyprQper!y must be exiled from the land causing him to be
homeless. He should 1001 oe allowed to stay in ,my country but should
be expelled.
Thus. the punishments the highwaymen receive differ according to l:he
degree of enormity of their crimes. In this respect, Allah, li.'Calted be He, says~
''It1deed, thl} ~11alty for those wl,o wage war qgatnst AU11h arrd
His Messenger and slnive upo11 <41·tll {lo cause] cormption is none

(Qur'an: AI-Ma'id'ah: 33)

According to the opjnion adopted by the majbl'ity ofthe Sala(( earlyMuslim
s,;hofars), !his,noble verse was revealed regatding,tbe highw~ymen , and this is
the base on which they founi.led their judgments. With regard to this, Imam
Ash-SMfa' l related that tbn ' Abbas (may Allah be pleased wlth him) said:

'1/ t/ie highwaymen kill and seize people's propertie.~. they must be
killed and crucified. ifthey kill but do not seize properties, they must
be killed without being r;rucifieii Moreovei; if they seize properties
without ki)liltg, their /1111111s m1d feet are to be nit offfrom opposite
sides. Tf they only terrorize people on ways without seizing 1/reir
properties, /hey are to be exiled from the land."
lf some highwaymen commil murder, the death sentence must be passed
on them all lf some of them commit murdet and otl1ers seize the property, all
of !hem are to be killed and crucified.

If one of such bandits repents. before, being apprehended, the penalties
prescribed concerning his crime, such as exile, ao1putating a hand and a foot and
inevi1ability of killing, are to be annulled, However, the rights owed to human~
must be redeemed, 'be It a soul, a limb, or a property (nso fulfillment ofq~a,,, i.e.,
l'egal retribution), ncepl if the bandit is pardoned by the. rightful claimers. This
ts based on the noble Qur'ank verse in which Allah , Exalted be Hei says:
"F.)cceptfor tlrose wl,o retur11 Jrepentl11g] beforey ou overcome
(i.e., apprehend] them. And k;tow tJ,at Allah is Forgiv1,1g
and Merciful."
(QurYtn: Al Ma'idah! 34)
0

Io this respect, Shaykh11l-ls!Am, Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy tm
him) said:

"M11s/im scholars have wianimously agreed t/1111 if t1 highwayma,1, 11
t!u'ef and their like are brought to jll5tice before lh~ r11le1; ur t'he'fudge,
and they repe11t,afterwards, tile prescribed penalty imposed on them is
not ann11/led, but it must be executed eve11 if they repent sincereJy."'
Thus, tlie exception of repenta11ce me11tioned in !he noble ver~e i~ on!)'
applicable before they are apprehended. So, the one who -is- penitent after being
apprehended is still considered among those on whom 1he Jegal penalty must
be exec11ted. This is based on the general meaning indicated in th~ previous
ouble verse. Moreover, accepting the repentance of the bandit after being
avprehended may be L1sed as a means to saspend executing the legal penalties
prescribed by Allah. That is, it is easy for the one 011 whom the penalty must
be exec11ted to pretend that he has repented in, order·to be pa,·doned fot the
offenses he has committed.

"lt is well-known that people do 11ot thrive =ept with the prese11ce of

better for people to have an 1mji1st rule,: ti/mi 1ione, 11 is said that: ci

Thus, if a group of people who are strong and powerful revolt against
che leader on lhe basis of mishHel'J'retation. aiming to dethrone him or
oppose him and 10 sow the seeds of dissent among people and disrupt their
unity. they are considered rebels, wllo are oppressors and transgressors. In
such a case, the J'eader must send ,to 1hem asking them about the reason
behind their rebellion. Jf they complain about ,my act of lnjosrice, he should
eliminate· it, and if they claim an undear matter, he should dear it. Allah,
Exalted be He, says:
"... then make settlement betwee11 the 1wo.• ,"

(Qur'an; Al-Hujurat; ?)
Thus, the peacemaking should be implemented in such a way. i( what they
hold against falls undef what is prohibited, he must remove it; however, if it
is lawful but they misconceive the matter belleving that .it is prohibited, he is
to clarify the proof of its le_gilimacy aod reveal its trulh to them. After that,if
they 'return to the right path and sho,v allegiance, he should leave them, but if
they insist on disobediQnce, he mu:sr by law f.ight against them and his subjects
must support him. Allah. Exalted !>e He, snys:
•...Then fight against /he one ll1at oppresses rmtH it returns to

Accolilingly, fighliIJg the rebels is obllga!'ory in order to ward off their evll

In fighting ;1gai~st rebei~ the following matters
should be taken into considers,tion;
First: It is prohibited to use weapons of mass destruc1ioli. \vhile fighting

Apostasy
Linguistically, the word "apostasy" in Arabic is derived from "turning back"
or "backsliding''. So, an apostate is a backslider; Allah, Exalted be He, says:

•~ .. and do 11ot turn back..."

(Qur'an: Al-Ma'idah: 21)

That is, do not backslide.
According to the religious terminology, an apostate is the one who willingly
disbelieves after embracing Islam, ,vhether through utterance, belief, doubt,
or action.
There are prescribed peoalties imposed on the apostate in this world and
in the Hereafter. As for his worldly punishment, it is stated in the b.adith in
which th.e Prophet (PBUH) says:

"if anyone (Muslim) changes his religion (i.e. apostatizes), kill him."'
There is consensus among Muslim scholars on this judgment and its
relevant rulings, such as separating bctwec.n the apostate and his wife and
preventing him from disposing of his property before killing him.

638

X PRESCRIBED AND DtSCllli'l'IONARY l'0NISHMENTS

As regards the prescribed punishment awaiting the apostate· in the
Hereafter, Allah, Exalted be He, states it in the Qur'1rnic verse.that readst

"...And whoever of ;110" reverts from Iris rellgion [to disbelief/
and dies whJJe lie is a disbeliever - for those, tl,eir deeds have
become wort/1/eu 111 this worl,t and the Hereafter, and thase #re
Jl,e companions,of tl1te Fi~; they will abide therti,i eter11aJ~1."
{Quran: AI-Baqarah: 217)
Apostasy takei; place by committing,one of the breaches of Islam, whether
seriously, pla)'fully, or mockingly. Allah, Exalted be He, says:

•~4 if you asfc th,em, they will Sttrely say, 'We were 011/y
conversi11g 1J11d p/a;vl11g.' Say, 'Is i t Allah and His •verses and
His Messe,iger thatyo11 were mocking?' Make no excuse; you
have disbelieved ( i.,e. rejected faith J1,jter yo11r belief .."
(Qur'an: At-Tawbah: 65 -66)
However. if a Muslim is compelled to utter words of disbefief, he is not
regarded as an apostate, as A Uah, E. :altecl be He, says:

"'Wlroever disbelieves iii [i.e. de1,ieJ] Al/al, after l1fs belkf. .. except
for one who is forced [to nno,mce /,Is rclfglon./ while his heart Is
-sec11rein/ait/1 ..."
(Qur'.in: An-Nahl: 106)

The Breaches of ]slam by Which Apostasy Talces Place are Many
The mos't grievous among them is associating others in worship with
Allab, Ex;ilted be He. For example, some people ass(1ciatc others in worship
with Allah, such as supplical'ing the dead, the faithful servants of Allah, and
the righteous people, slai1ghterit1g sacri6cial animals for their graves, vowing·
ro them, or seeking help and support from the dead as grave worshippers do
oow11d<1ys. So, whoever commits any of such a~s of association is considered
to haveapo~tatized. Allah. fum!tedbe He. says:

"Indeed, All,1/1 does not forgive associatio11 with f!i1t1, but He
forgives what is less than that for whoin He wills ..."
(Qur'a n\ An-Nist: 48)
ln t his connection, Shaykhul-lsl'1m lbn Taymiyah. said:

,. Whoever i11nkes medin,ro1'$ between Allah and himself, supplicalfrlg
them, seeking their aid, 1111d p111t'i11g his trust in them, has $1trel)'
disbelieved nccording to the consensus of Mmlim .~dwl,1rs."'

G:19

Furthermore, whoever denit!S some of Allah's messengers or some of
the Divine Books has surely apostatized. as he disbelieves Allah and denies
one of His messengers or one of His Books. The same applies to whoever
denies the angels or the resurrei:tion after death; whoever does this ,is an
apostate, as he thus disbelieves Allah's Book (the Qur'an), the Sunnah
(Prophetic Tradition), imd the (:ouseosus of Muslim scholars. Moreover,
whoever disparages or revile.s Allah, .Exalted be He, or any ofHls prophets,
is considered a disbeliever.

Similarly. whoever claims prophelhoocl, or believes ill anylihe who clai)ll.!:
prophethood after Prophet Muhammad {PBUHJ, is considered a disbeliever.
Thi~ is because such peo!'le thu:s deny the Qur'anic verse in which Allah,
Exaited be He. says:

u

''Mu!Yumnad 11e1t theJii111erof{any] om, of}'our me111 but·[he is]
the ,nesse11ger of.Allah a111heal [i.e. the last] of the propl1etJ..."

(Qur'an: AI-Ab.zab: 40}
Moreover, whoever denies the prohibition of' adultery (fornication and
sodomy), or denies the unlawfulness of any of the consensually and obviously
prohibited things. such as eating the flesh of swi.ne, drinking intoxicants, is
regarded as an apostate. 'fhe b,inne applies to .whoever prohibits something,
consensually and indisputably lawl1til, such·as the lawful slaughter of the animals
of grazing livestock.
The same aiso applies to whoever denies the obligation of ~ny of the
prescribed five acts of worship me,ntioned in the following/:!adlth in which the
Prophet (PBUH) says:
"Islam is built on (the following) };ve (principles): Testifying that
there is no deity but .Allah ~tnd 1/i,11 Muhammad is the Messenger
of Allah, e,tablisliing the (compulsory congregatlnnal) Prayers
dutiji1/ly mid per:fectly, pa)"ing tl1e Zaka.h, f11stirtg the mo11t/1 of
Ramadan, and p etfo,-ming .fiajj (Pilgri11rnge) lo the Sacred House

ofAllah (i.e. the Ka 'bah)."
Whoever denies any of tlietm is deemed an apostate. Additionally,
whoever mocks religion, despises the Noble Qur'an. O:r alleges that
something of the Qur'an is lost. missing, or concealed, is indisputably
.regarded as a disbeliever.

doubting their disbelief, or deeming ·t11t:ir creed valid are acts of apostasy, and

brought by the Mes.qenger of Allah (PBUH}, mocking something related to
the religion of the Messenger of Allah (P.BUH), ,ind denying a certllin reward
or pw1ishment stated by him are acls of apostasy. Moreover, supporting the
infidels and helping them against Muslims are acts of apostasy. The same
applies to those who believe that some people are ·permitted to deviate from

·Sufu; they are regarded as apostates. Likewise, those who tum away from the
Religion of Allah, lslam" refraining from ]earning ii or acting according to

Owrng to the fuc.t that i3postasy is caused by doubt and is not dispelled dl
ont"e, a resp1te mu.st be _gi\reo to tne apost;1te before killing him that he may
meditate .a nd recant. As fo, the proof of the obligation of killing th,e apostate if
he does not repent, the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"lf a,,yone (Muslim) c/ra11gcs hii re/igio/t (i,e. ~ostatizes), kill him."
(Related by Al-.Bukhart and Abo Dawud)''
The killing ofan aposta11e mllst: be handled by th~ judge or his deputy, for it
Is a punishment for violatin,g one of the Rights of Allah, so it i~ the duty of the
one ill nuthority to establish it. 'IM wisdom behind the obligation of killing
the apostate is the fact thnt he has known the Religion of Truth and tben
abandoned it. Thus, he hos become a corrupt person who rtt'l longer deserves
lo live; he has become a COl'rupted member that may harm the sociel)' a~ well
as the Religion of Islam.
Repentance·it fulfllled hy uttering the Two 'Iestificalion&of Faith. due ro

Ar, for an apostate whose apostasy iS' ~5ed on the denial of one of d\e

Thus, the.debt$of an apostale, his own expanses, and the expenses of his family

his property and he Is enaq,led lo dispos~ of it once again, as the reason for
preventing him from dispos,ing of !us property is. no longer there. However. J:f
the apostate dies without l'ei:,i.t1lntioo, or gets lciU~d while.5till an apostate. his
property becomes fay' (i.e. sipoils gained without fightiog•or war) belo11ging to
the Muslims' P11blic Tre~sury, This is becnuse an apostate is supposed to bave

Some of then, ,U-6 of tne opinion that bis repentance is not accepted as regards

Like\\~Se, Muslim scholars (may Allah have merC)' on them all) have

Allah, Exalted be He, says:

However, another group of scholars believes that his repentanct is

''Say to those tt•ho ha,•e; di,;belie1•ed {that} if they cease, what has

(Qµr'~n: Al-Aural: 38)

Scholars liuve also disagreed regardlng the acceprance of the repentancu>f
a hypocrite, who pretends to be a Muslim and ~ides disbelief. Some scholars
maintain that 'the repentance of such a person is not accepted, as he cannot
s'how,u:iy more signs of his reversion to Islam. Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"Except far those who r~ent and correct tl1emS11lves and make

(Qur'an: Af-Baqarah: 160)
Thut is to say, if suGh hyponi1·es declare repentance and try lo show sigrrs
of their Islam. ii will not Mi rp;iss thelr previous state, as they used to show
Islam and hide disbelief anyway.
However, some other scholars maintain that the repentance of such hypocrites ls accepted, for Allah, Exalted be He, says:

«Indeed, the hypocrites will be ii, the lowest depths of the Fire

Allah, Exalted be He, also s:ays:

"B11tifthey repent, estiablishprayer, iu1dgi-veZakah, tf1eri they

(Qur'an: At-Tawbah: 11)
The aforementioned noble Qur'anic verse indicat~s tha~whoever does no1
perform prayer is not one of.our fellow Muslim brothers, 11nless he ·•establishes"
prayer, as mentione~ ·i n the verse, not only ackrlowledges'its being obligatory.
Moreovei:, the Propnet (PBUH) said:

~Islam is bttilt on (the Joilowing) five (priiiciples): Testifying that
tliere is no deity but Alla,& a11d that M11h.m11mad is the Messenger
of Ailah, establishing t/1,e (compu'5ory co11gregational) prayets
dutifully and perfectf.y.. ,"
The Prophet (PBUH) did n«Jt say, «acls,riowledging the obligation of prnyer;'
but he &aid. "establishi1.1g praye,•s."
Unfotlunately, slackness amd negligence regarding prayer have become
so recurrent nowadays, H is really a serious matte1; so those people who are
negl.igent of prayer have lo repent to Allah and rescue themselves from ttellfire.
as prayer is the basic pillar of Islam thar s'1fegµards one against Immorality,
wrongdoing. and sin.

Food
Food is the means of nouri.shment of the human body, and its effect is
reflected on man's behavior and conduct; hence, good lawful food has a good
effect on the human being, and evil food has an evil effect. For this reason,
Allah, Exalted be He, has commanded His servants to eat good lawful food,
and has forbidden them from ea1ting what is unlawful. This is illustrated in the
following verses:
• Allah, Exalted be He, says.:
"O mankind, eat from whatever is on earth [that is] lawful
and good..."
(Qur'an: Al -Baqarah: 168)

• Allah, the Almighty, also :says:

''O you who have believed, eat from the good {i.e., lawful] things
which We have provide~! for you and be grateful to Allah if ii is
{indeed} Him that you worship."
(Qur'an: AJ-Baqarah: 172)

• In addltlon. Allah, E·xalted be He, says:
•''O messengers, eatfrmt1 the goodfoods at1d work rigllteo11sness.

(Qur'an: Al-M,/rriin O,m 51)
• ,\llali, the Exalted, aJs;Q says~
~say, 'Who has forbidden the 4dorn111enr ,of {Le,, from} AU1Jh
wllidi He h1Js J?rod11ced for Hu servams arid the good [lawful]
thingS" ofprovu/ou?'"
(Qur'an: Al-A· raf: 32)
Linguistlcally, food is generally everything that can be eaten or drunk, and
all.kinds of food atMJriginallJ/ iawfol according to the general meaning of the
noble verse:
"It ls Ile Wl,o ci·esued for yo11 a/I of that 'l'hillh Is on thee4rth..."

(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 29)
rn addition to this verse, t here are many legal texts in the Qur'an and the
Sunnah, which tndicate that all kinds of food are originally lawful except What
is particularly excluded.
With regard to this, Shaykhu.1-blam lbn Taymiyah says;
•The basic mle is that all good kind1 offood are lmvfulfor the Muslim
w'ho does lqwful rleeds. I'lwt is; Allah, the Almighty, h,,.s made lawful
the good food for those who make 1,.se qf it In obcyi11g Him, not iii
disobedience. As a11, illttdralio11 to this, Allah, Exalted be I-le, says,
'There Is not upo,1 tliose who believe and do rigl1teousness (any]
blame concerning wl1at1hey have eaten [i.11 the past} ...' (Qur'an: Al-

Ma"idah: 93) Tlterefare, ,;t is impermissible to 11tUize w/wt is lawful in
disobeying Allah. For extm1ple, it Is 1101 permissible to give meaf and
firead lo someo11e who drinks alcohol a11dcommi/s immoralirie.1. Those
who cat from the la~fiil food and do 1101 th,ink Allah for this blessing,
are censured, for Alla/·~ the Almighty, says, 'The11 you will $Ure/y be
,uked that Day about pl,iasure! (Qur'dn: Al-Kowthar: 8) •'
The verse means that om: \"1ll be asked on the Day of Judgment wbetheF
one h.is thanked Allah in return for this pleasure or not. Allah, Exalted be He,
has allowed the believers to ,wail themselves of the lawful things as indicated
in the following noble verse:
~They ask you, [O Mul!1JmmaJJ, what has been tmJde lawful for
them. Say, 'Lawf1fl fa , yo11 are {all] gaodfaod1.. .''

(Qur'tn: AI- Mfidah: 4)

Chapter I: foud

Allah has clarified to His servants what He has forbidden fhem 10 e~t or
drink, a&He says:
~... He h11s explained in detail to you w/iat He. htu jol'bidden yo"i
e.tcepting tliat,lo which yori (Ire wmpelled..."

(Qur'an: Al-An ' am! 119)
Thus, any food that is not E•rohibited by Allah i» deemed lawful, ~Sillus.t.rated in the fullowing b.,iditlt 111 which the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"Allah Almighty amt Ever•lvfaje.stic be. ffe, has made obligations
so do not neglect tliem, and .He has set limits so do not transgress
them, and He. has prohibitet,i things so do not violate them, 111111
He, has not made a mention of(other) things (i.e., He has nei:ther
decreed them lawful nor proliibited) not out offorgetft1Jness .10 do
not seek to 1..--riow them."'
Imam An-Nawawt (may Allah have mercy 011 him) commented on this
lladiih saying, "This is a /!as,m (goo•d) lladit/1 which Is related by Ad·DdrCUJutni

and other compilers of Hadith."
Any kind of food, drink or clothe$ that is not prohibited by Allah or His
Messenger (PBUH) is considered lawful and it is Jmpermi$sible ro prohibit
iL That is beca1.15e Allah, Exalted be He, has defined and explained to us
what is prohibited; thus, whatever Allah prohibits is weU-explained. As it is
impermissible to sanotion what is prohibited, ir is also impermissible to prohjbit
what AUah has decreed as lawful and bas not m.entio11ed as prohibjted.
The rule of thumb in this reg,ird is that any pure and harmless rood Is
lawful, in contrast to the impure food, such i\S the meat of dead animals, blood,
droppings, urine, liquor, hashish, aod anything defiled with an impure ob)ed.
All Such things nre forbidden, as they are all evil and liarmful, based an \lie
following verse in which Allah, the Almighty, says,
"Proliibited to yo11 are dead a11imals, blood, the jksh ofswine..."'

(Qur'an: Al-Ma'idah: 3)
As for the dead, it is the nni:mn1 that dies without being slaughtered
accocding to the legal way of slaughtering. It is forbidden by reason of bell1g
an evil food, as one's pur1ty is surely affected by the kind ·a£ food one eats.
Prohibiting such kinds of food is (>oe of t he virt\les of lhe Shari 'ah (I;liimic
Law). J,fowever, if one is compelled to eat such a food , it is lawful for him to do
so and the aspect of being Impure and evil is l1UIIUled Under the circumstances

XJ JiOOD
of nei;essity, This Is be,ausi, l1'1e evil impure effect of the evil food is only there
when one i.s willlng lo ai:cept e.ating such a 1tind of food. So, when one .is
obliged, under the circw11s t~nc.es of necessity, to eat such. a food, ones purity
is not affected by eating ii, ,1s the bad effect only happens when one voluntarily
eatr. suoh an evil food. Thus, when there is no choice other than eating evil
food, there is .no harm in e,lting it.

As fur blood, it is the biood shed as a result of slabghlering an animal.
People of the Pre-lslamic '.Period of lg11orance (AT-ftlliiliyyah) used to put it
in the i:ntrail~, griU it ~nd eat it, liowever, whatever blood remaining inside
the flesh of the s)aughterecl anim:\I or in the ve:ins is lawful. Rather. it is not
considered Impure even if ohe touches it 1vith the hand or with a piece oJ
cotton for example and it Je;aves visible trnce5. ln this respect, Shaykhul,Islam
Ibo Taymiy.ah (may Allah have mercy on him) says:

''The right opinion is tfml the blood t/iat Is forbidden is l!ie sired. the
spilled or the poured blood; howe.ver, tire blood left in the veins is 1wt
deemed prohibited by any ofMuslim sdioian."'
Moreover, it is ptohiblted to have any kind of food or diink that causes
harm to the body, ~uch ali poison. !ntoxicapts, hashish, or tobacco. Allah,
Exnlred be He, says:

"; .. And ,lo not-lhmw jyonrselves] with your {own} hands Imo
destruction ..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 195)
This noble Qur'anic·ve1rse indicates lhc prohibition of eating or drinking
.inything that may cause ha.rm. ln addition, there are many other legal proofs
that ernphasi2e the prohibition of any kind of food or drink that may be
harmful either to one's mind or body.
Lawful kinds of food ar,e·<Uvided 1nto !wo kinds: aqima1s and plants rucn
as cereals and fruits. Thus, ruiy harmless kind of foocl 'is lawful. Animals iu
turn are divided into two kinds: land animnis and sea animals. Land animals
are lawf\11 ,except those typ"s prohibited by the Lawgiver of Slmrl •11h and they
are as follows'.
• The domestic do11kcJs; this is illustrated in the l.!adith narrated by Jabir
(may Allah be _plea,;ed wilb him} who !ias said:

' The Propliet (PBUH) forbade (en ting) the meal of domestic, donkeys
tmd he pennitted t!ie (eatil.lg of the) meat of horses.~'

Ibnul-Mundhir ~ays, "Tl1ere is ho disagree,111ml amongMuslihHcholars

• Land animals that have fangs used for preying are afso prohibited,
according to the h.adith narrated by Abu Tha ' labah Al-Khushania (may
Allah be pleased with him) who has said:

"The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) prohibited eating any of t!te fanged

(•Related by AI-Bukh~rt-and Muslim)
There is only one exception to,this ruliqg and that is the hyena: it is
lawful to eat its meat as indicated in th.e l!adith narrated by Ji\bir (rnay
Allan be pleased with him) a.,;:

"The Messenger of Alla}t (P1JUH) ordered us to eat (tlie flesh of)·hyenaf
In thi's ronnection, the greai sollo!ar lbnul•Qayyim (may Allah have

• Among the birds that are forbidden to be eaten arc those which feed
on carrions, like vultttres an<l crows, Ol>'ing to the evil food 'they feed
on. It is also prol\ tbited to eat the animals that are considered fuul,
such as snakes. rats. and insect:i;. Shaykhul-Islim lbn Taymiyah (may

• As mentioned above, it is prohibited to eat insects, as they are injltfious.
Amons the animals th2,l are prohibited is whatever is bom as a result of
copulation between an animal that is luwful to be eaten and another animal
prohibited to be eaten, such as the mule, which is the offspring ofa horse and a
domestic donkey. Tbe reason behl nd prohibiti11g fhe eating Qf such an anirnal
is giving priorily to the aspnct of prohibition over that of lawfulness.

Some Muslim scholars have classified the land animals prohibi\ed to be
eaten in six types:

,) An~ particulaJ·ly stared in the Qur'lir, and S1.mru1!, such ;is the
domestic donkeys
2) Animals restricted by c1.>1-tain characteristi cs and criteria, like the
fanged beasts of pri:y and the birds with talons
3) Whatever fe,eds on rnrrions, like vultures and crows
4) Whatever is perniciious and injurious, like rats and snakes
5) Whate1•er is borri as a result of copulation between two a,timals, oae ot'
which ls lawful to be eaten and the other is prohibited, like the mule

All other animals and birds that are not included tinder the above~
mentaoned-categories are ,;oosidered lawful according to the. rule stating that
any thing is deemed 'lawful until proved otherwlse. The examples of such
anll1)als are horses, animals of grazing livestock, poultry, zebras, antelopes,
ostriches. ralibits and other wild animals. All these animal~ care considered
good food. so they are includ(d under the meaning of the Qur'anic verse i n
which. Allah, Exalted be lie. says:

(Qur'an; Al-A' raf: 157)
The jallalah" of cows and camels are excluded from being of lawful food.
lmdm Ahmad, Abu Diiwlid ancl other compilers of Hadit1r have related that
Ibn 'Umar (may AJlah be pleased with him) has said:.
''The Messenger ofAllah (PBUH) forbade eating jaUdlah or (drittking) its milk:'"
[tis also related on the authority of · Amr Tbn Shu' ayb that the Messenger
of Allah (PBUH) forbade eating the meal of domestic donkeys and (forbade)
tldlng jallalah or eating its meat ". lt does not mnke any difference whether
the jaJialah is from the animals of grazing livestock, poultry or other animals,
Moreover, its milk ruid eggs nre also considered impure until the animal is
det;tined for three days" and fed on pure fodder only. In thls regard, Ibnul"
Qayyim says:

"Miis/im scliolaN have una11imously agreed that if the nnitna/ is fed

If any one is compelled by necessity to eat a prohibited food other than

in tl1e noble verse in which Allnh, Exalted'be He, says:

(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 173)
Also, if any9ne is compeOed to eat from the food of others, provided that
the owiie( of such a food does not face the same circumstanD!s of compulsion;
the former- n;mst be offered whntever may keep him alive in return for paying

compensation in rewl'n for food, for feeding the hungry and clothing
Ilic naked is a collective duty, and it becomes an individual duty" 011
the person other than whom no 011e cart undertake such a•duty:•••
Moreover, if someone is compelled to use the properties of others without
consuming such property, like using clorhes to protect the body from coldness,
a rope Qr a buckel to obtain wnter, or a cooking pot, he must be given such
things at no cost, provided that the owner is not in need of them. This is
becat1se Allah, the Almighty, has dispraised-withholding such thing5 from the
poor in the Qur'anic verse:

·?1 nd withhold [simpleJauistance."

(Qur'm: Al-Ma' im: 7)

Commenting on this noble verse, Ibo • Abbas, Jbn Mas' Od and ~the rs said:
"Tltls verse refers to tlte utensils people share and borrow among
themselves such as axes, pots, buckets and the like.""'
Lt is permissible for a passerby to eat from the fruits of a garden that bas
neither a fence nor a guard, whether the fruits are still Ofl the tr~. or h.ive
fallen to the ground. However, one has no right to carry anything of ir. This is
the opinion adopted by-l b1l ' Abbas, AJ1aslbn Malik-and others. Yet. one is not
to climb a tree, nor aim ilt if with a thing, nor ear from collected fruits, exa!pl
in case of necessity,

In shori, a person passing by a garden Is allowed to eat form its fruit~
provided that the following ~onditions are fulfilled:

First: Tt must have neither a fen9e nor a guard.
Second: The fruits must be either still on the.trees or fallen to the ground
but not collected.

Third: He must not dimb o rrce; but just pick the fruits withou~ascending.

Fourth: He must cnrr_y nothing of it with him.
Fifth: He must be in need of such food as stipulated by the majority of

Accordingly. If any of the above-ine11lioned conditlons is nor fulfilled, one
is not permitted to cat from such a garden.
A Muslim should host a Muslim trmreling ihrough villages, .for ii day and Ii
night. flowever, in towns providing accommodation, it is not obligatory because
resraurants and hotels can lie found th~r~i11, w. lhe traveler is not in need of
being hosted, in contrast to the C(ISe in -villages and deserts. Hosting a Muslin,
passenger is a duty according to the h.adtt/1 in which the Prophet (PBUH) says;

"Whoever believes in Allah and tire Last Day should serve his guest
generously by giving him his reward." They (the Companions)
11sked. 1'W/1at is his reward, 0 Messenger of Allah?'' He (P8UH)
s,#d, "(To be entertnfncdgericrously)ji,r 11 day and a night."
(Related by Al-Bukhar1 and Muslim)''
The /iadllh proves tbat basting a passenger is• a duty as indicated in tbe
phrase "Whoever believes III Alla/r.._, wl1ich indicates that one's true faith is
,dependent on showi11g hospitality to one'.s guest, II was also related in the Two
SJ1/11hs"' that the Messenger of Alfah ('P.BUR) llaia:

"Ifyou stay with some people and they entertni,, you as t/rey should
M for il guest, accept their hospitality, but if t/rej do r,ot, take from
them the right ofthe guest they should offer.""
'!'.he story of Allah's Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) (PBlJH) ,vith his guests,
which shows how he entertained them with a calf. indicates that ht'ISpitalityis-a
c:ha.raGteristicof the religion of the Pcophet lbr~liim (PUBH). It also sliow.; tbaL
one should offer the guests more than what one usually eats. This is one of the
vl'rtues and noble merits of this religion which remained 1hroughout Ibrahim's
bl'l'spring until Islam came, stressecl them-and urged Muslims to adhere to them.
Moreover, [slam has entitled the wayfnret a right among the ltm due rights
mentioned ju the noble Qur'ani:c verse fn which. Allah, the Almighty, says:

Slatllghtering
Slaughtering land animals ac,cording to the rules of the Shari'11h (Islamic
Law) is a prerequisite to make an animal's meat lawful to be eaten; otherwise,
it will be considered a dead animal whose meat is prohibited. for this reason,
studying the rules of slaughtering and whatever is related to it has become of
great importance.

Faqihs (may Allah have me1·cy on them) have defined slaughtering as:
slaying a land animal lawful to be eaten by cutting its throat and esophagus, or
wounding the animal that cannot be slaughtered, for being wild for instance.
Allah, the Exalted, says:
"Prohibited to you are d.ead animals, blood, the flesh of swine,
and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, and
[those animals] killed by strangling or by a viole11t blow or by a
headlong fall or by the goring of hams, a,1d those from which a
wild a11/mal has eaten, e·x cept what yo11 {are able to] sla11ghter
(Qur'an: Al-Ma'idah: 3)
{before its death]..."

That is to say, the ammltl that can be slaughtered before ii dies is d~emed
lawful; It does not matter whether the act of ~laughtering is a ~econd §lep after
first injuring the animai or i.t is the fu:st step.
Slaughtering is obligatory nnd the meat of the animal is not considered
lawful unfoss it is slaugbtere,d according to the rulings of Shari 'ah. Therefore,
the anlmal that is not slaughtered In such a way ls considered dead and there is
a consensus amon,g Muslim scholars Lhal the dead animal's' meat is prohibited
lo be eaten except in case of necessity, Allah, the Exalted, says:

"Prohibittd to you lire dend animals. .."
(Qu.r'ful: Al-Ma'idah: 3)

Locust~. fish, and all sea animals are lawful 16 be eaten without slaughtering,
for the. dead animaJs,of the1:ea are lawti.il. This is based on the l!adit/1 narrated
by 11:m ' Umar who narrated that the Messenger of Allah (fBUH) said:

"Two dead (m1imals) ,ind hvo (organs containingJ,'b/ood have been
1nade 11,:zwfal to us (Mu~lims). The two dead (animals) are.the whaie
and the locust, and t/1,~ two (organs co111aining) blood are the liver
and the spleen."
(Related by lmlm Ahmad and other compilers of Hadith)'.
'l'he Profhe\ (PBlJH),al:io ~id regarding sea animals:

"Tt (the sea) is that wllwsc water is pure and whose dead animals
'(the fish) are lawjuJ (to em),"'

There are Four Conditions for Lawful Slaughtering
The First Condition: The slaughterer must be legally competeqt That
is. the· one who perfonns slaughtering must be S'ane, professing a heavenly
religion, i.e., a Muslim or a person belonging ro the People of the' Scriptur~
Thus,.what~ver is slaughtenid by an insane. a drunk or a child under the age
of di~cretion , is judged as- ~•nlawful, due to the invalidity of the i11tention of
slaughtering from any of such persoll~ for their lack of discretion. It is also
unlawful to eat what is slac,ghtered by an ldolater, a Magus, an apostate; or
the one who resorts to grnv;,yards and seeks the help of the dead, because tl is
·considered a sort of major polytheism.,
Nev:ertheless. the slaughtering d6ne hy disbelieve.rs, who belo11g to the
People of the Scripture, Jew:, and Chr1stlans; is deemed lawful1. ln this,i-egard,
A'llah, Exalted be He. says:

•~ .. and the food oftl105e,,vho wen given the Scrlp~re is lal"ful
for you .. .''
(Qur'an: AI-MA'iclah: 5)

That is to say, Allah has allowed us1 Muslims. to eat whatever is slaughtered
by a Jew or a Christian. It is worth mentioning ,that there is .1 consensus among
Muslim scholars regarding this matter. Cmam AJ-Bilkhl\ri (may Allah have
mercy on him) related that lbn ' Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) said':
"The food meant irJ 1he versf is their slaughtered animals."'

11 is also indicated in the mel!tning of the afort>mentioned verse that it is
unlawful to eat what is slaughtered by a disbeliever who does not belong to the
People of the Scripture. which is.in unanimously agreed upon opinion.
lt is ,permitted to eat the animals slaughtered by the disbeliever who
belongs to the People of the Scripture in contrast to those slaughtered hy other
di,believers. This· is because the People of the Scripture, Jews and Christians.
believe in the prohibition of slaughtering animals for other than Allah and
-;tlso believe in the prohlbition of d,ead animals, based on the teachings of their
Prophets. Contrarily. other disbellievers may slaughter animals for the sake of
idols and regard the dead animals as lawful.

The Second Condition: Availability of a tool for slaughtering.
SJ.aughteripg is permitted wit4 any sharp-edg_
ed wol that causes biood to gush.
This tool may be made of iron, stoile or othermaterials. .Huwever, it is unlawful
IQ slaughter aJ1 animal using a 1001th or a claw as a tool. This is according to the
!1ad1th jp. which the Prophet (PB'Cf}I) said:
"if the slaughtering tool cau,ses b'lood Jo gush arui if t/1e Name of
Allah is mentioned, eat (of the slaughtered animal); but. do not
5/aughter using a tooth or a i"aiL"

(Related by Al-Suk.hart and Muslim)'
With regard to this badtth, Iniim Thnlil-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy
on hiin) says:
"The l!adith warn.s us rmt co slaughter using a bo111?, either because
50,ne bones may be impr,,re,. or because slaughtering with a bone

Concerning the way of slaughtering camels, it is an ac_t of the S111111ah

of its chest, whereas other animals are slaughtered by cutting the throat. The
reason behii1d specifying siuch particular parts 111 the body of the animal to
be C\U while sla\,ghtering is to ensure the blood gushes out. Such spots are the
junction of veins. Therefon:, this will make the slaughtering fuster, the meat
more delicious, and this wiill cause l<!!is pain to the slaughtered animal. The
Prophet (PBUH) say~;

• 1t is detestable to sharpen the knife, the slaughtering tool while being seen
by the animal. This is based on the l!adlth re)ated,by lmlm Ahmad as the
Messenger of Allah (PBUH) ordered U!at knives should be sharpened
and that they (knives} should be hidden from the animals,;_
• II is detestable to turn the animal to a ditection other than that of the

• J~ is deret.table to break the nnimal's neck or skin it before its body
becomes cool.

lt is an act of the Sunnah to slaughter the camel while it is in the standing

E[unting

Hunting means chasing and killing a lawful wild animal that cannot be
grasped easily for slaughtering.
The Islamic ruling pertaining; to hunting dictates that it is lawful to hunt an
animal for food; however, if it is dlone only for fun or sport, then it is detestable.
Likewise, it is considered prohibi1ted if any harm is caused to people's properties
or farms as a result of hunting. The legal evidence of its legitimacy in cases
other than the last one is as follows:
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

'~ .. But when you come out of ibrdm, then [you may] hu11t..."
(Qur'an: Al-Maidah: 2)
He, the Almighty. also says:
"...and [game caught by] what you have trained of hu11ting
animah which you train as Allah has taught you. So eat of w/1at

XI POOD

668

they catch for jlou, ,md mention the /\(a,nr, ofAllah of upon It..."
(Qut'~n: AJ-Ma'idah: 4)
Moreover, the Prophet ~PBU1i'l says:

"Ifyou let foo.se you,-trained dog (for hu11ting) 1111d mention Alla/i}
Name (while relerui11g it), then you may eat (th~ gam~)."
(Related by Al-Bukh:id and Muslim)

1

The Jiunted animal, tll1e game, bas either one of two cases
after being chased an~I caught:
The First.State: rt may be caught a!Jve. In such a case, the animal must be
slaughteced ac(ording to the rulesoflcgal slaughtering-as prevjouslyexplalned
in the chapter of slaughter1n,g- and i! is not tendered lawful just by hontiJ18.

The Second. State: Tlhe game may be caught killed or caught while
unstably alive. ln such cas,es, it is only.considered lawful if the following
conditions are fu1£illed:

The First Conditior.1: The bunter must fulfill the conditions of (be
competent slaughterer, oan:iely, the one who is, legally acce_pled to
slaughter. This is because the huriter assumes,th.e roleof the slaughterer
in this case. Therefore, the hllnt:er must be legally competent bybeing
.sane_. Muslim or bek,nging to the People of the Scripture (Christians or
Jews), To illustrate, i1f ts not lawfui to eat wbat is hunted by an insane or
a drunken person, fc,r their lack of discretion. Similarly, it is nut lawful'
lo eat what is hunted.by a magus, an idolater, or other disbelievers, Just
like their slaughte(e1:I animals.

The Second Couditiou: There must be a tool used in hunting. wj\ich is
one of the fo!lowing two kinds:

First: A sharpened tool, wblch must be like the one used for slaughtering
in order lo cause blb,:>d to be shed. Moreover, it must be neither a tooth
nor a fingernail, and it1nust wound the animal with its edge not by its
weight Thus, if the tool whereby the game is killed js blunt like a pebble,
a staff, a snare, a net .or a piece of iron, the hw,ted animal is considered
unlawful, acept those hunted by gun bullets. This is because this tool
posseS/les a driving force that pier~es and causes the blood to gusb out
the same as ihe ~harp tool does or even more.

Cbaprer 3, Hunrillg

669

Second! Predatory animals, su.d t as birds o( prey and hunting dogs.
The game killed by sud, animals is deemed lawful provided thauhey
are trained, whether they hunt using their fangs, like dogs, or their
claws, like birds. This is aocordlng 'to ihe noble verse in which .Ahab,
Exalted be He, sayi1:
". ..and {game c11ught l~yj what you have trained of hunting
ammals which you trai11 as Al/ah ha.s taught you. So eat of what
t/1ey catch for you, a11d 1•11e11tum theN,mre ofAllah upon it, .."
(QUc'an: Al,Mfidah; 4)

The phrase: ''. . .which y,ou train as Allah hR& taught you, .." indicates
that you have to train a1nd teach them the rules of catching the game
out of the knowledge Allah has gi·anted you. Training and teaching a
predatory bird or animal means that it should obey orders; ifit is set
,;,ff for hunting, it goes, and .if it rs summoned, il complies, and whe.n
it 1elz.cs the game, it keeps it for its master Until he reaches the hunted
antma!. and that it does not catch the .game for ,itself.
The Third Condition: To aim or set off the means, or the tool, of
hunting while having the intention of hunting. Tbis is based on the
had/th in which the Pro1phet (PBUH) says:
'"Ifyou let loose yott1: t1 :ain,1Jd. dog (Jo,· frunti11g) cmd. mention Allah's,
Name (while releasi11g ii:), then you may eat (the game).•
(Related by Al-Bukha:ri and Muslim)

T!te hadith tndicates !hat setting off a hunting bird or·anima! has the
same co11dilions of slauigh1ering. That is, one must have1:he intention
of hunting; accordingly, if the tool falls from the hunter's hand and
kills a game, this game is considere.d unlawful becaus.e of the absence
ofintention. Likewise, if a hound sets off on its own and kills a game,
the game i! considered unlawful fop the san1e reason. However, if
someone shoots at a certain game and this shot hits more than one
game. all are rendered lawful beC:luSe the hunter basically bad the
intention.of hunting.
The Fourth CondJtio,n: The hunter mu.st ptonounce tasmiyah "'hire
aiming the arrow or setting off the predatory bunting animal or biTd
as iUustrated tn the noblle ver.se:
0

And do not eat of that upon which the Name of.t,,Ual, has not
been mentioned, .."
(Qu.r'an:A1-An ' ftm: 121}

Xli FOOO

67fJ

And tbe other verse: in which Allah, the i\lrr!ighty, ,:,ays:
".., So eat of what t/1iey catch far you, and mention the Name. of

Allah upon it..!'

(Quran: Al-Ma'idah: 4)

Furthermore, the Prophet (PBUH) say5:

"'If )'OU let loose your trained dog (for h1mli11g) and mention Atlah's
Name (wltiie releqsing it), t/ie,i you may eat (the game)."
(Related by AI-Buk11,~rl and Muslim)

According to the previ.Jusly mention.ed noble verse and }iaditl,, if
Allah's Name is .nor mentioned while hunting (i.e. if the huntet· does
not say tasmiyah). the game is not TawfuL
Along With mentionfag tnsmiya/1, it is an act of the S1m11ah to glorify
All.ah by prooouncing takbtr 1vhile hunting a game, just like the case
with slaughtering. Thls ls becrnse when slaughtering, Iha froplwt
(PBUH) used to say;.

"Bismilld/1 (Tn the Name of Allah) wallt'lliil Akbar (a11d Allah is the
Greatest).°'

Two Warnings
The First Warning: There are certain cases in which hunting is
prohibited: Jt is forbidden for a 11111brim' ro kill the land gan1e, bunrit or hdp
in hullling it by giving guidance, a gesture or something elsec 'fhis 1s based pn

the noble vuse in which All11h, the Almighty. says:
"O you wlw have bci!ievcd, do 1101 kfll game w/11/e -yott are J,i the
statcofil!ram."
(Qur'an: AI-Mt idah: 95)
It is also prohibited for the mubrim to eat from the game that he has
htmteJ, helped in hunting, or lbat has been hunted for him; Allah, Ex~Jted be
He, says:

''. .. but forbidden to yo11 is game from the /1n11l as /011g as you
are in tl,e slJJte of lb#lm. A1td fear Al/11/1 to Whom yo11 will be.
g11thered,"
(Qµr'an: Al~Ma'idab: 96)
In adclitiop, acco.-dil,g to theconsensi1s ofMLislimscholars, it is prohibiled
for a ,,111!!.rim o r a npn-mul.l'"ilrl to hunt the game of Mecca. With respect to
this, lbn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated:

''On tire Day of the Co11q11esi of Mecca, tlie Mes.sehger uf Allah
(PBUH) said, 'Allah /ims made tliis ttl.Vri r;.e., Mecca) a sanrtuory

Cbiipcer 3, Hu,uing

671

sfnce Ille day He creaicd the Heavens and the Earth, and it will
remain a sanctuary by virtt/e ofthe sanctity Allah has bestowed on it
until the Day ofResurrection .. , Its trees mu.st not be wt, nor must its
game be chased; nor 111ust its wgetation or gnw be uprooted...'. ..i
The Second Warning: lt is prohibited to possess a dog for reasons other
than those permitted by the Messenget of Allah (PBUH), and they are one
of three cases: hunting. .guarding a livestock or gurutling a plantation. The
Prophet (PIJUH) said:

"He who keeps a dog except one 111ea11t for watcltlng II l!n•d, Joi·
liuntlng. or for watching field$, will lose one qiriit (i.e:, a great
amount) of his reward evety day."'
(R.dated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)
Ye!, some people care,nothirrg for such a threat and own d6gs for purposes
other than these three permitted by thtt Messenger of Allah (PBUH); they keep
dogs just for showiness and imitation of the disbelievers. They pay no attention
10 the loss of rewards resulting from wbat'lheydo, though tfthey were to lose
-anything of their worldly benefits, they would not endure it. There is neither
might nor power save in Allah! ln this connection, the Prophet (PBUH) says:

'':Angels (of Mercy) do not enter a house wherein there is a dog or a
6
picture of a living creat11re (a lmman being or 011 m,iinal).''
So, a Muslim must fear his Lord and not wrong himself by committin_g
:SUch sins and deprive himself from rewards. Indeed, Allah, Alone, is the One
Whose Help is sought.

from doing something, or 10 confirm that something is true, often calling on a
sacred object as witness. An oath has a certain way to be taken.
An oath that requires expiation if not fulfilled is that taken by calling
on the Name of Allah or on one of His Attributes, such as swearing "by
Allah," "by the Face of Allah," "by His Magnificence," "by His Glory," "by His
Sublimity," "by His Power:• "by His Mercy:' "by His Covenant," "by His Will,"
"by the Qur'an," ... etc.
It is prohibited to take an oath by calling on other than Allah, as it is
considered an act of polytheism, for the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"If one has to take an oath, one must swear by Allah or otherwise
keep quiet."
(Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)'

XI I OATHS AND VOWS

AlsQ,, he (PBUH} says:
"Whoever swears by other tfla11 Allah is committing an act of
disbelief or polytheism,•'

Furthermore.. the Prophet (PBOFI) say.s:
1

"He who .swear; by AI-A,minah Is not one of us (i.e, he does not
follow the true pathway ofM4sl/1n.s),"

(Related by Abil oawild)'
The aforementioned badiths .stnte the prohibition of gwearing by othet
than Allah ancl that it is considered an act of polytheism, Examples of such
unlawful oaths nre swearing. "By the Prophet.• "By your life." •sy Al-Amcmah:'
''By the Ka .bah:' m the like, lbn •Abdul-Barr said, "This (i.e. the ptohibitio11 <if
swearfng by other tha,, Allah) is unanimously agtetd upon.."

Sheikh Taqlyyoddinlbn Taymiyah said:
"It is prohibited to take arr oath by other t/11mAllah, and tl,is is the
opinion aded upon itt the lim1balt School. Moreover, Ib.n Mas 'Od
and otl,er; were quoted as saying. 'I would rather take a false oath by
Allah lhll11 lake a true oath by other than Allalt.' ,.,

Commenting on the aforementioned statement of lbn Mas· dd, 1bn

Taytniyah said:
"This is becau5~ tJte virt11e of monotheism is greatee than the virtue
of lruthfulness. and the, sin of telling a lie is riot so grave as that of
polytheism."•

Expiation for breaklng an oath sworn by the Name of Allah is obligatory if
the following three conditions are fulfilled:
.First; An oath must be bound with intention so as to entail expiation if
broken. That is, one must intend the oath to do a certain possible deed
in t he future. Allah, Exalted b~ He, say5:
"Allah will not impose blame iipon you for what Is rru,aningle.ss
b1 your oaths, but He will Impose blame upon yo11 for [breaking]
(Qur'an; Al, Mo'idah: 89)
what you intended f!/oaths .. ,W

'The verse indicates that expiation is not ob11gafory uniess tb·e oath is
bound with intention.
Therefore, an oath is not validly effected uniess it .refers to something
io the future, not in the past, as It i~ impossible to intend to do ot refrain

Chapter I : Oaths

Gn

from doing something in the past However, if a person delib~rately
takes a false oath that b~ had done somelrung in the past but Infact he
had not for example, such art oath is called "an immersing false oath,"
as it "immerses'' the one who commits It into sinning and, hence, into
the Hellfire. Such p\:fjury cannot be expiated for, as if is C:6nsidered
too grave to be expiated for. Furthermore, it is regarded as one of the
major sins.

IfOne uttes:s·an,o;tth unintentionally due·to a force·of habit, as.in saying,
"No>by Allah,' or "Yes, by Al111h;' ~uch are not considered oaths bound
with intention, but meaningless words. Hence, no expiation is called
for in this case, for Allah, Exalted be He. says:
"Allah wi(l not impose blame upqn you for what is me,mJngless
(Qur'an: Al-MNidah: 89)

In your oat/rs,.,"

£n ad9i1ion, ' A'ishah, the Prophet's wife, (may Allah be pleased with be()

narrated that the Prophe,\ (PBUR) said regarding a meaningless oath:

' It is the usual talk ofa man at /us home, (such as) '.No, by Alla11,' or
'Yes, by Allah.' "
(Related by Abo D~wud)'
Likewise, if one takes an oath concerning something believing it to be
trtie but later jt proves to be Untrue, such ati ilnfulfilled oath does not
entail expiation. Shaykhul•Islaan Ibn Taymiyah said:

"Thi, same r11/i11g applies to sweari11g co11ceming something in thefi1ture
believi11git will happen, aswhe11 rme·tilkes a11 oath to do somet/rfog, belining
that anoiher person will do it for him, and that person doej not''
Second: An oath mu$t be tal~en voluntar ily so as to entail expiation if
broken. Thus, if a person is forced to take an oath, his oath is nc;>t
-validJy effected. This is becatise the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"My nation i.1 pardoned Jor what th!ly commit by mistake, oul of
f orgetfulness, cmd for whcit they ,,,ere compelled to do.••
The b.aditli states that breaking an oath one has been compell~ to
take is pardoned.

Third; An oath en tails expiation if ·it is broken, ruoh as doing what
one has sworn not 10 do or refraining from what one has swam
to do, Nevertheless. if one bteaks one's oath out of forgetfulness or
comptilsion, no e:x,piation is called for, because, in such a case, one Is

not ~on6idered to have committed a sin, This is pursuant to the lladith
of the Propher (PBUH) that slates:

"My nation is pardcned for wlwi they commit by mistake, out of
forgetfulness, and /01• whai they were compelled to do."'°
Soruetim.es the one taking an oath adds a conditional phrase as an integrai
part of the wording ofthe•oaith. as in saying, ''Ry Allah, I shall do so and so, if
Allah wills.'.' In this case, ·if one fails to fulfill one's oath, one ts not considered.
to have. commitkd perjury, ,as long as the conditional phrase was an ,integral
pJU•r of the oath. The Prophet (PBUH) said:

"Tj anyone i11dudes ~( Allah wills' in his oath he will not be
considered to hav~ rommitted perjury ifIre does break his oath."
11
(Related by Imam Ahmad mid other compilers of HudftJ,)
However, .if the phrase "ilf Allah wills" is not meant to be conditional in the
oath, but only to seek Alloh'!: blessing by mentionfog His Name, the oath will
entail expiation ifbroken. LU::ewise, if this condltjonal phrase, namely'·ifAllah
wills," ls separated froni the utterance of the o~th by a pause for no reason,
this cooditional phra6e does not spare one the Cl(piation for breaking sucli an
oath. However, some other scholars malntain that the phrase, "if Allah wills:'
spares \lXpiatlon, even if it ls -uitered a while after the utterance of the, p 9th, or
even if 1he one taking the oath utlers it only after being urged by others to do
so. Shayldiul-Islam lbn 'Taymiyah cotmnenred on the latter opinion saying,
"..-.nrid thi; is the $Ound opinion".
Breaking an oath maybe Qbligalory, prohibiled or pennissibte. To illust.rare,
an oath must be broken if it•is taken lo abandoq an obligatioq, as when one
takes an oath to ·sever the li1!s of kinship. Also, an oafh must b~ broken if it
is taken to do something pmhlblte.d, sueh as swearing to drink an alcoholic
drink. In such aises, 01re mu,,t break one's oath and expiate for it
ltis prohibited co break an <>ath ifit is taken to il,bandon a prohibited deed
or to do an obligatory one. in ~uch a case, the penon has to fulfill his oath and
it is impermissible to bl'l!ak ii ..

However, it is permissible to break an uath taken to do or abandon
something permissible. The Prophet (PBUH) says:

"Whenever f ·take an oath' to do something a11d (later on) I finii
sometlting else better IQ, do, I Jo·what f find better and expiateJ"r
(breaking) my onth.""

Cbaprer f: ,0,irbt

679

The Prqphet (PBUH) aJso says:

''If anyone takes an oath to do somcth ing mid (lat~ on) finds
sometl,ing else better to do, he should do what is better and then
e:x:piate for (breaking) his oath,""
Sometimes one takes an oath to abstain from s omethingpetmissible, such
as food, drinks, or clothes, except for one'.s wife, as when one swears saying,
''By Allah, I will deem what Allah has permitted prohibited for me; or. "By
·Allah, I will deem this food prohibited for me'.' That perm1sslble thing does
not become prohibited for one to have or l!SC due to suqJ illl oath, Rathfr, i.t
is permissible for one lo have i.t or use it, yet one in this cise has to expiate for
breaking one's oath. 'This 'is because Allah Exalted be He, says:
"O Prophet, why do you prohibit [yottrselfjrom] what Allah has
made lawful for you, -seeking the approval ofyottr wives? Anil
Allah Is Forgiving and Mercifi1L Allah has already ordained for
you (Muslims). the dissolutirm. of yo11r oqth .. ."
(Qur'an~At-Tahrim: 1-2)

The word "dissolution" here refers to Uie expiation for breaking a11 oath
,taken to prohibit fur oneself something made lawful by Allah.
In case a man takes an oath to abstain from having sexual intercourse with
his wife, it is considered ~ihtir" that entails a special kind of expiation, as tl)e
expiation for breaking an oath is insufficient in this case.
fn this chapter we have·to point out the ruling on taking an oath by calling
OA a religion other than Islam, such assaying, "J will be a Jew (or a Chi;istian) iJl
do so aod so (or if I do not,do so and so):' Such oaths are abominable and strictly
prohibited. It is related ln the 'Two ~ah1!1s that the Prophet (PBUH} sa}>s:

"Whoever flltett1i0i1allJ' swears falsely by callii1g on a reiigion other
than Jsiqm (i,e. swearing-by saying that lie is a non-Muslim ir1 case he
is te1/i1rg ,die}. then he ts as he says (I.e. he·becomes a 11011-M11s1im)," 15
According to the narrailon oflmi\m Ahmad, the Prophet (PBUH) saldl
"When a11yo11e take.s an oaflt saying that he will be free from Islam
(i.e. if he is telling a lie), he will be a.s what he has said (i.e. Q 11onMuslim) if he ls lyl11g; and if he is tel/Ing the truth, he will not

We invoke Allah to prote~t us against evil spe<!cbes, and to me,nd 911r

Expiation fior a Broken Oath

Almighty Allah is so Merciful to His servants that He has decreed expiation
for broken oaths. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
':4.llah has already ordainedfor you (Muslims) the dissolution of
your oaths ..."
(Qurln: At-Tahrim: 2)

Besides, it is related in the Two ~a/:!il!s that the Prophet (PBUH) says:

"If you take an oath to do something and (later on) you find that
something else is better tha:n the first. then do the better one and
expiate for (breaking) your oath:'
There are option and priority order concerning the expiation for a broken
oath. One can choose between feeding ten needy people (half a ,!,O • ' of food
for each), clothing ten needy pe,ople (each one gets a garment proper to be
worn during performing prayer)., or freeing a Muslim slave void of defects. If
one cannot afford any of the tbre,e aforementioned choices, one has to fast for

682.

XIJ OATHS AND VOWS

three days. Hence, it is 1sfoar !hat the expiation for breaking an oath: combines
both choice and priority ord'er. Choice ts between feeding ten needy peopie,
clothing t hem, op freeing a Muslim 5lave, in !,he same ·on:ler of priority, then
comes fasting as the last ~lternative. The evidence of this ruling is tbe Q ur'anic
verse that reads;
1', . . so Its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people fro m thi<

(!Verage of that whicli you feed yo11r ( own) families .o r clothing
them or the freei~ of a slave br# who ca,inot find (or.afford
11)-the,i a fast of titre<! days (is required) ..."
(Quran: AI-MA'idah: 89)

This verse as a whole means that the expiation for breaching an oath
bound with intention is athe fudlng of ten needy people from t he av~roge of
that you feed your (own) f'atrtilies", i.e. from the best food that one normally
provides for OJ1e'6 family, 'br clothing them" with clothes proper to be worn
during performing prayer, ''or.the freeing ofa sla1•e"; most scholars agree·t hnt
this slave must be a believing Muslim. In addition, Allah ananges the order of
the three options of ex.pia1ion according to easiness, and if any of these options
is fi.1lfilled, the expiation is unanimously deemed valid. As forthe expiatory
fasting of the three d11ys, the majority of schollll's stipulate that it mu.~t be
performed successivel_y according to ' Abdullah Iba Mas' ud's· recitation of the
aforementioned ,;,erse ln which the word "successiveu is added; '".... then a fast
of1lt1'ee successive days (is required).. ." (Qur'Anc AI-Ma'idah: 89)
Nowadays, most. common people mistakenly belieye th;11 they have the
choice whether to fast or to lulfill any of the three nforem~tloned optio11$ to
expiate fot their broken oaths. Hence, they fast while t!iey can afford the feeding
o( ten needy people or clothing them, and this is not a valid expiation for a
broken oath, since fa~ting is 1101 a valid means of expiation unless 011~ cannot
afford the other alternatives. So, every Muslim must be ,iw~re of this fact.
A Muslim is permitted to make the expiation before or after breaking 'the:
oa.th. If it precedes p~jury, ii is considered dissolution of the oath, and if it
succeeds perjury, it is considered expiation for the sin ofperjury. The evidence
of this ruling is a Jjad/(h related. in tbe Two Sah.1h.s that reads:
"Ifyou take an oat/, to do somet/Jing IJfld (later orr) you find thtll
some'lhing else is better than the first, lhett do the. better one and
expiate for (breaking) )'Otir oath"'

683

This l!adit!i proves that ii is lawful to del;1y expiation uncil Jlfterbreaking
one's oath; the fladith related by Abu Pawud reads:

"...then »1ake expiatio" Jor fOuto,ith and do the bet/er one."'
The latter iladith indicates the permissibility of making expiation for <10
oath before breaking i.L Thus, the aforementioned l!ndlths slate that a Muslim
caq make expiation before or after breaking his oath.
II is an act of the Sum1a/1 (Prophetic Tradition) and ,1 duty of a Muslim
toward his Muslim brother to fulfill the latter's oath. Al-Bara' Ibo ' Azib ( may
Allah be pleased with him) ~-aid:

''The Prophet (PBUH) enjoined us to· do seven things. ffe (PBUH)
enjoined us to visit the sick,, fol/ow funeral processions, pray for a
sneezer (l>j saying to him, 'May Allah have. mercy 011 you'). fuljill a
Muslim's oat/,, /1elp the oppressed, accept invitations, and propagate
greetings (by sayirig 111he11 meetin,~ one another, 'Peace be witlt )1011.' ,..,
If an oath is repeated then broken, on~ is obJiged to expiate for it ool'y once,
as it is reg~~ed as one oath. Similatly, if one breaks an oath taken to do or
abstain from doing many things (~uch as sayil1g, "By Allah, I will neither eat,
nor drink, nor do so and so;') one, in case of non -fulfill ment, 'ha~ to expiate
for it only once, as it is considered one outh as well. Nevertheless, if one takes
more than one oath to clo or refrrun from doing more 1han one deed. and
then one breaks one's oaths, one has ro expiate for eoch of the broken oaths,
Shaykhul~Islam Ibo 1',1ymiyah (may Allah bavemercyon him) said:
•concem'ing repcatinga11 oath before expiation, there are thrt,i opi11io1,s,
the. third of them. which is tire preponderanl' one, is that if an oath
pertains to oile deed, expiating on,•e is rn/ledfor. othcnvisc expiation as
ma11y times as t/,e deeds tu whid, a,1 oat/r pertains is c11/led for." ;
lf anyone swears not to do something. then he does ii out of forgetfulness,
rompulsion, or unawareness, it i$ not deemed perjury, nor does it .e ntail
apfation. 'rhis is because Allah, Exalted be He. stnles in the Q11t'iln t hnt Hii.
righteous se)'\'.lnts Invoke Him saying:
"011r Lord, do nol i,,ipo1e blame 11pon us if we haveforgotte11

or erred..."

(Qur'an; Al-Baqarah: 286}

Furthermore, a person IS not held responsible fur a deed he is forced ·to do,
and Alla!\ forgives the Muslim nation for the sins I.hey commit by mistake, out
of forgetfulness, or while being compelled to do them.

"If one swears, out of $/iowi11g hospitality or generosity lo a.nothe11

Notice
Allah, Exalted be He, says in ihcsame verse; aher meinioning rhe expiation

for a proken oaih:
"': .. and keep up youroalll ..."

(Qur'an: Al-Mi\'idah: 89)

Therefore, Allah commands us to keep up our oaths, and this means that
one should not rush into taking oaths nor should he rush into breaking th~m,
and that broken oaths must be expiated for..ln general, this noble verse enjoins
t!ie believers to hold oaths in high esteem and not to underestimate them.
It is important to point our that some people resort to trkkery lo evade
fulfilling their oaths. mistakenly believing that thi:y, thus, have exempted
themselves from expiation and from the consequ\!flces of 1aking oaths. Iu this
regard, lbnul-Qayyim (1r1ay Allah have mercy on him) warned against such
evasion sayiug:

"Some peopla make uu/awj11I tritks fll order to evade fulftlli11g their

not to eat a certain Toof, 110/ ro live ill 11 certain house for a year, or not

It h-.ippens that mmeone ma)' swear not to oo something and tben he
makes someone else do it for hirt1 to avoid perjury. In fuel, such evasion does
not spare sucb a person the liability,Qfhis oath, unless he has already meant

Vows

Linguistically, to take a vow, in Arabic, means to obligate Ol)eself solemnly
to do something. However. according to Islamic jurisprudence, a vow is a
voluntary obligation taken by a competent, legally accountable person upon
himself to do something seeking: the pleasure of Allah, Exalted be He.
A vow is considered an act of worship that should never be meant to seek the
pleasure of anyone other thao All,ah, Exalted be He. It must not be dedicated to a
dead person in his grave, an angel, a prophet, or a righteous servant of Allah, as
one, by doin,g so, is associating pa.rtners with Allah, which is considered an act of
major polytheism that renders a person non-Muslim. as it is regarded as a kind of
worship to someone other than Allah. Accordingly, those who take vows seeking
the pleasure of the dead righteous people at their graves nowadays commit major
polytheism. May Allah prqtect us all against falling into polytheism! So, those
people who commit such acts must repent to Allah and avoid this major sin, and
warn their people against it that tlhey may fear Allah.

XU 01\l"liS AND VOWS

Mal411g vows .ls originally detest;\ble, and it is deemed proliibi!ed by a
group, ofscholats'accordlng to theb.adith narruted by Jbn ' Umar(may AUab
be pleased with him) that reads:

"Making a vow doe5 not prevent anything (related to fate), bitt it
makes a miser spend his property.'''
The compiler of tlie book entitled.Ai-M1ml11qd (the Selected) said, "Thisb.adlth
u related by the Group of tire Compilers of Hndirli a.tcluding At· Tinnidhli'' The
reason behind these two rulings is that one who make.~a vow obligates oncselfto
do ~omething that is not originally a religious obligation, and get& oneself fnto a
critical situation by such a vow, whereas a Muslim is enjoined to do good deed~
without having to make vows,

Nevertheless, if one makes a vow to perform an acl of worship, one has to
fulfill it, for Allah, Exalted be He, says:
'½nd wh<1tever you spend of ~penditures 01· make of vows i11deed, Allah /mows of it ..."
(Qur'an: Al·Baqnrah: 270)

In another verse of the Qur'an, Almighty AU ah describes His fai!hfu], pious
worshippers saying.

~TIiey [11re those ,who] fulfill {their] vows and fear- a Day wltose
evil will be widespread.''
(qur'an: Al-lnsan: 7)
AUah, t-:Xalted be He, also says:

"...and fulfill their vows..."

(Qur'an: Al-Hajji 29)

Moreover, it is related in ~a!11b.AI-Bukhari (Al-Bukhari's A1.1the11tic Book of

Faqihs (may Allah have mercy on them) stipulate that a vow must be
voluJJtarily made by a compelen r, sane, discrlminating, adult person so !IS to
be validl)' eff~cte.!i They base thi"s opinion on the !J.a,tfth in which the Prophet
(PBUH) sayg;
"There are·three (per$ons) l<>hose actions are not mrorded, A mihor
1111/i/ he reaches puberty, ci lumJtic until he comes to reaso11, arid u
sleepe,, mttil he awakes."'

This uadfth proves fhat the above-mentfoncd three kinds of people are not
obligated to fulfill any vows they may take, as thBy ar!; not legally accoun(able
for their deeds.
The vow made by a disbeliev,er is deemed valid if it is made to perform an
act of worship, and if soch a disbeliever converts to fslam, he bas to fu!Jill the
vow he has taken while being a disbeliever. ' Umar Ibnul-Khatt~b (may Allah
be pleas~d With him) narrated th,at he had once made a vow ln the Pre-Islamic
Period of[gnorance (the Jahiliyyah) to seclude in the Sacred_Mo5guefor one
night, solhe Prophet(PBUH) saiid to him: ''F11.lfil/ your yow.'',

Valid Vows are of Five Kit1ds
1- An Absolute Vow
lt is the vow made by s~yin~:, fo, example, ~l owe Allah a vow;· withoµ\
defining a certain act of worship to perform dL,e to vowing, The expiation for
such a vow is the same as thnt for;1 broken oath, whether the vow is conditionill
or not. This is because •Uqbah l'bo ' Amir (may Allah be pleased witli himJ
narrated that the Prophet (PBUH) said:
'The 1,'Xpilllio11 Jor (breaking) a vow which is not defined is t11e
$ame QS that for (bret1ki11g) cin oath."'"

(Rela1ed by lbn Miljah and At• Tirmidhi who deemed it a hasan

XII OATHS AN[) VOWS

2-A Vow Taken in aStabe oflm,portuolty or in a Fit of Anger
ll is a ,onditional vow meanr t:<> either prevent someone from doing
something. ro urge him to do it, OJ" to make someone believe something, or
disbelieve in it. For example, when one says, '''I vow to perform Ii.a}} (or free a
slave) if my speech proves u;ntrue or if I speak to you, or about you," A person
who takes such a vow may choose between fulfilling his vow and expiating for
ii jus1 like a broken oath. This is because ' Irnran Tbn H11liay11 (may Allah be
ple-.ised with him) narrated it'hat he heara the Prophet \'PSUH) saying.

"No vows take11 fr/ n jift of nnge-r (are 11alid), and i/1e expiation for
such 11 vow is tl,e smne- as thatfor (brellkirtg) an oath.''
(Related by Sa' id lbn Mnniurln his book ofHadlths)'

3- A Vow Taken to Do iu11 Ordinary, Permissible Act
An example of such a vo,w is vowing to wear one's gannent or to ride one's
pack anim31. Io this case, cone niay choose hetwcen fulfllllng one's vow and
expiating for ft lf one. refrain,s from doing the said act, the same as the expiation
for breaking l\ll oath, just lilke the second case, The opinion of lbn Taymiyah
(may Allah have mercy on him) in this r~gard is that no expfati.on whatsoe\'et
is called for in case ofbreaking a vow to perform a permissiblenct. He grounds
this rnling oo the haditl, rel,1ted by AI-Bukh~ri lh~t reads:

"Wl,ile 111e Prophet (i0BIJH) was delivering a sermon, he smv a
111a11 wlw remained s11,mdi11g, so henskedabvut lhe 1nat1. Tl,ey(lhe
people) said, 'ft is Ab,w lsflfil who has taken a 1•ow to strmd and
11e vers/C down, ,iever comein the sha,fe. nnr speak :tn anybody, and
to fast! The Prophet (PBUH) said. 'Order liim /Cl resume speaki11g,
come in lhe sh11de, and sit down, but let him complete /11'-s f11$t,' "'
4--A Vow Taken to Conunit 11.n Act of Disobedience to Allah
An eX;Qmple of such a kiind of vow is vowing to drink intoxi.catin.8 liquors
o r to fast the days of menstnrntion or the D~y of Sacrifice. It is impemiissible
to fulfill such a vow, 11s rhe Prophet (PBUHJ says:

"Whoever vows to disobey Aliah uw~t 11,11 disobey Him."
This fladlth states that it is impermissible 10 fulfill a vow tO dl'sobey Allah,
be,ause one is neverpermiued to disobey Allah under any circums~ces.
A.noth~r example of vo~<S of disobedience to Allah is the vow& taken lo be
fulfilled .it the gra"eyards seeking the pleasure of the dead buried therein.Such

691

a deed ls considered major polyLb,eisll.1 as previously mentioned, Expiation for
ijlJCha vow is the same a~ that for<1 broken oath according,to some scholars,,the
opinion which is based on the narrations oflba Mas'{1d, lbn 'Abb:ls, ' lrnr.\11
Ibn H~ayn, '11Jd Samurai\ Jbn fu1ndob (may Allah be pleased with them all).
However, some scholars maiJnlain thar a vow taken 1.0 commit an acr of
disobedience lo Allah is ,oci_ginallly invalid and it entails no ex.piatk111. Thi.s jij
one of the opinions attributed 10 lmarn Ahmad, lllld it is the opinion of the
tfanaft the Malik1, and the Shafi'i Schools. Tl is also rhe ·opinloa ma'intain~«;I'

by Shaykhul-blam lbn Taymiyah who said;
"The vows to fur-nlsh agmve, a rno,mtairt, Orl'.l lree with lig/11s, and the
vows dedicated to such places, tlteir ·i11h4biumts, or their visitors, are
impcmifssible- to be taketi; s11'clr vows are rmpcrmissible to befulfilled
as scholars utu1111'mou.sly agree. Such objects (i.e. the lamps, money.
ar whatever i,; put ir suc/t p/i,res due lo vows) lire to be gathered and
used for the benefit of lhe pub/fc, as long as the identities ,if t/ieir
owners are 1mk110w1t (to rcl11rn t/lese objects to them),"'"

5- A Vow to Perform a Pious Act
It is a vow t;ikep to perform an act of obedience to Allah, like performing
Prayer, Fasting, Jipjf (Pilgrimage) and so forth. Sucb ii vow can be absolute
(Le. unconditional), as in saying, "j have taken a vow to fast (or pr,1y)," or
conditional, as in saying, "lf Alliih cures so and so, 1 vow to perform such
and such an act of worship." lo the fatter case, once the condition 'is fulfl.lled,
R becomes obligatory for the 01:1e taking the vow to fulllli it. 'fhe Prophet
(PBUH) says:

"Wboever vows to obey Alltiih must obey Him."
(Relared hy Al-Bukhari)"
Moreover, Allah, exalted be Hie, says:
"Tl1ey (are those who)Ju1fjill t/1eir (vo111s), .."

(QUr'iln: Ar-Tahrim: 7)
Almighty 1\llah also says:

Judiciary in Islam

Shaykhul-Islam lbn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

"It is obligatory to assume the judiciary as a religious duty and as a means
of drawing r1ear to Allah. In fact, it is one of the best means of achieving
nearness to Allah. However, many persons in this position have been
corrupted because ofseeking leadership and wealth throug/1 it."'
Judiciary is legislated according to the Qur'an, the Sunnah (Prophetic
Tradition) and consensus of Muslim scholars. Allah, Exalted be He, says:

'~nd judge, {O Muhammad], between them by what Allah has
(Qur'an: Al-M:i'idah: 49)
revealed ..:'
And He also says:

"(We said], 0 David, indeed We have made you a successor upon
the earth, so Judge between tlie people ir, trutli ..."
( Qur'an: Sad: 26)

Xlll Q..@i'UVDIOAR,Y)

696

Moreover, the Prophet jPBUH) himself undertook that responslb.ility and
appointed judges in the regions that were under the Islamic rule, nnd so did the
Caliphs that succeeded him. Furthermore, Mus.lirn scholars agree uniformly
on the necessity of assigoingjudges t:o settle dibJJUtes among people.
Jurisprudentially speaking, the judiciary indicates the clarlficatio11 of the
legal ruli11g <lfld applying it as well as settling disputes.
,\s for the judge, Shay!chul-Isl!lm Jbn Taymiyah (may Allah b.ave mercy
on him) said:

•r1re j udge rusumes tlie. role of a, witness with rega,rd to providing
evidence, the role of a mufti' with regard to issuing rulings, and
the role of a person /r1 C111thority with regC1rd to having Judgme,its

implemented." 1
In Islam, tiie judiciary is a colleqive duty ;is it is an indispensable thing
in people's affairs. in this respect, lmlm Ahmad said, "There must be a judge
among penple $0 rhal rights are not lost," Moreover, Shaykhul-fslAm lbn
'Taymiyah said, "The Prophci (PBU H) has made it a duty to appoint one as

ieader when a small group is 011 a journey'. Such a rommand goesJot all kind$
ofassemblies."'
•
lf only one competent person exists who c;an Landertake j,udgeshjp, then
it is aq lndividunl obligarion upon him to do so. That is because undertaking
judgeship involves a great reward for the one \\lho is capable of observing ir
according to the legally prescribed way. Nevertheless. assu(lling judgeship
<involves grave danger for the Ohe who does not appiy ii according to ~he legally
prescribed way.
When appointing judges, the n1ler of Muslims has to appoint fudges
according to the requisites of the public interest so thl!t rights are: not lost
Besides, the ruier has to select the best persons in terms of knowledge nnd
piety. However, if the ruler is not able to decide whether a certain person fits
that position or not, he should inquire about him.
With regard to the judge, he has to make every effort to establish justice
among people. 1bus, the judge i.s not obllgated to .observe what is beyond his
~apaci.t.y or be blamed for it. The person in authority bai. to allocate a suffioient
S11lary from the Muslims' Public Treasury for the judge to cover his expenses
so that he-can dedicate himself exclusively to his job. In support of this view,
the Rightly-guided Caliphs have assigned sufficient salaries from the Muslims'
Public Treasury for judges.

Ch•prer 1: Judiciary in l~l•m

697

The judge's powers are to be referred to the conventions prevailing in cacl\
age separdtely. in this relatio11,Sh1i1ykhul-IslAm Jbn Taymiyah (may Allahfuve
mercy on him) said:
'Jis for the powers ,of tlie ruler. they are not specified by legislation:
rather, they are depettde11t 010 the mstoms .and com•,mtions."'

This is due to the fact r!lat w:hatever is not decided by legislation is to be
referred to G9.nvention, {bn Ta-ym iyah ;1dded:
"The position of the j11dgt rnt1 be divided; namely, it can be held
by many peop11!,for each is a certain area ofjurisdiction. Besides,
°it is not obligatory for the jl./dge to be cognizant of areas other
t-him his. That i$ becquse the position of pmcticing ijtihad can be
divided, Assuming that the-judge is assigned to decide on mt1tters
relilting to the distrlbutiorr of the shares of i11lterita'1ce, It is not
obligatory upon him to be cognizant of matters other than the
rnli11gs pertai11ing to ·t ht Tc.,ws of i11heritance, bequests and such
l'elated matters. Likewise, if t/,e j1J1Jge is assigned to decide orr
matters- relating to marr/a,ge contmcts, it fs not required from
him lo be knowledgeable of other unrelated matters. Hence, it is
permissible to as#gn u judge to decfde on matters ·relating to his
area of knowledge and whatever does not belo11g to that .area is
viewed out of his competen,:e. Tltfs is applicable in the case of the
one who undertakes the pos iticn of the judge to nmder a judgme11t
concerning a certain matter related to ,tile. dlsbeiievers who corifess
satisfqction concerning his bei11g a Judge. lvforeover, if someone,
who is in the state of ·ib.rdm. hu11ts a game jTOm tire /and, then
two just persons ore to be appointed to judge his case. He,icl!, it is
permissible to appoint perso•ns as jiidges to dedde on certain cases
·at specific sifllaUons; yef, t1iey t1re not to be viewed as Judges w/10
.have the compe,e;,ce to decide on all cases." '

Nowadays, the Ministry of .Justice Ila~ adopted a system to which judges
stick; each fudge has his own area of jurisdiction and powers, That is, judges
have io refer IQ that system and. be committed to it, for such a system is.
considered a means of regulating ,matters and 5pecifying jurisdiction. Besides,
that system does not contradict any of the texts of !he Qur'lln or the Sunnalr
·(Prophetic Tradition), so it must t,e acted upon and adhered to,

698

Xlll QADii' (JUDICIARY)

The necessary qualifications (that should be considered
as,much as po~ible) for being an Islamic judge ate:
• 'lb be a legally accountable person, namely lo be adult and sane. That is.
because the non-legally accountable person is under lhe guardianship
ofothers, so sucb a person cannot be the judge of others, for the judge
assumes the poSitic,n of the r.oler.
• To bea male; this is due Jo thelJ,Jditlt in which the Pmphet (PBUH) says:

;The pe(}ple w/t(} are ruled by a woma11 will ne1•er be·su"cs.sful:'
• To be a,ft'eeman; that i~bcc;rnse the slave is busy looking after the rights
of his master.

• To be a Muslim; this is due to the fact th.it Islam is the condition of
being just. Besides, il is required to degrade tbe disbeliever, not to
raise him in rank through appointing hint in such a sublime positi9n
of judgeship,
• To be upright; thnt is becnuse it is impermissible lo appoint the
defiantl'y di~obedi,mt person. This is d·u e to lhe statemeotof Allah,
in which H~ says:
''O yo11 who 110.\le ~•efieved, if t/1ere c~mes to you a dlsobedJent
ohe with itiformiitimi, investigate.. .» (Qur'an: Ai-!Iujurat: 6)

Accordingly, as 11 is not permis~lble to accept Jnfoanation fr-om such a
per;;on, his judgment is to be rejected with •greatec reason.
• To have sound hear1i1)g; thar is because the deafcannot hear tlie spe~ch
of the two litigants..
• Io have s9und eyesight; that Is because the blind judge cannot di~!ingui~h
between the plaintiff and the defendant.
In trus respect, Sha;ykhul-lslnm Ibn Taymiyah s~id:
''According to the 11110/ogic.al deduction of the Ha11bali School, -it is
permis.sible to (lppoint a blind pers,m a.s- a judge just· as his iestimony
is accepted. Tliar is /iecause such a person lades nothing but seefng the
litigani~. a thing wh:iclr he does 1101' need, for he ca,i judge accordil1g /Q
descriptfon. This is supported by 1/1e fact that Pmpl1e/ Dd,vfld (David)

• The judge must have the faculty of speecJi. That is because the dumb
person cannot deliver the judj,'1Tlenrs. Besides, many people do n01
comprehend tne signs used by such a petsotl.
• The judge must be one who exercises ijtil1ad. He must exercise ijtilifld,
eve.n i:n the school he adopts, in which he foUows the opinions of one
of the great scholors. That is, the judge has to be uble to differentiate
between the sound and unsound rulings in that school
With regard to these cond.itions, Shaykhuhlsliim Jbn Taymfyah (muy
Allah have 01ercy on him) said:

"Tlie$e necessary ,7ui1liftcatiuns are lo be considered as much as
possible. Further, t/1e po$i(io,1 ofjudges/tip must be undertaken by
thee best among people. 'fhis is the view adopted by Imtim Ah.mad and
others, Acco1-di11gly, if ther~ are defiamly disobedient persons and one

amongst them is to be c/10sen. l.Jih>ivise, ifthere llrf somepersons who

tl,e niost upright and learned oftliem, with reg,1rd to follm~ing the
opin/Qns of suclt a sc/rool, is to be appointed."
In this connection, the compiler of AI-Furu' (The Brand,es) s,iid, ''The
somuJest opinion is what has been snid by £b11 Taymiyah.'' Besides, the compiler
of. the book entitled AI-In1af(Justice) said with regard to the issue of appoint.tog
the one who imitates the optnio,ts adopted in a particular jurisprudential
scholar, ·: .. Such a view hns been applied for 11 long tfme, so as·not to suspend

Moreover. Imam Jbnul-Qayyim said:

"T/1e cme who exercises ijrihad Is the one wlto possesses knowledge
of /l1e Nol,le Qura11 and the Sunnah In ad1fi1io11, tlte ijiihad ofsucli

Judge Ethics
lmlm Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said, "Good manners means
not to get angry or rancorous." Moreover, Imam lbnul-Qayylm (may Allah have
mercy on him) said:

"The judge needs to know three matters, if any of which is absent,
the judgment becomes invalid: knowing the evidence, reasons, and
clear proofs. For more illustration, the evidence guides the judge to
know the general legal ruling, the reasons guide him to know the
applicability of such a ruling to a certain case, while the clear proofs
guide him to know the way of passing a judgment when there is
contradiction in evidence. Thus, whoever errs in one of the three, errs
in his judgment.
It is recommended that the judge be strong without harshness so that the
oppressor does not belittle him, and flexible without weakness so that the people
entitled to rights may not fear him. In this respect, Shaykhul-Islam Taqiyyud•

XIII (2A1)A' UUDIC'.IARsY)

702

Din Ton Taymiyah (may Allah hove mer,y on him) said, "fudges/tip ii,1s two
1
pillars: strerigth and trnstwortltiness." ln addition, the judge should be patient
soas not to get angry at the words of the litigant11nd thus unable to judge justly.
That i~, patience is the oma·n~ent, beauty and splendo.r of knowledge; and it i~
cohtrary to Impatience, rashness, hastiness, irritability, and instabillty. Besides,
the judge should be patient !m ;is not ro rnisju4ge among litigants. Moreover,
he should be discerning so lthat he could not be deceived by some litigants-.
Furthermore;. the jndge should he virtuous by keeping himself away from all
prohibited matters. Furthe.r, he should be knowledgeable of the Judgments
passed by the preceding judges, The place of the court should be in the middle
of the town, if possible, so lthat people do not face hardship in reaching it.
Besides, there is no harm ins itting in a mosque to declde cases, as it is .reported
that ' Umar lbnul- Kha!!db. ' 'Uthmin Ibn ' Aff/in and 'Ali Ibn Abu l'alib used
to •s it in the mosque to decidt: cases. ln addjtion, the judge should treat the two
litigants impartially and justly in terms of the way he looks at them, the way
he addresses (hem, the placl:s where they sii, the way he receives thi:m, and
so forth. In this regard. Abu Dawud related on the authOJ"ity of lbnuz-Zubayr
(may Allah be pleased with him) who narrated:
'1The Messenger of Al/<,1/1 (PBUH) gfwe t/1e judgment tltat the two
1
m:Jversaries should be made to sit before t/tejudge."

Wi·1h regard ro this, lma.m Jb,nu1-Qayyim said:
"JI ls prohibited for the f1ufge to set one of the two litlgallts above che
other, give Trim more aHc,111011, consult' hfa,, or stand up for /ii,n as 11
means ofhonoring him. Tluit is because such acts may cause the other
litigant to feel dishearteJ'led a,rd 1111able to express his arg1m1ent The
judge also should 1101 show his disapproval of tire licigants, as it may
ca/,se the111 dishcarte11me11t and frustration, and hold their tongues

~
fimm cxpressmg I u:,r ar;g11111e11ls.

In addition to this, it is deemed prohibited for the judge to have a secret
discnurse with one o( the litigants, to teU him what to say, to entertain
him, or to te;ich him how t11 d~li.ver hi~ argument, except when one of the
litiganis forgers something necessary and it must be explained to him wben
presentlng the case.
Besides, the judge's -~~.i;sions ~hould be attended by the jaqihs and he
should consult them coaceming whatever may be difficult or doubtful for
him. Thus, if the ruling is clear to the judge, he is to pa~s hfs judgme-nt; if not,
he 111\J~t delay passing his ju,dgment .until he makes sure of it.

Chaprcr 2, Judgt fal1ie>

703

Tt is deemed prohibited fo1· tbe judge to decide cases wben being in a ~1:ate·
ofgreat anger. This is d'ue to tlie ,IJ_aditl,, in whkh the Prophet (PBUH) said;

''A fudge must not judge t,etwee11 rwo persons while- he is in an
.,
angry mood.
That is because anger affect,s both the judgfs mini! and beai:l a11d thus
blocks his sound comprehension and wise consideration. Likewise, every
matier th,1_t may affect tl1e judge's temperament for the worse, such as lmnger,
thirst. anxiety, boredom, sleepiness, retention of urine or stooL or when the
weather is irritatingly hot or cold., has the same ruling applied lo ahger. Thi, is
ba.~ed on the fact that such mattf:s disturb and confuse tlie mind in a way tbat
may preveMthe judge from reaching a sound decisiO!l,
Further. it l~ prohibited for the judge to receive bribes. This is due to the b.adit/i
narrated by !bn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) in which hesa1d:

"The Messenger (PBVH) tlirsed the one 1\1110 bribes and the 011c
wl,o t,1k~.s bribe.',.
Commenting on this bad/th, At-Tlrmidhi said, "T/Jis is 11 aa.s1111 I"l!l/1 b.adtth:·

ln this regard, bribes are of two,kb1ds:
l • A b1ibe taken from on,e of the two litigants in order to decide ih
his favor.
2- A bribe giv1m to the judge who abstalns from Judging rn favor of
tbe rightful p!?rson 4nt,il he bribes hi,n , This is one of die gtavc~t

The Judge may not decid.e cases in which .ne ls involved or cases involving
11ny of those to whom his l•'$llmony cannot be accepted, such as his father,
son, wife, or enemy. for, in s,~cb cases, he is suspected of partiality. Therefore,
if any of such cases is assigned lo him, be·is to refer it to another judge. This
i6 supported by the fact that - umar Ibnul-Kbatt~b referred the case of Ubayy
lo Zayd Ibo ThabJt to decid,: it, and 'Ali referred an Iraqi man to Shurayh_ to
judge his case, and ' Uthman referred Ialhah to Juba yr lbn Muf im (may Allah
be p!eai;ed wi.th them all) for' judgment.

Lt is desirable for the judge to first iook into the cases demanding ~ummary
decisions, s\Jcb as those ofdfie imprisoned, m1nor orphans,and lunatics, then
the cases of endowments and bequests thot have no guardian.
With regard to tl\edecisions made by the judge, they are not to be invalidated
unless !hey contradlc::l the n t!lings of the Noble Qur'an, theSunnah, or a decisive
consensus of Muslim scbolars. If lhe judge does so, his decisions are not to be
implemented, as they oontra,dicr the Qur'an, Sunnah or the consensus.
ln the light of thisbr!efpresentatlon of the ethics ofthe judge, thejustice of
the judicinry·in Islam becomes evid'enl. In other words, judges in l6lam a~ume
a high rank that cannot be reached through all the worldly law systems. True
are r.he Words of Allah in which He says:
"Tl,en is it the judg,~1e11t of [tl,,e time of] ignorance they desire?
B11t w/10 is better thw1 Allah /11 judg111e111 for a people who are

May .Allah disgrace thos:e who tum away from that divine-judgment and
replace it with Satan's law, Those are the people whom Allah me.ant in the

Method of Un.dertaking Judgment

When two litigants come t<) a judge to decide their case, he seats them
before him and asks, •Who is thie plaintiff?" Or he may wait until the plaintiff
speaks presenting bis claim. The judge then should listen carefully to the claim.
If the claim is presented properljf, the judge then is to ask the defendant, "What
is your defense.?" If the defendamt admits that the claim is true, the judge may
give a decision in favor of the plaintiff, But if the defendant denies the claim,
the judge is to turn again to the plaintiff asking him to present proof ifhe has
any. That is because the plaintiff is the one who should substantiate bis claim
in order to get his right. When the plaintiff brings the proof, the judge is to
pass the judgment according to the proofs.
The judge is not to judge a.ccording to bis own knowledge (apart from
other sources of information) a,s this may lead to his being suspected. In this
regard, the great scholar Ibnul-Qayylm (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

XJIJ QAD,4· (JUDlCIATIY)

''When !he jt«.lge decides a ca$e accordi11g to hu ow11 /inowledge. then
he may decide it unjustly arrd defe11d himself$aying t.hal he has done

He also said:

"It is authentically repotted that Abu BaJ..-r. •lfmar. "Abdur• Rahmati
lbn 'Awf and Mu 'awiyah viewed such an act prohibited and ncne of
the Prophet's Companions was known to disagree with them. Be.1ides,
the master ofJudges, the Prophet (PBUH), knew some matters a&oulflie
hypocrites·that would make it law/11/ to kill them and take their wealth.
However, he did not deeide t/ieir case in terms of his ow,n knowledge,
though ihere would be no offense 011 him ifhe did so.for he Is fretfro!II

lbnlli,Qayyim added:
~ .. However, it is permlssi'ble forrhe judge to decide the cases a.c((lrding

to what is available before him of recurrently reported inj()rmation,
namely, there are many who share knowledge with him. Moreover, it is
pennissibleJot-the judge to decide a case nctording to the information
tlmt many people other t/1an hii11 have k11owledge of T1111s, it is
permissiblefor him to depend on sud, rec1lrrent information in passii1g
judgments as they are considered among •the most prepo11derant

With regard to the plaintiff; If he says, "I (lave no proof to substantiate
my claim;" then the judge is to· inform him that be. inay request that tbe
defendant swear. This is according to,the b.adith related byMuslim and AbO
Da.wud that states:

"Two persons referred their case to 'the Prophet (PBUH); one ofthem
wru from Hadramaut and the other Was from Ki11dah. The one who
had come from Hadmmaut said., 'O Messenger of Allah! This man
hns apprapriated my land which belo11ged to my father. The one
who had co111e from Kindall said, 'This is my land and it is in my
possession; he has 110 right in it.' The Messenger ofAllah .(PBUH)
said to the man from H,adramaut; "1Jo you .have any evidence (fn
support your claim)?' Me replied in the negative. Thereupon, the
Messenger ofA'/lah (PBUR) said, 'Then, your case is to be decided

In this respect, JmAm Ibnull-Qayyim said;
"This is th~continuous rule of the Shari 'ah ,(Islamic Law). He,ue, the
oath is to be taken by the ,de/endm1t, as the plaintiff lias not brought
forth rmylliing supporting his claim. Thereupon, the defendant Is rhe
one who is to take the O<lth, llS there is 110 proof against him and he
is primarily innocent. Ill oither wor(is, the defendant is Cite stronger of
the two lihgants due to the orig.inalprincip/e ofbeing innocent; thus,
.the oath is to be taken. liy liim~'

Therefore, i.f !lie plaintiff (·equests that the defendant take an oath, the
judge is to make him do so ruid then set 'him free, as the principle states his
lnnocem:e, Nevertheless, it is stipulated, for the validity of the defendilnL's oath,
that !he o'ath is to be a reply to what the plaintiff claims. Moreover, the oath i~
to be taken l'>y, the defendant after the plaintiff's request, as it is a tight of the
plafoliff which must not be tal<•in except after his requesr.
However, if the defendant abstains and refuses to ~ear, then he is ju<JBed
as being guilty, under the condlitf()ns of his abstention from taking the oath.
That is because i.f the plaintiff's,cJaim was untrue, the defendant would defend
himself by taking the oath. So, his refusal to take an oath is considefed an
evident proof indicatini the truthfulness of the plaintiff in whatever he claims.
Thus, J;uch a proof is to be comsidered regardless of the principle stating the
innocence of the defendant u11til proven guilty; Considering the defendant
guilty ill case he refuses to takean 0<1th is the opinion adopted by many scho!af!i,
and ' UthmAn (lll3y Allah be pleased with him) passed judgments according to
it. In this regard, some scholars,say, "Tf the defot1dnnrrefuses to swear, then the
j udge is to ask the plaintiff to sw,~ar, esp.uially ifhis claim is substantiated."
With regard to the issue of taking !In oath, Imibn fbnul Qayyirn (may

"The Sharf 'ah ordains that the oath is to be taken by the one whose

Valid Court Claim: Conditions

The claim is not valid unless it is presented in detail. So, if the claim is about
a debt owed from a dead person, for example, then the death of the indebted, the
type of the debt and its amount a~ well as aU the other related information that
may clarify the claim must be mentioned. This is due to the fact that the decision
is dependent on such details. That is why Allah's Messenger (PBUH) said:

•... I give my judgment according to wl1at I hear."'
Hereby, the hadith refers to the obligation of clarifying the claim so as to
clarify to the judge the reasons and facts needed for the decision.
It is not valid also to litigate over something unknown or unspecified; the
object of claim should be known so as to be attained and obligated when the
validity of the claim is proven. However, there are some exceptions to this ruling,
a~ it is valid to do so in some cases, such as claiming a bequest in which a person
bequeaths some of his wealth or one of his slaves as a dowry or suchlike. In

14

x:m QAM'OUDJClARY)

such a case, the claim is valid, even if 1he thing litigated over is urlknown Or
unspecified.
Moreover, the claim must be declared. So, It is not enough for the plaintiff
to say; "He owes me such and such:' but he (the plaintiff) must declare that he
claims such a thing. Besides, the thing lltlgated over must be ,;lue, as fhe claim is
not valid for a debt on credit This is because the defendant is not to be demanded
for the debt before its due Umeand, also, he is not to be imprisoned for it.
Furchermore. the claim nrustnot involve what disproves it For example, it is
invalid to daim that -~omeone killed somebody,or stole something twenty years
ago while the defendant's age is less than twenty; as the claim would be illogical.
If it is litigated over a selling or renting contract, the claim, 1n order tQ be
valid, must involve the conditions of the contract. This is due to the fact thaf
some people may dispute over them . Besides, that contract may be invalid from
.the Judges point of view.
1n addition, if the claim relates to inheritauce, the reasort erttil'ling it must be
darifieo. That is because the reasons obligating foherilance diffet, so the reason
on which the claim is es1ablished must be defined.
Further, the valid claim must define the object litigated over; whe\ker it is
present in the court or the coµntry, so as to eliminate obscurity. However, if
the cl.aimed object is .n ot present, then ii must be described with a description
like thai connected wilh bl-l}'lng;_ namely, to st~te all t he neressaFy descriptions
of the object.
In additiQn to this, fusllce (trut'hftili1ess) Is considered a prerequisite for
the validity of the evidence. This is due to i he noble verse in whic!i Allah,
£xalted be !:le, says:
''. .. A11d bring to wlt11tss rwo jrutmen from o.mrm.g yo11 •••u,
(Qur'an: A1-Ial~q: 2)
Allah also tays:
"...from tl10~ wliam you accept as witnesses..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 282)
And:
"O you who hffve belle,,ed, if there comes to y ou a disobedient
one with informo.tiort, investigate..." (Qnc'an: Al-Hujurat:.6)
In this regard,faqihs (may Allah liave mercy on them) ,diffcr as to Whether
the witness must be an outwardly and i11w11Tdly just (l:rue) person or being np
outward just person is enough, There are two different opinions. the prepon-

Chaptor·4, Valid Coun Cl:um,.Coi1tlltions

715

derant of which 1feeJ11S an outwardly Just person a valid witness. This is bllSed
on the fact that the Prophet t PBUH) accepted the tes11mony of 11.Bedoui11•{1.e.,
the Prophet (PBUH) considered his outward ~late). Besides, • Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, "Muslims are just."'
ln I.his respect, the judge,is to judge depending on the just evidence unless
he knows otherwise. That is, ifhe knows thatsuch evidence is co11lr,1dicted (by
others), I.hen it 1s not permissible for him ro decide according to it.
As for lhe witnesses Whose justice (i.e., truthfulness) is not known to the

judge,h!!IS to inqµireabout th@m. He may ask. persons who are well acquainted
"~th those witnesses-such al> friends, neighbors or persons dealing with them
financially: In this regard, ' tJmar (may Allah be pleased with him} said to a
man who recommended an(llher man before him:

'½re you a neighbor ofhis?~ The ma,i replied ir1 the neggtive, Then,
' Um11r- asked him agai,i, "Have you ever accompatiied him in
tmveli,ig where ll1e true nature of men appears)?" The man said,
~No,'' •Umar a$ked l1in1 for tl,e third time, "Have you ever dealt
With him financ{al/y?" The man replied i11 the ,iegative. Upon this,
'Umar said, "Then. you do 110Uirrow him."'

lf there is contradiction berween the proofs invalidating and those validating the .witnesses, namely, there are signs indkafing their non-uprightness
for testimony as well as others indicatmg their uprightness, the judge must
give precedence to the issue of their non-upri,ght.ness (i,e., not to accept their
testimony). This is supported by the fact that .the one refuting the uprightness of a witness knows something unperceived by the one who recommends
him. Besides, such a -person teUs about something w1known by others while
the one viewing the uprightness of the ·witness for testimony tells only about
something outward. Moreover, the one refuting fhe uprightness of a witness is
proving something (to substantiate his view) while the one who views othel"wise tries to deny something already proved. lt is.stated as a general principle
that whit i.s proved is to be .given precedence to what is denied. [n this connedion, when the defendant ncknowledgcs the jus!icl! 1111d ~tuthfulness of tl,e
evidence, it is considered just and true accordingly. That is because seeking
the truthfuiness of the evidence is a means of ensuring his right. Moreovei;
his acknowledgement of the truthfulness of the evidence is regarded as ,u,
acknowledgment of'Lhe right he,owes to the other litigant (the plaintiff). So,
the defendant ts ·io be judged in consideration of his ncknowledgtnent of the
trutlifuhiess of the evidence.

xm Q,WA'UUDlCIARY)

716

As for tlie judge, i, ( he k11ows r-he ttuthfuiness of the evidence;. the11 he
mu.st decide the case according to it and he <loes- not need recommenilatfon.
Otherwise, lf the j.udge knows the untruthfulness of tile evidence, he must
:not jud,ge according 10 it. Moreover, if he has some doubt with regard to the
witnesses, he must ask them how they bore such a witness and where they bore
it. Ibnul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said~
''." The judge must Jo. this (i.e. , to t.1'.clude do11bted evidence and
J!tdge,according to the proven ones), Thus, ifhe deviatesfrom doing

this, then-he is regarded as committing a sin and t11rni11g away from
the. right judgment. 111 thu regard, it happened that two witnesses
testified before 'Ali lbn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him)
that·a man had stolen something, but 'Alf doubted their testimony.
Therefore, fie ordered·tliem to wt off· the mQtis hapd themselves (to
test their truthfulness), so rliey Jted.'''

If a litigant claims tlie invalidation of a-wiu,ess, he musr introduce proof.
This is due to the b.adith in which the Prophet' (PBUl-t} said:

"Proof lies 011 the plainl!fJ-:''
In such a case. such a litigant is to be granted a respite of three days to
present his proofs, but if he brings noM, then he is judged in consideration
with the evidence. That Is- because his inability to bring a proof that the
•witnesses are not upright duriJ\ll the specified peri.o d is eonsidered a proof of
the voidance of what )1e claims.
If the judge does oot know the actual stale of the Witnesses, he i8 to ask
the plaintiff to prove their· uprightness, so as to judge.according to what they
testify. lo order to accept the uprightness of the witness, there should be two
persons testifying before the judge that he is: just and truthful. However, it is
viewed sufficient by some scholars that one person testifies lhat the witness
is upright
It is permissible to judge an absent person provided that11e is far., off for a
distan€e that requires shortening prayers as long as the claim is proved against
hun. This is due to the b.adit/1 in which Htnd Birtt •Utbah complained co the
Prophet (PBUH) saying:
"O Messenger of Allah! Abu Su.f;•an (her h11sba11d) is a stingy mah
and he ·does not give me whar suffices my children and me." The
Messenge, said to /1e1; '"T11ke 1vhat is sufficient for you and your

l:lereby, the l!adith il\dicate1; the permissibility of judging against the
absent person. Nevert11eless. whmt tl\e absent person returns. be may vresent
his argument before the judge as the reason obstructing the case ls eUmillllted
by bis return. That is because proving the truthfulness of something ,does not
invalidate tbe claim against it or lleglect it.
When deciding against an abi:ent person, he f)'IUSI be.out of the area falling
under the authority of the judge. However, if the absent person is in that area
?lld there is no judge therein, the _iud.ge ls tQ write to a person fitting to decide
among the htigants to judge betweeu them.. However, if it is unattainable to do
so, then the judge is to write to •whoever is fit to effect conciliation between
the litigants. But, if it is unattainable to do so, then the judge is to ask the
plaintiff w bring a proof ~ub5ta11tloting. his claim. Therefore, if the plaintiff
s.ubstanfiated liis claim with proo:fs, then the judge is co bringihe other lit-igant
even ifhe is far-off.
lo relalfon to this, Imam Ahmad mentioned that the opiniGm adopted by the

scholars ofMedina stated that the;1 decided cases againsrthe absent persons. He
commented on this saying th.at this is a good opinion. Moreover, Az.Zarkasht
said, "fm4m Ahmad did not deny the view qf heari11g the claim or the evidence
(fr, order !o de/ride against 411 abstint person)." Besides, Imam Ahmad cited the
opinion of the people of Medina and Iraq as if ii was uncontrovetsial.
In. addit Ion·to this, it is per'missible to listen to the claim against son1¢one
who is not legally accountable and then decide according to 11\e proofs. This is
~upported by the aforementioned l!adi/11 of Hind Bint 'Utbnh. If such a petsoa
becomes legally accountable after passlng a judgment against him; then.he has

Dividing Sha1res among Partners
The proofs of dividing shares among partners are derived from the Noble
Qur'an, the Sunnah (Prophetic Tradition) and the consensus of Muslim scholars. Allah, Exalted be He, says:
'½nd inform them that tl'te water Is shared between them ..."

(Qur'an: AJ-Qamar: 28)
He also says:
'½nd when [other/ relatives m,d orphans and the needy are
present at the [time of] d'ivisio11 ..."
(Qur'an: An- Nisa': 8)
Moreover, the Prophet (PBUIH) says:

"The preemption is applied in every joint undivided property."'
Moreover, he (PBUH) hims,elf used to divide the spoils of war an1ong
Muslims '. In addition, many scholars maintain that there is consensus among
scholars on the issue of division. This is due to the fact that necessity calls for
it as there is no other way to give: rights of the joint property to those entitled
to them except through division.

Consensual Division and Compuisory Division
First Type~ Consensual Division
ll refers to lhe division 1hat 1nus1 be implemented with th;: mutual
consent of all partners and it is 'impermissible lo implement it without their
plllluol consent. For more illustration, it is the kind of division thar cannot be
implemented without causing harm to one or some of the partners, or that
cannot be implemMted except when one of the partners _gives something in
compensation to the other, Such 11 type may be witnessed in properties such
as &mali homes, shops o, lands consisting of different spots distinguished by
buildings, trees or the like, or whei1 a certain spot represents a kind ofbenefil
for one of the partners•excluding the others. Therefore, it is impermissible to
divide such a type of joint properties except with the mutual consent of nil the
partners. This is du;: to the b.adith in which the Prophe1 (PBUH) says:

"One should not harm others norsho11ld Oll('Seek benefitfor himself
by causing harm to others,"
(Related by Imam Ahmad and other compilers 6( Hadith)
'The general meaning of the /lndith indicates that it is impermissible to
dioide something that may cause harm to any of the partners except with thepartners' mutual consent. Such a dh~sion takes the same ruling applying to
sale transactions. That is, the sold item may be returned if defective, Besides, it
involves the option to concl.ude the contact or cancel it in the session of selling,
making conditions, and suchlike matters. Nevertheless, no partner is to be
focced to accept sucl1 a division. But if one of the partners demands selling the
joint item, the one who refuses division is to be obliged to submit, and if he
in~i~ts on his stand, then the judge m:1y se1) the item on their behalf and divide
the price between them, each according to his share.
The sort of harm that forbfds implementing such a type of division is
the undervaluation of the property when dh~ded, regardless of whether the
partners benefit from the division or not. That is, it is not included in s11ch
harm that the partners do not benefit from the joint property if divided.

Second Type; Compulsory Division
This is when there ls no harm caused in dividing a property, and there is
no compensation required. rt is call~d so because the judge forces the one who
refuses division to accept and lmp1ement it when its conditions a.re fulfilled.

Ch•pccr 5: Dividing Sham among Parmtl1'

721

Such,a typ~ of divislol'l'n,ay be conduded in properties such as a village, a garden, big houses and shops, spacious lands, as well as measurable and weighable
items from the same kind.
In order to make it permissible to oblige the one abstaining from division
lo accept it, threa conditions must be fulfilled;
l • The judge must make sure of the partners' ownership of the article.

2· He must make sure that there will be no harm resulting from~ divjsion.

). He must make sure of the possibility of dividing the shares oftheioint
property in a way allowing the shares to be changed Without giving
compensation to any of the partners in return for this change.
Thus, if one of the partners demands divis'fon, after fulfilling these condi·
tions, the other partner is to be forced to implement it even If he refuses to do
.so. This is based oo the fact that division eliminates thir harrn caused by the
exlsteoce of pru-tnership, and enables each partne.r to dispose freely of his own
share and benefit from 11 through plaming, building and suchlike malter6 !hat
are not attainable with the erdstence of paflnership.
With regard to the above issµe, if one of the parl-ners is not legall y
accountable, then his guardian may implement the division on his
bel1alf. Moreover, if one of the partners.ls absent (foy any reason). t hen
the judge may implement the division on his behalf upon rhe demand
of th~ other partner.
In tact, that type of division ls a means of ili&tinguishing the share of one
partner from that of the other. Moreove,·, it does not take the same r11Jing
,ipplied lo sale transactions, as e;ich has its own specified rulings.
It is permissible for the partners to divide the joint properfy by themselves,
.i::s.jgnsomeone to divide it among them, or refer lo the judge to assign-some•
one to do so.

As for adjusting the div,isioJl of the shares. it may be through divitling
tlte joi.n t pioperty into part,;, if the property is weighahle or measurable

~nd of the same kind. Moreover, just divisiort of shares may be thr11ugh
considering the value otthe shares in case the p roperty is of different parts;
eacl\ 'having a value different from that of the others. In such a case, the
share consisting ofparts ofless value must be more than theshare consi~1ing
of parts of higher value, so as to make a ki11d of 15alance between them.
However, ifimplementing a just division is not attainable. neither through

722

XIII QAL/;f' UUDICIAAY)

dividing the properly nor considering the value, then partners m~y resort
to compensation, n.ame1y, the one who takes a share of value more t.hnn t he
share of lh! other partner has HJ pay him an amQunl of money equal to the
difference in value.
WIien the partners divide the property amoog themselves or draw lots
for the shares, the. division becomes 'binding. That ls because the one who
divides the property among them is Uke the judge and the act of dra,ving lots
on lhe shares is like the decision made by thej1:1dg_e, so the.division becomes
binding. II is permissible to draw tors on the shares in any form. However,
the most prefe.rable way of d,:awing lots is the one ln wluch the ,tames of
the partners are written on pieces of paper itnd the11 they are rolled up and
mixed together. Then, the partners may invite a person, who was not present
(so he did not see such pieces of paper) and ask him to pick iliose pieces and
put them on the· shares. SI), whoever finds his name on a certain share, it
belongs to him.
Besides, if each partner gives the other the right to choose between shares,
tbe division becomes binding, by means of their consentaod by the ending of
the session of division without any objection.
Moreover, if one partner claim~ that there is~ mista)<e in the·division they
have implemented among themselves, though there are witnesses on their
m,m1al i:onsent, then such -a claim is not con.sidered. This is due to the fart
that he J,as already consen1ed to the divis-ion nccording to the way it has been
Implemented, so he is lo ac.ept the increase of the share of the or her partner.
[n addition, whoever claims that the,re is a mistake in the . division

implemented by the person assigned by the judge or the person they have
assigned, such a claim is considered o.nJy with a proof; otherwise, !he other
partner is to take an oath denying that d:iim. The original ruling states rhar
the claim is not true Uni ii proven otherwise. Thus, if Such a person presents
proof .substantiating his claim, then it is considered and the diyision is 10 be
Invalidated. This ls based on the fact that his silence(i.e.,accepting theaJvlsion)
goes bac" lo hls view conGemingthe apparent just[ce of the person who has
implemented the division, So, if th.e person submits a proof sub~tantiating his
claim of the injustice made to his right, he may claim hfs right back,
Whereas, ireach of tbeJtwo -partners daims his rlght ttJ ·something in the
property, they may resort 10 taking oaths and the division is to be invalidated.
That is.because the thing they both daim hai; not gone to-someone other than
them, and none of them has a prpofto outweigh the dalm of the other.

Claim aLnd Evidence
The term "claim" refers 10 thE, act of requesting or demanding something.
Allah, Exalted be He, says:

"... and for them is whatever they r1141uest [or wish]."
(Qur'an: Yasin: 57)
Jurisprudentially, the term "daim" refers to the act when a person demands
something in the possession of another person or in his liability. As for the
"evidence," it refers to any sign indicating one's right, such as witnesses and
oaths. Imlm Ibnul-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:

"In the Sharl ·ah, clear evidence refers to whatever clarifies and
manifests any right. Allah, .Exalted and Glorified be He, has made
rights clear with signs and indications signifying and leading to them.
So, whoever ignores those s(gns and indications in general wastes a
lot of rulings as well as rights.'''

Xllf QAl;1A' OUDICIARY)

The difference between, the plaintiff and -the defendant is that the former i6
the one who is'l'eleased when silent (does not claim) wnile tile latteds the one
who is not rdeased when silent, as he ls claimed against.
In order to deioide oo the v~l idi·~ nf the claim or the denial (defense), e~ch
must be from a persoti who has the freedom of action i.etl he must be a free,
major, and legally accountitble person.
lf t;wo persons claim for a pnrticuJar property that is already in the
possession of one of the l1itigants, then if belongs to the person who has it,
provided that he swears an oath that it is bis. In this regard, the litigant who
is in full possession of rhe property is called the • ingoing" while the one who
does- nor possess ii is called rhe ;<outgoing."
However, if each of the two litigants submits proof that the property is his,
the property is to be given to the "outgoing party (i.e., the one who does not
possess it):' Thls is based on the h<UitJlt narrated by [bn ' Abbas (may Allah be
pleased with him), a~ a mu~fil' /111dit'/i. fn this badith. the Prophet (PBUH) said:

''if people were to be ,given what tliey claim (without proving their
claim), then some people w/Jtl/d ciqirn t/ie life am/ property ofotlter

people. The oath is 1c, be 111ke11 b)• thedefe11d<mt (in tf,e absence of
any proof agalmt him/."
(Related by lmam Ahmad and lmam Nluslim/
Moreover, the Prophet (PB Ui-1) .said:

"Proof lies 011 the plain tiffand 1/,e oath is lo be sworn by the defendant:'
(llelated by At-Tirmidhi)'
Thus, rhe rwo uadith$ indicate that the plainliff is the one who must
bring proof substnntiatfng his clafm; if he brings it, the decision will be in
hls favor. They also indiatte that the onth is to be taken by the person who
denies the claim (the defondant) when the plaintiff does not have proofs
substantiating his claim. J!n this case, the majority of scholars say t hat the
property b elongs to the ,one who al ready is in full possession of it; the
"ingoing party." Those scholars are of the vlcw that the b.ad-Ttlt concerns
the case in whlc.b the oa,! who is in possession of the property does not
have a proo(; thus, bis possession of th.is property next to the proof will
be stronger. Tr is worth ment l,111ing that the oplnion of lhe majodty of
scholars has more ,r ight to be followed.

727

However, when the property ,i~ ill the possession of neither, then eac.h 1s to
swear an oath that it do.e-s :not belong to the other, and half the property is to
be equally divided between them. This 'is because they are egunl in their claims
and none of them has proofs to outweigl1 those of the other. However. if there
is an apparent sign rndicating that the property belongs to one of them, it is
10 be oonsideted in tl\e decision. For example, if two spouses litigate over the
clothes and suchlike of the house belongings, then whatever fits a man is to be
given to 1he husband and whatey,~r fits a woman is to be. given to the wife, and
whatever fits both is to be given to both.

Te:stimony

Testimony, in Arabic, refers to seeing, since the witness informs about
what he/she has already seen and known. It is a controversial matter among
scholars whether the witness should begin hls/ her testimony with saying, "I
testify..." or "I have testified ...• o,r not. In this regard, there are two views; the
first is the well-known view maintained by the Hanball scholars, namely, that
it is obligatory to say such wordls when testifying. The second is one of the
views reported to be maintained by Imam Ahmad and a group of scholars;
they maintain that it is not obligatory to begin one's testimony with "I testify...•
or the like. This is the same opinion adopted by Imam Taqiyyud-Dln lbn
Taymiyah, his disciple lbnul-Qay-yim, and other Muslim scholars.

Shaykhul-Is!Am Ibn Taymiyaih said:
"It is not a prerequisite of testimony to say 'I testify.. : This is the same
opinion adopted by Imam Ahmad and others, and ir has not come to my
knowledge that there is a contl'ary legal text in this concern. Furthermore,

lbnul-Qayyim says,

'ikcording to the smm d view of the majorlly of Mui/1111 scholars in this
regard, informing alJcmt what v11e /ill$ wit11essed is In fact a testiino11y.
'l'lwt is lo SQ)\ it is mu ,1 wnditio11 for the validity of tl1e testimony

s11c11 and sudt a thing or that he has hetird suc/1 a11d such a tliiJtg and
the like, this is regarded as a valid testimony. In addition, there is 110
text either in the Gloi-iaus Quri'm or i11 the Surmalt stipulating ./hat
the witness is to say 1 te;1i}y' when bmring a testimony. Furthermore,
none of the Companicms of the Prophet (PBUH) is reported to hav~
,tlip1.1lated st1yilzg so when testlfyihg, nor can ii be co11cl11ded by means
ef r.m11/ogical deduction or i>ifere11ce. Furl/re,; the mm1erot1s proofs of
the Glorious Quran, the S,mnah, the sintements of tlw Companions
and the Arabic langua,g? assert that' it is 110/ required to say such words
0
when Jestifying."
ft is u collective duty to w1de1take iestimony in matters other than the
limits set by Allah, Exalted be JJ!e. That is fo say., if someone assumes the
responsibility of testifying, it hcctlme~ suffidentand lbe test of the Muslims are
not to be accountable, sinc,e the purpose of testimony has been accomplished.
If there is only one person to do so, then it is persona!Jy obligatory upon him,
in considerntion with what Allah,.Exnlted be He, says:

"... A11,l /er 11ot the witnesses tef11sc whe11 tfiey are·called·upon..."

(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 282)
Thal ls, if witnesseSc are· asked to assume the respo11sibility of testifying to
what Lhey have witnessed, they are to offer the testimony. The general meaning
of the verse implies both assuming the responsibility of testif)'ing and offering
th~ testhnooy itsel( Accordi1:tg to lbn •Abb~ and others, the above.-mentloned
verse means.assuming the responsibility of testifying a nd dedaring restitnony
in front ofa judge (or a court, a deliberative body, or those in authority). Since
necessity requires legal tesr:tmony for confirming the rights of people and the
concluded contracts., testifying becomes an obligation like enjoini,,g what is
right and forbidding wh.it iis wrong .
.As for declaring te~timouiy, ii is an individual ,lur.y on whomever undertakes
it, and is asked to testlfy, in consider~tion of wbat A'lloh1 Exalted be.He, says:

Chapier 7: Tesdmony

";, ,And do not co11ceat testimony, for wlloever conceal$ it - his
hMrt is Indeed sinful..."'
(Qur'an; Al-B<1qarah: 283)
'I'hat is, when one is asked Lu testify of what one has witnessed, one is
not \o conceal testimony nor overstate in declaring it, since Allah says, "..for
whoever conuals It - his heart u indeed sinft1T.. ," That is to say, the heart
of the one con€eaHng testimony is wicked; a severe divine threat of turning
one's heart into a wicked disfigured one. Allah mentions the heart in partioular
since it is the position acquainted with what one !ias. witnessed. The above
verse signifies that testifylhg is an individual duty upon whoever witnesses an
event whenever heishe is asked to testify.
The great scholar Ibnul-Qa)'yim (may Allah ltave mercy on him) says..
''Undertnkir,g and declarlng·testl'1ncmy are ,m obligatf<m the nonperformance of
which is a sin.'' He adds:
''. .. By means of analogical deduc,icm of the ilir.w maintained bi t/te
Hanbali scholars in this c011cem, if the witness conceals his te.stimony
(i.e., refuses to u11dertake or declare testimony) concerniitgany right,
he is to redre.ss tltis right in the form of a fine. This is became Ire /tas

lf there is 11.0 harm on th e side of the witness (because of declaring
testimony), it then becomes ,,bligatory upon him to testify. ttowevef) lf
testin1ony will cause haun to him personally or ro his sense of honor, property
or famtly, in tltia case, 11 js not oblig.itory tipon hi,n; This is according to what
Allan, Exalted be He, says:
~... Let 1u1 stfi/,e ·1,e harr.ned or any wilue&$..."

(Qur'an: AJ-Baqarah: 282)
This also is demonstrated in •the b.adith in which the Prophet (PBUH) says!

'"One shouitl iwt harrn others nor should Ile seek benefilfor himself
by causing harm t() ot/;ers."

And Allah, Exalted be He, knows,best.
The witness must be ,certain about the matter roncerning which he is to
testify. it is prohibited for the W'itness ro restify to having witnessed anJ'thing
except what he/she knows with certainry (by s¢eing or headng for example),
·;,1 cons.ideration to what Allah, 'Exaltetl be tie, says:

XILI QADA' UUDIUARY)

'132

"A,,d do 11ot p11rs11e that ofwhich ypi, have ,w l.11owledge,. ,"
(Qur'an:A,l-ls;a': 36)
And His statement:
"... but only those w/10 testify to tht truth [can betlt.flt), at1d
they Jmow."
(Qor'an: Az-Zukhruf: 36)
Tftat ,is, the witness must be wholly certain regarding what he/she is to testify.
In this connection-; lbp_ ' Abbas {may Allah be pleased with ·him) llarrated:

"When the Prophet (PBUH) 1110s asked about testimony. he said
to the i,iquirer, 'Do you see tl1e stm?' The man replied in the
affirmative. He (PBUH) then said, 'So testify like tltis or leave it
(i.e., be wholly certain regarding what )'011 are testifying the same
as you are certain ofseeing the sun, or do not t't!stify): "
This narration is related by Al- Khlllhtl i'rt his book entitled ;\/-Jami ' (The
Col/ectionl Al-Bayhaqhays, "Th1s narrotion is 1101 narrated bya reliable chain
oftranm,itters.~However, Al-Hif!Z Ibn Hajar .says commenting on this lladith,

''. .. But the meaning of the lladfth staled ill this 11<11,a/io11 is correct."
To illustrate, knowledge about the matter, regarding which one is to ,testify,
should be based either upon hearing it or upon seeing it. Thereby, ope is not
to testify, to having witnessed anything except what one knows with certninty
by way of seeing or l\earing, or through hearing about an issue which is a
public event discussed among people a nd which is difficult to know except
ill lh!s wa9, as in cases like relationships by marri.age and death (of a person),
However, one is not to offer testimony depending upon hearing about an issue
discussed among people except when it comes to on& knowledge through u
number of people enough to prove the certainty of such rnarter.

There are six conditions to be fulfilled
by the one who is to deliver testimony:
I• Reaching puberty: Testimony is not acceptable from children except
when it concerns matters.relating to them. In this concern, the great
scholar lbnul-Qayyl111 says:

"The Compariions of the Prophet .(PBU Ii) and the Jaq/hs of Medina
t1scd to accept the l1?$timony of chlldte,i wlien 1t is related to quarrels
occurring amongst tliem. Tliis rs because men are not typically present
m silch situations. If tltt! lestimo11y of those childre11 were 1101 to be

Chapt~r 7, Tcstimorur

733

·acceptable In such Jltuatiom, people~ rights would be lost. unfuljnted
and thus disregarded, especially when their testimo11y is more probable
to be truthful or reliabl)' truthful. This is as in cases such as when they
come directly, without going to.their homes, to testify to art inciilellt fh€)'
have witnessed, agree on tlte same iflformation and are separated at
the time of delivering the testimony. Whe11 their testimony is identical
In such a case, their teslimnrt)' is t,011sidered more reliable than 1'1al of
twa men. This is a vi~~ that cannot be ilBnied or refµsed·..."'
2- Satilty: The test.imony of the insane or the foolish person i~ not

acceptable. As for the one who sometimes loses consciousness, his
testimony is acceptable when he r~gains consciousness and assumes
the responsibility of testifying. Thi& 1s because in his consciousness,
it is a testimony fr.om a sane person who resembles a p erson who ,has
not lost his mind.
3- The Ability to Speak: The testimony of the mute Is not acceptable
even if his signs and gestures are understandable, since certainty must

be folfilled fo testimony; The signs of the mute, in spite of th"t, are
effective <lltd s11fficient. in rulings pertaif!ing to his affairs such as
marr iage and divorce, for necessity. However, if such a person writes
his testimony, it is then acceptable, for wrjtini ls suggestive of speech
(i.e., what he cannot say can be written).
4- Being a Muslim: A witness must be a Muslim according lo the vene in

which Allah, Exalted be, He, says:
•~ ..And bring to witness two just nie,1 from among you..."

(Qur'an: AI-Ialaq, 2)
Thus, the testimony of a disbeliever is unacceptable except when being
·a witness to a will at the·time of bequest when one is traveling and is
about to die. Only in this case the restimony of two disbelievers are
acceptable when there are no Muslims, in consideration to what Allah,
Exalted be He, says:

''O you w11o have believed, testimony (should be take,,] amo11g
you when /hath approaches. one of you at the time of bequest
~ [that of] two just men from among you or two others from .

outside ifyou are trave(ittg through the lan4 and the disaster of
Jeatlashou/d ,1trlke you..."
(Qur'an: AI-MA'idah: l 06)

XIII QADA'(JUDJCLARY)

73!1

The testfmoay of two disbelievers is legalized for necessity only in
,this case.
5- Having II Good Memory: The testimony, of a foolish ·or Ii forgetful
person is not acceptable, since it is known that such a person makes
many mistakes mid usually forgtts, il!ld becau_~e he is unreliable in
telling the truth. Besides, whatever he says is thought to be incorrect
since it 1nay be one of his misrakes. Yet, testimony is accept;ible from
the person who makes fewer mistakes and does not usually forger,

since none is free from both deferts,
6-Uprightness: Ju.risprudeillially speaking, the term ''uprightness~ refers
to one's righteousbes,s and moderateness whatever one says or does.
What proves that uprigMness is one of the conditions of testimony-is
what Allah, Exalted be He. s~ys in the Glorious Qur'an:
". ..from those whom you accept as w/I'1JeS5es.••"

(Qur'an: AI- Bnqarah: 282)
And:
"... And bring to wit lleS5,lwo J14st me11 fro11, among yo11 •• .''

{Qur'An: AEfal~q: 2)
The majority llf Mu·slim scholars maintail'l that uprightness is no
additional characteristic to being a Muslim, A just and upright Muslim
1s the one who abides by the reli.gious obligations and acts of worship,
observes rhe desirable dee&, and keeps ;iway from committing the
prohibited and the detestable ones. In tliisregard, Shaykhul-Islam Ibn
Taymiyah {may Allah have mercy on him) says, "The faqihs 11nifor111/y
agree that Ure /esti111011y of the ,me known to be zmtrut/iful is rejected,"•
Ibn Taymiyllh also adds:

": .. The concept of 11prightness is ydluetl according lo each age, p{tice
a11d people. Thus, a witness must be 11n upright person according /o his
,own people, though 1/w uprightness of the same person may be viewed
,difJ"ere11tly by other people (though still considered uprightness), 'I'f,js /$

Companinm, then all tire test(ino11ie5 o, most of them woilld be invalid."'

Chapter 7: Testimony

735

Ibn Taymlyah goes tin \Si1yi11g:

''. .. II is advi5able to accept the testimony of ihose known to,be ourwardly
twrf,fa.J in cases of 11ecru:sity eve11 if /hey do not observe the //miu set
by Al/11/t. Thus, their resl1mo11y may be accepted it1 cases telaleil to
impr,isonmeni, incidents among Bedouins or in village.$ where there are
no i,pright witnesses,"•
faqflis (may Allah have n:1ercy on them)malntafn that one's uprightness
is known by two thrngs, the first of which is performing the rel1gio1-1s
obligations: the Five Oblig3tory Prayer6 anu Al-fumu 'ah (Friday}
Prnyer along with thelr stre-sed supererogatory practices. Thereupon,
the testimony of the on,e regulady neglecting these prayers and the
Witr Prayer• is unacceptable, Cnncernlng the one who persists in
abandoning the supererogatory acts of prayer, lm!m Ahmad {may
Allah have mercy•on him) says, ".,.Sucli a person fa a wicked 1>r1e,forlli5
persistence makes him a tto11-obsef\lar,t ofthe Swmah (out ofreluGumce),
w1,I so he is always blama:b/e.""' Uprightness is also considered through
avoiding prohibited acts, the ~ameas it is considered through observing
religious obligations. Thus. such an upright person sho1.1ld not commit
the major sillS nor per6ii; tin committing a minor ont.>.
Furthermore, Allah has forbidden Muslims fton:i accepting the testi"'10ny oftb.e.slauc\erer (the one who accuses a chaste per.;on of committing adultery or forl'.rication without producing foot witnessesJ.
Likewise, by means of analogiq1J deduction, every one who has
eominitted a major sin is to be treated the same as the slanderer.
Jurisprudentially, a majo,r sin is the crime which deserves e.xeci,ting a
prescribed punishment i.n this world or is severely threatened against
(in the Qur'an or the Swmah) with a punishment in the Hereafter.
These sins. are like ·t ali,ng usury, delivering a false testimony, zina
{adultery or fornication1), robbery; drinking intoxicants and other
sins. Thereby, fhe testin,opy of the de.fom(ly disobedient person il
imaoceptable.
Tht.> second sign by whic!h one's uprighrness is known ist espectability,
namely observing thegoE,d deeds and having the traits that beaoti.fy<l!ld
adorn one's character and conduct,•such as generosity, good manner~,
an.:! neighbortiness. It al;;o involves nvoidlng 'Whatever may disbonor

Whenever these afore-said impediments !'lreventing the accept~bility
of 1he lestimony cease to exist, the testimony becomes acceptable,
Hence, when 1he child reaches puberty, the insane person regains

'l'he testimony of the following is (legally) unacceptable:
•

A person 1.estifying in favor of his parents and forefathers 11nd on
up ill ascendiqg lineage or in .favor of his offspring and on down lo
descettding lineage. This is because one's testimony then is doubtful dtle
to being a relative Qf the liti'g-.mt one testifies for. However, testimony
is acc;ept-l!ble from a brother for his brother and from a friertd for his
friend according to the geneml meaning of the verses .rdated to such
an issue and since testimony then ,s not doubtful.

• The testimony of a spouse for the othec is unacceptable, for each of
them is already obtaining benefit from the other"& property, arid also
because of the dose relationship combini11g both; all this makes theirtestimony in favor of each other doubtful. However, testimony ar the

Allah, J:.xalted be He, say.s,

"... be peNistently sta,iding firm -in jU$tice, wltn=es for Allah,
even ifit be against yourulvf$ orparents and ,ela#ves..."
(Qur'rui: An-Nisa': 135)
That is to say, ifone testifies against one's parent, child. wife or the latter
testifies against h~r husband, the testimony in thi~ case is acceptable,
• l'he testimony ofa person that may get him,some benefit or sparehip,1
r.ome harm is unacceptabl.e,
• The testimony of a person agoinst his enemy is unacceptable. In this-

Chapth 7: T~cinmnv

regard, the great scholar Iboul-Qayyim says:

"The Shari'11h ha.s decreed that testimony is rmacceptable when born
by someone against his/her enemy. lest testimony be used as a preiexr to
gain benefit or avenge oneselffrom one's enemy through perjury.. : "'
Animosity which renders one's testimony unacc-eptable Is the rase of
being happy when another person is in adversity or sorrow, or un•
happy when he is in prosperity ot j.oy. I' t is worth mentioning that the
animosity IT!eant hel'e is the worldly one, unlike animosity in reUgion;
thereby the testilJiOlty of a bi!lieVet agaii1st a disbeliever is acceptable.
Llkewlse, the testimony of one following the Sun11af1 against an
innovator in religion is acceptable, since Jsiam enjoins Muslims
not to commit whatever is prohibited.

• rn addition, Lhe testimony of a ,person know1, to be a bigot and of
extreme-zealotry for his clan is not to be accepttd, Si.nee his testimony
will then be doubtful.

The number of witnesses differs according to
the case or issue testified in
Tftestimony concerns a case of zi11tl (adultery or fomicatiort),or sodomy. it fo
not accepted unless there are four male wi.tnesses. as Allah, Exalted be He, says:
"... W1,y diil they I who slanderecl] not produce forit four wit
nessesr..."
(Qur':\n: An- Nur: 13)
Since Muslims are ordered to conceal the faults of their Muslim brothers
and so the faults of those commitfingany of those sins, the number of witnesses
is four males.
When testimony concerns-proving the insolvencr of a person known to be
we.altlly but claiming the opposite, then it requires t!u~e male witnesses, according
to the haclith related'by lm1tm Muifon in which the Prophet {PBUH) says:

•~. u11til three wise persons from amongst his people witness that so
and so (i-.e. that person) ha.s been smitten by poverty.''u
If festimimy cuncerns the prescrlbed punishments for o,mes other ihan
zina, such as the prescribed punishment for slander, drinking intOlfkants,
robbery and banditry, or if it .concerns qli~ (legal' retribution), then it is
valid t.o accept tlie testimony of only two male witnesses. Also, in such cases,
women's testimony is unacceptable.

738

.Xlll QAMOlJUICIARY)

If'tesliinony concerns matten; other than the prescribed punishments or
financial affairs, which men often see ot witness, Sllch as marriag11, divorce
or remarriage to one's. revocably divorced wife, then two male witnesses
may testify. Sbaykhul-1s1ii1n Ibo Taytr1iyah and his disciple Ibnul-Qayyim
(may Allah have m~rcy on them both) maintain that if testimony concerns
remarriage with ,one's rcvocably divo"cd wife, then women's testimony :is
acceptable, sioce it is easier for them to be present at that time than at the time
of writing tbe documenlS (l,e.. m.1rrfage or divorce contract~).

If testimony concerns properties and tra·nsactions related thereof, sucb as
!l!lles, renting and the lll<e, then tW<, men or a man and two women ar~ to
kstify, for Allah, Exalted be l:le, Sa)'s:

(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 282)
The context ofthis verse Signifies that testimony l1ere cuncerns financial~Jfairs.
'.t,11e great Musi tin scholnr lbnul-Qa)'}'llll (may Allah haw mercy on him) says:

'<

Thewisdom behind accepting \he testimony of women in financial affairs
- Allah, Exalted be He. knows best - is thnt ih such transactions both men aud
women oft~a "~mess them; thereupon, the Slwrf 'ah allows men and women
to testify in 5ucll affairs.
Allah; Exalted be He. has sl"~lcd that a man's ijiare equals that of twQ women in
many rulings, such as testimony, inheritance, diya/1 (blood money), slaughtering
for a newborn child, and eJl\ancip~tion, Allah, Exalted be }ie, hn.1 demoostrated
the wisdom behind this ln 1-iis statement In the Glorious Qw:'an:

''..,so /hat if 011c of them {i.e., the 'WOt11e11] errs, then the other
can remin<f her..."
(Qur'an: Al-Baqarah: 282)
That is, if eitl11t1· of the two female witnesses forgets (any of the details of
what she has witne.!>'Seg), the other woman may remind ber. This ls because

7311

women, by nature, tend to forge,t, which readers the testimony of two women
equal to that of on1c man. Vei, if t!ie festlmony of a woman were to be Wbolly
unacceptable, this would lead lo wasting many rights <1nd rendering thern
ineffective. That is why a woman'.s testimony is added to that of another won.,an
to remind each other in case an)' of them forgets.
Besides, if testimony conce,m s financial affaits, 11 is sufficient for the
plaintiff to have a male witness togethe,· with faking an Oath. This is baseo •on
the lladitl, i n which lbn 'Abbas <(may Allah be pleased with him) said:

''TheMes.engerPJAllah (PiBUli) decreet,i {hqt t~s/i,n,;my (conccr,ilng

( Related,by !mom Ahmad and other compiler.~ of tid1th) ''

In this concern, lml\m Ahmad (may Allah have mercy on him) said, "JI is
stated in the SuntJah !,h at "jndgme11/ can be based ,m tf,e testimq1,y of a male
witness along wit!• tl,e oath of th,: plaint/ft'
In this connection, lbnul-Qayyim suid:

"... Tliis ruling (accepting (he testimtmy of a male wftness along 111itlt
tke oath of the plaintiff ill .flna11cial affairs) does 11or contradict the

Letters ;1mong Judges,
Testifying to Testimony,
and Takini~ Back Testimony
A judge may send a letter for another judge if necessary; for example, a
person may be living in another town other than his and he has a right that
he cannot substantiate or claim ;except in front of the judge of his town. In this
case, the judge of the town where he lives is allowed to send a letter to that ofthe
other town to complete legal procedu.-es. That is because it may be difficult for
witnesses to travel; besides, they (nay be known (concerning their uprightness) in
a town but not in the other. Due to the above, it would be difficult to substantiate
one's right or claim without a letter sent from a judge to another.
Muslim scholars uniformly agree upon accepting the letter sent from a
judge to another for proving and establishing rights. In this connection, Prophet
1
Sulayman (Solomon) (PBUH) sent a letter to Bilqls; the Prophet (PBUH)
also sent letters to An-Najashi (Negus, King of Abyssinia), Qay~ar (Caesar,

74!2

Xlll qt1DA' UUD)CIAAY)

1he Roman emperol') and to Kisrii (Khosrau, King of Persia) inviting them
all to embrace Islam. He lP.BlJH) used 10 send letters to Muslim governor, in
Mamie countries <IS rec:urren.tly related in many h.adiths. All the above prove
the legality of sending.letters among judges for proving rights and the like.
1t is worth mentioning here that the letter sent from a judge to another
is acceptable when related to people's rlghts and ls 11nacceptable in cases of
the. !inti!, set by All;an (i.e.. prescribed punishments}, sud1 as the prescribed
punishments for• committin,g :;;ind. (adultery or fornication) llnd drinking
intoxicants. This ls based on the ract that such div.ine limits are Allah's.rights
which are based upon concealing the fault of those violating :my of them and
their prescribed punishmentu are not to be applied on suspicious proofs.

The letter sent by a Judge to anothu is one of two types:
• The first 1ype: The letter sent by n judge including a juc\gment of hls- t\1
be effected by·his counteipart..Jn this case, Ifie letter is acceptable even
if the two judges are In the- ~ame town, since the judgment of a judge is
to be applied whatever the case may be; othetwise, judgments would be
su~pended and ,disputes would i'ncrease.
• The second type: The 1etter including whatever the sending judge has
proved andsubstanti~ited to hll taken as evidence in giviJ1gthe.judgment
by his counterpart 11 l,s.stipulated, however, that the distanoebetween the
two judges is equal to ot Olote 1han the distance that entails shortening
prayer. That is becaui,e it is an act of transferring a wr'itten testimony
to the recelve(, his cqunte1·part; thereby, it is impermissible when the
distance between the sending judge and the ~ceiving one is close.
The wording ofsubstantiation may be as follows: "It has been proved to me that
so and so owes so and so such and such a right:' However, substantiation is not a
judgment: it is rather informing the other judge about what has been proved_
In this connectJon, Shelklh •Abdur-Rabmlin lbn Qasim says,

"It ts permissible to se~111 ri /elle,· to ti judge co11taini11g what has
been proved to anothei· judge when the distance between both is
equal to or more tlum i!lie distance that entails shortening prayer,
eyen if the sender ,views lh,11 ft is imper,mi.;s/ble to issue a J11dgmelit
on the basis of what has bee11 pro11ed to him. This is because he.only
t1iforms the receivlngjudge about what is proved and the latter may
issue his judgment aci;c,rdi11g to what has been proved If he views
such proofs as v,1/id.·'

Chapter 8: l.,n«f acnoogJudgcs, 1<stilying to Tcnimony. aod ...

Furthermore, it is permissil~lirfor a judge to send a leuer to an unspecified
judge; the wotdhig may be as 6oUows: "To whomever receives my Jetter of the
Muslim judges;• without specifying a certain person. Whatever judge receives
such a letter has to accept ilsince it is sent from a judge to another judge. Thus:,
it is the same as the case when the letter is sent to a certain judge.
There are 1wo views concerning the acceptability of the letter sent to another
judge. The fus[ view is that the.judge must call two upright witnesses to testify
lo it. Those·two witnesses 11Te to defme its meaning and the rulings related to
what it: in'1udes. The second viiew is that it is permis.slble to act upon a .letter
sent from n judge 10 another when t.he receiving one know, the handwriting
of the sendin,g jµ dge, even tf (here are no witnesses. This is one of the views
reported to be adopted by Im/Im Ab_mad. However, at the present time, tl\e
formai sea) of the courr 'is sufficient and takes the place of witnesses.

In tliis regard, lmam lbnul.. Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) says,
"The PrllJ1het's Companions ha,,a 1.miformly agreed upon acting
accordiHg to matters pro11ed a11d ,~corded in a letter se.111 to one
another. The same ha.t bee,i observed by the Muslim Caliphs. !tis wellkn1Jw11 that people always,depen,J-0/l what is included;,, manuscripts
and ktters; if they were no•I to acl cUpon What those writings include.
tire laws of $/1ar1'11h (Islamic Law) would not be in effea·:'

Imam ibnul-'Qayylm adds:
''. .. Muslim ca/Ip/is, J11dges; rulers and governors /wvc lieen acting
upon letters they used' to s,md to each othe1: '!'hey would not infonf/
persons carryi11g su.h Jetten ab9ut the co/ltcllt tliey inciuded nor read
them in their presence. Thi.s is the way according to which people used
to·tiehaveduring iT1e lifetime of /he Pmphet (PBUH) until present."

lbnul-Qayyim goes on saying:
';,. The purpose intended .here is t/1ai the judge receiving 1he letter
must be certain of the per.·011 who hPs written it. If the /iandwriting
is known with certainty that it is of ,1 ,certain perso11, II becomes /he
same as ascribing a certain speech to ltfm. All!,lli, Exalted be lrfe, has

Sheikh Ta4iyyud-Dtn Ibo 'faymiyah {may Allah have merq on him) says:
~ ..-And whose handwrifi11g is recognized by way of confession, style of

writing or 11 le.stimo11y, should be t1cted upon ..."'
As for testifying to a testimony, it refers to a ca.sc when someone asksaoother
to testify \0 the testirnony of (he former. He may s·ay, •Testify to my 1estimo11r
that ...; or "Testify that l beat witness that ...• and the like. It, mfact, bears the
meaning of representation where the fust witness is refetred ,t o llS the original,
witness and the other as the secondary witness. In this regard, Abii 'U1>ayd
said, ''.Muslim sclwlars from tlte people of Hejaz s and Iraq uniformly agree on
accepting tlie testifying to a testimot,y it1 cases related' to financial affairs:• 1mam
Alllllad was asked about testifying to a ,t estimony, and h~ replied saying. ~ .. It
is permissible." Nece.,;sity, ln fact, requires accepting testifying to a ·testimony. If
it were unacceptable, testimony would Q.01 be in effect a.J\d judgments would
be suspended. In addition, in some cases, some pfoofs may be established late.
or witnesses may die before testifying, which causes liarm to people and 1&
considered a severe difficulty. This is why·it ts obligat.o ry•to accept testifying to
11 testimony the same·as the original testimony is accepted.

To accept testifying to a testimony, there are
many conditions that must be fulfilled:
Pltst: The original witness must.give permission to the secondary witness
,t o testify to his testimony; since testifying to one's testimony means
representation that is to be done on!y with one's permission.

Second: Testifying to a lestimony must be in cases where it,is permissible
that a judge sends to another as mention~ before, namely, in cases
where people!s rigbts rather than Allah's limits are concerned.

Third: When the testimony of the original witness is unattainable because of his death, illness, absence in a place far a~y, feaT of a ruler
and the like.

Fourth: The circumstai1ces hindering the testimony of the original witness continue until giving the juqgment.

Fifth; Both the original and the representative witnesses must be
characterized by uprightness until the judgment is issued.
Sil:: The representative witness must declare the ldentity-of the original
witness on whose behalf he is assuming the responsibility of testifying.

As for the rulings on taki:ng back one's testimony,
they are as follows:
• lf the Witnesses in cases pertaining to financial affairs take back their
testimony, the juqgmenl does nol becom~ null, since it has been
already issued; besides, 'the plainfiff has beoome entitled to take what
ha& been testified to belo,1igto him. However, the wimes~es are accused
of ,trying to nullify the judgment, 60 the judgment is to take effeGt
and the witnesses are to 'be fined the equivalent of what they testified
to, s'lnce they thus unlawfully deprived l:he real owner of his rightful
prqperty.

• If the fudge gives a judgment according to the testimony of a witness
and an oath (taken by the plaintiff), and the witness lakes back his
testimony, the witness iSc to guanmtee the whole proper!)' in dis_pute,
for the whol'e claim is based on his tes1imony. Moreover, the oath .is to
be taken by the plaintiff.and ii i6 oot necessarily acceptable against the
other party (as proof). since it is only one of the conditions for giving
the judgment
• lfthe witnesses take back their testimonies before the.judgment is issued,
·t he judgment is to be cancelled and the witnesses arc not accountable

Oath:s in Claims

Taking an oath is one of the 11:gal procedures, for the Prophet (PBUH) said:

''. .. The oath is to be sworn by the defendant.'''
Thereby, the oath is to be taken by the defeodant if the plaintiff does not
have any proof against him. The oath does end the dispute but does not annul
the plaintiff's right. That is to sa:r, if the plaintiff establishes evidence after the
case is ended, his proof is to be taken in considerat,oli and the judgment is
to be in his favor. Likewise, if the defendant takes back his oath and returns
whatever right he owes to the pl,aintiff, it is then considered acceptable and it
is permissible for the plaintiff to take what he claims to be his.
Oaths are to be specifically sworn concerning people's rights, which is not
the case concerning the rights ,of Allah, Exalted be He, such as the acts of
worship, and the prescribed pumishments. ff a Muslim says, "I bave already
paid the Zakflh due on mC:' or '"There is no atonement or expiation due on
me," this ts acceptable from him, and be is not to be asked to take an oath. The

Xlll QADA'UUDICIARY)

748

same goes for a Muslim whoo denies transgressing the limits set by Allah; he is
not to be asked to take an oath, since it is de'Sirable to conceal people's faults,
Besides, if someone confesses transgressing a divine Hmit, then takes back his
confession, !his is to be acEeptable from him and he is to bereleosed. Tuus, it is
woqhier not to ask such a person to take an oath without having confessed.
• Taking an oath is worthless in claims relating to people's rights, except
when the judge ord~rs the defendant to swear upon the request of the
plaintiff. In this case, the onth is to be in the fotm 0£ an aJlSWer to the
plaintiff.
• Taking an oath is to be do11e ln the assembly of the judge.
• An oath fs valid onlr if sworn by Allah, Exalted be He, since taking an
oath by other than Allah is an act ofpolytheism.
• When taking an oath by Altah, it is sufficjent to say, "By Allah ..."
which suffices as an oath, Taking an oath with these words has been
I!}entioned in man11 position& in the 'Glorious Qur'An. Allah, Exalted
be fie, says:

': ..And they swear·by Allah their strongest oaths..."
(Qur'An: Al-An' am: 109)
And.He says;

': ..and let them bo,t11 swear by Allah..."
(Qur'~n: Af-Ma'idah: 106)
He also s.ays:

•~ ..four testimonU?J; [sweari11g] by Allah..."
(Qur'l\n: An-Nur: 6)
Besides, the word "J\llab'' is a proper name which indicates one of the
Best Names attributed to•none but Him, Exalted be He.

• A. solemn oaU, is only raken concerning matters of great importance,
such as a crime that does not necessitate legal retribution or emancipating a slave (at lthe time of~lavery). In sucb cases, the judge may
ask the defendant t,~ swear a solemn oath, su.ch as saying: "By Allah,
otbet than Whom there is no deity, the Knower of the unseen and
the witnessed, the Predominant, the Harm-foflicting, the BenefitGiver and the Knower .o f that which deceives the eyes and what the

Co:nfession

Jurispmdentially, confession refers to acknowledging that one owes a right
to someone else. In fact, confession is just an act of acknowledging rights which
one owes others; it does not establish a new right. In this concern, Sheikh
Taqiyyud-Dh1 Jbn Taymiyab (ma,y Allah have mercy on him) said:

"Ifsomeone informs (ti 11erso11) about what he owes others, then he is
a confessor, and if he inform,; (a person) a/,oul what others owe him,
Ihm he is n plaintiff. 111 case someone informs about rights which a
person owes others, wlrile h,~ is e111ri1s1ed with such rig/its, he tlms
is regarded as a mere repor/'er. lfow,iver. if lie is 11ot entmsted with
such rights, he the11 is rega~ded as n witttess. The. judge, the agent,
the scribe, the guardia11 and the authorized person, are. all entrusted
with whatever jobs they perform. However, if they arc dismissedfrom
their oj)ices and inf'Orm <1/101,1t wh<1t they k11ew, this is not co11sidered
a to,ifession, it is ratl,cr inftwming."'

752

Jbn Taymiyah then adds-''
".... Confession does not est11blish a ne1V right; rather it brings right Into
light and informs pt:ople about what one owes others."
• There are many conditions lltat must be fulfilled to make the confe.~sion
valid, one of which is. that it is valid wh~ the confessor is legally
accountable. Hence, it is not valid when made by a child, ao insane
person or ca sleepirng person. However, confession is acceptable, and
legally 6inding, from a minor provided that it mu!lt be within the

limits specified for him in commercial affairs.
• Also, confession mutst be made with one:s,free1vill. Tllat is, confession
is not acceptable when one is forced, except when confessing to a lhil1g
other than what on,c has been forced to confess to.
• Moreover, confessic,n is not valid wnen 1he confessor is interdicted; the
confession ofa weak-minded person ls not legally valicl
• Confession is not to be made to a thing l n other people's possession or
under other people'i; guardianship. as in cases where a stranger confesses
(claims) the paternity of a child or confesses ,to an endowment which
belongs to another jperson or is under someone else's guardianship,

• If the confessor d laims that he has confessed jnvoluntar,ily, thi5 is
accepted froro hlm provided that he introduces a proof substantiating
whot 'he claims.
• The confession of a sick person that a property belongs to apy one
other thaq the legal 'h~ii:s is legally binding, since ne is not suspected of
showing favoritism . Moreover, when one is sick, one is keen to return
whatever rights onJ=owes others.
•

If -s omeone claim:; that another person owes nun something and
the respondent aclknowledges this person's claim, the respondent's
acknowledgement is acceptable and binding as welL and it i,s regarded
as a confession \\lhich be is bound to. Tbls i~ according to lite b.adith of
the Prophet (PBUH) ip which he 6aid:

"There is no excuse for the Ohe who confesses."'
• Confession isvalid ;1nd legally binding when declared with any wording
indicating confession. For example, the respopdent may say (to the
plaintiff), ''You have told the truth," or "Yes,'' (as a confirmation to his
.claim) or "l confesi, to that."

ChaP,tcr 'J 0: Confusion

753

• It ls vaiid to exclude hal1f,or less of the total amount (or whatever one
owes another) when con,fessittg. 1bat is to say when one confesses that
he owes someone ten (ofsuch and such a thing) except five ofit,. he is
bound to give hlin five. The style of exclusion is used at many positions
in the Glorious Qur'an: Allah, Exalted be He, s.ays,
": ..a11d'l1e remained among them a tltousa11djMrs ,ninusfift-y
years•.•"
(Qur'an: Al-· A.nkabCtt 14)

In addition. many scholars maintain that it is permissibie for the
conf~ssor to excJ4d~ more than half.
• To b~ valid, exclusion in ccmfession must be said nonstop. lf theconfe&sat
says, "J owe so-and-so o,ne hundred (of an article, for example)." then
he pauses though he ca.n continue, then he says, "profitless" or ''on
credit," the confessor then is bound to glve him one saJeable hundred
on the spot Besides, wh,atever the confessor says after his pause is not
to be taken jnto considc:ration, sioce he thus tties to temove a right
which is already bindinB; on him.
• lf someone sells somethi 11g ot gives if as n g-tft, and then lie confesses
that flus thing belongs to someone else, his confession is not lo be
accepted. Moreover, neither the sale nor any other transaction relattd
to this property becomes nu(~ since be confesses to something· that
belongs to sonwone else. In additlo11 to tnis, the c.onfossot is .to pay 1:he
VlllUe of the object to the original owner in compensation, sin~t the
'latter has been deprived of his rightful property.
• Confession is vaiid and :!egally binding when lt concerns a thing the
confessot does not e.xactly specify, which could be interpreted in two
ways or more, all'being the same for the confessor.

• 1fa .petson coniesses saying, "I owe so-and-so such ancl such a thing;'
his confession ls valid and legally binding. Yer he is to be asked to
explain what· he inlende d and make himself dear so as to be liable
foe it ln tase the confes!;or refuses to point QUI what he i nt.e nded, he
is to be·put under·arrest.'lllltil be points out what he intended. This-is
b=u5e the oonfessor must mail:e clear what he has intended to.say, for
it is a right that he has to clarify and give to its owner. lftbe confessor
denies knowi11g the object to which lie ha,; confessed, he is to take an
oath confirming that Besides, he i6 to pay to its owner a fine equ:al to
I.he least walue bf that ,object. If the confessor dies before explaining
whathe has intended, hi~ heirs are.not to be responsible for giving 11 to

754-

its ,ov;ner. even if the confessor has ieft an estate, for that thingmight
be something other than 11 property,
• lfsomeone says, "I owe so and so o sum less than,one thousand,"' it is to
be interpreted as having intended what ls less than \he half.

• If someone says, for e,rample, "I owe so and so an amount between one
dirham and ten,'' he is.to give eight dirhams to the owner since this is the
meaning he has intended; eight is the number betwl!en oneruid ten.
• ff someone says, "I owe so and so an amount from one dirham to .ten,"
one is to give nine dirhams io ihe owner, for the ~ximum number
(which is ten here) is not included in what is Intended by the confessor;
Besides, some scholars maintain that if the extreme limit is of\he same
kit1d of the thing intended, it is to be considered a part of the total;
otherwise, it is not to be included.
• If someone confesses saying, "The space between this wall and 1he other
wall belongs to so and so," the two walls are not to be uicluded, for he
only hBs confessed to whatever ts between them.
• Ifsomeone confesses that a rree or some trees belong to someone else, his
confes.sien does not indude the land. Thus, neither the rightful owner
of the trees bas the right .t o replant them in cose they are removed
nor does the own~r of rhe land haw the right to remove them , Thls is
because ii is obvibll5 that !he trees have been rightfully planted.
• If someone confesses that a garden helongs ·to someone else, his
confession indud.ts the trees., the b11ildings and the land, s)nce tht
garden refers ro all these things.
•

If someone con/esse:, owing someone some dales in a bag, a knife
in d sh<1ath, or·a garment in a wrapping, his confession includes the
enveloped object (the dates, t he knife or the .garment) ratbe.r than
the envelope (the bag, shenth, 01· the wrapping). This is because the
enveloped object and the envelope are not the same, for the forme,
does nol completely absorb the lotter; Besides, the enveloped object and
lhe envelope do not necessarily belong to one person, and confession
is not binding in probable cases where there may be more than one
owner of the objecL

• If someone confesses saying, "I aud.so and-so share ~e ownership of
such and such an qbject," he is to determine the share of his partner.
Some scholars mnintain that ln such cases each partner is considered

as having an equal shMe ,acco,ding•10 lhe general rule stating tl)at "the
partnership in general eiltail, having equal skates"'. Allah, Exalled be
!::le, says:

"... they s/11,re a third.-.''

(Qur'An: An-Nisa': I 2)

If anyone owes any right to olthers, he must make a confession statlng that
when oecessaty. Allah, Exalted b,e He, says:

"O you who lurve believed, be persistently standing jinn in

jusllae, wllmsses for Al/11111, rven ifIt be against yourselves..."
(Qur'an: An-Ni~a': l'.35)

And He.says:
". ..a11d let tJ1e one 111ho has tl1e o/;/igqtfo11 [i.e., the debtor/ dictate.
.A11d let liim fea t: Allah, hi's Lord, and 110( le,we anytiring out ofit.
.Bid iftire one who has th,e obligation is oflimited understandillg
or weak or unable to dictute himself, the11 let Iris guardian dictate

(Qur';in: AI-Baqarah: 282)
In this regard. in his book entilled Al-Kdfl (TheSiyficietu), AI-Muwaffaq said:

''. . .Dirtntion in this v~rse means £onfessio11, n11d 11,e judgment must
be i.<$ued accordirtg to the confessiort, for the Propher (PBUH) ftas

lie (PBUH) ordered tlint Mil 'iz nndAI-Ghamidiyyah (a woman from
the tribe of Ghlimid) be stoned to death after confessing that they
bad committed e1dultery (ir.1 two separn/e tascs). Moreover. since 1:1
judgment must be given accordll1g to the substa11Ht1ted proofs, r.he;, ii
is worthier lo be given by vil"fue of an undoubled confessfon."
And, al! praise be to Allah, t!ie Lord of the ,Vorlds.
Finally.gentle reader, here is an ab5lrnct of the Islamic jurisprudence between
your hands, and I seek Allah's For;giveness for whatever mis1akes or defects may
