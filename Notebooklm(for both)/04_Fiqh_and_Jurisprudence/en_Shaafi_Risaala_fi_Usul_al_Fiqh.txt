T H E ISLAMIC T E X T S SO C IE T Y

THE PART OF TH E world in which Islam grew up
is renowned for possessing the oldest legal systems known in
recorded history, and Islamic law, more than a millenium
old, is relatively hew in comparison with other systems. In
Islamic legal theory the law preceded society and is considered
to be as eternal as God. Tradition has it that God revealed
himself through a divine law, communicated to men by His
Prophets, either written by God's own finger on tablets made
of stone, or sent down to the nearest Heaven to be available
for revelation by Angel Gabriel.
Originating from so high a source, law always held a para­
mount place in the eyes of peoples who lived under divine
guidance. It is no wonder that the prestige of the divine law
among peoples in that world is without parallel in history.
For the law was not only founded on religion and sanctioned
by God, but in it the whole spirit of the faith may be said
to be epitomized.
Islamic law has preserved its basic character since its forma­
tive period. In modern times the greatest challenge has come
from the West, and Islamic law is bound to feel the impact.
Many a Muslim country has adopted legal concepts from
abroad without regard to their suitability for the social milieu.
Muslim and Western legal systems have often operated side by
side and conflicts between them have been inevitable. But
the new law has not been able to command the respect of the
public nor has the old law met the necessities of modern life.
However, the advocates of the traditional system have had

little to offer in the way of a constructive legal reform which
might adapt Islamic law to modern conditions of life. In the
second and third decades of the twentieth century critics of
the two systems keenly felt that the widening gulf between
them should be bridged.
Following World War II a revival in the study of Islamic
law set in, stemming partly from the rise of several Islamic
countries to statehood. Some of the new states stressed the
Islamic creed, and the older states declared Islamic law to be
a source of legislation. The most constructive approach to
modernizing Islamic law is reflected in the new civil codes,
notably in the law of contract and property, which Dr. *Abd
al-Razzaq al-Sanhurl has drafted for Egypt, Syria, ‘Iraq, and
Libya. As a result, a growing interest in the study of Islamic
jurisprudence has become noticeable in the Muslim world, in
an effort to gain a deeper understanding of the nature of legal
reform.
The Muslim world today is facing a problem of legislation
not unlike that which faced it in the first two centuries of its
existence. During that time Islam expanded rapidly and
absorbed new elements of culture and^ tradition. As a result,
the Muslim world abounded in legal doctrines, the advocates
af each vying for supremacy over the others. It was Shafi'i who
provided in the ninth century of the Christian era a systematic
legal method by which to synthesize the various legal doctrines
into a coherent system. A thorough study of that system will
Explain how legal problems were resolved in the formative
Deriod as well as the approach and the method of reasoning
employed in their solution. It is impossible to understand the
triplications and the trends in modem Islamic legal reforms
vithout an appreciation of the nature and development of
:Iassical Islamic jurisprudence.
I have been assisted by important suggestions and com*
nents made on the work as a whole or in-part. I should like
o thank in particular Shaykh Muhammad Abu Zahra and
3r. ‘Abd al-iyallm al-Najjar for their valuable assistance, and

Translator’s Introduction

THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
OF THE RISALA
Islamic Jurisprudence before Shafi'i
LAW IS A SYSTEM of social control established for
the purpose of maintaining an ordered society among men.
Different societies develop different legal systems, but every
matured system reveals the ways in which the society from
which it sprang endeavors to protect what it honors. Islamic
law, the product of Islam’s centuries of stored experience, is
the embodiment of the Islamic ideal life. It is the framework
of Islam itself. For although religion describes what the ideal
life should be, the law indicates the right road to follow
(indeed the term shari'a bears this meaning) in order to
arrive at the ideal life. Thus the law of Islam, the shari'a, has
the character of a religious obligation; at the same time it
constitutes a political sanction of religion. As a consequence,
the sharl'a has greater practical importance to Muslims than
the creed, and its study is ranked higher than a supererogatory
prayer by ShafrI, the founder of a school of law and the author
of the Risala.
In Islamic legal theory the sharl'a is derived from a high
divine source, embodying God’s will and justice. Unlike posi­
tive law, it is regarded as the ideal legal order; but, like posi­
tive law, it mirrors the character of the society in which it
3

developed. The idealization of the shari'a as the perfect legal
system was the product of legal speculation which occupied
the minds of jurists for generations; but the one who for the
first time laid down a systematic legal reasoning for such an
idealization was Muhammad b. Idris al-Shafi'i. The impress
of his systematic method, which has never been superseded in
Islam, has remained permanent.
In what circumstances did Shafi'i develop his system?
The Founder of Islam, whose main preoccupation was with
religious reform, had, perhaps, little reason to alter the sunna,
the customary law prevailing in Arabia.1 Muljammad’s oppo­
nents argued, however—not without good reason—that he had
violated the established Jaw of the land. Notwithstanding
Muhammad’s reiteration that he merely intended to replace
false idols by Allah, the repudiation of idolatry itself implied
the violation of the sunna, since idolatry was part of the cus­
tomary law of Arabia. Law and religion were so closely inter­
twined in primitive societies that an attack on religion was a
violation of law at the same time. Muhammad’s call to aban­
don idolatry in favor of the Deity resulted inevitably in the
establishmentof the supremacy of God’s law—as communicated
in the Qur'an—over “ idolatrous ” law. Thus the Qur'an became
the basic source of legislation. The sunna, though it con­
tinued to supply raw material for legislation, took second place
in the eyes of the Muslim community.
Muhammad's death, though coinciding with the sudden
expansion of Islam, brought prophetic legisation to an end.2
The administrative decrees issued by the early caliphs (suc­
cessors to Muhammad) supplied answers to many legal prob­
lems; but disputes and legal questions relating to purely local
matters were bound to be settled on the basis of the custom
* T he sunna was the common law of Arabia before Islam, and it com­
prised legal and moral principles. T he sunna grew out of the custom of
the forefathers and its enforcement by practice established its legal validity.
See I. Goldziher, " T h e Principles of Law in Islam,’’ The Historians' His­
tory of the World (New York, 1907), Vol. VIII, pp. 294-304.
* Muhammad is regarded as the last of the prophets (Q. XXXIII, 40);
thus divine legislation came to an end by his death.

and precedent of each locality. Tribal customary law existed
in Arabia before Islam, just as laws and customs in Syria and
‘Iraq were inherited from earlier civilizations. Roman (Byzan­
tine) and Persian (Sasanian), to say nothing of earlier Baby­
lonian and Aramaic, laws must have supplied the Muslim
jurist with raw material on the strength of which he issued
opinion whenever an authoritative text failed to provide an
answer.8
Several centers for legal study developed, stemming from
local differences in legal traditions and social conditions, but
the two principal centers which radiated their influence to
other parts of the empire were those of 'Iraq (Kufa and Basra)
and the Hijaz (Madina and Makka). The 'Iraqi jurists seem
to have won the reputation of exercising personal reasoning
more than the IJijazi jurists, and Abu Jianlfa (d. 150/767),
founder of a school of law, as well as his followers were
credited with the liberal use of analogy as the basis for their
legal reasoning. Abu Hanifa’s method of reasoning, reputed
to have been applied more extensively than those of other
jurists, was in fact the common method used by the 'Iraqi
jurists, while the IJijazI jurists, who claimed to follow the
tradition more consistently, actually used personal reasoning
no less than their 'Iraqi contemporaries. The IJanafl jurists
in fact paid more attention to traditions than their contempo­
rary critics claimed despite their reputation that they were
unacquainted with these traditions. Opinions of early 'Iraqi
jurists, such as Ibrahim al-Nakha'I (d. 95/713) or IJammad
b. Abl Sulayman (d. 120/737) were invoked on the strength
of traditions traced back to the Prophet Muhammad through
a transmitter like Ibn Mas'ud or Caliph 'All.* These tradi* For a discussion on the influence of foreign laws on Islamic law, see

tions may have included the sunna of the Prophet as well as
traditions from his Companions. But the attempt to justify
the adoption of local custom on the strength of traditions was
as much a recognition of the overriding authority of an au­
thoritative text as it was an unconscious effort to Islamize the
developing body of law in the newly conquered territory.
The re-assertion of the sunna after Muhammad's death was
probably more visible in the Ijfijaz than elsewhere. For in
Arabia it was customary that the Nsunna, whether laid down
by forefathers or by an individual of1some weight, should be
binding on the community. When Muliammad first intro­
duced Islam, he was denounced as the violator of the sunna
for attacking traditional idolatry. But when Islam was estab­
lished, the Prophet as the spokesman of the community was
cited to provide guidance for legal decisions. After his death
^Muhammad's sayings and decisions became precedents on the
strength of which jurists made decisions. These precedents
constituted the sunna of the Prophet and provided the sub­
stance of traditions.®
Against such a background the HijazI jurists could claim
that their school represented1 the school of tradition. They
resided in the cradle of Islam, where the sunna was better
known, and they set forth the doctrine that the sunna was
an overriding authoritative source. Thus the Malik! school,
known as the school of tradition, claimed that its legal opinion
represented the Islamic tradition more closely than the IJanafi
school. It criticized the ‘Iraqi jurists for their use of personal
opinion and analogy on the grounds that their knowledge of
the Prophet’s sunna was palpably lacking. However, a close
examination of Malik’s opinions indicates that he made use of
prudence,” in M. Khadduri and H. J. Liebesny (eds.), Law in the Middle
East {Washington, D. C., 1955), Vol. I, pp. 45-46.
8 After the rise of Islam the term sunna came to mean the sayings, acts,
and decisions of the Prophet Muhammad; later on the substance of the
sunna, in addition to the authorities who transmitted it, was called hadith
or tradition. See Chaps. IX and X, below. See also I. Goldziher, Etude
cur la tradition Islamique, tr, L£on Bercher {Paris, 1952); and Alfred
Guillaume, The Traditions of Islam (Oxford, 1924).

t r a n s l a t o r ’s i n t r o d u c t i o n

personal opinion no less than his Hanaf! contemporaries. One
may even discern that Malik had departed from the Prophet’s
sunna in favor of personal opinion. A case in point is Malik's
insistence that a contract, once concluded by an offer and
acceptance, regardless of the kliiyar al-majlis (right of option
of the parties to a contract as long as they have not separated) ,
was binding on the two parties.* Malik's opinion was based
on local practice; but sound though it may seem from a legal
viewpoint, it conflicted with the doctrine of the Malik! school
that the authority of tradition was always overriding.7
The place occupied by Shaft'! in Islamic legal history is
determined largely by the character of the age in which he
lived. In a later age, once the gate of ijtihad (personal reason­
ing) had closed, he would have been a great jurist with a
moderate view as to the development of the law. But in his
age a great jurist was necessarily drawn into ikhtilaf (disagree­
ment) , or the controversy between the schools of tradition and
personal opinion. What was to be the position of tradition
in relation to the Qur’an and other sources of the law? What
was to be the position of opinion and analogy in relation to
the Qur’an and tradition? At a time when scholars were
raising such questions, a man profoundly learned in the tradi­
tion, and passionately convinced of its significance, was com­
pelled to take part in the. controversy between the advocates
of tradition and the advocates of opinion in order to defend
the former’s claim to supremacy. At first, Shafii aroused those
in favor of tradition, giving them leadership and supplying
methods of defense against the advocates of opinion. Later
on, after settling in Egypt, Shaft'! seems to have felt more
strongly the need to strike a balance between the two schools
of thought, and he sought to find a common ground of
agreement.

'Abd al-BSql (Cairo, 1951), Vol. Ii, p. 671.
TThe tradition concerning khiyar al-majlis, however, might have been
circulated after MSlik’s death. See J. Schacht, Origins of Muhammadan
Jurisprudence (Oxford, 1950) , pp. 159-60.

8

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

Shafi'i’s Life
It was in this milieu that Shaft'! played so significant a role
in resolving the conflict between the two schools of law.
Growing dp in the Hijaz, the home of tradition, he became
a followed of Malik and then went to 'Iraq, where he was
exposed to the legal reasoning of the 'Iraqi jurists. In the
latter part of his life, in Egypt, where he could reformulate
his legal opinions with detachment and rewrite his books, he
founded a new school of Jaw by synthesizing the two other
schools. ShafiTs career falls, therefore, into three well-marked
periods. The first, the period of apprenticeship, begins with
his study of the law in Makka and Madina, where he was
given a thorough training in the traditions, and extends to
his deportation to 'Iraq. The second, in which he was exposed
to the legal reasoning of the 'Iraqi jurists, ends with his'departure for Egypt; and the third lasts from his settlement in
Egypt, where he became the “ master,” to his death.
A number of biographical accounts of Shafii have come
down jo us, although the very earliest are apparently lost.
Even in biographical sketches written by Dawud al-Zahiri (d.
270/884) and Zakarlya b. Yahya al-Saji (d. 30 / /920), repro­
duced in later accounts, a great deal of legend had already
crept into the story of ShafiTs life. The chronology presents
great difficulties, as the conflicting narratives about ShafiTs
visits to 'Iraq and his return to Madina indicate.
T he biographical accountyby Abu Muhammad *Abd alRahman b. Abi IJatim al-Ra#' (d. 327/938) is the earliest that
has reached us.8 Razi’s worty is scarcely more than a collection
of oral reports dealing with certain aspects of ShafiTs life and
character, some of them reproduced from earlier biographical
sketches such as those of al-Zahirl and al-Saji. But this source
is quite inadequate as a complete account. Later writers, who
dealt more fullyNvith the subject, have often drawn heavily

on Razi's biography and have reproduced many of the legends
that had gathered around ShafiTs life. The great works of
Abu Nu'aym 8 and al-Kha^ib al-Baghdadl10 add very little to
Razi’s account. The first full story is given by al-Bayhatp
(d. 458/1065) 11 and reproduced in a well-organized and attrac­
tive manner by al-Fakhr al-Razi;12 inevitably, it includes a
great deal of legend. Later biographers, notably Ibn ‘Abd
af-Barr,13 Subki,14 Ibn Idajar,15 and Nawawi,10 add but little
to earlier accounts. More recent sketches by Ibn K athlr17 and
Murtada al-Zabidl,18 draw heavily on earlier authorities. There
are also several unpublished biographical accounts19 which
add practically nothing new. A full critical study of ShafiTs
life has not yet been written.20
The earliest authorities disagree as to whether Shaft'! was
born at Gaza, a small provincial town on the Mediterranean
Sea, or at ‘Asqalan (Askelon), a larger town not far away, in

the year 150/767.21 Probably ShafiTs mother, shortly after
ShafiTs father died, spent some time in Palestine among the
Yamanite tribes—to whom her ancestors (the Azd tribe)
belonged—before she and her son arrived at Makka, for the
authorities state that Shafi'I was scarcely two years old when
he left Gaza, but that he had reached his tenth year when he
arrived at Makka.22 We know little about ShafM’s early life,
except that he was brought up in Makka in poor circum­
stances and that from his youth he was devoted to learning.
Traditional stories, legendary for the most part, give an
account of his early devotion to poetry, chivalry, and legal
studies. Such traditions have him learning the Qur'an by
heart at the age of seven, committing Malik’s al-Muwatta’ to
memory at the age of ten, and being declared fit to give legal
opinions at the age of fifteen.23
Certain facts about his parentage may conceivably have
affected the future course of his life,24 His father belonged to
the tribe of Quraysh, the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad,
and his grandfather al-Muttalib was a brother of Muhammad’s
grandfather. The descendants of al-Muttalib took an active
part, on both sides, in the struggle between Muhammad and
the Makkans, but they all supported Muhammad after his
first victory at Badr in 2/624. This history may have given
Shafi'I prestige, arising from his belonging to the tribe of the
Prophet and from his great grandfather’s kinship to the
Prophet. It also may have inspired him with the idea that to
him was bequeathed the mantle of the Prophet’s tradition and

the expansion of Islam.

that he should stand to defend it. These facts made him, like
other descendants of the same clan, a beneficiary of thev
prophet’s share of one-fifth of the spoils of war.25
After spending some time among the Beduins, Shaft’! re­
turned to Makka to study law under Muslim b. Khalid alZanji (d. 180/796), Mufti of Makka, Sufyan b. ’Uyayna (d.
198/813), and others.2* Although he was declared qualified
to practice Jaw by al-Zanji, Shaft'! desired further legal training
and set out to study under the leading jurist of the IJijaz,
Malik b. Anas (d. 179/796). He was probably twenty years
old when he left Makka for Madina.
There are several accounts of how Shaft'! became the dis­
ciple of Malik. The traditional story is that he went to the
Governor of Madina, armed with a letter of introduction from
the Governor of Makka, and requested ah audience with Malik.
After some hesitation, the Governor made his way to Malik’s
house in the company of Shaft*!. Malik seems to have been
impressed by ShafiTs intelligence, and he allowed him to read
al-Muwatta>under his guidance. As a follower of Malik, Shaft'!
remained in Madina until Malik’s death, by which time he
had already gained distinction as a brilliant jurist.27
Shaft*! had the good fortune to attract the attention of the
Governor of al-Yaman, who was on a visit to the Hijaz, and
who was impressed by his learning and industry. He helped
Shaft*! to enter the service of the state at about the age of
thirty and to rise rapidly in it. This service was short-lived,
however. Shaft*! proved to be a just administrator, but he was
soon entangled with local interests and factional jealousies,
which brought him not merely dismissal from his post but

also deportation in chains to ‘Iraq, on the alleged charge that
he was a secret follower of the Zaydi Imam Yahya b. ‘AbdAllah, a pretender to the caliphate and an opponent of the
ruling dynasty in Baghdad.28
Shafi'I appeared before Caliph Harun al-Rashid at al-Raqqa
{‘Iraq) with other conspirators in 187/803. The other com
spirators were put to death, but he was pardoned when he
eloquently defended his loyalty to the caliph on the ground
that he was the descendant of a great grandfather who was
related to the great grandfather of the caliph himself. Some
authorities state that the famous Hanafi jurist, Muhammad b.
al-Hasari al-Shaybanl (d. 189/805), who was present at the
court when Shaft*! appeared before the caliph, defended him
and said that he was a well-known student of the sacred law.29
Most authorities agree that the caliph was delighted with
ShafiTs conversation and became his patron.30 This incident
brought Shaft*! into close contact with Shaybahi, whose books
he had copied, and impelled him to devote the rest of his
career to legal studies, never again to seek government service.
The contact with Shaybani’s circle had a great impact on
ShafiTs legal reasoning. Until that point, as a follower of
Malik, he had been exposed to the teaching of only one school
of law. He had, it is true, known of the opinions and argu­
ments of the ‘Iraq! jurists, but he had not heard them at first
hand. We are told that he took an active part with Uanafi
jurists in discourses and arguments, that he strenuously de­
fended Malik's position, and that he seems to have earned the
reputation of being the Upholder of Traditions for his efforts
to establish the supremacy of .traditions.31 But those discus18 Another account places the story of the deportation in Makka, where
Shafi'i had returned from al-Yaraan. He may have been there on a short

sions must have made him aware of the weaknesses of the
Malik! school, which Shafii began to appreciate after settling
in Egypt, as well as the points of strength in the legal reason­
ing of the 'Iraqi jurists. Some authorities stress the difficulties
encountered by him in his arguments with the Hanafi jurists,
and one declares that Shafi'1 was driven out of 'Iraq by them.32
Most authorities, however, believe that ElanafI followers com­
plained to Shaybani of ShafiTs criticism, but that Shafi'i,
though avoiding a stand against Shaybani directly, determined
to stand oh his own in his legal reasoning. Some authorities
state that Shaybani, upon hearing the complaints of his fol­
lowers, invited Shafi'i to a debate on t^he points of difference
between them ;33 they also state that Shafi'i emerged trium­
phant over Shaybani, although Hanafi sources insist that
Shafi'i was defeated.84 These circumstances must have been
difficult for Shafi'i, who, as prot£g<§ of Shaybani, may have
tried honestly to avoid an open conflict with him, as some
authorities indicate.35 Nor was ShafiTs position strong enough
to take an open position against Shaybani, an influential man
at the court, and his followers.
This uncomfortable situation must have influenced Shafi'i
in the decision to leave 'Iraq in 188/804 and to settle else­
where. He went via blarran and Syria to Makka, where he
had begun his early legal studies. As a disciple of Malik, he
was well received and began to lecture at the Sacred Mosque.
His teachings, however, revealed unexpected differences with
Malik,*for his thorough grasp of the Malik! and Hanafi legal
opinions made him aware of the shortcomings of both. He
made a deep impression on many students of law, including
Ahmad b. IJanbal (d. 241/855), who was studying in Makka
at that time, but his influence in the liijaz must have been
limited. His departure from Malik’s opinions disappointed

many a Malik! admirer at a time when Shafi‘1 had not yet won
the reputation of the “ m aster/'86
Shafi'i returned to Baghdad in 194/810. His legal reasoning
had matured, and his stature as a jurist had grown sufficiently
to permit him to follow an independent line of legal specu­
lation. It was during this period that he accumulated the
material for the legal system that was destined to leave so deep
a mark upon Muslim law. After a span of three or four years,
Shafi‘1 decided to leave Baghdad for Egypt. It is not quite
clear why he made this decision. The authorities state that
while in Baghdad he attached himself to ‘Abd-AIlah b. Musa,
who invited him to settle in Egypt. We are told that the
Caliph al-Ma*mun (d. 218/833) offered him the position of a
judge, but he declined it.87
ShafiTs departure from ‘Iraq took place in 198/814. It was
the same year that the Caliph al-Ma’mun establishes himself
in Baghdad, having defeated his brother al-Amln a year earlier
and inaugurated a regime in which the rationalist philosophy
of al-Mu‘tazila assumed a predominant position. In 213/827
the Caliph officially proclaimed the doctrine of " the creation
of the Qur'an ” in opposition to the Orthodox view of its
eternal nature as co-existing with God. In 218/833 he decreed
that no qadi who did not subscribe to this doctrine could hold
an office in the state, and an inquisition for the trial of those
who rejected the doctrine was instituted.88 This anticipated
atmosphere of intolerance to orthodox views, it has been sug­
gested by a recent writer,89 drove Shafi'i to settle in Egypt. At
the age of fifty Shafi'i seems to have made his final choice
between his love for power and his love for the law, and he

decided to settle in a place where he could concentrate on
legal speculation in relative quiet.
Remote from the center of court intrigues, and on good
terms with the Governor of Egypt, Shaft*! found himself in a
congenial position. During the five years he lived in Egypt,
he devoted all his time to teaching and to dictating his works
to his students. We are told that his leading disciples—al-Rab!'
b. Sulayman al-Murad! (d. 270/880), Abu Ya'qub al-Buwayt!
(d. 231/845), and Abu Ibrahim Isma'fl b. Yahya al-Muzanl
(d. 274/877), to mention but three—were in the habit of
writing down ShafiTs spoken words, and that Shaft'! would
correct the text when it was read aloud before him.40 Thus,
ShafiTs disciples in Egypt were responsible for all of the books
that are known to us now, whether copied or dictated from
his original writings. Doubts have been raised as to whether
some of ShafiTs writings—such as the Kitab
were not
actually composed by a disciple.41 If some of his words have
been changed or rephrased, however, the contents of the books
must comprise ShafiTs own legal reasoning and ideas, for
ShafiTs biographers agree that his books were handed down
to us as recorded by his students and one of the students, who
wrote a Summary (Mukhtasar), agrees with Shafi'i’s funda­
mental opinions as recorded in his collected works.42
Shaft*! had difficulty persuading his opponents to accept his
opinions. He followed an independent line of legal reasoning,
often disagreeing with leading jurists, among them his great
master Malik. The disagreement aroused Malik! opponents,
who presented themselves to his circle to take issue with him,
but his great abilities as an attractive teacher and skillful
debater silenced them. One authority asserts that in an argu­
ment with Fityan, a Malik! follower in Egypt, Shaft*! triumphed,
but the intemperate loser, failing in persuasion, resorted to
abuse. The Governor, a patron of Shaft*!, ordered that Fityan

be punished by being paraded through the streets of the city
bearing a plank and stating that this was the penalty for
abusing a descendant of the Prophet’s near of kin. Enraged
by this degrading punishment, Fityan’s followers turned upon
Shaft'! after one of his lectures and resorted to violence. Shaft*!,
badly injured, was taken to his house, where he died a few
days later.43 The incident gives us a picture of the conse­
quences which heated controversies between rival schools of
thought could generate.
It is possible that ShafiTs death was not caused entirely by
his opponent’s attack. Shaft'! was known to suffer from a
serious intestinal illness which kept him frail and ailing during
the latter years of his life. He died on the last day of Rajab,
204 (20 January 820), in Fustat (Old C airo), and was buried
in the vault of the Banu *Abd al-Hakam, near Mount alMuqattam. The qubba (dome), still in existence, was built
by al-Malik al-Kamil, the Ayyubid Sultan, in 608/1212. It has
always been a prominent place of pilgrimage, and it was still
impressive and revered by many a Shafii admirer when visited
by the present writer in 1958.

ShafiTs Personality and Character
Tradition paints Shaft*! as a handsome man who paid atten­
tion to his appearance. When his hair turned grey in later
years, he was in the habit of dyeing it dark red. He was tall
and slender with an attractive face and a pleasing voice.44 'He
was a man of impressive personality, respected for his straight­
forwardness and revered for his piety. Although a man of
meager resources, gaining little remuneration from his study
of the law, he was generous with his friends as well as with
the poor. T hat generosity became the favorite theme of many

later biographers, who described him as giving away to the
poor everything that his hands had acquired.45 His will shows
his concern for the emancipation of his slave, as well as for
the welfare of all his relatives and associates.48
From early childhood Shafi'I seems to have displayed a sharp
intelligence and a good memory. We are told that at an early
age he had memorized a great deal of ancient Arab poetry,
in addition to the Qur’an and Malik’s al-Muwatta\ Eloquent
in speech and an expert in the Arabic language, his interest
in poetry and language preceded his interest in law. Only
when he was reminded, as one authority puts it, that it was
more dignified to become a jurist than a poet, did he turn to
the study of the law.47 Whether or not this story was invented
afterwards to account for ShafiTs legal pursuit, he did grow
up in a center where the legal profession tempted many a
Muslim scholar. He certainly chose a field in which he dis­
tinguished himself not only as a great thinker and a skillful
jurist, but as an expositor of the sharha without equal.
Although the study of law was ShafiTs main concern, his
early biographers state that he was acquainted with other
branches of Islamic learning. Later biographers tend to depict
him as a scholar whose knowledge was encyclopedic One of
these stories, related by al-Balawi, paints him as discussing
with Caliph Harun al-Rashid, in his first audience with that
caliph, almost every conceivable branch of knowledge, in­
cluding Greek medicine and philosophy in their original
language.48 T he early sources of his life give the impression
that he was opposed to theology and prohibited discourse on
it in his presence.48
Traditional accounts seem to give contradictory impressions

of ShafiTs loyalties. He is depicted as a man who gave secret
support to an *AIid pretender to the caliphate, but who, upon
appearing before Caliph Harun ai-Rashld, demonstrated that
his loyalty was to the ‘Abbasid rather than to the *Al!d house.80
When reproached afterward for betraying a certain sympathy
for the ‘Allds, Shaft*! did not deny it, on the ground that he
was a distant kinsman of theirs. Proof that he took an active
part in a conspiracy against the central authority appears
insufficient. At any rate, Shaft*! seems to have removed himself
completely from politics and palace intrigues and never again
accepted a position in the service of the state. His singlemindedness and straightforwardness prompted him to stay
above factional differences and personal jealousies.
Nor was he ready to compromise with the fellow members
of his profession. He did not shrink from showing disagree­
ment with the HanafI jurists in ‘Iraq, despite Shaybani’s inter­
cession with the caliph to secure his pardon, because ShafiTs
differences with IJanafi doctrines were genuine legal differ­
ences. When he lectured afterward in Madina, he showed just
as much legal disagreement with Malik! followers, although
he never ceased to pay high tribute to his great master Malik.
He betrayed, perhaps, a certain inflexibility in his relations
with rival schools because he maintained so high a standard
of legal reasoning that his disagreement with' others appeared
sharp and uncompromising. He was too much of a scholarly
perfectionist for his contemporaries.
Tradition also depicts him as a great debater who emerged
triumphant from every argument with his, rivals. Ibn *Abd
al-Hakam, one of his disciples in Egypt, pays high tribute to
the ability of his master in the art of defeating his critics.81
The Malik! jurist Fityan, it will be recalled, resorted to vio­
lence because his tongue failed him when he sought to chal­
lenge ShafiTs persuasive argument. Although Hanaf! jurists
reject ShafiTs ability to withstand a discussion with Shaybani,
early accounts state that Shaft*! conducted debates with HanafI

jurists with great skill.92 Both the Risdla and the Kitab alUmm bear witness to ShafiTs scholastic ability in pursuing an
argument to its logical conclusion. A great portion of the
Risdla is, in fact, written in the form of a debate between
Shafri and an interlocutor, who, in most cases, is a disguised
critic of ShafiTs doctrines.

t h e c o m p o s it io n a n d

STRUCTURE OF THE RISALA
C om position of th e Risdla
MOST AUTHORITIES are agreed that the Risdla was
written after Shaft! resided in 'Iraq.53 It was perhaps one of
his earliest works, although we are told that before he left
‘Iraq he had composed another book, entitled Kitab al-Iiujja,
and perhaps others, which have failed to reach us.54
Traditional accounts state that the Risdla was originally
written at the request of 'Abd al-Rahman b> M ahdl55 in order
to explain the legal significance of the Qur’an and the sunna.
While an invitation from a leading ‘Iraqi traditionist to
Shaft'!, who had made a reputation as the Upholder of Tradi­
tions, seems quite conceivable, the earliest extant sources on
ShafiTs life are silent on the point. Neither Ibn Abi Hatim
al-Raz! (d. 327/93S) nor Abu Nu'aym al-l$fahanl (d. 430/ 103S)
**Ibn Abi Hatim al-Raz!, p. 42.
‘
68 Few of them hold that the Risdla was written when Shaft*! was still
in Makka. See al-Khatvb al-Baghdadl, Vol. II. pp. 64-65; and Yaqut,
Mu'jam al-Udaba’, Vol. VI, pp. 388-89.

gives tlie slightest suggestion that the Risala was written at
Ibn Mahdfs request. Abu Nu'aym merely states that Ibn
Mahdi once remarked that al-Shafi'I was “ an intelligent young
man ” 56~-a statement which may mean that Ibn Mahdi had
read either the Risala or any one of ShafiTs other books and
concluded that he was an intelligent man; it does not neces­
sarily suggest that the Risala was written at Ibn Mahdfs
request.
Nor do the sources mention that Ibn Mahdi and Shafi'I ever
met. A tradition related by Shafi'f on the authority of Ibn
Mahdi, recorded in ©ne of his books,57 was sharply contra­
dicted by al-Sarraj al-Bulqini, on the ground that the two
men had not met; but al-Bulqlni accepted the traditional
story that the Risala was sent by Shafi'I to Ibn Mahdi. That
the two men may never have met does not weaken the possi­
bility that Ibn Mahdi had requested Shafi'I to write the
Risala; but it does raise doubts as to the reliability of later
reports that such a request had been made.
The first authority to state that Shafi'I composed the Risala
in response to Ibn Mahdfs request was BayhaqI. One of his
narratives, based on information transmitted by Musa, son of
‘Abd al-Rahman Ibn Mahdi, states that Musa’s father had
complained to Shafi'I that Malik’s legal opinions had been
distorted in Basra, and that Shafi'I responded by writing the
Risala to Ibn Mahdi. Musa, moreover, claims that he-had
seen the text of the Risala written in ShafiTs own hand.58
BayhaqI also reports a narrative, on the authority of al-fjarith
b. Surayj al-Naqqal, to the effect that al-Harith, who earned
the name of al-Naqqal (the carrier) because he carried the
Risala, had himself delivered the work to Ibn Mahdi.59 Later
authorities repeat virtually the same version of the story that
Ibn Mahdi had invited Shafi'I to write the Risala™

Perhaps Ibn Mahdl made known to Shaft*! his desire for a
book in support of the authoritative sources of the law and
against the prevailing tendency to use personal opinion. It
was unlikely that Shaft'! could produce a work as original as
the Risala virtually on the spur of the moment, the impression
given us by the sources. The theme of such a work must have
been in ShafiTs mind for a long time, and the book was either
ready when Ibn Mahd! asked for it, or it was simply a matter
of putting into writing what had already crystallized in ShafiTs
mind. A methodical legal reasoning, inferior in quality though
it may have been in the first version of the Risala, must have
been in preparation for a long while. It is even conceivable
that the narrative concerning Ibn Mahdl’s request may have
been circulated after he had seen or received the Risala from
Shaft'!- How Shaft*! conceived the idea of writing a book
dealing with the subject of usui (sources of the law) in a
completely novel manner is exceedingly difficult to determine.
But the age in which he lived and his involvement in the
controversy between two opposing schools of thought must
have given him the external stimulus to reflect on the subject.
His keen intellect and extensive knowledge of the law made
him eminently qualified to search fruitfully for the interrela­
tionship of the sources which separated rival schools of law.
But the structure and arguments of his reasoning must have
evolved in his mind after long study and reflection.

ShafiTs treatise on jurisprudence has become universally
known as Kitab al-Risala Ft Usui al-Fiqhy often abridged as
Kitab al-Risala or simply al-Risala. The word risala, which
means an epistle, or a communication in writing made to an
absent person, came to be used as a result of the traditional
story that this book had been sent in the form of an epistle to
‘Abd al-Rahman Ibn Mahdl, who had asked Shaft*! to write
a treatise on the authoritative sources of the shari'a. Thus the

22

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

book at first acquired the unofficial title of al-Risala, and this
later became the formal title in all the manuscripts that have
been preserved or published. Most of the writers who refer
to this treatise, whether in the original or the revised form,
call it Kitab al-Risala or al-Risala. Thus the Risdla has become
for all students of Islamic law the recognized title of ShafiTs
book or* jurisprudence.
Internal evidence shows that Shaft'! himself never called his
treatise by this name. More than half a dozen times, Shafi'i
refers to it either as “ Our Book,” " My Book,” “ this Book/'
or simply the “ Book.” 81 These references demonstrate that
the title of al-Risala became current after ShafiTs death and
that Shaft'! himself, if the name was current in his time, did
not recognize it as the proper title of his book.
The authorities are agreed that Shaft'! composed two treatises
on jurisprudence, both referred to as al-Risala; the old one
was composed in ‘Iraq and the new in Egypt.82 The old Risdla
is described as a book in which Shaft'! set forth a systematic
study of the Qur’an, including its general and particular rules
and its abrogating and abrogated communications, and of the
sunna as the authoritative sources of the law. Some authori­
ties state that it also dealt with ijma* (consensus) and qiyas
(analogy) .63 Since the text of the old Risdla has failed to
reach us, except perhaps for a few passages reproduced in
some later authorities,64 it is difficult to define precisely its
scope and arguments. We are told, however, by some authori­
ties who were acquainted with both versions that the new
Risdla was superior in quality to the old.65

It is likely that the old Risdla, dealing as it did with the

the new Risdla, which were regarded as two different works (Ibn Hajar’s

authoritative sources, must have been in the nature of an
apologia for the school of tradition, owing to Shafii’s pre­
occupation during his first residence in ‘Iraq with arguments
against Hanafi jurists. Although the old Risdla may have
dealt with ShafiTs opposition to personal opinion and the
free use of analogy, it is inconceivable that it dealt with ShafiTs
differences with Malik, as expounded in the new Risdla, since
in ‘Iraq Shaft*! had taken the position of a supporter of Malik!
doctrine against the criticism of fjanafi jurists. In the brief
quotation which Bayhaqi cites from the old Risdla, there is
evidence that Shafi1! clearly supported the position of the
blijazi traditionists, who held that the narratives of the
Prophet’s companions were authoritative, since they had been
in close association with the Prophet and understood the
meanings of his sunna. He also accepted the opinions of the
Successors, if there was agreement among them.**
The new Risdla, however, reflects the mature thinking ot
Shafi'! after he settled in Egypt, and as its substance and argu­
ments indicate, it deals with the whole subject of the sources
as they were reconstructed in his mind in his later years.
Internal evidence not only bears witness that the new Risdla
was composed in Egypt, since it contains cross references to
books which were written or dictated by Shafi*! after he settled
there,87 but it also demonstrates that in its present form the
new Risdla was written or revised toward the end of its author’s
life.68 Thus it reflects his mature legal speculations at the
height of his career as a leading jurist.
The new Risdla is a compact treatise composed in a style
which demonstrates that its author was an expert in the Arabic
language. However, his use of a new terminology and new
legal concepts often compelled him to repeat or redefine his
terms and arguments. This is specially noticeable in his dis­
course with an interlocutor who demands explanation or
repetition of ideas which Shafi*! may already have discussed
** Bayhaqi, folio 98.
“ See paragraph U84, below.
“ See paragraph 1173, below. Cf. Shtfi'I, Kitab al-Umm, Vol. VI, p. 77.

ISLA M IC JURISPRUDENCE

in other sections of the book. Moreover, the problem of proper
cross-referencing, which confronted other scholars, was not
always satisfactorily solved,88 and compelled Shafi*! at times to
repeat his ideas. Often he refers the reader to other sections
of the Risala without a precise indication as to which section
he means.70
However, the Risdla’s structure seems fairly sound *tnd logi­
cal, and ShafiTs arguments are set forth in a systematic manner
and carried to their logical conclusions. The author begins
his subject with a discussion of general topics in jurisprudence,
supported by detailed examples,and then takes up the au­
thoritative sources of the law. He pays particular attention
to the sunna and traditions, not only because of the com­
plexity of the subject, but also because he sought to establish
their overriding authority. Finally, he discusses rather briefly
the two other sources of the law, consensus and analogy, and
concludes with a critical evaluation of certain other methods
of reasoning such as istihsan (juristic preference) and ikhtilaf
(disagreement). From this logical order .the author makes
some three or lour digressions in which he discusses certain
topics which belong more appropriately to other sections of
the book.71
ShafiTs knowledge of ancient Arabic literature assisted his
literary style. In those days,no one could be a great scholar
unless he was a master of the Arabic tongue. He must also
have had the gift of lucid and eloquent expression and the
ability to quote freely from the Qur’an and from ancient
Arabic poetry. It is precisely these qualities of exactness and
eloquence which are characteristic of his style. He could,
moreover, arrest attention by a turn of expression, or a.fine
classical phrase, and he could sum up a.point of law tersely
in a maxim. Though he had all these gifts, ShafiTs style is
at times discursive and, in the Risala in particular, too com<,nCf. F. Rosenthal, The Technique and Approach of Muslim Scholar­

pact for clarity and, not infrequently, obscure. In comparison
with other jurists, however, his style rises to eloquence.

The Order and Sources of the Risala
Since the structure and substance of the old Risala are not
known to us, it is extremely difficult to state precisely to what
degree the text of the new Risala was based on the old. Both
internal evidence and the narratives of the authorities seem
to indicate that/ShafH had, perhaps, composed the second
Risala anew. Once asked about ShafiTs books, Ibn Hanbal
replied: “ The books Shafi'i wrote in ‘Iraq were far from
perfect; after settling in Egypt, they were rewritten and per­
fected.” 72 Bayhaqi, as well as other authorities, endorse the
idea that the Risala was rewritten in Egypt, and they give the
impression that the old and the new editions were two dif­
ferent books.73 Internal evidence suggests that not all of
ShafiTs earlier works were at his disposal after he settled in
Egypt. In Chapter X of the new JRisala, Shafi'i states that the
transmitters of some of the traditions that he cited were
omitted because not all his earlier books were with him.74 In
his Kitab Ikhtilaf ahHadith Shafi'i again apologizes for the
fact that he did not have the firstCversion of the book.75 These
statements indicate that some of the works Shaft5! composed in
'Iraq, perhaps including the old Risala, were no longer availa­
ble to him alter he settled in Egypt.
Finally, we may raise the question of the sources from which
Shafi'i drew inspiration and information. This is not an easy
question to answer specifically, since Shafi'i makes no reference
in the Risala to books which he may have consulted. In his
other works, the Kitab al-Umm in particular, he devotes whole
7a Ibn Abl Hatim al-Razi, p. 60.

sections to discussions with other jurists—such as Awza'i, Malik,
Abu Hanifa, Abu Yusuf and Shaybani—which clearly indicate
that he had studied the works of these eminent jurists with
care.™ His biographers give the impression that Shafii was
acquainted with almost all scholarly works.”
Traditional accounts portray Shafi'i as taking an early in­
terest in learning. He committed the Qur’an to heart at seven
and Malik’s Muwatta’ at ten. These two books undoubtedly
left a great impression on his mind and supplied indispensa­
ble sources for his legal training and speculation. The Qur’an
served the double purpose of supplying raw material for legis­
lation, as the basic source of law, and an inspiring ideal for
the scholar who aimed at shaping his system of law in harmony
with that model. There are 220 Quranic citations in the
Risala, given either as specific rules of law or as examples for
formulating principles or maxims of law.
Next to the Qur’an, Shafi'i stressed the Prophet’s sunna. We
are told that the old Risala was written mainly to defend the
viewpoint of traditionists concerning the overriding authority
of the sunna. In the new Risalac not only does Shafi'i study
the sunna as a source of law, but he also draws heavily on it
in formulating his rules and maxims of law. Over a hundred
traditions are cited in the Risala, several of them repeated as
examples at various points. Most of these traditions, it seems,
Shafi’i related on the authority of the masters under whom he
studied in Makka and Madina. His two greatest authorities
are, of course, Malik, from whom he quotes thirty-eight tradi­
tions,78 and Sufyan b. 'Uyayna, from whom he quotes thirtyfive traditions.10 From his other masters, he cites six traditions
from 'Abd ai-'Aziz al Darawardi (Madina) ,80 four from Ibn
Shafi'i, Kitab al-Um, Vol. VII, pp. 87 if., 177 ff., 277 ff., 303 if.

whom he refers as the “ trustworthy authority ” without men­
tioning his name,80 and from ‘Iraq he relates three traditions
on the authority of ‘Abd al-Wahhab b. *Abd al-Majid alThaqafl.87 A few other traditions either are related without
authority or are cited with an incomplete list of authorities.
From the viewpoint of legal speculation we are inclined to
believe that Shafi'Fs main inspiration was derived from the
intense debate with Hanafi jurists in ‘Iraq to which he had
been subjected. He riot only had to study their works, Shaybanl’s in particular, which he copied, but also to reflect on
the underlying principles separating him from those jurists.
His arguments with the Hanafi jurists must have had greater
influence on his legal speculation than his biographers indi­
cate. After settling in Egypt, Shafi‘1 acknowledged his in­
debtedness to the Hanafi jurists and paid high tribute to the
contributions of Abu Hanlfa and ShaybanI to the sharl*a.88
Much of his legal material and many of his ideas Shafi‘i
owed to the teachings of his masters, which he stored in his
memory. His debates with his rival scholars and his discus­
sions of legal questions with colleagues and disciples must
have contributed greatly to his knowledge and to the final
formulation of his opinions. To be specific on these matters
is difficult, however, for even if a disciple did contribute his
share in a discussion, it was customary for the disciple to
record the account in his notes on the authority of his master.

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

SUBSTANCE AND ARGUMENT
OF THE RISALA
The Vocabulary of the Risala
TH E VOCABULARY of the Risala raises questions
not only of legal nomenclature, blit also of literary and philo­
sophical terminology. Shafi'i rarely defines his terms, assuming
that his followers and readers will be familiar with the general
and technical words from the context of his writings or from
the common usage of the time. Thus before we proceed to
the fundamental ideas embodied in the Risala, it may be
useful to discuss briefly the meaning of some of its cardinal
terms and expressions. Four sets of terms deserve particular
examination.
In the first set, there are general terms which need elucida­
tion, such as ‘ilm (knowledge), al-bayan (declaration), and
'adl (justice). By ‘ilm, Shafi'i always means legal knowledge
derived from the authoritative sources of the law; some rules
are obligatory for men individually (far<J *ayn), such as
prayer and fasting, and some are obligatory for them collec­
tively, such as the jihad. He equates knowledge with certainty
and states that it is the duty of the jurist to seek the truth in
his legal reasoning.89 By al-bayan, which Shafi'i applies to
Quranic communications, he means a clear declaration em­
bodying a rule or a principle of law. The term is frequently
used in the Risala either in the sense of mere declaration,
embodying a rule of law, or in clarifying the meaning of a
certain rule of law.
The term ‘adl fs. used either in the general sense of justice,
which implies conformity with the law, or as the necessary
qualification for a witness. Although no precise definition is
••See Chap. Ill, below; cf. Sharif *AU al-Jurjanl, Kitab al-Ta'rif&t, ed.
G. L. Fliigel (Leipzig, 1845), pp. 160-62.

given by Shaft’!, the term ‘adala, the quality of *adl, is described
by al-Mawardl, a Shaft'! jurist, as a state of moral and religious
perfection.90 Thus the term 'adl signifies probity or justness
of character. This is the sense in which it is frequently used
in the Risala. The witness must be *adl (just in character),
and the minimum requirement is that he must display just­
ness at the time when his testimony is given. It is possible,
Shaft'! argues, that the witness may not be 'adl at another
time. The testimony of one witness of just character must be
supported by another witness of just character, and the just­
ness of character of each witness must be confirmed by another
person of just character.81
The second set of terms is made up of those which Shaft*!
uses in his discussions of the Qur’an. The terms “ general”
and “ particular ” as applied to rules, which are familiar to
modern students of the law, were introduced to Islamic juris­
prudence for the first time by Shaft*!.92 The precise meaning
of these terms will be explained in the following section. He
also introduced the terms “ explicit ” and “ implicit,” the first
being equivalent to the literal meaning of the communication
and the second to the meaning implied either in the text or
in the context of the communication. Shaft*! also uses the
term al-naskh or the abrogation of divine legislation, which
is well known to contemporary jurists as the repeal of .legis­
lation. The term as well as the principle of abrogation are
to be found in the Qur’an (Q. XVI, 103), but Shaft*! argues
that a Quranic communication can be abrogated only by
another Quranic communication and that neither does the
Qur’an abrogate the sunna, nor the sunna the Quran. It is
true, he goes on to argue, that a sunna can be superseded by
80 al-Mawardi, Kitab al-Ahkam al-Sultaniya, ed. M. Enger (Bonn, 1853),
p. 108; and paragraph 16, below.
81 See paragraphs 364-367, below.
** Ibn Abi Hatim al-Razi, p. 57. Ibn Hanbal is reported to-have said
that he had not understood the rules of the Qur'an until he heard ShafiTs
classification of these rules into general and particular, etc. See Abu
Nu'aym, p. 97.

a Quranic communication, but not until the sunna is first,
abrogated by another sunna laid down by the Prophet.93
In the third set of terms, there are certain words used in
connection with ShafiTs discussion of the sunna and hadlth
' (tradition). Although sunna and hadlth mean the same thing
in practice, in pre-lslaraic Arabia sunna meant usage or
custom and it formed the common law observed by the Arabs.
After the rise of Islam, the term sunna was applied to the
sayings and decisions o£ the Prophet Muhammad, and hadlth
meant the communication of the sunna, or the Prophet’s
custom. In the words of Wensinck, " hadlth is the external,
sunna the internal side of tradition; hadlth is the form, sunna
the matter.” The sunna is reported in the form of a general
statement—usually short-preceded by a chain of authorities
or transmitters (isnad), cited to prove the authenticity of the
report. The isnad begins with the latest authority and goes
back to a Companion who relates the Prophet’s custom (i. e.,
his saying or decision). This transmission must be uninter­
rupted and must be made on the authority of an eye or ear
witness, and all the transmitters must be thoroughly reliable.
Thus, the criticism of Muslim scholars was restricted to a
thorough examination of the isnad (transmission), and the
scholars were satisfied if the tradition passed such an external
test.
The traditions were collected in the third century (ninth
century of the Christian era) in a number of digests, and six
digests became recognized as authoritative. These are the two
$afiihs of al-Bukharl (d. 256/869) and Muslim (d. 261/874),
and the four sunans of Abu Dawud (d. 275/888), Tirmidhl
(d. 279/892), Ibn Maja <d. 283/886), and al-Nasa'I (d,
303/915) . Other digests of traditions, well known to students

of the shari'a, are by Ibn Hanbal (d. 241/856), al-Dariml
(d. 255/869), al-Daraqupii (d. 385/996), al-Bayhaql (d. 458/
1065), and others. Although Shaft'! is critical of narratives
transmitted by unreliable authorities, and is unwilling to
accept traditions from authorities unknown to him, he him­
self cites in the Risala several traditions without isnad.95 Such
traditions are known to traditionists as mursal, or traditions
lacking some or all the names of the transmitters. Shaft'! also
accepts some traditions that were transmitted by a single
authority. Such traditions are called al-khabar al-wahid, or
the single-individual tradition.9®
In' the fourth set of terms, words such as ijtihad, qiyas,
ijma', and istihsan are used in the exercise of legal reasoning.
Literally, ijtihad means the exercise of effort. Originally it
was used as the exercise of discretion and personal opinion,
but in ShafiTs time the term was narrowed down to mean
the discretion of the scholar. Shaft'! limited ijtihad to the
use of qiyas (analogy), prohibiting the exercise of personal
opinion unless it were based on a precedent. Ijtihad, Shaft'!
says, is the method of reasoning, based on certain indications,
leading to the correct decision.97 Qiyas is a variety of ijtihad
of which Shaft*! approves, provided there is a relevant text in
the Qur’an or tradition on the strength of which analogy
could be applied. It is generally defined as the method of
legal reasoning by which a decision is made on the strength
of:a precedent in which a common reason, or an effective
cause, is applicable.98 ShafiTs conception of analogy perhaps
may be best seen in the following statement;
Analogy is of various kinds. . . . They differ from one another
in the antecedence of the analogy of either one of the twt>, or its

By ijma' (consensus) Shafi'I does not mean merely the agree­
ment of a .few scholars of a certain town or locality, as the
IJijazI and 'Iraqi jurists seem to have held, but the majority
of leading jurists in Muslim lands. He also universalized ijma‘
on matters of fundamentals to include agreement of the
Muslim community.100 On matters of fundamentals arrived
at by consensus, Shafi'I argues, there should be no disagree­
ment (ikhtilaf) , but on matters of detail for which there may
be two answers, one answer might be chosen by istihsan (dis­
cretion or preference). The earlier jurists seem to have per­
mitted a greater degree of discretion than Shafi'I was inclined
to accept.101

justice to it, for only a complete translation of the text, such
as is provided in the following pages, can present a full expres­
sion of the ideas and the method of reasoning of its author.
However, a description of the Risala, its fundamental ideas
and problems, may serve the reader as a guide.

ligious basis of Islamic jurisprudence. After the usual homage
and expressions of gratitude to God, Shaft4! points out that
at the time Muhammad was charged with his prophetic mis­
sion, mankind was divided into two classes. There were those
who did not believe in God and who worshipped idols and
stones and other natural objects, and there were the “ People
of the Book,” 102 who believed in God and in the teachings
of His earlier prophets, but who had changed God's com­
mands and forged falsehood by their tongues, mixing it with
the truth that God had revealed to them. Because of this
state of misbelief, God decided to send forth the last of his
prophets, Muhammad, to repair and reconstruct the world
into a God-fearing community. Thus Muhammad’s mission,
embodied in the term “ Islam,” was to .provide mankind with
the final and definitive religion.
Shafi'I discusses briefly the place of the Qur’an in the Islamic
religion and the duty of the Muslims to obey the orders of
Muhammad, and concludes that it is the duty of all those who.
seek legal knowledge to gain it by constant appeal'to God’s
Book as communicated to the Prophet. For “ no misfortune
wil1 ever descend upon any of the followers of God’s religion
for which there is no guidance in the Book of God to indicate
the right way.” 103
The Qur’an, Shafi'I points out, is the basis of legal knowledge.
Its provisions constitute a “ perspicuous declaration ” (Q. Ill,
132) on all matters, spiritual and temporal, which men are
under obligation to observe. The second chapter of the Risdla
is therefore devoted to a discussion of the nature of the legal
- provisions of the Qur’an under the title “ al-bayan ” (per­
spicuous declaration). “Al-bayan," Shaft*! says, " is a collec­
tive term ” which includes general principles of law as well
as detailed rules. The term al-bayan has been discussed by
,0* Ahl al-Kitab, the people who possess a scripture, include Christians,
Jews, Magians (Zoroastrians), Samaritans, and' Sabians. For a discussion
of their status in Islam, see my War and Peace in the Law of Islam,
Chap. 17.

several leading jurists. Some say that it merely means a declara­
tion, embodying certain legal provisions; others argue that it
not only declares them, but also makes them clear.104 Shafi‘1,
however, seems to emphasize the legal content of the pro­
visions on the grounds that all Quranic communications are
clear, “ although some are more sharply clarified than others,”
and only to those who are ignorant of the Arab tongue do
some communications seem less clear than others. He then
divides al-bayan into five categories. The first consists of a
specific legal provision in the text of the Qur’an, such as the
basic duties that are owed to God (credal witness, prayer,
payment of alms, fasting, and pilgrimage). The second in­
cludes certain provisions, whose modes of observance are
specified by an order of the Prophet Muhammad (such as the
number of prayers each day and the amount of alms to be
paid). T he third consists of broad legal provisions which
Muhammad particularized. T he fourth includes all the legal
provisions laid down by Muhammad in the absence of a specific
Quranic text. The fifth and final category is comprised of
rules which are sought by the exercise of ijtihad (personal
reasoning) by means of qiyas (analogy).
Although in his chapter on al-bayan Shafi‘1 discusses certain
characteristics of the Qur'an, that chapter is, apparently, in­
tended to be only an introduction to a fuller treatment of the
Qur’an, from a juridical viewpoint, in subsequent chapters.
At the end of chapter II, on al-bayan, he discusses the Arabic
eloquence of the Qur’an—one of its distinguishing features—
which, to the Muslims, is the chief evidence of the miracle
(i‘ja 2) of this Book.105

ShafiTs critical study of the Qur'an from a juridical view­
point led him to the keen observation that the Quranic rules
and principles fall into various categories. To begin with, he
divides them into general and particular rules. Some of the
general rules, he observes, are intended to be general, in which
the particular rules are included. There are general rules in
which both the general and particular rules are included, and
there are general rules which are intended to be particular
rules.
Then Shafi'I divides the Quranic legislation into a different^
set of categories. There are, he observes, general rules the
meaning of which may be clarified by the context, and there
are those only the wording of which indicates the implicit
meaning. There are general rules, he adds, which only the
sunna can specify as general or particular.
ShafiTs classification of the Quranic legislation into the
foregoing categories was not only novel but was hailed as a
great contribution to the understanding of the Qur’an as a
source of law. His distinction between the general, which
embodies general rules and principles of law, and the particu­
lar, which means specific rules, clarified for his contemporaries
the way toward a deeper understanding of the sources and
principles of Islamic law. ShafiTs contribution elicited high
praise. To cite but one example, al-Karabls! told Ahmad b.
ftanbal—founder of another school of law—that he had under­
stood the precise meaning of the Qur’an only after he had
read the Risala.106
ShafiTs specific reference to the sunna, the Prophet’s sayings
and decisions, to clarify the meaning of a particular piece of
Quranic legislation or an ambiguous text, brings the sunna
into the field of Islamic legislation and indicates its specific
role as a source of law. It is in his discussions of the sunna
and traditions that we find one of ShafiTs greatest contribu­
tions to Islamic jurisprudence. For although the school of
tradition laid sufficient emphasis on the sunna, in opposition
to the school of opinion, in which Shafi'i himself took an active
10* Ibn Abl I^atim al-Razi, p. 57; al-Fakhr al-R&zi, p. 20.

36

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

part in- his early career, it was Shafi’I who made it clear that
only an authentic tradition from the Prophet is binding and
constitutes an authoritative source of legislation. Both the
HijazI and the Iraqi jurists often accepted traditions that were
based on local custom or embodied a personal opinion as valid
for legislation. Shafi’I made a distinction between an authentic
tradition from the Prophet and a narrative which embodies
the opinion of a Companion or a leading jurist; the latter may
be useful in clarifying the meaning of a text, but it should not
be as binding as a tradition from the Prophet.
Shafi'I goes on, in the following chapters, to discuss the
principle of abrogation, by virtue of which a Quranic com­
munication was repealed by a later one. Here he indicates
again the role of the sunna in its relation to the Qur’an,
pointing out that the sunna*merely states which of the Quranic
communications are the abrogating ones and which are the
abrogated, but he rejects the Hanaft doctrine which states that
the sunna can •'abrogate the- Q ur’an. The Qur’an does not
abrogate the sunna directly nor does the sunna abrogate the
Qur’an; the Prophet, says Shafi'I, always provided a new sunna,
in conformity with Quranic legislation, when the Quranic
legislation contradicted an earlier sunna. Thus although he
stresses the significance of the sunna, he gives it a precise
definition as a second, authoritative source of law in its relation
to the Qur’an.
The sunna includes Muhammad’s sayings and decisions. It
is, therefore, not on the same level as the infallible Quranic
communications. However, Shaft’! argues, God had imposed
on men the duty of obedience to His Prophet as well as to
Him, and he goes on to give evidence that God regards dis­
obedience to the Prophet as disobedience to Him. Accordingly,
in practice the sunna of the Prophet is a source of legislation
as valid as the Qur’an.
But since Shafi’I emphasizes the rule that only an authentic
sunna, transmitted by reliable authorities, constitutes a valid
source of law, he devotes a- large portion of the Risala to a
study of what constitutes an authentic tradition, who are the

t r a n s l a t o r ’s i n t r o d u c t i o n

S7

reliable transmitters, and why certain authentic traditions are
contradictory to one another. This latter category, to which
he pays attention, is as novel as his distinction in the Quranic
legislation between the general and particular.
To Shafi'i there are no contradictory traditions. They appear
contradictory only to those who do not know the circumstances
in which they were laid down and who do not realize that
certain traditions merely qualify others. ShafiTs contribution
to this field of legal reasoning, although it may raise certain ,
doubts as to the historical evidence of his interpretation, re­
solved a serious problem for the jurists who were faced with
a great mass of contradictory traditions. ShafiTs method of
reconciliation, called al-ta’wil (interpretation) ,107, encouraged
the acceptance of many a tradition which otherwise would
have been in danger of being rejected. Thus his solution sup­
plied further material for legal development, but for the
critical historian it rendered more difficult the problem of
separating the historical elements from the mass of traditions
which Muslim publicists accepted without question.
The latter part of the Risala deals briefly with ijma' (con­
sensus) , qiyas (analogy), ijtihad (personal reasoning), istihsan
(juristic preference), and ikhtilaf (disagreement). Although
these are important jurisprudential subjects, Shafi'i devotes
much less space to them than-to the Qur’an and sunna.
ShafiTs doctrine of consensus, as Schacht rightly points out,
develops continuously in his writings.108 It begins as the con­
sensus of a few scholars in a certain locality, following Malik’s
method,109 and becomes a concept that includes the entire
Muslim community. If the view that the new Risala was
written or revised as the last of ShafiTs writings is correct, his
doctrine of consensus as defined in this work should represent
his final formulation. In various parts of the Risala, Shafi'i
107 T a’wll became the subject of further study by many Muslim scholars.

ISLAM IC JU RISPRU D EN CE

refers to the consensus of the scholars as a method of ex­
pounding the law acceptable to contemporary jurists, but in
his references to the consensus of the community at large,
specially in the chapter on consensus,110 he undoubtedly tends
to invest it with higher authority. Shafi'i ends his chapter on
consensus by asserting: " He who holds what the Muslim com­
munity holds shall be regarded as following the community,
and he who holds differently shall be regarded as opposing the
community he was ordered to follow. So the error comes from
separation. . . .”
The concept vox populi, vox Dei, embodied in a tradition
which states “ My people will never agree on an error," is not
cited by Shafi'i in this form, a fact which perhaps indicates
that it was circulated after his time. But the concept does
appear in the Risdla, which may well be the source of the
final formulation of the principle embodied in the tradition
ascribed to the Prophet Muhammad.111 ShafiTs doctrine of
the community at large was opposed by other scholars, in­
cluding his own followers, although Ghazzalf (d. I l l 1) tried
to confine the agreement to fundamental principles, leaving
matters of detail to the consensus of the scholars.112 The
fundamental weakness in the doctrine of the consensus of the
community was procedural—the lack of an adequate method
which would provide means for the community to arrive at
an agreement.113
Shafi'i discusses ijtihad (personal reasoning) and qiyas
(analogy) at greater length than consensus, because he tried
to limit the use of personal reasoning, in the wide and unre­
stricted sense, to the use of analogy. He often uses the terms
110 See Chap. XI, below.
111 Goldziher has suggested a possible Roman influence on the Islamic
doctrine of consensus, but a primitive form of consensus was not new to
the Arabs. See J. Schacht, Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence, pp.
83, 91.
111 Ghazzall, al-Mustasfa, Vol. I, p. 115.
11#T he lack of a method by which to arrive at an agreement remained
the perennial weakness of the doctrine of consensus, and no adequate
-solution was provided by jurists who came after Shafi'i. See remarks on
this point in my War and Peace in the Law of Islam, pp. 33-34.

qiyas and ijtih£d interchangeably, but obviously he permits
personal reasoning only through analogy. " Analogy is of two
kinds," says Shafi'i, “ the first, if the case in question is similar
to the original meaning [of the precedent]. . . . The second,
if the case in question is similar to several precedents, analogy
must be applied to the precedent nearest in resemblance and
most appropriate." 114 He tried,>however, to limit the use of
analogy to matters of detail; it cannot supersede an authorita­
tive text. Neither should it be based on a special or an ex­
ceptional precedent; analogy must conform to the spirit and
the general rules and principles of the law. In taking such a
position Shafi'i established a balance between those who used
analogy extensively as a source of law and those who rejected
it altogether. As to istihsan, which the 'Iraqi jurists used as a
method for rejecting one precedent in favor of another, it is
declared unacceptable by Shafi'i because it permits virtually
unlimited use of discretion and personal^easoning. Only one
form of personal reasoning is acceptable to Shafi'i—analogy.
Even this method is regarded as a weak instrument. In sum­
ming up the sources of the law at the end of the Risala, Shafi'i
says: MAlthough I have made decisions [on the basis of con­
sensus and analogy] just as I have made decisions on the basis
of the Book and the sunna, [in the case of consensus and
analogy] the principle on which I made my decision varies.” 115
Finally, the Risala ends with a discussion of ikhtilaf (dis­
agreement) . Although the jurists before Shafi'i seem to have
tolerated a greater freedom in the use of disagreement, the
trend toward the sytematic use of the sources as defined by
Shafi'i set in motion the movement to limit disagreement.
Shafi'i states that there are two kinds of disagreement. The
one is prohibited and the other permitted. He goes on to say:
O n all m atters concerning which God provided clear textual evi­
dence in His Book o r [a sunna] uttered by the P ro p h et's tongue,
disagreement am ong those to whom these [texts] are know n is
y
fi.
114 See paragraph 497, below.

unlaw ful. As to m atters th a t are liable to different in te rp re ta­
tions or derived from analogy, so th a t he who interprets o r applies ,
analogy arrives at a decision different from th a t arrived a t by
another, I d o n o t hold th a t [disagreem ent] of this k in d constitutes
such strictness as th at arising from tex tu al [evidence].**8

Thus Shaft*! restricts disagreement only on matters on which
the scholars may exercise personal reasoning (ijtihad) and on
which each may take a decision which is right in his own way.
A case in point is the search for the qibla, the direction of
the Sacred Mosque. Everyone will have to determine his own
qibla, by ijtihad, and although each may take a slightly dif­
ferent position from another, everyone is right in his own way.

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE RISALA
Shafi'i as the Founder of the Science of Islamic Juris­
prudence
TH E RISALA, a novel work in the literature of Islamic
law, gave Shaft*! a name as the founder oL*he science of u$ul
ahfiqh (roots or sources of the law) . T he u$ul had been the
subject of study by other jurists as attested by the fact that
Abu Yusuf (d. 182/798) discusses certain aspects of it in his
Kitab al-Khardj,n1 and Shaybam, one of Shafi'fs early friends
in 'Iraq, is reputed to have written a book on u$ul. But this
term had not yet acquired the technical meaning of a science
dealing specifically with the sources of the law which Shaft*!
had attached to it. No other jurist seems to have discussed
the subject in so coherent and systematic a manner, and the

Risdla appears to be the first complete and well-organized
survey of the u§£xl, their interrelationship, and how the detailed
rules and decisions were derived from the authoritative sources.
It proved to be so excellent a guide of the shari'a that it was
always referred to as the leading work on the subject.118 Some
of the subjects of this book, such as istihsan (juristic prefer­
ence) and 'ilm (legal knowledge), are dealt with more fully
in the Kitdb alU m m ,119 and a separate work is devoted to the
study of the Qur’a n ;120 but the Risdla is the only compre­
hensive treatise dealing with the subject of u$ul which Shafi'I
had written.
The Risdla, however, is not a complete work on jurispru­
dence dealing with the nature and principles of law, although
the reader may well form an idea about Shafi'i's conception
of the nature of law since several sections are devoted to an
exposition of the broad principles and rules of the shari*a.
The Risdla is in the main a treatise on the nature and use of
the sources of the shari'a. It was written originally as an
apologia for the supremacy of traditions, but after its funda­
mental ideas and arguments had been reformulated in Egypt#
it represented a systematic and critical study of all the sources
of the law.
The significance of the Risdla, therefore, lies not so much
in the detailed matters it discusses, although these have had
their influences on Muslim jurists, as in the comprehensive
view of the whole subject of u§ul and in the logical and sys­
tematic method Shaft'! provided for legal reasoning. The
originality of the book lies in its new departure in the study
of jurisprudence.
From ShafiTs time onward, the Risdla became a textbook
for students of Muslim jurisprudence. It has been carefully

studied by ShafiTs followers as well as by the followers of
other schools of law. Al-Muzanl, one of ShafiTs disciples, said
that he had read the Risala five hundred times; from each
reading he had derived a fresh thought.121 Ibn fjanbal often
suggested the Risala to his followers and ranked it in his mind
among the best of ShafiTs writings. It became a model for
both jurists and theologians who wrote on the subject. AlGhazzali, perhaps the greatest Muslim theologian, wrote a
work on jurisprudence in which he elaborated the theme of
the Risala and set forth a study of the sources of law in a
highly logical and systematic manner in accordance with the
Shafi'i school of law.122
The Risala became a favorite subject for commentaries
written by later jurists. Although none of the commentaries
has been found, we are told by some authorities that at least
five were composed. One of them was by Abu Bakr al-§ayrafi
(d. 330/932), who was hailed by al-Subki, a Shafi'i follower,
as the greatest writer on jurisprudence since Shafi'i himself.
Other commentators were ai-Naysaburi (d. 349/960), al-Shashi
(d. 365/976), al-Jawzaqi (d. 378/989), and al-Juwayni (d.
438/1046). These commentators were all learned in the law
and theology, and their books were highly regarded in Islamic
lands.123

The Islamization and Idealization of Lazo
By providing a precise method of legal reasoning, Shafi'i
achieved two important results. First, he rationalized on an
Islamic basis all the law that earlier generations had handed
down. Not only did he reject the use of sources that were not

Islamic, such as custom and personal opinion, but he also
defined the method by which legal reasoning was restricted
within the framework of the authoritative sources. Although
historically the law was derived from both Islamic and nonIslamic sources, the process of Islamizing the law was perhaps
an unconscious movement set in motion from the very begin­
ning of Islam. It was Shafi'I, however, who consciously laid
down a method of jurisprudence that was intended to confine
legal reasoning within the framework of Islamic sources. To
achieve the purpose he inevitably narrowed the free use of
legal reasoning, and the tendency toward taqlid (literally,
imitation, i. e., to follow the doctrine of a recognized authority)
may be said to have begun at that time. In the following
century, taqlid became the dominating rule.
Furthermore, ShafiTs logical method led him to assume
that the decisions and actions of the Prophet had always been
consistent and rational. In making use of the Prophet’s sunna
as a source of law, he always assumed that there was no contra­
dictory sunna; if one was ever found, either it must be lacking
in authenticity or, Shaft1! argued, the circumstances in which
the contradictory sunna had been provided were not the same.
In following this line of reasoning, Shaft'! subordinated posi­
tive rules to the sunna and rejected old legal doctrines, even
though based on sound legal reasoning, whenever they contra­
dicted the authority of the sunna.
ShafiTs method of jurisprudence was concerned less with
developing the law that existed in his age than with systema­
tizing a body of law that had already reached a high degree of
growth. Thus in the Risala Shafii paid less attention to the
problem of developing new principles of law than to the
problem of how to demonstrate that all the principles and
rules that existed in His time were derived from recognized
Islamic sources.
Closely associated with the Islamization of law, perhaps the
inevitable result of it, was the tendency to idealize the sHarl'a
as the perfect legal order. It is true that Quranic legislation
was regarded as divine from the very beginning, but pre-

44

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

Islamic law, customary or otherwise, that was not repealed by
divine legislation was incorporated into Islam after a long
process o£ synthesis. All the early Muslim jurists unconsciously
contributed to the harmonizing of the law with the spirit of
divine legislation by making decisions in the form of answers
to practical questions. Thus the idea of regarding as divine
not only Quranic legislation, but all Islamic law, may be said
to have begun in early Islamic history. The philosophical
elaboration of this idea, however, had not yet been fully
achieved until ShafiTs time. One of ShafiTs main preoccupa­
tions, it will be recalled, was his constant disputations with
fellow jurists against the use of sources which might infuse
into the law elements of human legislation. The development
of the shari'a after ShafiTs time tended to become gradually
divorced from the practical needs of the individual and
oriented toward the common interests of Islam, embodying its
ethical and religious ideals.
Not unlike the idea of natural law in medieval Christendom,
Islamic law was regarded as transcendental and perfect. In
contrast with positive law, Islamic law was revealed in a super­
natural way and for a supermundane purpose. The jus
divinum was regarded as the ideal, eternal and just, designed
for all time and characterized by its universal application to
all men.124 The ideal life was the life led in strictest con­
formity with this law.
In theory the divine law preceded the state and was inde­
pendent of man's own existence. The state was created to
enforce the law, but if it fails to do so—and in such a case
the state forfeits its raison d'etre—the individual still remains
under an obligation to observe the law even in the absence of
anyone to enforce it. The sanction of the law, which is dis­
tinct from the validity of that law, need not exist. For the
object of the law is to provide for the individual the right path
(sharTa), or the ideal life, regardless of the existence of the
proper authority to enforce it.125

45

The need fot\a rational justification of such a system is so
great that man often seeks to justify it by mere self-conviction.12*
ShafiTs legal reasoning supplied a rationale for the Islamic
legal order. Deriving his system from the Qur’an, the very
■word of God, and from the model conduct set forth by God’s
Prophet, Shaft'! demonstrated how every rule of law can con­
form in letter or in spirit to the norms provided by the au­
thoritative sources. In the final formulation of the classical
system of Islamic law ShafiTs impress remained permanent.

ShafiTs Influence
It is not difficult to understand the reason for ShafiTs
pre-eminence. His vast capacity for work, his extraordinary
knowledge of the law as well as his broad knowledge of Islamic
studies, his powerful intellect and his eloquent and lucid ex­
position were devoted exclusively to the study of law. No less
favorable for his great success were the circumstances in which
he played his role as the founder of a new school of law. He
appeared at a time when two rival schools of law were com­
peting for supremacy. There is a saying related by a Muslim
scholar that the reason ShafiTs life was relatively short was
that there was still need for some differences of opinion, and
had (he lived longer, no differences would have survived.127
Shaft'! probably never intended to found a school of law after
his name. His biographers often quote him as saying that he
merely wished to teach the truth and had no desire to
have his name cited as an authority.128 ShafiTs precise legal
methodology, however, inevitably limited the number of schools

of law that were developing and led to the establishment of
a separate school of law.
After ShafiTs death, many legends surrounded the story of
his life and his iufluence. A tradition from the Prophet has
it that at the end of every century a great reformer from his
house would appear. It has been held that ’Umar b. *Abd al*AzIz (d. 101 /720), the eighth Umayyad caliph, was the re­
ligious reformer who appeared at the end of the first century
of the Islamic era; at the end of the second, it was Shafi'i.
Other traditions have been related to prove that ShafiTs legal
doctrine was anticipated and approved by the Prophet.128
Later accounts of his life abound with similar stories which
raised him to the highest saintly position. Although these
stories lack historical foundation, they should not be dismissed
as without value, because for centuries they influenced the
minds of generations that followed.
Yet ShafiTs role as the founder of a new school of law was
not the product of a hero cult arising after .his death, as in
the case of Ibn Hanbal; nor was he, like Abu Hanifa, the
titular head of a group of distinguished jurists who all con­
tributed to Hanafi law. His was the active career of a jurist
who provided the foundation of a new school" of law. ShafiTs
influence as the founder of a school of law began after he
settled in Egypt, and it rose steadily. Among the leading dis­
ciples who were already active in spreading his earlier doc­
trines in 'Iraq were men such as Abu *Ubayd al-Qasim b.

lowed by Abu Bakr al-Hamidl (d. 219/835),135 Abu Ishaq
al-Shafii {d. 237/852) ,136 and others.187 In Egypt his leading
disciples were al-Buwayti (d. 231/845) ,138 al-Muzanl (d. 264/

b. Sulayman al-Muradl (d. 270/833) ,141 and others.142 These
jurists not only recorded ShafiTs words and expounded his
legal doctrines, but they also spread his teachings to other
countries and bequeathed his collected writings to succeeding
generations.
Cairo and Baghdad, and to a lesser degree Makka, were the
chief centers from which ShafiTs doctrines first radiated.
Within a century after his death, the Shafi'I school gradually
spread into Madina, Syria, and Central Asia. Shrinking in
Egypt under Futimid rule (909/1171), it again became pre­
dominant under $alah al-DIn (d. 564/1169). In the last cen­
turies before the occupation of the central lands of Islam by
the Ottoman sultans, the Shafii school had become the most
widespread. Adopting the Hanafi school as official, the Otto­
man government helped to establish this school in Constanti­
nople and in many other Islamic centers. With the rise of the
$afawl dynasty at the opening of the sixteenth century, Persia
gradually adopted the Shx't system. However, the Shaft'! school

THE TEXT OF THE RISALA
Manuscripts
THERE ARE two manuscripts of the Risdla at the
Dar al-Kutub, the National Library in Cairo. No others have
been discovered. The first, known as the manuscript of Ibn
Jama‘a, consists of 124 folios. The other, known as the manu­
script of al-Rabi', is the older and by far the more interesting.
In its present form, it consists of 78 folios; 62 constitute the
text, and the rest, of more recent vintage, presumably, consist
of the certificates of readers—persons who had read or heard
the reading of the original text. The size of the manuscript is
x 10£ inches. On the whole the writing is clear, although
not as legible as the manuscript of Ibn Jama*a. Rarely, how­
ever, is it obscure or impossible to read.
The manuscript of al-Rabi* is divided into three parts, each
forming a juz’ (tome). This artificial division should not be
taken to mean that the Risdla was originally divided into
three volumes, since a juz’ is more likely to end abruptly in
the middle of a paragraph rather than at the end of a chapter.
Such a division was necessitated by the use of three sets of
notebooks, each set called a juz’ and consisting of some twenty
folios. The copying of books in separate sets of notebooks
seems to have been a practice common among Muslim writers:
The artificiality of this division seems to make it advisable not
to follow it in the present translation.
The so-called al-Rabi* manuscript, alleged to have been the
text written by al-Rabi* himself rather than one copied from

t r a n s l a t o r ' s in t r o d u c t io n

49

an older text of al-Rabi‘, has become a subject of controversy
among several scholars. Moritz held that it was written in the
middle of the fourth century (the latter part of the tenth
century A. D.) .143 He gave no explanation as to how he arrived
at this date of the manuscript, but Shaykh Ahmad Shakir (d.
1958) , an editor of the Risdla, with whom the present writer
had the opportunity of discussing this problem shortly before
his death in Cairo, pointed out that probably Moritz arrived
at this conclusion on the basis of a statement in the margin of
the lbn Jama'a manuscript in which it was stated that the
latter was compared with an older one—the Rabi' manuscriptcopied in the year 358 of the Hijra.1*4 Shakir is of the opinion
that the Rabi* manuscript must have been about a century
earlier, at least shortly before the death of al-Rabi‘ in 270/883,
Although the difference between Moritz and Shakir in the
dating of the Rabi* manuscript is less than a century, Shakir’s
opinion raises a number of problems. If the date were shortly
before 270/883, the manuscript would probably have been
written on papyrus rather than on paper, which had just been
introduced into Egypt. Moreover, the style of writing, except
the titles of each juz\ which are in Kufic, is a cursive book
hand. To these objections Shakir replied that paper had
already been introduced into Egypt in the late second century
of the Islamic era and the shift of style from Kufic to cursive
had already begun. He quoted a statement from al-Qalqashandi
maintaining that although it is commonly accepted that lbn
Muqla (d. 328/939) was the first to introduce the new style
of writing, it had already been in vogue since the second
century of the Islamic era.145 Furthermore, he pointed out

348 Abu al-'Abbas Ahmad al-Qalqashandi, Kitdb Subh al-'Asha (Cairo,
1922), Vol. Ill, p. 15; Shakir's introduction, pp. 18-19. For a critical
evaluation of the commonly accepted fact that lbn Muqla was the first
to introduce the new Arabic style, see Nabia Abbott, " T h e Contribution
of lbn Muqlah to the North Arabic Script,” American Journal of Semitic
Languages and Literatures, Vol. LVI (1939), pp. 70-83; and The Rise of

that there is at the Dar al-Kutub in Cairo a papyrus dated
195/810, which resembles the Rabi* manuscript in style. How­
ever, this apparent resemblance, which Shakir advanced in
support of his argument, can be very misleading to nonexperts
in paleography. Finally, he asserted that the certificates of
readers often refer to this manuscript as belonging to al-RabP,
which, in Shakir’s view, wa's evidence of its being aI-RabI*’$
own copy;
There seems to be no conclusive argument in favor of the
viewpoints of either Shakir or Moritz on the strength of in­
ternal evidence alone. The manuscript would probably have
been on papyrus were it written in al-Rabl'’s time, although
this argument cannot be regarded as conclusive evidence against
its having been one of the first books written on paper in
Egypt.1*® The style of the manuscript, which became the
common style only a century after the time of al-Rabi‘, tends
to support the viewpoint of Moritz. Professor Nabia Abbott,
an expert in Arabic paleography (with whom the writer dis­
cussed the problem of style on the basis of photographic copies
of samples of the manuscript), is inclined to accept a fourthcentury dating.
As internal evidence fails to support either viewpoint, we
must call upon external evidence for a more conclusive argu­
ment. The present writer has examined the manuscript and
the condition of its paper in particular. The paper, though
undoubtedly ancient, can give us no final answer on the basis
of its present condition. A revealing external examination
may be conducted on the strength of a chemical analysis of
the paper and ink, an examination which the authorities of
the Dar al-Kutub seem unprepared to undertake at the present
moment. Until that is done, an expert opinion on whether

Editions
Of the four known editions of the Risdla, only two deserve
serious consideration, the Bulaq and the.Shakir editions. The
other two are inferior in quality and at any rate are based on
no other known manuscript.
The Bulaq edition is based on the Ibn Jama'a manuscript
and constitutes some eighty-two pages of the first volume of
the Kitab al-Umm, published by the Bulaq Government Press
in Cairo in 1321/1904. The editor did an extremely competent
piece of work in examining the manuscript, but he confined
himself, unfortunately, to one manuscript only. W ith all its
merits, this remains an uncritical edition of the Risdla, lacking,
among other things, any comparison with the RabP manuscript.
The Shakir edition, published in Cairo by the fjalabi Press
in 1358/1940, is a more elaborate work running to some 670
pages and including an introduction, notes, and eight appen­
dices. The erudition and competence of the late learned
Shaykh, universally recognized by scholars, have rendered
possible not only the publication of the Risdla in a separate
volume, but also the editing tand the publication of several
other works.
Shakir’s edition is based on the so-called al-Rabi‘ manu­
script. Shakir confines himself to that text rather than seeking
to reproduce a reconstruction of the twq manuscripts. He
indicates in the footnotes; however, the verbal differences
between the Bulaq edition and the al-Rabt* manuscript. His
edition is enriched by a number of linguistic and historical
comments with virtually full references to the Quranic com­
munications. His references to hadlth digests are less full and
often incomplete. He seldom explains ShafiTs terms and legal
concepts. Nor is the bibliography (pp. 609-610) satisfactory;

52

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

indeed some of the references in the footnotes are more helpful
than the bibliography. In comparing the original manuscript
with the Shakir edition, it is evident that Shakir has usually
avoided the incorporation of corrections and comments on the
original text, and that when he did incorporate them in
certain instances in the belief that they would improve the
text, he has indicated them by parentheses. But Shakir's edi­
tion is far from being critical; and the need for a more com­
plete and scholarly edition continues to exist.

The Translation
To the present writer’s best knowledge, a complete trans­
lation of the Risala has not been made into any foreign lan­
guage. A brief summary of it is available in Dutch,147 but this
lays no claim to completeness of translation.
Written in broad and often abstract terms, the Risala pre­
sents a number of difficulties to the translator. A translation
of the meaning only serves to deprive the reader of the spirit
and significance of the original text; a closely literal trans­
lation may render the broad abstract concept in the English
language more specific than the author intended. Shaft*! is
often fond of expressing his ideas in terse or incomplete sen­
tences which would probably become meaningless in another
language. The present writer has, therefore, provided the
equivalent in English in as close and literal a translation as
possible, with occasional words or sentences added in paren­
theses to complete the meaning of a sentence or to clarify an
abstract concept. No attempt was made to recast the original
in a completely modern style. The definitions of basic terms
and concepts and the supplementary material in the notes may
help to explain the meaning of the tt.*‘ in translation. The
notes are also intended to indicate the principal sources availa­
ble for the material dealt with in the Risala.

Although the original text of the Risala has undergone
several revisions and the rewriting of certain portions, some
of Shafi'i’s ideas have been repeated over and over again,
though in different forms, and no attempt has been made in
this translation to omit repetitions. Two chapters of the
Risala do not appear to fit into the logical order of the book.
These are the chapters "O n the Nature of God’s Orders of
Prohibition and the Prophet’s Orders of Prohibition ” and
“ On Legal Knowledge." In the original text they follow the
chapter " On Traditions," which may have been inserted to
answer certain points raised by an interlocutor. As the chapter
on legal knowledge consists of a discussion of a general juris­
prudential nature, it was deemed necessary to transfer it so
that it follows the chapter “ On al-Bayan and the chapter
on the nature of God’s orders of prohibition and the Prophet’s
orders of prohibition was transposed to the position preceding
the discussion on traditions. The latter portion of the chapter
on al-Bayan, dealing with the Arabic character of the Qur’an,
has been shifted to form the first section of the chapter " On
the Book of God." In order to preserve the character and the
general scheme of the book which the author laid down, no
other attempts have been made to change or completely recast
the structure of the work.
Neither the original Arabic texts nor the Bulaq edition
were divided into subdivisions in addition to the basic di­
visions into chapters. The Shakir edition, however, is sub­
divided into numbered paragraphs. Shakir’s system, artificially
divides the book into so many paragraphs that it has been
abandoned here. The present writer, accordingly, has followed
a different method in subdividing the chapters into paragraphs.

POSTSCRIPT

COMPARED with the Ibn Jama'a manuscript, the alRabP manuscript is relatively free from the frequent citations
of blessings which may be found in abundance in later classi­
cal writings. Although most of the blessings in the text of
al-Rabi* have been rendered into the nearest English equiva­
lents, it did not seem essential to retain all of them.
References to such works as the Encyclopaedia of Islam,
Brockelmann’s Geschichte der Arabischen Literatur, and
leading dictionaries, which are well-known to students of
Islam, have been considered unnecessary.
The abbreviations most frequently used are the following:
The letter b., if inserted between two names, stands for ibn
or bin, which means " the son of."
Q is the abbreviation for Qur’an.
1/632 cites the date according to the Hijra and the Gre­
gorian calendars.
B and S stand for the Bulaq and Shakir editions. They
appear in the margin of the translation to indicate the end of
the corresponding pages of the Bulaq and Shakir editions.

Him with such praise as is obligatory on account of His kind­

mitted and for what I have deferred—with the pleading of
one who confesses himself in a state of servitude 3 and who

who has no associate whatever, and that Muhammad is His

He [God] sent him [to mankind] at a time when men
were‘divided into two groups.
One of them being the People of the Book,8 who had
changed some of its rules, and misbelieved in God, since they
forged falsehood fashioned by their tongues and mixed it with
the T ruth that God had revealed to them. For God, Blessed sb
and Most High, mentioned to His Prophet* some of their B2
misbelief, saying;
Among them there is a party that twist their tongues with the
Book, in order that you may reckon it to be a part of the Book,
and they say: ' It is from God,’ although it is not from God; and
they speak falsehood against God knowingly [Q. Ill, 72].
• I. e„ in the service of the Lord.
‘ T h e recital of this formula, called the profession of faith, con­
stitutes the first of the Five Pillars of Islam (al-arkan al-khamsa), and
it is the duty of every Muslim’ to recite it whenever it is deemed neces­
sary or commendable. Any individual who desires to become a Muslim
must first recite it. T he other four pillars are: prayer, payment of alms,
fasting of the month of Ramadan, and pilgrimage. See ShafiTs Risala,
Chap. VI. For a detailed discussion of this subject, sec ShSfi'J, Kitab
al-XJmm, Vols. 1-2.
*Ahl al-Kitib-^People of the Book—are those who possess a Scripture.
They include Christians, Jews, Samaritans, Sabians, and Magians (Zoroastrians). For a discussion on their status in Islamic law, see Majid Khadduri, War and Peace in the Law of Islam, Chap. 17.
• Although Shafi‘1 uses the terms “ Apostle ” (rasul) and " Prophet "
(nabl), no distinction is made between the two, and they seem to him
to be synonymous. Muslim publicists, however, have distinguished between
the two terms: A Prophet is a man who receives divine revelations; an
Apostle is a man who not only receives divine revelations but also
communicates them to men. Thus every Apostle is a Prophet, but not
every Prophet is an Apostle. Sec Nasafi’s Creed (with a commentary by

And He said:
So woe to those who write the Book with their hands and then
say: ‘This is from God,' that they may sell it for a little price.
Woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them
for their earnings [Q. II, 73].
And He, Blessed and Most High, said:
The Jews say: 'TJzayr* is the son of God,' and the Christians
say: ‘ The Messiah is the son of G o d th a t is the utterance of
their mouths, conforming to what was formerly said by those who
had previously disbelieved—God oppose theml How they are
perverted! They have taken their rabbis and their monks as
lords rather than God, although the Messiah is the son of Mary,
and they were commanded to worship only one God. There is
no God at all but Him. Exalted is He above what they associate
[with him] [Q. IX, 30-31].
And He, Blessed and Most High, said:
Didst thou not see those who have received a portion of the Book
believing in the idol and the vain thing and saying to those
who misbelieved: *These are better guided than those who have
believed [in the revelation of the Qur’an]' ? Those are they
whom God cursed, whomsoever God curses shall never find for
himself any defender [Q. IV, 54-55].
The other [group] was that of those who misbelieved in
God and created [something] that God did not permit. They
set up with their hands stones and wood and images that they
found pleasing and gave them names that they forged and
called them gods and worshipped them. When they were
pleased with [something] other than what they worshiped,
they cast [the latter] away and set up with their hands that
other [thing] and worshiped it—those were the Arabs.8
* Although the Jews can hardly think of Ezra as the son of God, ‘Uzayr
has been generally identified with Ezra, See Tabari, Tafsir (Cairo, 1958),
Vol. XIV, pp. 201-205; J. Walker, “ Who is 'Uzayr,” Moslem World, Vol.
XIX (1929), pp. 303-306; and 'Uzayr in Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam,

A group of the Persians followed their path in this
respect and in the worship of whatever they pleased, whether
fish or beast or star or fire or something else.
Wherefore God mentioned to His Prophet one of the answers
of some of this sort [of men] who worshiped other than Him,
quoting from them:
We, indeed, found our fathers forming a community, so we follow
in their footsteps [Q. XLIII, 21].
And He, Blessed and Most High, quoted their saying:
Do not abandon your gods; do not abandon Wadd or Suwa‘, or
Yaghuth and Ya'uq, or Nasr.® Thus they led many astray [Q.
LXXI, 22-23].
And the Most High said:
And mention Abraham in the Book; surely he was a trusty man,
a prophet, when he said to his father: *Father, why worshipest
thou that which neither hears nor sees, nor avails thee anything?'
[Q. XIX, 42-43].
And He said:
And recite to them the story of Abraham. When he said to his
father and his people: ‘ What do you serve?' They said: *We
serve idols, and to them we continue cleaving/ He said: ‘Do
they hear you when you pray, or profit you or harm?' [Q. XXVI,
69-73].
Concerning this group, reminding them of his favors, and
warning them all of their erring, and His favor to those of
them who believed, He said:
Remember the favor of God to you when you were enemies; for
He brought your hearts together and by His favor you became
brothers. You were on the brink of a pit of fire and He delivered
you from it. Thus God makes His signs clear for you, perchance
you will let yourselves be guided [Q. Ill, 98-99].
* Wadd, Suwa‘, Yaghuth, Ya'uq, and Nasr were idols worshipped by the
Arabs before Islam. See Hisham b. al-Kalbi, Kitab al-Asndm; English
translation by Nabih Faris, Book of Idols (Princeton, 1952), pp. 8, 9, 10.
These idols, according to Bayd^wl, were originally the names of saintly
persons whom the Arabs raised to the level of divinity. See Baydawl's
Tafsir (Cairo, 1305/1887), p. 762.

[Shafi‘1] said: Before His deliverance of them by Muham­
mad, God's blessing and peace be upon him, they were mis­
believers, individually and collectively, having in common the
gravest of things: The disbelief in God and committing what
He does not permit- God is High above what they profess.
There is no God other than He, exalted be He with praise
of him, Lord and Creator of all things. Whoever of them is
alive is as [He] described his state: living, working, speaking
under the anger of his Lord, increasing his -disobedience.
Whoever has died is as [He] described his word and his work:
He has gone to his punishment.10

5. When [the revelation embodied in] the decree of the
heavenly Book reached its appointed time and the Providential
order became a reality through the manifestation of His re­
ligion, which He chose, after the predominance of disobedience
to Him, which He disapproved—He opened the gates of His
heavens by His mercy, just as His Providential order did not
cease to be executed in His foreknowledge at the time of the
revelation of His law in the past centuries. For He, Blessed
and Most High, said:

T h e people were one nation; then G od set forth the prophets
as bringers of good tidings and w arners [Q. II, 209].

The One whom He chose for His revelation, the Elect One
for His message, the One favored above all His creatures
through the gift of His mercy and the sealing of His prophet^
and the most universal of whatever He sent any messenger
with previously, was Muhammad, His servant and His Apostle.
Mention of him is upraised together with mention of Him in
this life. He is the intercessor whose intercession is looked for
in the next life. He is the purest of His creatures in soul; the
One who combines most fully every character that is pleasing
to Him in spiritual and temporal life. He is the best [in
mankind] in ancestry and family.
And He acquainted us and all mankind with his [Muham10 Cf. Q. Ill, 185; and X I, 19.

mad's] special graces and their universal benefit for religion,
and the life of this world .11 For of him He said:
There has come to you an apostle from among yourselves; grievous
.unto him is the difficulty you have experienced,12 who is watchful
over you, and who is gentle and compassionate with the believers
[Q. IX, 129].
And He said:
. . . That you might warn the Mother of Cities and those around
it [Q. XLII, 5].
The Mother of Cities is Makka, the city of his [Muham­
mad’s] people.
And He said:
And warn thy clan, thy nearest kin JQ. XXVI, 214],
And He said:
Surely it is a reminder to thee and to thy people, and assuredly
you will be questioned [Q. XLI II, 43].
6. Shafi‘1 said: Concerning [God’s] saying, “ Surely it is a
reminder to thee and to thy people,” [Q. XLIII, 43] [Sufyan]
b. ‘Uyayna, on the authority of Ibn Abl Najih from Mujahid,
told us: It has been asked: “ To whom did the mtm [Mu­
hammad] belong? ” “ To the Arabs,” was the reply; and it
was asked: “ T o what [tribe] of the Arabs?” “ To Quraysh,”
was the reply.
7. Shafi‘1 said: Mujahid’s comment on [God’s saying] is so
clear in the text [of the Qur’an] that it needs no explanation.
God, praise be to Him, specified [Muhammad’s] people and

in accordance with His saying [in the Qur’an]: “ Warn thy
clan, thy nearest of kin " [Q. XXVI, 214].
A few of those who are learned in the Qur’an have asserted
that the Apostle said:
Men of ‘Abd-ManSf! ** God has sent me to warn my nearest of
kin, and you are those nearest of kin.

Najih from Mujahid who [in giving the meaning of God's
saying]: “ And we have raised for thee thy reputation” [Q.
XCIV, 4], said: “ Whenever I [God] am mentioned, you
[Muhammad] are mentioned too ” [e. g., in the word of wit­
ness]: “ I profess that there is no god at all but God and that
Muhammad is the Apostle of God.” 15
9. [Shaft*! said]: This means (but God knows best) the in­
clusion of [Muhammad's] name in [pronouncing] the profes­
sion of the faith and in the calling of the believers to prayer.
It may also mean mentioning his name in reading the Qur’an,
in acts of obedience and avoiding disobedience.
May God bless and give peace to our Prophet whenever his
name is mentioned by those who may remember, or omitted
by those who disregard him. May God bless him among the
first and the last generation, with the most favorable, most
abundant and most gracious blessing that He has bestowed
upon any of His creatures. May He grant you and us virtue
by His blessing upon Him more than he granted to any of his
nation by His blessing* and peace. May His peace and mercy
and blessing be upon [Muhammad]. May God reward him
on our behalf with the most abundant reward bestowed on
any messenger sent on behalf of those to whom he was sent.
For God has delivered us from falsehood 16 through him and
made us members of the best community established for men

chose for us and by virtue of which [religion] He made pure
His angels and those of His creatures He favored with it.
No blessing—hidden or visible—has ever descended upon us,
through which we obtained spiritual or temporal gain or by
which spiritual or temporal hurt was dispelled, but Muham­
mad was the cause of its dispatch, the leader to its benefit and

[dissipator of] the sources of evil, which oppose righteousness,
and Warner against whatever causes falsehood, and he is ever

sis

A n d verily it is a Book sublime, falsehood comes not to it from
before o r from behind; a revelation from O n e who is All-wise
an d Praisew orthy [Q. X L I, 41-42].

[By virtue of this Book] He brought forth [Muhammad’s
people] from misbelief and ignorance 17 into the light and
guidance. He made clear to them [in the Book] what He
permitted—showing favor by permitting His creatures—and
what He prohibited, as He knows best what pertains to their
felicity by avoidance of it in this world and in the hereafter.
He tested their obedience by placing them under obligation
in word and deed, and by enjoining abstinence from forbidden
things from which He has warded them off, and He rewarded
them for their obedience by granting eternal life in Paradise
and deliverance from His vengeance, whereby His bounty was
made abundant. Praiseworthy is He. And He taught them
what He made due [as punishment] for those who disobey
Him, in contrast to what He made due [as reward] for those
who obey Him.
And He admonished them by calling their attention [to the
experiences] of former people who had more property and

children and who lived longer and left [behind them] more
memorable deeds. They enjoyed their fortune during their
earthly life. When He made His judgement, death took them
suddenly for their lapses and they received [God's] punish­
ment at the end of their terms of life so that they take prior
warning of future happening and understand [God's com­
mands] as stated clearly [in the Qur’an] in order to be awake
before being taken by surprise, and perform [their deeds]
before the end of the period when an offender is not reproved
and a ransom is not taken “ on the day when each Soul will
find brought before it the good and the evil that it has done,
it will wish that there were a far distance between it and that
day " [Q- HI, 28].
All that [God]—glorified be His praise—has revealed in His
Book is a mercy [from Him] and an evidence [for His existence].
Whoever knows [the Book], knows it; and whoever is ignorant
of it, is ignorant of it. He who is ignorant of it, does not know
it, and he who knows it, is not ignorant of it. For the public
is divided into classes with regard to knowledge. Their status
in learning is according to their rank in knowledge of it.
It is obligatory upon him who seeks knowledge to exert his
utmost energy in increasing his knowledge, to be patient with
every obstacle that may stand in his way, and to be sincere to
God in understanding His knowledge—whether [to be found]
in the text [of the Book] or [obtained] by deductive reasoning—
and (to appeal to God for help, for nothing good is obtainable
save by God’s help.
For he who has obtained knowledge of God’s commands
from His Book, whether as [provided] in the text or through
istidlal (inductive reasoning), and—had God's help in word
and deed in whatever he learned of it—attains virtue in his
spiritual and temporal [life], doubt leaves him, wisdom en­
lightens his heart and is entitled to the position of imama:
leadership in religious matters.
We pray to God—who offers His blessings ere we deserve
them and who continues to do so in spite of our negligence to
our obligatory gratefulness to Him, and who made us the best

Shafi'I said: No misfortune will ever descend upon any
of the followers of God's religion for which there is no guidance

[ON AL-BAYAN (PERSPICUOUS
DECLARATION) ] 1
What is al-Bayan?
12.
Shaft*! said; Al-Bayan is a collective term for a
variety of meanings 2 which have common roots but differing
ramifications. The least [common denominator] of these linked
but diverging meanings is that they are [all] a perspicuous
declaration for those to whom they are addressed, and in
whose tongue the Qur’an was revealed; 2 they are of almost
equal value for these persons, although some declarations were
made emphatically clearer than others, though they differed
[in clarity] to persons ignorant of the Arab tongue.
13.
Shaft'! said: The sum-total of what God has declared to
His creatures in His Book, by which He invited them to wor­
ship Him in accordance with His prior decision, includes
various categories.
1 Al-bayan may mean either the substance of a certain Quranic com­
munication or making clear the meaning of that substance. T he nearest
equivalent for the first is speech or declaration; for the second, making
ludd or perspicuous. Since both meanings are often implied in ShafiTs
usage, the combined terminology " perspicuous declaration ” has been
chosen. For the meaning of al-bayan, see al-Ghazzalt, al-Mustasfa, Vol. I,
pp. 153-54; al-Baqillani, Vjdz al-Qufan, ed. Ahmad $aqr (Cairo, 1954),
pp. 69-70, 3197320; and the Translator’s Introduction pp. 33-34, above.
1 Ma’ani (singular: Ma'na) may signify either an intention or an ex­
pression of meaning or reason. The English equivalent of meanings, in
the sense of ideas, is used here.
* I. e., the Arabs.
t

One of these is what He has declared to His creatures by
texts [in the Qur’an], such as the aggregate of duties owing
to Him: T hat they shall perform the prayer, pay the zakat
(alms tax) , perform the pilgrimage, and observe the fast. And
that He has forbidden disgraceful acts4—both visible and
hidden—and in the textual [prohibition of] adultery, [the
drinking of] wine, eating [the flesh of] dead things and of
blood and pork; and He has made clear to them how to per­
form the duty of [the major] ablution as well as other matters
stated precisely in the text [of the Qur’an].
A second category consists of [those duties] the obligation
of which He established in His Book, but the modes of which
He made clear by the tongue of His Prophet. The number
of prayers [each day] and the [amount of] zakat and their
time [of fulfilment] are cases in point; but there are other
[similar] duties which He has revealed in His Book.
A .third category consists of that which the Apostle of God
established by example or exhortation, but in'regard to which
there is no precisely defined rule from God [in the Qur’an],
For God has laid down in His Book the obligation of obedience
to His Apostle and recourse to his decision. So he who accepts
[a duty] on the authority of the Apostle of God accepts it
by the obligation imposed by God.
A fourth category consists of what God commanded His
creatures to seek through ijtihad (personal reasoning) 6 and
by it put their obedience to the test exactly as He tried their
obedience by other duties which He had ordered them [to
fulfil], for the Blessed and Most High said:
And We shall put you to the trial in order to know those of
. you who strive and endure, and Wn will test your accounts [Q.
XLVII, 33].
* Al-fawShish.
_B Ijtihad literally means personal effort to understand the meaning
implied in a certain rule of law in order to form an opinion. It implies
personal legal reasoning which should be exercised by applying analogy
(qiySs) to an authoritative text such as the Qur’an or tradition. For a
discussion on the use of ijtihad, see Chap. XIII, below; and J. Schacht,
Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence, pp. 1Q5 £., 127 f., 132.

A n d He sa id :

Perchance your L ord w ill destroy your enemy, and will make
you successors in the land, that H e may see how you will act

Shaft*! said: [God ordered the performance of prayer]
in the direction 0 of the Sacred Mosque 7 and said to His
Prophet:
Sometimes W e see thee tu rn in g thy face about toward the heaven.
So W e will tu rn thee to a direction th a t w ill satisfy thee. T u rn
thy face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque, and w herever you
are, tu rn your faces in its direction [Q. II, 139].

And He said:
And from w hatever place thou hast gone forth, tvirn thy face in
the direction of the Sacred M osque; and w herever you may be,
turn your faces in its direction [Q. II, 145].

Thus [God], glorified be His praise, guided [men]—should
they be at a distance from the Sacred Mosque—by using the
reasoning powers which he has implanted in men and which
discriminate between things and their opposites and the land­
marks which [He] set up for them when the Sacred Mosque,
towards which He commanded them to turn their faces, is out
of sight. For God said: '
For it is H e who has m ade for you the stars, th a t you m ight be
guided by them in the darkness of land an d sea [Q. VI, 97].

And He said:
And by landm arks and by the stars they are guided [Q. X V I, 16].

15. Shaft*! said: 8 Such landmarks may be the mountains,
the nights and the days, which have winds of known names
though they blow from different directions, and the sun and
the moon and the stars whose risings and settings and whose
places in the sky are known.
Thus [God] prescribed to men the use of personal reasoning
in turning in the direction of the Sacred Mosque by means of
guidance to them, which I have described, and so long as men
use their personal reasoning they will not deviate from His
command, glorious be His praise; but He did not permit them
to pray in any direction they wished if the Sacred Mosque
were out of sight. And He also instructed them about His
will and providence and said: “ Does man think that he will
be left roaming at will? ” [Q. LXXV, 36]. “ Left roaming at
will ” means one who is neither commanded nor prohibited.
16. [Shaft*! said]: This [communication] indicates that no
one—other than the Prophet—is allowed to make a decision
except by istidlal in the way that I have described con­
cerning these matters and concerning justice and penalties in
hunting; nor should any man make use of istihsan 9 (juristic
preference), for to decide by istihsan means initiating some­
thing himself without basing his decision upon a parallel
example.
God commanded men that they should call as witnesses two
men of just character.10 Just character means acting in
obedience to God. Thus was the path showing the knowledge
* Bulaq ed., p. 5.
* Istihsan is the method of legal reasoning through which the jurist
seeks an opinion for which there is either no authority in the tradition
or for which there are two authorities, one of them being preferred. For
ShafiTs arguments against istihsan, see Chap. XIV, below; and Kitab
al-Umm, Vol. VII, pp. 267 ff.
10 Two men of just character {'adl) constitute the minimum number
of witnesses required in testimony (shahada). T he witness must be
'adl—equitable, just, well-known for telling the truth—therefore it means
the possession of a cha.acter which renders his testimony valid. The
nearest equivalent therefore is the combination “ just character." See
Ibn Farhun, Tabsirat abfiukkam (Cairo, 1302/1884), Vol. I, pp. 173, 204;

its proper place,11 and I have cited examples which .1 hope
have indicated [the meaning] of others not dealt with in
parallel situations.

S25

alBayan I
17 .
Shafi'x said : 12 With respect to visitation [of the Ka'ba],13
God, Blessed and Most High, said:

Whoever makes use of the minor pilgrimage in order to perform
the [great] Pilgrimage, shall bring as an offering what he can
easily afford; but if he finds none, then a fast of three days in
the course of Pilgrimage, and seven upon your return, that is
ten altogether; that applies to those whose families are not present
at the Sacred Mosque [Q. II, 192].

B5

Thus it was dearly understood by those to whom this com­
munication was addressed that the three-day fasting during
Pilgrimage and the seven-day [fasting] after the return [from
Pilgrimage] make ten days altogether. For God said: “ These

are ten altogether” [Q. II, 192]. This communication was
either intended to state precisely [the meaning] or to instruct
men that if three are added to seven the total is,ten. And
He said:
We had an appointment with Moses for thirty nights, and We
completed them with ten [more] so that the full period of his
Lord's appointment was forty nights [Q. VII, 138].
11 See Chap. XIII, below.
18 Bulaq ed., p. 5.
11 There are two kinds of pilgrimages: the major and the minor; the
first (al-fiajj) is the fifth of the five pillars (arkan) of Islam (see Chap.
1, note 4; and paragraph 155, below), which must be performed at the
tenth of the month of Dhu-al-Hijja, during the ‘Id al-adha; the second
fUmra) is the minor or lesser pilgrimage which might be performed at
any other time. T he major pilgrimage is a duty to be performed by those
who are able, at least once in a lifetime; the other is supererogatory. See
paragraph 156, below.

S26

72

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

So it was clearly understood by those to whom this com­
munication was addressed that thirty and ten nights make
forty.
Shafi'i said: 14 God’s saying: “ Forty nights ” may either
mean the same as the foregoing communication, namely, that
if thirty are added to ten the total is forty, or it may have
been intended to specify more clearly the meaning.
18. Shafi’i said: 1S God said:
Fasting is prescribed for you as it was for those before you; p er­
haps you will show piety. A certain num ber of days [of fasting],
b u t if any of you be sick o r on a journey, then a num ber of other
days [Q. II, 179-180].

And He said:
T h e m o n th of R am adan in which the Q u r’an was sent dow n as
guidance for the people and as clear signs of the guidance and
the salvation 10 (fu rq a n )—so let those of you who witness [the
arrival of] the m onth fast it; b u t if anyone is sick or on a journey
[let him fast] a num ber of other days [Q .-JI, 181].

Thus [God] laid down the duty [for men] to fast, specifying
that it shall be for a month; and the mouth, according to [the
Arabs] is the period between two [successive] crescents, which
may be either thirty or twenty-nine [days]. The guidance im­
plied in this legislation, as well as in the two foregoing ones,
is to state more clearly the total number.
The most likely interpretation [of this communication] is
that it specifies the total number of seven and three, and
thirty and ten, that is, to state more precisely the meaning,
since men surely must have known these two numbers and
their totals just as they have known the month of Ramadan.

shafi'i said: 17 God, Blessed and Most High, said:

W hen you stand u p for the Prayer, wash your faces a n d your
hands up to the elbows, an d wipe your heads, an d your feet up
to the ankles; and if you are polluted, purify yourselves [Q. V,
8-9].

And He said:
N or [when you are] polluted, then purify yourselves, unless you
be travellers on the road.1*

Thus God’s Book has provided a precise definition of [the
duty of] ablution, which must be distinguished from cleansing
with stones (istinja*), and purifying from pollution .18
It has been laid down that [the duty of] washing the face
and the limbs must be performed by a minimum of one
[washing] for each, and it may mean more than once. The
Prophet has specified that [the duty of] ablution shall be per­
formed once, but he himself performed it three times. It
follows that the minimum requirement in performing [ablu­
tion] is to wash the limb once. The minimum requirement
for [complete] washing is likewise once. Since only once is
[the legal] requirement, the three [washings] are optional.
The sunna laid down that three stones are required to per­
form cleansing (istinja’) , and the Prophet indicated what con­
stitutes ablution and complete washing. He also indicated
that the ankles and the elbows should be included in the
washing, for the text [in the Qur'an] may mean washing [the
1TBulaq ed., p, 6.
18 Q. IV, 46. T he latter part of this communication is not given by
Shafi'i.
10 For the meaning of ablution, see Chap. VII, section 2, below. Cleansing
with stones after defecation is istinja', and cleaning from jaimba (pollu­
tion) is prerequisite for purification. See ShafiTs Kitdb el-Umm, Vol. I,
pp. 18, 38.

body], either excluding the two limits (the ankles and elbows)
or including them. Since the Apostle of God said: “ Woe to
the [unwashed] heels from the fire of hell," he obviously
specified washing rather than wiping.
20. Shaft*! said: 20 God said:
H is p arents receive, each of them , a sixth of w hat he has left,
if he has children; b u t if he has no children and his heirs are
his parents, then his m other receives a third; if, however, he has
brothers, his m other receives a sixth [Q. IV, 12],

sjfc

And He said:
A h alf of w hat your wives leave belongs to you if they have no
children; b u t if they have children, a fourth o f w hat they leave
belongs to you, after any bequests they may have m ade o r debts
[have been paid], . . . If a m an—or a w om an—whose property
is in h erited has no direct heirs, b u t has a bro th er o r a sister,
each of the two receives a sixth; if they be m ore than that, they
share in a third, after any bequests he may have m ade o r debts
[have been paid], w ithout prejudice one to th e o th er—a charge
from G od; verily G od is All-knowing, All-gracious [Q. IV, 13,

15-16].
These textual legislations [in the Q ur’an] have rendered
other narrative unnecessary. God, however, made a condition
thaG[an estate should not be distributed] until bequests are
executed and debts are paid. Thus the narrative indicates that
a bequest should not exceed one third [of the estate].21

Then He specified clearly by the tongue of His Apostle the
required number of prayers, their times and the modes of
their performance; the amount of zakat and the times of its
payment; the performance of the major (hajj) and minor
(•umra) pilgrimages and when these duties are required or
not required and when [the Prophet’s] sunnas are in agree­
ment or contradictory with each other. Other parallels may
be found in the Qur’an and the sunna.

Shaft'? said: [Al-Bayan] includes all that the Apostle has
provided in the sunna concerning which there is no [legis­
lation in the] Book. There is in this book,2*—concerning God’s
favoring mankind [with the ability] to understand the Book
and Wisdom—a proof that Wisdom is the sunna of the Apostle
of God.24

See Jurjani, pp. 96-97; and al-MutarrazI, Kitdb al-Mughrib (Hyderabad,
1328/1911), Vol, I, p. 133. Shafi'I, however, uses the term specifically for
legal orders derived from the sunna, distinguishing it from legal orders
based oh divine communication. His opinion is,based on the following
Quranic communications; Q. II, 123, 231, 146; IV, 113; XXXIII, 34; and
LXU, 2, in which wisdom follows the Qur'an and is interpreted to mean
the sunna. See paragraphs 160-62, 192-95; and Tabari, Tafstr, Vol. Ill,

fying the place it has in religion,25 is a proof of the precise
definition of the duties stated in the Qur’an, which consists
of the following categories:
The first category is what the Book has laid down with such
clarity that nothing further—in addition to revelation (tamil) —
was needed.
The second category consists in what is clearly stated in
the obligation imposed [by God] ordering obedience to the
Prophet. The Apostle in his turn precisely stated on the
authority of God what the duties are,2®upon whom they are
binding, and in what circumstances21, some of them are re­
quired or not required, and when they are binding.
The third category consists in what [God] has specified only
in the sunna of His Prophet, in the absence of a textual [legis­
lation in the] Book.
23.
Shafi'I said: 28 Everything [in the sunna of the Prophet]
is a clear explanation for the [divine communication in the]
Book of God.
So he who accepts the duties to God [laid down] in His
Book should accept the sunna of the Apostle by God's com­
mand ordering His creatutes to obey the Apostle and to
have recourse to his decision. For he who accepts [a duty] on
the authority of the Apostle accepts it from God, since God
has imposed the obligation to obey [the Prophet}.29
The acceptance of [all the duties] laid down in both the
Book of God and the sunna of the Apostle means the ac­
ceptance of each one as imposed by God, despite the differing
reasons for the acceptance of what He permitted or prohibited,

Shaft’! said: 30 God, Blessed and Most High, said:

And from w hatever place thou hast gone forth, tu rn thy face in
the direction of the Sacred M osque; and w herever you may be,
tu rn your faces in its direction [Q. II, 145],

Thus [God] laid down the duty that wherever men may be
they must turn their faces in the direction [of the Sacred
Mosque].31
The [use of the] term " direction " means that if the object
[the Sacred Mosque] is seen, then [the prayer] in that direction
is determined [by sight]; but if [the Mosque] is out of sight,
the direction is determined by ijtihad (personal reasoning) —
that is all that one is required to do.
S 34
God said:
It is H e who has appointed for you the stars, th a t by them you
may be guided through the darkness of land and sea [Q. VI, 97].
A nd He said:
And by landm arks and by the stars they m ight be guided [Q.
XVI, 16].

Thus [God] has set landmarks [for men to be guided by] and
erected the Sacred Mosque in whose direction they were
ordered to turn their faces [in prayer]. Their turning in that
direction [is determined either] by the landmarks set up by
Him or by the reasoning powers which He implaqt&d in them
to recognize the landmarks. All this is a clear declaration and
a favor from Him, glorious be His praise.
25. And He said:
And call in as witnesses two persons of just character from am ong
yourselves [Q. LXV, 2].
*° Bul5q ed., p. 7.
** Pan of paragraph 105 to the end of paragraph 110 [Shakir’s ed.] arc
omitted because they merely explain the literal, meaning of the words
shatr, and jiha, equivalent to '* tow ard" or "direction" (i.e., of the
Sacred Mosque in Makka).

78

JU R IS P R U D E N C E

And He said:
Such witnesses as you approve of [Q. II, 282].

[God] specified that [the person] of just character is he who
acts in accordance with [the command to obey God]. Thus
any one who seemed to be acting in accordance with [the
command to obey God] was regarded as of just character, and
any one who acted contrary [to the command to obey God]
was regarded as lacking in just character.
26. [God], glorified be His praise, said:
Do n o t kill gam e when you are in pilgrim sanctity; whoever of
you kill it intentionally, there shall be com pensation equal to
w hat he has killed from [his] flocks, as two persons of just charac­
ter am ong you shall decide—an offering to be delivered a t .the
K a'ba [Q. V, 96].

Equal compensation in kind literally means the nearest in
size to the body [of the game killed]. The viewpoints of the
Companions of the Apostle who expressed an opinion on game
are at one that compensation should be the nearest in size
to the body of the game. We should therefore examine the
game killed, and whatever of the livestock is found to resem­
ble it in size should be paid in compensation.
Equal compensation in kind for the livestock does not mean
compensation in price save in a far-fetched interpretation.
Of the two meanings, the literal is the more appropriate.
This [literal meaning] is sought by ijtihad, which any man
who makes a decision should apply in [determining] equal
compensation.
27. This kind of [legal] knowledge is an example of what
I have already discussed, [namely], that no one at all should
[give an opinion] on a specific matter by merely saying: It is
permitted or prohibited, unless he is certain of [legal] knowl­
edge, and this knowledge must be based on the Qur’an and
the sunna, or [derived] from ijma* (consensus) and qiyas
(analogy). The subject dealt with in this chapter belongs to
analogy, on the strength of which the right direction in

$3g

B7

s h a f i T s R isd la

79

prayer, just character, and equal compensation are to be S39
determined.
Analogy is [the method of reasoning] through which indica­
tions are sought from parallel precedents in the Qur’an or the
sunna—since these are the authoritative sources of the truth—
in determining what I have already stated such as the direction
in prayer, just character, and equal compensation. [Analogy’s]
conformity [to precedent] should be based on two conditions:
The first is that God or His Apostle have either prohibited
a certain a c t 82 by an [explicit] text [in the Qur’an and the
sunna] or permitted it by an [implied] reason. If such a reason
is found in the absence of a specific text in the Book or the
sunna, the act should be prohibited or permitted in con­
formity with the [implied] reason of permission or prohibition.
[The second] is that we may find a certain act analogous
to only one aspect of a certain precedent and analogous to
another aspect of another precedent, but neither the latter
nor the former provides a close analogy. In such a case,
analogy should be applied to the closest one as I have stated
[in] the example of the killing of game.
28.
Shafi'i said: There are two [categories of] viewpoints
concerning [legal] knowledge: one of them is ijma’ (agree­
ment) and the other is ikhtilaf (disagreement). These wilk
be dealt with elswhere [in this book].38 A case in point of
our knowledge cf the Book of God is that the entire Book
of God has been revealed in the Arab tongue. And [our] 8 4 0
knowledge of the abrogating and abrogated [communications]
of the Book of God ,34 the duties imposed [by. God] through
His revelations, the ethics [of the Book], guidance and per­
missibility [as provided in the Book]. And knowledge of the
position in which God has placed His Prophet as it is pre­
cisely defined in the commands of His Book and in the
utterances of His Prophet; and of what He meant by the isum
“ Sh2fi*I uses the broad term shay’ which means, literally, a thing.

total of the duties imposed by Him and upon whom [they are
binding], whether upon all His creatures or only upon some
of them, rather than others; and [the .obligation] laid down
by God ordering obedience to His Prophet an d recourse to
his decision; and knowledge of the parables demonstrating
obedience to God and indicating how to avoid disobedience
to Him as well as how to avoid missing one's t)wn fortune
and how to increase supererogatory favor [are all provided in
the Book of God].
It is the duty of those who have [legal] knowledge never to
express an opinion unless it is based on certainty. There are
cases where men have discussed matters relating to [legal]
knowledge when, if only they had abstained from so doing,
abstention would have been more appropriate and safer, I trust.

[ON LEGAL KNOWLEDGE] 1
29.
Someone asked me: 2 What is [legal] knowledge and
how much should men know of it?
30.
Shafi'l replied: Legal knowledge is of two kinds: one
is for the general public, and no sober and mature person
should be ignorant of it.
SI. He asked: For example?
32.
[Shafi'l] replied: For example, that the daily prayers are
five,3 that men owe it to God to fast the month of Ramadan,
to make the pilgrimage to the [Sacred] House whenever they
are able, and to ;[pay] the legal alms in their estate; that He
[God] has prohibited usury,* adultery, homicide, theft, [the
drinking of] wine, and [everything] of that sort which He has S357
obligated men to comprehend, to perform, to pay in their
property, and to abstain from [because] He has forbidden it to
them.
This kind of knowledge may be found textually in the Book

of God, or may be found generally among the people of Islam.
The public relates it from the preceding public and ascribes
it to the Apostle of God, nobody ever questioning its ascrip­
tion or its binding force upon them. It is the kind of knowl­
edge which admits of error neither in its narrative nor in its
interpretation; it is not permissible to question it.
33. He asked: What is the second kind? „
34. Shafi'l replied: It consists of the detailed duties and
rules obligatory on men, concerning which there exists neither
a text in the Book of God, nor regarding most of them, a
sunna. Whenever a sunna exists [in this case], it is of the kind
related by few authorities, not by the public, and is subject
to different interpretations arrived at by analogy.
35. He asked: Is [legal knowledge of] this kind as obliga­
tory as the other, or is it not obligatory so that he who acquires
such knowledge performs a supererogatory act, and he who
neglects it falls not into error? Or, is there a third kind,
derived from a narrative (khabar) or analogy?
36. [Shaft*!] replied: There is a third kind [of knowledge].
37. He asked: Will you explain it, give its source, and state
what [portion] of it is obligatory, and on whom it is binding
and on whom it is not binding?
38. [Shaft*!] replied: The public is incapable of. knowing
this kind of knowledge, nor can all specialists obtain it. But
those who do obtain it should not all neglect it. If some can
obtain it, the others are relieved of the duty [of obtaining it];
but those who do obtain it will be rewarded.
39. He asked: Will you cite a narrative or any other rele­
vant information as a basis for [using] analogy?
40. [Shafi'i] replied: God has imposed the [duty of] jihad
as laid down in His Book and uttered by His Prophet's tongue.
He stressed the calling [of men to fulfil] the jihad [duty] 6
as follows:
G od has bought from the believers th e ir selves an d th eir posses­
sions against [the gift of] Paradise. T h ey fight in the way of God;

they kill* and are killed; that is a promise binding upon God in
the Torah and Gospel and the Qur’an; and who fulfils his cove­
nant better than God? So rejoice in the bargain you have made
with Him. That is the-mighty triumph [Q. IX, 112].
And He said:
Fight the polytheists totally as they fight you totally; • and know
that God is with the godfearing [Q. IX, 36].
And He said:
Slay the polytheists wherever you find them, and take them, and
confine them, and lie in ambush for them everywhere. But if
they repent and perform the prayer and pay the zakat, then set
them free. God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate [Q. IX, 5],
And He said:
Fight those who do not believe in God nor in the Last Day, who
do not forbid what God and His Apostle have made forbidden,
and who do not practice the religion of truth, of those who have
been given the Book, until they pay the jizya out of hand and
have been humbled [Q. IX, 29].

‘Abd al-'Aziz b. Muhammad al-Darawardi 7 told us from

you: *Go forth in the way of God/ you sink down to the ground?.
Are you so content with this present life as to neglect the Here­
after? The enjoyment of this life is little in comparison with the
Hereafter. If you do not go forth, He will .inflict upon you a
painful punishment, and instead of you He will substitute another
people; and you will not hurt Him at all, for God is powerful
over everything [Q. IX, 38-39].

And He said:
Go forth, light and heavy! Struggle in God’s way with your
possessions and yourselvesl That is better for you, did you but
know [Q. IX, 41].

S3q

42.
[Shafi‘1] said: These communications mean that the
jihad, and rising up in arms in particular, is obligatory for
all able-bodied [believers], exempting no one, just as prayer,
pilgrimage and [payment of] alms are performed, and no
person is permitted to perform the duty for another, since
performance by one will not fulfil the duty for another.
They may also mean that the duty of [jihad] is a collective
(kifaya) duty different from that of prayer: Those who per­
form it in the war against the polytheists will fulfil the duty
and receive the supererogatory merit, thereby preventing those BJ0
who have stayed behind from falling into error.
But God has not put the two [categories of men] on an
equal footing, for He said:
Such believers who sit at home—unless they have an injuryare not the equals of those who fight in the path of God with
their possessions and their selves. God has given precedence to
those who fight with their possessions and their selves over those
who sit at home. God has promised the best of things to both,
and He has preferred those who fight over those who sit at home
by [granting them] a mighty reward [Q. IV, 97].
The literal meaning of this communication is that the duty
is obligatory on all men .9
*Cf. Bulaq ed., p. 51, which incorporates this statement with the
question of the interlocutor. See Shakir's comment in the Risala, p. 364,

43 . He asked: Where is the proof for your opinion that if
some people perform the duty, the others would be relieved
of punishment?
44. [Shafi'i] said: It is in the communication [that I have
just cited].
45 . He asked: In what part of it?
46. [Shafi'i] replied: God said: “ Yet to each God has
promised the best of things."
Thus God has promised **the best of things ” for those who
stayed behind and could not go to the jihad, although he
clearly specified his preference for those who went to the
jihad over those who stayed at home. If those who stayed at
home were in error, while others were fighting, they would be
committing a sin, unless God forgives them, rather than
receiving “ the best of things."
47 . He asked: Is there any other [proof]?
48. [Shafi'i] replied: Yes, God said:

S 364

It is not for the believers to go forth all together, but why should
not a party of every section of them go forth, to become learned
in religion, and to warn their people when they return to them,
perhaps they will beware [Q. IX, 123].
[When] the Apostle went to battle he was accompanied by
some of his companions while others stayed at home; for ‘Alt
b. Ab! Talib stayed at home during the battle of Tabuk. Nor
did God ordain that all Muslims were under obligation to go
to battle, for He said: "W hy should not a party of every
section of them go forth? " So He made it known that going
into battle was obligatory on some, not on all, [just] as knowl­
edge of the law is not obligatory on all but on some, save the
fundamental duties which should be known to all men. But
God knows best.
49. Shafi'i said : 10 In like manner are other duties ,11 the
fulfilment of which is intended to be collective; wherever

they are performed by some Muslims collectively, those who
do not perform them will not fall in error.
If all men failed to perform the duty so that no able-bodied
man went forth to battle, all, I am afraid, would fall into
error (although I am certain that this would never happen)
in accordance with [God’s] saying:
If you do not go forth, H e will inflict upon you a painful punish­
ment [Q. IX, 39].
50. He asked: What is the meaning [of this communication]?

51. [Shaft'!] replied: It means 12 that it is not permissible
that all men should fail to “ go forth
but that if some go
forth, so that a sufficient number fulfils [the collective duty],
the others do not fall into error, because the going forth by
some would fulfil the [duty of] ‘ going forth.’
52. He asked: Are there examples other than the jihad?
53. [Shafi'i] replied: [Yes, such as] the funeral and burial
prayers, the performance of which should not be neglected;
but men are not all under the obligation to attend to their
performance, for those who perform them will relieve those
who do not from falling into error.'
In the same [category falls the duty to] reply to a salutation.
For God said:
When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with a better one,
i or return it. Verily God keeps account of every tiling. [Q; IV, 88].

The Apostle of God said:
V
He who is standing shall greet him who is sitting. If [only] one
replies, to a-greeting, he would fulfil [the duty] on behalf o f the
others.13 i ts \
*

These are merely intended to mean that a reply must be
made. So the response of the few fulfils the duty for all who
are obligated to reply, for the [collective] response is sufficient.

So far as I have been informed, the Muslims have continued
to act as I have stated, from the time of the Prophet to the
present. Only a few men must know the law, attend the
funeral service, perform the jihad and respond to greeting,
while others are exempt. So those who know the law, perform
the jihad, attend the funeral service, and respond to a greeting
will be rewarded, while others do not fall into error since a

[their duty]: God forgiveth them and us.4 But, perhaps, he
who expressed the opinion that there are in the Qur'an [words]
which are not of the Arab tongue—and his opinion was accepted

prophet who apprehended all of it? However, no portion of
it escapes everyone, so that there is always someone who
knows it. Knowledge [of this tongue] to the Arabs is HI e the
knowledge of the sunna to the jurists (fuqaha’) : We know
of no one who possesses a knowledge of all the sunna without
missing a portion of it. So if the knowledge of all the scholars
is gathered together, the entire sunna would be known. [How­
ever], if the knowledge of each scholar is taken separately,
each might be found lacking in some portion of it, yet what
each may lack can be found among the others.
They [the scholars] may be divided, into various classes:
Those who possessive greater portion [of the sunna], although
they may have lacked some of it, and others who know less
than the others. The little of the sunna which may not be
known to [the scholar] who possesses the greater part of it is
not evidence that knowledge of it should be sought from
[scholars of] another class, but that what is lacking should
rather be sought from among his colleagues [of the same
class] until the entire sunna of the beloved Prophet5 is
gathered by each scholar separately. They [the scholars] vary
as to the degree of their comprehension [of the sunna];
In like manner is the [knowledge concerning the] tongue
of the Arabs by the scholars® and the public: No part of it
will be missed by them all, nor should it be sought from other
[people]; for no one can learn [this tongue] save he who has
learned it from [the Arabs], nor can anyone be as fluent [in
this tongue] as they unless he has followed them in the way
they learned it. He who has learned it from them should be
regarded as one of the people of that tongue.
Those who have adopted [tongues] other [than the Arabic],
have done so because they have neglected [this tongue]; if
they return to it, they will belong to its people.
Knowledge of the [Arabic] tongue is more widely spread
among the majority of Arabs than knowledge of the sunna
among the scholars.7

56. If someone says: May we not find some foreigners who
[are capable of] uttering some [words] in the Arab tongue?
This may be explained, as I have said, by the possibility of
learning them from [the Arabs]; otherwise 8 none could [possi­
bly] utter more than a few [words]. And he who has uttered
a few [words] will be [regarded as] belonging to the Arabs.
But we do not deny that [there may exist] in foreign tongues
certain words, whether acquired or transmitted, which may
be similar to those of the Arab tongue, just as some words in $44
one foreign tongue may be similar to those in others, although
these [tongues are spoken in] separate countries and are dif­
ferent and unrelated to one another despite the similarity in
some of the words.
57. Someone may ask: What is the proof that the Book of
God was [communicated] in a pure Arab tongue, unmixed
with others?
58.
' [Shafi'i replied]: The proof is [to be found] in the Book
of God [itself], for God said:
We never sent any messenger save with the tongue of his people
[Q. XIV, 4].

59. But if someone says: [Each of] the messengers before
Muhammad was sent to his own people, while Muhammad
was sent to all mankind. This may either mean that [Mu­
hammad] was sent with the tongue of his people and that all
others must learn his tongue—or whatever they can learn of
it—or that Muhammad was sent with the tongues of all [man­
kind]. Is there any evidence that-he was sent with the tongue
of his own people rather than with foreign tongues?
60. Shaft*! replied: 9 Since tongues vary so much that dif­
ferent [people] cannot understand one another, some must
adopt the language of the others. And preference must be
given to the tongue which others adopt.

whose tongue is their Prophet’s tongue. It is not permissible—
but God knows best—for the people of [the Prophet's] tongue
to become the followers of peoples whose tongues are other
than that [of the Prophet] even in a single letter; but rather
all other tongues should follow his tongue, and all the peoples
of earlier religions should follow his religion. For God has
declared this in more than one communication of His Book.
He said:
Verily it is the revelation of the Lord of the worlds, brought
down by the Faithful Spirit, upon thy heart, that thou mayest be
of those who warn, in a clear Arabic tongue [Q. XXVI, 192-195].

And He said:
Thus have We sent it down as an Arabic Law [Q. XIII, 37],

And He said:
And so We have revealed to thee an Arabic Qur’an in order that
thou mayest warn the Mother of the Towns and the people of its
vicinity [Q. XLII, 5].

the [foregoing] communications that His Book is Arabic, and
He confirmed this by His disavowal—glorified be His praise—

Arabic [Q. XLI, 44]?

Shaft*! said: He [God] has made us cognizant of the
significance of His favors 11 by virtue of the [Prophet's] place
with which He has favored us. For He said:
There has come to you a messenger from among yourselves,
grievous to h im is your suffering, watchful h e is over you, and

with the believers, he is gentle and compassionate [Q. IX, 129].

And He said:
It is He who has raised up among the untutored people a mes­
senger from among them to recite to them His signs, and to
purify them, and to teach them the Book and the Wisdom,
though they were hitherto in manifest error [Q. LXII, 2].

Among those favors which [God] made His Prophet cog­
nizant of, is what He said [to him]:
It is assuredly a reminder to thee and thy people [Q. XLIII, 43].

Thus [God] has favored the [Prophet's] people by asso­
ciating their name with his name in His Book.
And He said:
And warn thy clan, thy nearest kin [Q. XXVI, 214].

And He said:
In order that thou mayest warn the Mother of the Towns and
those around it [Q. XLI I, 5].

The Mother of the Towns is Makka,12 the city [of the
11 Bulaq ed., p. 9.
All Muslim commentators are agreed that the Mother of Towns is
Makka. Richard Bell, however, suggests that it is probably Madina. See

His Book as a special [people] and included them among those
who were warned as a whole, and decreed that they were to
be warned in their Arabic tongue—the tongue of the [Prophet’s]
people in particular.
It is obligatory upon every Muslim to learn the Arab tongue
to the utmost of his power in order [to be able] to profess
through it that “ there is no God at all but God and Muham­
mad is His servant and Apostle," and to* recite in it [i. e., the
Arabic tongue] the Book of God, and to utter in mentioning
what is incumbent upon him, the takbir,13 and what is com­
S 48
manded, the tasbih,1* the tashahhud15 and others.
Whatever is additional of the language which God made to
be the language of him [Muhammad] by whom He sealed
His prophethood and by whom He revealed the last of His
Books—is for his [man’s] welfare, just as it is his [duty] to
learn [how] to pray and recite the d h ik r19 in it, to visit the
[Sacred] House17 and perform its duties, to turn [in prayer]
in the direction to which he should turn,18 and to be a fol­
lower [in the performance] of the duties imposed upon him or
8 49
recommended to him, [rather] than to be followed.
63.
Shaft*! said: 19 [The reason] I began to explain why the
Qur’an was communicated in the Arab tongue rather than in
another, is that no one who understands dearly the total
meanings of the [legal] knowledge of the Book of God would
be ignorant of the extensiveness of that tongue and of the
various meanings [of its words] to be found [just as] there
are various words for a certain meaning. Doubts which occur

to one who is ignorant of [the Arab tongue] will disappear
from him who knows it.
Calling the attention of the public to the fact that the
Qur’an was communicated in the Arab tongue in particular
is [a sincere piece of] advice to [all] Muslims. This advice is
a duty imposed upon them which must not be put aside and
is the attainment of a supererogatory act of goodness which
no one will neglect except him who makes himself foolish and
who abandons the field of good fortune. Included in faithful­
ness is that1the tru th 20 shall be explained to them. Both the
fulfilment of what is right and faithfulness to the Muslims are
[embodied in our obligation of] obedience to God. And
obedience to God embraces all good.
64. Shafi'i said: 21 Sulyan b. ‘Uyayna told us from Ziyad b.
‘Ilaqa; who said: I have heard Jarir b. ‘Abd-Allah saying: “ I
have paid homage to the Prophet that [I will be] faithful to
every M uslim ;'22
Ibn ‘Uyayna [also] told us from Suhay! b. Abi $alih from
*Ata* b. Yazld [al-Laythl] from Tamlm al-Darl, that the Prophet
said: “ Religion is faithfulness,” repeated three times. “ To
whom? ” the Prophet was asked.23 “ To God, to His Rook, to
His Prophet and to all the Muslims, their leaders and their
public,” he replied.24
65. Shafi*I said: God has addressed His Rook to the Arabs
in their tongue in accordance with the meanings known to
them. Included [in the words] “ in accordance with the
meanings they know ” was the extensiveness of their tongue.

general with the first part [of the phrase] not needing the
second. [Something] “ literally general ” means that [the con­
cept of] the particular is included in the general; that is
indicated by some [of the words] expressed. Also “ literally
general” means [only] what is particular, with the word B9
literally recognized in its context to mean what is not literally
so. Knowledge of all of this is to be found either in the begin­
ning of what is said or in the middle or at the end.
[The Arabs] may begin the subject of a speech whose first
word makes the last clear; and they may begin a speech whose
last word makes the first clear. And they may speak about
[a certain] subject, in which they indicate the meaning—just
as gestures indicate—without clarifying it with words. To them
this [kind of speech] is of the highest order which only their
learned understand, not those who are unlearned. They [also]
call [a certain] object by several names, and one word may
have several meanings.
All these [categories of] meanings which I have discussed
are known to the scholars, although the things they know may S52
vary: [some] having knowledge of some quite well, while others
are ignorant of that part of the [Arab] tongue—in which the
Book of God was communicated and the sunna uttered—are
unfamiliar with them. Whoever undertakes, therefore, to
speak in the language they [the Arabs] know, undertakes some­
thing part of which he does not know. And whoever was in
error without excuse whenever he spoke about something of
which his knowledge did not embrace the difference between
what was wrong and right.25
*s Since the Qur'an contains quite a few foreign words, the question
has often been raised whether these do not qualify the Arabic character
which the Qur’an stresses. There are two schools of thought concerning
this question. The early school,' whose best exponents were Ibn 'Abbas
(d. 68/687), leading authority in Makka, and Shafi’i, argued that although
the Arabic language was rich in its vocabulary, it was bound to .have
certain words in common with other languages. A later school of thought
maintained that foreign words had been adopted by the Arabs in an
early age, before the Q ur’an was communicated, and had become an
integral part of the Arabic language. Thus when the Qur'an was revealed
in “ the Arabic language,” those words had thready been Arabicized.

Which the Partictilar Is Included
66, Shafi'I said: 20 God, Blessed and Most High, said:
God is the creator of everything, and He of everything is a
guardian [Q. XXXIX, 63].

And [God], Blessed and Most High, said:
It is God who hath created the heavens and the earth [Q. XIV,
37].

And He said:
There is not a living creature 27 in the earth but God is responsi­
ble for its sustenance [Q. XI, 8].

These are examples of general declarations in which no
particular is included.
67. Shafi'i said: Everything, including the heaven and the
earth, things having living spirit, trees and the like—God has
created them all. And God is responsible for the sustenance
of every living creature and He knows its lodging place and
its repository.28
And God said:
It is not for the people of Madina or for the Beduin round about
them to tarry behind the Apostle of God or to prefer their own
lives to his [Q. IX, 121].
Al-ShafibI (d. 790/1388) argues (that there is no question that the Qur’an
contains foreign words but that, generally speaking, the Book was com­
municated in the Arabic language and that it cannot be understood save
in the way the Arabic language is understood. See al-Shatibl, Vol. I, pp.
64-66; al-Ghazzili, Vol. I, p. 68; al-Suyup, al-ltqan Ft Ulum al-Qur’dn

The meaning implied in this communication is like the
previous one; it specifies those men who [take part] in the
jihad, whether they are able to fulfil the jihad [duty] or not,
and that none should put himself before the Prophet. There
is in this communication a general as well as a particular
[declaration].
And [God] said:
And the oppressed—men, women and children—who say: Our
Lord, take us out of this city of wrong-doing people [Q. IV, 77].

S 54

In the same [category] falls God’s saying:
So . . * until when the two of them came to the people of a city,
they asked the people for food, but they refused to receive them

hospitably [Q. XVIII, 76].
There is an indication in this communication that not all
the people of the town were asked for food. So this com­
munication has the same meaning [as the preceding one].
Moreover, there is in it as well as in [the communication
concerning] the “ city of wrong-doing people,” a particular
[declaration], since not all the people of the town were wrong­
doing; there lived among them Muslims [too], but they were
a few among many others.
There are [several] other examples in the Qur’an, but these
are sufficient, I trust; and there are examples in the sunna
cited in their proper places [of this book].

As todhe general, it is in God’s saying:
We have created you male and female and made you! peoples and
tribes, that you may know one another [Q. XLIX, 13].

For all souls addressed by this communication, whether in
the time of the Prophet or before or after him, were created
male or female, and [made] peoples and tribes.
The particular may be found in God’s saying:
The noblest among you in the sight of God is the most God­
fearing [Q. XLIX, 13].

For fear of God is obligatory on [the person] who can com­
prehend it and who belongs to those who are mature of the
descendants of Adam, excluding the beasts, the lunatics and
children who have not yet come of age, including those who
can comprehend ..what fear of God means.
No one should be regarded as god-fearing—or not god­
fearing—unless he is capable of comprehending [its meaning]
and belongs to [the class of] God-fearing people; if he acts
contrary to it, he belongs to another'class. T he Book as well
as the sunna bear witness to what-1 have:discussed. For the
Prophet said:

the same [category]: They are obligatory upon the mature and

mature but insane—and menstruam women during the period
of menstruation.

The Explicit General Declaration of the
Book Intended To Be All Particular
70. Shafi'i said: 81 God, Blessed and Most High, said:
Those to whom the people said: ' The people [i. e., the enemy]
have gathered against you, so be afraid of them/ But it increased
them in faith, and they said: *It is on God that we count, and a
good guardian is He ’ [Q. Ill, 167].

71. Shafi’i said: Since there were with the Apostle people
other than those who gathered against them [i; e., his people],
and those who informed [his people] were people other than
those who gathered or were with him—these [also] were certain
people—the evidence!of the Qur’a n 32 is, therefore, clear from
what I have stated that [the Prophet] has gathered for them
certain people, excluding others.
[Legal] knowledge conveys certainty that the whole people
did not gather against them, nor inform them, nor were they
[i. e., the informed] the whole of the people^
Since the term “ people ” may either be applied to [a mini­
mum of] three persons or to all the people or to any number
between three and all, it is correct in the Arab tongue to say
34 This tradition was transmitted on the authority of 'A’isha and ’All.
For the transmission from ’A’isha, see Abu Dawud, Vol. IV, pp. 140-41;
and for the transmission from 'All, see Ibn Hanbal, Vol. II, pp. 188, 197,

that " those to whom the people said *\ may constitute [only]
four persons, and that *' the people who have gathered against
you,” are those who have departed, from [the battle of] Uljud.88
Yet these are not too many people [despite the fact that]
those who gathered are different from those who gathered
against, and those who informed are different from both. But
the greater number of the people are those [who remained] in
their towns who are other than those people who gathered,
those who gathered against and those who informed.
72, [Shaft*?] said: And He [God] said:
O ye people, a parable is coined, so listen to it: Verily those to
whom you pray, apart from God, will not create a fly, even if
they were to join together to do it; and if a fly were to snatch
anything from them, they would never rescue it from him. Feeble
indeed are the beseecher and the besought [Q. XXII, 72].

T h e 44 meaning commonly implied by this word [i.e., people]
is general, applying to all people. But it is clear to those learned
in the Arab tongue that the meaning implied [here] is some
of the people, excluding others. For no other [people] were
addressed by this communication except those who worship
other gods than God—exalted be He over what they say—since
there are among them believers who are lunatics and minors
who do not worship [other] gods than Him.
75.
[Shafi‘1] said: The meaning implied in this text falls in
the same category as the foregoing one, according to those who
are learned in the Arab tongue; but the former seems to be
clearer to persons who are not among the learned, owing to
several [clear] indications in it.
74. Shaft*! said: God, Blessed.and Most High, said:
Then pour forth from where the people have poured forth [Q.
II, 195].
**The people who gathered against the l- phet were the Makkam,
who fought Muhammad at the battle of Uhud in 5/625. See T abari’i

It is certain that not all the people had been present at
*Arafa 25 in the time of the Apostle, and that it was [only] the
Apostle and those who had been with him were those to whom
this communication was addressed. But it is correct in the
Arab tongue to say: “ Pour forth from where the people have
poured forth,” meaning [only] some of the people,

75, Shafi'i said:36 The meaning of this communication falls
in the same category as the two foregoing ones, and is so
regarded by the Arabs. The first communication is clearer
than the second to those who are ignorant of the Arab tongue,
and the second is clearer to them than the third; but to the
Arabs there is no difference in clarity among the three, since
the one possessing the least clarity is as adequate [for compre­
hension] as the one that is clearest to them. For the one who
listens wants only to comprehend the [meaning of the] saying
of one who speaks: the least [meaning] that makes him com­
prehend would be sufficient.
76. [Shafi'i said]: God, glorious be His praise, said:
People and stones 37 are its fuel [Q. II, 22].

The Book of God indicates that [only] some of the people
would be the fuel, in accordance with God’s saying:
Verily those to whom the best [reward] has already [been decreed]
by us—they from it will be far removed [Q. XXI, 101].

77. Shafi'I said:38 God, Blessed and Most High, said:
And ask them about the town which was bordering the sea, when
its inhabitants transgressed the sabbath. Their fish came to them
on the day of their sabbath, right to the shore, but on the day
when they did not keep sabbath, they did not come to them.
Thus were we trying them for their ungodliness [Q. VII, 163].

[God], glorious be His praise, has at first mentioned the
subject concerning the town that was bordering the sea; but
when He stated “ they transgressed the sabbath,” He obviously
meant the people of the town, since the town [itself] can
neither transgress nor deviate from the sabbath or other
[matters]. Thus by transgression [God] meant the people of
the town whom He tried for their violation [of the Sabbath].
And He said:
How many a town which was doing wrong have We broken up,
and set up after it another people. When they sensed Our power,
there they were from it ru n n in g [Q. XXI, 31-12]:

The meaning implied in this communication falls in the
same category as the previous one. [God] mentioned the town
which was broken up, but when He said it was doing wrong,
it is evident that those who were doing wrong were only the
people [of the town], not the houses, which [obviously] have
nothing to do with wrongdoing. And when [God] mentioned
the people who were established after its destruction and their
sense of power of Our [i. e., God’s] attack, it is [quite] certain
that he who can sense [Our] power can only be a human being
who knows what power is.

God, Blessed and Most High, citing the saying o£
Joseph's brothers to their father, said:
We testify only to what we know, and against the unseen we
could not guard. Ask the town in which we have been, and the
caravan with which we have come; verily we speak the truth
[Q. XII, 81-82].

[The meaning of] this communication [falls in the same
category] as the previous one, on which, those learned in the

[Arab] tongue do not disagree, that [Joseph's brothers] spoke
to their father about a matter which touches the people of
the town and those of the caravan, since the town and the
caravan [by themselves] dinnot tell what the truth was.

General [Declaration] Which the Simna'Specifically
Indicates Is Meant To Be Particular
79. God, glorious be His praise, said:
And his parents each receive a sixth of what he has left, if he
has children; but if he has no children and his heirs are his
parents, then his mother receives a third; if, however, he has
brothers, liis mother receives a sixth [Q. IV, 12].

And He said:
And half of what your wives leave belongs to you if they have
no children; but if they have children, a fourth of what they
have belongs to you, after any bequests may have been made or
debts [have been paid]. . . . To them belongs a fourth of what
you leave, if you have no children; if you have children, an eighth
of what you leave belongs to them, after any bequests you may
have made or debts [have’1been paid]. If a man—or a woman—
whose property is inherited has no direct heirs, but has a brother

or a sister, each of the w o receives a sixth; if they be more than
that, they share in a third, after any bequests you may have made
or debts [have been paid], without prejudice one to the other;
a charge from God; verily God is knowing, gracious [Q. IV, IS,

15-16].
Thus, [God] made it plain that fathers and wives are among
those He named in various circumstances, the terms being
general; but the sunna of the Prophet indicated that this is
intended to mean only some fathers and wives, excluding
others, provided that the religion of the fathers, children and
wives is the same [i. e. Islam] and that each heir is neither a
killer nor a slave.38
80. And He said;
After any bequests he may have made or debts [have been paid]

[Q. IV, 15].
The Prophet made it clear that bequests must not exceed
one third [of the deceased’s estate], and the heirs receive the
two-thirds; and he [also] made it clear that debts take prece­
dence over bequests and inheritance and that neither the be­
quest nor the inheritance [should be distributed] until the
creditors are [first] paid.40
Thus if it were not for the evidence of the sunna and the
consensus of the people, there would be no inheritance until
after the bequest [was paid] and the bequest would not fail
to take precedence over the debt, or be on equal footing with
the debt.
81. And God said:
When you stand up for Prayer, wash your faces and your hands
up to the elbows, and wipe your heads, and your feet up to tire
ankles [Q. V, 8],

[God], glorious be His praise, meant that the feet are in­
tended to be washed [in the same manner] as the face and the
hands. T he literal meaning of this communication is that the

feet, w a s n o t all—but [only] s o m e —of t h o s e w h o perform
th e [ d u t y of] a b l u t i o n . 41
Since the Apostle [himself] wiped his shoes and ordered
those who wore their shoes in a state of purification to do so,
the sunna of the Apostle indicated that [the duty of] the
washing or the wiping of the feet meant that [it was obliga­
tory on] some of those who [perform] the duty of ablution,
not others.
82. God, Blessed and Most High, said:

The Apostle decreed that “ Hands should [neither be] cut
off [for the stealing] of fruits nor the spadix of a palm tree,
and that the hand [of the thief] should not be cut off unless
the price of the [thing] stolen is a quarter of a dinar or
more.” 49
83. And God said:
The fornicatress and the fornicator—scourge each of them with a
hundred stripes [Q. XXIV, 2].

And He [God], concerning slave-women, said:

stripes is intended [only] for the free, not the slave-women. And
when the Apostle stoned rather than scourged the thayyib45
adulterer, the sunna of the Prophet specified that the hundred
stripes are [the penalty] for the free fornicatress and forni­
cator; and that the cuting off of the hand of the thief was
intended to be [the penalty] for one who steals [a thing] from
a secure place 46 and that the price [of the theft] should be
[at least] a quarter of a dinar, excluding other things covered
under the terms " theft ” and “ adultery.”
84. Cod said:

Hashim and the Banu al-Muttalib the portion of the share
belonging to " th e near of kin," 47 the sunna of the Apostle
gave evidence that the “ near of kin "—whom God made par­
takers of the one-fifth share—were the Banu Hashim and the
Banu al-Mut{alib, not others.
Indeed the whole [tribe] of Quraysh is related [to the
Prophet], The [clan of the] Banu *Abd Shams is related [to
the Prophet] equally with the [dan of the] Banu al-Muttalib,
for they were all the descendants of the same father and
mother, although some members of the Banu al-Muttalib were
distinguished by having been descendants from the Banu
Hashim [too], in distinction from others.48
Since the portion of the share [belonging to the near of kin]
44The thayyib is a woman who is not a virgin, or a woman whom a
man has gone into, or a woman who has become separated from her hus­
band in any manner (by death or divorce).

44 I. e., the thing which is well protected, not liable to be picked up
by people. See a tradition to this effect in Abu Dawud, Vol. IV, p. 158.
47The term qurba, literally meaning “ way of approach to God," refers
in this Quranic verse, as Shafi'i points out, to the Banu Hashim and- the
Banu al-Muttalili See Baydawt, pp. 240-41.
44 For a study of the Prophet’s family relationship with other clans,

was not given to all who belonged to the Banu al-Mut^alib,
excluding those whose descent from the Banu Hashim did not
give them a portion of the share, this indicated that they [the
Banu Hashim] obtained a special portion which others did
not, only because of their relationship to the stock of [the
prophet], although they supported the Prophet—as they always
did—when they entered into his pass (shi'b) .49 Yet, God,
glorious be His praise, did not specify [anything] special for
them.
Most certainly [the clan of] the Banu Hashim belonged
to the [tribe of] Quraysh, but none of them was given a share
from the one*fifth on account of their descent. The Banu
Nawfal [enjoyed] the same [blood] relationship, although they
were distinguished on the grounds of their descent from a
different mother.
85. [Shafi‘1 said]: God said:

S 69

And know that if you take anything as spoil, one-fifth belongs
to God and to the Apostle [O. VIII, 42].
Since the Apostle decreed that the booty belongs to the
slayer in an attack, the sunna of the Prophet indicated that
the spoil, which is subject to the [deduction of the] one-fifth
share provided in the Qur'an, is different from booty, provided
that the booty was taken in a battle of attack, in distinction
from booty taken otherwise. But the booty taken in [fighting]
other than an attack is subject to the one-fifth share in accordance with the sunna, ini the same manner as other spoils.80
Had it not been for the evidence of the sunna and our
decision on the [basis of the] literal [meaning of the Qur’dn],
we should have been in favor of punishing everyone to whom
the term stealing applies by the cutting off [of the hand]; and
49This is a reference to the counter-alliance of the clans of the Band
Hashim and the Banu *Abd al-Muttalib against the boycott of the tribe
of Quraysh and its attempt to force the Prophet and his followers to
abandon Islam. See Ibn Hisham, Vol. I, pp. 230-34. Guillaume, in his
translation of Ibn Hisham's Life of Muhammad, uses “ alley ” for shi'b,
p. 159.

of scourging every free thayyib adulterer with a hundred
stripes; and of giving the share of the near of kin to everyone
related to the Prophet—which might have been extended to
many sections of the Arabs, owing to the [Prophet’s] blood
relationship with them—and of regarding the booty subject to
the one-fifth [rule] in the same manner as a spoil, by treating
it like other spoils.

[ON THE OBLIGATION OF MAN
TO ACCEPT THE AUTHORITY
OF THE PROPHET]
A Declaration Concerning the Duty
Imposed by God, as Laid Down in
His Book, [Ordering Men] To Follow
jthe Prophet's Sunna

86.
Shafii said: God has placed His Apostle—[in rela­
tion to] His religion, His commands and His Book—in the
position made clear by Him as a distinguishing standard of
His religion by imposing the duty of obedience to Him as
well as prohibiting disobedience to Him. He has made His
merits evident by associating belief in His Apostle with the
belief in Him. For God, Blessed and Most High, said:
So believe in God and His Apostles, and do not say: “ Three."
Refrain; [it will be] better for you. God is only one God. Glory
be to Him. His having a son is something alien to him [Q. IV,
169].

And He said:
The believers are only those who have believed in God and His
Apostle, and who when they are with him on some common affair
do not go away until they ask his permission [Q. XXIV, 62].

109

S73

110

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

Thus [God] prescribed that the perfect beginning of the
faith, to which all other things are subordinate, shall be the
belief in Him and then in His Apostle. For if a person
believes only in Him, not in His Apostle, the name of the
perfect faith 1 will never apply to him until lie believes ir\
His Apostle together with Him.8
So the Apostle laid down the sunna [of reciting the Prophet’s
name together with that of God] for testing the faith of every
man [as the following tradition indicates]:
Malik b. Anas told us from Hilal b, Usama from *Ata‘ b.
Yasar from ‘Umar b. al-Hakam, who said:
I went to the Apostle of God with a slave-girl and I asked him:
‘ I have taken an oath [to free a slave]; may I free her? * ‘ Where
is God?’ the Apostle asked her. 'I n heaven,’ she answered.
‘ And who am I ? " asked he. *You are the Apostle of God,’
she answered. ‘ You may free her/ [the Prophet] said.8

[The transmitter’s name, ‘Umar b. al-Hakdm]—Shafi'I says—
should read Mu'awiya b. al-Hakam, for Malik, I believe, has
not correctly reported the name, as others did.
87.
Shafi'I said: God has imposed the duty on men to obey
His divine communications as well as the sunna of His Apos­
tle. Fdr He said in His Book:
-O our Lord, raise up amongst them an Apostle, one of them­
selves, to recite to them Thy signs and to teach them the Book
and Wisdom and to purify them. Verily Thou art All-mighty,
All-wise [Q. II, 123].

And He, glorious be His praise, said:
And also we have sent among you an Apostle, one of yourselves,
to recite to you our signs, and purify you, to teach you the Book
and the Wisdom, and to teach you what you did not know [Q.
II, 146].
* 1, e., Islam.
*Cf. Tabari, Tafsir, Vol. IX, pp. 422-23;. Baydawi, pp. 137-38, 474-75.
* Malik. Vol. II, pp. 776-77.

And He said:
God bestowed a favor upon the believers when He raised up
amongst them ah Apostle, one of themselves, to recite His signs
to them, to purify them and to teach them the Book, although
they had formerly been in manifest error [Q. Ill, 158].
And He, glorious be His praise, said:
It is He who has raised up an Apostle among the untutored
people, one of their number to recite to them His signs, to purify
them, and to teach them the Book and the Wisdom, though
formerly they had been in manifest error [Q. LX1I, 2].
And He said:
But remember the goodness which God has shown you and how
much of the Book and the Wisdom He has sent down to you to
admonish you thereby [Q. II, 231].
And He said:
God has sent down to thee the Book and the Wisdom, and has
taught thee what thou did not know before; the bounty of God
towards thee is ever great [Q. IV, 113].
And He said:
And call to mind the signs of God and the Wisdom which are
recited in your houses; verily God is gentle, well-informed [Q.
XXXIII, 34].
So God mentioned His Book—which is the Qur’an—and
Wisdom, and I have heard that those who are learned in the
Qur’an—whom I approve—hold that Wisdom is the sunna of
the Apostle of God. This is like what [God Himself] said;
but God knows best! For the Qur’an is mentioned [first],
followed by Wisdom; [then] God mentioned His "favor to
mankind by teaching them the Qur’an and Wisdom. So it is
not permissible for Wisdom to be called here [anything] save
the sunna of the Apostle of God. For [Wisdom] is closely
linked to the Book of God, and God has imposed the duty of
obedience to His Apostle, and imposed on men the obliga-

lion to obey his orders.4 So it is riot permissible to regard
anything as a duty save that set forth in the Qur’an and the
sunna of His Apostle. For [God], as we have [just] stated,
prescribed that the belief in His Apostle shall be associated
with the belief in Him.
The sunna of the Apostle makes evident what God meant
[in the text of His Book], indicating His general and particu­
lar [commands]. He associated the Wisdom [embodied] in the
sunna with his Book, but made it subordinate [to the Book].
Never has God done this for any of His creatures save His
Apostle.

God’s Command Ordering Obedience to
the Apostle Is Both Associated with
Obedience to Him and Ordered Independently
88. [Shafi'i said]: God said:
When God and His Apostle have decreed a matter, it is not for
a believing man or a woman to exercise a choice in a matter
affecting him; whoever opposes God and His Apostle has deviated
into manifest error [Q. XXXIII, 36].
And He said:
O you who believe, obey God and obey the Apostle and those
in authority among you. If you should quarrel about anything,
refer it to God and the Apostle, if you believe in God and the
Last Day. That is better and fairer in the issue [Q. IV, 62],
Some scholars have held that " those in authority " [means]
the commanders of the Apostle’s army. T hat is what more
than one commentator has told us. But God knows best.5
This is in accord with what [God] said, for the Arabs who
* See paragraph 22, above.

* T abari adds that it may mean the leaders in m atters o f religion and
law. See T abari, T a fs ir , Vol. V III, pp. 495-504; Baydawl, p. 115.

had been around Makka knew nothing about command, and
[the idea of] some submitting to the command of others was
repugnant to them.
When, however, they submitted to [the authority of] the
Apostle, they did not think that [such an authority] was fit
to reside in any hands other than the Apostle’s.
So they were commanded to obey “ those in authority
the ones whom the Apostle appointed, with conditional but
not absolute obedience, concerning their rights and duties.
However, [God] said: “ If you should quarrel about anything,
refer it to God,” that is, in the event of disagreement.
89.
Shafi'i said: 6 This [i. e., the meaning implied in the
latter command] is, if God will, as He said about “ those in
authority,” namely, that “ If you should quarrel ” (but God
knows best), they [the people] and the commander whom they
were ordered to obey—should “ refer it to God and the Apos­
tle ” for a settlement on the basis of what God and His Apostle
said, if they know it. If you do not know what God’s com­ SSO
mands are, you should ask the Apostle, if you are able to reach
him,7 or any one of you who is able to do so. For this is an
obligation concerning which there should be no disagreement,
in accordance with God’s saying:
When God and His Apostle have decreed a certain matter, it is
not for a believing man or a woman to have a choice in a matter
affecting him [Q. XXXIII, 36].«
As to the disputes that happened after the Apostle’s [death],
the matter was decided in accordance with God’s judgment
[as laid down in the Qur’an] and then that of His Apostle
[as laid down in the sunna]. But if a text were not applicable,
the matter was decided by analogy on the strength of a prece­
dent sought [either in the Q ur’an or the sunna] in the same
manner as I have [already] explained concerning the qibla,

[witnesses of] just character, equal compensation, and what­
ever God has prescribed in parallel cases. For He said:

the veracious and the martyrs and the upright upon whom God
has bestowed favor. Good company are these [Q. IV, 71].

And He said:
O you who have believed, obey God and His Apostle [Q. VIII, 20].

God s Command Ordering Obedience
to His Apostle
90. [Shaft*! said]: God, glorious be His praise, said:
Verily, those who swear allegiance to thee swear allegiance really
to God; the hand of God is above their hands. So whoever breaks
his oath, breaks it only to his own hurt, and to him who fulfils
what he has pledged to God, He will grant a great reward [Q.
XLVIII, 10].
And He said:
Whoever obeys the Apostle has obeyed God [Q. IV, 82].
So God instructed [men] that their homage to the Apostle
is homage to Him, and their obedience [to him] is obedience
to Him.
And He said:
But no! by thy Lord, they will not become believers until they
make thee judge in their disputes and do not afterwards find
difficulty in Thy decisions, but surrender in full submission [Q.
IV, 68].
This verse, we have been told, was revealed in connection
with-a land dispute between al-Zubayr and another man in
which the Prophet gave a decision in favor of al-Zubayr. This

decision is a sunna laid down by the Apostle, not a command
in the text of the Qur’an.9
The Qur’an indicates what I have just stated; for if this
decision were a Quranic decision, it should have been presc rib e d in the text of the Book of God.
But if men fail to accept a decision based on a clear text
of the Book of God, they undoubtedly cease to be believers,
for they are rejecting a decision based on divine legislation.
For God, Blessed and Most High, said:
Bo not put the Apostle’s calling on you for aid on the same
footing amongst you as your calling on each other. God knows
those of you who slip away secretly, so let those who go against
His command beware lest a trial befall them, or a painful punish­
ment [Q- XXIV, 63].
And He said:
When they are called to God and to His Apostle that he may
judge between them, lo, a party of them avert themselves. But
if they are in the right, they will come to him in submission.
Is there sickness in their hearts, or are they in doubt, or do
they fear that God and His Apostle may act unjustly towards
them. Nay, but they are the evildoers.
All that the believers said when they were called to God and
His Apostle that he'might judge between them was: ‘We hear
and obey.’ These are the ones who prosper.
Whoever obeys God and His Apostle, and fears God and shows
piety—these are the ones who attain felicity [Q. XXIV, 47*51].
* Yahya b; Adam, in Kitab al-Kharaj, reports the case as follows: “ O ne
of the Helpers from am ong th e Banu Vmayya had a dispute with alZubayr concerning a creek (sharj) in the harra, and the P rophet said:
Irrigate, O Zubayr, and then leave the w ater alone. Said the m an of th e

Through this communication, God' instructed men thattheir recourse to the Apostle to judge among them is a recourse
to God’s judgment, for the Apostle is the judge among them,
and when they accept his judgment they do so only because
of an obligation imposed by God.
And He instructed them that the [Prophet’s] judgment is
His judgment, for his judgment is imposed, by Him and by
His established knowledge—rendering him a man of destiny
and assisting him by preserving him from error and [worldly]
success—and by testifying that He guides him and causes him
to obey His order.
So God imposed the obligation upon His creatures to obey
His Apostle, and He instructed them that [obedience] to him
is obedience to Him.
The sum-total of what He instructed them is the duty to
obey Him and His Apostle, and that obedience to the Apostle
is obedience to Him. He [also] instructed them that He im­
posed the duty on His Apostle to obey His order, Glorious
be His praise.

And He said:
Then we set thee upon an open way of the Law; therefore follow

So God instructed His Apostle that He has favored «him

from mankind, for He said:
O thou Apostle, proclaim what is sent down to thee from thy
Lord—if thou dc it not thou hast not delivered His message—and
God will defend thee from the people [Q. V, 71].10
92. Shafi'i said:11 And [He], glorious be His praise, certi­

and in Guidance to himself and to whoever follows him. For
He said:
Thus We have revealed to thee a spirit belonging to Our affair.
Thou didst not know what either the Book or the Faith were.
But We have made it a light by which We guide whoever We
please of Our servants, and verily thou shalt guide unto a straight

Thus God declared that He commanded His Prophet to
obey His order, and certified what he proclaimed on His
behalf as well as what he certified for himself.12 We [also]
certify for him in order to draw near to God by our belief in
Him, and we make entreaties to Him by belief in His words.
[For]‘Abd al-’Aziz [b. Muhammad al-Darawardi] told us from
‘Arar b. Abi *Amr—the freed slave of al-Muttalib—from ah
Muttalib b. Han^ab that the Apostle of God said:
I have left nothing concerning which God has given you an order
without giving you that order; nor have 1 neglected anything
concerning which He has given you a prohibition without giving
you that prohibition18
93. Shafi'I said: What God has informed us of in His estab­
lished knowledge and in His final and irrevocable judgment—
a favor and a blessing from Him—is that He prevented those
who attempted to lead [the Prophet] astray, and informed him
that they could not hurt him at all.
In certifying that [the Prophet] guides mankind along a
straight-forward path—the path of God—and that he delivers
His message and obeys His commands—as we have stated
before—and in ordering obedience to him and in emphasizing
all [of this] in the [divine] communications just cited—God
has given evidence to mankind that they should accept the
judgment of the Apostle and obey his orders.

For the Apostle has laid down a sunna [on matters] for
which there is a text in the Book of God as well as for others
concerning which there is no [specific] text. But whatever he
laid down in the sunna God has ordered us to obey, and He
regards [our] obedience to him as obedience to Him, and [our]
refusal to obey him as disobedience to Him for which no man
will be forgiven; nor is an excuse for failure to obey the
Apostle’s sunna possible owing to what I have already stated
and to what the Apostle [himself] has said:
Sufyan [b. *Uyayna] told us from Salim Abu al-Nadr—a freed

the Apostle laid down [a similar sunna] In conformity with
divine communication. Second, for any [ambiguous] command
the Apostle laid down on God’s behalf [a sunna] clarifying
the meaning implied by God and specifying what [kind of]
duty God imposed, whether general or particular, and how
man should carry it out. In both categories [the Prophet]
followed the Book of God.
96. [Shafii] said: I know of no scholar who does not agree
that the sunna of the Prophet falls in three categories, two of
which were agreed upon unanimously. These two categories
agree [on certain matters] and differ [on others].
First, for whatever acts there is textual [legislation] provided
by God in the Book, the Apostle [merely] specified clearly
what is in the text of the Book. Second, as to any [ambiguous]
communication in the Book laid down by God, [the Prophet]
specified the meaning implied by Him. These are the two
categories on which scholars do not disagree.
The third category consists of what the Apostle has laid
down in the sunna and concerning which there is no text in
the Book.
97. Some [scholars] have said: God empowered [the
Prophet], by virtue of the duty He imposed [on mankind] to
obey Him and his success in obtaining [God's] approval in
accordance with His established knowledge, to provide sunnas
[for matters] on which there is no text in the Book. Others
said: No sunna was ever laid down [by the Prophet) unless
there was a basis1T for it in the Book, such as the sunna which
specified the number of prayers [each day] and [the modes of]
their performance, based on the general duty of prayer. In
like manner, [the Prophet] laid down sunnas dealing with sale
[of property], as well as others. For God said:
Do not consume your property among you uselessly [Q. IV, 33].
And He said:
God has permitted sale and forbidden usury-[Q<-I1» 277].

Whatever God has provided by [way of] permission or proliibition, he has specified on God’s behalf as he did in [the
case of the duty of] ,prayer.
Others said: [The Prophet] received a message from God
confirming the sunna by a command from Him.
Still others said: [The Prophet] was inspired with all that
he had laid down. The sunna is [divine] Wisdom inspired by
God, and so whatever He inspired him with [constitutes] sunna.
[For] ‘Abd al-*Aziz [b. Muhammad al*Darawardi] told us from

Shaft'! said:18 Among the things with which [the
Prophet] was inspired is his sunna. This [sunna] is the Wisdom
which God mentioned [in His Book], and whatever He sent
down to him is a Book—the Book of God—all of these have
been given to him as favors from God and by His will. These
favors are either embodied in one Favor20 or take different 894-102
forms. We pray God for protection from error and success.
In whatever form it may take, God made it clear that He
imposed the duty of obedience to His Apostle, and has given
none of mankind an excuse to reject any order he knows to
be the order of the Apostle of God. God has rather made
men have need for him in [all matters ofj religion and He
has given the proof for it by providing that the sunna of the
Apostle make clear the meanings, of the duties laid down in
His Book, so that it might be known that the sunna—whether
in the form specifying the meaning of God's commands as
provided in the text of the Book which they can read or in
the form of legislation in the aosence of such a text—in either
form represents God’s command and is in [full] agreement 8104

[ON THE ABROGATION OF

The Abrogating and Abrogated [Communications]

Shaft'! said: God indeed created mankind for
whatever His established knowledge desired in creating it and
for whatever [its destiny] should be. There is no reversal at
all of His judgment, He being swift of reckoning.1 And he
revealed to them the Book that explains everything, as a guide b 16
and a mercy.2 In it He laid down some duties which He con­
firmed, and others which He abrogated, as a mercy to His
people so as to lighten their burden and to comfort them in
addition to the favors which He had begun to bestow upon
them. For the fulfilment [of the duties] He confirmed, He
rewarded them with Paradise and with salvation from His
punishment. His mercy has included all of them in what He
confirmed and what He abrogated. Praise be to Him for His
favors.
101.
Shaft'! said:3 God has declared that He abrogated
[communications] of the Book only by means of other com­
munications in it; that the sunna cannot abrogate [a text in]
the Book but that it should only follow what is laid down in

the Book, and that the sunna is intended to explain the
meaning of communications of general [nature] set forth [in
the Book]. For God said:
When Our signs are recited to them as Evidences, those who do
not look forward to meeting us, say: Bring a Scripture other than
this or change it. [You O Muhammad] say: It is not for me to
change it of my own accord; I only follow what is revealed to me;
verily I fear, if I go against my Lord, the punishment of a mighty
day [Q. X, 16-17],

Thus God informed [men] that He had commanded His
Prophet to obey what was communicated to him, but that He
did not empower him to alter [the Book] of his own accord.
For there is in His saying: “ It is not for me to alter it of my
own accord " [Q. X, 16], an evidence for what I stated, that
nothing can abrogate the Book of God save His Book. Since
[God] is the originator of His [own] commands, He [alone]
can repeal or confirm whatever of it He wills—glorious be His
praise—but no one of His creatures may do so. For He also
said: “ God repeals what He wills, or confirms; with Him is
the Mother of the Book ” [Q. XIII, 39].*
Some scholars have maintained (but God knows best) that
there is in this communication an evidence that God has em­
powered His Apostle to set forth rules by [God-given] aid
[for matters] on which He provided no communications in
the Book. But God knows best.®
It is held that [God's] saying: **God will repeal what He
‘ T he Mother of the Book is the original copy of the Q ur’an which
exists or co-exists with God in Heaven (See Baydawi, p. 334). “ The
original of the Qur'&n,” says Bell, " is thought of as a book preserved in
(the seventh) heaven in the presence of God This is assumed to be what
is meant by the preserved tablet, lawh* mahfuz, spoken of in Q. LXXXV,
22. Sometimes it is thought of as having been sent down to the nearest
heaven on the night of power, lailat al-qadr, described in Q. XCVII, so
as to be available for revelation to the Prophet by the angel Gabriel ’*

wills/’ means that He repeals and confirms the duties which
pje wills. This resembles [the meaning in] the foregoing
[statement]; but God knows best. However, the evidence
a g a i n s t it is in the Book of God, in which He s a i d :

S107

For whatever We abrogate or cast into oblivion to forget, We
bring a better or the like of it. Knowest thou not that God is
powerful over everything? [Q. II. 100].

Thus God has informed men that the abrogation or the
deferment of any communication cannot be made valid save
by another [Quranic] communication. For He said:
When we substitute one communication for another—God knoweth
best what He sendeth down—they say: ‘ Thou '[Muhammad] art
only a forger* [Q. XVI, 103].e

In like manner the sunna of the Apostle of God states:
Nothing can abrogate it except [another] sunna of the Apostle.
If God were to address to His Apostle [a communication] on
a matter on which he [Muhammad] had provided a sunna
different from what God had addressed to him, he [Muham­
mad] would provide a sunna in conformity with whatever
God had communicated to him, so that he would make clear
to men that he had provided a* sunna that abrogated one
earlier or contrary to it. This is [well] stated in the sunna
[of the. Prophet], God’s blessing and peace be upon him.7
102. Someone may ask: The evidence that a Quranic [com­
munication] can abrogate another [of equal status], may be
found in the Qur'an itself, because there is nothing at all to
match the Qur’an; however, can you find such [an evidence]
in the sunna [concerning its abrogation by another sunna]?
103. Shaft'! replied: The evidence lies in my [earlier] state* For the significance of this communication as an evidence that God
permitted the repeal of His commands by others, see Abu Ja'far al-Nahhas,

ment concerning God's commands ordering men to obey the
order of the Apostle that the sunna was accepted [as emanating]
from God and that he who obeys it does so by [an order in]
the Book of God.8 For there is no other textual order which
God has made obligatory upon mankind save that which is in
His Book and in the sunna of His Piophet. If the sunna is
taken as such, that nothing else,by a human being is equal
to it, nothing can [therefore] abrogate it save another of equal
status. Nothing is equal [to the sunna] save the sun^a of the
Apostle, since God has never given to any other humkn being
[the power] He gave [to the Prophet]. He commanded men
to obey him and made his orders binding upon them. Thus
all men are his followers: He who follows shall never disobey
what he was ordered to obey, and he who is under obligation
to obey the sunna of the Apostle shall not refuse to obey it,
for he is not empowered to abrogate any part of it.
104. Someone may ask: Is it possible to assume that there
was a transmitted sunna which was abrogated.while the abro­
gating sunna was not transmitted?
105. [Shafi'I ^replied]: That is impossible. For how could
the transmitted sunna be possibly abrogated while the one
which is binding was abandoned? Were this permissible
the whole sunna might be abandoned by men, for they would
[then] say: “ Perhaps it was abrogated.” No duty has ever
been abrogated unless it was replaced by another. The abroga­
tion of the qibla [i. e., prayer in the direction] of Jerusalem by
another [in the direction] of the Ka'ba is a case in point. For
whatever has been abrogated in the Book or in the sunna
must have been [replaced by] something else.
106. Someone may ask: Can the sunna be abrogated by the
Qur’an?
107. [Shafii] replied: If a sunna were abrogated by the
Qur’an, another sunna must have been laid down by the
Prophet making clear that his earlier sunna was abrogated
so as to demonstrate to men that an act can be abrogated only
by something of equal status.

]08. He may ask; Where does the evidence lie for your
opinion?
109.
[Shaft*! replied]: [The evidence lies] in what I have
discussed in this book in its [proper] place, where it was made
clear that the duties imposed by God—[both] the general' and
the particular—implied that [the Prophet] makes no pro­
nouncement unless it is based on God's command. If God
abrogates any of His commands, the Apostle would also have
to abrogate his sunn a by another [in conformity with God's
new command].
Were it permissible to hold that what the Apostle has laid
down in the sunna was abrogated by the Qur’an and that he
has transmitted no abrogating sunna, it would be permissible B 17
to hold a similar view concerning the [tradition relating to]
the prohibition of all kinds of sale [of property], by holding
that [the Prophet] had prohibited them before [God] had laid
down [the rule] that " God has permitted sale and forbidden
usury ” [Q. II, 276]. The same might be held about [the tradi­
tion concerning] the stoning of adulterers, namely, that stoning
may be regarded as abrogated in accordance with God’s saying:
“ The fornicatress and the fornicator—scourge each one of
them with a hundred stripes/' [Q. XXIV, 2] and that [the B ill
tradition concerning] the wiping of the shoes may also be
regarded as abrogated by the communication*of ablution. It
would also be possible to hold that the cutting off of the hand
of the thief should not be dropped even if the stolen article
were kept securely or if its value was less than a quarter of a
dinar in view of God’s saying: “ The thief, male and female,,
cut off their hand ” [Q. V, 42], for the term “ theft ” is binding
upon whomever steals, regardless of the value of the stolen
article or of its security. It would be possible to reject all the
traditions of the Apostle by saying: “ He did not say this [or
that]/’ if they were found to be not in accordance with divine
legislation Thus it would be permissible to reject the sunna
on one of two grounds: either if it were in conformity with
the general principles of the Book, but its wording were
different in certain respects from the wording [of the Book],

128

ISLAMIC JUR ISP RUD ENC E

or if its wording were phrased at greater length than that in
the divine communication, although they might be different
in some respects. The Book of God and the sunna of His
Apostle, however, provide [ample] evidence in contradiction
of this opinion and in support of the one I have stated earlier.
The Book of God [contains] perspicuous declarations by $nj
virtue of which blindness 8 will be healed. In it also will be
found evidence concerning the position of the Apostle in rela­
tion to the Book of God and His religion, [the Apostle’s] sub­
mission to God, and his clarification [of God’s word] on behalf
of Him.

The Abrogating and the Abrogated, of Which The
Book [of God] Indicates Some and the Sunna Others
110.
Shaft! said: I have heard some scholars who related
that God had imposed a certain duty for prayer before He
laid down that for the five prayers. For He said:
O thou enwrapped in thy robes,
Stay up the night, except a little,
Half of it, or a little less
Or a little more,
And chant the Qur'an distinctly [Q. LXXIII, 1-4].

God abrogated this [duty] by another, which may be found
in the same chapter [of the Book], and it reads as follows:
Thy Lord knows that thou remainest up nearly two-thirds of the
night, or half of it, or a third of it, and a party of those with
thee likewise, and God determines the night and the day. He
knoweth that ye will never count it up, so He has turned towards
you with mercy. So recite what may be convenient [for you] of
* I. e., ignorance.

the Qur*3n; He knoweth that some of you will be sick and others
journeying about in the land, seeking the bounty of God, and
others fighting in the cause of God. So recite what is convenient
of it, and observe the Prayer, and pay the alms [Q. LXXIII, 20].

For after God laid down His order “ Stay up the night . . .
half of it . . . or a little more,” He added: “ Nearly twothirds of the night, or half of it, or a third of it, and a party
of those with thee,” He [merely] shortened it and said: “ He,
knows that some of you will be sick . . . so recite what isconvenient of it. . .
111. Shaft*! said: So it is evident from the Book of God that:
**Thou remainest up nearly two-thirds of the night, etc. . .
has been abrogated by: “ So recite what is convenient of it.”
God's saying: “ So recite what is convenient of it ” may mean:
First, it is a confirmed duty which superseded another.
Second, it is an abrogated duty superseded by another, just
as it itself had superseded a previous one in accordance with
God’s saying:

$214

And as for the night, keep vigil a part of it, as a work of supere­
rogation for thee; it may be that thy Lord will raise thee up to
a laudable position [Q. XVII, 81].

For His saying*. " And as for the night, keep vigil a part of it,
as a work of supererogation for thee ” may mean that “ to
keep vigil “ is a duty in addition to that “ to recite what is
convenient of it.”
112. [Shaft*!] said: [In such a case] it is obligatory to seek
the evidence of the sunna for [determining] which of the two
meanings [is valid]. The sunna of the Apostle of God, how­
ever, has indicated that no duty other than that of the five
prayers is obligatory. We therefore hold that only the [duty
of] five [prayers] is obligatory and that any earlier prayers have
been abrogated by that sunna in accordance with God’s saying:
“. . , keep vigil a part of it, as a work of supererogation for
thee,” and that this has abrogated the one [stipulated in] the
" rising up at night, half of it, or a third of it or recite what
is convenient of the Book. . .
This does not mean at all

8115

130

ISLAMIC JURISP RUD ENC E

that we recommend abandoning the recital of what *is con­
venient of the Book in the periormance of prayer, for the more
the recital is prolonged the more we like it. [For] Malik
[b. Anas] told us from his uncle Abu Suhayl b. Malik from
his father who heard Talha b. ‘Ubayd-Allah say:
A tribesman from Najd, excited and crying, whose voice was
hardly intelligible until he came near [the Prophet’s company],
was really inquiring about Islam. ' Islam [imposes the obligation
of] five prayers [every] day and night,’ the Prophet said. *Am I
under any other [obligation]?’ he asked. ‘ No, not unless you
volunteer,’ replied [the Prophet] and he mentioned the fasting
during the month of Ramadan. ' Am I under any other [obliga­
tion]? ’ asked the tribesman. *No, not unless you volunteer,’
replied the Prophet. The tribesman departed, while murmuring:
4 By God I shall neither add to nor drop any of these [obliga­
tions].’ So the Apostle said: 4If [this man] will fulfil his promise,
he will be successful [as a Muslim in his life].’ 10

This [tradition] has also been related by *Ubada b. al-$amit
from the Prophet as follows:
Five prayers have been made obligatory on mankind by God.
He who fulfils them without neglecting or treating lightly any
one of them, has a covenant with God that He will let him enter
into Paradise.11

The Duty of Prayer [the Performance of Which]
the Book of God and the Sunna Indicate to
Whom it Might Not Apply Owing to [<z Valid]
Excuse, and Against Him Whose Prayer Is
Not Accredited Because of [Some Act
of] Disobedience
113 .

God, Blessed and Most High, said:

They will ask thee about m enstruation; say: It is harmful; so
withdraw from women in menstruation, and come not near them
until they are clean; but when they have purified themselves,
come to them as God has commanded you. Verily, God loves
those who turn continually in penitence, and loves those who
Keep themselves pure [Q. II, 222}.

Shah'! said: By means of ablution and washing away pollu­
tion, God imposed [the duty of] purity on him who prays, so
no prayer will be lawful save for him who is purified. When
God mentioned menstruation, He commanded withdrawal
from women until they are purified; when they are purified,
they become lawful [to men]. We conclude that purification
by water shall be performed after the end of menstruation,
and that purity cannot be attained by a menstruating woman
[merely] by the use of water, since water is always available
in towns. But God mentioned purification [by water] only
after [women] have become purified; which can be attained
only at the ending of menstruation, as stated in the Book of
God and the sunna of His Apostle.
Malik [b. Anas] told us from ‘Abd al-Rahman b. al-Qasim
from his father from ‘A’isha, who related that she was men*
struant during her visitation [of the Sacred Mosque] with the
Prophet. So [the Prophet] ordered her to perform the duty in
the same manner as a pilgrim “ but do not circumambulate
[the Ka'ba] until you are purified.” 12
11 Malik, Vol. I, pp. 410-11; Bukhari, Vol. I, pp. 393-94; Muslim, Vol.
XIII, pp. 141-44. Cf, Shaft'!, Kitdb aUUmm, Vol. I, p. 51.

S118

132

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

So we concluded that God meant that the performance of
the duty of prayer is obligatory on those who have achieved
purity by ablution and [complete] washing. Since menstruant
women18 cannot become purified by either [ablution or washing]—as menstruation is a natural occurrence beyond their free
will to constitute disobedience—they are excused from prayer
during menstruation and they need not make up for what
they neglected after the end of their menstruation.
114. Shaft*! said:14 By analogy with the menstruant women,
we hold that he who is [either] unconscious or insane, whose
mind has become sick by an order of God and not by his own
fault, is excused from [the duty of] prayer; for he cannot com­
prehend it as long as his state makes him incapable of
comprehension.
It is generally agreed among the scholars that the Prophet
did not order menstruant [women] to perform the [duty of]
prayer; but they are agreed that they should fast. We have
therefore made a distinction between the two duties on the
strength of the evidence I have just stated on the authority
of the scholars and their agreement [on this matter].
Fasting must be distinguished from prayer in the case of
the traveller, since he can postpone it until after the month
of Ramadan, but to neglect the travel-prayer is not permitted
for a single day. Fasting is obligatory but one month in
twelve, and is not obligatory in the other eleven months, but
no man who is capable of prayer is excused from it.
115. [Shafii said]: God said:
Draw n o t n ear to prayer w hen you are d ru n k en u n til you know
w hat you are saying, no r [when you are] polluted, unless you be
travelling o n the road, u n til you h iv e washed yourselves [Q. IV,
46].

Some scholars have said: This comm nication was revealed
before the one which prohibited the [drinking of] wine.18
*• Singular in the Arabic text.

sh £ f iT s R is a la

133

The Qur’an gives evidence (but God knows best) that the
duty of prayer should not be performed until the drunkard
can comprehend the things he recites, because the prohibition
of prayer [to the drunkard] is stated Erst and then the person
who is in a state of impurity (junub). So the scholars are
agreed that he who is in a state of impurity shall not pray at 8120
ail until he is purified.1*
Since the [performance of] prayer by the drunkard was pro­
hibited before [the drinking of] wine was prohibited, [the
performance of prayer by] the drunkard would be more appro­
priately prohibited after wine was prohibited, for [the drunk­
ard] would be doubly disobedient: First, because he prays in
a state [of drunkenness] which was prohibited, and secondly
because he drinks wine.17
Prayer [must be performed] byword and deed and by absten­
tion [from forbidden acts]. If .[he who prays] cannot compre­
hend the words, the deed, and the abstention, and cannot
perform the prayer as ordered, [the duty] is not fulfilled and
he must make up for it after he recovers.
He who is insane by God’s order and who is in a state
beyond the control of his free will must be distinguished from
him who is a drunkard, since «the latter has himself caused
the drunkenness and must make up for it, while he who is
insane did not inflict upon himself the disability which caused
him to be disobedient.
116.
[Shaft*!] said:18 God has commanded the Apostle to
turn in the direction of Jerusalem in prayer. Before this direc­
tion was abrogated it was not permitted to turn in any other
direction. But it was abrogated and [the Apostle] was ordered
to turn in the direction of the [Sacred] House: It became 8121
unlawful in accordance with a textual command to turn either
in the direction of Jerusalem or to any other direction than
that of the Sacred House.
“ Only by a major ablution (ghusl) can the state of impurity (junub)
be transformed into a state of purity. See ShJLfi*!, K itd b a U U m m , Vol. I,

117. [Shafi'i] said: Each [direction] was valid in its time:
The turning toward Jerusalem—when God ordered His Prophet
to turn to it—was obligatory; but after it was abrogated it
became obligatory to turn only toward the Sacred House, and
no other direction is permitted by law, except in the event of
fear [of danger] or in a supererogatory prayer in travel as indi­
cated in the Book and the sunna.
The same applies to whatever God has abrogated, for the
[word] abrogate means to repeal His command, [the obedience
to] which was right in its time, but its repeal rendered its $1$
abandonment right, [too]. He who was aware that [God’s] com­
mand was abrogated must obey the [new] command and aban­
don the abrogated one, but he who is not aware of it should
continue to obey the abrogated duty. For God said to His
Prophet:,
We may see thee turning thy face about toward the heaven. So
We shall put thee in possession of a qibla that will satisfy thee.
T urn thy face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque, and wherever
you may be, turn your faces in its direction [Q. II, 139].

118. Someone may ask: Where does the evidence lie [in
this communication] that [men] have been ordered-to change
[the direction] from‘one qibla to another.
119: [Shafii replied]: It is in God’s saying:
The fools among the people will say: 'W hat has turned them
from the qibla which they have been observing?’ Say: To God
belongs the East and the West; He guideth whom He willeth to
a straight path (Q. 11, 136].

Malik [b. Anas] told us from ‘Abd-Allah b. Dinar from 'AbdAllah b./Umar, who said:
When men were [performing] the dawn prayer in [the Mosque
of] Quba’,10 a •■messenger arrived and said: Quranic communica18 Quba’, situated on the outskirts of Madina, was the residence of the
tribe of the Band 'Amr b. 'Awf, among whom the Prophet passed a few
days after he migrated la Madina (1/622) before he moved into the town.
A mosque known by the name of this place was erected later where the
Prophet and his followers prayed. See Ibn Hisham, Vol. I, pp. 317, 333;

tion was revealed to the Prophet last night by virtue of which
he was ordered to turn toward the qibla (the direction of the
Ka'ba]. So while they were [praying] in the direction of al-Sha’m,
they [immediately] turned their faces toward the Ka'ba.2*

Malik [b. Anas] told us from Yaljya b. Sa‘ld from Sa'ld b.
al-Musayyib, who said: [After he migrated to Madina], the
prophet prayed for sixteen months in the direction of Jeru­ 6124

[Shaft*!] said: The evidence of the Book concerning
prayer in a state of fear may be found in God's saying:
If you fear [danger], pray either on foot or mounted [Q. II, 240].

So it is not permissible in accordance with the text [of the
Book] to pray when mounted unless one is in fear [of danger];
but [in such a case] God did not mention the qibla.
Concerning prayer in [a state of] fear, [’Abd-Allah] Ibn
‘Umar related from the Prophet a tradition in which he said:
In the event there is a serious fear [of danger] you may pray on
foot or mounted, regardless of the direction of the qibla.22

The Apostle prayed supererogatory prayers while riding his
camel, facing the direction in which she was travelling. This

ShawkSnl, Nayl al-Awtar (Cairo, 1952), Vol. IX, p. 172. T he change of
the Qibla from Jerusalem to Makka, as the traditions indicate, was the
result of the Prophet's quarrel with Jews. At first, it seems, he prayed
toward Jerusalem because of the veneration in which he saw it was held
by the Jews. It was also his desire to convert the Jews or reach an agree­
ment with them. Failing to achieve either conversion or a lasting alliance,
he decided to break with -them. T he change of the qibla, the first mani­
festation of this decision, meant that Muhammad wanted to substitute
Makka for Jerusalem as the center of his world. For the events leading
up to the change of the qibla, see Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, eds. Eugen Mittwoch
and Edward Sachau (Leiden, 1905-40), Vol. I, pp. 241-44; Tabari, Ta'rikh,

[tradition] was transmitted by Jabir b. ‘Abd-AUah, Anas b.
Malik and others.23 [The Prophet, however], never performed
the required prayer while travelling except on the ground and
in the direction of the qibla.
Ibn Abi Fudayk told us from Ibn Abi Dhi’b from ‘Uthman
b. ’Abd-AHah b. Suraqa from Jabir b. ‘Abd-Allah, who said:
During the campaign of the Banu Anmar24 the Prophet, mounted
on his camel, prayed in the direction of the east.26

121. Shafi'I said: 29 God said:
O thou prophet, stir up the believers to fight: If there be twenty
of you who endure, they will overcome two hundred, and if there
be a hundred of you, they will overcome a thousand of those who
have disbelieved, because they, are a people who do not under­
stand [Q. VIII, 66].

He [God] then declared in His Book that He relieved them
of the obligation calling for one believer to fight ten [unbe­
lievers] and confirmed the one which imposed the obligation
that one believer should fight two unbelievers in accordance
with His saying:
Now God has made it lighter for you and knows that there is
weakness in you. So if there be a hundred of you who endure,
they will overcome two hundred, and if there be a thousand of
you, they will overcome two thousand, by the permission of God.
God is with those who endure [Q. VIII, 67].

Sufyan [b. ’Uyayna) told us from ’Amr b. Dinar from Ibn
‘Abbas, who said:

‘♦This was an abortive campaign (A. H. 4/A. C. 626), for when the
news reached the Prophet that the Ranu Anmar b. Baghtd and the Band
Sa’d b. T ha’laba b. Dhubyan b. Baghid were preparing for war in Najd,
an expedition, headed by the Prophet, proceeded to the cast but found
that the enemy had already left. It was during this campaign that the
Prophet prayed, mounted on his camel, in the direction of the east. For

When the divine communication: 'I f there be twenty of you who
endure, they will overcome two hundred ’ was revealed, it became
obligatory upon the twenty [believers] never to retreat [in battle]
before two hundred [unbelievers]; and when God revealed: *Now
God has made it lighter for you and knows that there is weak­
ness in you—If there were twenty of you, etc.'—it became obliga­
tory on a hundred [believers] never to retreat before two hun­
dred [unbelievers].2*

[Shafi’i] said: This is in conformity with the opinion of
Ibn ‘Abbas. But God made this so clear in [His] communica­
tions that it needs no explanation.28
122. [Shafi’i said]: God said:
Those of your women who commit indecency—seek four witnesses
against them, and if they testify, confine them to their houses
until death takes them or God appoints for them a way out.
And when two of you commit [indecency] punish them both; but
if they repent and reform, then desist from them. Verily God
always has been relenting, compassionate [Q. IV, 19-20].
God, however, abrogated [the penalty of] confinement and
the inflicting of harm [by another communication], in which
He said:
The fornicatress and the fornicator—scourge each of them with
a hundred stripes [Q. XXIV, 2],
Thus the sunna specified that the scourging of a hundred
stripes should be [inflicted] on the unmarried fornicators.
*Abd al-Wahhab [b. *Abd al-Majld al-Thaqafi] told us from
Yunus b. ‘Ubayd from al-flasan from *Ubada b. al-$amit that
the Apostle said:
Take it from me [repeated twice], God has derided on a way [for
their punishment]: For [the fornication of] the unmarried couple
[the penalty] shall be scourging with a hundred stripes and
banishment for a year; lor [the adultery of] the married couple,

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

We are told by the trusted authority w from Yunus b. *Ubayd
from al-Hasan from Hitman al-Raqashl from 'Ubida b. al-$amit
from the Prophet a similar [tradition].
123.
[Shaft*!] said: The sunna of the Apostle specified that
the penalty of scourging with a hundred stripes for [fomica*
tion on the part of the] free unmarried couple was confirmed,
but that it was abrogated concerning the married; and that
the penalty of stoning for [adultery on the part of the] free
married couple was confirmed.81 For when the Apostle's
ruling: [" Take it from me, etc.”] was laid down, it abrogated
the [penalty of] banishment and scourging for the adulterers.
Since the Prophet ordered the stoning of Ma'iz [b. Malik
al-Aslami] rather than scourging him, and he ordered Unays
[b. al-Dahhak al-Aslamf] to inquire from the wife of Aslaml
and to stone her if she confessed adultery—this [precedent]
indicated that the scourging of the free married adulterers
was abrogated and that [the penalty of] stoning was confirmed,
since this was a later decision [which superseded an earlier
one].**
But the Book of God and the sunna of the Prophet indi­
cate that slave-adulterers are excluded from this [punishment].
Concerning slave-women, God, Blessed and Most High, said:
Bul& gh aUMar&m, p. 153; Shift*!, K it& b aU U m m , Vol. VI, p. 119, and
Vol. VII, p. 252 (m argin).
90 It is held, on the authority of al-Rabl’ al-Muradl, that Shift*! applied
the tenn “ trusted authority " to Yahya b. Hassan (see Bayhaqi. M anaqib,
folio 278);-but it is obvious that in this instance the trusted authority
must be someone else, since Yunus was bom in 144/761 after Hassin had
died in 139/756.
“ There is in the BOliq edition part of a tradition cited by Shaft! in
the following paragraph which adds nothing but verbal changes. This
addition, as Shikir has pointed out, is spurious. See abRis& la, Shakir’s

citation of the name of the wife of “ Aslaml ” is perhaps an error, as
other hadith digests do not cite the name of the woman. Traditions
indicate that M i !2 confessed in the presence of the Prophet four times
to his having intercourse with the. woman and the Prophet ordered him
to be stoned to death. See Abu Dawud. Vol.'IV, pp. 145-51; and Shawkanl,

If, then, having been taken u n d er ihsan,83 they com mit an inde­
cency, they shall be subject to half the punishm ent to which those
u n d er ihsan are subject [Q. IV, 30].

It is evident that half [the punishment] cannot be executed
except in scourging—which it is possible to divide—while
stoning, which leads to death, cannot be halved, for he [who
is subject] to stoning might die either by the first stone cast
on him or by a thousand or more. So it is impossible [to
d e te rm in e ] what half [of the punishment] is. The [limit of
such] penalties is specified by the destruction of life, and the
destruction of life is dependent on the number of strokes and
the size of the stones. Obviously no half of such a limit can
be determined.34
124. Shafi'I said:85 The Apostle of God said:
If It is proved that the slave-women of any one of you has com­
mitted adultery, she should be scourged.88
But [The Prophet] did not say that she should be stoned.
Nor did the Muslims differ on [the dictum that] slaves who
commit adultery are not subject to stoning. •
The taking of a slave-woman under ih§an is performed by
accepting Islam. We hold this [opinion] on the strength of
the evidence of the sunna and the agreement of the majority
of the scholars.
Since the Apostle decreed: “ If the slave-woman of any one
of you, etc." without stipulating: "W hether she was taken
under ib$an or not,” we concluded that God’s saying con­
cerning slave-women [which runs as follows]: “ If then, having
been taken under ih§an, they commit an indecency, they shall
be subject to half the punishment to which those under ilj$an
are subject,” [Q. IV, 30], must mean: If they [the slave-women]
have become Muslims, not that if they were taken as wives

were freed although the intercourse was not performed [in
marriage] ,ST
125. Someone may ask: Does it not appear that you give
ih$an a variety of meanings?
126. ;[Shafi*i] replied: Yes, for the aggregate meaning of
ih$£n is that there should be a bar against forbidden acts.
Islam may be one of them ;88 freedom [from slavery] is another;
the taking [of the woman] as a wife and the performance of
intercourse [through marriage] are still others; and finally
detainment in the house. [As a rule] anything that may pre­
vent [indecency] constitutes ih$an. For God said:
W e taught him the m aking o f garm ents for you to p ro tect you
from each o ther's violence [Q. X X I, 80].

And He said:
T hey will n o t fight against you all together, except in fortified
towns [Q. L IX , 14].

[The term fortified] means protected [tpwns].
127. [Shafi‘fJ said: The first and the last part [of the com­
munication] indicate that the meaning of ifisan—which is
stated in general [terms] in [this] place, not in others—is Islam,
not intercourse or freedom or confinement or chastity. These
are the various [possible] meanings of ifi$an.

Th6 Abrogating and Abrogated [Communications]
\yh\ch Are Indicated by the Sunna
and Consensus
128. [Shaft*! said]: God, Blessed and Most High, said:
Prescribed for you, when death draw s nigh to one o f you, an d he
leaves behind some property, is the m aking of a testament in
favor of his parents and relatives who are repu tab le—an obliga*
tion on the G od-fearing [Q. II, 176].

And He said:
A nd those of you who die, leaving wives, le t them m ake testa­
m ent for th e ir wives, provision for a year w ithout expulsion; b u t
if they go forth, there is no fault in you w hat they may do w ith
themselves honorably. G od is All-mighty; All-wise [Q. II, 2413-

Thus God provided [legislation] for the inheritance of
parents as well as for near relatives whether together with
them or as successors, and for the inheritance of the husband
from his wife and the wife from her Husband.
The two [foregoing] communications may be interpreted
either to confirm bequests for the parents and the near rela­
tives, bequest for the wife, and inheritance together with be­
quests, so that inheritance and bequests are lawful; or that
[the legislation concerning] inheritance abrogates [that con­
cerning] bequests.8?
Since both interpretations are possible, as we pointed out,
it is obligatory upon the learned to find an evidence in the
Book of God [as to which of the two is valid]; if nothing is
found in the text of the Book of God they should try the
sunna of the Apostle. If such an evidence is found, it should
be accepted from the Apostle, as [if] accepted from God by
virtue of God’s command to obey His [Apostle].
We have found that those learned in legal interpretation
and the authorities in the campaigns [of the Prophet]—whether

from [the tribe of] Quraysh or other [tribes]—are agreed that
in the year of the capture [of Makka (8/630)] the Prophet
said:
No bequest to a successor [is valid], nor shall a believer be slain
for [the blood of] an unbeliever.40

This tradition has been transmitted from those who have
heard it from the authorities on the [Prophet's] campaigns.
So this is a transmission by the public from the public and
is therefore of greater authority than the transmission of one
[individual] from another. Further, we have found that the
scholars are agreed [on the acceptance of this tradition].
129.
[Shaft*!] said: Some of the Syrian [transmitters] have
related [this] tradition [with an isnad or authorities] which
those who are learned in traditions do not confirm, because
some of the transmitters are unknown,41 So we have related
this tradition [directly] from the Prophet as an interrupted
[tradition].48
We have accepted this tradition, as I pointed out, on the
authority of those learned in the [Prophet’s] campaigns and
the agreement of the public, just as we have already related
it on the authority of all those who are learned in the cam­
paigns and the agreement of the public. [For] Sufyan [b.
'Uyayna] told us from Sulayman al-Ahwal from Mujahid that
the Apostle said: “ No bequest to a successor [is valid].” 43
si#
We have concluded that the Prophet’s ruling: “ No bequest
for a successor [is valid],” as I have stated, [means] that [the
legislation on] inheritance has abrogated that on bequests for
the parents and the wife, on the strength of the information
related by those learned in matters concerning the [Prophet’s]

related by Syrian authorities with the names of the transmitters,

^jupaigtis, interrupted traditions from the Prophet, and the
agreement of the public.
A great number of the public also have held that the [legis­
lation concerning] bequests for relatives was abrogated and is
no longer obligatory; for whenever they are entitled to inherit, S 141-142
*they are so by virtue of the [law of] inheritance; but when
they are not entitled to inherit, it is not obligatory that they
should inherit by a bequest.
Tawus [b; Kaysan] and a few other [authorities], however,
held that the [legislation concerning] bequests for parents has
been abrogated, though it was confirmed for relatives not
entitled to inherit. So it is not permissible for him who
' bequeaths to do so [to persons] other than relatives.
•' Since it is possible to maintain with Tawus that [the legis­
lation] affecting relatives is [still] valid—in as much as the
tradition transmitted by the authorities on [the Prophet’s]
campaigns merely states that the Prophet said: “ No bequest
for a'successor [is valid],” it is deemed' obligatory upon scholars
to se£k •an evidence either in support or against Tawus's
opinion.
We have found that the Apostle made a decision [con­
cerning] six slaves owned by a man who possessed no other
property .and who had set them free at the time of his death.
The Prophet divided them into three groups, freeing two
[slaves] and leaving four in slavery. This [tradition] had been S 143
related' to us by ’Abd al-Wahhab [al-Thaqafi] from Ayyub
al-Sakhtiyanl from Abi Qilaba from Abi .al-Muhallab ■from
•Imran b. iju$ayn from the Prophet.44
130.
[Shafi‘1] said: Thus the indication of the sunna, as
•provided in the tradition of Tmran b. Husayn, is that the
Prophet’s decree to free [the slaves] at the time of death con­
stitutes a bequest. Since the person who freed the slaves was S 144
an Arab—and the Arabs own foreign [slaves] with whom they
had no blood relationship—the Prophet allowed a bequest to
them to be valid. This [precedent] indicates that if a bequest

in favor of persons other than relatives were void, it would
be void concerning the freed slaves [too], as they were not
-blood relatives of [the man] who set them free.
It also indicates that the bequest of the deceased cannot
exceed one third of his estate; that what exceeds one third is
illegal; that bequests in favor of freeing slaves [already] earning
money for their freedom (istis'a*)45 are void; and that [the
choosing of two freed slaves out of six] by dividing them [into
three groups] is confirmed [on the basis of] the casting of lots.4*
Bequests to parents are no longer valid, since their [right
to] inheritance as successors is confirmed. A bequest made by
a deceased [person] to anyone—if he is not a successor1-is valid.
It is commendable—in my opinion—if [the deceased] leaves a
bequest to his relatives.
131.
Shafi’I said: 47 There are in the Qur’an other [exam­
ples] concerning abrogating and abrogated [legislation], which
may be found in their [proper] places, in the Kitab Ahkam
al-Qur’ah.46 I have discussed only some of the general prin­
ciples on the strength of which the meaning of other examples
may be sought. I am satisfied that these examples suffice for
others hitherto not dealt with. May I ask God [for His] pro­
tection [from error] and for success [in following the right].
I have dealt with the duties imposed by God, the general and
48 This term is applied to the slave who is partially freed provided he
pays out of his labor the price of the remaining portion in slavery.
48 On the strength of a tradition related by 'Imran b. Husayn the
Hanaff school permitted istis’a’, on the ground that the freeing of one
third of the six slaves means that one third of each one of them can be
freed and the remaining two thirds might be freed by istis'a*. Thus the
Hanafi school does not permit dividing the slaves into three categories
or the casting of lots in determining such division. The Sh&fi'I school,
however, rejects this interpretation and holds that the meaning of the
tradition is d ear,-that the Prophet permitted the freedom of only two
slaves out of six (constituting one third of the bequest) , and that his
division of the six into three groups meant that he permitted such a
division and, finally, that his choice constitutes the casting of lots. For
this reason istis'a’ is rejected, and the division into categories and the
casting of lots were accepted.

know that to obey his orders means to obey God, and that
his sunna is in conformity with what God revealed in His

comprehends this book knows that [God's] declaration is of
various forms—not just one—, the common feature of which
is that to the learned it is either clear or vague; but to those
lacking in [legal] knowledge, the declaration varies in vague­

Chapter V I I

[ON DUTIES]
The Duties Laid Down in the Text [of the Qufdri]

T hose who accuse wom en u n d er ihsan [of unchastity] an d do not

they are the ungodly [Q. X X IV , 4].

B2j

Shafi't said: The women under ih$an in question are those
who are freewomen and have come of age. This indicates that
ih$an is a collective term covering a variety of meanings.1
[God] said:
T hose who accuse th eir wives and have no witnesses except them ­
selves—let one of them testify by G od four times, th a t h e is of
those who speak the tru th . A nd a fifth tim e, th a t the curse of

mature woman, in possession of her faculties and who has had sexual
intercourse in a legal marriage. See Ibn Qutayba, Kitdb Ta'wil MushkU

any one who may accuse other [than the husband]—punishing
one other than the husband, unless he produces four wit­
nesses in support of his accusation, and excluding the husband
from punishment by virtue of the li'an 2—this indicates that
those who accuse women under ih$an, who are subject to
scourging [as a punishment], are those who accuse free and
mature women, not wives.
This is [another] example of what I have already explained
that the Qur’an [was revealed] in Arabic and that some of its
communications are explicitly general, intended to have par­
ticular [meaning], not that one of the two communications
meant to abrogate the other but that each is valid in the
manner indicated by God. So a distinction should be made
between the two [communications] in the manner God made
the distinction and the two be joined together in the manner
He united them.
So, if li'an were invoked, the husband would not be
punished, just as a party [in a dispute] is acquitted by wit­
nesses; if he refuses to invoke the li'an, he shall be punished
if his wife is a free woman and mature of age.
133.
[Shafi‘1] said: The communication concerning li'an was
revealed in connection with [the case of ‘Uwaymir] al-'Ajlanl
and his wife and the Prophet executed the procedure of the
li'an between them. This [precedent of] li'an was related by
Sahl b. Sa'd al Sa'idi and Ibn 'Abbas; but neither Ibn ‘Umar, S 143
who witnessed its execution, nor the others related the [actual]
words pronounced by the Prophet on the li'an.
These [authorities] related [other] decisions taken by the
Apostle, not to be found in the Qur’an, such as the cancellation
[of the marriage contract] between the two parties in the li'an,
voiding [the blood relationship of] the child [to the accusing
father], and his pronouncement: " If [the mother] gives birth
to the child and it possesses [the physiognomy] indicated [by
* I.i’an is an oath by virtue of which a husband may accuse his wife—

the accusing father], it belongs to the accused person.’* So if
the child proves to possess after birth similar resemblances
[to the accused person], he [the Prophet] said: ” the child’s
status is clear [that it belongs to him who is, accused], for has
not God laid down the rule [in the Qur'an],” [that such a case
must be decided by Ii’an, i. e., the cancellation of the marriage
contract and the voiding of the blood-relationship of the
child].* Ib n ‘Abbas [also] related that the Prdphet, [on hearing
the oath of accusation repeated for the fifth time], said: ” Stop
him [the husband], for this means punishment [for the wife].” *
134. Shafi'i said:8 We conclude that [the authorities] do
not relate certain needed portions of the tradition and relate
others, for had they known the portion concerning how the
Prophet executed the li*an [between husband and wife] they
would have related it. They only knew that whoever was
versed in the Book of God knew that the Prophet executed
the li‘an in accordance with God’s communication. They [the
authorities] were merely satisfied with what God provided for
li‘an, such as the number of oaths and that both could bear
witness [as stated in Q. XXIV, 6-9] without citing the Apostle's
decision on how he executed the li'an [between husband and
wife].
135. Shafi‘1 said: There are in the Book of God fully ade­
quate [communications] concerning li‘an and the number of
oaths; but some [of the authorities] have related [tradition}]
from the Prophet concerning the cancellation [of the marriage
contract between the two parties in the li'an] as I have already
said. Such traditions from the Apostle, which are in agree­
ment with the Book of God, have already been discussed.*

Fasting is prescribed for you as it was for those before you; per­
haps you will show piety. A certain num ber of days [Q. II, 179180].

And He specified the month by saying:
T h e m o n th of R am adan, in w hich the Q u r'an was sent dow n as
guidance for the people an d as evidences of the guidance an d
F urqan; so whoever of you is present d u rin g the m onth let him
fast in it; b u t if anyone is sick o r o n a journey [let him fast] a
n um ber o f o th e r days. G od desires ease for you, and desires n ot
hardship for you; and [it is] in o rd er th a t you may com plete the
[full] n u m b er o f [days], an d th a t you may magnify G od for the
guidance H e h ath given you; perhaps you will be than k fu l [Q.
II, 181].

Shafi'i said: I have known of no authority who related a
tradition from the Prophet specifying that the month for
fasting was the month of Ramadan—which falls between
Sha'ban and Shawwal—owing to certainty as to the place of
Ramadan among the other months; for men have been satis­
fied that God imposed the duty.
They [men] have obligated themselves to observe, fasting
during travel, and when they may break it, and they knew
how to make up for this duty as well as others on which there
is no explicit text in the Book [of God]. Nor have I known
anyone besides the scholars who needed [to know] 'which
month was Ramadan or whether [fasting in this month] was
obligatory. The same may be said about other prescribed
duties: T hat [men] must perform the prayer, [pay] the alms
and—for those who can manage it—perform the Pilgrimage;
that adultery, homicide, and similar acts are. forbidden.
137. [Shaft'!] said: Certain traditions have come from the
Apostle on these matters for which there are no specific texts
in the Qur’an, but the Apostle has specified on God’s behalf
the meaning intended by Him, while the Muslims provided
a number of derivative rules on which the Apostle laid down
no specific sunna.

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

For instance, concerning the man who divorces his wife by
pronouncing the third declaration [of divorce],7 God said:
If he divorces her, she shall not be lawful to him after th at, until
she marries ano th er husband. If he divorces her, th en it is no
fault for them to re tu rn to each other [Q. II, 230],

God’s saying: “ Until she marries another husband ” may
mean either until she [formally] marries another husband—
this was the meaning accepted by those to whom the communi­
cation was addressed and she was regarded as married once
the marriage contract was concluded—or until she [actually]
had intercourse with another husband, for the term nikah
may include both intercourse and the marriage contract.8 So
when the Apostle once said to a divorced woman, whose
divorce was pronounced three times by her husband and who
was then married to another man: “ You will not be lawful
[to your first husband] until you have tasted the sweetness
[of the second husband] and he has tasted yours,” 9 he meant
that she must have intercourse with another husband, and
that nikah [includes] intercourse.
138. Someone may ask: Will you cite a tradition from the
Apostle in support of your statement?
139. [Shafi'I] replied: Sufyan [b. 'Uyayna] told us from Ibn Ba
Shihab [al-Zuhrl] from ‘Urwa [b. abZubayr] from 'A’isha, who
said:
T h e wife of R ifa'a [al-Qurazi] once came to the P ro p h et and
said: ‘ Rifa'a has divorced me [complete divorce] an d *Abd alR ahm an b. al-Zabir m arried me, b u t [the latter's organ] is as
lim p as cloth’s nap.' 'D o you w ant to go back to R ifa 'a ? ' asked
the Apostle, [and he stipulated]; ' No, n o t u n til you taste his
sweetness and he tastes yours.’ 10
7 Bulaq ed., p. 23.
8 Literally nikah means intercourse, but the legal meaning is marriage
contract, which may or may not include intercourse. See JurjanI, p. 167;
and al-Mutarrazi, Vol. II, p.229. For the meaning of nikah in the Quranic
communication, see Tabari, Tafsir, Vol. IV, pp. 385-590; Bukhari, Vol.
Ill, p. 463.
8 The figurative meaning of the word 'usayla is used in the Arabic
text. See Lane, Lexicon, p. 2046.

made her lawful to the husband who pronounced her divorced
thrice [only] after another marriage [was consummated] with
jiikah* that
t*ie hikah was followed by intercourse with
the other husband.

[Quranic] Duties for Which the Apostle
provided Sunna
141. God, Blessed and Most High, said:
When you stand up -to pray, wash your faces, and your h an d s up
to the elbows, an d wipe your heads, a n d your feet u p to th e
ankles. If you are polluted, purify yourselves [Q. V, 8-9].

And He said:
Do n o t perform the prayer . . . w hen you are pollu ted —unless
you are travellers on the road—until you wash yourselves [Q. IV,
46].

So [God] made it clear that cleanliness from junub (pollu­
tion) must be performed by complete washing (ghusl), not
by ablution.11
142. Shafi‘1 said:12 The Apostle laid down sunna for ablu­
tion in conformity with God’s communication: So he [the
Prophet] washed his face, and his hands to the elbows; wiped
his head; and washed his feet up to the ankles. [For] *Abd
al-'AzIz b. Muhammad [al-Darawardi] told us from Zayd b.
Aslam from *Ata* b. Yasar from Ibn ‘Abbas from the Prophet
that the latter performed the ablution [by washing] each limb
once.18

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

Malik [b. Anas] told us from ‘Amr b. Yahya [al-Mazinl] from
his father who asked ‘Abd-AIlah b. Zayd, the grandfather of
‘Amr b. Yahya, "A re you able to show me how the Apostle
performed ablution?" " Yes,” replied 'Abd-Allah b. Zayd,
and he asked for water. He poured it over his hands and
washed twice; he rinsed [his mouth] and sniffed [water into his
nose] thrice; he washed his face thrice, and washed his hands
up to the elbows twice [each time], and wiped his head with
his hands moving them from the front and brought them
back—he began with his forehead until he carried them to
his neck, then he brought them back to the place from which
he had started—and [finally] he washed his feet.14
The literal [meaning] of God’s saying: “ Wash your faces ”
is that the minimum requirement for washing is once [each
time], but it may [also] mean more [than once]. So the Apos­
tle decreed that ablution must be performed by washing once
[each time], in conformity with the literal [meaning] of the
Qur'an. This~is the minimum requirement for washing,15
but it may mean more than once since [the Prophet] per­
formed it twice and three times.
Since [the Prophet] washed once [also], we have concluded
that if once does not fulfil [the duty], he would not have
performed it once before prayer. More than one ablution is si«
[therefore] optional—not obligatory—and that less than that,
[i*. e., once] does not fulfil [the duty].
This is in conformity with what I have already said con­
cerning other duties, namely that if the traditions were lacking,
the Book would be satisfactory without them; but if tradi­
tions were found about them, they indicate that they should
be in conformity with the Book of God.
143.
[Shafi'i said]: It may be that the authorities have
related traditions to indicate that although the Apostle ordi­
narily performed the ablution three times, they were intended

to be optional, not obligatory, so that the performance of less
than that number would not be regarded as failure to fulfil
the duty. However, since certain traditions specify that “ he
who performs the ablution thrice before prayer—and per­
forming a two-cycle prayer twice—without any distracting
thought [mixed with the prayer], his [sins] would be forgiven,"
[men] desired to increase the [number of] ablutions, but such
increase is supererogatory.
In the performance of ablution, the Apostle washed his
[hands] including the elbows, and [the feet] including the
ankles. The [Quranic] communication [concerning washing]
may either mean washing including [the elbows and ankles]
or washing without them. It was perhaps for clarifying the
meanings of this [communication] that the [two] traditions
were related. The one closest to the literal meaning of the
divine communication specifies that [the elbows and ankles]
should be [included] in the washing. For this [washing] is
made clear in the sunna as well as in the Qur’an. But though
this as well as the other [declarations] in the Qur’an are clear
enough to the scholars, to others the clarity in both is not the
same.
The Apostle laid down a sunna that washing to free one’s
self from pollution includes the washing of the genital organs,
the ablution—like the ablution before prayer—and the com­
plete washing (ghusl). We recommend that [his example] be
followed.
I know of no scholar from whom I have learned who has
disagreed that any washing should be satisfactory, provided
that it is complete, although men prefer otherwise [i, e., ablu­
tion and complete washing]. For [the Qur’an] prescribes
washing [only] without any specifications as in the* case of
ablution.
The Apostle laid down sunnas regulating [the circumstances
that call for] .ablution, and the [kinds of] pollution which
must be washed away, for such matters have not been dealt
with in the Book [of God].

[Quranic] Duties Which the Sunna
Specified are Intended To Be Particular
144. God, Blessed and Most High, said:
They will ask thee for a pronouncement. Say: God pronounces
to you concerning the indirect heirs. If a man perishes and has
no children, but he has a sister, she shall receive a half of what
he leaves and he is her heir if she has no children [Q. IV, 175].
And He said:
To the men belongs a share of what parents and near relatives
leave, and to the women belongs a share of what parents and g-,
near relatives leave, whether it be little or much, a share pre­
scribed [Q. IV, 8].
And He said:
And to his parents, to each one of the two belongs a sixth of
what he leaves, if he has children; but if he has no children and
his heirs are his parents, a third to his mother, or, if he has
brothers, to his mother a sixth, after any bequests he may
bequeath or any debts [have been paid]. As to your fathers or $«)
your sons you do not know which of them is the most advan­
tageous to you. So God apportions; verily, God is All-knowing,
All-wise.
A half of what your wives leave belongs to you, if they have
no children; but if they have children, a fourth of what they
• leave belongs to you after any bequests they may bequeath or
debts [have been paid] [Q. IV, 12-1S].
And He said:
To them belongs a fourth of what you leave, if you have no
children; but if you have children, an eighth of what you have
belongs to them, after any bequest you may bequeath or debts
[have been paid] [Q. IV, 14].
The sunna [merely] specified what God has provided for
those who are eligible to inherit: Brothers, sisters, children,
and the near relatives, parents, spouses, and all those who are

sh a fiT s R is a la

155

eligible to inherit in accordance with [the text of] the Book,
provided that the legator and the legatee [either] profess the
same religion [i. e., Islam] and belong to the people of the
lands of Muslims18 or are [non-Muslims] in treaty relations
with Muslims [by virtue of which] their lives and property
are secured.11 If they are polytheists, they are eligible to in­
herit in accordance with their [own law of]/poly theism. For S 168
Sufyan [b. 'Uyayna] told us from al-Zuhri from 'All b. IJusayn
from 'Amr b. 'Uthman from Usama b. Zayd who related that
the Apostle said: “ The Muslim cannot inherit from a non8169
Muslim, nor the non-Muslim from the Muslim.” 18
Furthermore, the legator and the legatee must be freemen
and Muslims. [For] Ibn 'Uyayna told us from Ibn Shihab [alZuhri] from Salim [b. ‘Abd-AIiah] from his father that the
Apostle said: “ He who sells a slave possessing property, the
property belongs to the seller unless the buyer stipulated
otherwise.” 19
145.
[Shafi'I] said: It is evident in the sunna of the Apostle
that the slave cannot own property, that what he owns belongs
to his master, and that ascribing to him title to property—
which may be [found] in his hands—merely means that it is
added to him [as an additional property], and not that he
possesses it, for [the slave] cannot be an owner [so long as]
he is incapable of possession, rather he himself is possessed;
he may be sold, given in gift, or bequeathed [as a chattel]. For
God [made lawful] the transfer of the property of the dead
to the living who can own what the dead had owned. So if S 170
the slave were to inherit property whether as a father or in
Dar al-Muslimln or Dar al-Isl&m is the territory of Islam. It may be
defined, broadly speaking, as the territory whose inhabitants observe
Islamic law, or, strictly speaking, the territory under Islamic rule. See
M. Khadduri, W a r a n d P eace in th e L a w o f Is la m , pp. 155-57.

any other capacity his share of the inheritance would be owned
by his master on his behalf, [even though] the master is neither
the father of the deceased nor an heir entitled to a share in
the inheritance. So if the slave were given the right of inheri*
tance as a father, it means the master will have the right of
inheritance and we would have given such a right [to a person]
to i whom God has not given it. For that reason, as I have
pointed out, we do not favor giving [the right of] inheritance
to, the slave, nor to any one who is not in possession of free*
dom and [the faith of] Islam and who is not devoid of homi­
cidal intent so that he is not regarded as a criminal. For
Malik [b. Anas] related from Yahya b. Sa*Id from *Amr b.
Shu'ayb that the Apostle said: “ He who kills [another] cannot
inherit [frpm him]/*20
146.
Shaft*! said: u So we hold that he who kills [another]
will not inherit from him. For the minimum [penalty] for a
killer with a criminal intent is to deprive him of [the right of]
inheritance, since he is disobedient to God and incurs His dis­
pleasure. There is no disagreement among the learned whom
I have known, whether in this country or in another, that the
Muslim cannot inherit from another unless he is a freeman
and clear of criminal intent. Their agreement—on w hat'I
have just stated—is a binding-evidence on-them "that they
should never disagree on any of the sunna of the Apostle. For
if the sunna on matters for-.which there -are textual communi­
cations has the same place as these communications; and is as
binding [on men] as the Qur'an, it indicates that for whatever
else the sunna provided—for which there are no divine com- sin
munications—it should be as binding [as the Qur'an]. The
scholars should be the last to have doubts as to its binding
force, and should know that God’s commands and those of
His Apostle are not contradictory, but follow the same pattern.
[For] God, Blessed and Most High, said:
Do not consume your property among you in vanity, although
there be trading by mutual consent on your part [Q. IV, 33].

147. [Shafii said]:22 And He said:
T hat is for their having said: Sale is just the same as usury,
though God hath permitted sale and forbidden usury [Q. II, 276].

Moreover, the Apostle prohibited certain [kinds of] sale,
mutually agreed upon among partners—which become un­
lawful-such as [the exchange of] gold for gold except in equal
quantities, and gold for silver, whether in cash or credit,28 or
whatever is implied in their meaning provided the exchange
involves [neither] risk nor the concealment of anything [con­
cerning the sale] from the buyer by the vendor.
So the sunna indicated that God made lawful sales [of every
kind] which are not.forbidden, except those which He has
forbidden through His Prophet's tongue.
Moreover, the Apostle provided sunna for other [kinds of]
sale, such as the following:
1. [If] a slave is sold with a defect concealed by the vendor
[in order] to deceive the purchaser, the latter has the right
to return [the sl*v£] and keep any profits [arising from the
slave's employment].24
2. If a person sells a slave who possesses poperty, the property
belongs to.the vendor unless stipulated otherwise [in the con­
tract of sale].25
^
5. If a person sells a pollinated palm tree, the fruits belong
to the vendor unless stipulated otherwise, [in the contract of
sale].28
These [traditions] are binding on men for God imposed the
obligation that they should obey [the Prophet’s] order.

General Duties:

Verily prayer has become for the believers q thing prescribed [to
take place at] stipulated times [Q. IV, 104]..'

And He said:

,

Observe the prayer and pay the zakat (legal alms) [Q. II, 40, 77,
104 etc.].

And He said to His Prophet:
Take of their wealth a sadaqa (free-will alms)2T to cleanse arid
purify them thereby and pray for them [Q. IX, 104].’.

And He said:
Pilgrimage to the House is a duty to God from the people, who­
ever is able to make his way there [Q. Ill, 91].

God has laid down in the Qur’an the duties of prayer, zakat
and pilgrimage and specified the modes [of their performances]
through His Prophet’s tongue.
So the Apostle specified that prayers .[each day] shall number
five; that the number of cycles28 in the noon, ‘a$r 29 and the
evening prayers shall1number four repeated twice in the towns;
and that cycles at the sunset prayer shall number three, and
at the dawn prayer two.
He decreed that in all [the prayers] there should be recitals
H Shaft*! seems to use zakat and sadaqa interchangeably, although the
two are not strictly speaking synonymous terras. $adaqa, a free-will alms,

military operations. See G.-H. Bousquet and J. Schacht, Selected Works

from [the Qur’an], audible in the sunset, evening, and dawn
prayers, and silent recitals in the noon and ‘a$r prayers.
He specified that at the beginning of every prayer there
shall be the takblr [declaration that God is great] and at the
ending the taslim [salutations on the Prophet and his housej
and that each [prayer] consists of the takbir, the recital, the
bowing, and two prostrations after each inclination, but beyond
these nothing is obligatory.
He decreed that prayer while one is on a journey can be
shorter—if the traveller so desires—in the three performances
that have four cycles, but he made no change in the sunset
and dawn prayers when the prayer is performed in town.
However, all prayers must be [performed] in the direction of
the qibla [facing Makka], whether one is in town or on a
journey, except in the case of prayer of fear.8®
He decreed that supererogatory [prayers] must be performed
in the same manner; They are unlawful without the puri­
fication or the recital or any other requirements for obligatory
[prayers] such as the bowings, prostrations and the qibla
whether performed in the towns or in the country or on the
ground during' travel. In a supererogatory prayer, however,
the rider may pray in any direction that his animal may be
moving. [For] Ibn Abi Fudayk told us from Ibn Abl Dhi’b
from 'Uthman b. ’Abd-AHah b. Suraqa from Jabir b. *AbdAllah that in the campaign against the Banu Anmar the
Apostle was [seen] praying while riding his camel toward the
east.81 A similar tradition was transmitted by Muslim [b.
Khalid al-Zanji] from Ibn Jurayj from Abu Zubayr from Jabir;
but I do not know whether the name of the Banu Anmar was
mentioned or whether the tradition [merely] stated that [the
Prophet] prayed during travel.82
The Apostle also decreed that in the feast- and rain-prayers
the number of bowings and prostrations must be the same;
*° Prayer of fear may be performed in case of a threat or an attack in
war. See Sh&fil, Kitab al-Umm, Vol. I, pp. 83-84.

but he added a cycle to the eclipse-prayer, raising the number
[oi bowings and prostrations] in each cycle to two. So we are
told by Malik [b. Anas] from Yahya b. Sa'Id from ‘Amara
[daughter of 'Abd al-Rahman] from 'A’isha from the Prophet.
The same [tradition] was related by Malik [b. Anas] from

from Malik b. Anas from Zayd b. Aslam from ‘Ata’ b. Yasar
from Jbn 'Abbas from the Prophet. The wording of the
Prophet’s prayer, related by 'A’isha and Ibn 'Abbas, may be
somewhat different, but all are agreed that [he performed] the
eclipse-prayer in two cycles, each one [repeated] twice.**
Concerning prayer, God said:
Verily the prayer has become for the believers a thing prescribed
for stated times [Q. IV, 104],

The Apostle specified on God’s behalf the time [of each
prayer]. He performed [each] prayer at its specified time,
except that when he was besieged in the battle of al-Ahzab 8*
he could not [perform each] prayer on time for that reason;
so he delayed [the prayers] until [he was able to perform] the
noon, the ‘asr, the sunset, and the evening prayers at the same
time.
Muhammad b. Isma'il b. Fudayk told us from Ibn Abi Dhi’b
from al-Maqburl from 'Abd al-Rahman b. Abi Sa'id from his
father who saidr

[Q. II, 240].88

[Shafi‘1] said: So Abu Sa'Id made it clear that [the
practice of deferred prayers] preceded the communication to
the Prophet concerning fear-prayer. The communication in
which the fear-prayer is stated runs as follows;
When thou art journeying in the land, there is no fault in you
if you shorten the prayer, if you fear the unbelievers may molest
you. Verily the unbelievers are for you a manifest enemy.
When thou art amongst them and hast set up the prayer for
them, let a party of them stand with thee, and let them take their
weapons, and when they prostrate themselves, let tliem be behind
you; and then let another party who have not prayed come and
pray with thee, taking their precautions and their weapons [Q»
IV, 102-103].

Malik [b. Anas] told us from Yazid b. Ruman, from $alih
b. Khawwat from those who prayed with the Apostle the fearprayer during the campaign of Dhat aI-Riqa‘ said;
A company [of believers] stood in rank [for prayer] with [the
Prophet] while another watched the enemy. He performed one
cycle with those who stood with him and remained standing
until the company completed [the prayer]. Having thus taken
the position of those facing the enemy, another company stood
[with the Prophet], who performed the other cycle and remained
sitting while the company completed their prayer until he
[uttered] the salutation with them .87

The same tradition has been related by 'Abd-Allah b. *Utnar
b. Ha£s from his brother ‘Ubayd-Allah b. 'Umar from al-Qasim
b. Muhammad from $alifi b. Khawwat from his father Khawwat b. Jubayr from the Prophet.8*
It is evident from these [traditions]—as I have already stated
in this book—that whenever the Apostle laid down a sunna ^
inspired by God in order to abandon or abrogate another, he
laid it down as an evidence given to men that they should
obey this sunna, not the earlier one.
So God abrogated [the communication concerning] the de­
ferment of prayer in the event of fear and [replaced it] by
another—as both God and His Prophet have laid it dow ndirecting that it should be [performed] at its [specified] time.
The Apostle abrogated his sunna concerning the deferment
of this prayer in accordance with Godrs command by another
sunna, and the Apostle [himself] performed this prayer at its
specified tinys, as I already have pointed out. [For] Malik sis*
[b. Anas] told us from Nafi' from Ibn 'Umar, who stated con­
cerning fear-prayer that the Prophet said:
Xf there is a serious fear [of danger],’ you may pray on foot or
mounted regardless of the direction of the qibla.30
A similar tradition was related by a certain man on the
authority of Ibn Abl Dhi'b, from al-Zuhrl from Salim from sias
his father from the Prophet.
150.
[Shafrfj said: So the sunna of the Apostle indicated,
as I have already said, that [facing] the qibla is at all times
obligatory except when it i« impossible to perforin the prayer
in the specified direction, such as at the time of sword-play,
flight [from battle], or equivalent situations in which it is
impossible to pray in the direction [of the qibla].
Thus the sunna was confirmed that the prayer must not be
deferred beyond its specified time, but that [it should be per­
formed] in whatever direction the person is able to do it.

The Zakdt (Legal Alms)

God said:

Observe the prayer and pay the zakat [Q. II, 40, 77, 104].

S 186

And He said:
A nd the observers of the prayer and the payers of the zakat [Q.
IV, 160].

And He said;
So woe to those who pray, who of th eir prayer are careless,ywho
make a show, b u t w ithhold charity [Q. C V II, 4-7].

Some of the scholars said: [These communications refer to]
the duty of zakat.
God said:
T ak e of their goods a freewill offering to cleanse and purify them
thereby, and pray for them ; thy prayers are com fort for them .
God is All-hearing, All-knowing [Q. IX , 104].

The reference of this communication is to goods in general,
but it may [also refer] to certain goods to the exclusion of
others. So the sunna specified that the zakat should be paid
on some goods, not on all.
Since goods are of various categories—such as the cattle—
the Apostle ordered the payment [of alms] on camels and
sheep, and indicated—as we are told—that it should be paid
on cows in particular from among the cattle, and a certain
percentage has been specified by God through His Prophet’s
tongue.40 Since men possessed cattle consisting of horses,
donkeys and mules and others which the Apostle exempted
from payment—for he laid down the sunna that horses were

the zakat should be paid on cows: a calf for every thirty cows and one
cow for every forty. See Shafi'l, Kitab al-Umm, Vol. II, pp. 7-8; ShawkanI,
Nayl al-Awtdr, Vol. IV, pp. 141-42; Abu Dawud, Vol. II, pp. 101-102;

exempt from alms—it is evident that alms must be paid only
on what [the Prophet] specified, not on all.
As to men who possess sown and planted products such as
palm-dates and grapes, the Apostle ordered.payment of alms
on both on [the basis of] a rough estimate [of the value of
each tree]. The rate of payment was one-tenth [of the total
value] if [the land] were watered by rain or from a spring and
half of the one-tenth if it were watered by wells.41
Some of the scholars held by analogy to palm-trees and
grapes that [aims] on olive trees [should be one-tenth as well].
Since men possess crops of varied produce other than palmdates, grapes and olives, such as walnuts, almonds, figs, and
others, which the Apostle has exempted'from payment, we
concluded that God imposed the payment of alms on some
crops, but not on all,
152.
Shaft*! said:44 Men have produced wheat, barley, millet
and similar products, on which, we are told, the Apostle
ordered the payment [of alms]. By analogy of wheat and
barley, alms have been paid on grain, suit [kind of barley],4*
’alas [kind of wheat],44 rice, and all other products which men
have produced and eaten, such as bread, *a?Ida, sawiq,.udm,45
chick-peas and qa{tan! [general term for lentils, etc,] which
may be made into flour or bread, etc), in the same way as the
Prophet ordered the payment of the alms on similar p ^ucts
which men produced for fpod.48
Men have produced other products on which neither the
/Apostle, nor those who succeeded him, ordered payment [of
alms], for they do not fall ik the category of products on which
[the Prophet] imposed alrps, such as thufa’, asbiyush, kusbara

from alms. This indicates that alms are [obligatory] on some
products, but not on all.
153. Shaft*! said:48 The Apostle ordered the payment of
alms on silver, and the Muslims followed his precedent on
gold, either [on the strength of] a narrative which was not
transmitted to us 49 or on [the strength of] analogy that gold
and silver are measures of price which men used to hoard or
pay in exchange for goods in various countries before the rise
of Islam and after it.
Men possess other [kinds of] metal such as brass, iron, and
lead on which neither the Apostle nor those who succeeded
him imposed alms. They are exempt on [the strength of]
precedent and they should not, by analogy with gold and
silver, be subject to alms, for gold and silver are used as
standards for prices in all countries, and all other metals may
be purchased by them on the basis of a specific weight at a
certain time.
Although ruby and chrysolite are more precious than gold
and silver, neither the Apostle nor those who succeeded him
have imposed alms on them as far as we know. Since they are
possessed by a special [class] and are not used as a medium of
exchange—because they are not measures of price—they are
exempt [from alms].80
154. Shaft*! said:61 According to what the public have re­
lated from the Apostle concerning the alms on the cattle and
measures of price [i. e., gold and silver], he ordered its pay­
ment once a year. For God said:
Give the due portion of it on the day of its harvesting [Q. VI,

cation, at the time of the harvest, not at other times. And
he specified that [the alms] on rikaz [natural and hidden
treasures] shall be one-fifth, to be paid on the day they are
produced, not at other times.8* For Sufyan [b, ‘Uyayna] told
us from al-Zuhri from [Said] b. al-Musayyib and Abu Salama
from Abu Hurayra that the Apostle said: " One-fifth [shall be
paid] on rikaz.” 88
If it were not for the evidence of the sunna, all goods would
have been treated on an equal footing on [the basis of] the
literal meaning of the Qur'an, and the alms would have been
imposed on all, not on some only,

[Pilgrimage]
155.
[Shafii said]: God imposed the duty of al-hajj (Pil­

from the Prophet that the means (al sabll) consists of the
necessary provisions and transport (i. e., donkey or camel) ,8S
And he [the Prophet] specified the time of Pilgrimage, how
to pronounce the formula of fulfilling [the duty],88 and what
is decreed [as recommended acts], and what should be avoided
in the wearing of garments and the use of perfumes as well
as other procedural matters [such as the halts] at the [sanc••ShSfi'I, K ita b a l- U m m , Vol, II, pp. 31-32.

and the throwing [of the stones at Mina], the shaving [of the
head], the circumambulation [of the Ka'ba] and other matters.67
If someone was unaware that there was a sunna for matters
on which there was a text in the Book of God except what I
have already stated concerning the sunna laid down by the
Apostle [specifying] the meaning implied in God’s general
communication, and that [the Prophet] merely explained God’s
prescribed acts, prohibited or permitted that I have men­
tioned, and all other matters connected with them, including
their time of fulfilment as well as other matters not dealt
with [in God’s communications], it became obligatory on men
that if the sunna of the Apostle confirms [and explains] God's
communication in one or more instances it shall do so always.
It is evident that the [Prophet’s] sunna never contradicts
the Book of God, and that his sunna—even in the absence of
legislation in the Book—is binding, as I have already stated
here and elsewhere, in accordance with God’s command! to
obey His Apostle. [For] it is obligatory on men to know that
God has not given any other [person] such power save His
Apostle, and that the word and deed of every person should
be in conformity with the Book of God and the sunna of His
Apostle. And the words and deeds of every one should con­
form to the Book /of God and the sunna of His Apostle, and
that should the opinion of a certain scholar be contradictory
to the sunna of the Apostle, one should abandon that opinion
when he becomes aware of the contradiction and should obey
the sunna of the Prophet; for if one does not do so he is
not excused. For what is more obligatory on men than that
they should obey the Prophet, an obligation indicating the
place in which [God] placed him in relation to His revelations,
His religion and the followers of His religion?

[The Tdda or Waiting Period]
156. God said:
Those o£ you who die, leaving wives, let them keep to themselves
for four months and ten days [Q. II, 254],

And He said:
Divorced women shall keep to themselves for three periods [Q.
II, 228],

And He said:
For those cf your women who have despaired of [further] men*
struation, if you are in doubt, their period of waiting shall be
three months, as it is for those who have not menstruated as yet.
For those who are pregnant, their term is when they are delivered
of what they bear [Q. LXV, 4).

Some of the scholars said: Since God has obligated the
woman whose husband dies to wait four months and ten
[days], and has specified the period of waiting for the preg­
nant [woman] to last until she has been delivered, [it follows
that] if the husband dies and the woman is pregnant she is
bound by the two periods concurrently just as she would be
bound to fulfil any other two duties combined together.68
157. [Shafii] said: But since the Apostle said to $ubay‘a,
daughter of al-IJarith, who gave birth to a child a few days
after her husband's death: “ You are lawful [for marriage] and
you may get married,” this indicates that the ‘idda—whether
in the case of death or divorce to be fulfilled by [the expiration
of] the required months—was intended to [bind] women who
are not pregnant; but if they are pregnant the ‘idda is
dropped.68

[forbidden Women ]
158.

God said:

Forbidden to you are your mothers and daughters, your sisters,
your aunts, paternal and maternal, your brother's daughters, your
sister's daughters, your mothers who have given suck to you, your
suckling sisters, your wives’ mothers, your stepdaughters who are
in your care being born of your wives you have been in to—but
if you have not yet been in to them, it is no fault in you—and
the spouses o£ your sons who are of your loins. And it is forbidden for you to take two sisters together, unless it be a thing
of the past; God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate; and wedded
women except what your right hand has possessed. So God pre­
scribes for you. And it is lawful for you to seek what is beyond
that by means of your wealth in wedlock and not in debauchery;
those of them whom you enjoy thereby pay their hire as stipu­
lated, and it is no fault in you in regard to anything you may
give them by mutual agreement beyond the stipulated amount.
Verily God is All-knowing, All-wise [Q. IV, 27-28].
This communication m ay. have two meanings: [it may
mean] that the women whom God has [specifically] forbidden
shall be [regarded as] forbidden, and that those whom He has
not specifically forbidden, shall be lawful on the ground that
He is [both] silent about them and by His saying: “ And [it is]
lawful for you to seek what is beyond that ” [Q. II, 28]. This
may be regarded as the literal meaning of the communication.*0
But it is evident in this communication that the prohibition
concerning the taking of [the two sisters] together as wives
must be distinguished from the prohibition of taking mothers
[as wives]. So what God specified as lawful shall be lawful;
what He specified as forbidden shall be forbidden; and what
He prohibited concerning the taking of the two sisters together
[as wives] shall be prohibited.
God’s prohibition of the taking, [of two sisters] as wives is
an evidence that He has [merely] forbidden taking them
together, but that taking each one separately is lawful in

principle while the taking of mothers, daughters, and paternal
and maternal aunts is unlawful in principle.
The meaning implied in the communication: ” And [it is]
lawful for you to seek what is beyond that ” is to specify those
women who are in principle forbidden as well as others of ^
equal status related by suckling—these can only be married
in accordance with [the prerequisites of] lawful marriage.
159. Some one may ask: What is the evidence for that?
160. The answer is: 91 Since [the maximum number of]
women who may lawfully be taken as wives is four, the taking
of a fifth [would be unlawful] and the marriage contract
would have to be dissolved. For no [woman] shall be lawful
unless taken in accordance with a valid marriage contract.
The taking of a fifth woman, like the taking of a single one,
is lawful in accordance with God's saying: **And [it is] lawful
for you what is beyond that,” provided she is taken in a lawful
manner and in circumstances making the marriage lawful and
not forbidden in principle.
But marriage between a man and a woman will not, under
any circumstances, forbid other marriages to her paternal or
maternal aunts—as God has forbidden his marriage to the
wives* mothers—so her paternal and maternal aunts may be
included in the category of who may lawfully be married, smx
Just as it is lawful for a man to marry another woman if one
o! his four wives is separated from him [by death or divorce],
so the maternal aunt becomes lawful, if the daughter of her
brother is separated [from her husband].

[Forbidden Food]
161. God said to His Prophet:
Say: I do not find, in what, is revealed to me, anything forbidden
to one who eats of it, unless it be a dead animal, or blood out« BQliq ed., p. 29.
** For further •discussion on forbidden women, see ShSfi*!, Kitab clVm m. VoL V, pp. 2-5.

poured, or the flesh of swine, for it is an abomination, or an
impious thing over which the name of a god other than God has
been invoked [Q. VI, 146].
This communication may have two meanings: First, that
nothing is forbidden at all except what God has [specifically]
excluded. This is the clearest and the broadest meaning and
any one presented with it will understand at once that nothing
is forbidden except what God has specifically forbidden. If it
means otherwise, the scholars are under obligation to accept
no other meaning save what the sunna of the Prophet specifies
and they should say: “ This is the meaning intended by God,
Blessed and Most High.”
Nothing in the Book of God nor in the sunna [of His
Prophet] is regarded as a particular [communication] unless
there is a specific [evidence] in either one or in both, and
nothing is regarded as particular unless the divine communi­
cation is intended to mean particular. So what is not intended
to be a [particular] communication, must never be so regarded.
So God's saying: " Say: I do not find, in what is revealed
to me, anything forbidden to one who eats of it . . .
may
mean that the Apostle was asked [to specify] a certain thing
to the exclusion of others. And it may [also] mean [nothing
forbidden] in what you were eating. This [may be] the appro­
priate meaning in accordance with the evidence of the sunna.
For Sufyan [b. ‘Uyayna] told us from Ibn Shihab from Abu
Idris al-Khawlanl from Abu T haiaba [al-Khushnf] that the
Prophet prohibited “ the eating of beasts having fangs.” M And
Malik [b. Anas] told us from Isma'il b. Abl Hakim from
*Abida b. Sufyan al-Ha<£ranri from Abu Hurayra from the
Prophet who said: “ The eating of any of the beasts which
have fangs is forbidden." e4

[ Women's Abstention during the 'Idda of Their
Husbands’ Death]
162. God said:
Those of you who die, leaving wives, let them keep to themselves
for four months and ten [days]; when they reach the end of their
term, then it is no fault in you what they may do with them­
selves honorably. God is aware of what you do [Q. 11, 234].
So God specified that [women] who [suffer] the death [of
their husbands] are under obligation of the ‘idda [four months
and ten days] and that upon the expiration of the term they
shall be free to do honorably with themselves whatever they
may wish, but He mentioned nothing else to be avoided during
the ‘idda.68
The literal meaning of the divine communication is that
[the widow] should abstain only from getting married during
the ‘idda and that she should stay in her house.
[The communication] may [also] mean that [the widow]
should [not only] abstain from marriage, but also from certain
other things which were not forbidden to her before the ‘idda,
such as [the use of] perfume and [the wearing of] ornaments.
Since the Prophet decreed that the widow must abstain
from the use of perfume and the like, she is under obligation
to do so [by virtue] of the duty imposed by the sunna, but her
abstention from marriage and her stay in the house of her
[deceased] husband are [imposed on her] by the Book and
the sunna.
The sunna’s role here as elsewhere is [merely] to specify on
God’s behalf what [the widow] should abstain from doing,
just as it specifies [the duties of] prayer, aims, and pilgrimage.
The sunna [also] provides [rules] laid down by the Apostle
[for matters] on which there is no divine communication.

First, the act prohibited must be in itself unlawful, never

if the Apostle prohibits a certain act it shall be regarded as
unlawful, and no particular act is permitted unless it falls

wa{P (intercourse with a slave-woman) by virtue of possession
These are the two ways made lawful by God [in His Book].
The Apostle laid down in the sunna the modes in which the
nikah makes previously forbidden women lawful, [such as] the
need for a guardian, [the testimony of] witnesses and the con­
sent of the thayyib woman.2 The Prophet’s stipulation con­
cerning the woman’s consent is an evidence that [prior] consent
of the [two] spouses is a prerequisite without distinction
between them. Thus if the marriage [contract] fulfils four
conditions—consent of the thayyib woman and the man,
[presence of the] guardian who arranges the marriage for the
woman, and the witnesses—it would be lawful, except in cer­
tain cases which I shall cite later. But if it lacks any one of
the four conditions, it becomes fasid (invalid), because it
would not be in accordance with the sunna laid down by the
Apostle for a valid marriage. If a sadaq (bride-price) were
added [as an additional condition] it would be commendable;
but the marriage [contract] would not be fasid without it, for
God’s stipulations concerning marriage do not include mahr
(dowry) .3 (This subject has been treated elsewhere) * These
conditions are as equally [applicable] to honorable as to dis­
honorable women, for each one is equal to the other in all
matters that are lawful and unlawful, obligatory or unobligatory, punishable or unpunishable.
167.
Shafi'I said; 6 The circumstances in which marriage is
permissible—in accordance with what I have described—are
those in which marriage is _iot prohibited, for if marriage is
made in accordance with the prohibited circumstances, it
would be regarded as void by the orders laid down by God
in His Book and by the Prophet’s tongue. For example:
[Marriage is void] if a man marries his wife’s sister, because
God prohibited the taking of two sisters as wives; or if a man

ta)ces a fifth woman as wife, because God permitted only four
[at a time] and the Prophet made it clear that God prohibited S 346
the taking of any additional one; or if one marries his wife’s
aunt, paternal or maternal, since this is prohibited by the
prophet; or if one marries a woman during her *idda. All
these marriages are not lawful, for they are all prohibited, and
B 48
no disagreement exists among scholars about them.
168.
Shafii said: In like manner the Prophet prohibited
[such marriages as] al-shighar,8 and mut'a.7 He [also] pro­
hibited the pilgrim, [whether man or woman] from marrying
or getting married [during the performance of Pilgrimage],
W e hold that all such marriage [contracts] in the circumstances
in which he [the Prophet] prohibited them, must be dissolved,
just as other marriages which we have already cited must be $347
dissolved. Some [scholars] may disagree with us on this matter,
but we have discussed this elsewhere.8 Similarly, the marriage
in which the woman is married without her prior consent
[must be dissolved]. She may give her consent later—which is
not permissible—but the contract was void at the time it was
concluded.
Similarly the Apostle prohibited the gharar sale,9 the sale
•Shighar is a mode of marriage which existed in Arabia before Islam
by virtue of which a person may marry the sister or daughter of another
person, and the latter reciprocating in like manner, so that neither one
will need to collect the mahr (dowry) from the other. For ShafiTs further
treatment of the subject, See Kitab al-Umm, Vol. V, pp. 68-69.
7 Mut*a is a form of temporary marriage; its period is fixed, and the
contract is dissolved automatically at the end of the period. This form
of marriage, practiced in Arabia before Islam as well as in the early
Islamic period (Q. IV, 24), was later declared' abolished. The contra­
dictory traditions reflect the controversy among early jurists as to its
validity until it was rejected by the Sunni schools. It is still valid in
Shn law. For ShafiTs further treatment of the subject, see Kitab alVmm, Vol. V, pp. 71 f,; and J. Schacht, Origins of Muhammadan Juris­
prudence, pp. 266-67.

•T h e gharar is a kind of sale in which uncertainty is involved, such
as the sale of fish or birds before they are actually caught or produced
by the vendor. See Shafii, Kitab al-Umm, Vol. HI, p. 75.

of dry dates for ripe dates except the sale of al-’araya,10 and
others. For in principle one’s own property is forbidden to
another save in a lawful manner and by [the kinds of lawful]
sale the Apostle did not prohibit, but no sale prohibited by
the Apostle which is unlawful in principle renders one’s
property lawful to another. Disobedience of a prohibition of
sale does not make lawful what was unlawful, for in principle
the unlawful will not become lawful except in acts which
constitute no disobedience. These [examples] fall in the cate­
gory of [legal] knowledge for the public.
169. Someone may ask: What is the kind of [orders of] per­
mission that is prohibited to men [only] in specific cases and
is different from the kind of [orders of] prohibition which you
have just stated?
170. [Shafi'i replied]: It is like the Apostle’s order of pro­
hibition against wearing a single robe by a person who folds
it on one side leaving uncovered a certain private area of his
body while a lad is eating before him. [The Prophet] pro­
hibited eating from the top of ,the dish; he is reported to have
prohibited—although this is not certain—eating two dates to­
gether, exposing the inside of the date [prior to eating], and
halting on the road for rest.11 Since the wearing of the robe,
the eating of food (as much as one desires), and [walking on]
the earth (which belongs to God, and all men are equally
entitled to use it) are all lawful acts, the Prophet's order of
prohibition refers to particular acts which are different from
those he permitted. For the [Prophet’s] order of prohibition
[is limited] only to the wearing of the robe if it were folded
in such a way that it leaves uncovered a certain part—the
*awra (private parts) —but if the *awra were covered by the
cloth, the prohibition against uncovering the *awra should
not include the wearing of the robe, since one can wear it
without uncovering the 'awra. [Similarly] the Prophet’s orders

Prophet, m ay,be said to tail in the same category as the muzabana sale.
See paragraphs 346-347, below.
11 See BukhSrl, Vo!. Ill, p. 507; Muslim, Vol. XIII, pp. 228-29; AbO
Dawud, Vol. Ill, p. 362; Vol. IV, p. 256.

against the [lad’s] eating of the food [before an uncovered
*awra] and eating from the top of the dish, which are per­
missible, are merely orders of etiquette, for it is more appro­
priate on behalf of the host to observe them while eating
with his table-companion, instead of eating voraciously. [The
prophet] prohibited eating from the top of the dish because
God’s blessing descends on the top and it should continue
descending on it. So once he has eaten the food on the sides,it would be permissible to eat the top. If one is permitted
to walk along a road, he does so because it is permissible [in
principle], since nobody owns it, to forbid others from passing; S 352
but the Prophet prohibited halting for a certain specific
reason, for he said: “ It is the shelter of insects and a passage
for snakes,” not because halting is unlawful. He also pro­
hibited halting if the road were narrow and crowded, for if
one halts [for rest] others’ right of passing would be en­
croached upon.
171. Someone may ask: What is the difference between this
[kind of prohibition] and* the other?
172. [Shafi'i] replied: He to whom the proof is established
[concerning the validity of these orders] must know that the
Prophet prohibited [the acts] which I have just explained, and
he who acts contrary to them, despite his awareness of them,
would be regarded as disobedient and should ask God's for­
giveness and never repeat them again.
178.
He may ask: Such [a man] is disobedient, and since
you have already called [the man who violates]' the marriage 8553
and sale [contracts] disobedient in this [your] book, on what
ground have distinguished between the two?
174. [Shafi'i] replied: I made no distinction between the
two on the ground of disobedience, since I have regarded both
as disobedients, although certain acts of disobedience may be
greater than others.
175. He may ask: On what ground have you not regarded
as disobedient the man who wears the robe, eats from the
top of the dish and halts on the road, while you regarded
as disobedient the man who violates the marriage and sale
[contracts]?

178

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

176. [Shaft'!] replied: The first has been ordered to obey an
order of permission and has done so, so I have regarded as
lawful what was permitted and unlawful what was prohibited.
His disobedience to what was permitted would not render it
unlawful in all circumstances; but it prohibited him from
committing an act of disobedience.
177. He asked: For example?
178. [Shaft*!] replied: A man having a wife and a slavewoman is prohibited from intercourse with them whenever
they are menstruating or fasting; if he did, the intercourse
would be unlawful. However, neither is forbidden in other
circumstances, for they are in principle lawful to him.
179. Shaft*! said:12 One’s own property is forbidden in
principle to be taken by another, except in a lawful manner
which permits another to do so. [Similarly], women are for­
bidden to men except by marriage or ownership. So if one 848
makes a marriage contract with a forbidden [woman] or enters
into a sale transaction concerning forbidden [goods], such con­
tracts would be invalid, for what is forbidden cannot become
lawful by an unlawful act. The act which is in principle
forbidden remains so unless there is a specific text in the Book
or a sunna or consensus or the like [which make it lawful].
180. Shaft*! said:18 I have already given examples of [the
kind of] prohibitions which were not intended to be [on the
same footing as those] unlawful orders [specified] by indica­
tions which I do not want to repeat here. May God protect S355
us against error and grant us success.

[ON TRADITIONS]
Defects in the Traditions
181.
Shaft'! said: Someone has asked me: We find that
among the traditions from the Apostle some are in conformity S 210
with the Qur’an; others are in conformity only with the general
meaning of the Qur’an; and [still] others provide either speci­
fications additional to those of the Quranic text or legislation
on matters on which the Qur’an is silent.
Further, there are certain traditions which agree with one
another, and others which are contradictory to one another;
the abrogating and the abrogated traditions are clearly dis­
tinguished [in some of them]; in others the traditions which
are abrogating and abrogated are not indicated.
There are [certain traditions], consisting of orders of pro­
hibition by the Apostle, the obligation of which you have
regarded as binding, while there are others, consisting equally
of orders of prohibition, the obligation of which you have
regarded as optional.
We have noted that you have accepted certain contra­
dictory traditions but not others; and that you have applied S2U
analogical deduction on the strength of some of them only.
Your [method of] analogy, however, was discriminatory, for
you have applied it in some [cases], but not in others. On
what ground have you been applying analogy to some while
179

180

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

abandoning it in the case of others? Furthermore, you have
been disagreeing with other scholars—some of you have abandoned certain traditions in favor of others of equal or even
weaker status.
182. Shafi'i said: I have replied as follows:
The sunna which the Apostle has laid down on matters for
which a text is to be found in the Book of God is always in
full agreement with that text and clarifying on God’s behalf
a general text; the [Apostle's] specification is more explicit
than the text. But as for the sunna which he laid down on
matters for which a text is not found in the Book of God, the
obligation to accept them rests upon us by virtue of the duty
imposed by God to obey the [Prophet's] orders. As to the
abrogating and abrogated sunnas—like the abrogating com­
munications laid down by God to abrogate orders—they are
in like manner laid down by the Apostle so that each sunna
may be abrogated by another. And I have given him [the S21i
interlocutor] other examples which I have already discussed
in this book, in explanation of what I have just d escrib e d ^
As to contradictory traditions where no indications exist to
specify which is the abrogating and the abrogated, they are
all in accord with one another and contradiction does not
really exist among them. [For] the Apostle of God, being an
Arab by tongue arid by country, may have laid down a general
rule intended to be general and another general rule intended
to be particular, as I have already pointed out in my discus­
sion on the Book of God and the sunna of His Apostle. Or a
certain question may have been asked to which he gave a
certain concise answer, leading some of the transmitters to
relate the tradition in detail and ethers in brief/rendering
the meaning of the tradition partly clear and partly vague.
Or [it may happen] that the transmitter of a certain tradition
related- the answer he heard [from tue Prophet] without
knowing what the question had been, for [had he known] the
question he would have understood the answer clearly from 821
the reasoning on which the answer was based.
He [the Prophet] may have likewise laid down a sunna

s h Xf i 'I ’s

Risala

181

covering a particular situation and another covering a dif­
ferent one, but some of those who [related what they] heard
failed to distinguish between the two differing situations for
which he had laid down the sunnas. And he may have laid
down a sunna on a certain matter in conformity with the text
[of the Qur'an]—transmitted by one authority—and another
in one form in agreement with the text and in another contra­
dictory to it—owing to changes in the circumstances—trans-1
mitted by another authority; Hence the transmission by one
authority appeared to many as contradictory to the other,
while [in reality] no contradiction existed at all. He may
have also provided a sunna consisting of an order of per­
mission or prohibition the wording of which was general, and
he may have provided a second specifying sunna which made
evident that his order of prohibition was not intended to pro­
hibit what he made lawful, nor that his order of permission
made lawful what he had prohibited. For all possibilities of
this kind parallel examples exist in the Book of God, which
we have already described [in this book].
[Whenever] a certain sunna was abrogated by another [the
Prophet] never failed to indicate in the abrogating sunna what 8214
he had intended to abrogate. If certain transmitters have 8 30
overlooked some information concerning the abrogating and
abrogated sunnas, [at least] one must have transmitted what
the others did not, so that information concerning abrogations
was never entirely lacking.
All such matters, as I have already explained, were accepted
in accordance with what the sunna laid down and [men] knew
how to distinguish between the sunna in the same way that
[the Prophet] did, for obedience to his ruling distinguishing
the sunnas one from the other was obligatory and no one had
ever questioned that [the Prophet] did distinguish between
one sunna and another. .For if anyone says that the Prophet
made no distinction between one [sunna] and another he
would be ignorant [of what the Prophet said] or, what is 8215
worse, doubtful of it. Surely, obedience to God [imposes the
duty] of obedience to [the Prophet's orders].

182

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

The contradictory sunna is due either to incomplete trans­
mission rendering it contradictory, as I have explained before,
although what was lacking can be known from other [tradi­
tions], or it is the product of the transmitter's imagination.
No contradictory tradition [from the Prophet] is known to us
for which a possible explanation is lacking or the category
to which it belongs is not known, as I have already pointed out.
We may find [the answer], on the other hand, by the indi­
cation as to which of the contradictory traditions is the most
reliable; for if two contradictory traditions exist, they cannot
possess equal validity and only the reliable or authentic tradi­
tion should be accepted. The evidence as to which tradition
is authentic may be found either in the Book of God or in
the Prophet's sunna, on the strength of which we accept the
tradition for which the strongest evidence exist. However, we
have known of no two contradictory traditions for which we
could find neither explanation nor evidence as to which is
the authentic one, [either on the ground of] its conformity
with the Book or with other traditions or any other kind of
evidence.1
Hence whatever the Apostle has prohibited is unlawful
unless an evidence is found specifying that [his prohibition]
was not intended to condemn the matter as unlawful.
Finally, [Shafii] said, analogy [on the basis] of the sunna
falls into two categories, each subdivided into various forms.
183. He [the interlocutor] asked: What are they?
184. [Shafi‘1] replied: God'has imposed the obligation of
obedience upon men through His Book and His Prophet’s
tongue, in accordance with the obligation of obedience set
forth in His established judgment that men shall obey His
will without challenge to His command.2 The Apostle speci­
fied the meaning of what God made obligatory [in the tradi•

Shafi'i borrows, has been differently translated by different writers. Cf.

tionj or in any narrative transmitted from him so that nothing
is left unexplained and the scholars are under obligation to
regard this narrative [as authentic] as other traditions If it
expresses the identical meaning.* This [category of traditions] 8217
subdivided into many forms.
The second category of traditions consists of a general order
0f permission qualified by a particular order of prohibition,
jvfen should regard [all acts under] the general order of per­
mission as lawful and [the specific act under] the particular
order of prohibition as unlawful. But in so doing they should
not apply analogy to a particular order of prohibition, for the
general rule is that an order of permission and analogy must
be applied ordinarily on the general, not on the particular
rule. The same [rule] must apply if the general order is one
of prohibition and the particular order is one of permission,
or if [God] imposes a [general] duty and the Apostle qualified
it by a permission that is particular. Thus analogy is valid 8218
to us [only] on the evidence of the Book, the sunna and
precedents.
To have given an opinion contrary to an authentic tradition
from the Apostle is something, I hope, for which I shall never
be reproached. Nor has anyone the right to give such an
opinion. However, a man ignorant of a certain tradition may
give an opinion contrary to it by oversight or by a wrong
interpretation, without having intended to do so.
185? [Shafi'i] said: Someone may ask me: Give me an exam­
ple for eadi of the categories you have described, embodying
in a concise statement * all that I have inquired about, begin­
ning with the abrogating and abrogated sunnas of the Prophet,
citing some of it together with the Qur'an, even though you 8219
may be repeating some of what you have already discussed.
186.
[Shafi'i] replied: God ordered His Apostle to turn in
prayer first toward Jerusalem. So Jerusalem became the qibla
and as long as the Apostle faced that direction, to face any
other was unlawful. But ever since God abrogated tlu$ qibla
* Buiaq ed.. p. 34.
4Literally: " Avoiding a detailed treatment th a t I might forget."

184

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

toward Jerusalem arid ordered the Apostle and men to turn
toward the Ka'ba, the latter became obligatory in accordance
with the text {of the Book] and no other qibla should be faced
save in case of fear [of danger]. It became absolutely unlawful
to turn toward Jerusalem. Each [qibla] was valid in its time:
Jerusalem from the time when the Prophet turned toward it
until he was ordered to change, and the Sacred House [Ka'ba]
from thence forward until the Day of Resurrection. All the
other abrogated [communications], whether in the Book of
God or the sunna, have in like manner been laid down.
187. [Shaft7] said: Such [a process of] abrogation is an evi­
dence that whenever the Prophet laid down a sunna which
God ordered him to revise, he laid down another sunna which bh
men were ordered to obey in place of the earlier one so that
they would no longer obey the abrogated sunna. Thus no
one, except those unversed in the Arab tongue and in the
[legal] knowledge concerning the place of the sunna in its
relation to the Book (that it specified the meaning of the
Book), should ever suppose [from the internal evidence of the
sunna] that the Book abrogates the sunna.9
188. He asked: Would it be possible for the sunna to con­
tradict the Book [of God]?
189. [Shaft'!] replied: Impossible! For God, glorified be
His praise, imposed on men the obligation [of obedience to
the law] through ,two avenues—the origin of both is in the
Rook~-His Book and the sunna: [The latter is binding by
virtue of] the duty of obedience laid down in the Book that
it should be followed. So it was not permissible for the Apos­
tle to allow the sunna to be abrogated [by the Book], without
[the Apostle himself] providing another sunna to abrogate it.
The abrogating sunna is known because it is the later one, $z
while most of the abrogating [communications] of the Book
can be known only by [indications provided in] the Sunna of
the Apostle.
So if the sunna [itself] indicates what the abrogating [com­
munications] of the Book are and distinguishes between the
See Chap. VI, above.

s h a f iT

185

abrogating and the abrogated, it cannot be abrogated by the
Q u r 'a n unless the Apostle himself provides another sunna—
jn conformity with the Qur’an—which would abrogate an
earlier sunna. Thus no doubt should ever remain in the
minds of men that God has imposed the duty of obedience
[to the Prophet].
190. He asked: Someone may say: If we find in the Qur’an
an explicit general meaning which a certain sunna may either
make specific or to which it may give an implicit meaning that
ts contradictory, do you [not] agree that the sunna [in such a
case] is abrogated by the Qur'an?
191. [Shafi'i] replied: No scholar should ever hold such an
opinionl
192. He asked: Why?
193. [Shafi'i] replied: Since God has imposed on His Prophet
the duty to obey His communications to him, and He testified
to his [right] guidance and imposed on men the duty to obey
him, and since the Arab tongue—as I have already explained—
may give a variety of meanings [for each word] so that some
of the communications of the Book are general and intended
to be particular and others particular and intended to be
general, and some are general duties which the Apostfe speci­
fied [in the sunna]—a function which the sunna fulfils in its
relation to the Book, the sunna cannot be contradictory to the
Book of God, but will always follow the Book of God, in
conformity with His divine communication, and clarify on
God’s behalf the meaning intended by God. Thus [the sunna]
always follows the Book of God.
194. He asked: Will you give an evidence in support of
your opinion from the Qur’an?
195. [Shafi'i replied]: I quoted for him a part [of the argu­
ment] embodied in [my] book “ The [Conformity of the]
Sunna to the Qur’a n ” * that God has imposed the duties of
prayer, alms, and pilgrimage; but the Apostle specified the
modes of performing the prayer, the number of prayers and
•T his is a reference to a book which has not come down to us, but
none of ShSfiTs biographers have mentioned it either.

186

ISLAMIC j u r i s p r u d e n c e

the time for performing them each day and the rules [govern­
ing performance]; he specified the amount of the alms to be
paid, the time of payment and the commodities exempted
therefrom; and [he specified] the performance of pilgrimage
and the rules as to what is permitted and what should be
avoided. I have also cited to him God’s saying:
As for the thief, male and female, cut off their hands [Q. V, 42].
And:
The fornicatress and ‘the fornicator—scourge each one of them
with a hundred stripes [Q. XXIV, 2],
And I pointed out that since the Apostle laid down in the
sunna that cutting off the hand is the penalty for theft if the
amount exceeds a quarter of a dinar, and that the penalty of
scourging [for fornication] on the part of unmarried free and
adult persons—not free married or slave married persons—the
sunna indicated that God implied [in the text of the Qur’an]
a particular [category of] adulterers and thieves despite the
fact that the literal [meaning of the] communication is ap­
parently general concerning the [penalty for] thieves and
adulterers.
196, He said: I am in agreement with what you have just
explained; but can you give an evidence against those who
related a saying on the authority of the Prophet which runs
as follows:
Compare whatever is related on my authority with the Book of
God; if it agrees with it, I have said it, but if it does not agree,
I have not said it.*
197. [Shaft*!] replied: This tradition was not related by one
whose authority on any matter, significant or insignificant, has
been recognized so as to constitute a proof for what he related.
’ This tradition has been transmitted in a variety of forms and is
regarded as weak. For a critical evaluation, see Ibn Hazm, Kitab al-Ihkam
FI Uf&l al-Ahk&m, Vol. II, pp. 76-82. See also Shakir's edition of the
Risala, p. 224, n. 4; and J. Schacht, Origins of Muhammadan Juris­
prudence, p. 28.

187

Besides, that is an Interrupted transmission from an unknown
person and is unacceptable to us.
198. He asked: Was anything related on the authority of
the Prophet in support of your opinion?
199. [Shaft*!] replied: Yes. For Sufyan [b* *Uyayna] told us
from Salim Abu al-Nadr from *Ubayd b. Abl Raft* from his
father that the Prophet said:

8225

“ Let me find no one of you reclining on his couch, who, when
confronted with an order of permission or prohibition from me,
says: *I do no know [whether this is obligatory or not]; we will
follow only what we find in the Book of God.' 8
So * the Apostle urged men never to reject his orders, on
the grounds that God imposed the duty that they should obey
his orders.
200. He asked: Will you give an example of general com­
munications on which the scholars, or the majority at least,
have agreed with you that the sunnas, together with the Book,
give an indication that such a communication is intended to
be particular, although its literal meaning is general?
201. [Shaft*!] replied: Yes; it is as I have already discussed
in this book.
202. He asked: Repeat some portion of it.
203. [Shaft*!] replied: God said:
Forbidden to you are your mothers and daughters, your .sisters,
your aunts, paternal and maternal,.,your brothers’ daughters, your
sister's daughters, your mothers who have given suck to you, your
suckling sisters, your wives’ mothers, your step-daughters, who are
in your care being born of your wives you have been into—but if
you have not yet been into them, it is no fault, in you—and the
spouses of your sons who are of your loins, and that you should
take to you two sisters together, unless it be a thing of the past;
God is All-forgiving, All-compassionate; and wedded women
except what your right hands possess. So God prescribes for you.
And lawful for you is what is beyond that [Q. IV, 27-28].
*See paragraph 94, n. 15, above.
*“ Shafil said " is omitted.

8226

188

ISLAMIC JU R ISP RUD ENC E

So * God stipulated what He prohibited and added: “ Lawful
for you is what is beyond that ”; but the Apostle specified that
no woman together with an aunt, paternal or maternal, shall
be taken as a wife.10 I know of no one who has disagreed with
that specification.
There are two indications in that [tradition]: First, that the
sunna of the Apostle can contradict the Book of God in no
circumstance, but can only specify the general and particular
communications of that Book. Second, that [the scholars]
have accepted that [tradition] on the authority of a single
transmitter. But I know of no transmitter other than Abu
Hurayra who correctly related it on the authority of the
Prophet.11
204. He asked: Would it be possible in your opinion to
regard this tradition as contradictory to any literal meaning
in the Book [of God]?
205. [ShafiTj replied: Neither this [tradition] nor any other
[can be contradictory to the Book of God],
206. He asked: What is, therefore, the meaning of God’s
saying: “ Forbidden to you are your mothers,” in which he
stipulated the prohibition, and then added: “ Lawful for you
is what is beyond that ” [Q. IV, 27]?
207. [Shafi'i] replied: God stipulated the instances [of
women] forbidden in all circumstances, such as mothers,
daughters, sisters, aunts—paternal and maternal—, the brother’s
daughters and the sister’s daughters; those forbidden in all
circumstances on the basis of kinship and suckling; and those
forbidden to be taken with others, although if each were taken
separately it would be lawful. So God’s saying: ” Lawful for
you is what is beyond that,” means that any woman is lawful
in permissible circumstance; for the stipulation “ lawful etc.,”
means marriage in a lawful manner, not taking a wife in an

illegal marriage, or the taking of a fifth wife in addition to
the other four, or the taking of two sisters or any other
[woman] who is in a forbidden category.
I have also given him the [example of the] duty of ablution
laid down by God, and the Prophet’s [precedent of] wiping
the shoes, and the agreement of the majority of the learned,
on the acceptance of wiping.
208. He asked: Is [the Prophet’s] wiping contradictory to
any [textual communication] in the Qur'an?
209. [Shaft'!] replied: In no circumstance can the surina
contradict the Qur’an.
210. He asked: How would you explain it?
211. [Shaft*!] replied: Since [God] said:
When you stand up for the prayer, wash your faces and your
hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet up
to the ankles [Q. V, 8J.

\

8229

The sunna specified that whoever is in a state of purity,
and who has not [subsequently become] polluted, is under
no obligation to fulfil this duty [of washing the face, etc.]
when he stands up in prayer; it also specified that the duty of
washing the feet is obligatory only on him who had not worn 8 230
the two shoes in complete purity.
I have also given him the [example of the] Prophet's pro­
hibition of [eating the meat of] beasts possessing fangs. For
God stipulated:
Say; 1 do not find, in what is revealed to me, anything forbidden
to one who eats of it, unless it be a dead animal or blood out­
poured, or the flesh of the swine—for it is abomination—or an
impious thing over which the name of a god other than God has
been involved; but if one is compelled, not willingly or trans­
gressing—then verily thy Lord is All-forgiving, All-compassionate
[Q. VI, 146]; and specified what He prohibited.12
212. He asked: What is the meaning of this [communica­
tion]?
218.
[Shaft*!] replied: The meaning of " Say: I do not
find . . . forbidden, etc. . .
is that nothing was forbidden
18 See also Q. VI, 147-48.

190

ISLAMIC JUR ISP RUD ENC E

of what men were accustomed to eat save a dead animal,
etc. . . . but what was regarded as forbidden should not be
forbidden unless God or the sunna so stipulated in accordance
with God’s saying: " Making lawful for them.the good things
and unlawful the corrupt things ” [Q. VII, 156]; so it is not
just forbidden because the food was spoiled.
214. [Shafi‘1] said: Further, I cited to him God’s saying:
God has permitted sale and forbidden usury [Q. II, 276].
And His saying:
Do not consume your property among you in vanity, except there
be trading by mutual consent on your part [Q. IV, 33].
The Apostle of God, however, has forbidden certain kinds
of sales, such as the exchange of [gold] dinars for [silver]
dirhams for a specified time as well as others, and the Muslims,
following the Apostle of God, have forbidden them, too,
although these [transactions] and others are not contradictory
to the Book of God.
215. He asked: Define for me the meaning of what you
have said in a more comprehensive and concise manner.
216. [Shafi'I] replied: Since it is evident in the Book of
God that God placed His Apostle in the position of a mouth­
piece [and an interpreter] on God’s behalf and imposed on
men the duty to obey his orders, therefore when He said:
“ God has permitted sale and forbidden usury/’ He meant
that He permitted the [kind of] sale which was neither for­
bidden in His Book nor through the tongue of His Prophet.
In like manner His saying: “ And lawful for you is what is
beyond th a t" [Q. IV, 28], means that God permitted the
taking of women in lawful marriage as well as “ what your
right hand possessesM in accordance with His Book;18 it is
not an unqualified permission. This is clear Arabic speech.
217. Shafii said :14 [In my reply] I have added the fob
18 Milk al-yamln, in the singular, is a citation from the Q ur'an con­
cerning the taking of four lawful wives and what “ your right hands
possess " [Q. IV, 3].

lowing: If it were permissible to abandon a tradition in place
of the opinion of those who are ignorant of its place in rela­
tion to the Book, we would have abandoned" the wiping of
the shoes—which we have already explained—and we would
have permitted everything that comes under sale, as well as
taking as wives a woman together with her paternal and
maternal aunts, and the eating of beasts possessing fangs and
the like. It would also have been permissible to hold the
opinion that the Prophet laid down the sunna concerning the
cutting off of the thief's hand if the value of the stolen article
exceeds a quarter of a dinar before the divine communication:
" The thief, male and female, cut off their hands ” [Q. V, 42]
was revealed. So everyone in this category would have his
hands cut off.
In like manner it would be permissible to maintain that
the Prophet decreed the stoning of the thayyib woman [as
penalty for adultery] before he received the communication:
“ The fornicatress and the fornicator—scourge each one of
them a hundred stripes ” [Q. XXIV, 2], which meant that [the
penalty] for the unmarried and thayyib women would have
been scourging, not stoning to death.
It would also have been permissible to maintain that all
[the kinds of] sale forbidden by the Apostle had been for­
bidden before the divine communication “ God has permitted
sale and forbidden usury (al*riba) *' was revealed, and that
thereafter they became lawful. Usury [may be found] when
a man is indebted to another, and the debt is due, and [the
second] says [to the first]: Would you pay the debt or pay [in
addition] the usury? Payment would be postponed, [in the
latter event,] but the debt would grow larger.
Other examples parallel to it might be given. However, he
who holds such an opinion would invalidate most of the
sunnas of the Apostle; but such an opinion betrays ignorance
indeedl
218. He said: That is correct.
219. [Shafi‘i said]: The sunna of the Apostle is [obligatory]
as I have already explained, and he who holds an opinion

different from what I have stated, betrays a lack of knowledge
about the sunna mixed with a false opinion on ,a subject in
which he is ignorant.
220. He asked: Will you cite another example of a sunna
abrogated by another?
221. [Shaft'?] replied: The abrogating and abrogated sunnas
may be found in various places [of this book] and to repeat
them here would take a long time.
222. He asked: Perhaps a few would be enough; will you
cite them briefly and clearly?
223. [Shaft*!] replied: Malik [b. Anas] told us from 'AbdAllah b. Abl Bakr b. Muhammad b. ‘Amr b. IJazm from *AbdAllah b. Waqid from 'Abd-Allah b. *Umar who said:
The Apostle of God prohibited the eating of the meat of sacri*
fice after three days [from the first Day of Sacrifice].15
*
Abd-Allah b. Abi Bakr said that he cited this [tradition]
*Amra, daughter of *Abd al-Rahman,ie who said: T hat is true,
I have heard 'A'isha say:
A few people from the desert came [to Makka] during the Day
of Sacrifice in the time of the Prophet, who said: *You may pre­
serve [the meat of sacrifice] for three days and give the rest to
the poor.’ She said [a year] later the Prophet was asked: ‘O
Apostle of God! men were accustomed to make use of their sacri­
fices: They took its fat and used its [skins] to carry water.' So
the Apostle inquired: 'Why not?.’ You have prohibited pre­
serving the meat of the sacrifice after three days,' they replied.
*I have prohibited that only for the sake of those who came
[to the city] during the Day of Sacrifice. Surely you may eat of it;
give to the poor and preserve the rest.’17
We are also told by [Sufyan] b. *Uyayna from [Sa*d b. *Ubayd]
al-Zuhri from Abi *Ubayd, freed-slave of Ibn Azhar, who said:
16
Sacrifices begin on the first day of the Great Feast. For the rules

I have witnessed the Feast [of Sacrifice] with ‘All b. Abi Talib
whom I have heard saying: ' Nobody should eat from the meat
of Sacrifice after three days.'18
And we are told by the trusted authority19 from Ma'mar
from al-Zuhri from Abu ‘Ubayd from ‘All who said:

$236

The Apostle of God said: ‘ Nobody should eat from the meat
of Sacrifice after three days.’ 20
Ibn ‘Uyayna also told us from Ibrahim b. Maysara who said:
I have heard Anas b. Malik say: We were accustomed to
slaughter our sacrifices and preserve the remaining portion of it
[for our journeys] to Basra.21
224.
Shafi'i said: These traditions include many meanings
[from which we may draw several conclusions], [First,] the S 237
tradition transmitted by *Ali from the Prophet is in agreement
with that of *Abd-Allah b. Waqid concerning the Prophet’s
prohibition against keeping the meat of sacrifice after three
days. [Second,] there is an indication that ‘All heard the order
of prohibition from the Prophet and that this order reached
*Abd-Allah b. Waqid. [Third,] there is an indication that the
Prophet's permission failed to reach both ‘All and ‘Afyd-AIlah
b. Waqid, for had it reached them, they would have ceased
to relate the order of prohibition, which was abrogated/and
would have followed the order of permission which had
become the abrogating [order]. [For if] the abrogated order
of prohibition were known to them they would not have
disregarded the abrogating order [of permission]. [Finally,]
the opinion of Anas that they were accustomed to enter Ba$ra
,a This tradition is regarded as weak owing to interruption in the chain
of authorities, but its content is in agreement with similar traditions. See
Ibn IJanbal, Vol. II, p. 297, no. 1235191. e., Yahya b. IJassan.
M $h5fi'I fails to mention the name of his authority, but Ibn IJanbal
gives the name of ‘Abd al-RazzSq. See Ibn Hanbal, Vol. II, p. 282. In
another version of the tradition he gives the name of Muhammad b.
Ja'far. Ibid.%Vol. II, p. 280; al-tfaziml, p. 120.
•* al-Hlziml, p. 121.

with the meat of the sacrifices may mean either that Anas had
heard the order of permission but not the earlier order of
prohibition—thus he acted on the order of permission without
knowing the order of prohibition—or he may have heard both,
but since the order of prohibition was abrogated, he failed to
mention it. So each one of the two conflicting transmitters
related what he had known. Thus it is obligatory on everyone
who has heard anything from the Apostle of God, or related
on his authority, to transmit what he had heard for the in*
formation of others.
225.
Shafi’i said: Since *A‘isha related from the Prophet
first the order of prohibition concerning the keeping of the
meat of sacrifice after three days and then the order of per­
mission, and the Apostle’s [reason] that he gave the order of
prohibition for the sake of those who came from the desert—
the complete tradition related by ‘A’isha from the Prophet is
that which should include the first and the last parts, as well
as the reason for the orders of prohibition and permission.
It is obligatory on all who have known about it to follow it.
*A*isha’s tradition is one of the clearest examples of the
abrogating and abrogated sunnas. It also illustrates how a
tradition may be split so that only a portion of it—not all—
was related by one authority and another portion by others,
each relating what he had remembered.
The order of permission concerning the keeping of the meat
of sacrifice, eating it, and giving it to the poor may have only
one of two meanings, each depending on one of two circum­
stances: Whenever the people of the desert enter [the city],
the order of prohibition concerning the keeping of the meat
after three days becomes obligatory; but if none should come,
the order of permission is valid concerning eating, preserving,
giving to the poor, and carrying it [on a journey]. It may also
mean that the order of prohibition concerning the keeping
of the meat after three days was abrogated—despite any [special]
circumstance—so men can keep a portion of the meat after
three days or give another to the poor.**

226. [Shaft*! said]: Muhammad b. Isma*!I b. Abi Fudayk
told us from Ibn Abi Dhi’b from al-Maqburl-from *Abd al*
Rahman b. Abi Sa’Id [al-Khudri] from Abu $a‘!d al-Khudr!
who said:

We were withheld from performing prayer in [the battle of] the
Trench for a long while, till pate at] night, but when we were
relieved from fighting—as God said: *God relieved the believers
of fighting, God is All-strong, All-mighty ’ [Q. XXXIII, 25]—the
Apostle ordered Bilal [to call the believers to prayer] and per­
formed the noon-prayer as fully as If it were performed in its
time, and performed the ‘asr, the sunset, and the evening prayers
in like manner. This [incident] took place before the communi­
cation concerning fear-prayer was revealed which runs as follows:
' If you fear [danger], pray either on foot or mounted/ [Q. II,
240].28

227. Shaft*! said: Since Abu Sa*fd related that the Apostle’s
prayer in the battle of the Trench was performed before the
communication on fear-prayer (if you fear, etc.) was revealed1,
we concluded that the performance of fear-prayer took place
after that time, for Abu Sa‘id was present [at the battle] and
related the tradition concerning the deferment of prayers after
their usual times24 and stated that this [case] took place
before the communication on fear-prayer was revealed.
228. [Shaft*!] said: Thus in no circumstances shall fearprayer be deferred from its usual time in the town, nor in
another at another time. See his I k h t i l d f a i - H a d i t h (on the margin of
the K i t d b al-Umm, Vol. VII, pp. 136-87, 247-48). Thus the matter was
left undecided for further interpretations and the schools vary on this
matter. See Shakir’s ed., pp. 240-41, n. S.

performing [two] prayers at one time in travel, whether [men
are] in fear [of danger] or not. Prayers must always be per­
formed in the same manner as performed by the Apostle
of God.
Our opinion concerning fear-prayer is based on what Malik
[b. Anas] told us from Yazid b. Ruman from Salih b. Khawwat
from men who performed the fear-prayer with the Apostle in
the campaign of Dhat al-Riqa* who said:
A company [of believers] stood in rank [for prayer] with [the
Prophet] while another watched the enemy. He performed one
cycle with the company who stood with him and remained
standing until the others completed [the prayer]. Having thus
taken the position of those facing the enemy, the other company
stood [with the Prophet], who performed the other cycle and
remained sitting while the company completed their prayer until
he uttered the salutation with them.25
229.
[Shaft*!] said: We have been told by men who heard
‘Abd-Allah b. ‘Umar b. FJafs relating on the authority of his
brother ‘Ubayd-Allah b. ‘Umar from aI*Qasim b. Muhammad
from Salih b. Khawwat b. Jubayr from his father from the
Prophet a similar tradition. I t 25 has also been related that
the Prophet performed a fear-prayer differently from what
Malik had stated. We have, however, accepted [Malik’s] version,
because it is more consistent with the Qur'an and more de­
ceptive to the enemy. This subject and the contradictory
traditions related to it have been discussed in the Kitab ah
$atah [Book of Prayer].27 We have dispensed with opposing
views on this tradition since they are scattered in [the various
chapters of] our books.

230. [Shaft*! said]: God, Blessed and Most High, said:
Those of your women who commit indecency, call four witnesses
against them, and if they testify—then detain them in their houses
until death takes them, or God appoints for them a way out.
And when-, two of you commit indecency, punish them both;
but if they repent and reform, then let them [Q. IV, 19-20].

The punishment for the two adulterers, according to this
communication, was detainment and suffering; but since God
has communicated to His Apostle that the penalty for fornica­
tion shall be: “ The fornicatress and fornicator—scourge each
one of them with a hundred stripes ” [Q. XXIV, 2], and for
the slave-woman shall be: “ If then, having been taken under
ihsan, they commit art indecency, they shall be liable to half
the punishment of freewomen ” [Q. IV, 30], detainment as a
punishment for adulterers has been abrogated, but punish­
ment [by suffering] was confirmed.
As to the communication concerning the punishment of
slave-women that " they shall be liable to half the punishment
of freewomen,” God has obviously drawn a distinction between
the punishment of slave- and free women: He made it evident
that half [of the punishment] cannot be other than scourging,
for only scourging can be halved by the number of stripes
while stoning to death cannot be halved, since death might
be caused either by the casting of one or by a thousand stones.
So what is incapable of being halved cannot be regarded as
penalty, and death certainly cannot be halved by dividing the
number of stones cast at the person.*8
God’s communication: “ The fornicatress and the forni­
cator-scourge each one of them with a hundred stripes ” [Q
XXIV, 2] may either mean as a penalty to all free adulterers,
or to some to the exclusion of the others; but the sunna of the
Apostle specified who is liable for such a penalty. For 'Abd
al-Wahhab al-Thaqafi told us from Yunus b. ‘Ubayd from
al-Hasan from ‘Ubada b. al-§amit that the Apostle of God said:
18 See paragraph 123, above.

Take it from me [repeated-twice] God has decided on a way [for
their punishment]: For the fornication of the unmarried couple
[the penalty] is scourging with a hundred stripes and banishment
for a year; for [the adultery of] the married couple, scourging
with a hundred stripes and stoning [to death].28

231.
[Shaft*!] said: The Apostle’s saying that “ God has de­
cided on a way [for their punishment] ” indicates that this was
the first penalty imposed on adulterers in accordance with
God’s communication “ until death takes them or God appoints
S 247
for them a way out ” [Q. IV, 19].30
Since the Apostle ordered the stoning of both Ma'iz and the
wife of al-AsIaml rather than scourging them, the sunna made
it evident that scourging [as a penalty] for fornication by the
unmarried was abrogated.31 For no such distinction in the
penalty of freemen was ever made before except in the case of
women under ih$an whether by marriage or otherwise. But
the Prophet’s saying that “ God has decided on a way for their
punishment, etc. . . is an indication that the first [penalty]
abrogated was banishment, and that any other kind of punish­
ment must have been imposed later, since the penalty of
banishment was imposed first. [For] Malik [b. Anas] told us
from Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri from TJbayd-AUah b. *Abd-Allah
S 248
b . ’Utba from Abu Hurayra and Zayd b. Khalid who said:
Two men submitted a dispute to the Apostle of God. One of
them said: *O Apostle of God! Will you settle our dispute on
the basis of the Book of God? ’ The other, who was more
knowledgeable in the law, said: ‘ I concur, O Apostle, but I beg
you to let me speak [first].*"' *You may speak,’ replied [the Prophet],
He said: ‘ When my son was in the employment of this [the
plaintiff] he committed adultery with his wife. I was told that
my son’s penalty was stoning [to death]; but instead I paid a
ransom of one hundred sheep and a slave-woman. Upon inquiry
from those who are learned in the law, I have found that my
son’s penalty was a hundred stripes and banishment for a year,
while the penalty for his [the plaintiff’s] wife was stoning.* *By

i that the son should be scourged by a hundred stripes ^nd banished

7 woman confessed and was stoned [to death].*2

S 249

Malik [b. Anas] told us from lbn 'Umar that the Prophet
ordered the stoning of two jews for committing adultery.83

232. [Shafi'i] said: Thus the scourging of a hundred stripes
and banishment were confirmed [as a penalty] for fornication
on the part of the unmarried, and stoning for the married.
But if punishment by scourging is imposed [on the two forni­
cators,] it should not be enforced together with stoning since
the latter was abrogated; for if [the culprits] were regarded as
married-therefore not liable for scourging—their penalty
should be that imposed on married adulterers.8*
[The communication concerning] the penalty of stoning for
the two married adulterers was revealed after that concerning
scourging according to the Apostle, who made that [clear] on
God's behalf. This is the meaning most consistent [with the
Book of God] and most appropriate in our opinion. But God

stand, too; if he bows you should bow; if he raises his hands,
you should raise them; if he says: ‘ God listens to him who
praises Him,' you should say: ‘ Praise be to you, Our Lord and
if he performs his prayer sitting, you should perform yours sitting,
too/ ”
Malik [b. Anas] told us from Hisham b. ‘Urwa from his
father from ‘A'isha, who said:
When the Apostle was sick, he performed his prayer sitting in
his house; but when the men behind him performed their prayer
standing, he ordered them to sit. After prayer, [the Prophet]
said: 'The imam is expected to be followed; if lie bows, you
should bow; if he raises his hand, you should raise yours, too;
if he sits, you should sit all together.’8T
This tradition, related by Anas [b. Malik], is like the previous
one, but the meaning of Anas' tradition is clearer.
Malik [b. Anas] told us from Hisham b. ‘Urwa from his
father, who said:
The Apostle of God went out [from his house] while still sick
[to perform his prayer in public]. While leading the prayer, Abti
Bakr stepped aside [in favor of the Prophet], but the latter
ordered him to continue and sat beside him: Abu Bakr followed
the Apostle [in his prayer], and men followed Abu Bakr.38
Shafi'i said that he was in favor of the opinion expressed
in this tradition.8*

technique of prayer to perform the formalized recitals and postures. See

permitting men to perform prayer sitting at the time of his
fall from the horse was abrogated by his later order that they
may perform prayer standing, because they [should] sit when
the imam sits.41
Thus the evidence of the sunna and the consensus of the
people [i. e., of the scholars] indicate that prayers should be
performed standing when men are able to stand, and sitting
when they are unable to stand; but those who can perform it
standing by themselves should never do so sitting.
Although the Prophet’s sunna ordering men to perform
their prayer behind him standing while he performed it sitting
during his [death] sickness abrogated his previous sunna, it is
in conformity with his sunna concerning the prayers of healthy
and sick men, as well as the consensus of the people, that
each man should fulfil his [prayer] duty in accordance with
the rule stipulating that the sick man can perform his
prayer sitting behind a healthy imam who performs the prayer
standing.
So we maintain: [If sick,] the imam performs his prayer
sitting, but the healthy men behind him should perform theirs
standing. So each one fulfils his duty in his own way, although
it is more appropriate if the imam deputizes another person
[whenever he is sick].42

[Shafi'i] said: There are other parallel examples con- **

in this book and in [the chapters on] the Qur’an and the

[Contradictory Traditions]
238. [Shafi'i] said: He asked: Give examples of contradictory
traditions in which no indications are to be found concerning
the abrogating and abrogated [sunnas] and the reason for
accepting some and rejecting others?
239. [Shafi'i] replied: I have already cited a tradition to the
effect that the Apostle performed the fear-prayer in the cam­
paign of Dhat al-Riqa*, in which he performed one cycle with
one company while the other watched the enemy, etc. How­
ever,4* Ibn 'Umar related from the Prophet that he [the
Prophet] performed the fear-prayer somewhat differently as
follows:
H e [the P rophet] perform ed one cycle w ith one com pany while
ano th er stood [for protection] betw een him and the enemy. The
com pany that stood in rank [for prayer] replaced the one which
had not prayed, taking a position between him [the Prophet] and
against all the Hanafi and MiiikS-. jurists. For differences between Shafi'i
and' Mllik, see Shafi'i, K i l a b a l - U m m , Vol. VII. pp. 184-86.

Abu ‘Ayyash al-Zuraqi related:
T h e P rop h et perform ed a [fear]-prayer in the cam paign of
‘Usfan *8 while K halid b. al-W alid [and his army] stood between
him an d the q ib la [watching the enem y]. H e [the Prophet] stood

Jabir related [a tradition] the meaning of which is nearly
identical to that one.80 O th er81 contradictory traditions may
be cited, but they are unreliable.
240. Someone has asked me: Why have you accepted [the
tradition concerning] the Prophet's prayer in the campaign
of Dhat al-Riqa* to the exclusion of others?
241. [Shaft*!] replied: I would accept the tradition of Abu
•Ayyash and Jabir concerning fear-prayer if the reason given
there for the Prophet’s prayer were the same as that in the
other [i. e., the tradition of Dhat al-Riqa*].
242. He asked: What is it?
243. [Shafi't] replied: The Apostle had under his command
1,400 men, while Khalid b. al-Walfd had only 200. Far away
in the desert, [Khalid] was secure from attack owing both to
the few under his command and the many under the Apostle’s
command. For if the enemy attacked [Khalid], they could be
seen [by the Prophet] while performing the bowing as he was
in such a position that they were always seen by him. How­
ever, if the enemy consisted of only a few and were at a dis47 Cf. paragraph 149, above.

tance, and no company stood between them [and those who
performed the prayer], I am of the opinion that fear-prayer
should be performed in such circumstances, as I explained
before.
244. He asked: I realize that owing to changes in circum­
stances the tradition concerning the prayer of Dhat al-Riqa*
is in agreement [with your opinion]; why are you opposed to
the tradition of Ibn ‘Umar?
245. [Shaft1!] replied: [The tradition of Dhat al-Riqa*] was
related by Khawwat b. Jubayr. A not very different one was
related by Sahl b. Abi Hathma. Moreover, ‘All b. Abl 7'alib
was reported to have performed the fear-prayer in the Night
of al-Harir,52 in accordance with the tradition related by
Khawwat b. Jubayr from the Prophet. Finally, Khawwat was
an old and early companion of the Prophet.
246. He asked: Is there any evidence [for accepting Khaw­
wat’s tradition] stronger than his [age and] early companion­
ship?
247. [Shaft*!] replied: Yes, it is its consistency with the
meaning of the Book of God, as I have already explained.
248. He asked: What part of it is consistent with the Book
of God?
249. [Shaft*!] replied: God* said:
W hen thou art w ith them and hast set up the prayer for them,
let a party of them stand w ith thee, and let them take their
weapons. W hen they bow, le t them be behind you; an d then
let another party w ho has not prayed come and pray w ith thee,
taking their guard an d their weapons. T h e unbelievers wish th at
you should neglect your w eapons and your baggage, th en they
would fall upon you all at once. T h e re is no fault in you, if
rain molests you, or you are sick, to lay dow n your weapons, b u t
keep your guard [Q. IV, 103}.

And He said:
W hen you feel’ secure again, observe the prayer.

Verily, the

and Mu'&wiya, then governor of Syria.

prayer has become for the believer a thing prescribed for stated
times [Q. IV, 104].

The meaning implied [in these texts] is that when men are
they should perform their [usual] prayer. But God
knows bestl
Since God has distinguished between fear and secure prayers
in order to protect the followers of His religion from a sudden
attack, we have found that by comparing the tradition of
Khawwat b. Jubayr with others contradictory to it, fChawwat's
tradition seems to be more appropriate to follow for pre­
cautionary [considerations]. It is recommended that the two
parties should participate equally [in performing the prayer
and in guarding against the enemy], for the party that per­
forms the prayer first with the imam should be well guarded
bv the other which does not perform the prayer. The guarding
party—relieved of the duty of prayer—should be fully occupied
[in watching the enemy], whether standing or sitting, turning
left or right, and prepared to defend should the-enemy attack,
giving warning whenever the enemy suddenly attacks and
being ready to fight if necessary, never moving from their
position between the 'enemy and the party performing the
prayer. The imam should quickly perform the prayer if he
fears a sudden attack by the enemy, upon a warning from the
guarding party.
250. [Shafi‘1] said: Both parties are equally fight in fulfilling
their duties, for in accordance with the tradition of Khawwat,
both are equally responsible. Each one, after it has performed
its prayer, guards the other; thus each takes the place of the
other fulfilling its duties. Such [a division of responsibility]
is just.
251. [Shafi'I] said: The tradition contradictory to that of
Khawwat does not provide for such precaution, since one of
the two parties protects the other only during one cycle while
the other takes the place of the first in order to guard it before
completing its prayer, so that when they were performing their
prayer together they did not have any protection at all. So
the only one who fully performed his prayer was the imam,

secure,

S 264

206

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

who did not take part in guarding nor could he be stron
enough to guard [against the enemy]. This [kind of perforrtf
ance] is inconsistent with the order of precaution and pre
paredness against the enemy. Yet God has made it plain that
He distinguished between the fear-prayer and other praye^
so that the followers of His religion should not be exposed
to a sudden stack by the enemy and that neither party should
be held responsible more than the other. We note that God
made no stipulation that either the imam or the two parties
should perform substitution prayers. This indicates that the
imam and the men following him have equally fulfilled their
duty. This is [clearly shown] in Khawwat's tradition, but not
in the one contradictory to it.
252. He asked: Is there any other meaning in the tradition
unacceptable to you which you have not described?
253. [Shafi’i] replied: Yes. [The tradition] may mean that
if it is permissible to perform the fear-prayer in a manner
different from other, prayers, it should be permissible to per­
form it in whatever manner is possible, depending on the
circumstances in which [the Muslims] or the enemy happen
to be, provided the number [of cycles] is completed, even
though [the mode of] performance may he different, but all
[such performances] fulfil the duty.

Another Kind of Contradictory [Traditions]
251. Sfjafi'fsaid: Someone has asked me: Traditions relating
to the tashahhud 53 have been differently transmitted from the
Prophet. Ibn Mas'ud related that he [the Prophet] instructed
men how to recite the tashahhud just as he instructed them
to recite a portion 5i of the Qur’an, beginning with the three
•* The tashabhud is (hr recital of the salutations to the Prophet and
the formula of the profession of the faith.
“ Literally: '* T he sura {chapter] of the Qur'an.”

words: Salutations to God.5a Which [tradition of] tashahhud
have you accepted?
255. Shafi'i replied: Malik, [b. Anas] told us from Ibn Shihab
from *Urwa [b. al-Zubayr] from 'Abd al-Rahtnan b. \Abd
al-Qarl who heard 'Umar b. al-Khat^ab on the pulpit in­
structing men how to recite the tashahhud say:
Say: Salutations to God. Sanctities belong to God. Goodness an d
prayers to God. O Prophet, peace is upon you and G od’s blessings
and mercies to you. Peace is upon us and upon all good servants'
of God. I profess that there is no god at all but God, a n d I
witness that M uham m ad is His serva'nt and Apostle,*9

256. Shafi'i said: This is the tradition in which our learned
predecessors have instructed us in our early age. We have
known that tradition, including the names of authorities who
related it, as well as others contradictory to it; but we know
of no other transmission, whether it agrees or disagrees with
it, which is more reliable than that one, although there are
other reliable traditions also. For we are of the opinion that
'Umar uid not instruct men from the pulpit in the presence
of other companions of the Apostle save in what the Prophet
himself had instructed. So any other tradition related to us
by other companions which confirms this tradition is accepta­
ble to us.
257. He asked: What tradition?
258. [Shafi’i] replied: We are told by the trusted authority—
Yahya fa. Hassan—from al-Layth b. Su'd from Abu Zubayr al*
Makki from Sa'Id b. Jubayr and Tawus from Ibn 'Abbas, who
said:
T h e A postle instructed us how to recite -the tashahhud in the
same m a n n er as he taught us to recite the Q u r’an. H e said:
‘ Blessed greetings and good prayers to G od. O Prophet! Peace
an d G od’s mercies and blessings be upon you. Peace be upon us
and upon all good servants of God. I profess th at there is no
god at all but God and that M uham m ad is the Apostle o f G od.17

259. Shaft*! said: He asked: Why does the transmission [of
these traditions] from the Prophet vary? For Ibn Mas'ud, Abu
Musa and Jabir have related different versions, each varies
from the other in certain words, and [the Caliph] *Umar has
instructed men differently. Moreover, the tashahhud of ’A’isha
and Ibn 'Umar vary in wording; one of them includes a few
words additional to the other.
260. [Shafi'i] replied: The matter is quite clear.
261. He said: Explain it to me.
262. [Shafi'i] replied: The recitals glorifying God instructed
by the Apostle were committed to memory by men in words
varying from one person to another, from the time of [the
Prophet s] instruction. The main concern [of the transmitters]
was the change in meaning, not the words; but whenever the
change in wording resulted in a change of meaning such a
change was not permissible. For it is possible that the Prophet
himself permitted each man to recite what he had learned
provided that there was no change in the meaning of his
recital. So .the transmitters in turn regarded as permissible
the variations in the wording of the recitals but not in their
meaning.58
263. He asked: Is there any evidence making permissible
what you have described?
264. [Shafi'i] replied: Yesl
265. He asked: What is it?
266. [Shafi'i] replied: Malik [b. Anas] told us from Ibn
Shihab from 'Urwa [b. ahZubayr] from *Abd al-Rahman b.
al-Qari, who said: I have heard 'Umar b. al-Khattab say:
I have heard H isham b. H akim b. Hizam reciting the sura of the
F urqan [Q. XXV] differently from my recitation—which the
P rophet him self had instructed me how to recite—so I almost
quarrelled w ith him, b u t I w aited u n til he com pleted the recita­

tashahhud, see Shafi’i, Kitdb al'Umm, Vol. I. pp. 103-105.

dragged him to the Prophet, and I said: ‘ O Apostle of God! I
have heard this man recite the sura of the Furqan differently
from what you have instructed me.’ ‘ Recite it/ said the Prophet
to the man; and he recited it the way I had heard it from him.
'This is the way it was revealed [to me],' said the Apostle; and
he asked me to recite, which I did in the way he had instructed
me to recite it. ‘ This is the way it was revealed [to me]/ said
the Prophet and added: ‘ The Qur’an has been revealed in
accordance with seven modes59 and you may recite what is com
venient of it.’ 69
267. [Shafi'i] said: Since God, owing to His sympathy
toward man and His recognition of the weakness of his
memory, has permitted various recitals of His book in accord­
ance with seven modes—provided no change in the meaning
is made—variation in the wording of other books should be
all the more permissible as long as the meaning is not affected.
So changes in the wording of any text, save that of a divine
communication, is permissible if the meaning is not changed.
268. A Successor said: I have heard some of the Com­
panions [relating traditions from the Apostle] agreeing in
meaning but disagreeing in wording. I have taken up this
matter with one of them, who said: “ It is permissible unless
the meaning is changed.”
269. He asked: Since there is nothing in the recital of the
tashahhud but the glorification of God, changes in the wording
should be permissible, since, as you pointed out, [no change
is made in the meaning]. Similarly, as you said [an argument
might be advanced in favor of] fear-prayer, so that as long as
it was performed as fully as related from the Prophet, it
should fulfil the duty, since God lias distinguished between
that kind of prayer and others. But on what ground have
you made your choice of the tradition related by Ibn ’Abbas
on tashahhud to the exclusion of others?
MThis is an ambiguous expression in the Qur'an, the meaning of
which scholars have not agreed upon, " Modes ” seems to be the nearest
word to ahruf. See Tabari, Tafsir, Vol. I,?pp. 58-72; and Suyuti, al-Itqan

Contradictory Transmission of Traditions
Different From Other Kinds
271. [Shaft*! said]: Malik [b. Anas] told us from Nafi* from
Abu Sa'ld al-Khudr! that the Apostle said:
Let no one exchange gold for gold'save in equal quantities, or
increase one quantity against the other. Let no one exchange
silver for silver save in equal quantities, or increase one quantity
against the other. Let no one exchange anything at hand for
another not in evidence.61

Malik [b. Anas] told us trom Musa b. Abi Tamim from
Sa*Id b. Yasar from Abu Hurayra from the Apostle, who said:
The [gold] ,dinar [shall be exchanged] for a [gold] dinar and the

Malik [b. Anas] told us from fjumayd b. Qays from Mujahid

278. [Shaft*?] replied: Because Ibn ‘Abbas, who related it
differently, said:
There is no rib5 in a sale if the transfer of ownership takes place
immediately; but riba is in nasi‘a.*8

279. He asked: On what ground have you abandoned this
tradition, notwithstanding its contradiction of earlier ones?
280. [Shaft*?] replied: Although those who related tradi­
tions contradictory to Usama's were not as well-known experts
as he, they were in the meantime no less reliable than he.
However, ‘Uthman b. ‘Affan and *Ubada b. al-$amit were
earlier Companions and more intimately connected [with the
Prophet] than Usama. As to Abu Hurayra, he was regarded
as one of the senior Companions and the most reliable trans­
mitter of tradition in his time.
Since a tradition literally related by two authorities is likely
to be more accurate and reliable than one related by one only,
a tradition related by older and a greater number of authori­
ties (e. g„ five) should be the more acceptable than a tradition
related by one only.

Your [discretion] in our opinion, is contradictory to *A’isha's

to ‘A’isha's, it would be obligatory on both of us to accept
her tradition rather than another, for her tradition should

So whenever traditions are found to be contradictory, we

knowledge, or better memory; otherwise we choose the tradi­
tion related by two or more authorities in preference to one
related by one authority, or the one which is more consistent
with the general meaning of the Book or with the other sunnas
of the Apostle, or more acceptable to the scholars, or validated
by analogy, and [finally] the one followed by the majority of
the Apostle’s Companions.
288. He said: So we hold, as do all other scholars.
289. [Shafi'i] said: 'A’isha’s tradition is more consistent with
the Book of God [than others], for God says: " Be you watch­
ful over the prayers, and the middle prayer is included ” [Q.
II, 239]. So he who performs the prayer at the early time is
the one who performs it more in keeping [with the duty of
prayer].
Furthermore, the authorities who related ‘Aisha’s traditions
are all reputed to possess reliability and better memory. For
in addition to ‘A*isha there are three authorities who related
a similar tradition; they are: Zayd b. Thabit and Ibn Sa*d.Ta
It is likewise more consistent with the Prophet’s sunnas than
Raft* b. Khadij's tradition.
290. He asked: What sunnas?
291. [Shafi'i] replied: The Apostle of God said: “ T o pray
at the early time means that one receives God’s satisfaction;
to pray late [i. e., later than the proper time] means that one
must ask His pardon.” 74
He [the Prophet] does not prefer anything to God’s satis­
faction. As to pardon, it may either imply pardon for negli­
gence or for allowable [action]. Permission means that favor
will be given for the fulfilment of its opposite [i. e., prayer
at the early time], because there is no order to abandon the
opposite [action] which is permissible in the former.76
T*The third authority was perhaps left out by an error, for Shafi'i gives
the name as Anas b. Malik in his book, Ik h tila f al-H adith {K itd b al-U m m ,
Vol. VII, p. 207).
T«See Shafi'i, Ik h tila f al-H a d ilh (K itd b al-U m m , Vol. VII, p. 209).
Doubt has been raised on the authenticity of this tradition. See Shakir'*

292. He asked: What do you mean by that?
3237
295.
[Shafi‘1] replied: Since we are not permitted to aban­
don the performance of prayer at the scheduled time, only to
delay the time of its performance, it is therefore meritorious
to fulfil the duty at the scheduled time, although delay would
be regarded as negligence that can be exercised. For the
Apostle has made that clear in an answer to a question which
be was asked: **W hat is the most meritorious act? ” “ prayer
at the scheduled tim e/’ he replied.™ He [the Prophet] cer­
tainly will not abandon meritorious acts, nor will he order
men to do otherwise. No scholar is ignorant that the per­
formance of prayer at the scheduled time is most meritorious,
but men are apt to be busy, forgetful, and [may suffer from]
illnesses. That is the meaning which is more consistent with 3 288
the Book of God.
294. He asked: In what part of the Book?
295. [Shaft*?] replied: God said: *' Be you watchful over the
prayers, and the middle prayer is included ” [Q. II, 239]. So
he who performs the prayer at the scheduled time is more in
keeping [with his duty] than are those who.delay its per­
formance, We have noted that men prefer to perform their
obligatory and voluntary prayers as nearly on time as they can,
for they are liable to be busy or forgetful or suffer from other
illnesses [which may cause postponement]—these are matters
which are understandable. [Furthermore], the tradition re­
lated by Abu Bakr, *Umar, ‘Uthman, 'All b. Abi T^lib, Ibn
Mas‘ud, Abu Musa al-Ash'arl, Anas b. Malik and others con­
cerning the prompt performance of the dawn-prayer at the
scheduled time is a reliable tradition.
296. He asked: Was it by the prolongation of the recital
that Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman began their prayer in the
3289
half-light and completed it at day-break.
297. [Shafi'I] replied: They prolonged the recital [at one
time] and shortened it [at another]; but the performance at
the scheduled time is determined by when it begins/ not by

when it is completed. For they all began at half-light, and the
Prophet completed [his prayer] at half-light [while the others
completed theirs at day-break]. Thus you have disagreed with
a reliable tradition from the Apostle which it was binding on
you to accept; and you have disagreed with others by main­
taining that one may begin the performance of his prayer at
daybreak and complete it at daybreak, and that he can shorten
the recital. So,you have disagreed [with all the traditions] on
the time of the beginning of the prayer and on the shortening
of the recital as well as with the tradition that [the Prophet]
completed his prayer at half-light.
298. He asked: Would you regard Rafv's tradition as con­
tradictory to 'A’isha’s?
299. [Shaft*!] replied: No!
300. He asked: In what respect do they agree?
301. [Shafi'i] replied: Since the Apostle urged men to per­
form their prayer at the scheduled time and pointed out that
[such performance] was meritorious, his [attitude] implied that
he was in favor of performing the prayer at the end of day­
break. So he said: “ Pray at day break," by which he meant
just at the time the dawn begins.
302. He asked: Is there any other possible meaning?
303. [Shaft'!] replied: Yes. It may mean either what you
have held, or an intermediary position between your opinion
and mine, or any other meaning that may be implied by [the
term] daybreak.
304. He asked: What makes your opinion preferable to
mine?
305. [Shafi'i] replied; That which I have already explained
as well as the Prophet’s saying:
T h e re are two dawns: T h e first is like the tail of the sirhan [false

And Abu Ayyub said:
When we entered Syria we found water-closets already built

Tirst, since [the Arabs] were in the habit of going out into
the desert to ease nature* [the Prophet] ordered them neither
to face the qibla nor to turn their backs to it, since it was
easy to avoid facing the qibla and turning their backs to it
in the open desert. Since it so often happened that those who
went out to ease nature in the desert were seen uncovered by
men performing prayer, they were ordered to respect the qibla
of God by avoiding exposure of the uncovered portion of
their bodies to men performing prayer. This is the meaning
more consistent with [the Prophet’s] instructions. But God
knows bestl
Second, it is possible that [the Prophet] prohibited men
from going out to ease nature in the open desert in places
which were likely to be in the direction of the qibla in order
to protect it from filth which might hurt those who perform
prayer on it.
308. [Shaft'!] said: It is possible that Abu Ayyub heard the
tradition related from the Prophet in a general manner, so
he applied it both to the desert and the houses, making no
distinction between facing the qibla in the open desert and
in water-closets within houses in which those who ease nature
would be hidden. He [Abu Ayyub] seems to have related the
tradition in a general manner as he had heard it. It is indeed
the duty of all who may relate traditions in a general manner
to do so as they heard them until they find [qualifying] evi­
dence specifying them.
309. Shaft'! said: Because Ibn 'Umar related that he had
seen the Prophet easing nature while facing [the qibla of]
Jerusalem, one of the two qiblas—facing the latter qibla means
that he should turn his back to the Ka'ba—, he objected to
those who held that one should neither face the qibla nor
turn his back oh it while easing nature. He asserted that
nobody should prohibit an act which the Apostle himself had
permitted.
He [Ibn *Umar] did not seem to have heard the Apostle's
order concerning [easing nature in] the open desert in order
to draw a distinction between that act in the desert and in

sh X f iT ’ s

219

houses, so that he would relate the order of prohibition ap­
plicable to the desert and the order of permission applicable
to the houses. For [if he did] he would have cited the speci­
fication concerning the houses as he heard it and would have
distinguished between the two in the way the Apostle did,
owing to the differences in the conditions between houses and
the open desert.8*
This is an evidence that whoever heard an order from the
Apostle should obey it, even though [in obeying the order]
the difference between one specifying order and another was
unknown to him until such [an order] from the Apostle
became known to him.
There are several other parallel traditions, but we have
cited sufficient examples from among others we did not cite.

[Sufyan] b. ‘Uyayna told us fromal-Zuhrl from ‘UbaydAllah b. *Abd-Allah b. ‘Utba from Ibn ‘Abbas, who said:

asked about the sudden attack at night on unbelievers in an

311. [Shaft*!] said: Sufyan held that the Prophet's saying;
" They [women and children] are included," meant that their
killing was permissible, but that [such a permission] was abro­
gated by his order relating to Ibn Abl al-IJuqayq; and [Sufyan]
added that whenever al-Zuhri related the tradition of al-$a'h
b. Jaththama, he added to it the tradition of Ibn Ka'b [pro- S298
hibiting the killing of women and children].
312 .Shaft*! said: The tradition of al-Sa'b b. Jaththama
dates from the time of the Prophet’s ‘umra [or lesser pil­
grimage].8* So if it were related from the time of the first
*umra, his order [of killing] Ibn Abi al-IJuqayq was either
given before this *umra, according to one opinion, or in the
same year, to another; but if],the tradition were related at the
second ‘umra, "its date must be after the Prophet had given B42
the order to [kill] Ibn Abl al-Huqayq. But God knows best!
But we know of no order ever given [by the Prophet] per­
mitting the killing of women and children which he later
repealed. The reason for [the Prophet’s] order prohibiting
the killing of women and children, in our opinion, was to
specify their exclusion from the order of killing whenever
they could be distinguished from others [not because the
killing of women and children was then permitted]. As to
[the Prophet’s] saying: "T hey [women and children] are in­
cluded,” the order means that [women and children] were
subject to two rules: First, that they were immune neither
by the faith [of Islam] which prohibits the shedding of blood S299
of believers only, nor, [secondly,] by the rule governing only
the territory [of Islam] which prohibits sudden attack on that
territory.
Since the Prophet permitted sudden attack by night on
enemy territory, on the strength of his order to attack the
Guillaume’s translation, pp. 482-83. See also Abu Dawud, Vol. I ll, p. 54
.(the latter part of the tradition).
** The Prophet twice performed the ‘umra (lesser pilgrimage): the
first was in the year 7 of the hijra (A. D. 629), before the capture of
Makka, and the second in the year 8 of the hijra (A. D. 630), shortly
after the capture of Makka. See Ibn Hisham, Vol. II, pp. 788-89, 886-87;
Guillaume’s translation, pp. 530-31.

#anu al-Mu$taliq, [legal] knowledge prescribes that sudden
attack by night, with the [consequential] killing of women
and children, is lawful by an order of the Prophet, and that
whoever kills them shall be subject neither to punishment
jjor to atonement [kaffara], nor to blood-money, [diya], nor
to retaliation. Thus, if sudden attack by night is permitted
the protection of Islam cannot save them. But whoever kills
women and children should not do so intentionally, if they
are recognizable and distinguishable.87 He [the Prophet] pro­
hibited the killing Of children, because they do not compre­
hend disbelief sufficiently to be able to practice it, and the
women, because they do not fight. They and the children
might be taken as khawls (i.-e., wives, slaves and servants)
who will reinforce the followers of God’s religion.
313. Someone said: Explain that by citing other examples?
314. [Shafi’I] replied: Enough has been given to the learned
in distinction from others.
315. He asked: Will you give further evidence by citing
a relevant text from the Book of God?
316. [Shafi'i] replied : 88 God said:
It is n ot for a believer to kill a believer, unless it be by mistake.
If anyone kills a believer by mistake, [the penalty is] the setting
free of a believing slave, and blood-money is to be paid to his
family, unless they forgo it as a free-will offering. If he [i. e. th e
victim] belongs to a people at enm ity w ith you an d is a believer,
the com pensation should be the setting free of a believing slave.
If he belongs to a peopler between whom and you there is a com­
pact, blood-money is to be paid to his family an d the killer shall
set free a believing slave. H e who does not find the m eans to
do that, shall fast two consecutive m onths—a repentance from
God; verily G od is All-knowing, All-wise [Q. IV. 94].88

So 80 God has imposed the penalty of paying the diya [blood• ,1For further discussion on this rule, see Shafi’I, Kitab al-Umm, Vol.
IV, pp. 156-57.
** In the text: “ Shafi'I replied: Yes, God said/’
But “ if anyone kills a~ believer intentionally, his recompense is hell,
to abide therein. God will be angry with him and will curse him, and
prepare for him a mighty punishment ” [Q. IV, 95].

money] and the freeing of a slave for the killing of a believer
by mistake; and the payment of the diya and the freeing of a
believing slave for the killing of a member [of a people] with
whom Islam had made a compact. So in both cases killing is
prohibited either by religion, or by compact, and by (residence
in] the territory [of Islam]. If the believer kills another
believer in a non-Muslim territory—wherein killing is not
prohibited—faith prohibits him from so doing; he is there­
fore under [an obligation of] the kaffara (atonement), but not
the [payment of the] diya, for the shedding of the believer's
blood is prohibited by the faith. Since the killing of nonMuslim children and women is neither prohibited by religion
nor by residence in Muslim territory, compensation to the
near of kin, retaliation, blood-money, and atonement are not
obligatory.

two possible meanings: [First,] the literal, is that cleanliness

time? ’ ‘Umar asked. ' O Commander of the believers! I was at
the market-place when I heard the call to prayer, so I performed

the Companion who entered the mosque without washing as
‘Uthman b. ‘Affan.

[Shafi‘1] said: Since ‘Umar knew well that the Apostle
had ordered [complete] washing [on Fridays], and knew that
'Uthman was well aware of the Apostle’s order and reminded
him of it, and ‘Uthman admitted that he knew it, therefore
if anyone thought that ‘Uthman might have forgotten, he
should remember that ‘Umar would have reminded him
before he performed the prayer; and since ‘Uthman neither
desisted from performing the prayer until he had washed nor
was ordered by ‘Umar to wash, this indicates that both must $ 3 0 4
have been certain that the Apostle's order for the [Friday]
washing was optional-hot obligatory—, since neither ‘Umar
nor ‘Uthman would have neglected the order of washing
unless, as I have already explained, it was regarded as optional.

that no one should propose marriage to a woman in com­
petition with his brother, the literal meaning of the tradition
would have been that it was unlawful for any one to propose
marriage to a woman in competition with another from the
time when the suit was begun to the time of .its withdrawal.
324. [Shafi’i] said: The Prophet’s saying: “ Let none of you
propose, etc. . . .
may have been an answer to a specific
question, but the one who related the tradition did not know
the reason for which the Apostle had given the answer. So
either a certain portion, not all, of the tradition was related,
or the portion which was subject to doubt was [consciously]
not related. Thus it is possible that the Prophet was asked a
question about a man who sought to marry a certain woman,
and she agreed to marry him, but when another, whom she
preferred to the first, sought to marry her, she rejected the
first in favor of the second. So [the Prophet] prohibited the
proposal to this woman. For if the woman rejected [the
second man] after she had accepted him, the first to whom
she wanted to return might not agree to marry her. The conr
sequences would be disadvantageous to both, [for it would,
be more difficult for them to find a partner to marry].
325. Someone may ask: Why do you maintain that the;
Prophet’s order prohibiting one man to propose marriage in
competition with another specified the meaning [in a certain
situation], to the exclusion of others?
326. [Shafi’i replied]: Because there is a specific indication
[in the tradition] to this effect.

Salma b. ‘Abd al-Rahman from Fatima, daughter of Qays, who
said: Her husband had divorced her and the Apostle ordered
her to fulfil the 'idda [waiting period] in the house of Ibn
Umm Maktum before she could lawfully remarry, and told
her to let him know when she had become lawful [for re­
marriage]. When the time had come, she told him that

Fapma—after she had told him that Mu‘awiya> and Abu Jahm
had proposed to her—specified two points:
First, the Prophet knew well that the proposals of the two
men [Abu Jahm and Mu'awiya] had not been made [at the
same time, but] one after the other. Since he did not tell her
that one of them had no right to propose until the other had
withdrawn, and since he [himself] proposed to her on behalf
of Usama—after she had been proposed to—we concluded that
she must have rejected the earlier proposals, for [the Prophet]
would have ordered her to marry the one she had accepted.
So her intimation [to the Prophet] that two [men] had pro­
posed to her was merely to inform him that she already had
rejected them. She may have told him because she wanted
his advice, for if she had accepted either one, she would not
have sought his advice.
[Second], since the Prophet proposed to her on Usama’s
behalf, we concluded that the circumstances in which he pro­
posed to her were different from those which he regarded as
unlawful. Nor does the circumstance [in which the Prophet
proposed to her] distinguishing this proposal from the otherrendering the one lawful and the other unlawful—make the mar­
riage valid unless she empowered her guardian [the Prophet]
to arrange her marriage on her behalf. If the guardian [for­
mally] arranges the marriage, [the contract] becomes [equally]
binding on both, and she becomes lawful [only] to him. Other­
wise, neither does the guardian have the right to arrange the

man-iage without her permission, nor does her approval or
disapproval [of the proposition] make any difference.
330. Someone may ask: [Do you not think that] the circum­
stances of her approval are different from those of her
disapproval?
331. [Shafi‘1 replied]: [Yes, they are] for if a man proposes to a woman and she rejects him with an affront, and sheneither rejects him with an affront nor. approves when he
proposes again, her attitude is different and may be regarded
as nearer to acceptance. Thus the circumstances in which
she rejected him with an affront were different from those in
which she did not reject him with an affront, for in the latter
case her attitude was nearer to acceptance. Thus her attitude
changed from non-commital to another nearer to approval
than to non-approval.
No meaning other than the one which I have [just] de­
scribed is valid: [The Prophet] has prohibited a proposal of
marriage to a woman who had already been committed by
her guardian, with her approval, to another; and that unless
the guardian’s commitment had been made, her previous posi­
tion had not changed. But God knows best.101

Orders of Prohibition [in Some
Traditions] More Clearly Stated
Than in Previous [Traditions]
332.
[Shafi‘1 said]: Malik [b. Anas] told us from Naff* from
Ibn ‘Umar that the Apostle said:
The two parties to a sale [contract] have the-right of option [to
cancel the contract] so long as they have not separated, except
101 ShafiTs controversy over this question was with Malikl followers,
since Malik maintained that the Prophet’s order of prohibition was con­
fined only to the woman who had given prior approval to a person, speci­
fied the dowry and agreed to marry him. See Malik, Vol. II, pp. $23-24.

the sale of option (bay* al-Khiyar) [i. e., that the right of option
would be as stipulated in the contract].10*
Sufyan [b. *Uyayna] told us from al-Zuhrl from Sa'Id b
al-Musayyib from Abu Hurayra that the Apostle said:
Let no one sell to someone else what he already has agreed to
q sell to another.103
The meaning implied in this [communication] indicates
that the Apostle decreed that '* the two parties to a sale have
the right of option so long as they have not parted/’ and his
order of prohibition concerning sale by one person in contra­
vention of his agreement to sell to another means that [such
an order is applicable] only so long as the two [parties] have
not departed from the place of the transaction. For the two
cannot be regarded as two parties to the sale until they have
made the contract. Once the contract is made, it becomes
binding on the parties, and no disadvantage befalls the vendor
if another man enters into another sale; transaction with the
purchaser whether relating to the same property or to dif­
ferent property after the property is sold. But so long as the
two parties have the right of option and another vendor may
offer, let us say, a suit of cloth for nine dinars while the other
had asked ten, the purchaser is bound to cancel the sale trans­
action since he has the right of option before they separate.
He may even cancel the first sale transaction and make no
other one. So the other [vendor's] action could be disadvan­
tageous to either the first vendor and the purchaser, or to
either one of them. This is the explanation for the [Prophet’s]
order of prohibition that no man should enter into a sale
transaction in contravention of his agreement to sell to another,
and I know of no other. For do you not agree that if a roan
purchases a suit of cloth for ten dinar: and the sale contract
is binding on the two parties before they separate, no damage
accrues to the first vendor if a second vendor offers to sell the

prospective purchaser one dinar cheaper, because the sale con­
tract for ten dinars had become binding and could not be
cancelled.

333. [Shafi‘1] said: It has been related from the Prophet
that he said:
L et none of you bargain in com petition w ith his b ro th er [i. e.»
an o th er M uslim].

If this tradition were reliable, although I do not consider
it to be so, it would be parallel to the one which runs as
follows:
L et none of you propose m arriage to a w om an in com petition
w ith his b rother.

“ No one should bargain in competition with his brother ”
means that [no sale to another is permitted] if he [the vendor]
has indicated an intent to sell before the sale takes place, so
that if the contract is made it becomes binding.
334. If someone should ask: What is the evidence for that?
335. He would be told: The Apostle sold [a piece of property
to a person] who paid a higher price. The sale of a property
to one who paid a higher price is a bargain against another's
bargain; but the vendor [in this case] did not accept the offer
of the first person and demanded a higher price.104

337. [Shaft*!] said: Similarly, other traditionsTrom the Apos­
tle should be accepted as explicitly general unless an indica­
tion specifies otherwise, as 1 have explained, or unless there is
an agreement of the Muslim [scholars].- specifying that their
meaning is implicit, not explicit [literal], and that it is par­

and he who performs one cycle of the ‘asr prayer before sun-set
would be regarded as having performed his prayers at for­
bidden times, because both would be regarded as having been
performed after the morning and *asr prayers, coinciding with
sun-rise and the sun-set, and these are times at which the
performance of prayers is prohibited.
Since the Apostle considered those who perform their prayers
at these times as having performed the morning and 'a$r
prayers, we concluded that his order of prohibition against
performing prayer at these times governs supererogatory prayers
[only], which are not obligatory, for he would not permit the
performance of a prescribed prayer at a time forbidden for
such prayers.
Malik [b. Anas] told us from Xbn Shihab from Ibn alMusayyib that the Apostle said:
W hoever forgot to perform a certain prayer should make up f0r
it w henever he rem em bered it, for G od said: ' A nd perform the
prayer for my rem em brance ‘ [Q. X X , H ].159

Malik [b. Anas] and ‘Imran b. al-Idusayn related a tradition
from the Prophet similar to that of Ibn al-Musayyib, but one
of them added: ” [Whoever forgot . . .] or was asleep . .
Shafi‘1 said: In his saying that ", . . he should make up for
it whenever he remembered it,” the Apostle, on God's behalf,
appointed no specific time for it, but stated that it should be
performed as soon as it was remembered.

*Abd aI*MajId [b. ‘Abd al-'AzIz] told us from Ibn Jurayj
from ‘Afa’ [b. Yasar] from the Prophet, a similar tradition,
adding at the beginning: *'Men o f‘Abd al-Mutfalib, etc. . . ,11#
339. [Shafi'T] said: So Jubayr informed [us] that the Prophet
gave an order permitting the performance of the circumam­
bulation and prayer at any time that anyone wished to do so.
This [order] clearly indicates that the [Prophet’s] orders pro­
hibiting the performance of prayers at certain times related
only to optional prayers, not to obligatory prayers. For Mus­
lims performed the funeral prayers, which were obligatory,
generally after the morning and the *a$r prayers [irrespective
of the forbidden times].
Some of our followers argued that since ‘Umar b. al-Khattab
performed the circumambulation after daybreak and, finding
the sun had not yet risen, went to Tuwa 1X4 and couched his
camel and performed the prayer after sunrise, they prohibited
the performance of the circumambulation prayer after both
the ‘a$r and the morning prayers just as they prohibited
optional prayers.115
340. [Shaft*!] said: If ‘Umar delayed the circumambulation
prayer, he delayed it because it was permissible for him to do
so. For he may have been in need of a certain place at Tuwa
to ease nature ,118 and it was permissible for him [to delay the
prayer]. However, [‘Umar] had heard only the general order
of prohibition, and he punished al-Munkadir [b. ‘Abd-Allahj
by striking him for performing a prayer after the *a$r in
Madina, without realizing that the order of prohibition was
specified to the situation that I have just explained and so

of permission was different from that of prohibition, just as
I have already explained in the [case of the tradition of] *All

because ‘All had heard the Prophet's [general] order but did
not hear the reasons for that [particular] prohibition.

the answer to other [questions].

contrary to what the two have done?

Shafi‘1 said: The exchange o£ [fresh] dates for dry dates
was prohibited on the strength of the Prophet’s order of pro­
hibition, and the Prophet made it clear that he prohibited
[such an exchange] because fresh dates lose weight after they
dry. He [the Prophet] prohibited the exchange of dates for
dates except in equal quantities, because he noted the loss of
weight when fresh dates become dry, so that the exchange
cannot possibly be equal in quantities since the [amount]
lost cannot be known. Thus the [Prophet’s] order of pro­
hibition includes two meanings: The differential in weight,
and al-muzabana; the latter means the sale of a known for an
unknown [i. e., shrinking] measure of the same kind.
Since the Apostle permitted the exchange of ‘ariyas for dry
dates by measure, his special permission [of sale] should not
be construed as permission for other kinds of sale, such as
al-muzabana or the exchange of [dry] dates for fresh dates, for
his order of prohibition is general excluding only [the sale of]
‘arlyas. This is an example of the general speech intended to
mean the particular.123

[SufyanJ b. 'Uyayna told us from Xbn Abi Najlh from *AbdAllah b. Kathir from Abu al-Minhal from lbn 'Abbas, who
said:

When the Apostle of God entered Madina, he found men in the
habit of paying for dates in advance for one or two years. There­
upon he stipulated: ‘ Whoever pays in advance [for a commodity],
he shall do so for a specified measure and a definite weight, to
be delivered at a fixed time.128

349. [ShafW] said: The Prophet’s order of prohibition
against the vendor’s sale [of a commodity] not in his own
possession means either that the vendor may sell the com­
modity before it is seen by the buyer as it had been seen by
the vendor at the time of sale, or that the vendor may sell a
commodity he either did not have or had not taken possession
of, so that the vendor was not responsible for it nor was it in
his possession to be able to hand it over to the buyer. [Finally]
the Prophet’s order may have another meaning, other than
the two [mentioned].
Since the Apostle stipulated that “ whoever pays in advance
[for a commodity] should do so for a specified measure and
a definite weight, to be delivered at a fixed time,” such [kind
of a commodity] falls in the category of sale in which the
commodity is neither in the vendor’s possession nor ready for
delivery at the time of sale. But since the vendor is responsible
[for such a commodity] at the time of delivery, the Prophet’s

order indicates that he prohibited only the kind of sale in

The [Prophet’s] order of prohibition may have been in­

for it would be liable‘to destruction o r 1shrinkage before it

[Shafi'I] said: Thus every explicitly general statement

another reliable tradition from the Apostle indicates-that only
part of that explicitly general statement was intended to be
general, as' I have already explained regarding this and other
similar points. It is obligatory on the scholars to accept the
two kinds of traditions as complimentary—not as contradictory— s^
in so far as they can be regarded as complimentary, for if .there
is a way for harmonizing them, without regarding either one
more binding, than the other, [they should'do so]. No two
traditions should ever be regarded as contradictory so long as
there is a possibility of harmonizing them; a contradictory
tradition is one which is incapable of being harmonized except b<s
by abandoning another, such as when two traditions relate
to one [specific] act, the one permitting it and the other pro- SJ4J
hibiting it.

Chapter X

[ON SINGLE-INDIVIDUAL
TRADITIONS] 1
351.
Someone has'asked me: Will 5you state what ;the
minimum proof for a narrative related by a few [transmitters]
should be in order to be binding upon scholars?
352.
[Shafi‘1] replied: [The minimum proof] is th a t;the
narrative must be related .by one person from another [before
him] back to the Prophet, or to one next to the Prophet.2 The S369
proof for such a tradition is not established unless certain
conditions are fulfilled:
He who relates a tradition must merit confidence m his
religion, and be known as reliable in his transmitting, comprehending what he transmits, aware of any pronunciation that
might change the meaning of the tradition, capable of trans­
mitting the tradition word for word as he heard it, not merely
transmitting [in his own words] its'meaning; for if he trans­ S370
mits only the meaning and is unaware of what might alter
its sense, he might unknowingly transmute the -lawful into
the unlawful and vice-versa.3 So if he transmits word for word
there remains no ground for fearing a change of the meaning.
[Furthermore], he should have learned the tradition by heart,

i£ he relates it from memory, and should have memorized the
written text [of traditions] if he relates it in its written form;
when he participates with others in relating a tradition from
memory, that which they relate must agree. He must not be
an interpolator,4 attributing to someone whom he has not met
that which he has not heard from him, or attributing to the
Prophet something different from that which reliable authori­
ties relate from him,
The same [qualifications] must be possessed by transmitters
preceding him until the transmitter relates back to the Prophet
or to him who carries it back closest to him, for each of them
vouches for the tradition as he received it and verifies it for
him to whom he passes it. So none of them should lack [the
qualifications] I have just described.
353. He asked: Explain this to me fay an example con­
cerning which I am better informed, owing to my knowledge
of it and my limited knowledge of what you have described in
the traditions.
354. [Shafi'i] replied: Would you like me to cite an example
for which this "might be an analogy?
355. He said: Yes.
356. [Shafi'1] said: [Traditions] constitute a source in them­
selves and should not be regarded as analogous to anything
else, for analogy is weaker than the .original source.
357. He asked: I do not mean that you should consider it
as an analogy. Will you give me an example of it from testi­
monies which are generally known?
358. [Shafi'i] replied: Testimonies may disagree in certain
matters and agree in others.
359. He asked: In. what [matters] could they disagree?
360. [Shafi'i] replied: I accept a tradition from either one

man or one woman,5 but I will accept neither one alone in
testimony. I accept the traditions [in the form]: “ So-and-so
related to me from so-and-so ” if the transmitter is not an
interpolater; but I do not accept it in testimony unless [the
witness] says: “ I heard [so-and-so] ” or “ I saw [so-and-so] "
or “ take me as a witness/’
Traditions, however, vary; I accept some of them by istidlal
(inductive reasoning) on the basis of the Book [of God], the
sunna, consensus, and analogy, but istidlal is not applicable
to testimony as well. There are many people whose testimony
is acceptable, but I do not accept a tradition related by them
owing to the possibility that it might contain many changes
in meaning and might omit certain words affecting the meaning.
But [traditions] may agree with testimony on matters other S373
than those I have already described.
361. He asked: I agree with what you have said concerning
your refusal to accept a tradition from anyone except a trust­
worthy authority who had learned it by heart and is aware of
what might change the meaning of the tradition. But why do
you not accept such conditions in the case of testimony?
362. [ShafH] replied: Changes in the meaning of traditions
are more difficult to detect than in the case of testimony. So
I am much more careful in the case of a tradition than in
the case of testimony.
363. He said: I agree with you; but if the person from
whbm someone quotes a tradition is reliable and he [in turn]
transmits from a man whose reliability you do not know, then
I do not accept your refusal to put confidence in his good $374
reputation and your insistence that he must narrate only from
a reliable source even though you may not know who it is.
364. [ShafiTj replied: If four persons of just character, wellversed in the law, testified confirming the testimony of two
witnesses in favor of the claim of one man against another,f
would you take a decision if the four persons did not tell you
that the two witnesses were of just character?

character, either on the basis*of the confirmation fby the four
persons of their just character, or :of\the ;confirmation*of their
just character by,«others;*or ion thenbasis of my owmknowledge
of their just character.
*
366. [Shaft1!] said: Why would you mot ■accept their\[testb>
mony] for 1the,same reason/that you; wanted me to accept’the
tradition, and say* that'they would not have, testified in favor
of anyone unless they ,considered him to be of just character?
367. He said: They might testify both in favor of someone
whom they considered to be of just character, and in:favor of
someone whom they knew, although they did not know his
just character. Since such a -possibility* might exist' in their
testimony, I could not accept the testimony of those who
testified in his favor until [either] they, declared him of just
character or I was certain of his just character and the just
character of those <who testified before me concerning the just
character of others. Nor do I accept the confirmation of the
just character.of’a witness unless I know the just character
of the person who confirms the just character of the witness.
368. [Shafi'i] said: The proof that you have adduced in this
matter is against you^because you do not accept the narrative
of a truthful .[person] from someone whose truthfulness we do
not know. People are more careful to testify only on behalf
of the .testimony of someone whose just character they know
than they are in accepting a. tradition only from someone^
whose transmission of traditions is known to be sound. -This
is because one man may meet another in whom'he sees the
mark of goodness* and thinks'well of him,, so that he accepts
the tradition from.him and passes it* on without knowing his
character. >Thus he may relate that a man called so-and-so
transmitted,to; him such-and-such [a-tradition] and hopes-that
he might find a trustworthy man who would know of the
tradition so that he could accept it from him, or that he could
relate it on the authority, of a, transmitter whether he approves
of it or not; or he might be careless in transmitting the tradi­
tion from him. For I do not know that I have ever met any-

r* 4

, s h a f i ‘I ’s R t s a l a

one who did not relate [traditions] both from; a trustworthy
authority who had-learned them-by-*heart and from' other
sources who were quite different. ?In such cases.:I have done'
what was incumbent upon me. jNor was my search for. knowing
the veracity of him who related a tradition to me more»of an
obligation- tJian my quest, for knowledge of therveracity of
those from whom he had, received the tradition. For. as far as
all of them are concerned I know,all I need [to know] about
those from whom I receive: a tradition,- since all of them con­
firmed the narrative as received from those before them and
handed it on to those after them.
369. He asked: What about [the possibility of]-accepting a
tradition from a person whom you have never known to be
an interpolator, relating it from so-and-so, although it might
be possible that he had never heard.it? ,
370. [Shaft*!] replied: Muslims of just character•are right
[when they testify] about themselves, but their status ivis-^-visj
themselves is different from their status vis-^-vis others. Dot
you not agree that if I knew them to be of just character [in
matters] concerning themselves, VI should accept their -testi­
mony; but that when they confirm, the testimony of another
witness I cannot accept that testimony until I- know the just,
character of the other witness., For.my knowledge of their just
character does not constitute ^knowledge of the just character
of him* whose, testimony they-confirmed: We should accept
the information they relate about themselves, and assume that
their statements are valid until their deeds indicate the oppo­
site. We^ should then be on our guard, in .the matter with
regard to which their ^eeds did not, conform to what they,
ought to have done.

related from so-and-so
they only narrate what they have
heard from others whom they have met from those whom we
know who [operate in] this fashion. We accept the form:
“ So-and-so related to me from so-and-so,” - if he is not an
interpolater.®
He whom we have known to interpolate on one occasion
has exposed to us his fault in his transmission. This fault
constitutes neither falsehood, which would cause us to reject
his tradition, nor a real truth. Hence we accept from him
that which we accept from those who speak the real truth.
So [our position is] that we do not accept a tradition from
an interpolater unless he says in it: “ He related to me ” or
“ I heard.”
371. He said: I see that you accept the testimony [of a man]
whose tradition you do not accept.
372. [Shaft'I] replied: This is because of the greater signifi­
cance and position of traditions among the Muslims as well as
for another obvious reason.
373. He asked: What is it?
374. [Shaft*!] replied: A word might be omitted from the
tradition and thus alter its meaning; or a word might be pro­
nounced differently from the way it was pronounced by the
transmitter, thus altering the meaning of the tradition, even
though he yvho pronounced it did not intend to do so. If he
who transmits a tradition is ignorant of its meaning, he does
not understand the tradition, and we do not accept it. [For]
if he transmits what he does not understand, he is of those
who do not transmit the tradition word for word; and he seeks
to transmit the meaning of the tradition, but he does not SJ80
understand the meaning at all.
375. He asked: Is it possible that ihe tradition of a man of
just character might not be acceptable?
376. [Shaft*!] replied: Yes, for if he w^re [the type of person]
I have just described, this would give rise to open suspicion
that would cause his tradition to be rejected. A man might
be just in testifying for other men, but suspect when he testi*

)r

lies for himself or for some of his relatives. For it is [perhaps]
easier for a man to let himself fall from a height than to give
a false testimony. However, whenever he becomes subject to
suspicion his testimony is rejected for that reason. For distrust
of those who do not transmit a tradition word for word and
who do not understand its meaning is most clearly [indicated]
in the case of those who testify in favor of someone whose
testimony has been rejected because of dubious [elements]
that it contains.
The testimony of witnesses should be [carefully] considered;
if we detect a certain bias or an excessive interest in the person
on whose behalf they are testifying, we do not accept their S38I
testimony. If they testify regarding a difficult matter beyond
their ability to comprehend, we do not accept their testimony,
for we do not believe that they understand the meaning of
that to which they have testified. We do not accept the testi­
mony of those whose transmission betrays many errors and
which has no sound written source, just as we do not accept
witnesses who make many errors in their testimony.
377.
Shaft*! said: 7 Traditionists vary: Some are well known
[for their knowledge] of tradition; they make every effort in
their search for it, listening to their fathers, uncles, near of
kin, and friends as well as spending long hours in the com­
pany of scholars and disputants in the field. Such people stand s 332
in the forefront of [the science of] tradition .8 If [their trans­
mission] is contradicted by someone who is less knowledgeable,
it is better to accept the tradition of the former.
W ith regard to the traditionists, if they are jointly [engaged
in considering] a tradition handed down by a certain man,
they try to find out whether it agrees with what has been
memorized by one of them and whether it is supported by
those who have committed [the traditions] to memory, or
whether it conflicts with what he and those who have memo­
rized the traditions have learned by heart. If the transmitted
[versions] differ, we seek guidance from [the versions that

people] have memorized. One can then tell from the errors
and other indications therein what the truth is. We have
explained about memorization and errors in another section
[of this work], I ask God to protect us against error and grant
us success.9
378. He asked: On what ground do you accept a tradition
related by a single individual even though you do not accept
the [unsupported] testimony of one witness? What is your
argument for holding that the single-individual tradition and a3o
testimony are ambiguous in most cases but different in others?
379. [Shafi'I] replied: You are repeating a question that I
thought I had already answered: I do not compare [the single­
individual tradition] with testimony. You asked me to give a
parallel example more familiar to you than traditions. I gave
you such an example, but I did not mean that analogical
deduction is applicable to tradition. For the proof of a single­
individual tradition is too strong to need the support of a
parallel example; indeed it is an original source in itself.
380. He asked: How is it that traditions are like testimony
in certain respects but not in others?
381. [Shaft'!] replied: [Traditions] are different from testi­
mony in some respects, as 1 have already pointed out to you;
but if I have said that they are similar to testimony in some
respects and not others, I have done so for certain obvious asw
reasons.
382. He asked: What are they, since the purpose of all
testimony is the same?
383. [Shafi'I] replied: Do you mean in all cases or only in
certain ones?
384. He said: In all cases.
385. [Shafi'I] asked: What is the minimum number [of wit­
nesses] you would require in [a case of] adultery?
386. He replied: Four.
387. [Shafi'I] asked: If there are only three of them, would
you order [the accusers] to be scourged?
388. He replied: Yes.

389. [Shaft*!] asked: How many witnesses would you require
in [the case of] murder, disbelief [i. e., apostasy], and highway
robbery, all of which are punishable by death?
390. He replied: Two.
391. [Shaft*!] asked: How many witnesses would you require 8385
in [cases of theft of] property?
392. He replied: One male and two female witnesses.
393., [Shaft*!] asked: How many witnesses would you require
in [cases relating to] vices affecting women?
394. He replied: One woman.
395. [Shaft*!] asked: If there were lacking [either one] of
the two witnesses or one of the male and two female witnesses,
would you not order the [remaining] witnesses to be scourged
as you did in [the case of] adultery?
396. He replied: No.10
8 53
397. [Shaft*!] asked: Do you consider that all these cases are
similar?
398. He replied: Yes, I agree that the number [of witnesses]
required is not the same and that only the witnesses in the »
case of adultery should be scourged.
399. [Shaft*!] asked: If I were to tell you that the same
applies to the single-individual tradition, namely that I accept
it as I do in testimony but that it is different with regard to
the number [of witnesses], would that [not] constitute a strong 8388
argument against you?
400. He replied: I have held my opinion concerning the
variation in the [minimum] number of witnesses required in
testimony on the strength of narrative and inductive reasoning.
401. [Shaft*!] said: Likewise, what I have held concerning
the acceptance of the single-individual tradition is based on
narrative and reasoning.
402. [Shaft*!] said: Do you maintain that if you did not
accept the testimony of women in [a case concerning] child­
birth that you would not accept it in [a case involving] property?
10“ Yes" in the Arabic text (implying approval that the remaining
witnesses should not be scourged).

248

403. He replied: [I should act] according to precedent [i. e.,
the practice followed by Muslims].
404. [Shaft*!] said: What would you do if someone told you
that the Qur'an does not stipulate [that there can be] less than
one male and two female [witnesses]?
405. He replied: Nothing is stipulated against accepting
less than that [number], so we have accepted what the Muslims
have permitted, which is not contrary to the Qur’an.
406. [Shaft*!] said: We have held the same opinion con­
cerning the confirmation of the single-individual tradition,
based on reasons all of which are stronger than that per­
mitting the testimony of women.
407. He asked: Is there anything other than precedent that
could justify a distinction between tradition and testimony?
408. [Shaft*!] replied: Yes, and I know of no scholar who
does not accept it.
409. He asked: What is it?
410. [Shaft*!] replied: It is [the witness of] just character,
whose testimony is acceptable in certain circumstances and
unacceptable in others.
411. He asked: In what circumstances is his testimony
unacceptable?
412. [Shaft*!] replied: [The circumstances are] when he
testifies in cases in which his personal interests are principally
involved, as when he defends himself against a certain debt,
when he testifies in cases involving his son or his father or
when he uses the testimony to defend them, and [finally] in
any other circumstance liable to arouse suspicion.
Furthermore, in a matter of testimony, [if] a witness testi­
fies that a certain person is liable for a debt or a punishment,
or if he testifies that a debt should be paid to a man or a
punishment be inflicted on his behalf, he [the witness] is not
responsible for any debt which is not concerned with his
[the accuser’s] debt, nor fot the dishonor which befalls him.
However, the witness might become more partial if his son
or father were involved. But Iris testimony would be accepted
[in the cases stated above], because there is no obvious sus-

Sh a f i T s R i s a l a

249

pidon such as there would be in the case involving himself,
his son, and his father or any other situations which might
give ground for suspicion.
But the one who related traditions concerning what is lawful
or unlawful is not obtaining any material advantage for him­
self or for others nor is he defending himself or anyone else,
nor is he dealing with anything that involves punishment
[meted out] against anybody or on behalf of anybody. There­
fore, he and the Muslims from whom he related the tradition
are on equal footing, whether [the tradition] concerns lawful
or unlawful acts. He is like anyone else and his status is not
different in this respect; on one occasion he might be sus­
pected and his narrative rejected; on another occasion he
might be free of suspicion and his narrative accepted, just as
the status of any witness may differ whether he is an ordinary
or notable Muslim,
There are circumstances in which people relate informa­
tion more accurately and there are [cases] in which they are
more pious than others. When people are in fear during ill­
ness or travel, or are mindful [of death] under such conditions
or similar ones making them alive to [the danger of] negli­
gence, they strive to be more careful; they concentrate their
thoughts more effectively and are less forgetful. In such con­
ditions 11 the untruthful Muslim might become truthful and
his information trustworthy. His narrative might be regarded
as reliable and fully trustworthy, if not because he is pious
at least because he is afraid that he might cause people to
distrust a tradition that he is not trying to use to defend him­
self or exploit to his own advantage. Subsequently, however,
he might revert to prevarication or cause people to have reser­
vations about believing everything he has said.
Since there are certain circumstances in which the public
and the untruthful might be truthful to the satisfaction of
transmitters of traditions, it is more appropriate that pious
and truthful men should in all circumstances be more careful
than others; for they are in a position of [public] trust and
11 “ Shafi'I said ” is omitted.

they are held up as examples for the faith and they are aware
of the obligation imposed on them by God to be truthful in
all matters and that the traditions dealing with that which is
lawful and unlawful are of the highest importance and hence
above all should be beyond suspicion. Moreover, a tradition
from the Apostle has given them a meaning that has never
been given with regard to anyone else—namely, that the fate
of him who attributes a falsehood to the Apostle shall be
hell-fire.

claims that he is the son of someone other than his own father.18

| asked Abu Qatada: How is it that you do not relate [traditions]
from the Apostle as other men do? ' I heard the Apostle say:
He who tells a lie about me is surely seeking for himself,a resting

Sufyan [b. TJyayna] related from Muhammad b. ‘Amr [b.
♦Alqama] from Abu Salama [b. *Abd al-Rahraan] from Abu
Hurayra, that the Apostle said:
You may relate from the children of Israel whatever you like, but
whenever you relate from me you shall not relate an untruth.17

This is the most emphatic tradition ever related from the
Apostle on this matter. We have relied on this as well as on
other traditions in not accepting a tradition unless it is from
a trustworthy transmitter and we know the trustworthiness of
those who transmitted it from first to last.
414. Someone may ask: What evidence is there in this
tradition for what you have stated?
415. [Shafi‘1] replied: [Legal] knowledge teaches [us] that
in no circumstance has the Prophet ordered anyone to attribute
falsehood to the children of Israel or to anyone else. While
he permitted the relating of traditions from the children of
Israel, the ascription of falsehood to them was not permitted;
he merely permitted the acceptance of traditions from one
who related from them, without its being known Whether he
was truthful or untruthful.
Nor did he permit [the acceptance of traditions] from one
whose>untruthfulness was known, for it is related that [the
Prophet] said:
He who relates a tradition that he considers to be false is a liar.18

So whoever relates a tradition from a liar is not guiltless, of
falsehood because he has perceived the liar lying in his tradiM Muslim. Vol. I, pp. 66-72; Darimi, Vol. I, pp. 76-77; ShSfi'I, Musnad,

tion, and except in a few special [cases] he relies on the trust­
worthiness of the informant, or his lack thereof, for guidance
as to the truth or the falsity of the tradition. In the latter
case he can tell whether it is true or false if the transmitter
relates what cannot possibly be the case, or what is contra­
dicted by information that is better authenticated and is more
indicative of the truth.19
Since the Apostle distinguished between traditions related
on his authority and traditions from the children of Israel by
saying: ” You may relate on my authority, but do not, etc.,"
[legal] knowledge instructs u s 20 that the untruthfulness which
[the Prophet] prohibited was hidden untruthfulness, namely,
[that which might occur in a tradition] related from a person
whose truthfulness is unknown. For since untruthfulness is
prohibited in all circumstances, there is no untruthfulness
greater than that which is related on the authority of the
Prophet, God’s peace and blessings be upon him.21

Authentication of the Single-Individual Tradition
416. Someone might ask:22 What is the proof for the au­
thentication of the single-individual tradition, whether based
on the text of a narrative, an indication in it, or on consensus?
417. [Shafi*!] replied: Sufyan [b. *Uyayna] told us from *Abd
al-Malik b. 'Umayr from ‘Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Abd-Allah b.
Mas*ud from his father, that the Prophet said:
God will grant prosperity to His servant who hears my words,
remembers them, guards them, and hands them on. Many a
transmitter of law is no lawyer himself, and many may transmit
law to others who are more versed in the law than they. The
heart of a Muslim shall never harbor vindictive feelings against

three: sincerity in working for God; faithfulness to Muslims; and
conformity to the community of believers—their call shall protect
[the believers] and guard them from [the Devil’s] delusion.23

Since the Apostle has urged men to listen to his words,
guard them, and hand them on, and since the man who hands
them on is only one person, this indicates that the Apostle
ordered that no one should transmit anything from him unless
the proof were established to him to whom it was transmitted,
because what is transmitted is something lawful [to be observed]
or unlawful to be avoided, a punishment to be inflicted, a
property to be taken or paid, and advice in matters relating
to religion and wordly [life].
It also indicates that one who is not an expert in law may
transmit law; he may have learned it by heart even though
he is not an expert in the law.54 The Apostle's order that
men should follow the Muslim community is a proof that the
ijma* of the Muslims is binding.
Sufyan [b. "Uyayna] told us from Salim Abu al-Na4r [client
of 'Umar b. ‘Ubayd-Allah] from ’Ubayd-Allah b. Abl Raft*
from his father, who related that the Prophet said:
Do not let me find anyone of you who, reclining on his couch,
when confronted with an order of permission or prohibition
from me, says; We do not know [whether this is authentic or
not]; we follow only what we find in the book of God.25

Sufyan b. 'Uyayna said; Muhammad b. al-Munkadir related
to me a similar tradition from the Prophet without the names
of the transmitters.
In this case the confirmation of the narrative was from the
Apostle [himself] and they were informed that it was binding
on them, even though they did not find any relevant text in
the Book of God. This subject is discussed elsewhere in this
book.25

Yasar that a man kissed his wife while fasting and became
emotionally aroused. So he dispatched his wife [to the Prophet's
wife] to ask her opinion about the matter. She found Umm
Saiama, Mother of the believers [and wife of the Prophet],
and told her about the matter. “ The Apostle [himself] kisses
when fasting," she replied. The wife returned and told her
husband, who became increasingly worried and said: “ We are
not like the Apostle, for God may permit him [to do] what
he desires! " Thereupon the wife returned to Umm Saiama
and found the Apostle [with her], and he inquired: “ What
does this woman want? " So Umm Saiama told him about
the matter. “ Have you not told her that I do it myself? " he
remarked. “ I have told her, but her husband was not satisfied
and said: ‘ We are not like the Apostle, for God permits him
[to do] what he desires,’ ” she answered. The Apostle became
angry and said: “ By God, I am more fearful of God than you
and better informed regarding punishmentsl " 27 I have heard
someone who gave the names of all the transmitters of this
tradition, but I do not remember the names.
418.
Shaft'! said: In the Prophet’s reply to Umm Saiama,
in which he said: “ Have you not told her, etc.," an indication
that Umm Salama's narrative from him [is of the category of
traditions] which may be accepted, for the Prophet would not
have ordered her to repeat what he had said, provided what
she said contains a valid argument. The same would be true
of the wife [of the man in question] if he considered her
truthful.
Malik [b. Anas] told us from ‘Abd-Allah b. Dinar from Ibn
‘Umar, who said:
When men were performing the dawn prayer at [the mosque]
of Quba*, a messenger arrived and said: A Quranic communica­
tion was revealed to the Apostle last night ordering him to face
the qibla [of the Ka'ba]. So whereas they had been facing al-Sham
[Syria], they [immediately] turned around toward the Ka’ba.*8
** Malik, Vol. I, pp. 291-92; cf. Bukhari, Vol. I, p. 480; Muslim, Vol.
VII, pp. 215-20. Malik, however, did not approve of kissing while fasting
(a l-M u w a tia Vol.' I, p. 29S).

Shafi*i said: 2* The men of Quba’ were among the first
Muslims of the An$ar [the Prophet's supporters in Madina] 8 406
and were versed in the law and they used to face the qibla
which God had ordered them to face. They would not have
abandoned God’s [previous] command concerning the qibla
if the obligation to do so had not been established upon them,
for they had neither contacted the Apostle nor had they heard
[from him] what God had revealed concerning the change of
the qibla; so they faced the qibla in accordance with the [new
text of the] Book of God or the [new] sunna of the Prophet
as they heard it from the Apostle, and not according to a
tradition related by the public; they felt they were obligated
to change the qibla on the authority of one transmitter only
since he was considered by them a truthful person, and aban­
doned it because he told them that the Prophet had changed
the qibla. [Surely] they would not have accepted this on the
authority of one individual unless they had known that the
proof is established if the person who relates the narrative is
truthful. They would not have made such a great innovation
as this in the religion [of Islam] unless they had to do so. Nor S 407
would they have failed to inform the Apostle of what they
had done.
If the information they had accepted from a single indi­
vidual, related from the Apostle, concerning the shifting of
the qibla—which was obligatory—were [not] permissible, the
Apostle would have said to them: “ You were facing a [certain]
qibla, and it was not up to you to abandon it unless the proof
for it were established through what you heard from me, from
the public, or from more than one person [on my authority].”
Malik [b. Anas] told us from Ishaq b. ‘Abd-Allah b. Abi S40S
Talha from Anas b. Malik, who said:
When I was serving a drink made of grape-juice and dates to
Abu Talha, Abu ‘Ubayda b. al-Jarrah, and Ubayy b. Ka*b, a mes­
senger arrived saying: *Wine has just been forbidden.* There­
upon Abu Talha said: *Come, Anas, break these jars!' So Anas

took a mortar that we had and struck the jars with the bottom
of it until they broke-50

420.
Shafii said:81 These men were closely connected with
the Prophet in knowledge and position, and the Prophet’s
companions occupied a position of prominence that is not
denied by any learned man. The drink of which they were
partaking was lawful to them, but when a single person came
and informed them that wine had been declared unlawful,
Talha, the owner of the jars, ordered that they should be
broken. Neither he nor the others said that they would con­
sider the wine lawful until they should see the Apostle, who
was near by, or until they should' learn about it through
public channels. Otherwise they would not have wasted some­
thing lawful by pouring it out when they were not wasteful
people. For they would have asked the Apostle what they
should do, if they felt they were not bound to accept a single*
individual tradition, and the Apostle himself would have pro­
hibited its acceptance.
The Apostle ordered Unays to go to a certain man’s wife
who was said to have committed adultery and ordered him to
stone her if she confessed. She confessed, whereupon Unays
stoned her to death.32 This tradition has been related by
Malik [b. Anas] and Sufyan b. ‘Uyayria from al-Zuhrf from
‘Ubayn-AUah b. ‘Abd-Allah from Abu Hurayra and Zayd b.
Khalid [al-Juhani] from the Prophet. Sufyan added Shibl [b.
Mi'bad] to the list of transmitters after Abu Hurayra and
Zayd b. Khalid.

went around on his camel crying out this message to the people.**

The Apostle would not have sent a single truthful person
with his order of prohibition if that person's veracity and the
words he. reported from the Prophet were not acceptable
without question to those who were the recipients of the
Prophet’s prohibition. Furthermore, there were pilgrims with
the Apostle, and he would have been able either to go and
speak to those [who were drinking the wine] himself or to
send a number of men [on the mission], but he sent only one
man whose veracity they knew. For he would not have sent
any emissary to them unless the latter possessed [convincing]
proof that bound them to accept his words as being those of
the Apostle.
If such was the situation with the Prophet’s, as I have said,
having been in a position to send to them several men [instead
of one], it would be most appropriate for those who came
after him and who were not in a position to do. what [the
recipients of the Prophet’s instruction] could have done or
what the Prophet could have done with regard to them, to
use the same procedure in establishing the truth of the narra­
tive of a single veracious man.
Sufyan [b. <l/yayna] told us from *Amr b. Dinar from ‘Amr b.
*Abd-AIlah b. $afwan [al-Jumahi] from one of his uncles, Yazld
b. Shayban, who said:
When we were standing at a certain place at ‘Arafa, while ‘Amr

countries and diverse peoples, and Abu Bakr led the religious
rites and instructed them, on behalf of the Apostle, in their
rights and duties.88 In the meantime [the Prophet] sent *Ali
b. Abi TRlib, who recited to the assembled pilgrims on the
day of AI-Nahr some verses from the sura of Bara’a,88 en­
joining some of them to equity while encouraging others and
forbidding them to do certain things.87
Both Abu Bakr and ‘All were well-known to the people of
Makka as virtuous, religious, and truthful men, and those
pilgrims who did not know either one or-both of them could
have found someone to testify to their truthfulness and virtue.
The Apostle would not have sent a lone messenger unless the
latter’s words bore convincing proof to him to whom the
Prophet had sent the messenger.
The Prophet dispatched governors to various regions, and
the names of the men and the places to which they were sent
to are known to us. [For example], he sent Qays b. 'A$im and
al-Zibriqan b. Badr and [Malik] b. Nuwayra to their own
tribes, because they were known to them as truthful men.
A delegation from Bahrayn came [to the Prophet] and
became acquainted with the men around him. [The Prophet]
sent [Aban b.] Sa'Id b. al-'As back with them [as governor of
Baljrayn].
[The Prophet] sent Mu'adli b. Jabal to al-Yaman with
orders to lead those who followed him against those who
Resisted him.88 Since Mu'adh and his status and veracity were
known to them, the Prophet also ordered him to instruct
them in their duties toward God and to collect the obligatory

[tax] from them. So all those who were appointed [by the
prophet] as administrators [of various regions] were ordered
by him to collect [the taxes] imposed by God on the people
subject to their rule. None of those veracious men who were
sent by [the Prophet] was ever told that he was only one
individual and that he had no power to collect [the tax] until
the Apostle [himself] had been heard to say it was obligatory. 3416
I do not believe that the Prophet would have sent those who
were well known for their veracity in the provinces to which
they were sent if, as I have stated, men such as they did not
carry binding proof to those to whom they were sent.
The same applies to those men who were commanders of
[the Prophet’s] expeditions. He [the Prophet] sent an expedi*
tion against Mu*ta and appointed Zayd b. IJaritha [his freed
slave] as its commander; “ If he is killed, Ja'far shall succeed
him, and if [the latter] is killed, then Ibn Rawaha,” he said.
He also sent Ibn Unays on an expedition by himself.
All of the commanders of expeditions who were sent forth
[by the Prophet] were competent judges of the matters on
which they were sent, for they were responsible for appealing
to those who had not yet received the call [of Islam] and for
fighting those who had to be fought. The same was true of S 417
every commander and expedition leader whom [the Prophet]
sent forth, although he was in a position to send two, three,
four or more [if he had wished].
421.
Shafi’I said:59 On one occasion [the Prophet] sent
twelve messengers simultaneously to twelve rulers, inviting
them to accept Islam. Those [messengers] were sent only [to*
people] who either had already received the summons to Islam
and who had been confronted with its arguments, or who had
received [from the Prophet] letters indicating to those to
whom the messengers had been sent that the letters were from
the Prophet. He [the Prophet] was careful to choose wellknown men both as his messengers and as his commanders.
For example, he sent Dihya [b. Khalifa al-Kalbl] to the region
in which he was known. For if [the person] to whom the
•• Bfiliq ed., p. 57.

messenger was sent had not known him, he first would have
had to ascertain that he had been sent by the Prophet so as to
rid himself of any doubt as to whether it was the Apostle’s
message, thus obliging the messenger to wait'until his identity
had been certified.
The Prophet's orders of permission and prohibition were
continuously sent to his governors, and none failed to carry
them out because the Prophet sent only messengers who were
known as truthful to those to whom they were sent, and
whose veracity could be certified by those on the spot. In case
the recipient suspected that the letter carried by the messenger
had been altered, or found that there were circumstances
giving rise to a suspicion that the messenger who brought the
communication had been forgetful, it was his duty to seek
enlightenment regarding that which he suspected so that he
could carry out the orders of the Apostle after they had been
confirmed to his satisfaction.
In the same category fall the letters of the [Prophet's] suc­
cessors and their governors and the Muslim’s agreement that
the caliph, the judge, the commander, and the imam were
respectively single individuals. So they chose Abu Bakr [as
caliph], and Abu Bakr designated 'Umar. ‘Umar appointed
a council of electors to choose one man. They selected *Abd
al-Rahman b. ‘Awf, who chose *Uthman b. ‘Affan. Thus those
governors who were judges, as well as others, handed down
decisions, had their decisions executed, and imposed penalties.
Their decisions were carried out after them, and these de­
cisions were narratives handed down from them.
From what I have said concerning the sunna of the Apostle
and the consensus of the Muslims, there is indication of a
distinction among testimony (shahada), narrative -(khabar),
and a decree (hukm).
Do you not agree that the decision c a judge in favor of
one man against another is [a similar kind of] narrative
handed down by the judge on the basis of confirmed evidence
or on the basis of a confession made to him by one of the
parties upon whom it was executed? Since the judge is obliged

sh a fiT

s

R tsa la

261

to act on the basis of such a narrative according to [the best
of] his knowledge, then in accordance with the interpretation 8420
of the person who transmitted the decision, he would have
to declare [the matter in question] as lawful or unlawful on
the basis of the testimony given with regard to it.
If a judge [other than the one in the present case] related
a narrative from witnesses who testified to him against a
person who was not on trial before him, or on the basis of
confession of one of the parties to a dispute, [the judge in the
case] is not obligated to take a decision on the basis of the
evidence of the other judge, because the party was not referred
to that judge, but to him [the judge in the case], or because
the party was referred to another judge for trial. Then the
judge [in the case] makes the decision on the basis of the
testimony of one witness in addition to the other [judge], since
the latter would be regarded as [only] one witness, and the
testimony of one witness—whether he is a judge or any other
person—is not acceptable unless his testimony is supported by
that of a second witness, just as the testimony of [any] one
witness is not acceptable unless supported by that of a second S421
witness.40
422.
[Shaft1! said]: Sufyan [b. ‘Uyayna] and ‘Abd al-Wahhab
[al-Thaqafi] told us from Yahya b. Sa'Id from Sa'id b. alMusayyib; that ‘Umar b. al-Khattab decreed that [the com­
pensation] for the loss of a thumb was fifteen [camels],41 ten
for the next finger, ten for the middle finger, nine for the
finger next to the little finger, and six for the little finger.
423.. Shaft*! said: Since *Umar knew that the Prophet had
fixed the compensation of the hand at fifty [camels], and since
the hand consists of five fingers varying in attractiveness and
usefulness, he gave each of them its proportional value based
on the amount of the compensation for the hand. This was
[a decision taken] on the strength of a narrative through ana­
logical reasoning.
When, however, it was found in the letter of A1 ‘Amr b.

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

Hazm that the Prophet said: “ For every finger [the compensa­
tion] shall be ten camels,” they were inclined to follow it. But
they did not accept the letter of A1 ‘Amr until it was confirmed
to them that it was from the Apostle.*8
There are two indications in this tradition:
First, a narrative [from the Prophet] must be accepted.
Secondly, the narrative is to be accepted when it is confirmed,
even though none of the imams may ever have done anything
similar to the narrative in question. This indicates also that
if the action of one of the imams subsequently were found to
be contrary to a narrative of the Prophet, the imam's action
must be abandoned in favor of the Apostle’s narrative. It
[also] indicates that a tradition from the Apostle is self­
confirming and does not need to be confirmed by the action
of anyone else after him. For the Muslims never said: “ ‘Umar
acted differently [from the Prophet] in matters concerning the
Muhajirin 43 and the An$ar.” ** Nor did you*5 or any other
say anything about other men’s having acted differently; they
accepted traditions from the Apostle as they were bound to
do and they desisted from all acts contrary to them.
Had *Umar been aware of this tradition he would have
accepted it as he had accepted other things that emanated
from the Apostle, owing to his fear of God, his [readiness] to
carry out his obligation to obey the order of the Apostle, his
4* ShafiTs quotation from the Prophet’s letter to ’Amr is not in the text
that was reproduced by Ibn Hisham, perhaps because the text was not
reproduced in full. See Ibn Hisham’s Sira, Vol. II, pp. 961-62. Shafi'i
attaches great significance to the-Prophet’s order in this letter and argues
that if Umar had known the Prophet's order that the compensation for
the finger was ten camels, he would not have made a different decision
(see Ikhtilaf al-Hadith in Kilab al-Umm, Vol. VII, pp. 17-19). 'Umar’s
ignorance of the letter and the Prophet’s order, however, may raise doubt
as to the authenticity of the letter. The tradition cited by Shafi'i may
be found in Abu Dawud, Vol. IV, p. 188; Shawkanl, Nayl al'Awtdr, Vol.
VII, p. 61; Yahya b. Adam, Kitab al-Kharaj (Cairo, 1347/1929), p. 119.

424. Someone said: Give me an example indicating that
‘Umar changed his practice when a tradition from the Apostle
became known to him.
425. [Shafi‘1] replied: [What will be the advantage of] my
giving you one?
426. He said: Such an example will establish two rules:
First, that opinion may be accepted in case there is no sunna.
Secondly, that if the sunna reveals that one must do a certain
thing, one must abandon what he [previously] had been doing;
For one must discard all practices contrary to the sunna. One
must also abandon [the idea that] the sunna is confirmed only
by a narrative that has preceded it, for he should know that
it is not vitiated by anything that contradicts it.49

ordering him to permit the wife of Ashyam al-Dibabi fo
inherit the diya [of her husband]. So ‘Umar changed his
opinion. This tradition has been explained elsewhere.47
Sufyan [b. ‘Uyayna] toid us from ‘Amr b. Dinar and Ibn

anything that anyone has heard from the Prophet concerning

the diya]. “ Had I not heard this, I would have decided it
differently/’ said ‘Umar. Others related that [‘Umar said]:
“ We almost decided this matter on [the basis of our] own
opinion/’ **
‘Umar changed his decision on the strength of a tradition
related by aI-Dahf)ak that conflicted with his own decision.
He declared that if he had not heard that tradition he would
have arrived at a different decision and that he almost made
a decision concerning foeticide on the basis of his own opinion.
428.
Shafi'i said: [Since] the sunna specified that the diya
for a life is a hundred camels, the diya for foeticide should
be one hundred camels if the foetus is alive, and no diya if
it is dead.
When the Apostle’s order was related [to 'Umar] he deferred
to him and obeyed him despite his prior contradictory de­
cision. His own decision had been taken without his having
heard anything with reference to it from the Apostle, but
when he learned that his action was not in accord with the
Apostle’s decree, he abandoned his practice in order to obey
the Apostle’s decree and did likewise in all other matters. It
is equally incumbent upon men to act accordingly.49 [For]
M&lik [b. Anas] has told us from Ibn Shihab from Salim b.
*Abd-Allah that [the Caliph] ‘Umar returned before [visiting]
men [in Syria] on the strength of a tradition related by *Abd
al-Rahman b. *Awf. This was when he set out for Syria and
then learned that a plague had broken out there .60

have access to some of my books which I had lost [to verify
them]; but I have verified the accuracy of what I memorized

summarized it fearing that this book might become too long.
I .have, however, cited what might be sufficient without going
into every aspect of it in an exhaustive fashion.
So ‘Umar accepted the tradition of *Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Awf

Magians] and thought that they were unbelievers and not
people of the Book, he accepted the tradition of ‘Abd a!.
Ragman b. *Awf and followed it.
The tradition related by Bajala is uninterrupted; for he
[Bajala] had known 'Umar b. al-Kha^ab personally and had
served as a scribe to some of his provincial governors.83
430. Someone might say: ‘Umar might have sought for
another transmitter in addition to the one who related the
narrative to him.
431. [ShafH said]: The answer would be: ‘Umar would not
ask for another transmitter [to substantiate] a tradition re­
lated to him by a man, except for one of three possible reasons:
[First,] he may have wanted to be careful; for even though
the proof is verified by the narrative of a single person, the
narrative of two makes it even stronger. I have known [some
men] who confirmed the narrative of a single person and
sought a second narrative [to confirm it]. [If] a man possesses
a sunna from five [different] sources and a sixth is related to
him, he writes it down. For the more numerous the authori­
ties of a tradition and the better known, the better it is au­
thenticated and the more satisfactory to him who hears it.
And I have known certain judges who, although two or three
witnesses were confirmed to them as witnesses of just char­
acter, asked the person on whose behalf the testimony was
given to produce more witnesses. By this they sought to satisfy
themselves more fully. If the party on whose behalf the testi­
mony was given did not produce more than two witnesses, the
decision would have been given in his favor.
[Secondly,] it is possible that the transmitter might not
have been known [to ‘Umar], so he would suspend judgment
until another transmitter whom he knew confirmed it. Like­
wise, [a tradition] related from an unknown person, is not
acceptable. A tradition is acceptable only from someone known
to be qualified.

[Thirdly,] it is possible that the information related to
•UmaT by the transmitter was unacceptable to him; in this
case he would reject the narrative until he could find someone
else whose word was acceptable.
432. Someone might ask: In your opinion, which of these
reasons motivated 'Umar?
433. [Shafi'i] replied: According to the tradition related by
Abu Musa, it was caution, for he regarded Abu Musa as a
trusted authority.
434. If he says: W hat is your evidence?
We reply: Abu Musa’s tradition was transmitted by Malik
b. Anas from Rabl'a from more, than one of their authorities.
'Umar, however, said to Abu Musa: " I did not suspect you;
I was merely afraid that people might attribute something to
the Apostle that he did not say.” 54
435. Should he ask: Is this [not] an interrupted [tradition]?
436. [Shafi‘1 replied]: This is a well-authenticated tradi­
tion.55 For it is not permissible for an imam of the religion,
whether ‘Umar or anyone else, to accept the tradition of a
single individual on one occasion, when he is satisfied that it
is well authenticated, and reject it on another. This is never
permissible for an intelligent scholar, just as it is not per­
missible for a judge to take a decision on the basis of [the
testimony of] two witnesses on one occasion and reject them
on another, unless they have been proved wrong on grounds
disqualifying them or because of his ignorance of their just
character. For 'Umar was an extremely knowing, intelligent,
trustworthy, and meritorious man. In the Book of God is an
evidence for what I have discussed; God said:
Verily, We sent Noah to his people [Q. LXXI, 1].

And He said:
We did indeed send Noah to his people [Q. XI, 27; XXIII, 23;

And He said:
We revealed to Abraham and Ishmael [Q. IV, 161].
And He said:
And to ‘Ad [we sent] their brother Hud [Q, VII, 63; XI, 52],
And He said:
And to ThamQd [we sent] their brother Salih [Q. VII, 71; XI, 64].
And He said:
And to Midian [we sent] their brother Shu*ayb [Q. VII, 83; XI,

And He said:
The people of Lot gave the lie to those who were sent to them.
When their brother Lot said to them: *Will you not fear God?
I am for you a faithful apostle. So fear God and obey me ’ [Q.

And to His Apostle Muhammad, God’s blessings and peace
be upon him, He said:
Verily, we have revealed to thee as We have revealed to Noah
add the prophets after him [Q. IV, 161].
And He said:
Muhammad is only an apostle; apostles have passed away before
him [Q. Ill, 138}.
So [God] has given proof to His creatures through His
prophets, who were distinguished by certain signs from others,
and the tproof was clear to those who witnessed the actions
of the prophets and the indications which distinguished them
from others as well as from those who came after them. One
of them is as good as more than one, since the proof is estab­
lished by one just as well as by more than one. For [God] said:

Coin a parable for them: the people of a town when the envoys
came to it; when we sent to them two, and they called them liars;
so we sent a third as reinforcement and they said: ' To you we
are envoys.’ They said: ‘You are only human beings like our*
selves, and the Merciful has not sent down anything; you are only
speaking falsely' [Q. XXXVI, 12-14].
437. Shaft1! said: Thus God established the proof to them
by sending two and later a third [prophet]; likewise He estab­
lished it for various people by sending one, for the confirma­
tion [of the proof by more than one] does not mean that it
cannot be established by one only, if God endows him with
that which distinguishes him from those who are not prophets.

Ishaq b. Ka‘b b .‘Ujra from his paternal aunt Zaynab, daughter
of Ka‘b, who said that al-Furay’a, daughter of Malik b. Sinan,
had told her that she [al-Furay'a] went to the Prophet re­
questing him to let her return to her family among the Banu
Khudra ,67 since her husband, who had gone forth looking for
some slaves of his, had been killed by them when he met them
near al-Qaddum .68 “ I requested the Apostle to let me return
to my family since my husband left no house of his own for
me to live in," she said. “ Yes [you may return]," replied the
Apostle. So I left, but he called me back when I was either
in [my] chamber or in the Mosque, and said: “ What did you
say? " So I repeated the story of what had appeared to my
husband. “ Stay in your house until the end of the period
stipulated in the Book,” said the Prophet. “ So I passed the
period of the ‘idda, four months arid ten days," she said. When
TJthman became caliph, he sent for me and inquired about

between the An$ar and Muhajirtn on the strength of a tradi­
tion related by a woman,
Muslim [b. Khalid] told us from Ibn Jurayj from al-Hasan S45a
b. Muslim [b. Yannaq] from Tawus, who said: 1 was with
Ibn 'Abbas when Zayd b. Thabit said to him: “ Would you
rule that a woman [who has begun to] menstruate should
return from the pilgrimage before visiting the Sacred House? ”
“ It is not for me to say so,” replied Ibn 'Abbas, “ ask so-and-so,
the woman from the An$ar, whether the Prophet ordered S44o
her to do so.” Zayd b. Thabit went away laughing and said:
“ I must say that what you said is right.” *°
439. Shaft'! said: Zayd had heard an order of prohibition
[from the Prophet] against a pilgrim’s returning from the pil­
grimage before visiting the Sacred House, and thought that
it included the menstruating woman. When Ibn 'Abbas ruled
that she could return if she had visited the House after the
Day of Sacrifice (al-Nahr), Zayd took exception to it, but
when Ibn 'Abbas related to him a tradition from a woman
who was ordered to do so by the Apostle—and when the woman s«i
was asked, she confirmed the tradition—he believed the woman
and saw that the right thing for him to do was to cease dif­
fering with Ibn 'Abbas. But Ibn 'Abbas had no other proof
than the woman’s narrative.*1
440. -[Shafi'i said]: Sufyan [b. ‘Uyayna] told us from 'Amr
[b. Dinar] from Sa'Id b. Jubayr, who said: I have told Ibn
'Abbas that Nawf al-Bikall claims that Musa, the companion
of al-KhuJr, is not the Musa of the children of Israel. “ The
enemy of God had told a lie,” replied Ibn 'Abbas, for Ubayy
b. Ka'b told me that the Apostle in speaking to him once
mentioned the story of Musa and al-Khi$r in such a way as to
indicate that the Musa of the children of Israel was the Musa
who was associated with al-KhfiJr.*2
40 Ibn Hanbal, Vol. Ill, p. 307, Vol. V, p. 89. Similar traditions are
related on the authority of 'A’isha. See Malik, Vol. I, pp. 410-12; Bukhiri,
Vol. I, pp. 393, 415-16.

Thus Ibn ‘Abbas, pious and versed in the law as he was,
accepted the authenticity of a tradition related by Ubayy b.
Ka‘b from the Apostle as a proof against the opinion of a
certain Muslim. Ubayy b. Ka'b had reported to him a tradi­
tion from ;the Prophet that Musa of the children of Israel was
the same as the Companion of al-Khidr.
Muslim [b. Khalid al-Zanji] and 'Abd al-Majld told us from
Ibn Jurayj [from 'Amir b. Mu$*ab] that Tawus told him that
he asked Ibn 'Abbas about the two cycles (rak'atayn) after
the *a$r prayer, and Ibn ‘Abbas forbade him to perform them.
“ I replied: I was not going to abandon them,” said Tawus.
Thereupon Ibn ‘Abbas, [quoting the Qur'an], said:
It is n ot for any believer, m an o r woman, when G od an d his
Apostle have decreed a m atter, to have a choice in any m atter
affecting him . W hoever disobeys G od and H is A postle has gone
astray into m anifest error [Q. X X X III, 36].63

Ibn ‘Abbas was of the opinion that the proof against Tawus
was established by his tradition from the Prophet and by liis
indicating through a citation from the Book of God that both
sources deprived 'Jawds of any choice in a matter that had
been decided by God and His Apostle. Although Tawus knew
of the decision of the Apostle from a tradition related only
by Ibn ‘Abbas, he did not reject it and tell [Ibn ‘Abbas]:
"T his is a tradition related by you alone. I do not consider
that it is established as being from the, Prophet, since it is
possible that you have forgotten something with regard to it.”
441. Someone might, say: Would [Tawus] not hesitate to
say such a thing to Ibn ‘Abbas?
442. [Shaft*! replied]: Ibn ‘Abbas was above being afraid
to tell anyone the truth as he saw it. For he forbade [Tawus]
to perform the two cycles after the ‘a$r prayer and told him
Elijah, and St. George. See Ibn Hajar, a b l s a b a , Vol. I, pp, 428-47, for a
traditional account of al-Khidr’s life as a prophet. For a more critical
account, see Mcijer de Hond, D e r K o r a n i s i r t e E l b i d r (Leyden, 1914).

not to perform them before informing him that the Prophet
had prohibited them.
443. [Shafi'i said]: Sufyan [b. 'Uyayna] told us from 'Amr
[b. Dinar] from Ibn 'Umar, who said: “ We used to practice
mukhabara 64 (share cropping), seeing no harm in it until
Raft* b. Khadij claimed that the Apostle had prohibited it.
So we gave it up because of what [Raft'] had said.” 88
Thus Ibn 'Umar, who was profiting from mukhabara and
regarded it as lawful, did not continue to practise it after a
tradition was related to him by a trusted transmitter that the
Apostle had prohibited it. Furthermore, he did not use his
own judgment regarding what was related from the Apostle
and say: “ Nobody has so far reproached us for this, and we
have been practising it till now." This clearly indicates that
something that was practised after the Prophet’s death and
was not supported by a tradition from the Prophet does not
vitiate a narrative from the Prophet.68
444. [Shaft*! said]: Malik [b. Anas] told us from Zayd b.
Aslam from 'A{a* b. Yasar that Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan once
sold [either] a gold or a silver drinking cup for more than
[the value of] its weight. " I heard the Apostle prohibit that
kind [of thing],” said Abu al-Darda’ to him. “ I do not see
any harm in it," said Mu'awiya. ” Who will support me
against Mu'awiya? ” asked Abu al-Darda*. 4‘ I relate to him
[a tradition] from the Apostle, and he gives me his own
opinion. I cannot live in the same land with you [Mu'awiya],” 87
Thus Abu al-Darda* was of the opinion that the proof against
Mu'awiya was established by a narrative related to him; but
when Mu'awiya did not agree with him, he departed from
*« Mukhabara was the practice of renting the land by paying one fourth,
or one third, or any specific portion of the produce after harvest. It is
also called al-murara’a. See Jurjani, Kitab al-To'rif&t, p. 290.

Khudri met a man to whom he related something from the
Apostle; the man, however, related another narrative contra­
dictory to it. “ By God, may I never be [again] with you under
the same roof,” said Abu Sa‘Id.
446. Shaft4! said: The transmitter [Abu Said] was chagrined
because [the other man] did not accept the tradition he related
from the Prophet, but quoted another contradictory to it.
However, there were two aspects of the latter's tradition; one
of them may have conflicted with Abu Sa'id’s tradition and
the other not.

certain defect in him. So I took the case before [the Caliph]
‘Umar b. ‘Abd al-'Aziz, who made a decision in my favor that
I could return the slave but decided against me that I should
return the profit [I made on him]. When 1 called on ‘Urwa b.
ai-Zubayr and told him about the matter, he said: I shall go to
[the Caliph] this evening and tell him that ‘A’isha related to me
a tradition that the Apostle decreed that *the profit belongs to
him who bears the responsibility." So I hastened to 'Umar and
I told him what 'Urwa had related to me, on the authority of
'A’isha, from the Prophet. *What a hasty decision I have taken!
God knows that I sought nothing but what was right. Now that
you have informed me of a sunna of the Apostle concerning this
matter, I shall’revoke the decision of 'Umar and carry out the
sunna of the Apostle of God,' said 'Umar. When 'Urwa called
on 'Umar [to whom he related 'A’isha's tradition], ’Umar decided
that I should take the profit from the man in whose favor the
[earlier] decision was taken.70

Abu Sa'id al-Khudrl related to me something that the Prophet
said on the subject of exchange and it has been authenticated
as a sunna.74 He [Sa'id] says: Abu Hurayra gave me informa­
tion from the Prophet which has been accepted as an authen­

as the source of statements that have been accepted as authen­

and ending with him and agree that they may be used as the

If it is permissible for anyone to hold the view of the

[Shafi‘1] said: If it could be supposed that one person
might say that a certain tradition was related from the Prophet
in one way, while another person might say something contra­
dicting that tradition, then in my opinion it would not be
permissible for a scholar [to insist that] the tradition of a
single person be confirmed by many and use it to declare
things lawful and unlawful while he rejects others similar to
it, unless he possesses a tradition that contradicts it. For he
.considers that which he has heard and those who heard it
from [the single transmitter] as more trustworthy than those
who told him something different from it. Or he who trans­
mitted might not have been a memorizer; or he might con­ 8458
sider him suspect; or he might suspect one of the previous
transmitters; or the tradition might be ambiguous and he
might, accept one interpretation in preference to the other.
But one should not imagine that an intelligent jurist could
on one or more occasion accept the authenticity of a sunna
on the strength of a single-individual narrative and then dis­
card the same in favor of a narrative similar to or more
reliable than the previous one, except for one of those causes
that might cast doubt upon the interpretation of it (as in
the case of the commentators on the Qur'an) or because he

either suspects the transmitter, or is aware o£ a narrative con­
tradictory to it.
452. Someone might say: Few are the jurists anywhere who
have not related many traditions acceptable to them while
they have related [only] a few that were unacceptable.
453. [Shafi'I replied]: It is not permissible [for a jurist] to
reject a tradition save for one of the reasons I have discussed,
or because he is relating from one of the successors or from
someone from a succeeding generation a saying that he is not
bound to accept. He relates it only as information and does
not vouch for it; he may or may not accept it. If he does not
follow any of these courses, he would commit a great error
which would be inexcusable, although failure to follow some
of them might be forgiven.
454. Someone might ask: Has your term “ proof ” different
meanings?
455. '[Shafi'I] replied: Yes, it has; God willing.
456. He asked: What are they?
457. [Shafi'I] replied: No one shall be excused for discarding
something [that is supported by] a clear text of the Book or
a generally accepted siinna, for there is no doubt concerning
either one of them, and he who refuses to accept either one
must ask forgiveness.
But if a sunna were derived from a narrative handed down
by a few [persons] but there is disagreement concerning it
because the narrative is open to different interpretations and
came [originally] from a single source, then any argument
regarding it would be that it should be binding on those who
are informed about it. For they cannot reject it as long as
there is a text to support it, just as they are bound to accept
the testimony of witnesses of just character, since [such knowl­
edge] is as certain as the text of the Book [of God] or a narra­
tive well known to the public. So if someone were to cast
doubt upon it, we should not tell him to repent. Instead, we
should tell him that if he is a learned man he should not
doubt, just as one should take a decision only on the strength
of the testimony of witnesses of just character, even though

s h Xf i T s R i s a l a

279

they are liable to err, for one is bound to take decisions in
this regard on the basis of the apparent truthfulness (of the
witnesses], since only God knows those things about them that
are hidden from a person.
458. He asked: Can an interrupted tradition be used as an
argument by him who knows about it? Are such interrupted
traditions different from others, or are they on the same level?
459. Shafi'I replied: Interrupted traditions vary. A tradi­
tion related by one of the successors who saw one of the
Apostle’s companions but did not carry the tradition back to
8461
the Prophet should be scrutinized from various angles:
[First,] one should examine the transmission of the tradition.
If the transmitter is supported by trustworthy memorizers of
traditions who have related from the Apostle traditions of
similar meaning, this would be an indication of the sound­
ness of those who passed on the tradition.
[Secondly,] if he were the only one to relate a tradition and
no other was found to support him with a similar one, the
tradition related by one individual should be accepted.
[Thirdly,] it should be considered-whether he is supported
by any other transmitter whose traditions were accepted by
others but who did not belong to that group of men from
whom he accepted his traditions. If such is found [to be the
case], it would be an indication supporting the transmitter
of the tradition, although [such an indication] would be
weaker than the former one. In case such an indication is not
found, the information related from the Apostle by some of
his Companions should be examined. If they are found to be 3 462
in agreement with [other] traditions from the Apostle, its
transmitter took [his information] only from a sound source.
Furthermore, if scholars in general are found to have given
rulings consistent with a tradition said to have been related
from the Prophet, and if the transmitter cites as his authorities
persons who were neither unknown nor objectionable, it is
indicative of the soundness of what was related from the trans­
mitter, since such authorities constitute a proof of reliability.

280

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

IC [a transmitter] seeks the opinion of a memorizer regarding
a tradition that the latter has never contradicted, and if the
memorizer contradicts it but his tradition is found to be de­
fective, it is an indication of the soundness of the person who
gave out the transmitter’s tradition. If the opposite of what
I have described happens, then the [transmitter's] tradition is
adversely affected and no one can accept it. B u t77 if certain
indications [in favor] of the soundness of his tradition are
found by the means I have described, we should prefer to
accept his tradition.
We cannot, however, claim that the proof [for the inter­
rupted tradition] would be as good as that of an uninterrupted
[tradition]. The reason is that the interrupted tradition has
something lacking, though it may have been related from a
person who, if his name had been known, might prove to be
acceptable. But some interrupted [traditions]—even if similar
interrupted traditions agree with them—might have been re­
lated from the same source, which if known might prove to
be unacceptable. If the narrator is stating his own opinion
[regarding the soundness of the tradition], even if some of the
companions of the Prophet agree with him, it is not a strong
indication of the soundness of the source of the tradition; for
it is possible that [the transmitter] might have mistakenly
thought that some of the companions were agreeing with him
just as he might have mistakenly thought that some of the
jurists agreed with him.78
But as for those who came after the leading Successors who
so often saw some of the Companions of the Apostle, I do not
know a single one of them whose transmission would be
acceptable for various reasons. The reasons for that are: First,
they were not so particular as to those from whom they related
traditions. Secondly, there are certain indications in that
which they transmitted that betray weakness in the source
of their transmission. Thirdly, there are many variations [in

their traditions], and this raises the possibility of misunder­
standing and lack o£ reliability on the part of him from whom
it was received.
460. Shafi‘1 said:r> My experience with certain scholars in­
dicates that there are groups with [two] opposite tendencies:
Some are satisfied with meager knowledge and want to derive
knowledge from only one source, neglecting similar or more
reliable ones. These are the ones who are lacking in knowl­
edge. Others, who have criticized this approach and aspired
to a broader and thorough knowledge [of tradition], have been
driven by this [desire] to accept traditions from transmitters
from whom it would have been better hot to accept. I have
noticed that most of them are inclined to be unreliable, because
they accept [traditions] from the same transmitters whose
similar and better traditions they have rejected. They accept
traditions that are interpolated, as well as those from unre­
liable sources if they agree with their opinions, while they
reject traditions from reliable transmitters if they happen to
contradict their opinions.
Interpolations reach some of these people from various
sources. He who scrutinizes the knowledge [of traditions] with
competence and care is shocked by the [number of] inter­
rupted traditions from those who are not well-known Suc­
cessors, as shown from certain indications explicit in them.
461. He asked: Why do you distinguish between well-known
early Successors who knew [many of the] Companions of the
Apostle and those who knew only some of them?
462. [Shafi‘1] replied: Because it was quite impossible for
those who had never met most of the Companions to relate
traditions from them.
463. He asked: Why do you not accept an interrupted tradi­
tion from them or from any of the jurists who came after
them?
464. [Shafi‘i] replied: For [the reasons] that I have already
described.

465. He asked: Is there any interrupted tradition from the
Apostle that was transmitted by a reliable person but not
accepted by any of the jurists?
466. [Shafi'l] replied: Yes. For Sufyan [b. *Uyayna] has told
us. from Muhammad b. al-Munkadir, who said: A man asked
the Prophet: " O Apostle of Godl I have my own family and
property, and my father has his own family and property;
yet he wants to.take my property and use it to feed his family."
" You and your property belong to your father,” replied the
Apostle of God .80
467. He said: We do not accept this tradition; but some of
your followers accept it.
468. [Shafi'l] said: No, [we do not accept this tradition] for
he who accepts it will give [the right to] the rich father to
take the property of his son.
469. He asked: T hat is right; nobody accepts it. But why
do people dispute it?
470. [Shafii] replied: Because it is not established that it
is from the Prophet. For when God decreed that a father can
inherit from his son as others, he put him on the same basis
as other heirs. He might also receive a smaller share than
many other heirs—an indication that the son owns his property
independently of the'father.
*471. He asked: Is Muhammad b. al-Munkadir extremely
reliable in your opinion?
472. [Shafi'i] replied: Yes, he is, for he is distinguished in
matters of religion and piety; but we do not know from whom
he accepted this tradition. [You will recall that] I have ex­
plained to you the case in which two witnesses of just charac­
ter testify concerning two men ,81 and how their testimony
could not be accepted until their just character had been con­
firmed either by the two men in question or by others.
473. He asked: Will you give a tradition [in support of this
opinion]?
474. [Shaft'!] replied: Yes. The trusted authority [Yahya b.

Hassan] told us from Ibn Abi Dhi'b from Ibn Shihab, who
said: “ The Apostle ordered a man who laughed during the
performance of prayer to repeat both the ablution and the
prayer.” We did not accept this tradition because it is inter­
rupted. Then the trusted authority [also] related the same
tradition from Ma*mar from Ibn Shihab from Sulayman b.
Arqam from al-Hasan from the Prophet. We consider Ibn
Shihab to be an authority on traditions and expert in the
choice of reliable transmitters; he names some of the Com­
panions of the Prophet and prominent Successors, and we
know of no transmitter who can relate from men more reliable
or better known than those from whom Ibn Shihab relates.
475. He said: We think it strange that he related from
Sulayman b. Arqam.
476. [Shaft*! replied]: [Perhaps] he did so because he thought
that [Arqam] was a man of virtue, knowledge, and reason.
So he accepted traditions from him and had good opinion of
him, but failed to mention his name, either because Arqam
was younger than he, or for some other [reason]. But when
Ma*mar asked [Ibn Shihab] who related the tradition, he gave
him as his authority. Thus though it is possible that Ibn
Shihab may have related a tradition from Sulayman b, Arqam
[the tradition should be accepted] in view of what I have said
[in praise of] Ibn Shihab; but other [transmitters] should not
be trusted in similar cases.
477. He asked: Is there any sunna of the Apostle estab­
lished by an interrupted chain of transmitters which everybody has refused to accept.
478. [Shafi‘i] replied: No; sometimes we do find people dis­
agreeing about it among themselves, some accepting it and
others not. However, we have never found people agreeing
in opposition to a well-authenticated sunna as we have found
them to do in the case of an interrupted tradition from the
Apostle.82 .

Shafi'l said: I [also] pointed out [to the interlocutor]:
You have asked tor the proof on the basis of which an inter­
rupted tradition is rejected and you have rejected such a tradi­
tion; but you have gone too far in rejecting a well-authenticated
tradition which, in our opinion, you are under an obligation
to accept.

[ON CONSENSUS (IJMA' ) ] 1
480.
Shaft1! said: Someone has asked me: I have under­
stood your doctrine concerning God’s commands and His Apos­
tle’s orders that he who obeys God obeys His Apostle, [for]
God has imposed [on men] the duty of obeying His Apostle,
and that the proof for what you held has been established
that it would be unlawful for a Muslim who has known the
Book [of God] and the sunna [of the Prophet] to give an
opinion at variance with either one, for I know that this [i. e.
acceptance of the Book and the sunna] is a duty imposed by
God. But what is your proof for accepting the consensus of
the public [on matters] concerning which no explicit command
of God nor any [sunna] related on the authority of the
Prophet is to be found? Do you assert, with others, that the
consensus of the public should always be based on an estab­
lished sunna even if it were not related [on the authority of 8471
the Prophet]?
481.
[Shaft!] replied: T hat on which the public are agreed
and which, as they assert, was related from the Apostle, that
is so. As to that which the public do not relate [from the
Prophet], which they may or may not relate as a tradition
from the Prophet, we cannot consider it as related on the
authority of the Prophet—because one may relate only what

discussed some aspects of it in other parts of the Risala. See Chaps. VI,

he has heard, for no one is permitted to relate [on the au­
thority of the Prophet] information which may or may-not
be true. So we accept the decision of the public because we
have to obey their authority, and we know that wherever there
are sunnas of the Prophet, the public cannot be ignorant of
them, although it is possible that some are, and we know that
the public can neither agree on anything contrary to the sunna
of the Prophet nor on an error.
482. Someone may ask: Is there any evidence in support of
what you hold?
483. [Shafi'I] replied: Sufyan [b. *Uyayna] told us from *Abd
al-Malik b. 'Umayr from *Abd al-Rahman b. ‘Abd-Allah b.
Mas'ud from his father, who said: The Apostle said:
G od will g ra n t prosperity to His servant who hears my words,
rem em bers them , guards them, and hands them on. Many a trans­
m itter of law is no lawyer himself, and m any may transm it law
to others w ho are m ore versed in the law than they, etc.2

And Sufyan [also] told us from 'Abd-Allah b. Abl Labld
from ‘Abd-Allah b. Sulayman b. Yasar from his father, who
said: 'Umar b. al-Khattab made a speech at al-Jabiya in which
he said: The Apostle of God stood among us by an order from
God, as I am now standing among you, and said:
Believe my C om panions, then those who succeed them [the Suc­
cessors], an d after th a t those who succeed the Successors; b u t after
them untru th fu ln ess will prevail w hen people w ill swear [in
su p p o rt of th eir saying] w ithout having been asked to swear, and

unhappy w ith his w rong behavior, is a [true] believer.8

to follow the community?
485. [Shafi'I] replied: There is but one meaning for it.
486. He asked: How is it possible that there is only one
meaning?
487. [Shafi'i] replied: When the community spread in the
lands [of Islam], nobody was able to follow its members who
had been dispersed and mixed with other believers and unbelievers, pious and impious. So it was meaningless to follow
the community [as a whole],4 because it was impossible [to do
so], except for what the [entire] community regarded as lawful
or unlawful [orders] and [the duty] to obey these [orders].
He who holds what the Muslim community holds shall be
regarded as following the community, and he who holds
differently shall be regarded as opposing the community ht
was ordered to follow. So the error comes from separation:
but in the community as a whole there is no error concerning
the meaning of the Qur'an, the sunna, and analogy.*

[ON ANALOGY (QIYAS) ' ] 1
488.
He asked: On what ground do you hold that [on
matters] concerning which no text is to be found in the Book, B 65
nor a sunna or consensus, recourse should be had to analogy?
Is there any binding text for analogical deduction?
489. [Shaft*!] replied: If analogy were [stated] in the text
of the Book or the sunna, such a text should be called either
God's command or the Apostle’s order rather than analogy.
S476
490. He asked: What is analogy? Is it ijtihad, or are the
two different?
491. [Shaft*!] replied: They are two terms with the same
meaning.
492. He asked: What is their common [basis]?
493. [Shaft*!] replied: On all matters touching the [life of a]
Muslim there is either a binding decision or an indication as
to the right answer. If there is a decision, it should be fol­
lowed; if there is no indication as to the right answer, it should
be sought by ijtihad, and ijtihad is qiyas (analogy) .2
494. He asked: If the scholars apply analogy correctly, will
they arrive at the right answer in the eyes of God? And will
it be permissible for them to disagree [in their answers] through
analogy? Have they been ordered to seek one or different

answers for each question? What is the proof for the position 34 7 7
that they should apply analogy on the basis of the literal
rather than the implicit meaning [of a precedent], and that it
is permissible for them to disagree [in their answers]? Should
[analogy] in matters concerning the scholars themselves be
applied differently from the way it is applied in matters con­
cerning others? Who is the person qualified to exercise ijtihad
through analogy in matters concerning himself, not others,
and who is the person who can apply it in matters concerning
himself as well as others?
495.
[Shafi'I] replied: [Legal] knowledge is of various kinds:
The first consists of the right decisions in the literal and im­
plied senses; the other, of the right answer in the literal sense
only. The right decisions [in the literal and implied senses]
are those based [either] on God’s command or on a sunna of
the Apostle related by the public from an [earlier] public.
These [God’s commands and the sunna] are the two sources
by virtue of which the lawful is to be established as lawful and
the unlawful as unlawful. This is [the kind of knowledge] of
which nobody is allowed to be ignorant or doubtful [as to its
certainty].
Secondly, [legal] knowledge of the specialists consists of
traditions related by a few and known only to scholars, but 8 478
others [the public] are under no obligation to be familiar with
it. Such knowledge may either be found among all or a few
[of the scholars], related by a reliable transmitter from the
Prophet. This is the [kind of},knowledge which is binding
on scholars to accept and it constitutes the right decision in
the literal sense such.as we accept [the validity of] the testi­
mony of two witnesses.3 This is right [only] in the literal sense,
because it is possible that [the evidence of] the two witnesses
might be false.

reasoning] through qiyas [analogy], by virtue of which right
decisions are sought. Such decisions are right in the literal
sense to the person who applies analogy, not to the majority
of scholars, for nobody knows what is hidden except God.
496. [He asked]: If [legal] knowledge is derived through
analogy—provided it is rightly applied—should [the scholars]
who apply analogy agree on most [of the decisions], although
we may find them disagreeing on some?
497. [Shafi'i replied]: Analogy is of two kinds: the first, if
the case in question is similar to the original meaning [of the
precedent], no disagreement on this kind [is permitted]. The
second, if the case in question is similar to several precedents,
analogy must be applied to the precedent nearest in resem­
blance and most appropriate. But those who apply analogy
are likely to disagree [in their answers].
498. He asked: Will you give examples known to me ex­
plaining that [legal] knowledge is of two kinds, the one con­
sisting of the right decisions in literal and implicit senses, and
the other of the right decisions in the literal, not the implicit,
sense?
499. [Shafi'i] replied: If we were in the Sacred Mosque and
the Ka'ba is in sight, do you not agree that we should face it
[in prayer] with certainty?
500. He said: T hat is right.
501. Shafi'i asked: [Since] the duties of prayer, [the pay­
ment of] the alms, performance of pilgrimage, and the like
have been imposed on us, are we not under obligation to per­
form them in the right ways?
502. He replied: T hat is right.
503. [Shafi'i] asked: Since the duty imposed on us to punish
the fornicator with a hundred stripes, to scourge him who
casts an imputation [of adultery] with eighty, to put to death
him who apostatizes, and to cut off [the hand of] him who
steals, are we not under obligation to do so [only] to him
whose offence is established with certainty on [the basis of]
his admission?

505. [Shafi'I] asked: Should not [the decisions] be the same
whether we were obligated to take them against ourselves or
others, although we realize that we know about ourselves what
others do not know, and we do not know about others by
outward observation what we know about ourselves inwardly?
506. He replied: That is right.
507. [Shafi'I] asked: Are we not under obligation to face
the Sacred House [in prayer] wherever we may be?
508. He replied: T hat is right.
509. [Shafi'I] asked: Do you hold that we [could always]
face the Sacred House correctly?
510. He replied: No, not always as correctly as when you
were able to see [the Sacred House]; however, the duty im­
posed on you was fulfilled.
511. [Shafi'I] asked: Is our obligation to seek the unknown
object different from our obligation to seek the known object? S 481
512. He replied: That is right.
515.
[Shafi'I] asked: Are we not obligated to accept the just
character of a man on the basis of his outward behavior, and
establish marital and inheritance relationship with him on
[the basis of] his outward acceptance of Islam?
514. He replied: That is right.
515. [Shafi'I] said: Yet he may not be just in character
inwardly.
516. He replied: That is quite possible; but you are under
no obligation to accept save what is explicit.
517. [Shafi'I] asked: So is it not lawful for us to establish
marital and inheritance relationship with him, and to accept
his testimony, and is it not unlawful Cor us to kill him on the
basis of [our] explicit [knowledge] of him? But if others should
discover him to be an unbeliever, would it not be lawful for
them to kill him and to repudiate marital and inheritance
relationship or whatever else he had been permitted to do?
518. He replied: T hat is right.
519. [Shafi'I] said: Thus the obligation imposed on vs
toward the same person differs In accordance with the degree
of our understanding of it and others' understanding of it.

520. He replied: Yes, for each one fulfils his obligation on
the basis of his own understanding.
521. [Shaft*!] said: Thus we hold concerning matters on
which there is no binding explicit text that these should be
sought by ijtihad—through qiyas—because We are under obli.
gation to arrive at the right answers according to us.
522. He asked: Are you not seeking the answer to one
question through different means?
523. [Shafi'1] replied: Yes, whenever the grounds are dif­
ferent.
524. He asked: Give me an example.
525. [Shaft*!] replied: If a man admits an obligation on his
part to God or to another person, I should take a decision
against him on the strength of his admission; if he does not
admit, I should take the decision on the evidence established
against him; if no evidence can be established against him,
I should take the decision on the basis of an oath taken by
him which might acquit him; if he refuses [to take the oath],
I should ask the other party to take an oath and I should
make the decision against him on the basis of the oath of the
other party. It is understood that [one's own] admission against
himself—owing to [one’s natural] covetousness and greed—is
more certain than the evidence of others, since they might
make a mistake or tell a lie against another. The evidence of
witnesses of just character against a person should be regarded
as nearer to the truth than [the accused] refusal to take an
oath, or [nearer to the truth] than the oath taken by the other
party [against him], since the latter might not be just in
character. Thus the decision is taken on several grounds, some
of them stronger than others.
526. He said: That is all right, but if he refuses to take an
oath, we [the IJanaf! School] will tak“ the decision [against
him] on the ground of his refusal.
527. [Shafi*!] said: But you will have taken a decision on
an evidence weaker than ours.
528. He said: Yes; however, I disagree with you on the
source of evidence [on the strength of which you have taken
the decision].

529. [Shafi‘1] said: The strongest evidence for your decision
was his admission, although one is liable to make an un­
founded or erroneous admission [on the strength of which] a

530. He said: T hat is correct; for you are under no other
obligation than that.
531. [Shafi'i] asked: Do you not agree that we are under an
obligation to take the right decision by one of two means:
Either by certainty based on the literal and implicit meanings,
or by certainty based on literal, not implicit meaning?
532. He replied: Yes, but is there any explicit text in the
Book or the sunna in support [of your opinion]?
533. [Shafi’i] said: Yes, in such examples as I have [already]
discussed concerning the determination of the qibla for myself
and others. [For] God said:

8484

And they comprehend not anything of His knowledge save what
He willeth [Q. II, 256].»

Thus God endowed knowledge to man in whatever amount
or way He wanted; no one shall raise an objection to His
decision; for He is quick at reckoning.6
And He said to His Prophet:
They ask thee about the Hour: 1When is its arrival? ’ What hast
thou to do with the mention of it? To thy Lord is its final
coming [Q. LXXIX, 42-44].

Sufyan b. 'Uyayna told u s T from al-Zuhr! from ‘Urwa, who
said:
The Prophet went on inquiring about the Hour until God com­
municated to him: 'W hat hast thou to do with the mention of
it?' [Q. LXXIX, 43] so he stopped.

And God said:
Say: No one in the heavens or on earth knows the unseen except
God [Q. XXVII, 66].

And God, the Blessed and Most High, said:
With God is the knowledge of the Hour; He sends down the
rain, He knows what is in the womb. No person knows what he
will gain tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will
die. Verily God is all-knowing, All-aware [Q. XXXI, 54],
So men are under obligation to hold opinions and to act
in accordance with what they have been ordered [to do], pro­
vided that they do not exceed the limits. However, they can­
not reward themselves; only God can reward. So we ask God
to reward us for fulfilling our duties to Him and to enlarge
His reward [to us].

He asked: On what ground do you hold that [the
exercise of] ijtihad is permitted in addition to what you have
already explained?
535. [Shafi*!] replied: It is on the basis of God's saying:
From whatever place thou issuest, turn thy face in the direction
of the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be, turn your faces
in its direction [Q. II, 145].*
Regarding him Who [wishes to] face the Sacred Mosque [in
prayer] and whose residence is at a distance from it, [legal]
knowledge instructs [us] that he can seek the right direction
through ijtihad on the basis of certain indications [guiding]
toward it. For he who is under an obligation to face the
Sacred House and does not know whether he is facing the
right or wrong direction may be able to face the right one
through certain indications known to him [which help him]
to face it as accurately as he can, just as another person may
know other indications which help to orient him [in the right

direction], although the direction sought by each person may

'"‘1336. He asked: If I agree with you on this [matter], I should
agree with you on the permissibility of disagreement in other
matters.
537. [Shaft*!] replied: You may hold whatever opinion you
like.
538. He asked: I hold that [that disagreement] is not per­
missible.
539. [Shaft*!] asked: Let us [assume that] you and I, who
know [the direction of] this road, [hold different opinions]:
I hold.that the qibla is in this direction; but you may disagree
with' me. Who should follow the opinion of the other?
540. He replied: Neither one is under an obligation to
follow the other.
541. [Shaft*!] asked: What should each one do?
542. He replied: If I hold that neither one should perform
the prayer until he is certain [of the right direction], both
might not know with certainty the unknown object. Thus
either the prayer [duty] should be abandoned, or the obliga­
tion of the qibla waived so that each one can pray in whatever
[direction] he wishes. But I am not in favor of either one of
these two [opinions]—I am rather bound to hold that each one
should pray in the direction he believes [is right] and he would
be under no obligation to do otherwise. It is also possible to
hold that while each one is ordered to seek the right [solution]
on the strength of the literal and the implicit meaning [of the
duty], neither shall be responsible for the error [which might
be committed], in the implicit—not the literal—meaning [of
the duty],
543. [Shaft*!] said: Whatever opinion you may hold is a
proof against you, because you have distinguished between
[the validity of] decisions taken in the literal and the implicit
[senses], a distinction for which you have already criticized us

by saying: “ If they disagree [on die qibla, etc.]/' * one of them
must be in error.
544. He replied: T hat is right [I did].
545. [Shafri] asked: You have held that the prayer was per­
missible despite your awareness that one of them was in error;
it is even possible that both may have been in error. I have
added: Such [a distinction] would be binding on you in [the
cases of] testimonies and analogical deduction.
546. He replied: I hold that [such an error] is inevitable,
but it is not intentional.
547. [Shafi'i] said: God said:

8489

O belivers, do not kill the game when you are in pilgrim sanctity;
whosoever of you kill it intentionally, there shall be compensa­
tion equal to what he has killed, in flocks as shall be judged by
two men of just'character among you, an offering to be delivered
at the Ka'ba [Q. V, 96].

Thus God ordered [men] to pay compensation [in kind], to
be determined by two men of just character. Since the eating
of game in general was prohibited, compensation for animals
taken by hunting shall be by other [edible animals] equal to
their size. Some Companions of the Prophet made decisions
[to the effect] that the compensation for the hyena is a ram,
for the gazelle a goat, for the rabbit a she-goat, and for the
jerboa a kid.5 [Legal] knowledge instructs [us] that equal com­
pensation means compensation in kind, not in prices, for if
decisions were taken on the basis of prices they woiHd vary,
owing to the variation of the prices of game from qne town
and one time to another, even though legal decision^should
be the same.
Knowledge instructs [us] that the jerboa is not quite equal
in size to the kid, but since it is the nearest in size, it is regarded'
as equal [for this purpose]. This kind of analogy is closer to
[the analogy of] the goat and the deer than to that of the kid
and the jerboa.
4 See Paragraph 536, above.
* A jafra is a small kid about four months of age. For the Companions'
decision, see ShawkanI, Nayl ai-Awfdr, Vol. V, pp. 18-19; Shafi'i, Kit&b-alUtrm, VoL II, pp. 175-76.

548. Shaft'! said: 4 In the event equal compensation in kind
is for four-footed game—not birds—[such compensation] is per­
missible only in accordance with ‘Umar's opinion that game
killed shall be compensated for in kind by another animal
nearest in resemblance to it. If the game killed is larger, com­
pensation shall be made by another animal nearest in size to
it, as in the case of the hyena, the compensation for which is
a ram; and the jerboa, though smaller than the little she-goat,
a kid.
Since game birds do not resemble cattle, owing to differences
in their physical make up, compensation for those which are
not lawfully edible shall be made on the basis of precedent
and analogy by paying their price to the owner. It is agreed 7
[among the scholars] that the decision as to the price should
be on the basis of the price [of the game] in the place and the
day [it was killed], for [prices] vary from one place and time
to another, so that the price of a bird in one place may be one
dirham and in another only a fraction of a dirham.
549. Shaft'! said: 8 We are ordered to accept the testimony
of [witnesses of] just character. Thus, if the acceptance of [the
testimony of]* “ just character ” is stipulated, the indication is
that we should reject [the testimony] of those who are not [of
just character], [Since] there is no sign in the body or speech
of the witness of just character which distinguishes him from
the witness lacking.it, such a sign should be sought in the
truthfulness reflected in his behavior. Thus if his behavior
were on the whole good—although certain things may be
lacking, as nobody, as far as we know, is [completely] devoid
of sin—[his testimony] must be accepted. If his sins and good
deeds are mixed, only by ijtihad may the good be distinguished
from the bad, but in such a case the mujtahids are liable to
disagree. If the just character [of a person] is apparent his
testimony must be accepted by us; but if another person finds
him deficient in just character, the testimony must be rejected.

Thus two judges may take a decision in which one of them
accepts [a testimony] while the other rejects it. This is [an
example of] disagreement,^ but each judge has fulfilled his duty.
550. He asked: Will you cite a tradition permitting [the
exercise of] ijtihad?
551. [Shafi'i] replied: *Abd al-'Aziz b. Muhammad [al-Darawardi] told us from Yazld b. ‘Abd-Allah [b. Usama] b. al-Hadi
from Muhammad b. Ibrahim [al-Tayml] from Busr b. Sa'Id
from Abi Qays [the client of 'Amr b. al-‘A$] from 'Amr b.
al-'As, who heard the Prophet say:
If a judge makes the right decision through ijtihad, he shall be
doubly compensated; if he errs, he shall be compensated once.10
'Abd al-‘Aziz b. Muhammad told us from Yazid b. al-Hadi,
who said: I have related that tradition to Abu Bakr b. Mu­
hammad b.'Amr b. Plazm, who said: The tradition was related
to me by Abu Salama b. *Abd al-Rahman from Abu Hurayra.
552. He said: This is a narrative transmitted by one in­
dividual which other [scholars] reject and [for which they]
demand a proof [for its authenticity].
553. [Shafi'i] replied: You and I are capable of establishing
its authenticity.

already stated concerning the authentication [of such a tradi­
tion] as well as others.11 Which 12 part [of the tradition] is in
question?
556. He asked: Did not the Prophet specify in what you
related from h im 13 [what kind of] ijtihad is right and [what
kind is] wrong?

559. [Shafi'i] replied: Because the Prophet stated that [the
judge] shall be rewarded for the one [i. e., the right kind of
ijtihad] more than for the other [the wrong]; but rewards are
not granted for things forbidden nor for intentional errors.
For if he [the judge] were ordered to exercise ijtihad on the
basis of the literal meaning [of the text], and his ijtihad was
indeed on the basis of the literal meaning [of the text], his
error would be forgiven, as I have pointed out. But the
punishment for an error which is not permissible is not for­
givable as far as I can see; however, God might forgive him.
This is [another] example for what I have already discussed
that one is ordered to exercise ijtihad on the strength of the
explicit, not the implicit meaning [of the text].
560. He asked: This may well be, as you hold; but what is
the meaning of “ wrong " and “ rig h t"?
561. [Shafi‘1] replied: Their meaning is the same as that
[explained in the example] of the qibla. He who can see it
with certainty would face it correctly; but if it is out of sight,
whether he [the person facing it] is at a distance or close to it,
he should search for it. So some may face it correctly and
others wrongly. Thus the facing itself is liable to be right or
wrong, just as if one intends to relate a certain narrative con­
cerning right or wrong, he says: So-and-so is right in seeking
[the right solution] for he did not fall into error, but so-and-so
fell into error although he sought [the right solution].
562. He said: It is as you hold; but do you not agree that
ijtihad might be right in a different sense?
563. [Shafi'i] replied: Yes; for one is under an obligation
to exercise ijtihad only in the search for an unknown object.
If one does so, he would be right by doing what he was obli­
gated to do.' This is right for him on the basis of the literal
meaning [of the text]; only God knows the implicit meaning.
For we know that those who disagree in their search for the
qibla cannot be right if the qibla is in sight; but they would
be right in seeking it by ijtihad even though they may disagree [on how to face it]. The same [reasoning] may be
applied in such cases as [the testimony of] witnesses and others
which I have described.

564. He asked: Will you give an example?
565- [Shafi'i] replied: I do not think it would be explained
S 496
by a stronger example than this.
566. He asked: Will you give a different example?
567. [Shafi'l] replied: God has made it lawful to marry two
or three or four women and what our right hand possesses;
but he made it unlawful [to marry] mothers, daughters, and
sisters.
568. He said: T hat is correct.
569. [Shafi'i] asked: If a man purchases a slave-woman,
whom he found clear of pregnancy, is she lawful to him?
570. He replied: Yes.
571. [Shafi'i] asked: after he had gone into her and she had
given children, he discovered that she was his sister. What is
[your] opinion about such [a situation]?
572. He replied: His [intercourse with her] was lawful until
he found out about her [that she was his sister]; but once he
knew it she was no longer lawful to him.
573. [Shafi'i] asked; So one may hold that the same woman
was both lawful and unlawful to one man, although neither 6 499
he nor she was responsible for the [wrong] act?
574. He replied: In the implicit sense she was his sister
from the beginning to the last; but in the explicit sense she
was lawful to him so long as he did not know she was his
sister,. and unlawful after he became aware of it. O th er14
scholars might hold that he committed an offence, but the
punishment wouldH>e waived.
575. [Shafi'i] said: Whatever [the scholars] hold, they have
distinguished between the explicit and the implicit [meanings
of] decisions, waiving the penalty for him who exercises ijtihad
on the strength of an explicit decision—despite the fact that
he committed an error—but they do not waive it in the case
of an intentional offence.
576. He replied: That is correct.
577. [Shafi'i] said: Similarly, a man might marry an un­
lawful woman unknowingly or take a fifth [wife] who turned

out to be his [former] wife, after the death of one of the four'
and so forth.
578. He said: Yes, there are many other similar situations.
B u t18 it is clear to those of you who are certain of truthful
information that ijtihad should never be resorted to except
in seeking an unknown object by means of certain indications,
although it is permissible to those who exercise ijtihad to dis­
agree [in their decisions].
And he asked: How is ijtihad [to be exercised]?
579. [Shafi‘1] replied: God, Glorified and Praised be He,
has endowed men with reason by which they can distinguish
between differing viewpoints, and He guides them to the truth
either by [explicit] texts or by indications [on the strength of
which they exercise ijtihad].
580. He asked: Will you give an example?
581. [ShafiTJ replied: God erected the Sacred House and
ordered men to face it [in prayer], when it is in sight, and to
seek its direction [by ijtihad] when they are at a distance from
it. And He created for them the heaven and the earth and
the sun and the moon and the stars and the seas and the
mountains and the wind [as guiding indications by which
they can exercise ijtihad]. For God said:
It is He who has appointed for you the stars, that by them you
might be guided in the darkness of land and sea [Q. VI, 97].

And He said:
And landmarks and by the stars they might be guided [Q. XVI,
16].

Thus [God] instructed men to be guided by the stars and
[other] indicators, and by His blessing and help they know
the direction of the Sacred House. So those who can see it
from their places [may perform the prayer] and those who
cannot see it should either be informed by those who have
seen it or seek guidance by means of certain indications such
as a mountain, which might point to [the direction], or a star

shafiT s

R isa la

303

indicating the north and south, or the sun, whose rising and
setting is known, pointing out the direction for him who per­
forms the evening [prayer], or the seas [which might also be
a guiding indication] and the like.
Thus men should seek, through the reasoning power which
God has implanted in them, the direction in which He made
it incumbent for them to face [during prayer]. If it is thus
sought, through their reasoning power and their knowledge
of the indications [pointing to it], men can fulfil their duty.
[God] has made it clear that the duty He imposed on them
is [to pray in] the direction of the Sacred Mosque, not always
to face the House [al-Ka*ba] itself. If the right direction is not
known with the same certainty as is possessed by those who
see it, it is not permissible to hold that one can face any
direction one wishes without [a guiding] indication.

Chapter X I V

[ON JURISTIC PREFERENCE

582.
He said: I agree with you that ijtihad should
not be exercised except for a specific object, and the object
must be something definite that can be determined by means 5503
of evidence or resemblance to an established object. Thus,
it should be clear that it is unlawful for anyone to exercise
istihsan whenever it is not called for by a narrative, whether
the narrative is a text of the Qur'an or a sunna, by virtue of
which an [unknown] object is sought,2 just as when the Sacred
House is out of sight it should be sought by analogy. So
nobody is allowed to give an opinion save through ijtihad,
and this, as you said, is seeking [to know] the right answer.
Thus would you hold that it is permissible for anyone to
exercise istihsan by means other than analogy?
583.
[Shaft*!] replied: It is not permissible for everyone
in my opinion, [to do so], for only the scholars—not others—
may give an opinion, and the scholars hold that a narrative
must be followed; if a narrative is not found, analogy might
be applied on the strength of a narrative. For if analogy were B69
1Bulaq ed., p. 69. This subject is also discussed in a separate treatise
entitled K ita b Ib ta l al-Istihsan (see Shafi'i, K ita b a l-U m m , Vol. VII, pp.
267-70, 270-77.)
2 Literally: “ an object is sought by the mujtahid" (i. e., the person
who exercises the istihsan) .

abandoned, it would be permissible for any intelligent man,
other than the scholars, to exercise istihsan in the absence of
a narrative. But to give an opinion based neither on a narra­
tive nor on analogy, as I have already stated in the discussion
on the Qur’an and the sunna, is not permissible according to
[the rules of] analogy.
584. He asked: The Qur’an and the sunna give, indeed,
evidence in support [of ijtihad]. For since the Prophet gave,
an order to exercise ijtihad, it should not be exercised save
to seek an [unknown] object, and the object cannot be sought
except through certain evidences [on the strength of] which
analogical deduction may be made. Will you point out what
are the analogy and the evidences which you have explained?
585. [Shafi'I] replied: Do you not agree that if a man in­
jured the slave of another the scholars would not ask a [third]
man to fix the price of the slave, whether male or female,
unless he were well informed about the market prices in order
to estimate two prices [i. e. the market price and the estimated
price] by which he would inform you of the price of a similar
slave on that day? For such [pricing] cannot be done except
on the basis of the [man's] knowledge of similar cases on the
strength of which he applies analogy. So whoever deals with
property should not be asked to estimate the price unless he
is well informed [about the market price].
So it is not permissible to ask a jurist of just character who
is not acquainted w'ith the prices of slaves [the question]:
“ W hat is the price of this male or female slave?," or “ What is
the wage of this worker? ” for if he estimates such prices with­
out regard to similar prices, he is making his estimate wrongly.
If that is the case in such matters as the pricing of property
of little value, concerning which an error might easily be com­
mitted by one man against another, it is all the more necessary
that God’s orders as to what is right and wrong should not be
applied by treating a cast without due consideration or by
dealing with it on the basis of istihsan. Istihsan is merely
doing w’hat is agreeable.
No one except a well-informed scholar fully acquainted

with the [binding] narratives should exercise it [analogy]. And
he who exercises it should do so only on the basis of [legal]
knowledge, and legal knowledge consists of the binding narra­
tive on the strength of which analogy may be applied by
means of certain indications as to what is right. So the scholar
should always follow a narrative or have recourse to analogical
deduction on the strength of such a narrative, just as [in
prayer] one should either face the Sacred House when it is in
sight or seek the direction in which it lies by the exercise of
ijtihad through certain landmarks [when it is out of sight].
If he [the scholar] were to give an opinion based neither on
a binding narrative nor on analogy he is more liable to commit
a sin than is an ignorant person, if it were permissible for the
latter to give an opinion. For God has not permitted any
person since the Prophet’s time to give an opinion except on
the strength of established [legal] knowledge. [Legal] knowl­
edge [after the Prophet’s death] includes the Qur'an, the sunna,
consensus, narrative, and analogy based on these [texts], as I S50a
have already explained.
Nobody should apply analogy unless he is competent to do
so through his knowledge of the commands of the Book sjog
of God: its prescribed duties and its ethical discipline, its
abrogating and abrogated [communications], its general and
particular [rules], and its [right] guidance. Its [ambiguous]
communications should be interpreted by the sunna of the
Prophet; if no sunna is found, then by the consensus of the
Muslims; if no consensus is possible, then by analogical
deduction.
No one is competent to apply analogy unless he is con­
versant with the established sunna, the opinions of [his] prede­
cessors, the agreement (consensus) and disagreement of the
people, and has [adequate] knowledge of the Arabic tongue.
Nor is he regarded as competent in analogical [reasoning]
unless he is sound in mind, able to distinguish between closely
parallel precedents, and not hasty in expressing an opinion
unless he is certain of its correctness. Nor shall he refrain
from listening to the opinions of those who may disagree with

s h a f i T s R isa la

307

him, for he might be warned against [possible] forgetfulness
or be confirmed in his right [judgment]. In so doing he must
exert his utmost power not to be misled by personal [bias],
so that he knows on what ground he has given one opinion
and on what ground he has rejected another. Nor should he
be more preoccupied with the opinion he has given than with
the one with which he disagrees, so that he knows the merits
of what he accepts as compared with that which he rejects.
He who possesses a mature mind but lacks the other quali­
fications we have described should not be permitted to express
an opinion based on analogy, for he might not know the prece­
dent on which he applies analogy just as a jurist of sound
mind should not be permitted to estimate what a dirham will
buy if he lacks the information on market [prices]. And he
who possesses the [legal] knowledge I have described [solely]
through memory, and is uncertain of its correctness, should
not be permitted to express an opinion based on analogy, for
he may not comprehend the meaning [of that knowledge].
Moreover, if he were good in memory but were lacking
either in comprehension or in knowledge of the Arab tongue,
he should not be permitted to apply analogy, for he would
be lacking in the tool by means of which he applies analogy.
However, we do not maintain that it is permissible only to
follow [precedents] and not to use analogy.8 But God knows
bestl
586. Someone asked: Will you give some examples of
[binding] narratives on the strength of which analogy might
be applied, and how would you apply it?
587. [Shafi'I] replied: Every order laid down by God or by
the Apostle for which there is evidence, either in itself or in
some other of the orders of God or His Apostle, was laid down
for some reason. If a case should arise for which there is no
[specific] textual order, it should be decided on the strength
of the case identical to it in reason for which a [specific] order
was laid down.
Analogy is of various kinds, and all are included under the

term “ analogy.” They differ from one another in the ante­
cedence of the analogy of either one of them, or its source, or
the source of both, or the circumstance that one is more clear
than the other. The strongest kind [is the deduction] from an
order of prohibition by God or the Apostle involving a small
quantity, which makes equally strong or stronger an order of
prohibition involving a great quantity, owing to the [com­
pelling] reason in the greater quantity. Similarly the com­
mendation of a small act of piety implies the presumably
stronger commendation of a greater act of piety; and similarly
an order of permission involving a great quantity would
render permissible something involving a smaller quantity.4
588. Someone may say: Give an example of each one of
these to explain their meaning.
589. [Shafi'I] said: The Apostle said:
God has p ro h ib ited the shedding of the believer's blood an d the
taking away of his property, an d [ordered] th a t only w hat is good
should be thought of him .5

If [God] has made it unlawful for [the believer] to be
thought of in any way contrary to the good which he mani­
fests, then the thing greater than the thought implying in any
way what is contrary to his good such as telling an untruth
about him, should be all the more unlawful. The more this
matter is indulged in, the stronger the order of prohibition
becomes. [For] God said:
W hoever has done a particle's w eight of good, he shall see it;

Thus what is greater than a pa: tide’s weight of good is a
greater commendation [of an act of piety] and what is greater
than a particle’s weight of evil is a greyer sin.®

of combatant unbelievers, excepting those who have made a
compact [with u$], prohibiting nothing that I remember. So
whatever we take of their bodies, except their life-blood, and
of their property, except the whole of it, is all the more lawful.
Some scholars refuse to call these [rulings] analogical deduc­
tion, for they hold that they fall within the meaning of what
God has made either lawful or unlawful, and has either com­
mended as an act of piety or repudiated; these things are
included in the general order itself rather than an analogy
based on another order. Similarly this is applicable to other
matters: whatever is equivalent (ft ma*na) to something lawful
is lawful and what is equivalent to something unlawful is
unlawful. They refuse to call anything an analogy unless there
is a parallel precedent which can be determined in one of two
ways, one of them being chosen as the answer to the exclusion
of the other. Other scholars hold that any [ruling] other than
the [explicit] text of the Book and the sunna is analogy, pro­
vided it is in harmony with their meaning. But God knows
best.7
590. Someone said: Give examples of analogy that illus­
trates its varieties of clarity and arguments and the proof for
it, other than those already stated, which the public can
understand591. [Shaft*!] replied: God said:
M others shall suckle th e ir children two full years, fo r anyone
w ho wishes the period of suckling to be com plete. It is for the
father to provide for his [daughters] a n d clothe them honorably
[Q. II, 233].

And He said:

no fault of yours w hen you h a n d over w hat you have given

for her and her children without asking his permission, since
they were his children.8
592.
[Shafi'I] said: Thus the Book of God and the surma
of the Prophet indicate that it is [the duty] of the father to
see to it that his children are suckled and that they are sup. S5l7
ported as long as they are young.
Since the child is [an issue] of the father, he [the father] is
under an obligation to provide for the child's support while
[the child] is unable to do that for himself. So I hold by
analogical deduction when the father becomes incapable of
providing for himself by his earnings—or from what he owns—
then it is an obligation on his children to support him by
paying for his expenses and clothing. Since the child is from
the father, he [the child] should not cause him from whom
he comes to lose anything, just as the child should not lose
anything belonging to his children,9 because the child is from
the father. So the forefathers, even if they are distant, and the
children, even if they are remote descendants, fall into this
category. Thus I hold that [by analogy] he who is retired,10
and in need should be supported by him who is rich and
[still] active.11
The Prophet made a decision that a slave sold with a defect sjm
which became known only after he was employed could be
returned, with the purchaser retaining the profit [derived from
the slave’s employment] on the ground that he was responsible
for the slave [during the latter's employment].12
We conclude that if it were not stipulated in the sale trans­
action that the profit should be part of the price [the profit
belongs to the purchaser], since the slave is a piece of property
belonging to his owner, and if the slave should die, his price
would be a loss to him who had purchased him. So the profit
belongs to the purchaser because it was earned when the slave

was in his possession and under his responsibility. We hold
[by analogy] the same opinion about the fruit of palm trees;
the milk, wool, and young of cattle; the children of a slavewoman; and anything that may be produced while in the
possession and responsibility of the purchaser, including the
[right of] intercourse with a slave-woman who is a thayyib,
and the use of her service.
593. [Shafi'i] said: Some of our fellow jurists as well as
others have disagreed with us on this matter.
One of them held: The profit, the service,13 and the property
of male and female slaves, except the right of intercourse,
belong to the purchaser, who has the right to return [the
female slave] if he discovers any defect in her. He added:
He has no right to return the female slave if he enters into
sexual intercourse with her even if she were a thayyib. Nor
is he entitled to the fruit of palm trees or the milk and wool
of cattle, or the children of slave-women, for all of these—the
cattle, the children of the slave-woman, the palm trees, and
the profit—are not in the category of the. slave.
594. Shafi‘1 said:14 I asked one of those who held this
opinion: Do you not agree that the two [i. e„ the slave and
the profit, etc.] belong together in that both were produced
while in the possession of the purchaser and there was no
stipulation concerning them in the sale transaction?
595. He replied: Yes, but the two must be distinguished
because the fruit which the purchaser has received from the
palm, the children he has received from the female slave, and
the young he has gained from the cattle have been produced
by them, while the slave's profit does not accrue [directly]
from him but results from his employment.
596. [Shafi'I] asked: If a critic raises an objection in line
with your reasoning and says: Since the Prophet decided that
the profit belongs to him who bears responsibility, and since
the profit cannot be earned except by employment and this
might deprive the master of the slave’s service, do you not

agree that the master is entitled to the slave’s profit in lieu
of the service rendered [to the employer] and the expenses for
the [slave’s] subsistence? But if a gift is given to him [the
slave], which cannot divert him from his master’s service, it
should not be given to the second but to the first owner.
597. He replied: No, it should be to the second, in whose
possession the slave was when the gift was given.
598. [Shafi‘1] said: But [the gift] is not a profit, for it falls
in a category other than that of profit.
599. He said: Although it is not, neither can it be con­
sidered [to have been produced] by the slave.
600. [Shafii] said: Its meaning must be distinguished from
that of profit, for it belongs to a different category.
3521
601. He said: Although it falls in a different category, it
was given [to the slave] while he was in the possession of the
purchaser.
602. [Shafi'i] said: T he fruit and the other products were
produced while their [sources] were in the possession of the
purchaser. So if the fruit were picked from the palm tree it
should no longer remain a part of the tree and might be sold
without it just as the tree might be sold without the fruit.
The same [reasoning] applies to the product of the cattle.
However, the profit [from the slave] would more appropriately
be returned with the slave, because sometimes it seems to
acquire a quality which the fruit of the date palm has, if it
were permissible that one of the two should be returned.
* Some of our followers have agreed with us on [retention of]
the profit and on the [permissibility of] sexual intercourse
with the thayyib [slave-woman] and on keeping the fruit of
the palm trees; but they have disagreed on [the right to retain]
the children of the slave woman.
Since all of them have been produced while [the property
was] in the possession of the purchaser, they fall in the same S522
category and no other [opinion] is right; for the slave’s master—
the purchaser-can claim only the [slave’s] profit and his ser­
vice, but not what was given to him as a gift, nor what he may
find, nor anything that he may obtain from a [hidden] treasure

or the like—except in the form of profit or service rendered—
nor the fruit of palm trees, nor the milk of the cattle nor any*
thing else, for all of them do not fall in [the category of] profit.
605.
Shafi‘1 said;15 The Apostle of God has prohibited [the
exchange of] gold for gold, date for date, wheat for wheat,
and barley for barley unless in equal quantities and delivered
immediately.18
Since the Prophet excluded (with regard to these kinds of
edibles, concerning which men were so greedy that they sold S523
them by measure) two categories; one, that a thing should
be sold for an equal quantity with one a cash sale and the
other with deferred payment; and the second, that one of the
things might be more than the other when delivered by hand,
so whatever is in these categories is unlawful, by analogy. Such
kinds are all edibles when sold by weight, for all have the
common attribute that they are edible and potable, since the
latter’s meaning falls within the former’s. To the public, these
materials [foodstuffs] are either basic food or plentiful or both.
I have found that when such foodstuffs (as honey, clarified
butter, olive oil, sugar, and other [foodstuffs] which are edible
and potable) become scarce, men sell them by weight, for
weighing is more accurate than measuring and its meaning is
included in measuring.
604. Someone may ask; Is it possible that the thing sold by
weight is analogous to the thing sold by gold and silver in
weight, so that things exchangeable by weight would be more S 524
appropriate for analogy than things exchanged by measure?
605. [Shafi‘1 said]; T o this it may be replied: T hat which
prevented us from taking the position you have described,
which confines the analogy of things that are weighed to other
things that are weighed, is that valid analogy occurs when you
make one thing analogous to another in decisions in which
one case would be the same as the other. If you were to make
honey and clarified butter analogous to dinars (gold coins)
and dirhams (silver coins) and were only declaring the

superiority of some things over others to be illegal when they
are of one kind, on the analogy of gold and silver coins, then
would it be proper for honey and clarified butter to be bought
for cash with gold and silver coins on [the same basis as a
transaction including] payment at an appointed time?
606. If he says: It [the sale] should be permitted in ac­
cordance with that which the Muslims permitted.
607. [Shaft*! said]: T he reply to this may be: The permissi­
bility of the Muslims indicated to me that they did not do so
by analogy. If it were by analogy, the decision in one case
would be the same as in the other. So it would not be legal
unless [the thing] were sold for ready money, just as gold and
silver coins may not be exchanged except for ready money.
608. Should he ask: If analogy were applied on the basis
of measuring, would you apply the same rules?
609. [Shaft*!] replied: T hat is correct; I make no distinction
under any circumstances.
610. He asked: Is it not permissible for you to purchase a
mudd [a measure]17 of wheat, delivered on the spot, for three
ratis [measures] 18 of olive oil to be delivered at an appointed
time?
611. [Shaft*!] replied: This is not permissible, for nothing
edible or potable can be [exchanged lawfully] for other kinds
of things to be delivered at an appointed time.19 For the rule
of [exchanging] foodstuffs by measure applies to [exchanging]
foodstuffs by weight.
612. He asked: What is your opinion about the [exchange
of gold] dinars for [silver] dirhams?
613. [Shaft*!] replied: T h at is unlawful in itself. Edible
[things] are not analogous to it, for they are not in the same
category. The [exchange of] measured edibles- is not lawful

in itself; only the analogy of what is equivalent in measure
or weight applies to it, because they fall in the same category.
614. He asked: What is the difference between the [ex­
change of] dinars for dirhams?
615. [Shaft'!] replied: I know of no scholar who disagrees
on the permissibility of exchanging foodstuffs by measure or
by weight for dinars and dirhams to be delivered at an ap­
pointed time, but [such an exchange] would be unlawful if
it is made by [gold] dinars for [silver] dirhams. Nor do I know
any scholar who denies that if I discover a mine and pay the
right [tax] on my profit from it, I should each year pay its S527
zakat (legal alms) if the silver or the gold from it remains a
year [or more] with me. And if I were to harvest grain from
my land, having paid its kharaj (land-tax), and it remained
with me for a year, there would be no zakat due from me for
it. And if I were to destroy something belonging to a man, its
value might be paid in gold or silver coins, because they are
the [measure of] prices of all the property of a Muslim, except
in cases of blood-money [which may be paid in camels].
616. He said: That is correct.
617. [Shaft1!] said: Thus things differ by [differentials] less B72
than what 1 have described to you.
618. [Shaft'!] said:30 We have found that it was generally
agreed among scholars that the Prophet decreed that [the
diya] for unintentional homicide committed by a free Muslim
against another shall be one hundred camels to be paid by the
'aqila.21 It is also generally agreed that the [diya] shall be
[paid]-within three years, one-third each year on the basis of
specified years. Several meanings of analogical deduction are
implied in this [decree]; some of them which I may remember
are the following:
We have found that it was generally agreed among scholars
that if a free Muslim commits an intentional offence against
the life or limb of a person or destroys his property, the com*° Bulaq ed., p. 73.

pensation shall be paid out oC his own property; but if the
offence were unintentional, it shall be paid by his ‘aqila.
We have found them [the scholars] agreed that the ‘aqila
pays one-third of the diya for an offence [in the category] of
injuries and upwards. But they have disagreed on the pay­
ment of less than one-third [of the diya]. Some of our fellow
jurists held: The ‘aqila should pay compensation for almuwaddiha 22 and upwards, [equal to] half of the one-tenth
[of the diya] ahd upwards; but he should not pay for injuries
less than that.23
I have said to some of those who stipulate the payment of
half of the one-tenth but not anything less: Can analogy ever
be sound on the basis of the sunna but in one of two forms? $529
619. He asked: W hat are they?
620. [Shaft'!] replied: First, since the Prophet decreed that
the diya shall be paid by the 'aqila, I should follow his ruling;
anything less than the diya should be paid out of the offender's
property. No other analogy can be applied on the basis of the
diya, for in principle it should be more appropriate for the
offender than for the others to pay the compensation for his
offence, just as in the case of intentional injuries. Since God
has decreed that whoever commits an unintentional killing
shall pay the diya and set free one slave, 1 hold that the slave
shall be paid out of the [offender's] property—since the offence
is his—, but the diya would be excluded on the basis of the
[Prophet's] ruling. On the basis of this ruling I hold that
anything less than the diya should be paid out of the [offen­
der's] property, since it is more appropriate for him to pay
than for others, just as I hold that the wiping of the shoes is
permitted on the strength of a tradition from the Prophet,
without regarding it as a precedent for analogy. [Secondly],
S530
analogy may take another form.
621. He asked: What is it?
622. [ShafH] replied: Since the Prophet has excluded unin** Al-muwaddiha is a category of an offence involving a wound reaching
to the bone.
sa This is the doctrine of the Hanaf! school of law.

tentional offence, against life from offences other than those
involving life [i. e., the limb] and from intentional offence
against life, requiring the ‘aqila to pay [the diya] for the unin­
tentional offence because it is the greater amount, I hold that
the ‘aqila shall be liable to pay for what is less [than the diya]
in an unintentional offence, since it is more appropriate for
him to pay it than the greater amount or what falls in that
category.
623. He said: This is the more appropriate m'eaning as a
basis for analogy, but it is not a case parallel to the wiping
of the shoes.
624. [Shafi'I] said: That is in agreement with your opinion,
for the scholars are agreed that the ‘aqila should pay one-third
or more [of the diya]; and their agreement is an evidence that
they applied the analogy of the payment of compensation of
what is less than the diya on the [basis of the] payment of
[full] diya.
625. He said: That is right.
626. [Shafi‘1] said: Our master [Malik b. Anas] said: “ The
best opinion that I have heard is that the ‘aqila should pay
one-third of the diya upward,” and he said that this is the
opinion acceptable to him.24 Do you not agree that a critic
might advance two points [against such an opinion]?
627. He asked: What are they?
628. [Shafi'I] replied: You and I are agreed that the ‘aqila
should pay one-third or more of the diya; but we are in dis­
agreement on the payment of the smaller amount. So the
proof is established by your agreement and mine on the pay­
ment of the one-third, but you are unable to produce a tradi­
tion in support of the payment of the smaller amount. What
would be your answer?
629. He replied: I should say this: My agreement [with
you] is based on a ground different from your agreement [with
me], for my agreement is based on the analogy that since the
‘aqila pays the greater amount [of the diya] he should also be
responsible for a smaller amount. For who has limited the

amount to one-third? Do you not agree that someone mightargue: “ The [*aqila] should pay nine-tenths [of the diya]
rather than the smaller amount? ”
630. [Shaft*!] said: If he holds that one-third [of the diya]
is too much for whomever pays it, I hold [likewise] that it is
too much and that it should be paid by some one jointly with S53 2
him or on his behalf, but no one else should pay it if it were
the smaller amount.
631. He said: Do you not agree that if some one possesses
only two dirhams it would be too much for him to pay onethird [of the diya] and one dirham—since he would thus be
deprived of his property—but that it would not be too much
for one who possesses a fortune to pay one-third [of the diya]?
632. [Shaft*!] said: Do you not agree that he [Malik] would
not say, “ This is our practice,” unless the matter had been
agreed upon among the scholars in Madina?
S533
633. He said: Is not an opinion agreed upon in Madina
stronger than a narrative related by one individual? F or23
why should he relate to us a weak narrative related by one
individual and refrain from relating to us a stronger and
binding matter agreed upon [among the scholars]?
634. [Shaft*!] asked: Supposing someone should tell you: It
is because the narrative is rare and the agreement [about the
matter] is too well known to be related; and should you your­
self say: This is a matter agreed upon?
635. He replied: Neither I nor any of the scholars would
say: “ This is [a matter] agreed upon,” unless it were [a matter]
about which you would never find a scholar who would not
repeat it to you and relate it from a predecessor, such as that
the noon-prayer has four [cycles, rak'as] and that wine is for- 8534
bidden, and the like. I sometimes find one who says: " The
matter is agreed upon,” but I often find scholars in Madina
who say the opposite, and I find that the majority [of scholars]
of other cities oppose what is said to be “ agreed upon.” 26

636. [Shafi'I] said: I pointed out to him that he [the critic]
might object to your opinion: “ No blood-money [should be
paid] for less than al-muwaddifra>” just as he objected to the
payment of the one-third [of the diya].
637. He replied: The evidence for that is that the Apostle
made no decision on cases relating to [offences] less than
al-muwaddiha.
638. [Shaft*!] asked: Do you not agree that a critic may raise
an objection by saying: “ I will make no decision relating to
injuries less than al-muwaddd?a>because the Apostle made no
decisions on such matters."
639. He replied: He has no right to say so, for if [the
Apostle] made no decision on such matters, it does not follow
that he waived the payment of compensation for such injuries.
640. [Shaft*!] said: He may also hold that if he [the Prophet]
did not order the ‘aqila to pay blood-money for offences less
than al-muwaddiha he did not prohibit the ‘aqila from paying
the blood-money for less than al-muwaddiha; for if he had
made a decision [relating to compensation paid by the *aqila]
for al-muwaddiha, but not for offences less than that, it does
not follow that the ‘Sqila should not pay compensation for
offences less than al-muwaddiha [on the ground] that if it
pays the greater compensation it must pay the smaller one,
just as you and I have already agreed on this matter when
you raised an objection to us. If it is permissible for you to
hold such an opinion, it would be permissible to hold it
against you also.
If the Prophet made a decision that the 'aqila should pay
half of the one-tenth [of the compensation for al-muwaddiha],
would it be permissible to hold that [the ‘aqila] should pay
either half of the one-tenth [of the diya] or the [full] diya,
but not an amount between the two, for this should be paid
by the offender! This is an opinion that it is not permissible
for anyone to hold, nor should one hold that the 'aqila should
pay compensation for all unintentional offences, even if it were
only one dirham.
641. [Shaft*!] said: Some of our fellow jurists held: If a free

man commits an unintentional offence against a slave resulting
either in the latter’s death or in an injury less than death, S53s
the [compensation] shall be paid out of the offender’s property—
not by the ‘aqila—for the ‘aqila is under no obligation to pay
the compensation for a slave.
We maintain that this is an offence committed by a freeman.
For since the Apostle decreed that the compensation paid by
the ‘aqila covers an offence committed by a freeman uninten­
tionally, [the freeman’s] offence against a slave, if it were unin­
tentional, must be included [in the Prophet’s decree]. But
God knows best!
You [the interlocutor] have already agreed with us [on this
matter], and have held that he who holds that the ‘aqila is
not liable to pay compensation for a slave holds that no com­
pensation shall be paid by the ‘aqila for an offence committed
by the slave, for the slave himself should be responsible for it,
not his master. Thus you have held an opinion similar to
ours and have regarded our argument, based on the sunna,
as valid.
642. He replied: T hat is right.
S557
643. [Shafi'i] said: I have added: Your fellow jurist[s] as
well as some of our fellow jurists held: Compensation for an
offence committed against a slave is [equal to] the slave’s price
just as the compensation for an offence committed by a free­
man is [equal to] his diya. Thus [the compensation] for the
loss of an eye is half of the slave’s price and for al-muwa^ifra
half of the one-tenth of his price.57 However, you have dis­
agreed with us on this matter and have held that the [com­
pensation] for the slave’s offence is less than his price.
644. He replied: First, let me ask you to give the proof for
the opinion that the [compensation] for the slave’s offence is
[analogous to] the diya. Is it based on a narrative or on an
analogy?
645. [Shafi‘1] replied: It is on a narrative from Sa'id b, alMusayyib.
646. He asked: Will you relate it?

647.
[Shafi’i] replied: Sufyan [b. ’Uyayna] told us trom Ibn
Shihab al-Zuhri from Sa*Id b. al-Musayyib, who said: “ The
blood-money of the slave is [equal to] his price," and I have
heard it repeated by him [al-Musayyib] several times. He may
have added: “ just as [the compensation] for an offence com­ S 558
mitted by a freeman is [equal to] the diya.” Ibn Shihab said:
Others have added: “ [The price of the slave] shall be esti­
mated in the same manner as that of a commodity." 28
64S. He asked: I have asked you to relate a [binding] narra­
tive [i. e., a ♦radition] in support of your argument.
649. [Shnfi‘1] replied: I have already said that I know of no
narrative from an authority earlier than Sa’id b. al-Musayyib.
650. He said: His [Ibn al-Musayyib’s] opinion is not a
proof.
651. [Shafi’i] said: 28 I have not claimed that it is a proof
to be rejected.
652. He asked: What is the proof?
653. [Shafi‘1] replied: It is an analogy [based on the case]
of the criminal offence committed by a freeman.
654. He said: [The compensation for the slave] differs from
the diya of the freeman, because the latter is specified, while S 539
the former is equal to his price, just as commodities—such as
camels, beasts and the like—are priced.
655. [Shafi'I] replied: This argument, in support of those
who hold that the ’aqila should not pay compensation for the
slave, is against you.
656. He asked: In what way?
657. [Shafi’I] replied: One may say to you: Why do you
hold that the ‘aqila pays the slave’s price [as compensation],
if the offence is committed by a freeman who is in possession
of the price, while if the offence is committed against a camel,
the compensation should be paid out of the offender's property?
658. He said: Because it is unlawful to take the [slave's]
life.

660. He replied: Not in the same [degree] as that of a
believer.
661. [Shaft*!] asked: One may argue that the slave’s life is
not of the same [degree of] unlawfulness as that of the free- S54q
man. He added: If it is, should the *aqila pay the blood-money?
662. He replied: Yes.
663. [Shaft*!], asked: [Is not] God's judgment concerning
the unintentional killing of a believer that a diya should be
paid and a slave freed?
664. He replied: T hat is right.
665. [Shaft*!] asked: Do you not hold that [the compensa­
tion] for a slave is the freeing of [another] slave equal in
price—as in the case of a freeman—and that the price is like
a diya?
666. He replied: T hat is right.

a freeman [in retaliation] for the killing of a slave?

slave] and the freeman are liable to the same penalty for what­
ever offense they may commit, and that the camel falls in the
same category concerning the payment of compensation that
is equal to its price? On what ground have you based your
opinion that the [compensation for the slave's] offence should
be equal to that for an offence against a camel, putting it in
[the category of] the smaller amount rather than in the cate­
gory of the diya of the freeman? [The slave] and the free man
possess five things in common and differ in one. Would it not
be more appropriate to apply analogy to the [situation in
which the slave and the freeman possess] five points in common
than to the situation in which they possess only one? In fact,
the slave possesses further points in common with the freeman,

[namely,] that whatever is unlawful for the one is unlawful
for the other, and that both are liable to [the same] penalties
and that they are under the [same] obligations concerning the
performance of prayer and the observance of fasting as well
as other duties, while animals are under no such obligations.
672. He said: I hold that the [slave’s] diya should be equal
to his price,
673. {ShafiT} asked: [Since] you hold that a woman's diya is
equal to half that of a man, why should [the compensation
for] offences against her not be equal to her diya, just as [the
compensation for] an offence against a man is equal to his
diya? [Shafi'i] added: If the diya consists of camels [to be paid]
in three years, do you maintain that the camels would be
regarded as a debt? If so, why do you object to the sale of
camels by deferred delivery? And [if you apply analogy], why
do you do so on the basis of diya rather than on the basis of
either the sale agreemeent [of the slave], or the dowry,80 while
you permit the camel to be regarded in all these cases as a
debt? Thus you have [taken a position] contradictory to
analogy as well as to the text of a tradition from the Prophet
to the effect that he had borrowed a camel [the price of which]
was paid later as a debt?

a transaction].

back—a case on diyas well known to you and to us. This
[precedent] is a sunna.

The Prophet borrowed a camel from a certain man. Uponreceiving several 'camels [later] he ordered me to pay back [the

superior. *Give it to him [the man from whom the camel was
borrowed], for the best of men shall have the best in payment

s^
680. He asked: W hat is the narrative which cannot be re­
garded as a basis for analogy?
681. [Shaft'!} replied: Whenever God has established a
textual order for which a qualifying sunna is provided by the
Apostle specifying a certain modifying permission to the ex­
clusion of another, such an order of permission should be
obeyed provided it is not regarded as a precedent for other
orders of permission. The same [reasoning] applies to certain
specifying sunnas which the Apostle may have laid down to
qualify general rules.
682. He asked: For example?
683. [Shaft*!] replied: God has imposed [the duty of] ablu­
tion on all who rise up from sleep to perform the prayer and
said:
When you stand up for the prayer wash your faces and your
hands up to the elbows, and wipe your heads and your feet up
to the ankles [Q. V, 8].

[God] meant that the washing of the feet is included [in the
ablution], just as other limbs are included. But since the
Apostle practised the wiping of the shoes, we should not wipe
by analogy the turban, the veil, or the gloves. Thus the duty
of "washing the limbs is confirmed, while the wiping of the
shoes is permitted only by the Prophet’s order to the exclusion
of wiping other things.8*

tradictory to the Qur’an?
685. [Shaft*!] replied: In no circumstance can the sunna
contradict the Qur’an.
686. He asked: What is the meaning [of this tradition] in
your opinion?
687. [Shaft*!] replied: It means that one should [always]
wash his feet if the shoes were not worn in cleanliness.
688. He asked: Is this [meaning] permissible in the [Arab]
tongue?
689. [Shaft*!] replied: Yes, just as it is permissible for any­
one who has [already] performed the ablution to stand up in
prayer—for it is not, the ablution that is desired—on the
strength of the Apostle’s [precedent] that he performed two
or more prayers with one ablution.53
Also, God said:

S 546

T he thief, male and female, cut off their hands as a recompense
for what they have earned: [an exemplary] chastisement from
God. God is AU-mighty, All-wise [Q. V, 42].

Just as the sunna indicated that God did not mean by
" cutting off ” [a penalty] for ail kinds of thieves, so the Apos­
tle’s sunna indicated that he meant by the prescription of the
wiping of the shoes that he who wears them need not wash
his feet if they were clean.
690. He asked: What are the like examples in the sunna?
691. [Shaft*!] replied: The Apostle prohibited the exchange
of dates for dates except in equal quantities. Asked about the
exchange of fresh dates for dry dates, he inquired: '* Will the
dates lose weight when dry? ” “ Yes,” he was answered; and
he ordered the prohibition of such an exchange. He also pro­
hibited muzabana, an exchange of a known quantity for an
unknown which may include riba. These are examples which
fall in one category. However, [the Prophet] permitted the
sale of *araya for dry dates.*4 So we have permitted [the sale

of] ‘araya on the strength of the [Prophet's] permission, although
it is the exchange of fresh dates for dry dates, and it falls in
the category of muzabana with its conjecturing. Thus we con­
firm all prohibited foodstuffs that are in the same category
as muzabana, whether [sold] by measure or by estimate; but
we have permitted [the sale of] 'araya as an exception on the
basis of his permission, qualifying the general rule of pro­
hibition. Thus neither one of the two traditions is invalidated
by the other, nor are they invalid as a precedent for analogy.
692. He asked: What [possible] explanation would you give
for that?
693. [Shaft'!] replied: There are two possible explanations.
One, is that what [the Prophet] prohibited as a general rule
did not include 'araya; the other is that he may have given
his order of permission after he had given the general rule of
prohibition. In either case,we have to obey his orders, by
accepting as lawful what he regarded as lawful, and as unlaw­
ful what he regarded as unlawful.
694. [Shafi'i] said:85 The Apostle decreed that the diya for
the unintentional killing of a believer is one hundred camels,
to be paid by the ‘aqila. The compensation for intentional
injuries must be distinguished from that for unintentional,
and from wrongs, but the common factor is that a diya shall
be paid.
Since the Prophet decreed that each person must pay com­
pensation out of his own property, not from that of another,
except in case the free Muslim is killed unintentionally, we
hold that the 'aqila should pay [the diya] for the unintentional
killing of a freeman in accordance with the Prophet's decree,
and that for the intentional killing of a freeman a diya must
be paid by the offender out of his own property just as the
penalty for any other offence committed intentionally should
be paid out of his own property. However, the analogy of
compensation for an unintentional offence should not be
applied to compensation for intentional killing.8*

695. Someone may ask: What should be the compensation
paid for offences committed intentionally?
696. [Shaft’!] replied: God said:
And give the women their dowries as a gift [Q. IV, 3].

And JHe said:
Observe the prayer and pay the zakat [Q. II, 40].

And He said:
But if you are prevented, then such offering as may be feasible
[Q- II, 192].

And He said:
For those who say, regarding their wives, ' Be as my mother’s
back/ and then retract what they have said, they shall set free
a slave, before they touch each other [Q. LVIII, 4],

And He said:
If any of you kill it intentionally, let there be compensation,
equal to what he has killed, from his flocks, as two persons of
ju st character am ong you shall decide—an offering to be delivered
at the Ka’ba; or let there be an expiation, the feeding of poor
people, or its equivalent in fasting, so that he may taste the
mischief of his action. God has pardoned what is past, but if
anyone repeats the offence God will take vengeance on him. God
is mighty, taking vengeance [Q. V, 96],

And He said:
The expiation of it [the broken oath] is to feed ten poor persons
with the food you ordinarily serve to your families, or to clothe
them, or to set free a slave; but if anyone finds not the means
let him fast for three days [Q. V, 91].

The Apostle decreed that the owners of property are re­
sponsible for its protection during the day [from damage by
the flocks], but that the responsibility for any damage done
[to the property] during the night rests with the flock’s owners.*1
MMalik, Vol. II, pp. 747-48; Abu Dawud, Vol. Ill, p. 298; Shawkini,
Nayl aUAwtar, Vol. V, pp. 342-44.

328

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

The Book and the sunna—as well as the absence of dis­
agreement among the Muslims—indicate that [compensation]
must be paid by the person [responsible for the damage] in
accordance with the due owing to God which God imposed
on men in ways that bind them, and that no one is responsible
for a damage done by another. Nor is it permissible for a
person to commit an offence for which another would be held
liable, except in the particular case for which the Prophet
laid down a sunna, such as unintentional homicide and unin- sssi
tentional offences against other men.
The analogy of offence against an animal or damage to a
property or the like, which I have already described, indicates
that [compensation] should be paid by the offender, and it is
commonly accepted that the greater [the amount of compensa­
tion] the greater the reason that it should be paid by the
offender. So analogical deduction should not be applied to
cases of the smaller [amount of compensation] while the
greater and the [more] reasonable is abandoned. The com­
pensation for an unintentional killing committed’ by a free­
man against another, or any other unintentional killing or
offence, should be paid by the ‘aqila on the basis of both
tradition and analogy.
697- Shafi'i said: 38 The Apostle decreed that the compen­
sation for foeticide is a ghurra (a male or female slave).
Scholars have estimated the price of the ghurra to be five
camels.39
698.
[Shafi'i] said: Since nothing has been related from the
Apostle distinguishing between the compensation for male
and female foeticide, it is taken for granted that he had put
them on an equal footing; if the foetus dies after abortion the $552
compensation dor the male is one hundred camels, and for
the female fifty.
But it is not permissible to apply the analogy of foeticide
to other cases [the compensation for which is] specific and in
which a distinction is made between the female and male.
** Bulaq ed.. p. 76.
** Sec paragraph 427; above.

shafiT s R isd la

329

Men do not disagree that if the foetus dies after abortion com­
pensation must be full, namely, that it should be one hundred
camels for the male and fifty for the female. The Muslims
are agreed—as far as 1 know—that if a man causes the death
of another none of them should be held liable to pay any
diya or fine, and the [compensation for] foeticide should be
paid [in like manner], whether dead or alive.
Since the Apostle made a distinction in his decision between
the dead and the living, which was unknown before, other
decisions should be taken on the strength of, and in obedience
to, the Apostle’s order.
699. He asked: Do you know of any possible explanation
for that?
700. [Shaft*!] replied: I know of one, but God knows bestl
701. He asked: What is it?
702. [Shaft'!] replied: If [the child] were not known to be
alive—thus it would be neither necessary to pray for it nor
could one inherit from it—the offence would be regarded as
being against its mother and the Apostle specified [a com­
pensation] the price of which the Muslims fixed, just as he
specified [the compensation] for al-muwad(jiha.
703. He said: That is one explanation,
704. [Shaft*!] said: Another one is that the tradition does
not make it dear that the decision was made in favor [of the
plaintiff]; therefore it would not be right to hold that such a
decision was made [in favor of the plaintiff]. But if one holds
that a decision was taken, it must be in favor of the wife not
the husband (i. e., the mother, not the father) since if any
offence was committed, it was against her. However, there is
no decision to the effect that the child can be inherited from,
for he who does not inherit cannot be inherited from.
705. He said: This is a sound opinion.
706. [Shaft'!] said: God knows bestl
707. He asked: If this is not the [right] explanation what
else should the decree mean?
708. [Shafii] replied: It is a sunna binding on men on the
strength of which they should make decisions.

8553

709. [He asked]: W hat should the other [i. e., analogy] be
which the narrative indicates is a reason on the strength of
which a decision may be made?
710. [Shafi'i] replied: It is the binding decision of a sunna
the meaning of which is known and on the strength of which
analogy may be applied in like situations.
711. He asked; Give an example other than what you
stated, which you may remember, illustrating how analogy
may or may not be applied.
712. [Shafi'i] replied: The Apostle decreed in [the case of]
the mu$arrat40—the she-camel and sheep and goats which the
buyer has milked after the purchase—that he can either keep
it or return it with one sa* (a measure) of dates.41 He also
decreed that “ the profit (al-kharaj) belongs to him who bears
responsibility.” 42
As to “ the profit belongs to him who bears responsibility,”
in the event a slave is bought42 and a profit is derived from
his employment, it would be reasonable that when a defect is
discovered [the buyer] has the right to return the slave without
the profit for two reasons. First, since [the slave] was not in
the possession of the seller, he [the latter] should not have a
share in the profit. Second, [the slave] was in my possession
apd the responsibility was transferred from the seller to me,
so that if the slave died the loss would be borne by me. Thus
if I decide to keep the slave, the profit belongs to me.
On the strength of the tradition “ the profit beltings to him
who bears responsibility ” I hold that anything accruing from
the fruits of an estate that I have purchased, the young pro­
duced by the flock and the children of a slave-woman bom
Al-mujarrSt is the animal which the vendor consciously does not
milk for some time before the sale so that its yield of milk will be greater
after the sale. T he buyer soon discovers the trick of the vendor. See
Muzani, quoting Shaft"! on th e meaning of al-musarrat, in Mukhtajar
{K ita b a l 'U m m , Vo!. II, pp. 184-85, margin).
41 Bukhari, Vol. II, pp. 26-27: Abu Dawud, Vol. Ill, p; 270; Shawkanl,

after her purchase, should be regarded as a profit, because all
of them were produced or born after they have become the
possession of the buyer, not the vendor.
Our opinion concerning the mu$arrat is based on the Apos­
tle's order, but this case should not be [a precedent] for analogy,
because the sale transaction was made for a specific sheep
carrying an unknown quantity of milk and at a specific price,
and we know that [the prices of] the milk of the sheep and
the she-camel vary. However, since the Apostle fixed [the price
of] the unknown quantity of the milk to be one §a‘ of dates,
we accept his decision [as an exceptional order],
713. [Shafi'i] said: If a man buys a sheep which he, after
milking her, decides to keep even though it turns out to be a
musarrat, but after a month he finds another hidden defect
in addition to the ta$riya [for which he decides to return her],
he has the right to do so, and the milk belongs to him, because
it is in the category of profit (kharaj) and was not included
in the sale transaction, but was produced when the animal
was in the possession of the purchaser; but he must give one
$a* of dates for the milk which was in the musarrat [at the
time of the sale], on the strength of the Prophet’s decision.
Thus our opinion on [the price of] the milk of the mu?arrat
is based on a tradition, but the ownership of the milk accruing
after tasriya is determined by an analogy based on [the Prophet's
ruling]: “ The profit belongs to him who bears responsibility."
For the ta$riya milk must be distinguished from the milk that
accrued later, since the former was included in the sale trans­
action, while the latter accrued after the buyer had taken
possession [of the sheep]; it should not [therefore] be included
in the sale transaction.44
714. Someone may ask: Is it possible that for one question
two answers might be given?
715. [Shafi'i] replied: Yes, if it includes two or more dif­
ferent reasons.
716. He asked: Will you giye another example?

[Shaft*!] replied: A woman, upon hearing of the death
of her husband waits for the period of the ‘idda and marries
another man, but her [former] husband returns.45 Separation
[between the woman and her second husband] shall take place
on the basis of the cancellation of the second marriage with­
out resort to divorce and neither one shall be held liable for
punishment. The woman has the right to keep the brideprice, but she has to wait for the period of the 'idda [before
she joins her former husband]. The child [if any] belongs to
his father. Neither the woman nor the [second] husband can
inherit from one another.
A decision in his [the second husband's] favor—since in the
explicit sense [the marriage] is lawful—gives the woman the
right to keep the bride-price, to wait for the ‘idda, the child
[the right] to belong to his father, and waives the punish­
ment. A decision against him [the second husband]—since in
the implicit sense it is unlawful—-invalidates the marriage [con­
tract], forbids intercourse with her after [the two spouses] have
known [about the first husband], prohibits inheritance between
them, and separation takes place without divorce since she
was not a lawful wife.
There are many other parallel situations, such as the mar­

the other.
720. He asked: What is prohibited disagreement?
721. [Shafi'i] replied: On all matters concerning which God
provided clear textual evidence in His Book or [a sunna]
uttered by the Prophet’s tongue, disagreement among those to
whom these [texts] are known is unlawful. As to matters that
are liable to different interpretations or derived from analogy,
so that he who interprets or applies analogy arrives at a decision
different from that arrived at by another, I do not hold that
[disagreement] of this kind constitutes such strictness as that

And He said:

Thus [God] disapproved of [people's] disagreeing on matters
concerning which they have been provided with dear [textual]
evidence. As to matters which shall be decided by ijtihad,
I have already given you examples such as the qibla, testi­
mony, and the like.

which our predecessors have disagreed in their transmission
and concerning which God has provided a textual command
[in His Book] liable to different interpretations. Is there any

725. [Shaft*!] replied: Few are the matters on which they
have disagreed and concerning which we have found no evi­
dence in the Book of God or the sunna of His Apostle, or an
analogical deduction based on both or on one of them.
726. He said: Give some examples.
727. [Shaft*!] replied: God said:

‘A'isha said: The [term] aqra’ or “ periods ” [means] purity;
those who agreed with her in this meaning include Zayd b.
Thabit, Ibn 'Umar and others.8 However, some of the Com­
panions of the Prophet held that aqra* [means] menstruation,
so that the divorced woman cannot lawfully [remarry] until
she performs the washing after the third menstruation.4
728. He said: On what ground has each based his opinion?
729. [Shaft*!] replied: The common meaning of aqra' [in
the foregoing narratives] is periods, and the periods in this
case are signs indicating to the divorced women that they are
not allowed to remarry until these periods have been com* See ShSfi-I, Kit&b al-Umm, Vol. V, 191-92; Bayhaqi, Sunan al-Kubra,

pleted. But, in our opinion, those who held that aqra’ means
menstruation believe that [God] said that these periods con­
stitute the minimum [time-limits], because such periods sepa­
rate one [menstruation] from another, just as limits are the
minimums that separate things from each other. Since [the
period of] menstruation is shorter than that of purity, it is
more appropriate to speak of it as a period, just as the new
moon marks the period of division between one month and
another. He [who held this opinion] has perhaps based it on
the Prophet's order that the women taken captives at Awtas 8
should wait one menstrual period before indulging in inter­
course.® So he concluded that the *idda constituted an istibra’,7’
and that the istibra* was one menstrual period. He also made
a distinction between the istibra’ of slave and free women and
held that the istibra’ of the free woman followed three full
menstrual periods after which she attains the state of purity,
while the istibra* of the slave-woman was achieved after one
full menstrual period after which she attained purity.
730. He said: This is one school of thought; but why have
you accepted a different one, since you hold that the Quranic
communication is capable of two interpretations?
731. [Shafi’a] replied: The new moon, which marks [the
beginning of] a period of time, is a sign provided by God to
indicate the months; but the period marked by the new moon
is different from the [time defined by the] day and the night,
since it is the sum of either twenty-nine or thirty just as the
numbers thirty or twenty are totals of other numbers and
have no other meaning.8 So if the [term] “ period ” (qur*)
means time, it consists of a number of nights and days just
as the ’idda consists of a number of nights and days of men­
struation and purity. Thus a period Tesembles limits, which

may or may not be included within the thing bounded by the
limits and not clearly distinguished. So [qur’} means period
in a [special] sense.
732. He asked: What is that sense?
733. [Shaft*!] replied: Menstruation means the visible dis­
charge of blood by the womb, while purity means that the
womb retains the blood so that it is no longer apparent. [Both]
purity and qur’ refer to the retention—not the discharge—of
blood; therefore, since purity might refer to a period of time,
it is more appropriate to use it in the meaning of qur’; because
it refers to the retention of the blood. Thus when *Abd-Allah
b. *Umar divorced his wife during her menstruation, the Apos­
tle commanded 'Umar b. al-Khat^ab to order him to keep her
until she achieved her state of purity, after which he could
divorce her while she was in that state without entering into
sexual intercourse with her. “ This is the [period of the] *idda,
during which God has decreed that woman can be divorced,”
said the Apostle.*
734. Shaft*! said:10 This means that God said: “ When you
divorce women, divorce them during their 'idda ” [Q. LXV, 1].
The Apostle handed down God’s word that the [term] *idda
refers to [the state of] purity, not menstruation.11 For God
said: “ [Women should wait for] three periods.” So a divorced'
woman must wait for three periods; if the third period is
prolonged, it is not lawful [for her to remarry]' until she has
menstruated again. If it is feared that she might not [men­
struate] again, she must wait for [the prescribed] months of
the ‘idda. Thus the washing [after the third menstruation] has
no significance, since it is a fourth consideration apart from
the other three. He who holds that it is obligatory for her
would be holding that if a woman remained a year or more
without v/ashing it would not be lawful for her to remarry.
Thus the opinion of him who holds that aqra’means [periods

of] purity, is closer to the meaning of the Book of God, and
the language is clear as to the meanings of these words. But
God knows best!
735. Shaft*! said: 12 The Prophet's order that the istibra* of
the female captive should be one menstrual period means just
what it says [i. e., in the literal sense]; for if a slave woman
completed a full and genuine menstrual period following a
state of purity, she obviously is not pregnant. Even though
blood might appear, it would not [necessarily] constitute a
true menstrual period, for the latter is valid [only] when it
has been completed. Therefore any period of purity that has
preceded the full and valid menstruation is to be regarded as
free of pregnancy in the literal sense.
Women who are observing the 'idda do so for two reasons:
T o accomplish the istibra* [in the sense of clearance from
pregnancy] and for a purpose other than this. When she
accomplishes [in the sense of fulfilling the waiting period], she
fulfils two menstrual periods and two [periods of] purity and
[ends with] a third [period of] purity. If the purpose were
.[merely] istibra* [in the sense of clearance from pregnancy]
she would have repeated the performance of this istibra* twice;
but in addition to clearance from pregnancy there is also an
obligatory [istibra*, i. e., that provided in the Book of God].
736. He asked: Will you cite for me other similar [cases]
in which scholars have disagreed?
737. [Shaft*!] replied: Yes, and perhaps we can give some
clearer examples. We have already partially adumbrated this
subject in our discussion of the sunnas concerning which
.transmitters disagree, which has a bearing on the questions
you have asked as well as similar matters.1*

And He said:
As for your women who have despaired of [further] menstrua­
tion, if you are in doubt, their period shall be three months, and
those who have not menstruated as yet. And those who are preg­
nant, their term is when they are delivered of what they bear
[Q. LXV, 4]:

S57,

And He said:
Those of you who die, leaving wives, they shall wait by them­
selves four months and ten [days] [Q. II, 234].
Some of the Companions of the Apostle said: Concerning
divorced women, God prescribed that the [period of the] ‘idda
of those who are pregnant should be [until] they are delivered;
but those whose husbands have died "should observe an ‘idda
of four months and ten [days]. So the 'idda of the widow who
is pregnant must be four months and ten [days], even if she
has been delivered, so that she fulfils two ‘iddas, since delivery
itself does not mean the termination of the prescribed ‘idda
save in the case of divorce.15 They hold in effect that delivery
is acquittance, while the [waiting for] four months and ten
[days] is obligatory, and that the widow cannot [lawfully]
remarry until the four months and ten days are completed.16
They believe that she is under obligation in two senses, and
that neither one can be waived. It is as if she were subject
to the claims of two men, neither one of whom invalidated
the other, or if she married [one of them] during the ‘idda
and had intercourse with him, she would have to fulfil an ‘idda
before she could marry the other one.
O ther17 Companions of the Apostle have held that if she
[the widow] has been delivered, it is lawful for her to remarry
even if her [dead] husband is not yet buried.18

739. Shafii said: Thus the Quranic communication can be
interpreted in two ways at the same time, but the most reasona*
ble literal one is that a state of pregnancy puts an end to
the ‘idda.
740. [Shaft*!] said: The sunna of the Apostle indicates that
delivery marks the end of the *idda in the event of the death
[of the husband], just as in the case of divorce. [For] Sufyan
[b. ‘Uyayna] has told us from al*Zuhrf from ‘Ubayd-Allah b.
•Abd-Allah [b. ‘Utba] from his father, [who related] that a few
nights after the death of $ubay*a al-Aslamiya’s husband, she
was delivered. When Abu al-Sanabil b. Ba'kak, who was passing
by, saw her, he remarked: “ You have already prepared your­
self for remarriage! You still have four months and ten [days]
to wait." So Subay'a reported this to the Apostle, who said:
“ Abu al-Sanabil is not telling the truth ” (or it is not as Abu
al-Sanabil said) “ You are already lawful, so remarry.” 19
741. He said: A person whose words are in conflict with
the sunna has no proof. So give examples of disagreement
concerning which no sunna is to be found, but concerning
which there may be either textual or inferred evidence in the
Qur’an, or evidence based on analogical deduction.
742. [Shaft*!] replied: God said:
For those who set aside their women, their women must wait
four months; if they revert, God is All-forgiving, All-compas­
sionate. But if they resolve on divorce, then verily God is All­
hearing, All-knowing [Q. II, 226-227].
T he majority of the Companions of the Prophet who related
from him have said that they believed that when the [period
of] four months has expired, he who has set aside his wife
must make a decision either to go back to her or to divorce
her.20 Other Companions are reported to have said that the
intent to divorce [the wife] is indicated by the expiration of

the four months.21 However, we do not possess anything on
this matter from the Apostle of God.
743. He asked: Which of the two opinions have you
accepted?
744. [Shafi'i] replied: I hold that the divorce is not binding
on him who has put his wife aside, and that if his wife claims
her due [i. e., payment of the deferred bride:price] from him,
I should not hold him liable for it until the four months had
expired. When the four months had expired, I should tell
him either to take her back or to divorce her. His taking her
back is [indicated] by intercourse.
745. He asked: Why do you prefer this opinion over the
opposite one?
746. [Shafi'i] replied: Because I consider it more consistent
with the meaning of the Book of God and with what is
reasonable.
747. He asked: Where is the evidence for it in the Book
of God?
748. [Shafi'i] replied: In God’s saying: “ For those who set
their women aside is a wait of four months ” [Q. II, 226], the
literal meaning is that he upon whom God for some reason
has imposed [the obligation] to wait for four months is bound
to wait until the four months expire.
749. He said: It is possible that God may have given him
four months in which to take her back, just as you may say
{to someone]: “ I have given you four more months in which
to finish building this house."
750. [Shafi'i] replied: No one to whom this statement had
been made would imagine that it meant such a thing unless
it had been stipulated during the course of the conversation,
for if he [the owner of the house] says: " I have given you four
months," it means that he has given him four additional
months and that he has no claim again.t him unless the four
months have elapsed and the house still is not finished. He

bul, 1333/1915), Vol. II, p. 83. The Hanafi school supports this point of
view. Cf. Tabari^ Tafslr, Vol. IV, pp. 456-99.

[the builder] cannot be accused of failing to complete the
house, or of being late in completing it so long as any part
of the four months remains unexpired. If the four months
have completely expired [and the builder has not completed
the house], he can be charged with being in default, and there
may well be an indication before the expiration of the four
months that the house cannot be completed by the time the
four months are over.
However, there is no indication in the [act of] taking a wife
back that one cannot do so before the expiration of the four
months, because the performance of intercourse may take only
a twinkling of an eye. So if the, person, as I have explained,
keeps himself apart from his wife until the four months expire,
and then continues to keep himself apart, then he is answera­
ble to God, for he should either take her back or divorce her.
If there had not been any indication in the latter part of the
communication that its meaning never differed from what you
held, we should have preferred the first interpretation for
reasons we have described, since that is the literal meaning.
The Qur’an is to be taken at its literal meaning, unless there
is an indication either in the Q ur^n itself, the sunna, or the
ijma*, that the true meaning is a hidden one, and not the
literal meaning.
751. He asked: What is there in the tenor of the communi­
cation that supports what you have said?
752. [Shaft*!] replied: When God, Glorious and Mighty,
said that those who put their wives aside will have four months,
He added:

S 579

S 580

If they take them back, God is All-Forgiving, All-Compassionate.
But if they resolve on divorce, then verily God is All-Hearing,
All-Knowing [Q. II, 226-227].
So [God] laid down two rulings conjointly and without sepa­
rating them; they must both take effect after the expiration
of the four months, for He gave the husband the choice of
either taking her back or divorce; the choice is simultaneous,
neither one precedes the other. He said that the choice must

*1

JU R IS P R U D E N C E

be made at one time, just as in the case of something pawned
[the lender would say to the owner]: " Redeem it or else I shall
sell it.” The two are inseparable, for in all cases [where there
is a choice] between good actions one has either to choose one
or the other without separating [the two alternatives],
•[As for the contention that] the two alternatives should have
been stated separately [on the ground that] the decision to 879
take the wife back can be taken during the four months while
the decision to divorce her [has to be made] at the end of the
four months, [I should reply that] they are two judgments that
have to be envisaged at the same time, and that one has plenty
of time in which to take one of them but little time in which
to decide on the other.
8 551
753. He asked; If he takes her back before the expiration
of the four months, do you hold that it is [a valid act]?
754. [Shafi'i] replied: Yes, it is, just as you would say that
if you paid a debt before it was due, you would be quit of it,
and you would be doing a good act in paying it of your own
free will before you were required to.
755. [Shafi'i] asked: Do you hold that it would be wrong
if every day he resolved to take her back but did not have
intercourse with her until the four months had expired?
756. He replied: The determination to take her back is not
consequential until he actually does so, and his taking her
back is [accomplished only by the performance of] intercourse,
if he is capable of it.
757. [Shafi'i] asked: If he performs intercourse without the
intent to take her back, is he thereby freed from the obliga­
tion to divorce her, since that is the significance of intercourse?
758. He said: Yes.
759. [Shafi'i] asked: Likewise, if he were determined not to
take her back and swore daily that he would not take her
back, but then had intercourse with her for a moment before
the expiration of the four months, would he no longer be
bound to divorce her, even though the intercourse did mean
-that he intended to take her back?
760. He replied: Yes.

v

s h a f i T s Ri sal a

761. [Shaft*!] asked: Is not his resolve not to take her back
thereby invalidated? And if he has intercourse with her for
pleasure and not because he intends to take her back, does
this not, in our opinion and yours, prevent him from escaping
from his obligation to divorce her?
762. He replied: It is as you said, for by having intercourse
with her he gives up the right to divorce her, regardless of the
reason for the performance of the intercourse.
763. [Shaft*!] asked: How could he resolve daily to take her
back and then at the end of the fourth month be obliged to
divorce her, even though he had not determined to do so and
had not spoken of it? Do you consider that such an opinion
would be regarded as reasonable by anyone?
764. He replied: What makes it lacking in reasonableness?
765. [Shaft*!] asked: If a man says to his wife " By God
I shall never approach you/’ do you think that it is as if he
says: “ You are divorced for four months? ”
766. He replied: Supposing I should say yes?
767. [Shaft*!] asked: What if he had intercourse with her
before [the end of] the four months?
768. He replied: No, it would not be the same as saying:
“ You are divorced for four months/'
769. [Shaft*!] said: Thus the pronouncement of the.oath of
putting aside is not a [pronouncement of] divorce, but merely
an oath that is transformed into divorce after a certain period
of time. Is it permissible for any person who comprehends
what he is talking about to say such a thing, unless it is based
on a binding narrative?
770. He replied: Such an argument is against you.
771. [Shaft*!] asked: How?
772. He replied: You hold that if the period of four months
expires, he [who has put his wife aside] has either to take her
back or is compelled to divorce her.
773. [Shaft*!] said; The oath of putting her aside does not
constitute divorce, but is an oath for which God specified a
period during which He forbade the husband to harm her.
He imposed on him the obligation either to take her back or

3583

8 534

344

ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE

to divorce her, and the decision had to be made after the
expiration of four months from the time he put her aside.
But the period of the effectiveness of this injunction is tem­
porary, for it compels the person concerned whichever of the
two alternatives he wishes—to take her back or to divorce her.
If he refuses to do either, he who has the power to do so is
to take from what he can; i. eMhe shall be divorced from her
since it is not lawful for him to cohabit with her.
774. Shafi'I said: 22 They [the scholars] are disagreed on
[the distribution] of inheritance. Zayd b. Thabit and his
followers held that each heir should be given his designated
share; if any surplus remains and the deceased has no agnate
(<asaba) n relative or patron,-* it goes to the Muslim com­
munity. Others have held that the residue should be given to
the uterine relatives (dhawi al-arham). If a man is survived
by [only] one sister, she inherits half of his estate and the
other half is to be given to her.
775. Someone has asked: Why would you not give the
residue of the estate [to the survivors]?
776. [Shaft*!] replied: Because of certain indications in the
Book of God.
777. He asked: Where is the indication in the Book of God
in support of your opinion?
778. [Shafi'I] replied: God said:
If a man passes away and has no children, but he has a sister,
she shall receive a half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if
she has no children [Q. IV, 175].

And He said:
If there be both brothers and sisters, the male shall receive the
portion of two females [ibid.].

Thus [God] prescribed that if the sister is the only survivor,

Succession by contract (Wala’) is an arrangement between one person
and another that the one can inherit the other in case of death of one

she is to receive half [of the estate of the deceased person];
if the brother is the only survivor, he is to receive the entire
estate. And He prescribed that if both brothers and sisters
survive the deceased, the sister’s portion shall be half the
brother’s. His [God’s] decree concerning the sister’s portion,
whether she is the sole survivor or survivor with a brother,
is the same, [namely] that she is not on an equal footing with
the brother, but receives only half of what he is entitled to
receive of the inheritance. Thus if you hold that [in the event]
a man dies leaving a sister as [the sole] survivor and she
receives half the estate by inheritance and the other half as a
residue, have you not given her the entire estate as a sole
survivor, while God prescribed for her only half of it whether
she was alone or with others?
779. He replied: I should not give her the other half as an
inheritance but as a residue [in the absence of other survivors].
780. [Shaft*!] said: What is the, meaning of giving her [a
residue]? Is this a matter on which you can exercise istihsan
(discretion) and give it to whomever you wish so that you
may give it to the [deceased’s] neighbors or to one of his dis­
tant relatives? Is that for you to decide?
781. He replied: No, that is not for the discretion of the
judge, but I would give it to her [as a residue] on the grounds
of her uterine relationship.
782. [Shaft*! asked]: Would it be as an inheritance?
783. He replied: Supposing I should say yes?
784. [Shaft*!] said: You would then have let her inherit
what God did not.25
785. He said: I hold such an opinion on the strength of.
God's saying:
Those who are uteiine relatives are nearer to each other in the
view of the Book of God [Q. VIII, 76],

786. [Shaft*!] said: [The Quranic communication]: " Those
who are uterine relatives are nearer to one another" was
revealed at a time when men were [first] entitled to inherit
,s See Shafi’i, Kitdb al-Umm, Vol. IV, pp. 6-7.

from one another on the basis of succession by contract, then
on the basis of the Islamic faith and the hijra [emigration]
so that one emigrant was entitled to inherit from another
while his heirs who did not emigrate [to Madina], notwithstanding their closer blood relationship, could not inherit.
So the communication: " Those who are related, etc." was
revealed [to regulate inheritance] in accordance with what
[God] prescribed for them.2*
787. He asked., What is the evidence for that?
788. [Shafi'I] teplied: [The communication]: "Those who
are uterine relatives are nearer to one another " is the rule
[of inheritance] in accordance nvith what [God] prescribed.
Do you not agree that some of “ those who are uterine rela­
tives " inherit while others do not? The husband [who is not
related in blood] receives a larger share than most of those
who are uterine relatives. So if you permit people to inherit
according to uterine relationship, the daughter would be on
an equal footing with the brother, and all the uterine heirs
would be entitled to inherit and would have a greater claim
than the husband, who enjoys no uterine relationship. If the
meaning of the communication were as you have described it,
you would have objected to our position with respect to it,
namely, that neither his sister, who is more closely related to
him, nor his mawlas get all of the estate; half is given to his
sister and half to his mawlas, even though they are not uterine
relatives and the Book of God does not prescribe any share
for them.27
789. Shafi'I said: 23 They [the scholars] have also disagreed
on the grandfather's [share of inheritance]. Zayd b. Thabit,
supported by *Umar [b. al-Khattab], 'Uthman [b. *Affan], ‘All
[b. Abi Tahb] and Ibn Mas’ud, held that the [deceased’s]
brothers can inherit along with his grandfather. Abu Bakr

Allah b. 'Utba, hold that the grandfather is on an equal
footing with the father, and they eliminate the brothers.4*
790. He asked: On what ground have you fixed the inheri­
tance of the brothers on the same level with that of the grand­
father? Is it on the strength of the Book of God or the sunna?
791. [Shafi'I] replied: I do not know of any explicit text
in the Book of God or the sunna.
792. He said: The narratives are equally divided on the
subject and the evidence of analogy supports those who held
that [the grandfather] is on an equal footing with the father
and that the brothers are debarred.80
793. [Shafi'I] asked: What is the evidence?
794. He replied: I consider it to lie in the binding title of
“ fatherhood," in your [the scholars’] agreement that because
of it you debar the mother's near relatives, and in your agree­
ment that his [minimum share] is one-sixth; all of this is the
ruling that applies to the father.
795. [ShafiiJ said: We do not believe that he should inherit
only on the ground of his fatherhood.
796. He asked: Why?
797. [Shafi'I] replied: Because I might find that although
the title of fatherhood applies [in his case] he could not inherit.
798. He asked: In what instance?
799. [Shafi'I] replied: If there were another father sur­
viving—and the title of fatherhood applies to him [the grand­
father] and so on back to Adam—the grandfather could not
inherit. Moreover, if he were a slave, a disbeliever, or a mur­
derer,'he could not inherit. Thus, if it were only on the
ground of fatherhood, he would inherit in all these instances.
Our opinion that the grandfather debars the mother’s near
relatives is based on a narrative, not on the title of fatherhood.
For we hold that the son’s female descendants in the male
line, no matter how small the share to which they are entitled,
debar the mother’s near relatives. As to [your argument that]
the grandfather's share cannot be less than one-sixth, we hold
**Cf. Malik, Vol. II, pp. 510-12.

that this is applicable to the grandmother also.*1 In doing so
we have followed a [logical] sequence, and we do not believe
that if the rule applicable to the grandfather resembles that
applicable to the father in certain respects, it does so in all
respects. For if the latter were true, similar to those of the
grandfather, the son’s female descendants would enjoy rights
and they would debar the mother's near relatives. The rule
applicable to the grandmother is similar to that governing
the grandfather in that we should not make her share less S 593
than one-sixth.
800. He asked: W hat is your argument for rejecting our
opinion that the grandfather debars the [deceased's] brothers
from inheritance?
801. [Shafil] replied: Because it is far removed from ana­
logical deduction.
<
802. He said: We thought that it was indeed [a valid] ana-^
logical deduction.
803. [Shafil] replied: Do you think that the grandfather
and the brother each claims to be related to the deceased or
is it to someone else?
804. He asked: What do you mean?
805. [Shaft*!] replied: Is the grandfather's [relationship]
not based’on his claim: “ I am the father of the father of the
deceased person " while the brother says: “ I am the son of the
deceased’s father.”
806. He said: T hat is right.
807. [Shaft*!] asked: Does not each claim his relationship
to the father in accordance with his own position in that
relationship?

809. [Shaft*!] asked: Supposing that the deceased person
were the father, and his successors were his son and his father;
what would each inherit from him?

the estate] and the father's one-sixth.
811. [Shaft*!] replied: If, as you said, the son of the deceased

is entitled to inherit a greater portion of the estate than is
the father of the deceased and since the claim of the deceased’s
brother is based on his relationship through the deceased's
father, [just as] the deceased’s grandfather’s claim is based on
his relationship through the [deceased’s] father, then why do
you hold that the brother is debarred by the grandfather? If
one of the two is to be debarred by the other, it is the grand­
father who should be debarred by the brother, since the latter
is entitled to a greater portion of the estate than* is he [the
grandfather] to whom the two [the father and the brother]
both claim to be related? Otherwise, we should never allot
the brother five-sixths [of the estate] and the grandfather
one-sixth.
812. He asked: What prevents you from holding such an
opinion?
813. [Shafi‘1] replied: All those [scholars] who disagree [on
matters concerning inheritance] are in agreement that the
grandfather [as a joint successor] with the brother is entitled
to an equal or greater share than the brother. On this matter
I am in full agreement with them without having recourse to
analogy, siqce analogy is the common basis of all their rulings.
I have taken the position that the brothers’ right to inherit
on a par with the grandfather is the more appropriate ruling
in view of the evidence provided by analogy, which I have
explained, as well as the opinion of the majority of jurists,
ancient and modern. In addition, the brother’s inheritance
is firmly fixed by the [text of the] Book, while that of the
grandfather is not. Furthermore, the sunna establishes the
brother's inheritance more [clearly] than the grandfather's.
814. He asked: I have heard your views on consensus and
analogy, in addition to your opinions concerning the decrees
of the Book of God and the sunna of the Apostle. What is
your position concerning the opinions of the Apostle’s Com­
panions, if they disagree?
815. [ShafH] replied: We accept those which agree with the
Book, the sunna, consensus, or which is soundest according to
[the rules of] analogy.

816. He asked: What of the opinions of a single Com­
panion, on which neither the agreement nor the disagreement
of others is known: Would you seek evidence for accepting
it in the Book, or a sunna, or a ruling that people in general
have accepted so that such evidence constitutes what you call
a narrative?
817. [Shaft*!] replied: We have not found anything con­
cerning this matter in the Book or in any established sunna,
but we have found that scholars accept the opinion of one of
their number at one occasion and reject it on another. They
also differ concerning some of the opinions which they accept
from such a person.
818. He asked: Which one would you accept?
819. [Shafi'I] replied: I would accept the opinion [of a
Companion] if I did not find anything about it in the Book,
or established sunna or consensus, or anything of similar
meaning that would decisively support it* or any analogical
deduction. But one seldom finds an opinfon of one Com­
panion that is not contradicted by another.52
820. He asked: You have [rightly] made decisions on the
basis of the Book and the sunna; on what ground have you
made decisions on the basis of consensus and analogy, placing
them on an equal footing with a [text in the] Book and a
sunna?
821. [Shaft*!] replied: Although I have made decisions [on
the basis of consensus and analogy] just as I have made de­
cisions on the basis of the Book and the sunna, [in the case of
consensus and analogy] the principle on which I made my
decision varies.
822. He asked: Can there be different bases for the same
decision?
823. [Shaft*!] replied: Yes; we make decisions on the basis
of the [text of the] Book and the generally accepted sunna,
concerning which there is no disagreement, and we maintain
that therefore such decisions are right according to both the
explicit and the implicit [meaning of these sources]. We also
**Cf. J. Schacht, Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence, p. 19.

s h a f iT s

R isa la

make decisions on the basis of a single-individual tradition on
which there is no general agreement, and we hold that we
have made the decision correctly according to its explicit
meaning, since it is possible that he who related the tradition
may have made an error in it.
We also make decisions on the basis of consensus and analogy,
although the latter is the weaker of the two instruments.**
Analogy is used only in case of necessity, since it is not lawful
if a tradition exists, just as performing the ritual ablution with
sand s* renders one pure when one is travelling and there is
no water; but it does not render one pure if water is available,
it produces a state of purity only if water is not at hand.
Similarly, a source other than the sunna can be used as the
basis for a decision if there is no sunna. However, I have
already discussed analogy and other sources [of the law] *8
824. He asked: Will you give an example?
825. [ShafH] replied: I should make a decision against a
person either on the basis of my knowledge that the accusa­
tion made against him was right, or on his [own] admission.
If I neither had the knowledge or if he did not confess, I
should decide against him on the basis of [the testimony of]
two witnesses [of just character]. Since witnesses may make
mistakes or be confused, my knowledge and the [defendant’s]
admission would be stronger [evidence] against him than the
[testimony of] two witnesses. I should [also] decide against
him on the strength of [the testimony of] one witness and the
[plaintiff’s] oath; but [such evidence] is weaker than the [testi­
mony of] two witnesses. I should also decide against him if
he refused to take an oath whereas the plaintiff did take an
oath; but [such evidence] is weaker than the [testimony of]
** Shaykh Shakir maintains that the word “ weak '* qualifies both con­
sensus and analogy—which is unlikely—and argues that since Shafil held
that the consensus of the people is authoritative, his reference must be
to the consensus of the scholars. Cf. Shakir's ed., p. 599. note 10.
*4Tayammum is ablution by sand during travel instead of by water.
Sand as a substitute for water is lawful for fulfilling the duty of ablution
if water is scarce or unavailable during travel.

one witness and the oath, since the accused’s refusal might
have been the result of his fear for his reputation or his feeling
that the matter was too insignificant for an oath, whereas he
who did swear an oath on his own behalf might be a covetous
or debauched person.

The end.
