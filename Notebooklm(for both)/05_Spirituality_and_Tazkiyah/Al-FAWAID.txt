Translator's Notes

All praise and thanks are due to Allah. We praise Him and seek
His help, guidance and forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allah
from the consequences of our evil conduct and the sins we
have committed. Whosoever Allah guides, no one can mislead
and whosoever He sends astray, no one can guide.

| bear witness that there is no god but Allah Alone, who has no
partner and | bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and
Messenger. Allah sent him (peace be upon him) as a witness, a
bearer of good news and a warner, and as one who invites to
Allah by His leave, and as a lamp spreading light.

This book, Al-Fawédid: A Collection of Wise Sayings is one of
the well-known compilations of Imam Shams Ad-Din Ibn
Qayyim Ai-Jawziyyah, who is well known by the name Ibn AI-
Qayyim (may Allah have mercy upon him). This blessed book is
not like others that simply contain sections, chapters and
themes, but it consists of the elevated thoughts that Allah,
Exalted be He, bestows upon some of His servants as He wills.
So whenever any of these scattered pearls of wisdom occurred
to the Imam, he would immediately record them. | am sure that
he did not sit down and write this book in one or two weeks, but
surely it was developed over a long period of time. Whenever
something came to his mind, he would record it, and whenever
he learnt a lesson or anything crucial in his life, he would
illuminate the lines of his page with the ink of his pen.

| remember the first time | read this book, which was twenty
years ago in 1980. It was beyond my ability at that time to fully

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * xv

comprehend the meaning that Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah have
mercy upon him) was trying to impart in the book. However, in
the course of time, Allah, the Almighty bestowed His favors
upon me, and | began to understand the light and guidance
that these words contain.

The book is not concerned with juristic subjects nor does it
deal with any of the instrumental sciences that anyone can
understand and memorize, but rather, it consists of the
landmarks of guidance, and light, and the firebrands of piety
that ‏مما‎ Al-Qayyim pondered in the fields of piety, asceticism
and vivid exhortation toward the truth.

He focuses on the role and duty of the hearts, and makes them
clear to us to the extent that we are moved and motivated to
learn and practice them. He explains to us the diseases of the
heart so that we may know how to avoid and overcome them.
He ponders on the depths of the nature of the human self and
moves inside its hidden sphere, from one part to the other,
which might be difficult for many people to understand. This
book has reached the peak of understanding regarding this
particular point. Ibn Al-Qayyim is renowned in the field of
ascetics and one of the most knowledgeable people of Allah.

So, dear reader, here is the book. Take it as one of your close
friends, and when you find life’s difficulties facing you, read it
and ponder the meaning that is applicable to you. Surely, you
will find your way out, for you will be living in the world of
insight, where there is permanent comfort, the yearning to be
close to the Lord of the worlds and the strong desire to enter
the Gardens of Delight.

We ask Allah, the Exalted, to bestow upon our hearts that which
He bestows upon His righteous servants, and reward Imam Ibn
Al-Qayyim and the Muslims with the best reward, and gather
us with him at the place of His mercy along with the Prophets,,

Sahih Al-Bukhary, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawdd, etc.

The translation process of this book took a great effort from all
members of the team.

We would like to express our thanks to everyone who took part
or contributed to the reproduction of this translation, particularly
the translators, the revisers and the editor. May Allah reward
them all for their work and make it helpful for those who seek
guidance to the True Path.

Finally, we pray that this translation will provide useful
information and advice to all its readers, regardless of their
background, and that they may all benefit from it. We also hope
that all our efforts on this book will be counted among Our good
deeds with Allah, the Almighty. Amen.

In the Name of Allah

Imam and sheikh Abu ‘Abdullah is known as lbn Qaiyim Al-
Jawziyyah (may Allah be merciful to him). He revived the
Sunnah and restrained innovation. He said what follows:

Important Rules: Conditions One must Meet in
Order to Benefit from the Qur'an

lf you want to benefit from the Qur'an, you must concentrate
and devote your heart solely when reciting and listening to it.
You must pay attention, and try to comprehend the fact that
what you are reading is the word of Allah. As you read, you
must know that Allah is addressing you in and through this
Qur'an. Indeed, it is the words of Allah to you through the
tongue of His Messenger. Allah says,

3 إن فى ‎US‏ أِحرّى لِمَن ‎OF‏ لَه قب أو ‎jay A Al‏ سَّهِيدُ 4

which means, "Verily, therein is indeed a reminder for him who
has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful." (Qaf, 50:37)

Obtaining the perfect effect depends upon the stimulus, the
place of the receiver, the condition for the effect to occur, and
the absence of any obstacle that may obstruct the effect. The
above verse explains all that in the most precise, and clear
words. When Allah says which means, "Verily, therein is
indeed a reminder" it is a sign for what had passed from the
beginning of the chapter until this verse. His saying, “for him
who has a heart" refers to the place of the receiver and it
means the living heart, which comprehends what Allah says.
For example when Allah says,

AS OF ‏من‎ jad 3 sabe > ‏مين‎ OTE Nits ‏...إن‎ «
2 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

which means, "This is only a Reminder and a plain Qur'an. That
he or it (Muhammad or the Qur'an) may give warning to him
who is living (a healthy minded believer)." (Yasin, 36:69-70)

“Who is living." means the one who has a living heart. And
when Allah says which means, "Or gives ear" means the
person listens to what is being said to him. And this is the
condition in order to be truly affected by the words.

And His saying, "While he is heedful..." means to be aware;
that his heart is conscious and not distracted by any worldly
matter.

lbn Qutaibah' said, "He is listening to the Book of Allah while
his heart is present and understands; not being inattentive or
unaware. 11 the heart is inattentive; lacking understanding
concerning what is being said, as well as failing to see or
meditate on it, then there is an obstruction. {tf however, the
Qur'an produced an effect on the receiver, which is the living
heart, and the condition of listening was fulfilled, and the heart
is not engaged with something other than the meaning of the
speech, the desired effect will occur, which is obtaining benefit
from the Qur'an and remembrance."

The Living Heart

Some people may say, "If the effect will take place by the
combination of these matters, what is the purpose of the article
‘or in ’Or gives ear’ while it is the article ‘and,’ which joins two
matters and not ‘or,’ which indicates only one. To this, it can
be said, "This is a good question and the answer is as follows:

"Ibn Qutaibah is ‘Abdullah bin Muslim bin Qutaibah Ad-Daintry. He is one of
the chiefs of literature and has produced many works. He was born in
Baghdad in 213 A.H. He settled down in KGfah, and was appointed as the
judge of Ad-Daindr and attributed to it. He (may Allah be merciful to him)
passed away in Baghdad 276 A.H. From among his works are Al-Ma arif,
Adab Al-Katib, Al-Ma‘aly, and Ta'wil Mukhtalif Al-Qur’an. See Al-Bidayah wa
An-Nihayah, vol.11, p.61.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

"The speech includes the article ‘or’ because it considers the
case of the one being addressed and called. Many people
have a naturally living heart and so whenever he thinks and
meditates, his heart and mind will lead him to the truth of the
Qur'an, and his heart will believe in what the Qur'an has said.
And here the passing of the Qur'an over his heart will only
increase his natural light. This is the description of those, about
whom Allah says,

§ وَيرى الذدين اوتوا ‎at‏ الذى انزل إليلك من ‎SS‏ هو الحق ...2 4

which means, “And those who have been given knowledge see
that what is revealed to you (O Muhammad) from your Lord is
the truth." (Saba’', 34:6)

And He, the Almighty says about them,

it a lamp, the lamp is in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant

This is the natural light of the pious heart that recognizes the
light and beauty of the Divine light contained in the truth of the
Qu’ran, and this is the state of the owner of a living heart that is
aware.

Ibn Al-Qaiyim said, "We have mentioned some of the lessons
contained in this verse in the Book ljtima’ Al-Juydsh  Al-
Islamiyah ‘ala Ghazw Al-Mu'atilah wa Al-Jahmiyah. The owner
of the heart combines his own heart and the meanings of the
Qur'an. He finds that it is as if it was written in his heart and he
reads and comprehends it with his heart. Many people do not
possess a perfectly prepared and aware heart, namely a
completely living heart. Such a heart needs a witness to
distinguish between right and wrong. The life of his heart; his
light, and his natural brightness do not reach the level of the
owner Of a living and aware heart. The way to lead him to this
guidance is to dedicate his hearing to the words of the Qu’ran
and his heart to think, meditate, and comprehend its meaning.
He will then know that it is the truth.

One: The state of he who sees with his own eyes what is he is
being called to and told about.

Two: The state of he who knows the truthfulness and piety of
he who is informing him and says, "His truthfulness is enough
for me." Such is the level of Faith while the first is the level of
Ihsan. The first reaches ‘Assured Knowledge’ and his heart is
promoted to the rank of the ‘Assured eye’ while the other has
definite belief, which rescued him from disbelief and enabled
him to enter into Islam.

The Assured eye is of two kinds: one in this worldly life and the
other in the hereafter. The one, which is found in this life is
attributed to the heart, like an eye witness. Whatever the
Messenger told us about unseen matters, will be seen in the
hereafter with our own eyes and in this life such things will be
‘seen’ by insight.

Chapter: The Beginning of Creation, Resurrection
and the Principles of Monotheism Mentioned in
Chapter Qaf

This chapter mentions many principles of faith that are
sufficient for us, and that serve us instead of the speech and
opinions of people, and their reasoning. It contains information
about the beginning of creation, resurrection, monotheism,
prophethood, belief in Angels, division of people into miserable
conditions and happy ones. It also includes the attributes of
Allah, and talks about Allah in a way that depicts Him as being
free from all defects and faults. Allan also mentions the two
resurrections and the two worlds: the bigger world is the
Hereafter and the smaller world is this worldly life. He
mentions the creation of mankind, death, and resurrection,
and his state both in death and on the Day of Resurrection.
Allah Knows all that the servant does, even what he conceals
within himself. Allah appoints guardian Angels that record
every word that is uttered. , He will come on the Day of
Resurrection accompanied by an ange! to drive him and an
angel to bear witness. When the angel drives him along he will
say what Allah says,

لكرو” يالا ع لسن كم م عم ‎ee‏

which means, "Here is (this Record) ready with me." (Qaf,
50:23)

which means, “O Allah! Here is what You ordered me to bring.
Then it will be said when he is brought to Allah, what Allah
says,

ok

( dane ‏فى جهم كل كفار‎ ail «

6 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

which means, "Both of you throw (Order from Allah to the two
angels) into Heil, every stubborn disbeliever (in the Oneness of
Allah, in His Messengers, etc.)." (Qaf, 50:24)

This is what is usually done when a criminal is brought into the
presence of the King. It would be said, "This is so and so. |
have brought him." And the King would say, "Take him to jail!
Punish him with what he deserves!"

The Resurrection is for the Body itself

This chapter clearly shows that Allah, the Exalted returns the
same body that had obeyed or disobeyed Him in life, in order
to reward or punish it just like He rewards the soul itself, which
believes in Him and punishes the one, which disbelieves in
Him. That does not mean that Allah, the Exalted creates
another soul, which will be rewarded or punished, as some
people say. Such people do not understand the nature of the
Resurrection, which the Messengers informed mankind about.
They claim that Allah, the Exalted will create another body
that is different in all aspects and that Allah will reward or
punish it. They also say that the soul is simply apart of the
body, so Allah will create another soul other than this one and a
body other than this body. This belief is contrary to what the
Messengers taught, and what the Qur'an, Sunnah, and other
Books of Allah, the Exalted say. This is in fact denial of the
Resurrection and adopting the belief of the disbelievers. Such
people find it difficult to comprehend that Allah, the Exalted will
recreate the very same body and soul that had known life.
They cannot imagine how the body will become bones and dust
and Allah will create it again in its original form. Allah quotes
them as saying,

- 3 7% £€ #@ - Le 7 > - 3

which means, "When we are dead and have become dust and
bones, shall we (then) verily be resurrected? (As-Saffat, 37:16)

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7

And such people also say,

وو

+ اهو

which means, " That is a far return." (Qaf, 50:3)

lf what they assert is true and another body other than the one
that had known in life is rewarded or punished, this will neither
be Resurrection nor returning back, indeed, it would be a new
creation altogether. And the following verse would be rendered
meaningless. May Allah forbid! Allah says,

Jas 7, sok? Az ie mor 7%

which means, "We know that which the earth takes of them
(their dead bodies)." (Qaf, 50:4)

Allah answered the question that He, the Exalted will separate
these pieces which had mixed with the earth and turned it into
elements which are difficult to be separated. So Allah, the
Exalted told mankind that He knows what the earth is taking
from their flesh, bones, and hair and just as He knows these
pieces He is capable of separating, and gathering them after
being separated, and creating them again. He, the Exalted
decides the time of Resurrection by His perfect knowledge,
power, and wisdom.

Those who doubt the resurrection are of three kinds:
The Suspicion of Those Who Deny the Resurrection

One: The body and the earth is mixed in such a way that
prevents any separation or the possibility of separation.

Two: The resurrection is not related to power.

Three: If a generation died and another one is created to take
its place, it is not wisdom to destroy them all and then resurrect
them again.

The Proof of Resurrection

One: Stating the perfection of Allah’s knowledge, as He said
while answering those who said,

اس دهده سمت , ا ‎soo‏ به ع ملعي رت ‎ee,‏
‏# ...من يحي ‎pas)‏ وَهىّ ‎tae‏ 29 قل ‎GS‏ الذى ‎ALS‏ أول ‎Boe‏ وَهوّ ‎BE SR:‏

rotted away and became dust?" Say: (O Muhammad) "He will
give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is
the All-Knower of every creation!" (Yasin, 36:78-79)

And He, the Exalted says,
> J o 3 ‏م و م » 77-7 “ الك‎ a? ara ws" 5

which means, "And the Hour is surely coming, so overlook (O
Muhammad), their faults with gracious forgiveness. [This was
before the ordainment of Jihad holy fighting in Allah's Cause].
Verily, your Lord is the All-Knowing Creator." (Al-Hijr, 15:85-86)

And He, the Exalted says,

Two: Stating the perfection of Allah’s power. Allah says,

earth Able to create the like of them? (Yasin, 36:81)

And He, the Exalted says,

which means, “That is because Allah, He is the Truth, and it is

things." (Al-Hajj, 22:6)

Allah, the Exalted combines these two matters when He says,

‏بَلِىْ وَهوّ الْخَلقُ‎ nee GE ‏على أن‎ ge GeV SAA GE ‏أوَلِيسَ الذى‎ >

And He, the Exalted says,

SY SLUTS Les ‏ينا لا ُرْجعُونَ و‎ Kh oe jaa sly

(without any purpose), and that you would not be brought back
to Us?" So Exalted be Allah, the True King." (Al-Mu'mindn,

shall hold them equal with those who believe (in the Oneness of
Allah Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, in
their present life and after their death? Worst is the judgment
that they make." (Al-Jathiyah, 45:21)

The resurrection is a reality. It is known by the mind that Allah
is perfect His names, and attributes obligate this matter and
Allah is in no need of those who deny this truth, and His
perfection is free from any defects or faults.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 11

Allah, the Exalted told mankind that whoever disbelieves, is
confused but that they did not gain anything from _ this
confusion. Allah says,

م د اس

‎rs - ~% 9 4:‏
...فهم فى امرٍ مريج 4

‎which means, "so they are in a confused state (cannot
differentiate between right and wrong)." (Qaf, 50:5)

‎Then in this chapter, Allah invited them to consider the
heavens: the way they have been built, their height,
straightness, and beauty, and then to look at the earth and
how He spread it out, prepared it for its purposes, fixed it with
mountains, and provided all the means of life. He produces
every good kind of plant with their different shapes, colors,
amounts, benefits, and qualities. This indeed provides an
insight and a reminder for every servant who turns to Allah,
(that is to say, who believes in Allan, obeys His commands,
and always begs for His forgiveness). If he ponders on this, he
will perceive the meaning, which the Messengers told us about
concerning Monotheism and the Resurrection. Whoever looks
at the heavens and the earth will firstly meditate and secondly
remember, and this will provide deeper insight to the servant
who always turns to Allah with his body, heart and soul.

‎Allah then invited them to think about the source of their
subsistence; food, clothing, ships, and gardens. The source is
water, which Allah sends down from the sky and blessed it until
He produces therewith gardens and grain, different kinds of
fruit: black, white, red, yellow, sweet, and sour. Allan shows the
difference in their use and kinds, and He also snows the grain
and its use, qualities, shapes, and amounts. He then mentions
the palm trees as they contain a lesson and meaning, which
will not be left a secret for the one who meditates. Allah, the
Almighty says,

12 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

4 720... GH ‏به الأرض بَعْدَ‎ 3
which means, "And makes the earth alive therewith after its
death." (Al-Baqarah, 2:164)

Then He, the Almighty says,

which means, "Thus will be the resurrection (of the dead)." (Qaf,
50:11)

It means that just as plants, fruit, and grain are brought out from
the earth, you will be resurrected from the earth after naving
been mixed with it.

We have mentioned this analogy and examples of other
analogies mentioned in the Qur'an in the Book entitled ‏للم‎
‎Ma‘alim, and we explained some of their lessons.

Then Allah determines  prophethood using the best of
determinations, the most concise words, and far removed from
all suspicion and doubt. He informed mankind that He sent
Messengers to the people of Ndh (Noah, peace be upon him),
‘Ad, Thamdd, the people of Lit (Lot, peace be upon him), and
the people of Fir'awn (pharaoh), but they disbelieved in them.
So He destroyed them with different kinds of destruction and He
proved the truth of what the Messengers had promised them.
This is proof of their prophethood and the prophethood of he
who informed us about them. This is the prophet who had
neither learnt from a teacher nor read from a book. He
informed us about it in detail exactly like the people of the Book.
Nothing refutes this except the question of those liars who deny
the final resurrection. Whoever asks this question is a liar and
such is the one who denies what has been proven and what
has been passed down through the generations by the
prophets and those who follow in their footsteps. Denying such

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 13
a matter is like denying the existence of famous kings,
scientists, and remote countries.
The Meaning of Lethargy:
Allah, the Exalted again mentions the Resurrection. Allah
says, —

ead

which means, "Were We then tired with the first creation?" (Qaf,
50:15)

And He, the Almighty says,
6B. Geile Hi ls...

which means, "And was not wearied by their creation.” (Al-
Ahqaf, 46:33)
And He, the Almighty says,

Boyt ‏ين‎ UE Leg... 3

which means, “And nothing of fatigue touched Us." (Qaf, 50:38)
Then He, the Almighty said,

J
‏م اذه 8 ” تر‎
— “ Z ‏سه‎ ”

which means, "They are in confused doubt about a new
creation (i.e. Resurrection)?" (Qaf, 50:15)

Their point of confusion is that Allah, the Almighty will recreate
mankind as a new creation on the Day of Resurrection. Allah
drew the attention of such people to His greatest proofs of
power, to the evidence of His Divinity. and proof of the

14 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Resurrection, as it is among the greatest proofs of
Monotheism.

There is no greater evidence than the formation of this human
being with its organs, abilities, and properties, and the flesh,
bones, veins, nerves, ligaments, openings, systems, desires.
and insight that it contains. All that is simply a drop in the
ocean. The idea of the creation of man is enough to make any
person ponder, and if he does, he will remember what the
Messengers told us about Allah: His names and attributes.
Allah, the Exalted then told mankind that His Knowledge
encompasses humanity and that He, the Exalted knows what
each individual whispers to himself. He informed us that He is
close to man through His knowledge and is close to man like
a vein that is inside his body. Moreover, He is even closer to
him than this vein; He has more power over him and more
knowledge of him.

Our sheikh said, "The meaning of "We" here is the Angels. As
Allah says,

4 Bp 5128 ASU ‏فإِذَا قرآئئه‎ «

which means, "And when We have recited it to you [O
Muhammad through Jibril (Gabriel)], then follow you its (the
Qur'an's) recital." (Al-Qiyamah, 75:18)

50 Gabriel recited it to him. Our sheikh said, "The evidence is
what Allah says,

which means, "That the two receivers (recording angels)
receive (each human being after he or she has attained the age
of puberty)." (Qaf, 50: 17)

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 15

Writing the Deeds of Man and the Two Resurrections

Allah, the Exalted informed us about the two angels that are on
the right and left of each human being and they write his
words and deeds. He paid attention to the process of reckoning
and writing words more than He did with writing deeds, which
are less in amount as actions are the aims of words and their
ultimate ends Then He mentioned the minor resurrection which
is the stupor of death and that it came with the truth which is
meeting with Allah, the Exalted and the soul will be brought to
judgment and will have its reward or punishment which will be
advanced to it before the major Day of Resurrection. Then He
mentioned the major Resurrection as He, the Almighty says,

4D ‏الْوَعِيد‎ HWS reall gets }

which means, "And the Trumpet will be blown, that will be the
Day whereof warning (had been given) (i.e. the Day of
Resurrection)." (Qaf, 50:20)

After that He, the Exalted told us about the states of all
creatures on this Day and that each of them will come to
Allah, the Exalted accompanied by an angel that will drive him
and an angel that will bear witness against him. This is besides
the witness of his limbs, and the earth, which will testify
concerning what he has and the rights he has taken from
others. This includes the rights of Allah, the Exalted, the rights
of the messenger (peace be upon him) and the rights of the
believers. Allah, the Exalted will take the testimony of the
Guardians, the Prophets, the places on which bad deeds were
committed, and the skin and body parts that were used in
committing sins. He, the Exalted will not judge them only
according to His knowledge even though He is the most Just.
That is why He told His Prophet (peace be upon him) that He
judges between people according to what He heard from their
confession as well as evident testimony and not according to

16 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

His knowledge alone. How can any ruler judge according to his
knowledge without neither sign nor confession? Then He, the
Exalted mentioned the heediess state of mankind concerning
this matter while they should not be apathetic at all. Allah, the
Almighty says,

“ 5م بر
‎om Oe eA eG 8 ١‏
‎A 5‏ “ - 0

Pd

which means, "Indeed you were heedless of this." (Qaf, 50:22)
In another verse, He, the Almighty says,

SL oad 22515
Ss 8 5 ‏هُ‎ ٠
4 ‏ور‎ 0 a “oF ‏فى‎ 9 ‘ohn -
“ o

which means, "And indeed they are in grave doubt concerning it
(this Qur'an)." (Haid, 11:110)

The Companion and his Dispute

Then Allah informed us that every human being has a
companion who is constantly with him and that companion is an
angel. This angel writes down his words and deeds, whether
they are good or bad. When the angel brings him to Allah, he
will say, "This is the one that You had appointed me to
accompany in life. | brought him to You." This is the saying of
Mujahid.*

Ibn Qutaibah said, "The meaning is that this is what | have
written and counted from his words and deeds. They are all
recorded here. The verse includes both meanings. That is to
say, this person is the one whom | have been accompanying

* He is Mujahid bin Jabr, Abu Al-Hajaj from Mecca. He is from the followers
and is a scholar of recitation and exposition. He learned exegesis from Ibn
‘Abbas, a famous scholar of this nation. He passed away in 104 A.H. See
Tahdhib At-Tahdhib, vol.1, p.42, Al-Jarh wat-Ta‘dil, vol.8, p.1469, Mizan Al-
I'tidal, vol.3, p.439, Lisdn Al-Mizan, vol.7, p.349, and Siyar Alam An-Nubala’,
vol.4, p.449.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 17

and these are his deeds, which | have counted. Then Allah, the
Almighty will say,

which means, "(And it will be said), "Both of you throw (Order
from Allah to the two angels) into Hell." (Qaf, 50:24)

The order may be referring to the two angels or to the angel
that accompanied him during life, and it is the same. The way
this speech is written is quite famous among the Arabs. Allah
then mentioned six characteristics of the person who would be
thrown into Hellfire:

One: He is a disbeliever in Allah, His rights, His religion,
Monotheism, His Names, His attributes, His Messengers, and
His Angels. He disbelieved in His Books and the Resurrection.

Two: He rejects the truth due to his stubbornness and denial.

Three: He hinders good and that includes both the good that
would be done to him if he performed good deeds and the good
done to other people. There is no good in him neither for
himself nor for his people and this is the state of most
creatures.

Four: Besides hindering good to people, he transgresses
against man with his hand and his tongue. He is unjust and an
oppressor.

Five: He is doubtful, in fact he is suspicious.

Six: Although being a polytheist, wno sets up another god
with Allah, he worships, loves and hates for His sake, swears
by Him, gives oaths to Him, and takes friends and enemies for
His sake. The disbeliever might even quarrel with his
companions from the devils and Satan would accuse him of
wronging himself and that he is the one who pushed himself
to transgress. His companion would say that it never had the

18 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

power to mislead him but he was himself in error and far astray
50 he chose his condition for himself. Allah says that Satan
would say to the people of Hellfire,

- ‏سس‎ ler ‏لس مشو‎ ENG 0 wD ‏سرش سار‎
4 20... J ‏فَاسْتَجَبَثْمَ‎ Nye5 OWN] bal ‏عَلَيكُم من‎ J OF U5... «

which means, "I had no authority over you except that | called
you, SO you responded to me." (Ibrahim, 14:22)

So his companion here is Satan and they are disputing in the
presence of Allah.

Another group said, "His companion here is the Angel. He will
claim that the angel exaggerated in his writing, was unjust, and
that he did not commit all these sins, and that the angel was
quick and did not give him a chance to repent before he wrote.
The Angel would say that he did not add anything in his writing
more than what was really done and that he was not quick to
write. Allah says that Angel would say,

© 220 ‏بعيدر‎ hehe ‏...ولكن كان فى‎ >
which means, "But he was himself in error far astray." (Qaf,

50:27)
Allah, the Almighty would say,

—— rye 4 a ‏م م‎

which means, "Dispute not in front of Me." (Qaf, 50:28)

Allah informed us about the quarrels between the disbelievers
and Satan in His presence in chapter of As-safat and Al-A'raf,
the disputes of people in His presence in chapter Az-Zumar,
and the disputes of people of Hellfire in chapter Ash-Shu'ara'
and Sad.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 19

After that Allah, the Exalted told us that the Punishment He
decrees cannot be changed. This is mentioned in the following
verse,

a FD

. ا 0017 د مهار 7 ‎oF‏ يكن عم > =
« ...لاملان جهنم مِنَ الجنة وَالناس ‎4B) opel‏

٠
oc 3
“

it 1

which means, "Surely, | shall fill Hell with jinns and men all
together." (Hdd, 11:119)

Also His promise to the people of faith to enter Paradise and
this will never be changed or reneged. lbn ‘Abbas said, “He
wants to say that My promise will never be changed either
concerning people who obey Me or those who disobey.”
Mujahid said, "As if He says, "| have executed what | had
decreed." And these are the most correct explanations of this
verse.”

There is another opinion that the meaning is: sayings would
never be changed just because of some lies and false reports,
as often occurs in the presence of kings and rulers. So the
saying here is that of those who dispute with each other. This
is the opinion of Al-Farra® and Ibn Qutaibah.

As Al-Farra' said, "The meaning is that no one will tell lies in the
oresence of Allah as He knows the unseen." And ibn Qutaibah
said, "It means that sayings will never be distorted, increased,
or decreased in Allah’s presence. As he said, "The sayings In
My presence and not My sayings." This is, "Lies will never be
told in My presence." So from this one point the following two
verses bear the same meaning. Allan says,

35 Al-Farra' is Yahya bin Ziyad bin ‘Abdullah bin Mansdr, Abu Zakariyya from
Kufah. He is a scholar of grammar and linguistics. They used to say to him,
"The emir of believers in grammar." He passed away in 207 A.H. See Tahdhib
At-Tahdhib, vol.121, p.212, Al-Ansab, vol.10, p.155, and Tarikh Baghdad,
vol.14, p.149.

which means, "And | am not unjust (to the least) to My slaves."
(Qaf, 50:29)

And He, the Exalted says,

which means, "The Sentence that comes from Me cannot be
changed." (Qaf, 50:29)

That is to say, whatever I said and promised will be done and
it will always be just. From the other point, Allah described
Himself with two things: a

One: sayings would never be changed in Allah's presence as
He has perfect knowledge.

Two: He will never be unjust toward His servants as He is
perfectly just.

Then He told us about the large space in Hellfire and that
whenever people would be thrown inside it, Allah says that it
would say,

7
ft as a ‏دي‎ 2

which means, "Are there anymore (to come)?" (Qaf, 50:30)

He is wrong who says that this verse indicates the negative,
that is to say: that there would be no more to come. Many
authentic hadiths refutes this interpretation.

Attributes of the People of Paradise

Allah told us that Paradise will be brought near the pious
people and that its people have four characteristics:

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 1

One: They are oft-returning to Allah in sincere repentance.
These believers always return to Allah after committing sins
and start to obey and remember Allah. ‘Ubaid bin ‘Umair said,
"The repentant is the one who remembers his sins and asks
forgiveness for them." Mujahid said, "He is the one who asks
forgiveness when he remembers his sins while he is alone. And
Sa'id bin Al-Musaiyab* said, "He is the one who commits sin,
repents, commits again, and repents again.”

Two: They preserve their covenant with Allah. lbn ‘Abbas said,
"Whatever Allah orders him to do, he does it. Qatadah?® said,
"It is he who preserves the rights and blessings granted to him
by Allah." The Soul has two special abilities: the power to ask
and the power to preserve. The repentant person uses his
power of asking to ask forgiveness from Allah, to return to Him,
seek His pleasure and obey Him. The power of preserving is
found in keeping himself away from sins and ail that ts
forbidden. The repentant person comes nearer to Allah by
obeying Him.

Three: Allah, Exalted says,

followers and one of the seven top jurists in Medina. He used to be called the
narrator of ‘Umar because he was the best among people to memorize laws

him) passed away in 94 A.H. See Tahdhib At-Tahdhib, vol.4, p.84, Tarikh Al-

which means, "Who feared the Most Beneficent (Allah) in the
Ghaib (unseen): (i.e. in this worldly life before seeing and
meeting Him)." (Qaf, 50:33)

This verse declares the Existence, Divinity, and Power of Allah
and His knowledge of every detail of His servants’ conditions,
His Books, Messengers, orders and prohibitions, His promise,
threat, and standing before Him on the Day of Resurrection.

Four: Allah, the Almighty says,
4 Bs ‏...وَجَاءَ بقلب‎ «

which means, “And brought a heart turned in repentance (to
Him - and absolutely free from each and every kind of
polytheism)." (Qaf, 50:33)

lbn ‘Abbas said, "He is far from sins and rushes to obey Allah.
The reality of repentance is to devote the heart to obedience,
love, and striving to be near to Allah." Allah then mentioned the
reward of the one, who has these attributes. Allah says,

صل
‎tt 0-1 8 _— 222 we 5 “ “ 2 7 ” “ 3 -‏ “ 8 = _+ ل و م “ ور الله ‎va‏
‏> ادخلوها سلم ‎EU'S‏ يوم الخلود ‎ot CB‏ ما مَشَاءُونَ فيا ‎Gy‏ مزيد 25 #

which means, “Enter you therein in peace and security; this is a
Day of eternal life! There they will have all that they desire, and
We have more (for them, i.e. a glance at the Aimighty, All-
Majestic)." (Qaf, 50:34-35)

Then He frightened them with the destruction that had
happened to those who were before them. Such were stronger
in power but that did not prevent their destruction. And when
the time of destruction came, they ran seeking refuge in the
land! Could they find any place of refuge to save themselves
from destruction? Qatadah said, "The enemies of Allah got into
a tix and found that the order of Allah would catch up with
them." Az-Zajjaj said, "They ran seeking refuge but did not find

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 3

any other way except death.” They searched for any other
refuge other than death but they did not find any.”

Allah, the Exalted informed us about that as He says,
4 27 ‏قلبٌ او القى السّمع وَهوّ شهيد‎ 4d) ‏...لنإكرئ لمن كان‎ ©

which means, "A reminder for him who has a heart or gives ear
while he is heedful." (Qaf, 50:37)

He then told us that He created the heavens and the earth and
all between them in six Days and that nothing of fatigue
touched Him. He accused His enemies from among the Jews
of lying when they said that Allah rested on the seventh day.
Then He ordered His Prophet to follow His example and be
patient toward what his enemies are saying about him, as Allah
was patient toward what the Jews had said about Him. And
there is no one more capable of being patient than Him. He
ordered him to do something that will help him to be patient,
and that is to glorify the Praises of His Lord, before the rising of
the sun and before its setting (i.e. the Fajr, Zhuhr, and ‘Asr
prayers), as well as during a part of the night also, glorify His
praises (i.e. Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers). Likewise there are
more prayers other than the Fard prayers: (As-Sunnah, Nawafil
optional and additional prayers). It was said that after the /sha
prayer is Al-Witr prayer (Odd prayer) and said it means the two
rak'ahs after Maghrib (Sunset Prayer). The first is the opinion of
lon ‘Abbas and the other is of ‘Umar, ‘Aly, Abu Hurairah, and AI-
Hasan bin 'Aly. And there is a third opinion from Ibn ‘Abbas that
it means glorifying Allah verbally after every obligatory prayer.

Then Allah ends the chapter by mentioning the Resurrection
and the call of the caller that indicates the souls returningto their
bodies for Resurrection. This call will be from a near place that
will be heard by all. Allah says,

24 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

{ 2+ ‏دالحة‎ 45.72 in ea ‏رم‎ 8

which means, "The Day when they will hear As-Saihah (shout,
etc.) in truth." (Qaf, 50:42)

It will be the sign of Resurrection and Standing in front of Allah.
On the Day when the earth shall be cleft from off them, 35 with
plants. They will come out hastening forth. That will be a
gathering, quite easy for Allah.

Then Allah, the Exalted said that He knows all the things that
His enemies say about Him, and He will punish them for their
words. He mentions His power and knowledge and that He
will punish them.

He told His Messenger that he is not a tyrant over them and
was not sent to force them to believe. He ordered him to warn
by the Qur'an, he who fears Allah's Threat. The righteous will
benefit from being warned but those who do not believe in the
Resurrection and neither fear His threat nor hope for His
reward, will not benefit from being warned.

The Status of the People of Badr

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to ‘Umar (may Allah be
pleased with him), “Who knows, perhaps Allah has looked at
the warriors of Badr and said (to them), 'Do whatever you like,
for | have forgiven you.”° Many people have misinterpreted this
hadith, for the obvious meaning is that everything has been
allowed for them and that they can do whatever they want. But
this, in fact is not the case. According to a group of people,

° Recorded by Al-Bukhary, in Kitab Al-Jihad was-Siyar, section: the spy, no.
(3007). And Muslim, in the book of Fadail As-Sahabah, section: among the
excellence of the people of Badr (may Allah be pleased with them)... no.
(2494),

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 25

among whom is Ibn Al-Jawzy, ’ “By this statement it does not
mean that their future sins are included, but what is meant is
the past sins. That is to say, “I have forgiven every bad thing
you did before.” He (Ibn Al-Jawzy) said, “and there are two
things that prove that:

If it was supposed to mean future sins, the answer would have
been: | will forgive you.

The second thing is that it would have been a sort of freedom to
commit sins, and there is no reason for that.

The true meaning of this response is: | have forgiven your
previous sins because of this battle. But it is a weak argument
in two ways:

Firstly, because the statement, “Do whatever you like, for | have
forgiven you,” includes future sins and not the past only. And
the statement, “I have forgiven you,” does not necessarily
mean, “I will forgive you” in order to include future sins, for the
Statement “I have forgiven” is a confirmation that there will be
forgiveness in the future, just like the following statements in the
Qur'an which means: “The event (the Hour or the punishment of
the disbelievers and polytheists or the Islamic laws or
commandments) ordained by Allah will come to pass), and that
which means (and your Lord comes) and so on.

Secondly: the hadith itself replies to him, for the cause of it is
the story of Hatib and his spying on the Prophet (peace be upon
him), and that is a sin that was committed after the battle of

” Ibn Al-Jawzy: His full name is, ‘Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Aly bin Muhammad Al-
Jawzy, Al-Qurashiy, Al-Bagdadiy, Abu Al-Faraj, the scholar of history and
hadith of his time. He was born 508 A. H. and died (may Allah have mercy
upon him) 598 A. H. adopted from Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah (vol, 13\ p, 35).

26 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Badr ° and not before it, therefore, the second opinion is
definitely coorect.

Allah knows best, but we think that this is a statement about
people that Allah knew would not leave their religion, and that
they would die in the state of Islam. He also knew that they
might commit some sins like other people do, but He would
not leave them to persist in them, but would make it easy for
them to turn to Him with sincere repentance, seek His
Forgiveness and do righteous deeds that wipe out the trace of
their sins. And this would be specified for them only and not for
others.

This is because their truthfulness has been provenand so they
have been forgiven. It can also be that they were granted
forgiveness because of these reasons, and it does not mean
that they should stop performing religious duties, because of
having been forgiven, and if that had happened without
fulfilling orders, they would not have needed to pray or Fast or
perform Pilgrimage or pay Zakat or do Jihad.

Just because someone is certain to be forgiven, it does not
mean that repentence should be delayed. This point Is
mentioned in another hadith. Abu Hurairah (may Allan be
pleased with him) narrated that, ‘l heard the Prophet (peace be
upon him) saying, "If somebody commits a sin and then says,
‘O my Lord! | have sinned, please forgive me!’ And his Lord
says, 'My slave knows that he has a Lord who forgives sins
and punishes for it, | therefore have forgiven My slave (his
sins).' Then he remains without committing any sin for a while
and then again commits another sin and says, ‘O my Lord, |
have committed another sin, please forgive me,’ and Allah says,
'My slave knows that he has a Lord who forgives sins and
punishes for it, | therefore have forgiven My slave (his sin).

° The statement “Committed after the Battle of Badr:” it occurred six years
after it.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 27

Then he remains without Committing any sin for a while and
then commits another sin (for the third time) and says, ‘O my
Lord, | have committed another sin, please forgive me,' and
Allah says, ‘My slave knows that he has a Lord Who forgives
sins and punishes for it, therefore | have forgiven My slave (his
sin), he can do whatever he likes.” °

This does not mean that the person is allowed to do forbidden
things, but it means that as long as the person repents,
whenever he commits sins, Allah will forgive him.

And the reason this servant has been distinguished with this is
because it is known that he does not insist on a sin, and that
whenever he commits a sin he repents. It is just as certain for
this servant as it is for the people of Badr, as well as anyone
the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) gave the good
news of entering Paradise or told him that his sins had been
forgiven. It was not understood from him or any of the
Companions that the person is free to commit sins and neglect
religious duties. In fact these people were even busier in
exerting more effort and feared more after they received the
good news than before. This applies more to the ten people
who were given the good news of entering Paradise. Abu Bakr,
for instance was known to be even more cautious and he
feared Allah a great deal. Likewise, ‘Umar believed that this
good news is limited by its conditions, and so remained
constant in piety until his death. Obviously, ‘Umar continued to
avoid anything that was forbidden. None of them understood
that they were given absolute permission to do whatever they
wanted.

* Recorded by Al-Bukhary, from the book of At-Tawhid, section of the
following Quranic verse,...\s4 ‏يريذون أن‎ " "which means, (They want to
change.....). No. (7507), and Muslim, from the book of At-Tawbah, section of
acceptance of repentance even if the sins have been repeated. No. (2758).
Both of them have been narrated by Abu Hurairah, and they are traceable
hadiths.

A Precious Gem of Wisdom: The Interpretation of
the Qur’anic Verse,

Allah, the Almighty says,
3 ‏اص‎
‏وكلوا مِن رَرْقِهِ- وَإِلَيهِ‎ GSU ‏لكم الأَرَضَ ذلولا فامشوأ فى‎ ee ‏الذى‎ je «

AS ‏مى‎

yrs, 4 & 3 ‏أ‎

which means: “He it is, Who has made the earth subservient to
you (i.e. easy for you to walk, to live and to do agriculture on it,
etc.), SO walk in the path thereof and eat of His provision, and to
Him will be the Resurrection.” (Al-Mulk, 67:15)

Allah, Exalted be He, told us that He made the earth
subservient for mankind to tread, dig, cultivate and build on.
He did not make it difficult for people who need to do all these
things in life. Allah, the Almighty also said that He made the
earth like a bed, a resting place, a wide expanse, a fixed abode
and a receptacle. And He also said that He has spread it,
brought forth water from it, and pasture. He has fixed
mountains on it, placed therein broad highways and roads. He
caused rivers and springs of water to flow, and bestowed
blessings upon it and predestinated its substance.

Among its blessings is that every kind of animal and their
sustenance come from the earth Also when a seed is put into
the earth, it brings it forth multiplied for the benefit of mankind.
The earth also carries dirt on itself and brings forth from within
itself the best of things and everything that benefits man. It
hides all foul things and brings forth all that is sweet. Among its
blessings, is that it covers the waste of people and brings forth
food and drink for them. Therefore, it is the most perfect thing
for bearing harm, and the most perfect thing for bringing about
benefit. Nothing that comes out of the earth is better than the
earth itself. What is meant here is that Allah, the Almighty

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 29

made the earth for us like a docile camel that allows itself to
be ridden by anyone. The Arabic word "Manakibha" means its
paths, and is the best expression to convey the meaning of
subservience concerning roads and pathways. The walker
treads on its paths, which is its highest point. That is why the
word "Manakib" has been explained as the shoulders of a
human being. They said, “That means that walking on its plains
is easier.” Another group said, “The word “Manakib" means,
sides and areas, as well 35 the sides of man. What is meant is
that "Manakib" means, the raised parts of the earth, and the
surface that the animal walks on is the highest part of the earth,
for the outside of the ball is its surface, and walking takes place
on its surface. That is why it is a good expression to use the
word, "Dhaldf which means, subservient.

Then He ordained that mankind should eat from His Provision,
which He provided. He subjugated it for them, leveled it and
made ways and roads in it which people walk on. He also
provided their provision in it. And He mentioned the preparation
of residence for benefit and moving around it; back and forth,
and eating from that which is provided for the resident. Then
He warned mankind by saying the following verse, "//aihi An-
Nushur' to mean that we are not destined to stay in this abode
forever, but we have simply entered it as a passer by.
Therefore, we should not take it as a real homeland and a
permanent abode, as the only reason for us entering _ it is to
provide ourselves with provision for the Hereafter. The verse
indicates Allah’s Lordship and Oneness, His Power, Wisdom,
Mercy, the remembrance of His Favors and His Kindness. It
also contains a warning not to rely on this present life and
take it as one’s permanent homeland and abode, but rather,
we should speed up and move toward His Paradise. Therefore,
this verse speaks about His Knowledge, His Oneness, the
remembrance of His Favors, the desire to return to Him, the
preparation to meet Him, the coming to Him, the knowledge
that Allah, the Almighty will roll up this world as if it had not

30 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

existed and then He will resurrect its people after He had
caused them to die, and indeed to Him will be the
Resurrection.

A Precious Gem: Al-Fatihah and the Wisdom it
Contains

Man’s endeavors in life arise from two main capacities: (i) a
theoretical capacity of awareness, and (li) a practical capacity of
willingness to act. Therefore his complete happiness depends
on both. The perfection of the theoretical capacity of awareness
comes about by knowing his Creator, and His Beautiful Names
and Attributes. It also lies in knowing the road that leads to Him
and its obstacles, and by knowing his own self and its flaws. By
means of these things, he will attain perfection of the
theoretical capacity of awareness. The most knowledgeable
people are those who know them best.

The perfection of the practical capacity of willingness to act,
does not occur unless the rights of Allah, the Almighty are
observed by the servant. The rights of Allah are fulfilled by
performing one’s obligations with sincerity, honesty, advice,
kindness, and acknowledging His favor upon him.

Therefore, the servant of Allah feels shy to stand before Him
with the small amount of service he did for Allah, because he
knows that it is far below what He deserves. He also knows that
there is no way to perfect these two capacities unless Allah
helps Him. So he desires to be guided to the Straight Way, to
which He guides His sincere servants and helps them avoid
the things that would let them stray from that Way, either by an
imperfection in his capacity of awareness, or by an imperfection
in his practical capacity. Going astray incurs the wrath of Allah,
the Almighty.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 31

Therefore, man’s perfection and happiness cannot be complete
without these things. Sdrat Al-Fatihah has mentioned them
and has arranged them perfectly.

Allah, the Almighty says,

which means, “All praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Lord
of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exits). The Most
Gracious, the Most Merciful. The Only Owner (and Only Ruling
Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of
Resurrection).” (Al-Fatihah, 1:1-4)

These Quranic verses contain the first principle, and that is to
have knowledge of the Lord, Exalted be He, and to have
knowledge of His Beautiful Names, Attributes and Deeds. The
Names that are mentioned in this Sdrat are the bases of the
Beautiful Names of Allah, the Almighty, namely Ar-Rabb and
Ar-Rahman.

The Name ‘Allah’ belongs to the Divine Attributes, and the
Name ‘Ar-Rabb’ belongs to His attributes of Lordship and the
Name ‘Ar-Rahman’ belongs to the qualities of Benevolence and
Generosity. |

His statement,

&

D ‏تمي‎ sy Ss Ip
which means, “You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we
ask for help (for each and everything). (Al-Fatihah, 1:5)

This Quranic verse contains the knowledge of the road that
leads to Him, which is only found by worshipping Him Alone
with that which He loves and prefers, and by asking His Help to
worship Him properly.

32 ٠» AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

And His statement,
4 2: aa byall Gaal»

which means, “Guide us to the Straight Way” (Al-Fatihah, 1:6)

This Quranic verse declares that the servant has no way to
achieve happiness except by keeping on the Straight Way,
and that there is no way to this straight path without the
guidance of Allah. And just as he cannot worship Him, except
with His Help, he cannot stand firm on the road except with His
guidance.

The following Qur’anic statement,
“ILall ‏1ل‎ 24 12 AU Ot

which means, “Not (the way) of those who earned Your Anger
(such as the Jews), nor of those who went astray (such as the
Christians). (Al-Fatihah, 1:7)

This Quranic verse declares that there are two ways to
deviate from the Straight Way, and that one way is corruption
of knowledge and belief, and the other is that concerned with
the corruption of one’s intentions and actions.

Therefore, the beginning of the Sarat speaks about mercy, the
middie speaks about guidance and the end speaks about
favor and blessings. The servant receives blessings according
to his level of guidance, and the guidance he receives is
according to the amount of mercy he receives from Allah. So
the whole issue returns to His Blessings and Mercy, which are
the characteristics of Lordship.

Therefore, He is Merciful and the Benefactor, and that is one of
the characteristics of Divinity. He is the true God, even if the
ungrateful choose to deny it and even if the polytheists treat
others like they should only treat Him. So, whoever complies

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 33

with the meaning of Al-Fatihah in terms of knowledge, action,
and a way of life, the person will have then successfully
perfected himself, and his submission will have become the
same as those whose degree has been raised above the
common worshippers. And it is Allan whose aid is to be
implored.

A Precious Gem: Two Ways to Know Allah

Allah, the Exalted invites His servants to know Him in two
ways:

The first one is: by observing His creation and pondering.

The second one is: by reflecting on His Quranic Verses. The
first one is His signs in the universe, and the second one is the
comprehension of His Verses of the Qu’ran.

The first one is illustrated in the following Qur’anic verse,

Stig cd Sault oh Maks ‏وَالأرض‎ pl ge ‏فى‎ >

which means, “Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the
earth, and in the alternation of night and day, and the ships
which sail through the sea with that which is of use to mankind,
and the water (rain) which Allan sends down from the sky and
makes the earth alive therewith after its death, and the moving
(living) creatures of all kinds that He has scattered therein, and
in the veering of winds and clouds which are held between the
sky and the earth, are indeed Ayat (proofs, evidences, signs,
etc.) for people of understanding.” (Al-Baqarah, 2:164)

34 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

And the following Quranic verse,
‏مه 2ه‎ a rh Lae, ‏مار رصع 7 72 مهد‎ “ 2 . g 1
Seed ‏لا وى‎ ee Gy ‏وَالآرْض وَاخْتَلف اليل‎ RI ‏إرنّ فى خلق‎ «

which means, “Verily! In the creation of the heavens and the
earth, and in the alternation of night and day, there are indeed
signs for men of understanding.” (Al-‘Imran, 3: 190)

There are many other verses having the same meaning.

The second is illustrated by the Quranic verse, which goes as
follows:

‎rs 2 —— 8‏ صه م 2 ‎we 7 2 4 3 8 2 - 2a‏ “ 3

‎which means, “Have they not pondered over the Word (of Allah,

Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.” (Sad,
38:29)

‎There are many other Quranic verses that have the same
meaning.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 35

Creation indicates actions, and actions indicate attributes, for
the creation indicates the existence of a creator, and that
requires His existence, ability, will and knowledge. It Is
impossible that a voluntary action proceeds from something that
is nonexistent, helpless, lifeless, ignorant and having no will.

Moreover, the various characteristics in the creation prove the
existence of the Creator’s will, and that His action is repetitive.
The elements of creation concerning interests, and
praiseworthy purposes, indicate His wisdom. Those parts of
creation, which are beneficial, and good, indicate His Mercy.
In the same way, the fact that He Seizes, takes retribution and
metes out punishment, indicates His Anger. The honor He
bestows on His creatures, their closeness and care, indicate
His Love. The fact that He banishes and abandons, indicates
His Hatred and Abhorrence.

Every element of nature begins in a weak and incomplete state,
then develops and grows to its complete and final state and
this fact points to the reality of the Hereafter. The conditions of
olants and animals, and the flow of water indicate the reality of
the Hereafter. Man continually witnesses the effects of mercy
and blessings upon creation and these indicate the fulfillment
of prophecies. The creation of Allah is perfect to the extent that
if any of its elements are removed there would be some kind of
inadequacy, and this indicates that the Giver of perfection is
truly deserving of praise and thanksmore than anyone or
anything else.

Therefore, His creation really shows His Attributes and the
truthfulness of that which His Prophets reported about Him. The
creation is then evidence that confirms the verses of Qu’ran to
be true and draws our attention to the signs in creation.

Allah, the Almighty said,

me

36 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

which means, “We will show them Our Signs in the universe.
and in their ownselves, until it becomes manifest to them that
this (the Qur'an) is the truth.” (Fussilat, 41:53)

This simply means that the Qur'an is the truth. And He said that
He will show them (the disbelievers) some of His signs that can
be seen, and will make clear to them the truthfulness of His
Verses (the Quran).

He then said that His witness is sufficient for the truthfulness of
the evidence and proof that He provided concerning the
authenticity of His Prophet. Therefore, His Verses are true
evidence, and He is a true witness for His Prophet through His
verses. So He is the Witness and the witnessed for, and He is
the Evidence and the Indicated to. He is the Evidence by
Himself about Himself, as some of the most knowledgeable
people of Allah said, “How can | ask for the Evidence of whom
is an Evidence for me over all things? If you ask for any
evidence of Him, you will find that His Existence is more evident
than that.” That is why the Messengers (peace be upon them)
said, “What! Can there be a doubt about Allah?” (brahim,
14:10) Therefore, He is more Known than all that is known and
more evident than all evidence. Realistically, everything in the
universe is proven to be a created object by the fact that there
must be a creator, which is Allah, the Almighty; yet, and by way
of deductive reasoning, He Himself is recognized through the
existence of such creatures as well as through His actions and
laws, which organize the course of all creatures in the
universe.

A Precious Gem: Prophetic Hadiths Eliminating
Grief and Distress

It is recorded in Musnad Ahmad and Sahih Abu Hatim on the
authority of ‘Abdullah bin Mas'id that the Messenger of Allah
(peace be upon him) said, "Whoever was afflicted with grief and
distress and says, ‘Allahumma inny ‘abduk, wa ibn ‘abdik,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 37

wa ibn amatik, nasiyaty biyadik, madin fiyya Nukmuk,
‘Adlun fiyya qada'uk, as'‘aluka bikul ism huwa_ lak,
sammaita bihi nafsak, aw anzaltahu fy kitabik, aw

ghaibi 'indik, an taj'ala al-qur'ana rabi'a qalby, wa nura

Your Servant, the son of Your Servant, the son of Your Maid
servant. You have control over me. Your Judgment is executed
on me. Your Decree on me is just. | ask You by each Name of
Yours by which You have called Yourself, revealed in Your
Book, taught to any of Your servants, or kept as a secret in the
knowledge of the unseen with You, to make the Qur'an the
spring (delight) of my heart, the light of my chest, the eliminator
of my sorrow, and the remover of my worries), Allah, the
Exalted and Ever-Majestic, will remove his grief and will change
his sorrow into happiness." It was said, "O Messenger of Allah!
(Do) we have to learn these words?" He said, "Yes, whoever
hears them should learn them."

This great prophetic tradition implies certain matters of
knowledge, monotheism and submission, for example the
supplicant starts by saying, "! am Your servant, the son of Your
servant, and the son of Your maid servant." This includes the
forefathers of the supplicant until we reach Adam and Eve. In
other words, the supplication indicates submission and full
compliance to Allah, besides the confession of being His
servant along with his forefathers.

It asserts the fact that the servant has no one but his Lord, His
blessings and His graces. Whenever his Lord ignores him,
surely he is a looser, with no refuge or support.

This confession means, ! am in dire need of You, and | have no
supporter or refuge other than You and it infers that the
supplicant is submissive, obedient, and forbearing. He acts
according to his submission to Allah, not according to his
feelings of self-sufficiency. To provide help and comfort is the

38 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

role of kings and masters, not servants. However, the actions of
servants are based on submission, in order to reach the level
of those obedient servants described by Allah, the Exalted.
Allah says,

‎Sy >‏ عِبَادِى لَيْسَ لَكَ ‎ele‏ لطن ...20 »4

‎which means, "Certainly, you shall have no authority over My
slaves." (Al-Hijr, 15:42)

‎And He, the Aimignty says,

‎which means, "And the slaves of the Most Beneficent (Allah)
are those who walk on the earth in humility and sedateness."
(Al-Furqan, 25:63)

‎Other kinds of servants are those slaves of submission and
lordship. Ascribing them to Allah resembles ascribing houses to
His Kingdom, or ascribing the Sacred Mosque to Him, or like
ascribing the Camel to Him, or His Paradise, and finally
ascribing the submission of His Messenger to Him in the
following Qur'anic verse,

‎2G. go > .,4 4 1‏ رك اس
« وَإن ‎FS‏ رَيْبٍ مِمَا 5 على ‎cE). bare‏ €

‎which means, "And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians)
are in doubt conceming that which We have sent down (i.e. the
Qur'an) to Our slave (Muhammad)..." (Al-Bagarah, 2:23)

‎And He, the Almighty says,

‏م - 4 3

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 39

which means, "Glorified (and Exalted) be He (Allah) [above all
that (evil) they associate with Him] Who took His slave
(Muhammad SAW) for a journey by night.” (Al-lsra', 17:1)

And He, the Almighty says,

4 )29... ‏يَدَعُوهُ‎ abl Age 6 Cl 215 «
which means, "(It has been revealed to me that) When the
slave of Allah (Muhammad SAW) stood up invoking (his Lord
Allah) in prayer to Him..." (Al-Jinn, 72:19)

Submission

The correct meaning of, "| am Your servant" indicates full
submission, compliance, and repentance to Allah, as well as
being obedient to one's Lord and avoiding His prohibitions,
depending on Him, seeking His help and support, seeking
refuge in Him from evil, and finally being related to Him with
feelings of love, fear and hope. It also indicates, 1١ am Your
servant in all cases, whether young or grown up, living or dead,
obedient or disobedient, in a good condition or otherwise (i.e.
being afflicted in the soul, heart, tongue or bodily organs)."

Moreover, it means, "| am all Yours, both my money and
myself," for the servant and all that which he possesses belong
to his master.

It also means, "You are the one who bestowed all those
blessings upon me, so those blessings are really Yours."

lt also includes, "| can't act freely in that which You granted me,
either my money or myself, except by Your orders, as no
servant can behave freely except with his master's permission.
| can neither hurt nor benefit myself, and | possess no power
(of causing) death, nor (of giving) life, nor of raising the dead.
So, if he really believes in all that which was _ previously
mentioned, then he has confessed his full submission to Allah.

40 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

The sentence, "My forelock is in Your hands," means, "I cannot
act freely as far as my soul is concerned,” for how can he act
freely when his soul is possessed by his Lord, his forelock is in
His hands, his heart is between two of His fingers, and
moreover, his death, life, happiness, misery, good-condition,
and affliction are in the charge of his Lord, the Exalted? By no
means Is the servant in the charge of himself. The master owns
him, and he is weaker than any worthless slave whose forelock
is in the grasp of a powerful and mighty ruler. It is so much
more than that.

Whenever the servant of Allah confesses the fact that his
forelock and the forelock of all other servants are in the grasp of
Allah (i.e. under His control), he will neither fear nor aspire to
any worldly sovereign nor will he overestimate them, because
he knows quite well that they are but subdued servants, whose
destiny is controlled by Allah. Whoever confesses this fact,
surely will stand in need of Allah and whenever he witnesses
the reality of other people, he will neither overestimate them nor
exaggerate in seeking their support. In this way, his belief, trust
and submission will be turned to Allah alone. This is the reason
behind Had's speech to his people when he said in the Qur'anic
verse,

الس امرك” م ‎Ae a ts 40 2 2 & ee‏
« إن ‎Je CS‏ الله ‎Go‏ وَرَبَكُم ما مِن دَآبَّةِ إلا هوّ ءَاخِد ينَاصيتها إن ‎G9‏ على

which means, "| put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord!
There is not a moving (living) creature but He has grasp of its
forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the Straight Path (the truth)."
(Hdd, 11:56)

The sentence, "Your Judgment is executed on me. Your Decree
on me is just," implies two themes, the first of which is the
execution of His judgment on His servant.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 1

The second theme implies praising Him and that His Decree is
just, in addition to the fact that Allah, the Exalted, is the
Dominion, and that to Him belong all praise and thanks, and
that is the meaning of HUtd's words, "There is not a moving
(living) creature but He has grasp of its forelock," and also his
words, “Verily, my Lord is on the Straight Path (the truth)." In
other words, despite the fact that Allah is the Dominion, the
Aimighty and the Controller of the destiny of His servants as
their forelocks are in His grasp, yet He is on the straight path.
He is the Just One, Who oversees His servants’ affairs justly.
He is on the straight path in His words, His actions, His
judgment, His destiny, His commandments, His prohibitions, His
rewards and His punishment. His verses are truthful, His
Judgment is correct, and His commandments are beneficial.
He prohibited all that which is evil and mischievous. His reward
descends upon those who deserve His mercy and grace. His
punishment descends upon those who deserve torment by
means of His Justice and wisdom.

Judgment and Decree

There is a distinction between judgment and decree, because
judgments are executed and decrees are just.

The judgment of Allah, the Exalted, implies His legitimate
judgment and His preordained judgment upon the whole
universe. Both judgments are executed on human beings, who
are subjected to them, either willingly or unwillingly. However,
there is only one distinction between the two, the preordained
universal judgment is compulsory, whereas the _ religious
judgment is optional.

On the other hand, decree means completion and perfection
whenever it is executed. The expression "Your decree is just"
means "Your decree which you completed, and perfected is the
rightful one.

42 © AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

The word "judgment" refers to every commandment prescribed
by Allah, the Exalted. The judgment of Allah is ordained.
Religious judgments will surely be executed, and universal
ones will be executed if it is ordained by Allah. Verily, Allah
executes that which He ordains, and anyone else can decide
whichever judgment he wants but he may still lack the ability
to execute it. Allah alone has the power of judgment and
implementation. The expression, "Your decree is just"
comprises ail the decrees ordained by Allah upon His servant:
lIness or health, luxury or poverty, pleasure or pain, life or
death, punishment or reward etc.

Allah, the Exalted, says,
‏صر‎ - 4 45, Jf of 5 ‏رسع © ساس _ 7 3 لت ما شد‎

which means, "And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is
because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons
much." (Ash-Shara, 42:30)

And He, the Almighty also says,

which means, "but when some ill befalls them because of the
deeds which their hands have sent forth, then verily, man
(becomes) ingrate!" (Ash-Shira, 42:48)

Every decree ordained upon the servant of Allah is just.
The Perception of Destiny and Decree in Other Sects

|] was argued, "If sin is preordained by Allah's decree and
destiny, then, where is justice?" Justice here is concealed.

It was replied, "That's a good question, and for that reason a
sect once claimed that only justice is preordained but injustice
is inconceivable." They answered, "Injustice is the disposal in

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 43

other's property, and Allah is the Owner of all things.
Accordingly, His disposal of affairs is just, concerning His
creation.

Another sect claimed, "Justice means to abstain from punishing
for that which is preordained and predestined, so as long as He
approved of the punishment, then — sin is neither preordained
nor predetermined. Thus, punishment for one’s sin is just, and it
is the consequence of one’s words and deeds in this worldly
life.”

It was difficult for this sect to combine justice and destiny. They
claimed that whoever believes in destiny, should never believe
in justice, and likewise whoever believes in justice should never
believe in destiny. It was hard for them, as well, to combine
monotheism with the validity of the Attributes of Allah. They
claimed that it is impossible to validate monotheism except by
disbelieving in the Attributes of Allah. In brief, their monotheism
turned out to be suspension, and their justice turned out to
disbelief in Justice.

On the other hand, the Sunnis believe in both (i.e. justice &
destiny). Their definition of Injustice is putting a matter in other
than its place, like punishing the obedient and Innocent person.
Verily, Allah is too Exalted for this, which is His characteristic
as explained in the Glorious Qur'an. The fact that Allah, the
Exalted, sends astray whom He wills, and preordained sin and
transgression on whomever He wills, is simply justice, because
He places mischief and aberration in its right place. It is worth
mentioning that one of the Names of Allah is ‏عط‎ Just,’ whose
judgments are correct, proper and rightful.

Moreover, Allah clarified all paths, by sending His Messengers,
and revealing His Divine Books. He facilitates the ways of
guidance and obedience by means of hearing, insight and the
use of the mind, which is justice.

44 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Furthermore, Allah guides him who wants to be guided which is
a great blessing. On the other hand, He sends astray those who
are unworthy as well as those who are unwilling to receive the
blessings of Allah, so He deprived them of His blessing but not
His justice. Such people are divided into two kinds.

The first kind is him whom Allah leaves to stray due to his
misguidance as he turned away from Allah, preferring His
enemy and neglecting to remember and thank Him. As a result,
he deserves to be abandoned by Allah.

The second kind is those whom Allah is initially unwilling to
support, because He knows that they underestimate the
guidance of Allah. Such people are not thankful to Allah and
do not praise Him, and this is the reason behind their being
deprived of His blessings.

Allah, the Exalted, says,

1 سم ‎OL‏ هر د

Sol ek ‏مِنْ‎ ele OI ‏مرى‎ patil ad ‏بِبَعْض‎ a cid; }
” oe ‏مر‎ 7

which means, "Thus We have tried some of them with others,
that they might say: "Is it these (poor believers) that Allah has
favoured from amongst us?" Does not Allah know best those
who are grateful?" (Al-An'am, 6:53)

طحب

He, the Almighty also says,

which means, "Had Allah known of any good in them, He would
indeed have made them listen." (Al-Anfal, 8:23)

So, if Allah decrees misguidance and disobedience upon these
souls, then it is just, like for example His decree that the
serpent and the scorpion can be killed. All these decrees are

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 45

just, for they have been created with such characteristics. We
mentioned this subject in detail in the book, "The Decree and
the Destiny."

In brief, the supplication, "Your judgment is executed on me and
Your decree on me is just" is the best answer to both sects, the
Anti-Fatalists who deny the decrees of Allah upon His
servants and believe that man's actions are excluded from the
destiny and the decree of Allah, and it is also a refutation
against the other sect, "The Jabriyyah" who believe that every
decree is just a concept which makes that supplication -
namely, "Your decree on me is just" - of no value. According to
them justice is every predetermined applicable action while
injustice is inconceivable. Invocation using the Names of
Allah

The expression, "| ask You by each Name of Yours ....... etc’,
is an invocation with all the Names of Allah whether they are
known or unknown. It is allowable in the Sight of Allah, as it is
an invocation with the Attributes of Allah which refers to the
connotations of His Names.

The expression, "to make the Qur'an the spring (delight) of my
heart, the light of my chest,” the word ‘spring’ means the rain,
which brings life to the earth. The Qur'an is compared to rain
because it revives the hearts. He makes a similarity between
water, which is the cause of life, and between light, which is the
cause of brightness. Allah, the Exalted, makes that similarity in
the Qur'anic verse in, which He says,

4 ‏رم‎ fee Bait ‏يي‎ oe 2 B. of 2 4-7 ‏لحي‎ T- eit ‏سوس‎ &

©« انزل ‎Te‏ السَّماءٍ ‎tL‏ فسالت اودية بقدرها فاحتمل السّيل رَبَدا رَابِيا وَمِمَا
‎ale Oy day:‏ فى ‎al WW‏ حليّة ...© »

which means, "He sends down water (rain) from the sky, and

the valleys flow according to their measure, but the flood bears
away the foam that mounts up to the surface, and (also) from

46 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

that (ore) which they heat in the fire in order to make
ornaments." (Ar-Ra'd, 13:17)

Allah, the Exalted, says,

which means, "Or like a rainstorm from the sky." (Al-Baqarah,
2:19)

And the verse in which Allah says,

4 220... 2M pe Sl ‏نُورُ‎ abl»
which means, “Allah is the Light of the heavens and the
earth...." (An-Nar, 24:35)

And the verse in which Allah says,

See ‏عه" عو‎ gt ‏”سمه ترص‎ gk ‏تر مد‎
» 220... Mba ‏تر أنَ اله يريج ابا َم‎ ally
which means, “See you not that Allah drives the clouds gently,
then joins them together....... " (An-Ndr, 24:43)

So the supplication implies that the heart is revived by the
spring of the Qur'an, for it is the light of the chest, a concept,
which combines life and light.

Allah, the Almighty says,
fog pee id ‏ده‎ 2s ‏دروم رماس م‎ Fo 27, 2 ‏رم شا‎
7 ‏ِو‎ _ ae at

which means, "Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance
and disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and Faith)
and set for him a light (of Belief) whereby he can walk amongst
men, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7

and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out?" (Al-An'am,
6:122)

Since the chest is broader than the heart, then enlightening It
will surely affect the heart. The life of the body and organs are
dependant on the life of the heart, which derives life from the
chest and then gives life to the organs.

On the other hand, if grief, distress, and sorrow contradict the
life of the heart and its brightness, the supplication involves the
desire that they be totally removed by the Qur'an.

However, if the previous feelings are to be removed by other
than the Qur'an, for example, enjoying health, this worldly life,
status, a wife or children, then surely those feelings are
temporary and will eventually dissipate. There are three kinds of
passive feelings, which affect the heart and they are either
related to the past, which causes sorrow, or related to the future
so as to cause grief, or finally related to the present so as to
cause distress.

A Precious Gem: The Throne and the Heart

Allah is the most Exalted from all that exists, and that is why
He, the Almighty is the only One who deserves the Almighty
throne. The closest thing to the throne that exists, is the
brightest, the most honorable and the highest from all creation
and thatis the part of Paradise called al Firdaws.

Accordingly, the most distant place from the throne is the
gloomiest and the narrowest place; it is the lowest of the low
and is far distant from any blessing.

Allah, the Almighty created the hearts of man and made them
the source of knowledge, love, and the desire to aspire to
Him. Hence, the hearts of man are the pivot point of his
existence.

Allah, the Exalted, says,

48 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

= - 47 eee ‏فر‎ 6 2 ge ge te ao. Tare oe eee ‏ع ع‎ gt we
4 2: ‏المَثل الأعلى وَهوَ العزِيزٌ الحكيم‎ ay GUT ‏بالاجرة‎ OLY ‏لا‎ Gall 3

which means, " For those who believe not in the Hereafter is an
evil description, and for Allah is the highest description. And He
is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise." (An-Nahl, 16:60)

Allah, the Almighty says,
1 ‏ور 7 در 7 رامو 3 رعو صدرا عو ل يا‎ 7 zt aye ie rae te 0
‏وَهوّ أهوّرىُ عليه وله المثل الاعلى فى‎ votes 25 ‏وهو الذى يِبَدَوَأْ الحلق‎ «
75 Dae ‏ص 5 3 7 4 مالس‎ 07 ae
4D ‏الحكيم‎ Ryall ‏السَّمَوتٍ وَالارْض وهو‎

which means, " And He it is Who originates the creation, then
will repeat it (after it has been perished), and this is easier for
Him. His is the highest description (i.e. none has the right to be
worshipped but He, and there is nothing comparable unto Him)
in the heavens and in the earth. And He is the Almighty, the All
Wise." (Ar-ROm, 30:27)

Allah, the Almighty says,

which means, “There is nothing like unto Him." (Ash-Shdara,
42:11)

In other words, loving, knowing and aspiring to Allah are the
true definition of the heart of the sincere believer.

If the heart is not pure or honorable enough, and distant from
every evil and malice, then it is unworthy to 'love, know and
aspire to Allah. On the contrary, the lowest description of man’s
heart is that he loves and aspires to this worldly life instead of to
Allah, the Almighty. When man’s love, knowledge and
aspiration is directed in this worldly way, the heart becomes
narrow and gloomy as it is distant from the source of its revival
and life.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 9

Subsequently, the hearts of man can be divided into two kinds,
the first of which is the heart of those, who incline to the
Beneficent, which is the source of brightness, life, happiness,
pleasure, delight and blessings. The second one is the throne
of the devil where narrowness, darkness, death, sorrow,
distress and grief are settled therein. This heart is obsessed by
sorrow for the past, and grief and distress for the present.

At-Tirmidhy and others narrated, "The Prophet (peace be upon
him) said, ‘If the heart is overwhelmed by the brightness (of
faith), surely it will be opened and delighted.' They said, 0
Messenger of Allah! What is the sign for that?’ He replied,
‘Resorting to the eternal dwelling (i.e. Paradise), being averted
from the dwelling of deceit (i.e. the worldly life), and being
prepared for death before its arrival."

In brief, the brightness, which overwhelms the heart is the
impact of being close to Allah, the Almighty and obtaining His
blessings of serenity and guidance. This fills the heart with
pleasure, while lacking such feelings that come from knowing
Allah and loving Him, makes it a gloomy and narrow place.

A Precious Gem: The Content of the Qur'an

lf we look closely at the words of the Quran, we will find a
Sovereign, to whom belongs all Dominion and all praise and
thanks are due to Him, all affairs are in His grasp, and He is the
source and the end of all affairs. He rose over His throne, and
no secret of His kingdom shall ever be hidden from Him, as He
is the Knower of the servants’ souls. He Alone is the Planner of
the kingdom's affairs. He hears, sees, grants, averts, rewards,
punishes, honors, abases, creates, gives and takes life,
provides estimates, judges, and conducts the affairs of man.

The decrees, whether minor or major, descend and ascend by
His permission. Nothing can move, even equal to the weight of
an atom, except by His permission; not a leaf falls, but He
knows It.

50 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Let's think about the way, in which He praises and glorifies
Himself, and how He warns His servants and guides them to
Nappiness and salvation, by directing their interest to the right
path. He warns them against the way of destruction. He
acquaints them with His Names and Attributes, and He gets
closer to them by bestowing His blessings and grace upon
them. He reminds them of His blessings, and orders them to
the way of salvation. He warns them against His wrath,
reminding them of the reward prepared for them if they are
obedient, and also of the torment prepared for them if they are
disobedient. He narrates the stories of the believers and the
disbelievers as well 35 the end of both parties.

He praises the believers by virtue of their good deeds and
qualities, and He dispraises His enemies by their wrong doings
and evil qualities. He sets forth parables and provides
evidence and proof. He refutes the lies of His enemies by
portraying the best of answers, and believing the truthful and
belying the liars. He says the truth and guides to the right path.

He calls to the dwelling of peace, mentioning its characteristics,
and its bliss. He warns against the dwelling of destruction,
mentioning its torment, awfulness and pain.

He mentions His servants and their need for Him at all times:
there is never a time when they are not in need of Him, even
for the twinkling of an eye. He states His richness above all
creatures, and the fact the He is free of all needs and wants.
He mentions the fact that all creatures stand in need of Him,
and no one can attain the least blessing or more except by His
Mercy and Grace, and no one can be afflicted by the least
amount of evil or more except by His justice and wisdom.

The speech of Allah implies His gentle admonition to the
believers, because in spite of everything He raises them from
their falls, forgives and excuses them, reforms their corruption,
and supports them. For them, He is the defender, the supporter,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 51

the sustainer, and the rescuer from every distress. He always
fulfills His promises. They have no protector other than Him, for
He is their true Master, and their Helper against their enemies,
so what an excellent Protector and what an excellent Helper.

If the hearts witness through the Qur'an, a glorious, great,
bountiful, merciful sovereign like this, then how can these
hearts stop loving Him, and how can they not compete In
approaching Him and getting closer to Him? For them, that
sovereign should be the most lovable of all, and His satisfaction
should be sought more than the satisfaction of others.

Really, how can these hearts stop remembering Him, since
loving and longing for Him are the source of power and
remedy, to the extent that if the hearts do not have these things,
then destruction and corruption would be their destiny, and
their lives would be of no value.

A Precious Gem: No Place for Two Contradictions

In order for a place to contain something, it must be free from
whatever contradicts it. This principle applies to mankind and
all creation as well as to belief and desires.

So, if the heart is obsessed by belief in falsehood, there will be
no place for truth. Accordingly, if the tongue Is involved in trivial
discourse, one shall be incapable of useful speech, unless
falsehood is abandoned.

Hence, if the body is busy doing wrong actions, then acts of
worship will be inapplicable unless these contradictory actions
are abandoned.

This is how this principle is applied to concrete objects, and it
is also applied to belief and religion. If the heart deviates from
loving Allah, lacks yearning for Him and longing for His
closeness, then the removal of contradictory feelings, like being
related to other than Allah, is the only way for this heart to be
overwhelmed by love for Allah.

52 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

For the tongue to remember Allah, and the body to serve Him,
one should be free of the impact of others like being busy
remembering and serving them.

Thus, if the heart is overwhelmed by the servants rather than
the master, and is preoccupied with futile knowledge, surely
there will be no place for being closer to Allah, or being
acquainted with His Names, Attributes and judgments.

If the heart listens to trivial discourse, there will be no place for
listening or understanding the words of Allah. Besides, if the
heart is inclined to love others, there will be no room to love
Ailah, and if the heart remembers others rather than Allah, no
place will be found to remember Him, and the same applies to
the tongue.

Al-Bukhary recorded that the Prophet (peace be upon him)
said, “It is better for any of you that the inside of his body be
filled with pus which may consume his body, than it be filled
with poetry."10

This Prophetic tradition explained-that it is possible that the
inside of one's body may be filled with poetry, which means
that it might be exposed to suspicion, doubts. illusions,
uncertainties, futile knowledge, and trivial discourse.

So, if the heart is filled with such things, the facts of the Qur'an
and precious knowledge, which cause happiness and perfection
in mankind, will find no room in that heart.

If a heart receives advice but it is filled with what contradicts it,
there will be no place in that heart to accept this advice. The
advice will simply pass over this heart and not be able to settle
in it.

'° Recorded by Al-Bukhary, in His Sahih, Book of Al-Adab (Good Manners
and Form), Chapter on not recommending poetry, no. (6154), and recorded by
Muslim in His Sahih no. (2258).

Interpretation of Chapter At-Takathur
In which Allah, the Almighty says,

» BEET Sag «

which means, "The mutual rivalry for piling up of worldly things
diverts you..." (At-Takathur, 102:1)

Until the end of the chapter.

This chapter talks about promise, threat, and menace. It gives
exhortation to whoever understands. Allah says,

sb 36
4» ©... RGD
which means, "diverts you..." (At-Takathur, 102:1)

That is to say, those matters divert you in a way that you are
not to be excused. You are busy doing something else. If this
diversion is intentional then the obligatory acts of worship have
been violated, and if it was unintentional as when the Prophet
(peace be upon him) said once about a Khamisah, "....for it has
just now diverted my attention from my prayer...""" its owner will
be excused and it will be considered a form of forgetfulness.
The heart can be diverted and the limbs can be misused and
that is why they are gathered together. That is why Allah says
which means, “The mutual rivalry for piling up of worldly things
diverts you." (At-Takathur, 102:1) and did not say, ".... busies
you.” A worker can use his body in his work while his heart Is

in order to keep it general. Whatever the servants are mutually
pilling up rather than obeying Allah and His Messenger and
every matter that will be useful to him on the day of his
Resurrection, is to be included in this mutual rivalry. Mutual
rivalry could be money, power, authority, women, speech, or
knowledge. This is especially true when the person is in need
of this object. It could extend to those things that are not
necessary, like further books, volumes, and unnecessary
questioning and its branches. Mutual rivalry is when man seeks
to acquire more than others and this is dispraised unless it is for
something that will bring him close to Allah. Mutual rivalry
includes competing in doing good deeds. Muslim recorded that
Abdullah bin Ash-Shikhkhir (may Allah be pleased with him)
narrated, “| came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon
him) as he was reciting, "The mutual rivalry for piling up of
worldly things diverts you..." (At-Takathur, 102:1). He said, 'The
son of Adam claims, 'My wealth, my wealth.' And he (the Holy
Prophet) said, 'O son of Adam! Is there anything that really
belongs to you, except that which you consumed, which you
utilized, or which you wore and then it was worn out or you
gave as charity and sent it forward for yourself?"

e He, who did not make use of his eye, did not make use
of his ear.

e The servant has a veil between him and Allah and
another one between him and people. Whoever tore this
veil between him and Allah, Allah will tear the veil
between him and people.

e The servant has a Lord that he will stand in front of and

of Allah before meeting Him and he should furnish his
house before moving into It.

Loosing time is harder than death, as loosing time keeps
you away from Allah and the Hereafter, while death
keeps you away from the worldly life and your people.

The whole world from its beginning until its end is not
worth an hour of sadness, so what about the sadness of
a whole life.

What we love today will catch up with what we hate
tomorrow, and what we hate today will catch up with
what we love tomorrow. |

The most precious reward during life is to busy yourself
with the most suitable and useful matters in their exact
and suitable time.

How can he be rational who sells Paradise and what is
in it, for one hour of passing pleasure?

The Pious man will leave this worldly life while he did
not obtain satisfaction in two matters: crying for himself
and praising Allah.

If you are afraid of any creature, you will run away from
it. When you are afraid of Allah, you will love Him and
seek to be close to Him.

If knowledge is useful without actions, Allah, the Exalted
would never have dispraised the people of the book,
and if actions were useful without devotion, He would
never have dispraised the hypocrites.

Stand firm against evil thoughts, for if you fail to do so,
they will become ideas, if you do not, they will become
desires, so fight against them. If you do not, they will
become a form of determination and intention, if you do

56 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

not resist, they will become actions, and if you do not
follow them up with their opposite, they will become
habits that will be hard to quit.

e Piety has Three Levels

One: protecting the heart and limbs against sin and
forbidden actions.

Two: protecting them against undesirable matters.

Three: protection against curiosity and whatever is not
of one's concern.

The first will grant life to the servant, the second will
grant him health and power, and the third will grant him
happiness and joy.

٠ He whom Allah has predestined to enter Paradise, the
reasons, which will cause his entrance shall spring from
calamities; and he whom Allah has predestined to enter
the Hellfire, the reasons which will cause his entrance
shall spring from lusts.

٠ When Adam (Adam, peace be upon him) sought
immortality in Paradise by means of eating from the
forbidden tree, he was punished by having to leave,
and when Yusuf (Joseph, peace be upon him) sought to
get out of the prison by means of one of the two
prisoners who had the vision, he remained in it for
several years.

Reactions to Undesirable Destiny

lf the servant experiences something that he hates, he should
adopt six views:

One: to acknowledge monotheism. The Will of Allah should
be done, and whatever He does not wish should never be
done.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 57

Two: to believe in the justice of Allah, and that the judgment of
Allah is to be done and His judgment is just.

Three: to believe in mercy: that His mercy concerning this
destiny will prevail more than His anger and vengeance.

Four: to believe in wisdom and that all destiny is according to
His wisdom. He did not predestine anything without reason.

Five: to praise Allah. Indeed, to Allah all perfect praise is due.

Six: to be servants of Allah. The person is a mere servant of
Allah. The orders and judgments of His Lord are to be done to
him as he is His servant. He ts under the authority and
judgments of Allah as well as His religious judgments.

Consequences of Committing Sins

Lack of success, invalid views, absence of righteousness,
corruption of the heart, failing to praise Allah, wasting time,
avoidance of other creations, separation between the servant
and his Lord, supplications not being answered, constriction of
the heart, decaying of blessings in subsistence and age,
prevention of attaining knowledge, humiliation, insults from
enemies, a constricted breast, evil friends that will spoil one's
heart and waste time, sadness and grief, a miserable life, and
disappointment. All that results from sins and neglecting to
praise Allah, as plants grow by being watered but are
consumed _ by fire. The opposite of the above’ are the
consequences of obedience to Allah, the Almighty.

Chapter on the Rights of Allah

The one who is just toward Allah will find true happiness. This
is the same one who admits that he is ignorant, that his deeds
are defective and that he himself is insufficient, and that he
continually fails to give Allah His rights as He deserves. If Allah
punishes him for his sins, he will know that this is just, and if
such a person does a good deed, he will see it as a favor and

58 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

charity from Allah and if Allah accepts it from him, it is another
favor from Him and if He does not, it is because it is not
Suitable to be presented to Allah. If he did an evil deed, he will
see it as a result of being abandoned by Allah, and that Allah
had removed His protection from him and so he commits sins,
and this is justice. He acknowledges his need for Allah and
knows he is unjust toward himself. If Allah forgives him, it
would be a generous favor from Him. The whole issue depends
upon seeing Allah as the Well-Doer and seeing himself as the
sinner and neglectful person. When something pleases him, he
sees it as a favor from Allah and that it is He, who grants it to
him, and whenever something displeases him, he knows that it
is because of his sins and that Allah is being just toward him in
every matter.

When the house of lovers are destroyed, they invoke Allah that
the dwellers be able to return and find peace and goodness.
When someone who loves Allah has stayed under the dust for
several years, he would remember his obedience to Allah in
this worldly life and would find the good he obtained.

A Precious Gem: Two Kinds of Jealousy

There are two kinds of jealousy: to be jealous for something
and to be jealous of something. Being jealous for your lover
means that you care for him/her and you do not want anything
to come between that person and yourself or to compete with
you. The feeling of jealousy for the lover always comes with
the feeling of being jealous of whatever is in competition with
you. The first kind of jealousy is praised, as the lover dislikes
having partners in their love. This feeling is more likeable in
loving the Messenger and the scholars, and even more likeable
in loving the one, who most deserves our love, the Exalted! The
idea of not wanting to have another compete with him/her in
their love is envy. The desirable form of jealousy on His
behalf is when the lover is jealous of his/her love for Him from

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 59

being turned away to another one. Also, not wanting it to be
known by others, thinking that others will spoil it, being jealous
that his/her deeds may stem from parts that are not for his/her
love, or being jealous because of hypocrisy. As a whole,
jealousy requires that his/her condition, deeds, and actions ‏أله‎
‎be for the sake of Allah. To be jealous that his/ner time will be
wasted in doing something else other than pleasing Allah is the
state of the lover. This jealousy comes from the side of the
servant and it is being jealous of his/ner competitor who hinders
and prevents the pleasure of his/her lover, the Exalted. While
His lover, the Exalted is jealous for him/her through hating that
the servant's heart should turn away from loving Him to love
other than Him. That is why the jealousy of Allah is when the
servant does whatever is forbidden. And out of His jealousy, He
forbade shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse, etc. whether
committed openly or secretly. Because all mankind is His and
He is jealous for them exactly as a master is jealous for his
slaves. Allah is jealous for His servants to love other than Him
in case this love will sour them on to commit sins.

e The person whose love and reverence for Allah in his
heart prevents him from disobeying Him, Allah will
venerate him in the hearts of creatures so that they will
not humiliate him.

e lf the roots of knowledge hold onto the heart, the tree of
love will grow in it and if it becomes stronger it will bear
the fruits of obedience and it will keep on giving its fruit
at all times by the Leave of its Lord.

e The first ranks among people are those who do as Allah
says,

4 By ‏وَأصيلاً‎ FR ‏وَسَبْحُوهُ‎ GD LS Bo AT ys.

which means, "Remember Allah with much
remembrance. And glorify His Praises morning and

afternoon [the early morning (Faj) and ‘Asr prayers].”
(Al-Ahzab, 33:41-42)

The middle rank is as Allah says,
4 ... ‏الظلمسب إلى النور‎ Ge Re pel Kaley ‏عَلَيكمَ‎ Sar ‏الى‎ 52 >

which means, "He it is Who sends Salat (His blessings)
on you, and His angels too (ask Allah to bless and
forgive you), that He may bring you out from darkness
(of disbelief and polytheism) into light (of Belief and
Islamic Monotheism)." (Al-Ahzab, 33:43)

The lowest rank is as Allah says,
4 Dy ‏يَوْمْ يلقوته سلدم‎ HS («

which means, "Their greeting on the Day they shall meet
Him will be "Salam: Peace (i.e. the angels will say to
them: Salamu ‘Alaikum)!" (Al-Ahzab, 33:44)

e The land of nature is wide and accepts whatever is
going to be planted in it. If you plant a tree of faith and
piety, it will give the sweetness of the Hereafter and if
you plant a tree of ignorance and desire, it will give bitter.
fruit.

Return to Allah and seek Him in your eye, ear, heart, and
tongue and do not forget to seek Him in these four ways.
Whoever obeys Him is doing so concerning these four and
whoever does not, is also doing so by means of these four.
The fortunate one is he who hears, sees, speaks, and attacks
while seeking the pleasure of Allah and the miserable one is the
one who does so seeking his own pleasure and desires.

The example of obedience that grows and increases, is like a
seed that you plant, which becomes a tree, then bears fruit,
and you ate this fruit and planted their seeds again and

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 61

whenever the tree bears fruit you eat it and plant its seeds. The
exact example can be applied 16 sins and the way they
increase. There is an old proverb and the wise will understand
it. It means: the reward for good deeds is that they are
followed by other good deeds, and the punishment for bad
deeds is that they are followed by other bad deeds.

It is not strange that a servant lowers himself before Allah,
worships, and does not become bored from serving Him
because he needs Him. The strange matter is that Allah
shows’ love to His servant by all means through granting
blessings and rewards while He does not need him.

e You should keep away from committing sins as they

e Satan rejoiced when Adam (Adam, peace be upon him)

through humility to Allah. As Allah says that Adam said,

as it was and the wounded man stood up as if he had not had
any pain.

Chapter: Salman Al-Farisy

There are several means of survival and they are destined in
order to solve man’s problems. Whoever is expelled feels like
he is being tied, but when Allah wishes, destinies will be
changed and good shall come, as people ‏ع3‎ different

Magus of Asbahan. He was brought up in a village called Jiyan. He read the
books of the Persians, the Romans, and the Jews. He traveled to Arab
countries, met the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Quba' Mosque, embraced
Islam, and the Muslims helped him until he freed himself from slavery. He

Now we shall recount the story of Salman Al-Farisy, and we
should start from the beginning. We mentioned that he was a
Majian as were all his countrymen. He knew about Christianity
and converted to it. He argued with his father and beat him with
proofs so his father tied him up 385 punishment. This indeed, is
the way of the people of evil. Fir'awn (Pharaoh) responded in

the same way with Misa (Moses, peace be upon him). Allah
says that Fir’awn said

about to leave, so he fled and traveled. He accompanied them
hoping to find the truth and dedicated himself totally to serving
monks. When the monks felt that their religion was about to end
they told Salman about the signs that would prove the
prophethood of our Prophet and said that this religion was
about to appear. They advised him to follow it. Later he was
betrayed and was sold to a Jew in Medina. He waited for the
new religion, until the news came while he was climbing a palm
tree. He hurried to meet the Prophet (peace be upon him) His
master cried out to him to take care of his work but he said
how could he do so while he was busy with something else.
When he met the Messenger (peace be upon him), he
compared the two religions and embraced Islam. The Prophet
(peace be upon him) said once, "Salman is from us; (from my)
family." © Muhammad! You want Abu Talib and we want
Salman; if Abu Talib was asked about his name, he would say,
"Abdumanaf". If he was asked about his relatives, he would
say he is from a great family. If he is asked about wealth he
would mention his camels, but if Salman was asked about his
name he would say, "Abdullah", and about his relatives he
would say ‘Islam’, his wealth is poverty, his coffin is the
mosque, and what he has won is patience. His clothing is piety
and humility, his bed is staying up at night, his aim is to stand in
front of Allah, and his path leads to Paradise.

Get yourself out of this limited world of diseases to the
wide world of the Hereafter, which has what the eyes
have never seen. Nothing is impossible there, and love
is not lost. O you who sold yourself for the sake of
something that will cause you suffering and pain, and
which will also lose its beauty, you sold the most
precious item for the cheapest price, as if you neither
knew the value of the goods nor the meanness of the
price. Wait until you come to the Day of mutual loss and
gain and you will discover the injustice of this contract.
"There is no god but Allah" is something that Allah ts
buying. Its price is Paradise, and the Messenger is its
agent, and you will be pleased to part with a small part
of this worldly life to obtain it. The part you lose isa
small part of something that as a whole is not worth a
mosquito's wing.

You have a weak will and the path of life is hard. Adam
tired on this path, NGh (Noah, peace be upon him)
lamented for it, Ibrahim (Abraham peace be upon him)
was thrown into the fire because of it, Isma’il (Ishmael,
peace be upon him) was about to be slaughtered in its
cause, Yusuf (Joseph, peace be upon him) was sold for
a cheap price and was imprisoned for several years,
Zakariyah (Zachary, peace be upon him) was sawed in
half, Yahya (John, peace be upon him) was
slaughtered, Aiydb (Job, peace be upon him) suffered
distress, Dawdd (David, peace be upon him) cried, ‘Isa
(Jesus, peace be upon him) accompanied dangerous
creatures, and Muhammad, (peace be upon him)

A Precious Gem: Lessons

e Whoever lacks amiability with people and finds it in
seclusion, verily he is a truthful but feeble character and
whoever finds it with people and lacks it in seclusion,
surely he is an ailing one. Whoever lacks it both with
people and in seclusion, surely, his character is dead.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 69

And whoever finds it both in seclusion and with people,
surely he is an affectionate, truthful and strong
character. He, who finds delight in seclusion, cannot
have more delight except with seclusion, and he, who
finds delight with people by advising and guiding them,
cannot have more delight except in their company.
Finally, whoever finds delight with whatever Allah has
willed for him, more delight will be granted to him both
in seclusion and in the company of people. Thus, the
most honorable condition is to submit to the will of
Allah. The same light exists in the pure hearts that 5
found in nature, as it brightens from the laws of Allah.

e Dhul-Bijadain was an orphan boy, whose uncle took
care of him. But he was obsessed by the idea of
following the Messenger (peace be upon him). Upon his
decision to follow the Messenger, his was afflicted with
a disease, so he waited for his uncle.

When he was cured, he lost patience so he told his
uncle, "0 Uncle! | waited a long time hoping that you

which ١ granted you." He (Dhul-Bijadain) said, "Just one
look at Muhammad is preferable to me than all this
worldly life, and everything therein."

When Dhul-Bijadain decided to follow the Messenger

When he passed away, the Messenger (peace be upon
him) descended to prepare his grave by himself, and he
used to say, "O Allah! | am satisfied with him, so | beg
You to be satisfied with him." Upon that, Ibn Mas'td

e Once, some wise men saw a non-Arab horse used for

distinguished from the unfaithful, and if you were to
succeed therein, they would be turned to supporters by
which you could attain your objective.

A Precious Gem: This Life of Deception

This worldly life is like an unchaste woman, who 15 not
satisfied with one husband. So, be satisfied with whatever
Allah grants you from this worldy life.

Walking thereon is like walking in a land that is filled with
beasts, and water that teams with crocodiles. That which
causes delight, turns to be the source of grief. Pain is found in
the midst of pleasures, and delights are derived from its
sorrows. As a bird sees the wheat, so does one’s insight
perceive polytheism, while vain desires render its holder blind.

Lusts were granted in abundance to humans, but those who
believed in the unseen turned away from them, while those
who follow their lusts were caused to regret.

The first category, are those, in which Allah says,
4 22 ‏فز اولتيك على هدى من 5 وَأوْلتِيكَ هم المفلخورت‎

which means, "They are on (true) guidance from their Lord, and
they are the successful." (Al-Baqarah, 2:5)

However, the other category, are those to whom Allah says,
mm OF GY 8-5-1
*» 2( ‏كلوا وَتمتّعوأ قليلا إنكر مجرمون‎ (

which means, "(O you disbelievers)! Eat and enjoy yourselves
(in this worldly life) for a little while. Verily, you are the Mujrimun

72 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

(polytheists, disbelievers, sinners, criminals, etc.)." (Al-Mursalat,
77:46)

When the successful ones are aware of the reality of this
worldly life being sure of the inferiority of its degree, they
overcame their vain desires for the sake of the Hereafter. They
have been awakened from their heedlessness to remember
what their enemies took from them during their period of
idleness. Whenever they perceive the distant journey they must
undertake, they remember their aim, so it appears easy for
them. Whenever life becomes bitter, they remember this verse,
in which Allah says,

{ yams, “a Be 4 o? 4 te y 3 ane 8 -
* ‏انك‎ ett 9p aS ‏يومكم الزرى‎ le. «

which means, "This is your Day which you were promised." (Al-
Anbiya’, 21:103)

Chapter: A Wondrous Reality

What a wonderful thing it is to know Him (i.e. Allah)! But how
can one know Him and not love Him? How can one hear the
caller but fail to respond? How can one know the profit that
shall be gained in dealing with Him but stil prefer others? How
can one taste the bitterness of disobeying Him but still abstain
from seeking the pleasure of obeying Him? How can one feel
the severity of engaging in trivial speech, but fail to open your
heart with His remembrance? How can 06 be tortured by
being attached to others but not rush toward the bliss of turning
to Him in repentance?

Perhaps it is most Surprising to know. that while you are in
need of Him, you are still reluctant to move toward Him
because you seek others.

A Precious Gem: Sources of Unlawfulness

No one can indulge in unlawfulness except for two reasons, the
first of which is failing to trust in Allah, despite the fact that if
one obeys Him, he will surely be granted the best of lawful
gains. The second reason is knowing that whoever abandons
anything for the sake of Allah, surely He will grant him
something better than what he has abandoned. Unfortunately,
his vain desires surpass his patience and his_ inclination
overpowers his mind. The first one has poor knowledge, and
the second one has poor insight.

Yahya bin Mu'ach"® said, "He whom Allah opens his heart with
invocation, surely Allah will respond to him." | added, “but he
whom Allah opens his heart, and feels in need of Allah, and his
hope is strong, then Allah will respond to him.”

A Precious Gem: Benefits

e When those, who are vigilant observe the influence of this
worldly life upon those who seek it, the deceit of false
hopes, the control of Satan, the domination of souls, and
material fortune in the hands of evil ones, they resort to
piety and submission, like a scared slave who seeks refuge
in his master's house. The desires directed at this worldly
life are simply deceptive enjoyment, and the insight of the
ignorant is restricted to superficial matters, while the wise
man perceives that which is hidden from the others.

e Once, two foxes were caught. While trapped in the net, one
of them asked the other where he could meet him
afterwards, and the other one replied that they would meet
after two days in the tannery.

19 He is called Yahyd bin Mu'adh bin Ja'far Ar-Razy Abu Zakariyya, one of the
ascetic preachers, who lived in Balakh and died in Nisapore in 258 A.H.

By Allah! This worldly life is like a dream. After waking up,
success may be one’s destiny.

Passing days are like dreams, the coming ones are wishes,
and the time separating them is wasted.

How can one feel secure, who has an unmerciful wife, an
unforgiving son, a distrusting neighbor, a friend who gives
no advice, a partner who misjudges him, an enemy whose
hostility never ceases, a soul that is inclined to evil, an
adorned world, vain desires, influential lusts, furious anger,
the deception of Satan, and controlling weakness? If Allah
rescued and guided him, all these problems would be under
conirol, and if Allah deserted and abandoned him, leaving
him on his own, all these distresses would cause his
destruction.

When the Glorious Qur'an, and the Sunnah are
abandoned, because it is thought that they are insufficient,
and when human opinions, analogy, discretion, and the
words of scholars are sought, people's natures are
corrupted, their hearts become dark, their understandings
become confused, and their minds become distorted. All
the previously mentioned matters had a great impact on
their lives to the extent that the young and the old lived
under these circumstances, thinking them to be allowed.
Alternative conditions prevailed, in which innovated matters
replaced Prophetic traditions, inclination replaced wisdom,
vain desires replaced reason, going astray replaced
guidance, the wrong replaced the good, ignorance replaced
knowledge, hypocrisy replaced devotion, the unlawful
replaced the lawful, lying substituted truthfulness, flattery
substituted advice, and injustice replaced justice, thus these
evils reigned supreme, and their holders became
privileged, despite the prevalence of their opposite in the
past, where their holders were the privileged ones. If you

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ® 75

see the superiority of such evils, and their slogans are set
up where their armies are invading, surely the bottom of the
earth would be much more desirable than its surface, the
peaks of mountains would be more preferable than the
plains, and accompanying beasts would be better than
accompanying people.

The earth trembles, the heavens have darkened, evil has
appeared on land and on sea because of the injustice of the
wicked, evil doers. Blessings have disappeared, good
deeds are less, and the beasts have become powerless,
life has become corrupted because of the wickedness of the
wrong-doers. The morning light and the night's darkness
shed tears, because of the awful deeds that are committed.
Honorable writers among the angels and others from among
them have complained to their Lord because of the
prevalence of misdeeds and the supremacy of atrocities. By
Allah! This is a warning of approaching torment, and
forthcoming afflictions, so you have no resort except sincere
repentance as long as repentance is still available. Do not
wait until there is no escape in which Allan says,

42 ‏يَنقلِبُونَ‎ la fh iti ‏الْذِينَ‎ shots... «

which means, "And those who do wrong will come to know
by what overturning they will be overturned." (Ash-Shu'ara’,
26:227)

Buy success for yourself today, for the market still exists,
and the price is affordable, and goods are low-priced, and
do not wait until the market and the goods are
inaccessible, in which Allah says,

e Insincere effort is like the traveler who fills his bag with
sand, it just overburdens him for no good reason. If you
have overburdened your heart with the grief and sorrows of
this worldly life, neglecting prayers, which are the heart's
provision and power, you would be like the traveler who
overloaded his riding animal, while depriving it of its food, so
it would not be able to continue on the journey.

٠ He who tastes the pleasure of good health, surely the
bitterness of patience will become easy for him.

e The aim has the priority in estimation, it is the last in
existence, it is the principle according to the mind, and it is
the end of the journey.

٠» You have been powerless for a long time, so if your
intention is highly elevated, the brightness of determination

e The disparity of people is based on their determination
rather than their images.

e Feeling powerless is a deceptive excuse.

٠ The difference between you and the righteous people are
the influence of vain desires, so if you want to approach the
righteous, overpower your desires. This worldly life is like a
racetrack, but the dust is overwhelming and the race cannot

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7
be seen. The people therein are either mounted or
dismounted, or the owners of slaughtered beasts.

There is evil in human nature, but enthusiasm is the best.
Greed is not overcome except in overcoming vain desires.

Being determined to reach your aim entails the exertion of
your utmost effort, and being cautious for fear of losing
hope.

The stingy person is the poor one, whose poverty !5
unrewarded.

Patience during distress is better than yielding to others.

The noble woman prefers hunger rather than immorality.
Resort to no one but your Lord, for resorting to others Is a
disgrace.

Worshipping in solitude brings about pleasure.
Resort to the eternal, but never resort to the mortal.

The solitude of the ignorant is corruption while the solitude
of the knowledgeable is fruitful.

lf wisdom and conviction are combined (in seclusion), and
deep thought is gained, a fruitful conversation will take
place.

If your enemy abuses you, do not respond to his abuse for
the result will be degradation.

Avenging oneself is not wise, for if you know the reality of
your soul, you might inadvertently help your enemy against
yourself.

If the blaze of revenge is derived from the blaze of wrath,
the wrathful will burn first.

fortune would be implanted in his heart, and then they would

its stem.

lf determination is adopted in the state of powerlessness,
which is followed by strong resolution, surely the heart will
be enlightened by the light of Allah.

When night descends, sleep and sleeplessness struggle,
fear of Allah and longing for Allah are the soldiers of
wakefulness, while idleness and delaying are the soldiers of
heediessness. If determination is adopted, and negligence
is defeated, then by the time day breaks, every party will
take his share.

A night rider undergoes hardship; in a marching army, the
cavalry come in the front, while those who carry supplies

Do not feel weary of standing by His door (i.e. Allah) even if

O you who seeks provision without piety! How can you be
satisfied with sins and still complain about your provision
being straightened?

lf your aim is piety, other aims are never missed.

Misdeeds stand as a block for earning. Surely, one can be
deprived of provision by committing sins.

Animals kept for reproduction are not on the same level as

The worker, who wants to know his degree in the master's

Be the son of the Hereafter, and do not be the son of this
worldly life, verily, the son follows his mother.

This worldly life is not worth the movement of your
footsteps thereon, so it is not wise to be misled by it.

This worldly life is like the carrion, and indeed the lion
hesitates to seize it.

This worldly life resembles a passageway, and the
Hereafter resembles the homeland, and indeed the wishes
of pious men are directed toward the homelands.

There are two kinds of meetings between friends:

The first kind is a meeting based on sociability and spending
time, in which there are more disadvantages than
advantages, the least of which is corruption of the heart,
and wasting time.

The second kind is a meeting for the sake of supporting one
another, and recommending one another to the truth and to
patience. This is the best kind, yet there are still three
disadvantages therein,

1) Flattering each other.

80 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

2) Being excessively talkative.

3) That such meetings become a habit or routine and they
fail to achieve their aims.

In general, the result of social meetings will be derived trom
the source, which is either for the soul inclined to evil, or for
the heart and the peaceful soul. If the source is good,
Surely the fruit will also be good. Pure souls derive their
nature from their Lord, while evil ones derive their nature
from the devil. Hence, Allah, the Exalted and Ever Majestic,
renders good women for good men and bad men for bad
women.

An Important Rule: There is no Power or Strength
except with Allah

In this physical world, there is no force that can influence
independently; and not only that, there is no force that has
influence on its own, unless another force is joined to it and all
that hinders its effect is gone. This is true of the forces that
can be seen. Unseen and abstract forces depend on other
forces, like the influence of the sun on animals and plants. In
the same way, having a child depends on a number of forces
other than sexual intercourse.

This is the truth of forces and their effects. Therefore, is
anything is feared or hoped for from anything in creation, it
must be remembered that the extent of its capacity is that it is a
part of a force that does not alone possess the ability to
influence. Moreover nothing possesses the ability to
independently influence anything else, without depending on
others, except Allah, the One, the Irresistible.

Therefore, we should not expect anyone or anything to benefit
us nor should we fear anyone or anything except Allah. Surely
depending on others or fearing them is worthless. If it is
supposed that it is an independent force, capable of influencing

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings *81

alone, there would still be another force from something otrer
than it. It has no ability that enables it to do anything by itse',
for there is no power or strength except with Allah.

He is the only One Who has entire power and_ strength, and
what mankind hopes and fears from the power and strength he
sees in people are in reality owned and controlled by Allah
alone. So, why should we hope for and fear that which does not
possess either power or strength? The reality is that fearing
anything in creation and hoping for it, are the causes that
deprive and afflict the person who hopes for it or fears it. This
is so according to the degree that you fear anything other than
Allah, as you will be under its influence. And you will also be
deprived according to the degree that you hope for other than
Him. This applies to all people both in the levels of knowledge
and status.

Therefore, that which Allah wills happens and that which He
does not ordain, will never happen even if all the creatures
agree upon it.

Monotheism Prevents Misfortunes

which means, “And when they embark ona ship, they invoke

Itsaves its supporters from the distress and misfortunes of this _
world and the Hereafter. That is why Ydnus resorted to it, and
Alah saved him from the darkness of the whale’s belly.

Inthe same way, the followers of the Prophets resorted to it and
by it they were saved from that which the polytheists were
tortured with in this world and that which is prepared for them in
the Hereafter.

When Firaun (Pharoah) resorted to it at the time he saw death
and he was about to drown, it was of no avail to him, because
faith is of no avail at the time when the soul witnesses the
reality. This is Allah’s way with His servants. Nothing prevents
the misfortunes of this world like Monotheism. That is why the
Supplication of distress is done with Monotheism, and as an
example of this we remember the supplication of Dhun-Ndn,
(Yanus) “° which no distressed person used to supplicate with
but Allah drove his distress away. On the other hand, nothing
Causes great distress like polytheism, and nothing saves man
from it except Monotheism. Therefore, it is the refuge and the
fortress of all creation. And truly Allah is the only One who
grants success.

A Precious Gem: Knowledge is Followed by Love

Exalted) are You [above all that (evil) they associate with You]. Truly, | have
been of the wrong-doers." (Al-Anbiya’, 21: 87)

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 83

cherished one is stronger, there is perfect pleasure. Love and
yearning follow knowing Allah and appreciating His greatness.
Whenever our knowledge of Allah is perfect, we will love Him
more perfectly. Therefore, the perfection of blessing and
pleasure in the Hereafter can be traced back to knowledge and
love.

Whoever believes in Allah, His Names and Attributes, and
knows them well, would love Him a great deal, and his feeling
of pleasure, his being close to Him, looking at His Face and
hearing His words would be complete when meeting Him on
the Day of Judgment. Every pleasure, blessing, joy and delight
would be like a drop of water compared to the sea. So how is It
that an intelligent person can prefer weak and shortlived
pleasure that is mixed with pain, to great, complete and eternal
pleasure? The perfection of man is based on these two
abilities: Knowledge and love. And the best knowledge is the
knowledge about Allah, and the highest love is the love for His
Sake. Surely, itis Allah’s help that should be sought.

A Rule: Two Restraints that Rescue

Whoever performs a deed for the sake of Allah and the
Hereafter, can only stay on the straight path by having two
restraints: to let his heart continually seek Allah’s Pleasure and
the Hereafter, and restrain it from turning to anything other than
that. And to restrain his tongue from that which ‏5ا‎ not
beneficial, and constantly remember Allah and that which
increases its faith and knowledge, and restrain his body from
committing sins and indulging in lusts, and adhering to religious
duties and recommendations. He should maintain these
restraints until he meets his Lord to free him from restraint to
enter the widest and best of places. And if he did not endure
these two restraints, and indulges in lusts and desires, he will
be punished with a horrible restraint while leaving this world.
Therefore, all those who leave this world are either freed from

84 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

this worldly restraint or are going to another kind of restraint in
the Hereafter. And it is Allah Who Grants success.

Piety

Ibn ‘Aun *' was Saying good bye to a man and said to him, “You
should fear Allah, for he who fears Allah never feels loneliness.
Zaid bin Aslam °° said, “It used to be said, “Whoever fears
Allah, people will love him even if they hated it. At-Thawry *°
said to lbn Abu Dhi’b, “If you fear Allah, He will suffice yOu

Sulaiman bin Dawid said, “We have been given the same as
that which people have been given as well as_ that which they
have not been given. And we have been taught the same as
that which people have been taught and that which they have
not. However, we have not found anything better than the fear
of Allah secretly and openly, and justice whether one is angry

A Precious Gem: Good Character is a Part of Piety

The Prophet (peace be upon him) established a relationship
between the fear of Allah and good character, becausefearing
Allah improves the relation between the servant and Allah, and
good character improves the relation between a person and
others. Therefore, fearing Allah makes it possible for Allah to
love him, and good manners makes it possible for people to
love that person.

A Precious Gem: Examples and Lessons

In order to be close to Allah and Paradise, the servant has to
observe two important things: one concerning himself, and the
other concerning people. That is to say he should pardon that
which is between him and the people, and should not let people
come between him and Allah. Therefore, he should not turn to
anyone other than the person who guided him to Allah and the
way that leads to Him.

O servant of Allah! The Companions of the Prophet (peace be
upon him) are great examples.

An Important Rule: Effect of "There is no god but
Allah" at the Time of Death

The declaration of "There is no god but Allah" at the time of
death has a great effect in expiating sins, as it is a testimony
of he who believes in it, and knows its meaning. When reciting
this declaration with certainty all his lusts come to an end. His
rebellious self softens and yields after refusal and
disobedience, proceeds after being turned away, humiliates
after having given honor, and its desires and interests are
released. This soul will go to its Lord seeking His forgiveness,
completely certain that Allah is One, as he is cleansed from all
the doubts of polytheism, and he is only concerned with the
Almighty One that he will now meet. Whatever he has done
secretly or privately has become one and he has faithfully said,
"There is no god but Allah." His heart is no longer inclined to
think of or turn to others. The whole world has been driven out
of his heart. He is about to stand in front of Allah. He is only
thinking about the Hereafter and has put the world behind him.
This faithful declaration came as the last deed of his life in order
to purify him from sins and take him to His Lord as he meets
Him with this faithful and truthful declaration. If this kind of
faithful and truthful declaration was said by him during his life,
he would have hated this worldly life and its people, escaped to
Allah, and deserted everything else other than Him. But he
declared it with a heart full of the pleasures of this life, love for
this life and seeking other than Allah. If it was as pure as at the

88 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

time of his death, it would have provoked another, more
sublime life.

We do not own ourselves! Allah owns us. He owns our souls,
our hearts are between two fingers of His that turn them
according to His wish. Our life, death, happiness, and sadness
are in His hands; our moves, silence, words , and deeds are
according to His will. If Allah gave us the power over ourselves
He would ‏عط‎ giving it to a failure, a sinner, and a wasteful
creature, and if He gave power to other than Him, He would be
giving authority to one who does not have any authority:
neither good, bad, useful, death, life, nor resurrection. If Allah
abandons us, our enemy will take authority over us and make
us prisoners. We can never dispense with Allah, and although
we need Him, we disobeyed Him and used to forget to
remember Him.

As Long as One is Living, Subsistence is Guaranteed

e Concern yourself with that which you were ordered to
take care of, and do not be concerned with something
that was guaranteed for you. Subsistence and the
moment of death are two matters whereof there is no
doubt. As long as one is living, subsistence is
guaranteed. And if Allah, according to His wisdom,
closed the way to some means, He will, according to His
mercy, open another means for you, which will be more
useful. Let us consider the state of the embryo. It
receives its nourishment, which is blood from one
means which is the naval, and when it comes out of its
mother's womb and this only means _ is closed, another
two means are opened to it, which are better and
sweeter than the first! This second means is pure and
nourishing milk. When he finished his suckling period
and these two means are closed because of weaning,
Allah opens four more perfect means; two kinds of

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 89

foods and two _ kinds of drinks. The two foods are from
animals and plants and the two drinks are from water
and milk, as well as whatever he likes from among other
pleasures. When he passes away, his four means are
closed, but Allah, the Exalted will open to him, if he was
pious, eight doors of Paradise in order to enter Paradise
from anyone of them according to his wish. So we notice
that whenever Allah, the Exalted prevents His believing
servant from something during this worldly life, He will
bestow upon him something which is better and more
useful to him. It should be noted that this is only granted
to the believers. Allah preserves His servant from low
and mean fortunes and is not pleased when = such
fortunes come to him, as He gives him a better and
more valuable one. The servant does not always
recognize the generosity of Allah, His wisdom and
kindness, nor does he always know the © significant
difference between what he was granted and what he
was protected from. He is fond of matters being decided
immediately even if they are mean, and refuses the
later ones even if they are better. If the servant could
just treat Allan justly, he would have known that the
pleasures of this world that Allah has protected him
from are better for him than those things which Allah
may have granted him from these pleasures. Allah
prevented him from some of them in order to bestow
upon him something that is better. He, the Almighty
may have allowed him to be afflicted in order to protect
him, tested to absolve him from sins, put him to death to
resurrect him, and took him out of this world so as to
Stand in front of Him and follow the path that will bring
him to Allah. Allah says,

keeping far away from the sight of people and far away
from any reproach.

Doors Leading to Hellfire and the Origin of Sin
There are three doors that lead people to Hellfire:

1. A suspicion, which causes one to doubt the religion of
Allah.

2. A desire, which causes one to prefer the pleasures of
this world more than obeying and pleasing Allah.

3. Anger, which causes aggression against Alllah’s
creatures.

There are Three Causes of Sin

1. Pride: This caused Satan to fall.
2. Avarice: This drove Adam out of Paradise.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings © 1

3. Envy: This encouraged the son of Adam to kill his
brother.

Whoever has been preserved from the evil of these three
things, would be protected against evil itself, because disbelief
stems from pride, sin stems from avarice, and injustice grows
out of envy.

The Wisdom of Allah in Creating the Human Body

Allah creates everything according to His wisdom. Every
external and internal part of man’s body has been created to
fulfill a special purpose. The eye is for seeing, the ear is for
hearing, the nose is for smelling, the tongue is for speaking, the
private parts are for marriage, the hand is for attacking, the foot
is for walking, the heart is for believing and knowing, the soul is
for loving, and the mind is for thinking, knowing the
consequences of religious and worldly matters, and preferring
all that is supposed to be preferred, and neglecting all that is
supposed to be neglected.

Whoever busies himself with other than Allah is the looser,
and even more than him is the one who busies himself with
people instead of himself.

Abu 5370 Al-Khudry (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated
that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "When the son of
Adam gets up in the morning, all the organs of his body submit
to the tongue and say, ‘Fear Allah as our condition is according
to you (i.e. our salvation or our destruction). If you are good,
we will be good and if you were bad, we will be bad.'"*° They
submitted to the tongue because it conveys what the heart
wants and it is an agent between it and the other organs.

about preserving the tongue, no.2407.

A Precious Gem: Fear Allah, follow His Orders,
and Avoid What He has Forbidden

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said _ in the following hadith,
"Fear Allah, follow His orders and avoid what He has
forbidden.” 7° In this hadith we find the interests of this worldly
life and that of the Hereafter and its pleasures, whose reward
will be gained by obeying Allah, and relieving the heart and
body. Also, abandoning pain and hard work in seeking the
pleasures of this worldly life is to be gained by following the
orders of Allah and avoiding what He has forbidden. Whoever
fears Allah will win the pleasure of the Hereafter and whoever
follows His orders and avoids what He has forbidden will find
rest from the pain and distress of this worldly life.

A Precious Gem: Sin and Debt

The Prophet (peace be upon him) referred to both sin and
debt, as sin will cause loss in the Hereafter and debt will cause
loss in this worldly life.

A Precious Gem: Fighting in the Cause of Allah
Allah, the Exalted says,

c a
aes, 1 - ‏ع لا‎ Ati \4 its 1 ِ Aes 2 0 | ‏سد قير‎ 7 ir 5

which means, “As for those who strive hard in Us (Our Cause),
We will surely guide them to Our Paths (i.e. Allah's Religion -
Islamic Monotheism). And verily, Allah is with the Muhsinun
(good doers)." (Al-'Ankabut, 29:69)

In this verse Allah made guidance dependent on fighting in His
cause. Whoever acquires the most perfect guidance among
people is the one who is better in fighting in the cause of Allah.

26 Recorded by Ibn Majah, the book of trade, chapter on being provident in
one’s way of living, no.2144.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 93

The most obligatory act among fighting is struggling against
one's vain desires, fighting one's pleasures, fighting Satan, and
fighting the world. Whoever fights these four matters seeking
Allah in doing so, He, the Almighty will guide him to the means
of gaining His pleasure, which means being granted Paradise.
And whoever neglected fighting in the cause of Allah, will miss
out on guidance to the extent that he neglected fighting in
Allah’s cause.

Al-Junaid*’ said, "Whoever strives hard against his lusts in Our
Cause by means of repentance, We will guide them to paths of
sincerity. We will never be able to fight our enemy in the outside
except when we fight our enemies within ourselves. Whoever
gains victory over himself will gain victory over his enemies
and whoever is defeated within himself will be defeated by his
enemies.

Chapter: Enmity between the Mind and
Imagination

Allah, the Exalted placed enmity between Satan and the
Angels, the mind and the imagination, and the soul prone to
evil and the heart. Allah combined all these forms of enmity
within man and provided every party with supporters. The war
between the two parties will continue until one captures the
other and subdues it. If the hearts, the minds, and the angels
win, there will be happiness, pleasure, joy, relief, and victory.
However, if the soul, imagination, and Satan win, there will be

‎sadness, worry, distress, and suppression of all that is good.
What do you think about the king (that is you) that was captured
by his enemy who dethroned, captured, imprisoned, and
prevented him from using his treasures, supplies, and slaves
and took them over. In spite of all this, this king did not move to
take revenge or ask for help. Above this king, there is another
king that is Almighty, the Conqueror, and the most Honored, so
he should ask Him. If you ask His help He will help you, if you
ask for His support He will support you, if you ask for His
protection He will take revenge for you, and if you run to Him,
He will give you authority over your enemy and subdue him. If
this captured king (human being) said that his enemy (his soul,
imagination, and Satan) tied him strongly and prevented him
from rising, running to You (Allah), and walking to Your door,
He, the Almighty just has to send some soldiers to untie him
and take him out of his prison, then he can come to His door,
otherwise he would never be able to untie himself.

‎lf he said this in order to refute the Mighty King, His message,
and accept his state with his enemy, this mighty king (Allah) will
leave him to whoever he chose to be his friend.

‎However, if he said this because he really needs Him, shows
his weakness, and humiliation, and shows that he is too weak
to walk to Allah or untie himself, it would be a blessing from
Allah to support him. If Allah helps him He would bestow
blessings on him and if He did not, He would not be unjust to
him even if he had praised Him earlier. His wisdom requires
that. When a human knows that the prison is that of Allah and
the enemy is His servant, who has no power to do anything
good nor bad, then armies of help will come to him.

‎Levels of Science

‎The highest ranks of intention in seeking knowledge is seeking
knowledge of the Qur'an and Sunnah and knowledge of the
laws. of Allah. The meanest intentions are those seeking the

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 95

answers to hypothetical questions, that is neither divine nor
real, or those who are hesitant and follow the words of others
and do not have any intention to know what is right. It is rare if
any of those obtain benefit from gaining knowledge.

The highest ranks of intention concerning ‘will’ is that intention
should be attached to love for Allah and seeking His pleasure.
The lowest is when one’s intention is based on human aims
against the aim of Allah. That is to say that the person
worships Allah according to his aim without seeking the aim of
Allah.

Corrupt Scholars

Corrupt scholars sit in front of the door to Paradise calling
people to it through some words, while they are doing deeds
that lead to Hellfire. Whenever their words call people to
Paradise, their deeds do not conform with their words. If such
words were true they would have been followed by them. They
seem to be leaders while they are really highwaymen.

lf Allah alone is your aim, then all favor and honor will be
yours but if you aim at what you will gain from Him, then favor
may not come to you as it is in His Hands. If your aim was
favor, which you would gain from Allah, then it would not come
to you. This is because it is in His Hands and a Deed of His
Deeds. If you draw nearer from Allah, all favor would be yours.
If favor was your aim, it would not come to you. If you knew
Allah and tasted the pleasure of being near Him and then you
degraded yourself to seeking favor, Allah would prevent you
from gaining it as a punishment. This way, you lost being near
Allah and gaining favor.

A Precious Gem: The Messenger's Victory

When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) tasted
victory after being constrained by the enemy, and his army
enjoyed victory, and he became eminent, all mankind was

96 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

divided into three categories: those who believed in him, those
who made peace with him, and those who were fearful of him.

When he set the best examples of endurance, to which Allah
says,

_— S 4,7 ‏و‎ yee seo a < arn
# 30... Sel ‏اؤلوا العزْم مِنَ‎ Re ‏فاصبر كما‎ }

which means, "Therefore be patient )0 Muhammad) as did the
Messengers of strong will." (Al-Ahaaf, 46:35), the outcome was
fruitful, to which Allah says,

4. asp

7... ‏...وال حرمنيت قصاص‎ ty

which means, “and for the prohibited things, there is the Law of
Equality (Qisas)." (Al-Baqarah, 2:194)

Hence, he conquered Mecca in an unprecedented way,
surrounded by the MuhajirGn (the immigrants) and the Ansar
(the supporters). He was also surrounded by various ranks of
Companions, while Jibril (Gabriel) was ascending and
descending in between the heavens and the earth. Allah made
no one conquer His sanctuary except His Messenger.

The Messenger (peace be upon him) compared the day of
conquering Mecca and the day in which Allah says,

« وَإِد يمكر بك الذِينَ كفروأ ليثبتوك أو يَقتلوك أو خرجوك ...:2: 4

which means, "And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted
against you (O Muhammad) to imprison you, or to kill you, or to
get you out." (Al-Anfal, 8:30)

to when the disbelievers drove him out the second of the two,
he entered Mecca lowering his chin to his saddle, submitting
and complying to the orders of Allah, Who had granted him

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7

victory; he was the one to whom mankind raised their heads,
and to whom kings surrendered.

He entered Mecca victorious, supported and a conqueror, and
Bilal mounted the Ka'bah, after having been tortured in its
precincts. In a high voice, he recited the Adhan (the call for
prayer), where all tribes came answering him from every place,
entering the religion of Allah in crowds, while before they used
to come individually.

When the Messenger (peace be upon him) ascended the pillar
of glory, from which he never descended, all kings surrendered
to him, and amongst them were those who granted him
rulership in their countries, and others asked for peace and
reconciliation, and those who consented to pay tribute,
however, the fourth category gathered to be ready for war, as
they were unaware of the fact that they were just gathering the
booty and the prisoners of war to him.

Thus, when the Messenger's victory became obvious, along
with conveying his message, and fulfilling his mission. Allah
revealed to him,

Muhammad) against your enemies) and the conquest (of
Mecca), And you see that the people enter Allah's religion
(Islam) in crowds." (Al-Fath, 110: 1-2)

After revealing these verses, the Angel of death descended
upon the Messenger (peace be upon him) enabling him to
choose between his rank in this worldly life and meeting his
Lord, to which he chose the meeting with his Lord, for which he
was longing. On that day, paradise was adorned for the
honorable soul (of Muhammad), more than the celebrations for
any king on his arrival to his homeland.

lf the throne of the Beneficent shook due to the death of one of
the Messenger's followers and rejoicing at his arrival, then what
would be the case with the death of the best of all creatures. O
you who are associated with this trivial worldly life, and are
standing by another door, surely you will discover which secret
will be yours on the day of gathering, in which Allah says,

which means, "The Day when all the secrets (deeds, prayers,
fasting, etc.) will be examined (as to their truth)." (At-Taria,
86:9)

Chapter: The Vanity of False Hopes

O you who are deceived by false hopes! Satan was cursed and
descended from the glorious abode by neglecting one
prostration he was ordered to perform. Adam descended from
Paradise because of a mouthful he ate. The criminal was
separated by a handful of blood. Moreover, the adulterer is
supposed to be killed in the most awful way because he
committed an unlawful act. Flogging is enjoined on him who

Hellfire because of only one sin.

‎A woman was cast into Hellfire because of a cat.*° One may

be done without thinking about the gravity of the word, and
then because of that he will be thrown into the Hellfire, like

obey Allah for sixty years, and at his death he misjudges,
and this will be the reason for his being thrown into Hellfire.
The person’s lifetime is judged by its end, and man’s actions
are regarded by their final deeds. Whoever breaks his
ablution before the final salutation, surely his prayer
becomes invalid, and whoever breaks his fast before
sunset, surely his fast is invalid, and whoever is sinful at the
end of his life, surely he will meet Allah in that state. If you
give charity, surely you will find the blessing thereof, but
beware of greed. How many times do you seek a good
reward but it is rejected because of procrastination?

Chapter: Why Was Adam Considered the Last of
Creatures?

The pen is considered the first thing to record the destiny of
man before his existence. However, Adam is the last of
creatures, due to several reasons:

One: Preparing the place before the dweller's arrival.

Two: Adam is the aim for which every other being is created,
like the heavens, the earth, the sun, the moon, and the sea.

Three: The most proficient Creator ended His work with the
best the same as He starts with its basis and origin.

Four: Souls usually aspire to the end and final stages, and that
is why Musa (Moses) told the sorcerers in the Qur'anic verse in
which Allah says,

جر ‎2g 8 Ea a‏ سا ‎pom,‏
‏..القوا ما انتم ملقورت 20 ©

which means, "Cast down what you want to cast!" (Ydnus,
10:80)

So when the people saw the sorcerers’ actions, they inclined to
the following one.

Five: Allah, the Exalted and Ever Majestic, adjourned the best
of books, prophets, and nations to the latest period of time. He
renders the Hereafter better than this worldly life, and the final
Stages to be more perfect than the earlier ones, and that is
why there is a great difference between the Angel's saying,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 1

"Read," to which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “I am
not a reader," and Allah’s saying,

which means, "This day, | have perfected your religion for you.”
(Al-Ma'idah, 5:3)

Six: Allah, the Exalted, gave the knowledge of all things to
Adam.

Seven: Adam is the essence and fruit of existence, so it iS
correct that he is the last of all the entities.

Eight: Because Adam is honorable in the Sight of Allah, He
prepared all his interests, requirements, necessities and means
of life for him. As soon as he was created, he found the
universe ready for him.

Nine: Allah, the Exalted, willed that His honor and grace would
be manifested over other creatures, so He preceded their
creation, and that is why the Angels said, "Even if Allah creates
whatever He wills, no creatures will be more honorable to Him
than us." Thus, when He created Adam and He commanded
them to prostrate themselves before him, the honor and grace
of Allah were manifested thereon by His knowledge, however,
when Adam committed the sin, the Angels thought that the
honor (bestowed upon Adam) was annulled, disregarding the
fact that repentance is an act of worship. When Adam turned to
Allah in repentance, performing that act of worship, the Angels
knew that there is a secret in Allah's creation, which is known to
no one but Him, the Almighty.

Ten: When Allah, the Exalted, started the creation of the world
with the pen, it was magnificent to finalize His creation with the
human being. Verily, the pen is the tool of knowledge, and the
human is the knowledgeable entity. Accordingly, Allah

102 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

manifested the honor of Adam over the angels by virtue of the
knowledge bestowed upon him.

Satan's State with Adam

We contemplate the way in which Allah, the Exalted, has written
the reason beyond Adam's descent on earth, wherein He
preferred and honored him, as well as that He mentioned his
name before his existence by saying,

2D... aids ‏الْأَرَض‎ gles ‏...لني‎

which means, "Verily, | am going to place (mankind)
generations after generations on earth." (Al-Baqarah, 2:30)

We find that Allah described Adam as His vicegerent on earth
before his existence, and He made the reason for his descent,
by saying, "on earth." The lover used to excuse the beloved
before committing his sin, so when Allah created Adam, He
placed him in front of the gate of Paradise for forty years,
because the lover used to stand by the beloved's door.
Subsequently, Allah ordained subservience upon Adam,

7 1 ‏عم‎ 72 3 7 2
4 (0 07 ‘Ger ٠ aes os)
N Net “ “ 3

which means, "He was nothing." ‏,مقكصاءلق)‎ 76:1), in order not to
feel haughty on the day in which Allah says, "Prostrate."
However, Satan used to pass by Adam's body wondering, "You
have been created for a certain reason." Then he used to enter
Adam's body through his mouth and he used to come out
through his back, saying, "If ! empowered you, surely | would
destroy you, but if you were to empower me, surely | would
disobey you." Therein, Satan was ignorant about the fact that
his destruction was at the hands of Adam. According to Satan,
Adam was just pieces of clay combined together, which he
despised.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 103

When the clay was shaped, envy obsessed Satan, and when
Adam received his soul, the envier was shocked. Adam was
granted glory, and the creatures were presented to him. The
angels were the plaintiffs and protested with Allah, the Judge
while Adam was the attorney. The angels admitted and
regretted what they had said earlier. Allah ordered them to bow
to Adam, so they did and said that they did not know. Satan
stood away and did not bow because it is evil and was covered
by the color of evil and protest and its evil will never be purified.

O Adam! If you have been forgiven for the mouthful you ate,
those who envy would have said, "How can one who fulfills his
desires like you, who has no patience, be preferred by Allah?”
O Adam! Your descent on earth was the reason beyond the
ascent of supplications, and the (divine) messages in which
Allah says, "Are there any supplicants (to whom | shall
respond)?...". as well as the blessings of Allah that are
bestowed upon those who are fasting, which is a fact which was
included in the Prophetic tradition which starts by saying, "The
smell coming out from the mouth of a fasting person..."""

O Adam! Your laughter in Paradise is yours, while your weeping
in this worldly life is ours.

How can the one who submitted to Allah be harmed, while My
Grace blesses him? Glory is compatible to him whose body 5
submissive. | am with them whose hearts are submissive to Me.
However, sins are _ still overwhelming, until they affect the
hearts, wherein the remedy was sent by the Most Kind and
Courteous (to His slaves), All-Aware (of everything), illustrated
by His Messengers. Allah says,

0Narrated by Al-Bukhary in his Book, "Fasting", Chapter of the Merits of
Fasting, no. 1894, narrated by Abu Hurairah in these words, "The smell
coming out from the mouth of a fasting person is better in the sight of Allah
than the smell of musk."

which means, " Then if there comes to you guidance from Me.

Thus, the Messengers protected mankind by (divine)
prohibitions, preserved their strength by Allah's
commandments, and got rid of misdeeds by means of
repentance, wherein righteousness was spread everywhere.

transgressed in his illness without a shield, and who has no

for illness will cause corruption. If you were to follow the divine
remedy so as to cure yourself, by having a shield from vain
desires and lusts, you will have found salvation. Unfortunately,
lusts blind your insight, to the extent that you think salvation
means to abandon the promise of Allah in return for vain
desires. What blind insight you have! It makes you impatient
for one hour then you bear disgrace forever. You travel
seeking this worldly life despite its transient nature, and you
neglect to prepare for your journey to the Hereafter despite its
eternity.

committed on purpose, nor was done out of underestimating
the wisdom of Allah, He taught him the way of turning to
Him in repentance. Allah, the Exalted, says,

a ‏سا‎ “7 a 7 ad ‏ل اتير‎ - 7 fe 7 5
Nee Be 5 > 2 oo 2 2

which means, "Then Adam received from his Lord Words.
And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance)." (Al-
Bagarah, 2:37)

By committing sins, the servant of Allah does not aim to
disobey his Lord or to violate his prohibitions, but it was the
result of an evil nature, the deceit of the soul and Satan, the
strength of vain desires, and believing that one will be
forgiven, however, according to Allah, the aim of committing
sins is the reason behind passing judgments, manifesting
the dignity of the Lord, and the submission of the servants,
and their complete need for Allah. As well as this, the
existence of the Attributes of Allah, like the Oft-Pardoning,
the Oft-Forgiving, and the One Who accepts repentance,
and the Clement to the repentant and remorseful. On the
other hand, Allah is the Avenger, the Just, and the One with
the Strongest Grasp on those who _ insist on disobeying.
He, the Exalted, wants His servant to perceive His
Perfection, and to feel absolute need of his Lord, moreover,
He wants His servant to see the Perfection of His Power,
Glory, Forgiveness, Mercy, and Patience, and that His
Mercy is nothing but beneficence, for if Allah does not
bestow His Mercy upon him, surely he will be destroyed.
Estimating guilt by Allah has a great wisdom in it and a lot of
benefit and mercy for that servant by offering him the way of
repentance.

Glorified be Allah! Paradise has been adorned for its suitors;
they exerted the utmost effort to attain the dowry. The
sincere believers know Allah, the Exalted, by His Names

Resurrection, while you are still obsessed with vain desires.

Knowledge resembles a carpet on which no one treads

Loving Allah resembles a brook in a desert with no

lover usually wants to be isolated with his lover in privacy
in order to find delight, the same as the whale resorts to
water, anda child seeks his mother.

The worshipper has no resort except under the shade of
Taba (i.e. a tree in paradise), and the sincere servant of

do your best during your lifetime and it will suffice you in

Chapter: The Manifestation of the Lord

The Qur'an is the words of Allah and He, the Almighty
manifested His glory to His creatures through His attributes.
When He shows His Greatness and Majesty, His creatures will
submit and pride will melt away like salt in water. He manifests
His attributes of beauty and perfection, which are the perfection
of His names and the beauty of His deeds, which shows the
perfection of His self. So the servant will love Him and his heart
will be empty from any love other than love for Allah. And if the
other wanted him to end this love, his heart and body will
refuse. This love will remain as his innate nature and it is not
artificial.

lf Allah manifests His glory in the attributes of mercy, charity,
and kindness, then the power of hope will emit from the servant
and he will show his wish and resort to Allah and the more his
hope increases the more he will work hard. It is exactly like the
one who sows’ seeds in his land. The more his greed
increases. in what he will harvest, the more he will sow. the
seeds, but if his hope is weak, he will become stingy and
careless in sowing them.

lf Allah shows Himself through His attributes of justice,
revenge, anger, wrath, and punishment, the evil soul will be
repressed, stooped, and its power will be weakened from
imagination, anger, and lust, and it will be afraid.

110 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

If He shows Himself through His attributes of commanding,
forbidding, sending Messengers, revealing Books, and setting
decrees, then the ability to obey, report, and follow these
orders will be shown. People will follow His orders and will
avoid whatever He has forbidden.

If He manifests Himself through His attributes of listening,
seeing, and knowing, then the servant will be shy. He will be
ashamed that his Lord sees and listens to him, as he does not
want Him to see him doing what He hates, hear what He hates
or hide what He hates. His thoughts, words and deeds _ will
remain balanced according to the law of Islam not according to
imagination and nature.

If Allah manifested Himself through His attributes of sufficiency,
managing His servants’ interests, insuring their subsistence,
preventing distress, and supporting, protecting and
accompanying His pious people, then the servant will show the
ability to put his trust in Allah, be committed to Him, and will
be satisfied with that and with all that Allah destined for him.

lf He shows His attributes of glory and pride, the good soul will
show humility to His power, submission to His pride, and his
heart and limbs will submit to Him and all recklessness will
vanish.

The essence of this is that Allah, the Exalted knows His
servant through His attributes of both divinity and lordship. The
attributes of Divinity provoke special love, longing to meet
Allan, and pleasing Him by obeying, and remembering Him.
And the attributes of the lordship of Allah induce trust in Him,
resorting to Him, asking for His support, and showing humility
and submission to Him. Perfection is when the servant knows
the divinity and the lordship of Allah. It is also to see His power
in His forgiveness, His wisdom in His Divine decree, His
blessing in affliction, giving in preventing, justice in revenge,
generosity in forgiveness, wisdom and blessing in commanding

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 111

and forbidding, glory in anger and pleasure, patience in giving
chances, generosity in advancing, and sufficiency in what He
has forbidden. If you carefully consider the Qur'an without any
distortion or evil opinions you will see a dominating king over
the Heavens, who manages His servants’ affairs, sends
Messengers, Books, and sometimes He is angry, or pleased,
sometimes He rewards or punishes, sometimes He gives or
prevents, sometimes He humiliates or honors, sometimes He
lowers or raises, and sometimes He sees and hears from above
the seven Heavens, and knows what is kept secret and what is
broadcast. A leaf does not fall, nothing moves, and no one
intercedes in His presence without His permission.

Chapter: The Merits of Abu Bakr

When the Messenger (peace be upon him) took the pledge of
allegiance from the people of ‘Aqabah, he ordered his
Companions to immigrate to Medina. Quraish knew that his
Companions had increased in number and that they would
protect him, so they began to look for the solution. Some
among them supported the idea of prison, others suggested
banishment, and at the last they all agreed upon killing him. But
Allah inspired His Messenger and ordered him to leave his
bed and ‘Aly slept in his place while Abu Bakr accompanied the
Prophet (peace be upon him) on his journey. When they left
the houses of Mecca, Abu Bakr feared for the Messenger
(peace be upon him), so sometimes he walked in front of him
and at other times he walked behind him. When he felt that the
enemy might come from the sides, he sometimes walked on
his right side and then went to his left side. until they reached
the cave of Thawr. Abu Bakr insisted to be the first to enter the
cave in case there was something harmful in it. And Allah
placed a tree there that had not been there before. This tree
cast a shadow over the cave and distracted the disbelievers
from seeing them. Also, Allah sent a spider that spun its web
around door of the cave, which misled the disbelievers and

112 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

their guide. Allah also sent two pigeons that built a nest and it
seemed to the onlooker that they had been there for a long
time. All these things were miracles and were more than just
resisting the enemy with soldiers.

When the disbelievers stood outside the cave and their talk
was heard by the Prophet and his companion, Abu Bakr said,
"0 Messenger of Allah! If any of them should look under his
feet, he would see us.' The Prophet (peace be upon him)
replied, 0 Abu Bakr! What do you think of two (persons) the
third of whom is Allah?""*' When the Prophet (peace be upon
him) saw the sadness of Abu Bakr and his fear for the
Messenger and none_ for himself, he consoled him and said
what Allah says,
> 20... ‏مَعَنا‎ hl ‏...لا غَرّنَ إن‎

which means, "Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allah is with us."
(At-Tawbah, 9:40)

Abu Bakr accompanied the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon
him) throughout his lifetime and when the Messenger died, he
became his successor and used to be called the caliph of the
Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and when Abu Bakr
died, his successors used to be called the Emir of the believers.

They stayed in the cave for three days, then they left it, and
continued their journey until Suraqah bin Malik followed them
and when he was about to catch them, the Messenger of Allah
(peace be upon him) invoked Allah against him, and his horse
stumbled. When he realized that he would never be able to
arrest them he offered them money to let him go in peace. He

offered money to someone who had refused the keys of the
treasures of the earth; he offered food to the one who is
satisfied. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “My Lord
gives me food and drink during my sleep." Abu Bakr was the
second to embrace Islam, to sacrifice himself, to live an ascetic
lifestyle, to accompany him, to take over the caliphate, and
they were both of like age, and both he and the prophet (peace
be upon him) died due to the effects of poison.

Those who embraced Islam through him were among the ten
and they are ‘Uthman, Talhah, Az-Zubair, ‘Abdur-Rahman bin
‘Awf, and Sa'd bin Abu Wagqqas. During the time that he
embraced Islam, he had _ forty thousand dirhams, which he
spent seeking the pleasure of Allah.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "| never benefited trom
any money as | benefited from the money of Abu Bakr."** He is
better than the believing man of Fir'awn (Pharaoh), as he hid
his Islam while Abu Bakr declared it openly. He is better than
the believing man of Al Yasin, as he fought in the cause of Allah
for one hour while Abu Bakr did for several years. Although Abu
Bakr was a poor man, he loved to spend his money for the
sake of Allah, following the verse in which Allah says,

The Qur'an and history mention his virtues and the MuhAjirin

Who was the last to lead him in performing prayer? Who
was the next after him to die and be laid next to him?
The answer to all these questions, is Abu Bakr. He was
very understanding and attentive during the days of
apostasy and obtained legal opinion from the Qur'an
and Sunnah.

e He protected the Messenger with everything at his
disposal. He accompanied the Prophet (peace be upon

Beware of the one who is an enemy to the people of the

doom of many creatures: he who keeps away from
Allah and acts ‏6ه‎ his suspicions, and he who_ is
fascinated by this worldly life and the power he has
obtained.

Whoever was granted some kind of special power and
readiness, will find his pleasure in using it in this worldly
life. Whoever was granted the power to have sexual
intercourse, will find his pleasure in utilizing this power,
whoever was granted the power to get angry, will find
pleasure in using his anger to get what he wants,
whoever was granted the power of eating and drinking,
will find pleasure in using his power, whoever was
granted the power to gain knowledge, will find pleasure
in using this power, and whoever was granted the
power to love Allah and turn to Him, he will find his
pleasure in using this power to gain closeness to Allah.

Pleasures other than those will be less significant and

rare.

e O You unarmed, having no good deeds in your account
with Allah, beware of the sight of a pious man for he
can see your defects from behind a veil. The Prophet
(peace be upon him) said, “Beware of the insight of a
believer."

٠ Glory be to Allah: the soul has the pride of Satan, the
envy of Cain, the insolence and impiety of ‘Ad, the
tyranny of Thamtd, the boldness of Nimrod, the
tendency to attack violently like Fir'awn (Pharaoh), the
injustice of Qartn, the meanness of Haman, the fancy of
Bil'am*, the trickery of the people of the Sabbath-
breakers, the mutiny of Al-Walid, and the ignorance of
Abu Jahl. The soul of man also took some of the
characteristics of the animals such as the greediness of
the crow, the gluttony of a dog, the folly of a peacock,
the lowness of a scarab, the disobedience of a lizard,
the spite of a camel, the impulsive jumping of 2 cheetah,
the power of a lion, the debauchery of a mouse, the
malice of a snake, the frivolity of a monkey, the desire to
collect and store like an ant, the cunning of a fox, the
lightness of a butterfly, and the laziness of a hyena. But
through taming and fighting this soul, all these traits will
be removed, but whoever submits to these follies, — will
become their servant and his good self will not be
bought by Allah, as Allah says,

which means, "Verily, Allan has purchased of the
believers their lives." (At-Tawbah, 9:111)

Allah will never purchase any good (deed) that has not
been refined by faith for without it, the good deed
cannot enter the world of the pious worshippers of Allah.
Hand your good deeds over to the buyer (Allah) before
they are ruined through doing bad deeds. In this case
the buyer will not accept them. The buyer knew what
defects were present in this good deed before buying it,
so hand it to Him and be assured that He will never
return it.

The value of the good person is estimated according to
the buyer (Allah), and the price that will be paid for it
(Paradise) is also allotted by Him. If the buyer is Great,
then the price is significant, and whatever is sold will be
considered precious.

O you who evaluate matters, do you know the value of
yourself? The universe was created for your sake.

O you who were fed the milk of piety and changed by
the will of Allah, all things are like a tree while you are
the fruit; a picture and you are the meaning; a shell and
you are the pearl, and buttermilk and you are the butter.

Allah says to His servant, "Whenever you want Me, ask
Me to come. Send for Me from yourself and you will find
Me near you and do not ask Me to come through
another servant, as | am more near to you than the
other."

If you knew the true value of yourself, you will never
allow yourself to be humiliated by committing sins. Satan

e Ifa lover traveled to meet his lover, his solders will ride
with him. Love will be the vanguard, hope will

together. So when he comes 10 the lover, gifts and
rewards will be given to him from every direction in order
to be examined whether he will dwell in tranquility and
this will be his destiny or he will search for whoever
bestowed them upon him.

e Their hearts were filled with good deeds and pure
feelings for Allah, and when the time of early dawn
came, these deeds were performed and by dawn they

e They walked seriously through this worldly life facing all

People emptied their hearts from whatever distracted
them, and replaced such things with love and appointed
eyes to guard and care for them.

Love is never found except in an empty and honest
place.

Know the value of what was lost and cry like someone,
who knows the value of what has passed him by.

lf the human knew the pleasure of meeting Allah and
being near Him, he would feel grief for being distant
from Him.

lf you taste the pleasure of the Hereafter, your drunken
heart would sober up.

Whoever feels that the path of performing good deeds
is long; his walk along that path will weaken.

Whoever is true to his intention, will be granted
resolution.

The human being is always discontent; if August comes,
he will long for March.

All hard work is easy for those who believe in Allah,
when they know that Allah hears them.

Whoever tastes the pleasures of the Hereafter, it would
be easy for him to leave this worldly life.

0 you who are patient! Beara little more, just a little
more remains.

lf one remembers the sweetness of meeting Allah, the
difficulty of fighting in His cause will be made easy for
him.

You will know where your house is in the Hereafter, so

lust beat you, you will be in a rank that is less than a

e It is lawful when a dog catches prey for its owner as
Allah accepts deeds that are for His sake alone, while
He refuses deeds that are done for others than Him,
like when a dog catches prey for itself and not for its

e The origin of all good and evil that is found in the
servant and all that is praised or dispraised, are from
Allah, the Donator and the Preventer. He, the Exalted
manages His servants according to these two attributes.
The true and sincere worshiper will praise Allah when
He gives to him and will turn to Allah when He prevents
him from something. Allah, the Exalted gives to him in
order to be praised and prevents him in order to be
asked. The sincere servant will always praise Allah and
ask of Him.

Allah, the Almighty says,

This is among the most honorable meanings of the Qur'an. And
similarly the believer is always with Allah and He is His helper
against himself, his fancy, and his Satan. This is what is meant
by the saying that someone is from the party of Allah and is

from among His soldiers. He is a helper of Allah against his
enemy. He fights them, hates, and makes them angry for the
sake of Allah, the Exalted. He will also be accompanied by
some of the characteristics of the angels in his war against His
enemies, while others among those who neglect this war have
none of these characteristics. The disbeliever is a helper of
satan, his soul, and his fancy against his Lord.

lon Abu Hatim mentioned that 'Ata' bin Dinar reported that 5810

enmity and polytheism." Laith said that Mujahid said, "He is

Muqatil said, "If they were to be taught the Qur'an, they will
neither be deaf not to hear it nor blind not to see it, but they
heard, saw, and believed in it. Ibn ‘Abbas said, “They were not
deaf and blind toward it but were afraid and submissive." Al-
Kalby*’ said, "They listen and see the Qur'an." Al-Farra' said.
‘When the Qur'an is being recited to them, they did not remain

the Qur'an were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating,
weeping, hearing, and seeing as they were ordered to do." Ibn
Qutaibah said, "They did not neglect the Qur'an as if they were
deaf and did not hear, and blind and did not see."

The Origin of Sin

There are three main origins of all sins, whether big and small:
the heart is attached to someone or something other than
Allah, obeying anger, power, and lust, which are poiytheism,
injustice, and adultery. To be attached to other than Allah and
claim another god with Him is polytheism, the core of obeying
one’s anger is to kill, and the core of obeying one’s lust ris to
commit adultery. That is why Allah, the Exalted combined these
three things when He says,

od

12 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

whch means, "And those who invoke not any other i/ah (god)
alcg with Allah, nor kill such life as Allah has forbidden, except
fora just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse." (Al-
Fuqan, 25:68)

Am these three are a cause and effect in each other:
poytheism induces injustice and adultery, like sincerity and
mcnotheism remove them. Allah says,

‎Sst 5‏ - .بس ‎bor‏ 4% يي ‎a a tod‏ > - ص بيو 7“ سر 6 م
® ...الك لتصّرف عنه ‎sg!‏ وَالفحخشاء إنهء من عبادنا ‎“ne aloes)‏ #

‎whch means, "Thus it was, that We might turn away from him
evi and illegal sexual intercourse. Surely, he was one of Our
chosen, guided slaves." (Ydsuf, 12:24)

‎Also injustice induces polytheism and adultery as polytheism is
the biggest injustice of all just as the highest justice is
monotheism. Justice is connected to monotheism and injustice
is Connected to polytheism. That is why Allah combined them:

‎One: Allah says,

‏م

‎on 7 ” 5‏ 224و ‎me SC 7, 7 ww‏ 0 ل ‎fie ~~ 7 ows se‏ ع ِِ احا م
‎gk 8‏ اللَهُ ‎VST‏ له إلا هو ‎KG‏ ولوأ العلم ‎CG‏ بالقسشط ...27 4

‎which means, "Allah bears witness that ‏قا‎ i/aha illa Huwa (none
has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and
those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always)
maintaining His creation in Justice."(Al-'Imran, 3:18)

‎Two: Allah says,

‏5
‏لل ب تاي 6 ”7 7

‎which means, "Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a
great Zhulm (wrong) indeed. (Luqman, 31:13)

‎And adultery induces polytheism and injustice, especially when
it 15 strong and it occurs through injustice and by using the

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ® 125

support of magic and Satan. Allah, the Exalted combined
adultery and polytheism when He says,

7 * 007 i a ee - A Tes oy te ‏ود ست رمه‎ eke 00 3 - 7 o
‏إلا زان او مشرك وَحَرّم ذ'لك‎ GaSe ‏لا يمكح إلا رَانِيَهَ أو مشركة وَالزَانِيّة لا‎ Gil ‏ف‎
‎1 00 ee ‏حب ثم‎

which means, "The adulterer marries not but an adulteress or a
Mushrikah and the adulteress none marries her except an
adulterer or a Muskrik [and that means that the man who
agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with) a Mushrikah
(female polytheist, pagan or idolatress) or a prostitute, then
surely he is either an adulterer, or a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan
or idolater, etc.) And the woman who agrees to marry (have a
sexual relation with) a Mushrik (polytheist, pagan or idolater) or
an adulterer, then she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah
(female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress, etc.)]. Such a thing is
forbidden to the believers (of Islamic Monotheism)." (An-Ndr,
24:3)

So these three lead to and result in each other. That is why
when the heart has more polytheism than monotheism, it will
be more likely to be guilty of adultery and will attach
significance to pictures and such things, instead of Allah.

Aliah says,

3 ‏سه ا ل‎ ae

وَالدين تجتنبون ‎LS‏ الاثم وَالفواحش ‎Io!‏ ما غضبوا هم

8

2 بر -

12]

which means, "So whatever you have been given is but a
passing enjoyment for this worldly life, but that which is with
Allah (Paradise) is better and more lasting for those who

126 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

believe (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) and put
their trust in their Lord (concerning all of their affairs). And those
who avoid the greater sins, and Al-Faw@hish (illegal sexual
intercourse, etc.), and when they are angry, they forgive." (Ash-
Shara, 42:36-37)

Allah informed us that what He has is better for he who believed
in Him and put his trust in Him. This is monotheism. Then He
talked about those who avoid the power of lust and after that
those who overcome the power of anger, so He combined
monotheism, chastity, and justice, which are the means of all
good.

A Precious Gem: Forms of Rejecting the Qur’an
and Uncertainty about It

Forms of rejecting the Qur'an:

One: to refuse to listen to it, have faith in it and pay attention
to it.

Two: to refuse to act according to it, abide by its lawful and
unlawful commandments, even if the person reads it and has
faith in it.

Three: to reject its arbitration and litigation according to its
principles and branches of the religion, and to believe that its
words are not meant to be indisputable, and that its proofs are
verbal and does not reach the level of real knowledge.

Fourt: to reject careful consideration of it, and fail to understand
it and learnthat which the Speaker intended.

Five: to reject seeking medication with it concerning all the
diseases of the heart, by seeking the cure of such diseases
from other than it.

All these are included in the following Qur’anic verse:

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings © 7

‎Ae oi ® Loe dare 7 .‏ ول مستي را ‎Soon‏ رادت 7
# وَقالَ الرّسول ‎Se‏ إن قؤى امخدوا ‎lam‏ القرءَان مهجورا 220 ©

‎which means, “And the Messenger (Muhammad) will say: "0
my Lord! Verily, my people deserted this Qur'an (neither
listened to it, nor acted on its laws and orders)." (Al-Furqan,
25:30)

‎This is the case with people although some rejection is less
than others.

‎Uncertainty in the hearts concerning the Quran, is sometimes
an uncertainty about whether it was really revealed by Allah or
not, and whether it is really the truth from Allah. Sometimes this
uncertainty is whether the Qur’an is Sacred or not, whether it is
the word of Allah or a part of His creation. Sometimes it is
whether the Qur’an is sufficient or not, whether it is necessary
for people or that they are in need of some things other than it,
like other reasonable things, analogies, opinions and policies.

‎Sometimes, it is about its meaning; its entirely clear meanings
or interpreting it by leaving the entirely clear meanings and
associating offensive interpretations. Sometimes, it is
concerned with the entirely clear meanings, and whether or not
they are meant to be practiced for their sake or for the sake of
interest.

‎People have such uncertainties in their hearts about the
Qur'an. You will find that every innovator in the religion has
some kind of uncertainty about the Verses that contradict his
innovation in his heart. Every dissolute oppressor has some
kind of uncertainty about the Verses that come in between him
and his will. So consider this meaning carefully, then be
pleased with that to which you are inclined.

‎A Rule: The Perfection of Oneself

‎The required perfection of oneself includes two things:

128 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

One: it should be a deep-rooted state and an indispensable part
of one’s character.

Two: it should be a character of perfection within himself.

If it is not in this way, it will not be perfection. Therefore, the
person who tries to achieve perfection should compete for it
and be sorry if he misses out on it. This is nothing else but
learning about his True Creator and Lord, without whom there
would be no righteousness, comfort and pleasure, which is only
found in learning about Him, the Almighty, and wishing to see
His countenance, and following the road that leads to Him and
His Pleasure and Dignity. This should become a deep-rooted
and indispensable state.

Apart from that, all other knowledge, will and deeds are
considered to be either that which does not benefit him and
does not perfect him, or that which prevents him from harm,
especially if tt becomes deep-rooted. In this case, it will torture
and pain him according to Its firmness within him.

The advantages that are separated from the self, such as
clothing, vehicles. residence, high rank and wealth; they are in
reality, something that is borrowed for some time, then the
Lender will take them back. By then, and according to the
degree of your attachment to these things, you will be in a state
of pain and suffering because the Lender has taken back what
He had lent you. And if they have become very dear to you,
you will feel even greater pain and regret.

Therefore, anyone who wishes to attain happiness for himself
should consider this point carefully. This is because most of
creations are making every effort to deprive themselves, their
own sufferance and regret, while thinking they are working for
their happiness and comfort. They can only obtain real pleasure
according to the degree of knowledge, love and good behavior
they acquire. And their pain and regret will be according to the
degree to which they miss these great targets. So, when they

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 129

lack these qualities, they will only have physical and mental
forces, with which they eat, drink, marry, get angry and obtain
the rest of their pleasures and the facilities of their life.

They will not receive any honor or merit, but only lowliness,
because these forces suit beasts better than people. They may
be better than them and more distinguished, in the sense that
they will be surer to bring harm upon themselves. Therefore,
you should abandon a form of perfection that is shared by
beasts, which may even surpass you in it, and which are more
competent in it than you. You should abandon it so as to attain
real perfection and there is no perfection except when Allah
grants it.

A Precious Gem: The Reward of Being Busy in the
Service of Allah

If the servant of Allah begins the day and the evening, without
having any other concern except Allah, the Almighty, He will
fulfill all his needs and relieve all his worries. He will empty the
servant's heart for the sake of His Love, his tongue will
constantly remember Him and he will have the Strength to
perform religious duties for His sake.

And if he begins the day and the evening, without having any
other concern except the life of this world, Allah, the Aimighty
will cast worry and grief into his heart. He, the Almighty will
leave him to himself, and keep his heart busy with things other
than His Love. His tongue will not remember Allah but will only
be concerned with the creation. He will use all his Strength in
things other than the sake of Allah, and he will remain busy in
the service of creation. He will work very hard in the service of
others. Just like a bellows that pumps _ itself up and then
squeezes itself to the utmost in the service of others.
Therefore, whoever refuses to submit to Allah, to obey and
love Him, will be afflicted with the servitude, love and service of
creation.

130 ٠ AL-FAWA'D: A Collection of Wise Sayings
Allah, the Almighty says in the Quran,
+ ‏هه “بدن‎ ee a en ee eal wr 02 ‏ع راس اده ابر‎

which means, “And whosoever turns away (blinds himself) from
the remembrance of the Most Beneficent (Allah) (i.e. this Qur'an
and worship of Allah), We appoint for him Shaitan (Satan devil)
to be a Qarin (an intimate companion) to him.” (Az-Zukhruf,
43:36)

Abu Sufyan bin ‘Uyaynah *” said, “You will never bring forward
any famous proverb but | will bring the likeness of it from the
Qur’An.” Thereupon someone said to him, “So where is in the
Quran “Give your fellow brother a date, and if he does not
accept it then give him a firebrand.” He then recited the
previous Quranic verse.

A Precious Gem: Elements of Knowledge

Knowledge is to transfer the image of a given thing and
establish it in the heart. And action is to transfer the theoretical
image from the heart and establish it in the world. Therefore, if
the one, which is established in the heart corresponds to the
reality, then itis true knowledge.

It is often true that some images that have no real existence
remain within oneself, and the person who has adopted it in
himself takes it to be true knowledge, whereas it has no reality.
The knowledge of most people is of this kind.

37 His full name is Sufyan bin ‘Uyaynah bin Maymtin Al-Hilaly Al-Kdfy. He was
a faithful memorizer, and the imam of the Sacred mosque of Mecca. He was
one of the leaders of the study of hadith. He died (may Allah have mercy upon
him) in 198 A. H. Adopted from Tahdhib At-Tahdhib (4\117), Tarikh Al-
Bukhary Alkabir (4\94), Aj-Jarh wat-Ta’dil (4\973), Mizanul-l’tidal (2\170) and
Siyar A’lam An-Nubala’ (8\454).

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 1

There are two kinds that conform with reality: the first one is
used to accomplish the perfection of the self by understanding
and knowing it, and that is done through knowing Allah, His
Names, Attributes, Actions, Books, Commands and what He
has forbidden.

The second one cannot make us perfect, and that is the
knowledge that is not important, and therefore does not benefit
when it is learned. The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to
seek refuge with Allah from the knowledge that is not
beneficial. And this is the case with most good knowledge,
such as astronomy, its stages, the number of its stars, its
quantities, and the knowledge of the number of mountains, their
color, their measurements and so on.

Therefore, the honor of knowledge depends on its content and
the level of its necessity, and surely that is nothing else
except knowing Allah and everything related to Him.

The flaw of knowledge is when it is not in conformity with
Allah's Will, which He loves and which pleases Him. That is
when knowledge becomes corrupted. The corruption of
knowledge occurs when people believe that something is
lawful and pleases Allah, but in reality it is not the case, or to
believe that it makes the person become closer to Allah even if
itdoes not.

The corruption of one’s intention is when deeds are not done
for the sake of Allah and the Hereafter, but done for the sake of
this worldly life. There is no way to be safe from these two
flaws concerning knowledge and deeds, except by learning that
which the Messenger (peace be upon him) brought from Allah,
the Almighty concerning knowledge, learning, seeking Allah’s
Countenance and the Hereafter along with the subject of
intention and will. Furthermore, faith and certainty bring about
beneficial knowledge and good will, and both of them cause
faith and increase it. Hence, it becomes clear that the deviation

132 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

of the majority of people from faith is due to their deviation from
beneficial knowledge and good will. And faith cannot be
completed unless it is learnt from the light of Prophethood, by
cleansing the will from the blemishes of vain desires and the
will of the man.

His knowledge would then be adopted from the light of
inspiration, his seeking of Allah’s Countenance and the
Hereafter. Therefore, this would be the best person in terms of
knowledge and action, and he would be among the leaders
who give guidance under Allah's Command and among the
successors of His Messenger in his nation.

An Important Rule: The Apparent and Hidden
Aspects of Faith

Faith has both apparent and hidden aspects. Its apparent
aspect is when it is related by the tongue and acted upon by
the body. The hidden aspect is the acknowledgment of the
heart, and its submission and love. Therefore, the apparent
aspect of faith will be of no use for someone who does not have
the hidden aspect, though his blood is spared and his wealth
and children are preserved by it. And no hidden aspect will be
of any use, unless there is no fear that it will be weakened,
coerced or in fear of being ruined. Therefore, the failure of
apparent deeds without the existence of any real prevention,
means the corruption of the hidden aspect and lack of faith. Its
deficiency refers to its deficiency of faith and intensity refers to
its intensity of faith.

Therefore, faith is the heart and core of Islam, and certainty is
the heart and core of faith. Any piece of knowledge or deed that
does not make faith and certainty stronger is abnormal, and any
faith that does not urge one to perform good deeds is abnormal.

A Precious Gem: Trust in Allah

There are two kinds of trust in Allah:

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

One is: to trust in Him concerning one’s needs and worldly
interests or for the sake of removing worldly harms and
misfortunes.

Two its: to trust in Him in order to obtain that which He loves
and what pleases Him like faith, certainty, jihad and inviting
people to Allah.

Between the two kinds, there is great excellence that cannot
be counted by anyone but Allah. So when the servant puts his
trust in Him as He should be trusted according to the second
kind, this will suffice him without the first one. And when he puts
his trust in Him according to the first kind without the second
one, it will also suffice him, but he will not have the same
blessed end. The greatest trust in Allah is that of guidance,
adhering to Monotheism, following the example of the
Messenger of Allah, and opposing the sinners and the wicked.
This is the trust of the Prophets and that of their sincere
followers.

Trusting in Allah is sometimes done out of necessity, in the
sense that the servant does not have any other choice but to
trust in Allah, like when life’s circumstances become straitened
for him, and he perceives that there is no fleeing from Allah,
and no refuge but with Him.

And at other times, trusting in Allah is voluntarily, and that is in
the existence of the means that leads to the purpose. If he
leaves the recommended means, he will be dispraised for
having done so. And if he makes use of the means and fails to
trust in Allah, he will be dispraised for having done so, for itis a
basic principle of Islam, and is mentioned in the Qur’an, and it
should be practiced.

lf the means 15 forbidden, it will be unlawful for him to make
use of it, and there will be no other way for him except to put
his trust in Allah, for putting one’s trust in Allah is the greatest
means of attaining one’s goal and removing harm. If the means

134 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

is permissible, then you must ensure that it does not weaken
your trust in Allah. If it does weaken your trust in Allah and your
heart is confused, then it would better to leave it. And if it does
not weaken it, then it would be better to engage in it, for the
Wisdom of the Most Justs requires the effect to be connected to
it.

You should never try to frustrate His Wisdom, especially when
you are seeking to submit to Him. In that case, you will have
performed the submission of the heart by putting your trust in
Allah, and the submission of the body by performing the pious
act.

To make use of the recommended means is to achieve trust in
Allah. And whoever abandons them, his trust in Allah will not be
sound. It is like using a means that leads to obtaining good
and fulfills one’s hope, so if it is not made use of, then the
person's hope would become a mere wish, and quitting it
would cause his trust to become weak.

The secret and the reality of trust in Allah is the reliance of the
heart on Allah Alone. The person who relies on Allah, and not
on any other person or thing, will not be harmed. Therefore,
trusting in Allah in word only is totally different from trusting in
Him with the heart. It is the same as repentence with the
tongue while having the intention to commit sins again, and
the repentance of the sincere heart even if the tongue has not
said anything. For the statement of the servant: “I have put my
trust in Allah” with the intention of something else in his heart is
like the statement “I have repented to Allah” with the intention of
committing sins.

The Complaint of the Ignorant

The ignorant people complain to people about Allah, and _ this
is the highest degree of ignorance, for if he had known his
Lord, he would not have complained about Him, and if he had
known the people, he would not have complained to them.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ® 135

One of the predecessors saw a man complaining to another
man about his poverty and dire necessity. He said to him, “O
you! By Allah, you have done nothing but complain about He
Who has mercy for you, to the one who has no mercy for
you.

The following verses have been mentioned about the meaning
of the previous statement of the predecessor.

When you complain to a son of Adam
verily you complain about the Most Merciful
to the one who does not pity

On the contrary, the person who is profoundly knowledgeable
about Allah complains to Allah Alone. And the most
knowledgeable person about Allah is the one who complains
about himself to Allah, and never to people. He complains
about the causes that made people do wrong to him, for he
knows the following Quranic Verses,

if!

‎leg ©‏ اصبّكم بن ‎rene‏ فبما كسبت ‎Trt!‏ ويعفوا عن ‎EWS‏ €

‎which means, “And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is
because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons
much." (As-Shura, 42:30)

‎Som”

‎which means, “Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allah,
but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself.” (An-Nisa’,
4:79)

136 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

which means, “(What is the matter with you?) When a single
disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with
one twice as great, you say: "From where does this come to
us?" Say (to them), "It is from yourselves (because of your evil
deeds)." And Allah has power over all things.” (Al-‘Imran, 3:165)

Therefore, there are three levels: the lowest one is to complain
about Allah to His creatures, the highest one is to complain
about yourself to Him and the middie one is to complain about
His creatures to Him.

A Great and Important Rule: “O you who believe!
Answer Allah (by obeying Him) and (His)
Messenger"

Allah, the Almighty said,
a de ‏و‎ nw g
Zs + 3 ‏الل يمد‎ > A 2 7 8 2 ow < Sg 7 a > ‏ير‎ eave Be 7 7 ‏عر ا‎ ١
Lopes, ‏سا‎ A 2 oe wae a 7M ‏سسا‎ te ana at
© 27 Tg ht ‏وقلبه- وانهه إليه‎ ot] ‏الله حول بيرت‎

which means, “O you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying
Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which will
give you life, and know that Allah comes in between a person
and his heart (i.e. He prevents an evil person to decide
anything). And verily to Him you shall (all) be gathered.” (Al-
Anfal, 8:24)

This Verse contains some instructions: one of them is that a
prosperous life is only attained by obeying Allah and His
Messenger (peace be upon him). Whoever has not obeyed will
not have a real life, even though he would have the bestial life,
which he shares with the animals.

The real and 0000 life, therefore, is the life of the person who
obeys Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) openly
and secretly. They are those who are really alive, even if their

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 137

bodies die. The others are dead even if they are alive
physically, for it is simply a state of the heart.

That is why the person who is most alive is the one who
perfectly obeys the call of the Messenger (peace be upon him),
in every aspect of life. Therefore, whoever missed any part of
it, has missed a part of life, and the person will have ‘life’
according to the level that he obeys the Messenger (peace be
upon him).

According to Al-Mujahid, the words "Lima yuhyikum" refer to the
truth, meaning “that which will give you life for the truth.”
According to Qatadah, they refer to the Qur'an, for it contains
life, trust, salvation and protection in this world and the
Hereafter. And according to As-Saddiy, it refers to Islam, for He
gave them life with it after having been dead due to disbelief.

According to Ibn ishaq and ‘Urwah bin Az-Zubair, and it is his
wording: “Lima yuhyikum" refers to the battle that Allah made
you powertul in after having been degraded. He made you
powertul after being weak. He protected you from your enemy
after being defeated by them. All these are expressions about
one reality, which is to perform openly and secretly that which
the Messenger (peace be upon him) brought from Allah, the
Almighty.

According to Al-Wahidy and the majority, these words refer to
jihad, which is the opinion of Ibn Ishaq and the opinion of most
knowledgeable people. According to Al-Fara’, the words mean:
when he (peace be upon him) calls you to that which revives
your standing by fighting your enemy, he means that their
Standing becomes stronger with struggle and jihad, and that if
they abandon jihad, their standing will become weaker and their
enemy will have the courage to challenge them.

| say, jihad is one of the greatest means that He avails them
with in the life of this world, and the life in the grave after death
until the Day of Resurrection and in the Hereafter. Concerning

138 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

their life in this world, truly, they will have more power and be
able to overcome their enemy by adopting jihad. The life in the
grave is mentioned by Allah, the Almighty in the following
Verse of the Qur'an,

7 ‏ماك‎ 44, 5 717 a7 ‏ا‎ ee ‏ل ع م 2 7 ص سر‎ Seg) ‏در‎ aan
4 72: ‏يُرَرَقونَ‎ Ago be TEN by! AT ‏قتلوأ فى سَبِيلٍ‎ all ‏ف وَلا تحسَين‎

which means: “Think not of those who are killed in the Way of
Allah as dead. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they
have provision.” (Al-lmran, 3:169)

The share of the Hereafter is for those who strive hard and
fight, like the martyrs, and its great delight is greater than the
share of anything in this worldly life. That is why Ibn Qutaiban
said, "Lima yuhyikum" means martyrdom. According to some
commentators, "Lima yuhyikum" means Paradise, for it is the
home of life, and itis the eternal and good life. Narrated by Abu
‘Aly Al-Jurjany.

The Quranic Verse examines all these aspects, for faith,
Islam, the Qur’an and jihad provide hearts with a good life, and
the perfect life is in Paradise. And the Messenger (peace be
upon him) is inviting man to faith and Paradise. Therefore, he Is
inviting to the life of this world and the Hereafter.

Moreover, man cannot maintain two kinds of life. One part is
the life of his body, with which he perceives that which is useful
and that which is harmful. Whenever this element of life is
weakened within him, he feels pain and weakness. That is
why the life of the patient, the sad person, the grieved, the
distressed, the feared, the poor and the debased, their life is
inferior to the person who does not suffer from these things.

The second kind of life is that of his heart and soul, with which
he can differentiate between truth and falsehood, between
transgression and righteousness, and between guidance and
being astray. He chooses the truth and leaves falsehood.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 9

Therefore, this life gives him more benefit and more ability to
distinguish between that which avails and that, which is harmful
concerning knowledge, will and deeds. And it avails him with
the power of faith, will, the love of truth, and the power of hatred
against falsehood.

His feeling, perception, love and reluctance exist according to
his share of this life. Just as the body that is full of life feels and
perceives that which is useful and that which is harmful. It also
perceives its inclination to what is useful, and it is reluctant
about what is harmful.

When the life of the heart comes to an end, its perception
ceases to exist; it even cannot perceive that which is useful or
harmful.

A man cannot live unless the angel breathes life into him in his
mothers womb, and before that he was in a state like death.
In the same way, there is no life for his spirit and heart unless
the Messenger (peace be upon him) breathes into it the
inspiration, which has been bestowed upon him.

which means, “And thus We have sent to you (O Muhammad)
Ruhan (an Inspiration, and a Mercy) of Our Command. You
knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith. But We have
made it (this Qur'an) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of
Our slaves We will.” (As-Shdara, 42:52)

Allah, the Almighty said that His Inspiration is a spirit and a
light. Therefore, life and illumination depend on the messenger,
and whoever receives the breathe of life of this angel and the
breathe of life of the Messenger (peace be upon him), then the
person has received two forms of life.

Whoever receives the breathe of life of the angel, without that
of the Messenger (peace be upon him), the person has then
received one of the two lives. Allah, the Almighty said in the
Qur'an,

َه ° 0
رم شام مص 20 درهه رار مشاعم ‎oe‏ مامه ‎eZ 211 ١‏ 1
‎a‏ س1 2 “ ‎au‏ الم 38

which means, “Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance
and disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and Faith)
and set for him a light (of Belief) whereby he can walk amongst
men, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism
and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out?” (Al-An’am,
6:122)

In this Quranic Verse, Allah, the Almighty made a connection
between light and life (knowledge and faith) for the person who
accepted Islam, just as He made a connection between death

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 141

and darkness (disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) for the
person who turns away from His Book (the Qur’an).

According to Ibn ‘Abbas and all the commentators, the meaning
of the verse is: the person was a straying disbeliever and then
Allah guided him.

This verse contains some instructions:

The first one is that: he walks among people with light, while
they are in darkness. His likeness and theirs is like some
people who lost their way when the night fell upon them, as
compared with someone else who has light and walks with it
on the road. Such a person sees it and sees that which warns
him.

The second one is that: he walks among them with his light,
and they benefit from him, due to their need of it.

The third one is that: he walks with his light on the Straight Way
on the Day of Resurrection, when the polytheists and hypocrites
will remain in the darkness of their disbelief and hypocrisy.

Allah comes in between a person and his heart (i.e. He
prevents an evil person from deciding anything).

which means, “and know that Allah comes in between a person
and his heart (i.e. He prevents an evil person from deciding

Anfal, 8:24)

What is well known about this verse is that Allah, the Almighty
comes in between the believer and disbelief, between the
disbeliever and belief, and He comes in between those who
obey Him and their disobeying Him, and between those who
disobey Him and their obeying Him. This is according to !bn
‘Abbas and the majority of the commentators.

There is another comment about the verse, which ts that Allah,
the Almighty is near to the person’s heart, and that no secret Is
hidden from Him, for He is in between him and his heart. This is
what Al-Wahidy narrated from Qatadah, and it seems that this
is the most suitable meaning, for response is originally made
by the heart. Allah, the Almighty is in between the servant and
his heart. He knows whether his heart has responded to Him or
not, and whether he has hidden that response or not.

Referring to the first statement, the point of connection is that if
you neglect to respond to Allah, then do not feel secure, for He
would not make it easy for you to respond after that. He, the
Almighty may choose to punish you for leaving it after the truth
has been made clear to you. It would then be like the following
verses,

There is another message in the verse, which is that He, the
Almighty combined the Revelation to the command to perform it
for them, which is the response, and between destiny and one’s
faith in it. So it ts like the following verses,

Cal S07

A Precious Gem: Jihad is Ordained for You

which means, "Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah) is ordained
for you (Muslims) though you dislike it, and it may be that you
dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing
which is bad for you. Allah knows but you do not know. (AI-
Baqarah, 2:216)

And He, the Exalted and ever Majestic says,

Aso

4 2: ‏كَبررا‎ VS ‏فيه‎ ON Jos Ch ‏أن تكرّهوأ‎ Lid Saya Sob... «

144 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

which means, "If you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a
thing and Allah brings through it a great deal of good." (An-
Nisa’, 4:19)

The first verse is talking about Jihad, which is the perfection of
the power of anger and righteous indignation, and the second
is about marriage, which is the perfection of the power of lust.
The servant hates to face his enemy using his power of anger
fearing for himself while this hateful matter is good for him in his
life and the next and he likes to make peace and forget about
jihad while this matter is bad for him in his life and the next.

Also, the servant sometimes dislikes a woman because of one
of her qualities while keeping her as his wife might grant him
much good that he is not aware of and sometimes he loves a
woman for one of her qualities and keeping her will bring him
much evil that he is not aware of. The human being as Allah
describes him is unjust and foolish. He should not make his
criteria of what is harmful or beneficial for himself according to
what he loves or hates, but the criteria should be what Allah
has chosen for him in the form of orders and prohibitions.

The best and most useful thing for him is to obey Allah in
secret and in public, and the worst and most harmful thing for
him is to disobey Allah either secretly or publicly. If he sincerely
obeys and worships Allah, every matter that he hates will be
good for him but if he abandons obedience and worship, every
matter that he loves will be evil and bad for him. Whoever truly
knows Allah, His names, and His attributes, will surely know
that any distress or harm that has happened to him bears
interest and benefits that his mind cannot comprehend and
may even benefit the servant in something that he hates.

if the Just Servant Knows the Truth

Generally, things that benefit mankind are found in things that
are disliked while harm is found in what man loves. We can
see clear examples in the one who is an expert in cultivating,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 145

and plants a garden and cares for the trees until they bear
fruit and then he begins to cut the leaves and branches as he
knows that this is for their good and if he leaves them in that
state, their fruit would never be good again. He grafts the trees
and clips them and cuts off the weak branches. He appears to
be harming them but actually he is seeking their benefit and
perfection. He never lets them drink as they want, but according
to schedules because it is better for their leaves and it speeds
up their growth. Then he cuts away a lot of their leaves
although they are their decoration, because this decoration
prevents the perfection of their growth. If these trees had a
mind to think as animals do, they would think that all this is
harmful and is spoiling them while actually it is for their benefit.

Loving parents do the same to their children because they
understand the benefits. Sometimes the cure for the child is
painful, but the parent will still do it and all this will be done for
the sake of mercy and pity. Perhaps the parent will perceive
some benefit for the child by not financing him, so he will not
give to him, because he knows that these are the important
causes of his decay. He also prevents him from many
pleasures in order to protect him. The most just among judges,
the most merciful among those who are merciful, and the most
learned among those who have knowledge, who is more
merciful to His servants than themselves, their fathers, and
mothers, if He allows them to be inflicted with evil, that will be
better for them than not inflicting them. If they had the chance
to choose for themselves they would never be able to benefit by
it. However, Allah, the Exalted manages their lives according to
His knowledge, wisdom, and mercy, whether they like it or not.
Only those who know and believe in His names and attributes
do not accuse Him or doubt one of His judgments but only
those who do not know His names and attributes argue with
Him about His judgments and doubt His wisdom and fail to
submit to His judgment. They even oppose it with their spoiled

146 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

minds, false opinions and unjust policies. They neither knew
their Lord nor obtain any benefit.

Whenever a servant has this knowledge, he will live in a
Paradise on earth before he enters the Paradise of the
Hereafter. He will be satisfied and pleased with his Lord and will
be satisfied with the paradise in this worldly life. The servant
. will be pleased with whatever happens to him because he
knows that it has been chosen by Allah and this is acceptance
of Allah as his Lord, Islam as his religion, and Muhammad as
his Messenger. The one who is not able to do this will never
taste the sweetness of faith. This pleasure depends upon how
much he comprehends the justice of Allah, His wisdom, mercy,
and good choice. The more he knows, the more pleasure and
Satisfaction he will have. Allah judges His servants according to
Justice, benefit, wisdom, and mercy. The Prophet (peace be
upon him) said in his famous invocation to Allah, "Whoever was
afflicted with grief and distress and says, 'Allahumma inny

the eliminator of my sorrow, the remover of my worries and
anxiety),' Allah, the Exalted and Ever-Majestic, will remove his
grief and will change his sorrow into happiness." It was said, "O

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7

Messenger of Allah! (Do) we have to learn these words?" He
said, "Yes, whoever hears them should learn them."**

"Your Decree on me is just" means every judgment including
what causes pain or is a punishment. And this judgment is
good for the believer as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said,
"By He who holds my soul in His hand, the decree of Allah on
the believer is always good for him and this is not the case with
anyone else except the believer."”°

lon Al-Qaiyim said, "| asked our sheikh, 'Did that apply in the
case of committing sins?' He said, 'Yes, with a condition.’ By
saying "with a condition", he meant that what will follow sins
are acts that Allah loves like regretting, asking for
forgiveness, being humble, crying, and etc."

A Precious Gem: Asceticism during this Worldly
Life

Seeking the Hereafter will not be complete without asceticism in
this worldly life, and asceticism during this worldly life will not be
complete without two things:

One: recognizing the transitory, mortal, decaying, mean, and
imperfect nature of this worldly life and thinking about the pain,
which it causes. Whoever seeks this worldly life with all its
pleasures, will suffer its pain and grief before gaining what he
wished, for if he ever gains it he will suffer grief and sadness
after its loosing it.

Two: knowing with certainty that the Hereafter is real and close
at hand, and knowing that it is immortal, lasting, and that it
contains pleasures and happiness, and that there is a huge
difference between it and this worldly life. It is as Allah says,

38 Mentioned above.

which means, “Although the Hereafter is better and more
lasting." (AI-A'la, 87:17)

tis perfect and its pleasures and blessings are eternal. These
are just some of its characteristics. If man understands these
two things he will prefer the next life and will neglect this
worldly life. Everyone is naturally disposed to dislike leaving
immediate benefits and present pleasures and waits for an
expected benefit and longs for the absence of pleasure unless
if he discovers the favor of the later one is more than the sooner
one and has a strong wish for what is better and higher. But if
he prefers this mortal and imperfect world it will be either
because he did not realize what is better for him or because he
did not want and long for what is better.

Each of these things indicates weakness of faith, mind, and
insight. Whoever wants this worldly life and prefers it, he either
believes that what is in the Hereafter is better and more lasting
or he does not believe in it. If he does not believe, he will be
lacking in faith but if he believes and does not prefer the
Hereafter, his mind is ill and he is choosing evil for himself.

This is a present and necessary division that the servant must
decide on. Preferring this worldly life instead of the Hereafter is
either because of lack of faith or an ill mind. These two are the
most common causes for preferring this worldly life and that is
why the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) neglected it
and his Companions kept their hearts away from it, abandoned
it, and considered it as a prison, not a paradise. If they wanted it
they would have gained all the pleasures it contained. The
keys of treasures were offered to him (peace be upon him) and
he refused and this worldly life presented all its wealth to his
companions but they still preferred the Hereafter. They knew
that life is only a crossing point and a passage that is not

lasting, just like a cloud that will soon move, and a dream that
they will soon wake up from.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "What have | to do with
this worldly life? | am exactly like a traveler who slept under
the shade ofa tree, then went and left it.""° And he (peace be
upon him) said, “This world (is so insignificant in comparison) to
the Hereafter that it is like one of you dips his finger (and while
saying this he pointed with his forefinger) in the ocean and then
he sees what has stuck to it."*' Allah, the Exalted says,

peace (i.e. Paradise, by accepting Allah's religion of Islamic
Monotheism and by doing righteous good deeds and abstaining

man to avoid it while calling for the Hereafter.

Important Rule: The Basis of Goodness

The origin of goodness is to know that whatever Allah wills,
will be and whatever He does not will, will not be. Then you will
be sure that good deeds are blessings from Allah and you will
praise Allah for them and invoke Him not to prevent you from
them. You will know that sins are punishments, so you will
invoke Him to protect you from committing sins and not to leave
you with your own doings either good or bad. Those who know
best agree that the origin of goodness is success from Allah
and that the origin of evil is the result of being deserted by
Allah. And they agree that success is when one is not
abandoned by Allah and left to his own devices. So if every
good is success from Allah and has nothing to do with the
servant, , then its key is supplication, resorting to Allah, and
sincere desire to please Him. Whenever the servant is given

156 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

this key he will be welcomed and if the servant lost this key, the
door to goodness will be closed on him.

e The Amir of the believers 'Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "!
do not care for answering my supplication, | care for the
Supplication, if you are inspired to Supplicate the
answer will come with it." According to the intention of
the servant, his determination, aim, and desire in this
matter, Allah will help and grant him success. Allah
grants help to His servants according to their intentions.
persistence, desires, and fear and also to extent to
which they avoid evil. Allah, the Exalted is the most just
of all judges and the best Knower among all those who
know. He grants success in the suitable time. He is the
All Knowing and the most Wise. Whoever Allah has
deserted, it is because he neglected to praise and
Ssupplicate to Him and whoever has been granted
success by Allah, it is because he praises, supplicates
and resorts to Allah. And the base of all that is patience,
and its place in faith is like the head in the body; if the
head is cut, the body is useless.

Cruelty and Purity of the Heart

There is no harder punishment than when the servant has a
cruel heart and moves away from Allah. Hellfire was created to
melt such cruel hearts. The most remote heart from Allah is the
cruel one. If the heart was cruel, the eye will never shed tears.
Cruelty of the heart is caused by increasing four things over
and above one's needs: excessive food, sleep, talk, and
socializing. When the body is sick, food and drink is no use to
it. Likewise when the heart is ill because of desires, advice is
useless.

e Whoever wants to purify his heart, must prefer Allah
over and above his own desires.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ® 157

The hearts that are attached to desires are far away
from Allah according to the amount of attachment. The
hearts are the vessels that hold the knowledge of the
truth, and the most beloved to Him is the one that Is
most tender, firm, and pure.

They busied their hearts with this worldly life, and if they
had busied themselves with Allah and the Hereafter,
they would think about His words and verses and would
have returned to them with the most precious wisdom
and benefits.

If the heart was fed by remembering Allan, became
satisfied by thinking about Allah, and purified from evil
and desires, it would see wonders and be inspired with
wisdom.

Not everyone among those who claim to have acquired
knowledge and wisdom, is from their people; the people
of knowledge and wisdom are those who revive their
hearts by overcoming their desires but those who
controlled their hearts and revived their desires,
knowledge and wisdom are just words on their tongues.

Your heart will be ruined from feeling secure and being
careless and will grow by remembering Allah and being
pious.

If the hearts neglect the tables (pleasures) of this worldly
life they will sit at the tables of the Hereafter among the
people of this invitation but if they are satisfied with the
tables of this worldly life they will miss the others.

Longing for Allah and the meeting with Him is like a
breeze that blows through the heart and removes the
blaze of this worldly life.

158 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

e The heart will rest and feel relief if it is settled with Allah
and it will worry and be anxious if it is settled with
people.

e It is as impossible for the love for Allah to enter the
heart that is full of love for this worldly life, as it is for a
camel to pass through the eye of a needle.

e If Allah loves His servant, He makes him for Himself,
chooses him for His love, and selects him to worship
Him. Allah will let His servant’s tongue be busy in
remembering Him and his limbs will be busy serving
Him.

e The heart gets sick as the body does and its cure is in
asking for forgiveness and protection. It also becomes
rusty like a mirror does and it is polished by
remembering Allah. The heart can also be naked like
the body and can lose its dress and decoration, which is
piety, and it can feel hungry and thirst like the body
does and its nourishment is knowledge, love, trust, and
offering service to Allah.

Precious Gems

Beware of being careless toward He who grants you life and
allows you to breathe as well as providing you with everything,
which you need.

e Whoever seeks more and more pleasures and power
from this worldly life, and fears a loss in wealth and
gains and fails to get rid of an enemy by trusting in
Allah, in His arrangements, and good choice for him,
has failed to hand ail matters over to Allah and be
satisfied with His judgments. He will not feel relief from
grief and sadness. Whoever refuses to be satisfied with
what Allah has decreed and chooses his own
arrangements, he will live in distress, pain, and in a bad

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 9

condition. Allah facilitates the way to Him for His
creatures and covers it with a curtain of decree.
Whoever is pleased with the arrangements and decree
of Allah, His choice for him and willingly submits to His
judgments, Allah will remove this curtain in order that the
heart can be close to Him and the servant can learn to
trust in Him.

Whoever puts his trust in Allah, will neither ask other
than Allah nor argue with Him, nor slacken his effort in
the way of Allah.

Whoever becomes busy with himself, will be distracted
by others, and whoever becomes busy with his Lord,
will become busy with himself.

Sincerity is what is not known by any angel to write or by
any enemy to spoil, and is that which will not spoil its
owner by being proud.

Satisfaction is when the heart submits to the judgments
of Allah.

People during this worldly life are to be punished
according to their intentions. The heart has six places to
wander about in: three are low and three are high. The
low ones are the worldly life in order to beautify itself to
him, a soul to talk to him, and an enemy to seduce him.
These are places in which evil and debased souls are
wandering. The high ones are knowledge that reveals
itself to him, a mind that guides him, and the Lord that
he worships.

Following one’s desires and having extended hope is
the core of evil. Following one’s desires blinds one from
seeing what is right, and having extended hope makes
one forget the Hereafter and prevents one from
preparing for it.

160 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

e The servant of Allah cannot be true as long as he is
flattering himself or others.

e If Allah wants good for His servant, He would make him
admit his sins and prevent him from committing other
sins, spend what he has for His sake and be ascetic in
what he has, and endure the abuse of others. If Allah
wants evil for His servant, He would do the opposite of
all that.

e High intentions wander around and get attached to three
things: gets to know an attribute that produces and
increases love and will, notices a blessing that is the
means of increasing praise and obedience, and
remembers a sin that is the means of seeking and
increasing forgiveness and submission. If one’s intention
is attached to something other than these three things it
will wander in the valleys of seduction and temptation.

e Whoever loves this worldly life, will estimate its value,
and he will make himself a slave to it, and it will
humiliate him. And whoever neglects it, will notice his
great value, and it will serve him, and it will humiliate
itself for him.

e The traveler will reach his destination if he continues on
his way, adheres to the right path, and wakes up at
night. But he who strays from the right path and sleeps
at night, how can he reach his destination?

A Precious and Valuable Gem: The (Religious)
scholar Whose Deeds are Inconsistent with his
Knowledge
The religious scholars who prefer and love this worldly life

Shall surely speak other than the truth concerning their
judgments and religious verdicts. Verily, the judgments of Allah

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 161

usually contradict the desires of people especially the rulers
and those who follow their whims, as their aims cannot be
attained except by opposing the truth.

Accordingly, if the ruler and the religious scholar seek position
and power and follow their desires, indeed they will not be
able to fulfill their aims except by deviating from the truth,
especially if there is a doubtful matter involved. The doubtfu!
matter will agree with the desires of man, and vanity will
prevail. As a result, righteousness will disappear, and truth will
vanish.

However, there is no doubtful matter in the truth, so how can
wrong doers dare to oppose it openly, assuming that they will
be able to repent afterwards. Such behavior is mentioned in a
Quranic verse in which Allah says,

« خَلَفَ مِنُ بَعْدِهِمَ ‎ELSI GL‏ الصّلؤة وَاتْبَعوأ الشبوات ‎Bo‏ 4

which means, "Then, there has succeeded them a posterity
who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salat
(prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering
them perfectly or by not offering them at their proper fixed
times, etc.] and have followed lusts." (Mariam, 19:59)

They were also mentioned in another verse, in which Allah

says,

‎ioe 0 ro 7‏ رع عو رع عم س2 ارم 7 7 مدر ر 59 رع بر دودرم

‎W‏ وَإِن يام عرض ‎Gas gle doh all ode A‏ الكتسب ان لا يقولوا على

* ‏يتقون افلا تعقلون ان‎ yd AS BSN! ‏وَالدارٌ‎ ab G ‏إلا الْحَقّ وَدَرَسُوأ‎ abl

‎which means, "Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation,
which inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the
goods of this low life (evil pleasures of this world) saying (as an

162 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

excuse): "(Everything) will be forgiven to us." And if (again) the
offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way,
they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins). Was
not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would
not say about Allah anything but the truth? And they have
studied what is in it (the Book). And the home of the Hereafter
is better for those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious). Do not you
then understand?" (Al-A'raf, 7:169)

Allah, the Exalted, informs us that those wrong doers have
chosen the goods of this low life (the evil pleasures of this
world) despite being aware of its unlawfulness. Moreover, they
say, aS an excuse, "(Everything) will be forgiven to us." And if
(again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came
their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those
sins), so they are insistent upon that, and that is the reason why
they dare to utter falsehood against Allah, assuming that the
judgment and the religion of Allah are implied therein.

Either they know the fact that the religion and the judgment of
Allah contradict their claims, or they do not know. The result is
that sometimes they utter falsehood against Allah, or else they
say what is unlawful.

On the other hand, the pious know quite well that the Hereafter
is better than this worldly life, so loving leadership and
following one’s desires would not be a temptation to them, so
they would never prefer this worldly life to the Hereafter. They
have only one path, which is abiding by the Glorious Qur'an and
the Sunnah. Besides, they seek help in patience and prayer,
think deeply about this worldly life, its transient nature and its
inferiority, and they compare it with the Hereafter, its greatness
and the fact that it is eternal.

Following one's desires can blind the heart in a way that makes
it confused between the Sunnah and innovation in religion.
Sometimes, one may be confused whether or not an action is

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 3

based on the Sunnah or on an innovation in religion. in fact,
when misunderstandings like this occur, it is the fault of
religious scholars as they prefer this worldly life and follow the
rulers, and their vain desires. They are mentioned in these
verses in which Allah says,

7 “ow 1 “~ 2 o «é 0 ‏وم ع ترم‎ 7 4 = wae 7 J ‏فار‎ tos ze L I 0 7.

‎which means, "And recite (O Muhammad) to them the story of
him to whom We gave Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses,
lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), but he threw them away, so
Shaitan (Satan) followed him up, and he became of those who
went astray. And had We willed, We would surely have
elevated him therewith but he clung to the earth and followed
his own vain desire. So his description is the description of a
dog: if you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or if you
leave him alone, he (still) lolls his tongue out." (Al-A'raf, 7:175-
176)

‎So, this is the likeness of the devious scholar of religion whose
deeds contradict his knowledge.

‎The previous verses dispraised this behavior as follows:

‎One: He has gone astray after having been knowledgeable,
and he has knowingly chosen disbelief over faith.

‎Two: He abandoned faith entirely with no return, so, he threw
away the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.), like the serpent which throws away its skin.

164 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

So, if there was any remnant thereof, he could not throw it
away.

Three: Satan controlled him and so he tempted and seduced
him, and that is why Allah says, "So Satan followed him up,"
and He did not say, "pursue him", because following up means
reaching and attaining him, which is much more eloquent than
saying, "pursue him," as far as meaning and expression are
concerned.

Four: He has erred after having been guided, which means
that he has gone astray in knowledge and in intention, which is
related to the corruption of his intention and deeds. Going
astray is related to the corruption of knowledge and belief, and
the corruption of one side entails the corruption of the other.

Five: If Allah, the Exalted, had so willed, He could have
elevated him with knowledge, which would have prevented his
destruction. In other words, if he was not knowledgeable, it
would have been much better for him, and would have meant a
lesser torment for him.

Six: Allah, the Exalted, informed us about his wicked intention,
mentioning that he has preferred inferiority rather than the most
honorable and the most righteous.

Seven: His inferior choice was not chosen because of an idea
that crossed his mind, on the contrary, it was chosen due to his
desire to cling to the earth. Clinging means permanent
adherence, as if it was said, "He is sticking to the earth." The
Qur'anic expression described his inclination to this worldly life
by referring to his clinging to the earth, because the worldly life
is the earth, and those who are living therein, and everything
that can be extracted thereof, either for adornment or
enjoyment.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 165

Eight: He deviated from the right path following his vain
desires, so his own desire resembles a leader who should be
followed.

Nine: He, the Almighty compared him to a dog, which is the
most low amongst creatures, because of its greed.

Ten: He compares his covetousness to this worldly life and his
impatience thereto and his grief of being deprived thereof by the
lolling out of the dog's tongue, whether it is left alone or driven
away. Accordingly, if that person is left alone, then he will be
covetous of this worldly life, and if he is advised he will still be
covetous of this worldly life. He clings to covetousness like
the dog with its tongue lolling out. Ibn Qutaibiyah said, "Surely
everyone pants because they are exhausted or thirsty, except
dogs, for it is their habit to pant while lolling their tongues out
in all cases, whether they are exhausted or not, and whether
they are thirsty or not, and that is why the Qur'anic expression
compared it to the disbeliever, asserting that he has gone
astray whether he is advised or left on his own. This is like the
dog whether it is left alone or driven away.

A Precious Gem: The Ignorant Worshipper and
the Immoral (Religious) Scholar

We have previously mentioned the case of the religious scholar
who prefers this worldly life rather than the Hereafter. However,
the mistake of the ignorant worshipper is rejecting knowledge,
Its verdicts, and his adherence to imagination and vain
desires.

Sufyan bin ‘'Uyainah and others said, "Beware of the trial of the
immoral (religious) scholar and that of the ignorant worshipper,
for both are apparent trials. The latter avoids knowledge out of
ignorance, and the former calls for wrong doings out of
immorality.

166 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Allan, the Exalted, sets the example of the ignorant worshiper
in the Qur'anic verse by saying,

( كَمَثَلٍ آلشيطَّن إِذْ قَالَ 3 أكفرٌ ‎EB‏ كفرَ قَالَ إن بَرِىَءٌ يّنكَ إن - ‎Bi BEI‏ 25

which means, "Their allies deceived them) like Shaitan (Satan),
when he says to man: "Disbelieve in Allah." But when (man)
disbelieves in Allan, Shaitan (Satan) says: "| am free of you, |
fear Allah, the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that
exists)! So the end of both will be that they will be in the Fire,
abiding therein. Such is the recompense of the Zalimdn (i.e.
polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers in Allah and in His
Oneness, etc.)." (Al-Hashr, 59:16-17)

His story is well known, for he has based his life on worshipping
Allah unknowingly, so Satan seized the opportunity and
seduced him causing his disbelief. So, this is the end of every
ignorant worshipper who unconsciously disbelieves, and the
other one is the final end of every immoral scholar who prefers
this worldly life rather than the Hereafter.

Allah, the Exalted, made His servant's pleasure and satisfaction
with this worldly life, besides his heedlessness of knowing the
Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations,
etc.) of Allah, and acting thereupon, as a reason for the
servant's misery and destruction. Those two attitudes (i.e.
satisfaction with this worldly life and heedlessness of the Ayat
of Allah) will not be found except in a heart, which disbelieves
in the Hereafter, and does not yearn for the meeting with Allah.

If anyone sincerely believes in the Hereafter, he would never
be satisfied with this worldly life nor would he be heedless of
the Ayat of Allah.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 167

If you think deeply about the human condition, you will find this |
trend prevalent amongst them; verily they are the inhabitants
of the world. However, only a few of them contradict this trend,
and that is why they are alienated from the majority. Every side
has its own business, different knowledge, intentions and ways
of life. Allah says,

‎tere “7 “ te g‏ رر & ”5 ‎Nee ive‏ - در صو 27 4 00 ص و
> إن الذيت لا ‎Ula Sy‏ وَرَضوأ بالحيّؤة ‎ol‏ وَاطمَانوا ‎G‏ وَالذِيت هم
له راد را #م - ‎-f‏ .2 130 9 َ- َس

‎which means, "Verily, those who hope not for their meeting with
Us, but are pleased and satisfied with the life of the present
world, and those who are heedless of Our Ayat (proofs,
evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), Those,
their abode will be the Fire, because of what they used to earn."
(Yunus, 10:7-8)

‎Allah describes the opponents of this trend and their final end in
another verse by saying,

‎fe a‏ راسو هر ب وماس رس 5 #2 ‎of le‏ عي
> د اليرت عامنوا وَعملوا ‎tel Me Agel Gels!‏ تجرف من نحتهم

‎0 vot

‎which means, "Verily, those who believe [in the Oneness of
Allah along with the six articles of Faith, i.e. to believe in Allah,
His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, Day of Resurrection,
and Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments) - Islamic Monotheism],
and do deeds of righteousness, their Lord will guide them
through their Faith; under them will flow rivers in the Gardens of
delight (Paradise)." (YGnus, 10:9)

‎The belief of such people in the meeting with Allah brings
about an unsatisfied feeling toward this worldly life, and an
ardent desire to remember Allah. Verily, this is the impact of

168 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

the belief in the meeting with Him, while the previously
mentioned is the impact of disbelief and heedlessness
concerning the meeting with Him.

A Great and Precious Gem: The Best Acquirement
for the Soul

Knowledge and faith are the best acquirements for the hearts
and souls of man, by which the servant (of Allah) can be
elevated in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. That is why
Allah, the Exalted, mentioned them both in the Qur'anic verse
in which He says,

which means, "And those who have been bestowed with
knowledge and faith will say: "Indeed you have stayed
according to the Decree of Allah, until the Day of Resurrection."
(Ar-Rum, 30:56)

In another verse He, the omen says,

which means, "Allah will exalt in degree those of you who
believe, and those who have been granted knowledge." (Al-
Mujadalah, 58:11)

Such people are the most righteous and they deserve the
highest degree. However, most people misinterpret the essence
of knowledge and faith by which happiness and superiority are
attained. Indeed, each sect claims that the knowledge and faith
to which they belong are those that lead to happiness. On the
contrary, most sects lack true faith that leads to salvation, as
well as_ elevated knowledge, to the extent that they block the
means to knowledge and faith that were revealed to the
Messenger (peace be upon him) to which he called the nation,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 169

namely that knowledge which he and his Companions adhered
to, and based their lifestyles on.

Maleficent Knowledge

Each sect believes that it has the correct knowledge by which it
rejoices. Allah says,

he
‏”زوز شام ب م‎ <1 ° Be FEE ‏ددر ور‎ a a \
tn ‏#رحول‎ pel ‏فتقطعوًا | هم بينهم زبرا كل حزب يما‎ #©

which means, “But they (men) have broken their religion among
them into sects, each group rejoicing in its belief.” (Al-Mu'mintn,
23:53)

Indeed, every sect offers arguments, opinions and falsehood
rather than pure knowledge, an idea which was asserted by
Hammad bin Zaid“ when he said, "| asked Ayytb** whether
knowledge today is prevailing or if it was prevailing in previous
periods,” to which he said, 'Today argumentation prevails,
while in the past, knowledge prevailed.”

Thus, this well-versed scholar distinguished between
knowledge and argumentation, for there were so many books
and yet so much argumentation, and discussion and disputes,
and the knowledge that had been revealed by Allah to the
Messenger (peace be upon him) was neglected. Allah says,

& 23 حاجّك فيه مِن بعد ما ‎Se Sele‏ العلم ‎Tyee‏ ©

which means, "Then whoever disputes with you concerning him
[lisa (Jesus)] after (all this) knowledge that has come to you."

Allah, the Almighty says also,
7 ‏ور و ل € , ~ 4 دوع صلا رس اس رد‎ +
(Ep. ‏مِنَ العلم‎ Hele CAN ‏أَهَوَاءَهم بَعَدَ‎ CST oy... «

which means, "And if you (OQ Muhammad) were to follow their
(Jews and Christians) desires after what you have received of
Knowledge (i.e. the Qur'an)..." (Al-Baqarah, 2:120)

In another verse, He, the Almighty describes the Qur'an saying,

=

022 3

which means, "He has sent it down with His Knowledge.” (An-
Nisa’, 4:166)

Which means that the Qur'an is the knowledge of Allah.

After a long period of time passed, most people adopted
suspicious ideas, and false thoughts and concepts as if they
were the core of knowledge, about which they wrote several
books, leaving no stone unturned in such initiatives, to the
extent that they wasted a lot of time in accumulating papers
and darkening the hearts of man. They went beyond all limits
by claiming that no knowledge is found in the Glorious Qur'an
and the Sunnah, assuming the their proofs are literal, while the
truth is that they were lacking in knowledge and conviction.

satan seized the opportunity to make them obsessed with
these misconceptions, so he succeeded to drive the hearts
away from knowledge and faith, the same as_ the serpent,
which throws its skin away.

The eminent Imam Shamsud-din Ibn Al-Qaiyim said, "One of
my companions was_ one of the followers of those so-called

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 171

scholars, and he was _ studying one their books without
memorizing the Glorious Qur'an, so he told him, ‘It is better for
you to memorize the Qur'an first.. The other one responded,
‘There is no knowledge in the Glorious Qur'an."

Ibn Al-Qaiyim added, "One of those who adopted this trend told
me, ‘We just listened to the Hadith in order to attain its
blessings regardless of the knowledge implied therein, for
others sufficed us in this task. We rely on their understanding
and judgments."

He added, "Our Sheikh told me once in describing those people
that they resorted to the chiefs of those sects and _ attained
nothing but contemptible desires. To prove this fact, namely
that their misconceptions are not considered the knowledge of
Allah, is the contradictions and differences included therein.
Allah says,

4 )2( ‏كَبيرا‎ Ube tas ‏لَوَجَدُوأ‎ AI ‏غَيْرِ‎ we J OF gs... «

which means, "Had it been from other than Allah, they would
surely have found therein many contradictions." (An-Nisa’,
4:82)

This verse proves that within the knowledge of Allah, there is no
contradiction, on the other hand, whatever is contradictory is
surely not from Allah, for how can misconceptions, suspicions,
and opinions be considered the religion revealed by Allah and
sent to His Messenger? Glorified be Allah! Indeed this is a
false charge.

On the other hand, the knowledge of the venerable
Companions of which they used to study was something other
than the misconceptions of those liars. Al-Hakim narrated in the
biography of Abu ‘Abdullah Al-Bukhary that the Companions of
the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to gather for

172 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

the sake of learning the Glorious Qur'an and the Sunnah
regardless of personal views or analogy.

Chapter: Faith and Those Who Disagree with It

The majority of people abandon faith, as Allah says,

4 2: obey Ce > ‏الناس وَلوَ‎ Al ‏وَمَا‎ «
which means, "And most of mankind will not believe even if you
desire it eagerly." (YGsuf, 12:103)

The faith of the majority of believers is incomplete but sure
faith, which means to believe in what the Messenger (peace be
upon him) was sent with, and to believe by knowing, learning,
declaring, and loving, means to know its opposite and hate it.
This is the faith of the pious of this nation and of the special
ones of the Messenger and it is the faith of the great companion
Abu Bakr and those like him. Most people merely declare the
existence of the Creator and that He alone created the Heavens
and the earth and what is between them. It is to be noted that
even the idol worshippers from the Quraish and others like
them believed in this.

To most people faith is simply reciting the two declarations of
faith either accompanied by deeds or not, and whether the
heart believes in them or not.

To others faith is just a heart that believes that Allah, the
Exalted is the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth and that
Muhammad is His servant and Messenger, even if a person did
not say it with his tongue or perform any deeds. And even if he
insults Allah and His Messenger and commits the gravest of
sins, he is a believer as long as he believes in the oneness of
Allah and the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him).

To others faith is denying the attributes of Allah, the Exalted like
the fact that He established Himself on the throne, His words,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

books, hearing, sight, will, powers, wishes, love, hate, and other
attributes that He described Himself with or His Messenger
described Him with. To them, faith is to deny all these facts and
they support their opinions by quoting those who deny and lie
about these matters. Those who argue with each other and
accuse each other of lying and those about whom ‘Umar bin Al-
Khattab and Imam Ahmad said, "They disagree in The Book,
disagree with it, and agree on deserting it.”

To others, faith is worshiping Allah according to their
inclinations and desires without any restrictions from what the
Messenger (peace be upon him) ordered us to do.

Faith to others is the state in which they found their fathers and
ancestors, regardless of this state, and their faith is based
upon two things:

One: This is the saying of our fathers and ancestors.
Two: Whatever they said is the truth.

Faith to others is simply maintaining high moral standards,
good treatment, being cheerful, thinking good of others, and
deserting people who commit sins.

To others faith is deserting this worldly life and its pleasures,
emptying the heart of it and renouncing worldly pleasures. If
they find a man like that they make him the best of the people
of faith even if he is far away from faith in both knowledge and
deeds. But worse than that, are those, who consider faith to be
mere knowledge even if it is not accompanied by good deeds.

Faith is something other than all that. It is a compound reality
that includes knowing what the Messenger came _ with,
believing in it, declaring it verbally, following it out of love and
submission, working and abiding by it both secretly and
publicly, obeying it, and calling others to it as much as possible.
To complete one’s faith, you should seek Allah alone in love,
hate, giving, and preventing, and Allah alone must be your Lord

174 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

and the only One whom you worship. The path, which leads to
that is by following His Messenger secretly and publicly and
keeping your heart away from anything other than Allah and
His Messenger.

٠ Whoever keeps himself busy seeking Allah instead of
himself, Allah will save him from himself, and whoever
keeps himself busy with Allah more than people, Allah will
save him from people. Whoever keeps himself busy with
himself rather than Allah, Allah will leave him to himself,
and whoever busies himself with people rather than Allah,
Allah will leave him to the people.

A Valuable and Precious Gem: The Origin of
Happiness

Whoever abandons habits for the sake of someone or
something other than Allah, will surely suffer hard and difficult
times. However, whoever abandons habits for the sake of Allah
sincerely from his heart, he will not suffer from leaving it except
at the beginning so that his credibility will be examined. If he
bears this pain it will be turned into pleasure. Ibn Sirin sald, "|
heard Shuraih swearing by Allah that a servant, when deserting
something, for the sake of Allah never suffers from its loss." It
was said, "Whoever abandoned anything for the sake of Allah:
Allah will compensate him with what is better. And
compensation is of different kinds and the best is to be
compensated by Allah with His love, and satisfaction within his
heart, its strength, activity, happiness, and contentment.

The most Foolish among People is he who Goes Astray at
the End of his Journey while he was about to Reach his
Destination

e The mind of man that is supported with success see
that what the Messenger (peace be upon him) brought
to us 15 right and that it agrees with reason and wisdom,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 175

but the ill minds see a contradiction between reason,
wisdom, and Islamic law.

e The means to attain closeness to Allah is to follow the
Sunnah secretly and publicly, resort to Allah, and seek
Him alone in our words and deeds. No one reaches
Allah except through these three and no one separates
from Allah except through leaving these three, or one of
them.

e The origins of happiness are based upon three things,
and each one of them has an opposite and whoever
lost one of these will get its opposite: monotheism and
its opposite, which is polytheism, Sunnah and _ it
opposite, which is innovation, and obedience and
disobedience. All these three have one opposite, which
is a heart that fails to seek Allah and the pleasures He
promises, and fails to fear Allah and the punishments
He promises for the wrong doers.

A Valuable and Important Rule: The People of
Guidance and the People of Misguidance

Allah, the Exalted says,

which means, "And thus do We explain the Ayat (proofs,
evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail,
that the way of the Mujrimdn (criminals, polytheists, sinners),
may become manifest." (Al-An’am, 6:55)

And He, the Almighty says,

which means, "And whoever contradicts and opposes the
Messenger (Muhammad) after the right path has been shown
clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We
shall keep him in the path he has chosen." (An-Nisa’, 4:115)

Allah, the Exalted shows in detail, the paths of the believers
and those of the sinners, as well as the consequences of both,
the deeds of both, the friends and supporters of both, along with
granting success to one of them, and the causes behind this
Success, and the causes of failure. Allah clarified the two
matters in His Book, and revealed and explained them to the
extent that we can see and differentiate between them as we
see and differentiate between light and darkness.

Those who know Allah, His Book, and His religion know in
detail the path of the believers and the path of the sinners. The
two paths were revealed in front of them like as road, which
reaches its destination and a road, which does not. Those who
know the best are the most useful to people, and they have the
most useful advice. That is why the Companions were
distinguished more than all those who came after them until
the Day of Resurrection. They were brought up amid the paths
of polytheism and the ways that lead to destruction and they
know it in detail, then the Messenger (peace be upon him) was
sent to them. He led them out of this darkness to the path of
light and to the straight way. They came out of darkness to
complete light, from polytheism to monotheism, from ignorance
to knowledge, from sin to goodness, from injustice to justice,
and from blindness and confusion to insight and right guidance.
They knew the value of what they received and what they had,
as the goodness and benefit of matters becomes clear after
knowing the opposite. They loved and their love increased for
what they received and what they became. And their hate
increased for what they left behind. They were the most loving
people to monotheism, faith, and Islam and the most to hate its
opposite. They knew the path in detail.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings © 177

Preference

Some of those who came after the Companions were brought
up in Islam and did not know its opposite, so some details were
confusing to them concerning the path of the believers and the
path of the disbelievers. This is because confusion occurs
when one has only a little knowledge of one or both paths. As
‘Umar bin Al-Khattab said, "The ties of Islam decreased one by
one with the people who were brought up in Islam and did not
know the pre-Islamic era." This shows the perfect knowledge
that ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) had. He knew the
pre-Islamic era and its rules, which encompassed all that
disagreed with what the Messenger (peace be upon him) was
sent with, and ail that is related to ignorance and that which
contradicted the Messenger (peace be upon him).

Those, who do not know the path of the sinners and it is not
obvious to him may consider the sinners to be believers, 5
has happened in this nation. Some people do not know the
matters of belief, knowledge, or deeds and so take the
disbelievers and enemies of the Messengers as friends. They
considered matters as lawful while they are forbidden by Allah
and His Messenger. This happened to the people of
innovations from among Al-Jahmiyyah, Al-Qadariyah, Al-
Khawarij, Ar-Rawafid, and others from among those who
created an innovation, called for it, and accused of disbelief
whoever disagrees with it.

Such people belong to four groups:

Group One: those who know both the paths of the believers
and that of the disbelievers in detail and prefer the path of the
believers both in knowledge and deeds.

Group Two: those who neither know this or that and they are
like animals and closer to the path of the disbelievers and
they follow it.

178 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Group Three: those who care more to know the path of the
believers alone and not its opposite. He only knows its opposite
through disagreeing with it and in a general way. Someone
once wrote to ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab asking him about the best
among two men: aman, who does _ not think about desires and
a man who fights his desires seeking Allah. So ‘Umar wrote
that whoever longs for his desires and sins but abandons them
seeking Allah is among those whom Allah had tested their
hearts for piety and for them is forgiveness and a great reward.

So whoever knows about innovation, polytheism, and its paths,
hated it for the sake of Allah, was cautious about them, warned
others about them, pushed them away, did not let them harm
his faith or cause doubts, and his insight increased by knowing
them and his hate increased, is better than the one whose
desires did not enter his heart. The more they came to the
heart and tempted him, the more his love increased in the
right and fought against them and the more his faith will
become stronger. He who is tempted by these desires and
sins, regardless of the way they came to him and he refused
and fought against them, he will love their opposite more and
long for it. Allah afflicts His believing servant with these desires
and sins in order to make him love what is better than them and
more useful and to fight against himself for the sake of Allah
only. This struggle will bring him closer to Allah. Whenever his
soul tempts him and he longs for it, he will change this longing
and desire to another direction, which is the superior kind.
Unlike the empty and cold soul even if it longs for what Is
Superior it will differ from the other. There is a difference
between he who travels to his beloved walking on a firebrand
and thorns and he who rides fine animals on his way and
between such a one and another who prefers his beloved while
fighting against others. Allah, the Exalted afflicts His servants
with desires either to be veil between them or to be a way to
seek the pleasure of Allah and closeness to Him.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠» 9

Group Four: those who know _in detail the path of evil,
innovations, and polytheism and the path of the believers. This
is the case of many among those who compare nations and
the people of innovations. , This is obvious for those who have
read their books. Whoever knows the path of evil, injustice, and
decay, was from among its people, but then repented, and
returned to the path of the believers and was good, and his
knowledge of this path will be general and he will not know its
details like he who spent his life studying its ways.

The meaning is that: Allah, the Exalted and ever Majestic, likes
that you know the path of His enemy so that you may avoid and
hate it, as He likes you to know the path of His people in order
to love and follow it. Such knowledge has a great deal of
benefit that Allah alone knows because of His wisdom, and the
perfection of His names and attributes. This is the greatest
proof of the Might and Justice of Allah, His ownership, Divine
power, love, hate, reward and punishment.

Those who are in need wait at the door of Allah asking for their
needs, while the people who love Him are close to Him. |] He
wishes to fulfill the need of any of them, He would show mercy
to them and give them honor. Surely to be far away from Allah
is like being beaten and punished.

Chapter: Ten Useless Matters

There are ten useless matters; knowledge that is not acted on,
the deed that has neither sincerity nor is based on following the
righteous examples of others, money that is hoarded, as the
owner neither enjoys it during this life nor obtains any reward
for itin the Hereafter, the heart that is empty; has neither love
nor longing for Allah, and does not want to be close to Him, a
body that does not obey and serve Allah, loving Allah without
following His orders or seeking His pleasure, time that is not
spent in expiating sins or seizing opportunities to do good, a
mind that thinks about what is useless, serving those who will

180 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

not bring you close to Allah nor will benefit you in your life,
hoping and fearing whoever is under the authority of Allah and
is in His hand; has no authority over himself either to do good,
bad, bring about death, life, or to resurrect himself.

However, the greater of these matters are wasting the heart
and wasting time. Wasting the heart is done by preferring this
worldly life more than the Hereafter, and wasting time is done
by having incessant hope. Decay occurs by following one’s
desires and having incessant hope while all goodness is found
in following the right path and preparing oneself to meet Allah.

How strange it is that when a servant of Allah has a problem, he
seeks the help of Allah but he never asks Allah to cure his
heart before it dies of ignorance, neglect, fulfilling one’s desires
and being involved in innovations. Indeed, when the heart dies,
he will never feel the significance or impact of his sins.

Chapter: The Right to Submit to Allah

Allah, the Exalted gave His servant an order, wrote a judgment
that He will fulfill, and a blessing that He will bestow. The
servant will never escape from these three things. The
judgment is of two kinds: either disasters or defects.

The individual ts a servant of Allah during all these three and
the most beloved to Allah among His creatures is he who
knows his duties of being a servant of Allah and fulfills this
right. Such people are those who are closest to Allah, while the
farthest from Him is he who fails to be a true servant of Allah
on all these three levels; and that rule becomes suspended for
him in both deeds and knowledge. Being a servant of Allah in
His order is ‏م1‎ sincerely obey and follow the example of the
Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Being a servant of
Allah in His forbiddance is to avoid what He has _ forbidden
while fearing, honoring, and loving Him. Being a servant of
Allah in His judgment of disasters is to be patient, and to be

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 1

satisfied with them, which is a higher rank, and moreover to
praise Allah for them and _ this is even higher than satisfaction.
He will be able to do that if love for Allah fills his heart, and if he
knows that Allah chooses what is best for him. Surely, Allah is
merciful to him, and even if he hates this disaster, it is for his
good.

Being a servant in judgment (of defects) is to seek repentance,
to place oneself in the position of giving apologies and to be
humble and sure that Allah is the only One who is capable of
removing such defects. No one can protect him from the evil of
these defects except Allah, and if these defects continue they
will keep him away from Allah and will expel him from the door
of Allah. Defects that are manifested in committing sins are evil
and only Allah can remove them and they are greater than the
defects of the body.

The true servant of Allah seeks His pleasure and not His
anger; he seeks His forgiveness not His punishment; he seeks
the help of Allah against Allah, and resorts to Him from Him,
and he knows that if Allah abandons him and leaves him to
himself, all evil will appear, and he knows that there is no way
to abandon sins and repent except with the help of Allah and
His support. tAll this is in His hand, not in His servant's hand:
the servant is weak and incapable to support himself or to
praise his Lord without His support, and permission. He is just
a poor and humble refugee throwing himself between the hands
of Allah and in front of His door. He needs, seeks, longs for,
and loves Allah; his body is busy in performing the orders of
Allah, his heart is bowing between His hands, and he knows
with certainty that there is no essential goodness ‏صل‎ himself,
and that all goodness is from Allah, and indeed He is the Lord
of all blessings. He knows that Allah bestows blessings on His
servant without his being worthy and He gives to him while he
sins and disobeys. The share of Allah is praise and thanks but
the share of the servant is dispraise and blame. Allah alone

182 © AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

deserves all praise and the servant deserves all blame. All
praise is to Him, all goodness is between His hands, all grace is
to Him, all thanks is to Him, and all favor comes from Him.

Allah treats His servants well while His servants are ungrateful
to Him. He becomes close to His servant by granting blessings
and the servant strays away from Allah by committing sins, and
He gives advice to His servant and His servant ridicules the
truth in return.

Being servant of Allah in blessings is to know and acknowledge
the blessings of Allah, to seek refuge in Allah and not to
ascribe any share of worship to other than Him, even if this
person is among the causes of having this blessing. Indeed if
such a person is the cause of blessings, it is because Allah
made him the cause. All blessings are from Allah alone and
showing thanks and praise and love to Allah is through using
His blessings and obeying Him.

Also being a servant of Allah in blessing is to perceive the
great number of blessings one has, even if they are few. To
know that all blessings come to him from His Lord without any
price being paid by him, asking, or even deserving it. Actually
this blessing increases his humility, submission, and love for
Allah. The more Allah bestows blessings on His servant, the
more the servant should submit to Him and love Him. The more
Allah prevents, the more content the servant should be, and
the more the servant commits sins, the more he will ask for
forgiveness. This is the good servant.

Chapter: The Sweetness of Trusting in Allah

The sincere servant of Allah abandons an act while planning
and hoping for more, fearing he will obtain less, asking for
health, or escaping from disease, knowing that Allah has power
over all things, that He alone has the choice and planning, that
Allah knows what will benefit His servant more than he does,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

and that He, the Almighty is more capable to grant it to him. He
is more useful to him than himself, more merciful than he is with
himself, and more kind to him than he is to himself. If the
servant of Allah knows that he cannot escape nor change the
plan of Allah, he will commit all his affairs to Allah and throw
himself between His hands as a humble servant throws himself
between the hands of a mighty king who has authority over him
and indeed the servant has no power of his own. When the
servant knows all that, he will be relieved from all distress and
sadness and will pass the burden to Allah who does not care or
get tired. Allah will carry them; show him kindness and mercy
without any tiredness. The servant has paid attention to Allah
alone and Allah paid attention to the needs and benefits of his
life and emptied his heart from them, and as a result, his life will
be good and his heart will be happy. However, if the servant
refuses and chooses to plan and chose for himself and cares
more for his right than for the right of Allah, He will leave him
with what he chose, and as a result he will live in distress,
sadness, grief, fear, tiredness, and a bad condition, and his
heart will never be pure, his work will not be suitable, and he
will never find relief or pleasure. It will be as if there is a veil
between himself and his pleasure and happiness. He works
hard during this worldly life but he does nothave any hope or
reward in his resurrection. Allah, the Exalted gives His servant
an order and gives him a guarantee. If the servant performs
what he was ordered to do, like giving advice, being truthful,
sincere, and diligent, Allah, the Exalted will fulfill what He
promised like subsistence, sufficiency, victory, and fulfillment of
one’s needs. Allah, the Exalted guarantees subsistence to
whoever worships Him, victory is for whoever trusts in Allah
and asks His support, sufficiency is for whoever takes Allah as
his only aim, forgiveness is for whoever asks for it, and Allah
will fulfill the needs of whoever asks Him sincerely and trusts in
Him. He, who is clever, cares for the orders of Allah and knows
that Allah is true to His promise. Allah says,

184 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

fo mms, or 31 | rok ‏من‎
‎4 ‏مر . الله‎ Hod gn a9) ‏...ومن‎

which means, "And who is truer to his covenant than Allah?"
(At-Tawbah, 9:111)

It is among the signs of happiness is that one pays attention to
the orders of Allah without wishing for any guarantee, and it is
among the signs of deprivation that the heart does not care for
the orders of Allah.

Bishr bin Al-Harith** said, "The people of the Hereafter are
three: the worshiper, the ascetic, and the sincere ones. The
worshiper worships Allah while seeking a reward whether in
this worldly life or in the Hereafter. The ascetic worships Allah
while neglecting that, and the sincere one worships Allah while
being satisfied regardless of whether Allah gives to him or not.

Distance and Separation

Do not ever side against Allah and His Messenger. If one is
ever guilty of this, it will lead him to distance and separation
from Allah. Distance means having rival parties on opposite
sides, and separation means to have both parties polarized.
This is not an easy matter. The lesson to be learned here is to
be on the side of Allah and His Messenger even if all the others
are on the other side. The consequences of that are significant
and long lasting. There is nothing more useful to the servant of
Allah during his worldly life and the hereafter than being
consistent on the side of Allah and His Messenger. It should be
noted however that the majority of people cling to the other
side, especially when desire and fear are intense. In such

“He is Bishr bin Al-Harith bin 'Abdur-Rahman bin ‘Ata’, known as Bishr ‏دام‎
‎Hafy. He is among the greatest ascetics and worshipers. He lived in Baghdad
and died in it in 227 A.'H. See Tahdhib At-Tahdhib, vol.1, p.444, Tarikh Al-
Bukhary Al-Kabir, vol.2, p.85, Al-Jarh wat-Ta‘dil, vol.2, p.356, Mizan Al-I'tidal,
vol.1, p.238.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 185

cases, you will hardly find any one on the side of Allah and His
Messenger. Furthermore, it is usual for people to think that
those who are on the side of Allah and His Messenger have
defects in their minds and choose badly and may even be
considered insane. Those who think in this way are the
inheritors of the enemies of the Messengers. The enemies of
the Messenger accused him of being insane when they were
on one side and he was on_ the other. But whoever adapts
himself to be in the good side will need deep knowledge of
what the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was sent
with, in order to remove any doubts he may have and he will
need complete patience in order to face the enmity of the
enemies and the blame of the blamers. This will never be
achieved without a strong will in seeking Allah and the
Hereafter; he should love the Hereafter more than this worldly
life and prefer it more and love Allah and His Messenger more
than anything else. According to the nature of man, there is no
harder deed than this. Himself, his desires, his nature, his
Satan, his brothers, and his companions call him from one side
to immediate pleasures and if he resists them, they will be
against him. But if he is patient, Allah will help him and this
difficult matter will become easy and pain will become
pleasure. Allan praises His servant and He will make him taste
the pleasure of being on the side of Allah and His Messenger
and grant him honor in a way that will increase the happiness
in his heart and which will empower him. All those who fought
him before will be either afraid of him or peaceful and his
helper. He will be stronger while his enemy will be weaker. Do
not think it is difficult to confront people and take the side of
Allah and His Messenger. If you are alone, Allah will be with
you; you will be in His eyes, in His trust. and under His
protection. He will only be testing your faith, belief, and
patience. What can help ‏ناملا‎ if Allah abandons you? Indeed,
It is easier to take the side of Allah and His Messenger but if
you sutfer from greed and fear, you will not be able to. If you

186 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

say, 'What will help me if | leave greed and fear?” You should
answer yourself, ‘Through monotheism, trust in Allah, and my
knowledge that rewards are from Allah alone, sins are removed
by Allah, and all matters are according to the will of Allah and
not from anyone or anything else.

Advice: How to Set Your State Aright

Let's strive to be close to Allah. Let’s long for the dwelling of
peace wherein there is no toil, stress or weariness. The
easiest way is to consider the fact that you are passing a period
that lies between two other periods, namely your current life,
which is the present one and it is between your past and your
future.

The past can be set aright through repentance, regret and
asking the forgiveness of Allah, and this is a way, which affords
you no toil, weariness or hard work, as it is concerned with the
heart.

The future can be set aright by abstaining from misdeeds, and
this is a means of comfort and relief for you, for it is not a
difficult act, but it is an intention that relieves your body, heart,
and your mind.

In brief, your past is set aright through repentance; your future
is set aright through abstention, determination and intention,
which have nothing to do with overburdening the body.

However, our concern here is with the present time as it stands
between the two other periods. If you waste it, then you are
wasting your happiness and salvation. On the contrary, if you
maintain it through setting your past and present aright, indeed
you will attain success, salvation, relief, and pleasure.

Improving your present state is much more difficult than setting
your past and your future aright, because it means that you
should abide by the most deserving and beneficial deeds to

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7

achieve happiness. There are’ great differences between
people in this regard. This is your chance to take the provision
for your Hereafter, either Paradise or Hellfire. So, if you take
this path to your Lord, you will attain glorious happiness and
great success during this short period of time which has no
value compared with eternity.

However, if you prefer vain desires, idleness, play and
amusement, the period would pass quickly, followed by a
permanent and great pain, the suffering of which is much more
severe than the suffering of patience, the patience required to
obey Allah.

Chapter: The Sign of Good Will

The sign of good will is when one seeks _ the pleasure of Allah,
preparing for His meeting, feeling grief for any moment that
passed in anything other than satisfying Him or keeping close
to Him, and feeling delighted with Him, in other words, to have
no interest in life except Allah all throughout the day.

Chapter: Asceticism in this Worldly Life

If people are satisfied with this worldly life, then they will be
satisfied with Allah. If people are content with this worldly life,
then they should be content with Allah. If people are delighted
with their lovers, then they should be delighted with Allah. If
people get acquainted with their masters and_ kings
approaching them to attain dignity and glory, then they should
know Allah and seek His pleasure, and then they will attain the
utmost glory and dignity. One of the ascetics once said, "! can
never imagine anyone who has heard about Paradise and

arrogant are not accepted (by Allah)." Thereupon, he told him,
"Advise me." The ascetic replied, "Abandon this worldly life
leaving it to its seekers, as they have abandoned the Hereafter
leaving it to its seekers. In this worldly life, imitate the bee, it
eats good food, and provides good food for others. if it
stumbles onto anything it never damages it.’

Chapter: Kinds of Asceticism (Abstinence)

There are many kinds of asceticism (abstaining from things in
this worldly life):

e Abstaining from unlawful things, which is an individual
duty.

e Abstaining from doubtful matters. This is evaluated by
the degree to which the doubtful matter relates; if the
doubtful matter is major, then avoiding it will be a duty,
and if it is minor, then avoiding it will be recommended.

e Abstaining from being overly curious.

e Abstaining from the matters, which do not concern you,
either, speech, a look, a meeting, or anything else.

e Abstaining from one's self, which means feeling inferior
for the sake of Allah.

e A general kind of asceticism, which means avoiding
everything rather than Allah, or even anything that
preoccupies you and keeps you away from Allah. The
highest level of asceticism is concealing it, and the most
difficult is overcoming one’s desires. The difference
between it and piety is that asceticism is abandoning
whatever is not beneficial for the Hereafter, while piety
is abandoning evil deeds for the sake of the Hereafter.
The heart, which is overwhelmed with vain desires 5
incapable of either asceticism or piety.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 9

Yahya bin Mu'adh said, "| wondered at the cases of three
people, one who performs acts of worship for the sake of
people, and fails to perform them for the sake of Allah, and one
who is greedy in giving charity, while he is asked by Allah to
lend a goodly loan but in vain, and the last one is he who seeks
the company of people, while Allah calls him to worship Him.

Disobeying a Command is Worse than Committing a Sin

Sahl bin ‘Abdullah * said, “Abandoning the command of Allah
is worse than committing a sin, for Adam was forbidden to eat
from the Tree, but he ate from it, and Allah forgave him. Satan
was commanded to prostrate before Adam, but he refused,
and Allah did not forgive him.”

| said, “This is a serious issue and is of great importance,
which is, “Disobeying commands is worse in the sight of Allah
than committing sins.” There are several points concerning
this.

Point one: that which Sahl mentioned about Adam and Satan,
the enemy of Allah.

Point two: the cause of committing a sin is in most cases, lust
and need. The cause of disobeying a command in most cases,
is pride and love of glory. It is well known that whoever has the
weight of an atom of pride in his heart will not enter Paradise,
but whoever dies and has the Oneness of Allah in his heart. will
enter Paradise even if he had committed adultery and theft.

Point three: obeying a command is dearer to Allah than
abandoning a sin, as has been indicated in many texts, such

born the year (200) A. H. He was an Imam and a scholar in the field of
theology, mathematics and the flaws of deeds. He wrote a book called (fi
Tafsir Al-Qur’an), and the book (Raqaiq Al-Muhibin). He (may Allah have
mercy upon him) died in (283) A. H. Adopted from Al-Bidayah wa-Nihayah
(11\79).

190 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

as the words of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him),
“The dearest deed to Allah is the performance of prayer at its
due time.”“°

And his hadith, “Shall | inform you about the best of your
deeds, the most virtuous and pure in the sight of the Owner,
the heaviest in the (scale of) your grades and better for you
than confronting your enemy while you fight them and they fight
you” Thereupon they said, “Yes, Messenger of Allah”, then he
said, “Remembering Allah.” *” And his hadith, “You should know
that the best of your deeds is the performance of prayer...”*8
and so on.

Furthermore, abandoning a sin is a deed, which is refraining
oneself from an action. That is why, Allah, the Almighty related
love to the undertaking of commands by saying,

> 1 2 آ. 1 12 5

which means, “That is because they followed that which

The previously mentioned verses lead us to understand that the
deeds that please Allah, the Almighty are meant for the sake of
their own virtue. That is why He preordains what He hates
because it leads to what pleases Him.

He has also preordained wrongdoing, disbelief and wickedness

due to what results from them like fighting in the Cause of
Allah, martyrdom, repentance, invocation, submission,
manifesting His Justice, Forgiveness, Revenge and
Glorification, in addition to showing loyalty and hostility for His
Sake, and other deeds. They are dearer to Him than removing
their causes.

Therefore, it should now be clear that undertaking what pleases
Him is dearer to Him than avoiding what He hates.

Point four clarifies that: obeying a command is meant for the
sake of its own virtue, while abandoning a sin is meant to be
done for the completion of the command. Allah, the Exalted,
informed us that the prohibition of intoxicants and gambling is
because they hinder man from remembering Allah and
performing prayer. So, the prohibited acts are simply those that
hinder man from obeying commands or perfecting them.

Point five clarifies that: obeying commands is a form of
maintaining faith, while abandoning sins is a form of protecting
faith from being disturbed. Maintaining faith is worthier than the

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 3

act of protection, because the more the power of faith becomes
stronger, the more it can push away evil elements, and when it
becomes weak, the evil elements will prevail.

Point six: obeying commands is a revival, nourishment,
adornment, joy, delight of the eye, pleasure and grace of the
heart, while abandoning sins without obeying commands,
would not benefit anything and shall abide in the Hellfire for
ever.

Point seven: whoever undertakes both the prescribed and the
forbidden deeds would either be saved if his good deeds
exceed his sins, otherwise he would be saved after being
punished for his misdeeds. Therefore, his abode would be
Salvation by virtue of obeying the commands.

On the contrary, whoever abandons both the prescribed and
the prohibited deeds would be ruined, and would never be
saved except by obeying the command, which is monotheism.

It could be argued that he would be ruined due to committing
the prohibited, which is polytheism. This could be responded to
by saying that it is enough to be ruined by abandoning
monotheism, which has been commanded even if he does not
commit polytheism, and moreover, when his heart becomes
void of monotheism, and has not adopted monotheism, he
would be ruined even if he does not worship anything with
Allah. And if the worship of other than Him is added to that, he
would be punished for abandoning monotheism, in addition to
committing polytheism, which is prohibited.

Point eight: concerning he who is called to faith, if he says, "I
neither believe nor disbelieve, | neither love nor hate and |
neither worship Him (Allah) nor worship other than Him,” he will
be a disbeliever by virtue of abandonment and renunciation.
However, if he says, "| believe in the Messenger, | love him, |
have faith in him and do whatever he orders me, but my
desires, will and nature are controlling me in such a way that |

194 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

cannot abandon what he has prohibited me. | know quite well
that he has prohibited me to do certain deeds, but | cannot quit
them.” In this case, he would not be considered a disbeliever,
and his judgment is not like that of the first one, for he is
obedient to some extent.

Point nine: both obedience and disobedience are basically
related to the command and subsequently to the forbidden, in
other words, the obedient one complies with the command
while the disobedient one abandons it. Allah, Exalted be He,
says,

4 Ane

« ...لا يَعَْصون الله ما ‎papal‏ ...:2

which means, “who disobey not, (from executing) the
Commands they receive from Allah." (At-Tahrim, 66:6)

And Musa (Moses) said to his brother,
= ‏الى‎ JF, we 5 03 27 ‏اي‎ took, 2 an ‏سرس‎ 3

which means, "0 Hardin (Aaron)! What stopped you when you
saw them going astray; "That you followed me not (according to
my advice to you)? Have you then disobeyed my order?" (Taha,
20:92-93)

On his death, ‘Amr bin Al-'As said, "O Allah! | am the one whom
You commanded, but unfortunately, | disobeyed (Your order),
but (I testify that) there is no god but You.”

The purpose of sending messengers is to obey them. By
obeying the messengers we automatically comply with His
orders. Abandoning what has been forbidden is the completion
of obedience and accordingly, if the prohibited deeds are
abandoned while the command is not obeyed, surely he would
not be obedience. On one hand, he would be considered
obedient as he obeyed the command, but on the other hand he

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 195

would be considered disobedient because he performed a
prohibited act. Thus he is completely different from the one who
abandoned the command.

Point ten: complying with a command is an act of worship, a
duty and a means of closeness to Allah, and that is the reason
why man was created. Allah, Exalted be He, said,

ر راث # صه دي اسه 3 8
‎GAT cal Uy «‏ وَالإنس إلا ‎oad‏ (2 »4

which means, "And | (Allah) created not the jinns and humans
except they should worship Me (Alone)." (Adh-Dhariyat, 51:56)

In this verse, Allah, Exalted be He, informs mankind that the
purpose of their creation is to worship Him and to know Him. In
the same way, He sent them His Messengers and revealed His
Divine Books so that they might know and worship Him.
Therefore, worshipping Allah and Knowing Him is the purpose
for which they have been created. Abandoning prohibited acts
is not an end in itself, however, the act of complying with a
command is required.

Point eleven: prohibition means that certain acts are not to be
performed i.e., it is a not-to-do command; whereas a command
requires an action to be followed, i.e., a to-do command.
Therefore, the reality of prohibition returns to compliance to the
command, and in this way the prohibition contains a ‘to-do’
command to be followed.

Point twelve: Muslim scholars have different views concerning
the significance of performing a prohibited action. (1) The
majority of scholars stated that the significance lies in keeping
oneself away from the prohibited action and to maintain self-
control. They based their argument on the premise that a ‘to-
do’ command focuses on matters that exist while a ‘not-do-
command’ focuses on matters that do not exist.

196 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

(2) The scholar Abu Hashim and others viewed that abiding by
prohibitions signifies avoiding an action. The result of this is to
keep that action in a state of non-existence, even If the action
has not yet occurred to him, as well as keeping his intention
clear to keep away from it. If the significance of avoiding
prohibited matters was just to keep away from the prohibition,
the person would be a sinner if he did not undertake it.

(3) Tne judge Abu Bakr says that prohibitions are preordained
and what is important here is to keep the act in a state of
nonexistence.

(4) Another group of scholars say that a command to keep
away from something basically means to 00 the opposite
action, for itis a preordainment. Allah only prohibits man from
depravity for the sake of abstinence, and that is what Is
commanded, and He prohibited him from wrongdoing for the
sake of justice, which is necessary to be followed, and He
prohibited him from lying for the sake of telling the truth. This is
the case for all prohibitions.

According to them, the core matter of a prohibition is the
command for the opposite of the prohibited act; the command
has then returned to the fact that required a deed to be
performed.

The correct view is that an ordainment can be classified into
two categories: that which is sought for the virtue of its own self,
and another that is pursued for the sake of something else. li
the person did not feel like doing an evil deed or his own self
did not urge him to do it, and the act remained _ in the original
state of nonexistence, he would not be rewarded for keeping
away from the prohibition.

. However, if it occurred to him, and he kept himself away from tt
for the sake of Allah and abandoned it willingly, he would be
rewarded for keeping away from it.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ® 197

The reward is given for the ‘to-do’ command, whereas it is not
given for an act that is in a state of absolute nonexistence. If
the person abandons the act, while repressing a strong desire
to do it he will be rewarded. However, if he abandons it
because he is unable to do it, there is no reward. If he intended
to do it but circumstances prevented him, he would not be
punished like that of the doer, but he would be punished for his
evil intention and desire to carry it out.

There are many texts concerning this issue, but it is not
beneficial here to examine all the contradictory opinions.

Allah, the Almighty said,

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, “When two
Muslims fight (meet) each other with their swords, both the
murderer as well as the murdered one will go to the Hell-fire.'
They said, 'O Messenger of Allah! It is all right for the murderer
but what about the murdered one?' The Messenger of Allah
replied, "He surely had the intention to kill his companion.” *°

_ And in another hadith, “And a man said, if | had money, | would
do (evil deeds) just like so and so. This person shares the same
sin with him, due to his intention.” °°

Commentary on the above mentioned views:

Abu Hashim viewed that one who avoids vice is praiseworthy
even if he did not think of self-control (as the desire to
undertake a vice was not originally there). If Abu Hashim
meant by the word praiseworthy, that such a person is not
condemned. If he meant real praise, his view would be
considered incorrect.

This argument ts based on the fact that people never praise an
impotent person for refraining from fornication; nor do they
applaud a dumb person for avoiding slander and backbiting.
People usually only praise those who keep away from vice
while they have the ability to do it.

The judge Abu Bakr said that what is meant by prohibition is to
keep the act in its original state of nonexistence, which is
preordained. If he means by his statement to keep oneself
away from the prohibited action and to have self-control, this

Majah no. (4228),

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 199

would be correct, but if he means mere nonexistence, then it
would not be correct.

The group of scholars, who asserts that a command to keep
away from something basically means to undertake the
opposite action, are incorrect, because the basic concept here
is to do both things: to keep away from a prohibition and to
undertake its opposite command as well.’ This is justified by
the fact that the necessary means to undertake an obligation
are not sought for their own virtue, as it is the preordained
obligation that is sought for its virtue, and it is prohibited to
hinder or weaken it. Thereupon, the prohibition is ordained only
as a means to undertake the ends or help the desired end to
come into existence.

Point thirteen: a command to undertake an action entails a
prohibition to keep away from the opposite. This is true on the
level of a logical necessity rather than a basic requirement. The
significance of a command is to undertake it. Moreover, the aim
of the Prohibitor when prohibiting an action, in the first place, is
to put an end to that prohibited action. Being involved in_ its
opposite comes on the level of logical necessity.

Therefore, He enacted a prohibition to keep away from the
direct opposite of a command i.e. the command to act is the
matter pursued for the sake of its own virtue.

The summary of the matter is that the command to do
something is a command for the sake of its own virtue, and for
its required necessity, and the prohibition of doing something is
a command to avoid it, and the necessity to do so. Therefore,

57 Translator's Note: To clarify this we take as an example the command to
keep away from telling lies and to hold fast to telling the truth. According to
the author, Ibn Al-Qayyim, the command to keep away from telling lies is
meant for itself, though not in the first place, in addition to abide by the
command to commit oneself to telling the truth.

200 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

what is required in both issues is an action and an
abandonment, and both of them are a ‘to-do’ command.

Point fourteen: command and prohibition are on the level of an
order. There is no praise where there is no affirmation, for
negation, like its name, is a state of nonexistence that has no
perfection or praise. If it contains an affirmation, there would be
praise associated with it, like the negation of forgetfulness,
which is essential for the perfection and manifestation of
knowledge.

The negation of fatigue is essential for the perfection of strength
and ability. The negation of sleep is essential for the perfection
of life and the eternal state. The negation of child and wife is
essential for the perfection of self sufficiency and sovereignty.
The negation of partnership, support and intercession without
leave is essential for the perfection of the Oneness of Allah and
the uniqueness of His Perfection, Divinity and Sovereignty. The
negation of oppression includes the perfection of justice. The
negation of eyes to see Him includes His Majesty and that He is
too Great to be seen, even if eyes will see Him (on the Day of
Resurrection).

If this is understood, then we should know that if the prohibition
does not include a confirmatory ‘to-do’ command, people would
not be praised for abandoning it, and would not deserve to be
rewarded or praised for abandoning it.

Point fifteen: Allah, the Almighty made the reward for obeying
commands tenfold, and the reward for abstaining from
prohibitions only one. This indicates that what He commanded
to be undertaken is dearer to Him than abandoning what He
prohibited. If it was the opposite, the evil deed would be tenfold
and the good deed would be one reward or equivalent to the
former.

Point sixteen: what is meant by the prohibited deed is to put
an end to it so that it does not come into existence, whether he

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 20]

intended that or not and whether it occurred to him or not. The
purpose of the commanded deed is to let it be; to let it exist and
show love to Allah by one’s intention and deed concerning it.

The core of the matter is that the existence of what He
commanded to be done is dearer to Him than the nonexistence
of what He commanded to be put to an end. Therefore, His love
for the undertaking of what He commanded is greater than His
hate for doing what He prohibited.

Point seventeen: It is from His infinite mercy that man does
what pleases Him, helps in undertaking it, rewarding it and
whatever follows. If man commits what He hates, then
whatever follows that like dispraise, pain and punishment are
part of His Anger. His Mercy precedes His Anger, and
everything related to the attribute of mercy is dominant
throughout creation compared to the attribute of anger, for
Allah, the Almighty would not be anything else except Merciful,
and His Mercy is part of His Self, like His Knowledge, Ability,
Life, Hearing, Vision and Kindness. Therefore, it is impossible,
with respect to Him, to be the opposite of these attributes.

His Anger is not necessary to His Self, and so He is not always
angry to the extent that it is impossible to stop being so.
Moreover, His Messengers, who are the most knowledgeable of
all creation will say on the Day of Resurrection, “My Lord is
more angry than He has ever been before and will never be in
the future.” °° His Mercy encompasses all things, while His
Anger does not. He, Exalted be He, has prescribed Mercy for
Himself, whereas He has not prescribed Anger for Himself, and
He has embraced all things with mercy and knowledge,

52 Recorded by Al-Bukhary. Kitab, Ahadith Al-Anbiya’, bab, the Word of Allah,
the Exalted,

which means: “Verily, We sent Nth (Noah) to his people” no. (3340), and
Muslim, no. (194)

202 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

whereas He has not embraced all things with anger and
revenge.

Therefore, mercy, and everything related to it, including its
necessities and effects are predominant over anger and
everything related to it and its effects. So, the means of mercy
are dearer to Him than the existence of what necessitates
anger. That is why mercy is dearer to Him than punishment,
and pardoning is dearer to Him than revenge.

In this respect, the existence of what pleases Him is dearer to
Him than neglecting what He hates, especially if the neglect of
what He hates will prevent the existence of what pleases Him.

Point eighteen: Removing the effects of what He detests, i.e.,
prohibitions, by undertaking what He likes, i.e., the commands;
could happen quicker than the effacement of what He likes, |.e.,
commands, by what He detests, i.e., the prohibitions. Allah, the
Almighty might remove it with pardoning and overlooking. It
might also be removed with repentance, forgiveness, righteous
deeds, misfortunes that cause expiation of sins and
intercession.

It is well known that righteous deeds remove evil deeds. Even
if the sins of the servant reached the clouds, and then he turned
to Allah for forgiveness, He would forgive him. And if he meets
Him with sins the magnitude of the earth, while worshipping
none besides Him, He would meet him with the likeness of it in
forgiveness.

He, the Almighty, forgives sins even if they are as numerous as
the waves of the sea. Allah is willing to cancel them and their
effects with the slightest effort from His servant, who displays
true repentance and remorse. That would happen because of
the existence of what pleases Him like repentance, obedience
and pure monotheism, and this fact indicates that the
existence of such things are dearer to Him.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

Point nineteen clarifies that: Allah, the Almighty preordained
the existence of those things that He hates, due to the
goodness that follows them . This is because He, the Almighty
is more pleased with the repentance of His servant than the
person who lost something dear and then found it; than the
barren woman who has just given birth to a child, and the thirsty
person who has just arrived at a watering place. The
Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) gave an excellent
example about His Joy that goes beyond all measure when His
servant repents. This does not mean that everything that
pleases Him is dearer to Him than avoiding every deed that
He hates, to extent that the two rak’ahs of forenoon Prayer
become dearer to Him than not killing a Muslim, but what is
meant is that the general concept of obeying His commands is
better than the general concept of avoiding prohibitions.

The main issue here is the significance of repentance, which
renders a deed beloved to Allah. Some people might say that
Allah rejoices when His servant repents and that repentance
occurs because of avoiding a prohibited act, then the joy was
caused by abandonment.

To this we say that absolute abandonment is not the cause of
joy, and moreover, itis not the cause of reward or praise.

Repentance is not essentially abandonment, although
abandonment is one of its requirements. Rather it is a ‘to-do’
command, which means that the servant repents to his Lord
and becomes dutiful to Him. To make this happen in reality it is
necessary that the prohibited thing be abandoned. That is why
the Exalted said,

= oT ee 5 ‏1ه‎ Pn a nO
4 20... ‏نم توبوأ إليه‎ ISS ‏اسْتغفروأ‎ oly «

which means, “And (commanding you): "Seek the forgiveness
of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance.” (Had, 11:3)

204 ٠» AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Therefore, repentance means turning away from what is hated
to what pleases Him, and not just abandonment, because
someone may merely abandon a sin, and not keep away from
it for the sake of Allah and then adopt what pleases the Exalted.
In this case, he would not be truly repentant, for repentance
means refraining from something and turning in repentance to
Allah with a sincere heart.

Point twenty: if someone fails to obey the commands of Allah
he would be bereft of life, and that is what the Exalted said,

ل هي ص لاسر >4 2231 تج" ينه رواج ير ا ا ان 1 700

which means, “O you who believe! Answer Allah (by obeying

benefit them and similarly the disbelievers).” (An-Naml, 27:80)

Doing a prohibited act, causes diseases of the heart, which is
a living death.

some of the prohibitions lead to polytheism, which is
destruction in this life and the next.

It could be said that ruin comes about due to a lack of
monotheism, and obeying Allah’s commands brings about life,
but when obedience is lacking destruction is imminent.

Point twenty one: failing to obey even some of Allah's
commands brings about ruin and permanent misfortune.

Point twenty two: obeying Allah’s commands requires
abandonment of the prohibited deed if it Is undertaken in its
correct form with sincerity, following up and being done for the
sake of Allah. The Exalted said,

‎ao a 5-5 5-5‏ 52 = ا مر راسم تور “ _
‎١ 40 ow 1 ~ “ x,‏ 5 و 01 “ . ايت ‎re‏

‎which means, “Verily, As-Salat (the prayer) prevents from Al-
Fahsha’ (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual
intercourse, etc.) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and
every kind of evil wicked deed, etc.)” (Al-‘Ankabut, 29:45)

‎The mere abandonment of prohibited deeds does not require
performing the commanded deed.

‎Point twenty three: the deeds that He commanded are related
to His attributes, and the prohibitions that He hates are
related to the results of His Actions. This is a difficult point that
needs to be illustrated. Therefore, we say that prohibitions are
evil deeds that lead to more evil deeds, and commands are

206 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

righteous deeds that lead to more righteous deeds. The
righteous deed lies in His Hand, whereas the evil deed is not
related to Him. This is because evil does not belong to His
attributes, His actions or His Beautiful Names, but it belongs to
the results and consequences of actions, though it is evil with
respect to the servant, but with respect to the Creator, the
Almighty, it is not evil (it does not affect Him).

Therefore, the purpose of allowing the servant to commit a
prohibited deed is to produce an evil result on the servant,
though it is not necessarily essentially evil for the servant.
Failing to obey Allah’s commands means that a righteous
deed is missed, and whenever the command is more pleasing
to Allah, the Exalted, like monotheism and faith, the evil that
occurs by missing it is greater.

The core of these points is that obeying His command is what
pleases Him, and He hates the prohibited acts.

Chapter: Remembering Allah and Being Grateful
to Him

Islam is based on two fundamental concepts: remembering
Allah and being grateful to Him. Regarding this Allah, the
Exalted, says,

ده جع م در ور مو ‎gt‏ م + ,£7
« فاذ كرون أذكركج ‎ig Sahl‏ لى وَلا تكفرون 4

which means, "Therefore remember Me (by praying, glorifying,
etc.) | will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My
countless Favours on you) and never be ungrateful to Me." (Al-
Baqarah, 2:152)

The Prophet (peace be upon him) once told Mu'adh, "By Allah! |
love you so much so do not forget to say at the end of each
prayer, ‘Allahumma a'inny ‘ala dhikrika wa shukrika wa

00 ‏ل)‎ >

SY

husni ‘ibadatik (O Allah! Help me to remember You, to feel
grateful to You, and to worship You perfectly).'"°°

It is worth mentioning here that remembering Allah does not
include only remembering Him verbally ( with one's tongue) but
it also includes remembering Him within one’s heart. However,
the mode of remembering Him includes remembering His
Names, His Attributes, His commandments, His prohibitions, as
well as remembering Him by uttering His words, which entails
knowing Him, believing in Him, and believing both in the
Attributes of His Perfection, and the qualities of His Majesty. It
also entails glorifying Him in various ways of praising, which is
not applicable except through monotheism, for true
remembrance requires the previously mentioned aspects, as
well 35 the remembrance of His bounties, blessings and
beneficence.

On the other hand, gratefulness to Allan means obeying Him
and getting closer to him by performing those deeds that have
been ordained by Him, both the inner and the outer ones.

Those two fundamentals are considered the core of religion, for
remembering Allah entails knowing Him, and being grateful to
him entails obeying Him, which is the reason behind the
creation of all things. It is also the reason for which punishment
and reward are founded, divine books are revealed, and
messengers are sent. That is the truth by which the heavens,
the earth, and all that is between them are created, and the
contrary is falsehood above which He is Exalted, and this is the
misconception adopted by His enemies.

which means, "Allah has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House,
an asylum of security and Hajj and ‘Umrah (pilgrimage) for
mankind, and also the Sacred Month and the animals of
offerings and the garlanded (people or animals, etc. marked
with the garlands on their necks made from the outer part of the
stem of the Makkah trees for their security), that you may know
that Allah has knowledge of all that is in the heavens and all
that is in the earth, and that Allah is the All Knower of each and
everything.” (Al-Maiidah, 5:97)

The previous verses prove that the aim of creation is to
remember Allah and be grateful to Him; remembrance without
forgetfulness, and gratefulness without disbelief. Allah, the
Exalted, remembers the one who remembers Him, and He is
grateful to the one, who is grateful to Him. So remembering
Allah is the reason behind Allah’s remembrance and being
grateful to Allah is the reason behind increasing the blessings of
Allah.

In brief, remembering Allah should be done with both the
tongue and the heart. However, being grateful to Allah is done
out of love and repentance from the heart, and out of praise
and glorification from the tongue, and out of obedience and
servitude from the body.

Chapter: Guidance Leads to More Guidance and
Aberration Leads to More Aberration

It has been repeated in the Quran that deeds that are
performed in the hearts and the body are the cause of
guidance and aberration. Therefore, deeds that are done in the
hearts and the body require guidance, just like the way an
effect is attached to a cause, and the same thing applies to
aberration. So righteous deeds produce guidance, and
whenever there is an increase in them, there would be an
increase in guidance. When evil deeds are performed, they will
increase. That is because Allah, the Almighty loves righteous

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 211

deeds and that is why He rewards them with guidance and
success. And He hates evil deeds, so He rewards them with
aberration and distress.

Also, because He loves righteous deeds and righteous people,
He brings their hearts close to Him according to the amount of
righteous deeds they perform. And because He hates evil
deeds and evil people, He keeps their hearts far away from
Him according to the degree of evil that they are guilty of.

According to the first principle, Allah, the Almighty said,
4) 6H) ole ‏فيه‎ Cg ‏الكتَب لا‎ oss ay Sip

Alif-Lam-Mim. [These letters are one of the miracles of the
Qur'an and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings]. This
is the Book (the Qur'an), whereof there is no doubt, a guidance
to those who are A/-Muttaqun [the pious and righteous persons
who fear Allan much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil
deeds which He has forbidden) and love Allah much (perform
all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)].” (Al-Baqarah,
2:1-2)

This contains two instructions:

Instruction One is that He guides the person who abstains
from prohibited things that cause His Displeasure for it is
known by all people that Allah, the Almighty hates oppression,
adultery, mischief on the earth, and that He hates those who
do these deeds. In the same way, He loves justice, kindness,
generosity, truthfulness and spreading goodness on earth, and
He loves those, who 00 these deeds. When the Book was
revealed, Allah, the Almighty rewarded the righteous people
by making it easy for them to believe in it as an act of
recompense to them for their righteous deeds and obedience.
And He forsook the evil oppressors by coming in between them
and guidance.

212 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

The Stages of Guidance

Instruction Two is that after the servant believes in the Book,
and is guided by it in general, accepts its orders and believes
in what it contains, there would be more guidance for that
Servant, for there is no end to guidance, regardless of how far
the servant reaches; there would always be above him
guidance upon guidance, and after that guidance more
guidance. Whenever the servant fears his Lord, he would
receive more guidance, and he would always be increased ‏مز‎
‎guidance as long as he fears Allah, the Almighty. And whenever
he neglects a chance to be pious, he would be missing a
chance to receive guidance, and whenever he fears Allah, the
Almighty his guidance would increase, and whenever he
accepts guidance, his piety would increase. To illustrate this
fact, consider the following verses from the Glorious Qur'an,

And He, the Exalted said,

which means, “And none remembers but those who turn (to
Allah) in obedience and in repentance (by begging His Pardon
and by worshipping and obeying Him Alone and none else).”
(Ghafir, 40:13)

And He, the Exalted said,

and do deeds of righteousness, their Lord will guide them
through their Faith.” (Ydnus, 10:9)

First, He guided them to faith, and then when they accepted
that guidance and believed in it, He rewarded them by guiding
them to more faith as an act of guidance after guidance. The
likeness of this is in the following verses of the Glorious Qur'an,

gv

214 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

which means, “And Allah increases in guidance those who walk
aright [true believers in the Oneness of Allah who fear Allah
much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He
has forbidden), and love Allah much (perform all kinds of good
deeds which He has ordained)].” (Maryam, 19:76)

Allah, the Almighty also said,

wrong), or (Makhraj, i.e. making a way for you to get out from
every difficulty)}.” (Al-Anfal, 8:29)

As a part of this criterion, is that Allah, the Almighty grants
them some light, with which they can differentiate between truth
and falsehood, and He also grants them victory and glory that
enable them to establish truth and destroy falsehood. The
Qur’an has commented on this point. Allah, the Almighty
sald,

steadfast grateful (person).” (Saba’, 34:19)

This is in Chapters Lugman, lbrahim, Saba’ and As-Shura.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 215

He revealed these verses to benefit those who have patience
and are grateful. Just as He revealed His Glorious Qur’anic
verses to benefit the pious, those, who fear Allah and return to
Him in repentance, those whose intentions are to seek His
Pleasure, and that it is only observed by those who fear Allah,
the Almighty. Allah, the Almighty said in the Quran,

‎Wil i ab #‏ عليك القرءًان لتشقئ © إلا تدكرة لمن خثى ري 4

‎which means, “Ta@Ha These letters are one of the miracles of
the Qur'an, and none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.]
We have not sent down the Qur'an unto you (O Muhammad) to
cause you distress, but only as a Reminder to those who fear
(Allah).” (Taha, 20:1-3)

‎He, the Almighty also said about the Hour,
27 2 ‏يمن‎ « 7 tt we Ex Le

‎which means, “You )0 Muhammad) are only a warner for those
who fear it.” (An-Nazi’at, 79:45)

‎lf someone does not believe in it, and does not hope for it or
fear it, the Quranic Verses will not benefit him. That is why
Allah, the Almighty mentioned the punishment of the nations
who falsely denied the Messengers and that which happened to
them. He said,

‎220... HEV Glas ‏لمن خافٌ‎ AY ENS ‏إن فى‎ ©

‎which means, “Indeed in that (there) is a sure lesson for those
who fear the torment of the Hereafter.” (Hud, 11:103)

‎He mentioned that there is a lesson for those who fear the
torment of the Hereafter in His punishment of those who reject
faith.

216 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

It would not be a lesson for the person who does not believe in
it and does not fear its torment. That is why when such a
person hears its verses, he says, “There is still good and bad in
the world. There is comfort and distress, happiness and
unhappiness.” And they may attribute that to astronomic and
psychological causes. But in reality, it was due to the patience
and gratefulness of the person concerned.

Faith is founded on both patience and gratefulness. Therefore,
the servant’s faith will be strong according to his patience and
gratefulness. The verses of Allah will only benefit those who
believe in Him and His verses, and faith is granted through
patience and gratefulness. The main part of gratefulness is
monotheism, and the main part of patience is not to yield to vain
desires. If the person is a polytheist who follows his vain
desires, he would not be patient or grateful, therefore, the
verses would neither be beneficial for him nor be a means of
him being granted faith.

Chapter

The second principle is the consistency of evil, arrogance and
falsehood along with aberrance: and there are many examples
of that in the Qur’n, like the following verses,

as regards keeping good relations with kith and kin), and do

He, the Exalted, announced that He punished them due to their
disbelief when the Prophets came to them with the message.
They knew it well, but they just turned away from it, so Allah,
the Almighty turned their hearts and their eyes away from
guidance, and came in between them and faith. Just as the
Almighty said,

which means, “They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten

He rewarded them for their indifference to Him by forgetting

concerning them. He also said that He made them forget
themselves, therefore, they did not try to make themselves
perfect by means of good knowledge and righteous deeds,
which are guidance and the religion of truth (Islam). He made
them forget to seek after that, to love it, learn it and aspire after
it, aS a punishment for their indifference to Him. The Almighty

them their piety.” (Muhammad, 47:16-17)

He combined following one’s vain desires with aberration,
which is its outcome and its cause, just as He connected piety
and guidance for those who are guided.

Chapter: Guidance is the Partner of Mercy and
Aberration is the Partner of Misery

Just as Allah, the Almighty connects guidance and piety, and
aberration and transgression, in the same way, He connects
guidance, mercy, aberration and distress. Concerning the first,

Verily, there are various expressions of the predecessors
concerning the interpretation of the words (Bounty) and
(Mercy). But the truth is that they refer to guidance and grace.
His Bounty is His Guidance, and His Mercy is His Grace. That is
why He connects guidance and grace, just like in Al-Fatihah,

The likeness of this is His word to His Messenger (peace be

Chapter: Bestowing and Preventing

Guidance, mercy and what follows them like favors and gifts
are all elements of the attribute of bestowing. Aberration,
punishment, and what follows them are all elements of the
attribute of preventing. He, the Exalted, manages His creation
between His Bestowing and Preventing, and all these are
based on perfect wisdom, perfect authority, and perfect praise
and therefore, there is no god but Allah.

The Intelligent Person does not Cling to this Material World

People cling to this worldly life because of the corruption in their
hearts. The hearts of such people are completely centered
round this life and they have no real desire for the Hereafter. It
is not possible in such hearts to implant the deeds that will lead
to the Hereafter. They remain firm in this material world, while
they are cut off from the Hereafter. This is a kind of torment for
them according to the degree to which they cling to this
material world. Therefore, their desires remain stuck to it, and
a barrier is set between them and that which they desire, to the
extent that they lose hope to enjoy their pleasure.

Therefore, the intelligent person will remove the means of this
pain and regret, and will cease to hold onto this worldly life,
just as he takes the initiative to put an end to the causes of
corruption. In spite of this, he will still receive his share of the
world, while his heart is attached to the highest aim. (the
Hereafter). It is only Allah whose Help should be sought.

Chapter: The Evil of Falsehood

Beware of falsehood because it spoils your natural ability to
gain information, and it spoils your formation and your ability to
teach people. The liar describes that which does not exist, and
that which exists he says it does not exist, just as he describes
truth as falsehood and falsehood as truth, and good as evil
and evil 25 good. It spoils his conception and his knowledge,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 9

which become a punishment. Then he describes what is not
true to the person who trusts him. The heart of a liar is far
removed from the truth, and is inclined to that which does not
exist and he prefers falsehood. When his ability to perceive
has been spoiled as well as his knowledge, which is the basis
of every voluntarily deed, these deeds would also be spoiled
and the principle of falsehood would come into force. Therefore,
it would proceed from him just like falsehood proceeds from the
tongue, and so, he would not benefit from either his tongue or
his deeds.

This is the reason why falsehood is the foundation of evil, just
as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Truthfulness leads to
righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. And a
man keeps on telling the truth until he becomes a truthful
person. Falsehood leads to Al-Fajur (i.e. wickedness, evil-
doing), and Al-Fajur (wickedness) leads to the (Hell) Fire,
and a man may keep on telling lies until he is written before
Allah, as a liar.” 3

When falsehood proceeds from the heart to the tongue, it spoils
it, and then it goes to the body, and spoils the good deeds,
just like it spoiled the words of the tongue. Then falsehood
prevails in his words, deeds and state. Therefore, corruption
would become firmly embedded in him and its disease would
extend to a state of destruction if Allah, the Almighty does not
cure him with the remedy of truthfulness, which cuts off evil at
its source.

That is why the origin of all the good deeds of the hearts is
truthfulness, and their opposites such as ostentation, conceit,
arrogance, pride, haughtiness, ingratitude, merrymaking,
weakness, laziness, cowardice, disgrace and so on, have
falsehood 35 their origin. Therefore, the origin of every good

54 Recorded by Al-Bukhary, Kitab Al-Adab, section of the word of Allah, the
Exalted, “"..... ‏الله‎ | sail ‏,ريا أيها الذين آمنوا‎ no. (6094), and Muslim (2606).

230 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

deed, done secretly or openly, is truthfulness. And the Origin of
every evil deed, done secretly or openly, is falsehood.

Allah, the Almighty, in return, rewards the liar by frustrating his
interests, and rewards the truthful by helping him achieve his
interests concerning this world and the Hereafter. Therefore,
nothing can make us benefit more ‏مز‎ this world and the
Hereafter like truthfulness, and in the same way, nothing can
make us earn more evil in this world and the Hereafter like
falsehood. Allah says,

Chapter: “And it may be that you dislike a thing
which is good for you"

‎which means, “And it may be that you dislike a thing which is
good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allah
knows but you do not know.” (Al-Bagarah, 2:216)

‎In this Quranic Verse, there are several judgments, meanings
and benefits for the servant. If the servant knows _ that
misfortune can produce a desirable thing, and that the desirable
thing can produce a misfortune, he would not feel secure
against the harm that can come from delight, and he would not
lose hope of delight to come from harm, for he does not know
the outcomes of things. Verily, it is Allah Who knows about that
which the servant does not know, and in this context the
following issues must be noted:

‎Nothing is more beneficial for him than abiding by the
judgments of Allah, even if it is difficult for him at the beginning,
because all its outcomes are good, delightful, and pleasurable.
In the same way, nothing is more harmful for him than
committing what is forbidden, even if he loves it. All its
outcomes are pain, grief, evil and misfortune.

232 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Furthermore, the mind bears little pain in comparison to the
great pleasure and abundant good that it will experience, and
likewise man is expected to avoid little in exchange for great
rewards and preventing great pain and long term evil.

In this way, we can see that the perception of the ignorant does
not go beyond the basics of life; his perception does not reach
the goals, but the intelligent person always keeps his eye on
the goals behind his actions in life.

The intelligent person perceives forbidden things like delicious
food, which contain fatal poison. Whenever its pleasure arouses
his interest, the reality of the poison would push him away from
it. Also, he perceives the orders of Allah as bitter medicine that
leads to good health and recovery.

Whenever its bitterness urges him not to take it, the reality of
its usefulness leads him to comply. This requires knowledge
that is more than the rudiments of the religion in order to
understand the essential goals. It also requires strong patience
to adjust oneself to it, in order to bear the difficulties that will
be encountered for the sake of the goal. So if he loses
certainty and patience, it would be difficult. to achieve the goal,
and on the other hand if his certainty and patience 15 strong,
every difficulty would be rendered easy for him for the sake of
permanent good and eternal pleasure.

There are other meanings of this verse. It also requires the
servant to leave all his affairs in the Hands of the One Who
knows the outcomes of all things, and to be pleased with
whatever He chooses for him.

Also, the meanings of the verse include the fact that he should
not propose or choose for his Lord, and should not ask Him for
that which he has no knowledge of, for his harm and ruin may
be in it and yet he does not know. He should simply ask his
Lord to choose good for him and make him pleased with His
choice, for that indeed would be the best ending. Also when he

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 3

leaves all his affairs to his Lord, and is satisfied with His choice
for him, Allah will support him by providing him with ability,
determination and patience. He, the Almighty would also keep
him away from the evil that the servant would have encountered
if he had chosen for himself. He would show him some of the
positive outcomes of His Choice, which he would not have
attained if he had chosen for himself.

Such thinking relieves him of the burdens of trying to choose
for himself as Allah frees his heart from estimations and
arrangements, which fluctuate in difficulty. And in spite of this,
the servant would always be surrounded by what was initially
preordained for him. If he is pleased with the Choice of Allah,
the preordainment would grant him what is praiseworthy,
worthy of thanks and worthy of Allah’s Mercy. Otherwise, the
preordainment would incur on him all that is dispraised and
unworthy of Allah’s Mercy, because it was his own choice.
When he truly leaves his affairs to Allah and truly becomes
pleased with that, he would be surrounded by kindness and
care in the preordainment, and he would be under the care
and kindness of Allah. His Kindness protects him from that
which he fears and His Care makes it easy for him to bear that
which He preordained.

When the preordainment is implemented upon the servant, the
greatest cause of its implementation would be his trying to
avoid it. Therefore, there is nothing more beneficial for him than
submission.

Chapter: The Conditions of Being Satisfied with
Knowledge

No one benefits from the Grace of Allah, faith and knowledge
except the person who knows himself, and does not go
beyond his due estimation, and does not say that this is from
me, but is certain that everything is from Allah. Such a person
knows that He is the Real Granter of all things without a cause

234 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

from the servant and without the servant actually deserving it.
Therefore, the Grace of Allah makes the person deeply humble
and he does not see any good at all in or from himself and he
knows that all, which is good comes to him from Allah. So the
Grace of Allah makes him humble and affects him deeply, even
though he may not express it openly.

Therefore, whenever Allah repeatedly bestows grace upon
him, he would become more and more humble, more deeply
affected, more submissive, more loving, more fearing of Allah,
and hopeful of Him. And this is the result of two kinds of noble
knowledge:

His knowledge of his Lord, His Perfection, His Kindness, His
Richness, His Generosity, His Benevolence, His Mercy and that
all good is in His Hands. It is His Kingdom, and He gives to
anyone He wills, and prevents it from anyone He wills. All
praise and thanks are due to Him, and this is the most perfect
praise. After that, comes the servant's own knowledge of
himself, and perceiving his due limits, his just estimation, his
defects, his injustice, his ignorance and that there is no good at
all concerning himself, not in him or from him, and that if he is
left to himself, he will surely destroy himself and be in a state of
ruin. In the same way, his attributes will lead him to complete
ruin, and his essential self is more insignificant and deficient
than it. And any good that he has is related to his existence,
and not to his own inclinations or actions.

When these two kinds of knowledge become an essential part
of his characteristics and not just mere words, then he would
Know that all praise and thanks are due to Allah, and that all
the Commandments and Good belong to Him, and that He is
the Only One Who deserves praise and thanks, and that the
servant of Allah is the one who deserves dispraise and blame.

Whoever failed to gain this knowledge would be inconsistent in
his words, deeds and condition. He would be lost and would

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 235

not be guided to the Straight Way that leads to Allah. So in
order to follow the Straight Way the servant of Allah must
know both kinds of knowledge theoretically and practically.
The following statement illustrates this fact: Anyone who knows
himself, knows his Lord, for the person who knows himself to be
ignorant, unjust, defective, poor and humble, would know his
Lord to be the complete opposite of these attributes. Therefore,
he would acknowledge his due worth, and would not go
beyond his limits. He would praise his Lord as He deserves.
His deep love, fear, hope, repentance and trust would be
turned to his Lord. Allah would be the dearest, the most Feared
and the Most Hopeful to him, and this indeed is the true nature
of worship.

It has been reported that a wise man wrote the following
statement on the door of his house: no one would benefit from
our wisdom except the person who knows himself and does
not go beyond his limits. . Whoever is like this can enter or else
it would be better for him to return until he is qualified.

Chapter: The Danger of Submitting to One’s
Desires

To restrain oneself from fulfilling unlawful desires is easier than
to endure that which is the result of doing so, because giving in
to one’s desires will either cause pain and punishment or it will
prevent a more perfect pleasure than could ever be
experienced in this worldly life. Either it kills time to the extent
that it causes regret, or it defiles honor, whose preservation is
more beneficial and worthy to the servant. Either it takes away
some wealth that would be better to be saved than to be
wasted, or derogate a reputation that would be better to be
praised.

Also it will either remove some grace that would be better to
be preserved, or it debases you and makes you subservient to
lowly people. Also it causes worry, grief, sadness and fear that

236 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

is far more than the pleasure of fulfilling the desire, or it causes
you to forget some knowledge that would be better to be
remembered than satisfying one’s desire. Either it makes an
enemy rejoice and makes a friend sad, or prevents an expected
grace from reaching you, or it causes a flaw or characteristic
that will remain permanently. Indeed deeds are the means of
developing qualities and character.

Chapter: The Limits of One’s Characteristics

Human characteristics have limitations, which if Surpassed,
would be a transgression, and if one falls short of it, it would be
a defect and a disgrace.

Therefore, there is a limitation for anger, which is courage
and disdain for vice and deficiency. This is its perfection but if it
Surpasses that limitation, its owner would be guilty of
transgressing and wrong doing. And if it falls short of him, he
would be a coward and would not have disdain for vice.

Desire has a limitation, which is taking what is sufficient for
this worldly life and the attainment of competency. However,
when it falls short of that, it would be a disgrace and a waste,
and when it surpasses that, it would be greed and a desire for
that which is not praiseworthy.

Envy has a limitation, which is to compete in seeking
perfection and to be unwilling to let someone do better than
oneself. Whoever surpasses that in injustice and transgression,
would wish for other people’s grace to come to an end, and
would seek to harm them. And when it becomes less than the
required limit, it would be lowness and lack of ambition. The
Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Do not wish to be like
anyone except in two cases: (the first is) a person, whom Allah
has given wealth and he spends it righteously; (the second is)

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7

the one whom Allah has given wisdom (the Holy Qur’an) and he
acts according to it and teaches it to others.” 9

This is a kind of emulation that the envier imposes on himself in
order to be like the one he envies, and it is not the disgraceful
kind of envy, in which the envier wishes that the grace of the
envied is removed.

Lust has a limitation, which is relief of the heart and mind from
the toil of obedience, earning good qualities and making use of
them. When it increases to more than its normal state, it would
become a burning desire, and its owner would be on_ the level
of animals. And when it becomes less than that, and is not a
kind of devotion to seek perfection and favor, it would be a
weakness and a disgrace.

Rest has a limitation, which is the revitalization of the self and
one’s perceptive faculties, in order to be ready for religious
duties, earning good qualities and devoting oneself to all that is
good., In this way they do not become weak because 0] toil
and weariness and their effect does not become weak. When it
goes beyond its normal limit, it would be apathy, laziness,
wastefulness and many interests would be lost in this way.
And when it becomes less than required, it would be harmful to
one’s faculties and a means of weakening them, and may
even come to a stop with him.

Generosity has a limitation, and it lies between two extremes.
When it surpasses its limit, it becomes extravagance, and
when it becomes less than the required limit, it is stinginess
and miserliness.

Courage has a limitation, and when it surpasses it, it would be
rashness, and when it becomes less than the required limit, it

would be cowardice and weakness. Its limit is to boldly engage
on occasions that require courage, and to refrain on the
occasions that require refraining. This is like what Mu’awiyah
said to ‘Umar, “I have failed to understand whether you are
courageous 01 a coward; you expose yourself to danger and
risk to the extent that | say that you are one of the bravest
people, and you become so frightened to the extent that | Say
that you are one of the most cowardly people”. Thereupon, he
answered,

Courage when there is an occasion
And a coward when there is no occasion

Jealousy has a limitation, which when surpassed is a
blameworthy and evil thought about the innocent, and when it
becomes less than the required limit, it would be carelessness
and indifference concerning one’s honor.

Humility has a limitation, which when surpassed would be
lowness and disgrace. And when it is less than the required
limit, it would turn to arrogance and pride.

Glory has a limitation, which when surpassed would be
arrogance and a dispraised character. And when it is less than
the required limit, it would turn to lowness and disgrace.

Moderation is the Best Way to Deal with all Matters

Controlling all these emotions with moderation is to adopt the
middle way between the two extremes. The interests of this
worldly life and the Hereafter are based on this, and not only
that, but it is the standard to which the body can work
effectively.

If any of its elements are diverted from moderation, and are
caused to exceed beyond its due limits or became less than it,
Its good health would decrease accordingly. Besides, it includes
all natural acts, such as sleeping, staying up at night, eating,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 9

drinking, copulation, movement, sport, privacy, social
intercourse and so on. If moderation is not achieved it would
become a defect. Among the noblest and the most beneficial
kinds of knowledge, is the knowledge of limitations, especially
legal limits; wnat is commanded and what is forbidden. The
most knowledgeable person is the most knowledgeable of
these ordained limits, for he is not confused about that which
belongs to them and that which does not. Allah, the Almighty
said in the Noble Qur’an,

which means, “The Bedouins are the worst in disbelief and
hypocrisy, and more likely to be in ignorance of the limits
(Allah's Commandments and His Legal Laws, etc.) which Allah
has revealed to His Messenger.” (At-Tawbah, 9:97)

Therefore, the most moderate person is the one who takes care
of the limits of manners, deeds and legalities, in terms of
learning and practicing them.

Chapter: Piety within the heart

Abu Ad-Darda’’® (may Allah be pleased with him) said, "Pious
people are good both in cases of sleep or breaking fast. How
can they envy the evil ones for their fasting and night prayers.
The smallest amount of piety from a righteous person is better
than worship the size of mountains from proud people." These
great words show the perfection of the jurisprudence of the

piety. He memorized the whole Qur'an at the time of the Prophet (peace be
upon him). He passed away in Syria in 32 A.H. See Usd Al-Ghabah, vol.4,

Companions and their superiority over whoever came atter
them, (may Allah be pleased with them all).

You should know that the servant stops seeking Allah through
his heart and intention and not through his body. In reality piety
is in the heart and not in the body. Allah says,

دار ار

( ذَلِكَ وَمَن ‎Be‏ سْعَِيرَآلّهِ ‎LE‏ من تقوف القلوب ‎4D‏

which means, "Thus it is an obligation that mankind owes to
Allah]. And whosoever honors the Symbols of Allah, then it is
truly from the piety of the heart." (Al-Hajj, 22:32)

And He, the Almighty says,
4 ‏ص1 ل حم ص ع تر‎ cote ‏سرس هد م عع رت ا‎
© 2220... ‏منكم‎ oR ILS ‏وَلدكن‎ Lan ‏وَلا‎ a gd ‏الله‎ OG ‏لن‎ «

which means, "It is neither their meat nor their blood that

Hajj, 22:37) ‏ظ‎

And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "The piety is here,

Straight path with his intention, great desire, and faithful
determination with little effort and this is many times more than
he who has none of these qualities ; such a person will
experience much tiredness and hard travel, whereas the pious
servant's intention and love remove all tiredness and beautify
the journey he is on. Walking and proceeding to Allah, the
Exalted is done through intention, sincere desire, and
determination. Whoever has the intention even without the

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 1

deeds will precede whoever has lots of deeds but no intention.
This matter requires a lot of explanation.

The Most perfect guidance:

The most perfect guidance is that of the Messenger of Allah
(peace be upon him). This guidance gives Allah and the
Prophet their rights. The Prophet besides being perfect, has a
strong will and he used to perform the optional nightly prayer
until his feet swelled, and he would fast until they would say,
"He did not break his fast," and he would fight in the cause of
Allah, mix with his companions and never avoid them, and he
never neglected any optional acts of worship or supplications
which are things that people cannot bear. Allah, the Exalted
ordered His servants to fulfill both the laws of Islam and the
realities of faith; one of them cannot exist without the other.

lt was recorded in Musnad, "Islam is open and faith is in the
heart."°® So Islam is open and its owner does not reach the
real hidden faith through it, and every real hidden faith that its
owner does not perform (the open law of Islam), is useless
regardless of its reality. If the heart is torn out of love and fear
while the servant is not worshiping Allah and performing the
open acts of worship, this will not save him from the Hellfire.
Also if he only performs open deeds of Islam and does not
have any real hidden faith within him, he will never be saved
from the Hellfire.

lf this becomes clear, then truthful people wno seek Allah and
the Hereafter are of two types:

One party spent what remains of their time after performing
obligatory acts of worship in physical optional acts of worship
and make that their habit without observing the deeds of the
heart, its level, and judgments. They have the origin of real

55 Weak hadith, recorded by Ahmad in his musnad, n.3/134, Al-Albany
approved its weakness in Al-Jami', no.2280.

242 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

hidden deeds but their intentions are all wasted. The other party
spent what remains of their time after performing obligatory acts
of worship in caring for the goodness of their hearts and
seeking Allah alone. They make the power of their worship in
the deeds of the heart by correcting their love, fear, hope, trust,
and regret and find that the fewest supplications that they recite
are preferred to them than a lot of physical optional deeds,
which are not based in the heart. Whoever is granted this
blessing from Allah and his heart seeks Allah alone either by
love, fear, humiliation, or longing for Allah, he must not replace
this feeling with anything else except by performing obligatory
acts of worship even if this feeling is no longer present. But
there is a hesitation concerning optional acts of worship; if he
can he may perform them while having this feeling but if he is
going to loose it, he should think about what is more preferable
to Allah: is it by performing this optional act of worship even if
his feeling is gone like helping a needy one, guiding a sinner,
etc? Here he should prefer the optional act of worship and if he
presents it to Allan seeking Him alone and seeking His
closeness, Allah will grant him the feelings he had lost and
even better than they were. But if this feeling is better than the
optional deed, he should stick to it until it goes and then
perform the optional act of worship, as feelings go away but
optional acts do not have a special time.

This subject requires knowledge of jurisprudence, and the
levels of deeds, and their importance. May Allah grant success,
there is no god but Him.

Chapter: The Origin of Praised and Dispraised
Morals

The origin of all dispraised morals is pride, disgrace, and
lowness and the origin of all praised morals is piety and having
high and lofty intentions. Arrogance, ingratitude, slander, vanity,
envy, injustice, cruelty, tyranny, disobedience, refusing advice,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

obsession, seeking and loving authority and power, and to be
praised for what he did not do are all caused by pride.

Lying, meanness, treason, hypocrisy, cunning, deception,
greediness, fright, cowardice, miserliness, weakness, laziness,
humility to other than Allah, and replacing what is better with
what is worse, are qualities from disgrace and lowness,

while virtuous morals like patience, courage, justice, chivalry,
abstinence, generosity, tolerance, forgiveness, bearing,
unselfishness, raising oneself above lowness, humility,
satisfaction, truth, sincerity, rewarding others for their good
deeds with the same or better and neglecting their slips,
abandoning what is useless, and purifying the heart from all
dispraised morals are things that arise from piety and having
high and lofty intentions. Allah, the Exalted informed us about
the barren earth, when He sends down water (rain) to it, it is
stirred to life and growth (of vegetation). The same occurs with
creatures, which are created from the earth, when they get their
share of Ajlah’s blessings. Dispraised morals are like the fire
that is high when it is well but when it goes out, it is low and
mean. Good morals are like the earth and its creatures.
Whoever has a high intention and is pious, will have every
good moral and whoever is low and mean, will acquire every
bad vice.

Chapter: The Requirements of Achieving Great
Targets

Achieving high aims depends upon having a firm intention and
a strong will. Whoever looses them will never attain his goals,
because when one’s intention is firm, it adheres to the plan
and if one’s will is strong, the servant will walk along the right
way that leads to that aim. Having a strong will opens the way
and a resolute intention focuses one on the aim. If his aim
coincides with the way that reaches to it, he will be successful.
If his intention is weak he will not have a high aim. If his will is

244 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

not strong, it will not lead him to his aim. The whole matter
depends upon the will and intention of the servant and they will
never be achieved without neglecting three matters:

First: innovations, which people make.

Second: abandoning worldly benefits and vain pleasures.
which hinder him from his way and aim.

Third: purify one’s heart from any vain desires that will distract
his intention.

Chapter: The Wisdom of Ibn Mas'dd

One of the sayings of Ibn Mas'dd (may Allah be pleased with
him) was that a man said in his presence, "I do not like to be
from among the companions of the right hand, but | would like
to be from among those who are nearest to Allah." ‘Abdullah
said, "But there is a servant here, who wishes that when he dies
he will not be resurrected again (meaning himself)."

He went out one day, and some people followed him, so he
asked them, "Do you need anything?" They said, "No, but we
want to walk with you (as your followers)." He said, "Go back:
you are humiliating yourselves and may do so to me.”

And he said, “If you knew about me what | knew about myself,
you would pour dust upon my head." And he said, "١ preferred
the two unpleasant matters: death and poverty; by Allah they
are in reality wealth and life, and | do not care which of them |
may be afflicted with, as | will seek Allah in each of them: if it is
wealth, it means | am going to meet Allah, and if it is poverty, |
will be patient."

And he said, "As you walk in the night and day your age
decreases and your deeds are recorded, and death will come
suddenly. Whoever sows good deeds, he will harvest
goodness, and whoever sows evil deeds, he will harvest
regret. Everyone will reap what he sows; he will neither

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 5

precede a slow man according to his fortune nor catch up with
an eager man unless it is destined for him.

e Whoever does good, must know that it is Allah, who
allowed him to do so, and whoever is protected from
evil, must know that it is Allah, who protected him.

e Pious people are masters, jurists are leaders, and
accompanying them will increase your good.

e They are two: guidance and speech. The best speech is
the words of Allah and the best guidance is that of
Muhammad (peace be upon him). The worst matter of
all is innovations and every innovation is a novelty, so
do not be disturbed by hopes and do not waste time.
Whatever is coming is near at hand and whatever is far
will not come. Whoever is unhappy was destined to be
so, when he was in his mother's womb and the happy
servant is the one who takes the examples of others.
Killing a Muslim is disbelief, abusing him is an evil doing
and the Muslim is not allowed to abandon his brother
Muslim for more than three days; he must greet him
when he meets him, answer him when he calls him,
and visit him when he is ill. The most evil account is that
of lying. Lying contains no good, neither in cases of
seriousness nor joking nor when a man promises his
son something and does not fulfill it. Falsehood leads to
wickedness and evil doing, and wickedness leads to the
Hellfire and Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and
righteousness leads to Paradise. It would be said to the
truthful person that he was truthful and pious, and it
would be said to the lying person that he was lying and
wicked. Muhammad (peace be upon him) said to us,
"And a man keeps on telling the truth until he becomes a
truthful person and a man may keep on telling lies until
he is written before Allah as a liar."

246 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

e The most truthful speech is the Book of Allah, the most
correct word is the word of piety, the best religion is that
of Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him), the best
Sunnah is the sunnah of Muhammad (peace be upon
him), the best guidance is the guidance of the Prophets,
the most honorable talk is remembering Allah, the best
account is the Qur'an, the best matters are its
consequences, and the worst matter is innovation.
Whatever is little but sufficient is better than what is a
lot but distracting. A soul that you save from evil is
better than an emirate that you cannot control. The
worst excuse is when it is the time of death and the
worst regret is on the Day of Resurrection. The worst
error is that which is done after guidance. The best
wealth is the wealth of the soul. The best provision is
piety. The best content of the heart is certainty, and
doubt is disbelief. The worst blindness is blindness of
the heart. Wine is a collection of evil, and unrighteous
women are the traps of Satan. Adolescence is a kind of
insanity, and wailing is a deed from the pre-Islamic era.

٠ Among people are those who attend Friday prayer and
hardly pay attention to it and remember Allah with his
tongue but not with his heart. The gravest sin is lying,
and whoever pardons people Allah will pardon him.
Whoever restrains his anger, Allah will reward him, and
whoever forgives, Allah will forgive him. Whoever is
patient during disasters, Allah will recompense him. The
worst of profits is usury, and the worst kind of eating is
devouring an orphan's property. Whatever satisfies the
soul, is enough for you. The destiny of each of you is
the grave. Matters depend upon their consequences.
The most honorable way of dying is the death of a
martyr. Whoever is proud, Allah will humiliate him, and
whoever disobeys Allah, will obey Satan.

People who have memorized the Qur'an should be
known by the night when people are sleeping and he is
awake, and by the morning when people are not fasting
but he is, by his sadness when they are happy, by his
crying when they are laughing, by his silence when they
are slandering, and by his piety and humility when they
are arrogant. He who has memorized the Qur'an
should be tearful, sad, wise, patient, and calm, he
should not be rude, inattentive, loud or cruel.

Whoever assaults others because of his authority, Allah
will degrade him. Whoever is humble because of his
piety, Allah will elevate him. Allah has a gathering and
Satan has a gathering. The gathering of Allah promises
good and believes in right, while the gathering of Satan
threatens evil and doubts right. If you see such a
gathering seek refuge with Allah.

People have many good sayings, and whoever’s words
agree with his deeds, he would have been granted
goodness, and whoever’s sayings contradict his deeds,
he is simply scolding himself.

| hate to find a lazy, empty man, who neither works for
his worldly living nor for the Hereafter. He whose prayer
did not command him to do right and did not forbid him
from doing wrong. It will not be of any use to him; it will
only increase the distance between him and Allah.

Undoubtedly one should never please people by
displeasing Allah, should not praise anyone for that
which Allah had bestowed on you, and never blame
anyone for that which Allah did not grant you. The
blessings of Allah will not be gained according to
someone's desires nor will they be removed because of
someone's hatred. Allah in His justice and patience

248 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

makes the soul happy by being content, and makes
sadness and grief when one doubts and is discontent.

e As long as you are performing prayer, you are knocking
at the door of Allah, and whoever is knocking at the door
of Allah, Allah will open it for him.

٠» Man almost forgets the knowledge he has gained
because of the sins he has committed.

e Do not neglect knowledge and guidance, or the light of
night, renewed hearts, and wearing worn clothes. In this
way you will be known in the heavens and hidden from
the people of the earth.

¢ The hearts of man pass through two phases: activity and
inactivity, 50 seek your hearts while they are in the state
of activity and control them in the phase of inactivity.

e Knowledge is not being able to narrate several accounts
but by being pious.

٠ The disbeliever may have a stronger and healthier body
but he has the sickest heart among them, and the
believer has the healthiest heart among people but
perhaps the weakest body. By Allah, if your hearts are
sick and your bodies are healthy, you would be lower
than an insect in the sight of Allah.

٠ The servant of Allah will not reach the reality of faith
until he reaches its top, and he will not reach its top until
poverty becomes preferable to him more than wealth,
humility more preferable than honor, and until the one
who praises or dispraises him are equal in his sight.
Man comes out of his house with his religion and returns
with nothing. A person comes to you while he cannot
do anything for you nor your soul, either good or bad,
and swore by Allah to others that he is good and he

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 249

flatters you, and he returns and does nothing from
what he wanted and Allah is not pleased with him.

If | mocked at a dog, | would be afraid of being
changed into one.

Sin is whatever the heart is not comfortable with.
In every look, Satan will seduce you.

With happiness comes sadness. Every house that once
was filled with joy will be faced with examples and each
one of you is a guest and his money is a loan; the guest
will travel and the loan will be repaid.

Later in time there will be nations whose best deeds
will be reciting among themselves and listening to evil
reciters.

lf man wanted to be treated justly by his soul, he should
visit those whom he would like to be visited by. The right
is heavy but healthy, and evil is light but harmful.

Perhaps one desire causes long term sadness.

There is nothing on earth that badly needs to be
imprisoned more than the tongue.

If adultery and usury appeared in a town or village, itis a
sign of its coming destruction.

Whoever could put his treasure in heaven so that it
would neither be eaten by worms nor stolen by thieves;
he must do so, as the heart of man is his treasure.

Do not imitate anyone concerning religion; if he believes

disbelieve. If you must imitate, you should imitate dead
people as the living are not protected from seduction.

e None of you should be weak. They said, "What do you
mean by weak?” He said, "He says, ‘| am with the
people; if they are on the right way | will be on the right
way and if they go astray | will go astray. One should
adjust himself to adhere to Islam even when people
disbelieve."

A man said to him, "Teach me words that are complete
and useful." He said, "Worship Allah and do not worship
any partners with Him, adhere to the Qur'an whatever it
says, and whoever calls you to the right accept it from
him even if he is far from you and odious, and whoever
calls you to what is wrong reject him even if he is a
lover and close to you.”

e The servant of Allah will be brought on the Day of
Resurrection and he would be ordered to render back
his trust, and he would say, "O My Lord! From where?
The worldly life has gone." Then this trust would be
shaped as it had been during this worldly life but it will
be in the bottom of Hellfire, and he would fall down after
it, put it on his shoulder, and begin to come up until he
thought that he is about to come out, but it would fall
again and he would fall after it forever.”

e Submit your heart in three situations: when listening to
the Qur'an, during gatherings of remembering Allah, and
during times of solitude. If you do not find your heart in
these three situations, ask Allah to grant you with a

Al-Junaid said, "| visited a youth, who asked me about
repentance and its reality. | answered him and said, ‘To

the reality of repentance’, so | said to him, ‘What is the
reality of repentance according to you?' He said, To

asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) “O Abu AI-

what the youth said.' He said, 'How is that?' He said, ‘If |

this to a state of devotion, then remembering alienation
when one is devoted, is alienation.”

Chapter: Sincerity and Love that are Praised
cannot Coexist

Sincerity and love that are praised cannot coexist in one heart
just like water and fire cannot coexist. If you urge yourself to
seek sincerity, you should kill greed first by using a knife made
of despair, and you should neglect praise and thanks and be
ascetic like asceticism in this worldly life. If you killed greed
and abandoned praise and thanks, sincerity would be easy for
yOu.

! you said, "What will help me to kill greed and abandon praise
and thanks?" You can say, "What will help you 10 kill greed is
by surely knowing that every matter that the servant could be
greedy about is in the hands of Allah, and surely no one else
has the keys to this lock. Allah alone can bestow it upon His
servant. The servant should know that there is neither praise
nor thanks nor dispraise or blame that can harm you or be
useful to you except that of Allah. Once a Bedouin said to the
Prophet (peace be upon him), "My praise beautifies and my
dispraise disgraces.' He said, ‘The one who can do that is Allah,

apartments, "O Muhammad! My praise beautifies and my dispraise disgraces.'

praises of you will not beautify you, and do not dispraise the
one whose dispraise will not disgrace you. Only praise the One
whose beauty is in His praise and disgrace is in His dispraise.
This cannot be done except through being patient and having
firm belief. Whenever you lose patience and belief, you will be
like the one who wanted to travel by sea without a boat. Allah,

Chapter: Pleasure Depends upon Determination

The pleasure of each one of us depends upon his value,
determination, and honor. The one who has the most
honorable soul, the firmest determination, and is the most
valuable among people is the one who finds his pleasure in
knowing Allah, loving Him, longing to meet Him, and pleasing

Qawéa'id Al-Ahkam, vol.1, 9.162, that some people said to the Prophet (peace
be upon him), "O Muhammad! Give me, as my praise beautifies and my
dispraise disgraces.' He said, 'The one who can do that is the Lord of all the
worlds."

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 253

Him by doing what He likes; his pleasure is in seeking Allah and
dedicating his determination to Him. Below that there are
several ranks that only Allah knows their numbers, until the
ranks end with he whose pleasure is in seeking the most mean
and low matters from among all kinds of indecency: in speech,
deeds, and works. If the pleasure of the first rank was offered to
him, his soul would neither accept it nor pay any attention to it
and maybe his soul would suffer from it, as whoever is in the
first rank will neither accept the pleasure of that in the last rank
nor pay attention to it.

Whoever experiences the most complete pleasure among
people is the one who gathers the pleasures of the body, heart
and soul. He is enjoying his lawful pleasures in a way that is
neither decreasing his reward in the Hereafter nor depriving him
from the pleasure of knowledge and being close to Allah. Such
a person is from among those about whom Allah says,

“
cond ee ‏ببس‎ we le

« قل من حرّم زينة الله ‎Gl‏ اخرج ‎costal‏ وَالطيبا لطيّبمت ‎Se‏ الرزق قل هىّ للددين َامنوا

which means, "Say (O Muhammad): "Who has forbidden the
adoration with clothes given by Allah, which He has produced
for his slaves, and At-Taiyibat [all kinds of Halal (lawful) things]
of food?" Say: “They are, in the life of this world, for those who
believe, (and) exclusively for them (believers) on the Day of
Resurrection (the disbelievers will not share them)." (Al-A'raf,
7:32)

Whoever has the lowest share of pleasure is the one, who
enjoys it in a way that deprives him of the pleasures of the
Hereafter and is like those about whom Allah Says on the Day
of Resurrection,

a j ‏م‎

254 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

which means, "You received your good things in the life of the
world, and you took your pleasure therein." (Al-Ahqaf, 46:20)

Both parties enjoyed their pleasures but in different ways.
Some enjoyed them in a way that is permissible, so they
gathered the pleasures of this worldly life and the Hereafter.
Others enjoyed them according to their desires and either they
were permissible or not, so they were deprived of the
pleasures of this worldly life and missed the pleasures of the
Hereafter. Neither the pleasures of this worldly life lasted nor
the pleasures of the Hereafter. Whoever wants pleasure, its
continuance, and a good life, should use the pleasure of this
worldly life to take him to the pleasure of the Hereafter. That
means to use it to dedicate his heart to Allah, His orders, and
to worship Him; to use this pleasure as an aid and power to
helo him fulfill his aim not just some desires. If he was among
those who were deprived of the pleasures of this worldly life, he
should seek what he missed in the pleasures of the Hereafter
and control himself during this life by abandoning in order to
gain them ail in the Hereafter. The pleasures of this worldly life
are the best supporters and helpers for whoever truly seeks
Allah and the Hereafter and dedicates his determination to what
is in the Hereafter. Missing the pleasures of this life is the best
helper for he who seeks Allah and the Hereafter, and whoever
enjoys the benefits of life in a way that will not decrease his
share of pleasures in the Hereafter, he will enjoy both pleasures
but if he does not he will lose everything.

The Results of Abandoning Sins

Glorified be Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. If we consider the
results of abandoning sins, we would cease to commit sins.
Abandoning sins will result in raising one’s magnanimity,
protecting honor, keeping glory, and preserving wealth, which
Allah makes for our benefit during this worldly life and the
Hereafter, having the love of creatures, judging between them,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings © 255

a good way of living, granting relief to the body, strength to the
heart, relief to the soul, joy to the heart, delight to the chest,
being safe from the dangers of dissoluteness and wantonness,
having only a little sadness, grief, and distress, honoring the
soul by not accepting humiliation, protecting the light of the
heart by being turned away from the darkness of sin, showing
the way to the heart which cannot be seen by the disbelievers,
providing subsistence from sources that we could never
imagine, making easy whatever is hard for the disbelievers,
helping him to obey, aiding he who is learning, and increasing
other's supplications for him. This is all regardless of what he
gains like beauty, glory in the hearts of peopie, support and
protection from others if he was hurt, protection of his honor if
he was slandered, answering his supplication and being close
to Allah, and close to the Angels and being far from the Satans
among the humans and the jinn. People will compete to serve
him and fulfill his needs and to gain his love and company. He
will not fear death but he will be happy to meet Allah and
receive his reward. The world will be low in his eyes while the
Hereafter will be great. He will seek the greatest property,
supreme achievement in the Hereafter, tasting the sweetness of
obedience, the sweetness of faith, the supplications of the
angels that carry the Throne and the other angels around him,
the happiness of the two angels that are recording his deeds
and their supplications, an increase of knowledge,
understanding, and faith, loving Allah, longing to meet Him and
happiness at his repentance. Allah will reward him with
happiness and joy that are not even close to the happiness
experienced when committing sins.

These are some of the results that are gained in this worldly life
when the servant abandons sins. If he dies, the Angels will
meet him announcing the good news from his Lord that he will
enter Paradise and that there is neither fear nor grief for him.
He will leave the prison of this life to go to the garden of
Paradise; enjoying its pleasures until the Day of Resurrection.

And on the Day of Resurrection, while the peopie will be
sweating and hot he will be in the shade of the Throne, and
when they are gone, he will be taken by the right hand with his
pious companions and the successful party. Allah says,

Chapter: The Piety of ‘Umar bin ‘Abdul ‘Aziz

lbn Sa’ad © said in At-Tabagat about ‘Umar bin ‘Abdul ‘Aziz ‏؟‎
‎that when he delivered a speech on the pulpit and feared to be
touched with conceit, he would stop the speech. And when he
wrote a note and feared conceit, he would tear it up and say, “O
Allah, | seek refuge with you from the evil of myself.”

You should know that when a servant begins a speech or
deed, with which Allah’s Pleasure is sought, seeking Allah’s
Favor upon him and His Good Fortune for him, and that it 5
from Allah and not from him or his knowledge, thought, might

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7

and strength, and moreover, it is He who created the tongue,
then the heart, the eye and the ear are for him.

Therefore, He who favored him with that is the One Who
favored him with the ability to speak and act. If he keeps this in
his mind and heart, he would not be caught in the trap of
conceit, whose origin is overt consideration of oneself, and
taking no consideration of his Lord’s Favor, Good Fortune and
Support.

If these remarks are far away from his heart and mind, his self
would assert itself, and there would be conceit, and his speech
and deeds would be corrupted. At times, he would be hindered
from completing his task, and this would be mercy upon him, so
that he does not forget to consider the Favor and Good Fortune
provided by Allah. And at other times, he would be able to
complete it, but he would have no fruit, and if he has fruit, it
would be weak, and not as he had desired. At other times, its
harm would be more than its benefit, and there would be a lot of
evil according to his negligence of good fortune and favor, and
his conceit. According to this situation, Allah, the Almighty
directs His servant to righteous speech and deeds, so as to
enlarge their fruit for him or frustrate them for him and prevent
him from the fruit. Therefore, nothing is more harmful to deeds
than conceit and seeing oneself as actually the Originator of
one’s deeds.

Therefore, when Allah wills good for His servant, He makes
him witness His Favor, Good Fortune and Support for him in
everything he says or does, and then he would not be
conceited. And then He would make him witness his
carelessness, and he would repent to Him and seek His
Forgiveness and become shy to ask for a reward.

On the contrary, if He concealed it from him, and the servant
found himself to be indispensable for the performance of his
deeds, and found himself to be perfect and became self

258 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

satisfied, his deeds would not be accepted, or gain the
satisfaction of Allah.

Therefore, the person who he profoundly knowledgeable about
Allah performs deeds for the sake of Allah, while observing in
them His Favor, Grace and Good Fortune, repenting for any
defect and being shy in front of Allah for failing to give Him His
due right. The ignorant people perform deeds for the sake of
their own vain desires and interests, observing themselves in
them, and regarding them as a favor to his Lord and being
satisfied with his deeds. Therefore, this is one category and
that is another category, and they are far from each other.

Chapter: The Benefits of Deserting Evil Habits

In order to attain the pleasure of Allah, one should desert all
bad habits and abandon anything that hinders one from
achieving this goal. And "‘Awa‘id" means: to enjoy the pleasure
of living in gentleness, relaxation, and that which people are
used to as forms and situations that people have adopted and
placed them in the position of Islamic law. They disapprove of
the person who violates them, but do not disapprove of the one
who violates clear Islamic law. They might accuse the person of
unbelief, heresy or perversity. They might as well abandon him
and punish him for violating these forms.

For the sake of these forms, they have abandoned the
Prophet's Sunnah (peace be upon him), and they made them
equal to the Messenger (peace be upon him) by supporting
them. Therefore, the good for them is that which is in conformity
with these forms and the bad is that which differs from them.

These situations and forms have prevailed among different
groups of people like kings, leaders, Islamic jurists, the poor,
those who command good and forbid bad and the common
people. Children have grown up in this environment, and adults
have been educated according to them, and they have adopted

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ® 259

them as ways of life, and moreover, they are dearer to them
than the Prophet’s Sunnah. Those who support these forms are
shut off from the right path, and those who have abided by them
have separated themselves from the Prophet’s Sunnah.
Whoever adopts them will be disappointed with Allah, the
Almighty, and whoever follows them without the Book of Allah
and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him), will not
be accepted by Allah. These are the greatest barriers and
obstacles between the servant and being close to Allah and His
Prophet (peace be upon him).

Chapter: Hindrances

There are open and secret hindrances. They hinder the heart
from its advancement to Allah and prevent it from its course.
There are three kinds: polytheism, innovation in religion and
wrongdoing. The hindrance of polytheism disappears with pure
monotheism, the hindrance of innovation in religion disappears
with the adoption of the Sunnah, and the hindrance of
wrongdoing disappears with repentance.

These hindrances do not become clear to the servant until he is
ready and constant in obeying Allah. By then, these
hindrances would appear to him, and he would feel them
according to the degree of determination and _ sincerity in his
commitment to Allah. Otherwise, as long as he has not taken
any step towards Allah, he would not see or feel any hindrance
at all.

Chapter: Attachments

Attachments are everything that the heart gets deeply attached
to, besides Allah and His Messenger, like worldly pleasures,
desires, leadership, being in the company of people and loving
them. There is no way at all to cut off or reject these three
matters except by strong attachment to the highest issue. Man
does not abandon his beloved or that which he is used to,

260 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

except for the sake of another beloved one who is dearer to him
than the former. And whenever his attachment to his desires
becomes stronger, his attachment to others would be weaker,
and vice versa. To be attached to desires is to have a strong
desire for them, and that is according to one’s knowledge
about it, its honor and its excellence.

Chapter: The Status of the Messenger (peace be
upon him)

When the Messenger (peace be upon him) perfected the
feeling of great need for Allah, the Almighty, He made him
necessary to all the creatures in this world and in the Hereafter.
Their need for him in this world is stronger than their need for
food, drink and air with which they live. Their need for him in the
Hereafter means they would seek his intercession with Allah in
order to free them from the suffering of that critical day. All of
them would be unable to intercede, but he would intercede for
them, and he is the one who would ask for the door of Paradise
to be opened for them.

Chapter: Signs of Happiness and Misfortune

some of the signs of happiness and success are that whenever
the servant's knowledge has been increased, he would be more
humble and more merciful. Whenever he becomes more
knowledgeable, he would fear Allah more and be more
cautious. Whenever he gets older, he would be less greedy.
Whenever he becomes wealthier, he would be more generous.
Whenever he becomes more important, he would be closer to
the people, and be more and more at their service.

The signs of misfortune are that whenever he becomes more
knowledgeable, he would be more arrogant. Whenever he
performs more deeds, he would be more boastful, disdain
people and have a very good opinion of himself. When he gets
older, ne would be greedier. Whenever he becomes wealthier,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 1

he would be stingier and whenever he becomes more
important, he would be more conceited. These are trials from
Allah, the Almighty to try His servants, and according to these
trials, some people become happy and others become
miserable.

In the same way, wonders are trials and tests from Allah, like
sovereignty, authority and wealth. Allah, the Almighty — said
about His Prophet Sulaiman (Solomon) (peace be upon him),
when he saw the throne of Balais,

Fe 78) 21 5 Bie ‏دوا . د‎ we > 7 oo
4 Bd ‏آم أكفر‎ Ele GG GO ed ‏ين‎ Lb... «

which means, "This is by the Grace of my Lord to test me
whether | am grateful or ungrateful!” (An-Naml, 27:40)

That is to say grace is a trial and test from Allah, in order to
bring to light the gratitude of the grateful and the ingratitude of
the ungrateful.

In the same way, ordeals are a severe trial from Him, Exalted
be He. He afflicts with grace as well as with misfortune. The
following Quranic verses will illustrate this fact,

” See?

‎enn‏ 2 قا م ‎assy‏ فقول نف ‎Thy eS Df‏ ,13 ما

‎which means, “As for man, when his Lord tries him by giving
him honour and gifts, then he says (puffed up): "My Lord has
honoured me.” But when He tries him, by straitening his means
of life, he says: "My Lord has humiliated me!" Nay! But you treat
not the orphans with kindness and generosity (i.e. you neither
treat them well, nor give them their exact right of inheritance)!”
(Al-Fajr, 89:15-17)

262 * AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

That is to say that honor and gifts from Allah do not always
mean that He is pleased with the servant, and at the same time,
straightening the means of life for the servant does not always
mean he is being degraded.

Chapter: Deeds are an Establishment whose
Foundation is Faith

Whoever wants his establishment to be high, should
consolidate its foundation and take great care of it, because it
is according to the consolidation of the foundation that his
establishment can reach the heights and stay firm. Therefore,
deeds and grades are considered as an establishment and its
foundation is faith. Whenever the foundation is firm, it would be
able to hold the establishment and add more to it. And when
any part of the establishment is destroyed, it would be easy to
repair. However, when the foundation is not firm enough, the
establishment would not be able to be constructed, and would
not be stable. When any part of the foundation is destroyed, the
establishment would collapse or would not stay long before it is
destroyed.

The person who is profoundly knowledgeable of Allah would be
interested in consolidating the foundation and strengthening it.
And the ignorant person would be interested in constructing but
without taking care of the foundation, and in no time, his
establishment would collapse. Allah, the Almighty said in the
Qur'an,

‎sf 74 | * 2‏ و

‏شفا جرفي ‎GU la‏ بهء فى ار ‎Age‏ 4222

‎0

‎ta — 81 ih >‏ عل تَقَوَى مرت

‎which means, “ls it then he, who laid the foundation of his
building on piety to Allah and His Good Pleasure, better, or he
who laid the foundation of his building on an undetermined brink

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

of a precipice ready to crumble down, so that it crumbled to
pieces with him into the Fire of Hell?” (At-Tawbah, 9:109)

Therefore, the foundation regarding the establishment of deeds
is like energy for the human body. If there is enough energy, it
would be able to maintain the body and prevent many
diseases. However, if there is not enough energy, it would fail
to maintain the body, and diseases would find their way to it
very easily.

For this reason, you should found your deeds on a basis of
strong faith, and if anything happens to this strong faith after
that, it would be easy to cope with it. And this basis is
comprised of two matters:

One is: to have good knowledge of Allah, His Orders and His
Beautiful Names and Attributes.

Two is: to have pure submission to Him and His Messenger
(peace be upon him) and leave other than Him. This is the
strongest foundation a servant can found his deeds on, and
according to it, his faith would increase and increase.

Therefore, strengthen the foundation, preserve your faith,
continue to be zealous for your faith, spare no effort when
things are too much for you, be moderate when you achieve
your goal, otherwise, you would always have weak faith and an
evil intention and you would not be able to exert any effort.

Say goodbye to this worldly life because the final Farewell is
close at hand. When the construction is complete, you should
decorate it with good manners and kindness to people, then
surround it with a fence of caution that is impossible to be
broken through by an enemy, and let there be no defect to be
seen through it. And then draw the curtains around its doors,
and close the gate with silence from that which you fear. Then
install a key to it, like remembering Allah, with which you can
open and close it as you like. When you open the door, you

264 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

open it with the key, and when you close it, you close it with the
same key. In this way, you would have built a stronghold with
which you have fortified yourself from your enemies. When the
enemy went around it, he would not find any entrance, so, he
would be disappointed with you.

You should continue to take care of the stronghold at all times,
because if the enemy failed to enter from the door, he would
initiate for you a way of committing sins from a far distance.

Therefore, if you neglect him, these sins would reach you, and
you would soon see the enemy with you in the stronghold, and
it would be very difficult for you to get rid of him, and one of the
following will apply to you:

- Either he overcomes you in the stronghold and takes
possession of tt

- Or he lives with you in it.

- Or he keeps you busy by making you fight him without
taking care of your more significant interests.

However, if he is able to get to you through committing sins, he
would cause you three problems:

- He would ruin your stronghold.
- He would invade its contents and supplies.

- He would show the defect to thieves of his kind. You
would continue to suffer from their invasions one after
the other, until they weaken your strength and
undermine your determination, and you would end up by
abandoning the stronghold and leaving it to them.

This is the state of affairs of many people with the enemy. That
Is why you see them displeasing their Lord by pleasing
themselves, and moreover, by pleasing a creature like
themselves, which has_ no power either to harm them or to do

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 5

them any good. They waste the gain of religion with the gain of
wealth. They ruin themselves with that which is transient and
will not remain with them.

They rush after the worldly pleasures, while it gives its back to
them. They renounce the Hereafter, while it has charged them.
They contradict their Lord by following their own vain desires.
They rely on life and forget about death. They remember their
desires and shares, and forget about that which Allah charged
them with, and they care for that which He has guaranteed for
them. They do not care for that which He has ordered them to
do. They rejoice at worldly pleasures and feel sorry when they
miss their share in it, but they do not feel sorry when they miss
Paradise and what it contains.

They do not rejoice at faith the way they rejoice at the Dirham
and the Dinar. They ruin their reward with their sins, their
guidance with perversity and their good with evil. They mix their
faith with uncertainty, and their lawful deeds with the unlawtul.
They hesitate in the confusion of their ideas and thoughts. They
neglect Allah’s guidance, which He guided them to. And what
is more, the enemy uses the owner of the stronghold to ruin his
own stronghold with his own hands.

Chapter: The Bases of Infidelity

There are four bases of infidelity: They are pride, envy, anger,
and desire.

Pride can be prevented through submission to Allah, envy
through advice and offering it, anger through justice, and desire
through devoting oneself to worship. If the base of pride falls,
submission would be easy for him, if the base of envy falls,
accepting advice and offering it would be easy, if the base of
anger falls, justice and humility would be easy, and if the base
of desire falls, patience, virtue, and worship would be easy for
him. Removing mountains from their places would be easier
than removing these four from whoever was afflicted with them,

266 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

especially if they have become solid bases, habits, and firm
characteristics. No deed will be worthy and no soul will be pure
as long as these four are found in the servant. The more hard
he works, the more these four will spoil his deeds. All evil
results from them. If they grow in the heart, they will change
right to wrong and wrong to right and truth will be considered
falsehood and falsehood will be considered truth. This worldly
life will be close to him and the Hereafter will be far. If ‏ناملا‎ think
carefully about the disbelief of a nation, you will find that it
resulted from these four, and their punishment will be according
to their intensity. Whoever surrenders to these four would be
Opening the doors of all sooner and later evils, and whoever
avoids them, would be closing the doors of all evils, as they
prevent submission, devotion, repentance, accepting right and
advice of Muslims, and being modest to Allah and His
creatures.

The origin of these four is being ignorant of Allah and of himself.
If he knew his Lord, the attributes of His perfection and the
qualities of His majesty and knew himself, and his defects and
faults, he would never be proud, or angry, and would never
envy anyone about what Allah granted him. Envy in reality is a
way of showing enmity toward Allah; he hates the blessings of
Allah to be granted to another servant while Allan loves it, and
such a person likes it to vanish while Allah hates that. He is
against Allah in His judgments, destiny, love, and hate. That is
why Satan is in reality his enemy; as his sin resulted from pride
and envy. Removing these two is done through knowing Allah,
acknowledging Him, being satisfied with Him, repenting to Him,
removing all anger from his soul and knowing that it is not
worthy to be angry and seek revenge. If you do so, you will
prefer it more than its creator and the most important thing to
remove such a disease is to make it accustomed to be angry
and satisfied because of Allah and for Him. Whenever it feels

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠» 7

something of anger or satisfaction when seeking Allah, in
exchange it will lose something from anger and satisfaction.

The cure of desire is true knowledge and learning that giving
the soul all it desires is the greatest cause behind depriving it
from these desires, while protecting it from them is the best way
to gain them. The more you close the door to desires, the
more you would be reaching the desires in the most perfect
way.

Anger is like a lion; if its owner sets it free, it will eat him. Desire
is like a fire; if its owner starts it, it will burn him. Pride is like
fighting against a king to take his Kingdom, if it does not destroy
you It will expel you, and envy is like showing enmity to one
who is more powerful than you. Whoever overcomes his desire
and anger, Satan will depart from him and whoever’s desire
and anger beat him, Satan will stick to him.

A Most Precious Gem Characteristics of those
who do not Know Allah

Those who do not know Allah, His names, or His attributes and
those who deny their reality are making Allah hateful to His
creatures and closing the way for them to love and get close to
Him by obeying Him. We will mention some examples:

Such people persuade weak souls by saying that obedience
will not bring them the pleasure of Allah, the Exalted even if it
was sincerely done and the servant, who exaggerates in
obeying Allah both in secret and public, there is no trust or
_ guarantee that the servant is safe from harm, and that Allah
used to take His pious servant from the concave to the brothel,
_ from monotheism to polytheism and playing music, and turns
the heart from faith to disbelief. They quote evidence to prove
their claims but they do not understand these proofs. They

_ Claim that this is the reality of monotheism and they recite the

verses of Allah in which He says,
268 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

which means, "He cannot be questioned as to what He does."
(Al-Anbiya', 21:23)

And He, the Almighty says,

people who are the losers." (Al-A’raf, 7:99)

And He, the Almighty says,

which means, "And know that Allah comes in between a person
and his heart (i.e. He prevents an evil person to decide
anything).” (Al-Anfal, 8:24)

They claim that Satan is the source of their knowledge and that
it used to be the head by Angels and that every place in both
the heavens and the earth had the favor that Satan had bowed
in it but destiny was unjust toward it and Allah turned its good
eye into the most evil one. They reached the degree that some
of their masters said, "You should be afraid of Allah exactly as
you are afraid of a lion to jump on you without committing any
sin." As proof they recite a hadith of the Prophet (peace be
upon him). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “A man
amongst you may do (good deeds _ until there is only a cubit
between him and Paradise and then what has been written for
him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 9

characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire."°* And they
mentioned that some of the predecessors said, "The most
grievous of the great sins is to feel secure against the plan of
Allah and to despair of the mercy of Allah."

Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that 'Un bin ‘Abdullah® or
another heard a man_ invoking Allah and saying, "0 Allah! Do
not let me feel secure of Your plan." So he blamed him and
said, "Say, 'O Allah! Do not make me among those who feel
secure of Your plan." And they based that on their incorrect
beliefs, which deny wisdom, justification, and reason and that
all the deeds of Allah are not according to any wisdom or
cause; He does according to His wish, which is far away from
wisdom, justification, and reason. He does not behave for a
reason; it is simply lawful for Him to fiercely punish His pious
people and generously reward His enemies and the people of
sin, aS both cases are equal to Him. The impossibility of this
matter will become known only by reporting from Allah, the
Truthful that He will never do that. Injustice will never come
from Allah. It is like making one body into two places at the
same time, gathering night and day in one hour, and making a
thing visible and invisible at the same time. This is the reality of
injustice according to them. If a scholar thinks about it himself,
he would find that if we are not secure of His plan, how can we
trust Him? How can we depend on obeying and following His
orders while we just have this small period of time in front of us
to live? If we abandon pleasures, neglect desires, and bear
heavy acts of worship while we know that we can not trust Him:
He can change our faith into disbelief, monotheism into

polytheism, obedience into disobedience, and piety into impiety,
and can punish us forever, and then we will be loosing both this
worldly life and the Hereafter.

If such belief increases in their hearts and souls, after that
whenever they are ordered to perform acts of worship and
negiect desires, they will be like the one who says to his son: if
you write, your teacher becomes better, behave yourself and do
not disobey him, he may punish you, and if you become lazy,
neglectful and disobedient, he may honor you and make you
close to him. The father strengthened this belief in his son's
heart saying that he cannot trust or believe in neither any threat
of any teacher for his wrongdoing nor believe in the promise of
good for his good deeds. And when the boy grew up and
became more qualified to handle business and position, his
father said to him: this is the sultan of our country, who takes a
thief from prison and makes him the minister and the Emir and
takes the pious man from his job and puts him in prison forever,
or kills or crucifies him. When the father said so, he made him
hate the sultan and never trust him for any threat or promise.
He removed any love for this sultan from his son's heart and
replaced it with fear. Fear from an unjust person, who
punishes the innocent. This miserable son lost the belief that
deeds are either useful or harmful. He neither feels happiness
when doing good deeds nor feels bad when doing evil deeds.
This is what such people are doing to other humble people who
listen to them and believe their words. Whoever wants to make
people hate religion and Allah, he can simply say the same |
thing.

Those who call to this method believe that he is propagating .
monotheism, destiny, refuting the people of innovations, and ~
supporting religion. By Allah, a wise enemy is better than an _
ignorant friend. Allah wrote all reality and His Messengers are ©
all witnesses, especially the Qur'an. If those who call for justice |
follow the method that Allah and His Messenger used in calling —

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings *» 1

people, the world would be a better place. Allah, the Exalted
revealed His words and He is the Truthful and the Faithful that
He is treating people according to their deeds and rewarding
them according to their actions. The good servant never fears
any injustice; his good deeds will never be wasted. The servant
never loses even a whit of his good deeds. Allah says,

wy

‎an 73 7 7 ane 2‏ ,24 5* وو دع 7. 2 نز

‎which means, "But if there is any good (done), He doubles it,
and gives from Him a great reward." (An-Nisa’, 4:40)

‎Allah also punishes those who commit sin without doubling or
erasing it through repentance, regret, and asking for
forgiveness, while good deed are doubled ten times until seven
hundred times.

‎He, the Almighty reforms evil servants, accepts the hearts of
those who are disobedient, forgives sinners, guides people
who are astray, rescues those who are spoiled, teaches the
ignorant, leads those who are confused, reminds those who
forget, and shelters fugitives. But He punishes those who
increase in disobedience and violate His limits, after calling
them several times to repent, ask forgiveness, and
acknowledge His Divinity. After loosing all hope in their
response, acknowiedging His Divinity, and His oneness, Allah
punishes them for some of their disbelief, tyranny, and
rebellion. If the servant thinks about his condition, he would
feel guilty, and admit that Allah was not unjust toward him and
that he was simply unjust to himself. Allah says about the
people of the Hellfire,

‏مد ‎eae‏ 06> 5 يي #2 ‎ok © a‏ وري

‎which means, "Then they will confess their sin. So, away with
the dwellers of the blazing Fire." (Al-Mulk, 67:11)

272 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

And He, the Almighty says about those whom He ruined in this
worldly life that they said when they saw His punishment,

0 م 7 رهم مس 3 ‎ro‏ 5 َه 2-2 07 بم 0 5 ‎we oi.‏ ملعا دي - ‎e‏

which means, “They cried: "Woe to us! Certainly! We have been
Zhalimun (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in the
Oneness of Allah, etc.). And that cry of theirs ceased not, till We
made them as a field that is reaped, extinct (dead)." (Al-Anbiya’,
21:14-15)

And He, the Almighty says that the owners of the garden, which
He burnt when they saw it said,

_ “ ‏له‎ # ee ae

which means, “They said: "Glory to Our Lord! Verily, we have
been Zhalimun (wrong-doers, etc.)." (Al-Qalam, 68:29)

Al-Hasan said, "The people of the Hellfire entered Hell while
praising Allah in their hearts and could not prevent that. That is
why Allah says,

مع رار ‎Ge 20g‏ ار عدو © رصح و و م رد لم
‎Qala ji aid »‏ ظَلَمُوأ ‎ids‏ رَبْ الْعَلِينَ 2 4

which means, "So the roots of the people who did wrong were
cut off. And all the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of
the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn, and all that exists)." (Al-An'am, 6:45)

That is to say, Allah cut off their roots and He is to be praised
for doing so according to His wisdom and justice and giving the
suitable punishment in its due time. That is why He said in
another verse when He sets His judgments of His servants; the
people of good to Paradise and people of evil to Hellfire,

truth, and it will be said. All the praises and thanks be to Allah,
the Lord of the ‘Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)." (Az-
Zumar, 39:75)

He did not mention those who praise Allah, He left it general; as
if the whole universe thanks Him when they see His wisdom,
justice, and favor. That is why He says on behalf of the people
of the Hellfire,

gee Eo th sew
4 ‏جهنم ...يج‎ GF! ‏قيل اذخلوا‎ «

which means, "It will be said (to them): "Enter you the gates of
Hell." (Az-Zumar, 39:72)

|) is as if the whole universe is saying so even their bodies,
and souls, and the heavens and the earth. He, the Exalted tells
us that as He is going to destroy His enemies, He is going to
save His pious people, and He is not going to destroy them
according to His mere wish.

When Noth (Noah, peace be upon him) asked Him to save his
son, Allah tells us that He will drown him because of his evil
deeds and disbelief and did not say: | drowned him according to
My wish and will without a reason or a sin. And Allah
guarantees to increase those who fight in His cause in guidance
and did not say that He will destroy their efforts and mislead
them.

And He also guarantees to increase in guidance those who
are pious and seek His pleasure. He tells them that He only .
misleads those who violate their oaths with Him and He only
misleads those who prefer evil more than guidance. In that
case, He will then seal up their hearts and ears. He changes
the heart of whoever does not accept His guidance when it

274 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

comes, does not believe in it, and neglects it, so He changes
his heart and eyes as a punishment for him for what he did. And
if Allah knew, in any of theses cases, that there is a chance of
guidance, He would guide and lead them but they do not
deserve His blessings and do not deserve His dignity. Allah,
the Exalted removed causes, showed proofs, and enabled all
the means of guidance. He only misleads dissolute and unjust
servants, seals up the hearts of the aggressors, and throws into
seduction after removing all the causes and showing all the
proofs. He explains the means of guidance and that He only
misleads the hypocrites because of their deeds. The covering
that covers the hearts of the disbelievers is the result of their
own deeds. Allah says,

95 deo
7 7. “ ¢ ws 12 442 ‏سبي‎ oe
CD OLSIBEC posh ‏رَانَ عَلَ‎ We E>

which means, “Nay! But on their hearts is the Ran (covering of
sins and evil deeds) which they used to earn." (Al-Mutafifin, 83:
14)

And He, the Almighty says about His enemies from among the
Jews,

yg ee ta ee a Bk et Be ‏كم‎

which means, "And of their saying: "Our hearts are wrapped
(with coverings, i.e. we do not understand what the Messengers
say)" - nay, Allah has set a seal upon their hearts because of
their disbelief." (An-Nisa', 4:155)

Allah tells us that He does not mislead whoever was guided
until He shows him the paths and enables him to choose, and
he chooses because of his unhappiness and bad nature, and
he goes astray because he does not heed guidance, he is evil
and he himself and his Satan are an enemy of Allah.

The Plan of Allah, the Exalted:

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings «٠ 275

The plan, which Allah described is through punishing those who
planned against His pious people and His Messengers. He
faces their evil plan with His good plan. Thus their plots are the
ugliest but the plan of Allah is the best as itis just. His plan is a
punishment from Him for their deception against His
Messengers and people, and there is nothing better than this
deception and plan of Allah against the disbelievers.

Concerning the saying, "A man amongst you may do (good
deeds) until there is only a cubit between him and Paradise
and then what has been written for him decides his behavior
and he starts doing the (evil) deeds characteristic of the people
of the (Hell) Fire..." this is a good deed of the people of
Paradise as it is shown to others; if it was a good and accepted
deed that deserves Paradise that Allah loved and agreed with,
He would never lose his good deed. " Until there is only a cubit
between him and Paradise" can also suit this interpretation;
deeds are calculated according to their results and their ends.
This servant was not patient in order to complete his deed until
its end and then obtain its reward. It contained a hidden vice
that caused its ruin in its final stages. This vice and hidden evil
betrayed him in the time of need. If there was no deception or
vice, Allah would never turn his faith. The servant performs this
deed with complete truth and sincerity without any reason that
requires spoiling it, and Allah knows the secrets of His servants
that are not known to each other.

Concerning Satan, Allah, the Exalted says to His Angels,
which means, "I know that which you do not know." (Al-
Bagarah, 2:30)

_ Allah knew the disbelief, pride and envy that was in Satan's
. heart, which the Angels did not know. When they were ordered
to bow, the contents of their hearts were revealed: obedience,

276 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

love, piety, and yielding and they proceeded to obey. And the
contents of the enemy's heart were revealed: pride, deception,
and envy as it refused and was among the disbelievers.

The pious people fear His plan. They fear that Allah may let
them down because of their sins and that their fate will be
unhappy. They fear their sins, and hope for His mercy.

And when Allah, the Almighty says,
4> 2... bile ‏أفأمئوأ‎ «

which means, "Did they then feel secure against the Plan of
Allah?" (Al-A'raf, 7:99)

It is referring to the disbelievers and the wicked. The verse
means that those who disobey and feel secure against the plan
of Allah when facing their evil plots are the losers and those
who fear Him are those who know Him and fear His plan; He
may delay His punishment until they get used to their sins and
then the punishment would come suddenly.

Or they may forget Him and His remembrance, so He will
abandon them 35 they abandon His remembrance and
obedience and then they will be afflicted with distress and
seduction. His plan here would be to abandon them. Also He
knows about their sins and defects what they do not know
about themselves, so the plan of Allah would come to them
without their knowing.

Allah examines and afflicts them with what they cannot bear
and they will be seduced and this is the plan of Allah.

Chapter: The Tree of Sincerity

A year is like a tree, the months are its boughs, the days are its
branches, the hours are its leaves, and its breath ‏15ل‎ its fruit.
Whoevers breath used to obey Allah, the fruit of his tree will

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 277

be good and pure. Whoever’s breath used to disobey Allah, his
fruit will be evil. The time of harvest is on the Day of
Resurrection and at that time the fruit will be shown, whether it
is sweet or sour.

Sincerity and monotheism is a tree within the heart. Its
branches are deeds and its fruit is the pleasures of life during
this worldly life and permanent happiness in the Hereafter. The
fruit of Paradise is neither limited nor forbidden, and the fruit of
monotheism and sincerity in this worldly life are the same.

Polytheism, lying, and hypocrisy are also a tree within the
heart. Its fruit is during life like fear, distress, sadness, and
tightness of the chest and darkness of the heart, and in the
Hereafter Az-Zaqqum and a permanent punishment. Allah
mentioned those two trees in verses of (chapter Ibrahim, 14)

Chapter: Degrees of Happiness

When the servant attains the age of puberty, he is to be given
his oath, which Allah, His Creator and Owner entrusted to him.
If he strongly handles his oath, accepts, and is determined to
fulfill it, he deserves to be granted degrees and ranks, which
are given to those who fulfill their oaths. If his soul has some
doubts, and he supports it and sticks to his oath and says: | am
qualified to fulfill the oath of my Lord, who is more qualified to
accept, understand, or fulfill it than me? He first adheres to
understanding his oath, thinking about it, and knowing the
advice of his Lord to him, and then he adjusts his soul to obey
this oath, work according to it, and fulfill it. He sees the reality of
this oath and what it contains through his heart. He created an
intention and a determination other than the one that was in his
time of youth before he took this oath. He left behind the
carelessness of youth and followed habits and nature, endured
the honor of this intention, and tore the veil of darkness to the
light of belief. Through his patience and sincere effort, he knew
the favors that Allah has granted him.

278 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

The first among the degrees of his happiness is to have a keen
ear and heart that understands what the ear would hear, if he
hears, realizes, sees the good path, sees that the majority of
people are going astray, keeps to it and does not go astray. The
reason behind going astray is refusing the oath, accepting it
unwillingly, accept it while lacking power and determination, or
failing to urge themselves to understand it, think about it, work
according to it, or fulfill it. The oath was offered to them while
still in their youth and observing religion as a habit and
according to what they used to see their parents doing. They
received the oath while feeling satisfied with what they saw
from their parents and ancestors. This is not enough for
whoever aims his intention and heart at understanding the oath
and working according to it as if this oath applied to him alone
and it was said to him: think about what this oath contains and
work according to it. If he did not receive his oath in this way, he
would follow his ancestors, the habits of his family, friends,
neighbors, and the people of his country. He would be satisfied
to take religion as a habit. If Satan seduces him and reaches
his intention and determination, it would accuse him of clanship
and zealotry to his fathers and ancestors and convince him that
this 15 right and whatever disagrees with it is false; guidance
would be considered evil and evil would be considered
guidance. This would indeed be fanaticism, which is not based
on knowledge. As he is satisfied to follow his family and nation,
he will have what they have and will also have to pay what
they are paying. He is far removed from guidance and Allah
abandons him to whoever he took as a friend. He will see any .
guidance that disagrees with his nation and family as evil and
false. If he has a higher intention, a more honorable soul, anda -

higher worth, he would proceed to fulfill his oath and ©
understand it and would know that the owner of this oath has a 5

great stature that other people do not have. Through this oath -

he would know Allah. Allah will know that he Knows Him, His ~

attributes, names, doings, and judgments. The servant will

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠» 279

know that Allah is self-existing, enables others to exist, is in no
need of anyone while all others are in need of Him. That He
established Himself on the Throne above all His creatures, that
He sees, hears, accepts, becomes angry, loves, hates,
manages the affairs of His kingdom, orders, and forbids,
sends His Messengers to every place in His kingdom bearing
His words, which are heard by whoever wishes from among His
creatures. He stands firm on justice, awards according to both
good and bad, is the Most Forbearing, the Most Merciful, the
All-Thankful, the Most Generous, and the Well-doer. He is
described with all perfection and is far above all defects, and
He has no equal. The servant can see the wisdom of Allah in
managing His kingdom and how He foreordains matters
according to His will without opposing justice and wisdom. And
when there is a confrontation between the mind, law, and
nature, each one of them proved the truth in and of itself. The
servant understands what Allah has described Himself with in
His Book from the reality of His names that were revealed in His
Book. The names with which Allah was introduced to His
servants remain until the minds acknowledge Him and indeed
nature testifies to Him.

If the servant knew and believed in his heart in the attributes of
the owner of the oath, the light of these attributes would rise
within his heart and would be as if he saw them. with his own
eyes. He would see their connection with creation and the
commands of Allah, their effects in the sensual and spiritual
world, and their effect on creatures; how they prevail, favor,
come near, banish, give, and prevent. He would see with his
heart the examples of His justice, favor, and mercy. Allah
deserves to be worshiped according to irrefutable proof, valid
judgments, perfect power, complete justice and wisdom,
superiority above all His creatures as well as the fact that He is
thorough, simultaneous, great, lofty, glorious, violent, and
revengeful and with His mercy, He is charitable, kind,
generous, forgiving, and patient. The servant would see the

280 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

irrefutable proof with valid judgments that any creature could
not rebel against, and how these attributes agree with and are
in harmony and prove each other. He would discover that
wisdom prevails, which is the aim and end of all judgments,
which are the beginning of all things, and how their divisions
come back to the origins and principles of aims as if he is
watching the principles of wisdom in action. He would notice
how cases are based according to wisdom, justice, benefit,
mercy, and charity. There is no case that deviates from that
until the end of the world and all that exists and people are
judged on the Day of Resurrection, which will show His justice,
and wisdom, and the truth of His Messengers and what they
said about Allah to mankind; including humans and jinn both
believers and disbelievers. And then it would be revealed to His
creatures from His attributes that which they did not know
before that. Even those who knew Him best during this life
would praise Him because of the perfection of His attributes
and honored descriptions, which he did not know during this
life. This would be shown to His creatures and the reasons
would be also shown to them according to which people
deviated, went astray, and became negligent. The difference
between knowing the reality of His names and attributes and
knowing them during this worldly life will be like the difference
between Paradise and Hellfire and seeing them, and even
greater than that.

It would be also understood from the oath how His names and
attributes require the existence of prophethood, decrees, and
not to leave His creatures live in vain, as well as requiring what
is included in the forms of commands and prohibitions, and
what is required in the existence of reward, punishment, and
resurrection. This is necessary because of His s names and
attributes as to be deemed far above all that His enemies
claim. The servant would see in the oath the generality of
power and its effect on all creatures, which did not even miss

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 28]

one whit and that if Allah has any other gods alongside Him,
the world would be destroyed, including the heavens, the earth,
and all that is between them. He will see how Islam and the
faith, which all creatures have comes from these Divine
attributes, and how they require reward and punishment sooner
or later. He will understand that it is impossible to combine
acceptance of this oath and denying His attributes, His
Superiority above His creatures, communicating with man
through His Books, and oaths. It also includes those who
refuse to take this oath and fulfill it and even whoever
accepted it but did not accept it as a whole.

Chapter: The Body and Soul

The body of the son of Adam was created from the earth and
his soul from the government of Heaven and then they were
joined. If he is hungry, stays awake, and keeps his body busy in
serving Allah, his soul will find itself lighter and more peaceful
50 that it would long for the place from which it was created and
miss its heavenly world. But if he secures food, blessings,
sleep, and rest, the body will incline to remain at the place from
which it was created and the soul would be pulled along with it
and be in a prison. If it was not for the fact that it would get used
to that prison, it would ask for help, as a tortured person does,
to find relief from the pain resulting from the separation and
departure from its own world from which it was created.

In general, the more the body is light, the more the soul will be
light and seek its heavenly world, and the more the body is
heavy and seeks desires and relief, the heavier the soul will be
and it will come down from its heavenly world and become
lower and more earthly. You may see the soul of a man in
Heaven while his body is on the earth. Another person serves
Allah with his body and his soul is low and wandering about in
lowly matters. When the soul separates from the body, it would
either catch up with its high or low place. With the nigh, it would

282 ٠ Al-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

find every blessing, happiness, beauty, pleasure, and good
living while with the low it would find every distress, grief,
suffering, sadness, and bad and difficult thing. Allah says,

رمه كوم را د الى ه ‎wer‏ 7 ري ل لك

9 ومن اعرض عن ‎Sd‏ فإن لهد معيشة ‎Ree‏ ...220 4

which means, "But whosoever turns away from My Reminder

(i.e. neither believes in this Qur'an nor acts on its orders, etc.)
verily, for him is a life of hardship." (Taha, 20:124)

"My Reminder" is His words, which He revealed to His
Messenger, and "turns away" is by neglecting and abandoning
working according to these words, and the majority of
explanations saw that "life of hardship" is torture in the grave.
lbn Mas'dd, Abu Hurairah, Abu 5310 Al-Khudry, and lbn ‘Abbas
agreed on that and it has a traceable hadith.

This life of hardship is in return for relieving the body and soul
with pleasures, desires and relief. The more you enrich the
soul, it will restrain the heart until you live a life of hardship,
and the more you restrain the soul, it will enrich the heart until
that heart will be delighted and relieved. Hardship in this worldly
life, following piety will find its relief in partition and the
Hereafter, and relief in this worldly life following desires will find
its hardship in the partition and the Hereafter. You should
choose one of the two: the better, more pleasant, and more
lasting. You may distress the body in order to relieve the soul
but do not distress the soul to relieve the body; relief and
distress of the soul is greater and more lasting while relief and
distress of the body is shorter and easier.

Leaving Sins First

A wise man will never order people to abandon life; as they
cannot leave it, but he may order them to leave sins. Leaving
lite is a favor for them while leaving sins is an obligatory act of
worship. How can they be ordered to do a favor while they do

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 3

not fulfill the obligation? If it was hard for you to leave sins,
exert your effort to make them love Allah through mentioning
His blessings, favors, benefits, and attributes of perfection. The
hearts are naturally disposed to love Allah, and if they were
deeply attached to Him, leaving sins would be easy. Yahya bin
Mu'adh said: the wise person when seeking this worldly life is
better than the ignorant one who leaves it.

The wise man calls people to Allah while they are still enjoying
their worldly life and the answer would be easy but the pious
person calls them to Allah through leaving this worldly life.
Weaning human beings is hard when they are used to being
fed from this breast (this worldly life), but we should choose the
better and greater suckling mother: as milk influences the
nature of man. The milk of a bad mother results in a bad child.
The best kind of suckling is what is had after starvation. If you
have the power to bear the pains of weaning, get a reasonable
amount, as some kinds of indigestion cause death.

It is not astonishing to see someone in good health, free and

someone who is weak, unhealthy, has many irons in the fire,
does not have a stable condition and at the same time
observes his: religious duties, without failing to perform
anything he is supposed to do.

Chapter: Knowing Allah
Knowing Allah, Exalted be He, is of two kinds:

One: awareness of confession, which includes all people: the
righteous and the wicked, the obedient and the disobedient.

Two: awareness that necessitates being shy of Him, showing
love to Him, being aware of Him in the heart, yearning to meet
Him, fearing Him, turning to Him and repenting to Him, being at
ease with everything concerning Him and fleeing from creation
to Him.

This is the special awareness that is on the lips of all people.
Their various levels can only be counted by the One Who
informed them about Himself and made them aware of some of
His knowledge that He concealed from others, and each one of
them indicated this awareness according to his status and that
which had been disclosed to him.

The most knowledgeable in creation about Him said, “! do not
count any praise for You, You are as You have praised
Yourself.” ** He also said that on the Day of Resurrection, Allah,
the Almighty would reveal to him some words of praise that he
is not able to pronounce now.

Concerning this awareness, there are two large sections:

Section one: thinking and meditation on all the Quranic
Verses, and the special understanding about Allah and His
Messenger (peace be upon him).

54 Recorded by Muslim, Kitab As-Salah, Bab, that which is said while in the
state of bowing down and prostration, no. (486).

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 5

Section two: thinking about His Visual Signs, and meditating
on His Wisdom in them, His Strength, His Courtesy, His
Kindness, His Justice, His Fairness and always maintaining His
creation with justice. In a few words: to be knowledgeable ‏أن‎
‎the meaning of His Beautiful Names, their Majesty, their
Perfection, His Uniqueness, and their connection with the
creation and the orders of Allah. He would then be an expert
concerning His Commandments and Prohibitions, an expert
concerning His Fate and Destiny, an expert concerning His
Beautiful Names and Attributes, an expert concerning religious
judgments and the judgment of this worldly life, and that is just
as it is in the Qur’anic verse,

‎a7 7 7 - 6‏ 2 - رسع ‎ire = oe 4 SG‏
« ...ذلك فَضْلّ اله يُؤْتِيهِ من يَسَاءُ ‎ily‏ ذو الْفضل الْعظيم ‎4B)‏

‎which means, “That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on
whom He pleases. And Allah is the Owner of Great Bounty.”
(Al-Hadid, 57:21)

‎Chapter: Licit and Illicit Gains
There are four ways of gaining wealth:

‎Wealth gained by obeying Allah and spent in the way of Allah,
and that is the best wealth.

‎Wealth gained by disobeying Allah and spent in disobeying
Allah, and that is the worst.

‎Wealth gained by doing harm to a Muslim, and spent in doing
harm to a Muslim, that is also the worst.

‎Wealth gained licitly, and spent on lawful desires, and that is
neither for him nor against him.

‎These are the principle ways of gaining wealth and spending
them.

‎There are some other ways that branch out from them:

286 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Wealth gained rightly, and spent illicitly.

Wealth gained illicitly, and spent rightly. Therefore, spending it
is its expiation.

Wealth gained in a doubtful way, and its expiation is to spend
it on dutifulness to Allah.

And just as reward, punishment, praise and dispraise are
connected to spending wealth, in the same way, they are
connected to gaining it. Moreover, a man will be asked about
his expenditure, where he gained it, and on what he spent it.

Chapter: Consolation of the Believers
There are different ways of consoling the believers:
Consolation with wealth.
Consolation with high rank.
Consolation with body and service.
Consolation with advice and instruction.
Consolation with supplication and seeking forgiveness for them.
Consolation by sympathizing with them.

These forms of consolation are according to the faith of the
servant. Whenever the faith is weak, the consolation would also.
be weak. But whenever the faith is firm, the consolation would
also be so. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was
the person who consoled his Companions (may Allah be
pleased with them) the most, and his followers’ consolation is
according to the degree in which they follow him.

Some people once visited Bishr Al-Hafi on a very cold day. He
had no clothes on and was shaking. They said, “O Abu Nasr,
what is this?, he said, "| remembered the poor people and the
cold weather they are suffering from, and as | have nothing to

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 7

console them, | decided to sympathize with them in their cold
weather.”

Chapter: Unawareness Causes Hardship

Being unaware of the way leading to Allah, its difficulty and
purpose causes many problems and has little benefit, because
the person may exert great effort in performing Supererogatory
duties, while neglecting a religious obligation. He may
preoccupy himself with a deed connected with the body, while
having something else in the heart, or a deed of the heart,
without any action from the body. He may have great
determination concerning a deed, without observing its
purpose. He may perform a deed without being cautious of its
evil consequences, while performing the deed and _ after
performing it.

He may undertake a deed without acknowledging Allah’s
Kindness in it, by feeling that he participated in the fulfillment of
the deed, and not by the Grace of Allah. It may be a deed
where he failed to observe his heedlessness in it, and excuse
for it. It may be a deed where he did not give its due in full like
advice and kindness, while thinking that he gave it its due. Al
these decrease the fruit of the deed, in addition to a Jot of
trouble. It is Only Allah Who grants success.

Chapter: The Journey to Allah, Exalted be He, and
its Obstacles

When the servant is determined to follow the way that leads to
Allah, Exalted be He, he would be confronted with tricks and
hindrances. Initially, he may be deceived by lusts, sovereignty,
pleasures, spouses and clothes, and if he yields to them, he
would give up, and if he rejects them and does not yield to them
and was sincere in his cause, he would be tried with his
children, by receiving more importance among people, by
people supplicating for him, by people seeking blessing from

288 © AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

him, and so on. If he yields to them, he would not be able to
continue on the way to Allah, and that would be his share. And
if he is able to reject them, and does not yield to them, he would
be tried by miracles and discoveries.

If he yields to them, he would cease to continue on his journey
to Allah, and that would be his share. If he does not yield, he
would be tried by renunciation, the pleasure of being with Allah,
the honor of solitude and giving up worldly pleasures. If he
yields to that, he would be quitting the purpose.

And if he does not yield to that, he will continue, keeping an
eye on his duty to Allah, and that which pleases Him, in order
to be His true servant, no matter how or when. Whether this
situation was the cause of his difficulty or rest; whether he
enjoyed it or suffered from it, and whether it made him be with
people or isolated him from them.

He does not choose for himself, except that which his Lord and
Master chooses for him. He must approve of His Order and
fulfill it according to his ability. His own self is less important to
himself than placing its rest and pleasure over the pleasure of
His Master and His Order. This would be the servant who would
have reached the end of the journey, and was able to fulfill His
orders and nothing was able to prevent him from his Master.
And it is only through Allah that real success is achieved.

Chapter: Kinds of Grace
There are three kinds of grace:
Grace that is present, and the servant is aware of it.
Grace that is expected and hoped for.
Grace the servant is enjoying but does not feel it.

If it pleases Allah to perfect His Grace upon His Servant, He
would make him aware of His Present Grace, and grant him

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 9

the ability to be grateful as a preservation of this grace, for it
disappears with disobedience; but with gratitude, it remains. He
would also make it easy for him to perform deeds that would
bring forth the expected grace, and make him see the causes
that ruin this grace, and help him to stay away from them. In no
time, it would come to him in abundance. And then, He would
make him aware of the grace he is enjoying but not feeling.

It is reported that a Bedouin once visited Hardin Ar-Rashid and
said, “O Commander of the believers, may Allah preserve for
you the grace that you are enjoying, by making it easy for you
to keep being grateful, and may He fulfill for you the grace you
hope for, by making it easy for you to do the things He likes
and continue to obey Him, and make you aware of the grace
you are enjoying but you are not aware of, so that you become
grateful to Him.” He was pleased with these words and said,
“How great are his words!”

A Great Principle: The Beginning of Knowledge
and Action

The beginning of every theoretical capacity of awareness, anda
practical capacity, is ideas and thoughts. They cause
imagination, and imagination leads to will, and will necessitates
action, and repeating that many times produces a_ habit,
therefore, the correctness of these steps is according to the
correctness of the ideas and thoughts, and their corruption is
according to their corruption.

The correctness of ideas is when the person observes his
Owner and Lord, yearns for Him and focuses on Him, for He is
the cause of all that is correct. He is the One Who grants right
guidance. His protection includes all kinds of protection for His
servant and turning away from Him is the cause of all perversity
and misfortune.

290 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

The servant gains all sorts of good and right guidance
according to the degree of his awareness of His Grace, His
Oneness, ways of Knowing Him, ways of submitting to Him,
considering Him to be present with him, watching him, looking
at him, observing him, and looking into his thoughts, will and
intention. By then he would be shy of Him, and glorify Him so
highly to the extent that he would not allow himself to be seen
by Him doing things he does want people to see him doing.

When he considers his Lord as exaltedly as this, approaches
Him, honors Him, selects and supports Him, according to that,
Allah, the Almighty would keep baseness and bad thoughts
away from him. And whenever he keeps away from Him and
turns his back on Him, He would approach these base_ things
and bad thoughts. By then He would prevent all perfection from
him, and he would be exposed to all sorts of defects.

Therefore, man is the best of creatures when he approaches
his Creator and abides by His Commands and abandons what
He has forbidden, performs deeds according to His Pleasure
and prefers Him to his vain desires. And he would be the worst
of creatures when he moves away from Him, and refuses to
come near Him to obey Him and seek His Pleasure.

Therefore, when he chooses to be near Him and prefers Him
over his vain desires, then he would have applied his heart and
mind and faith upon himself and his Satan; he would have
applied his reason upon his temptation, and his guidance upon
his vain desire. But when he chooses to be away from Him,
then he would have applied his own self, his vain desire and
Satan upon his mind, heart and senses.

Ideas and Scruples

You should know that ideas and scruples lead to thoughts, and
thoughts lead to remembrance, and remembrance leads to_ will,
and will leads to action, then it becomes firm and finally it
becomes a habit. It would be easier to put a stop to it from the

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠ 1

beginning than to terminate it when it has become strong and
compiete.

It is well known that man has not been given the ability to
terminate ideas, for they fall upon him just like breath, except
that the power of faith and mind help him adopt the best of
them, be pleased with them and feel at ease with them. It also
helps him push away the worst of them and hate them, as some
of the Companions said, “O Messenger of Allah! Verily we
perceive in our minds that which every one of us considers too
grave to express.’ He (peace be upon him) said, ‘Do you really
perceive it?’ They said, ‘Yes.’ Upon this he remarked, ‘That is
pure faith.” 85

And in another wording the Messenger (peace be upon him)
said, “All praise and thanks be to Allah, Who turned his cunning
with scruple.”

There are two points of views concerning this statement:
One: rejecting and hating itis pure faith.

Two: its existence and throwing it into the heart by Satan is
pure faith, because he threw it into the heart in order to be in
conflict with faith and eliminate it.

Certainly, Allah, the Almighty has created the mind just like a
mill, which does not stop and has to have something to grind. If
grain is put into it, it would grind it, and if soil is put into it or
pebbles, it would also grind them. Therefore, thoughts and
ideas that occur in the mind are like the grain that is put in the
mill, and the mill can never remain without working.

Therefore, there are some people whose mill grinds grain to
produce flour in order to benefit themselves and other people,
but the bulk of them grind sand, pebbles, straw etc. When it is

time for kneading and baking, the reality becomes apparent to
him.

Chapter: The Heart is Never Void of Thoughts

When you reject an idea that comes to you, that which is after
it would be rejected. But when you accept it, it would be a
wandering thought, then it would prey upon the will, and with
the help of the thought, they would use the body. If it is difficult
to be used, they would both turn to the heart with hope and lust,
and you would direct it to what is desired.

|] is a well Known fact that reforming ideas is easier than
reforming thoughts. and reforming thoughts is easier than
reforming will, and reforming will is easier than amending the
evil of a deed, and amending it is easier than putting an end to
habits.

The best medicine therefore, is to preoccupy yourself with
things that concern you, away from that which does not concern
you, because thinking about things that do not concern you is
the beginning of all evil things. Whoever thinks about that which
does not concern him, would miss that which concerns him, and
he would be preoccupied with something that contains no good,
far away from the best thing for him.

Therefore, thoughts, ideas, will and intention are the best things
you should reform in yourself, because they are your
characteristics and your reality, with which you can be closer to
01 away from your Lord, without whose nearness and Pleasure,
you would never find happiness. And all misfortunes are
because of your being away from Him and His displeasure
with you. Whoever is low and despicable in his ideas and the
domain of his thoughts, would be the same in the rest of his
concerns.

Be careful not to make it possible for Satan to control your
thoughts and will, for he would ruin them for you to the extent

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ® 293

that it would be very difficult for you to make them right. He
would throw upon you all kinds of harmful scruples and
thoughts. He would come in between you and your thoughts
about that which benefits you. And what is more, it is you who
would be helping him against yourself, by making it easy for him
to possess your heart and your ideas; so he gains control of
them over yourself.

Your likeness to himis 35 the likeness of the owner of a mill in
which, good grain is ground. Then a man came to him with a
load of soil, dung, coal and scum in order to grind them in his
mill. If he rejects him and does not make it possible for him to
throw that which is with him in the mill, he would be able to
continue grinding that which is useful for him. But if he makes it
possible for him to throw them into the miil, they would ruin the
grain that is in it, and the mill itself would be ruined.

That which Satan throws into the heart is usually one of the
following thoughts: thinking about things that exist, if they were
other than the way they are now. About things that have not
existed, if they were to exist, how they would be. About things
that can be thought about such as immorality and prohibited
things. Illusory imagination that has no reality at all or about
null and void things. That which cannot be perceived like the
kinds of things that have been kept secret from his knowledge.
He would throw these ideas into him that would not come to an
end, and make them the center of his concern and thought.

The remedy for this is to preoccupy your thoughts with
knowledge and concepts that are useful for you, regarding the
Oneness of Allah and His Rights, and about death and its
aftermath like Paradise and Hellfire. Also it is important to
preoccupy yourself with learning the problems of deeds and the
ways to avoid them.

You should preoccupy yourself with will and intention and that
which is useful for you and reject that which is harmful.

According to the most knowledgeable people of Allah, wishing
for treason and preoccupying yourself with it, is more harmful
to the heart than treason itself. You can find this in the example
of a king. Among the King’s retinues and servants is one who
would like to betray him and his heart and thoughts are full of
this, yet at the same time he serves him and performs his
duties. If the king comes to know his secret and intention, he
would hate him so profoundly that he would punish him with
what he deserves.

He would be more hated to him than a man who is far away
from him, and has committed some crime, but whose heart is
with the king, and does not contain any wish for treason. The
first one leaves it due to being weak and busy with that which
he is doing, while his heart is full of it, but the second one
commits these crimes, while his heart is void of any treason or
desire to do it. Therefore, he is better than the first one.

In general, the heart is never void of thought. It is either
concerned with a duty concerning the Hereafter, or worldly
pleasures.

We have previously mentioned that the mind is like a mill that
runs with that which is thrown into it. If some grain is thrown in,
it would run with it. And if glass, pebbles or dung is thrown in,
it would run with it too. it is Allah, the Almighty Who is the Lord,
the Owner and Manager of that mill. He has appointed an angel
to throw in it that, which ts beneficial to run with it, and Satan
throws that which harms it.

The angel visits it one time, and Satan visits it at another time.
The grain that the angel throws is an indication of goodness
and belief in the promise. And the grain that Satan throws is
an indication of evil and disbelief in the promise.

The mill runs according to the grain. And the owner of the
harmful grain would not be able to throw it except if he finds the
mill void of useful grain, and the one who is running it has

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 295

neglected it and turned away from it. By then, he would take the
initiative to throw that, which he likes.

In general, if the one who runs the mill abandons it and gives
up taking care of it by not throwing useful grain, the enemy
would find the way to ruin it and run it with that which he has.
And the way to reform this mill is by being preoccupied with
that which concerns you. And as for its destruction, it is by
being preoccupied with that which does not concern you.

How excellent the statement of a wise man is, as he put it:
when | found that worldly pleasures are more likely to spoil the
Hereafter, and saw that it is bound to be ruined, | turned away
from it all to that which people of understanding do not differ in
opinion.

Shafiq bin Ibrahim °° said, “The door of success has been
closed against the creation due to six matters”:

their being preoccupied with grace without being grateful.
their interest in knowledge and neglecting action.
rushing to sin and delaying repentance.

being attracted by the company of the righteous but failing to
follow their deeds.

This worldly life is turning away from them. while they strongly
desire it.

The Hereafter is drawing near to them, while they are turning
away in heedlessness.

| said, the source of that is lack of desire for (Paradise) and lack
of fear of Hellfire, as well as weakness of certainty and insight,

and disgrace and lowness of the self, and exchanging that,
which is better for that which is lower. Otherwise, if the self was
truly noble and great, it would not accept such lowness.

Therefore, the source of all good with success is from Allah
and His Will. And tnis is also the source of nobility of the self
and its greatness. And the source of evil is its lowness and
pettiness. Allah, the Almighty said in the Glorious Qur'an,

« قد أفلح + ‎LESS‏ )485 حاب من ‎1D) GMS‏ €

which means, “Indeed he succeeds who purifies his ownself
(i.e. obeys and performs all that Allah ordered, by following the
true Faith of Islamic Monotheism and by doing righteous good
deeds). And indeed he fails who corrupts his ownself (i.e.
disobeys what Allah has ordered by rejecting the true Faith of
Islamic Monotheism or by following polytheism, etc. or by doing
every kind of evil wicked deeds).” (Ash-Shams, 91:9-10)

That is to say that the successful one is he, who honors it,
invests it by obeying and performing all that Allah ordered. And
the unsuccessful one is the one who belittles it and degrades it
by disobeying what Allah has ordered.

Therefore, honored servants are only pleased with the highest,
best and most praised matters. But the inferior servants hover
about lowness and fall upon them just as a fly falls upon the
dirt.

The honored and high self does not accept wrongdoing or
immorality, theft or treason, for it is greater and higher than
them. And the despised and low self is the opposite of that, for
every self inclines to that which suits and resembles it. The
following verse illustrates this fact,

-— 1 1 17 80 ‏ور هدم‎ 4 ma
Se “ee ~

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ٠» 7

which means, “Say (OQ Muhammad to mankind): "Each one
does according to Shakilatihi (i.e. his way or his religion or his
intentions, etc.)” (Al-Isra’, 17:84)

That is to say that everyone performs deeds according to that
which suits and corresponds to him. He performs deeds
according to the way that coincides with his character and
nature. Everyone follows his way, his faith and habits that he
got used to and was created with.

Therefore, the immoral person performs deeds according to
that which resembles his way of life, as repaying grace with
sins, and turning away from the Benefactor. And the believer
performs deeds according to his way of life, as being grateful to
the Benefactor, showing his love and praise to Him, making
himself loved by Him, being shy of Him, observing Him,
glorifying Him and exalting Him.

Chapter: He who does not Know himself, does not
Know his Creator ‏ظ‎

How can the one who does not know himself, know His
creator? Know that Allah, the Exalted created a heart within
your chest. Allah, the Almighty established Himself on the
Throne by Himself and is clear to His creatures if their hearts
are pure. On the bed of the heart there is a carpet of content
and on its right and left sides there are utilities of its laws and
commands. There is a door that is opened to it hoping for
Paradise, His mercy, and longing to meet Him. It was rained on
with truth, which planted all kinds of fruitful trees from among
the forms of worship and remembering Allah. In the middle of
this garden there is a tree of knowledge which brings forth its
fruit at all times by the leave of its Lord, which are things like
loving, repentance, piety, fearing, and happiness at being close
to Him. He watered it with meditation, understanding, and
working according to His words. Inside the house a lamp is
hung that is lit with knowing and believing in Allah. After that

298 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

he built a wall around it that prevents any disease and
corruption from entering. Whoever seeks to harm the garden
will not succeed. He appointed guards from the Angels to
protect him in his wakefulness and repose. Then he let the
owner of the house and the garden know about the dweller; as
his aim is always to repair the house so as to gain the
satisfaction of the dweller and if he felt any problem in the
house, he would repair it at once fearing that the dweller may
leave. How good the house is and how good the dweller is.

Glorified be Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. There is a great
difference between this house and another house that is
captured by destruction and has become a shelter for insects
and bugs; a place for all that is dirty. Whoever wants relief,
can find this ruined house without a dweller or a keeper. It is not
prepared for relief, it is dark and has a foul odor, and is full of
dirt and destruction. No one wants to be in it except insects and
worms. Satan is on its bed, the bed has a carpet of ignorance
accompanied with desires, its right and left sides have utilities
of desires, a door is opened to it and it leads 10 betrayal,
loneliness, seeking this worldly life, and neglecting the
Hereafter, and it is rained upon by a heavy rain of ignorance,
desire, polytheism, and innovations, which planted all kinds of
thorns, colocynth, and fruitful trees from among sins and
breaches that provoke committing what is forbidden and
neglecting worship. In the middle of the garden there is a tree
of ignorance and neglecting Allah which brings its fruit at all
times in the form of sins, debauchery, amusements,
impudence, and following every desire. From among its fruit is
distress, sadness, and pain, but they are hidden because the
soul is busy with amusements. But when it wakes up from its
drunken state it suffers from all kinds of distress, sadness,
hardship, and anxiety. He watered this tree by following desires,
deceptive hope, and pride.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 299

Then he abandons this house with its darkness and destruction
in a way that did not prevent any corrupt, animal, harmful, or
dirty thing from entering. Whoever knows his house, the value
of he who dwells in it, the value of its treasures and the
supplies he benefits from in his life and himself, and whoever
is ignorant of these, would be ignorant about himself and
would loose his happiness.

At-Tastary was asked once, "A man eats one meal during his
day. He said, ‘The way of truthful people.’ They said, 'What
about two meals?’ He said, 'The way of the believers.' They
said, What about three?’ He said, ‘Tell his family to build a
place of fodder for him."

Al-Aswad bin Salim said: to perform two rak'ahs is preferred to
me than Paradise and all that it contains. It was said to him:
this is wrong. He said: neglect your words and listen: Paradise
will please me and the two rak’ahs will please My Lord; pleasing
My Lord is more important that pleasing myself.

e A learned man on earth is like basil from Paradise, if
one of his followers smells it, his soul will long — for
Paradise.

e The heart of the lover is placed between the loftiness
and beauty of the one he loves. If he notices His
loftiness, he would fear and glorify Him and if he notices
His beauty, he would love and long for Him.

A Precious Gem: Levels of Knowing Allah

There are among people those who know Allah through His
favors, blessings, and grace, others know Him through His
forgiveness and mercy, others know Him through revenge and
force, others know Him through knowledge and wisdom, pride
and glory, mercy, piety, and kindness, overpowering and
Ownership, and through answering supplications, helping in
grief, and fulfilling needs.

300 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

The highest among those in knowing Allah is the one who
knows Him through His words; he knows the Lord has ail the
attributes of perfection and all the characteristics of glory, far
above having a parallel, and free from any defects and faults.
He has every good name and every perfect attribute, the doer
of all that He intends, above all matters and accompanies every
matter, capable of every matter and builds every matter,
absolute master, speaks with His Divine words, greater than
every matter and more beautiful than anything, the most
merciful among those who show mercy, the most powerful
among those who have power, and the most wise among those
who have wisdom. The Qur'an was revealed to inform His
servants about Him, the Way that leads to Him, and the
conditions of those who followed in His way after knowing Him.

A Precious Gem: Allah will not Change the
Condition of a People until They Change
Themselves

Quite often the servant of Allah is granted abundant blessings
but he becomes bored and longs to change it for another
which he claims ts better. In fact, Allah, the Merciful does not
deprive him of this blessing, and He excuses him for his
ignorance and bad choice until the servant is unable to bear
the blessing, feels discontent, and complains about it. Then
Allah will take it away from him. When he gets what he wished
for and sees the great difference between what he had before
and what he has now, he is filled with worry and regret and he
wishes to have what he had before. If Allah wishes good for
His servant, He would make him see that whatever blessings
he now has 5 from Allah and He will show him that Allah is
pleased with him, and the servant would praise Him. If he is
deceived by his soul to change this blessing, he would ask
Allah for guidance.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 1

There is nothing more harmful to the servant than becoming
bored from the blessings of Allah; as he neither sees them as a
blessing, praises Allah for them, nor is happy with them but he
becomes bored, complains, and considers them as a means of
distress. He does not think that these things are from the
greatest blessings of Allah. The majority of people are opposed
to the blessings of Allah. They do not feel the blessings of
Allan, and moreover, they exert their effort to drive them away
because of their ignorance and injustice. How often is a
blessing bestowed on a person while he is exerting his effort
to drive it away and how often does he actually receive it while
he is pushing it away, simply because of his ignorance and
injustice. Allah says,

3

© ‏بأنفيبح‎ Giga > 255 ‏يَعَمَهَأَنَعَمَهَا على‎ ay TT ‏ذَلِكَ بأرى‎ ١

which means, “That is so because Allah will never change a
grace which He has bestowed on a people until they change
what is in their ownselves." (Al-Anfal, 8:53)

And He, the amen says,

42 4 Sue ‏و‎ a - + fur 8 HGF og

which means, “Allah will not change the good condition of a
people as long as they do not change their state of goodness
themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and
disobedient to Allah)." (Ar-Ra'd, 13:11)

What can be worse than the enmity of a servant toward the
blessings he has received? In so doing, he supports his enemy
against himself. His enemy arouses fire in his blessings and he
increases the fire unawares. He enables his enemy to _ light
the fire and then he helps his own enemy to blow on it until it
becomes strong. Finally, he seeks help against the fire and
blames fate.

Chapter: The Beauty of Allah, the Exalted

The most precious kind of knowledge e is to know Allah, the
Exalted through His beauty. This is granted to the truly pious
among His creatures, while others know Him through one of His
attributes, while those who know Him the best know Him
through His perfection, glory, and beauty. There is nothing like
Him in His attributes. If we assume that all creatures are
beautiful and we think of the most beautiful one we know, and
compare their inner and outer beauty to that of Allah, the
Exalted, it will be like we are comparing the light of a candle to
the sun. Surely, if He withdraws the veil from His face, the
splendor of His countenance would consume His creation. The
beauty that is contained in the inner and outer elements of this
worldly life and the Hereafter comes from the effect of His
creation. What then, is the extent of beauty of the Creator?

He has all glory, power, charity, generosity, knowledge, and
favor. With the light of His face, all darkness disappears. As
the Prophet (peace be upon him) said in supplication of At-Ta’if,
"| seek refuge with Your Face that darkness will go and without
which both the affairs of this life and the Hereafter will go
astray."

‘Abdullah bin Mas'td (may Allah be pleased with him) said,
‘Allah does not have either night or day: the light of the
Heavens and the earth is from the light of His face." Allah, the
Exalted is the light of the heavens and the earth and on the
Day of Resurrection when Allah will judge mankind, the earth
will shine from His light. From among the names of Allah is
"the most Graceful." It was recorded in the sahih that the

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Verily, Allah is Graceful and
He loves Grace."°’

The beauty of Allah is on four levels: the beauty of self, the
beauty of His attributes, the beauty of His deeds, and the
beauty of His names. All His names are beautiful, His attributes
are all attributes of perfection, and His deeds are all wise, just,
and merciful, and He considers the benefit of man. Only Allah
knows the beauty of self and what it is like, and His creatures
only have some definitions that He bestowed upon some of His
servants that He honored. This beauty is preserved away from
others and is covered by a veil and a lower garment, as the
Messenger (peace be upon him) said, “Pride is my cloak and
majesty is my lower garment." And because pride is wider and
greater, it deserves the name of cloak, as Allah is the Greatest
and the Most High.

lon ‘Abbas said, "Allah covered His self with attributes and
covered His attributes with deeds. What do you think about a
beauty that is covered by the attributes of perfection and of
glory and loftiness?"

From this some other meanings of beauty can be understood.
The servant achieves progress from knowing the deeds and
then the attributes, and from knowing the attributes to knowing
the self. If he saw something among the beauty of deeds, he
would reach the beauty of attributes and then he reaches the
beauty of the self.

So all praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Exalted , and
none of His creation can praise Him as He deserves, but
only as He praises Himself and He deserves to be worshiped,
loved, and praised. He loves His attributes and deeds as He
loves His self. All of His deeds are beautiful and precious and
there is nothing hateful among His deeds. There is nothing in

97 Recorded by Muslim, book of faith, chapter forbiddance of pride, no.91.

304 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

the universe that is loved and praised except Allah, the
Exalted. And whatever is loved other than Him, if love is for the
sake of Allah, this love is lawful otherwise it is not. And this is
the reality of Lordship. s The true Lord is the one that is loved
and praised. What then if we add to that His charity, favor,
mercy, forgiveness, and piety?

The servant should know that there is no god but Allah, so he
would love and praise Him for His self and for His perfection
and should know that there is no one that grants secret and
public favors and blessings except Him, so he would love Him
for His compassion and blessings. As there is nothing similar to
Him, loving Him is not like any kind of love; loving with
submission is the kind of worship that Allah created all things
for. It is the utmost love with the utmost humility and it cannot
be shown except to Allah. Indeed to show it to other than Him is
polytheism that Allah does not forgive if the doer dies in that
state.

Praising Him includes two matters: being informed about His
praiseworthy acts and His attributes of perfection, and loving
Him because of them. If someone informs another person about
their praiseworthy acts without loving him, he is not praising
him. And whoever loves him without informing others about his
praiseworthy acts, he is not praising him until he combines the
two matters. Allah, the Exalted praises Himself by Himself and
praises Himself by the tongues of those who praise Him from
among the angels, the Prophets, the Messengers, and the
believers. They praise Him according to His wish and by His
permission. He is the one, Who enables them to praise Him,
and all things are done with His permission. All blessings begin
and end with Him; they begin with His praise and end with His
praise. He inspires His servant to repent and is happy with it
while it is from His favor and generosity and He inspires His
servant to obey, helps him to do that, and rewards him for it!
He is in no need of anything but all things are in deep need of

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 305

Him at all times. The servant needs Him to help him to achieve
his aims. Whatever is not permitted by Him will never be and
whatever is not done for His sake is useless.

Chapter: Allah is Full of Grace and He loves Grace

When the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Verily, Allah is
Graceful and He loves Grace," he meant an indirect kind of
beauty included in all matters. As when he (peace be upon
him) said in another hadith, "Verily, Allah is Clean and He loves
cleanliness."°? And, "0 people, Allah is Good and He therefore,
accepts only that which is good."”” And it was recorded in As-
Sunan, "Verily, Allah loves to see the effect of His blessings on

He said, 'Yes.' Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked,
'What kind?’ He said, ‘Allah granted me camels and sheep. He
said, 'Let His blessings and dignity be seen on ‏".ناولا‎

Allah, the Exalted loves to see the effect of His blessings on His
servant; it is among the beauty that He loves. It is a way of
praising Him for His blessings, which is an inner beauty and He
also loves to see the outer beauty brought about by His
blessings on His servant and the inner one by thanking Him.
And as Allah loves grace, He provided man with clothing and
decoration that beautifies their outer appearance, as well as
piety that will beautify their inner selves. Allah, the Almighty

upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts, etc.)

which means, "And gave them Nadratan (a light of beauty) and
joy. And their recompense shall be Paradise, and _ silken
garments, because they were patient." (Al-Insan, 76:11-12)

Allah beautifies their outer face by that light, their inner one with
joy and their bodies with silken garments. As He loves beauty
in sayings, deeds, clothing, and appearance, and He hates
ugliness in sayings, deeds, clothing, and appearance. He
hates ugliness and its people and loves beauty and its people.
But the two groups were misled concerning this subject: one
group said that all that Allah has created is graceful, and He
loves whatever He created, and we live with all that He created
and do not hate any part of it. And whoever sees any of His
creatures, will find that they are all graceful. Allah mentions this
saying,

(As-Sajdah, 32:7)

which means, "You can see no fault in the creations of the Most

And the most pious among them is he who declares that beauty
is absolute and that there is no ugliness in the universe. Their
hearts lack all jealousy for the sake of Allah because of His love
for beauty. While others worship Allah and perhaps some of
them might exceed the limits and claim that his alleged lord is
revealed in this shape and eminent in it. If he was a
consolodationist,’” he would say that it was an aspect from
among aspects of right and would call it aesthetic aspects.

Chapter: Kinds of Beauty

The other group disagreed with them and said that Allah, the
Exalted dispraised the beauty of outer figures and the
perfection of the body and creation. He, the Almighty says
about the hypocrites,

Consolidation {ittinad): A doctrine adopted by some deviant mystic groups and

the entity of God is consolidated or unified with the entities of His Creatures,
so that both entities become all in one. (Definitior translated with summary

not deny perception but that this perception is not what brings
about love. They said that He forbade wearing silken clothes,

are among the most beautiful things in the world. Allah says,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 9

And the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Wearing old
clothes is a part of faith." Allah dispraises spendthrifts.
Wasting food and drink is like wasting clothing.

To solve this dispute it must be said: beauty of shape, clothing,
and appearance is of three kinds: some of it is praiseworthy,
some is dispraised, and some would be neither praised nor
dispraised. The kind that is praised is what is done for the
sake of Allah and that which helps in obeying Him, fulfilling His
orders, and answering His demands. The Prophet (peace be
upon him) used to adorn himself to meet delegations, as he
used to wear clothing of war preparing himself to fight, and
when he wore silken clothes during wars, everything he did
was praised 35 it was done for the sake of Allah, raising His
word, supporting His religion, and irritating His enemy, while
that which is dispraised is what is done seeking this worldly life,
gaining authority, pride, and desires and if it was done for a
human being. The majority of souls do not have any intention
to do other than this. What is neither praised nor dispraised is
that which is at variance with these two aims and the two
descriptions.

What is meant here is that this honorable hadith includes two
great bases: the first is knowledge and the second is behavior,
which is to know Allah, the Exalted through His beauty, which
has no similarity and to worship Allah through what He loves
from among the beauty of sayings, deeds, and manners. Allah
loves His servant to beautify his tongue through speaking the
truth, his heart through sincerity, repentance, and trust, his body
through obeying, and through showing the blessings of Allah in
his clothing, purifying it from all dirt, impurities, ritual impurities,
and undesired hair, and performing circumcision and cutting

Hajar said: it has an authentic chain of transmission, see Fath Al-Bary,

one’s nails. The servant will know Him through His attributes of
beauty and become acquainted with Him through the beauty
of His deeds, sayings, and manners. He would know Him
through the beauty, which He is described with and will
worship Him through the beauty, which is His law and religion.

Chapter: Sincerity of Determination and Deeds

There is nothing more useful to the servant of Allah than being
sincere with his Lord in ail matters, especially sincerity in
determination. The servant should be sincere in both his
determination and in his deed. Allah, the Almighty says,

Gh Se ‏ل‎ ep ‏:م هد‎ tee one hw. ‏اي‎

which means, "And when the matter (preparation for Jihad) is
resolved on, then if they had been true to Allah, it would have
been better for them.’ (Muhammad, 47:21)

He will find happiness by being sincere in both determination
and the truth of his deeds. Sincerity of determination is
achieved through resolving and removing any hesitation.|f he is
sincere in his determination, the truth of his deeds still remains
to be fulfilled, which is dedicating one’s power and efforts
without loosing anything from either the inner or the outer.
Determination prevents weakness of will and intention, and the
truthful deed prevents him from laziness and apathy. And
whoever is true to Allan in all matters, Allah will grant him
more than He does with others. This truth is a means that
results from combining true sincerity and pure trust. The most
truthful among people are those who are granted these
characteristics.

A Precious Gem: The Will of the Servant

Allah has will and He orders His servant who also has a will to
fulfill His commands, and if Allah wills to support and help him,

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 311

he would fulfill His commands, but if He leaves him to his own
will and soul, the servant will follow the desires of his soul as he
is amere human. That is why Allah dispraised him in His book
from this point and only praised him for being a Muslim, a
believer, patient, charitable, thankful, pious, etc. which is more
than just being a human being, who has a will. It is not enough
to just have a will unless it is combined with something extra,
which is success. It is just like having gocd eyes is not enough
to see unless you also have a good light.

Chapter: Glorifying Allah

It is the pinnacle of injustice and ignorance to ask to be
glorified and honored by people while your heart does not
glorify or honor Allah. You are honoring a creature and
glorifying and protecting him from seeing you in the real state
that Allah sees you in. Allah says,

a
“

- og ao ut ob
B85 ab ‏ترجون‎ VIN ‏ما‎ «

which means, "What is the matter with you, [that you fear not
Allah (His punishment), and] you hope not for reward (from
Allah or you believe not in His Oneness)?" (N&h, 71:13)

That is you do not glorify Him or honor Him. As Allah says,
4 2... 0978555... >

which means, "And honor Him." (Al-Fath, 48:9)

Al-Hasan said: why do you not know the worth of Allah and
why do you not praise Him? Mujahid said: you do not care to
honor your Lord. Ibn Zaid said: you do not believe in obeying
Allah. lon ‘Abbas said: you do not know the worth of His glory.

All these sayings bear one meaning, which is if they glorify
Allah and know the worth of His glory, they would believe in His
oneness, and obey, and praise Him. Obeying Him, avoiding

312 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

sins, and feeling ashamed in front of Him are able to be done
according to the amount ‏عه‎ glorifies Him inside his heart.
That is why some of our pious prececessors said: in order to
increase the glorification of Allah inside the heart of anyone
among you, mention Him when he is ashamed of mentioning
Him and combine His name with other names. This is the way
to glorifyAllah.

To glorify Allah is to never say He has an equal with any of
His creation either in words as when one says, By Allah and by
your life, | do not have anyone except Allah and you, and
whatever Allan wishes and you wish, nor in loving, honoring,
and obeying like obeying what a person orders or forbids, or
even greater as the majority of unjust and dissolute people do.
Also not to fear or hope for anything except Allah, or to care for
Him less than you care for others. Man should never
underestimate the worth of Allah and should never say that
Allah used to forgive us. He should never give priority to
creatures over Allah, nor put Allan and His Messenger on one
side and people on the other, and join the side, which includes
people and neglect the side, which has Allan and His
Messenger. He should not dedicate his heart and soul to
creatures while talking and give Allah the body and tongue
without the heart and soul while worshiping Him, and he should
never give priority to his desires over the orders of Allah.

All this is required to glorify Allah within the heart. And
whoever fails to do that, Allah will never grant him honor and
glory in the hearts of people but indeed, He would remove from
their hearts any honor and glorification for him. Even if they
honor him for fear of his evil acts, this is honor resulting from
hate, not honor from love and glory. Also glorifying Allah is to
feel ashamed to let Allah know his secret and conscience and
know what He would hate. Also to feel ashamed in front of Him
while in a place of privacy more than one feels ashamed in the
presence of influential people.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

What is meant here is how can the one who does not glorify
Allah, His words, and the knowledge and wisdom that He
granted him, ask people to glorify and honor him? The Qur'an,
knowledge, and speech of the Messenger (peace be upon him)
are all warnings and restraints that have been sent to you in
addition to white hair; it is a warning and a restraint for yOu,
which exists within you. But neither what We have sent to you
restrains you nor what is in your body advises you. Still you ask
others for glorification and honor. You are like the one who was
afflicted but did not profit from it and asks others to profit from
his distress.

Whoever hears about the punishments and warnings that
happened to others is not the same as he who sees them with
his own eyes, so what about the one who tasted them in
himself? Allah says,

as - Jie let ‏سكاع :و‎ te
which means, "We will show them Our Signs in the universe,

and in their ownselves." (Fussilat, 41:53)

His signs are known and heard throughout the universe and
His signs in the souls are recognized by the pious. May Allah
protect us from being disappointed. Allah says,

(Yunus, 10:96-97)

And He, the Almighty says,

‎Sl pil Se LT 6) Wy I 55}‏ وَحَسَرنَا ‎SUS ch OF age‏ ما كاثوأ

‎which means, “And even if We had sent down unto them
angels, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had
gathered together all things before their very eyes, they would
not have believed, urless Allah willed." (Al-An'am, 6:111)

‎The rational servant, who advocates success without having
this, is completing the defects of his creation by virtue of his
manners and deeds. Whenever his body loses the effect of
worshiping Allah, he would increase his faith in another effect
and whenever his body loses its power he would increase the
power of his faith, belief, and seeking Allah and the Hereafter.
lf he was not like this, death would be better for him because
he stops at a specific level of pain and corruption regardless of
his defects and faults. It increases his pain, sadness, and
regret, while if he lives for a long time it might be good and
useful if it is used in remembering, catching what has past,
seizing opportunities, and sincere repentance. Allah says,

‎oer 2 (at tee 6 Bos ‏ري‎

‎which means, "Did We not give you lives long enough, so that
whosoever would receive admonition, - could receive it?" (Fatir,
35:37)

‎Whoever attains old age and life did not make him repair his
defects and catch up with his past, and seize the rest of his life
in order to seek the life of his heart and permanent pleasures,
then his life would have been useless.

‎The servant is traveling either to Paradise or to Hellfire. If he
had a long life and his deeds were good, his long journey would
be the means of an increase in pleasure for him. The more the

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 315

journey was long, the more the longing would be better and
loftier. If he reached old age but his deeds were evil, his long
journey would be a means of increase in his pain and
punishment and a means to take him lower. The traveler is
either being taken up or down. In a traceable hadith, the
Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "The best amongst you is he
whose life time extends during which he performs good deeds
and the worst amongst you is he whose life time extends during
which he performs evil deeds."

Whoever is sincere in seeking Allah, whenever something from
himself is damaged, he uses it to raise his heart and soul, and
whenever something from his worldly life decreases, he would
use it to increase his hereafter. Whenever ‏عط‎ is prevented
from some _ of the pleasures of this worldly life, he would use it
to increase the pleasures of the hereafter, and whenever he is
afflicted with distress, sadness, or grief, he would use it to
increase the joys of the hereafter. The more there is a decrease
in his body, life, pleasure, power, and authority, the more he
gains in his resurrection and it would be a mercy and good for
him, otherwise it would be a prevention and punishment for the
sins he had committed either in public or secret or for
neglecting an obligatory act of worship either in secret or in
public, as the good of this worldly life and of the Hereafter
depends upon these four. May Allah grant us success.

A Precious Gem: Life is a Journey

From the very moment of creation, mankind is on a journey. He
is a traveler and is not allowed to halt except when he
reaches either Paradise or Hellfire. The wise one among them
is the one who knows that traveling is based on hardship and
danger. It is usually hard to seek pleasures and relief during it,

”® Recorded By At-Tirmidhy, book of asceticism, chapter on what is mentioned
about long life time of believers, no.2329, Ad-Darimy, book of softening of
hearts, chapter on which among believers is the best, no.2742.

316 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

which are to be acquired after it is completed. Every footstep
and every moan made during this journey will not stop him. It
is proven that the traveler is preparing supplies, which will take
him to his final end. And if he halts, sleeps, or rests, he is doing
so while preparing himself to complete his journey.

A Precious Gem: Observing

Scholars agreed that keeping oneself busy with observing
instead of walking seriously is in fact stopping, because if we
use the time that is spent observing in performing any good
deed either public or secret, increasing our knowledge, or
strengthening our faith, it would have priority. Mankind will be
resurrected according to the kinds of deeds he performed with
knowledge, intention, and will. The body will be resurrected
according to its deeds whether good or bad. When we are
removed from this world, we will see the reality of that. As
much as your heart is close to Allah, you will be removed from
people and from mixing with them and as much as you keep
your secret and your will, Allah will protect you. The core of all
this is the truth of monotheism, then the truth of knowing the
straight path, then the truth of will, and then the truth of deeds.
And be very wary of people who seek you and know your aim,
as itis a great disease.

A Precious Gem: The Satanic Ways of Tempting
Satan has three ways of tempting man:

One: increase and extravagance; to have more than one
needs. This addition is the way, which Satan uses to enter the
heart. To protect oneself from that is to be careful not to fulfill
all the needs of the soul like food, sleep, pleasure, or rest.
Whenever you close this door, you would be safe from any
enemy.

Two: negligence; whoever remembers Allah is protected by the
fortress of remembering Him. When he neglects that he will be

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings ® 317

opening the door of this fortress and the enemy will enter. It
would then be difficult to drive him out.

Three: caring for what is not his business in all matters of life.

A Precious Gem: The Way to Success

Whoever wants to reach Allah and the Hereafter and attain all
knowledge, craft, and authority in a way that he will be ahead
of these matters and be followed in that, needs to be
courageous, bold, in control of his desires, not to be governed
by the authority of his imagination, renouncing all his needs,
love what he is heading toward, knowing the way to it and the
ways that interrupt it, and have a strong intention and a firm will
that nothing would turn him away from its aim. Such a person
would not be affected by blame or reproach, and would usually
be quiet and think seriously. He would never be inclined to
follow either the pleasure of praise or the pain of dispraise. He
would be secure of what he needs from all the means of
support, would not be provoked by disagreements, and would
adopt the motto of patience and his relief would be found in
working hard, love for high moral Standards, being on _ time,
being careful while mixing with people like a bird when it looks
for its seeds, preserving himself through hope and fear, hoping
for the results of being special above his kind, not to lose any of
his senses in useless matters, and not to lose his mind in
contemplating the levels of the universe. In order to achieve all
that, he should abandon the habits and obstacles that lie
between him and what he wants. The public used to say: to
have hidden manners is better than losing one’s manners in
public.

A Precious Gem: The Best Kinds of
Remembrance

Among those who remember Allah are those who begin
remembering with the tongue even if he is negligent. He

318 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

continues to do so until his heart is involved too. Others do not
agree with that and do not start while in a state of negligence,
but instead wait until the heart is ready. He begins with his
heart and then involves his tongue in remembrance. The first
supplication goes from his tongue to his heart and the second
from his heart to his tongue without empting any of the contents
of his heart. He just waits until he feels that the utterance is
ready to be verbalized. When he feels that his heart will utter,
then the heart’s utterance would pass to verbal utterance. Then
he would engross himself in that until he finds that every part of
his being is supplicating Allah. The best and more useful kind
of supplication is what the heart and tongue are involved in, to
be from among the prophetic supplications, and whoever is
reciting it feels its meaning and aims.

Chapter: The Most Useful and the Most Harmful of
People

The most useful person is the one who allows a person to
implant goodness inside him or to do him a favor, as this help
is the means to attaining benefit and perfection. In fact, both
the giver and the receiver benefit. from this. The most harmful
of people are those who overpower you until you disobey Allah.
Such people only help you to harm yourself and decrease your
morality.

A Precious Gem: Forbidden Pleasure

Forbidden pleasure is combined with ugliness and it will cause
pain after the moment has passed. If you feel strongly inclined
toward it, you should think about the pain it will leave behind. It
is necessary to compare the two matters and discover the
difference between them. Suffering pain while worshiping
Allah is combined with a good soul that will bear the fruit of
pleasure and relief. When the soul finds it heavy and thinks to
stop the pain and then compares the end results of the two

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 319

matters, he will surely prefer the way of hardship. If you feel
pain because of deeds, you should think about the happiness,
joy, and pleasure you will gain, then the pain will seem easy to
bear. If you get hurt because of abandoning some kind of
forbidden pleasure, you should think about the pain that follows
itand compare the two kinds.

To make the correct choice, you must know the reasons and
consequences of each act and then choose that which is more
deserving and useful. Whoever succeeds at doing this, would
choose the better and prefer it. Whoever thinks about this
Worldly life and the Hereafter, would know that he will never
gain either of them except by hardship. He should bear this
hardship in order to gain the best and more lasting of them.

A Precious Gem: There is Right and Wrong in
Everything

When Allah created man, He established an order and a
system for each organ, and He ordained prohibitions for each
organ, granted a blessing for fulfilling each of them, and
specified a kind of pleasure and benefit that results from each
one. If the servant acts while using each organ for the sake of
Allah and avoids the prohibitions, he would be praising Allah
for granting him the blessings of each Organ and would
complete the potential benefit and pleasure from each one.
But if he neglects the orders of Allah and His prohibitions, Allah
will not allow him to benefit from any of them and moreover, He
will make it a cause of pain and harm.

Each organ of the body has the duty to worship Allah at all
times, which will bring one closer to Him. If he keeps himself
busy with worship, he will be close to Allah, but if he is busy
with his desires, seeking relief, or being idle, he will fail. The
servant is constantly fluctuating between being close to Allah
and being far from Him. Allah, the Exalted says,

320 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

‎ot ae an # ~ 7 7‏ سم
( لِمَن ‎ch‏ يكز أن ‎SE tis‏ :2 >

‎which means, "To any of you that chooses to go forward (by
working righteous deeds), or to remain behind (by committing
sins)." (Al-Muddathir, 74:37)

‎Chapter: The People of Paradise and those of
Hellfire

‎Allah, the Exalted created all things with a harmony between
order and prohibition, and giving and preventing, so they
became two parties: one party that neglected His order,
ignored His prohibitions, failed to praise Him or be grateful to
Him, and was dissatisfied when He prevented them from
something they wanted. Such people are His enemies and
their enmity increases or decreases according to the situations
that confront them. Another party said: we are Your servants. if
You give us an order we will hurry to fulfill it, if You prohibit us
from something we will restrain ourselves, if You give
something to us we will praise and thank You, and if You
prevent us from something we wanted, we will ask You and
supplicate to You. There is nothing between man and Paradise
except the veil of this worldly life. When death tears down that
veil, the pious people will remain forever in pleasure and
happiness. When the evil ones face death, the final veil will also
be torn down and there will be nothing between them and the
hellfire. When death tears down this veil, they will remain
forever in pain and regret.

‎The armies of this Worldly life and the Hereafter confront within
your heart and want to know to which you belong. If you look
sincerely within your heart, you will notice which one you
prefer and you will fight against the other. No person can
remain stagnant between them; you belong to one of them.
The first group restrains desires, takes the advice of the mind,
empties the heart so it can think about the aim behind their

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 1

creation, the body performs what it was ordered to do, and it
uses time to do what will benefit it in the Hereafter. It defeats
their short life by rushing to perform good deeds. It lives in this
worldly life while its heart is far removed trom it. It lives for the
Hereafter before going to it, it cares for Allah and obedience to
Him, and seeks to perform that which will increase their rank in
the hereafter, so Allah paid in advance by granting them the
pleasures of Paradise; is close to them and fills their hearts
with love and longing for Him and empties their hearts from
whatever fills the hearts of others like loving this life and
sadness and grief for losing it. So they feel a sense of ease
with the same things that others feel are difficult. They love
what others hate, and live this life with their bodies but their
souls are with the Exalted.

Chapter: Some Qualities of Monotheism

Monotheism is fine, chaste, clean, and pure. An evil thought,
word or action affects its standing in the heart of man, and just
a moment, a word, or a hidden desire confuse it. And if its
owner fails to hurry and remove this effect by doing its
opposite, it will become stronger and turn into a habit that is
hard to be removed.

These effects and impressions sometimes take place quickly
and also vanish quickly, while others happen fast but are slow
to vanish, and others are slow to happen and fast to vanish.

Some people have a strong sense of monotheism and are
able to withstand the effects of evil like a great amount of water
that catches only a little dirt. The person whose sense of
monotheism is not so strong, will be easily deceived and his
weakness will bear the harmful effects that strong monotheism
does not.

A place that is marked by purity will show its owner the cause of
its being soiled, so he has the chance to nurry and remove it
but the place that does not reach this level of purity will not do

322 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

that. Faith and monotheism go hand in hand and if they are
very strong, they would defeat evil in a way that weakness
cannot. The person who has good character will be forgiven for
sins that the one with bad character will not be forgiven for.
Having a sincere intention, a strong will and perfect obedience
change evil effects just like lying, a bad intention, and weak
obedience change good words and deeds according to their
ways.

A Precious Gem: Only the Heart that is Founded
on Monotheism Will Comprehend the Precious
Qualities of Allah

Abandoning desires for the sake of Allah will rescue the servant
from the punishment of Allah and will guarantee one to obtain
His mercy. The precious qualities of Allah, the treasure of piety,
pleasure, longing for Him, joy, and the happiness found in
being close to Him will never happen to the heart that cares for
anyone or anything besides Allah even if he was among the
people of worship, piety, and knowledge. Allah, the Exalted
refused to put His precious qualities into the heart that
associates others with Him and whose intention is to follow
other than Him. Instead He entrusts His precious qualities to
the heart that considers poverty as wealth as long as it is close
to Allah, and wealth as poverty if it is not close to Allah. It will
consider honor as humiliation and humiliation as honor, as well
as pleasure as punishment and punishment as pleasure. As a
whole, the servant who possesses such a heart neither knows
the meaning of life without Allah nor the meaning of death, pain,
sadness, grief, and distress that is associated with being far
from Him. The pious servant will gain two kinds of Paradise: the
Paradise of this worldly life and the Paradise on the Day of
Resurrection.

A Precious Gem: Al-Inadbah and AI-I'tikaf

Inabah is devotion of the heart to Allah, the Exalted like
devotion of the body inside the mosque without leaving it. That
is to say, devotion of the heart is to love and glorify Allah and
devote the actions of one’s body to Allah by worshipping
sincerely and following His Messenger. Whoever does not
devote his heart to Allah alone, would devote it to different
kinds of images. Allah says that Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be
upon him) said to his people,

which means, "What are these images, to which you are
devoted?" (Al-Anbiya’, 21:52)

He and his people shared the reality of devotion but his nation
chose devotion to graven images and he devoted himself to
Allah, the Exalted. Images are actually the plural of an image,
like pictures. When the heart is attached to, busy with and
following anything other than Allah, this is devotion of the heart
to images which appear to him in his heart similar to devotion
to the images of idols. That is why the polytheism of pagans
was by devoting their hearts, intentions, and wills to idols. For
this reason the Prophet (peace be upon him) called whoever
did so a servant of idols or images and invoked Allah against
him. He (peace be upon him) said, "Miserable be the
worshipper of the dinar and the dirham! Let him be miserable
and a looser, and let him never be healed even from the prick of
a thorn.”

Mankind are all travelers in this worldy life and every traveler is
heading toward his aim and will Stop at the place that pleases
him. Whoever seeks Allah and the Last Day is a traveler and
his aim in his travel is seeking the pleasure of Allah, and this is
his aim, intention and destiny. Allah says,

And Allah says that the wife of Firlawn (Pharoah) said,

which means, “My Lord! Build for me a home with You in
Paradise." (At-Tahrim, 66:12)

She asked for His companionship and the home of the
Hereafter before her earthly home.

Some Sayings of Sheikh ‘Aly

In a state between wakefulness and sleep it occurred to me: do
not show that you are in need of any other except Allah
otherwise He will double your need for you as a consequence
of violating your limits as His servant. He afflicted you with
poverty so that you would be purified so do not rid yourself of
the means of your reformation. Allah prescribed that poverty
would be your destiny and your wealth would be with Him, and
if you used your wealth to maintain a close relation with Him,
He would use His to do the same, but if you used yours to
seek your need from another, He would prevent His support to
you as a means of exile from His door. Do not depend on
anything that is lower and weaker than Him, as it will bring
about evil results and destroy you. If you depend on your
deeds, He will give you your due reward, if you depend on
knowledge alone, He will take it away from you, if you depend

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 5

on love, He will cause you to indulge in it, if you depend on
learning alone, He will make it a means of your destruction,
and if you depend on creatures, He will leave you to them. Be
satisfied with Allah as Your Lord and He will be satisfied with
you as His servant.

A Precious Gem: Sighing While Listening to the
Qur'an
Sighing while listening to the Qur'an or other than it has a
number of causes:

One: if while listening to the Qur'an a person experiences a
new degree that he never did before within himself and
becomes scared, this happens to him. This is a sigh of longing
to have this degree.

Two: if a sin is mentioned that he committed, he sighs out of
fear and sadness. This is a sigh of fear.

Three: if a fault or weakness is mentioned which he cannot
Stop or control, it will cause him sadness. his is a sigh of
sadness.

Four: when he perceives the perfection of his Lord and
discovers that the way to Him is closed. This is a sigh of
sadness and grief.

Five: if he forgets His Lord and is busy with other than Him
and this recitation reminds him of his Lord and outlines the
way to Him clearly and openly, this is a sigh of joy and
happiness.

Anyway, the cause of sighing is the strength and significance
of the event in comparison with the weakness of the person and
his ability to bear it or overcome it, along with the power of the
event when it happens inside him. If he shows it on his face, it
would cause the effect to be weak and would bring about its

326 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

end. This is the sigh, which comes from the true servant. The
one who tastes that is either truthful, a thief, or a hypocrite.

A Useful Rule: Kinds of Thoughts

The origin of good and evil begins in one’s thoughts. Thought
is the bases of will and seeking piety, love, and hate. The most
beneficial kinds of thoughts are those, which seek the benefits
of the Resurrection and the ways to gain them and the evils of
the Resurrection and the ways to avoid them. These are four of
the loftiest thoughts, and there are four others that follow
them: thought concerned with the benefits of this worldly life
and the ways to gain them and evil thoughts concerning this
worldly life and the ways to avoid them. These eight subjects
comprise the thoughts that wise people think. The head of the
first section is thinking about the blessings, favors, commands,
and prohibitions of Allah, about the ways to know Him, His
names and attributes from His Book and the Sunnah of His
Messenger and whoever follows him sincerely. Thoughts of
this kind will bring about love and knowledge. When he thinks
about the Hereafter, its honor and immortality and about this
worldly life and its meanness and ruin, he will wish for the
Hereafter and will neglect the other. The more he thinks about
the shortness of time and the absence of hope in front of him
in this worldly life, he will become more serious and diligent
and do his best to benefit from time and whatever avails him.

These thoughts will strengthen his intention and revive it after
its death and will make him steer his course in one way while
the others steer theirs in another way. Besides these thoughts,
there are also evil thoughts which get established in the
majority of hearts. These include thinking about what we are
not supposed to think about it and being preoccupied with
useless knowledge like the identity of Allah and His attributes
and other things, which the mind cannot comprehend.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7

Also thinking about non beneficial pass times like playing
chess, listening to music, and images and pictures of living
things.

As well as this are some of the sciences which do not elevate
the soul or bring about the development of man, like the details
of logic, mathematics and physics and many schools of
philosophy. Even if man understands the essence of such
things, it does not bring about perfection or honor.

Thinking about desires, pleasures, and ways to fulfill them, is
an aspect of evil thought. Even if man takes delight in them,
their harm during this worldly life and the Hereafter are greater
than the pleasure they provide.

Another example is thinking about what never happened. If it
had really happened, what would it have been like? Like for
example, thinking about what it would be like if one were a
king, found a treasure, or owned a garden. What would be
one’s manners and how would ‏همه‎ act, take, give, take
revenge, etc? These are the thoughts of foolish people.

Thinking about such people and the aspects of their lives,etc
are the kinds of thoughts of those who are far away from Allah,
His Messenger, and the Hereafter.

Thinking about and planning traps and tricks by which one can
achieve his desires and aims whether they are lawful or not,

Also thinking about the kinds of poetry that praise, criticize,
express feelings of love, lamentation, and others, as they
keep the servant busy and prevent him from thinking about his
real happiness and eternal life in the Hereafter.

Also thinking about imaginary concepts that are not conceivable
and moreover they are not necessary in human life. This is
found in every science even in jurisprudence, the principles of
Islam, and medicine. Such thoughts contain more harm than

328 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

good and keep the servant of Allah busy instead of thinking
about what is more useful.

An Important Rule: Making a Request and
Patience Thereafter

Making a request is a seed of faith. If faith and requesting are
combined they will have a good result. Trusting in Allah is the
seed of relying on Him and if He, the Almighty is approached
with sincerity, supplications will be answered. Fear is the seed
of love, and when it is combined with patience, the result is
obedience to Allah’s commands and avoidance of what He has
prohibited. Patience is the seed of belief, and it will make the
servant a strong believer. Allah, the Almighty says,

y=
(me)
‏َه‎

which means, "And We made from among them (Children of
Israel), leaders, giving guidance under Our Command, when
they were patient and used to believe with certainty in Our Ayat
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)."
(As-Sajdah, 32:24)Following the Messenger (peace be upon
him) truly is the seed of sincerity, and if they are all combined
they will lead to acceptance of one’s deeds. Hard work in
useful purposes is the seed of knowledge, and when they are
all combined, there will be success and happiness, but if they
are not, they will be of no use. Tolerance is the seed of
knowledge, and if they are combined they will bring about
mastery of this worldly life and the Hereafter and the scholar will
benefit from his knowledge. But if one of them separates from
the other, he will benefit nothing. Determination is the seed of
insight, and if they are united, the servant will gain all goodness
in this Worldly life and the Hereafter and his intention will
reach the highest levels of every place.

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 329

Lacking perfection is due to either lack of insight or lack of
determination. Good intention is the seed of a healthy mind, if
they are lacking all good is missed and if they are present,
they will bring about all good. A true opinion is the seed of
courage, and when they are combined there will be victory, but
If they are lacking there will be disappointment and failure.
Opinion found without courage, will result in cowardice and
deficiency. If there is courage without opinion, there will be
rashness and destruction. Patience is the seed of insight, and if
they are combined, all good will be found in their unity.

Al-Hasan, said: if you wish, you will see a servant who has
insight without having patience, and if you wish you will also
see one, who has patience without insight but when you see
who has both insight and patience, he is the successful! one.

Aavice is the seed of the mind. The stronger it is the more the
mind will be strong and enlightened. Remembering and thinking
are the seeds of each other, when they are combined, they will
encourage one to forsake this life and seek the Hereafter. Piety
is the seed of trust, if they are combined the heart will become
Straight. Preparing oneself is the seed to face weak hope, and
all good is in their unity and all evil is in their separation.
Sincere intention is the seed of strong determination, and if
they are combined, the servant will attain his greatest aim.

An Important Rule: The Servant Exists between
the Hands of Allah

The servant exists between hands of Allah at two times: while
Standing during performing prayer and standing on the Day of
Resurrection. Whoever fulfills the rights of the first standing, will
in fact be facilitating the second one, and whoever considers
this easy and does not pay due attention to it, he will be
making the other one difficult for himself. Allah, the Almighty
says,

‎which means, "And during night, prostrate yourself to Him (i.e.
the offering of Maghrib and ‘Isha’ prayers), and glorify Him a
long night through (i.e. Tahajjud prayer). Verily! These
(disbelievers) love the present life of this world, and put behind
them a heavy Day (that will be hard)." (Al-Insan, 76:26-27)

‎An Important Rule: The Pleasure of the Hereafter
is More Lasting

‎Pleasure from this point of view is that needed by man but it is
better to be free of it if it will cause the loss of what is greater
than it and, which is more perfect than it or if it will cause pain
that is much greater than the pain that will be caused if we
missed it. Here we find the difference between the wise and
intelligent person and the foolish and ignorant one. Whenever
the mind of man comprehends the difference between these
two pleasures and the two kinds of pain associated with them
and discovers that there is no comparison between the two, it
will be easy for the mind to abandon the lower pleasure in
order to gain the higher, and it will be easier to bear the easier
pain and to avoid the harder one.

‎since this is the case, the pleasure of the Hereafter is greater
and more lasting, and the pleasure of this worldly life is lower
and has a shorter duration. That is also the case concerning
the pain of the Hereafter and that of this worldly life. The
criterion here is according to one’s faith and belief. If belief is
strong and governs the heart, he will prefer the higher (eternal)
pleasures more than the lower ones, and will bear the easier
pain more than the hardest one in the Hereafter.

A Precious Gem: And Ayydb (Job) when he cried
to his Lord!

Allah, the Almighty says,
My + ati cel ce te ee thee Vert, ae
4) nel ‏ارّحم‎ Cals pall gms ‏وَايُوببَ ]3 نادئ )740 ابي‎ «

which means, "And (remember) AiyGb (Job), when he cried to
his Lord: "Verily, distress has seized me, and You are the Most
Merciful of all those who show mercy." (Al-Anbiya’, 21:83)

Aiyub (Job, peace be upon him) combined many elements in
his supplication. He inferred the reality of monotheism,
expressing his need to Allah, showing love for Him and
longing for Him, acknowledging the attribute of His mercy and
that He is the Most Merciful among those who show mercy, and
being humble in front of Allah because of His attributes and by
showing his need for Him. Whenever someone is in trouble
and finds this feeling in himself, his distress will be removed.

A Precious Gem: You are my Protector in this Life
and in the Hereafter

Allah says that Ydsuf (Joseph, peace be upon him) said,

de

9 ear? TE 8 or oe ‏رمي‎ eee EE
4 2 ball ‏والحقنى‎ Gls ga ‏والأجرة‎ WUT ‏وَنَ- فى‎ Cal... >

which means, "You are my Wali (Protector, Helper, Supporter,
Guardian, etc.) in this world and in the Hereafter, cause me to
die as a Muslim (the one submitting to Your Will), and join me
with the righteous." (Ydsuf, 12:101)

This supplication combined the acknowledgment of
monotheism, submission to Allah, showing one’s need for Him,
being free of taking any supporters other than Him, expressing
that dying while being a Muslim is the greatest aim of any
servant. This entails acknowledging that we are in the hands of

332 © AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

Allah and not in the hands of any servant, confessing the truth
of the Resurrection, and asking to join with the righteous.

An Important Rule: And there is not a thing but
the stores thereof are with Us

Allah, the Exalted says,

كل ‎Sek ot‏ 441:2 جه
« وَإن من شىْء إلا عندنا خزاينهء ...

which means, "And there is not a thing, but with Us are the
stores thereof." (Al-Hijr, 15:21)

This verse is a treasure from among treasures, which
includesevery matter that is to be asked for, as the only One
who has keys of this treasure is Allah and He is the One who
owns the keys. If anyone or anything else is asked, they have
no power or ability to fulfill the request. While the verse, in
which Allah says,

‎gf‏ م ر سدور
« وَأن إإى رَبَكَ المنّى @ 4

‎which means, "And that to your Lord (Allah) is the End (Return
of everything)" (An-Najm, 53:42) includes greater treasure
which is that every aim if it was not for His sake, it is vain and
useless. The end of all matters returns to whoever all matters
end to Him. All matters returns to Allah, His creation, will,
wisdom, and knowledge. He is aim of every need. Every lover
that does not love for His sake, his love would be pain and
suffer, every deed that is not for His sake, is vain and lost, and
every heart that is not full of Him is miserable away from any
happiness and success. Allah shows that all what servant may
want is In His hands by saying what means, "And there is not a
thing, but with Us are the stores thereof." (Al-Hijr, 15:21).

‎Allah revealed that all words and deeds should be performed
for His sake by saying which means, "And that to your Lord

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 3

(Allah) is the End (Return of everything)" (An-Najm, 53:42).
There is no need that we cannot ask from Allah, and the end of
all matters is with Him.

Some Secrets of Monotheism

The heart never becomes straight or calm except by achieving
closeness to Allah. All things should be loved or hated for the
sake of Allah. It is impossible that any matter would end with
two ends or that all creatures were created from two. Whoever
loves, desires, wills, and obeys other than Allah, it would be in
vain and whoever loves, desires, fears, and needs for the sake
of Allah, he would gain His blessings, pleasure, and eternal
happiness. Mankind is always confused between commands
and prohibitions. Man is constantly in need and is obliged to
receive help at times of commands and is in need of kindness
during times of disasters. The kindness that would happen to
him at times of disaster depends upon the way in which he
fulfilled the commands. If he fulfills both the commands in
secret and in public, he would be shown kindness both in
secret and in public. But if he fulfills the commands in public
without fulfilling them secretly within himself, he would be
shown kindness in public, and his share of kindness within
himself would be decreased.

The kindness that one is given within oneself, at times of
disasters is calmness, relief, and not feeling worried,
confused, or discontented. The servant should submit to Allah
in humility seeking Him with all his heart, longing for Him with
his soul, and remain busy by thinking about the kindness He
has bestowed on him more than about his pain. He does not
feel pain as he knows that Allah chooses the best for him and
that he is a mere servant of Allah and under His judgments
whether or not he is content. If he is content, he will feel
contentment and if he is discontented, he will have the
displeasure of Allah. This is kindness, which is the hidden fruit

334 © AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

inside man and is a kind of hidden and secret treatment whose
affect will be either increased or decreased.

A Precious Gem: Loving Allah

The servant can only be close to Allah when his_ will and love
become attached to Him. This is the kind of love that seeks
Him alone and is not covered with any falsehood or insincerity.
It seeks to know His names, attributes, and deeds and its light
would never hide the darkness of neglect, as the light of love
does not cover the darkness of polytheism. The supplications
of the sincere servant seek Allah, so there is no veil of
forgetfulness or negligence to be found between the
Supplicant and Allah. The sincere supplication seeks Allah
and his deeds would be seeking to fulfill His commands and
avoid what He has forbidden. He would perform 36015 of
worship because he was ordered to do so and loves to do them
and avoids what is forbidden because he was forbidden to do
so and so hates them.

This is how deeds are attached to His commands and
prohibitions, which remove all the causes that induce one to
do or avoid the vanities of life. Also trust and love are attached
to Him by placing one’s trust in Allah and being content with
what He has chosen for him. Poverty and need are attached to
Him alone and no other than Him, as well 35 fear, hope,
happiness, and joy.

And if the servant experiences happiness from any creature,
he knows that complete happiness and perfect joy and relief of
the heart are in the hands of Allah. If any creature helps one
to gain closeness to Allah, he will be happy and if that creature
does not, he would be sad. There is no happiness except
through what helps to reach Him and supports to obey Him.
Allah told man that He does not like those who rejoice at this
worldly life and its allurements and ordered man to be glad

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 335

because of His favor and mercy, which is Islam, faith, and the
Qur'an, as the companions and followers explained.

A Valuable Rule: All Blessings are From Allah

The origin of this is to know that all blessings are from Allah
alone: both the blessings of worship and pleasure. You should
seek Him in order to help you in remembering and _ praising
Him. Allah says,

ae
‏ب م‎ pero re ge val oe 2 ot ov) loc 7 ‏ور‎ 00

which means, "And whatever of blessings and good things you
have, it is from Allah. Then, when harm touches you, unto Him
you cry aloud for help." (An-Nahl, 16:53)

And He, the Almighty says,
4 © ‏تفلخونَ‎ SS AAV ett... «

which means, "So remember the graces (bestowed upon you)
from Allah, so that you may be successful." (Al-A'raf, 7:69)

And He, the Almighty says,

which means, “And be grateful for the Graces of Allah, if it is He
Whom you worship." (An-Nahl, 16:114)

As these blessings are from Him and His favor and
remembering and praising them are not gained except through
His permission. Sin is the result of neglecting one’s duty to
Allah and the consequence of Allah leaving His servant to
himself and if He, the Almighty does not remove this from His
servant, he would never be able to remove it himself. The
servant is obliged to ask Allah to remove its cause from him so
that he will not commit it and if it happens he would be obliged

336 ٠ AL-FAWA'ID: A Collection of Wise Sayings

to ask and supplicate Allah to remove its consequences and
punishment. The servant is never satisfied with these three
origins and will never gain success without them: praise,
seeking health, and sincere repentance.

This essence of this subject is desire and fear and it is not in
the hands of the servant but in the hands of Allah, who turns
the hearts according to His will. If Allah granted His servant
success, the servant will seek Him with his heart and fill it with
desire and fear but if Allah leaves His servant, He will leave
him to himself, and will not captivate his heart. Whatever Allah
wishes, will be and whatever He does not wish, will never be.

Granting Success and Incurring Failure

| often wonder whether or not there is a reason for Success and
failure or whether they are just according to will. The truth is
that their reason is based on the level of gratefulness in the
servant. For a servant to be in a suitable situation to accept a
blessing he must know its value, and its potential danger,
praise He who bestowed it on him, glorify Him, and know that
itis a blessing from Allah without having had anything to do
with it nor deserve it. The servant should acknowledge the
oneness of Allah, use this blessing to praise Him, admit that it
is because of His favor, and then he would know his faults and
defects as he knows he could never praise Allah properly. The
servant should know that if Allah continues to grant him this
blessing, it is a favor, charity, and blessing from Him and if He
chooses to take it away from him, he deserves that.

The more Allah grants His servant blessings, the more humility,
submission, praise, and fear of Allah the servant should have
and if it is taken away from him it is because he did not praise
Him as He deserves. The Almighty may take His blessings
away from whoever does not acknowledge or care for them as
they deserve. If the servant does not praise Allah as he should

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 7

and misuses this blessing, undoubtedly Allah will take it away.
Allah says,

wet  F, £ Jw > 738° aoe
&

which means, "Thus We have tried some of them with others,
that they might say: "Is it these (poor believers) that Allah has
favored from amongst us?" Does not Allah know best those
who are grateful?" (Al-An'am, 6:53)

They are those who knew the value of those blessings,
accepted, loved, and praised whoever granted them, and loved
and thanked Him. Allah says,

0 00 5 بي

> وَإِذَا ‎Are‏ ءَايَةٌ قالوأ ‎Geb od‏ حت ‎Be TE‏ ما اوت سل الله

which means, "And when there comes to them a sign (from
Allah) they say: "We shall not believe until we receive the like of
that which the Messengers of Allah had received." Allah knows
best with whom to place His Message." (Al-An'am, 6:124)

Chapter: The Causes of Failure

The cause behind failure is unsuitability of place,
inconvenience, and lacking the ability to accept the blessing; if
he was granted the blessing he would say: this is mine and |
got it because | deserve it as Allah says,

ل ان #رر شح 7 و
« قال ‎Les]‏ أوتيتة, ‎Gre ple Ye‏ ...(2) 4

which means, "He said: "This has been given to me only

That is to say, because of the knowledge that Allah gave me

which means, "This is by the Grace of my Lord to test me

mentioned Qardn and recited,

and that he is afflicted with it and Qarain thought that he
deserved the blessings he received. Also Allah says,

which means, “And truly, if We give him a taste of mercy from
us, after some adversity (severe poverty or disease, etc.) has
touched him, he is sure to say: "This is for me (due to my
merit)." (Fussilat, 41:50)

That is to say, | deserve it and it is mine; | own it.

The believer realizes that all blessings belong to Allah and His
favor and that Allah grants him blessings without him
deserving it. It is continual charity from Him to His servant and
He has the right to deprive anyone from this as He wills. If
Allah prevents people from receiving blessings, He never
prevents them from what they deserve. If the servant fails to
realize that, he might think that he deserves it and would
become conceited thinking that he deserves this blessing and
that he is better than others. As Allah says,

BS of AS Let 0) Yeas Biss ‏نا‎ gol Gil ys»

which means, "And if We give man a taste of Mercy from Us,
and then withdraw it from him, verily! He is despairing,
ungrateful. But if We let him taste good (favor) after evil
(poverty and harm) has touched him, he is sure to say: ‏ا"‎
‎have departed from me." Surely, he is exultant, and boastful
(ungrateful to Allah)." (Hd, 11:9-10)

Allah dispraises such a man because of his despair and being
ungrateful during times of afflictions and because he is happy
and proud when the affliction is removed. He failed to praise
Allah, thank, and glorify Him when He removed the afflictions
but Allah says that he said, "Ills have departed from me." If he
had just said: Allah removes ills away from me by His mercy,
Allah would never dispraise him but the servant forgets Who
bestowed this blessing on him by ascribing it to himself and
through feeling proud.

If Allah, the Exalted sees such a heart in His servant, this ts
one of the greatest causes of failure and letting him down. His
place is not suitable to receive such perfect and complete
blessings as Allah says,

« إن ‎CATH‏ عِند ‎Bf‏ ألصّمُ الْبكمُ ‎Sell‏ يَعْقَلُونَ ‎BD‏ وَلْوَ ‎aif de‏ فِيمّ ‎Vad‏
‎ages! 935 geen‏ لَعَوَلُوا وهم مُعْرَضُوَ 2 4

which means, "Verily! The worst of (moving) living creatures
with Allah are the deaf and the dumb, those who understand
not (i.e. the disbelievers). Had Allah known of any good in them,
He would indeed have made them listen, and even if He had
made them listen, they would but have turned away, averse (to
the truth)." (Al-Anfal, 8:22-23)

Allah said that their place is not suitable to receive His
blessings. Besides this there is another obstacle that prevents
blessings from reaching them, which is their denial and neglect
of what they Know and perceive.

The causes of failure are based on the state of the soul and its
adherence to its nature; the origin of creation. The causes of
success are according to Allah, Who enables the servant to
accept His blessings. The causes of success are from Him and
from His favor and He created both this and that as He created
all the parts of the earth; one part accepts plant life and the
other does not. He created trees; one grows fruit and the other
does not. He created the bee and enabled it to produce honey
with different colors as well as the hornet, which cannot do
that. He created good souls that are able to remember, praise,
thank, glorify, and advise His servants and also created evil
souls who are not able to do that. He is the All Wise and the All-
Knowing. The scholar of Islam Abu Al-'Abbas Ahmad bin

People receive the Messengers of Allah in one of two ways:
either to say: we believe, or refuse to say that and continue to
do evil deeds. Whoever among them says: | believe, Allah will
test him and make him choose in order to expose him as a liar
from the one who is truthful. Whoever refuses to say: | believe,
should not think that he can defeat Allah, for there is no one,
who can do that. This is His way: He sends Messengers to His
creatures and then people accuse them of lying and harm them.
Allah, the Almighty says,

enemies - Shayatin (devils) among mankind and jinns." (Al-

And He, the Almighty says,

which means, "Nothing is said to you )0 Muhammad) except
what was said to the Messengers before you." (Fussilat, 41:43)

Such evil people also harmed and showed enmity toward
anyone who believeds in the Messengers and obeyed them.
They would afflict the believers with pain and if he did not
believe in them, he would be punished and this would be the
cause or more and more pain. No doubt, every soul will suffer
pain whether they are believers or disbelievers. However the

AL-FAWA'ID : A Collection of Wise Syaings * 345

believer suffers pain during this Worldly life, and then he will
gain the reward in the Hereafter, and the disbeliever gets to
enjoy this worldly life but then in the Hereafter he must endure
lasting pain.

The Opinion of Ash-Shafi'y Concerning Affliction and
Being Given Power

A man asked Ash-Shafi'y,” "0 Abu ‘Abdullah! What is better
for man: to be afflicted or to have power?’ Ash-Shafi'y said, 'He
will not be given power until he has been afflicted; Allah
aiflicted Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham), Masa (Moses), ‘Isa
(Jesus), and Muhammad (peace be upon them all) and
because they were patient, Allah bestowed power upon them.
No one should think that he can avoid pain forever."

Whoever Pleases Allah and Displeases People

This is the great origin of power that the wise man should know.
It is human nature that man tries to be civilized. He has to live
with people and people have wills and imagination and demand
him to agree with them in all matters and if he does not agree,
they will harm and torture him and if he agrees with them, he
will be tortured and harmed both by them and by others.

Whoever thinks about his situation and those of other people,
would find several more situations like these. Every nation that
wants to commit adultery, be unjust, and nullify religion, are
guilty of committing some prohibited things that Allah has
mentioned in the following verse,

“He is Muhammad bin Idris bin Al-'Abbas bin ‘Uthman bin Shafi’ Abu
Abdullah. Imam, head of the famous school and one of the four Imams. The
famous among his books are Al-Umm, Ar-Risalah, and others. He (may Allah

p.25, Tarikh Al-Bukhary Al-Kabir, vol.1, p.42, Al-Jarh wat-Ta’‘dil, vol.7, p.1130,

committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous
oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for which He
has given no authority, and saying things about Allah of which
you have no knowledge." (Al-A'raf, 7:33)

‎If such people are gathered in one place for example, in a
university, an inn, a school, a village, or a city that has others
with them, what can they do? What do they want except
approval of the others, or for the others to remain silent and
not to oppose them openly. If the others remained peaceful
they may not be harmed by their evil but they might insult and
punish them to keep them down and in their places. He might
be asked to commit perjury or talk falsely about religion or to
help in committing adultery and unjust deeds. If he refuses,
they will harm him and show enmity to him and if he answered
them they themselves will rule, harm, and insult him many times
as much as they used to fear him before or he will be tortured.
What should be done is what is mentioned in the hadith that
was narrated by 'A'ishah, which she sent to Mu'awiyah. It was
narrated as Mawaqtf (discontinued) and Marfd' (traceable),
"Whoever pleases Allah through displeasing people, Allah will
save him from asking people."’’ And in another narration, "Allah
will be pleased with him and will make people pleased with him
and whoever pleases people by displeasing Allah, they will
never save him from Allah." And in another narration, “Whoever
praises him from among people will dispraise him."

This applies to whoever supports kings and leaders with their
evil aims and whoever supports the people of innovations in
their novelties who are supposed to belong to the people of
knowledge and religion. Whoever Allah guides and shows him
the way, he will never commit prohibited acts and will bear
their harm and enmity and then he will receive the reward for
his efforts in the Hereafter. As it happened to the Messengers
and their followers with those who harmed them and showed
them enmity, like the emigrants of this nation and the
scientists, worshipers, merchants, and Supporters, who were
afflicted.

Affliction is Inevitable

On certain occasions, it is lawful to show approval and hide
one’s denial like in the case of he who is forced to Say words
of disbelief. What is meant here is that it is inevitable that
everyone will face affliction and harm. There is no way to be
saved from affliction. That is why Allah, the Exalted mentioned
this point in several places Saying that people have to be
afflicted and that affliction can be by means of happiness and
misfortune. Man_ will be afflicted with what pleases and harms
him, so he needs to be patient and praise Allah.

And in the divine hadith, Abu Dharr (may Allah be pleased with

Sayyid Al-istighfar

lt was mentioned in the authentic hadith that is the hadith of
Sayyid Al-Istighfar (The best supplication for asking
forgiveness), that the servant should say, "Allahumma Anta

upon me and | acknowledge my sins. | beseech You to forgive

during the day with firm faith in it, and dies on the same day
before the evening, he will be from the people of Paradise; and
if somebody recites it at night with firm faith in it, and dies
before the morning, he will be from the people of Paradise."

And it was narrated by Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with
him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) taught
him what to recite during the day and the night and when he is
about to sleep, “Allahumma Fatir is-samawat wal-ard, ‘alimi al-

sermon, “Al-Hamdu lillahi, nasta'inahu wa nastaghfirahu wa

of faith, discourage you from conveying Allah's Message (which
you are obliged to convey). (Ar-Rum, 30:60)

It is said that he who is stable and whose belief is stable will
have true belief and faith within his heart both through deeds
and knowledge. The knowledge of a servant may be good but
his soul cannot be patient during times of hardship, so he goes
astray.

The Origin of Anger

Al-Hasan Al-Basry said: if you want to see a man, who has
insight without being patient, you will find such a man, but if
you see one, who has insight and is patient, this is the good
one. Allah, the Almighty says,

‎which means, "And We made from among them (Children of
Israel), leaders, giving guidance under Our Command, when
they were patient and used to believe with certainty in Our Ayat
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)."
(As-Sajdah, 32:24)

‎That is why the soul is compared to fire in the speed it moves
and in how it spoils what is around it. The soul takes anger and
desire from the fire and Satan is created from fire.

‎The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Anger is from Satan,
Satan is created from fire and fire can be put out with water. If
anyone among you gets angry he should perform ablution."*’
And in another hadith he said, "Anger is a firebrand that is to be
lit inside the son of Adam." Can’t you see the red of his eyes
and the swelling of his cheeks? They are caused by the blood,
which is boiling inside his heart, seeking revenge. And it was

recorded by Al-Bukhary and Muslim that the Prophet (peace be
upon him) said, "Satan reaches every place in the human body
that blood reaches. (everywhere in one's body)."®8

And it was recorded in the two sahih that two men abused each
other in front of the Prophet and one of them became angry and
his anger became so intense that his face became swollen and
changed. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Il know a
word the saying of which will cause him to relax if he Says it. If
he says, 'l seek refuge with Allah from Satan."®? And Allah Says,

Allah ordered the faithful believers to be patient at the time of
anger, and to excuse those who treat them badly), then verily!
He, between whom and you there was enmity, (will become) as
though he was a close friend. But none is granted it (the above
quality) except those who are patient, and none is granted it
except the owner of the great portion (of the happiness in the
Hereafter i.e. Paradise and in this world of a high moral
character). And if an evil whisper from Shaitan (Satan) tries to

then seek refuge in Allah. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-
