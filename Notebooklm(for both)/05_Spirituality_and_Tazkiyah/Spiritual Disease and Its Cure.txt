Shaikh, Imam and Scholar, Shams-Deen Abu Abdullah
Muhammad bin Shaikh Salih Abu Bakr, known as Ibn AJQayyim Al-Jawziyyah, may Allah be pleased with him, was
asked:
"What is the opinion of the scholars, may Allah be pleased
with them, regarding a man who is afflicted by a disease, and
knows that if it should continue, it would damage his life?
What is the way to stop this kind of suffering, knowing that
the afflicted man has taken all the necessary measures to
bring it to an end, yet the pain only increases?
What is the best way to treat this?
May Allah bless anyone who helps a stricken person, as
Allah helps His Servant as long as the Servant helps his
brother.
Please give us the legal Islamic opinion on this matter, and
may Allah ~ reward you, accordingly."
Shaikh Abu Al-Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah, may Allah bless him,
replied saying:
"All Praise to Allah~. It was confirmed in the Sahih book
of Al-Bukhari, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah 4'k, that the
Prophet :i said: "Allah ~ has appointed a remedy for every
disease He ~ has sent down"1, and in the Sahih book of
Muslim, on the authority of Jabir bin Abdullah 4'k, that the
Prophet :i said: "There is a remedy for every malady, and

when the remedy is applied to the disease it is cured with the
Permission of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious."'
Imam Ahmad reported, on the authority of Usamah bin
Shareek, that the Prophet :i said: "Allah has not made a
disease without providing a remedy for it, with the exception
of one disease, namely old age." 2
This applies to medicines for the heart, soul and body. The
Prophet :i considered ignorance to be a disease; its medicine
is asking scholars.
Abu Dawud reported in his Sunan, on the authority of Jabir
bin Abdullah 4lb who said: "During a journey, a man among
us was hit by a stone, which wounded his head, and he had a
wet dream that night. He asked his companions: 'Can you
give permission for me to apply tayammum (in my
condition)?' They replied: 'We cannot find any permission
for you, as you may still apply water.' So the man used
water to bathe himself, and died. When we came to the
Prophet :i, we informed him, and he :i said: 'They have
killed him, may Allah kill them! Why did they not ask when
they did not know? The remedy of ignorance is to ask for the
answer. It was enough for him to make tayammum, and
wrap a damp cloth on his wound, and then clean the rest of
his body."3

Allah~ has informed us that the Qur'an is a healing, when
He~ said: (If We had sent this as a Qur'an in a foreign
language (other than Arabic), they would have said:
"Why are not its Verses explained in detail (in our
language)? What! (A Book) not in Arabic and (the
Messenger) an Arab?" Say: "It is for those who believe, a
guide and a healing.) 1 and He £ also said: (We sent down
of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy to
those who believe)1; the whole of the Qur'an is a healing; it
is a healing for hearts from ignorance, doubt and uncertainty.
Allah ~ has not sent down a more comprehensive and
beneficial medicine to remove any ailment than the Qur'an.
It was reported in the Sahih book of Al-Bukhari, on the
authority of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri ~ who said: "A group of
the companions of the Messenger of Allah proceeded on a
journey till they dismounted near one of the Arab tribes and
requested them to entertain them as their guests, but they
(the tribe people) refused to entertain them. Then the chief of
that tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and
he was given all sorts of treatment, but all in vain. Some of
them said: 'Will you go to the group (those travellers) who
have dismounted near you and see if one of them has
something useful?' They came to them and said: 'O group!
Our leader has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a
scorpion) and we have treated him with everything, but
nothing has benefited him. Has anyone of you anything
useful?' One of them replied: 'Yes, by Allah, I know how to
treat it with a Ruqya. But, by Allah, we wanted you to
receive us as your guests but you refused. I will not treat

your patient with a Ruqya till you fix for us something a
wage.' Consequently, they agreed to give those travellers a
flock of sheep. The man went with them (the people of the
tribe) and started spitting (on the bite) and reciting Surat-alFatihah till the patient was healed and started walking as if
he had never been sick. When the tribe people paid them
their wages that they had agreed upon, some of them (the
Prophet's Companions) said: 'Distribute (the sheep).' But
the one who treated with the Ruqya said: 'Do not do that till
we have gone to the Messenger of Allah and told him what
has happened, and then see what he will order us to do.' So
they approached the Messenger of Allah and mentioned the
story to him, to which he said: 'How do you know that Surat
Al-Fatihah is a Ruqya? You have done the right thing!
Divide (what you have got) and assign for me a share with
you. "' 2
If a person uses the healing with Al-Fatihah perfectly, he
would see some great effects in the process of healing.

I stayed in Makkah for a period where I was stricken with
some diseases, but was unable to find a doctor or a handy
medicine, so I was simply treating myself with Al-Fatihah,
and witnessed some astonishing effects. I offered this
treatment to anyone who suffered any pain, and most of
them were cured within a short period of time.

However, one should understand that the supplications and
the Verses which are used for the healing process require
that the person should have belief and readiness to be cured
by this treatment, in order for it to have a greater effect upon
him/her. In fact, if healing is not achieved, it could have
been due to the weak effect of the medicine, the nonreadiness of the afflicted one, or to a powerful preventive
factor which hindered the treatment by material medicines.
Such lack of effect could also be the result of a natural
negative reaction towards the medicine; indeed, if one's
body wholly accepts the medicine, it would benefit
accordingly; and likewise if the heart accepts healing by the
Qur'an and supplications, in a comprehensive manner, the
person who performing this treatment would more
effectively be able to remove the ailment (with Allah's
Permission).
Supplication is one of the most powerful tools for driving
away evil, and obtaining that which is needed; however, its
effect may be absent if there is weakness in the self - such
that the supplication could be disliked by Allah ~ ; if it
includes any injustice, or due to the weakness of one's heart,
not being devoted to Allah ~ at the time of supplication.
Hindrance may also be due to eating that which is Haram
(unlawful in Islam) or to the accumulation of sins on the
heart, or to the dominance of one's desires upon the self.
The Prophet ~ said: "Supplicate to Allah when you are
assured of being answered, and know that Allah does not
answer a supplication which comes from a careless and
inattentive heart." 1
I

Recorded by At-Tirmidhi in the "Book of Supplications", (chapter 65)
and Ahmad in his Musnad (3/451 ).

One should know that Allah does not accept the supplication
coming from a distracted heart. The supplication is a good
and beneficial cure for one's ailment, but indifference or
carelessness of the heart, from Allah ~ . cancels its effect,
just as weakness is caused by the consummation of Haram
things. Abu Hurayrah ~ reported that the Prophet~ said:
"O people, Allah is Good and He, therefore, accepts only
that which is good. And Allah commanded the believers as
He commanded the Messengers by saying: ( 0 Messengers,
eat of the good things, and do good deeds; verily I am
aware of what you do) (Al-Mu'minun: 51) And He ~ said:
( 0 those who believe, eat of the good things that We gave
you) (Al-Baqarah: 172)." He ~ then made a mention of a
person who travels widely, his hair dishevelled and covered
with dust. He lifts his hand towards the sky (and thus makes
the supplication): "O Lord, 0 Lord," whereas his diet is
unlawful, his drink is unlawful, and his clothes are unlawful,
and his nourishment is unlawful. How then could his
supplication be accepted?"2
Abdullah bin Imam Ahmad reported in the book, Zuhd,
about his father: "The Children of Israel suffered an
affliction, so Allah ~ revealed to their Prophet to inform
them: 'You go out to the desert in your filthy bodies, and
you invoke my blessings, raising your hands, with which you
have killed people and brought unlawful goods into your
houses. Now that My Punishment has increased upon you,
you will just stay more distant from Me."'

Supplication

Supplication is one of the most beneficial cures. It is the
enemy of affliction, challenging and treating it, by
preventing it from occurring; it removes it or weakens it if it
falls upon a believer. It is the weapon of every believer, as
reported by Al-Hakim in his Sahih book, on the authority of
Ali bin Abi Talib ~ that the Prophet ~ said: "Supplication is
the weapon of a believer; it is the pillar of Islam, and the
light of the heavens and earth."
There are three situations in relation to this affliction or trial:
First, when it is more powerful than the affliction so it drives
it away.
Second, when it is weaker than the affliction, however it
reduces its effect.
Third, when they resist each other and so each one prevents
the other from being effective.
Abu Khizamah said: "I said: 'O Messenger of Allah, do the
incantations that we invoke, the medicine that we apply, and
the preventative measures that we observe avert, in any way,
the Decree of Allah?' He~ replied: 'That is also a part of the
Decree of Allah (al-Qadr)' ." 1
Thawban ~ also reported that the Prophet ~ said: "Only
supplication averts the decree, only kindness prolongs life,
and a man is deprived of provision for a fault he commits."2

Supplicating earnestly
This is one of the most beneficial medicines.
Ibn Maajah reported in his Sunan, on the authority of Abu
Hurayrah ~ who said: "The Messenger of Allah ~ said: 'He
who does not ask Allah, earns His Anger." 3
Al-Hakim reported in his Sahih book, on the authority of
Anas ~ that the Prophet ~ said: "Do not under-estimate
supplication, for no one perishes with it."
Al-Awza'i reported from az-Zuhari, from 'Urwah, from
Aishah ,$, who said: "The Messenger of Allah ~ said: 'Allah
~ loves those who persist in supplicating to Him."
In the book, Zuhd, by Imam Ahmad, on the authority of Abu
Qatadah who said: "Muwariq said: 'I could not find a better
example of a believer but that of a man clinging to a piece of
wood at sea, praying: 'O Lord ... 0 Lord ... ' asking Allah ~
to save him."

Impediments which prevent the beneficial effects of
supplication
Among the impediments which prevent the effect of
supplication from taking place are:
The feeling of hastiness in a person who considers the
supplication to be slow to take effect, so he becomes
distressed and abandons it. Such person is like one who
plants some seeds and looks after them by watering them
regularly, but if they grow slowly, he ignores them.

Recorded by At-Tirmidhi in the "Book of Supplications", (chapter 24)
and Ahmad in his Musnad (2/442).

12

Abu Hurayrah ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said:
"Everyone's supplication will be answered, as long as one is
not hasty, and says: 'I made my supplication but it was not
answered."' 1
The Prophet ~ also said: "Whenever a Muslim supplicates to
Allah, Allah grants him his supplication or averts some kind
of evil from him, so long as he does not supplicate for
something sinful or something that would cut off the ties of
kinship." Thereupon someone said: "Then we shall
supplicate plenty." The Prophet :i said: "Allah is more
plentiful in responding. " 2
Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri ~ said: "The Messenger of Allah ~
said: 'Any Muslim who makes a supplication, containing
nothing which is sinful or which involves breaking ties of
relationship, will be receive one of three things by Allah: He
will give him a swift answer, or store it up for him in the
next world, or remove from him an equivalent amount of
evil.' Those who heard it said they would then make many
supplications, so he :i replied that Allah 'M was more ready
to answer than they were to ask. " 3

Presence of the heart at the time of supplication
One's presence of heart should accompany a supplication for
any request, and it is also more effective if it coincides with
one of the six "times of reply" (times when a supplication is
more likely to be responded to): the last third of the night,

during the Adhan (Call to Salaah), between the Adhan and
Iqamah, before the prescribed Salaah, when the Imam stands
on the Minbar (pulpit) on Friday until the termination of
Salaah on that day, and the last hour after 'Asr (afternoon
Salaah). One should fear Allah inside one's heart, with total
submission to Him~. facing the Qiblah4 in a state of purity
(after having performed ablution). Then one should raise
one's hands to the Lord, starting by praising Him, invoking
His Mercy upon Prophet Muhammad :!i, requesting His
Forgiveness and the acceptance of one's repentance. Then,
this is followed by relentlessly asking the Lord to help you in
a particular matter, remembering Him by all His Names and
Attributes, and affirming one's firm belief in Islamic
Monotheism; namely those supplications which include the
Great Name of Allah ~- Such was mentioned in the Hadith
of Abdullah bin Buraydah, on the authority of his father,
who said that the Prophet ~ heard a man saying: "O Allah, I
ask You that I testify that You are Allah and there is no god
but You, the One, the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all
creatures need, Who begets not, nor was he begotten, and
there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him," to which he
~ replied: "He has asked Allah with the Name, which if used
to ask Allah for something, He ~ gives, and if used to
supplicate Allah for something, He ~ responds". In another
narration, the Prophet ~ was reported as saying: "You have
asked Allah~ with His Great Name." 5

There is in the Musnad of Imam Ahmad and the Sahih book
of Al-Hakim, a Hadith reported by Abu Hurayrah, Anas bin
Malik and Rabee'ah bin 'Amir :$>, that the Prophet ~ said:
"observe supplicating to Allah ~ with the expression: DhalJalal wal-Ikram (Owner of Majesty and Honour)"3 ,
meaning: adhere to this, supplicating to Allah constantly,
using this expression.
At-Tirmidhi also recorded a Hadith of Abu Hurayrah 4, that
when the Prophet ~ was concerned about a particular matter,
he would raise his hands to the sky, and if he persisted in his
supplication, he would say: "Ya Hayy, Ya Qayyum!" (The
Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that
exists).
Anas bin Malik 4, also said: "When the Prophet ~ was
anxious about a particular matter, he ~ would say: 'Ya Hayy,
Ya Qayyum, with Your Mercy I seek Your Help."

that it is (Al-Hayy, Al-Qayyum)."
Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas ~ was recorded, in the Sunan of AtTirmidhi and the Sahih book of Al-Hakim, as reporting that
the Prophet ~ said: "(As for) The Supplication of Dhun-Nun
(Jonah), when he invoked Allah ~ through the darkness,
inside the big fish: (None has the right to be worshipped
but You (0 Allah), Glorified are You! Truly, I have been
of the wrongdoers) no Muslim invoked Allah ~ with this
Supplication except that Allah ~ responds to him',4. AtTirmidhi said: "This Hadith is authentic."
In another narration recorded by Al-Hakim in Al-Mustadrak,
Sa'd bin Abi Waqqas ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said:
"Shall I inform you of a supplication that if anyone among
you is in trouble should invoke Allah ~ with it? It is the
supplication of Dhun-Nun (Jonah)."
Sa'id also reported that the Prophet ~ said: "Shall I guide
you to the Greatest Name of Allah ~ ? The supplication of
Dhun-Nun. A man said: 'O Messenger of Allah, was there
an exception for Dhun-Nun? He ~ said: "Don't you hear
Allah ~ saying ( So We answered his call, and delivered
him from the distress, and thus We do deliver the
believers) 5, therefore, if any stricken Muslim uses this
supplication forty times during his sickness but (then) died
(in his illness) he would be given the reward of a martyr, yet
if he should be cured, his sins would be forgiven."

Ibn 'Abbas ~ reported that the Prophet ~ used to say, in
times of trouble: "There is no god but Allah, the Mighty, and
the Most Forbearing. There is no god but the Lord of the
Mighty Throne. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the
Seven Heavens, the Lord of the Earth, and the Lord of the
Mighty Throne."
In the Musnad of Imam Ahmad, Ali bin Abi Talib ~ said:
"The Messenger of Allah ~ taught me to say, in times of
distress: 'There is no god but Allah, the Most Forbearing, the
Most Generous. Glorified is Allah, the Lord of the Mighty
Throne. All Praise to Allah, the Lord of 'Alamin (mankind,
Jinn and all that exists)." 1
Abdullah bin Mas 'ud ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said:
"When a person is in distress, and says: 'O Allah, I am Your
Servant, son of Your Servant, son of Your Maidservant, my
forelock is in Your Hand, Your Command over me is forever
executed and Your Decree over me is just. I ask You, by
every name belonging to You with which You named
Yourself, or revealed in Your Book, or You taught to any of
Your creation, or you have preserved in the knowledge of the
Unseen with You, that You make the Qur'an the life of my
heart, the light of my breast, an end to my sorrow(s), and a
release for my anxiety', Allah ~ will release him from all his
worries, and replace them with happiness, instead." They
replied: 'Shall we learn them?' He ~ said: 'Everyone who
hears this should learn it. ' 2

Ibn Mas'ud said: "No prophet endured a distress except that
he sought the Help of Allah, by glorifying him (with
tasbeeh)."
The connection of stress with supplication
Often, we may find that certain supplications used by some
people, may be answered. These supplications were usually
made at times of stress or plight which lead a person to tum
to Allah with sincerity; or in connection with a past good
deed which Allah ~ accepted and then thanked him for by
answering his supplication; or if it coincided with a time of
response to supplications. The person would think that the
secret behind the answer to his supplication (from Allah ~)
is simply the utterance of that supplication, without relating
it to those issues which might have been connected to it.
Supplicating and seeking refuge with Allah ~ is like a
(defensive) weapon
If a weapon is complete, the effect would be powerful, and
there would be no obstacle ahead of one, so the destruction
of the enemy could be accomplished. However, if one of
those aspects was missing, then the weapon would be less
effective.
If the supplication is not practical itself, or if the person

making the supplication has not linked his heart to his
tongue, or if an impediment blocks the response (of Allah ~)
to the supplication, then no effect would be seen to occur.
Supplication and the delay of causes of effect
There is a popular question about supplication, which is
related to fate and destiny: "It is likely that a request in a
supplication may already have been preordained not to take

18

place, whether a person makes the supplication or not, and if
it had not been preordained at all, it would not take place
anyway"
Those who thought that this statement was valid, would
abstain from making supplication, saying that it is of no use!
Those people who believe in this statement are contradicting
themselves, because their belief suggests the cancelling of all
causes of effect. We tell them:
"If satiation and quenching were preordained for you, then it
would be necessary that they should take place, whether you
eat or not. However, if they were not preordained, then they
could not take place whether you eat or not.
If it was preordained for you to have a baby, then you would
definitely have a baby, whether you should have sexual
intercourse with your wife or not, and if it was not
preordained for you to have a baby, it would never take
place, therefore, it is not necessary to get married; and so on.
But could this be accepted by any reasonable human being?
Even an animal naturally relates to the causes of effects,
which are the basis of its life. Animals are more reasonable
than these people ... "

But smart people say: "Observing supplication is pure
worship, which attracts the reward of Allah ~' without any
effect on the things requested in the supplication!"
Another even smarter group say: "Supplication is but a sign
which Allah ~ has given to focus on the need of
accomplishing something. When Allah ~ helps His Servant

19

to make a supplication, then it is a sign that the Servant's
particular need has come to an end."

It is like when one sees dark clouds in the sky; they are a
sign that rain may be coming. It has also been said that this
is the same as the judgment of obedient acts by their reward,
and the judgment of disbelief and disobedient acts with their
punishment. They are simply signs of the occurrence of
reward or punishment, and they are not causes of the effects.
They believe that it is a mere relation with no effect, and
therefore, they have contradicted Islam, reason and the first
natural order of existence.
The answer to this question is that the decree was already
preordained with its causes, and the supplication was one of
these causes that was also preordained and free of any
further cause.
Whenever a person comes with the cause, the decree will
take place. And when a person does not come with the
cause, the decree will not occur. Thus, satiation and
quenching was predestined together with eating and
drinking; having a baby was predestined along with having
sexual intercourse; reaping a harvest with farming; taking
away the life of an animal with slaughtering it; and likewise,
entering Paradise was preordained with doing good deeds,
while entering the Hell-Fire was with doing bad deeds.
Therefore, supplication is one of the most effective causes.
The Companions of the Prophet ~, who were the most
learned people in the Islamic Ummah, were rightly guided to
use this cause in the right manner.

20

'Umar bin Al-Khattab ~ used supplication to seek help from
Allah ~ so as to be victorious over his enemy; it was his
greatest weapon. He 4, used to say to his companions: "You
are not supported for victory with your big number; rather
you are supported from the heavens." He used to say: "I do
not worry too much about the reply to my supplication. I am
only concerned about the supplication itself.
If your
supplication is sincere, the answer will come with it."
Whoever is inspired to make a supplication, would receive a
reply for his/her need; for Allah ~ said: ( Ask me for
anything, I will respond to your invocation) 1 and ( When
My Servants ask you concerning Me, then, I am indeed
near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the
invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me) 2
Abu Hurayrah ~ reported that the Messenger of Allah :I
said: "He who does not ask Allah will earn the anger of
Allah", which shows that pleasing Allah ~ lies in both
asking Him and obeying him. All good comes from pleasing
the Lord, and all hardships and torments come from
displeasing Him £.
Imam Ahmad reported, in his book, "Zuhd', a Hadith Qudsi
in which Allah ~ said: "I am Allah. There is no god but Me.
If I am pleased, I bestow My Grace upon My Servant, and
there is no limit to My Blessings. If I am Angry, I Curse,
and My Curse reaches the seventh offspring of a person."

Texts (from the Qur'an and the Sunnah), man's intellect and
fitrah (primal nature), and the experiences of nations despite the diversity of their races and religions - have all
proved that seeking the pleasure of the Lord, and being good
and dutiful to His Creation is one of the greatest causes of
goodness, while its opposite is one of the greatest causes of
evil.
Allah ~ has determined in His Book (the Qur'an) that the
attainment of goodness or evil in this world and the
Hereafter, is based upon the nature of one's deeds. It is
organised such that the manner a reward is linked to its
cause. This arrangement is mentioned in more than a
thousand Qur'anic verses; indeed, Islamic judgment is based
upon a proper description of this, as in the following Verses:
( So when they exceeded the limits of what they were
prohibited, We said to them: "Be you monkeys, despised
and rejected) 1
( So when they angered Us, We punished them, and
drowned them a11) 2
( As for the male thief and the female thief, cut off their
hands as a recompense for that which they committed) 3
( Verily, Muslim men and women, believing men and
women, obedient men and women, truthful men and
women, the men and women who are patient, men and
women who are humble, men and women who give

sadaqat (charity), men and women who observe fasting,
men and women who guard their chastity, and men and
women who remember Allah much with their hearts and
tongues; Allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a
great reward) 4
In other Verses Allah ~. Islamic judgment is shaped both by
a condition and a recompense, as in the following Verses:
( If you obey and fear Allah, He will grant you furqan (a

criterion to judge between right and wrong) and will
expiate for you your sins, and forgive you) 5
( But if they repent and perform Sa/at and give Zakat,
then they are your brethren in religion) 6
( If they had believed in Allah, and gone on the Right

Way, We would surely have bestowed on them water in
abundance) 7
Overall, the whole Qur'an, from its beginning to its end,
clearly explains the notion of recompense for good and evil,
and Islamic judgments and commands according to their
causes. In fact, all judgments, in this world and the
Hereafter; their benefits and their cause of corruptions, are
based upon deeds and causes.
Whoever understands and perceives this issue would
certainly benefit well in his/her life, and would not rely on
destiny, with ignorance or negligence.

A divine pre-ordainment is stopped by another divine preordainment, and man cannot escape this fact. Indeed,
hunger, thirst and cold and all the other types of worries are
part of destiny, yet people endeavour to stop this destiny
with other aspects of destiny. And so, whoever is supported
and inspired by Allah ~ would be able to stop the fate of the
punishment in the Hereafter with the divine fore-ordainment
of repentance, pure belief and good deeds, which is in
conformity with our destiny in this world; because the Lord
of the Hereafter and this world is One, and His Wisdom is
One, and so none contradicts the other. This represents one
of the noblest issues for a person who acknowledges its
value and considers it properly.
Nevertheless, there remain two issues which one needs m
order to achieve both happiness and success:
First, to know about good and evil, and to have an insight
into events taking place in the world; through one's own
experiences, news, and the history of ancient and modem
nations.

The most beneficial way to do is to ponder on the different
meanings of the Qur'an; for it provides such benefit in the
most perfect way.
The Verses of the Qur' an contain all the causes of good and
evil, in clear detail. There is also the Sunnah of the Prophet
~' which follows the Qur'an and is regarded as the second
source of Divine Revelation. Whoever focuses on these
alone would find it quite sufficient enough (without checking
other sources). They show one good and evil and their
sources.

24

When you contemplate the nations' news and the divine
decrees for both people who obey Allah ~ and disobey Him,
you would realise that it conforms to what you have learnt in
the Qur'an and the Sunnah , in every detail of what Allah ~
had already informed and promised us about. You would
come to learn from the Signs of Allah ~ that the Qur' an is
true, the Messenger (Muhammad :i) is true, and that Allah ~
in all ways fulfils His Promise. The study of history shows
details of the reasons behind good and evil, about which
Allah ~ and His Prophet :i have made this clear for us to
understand.
Second, to be cautious not to deceive oneself about these
causes, which is one of the most important. In fact, a person
may know that a misdeed (and carelessness) is one of the
most harmful causes in this world and the Hereafter, but one
may be misled by relying upon the Mercy and Forgiveness
of Allah ~ . or by declaring repentance with one's tongue
only, or by arguing that these causes are divine foreordainment which human beings cannot challenge or change.
Many people believe that whatever sin they commit, it would
be removed just by saying: "I seek forgiveness from Allah
~ ".
A man who was concerned with Fiqh (Islamic
jurisprudence) said to me: "I do whatever I do, then I say
'Subhanallah wabi-hamdih' a hundred times, and everything
is forgiven, for it was authentically reported that the Prophet
~ said: "Whoever said in a day: 'Subhanallah wabi-hamdih'
a hundred times, all his sins will be wiped, even if they were
as much as meerschaum (sea-foam)." 1
I

Recorded by Muslim in the "Book of Invoking Allah", (Hadith 28), AlBukhari in the "Book of Supplications", (chapter 65), Abu Dawud in the
"Book of Tasbeeh", (chapter 24), At-Tirmidhi in the book, "Al-Witr"
(chapter 15), and Ahmad in his Musnad (2/ 158, 210).

25

A man from Makk.ah said to me: "When one ofus commits a
sin, he would wash and do circumambulation around the
Ka'bah for a week, and all his sins would be wiped out."
Another man said: "It was authentically reported that the
Prophet ;i said: "A man committed a sin and said: 'O Lord, I
have committed a sin. Forgive me.' So Allah ~ forgave
him. Then he stood (without committing anything wrong) as
Allah wanted, and he again committed another sin. He said:
'O Lord, I have committed a sin. Forgive me.' So Allah~
forgave him. Allah~ said: 'My slave knows that he has a
Lord who forgives sins and also punishes for them, so I
forgive My slave, and he may do whatever he wants." 1 The
man said: "And I have no doubt that I have a Lord, Who
forgives a sin and also punishes for it". These type of people
have attached themselves to words of hope, and relied on
them. When they are reprimanded for indulging in sins and
misdeeds, they start quoting everything that they have learnt
concerning the Vast Mercy of Allah~ and His Forgiveness.
These type of people have uttered some strange statements,
such as:
"Seeking infallibility (from sins) shows ignorance of the
Vast Mercy of Allah."
"Abstaining from sins is disrespectful and shows insolence
towards the Mercy of Allah."

I

Recorded by Al-Bukhari in the "Book of Tawheed", (chapter35), and
Ahmad in his Musnad (2/ 296, 405, 493).

26

Muhammad bin Hazm said: "I have witnessed some of those
saying in supplication: 'O Allah, I seek refuge in You from
infallibility."
Some people are deceived by their adherence to the doctrine
of Jahr (predestination and the inescapability of fate); they
are fatalists. They claim that man has no control over his
actions and has no free will.
He is therefore under
compulsion to commit sins.
Some of them are deceived by the notion of Irja ', a doctrine
which defines faith as a state of belief in the heart, without
any importance in one's actions (religious obligations). The
true definition of Faith is defined by "Ahlu Sunnah walJama 'ah" as: the testimony of faith declared by the tongue,
the belief in the heart, and actions by the limbs (i.e. one
testifies that there is no god worthy of worship but Allah,
and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, believing in
this testimony with his heart, and manifesting this belief in
actions, by performing Salah, giving Zakat and Sadaqah,
fasting Ramadan, performing Hajj if one is able, etc)
The Murji'ah (those who adopt the doctrine of Jrja') claim
that only the testimony of faith is enough to enter Paradise,
and so they consider that the faith of the most corrupted
person is like the faith of the angels, Jibreel (Gabriel) and
Michael ~\.
Some people are deceived by their love for the poor, the
scholars and pious people. They often visit their graves,
seeking their intercession, asking Allah ~ for their rights
over them ...

27

Some people are deceived into believing that their fathers
and ancestors have a special, elevated status in Allah's Sight,
and that they could help in securing Allah' s Mercy for them.
This is witnessed in royal circles, where the closest people to
the king/queen always intervene to seek mercy for their
relatives, if they were involved in any bad incidents.
Some people are deceived by considering the idea that Allah
~· s Punishment would not add anything to His Sovereignty,
and His Mercy would not reduce anything from His
Kingship. So, these type of people say: I am in need of
Allah's Mercy, and Allah ~ is the Richest of all. If any
destitute person were in need of drinking water from a well,
the owner of the well would not deny him so, and Allah ~ is
the Most Generous of all His Creation. His Forgiveness
would not decrease His sovereignty, while His Punishment
would not add anything to it.
Some people are deceived by their corrupt understanding of
some Verses in the Qur' an. They rely on the Mercy of Allah
~. while wrongly interpreting the Verse: ( Verily, Allah
forgives all sins) '. Certainly, polytheism is the basis of all
sins, and there is no argument that this Verse is directed to
the repentant; for Allah ~ forgives the sin of any person who
repents from that sin. If the Verse were directed to the nonrepentant then all the texts declaring the punishment for
sinners would become abrogated. This is due to the lack of
knowledge of these people, for Allah ~ has used a general
expression which conveys that He ~ meant repentant
people.

I

Surat az-Zumar, Verse 93.

28

In Surah an-Nisa', He ~ restricted the meaning by saying:
(Verily Allah forgives not that partners should be set up
with Him (in worship), but He forgives, except for that,
whom He wills.) 2 So Allah ~ informed that He ~ does not
forgive associating partners besides Him, but forgives
anything else.
Some people are deceived by their wrong interpretation of
the Verse: (0 man! What has deluded you in respect of
your Noble Lord) 3 . They say that Allah~ may grant the
argument a deceived person; which is pure ignorance of the
meaning of the Qur'an. This Verse considers how man
could be deceived by the deceiver (i.e. the Satan) and by the
self, which always commands evil.
Some people are deceived by their intention for fasting the
day of Ashura (the tenth day of Muharram) or the day of
Ara/ah (the ninth of Dhul-Hijjah). Some of them say:
fasting the day of Ashura expiates for all sins of the year,
while fasting the day of Ara/ah is an additional
compensation. Such deceived people do not know that
performing the five prescribed prayers and fasting the month
of Ramadan is greater in compensation than fasting the day
of Ara/ah and the day of Ashura. Fasting the last two days
expiates the minor sins committed in between, if major sins
have already been avoided.
Fasting the month of Ramadan with good faith can expiate
minor sins, only if one avoids committing any major sin.
Therefore, how could fasting one voluntary day (Ashura)
2
3

Surat an-Nisa', Verse 48.
Surat AI-Infitar, Verse 2.

29

expiate for all major sins, committed by a person who did
not repent for them? This is undoubtedly impossible, for
Allah ~ said: (If you avoid the great sins which you are
forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small)
. )4
SIDS .
Some people rely on the Hadith of the Prophet ~ who
reported that Allah ~ said: "I am as My Servant thinks good
of Me. So he may think of Me whatever he likes." 5
This means that whatever was in his thought, Allah would do
that to him/her. There is no doubt that good opinion relates
to Ihsan (perfection in worshipping Allah :m), for the Muhsin
(the one who exerts perfection in his worship of Allah) has a
good opinion of his Lord and believes that He would
compensate him for his trying to perfect his worship, and
therefore accept his repentance. As for the wrongdoer, who
persists in committing sins and infractions, his loneliness in
the world of sins and unlawfulness denies him of having a
good opinion of His Lord. Al-Hasan Al-Basri ~ said: "A
believer has a good opinion of His Lord, so he perfects his
work. A wrongdoer has a poor opinion of his Lord, so he
goes about his work in an evil manner."
Those who have a poor opinion of their Lord are distant
from Hirn £; they are under His Curse, for they think little
of His Commands and Prohibitions.

30

How could such people have good opinion of their Lord
when they have shown enmity to His Supporters (the
supporters of Allah) and allied with His Enemies?
They deny Allah's Attributes (claiming that He ~ does not
talk, command, forbid, etc) which He ~ has already affirmed
to Himself. He ~ said about them: (That thought of yours

which you thought about your Lord, has brought you to
destruction; and you have become of those utterly lost) 1;
their thinking that Allah ~ does not know much about their
deeds is their poor opinion of Him ~. which would lead to
their destruction.
This is the fate of everyone who denies Allah's Attributes,
but describes Him in a different way from what He ~ has
described Himself.
Reflect on this situation and one's firm need for Allah ~ :
How could it be that a person's heart is certain of his
meeting with His Lord, and that Allah ~ hears his words,
sees where he is, and knows his secrets, and that he will
stand before Him (on the Day of Judgment) to be asked
about all his deeds, yet he insists on committing misdeeds,
ignoring the Lord's Commands and Prohibitions, and
pretends to think of his Lord in a good way. This is simply
self-deception and self-delusion.
Abu Umamah Sahl bin Haneef ,$, said: "During the illness of
the Messenger of Allah ~ . Aishah ~ had six or seven dinars
on him which he ordered her to distribute, but she was kept
busy ministering to his suffering. He asked her what had
I

Surat Fussilat, Verse 23.

31

happened to the six or seven dinars, and when she replied
she had done nothing about them, because she had been kept
busy ministering to his suffering, he called for them, and,
placing them in his hand, said, "What would Allah's Prophet
think if he were to meet Allah, who is Great and Glorious,
while possessing these?" 2
What will oppressors and great sinners think of Allah ~ '
when they meet Him with all their acts of injustice?
Ibrahim (Abraham) ~' said to his people: ( Is it a falsehood
(gods other than Allah - that you desire? Then what do
you think of the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind,jinn, and
all that exists)?) 3 i.e. what do you think He ~ would do to
you when you meet Him, after having worshipped others
besides Him tit.,?
Whoever ponders well over this matter knows that thinking
good of the Lord is the way to perfect one's deeds . Indeed,
one commits himself to perfect his actions, because one has
a good opinion of one's Lord; that He would accept these
and compensate for them, accordingly.
To have a good opinion of the Lord while following one ' s
desires is a sign of inability, as highlighted in the Hadith
reported by Shaddad bin Aws ~' that the Prophet ~ said: "A
wise person is one who keeps a watch over his bodily desires
and passions, abstaining from that which is harmful, and
striving for that which will benefit him after death; while a
foolish person is one who subordinates himself to his

cravings and desires, and then expects Allah to fulfil his
futile desires. "4

Relying on the Mercy, Forgiveness and Generosity of
Allah~
Many ignorant people rely on the Mercy, Forgiveness and
Generosity of Allah ~' without following His Commands
and Prohibitions, forgetting that He ~ is severe in
punishment, and that His Wrath will never be withheld from
criminal (polytheist, sinning) people. So whoever relies on
the Mercy of Allah ~ ' while still insisting on committing
sins is just stubborn.
Ma'ruf has said: "Hoping for mercy from the One (Allah)
Whom you do not obey is but foolishness."
Al-Hasan said: "Some people have been distracted by the
hope of Allah's Grace, until they left this world without
having made any repentance. One of them said: 'Verily, I
have a good opinion of My Lord.' He simply lied, because if
he had had a good opinion of his Lord, he would have
perfected his deeds."
Usamah bin Zayd ~ reported that he heard the Prophet ~
say: "A man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and
thrown in the (Hell) Fire, so that his intestines will come out,
and he will go around like a donkey goes around a millstone.
The people of the (Hell) Fire will gather around him and say:

will reply: 'Yes, I used to order you to do good deeds, but I
did not do them myself, and I used to forbid you to do bad
deeds, yet I used to do them myself. "' 1
He also reported that Anas bin Malik 4, said: "The
Messenger of Allah ~ said: 'During my Nocturnal journey

enjoin righteousness on people but forgot to practise it
themselves. " 2
Anas 4, also reported that the Prophet ~ said: "On the night

world) from amongst the inmates of Paradise and he would

around him as if there were birds over our heads. He ~ had
in his hand a stick with which he was scratching the ground.
He then raised his head and said: 'Seek refuge in Allah from

The version of Jabir has the addition: "The dead man hears
the thumping of their sandals as the people who attend his
funeral go back, and at that moment he is asked: 'O so and
so! Who is your Lord, what is your religion, and who is your
Prophet?"' Hannad's version says: "Two angels will come
to him, make him sit up and ask him: 'Who is your Lord?'
He would reply: 'My Lord is Allah.' They will ask him:
'What is your religion?' He would reply: 'My religion is
Islam.' They will ask him: ' What is your opinion about the
man who was sent on a mission among you?' He would
reply: 'He is the Messenger of Allah ~ ·. They will ask:
'Who made you aware of this?' He would reply: ' I read
Allah's Book, believed in it, and considered it true; " ' which
is verified by Allah's ~ words: ( Allah establishes those
who believe with the word that stands firm in this world

spread a bed for him from Paradise, clothe him from
Paradise, and open a door for him into Paradise. So some of
its air and perfume will come to him, and a space will be
made for him as far as the eye can see."' He also mentioned
the death of an infidel, saying: "His spirit would be restored
to his body, two angels would come to him, make him sit up
and ask him: 'Who is your Lord?' He would reply: 'Alas,
alas! I do not know.' They will ask him: 'What is your

a bed for him from Hell, clothe him from Hell, and open for
him a door into Hell.' Then some of its heat and pestilential
wind will come to him, and his grave would become
compressed, so that his ribs would be crushed together."
Jabir's version adds: "One who is blind and dumb would
then be placed in charge of him, having a sledge-hammer
such that if a mountain were struck with it, it would become
dust. He would give him a blow with it, which would be
heard by everything between the east and the west except by

Majestic, made a covenant to those who drank intoxicants to
make them drink Tinat al-Khabal." They said: 'Messenger
of Allah, what is Tinat al-Khabal?' He said: 'It is the sweat

Hell. "' 2

Prophet~ performed the funeral prayer, and Sa'd was placed

snatch the people according to their deeds. Some people will
be ruined because of their evil deeds, and some will be cut
into pieces and fall down into Hell, but will be saved

His Servants, and intends to remove from the Fire whoever
He wishes to remove, of those who used to testify that none

We will order the angels to remove them and the angels will

as a martyr. He would be brought (before the Judgment
Seat). Allah would make him recount His Blessings (i.e. the
Blessings which He had bestowed upon him) and he would
recount them (and admit having enjoyed them during his
life). (Then) Allah will say: 'What did you do (to requite
these Blessings)?' He would say: 'I fought for Thee until I
died as a martyr.' Allah will say: 'You have told a lie! You
fought so that you might be called a "brave warrior". And
you were called so.' (Then) orders would be passed against
him and he would be dragged, face downward, and cast into
Hell. Then there would be brought forward a man who
acquired knowledge and imparted it (to others) and recited
the Qur'an. He will be brought, Allah will make him recount
His Blessings and he would recount them (and admit having
enjoyed them during his lifetime). Then Allah will ask:

had granted every kind of wealth. He would be brought,
Allah will make him recount His Blessings and he will

every cause in which Thou wished that it should be spent.'
Allah will say: 'You are lying.' You did (so) that it might be
said about (you): "He is a generous fellow", and so it was
said. Then will Allah pass orders and he would be dragged,
face downward, and thrown into Hell."2
I heard Shaikh Al-Islam, Ibn Taymiyah, saying: "Just as the
best of people are the Prophets, the worst of them are those
who pretend to be their followers, yet are not. The best
people after the Prophets are the scholars, the martyrs, the
truthful and sincere. Whereas the most evil people are those
who deceive people by pretending to be the followers of the
Prophets, while in fact, they are not."
Abu Hurayah ~ reported that the Prophet :i said: "Whoever
among you has unjustly demanded from his brother, in

before he is taken (he dies) while having no dirham or dinar
(no money to settle the injustice), so that (on the Day of
Resurrection) if he had any good deeds, they would be taken
from him and given to the other person, but if he had no
good deeds left to settle the matter, the bad deeds of that

Hell-Fire." 1
Abu Hurayrah 4, also reported that the Prophet ii said:
"Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, his neck
would be chained down with it down to the seven earths (on
the Day of Resurrection)." 2
Abu Hurayrah 4, also reported that the Messenger of Allah

ii said: "The fire of the children of Adam which they kindle
is a seventieth part of the Fire of Hell." They said:
"Messenger of Allah, this fire is certainly enough." He ii
said: "That Fire is sixty-nine times greater."3
There are many traditions about this subject, so no one
should disregard them, indulging in sins, and remam
attached to his good opinion of his Lord!
Abu Al-Wafa' bin 'Uqayl said: "Fear Him (Allah ii) and do
not deceive yourself; for a hand may be cut for stealing three
dirhams only; flogging can be applied for drinking a small
drop of wine; and a woman entered the Hell-Fire because of

Imam Ahmad said: "Abu Mu'awiyah reported that AlA'mash narrated from Salman bin Maysarah, from Tariq bin
Shihab, that the Prophet ;i said: "A man entered Paradise
because of a fly, and another man entered the Hell-Fire
because of a fly" The people asked: "Why, 0 Messenger of
Allah?" he :i replied: "Two men passed by a group of people
who had an idol they used to worship, however no one could
pass through unless they offered something to their idol.
The people said to one of them: Offer something to our idol.
The man replied: 'I have nothing to offer.' They told him:
'Offer something, even a fly.' So he offered a fly to their
god, and they let him go free, but he (later) was to end up in
the Hell-Fire. They told the other: 'Offer something.' He
replied: 'I would never offer anything except to Allah £.'

A careless word uttered by a person could lead him/her to
fall into the Hell-Fire, for a longer distance than that between
the East and West.
Some deceived people also rely on the fact that Allah ~
bestows His Blessings upon them in this world, believing
that it is due to His Love for them, and that in the Hereafter,
He ~ will grant even better blessings. But this is nothing
but self-deception.
Imam Ahmad said: "Yahya bin Ghaylan reported that:
Rushdayn bin Sa'd narrated, from Harmalah bin 'Imran atTajeeby, from 'Aqabah bin Muslim, from 'Aqabah bin
'Amir, that the Prophet ~ said: "When you see that Allah ~
is granting His Blessings to His Servant, even if the Servant
were committing sins, then it is an allurement" then he :i
recited: ( So, when they forgot (the warning) with which
they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates
of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their
enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden,
We took them (in punishment), and they were plunged
into destruction, with deep regret and sorrow) 1."2
A pious scholar once said: "If you see that Allah ~ bestows
His Blessings upon you, while you are still committing sins,
then be cautious of Him; it is just a way to draw you
gradually to His Punishment; for He ~ said: ( Were it not

that mankind would have become of one community, We
would have provided for those who disbelieve in the Most
Gracious (Allah), silver roofs for their houses, and
eievators whereby they ascend; and for their houses,
doors, and thrones on which they could recline; and
adornments of gold. Yet all this would have been nothing
but enjoyment in this world; but the Hereafter with your
Lord is for the pious believers)3 Allah~ has rebuked those
who think in this way, saying: ( As for man, when his Lord
tries him by giving him honour and bounties, then he
says: "My Lord has honoured me." But when He tries
him by straitening his means of life, he says: "My Lord
has humiliated me! Nay) 4 i.e. not all those I bestow My
Blessings are people I have honoured, and not all those I
have straitened their means of life I have humiliated. Rather,
I try one with My Blessings, and I honour the other with
trials.
The Prophet ~ said: "Verily, Allah ~ gives the world to
those whom He ~ loves and those whom He does not love,
but He ~ only give Iman (good faith) to those whom He ~
loves."5
Self-Deception
The person most deceived is the one who is deluded by this
world, preferring it to the Hereafter; seeking the pleasure of
this world more than that of the Hereafter, saying: the
pleasure of this world is certain, whereas that of the

48

Hereafter is uncertain, therefore, I shall not leave what is
assured and hope for what is doubtful.
This is one of the greatest deceits and enticements of the
devil. Even animals have more reason than those deceived
people; for an animal would not even attempt to follow a
way that would be harmful or damaging to its life.
People who say that they would never leave the assured for
the doubtful (as they claim) are either doubtful about the
Promise of Allah ~' His Reward, His Punishment and the
Truth of His Prophets, or they are certain about it. If you are
certain about it, then you are one who does not give much
importance to this world, which is due to end soon, but
instead prefer to be attached to a world that is more certain
and everlasting.
However, if you have any doubt, then you need to review the
Verses of the Revelation (in the Qur'an), which prove His
Existence, Omnipotence, Will and Oneness. The Verses also
give you the evidence about the truthfulness of Allah's
Messengers, regarding all the information about Him ~Search for the truth with impartiality and you will discover
that the Message brought by the Messengers about Allah ~
is undoubtedly the truth; that the Creator of this world and
the Lord of the heavens and earth is far above His Creation.
The inclusive law, to which everything submits, is the Way
of Allah ~' the Majestic King, to whom belongs the creation
and the authority, so whoever does not relate this Supremacy
to Allah ~. has denied Allah ~ in terms of His Lordship and
Sovereignty.

49

When a person reflects on his/her condition, as the one
whose creation began as a nutfah (a zygote or fertilized egg)
which developed into a perfect shape of due proportion, it
would become clear to him/her that the One Who has cared
for him/her in this manner, and carried him/her through these
conditions, would neglect or dismiss him/her carelessly,
without leaving any commands or prohibitions, knowledge
of rights, promises of reward, and warnings of punishment.
If a person ponders thoroughly over this subject, then
everything he/she observes and also that which he/she is
unable to observe would be seen to him/her as poof of
Monotheism (Allah's Oneness, as the One Lord behind this
world), for the Prophethood (of Muhammad ~), for the
Hereafter, and that the Qur'an is Allah's~ Word.

We have mentioned the evidence of this fact in the book,
"The Oaths in the Qur'an", as Allah~ said: (So, I swear by
whatsoever you see, and by whatsoever you do not see,
this is verily the word of an honoured Messenger) 1, and in
the interpretation of the Verse: (also in your own selves.
Will you not then see)2 , as the existence of man is proof of
the existence of his Creator, and confirmation of the
Creator's Attributes and Perfection.
If one asks: How could a person have a firm belief in (the
existence of) the Hereafter, Paradise and Hell, without
fulfilling his/her obligations? One should also ask how
someone could remember an appointed visit the following
day by a king, either to be punished or rewarded, yet spend
I

2

Surat Al-Haqqah, Verse 38-40.
Surat Adh-Dhariyat, Verse 21.

50

the night without thinking about this meeting with the king,
nor preparing for it?
We may say: By Allah, this is a good question which many
people ask themselves, because it is strange to see these two
conflicting points within a person, for they are due to many
reasons:
First, a lack of knowledge and uncertainty, for whoever
thinks that one's level of knowledge does not vary in this
context has a poor opinion.
Ibrahim ~ \ asked Allah ~ to show him the reviving of the
dead, despite the fact that he possessed the full knowledge of
the Omnipotence of Allah ~' as he ~I only wanted to
strengthen his conviction, by witnessing the event.
Imam Ahmad reported that the Prophet ~ said: "An informer
is unlike a witness."3
People may have flawed knowledge as well as a lack of
knowledge, due to influences such as worldly desires,
Satan's deception, delaying their promises, having endless
hope, being careless, etc.
All this is caused by a lack of patience and insight. Allah ~
has commended patient people, who have insight, saying:
(We made from among them leaders giving guidance
under Our Command, when they were patient and used
to believe, with certainty, in Our Signs) 1

51

The difference between (having) a good opinion and
being deceived
If a good opinion advocates work and action then 1t 1s
correct, however if it recommends idleness and indulgence in
sins, then it is deception.
Good opinion is a wish, so whoever' s wish is guiding him to
obey Allah ~' and preventing him from committing sins,
then it is a sound wish; but whoever's wish is to stay idle,
then he is definitely deceived. It is like someone who has
good opinion of Allah ~' with a strong wish to achieve the
highest level in Paradise, in an eternal Grace, without
obeying the Commands of Allah!
Allah ~ said: ( Verily, those who have believed, and those

who have emigrated (for Allah's Religion) and have
striven hard in the way of Allah; all these hope for
Allah's Mercy)2 . Look at how Allah ~ made their hope
based upon obeying Him (believed, emigrated for His
Religion, and strived hard).
The deceived people say: "Those who neglect the Rights of
Allah (upon His Servants), act unjustly towards other people,
and violate His sanctities, are also people who hope for
Allah's ~ Mercy."
However, having hope and a good opinion of Allah is rather
true when they come with the reasons suggested by the
Wisdom of Allah ~ in His Revelation, Divine Decree,
Reward and Generosity. A Servant of Allah ~ should fulfil
2

Surat Al-Baqarah, Verse 218.

52

his obligations and then have a good opinion of his Lord,
imploring the Lord to make them the cause of receiving His
Recompense.
Hope
It should be known that whoever hopes for something to

happen, is required to take three steps:
First, to love the thing he/she hopes for.
Second, to know that his/her hope could slip away.
Third, to endeavour to obtain this according to his/her
ability.
Abu Hurayrah ~ said: "The Messenger of Allah ~ said: "He
who fears sets out at nightfall, and he who sets out at
nightfall reaches the destination. Allah's commodity is dear.
Allah's commodity is Paradise."3
Allah ~ has placed the characteristics of hope and fear of
Him within good doers; therefore, He~ has made beneficial
hope and fear related to action, saying: (Verily, those who
live in awe of their Lord; and those who believe in the
Signs of their Lord; and those who join not anyone as
partners with their Lord; and those who give that (their
charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds)
with their hearts full of fear, because they are sure to
return to their Lord (for reckoning); it is these who
hasten in good deeds, and they are foremost in them.)4
Aishah .~ said: "I asked the Messenger of Allah ~ about this
Verse, and said: 'Are they the ones who drink wine,

charity; yet they fear whether their alms and charities have
been accepted or not; those who hasten in (doing) good
deeds." 1
Allah ~ described blessed people as people who act
perfectly, fearing Allah, and described wretched people as
those who do misdeeds, disregarding the Punishment of
Allah.
When we reflect on the lives of the Companions ~ . we
discover how they endeavour to act righteously, out of fear
and love for Allah ~. Abu Bakr as-Siddiq ~ was quoted as
saying: "I wish I were a hair in the side of believing
servant" 2 He ~ expressed the extent of his fear of Allah, and
how he would anything to please his Lord.
He ~ used to weep a lot and say: "Cry and if you can't, try
hard to."
When he ~ stood for prayers, he would stand like a piece of
wood, out of fear of Allah ~. When he was dying on his
bed, he said to Aishah :$,,: "I have obtained this cover, this
milker and this slave from the Muslim treasury; so please
take them quickly to Umar bin Al-Khattab. He~ also said:
"I wish I were this tree, to be eaten and bitten."
Abu Qatadah said: "I was told that Abu Bakr ~ said: 'I wish
I were herbs to be eaten by animals."'

As for Umar bin Al-Khattab 4,, it was said that he was
reciting Surat At-Tur, and when he reached the Verse:
( Verily, the Torment of your Lord will surely come to
pass), he cried so intensely that he fell ill, and was visited by
his Companions.
He ~ said to his son as he was dying: "Woe unto you! Place
my cheek on the ground, in the hope that Allah ~ might be
merciful to me."
He 4, would recite a Verse of the Qur' an and stay indoors
for days, receiving people who would come to visit him,
because of his excessive fear of Allah; he was extremely
mindful of the Punishment of Allah ~; he even had two
black lines on his face which marked the lines of his tears.
lbn 'Abbas 4, said to him: "Allah ~ has conquered new
lands with your hands (to spread Islam) ... " But he ~
replied: "I wish I would be safe, having no reward and no sin
in my account."
Uthman bin 'Affan ~ would cry as he stood before a grave,
until his beard would become totally wet. He 4, said: "If I
were to stand between Paradise and Hell, not knowing where
I would be taken, I would rather choose to be ashes before I
should know my final destination."
Ali bin Abi Talib 4, used to cry because he feared two
things: unfading hope, and following one's desires. He 4,
said: "Having unfading hope makes one forget the Hereafter,
while following one's desires deviates from the truth. This
world is retreating and the Hereafter is coming, so be among
the sons of the Hereafter, but do not be among the followers
of this world; because today there is action without

(any more) action."

you done in respect to what you have known?"'
He ~ used to say: "If you knew what you are facing after
death, you would not eat your meal nor drink with any
appetite ... I wish I were a tree to be bitten and then eaten."
Abu Dharr ~ also used to say: "I wish I were a tree being
bitten, and I wish that I were never born." Charitable gifts
were presented to him, to which he~ said: "We have goats
to milk, camels to transport ourselves, a servant to serve us, a
duvet to cover ourselves. So, I am worried about being
questioned about all these blessings on the Day of
Reckoning."
Tamim ad-Dari~ was reciting Surat Al-Jathiyah one night,
and when he read the Verse: ( Or do those who earn evil
deeds think that We shall hold them equal with those
who believe and do righteous deeds), and he kept reciting
it and crying all night, until dawn.
Abu 'Ubaydah 'Amir bin Al-Jarrah ~ said: "I wish I were a
sheep, slaughtered and eaten by my family. This is a long
chapter to follow."

Fear of a Believer that his Deed may come to Nothing while
he is Unaware"

Ibrahim Tamimi said: "Whenever I compare my word to my
deed, I fear that I may be wronged."
I have lived at a time where there thirty Companions of the
Prophet~; they were all worried about hypocrisy, and none
of them ever mentioned that the level of his belief was like
that Jibreel or Michael ~I.
Al-Hasan ~ said: "Only a believer has fear of Allah, and
only a hypocrite feels safe from Allah's Punishment."
Umar bin Al-Khattab ~ went to Hudhayfah ~' to whom the
Prophet ~ confided the names of the hypocrites in AlMadinah, and said to him: "I adjure you, by Allah. Has the
Prophet ~ named me?" (i.e. among the hypocrites).
Hudhayfah ~ replied: "No, but I will not vindicate anyone
else after you."
I heard that our Shaikh (Ibn Taymiyah) said: "Hudhayfah ~
did not mean that he would not defend anyone else from
hypocrisy, but that he did not want to give others the chance
to come and ask him whether they were named by the
Prophet ~' in the list of the hypocrites.

The harm caused by sins and misdeeds.
Let us return to the cure of this ailment, which if it continues,
would damage our potential in both this world and the
Hereafter.
It should be known that sins harm the doer; its harm to the

heart is like the effect of poison on the body, according to
the degree of the damage done. In fact, all evil and harm that

57

one faces, in this world and the Hereafter, are caused by
one's sins and misdeeds.
What ousted our parents (Adam and Eve ~I) from Paradise,
the place of pleasure, blessings and delight, to the dwelling
of pain, torment and misfortune?
What was the cause for the Satan to be kicked out of heaven,
and have his external and internal forms distorted? Allah ~
disfigured him to a most horrible shape, and made him
possess the most evil intentions. He ~ withdrew His Mercy
from him and made him live under His Curse. He ~
replaced Satan's dwelling from Paradise to Hell, because
Satan disobeyed Him ~ and turned to polytheism. He was
despised in the Sight of Allah ~ . because he followed his
own desires and rejected the Command of Allah ~ ' and so
earned His Anger.
Who as it who made all the people of the Noah drown until
water reached the top of mountains?
Who was it who set the wind on the people of 'Ad and
destroyed them, their dwellings and property, until they
became an example for other nations until the Day of
Resurrection?
Who was it who sent the awful cry to tear the hearts of the
disbelievers and destroy them all?
Who was it who lifted the villages of the homosexuals up in
the sky, until the Angels heard the barking of their dogs, and
then turned them upside down and destroyed them all with

58

marked stones from the heavens, to give them a punishment
not seen by any other nation before?
Who was it who sent upon the people of Shu'aib ~\
punishing clouds like shades, which, once above their heads,
rained down a blazing fire upon them?
Who made Pharaoh and his people drown in the sea, and
took their spirits to Hell?
Who destroyed Qarun (Korab), his property and family?
Who destroyed all the nations after Noah with different
forms of punishments?
Who dispatched slaves, who were given to terrible warfare,
to the Children of Israel, entering the very innermost parts of
their homes, killing their men, abducting their women and
children, burning their properties and plundering their
wealth?
Who afflicted the Children of Israel with several different
punishments: the destruction of their homes, setting
oppressive rulers to them, transforming them into monkeys
and pigs, and lastly by vowing: (to keep on sending against
them, till the Day of Resurrection, those who would
afflict them with a humiliating torment) 1?

replied: 'Woe unto you, 0 Jubayr! How worthless are people
in the Sight of Allah after they rejected His Command, when
once they were a sovereign nation. They turned away from
the Command of Allah, so this was their fate."
Ali bin Al-Ja'd said: "Shu'bah reported to us from Amru bin

said: 'So, what will Allah ~ do with such people (the pious
ones)?' He :I replied: 'They would suffer the punishment,
like the other people, but then they would benefit from the
Mercy of Allah." 3
Al-Hasan ~ reported that the Prophet :I said: "This Ummah

not vindicate the condition of its wrongdoers, and its
righteous people do not disregard its evil people. (But) if

Thawan ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said: "A man 1s
deprived of a blessing because of a sin he commits." 1
He ~ also reported that the Prophet ~ said: "People would
soon summon one another to attack you, as people do when
eating, inviting others to come and share their dish. Someone
asked: 'Would that be because of our small numbers, at that
time?' He replied: 'No, you will be numerous, at that time:
but you would be like the scum and rubbish that is carried
down by a torrent, and Allah will remove the fear of you
from the breasts of your enemy and placed lasting wahn
(enervation) into your hearts.' Someone asked: 'What is
wahn (enervation), 0 Messenger of Allah?' He ~ replied:
'Love of the world and dislike of death. "'2
Anas bin Malik ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said: "When I
was taken back to earth during my Nocturnal Journey, I
passed by some people who had nails made of copper, with

the religion fraudulently, for worldly ends, and wear
sheepskins in public to appear meek. Their tongues would be
sweeter than sugar, but their hearts would be as the hearts of
wolves. Allah will say: 'Are they trying to deceive me, or are
they acting presumptuously towards me? I swear, by myself,
that I shall send a trial upon those people, which would leave
the intelligent man among them confounded. ,,,4
Ibn Abi Dunya reported, on the authority of Ja'far bin
Muhammad, (reporting) from his father, (reporting) from his
grandfather, who said: "Ali ~ said: 'There will come a time
with people when nothing would be left of Islam, except its
name, and (nothing) of the Qur'an, except its caligraphy.
Their mosques would be full, but they would be void of right
guidance.
Their scholars are evil people; a fitnah
(tribulation) would originate from them, and return to them."
Sammak bin Harb reported, on the authority of AbduRahman bin Abdullah bin Mas'ud, from his father, who said:
"When fornication and usury spread through a country,
Allah~ gives the order for its destruction."
Al-Hasan reported in one of his letters: "When people show
that they possess knowledge, but waste that action
(implementation of that knowledge); and express their love

Curse of Allah, Who will make them deaf and blind (to His
Guidance)."

five attributes from which I seek refuge in Allah that you
might attain them: ( 1) When illegal sexual intercourse
spreads openly among people, they would be afflicted with
some diseases which were never witnessed by anyone before
them. (2) When people cheat in giving short measure (with
the scale), they would be afflicted by hardships and be
oppressed by their ruler. (3) When people refuse to pay their
Zakat, if it were not for the animals, they would be denied
rainfull. (4) When people break their promises, Allah will set
their enemy upon them. (5) When rulers do not govern with
the Laws revealed by Allah, in His Book, Allah will make
misery and misfortune prevail among them." 1
Amru bin Murrah reported from Salim bin Abi-Al-Ja'd, from
Abi Ubaydah bin Abdullah bin Mas'ud, from his father, who
said: "The Messenger of Allah ~ said: 'The first defect that
permeated Banu Israel was when one man (from them) met
another man and said: 'O so-and-so, fear Allah, and abandon
what you are doing, for it is not lawful for you. But then he
met him the following day and (saying) that never prevented
him from eating, drinking and sitting with him. So when
they did this, Allah mingled their hearts with each other. He
~ then recited the Verse: '( Curses were pronounced on

those among the children of Israel who rejected Faith, by
the tongue of David and Jesus, the son of Mary, because
they disobeyed and were even transgressing beyond
bounds)'. He~ then said: 'By no means, I swear by Allah,

with what is right, and limit him to what is right." 2
lbn Abi Dunya reported from Ibrahim bin 'Amru asSana' ani, who said: "Allah~ revealed to Yusa' bin Nun: 'I
am destroying forty thousand of your best people and sixty
thousand of your evil people.' He replied: 'O Lord, those are
evil people, but why should You destroy the good people?'
He ~ said: 'Because they were never angry, when I was
Angry, with those who disobeyed Me, but instead they used
to socialise (eat and drink) with them."
Abu Umar bin Abdul-Barr reported from Abu 'Imran, who
said: "Allah ~ sent two angels to a village with the order to
destroy everything therein. The angels found a man praying
in a mosque, so they said: 'O Lord, There is Your Servant so
and so, who is praying.' So Allah ~ said: 'Destroy all the
village including him, for his face has never shown any sign
of anger for My Sake."
Al-Hameedi reported from Sufyan, from 'Uyaynah, who
said: "Sufyan bin Sa'id reported from Mas'ar that an angel
was ordered to destroy a village. He said: 'O Lord, there a
worshipper so and so there.' So Allah ~ revealed to the
angel: 'Start with him, for he has never shown any sign of
anger for My Sake."
Ibn Abi Dunya reported from Wahb bin Munabi, who said:

Lord, how ( could this be possible) while You are the Just
Judge, Who never wrongs anyone; I committed the sin yet
You assign (disgrace) to others?' So Allah revealed to him:
'When you committed the sin, they never showed their
immediate disapproval of your deed."
Ibn Abi Dunya reported that Anas bin Malik ~ said: "I went
with another man to see Aishah ~ ' and he asked her: 'O
Mother of the believers, tell us about the earthquake? She
said: 'When they authorize fornication, drinking of wine, the
use of musical instruments, Allah ~ commands the earth:
'Tremble with them so that they might give up and repent.'
Otherwise, He ~ would destroy it upon them.' The man
asked: 'O Mother of the believers, is it a punishment for
them?' She replied: 'Rather it is some advice and mercy for
the believers, but a punishment and curse for the
disbelievers.' Anas said: 'I have never heard a Hadith, after
the death of the Messenger of Allah ?i, which made me
happier than this Hadith."
Ibn Abi Dunya reported a Mursal Hadith of the Prophet ?i:
"That the earth trembled during the lifetime of the Prophet
~. so he ?i placed his hand on it and said: 'Keep still, for it is
not your time yet.' Then he ~ turned to his Companions and
said: 'Your Lord wants you to please Him, so seek His
Pleasure.' When the earth trembled during the leadership of
'Umar bin Al-Khattab ~. he said: 'O people, this quake
would not have taken place unless it was for something that
you have innovated (in the matter of religion)! By the One in
Whose Hand my soul is, if this quake returns again, I should
not live among you in this land."

65

Umar bin Abdul-Aziz wrote to all the states in his reign:
'This quake is a censure from Allah ~ to His Servants. I
have written to all the states to give charity on such a day, in
such a month, for Allah ~ said: (Indeed whosoever
purifies himself shall achieve success, and remembers the
Name of his Lord and prays) 1• You should say what
Adam said: ( Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If
you do not forgive us, and do not bestow upon us Your
Mercy, we shall certainly be of the losers)2 and you should
say what Yunus ~ I (Jonah) said: ( La ilaha ilia anta (None

Imam Ahmad reported on the authority of Umar bin AlKhattab ~ who said: "States are on the verge of destruction
whilst they are populated." He was asked: 'How could they
be destroyed whilst they are still inhabited?' He ~ replied:
'When its wrongdoers outnumber its righteous people, and
its villages are ruled by its hypocrites."
Al-Awzai reported, on the authority of Hassan bin 'Atiyyah,
that the Prophet ~ said: "Evil people from my Ummah will
rule its righteous people, until a believer will hide himself,
exactly in the way a hypocrite hides among us today."
lbn Abi Dunya reported, on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas ~ .
that the Prophet ~ said: "There will come a time when the
heart of a believer will melt in the way that salt dissolves in

Allah?' He ~ replied: 'Because of (all) the evil deeds
(objectionable things) that he sees yet does not change."
Imam Ahmad reported, on the authority of Jarir, that the
Prophet ~ said: "(Concerning) any people around whom sins
are committed in their society, whilst are they numerous and
stronger than those who commit them yet never tried to
forbid them (the population) from doing so, Allah would
punish all of them." 5
Usamah bin Zayd ~ said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah ~

and thrown into the Fire. His hunch would be spilled on the
Fire, turning like a donkey which turns (a millstone) in a
mill. So, the people of Hell would gather around him and
ask: 'O, so and so, what is your matter? Were you not
enjoining good among us, and forbidding us from doing
evil?' He replied: 'Yes, I was, but I used to enjoin good
amongst you, yet never did it myself; and I used to forbid
you from doing evil, yet did it myself."' 1
Abdullah bin Umar ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said: "A
woman was punished because of a cat she imprisoned until
its death, so she entered the Hell-Fire. The woman neither
fed nor gave water to the cat, nor (even) let it eat the insects
of the land."2
From this perspective, the scholars have said that sins lead to
polytheism, just as kissing leads to sexual intercourse,
singing leads to fornication, an unlawful look (at a nonmahram person) leads to infatuation, and illness leads to
death.
Imam Ahmad said: "Al-Waleed reported: "I heard AlAwaza'i saying: 'I heard Bilal bin Sa'd saying: 'Do not look
at the smallness or insignificance of a sin, but look at the
One you have disobeyed."'

a sin, it becomes great in Allah's Sight, and as much as you
consider it great, it becomes small in Allah's Sight."
Abu Salih reported, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah ~.
that the Prophet ~ said: "When a believer sins there is a

till it gains ascendancy over his heart. That is the 'rust'

'No.' He replied: 'A man continues to commit sins,
privately, so Allah ~ sets hatred towards that man, in the
hearts of believers, from (a direction) where he could not

Abdullah bin Ahmad reported, in the book, Az-Zuhd, that
Muhammd bin Sirin felt so apprehensive because of an old
debt, so he said: "I know that the cause of this anxiety is a
sin which I had committed forty years ago."
Here we have an important concept regarding sins, which
people continue to underestimate: as they do not see the
effect of a sin, immediately. Its effect could be delayed, and
so people would forget it, and believe that they are not really
in the wrong, and therefore do not need to change
themselves.
Subhanallah! This misconception has caused so much
torment to many people; it deprived them of many blessings,
and caused them misfortunes.

This misunderstanding may be found among some scholars,
let alone ignorant people!
Imam Ahmad reported, on the authority of Abi Darda ~·,
who said: "Worship Allah as if you could see Him, and
know that a little (wealth) which makes you rich is better
than much which destroys you. You should know that piety
never decays, and that sins are never forgotten."

70

The effect of sins
Sins leave disturbing and damaging effects, on the body and
soul, which have consequences both in this world and the
Hereafter, which Allah ~' Alone, knows.
Some of these effects are:
Deprivation of knowledge: As knowledge is a light that
Allah ~ places inside the heart of His Servant, however
(committing) a sin extinguishes such a light.
Withdrawal of blessings: The Prophet ~ said: "A Servant of
Allah is denied blessings because of a sin he has
committed." Just as having awe for Allah and being
righteous attracts His Blessings, not having awe for Allah
leads to poverty.
Loneliness: A sense of isolation, which a sinner feels in
his/her heart, towards Allah ~ - Yet, this loneliness cannot
be compared to all the passion and appetite ones has for this
worldly life.
Also there is the alienation one may feel between oneself and
others, especially righteous people. When one's isolation
intensifies, one is deprived from benefiting from those good
people of knowledge, and so one is drawn ever closer to the
party of Satan. This isolation may even affect one's relation
with one's spouse, children and relatives, as it prevents one
from seeing one's true self.
One scholar of the past has said: "When I disobey Allah, I
see its effect in the conduct of my wife and my (riding)
camel towards me.

71

Facing hardship: Whenever someone sets out to achieve
something, he/she may face mounting difficulties; and this
goes to show that whoever obeys Allah ~ finds ease in
conducting all his/her matters.
Feeling anxiety: One may feel overcome by depression and
sadness, because one's sin leads to darkness in one's heart.
Indeed, obedience to Allah is light, but disobedience to Allah
is darkness. When one's darkness increases, one's confusion
intensifies, until one falls blindly into the world of
innovation and misguidance, just as a blind person walking
alone, at night. This darkness may become deeper and
gradually shows up as dullness in the face of a sinner.
Abdullah bin 'Abbas ~ said: "A good deed brings
illumination to the face, light in the heart, power in the body,
and love in the people's hearts. A bad deed shows as
dullness in the face, darkness in the heart, weakness in the
body, shortage of blessings, and hatred in people's hearts."
Prevention from doing other obedient acts: The punishment
which comes from a misdeed is that it leads to other
misdeeds, thus preventing someone from being obedient,
which would attract the Blessings and Grace of Allah ~- It
is like a person with food poisoning, deprived of many
delicious meals.
The shortening of one's lifespan: Indeed, sins shorten the life
of a sinner by denying him/her Allah's Blessings.
However, people have differed regarding this matter (the
shortening of one's life):

72

One group say: The shortening of the life of a sinner is the
removal of the blessings in his/her life, representing some
effects of sins in his/her life.
Another group say: Sins truly shorten the life of a sinner, just
as they reduce one's blessings; for Allah ~ has many
reasons for increasing the blessings in one's sustenance,
including the blessings of one's lifespan or age.
Another group say: The effects of sins in shortening the life
of a sinner is related to the fact that the reality of life is that
of the life of the heart, which is the reason why Allah ~
considers the disbeliever as dead, for He ~ said: ((They
are) dead, not alive.) 1
Life, in reality, is that of the heart, so the age of a person is
the duration of his/her proper life. Therefore, one's age is
the time in one ' s life that one devotes to Allah ~ - Piety,
righteousness and obedience increase at those times, which
represent the reality of his life, and there is no life except
this.
In effect, when a person turns away from Allah, and
dedicates him/herself to committing sins, he/she would waste
his/her real life here, about which he/she would say one day:
( Oh! If only I had prepared for this life of mine) 2
The life of a person is the duration of his/her life, for there is
no life except that of devotion to the Lord; praising Him,
remembering Him and pleasing Him.
I

Surat AI-Fajr, Verse 24.

Sins produce other sins
Sins lead to the production of other sins, until one finds it
hard to give them up. A scholar of the past has said: "Among
the punishments for a sin is committing a subsequent sin.
And among the recompenses for a good deed is doing a
subsequent good deed. When a person does a good deed,
another good deed besides it says: 'Do me as well.' If he
does it, a third one says likewise, and so on; therefore, his
good deeds, and recompense for them, increase. The same
thing occurs, (but in a negative way), when a person
commits a sin."
Consequently, good and bad deeds become established as
habits and attributes in one's life. If a righteous person
misses an obedient act, he/she would feel strained. He/she
would feel like a fish out of water, and would remain calm
only once he/she fulfilled his/her obligations.
On the other hand, if a sinner misses a sin, he/she would feel
strained, and would be only relax once he/she had committed
that sin. In fact, many sinners commit their sins without
savouring them, just to prevent the withdrawal symptoms of
missing them. One such prominent sinner has said:
"One glass (of wine) I drank for pleasure, followed by
another to heal myself from it (the first drink)."

Sins weaken the determination of the heart
Sins weaken the determination of the heart, and strengthen
the willpower to commit more sins. The resolve for
repentance is then weakened gradually, until it is totally
removed from the heart. Once half of one's heart is dead,
one could no longer repent to Allah ~- So, he/she would
express repentance intensely, while his heart is still attached

74

to these sins, insisting on committing them in any possible
manner. So this is one of the most serious ailments of the
heart, and the most destructive of all.

Sins become a custom
The continuity of committing sins would lead to a condition
where the heart would no longer regard them as vile. They
become a common practice, and so a sinner does not worry
anymore about other people's comments. Some of the
sinners even boast about their evil acts, informing others
who did not previously know what they had done. They
become extremely delighted when relating their sinful acts.
These type of people are denied a cure and a way to
repentance; for the Prophet ~ said: "All the sins of my
followers will be forgiven except those of the Mujahirin
(those who commit a sin openly or disclose their sins to
people). An example of such disclosure is of a person who
commits a sin at night, and although Allah has screened it
from the public, then he appears in the morning, saying: 'O
so-and-so, I did such-and-such a (evil) deed yesterday.' He
spent his night screened by his Lord (none knowing about
his sin), yet in the morning he removed Allah's Screen from
himself." 1
Every sin is inherited from an earlier nation which Allah ~
had destroyed. Homosexuality was inherited from the
People of Lut ~' (as most of the people in his village were
homosexuals). The cheating of the scales was inherited from
the People of Shu'aib ~ ,. Spreading corruption and

viciousness on earth was inherited from the rule of Pharaoh.
Tyranny and arrogance was inherited from the People of
Hud &JJI.
A sinner is therefore assuming the form of one of these
nations, which were enemies of Allah ~Abdullah bin Imam Ahmad reported in the book, Az-Zuhd of
his father, on the authority of Malik bin Dinar who said:
"Allah ~ revealed to one of the Prophets of the Children of
Israel tell his people: 'Do not follow the path of My
Enemies; do not assume the form of My Enemies; do not
board the ships of My Enemies; do not eat the food of My
Enemies; thus they would become like My Enemies."
Abdullah bin Umar $> reported that the Prophet ~ said: "I
was sent with a sword before the Hour, until Allah ~ is
worshipped Alone, without associating any partners with
Him. My provision was made under the shade of my lance,
and disgrace was set on those people who oppose my
command; and whoever copies the manner of a people, he is
one of them." 2

The sin is the cause for disgrace from Allah ~
Al-Hasan Al-Basri, may Allah have mercy upon him, said:
"Allah ~ disgraces them (sinners) as they disobeyed Him. If
He ~ had honoured them, He ~ would have safeguarded
them from committing sins; and those Allah ~ humiliates

2

Recorded by Ahmad in his Musnad (2/ 50, 92).

76

will have no one to honour them; for He ~ said:
(Whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can honour him) 3
A person also continues to commit a sin until he attaches
little importance to it, and the more a sin becomes
insignificant to a person, the more it becomes serious and
great in the Sight of Allah.
Ibn Mas'ud ~ said: "A believer sees his sins as if they were
the base of a mountain, which he fears might fall on him;
whereas the sinner considers his sins like some flies landing
on his nose, which he repels so they fly away." 4

The misfortunes resulting from sins and wrongdoings
Other people and animals suffer misfortunes because of a
person's sins.
Abu Hurayrah ~ said: "Bustards die in their nests because of
the injustice of the wrongdoer."
Mujahid said: "Animals curse the sinners among the
Children of Adam in times of hardship and drought. They
say: This calamity is the result of the sins of mankind."
'Ikrimah said: "All animals, including dung beetles and
scorp10ns say: 'We are denied rain because of the sins of
mankind."'

Surat Al-Hajj, Verse 18.

Sins cause disgrace
Sins bring down dishonour and humiliation on sinners. All
dignity is in obeying Allah ~; He ~ said: (Whosoever
desires honour and glory, then to Allah belong all honour
and glory) 1 i.e. one should seek it honour and glory by
being obedient to Allah~One supplication of a scholar of the past was: "O Allah!
Honour me with my obedience to You, but do not disgrace
me with my disobedience to You."
Al-Hasan Al-Basri said: "The disgrace of a sin never leaves
sinners, for Allah ~ has willed that He will disgrace
whoever disobeys Him."
Sins corrupts one's intellect
Sins corrupt the mind; for the mind has its insight, and a sin
inevitably extinguishes that insight. One scholar of the past
has said: "No one disobeys Allah ~ unless their mind is
absent (or deficient); and this is evident, for if one's mind
were present, to prevent him from committing a sin, one
would be under the Protection of Allah ~ ' Who is fully
aware of all his conditions."
The accumulation of sins leads to the sealing of the heart
When a person indulges incessantly in sin and wrongdoings,
his/her heart becomes sealed up, and he/she would be
careless and thoughtless, as reported by a scholar in his
interpretation of the Verse: (Nay, but on their hearts is the

Raan (covering of sins and evil deeds) which they used to
earn)2, he said: "It is one sin after another sin."
Al-Hasan Al-Basri said: "It is one sin on top of another sin,
until the heart becomes blind."
Others have said: "When the wrongdoings and misdeeds of
sinners become vastly increased, they will surround their
hearts."
The reality of this ailment is that the heart becomes rusty
because of a sin; so when sins increase, the rust increases
until it surrounds all the heart, until it dominates it, becoming
a seal over it.

A sinner comes under the Curse of the Messenger of
Allah ~ because of his own sins
The Prophet~ cursed the doer of many sins:
He ~ cursed the maker of tattoos and the person who wears
them.
He ~ cursed the "wasilah" and "mawsulah" (that is the
woman who artificially lengthens (her or someone else's)
hair and the one who gets her hair lengthened).
He ~ cursed the "namisah" and "muntamisah" (that is the
woman who tears out hair of (her or someone else's)
eyebrows or the one who get it done.

2

Surat Al-Mutaffifin, Verse 14.

79

He ~ cursed the "washirah" and "mustawshirah" (that is the
woman who tattoos (herself or someone else) or the one who
gets herself tattooed).
He Ii cursed the one who benefits from usury and the one
who participates in a transaction of usury (writing, signing or
witnessing it, etc)
He Ii cursed the wine-presser, the one who has it pressed,
the one who drinks it, the one who conveys it, the one to
whom it is conveyed, the one who serves it, the one who
sells it, the one who benefits from the price paid for it, the
one who buys it, and the one for whom it is bought, etc.
He Ii cursed the thief.
He Ii cursed those who alter the natural features of the earth
and its boundaries.
He Ii cursed the one who curses his parents.
He ~ cursed the effeminate among men, and women who
assume the manners of men.
He Ii cursed those who slaughter animals not for the Sake of
Allah ~ He Ii cursed those who innovate in matters of religion.

animals).

He ~ cursed those who act in the manner of the people of
Lut ~I (homosexuals).
He ~ cursed the one who misguides a blind person.
He~ cursed the one who performs a sexual act with animals
(beastiality).
He ~ cursed the one who marks an animal on its face.
He ~ cursed the one who harms a Muslim and deceives him.
He ~ cursed those who visit graves to worship the dead, and
those who build mosques and place lamps on them (the
graves).
He ~ cursed those who insult and abuse the Companions ~Allah ~ cursed those who cause corruption on earth and
break ties with their kin, and those who transgress the Laws
of Allah ~ and His Messenger ~He ~ cursed those who conceal the Revelation of Allah ~He ~ cursed those who accuse believing chaste women of
illegal sexual acts.
He ~ cursed the one who assumes the path of the
disbelievers to be more guided than the path of the Muslims.
The Prophet~ cursed a man wearing women's clothes, and a
woman wearing men's clothes.
He~ cursed the bribers, the person who receives bribes (the
bribed), and the mediator between them.

81

Sins deprive the sinner of the benefit of the Prophet's
supplication
We know that Allah ~ ordered His Prophet ~ to seek
forgiveness for the believing men and women, as He ~ said:
(Those (Angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah) and
those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and
believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who believe
(in the Oneness of Allah), saying: "Our Lord! You
comprehend all things, in mercy and knowledge, so
forgive those who repent and follow Your way, and save
them from the torment of the blazing Fire! Our Lord!
And make them enter the Paradise of Eden which you
have promised them - and to the righteous among their
fathers, their wives, and their offspring! Verily, You are
the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. Save them from sins, and
whomsoever You save from sins that Day, him verily,
You have taken into mercy." That is the supreme
success.) 1
This is the supplication of the Angels for the repentant
believers, who follow the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of
His Messenger ~- Other people should not seek benefit
from this supplication, if they do not possess the same
attributes.

The punishments for sins
Sumrah bin Jundub ~ said: "The Prophet ~ very often used
to ask his companions: 'Did anyone of you see a dream?' So
dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah
wished to tell. One morning, the Prophet~ said: 'Last night

Surat Ghafir, Verses 7-9.

82

two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and
said to me: 'Proceed!' I set out with them and we came
across a man lying down, and behold, another man was
standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was
throwing the rock at the man's head, injuring it. The rock
rolled away, so the thrower followed it and picked it up
again. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to
the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had
done before. I said to my two companions: 'Subhan Allah!
Who are these two persons?' They said: 'Proceed!' So we
proceeded and came to one man lying flat on his back and
another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and
behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's
mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the
neck), and similarly tear his nose from front to back, and his
eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of
the man's face and did just as he had done with the other
side. He hardly completed this side when the other side
returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat
what he had done before. I said to my two companions:
'Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?' They said to
me: 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came across something
like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined
for baking bread)' - I think the Prophet~ said: 'In that oven
there was much noise and voices.' The Prophet added: 'We
looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold,
a flame of fire was approaching them from underneath, and
when it reached them, they screamed loudly. I asked them:
'Who are these?' They said to me: 'Proceed!' And so we
proceeded and came across a river' - I think he ~ said:
' ... red like blood.' The Prophet added: 'And behold, in the
river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was
a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the

83

other man was swimming, he went near him. The former
opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone
into his mouth, whereupon he continued swimming again.
He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I
asked my two companions: 'Who are these (two) persons?'
They replied: 'Proceed! Proceed!' And we proceeded till we
came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most
repulsive appearance, you could ever saw a man having!
Next to him there was a fire, which he was kindling it and
running around. I asked my companions: 'Who is this
(man)?' They said to me: 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we
proceeded till we reached a garden with dense, deep green
vegetation, possessing all sorts of spring colours. In the
midst of the garden there was a very tall man, and I could
hardly see his head because of his great height, and around
him there were children, in such a large number as I have
never seen (before). I said to my companions: 'Who is this?'
They replied: 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we
came to a huge majestic garden, greater and better than I
have ever seen (before)! My two companions said to me:
'Go up,' and I went up.' The Prophet added: 'So we
ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks,
and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open
the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and
found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as
the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other
side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My
two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into
the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city),
and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went
and threw themselves in it, and then returned to us after the
ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became
(restored to) the best shape.' The Prophet~ further added:

84

'My two companions (angels) said to me: 'This place is the
Paradise of Eden, and that is your place.' I raised up my
sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud!
My two companions said to me: 'That (palace) is your
place.' I said to them: 'May Allah bless you both! Let me
enter it.' They replied: 'As for now, you will not enter it, but
you shall enter it (one day). I said to them: 'I have seen many
wonders tonight. What does all that mean, that which I have
seen?' They replied: 'We will inform you: As for the first
man you came upon whose head was being injured with the
rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur'an and
then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps,
neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the man you came
upon whose sides of his mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn
off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes
out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it
spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women
whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they
are the adulterers and the adulteresses, and the man whom
you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow,
is the eater of usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom
you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik,
the gatekeeper of Hell, and the tall man whom you saw in
the garden is Abraham, and the children around him are
those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).'
The narrator added: 'Some Muslims asked the Prophet: 'O
Messenger of Allah! What about the children of pagans?'
The Prophet replied: 'And also the children of pagans.' The
Prophet added: 'My two companions added: 'The men you
saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who

85

had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad,
but Allah forgave them." 1

Other effects of sins and misdeeds
Sins cause corruption and rottenness to different aspects of
the environment, such as one's residence, water, air, plants
and fruit. Allah~ has said: (Evil (sins and disobedience to
Allah) has appeared on land and sea because of what the
hands of men have earned, that He (Allah) may make
them taste a part of that which they have done, in order
that they may return (by repenting to Allah and begging
His Pardon)2
Mujahid said: "When an oppressor is given responsibility, he
spreads injustice and evil deeds, so Allah ~ withholds the
rainfall, so the oppressor puts his effort into making mischief
in the land; destroying the crops and the cattle. But Allah ~
does not like mischief." Then he recited: (Evil (sins and
disobedience to Allah) has appeared on land and sea
because of what the hands of men have earned.) Then he
said: 'By Allah, it is not your sea here, but it refers to every
community located by a flowing river.'
'Ikrimah said: "Evil has appeared on land and sea. I do not
say it is this sea of yours, but every community situated near
water."

Muslim in the, "Book of Visions", (Hadith 17), Abu Dawud in the,
"Book of Sunnah", (chapter 8), At-Tirmidhi in the, "Book of Visions",
(chapter I 0), Al-Muwatta' in the, "Book of Visions", (Hadith 2), and
Ahmad in his Musnad (5/ 14, 44, 50).

Surat ar-Rum, Verse 41.

86

I say: Allah ~ has named sweet water as sea, saying: ( The
two seas (kinds of water) are not alike; this is palatable,
sweet and pleasant to drink, and that is salty and bitter) 1;
there is no sea which is both sweet and still. Sweet water is
in running rivers, while the bitter sea is still. So Allah ~
named the communities located by running rivers with the
name of that water.
Ibn Zayd recited the Verse (Evil (sins and disobedience to
Allah) has appeared on land and sea), saying: "It is sins."
He meant that sins are the cause for the appearance of all
aspects of evil, which Allah ~ made as a punishment for
sinners. Whenever they produce a sin, Allah ~ produces a
punishment for them, as highlighted in the Verse: (that He
(Allah) may make them taste a part of that which they
have done). Allah ~ only makes us taste a small part of
what we have done. But, should He ~ make us taste the
effect of all the sins that we have committed, He ~ would
not have left any human on this earth!
Among the effects of sins on this earth is the occurrence of
earthquakes and other seismic activities, which Allah ~
causes as a punishment and as a withdrawal of His Blessings
on it.
The Prophet ~ passed by the village of Thamud2 , and
forbade his Companions from entering their dwellings,
except when weeping (out of fear of the Punishment of Allah
'M which destroyed the nation of Thamud). He ~ forbade
them from drinking the water of that village, or eating

87

anything made by using that water, because of the effect of
the sins committed by that community, which had led to the
shortages and deficiency in their produce, etc.
Imam Ahmad reported in his Musnad: "There was found in
the treasure house of Banu Umayyah a grain of wheat the
size of a date-stone, in a container on which was written:
'This would grow in times of justice."'
Many diseases were produced (Allah ~ made them occur)
because of the sins of His Servants.
A group of desert people informed me that dates used to be
much bigger than they are now, and they had never
witnessed the diseases which affect their fruit now.
Sins can also affect the shape and creation. At-Tirmidhi
reported that the Prophet ~ said: "Allah ~ created Adam,
and his height was sixty arms. Mankind continues to shorten
(in size) until now .. ." 3
When Allah ~ decides to purify the earth from oppressors,
wrongdoers and traitors, He ~ brings out one of His
Servants, from the family of His Prophet '.!;, to spread justice
on the earth after it was filled with injustice. Isa ~I (Jesus)
will be sent to fight the Jews and Christians, the followers of
Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal, the False Messiah, and establish Islam
on earth. It will be then that the earth will bring forth its
blessings and would return to its normal state. Hunters
would eat their kill and then take shade underneath its skull.
A bunch of grapes would become a heavy load for camels.
3

Recorded by Al-Bukhari in the book, "The Prophets", (chapter I).

88

All this will take place because when the earth is purified of
sins, the traces of Allah's Blessings would appear on its
surface once more.

The Punishments for Sins
Sins extinguish the light of ghaira (the sense of honour) in
the heart. The sense of honour is to a person ' s life like the
basal temperature is to the rest of the body; it removes all
aspects of wickedness and bad attributes in one's
personality. The most dignified people are the ones who
observe a strong sense of honour in themselves, their
families, and others. The Prophet ~ had more ghaira than
anyone else towards the Ummah, and Allah ~ has more
ghaira than him, as confirmed in the Hadith, in which the
Prophet ~ said: "Do you wonder at Sa' d's sense of ghaira
(ardour)? Verily, I have more sense of ghaira than Sa'd, and
Allah has more sense of ghaira than I." 1
The Prophet ~ also said in the sermon about the eclipse: "O
followers of Muhammad! By Allah! There is none who has
more ghaira (self-respect) than Allah as He has forbidden
that His Servants, male or female, commit adultery (illegal
sexual intercourse). " 2
He ~ also said: "No one has more ghaira than Allah. There
is none who has a greater sense of ghaira than Allah, and for
that reason He has forbidden shameful sins, whether
committed openly or secretly. And there is none who likes
that people should repent to Him and beg His pardon more

than Allah, so for this reason He sent (us) warners and
bearers of good news. And there is none who likes to be
praised more than Allah does, so that is why He praises
Himself. " 3
He ~ combined, in this Hadith, the sense of honour, the basis
of which is a dislike of all that is evil, and love of apology
and forgiveness, which suggests the perfection of justice and
mercy.
People should seek forgiveness from Allah ~ , Who has the
Most sense of ghaira, for He ~ pardons those who repent to
him.
Allah ~ never held His Servants to account for their
misdeeds until He ~ had given them a chance to seek His
Pardon. It is for this reason that He ~ dispatched His
Messengers ~ and sent down His Revelation as a warning,
for this shows the utmost Glory and Perfection.
There are many people who hastily proceed to punish others,
once their sense of honour intensifies, without allowing them
to make any excuses. Their extreme ghaira does not let
them accept any excuse. On the other hand, there are other
people who accept any excuse, because they have a week
sense of honour.
The Prophet ~ said: "There is jealousy which Allah loves
and jealousy which Allah hates. That which Allah loves is
3

Recorded by Al-Bukhari in the "Book of Tawheed" , (chapter 15, 20),
Muslim in the "Book of Repentance", (Hadith 32-36), At-Tirmidhi in the
"Book of Supplications", (chapter 95), Ahmad in his Musnad (II 381,
432).

90

jealousy regarding a matter of doubt, and that which Allah
hates is jealousy regarding something which is not
doubtful. " 4
What is recommended is to combine ghaira with excuse.
One should exert his sense of honour in the right
circumstances, and excuse others at a time for excuses.
Allah ~ possesses the complete Attributes of Perfection.
Therefore, He ~ is the One truly deserving All Praise. None
should praise in their manners, except in the manner in
which He ~ has praised Himself.
The one who observes a good sense of honour is indeed in
harmony with one of Allah's Attributes, which will draw
him/her closer to Allah's Mercy, and make him/her dearer to
Allah ~' Who is All-Merciful and loves the merciful among
His Servants; He ~ is the All-Generous and loves the
generous among His Servants; He ~ is the All-Knower and
loves the scholars among His Servants; He ~ is the AllPowerful and loves the strong believer more than the weak
believer.
Sins and all evil acts prevent a person from assuming these
attributes; a small thought turns into a devilish whispering; a
whispering turns into a will, which turns into a strong
determination and becomes an action. The sinful act later
becomes an established practice in the life of the sinner, and
then it becomes difficult to give it up.
4

Recorded by Abu Dawud in the "Book of Jihacf', (chapter 104), anNassai in the "Book of Zakat", (chapter 66), lbn Maajah in the "Book of
Marriage", (chapter 56) and Ahmad in his Musnad (5/ 445, 446).

91

As the sinner becomes intensely attached to his evil acts, his
sense of honour weakens towards himself, his family and the
rest of people. It weakens to such extent that he no longer
sees the evil in his actions, which is the final stage of his
destruction. In fact, many of such people encourage others
to do the same, and this is the reason that a cuckold is the
most repulsive of Allah's creation, and why Paradise is
forbidden for him.
This proves that ghaira is a basis of religion; and he who has
no ghaira, has no religion. Ghaira protects the heart and the
limbs, and block all aspects of sins.
The ghaira in the heart is like the power of immunity which
resists to any incoming ailment.
Sins eliminate Haya' (Modesty)
Sins take away from the sinner all sense of modesty which is
the living substance of the heart. Modesty is defined as the
basis of all good, and its removal is the elimination of all that
is good.

The Prophet ~ said: "Haya ' is all good." 1
He ~ also said: "A part of that which people understood
from the speech of the earlier prophets is: 'If you have no
shame, do what you want. "'2 This Hadith has two
interpretations:
1

Recorded by Muslim in the "Book of Iman", (Hadith 61) and Ahmad in
his Musnad (4/ 426, 427, 436).
2
Recorded by Al-Bukhari in the book, "The Prophets", (chapter 54), Abu
Dawud in the book, "Al-Adab", (chapter 6), Ibn Maajah in the book, "AzZuhd'', (chapter 17) and Ahmad in his Musnad (4/ 121, 122) (5/ 273).

92

First, it threatens and warns of punishment, because the one
who has no shame does all evil acts, due to the lack of
modesty and shame, which was the interpretation of Abu
Ubaydah, may Allah be pleased with him.
Second, if the action does not exceed the boundaries of
shame from Allah, then do it, and what should be avoided is
the action which is too shameful to do before Allah. This
was the interpretation of Imam Ahmad according to the
narration of Ibn Hani'.
The first is a warning or a threat as in the Verse: (Do what
you will) 3, while the second is in the form of permission.
If it is said: Is there any possibility to assume both
interpretations?
I say: No, because there is a great difference between
permission and warning; however, considering one of the
interpretations suggests considering the other.
Sins weaken all factors of modesty in a person, to an extent
that one becomes careless, despite knowing that other people
are aware of his sinful life. The majority of the sinners are
not ashamed to discuss their evil deeds, because they possess
no sense of decency or modesty.

Sins weaken the heart
Sins affect one's heart so it fails to glorify the Lord ~ and
weakens its sense of tranquillity. If one's heart was filled
with sobriety it would not have dared to commit any sin.
3

Surat Fussilat, Verse 40.

93

Some deceived people say: "What induces me sometimes to
commit sins is the hope of benefiting from Allah's Mercy,
not the weakness of glorifying Him in my heart."
This is simply self-deception; because glorifying Allah ~ in
one's heart means glorifying His Sanctity, which would
oppose the committing of any sins.
Those who boldly indulge in disobeying Allah ~ do not
consider Him with the correct estimation due to Him~.
This is a punishment from Allah ~ which removes the sense
of fear from the hearts of His Servants, so that sinners would
despise hitn/her the way he/she disrespected the Commands
of Allah ~ People love another person according to his/her level of love
for Allah ~ ; they fear hitn/her according to the level of
his/her fear of Allah; they praise him/her according to the
level of his/her praise for Allah ~. How could a person
violate the sanctity of Allah ~ and not expect people to
violate his/her sanctity?
Allah ~ has stated in His Book (the Qur'an) the punishment
due for sins. He ~ cast the big sinners into a state of
disbelief for what they had earned. He ~ sealed their hearts
with their sins, and forgot them the way they had forgotten
their Lord. He ~ wasted them the way they had wasted His
Religion. Allah ~ stated in His Book, after describing the
prostration of all His Creatures to Him: (Whomsoever
Allah disgraces, none can honour him)1; when they
I

Surat Al-Hajj, Verse 18.

94

despised the act of prostrating to Allah ~ and refused to
perform it, He ~ disgraced them; and no one could honour
them after they had been humiliated by Allah ~Sins may lead a person to become forgotten by Allah ~
It is a punishment for a sinner, indulging in sins, to
eventually be forgotten by Allah ~' and left alone with the
devil. This is a stage of destruction for which there is no
hope of safety. For Allah~ has said: ( 0 you who believe!
Fear Allah and keep your duty to Him. And let every
person look to what he has sent forth for the morrow,
and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is All-Aware of what you
do. And be not like those who forgot Allah, and He
caused them to forget themselves. Those are the Fasiqun
(rebellious and disobedient to Allah) 2
Allah ~ ordered us to fear Him (be mindful of Him in all our
actions) and warned us not to imitate those who have
become disobedient to Him. He ~ informed us that He
punished those who had rejected righteousness, by letting
them forget themselves - i.e. to forget the benefits which
could save them from the Punishment in the Hereafter.
Allah ~ made them forget the Right Path, which would lead
them to the Eternal Life in Paradise where they could enjoy
its perfect blessings.
You may see the sinner selfishly wasting benefits for
him/her self, as his heart is made heedless of remembrance
Allah ~ ; he/she follows his/her own lusts, so his/her deeds
have been lost, because he/she rejects the priceless Reward
of Allah for the meagre affairs of this world!

95

A sinner only has him/her self to blame, for he/she is unjust
to him/her self, not to Allah ~ - Allah ~ is the Provider of
all Blessings, and is not in need of anything from His
Creatures.
Sins take a person out from the scope of lhsan
lhsan is perfection in performing one's obligations. It is
worshipping Allah as though you see Him, but if you are
unable to imagine Him, you should remember that He ~
sees you.
When a sinner is removed from the state of lhsan, he/she is
deprived of receiving the Reward(s) of Allah ~' which are
given to those who excel in fulfilling their religious duties.
When lhsan is related to the heart, it prevents it from
committing sins; because a person who worships Allah ~ '
with perfection, is one whose heart is filled with love, hope,
fear and remembrance of Allah ~ - He worships Allah ~ as
though he sees Him, and so he is prevented from disobeying
Him.
Therefore, when a person is removed from the state of lhsan,
he/she is left among his/her own private company to try to
enjoy life. If Allah ~ wants good for him/her, He ~ assigns
him/her at the circle of the believers; but if he/she disobeys
Allah ~ and indulges in sins, Allah ~ removes him/her from
the state of Iman (good faith), as was said by the Prophet ~ :
"A fornicator is not a believer at the time of committing
fornication. The one who drinks wine is not a believer at the

96

time of drinking wine. A thief is not a believer at the time of
thieving ... " 1
Therefore, avoid committing sins, whatever their nature, and
take the chance to repent, while it is still possible for you to
do so.

Sins deprive a person of the protection of Allah ~ Whoever avoids the company of the believers, has denied the
Protection of Allah ~' Who defends those who believe, and
denied all the good things mentioned by Allah ~ in his Book
that are provided for the believers. There are around a
hundred qualities, and each one is better than this world and
what it contains; for example:
Great reward: (And Allah will grant the believers a Great
Reward) 2
Protection from the evil of this world and the Hereafter:
( Truly, Allah defends those who believe) 3
The Angels who bear the Throne seek forgiveness for the
believers: (Those (Angels) who bear the Throne (of Allah)
and those around it glorify the praises of their Lord, and
believe in Him, and ask forgiveness for those who
believe) 4

Allah ~ commands His Angels to reassure the believers:
( When your Lord revealed to the Angels, "Verily, I am
with you, so keep firm, 0 those who have believed) 6
They have honour: (But honour, power and glory belong
to Allah, and to His Messenger (Muhammad ~), and to
the believers, but the hypocrites do not know.) 7
Allah is in the company of the believers: ( Verily, Allah is
with the believers)
Exaltation in higher degrees: ( Allah will exalt in degree
those of you who believe) 9
Allah ~ grants righteous people a double portion of His
Mercy, a light to guide them in their life, and forgiveness of
their misdeeds.
Allah ~ loves them and makes His Angels, His Prophets,
and all His Pious Servants love them too: ( Verily, those
who believe and work deeds of righteousness, the Most
Gracious will bestow love upon them) 1

Allah ~ bestows the feeling of serenity upon them: ( So
whosoever believes and does righteous good deeds, upon
such shall come no fear, nor shall they grieve)2
Allah ~ is the One Who bestows His blessings upon them,
and commands us to ask Him to guide us to their right path,
seventeenth times, every night and day (when reciting Surat
Al-Fatihah).
The Qur'an is a guide and healing for them: ( Say: It is for
those who believe, a guide and healing. And as for those
who disbelieve, there is heaviness in their ears, and it is
blindness for them. They are those who are called from a
place, far away ) 3
Every good in this world and the Hereafter is caused by good
faith (and every evil in this world and the Hereafter is caused
by the absence of the good faith).
Some people care little about committing sins, which would
take them out from the state of Iman (faith), but it does not
mean they are no longer Muslims. However, if they persist
on committing sins, then there is worry that their hearts
might become overcome by those sins, which means they
could end up being removed from the status of Islam
altogether.

It is for this reason that one scholar of the past said: "You
fear sins, but I fear polytheism."

Sins weaken the course of the heart towards Allah and
the Last Day
Sins stand as obstacles in the way of one's heart, in obeying
the Lord; they prevent one from stepping forward towards
one's Lord, in a state of purity.
The heart normally moves towards Allah with strength, but
when it is overpowered by sins, its power is weakened; and
if its power is removed, the heart breaks its connection with
Allah ~' so then it becomes harder to bring it back.
A sin could either kill the heart, or inflict it with a serious
ailment, weakening its power, until its weakness ends in one
of the eight ailments, from which the Prophet ~ sought
refuge in Allah, which are: Worry, grief, inability, laziness,
cowardice, miserliness, the heavy burden of debts, and the
overpowering of men.
Worry and grief are connected; when a troubling matter
invades the heart which is concerned with a future expected
matter, then it causes worry. But if it was concerned with a
past matter, it causes grief.
Inability and laziness are connected: if a person neglects the
factors which produce goodness and success, because of
his/her incapacity, then it is inability. But if the reason is
due to a lack of will, then it is laziness.
Cowardice and miserliness are connected: if a person
produces no benefit, when the cause is in his/her body, then
it is a matter of cowardice. But if it is due to his/her wealth,
then it is miserliness.

100

The burden of debts and the overpowering of men are
connected: when other people act with a sense of superiority
towards a person, and the reason is justified, then it is out of
the heavy burden of a debt. But if it is not justified, then it is
due to the overpowering of men.
Sins are one of the reasons which bring these eight ailments.
They bring evil affliction, misery, the most terrible
calamities, and the malice of enemies. They are also one of
the powerful reasons that lead to the cessation of Allah's
Blessings, which later tum into His Punishment and Curse.

Sins hold back the Blessings of Allah ~ (to come) and
incite His Anger
No blessing is removed from a Servant of Allah ~ except by
his/her own misdeeds; and no misfortune or punishment
befalls him/her but from his/her own sins.
Ali bin Abi Talib ~ said: "No affliction comes down except
due to a sin, and it is not removed except with repentance",
for Allah ~ said: (Whatever of misfortune befalls you, it
is because of what your hands have earned. And He
pardons muchY He ~ also said: ( That is so because
Allah will never change a Grace which He has bestowed
on a people until they change what is in themselves.) 2
Allah ~ informs us that He will not change the Blessings,
which He ~ has bestowed upon His Servant, unless His
Servant changes them for him/her self. But a sinner changes
1

2

Surat Ash-Shura, Verse 30.
Surat Al-Anfal, Verse 53 .

101

obedience to Allah into disobedience, thankfulness for the
Blessings of Allah into ungratefulness towards Him ~' and
the causes that lead to Allah's Pleasure into those that cause
His Curse. Allah ~ said: (Verily, Allah will not change
the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not
change their state themselves (by continuing to commit
sins and be ungrateful and disobedient to Allah)) 3

Allah ~ instils terror and fear in the hearts of sinners
A sinner's heart is always in state of anxiety and terror,
because obedience to Allah ~ represents the great fortress of
Allah, so whoever enters it is safe from the Punishment of
this world and the Hereafter; but whoever leaves it would be
surrounded by all aspects of fear and worry.
A sinner's heart is always restless; he/she feels nervous
about any noise he/she hears, and believes that any
misfortune is intended for him/her. But one who fears Allah
would be spared all these worries.
Sins implant a sense of isolation in the heart. A sinner feels
secluded from his/her Lord and from other people. As
he/she commits more sins, his/her isolation increases, and so
he/she would endure the bitterness of life, as a worried
lonely person.
A sinner feels delighted when committing a sin, but this is
just a pleasure of the moment, as his/her heart is filled with
anxiety afterwards.

3

Surat Ar-Ra'd, Verse 11.

102

The secret in this matter is that obedience to Allah ~ brings
the devout person closer to Him ~. and closer to other
people that he/she loves, even if they are far away from
him/her.
Disobedience to Allah ~ attracts the feeling of remoteness
from Allah ~. and the most severe form is that of
polytheism, associating partners with Allah.

Sins draw one's heart away from righteousness
Sins take the heart from its natural state of piety to a state of
corruption and deviation. The effect of sins in the heart is
like that of diseases on the body. Sins are the ailments of the
heart, and there is no cure for the heart, except giving up
those sins.
One who stops him/her self from following his/her own
desires, his/her heart would enjoy the Grace of Allah in this
world, before reaching his/her destination in Paradise. The
Verse: (Verily, the pious believers will be in Delight, and
verily, the sinners will be in the blazing Fire) 1 is not just
limited to the Grace and the Blazing Fire of the Hereafter; it
also refers to their states in the three abodes: the abode of
this world, the abode of the Barzakh (the state of existence
during the interval from the moment a person dies to the Day
of Resurrection), and the abode of eternity; those obedient to
Allah would enjoy His Grace, whereas sinners would endure
His Punishment.
The real blessing is that which a person feels in his/her heart,
and the real punishment is that which a sinner endures in
I

SuratAI-Infitar, Verse 13-14.

103

his/her heart. There is no worse a punishment than that of
fear, depression and anxiety, which suffocate one ' s heart,
turning away from the remembrance of Allah ~ and the Last
Day.
In the Barzakh state, a sinner would suffer the punishment of
separation, and the feeling of regret about having missed out
on the Grace of Allah. The remorse and anxiety would
render his/her mind useless, until the Day when Allah ~
returns the mind to the body, ordering its resurrection. It is
then that the punishment moves to another, more bitter stage.
Those who obeyed Allah ~ in this world would have the
extreme delight of His Company, having serenity in their
hearts, being filled with the love and remembrance of Him
~ - But those who sold their priceless chance of success for
a low price should have sought the true value of their
product with people of knowledge.
It is strange that a product (life transactions) possessed by a
person should be bought by Allah ~ . for the price of
Paradise, with the Messenger of Allah ~ as the intermediary
in this trade, yet one could sell one ' s life for the lowest
price!

Allah ~ said: ( Whomsoever Allah disgraces, none can
honour him.)

Sins darken the heart
Sins blind the heart 's insight, blot out its light, and block all
means towards its right guidance.

104

When Imam Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, saw
signs of remarkable knowledge in Imam Shafi'i, he told him:
"I see that Allah ~ has cast a light upon you, so do not
extinguish it with the darkness of disobedience to Him (by
committing a misdeed)."
When a person continues to do misdeeds, the original light,
which Allah ~ had cast in his/her heart, continues to
decrease, as the darkness of sins takes over, until it
overwhelms the whole heart, and casts it in the world of
darkness; the world of self-destruction.
This darkness spreads in the limbs until it reaches the face,
turning it into a gloomy disillusioned figure.
This effect is also carried over to the Life After Death, and
adds to the darkness of the grave. The Prophet ~ said:
"These graves are filled with darkness, over its people, but
Allah sheds light on them, with my prayer upon them."
On the Day of Resurrection, all people would be gathered,
with their faces raised high and clearly seen by everyone.
The faces of sinners will be blackened, like charcoal. It is a
punishment which is not equal in weight to all the worldly
desires; so one must be patient in this world.

Sins disgrace the self
Sins disgrace the self and tum into the meanest and lowest of
all creations, just as acts of obedience to Allah ~ tum it into
the most honourable and praiseworthy; for Allah ~ said:
(Indeed, he who succeeds is he who purifies his own soul.
And indeed he who fails is he who corrupts his own

105

soul) 1 (i.e. the one who succeeds is the one who obeys and
performs all that Allah has ordered, by following the true
faith of Islamic Monotheism and by doing righteous deeds;
but the one who fails is the one who disobeys what Allah has
ordered, by rejecting the true faith of Monotheism or by
following polytheism, or by doing every kind of evil.)

A sinner conceals his/herself in his/her sins and hides;
avoiding meeting people because of his/her sinful activities.
Whereas an obedient Servant of Allah ~ feels his/herself
elevated and honoured; and this state of dignity is due to
his/her righteousness.
Sins allow a sinner to become a prisoner of the devil

A sinner is always in the grasp of Satan and his/her own
desires. He/she is detained and imprisoned by the worst
enemy of mankind. There is no narrower a prison than that
of one's base desires, and there are no more dreadful a length
of chains than that of passion.
How could such a detained and imprisoned heart tum
towards Allah and the Last Day?
When the heart is chained, all types of ailments rush towards
it from every side. The Prophet ti said: "Satan is a wolf for
mankind."
Just as an isolated sheep is at the mercy of wolves, a person
without the protection of Allah ~' is at the mercy of his/her
wolf (the devil). The Protection of Allah ~ would only
I

Surat Ash-Shams, Verse 109.

106

safeguard one when one is righteous and fearful of one's
Lord.
Divine Protection saves one from the punishment of this
world and the Hereafter.
Therefore, whenever one's heart is distant from Allah ~. it is
subjected to all sorts of ailments, and the closer it is to Allah
~. the more distant it is from all types of diseases.
Distance from Allah ~ is classified under many categories;
some of them are more serious than others:
Carelessness and negligence (of some obligations) distance
the heart from Allah ~- The distancing from Allah caused
by a sin is more serious than that caused by carelessness.
The distancing from Allah caused by innovation in religion
is more serious than that caused by a sin. But the distance
from Allah caused by hypocrisy (in religion) and polytheism
(associating partners to Allah) is the most serious of them
all.

Sins result in losing one's status before Allah and before
His Creation
The most honourable of people with Allah are those who
have "taqwa" (piety). A person's closeness to Allah ~
depends on the degree of both his/her fear of Allah and the
sincerity of his/her good deeds. When a person disobeys
Allah ~. Allah's Respect for him/her falls and then Allah ~
makes people lose all esteem in their hearts for him/her.
When he/she loses all respect from people, he/she would live
a life of disgrace, worry and sadness.

107

One of the greatest Blessings of Allah ~ upon His Servant is
to elevate his/her status among mankind. It is for this reason
that Allah ~ has assigned such attribute to His Prophets and
Messengers, as He ~ said: ( Remember Our Servants,
Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaq (Isaac), and Ya'qub (Jacob),
(all) owners of strength (in worshipping Us) and also of
religious understanding. Verily, We did choose them by
granting them (a good thing); the remembrance of the
Home (in the Hereafter; they used to make people
remember it, and used to invite people to obey Allah and
do good deeds for the Hereafter) And they are with Us,
verily, of the chosen and the best.) 1
The good thing here, also means the honourable mention that
Ibrahim :%§1 had asked Allah ~ to grant him, when he said:
( Grant me an honourable mention in later generations.) 2
Allah ~ also stated about His beloved Prophets: ( We gave
them from Our Mercy (a good provision in plenty), and
We granted them honour upon the tongues (of all
nations, that everyone should remember them with good
praise)) 3
Allah ~ also told His Prophet Muhammad ~:( ... and have
We not raised high your fame?) 4
Those who follow the teachings of the Prophets have their
share of that honour, according to the level of their
righteousness.

Sins deny sinners all words or titles of praise and honour
A sinner is always identified with despicable names. He is
denied such names as: believer, dutiful, reverent, pious,
obedient, etc. but he is labelled with names such as:
impudent, disobedient, opponent, insolent, corrupt, evil,
cursed, adulterer, thief, killer, liar, traitor, homosexual, out
cast, loner, trouble maker, etc.
Allah ~ said: (How bad is it to insult one's brother in
Islam after having faith (i.e. to address your Muslim
brother (a faithful believer) as: "0 wicked", or "O
sinner")) 5 He ~ has cursed such names of impudence
which attract His Anger and Curse.
However, good names, attract His Mercy, His Pleasure, and
entry to His Paradise. These names are granted by Allah ~
to His devoted believers. Thus, none can prevent what He
has willed to bestow, nor can anyone bestow what He has
willed to prevent.

Sins have the effect of reducing one's intellect
When you consider two people, one obedient to Allah and
the other disobedient to Allah, you will see that the intellect
of the one who is obedient to Allah is better, that his/her
opinion is sounder, and that he/she is often closer to the
truth. Therefore, you find that the Qur'an always addresses
'men of understanding': ( So fear me, 0 men of
understanding) 6 and ( So fear Allah, 0 men of

5
6

Surat Al-Hujurat, Verse 61
Surat Al-Baqarah, Verse 197.

109

understanding, in order that you may be successful.) 7 and
( But none remember, except men of understanding. ) 8
How could a person have true intellect if he/she disobeys
Allah ~ in Allah's World, knowing that He ~ is watching
over him/her? He/she commits a sin, knowing that he/she
cannot conceal himself from Allah's Sight, ignoring the fact
that he/she is inviting the Curse of Allah ~ upon him/her.
He/she knows that his/her sinful activities drive him/her
away from Allah's Pleasure and Allah's Protection. He/she
knows that he/she would be denied looking at Allah's Face
on the Day of Judgment, and would be in the company of
those who had earned Allah's Anger.
What sense of reason could there be in preferring the
satisfaction of one's own pleasure, which lasts an hour, a day
or even a year, to Everlasting Grace, in Paradise?
To live for Everlasting Grace is the happiness given to a
believer, in this world and the Hereafter.
It is not difficult for a reasonable person to realize that
attaining real pleasure, happiness and delight in this life and
the Hereafter requires that one pleases the Lord, and does not
earn His Anger nor His Curse.

A person who pleases Allah ~. by adhering to His
Commands, enjoys real pleasure in life, with a living heart
that experiences every blessing bestowed upon it. But one

7

8

Surat AI-Ma'idah, Verse 100.
Surat Al-Baqarah, Verse 269.

110

who displeases Allah ~ ' indulging in sinful activities, would
not be free of worry, anxiety or misery.
Therefore, a person who exchanges the company of those on
whom Allah has bestowed His Grace; the Prophets, the true
followers of Prophet Muhammad I;, the martyrs, and the
righteous, with those who have earned Allah's Anger and
Curse, certainly has a defective intellect.

Sins lead to severing the tie with Allah ~
When there is a rupture of relations with Allah ~, all causes
of goodness disappear, while causes of evil emerge. What
kind of life could one lead if one broke one's relations with
one's Master, Whom one cannot do without, and Who is
irreplaceable? One would simply be left as easy prey to his
arch-enemy, who would subject one to all kinds of suffering.
One past scholar said: "You see a man caught between
(obeying) Allah ~ and (obeying) Satan; if he refuses to
adhere to Allah's Commands, Satan would overpower him
and take control of his lost mind."
Allah ~ has said: ( Remember when We said to the
Angels: "Prostrate yourselves unto Adam." So they
prostrated themselves, except lblis (Satan). He was one
of the Jinn; he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will
you then take him and his offspring as protectors and
helpers rather than Me, while they are enemies of you?
What an evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.) 1

I

Surat AI-Kahf, Verse 50.

111

Allah ~ told His Servants: 'I have honoured your father
(Adam ~I), and raised his status, and preferred him to
others. I ordered My Angels to prostrate to him, as a sign of
honour to him, and they obeyed Me, except My Enemy and
his enemy (lblis). So how could you take him and his
offspring as your allies, besides Me, and how dare you obey
him and disobey Me, while he is your arch-enemy?
You have followed My enemy after I had commanded you to
take him as your enemy. You know that whoever befriends
the enemy of the King is also considered the enemy of the
King; for love and obedience cannot be fulfilled except by
manifesting enmity towards the enemies of the Obeyed
(Allah~ ), and by joining His Supporters.

Sins erase all benedictions
Sins erase many blessings in life, the blessing of livelihood:
the blessing of knowledge, the blessing of work, and the
blessing of obedience to Allah ~ In total, sins eradicate all blessings of one's religion and
one's world. The blessings of the land are eradicated only
by the sins of mankind; Allah ~ said: ( If the people of the
towns had believed and had piety, certainly, We would
have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the
earth) and He ~ also said: ( If they had believed in Allah,
and gone the Right Way, We would have bestowed on
them water in abundance, that We might try them

I

Surat Al-A ' raf, Verse 96.

112

with) 2 . Therefore a Servant of Allah is denied His Blessing
for a sin which he/she had committed.
The Prophet ~ said: "The Holy Spirit has blown in my soul
(to inform me) that no living soul would die until it has
received all its provision; so fear Allah and act well in asking
Him, for the Blessings of Allah are earned only in obeying
Him. Allah has provided mercy and joy in pleasing Him and
being certain in Him; yet He ~ made worry and sadness in
earning His Curse and being suspicious of Him. " 3
Allah ~ said, in a Hadith Qudsi, reported by the Prophet :,I:
"I am Allah. There is no god but Me. If I am pleased, I
bestow My Grace upon My Servant, and there is no limit to
My Blessings. When I am Angry, I Curse, and My Curse
reaches the seventh offspring of a person." The range of the
blessing is not in its abundance, nor is the extension of one's
life, by the addition of months or years. Rather, the comfort
of these blessings in one's life lies in Allah's Benediction of
them.
The existence of a person is manifest as the period of his/her
life, but there is no life for one who rejects the
Commandments of Allah, and was busy following his/her
own desires; the life of an animal would be better than his.
Rather, the life of a person is defined by the life of his/her
heart; and there is no life in one's heart, except by having
complete love and belief in Allah ~' worshipping Him
Alone. Whoever loses this type of life has indeed lost all

Surat Al-Jinn, Verse 16-17.
Recorded by Muslim in the book, "The Hypocrites", (Hadith 64) and
Ahmad in his Musnad (3/50).

113

goodness, even if he/she were to replace it with all pleasures
of this world.
Disobeying Allah ~ has always been a reason for the
removal of His Blessings, because Satan is associated with
people who commit sins. It is for this reason that Allah ~
commanded His believing Servants to begin every action by
mentioning the Name of Allah ~; before eating, drinking,
riding, having a sexual intercourse with one's spouse.
Mentioning the Name of Allah at the beginning of every
activity brings the Benediction of Allah ~ for His Servant,
and chases away Satan; because every action which is not
done in the Name of Allah ~ is denied any blessing from
Him ~ - All blessings come from Allah ~. and everything
related to Him is blessed; His Word is blessed, His
Messenger is blessed, His devoted pious servant is blessed,
His Sacred House (the Ka'bah) is blessed, and the land of
Palestine, within which there is Al-Aqsa mosque, is blessed.
The opposite of a blessing is a curse, so every land, person or
activity that is cursed by Allah is far from receiving any
blessing from Him ~, and anything associated with them is
definitely not blessed. Allah ~ cursed His Enemy, Iblis
(Satan), making him the most distant (from Him) of all His
Creation.
Anything linked to Satan is cursed, according to the level of
its closeness to Satan. It is from this perspective that we can
perceive the effect of sins in wiping away any blessing in
life, knowledge and activity.

114

The Prophet ~ said: "This world is cursed and so are all the
things in it, except the remembrance of Allah, those things
which He likes, scholars and students." 1
Therefore, everything in this world is cursed, except that
which is for Allah's Sake, which earns the Blessing of
Allah ~ -

Sins cast a sinner down to a very low state
Allah~ created mankind two categories: He~ made those
people who obey Him highly exalted, and made those who
disobey Him lowly degraded both in this world and the
Hereafter. He ~ also made those people who obey Him the
most honoured people, but those who reject His
Commandments the most disgraceful people.
This is
highlighted in the Hadith reported by Abdullah bin 'Amru ~
in which the Prophet ~ said: "I was sent with a sword,
before the Hour, until Allah ~ is worshipped Alone, without
associating any partners with Him. My provision was made
under the shade of my lance, and disgrace was set up on any
people who should oppose my command; and whoever
copies the manner of a people, is one of them."
Whenever a person commits a sin, he/she is cast to a lower
level, and he/she would keep on descending until he/she
reached the lowest bottom; but whenever he/she does a good
deed (obeying Allah's Commandments, and fulfilling his
obligations), he/she would keep on rising until he/she
reached the highest grades.
I

Recorded by At-Tirmidhi, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah ~ -

115

During the course of his/her life, a person might experience
ups and downs, with regards to the nature of his/her deeds
(good or bad), so he/she would be cast according to the
domination of one type over the other.
However, one should not misunderstand this statement,
because there are situations when a person might go down a
distance larger than that between the east and the west,
because of one single misdeed; therefore, even if he rises one
thousand grades up, it would not be sufficient for him; as
reported in the Hadith, in which the Prophet ~ said: "A
Servant of Allah may utter a word, without thinking whether
it is right or wrong; he may fall down into the Fire a distance
equal to that between the east and west. " 2
What kind of rising is necessary in such a situation?
Falling is inevitable in the life of man, yet there are people
whose falling is the result of a state of carelessness, so once
they come around, they quickly return to their high level, or
to an even higher one, according to the sharpness of their
wakefulness.
But there are also people whose falling is made intentionally,
when committing a sin, whether a minor or major one;
therefore, such people need a quick return to a pure and
truthful repentance.
The scholars have differed regarding the level of a person
after one repents from his sin; whether one returns to the
2

Recorded by Al-Bukhari, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah ~ . in the
book, "Ar-Riqaq", chapter 23 ; Muslim in the book, "Az-Zuhd", Hadith
50; At-Tirmidhi in the book, "Az-Zuhcf', chapter 10; and Ahmad in his
Musnad (2/ 231, 297).

116

level in which one was before committing a sin, by virtue of
the fact that repentance wipes away all traces of the sin; or
that one does not return to one's previous level, by virtue of
the fact that the effect of repentance is in cancelling the
punishment due for committing the sin; as for the level that
one missed, one would not return to it directly.
The scholars have said it is like the example of two men
climbing up two never-ending ladders. If one goes down
one step, and then carried on rising up, surely the one who
kept on ascending would always be above the other.
Shaikh Al-Islam gave an acceptable judgment regarding the
two groups, saying: "Some may return to his previous grade,
but others may not."
I say: This is according to the degree of perfection of the
repentance, and the feeling of disgrace, submission and fear
of Allah, which the sin has caused in the mind of the sinner.
These effects may influence the repentant enough to allow
him/her to reach a higher level, and even be in a better
position, after his repentance, than his/her previous position,
before committing the sin. Such a person benefits a great
deal after repenting from the sin, as it made him/her
acknowledge his/her status, and helped him/her to submit
before his/her Master, seeking His Mercy and Forgiveness,
in the most humble way possible.
Whatever blessings were bestowed upon him/her, he/she
would then regard it as being too good for him/her (i.e.
he/she is not worthily of receiving such a blessing); and
whatever misfortune had occurred to him/her, he/she would
see him/herself worthily of that affliction, because he/she

117

would admit that his/her Master had not given him/her a
punishment equal to his/her crime. In fact, the punishment
he/she deserves could not be carried by the mountains, let
alone his/her weak body.
Meeting noble people after having committed an immoral or
obscene act is very disrespectful but could lead the sinner to
a state of shame; so what about having to meet Allah, the
Supreme, Owner and Lord of the Heavens and earth?
If it were not for the fact that Allah' s Mercy precedes His
Anger, and that His Forgiveness precedes His Punishment,
the heavens and earth would have been shaken to pieces
because of the sins of His Servants.

Allah ~ has said: ( Verily, Allah grasps the heavens and
the earth lest they should move away from their places,
and if they were to move away from their places, there is
not one that could grasp them after Him. Truly, He is
Most Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.) 1
Allah ~ concluded this Verse by mentioning two of His
Attributes: The Most Forbearing, and Oft-Forgiving; and we
should understand that without His Forbearance and
Forgiveness, the heavens and the earth would not have
remained in their places.
Allah ~ has informed us about the ungrateful and
polytheistic ways of some of His Servants: ( Whereby the

I

Surat Fatir, Verse 41.

118

heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder,
and the mountains fall in ruins) 2
Allah ~ removed our forbears (Adam and Eve ~ \) from
Paradise because of the sin they had committed, in
disobeying Him. He ~ cursed Iblis (Satan) and expelled
him from the heavens and the earth, and from His Mercy,
because of the sin he committed (in not prostrating to
Adam). As for us, foolish people, we build up a mountain of
sins, and still hope to benefit from the eternal blessings in
Paradise, despite being aware of the fact that our forbears
were removed from Paradise for a single sin.
A repentant person could ascend to a better position than
when he/she was before he/she had committed a sin; but in
some cases, his/her sin could degrade him/her and weaken
his/her determination, and so the healing from his repentance
could strengthen him/her enough to regain his previous
position.
This only applies to the case where there is a descent to a
sinful level; however, if this descent is to a matter which
violates the basics of his faith, such as suspicion, doubt or
hypocrisy, then, in order to rise above this, a renewal of
one's faith (Islam) is required.

A sinner is subject to all kinds of evil from devils because
if his/her sinful life
Demons are encouraged to assault a sinner with different
kinds of suffering; by deceiving, tempting, and provoking
2

Surat Mariyam, Verse 90.

119

him/her with their devilish whispering, until he/she becomes
devoted to his/her sinful activities.
He/she would also be subjected to more harm from the devils
of mankind, who would keep on slandering him/her in
his/her presence and absence, and everyone in his/her social
life would look down upon him/her, because of his/her
despicable and shameful life.
One man once said: "When I disobey Allah, I see it in the
conduct of my wife and my animal towards me." (Even
animals change their conduct towards a sinner, until he/she
repents!)
A sinner would also be subjected to the punishment of the
ruler, who if he were just, would give the appropriate legal
punishment, ordained by Allah ~.
A sinner is guided by his/her domineering self to reach a
state of self-destruction, because he/she feels compelled to
obey its evil instructions; whereas obeying Allah ~ is the
way to enter into His Safe Fortress. Indeed, by remembering
Allah ~ ' giving Sadaqah, enjoining good and forbidding evil
one would be shielded from any evil inspiration. It is like
the immune system, resisting any invading the body.
Good deeds and misdeeds are two opposites in constant
conflict, so whenever the good side increases in power, one's
resistance becomes stronger; for Allah ~ defends those who
believe; and belief (faith) is expressed in both words and
actions. Therefore, the degree of one's resistance is given
according to the power of one's faith.

120

Sins prevent a sinner from perceiving his/her own
benefits
Everyone needs to know what benefits and what harms
him/her in this life. A person with such knowledge could
control his/her own desires, and uses this for his/her own
benefit.
Sins prevent a sinner from acqumng such knowledge,
making him/her a victim of his/her own actions.
When one falls into a sinful situation, one is completely
blinded as to a way out of it. One remains undecided, until
one is overwhelmed, because one's heart is rotten with sins,
as one's faculties of resistance do not function to save one.
When a sinner is afflicted by a misfortune, he/she becomes
deceived, by his/her heart, tongue and limbs, as to what
could save him/her from this trouble. His heart is not
attracted towards relying on Allah ~' in a state of
submission and humility; his tongue does not obey him, in
remembering his Lord, and if it helps him remembering his
Lord, his remembrance has no connection with his heart.
This is all due to the effects of sins upon the soul.
The matter is even more serious when a sinner's tongue
deceives him/her in the crucial moments before death.
Sometimes, he finds it difficult to utter the Testimony of
Faith (the declaration: la ilaha ilia Allah, Muhammad Rasul
Allah), as has been witnessed by some people in different
cases:

121

It was said to a dying person: Say: "la ilaha ilia Allah," but

instead he started mentioning the moves of a chess game which was his favourite activity - until he died.
It was said to another: Say "la ilaha ilia Allah," but he began

singing, until he died.
The same thing was said to another dying man, but he
replied: "What you say will not benefit me now, for I have
committed all types of sins." So he died without saying the
declaration of faith. Another one replied: "This would make
no difference, as I cannot even recall me performing a single
act of Salah in my life." Thus, he also died without saying it.
Another dying person replied: "I want to utter it, but my
tongue refuses."
There are many examples of such situations when some
people, in their last dying moments, were unable to utter the
declaration of faith, yet could repeat only certain words from
the activity for which they devoted their lives.
It is only in these moments that (Allah will keep firm those

who believe, with the word that stands firm in this world
and in the Hereafter. And Allah will cause to go astray
those who are wrongdoers, and Allah does what He
wills.)'
How could one's end be successful when one's heart, which
was made by Allah, remains heedless of His remembrance,
and instead follows its own lusts and desires?

1

Surat Ibrahim, Verse 27.

122

Allah ~ addresses those wrongdoers, who disregard His
Prohibitions and insist on disobeying Him: ( Or have you
oaths from Us, reaching to the Day of Resurrection, that
yours will be what you judge? Ask them, which of them
will stand surely for that!) 2

Sins blind the heart
Sins either blind the heart or weaken its insight, and
therefore, the heart misses all the available paths for its right
guidance.
Human perfection revolves around two cycles: discerning
truth from falsehood, and following the path of truth. The
disproportion of people's status, in Allah's Sight, both in this
world and the Hereafter, is based on their differences
regarding this issue. These are the issues which Allah ~
praised in His Prophets, when He ~ said: (Remember Our
Servants, Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaq (Isaac), and Ya'qub
(Jacob), all owners of strength (in worshipping us) and
also of religious understanding)3 i.e. owners of strength in
implementing the truth, and owners of good understanding
of the religion. Thus Allah ~ described them with the
excellence of their perception of and acting upon the truth.
People are divided into four categories, with regard to this
issue. The Prophets of Allah remain in the top category,
among the Creation of Allah ~The second category is totally the opposite; those who have
no insight with regards to their religion, nor strength in
execution; this category contains the majority of people.
2
3

Surat Al-Qalam, Verse 39-40.
Sad, Verse 45 .

123

Their company attracts its followers by means of shame and
disgrace.
The third category contains those with insight and an
understanding of the truth, yet are weak and unable to
execute the teachings of that truth. This is the case of the
weak believer; while the strong believer is more beloved to
Allah ~ The fourth category contains those with power and
determination, yet lacking understanding of the religion, and
failing to distinguish properly between the supporters of ArRahman (Allah ~ ), and the supporters of Shaytan (Satan).
Of all these categories, none is suitable to be assigned the
Imamah (leadership) in religion, except the first category.
Allah ~ said: ( We made from among them leaders, giving
guidance under Our Command, when they were patient
and used to believe with certainty in Our Signs) 1
Allah has sworn by time; the time of the losers and the
winners in this life; that those without iman (faith) and good
deeds are among the losers; He ~ said: (By Al-' Asr (the
time). Verily, man is in loss, except those who believe (in
Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous deeds) . Allah ~
also added: ( Recommend one another to the truth (i.e.
order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds,
which Allah has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of
sins and evil deeds, which Allah has forbidden), and
recommend one another to patience (for the suffering,
I

Surat as-Sajdah , Verse 24.

124

harm, and injury which one may encounter in Allah's
Cause).) 2
It is known that sins blind the heart's insight, preventing it
from perceiving the truth as it is, and weaken its
determination. Its perception becomes so corrupt that it
evaluates truth as falsehood and falsehood as truth.

Allah ~ said: (Whosoever turns away, blindly, from the

remembrance of the Most Gracious (Allah), We appoint
for him Satan to be a companion to him. And verily, they
(devils) hinder them from the Path of Allah, yet they
think that are guided aright! Till when he (such a one)
comes to Us, he says (to his devil companion): "Would
that between me and you were the distance of the two
easts" - the worst type of companion indeed) 3
Sins support the devils against the sinner
Sins are tools of destruction from Satan which are used
against a sinner; for Allah ~ has placed man in constant
conflict with the devil, who never leaves him alone for a
single moment. In fact, the devil can see humans clearly, but
they cannot see him, and he never sleeps nor rests, until he
corrupts them. He tries many means, including the support
from other devils from among mankind; applying many
types of stratagems and laying traps to ambush their enemy,
who is man. Satan tells other devils to attack the enemy of
their grandfather, Iblis (Satan), who was the cause of their
grandfather's expulsion from Paradise, and therefore from
the Mercy of Allah. So, he encourages them to tempt man to
2
3

Surat Al-' Asr.
Surat Az-Zukhruf, Verses 36-38.

125

commit more sins, so that many of mankind may participate
with them in their current miserable state (i.e. being expelled
from the Mercy of Allah).
Allah ~ tested the Children of Adam with Satan, yet armed
them with weapons, however He ~ also supplied their
enemy (Satan) with soldiers, in order to establish a life of
Jihad (struggle) in this world. Allah ~ has purchased from
the believers their lives and their properties, in return for an
entry into Paradise; they fight for the Sake of Allah ~; they
kill their enemy and get killed. He ~ informed us that this is
His asserted Promise in His Books: the Torah, the Bible, and
the Qur'an.
Allah ~ also said: ( 0 you who believe! Shall I guide you
to a trade that will save you from a painful torment?
That you believe in Allah and His Messenger
(Muhammad ;i) and that you strive hard and fight in the
Cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, that will
be better for you, if you but knew. (If you do so) He will
forgive you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under
which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in the Gardens
of Eden; that is indeed the great success. And also, (He
will give you) another (blessing) which you love: Help
from Allah (against your enemies) and a near victory; so
give glad tidings to the believers.) 1
Allah ~ set His Enemy (Satan) upon the believer, who is
Allah's most beloved creature, because striving for the
Cause of Allah (Jihad) is the most beloved activity in His
Sight, as people who make Jihad for the Cause of Allah, are
1

Surat as-Sa ff, Verses I 0-13.

126

the most highly elevated, and the closest to Him ~ - So, He
~ fixed the banner of Jihad in the believer's heart, the place
where there is knowledge, love, sincere worship, and
reliance on Allah ~ - Allah ~ charged the believer with his
fight against Satan, and equipped him with soldiers among
the Angels, who never leave him alone: (For him (each
believer), there are angels in succession, before and
behind him. They guard him by the Command of
Allah) 2 . The angels allow him/her to stand firm in his/her
fight, instructing him/her to do righteous deeds, and
promising him/her the Reward of Allah ~ - They tell
him/her: "Be patient for an hour, so then you may rest in
peace, eternally."
Then Allah ~ supported the believer with His Revelation
(His Own Words); so He ~ dispatched the Messenger :I and
sent down the Qur'an to consolidate other blessings
bestowed upon men, such the intellect, knowledge and faith.
Allah ~ ordered the Angels, who carry His Throne, to seek
forgiveness for the believers, to protect them from all evil,
and enter them into Paradise. He ~ will also protect them:
(It is the Party of Allah that will be successful) 3 and (It is
Our Army which will be victorious) 4
Allah ~ has taught His Servants the attributes they need in
order to wage this war, and said: ( 0 you who believe!
Endure and be more patient (than your enemy), and
guard your territory, and fear Allah, so that you may
successful.) 5

127

The matter of Jihad cannot be fulfilled except by applying
these four issues. Patience cannot be achieved except by
enduring the devil and resisting all his temptations. Once
one endures one's enemy, one needs to guard one's heart in
case the devil's whisperings entice one, and so this requires
guarding one's eyes, ears, tongue, stomach, hands and feet.
It is through these parts that the devil may enter one's heart
to corrupt it.
When the Prophet's Companions, who are the best people,
after the Prophets and Messengers, and the most protected
against Satan, left the mount which they were ordered to
guard at the Battle of Uhud, the enemy surrounded them, so
the worst thing happened to them (the loss of seventy
Companions~).
The key factor which holds together these attributes is taqwa
(fear of Allah).
Picture the scene of the two armies facing each other:
The king of the polytheists (Satan) and his soldiers
approached and found the heart of a believer, sitting in his
'kingdom', surrounded by his 'soldiers', guarding and
willing to fight for his sake. He (Satan) could not attack him
directly, so he turned to his ways of trickery and deception.
He asked who was the most special soldier for the heart.
They replied: "It is the self." So he told his aides: "Enter
upon it and find out its desires; promise to fulfil all its
wishes, and lure it towards you with all types of passionate
temptations, until it comes to your side. It is only then that
you would be able to invade all the other parts (the eyes,

128

ears, tongue, hands, and feet, etc), and remain there to
destroy its inner attributes, such as decency and modesty."
"Once in his eye openings, prevent his eyesight from being a
tool of discernment, by making them a tool of distraction and
allurement. When his eyes take an unlawful glance, make it
appear passionate and acceptable to him; for I have not
corrupted the Children of Adam with anything more than his
sight. Indeed, I plant the seed of passion in his heart, then I
water it with a wish, and keep on making promises until his
determination is strengthened. Once in control of his
passion, I help him remove his sense of decency. You have
to make him belittle his acts; tell him that staring invites you
to glorify Allah ~ (saying Subhanallah!) and reflect on the
beauty of His Creation. Tell him that Allah ~ never created
the eyes for them to be kept closed, and whatever picture
was made to be screened from people's eyesight. If the
person has little knowledge and a corrupt mind, then tell him
that every picture is an aspect of the Truth, and a reflection
of God, and so invite him to believe in 'the Unity of the
Deity with His Creatures' (the doctrine of the extremist
Sufis). If he does not accept it, make him believe in the
doctrine of 'the Incarnation of the Deity in His creatures', for
him to become a brother of the Christians."
"Then control his ear openings and prevent anything, which
might spoil your work, from entering inside, but make sure
falsehood comes through; for it acts like light on the self.
Select the sweetest and most magical words and mix them
into the selfs desires, and then place them in the ear. If you
sense a positive response, then send more similar words, but
beware of any words of Allah or His Prophet that might
infiltrate. If any of these divine words enter, you need to

129

hinder their understanding, by sending other confusing
words related to their context. In this manner, falsehood
establishes itself within the self, while the truth is regarded
as a burden; not to be considered by the masses as
important."
Allah ~ has said: (So We have appointed for every

Prophet, enemies (devils) among mankind and jinn,
inspiring one another with adorned speech as a
delusion) 1 Allah ~ named this "adornment" which is
falsehood; because the devil beautifies speech as much as he
can, injecting it into a deceived ear.
Then the devil says (to his soldiers): "Attack his tongue; it is
the greatest opening. Let it operate with self-destructive
words, preventing any beneficial words from being uttered,
such as remembering Allah, seeking His Forgiveness or
reciting His Book (the Qur'an). You have two great duties
which you should achieve now:
First, to ensure that the tongue speaks nothing but falsehood,
and you should know that whoever speaks falsehood is your
brother and a great soldier among you.
Second, to ensure the tongue keeps silent in matters of the
truth, and you should know that whoever keeps silent about
the truth is your dumb brother. Have you not heard the good
preacher among mankind say: 'The speaker of falsehood is a
speaking devil, while the (one who keeps) silent about the
truth is a dumb devil'?

I

Surat AI-An'am, Verse 112.

130

You should know that it is the tongue which has caused the
Children of Adam to be cast deeply into the Hell-Fire. You
have to help one another and lie in wait against the whole of
mankind. Have you not heard my oath when I said (to the
Lord): (Because You have sent me astray, surely, I will lie
in wait against them on Your Straight Path. Then I will
come to them from before them and behind them, from
their right and from their left, and You will not find most
of them thankful.) 1
Have you not seen that I have lied in wait against the
children of Adam on all his paths, and whenever I miss a
path, I try another one until I achieve my desire or at least
part of it?"
The Prophet ~ warned against the stratagems of the devil,
saying: "Satan has lied in wait against the son of Adam on
all his paths. He lied in wait against him on the path of
Islam, saying: 'Do you embrace Islam, leaving behind your
religion and the religion of your fathers?' The son of Adam
opposed them by embracing Islam. Satan lied in wait
against him on the path of hijrah (emigration for the Cause
of Allah,) saying: 'Do you emigrate, leaving your land?' But,
the son of Adam opposed him by emigrating. Satan lied in
wait against him on the path of Jihad, saying: 'Do you make
jihad and die, so that your wealth would be divided and your
wife would be remarried?"' 2

131

Then the devil gives his order (to his soldiers) to attack his
hands and feet and prevent them from doing any damaging
your work - such as enjoining good and forbidding evil.

Sins make the sinner neglect himself
When a person neglects his/her own soul, he/she corrupts it
and destroys it.

If it is said: "How can a person neglect or forget his/her own
soul? And if he/she forgets him/herself, what does he/she
remember? What is the meaning of forgetting oneself?"
The answer is: "Yes, a person can seriously forget his/her
own soul. Allah ~ said: ( Do not be like those who forgot

Allah (i.e. became disobedient to Allah), and He caused
them to forget themselves. Those are rebellious to
Allah) 1; when they forgot their Lord, He ~ forgot them and
made them forget their own souls, as He ~ also said: (The
hypocrites, men and women, are one from another; they
enjoin (on people) Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelieve and
polytheism of every kind and all that Islam has
forbidden), and forbid Al-Ma 'ruf (Islamic Monotheism
and all that Islam orders one to do), and they close their
hands (to giving alms). They have forgotten Allah and so
Allah has forgotten them. Verily the hypocrites are
Fasiqun (rebellious to Allah).) 2

2

Surat Al-Hashr, Verse 19.
Surat at-Tawbah, Verse 67.

132

Allah ~ forgets such Servants, by neglecting them and
leaving them without any support, which results in their
imminent destruction.
As for one's forgetfulness of oneself, it is the wasting of
one's chances of happiness and success.
Allah ~ makes these people forget their self-defects and
shortcomings, and their thoughts of removing them. He ~
also makes them forget the diseases and pains in their hearts
and souls, which is one of the severest punishments from
Allah ~There is no greater punishment that forgetting oneself;
neglecting the benefits and solutions, causes of happiness
and refinement, and preparation for the blessed eternal life.
Whoever reflects on this issue would discover that most of
people have truly forgotten themselves and wasted their
opportunities with Allah ~ - They have sold themselves
cheaply, for the sake of base worldly desires. However, it is
in their dying moments that they become aware of their loss,
and it is only on the Day of Mutual Loss and Gain (atTaghabun) that a Servant of Allah is faced with the result of
the pledge he/she had committed to him/herself in this
world; for every person trades in this world for the Hereafter.
The losers would be those who bought this worldly life for
their chance in the Hereafter; they indulged in satisfying
their lowly desires and were fully committed to the
achievement of that end, saying: "Take what you see but
leave what you (simply) hear about."

133

This is due to the weakness of their faith and their strong
urge to fulfil their worldly desires. Allah ~ has said about
such people: (Those are they who have bought the life of
this world at the price of the Hereafter. Their torment
shall not be lightened nor shall they be helped) 3 and He ~
also said about them: (So their commerce was profitless,
and they were not guided.) 4
The winners are those who sold the ending with the
everlasting, the mean with the priceless, the despicable with
the great. They said: "What is the value of this world, from
its beginning to its end, that we should sell our chance with
Allah ~ and the Hereafter for it? What could possibly could
a Servant of Allah earn in it, when in reality its time is as
brief as a short nap? Allah~ said:
( On the Day when He shall gather them together, (it will
be) as if they had not stayed (in the life of this world and
the graves) but an hour of a day)'

(They ask you about the hour - when its appointed time
will be. You have no knowledge to say anything about it.
To your Lord belongs (the knowledge of) the term
thereof. You are only a warner for those who fear it. The
Day they see it, (it will be) as if they had not tarried (in
this world) except an afternoon or a morning) 2

(On the Day when they will see that (torment) which they
are promised as if they had not stayed more than an hour

(He (Allah) will say: "What number of years did you stay
on earth?" They will say: "We stayed a day or part of a
day. Ask of those who keep account." He (Allah) will
say: "You stayed not but a little, if you had only
known!") 4

(The Day when the Trumpet will be blown: that day, We
shall gather the Mujrimun (Polytheists, sinners,
disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) blue or blind-eyed
with thirst. They will speak in a very low voice to each
other (saying): "You stayed no longer than ten (days)."
We know very well what they will say, when the best
among them in knowledge and wisdom will say: "You
stayed no longer than a day!") 5
The winners are, therefore, those who realise that the eternal
world of the Hereafter, is the one they should strive to
achieve. Indeed, every person views his/her own self in this
life; some safeguard it and others destroy it, for Allah ~
said: (Verily, Allah has purchased from the believers
their lives and their properties for (the price) that theirs
shall be Paradise. They fight in the Cause of Allah, so
they kill and are killed. It is a promise, in truth, which is
binding on Him in the Torah, Injeel (Gospel) and Qur'an;
and who is truer to his covenant than Allah? Then rejoice

supreme success.)6
If you are interested in this trade, then give this price (be one

of) ( those who turn to Allah in repentance, worship Him,
praise Him, fast, bow down (in prayer), prostrate
themselves (in prayer), enjoin (on people) Al-Ma'ruf (i.e.
Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained) and
forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism of all that
Islam has forbidden), and observe the limits of Allah, and
give glad tidings to the believers.) 7
Sins remove present blessings and block incoming
blessings
The presence of Allah's Blessings is preserved by
observance of His Commands; for every aspect of
Graciousness is earned by obeying Him ~Allah ~ has produced a cause behind and an obstacle to
everything: a cause to enhance it, and an obstacle to cancel
it. So He ~ made the reason for attracting His Blessings the
performance of the Islamic obligations, but made the
objection to receiving His Blessings the rejection or
negligence of those obligations.

Sins keep the sinner away from the angel appointed to
him
A sinner cannot get any help from his protector (the
appointed angel) because he is kept far away from his Lord,

Surat at-Tawbah, Verse 111.

136

according to the nature of his sin. Even a single lie may
keep him/her a great distance from his/her angel, and so
he/she is at the mercy of his arch enemy (Satan). The
Prophet ~ said: "When a man lies, the angel moves a mile
from him due to the bad odour of what he had produced." 1
Allah~ said: (Verily, those who say: "Our Lord is Allah
(Alone)," and then they stand firm, on them the angels
will descend (at the time of their death) (saying): "Do not
fear, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of Paradise
which you have been promised! We have been your
friends of this world and are so in the Hereafter ... ") 2
When his Lord supports him, the best and most beneficial of
Allah's Creation would also support him; Allah ~ said:
(Remember when your Lord revealed to the angels:
"Verily, I am with you so keep firm, those who have
believed ... ") 3
There is nothing ever more beneficial to the believer than the
company of an angel, who is his/her supporter during his/her
life and death, in his/her grave of isolation. He repels his
enemy (Satan) from him, and promises him glad tidings, and
urges him to keep believing in the truth. The Prophet ~ said:
"Satan exercises his influence upon the son of Adam, as does
an angel. The influence of Satan is that he the promise of
evil and denial of truth. And the influence of the angel is that
he gives the promise of good and the affirmation of truth.

Allah but he who finds other than it, should seek refuge in
Allah from Satan, the accursed. " 4
When the angel is much closer to the Servant of Allah, he
places the right words in his tongue, but when he is far from
him, the devil speaks to his tongue. The Prophet ji; said:
"Allah has placed truthfulness in Umar's tongue and he
utters it. " 5
Sins keep the son of Adam away from his appointed angel,
whose company and support would otherwise have brought
him happiness. The angel defends the Servant of Allah and
replies to anyone who abuses him. It was reported by Abu
Hurayrah that two men had a dispute in the presence of the
Messenger of Allah ~- While one of them abused the other,
the Prophet kept watching and smiling. When the other
responded to the abuse, the Prophet ji; got up and left. So the
man caught up with the Prophet and commented: "He was
reviling me while you were sitting, but when I replied to
some of what he had said you became angry, got up and
went away." The Prophet ji; replied: "There was an angel
with you replying to him, but when you replied to him a
devil descended."
Some Companions said: "There are (also) those (angels)
with you who do not leave you, so be aware of them and
honour them."

Allah ~ said: (But verily, there are angels appointed over
you, in charge of mankind, to watch you; honourable,
writing down your deeds)6 i.e. be aware of those
honourable appointed angels, and beware of exposing them
to anything which you regard as too shameful among you.
The angels are harmed by anything that may harm the
Children of Adam.

Legal Islamic punishment
If the aforementioned punishments do not scare you, then
take a look at the legal punishment, legislated by Allah ~
and His Messenger ~ regarding committing crimes:
Cutting off the hand of the thief of three dirhams.
Cutting off the hands and feet of highway thieves who attack
those people whose blood and property are forbidden to
violate.
Flogging a person for abusing another innocent Muslim, or
for drinking wine.
Stoning to death, as a most horrific capital punishment, for
having an illegal sexual intercourse (if the culprit is married).
If the culprit is not married, the punishment is one hundred
lashes and exile from his land for a year.
Capital punishment (Killing by beheading) for:
Having a sexual intercourse with a person one cannot legally
be married to.

Surat AI-Infitar, Verses 10-12.

Refusing to perform the prescribed Salah
Uttering the word of kufr (polytheism)
Performing homosexual acts, or performing a sexual act with
animals (killing both parties engaged in such acts).
And any other punishment which came in accordance with
the nature the crime, in terms of its law of equality (Qasas)
and as a deterent.

Punishments of sins are either legislated or divinely
decreed by Allah ~
All punishments are in response to sins committed by a
person, and these punishments are either given according to
Islamic legislations or Divine Decree.
If the legislated Islamic punishments (Qasas) are
implemented for a particular crime, then the divinely decreed
punishment would be cancelled or reduced for the person
who had committed the crime. Allah ~ does not allow both
punishments for His Servant, except if one of them was not
sufficient to remove the sin or its ailment.
If the legislated Islamic punishment is not implemented (i.e.
in the case where the ruler does not govern by the Laws of
Allah), the Divinely Decreed Punishment takes place; it
could either be more or less punishing than the legislated
one.
However, the Divinely Decreed Punishments are general, in
the sense that a whole village could be punished if a group of

140

people spread immorality, while the rest did not enjoin good
nor forbid evil from spreading in their society.
The legislated sentence is the punishment for the doer of the
crime alone, whereas the Divinely Decreed Punishment is
wide-ranging, as it covers both those who commit evil and
those who try to remove it.
Allah ~ has defined a legislated punishment for each crime,
according to its gravity. The sentences are: killing, cutting
(off the hands), flogging. He ~ decreed punishment by
killing for the crime of polytheism, adultery and
homosexuality, because the first corrupts the religion, the
second corrupts the lineage (kinship) and the third corrupts
the nature of man.
Imam Ahmad said: "After the crime of murder, I do not
know a more serious crime than adultery", and he supported
his statement with the Hadith oflbn Mas'ud 4l,§, who said that
a man said: "O Messenger of Allah, which sin is the biggest
in Allah's Sight?" The Prophet~ said: "To set up rivals unto
Allah, though He Alone created you." That man asked:
"What is next?" The Prophet ~ replied: "To kill your son
lest he should share your food with you." The man said:
"What is next?" The Prophet ~ said: "To commit illegal
sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbour." Then
Allah revealed, in confirmation of that: ( ... those who
invoke not with Allah any other god, nor kill such life as
Allah has made sacred except for a just cause, nor
commit illegal sexual intercourse, for whoever does this
shall receive the punishment... ) 1
I

Surat Al-Furqan, Verse 68.

141

The Prophet ~ mentioned examples of each type of these
most serious crimes:
The most serious type of polytheism is to associate another
god with Allah ~ The most serious type of killing is to kill one's child for fear
that the child might share one's food and drink.
The most serious type of fornication is to commit adultery
with one's neighbour's wife.
The adultery with a married woman is graver, in terms of its
sin and punishment, than with a non-married woman,
because it includes the violation of the sanctity of the
husband and his intimate relationship with his wife, and it
corrupts his lineage.
Committing fornication with a hundred unmarried women is
less, in the Sight of Allah, than committing fornication with
the neighbour's wife, for such an act is also a violation of the
rights of neighbourhood.
The Prophet ~ said: "He does not enter Paradise one who
does not save his neighbour from one's evils"2 and there is
no greater evil than having a sexual intercourse with the
neighbour' s wife; therefore the punishment mcreases
according to the seriousness of the crime.

The Divinely Decreed Punishment comes in two forms: a
punishment to one's heart and soul, and a punishment to
one's body and property.
The punishment to the heart also comes in two forms: first,
as pains which affect the heart; second, the withholding of
substances which give life and refinement of the heart. The
punishment to the heart is the severest of all punishments
because it is basically a punishment of the whole body.
This type of punishment progresses and intensifies, moving
from the heart to the rest of the body, just as body pains may
move to the heart. When the soul is separated from the
body, the punishment remains within the body, and is known
as the punishment in the grave.
The punishment to the body also comes in two forms: a
punishment in this world, and another in the Hereafter. Its
severity and intensity depends upon the consequences of the
crimes. There is no basis for evil in this world and the
Hereafter except the sins and their punishment. Evil
originates from the self and its misdeeds, against which the
Prophet ~ used to seek refuge in Allah, saying: "We seek
refuge in You (Allah) from the evil within ourselves, and
from the evil of our deeds."
Seeking refuge in Allah is done against all evil; the evil of
the self becomes manifested as evil deeds, which in their
tum necessitate the appropriate punishments. The angels
invoke the Mercy of Allah ~ for the believers, saying:
("Save them from (the punishment of what they did ot)
sins, and whomsoever You save from (the punishment of

143

what he did of) sins (i.e. pardon him) that day, him
verily, You have taken into mercy") 3
This Verse informs us of the angels' praise for the believers
and their benevolence towards them, by seeking their
forgiveness.
The angels ask Allah ~ with His Vast
Measureless Knowledge and Mercy to save the believers
from punishment. Allah ~ is All-Aware of their sins and
their causes, and also of their weakness before their arch
enemy (Satan). Allah ~ is All-Aware of His Servants,
whom He ~ created from the earth, and when they were in
the form of embryos in their mothers' wombs. He ~ knew
that they were going to disobey Him sometime in their lives,
but He ~ ·loves to pardon and forgive.
The angels invoke Allah ~ for the believers to enter
Paradise, which He has promised them, and say: (You are
the Almighty, the All-Wise) 1 i.e. the Source and the Cause
of all that comes from the Perfection of Allah's Ability and
His Knowledge; for might is the perfection of ability, and
wisdom is the perfection of knowledge.
With these Attributes, Allah ~ decrees, commands, forbids,
compensates and punishes whomsoever He ~ wishes; the
basis of Allah's Creation and Commands are founded upon
these two Attributes.

Punishments which Allah ~ has assigned for sins
Think of the punishments which Allah ~ has decreed for

This would certainly make you reconsider before committing
any sm.
Among the Punishments of Allah ~ are: sealing one's heart
and ears, keeping a screen over one's eyesight, locking up
one's heart, overturning one's heart and eyesight; making
one's heart heedless of remembering Allah ~; the straying
of one's heart away from the truth, and causing it to relapse.
Indeed Allah ~ has said: ( Verily, it is not the eyes that
grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts
that grow blind.) 2 This is not the perceptible blindness of
the eyes, but is rather, in reality, the complete blindness of
the heart, which prevents it from perceiving the truth. (Allah
forbid!)
Allah ~ also punishes the sinner's heart by sinking it down
to the lowest levels, without the sinner's awareness. He ~
turns the nature of such a heart into that of an animal,
whereby the sinner acquires certain traits and characteristics
of animals. This was the interpretation of Sufyan bin
'Uyaynah of the Verse: (There is not a moving creature on
the earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are
communities like you) 3 . He said: "Some of them assume
the usual characteristics of lions, some of dogs, while others
of pigs or donkeys, and so on." Allah ~ has likened
ignorant (Muslim) people to donkeys, dogs or camels in
different Verses of the Qur'an.
Allah ~ screens the hearts of sinners from remembering
their Lord in this world, and will screen Himself from them

on the Day of Resurrection, as He ~ said: (Nay! But on
their hearts is the covering of sins and evil deeds, which
they used to earn. Nay! Surely, they (the evildoers) will
be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.) 4
Allah ~ punishes the sinner by turning his/her life into a
cycle of hardship and distress in this world, in the grave and
in the Hereafter. He ~ said: (But whoever turns away
from My Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Qur'an
nor acts on its teachings), verily, for him is a life of
hardship, and We shall raise him up blind on the Day of
Resurrection.) 5 A life of hardship was interpreted as the
punishment in the grave, but this Verse provides a more
general meaning, in this context. In fact, Allah ~ punishes
whoever turns away from His Reminder with a life of
hardship and anxiety, even if he/she happens to be enjoying
the blessings of this world, as his/her heart was suffering
from the destructive symptoms of feeling isolation and
disgrace, and having false desires.
The heart and soul never feel serene unless they remember
Allah ~. as He Alone is worthy of worship. Allah ~ grants
a good life to whoever believes in Him and does righteous
deeds; He ~ said: (Whoever works righteousness whether male or female - while he (or she) is a true
believer (of Islamic Monotheism) verily, to him We will
give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment
and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a

(i.e. paradise in the Hereafter) 1
Allah ~ has guaranteed for those people who believe and do
righteous deeds, a good life in this world and a good
compensation in the Hereafter; they are indeed truly alive in
both worlds.
He ~ also said: (For those who do good in this world,
there is good, and the home of the Hereafter will be
better; and excellent indeed will be the home of the
pious) 2 and (Seek forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to
Him in repentance, that He may grant you good
enjoyment for a term appointed, and bestow His
Abounding Grace to every owner of grace) 3
One of those who had tasted this grace said: "In this world
there is a paradise like the one in the Hereafter; whoever
enters it, has entered the Real Paradise, but whoever does not
enter it, has not entered the Paradise in the Hereafter." The
Prophet ~ had mentioned this Paradise, saying: "When you
come upon the Pastures of Paradise feed on them." On being
asked what the Pastures of Paradise were, he ~ replied that
they were circles where Allah was remembered." 4

rather the first group are enjoying the grace in the three
worlds; while the second group are suffering the punishment
in the three worlds.
There is no better grace in this world than that of having
righteousness of the heart and soundness of the heart, along
with knowledge of Allah ~' and devotion towards Him ~Allah ~ praised Prophet Ibrahim ~ I saying: (Verily among

those who followed his (Noah's) way was Ibrahim, when
he came with a pure heart) 6
A pure heart is that which is free of polytheism, hatred,
miserliness and pride; that is free from any ailment, which
might prevent one from devoting one's worship to Allah ~
Alone.
The purity of the heart is accomplished when it is free of five
things: polytheism, which contradicts the concept of the
Oneness of Allah ~; innovation in religion, which
contradicts the Sunnah of the Prophet ti; desire, which
contradicts the Commandments of Allah i!M;; heedlessness,
which contradicts the Remembrance of Allah ~; and
passion, which contradicts sincerity.
These five aspects are a cover from Allah ~' and each of
them is branched into many more elements. Therefore, the
Servant of Allah is desperately needs to ask Allah ~ to guide
him/her to the Right Path, in terms of theory, practice and
willpower. He/she may know the details of the Right Path,

Surat Al-Infitar, Verse 13-14.
Surat as-Saffat, Verse 83-84.

148

yet may ignore them; and whatever he/she knows, he/she
may or may not be able to implement.
Allah ~ guides to the Right Path by His Divine Decree,
Commandments and Prohibitions. He ~ guides to His Right
Path whomsoever He wishes, by His Mercy and
Graciousness. But He ~ also removes from His Right Path,
whomsoever He wishes, by His Justice and Wisdom.
Allah ~ has prepared the Right Path for His Servants, and
invited them to it as evidence from Him and a justice. He ~
has guided whomsoever He wants among them to take the
Right Path as a blessing from Him.
On the Day of Resurrection, Allah ~ will set up the Right
Path for His Servants, which will take them to Paradise. He
~ will draw away from it whomsoever turned away from
His Commandments in this world, but will help whoever
observed His Commandments in this world to cross the Path.
He ~ will grant those who believe in Him and His
Messenger a light, which would shine ahead of them, and in
their right hands, in the darkness of the Day of Gathering.
You can picture the Day of Judgment before your eyes, and
think of the Wisdom of Allah ~ in the two worlds, and then
you come to the certainty that this world is but a land to be
cultivated for the Hereafter. The status of people, with
regards to their degree of happiness or misery, depends on
the strength, of their belief in Allah and their performance of
righteous deeds, in this world.

149

Therefore, one of the greatest punishments for sins is the
deviation from the Right Path, in this world and the
Hereafter.

The degree of punishment differs according to the type of
sin and its effect of corruption
A sin can be defined in two ways: turning away from a
Commandment of Allah, or committing a prohibited deed.
Allah ~ had put on trial the father of the jinn and that of
mankind for committing these two sins, which are divided
into four categories:
(1) Kingly sins: when a person assumes some godly
attributes, such as greatness, pride, omnipotence,
subjugation, highness, exaltedness, etc. he falls into
polytheism, by associating himself with Allah ~This type is the most serious sin of all, because one
tries to compete with Allah in His Attributes and His
Sovereignty, which is unforgivable. Allah ~ said:
(Verily, Allah does not forgive that partners
should be set up with Him (in worship), but He
forgives (anything else) except that, to whom He
wills, and whoever sets up partners with Allah in
worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous
sin) 1
(2) Devilish sins: when a person imitates the devil with
his attributes, such as envy, oppression, cheating,
treason, enjoining misdeeds, forbidding righteous
deeds, innovating in religion, inviting people to
misguidance.

1

Surat an-Nisa', Verse 48.

150

(3) Predatory sins: when a person becomes a tyrant and
acts oppressively towards other weak people,
inflicting them with harm and suffering.
(4) Animalistic sins: when a person becomes possessed
by his passion for lust, which leads to adultery and
immorality. This type of sin is the most common
among people as they are unable to assume those
kingly or predatory attributes. However, it is through
this type that they aim to acquire recognition for
possessing those other attributes, from the predatory
to the devilish, then even trying to compete with
Allah ~ in His Divinity and Oneness.

Major and minor sins
The Qur'an, Sunnah and consensus of Companions and
Scholars have determined what constitutes a major or minor
sin. Allah ~ said: (If you avoid the great sins which you
are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you Your
small sins, and admit you to a noble entrance (i.e.
Paradise))' and (Those who avoid great sins and
fawahish (illegal sexual intercourse), except the small
faults. Verily, your Lord is of Vast Forgiveness.) 2
The Prophet :_;i said: "The Five (daily) prayers, and from one
Friday Prayer to (the next) Friday Prayer is an expiation (of
the sins committed in between them), if major sins are not
committed. " 3

Recorded by Muslim in the "Book of Purification", Hadith 16, and
Ahmad in his Musnad (2/400).

151

These expiating deeds have three degrees:
First, they are confined to expiating small sins, because of
their weakness and the weakness in the sincerity of the deeds
(i.e. not implemented with utmost devotion because of some
slackness in the performance), and so they act like weak
medicine, which is not very effective in resisting the ailment.
Second, they resist small sins, and are not able to reach the
level of resisting great sins.
Third, they are powerful enough to expiate small sins and
still possess some power to expiate some great sins.
The Prophet ·~ said: "Shall I not inform you of the biggest of
the great sins?" They said: "Yes, 0 Messenger of Allah" He
~ said: "To join partners in worship with Allah; to be
undutiful to one's parents, to give a forged statement and a
false witness." 4
The Prophet ~ said: "Avoid the seven great destructive
sins." They (the people) asked: "O Messenger of Allah!
What are they?" He :i said: "Joining partners in worship
with Allah; practicing sorcery; killing a life which Allah has
forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islamic law);
eating up usury (Riha), eating up the property of an orphan;
turning one's back to the enemy and fleeing from the
battlefield, at a time of fighting; and accusing chaste women,

who never even think of anything except chastity and are
good believers." 5
Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~ said: "I asked the Prophet ~ : ' What
is the greatest sin in the Sight of Allah?' He ~ replied: 'That
you set up a rival unto Allah, though He Alone created you.'
I said: 'That is indeed a great sin.' Then asked: 'What is
next?' He ~ said: 'To kill your son, lest he should share your
food with you.' I asked: 'What is next?' He ~ said: 'To
commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your
neighbour' 1 so Allah ~ sent down: ( •.. and those who
invoke not with Allah any other god, nor kill such life as
Allah has made sacred except for a just cause, nor
commit illegal sexual intercourse)2"
The scholars have differed over the number of the great sins:
Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~ stated: "There are four." Abdullah
bin Umar ~ stated: "There are seven." Abdullah bin Amru
bin Al- ' As stated: "There are nine." Others have said:
"There are eleven, or even seventy . .. "

(Punishment).
Four of the tongue: g1vmg false witness; accusing chaste
believing women; making calamitous vows; practicing
sorcery.
Three of the stomach: Drinking wine (alcoholic drinks);
consuming an orphan's property; consuming usury.
Two of the private parts: committing adultery; committing
homosexual acts.
Two of the hands: killing unlawfully; stealing another's
property.
One of the feet: running away from the battlefield.
One of all the body: being undutiful to one's parents."
Those scholars who did not categorize great sins have said:
"Great sins are everything forbidden by Allah ~ in the
Qur' an; while small sins are those forbidden by the
Prophet ~ -"
Others have said: "Any act which is ordained to be punished
in this world or in the Hereafter is a great sin, and that which
is not followed by a punishment defined in the Law of
Equality, for example, is regarded as a small sin."
Others have also said: "Whatever act, resulting in Allah and
His Messenger cursing its performer, is a great sin."

154

It was also said: "A great sin is everything mentioned from
the beginning of Surat an-Nisa' until the Verse: (If you

avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We
shall expiate from you your (small) sins)3"
Those who did not divide sins into small and great ones have
said: "All sins - considering the fact of boldly disobeying
Allah and rejecting His Commands - are great sins." They
justify their statement with the fact that Allah ~ is not
harmed by the sins of His servants, whether they are small or
great; they are all acts of disobedience to Hirn, and He ~ is
not affected by them.
They have said that a person should not look at the smallness
or the greatness of the sin, in himself, but should consider
the Worthiness and the Greatness of his Lord, whom he has
disobeyed.

Worshipping Allah• Alone
Allah ~ sent His Messengers, sent down His Revelation, and
created the heavens and the earth in order to be worshipped,
Alone. Allah ~ wants all obedience and invitations of
worship to be directed to Hirn ~. as He ~ is the One God,
Who owns all things. Allah ~ has said:
(I (Allah) did not create the jinn and mankind except
that they should worship Me (Alone)) 1

I

Surat an-Nisa', Verse 31.

(It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the
earth the like thereof. His Command descends between
them, that you may know that Allah has power over all
things, and that Allah surrounds all things in (His)
Knowledge.) 3

( Allah has made the Ka'bah, the Sacred House, an
asylum of security and benefits for mankind, and also the
Sacred Month and the animals of offerings and the
garlanded, that you may know that Allah has knowledge
of all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth; and
Allah is the All-Knower of all things.) 4
So Allah ~ has informed us that the purpose of His Creation
and Command is: that He should be known through His
Names and Attributes, and that He, Alone, should be
worshipped, without associating any partner with Him. He
~ wants people to act fairly among themselves, as this
fairness is the justice upon which the heavens and the earth
were established; He ~ said: (Indeed, We have sent Our
Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the
Scripture and the Balance Gustice) that mankind may
keep up justice) 5 The highest example of justice is
Monotheism (Worshipping Allah, Alone), while the greatest
act of injustice is polytheism, being the greatest of the major
sms.

One should reflect well on this foundation, and know its
details, in order to learn the wisdom of the Best of Judges
(Allah ~ ), in everything that He has Commanded to do as
well as everything He forbade.
The basis of Shirk (polytheism) is certainly the opposite of
Tawhid (Monotheism), and therefore Shirk is defined as the
greatest of the major sins. Consequently, Allah ~ has
forbidden the entry of every polytheist to Paradise. He ~
has legalised, for the Muslims, the blood, property and
family of a polytheist, and they may even be taken as slaves.
This is because they have rejected the Command of Allah ~
to worship Him, Alone.
He ~ does not accept any of the deeds of polytheists, nor
does He accept any intercession from them. He ~ will not
answer their supplications in the Hereafter, because they
were the most ignorant of Him ~' as they associated
partners with Him, which was the worst act of injustice on
their part, even though they were simply acting unjustly
towards themselves.

Types of polytheism
There is a case where a polytheist claims that he/she only
intends to honour the Majesty of God, believing that the
Greatness of God requires that he should enter upon Him
through mediators, just like visiting a king or president. The
polytheist, in this case, believes that he/she should not offend
the Honour of the Deity, but dignify Him, instead. Say: "I
worship these mediators to get closer to God and enter His
Presence; so, why does this Divine Decree bring His Anger
and Curse upon me; sentencing me to live eternally in the

157

Hell-Fire, in the Hereafter, legalising my killing, and the
possession of my family and property?"
Another question results from the above question:
Is it possible that Allah ~ could legislate for His Servants to
approach Him through mediators and intercessors, as its
forbiddance may be understood from Islamic legislation, or
is it that such acts are also rejected by human nature and
reason, and so Shari' ah should not allow it?
What is the secret to the fact that Allah ~ does not forgive
any form of polytheism, among all sins, for He ~ said:

(Verily, Allah does not forgive that partners should be
set up with Hirn (in worship), but He forgives anything
else, for whom He wills) 1?
Consider this question well, and you will come to realise the
difference between polytheists and monotheists; you will
distinguish those who know Allah ~ from those who ignore
Him; the people of Paradise from the people of the Hell-Fire.
With the Success of Allah ~' Who Alone guides His
Servants to the Right Path, I say:
There are two types of polytheism:
( 1) That which is related to God's Attributes, Names and
Actions.
(2) That which is related to worshipping Him and
conducting oneself towards Him, even though in
some cases, a person may still believe that God is
Alone, having no partners to share His Attributes,
Names and Actions with.

Surat an-Nisa', Verse 48.

The first type of polytheism is also divided to two types:

First, a type of polytheism called "ta 'teef' i.e. a concept
which denies God all His Attributes, like the case of
Pharaoh, who said: (and what is the Lord of the 'Alamin
(mankind, jinn and all that exists)?) 2 . Allah ~ has also
informed us about the polytheism of Pharaoh, saying:
(Pharaoh said: "0 Haman! Build me a tower that I may
arrive at the ways - the ways of the heavens, and I may
look on Musa's God." Truly, I think he is a liar.) 3
This theological concept denies God His Supremacy,
Perfection and Omnipotence over His Creation. It denies the
purpose of a servant his/her pure existence, which is to
establish Islamic Monotheism (worshipping Allah~ Alone).

Second, a type of polytheism is of those who associate
partners with Allah ~. without denying Him His Names or
Godship, like the polytheism of the Christians who consider
God as the third of the three (in a Trinity), with the Messiah
as a god, and his mother (and/or the Holy Spirit) as a god.
There is also the polytheism of the Magi (Zoroastrians) who
relate all good events to light, and all bad events to darkness.
There are indeed many polytheist sects in this context, like
Al-Qadariyah, which is another theological school of early
Islam, who assert man's freewill, and deny the Will of Allah
in the actions of His Creation; the Sabians follow astrology,
worshipping stars and planets, believing that they are
managing the affairs of this world, etc ...

Surat Ash-Shu'ara', Verse 23.
Surat Ghafir, Verse 36-37.

159

Another aspect of polytheism is in worship
This aspect is less serious, because it is manifested in the
actions of those who believe that there is no god worthy of
worship but Allah ~. and that no one can harm or benefit
someone, or give or remove something, except Allah ~.
Alone; however not all their actions are devoted entirely to
Allah ~- Their actions are divided between Allah ~.
themselves, the devil and other people. This is the case of
the majority of people, and is the polytheism mentioned by
the Prophet ~ in the Hadith: "Polytheism in this Ummah is
more hidden than the creeping of ants." They asked: "How
do we save ourselves from it, 0 Messenger of Allah?" He ~
replied: "Say: 0 Allah, I seek refuge in You that I should
associate anything (in worship) besides You, knowingly; and
I seek Your Forgiveness for what is beyond my
knowledge." 1
Allah ~ said: ( Say: I am only a man like you. It has been
revealed to me that your God is One God (i.e. Allah). So
whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him
work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the
worship of his Lord) 2 i.e. just as He ~ is the only God and
there is no other god but Him, then likewise one's worship
should be devoted to Him, Alone.
The polytheism in one's worship of Allah ~ cancels one's
reward from Allah ~. and one may even be punished for any
act which is not performed for the Sake of Allah ~ .
especially if it is an obligation (religious duty). Allah ~
1

Recorded by Ibn Hibban.
Surat Al-Kahf, Verse 110.

160

commanded that all of one's worship should be performed
sincerely for Him, Alone; He ~ said: ( They were only
ordered to worship Allah, making their religion sincerely
His) 3 . Therefore, whoever is not sincere in his/her worship
of Allah has certainly not acted according to the Command
of Allah.
Allah ~ said: "I am so Self-Sufficient that I am in no need of
having an associate. Thus he who does an action for
someone else's sake as well as Mine will have that action
renounced by Me to him whom he associated with Me." 4
One commits polytheism by devoting one's love and honour
to other creations, just as much as one loves Allah. This type
of polytheism is unforgivable, because Allah has ~ said:
( There are of mankind some who take (for worship)
others besides Allah as rivals. They love them as they
love Allah; but those who believe, love Allah more) 5 . The
people who adopt this kind of polytheism say to their gods,
as they are gathered in the Hell-Fire: ( By Allah, we were
truly in a manifest error. We held you (the false gods) as
equals (in worship) with the Lord of the 'Alamin
(mankind,jinn and all that exists)) 6

Polytheism in people's words and actions
Some people fall into polytheism when their words,
intentions and actions are devoted to other false gods,
besides Allah ~ 3

Polytheism in actions is manifested in their prostration to
others besides Allah, making circumambulation for others
besides Allah, kissing other stones, apart from the Black
Stone in the Ka'bah (the Haram mosque in Makkah), kissing
graves and prostrating to them seeking the blessings of the
dead. The Prophet ~ cursed those taking the graves of
prophets and pious people as mosques, to perform Salat
there; so what about those who take graves as places of idol
worship, besides Allah ~ ?
The Prophet ~ said:
"Allah cursed the Jews and the Christians because they took
the graves of their prophets as places for praying." 1
"Among the most evil people, to whom the Hour will come
while they are still alive, are those who take their graves as
mosques." 2
"The anger on those who took the graves of their Prophets as
places of prostration was terrible."3

they would build a place of worship at his grave and make

sight of Allah on the Day of Resurrection.',4
This is the case of one who prostrated to Allah at a grave; so
what about the one who prostrated to the grave itself? The
Prophet ~ said: "O Allah! Do not make my grave an idol
that is worshipped." 5
The Prophet ~ strongly and vigorously protected
Monotheism, and so he ~ forbade performing optional Salat,
to worship Allah ~ . at the time of the rising or setting of the
sun, to prevent it from becoming an act of imitation of those
who worship the sun, at those particular times.
The Prophet ~ said: "No one should prostrate to anything
except Allah '.m.''6
Polytheism in taking oaths
It is an act of polytheism to swear by others, besides Allah

~. Abdullah bin 'Umar ~ said: "Do not swear by anything
besides Allah, for I have heard the Prophet say: 'He who
swears by anything beside Allah is guilty of an act of
disbelief (or of associating something with Allah). "' 7

It is also an expression of polytheism when one person says
to another: "What Allah wills and what you will." It was
reported that a man said a similar expression to the Prophet
~' and so he ~ told him: "Have you made me a partner of
Allah?" You should say: "What Allah wills, Alone."
Everything in this universe operates according to the Will of
Allah ~ ' even though Allah has said in the Qur' an: ( To
whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight.) 8

There are other expressions of polytheism, such as:
"I rely on Allah and on you."
"I have none but Allah and you."
"This is of the Blessings of Allah and your blessings."
"I have Allah in the heavens and I have you on earth."
"By Allah and the life of so and so ... "
"I swear by Allah and so and so ... "
"I ask Allah and so and so ... "
It is known that all such acts of worship, such as: reliance,
fear, righteousness, repentance, taking oaths, prostration,
bowing, making tasbeeh, making tahleel, praising, and
seeking forgiveness, are the Rights of Allah, Who, Alone,
should be worshipped and sought, for anything, by His
Servants.

A man was brought to the Prophet ~' after he had committed
a sin, and when he stood before the Prophet ~ ' he said: "O
Allah, I repent to you, and not to Muhammad." The Prophet
~ said: "Allah ~ has made the truth known to these
people." 1

Surat at-Takweer, Verse 28.

164

Polytheism in people's will and intentions
This is an example which has no limit, like a sea which has
no shore; and only a few people are safe from it. Whoever
seeks, in his/her action, other than the Face of Allah ~ . and
intends anything else, apart from getting closer to Allah and
asking His Reward, has committed an act of polytheism
towards his Lord, in his/her intention and will.
Sincerity in worship means that a person should make
his/her words, intentions and actions sincerely for Allah ~ It is the pure religion of Ibrahim ~I and the only religion
accepted by Allah ~ from His Servants; for He ~ said:
( Whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never
be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of
the losers.) 2

The reality of polytheism
Now that you know the different types of polytheism, you
should be able to perceive the answer of the previously
mentioned question, and so I say, with success from
Allah ~ :
The reality of polytheism is that of believing that the Creator
could resemble any of His creation, or that His Creation
could resemble the Creator. It is denying God all His Perfect
Attributes, which He ~ has described Himself with, or has
been described with by His Prophet ~ -

2

Surat Al- ' lmran, Verse 85.

165

It is a special characteristic of the Deity that He is Unique, in

terms of possessing the qualities of giving removing away,
of harming and benefiting. Therefore, it is an obligation to
devote one's supplications, fears, wishes and rely on Allah,
Alone; and so whoever tries to convey these aspirations to
one of Allah's Creation, has associated that creation with
Allah, the Creator; the One God, Who Alone disposes of the
affairs of the universe! Among the requirements of the
Testimony of Faith is that no one should bow down or lower
his/her head humbly to anyone, nor supplicate to another
human being, asking him/her to fulfil his/her needs; for only
Allah is capable of fulfilling anyone's needs. Whatever He
wills takes place, and whatever He does not will does not
take place! None can prevent what He has willed to bestow,
and none can bestow what He has willed to prevent!
One the characteristics of the Deity is Absolute Perfection, in
all aspects, and this necessitates the devotion of worship to
Allah, Alone.
People's status, with regards to their Lord, varies according
to their utmost love and submission to Him, and this
conforms to the standards of the fitrah (original pure nature)
which exists in every human being from childbirth.
However, the shayateen (devils) have endeavoured to change
people's nature and corrupt their minds, so Allah~ sent His
Messengers with the Revelation to guide with His Light;
(Allah guides to His Light whom He wills.) 1
Prostration is a special act of worship for Allah ~. Alone, so
whoever prostrates to others beside Him, has resembled Him
1

Surat an-Nur, Verse 35.

to His Creation. The same judgment applies to the devotion
of other actions for other than Allah ~' such as: reliance,
repentance, taking oaths, praising and glorifying, etc.
The Prophet~ said: "Allah~ said: 'Pride is My Cloak and
Greatness is My Robe, and so he who competes with Me in
respect of either of them I shall cast into the Hell-Fire." 2
The Prophet ~ said: "The people with the utmost
punishment on the Day of Resurrection would be the
painters; as it would be said to them: 'Put life into what you
have created (i.e. painted). '"3
The Prophet ~ said: "Allah ~ said: 'Who are most unjust
than those who try to create something like My Creation? I
challenge them to create even the smallest ant or, a grain of
wheat or barley. "'4
The Prophet~ said: "The most awful name in Allah's Sight,
on the Day of Resurrection, would be (that of) a man calling
himself 'Malik Al-Amlak' (the king of kings)." 5

This is the Wrath of Allah ~ upon anyone who tries to bear
any resemblance to Him, in His Names and Attributes.
Allah ~. Alone, is the King of the Kings, the Ruler over all
rulers. He ~' Alone, rules over all of their rulers and judges.

The greatest sin is to have a poor opinion of Allah ~
Whoever has a poor opinion of the Lord has indeed denied
the Lord His Scared Perfection, in His Names and Attributes.
Allah ~ has promised a severe punishment for those who
think evil thoughts about Him, when He ~ said: ( for them

is a disgraceful torment, and the Anger of Allah is upon
them. He has cursed them and prepared Hell for them and worst indeed is that destination) 6 and He ~ said to
those who denied Him any one of His Attributes: (That
thought of yours which you thought about your Lord, has
brought you to destruction, and you have become of
those utterly lost! )7
Allah ~ also said about Ibrahim ~I that he said to his
people: ( When he said to his father and to his people:
"What is that which you worship? Is it a falsehood - gods

other than Allah - that you desire? Then what you think
about the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind,jinn and all that

you have worshipped other gods?

submits to Him in complete humiliation; for Allah ~ . Alone,

deserves All Praise, Glorification and Adoration. It is a great
injustice to devote such rights to other gods, besides Allah
~- He ~ said: (He sets forth for you a parable from
yourselves: Do you have partners among those whom
your right hands possess (i.e. slaves) to share as equals, in
the wealth We have bestowed on you, whom you fear as
you fear each other? Thus we explain the signs in detail
to a people who have sense.)' i.e. if one of you haughtily
rejects allowing his Servant to become an equal partner in all
his property, then why do you appoint My Servant to share
equally that which is My Property; I am the Deity, to Whom
nothing is to be attributed, besides Me, as that does not suit
anyone but Me! Whoever claims so has not estimated Me
with the estimation that is due to Me, and has not duly
glorified Me.
Allah ~ said: ( 0 mankind! A similitude has been coined,
so listen to it carefully: Verily, those on whom you call
besides Allah, cannot create (even) a fly, even if they met
together for the purpose; and if the fly should snatch
away anything from them, they would have no power to
release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and
the sought. They have not estimated Allah by His
Rightful Estimate. Verily, Allah is All-Strong, AllMighty.) 2
Allah ~ also said: ( They did not make a just estimate of
Allah such as is due to Him. On the Day of the
Resurrection, the whole of the earth will be grasped by
His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right

Hand. Glorified and Exalted is He above all that they
associate as partners with Him.) 3
Whatever exists in this Universe is weak before All-Mighty
Allah; therefore, whoever associates anything with Allah has
not estimated Him His Rightful Estimate.
Those who do not estimate Allah by His Rightful Estimate
claim that Allah ~ never sent His Messengers nor revealed
His Book to His Creation; that He ~ simply created them
and ignored them!
Those who do not estimate Allah by His Rightful Estimate
deny Him His Names and Attributes, such as Hearing, Sight,
Will, Choice, His Elevation above His Creation, and His
Speaking to whomsoever He choses among His Creation.
Those who do not estimate Allah by His Rightful Estimate
claim that Allah ~ punishes His Servants for something they
did not do, or have no power or effect over. They claim that
whatever takes place is an act of God, and so a Servant
would be punished for something he/she was forced to do by
his/her Creator!
How could one imagine that the Best of Judges and the Most
Merciful should compel His Servant to do an act, which is
beyond his/her will and determination, and then punish
him/her eternally for it? Allah is Above all their evil claims
and accusations.

3

Surat az-Zumur, Verse 67.

170

Those who do not estimate Allah by His Rightful Estimate
follow the Devil and make him equal to Allah ~' in
observing the qualities of Glory, Obedience, Submission,
Fear and Hope in him (the devil).
Allah ~ said: (Did I not command you, 0 Children of

Adam, that you should not worship Satan? Verily, he is a
plain enemy to you. You should worship Me, Alone; that
is the Straight Path.) 4
The devil also invites the polytheist to worship him, claiming
that he is an angel. Allah ~ said: (The Day when He will

gather them all together, then He will say to the angels:
"Was it you that these people used to worship?" The
angels said: "Glorified are You! You are our Lord
instead of them. Nay, but they used to worship the jinn,
most of them were believers in them.") 1 Similarly, other
polytheists worship the sun, moon and stars, claiming that
they worship the spirits of these planets, which address them,
and fulfil their desires. So as the sun rises, the devil stands
with his horns appearing to be on both sides of the sun, and
when the polytheists prostrate to it, they are in fact
prostrating to the devil, and the same thing happens at
sunset.
Therefore, whoever worships others besides Allah ~ has
indeed worshipped Satan, including those who worship
Prophet 'Isa (Jesus) ~\ and his mother, because it is the
devil who commands them to worship them. Allah ~ said:

( On the Day when He will gather them all together and
4

I

Surat Ya-Sin, Verse 60-61.

say: "0 you assembly of jinn! You gained many followers
among mankind." And their friends among mankind will
say, "Our Lord, we benefited from one another, and now
we have reached the term which You have determined
for us." He will say: "The Fire is your home, you will be
in it timelessly, forever, except as Allah wills. Your Lord
is All-Wise, All-Knowing.") 2
This shows the reason for which polytheism is regarded as
the greatest sin in Allah's Sight; it is unforgivable, unless
one repents, and leads to eternal punishment in the Hell-Fire.

Pride is as great a sin as polytheism
Pride, with its consequences, remains a great sin opposing
the purpose for which Allah ~ created His Creation, just as
the greatest sin, polytheism. Allah ~ created His Creation
and revealed His Book in order that complete obedience be
devoted to Him, Alone. Therefore, He ~ forbade the entry
into Paradise for polytheists and any of those who have the
weight of a mustard seed of pride in their hearts.

A great evil
It is a great evil to give one's opinion regarding the Names,
Attributes and Actions of Allah ~ without having any proper
knowledge about them. To describe Allah ~ with anything
contrary to what He ~ has described Himself, or has been
described with by the Prophet ~ is also a great sin. It is the
most degenerate thing to do to the Attribute of Perfection of

2

Surat Al-An'am, Verse 128.

172

the One Who is the Owner of the Creation and the
Command.

If such an act is issued out of knowledge, then it is an act of
obstinacy, which is even more evil than polytheism in the
Sight of Allah. A polytheist who still acknowledges the
Attributes of the Lord is less evil than the one who denies the
Lord His Attributes of Perfection!
The denial of the Attributes of the Lord IS the ailment
without a cure.
Pharaoh, the leader of such polytheists, rejected the
statement of Musa (Moses) ~I, when he said that his Lord
was above the heavens; so he responded, saying: ( 0

Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways;
the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the God of
Musa. But verily, I think he is a liar.) 3 Shaikh Abu AlHasan Al-Ash'ari used this Verse as argumentative evidence
against all those who deny Allah His Own Attributes.
Deviating innovation is one of the greatest sins; and is more
preferred by Iblis (Satan) than other major sins. One of the
past scholars said: "An innovation is more beloved by Iblis
than an act of disobedience to Allah; because one can repent
from a disobedient act, but can hardly do so from an
innovation."
lblis said: "I have exhausted the Children of Adam with sins,
and they have exhausted me by seeking forgiveness from
Allah and testifying that there is no god worthy of worship
3

Surat Ghafir, Verses 36-37.

173

but Allah, Alone. On seeing this, I established among them
sects (and heretic tendencies); so they commit sins and do
not repent from them, because they think that they are
acquiring good by their deeds!"
A sinner harms only himself; whereas an innovator harms
himself as well as upon other people. The fitnah (test, trial,
tribulation) of an innovator affects the basis of religion;
whereas the fitnah of a sinner is in having to cope his own
desires.
An innovator drives people away from the Right Path,
whereas a sinner does not do so.
An innovator denies people the right way to the Hereafter,
whilst a sinner is slowed down because of his sins.

Tyranny and Oppression
Tyranny and oppression are among the greatest sins because
they oppose justice, upon which the heavens and the earth
were established. Allah ~ sent His Messengers and Books
in order that people might establish justice among
themselves.
The act of killing unlawfully, without any right, is a great
sin. Islam cites many examples of such evil acts, like the
killing of one's child for fear that the child might share one's
provision (i.e. food, drink, and money); the killing of one's
parents who were the cause of one's existence; the killing of
one's kin.

174

The grade of such an evil act differs according to the nature
of the act itself; therefore, the person who will receive the
utmost punishment on the Day of Resurrection is the one
who killed a prophet, followed by the one who killed an
Imam, or a scholar who commanded justice among people
and invited them to the Path of Allah ~Allah ~ has set the punishment for the intentional killing of
a believer as dwelling eternally in the Hell-Fire, with the
Curse and Anger of the Lord.

The evil consequences of killing
Allah ~ said: ( Because of that, We ordained for the
Children of Israel that if anyone killed a person, not in

retaliation for murder or for spreading mischief in the
land, it would be as if he had killed the whole of
mankind; and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he
had saved the life of the whole of mankind) 1
This has caused some confusion among many people.
It is known that the sin of the one who killed a hundred
persons is greater in the Sight of Allah than the sin of the one
who killed only one person. Some people believe that the
resemblance in the sin suggests the resemblance of the
punishment; but resembling one thing with another thing
does not suggest taking it with all its regulations. Allah ~
has said: (The Day they see it, it will be as if they had not

tarried in the world except an afternoon or a morning) 2
I

2

Surat Al-Ma'idah, Verse 32.
Surat an-Nazi'at, Verse 46.

175

and ( On the Day when they will see that (torment) with
which they are promised as if they had not stayed more
than as hour in a single day) 3. This does not necessarily
mean that they stayed in this world only for that period of
time. The Prophet ~ said: "If someone performs the 'Jsha
Salat in congregation, it is as if he had stood in prayer for
half a night, and if someone performs the Fajr Salat in
congregation, it is as if he had stood in prayer for a whole
night" 1• He ~ also said: "He who observed the fast of
Ramadan and then followed it with six (fasts) of Shawwal, it
would be as if he fasted perpetually."2 And he ~ also said:
"If anyone recites surat: ( Say: He is Allah, the One) , it is
as if he had recited one third of the Qur'an." 3
However, it is known that the reward for the doer of such
acts - as mentioned in the above Hadiths - does not reach
the reward of the one resembled. If they are considered equal
in reward, then the person who performs 'Isha and Fajr in
congregation and stands performing the night prayer in
between them would just be tiring himself all night, with no
extra reward due.

If it is said: "Then where is the resemblance between the one
who kills one person and the one who kills a hundred
persons"?
The resemblance is in many aspects:
First, Both of them are disobedient to Allah ~ and His
Messenger ~' and are to receive Allah ' s Punishment, and
both of them have earned Allah's Anger and Curse, and
dwelling eternally in the Hell-Fire. The difference between
them is in their punishment in their lowest levels of Hell.
Second, they both equally deserve being killed.
Third, they are both equally guilty in their willingness to kill
unlawfully. Whoever kills a person without any right, simply
for causing mischief in the land, can kill anyone just to take
their property; therefore he is an enemy to humanity!
Fourth, Allah ~ has made the believers, in their mercy and
sympathy towards one another, as one body; so when a killer
hurts one part of that body, all the other parts of that body
are also hurt. So when someone hurts a believer, it is as if he
has hurt all the believers.
The Prophet ~ said: "No human being is killed unjustly, but
a part of the responsibility for that crime is laid up on the
first son of Adam (Qabil) who invented the tradition of
killing (murdering) on the earth."4 Although, this promise of

177

punishment never came to apply to the first fornicator, the
first thief, or the first drunkard.
The first polytheist would be rather more deserving of that
punishment than the first killer, because he/she would have
been the first to set the example of polytheism. It is for this
reason that the Prophet ~ saw 'Umar bin Luhay Al-Khuza'i
receiving the greatest punishment in the Hell-Fire, because
he was the first who changed the Religion of Ibrahim ~,; as
Allah ~ said: (and do not be the first to disbelieve
therein) 5 i.e. that people take you as an example - after you
- and so their sins of disbelief would rest upon you. The
same judgment is for the one who sets a bad practice which
people followed.

Abu Hurayrah 4, reported that the Prophet ;i said: "Abusing

The evil consequences of fornication
Fornication is a great evil which can destroy society. It is
contrary to the benefit of the global values of preserving
lineage, protecting chastity and the sanctity of individuals. It
spreads animosity and enmity among people, as committing
adultery affects other people's wives, mothers, sisters and
daughters. It causes destruction to human society, and
therefore comes after the evil of killing in terms of the grade
of its evil.
Imam Ahmad said: "I don't know a greater evil after killing
(an innocent person) than adultery. Allah ~ affirmed its
unlawfulness, saying: ( Those who do not invoke any other

god along with Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has
forbidden, except for just cause, nor commit illegal
sexual intercourse - and whoever does this shall receive
the punishment. The torment will be doubled to him on
the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in
disgrace, except those repent) 7 So Allah ~ has compared
adultery with polytheism and killing people (without a just
cause), and made the recompense for such evil act an eternal
abode and double punishment in Hell, if the person does not
give up such behaviour with sincere repentance, having good
faith and performing good deeds . Allah ~ has said: (Do not

come near adultery, verily it is a great sin and an evil
way.) 8 This great sin is abhorred by common sense, and
even many animals repel it, as it was reported in Sahib AlBukhari, on the authority of Amru bin Maymun Al-Awdy
who said: "During the pre-Islamic period of ignorance I saw
a she-monkey surrounded by a number of monkeys. They
7

8

Surat Al-Furqan, Verses 68-70.
Surat Al-Jsra', verse 32.

180

were all stoning it to death along with the monkey who had
committed unauthorised sexual intercourse."
Allah ~ states that among the ways for a person to succeed
in the Hereafter is to preserve his/her chastity: ( Successful
indeed are the believers, those who offer their Salat with
all solemnity and full submissiveness, and those who turn
away from falsehood, and those who pay Zakat, and those
who guard their chastity, except from their wives or the
slaves which their right hands possess - for then, they are
free from blame; but whoever seeks beyond that, then
those are the transgressors) 1
As Allah ~ said, Man was created very impatient; he is
irritable when evil affects him, and when good affects him,
he is niggardly, except those whom Allah ~ has singled out,
again, in the following Verse: ( those who guard their
chastity (i.e. private parts from illegal sexual acts), except
from their wives or (the women slaves) whom their right
hands possess - for then they are not blameworthy. But
whosoever seeks beyond that, then it is those who are
trespassers.)2
Four ways through which sins may invade a person
Since the starting point for the evil of adultery is the vision,
Allah ~ has commanded Muslims to lower their gaze;
because evil starts with a glance, followed by a feeling of
passion, then moving closer, and finally in committing the
sinful act.
I

Surat AI-Mu'minun, Verses 1-7.
Surat AI-Ma ' arij, Verses 29-31.

(1) Looking at the unlawful is the main way to generate
passion, and so whoever abstains from it, has indeed
preserved his/her chastity. The Prophet~ said: "Do not take
a second look, because while you are not to blame for the
first, you have no right for the second." 3
The Prophet :I; also said: "A look is one of the poisonous
arrows of Iblis (Satan), so whoever lowers his eyes from
looking at a woman's beauty, Allah would produce for him
an act of worship whose sweetness he would experience."4
The Prophet ~ also said: "Beware! Avoid sitting on the
roads." They (the people) said: "O Messenger of Allah! We
can't help sitting (on the roads) as these are our places where
we chat." The Prophet ~ replied: "If you have to sit, then
pay the road its right." They asked: "What is the right of the
road, 0 Messenger of Allah?" He ~ answered: "Lowering
your gaze, refraining from harming others, returning a
greeting, and enjoining what is good, and forbidding what is
evil. " 5
Staring lies behind some of the main calamities which afflict
mankind. Indeed, looking produces desire; desire produces
thoughts; thoughts produce passion; passion produces will
power which turns into strong determination, and ends up as
an action, as long as there is no impediment. In this context,

it was said: "Patience in lowering one's gaze is easier (to
deal with) than the patience with the pain of the aftermath of
that gaze."
(2) Desires and inclinations are the starting point of good
and evil, and it is from them that will and determination are
generated. Therefore, whoever controls his/her desires has
indeed controlled him/herself; and whoever surrenders to
his/her own desires, would be overwhelmed by them, but
whoever thinks little of his/her inclinations, they would
guide him to his/herself-destruction.
Desires keep on
approaching the heart until they become wishes, as Allah ~
has said: ( .. .like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one
thinks it to be water until he comes up to it, he finds it to
be nothing; but he finds Allah with him, Who will pay
him his due. Allah is Swift in taking account) 1
The most despised people, in terms of their determination,
are those who tum facts into false wishes, and observe these
in their mean lives.
These false wishes are damaging to man, as they generate a
sense of lassitude and apathy, and produce a feeling of
negligence, remorse and regret.
When the wisher misses the interaction of the truth within
his/her body, he/she depicts its picture in his/her heart, and
so he/she becomes contented with illusionary images
portrayed by his/her own thoughts, which never brings
him/her any real satisfaction in life. His/her example is like
that of a person who is both hungry and thirsty, picturing
I

Surat an-Nur, Verse 39.

183

images of food and drink in his/her mind, without having
any food or drink to ease his/her hunger and thirst.
Accepting such a state of mind shows a low degree of the
self esteem and is also a disgrace; because the dignity and
purity of the self lies in rejecting any unreal desire or
fantasy.
Man's desires may be divided into four categories:
Desires with which man attains worldly benefits, desires
with which he drives away his worldly problems, desires
with which he attains benefit in the Hereafter, and desires
with which he drives away any harm in the Hereafter.
A reasonable person would not hesitate to prefer desires
which would gain him/her the benefits in the Hereafter, by
seeking the Pleasure of his/her Lord.
Such desires and thoughts are defined according to their
priorities:
First, reflecting on the Revelation and understanding its
meaning. Allah ~ did not send it down just to recite it.
Rather, its recitation is just a means to enable a person to
ponder on its context. One past scholar said: "The Qur'an
was revealed to be implemented on; so turn its recitation into
practice!"
Second, reflecting on Allah's Signs and using them as
evidence to confirm Allah's Names, Attributes, Wisdom,
Benevolence and Generosity, as Allah ~ has urged His
Servants to reflect on His Signs and understand them.

184

Third, thinking of Allah's Beneficence, Forgiveness, Mercy,
Patience, and bestowing His Blessings upon His Servants.
These three types of reflection extract from the heart: the
knowledge, love, and fear of Allah, which may be firmly
established by the remembrance of Allah ~Fourth, thinking of the defects of the self and of one's
actions. This thought has a great beneficial effect, as it
breaks the self which commands evil, allowing one's heart to
live in a serene world.
Fifth, thinking of the duty of time and its function, and
directing all worries around it, to avoid wasting any fraction
of it. In fact, all benefits are generated from time, and any
wasted time remains irreplaceable.
A scholar Shafi'i said: "I have accompanied Sufi people and
I have not benefited from them, except for two expressions:
first, from their saying: "Time is a sword; if you do not cut
it, it will cut you." Second, "If you do not occupy yourself
with the truth, it will occupy you with falsehood. "
A person's time is indeed his/her lifetime; it is a way leading
to his/her eternal blessed life (in Paradise), or the way to
his/her eternal tormented life (in the Hell-Fire). It passes by
faster than the clouds move. Whatever time a person spends
in obedience to Allah is indeed his/her true life, but whatever
else cannot regarded as his/her life; even if he/she has
already lived it, his/her life could be compared to that of
animals. Even a person performing Sa/at does not gain from
his/her Sa/at except that which he/she remembers of it;
therefore man's life is only that spent in obedience to Allah

185

~ . and everything else is but the devil's whisperings and
false wishes.
You should know that a desire in itself does not harm
anyone; what is harmful is interacting or reacting to it. A
desire is like a passer-by; if you ignore it, it will go away;
but if you invite it in, it would bewitch you with its deceptive
speech.
Allah ~ has placed two kinds of selves in man: a self that is
commanding and a self that is peaceful, and they oppose
eachother; whatever is light for one is heavy for the other,
and whatever satisfies one torments the other. An Angel is
on the right side of the heart, while a devil is on the left side
of it. There is an on-going battle, until the self completes its
life in this world. All falsehood is on the side of the devil
and the self commanding evil; while all the truth stays on the
side of the Angel and the peaceful mind. The on-going
battle is recorded, and victory is gained by one ' s patience.
Whoever endures, shows patience and fears Allah would
have a good ending in this world and the Hereafter. Allah ~
has decreed that there will be a blessed end is for the pious.
(3) Speech should be preserved and used only for what is
beneficial. One should say only that which is beneficial to
one's Deen (religion). One should think twice before
uttering a word, and whether it is useful for one's religion or
not; if there is no gain in saying it, one should abstain from
uttering it; but if there is any benefit in it, one should not
waste the opportunity of saying it. If one wants to give
evidence about what is inside the hearts (of others), one
should consider their expressions. In fact, the tongue reveals
the condition of the heart, whether its owner likes it or not!

186

Yahya bin Mu'adh said: "Hearts are like cooking pots with
their boiling contents, and tongues are their ladles. When a
man speaks, his tongue scoops up what is inside his heart;
sweet or sour."
Anas bin Malik ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said: "A
man's Iman (faith) is not straight until his heart is straight;
and his heart is not straight until his tongue is straight." 1
Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said:
"By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, a man is not a Muslim
till his heart and tongue are submissive."2
The Prophet ~ was asked about the most common things
which bring people into Hell, to which he ~ replied: "The
mouth and the private parts." 3
Mu'adh asked the Prophet~ about a deed which could cause
him to be admitted into Paradise and would keep him away
from the Fire. So the Prophet ~ informed him that the root
of a matter is Islam, its contours Sa/at (Prayers) and its peak
is striving in the Cause of Allah (Jihad). Then he ~ asked:
"Shall I tell you of that which is at the bottom of all this?"
Mu'adh replied: "Certainly, Messenger of Allah." The
Prophet~ took hold of his tongue and said: "Keep this under
control." Mu'adh said: "Shall we be called to account in
respect of that which we say?" He ~ answered: "May your

Hell only on account of the harvest of their tongue?"
What is amazing is the fact that there are cases where a
person may find it easy to abstain from consuming Haram
such as: transgressing, fornicating, stealing, drinking wine or
looking at the unlawful, yet finds it hard to control the
movements of his/her tongue, and you see him uttering
words that invite the Curse of Allah ~ upon him/her!
Such case is mentioned in the Hadith of Jundub bin Abdullah
~ who said: "The Prophet ~ stated that a person said: "Allah
would not forgive such and such person." Whereupon Allah
~ said: "Who is he who adjures about Me that I would not
grant pardon to so and so; I have granted pardon to so and so
and blotted out your deeds (the deeds of the one who took an
2
oath that Allah would not grant pardon to that person)." So
that devout man who had worshipped Allah ~ all his life had
his deeds blotted out for a single phrase that he had uttered!
Reporting the same Hadith, Abu Hurayrah ~ said: "The man
uttered a single word which destroyed his life in this world
and the Hereafter!"
Abu Hurayrah ~ said: "The Prophet ~ said: "A Servant (of
Allah) may utter a word which pleases Allah, without giving
it much importance; and because of that Allah ~ will raise

Bilal bin Al-Harith ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said: "A
man speaks a good word, not realising its worth; for which
Allah records for him with His Good Pleasure till the day he
meets Him. A man also speaks an evil word, not realising its
importance, for which Allah records for him His Displeasure
till the day he meets Him. " 4 'Alqamah used to say: "The
Hadith of Bilal bin AI-Harith prevented me from saying
many words!"
Anas bin Malik ~ said: "When one of the companions died a
man said: 'Rejoice over his Paradise.' But the Prophet ~
said: 'Do you say this when you do not know whether he
perhaps spoke about that which did not concern him, or was
niggardly about something which would have caused him no
loss?"' 5

of Allah, tell me something about Islam of which I would not
be able to ask anyone other than you'. He :i said: "Say: 'I

hold of his own tongue and said: "This!"2
Umm Habibah ,$,, the wife of the Prophet :I, reported that
the Prophet :I said: "Everything a son of Adam says counts
against him and not in his favour, except: recommending
what ever is good, prohibiting what ever is objectionable, or
making mention of Allah."3 In another Hadith, the Prophet :j
said that when a man gets up in the morning, all the limbs
humble themselves before the tongue and say: "Fear Allah
for our sake, for we are dependent on you; if you are straight
we are straight, but if you are crooked we are crooked. "4

person utters is recorded or simply that regarding good and
evil, with the first opinion being mostly considered, because

Allah ~ said: (Not a word does he (or she) utter but there
is a watcher by him ready to record it.) 5
There are two great ailments related to the tongue; if a man
is safe from one, he is not safe from the other; they are the
ailments of "speech" and "silence". One can be a greater sin
than the other; for a man who keeps silent about the truth is a
"dumb devil", disobedient to Allah ~; while the man who
speaks falsehood is a "speaking devil", disobedient to
Allah ~Righteous people are those who restrain their tongues from
uttering falsehood, but loosen them to speak about whatever
is beneficial for them in their Hereafter.
A person could come on the Day of Resurrection with good
deeds, the size of mountains, yet they were ruined by his/her
tongue; or a person could come with bad deeds, the size of
mountains, but he/she would find that his/her tongue
destroyed them with constant remembrance of Allah!

(4) Footsteps should be preserved in the sense that one has
to use his feet to take one to where one should gain the
Reward of Allah, not His Curse.
Since a slip is related to the foot as well as to the tongue,
they were both mentioned in the Verse, as Allah ~ said:
( The Faithful Servants of the Most Gracious (Allah) are
those who walk on the earth with humility and

words) they reply back with mild words of gentleness.) 6
Allah ~ described His Faithful Servants with straightness in
their words and footsteps.

The unlawfulness of illegal sexual acts
The Prophet ~ said: "The most common things which bring
people into Hell are: the mouth and the private parts." 7
He ~ also said: "The blood of a Muslim man is not permitted
(to be shed) except for of three: a mature adulterous person
(who is or has been married), a person to be killed (in
retaliation) for the killing of another person, and one who
abandons his religion, separating himself from the
community." 1 This Hadith which relates adultery to
polytheism and killing is similar in context to Verse 68 of
Surat Al-Furqan and the Hadith oflbn Mas'ud ~ .
In the above Hadith, the Prophet ~ mentioned that which is
happening in order of frequently, as adultery occurs more
often than killing people, and killing people occurs more
than apostasy. The Prophet ~ also moved from a great sin to
the greatest; the consequences of adultery are evil, with
regards to the well-being of humanity. When a woman

commits adultery, she disgraces her husband, family and
relatives, before people. If she should become pregnant and
kill her child, she would have combined adultery with
killing; but if she tried to relate the child of adultery to her
husband, he or she would enter into her family as a stranger,
and would inherit from them while being not one of them,
and would stay alone with women/men in the family while
he/she is unrelated to them. As for the adultery of a man, it
also causes the mixing of kinship, and the violation of the
sanctity of the woman, who would be liable to all sorts of
evil consequences.
Some of the characteristics of adultery are that it enjoins
poverty, shortens (true) life, darkens the face of the
fornicator, and makes him become despised among people.
Adultery corrupts the heart with worry, anxiety and fear. It
takes the adulterer away from the angels, bringing him closer
to the devil. There is no evil consequence greater than
killing (an innocent person) than that of adultery. It is for
this reason that Islam commands capital punishment for a
mature fornicator, in a gruesome way. If any man was
informed that his wife had committed a murder, he would
find it easier to accept than if he was informed that she had
committed adultery.
Sa'd bin 'Ubada ~ said: "If I saw a man with my wife, I
would strike him (behead him) with the blade of my sword."
This news reached the Messenger of Allah ~ who then said:
"You people are astonished at Sa'd's ghaira. By Allah, I
have more ghaira than he, and Allah has more ghaira than I,
and because of Allah's Ghaira, He has made shameful deeds

193

and sins (such as illegal sexual intercourse etc.), done openly
or secretly, unlawful." 2
The Prophet ~ said: "Allah has a sense of Ghaira, and
Allah's Sense of Ghaira is provoked whenever a believer
does something which Allah has prohibited."3
The Prophet ~ also said: ""None has more sense of ghaira
(self-respect) than Allah, therefore He has prohibited
shameful sins (such as illegal sexual intercourse, etc.),
whether they are committed openly or secretly; and there is
none who likes people to repent to Him and beg His Pardon
than Allah, and it is for this reason He ~ sent wamers and
bearers of good news; And there is none who likes to be
praised more than Allah does, and for this reason, He ~
praises Himself."
The Prophet ~ said, when g1vmg a sermon for Sa/at AlKusuf (the Eclipse Prayer): "O followers of Muhammad!
There is none, who has a greater sense of Ghira (selfrespect) than Allah, so He has forbidden that His Male
Servant should commit illegal sexual intercourse or that His
Female Servant should commit illegal sexual intercourse. 0

followers of Muhammad! If you but knew what I know, you
would laugh less and weep more!" 1
The reference of this major sin in the sermon of Salat AlKusuf makes so much sense to whoever ponders well over it.
Indeed, the spread of adultery is one of the signs of the
destruction of this world, and is also one of the Signs of the
Hour, as mentioned in the two Sahih books (of Al-Bukhari
and Muslim): On the authority of Anas bin Malik ~ ' who
said: "I will narrate to you a Hadith that none will relate to
you after me, which I heard from the Prophet :!. For I heard
the Messenger of Allah ~ say: 'Among the portents of the
Hour are (the following): a decrease of Islamic Knowledge,
widespread ignorance (about Islam), a common drinking of
wine, widespread adultery, and a shortage of men and
increase (in number) of women so much so that fifty women
would be looked after by one man. " 2

It is part of the Pattern set by Allah ~ for His Creation that
the prevalence of adultery invites His Anger which
inevitably leads to the occurrence of His Punishment on
earth. Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~ said: "Whenever usury and
adultery prevail in a community, Allah ~ orders its
destruction."

of adultery:
First, killing in the most horrible manner (for married
adulterers), and the flogging (eighty lashes) as a corporal
punishment, and exile for a year as a mental punishment.
Second, Allah ~ has forbidden His Servants to feel pity for
the adulterers, a fact which would prevent them from
afflicting the prescribed punishment for them. Allah ~ is
more Merciful than His Servants, and His Mercy did not
prevent Him from prescribing such a punishment for
adulterers. Therefore, His Servants should not yield to the
mercy within their hearts and abolish this punishment.
Third, Allah ~ has ordered that the execution of the
punishment be done in public, in the presence of the faithful.
This is for the benefit of teaching others a lesson, so that
they would think twice before committing such an evil
illegal act.
The punishment of the married adulterer is derived from the
punishment set by Allah ~ for the people of Lut (Lot) (i.e.
stoning to death), because adultery and homosexuality are
both illegal sexual acts. They both have evil consequences
which oppose the Wisdom of Allah ~ in His Creation and
His Command.
There are so many evil consequences of homosexuality that
they cannot be counted. It is better for a sodomiser to be
killed than to go no to commit an other homosexual act,
because it is such an evil act that it corrupts him in a manner

196

that no good could ever be hoped for from him; he loses all
sense of modesty and his soul becomes poisoned with evil.
People have differed as to whether or not such person would
enter Paradise.
Those who say that he would never enter Paradise argue
their claim with the following different opinions:
That the Prophet ~ said: "A child of adultery does not enter
Paradise." 3 They say that this is the case of a child of
adultery; he/she is a source of evil because he/she is created
from an illegal sperm, even if he/she is innocent of that act.
Therefore, the sodomised (or sodomiser) is even more evil
than the child born of adultery; he is more likely to attract
nothing but wickedness, because he took part in an evil
illegal act; besides that, he would never be supported by
Allah ~ to fulfil any good deed, nor acquire any beneficial
knowledge, nor achieve pure repentance.
However, after carefully studying this matter, we could say:
"If a person who is afflicted with this evil ailment gives it up
and seeks pure repentance, and changes his bad deeds for
good deeds, and washes his disgrace away with all kinds of
obedient acts to Allah ~. with sincerity and good faith, then
such a person would be forgiven by Allah ~, and would
become one of the people of Paradise, because Allah ~
forgives all sins."
If repentance wipes away every sin, even polytheism, killing
of Prophets, sorcery, etc, then it would not be short of wiping
3

Recorded by Ahmad in his Musnad (2/ 203), Darami in the book, "AlAshribah", chapter 5.

197

away this sin (homosexuality). Indeed, the wisdom of Allah
has been established with justice, as it states that: "A person
who repents from a sin is like one who has no sin." 1 Allah ~
has guaranteed to those who repent from polytheism, killing
(a person), or adultery, that He ~ would change their bad
deeds for good deeds; as He ~ has said: ( 0 My Servants
who have transgressed against themselves (by
committing evil deeds and sins)! Do not despair of the
Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He
is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.) 2 Therefore, no sin is
singled out from this generality; yet this only applies to the
repentant.
A homosexual who carries on into his older life to be more
evil than when he was younger, would never be successful
and thus achieve pure repentance, regaining whatever good
had passed him in his life. Allah would not change his bad
deeds into good ones, because he would not be supported so
as to savour a good ending, by being allowed entry into
Paradise. But rather all this is a punishment for him by
Allah ~' as all his evil deeds would be added together to
increase his punishment.
When you look at the case of many dying people (people in
the throes of death), you may see that they are prevented
from achieving a good ending, (i.e. they fail to utter the
testimony of faith - la ilaha ilia Allah, Muhammad rasul
Allah), as a punishment for their constant evil deeds!

Once, Sufyan Ath-Thawri wept all night, and in the morning,
it was said to him: "Is all this because you are worried about
sins?" Then he took a handful of dust and said: "Sins are of
less value than this. But rather, I weep for fear of a bad
ending! "
This is the greatest example of good understanding in Islam;
that a man fears that his sins may betray him in his dying
moments, standing between him and a good ending!
Imam Ahmad reported that when Abu Darda' ~ was dying,
he used to go unconscious and when he came around, he
would recite: ( We shall turn their hearts and eyes away

from guidance as they refused to believe therein for the
first time, and We shall leave them in their trespass to
wander blindly .) 3
Imam Ahmad said: "One should know that the bad ending we seek refuge in Allah ~ from it - does not occur to those
whose life was righteous. Rather, it happens to those who
insist on disobeying Allah ~ and do not hesitate to commit
all kinds of evil deeds. Such people are overwhelmed by
their own wickedness, until they are over taken by death,
before having had any chance to repent.

The punishment for homosexuality
Since homosexuality is one of the most evil deeds, its
prescribed punishment is one of the greatest punishments,
both in this world and the Hereafter.

3

Surat AI-An 'am , Verse 110.

199

The scholars have differed as to whether its punishment is
greater and more severe than that of adultery, or that they are
similar.
Abu Bakr As-Siddiq, Ali bin Abi Talib, Khalid bin AIWaleed, Abdullah bin Az-Zubayr, Abdullah bin Abbas, Jabir
bin Zayd, Abdullah bin 'Umar, Az-Zuhari, Rabee'ah bin Abi
Abdir-Rahman, Malik, Ishaq bin Rahawayh, Imam Ahmad
and Shafii all stated that the punishment for homosexuality
should be harsher than that of adultery, that is killing, in any
case.
'Ata' bin Abi Rabah, Al-Hasan Al-Basri, Sa' id bin AlMusayyib, Ibrahim An-Nakha'i, Qatadah, AL-Awza' i, Shafii
(his second opinion), Imam Ahmad (his second opinion),
Abu Yusuf and Muhammad all stated that the punishment
for homosexuality should be similar to that of adultery.
Al-Hakim and Abu Haneefah have stated that the
punishment for homosexuality should not go beyond
censuring and chastisement, and have argued their opinion
on the fact that Allah ~ or His Prophet ~ did not set a
prescribed punishment for such evil act, and that it is an act
which is neither favoured nor desired by human nature.
They have claimed that it is for this reason that Allah ~
prescribed a punishment for adultery, theft, drinking wine,
yet never prescribed a punishment for such abnormal acts as
eating the dead, drinking blood, or eating pork.
However, those who hold the first opinion - which is the
opinion of the majority of the scholars and represents the
overall opinion of the Companions - have said: "There is no
greater evil deed than that of homosexuality; it comes after

200

polytheism and also, perhaps, that of killing," as we shall
clarify, inshallah.
They said: "Allah ~ never tested any nation in the world,
before the nation of Lot, with this great sin, then punished
them in a manner not witnessed by any other nation before.
Allah ~ combined several calamities in their destruction: He
~ over turned their village and rained down stones upon
them, in a well ordered way, each one being destined for
each and every individual among them. This was the severe
punishment for the people in the towns of Sodom and
Gomorah for their evil crime; for angels even flee to remote
areas of this universe for fear that the punishment, set for
those evil people, might touch them. The earth moans and
complains to its Lord, and the mountains nearly move away
from their set positions, when a homosexual act is
committed.
The authentic Sunnah of the Prophet ~' which the
Companions~ put into practice, stated that a homosexual's
punishment is death. It is confirmed that Khalid bin AlWaleed ~ found a homosexual man in the countryside (the
narration says: 'a man on whom a sexual act is practised in
the manner (normally) practised on women'), and wrote to
Abu Bakr ~ . The latter sought the opinions of the other
Companions ~. of whom Ali bin Abi Talib ~ had the
harshest opinion, saying: "No nation has done such an act
except one, and you know what Allah ~ had done to them. I
think he should be thrown into a fire." So Abu Bakr ~
wrote to Khalid (explaining this) and he had him burnt."
Abdullah bin Abbas ~ said: "One should look for the
highest building in the village and throw the homosexual

201

from its summit, face down, followed by stones." Abdullah
bin Abbas ~ derived this punishment from that which Allah
~ had given to the people of Lot. It was also Abdullah bin
Abbas who reported the Hadith in which the Prophet ~ said:
"If you find anyone doing as Lot' s people did, kill the one
who performs it as well as the one to whom it is done." 1
The Prophet ~ said: "Allah has cursed the one who does the
act of Lot's people. Allah has cursed the one who does the
act of Lot's people. Allah has cursed the one who does the
act of Lot's people."2
The Prophet ~ never cursed the adulterer three times, and
never cursed those who do other great sins three times, in
one Hadith. However, he ~ uttered the curse on the
homosexuals three times to put an emphasis on the greatness
of their sin!
Allah ~ said about adultery: ( Do not come near adultery;
it is a great sin and an evil way) 3 and about homosexuality,
in the words of Lut ~\ ( Do you commit the worst sin that
none preceding you has committed in the 'Alamin (the
world of mankind and jinn)? ) 4 We notice that Allah ~
used an indefinite noun to refer to adultery, as a sin among
others, yet He ~ used the definite article to refer to
homosexuality to show the full meaning of this sin.

Allah ~ confirmed the evil of such an act in the fact that no
other nation had done it before Lot's people, saying: ( none
preceding you has committed in the 'Alamin ) and
described it in a manner which is revolts and disgusts the
hearts and human nature, saying: ( Verily, you practice
your lust on men (instead of women)) 5 . Thus, this reveals
the nature of their need for pure satisfaction of their lust,
which is opposed to the reason for which men incline
towards women - i.e. sexual satisfaction, the attainment of
love and mercy among married couples, procreation which
preserves the most dignified of all creations (mankind),
safeguarding women, etc ...
Homosexuals have changed the natural way in which Allah
created men - i.e. to have passion for women and not
men. They go against this nature and prefer to satisfy
themselves with men, and so Allah ~ turned their dwellings
and their hearts up on them; turning their town upside down,
and sending them to an ever lasting punishment.

Allah ~ impeached them with transgression: ( But you are a
people transgressing beyond bounds) 6 , and described
them, in another Verse 7, as a people given to evil.
When those homosexuals came running to Lot ~I, asking
him to provide access to his (two) good looking guests, he
told them: ( 0 my people! Here are my daughters; they
are purer for you (if you marry them lawfully)) 8 . He ~ '
offered to marry them to his daughters for fear of the

disgrace that would have been brought upon him and his
guests: (So fear Allah and do not disgrace me with regard
to my guests! Is there not among you a single rightminded man?) They replied, stubbornly: (Surely, you
know that we have neither any desire nor need of your
daughters, and indeed you know well what we want!)9 .
So he &i.§1 said, in a very distressful manner: ("Would that I
had the strength to overpower you, or that I could betake
myself to some powerful support") 10 • In that distressful
moment, the Messengers of Allah (the two angels who were
sent as guests by Allah) revealed to him their true nature and
the reason for their visit. They informed him that his evil
people would neither be able to reach them nor him, saying
("O Lot! Verily, we are the messengers from your Lord!
They shall not reach you!") 1• They gave him the glad
tiding of the punishment set for his evil people, telling him:
("So travel with your family in a part of the night, and let
not any of you look back; but your wife (will remain
behind), verily, the punishment which will afflict them,
will afflict her. Indeed, morning is their appointed time.
Is not the morning near?") 1
When their appointed time came, all their dwellings were
uprooted and raised up into the sky, until the angels heard
the barking of their dogs and the braying of their donkeys,
and the Command of Allah im went to His Messenger and
Angel, Gabriel &i.§1, who turned them upside down and then
rained down upon them stones of baked clay.

This punishment was made as a sign for mankind, a lesson
for those mindful of Allah ~' and an exemplary punishment
for those who share their transgression.
Therefore, all the passions and satisfactions have gone,
leaving just sorrow and torment. Their lustful satisfaction
was short-lived but their punishment eternal.
They were addicted to their lust, but when they came around,
they found themselves in the land of punishment, in the
place where regret was of no benefit to them. While they are
being tortured in the Hell-Fire, it is said to them: ("You
taste therein its heat and whether you are patient of it or
impatient of it, it is all the same... you are only being
requited for what you used to do.") 2
The punishment for performing a sexual act on animals
The scholars have three opinions regarding this matter:
First, the doer of such act should be disciplined, without
receiving any corporal punishment, which is the opinion of
Malik, Abu Haneefah, and Shafii in one of his two opinions.
Second, its ruling is that of the adulterer; to be flogged if he
is unmarried, and stoned to death if he is married; which was
the opinion of Al-Hasan.
Third, its ruling is that of the homosexual, which was the
opinion of Imam Ahmad. So the punishment is either
irrevocable killing or the set punishment as given to an
adulterer.
2

Surat At-Tur, Verse 16.

205

Those who have said that his punishment should be capital
punishment have argued their case with the Hadith reported
by Abu Dawud, on the authority of lbn 'Abbas ~ that the
Prophet ~ said: "Kill whoever has sexual intercourse with an
animal, and kill the animal with him."3
They said that since it is an illegal sexual act, its punishment
should be like that of a homosexual. Those who did not
consider any prescribed punishment for it have stated that
the above Hadith is weak, and that if it were authentic, they
would have explained this differently.
Isma'il bin Sa'id Al-Shalanji said: "I asked Ahmad about the
one who had sexual intercourse with an animal, but he did
not have any opinion. He could not confirm the Hadith of
'Amru bin Abi 'Amru (who reported from Ibn 'Abbas)."
Tahawi has stated: "This Hadith is weak, and Ibn 'Abbas had
already given his opinion that there is no prescribed
punishment for the one who had sexual intercourse with an
animal." Abu Dawud said that lbn 'Abbas's opinion
weakens this Hadith.
There is no doubt that the natural reprimand of having sexual
intercourse with an animal is stronger than that of
homosexuality, yet it does not mean that both acts are
considered the same, regarding people's nature; in fact,
relating one to the other is a wrong way to conduct
comparative evaluation.
3

Recorded by At-Tinnidhi in the "Book of Hudud", chapter 23-24, Abu
Dawud in the "Book of Hudud' , chapter 108, Ibn Maajah in the "Book of
Hudud', chapter 13, Ahmad in his Musnad(l l 217 269).

206

Comparing homosexuality to lesbianism
It is wrong to compare a lesbian act to a homosexual one,
because there is no definite sexual intercourse in a lesbian
act (no insertion of an organ in the private part). It was
reported in a Hadith that " if a woman has a sexual act with
another woman, they are both adulterers." However, there is
no prescribed punishment for such an act, because there is no
"insertion", while the act is referred to as an act of
fornication in its broadest sense, such as: the fornication of
the eyes, hands, feet or mouth.
If it is confirmed, then the Muslim scholars are in agreement
that the judgment regarding homosexuality with a slave is
the same as the judgment regarding any other person, and so
whoever thinks it is lawful to perform a homosexual act with
one's slave, using, as an argument, Allah's Saying: ( Except

from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands
possess - for then, they are free from blame) 1 has simply
compared his evil act with his right to have sexual
intercourse with his slave-girl.
Thus he is indeed a
disbeliever, who should be given the right to repent, just like
that of the apostate, but if he does not repent, he should be
executed.
Therefore, the judgment and subsequent punishment
regarding a man's homosexuality with his slave is the same
as if it had been done to any other type of person.

207

Is it possible to treat this or any other incurable disease?

Is there be any possible way to treat a harmful virus?
Could a person intoxicated with infatuation regain his/her
consciousness and repossess his/her heart once more?
The answer is yes, as this positive answer comes from the
Hadith: "Whatever disease Allah ~ has sent down, He ~ has
(also) appointed a cure for it." 1
There are two ways of treating the disease of a heart
corrupted with lust:
First, stop its cause before it becomes established as a habit.
Second, removing the problem, before it dominates one's
mind.
Both ways are easy for one who gains the Support of Allah
~. but are difficult for one who is not supported by Allah ~The way to stop this condition, before it settles in the heart,
is to lower one's gaze (from looking at the unlawful), as
mentioned in previous chapters, because gazing is one of the
arrows of Iblis (Satan), so whoever freely releases his gaze,
would suffer perpetual regret.
There are many benefits oflowering one's gaze:
( 1) It is in compliance with the Commandments of Allah
~ and a good opportunity for a person in his/her life.
In fact, there is nothing more beneficial to one in this

world and the Hereafter than to try one's utmost to
comply with the Commandments of Allah ~ (2) It prevents the effect of the poisonous arrow (of
Satan) from reaching its target (the heart of man).
(3) It keeps the heart in the harmonious company of
Allah ~ - By freeing one's eyesight from all
restrictions, it is given the opportunity to see the
unlawful, which would scatter one's heart and
distance it from Allah ~ - Letting one's gaze loose
generates the separation of the heart from Allah ~ (4) It strengthens one's heart and lightens it, just as
loosening one's gaze weakens it and burdens it.
(5) It brightens the heart, and it is for this reason that
Allah ~ mentioned the Verse about light just after
mentioning the Commandment to lower one's gaze;
He ~ said: ( Say to the believers to lower their eyes
and safeguard their private parts) 2 then He ~
said: ( Allah is the Light of the heavens and the
earth. The parable of His Light is as a niche and
within it a lamp) 3 i.e. an example of His Light is the
heart; whenever His Believing Servant complies to
His Commandments and His Prohibitions. Whenever
the heart of a believer lights up, good fortune appears
before him/her from all sides, however when one's
heart settles in darkness, all aspects of evil and
difficulty surround him/her from all sides.
(6) It inherits a truthful acumen to distinguish between
truth and falsehood. Shuja' Al-Karamani used to
say: "If a person follows the Sunnah and is mindful
of Allah ~ . by lowering his gaze from the unlawful,

and observes only what is lawful, his insight will not
fail him." When a man abstains from something, in
compliance with the Divine Commandments, Allah
~ would replace whatever he/she missed by giving
him/her good judgment, earned by developing good
insight in the heart.
(7) One's heart would develop firmness, strength and
power. It is said: "Whoever opposes his low desires,
Satan fears (approaching) his shadow." On the
contrary, you will find that one who follows his own
desires has a low and disgraceful self, which Allah ~
gives to those who disobey Him. Allah ~ said: (But
honour, power and glory belong to Allah, His
Messenger, and the believers) 1 and He ~ said: (So
do not become weak, nor be sad, and so you would
become superior, if you were indeed true
believers.) 2 Faith is in words and actions; internally
and externally; as Allah ~ said: (Whoever desires
honour, power and glory, then to Allah belong all
Honour, Power and Glory. To Him ascend all the
goodly words, and righteous deeds exalt it) 3 i.e.
those who desire honour, power and glory should
seek it through their obedience to Allah ~ , with
goodly words followed with good deeds. In the
supplication of Qunuut4, we ask Allah: "Surely, he to
whom You show allegiance is never abased, and he
whom You take as an enemy is never honoured."

(8) It blocks the way for Satan to enter into the heart.
Indeed, Satan slips inside at the time of an unlawful
look and goes straight to the heart, in an instant.
Satan then starts to beautify an image before the
gazer, in such a way that he/she would become
besotted by it, as his/her heart would become
inflamed with passion. It is for the reason that the
punishment for those who desire to look at unlawful
pictures is that Allah ~ would prepare for them, in
the "interval world" (of the grave) between one's
death and resurrection, a fire-pit in which their souls
would be cast until the Day of Resurrection. This
was reported by the Prophet ~ in an authentic Hadith
(from Al-Bukhari and Muslim), following a vision
that was given to him by Allah ~ (9) It helps the heart focus on its benefits, because letting
the gaze loose would no doubt make the heart forget
its duty, and would also give one's base self the
chance to follow its own desires, away from the
remembrance of its Lord. Allah ~ said: ( Do not
obey him whose heart We have made heedless of
Our Remembrance, and who follows his own
lusts, and whose affair has been lost.) 5
(10)
There is a way linking the eyesight to one ' s
heart, so if one's heart is corrupted, the eyesight
becomes corrupted, and vice versa. When one's heart
is corrupted, it is no longer suitable to accommodate
the Love and the Company of Allah ~
A second way to stopping this disease before it settles in the
heart is to occupy one's heart with the Love and
5

Surat AI-Kahf, Verse 28.

211

Remembrance of Allah ~- It is only common sense that
when the self unties its bond with a beloved subject, it
searches for a replacement that is higher in status. However,
it needs to possess two qualities:
First, good judgment to distinguish between beloved and
reprehensible levels of love, and so it may be possible to
select the highest of the beloved levels from the lowest, and
to bear the lowest of the reprehensible, in order to save
oneself from its highest. This is an intellectual duty, so
whoever acts differently would have a lower status than
animals.
Second, there should be a strong determination to enable one
to make the good choice and give up the bad one. Allah ~
denied the Imamah (leadership in Islam) to everyone, except
those with patience and certainty; He ~ said: (We made
from among them leaders, giving guidance under Our
Command, when they were patient and used to believe
with certainty in Our Signs.)1

The heart cannot combine both the love for Allah and the
passion for pictures.
It is necessary to understand that the love of Allah cannot co-

exist with the love of whatever is unlawful; they are
opposites which cannot be combined. It is inevitable that
one would expel the other.

I

Surat As-Sajdah, Verse 24.

212

The power of love should be devoted to Allah ~ . Alone,
with no partners; any other love should only exist for the
Sake of Allah ~Any other love, which is devoted to others besides Allah ~ .
would become a torment for its possessor. Allah ~ does not
forgive His Servants for associating anything with Him in
this love, but forgives other sins of whomsoever He wills.
The love of pictures exceeds the love of what is beneficial or
non-beneficial for the Servant of Allah; therefore; he/she has
to choose between these two loves, because both of them
cannot co-exist in the same heart.
Whoever turns away from the Love of Allah ~ and from the
desire to meet Him, Allah ~ tries him/her with the love for
others, to punish him/her with this invalid love, in this world
and in the Hereafter. He ~ punishes him/her with the love
of idols, or the love of the cross, or the love of women/men,
or the love of relatives, or the love of what is disgraceful and
vile.
Indeed, whoever does not take Allah ~ as His God, has
taken his/her vain desire as his/her god; Allah ~ has said:
( Have you see him who takes his own lust as his god?
And Allah knowing such, left him astray, and sealed his
hearing and his heart, and put a cover on his sight. Who
then will guide him after Allah? Will you not then
remember?)2

2

Surat Al-Jathiyah, Verse 23 .

213

Worship is a degree oflove
The characteristic of worship is love, with submission and
humiliation, of the beloved. Whoever loves something and
his/her heart submits to it, then his/her heart is actually
worshipping it.
The levels of this love are:
The bond of love, which is called a bond because the lover is
so fond of the beloved, and thus tied down.
Ardent love, as this love is poured towards the beloved.
Infatuation, as this love is closely attached to the heart. This
meaning was used by Allah ~ to describe the punishment in
Hell for the disbelievers: (Its torment is ever an
inseparable, permanent punishment.) 3
Passion, which is an excess of love; a description which is
not suitable for the Status of Allah ~Longing, which is the journey of the heart to its beloved; this
was mentioned, with regard to Allah ~' in a supplication of
the Prophet :i: "O Allah! I ask You, with the longing and
. to meet y ou, . .. ,,1

desire of the Righteous Servants who long to meet Me; but
My desire to meet them is even stronger." This is the

Surat Al-Furqan, Verse 65.
Recorded by Ahmad, on the authority of Ammar bin Yaser~.

214

meaning that the Prophet ~ mentioned in the Hadith:
"Whoever loves meeting Allah, Allah loves to meet him." 2
The scholars have said, interpreting the Verse, (Whoever
hopes for the Meeting with Allah, then Allah's Term is
surely coming), 3 that when Allah ~ knew about the strong
desire of His Righteous Servants to meet Him, and that their
hearts would not have been fully guided until they met Him.
So He ~ set an appointed time for them to meet Him, in
order to calm their souls. The best and most savoured life is
that of those longing to meet their Lord. Their life is really a
good life, as there is no more blessed or peaceful life than
that. It is the good life mentioned by Allah ~: (Whoever
works righteousness - whether male of female - while he
(or she) is a true believer, verily, to him We will give a
good life)4. This does not refer to the life that is shared
between believers and disbelievers, righteous and
wrongdoers, such as having good food, clothing, weddings and perhaps even the Enemies of Allah exceed in these
blessings, more than the believers. The good life mentioned
by Allah ~ is that which makes the believer's heart focus
only on pleasing Him, Alone, in all his/her actions. The
Prophet ~ reported that Allah ~ said: "Whosoever shows
enmity to someone devoted to Me, I shall be at war with
him. My servant draws not near to Me with anything more
loved by Me than the religious duties I have enjoined upon
him, and My servant continues to draw near to Me with
nawajil (extra optional duties), so that I shall love him.

In this Hadith, Allah ~ defined the reasons for his/her love
of two things: performing His Prescribed Religious Duties,
and striving to get closer to Him with optional duties.
When a person continues to perform optional religious duties
(such as extra prayers and fasting) out of love for Allah ~'
he/she becomes one of the Dearly Beloved Servants of
Allah, and when a person reaches this state, his/her heart
would never be directed to love anyone else more than
Allah ~ Allah ~ specified the hearing, eyesight, hands and feet in
this Hadith because they are the means of perception and
action. The hearing and eyesight provide the willpower for
the heart (to do an action) or the dislike (of doing it), love
and hate; and after that a person uses his/her hands and feet.
If the hearing and eyesight of a person are perceived with
(mindfulness of) Allah, his/her perception would be well
safeguarded, and also his/her love and hate would be well
preserved. It is this Company of Allah with His Righteous

Servant which is special, and this is stressed in the following
Verses:

( Do not be sad (or afraid), surely Allah is with us) 1
(Allah is with the Muhsinun (good-doers)) 2
( Truly, Allah is with those who fear Him and those who
are Muhsinun (good-doers.) 3
(Be patient.

Surely, Allah is with those who are

(Nay, verily with me is my Lord. He will guide me.) 5
(Do not be afraid, verily, I am with you both, hearing
and seeing.); 6 speaking to Musa (Moses) and Harun ~I.
It is this Company with Allah ~ which eases all the complex
situations from a believer, and turns all his/her fears into
safety and serenity. With the Company of Allah ~, a
believer overcomes all his/her worries and anxieties, so
whatever is distant and unattainable becomes close and
attainable.
Without the Company of Allah, a person's heart would
become like a fish out of water, turning and struggling until
it gets back into the water, where it regains its life again.

Allah ~ mentioned the most honoured of all His Creation
and the most beloved to Him £ ; His Messenger Muhammad
:i in the highest status of worship - i.e. calling people to
worship Allah ~. Alone, and declaring his Prophethood,
when Allah ~ said:

(When the Servant of Allah (Muhammad :I) stood up
invoking Him (His Lord -Allah) in prayer, they (the
Jinn) just made round him a dense crowd, as if sticking
one over the other, (in order to listen to the Prophet's
recitation)) 7
(If you are in doubt concerning that which We have sent
down to Our Servant (Muhammad :I) then bring a Surah
of the like thereof) 8

(Glorified (and Exalted) is He (Allah), Who took His
Servant (Muhammad :I) for a journey, by night, from
Al-Masjid Al-Haram to Al-Masjid AI-Aqsa) 9
Allah ~ created His Creation in order to worship Him,
Alone, without associated partner with Him, as this is the
most perfect type of love and submission to Him £ . This is
true Islam, the religion of Ibrahim ~1, as Allah ~ said:
(Who turns away from the Religion of Ibrahim, except
him who befools himself? Truly, We chose him in this
world and verily, in the Hereafter he will be among the
righteous. When his Lord said to him: "Submit (i.e. be a
Muslim!)" He said: "I have submitted myself (as a

Muslim) to the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind and jinn
and all that exists)", and this submission to Allah was
enjoined by Ibrahim, upon his sons, and by Ya'qub
(Jacob), saying: "0 my sons! Allah has chosen for you
the True Religion, then do not die except in the Faith of
Islam." Or were you witnesses when death approached
Ya'qub? When he said to his sons: "What will you
worship after me?" They said: "We shall worship your
God, the God of your fathers, Ibrahim, lsma'il (Ishmael),
Ishaq (Isaac); One God; and to Him we submit (in
Islam).) 1
It is for this reason that the worst of all sins is polytheism,
the basis of which is not devoting all one's love for Allah~.
Allah ~ has said: (And of mankind are some who take

(for worship) others besides Allah, as rivals (to Allah).
They love them as they love Allah. But those who believe
love Allah more.)2
True worship cannot be achieved by assoc1atmg partners
with Allah, in this love. This is contrary to having love for
the Sake of Allah, which is a fundamental aspect of
worshipping Allah. In fact, to love the Prophet ~. or rather
love him before ourselves, our fathers and sons, is necessary
to complete one's faith, because loving the Prophet ~ is a
part of having love for Allah ~. The Prophet ~ said:
"Whoever possesses the (following) three qualities will have
the sweetness of faith ( 1): The one for whom Allah and His
Messenger become dearer than anything else; (2) Whoever
loves a person and he loves him only for Allah's Sake; (3)

whoever hates to revert to atheism (disbelief) as he would
hate to be thrown into the Fire."3
The Prophet~ said: "If anyone loves for Allah's Sake, hates
for Allah's Sake, gives for Allah's Sake, and withholds for
Allah's Sake, he would have perfect faith.',4
This type of love is one of the prerequisites for having love
for Allah; the stronger it is, the more powerful is its
foundation.

Types of love
There are four types of love, which should be distinguished
from eachother, and whosoever is not able to differentiate
between them is indeed led astray.

First, love for Allah; this alone is not enough to save man
from the Punishment of Allah, and to receive His Reward,
for the polytheists and those who worship the Cross (the
Christians) and the Jews claim to love Allah.
Second, to love what Allah ~ loves. It is this type which
enters a person into Islam and removes him from polytheism.
The dearest of people to Allah are those who observe this
kind of love well.

Third, to love for Allah's Sake, which ts one of the
prerequisites of loving what He ~ loves.
Fourth, to direct one' s love to others besides Allah; loving
Allah ~ and other idols at the same time. This is the love of
polytheists. Whoever loves others along with Allah, not for
the Sake of Allah, then he has taken them as other gods
besides Allah.
There is another fifth type of love, which is not part of our
subject. It is man's natural love for things which are suitable
to his nature; such as the love of the thirsty person for water,
and the hungry one for food; the love of sleep, one's wife
and children. These are types of love which are not
criticised, unless they distract a man from remembering
Allah ~ . and from loving Him. Allah ~ said: ( 0 you who
believe! Let not your properties nor your children divert
you from the remembrance of Allah) 1 and He ~ also said:
(Men whom neither sale nor trade diverts from the
remembrance of Allah.) 2
Al-Khullah (the perfect love in friendship)

This is intimate friendship, characterised by perfect love,
belonging to a heart which has no place for others besides
his/her beloved one. It is a position which does not accept
sharing, of any kind. This position is special for the khalilan
(two intimate friends) of Allah ~ : Ibrahim ~\ and

I

Surat AI-Munafiqun, Verse 9.
Surat An-Nur, Verse 37.

221

Muhammad ~' as the Prophet~ said: "Allah has taken me as
a khalil, just as he had taken Ibrahim as a khalil. " 3
The Prophet ~ also said: "If I were to take a khalil, I would
have taken Abu Bakr, but he is my brother and my
companion in Islam."
He ~ also said: "I am innocent from any khalil for his
intimate friendship, (besides his love of Allah ~)" 4
When Ibrahim ~\ asked his Lord for a child, even at an
advanced age, he was given Isma' il ~\. The heart of
Ibrahim was besotted with love for his new child, so Allah ~
wanted to test Ibrahim and see - while He ~ is the AllKnower of everything, seen and unseen - if the intimate
friendship between them had been affected by the arrival of
the new child; so He ~ ordered Ibrahim, in a dream, to
slaughter his son. It was a divine Command, coming as a
real vision, which became a great test for Ibrahim ~\. The
aim was not to slaughter his son, in reality, but to slaughter
the excessive love that Ibrahim had for his son in his heart,
so that his heart would stay fully devoted to Allah ~- When
Ibrahim ~\ set about slaughtering his son, placing the love
for Allah before of the love for his son, the intended mission
had been achieved and so Allah ~ ransomed the son for the
great sacrifice (of a sheep).
Some people are wrong when they think that love could be
more perfect than Khullah (intimate friendship), and that

222

Ibrahim ~ \ was a Khalil of Allah, while Muhammad was a
dear and beloved one of Allah. The term "love" has a
general context, while "Khullah" is more specific; AlKhullah is the end and outcome of sincere love. The Prophet
~ has informed that Allah ~ had taken him and Ibrahim as
His two Khalils. He~ denied that he had any khalil besides
his Lord, while at the same time declaring his love for
' Aishah, for her father Abu Bakr, for 'Umar bin Al-Khattab,
and others.
Allah ~ also declares His love for His righteous people,
saymg:

(Truly, Allah loves those who turn to Him in repentance,
and loves those who purify themselves) 5
(Allah loves the Patient) 6
(Allah loves the good-doers) 7
( Verily, Allah loves those who act justly.) 8

Performing an act or abandoning it is a matter of choice
The choice as to whether or not to do an act is based on the
benefit that is achieved from it, or the relief it produces after
the removal of pain. This choice has been taken by
reasonable people as well as animals. However, many
people wrong themselves badly when they only think of

achieving satisfaction, even if it is subsequently followed by
a great suffering. This is the case of short-sighted people;
those who think only of satisfaction in the present and ignore
any bad consequences in the future.
The most reasonable person is one who prefers a lasting,
peaceful state of mind to the ephemeral, short-lived
satisfactions of life. A foolish person is one who exchanges
Eternal Blessings, a good, lasting life and perfect satisfaction
for brief and fading satisfaction, troubled with sufferings,
fears and anxieties.
The only way to achieve real satisfaction is to tum to Allah
~ ' Alone, and seek His Pleasure, in every action. In this
way, if a person had missed out on anything in this world,
he/she would indeed have earned his/her great chance, which
cannot be missed, of achieving Peace in the Hereafter; and if
he/she had not missed anything in this world, while
remaining in total obedience to Allah ~, then he/she would
have achieved both satisfactions, in this world and the
Hereafter. This is the way to one's happiness, with Success
from Allah ~ .
Love is the basis of every action
Love is the basis of every activity, whether in truth or
falsehood, and the basis of all Islamic activities is having
love for Allah ~ and His Messenger ~ . just as the basis of
the Revelation (the Qur 'an and the Sunnah) is having belief
in Allah and His Messenger.

Any feeling that prevents the perfection of this love for Allah
and His Messenger, competing with this love, is indeed
opposed to the basis of Faith and weakens its base. If it is

224

strengthened until it opposes the basis of the love of Allah or
the belief in the Revelation, it becomes a form of polytheism
which negates one's Faith. If it does not oppose it, it impairs
its credible perfection.
Therefore, real friendship in Islam is not achieved, except by
showing enmity to the Enemies of Allah ~ - Allah ~ stated
that Ibrahim :%§1 questioned his people: ( Do you observe

that which you have been worshipping, you and your
ancient fathers? Verily, they are enemies to me, except
the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that
exists).) 1
Ibrahim, the Khalil of Allah, did not establish his real
intimate friendship with Allah, until he declared his enmity
towards those of his people who worshipped deities besides
Allah ~ - There is no friendship except for Allah' s Sake, and
there is no friendship except by declaring one's freedom
from anything worshipped besides Him £.
For Allah ~ said: ( Indeed, there was an excellent example

for you in Ibrahim and those with him, when they said to
their people: "Verily, we are free from you and whatever
you worship besides Allah; we have rejected you, and
there has appeared between us and you hostility and
hatred, for ever, until you believe in Allah, Alone.") 2 and
He ~ said: ( Remember when Ibrahim said to his father
and his people: "Verily, I am innocent of what you
worship, except Him (i.e. I worship none but Allah,
Alone), Who did create me; and verily, He will guide me"

and he made it a Word, lasting among his offspring, that
they may turn back (to Allah)) 3 i.e. he ~1 made friendship
for Allah's Sake and freedom from anything worshipped
besides Allah as a lasting "word", to be inherited by the
prophets and followers after him; this word is the testimony
of Faith: (la ilaha illallah - none has the right to be
worshipped but Allah, Alone). It was the "word" upon
which the heavens, earth and religion were established. It
was for this "word" that the Qiblah 1 was fixed and the
Swords of Jihad were raised. It is the "word" which
safeguards one's blood, property in the Muslim land, and
rescues one from the Punishment of the grave. No one
would enter Paradise without it; it is the Word of Islam, and
the key to the House of Peace, the House of Faith. It
distinguishes a house of blessings from one of torments and
hardships. It is the pole carrying religious obligations and
the Sunnah, for he whose last word was la-ilaha-illallah
enters Paradise.
The essence of this "word" and its secret is: to single out
Allah, to Whom belongs all Sovereignty and Praise, with
Love, Praise and Glorification. To love none but Him; to
ask none but Him; to rely on none but Him; to desire to
please none but Him; to fear none but Him; to swear by no
other name but His; to repent only to Him; to obey only His
Command; to ask for salvation only from Him; to prostrate
to none but Him; to sacrifice (an animal) only to Him. All
this can be combined in one word: to worship none but Him
~ Alone . This is the realization of the Testimony of Faith,
(la ifaha illallah).

226

It is for this reason that Allah ~ forbade the Hell-Fire for the
one who establish this Testimony of Faith in their lives and
stand by it, as Allah ~ said: ( Those who stand firmly upon
their testimonies.) 2 A believer stands firmly upon his/her
testimony in his/her heart, where it is in the same position as
the spirit is in the body. A sick person is one close to death,
whereas a spirit observing the health of the body is alive. So
the life of this spirit depends upon the life of this word (by
having the Testimony of Faith within it), just as the life of
the body depends upon the existence of the spirit within it.

Whoever has lived his life holding firmly to this "word" and
observing its obligations, his/her spirit would enjoy its new
destined good life in Paradise, for Allah ~ has said:
(As for him who feared standing before his Lord, and
restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts,
verily, Paradise is his abode.) 3
( Whoever works righteousness - whether male or female
- while he (or she) is a true believer, verily, to him We
will give a good life)4
(No doubt! Verily, the auliya' of Allah (i.e. those who
believe in the Oneness of Allah, fearing and loving Him
much), no fear shall come upon them nor shall they
grieve; those who believe and used to fear Allah much;
for them are glad tidings, in the life of the present world

and in the Hereafter. No change can there be in the
Words of Allah. This is indeed the supreme success.) 5
The believer who is sincere in his/her worship of Allah is the
one of those people who enjoys the best life, most restful
mind, most open heart, most cheerful heart, which is a type
of paradise in this world (for him/her) before the one in the
Hereafter.
Anas bin Malik ~ reported that the Prophet ;i said: "When
you come upon the pastures of Paradise feed on them ." On
being asked what the pastures of Paradise were, he ~ replied
that they were circles where Allah was remembered." 6 He ~
also said: "The distance between my home and my pulpit is a
pasture of Paradise." 7
There is nothing more beneficial to the believer than turning
to Allah ~ ' in every matter, remembering Him and working
hard to please Him, in order to enjoy His Love.
The Prophet ~ reported that Allah ~ said: "Son of Adam! I
have created you to worship Me, so do not waste your time
playing around. I have taken charge of your blessings and
provisions, so you do not tire yourself. Son of Adam! Call
Me and you will find Me, and if you find Me, you find
everything; but if you miss Me, you miss everything; for I
am more beloved to you than anything else."

Types of love
Love or attachment is a name, of which there are many types
differing in their degree and description. The type most
mentioned, with regards to Allah ~ ' is the one which is only
suitable for Allah's Status (and not to anyone or anything
else), such as worship and devotion to Him, Alone.
The term love can be mentioned in its general context, as in
the Verses:

( Allah will bring people, whom He wills, and they will
love Him.) 1
(And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others
besides Allah, as rivals. They love them (as much) as
they love Allah.) 2
The worst love, which is categorically prohibited in Islam, is
to have an equal love for others besides Allah; while the
greatest type of love is to love Allah, Alone, and to love
whatever He ~ loves. This is the basis of happiness in this
world and the Hereafter, which saves one from any
punishment. The prohibited love, which is a type of
polytheism, is the basis of torment in this world and the
Hereafter.
Those who love Allah ~ and worship Him, Alone, do not
enter the Hell-Fire, and if they ever enter it because of some
sins, none of them would stay in it.
1

2

Surat Al-Ma'idah, Verse 54.
Surat Al-Baqarah, Verse 165.

229

The Qur'an is centred on this commandment of love and its
obligations, and on the prohibition of the other type and its
requirements. It gives examples and stories of both types,
with details of their devotees. It also gives the conditions of
both types in the three worlds: the condition in this world,
the condition in the grave, and the condition in the Hereafter.
The basis of the Message of all the prophets ~1 is to worship
Allah ~ ' Alone, without partners; such a worship which
comprises the perfection of love, submission, humiliation,
praise and glorification to Him £ , along with obedience and
fear as necessary prerequisites.
Anas bin Malik ~ reported that the Prophet ~ said: "By Him
in Whose Hand my soul is, none of you will not have
complete faith, till I am dearer to him than his son, his father
and all people." 3
Abdullah bin Hisham ~ said: "We were with the Prophet
while he was holding the hand of 'Umar bin Al-Khattab.
'Umar said to Him: ' O Messenger of Allah! You are dearer
to me than everything except my own self.' The Prophet ~
said: 'No, by Him in Whose Hand my soul is, you will not
have complete faith, till I am dearer to you than your own
self.' Then 'Umar said to him: 'However, now, by Allah,
you are dearer to me than my own self.' The Prophet ~ said:
'Now, 0 ' Umar, (you are a believer). " '4 If this is the case
for loving the Prophet ~ and the obligation to place his love
before that for one's child, father and all people, then what

about the love due to the One Who sent Muhammad ~ as
His Messenger?

Love stands behind every determination and action
Love remains the basis behind every action and its effective
cause.
There are three types of actions: a chosen action, a natural
one, and a compelled one.
The basis of a natural action is a state of static equilibrium,
for the body moves only when it leaves its natural state of
balance and returns to this state when an action is finished.
A chosen action which relies on one's will power, is the
basis of the other types of actions, for it relates to will power
and love.
The best example of this concept is in the actions both in the
heavens and on the earth, such as the movements of the
galaxies, stars, wind, clouds, rain, plants, embryos in their
wombs; they are all executed by the appointed angels who
arrange to obey the Commands of Allah ~ ' such as
distributing His Blessings (by His Command). This is
mentioned in the Qur'an and the Sunnah, and it is derived
from the belief in the Angels, as one of the precepts of Faith.
In fact, Allah ~ has appointed angels for the wombs (to take
care of any new coming baby), angels for the rain, angels for
vegetation, angels for the wind, angels for the stars, angels
for the mountains, and for the clouds which carry rain to any
specific destination. Allah ~ also appointed four angels for
every person (two writers - one on his/her right and one on

231

his/her left recording all his/her words and actions - and two
protectors - one in front of him/her and one behind him/her).
He ~ also appointed angels to take away a person ' s spirit (at
his/her death) and prepare its new dwelling in Paradise or in
Hell; angels to question him/her (after his/her death) and test
him/her in the grave, where he/she would either blessed or
tormented; angels to take him/her to the Gathering Place,
when he/she rises from his/her grave; angels to punish
him/her in Hell, or bless him/her in Paradise.
The angels are the soldiers of Allah ~ . and the term "angel"
just means messenger, executing the Commands of Allah ~ .
without having any decision in the matter. The whole matter
belongs to Allah ~. Alone. The angels are simply
implementing the Divine Commands.
Allah ~ said, informing about them:

( We (angels) do not descend except by the Command of
your Lord (0 Muhammad :I). To Him belongs what is
before us and what is behind us, and what is between
those two; and your Lord is never forgetful) 1
( There are many angels in the heavens, whose
intercession will avail nothing, except after Allah has
given leave to whom He wills and is pleased with.) 2
Allah ~ has sworn by a number of His Angels who execute
His Commands, saying:

I

2

Surat Maryam, Verse 64.
Surat An-Najm, Verse 26.

232

( By those (angels) arranged in rows. By those (angels)
who drive the clouds in a good way. By those (angels)
who deliver the Book and the Qur'an from Allah to
mankind.) 1
( By the winds (or angels or the Messengers of Allah) sent
forth, one after another. By the winds that blow
violently. By the winds that scatter clouds and rain. By
the (Verses of the Qur'an) that separate the right from
the wrong. By the angels that deliver the Revelations of
the Messengers, to cut off all excuses or warn.) 2
( By those (angels) who pull out (the souls of the
disbelievers and the wicked) with great violence. By
those (angels) who gently take out (the souls of the
believers). By those that swim along (i.e. angels or
planets in their orbit). By those (angels) who arrange to
do the Commands of their Lord.) 3
All those movements and actions are the angels ' worship of
Allah ,g, It is their love of Allah which makes them execute
His Commands willingly; and it is this love which makes the
heavens and the earth glorify their Lord ( The seven heavens

and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him; for
there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you
understand not their glorification. Truly, He is Ever
Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving.)4

Therefore, every living or moving thing has a will, love and
action accorded to it, and all the existing parts in this
universe would not be useful unless their movements and
love were devoted for their Creator, Alone, just as their
existence itself is due only to His Exclusive Creativity.
It is for this reason that Allah ~ said: (Had there been

therein (in the heavens and the earth) gods besides Allah,
then verily both would have been ruined.) 1

Indeed, if there were two gods for this world, its system
would have been in chaos, as each god would have sought to
overcome the other or destroy him, in order to be singled out
as the only true deity, and because sharing with another deity
is a shortcoming in a deity's perfection.
A god would never be pleased to have a shortcoming; so if
one destroyed the other, he would be the only god, while the
other defeated one could no longer be described as god. But
if none should overcome the other, then they both would
have a defect, and there should be a stronger god above
them, otherwise each one of them would take what he had
created and use it to overcome the other. This situation
would lead to the destruction of all that existed in the
heavens and the earth, just like the damage which is left in a
country where there were two kings fighting eachother for
the throne!
Therefore, the righteousness of the heavens and the earth,
and the perfect system that organises the existence of all
creatures, is manifest proof that there is no god but Allah ~ '
1

Surat Al-Anbiya', Verse 22.

234

Alone, without any associate; to Him belongs all sovereignty
and praise; He gives life and causes death; and He is
Omnipotent over all things. Allah ~ said: (No son did
Allah beget, nor is there any god along with Him. If
there had been many gods, then each god would have
taken away what he had created, and some would have
tried to overcome others! Glorified is Allah above all that
they attribute to Him!) 1

(Or have they taken (for worship) gods from the earth
who raise the dead? Had there been therein (in the
heavens and the earth) gods besides Allah, then verily
both would have been ruined. Glorified is Allah, the
Lord of the Throne, (High is He) above all that they
associate with Him! He cannot be questioned as to what
He does, while they will be questioned.) 2
(Say: If there had been other gods along with Him as
they assert, then they would certainly have sought out a
way to the Lord of the Throne.) 3

The effects of love
Love carries with it many consequences, effects and
requirements; whether praiseworthy or reprehensible, useful
or harmful; in passion, taste, sweetness, desire, company,
communication, closeness, separation, abandonment,
happiness, sadness, etc.

attracts all good to its owner in this world and the Hereafter
to establish his/her happiness. Whereas, harmful love is one
which attracts all that is damaging to its owner in his/her
world and in his/her Hereafter to establish a life of torment
for him/her.
Any reasonable person would not choose what is harmful for
him/her, and if he/she ever did, it would have been out of
ignorance, because sometimes the self wants to discover
what is harmful, which leads a person to become unjust to
him/herself.
When a person chooses what is harmful to him/her in his/her
life, his/her choice is either based on a wrong belief or a bad
desire. This is the case of those who follow their conjectures
and those things which they themselves desire.
The emotional effects (of sadness or happiness) of the
praiseworthy love, which earn the believer rewards, are all
useful to him/her, whereas those of the reprehensible love
earn him/her nothing but loss and harm.
This is the consequence of every action, either done in
obedience to Allah ~ or in disobedience to Him. For Allah
~ said:

( That is because they suffer no thirst, nor fatigue, nor
hunger in the Cause of Allah, nor do they take any step
to raise the anger of disbelievers, nor inflict any injury
upon an enemy, but it is written to their credit as a deed
of righteousness. Surely, Allah does not waste the
reward of the good-doers. Nor do they spend anything

236

(in Allah' Cause) - small or great - nor cross a valley,
but is written to their credit, that Allah may recompense
them with they best of what they used to do.) 1
Love is the basis of every religion
Religion is both an inner and manifest deed; and love and
will form the basis of all those deeds. Religion is defined as
obedience to Allah, worship of Allah, and good character
beloved to Allah ~ - It is the necessary and continuous
obedience (to Allah), which has become the character of
Islam. It is for this reason that having good character has
been interpreted as the true way of religion, in the Verse:
(Verily, you (0 Muhammad) are on an exalted standard
of character.) 2
lbn 'Abbas ~ said that he had asked 'Aishah $ about the
character of the Prophet ~' to which she replied: "His
character was the Qur'an."
One's inner belief necessitates true love and submission, in
worshipping Allah ~. whereas one's manifest belief does
not necessarily require this love, despite the fact that there
are signs of obedience and humiliation in all the visible
actions of worship.
Allah ~ called the Day of Resurrection, the Day of the
Religion (Yawm-ud-Deen); it is the Day on which people are
judged for their deeds, and receive good rewards for their

I

2

Surat Tawbah, Verse 120.
Surat Al-Qalam, Verse 4.

237

good deeds, and punishment for their bad deeds. It is also
called the Day of Requital or the Day of Reckoning.
Allah ~ said: (Then why do you not, if you are exempt
from this reckoning and recompense, bring back the soul
to its body if you are truthful?) 1
This Verse was revealed to all those who deny the
resurrection and reckoning; they are disbelievers because
they deny God His Omnipotence, Godliness and Wisdom.
Allah ~ challenges them to stop the Angel of Death from
taking away their soul in their dying moments, or to bring it
back again once it is taken away.
Islam is a legislative and commanding religion, and the
Religion of the Reckoning and Recompense of the Day of
Resurrection.
Allah ~ only commands what He loves and is pleased with,
so whatever He ~ hates and dislikes He prohibits.
Therefore, Islam, the Religion of Allah, is all based upon
Allah ' s Love and Pleasure.
The Prophet ~ said: "He would relish the flavour of faith
(Iman) , whoever became pleased with Allah as Lord, with alIslam as the code of life, and with Muhammad as the
Messenger of Allah." 2

238

Islam stands firmly with love, for which reason it has been
prescribed and legislated, and upon which it is based. Its
reckoning aspect consists of recompensing a good-doer for
his/her beneficence, and an evil-doer for his/her misdeeds, as
both matters are loved by Allah ~' for they are derived from
His Justice and Graciousness, which are Attributes of His
Perfection.
Islam, the Religion of Allah is the Right Path, and Allah ~ is
on the Right Path; in His Commands, Prohibitions, Rewards
and Punishments. Allah ~ has, informed us about His
Prophet Hud ~ ,, who said to his people: ("I call Allah to

witness and bear witness upon you that I am free from
that which you ascribe, as partners in worship with Him.
So plot against me, all of you, and give me no respite. I
put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord! There is
not a moving living creature but He has the grasp of its
forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the Straight Path.") 1
Hud ~I declared his belief in the Omnipotence of Allah ~.
and that he did not fear his disbelieving people, whose
affairs were under the Grasp of Allah~Whenever a Muslim believes that Allah ~ is on the Straight
Path, in all His Divine Decrees, he is no longer scared that he
might be unjustly treated.
The Prophet ~ said: "When a Muslim is afflicted with grief
and distress, and says: 'O Allah, I am Your Servant, son of
Your Servant, son of Your Maidservant, my forelock is in
Your Hand, Your Command over me is forever executed,
I

Surat Hud, Verses 54-56.

239

Your Decree over me is just. I ask You; by every Name
belonging to You, which You named Yourself, or revealed
in Your Book, or that You taught any of Your creation, or
that You have preserved in the Knowledge of the unseen that
is with You; that You make the Qur' an the life of my heart
and the light of my breast, and the departure for my sorrow,
and a release for my anxiety' , Allah ~ removes his worry
and grief from him, and changes them to relief and
pleasure." The Companions said: "Should we learn them?"
He ~ replied: "Yes, every Muslim who has heard them
should learn them." 1

The evH consequences of the passionate desire to look at
illegal pictures
We conclude this book with a detailed chapter about the
present and the future evil consequences of looking at
unlawful pictures, or looking at women' s unveiled faces. It
corrupts the heart, and if the heart is corrupted, all one's
willpower, words and actions would become corrupted, and
so one ' s faith would also be affected, if not corrupted.
Allah ~ mentioned this disease, with regards to the people
of Lut and women. He ~ has informed us of the passionate
desire of the King 's wife for Prophet Yusuf ~ \. He ~
described the way she sought to tempt Yusuf ~\, and the
manner Yusuf ~\ withheld himself with patience, abstinence
and fear of Allah, and indeed it was Allah ~ Who helped

him overcome his test, because it was surely a very difficult
trial for human patience, alone.
The execution of an act depends on one's motivation and the
absence of any obstacle. The motive in Yusuf's case was
very powerful for different reasons:
First, Allah ~ instilled in man's nature an inclination
towards women, just as a thirsty person is drawn to water,
and a hungry person to food, to the extent that many people
could be patient regarding hunger and thirst yet not women,
however this is not rebuked if the inclination is lawful (to
one's wife, for example). Rather, it is praised, as in the
Hadith of Anas 4, who reported that the Prophet ~ said:
"Perfume and women have been made dear to me in this
world. I can be patient about hunger and thirst, but cannot
be patient about them." 1
Second, the fact that Yusuf ~ \ was a young man, and the
passion of the youth is very strong.
Third, Yusuf ~ \ was celibate. He had no wife or slave-girl
to relieve his powerful desire for women.
Fourth, Yusuf ~\ was in another country, where a stranger
could more easily have satisfied his sexual desire in a
manner, which he could not have been able do in his own
country, among his family and relatives.

Recorded by An-Nassai in the book, "Conduct towards Women
concerning Marriage", chapter I, Ahmad in his Musnad (3/ 128, 199,
285).

241

Fifth, the woman who seduced him had both status and
beauty, and each of these qualities is a strong incentive to
accept her offer.
Sixth, the woman was willing and had no objection. As
many people's desire for women is impeded by women's
objections, as they feel humiliated in asking them. However,
other people's desires increase with women's refusal, as they
feel more attracted by those women's soft manner, m
rejecting their offer!
Seventh, it was the king's wife who asked him, tempted him
and made the effort to seduce him, so she spared him all
efforts to show his desire for her.
Eighth, Yusuf ~1 was in her place, under her sovereignty
and rule; for it was feared that if he refused her offer, she
might harm him.
Ninth, there was no worry that she, or anyone from her side,
might denounce him, because she was the one who desired
him, as she locked all the doors behind them.
Tenth, he was publicly seen as her slave in her castle; he
used to enter, go out and be present with her, and no one
ever rebuked him. Their close company strengthened her
desire for him, so this became one of the biggest incentives.
It used to be said to a noble Arab woman (in the pre-Islamic
era): "What incited you to commit adultery?" She replied:
"The closeness of the man's bed and the many secrets
between us."

242

Eleventh, she sought the help of her maids to tempt him, but
he sought the Allah's Help against them, saying: ( Unless
you turn away their plot from me, I will feel inclined
towards them and be one of the ignorant ones.)1
Twelfth, she threatened him with imprisonment and
disgrace, and this was a type of coercion, with which the
incentive of passion got stronger as he had to try to avoid
being detained and disgraced.
Thirteenth, the woman's husband (the King) never showed
any sense of honour or pride in separating his wife from
Yusuf ~1 . Rather, the best he could say was: ( 0 Yusuf,
turn away from this!), and to the woman: ( Ask
forgiveness for your sin, verily you were of the sinful.)
The king certainly lacked self-respect.
Despite that there were all these incentives, Yusuf ~I chose
to please Allah ~. Alone. His love and fear of Allah made
him choose prison rather than commit fornication: (He said:
O my Lord! Prison is dearer to me than that to which
they invite me.) 2
Yusuf ~ 1 knew that it was in his ability to keep himself
away from her invitation, and that if his Lord did not save
him from their temptations, he would have felt inclined
towards them, as this is in his nature as a man. Yusuf's
words showed his perfect knowledge of his Lord and of
himself.

I

Surat Yusuf, Verse 33

243

Lut's people (homosexuals)
As for Lut' s people, Allah ~ mentioned the degree of their
passion, saying: ( The inhabitants of the city came

rejoicing (at the news of the young men's arrival). Lut
said: "Verily, these are my guests, so do not shame me.
Fear Allah, and do not disgrace me." They said: "Did we
not forbid you from entertaining any of the 'Alamin
(people, foreigners and strangers from us)?" Lut said:
"These are my daughters (to marry lawfully) if you must
act so." Verily, by your life (0 Muhammad ii) they were
wandering blindly in their wild intoxication (intoxicated
by their unlawful passion).) 1
These people were blinded by their illegal desire, and their
passion made them forget its harm.
This is a poisonous and crippling condition which has
exhausted all doctors in its treatment. When this state of
mind becomes attached to the heart, its burning passion takes
control to completely dominate it.

Lust leads to polytheism
This can become an aspect of polytheism, because a person's
heart, in some cases, adopts the lover as a rival to Allah ~ ;
he loves him as he loves Allah ~ ; but what about the one
whose love for his lover is greater than his love of Allah ~ ?
This type of love is not to be forgiven; it is a type of
polytheism, and Allah does not forgive polytheism; He ~
1

Surat Al-Hjir, Verses 67-72.

244

forgives those who repent, w1pmg away all aspects of
polytheism in their hearts (i.e. for pure repentance).
One sign of this polytheistic love is that the passionate
person prefers the pleasure of his lover to that of his Lord.
When the rights of his lover are in conflict with the rights of
his Lord, he gives precedence to the right of his lover!
This is the case of many of those who have an illegal passion
for women, and an illegal passion for looking at their
pictures or faces. Put their lustful passion on one side of the
scales and put their Faith of Monotheism on the other, and
then try to make a just measurement that would please Allah
~ and His Messenger.
Many of these people declare publicly that there is no longer
a place in their heart; except for their lover. They have a
predilection for their lover that is stronger than for their
Creator. They have devoted all their love and passion for
their lover and so have none left to worship Allah, knowing
that worshipping Allah requires the perfection in one ' s love
and submission.
The cure for this crippling condition is to know that the
affliction by this ailment, which opposes one's Faith of
Monotheism, comes from one' s ignorance and one ' s heart's
carelessness about remembering Allah ~One first has to learn Allah's Monotheism and its Signs, then
he should perform both the outward and inward acts of
worship, which would occupy his/her heart in the constant
remembrance of Allah ~ - He/she should tum to Allah ~ in

245

humiliation and submission, to seek His Help, in order to
turn that ailment away from him/her.
There is no cure better than being sincere to Allah ~. in all
one's actions. It is the cure mentioned by Allah~. when He
said: (That happened, so We might avert from him all
evil and lust. He was one of Our Chosen (Guided)
Servants.) 1 Allah ~ informed us that He turned Yusuf away
from the evil and illegal sexual intercourse because of his
sincere worship of his Lord.
One should also learn that following Islam and intellect
enable the achievement of benefits for the individual, and
remove or reduce all causes of corruption.
It is known that developing a passion for unlawful gazing at
women or their pictures has neither religious nor worldly
benefit. Rather, its evil consequences are too many to be
counted, so we list but the following aspects:

First, the heart is completely devoted to its lover, and
distracted from loving its Lord ~ or remembering Him. So
is inevitable that one would overcome the other when they
try to gather in the same heart.
Second, the heart would be tortured with it, because
whoever loves something besides Allah ~ . would be
punished by it.

I

Surat Yusuf, Verse 24.

246

Third, the heart becomes a prisoner in the hands of its captor
who could subject it to disgrace. An intoxicated heart
becomes unaware of its humiliation.
Fourth, the heart is distracted from its religious and worldly
benefits.
Fifth, all the ailments of this world and the Hereafter come
rushing towards the heart, which is besotted by lust. Indeed,
as the heart gets closer to satisfy its passion, it becomes
distant from its Lord, and so it falls in the hands of the devil.
Sixth, when lust takes control of the heart, the mind becomes
corrupted with emerging devilish whisperings.
Seventh, this ailment leads to the corruption of the senses, or
at least some of them. In fact when the heart is corrupted,
the eyes, the ears and the tongue also become corrupted. The
eyes no longer see the evil aspects or shortcomings of the
lover. The ears do not listen to the demands of giving up
such an illegal habit, because the one who is involved in an
activity does not see his defect; his ardent love for lust places
a screen over his eyes. The only person, who is aware of it,
is the one who was once involved in it and later gave it up.
It is for this reason that the Companions who embraced
Islam after a life in polytheism were better than those who
were born in Islam.

'Umar bin Al-Khattab ~ said: "The bonds of Islam are
violated, one after the other, by those who were born in
Islam and never witnessed Jahiliyah (the pre-Islamic era)."

247

Eighth, passion is ardent or excessive love; it takes control
of a man's heart and starts to vigorously use both his animal
and mental powers, until his self-destruction occurs. This
has well observed in the course of passion: its beginning is
sweet, its middle is full of worry and anxiety, and its end is
self-destruction.
In the beginning of such passion, the scholars have said that
a person should resist it to his best capability, if it had not
been decreed for him to reach his lover legally (through
marriage). However, if he fails to resist its power, he should
at least keep silent about, and not reveal it to other people,
because he would be violating the sanctity of the lover, and
add more injustice upon himself.

There are many ailments generated by this lustful passion,
which in some cases has led people, who were brought up in
Islam, into polytheism.
Indeed, a Caller to prayer
(Mu 'addhin) once saw a beautiful woman from the roof and
was infatuated by her. So he went down and asked to be her
lover. She replied that she was a Christian, and that she
would marry him if he accepted to embrace her religion. He
accepted, however on the same day, when he climbed a step
on their roof, he fell and died.
When some Christians wanted to tum a Muslim prisoner
away from his religion, they exposed him to a beautiful
woman, and she would then have to attract his attention,
until she took control of his heart. Then she would have to
offer herself to him if he embraced her religion! This would
be in such moment that (Allah will keep firm those who
believe, with the Word that stands firm in this world and

248

in the Hereafter; and Allah will cause to go astray those
who are wrong-doers, and Allah does what He wills.) 1
A reasonable person would not subject himself to this kind
of passionate desire, because it simply leads to evil
consequences. Whoever occupies his mind with lust is
merely deceiving himself and may even destroy it, as had he
not been constantly gazing at the face of his beloved, lust
would not have dominated his heart.
The most beneficial love is that of Allah ~ which is
absolute; that which all hearts are instinctively born with.
This is the secret of the Testimony of Faith, because God is
the One Whom hearts worship with love, glorification, praise
and submission.
Yet worship is not accepted if it is not directed to Allah ~'
Alone, as worship is the perfection of love together with the
perfection of submission and humiliation.
The proof of this obligation to love Allah ~ was mentioned
in all of His Revelations, the Message of His Prophets, and
the natural order endowed by Allah ~ in His Servants.
People's hearts are naturally attracted to love the One Who
bestows His Blessings upon them, as Allah ~ has said:
( Whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is
from Allah. Then, when harm touches you, unto Him
you cry aloud for help.) 2

I

2

Surat Ibrahim, Verse 27.
Surat an-Nahl, Verse 53 .

249

This proof is also evident once His Servants learn His Best
Names and Attributes, which designate His Perfection and
Supremacy.
Love has two attractors: beauty and honour; which Allah ~
possesses to a degree of absolute perfection. He ~ is
graceful and loves grace, as all grace belongs to Him J.;.
Allah ~ said (addressing His Messenger, Muhammad ~ ):
( Say: If you really love Allah, then follow me; Allah will
love and forgive you your sins.) 1 He ~ also said: ( 0 You
who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from
his religion (Islam), Allah will bring a people whom He
will love and they will love Him; humble towards the
believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting in the
way of Allah, and never afraid of the blame of the
blamers. That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on
whom He wills: Allah is All-Sufficient for His Creatures'
Needs, All-Knower.
Verily, your Wali (helper or
protector) is none other than Allah, His Messenger, and
the believers, those who perform Sa/at, and give Zakat,
and bow down with obedience to Allah in prayer.
Whosoever takes Allah, His Messenger, and those who
have believed as Protectors, then the Party of Allah will
be the victorious.)2
The basis of taking someone as a protector is love, just as the
basis of enmity is hatred. Allah ~ is the Wa!T of those who
believe, and they are His Pious People. He ~ loves them,
and He is their WalI according to the level of their love for
Him J.;.
1
2

Surat Al-'Imran , Verse 31.
Surat AI-Ma' idah, Verses 54-56.

250

Allah ~ has censured those who take others as protectors
besides Him £; for He ~ said: ( And of mankind are some
who take others besides Allah as rivals (to Allah). They
love them as they love Allah. But those who believe, love
Allah more (than anything else).) 1 He ~ informed us
about those who take others as rivals to Him (in worship),
when they say to these rivals as they gather in Hell: ( By
Allah, we were truly in manifest error, when we held you
(false gods) as equals (in worship) with the Lord of the
'Alamin. ) 2
With this Monotheism, based on the love of Allah, Allah ~
sent all His Messengers with His Revelations, bearing the
same Message from the First Prophet (Adam ~ \) to the Last
Prophet (Muhammad :i); as it was for its sake that Allah ~
created the heavens and the earth, Paradise and Hell; making
Paradise (as a permanent abode) for the people who love
Him, and Hell (as one) for those who associate rivals to Him.
The Prophet :i swore that a person's faith is not complete
until the Prophet :i becomes dearer to him than his child, his
father and all people; so what about the love of the Lord £ ?
He ~ also said to 'Umar bin Al-Khattab: "No, until I am
dearer to you than your own self' i.e. your faith is not
complete until your Jove reaches this standard!
If the Messenger of Allah is more deserving (to us) than our
own selves, in love and its requirements, then is the Lord £
not more entitled to love than our own selves?
I

Surat Al-Baqarah, Verse 165.
Surat Ash-Shu ' ara ' , Verses 97-98.

251

Allah ~ created man to worship Him, and created for him
everything in the heavens and the earth; is the Lord not
entitled to our love and pleasure (shown by our dedicated
appreciation, awe and worship of Him, Alone)?
He ~ is the Most-Generous; He gives to His Servant even
before His Servant asks Him for anything. He ~ appreciates
the little effort from His Servant, and forgives so many
misdeeds, expiating them. Everything that exists in the
heavens and the earth asks of Him daily, and He ~ listens to
the requests of everyone. He ~ is never confused by all the
numerous requests from all His Servants, and He never gets
annoyed by those who make most insistant supplications.
Instead, He ~ is more pleased with those who repeatedly ask
Him of their needs, and He even dislikes not being asked!
Why do people not love the only One Who brings them good
deeds (by multiplying a believer's good deed by ten) and
removing their bad deeds. He ~ answers invocations,
removes misfortunes, forgives sins and rewards good deeds!
The perfection of love is manifested in the delight, joy and
happiness of the self; and certainly these signs of perfect
love are praiseworthy, if they lead to the greatest eternal
delight, namely that of the Hereafter and its blessings!
Allah ~ said: (Nay, you prefer the life of this world,
although the Hereafter is better and more lasting.) 1
The sorcerers said to Pharaoh, when they believed: ( "So
decree whatever you desire to decree, for you can only
I

Surat Al-A 'la', Verses 16-17.

252

decree regarding this life of the world. Verily, we have
believed in Our Lord, that He may forgive us our faults,
and the magic to which you did compel us; and Allah is
better (as regards reward, in comparison to your reward)
and more lasting.") 1
Allah ~ created mankind and jinn so as to grant them this
eternal delight in the world of the Hereafter; and the best
ever blessing and delight of the Hereafter is that of looking
at the Face of Allah ~ and listening directly to His Words,
and being close to Him ~.
The Prophet ~ said: "Allah ~ would lift the veil , and of all
the things given to them nothing would be dearer to them
than the sight of their Lord, the Mighty and the Glorious." 2
And in another Hadith: "When He ~ appeared to them and
they saw Him, they forgot about all the blessings which they
were enjoying."
The Prophet ~ said in one of his supplications: "I ask You
for the pleasure to look at Your Generous Face, with the
desire to meet You. " 3
The second type of delight is a reprehensible one, which is
opposite to the delight of the Hereafter. It is the delight of
those who take idols as rivals to Allah; they love them and
benefit from one another in this world, as they will try to

We benefited from one another, but now we have
reached our appointed term which you did appoint for
us" He will say: "The Fire is your dwelling place; you
will dwell therein forever, except as Allah may will.
Certainly, your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing." Thus,
We do make the wrong-doers supporters of one another,
because of that which they used to earn.) 1
The delight of sinners, wrong-doers and transgressors is only
here, on earth, yet it is but a gradual lead to their destruction;
Allah ~ said: ( We shall gradually seize them with
punishment in ways they perceive not; for I respite them;
certainly my plan is strong.) 2
Some scholars added to the interpretation of the above Verse
that whenever the transgressors commit a sin, Allah ~
creates a blessing for them, ( until in the midst of their
enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden,
We took them (in punishment), and they were plunged
into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. So, the
root of the people who did wrong was cut off; all Praise
and Thanks are Allah's, the Lord of the 'Alamin.) 3
Allah ~ has said about people of such delight: (Do they
think that in wealth and children We extend to them, We
are hastening to them with good things? No indeed, but
they have no awareness.) 4

He ~ also said about them: ( So do not let their wealth and
children impress you (0 Muhammad :j;); in reality

Allah's Plan is to punish them with these things in the life
of this world, and that their souls shall depart (die) while
they are disbelievers.) '
The third type of delight is one which does not succeed as a
delight of the Hereafter nor generate any punishment; it is
the one which was meant by the Prophet ~' in the Hadith:
"Everything with which a man amuses himself is vain,
except for: his shooting with his bow, his training of his
horse, and his playing with his wife; for they pertain to what
is right. " 2
This love is not censured; it is one of the types of love that is
praiseworthy, as well as love for the Prophet :j;. However,
what we mean here is that love which occupies the heart of
the one who loves; the one who devotes his/her thought and
remembrance to his/her beloved one. Every Muslim has in
his heart a love for Allah and His Messenger which is
necessary for him/her to enter Islam; yet the degree of this
love varies from one to another, and is known only to
Allah ~ It is this love which reduces the pressure of the religious
obligations; it makes the niggardly acts become generous
ones; it puts bravery in the heart of the coward; it purifies the
mind and tames the self; it lightens up the face and delights
the heart.

Likewise, loving the Word of Allah~ (the Qur'an) is a sign
of having love of Allah. If one wants to see the degree of
one's love for Allah, look at the way you love the Qur' an in
your heart; your delight in listening to it, as compared to
other people's delight in listening to music.
It is known that whoever loves a beloved, his/her words and
speech become dearer to him/her than anything else.
'Uthman bin Affan ~ said: "If our hearts were purified, they
would never have enough of the Word of Allah."
One day, the Prophet ~ told Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~ :
"Recite the Qur'an to me." He replied: "Shall I recite it to
you, eventhough it was revealed to you?" The Prophet ~
said: "I like to hear it from others." So he ~ recited Surat
An-Nisa' (The Women), till he reached the Verse (N° 41):
( How (will it be) then when We bring from each nation a
witness, and We bring you (0 Muhammad) as a witness
against these people.) Then the Prophet~ told him: "Stop!"

As for the love of one's spouse(s), there is no blame in this.
It is a blessing that Allah~ has bestowed upon His Servants;
for He ~ said: (Among His Signs is that He created for
you wives from among yourselves, that you may find
repose in them, and He has put between you affection

reflect.) 1
He ~ has made women as a resting place for a man's heart,
and established sincere love and affection between them,
which is love with mercy.
Allah ~ has said, after mentioning what is lawful for men of
women and what is not: ( Allah wishes to make clear (what
is lawful and what is unlawful) to you, and to show you
the ways of those before you, and accept your
repentance; for Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise. Allah
wishes to accept your repentance, but those who follow
their lusts, wish that you (believers) should deviate
tremendously away (from the right Path). Allah wishes
to lighten the burden for you, for man was created weak
(i.e. cannot be patient to leave sexual intercourse with
women)) 2
Jabir bin Abdullah 4, reported that the Prophet :Ji saw a
woman, and so he approached his wife, Zaynab, to fulfil his
desire with her. He then went to his Companions and told
them: 'A woman advances and returns in the shape of a
devil, so when one of you sees a woman, he should approach
his wife, for that would repel whatever he felt in his heart. " ' 3
There are many lessons to be learned from this Hadith: first,

coveted with something of the same nature
it is commanded to heal the passion for any woman
with the best cure, and that is to fulfil one's sexual
desire with the wife. The Prophet ~ said that there is
nothing better for two lovers than marriage 1•
Marrying a beloved woman is the best cure for
passion, which Allah ~ made legal for mankind.
This cure was used by Prophet Dawud %!\\; for he
married a woman whom he loved very much.
As for the story of Zaynab, daughter of Jahsh: her husband
Zayd 4, had decided to divorce her, although she did not
agree. He 4, consulted the Prophet ~ who told him to keep
her. However the Prophet~ learnt that they inevitably were
going to divorce, and kept secret the plan that he was going
to marry her once she had become separated from Zayd,
because he ~ was worried that people might say: "The
Prophet ti married the wife of his son." (As he ~ had
adopted Zayd as a son before the start of his Mission as a
Prophet). Allah ~ wanted to legislate a general legislation
for the benefits of His Servants; so when Zayd 4e, divorced
Zaynab and her 'Jddah 2 period expired, Allah ~ sent the
Prophet ~ to propose to her. Zayd 4e, stood with his back to
the door. The Prophet called her from behind the door: "O
Zaynab, the Messenger of Allah is proposing to you." She
said: "I cannot decide until I ask Allah ~ (in prayer)." She
performed a prayer, and Allah ~ took charge Himself and
concluded their marriage contract above His Throne; with

remarry, after being widowed or divorced (to see whether she is pregnant
or not from her divorced or dead husband).

the Revelation: (So when Zayd had divorced her, We gave
her to you in marriage.) 1 Zaynab used to boast of her
marriage to the Prophet ~ before the other wives of the
Prophet, saying: "Your families conducted your marriage,
but mine was conducted by Allah from above the seven
heavens."
There is no doubt that women were made dear to the Prophet
~. as he said: "Perfume and women have been made dear to
me, but my comfort has been provided by Salah (prayer)." 2
The Prophet ~ interceded for a slave who was passionately
in love with ex-wife, who had refused to return to him, once
she was manumitted. lbn 'Abbas~ said: "Barira's husband
was a slave called Mughith; it is as if I am seeing him now,
going behind Barira and weeping with his tears flowing
down his beard. The Prophet then said to Barira: 'Why don't
you return to him?' She said: 'O Messenger of Allah! Do
you order me to do so?' He ~ said: 'No, I am only
interceding for him.' She said: 'I am not in need of him.' The
Prophet said to 'Abbas: 'O 'Abbas! Are you not astonished
by the love of Mughith for Barira, and the hatred of Barira
for Mughith?'"3
The Prophet ~ used to equally divide his time with his
wives, and used to say: "O Allah! this is my division, for
what I own, so do not blame me for what I do not own." (i.e.
love). For Allah ~ said: (You will never do perfect justice

which is regarding love and sexual intercourse.
A person who is in love should show patience and restraint,
and should prefer to show love, fear and pleasure for Allah
~ ; thus he/she would come under the category of those
about whom Allah ~ said:

( But As for him who feared standing before his Lord,
and restrained himself from impure evil desires and
lusts, verily Paradise will be his abode.) 2
( But for him who fears the standing before his Lord,
there will be two gardens.) 3
We ask Allah ~ ' the Lord of the Supreme Throne, to make
us among those who prefer their love for Allah to that of
their own desires, and seek therewith to attain His Pleasure,
Alone.
