IBNTAYMIYYAH

May Allah have mercy upon him

He is Al:unad bin 1Abdu-l-Ba1Im bin <Abdu-s-Salam bin
<Abdullah bin Abu Qasin:i ibn Taymiyyah al-ljarrarii Taqi ad-Din
Abu al- <Abbas bin Shihab ad-Din. He was bontin Barran, an old
city within the Arabian Peninsula between Syria1 and Iraq, on
the tenth or the twelfth of the month Rabtu-1-Awwa/ in the year
661H. He and his family were later forced to flee to Damascus
due to the occupation by the Tartars.
He came &om a family of scholars, his father and grandfather
were both scholars as were three of his brothers: iAbdu-rRal}man, <Abdullah artd his half-brother, Mul)ammad.
During his early studies of Islam, he never ceased to amaze
his teachers at the strength of his memory, keen irtteUigence
and depth of understanding. It is said that he was first allowed
to give legal verdicts at the age of nineteen and he began teaching at Dar al-Jjadith a5-Sttkrjyyah at the age of twertty-two.
He became famous for his knowledge of l)adith, indeed he
1

13

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

was a lfdfiz (l:Iadith Master), and for his knowledge of the Quean
and its related sciences, he impressed all with his circles on tafsir.
He also attained expertise in Usu/ al-Fiqh and Fiqh, knowledge
of the differences of opinions present amongst the scholars,
writing, mathematics, history, astronomy and medicine. Many
of the scholars of his time testified that he had attained the
rank of Mujtahid.
He always showed a great concern for the affairs and welfare
of the Muslims and this manifested itself greatly in his efforts
during the Jihad against the Tartars, Christians and Rawtifttfah
wherein his displays of bravery, courage and inspiring talks were
one of the most important factors in the Muslims victory against
their enemies. These efforts won the praise and admiration of
many scholars and indeed the ensuing generations of Muslims
to this very day.
Aside from the physical Jihad, ibn Taymiyyah launched an intellectual struggle against the various deviant sects and heretical ideas of his day. He refuted the SHa, the People of Theological Rhetoric (Ahl al-Ka/dm) - such as thejahm!Jyah, Mu'tazilah
and many of Ashti'irah, the philosophers who promoted the
school of the early Greeks (jaltisifa), the majority of $Uji sects
and paths and the adherents of other religions. His criticisms
were not based on a lack of understanding, rather he first gained
an in~depth knowledge of each of these schools and as such his
critique of them was systell)atic, acute and valid. For example it
is said that his refutation of Greek philosophy was one of the
most devastating attacks ever leveled against them. His refutation of Christianity was outstanding and his rebuttal of the Sh/a
completely demolished their beliefs and innovations from root
to branch. 2
1

When this is understood, the critique levelled against him by some that 'his
learning exceeded his intellect' can safely be relegated to the trash bin.

14

lbn Taymfyyah

Needless to say; these refutations, and his very direct methods of refuting, made him many enemies and as a result his life
was full of trials and persecutions. His enemies were careful to
look for anything by which they could attack him and they eventually found what they were looking for in his works of belief
entitled 'Aqidah al-Wcisifjyyah and 'Aqidah al-flamawjyyah. Due to
their total misunderstanding of what he wrote, they accused
him of anthropomorphism and had him .imprisoned on more
than one occasion. Ibn Kathir mentions that some scholars sat
with ibn 'Taymiyyah to debate with him concerning his ~qidah
al-Wtiszf!yyah and the debate ending with their agreeing with him
in what he had written. 3 Similarly ibn Kathir mentions that some
scholars debated with him concerning 'Aqidahal-lfamawiyyahand
his replies to their accusations could not be rebutted. 4 lbn
Taymiyyah was agairt imprisoned because of a legal ruling he
gave concernirtg divorce, and yet again he was later imprisoned
for a legal verdict he issued prohibiting making journeys for the
purpose of visiting graves. It was during this imprisonment that
he passed away.
With regards his personality artd worship, he exerted a huge
artd lasting influence on all who met hirn and he was known for
his worship and glorification of the Islamic laws, both inwardly
and outwardly. His complete reliance upon Allah can be best
surntned up in what his student, ibrt al-Qayyim, relates from
him when he was told that his enemies had plotted to kill hirn
or imprison him,
If they kill me it will be martyrdom for me. If they

expel tne, it will be migration for me; if they expel
me to Cyprus, I will call its people to Allah so that
they answer me. If they imprison me, it will be a
place of worship for me.:.

Ibn al-Qayyim himself said,
Allah knows, I have never seen anyone who had a
better life than his. Despite the difficulties and all
that expunges comfort and luxury, nay, things completely opposite to them; despite imprisonment, intimidation and oppression, ibn Taymiyyah had a
purer life than anyone could. He was the most generous, the strongest of heart and the most joyful of
souls, with the radiance of bliss in his face. When
we were seized with fear and our thoughts turned
negative, and the earth grew narrow for us, we would
go to him. No sooner did we look at him and hear
his words, all these feelings would leave us to be
replaced by relief, strength, certainty and tranquillity.('

Al-Bazzar said,
I was of those who knew well his habits, he would
not talk to anyone unnecessarily after the prayer of
Fajr and would remain performing the dhikrof Allah
in a low voice which perhaps could just be heard by
one sitting next to him; and frequently would he
direct his gaze to the sky. This he would do until the
Sun had risen high and the time in which it is pro-

hibited to pray was ove~. 7

He also said,
I have not seen him mention arty of the pleasures
and attractions of this world, he did not delve into
worldly conversations and he never asked for any
of its livelihood. Instead he directed his attentions
and conversations to seeking the Hereafter and what
could get him closer to Allah. 8

Once, the ruler Mul:iammad bin Qalawiin accused him of wanting to wrench kingship from him due to his large following to
which he replied,
I wquld do that! By Allah, your kingship and the
kingship of Moghul is not even worth two meagre
coins in my eyes!')

His Teachers 10

The Praise of the Scholars for him
Many scholars praised ibn Taymiyyah, not only for his scholady achievements but also for his active participation in Jihad
and the affairs relating to public welfare, his abundant concern
for others and his worship. Below is a selection of some of
these statements:
1. Al-1-fdftz adh-DhahabI said,
It was amazing when he mentioned an issue over
which there was a difference of opinion and when
he gave evidente and decided the strongest opinion
- he could perform ijtihad due to his fulfilling its conditions. I have not seen one who was quicker than
he at recalling a verse which pertained to the issue
that he derived from it, nor a man who was stronger
in recalling texts and referring them to their sources.
The Sunnah was in front of his eyes and upon the tip
of his tongue with eloquent phrases and an open
eye.

He was a sign from the signs of Allah in tafsir and
expounding upon it. With regards to the foundation of the religion and knowledge of the differing
opinions [on an issue], he was unequalled- this along-

19

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

side his generosity, courage and lack of attention to
the joys of the soul.
Quite possibly his legal rulings in the various sciences
reached three hundred volumes, indeed more and
he was always saying the truth for the sake of Allah,
not caring for the blame that came to him.
Whosoever associates with him and knows him well
accuses me of falling short with regards td him. Whosoever opposes him and differs with him accuses
me of exaggeration, and I have been wronged by
both parties - his companions and his opponents.
He was white skinned with black hair and a black
beard with a few grey hairs. His hair reached his
earlobes and his eyes were eloquent tongues. He had
broad shoulders and a loud, dear voice with a fast
recitation. He was quick to anger but overcame it
with patience and forbearance.
l have not seen his like for supplications [to Allah],
his seeking succour with Him and his abundant concern for others. However I do not believe him to be
infallible, rather I differ with him on both fundamental and subsidiary matters, for he - despite his
vast learning, extreme courage, fluid mind and re,gard for the sanctity of the religion - was a man
from amongst men. He could be overcome with
sharpness and anger in discussion, and attack his
opponents [verbally] hence planting enmity in their
souls towards him.

If only he were gentle to his opponents then there
would have been a word of agreern~nt over him for indeed their great scholars bowed to his learning, acknowledged his ability, lack of mistakes and

20

lbn Tqymjyyah
conceded that he was an ocean having no limits and
a treasure having no equivalent. ..
He used to preserve the prayers and fasts, glorifying
the laws outwardly and inwardly. He did not give
legal rulings out of poor understanding for he was
extrernely intelligent, nor out of lack of knowledge
for he was art overflowing ocean. Neither did he
play with the religion but derived evidence from the
Qur>an, Sunnah and Qjyds (analogy), he proved (his
stances] and argued following the footsteps of the
Imams who preceded him, so he has a reward if he
erred and two rewards if he was correct.

He fell ill in the castle [wherein he was imprisoned]
with a serious disease until he died on the night of
Monday zoch Dhu-f-Qa'dah, and they prayed over him
in the Magid of Damascus. Afterwards many talked
about the number that attended his funeral prayer,
and the least number given was fifty thousand.D

2. Ibn Ijajr aVAsqalanI said,
The Shaykh of our Shaykhs, ai-Hdfiz Abu al-Yu'mari
[ibn Sayyid an-Na~] said in his biography of ibn
Taymiyyah, 'al-Mizzi encouraged me to express my
opinion on Shaykh ai-lsfdm TaqI ad'"Din. I found him
to be from those who had acquired a fortune of
knowledge in the sciences that he had. He used to
completely memorise and implement the Sunan and
Athdr (narrations). Should he speak about tafsir, he
would carry its flag, and should he pass a legal ruling
in jiqh, he knew its limits. Should he speak about a
l:iadith, he. was the seat of its knowledge and fully

13

lbn I:lajr, [under the biography of ibn Taymiyyah].

21

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR Cl ' RES

cognisant of its narrations. Should he give a lecture
oh religions and sects, none was se(!n who was more
comprehensive or meticulous than he. He surpassed
his contemporaries irt every science, you wou]d not
see one like him and his own eye did not see one
like himself... ' ·14

3. lbn r,Iajr also said,
The acclaim of TaqI ad-Din is more renown then
that of the Sun and titling him Shaykh al-Islam of his
era remains until our time upon the virtuous tongues.
It will continue tomorrow just ~s it was yesterday.
No one refutes this but a person who is ignorant of
his prestige or one who turns away from justice ...
... those of his stances that wet;~ rejected from him
were not said by him due to mere whims and desires and neither did he obstinately and deliberately
persist in them after the evidence was established
against him. Here are his works overflowing with
refutations of those who held t() tajsim (anthropomorphism), yet despite this he is a mah who makes
mistakes and is also correct. So that which he is correct in - and that is the majority - is to benefited
from and Allah's Mercy should be sought for him
due to it, and that wruch he is incorrect in should
not be blindly followed. Indeed he is excused for
his mistakes because he is one of the Imams of his
time and it has been testified that he fulfilled the
conditions of jjtihtid...
From the astonishing qualities of this man was that
he was the severest of people against the People of

14

Jbjd,

22

lbn Taymjyyah
Innovation, the Rawtifief.ah, the l:fulii!iyyah and the
lttiflad!Jyah. His works on this are many and famous
and his fattiwa on them cannot be counted, so how
the eyes of these innovators must have found joy
when they heard those who declared him to be a
ktifin And how delighted they must have been when
they saw those who did not declare him to be a kdfir
in turn being labeled ktiftn It is obligatory upon the
one who has donned the robe of knowledge and
possesses intelligence that he consider the words of
a man based upon his well-known books or from
the tongues of those who are trusted to accurately
convey his words. Then he should isolate from all
of this what is rejected and warn against it with the
intention of giving sincere advice and to praise him
for his excellent qualities and for what he was correct in, as is the way of the scholars.
If there were no virtues of Shtqkh TaqI ad-Din except for his famous student Sh~kh Shams ad-Din
ibn al-Qayyim al-J awziyyah, writer of many works,
from which both his opponents and supporters benefited, then this would be a sufficient indication of
his [ibn Taymiyyah'sJ great position. And how could
it be otherwise when the Shafi'I Imams and others,
not to speak of the f:Ianbalis, of his time testified to
his prominence in the [Islamic] sciences... 15

4. Ibn Kath.Ir said,
The least he would do when he heard something
was to memorise it and then busy himself with learning it. He was intelligent and had much committed
to memory, he became an Imam in ta/sir and every15

From Ibn l:fajr's endorsement of Radd al-W74ftrcontained at the end of the
book.

t:hing linked to it and knowledgeable in.ftqh. Indeed
it was said that he was more knowledgeable of the
.ftqh of the madhhabs than the followers of those very
same madhhabs in his time and other than his time.
He was a scholar in Usul and the branches of the
religion, in grammar, the language and other textual
and intellectual sciences .... no scholar of a science
would speak to him except that he thought that that
science was the specialty of ibn Taymiyyah. As for
}:iadith then he was the carrier of its flag, a ljci.ft~
able to distinguish the weak from the strong, fully
acquainted with the narrators... .'6

He also said,
He was, may Allah have mercy upon him, from the
greatest of scholars but also from those who err
and are correct. However his errors with respect to
his correct rulings were like a drop in a huge ocean
and they are forgiven him as is authentically reported
by Bukhari,

When a ruler makes a ruling) and he is correct then he has
two rewards, and if he has e"ed then he has one reward.
5.

Al-Eftifiz al-MizzI said,
I have not seen the likes of him and his own eye
had not seen the likes of himself. I have not seen
one who was more knowledgeable than he of the
Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger, nor one
who followed them more closely. 1'

6. Al-lfa]iz 'Abdur-Ral:iman ibn Rajab al-HanbalI said,
He is the lmdm, the legal Jurist, the Mujtahid, the
Scholar of ljadith, the lf4fi~, the Explainer of the
Qur'an, the Ascetic, Taq:t ad-D:tn Abu aVAbbas
Shaykh al-Islam, the most knowledgeable of the
knowledgeable. It is not possible to exaggerate his
renowri when he is mentioned and his fame does
not require us to write a lengthy tract on him. He,
may Allah have mercy upon him, was unique in his
time with respect to understanding the Qur'an and
knowledge of the realities of faith .... 18

His Sayings
Shaykh al-Islam was famous for stating profound statements,
below is a selection of some of them.
• Every punishment from Hirn is pure justice and every
blessing from Him is pure gr:ace. 19
• Whoever desires everlasting bliss, let him adhere firmly
to the threshold of servitude 20
• The Lord loves to be loved. 21
• Guidance is not attained except with knowledge and cor-

rect direction is not attained except with patience. 22
• In this world there is a paradise, whoever does not enter

it will not enter the Paradise of the Hereafter. 23
• The one who is [truly] imprisoned is the one whose heart
is imprisoned from Allah and the captivated one is the
one whose desires have enslaved hirn. 24
• This whole. religion revolves around knowing the truth
and acting by it, and action must be accompanied by patience. 25
Ill!

Worship is founded upon the Legal Law and following it,
not upon ones base desires and innovation. 26

• If you do not taste the sweetness of an action in your
heart, suspect it, for the Lord, Exalted is He, is the Appreciative. 27
• The more the servant loves his Master, the less will he
love other objects and they will decrease in number~ The
less the servant loves his Master, the more will he love

other objects and they will increase in number. 28
• Perpetually is the servant either the recipient of a bless·
ing from Allah; in which case he is need of gratitude; or
he is the perpetrator of a sin, in which case he is in need
of repentance; he is always moving from one blessing to
another and is always in need of repentance. 29
• Sins cause harm and repentance removes the cause. 30
• Bearing witness to taw(Jidopens the door of good and repentance from sins doses the door of evil. 31
• The jihad against the soul is the foundation for the Jihad
against the disbelievers and hypocrites. 32
• A man will never fear something besides Allah unless it
be due to a disease in his heart. 33
• Trials and tribulation are like feeling the heat and cold,
when one knows that they cannot be avoided, he will not
feel anger at their onset, nor will he be distressed or disheartened. 34

• The perfection of taw(;id is found when there remains nothing in the heart except Allah, the servant is left loving
those He loves and what He loves, hating those He hates
and what He hates, showing allegiance to those He has
allegiance to, showing enmity to those He shows enmity
towards, ordering what He orders and· prohibiting what
He prohibits. 35

• In this world, man finds in the remembrance of Allah,
praising Him and worshipping Him, a delight that is incomparable to anything else. 36
• The objective of asceticism is to leave all that harms the
servants Hereafter and the objective of worship is to do
all that will benefit his Hereafter. 37
• Sins are like chains and locks preventing their perpetrator
from roaming the vast garden of tawpid and reaping the
fruits of righteous actions. 38
• What can my enemies do to me? I have in my breast both
my heaven and my garden. If I travel they are with me,
never leaving me. Imprisonment for me is a chance to be
alone with my Lord. To be killed is martyrdom and to be
exiled from my land is a spiritual journey. 39

His Death
Ibn 1'aymiyyah died while imprisoned on the twentieth of
Dhid-:Qa'dah of the year 728H, after ultimately being banned
from reading or writing. He fell sick for the few days preceding
his death.
His funeral was attended by a huge congregation despite the
many lies and slanders being spread about him by certain innovators of his time. Al-Bazzar says,

Once the people had heard of his death, not a single person in Damascus who was able tD attend the
prayer and wanted to remained except that he appeared and was present for it. As a result~ the markets in Damascus were closed and all transactions
of livelihood were stopped... Governors, heads,
scholars, jurists all came out. They say that none of
the majority of the people failed t0 tutti up - according to my knowledge - except three individuals;
they were well known for their enmity for ibn
Taymiyyah and thus, hid away from the people out
of fear for their lives.40
Ibn Kathir said,
There were so many people in front of his funeral,
behind it, to its right and to its left. None but Allah
could enumerate them, and then someone shouted,
'this is how the funerals of the 1mcims of the Sunnah
ate to be!' At that the people started to tty... when
the call to prayer for ?uhrwas proclaimed they prayed
after it straight away against the usual norm. Once

Foreword

All praise is due to Allah, peace and blessings be upon the
Last Prophet

Know 0 beloved reader that it is most important to spend
one's time and energy in treating the heart, and hastening to
correct and purify it from sickness and all sins. This is due to
the heart occupying a great and lofty position in Islam, for it is
the place to which the Lord looks and the storehouse for lawflid,
faith, and sincerity.
Actions are distinguished, one from the other, with respect to
their excellence in the Sight of Allah in accordance with the
condition of the heart, not by their number or form, but rather
due to the strength of the caller, his or her truthfulness, his or
her sincerity and the extent to which he or she prefers Allah
over himself or herself. 1
The heart forms the foundation, it is the owner of the limbs,
and the limbs are its soldiers, so when the owner becomes purified its soldiers become purified, and when the owner becomes

sullied thert its soldiers become sullied.
Al-Hafic;lh ibn Bajr ai-<Asqalaru, may Allah have mercy upon
him and nourish us with his knowledge, said: 'The heart has
been singled out for this because it is the leader of the body,
and through the purification of the leader the subjects become
purified, and with his corruption they become corrupted. So if
you, 0 servant of Allah, wish to cure your heart then it is upon
you to be truthful with regards to seeking refuge with Allah and
putting your trust in Him, to pray a great deal of superogatory
prayers, to perform the actions of obedience to Allah frequently,
to pray the night prayer while the people are sleeping, and to
treat your heart by making it continuously stick to the
remembrances and by befriending only the righteous ... and to
freguerttly recite the Qur'an. May Allah allow all of this to be
preserved by him.'
So my brother Muslim, this is a treatise by Shaykhul-Islam
lbn Tayrniyyah concerning the topic, 'Diseases of the Hearts and
their Cures.' I found it amongst his, 'Fatawa' and saw it to be a
beautiful work, containing many benefits. So it is upon you 0
Muslim to hurry to distribute this amongst your beloved friends
and your brothers so that perchance Allah may correct their hearts
and Allah's aid is sought.

COMPILER'S INTRODUCTION

The Keys to the Life of the Heart

Ibn ul~Qayyim, may Allah have mercy upon him; said:
The keys to the life of the heart lie in .reflecting upon
the Qur'an, being humble before Allah in secret, and
leaving sins. 1

Allah, the Most High, said:

A Book which We have sent down to you, full
of blessings that they may ponder over its
verses, and that men of under.s tanding may take
heed.

[Surah $dd (38) : 29]

So Allah informed us that He sent down this Great Quean,
blessed in its wording, meaning, commands, prohibitions and
regulations. Amongst its blessings is that the one who recites
'lftid!Jyuf-AniJd(J ila Biltidil-Afrdfl [p. 45J of Ibn ul-Qayyim.

even one wotd of it then he has a reward, and this _reward is
increased tenfold, as mentioned in the padith reported by atTirmidhi, and at-Tirmidhl said that it is pasan fapip. 2 Also amongst
its blessings is that the one who reads it and acts upon it shall
not be misguided ih this world, nor fall into distress and misery
in the Hereafter as stated by Ibn <Abbas (racj,jyAl/ahu 'anhtl) in
the commentary to the verse,

...whoever follows My guidance shall neither go
astray nor fall into distress and misery.
[SJ/rah Ta Ha (20) :123]
Amongst its blessings is that the one who learns it and teaches
it is from the best ofpeople as occurs in the padith reported by
al-Bukhari,
The best of you is. the orte who learns the Qur'an
and then teaches it. 3
Amongst its blessings is that it will be an intercessor on the

He, the Exalted informed us that He revealed the Qur'an so
that its meanings, commands and prohibitions may be reflected
over, such that if one were to come across a verse commanding
something then he should follow it. If one were to come across
a verse forbidding something then he should leave it.
If one were to come across a verse concerning the Mercy of
Allah then he would hope for this Mercy and ask for it. If one
were to come across a verse threatening with punishment then
he would fear this and seek refuge with Allah from it. If one
were to come across a verse concerning the glorification of Allah
then he would glorify Allah, artd through this faith, knowledge,
guidance and taqwci will increase. Allah said while describing the
believers,

See also the chapter, 'The Excellence of Reciting the Qur'an' in Rjydrj a.f-)iilihin.
Referring to the padith <)f Abu Umamah (rad[y.A/iahu 'anhu), that he heard the
Messenger of Allah (;i) say: 'Recite the Qur'an, for on the Day of Resurrection
it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones,
al-Baqarah andAl-'lmrdn, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two
clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who
tecite thetn. Recite Sutah al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to
give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.'

And the badith of an-N awwas (rarjryA//ahu 'anhu), that he heard the Messenger of Allah (~ saying: 'On the Day of Resurrection the Qur'an and those
who acted according to it will be brought with Siirah ai-Baqarah and .41-'lmrcin
preceding them.' The Messenger of Allah (jli) likened them to three things,
which I did not forget afterwards. 'Two clouds or two black canopies with
light between them,. or like two flocks of birds in tanks pleading for one wh<)
recited them.' Sal:lli:i Muslim [Eng. Trans. 2/ 385-386 no. 1757, 1759] [Translator\

The Keys to the Life of the Heart

And when His verses are recited unto them, they
increase th<!ir faith.
[Surah Anja! (8) : 2]

hope and fear; and Allah, the Most High, said,

Do they not ponder ov<!r the Qur' an or are there
locks upon their hearts?
[Surah Mu/;Jammad (47): 24]

Amongst the ways of giving life to the heart is to be humble
to Allah in secret. Meaning to desire and long for Allah through
supplication, seeking forgiveness, turning to Him, asking for
victory, Paradise and shelter from Hellfire at the time when Allah
descends to the lowest Heaven in the last third of the night, as
occurs in the authentic }:tadith,
Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven when a
third of the night remains, saying: Who is supplicating to Me that I may answer him? Who is asking of
Me that I may give him? Who is seeking forgiveness
of Me that I may forgive him? 5

This flddith contains encouragement to stand in the last part of
the night, praying, supplicating, and asking for forgiveness, Paradise and safety from the Fire, and supplicating for good in this
life and the Hereafter. Indeed Allah has commanded us with
supplication and promised to reply, and He who is far removed
from imperfection, does not break His promises. Amongst the

times that this reply will be attained is the last part of the night~
and this is a blessing that Allah bestows upon whomsoever He
wishes, and Allah is the Possessor of great blessings and bounty.
And from the ways of giving life to the heart is to leave the sins
that kill it, as in the l).adith,
When the servant performs a sin a black spot ap~
pears on his heart, and if he seeks forgiveness this
black spot is removed, and if he returns to sin the
black spot grows until his heart becomes black, and
this is the 'ran' about which Allah spoke,

The Ailments of the Hearts and their
Cures

The hearts are three types:
(i) The correct heart that is secure from all desires that oppose the command of Allah and His prohibitions, and it is secure form all doubts that contradict what He informs. Just as it
is secure from worshipping anything else besides Allah and from
seeking judgement from any person other than His Messenger.

(ii) The dead heart, this being the opposite of the correct
heart containing no life, neither knowing its Lord nor worshipping Him.

(iii) The heart that has some life but also has a defect. So it
contains love of Allah, faith in Him, sincerity and trust towards
Him from those things that are essential to it remaining alive. It
also contains the love of vain desires and preference for them,
despicable morals and manners from those things that cause it
to die, and it is continously wavering between these two conditions.
So the first type of heart is the living, humble, soft and gentle
heart. The second is the dry, harsh and dead heart. The third is
the heart which is diseased, it can either be made secure or have

41

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

its destruction sealed.
All of the diseases of the heart are founded upon desires and
doubts. The life of the heart and its illumination is the cause of
all good to be found in it and its death and darkness is the cause
of all evil to be found in it.
The heart can never be alive and correct except through
cognisance of the truth, loving it and preferring it to everything
else. There can never be any happiness, joy or correction for it,
unless it makes its sole object of worship and desire Allah
alone.
This can never be perfected except through purification of
heart, repentance, and its relinquishing itself from all types of
false love and despicable manners. This can never be attained
except through striving hard against one's soul that incites towards evil, and bringing it to account and combating the satans
from among the jinn by holding fast to Allah; knowing their
plots and objectives, and safeguarding oneself from them through
remembrance of Allah, the Exalted, and .seeking refuge with
Him from them. 1
The heart becoming defective and weak revolves around two
basic matters: the corruption of knowledge and the corruption
of intent. These in turn lead to two destructive illnesses - anger
and misguidance. Misguidance being the end result of the corruption of intent. So these two diseases are the lords of all the
ailments that afflict the heart. Its cure lies in guidance based on
knowledge. Guidance based on knowledge is to know the truth
and to follow it. The whole of the Qur'an is a cure for these two

Concerning the Ailments of the Hearts
and their Cures

Indeed all praise is due to Allah, we seek His help, and we
seek His forgiveness, and we seek refuge in Allah from the evil
of our sows and the evil of our actions. Whomsoever Allah
guides, none can misguide, and whomsoever Allah misguides,
none can guide. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of
worship except for Allah, the One Who has no partner, and I
bear witness that Mu}:iam.mad is His servant and Messenger.

[Surah af-lsrd' (17) : 82_1

... and heal the breast of a believing people and
removes the anger of their hearts ...
[Sitrah Ta1vbah (9) : 14-15)

The disease of the body is the opposite of its being sound
and in good health, it is a degeneration that occurs in it causing
a failure of the natural senses of perception and movement. So
with respect to its perception either it goes completely such as
blindness or deafness, or it perceives objects incorrectly - such
as its perceiving something sweet to be bitter or its hallucinating things that have no reality in the real world. With respect to
the failure of its movements then examples of this would be
the inability to digest food, or the body's aversion to nourishment that it is need of, or its desire of things that would weaken
it, leading to illnesses as a result of these but not leading to
death or physical ruin.
Instead these failures would lead to suffering of the actual
body either as a result of consuming a wrong quantity of some-

48

Concerning the Ailments ef the Hearts and their Cures
thing or applying something to the body in the wrong way. As
for the first, then it could be consuming too little a quahtity of
nourishment and therefore the body would reqillre more, ot it
could be by consutnirtg too much and therefore the body ,.vould
require it to be removed. As for the second_, then it could be
like extremely high or low temperatures due to incorrect usage
of medidrte.
The same is true for the d.isea_se of the heart for it is a type of
degeneration that occurs in it, causing failure in its perception
and desires. So with respect to its perception then this is degenerated by its being presented With doubts upon doubts until it
cannot see the truth or it perceives the truth incorrectly. Its
desires are degenerated by its hating the truth which would be
of benefit to it, and loving the falsehood that would cause it
harm. So this is why 'diseases" has sometimes been explained to
be doubt and suspicion, as w~s explained by Mujahid and Qata.dah
in their tomrrtentaries to the verse;

In their hearts is a disease and Allah ha_s increased
their cUsease.
[Surah alBaqarah (2) : 10]
and at other times to be the desire to commit fornication as in
the case of the verse;

.•. Lest he _in whose heart is a disease be moved
with desire.
[-Surah al-Abzab (33) ; 321

49

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

This is why al-Khara'ip authored a book called, 'The book of
the W'Cakness of the Hearts Meaning their Diseases,' meaning by
'diseases' here - the diseases of desire.
The sick person is harmed by things that the healthy person is
not, so slight heat, cold, exertion or other such things will harm
him due to his inability to endure them in his weakened state.
Sickness, in general, weakens the one afflicted by making his
endurance weak and unable to sustain what he would have been
able to sustain in a strong state. So a healthy state is preserved
by remaining healthy and is removed by the opposite, and the
sickness is made mote severe by the presence of conditions
similar to those that led to the sickness in the first place and
removed by the opposite. Therefore, if a sick person is afflicted
by something similar to that which led him to being sick in the
first place, then he increases in illness and his endurance becomes weaker, until maybe he dies. But if he is affected by
something that will increase his strength and weaken the illness
then the opposite will occur.
The disease of the heart is a pain that occurs in the heart such
as the anger felt towards an opponent who overcomes you, for
this hurts the heart.
Allah, the Exalted said,

Concerning the Ailments of the _Hearts and their Cures
So the healing for them was by removing the suffering that
had occurred in their hearts, and it is said: 'So and so has healed
his anger.' In the case of retaliation it is said: 'The close relatives of the killed sought healing/ meaning healing of their grief,
anger and sorrow - all of these being sufferings that occur in
oneself. Likewise doubt and ignorance cause pain to the heart.
The Prophet (~ said,
Could they not have asked if they did not know?
Indeed the cure for ignorance is to ask. 1

And the one who has doubt in something he has taken on
board, causes harm to his heart until he attains knowledge and
certainty. Hence it is said to a scholar when he answers in a way
that clarifies the truth: 'you have healed me with the answer,'

The full text of the badithis narrated byjabir bin Abdullah that he said,'' We
went on a journey arid a man from amongst us was injured in the head by a
stone. After this he had a wet dream. He asked his Companions, 'Do you find
that I have a concession for performing ftryammum?' They said, 'We do not find
any concession, for you are capable ofrmploying water (for purification).' So he
bathed and as a result died. When we returned to the Prophet (~ he was
informed of this upon which he said, 'They have killed him, may Allah kill
them! Could they not have asked if they did not know? Indeed the cure of
ignorance is to ask! It was sufficient for him to perform tqyammum, sprinkle
some water on the wourtd or put a bandage on his wound .and then wipe over
it, and w~sh the remainde.r of his body.'"

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

[1.1 Between Sickness and Death]
Sickness is of a lesser level then death, so the heart dies due
to total ignorance but becomes ill due tb having fragments of
ignorance, and in this case there can be either death, sickness or
healing for the heart. Its life, death, sickness and the cure is
greater and more vital then the life, death, sickness and cure of
the body. This is why the heart becomes sick when presented
with doubts and desires, or the sickness becomes more acute.
If wisdom and goodly exhortation occur then theses are routes
to its correction and cure.
Allah, the Most High; says,

That He may make what is thrown in by Satan
a trial for those hearts is a disease and whose
hearts are hardened.
[Surah aL-ljajj (22) : 53]

Because this breeds doubts irt them and their hearts harden
due to their dryness, and are weakened by doubt and become
distant from faith and therefore what is thrown in by Satan becomes a trial for them.
Allah, the Most High, said,

52

[1.1 Between Sickness and Death]

If the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is ~
disease, and those who spread false news among
the people of Madinah cease not, We shall certainly let you overpower them, then they will
not be able to stay in it as your neighbouts but
for a little while.
[Surah al-Af;zab (33) : 60)

... and that no doubts may be left for the People
of the Book and the believers, and that those in
whose hearts is a disease and the disbelievers
may say, 'What does Allah intend by this parable?'
[Surah al-Muddaththir (74): 31]

These people's heart (which have hardened) have not died as
in the case of the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and neither
are their hearts correct and pure like the pure hearts of the believers, rather they contains the sickness of doubt and desire.
The same applies to (the ones referred to in) His saying:

... Lest he in who!;te heart is a disease be moved
with desire ...
[Surah al-Apzftb (33) : 32]

53

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

Referring to the sickness of desire, for indeed if the correct
heart is tempted by a woman it will not incline towards her,
contrary to the heart diseased with .desire, for it, due to its weakness, will incline towards what it is tempted with in accordance
to the strength or the weakness of the sickness, and when it
submits to the temptation, the sickness in the heart is satiated.

[1.2 The Qur>an is a cure for the hearts]
The Qur>an is a cure for that which is within the heart, and for
the one who has the sickness of doubt and desire in his heart,
for it contains clear proofs that distinguish the truth from falsehood, and remove the sickness of false doubts to leave certain
knowledge, correct perception and understanding such that the
heart sees things in accordance to their reality. It contains wisdom, goodly exhortations both encouraging good and deterring
from evil, and stories which contain lessons that necessarily lead
to the correction of the heart by making the heart desire what is
good for it and detest what is harmful to it. Hence the heart is
left desiring that which will guide it~ hating that which will deviate it after it used to desire that which would deviate it and
hate that which would guide it.
The Qur>an removes all the sicknesses that invoke false desires until the heart becomes pure and therefore its desires become pure and it returns to the natural state (fitrah) that it was
created in, just as the body returns to the natural state upon
being treated. The heart will be nurtured with faith and the
Quean such that it will become strong- for indeed the pudfica~
tion of the heart is like the growing of the body.

54

[1.2 The Qur'dn is a cure far the hearts)

[1.3 Righteous Actions are a Cure for the
Heart]
Zaktih (purification) in the language means: growth and increase
in correction, it is said, 'something has zakah', when it has grown
in correction. The heart is in need of being nurtured so that it
may mature and increase until it becomes complete and correct
just as the body is in need of nourishment that is good for it,
but along with this there is a need to prevent anything from
harming it. So the body will not grow until it gains that which
will benefit it and is prevented from that which will harm it,
likewise the heart will not become pure such that it may grow
and become complete with respect to its correction, until it
attains that which benefits it and represses that which harms it just as the flower will not grow without these rwo factors.

$adaqah (charity), due to its extinguishing the sins as water
extinguishes fire, causes the heart to be purified. Its zakdh means
something additional to it being merely free of sins.

[1.4 Leaving Indecent Actions are a Cure for the
Heart]
Similarly abstaining from indecent actions and sins leads to
purification of the heart, for these are of the same level as leprosy of the body or thorns on a flower. So when the body is
freed of this leprosy by releasing the additional blood for example, the natural strength of the body emerges and it can find
relief and thereby grow. Likewise when one seeks repentance
from sin, the heart is released from contamination - whereby it
mixed the righteous actions with evils actions, so when one
repents from sins the strength of the heart emerges as does its
desire to perform righteous actions and it finds relief from these
false and corruptmatters that it was submerged in.
So the zakdh of the heart means its growing and becoming
complete. Allah the Exalted said,

[1.5 The Effect of Sins Upon the Purity of the
Heart]
~dl (fairness and justice) is Ftiddl (balance), and in balance lies

the correction of the heart, just as in zulm (imbalance/ oppression) lies its corruption. This is why for every sin that the person has committed he has oppressed his self (zaliman Ii nafsiht).
The opposite of zulm is 4dl, so this sinful person has not been
just to his selfrather he has oppressed it. The correction of the
heart lies in cad/ and its corruption lies in zulm. Therefore, when
the servant oppresses himself he is the oppressor and oppressed
at the same time, likewise when he is just then he is the one
who is just and the one upon whom the justice is carried out.
The person does an action and he will receive the fruit of this
action, be it bitter or sweet.

[Surah al-Muddaththir (J 4) : 38]

But remind (them) of it (the Qur>an) lest a
person be given up to destruction (tuhsala) for
that which he has earned, when he will find for
himself no protector or intercessor beside.s
Allah. And even if he offers every ransom, it
will not be accepted from him. Such are they
who are given up to destruction because of that
which they earned.

[Surah al-An'tim (6): 70]

Tubsala means: to·repress, to fetter and captivate.
Similarly when the body has recovered from illness it is said:
'He has balanced his temperament and disposition.' This is
because the sickness distorts the temperament, despite the fact
that there is no way to achieve complete balance, safe from mixing
both justice and injustice - but the ideal or close to the ideal
should be aimed for.
The same case applies to the heart, its health and correction
lies in balance, and its sickness lies in deviation, oppression and
digression. But complete balance in everything is impossible, in
action or knowledge - but the ideal or the closest to the ideal
'.should be aimed for. This is why it is said, describing the Sa/aft
way: 'the ideal way.'

Al)mad bin I:!anbal said to one of the people, 'If you were

have of men is due to a sickness from within you, such as the
sickness of shirk and sins.

Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth.
The parable of His Light is as (if there were) a
rtiche and within it a lamp, the lamp is in the
glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from
a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east or
west, whose oil would almost glow forth (of
itself), though no tire touched it. Light upon
Light!
[Surah a1r-Nur(24) : 35]

This is the similitude for the light of faith in the hearts of the
believers. Then He said,

As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are like
a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one thinks it to
be water,. until he comes up to it, he finds it to

[1.6 Ijpes of ?ulm]
be nothing, but He finds Allaah with him, Who
will pay his due (in Hell). And Allah is Swift in
taking account. Or (the state of the disbeliever)
is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, ovet• whelmed with a great wave, topped by dark
clouds - darkness one above another - if a man
stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And
he.for whom Allah has not appointed light, there
is no light.
[Surc;h an-Nitr (24) : 39~40]

So the first verse (no. 39) sets forth a similitude for the false
beliefs and the actions that arise from these beliefs, Orte tortsiders them to be something of benefit, but when they come to
him (on the day of Judgement) he will not find any benefit in
them at all. Rather Allah will fully give him his recompense for
these actions (in Hell). The second verse (no. 40) is the similitude propounded for extensive ignorance, Jack of faith and (correct) knowledge. The person who possesses these is in
darknesses one above another, unable to see anything, for indeed the sight occurs on_ly with the light of faith and (correct)
knowledge,
Allah, the Most High, said,

Indeed, those who a.re pious, wben an evil
thought comes to them from Satan~ they remember (Allah), and they then see (aright).

Allah, the Exalted said,

is darkness, thunder and lightening. They thrust
their fingers in their ears to keep out the stunning thunderclap for fear of death. But Allah

parable of water in which the water is sent down containing
darkness, thunder and lightening - this is not the place for a

Rab[: means the rain that descends from the sky and nourishes the plants. The Arabs call the season in which the rain first
descends al-Rahr due to the fall of rain which causes growth
(of produce). The non-Arabs call the season that follow winter
al-Rabt because in this season the plants from which fruit is
produced blossom ~nd the leaves on the trees appear.

hears nothing but calls and cries.

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

Likening them to the cattle, at whom the shepherd shouts,
and they hear nothing except the cry (not understanding what is
said), as He said in other verses,

~;~~lG)~_;tG;.:·~;:~~·~ . /;;?

0¥t:i~J~:~V?
Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are only like cattle ... nay, they
are even farther astray from the Path.
[Surah al-Furqan (25) : 44]

And indeed We have created many of the jinn
and Mankind for Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not, they have eyes whel'ewith they heat not. They are like cattle - nay
even more astray...
[Surah al~A<rdf (7) : 179]

A group of the commentators, when referring to these verses
and those that resembled them such as the verse,

And when harm touches man, he invokes Us,
lying down on his side, or sitting or standing.
But when We have removed bis harm_from. him,

74

[1.8 The State ef the Dead Heart}
he passes on his way .as if he has never invoked
Us for a harm that touched him!
[Surah Yunus (10) : 12]

Regarding these and other such verses that mention the faults
of man and their condemnation; (the comtnentators) said,
These verses refer to the disbelievers, and that the
meaning of 'man' here is "the disbelievers..'

So the one who hears this explanation is left thinking that one
who openly manifests Islam is not incll,lded in this condemnation and threat, rather his thoughts link (these verses) to those
who openly manifested shirk from amongst the Arabs, or to those
he knows to have openly shown disbelief such as the Jews; the
Christians and the polytheists of Turkey and India - and hence
he would not benefit from these verses that Allah revealed so
that His servants may be guided.
So it is said in reply that firstly: those that openly manifest
Islam include amongst them the believer and hypocrite, and the
hypocrites are. many in all periods of time and they are in the
lowest level of the Hellfire.
Secondly: man possesses a strain of hypocrisy and disbelief
even if he possesses faith along with this, as the Prophet {~
said in the fladith reported by both al.,.Bukhari and Muslim,
There are four qualities which if found in a petSoh
make him a pure hypocrite, and the one who has a
port.ion of them has a portion of hypocrisy until he
leaves them: when he speaks he lies, when he is entrusted., ·h e betrays, when he speaks, he speak a lie,
when he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous,

75

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

when he quarrels, he behaves in a evil and insulting
manner 6

So he informed us that the one who has a portion of these
then he has a portion of hypocrisy, and it is established in the
$abfp of al-Bukhari that he said to Abo Dhar,
Indeed you have displayed a trait offahiliyyah in
you. 7

Arid Abo Dhar was from the most truthful of people with
respect to his faith. He (~ said in the authentic apadith,
Four (traits) in my Ummah are from the matters of
jahiljyyah (pre-lsJamic ignorance): boasting about noble descent, abusing the lineage, wailing [over the
dead] and seeking rain from the stars. 8
You will indeed follow the ways of those that came
before you, inch by inc:h such that if they were to
enter a lizard hole, you too would do so. They asked,

Referring to the fladith reported by al-Ma'riir that, 'At ar-Rabadha I met Abu
Dhar (ratfiyAJltihu <anhu), who was wearing a cloak and likewise bis slave. I asked
about the reason for this. He replied, '1 abused a person by calling his mother
With bad name.' The Prophet(~ .said to me, 'O Abu Dhar! Did you abuse him
by calling his mother with bad names? You have displayed a trait of }dhilryyah.
Your slaves are your brothers and Allah has placed them under your command.
So whoever has a brother under his command should feed him of what he eats
and dress him of what he wears. Do not ask slaves to do things beyond their
.capacity and if you do so, thert help them.' $apif; al-Bukhari[Eng. Trans.1/29

What the early nations took to shall also be taken to

and the Romans.' To which he replied, 'Who else
from amongst the people could it be.' 10

Ibn AbI Mulaykah said,
l met thirty of the Companions of Mul).ammad ('.:i)
all of them fearing hypocrisy for themselves. ·11

And from <All - or Hudhayfah - that he said,
The heart ate of four types: the clear heart that is
illuminated by a torch .~ this is the heart of the be~
Bever. The enc~tsed heart - this is the heart of the
disbeliever, the inverted heart - this is the heart of
the hypocrite, and the heart that has two attractions,
a time when it is called to faith, and a time when it is
called to hypocrisy - these are a people that have
mixed good actions with evil ones.

So when this is understood_, it becomes known that every servant benefits from what All~h mentioned concetning faith; either extolling the branches of faith or censuring the branches
of disbelief.

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CC RES

The case mentioned above is similar to what some of them
ask concerning His saying,

~:~:= ·~J\1~r ~~
Guide us to the Straight Path.
[Surah al~Fatipah (1): 6]

saying: 'Allah has already guided the believer, so what benefit
is there in seeking guidance?' Then some of them reply by saying that the meaning is 'keep us firm upon guidance' as the Arab
would say to the one who is asleep, 'sleep until I come to you.'
Others &om amongst them say that the meaning is, 'keep our
hearts firm upon the guidance' and that the request for firmness
has been omitted. Yet others from amongst them say that it means,
'increase me in guidance.'
This question really occurs due to the absence of their contemplating upon the Straight Path to which the servant seeks
guidance to, for the meaning [of the verse] is [seeking guidance
to] act according to what Allah ordered, and leave what He forbade in all matters.

[1.9 The Need for Beneficial Knowledge]
!his is because the person, even if he has believed that
Mul:iammad is the Messenger of Allah and that the Qur\in is the
truth in a general way, is commonly in need of knowledge of
that which would benefit him and harm him. He is in need of
knowledge concerning what he has been commanded to do and
forbidden from doing in the finer aspects of the matters and in
those areas of which he has no knowledge. [Not only this but
we find that] that which he does have knowledge of, he does
not put the greater part of it to practice! Assuming that all of

78

[ 1; 9 The Need for Beneficial Knowledge)
the commands and prohibitions contained in the Qur'an and
Sunrtah have reached him, then the Qur'an and Sunnah contain
laws that are general and unlversal for which it is not possible to
specify to every individual person " therefore the person has
been cotJHTianded due to the likes of this to ask for guidance to
the Straight Path.
Guidance to the Straight Path includes all of the following
matters: cognizance of what the Messenger (it) came with in
detail, cognizance of what comes under his general orders· and
concern for acting according to ones knowledge, for indeed just
having knowledge is not a cause for attaining guidance if one
does not act according to his knowledge. This is why He said to
His Prophet after the treaty of ljudaybfyyah,

Indeed We have given you a manifest victory~
That Allah may forgive you your sins of the past
and future, complete His Favour upon you, and
guide you on a Straight Path. ·
[Surah Fatb (48): 1 ·~2]

and We gave them the clear Scripture, and

[SJ/rah as-$-djfdt (37): 117-118]

The Muslims have differed as to what Allah Willed from the

79

D l S E A S E S 0 F T H E H E A R T J\ N D T H F. I R C l' R E S

textual matters - matters of knowledge, belief and action while
all of them are agreed that Mu}::iammad is the truth and the Qulan
is the truth. If all of them were to have attained guidance to the
Straight Path in totality then they would never have differed.
Furthermore the majority of those who know what Allah has
ordered disobey Him and do not follow His Way. If they were
guided to the Straight Path in these matters then they certainly
would have performed what they had been commanded to do,
and left what they had been forbidden from. As for those whom
Allah guided from amongst this nation until they became from
the God-Fearing Friends of Allah, then the greatest reason for
this was their supplicating to Allah with this supplication,

0"r-~: ·-'..\\.1~\ t~\
Guide us to the Straight Path.

[Surah al-Fcitipah (l): 61

in every prayer along with the knowledge of their continuous
need of Allah that He guide them on the Straight Path. So due
to their continually saying this supplication and their acknowledging their continuous need of Hirn they became God-Fearing
Friends of Allah.
Sahl bin 1Abdullah at-Tustori said,
There is not route between a servant and Allah closer
to Hirn then need.

The one who has attained guidance in the past is in need of
guidance in the future, this is the real meaning behind the saying of those who say that it means: 'establish us and guide us to
being firm. upon the Straight Path.' The opinion of those who
say that it means: 'increase us in guidance' includes what has

80

/ 1.9 The Need for Beneficial Knowledge)
preceded. But all that has been stated refers to His guidance to
the Straight Path that is to be granted in the future, for indeed
action in the future is upon knowledge that is not yet attained.
And the person is not considered to be one who is guided until
he acts according to his knowledge in the future, but it is possible that this knowledge not be there in the future, rather it could
be removed from the heart, and if it still be there it is also possible that it not be acted upon. Therefore all of mankind is in
dire need of this supplication, this is why Allah made it obligatory upon them in every prayer and they are not in need of any
other supplica.tion as they are of this one. When guidance is
obtained to the Straight Path then help; provision and all of the
happiness that th~ soul seeks are obtained [from Allah]. Allah
knows best.

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

[1.10 The Reality of the Life of the Heart]
Know that the life of the heart and other than it is not merely
one of sensation, movement and intent, or merely one of knowledge and ability as assumed and intent, or merely one of knowledge and ability as assumed by a group of investigators into the
Knowledge of Allah and His power such as Abu al-Husain alBa$r1. They said:
He can only be considered to have Life as long as
He Knows and is Able.

This is rtot the case, rather life is an attribute existing independently in the described, and it is a condition for the existence of knowledge, intent and the ability to perform actions
out of choice. Life is also a necessary outc;ome of these - so
every living thing has understanding, intention, and everything
that has knowledge, intent and performs actions and performs
actions out of choice is alive.
The noun 'modesty' is derived from 'life', so the heart that is
alive - it's owner is also alive - and it contains modesty which
prevents it from performing evil and despicable actions, because
irt the modesty of the heart lies its immunity from these types
of actions. This is why the Prophet (~ said,
Modesty is from faith. 12

and he said,
Modesty and bashfulness are two branches from
amongst the branches of faith, and obscenity and

82

( 1.10 The Reality of the Life of the Heart}
boasting are two bram;:hes from the branches of
hypocrisy. u

This is why the living being is dearly affected by despicable
actions and he has an intent that prevents him from performing
them in contravention to the one who is shameless because he
is not alive and therefore has no modesty and therefore no faith
that would restrain him from evil. So if the heart is alive and
the person dies in its separation from the body, then the death
of the soul lies in its separation from the body not in the fact
that it, in and of itself, has died - w1th the meaning of life leaving it. This is why Allah the Exalted said,

Do not say those who are slain. in the Way of
Allah: 'they are dead', rather they are alive ...
[Surah al-Baqarah (2) : 154]

Think not of those who are slain in the Way of
Allah as dead. Nay they are alive ...
[Surah Al 'lmran (3) : 169]

Despite the fact that they have died are included in His saymgs,

Therefore the death that is affirmed is not the same as the

'The affirmed death is the separation of the soul from the body,

body and soul. This is similar to the fact that sleep is the brother
of death. Allah said,

sleep. He keeps those (souls) for which He ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed.

CHAPTER TWO

Envy is a Sickness of the Heart

Some people said while explaining its meaning:
'Envy (f;asadj is a grievance that befalls one due to
knowledge of the good condition of the wealthy.>

So in accordante with this it is not possible that the person
upon whom the blessings have been bestowed be jealous of
these blessings because this person has them and is accustomed
to them.
A group of people said:
'It is a desire to have the blessings remove.cl from
the one who is envied even if the one who is jealous
does riot attain the likes of these blessings.'

This is different from ghub!a 1 (also meaning envy) because it
1

Chubfa:. envy, referring to the permissible form of envy where the envier wishes
to have the same blessings as the envied but without desiring to see them
removed from the envied. This is opposed to pa.sad, the blameworthy form of
envy where the envier wishes to see the blessings removed from the envied.

87

D 1 S E A S E S 0 F T H E H E A R T A N D T H E I R C L' R E S

refers to a desire to possess the blessings bestowed upon the
one who is envied but without the desire to see them removed
from him.

[2. l The Types of lfasadJ
Strictly speaking, envy (basad) is hatred and disliking the good
condition of the envied one. This of two types:
1) Unrestricted dislike of the blessings bestowed upon the
envied. This is the type of jealousy which incurs blame, so when
one hates something he is then hurt and grieved by the existence of what he hates, and this becomes a sickness irt his heart
such that he takes pleasure in removal of the blessings from the
envied even if this does not result in any benefit to him except
for the single benefit of having the pain that was in his soul
removed. But this pain is not removed except as a result of his
continuously watching the envied so that the · jealous person
finds relief when the blessing is removed, but then it becomes
mote severe as is the case of the one who is sick, for it is possible that this blessing, or one similar to it, returns to the envied.
This is why this second group said:
'It is a desire to have the blessings removed,'

for indeed the one who dislikes the blessings bestowed upon
other than him desires to see them removed.
2) That he dislikes the superiority of that person over him,
and he desires to be like him or better, so this i~ jealousy and
has been called ghubta, and the Prophet (~ tailed it pasad in the
badtth reported by both al-BukharI and Muslim from the padith
of Ibn Mas 1iid and Ibn 1Umar, (rac/!JA!lahu (anhum), that he ~)
said:

88

[2.1 The ljpes of Jfasad]
There is no envy (basad; except in t:Wo cases: a person to whom Allah has granted wisdom, and he
rules by this and teaches it to the people, and a person to whom Allah has granted wealth and property and along with this the power to spend it in the
cause of Truth. 2

This being the wording of Ibn Mas<ud. The wording of Ibn
<Umar, (ratf!JAl!tihu 'anhumri) is,
A person to whom Allah has given the Quean and
he recites it night and day, and a person to whom
Allah has granted wealth and property from which
he gives in charity night and day. 3

Al-Bukhari also reports this (.Jadith from Abu Hurayrah
(rat/fyAlltihu 'anhu) and its wording is,
There is no desirable form of jealousy except for
two types: a person to whom Allah has given the
Quea.n and he recites it day and night, so when a
person hears him he says, 'If only I were given the
likes of what he has been given so that I may act
upon it the way this person is.' And a person to
whom Allah has bestowed weaJth.and he spends in
the cause of Truth, so a person says, 'If only I were
given the likes of what he has beert given, so that I
may act upon it the way this person is.' 4

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

So the Prophet (~ forbade pasad, with the exception of two
cases which are referred to as al-ghubta, meaning that a person
love the condition of someone else and dislike that this person
be superior in this way (without his wishing that it be removed
from that person).
So if it is asked: 'Then why is this called envy when he loves
only that Allah bestows these blessings upon him?' It is said,
'The starting point of this love is his looking towards the favours Allah has bestowed upon someone else and his disliking
that this person be favoured over him. So if this other person
were not present then he would not have desired these blessings. So because the starting point of this love is this dislike
that someone else be made superior to him, then this is called
envy due to the love following the dislike. As for desiring that
Allah bestows favours upon him without consideration of
people's material conditions then this is not envy at all.'
This is why the generality of mankind have been tried with
this second type of envy that has also been called al-muncifasah
(competition) because two people compete in a single desired
matter, both of them trying to attain the same good. The reason
for their trying to attain it is that one of them dislikes that the
other be blessed with this matter over him just as any one of
two competitors dislikes that other beat him.
Competition is not considered blameworthy in general, rather
it is considered to be praiseworthy when competing for righteousness, the Exalted said,

90

[2.1 The ljpes of lfasad}

Indeed the pious will be in delight. On thrones,
looking on . You will recognize in their faces the
brightness of delight. They will be given to drink
pure sealed wine. The last theteof (that wine)
will be the smell of Musk, and for this let those
compete who want to compete.
[Sarah ai-Mutaffifin (83):22-26]

So one is commanded to compete for these delights and not
to compete for the delight of this fleeting world. This is in total
agreement to the padith of the Prophet (;I), for he forbade envy
except of the one who has been granted knowledge artd he ac:ts
according to it and teaches it, artd the one who has been bestowed wealth and spends it (in the way of Allah). As for the
one who has been granted knowledge but does not ac:t upon
this knowledge, or the one who has been bestowed wealth but
does not spend this is obedience to Allah, thert such a persort is
not to be envied and neither is his condition to be hoped for,
for he is not in a state of good that is desirable, rather he is
being presented with punishment. He also allowed jealousy for
the one who has been given a responsibility and he fulfils it
with knowledge and justice, and fulfils the trusts of its owrters,
artd judges amongst the people by the Qur>an and Sunnah.
The station of such a person is lofty but this only comes after
a great amount of effort (Jihad) - the same is true of the mtgahtd.
But the souls do not envy .the one who is in severe hardship and
this is why the Prophet (~ did not mention it even though the

91

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

mujtihid, fighting in the Way of Allah, is superior to the one who
is spending wealth. The opposite is true for the teacher and
spender for they have no enemy in the physical world, but in
the case that there were an enemy that they would have to perform ;ihtid against) then their ranking is more superior (than their
statiort without having an enemy to fight). Similarly the Prophet
(~ did not mention the one who prays, fasts and performs the
pilgrimage, because there is no tangible benefit attained from
the people for these actions by which the person can be exalted
or disgraced, as can be attained in teac;hing and spending.

[2.2 Between ljasad and Ghubta]
Fundamentally, envy occurs when someone else attains power
and authority; otherwise the one who is performing actions is
not normally envied, even if this person be blessed with far
more food, drink and wives than others, as opposed to these
two blessings of power and authority, for they cause a great deal
of envy. This is why you find envy directed at the People of
Knowledge, who have a following amongst the people that you
will not find directed to others who do not have such a follow~
ing. Similarly for the one who attracts a following due to his
spending his wealth, for the people benefit this person by nourishing his heart, and this person brings benefit to them by nourishment of the bodies. Mankind is in need of that which will
correct them in both these matters, this is why Allah, the one
free from imperfection, has propounded two parables,

92

[2.2 Between ljasad and Ghubfa]

Allah puts forward the example: a slave under
the possession of another, he has no power of
any sort, and (the other) a man on whom We
have bestowed a good provision from Us, and
he spends thereof secretly and openly. Could
they be equal? (By no means, not). All the praises
and thanks be to Allah. Nay! (But) most of them
know not. And Allah puts forward another parable of two men, one of them dumb, who has
no power over anything, and he is a burden to
his master, whichever way he directs him he
brings no good. Is such a man equal to one who
commands justice, and is himself on the Straight
Path?
[Surah al-Nap! (16):75-76]

These two parables were propounded by Allah for His Own
Holy Self and for that which is worshipped besides Him, for
indeed the idols are not capable of performing any actions that
would be of benefit, and neither of saying anything that would
be of benefit. So when a completely powerless slave under the
possession of someone is considered, and another to whom Allah
has provided a goodly provision from which he spends in secret

93

D I S E A S E S 0 F T H E H E A R T A N D T HE I R C l' R ES

and in the open, can this slave, incapable of doing good, and
this person capable of doing good for the people in secret and
open, ever be equal? And He, free is as He from defect, is able
to bestow good upon His servants, and as He is continuously
doing so. So how can this incapable slave (i.e. the idol) who
cannot do anything, be likened to Allah to the extent that he is
worshipped alongside Him? So this is the parable ofone to whom
Allah has bestowed wealth from which he spends day and night.
The second parable: when two people are considered, one of
them is dumb, he does not understand nor speak, and is not
capable of anything and is in fact a burden upon his master, for
whichever way he directs him he brings no good and hence he
is of absolutely no use. The other is a just scholar - enjoining
justice and acting justly, and is upon the Straight Path. This person is then like the one upon whom Allah has conferred wisdom and he acts according to it and teaches it. And Allah has
propounded this parable for Himself, for He is All-Knowing,
All-Just, All-Powerful, commanding justice, He is maintaining
His creation is justice is upon the Straight Way as He, the Exalted said,

[Surah Htid (11 ):56]

Tbis is why the people used to exalt the home of al-<Abbas:
<Abdullah used to teach the people and his brother used to feed
them, and so they used to exalt them due to this.
Mu\iwiyah, (ratffy.Allahu canhu), saw the peopleaskingibn <umar
about the rites of Bajj and Ibn 'Umar would give them the verdicts, to which Mu'awiyah said, 'By Allah this is nobility' or
something similar.

[2.3 The Competition between af-.)iddiq
and <umar]
So here is <u mar bin al-Khanab (ratfjyA/lahu <anhu) competing
with Abu Bakr (ratffyAlldhu 'anhu) with respect to spending in
charity as is established in the .)apify (of al-Bukhari) from 'Umar
bin al-Khagab, (ratf!JAllahu 'anhu), that he said:
The Messenger of Allah {~ commanded us to give
in charity, and this coincided with my possessing
some wealth. So I said (to myself): 'If there is a day
that I can better Abu Bakr than it is this one.' So I
went with half of my wealth and the Messenger of
Allah (~ asked me, 'What have you left for your
family?' I replied, 'The same amount.' Then Abu Bakr
came with everything that he possessed and the
Messenger of Allah ('1) as_k ed him, 'What have you
left for your family?' He replied, 'I have left Allah

and His Messenger for them.; So 1 said, 'I will never
be able to better you in anything!'

So what <u mar did here was competition and the permitted
type of jealousy (ghubta), but the state of af-$iddiq was better
than his, and thus he would generally be the victor in such competition due to his indifference to the condition of others.

[2.4 Moses Displays Ghubfa]
Likewise is the case with Prophet Musa as is mentioned in the
padith of Mtrcij that he competed and felt jealousy towards the
Prophet (~ to the point that he,
Cried due to the extent to which the Prophet ~
has surpassed him. So it was said to him, 'Why ar~
you crying?' He replied, 'I ain crying because there is
a servant who shall be sent after me, and more of
his nation shall enter Paradise than mine.' 5

This padith is also reported in other than the Ja(Ji(J with a different wording,

We passed a person while he was saying in a loud
voice, 'You have blessed him and honoured him
(over me).' So we were raised to him and gave him
our salam, he replied to our salam and said, 'Who is
this with you 0 Jibra'Il?' He said, 'This is Al:imad.'
He said, 'Welcome 0 Illiterate Prophet who has c::onveyed the Message of his Lord and sincerely advised his nation.' Then we moved on and l said,
'Who w·as this 0 Jibta>tl?' He replied, 'That was Musa
bin lmran.' l said, 'And who was he censuring?' He

replied, 'He was censµring your Lord with regards
to you.' I said, 'He was raising his voice to His Lord?'
He replied, 'Indeed Allah knew his truthfulness.'

So in this <umar resembled Musa, and the condition of our
Prophet (~was superior to that of Musa for he did not possess any of this permissible jealousy.

[2.5 Whoevers Ranking Becomes Lofty, He is

Similar to this from amongst the $ahabah were Abu <Ubaydah
bin Jarrap and those like him who were free from these types of
concern,s and due to this they were of a more exalted rank than
those who would compete and display jealousy (ghubfa) even
though it was permitted. This is why Abu cubaydah deserved
to be called,
The trusted one of this Ummah. 6

For if the one trusted does not have any rivalry and desire in
his self for the things that he is entrusted with, then he is the
most deserving of having the trust placed in him. The one who
is known to possess no rivalry in greater matters is entrusted
with the smaller matters, and the one is known to have no reason to steal from the wealth is entrusted with the wealth. As for
the one who finds in himself treachery that resembles that of a
wolf entrusted with sheep, then he is not able to discharge the
trust placed in hi111 due to his having in his heart a desire for
what he is entrusted with.

'anhu), that he said,
We were sitting in the presence of the Messenger of
Allah(~ one day and he said, 'A person is .a bout to

arrive from this mountain path who is from the people of Paradise.' So a person from the An~ar arrived, his beard dripping with the water of wudu
and holding his sandals in his left hand, and he gave
us the salam. The next day the Prophet (~ said
words of similar import and the same person appeared in the same condition. On the third day the
Prophet(~ again said words of similar import and
again this person appeared irt the same condition,
so when the Prophet (~ left, <Abdullah bin 'Amr
al-'A~ followed this person and said, 'indeed I have
abused my father and I swore that I would not go
to him for three days so if you would let me stay
with you until those three days expire, I would do
so.' He replied, 'Yes.'

Anas continued saying,
So 'Abdullah told us that he .spend three nights with
this person yet he did not see him stand for the
night prayer at all. All he did was when he turned
sides on his bed he would mention Allah and make
takbir and would do this until he stood for the Fajr
prayer. 'Abdullah said, 'Except that I never heard
him speak except good.' So when the three days
were over I wa~ eager to make little of his actions. I
said, 'O servant of Allah there was no hatred or
disassociation between my father and me but I heard
the Messenger of Allah (~ saying on three occasions, 'A person is about to arrive who is from the
people of Paradise,' and you arrived ort those three

look at your actions and emulate them. But I have
not seen you perform a great deal of actions, so
what is it that has reached you to make the Messenger of Allah (~ say what he said?' He replied, 'It is
nothing more than what you have seen, except that
I do not find in myself any disloyalty to any of the
Muslims, and neither do I find any jealousy for the
wealth that Allah has bestowed upon them.'
'Abdullah said, 'This is that which has. reached you
artd is something that we cannot endure.' -

So in the saying of' Abdullah bin <Amr to him, 'This is something that has reached you and something that we cannot endure'
lies an indication of his lack of jealousy and his being secure
from all types of jealousy. This is why Allah praised the An1dr
with His saying,

And have no jealousy in their breasts for that
which they have been given (the muhiijir! n), and
give them preference over themselves even
though they were in need of that.
[Surah al-f:lashr (59):91

Meaning that which has been given to their brothers from the
Muhcijirim. The scholars of tefsir have stated:
'They do not find in their breasts jealousy and hatred for what has been given to the Muhrijiriin.'

Then some of them said,
'What has been given to them from the war booty.'

And others said:

So they find 110 need of that which has been given the Muh4Jiriin
of wealth and rank even though jealousy arises over these sorts
of things.
Between the Aws and the Khazraj there existed competition

this is competition in that which would bring them closer to

[2.6 Blameworthy Jealousy]
As for the jealousy that is totally blameworthy then Allah has
said with regards to the Jews,

Many of the People of the Book wish that if
they could turn you away as disbelievers after
you have believed, out of envy from their own
selves even after the truth has become clear to
them.
[Siirah af-Baqarah (2):109]

'They wish' meaning that they hope to make you apostasise
from your religion out of jealousy. So jealousy was the deciding
factor behind their wish even after the Truth has been made
clear to them. This is because when they saw you attain what
you attained of blessings - in fact they saw you attain that which
they themselves had never attainec,l - they became jealous of
you. Similarly this is mentioned in another verse,

Or do they envy J!len for what Allah has given
them of His bounty? Then We have already
given the family of Abraham the Book and Wis-

And from the evil of the darkening (night) as it

And from the evil of the envier when he envies.
[Surah al-Falaq (113):1-5]

A group of scholars of tafsir mentioned that this St/rah \\·as
revealed due to the jealousy of the jews harboured to\\.·ards the
Messenger of Allah (~ to the extent that they performed magic
on him. The magic was done by the Jew, Labid bin al-'.\~am."
So the one who is jealous, hating the favours bestowed by
Allah upon someone else is an oppressor, going beyond bounds
due to this. As for the one who dislikes that someone else be
blessed and wishes to be blessed in the same way, then this is
forbidden for him except in that which will bring him closer to
Allah. S0 if he were to wish for something that has been hriven
to someone else whjch would help bring rum closer to .\llah

{2.6 Blameworthy Jealousy]
then there is no problem in this. However, his wishing for it in
his heart, without looking to the condition of someone else is
better and more excellent.
Then if this person were to act, dictated by this jealousy, he
would be an oppressor going beyond bounds, deserving of punishment unless he repents. So the one who is affected by the
one who is jealous is oppressed and should be enjoined to pa~
tience and taqwd. He should be patient of the harm afflicted
upon him by the one who is jealous, and he should forgive and
overlook, just as Allah said,

Many of the People of the Book wish that if
they could turn you away as disbelievers after
you have believed, out of envy from their own
selves even after the truth has become clear to
them. But forgive and overlook until Allah
brings about His Command.
[Surah al-Baqarah (2):109]

Indeed Yusuf, (alayhis salam) was tried by the jealousy of his
brothers:

When they said: Truly, Yusuf and his brother
are loved more by our father than we ...
[Surah Yusuf (12):8]

103

D 1 $EASES 0 F TH E H EAR T r\ N D T 1-1 I;. l R C L' R F S

So they were envied due to their father favouring them over
the rest of the brothers, which is why Ya'qub said to Yusuf,

0 my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they arrange a plot against you. Indeed!
Satan is an open enemy to man!
[Jurah Yusuf (12):51

They went on to oppress him by discussing his murder and
throwing him in the well, and his being sold as a slave by the
ones who took him to the land of the disbelievers, and his subsequently being owned by these disbelieving people. Then after being oppressed, Yusuf was tried by the one who invited
him to an indecent deed and attempted to seduce him, and she
sought aid from anyone who would help her in this but he was
preserved from this. Instead he chose to be imptisoned rather
than perform this indecent deed, preferring the punishment of
this world rather than the Displeasure of Allah (irt the Hereafter).
Hence he was oppressed by the one who desired him due to
her base desires and her corrupt objective. So this love with
which she desired him arose as a result of her succumbing to
the vain desires of her heart, and its happiness or sadness lay in
his accepting or rejecting the temptation. He was also oppressed
by those who hated him with a hatred that led to his being thrown
in the well, then his becoming captive and owned without his
choice, therefore these people removed him from the absolute
freedom that he enjoyed to becoming forced into slavery to the
false worshippers. This forced him to seek refuge in the prison

104

[2. 6 Blamewortf?.y jealousyJ
out of his own free will, thereby making his trial greater.
His patience on this occasion arose out of his own volition
coupled with his fear of Allah, thus differing from his patience
at their oppression, which was having patience at the onset of
calamities, and if one were rtot to be patient at the likes of
these then he would take to the way of mere animals.
This second type of patience, arising from one's free will, is
the more excellent of the rwo. This is. why Allah said,

Indeed he who fears Allah, and is p~tient, then
surely Allah makes not the reward of the doers
of good to be lost.
[Surah Yusuf (12):90j

Likewise when the believer is harmed due to his faith;
and disbelief, transgression artd disobedience is sought from him
- and if he were not to accept this then he would be harmed and
punished - thert he should choose this harm and punishment
over renegading from his religion - even if it results in
imprisonment or banishment from his land - just as was done by
the Muhc!Jirii.n in their choosing to leave their settlements rather
than leave theit religion for which they were harmed and punished.
The Prophet(~ was harmed in a number of different ways
but he was patient through-out this with a patience that arose
out of his own volition, and indeed he was harmed in this way
only that he may do what he did out of his own choice. So this
patience of his was greater than the patience of Yusuf, for only

105

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND TH£1R CURES

an indecent action was sought from Yusuf, and he was only punished by imprisortrnem when he did not comply. But disbelief
was sought from the Prophet (;i) and his Companions, and when
they did not do this - then they were punished by being slaughtered and other such harms - the least of which was imprisonment, for the polytheists imprisoned him artd Bani Hashim for a
time in a mountain pass. Then when Abu Talib died they became more severe against him, and when the An.rdr gave him
the pledge of the allegiance and when the polytheists came to
know of this they tried to prevent him from leaving (for MacUnah)
and tried to detain him and his Companions. Then all of them
emigrated secretly except for <Umar bin al-Khanab and those
like him.
So what befell the believers came about as a result of their
choosing obedience to Allah and His Messenger artd it was not
from the afflictions that occur without the servant's choice of
the type that Yusuf was tried with, and neither of the type of
his being separated from his father. So this.patience endured by
the believers was the nobler of the tWo types of patience, and
its possessors are greater with respect to ranking. This, even
though the one who is tried without his will shall be rewarded
for his patience and his contentment with the decree of Allah,
and his sins will be expiated. As for the person who is tried and
harmed for choosing obedience to Allah, then he will be rewarded for the actual trial and it shall be written as a righteous
action for hirn. Allah, the Most High, said,

106

/ 2. 6 Blameworthy JealouD]
That is because they suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of Allah, nor do
they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but
it is written to their credit as a righteous deed.
Indeed Allah wastes not the reward of the doers of good.
[Siirah at- Ta1vbah (9): 120}

This contrasting with the case of the one who is tried without
his choice, such as being sick, or death, or a thief stealing from
him - this person shall be rewarded for his patience only, not for
the actual trial itself and what results from it. As for those who
are harmed due to their faith in Allah and obedience to Him and
His Messenger, and as a result of this they are in pain, or are
sick, or are imprisoned, or are forced to leave their land, or their
property and family is taken from them, or are beaten and abused,
or their position and wealth is diminished, then in this they are
upon the way of the Prophets and those that followed them
such as the Muhdjiriin.
So these people shall be rewarded for what has harmed them,
and a righteous action shall be written for them due to it just as
the 1mgahid shall be rewarded for the hunger, thirst and fatigue
that afflicts him, and for enraging the disbelievers even if these
effects are not something he has physically set out to do, but
they are resultant from his action (of performingjihaa) that he
has chosen to do. The people have differed over this: can it be
said that these resultant effects are actions of the actor of the
reason for these effects, or are they Actions of Allah, or is there
no actor fot them ? What is correct is that they are shared between the actor of the reason and the (Actor of the) totality of
the reasons, and this is why a righteous action is written for
him.

107

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

The purpose behind this discussion is that jealousy is one of
the sicknesses of the soul, and it is an illness that afflicts the
generality of mankind and only a few are secure from it. This is
why it is said:
The body is never free from jealousy, but debasement brings it out, and nobility hides it.

It was said to al-Hasan al- Ba~d,
'Can a believer be envied?' He replied, 'What has
made you forget y usuf and his brothers, have yo\)
no father?' But you should keep (this envy should it
occur) blinded in your heart, for you cannot be
harmed by that which you did not act upon in speech
or action.'

[2.7 The Cure for Jealousy]
So the one who finds that he harbours jealousy in his soul
towards someone else, then it is upon him to treat it with patience and taqwd of Allah, and dislike it being in his soul. Many
religious people do not take a stance against the one who is
envied and neither do they help the one who would oppress
him, but neither do they establish what is obligatory with respect to his tights. Rather when someone censures the one who
is envied they do not agree with or aid him in the censure but
neither do they mention his praiseworthy qualities. Likewise if
someone were to praise him they remain silent. So these people
are responsible for their leaving what is commanded with respect to the rights of the envied, and they have exceeded the
proper bounds in. this even though they may not have taken a
stance against him. The reward of these people is that their rights
in turn will be neglected and on some occasions they will not be

108

[2. 7 The Cure for Jealousy)
treated fairly, and neither will they be helped against the one
who oppresses them, just as they did not aid the envied who
was oppressed. As for the one who actually takes a stance against
the envied, either with words or actions then he will be punished for this; and the one who fears Allah and is patient and
does not become one of the oppressors -Allah will benefit him
for his taqwa.

[2.8 The Causes for Jealousy]
This is what occurred with Zaynab hint Jahsh (racj!JAl!ahu
<anha) for she used to be one who would vie with 'A'ishah &om

the wives of the Prophet (;I). The jealousy displayed by some
women to others is great, and is especially true of those who
are married to one husband. The woman will go to great extents
to get her allotted time from him for sometimes some of her
allotted time will be m.issed due to his sharing with other wives.
This jealousy commonly occurs amongst those that share authority or property9 in the case when some of them take a share
from it and others are left with none. It also occurs between
those that debate, due to their hatred that their opponent gets
the better of them, such as the jealousy of the brothers of Yusuf,
or the jealousy of the two sons of Adam one to the other for in
this case the brother was envied by the other due to Allah accepting his sacrifice and not the other's, this leading to his murder. Also, the jealousy displayed towards the Muslims by the
Jews. It was said,
The first sins by which Allah was disobeyed were
three: covetousness, arrogance and jealousy. Covetousness was displayed by Adam, arrogance by Iblis,

Or those that share knowledge, this is why the scholars of hadith do not accept

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CL' RES

The manners of the Qur'an is 'the exalted standard
of character.'

As for 'vain desires' then they are temporary anomalous conditions, and 'illness' is sickness - this is art affliction that harms
the heart and corrupts it. In the first pqdith jealousy was mentioned along with hatred. This is because the envier, first of all
dislikes the bounty bestowed by Allah upon the one who is
envied, and then begins hating this person. This is because the
hatred of the thing being bestowed leads to hatred of the one
upon whom it is bestowed, for when the blessings of Allah are
bestowed upon an individual, he would love that they go away,
and they would not go away except by the one who is envied
going away, therefore he hates him and loves that he not be
there.
Jealousy necessarily leads to desire and hatted just as Allah
informed us of those that came before us: that they differed,

[5urah Al 'lmrdn (3):19]

So their differing did not arise due to the lack of knowledge,
rather they knew the Truth; but it was due to some of them
hating others, just as the envier hates the envied.

In $af7i(;sofal-Bukh2.ri and Muslim, Anas bin Malik (rat/!JA!lahu

not oppose each other, and do not cut relations,

rather be servants of Allah as brothers. It is not permissible for a Muslim to disassociate from his brother
fot more than three days such that they meet and
one ignores the other, and the best of them is the
one who initiates the Salam. 14

He (*) said, in the badzth that is agreed to be authentic, reported by Anas also,

Allah, the Most High, said,

There is certainly among you he who would linger behind (from fighting in the Way of Allah).
If a misfortune befalls you, he says: 'Indeed
Allah has favoured me in that I was not present

from Allah, he would surely say - as if there had
never been any ties of affection between you

So these people who lingered behind did not love for their
brother Muslims what they loved for themselves, rather if the
Muslims were afflicted with a calamity, they were overjoyed that
it ortly afflicted them, and if they met with blessings they were
not happy for them, rather they wished that they too had a portion of this blessing. So they would not become happy except
if they received something of this world or some evil of this
world was diverted from them. This was due to them not loving
Allah and His Messenger and the Home of the Hereafter, for if
this had been the case they would have loved their brothers,
and loved what they had received of His blessings and they
would have been hurt by the calamity that had afflicted them.
As for the one who is not made happy by what has made the
Muslims happy, and is not grieved by what has made the Muslims grieve then he is not of them. In the $a/lips of al-Bukhari

Greed is a sickness as is miserliness, and jealousy is worse
than miserliness as occurs in the badith reported by Abu Dawud 18
from the Prophet (~) that he said,
Jealousy eats away at good deeds, just as fire eats
away at firewood, and giving charity extinguishes sins
just as Water extinguishes fire.

This is because the miser only stops himself from having good
but the envier dislikes the favours of Allah bestowed upon His
servants. It is possible that a person give to those lesser than
him who would help hitn achieve his objectives and yet display
jealousy to those of the same level as him just as it is possible
for him to be miserly without displaying envy to others. Greed
is the basis for this as Allah said,

DJ SEAS ES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

In the Saflibs of al-Bukhar! and Muslim t 9 the Prophet(~ said,
Beware of greed for it destroyed those that came
before you: it commanded them to be miserly and
they were; it commanded them to be oppressive and
they were and it commanded them to break the ties
of kinship and they did. 20

<Abdur-Ra}:unan bin <Awf21 used to frequently say in his supplication while make Tawdj,
'O Allah! Save my soul from greed.' So a person
said to him, 'Why 1s this your most frequent
supplication?' He replied, 'When I safeguard myself
from greed, I safeguard myself from greed, miserliness and from severing the ties of kinship.'

And jealousy necessarily leads to oppression.

CHAPTER THREE

The Disease of Desires and
Passionate Love
[3.1 Between Jealousy and Desires]
Miserliness and jealousy are sicknesses that lead to the soul
hating that which would benefit it, and its loving that which
would harm it. This is why jealousy was mentioned alongside
hatred and resentment in the preceding apadith. As for the sickness ot desire and passionate love then this is the soul loving
that which would harm it and coupled with this is its hatred of
that which would benefit it.
Passionate love is a psychological sickness, and when its effects become noticeable on the body, it becomes a sickness that
afflicts the mind also. Either by afflicting the mind by the likes
of melancholy, or afflicting the body through weakness and emaciation. But the purpose here is to discuss its affect on the heart,
for passionate love is the fundament that makes the soul covet
that which would harm it, similar is the one weak of body who
covets that which harms it, and if he is not satiated by that then
he is grieved, and if he is satiated then his sickness increases.

[3.2 The Reality of Passionate love (ishk)]
The same applies to the heart afflicted with this love, for it is
harmed by its connection to the loved, either by seeing, touching, hearing, even think about it. And if he were to curb the
love then the heart is hurt and grieved by this, and if he gives in
to the desire then the sickness becomes stronger and becomes a
means through which the grievance is increased.
In the /;ddith there occurs,
Indeed Allah sheltets His believing servant from the
world just as one of you shelter your sick ones from
food and drink (that would harm them). 1

In the pddith concerning the saving of Musa reported by Wahb 2,
which is recorded by Imam Al:imad in az-Zuhd,
Allah says: 'Indeed I drive away My friends from the
delights of this world and its opulence and comfort
just as the compassionate shepherd drives away his
camel from the dangerous grazing lands. And indeed I make them avoid its tranquility and livelihood,
just as the compassionate shepherd makes his camel
to avoid the resting-places wherein it would be easy
prey. This is not because I consider them to be insignificant, but so that they may complete their portion of My Kindness in safety and abundance, the
delights of the world will not attract him and neither would desires overcome him.'
1

A similar bcidith to this reported by aJ-Bayhaq1 and it is a rja'!f ptidith. (rder to Fay/
af-Qadif;.
2

Wahb ibn Munabbih is a noble tdbti, but this /Jadith is reported from him
directly to the Prophet(~ and is not authentic.

118

[3.2 The Reality ef Pas~ionate love (ishk)]
Therefore the only cure for the sick lies in his removing the
sickness by removing this blameworthy love from his heart.
People are divided into two opinions concerning passionate
love: One group says that if falls into the category of intentions
and wishes, this being the famous opinion. Another groups says
that it falls into the category of imagination and fantasies and
that it is a corruption of the imagination since it causes one to
depict the one who is loved in other than bis true reality. This
group went on to say:

And this is why Allah has not been described w1th
passionate love (ishk) and neither that He passionately loves (ya'shik) because He is far removed from
this, and one cannot be praised who has these corrupt thoughts.

As for the first group, then from them are those who said:
'He is described with passionate love (ishk) because
it is a complete and perfect love and Allah loves
(yuf;ib).'

And it is reported in the narration of <Abdul Wa}:iid bin Zayq
that He said,
'The servant will always continue to draw closer to
me, loving Me and I loving him (A'shiquM).'

This is the saying of some of the Sufis but the majority do not
apply this word to Allah, because passionate love is a love exceeding the proper bounds, as for the Love of Allah then it has
no end and cannot exceed the proper bounds. Passionate love is
to be considered blameworthy without any exceptions, it is not

119

D l S F A S E S 0 F T H E H E A R T A N D T H F l R C l. R E S

to be praised when it is directed towards the Creator or created
because it is a love that exceeds the proper bounds.
This is also true because the word 'passionate love' is only
employed with regards to a man loving a woman or child (or
vice versa), it is not employed in things such as the love of
one's family, property or status, just as it is not employed with
regards tO the love of the Prophets and the righteous. Commonly, youwill find this word being mentioned alongside a forbidden action, such as loving the woman who is not lawful for
him, or loving a child joined with the unlawful glance and touch
and other such unlawful actions.
As for the love of a man for his wife or slave-girl which leads
him out of the folds of justice such that he does unlawful things
for her and leaves what is obligatory - as commonly happens even to the extent that he may oppress his son born of his· old
wife due to this love of his new wife, or to the extent that he
will do things to keep her happy that would harm his religion
and worldly life. For example his singling her out for inheritance
that she does not deserve, or that he gives her family authority
and property that exceeds the limits set by Allah, or he goes to
excesses in spending on her, or he makes unlawful things possible for her which harms his religion and worldly life. This passionate love is forbidden with regards to one who is permissible
for hitn, so how would it be with regards for one who has pas~
sionate love for someone who is 1,mlawfo! or with regards to
two men? For this contains a corruption the extent of which
none can assess except the Lord of the servants; it is a sickness
that corrupts the religion and objectives of the one who possesses it, then it corrupts his intelligence and then his body.

.. .Then do not be soft in speech, lest in whose
heart is a disease should be moved with desire,
but speak in an honourable manner.
[Surah Al;zdb (33) : 32]

There ate some whose hearts contain the disease of desire
and whos.e perceptions ate only skin deep. When the object of
the desire submits; the sickness is satiated; and this satiation
strengthens the desire and pursuit of the object and hence
strengthens the sickness. This is in contrast to the one whose
objective is not met, fot this failure results in removing the satiation that would strengthen the sickness and thereby the desire is weakened as is the love. This is because the person definitely intends that thete be action accompanying his desire; for
otherwise all his desire would be is just whisperings of the soul,
unless there is sotne speech ot looking accompanying this.
As for the one who is afflicted with this passionate love but
holds back and is patient; then indeed Allah will reward hirn for
his taqwii as occurs in the f;adith:
That the one who passionately loves someone yet
hdds back, conceals this and is patient, then dies
upcm this, will be a martyr. '

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THE JR CURES

This f;adith is known to be the report of Ya}:iya al-Qatat from
Mujahid from Ibn <Abbas from the Prophet(~ but it 1s problematic and such a fladith is not to be depended upon.
But it is known from the evidences of the Shari'ah that if one
were to hold back from performing that which is unlawful, be it
looking, speaking or acting, and he conceals this and does not
articulate it so as not to fall into that which is prohibited and he
is patient ih his obedience to Allah and keeping away from disobedience to Allah, despite the pain that his heart feels due to
passionate love, (similar to the case of the one who is patient
through a calamity), then indeed this person would grun the same
reward as those who have feared Allah and been patient.

Verily, he who fears Allah and is. patient, then
surely Allah makes not the reward of the doers
of good to be lost.
[Surah Yusuf (12) ~ 90]

This holds true for the disease of envy and all other sicknesses that afflict the heart. So when the soul pursues that which
would anger Allah, and the person prevents himself from this,
fearing Allah, then he is included in His saying,

[Stirah Ndz'iat (79) : 40-41]

When the soul loves something, it will do all that it can to
attain it) so the one who does this out of having a blameworthy
love or hatred then this action of his would be sinful. For example his hating a person due to envying him and thereby hattning
whosoever is linked to that person - either by preventing his
rights ot by showing them enmity, ot his doing something that
is commanded by Allah but he does it due to his desires and not
for the sake of Allah.
!hese types of sicknesses ate comm.only found in the heart.
The person can hate something and due to this hate, love a great
many things due to mere whitns and fancies. As one poet affected by tbls said,
For the sake of a Sudanese girl he loved Sudan
to the point
that he loved the black dogs due to
his love of her.
So he loved a black girl, and therefore loved all types of black
even the blackness of dogs! All of this is a sickness in the heart
with regards to its imagination, fantasies and desires. We ask
Allah that He eliminate all of the illnesses from our hearts, and
we seek refuge with Allah from evil manners, desires and sicknesses.

[3.3 The Natural Inclination of the Heart
is to love of Allah]
The heart has only been created for the worshjp of Allah, and
this is the natural disposition <Jitrah) upon which Allah created
His servants as the Prophet (~) said,
Every new-born child is born upon the natural disposition and it is his parents tlmt make him a Jew,
Christian or a 1-fagian, as an ~nirnal produces a perfect young animal, do you see any part of its body
amputated?

Then Abu Hurayrah, (racjf:yAl!ahu 'anhu), said, recite if you wish
the saying of Allah,

~~6r;bJl~tSA
The Fifrah of Allah with which He has created
mankind. No change is there in the creation of
Allah.
[Surah Riim (30) : 30] 4

So Allah has made the natural disposition of His servants to
love Him and worship Him Alone, so if the natural disposition
was to be left as it is without corrupting it, then it would be
cognizant of Allah, loving Him Alone; but the natural disposition does become corrupted due to the sickness of the heart such as the parents making it a Jew or a Christian - even though
this be by the Will and Predecree of Allah, just like the body is
altered by amputation. But even after this it is possible for the
heart to return to the natural disposition if Allah makes this
4

Reported by al~Bukhari and Muslim.

124

[3.3 The Natural Inclination of the Heart is to love of Alfdh]

easy for the one who does his utmost to return it to the natural
disposition.
The Messengers were sent to affirm and re~establish the natural disposition .and to perfect it, not to alter it. So when the
heart loves Allah Alone, making the religion sincerely for Him,
it will not be tried by the love of anyone else, not to mention be
tried with passionate love because were it to be afflicted with
passionate love then this would diminish its loving Allah .alone.
This is why when Yusuf was tried with this passionate love
(directed to him) his love of Allah Alone, making the religion
sincerely for him, did not allow him to be overcome by this,
rather Allah said,

As for the wife of al- <Aziz, it was because she was and her
nation were polytheists that she was afflicted with passionate
love. No one, is afflicted with passionate love except that this
diminishes his singling out Allah Alone for worship .and his faith.
The heart that repents to Allah, fearing Him, has two routes by
which it can remove this passionate love:

D l S E r\ S E S <> F T H f·: H E .\ R T .\ N D T f I t ·: I .R ( : L- R I: S

[3..4 Preventative Measur.es from Passionate

Love]
1) Repenting to Allah and lov_iog Him, for indeed this is more
satisfying and purer than anything else, and nothing will be left
to love along side Allah.
2) Fearing Allah, for indeed fear is the opposite of passionate
love and removes it.
So everyone who loves something, with passion or otherwise,
then this love can be removed by loving that which is more
beloved to compete with it.~
This love can also be removed by fearing the occurrence of a
harrn that is more hateful to one than leaving this love. So when
Allah is more beloved to the servant than anything else, and
more feared by him than anything else; then he will not fall into
passionate love or find any love that would compete with his
love of Allah, ex_cept in the ca_se of negligence or at a time when
this love and fear has become weak by his leaving some of the
obligatory duties and by performing some of the prohibited actions. For indeed faith increases with obedience and decreases
with disobedience, so each time a servant obeys Allah .out of
love and fear, and leaves a prohibited action out of love and
fear, his love and fear becomes stronger, and any love or fear of
anything else besides Allah will disappear from his heart.

concerning this.

[3.5 Some Cures for the Heart]
The same is true for the sickness of the body; for the health
of the body is preserved by the same, and the sickness is repressed by the opposite. The correctness of the faith in the
heart is preserved by its like, meaning that which would breed
faith in the heart from the beneficial knowledge and righteous
action for these are its nourishment as occurs in the f;adith of
Ibo Mas<ud, reported as his saying and as a padith of the Messenger (;;I),
Indeed every host loves that people come to his table spread, and indeed the table spread of Allah is
the Qur'an.

So the Qut'an is the table spread of Allah.
From those things that nourish the heart are supplication at
the end of the night, the times of Adhdn and lqdmah, in his
prostration, at the ends of the prayers 6 - add to this repentance.
For indeed the ohe who repents w Allah and then in turn Allah
forgives him, He will then give him enjoyment for an appointed
time. That he takes to reciting the reported adhkar for the day
and at the time he sleeps. That he bears with patience what he is
enticed with that would divert him from all of this, for Allah
will immediately aid him with a spirit from Him and write faith
in his heart. That he be eager to complete the obligatory duties
such as the five prayers inwardly and outwardly for they are the
pillars of the i:eligion. That his words of recourse be

for by them heavy burdens can be born, horrors can be overcome, and the servant be gifted with the best of conditions to
live in. That he should not give up the supplication and seeking
help from Allah, fot the servant will be answered as long as he is
not hasty, saying.
I have supplicated and supplicated but I have not
been answered. 8

That he should know that help comes with patience, that relief comes after anxiety and distress, that after every period of
difficulty there follows a period a period of ease. 9
That he knows that no prophet or one less than him was rewarded with a good end except as a result of his being patient.
And all praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Lord of Creation. To Him belongs praise and grace for guiding us to Islam
and the Sunn.ah, a praise that would suffice His favours to us
outwardly and inwardly, as in required for the nobility of His

Imam ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah
may Allah have mercy upon him.

129

IBN QAYYIM AL-JAWZIYYAH

May Allah have mercy upon him

His Name:
He is the Imam, the I:lafi~, the exegete, the legal jurist, Shaykh
al-Islam: Abu (Abdullah Shamsu-d-Din Mul)amtnad Ibn Abu Bakr
- better known as Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah.

His Birth and Education:
He was born into a noble and knowledgeable family on 71h
Safar 691H in the village of Zar>, near Damascus, Syria.

From an early age he set about acquiring knowledge of the
Islamic sciences from the scholars of his time. Describing his
desire for knowledge, al-J:-Iafi? Ibn Rajah, Dhtryl Tabaqat-1lfandbilah [4/449] said, 'He had an intense love for knowledge,
for books, publications and writings.'
Ibn Kathir, al~Bidqyah wa-n-Nihqyah [14/235] said, 'He acquired
from such books what others could not acquire, and he
developed a deep understanding of the books of the Salaf and

130

lbnQayyim al-Jawzjyyah
of the Khalaf.'

His Teachers and Shaykhs:
They include Shihab an-Nablusi, QacJI TaqI ad-Din ibn
Sulaymin, from whom he studied }:iadith; QaQi Badr ad-Din jbn
Jama' ah; Safi ad-Din al-Hindl; Isma'il ibn Mu}:iammad al-HarranI,
from whom he studied fiqh and usw; and also his father, from
whom he learnt the laws of inheritance.
However, the most notable of his teachers was Shaykh allslam Ibn Taymiyyah, whom he accompanied and studied under
for sixteen years. Al-J:Iafi? Ibn Kathir (14/234) said, 'He attained
great proficiency in many branches of knowledge; particularly
knowledge of tafsir, 1).adith, and usUl. When shaykh Taqi adDin ibn Taymiyyah returned from Egypt in the year 712H, he
stayed with the shaykh until he died; learning a great deal of
knowledge from him, along with the knowledge that he had
already occupied himself in attaining; So he became a unique
scholar in many branches of knowledge.'

His Manners and Worship:
Many of his students and contemporaries have born witness
to his excellent character and his manners of worship. Ibn Raj ab
(4/450) said,
He - may Allah have mercy on him - was constant
in worship and performing the night prayer,
reaching the limits in lengthening his prayer and
devotion. He was constantly in a state of dhikr and
had an intense love for Allah. He also had a deep
love for turning to Allah in repentance, humbling
himself to Him with a deep sense of humility and

131

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

helplessness. He would throw himself at the doors
of Divine obedience and servitude. Indeed, I have
not seen the likes of him with regards to such matters.

Ibn Kathir (14/234) said,
He was constant in humbly entreating and calling
upon his Lord. He recit:ed well and had fine manners.
He had a great deal of love and did not harbour
any envy or malice towards anyone, nor did he seek
to harm or find faµlt with them. I was one of those
who most often kept company with him and was
one of the most beloved of people to him. I do
not know of anyone in the world in this time, who
is a greater worshipper than him. His prayer used to
be very lengthy, with prolonged bowing and
prostrations. His colleagues would criticise him for
this, yet he never retorted back, nor did he abandon
this practice. May Allah bestow His mercy upon him.

His Students and Works:
Amongst his most prominent students were: Ibn Kathir
(d.774H), adh-DhahabI (d.748H), Ibn Rajah (d.751H) and Ibn
cAbdu-1-HadI (d.744H), as well as two of his sons, Ibrahim and
Sharafu-d-Din (Abdullah.
Ibnu-1-Qayyim authored over sixty works. His books and
writings are characterised by their touching address to the heart
and soul, as well as their accuracy, precision, strength of
argument and depth of research.
In the field of fiqh and usul, his writings include: I'limu-1Muwaqqibfn; Turuqu-1-Jjukmiyyah; lghdthatu-1-Lahfdn; Tubfatu-1Mawlud; Af.;kdm Ahlu-1-Dhimmah; and al-Furitsiyyah.

Two books have also been written collating the exegetical
comments of ibn al-Qayyim from his various works: Tafsir 4/.
Qayyim and Tafsir al-Munir.
A few of his works have also been translated into the English
language: the Magnificent Journey; the Invocation of God;
Medicine of the Prophet; Zcid al-Ma'cid

Statements of the Scholars about him:
Ibn Rajah (4/44) said,
He had de~p knowledge concerning tafsir and the
fundamentals of the religion, reaching the highest
degree concerning them both. Similar was the case

133

DISEASES 0 F THE HEART /\ND THEIR CURES

in the field of l:iadith, with regards to understanding
its meanings, subtleties and deducing rulings from
them. Likewise was the case in the field of fiqh and
its usul, as well as the Arabic language. He did a great
service to these sciences. He was also knowledgeable
about rhetoric, grammar, and sufuk as weU as the
subtleties and details that occur in the speech of the
people of tasawwuj

Al-Hafi? Ibn Jjajar, ad-Duraru-1-Kdminah (4/21);
He possessed a courageous spirit as weU as vast and
comprehensive knowledge. He had deep knowledge
concerning the differences of opinions of the
Scholars and about the ways of the Salaf.

Ibn Bajar also said in his commendation to ar-Raddu-1-Wafir,
And if there were no virtues of shaykh Taqr ad-Din
[Ibn Taymiyyah], except for his famous student,
shaykh Shamsu-d-Drn ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah ~
the author of many works, which both his opponents
and supporters benefited from - this woµJd be a
sufficient indication of his [Ibn Taymiyyah's] great
position.

al-Hafi? Ibo Na~ir ad-Dimishqi, ar-Raddu-l-W4ftr [p. 69] said,
He possessed knowledge of the sciences, especially
tafsir and usul.

He also said:
AbU Bakr Mul:iammad Ibn al-Muhlb said~ as found
in his letter, "I said in front of our Shaykh, al-Mizzi,
'Is Ibnu-1-Qayyim at the same level as Ibn

134

Khuzaymah?' He replied, 'He is in this time, what
Ibn Khuzaymah was in his time."'

As-Suyutj:, Bugf?yatu-1-Wi'dt (1/62] said,
His books had no equal and he strove and became
one of the great Imams in (the field ofj tafsir, }:iaruth,
the Book, the Sunnah, furu', and the Arabic
language.

<All al-Qari, al-Mirqtit [8/251],
It will be clear to whoever aspires to read the
explanation of Manazilu-s-S::Cirin [i.e. Maddrij as~
Salikin], that they [Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibnu-1Qayyim] are from the great ones of Ahlu-s-Sunnah
wa-1-Jamifah, and from the awl!Jd' of this Ummah.

Qa91 Burhan ad-Din az-Zur<a said as quoted from him in Dh~I

Tabaqtit ai-ijandbilah,
There is none under the heavens who has greater
knowledge than he.

His Death:
Imam Ibrtu-1-Qayyim passed away at the age of sixty, on the
13th night of Rajah, 751H, may Allah shower His Mercy upon

him.

APPENDIX ONE

The Types of Hearts 1
Because the heart is described as possessing life or death, it is
classified into three types:

The Correct and Sound Heart
This is the truthful and sound (salim) heart. It is the only type
of heart that a person can bring to Allah on the Day of Judgement which will rescue him. Allah, Exalted is He says,

0::tM•/j~;1u\Jt:;:/l(~}~;'1;j~&1if
... the Day when neither wealth nor sons will be
of any use - except for he who comes to Allah
with a sound and flawless heart.
[ash-Shu'ard' (26): 88-89]

The meaning of salim (secure) is sdlim (the one who is secure),
it has come in this form because it depicts an innate attribute or
description of the described. As such it is grammatically like
the words tall (tawz1), short (qafir), or graceful and charming

(zarif).
'Taken from lghdthatu-1-1 ,aqfdnJi MafqJ•id ash-.\hqrtan 11 / 11-191 of lmarn ibn alQayyim, may Allah have mercyupon him.

The Correct and Sound Heart
Therefore the one whose heart is described as salim is characterised so because this attribute of truthfulness and soundness
has become its constant and established quality. In this respect
it is like the terms, 'the one who knows' (alim) and 'the one
who has power' (qadir).
It is also the opposite of diseased (marit/); sick (saqim) and
ailing ( ali~.
People have described the sound and truthfu1 heart in different ways. However they all revolve around the following basic
concept,
[The truthful and sound heart] is that which is secure from every carnal desire that opposes the order and prohibition of Allah. lt is secure from every
doubt and uncertainty that would obscure or go
against His narrative. lt is secure from displaying servitude to any other than Him; just as it is ~ecure from
seeking ruling from any other than His Messenger
(~.Therefore it becomes sound through loving
Allah and seeking the tulirtg of His Messenge:r; It
becomes sound thmugh showing Him feat, hope,
crust and reliance; penitence; and hµrnility; it prefers
what pleases Him in every circumstance-and distances
itseJ f from everything that would displease Him in
every possible way. This is the reality of ·s ervitude
(ubudf1yah) which tan only be ditectedto Allah Alone.

Therefore the truthful and sound heart is that heart which is
secure from committing any form of shirk whatsoever and ins read its servitude is directed only to, and purely for., Allah,
Exalted is He. Its desire, love, trust and reliance, penitence;
humility, fear and hope is only for Allah and its actions are purely

137

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

for His sake. Hence if it loves, it loves for the sake of Allah; if
it hates, it hates for the sake of Allah; if it gives, it gives for the
sake of Allah; and if it withholds, it withholds for the sake of
Allah.
But this alone does not suffice until the heart becomes secure
from submitting to, and going to anybody else but, the Messen~
ger of Allah ~ for judgement. Therefore the heart ties a firm
bond with him(~, resolving to follow him and obey him alone
in sayings and actions. These sayings comprise the saying of the
heart: the matters of belief; and the sayings of the tongue which
convey what the heart contains. These actions comprise the actions of the heart: its desire, love, dislike and other connected
matters; and the actions of the limbs.
Therefore the judge for all these matters - the major and minor of them - is that which the Messenger (~ came with. Hence
the heart does not put itself before him in any matter related to
belief, saying, or action. Allah, Exalted is He, says,

0 you who believe! Do not put yourself forward in front of Allah and His Messenger...
[Al-/fl!}urat (49): 1]

meaning: do not speak of a matter until he has spoken of it
and do not act until he has commanded it.
Some of the Salaf said,
There is no action, even if it be small,

138

The Correct and Sound Heart
except that rwo records will be unfurled for it:
why? how?

meaning: why did you do it? How did you do it?
The first question enquires about the cause, onset and motive
of the action. Was it done for some temporal and worldly gain
such as attaining the praise of people? Was it done for feat of
people's censure? Or was the motivation of this action establishing the rights of servitude, seeking the increase of ones love
of, and closeness, to Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, and
seeking the means of drawing dose (wasilah) to Him?
The essence of this question is: was it upon you to perform
this action for the sake of your Master or for the sake of personal gain and base desire?
The second question enquires about the following of the Messenger (~ in that action of worship: was the action you did
from those actions which have been legislated upon the tongue
of My Messenger? Or was it an ;iction that I did not legislate
and was not pleased with?
therefore the first question concerns sincerity (ikhld.f) and
the second concerns following (mutciba'ab). Allah does not accept any action until both these pre-requisites are met.
The method of absolution from the fl.est question is. to purify
ones sincerity such that it is for Allah Alone.
The method of absolution from the second question is to
actualise the following of the Messenger (~ and by securing
the heart from any intent that would impair its sincerity and arty
base desire that would impair its following.

139

D1SEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

This is the reality of the sound and truthful heart from which
ensues victory and bliss.

The Dead Heart
This is the heart that contains no life. It does not know its
Lord and it does not worship Him by complying to His command and doing that which He loves and is pleased with. Instead it is a slave to its carnal desires, temptations) and pleasures; oblivious of, and indifferent to whether they lead to the
displeasure of its Lord and His anger or not. Therefore it wor~
ships other than Allah: it directs its love, hope, pleasure, displeasure, glorification, and submission to other than Him. If it
loves, it loves for the sake of its base desires; if it hates, it hates
for the sake of its base desires; if it gives, it gives for the sake
of its base desires; if it withholds, it withholds for the sake of
its base desires. It gives preference to its base desires and these
are more beloved to it than the pleasure of its Master.
Base desires are its leader, carnal desires are its commander,
ignorance is its driving force, and negligence is the vessel upon
which it embarks. It is completely engrossed in pursuing its
worldly desires. It is driven wild by the intoxication of its base
desires and love of temporal things. It hears the call to Allah
and the Abode of the Hereafter from a distant place and does
not respond to the sincere advisor. It follows every cunning
devil and the world is the cause of its anger and its pleasure.
Base desires have deafened it and blinded it to anything other
than falsehood. In this world it is like that which is said concerning Layla,
An enemy to whosoever she displays enmity
and at peace w:i th those she likes
Whosoever she draws close to,

140

The Dead Heart
he loves and draws close to.

Mixing with the person who has this heart is a sickness, interacting with him is poison, and sitting with him is ruin.

The Diseased Heart
This is the heart that contains life but also possesses a defect.
It has two impulses calling it: one leading it to life and the other
leading it to death; and it follows whichever of the two that
predominates.
It contains love of Allah, Exalted is He, faith in Him, sincerity to Him, and trust -and reliance upon him: those matters that
are essential to its life.
It also contains the love of its tarnal desires, giving preference to them, and eagerness to attain them. It contains jealousy,
arrogance, self-amazement, and love of ranking through attaining leadership: those matters that necessarily lead to its destruction and ruin.
It is constantly being tried by two callers: one calling it to
Allah, His Messenger, and the Abode of the Hereafter; and the
other calling it to temporal, worldly matters. It izesponds to the
one that is closest and most influential at the time.

Therefore the first type of heart is the living, humble, soft,
attentive and heedful he-art. The second type is the brittle, dry,
and dead heart. The third type is the diseased heart, either it is
closer to its salvation or it is closer to its devastation.
Allah, the Glorious, has mentioned these types of the hearts

141

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

in His saying,

Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet
before you without Shaf!~m insinuating something into his recitation while he was reciting.
But Allah revokes whatever Sha)1an insinuates
and the Allah confirms His Signs, Allah is AllKnowirtg, All-Wise. That He may m~ke what
Shaytan insinuates a trial for those in whose
heart is a disease and whose hearts are hardened. Indeed the wrongdoers are entrertched in
hostility. And that those who have been givert
knowledge may know that it [the Qur1an] is the
truth from your Lord, that they may believe
therein and their hearts may submit to it with
humility. Indeed Allah is the Guide of thos~ who
believe, to the Straight Path.
Vil-Jjajj (22): 52-54]

In these three verses, Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, has
mentioned two types of hearts put to trial and one type that is
victorious. The two types of heart that are put to trial are the

142

The Diseased Heart
diseased and the harsh heart. The victoribUs heart i_s the heart
of the believer that is humble before its Lord; it is at rest and
satisfied with Him, submissive and obedient to Him.
It is desired of the heart and other limbs that they be healthy
and sound, having no defect so that they can do that which
agrees to their nature and fulfil the purpose for which they were
created. The hearts' stepping outside the bounds of Steadfastness in obedience (istiqdmah) could either be due td its dryn:ess
and harshness, or the absence of doing that which is desired of
it. In this respect it is like a mute tongue or an eye that cannot
see, or only partially see, due to some form of illness or defect.
This is why the hearts have been classified into three types:
1. The healthy and sound heart which contains no impediment
preventing it from accepting the truth, loving it, and giving
it preference other than its coming to know of it. Therefore
its comprehension of the truth is correct and it accepts it
with complete submission.
2. The dead, harsh and dry heart that does not accept the truth
nor submit to it.
3. The diseased heart, when its disease predominates, it joins
the ranks of the dead and harsh heart; but if its soundness
predominates, it joins the ranks of the truthful and sound
heart.
Anything that is directed to the person by Shayran such as his
making him hear certain words, or suggests to the heart su<;h as
suspicion and doubt acts as a trial for the latter two types of
hearts and serves to further strengthen the living, truthful and
sound heart.

This is because the living heart rejects all of this, dislikes it,

143

D l S E A S E S 0 F T H E H E A R T A N D T H E I R C l' R E S

and is angered by it for it knows that the truth opposes it. Therefore it submits to the truth and is content with it. It knows the
fallacy of that which Shaytan has tempted it with and therefore
increases with res'pect to its certainty of the truth, its love of it,
and its rejection of falsehood.
However the heart put to trial remains in doubt and dispute
concerning what was directed to it by Shayran. The healthy and
sound heart, on the other hand, is not harmed by what Shaytan
directs to it.
Hudhyafah bin al-Yaman said that the Messenger of Allah{~
said, "Trials and tribulation will be presented to the heart [one
after another] in the same way that the mat is knitted together,
reed by reed. Any heart that accepts them will have a black spot
form on it. Any heart that rejects them will have a white spot
put on it until the hearts end up being one of two types; a black
heart, murky and like an overturned vessel, it does not know
the good and does not reject the evil, all it knows is its base
desires; and a white heatt which will not be harmed by trials for
as long as the heavens and the earth remain. " 2
Hence he likened the onset of trials upon the heart to knotting the reeds of a mat, one after the other.
He divided the heatts into two types based on how they react
to these trials:
1. A heart that infuses trials when exposed to them in the same
way that a sponge soaks in water. Therefore it has a black
spot fonn on it, and it will keep on accepting these trials
until it becomes totally black and inverted. This is the mean~
2

Muslim.

144

The Diseased Heart
ing of his saying, 'like an overturned vessel' i.e. inverted.
Then when it becomes black and inverted, it is subjugated
to the following two dangerous diseases that push it to destruction:
a. Its confusion of good and evil such that it does not
know the good or reject the evil. It is also possible
that its disease dupe a person into believing good to
be evil, evil to be good, Sunnah to be bid'ah, bid'ah to
be Sunnah, truth to be falsehood, and falsehood to
be truth.
b. Its giving precedence to its base desires when seeking judgement rather than that which the Messenger
(~ came with, its yielding to them, and following
them.
2. A white heart that has been set ablaze with the light of faith
and its niche has been illuminated. When a trial is presented
to it, it rejects it and repels it and hence its light, blaze, and
strength increase.
The trials that are presented to the hearts are the causes of its
disease. They are the trials of carnal desires and doubts, the
trials of aimless wandering and misguidance, the trials of sins
and innovations, and the trials of oppression and ignorance. The
first type·' lead to the corruption of desire and intent and the
second type 4 lead to the corruption of knowledge and belief.
The Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) divided
the hearts into four categories as is authentically reported from
Hudhayfah bin al-Yaman, 'The hearts are of four types: The heart
that has exclusively been illuminated by a blazing torch and that
is the heart of the believer; the heart that is encased and that is
'carnal desires
i

doubts

145

DISEASES OP THE HEART AND THEIR CURES

the heart ofthe disbeliever; the heart that is inverted and that is
the heart of the hypocrite - he knew only to reject, and he saw
only to become blind; and the heart that has two impulses: an
impulse calling it to faith and an impulse calling it to hypocrisy:
it belongs to the impulse that is most prominent.; 5
The meaning of his saying, 'a heart that has exclusively... ' means
a heart that has detached itself of everything besides Allah and
His Messenger. Therefore it has separated and secured itself
from everything save the truth.
The meaning of his saying, 'illuminated by a blazing torch'
refers to the niche of faith. Therefore he indicated by his words,
'that has exclusively... ' that is secure from false doubts and
misguiding carnal desires. He indicated by his words, 'a blazing
torch' that it was set ablaze and illuminated by the light ofknowledge and faith.
The 'encased heart' refers to the heart of the disbeliever because it is wrapped by a veil and covering and hence the light of
knowledge and faith cannot reach it. This is as Allah said, relating from the Jews that,
'"r·" ·.> r:'.'--J P

11.u-: '

~.,;;_,i.; ~ .J

They say: our hearts are wrapped ...
V4-lBaqarah (2): 88]

This veil is the covering that Allah has placed on their hearts
by way of punishment for their rejecting the truth and being
too arrogant to accept it. Therefore it is a covering upon the
hearts, a seal for the ears, and blindness for the eyes. This is the
obscuring screen upon the eyes talked about in His saying,
5

Reported by ibn Ab! Shaybah, af-lman [p. 171 and others with a ~al)i:}:l isnad.

146

The Diseased Heart

And when you recite the Qur>an, We out between
you and those who believe not in the Hereafter,
an obscuring screen. We have put coverings over
their hearts lest they should understand it and
deafness in their ears.
V41-1srd' (17): 45A6J

When the people who have these types of hearts are admonished to purify their Taw(lid and following (ittibaj, they turn on
their heels and run!
The 'inverted heart' refers to the heart of the hypocrite as
Allah, the Exalted says;

Then what is the matter with you that you are
divided into two parties regarding the hypocrites? Allah has cast them back [to disbelief]
because of what they have earned.
V4n-Nisd' (4): 88}

meaning: he caused them to relapse and return to the
falsehood that they used to be in due to their working false
deeds.
This is the most evil of hearts and the vilest of them for it
believes faJsehood to be the truth and shows love and allegiance

147

DISEASES OF THE HEART AND THElR CURES

to those who follow it. It also believes the truth to be falsehood
and displays enmity to those who follow it. The Aid of Allah is
sought!
The 'heart that has two urges' refers to the heart that is not
entrenched in faith because it has not devoted itself solely to
the truth that Allah sent His Messenger with. Instead it contains some faith and some of its opposite: it is closer to disbelief than faith sometimes; and at other times it is closer to faith
than disbelief. The heart follows whatever is most influential at
that time.
