Foreword
This book is a translation o f the following book which is known via two
names: al-Jawab a l-K a fiL im a n S ’al ‘A n al-D aw a’a l-S h a fi and A l- D a ’ W a
al-D aw d’. It has been recognized as one o f the most impactful books in
disciplining the soul, deterring from sin and encouraging sincere
repentance.
The author, al-Imam Ibn al-Qayyim, is considered by the scholars o f
Islam to be a well-versed scholar and sincere advisor who refers to the
Perfect Book o f Allah and the Sunnah whilst simultaneously purifying
his authorships o f any dependency on Greek philosophy and notions
that contradict the Q u r’an and Sunnah.
This book was a response to a question posed by an individual who was
afflicted by a calamity, finding himself in a dire and needy state. He
acknowledged to himself that if he failed to rid himself o f this ailment it
would destroy him in this life and the next. He had endeavoured to
relieve himself o f this affliction, but its severity and intensity grew.
Consequently, Ibn al-Qayyim diagnosed his condition and understood
the request w ithin the question, providing an answer that was detailed
and appropriate. W ithin his answer contained preventative measures,
consequences o f obedience to Allah, the harms o f sins and an adequate
means o f ridding oneself from such suffering.
T h e P rin t U sed for th e T ra n sla tio n
This translation has been taken from the Arabic version which has been
printed and is based on four manuscripts dating back to the 8th century
Hijri. O ne o f them was transcribed 19 years after Ibn al-Q ayyim ’s death.

T he Disease And T h e C ure

Also, further reference was made to two other manuscripts which date
back to the 12th century Hijri.
A scrib in g th e B o o k to a l-Im a m Ibn a l-Q a y y im
Scholars who have studied the life and works o f al-Imam Ibn al-Qayyim
have established this book as one o f his many compositions. The first to
do so was his own student and a scholar in his own right, Ibn Rajab alHanball.
The evidence o f this ascription is within this book itself, as the author
alludes to numerous passages from his other works, clearly portraying
and reinforcing his methodology therein. This is clear to see for the
reader as they will come across his reference to 'A ym a n a l-Q u r’an', which
is also known and printed as ‘A t-T ib y a n fi Aqsam a l-Q u r’a n . Also, he
alluded to his other work, ‘Ijtim a ’al-Juyush al-Islam iyah ’and ‘A s-S a w a iq
al-Mnrsalali' in various segments throughout the book. Lastly, he refers
to his own teacher, Ibn TaymTyah, by quoting his stances and opinions
in various issues in multiple passages.
T itle o f th e B o o k
It has never been documented that the author himself titled the book.
Instead, he proceeded to answer the question w ithout ever attributing a
title to his response. Nevertheless, it has been noted that his student, Ibn
Rajab, was the first to title the book. He named it ‘A l- D a ’ W a al-D aw a’
(The Illness and The Cure). This book is also known by many as ‘alJamab a l-K a fi Lim an S ’al A n al-D aw a’ al-Shafi’ (The Sufficient Answer
for the One W ho Asked About the Remedial Cure) which was
attributed to the book at a later time. Due to this, many scholars have
accepted and confirmed that the more suitable and authentic title is ‘A l D a ’ W a al-D aw a' (The Illness and The Cure).

T he Disease And T h e Cure

T h e T o p ic
As aforementioned, this book was written as a response to a question.
The question was as follows:
W hat do the distinguished scholars, the vanguards of the religion - may Allah
be pleased with them all - say regarding a man who has been trailed with a
calamity and knows that if it continues it shall ruin his worldly affairs as well
as his afterlife? This is despite the fact that he has endeavoured to repel it from
himself with every means though it only increases in intensity and severity.
W hat is the method in repelling it? H ow can it be resolved?
M a y Allah have mercy on the one who aids the afflicted one. “A llah A ids His
servant as long as he aids his brother.'” Provide us with a verdict. M ay Allah
have mercy on you, and may H e be pleased with you.

Irrespective o f the detail behind the question, the questioner withheld
from m entioning the exact affliction that had overtaken them. The
author follows suit and, likewise, withholds from explicitly mentioning
the calamity which afflicted the questioner. Nevertheless, he wrote
numerous chapters pertaining to sincere supplication; its effects on an
individual; sins and their types and their detrimental consequences
whilst paying attention to major sins - polytheism being the most
severe; murder; and the negative impact o f fornication and lewd acts
throughout society.
Further, he alluded to the above being the possible reason behind the
question. Thereafter, he proceeded to immediately answer the question
directly from the Sunnah by firstly m entioning the authentic hadith that

1 C o lle c te d by M uslim . B o o k o f R e m e m b ra n c e a n d S u p p licatio n [2699],

IX

T he Disease And T h e C ure

has been authenticated in the Sahih o f al-Bukhari1on the authority o f
Abu Hurairah who narrated from the Prophet who said:
“A llah did not decree the descent o f any illness, except that H e revealed a
remedy for it."

From the onset, the author presents an answer and a remedy deeply
rooted in the Q u r’an and the Sunnah that medical doctors would
struggle to administer. It is undoubtedly a remedy for the heart and soul
before the body.
The detail and length in the answer is a method used by his own teacher
- Ibn Taymlyah - as mentioned by Imam Ibn al-Qayyim in Madarij asSdlihiti who quoted his shaykh as saying: “I f a questioner puts forth a
question, it is considered a higher quality of knowledge to provide a sufficient
answer, and your answer should not be restricted to what merely solves the
necessary issue at hand."

T h e A u th or
He is al-Imam Shams al-Dln Abu Abdullah Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr
bin Ayyub Ibn Sa d bin Harlz A z-Zar’ee Al-Dimashql, famously known
as Ibn Qayyim al-JawzTyah (691 - 751H).
Ibn al-Qayyim was born on the seventh o f the month o f Safar in the
Hijri year 691. He was nurtured in a household known for righteousness
and Islamic scholarship in a town approximately fifty-five miles south
east o f Damascus. Ibn al-Qayyim excelled in many sciences o f Islamic
knowledge such as Q u r’an exegesis, jurisprudence, Hadlth studies and
much more under the tutelage o f well-renowned scholars. The most
prominent o f them being Shaykh al-Islam Ibn TaymTyah whom he
maintained a close relationship with until he passed away in the year

1 B o o k o f M ed icin e [5678].

T he Disease A nd T h e C ure

728H. He benefitted a tremendous am ount o f knowledge from his
teacher and conveyed the knowledge he learnt on through the
generation. It could be said that the most distinguishing benefit that he
learnt from his teacher(s) was adhering to the principles and foundations
clearly revealed in the Q ur’an and Sunnah upon the understanding o f
the Salaf (Pious Predecessors) whilst rejecting any opposition to the
divine revelation. This gave way to a much-needed revival o f many
aspects o f knowledge that were caused to diminish by those who held
onto false opinions and creed.
S om e o f Ibn a l-Q a y y im ’s S tudents
1. Imam Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali, a well-renowned scholar and jurist. He
passed away in the year 795H.
2. The major scholar and Imam ofTafsTr Imadu-deen Ismail bin Umar
bin Kathlr who lived in Damascus and sought knowledge from its
major scholars. He possessed in-depth knowledge o f Q u r’an and
HadTth. He is the author o f many books including ‘TafsTr Ibn Kathlr’
(The Exegesis o f the Q u r’an) and ‘Al-Bidayah W a al-Nihayah’. He
passed away in the year 774H.
3. Al-Imam Shams al-DIn Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Ahmad bin
Abdul-Hadl bin al-Humaid bin Abdul-Hadl bin Yusuf bin
Muhammad bin Qudamah al-MaqdisI, a scholar well-versed in
many fields o f Islamic knowledge. Al-Imam Ad-Dhahabl mentions
in his regard: “By Allah, I have never met him except that I have
gained some benefit from him .” He passed away in the year 744H.
S om e T estim o n ie s o f Scholars for Ibn a l-Q a y y im
Ibn Rajab: “A scholar in tafsir, the principles o f the religion, meticulous
in deriving verdicts, a scholar in jurisprudence and its principles and the
Arabic language. He was a man who would strive in worship,

XI

lengthening his prayers, constant in remembrance o f Allah, submissive
before his Lord. 1 never witnessed anyone like him or anyone more
knowledgeable or anyone more well versed in the meanings o f the text
o f the Q ur’an and Sunnah or the reality o f true faith. He is not infallible,
but I haven’t seen anyone like him.”
Ad-Dhahabi: “He placed particular focus on Hadlth and its science, he
would busy himself with fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and was excellent
in it.”
Ibn Kathlr: “He excelled in many sciences, especially exegesis o f the
Q u r’an.”
Al-ShawkanT: “He would restrict himself to the authentic evidences, he
would implement them whilst shunning any opinions that conflict with
the evidence. He would propagate the truth in an uncompromising
manner.”
H is D ea th
Ibn al-Qayyim passed away on the tw enty-third o f the m onth o f Rajab
in the year 751H. The funeral prayer was performed over his body the
next day in the grand mosque o f Damascus. May Allah bestow His
Mercy upon him and admit him into the highest level o f Paradise.

It must be noted that the translation at hand aims to convey the meaning
o f the Arabic text from the original words o f the author as accurately as
possible. It has also been presented in a manner to suit an Englishspeaking audience. Therefore, we have relied on the meaning o f the text
rather than a literal translation in particular parts o f the book. In
addition, on the very rare occasion where segments have been omitted.

T h e Disease And T h e C ure

this was a carefully thought through decision taken by the translation
and editing team in light o f particular circumstances.

In the Name of Allah,
Al-Rahman, Al-Rahim
There Is N o Ability to Change, or Strength W ithout
Allah, The Most H igh, T he Most M ighty.
W hat do the distinguished scholars, the vanguards o f the religion -Allah
be pleased with them all- say regarding a man who has been trialed with
a calamity and knows that if it continues, it shall ruin his worldly affairs
as well as his afterlife. Despite the fact he has endeavored to repel it from
himself with every means, yet it only increases in intensity and strength;
what is the method in in repelling it? And how can it be solved?
May Allah have mercy on the one who aids someone who has been
befallen with a calamity, “Allah is in aid o f His servant for as long as he
is in aid o f his brother.” 1 Provide us with a verdict, may you be
rewarded.

The Disease A n d The Cure

For Every Illness, There Is a Cure
The Shaykh and Imam, Shaykh al-Islam and grand Mufti, Shams al-DTn
Abu ‘Abdullah Muhammad bin Abu Bakr bin Ayyub, he is the leader o f
the JawzT school in the city o f Damascus -Allah be pleased with him began to answer the question as follows:
Absolute praise rightfully belongs to Allah alone. It has been
authenticated in the Sahlh o f al-Bukhari 1 on the authority o f Abu
Hurairah who narrated from the Prophet w ho said, “Allah did not decree
the descent o f any illness, except that He revealed a remedy for it.”
And in the Sahih o f Muslim,2 on the authority ofjabir bin Abdullah who
said: The Messenger o f Allah^ said: “For every illness there is a remedy,
if the remedy matches the illness, he shall be cured by the permission o f
Allah.”
In the M usnad o f Imam A hm ad,3 on the authority o f Usamah bin
Shurayk who narrated that the Prophet said: “Indeed, Allah never
decreed an illness, except that He also decreed its cure. Those who know
it, know so, and those who are ignorant o f it, are ignorant o f it.”
In another w ording4 it states: “Allah has not placed any illness without
its cure or remedy, except one illness.” They asked: “O ’ Messenger o f

The Disease A n d The Cure

Ignorance Is an Illness, and Its Remedy Is to Ask
The Prophet declared that ignorance is an illness, whilst its remedy is to
ask the scholars. Abu D aw ud1has cited in his Sunan, on the authority o f
Jabir bin Abdullah who said: “W e w ent on a journey with the Prophet
when a man was struck by a stone that left a gash on his head. Later, he
was overcome by nocturnal emission, so he enquired with his
companions by saying, ‘Do you deem that I have a concession to
perform tayam m um ?’ They replied: ‘W e do not deem that you have this
concession whilst you are able to use water.’ Thus, he bathed in water
and consequently died. W hen we approached the Messenger o f Allah
3S, he was informed o f this incident and said, “They have killed him,
Allah kill them! If only they had asked if they did not know! Surely the
cure for ignorance is to ask. It would have sufficed him to perform
tayam m um and press a bandage over his gash and wipe the water over it
and wash the remainder o f his body.”
Here he informed that ignorance is an illness, and its cure is to ask.

The Entire Q u r’an Is a Remedy
Allah has mentioned that the Q u r’an is a remedy, He said:

“And if W e had made it a non-Arabic Qur’an, they w ould have
said, ‘W h y are its verses unexplained in detail? Is it foreign yet the
M essenger is Arab?’ Say: ‘It is for those w ho believe, a guidance
and a cure.” [Fussilat:44]
He also said:

“And W e reveal from the Q ur’an w hat is a cure and a mercy for
the believers.” [al-Isra’:82]
The letter ‘m in ’ (from) in this verse defines the type and does not indicate
a reference to a part o f whatever is being mentioned, as the entire Q u r’an
is a remedy, as elaborated in the first o f the two verses above. So it is a
cure for the hearts from the illness o f ignorance, doubt and misgivings.
Thus, Allah did not reveal a cure from the heavens that is more
comprehensive, beneficial or more powerful or inclusive in eradicating
an illness than the Q ur’an.

T reatm ent in the O pening Chapter o f the
Q u r’an (al-Fatihah)
It has been authentically reported in the Sahihs o f al-Bukhari and
Muslim, 1 on the authority o f Abu Sa'ld w ho said: Some o f the
Companions o f the Prophet w ent on a journey till they reached some o f
the 'Arab tribes (at night). They asked the latter to treat them as their
guests, but they refused. The chief o f that tribe was then bitten by a
snake (or stung by a scorpion) and they tried their best to cure him but
in vain. Some o f them said, "N othing has benefited him, will you go to
the visitors who resided here at night, it may be that some o f them
possess something (as treatment)." They w ent to the group o f the
Companions and said, "Our chief has been bitten by a snake (or stung
by a scorpion) and we have tried everything, but it has not benefited.
Have you got anything (useful)?" O ne o f them replied, "Yes, by Allah!
I can recite a R uqyah, but as you have refused to accept us as your guests,
I will not recite the R uqyah for you unless you fix for us some wages for
it." They agreed to pay them a flock o f sheep. O ne o f them then w ent
and recited the opening chapter (Suratul-Fatihah): 'All the praises are for
the Lord o f the Worlds' and puffed over the chief w ho became sound as
a result, as if he was released from shackles and got up and started
walking, showing no signs o f sickness. They paid them what they
agreed to pay. Some o f the Companions then suggested dividing their

earnings am ong themselves, but the one w ho performed the recitation
said, "Do not divide them till we go to the Prophet and narrate the whole
story to him and wait for his order." So, they w ent to Allah's Messenger
and narrated the story. Allah's Messenger asked, “How did you come to
know that Suratul- Fatihah was recited as Ruqyah?” Then he added,
“You have done the right thing. Divide what you have earned and assign
a share for me as well.” As it is evident, this remedy had an effect on this
illness and eradicated it as if it never existed. It is the easiest remedy and
the least exhausting. If a servant refines the treatment through the
opening chapter, he will find it having an amazing effect as a remedy.
I spent some time in the city o f Makkah whilst frequently experiencing
illness that I could not find a doctor for nor a remedy, so I would treat
myself with the opening chapter o f the Q u r’an, and I would find that it
had an amazing effect. So I would prescribe this to those who complain
o f an ailment and many o f them would be swiftly cured1.

The Reasons for a Delay or an Absence in the
Cure
Here, there is a point that all must be conscious of, and it is that the
phrases o f remembrance, the verses and the supplications are used in the
pursuit o f a cure, or those used in ruqya are inherently beneficial and
remedial. However, they require acceptance from the place they are
applied on and a discerning strength from the one who is applying them.
So whenever the cure is delayed, it is either from a weakness in effect
that the applicant has, or a lack o f acceptance from the patient, or from
a further strong preventative that blocks the remedy from having its
effect, as is the case with the more tangible medicines. O r it could be
due to another preventative. If one’s natural form wholly accepts the
remedy, the body shall benefit from it in accordance to the extent o f this
acceptance. Likewise, if the heart wholly accepts the Ruqyah and
supplications o f refuge (in Allah) whilst the one performing the
procedure does so with full enthusiasm and discerning care, it shall have
an effect in eradicating the illness.

The Reasons for a Delay or an Absence in the
Effect o f a Supplication
The same as the aforementioned applies to a supplication. Bearing in
mind, it is from the strongest means in repelling harm and attaining the
desired objective. However, its effect can be delayed, either due to a
weakness in the supplicant in that it is a supplication that is undesirable
to Allah due to its offensive content, or a weakness in the heart and a
lack o f devotion to Allah as well as a scarcity o f presence o f heart at the
time o f supplication. Thus, becom ing like a flimsy bow that the arrow
departs from in a feeble manner. This failure to achieve a response to the
supplication occurs due to a possible prevention being present, such as
the consumption o f unlawful products, oppression, the dark cover o f sins
over the heart, an overwhelming state o f heedlessness, obliviousness or
idleness and its suppression.
As it has been collected in the Sahih o f al-H akim ,1 on the authority o f
Abu Hurairah who narrates from the Prophet: “Invoke Allah, whilst you
are sure o f a response, and know that Allah does not accept a supplication
from a heedless and distracted heart.” Also, the consumption o f anything
unlawful thwarts its strength and weakens it, as has been reported in the
Sahih o f Muslim,2 on the authority o f Abu Hurairah who said: ‘The
Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘Allah the Almighty is Good and accepts only
that which is good. And verily Allah has commanded the believers to do

“O you w ho believe! Eat o f the lawful things that W e have

Then the Prophet mentioned the case o f a man after having journeyed
far, disheveled and dusty as a result o f travel, who spreads out his hands
to the sky saying ‘O Lord! O Lord!’ while his food is haram (unlawful),
his drink is haram (unlawful), his clothing is haram (unlawful), and he
has been nourished with haram (unlawful), so how can his supplication
be answered!” Abdullah, the son o f Imam Ahmad, mentioned in the
book o f Z u h d 1 (abstinence o f the worldly life) by his father: “The
children o f IsraTl were struck by a calamity, so they came out in search
for the relief, so Allah revealed to the Prophet that he should inform
them: ‘You come out into the open plain with impure bodies, you raise
palms to me that you have used to spill blood and used to fill your homes
with unlawful things, and now that My Anger towards you has
intensified, you shall not increase in anything from Me except distance.’”

Supplication Is from the Most Beneficial
Remedies
Supplication is one o f the most beneficial remedies, it is the enemy o f
affliction, it fends it off and treats it, obstructs its befalling and uplifts it
if it descends. It is the weapon o f the believer, as al-H akim 1 has collected
in his Saluh on the authority o f Ali bin Abi Talib w ho said: ‘The
Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘Supplication is the weapon o f the believer
and the pillar o f the religion and the light o f the heavens and the earth.’”
There are three possible scenarios pertaining to supplication:
One: It is stronger than the calamity, thus, it repels it.
Two: It is weaker than the calamity, and so the calamity overpowers it
and the servant is afflicted. However, the supplication can lessen the
effect o f the calamity, even slightly.
Three: They combat each other, each cancelling out the other.
al-H akim 2 reports in his Sahlh on the authority o f Aisha who said: ‘The
Messenger o f A llah^ said to me: ‘Caution cannot evade the decree from
occurring and supplication benefits in that which has descended and that
which has not. Indeed, the calamity may befall and is met by a
supplication causing them to both struggle against one another until the
day o f resurrection.’”

A l-H akim 1 also reported on the authority o f Ibn Umar who narrated
that the Prophet said: “Supplication benefits in that which has descended
and that which has not, thus it is imperative upon you, O ’ servants o f
Allah, to supplicate.”
Also, on the authority o f Thaw ban2: “Decree is not repelled by anything
other than supplication, none other than righteousness can increase
lifespan, and certainly a man can be denied some provisions due to a sin
he perpetrates.”

Persistence in Supplication
Amongst the most useful remedies is persistence in supplication. Ibn
M ajah1has collected a narration in his Sutiati on the authority o f Abu
Hurairah who said: “The Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘W hoever does not
ask Allah, He [Allah] becomes angry at him ’”. Also, in the Sahih o f alH akim 2 on the authority o f Anas w ho narrated from the Prophet said:
“Do not fail to supplicate, as it is certain that none shall be doomed with
supplication.”
Al-Awza’i also narrates from Az-ZuhrT who narrates on the authority o f
Aisha who said: ‘The Messenger o f A llah^ said: ‘Indeed, Allah loves
those who are persistent in supplication.’”
In the book o f Zuhd (worldly abstinence) by Imam Ahmad2, on the
authority o f Qatada who said: “Muwaraq said: i have been unable to
find a similitude o f the believer other than a man who is adrift at sea on
a piece o f wood, as he calls out ‘My Lord, My Lord!’ In the hope that
Allah saves him .’”

Obstacles That Stand in the W ay o f a Response
From the obstacles that prevent the effect o f a supplication taking place
is the hastiness o f the supplicant and his view that the response is long
overdue. Thus, he despairs and quits any further supplication. He is
equivalent to the one who sows a seed or plants some vegetation before
taking care o f it and watering it; however, when he deems the complete
fruition and fullness to be overdue, he discards it and disregards it!
In the Saliih o f al-B ukhari1 on the authority of Abu Hurairah who
narrated that the Prophet said: “You shall be responded to as long as you
are not hasty, to say: ‘I supplicated, but I am yet to be answered.’”
In the Saliih o f Muslim2 also on the authority o f Abu Hurairah: “The
supplication o f a slave continues to be granted as long as he does not
supplicate for a sinful thing, or for something that would cut off the ties
o f kinship and does not grow impatient.” It was said: "O Messenger of
Allah M W hat does grow ing impatient mean?" He said, “It is one's
saying: 'I supplicated again and again but I do not think that my prayer
will be answered.' Then he becomes frustrated and gives up supplication
altogether.”
In the M usnad o f Imam Ahmad' on the authority o f Anas who said: “The
Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘The servant will not cease to be upon good

as long as he is not impetuous.’ They asked: ‘O Messenger o f Allah 365,
what does it mean to be impetuous?’ He responded: ‘To say: ‘1 have

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Conditions for the Acceptance o f a
Supplication
If the supplication is combined with a complete presence and
consciousness o f heart for the objective and meets with the six prescribed
times o f a response - and they are: The last third o f the night, at the time
o f the call to prayer, between the call to prayer and the second call to
perform the prayer, immediately upon completion o f the five obligatory
prayers, from the mom ent the Imam ascends to deliver the sermon on
Friday till the establishment o f the prayer and the final hour on Friday
after the afternoon prayer. N ow, if this is matched with the awe in the
heart and a dire sense o f need before your Lord, a sense o f insignificance,
an earnest plead to Him and a weakness in being without His aid whilst
facing the direction o f prayer, being in a state o f purity, raising the hands
upwards towards Allah The Most High, beginning the supplication with
praises and glorification o f Allah before coupling this with sending the
blessings and salutations upon M uham m ad^ the Messenger and His
servant, then offering repentance, seeking forgiveness before addressing
Allah and being persistent in the request, adulating Him whilst invoking
Him in hope and fear, interceding with His Oneness and Perfect Names
and Attributes and offering an act o f charity- if this is all performed, it
would be a supplication that would seldom be rejected, especially if it
corresponds with the supplications that the Prophet has informed us o f
that are most likely answered and those that contain The Great Name
o f Allah.

21

The Disease A n d The Cure

Supplications That Are Most Likely Answered
From this is the narration that has been collected by the four compilers
o f the Sunan and by Ibn Hibban on the authority o f Abdullah bin
Buraydah who narrated from his father who said: “The Messenger o f
Allah^ heard a man say: ‘O Allah! I ask you by virtue that 1 testify that
you are Allah; there is no deity worthy o f worship except You, The One,
The Self-Sufficient Master, W ho did not beget, and was not begotten,
and to whom no one is equal.’ Allah’s Messenger then said, ‘He has asked
Allah by His Name by which when asked, He gives, and by which when
supplicated, He answers1.”’ In another wording, it states: “You have
asked Allah by His greatest N am e2.”
Also in the four Sunan and Ibn Hibban is a narration on the authority o f
Anas bin Malik wherein he was seated with the Messenger o f Allah^
whilst a man was praying, the man supplicated by saying: “O Allah! I
ask You by virtue o f the fact that all praise is due to You; none has the
right to be worshiped but You alone, and You have no partner nor
associate, the Bestower, the O riginator o f the heavens and the earth, the
Possessor o f Majesty and H onor.” The Prophet then said: “He has asked
Allah by His Greatest Name which, if He is asked thereby He gives and
if He is called upon thereby He answers.”’

others for their gain. He would travel to distant horizons, and he was an
avid worshipper and a pious person. O n one occasion, he w ent on a
journey and came into contact with a thief who was draped in
weaponry. The thief said to him, ‘Give me what you have, for I will kill

you.’ He replied, ‘W hat do you want with my blood? Your desire is to
have my wealth.’ The thief said, ‘As for your wealth, then it is mine, and
I still want to spill your blood.’ He said, ‘In which case, I refuse to hand
it to you, but allow me to pray four units o f prayer first.’ The thief
replied, ‘As you wish.’ So he performed ablution and prayed four units.
Part o f his supplication in the final prostration was: “O ’ W adud, O wner
o f the Mighty Throne, The O ne who does as He pleases, I beseech You
by Your Might that is undisputable, Your Reign that is undeniable and
by Your light that fills all sides o f Your Throne to spare me from the evil
o f this thief. O ’ M uglth aid me! O MugTth aid me [three times].’ At
which point, a horseman approached with a spear in his hand that he
had rested in between the ears o f his horse aimed at the thief. W hen the
thief saw him, he turned towards him, but was struck by the spear and
died. Then the horseman turned towards him and said, “Get up.” So he
enquired ‘W ho are you, may my mother and father be sacrificed for
you? Allah has relieved me today through you.’ The man replied, ‘I am
an angel from the fourth heaven, you made your first supplication and I
heard a noise at the gates o f the heavens, then you made your second
supplication and 1 heard a noise from the occupants o f the heavens, then
you made your third supplication, and it was said to me: ‘This is the
supplication o f one in distress.’ So I asked Allah to assign me this task.’”
Al-Hassan then said: “So whoever performs ablution, prays four units
and supplicates with this invocation, he shall be responded to whether
he is in distress or otherwise.”

A Supplication Can Be Answered Because it
Meets a Particular Condition, and N ot Due to a
Secret Phrase
Many times, you find that people will make a supplication and it is
answered. This supplication could have corresponded with the
supplicant’s dire need, devotion to Allah or a previous good deed he
performed that caused a response from Allah as an act o f gratitude for
the good deed. O r it could have corresponded with a time wherein the
supplication is sure to be answered, thus it was answered. So one may
think that the secret is in the w ording o f the supplication itself, which
leads someone to perform the supplication with the exclusion o f the
aforementioned reasons that it is coupled with relating to the supplicant.
This is equal to a scenario in which someone takes some medicine at the
most appropriate time in the most appropriate manner, thus benefiting
from it whilst others deem that merely taking the medicine w ithout the
connected factors is sufficient in attaining the objective. He is mistaken,
and it is an issue that many people have erred in.
An example o f this is that someone could make a supplication in dire
need but happen to be at a gravesite and is answered, so the ignorant
one will think that the secret defining factor is the grave, whilst he fails
to realize that the secret is in his need and truthful devotion to Allah, yet
bearing in mind that if this takes place in a house from the houses o f
Allah (mosques), it is better.

Supplication Is a W eapon Defined by the User,
N ot Solely by its Characteristic
Supplications and the various forms o f seeking refuge are like a weapon,
and the weapon is determined by the user and not solely on its sharpness.
Thus, whenever the weapon is w ithout defect whilst the user is strong
and the preventative barriers are absent, the enemy is defeated.
However, whenever one o f these factors is missing, the effect becomes
absent. So if the supplication in itself is inappropriate, or the person
supplicating has not actualized the harmony and presence between his
heart and tongue in the supplication or there is a further underlying
prevention from achieving a response, the effect is not realized.

The Relationship Between the Supplication and
the Divine Decree
This is a common question; it pertains to the subject o f the supplication
and the need for it. If it has already been decreed, it must come to pass
whether an individual supplicates for it or not. O n the other hand, if it
has not been decreed, it will never come to pass whether an individual
supplicates for it or not.
A (misguided) group has taken the belief that this is a viable question,
thus they quit all supplication and said: “There is no any benefit in it!”
Such people -along with their exceedingly great am ount o f ignorancecontradict themselves, as applying their methodology would necessitate
an annulment o f all means that lead to an objective.
It should be said to them: If the sense o f satisfaction from food and the
quenching o f thirst has been decreed, it must inevitably take place
whether you eat or not. Likewise, if it has not been decreed, it will not
happen, whether you consume or not.
In addition, if it has been decreed that you are to conceive a child, it
must happen whether you perform intercourse with your wife or not.
But if it has not been decreed, then there is no need for marriage or
taking a concubine and so on and so forth.
Can it then be said that this is the reasoning o f a sane person or a human?
In fact, the beastly animals are naturally inclined to undertake particular
means in order to maintain themselves and their lives. Thus, animals are
more discerning and understanding than the aforementioned group
w ho resemble the animals, or they are in fact more astray.

33

The Disease A n d The Cure

Some others have feigned intelligence and said: “O ccupying oneself
with supplication is an absolute act o f worship unconnected to anything
else that Allah will reward the supplicant for w ithout there being any
effect or outcome regarding the sought after objective in any capacity.”
From the perspective o f this feigner o f intelligence, there lies no
difference between performing a supplication and withholding from it
with his heart and tongue as far as it concerns the effect in attaining the
objective and that the connection with a supplication is equivalent to
the connection to silence - in their view - w ithout difference.
Another group who is better at feigning intellect than the previous
group declared: “That the supplication is merely a sign that Allah has
placed in order to signify the decree o f a particular action.” So whenever
a servant has been granted the success to perform a supplication, it stands
as a sign and a symbol that their affair has been fulfilled. Such as the dark
and cold clouds that we see during the winter season, they exist as a
proof and a sign that it will rain.
They continued to say: “This is also the ruling with the acts o f obedience
in relation to the reward and the disbelief and sins in relation to the
punishment. They are only symbols that indicate the reward or the
punishment, not that they are a means to the recompense.’ In their belief,
the same applies to breakages and the break, burning and being burnt,
dying and death. All o f which are neither means that cause the outcome
nor do they possess any connection with one another apart from the
ordinary occurrence in that they take place together. N ot the process o f
cause and effect.
All o f the above have conflicted with the natural senses, sound intellect,
the correct legislation, the natural inclination and the other groups who
exercise their intellect. In fact, they have become the laughing stock o f
all the intellectuals!

34

The Disease A n d The Cure

The correct stance is that there is a third category that has not been
mentioned by the questioner. It is that the decreed event has been
realized through a cause, and from its causes is supplication. It did not
happen without a cause; rather, it had a cause. Therefore, whenever the
servant fulfills the cause, the decreed objective shall come to pass and the
opposite is also correct. This is the same as the sense o f hunger and thirst
being alleviated through food and drink, the conception o f a child
through intercourse, grow ing plants through the sowing if seeds and
the death o f an animal through its slaughter. Also, admittance into
Paradise is through actions and so is the admittance into the Hellfire.
This is the correct category, and it is the one that the questioner has been
denied from know ing and not guided to.

35

The Disease A n d The Cure

Supplication Is a Powerful Means
Supplication is amongst the strongest means. If the object that is being
supplicated for comes to pass, it would not be correct to say, “There is
no benefit in supplicating,” as it is not correct to say: “There is no benefit
in eating, drinking or any movement or action!” There is no other cause
more beneficial or profound than performing a supplication in attaining
the objective.
Since the Companions are the most knowledgeable people in this nation
about Allah and His Messenger and those who held the most astute
understanding, it is only appropriate that they were the most
accomplished in im plementing this means, its conditions and its
mannerisms than anyone else. Umar bin al-Khattab would seek to
triumph over his enemies with it and it proved to be his mightiest force.
He would say to his companions: “You are not granted victory due to
your large numbers. Instead, you are granted victory from above the
heavens.”
He would also say: “I do not worry about the response, rather I worry
about making the supplication. If I have been inspired to supplicate, then
surely the response comes with it.”
A poet carried this meaning and composed it in a line o f poetry, he said:
// you did not want to give me what I hope and ash for — from your
generous hand, you would not have made me accustomed to ask

So whoever has been moved to perform a supplication then it is
inevitable that a response has been desired for him. Allah says:

And in the Suttati o f Ibn Majah on the authority o f Abu Hurairah who
said: “The Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘W hoever does not ask Allah, He
[Allah] becomes angry at h im 1.” All this is evident o f the fact that Allah’s
pleasure is sought through asking and obeying Him. If The Lord is
pleased with you, in that is everything that is good in contrast to His
displeasure wherein lies every calamity and tragedy. Al-Imam Ahmad
recorded a (Q udsi ) narration in the book o f Z n lid (worldly abstinence)

Moreover, it has been identified through sound intellect and text, natural

cultures, faiths and creeds- that a devotion to The Lord o f creation and
the pursuit o f His Pleasure, Righteousness and Benevolence to His
creation are all from the most powerful means o f attaining all that is
good, and their opposite actions are the greatest reasons that entice all
that is evil. There has never been anything as significant in achieving

In His Book, Allah has arranged that anything that is good or bad in this
world and the Hereafter be attained in accordance to actions. This
applies to the recompense being in accordance to the meeting o f the
condition, the reason and the outcome and the cause and the effect.

The Disease A n d The Cure

In summary, the Q u r’an from beginning to end clearly defines that the
recompense for evil and good and the universal occurrences have a
reason, in fact, the judgm ents in the worldly life and the Hereafter as
well as their harms and benefits are all in accordance to their causes and
particular actions. Therefore, whoever truly understands this point and
considers it thoroughly, will benefit from it immensely and not
ignorantly and erroneously depend on the Divine Decree as an excuse
for his inability, neglect and squandering o f affairs which will only
equate to a reversal o f affairs in that his reliance will amass to non-action,
and his non-action will be his method o f reliance.
Rather, the knowledgeable one will refer the Divine Decree to other
decreed matters and explain it in the same manner. As a matter o f fact,
it is not possible to live any other way. Hunger, thirst, cold and other
dangers and cautionary things are from the Divine Decree, and the
entire creation endeavors to repel such decreed matters with other acts
that have also been decreed.
This is how it would appear to the one who has been granted success by
Allah and guided. He would repel the decreed punishment in the
Hereafter with the decreed act o f repentance, correct faith and righteous
actions. This is the scale o f the undesirable Divine Decree (punishments
etc.), and the opposite is also correct. As the Lord o f both realms is One,
His W isdom is perfect and one and is not contradictory nor does it
disaffirm itself.

47

The Disease A n d The Cure

However, T w o Matters Have Yet To Be
M entioned. T hrough Them , O ne Can Attain
Complete Happiness and Success.
The first: To know the details o f evil and good whilst possessing insight
into that gained by the observations one makes o f the world, personal
experiences and whatever he has heard about previous and current
civilizations. The most beneficial way to execute this is by thoroughly
contemplating the Q u r’an, because it contains this information in the
most complete manner and contains all the reasons for evil and good in
detail and precision. The Q u r’an is followed by the Sunnah (Prophetic
way). It is its counterpart and the second revelation. Thus, whoever
dedicates their concern to them both shall be sufficed with them over all
else, as they will both portray the good and evil along with their causes,
as if you are literally observing it.
After this sequence o f observations, if you were to ponder over the news
about the nations throughout time, and the significant days o f Allah that
the people o f obedience and disobedience experienced, whilst
corresponding this to the knowledge you have learnt from the Q ur’an
and the Sunnah, and having come across the details that Allah has
outlined and promised, and you know His signs that He has set in the
horizons, you will come to realize that the Q u r’an is the truth, the
Messenger is a true Messenger and that Allah will fulfill His promise
w ithout fail. This is because history is a detailed account to some aspects
that Allah and His Messenger have informed us o f in relation to the
overall causes for good and evil.

49

The Disease A n d The Cure

The second: To beware o f misleading yourself in your implementation
o f the causes. This is from the most important matters. The servant will
unavoidably know that sins and heedlessness are from the causes for
harm in his own worldly affairs and his Hereafter. Yet his soul may
mislead itself in erroneously depending on the pardon and forgiveness
o f Allah at times, procrastination at times, uttering a superficial word
that only has an effect on the tongue to seek forgiveness at times,
performing permissible actions at times, gaining some knowledge at
times, falsely using the excuse o f the Divine Decree at times and
excusing oneself by the actions o f his peers and following those greater
in stature than him at other times.
Many people assume that they can perpetrate whatever they want before
saying ‘I ask for forgiveness’ and all effects o f the sin will be eradicated!
A man who (falsely) ascribes himself to knowledge once said to me: “I
do as I please, then 1 say: ‘Subhan Allah W a Bi Hamdihi’ one hundred
times, and all o f my sins shall be forgiven, as it has been authentically
reported from the Prophet who said: ‘W hoever says in a day ‘Subhan
Allah W a Bi Hamdihi’ one hundred times, his misdeeds will be pardoned
even if they amounted to the foam o f the sea.’”1
Another man from the people o f Makkah said to me: “if any one o f us
performs a sin, regardless o f its proportion, he would bathe and
circumambulate around the Ka'bah seven times and it would be wiped
from him .”
Another individual said to me: “It has been authentically reported from
the Prophet that he said: ‘A servant committed a sin and then said, 'O
my Lord! I have sinned, please forgive me!' thus, he is forgiven. Then he

remains without com mitting any sin for a while and then again commits
another sin and says, 'O my Lord, I have committed another sin, please
forgive me,' thus, he is forgiven. Then he remains w ithout com mitting
another sin for a while and then commits another sin and says, 'O my
Lord, I have committed another sin, please forgive me,' and Allah says,
'My slave has known that he has a Lord W ho forgives sins and punishes
for it, I therefore have forgiven My slave, he can do as he wills.’”' He
continued to say, “I do not have any doubt that 1 have a Lord W ho
forgives the sins and punishes for them .”
This particular category o f people has clung onto the texts about having
hope and has relied on them and has attached onto them with both
hands. If he is admonished for a mistake and being engrossed into it, he
begins to recount all that he has memorized pertaining to the limitless
Mercy and Forgiveness o f Allah from the words o f hope.
The ignoramuses who are part o f this category o f people have
mentioned strange and peculiar statements, such as:
Increase in whatever you can o f mistakes — If you will arrive to O ne W ho is
Generous

Another o f them said: “Purifying oneself from sin is ignorance o f the
limitless o f Allah’s Pardon.”
Another one said: “Abandoning sin is audacity in the face o f the
Forgiveness o f Allah and a belittlement o f it!”
Abu Muhammad Ibn Hazm said: “I have witnessed some o f them say:
‘Allah, I seek refuge in You from infallibility.’”

From amongst these deluded individuals are those who cling onto the
doctrine o f Jabr, which is the belief that a servant does not have any free
will to act or any choice; instead, he is compelled to commit
disobedience. Also, from them are those who are deceived by the
doctrine o f Irja’ in that faith is comprised o f a mere attestation whilst
actions are excluded from faith and the faith o f an immoral person
equates to the faith o f angels(s) Jibrll and Mika’ll.
Additionally, from them, are those who are deceived by their love for
the ‘ascetics’, the ‘scholars’ and the ‘righteous’. They frequent their
gravesites, plead to them, seek their intercession and seek that they are
intermediaries between himself and Allah and asks Allah by their right
and holiness.
From them also are those who are deceived into believing that their
forefathers and predecessors maintain a high status with Allah and are
from the special ones. Thus, they will not beseech Him for relief, just as
it is the case in the presence o f the kings in the worldly life. The kings
in the worldly life have their nearest entourage intervene to seek a
pardon for the wrongs o f their children or relatives, and if any o f them
commit a heinous deed, their father or grandfather rescues them using
their status.
Some others are deceived by the fact that Allah is not in need o f
delivering a punishment in the least, and that exercising His Punishment
does not enrich His Sovereignty, and bestowing His Mercy does not
decrease anything from His Sovereignty. So this individual will say: ‘1
am in dire need o f His Mercy, and He is Has absolute ownership o f
everything, if a poor and destitute person were in dire need o f a drink
o f water in the presence o f someone who owns a house with a running
river, he would not deny him a drink. Well, Allah is more Generous and
Giving than that, Forgiving someone does not decrease Him in the

52

The Disease A n d The Cure

slightest and delivering a punishment does not increase His sovereignty
in the slightest.
Also, from them are those who have been deluded by an erroneous
understanding that he and his likes have mistakenly extracted from the
Q ur an and the Sunnah. So they completely relied on it. An example of
which is their reliance on the statement o f Allah in addressing the
Messenger:

“And your Lord is g o in g to give you, and you w ill be satisfied.”
[Ad-Duha:5]
They say: The Messenger will not be satisfied if anyone from his nation
is in the Hellfire. This is a form o f the most extreme ignorance and
clearest o f lies, as he is pleased with whatever his Lord is pleased with,
and Allah is pleased that the oppressors, corrupt ones, dishonest ones and
those who are persistent upon major sins are punished. Far removed is
His Messenger from ever being displeased with something that his Lord
is pleased with. Also, their reliance on the statement o f Allah:
E

,> *

,

- „ j

“Indeed, Allah forgives all sins.” [Az-Zumar:53]
This form o f reliance is also from the worst cases o f ignorance, as
polytheism is included in this instance whilst it is the greatest sin and the
origin o f all sin. However, there is no disagreement that this verse refers
to the repentant ones because Allah will forgive every sin for the one
who repents, regardless o f its nature. If this verse was not in reference to
the repentant ones, all the texts o f punishment would become null and
void along with the narrations that prove that a group o f people amongst

53

The Disease A n d The Cure

the monotheists shall be removed from the Hellfire through an
intercession. This belief has crept into the individual due to his own lack
o f knowledge and understanding, because Allah generalized in the
aforementioned verse, so it was known that he intended those who
repent. However, in the chapter o f A n -N is a ’, He specified and restricted
it, He said:

“Indeed, Allah does not forgive that you set partners w ith Him
[unless it is repented from before death], and He forgives anything
lesser than that to w hom soever He w ills.” [A n-N isa’:48]
Here, Allah informs that He does not forgive polytheism yet forgives
anything lesser than that. But if this verse were in reference to the one
who has repented, there would not be a difference between the sin o f
polytheism and all other sins (because Allah accepts the repentance from
polytheism).
Also, such as the delusion o f some o f the ignorant ones from the
statement o f Allah:
GpO&’l d p t

li f t

“O ’ m ankind, what has deluded you in respects to your N oble
Lord?” [al-Infitar:6]
He will respond: “His generosity!” Others may say: “The deceived one
has been informed o f his excuse for the sins.” Undoubtedly, this is
extreme ignorance. In fact, the chief deceiver -Satan- and the person’s
soul that commands with evil along with his own ignorance and whims
have deceived him.

54

Allah revealed the verse with the w ord ‘Karim’ (Noble), whilst He is the
Supreme Master and obeyed O ne W hom a person can never be deluded
about nor can one ever neglect His rights. Therefore, the deluded one
has become deceived about the O ne W hom it is unbefitting to ever be
deceived about.
Also, such as the delusion o f some o f them as it pertains to the statement
of Allah about the Hellfire:

Yet this deceived individual failed to realize that the statement o f Allah:

“I have warned you o f a fire that is blazing.” [al-Layl:14]
(The previous verse) is in reference to a specific fire in the depths o f the
Hellfire.
If it (verse 15-16) were in reference to the entire Hellfire, He would
have said (None shall enter it), but instead He said “N one w ill reach
therein.” N ot reaching a particular place does not necessitate not
entering it in totality, as reaching a place is more specific than an
entrance into a place, and negating what is more specific does not
necessitate a negation o f it all.
55

In addition, if this deluded individual were to ponder over the
succeeding verse, he would come to know it would not refer to him,
thus it would not be in his capacity to avoid it.
As for the other statement about the Hellfire:

“prepared for the disbelievers,” [al-Baqarah:24]
Then He has also mentioned the same about Paradise:

“prepared for the pious.” [al- Imran:133]
This preparation oi the Hellfire for the disbelievers does not nullify the
possibility o f the immoral and oppressive ones also entering it, whilst the
preparation of Paradise for the pious does not negate the possibility o f it
being entered by someone with the most miniscule amount o f faith and
the one who never performed any good.
Also, such as the reliance o f some o f them in performing the fast of
A sh u ra 1 or ‘Araja2, to the extent some of them will say: “Fasting the day
o f Ashura will expiate the sins o f the entire year and fasting the day o f
‘Arafa will be an extra reward.” But this deluded individual is not aware
that fasting the m onth o f Ramadan and establishing the five daily prayers
is greater and more highly regarded than fasting the days o f Ashura and
'Arafa, whilst these actions expiate the sins that are performed in
between on the condition that the major sins have been avoided.

The succession o f fasting each m onth o f Ramadan after the other and
establishing the Friday prayers does not am ount to enough o f a means
to expiate the minor sins unless these actions are coupled with the
abandonment o f the major sins. Thus, collectively they are strong
enough o f a means to expiate the m inor sins. So how can performing a
voluntary fast o f one day be enough o f a means to expiate every major
sin that the servant has perpetrated whilst he is still persistent upon it and
non-repentant? This is an impossibility, even though it is viable that
fasting the day o f'A r a fa and the Day o f Ashura is a general expiation to
the sins o f that particular year and that this information is from the words
o f good promise that apply with conditions. However, a persistent
indulgence in major sins is an impediment to this expiation being
fulfilled. So if- he ceases to persist in perpetrating major sins, the fasting
o f those days and his lack o f persistence will both aid one another in the
overall expiation, just as fasting the m onth o f Ramadan and establishing
the five daily prayers along with not performing the major sins are all
reasons that aid one another in expiating the minor sins, bearing in mind
Allah has stated:

“If you avoid the major sins w hich you are forbidden, W e will
remove from you your lesser sins.” [A n-N isa’:3l]
Through this, one will know that having a particular means for
expiation does not inhibit the possibility o f another means supporting it
in the expiation o f sins; consequently making the expiation that takes
place via a combination o f the two means is stronger and more complete
than isolating only one means, and the stronger the means for an
expiation are, the stronger and more comprehensive and complete the
expiation becomes.

A Good T hought About the Lord Can O nly
Happen W ith Obedience
Undeniably, good thoughts rightfully occur when there are good
actions. The good doer has adopted good thoughts about his Lord that
He will reward him for his good, not betray His promise and accept his
repentance. As for the evildoer and the one persistent in perpetrating
major sins, oppression and defiance, the despondency that he attains
from sins and oppression and criminality will prevent him from
adopting good thoughts about his Lord. This is a reality that is being
witnessed. The absconding evildoer who has left the obedience o f his
Master will not hold a good thought about Him, and the despondency
o f w rong can never be matched alongside good thoughts. Surely, the
evildoer is as despondent as his degree o f evil, and the best o f those who
have good thoughts about their Lord are those who are most obedient
to Him, as al-Hasan al-Basri mentioned: “The believer refined his
thoughts about his Lord, consequently he refined his actions. But the
immoral one spoiled his thoughts o f his Lord, consequently he spoiled
his actions.”
H ow can one have good thoughts about his Lord whilst he is fleeing
from Him, indulgent in the things that anger Him, exposed and
subjected to His curse, has deemed that the right and commands o f his
Lord are insignificant and squandered them whilst his Lord’s
prohibitions he has taken lightly and decided to violate them and persist
upon that!?
H ow can someone who wages an open war with his Lord, have enmity
to His allies, ally with His adversaries, deny His perfect Attributes, hold

59

an erroneous belief in the Attributes that He and His Messengers have
ascribed to Him whilst deeming that all o f the news that has reached us
o f that is misguidance and disbelief ever have a good thought o f Him.
How can one who believes the Lord does not speak, nor command, nor
prohibit, nor become pleased or becomes angry ever have a good
thought about Him?
Allah has stated the condition o f those who have the slightest doubt in
His Ability to Hear minute details in the statement:

“And that was your assumption that you assumed about your Lord.

These people in question, when they assumed that Allah does not know
much o f what they do, it was considered as having bad thoughts about
their Lord, thus, it brought them to ruin. And this is the case with
anyone who denies Allah’s perfect Attributes or describes Him in a
manner unbefitting to His Majesty. If this person believes that this belief
will admit him into Paradise, he has fallen victim to delusion, selfdeception and an allurement by Satan. It certainly is not good thoughts
about his Lord.

So Contemplate O ver This, and Reflect Over
the Dire Need For H aving Good Thoughts!
How can it be that the heart harmonizes between the certitude that he
will inevitably meet his Lord, He hears his words, sees his whereabouts,
knows his secret affairs and the public ones, nothing is ever concealed
from Him and that he will be made to stand before His Lord to be held
to account for all o f what he has done, whilst he chooses to partake in
the things that anger His Lord, whilst he squanders the Lords commands
and denies His rights? All this and he believes he has good thoughts
about his Lord? Is this anything other than a self-deception and
delusional false hope?
Abu Umamah bin Sahl bin H unayf mentioned: “Urwah bin Az-Zubayr
and I entered to ‘Aisha and she said: ‘If you had seen the Messenger o f
Allah®® during one o f his illnesses when I only possessed six or -sevendinars', yet the Messenger o f Allah^ instructed me to distribute them .’
She further w ent on to say: ‘However, I became busy in tending to his
needs during his pain until he was cured by Allah. He then asked me:
‘W hat did you do? Did you distribute the six dinars?’ I replied: ‘No, by
Allah I was busied with your illness.’ So she said: ‘He asked for the
money, placed it in his hand and said: ‘W hat would M uham m ad^ be
thinking if he met Allah whilst these were still in his possession?”’2 In
another wording: “W hat would the Prophet o f Allah be thinking if he
met Allah whilst these were still in his possession?”

W hat would the perpetrators o f major sins and oppression be thinking
about Allah when they meet Him whilst they have wronged the people?
If their claim o f “W e thought well o f our Lord” held any substance to it,
there would not be a single tyrant or sinful person punished. In which
case, he can do as he pleases, and partake in all that Allah has prohibited
him from as long as he thinks well o f Allah, the fire shall not touch him!
Subhan A llah! See what deception can do to a servant!
Prophet Ibrahim said to his people:

“Is it falsehood as gods other than Allah you desire?!” [AsSaffat:86-87]
i.e., how do you think He will deal with you when you meet Him
having worshipped other than Him?

Good Thoughts About Allah Are Essential
Alongside Perform ing Good Actions
W hoever thoroughly contemplates over the aforementioned shall come
to know that having good thoughts about Allah happens with
performing good actions. Undeniably, the servant is drawn to good
actions by his good thoughts about his Lord in that He shall recompense
him for his actions, reward him for them and accept them from him.
The driving factor that led him to good actions was the good thoughts,
and the more his thoughts excel, the better his actions become. O n the
other hand, good thoughts alongside an adherence to whims and desires
are a defective weakness. As has been reported in A t-Tirm idhl and the
M usnad o f al-Imam Ahmad in a narration on the authority o f Shaddad
bin Aws who reported from the Prophet who said: “The astute one is he
w ho holds himself to account and performs actions for the life after
death. As for the helpless one, he is someone who allows his soul to
follow its desires and has a false hope in Allah.”1
In summary, good thoughts can only be actualized when attached to the
means o f success. As for the reasons o f destruction, they can never result
in good thoughts. If it is said: “No, rather is it possible, as good thoughts
can be based on the expansive forgiveness o f Allah, His Mercy, Pardon
and Generosity, and that his Mercy has overtaken His Anger and that
inflicting a punishment will not benefit Him nor will His Pardon harm
him ,” it could also be said: “The matter is as you have said, and Allah is
even far more elevated than that and more Noble and Generous.

However, this should be understood appropriately, as He is attributed to
having perfect Wisdom, Honor, Reprisal and severe punishment and
reprimanding those who deserve to be reprimanded, if he made a
determination to have good thoughts strictly based on the Lord’s Names
and Attributes, then the righteous and the immoral and the believer and
the disbeliever would be united. How could the criminal possibly be
aided by His Names and Attributes if he is drawn into the actions that
anger Him and bring about His resentment, become exposed to sins,
delved into His prohibitions and violate His boundaries? O n the
contrary, having good thoughts will benefit those who repent, regret
and renounce their misdeeds, perform a righteous deed in place o f an
evil one and approach the remainder o f their life with goodness and
obedience, and then enhance their good thoughts. The latter is good
thoughts, and the first is deception! Allah’s Aid is sought.
So do not deem that this segment has been too long, because the need
for it is dire. Note that there is a difference between having good
thoughts about Allah, and between being deceived.

Narrations That Should D eter the Ignorant and
Deluded Sinner, by the Mercy o f Allah
Many ignorant people have inappropriately relied on the Mercy, Pardon
and Generosity o f Allah and squandered His orders, prohibitions and
forgot that He is severe in punishment and that His punishment cannot
be repelled from those who are criminals. But whoever relies on His
Pardon whilst he is insistent upon sins is like the stubborn one.
M a’ruf said: “Your hope for mercy from one whom you do not obey is
delusion and feeblemindedness.”
Some o f the scholars have also said: “W hoever takes a limb from you in
this worldly life as a penalty for theft o f something worth three dirlmms,
do not fall into a false sense o f security that His punishment in the
Hereafter with be similar.”
It was said to al-Hasan: “W e see that you cry a lot!” He replied: “I fear
that He will cast me into the fire w ithout consideration.”
A man asked al-Hasan and said: “O Abu Sa id, what are we to do when
we sit in a gathering with people who strike a fear into us to the extent
our hearts feel like escaping?” He replied: “By Allah, for you to
accompany people who strike this fear into you until you attain safety
and security from the punishment is better than accompanying a people
who assure you with a false sense o f security until you reach the dangers

Also in the M usnad o f al-Imam A hm ad1 on the authority o f Hudhayfah
who said: “W e were with the Messenger o f A llah^ during a funeral
procession. W hen we reached the actual grave, he sat at its edge and
would repeatedly look at the grave, then he said: ‘The believer will be
squeezed once in it until his organs intertwine, and it will fill up with
fire for the disbeliever.’”
Also in the M usnad o f al-Imam Ahmad2 on the authority o fja b ir who
said: “W e w ent out with the Messenger o f Allah^ to perform the funeral
o f Sa d bin Mu adh. W hen the Messenger o f Allah^S prayed over him
and he was placed in his grave and it was leveled. The Messenger o f

made takbir, so we did the same. It was then said: “W hy did you make
tasbih and then takbir ?” He replied: (The grave o f this pious servant was
squeezed until Allah eventually relieved him).

Also in the Musnad o f al-Imam Ahmad 1 on the authority o f Abu
Umamah who said: “The Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘O n the Day o f

The people will sweat in accordance to their misdeeds, from them are
those whose sweat will reach their ankles, from them are those whose
sweat will reach their shins, from them are those whose sweat will reach

Also in the M usnad o f al-Imam Ahmad2 as has been reported by Ibn
‘Abbas who narrated from the Prophet who said: “How can I bask in the

Also collected in the Sahihs o f al-Bukhari and Muslim2 on the authority

In the M usnad' o f al-Imam Ahmad on the authority o f Ibn ‘Umar, he
said: “W hoever purchases a garment for as little as ten dirhams and one
o f those dirhams has been earned unlawfully, Allah will not accept his
prayers as long as he has it.” He then placed his fingers in his ears and
said: “May I be deafened if I had not heard it directly from the Prophet.”
Also in the M usnad o f al-Imam Ahmad2 is a narration on the authority
o f Abdullah bin Amr who narrated from the Prophet: “W hoever
abandons the prayer once due to intoxication, it is as if he possessed the
world and let it escape from him. And whoever abandons the prayer
four times, Allah would make it His right that he makes them drink from
Tinat al-K habal.” It was said: “W hat is Tinat al-K habal O ’ Messenger o f

Also, al-Imam Ahmad1 collected a narration that has been attributed to
the Prophet on the authority o f Abdullah bin Amr: “W hoever takes one
drink o f an intoxicant, Allah shall not accept his prayers for forty days,
but if he repents, Allah will accept his repentance. However, if he re­
offends, Allah will not accept his prayers for forty days and if he repents,
Allah will accept his repentance. I am unsure whether he said it on the
third or fourth occasion, he said: If they re-offend again, Allah would
make it His right that he makes him drink from Tinat al-Khabal on the
Day o f Resurrection.”

said: ‘W hat is the river o f G luita?’ He replied: ‘A river that flows out o f

Also in the M ustiad o f al-Imam Ahmad2 on the authority o f Abu Musa

before Allah three times on the Day o f Resurrection. The first two times
will be for disputes and excuses, and the third time will be when the
scrolls o f deeds fly into their hands, some will take it in the right hand
and some in the left.’”
Also in the M ustiad o f al-Imam Ahmad3 on the authority o f Ibn Mas ud:
“The Messenger o f AllafnS said: ‘Beware o f the sins that people deem
insignificant, for indeed they accumulate against an individual until they
destroy him .’ The Messenger o f Allah*! struck a parable. It was o f a

and over that bridge there will be hooks similar to the thorns o f AsSa'dan (a thorny tree). These hooks will snatch the people according to
their deeds. Some people will be ruined because o f their evil deeds, and
some will be cut into pieces and fall down in Hell but will be saved
afterwards when Allah has finished the judgm ents among His slaves and
intends to take out o f the Fire whoever He wishes to take out from
among those who used to testify that none has the right to be
worshipped but Allah. W e will order the Angels to take them out and
the angels will know them by the traces o f the mark o f prostration (on
their foreheads) for Allah banned the Fire from consuming the traces of
prostration on the body o f Adam's son. So they will take them out, and
by then they would have burnt (as coal), and then water, called M a'ul

In another wording it states: ‘These are the first amongst the creation o f

I heard Shaykh al-Islam Ibn TaymTyah say: “Just as the best o f creation
are the Prophets, the worst o f them are those who feign their
resemblance from the liars and claim to be them when they actually are
not. In fact, the best people after the Prophets are the scholars, the
martyrs, those who spend in charity for the sake o f Allah and the sincere
ones, whilst the worst o f people are those who resemble them and give
the illusion that they are them, when they actually are not.”

seek his pardon before it is taken from him when he doesn’t own any

as the one who intentionally abandons a prescribed prayer will be

origin o f all immorality. Beware o f all sin, because sins earn the wrath

Moreover, there are a multitude o f narrations in this topic that we have
not cited. Thus, the one who self-counsels should not turn a blind eye
to them and indulge in sins whilst clinging onto the excuse o f hope and
good thoughts erroneously.
Abu al-W afa’ bin ‘Aqll said: “Be cautious from His punishment and do
not become deceived, for the hand is cut for the theft o f something
w orth a mere three dirhams, and the lashes are issued for the
consumption o f a small amount o f alcohol, a woman entered the Hellfire
on account o f a cat that she mistreated, and a garment o f clothing had
become fire for the one who unlawfully took it from the spoils o f war,
even though he was murdered by enemy combatants.”
Al-Imam Ahmad' said: “I was informed by Abu Mu awlyah who said I
was informed by al-A’mash on the authority o f Sulayman bin Maysarah
who narrated a narration from Tariq bin Hishab that is attributed to the
Prophet. “He said: ‘A man entered Paradise at the expense o f a fly, and a
man entered the Hellfire at the expense o f a fly.’ They said: ‘H ow is that,
O ’ Messenger o f Allah *g?’ He said: ‘Tw o men passed by a group o f
people who had an idol that they worshipped besides Allah. Nobody was
allowed to pass by it unless they offered a sacrifice for it. So it was said
to one o f the men, ‘Sacrifice something.’ He replied, ‘I do not have
anything to sacrifice.’ They said to him, ‘Sacrifice something even if it
is a fly.’ So he sacrificed the fly and they allowed him to pass and
consequently entered the Hellfire. They said to the other man, ‘Sacrifice

Deceived by the Favors That Allah Has Afforded
You in the W orldly Life
Perhaps, some o f those who have been deceived have relied on the
blessings that Allah has bestowed upon them in this life thinking that
they will not be a cause for change in him, whilst believing that he has
been awarded such things due to Allah’s love for him and that he shall
be awarded something even better in the Hereafter. Undoubtedly, this
is a form o f delusion.
Al-Imam A hm ad1said: I was informed by Yahya bin Ghaylan who said,
I was informed by Rishdayn bin Sa d on the authority of Harmalah bin

on the authority o f ‘ Uqbah bin ‘Amir who narrated that the Prophet
said: “If you see that Allah is giving His favors to a person in this life
whilst they are indulging in sins, know it is an allurement.” He then
recited the statement o f Allah:

“So w hen they forgot that by w hich they had been reminded, W e
opened to them the doors o f every good th in g until, w hen they
rejoiced from that w hich they were given, W e seized them

A narration has been attributed to A t-Tirm idhi in his collection stating
that the Prophet said: “Indeed, Allah affords the worldly life to those

faith to the one He loves.”
Some o f the Pious Predecessors (Salaf) would say: “There could be those
who are deluded by the blessings o f Allah upon him whilst he is

The Most Deluded Ones Are Those W ho Have
Been Deceived by this W orldly Life and its
Instant Riches
The most deluded creature is the one who is deceived by this worldly
life and its instant pleasures, valuing it over the Hereafter and being
content with it. To the extent that some o f them say: “This world is an
instant form of money, but the Hereafter is delayed credit, and instant
money it better than credit!”
Others say: “A seed that is instant is better than a pearl that has been
promised.”
Another individual said: “The pleasures o f this life are guaranteed,
whereas the pleasure o f the Hereafter are in doubt and I will not forsake
certainty for doubt.”
This is from the most powerful forms o f the Devil’s deception and
enticement. The barbaric beasts are more astute than these individuals
since the beast does not advance towards anything if it fears harm from
it, even if it is beaten to do so. However, the likes o f those mentioned
above will encroach towards their own destruction, whilst they are
either truthful about it or in denial. As for this category o f people, if one
o f them were believe in Allah, His Messenger, meeting Allah and the
final judgm ent, then he will experience the greatest despair because he
has embarked on this upon knowledge. O n the other hand, if he does
not believe in Allah and His Messenger, then he is even further astray.
As for the statement o f the one who says, “instant money is better than
credit,” the response to it is as follows: If the instant money is equivalent
89

The Disease A n d The Cure

to the delayed credit, then the money is better. However, if they differ
in value and the delayed credit is more than the instant money, then the
credit is better. So then what would be the case since the entire worldly
life from its beginning to end is like one breath from the breaths o f the
Hereafter! As has been reported in the M usnad o f al-Imam Ahmad and
A t-Tirm idhi1on the authority o f al-Mustawrid bin Shaddad who said:
“The Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘The worldly life in comparison to the
Hereafter is similar to the amount o f water one gets when he puts his
finger in the sea. Let him then see what it returns w ith.’” So preferring
this instant money over the delayed payment is from the most striking
forms o f deception and most shameful types o f ignorance. N ow if this
comparison is o f this entire life, what is the value o f a person’s life in
comparison to the Hereafter? W hich one is more commendable for the
astute person: Valuing this instant life during this short span o f time and
being prevented from the eternal good in the Hereafter or leaving
something pathetic and insignificant that will soon come to and end to
eventually receive something precious, incomparable, enumerable and
eternal.
As for the statement o f the other one, “I will not forsake certainty for
doubt,” it should be said to him: Either you are in doubt about the
promise and threat o f Allah and the honesty o f His Prophets, or you are
assured o f all o f that. If you are sure o f it, then you would only have left
a small seed that is soon to cease and disappear in exchange for
something wherein there is no doubt or end.
If you are in doubt, review the signs o f Allah that prove His existence,
His ability, Will, Oneness and the honesty o f His Messenger in
everything they have conveyed about Him. Be fair and analytical until

it becomes unequivocally clear to you that the message brought by the
Messengers from Allah is the indisputable truth, and that the Creator o f
the universe is the Lord o f the heavens and the earth and W ho is
perfectly exalted, sanctified and freed from anything that opposes what
His Messengers informed and conveyed. W hoever attributes any other
information to Him has insulted Him, opposed Him and denied His
Lordship and Sovereignty. As it is from the absolute impossibilities that
anyone with a sound natural inclination can deem that the True and
Sovereign King is incapable in any capacity, ignorant, unknowing,
unable to hear, cannot see, does not speak, nor command, nor prohibit,
nor recompense, nor give honor and disgrace to whom He wills, or is
unable to send His Messengers across the breadth o f His kingdom, or
have concern for His subjects and instead leave them in idleness and
disregard.
Such a state would be an impairment in any king from the human form
and something unbefitting to their majesty, so how could it ever be
permissible in relation to the Supreme and True King?!
if one contemplates on his own condition from the beginning o f his
formation as a drop o f semen until he attains full strength, it will become
evident to him that it could never be befitting for the O ne W ho took
care o f him, transformed him to the state he is in and advanced you
through these stages to leave him in disregard, or neglect, or without
command or prohibit or grant him the knowledge o f His rights or
recompense him.
Moreover, if one truly contemplates, everything that you see or do not
see will be evidence o f His Oneness, the prophecies, the Hereafter and
that the Q u r’an is His W ord. W e have already mentioned the angles o f
deriving the evidences for this in the book ‘A ym ati a l-Q u r’atT in
explanation o f the verse:

the Qur’an is the word o f a noble M essenger.” [al-Haqah:38-40]
He also mentioned a piece o f this evidence in His statement:
0 6 ^ ^ * 4 ^ 1 3 3
“And in your ow n selves, do you not see.” [Adh-Dhariyat:2l]
The human is evidence for his own self in proving the existence o f his
Creator and His Oneness, the honesty o f His Messengers and an
affirmation o f His Perfect Attributes.
Thus, is has become clear that the deceived one is w rong from both
perspectives: The perspective o f his affirmation and certitude and the
perspective o f his denial and doubt.
If one were to say: How can resolute conviction that does not contain
any doubt about the Hereafter or Paradise or Hellfire be harmonized
with an absence o f actions? And is it from human nature to know that
one is requested to stand before a king tomorrow so that he may chastise
him in the most severe way or honor him to the upmost degree, yet he
spends his nights heedless, forgetting his standing before the King,
w ithout preparing for it or being alert? It would be said -b y Allah- this
is a good question that relates to most of the creation, whilst combining
both these contradictions is from the strangest o f things.
This absence o f good actions has numerous reasons:
O ne o f them is a weakness in knowledge and a deficiency in certitude,
and whoever believes that knowledge does not vary has made an
erroneous and false statement o f great proportions. Prophet Ibrahim
asked his Lord to show him how He brings life to the dead although he

92

The Disease A n d The Cure

knew that the Lord was capable in doing so. However, it was to gain an
increase in certitude and for the unseen matter to become something
that was witnessed.
Al-Imam Ahmad collects a narration in his M usnad': The Prophet said:
“O btaining information is not like witnessing.”
II a weakness in knowledge is combined with an inability to recollect it
at necessary times and an absence in the heart most o f the time due to a
preoccupation with its counteractive actions, and all this is consolidated
with the influence o f ones character, the dominance o f whims,
overwhelming desires, an enticement o f the soul, the devils deception,
misinterpreted concessions and general habits - if it reaches this stage,
none other than the O ne who holds the heavens and the earth from
falling can solidify the faith in a person. Due to this, faith is at contrasting
levels within a person until it reaches the size o f the most miniscule seed
within the heart.
All if these reasons originate from a weakness in insight and patience.
Thus, Allah praised the people who possess patience and certitude and
made them leaders in the religion:

“And W e made from am on g them leaders guiding by Our
C ommand w hen they were patient and they were certain o f Our
signs. ” [As-Sajda:24]

The Difference Between Good Thoughts and
Delusion
The difference between good thoughts and delusion has been previously
explained. It is that if the good thoughts motivate one to do good
actions, encourage an individual to do them and lead a person to them,
then it is sound and good. But if these same thoughts lead a person to
idleness and a devotion to sins, then it is in fact deception.
Having good thoughts is also the correct method o f hope. So whoever’s
hope attracts them to obedience and deters them from sin, then it is the
correct hope. However, whoever has confused the two and made his
lack o f good actions to be a form o f hope to the extent his hope amounts
to nothing more than idleness and neglect, then he is deluded.
If a man owned a plot o f land that he hoped would one day produce
crops that would benefit him, yet he neglects it, fails to plant it or
cultivate it but anticipates that it will become as cultivated as one who
takes care o f their land, plants the seeds, irrigates it and takes care o f it,
the people would deem him to be o f the most feebleminded individuals.
Likewise, similar examples would be if one were to have good thoughts
and strengthen their hope to conceive a child w ithout performing sexual
intercourse, or to become the most knowledgeable o f his generation
without seeking knowledge and a complete focus on it; and the
examples are numerous.
Similarly, the one who betters their thoughts and strengthens their hope
in achieving the loftiest levels in the Hereafter and the everlasting

“Indeed, those w ho have believed and those w ho have emigrated
and fought in the cause o f Allah - those hope for the Mercy o f
Allah. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.” [al-Baqarah:218]
Reflect on the point here that Allah deemed their hope to be their
fulfillment o f these actions mentioned in the verse. Yet the deluded ones
insist on saying: The neglectful and wasteful ones o f the rights o f Allah,
those who fail to actualize His commands, terrorize His servants and the
audacious in His prohibitions are the ones who hope for the Mercy of
Allah.
The defining subtlety in this matter is that hope and good thoughts are
fulfilled through the appropriate means that have been set by the Perfect
Wisdom o f Allah in His legislation, capability, recompense and
generosity. O ne must firstly implement them and also have good
thoughts about his Lord, direct his hope to Him that He does not allow
him to depend on his own self and to make these actions something that
will allow him to attain that which benefits him and diverts all else as
well as extinguish any remnants o f it.

The O bligation o f Hope
It must be known that the one w ho hopes in something must also
maintain a number o f things in his hope:
One: The love o f whatever he hopes for.
Two: A fear o f it escaping from him.
Three: An endeavor to attain it according to their capability.
As for the type o f hope that does not contain any o f the above, it is
considered a fake aspiration! Hope is one thing, and fake aspirations are
another. Everyone who has hope is also in fear, and if the one who is
journeying on a path is struck by fear, he begins to travel at a faster pace
in the fear that some assistance will pass him by.
In A t-T irm idhi1, he collects a narration on the authority o f Abu
Hurairah who said: “The Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘W hoever fears shall
hasten, and whoever hastens shall reach their destination. Indeed, the
merchandise o f Allah is valuable, the merchandise o f Allah is Paradise.’”
Just as Allah has declared that the correct hope pertains to those who
perform good actions, He likewise attributes the feeling o f fear to them
as well. Through this is know n that beneficial hope and fear is the type
that is coupled with righteous deeds. Allah said:

At-TirmidhT1collected a narration on the authority o f ‘Aisha who said:
“I asked the Messenger o f Allah^ about this verse.” She said: “Are they
those who drink intoxicants and steal?” He said: “No, O daughter o f AsSiddiq. They are those who fast, perform the prayers, give charity while
they fear that their Lord will not accept it from them. It is these who
hasten to do good deeds, and they are the foremost o f them.” This
narration has also been recorded on the authority o f Abu Hurairah.

Utmost Performance o f Good Deeds Alongside
U tm ost Fear
Allah has described the people o f bliss and goodness with the attribute
of fear and attributed wretchedness and misdeeds with having a false
sense o f security. W hoever reflects on the condition o f the Companions
will find that they managed to reach the ultimate level in their righteous
deeds and combine it with utmost fear. As for us, we have combined our
shortcomings -rather, a state o f negligence- alongside a false sense of
security!
Here you have As-Siddiq (Abu Bakr As-Siddiq) who said: “I wish I were
a mere hair on the body o f a believing servant'.”
It has also been mentioned that he would grab a hold o f his tongue and
then say, “This has doomed me!”2
He would also weep frequently and say: “W eep for yourselves! If you
cannot weep, then try hard to do so!”3 W hen he rose for prayer, he
would be as still as a plank o f wood from the fear he had o f Allah4.

O n one occasion a bird was brought to him, so he began to examine it,
then he said: “It was not hunted or brought down from a tree except as
a recompense for whatever it neglected from glorification o f the Lord.”'
W hen he was in the final moments o f his life, he said to [his daughter]
‘Aisha: “My daughter, I gained this cloak and this bucket and this servant
from the treasury o f the Muslims [which he was entitled to], so hasten
with them and hand them to [Umar] Ibn al-Khattab.”2
It was also narrated that he said: “I would love to have been this tree to
be chewed and eaten up!”3
Qatada said: “It has reached me that Abu Bakr said: ‘I would like to have
been a plant that was eaten by the livestock.’”4
And here we see the condition o f Umar bin al-Khattab. O n one occasion
he recited the chapter o f A t- T u r until he reached the verse:

“Indeed, the punishm ent o f your Lord w ill com e to pass.” [AtTur:?]
It caused him to weep, and his weeping became so severe that he fell ill,
and people began to visit him due to his illness. As he was in his final
moments, he addressed his son and said: “W oe to you! Place my cheek
on the floor, perhaps Allah will forgive me.” He then said: “I have lost
out if Allah does not forgive me.” He repeated this three times before
passing. He would recite his daily portion o f Q ur’an through the night

sometimes and pass by a particular verse and it would affect him, so he
would remain in his house for days until the people would visit him
because they thought he was ill. He had two visible black lines under his
eyes from the effects o f crying.
Ibn ‘Abbas once said to him: “Allah allowed you to enter lands and
conquer different countries.” He replied: “I only wish to be saved
w ithout anything held against m e.”
As for Uthman bin ‘Affan: If he stood at a gravesite, he would weep until
he w et his beard1. He also said: “If I were in a place between Paradise
and the Hellfire, not know ing where I would be ordered to go, I would
choose to be dust before I know where I will end up.”2
Here we see the condition o f Ali bin Abi Talib and his w eeping and fear
o f Allah. His apprehension would intensify from two things. The hope
o f lasting in this life, valuing it over the Hereafter and following the
soul’s desires. He said: “As for the first, it makes you forget the Hereafter,
and as for following one’s desires, it obstructs from accepting the truth.
Indeed, this life is retreating and the Hereafter is approaching, each o f
them have children, so be from the children o f the Hereafter and do not
be from the children o f this world. For today there is opportunity for
action w ithout reckoning, and tom orrow there will be a reckoning
w ithout any opportunity for action.”’

death, you would never eat with an appetite, nor would you drink
anything with an appetite, you would not have entered your homes to
seek shade and you would have gone out to the vast open plains beating
your chests and weeping over your sins. I wish I were a tree that was

U nder the eyes o f Abdullah bin ‘Abbas resembled decrepit shoelaces

Abu Thar would say: “I wish I were a tree that was chewed up, and I

Charity was presented to him but he would say: “W e have a goat that

One night, Tamim Ad-Dari recited the chapter o f al-Jathiyah. W hen he

The Fear o f the Com panions From Falling Into
Hypocrisy
Al-BukharT has recorded a chapter in his S a h ih 1: “Chapter: The fear that
the believer has from his actions being null whilst he is unaware.”
Ibrahim At-Taym i said: “Every time I measure my speech against my
actions I fear that I am from the dishonest.”2 Ibn Abi Mulaykah: “I met
thirty men from the Companions o f the Messenger o f Allah
all o f
them feared falling into hypocrisy. N one o f them would say that their
faith is as complete as the faith o f Angel(s) Jibril and M ika’il.”3 It has also
been reported from al-Hassan to have said: “N obody but a believer fears
it [hypocrisy], and nobody but a hypocrite feels safe from it.”
Umar bin al-Khattab would say to Hudhayfah: “I place an oath on you
by Allah, did the Messenger o f A llah^ mention me to you [among the
list o f hypocrites]?” Hudhayfah would reply: “No, and I shall not
vindicate anyone after you.”
I heard our Shaykh [ibn TaymTyah] say: “His intent here is not that there
are not others w ho have been freed from hypocrisy; rather, I will not
give everyone the opportunity to ask me the question of: ‘Did the
Prophet name me to you?’”

This example resembles the response that the Prophet gave the man who
asked him whether he was from the seventy thousand among his nation
that will enter Paradise w ithout reckoning: “You have been preceded by
‘Ukasha.”1 He did not intend that Ukasha would be alone in this regard
amongst his Companions. However, had the Prophet supplicated for the
other man as well, many others would have risen to ask the same
question and there may be an individual who would ask but is
undeserving o f being am ong them. Thus, it was better to initially
withhold from presenting this opportunity. Allah knows best.

Recom m encing to the Cure for the Illness
Let us return to mention the cure to this illness, which if continues shall
ruin the worldly affairs and the Hereafter o f a servant. It must be known
that sins are an inevitable harm, and their harms on the heart is like the
harm that poison poses on the body at its various intensities. Now, is
there any evil in this life or the next except that the reason for it is sins
and disobedience?
W hat is it that caused Adam and Hawa to be expelled from Paradise, the
abode o f delight, bliss and jo y to the abode o f pains, sorrow and
calamities? W hat is it that caused Iblis (Satan) to be expelled from the
gatherings o f the heavens and receiving the curse, transforming him to
the most despicable o f creation and making his inner self more heinous
than his outer appearance? Ousted from a state o f nearness to
banishment, from mercy to accursed, beauty to hideousness, from
Paradise to Hell, faith to disbelief, being a close ally to a disputant and
an enemy, from performing tasblh glorifying the Lord to disbelief and
polytheism and lying and fraud and immorality, and from being
immersed in faith to being immersed in disbelief, corruption and
disobedience. Thus, he became insignificant to Allah and became
debased. Allah became angry with him, so He banished him.
Henceforth, he became a leader to every immoral person and criminal
who is pleased with him as a leader, all after the initial state o f worship
and honor. W e seek refuge in You - O ’ Allah- from ever opposing Your
Comm and and partaking in Your prohibitions.
W hat is it that caused the people in the land to drown beneath the waters
that rose above the mountaintops?

W hat is it that caused the wind to overwhelm the people o f ‘Ad until
they all lay dead on the earth as if they were hollow date palm tree

succeeded them until the Day o f Resurrection?
W hat is it that caused the awful cry to overcome the people ofT ham ud
until it tore apart their hearts inside their bodies and they all died?
W hat is it that caused the towns o f the homosexuals to be lifted up into
the sky, until the Angels heard the barking o f their dogs before being
turned upside down making its higher part the lowest, destroying them
all? After that, they were pelted with stones from the heavens. Their
punishment combined that which was not combined in any other
punishment to any other nation. Their counterparts will receive a
similar fate and it is ever so near to the wrongdoers.
W hat is it that caused the dark clouds to be sent over the people o f
Shu’ayb before they settled above their heads and fire rained from the
sky?
W hat is it that caused the Pharoah and his people to drown in the sea
before their souls were cast into the fire? Their bodies were drowned
whilst their souls were burnt.
W hat was it that caused Qarun, his home, his wealth and his family to
be swallowed by the earth?
W hat is it that caused the generation after Noah to be afflicted with
various punishments and be completely destroyed?
W hat is it that caused the people mentioned in Ya Sin to be doomed
with an awful cry, completely destroying them all?
W hat is it that caused a mighty people to be sent to the children o f IsraTl

their women and children, burning the homes and looting the wealth?
Then they were sent a second time and they inflicted further destruction
and took over with complete destruction. W hat is it that brought about
various punishments? At times through death or imprisonment or a
destruction o f the land or the oppression o f a ruler, and on another
occasion by transforming them into apes and pigs, all concluded with
an oath that Allah made:

“And m ention w hen your Lord declared that He would surely

on the authority o f Amr bin Murra who narrates from Salim bin Abu
Ja’ad who narrates from Abu Ubayda, who narrates from Abdullah bin
Mas'ud who said: “The Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘Those who came
before you, if any o f them were to commit a misdeed, another person
would inadequately prohibit the perpetrator. Then he would meet him
the next day, he would sit in his gathering and eat and drink with him.
W hen it came to this, Allah led their hearts into evil ways. Then he
cursed them upon the tongue o f their Prophet, Dawud and ‘Isa, the son
of Mary. This was due to their disobedience and transgression.
Then he continued: ‘Nay, by The One W hose Hand my soul is in, you
either enjoin good and forbid evil and catch hold o f the criminal and
persuade him to act justly and stick to the truth, or Allah will strike your
hearts against one another and will curse you as He had cursed them .’”
Ibn Abi A d-D unya: narrated from Ibrahim bin Amr As-San’ani who
said: “Allah revealed to Yusha’ bin Nun: ‘Indeed, I will destroy forty

He said: ‘They never became angry for My sake, instead, they would

they said: ‘O ur Lord, there is your servant praying.’ Allah then said:
‘Destroy the village including him, for his face has never become angry

was commanded to destroy a village, so the Angel said: ‘My Lord, in it
is your servant, an avid worshiper.’ So Allah revealed to this Angel that
he should begin with him, for his face has never shown any anger for

Ibn Abi A d-Dunya: narrates from W ahb bin Munabih who said: “W hen
Prophet Dawud fell into a sin, he said: ‘My Lord, forgive me.’ He said:
‘I have forgiven you and placed its shame on the children o f Isra’ll.’
Prophet Dawud said: ‘My Lord, how? And You are The Most Wise,

Ibn Abi A d-Dunya' also narrates that the earth trembled in the era o f
the Messenger o f Allah

it isn’t time for you yet.” Then he turned to face his Companions and
said: “Your Lord wants you to please Him, so please H im .” Then the
earth trembled in the era o f Umar bin al-Khattabs’s rulership, so he said:
“This tremble is nothing other than a result o f something you have
innovated. By the O ne Whose Hand my soul is in, if it re-occurs, I will

Ibn A bi-A d-D unya2 mentions amongst the virtues o f Umar ibn alKhattab that the earth trembled in the time o f Umar, so he stuck it with

tails [cling avidly to the worldly life, agriculture etc.] and abandon the
fight in the cause o f Allah, Allah will descend a calamity upon them and
will not remove it until they return to their religion.’” Abu Dawud also
collected this narration through an authentic (hasan) chain of

Ibn Abi A d-Dunya: also mentioned a narration on the authority o f Ibn

B ukhtu Nassar (Nebuchadnezzar) said to Prophet Daniel: “W hat is it that

Ibn abi A d-D unya’ collects a narration on the authority o f Ammar bin
Yasir and Hudhayfah who reported that the Prophet said: “Indeed, if
Allah wants to trial a people, he causes their children to die and makes
their women barren so the trial befalls and none are shown mercy.”
H e4 also reported from Malik bin Dinar who said: “I read within the
early scriptures: ‘Allah says: I am Allah the King o f all kings, the hearts

to be a mercy to their subjects, and whoever disobeys me, I shall make
them a trial upon their subjects. So do not preoccupy yourselves with
insulting the kings, instead, repent to Me and I shall make them kind to

Also from the M ursal narrations o f al-Hasan: “If Allah wills good for a

Al-Imam Ahmad mentioned in A z-Zuhd that there was a Rabbi from
the children o f Brail who would receive men and women who would
frequent his house so that he would admonish them and remind them o f
the days o f Allah. O n an occasion, he witnessed one o f his children harass
a woman, so he said: “Be cautious my son, be cautious my son.”
Consequently, he fell from his bed, broke his spine, his wife had a
miscarriage and his children were killed. Allah then revealed to their
Prophet to inform this Rabbi that He shall never provide him with
truthful offspring. His anger for My sake did not amount to any more
than: “Be cautious my son, be cautious my son.”
Also in the M ustiad o f al-Imam A hm ad1on the authority o f Ibn Mas ud:
“The Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘Beware o f the sins that people deem
insignificant, for indeed they accumulate against an individual until they
destroy him .’ The Messenger o f Allah^ struck a parable. It was o f a
group o f people who found themselves in a barren land before they
eventually found food. So one o f the men would go and fetch wood and
return with it, and another man would do the same until they gathered
a vast amount and kindle their fire, then they cooked their food.’”
In the Sahih o f al-BukharT2 on the authority o f Anas bin Malik who said:
“You indulge in sins which are more insignificant to you than a hair
while we considered them at the time o f Messenger o f Allah sS to be from

Also in the Sahih o f al-Bukhari and the Sahih o f Muslim 1 on the

give it something to drink, nor did she allow it to eat from the vermin

Abu N u’aym collected a narration in H ilyatul A w liy a 2 on the authority

religion abruptly in one day?” He replied: “No, rather, if they were
commanded to do something, they would not, and if they were
prohibited from something, they would partake in it until they became
detached from their religion, just as a man becomes detached from his

Thus, some o f the Pious Predecessors have derived from this that sins are
an avenue to disbelief just as a kiss leads to intercourse, music leads to
fornication, a look leads to lust and as illness leads to death.
Also in H ilyatul A w liya 'on the authority o f Ibn Abbas who said: “O ’

trialed him .”
Al-Imam Ahmad said: “W e were informed by al-W alid who said, I

Ad-Darda’ w ho said: “One should beware from receiving a curse from
the hearts o f the believers whilst he is unaware.” He w ent on to say: “Do
you know what this is from?” I replied: “N o.” He said: “Indeed, a servant
may isolate himself to disobey Allah, so Allah places a hatred towards
him in the hearts o f the believers, whilst he is unaware.”
Abdullah the son o f (Imam) Ahmad reports that when Muhammad bin
Sirin was overcome by his debts, he was struck by anguish and he said:
“Indeed, I know that this anguish is a result o f a sin I committed forty
years ago.”
Here is a subtle point that people m ake a mistake in regarding sins.
It is that they do no see the effect o f the sin immediately, as it could be
delayed. So the servant deems that there will not be any effect
afterwards, just as the poet said:
If the wall doesn’t produce dust when it crumbles — then there will never be
dust after it has fallen

Glory be to Allah! How much damage to the creation has this calamity
caused! How many blessings has it eradicated! How many tribulations
has it incited! There are plenty o f knowledgeable ones who have been
deceived through this ploy, let alone the ignorant! The deluded one has
not become aware that the sin corrupts, even if it takes a while just as
the poison does and just as the wound if it is reopened after some time.
Al-Imam Ahmad reported in A z-Zuhd on the authority o f Abu AdDarda who said: “W orship Allah as if you see Him, consider yourselves
amongst the dead, know that a small am ount o f good will suffice you

from a large am ount o f something that distracts you. Know that
righteousness does not die, and the sin is never forgotten.” Some o f the
avid worshippers looked at a boy to w onder over his looks. As a result,
they were told in their dreams: “They shall see its effects after forty
years.” Nonetheless, this is the case even though the sin also has an
immediate effect that does not delay. Sulayman At-Taym i said: “Indeed
a man can perpetrate a sin in seclusion and awake in the m orning and
its shame is visible on him.”1
Yahya bin M u’ath Ar-Razi said: “I am astounded that someone with
intellect can say in their invocation: ‘Allah, do not allow my enemies to
gloat over me,’ yet he causes all o f his enemies to gloat over him!” It was
asked: “H ow is that?” He replied: “He disobeys Allah and every enemy
o f his gloats over him on the Day o f Resurrection.”

The 111 Effects o f Sins in This Life and the
Hereafter
Sins have a repugnantly vile and damaging effect on the heart and body
in the worldly life and the Hereafter, the likes o f which none can truly
know except Allah.
From them is: The deprivation o f know ledge. Knowledge is a light
that is thrust by Allah into the heart, whilst sins extinguish that light.
W hen al-Shafi'T sat before Malik and studied under him, Malik was
impressed by what he witnessed from his astuteness, sharp intelligence
and excellent understanding, so he said to him: “1 see that Allah has
placed light into your heart, so do not put it out with the darkness o f
disobedience.”
Al-Shafi I also said on another occasion:
I complained to W a k i’ about m y poor memory — so he instructed me to
leave off sins
H e said to me: K now that this knowledge is a blessing — and the blessings
of A llah are not given to sinners

From them: The deprivation o f provisions. Al-Imam Ahmad collects
in al-M usnad: “Indeed, a servant is deprived o f provisions due to a sin he
perpetrates.” 1 Just as piety is a reason for attaining provisions,

abandoning it is a reason for destitution. The provisions o f Allah have
never been gained by anything as powerful as the abandonment o f sins.
From them: A feeling o f desolation that the sinner feels in his heart
betw een him and Allah. The kind that does not measure up to or
compare to any pleasure, even if all the pleasure o f this life were
combined, they would not equate to filling the void made by this feeling
o f desolation. This is something that only those with life in their hearts
can comprehend.
A n d the wound doesn’t cause pain to the dead

If sins were only abandoned out o f caution from feeling this desolation,
it would be worthwhile for the one who possesses intellect.
A man complained to the ‘learned’ ones about a feeling o f desolation
that he finds in his heart, he said:
If the sins have made yon desolate — leave them if yon will and he affable

There is nothing more bitter to the heart than the pain o f a sin in
succession o f another, Allah’s aid is sought.
From them: Seclusion from the people, especially the righteous,
because he will feel some isolation from them. Every time this feeling
strengthens, they grow further apart, he is deprived from benefiting
from them and draws even nearer to the party o f Satan as much as he
distances himself from the party o f Allah. This feeling intensifies until it
becomes controlling, thus appearing between him and his spouse, his
children, his relatives and even with his own self to the extent you may
even find that he is dejected. Some o f the Pious Predecessors have
mentioned: “Indeed, I disobey Allah, and I notice it effects in the
behavior o f my riding beast and my wife.”
From them: A difficulty in accom plishing matters. He does not focus
on a task except that he finds it obstructed or extremely difficult to
134

The Disease A n d The Cure

complete. This is parallel to the one who obeys Allah, He will make his
tasks easy. Thus, whoever renounces piety shall have his tasks made
difficult for him. It is astounding! H ow one finds that all the doors to
good are shut in front o f him, and the benefits have obstructions before
them and the paths to them are blocked, yet he does not know how it
has happened?
From them: An actual darkness one finds in their heart. He senses it
just like he senses the darkness o f the dark night when it covers the
horizon. This equates the darkness o f sin on his heart to the tangible
darkness in his vision. Indeed, obedience is light, and sin is darkness.
And every time this darkness intensifies, so does his confusion until he
falls into innovation, misguidance and destructive actions whilst
unaware, just like the blind person if he were to solely walk out on a
dark night. This darkness develops until it is visible in the eye and
continues to grow until it becomes a blackness that is visible on the face.
Ibn Abbas said: “Indeed, the good deed illuminates the face, casts light
into the heart, brings vast provisions, builds strength in the body and
attracts the love in the hearts o f the creation. Indeed, the sin darkens the
face, casts darkness into the heart, brings weakness to the body, a
depreciation in provisions and a hatred in the hearts o f the creation.”
From them: Sins w eaken the heart and body. As for the weakness it
causes to the heart, it is obvious and continues to weaken it until it
completely exhausts any life in it.
As for the weakness in the body, it is due to the strength o f the believer
stemming from the heart. As for the immoral one, even if he is physically
strong, he is actually weak when the strength is required, and his
strength will betray him at a time o f dire need. Reflect over the physical
strength o f the Persians and the Romans and how it let them down in
their m om ent o f dire need, for they were defeated by the faithful ones
using their physical and spiritual strength o f the heart.
135

The Disease A n d The Cure

From them: B eing prevented from carrying out obedience. It would
be enough o f a punishment for a sin that it prevents one from
performing an act o f obedience in its place, stopping the path to another
act o f obedience and a third and a fourth and so on and so forth. Thus,
many acts o f obedience being cut short, each better for an individual
than the worldly life and all its possessions. This scenario is similar to
one wherein a man eats a meal that causes him a lengthy illness that
prevents him from many other meals that are more delicious. Allah’s aid
is sought.
From them: Sins reduce lifespan and erase the blessings. Just as
righteousness increases a lifespan, immorality shortens it. However, the
scholars have differed here. A group o f them said the shortage in the life
span o f a sinner is in fact the disappearance o f its blessings and its loss.
Undoubtedly, this is true, and it is a portion o f the effects o f sin.
Another group o f them said it actually decreases just as sustenance
decreases. Allah set reasons for an increase and blessing in sustenance,
and He has done the same for the lifespan. They said there is no
objection that achieving an increase in lifespan comes through particular
means, just as it may decrease due to particular reasons. Sustenance and
length o f life, happiness and wretchedness, health and illness, wealth and
destitution, since they are all decreed by the Lord, it is also correct to say
that He decrees whatever He wills through particular means that He has
set that gain and necessitate them.
A third group declared that the effect that sins have in the shortening o f
life is in reference to the true essence o f life which is the life o f the heart.
Hence, Allah has declared that the disbeliever is dead, w ithout life, as He
said:

136

The Disease A n d The Cure

“They are dead, w ithout life.” [A n-N ahl:2l]
The true essence o f life is the life o f the heart, and his age only signifies
his lifespan. His age only signifies the length o f period o f his life, they
are the hours in his life. So righteousness and obedience increase this
time.
In summary, if the servant turns away from Allah and becomes
preoccupied with sins, his days that make up the true essence o f life
would have been squandered, and he will only realize the effect o f this
frivolity on the day he will say,

“I w ish I had put som ething forth for m y life.” [al-Fajr:24]
Either he has regard for his worldly and afterlife, or he does not. If he
does not, he has wasted his entire life and it has fruitlessly passed him by.
However, if he does have some regard, then his path has become long
and difficult due to the obstacles and the means to good have become
difficult due to his preoccupation with their contrary factors, and this is
the true deficiency o f a person’s life.
The secret here is that the age o f a person is the length o f his life, but
there is no life w ithout a devotion to his Lord, appreciating a love for
Him and His remembrance whilst favoring His pleasure.

137

The Disease A n d The Cure

Sins Give Birth to T heir Counterparts
From the harms o f sin is that a sin will produce another sin similar to it,
and they will give birth to one another until detaching and relieving
oneself from it and becomes difficult. As some o f the Pious Predecessors
(Salaf) said: “From the punishments o f perform ing a sin is to successively
perform another sin, and from the rewards o f performing a good deed
is to successively perform a good deed.” Therefore, if an individual
performs a good deed, the deed tells its close counterpart to activate into
action, if the person does as much, a second one will be called into action
and so on and so forth. Thus, the gains are multiplied, and the rewards
increase. The same applies to the misdeeds until each o f the two that are
being practiced - whether it is sins or misdeeds - become firm
prerequisites, indispensable attributes and resolute abilities w ithin a
person. O n one hand, if a good person renounces obedience to Allah,
he becomes uncomfortable w ithin himself, he feels as if the land and its
vastness becomes closely constricted and gains a sense o f being like a fish
out o f water, until he re-commits to obedience, at which point his soul
finds ease and his eyes delight. O n the other hand, if a scandalous person
devotes himself to the obedience o f Allah, he becomes uncomfortable
w ithin himself, his chest feels constricted and he feels helpless until he
re-commits to sin. It has reached a point wherein many o f the immoral
individuals practice sin w ithout drawing any pleasure from it or there
being a need for it, they do it for none other than the pain they find in
leaving it, as the leading scholar -al-Hasan bin H ani’- from them (the
Sufi mystics) has declared:
A glass that I drink from out of pleasure — and another I drink as a remedy
from the first

139

The Disease A n d The Cure

Another one said:
II was m y medicine whilst it is m y actual illness — just as the wine drinker
remedies using the same wine

The servant continues to strive upon obedience, becoming accustomed
to it, loving it and favoring it until Allah, by His Mercy, sends Angels to
drive him even further in obedience, and they aid him in maintaining a
keenness for it and entice him towards it from the comfort o f his bed or
place o f rest. Contrary to this, one can become accustomed to sins, love
them and favor them over all else until Allah sends the devils to incite
him even further. So the first one strengthened the cavalry o f obedience
with the aid o f Allah, and it became his biggest form o f assistance, whilst
the second one strengthened his cavalry with the help o f the devils, and
they became his biggest form o f support.
From them -an d it is from the most frightful for an individual- It
w eakens the resolve o f the heart for good, strengthening the
determination for sin and gradually weakening the will power to repent,
until any will to repent becomes detached in its entirety, to the extent
that if half o f him dies, he would not repent to Allah. A superficial
repentance heard on the tongues o f the dishonest one is frequently heard
whilst his heart is intertwined with sins, persistent upon them and
determined to execute them whenever he can. This is from the most
detrimental illnesses and the closest to destruction.
From them: The vileness o f the sin escapes him , so it becomes a
custom to the person and he does not deem it to be vile that the people
witness him perpetrate the sin or that they may speak about him. This is
the behavior o f the leading figures in immorality and the pinnacle o f
shamelessness wherein he finds absolute pleasure. O ne o f them may even
boast about his sin and inform those who are ignorant o f it, he may say:
“O so and so, 1 did such and such!” These types o f people are seldom
forgiven and the avenues to repentance become obstructed or
140

The Disease A n d The Cure

completely closed on most occasions, as the Prophet said: “My entire
nation is forgiven, except the brazen. Indeed, being brazen is for Allah
to conceal the sin o f the servant, then he awakes in the m orning to
embarrass himself and say: ‘O so and so, on that day I did such and such,’
shaming himself when he had spent the night being concealed by his
Lord.”1
From them is that: Every sin has been inherited from a previous
nation that Allah destroyed. Sodomy has been inherited from the
people o f Lut. Unfairly over-accepting your rights and offering the
rights o f others insufficiently is an inheritance from the people o f
Shu’ayb. Haughtiness and corruption on the earth are an inheritance
from the Pharoah and his people. Arrogance and tyranny are an
inheritance from the people o f Hud. Thus, the sinner is draped in the
clothing o f a selection o f these nations, and they are the enemies o f Allah.
Abdullah bin Ahmad has reported in the book o f Z iilid by his father on
the authority o f Malik bin Dinar w ho said: “Allah revealed to one o f the
Prophets o f the Children o f b ra’ll to say to his people: ‘Do not enter the
passages o f My enemies, do not wear the clothing o f My enemies, do
not ride the mediums o f My enemies, do not eat the food o f My enemies
lest you become My enemies just as they are My enemies.’”
In the M usnad o f al-Imam Ahmad2 on the authority o f Abdullah bin
Umar who narrates from the Prophet who said: “I have been sent with
the sword before the final hour so that Allah is worshiped alone w ithout
partners, my sustenance has been placed in the shadow o f my sword

(spoils o f war), and humiliation and inferiority has been set on the one
w ho opposes my command. W hoever resembles a people is from them .”
From them is: Sins are a cause for a servant to becom e insignificant
to his Lord, falling in status.
Al-Hasan al-Basri said: “They became insignificant to Him, and they
disobeyed Him. Had they have been honored, He would have
safeguarded them .”
If the servant becomes insignificant to Allah, he (the servant) shall not
find anyone to honor him, as Allah says:
d|)t ^ jsC *

A Li & \

“W hoever Allah humiliates, for him there is non e to honor h im .”
[al-Hajj:18]
Even if the people elevate him due to their need for him or out o f fear
from his evil, he remains the most despicable and degraded thing in their
hearts.
From them: A servant w ill continue to perpetrate a sin until it
becom es insignificant to him , and it diminishes in his heart. That is a
sign o f doom, because the sin magnifies with Allah the more it
diminishes in the eye o f the perpetrator.
Al-BukharT mentions in his Sahib' on the authority o f Ibn Mas ud who
said: “The believer sees his sins as if he was at the base o f a mountain,
fearing that it was about to fall upon him. The wicked person sees his
sins as if (they are) flies are falling on his nose and he says: ‘Like this’ m otioning with his hand - to swat them away.”

From them is: Other people and other livin g creatures w ill
experience the evil effects o f the sin. Thus, he and others are scolded
by the evil o f sin and oppression. Abu Hurairah said: “Indeed, the birds
will die in their nests from the oppression o f an oppressor.” Mujahid said:
“Indeed, the livestock curse the disobedient ones from the children o f
Adam. If the droughts intensify and the rain is withheld, they say: ‘This
is from the evil o f the sins o f the children o f Adam.’” ‘Ikrimah said: “The
creatures o f the land and the vermin, even the beetles and the scorpions
say: ‘W e have been denied rainfall due to the sins o f the children o f
Adam.’”
So in reality, the punishment of his sin is not enough until he stands on
the receiving end o f a curse from the ones w ho have not sinned.
From them: The sin inevitably causes hum iliation. All o f honor can
be found in the obedience o f Allah. Allah said:
0 iL J r

A ll fyA\ L J

“W hoever desires honor, then to Allah belongs all hon or.”
[Fatir:10]
In other words, one should seek it through the obedience to Allah, he
shall not find it elsewhere. It was from the customary supplications o f
the Pious Predecessors to say: “O ’ Allah, grant me honor through my
obedience to You, and do not humiliate me through sin.”
Al-Hassan al-Basri said: “Even if their mules obey them, and they ride
the horses swiftly, the humiliation o f sin never leaves them. Allah
chooses to humiliate anyone who disobeys H im .”
Abdullah bin al-Mubarak said:
I found that sins kill the heart — and an addiction to them brings
humiliation

Abandoning sins is life to the heart — and it is good for your soul that you
oppose it (the soul)
W ho else other than the (oppressive) kings have spoiled the religion — and
the evil scholars and the Iiabbis

From them: Sins corrupt the m ind. The mind contains a light and sin
extinguishes this light, and if its light is extinguished the mind weakens
and becomes deficient. Some o f the Pious Predecessors (Salaf) would say:
“Only the one whose mind is absent disobeys Allah.”
This is an obvious point. For if he were to activate his thought process,
it would prevent him from sins, bearing in mind he is within the grasp
o f the Lord and under His control; Fie sees all, he in within His
kingdom, the Angels are testifying and they see him, the admonition o f
the Q ur’an forbids him, the admonition o f faith forbids him, the
reminder o f death forbids him, the Hellfire forbids him and the good in
this life and the Hereafter which is manifold to the jo y and pleasure o f
the sin will escape him if he performs it. So would anyone with a sound
mind belittle all o f this and regard it with contempt?
From them: If the sins accumulate and multiply, they becom e
sealed over the heart. Thus, he becomes from the heedless, and the
Salaf explained the verse:
0 O jl .^=aj \y& Ui

& O'j

“N o, rather, the stain (Ran) has covered their hearts from that
w hich they used to earn.” [al-Mutafifin:14] to be, ‘one sin after
another.’
Al-Hasan said: “It is one sin after another until the heart becomes
blinded.” Others have said: “W hen their sins grew, they enveloped their
hearts.”

144

The Disease A nd The Cure

The root o f all this is that the hearts rust due to sins. If this rust increases,
it becomes a stain that covers the heart (Ran), then it increases to become
a seal and a cover until the heart becomes completely wrapped. If the
affair reaches this stage after receiving the guidance and insight, the
person retrogresses, and his reality becomes confused. He will begin to
deem the highs as lows, at which point he will become subdued by his
enemy and will lead him wherever he wills.
From them: Sins include the servant in the curse o f the Messenger
o f Allah
He cursed the one w ho perpetrates particular sins, whilst
some are worse than others, and they warrant the perpetrator to be
cursed even more. He cursed the tattooist and the one who receives the
tattoo, the w ig maker and the one who wears hair extensions, the one
who plucks the eyebrows and the person who receives the treatment,

this invocation if they do not attribute themselves with the traits o f the

Also from the punishm ent o f a sin has been collected by al-Bukhari
in his Sa h ih 1 on the authority o f Samura bin Jundub who said: “Allah's
Messenger very often used to ask his Companions, ‘Did anyone o f you
see a dream?’ So those whom Allah willed it for would narrate dreams
to him. One m orning the Prophet said, ‘Last night two persons came to
me [in the dream], woke me up and said to me, ‘Proceed!11 set out with
them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another man
was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throw ing
the rock at the man's head, striking his head with the rock. The rock
would then roll away and the thrower would follow it and return. By
the time he reached the man again, his head returned to the normal state.
The thrower then repeated the procedure. I said to my two companions,
'Subhan Allah! W ho are these two persons?’ They said, 'Proceed,
proceed!' So we proceeded and came across a man lying flat on his back
and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold,
he would put the hook in one side o f the man's mouth and tear off that
side o f his face to the back o f the neck, and similarly tear his nose from
front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other
side o f the man's face and did just as he had done with the other side. He
hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal
state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to
my two companions, 'Subhan Allah! W ho are these two persons?’ They
said to me, 'Proceed, proceed!' So we proceeded and came across
something like a Tantm r [a kind o f baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined
for baking bread].’ He said: ‘In that oven there was much noise and
voices.’ The Prophet added, ‘W e looked into it and found naked men

and women, and behold, a flame o f fire was reaching them from
underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. 1 asked them,
'W ho are these?’ They said to me, 'Proceed, proceed!' And so we
proceeded and came across a river as red as blood.’ The Prophet added,
‘And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank
there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the other
man was swimming, he w ent near him. The former opened his mouth
and the latter on the bank threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he
w ent swimming again. He returned and every time the performance
was repeated. 1 asked my two companions, 'W ho are these persons?’
They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' And we proceeded till we came to a
man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance you
ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling
it and running around it. I asked my companions, 'W ho is this?’ They
said to me, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we reached a garden
o f deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts o f spring colors. In the
midst o f the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his
head because o f his great height, and around him there were children in
such a large number, more than I have ever seen. I said to my
companions, 'W ho is this?’ They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we
proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better
than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, 'Go up.' And I
went up.’ The Prophet added, ‘So we ascended till we reached a city
built o f gold and silver bricks and we w ent to its gate and asked the
gatekeeper to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city
and found in it, men with one side o f their bodies as handsome as the
most handsome person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as
the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered
those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river
flowing across the city, and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those
men w ent and threw themselves in it and then returned to us, when they

returned, the ugliness had disappeared, and they became in the best
shape.’ The Prophet further added, ‘My two companions (Angels) said
to me: 'This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your abode.' 1 raised
up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two
companions said to me, 'That palace is yours.' I said to them, 'May Allah
bless you both! Let me enter it.' They replied: 'As for now, you will not
enter it, but you will enter it.’ I said to them, 'I have seen many wonders
tonight. W hat does it all mean?' They replied, 'W e will inform you: As
for the first man you came upon whose head was being struck with the
rock, he is the symbol o f the one who studies the Qur'an and then
neither recites it nor acts on its orders and sleeps in neglect o f the
enjoined prayers. As for the man you came upon whose sides o f mouth,
nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol o f
the man who goes out o f his house in the m orning and tells a lie that
spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you
saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and
the adulteresses. And the man whom you saw swimming in the river
and given a stone to swallow is the consumer o f usury [Riba]. And the
man with an ugly appearance whom you saw near the fire kindling it
and going around it is Malik, the gatekeeper o f Hell. And the tall man
whom you saw in the garden is Abraham, and the children around him
are those children who die with al-Fitra [the Islamic Faith i.e natural
inclination].” In the narration o f al-Barqani, it states: “They are the ones
who were born upon the natural inclination.” The narrator added:
“Some Muslims asked the Prophet, ‘O Allah's Messenger! W hat about
the children o f pagans?’ The Prophet replied, ‘And also the children o f
pagans.’ The Prophet added, ‘My two companions added, 'The men you
saw who were half handsome and half ugly were those who had mixed
acts o f good with another that were bad, but Allah forgave them.’”

“Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea due to
w hat the hands o f people have earned so He may let them taste
part o f what they have done, perhaps they w ill return to
righteousness.” [Ar-Rum:4l]
Mujahid said: “If the oppressor is granted authority, he attempts to
commit oppression and corruption. Due to it, Allah withholds the rain
therein and destroys the crops and the animals, and Allah does not like
corruption.” Then he recited:

“Corruption has appeared throughout the land and the sea due to
w hat the hands o f people have earned.” [Ar-Rum:4l]
By Allah, it is not only in reference to your sea. Rather, it is every town
located nearby a sea. ‘Ikrimah said: “Corruption has appeared on the land
and the sea. I’m not only referring to your sea. Rather, every tow n near
water.”'

Qatada said: “As for the “land”, they are the people in the deserts and as
for the “sea”, they are the people o f the towns and the rural areas.”'
1 say: Allah has named the sweet water, ‘sea’. He said:
cA'ji dlijss Ijei

“He is the O ne W h o merged the tw o seas, one is palatable and
sweet and one salty and bitter.” [al-Furqan:53]
There is no sweet water that is stagnant or stationary on the face o f the
planet, the sweet waters are the flowing rivers. As for the sea that is
stationary, it is the salty waters, so Allah named all those communities
situated by the flowing waters with their name.
Ibn Zayd said: “Corruption has appeared throughout the land and
the sea.” [Ar-Rum] He said: “It is in reference to sins.”
I say: He meant that sins are the reason the appearance of corruption.
However, if he meant that the corruption that has appeared is the actual
sins, in which case “So He may let them taste” is in reference to the
consequences and the reason.
Based on the first understanding, the intended meaning behind the
corruption is the diminution, the evil and the pain that Allah decrees to
take place on the earth when the servants sin. Thus, every time they
commit a sin, Allah decrees a punishment on them. As some o f the Pious
Predecessors (Salaf) said: “Every time you commit a sin, Allah decrees
that a punishment befall you.”

W hat seems to be the more apparent meaning -an d Allah knows bestis that ‘corruption’ is in reference to the sins themselves and their
warranting factors, and this is made evident by the statement o f Allah:
of

**

“...s o He may let them taste part o f what they have d on e.” [ArRum:4l]
This is our condition, He has made us taste miniscule consequences of
our own actions, but had He made us taste the lull extent o f our actions,
He would not have left a single creature to exist on the face o f the planet.
Also from the effects on the earth o f disobeying Allah are the
occurrences wherein the earth swallows the creatures, earthquakes and
the eradication o f blessings. The Messenger passed by the dwellings o f
the nation o f Thamud, so he forbade his own nation from entering their
dwellings, drinking from their waters, collecting water from their wells
and even mixing the feed prepared for the camels with their water due
to the evil consequences o f sins on water.
Likewise, the evils consequences o f sins occur in the loss o f fruits and
other ills which appear in society. Al-Imam Ahmad mentioned in his
M usnad' within a narration that a H anzah was found in the treasuries of
Bani Umayah, which is a seed the size o f a date pip. It was inside a sack
that had written on it: “This used to grow during the era o f justice.”
Allah has decreed many o f these ills due the perpetrations o f sins by the
servants. I have been told by many o f the elders in the desert that they
were accustomed to extract much larger fruit and vegetation from the

1 2/296 [7949],

153

The Disease A n d The Cure

ground than there is now, and that many o f these ills that are currently
present were unknow n to them; in fact, they came to light recently.
As for the effects o f sin on the appearances and the rest o f the creation,
At-Tirmidh! collected a narration wherein the Messenger said: “Allah
created Adam, and his height was sixty cubits, and the creation has not
ceased shrinking until now .”1
W hen Allah cleanses the earth from the tyrants, the immoral and the
deceptive people, He then brings forth a righteous servant from the
lineage o f the Prophet’s household to fill the world with justice as it had
been filled with tyranny, combat the Jews and the Christians and
establish the religion that Allah sent His Messenger with. At that point,
the earth will give rise to its blessings and it will return to it prior state,
to the extent that a large number o f people shall be sufficed by eating
one pomegranate, and they can be shaded by its peel, a branch o f grapes
will fill the camels load, and the heavy camel will be enough o f a food
supply for a large number o f people. This is an outcome o f the earth
being purified o f sin and thus extracting its blessings bestowed upon it
by Allah that was once eradicated by sins and unbelief.
Undoubtedly, the punishments that Allah inflicted on the people have
effects that have remained on the earth awaiting whatever sins will
trigger them. These effects on the earth are remnants o f those sins that
warranted the punishments o f the previous nations, just as the sins
perpetrated now are from the effects o f the previous crimes. So Allah’s
perfect W isdom and Judgm ent are all in harmony, and the greater the
crime, the greater the punishment is, and the lesser the crime, the lesser

the punishment. It is in this manner that Allah will also judge amongst
His creation in the grave and after the resurrection.
Reflect over the condition o f the devil (Satan), his place and his abode.
W hen he drew close to the servant and overcame him, the blessings
were stripped o f his life, his actions, his statements and his sustenance.
And when the obedience to the devil exerted its effect on the land, the
blessings were consequently stripped from any area wherein there was
obedience to him in addition to his final abode o f the Hellfire wherein
nothing o f mercy or blessings exists.
From the punishments o f sin: T hey smother that burning flame that
is the sense o f honor w ithin the heart, that is the burning instinct in
his life for his own benefit that gives life to the rest o f the body. This
sense o f honor and its intensity expels any waste and dispraiseworthy
attributes just as a bellow chips away at the redundant layers on gold,
silver and other metals. The noblest people are the ones who possess the
strongest zeal and most intense sense o f honor for himself, his dearest
and the general masses.
Thus, the Prophet had the highest sense o f honor for his nation, and
Allah possesses perfect H onor as has been authenticated through the
narration collected in the Sahih o f al-Bukhari wherein the Messenger
said: “Do you w onder at Sa'd’s sense o f honor? Verily, I have more sense
o f honor than Sa d, and Allah has more H onor than me.”1
Also, in the Sahih o f al-B ukharr on the authority o f Aisha who said:
“The Messenger o f Allah^ said: ‘O nation o f M uhammad^! By Allah,

there is no one more jealous than Allah should a male or female slave o f
His commit adultery.’”
Also, in the Saliih o f al-Bukhari': “None has more sense o f honor than
Allah, and for this He has forbidden shameful sins whether committed
openly or secretly. None loves a valid excuse from His servants more
than Allah, thus He sent Messengers as bearers o f good news and
warders. None loves to be praised more than Allah does, and so He
Praises Himself.”
This is the epitome o f honor and benevolence and the pinnacle height
of perfection. Since many o f those whose sense o f honor intensifies into
extremities are led to swift retribution and punishment without room
for a pardoning or acceptance o f an apology, he may have an excuse,
but his extreme sense o f honor will not allow him to accept the excuse.
O n the other hand, many o f those who leniently accept an excuse are
led to do so by their lack o f a sense o f honor until they widen the scope
of excuses whereby an excuse that should not be considered an excuse is
taken as such, to the extent that many o f them use the excuse o f Divine
Decree. Both sides o f the spectrum are incorrect when used
unrestrictedly. It has been authenticated that the Prophet said: “Indeed,
there is a sense o f honor that is loved by Allah and a type that is hated
by Allah. The type that is hated is the one that is misplaced and
unnecessary.”2 As for the commendable sense o f honor, it is the one that
has been coupled with a pardon in that one exercises their sense o f honor
when appropriate and pardons at times when it is appropriate. W hoever
is like this is rightfully applauded.

The Disease A n d The Cure

Moreover, since Allah possesses every attribute o f perfection, He is the
most deserving o f praise, and nobody can truly fulfill His praises; He is
how He has praised and commended Himself.
The one who possesses this sense o f honor has an attribute that conforms
to one o f the attributes o f Allah, and whoever possesses an attribute that
conforms to an attribute from the attributes o f Allah, that attribute will
lead him by his reigns and guide him to a devotion to Allah, draw the
person nearer to Allah, closer to His mercy and renders him as one of
the beloved ones to Him. Allah is Merciful and loves the merciful, He is
Generous and loves the generous, Knows all and loves the people o f
knowledge, He is Strong and loves the strong believer whilst he is more
beloved to Him than the weaker believer, He is Shy and loves those who
are shy, He is Beautiful in every aspect and loves those who beautify
themselves, W itr (One) and loves a l-W itr.
If there were not any other punishment for sins other than that they
afford an individual with the opposing attributes and deny him from
being described with them, it would have sufficed as a punishment. As
the passing thought transforms itself into a whisper, and the whisper
turns into a desire, the desire strengthens into determination and
conviction and then it becomes an action before it becomes an
inseparable trait and a deep rooted and firm characteristic. At which
point, ridding oneself o f it becomes an improbability as much as any
other characteristic that is part o f an individual’s personality.
W hat is meant here is that the more the association with sins
strengthens, the more it removes any sense o f honor for himself, his
family or the general people from the heart. It could even weaken in the
heart so much that the individual no longer condemns the condemnable,
whether it be from himself or someone else. If he has reached this low,
he has entered the realm o f destruction.

157

The Disease A n d The Cure

However, many o f them do not restrict themselves to a lack o f
condemnation, instead, they glorify immorality and oppression and
other vile acts, they beautify it, invite to it, encourage it and pursue it.
Thus, the day n th 1 is the vilest creature and Paradise has been prohibited
from him. The same applies to the one who legitimizes oppression and
tyranny towards others and glorifies it. Take heed and look what a lack
o f condemnation and sense o f honor consists of!
This indicates to you that the root o f this religion is having a sense o f
condemnation for evil (ghirah), and so whoever does not have ghirah,
lacks in his religion. This sense o f condemnation protects the heart, and
subsequently the limbs are protected consequently repelling all evil and
lewdness or immorality. An absence o f this feeling o f condemnation for
evil kills the heart; thus, killing the limbs and not having any shield
against evil. The similitude o f ghirah in the heart is that o f a particular
force that repels and combats illnesses as the immune system o f the body
does. If this force disappears, the illness finds an acceptant place to settle
without being faced with any repellent; thus, it firmly positions itself
causing destruction. It is also similar to the horns o f a water buffalo
which it uses to protect itself and its offspring, if they snap, the predator
covets it even more because the horns are no longer a method o f
protection.
From the punishments o f sins is the withdrawal o f shyness, which
is the essence o f the life o f the heart and the origin o f all good. Its absence

is an absence o f all good. Al-BukharT1 collected a narration wherein the
Prophet said: “All o f shyness is good.” He also said: “O ne o f the sayings
o f the early Prophecies which has reached the people is: If you do not
feel ashamed [do not have shyness] do whatever you like.”2
There are two explanations to the above narration as mentioned below:
One: It takes the context o f a threat and a warning. The meaning:
W hoever does not have shyness will do as they please from the various
vile acts, as the force that urges one to leave off the sin is shyness, so if
there is an absence o f shyness to prevent a person from vile acts, he will
fall into them. This is the explanation o f Abu Ubaid.
Second: In reference to the action itself, if you are not shy o f Allah, then
perform it. However, it is still obligatory to leave anything that makes
you shy before Allah. This is the explanation o f al-Imam Ahmad from
the narration o f Ibn Hani.
Based on the first explanation, it is a threat similar to the statement of
Allah:

“D o as you please,” [Fussilat:40]
And based on the second explanation, it does not am ount to a threat.
If it is asked: Is there a way to understand it in harmony with both
explanations? I say: No, and they cannot be combined due to their

o n th e a u th o rity o f A b u M as ud.

159

The Disease A nd The Cure

conflicting content. However, accepting one of them would constitute
a consideration o f the other.
The intended meaning here is that sins weaken a person’s shyness which
may remove itself entirely, he may reach a depth whereby he no longer
cares that the people know of his evil actions or see them. In fact, many
of them may inform others o f their lowly condition and the evil that he
perpetrates. His detachment from any shyness motivates him to do so. If
a servant reaches this condition, there seldom remains any expectation
for his rectification, as it has been said about such a situation:
I I Iblis (Sal an) secs his lace — he welcomes and says: I Inwe redeemed the
one who will not succeed.

The word H a ya ’ (shyness) is extracted from the word al-hayat (life). A lyhayth (rainfall) is also known as Haya due to the life it brings to the
ground, the plants and the animals. Likewise, shyness is the route
through which you gain a life in this world and the next, and whoever
does not have any shyness is dead in this life and wretched in the
Hereafter. There is correlation from all angles between sins, a lack of
shyness and a lack o f condemnation for evil. Each one of them attracts
the other and avidly seeks it out. W hoever has a shyness that prevents
him from enacting the sin, Allah will be shy to punish him on the day
the servant meets Him, but whoever is not ashamed o f sinning, Allah
shall not be shy to establish His punishment on him.
Also, among the punishments for sins is: They w eaken the veneration
and glory o f the Lord in an individual’s heart. It also w eakens his
reverence o f his Lord. This is inevitable w hether a person wishes
it or not. Had the Lord been revered in an individual’s heart and exalted,
he would not have been audacious enough to sin. It may also be the case
that the deluded one has been deceived to say: “I am led to sin out o f the
positive hope in my Lord and my eager expectation o f His pardon, not
the weak glorification o f Him I possess in my heart.” This is a severe
160

The Disease A n d The Cure

contradiction o f oneself, as the mighty stature and Majesty o f Allah in a
person’s heart and the high regard for His prohibitions will act as a
barrier between him and the sins. Those who are audacious enough to
sin have not observed the full right o f Allah, and how can the one who
disparages His commands and prohibitions perform the full right o f
Allah, glorify Him, extol Him and hope in Him? This is from the
furthest impossibilities and clearest forms o f falsehood!
It is sufficient as a punishment that the glory o f Allah and His
prohibitions vanish from his heart and His right becomes diminished in
his actions. Also, a portion o f the punishment is that the esteem that the
people held o f him will be removed by Allah from the hearts o f the
people, he becomes insignificant to them and they begin to demean him
just as Allah’s commands became insignificant to him and he belittled
them. The people’s love towards a person will be determined in
accordance to his love for Allah. The degree o f fear the people have of
him will also be determined according to his ow n fear o f Allah and the
degree o f veneration he has for Allah will determine the peoples regard
for him.
How can one violate the prohibitions o f Allah and await the people to
not violate him?
How can the right o f Allah be insignificant to him and not have the
people degrade him?
How can he belittle the magnitude o f the sins and not be belittled by
the creation?
Allah has indicated this in His Book amongst the punishment o f sins and
made their figureheads fall back into error for what they earned, veiled
their hearts, sealed them with the sins, abandoned them as they forgot
Him, made them insignificant as they disregarded Him and wasted them

161

The Disease A n d The Cure

as they squandered His laws. Thus, Allah said along the context o f the
creature’s prostration:

“W hoever Allah humiliates - for him there is no other granter o f
honor,” [al-Hajj:18], when they demeaned the prostration to Him,
belittled it and refused to perform it, He humiliated them and there was
no one else to grant them honor after He had disgraced them. W ho
could possibly honor the one whom Allah has humiliated? O r who can
humiliate the one whom Allah has honored?
Also, from the punishments o f sin is: They cause Allah to abandon
the servant, forsake him and leave him to his and Satan’s ow n
devices. Therein is a destruction that is seldom recovered from.
Allah says:

“O you w ho have believed, fear Allah. And let every soul look to
w hat it has put forth for tom orrow - and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah
know s all o f w hat you do. And do not be like those w ho forgot
Allah, so He made them forget themselves, those are the defiantly
disobedient.” [al-Hashr:18-19]
He commanded to fear Him and prohibited that any of His believing
servants resemble those whom He ascribed as those who forgot Allah.
He also mentioned that He punished the one who abandoned this fear
in that He made him forget himself, i.e., He made him forget the things
that are o f benefit to himself, the things that will cause his salvation, and
the things that warrant the eternal bliss and absolute pleasure, jo y and
162

The Disease A n d The Cure

bounties. He made him forget all this as a recompense for forgetting His
Lord’s Greatness, the fear one should have o f Him and the establishment
o f His commands. You will find the sinner negligent o f his ow n welfare,
squandering it as Allah has sealed his heart from remembering Him. This
individual has adhered to his ow n desires and his affair is ever in neglect.
Neglect in the welfare o f his worldly and afterlife affairs and neglect in
his eternal joy, in exchange for the lowest possible pleasures, as if it is a
summer cloud or an imaginary vision!
Dreams of the slumber or like a fading shadow — Surely, the intelligent one,
by this will never be conned

From the fiercest punishments is that o f a person forgetting himself,
disregarding it and squandering its share of piety to Allah, defrauding it
by trading it for a cheap price and in exchange for humiliation. He
wastes his connection with the O ne he cannot do without, nor replace
in exchange for things that can be easily replaced or exchanged.
Every thing, if you squander it there is a replacement — B ut not for A llah if
ever you squander his religion

Allah may award a compensation for anything except Himself, he
suffices for all things whilst none other than Him can suffice. He can
deny the creation anything whilst nothing is denied for Him. He can
protect from everything, but nothing can be protected from Him. Then
how can a servant ever do away with the obedience to the O ne W ho
possesses this stature for even a blink o f an eye?
From the punishments o f sin is: They expel a person from the realm
o f Ihsan, and they deny an individual the reward o f the Muhsinln.
If this Ihsan is absorbed into the heart, it obstructs a person from
com mitting sin because the one who worships Allah as ifhe can see Him
has only reached such a stage due to the overwhelming remembrance,
love, fear and hope he has for Allah in his heart, wherein it is as ifhe sees

163

The Disease A n d The Cure

Him. It is that state that comes between a person and his urge to sin, let
alone perpetrating the sin itself. So if he exits the realm o f Ihsati, he loses
out on an elite and righteous companionship, a pleasant life and
complete bliss.
If Allah desires good for an individual, He approves o f his status within
the realm o f the believers; however, if the individual commits a sin that
removes him from this realm -as mentioned by the Prophet: “The
fornicator is not a believer at the mom ent he is com mitting fornication,
the alcohol drinker is not a believer at the mom ent he is drinking
alcohol, the thief is not a believer at the mom ent he is stealing, and the
looter is not a believer when he is looting and people are looking on. So
beware, beware! Yet the opportunity for repentance remains there.”' it expels him from the level o f Imdn (faith), the individual loses out on a
companionship alongside the believers and the perfect defense that Allah
affords them as Allah defends the believers. He also squanders all the
good that Allah has assigned for the believers in His Book as a
recompense for faith, which is approximately one-hundred traits, each
o f which being better than the worldly life and whatever is in it.
Amongst these traits is the tremendous reward, Allah says:

“And Allah will grant the believers a tremendous reward.” [A nNisa:146]
Another trait is the protection and defense from the evils and harms o f
this life and the next:

them, the same ones whom we have been ordered to ask for the
guidance to their straight path seventeen times daily [referring to the
number o f obligatory units o f prayer one must perform everyday in
opening chapter o f the Q ur an].
Also, from the traits is that the Q u r’an is guidance and a cure for them.

The Disease A n d The Cure

“Say, ‘It is, for those w ho believe, a guidance and a cure’, and those
w h o do not believe - in their ears is a deafness and it is a blindness
to them , as if they are sum m oned from a distant place [they fail to
understand].” [Fussilat:44]
Nonetheless, faith is the cause that attracts all that is good and every
good in this life or the next is as a result of belief, whilst every evil in this
life and the next is as a result o f non-belief. Thus, how can anyone deem
it so insignificant to perpetrate something that will expel them from the
boundary o f lm dn (faith) and allow this action to be a barrier? However,
he is not expelled from the boundary o f being a Muslim, but if he persists
upon this manner o f sinning, it is feared that he will be afflicted with the
covering over his heart and exit the fold o f Islam entirely. Due to this,
the Pious Predecessors (Salaf) felt intense fear, as some of them would
say: “You fear the sins, and I fear disbelief [falling into it]!”
From the punishments for sin is: T hey w eaken the drive o f the heart
towards Allah and the Hereafter, or they hinder it or cease the
journey in totality, not allowing an individual to proceed towards Allah
even one step. This is if they do not cause a person to deteriorate
backwards! The sin conceals the desired destination, ceases the traveler
and sets the one in pursuit back. The heart traverses to its Lord using its
strength, and if it falls ill due to sins, this strength that drives it forward
is diminished. If it completely ceases, he becomes cut off from Allah in
a manner that is seldom recovered from. Allah’s aid is sought.
Thus, a sin either kills the heart or strikes a perilous illness into it, or at
the very least inevitably weakens its strength until it becomes
accustomed to the eight things that the Prophet sought refuge from.
They are: W orry and sorrow, incapacity and laziness, cowardice and
167

The Disease A n d The Cure

miserliness, debt and being overpowered by others.' Each two o f the
eight are associated together. W orry and sorrow are associated with one
another. If the undesirable occurrence on the heart pertains to an
anticipated event in the future, it evokes a feeling o f worry, but if it is
an event that has past, it evokes a feeling o f sorrow.
Incapacity and laziness are both associated together, if the servant’s
failure to fulfill the means to good and success is due to his inability, it is
incapacity, but if it is due to a lack of desire, then it is laziness.
Cowardice and miserliness are both associated together. If someone does
not wish to physically bring forth benefit, then it is cowardice, but if he
refuses to do so financially, then it is miserliness.
Debt and an overpowering from others are both in association. Being
overpowered and controlled by others, if it is deserved in its various
forms, it is from the hardships o f debt and an inability to fulfill it.
However, if it is done wrongfully, it is from the overpowering o f
oppressive men.
Hence, sins are one o f the most powerful means that attract these eight
things as well as drawing the difficulties o f severe calamities, having an
evil end, a bad fate and being on the receiving end o f the malicious joy
and gloating of your enemies. And they are from the main reasons for a
cessation in receiving the blessings o f Allah, deterioration in wellbeing,
as sudden calamity and His anger.
From the punishments o f sin: They rem ove blessings and cause an
affliction o f trials. N o blessing is removed from a servant unless a sin
is perpetrated, and no trial afflicts unless a sin is perpetrated. As Ali bin

Abi Talib said: “N o calamity descends w ithout sin, and no calamity is
raised w ithout repentance.” Allah said:

pc—s C , \J»j

“W hatever calamity has befallen you, it is from w hat your hands
have gained, and He pardons m u ch .” [al-Shura:30]
Allah also said:

“That is because Allah w ill never change a blessing that He has
blessed upon a people until they change them selves.” [al-Anfal:53]
Allah informed that He shall never change a blessing that He has blessed
anyone with unless the person changes his ow n condition, such as
exchanging the obedience o f Allah for disobeying Him, having
gratitude to being ungrateful and exchanging the reasons that gain His
pleasure for those that attract His anger. If he changes, his state is
changed as a recompense and equal measure, and your Lord never
oppresses anyone. If an individual exchanges sins for obedience,
consequently, Allah exchanges his punishment for wellbeing and his
humiliation to honor.
Allah said:

169

“Indeed, Allah does not change the state o f a people until they
change w hat is w ith in them selves, and if Allah w ants evil for a
people there can be no defense against H im and there is not for
them besides H im any ally.” [Ar-R’a d :ll]
Also, in some o f the divine Q udsi narrations that have been reported, He
said: “By My M ight and Majesty, none o f my servants shall be upon a
condition that 1 love, then change to a condition that I hate except that
I will treat him as he dislikes. None o f My servants shall be upon a
condition that I hate and then changes to a condition that I like except
that I treat him in a manner he loves after treating him in a manner he
dislikes.”
The poet said it fittingly:
If you are experiencing blessings, look after them — Indeed the sins remove
the blessings
R id them with the obedience of the Lord by the servant — The Lord of the
servants is sw ift to afflict with a calamity
Beware of oppression as much as possible — oppression of the servants is
severely detrimental
Journey with your heart amongst the people — to see the remnants of those
who oppressed
These are their dwellings that remain after them — testimony against them
without doubt
N othing was more harmful to them — than oppression, it is that broke them
H ow much of the gardens have they lost out on, and — palaces and other
things that were hard on them

The Disease A m i The Cure

They reached the fire and lost the bliss — and what they gained was once
like a dream

Likewise, from the punishments: The apprehension and fright that
Allah places in the heart o f the sinner, thus you always find him
apprehensive and scared. Obedience to Allah is His mighty fortress that
secures an individual in this life and the next from all punishments ifhe
enters it, and whoever leaves its boundaries shall be surrounded by perils
from every side. W hoever fears Allah will have their fears turned to
safety, but whoever disobeys Him shall have his feeling o f safety turned
into fright. You do not find the sinner in a state other than as if his heart
is between the wings of a bird. If the wind sways the door, he says: “I
have been summoned,” ifh e hears footsteps, he senses the horror that it
may be the warner of his worst fears. He deems every cry to be against
him and every evil to be creeping towards him. However, whoever fears
Allah, He grants him security from everything, but whoever does not
fear Allah, He makes him fear everything.
It is what A llah decreed amongst the people ever since they were created —
that fear a)id crimes are a couple

From its punishments is: Sins cause a strong feeling o f desolation
w ithin the heart. You find a sinner desolate with himself, with his Lord
and with the creation, and the more the sins multiply, the stronger the
feeling o f desolation becomes. The bitterest life is the life o f the desolate,
and the most pleasant life is that o f those who feel solace. If the
intellectual one ponders and measures between the pleasure o f a sin and
its consequences and the fear and desolation, he will realize how bad his
ow n condition is and how great his deception has been since he has sold
the solace o f obedience, its sanctuary, and its sweetness for the desolation
o f sins and what they necessitate from the feeling o f apprehension.
If sins have caused you desolation — leave them if you wish and find solace

171

The Disease A n d The Cure

The secret in all this is that obedience brings a nearness to the Lord. And
the more this obedience increases, the closer one becomes to his Lord.
Sins distance a servant from their Lord, and the more the sins increase,
the stronger the feeling o f desolation becomes. This is why you notice
a distance between an individual and his foe due to the distance that is
between them, but if was close to him, he would find a comfort and
affinity to the other person even if he was physically distant to him.
The reason for this desolation is the veil, and the more this veil thickens,
the greater this feeling intensifies. Hence, heedlessness causes this feeling
and sins cause it even more, and more so polytheism and disbelief. You
will not find anyone who practices these misdeeds except that he is
overcome by this desolation in accordance to the gravity o f the sin, it
reaches his face, his heart consequently becoming desolate and
becoming distanced from others.
Also, amongst the punishments o f sins is: T hey divert the heart from
its w ellbeing and steadfastness to its illness and m isguidance. It will
continue to be affected with this ailment, unable to benefit from the
nourishment that gives the heart its life and wellbeing. Undoubtedly,
the effects o f sins on the heart are like the effects o f ailments on the body.
In fact, sins are the ailments o f the heart and its illness, and there is no
other remedy apart from relieving oneself from them.
In addition, the ones who righteously traverse on their journey towards
Allah are in agreement that the hearts do not achieve their desired
destination until they reach their Supreme Master, but it does not reach
its Supreme Master unless it is sound and healthy, and it can not be sound
and healthy unless its ailment is remedied. All o f this is not achieved
without the struggle and opposition against the whims and desires o f the
soul. Its desires are its very illness, and the cure is opposing such desires.
If the illness roots itself, it annihilates or comes painstakingly close to
doing so.
172

The Disease A n d The Cure

Just as the one who forbids himself from whims and desires will attain
Paradise as his final abode. The same applies to his heart in this life, a
worldly existence that is incomparable to anything o f this life in any
way. Moreover, the difference between the tw o is like the difference
between the abode o f this worldly life and the bounties o f the Hereafter.
However, this is a matter that only those whose hearts have experienced
both scenarios can truly believe.
So do not assume that the statement o f Allah:

“Indeed, the righteous w ill be in pleasure. And indeed the w icked
w ill be in the Hellfire” [al-Infitar:13-14] is restricted to the bounties
o f the Hereafter and the Hellfire in the afterlife; rather, it refers to all
three abodes the person will go through, i.e., the abode o f the worldly
life, the abode o f the grave, and the permanent abode in the Hereafter.
All abodes will contain a party experiencing bounties and a party
experiencing the torment. So is there any bliss other than the bliss o f the
heart? And is there any punishment other than the punishment on the
heart? W hich punishment is more severe than fear, worry, sorry, a
tightness in the heart, an aversion o f the heart from Allah and the
Hereafter, a connection with other than Allah, a non-relationship with
Allah and scattered thoughts in every valley? Anything that you devote
yourself to or love other than Allah [in a devotion and love one should
direct to Allah] will be an affliction o f torm ent against you.
Anyone w ho devotes themselves to other than Allah is tormented
through it three times. In this life he is tormented by it before it even
reaches him; if it reaches him, he will be torm ented by it at that time, as
he will fear losing it along with whatever he has gained through it as
well as the disturbance and annoyance and the various conflicts he shall
receive as a result o f it. If he loses this thing, his self-torment intensifies
173

The Disease A n d The Cure

as a result. These are three consequential punishments in this life. As for
the life in the grave, it is a torm ent that can be associated with the pain
o f a distant departure with no return, a pain one feels when one realizes
the bliss they have squandered by being preoccupied with its conflicting
actions, a pain o f the veil between you and Allah, the pain o f grief that
tears through the insides. Hence, worry, despair and sorrow all have the
same effect on the body as the vermin and the worms have on the corpse.
In fact, their influence on the soul is permanent and continuous until
Allah returns it back to its corpse. At which point, the torm ent excels
into something more disastrous and bitter.
So what is this in comparison to the bliss o f the one whose heart is
excited and galvanized with jo y in attraction to their Lord, with a
yearning desire to meet Him, finding pleasure in loving Him and a
tranquil feeling in remembering Him? To the extent some o f them
exclaim at the time of death: “Joy!”
Others have said: “If the people o f Paradise experience a similar
condition to ours, they are undoubtedly in a pleasant life!”
Others say: “How destitute the people o f this world are, they left it and
never tasted the pleasantries o f life within it, and they never tasted its
greatest pleasure.”
Others have said: “If the kings and the offspring o f the kings knew the
feelings we experience, they would have fought us for it with their
swords.”
Someone else said: “Indeed, in this life there is a paradise. W hoever does
not enter it, will not enter the Paradise o f the Hereafter.”
O ’ you who has sold the most valuable opportunity for the cheapest price
and been absolutely defrauded in their transaction whilst he believes
otherwise. If you do not have sufficient experience to determine the
value o f the product, ask the evaluator.
174

The Disease A n d The Cure

How strange that you have merchandise that Allah will exchange with
you, its value is a permanent abode in Paradise and the one who was
assigned to ensure the transaction is the Messenger o f Allah sfe, yet you
have sold it for the most insignificant o f prices!
If this is the action of the servant himself — who then can honor him after
that

Allah says:
(JifleLLa

iih ol

y

& ^

iy t y ‘j

“W hoever Allah hum iliates, for him there is none to honor him ,
indeed Allah does as He w ills.” [al-Hajj:18]
From the punishments o f sin is: They blind the insight o f the heart,
extinguish its light, obstruct the path ol knowledge and veil the
necessities for guidance.
W hen al-Imam Malik met al-Imam al-Shafil and al-Imam Malik saw
his qualities, he said to him: “I see that Allah has placed a light in your
heart, so do not turn it off with the darkness o f sins.”
This light can continue to weaken and wither whilst the darkness o f sin
strengthens until the heart becomes like the dark night. Look how many
perils one can fall into whilst he does not see them, like a blind individual
who walks in the night on a path lull o f dangers and hazards. How great
is wellbeing and how quick is one to reach their own destruction!
Then this darkness spreads and spills over from the heart onto the limbs
touching the face with its darkness in proportion to its strength and
level. W hen the time o f death comes, this darkness appears in the grave
and fills it, as the Prophet said: “Indeed, these graves are filled with
darkness over their occupants, and Allah enlightens them through my

175

The Disease A n d The Cure

supplication for them.” 1 W hen the Day o f Resurrection arrives, the
people will be gathered, and the faces will be visibly black like lava. How
hideous a punishment it is that is immeasurable to any pleasure
experienced in the entire worldly life from its beginning to end! How
then can it even be compared to an individual’s portion o f time even if
it was filled with hardship and trouble w ithin a period that is like a
mom ent from a dream. Allah’s aid is sought.
Also, from the punishment o f sins is: They dem ean the soul, crush it,
force it into h iding and regard it w ith contem pt until it becomes
the smallest and most disregarded thing, just as obedience enhances,
purifies and enlarges it.
Allah said:

“The one w ho purifies it has succeeded. And he has failed w ho fills
it w ith sin. ” [Ash-Shams:9-10]
The meaning here is that the one who develops it and allows it to rise
by the obedience to Allah has succeeded, and the one who forced it into
hiding, demeans it and disregards it has failed.
The origin o f ‘tadsiyah’ as mentioned in the above verse is ‘concealing it.’
From this is the verse o f Allah:

“...h id e s it in the d ir t...” [An-Nahl:59]

1 C ollected by M uslim in the B ook of Funerals o n the authority o f Abu H urairah [956].

176

The Disease A n d The Cure

So the sinner hides his soul behind the sins, conceals its actual position,
he hides from the creation due to the evil o f what he does. He has been
crushed within himself, crushed in the sight o f Allah and crushed
amongst the creation.
Obedience and righteousness to Allah enlarges the soul and gives it
honor until it becomes the noblest thing, the largest, purest and highest.
Despite this, it remains insignificant to Allah. However, it is through
this insignificance that it has attained its honor, nobility and growth.
There has not been anything more effective in shrinking the soul than
the disobedience to Allah, and there has not been anything that enlarges
it and gives it its honor and loftiness more than the obedience o f Allah.
Also, from the punishments o f sin: The sinner is constantly under the
captivity o f his ow n devil, w ithin the prison o f his desires and locked
in the chains o f his whims. Thus, he is a captive who is imprisoned and
chained and there is no prisoner in a worst state o f imprisonment than
the one who has been captured by their worst enemy, or a prison tighter
than the prison o f desires or chains that are more difficult to escape from
than the chains o f one’s whims. How then can a heart that has been
captured, imprisoned and chained traverse to his Lord and the Hereafter?
How can he even take one step?
Therefore, the heart becomes entrapped by its own ills from every angle.
And the similitude o f the heart is that o f a bird, the higher it soars, the
further it distances itself from the hazards and the lower it flies, the more
it is surrounded by the hazards.
The narration states: “The devil is like the w olf against the hum an.’’Just
like the sheep that has no protection in the midst o f wolves is quick to
its demise, the same applies to the servant if Allah does not protect him
through his piety, the w olf is the predator and there is no alternative.
Piety is a preventative and a fortified shield between him and his wolf,
just as it is a preventative between him and the punishment in the
177

The Disease A n d The Cure

worldly life and the Hereafter. The closer the sheep is to the shepherd,
the safer it is from the w olf and the more it distances itself from the
shepherd, the closer it is to danger. Thus, the safest place tor the sheep is
near the shepherd and the w olf snatches the stray, which is the furthest
from the shepherd.
The root o f all this is the inevitability of the ills affecting the heart much
more quickly than they would the further the heart is from Allah, and
the closer the heart is to Allah, the further the ills from him are.
A withdrawal and distance from Allah is at varying levels, some more
severe than others. Heedlessness distances a person from Allah, and the
distancing o f sins are worse than that o f heedlessness, and the distance o f
innovation is worse than the distance o f sins and the distance of
hypocrisy and polytheism is the worst o f them all.
From the punishm ents is the demise o f the sinner’s status, stature
and dignity in the sight o f Allah and the sight if His creation. The
most noble creation in the sight o f Allah are the most pious ones, the
nearest to Him and the most obedient to Him. This nearness is
determined in accordance to the degree of piety. If one disobeys Him
and opposes His command, he falls in His determination, thus, dropping
his status amongst the people. Furthermore, if he is o f no significance to
the people, they treat him as such and lives a rotten existence amongst
them and a worthless mention of lowly status o f fallen stature without
honor, happiness or joy. Indeed, a worthless mention and a fall in one’s
status or stature carries an anxiety, a worry and sorrow along, with it an
absence of any joy or happiness. How can this pain ever be compared to
a pleasure one m ight momentarily experience from a sin had it not been
for the drunkenness o f one’s desire!
From the greatest blessings from Allah on His servants is to raise his
mention amongst the creation and raise his rank. Hence, He specified
His Prophets and Messengers with this over everyone else, as He said:
178

“And remember Our servants, Ibrahim [Abraham], Isaac, Y a’qub
[Jacob] - those o f strength and religious insight. Indeed, W e chose
them exclusively w ith the specific quality o f rem em bering the
Hereafter,” [Sad:45-46]
In other words, He specified them with a particular quality. It is a
beautiful mention that they will be mentioned with in this life. It is the
same reputation o f honor that Ibrahim asked for in his statement as
mentioned by Allah:

“And grant me a reputation o f honor am ong the

And He said to His Prophet M uhammad^:

“And W e raised your m en tion .” [Ash-Sharh:4]
The followers o f the Prophet all gain a portion o f this according to their
inherited portion o f obedience and adherence to them. All o f those who
disobey them miss out on this according to their opposition and sin.

179

The Disease A m i The Cure

From the punishments also is: Sins strip their perpetrator from any
names o f praise and honor in exchange for an ascription to all the
names o f dispraise and hum iliation. They strip him o f the name
believer, righteous, benevolent, pious, obedient, pious ally, devout,
reformer, worshipper, God fearing, repentant, pure, pleasant and the
likes.
He is then draped with names such as evil one, sinner, oppose, doer o f
evil, corrupt, despicable, the one discontent with, fornicator, thief,
murderer, liar, cheat, sodomite, traitor, cutter o f family ties and the likes.
These are the names o f disobedience, and as Allah says:
0

“W retched in the name o f disobedience after faith.” [alH ujurat:ll]
They are the names that warrant the wrath o f Allah, entry into the
Hellfire and a life o f debasement and lowliness. However, the
aforementioned names attract the pleasure o f A r-R alnnan, entry into
Paradise, and bring an honor to the one over the people.
If it were only for the entitlement of receiving theses names and all that
they necessitate as a punishment for your sin, it would have been a
sufficient deterrent for those with sound intellect. Also, had there not
been a reward for the obedience o f Allah other than gaining the success
to be called by these prestigious names, it would have been sufficient as
an order for the one with sound intellect. However, there is none to
prevent if Allah is the One giving, and there is no one who can give if
Allah is the one preventing, none other can draw one nearer if Allah has
distanced him and none can distance if Allah has drawn him near.

“W hoever Allah humiliates, for him there is none to honor him .”
[al—

Also, from the punishments o f sin is: It particularly affects a
deficiency in the mind. You will not come across any two people in
their right minds whereby one is obedient to Allah and the other is a
sinner except that the intellect o f the obedient one is more astute,
complete, more accurate, more sound minded, and he is predominantly
correct.
Thus, you find that the Q ur’an addresses those o f intellect, such as in His
statement:

“Fear Me O ’ people o f u n d erstan d in g...” [al-Baqarah:197], and:

“Fear Allah O ’ people o f understanding, those w ho b e lie v e ...”
[At-Talaq:10], and:

“O nly those o f remembrance have u n d erstan d in g...” [al—
Baqarah:269] - and the likes o f such verses are numerous.
How can one have understanding and an astute mind if they disobey
the O ne W hom they are w ithin His grasp, inside His kingdom, he
knows that He sees him at all times, yet one disobeys Him whilst he is
unhidden to Him. Furthermore, he uses His blessings over him for the
actions that anger Him and incites His wrath at all times, His curse, a
181

The Disease A nil The Cure

banishment and an abandonment and rejection, leaving the person to
himself and his enemy, thus falling in status before Him, being
prevented from His Mercy, Pleasure and Love or receiving the eye’s
delight o f seeing Him and being closer to Him or gazing at His Face
amongst the group o f believers to the other honorable rewards reserved
for the people o f obedience whilst on the other hand there being the
many other forms o f punishment reserved for the sinful ones?
W hat is the value o f a mind that prefers an hour, a day or a year of
illegitimate pleasure before it comes to an end as if it were a dream that
never was over the permanent bliss and ultimate success? Had it not been
for the mind that is the tool used to demonstrate the evidences, one
would have been equal to the insane; in fact, the insane may be in a
better position and receive harmless consequences. This is the case from
this perspective.
As for its effects in the waning o f the mind in one’s livelihood, had it not
been for the combined participation in this deficiency amongst
everyone, the obedient one would have realized the deficiency o f mind
o f the sinner, but the calamity (sin) is widespread and insanity is o f
different variations.
How peculiar o f an affair it truly is! If the minds were sound, they would
have understood that the way to attain pleasure, joy, happiness and a
blissful existence is by pleasing the O ne W ho possesses all blessings, and
the pain and torm ent all comes as a result o f angering Him. In pleasing
Him, you receive your eyes delight, the joys o f the soul, the life o f the
heart, the pleasure o f one’s inner-self and the most pleasant bounties.
W hereby if a seed’s worth was measured against the luxuries o f this
world, they would not equate. In fact, if the heart obtains the slightest
portion, it would never settle for the pleasantries o f this world as an
alternative. Yet, he receives his pleasure from this life more than those
who indulge in it do, untainted in his portion o f luxury unlike the
182

The Disease A nd The Cure

indulgent ones who are affected by worry, depression, sorrow and
confrontations. Furthermore, the first individual may receive both
blessings in wait for two blessings even greater, and whatever pain he
may experience on route can be defined as Allah says:

“If you should be suffering - so are they suffering as you are

Truly, there is no other deity worthy o f worship except Allah. How
deficient is a mind that sells a pearl for dung, musk for waste and the
company alongside those whom Allah has blessed from the Prophets and
the truthful and the martyrs and the pious in exchange for the company
o f those whom Allah has become angry with, cursed, and prepared the
Hellfire for - what an evil destination!
From the severest punishments to sin: It imposes a cut in the
relationship betw een a servant and his Lord. If this censorship
happens, all the means o f good become severed whilst the means o f evil
become linked to him. W hat kind o f success, hope or life is it when the
routes to good have all been severed, and the connection between his
Master whom he can never be w ithout for even a blink o f an eye is cut,
whilst there is no other replacement, in addition to the means o f all evil
being connected to him, a unity between his own most vehement
enemy and finding himself under the persuasion o f his enemy whilst his
ally has abandoned him? A soul does not comprehend what this severing
o f ties constitutes from pain and different types o f torment!
Some o f the Pious Predecessors said: “1 see a servant positioned between
Allah and the Devil, if Allah abandons him, the Devil consequently

reach him.”

“And m ention, w hen W e said to the Angels, ‘Prostrate to Adam’
and they prostrated, except for Iblis (Satan). He was o f the Jinn
and departed from the com m and o f his Lord, then will you take
him and his descendants as allies other than Me w hile they are
enem ies to you?” [al-Kahf:50]
Allah says to His subjects: “1 have honored your father, raised his rank
and favored him above the rest. Then I ordered all o f my Angels to
prostrate before him in honor o f him and a display ol dignity. They
obeyed Me, but their enemy and his [enemy] refused my command and
detached himself from obeying Me. So how can it then be right to take
him and his descendants as allies instead o f Me, obeying him in My
disobedience, allying with him in displeasing Me, whilst he is the
greatest enemy to you? Thus, allying with my enemy when I have
ordered you to oppose him .”
W hoever allies the enemy o f the sovereign King becomes equal to the
enemy, as a true devotion and obedience can never be accomplished and
complete without an enmity to the enemy o f the one who should be
obeyed and the allying o f the righteous. As for your claim that you are
an ally to the King whilst you also befriend His enemy, this is impossible.
This would even be true if the enemy o f the sovereign King was not an
enemy to you, so how should the case be since the enemy is also an
actual enemy to you, and the enmity that is between you and him is
more fierce than the enmity between the sheep and the wolf?! Thus,
1S4

The Disease A n d The Cure

how can it ever be befitting for someone o f sound mind and
understanding to ally with their enemy, the enemy o f their ally and
master whom he has no other master other than Him?
Allah forewarned about the evil o f such a relationship, He said:

“They are enem ies to y o u ..
it by saying:

[al-Kahf:50] just as He warned against

it

e-

^

“He departed from the com m and o f his Lord.” [al-Kahf:50]
Through this, it becomes evident that his enmity to his Lord and to us
is a reason to have enmity against him. So why ally? W hy do this
exchange? How despicable o f an exchange it is by the wrongdoers!
This address from Allah consists o f a subtle and remarkable reprimand.
It is that 1 rivaled 11)1is (Satan) because he did not prostrate to your father
alongside My Angels; thus, my enmity to him was for you, yet the result
o f this is a truce between you and him!
Also, from the punishments o f sins is: T hey expunge the blessings o f
life, the blessings o f sustenance, the blessings o f know ledge, the
blessings o f actions and the blessings o f o n e’s obedience. In
summary, they expunge the blessings o f one’s religiousness and worldly
affairs. You will not find someone who suffers more from a lack ol
blessings in their life, his religiousness and worldly life than the one who
disobeys Allah. No blessing has ever been removed from the earth unless
the disobedience o f the Creator causes it. Allah said:

“If the people o f the towns believed and had piety, W e would open
the blessings from the heavens and the earth for them .” [alA raf:96]
Allah also said:
< § & ic ;U r j & L & jp i i j i i n i J 13

“If they had been steadfast on the straight path, W e would have
delivered fresh water to them ,” [al-Jinn:16] and an individual can be
denied their sustenance due to a sin they perpetrate.
In the Hadilh: “Indeed, JibrTl blew into my soul that no soul shall die
until it uses up its sustenance, so fear Allah and seek your provisions
lawfully, because you cannot attain what is with Allah through sins.”
Also: “Indeed, Allah has placed mercy and joy within contentment and
certitude and placed worry and sorrow within doubt and discontent.”
Another narration, which was collected by al-Imam Ahmad in his book
o f Az-Zuhd, has been previously mentioned: “I am Allah, if I am pleased,
I bestow blessings and My blessing have no end. However, if I am
displeased, I afflict a curse, and My curse reaches the seventh child.”
The vastness o f sustenance and actions are not determined by their
abundance and nor is a lengthy lifespan determined by the abundance
of months and years. Rather, the vastness in sustenance and a lifespan is
determined by the blessing contained within.
W e have also previously mentioned that one’s age signifies their lifespan,
and the one who turns away from Allah has no life and is preoccupied
by other than Him. In fact, the lives o f the animals are better than such
a person’s life because one’s life is through the life in his heart and soul,
but his heart does not have life unless it knows its Creator, loves Him,
1X6

The Disease A n d The Cure

worships Him alone, turns to Him in repentance, finds assurance in His
mention and solace in being close to Him. W hoever loses this life has
lost everything that is good, regardless how he is compensated for it.
There is nothing in this world that can replace that life; rather the world
and all its luxuries cannot replace it! Everything can be replaced if it is
lost except know ing Allah; if it disappears, it can never be replaced.
How can the one who is essentially destitute replace the O ne W ho is
never in need, the essentially incapable to the One W ho can do as He
wills, the dead for the O ne W ho never dies, the created for the Creator,
the one who is nothing and does not own anything for the One Whose
essence is that o f a perfect independent, life, existence and mercy? How
can you replace the One who owns the heavens and the earth for one
who does not own as much as a seed?
Undoubtedly, sins are a reason for the disappearance o f blessings in a
person’s sustenance or life because Satan has been assigned to the
perpetrator, he has authority over them, has surrounded them around
these quarters and its occupants. Anything that is in association with it
has a link to Satan; thus, it is void o f blessings. Hence, mentioning the
Name o f Allah has been legislated before eating, drinking, clothing
oneself, riding and sexual relations with a spouse due to the blessings
that are linked to the Name o f Allah and its banishment o f Satan,
therefore attaining blessings w ithout opposition.
Anything that is not fulfilled for the sake o f Allah has its blessings
revoked, it is the Lord who solely places the blessings; every blessing is
from Him and anything attributed to Him is blessed. His Speech is
blessed. His Messenger is blessed, His believing servant w ho instills good
amongst the creation is blessed, His sacred house is blessed, the region
o f al-Sham is a blessed land - He mentioned as much in six verses across
the Q ur’an. There is none that bestows the blessings other than Him,
and there is nothing blessed unless it is ascribed to Him, meaning:
187

The Disease A n d The Cure

[ascribed] to His love, worship and pleasure. Nonetheless, all is ascribed
to His Lordship. Anything He distanced from Himself - whether it is
individuals, statements or actions - are all void o f blessing w ithout any
good in them. And anything that is close to Him contains blessings in
accordance to their nearness to Allah.
The opposite o f blessings is the curse. So a land that Allah has cursed or
a person He has cursed or an action He has cursed would all be from the
furthest things from any good and blessings, along with anything
associated to it, or remotely connected to it, there would not be a
blessing in it. He cursed His enemy -Ib lis (Satan)- and made him the
most distant creature from Him, so anything associated to I hi is will be
touched by the curse o f Allah in accordance to his nearness and
association with Iblis.
Henceforth, the sinner is subject to the most extreme case o f being
devoid ot blessings in their life, sustenance, knowledge and actions.
Anytime that you disobeyed Allah with wealth or body or position or
action, it will be held against you and not in your favor. The only
portion ol one’s life, wealth, strength, status, knowledge and action that
he used in the obedience o f Allah will be to an advantage. Thus, you
find individuals who live in this world lor one hundred years or
thereabout, but their true life has not amounted to ten years, just as some
o f them may own tons o f sums o f gold and silver, yet their actual wealth
may not even amount to one thousand dirham. The same applies to status
and knowledge.
A t-T irm idhl1 reports a narration from the Prophet who said: “The
worldly life is cursed, and cursed is everything in it, except the

1 [2322]. Also collected bv Ibn Majah [4112].

188

The Disease A n d The Cure

remembrance o f Allah, and what is aligned with it, and the scholar and
the one in pursuit o f learning.”
In another narration reported from the Pious Predecessors, it states: “The
worldly life is cursed, cursed is everything within it, except what is for
Allah.”
This is were the blessings are, in particular. Allah’s aid is sought.
Also, from the punishments o f sin: They cause their perpetrator to be
lowered to the low ly ones after he once had the qualities o f being
from the elite, as Allah has created his creatures into two categories:
those o f a low position, and those o f a high position. He made the
highest abode for those o f lofty actions and the lowest depths for those
o f lowly actions. He also made the people o f obedience at the highest
level in this world and the Hereafter, whilst the people o f disobedience
are the lowest in this life and the Hereafter. Just as He made the people
o f obedience the most noble o f His creatures to Him, He has also made
the people o f disobedience the most insignificant o f His creatures to
Him. H onor is for the first group whilst humiliation and inferiority for
the latter. It has been reported in the M usnad o f al-Imam A hm ad1on the
authority o f Abdullah bin Umar who narrated from the Prophet who
said: “Humiliation and inferiority has been set on the one who opposes
my command.”
Every time an individual performs a sin, he drops a level and will
continue to fall until he ends up in the lowest state. However, every time
he performs a good deed, he will be raised until he ends up in the highest
position. In a person’s life, he may live through some days wherein there
is a combination o f elevation in status from one perspective and descent
from another, and whichever perspective overwhelmingly dominates

1 2 /5 0 ,9 2 [5 1 1 5 ,5 6 6 7 ],

189

The Disease A n d The Cure

the other will determine a person’s position since the one who ascends
one hundred levels and descends one level is not equivalent to the one
who experiences the opposite.
However, one can be exposed to a grave error here. It is that an
individual could descend to such a vast extent exceeding that o f the
distance between the east and the west and the distance o f the heavens
and the earth yet not be able to fill this distance if he rose one thousand
levels in contrast to this one drop, as has been collected in the Sahih o f
al-BukharT who reported that the Prophet said: “Indeed the servant may
utter one word that he does not pay any attention to casting him into
the Hellfire further than the distance between the east and the west.”1
Regression is something that is inescapable from mankind. However,
there are some who regress due to a moment o f lapse in focus, so
whenever he breaks from this lapse he returns to his previous higher
level or to one that is even higher depending on his level of renewed
attentiveness.
From them are those whose descending motion goes towards a
permissible action that he does not intend to use to fulfill any obedience.
As for this one, whenever he returns to the obedience, his previous level
becomes restored but may not reach it and could also surpass it. He could
return to a higher level o f zeal than he previously had, could fall to being
even weaker or it could be restored to its initial level.
From them are those who traverse downwards into sin whether it be a
major sin or one lesser than that. Such an individual would require a

190

The Disease A n d The Cure

sincere repentance and a truthful return in order to be restored to his
initial state.
The scholars have differed: Does one return to the level he was
previously at after repentance based on the repentance eradicating any
trace o f the sin making it as if it never were, or does one not return to
their previous level based on the repentance only having an effect on the
punishment being exonerated? And as for the level that one was once at,
has it been squandered by him w ithout trace?
They argue: O n analysis, this individual was preoccupied with sin
during a time he could have been rising and his rise in comparison to
his previous actions are equivalent to a man who would use his wealth
to gain more wealth, and every time his wealth would increase, so would
his profits. But during the time o f sinning, he lost out on his profit.
However, ifh e were to continue the rise, he would do so from a lower
position whereas he was continuously rising before. Between the two is
a gulf in difference.
They have also said: the similitude o f which is that o f two men who are
ascending using a staircase that has no end whilst they are tied in
position, then one o f then descended downwards even if it is only one
step before resuming his ascent. In which case, the one who never
descended would inevitably be in a higher position.
Shaykh al-Islam passed his judgm ent on this issue between the two
parties adequately; he said: “Upon careful examination o f the matter, it
is that there are some who repent who reach a higher level than their
previous one, there are others who return to the previous state, and there
are others who do not recover.”1

1 M in h aj A s-S u n n a h [2/434].

191

The Disease A n d The Cure

I add: This depends on the strength and excellence o f the repentance
and to what extent the sin has brought about a humbleness, servitude,
repentance, caution and fear o f Allah. Also, the degree o f weeping out
o f awe, such factors could strengthen so much so that they drive a person
higher than their previous state and he could become better than he ever
was before his sin. In which case, the sin could have indirectly have been
a mercy, as it has expelled the illness o f self-amazement from him;
relieved him o f self-confidence in himself and his actions; placed his
neediness and helplessness before his Master; made him realize His
power; allowed him to bear testimony to his status and the dire need he
is in for his Master’s protection, His forgiveness and pardon; expelled
this onslaught against obedience from his heart; broken his nose from
ever sneering above the rest or becoming arrogant or deeming that he
is better than others; it has made him stop in front o f his Lord as a
w rongdoer and a sinner with his head hung low before his Lord - shy,
scared, deeming his obedience insignificant seeing the magnitude o f his
error. He has come to know about himself as having deficiency and
being unworthy whilst his Lord is singled out in Perfection, Praise and
Loyalty; as it has been penned in the lines o f poetry:
Favored is A llah with Loyalty and — Praise, whilst the blame returns to
man

He highly regards any blessing that he receives from Allah and deems
himself undeserving and does not see that he is worthy. He deems
himself to be deserving o f a greater hardship or calamity than the one
that befalls him, and despite this, he sees that Allah has been benevolent
to him as He has not punished him according to the scope o f his crime
nor even for half or the smallest portion o f it. His deserved punishment
would even be unbearable for the sturdy mountains, let alone a weak
and incapable servant.

192

The Disease A n d The Cure

Even if the sin is o f a lesser degree, confronting the Mightiest W ho is
unrivalled in His Might, the Greatest W ho is unrivalled in His
Greatness, the most Noble W ho is unrivalled in His Majesty, the most
Beautiful and the O ne W ho bestows every kind o f blessing big or small
in this way is from the most despicable, heinous and outrageous o f
things. Surely, the believer and non-believer frown upon confronting
anyone o f high status, high esteem or leaders o f men in this manner.
The vilest and least magnanimous people are those who confront such
people with vileness, so reflect on the affair since it is the Mighty One
W ho possesses the heavens and the earth, their sovereign King and the
only deity deserving o f worship in all o f the heavens and the earth.
If it had not been that His mercy overcame His anger and His
forgiveness overcame His punishment, the earth would have been
crushed due to those who present themselves to Him in an unbefitting
manner. Had it not been for His forgiveness, the heavens and the earth
would have been removed from their place due to the sins o f the
creatures. Allah said:

ILT>- jlS"
“Indeed, Allah holds the heavens and the earth, lest they cease.
And if they should cease, no one could hold them in place after
Him . Indeed, He is Forbearing and Forgiving.” [Fatir:4l]
Reflect over the conclusion o f the above verse with the two names alHallnt and al-Ghafnr. Hence, if it were not for His Forbearance with the

criminals and His forgiveness for the sinners, the entire heavens and the
earth would cease to remain in their place.
Allah has informed regarding some o f the disbelief His servant commits
in His statement:
193

The Disease A nd The Cure

“The heavens are on the verge o f rupturing from it and the earth
split open and the m ountains crumble in devastation.”
[Maryam:90]
Allah expelled the first two humans from Paradise for one mistake the
both o f them committed and a command they opposed Him in. He
made Iblis (Satan) accursed, banished him and expelled him from the
kingdom oi the heavens due to a sin he perpetrated and a command he
opposed. As for us -th e crowd o f feebleminded ones- our state is as it
has been said:
W e connect one sin to another and hope — for the levels of Paradise in an
everlasting bliss
Yet we know that He expelled -A d a m and H aw d- from — the highest
abode due to one sin

The intent here is that an individual can reach a better condition and a
higher level than his previous one after repenting. The misdeed can
weaken his zeal and cause his conviction to wane and afflict his heart
with an illness that the repentance is not strong enough to restore to his
original state. Nonetheless, an illness may disappear so that the wellbeing
returns to its normal state, thus returning the individual to their good
actions and their previous level. All o f the aforementioned is with
regards to one’s deterioration towards a sin. However, if a person’s
deterioration reaches a more severe level, such that it has an effect on the
essence o f a person’s faith - like having doubts or a distrust in creed or
hypocrisy in the religion- in this case, one has reached a stage that is
seldom returned from without a renewal o f faith from its foundation.
From the punishments o f sins is: They cause other created beings to
be audacious against the sinner. A sinner exposes himself to the harm

194

The Disease A ik ) The Cure

o f the Devil, his misguidance, whispers, scaremongering, attempts to
cause depression, causing forgetfulness o f the causes for wellbeing and
reminding about the causes o f harm. These devils grow in boldness
against an individual until they incite him to disobey Allah.
The devils o f mankind perform the same harmful tactics in his absence
and presence. A sinner’s family may also grow in insolence to harm him,
as well as his servants, his children, his neighbors and even the animals!
Some o f the Pious Predecessors would say: “W hen 1 disobey Allah, I
notice it in the insolence o f my wife and riding beast.” In addition, those
in authority will exercise their control over him, and if they were fair in
reprimanding, they would exert the penalty set by Allah on the person.
A sinner’s own soul may act insolently against him in that it intimidates
him and challenges him, whereby if he were to direct it to do good it
would neither comply nor submit, but instead it would drag him to his
demise, whether he likes it or not.
This is because obedience is the fortress provided by Allah. A fortress
once entered entails that the person is secure, but if he leaves this fortress,
he is left exposed to highway robbers and other than them, and the
degree o f perils faced by the soul is in accordance to the person’s audacity
in disobeying Allah. In this case, he has nothing to repel these harms
because the remembrance o f Allah, His obedience, giving in charity,
guiding the ignorant, enjoining the good and preventing vice are all
barriers o f defense for an individual that repel the illness in accordance
to their strength; however if this strength is lost, the illness overwhelms,
consequently causing devastation.
An individual must possess a repellent, because the causes for good and
evil are in a constant tussle with one another, and the Hnal outcome rests
with the stronger side, as previously mentioned. The more the side for
good deeds strengthens, the stronger the repellent is, as it is a matter o f
certainty that Allah defends those who have faith, and faith is comprised
195

The Disease A n d The Cure

o f speech and action, so the defense will be as strong as the strength o f
faith. Allah’s aid is sought.
From its punishments is that o n e’s self w ill betray him in the time
he needs it most. Surely, everyone is in need o f know ing what benefits
and harms him or her in this life and the next. The most knowledgeable
o f which are those who are most acquainted with the intricacies o f this
knowledge, and the strongest and most astute out o f them all is the one
who is able to control his soul’s desires and use it to his advantage and
dismiss whatever harms it. Here is where the knowhow, the ambitions
and levels o f the people differ. The most knowledgeable amongst them
are those who know the causes o f joy and despair best, and the most
guided are the ones who prefer joy to despair, just as the most foolish
ones are those who prefer the opposite.
Sins cause the betrayal o f the soul in its most required moments, such as
obtaining knowledge and valuing the noble, the lofty and the
permanent to the abject, the lowly and discontinuous. The sins have
concealed the full glory o f this knowledge from him and prevented him
from being occupied with the priorities and what is most beneficial for
him in this life and the Hereafter.
Thus, ifh e is struck with discomfort and needs to relieve himself from
it, his heart, soul and limbs fail him at that moment, and he becomes like
a man who has a sword that has withered with rust that has been placed
in its sheath so he is not drawn to use it, but his enemy appears to attempt
to kill him, so he places his hand on the sword handle to unsheathe it
and tries earnestly to pull it out, but it does not come out. He is
overcome by his enemy, and he triumphs over him.
Such is the heart, it rusts and becomes ruined from sins and becomes
contaminated with illness. Thus, if it wishes to combat the enemy, it
does not find anything to fight with, and an individual combats, fights

196

The Disease A n d The Cure

and proceeds with their heart and the limbs follow suit. So if the person
does not possess any strength to resist, what is expected to happen?!
The same applies to the soul, it loses its vigor through whims and sins
and weakens. This is as far as the reassured soul is concerned. However,
if it is the soul that commands with evil, it becomes more audacious and
intimidating. W henever the second one strengthens, the first one
weakens resulting in the final outcome in favor o f the soul that
commands with evil. It may even be the case that the reassured soul dies
a death that cannot be revived making him dead in this world, dead in
the life o f the grave and living an existence in the Hereafter that does
not benefit from. In fact, it is only a life that consists o f pain.
Here, it is evident that an individual is failed by his heart, tongue and
limbs from executing the things that are most beneficial to him when
he is afflicted with discomfort, hardship or a calamity. So his heart does
not incline to have reliance o f Allah, to return to Him, be focused in
devotion to Him or be in a state o f neediness o f Him. The tongue fails
to comply in remembering Him, and if he remembers Him in mention,
he does not harmonize between his tongue and heart, so the heart is
obstructed from complying with the tongue consequently affecting the
remembrance. But the heart and the tongue do not both become
obstructed together, so one may supplicate or mention Allah; however,
it may be through a heedless and distracted heart. If this individual seeks
that his limbs aid him through an act o f piety to repel the harm o f sin,
they do not submit to his will nor comply.
The above is all the effect o f sins and disobedience, just like the one who
has combatants to fight off the enemy but then disregards his combatants
and fails to use them, weakens them and loses communication with
them, but he then requires them to exert all their efforts to defend him
when the enemy attacks whilst there is not any strength!

197

The Disease A m i The Cure

Along with this, there is a matter even more pressing, more frightening
and more dangerous. It is that the heart and the tongue may fail to
respond during the stupor of death and the mom ent o f transfer from this
life onto the meeting with Allah. Perhaps, one may find themselves
unable to utter the testimony o f faith at that time, as the people have
witnessed many a time with those who have been afflicted with this at
the time of death. Some have even instructed others at that time to say:
La llaha Ilia Allah [There is no deity worthy o f worship except Allah],
instead, the person replied: “Ahh, Ahh! I cannot say it!”
It was said to someone else: “Say: Lii llaha Ilia Allah [There is no deity
worthy o f worship except Allah].” Instead, the person replied: “Shah,
Ruhh, I win,”1 then he passed away.
It was said to someone else: “Say: Lii llaha Ilia Allah [There is no deity
worthy o f worship except Allah].” Instead, the person replied:
“T h e one who was tired one day and said — how do I reach the hath of
M in jab.”2

It was said to someone else: “Say: Lii llaha Ilia A llah [There is no deity
worthy o f worship except Allah].” Instead he began to hum a melody
“Ta na na, tan tina,” until he died.
Someone else was also instructed to say the same, but said: “How will
what you say benefit me? There isn’t a sin that I haven’t com mitted,” he
then died w ithout uttering it.
Someone else was also instructed to say the same but said about himself:
“He doesn’t believe what you say,” then he died.

The Disease A n d The Cure

The same thing was instructed of someone else, so he said: “1 w ant to
say it, but my tongue is stopping me.”
Someone who witnessed the final moments o f some beggars informed
me that the beggar would say: “A penny for the sake o f Allah, a penny
for the sake o f Allah,” until he died.
1 was also informed by some o f the merchants when someone close to
them died and he was by his side, so they began to dictate “L<7 Ildha Ilia
A llah [There is no deity worthy o f worship except Allah]” to him.
Instead, he would say: “This piece is cheap, this is a good buy, this is
such and such,” until he died.
Subhan Allahl How numerous are the lessons witnessed from such

events! And that which has been concealed from them and prepared for
those who experienced this at their mom ent of death is even graver!
So if an individual has the presence of mind and strength and full
comprehension and yet allows the devil to control him, and uses him in
the disobedience o f Allah as he pleases, has sealed his heart from Allah,
denied his tongue from remembering Him and his limbs from acts o f
righteousness. W hat then would you think would happen when he loses
his strength, his heart and soul becomes distracted with the pain of the
stupor o f death, whilst the devil has mustered all his strength and resolve
gathering all he can to take advantage, and it would be the final actions
so his devil will be at his strongest against him and the person will be at
his weakest? W ho do you see being saved in this scenario?
At which point:

desires, captivated by its whims, dry tongued from His remembrance
and [possessing] limbs that do not obey Him and become occupied with
sin.
The fear o f an evil end has petrified the pious, and it is as if the evil and

Also, from the punishments o f sin: T hey blind the heart, if they have
not w eakened its insight at least. The matter o f the inevitable
weakening o f the heart has previously been mentioned, if the heart
becomes blind, it loses sight o f all guidance and its strength in executing
this guidance w ithin himself and in others depending on the level o f
weakness and strength.
The full integrity o f a person revolves around two foundations:
distinguishing truth from falsehood and valuing the truth over the
falsehood. The status o f the creation before Allah in this life and the
Hereafter vary depending on their differing in these two foundations.
They are the two qualities that Allah praised within His Prophets, He
said:

“And remember Our servants, Ibrahim, Ishaaq and Y a’qub - those
o f strength and religious v isio n .” [Sad:45]
This strength is the type that they used to actualize the truth, and the
vision is the insight in the religion. Thus, He described them with
uppermost comprehension o f the truth and complete actualization o f it.
The people have become divided in this regard into four categories: The
group mentioned above makes up the noblest group o f the creation and
the most honored by Allah.
201

The Disease A n d The Cure

The second group is the opposite o f them. No religious insight and no
strength in actualizing the truth. They are the biggest sore on the eye,
tough to bear on the soul, the illness to the heart, they make the place
feel constricted, cause the prices to soar and one does not gain anything
from the company apart from shame and disgrace! The third type are
those who possess religious insight and knowledge but are weak and
unable to actualize the truth or call to it. This is the state o f the weak
believer, whilst the strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah.
The fourth category consists o f those who have strength, zeal and
resolve but have weak religious insight, almost not even distinguishing
between the allies o f Allah and the allies o f Satan. He may deem every
black object to be a date, every white object to be a piece o f fat, the
swelling as fat and the beneficial medicine to be poison.
None o f these are fit for any leadership in the religion except those in
the first category. Allah said:
fl] l j 0J-C&f

A

“And W e made leaders from them w ho guide w ith Our com m and
w hen they were patient and in Our signs they had sure
con viction .” [As-Sajdah:24]
So Allah informs that they attained leadership in the religion through
patience and sure conviction.
This is the group that Allah exempts from the band o f losers, He made
an oath by time -w hich is the period in which both the winners and the
losers pursue their objectives- that whoever else will be from the losers.
He said:

20 2

The Disease A ml The Cure

“By time. Indeed, m ankind is in loss. Except those w ho believe,
do righteous good deeds, en join the truth and persist upon
patience.” [al-‘Asr:l-3]
Merely know ing the truth and being patient upon it was not enough,
until they counsel each other with it, guide towards it and encourage
with it.
Since everyone apart from the aforementioned are in loss, it becomes
known that sins and disobedience blind the heart’s insight m aking it
unable to adequately comprehend the truth; they also weaken its
strength and resolve, making it unable to exercise patience. Rather, it
could continually target the heart until its comprehension becomes
inverted just as the direction it takes along its journey takes the opposite
route, thus, deeming falsehood as truth, truth as falsehood, good as evil
and evil as good. It follows the w rong direction and returns from its
journey towards Allah and the pleasures o f the Hereafter to traverse
upon an alternative journey towards the place for the lowly souls that
have become satisfied with the worldly life, become reassured by it,
become heedless o f Allah and His signs and forsaken any preparation for
His meeting.
If there only happened to be this punishment for sins, it would be
enough o f a deterrent for a servant to leave them off. Allah’s aid is
sought.
O n the other hand, obedience illuminates the heart, clears it, strengthens
it, and grants it a resolve until it becomes like a clear mirror in its
cleanliness and purity, and it becomes filled with light. If the devil
approaches it, he is afflicted by its light the same way the devils who

203

The Disease A n d The Cure

attempt to steal the revelation from the heavens are banished by the
shooting stars. The devil will dread this heart like the w olf dreads the
lion, the person who possesses such a heart would be able to subdue this
devil until it collapses causing the other devils to gather and ask each
other “W hat is the matter with him?” It will be said: “He was struck by
a human, he has been afflicted by a look from a hum an.”
A look from a heart that is free and enlightened — the devil is on the verge
of being burnt with this light

Is this heart equal to a heart that has dark hopes, conflicting desires and
has been taken by the devil as a settlement and home? He greets him
when he awakens and says, “I have ransomed someone who will not be
successful in this life or the next!”
Your comrade in this life and in the afterlife thereafter — you are m y
companion in every place
If you were in the abode of torment, then you — and I together are in
torment and disgrace

“And w hoever is blinded from remembrance o f Ar-Rahman - W e
appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a com panion. And
indeed, the devils avert them from the way o f guidance w hile they
think they are guided. U ntil, w hen he com es to Us, he says, ‘Oh,
I w ish there was betw een m e and you the distance betw een the
east and w est’ - how wretched a com panion you are. And never
w ill it benefit you that day, after you have w ronged, you are
sharing in the punishm ent.” [Az-Zukhruf:36-39]
So Allah has informed that whoever is blind from His remembrance which is the Book He revealed to His Prophet- and averts from it, is
unable to see it, and has been denied the insight from understanding it,
reflecting over it and know ing it as Allah requests, in which case, Allah
will assign a devil to this person as a punishment for averting from His
Book. He will be his companion that is inseparable from him in every
situation, his ally and associate who is a wretched ally and a wretched
associate.
Tw o who suckle from the same mother, made an oath — from the worn!) we
shall never separate

Then Allah informed that the devil obstructs his companion and ally
from the path that leads to Him and His paradise, whilst this misguided
and obstructed individual believes he is on the path o f guidance, until
they both come on the day o f resurrection and one will say to the other:
“If only there was between me and you the distance between the east
and the west, how wretched o f a companion you were to me in the
worldly life! You misguided me from the guidance after it had reached

205

The Disease A n d The Cure

me, you obstructed me from the truth and diverted me until 1 reached
my demise, and you are a wretched companion to me today!”
And since it happens to be the case that one may feel slightly more
comfort and a lighter burden if the calamity is shared with others, Allah
informed that this does not apply to those who are jo in t in the torm ent
and that the companion shall not find rest or feel the least bit o fjo y as a
result o f his companions shared portion o f the punishment. It may be
the case that the calamities in the worldly life are eased if they are shared,
as al-Khansa’ said about her brother Sakhr when he was killed:
// it weren’t lor the many who are weeping around me — lor their brethren, I
would have killed myself
They do not cry lor m y brother as I do, but — I find solace through this
shared pain

However, Allah has prevented this method o f ease from ever occurring
amongst the people o f the Hellfire. He said:

“And never w ill it benefit you that day, after you have w ronged,
you are together in the punishm ent.” [Az-Zukhruf:39]
Also, from the punishments o f sin is: They are an aid for his ow n
enem y against him , and sins act as an army that strengthen the
enem y to inflict war on the individual.
This is because Allah has trialed mankind with an enemy that does not
leave him for even a blink o f an eye. The individual sleeps, yet the enemy
does not. The individual becomes distracted, yet the enemy does not.
He and his troops see you and you do not see them. This enemy exerts
his efforts in causing animosity at every possible opportunity and there
is not a ploy that he is able to use except that he uses it on an individual
206

The Disease A n d The Cure

whilst seeking the aid o f his fellow brethren from the jin n and the devils
amongst mankind. He lays the ropes for the trap w anting him to fall
into major calamities, stretches out the traps, sets the snares and digs the
ditches and says to his helpers: “There is your enemy, there he is, do not
let him escape you, do not allow his end be Paradise and yours be the
fire whilst his recompense is mercy and yours is the curse! You already
know what has amounted o f me from the disgrace, accruement and
banishment from the mercy o f Allah, all o f it was due to the human and
he was the cause. So exert as much effort as you can to make them
partners with us in this calamity, because we have already missed out on
partnering their righteous ones in Paradise!” Allah has foretold us all o f
this occurring from our enemy, and He has ordered us to be alert and
prepare accordingly.
Since Allah knew that the offspring o f Adam have been trialed with this
enemy, and that he has gained control over them, He provided the
offspring o f Adam with artillery to face him with and also granted the
devils artillery to use and outlined the struggle between the two
opposing sides in this life for the length o f its existence, which merely
amounts to a breath o f air in comparison to the Hereafter. He purchased
the lives and the property o f the believers in exchange for Paradise, they
combat for the sake o f Allah, so they are killed, and they kill, and Allah
informed that this is a certain promise made by Him in the noblest Books
- the Torah, the Injll and the Q u r’an. Then He informed that there is
no one more loyal and fulfilling o f their promises than He, then He
ordered them to rejoice over this trade deal that if anyone wanted to see
its worth should look at who the buyer is, and the value o f the
commodity that is being traded and under whose supervision and
control this transaction has taken place. W hich victory is greater than
this one? And which transaction is more profitable than this? Thereafter,
Allah confirmed this by saying:

“O you w ho have believed, shall I guide you to a transaction that
w ill save you from a painful punishm ent. It is that you believe in
Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause o f Allah w ith your
w ealth and your lives. That is best for you, if you only k n ow . He
w ill forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath
w hich rivers flow and pleasant dw ellings in gardens o f perpetual
residence, that is a great attainm ent. And you w ill obtain another
favor that you love - victory from Allah and an im m inent
conquest, and give good tidings to the believers.” [As-Saf:10-13]
Allah did not empower this enemy over His believing servant who is
His most beloved creature except that the struggle the servant goes
through for His sake is the most beloved action to Him, his nearest are
the highest in status and the closest to Him in devotion. Allah decreed
this conflict to identify His elite and the heart is the place that becomes
familiar with the Lord, His love, worship, sincerity to Him, reliance and
repentance. He assigned this conflict to them and aided them with
Angels who are always by his side protecting him from every side
successively replacing one another. They keep the individual firm footed
and command him to do good, urge him to persist upon this good and
relay the promise o f nobility from Allah to him, keep him patient and
say: “It is only patience for a short while, then ease forever.”
Then Allah grants them more troops to aid them from His revelation
and speech, He sent His messenger and revealed His book allowing the

208

The Disease A n d The Cure

servant to build even further on his strength, even more on the aid he
has already been provided and enhances his preparation even more.
In addition, He provided the person with a sound mind as an aid to him
and a means to reflect. He provided him with knowledge as a counsel
to him, faith to keep him resolute and as an aid and support, certainty in
order to identify the true reality as ifhe sees what Allah has promised his
party and dear allies for com m encing this struggle against His enemies.
Sound intellect organizes the troops, knowledge places the tactics o f war
in their appropriate position, faith makes one resolute and strengthens
insight whilst certitude urges one forward and carries him forward
through a truthful campaign.
Then Allah aids him through this struggle with an inner and outer
strength. Thus, He makes the eye at the forefront, the ear to hear
information, the tongue as an interpreter, the hands and feet are helpers
and declared that the Angels along with the ones holding the mighty
throne will seek forgiveness for him and Allah to protect him from all
harms and admit him into Paradise.
Allah Himself has assumed the responsibility o f defense o f His believers,
He has declared that they are His party, and the party o f Allah is the
victorious one. He said:

(U l ^ ^ -4 - 51 j
“Indeed, our soldiers w ill be the ones w h o overcom e.” [AsSaffat:173]
He also taught His servants how to undertake this struggle and
combined these instructions in four words:

209

The Disease A n d The Cure

“O you w ho have believed, be patient, and endure, and remain
stationed and fear Allah that you may be successful.” [alImran:200]
This struggle cannot be successfully fulfilled w ithout the
accomplishment o f these four words. O ne cannot be patient and
persevere without enduring the enemy, which is to confront him. Ifhe
endures the enemy, he becomes in need o f a further matter that is to
remain stationed in this position, and that is to guard the channel that
leads into the heart lest the enemy penetrates through, and guard the
channels o f the eye, the ear, the tongue, the stomach, the hands and the
feet. These are the openings that the enemy enters through to probe
within and corrupt whatever he can; thus, remaining stationed means
guarding these channels and not leaving them vacant or exposed and
allowing him to enter.
Here we have an example o f the Companions o f the Messenger of
Allah^ who are the best o f creation after the Prophets and Messengers,
and they were the most successful in protecting and guarding against
the devil, yet they abandoned the place that they were ordered to remain
stationed in during the battle o f Uhud, and the enemy encroached from
therein resulting in what happened.
The uniting factor and pillar that maintains all this is the piety towards
Allah, and piety does not flourish unless it stems from patience. So look
to your own self, and the meeting o f the two conflicting sides, and the
assembly o f both camps, and how you gain the upper hand at times and
how they gain it at other times.

210

The Disease A n d The Cure

The King o f U nbelief
The king o f unbelief has approached with his soldiers and entire camp,
but he has found the heart behind a fortress seated on the throne o f his
kingdom, his command passes amongst his allies and his troops surround
him and fight to defend him and his quarters, so the enemy could not
proceed unless they penetrate through his entourage and his soldiers.
Hence, they enquire about the most exceptional soldier he has and the
closest one to the king. It is replied: “The soul.” So the opposing king
will command his troops to force entry through it and its desires and
take particular notice o f the things it loves, then use that and arouse the
desire for it in him before carving this beloved feature into it, whether
he is asleep or awake. If it feels reassured and at ease, release the sharp
hooks and traps o f desires, then pull him in with them. If these desires
become engrossed in the heart, they become assistance for you against
him, and now you have conquered the channels o f the eyes, the ear, the
tongue, the mouth, the hands and legs. So remain stationed at these posts
as much as possible. W henever you enter through them into the heart,
he becomes a victim or a captive or riddled with injuries, so do not
vacate these channels and do not allow another brigade to enter through
them into the heart in order to remove you. However, if you are
defeated, then work tirelessly to weaken the other brigade from even
reaching the heart, so that even if it does reach the heart, it will be too
weak to have an effect.

211

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Devils and the Eye
If you manage to overpower these stations, then ensure that the eye is
not used for contemplation and reflection, and instead make it a means
for pleasure and idleness. Ifhe takes a look o f reflection, then he corrupts
it causing him to glimpse into heedlessness and desires because they are
closer to him, more attached to his soul and easier for him. There you
have it, the channel o f the eye, for indeed I have not corrupted the son
o f Adam with anything as effective as the eye, and from there you shall
gain your objective because I have not corrupted the son o f Adam with
anything as powerful as the sight. I plant the seed o f desires into his heart
through it, and then irrigate it with false hope, then I continue to
promise him and allure him to false hopes and strengthen his resolve in
that regard and lead him with the reigns o f whims and desires until he
becomes completely detached from being sin free.
Do not neglect this entry point, reap corruption as much as you can and
make it insignificant to him. Say to him: “W hat does one look that leads
you to remember your Creator, or the reflection over the glory o f His
creation and its beauty that has been created to for you to derive the
evidence o f His existence even am ount to? Allah did not create your
eyes for no reason, and He did not create this image for it to be hidden
from your sight.”
If you manage to triumph over someone o f little knowledge and
immoral mind, say to him: “This image is an appearance o f Allah and a
manifestation o f H im .” Then gradually incite him to the doctrine of
pantheism. Ifhe does not accept this, call him to the doctrine o f general
or specific immanendsm, and do not settle for any less because through
this, he shall become brethren to the Christians. Then, lead him to a
213

The Disease A n d The Cure

warped form o f chastity and conservation and an avid devotion to
worship and abstinence in the worldly life before hunting him down
with ignorance. These are my nearest successors and greatest soldiers. In
fact, I am from their soldiers and aids.

214

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Devils and the Ear
Thereafter, block the channel o f the ear from being penetrated or having
anything destroy your efforts. Strive in only allowing it to hear
falsehood, as it is easy on the soul and it beautifies it. Select the sweetest
phrases and the most mesmerizing to the mind, then merge it well with
all the soul’s whims and desires. Input an evil word, if you see that he is
responsive to it then add the rest. Every time you realize he deems
something to be good, bombard him with it.
Beware that any speech from the speech o f Allah, or the speech o f the
Messenger or the speech o f any sincere advisor should enter through this
channel! But if you are overpowered in this regard and it does happen
to enter, dwell in between it and the correct understanding or the
opportunity to reflect or contemplate upon it or to take an admonition
from it. This is accomplished either by entering something conflicting,
or by portraying it as intimidating or daunting - and that it is a matter
that will dwell between a person and their soul - or that you are unable
to attain, and it is a heavy burden you cannot underestimate, or
something similar to this. O r by making it seem unworthy whilst one
should occupy themselves with something seemingly more important
and highly regarded amongst the people, more valuable to them, more
distinctive with a higher volume o f customers. As for the truth, it is
outdated and discarded, and the one who devotes himself to it is
exposing himself to enmity, but whatever is common amongst the
people is o f a higher priority, and words to this effect. Thus, subjecting
him to misguidance through every perspective whilst portraying the
truth in a manner he will dislike and be burdened with.

215

The Disease A nd The Cure

If you wish to truly realize this, look at their brethren from the man
devils and how they portray the enjoinment o f good and the
forbiddance o f evil as excessiveness, an illegitimate harassment to extract
people’s mistakes, exposing oneself to unbearable trials, causing
tribulation amongst the people and the likes. Whilst they present a
distorted understanding o f the Sunnah and the Attributes that Allah has
described Himself with and that His Messenger has described Him with
in a manner befitting His Majesty as an attempt to resemble Him
‘Tam thll’ to the creation and ascribe Him with humanization ‘TajsTm’
and comparisons ‘TakylP. They name the ‘Highness’ ot Allah above His
creation, His ascension above the throne and Him being separate to the
creation as ‘Tahayuz’ (restriction to a space), they refer to His decent to
the first heaven (in a manner that suits His Majesty) as ‘Taharuk and
Intiqal (movement and relocation).” They refer to any attribute He has
attributed to Himself such as The Hand or The Face as ‘A’daa (limbs)
and Jawarih (body parts)’ and any action as ‘Hawadith’ (subject to
events) and the actions o f His Attributes as ‘A’rad’ (incidental attributes).
Then they arrive at the warped understanding o f negating whatever
Allah has ascribed Himself as by negating these concepts, and they
delude the ignorant and those o f weak insight that affirming the
Attributes that have been mention in the Q u r’an and the Sunnah
necessitate this understanding, presenting this rejection in the false
image o f elevation and glorification.
All this whilst most o f the people are feebleminded, they accept
something via a particular term whilst rejecting it through another
wording! Allah says:

“And thus W e have made for every Prophet an enem y - devils
from m ankind and jin n inspiring to one another decorative
speech in delusion.” [al-An am: 112]
Allah named it “decorative speech” yet it is falsehood, but the
proponent o f this speech decorates and beautifies it as much as they can
before injecting it into the deluded persons ear waves, thus, he is
deceived. W hat is evidently clear here is that the devil has positioned
himself at the entry point o f the ear whereby he inserts anything that
harms and does not benefit the person and obstructs anything that
benefits him from entering. However, if something beneficial does enter
against the devil’s will, he endeavors to corrupt it.

217

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Devils and the Tongue
He goes on to say: Gather against the tongue now. Indeed, it is the
strongest channel and directly situated facing the king. So make the
speech that harms him become fluent upon it; and prevent it from
uttering any remembrance o f Allah, or any quest for forgiveness by
Allah, or recitation o f the Q u r’an, or delivering any sincere advice to His
servants or dispensing beneficial knowledge. You have been assigned
with two huge responsibilities pertaining to the tongue. Do not be
concerned with which one you execute [either one is good enough]:
The first: Speaking falsehood, as uttering falsehood is considered one o f

your brethren and from you strongest allies and helpers.
The second: Being silent about the truth, as the one w ho is silent about

the truth is also one o f your brethren, but he is without a tongue. As for
the first one, he is one o f your brethren but possesses a tongue. Perhaps
your second brother is even more advantageous to you. Have you not
heard the speech o f the advisor: “The one who speaks falsehood is a
devils that speaks, whilst the one silent about the truth is a devil without
a tongue.”
Remain positioned, remain positioned at the entry point o f this channel
lest he speak the truth or withhold from any falsehood. Beautify
speaking falsehood to him by any means and instill a fear into him to
ever speak the truth by any means.
Know, my children, that the opening o f the tongue is the channel I use
to destroy the offspring o f Adam, and I drag them with me on their faces
into the Hellfire, how numerous are my victims that have fallen to their

219

The Disease A nd The Cure

demise, and how numerous are the captives and casualties that I have
taken!
I counsel you with a piece o f advice, so memorize it well: if one o f you
pronounces something upon the tongue o f his brethren from the
humankind, whilst the other awaits on the tongue o f the listener
allowing the listening human to commend it, acclaim it and become
amazed by it, thus requesting that his brother repeats it.
Be aids to one another by any means against mankind, and invade them
from every door, and lay in wait for them on every path. Have you not
heard my oath that I made in the name o f their Lord wherein I said:

“Because You have put me in error, I w ill surely sit in wait for
them on Your straight path. T hen I will com e to them from before
them and on their right and on their left, and You will not find
most o f the grateful.” [al-A raf:16,17]
Do you not see that 1 have sat in waited on every path for the offspring
o f Adam, he does not escape one route except that he finds me on
another until I fulfill my need or at least some o f it. But their Prophet
has warned them o f this, he said to them: “The devil sits along the paths
o f the son of Adam. He sits waiting for him. He sits in the path to Islam,
and he says: Will you accept Islam, and leave your religion, and the
religion o f your forefathers? But he disobeys him and accepts Islam.
Then he sits waiting for him on the path to Islamic emigration, and he
says: Will you emigrate and leave behind your land and sky? But he
disobeys him and emigrates. Then he sits, waiting for him on the path
to Jihad, and he says: Will you fight in jihad when it will cost you your
life and your wealth? You will fight and be killed, and your wife will
220

The Disease A n d The Cure

remarry, and your wealth will be divided. But he disobeys him and fights
in Jihad. The Messenger o f Allah^ said: “W hoever does that, then he
has a right from Allah, the M ighty and Sublime, that He will admit him
to Paradise.”1
Just like so! Sit in wait for them on every path to good, if anyone of
them wishes to donate in charity, sit there and whisper to them: Will
you spend this money in charity, and become like the one who is asking,
on the same level? Have you not heard what I conveyed upon the
tongue o f a man who was asked for charity? He said, it is our wealth, if
we give it to you, we become like you.
Sit in wait for him on the path to the hajj pilgrimage and say to him: It
is a perilous and difficult journey, the one making it is exposed to death
and a loss o f wealth.
And sit in the path o f all good actions by driving them away from it and
mention the difficulties and obstacles. Then sit on the path o f sins and
decorate them to the offspring o f Adam and beautify them in their hearts
and make women the strongest aid for them in this cause. Enter the
channels through the ploy o f women, they are an excellent aid to you!
Thereafter, sit by the hands and the legs and prevent them from ever
holding onto anything that will harm you or walking toward in its
cause.
Know, that the biggest aid for you in maintaining control o f these
channels is reconciling with the soul that commands with evil. Help it,
use it to your advantage, give it assistance and gain assistance from it.
And be one with it in your war against the reassured righteous soul and
work tirelessly to break it and defeat its resolve, and there is no way to

1 C o lle c te d b y A n - N a s a l [3134], a l-Im a m A h m a d 3 /4 8 3 [1 5 958]. Ibn H ib b a n [4593].
al-B ukharT in A t-T a rik h [4 /1 8 7 -1 8 8 ].

221

The Disease A n d The Cure

do this other than cutting its supply. Thus, if its supply is cut, the supply
o f the soul that commands with evil is strengthened, it begins to comply
with its aids to draw the heart out o f its fortress, isolate it from its
kingdom and replace it with this soul. It will not enjoin anything other
than what you desire and love. It will not present anything that you
detest and will not oppose you in anything you direct it to. In fact, if
you direct it to something, it hastens to it.
However, if you sense that the heart is challenging for its kingdom and
you wish to be relieved o f this, enact a marital contract between it and
the soul, then decorate it, beautify it and present it in the best image a
bride can appear in. Then say to it: Taste the pleasures o f this bride, just
like you tasted the trials o f war and felt the injuries and combat strikes.
Now, compare between these pleasures o f reconciliation with the
bitterness o f that war, renounce the war because it is not a one-day
event. Rather, it is a war connected to death, and you become weak as a
consequence o f an ongoing war.
Now -m y children- seek assistance from two mighty soldiers that you
shall never be defeated alongside:
One o f them is heedlessness. Make the heart o f the offspring o f Adam
heedless o f Allah and the Hereafter in any way. You do not possess
anything more comprehensive in achieving your aim than that. Indeed,
if the heart becomes heedless o f Allah you gain a firmly affixed position
over it.
The second is the desires. Adorn them in their hearts and decorate them
to their sight. Assume the onslaught with these two soldiers, as you will
not have a more comprehensive tool against the offspring o f Adam than
these two. In addition, reinforce this heedlessness with whims and
desires, and reinforce the whims and desires with heedlessness. Now pair
up two heedless people and use them against the thoughtful and
conscious one, as one cannot defeat five because the two heedless people
22 2

The Disease A n d The Cure

have two devils by their side, that is four in total, and the devil o f the
thoughtful one is also with them.
Furthermore, if you see a group o f people congregating for something
that brings harm to you, such as the remembrance o f Allah or to study
His commands and prohibitions and His religion whilst you are unable
to separate them, then use the assistance o f their kind -th e hum an- draw
them close to them and cause chaos in their ranks that give way
separation.
In summary, prepare adequately for every situation. Enter to the
offspring o f the children o f Adam from the gateway o f their desires and
ill-intent, then help them in achieving them, and be efficient assistors in
his pursuit o f attaining them. If they have the command from Allah to
persevere with patience, endure it and remain guarded in front o f these
channels, then you must also persevere, you must endure and you must
hold your guard in front o f these channels and grasp your opportunity
at times o f desires and anger as you will not be able to hunt down the
offspring o f Adam at a better opportunity!
You must also know that some o f them have a weakness to the power
o f whims and desires whilst the influence o f anger is weaker to him in
this regard, so tread the method o f desires and leave the method o f anger.
Some o f them are weaker to the emotion o f anger, but do not forsake
the avenue o f desires at the same time, and do not undermine its channel,
because the one who cannot control themselves at a m om ent o f anger
will not control themselves when faced with desires. So couple between
his anger and his desires, and merge the two and entice him towards his
desires from the gateway o f anger, and entice him to anger from the
gateway o f desires. It is also imperative that you know that you do not
have a more comprehensive weapon than these two aforementioned
weapons. I caused the expulsion o f Adam and Hawa from the heavens
through desires, and I instilled the enmity amongst their offspring using
223

The Disease A n d The Cure

anger. And through that, I split their ties o f kinship, spilt their blood
through which one o f the children o f Adam killed his brother.
Know that anger is a live coal in the heart o f the son o f Adam, and the
desires is a fire that rages from his heart. This fire can only be
extinguished with water, prayer, remembrance o f Allah and Takhir. So
be ever so cautious to allow the offspring o f Adam to approach the
ablution or the prayer at his times o f anger and desires, even though that
is the command o f their Prophet to them, as he said: “Indeed, anger is a
live coal in the heart o f the offspring o f Adam. Have you not seen the
way his eyes become red and his cheeks inflate? Thus, whoever senses
this should perform ablution.” 1 He also said to them: “Fire is
extinguished with water.”2
Allah has instructed them to gain their assistance from patience and
prayer, so obstruct them from it, make them forget it and gain assistance
from their own desires and anger. The most far-reaching weaponry you
have against them is the most damaging: Heedlessness and obeying
desires. O n the other hand, their most powerful weaponry against you
and their sturdiest fortress is the remembrance o f Allah and the
disobedience o f their own desires. Thus, if you come across a man who
opposes his sinful desires, flee from his shadow and do not go near him.
The intended meaning here is that sins and any act o f disobedience are
a weapon and a reinforcement that a servant affords his own enemy with
and assists them against his own self with, so they combat him with his
own weaponry and he aligns with them against himself. This is the
pinnacle o f all ignorance.

The enemies do not reach the ignorant one — as much as the ignorant reaches
himselj

From the most peculiar things is that the servant endeavors with all his
efforts to disgrace himself whilst he claims that he is honoring it. He
endeavors to deny it the highest and most noble gains whilst he claims
to be working towards its ultimate prosperity. He exerts all efforts to
debase, belittle and conceal his soul from any good whilst he claims that
he is uplifting it and enhancing it! Some o f the Pious Predecessors (Salaf)
would mention in their sermons: “How many disgrace themselves whilst
he claims he is honoring it, how many humiliate themselves whilst they
claim they are dignifying it, how many belittle themselves while
claiming to enhance it, how many waste themselves whilst claiming that
they are concerned with its rights. It is sufficient as ignorance that
someone aligns themselves with their enemy against themselves.
Through his actions, he reaches a point that his enemy could not reach
alone.” Allah’s aid is sought.

Sins Make a Person Forget Him self or Herself
A m ongst the punishm ents o f sins is that they cause servants to
forget themselves, and if an individual forgets himself, he neglects,
corrupts and destroy himself.
If it is ever asked: H ow can someone forget himself or herself? And if
one forgets oneself, what then is remembered? And what is the meaning
o f forgetting oneself?
The response to this is: Yes, someone can utterly forget themselves.
Allah said:

“D o not be like those w ho forgot Allah, so He made them forget
them selves. They are the corrupt ones.” [al-Hashr:19]
So when they forgot their Lord, He abandoned them and made them
forget themselves, as He said:

“They forgot Allah, so He abandoned them .” [At-Tawbah:67]
Here, Allah inflicts tw o punishments, the first: He abandoned them, and
the second: He made them forget themselves. It is to mean that He
disregarded, left of, abandoned and ignored. Tragedy is closer to such
an individual than a hand is to the mouth! As for making him forget his
own self, it is to make him forget any lofty recompense and the reasons
for bliss, success, uprightness and whatever contributes to a person’s

227

The Disease A n d The Cure

perfection. He makes him forget all o f that, so it never crosses his mind,
nor does he note it as a point to remember, nor does he divert his
attention to it to have some desire for it. It does not come to mind for
him to ever aim for it or value it.
In addition, He makes the individual forget his own faults, deficiencies
and wrongs, so removing them and rectifying his situation would never
come to mind.
He also makes the individual forget the ailments o f his self, his heart and
its pains. Thus, he never feels the need to remedy his own heart nor
endeavor to remove its ailments and illnesses that lead to corruption and
ultimate destruction. This person is ill and has been debilitated with this
illness, and it is leading him to his own doom whilst he is unaware o f his
illness, and neither does it ever cross his mind to seek a remedy for it.
This is from the most extreme forms o f general and specific
punishments. W hich punishment can be worse than disregarding your
own self and squandering it, forgetting the matters that benefit it,
forgetting its illness and cure and the reasons for its joy, success,
uprightness and its eternal life in the permanent abode o f bliss?
It would be clear to whoever thoroughly reflects on this point that most
o f mankind have truly forgotten themselves, squandered themselves and
wasted their reward with Allah. They sold it for a measly price in an
inequitable transaction. This will all become clear to them at the time o f
death and will be made evidently clear on the day o f (their) deprivation,
on the day it will become clear to the servant that he has been tricked in
the contract that he enacted with himself in this life and the transaction
he partook in for his afterlife. Indeed, every individual commences a
transaction in this life for the Hereafter.
The losers are those who believe that they are the recipients o f the profits
and numerous gains. They bought this life and its luxuries and pleasures
in exchange for the Hereafter and its luxuries, so they exhausted their
228

The Disease A n d The Cure

pleasures in their worldly life and enjoyed them, became satisfied with
them and reassured therewith. Their endeavors were in pursuit o f them.
They sold, bought and traded. They sold something forthcoming
(afterlife) for something instant (worldly life), something delayed for
something immediate, they sold the unseen for something materialistic
whilst declaring that this is something o f firm resolve. O ne o f them may
even say:
Take what you see and leave something you heard about

They say: How can I forfeit something that is present and witnessed in
this life for something that is unseen and has been postponed in another
realm other than this one? Fused along with this is a weakness in faith,
the strong driving force o f desires, the love o f the worldly life and the
resemblance o f its people.
Most o f mankind are involved in this failing transaction that Allah
mentioned:

“Those are the ones w ho have bought the life o f this world for the

“Their transaction has bought no profit, nor were they guided.”
[al-Baqarah:16].
Thus, when the day o f deprivation arrives, the fraud o f this transaction
will become evidently clear to them and their souls will be broken with
anguish therein.
229

The Disease A n d The Cure

As for those who have profited, they sold something that was fading in
exchange for something permanent, something menial for something
precious, something worthless for something imperial, and they
declared: W hat is the value o f this worldly life, from its ultimate
beginning to end for us to sell our portion o f reward with Allah and the
Hereafter for it? How would it then be when we consider the short
period o f time that an individual exists in it, which is like a m om ent in
a dream and has no comparison in the least with a permanent abode?

This is the reality o f the worldly life when brought forth on the Day o f

worldly life and that they have a final abode to travel to, which is the
eternal life, they deemed that it would be from the greatest injustices to
trade an eternal abode for a fading life. Thus, they commenced a
transaction o f intellectuals and were not deceived by the transactions o f
the foolish ones, so their profits flourished on the Day ofjudgm ent along
with the am ount they purchased. Every individual in this life is involved
in selling, purchasing and trading, everyone starts their day as a vendor

[As-Saf: 10-11]
The intent here is that sins cause a person to forget their portion from
this profitable transaction and preoccupy him with a failing transaction,
that is sufficient in itself as a punishment. And Allah’s aid is sought.
From the punishment o f sins is: T hey rem ove any present blessings
and prevent the forthcom ing ones. They remove the present
blessings and obstruct any forthcom ing blessings. Indeed, the blessings
o f Allah are not preserved with anything more effective than acts o f
obedience to Him, and the needed blessings are not gained by anything
more effective than acts o f obedience to Him. W hat is with Allah can
only be gained through obedience.
Allah has decreed a cause and a preventative for everything. A cause that
will attract and a preventative that will deny. He made the reason that
attains His blessings his obedience, and the preventatives that are an
obstruction to them are sins. Thus, if He desires the preservation o f
blessings over His servants, He inspires them to maintain them through
using them in obedience to Him. However, if He wants to remove them
from an individual, He abandons him until the person disobeys Him
through them.
W hat is simply startling is that even though an individual may know
this, and witness it upon himself and others and hear o f the news o f those
whom he has not seen and how their blessings were stripped from them

233

The Disease A n d The Cure

due to the sins, yet one continues to delve into the disobedience o f Allah
as if he has exclusivity from this generality or that it is an event that
occurs with others and reaches everyone in mankind except him!
W hat ignorance is more striking than this? W hat oppression to the soul
is more exceeding than this?
Truly, the judgm ent is for Allah al-Alee, al-K ablr to make.
From the punishments o f sins is: T hey distance a servant from their
ally, and the most beneficial one to them amongst the creatures, the
most sincere one towards him and the one whose closeness brings
happiness, it is the Angel that has been assigned to you. Through sins,
his enemy - who is the most deceitful and most harmful o f creatures to
him - draws closer, and he is the devil. Inevitably, if an individual
disobeys Allah, his Angel distances itself to the proportion o f the sin to
the extent it can distance itself a lengthy am ount due to a lie the
individual has told.
In some narrations that have been mentioned: “If an individual lies, the
Angel distances itself a mile away from the stench.”' If this is the distance
an Angel flees to as a result o f one lie, what then would be the distance
from him due to something more severe and vile?
Some o f the Pious Predecessors would say: “If a male mounts another
male, the earth cries out to Allah, the Angels flee towards their Lord and
complain o f the enormity o f what they have seen.”
Some o f the Pious Predecessors also said: “W hen a person wakes up from
their sleep, they are approached by an Angel and a devil. If the individual
remembers Allah, makes Takhir (utters Allah Akbar), Tahm id (praises
Allah ‘Alhamdullilah’) and Tahlil (utters the testimony o f faith ‘La Ilaha
Ilia Allah’), the Angel banishes the devil and protects the individual. But
1 C ollected by A t-Tirm idhT [1972],

234

The Disease A n d The Cure

if he begins his m orning in another manner, the Angel disappears, and
the devil assumes charge o f the individual.
The Angel will continue to draw closer and closer to an individual until
it gains dominance, authority and obedience. So the Angels are in
support o f this person in their life, during death and in resurrection, as
Allah said:

but receive glad tidings o f Paradise w hich you were promised. W e
are your allies in the worldly life and the Hereafter.’” [Fussilat:3031]
If the Angel allies with an individual, then he has been allied with the
purest creation, the most beneficial and the most loyal. Thus, the Angel
gives him firm resolve, strength in the heart and support. Allah said:

“W h en your Lord inspired the angels, ‘I am w ith you, so

The Angel also says to the believer at the m om ent o f death, “Do not
fear, do not grieve and embrace glad tidings o f that which makes you
happy.” The Angel keeps him firm with the strong word at a time when
the individual needs it most in this life, at the mom ent o f death and in
the grave during the questioning.

235

The Disease A n d The Cure

There is no companionship better for the servant than that of the Angels.
He is his companion during the times he is awake, asleep, during his life,
at the point o f death, in his grave and his solace during his moments o f
desolation; he is his companion at times o f seclusion and the one who
shares his secrets. The Angel fights away his enemy, defends him, aids
him against the enemy, promises the individual with good, gives him
glad tidings and encourages him to testify the truth, as it has been
reported in a narration that has been transmitted as attributed to the
Prophet and otherwise; “Indeed, the Angel gathers around the heart o f
the offspring o f Adam, and the devil gathers around the heart. The
gathering o f the Angel is to promise good and testify the promise, and
the gathering o f the devil is to promise evil and deny the truth .”1
If the Angel draws exceedingly close to the servant, he begins to utter
words on the tongue o f this person and inspires the individual to say
what is good. But if he distances from the individual, the devil comes
close and utters words upon the tongue o f the individual and places false
testimony and vile speech through him until you find one o f them
uttering the words o f an Angel whilst the other utter the words o f a
devil.
The narration states: “Reassurance resonates on the tongue o f Um ar .”2
O ne would hear a good word from someone and say: Only an Angel
would place this word on your tongue. He would hear the contrary and
say: Only a devil would place this word on your tongue. The Angel
plants the truth in the heart and reveals it on the tongue whilst the devil
plants evil on the tongue and makes it run along the tongue.

From the punishments o f sins: The distancing o f the ally w hose
closeness, an adjacency and an alliance to him w hich contains his
bliss. Equally, it is from the punishments o f sin for the enemy to draw
near, whose presence and alliance only attracts wretchedness, doom and
corruption. The Angel will even defend and protect an individual as well
as reply on his behalf is someone is discourteous and foul-m outhed to
him, just as it occurred when two men had a dispute in front o f the
Prophet. O ne o f the men was insulting the other whilst the man on the
receiving end remained quiet before he uttered one word in response,
at which point the Prophet stood up and left. So the man said to the
Prophet: “O Messenger o f Allah
when 1 partly responded you left.”
He replied: “The Angel was defending you, but when you responded,
the devil took its place, and 1 would never have remained.” 1
Furthermore, if a person makes a supplication for his or her fellow
Muslim in their absence, the Angel says ‘A m in ’and says: “And unto you
the same,” and if an individual concludes the recitation o f the opening
chapter o f the Q u r’an, the Angel says 'A m in ’ to the supplication within.
if a monotheistic believer and adherent follower o f the Sunnah o f the
Prophet performs a sin, the Angels that hold the mighty Throne seek
forgiveness for it on his behalf, and if he sleeps with an unbroken
ablution, an Angel spends the night in his hair.
The Angel alongside a believer will respond on his behalf, fight for him,
defend him, teach him, give him firmness in faith and support him. So
it is not appropriate to treat the neighbor badly, or exceed in harming
him, or banishing him or distancing him because he is an individual’s
guest and neighbor. Since honoring the guests from mankind and
treating the neighbor well are all traits o f faith w ithin a person, what

1 C ollected by Abu D aw ud [4896].

237

The Disease A n d The Cure

then do you think the case would be regarding the most noble o f guests
and the best neighbor and most faithful o f them?
If an individual harms the Angel with the various forms o f sins,
oppression and immoralities, it will supplicate against him, and say:
“Allah, do not reward him with any good,” just as it would supplicate
for him if he honored it through obedience to Allah and benevolence.
Some o f the Companions would say: “W ith you is someone who is
inseparable to you, so be shy from them and honor them .”1 There is no
one more lowly than the one who does not shy from someone o f
nobility and high status, nor value him or respect him has misbehaved.
Allah has indicated this meaning in his statement:
jlj
“Indeed, appointed over you are keepers, N oble and recording.”
[al-Infitar: 10-11]
Meaning: Be shy from these noble keepers, honor them, and value them
in such regard that you would be embarrassed that they see you doing
something you would be embarrassed to do in front o f someone like
yourselves.
The same things that annoy mankind annoy the Angels. So if an
individual receives harm from the one who acts immorally and sins in
front o f them, even if he were to participate in the action, to what extent
do you deem the harm would be for the noble and recording Angels?
From the punishments o f sin is: T hey attract the causes for an
individual’s devastation in his worldly and afterlife.

1 Refer to A t-T irm idhi on the auth o rity o f A bdullah bin U m ar [2800].

238

The Disease A n d The Cure

Sins are illness. W henever they intensify and become engrained, they
inevitably kill a person. Just as the body will not be healthy w ithout the
appropriate nutrition that preserves its strength and an outlet to release
the unwanted mixtures and waste that would cause damage if they are
combined and overwhelm, and an immune system that obstructs the
intake o f anything detrimental or something that may bring harm,
likewise the heart; its life is not complete w ithout the nourishment o f
faith and righteous actions to preserve its strength, and a sincere
repentance that is an outlet for any harmful and unw orthy substances,
along with regimented diet that preserves sound health and dismisses
anything that infringes on that and it is to abandon anything that
conflicts with sound wellbeing. Taqwd (piety) is a word that
encompasses all o f the above; whatever deficiency there is in Taqwd shall
be reflected in the above three aspects.
If this has become clear to you, you will realize that sins contradict the
above three aspects. They attract the harmful substances; they necessitate
a mixture o f harmful substances to affect the regime and prevent any
outlet o f a sincere repentance.
Look at a body suffering with ailments whereby the harmful substances
have accumulated along with the components o f illness whilst he is
unable to rid himself o f them or prevent himself from receiving them,
how would his health be? The poet said it well:
Your body that you have protected with a diet — in fear of a sudden illness
It would have been better i f you sufficed — front sins in fear of the fire

Thus, whoever upholds their strength through observing the
commands, uses the preventative measures in avoiding any sins and
ridding himself o f any unwanted elements through sincere repentance
w ithout leaving any good except that he tried to achieve or any evil
except that he tried to avoid. And the aid is sought from Allah.

The Legislated Punishments for Crimes
If the previously mentioned punishments do not frighten you and you
find that they have not had any effect on your heart, then seek out your
heart in the Islamic punishments that Allah and His Messenger have
legislated for crimes, such as the amputation o f the hand for theft, or the
hand and the foot highway robbery from anyone whose wealth and
blood has sanctity. Flogging for slandering someone who is chaste with
the accusation o f fornication, or the consumption o f alcohol. The
stoning for adultery, or the lesser punishment o f one hundred lashes and
banishment from his own land to a foreign one for the unmarried
fornicator. O r capital punishment for the act o f incest, or the rejection
o f the prayer, or the belief or utterance o f unbelief.
Reflect over the perfect W isdom o f Allah in incapacitating the limb that
was directly used to perform the crime. He disabled the hand and the
arm o f the highway robber, as they were the two limbs that he used in
the crime, but He did not establish the punishment o f the tongue with
regards to the one who accuses the chaste one o f fornication, as that
would be an exceedingly unfair punishment. Instead, He sufficed him
with a flogging that would cause pain across the body.
If it is said: W hy has not the limb that directly committed the fornication
been chastised? W e may respond from various perspectives:
The first: The harm that the limb would receive would exceed the harm
caused by the crime, as it consists o f a cessation to lineage and the person
being subject to fatality.
Secondly: The limb used to perform this crime is concealed and
severing it would not serve the purpose o f the punishment which is to
241

The Disease A n d The Cure

deter and admonish others from com mitting the same crime, as opposed
to the amputation o f the hand.
Thirdly: If one o f his hands is amputated, he still has another one to
compensate for it, as opposed to the private part.
Fourthly: The pleasure experienced through fornication is felt by the
entire body. Thus, it would only be befitting for the punishment to be
felt by the entire body, which is more appropriate than specifying the
punishment to part o f the body.
Hence, the legislated punishments have been prescribed to the most
adequate level, the most agreeable to the sound mind and the most
appropriate for the overall benefit.
The intent here is to define that the crimes and sins warrant punishments
that are divided into two categories that are either legislated in this life
(Shar'iyah ) or the Hereafter (Qadariyah ).

242

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Punishments o f Sin Are T w o Types
They are either ‘Shar'iyah ’, and they apply to the worldly life or
‘Qadariyah ’, which apply to the Hereafter. If the Shar'iyah types are
established, the Qadariyah types are lifted or lessened. However, the Lord
may seldom combine between both types o f punishments and establish
them on an individual, unless the punishment in this life has not been
established to an adequate level whereby the sin has not been eradicated
and it has not been enough to remove the illness.
However, if the one in the worldly life has failed to be established, the
punishment in the Hereafter may be applied, and it may be sterner than
the one an individual would have received in the worldly life, or it may
be lighter, but it will encompass many others, whereas the Shar'iyah
punishment in the worldly life is specific to the perpetrator. The Lord
will never decree a legislated punishment in this life on anyone other
than the perpetrator or those who aided and abetted. As for the
Qadariyah type in the Hereafter, it is both general and specific because
the sin only affects its perpetrator if it is concealed. However, it harms
the masses if it becomes overt and if the people witness evil and
collectively decide not to denounce it, they would be on the verge o f all
being engulfed by the punishment o f Allah.
W e have previously mentioned that Allah has legislated the punishments
within this life according to the scope o f the sin and the appeal it has
towards what is natural, and He divided it into three categories: capital
punishment, amputation and flogging. He declared the capital
punishment in line with blasphemy and anything equivalent to it or near
it such as adultery and sodomy, as this all desecrates the religions and
creeds and abolishes lineages and the nature o f mankind.
243

The Disease A n d The Cure

Al-Imam Ahmad said: “I do not know o f any sin after murder that is
worse than fornication.” The Imam derived a narration o f the Prophet
on the authority o f Abdullah bin Mas ud as proof for this, whereby he
said: “O Messenger o f Allah
what is the worst sin?' He said: ‘That you
make an equal to Allah, while it is He who created you.’ He said: ‘I said:
Then what?' He said: ‘That you kill your child fearing that he will eat

said: ‘That you commit adultery with your neighbor’s wife.’” Then
Allah revealed the verse:

“And those w ho do not invoke w ith Allah another deity, nor kill
the soul w hich Allah has forbidden, except by right and do not
com m it unlawful sexual intercourse.” [al-Furqan:68]'
In this particular piece o f revelation, the Prophet mentioned the highest
form of each sin so that his answer conforms to the question and answers
it satisfactorily. The questioner enquired about the worst sin, and so the
Prophet responded by informing him o f the worst type o f sin along with
the worst form within its type.
The worst form o f polytheism is to equate a partner to Allah when it is
He W ho created you.
The worst form o f murder is to kill your own child in the fear that they
will share your food and drink alongside you (in fear o f poverty).

The worst form o f unlawful sexual intercourse is to commit fornication
with your neighbor’s wife, as the evil o f this unlawful act accumulates
depending on the magnitude o f the honor and right that has been
violated. Thus, com m itting fornication with a woman who is married
carries a greater sin and punishment than com mitting the same act with
an unmarried woman. As it entails a violation o f the sanctity o f the
spouse, a corruption to the relationship, and an ascription o f a bloodline
that may not be from him and other than that from the aspects o f harm.
Therefore, it is a worse sin and crime than the fornication committed
with one who is unmarried. If the w om an’s spouse is a neighbor to the
one who perpetrated the crime, this sin is now accumulated to a further
sin o f the mistreatment o f the neighbor with the highest form o f harm
and evil towards the neighbor. The following statement o f the Prophet
has been authentically attributed to him in which he says: “He will not
enter Paradise, he whose neighbor is not secure from his wrongful
conduct .”1 There is not a more evil harm than com mitting intercourse
with someone else’s wife. Fornication committed one hundred times is
o f a lesser degree to Allah (without trivializing the matter) than
fornicating with a neighbor’s wife, and if the neighbor is the
perpetrator’s brother or relative, a further sin o f breaking the ties o f
kinship is added to the enormity o f the sin.
In addition, if the neighbor is absent in the fulfillment o f an act o f
obedience to Allah or performing the prayer, or in pursuit o f knowledge
or fighting in the cause o f Allah, the sin further magnifies to the extent
that the one who performed this vile act with the wife o f a man who is
on duty fighting in the cause o f Allah, he shall face him on the Day o f
Resurrection, and it will be announced: “Take as much as you want from
the sinner’s good deeds for yourself.” The Prophet said: “W hat do you

think ?”1 i.e., what do think he will leave from the good deeds? He has
been given authority to take whatever he wills on an occasion in which
he will be in dire need for even one good deed, in a time wherein the
father will not leave anything for his son, nor will a friend leave anything
for his friend from any rights that are due to them.
If the woman he has committed this act with is a relative, the sin o f
severing the ties o f kinship has added to its gravity and if the man himself
is also married to another woman, the sin is even far worse, and if he is
an elderly man who committed this sin, then the sin is even greater than
previously deemed. Undoubtedly, they are from the three types o f
people whom Allah shall not address on the Day o f Resurrection nor
purify, and they shall taste a painful torment.
Furthermore, if this act corresponds to a sacred month, or takes place in
a sacred land or during a significant and honorable time o f the day such
as the time for prayer, or the prescribed times o f response to the
supplications, the sin is considered more vile by Allah, and the offence is
multiplied.
According to the above, consider the wickedness o f sins and the
compounded repercussions o f sins and punishments from them. Allah’s
aid is sought.
Allah has legislated that the amputation o f the hand be a punishment for
the crime o f stealing wealth that has been safeguarded. He is unable to
obtain it hence he does so covertly by penetrating through walls and
climbing over gates. He is like a feline or a snake that approaches you
off-guard. Nonetheless, his crime does not am ount to murder, nor does

flogging deter it, so the best deterrent would be separating the body part
that the thief uses to embark on the crime.
He made flogging a reprimand for the crimes that spoil the minds and
violate the people’s honor by falsely accusing and maligning them o f
unlawful sexual intercourse. And so, the legislated punishments o f Allah
in this life are categorized in these three types just as the expiations
revolve around three types: Emancipation that is the highest, feeding
others and fasting. Allah also categorized the sins to be three types:
A category that warrants a penalty, and this category does not include
an expiatory act because o f the sufficiency o f the penalty.
Another category that does not carry a penalty, so there are acts o f
expiation one can perform. Such sins like performing sexual intercourse
with a spouse during the fast on a day in the month o f Ramadan, or
during Ihratn (whilst in the state o f Ihram during Hajj or ‘Umrah),
during a period o f Zihdr, for accidental causing o f death, violating an
oath and other actions.
There is a further category that does not require a legal punishment or
an act o f expiation, and it is two types:
One: The type wherein the deterrent is instilled within innate nature
such as eating excrement or consuming urine or blood.
Second: The type o f sin that has a lesser detrimental effect than the acts
that carry a penalty, such as casting a look at something forbidden,
kissing, touching, conversing or stealing some pennies and the like.
The expiations have been legislated in relation to three types o f sin:
One: An act that is principally lawful, but an unlawful act has
intervened, and thus the individual performs this act in an unlawful
manner, such as having intimacy with one’s spouse during Ihram on the
pilgrimage o f Hajj or ’Umrah or performing sexual intercourse with
247

The Disease A nd The Cure

one’s spouse during her menses, as opposed to the penetration through
the backside which is forbidden at all times. Hence, the attachment that
some o f the scholars o f jurisprudence have made between the two acts
is incorrect in this regard, because it has been made impermissible in all
its forms, and it is analogous to sodomy and consuming intoxicants.
Second: Vows or oaths made in Name o f the Allah or something made
unlawful by Allah (through a person’s oath) for someone, if someone
wishes to dissolve this oath, it can be done through expiation, and it has
been named ‘Tahilla’.
Third: The type that requires a compensatory measure, such as the
measures taken after accidental causing o f death, or accidental death
caused to hunted prey. Such are from the remedial compensatory
expiations. The first type mentioned above is a form o f chastisement,
and the second is to dissolve the oath.
A legislated penalty and reprimand will never be combined together as
a punishment to a sin. If the sin requires the establishment o f a penalty,
that is sufficient, or else the reprimand should suffice. Both are never
implemented together. Any sin that warrants a penalty will not carry an
expiation, and the opposite is also correct.
However, are both reprimand and acts o f expiation ever required for a
sin that does not carry a penalty? There are two points o f view in this
regard. It may apply to acts such as performing sexual intercourse with
your spouse during the state o f Ihratn or fasting, or with a menstruating
woman (spouse). If one were to say that expiation here applies, then it
could also be said that the perpetrator should be reprimanded for
violating the sanctity o f honor by performing this crime.
O n the other hand, it may also be said that there is no need for reprimand
due to the act o f expiation being sufficient, because it compensates for
the deficiency and eradicates it.

248

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Punishments o f the Hereafter Are Tw o
Types
A type that afflicts the hearts and the souls and another type that affects
the body and worldly possessions.
The type that affects the heart is further divided into two types:
One: A pain that the heart feels.
Two: Cutting the elements that give it its life and welfare, whereby if
they are cut away, the heart is affected with adverse effects.
The punishment on the heart is the more severe o f the two, and it is the
root for the punishment on the body. This particular punishment gains
strength until it seeps through onto the body just as the pains of the body
creep into the heart. W hen the soul is detached from the body, the two
affairs remain connected, and thereafter the punishment o f the heart
becomes prevalent and the suffering becomes more apparent, which is
actualized and known as the punishment o f the grave. So it is connected
to the life o f the grave just as the bodies are connected to this worldly
life.
The other type o f punishment on the body is also divided into two
categories. A type in the worldly life and a type in the Hereafter, and
their severity and continuity are in accordance with the ills that occurred
from the sin. All root evil in this life and the next is from sin and their
punishments, evil ‘shar’ is a generic term for all o f it. It roots from the
evil o f a soul and bad actions, and they are the two things that the
Prophet would seek refuge from in the introduction o f any address he
would make: “W e seek refuge in Allah from the evil o f our souls and
249

The Disease A nd The Cure

our bad actions.” Bad actions emanate from the evil nature o f a soul;
thus, the root cause o f evil is from the evil o f the soul, whilst the actions
are the branches and the results.
There are varying opinions regarding the statement o f the Prophet:
“From the evil o f our own deeds.” Does it mean the evil actions
themselves, in which case would be considered as attributing a type o f
action to its generic form? O r is it as others have said that the refuge is
sought from the evil consequences; in other words, the punishments of
our actions that will harm us.
This statement is validated because the refuge being sought includes
every form o f evil, as the evil o f the souls necessitate the practice o f bad
actions, and the bad actions are a cause for punishment. Therefore, he
mentioned the evil o f the souls due to what this consists o f from
despicable actions and suffices with that as it is the root cause. Then he
mentioned the end result o f this evil, which are the bad actions that carry
the negative outcome o f punishment and pain. Thus, this supplication
in seeking refuge includes refuge being sought from the root o f the evil,
its branches, its end result and whatever it necessitates.
Among the supplications o f the Angels for the believers is:
(^)

_Li9

o l - O l C J i

“And protect them from the evil consequences o f their deeds, and
w hoever You protect from evil consequences that day - You w ill
have given him m ercy.” [Ghafir:9]
This invocation necessitates a request that they are protected from the
evil actions and their consequences that are a harm to the individual,
since the person is protected from the evil consequences ifhe is protected
from the evil actions:

250

The Disease A n d The Cure

“And protect them from evil consequences that day - You will
have given him m ercy,” is in reference to the punishments from those
actions on that day.
If it is said: They asked Allah that the believers be protected from the
punishment o f the Hellfire, so it has been implied that the evil that is in
question here is the evil actions themselves, and the request o f the Angels
is equivalent to the request for refuge made by the Prophet. So the
statement o f “that day” does not rebuke this understanding because the
objective is to prevent the evil consequences o f the actions from taking
place on that day.
In addition, the protection from the consequence o f sins is o f two types.
Firstly: A prevention that occurred by the sole guidance and success
granted by Allah without being initiated by the individual. Secondly: A
prevention in the form o f forgiveness, and so the perpetrator is not
punished for it. Thus, this verse consists o f a request for two affairs whilst
it is conditional from a linguistic perspective.
Reflect on this realty o f the Angels in their praise for being o f the
believing creatures, performing righteous deeds, and being benevolent
to the believers by seeking forgiveness for them. They preceded their
request for forgiveness by an intercession to Allah through m entioning
His Perfect Knowledge and Mercy.
His Perfect Knowledge holds the knowledge o f their sins and their
causes, their lack o f infallibility, the overwhelming authority o f their
enemies and their souls and their whims and innate nature, the things
that have been beautified for them in this worldly life and its pleasures.
His Knowledge also consists o f their makeup being from the earth and
their condition within their m other’s wombs. He knows by His Infinite
Knowledge that they will inevitably disobey Him, and that He loves to
pardon and forgive and other than that from His Perfect Knowledge
that none other than Him can ever comprehend.
251

The Disease A nd The Cure

His Perfect Mercy necessitates that He shall never destroy anyone o f the
believers in Him from the people o f monotheistic belief and those who
truly love Him. Indeed, His Mercy is infinite, none are excluded from
His Mercy apart from the wretched, and there is none more wretched
than those who have not been included in His Mercy that has
encompassed everything.
Thereafter, the Angels asked the Lord to forgive the repentant ones who
adhered to His straight path - it is the path that leads to Him that is
knowing, loving and obeying Him. They repented from whatever He
dislikes and followed the path He loves.
After that they asked Him to protect them from the torm ent o f the
Hellfire and to admit them alongside the believers and their near
relatives and spouses into eternal Paradise that He promised them. Even
though Allah never fails to deliver His promise, He promised them this
Paradise after the fulfillment o f various causes. From them: The
supplication o f the Angels to admit them into Paradise by His mercy, so
He entered them into it by His mercy which includes His granting o f
success to them to fulfill the necessary good actions to enter, and He
made the Angels supplicate for their admittance.
Then, Allah mentioned that the Angels concluded this invocation by
saying “Indeed, You are a l - A z i z a l - H a k i m i.e., the source, the
reason and the perfection o f all o f the above originates from His Perfect
Ability and Knowledge. Iza (the attribute from the Name al-AzTz)
indicates His Perfect Ability, and H ikm ah (the attribute from the Name
al-Hakim) indicates His Perfect Knowledge. By these two attributes,
Allah decrees whatever He wills, commands and prohibits and rewards
and punishes and the creation, and His commands all come from the
two attributes.
The intent here is that the punishments for sins vary between
punishments in this life and those in the next. Both punishments are

The Disease A n d The Cure

either inflicted on the heart or the body or both, and there are
punishments in the grave after death and punishments on the Day o f
Resurrection.
Therefore, sin is never devoid o f a punishment, but due to the ignorance
of an individual, he may not notice the punishment he is experiencing
because he is like the drunk one and the drugged or the sleeping one
who does not feel pain. However, when he awakes or regains
consciousness, he will feel the pains. The relationship ot punishments to
sins is like that o f combustion to fire, a fracture to demolition, drow ning
to water, the damage the body receives from poison and illnesses to their
causes.
Furthermore, this harm could happen as an immediate consequence to
the sin, or it could be delayed slightly or for a longer period o f time, just
as an illness could show immediate consequences or could fail to appear
immediately after its causes have happened. This mistake happens
frequently in this scenario. Someone may perform a sin and not see its
effects immediately but remains unaware that it is affecting him
gradually, just as poisons and harmful substances affect the body. Either
the individual attains the necessary medicines, has an output for the
illness and a system to curb it, or he is on route to destruction. This is in
the case o f one sin that the individual has failed to conquer by
eradicating it and its effects, so what about sin after sin being perpetrated
daily and in every hour? Allah’s aid is sought.

253

The Disease A n d The Cure

Recollect the Punishments T hat Allah Has Set
for Sins
One must recall the punishments that have been set by Allah as a
punishment for perpetrating sins. Consider some o f them touching you
and make this a motive for the soul to abandon all sin. Here I shall list a
few that should suffice the intellectual and truthful one.
From it: A seal placed on the heart and the hearing, a veil over the sight,
a lock on the heart and a shield over it, a covering and a seal over the
heart, turning away the hearts and the eyes, an intervention between the
individual and his heart, heedlessness from remembering Allah,
forgetting oneself, forsaking the need for Allah to purify your heart, the
chest feeling constricted as if it is rising into the sky, diverting the hearts
from the truth, increasing to its illness, falling back into error. As alImam Ahmad mentioned on the authority o f Hudhayfah bin al-Yaman
-Allah be pleased with him - who said: “The hearts are four: A heart that
is pure with a lantern that radiates, that is the heart o f the believer. A
heart that is sealed, that is the heart o f the disbeliever. A heart that is
inverted, that is the heart o f the hypocrite and a heart that is fueled by
two components - the com ponent o f faith and the com ponent o f
hypocrisy, and the heart resembles whichever com ponent overrides the
other.”
Also, from the punishments is the discouraging nature and idleness
towards the obedience o f Allah.
From the punishments is the heart becoming deaf, unable to hear the
truth. Dumb, unable to speak the truth and blind, unable to see. Thus,
the relationship between his heart and the truth that is o f no benefit to
255

The Disease A n d The Cure

him is like the relationship between the deaf ear and sounds, or a blind
eye and colors or a tongue that cannot pronounce and speech. Through
this, it is known that this deafness, dumbness and blindness is attributed
to the heart itself in its essence, whereas the limbs follow accordingly.
Allah says:

“For indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded, but blinded are the
hearts that are w ithin the breasts.” [al-Hajj:46]
The meaning behind this is not the blindness o f the eyesight, how could
that ever be the case when Allah has said:

“There isn’t constraint on the blind o n e,” [al-N ur:6l] and He said:
0 ^ 1 iili jt 0 f e

“The Prophet frowned and turned away. W h en there came to him
the blind m an.” [Abasa:l-2]
However, the meaning is that true and complete blindness is the
blindness o f the heart, to the extent that the blindness o f the eyes may
be disregarded in comparison to it or to the point that it may be
completely ignored due to the strength o f the heart, as the Prophet
highlights in other examples that the reality o f an affair may not be as
many people deem: “The strong man is not one who is good at
wrestling, but the strong man is the one who controls himself in a fit o f
rage .”1 And his statement: “The poor man is not the one who goes round

1 C ollected by al-BukharT in the B ook o f M anners, C hapter: Beware o f B eing A ngry
25 6

The Disease A n d The Cure

to the people and is dismissed with one or two morsels, and one or two
dates. The poor one is he who does not ask the people and is not noticed
for charity to be given to him .”' There are many similar pieces o f text.
The intended meaning o f all this is that from the punishment o f a sin is
the heart becoming blind, deaf and dumb.
From them is the sinking o f the heart, just as a particular location can
sink along with everything on it, dropping it to the deepest depths
whilst the person may be unaware. The sign o f this is that the individual
remains wandering in close proximity o f things that are debased, filthy
and low, just as the heart that Allah has raised and drawn close to Him
on the other hand continues to wander around righteousness, goodness
and dignified actions, statements and manners.
Some o f the Pious Predecessors would say: “These hearts wander, some
o f them wander around the mighty Throne and others wander around
the bushes.”
Also, from the punishments is the disfigurement o f the heart, just as the
image can be disfigured making the heart resemble the heart o f the beast
that he has resembled in his manners, actions and innate nature. Some
hearts become disfigured to resemble the manners o f a pig due to the
intense resemblance o f the individual to it. Some o f them resemble the
mannerisms o f a dog or a donkey or a snake or a scorpion or other than
that.
In fact, this is the explanation o f Sufyan bin Uyaynah to the statement
of Allah:

[6114]. Also c o llected by M uslim [2609].

“There is not a creature on the earth nor a bird that flies w ith its
w ings except that they are com m unities like y o u .” [al-An am:38]
He said: “Some resemble a predator, some carry the traits o f dogs or pigs
or donkeys. Others flaunt themselves in their garments as the peacock
flaunts itself in its feathers, others are unintellectual like the donkey and
some overestimate themselves like the rooster, others are as friendly as
the pigeon and easy to get along with whilst others hold grudges like
the camel, some are all good like the goat, some resemble wolves and
some are as deceptive as the fox’.
Allah has resembled the ignorant and deviant ones with the donkeys at
times, with dogs at times and with livestock at other times. This
resemblance develops itself in the inner-self until it appears faintly in the
open by those who scrutinize their state, and it continues to appear in
the actions o f an individual until it is seen by all. The resemblance
continues to strengthen until it matches the image until it becomes
blatantly clear by the permission o f Allah. It is the complete
disfigurement whereby Allah transforms the outer appearance to
resemble the animal itself, as he did with the Jews and their likes and as
He will do with a group from this nation into apes and pigs. Subhan
A llah! How many hearts have been turned away whilst the individual
has not realized! How many hearts have been disfigured or sunk to a
deep depth, yet the individual is unaware! And how many have been
trialed by the praise o f the people for them, deluded by the concealment
o f Allah o f their sins and allured by the blessings o f Allah on them! All
o f which are forms o f punishments and belittlement whilst the ignorant
one deems them to be honor.

258

The Disease A n d The Cure

Also, from the punishments is the plan o f Allah against the evil plotter,
and the misleading o f the deceptive one, the mockery o f the one who
mocks and the misguidance o f the one who digresses from the truth.
From them also is the misguidance o f the heart until it begins to see the
falsehood as truth and the truth as falsehood, the good as evil and the evil
as good, he corrupts but he thinks he is rectifying, obstructing the path
to Allah whilst thinking he is calling to it, exchanging guidance for
falsehood whilst thinking he is upon guidance and following his own
desires yet claiming to be obedience to his Master (Allah). All o f the
above are punishments afflicted on the heart.
Among them also is the veil over the heart from the Lord in this life and
the greatest veil on the Day o f Resurrection, as Allah said:

“No! Rather the veil has covered their hearts o f that w hich they
were earning. No! Indeed, from their Lord on that day they shall
be partitioned.” [al-Mutafifin:14,15]
Sins prevented them from crossing the passage over to their hearts so
that they can know what will be o f benefit to them and what will purify
them, what will corrupt them and what will make them wretched. They
were prevented from crossing the distance between their hearts and their
Lord so that the hearts can reach Him, triumph in victory and receive
His honor, receiving the eyes delight and the pleasure o f the soul.
Moreover, their sins were a veil between them and their ow n hearts and
a veil between them and their Creator.
Also: A miserable life in this life and in the grave and in the Hereafter,
he will be subject to the torment. Allah said:

259

The Disease A n d The Cure

“And w hoever turns away from My remembrance shall have a
miserable life, and W e w ill gather him on the day o f resurrection
blind.” [Ta Ha: 124]
This miserable life has been explained as the punishment o f the grave,
there is no doubt that it is from it and the verse entails what is even more
general. The context o f the verse affirms something that is unspecified,
as Allah has decreed that a miserable life comes as a consequence to
diverting from His remembrance. The one who diverts from His
remembrance shall experience a miserable life proportionate to their
digression, even if they experience abundant blessing o f the worldly life,
in his heart will remain a feeling o f desolation, humiliation and sorrow
that breaks the heart and crushes the false hopes and torments under the
guise o f the intoxication o f desires, lusts and an infatuation with the
worldly life and leadership, if not coupled with the intoxication of
alcohol! The intoxication o f these affairs is more severe than the
intoxication o f alcohol because one can wake up and come to their
senses with alcohol, but the intoxication o f desires and an infatuation for
the worldly life are seldom woken from until the person dies. Living
through a miserable life is something inevitable in this life, the grave and
the Hereafter for the one who digresses from the remembrance o f Allah.
The eye will not find its delight, the heart will not find peace and the
soul will not be reassured except by way o f its Lord W ho is the Only
O ne worshipped in truth and every other deity worshipped besides Him
is false. W hoever is delighted with Allah shall be a source o f joy for
others, but whoever is not in this state o f delight will find their heart
torn apart in regret. Allah has declared that the pleasant life will be given
to those who believe in Him and do righteous deeds, as Allah said:

good o f this worldly life and the Hereafter, they attained a pleasant life
in both abodes as the pleasure o f the soul, its joy, bliss, delight,

261

The Disease A n d The Cure

reassurance, comfort, light, and wellbeing compared to the unlawful
desires and deceitful doubts is the true happiness and the pleasure
restricted to the body is incomparable to it. Some o f those who felt this
pleasure would say: “If the kings and the offspring o f the kings knew the
feelings we experience, they would have fought us for it with their
swords.”
Others would say: “Indeed, the heart experiences moments wherein I
say: ‘If the people o f Paradise feel this way, they are surely experiencing
a pleasant life.’”
Others would say: “In this life there is a paradise. It is like a paradise in
the worldly life, and whoever enters it here enters the Paradise in the
Hereafter, and whoever does not enter it here, will not enter the Paradise
o f the Hereafter.”
Furthermore, the Prophet made an indication to this paradise in his
statement: “If you pass by the gardens o f Paradise, sit in them .” The
Companions asked: “W hat are the gardens o f Paradise?” He replied:
“The gatherings o f knowledge [remembrance].” 1 He also said:
“Between my home and pulpit is a garden from the gardens o f
Paradise.”2

“Indeed, the righteous w ill be in pleasure. And indeed, the w icked
w ill be in the H ellfire.” [al-Infitar:13,14] is solely in reference to the
Day o f Judgm ent, rather it refers to all three abodes. W hich pleasantry
is better than the righteousness and comfort o f the heart? The
knowledge o f the Lord, loving Him and complying with His
commands? And is there any other life in reality w orth living other than
the one with a sound heart?
Allah commended His dear ally for having a sound heart by saying:

“And indeed am ong his kind was Ibrahim [Abraham]. W h en he
came to His Lord w ith a sound heart.” [As-Saffat:83-84]
And Allah also mentioned that he said:

“The day w hen there w ill be no benefit from w ealth or children.
But only one w ho com es to Allah w ith a sound heart.” [AshShu’raa:88,89]
The sound heart is the one that is free o f polytheism, malice, spite, envy,
greed, arrogance and an infatuation for the worldly life and leadership
in it. Safe from any illness that distances him from Allah, any doubt that
conflicts with the revelation, any desire that conflicts with His
command, any intent that conflicts with the Lord’s orders and anything
else that severs the ties between him and his Lord. This is the sound heart
that lives in a current paradise and it will live through a paradise in the
grave and in the paradise on the final day.

263

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Soundness o f the H eart Is N ot Complete
Unless It Is Safe from Five Things
The soundness o f the heart is by no means attained until it is safe from
five things: polytheism that conflicts with monotheism, innovation that
opposes Sutmah, whims that conflict with the commands, heedlessness
that conflicts with remembrance and desires that contradict sincerity.
These five are a veil between them and Allah, and each one represents a
multitude o f its kind.
Therefore, the need or rather the necessity for the servant to ask Allah
to guide him to the straight path is extreme. The servant is not in need
o f anything more than a response to this request and there is nothing
more beneficial to him than it. The straight path entails knowledge and
constantly implementing or relinquishing apparent or inner actions. An
individual may know the details o f this straight path or may not or
whatever is unknow n could outweigh what is known. Also, he may be
able to implement what he knows or possibly not, yet it is from the
straight path even if he is incapable o f doing it. He may want the actions
he is able to implement, or he may not w ant it out o f laziness,
carelessness or another preventative reason. You may implement the
thing you want, or you may not. You may include the conditions o f
sincerity in the things you implement, or you may not. From the things
that you implement with sincerity, you may achieve the adherence to
the Sitnnah, or you may not. You may remain firm upon whatever you
implement with this adherence or you may deviate from it.
All o f this transpires and is reality amongst the creatures whether in
excess or scarcity.

This is not something that people will incline to if left to their own
devices; rather, whenever someone is left to solely depend on
themselves, there will be an obstacle between the above and himself.
This is the rejection that the hypocrites fell into due to their sins, Allah
left them to themselves and their original state o f oppression and
ignorance.

266

The Disease A n d The Cure

The M eaning o f ‘The Lord Is on the Straight
Path’
The Lord Most High is on the straight path in His commands and
decree, prohibitions and orders and guides whoever He wills to His
straight path from His virtue, mercy and blesses a person with guidance
so that he may be righteous, and diverts whoever He wills from His
straight path from His justice and wisdom due to the lack o f suitability
o f the individual, which is a required factor in being upon the straight
path. So He is on the straight path and has set a straight path for His
servants to adhere to and invited them to it as a proof and just measure,
then He guided whomever He wills to adhere to it as a favor and virtue
from Him w ithout exiting from it due to His justice and virtue. O n the
Day ofjudgm ent, He will set a straight and narrow path that takes them
to His paradise, but He will divert those whom he diverted in the
worldly life from it and allow those w ho were on the straight path in
the worldly life to remain firm on it. He will make the light o f belief
that His servants had in Him, His Messenger and His revelation into a
tangible light that will appear before them, one that they will be guided
w ith through the darkness o f that path on the Day o f Judgment.
However, He will maintain their light for them until they cross it, just
as He maintained their faith until they met Him. He will extinguish the
light o f the hypocrites at a time they will need it most, just as He
extinguished it for them in the worldly life. The actions o f the sinners
will become prevalent through the hooks on the sides o f this path that
will snatch them, just as they were snatched from the path o f
steadfastness in the worldly life and made the speed by which they
traverse this path proportionate to their actions in the worldly life. He
267

The Disease A n d The Cure

further set a lake for the believers which they shall drink from,
proportionate to the portion from His legislation they adhered to. O n
the other hand, He denied a drink to anyone who failed to drink from
His legislation and religion in the worldly life.
Look at the Hereafter as if you see it with your ow n two eyes and ponder
over the perfect W isdom o f Allah in both abodes, and you will surely
come to know w ithout doubt that the worldly life is a plantation for the
Hereafter and it is an introduction and an example, and that the levels o f
the people in the Hereafter with regards to the jo y or torm ent they will
receive are determined through their levels in this worldly life as it relates
to their faith, righteous actions or the opposite. Allah grants success.
From the most severe punishments for a sin is exiting this straight path
in this life and the Hereafter.

268

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Contrast in Punishments Depends on the
Contrast Between the Sins
Since the sins vary in severity and detriment, it is also the case that the
punishments in this life and the Hereafter vary accordingly. By
assistance from Allah, we shall proceed in m entioning here a concise
segment in this regard.
1 say: These punishments originate from two things: abandoning a
command or partaking in a prohibition; hence, that are the two sins that
Allah trialed the mother and father o f all mankind and jinn-kind. Both
are divided in consideration o f their place, w hether it is apparent on the
limbs or inward upon the heart. They are further divided depending on
their connection with the right that must be delivered to Allah or the
rights o f the creatures, even though every right o f the creatures includes
a right to the Creator but was simply referred to as the right o f the
creation because it must be afforded upon their request and is waived off
if they request as much.

269

The Disease A n d The Cure

Sins Fall into Four Categories
Thereafter, sins are divided into four categories: authoritarian, devilish,
predatory and animalistic, and they do not escape from being any o f
these four.
The authoritarian sins: T o undertake some o f the attributes that do not
suit him from the attributes o f Lordship such as grandeur, self-glory,
supremacy, invincibility, sublimity, enslavement o f the creation and the
likes. Polytheism is also included in this category and is o f two types:
polytheism in the Names and Attributes o f Allah and worship o f another
deity besides Allah. The second type is a lesser polytheism in the actions
that may not warrant an eternal existence in the Hellfire but will cause
the action it appears in to be null and void, and this category o f sin is the
most perilous. It also includes speaking about Allah w ithout correct
knowledge about His creation and His Words. Thus, whoever is a
perpetrator o f these kinds o f sins is challenging Allah in His Lordship
and Sovereignty and has set a false partner alongside Him. This is the
gravest sin with Allah that no action can avail alongside it.
As for the devilish type o f sin, it is to undertake a resemblance to the
devil in envy, transgression, deceit, harboring grudges, betrayal,
conniving, ordering and beautifying disobedience to Allah, forbidding
obedience to Him and m erging the two whilst innovating into the
religion and inviting to innovation and misguidance. This kind tails the
first kind in its detriment even though this one is o f a lesser degree.
As for the predatory kind, they are the sins o f transgression, anger,
spilling o f blood, taking advantage o f the weak and the incapable. This

271

The Disease A n d The Cure

type o f sin gives birth to various forms o f inhumane harms and the
audacity to commit oppression and offence.
As for the animalistic kind: They are like greed and an eager
determination and diligence to fulfill the desire o f the stomach and the
sexual organs. From which fornication arises, theft, unlawful
consumption o f orphan’s wealth, miserliness, gluttony, cowardice,
unrest, and impatience and other than that. This segment portrays the
majority o f the sins amongst the creation due to their inability to fulfill
the predatory and authoritarian sins through which they find an
opening into the rest o f the categories. Thus, it reins them in and they
enter the predatory sins followed by the devilish ones, then onto
challenging for Lordship and polytheism. So whoever contemplates on
this adequately will realize that sins are a gateway to polytheism, unbelief
and challenging Allah in His Lordship.

272

The Disease A n d The Cure

Sins are M ajor and Lesser T han the Major
The Q ur’an and the Sutmah and the consensus o f the Companions o f the
Prophet and their pious successors and the leading scholars o f Islam have
all evidently shown that sins are divided into major and those lesser that
that. Allah said:

“And if you avoid the major sins w hich you are forbidden, W e will
remove from you your lesser sins.” [A n-N isa:3l]
p ill

pi^i ' J $ 5

^J\

Allah also said: “Those w ho avoid the major sins and immoralities,
only com m itted lesser on es.” [An-Najm:32]
Also in the Saliih o f al-BukharT, he reported that the Prophet said: “The
five daily prayers, Friday prayer to Friday prayer, and Ramadan to
Ramadan are expiations to what occurred between them if the major
sins have been avoided.”1
These actions o f expiation are spread across three levels:
One: A type that fall short in expiating the lesser sins due to their
inadequacy, lack o f sincerity and fulfillment o f the necessary tenants in

the action in the same fashion that the weak medicine falls short in
dosage and method o f administration in remedying the illness.
Two: They battle against the lesser sins but do not become strong
enough to expiate the major sins.
Three: They are strong enough to expiate the lesser sins but have an
extra strength used to expiate some o f the major sins.
Reflect over this, because it will eradicate many problems you may have.
It has been recorded in the two Sahihs o f al-Bukhari and M uslim1 that
the Prophet said: “Should I not inform you o f the largest major sin?” W e
said: “Inform us, Messenger o f Allah
He said: “Associating partners
alongside Allah, disobedience towards one’s ow n parents, and false
testimony.”
It has also been recorded in the two Sahihs o f al-Bukhari and Muslim2
that the Prophet said: “Avoid the seven destructive sins.” It was asked:
“W hat are they, Messenger o f Allah $S?” He replied: “Polytheism,
sorcery, killing any soul unlawfully, unlawfully consuming the wealth
o f the orphans, consuming usury, fleeing in combat and falsely accusing
the chaste, unaware and believing women o f unlawful sexual
intercourse.”
It has also been recorded in the two Sahihs o f al-Bukhari and Muslim
that the Prophet was asked: ‘W hat is the gravest sin?’ He replied: “To set
a partner alongside Allah, when it is He W ho created you.” It was further
asked: “Then what?” He replied: “To murder your child in fear that he
or she will eat with you [fear o f poverty].” It was again asked: “Then

what?” He said: “To commit sexual intercourse with you neighbor’s
spouse.” Then Allah revealed the following verse to testify for this:

jJ ij

“And those w ho do not invoke w ith Allah another deity or kill the
soul w hich Allah has forbidden except by right and do not com m it
unlawful sexual intercourse.” [al-Furqan:68]
Scholars though have differed into tw o different opinions with regards
to the major sins as far as their numbers and whether they are confined
to a particular number. Furthermore, those who have confined the
number are also divided as far as how many there are exactly:
Abdullah bin Mas'ud said: “They are four.”
Abdullah bin Umar said: “They are seven.”
Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin al-‘Aas said: “They are nine.”
Others have said: “They are eleven.”
Others have said: “They are seventy.”
Abu Talib al-Maki said: “I enumerated them from the statements o f the
Companions and found that they are four in the heart, they are
polytheism, persistence upon a sin, despair from the mercy o f Allah, and
a false sense o f reassurance from the torm ent o f Allah. Four on the
tongue, they are false testimony, falsely accusing the chaste ones o f
illegal sexual intercourse, lying under oath to obtain a right that is not
your own, and sorcery. Three in the stomach, they are consumption o f
alcohol, unlawfully consuming the wealth o f orphans and consuming
usury. Tw o from the private parts, they are fornication and sodomy.
Tw o on the hands, they are m urder and theft. O ne from the feet, and it

275

The Disease A n d The Cure

is fleeing during combat and one that is connected to the entire body,
which is unruliness to parents.”
However, those who have not restricted it to a particular figure also have
variations in their statements. Some say anything that has been
prohibited in the Q u r’an is a major sin and anything that has been
prohibited by the Messenger is lesser than that. Another group have
stated: “W hatever carries the threat o f a punishment such as a curse,
wrath or specific punishment is a major sin and whatever is not coupled
with such a threat is a lesser sin.”
It has also been said: Anything that carries an Islamic reprimand in this
life or a threat in the Hereafter is a major sin and whatever does not carry
either o f the two is a lesser sin.
It has also been said: Anything that has been agreed upon as unlawful
from the various scriptures and legislations is from the major sins whilst
anything that has been prohibited in some legislation aside from others
is a lesser sin.
It has also been said: Any action wherein Allah has cursed the perpetrator
and His Messenger is a major sin.
It has also been said that it is all o f what has been mentioned from the
beginning o f the chapter o f A n -N is d until the verse:

“If you avoid the major sins w hich you are forbidden, W e will
remove from you your lesser sins.” [A n-N isa:3l]
As for those who did not even divide sins into major and lesser, they
justify this by saying that all sins are o f a major type from the perspective
that the defiance to Allah and disobedience and opposition to the
command o f Allah is a major sin. Thus, considering whose command

276

The Disease A n d The Cure

has been opposed and whose laws have been violated warrants all sins to
be major, and they are all equal in this regard. They also say: This
perspective is made more evident as Allah is not harmed by the sins of
the creation nor do they have any effect on Him, thus none can be
greater than the other, and this only leaves us to consider the sin itself
and the violation and there is no difference in this regard between one
sin to another.
They continue: It is further proved by the detriment o f the sin being
tied in with the level o f defiance and violation o f the rights o f Allah. For
example, if an individual consumes alcohol or commits unlawful sexual
intercourse whilst they believe it to be permissible, this person has
combined between ignorance and the evil o f partaking in sin. O n the
other hand, if someone who believes it is impermissible to do so, yet
carries out this action, he would have fallen into one o f the tw o evils and
his punishment will be lesser than the first person’s. Therefore, this
indicates that the evil o f a sin depends on the level o f defiance and
violation.
They go on to say: Another aspect that reinforces this argument is that
any sin necessitates the belittlement o f the command and prohibition of
the one obeyed along with violating the sanctity whilst there is no
difference in this from sin to sin.
They continue: O ne should not look to the magnitude o f the sin in their
own view, but instead consider the stature and m ight o f the O ne who is
disobeyed, and the violation caused o f His sacred laws. Once again, this
does not differ from sin to sin. If a mighty king were to order two o f his
subjects to deliver something to a distant land and the other to carry
something out besides the dwelling and both o f them disobey him, they
would both be equal in receiving the king’s wrath and devaluation.
They also said: Based on all this, we can see that the one who fails to
perform the Hajj pilgrimage or the Friday prayer whilst able and
277

The Disease A n d The Cure

residing in Mecca is worse than the one who fails to perform it from a
distant land. The obligation on one is more than the other. Additionally,
if someone possessed two hundred dirham but failed to pay Z a ka t whilst
the other person had two hundred thousand yet failed to pay Zakat, they
would both be the same in the w rong o f rejecting to perform what is
obligatory upon them and their positions in receiving a punishment as
long as both o f them persist in not offering the Z a ka t whether it is in a
small amount o f wealth or large.

Clarifying This Discussion
Allah sent His Messengers, revealed His Books and created the heavens
and the earth so the creation may come to know Him, worship Him
alone and for the religion, obedience and supplication be delivered
sincerely to Him. As Allah said:
e L iii Uj
“I have not created the jin n and m ankind except to worship M e.”
[Ad-thariyat:56]
He also said:

“W e have not created the heavens and the earth and all that is
betw een them except in truth.” [al-Hijr:85]
Allah also said:

And Allah said: “Allah has made the Ka’bah, the sacred house

animals and the garlands. That is so you k n ow that Allah knows
w hat is in the heavens and the earth and that Allah is k n o w in g o f
all things.” [al-M a’idah:97]
So Allah has informed that the purpose o f creation and His W ords is so
that He may be known through His Perfect Names and Attributes and
so He may be worshipped w ithout any partners and so the people may
maintain their affairs injustice and that it is the justice that the heavens
and the earth have been established on the basis o f as Allah said:

“W e have already sent Our Messengers w ith clear evidences and
sent w ith them the Scripture and balance that people may
m aintain their affairs in ju stice.” [al-Hadid:25]
The greatest justice is to worship Allah alone, in fact it is the pinnacle of
all that is right and the root on which it stems from and polytheism is
the greatest wrong. Polytheism is the highest form o f wrong, whereas
monotheism is the most upright form o f justice, and whatever carries
the greatest opposition to this aim o f monotheism is considered the
gravest major sin and its level varies accordingly, and whatever agrees
most to this objective becomes the greatest obligation and act of
obedience.
Contemplate on this principle and carefully consider its details in order
to know the perfect W isdom o f the Most-Wise, and the Most

2H0

The Disease A n d The Cure

Knowledgeable in whatever He has ordered or prohibited His subjects
with and the varying levels o f acts o f obedience and acts o f disobedience.
Since polytheism negates this objective in its essence, consequently it is
the largest major sin without exception. Allah has made Paradise out o f
reach for every polytheist. Allah has refused to ever accept an action
from a polytheist or accept an intercession on his behalf, or accept a
supplication from him in the Hereafter or pardon him o f a mistake as
the polytheist is the most ignorant one o f his Lord, because he has set a
partner and equal alongside the one who created him, which is the
pinnacle o f ignorance just as it is the greatest injustice. The polytheist
has not oppressed his Lord but has only oppressed himself.
Here, an issue o f discussion arises. It is that the polytheist’s intent is to
glorify the Lord and due to the Lord’s noble stature, it would not be
befitting to address Him unless there are intermediaries and intercessors
just as is the case with the kings in this life. Thus, the polytheist did not
intend to degrade the Lord, instead, he intended to glorify Him. He says:
I worship these intermediaries so that they draw me closer to Him and
allow me to address Him. This is the sole intent and these are means in
intercessions. So why do these efforts warrant His wrath and anger and
an eternal existence in the Hellfire?
Additionally, a further question follows on from this one and poses itself.
It is: Is it viable that Allah legislates that the method o f gaining closeness
to Him happens through intercessors and intermediaries - meaning, that
this impermissibility stems from the legislation - or is it something
rejected by the innate nature and intellect o f mankind making it
impossible for any legislation to bring, and that the legislations came to
approve what is in the innate nature and the intellects from its
heinousness? And what is the secret behind polytheism never being
subject to forgiveness amongst all other sins? As Allah said:

281

The Disease A n d The Cure

“Indeed, Allah does not forgive that partners are associated w ith
H im , and forgives all else lesser than that to w hoever He w ills.”
[An-Nisa:48].
Reflect deeply over this question and consciously intend a presence o f
heart and mind for the answer, and do not marginalize it because it is
the difference between the people o f monotheistic Islamic belief and
polytheists, and it is the difference between those who have knowledge
of Allah and those who do not, and the people o f Paradise and the people
o f the Hellfire. Thus, I begin by saying - and success and assistance is
granted by Allah and from Him comes all the aid and accuracy,
whomsoever He guides, none can then misguide and whomsoever He
misguides, none can then guide, and there is none who can resist what
He gives, and none can give what He resists:
Polytheism (shirk) is two types:
•
•

A polytheism that is associated with the Essence and the Names and
Attributes o f Allah.
A polytheism that is associated with worship and actions devoted
and directed to Him that can occur even if the one performing it
believes that there is no equal or partner to Him in His Essence or
His Attributes or Actions.

The first type o f polytheism is also two types:
One: The polytheism o f rejection ( Ta'tll ). It is the most abhorrent form
just like the polytheism o f the Pharaoh who said: “W hat is the Lord of
creation?” And he further addressed his ally Haman by saying: “Build
me some steps so I may see the Lord o f Musa (Moses), indeed I deem
that he is from the liars.” This form o f rejection and polytheism is one
and the same, as every rejectionist is a polytheist and every polytheist is

28 2

The Disease A n d The Cure

a rejectionist. However, polytheism is not restricted to rejection, because
a polytheist could hold the belief that there exists a Creator who possesses
attributes, but this person may deny the fulfillment o f worshipping Him
alone.
Therefore, the origin o f all polytheism and the base principle that it
refers to is rejection (T a ’tll), and it is three types:
•
•
•

Rejecting the creation belonging to a Creator
Rejecting the Creator from possessing perfection by rejecting His
Names, Attributes and Actions
Rejecting the obligations o f monotheism (Tawhid) that are
incumbent upon a servant

From this arises the polytheism o f the believers in wahdatul wujood
(pantheism) who declare there is not more than one entity or being.
Rather, the Lord is in essence one with the creation.
Also, the polytheism o f the atheists who declare that the universe has no
beginning and is eternal in the future and that it never ceased to exist at
any point and is continuous and permanent. They also say that any
occurrence in the universe originates in their view from means and
intermediaries that are the only method by which something is created
(denying the Creator) and they call this ‘uqool’ and ‘nufus’.
Likewise, this type o f polytheism also gives rise to a polytheism that
entails the rejection o f the Names, Attributes and Actions o f Allah. This
occurs from the extreme Jahtnites and the Qaramite sects. They refuse to
affirm a Name o f an Attribute to Allah and instead have professed that
the creatures are more complete, because the perfection in essence is
through the Names and Attributes.
The second type o f polytheism is the type wherein an individual sets a
partner to Allah that they devote their worship to w ithout negating His
Names and Attributes and Lordship. Such as the polytheism o f the
28 3

The Disease A nd The Cure

Christians who say Allah is the third from three after believing Jesus and
his mother to be deities.
This also resembles the polytheism o f the pagan idolaters who say that
all good originates from light, and evil is from darkness. From this comes
the polytheism o f the QadarJyah sect who say that the creature creates
their own actions and that such actions occur without the Free Will and
Power o f Allah. Thus, it is through this they resemble the pagan idolater.
Also, from this form o f polytheism is the type that the one who argued
with Ibrahim (Abraham) committed:

“W h en Ibrahim [Abraham] said: ‘My Lord is the O ne W h o gives
life and causes death,’ he said: ‘I give life and cause death.’” [alBaqarah:258]
This argumentative person set himself as an equal to Allah, falsely
claiming that he gives life and causes death just as Allah gives life and
causes death. So Ibrahim [Abraham] imposed upon him that such an
assertion would mean that you are also able to make the sun rise from a
direction other than the direction Allah makes it rise from. This is not a
diversion from the initial claim o f the disputants, in fact, it obliges one
to present a proof for the claim.
Also, from this form o f polytheism is the kind whereby someone set the
planets and celestial bodies as equals to Allah, making them Lords and
controllers over the universe, as is the case with the polytheists o f the
Sabi’ah sect and others.

284

The Disease A n d The Cure

This form o f polytheism also gives rise to the polytheism o f sun and fire
worshippers and others alike. There are those who claim that their deity
is the one and true god, there are others who claim that their deity is the
greatest o f them all and there are others who claim that their deity is one
o f many and that if one were to devote themselves to this particular deity
it would in return look after them. There are also others who claim that
the lesser deity will draw them closer to the deity above, continuing in
this fashion until they provide them with a connection with Allah, so at
times the intermediaries are many, and at times they decrease in number.
As for the polytheism committed in worship, it is o f a lesser degree than
the polytheism mentioned above (without trivializing the severity o f
either). It emanates from the one who believes there is none worthy o f
worship except Allah, and that it is Allah alone W ho brings forth harm
and benefit, provides and denies and believes there is no other Lord
other than He. However, he may not devote some actions o f worship
with sincerity to Him but instead intend to satisfy his own ego, or a
pleasure in the worldly life or higher status and position amongst the
people. Nonetheless, a portion o f his actions and endeavors are devoted
to Allah along with a portion being devoted to his own soul, his desires,
to the devil and a portion to the creation. This is the state o f the majority
o f people. It is the polytheism that the Prophet said regarding:
“Polytheism in this nation is more obscure than the ants’ footsteps.” The
Companions asked: “How do we find salvation from that, Messenger o f
Allah S3?” He replied: “Say: Allah, I seek refuge in You from ever
knowingly associating partners with You, and I seek You forgiveness
for whatever I do not know .” So every aspect o f showing off (in
worship) is polytheism.

“Say: ‘Indeed, I am a man just like you but I receive revelation that
your Lord is O ne. So w hoever aspires for the m eeting w ith his
Lord - let him do righteous good deeds and not associate anyone
in the worship o f his Lord’” [al-Kahf:110]
Just as there is no other true deity other than Allah, it is only right to
devote all acts o f worship sincerely to Him and just as He has singled
Himself out as the only true deity, it is only correct to single Him out in
worship. Righteous actions are those that are clear o f any showing off
and restricted to the Prophetic Sunnah.
Among the supplications o f Umar bin al-Khattab -Allah be pleased with
him - is: “Allah, render all o f my actions pious, and for Your Face sincere
and do not render any portion o f it to anyone else.” ' This type o f
polytheism within an act o f worship nullifies the reward for that
particular action, and the individual who commits it may be punished
for it if the act was an obligation, because it would be as if it were not
performed, so it would equate to a punishment for an obligation that has
not been fulfilled. Allah said:

something not required o f him, so it is not correct and will not be
accepted from him.
Allah says in a Qudsi narration: “I am the O ne W ho is most free from
need o f partners. He who does a thing for the sake o f someone else
beside Me is left to the one he associated Me with, and I am free from
him.”'
This polytheism is divided into a type that is forgiven and a type that is
not, or major and a lesser form.
As for the first type o f polytheism m entioned previously, it is under the
major form, some being more severe than the other and none o f it is
forgiven (if someone dies in that condition w ithout repentance). From
which is the polytheism in love and glorification whereby one loves
someone or something from the creation as much as they love Allah, this
is from the polytheism that is not forgiven by Allah and it the polytheism
Allah mentioned in the following verse:

are gathered by the Hellfire:

“By Allah, we were indeed in manifest error, w hen we equated
you w ith the Lord o f creation.” [Ash-Shu’ara:97-98]
Although it is well known that they did not equate them with Him in
creating, providing sustenance, causing end to life, giving life,
sovereignty or ability but they equated them in love, devotion and
worship, submissiveness and servitude. This is the epitome o f injustice
and ignorance. How can dust ever be equated to the supreme Lord?
How can the slave equate to the Master o f all slaves? How can the
destitute or the weak or the incapable or the needy who was once non­
existent ever be equated to the O ne who is Self-Sufficient, principally
able to do all things and possesses perfect independence, absolute
sovereignty, perfect ability and benevolence, knowledge and mercy that
are all from His essence?
W hich injustice is greater than this? W hich judgm ent is more unfair
than this, as he has equated the O ne W ho has no equal with His
creation?
As Allah says:

“Absolute praise belongs to Allah W h o created the heavens and
the earth and created darkness and light, then those w ho
disbelieve in their Lord equate others w ith H im .” [al-An am :l]
So the polytheist has equated the One who created the heavens and the
earth and darkness and light with someone who does not even possess
an atoms weight o f the heavens and the earth for themselves or anyone

Polytheism in Action, Statement and Intent
The aforementioned form o f polytheism is also accompanied by the
polytheism in actions, statements and intentions.
Polytheism in actions could be such as prostrating to other than Allah,
circumambulating around something other than the Sacred House,
shaving the head in submissiveness to other than Allah, kissing stones
other than the black stone or kissing or greeting the graves or
prostrating before them.
The Prophet has cursed the one who takes the graves o f the pious and
the Prophets as places o f worship to Allah, so what would be considered
the case if the graves are taken as shrines that are worshipped besides
Allah!?
Al-BukharT and Muslim have both collected a narration on the authority
Aisha and Ibn Abbas w ho report that the Messenger said: “Allah has
cursed the Jews and the Christians, they took the graves o f the Prophets
as shrines o f worship.”'
The Prophet also said: “From the worst o f the people are those who are
alive during the advent o f the Hour, and those w ho take the graves as
shrines o f worship .”2

Al-Imam Ahmad has collected in the M usnad as well as Ibn Hibban in
his Sahih that the Prophet said: “Allah has cursed the women who visit
the graves, and those who take them as shrines for worship or hang
lanterns on them .”2
The Prophet also said: “Allah’s anger has intensified against a people w ho
take the graves o f their Prophet as shrines for worship.”
He also said: “Those who came before you, if any pious man dies
amongst them, they would build a place o f worship at his grave and
make these pictures on it. They are the worst creatures in the sight o f
Allah on the Day o f Resurrection .”3 This is the condition o f the one who
prays to Allah at a grave shrine, so what about the one who prays in that
same place to other than Allah! The Prophet said: “Allah, do not make
my grave a shrine that is worshipped .”4
The Prophet championed and defended the monotheistic Islamic belief
to the utmost level, even prohibiting voluntary prayers during sunrise
and sunset so that it does not become a means that leads to resembling

Polytheism in Speech
Amongst the forms o f polytheism committed besides Allah is the type
that occurs through speech, such as m aking an oath by other than Allah,
as has been reported in the M usnad o f al-Imam Ahmad and the Sunan o f
Abu Dawud wherein the Prophet said: “W hoever swears by other than
Allah has committed Shirk [polytheism ].”1 Al-Hakim and Ibn Hibban
have authenticated this narration as Sahih. Also, from this form o f
polytheism is the statement used w hen addressing someone by saying:
“W hat Allah wills and what you will.” It has been authentically reported
that a man said to the Prophet: “W hat Allah wills and what you will,” so
he replied, “Have you set me as a partner to Allah? Say: ‘W hatever Allah
alone wills.’”2
This is the case even though Allah has affirmed will power to a human,
as is evident in His statement:
Op-riP-"!!

(•^ -? iddS y d

“For w hoever o f you wills to be steadfast.” [At-Takwlr:28]
Therefore, consider the state o f someone who further states: “I am reliant

no one but Allah and you,” or “This is from Allah and you,” or “These
are from Allah’s blessings and yours,” or “Allah takes care o f me from the

such as: “By Allah and the life o f so and so,” or “I make a vow to Allah
and to so and so,” or “I hope in Allah and so and so,” or “I repent to Allah
and so and so,” and the likes.
Compare the above statements with the statement of: “W hat Allah wills
and what you will,” then find out which one o f the two is viler, and it
will be clear to you that the one who utters any o f them is deserving o f
receiving the response o f the Prophet, and if this individual were to set
him as a partner to Allah through such a statement, then the other has
made someone who does not equate to the stature o f the Messenger o f
Allahis as a partner with Allah in a particular matter. Rather, this person
w hom he has set as a partner to the Lord o f all creation may even be an
enemy to the Messenger o f Allah
So prostration, other acts o f worship, reliance, a frequent return to Allah,
piety, fear, sufficiency, repentance, vowing, oaths, Tasbih (Subhan
Allah), Takbir (Allah-u Akbar), Tahlil (La llaha Ilia Allah), Talm ud
(Alhamdullilah), seeking forgiveness, shaving or trim m ing the hair in
worship and submissiveness, circumambulating the K abah and
invocation is all an exclusive right that is directed to Allah, and it is not
correct or permissible to anyone else whether they be a close angel or a
sent Prophet. A narration has been recorded in the M usnad o f Al-Imam
A hm ad 1 that states that a man who had sinned was brought to the
Prophet, w hen he came before him, he said: “Allah I repent to you, not
to M uham m ad^.” So the Prophet said: “He has recognized each one’s
due rights.”

Polytheism in O n e’s Aspirations and Intentions
Polytheism that dwells w ithin aspirations and intentions is a shoreless
ocean that very few people are saved from. W hoever intends other than
the Face o f Allah with their actions or intends something other than a
nearness to Him and His recompense has committed polytheism in their
intention and aspirations. Sincerity is to purify your devotion to Allah
alone in your statements, actions aspirations and intentions. This is the
upright creed o f Ibrahim (Abraham) that Allah ordered every one o f His
servants with, and none other than it is acceptable to Allah. It is the true
reality o f Islam,

“W hoever seeks other than Islam as a religion, it shall not be
accepted from him and in the Hereafter he w ill be o f the losers.”
[al- Imran:85].
It is the creed o f Ibrahim (Abraham), that deems anyone w ho diverges
from it to be o f the feebleminded ones.

297

The Reality o f Polytheism Is T hrough
Resembling the Creation to the Creator and the
Creator to the Creation
If you have come to know and understand this aforementioned prelude,
the gateway has now become open for you to receive the answer for the
question at hand. Thus, we say -an d it is from Allah alone we receive
correct judgm entthe essence o f polytheism is in resembling something or someone to the
Creator and resembling the creation to Him. This is the creed o f
(Tashbih) in its true form. Is consists o f negating Allah’s perfect
Attributes that He described Himself with and the perfect Attributes His
Messenger described Him with. So the one whose heart Allah has caused
to invert has reversed the truth, caused blindness in his insight along
with a mix-up o f the reality. This individual believed the realization o f
ta it’hid (monotheism) to be in the creed o f resemblance and that it is in
reality a glorification and act o f obedience.
Hence, the polytheist is someone who resembles the creation to the
Creator in matters that are exclusive to Him. Amongst the things that
belong exclusively to Allah is His oneness in Sovereignty, harm, benefit,
provision and deprivation and they all necessitate that any supplication,
fear, hope and reliance must be directed to Him. Therefore, whoever
attaches these affairs to any part o f the creation has resembled it to the
Creator in that he has resembled someone or something that is unable
to bring benefit or repel harm from himself, nor does he possess the
ability to cause himself to die or bring himself to life or resurrection, let
alone have the ability to do this to someone else with the O ne who is
299

The Disease A n d The Cure

control o f every affair. The reigns o f every affair are in His Hands, and
they all return to Him, so whatever He wills takes place and whatever
He does not will shall never take place. There is none who can deprive
if He gives, and there is none who can give if He has deprived. In fact,
if He opens His door o f Mercy before His servant, none other than Him
can withhold it and if He withholds it, none other than Him can release
it. So it is from the most heinous acts o f resemblance to liken this
creation that is incapable and destitute by nature to the O ne who is selfsufficient and able to do all things.
Likewise, amongst the distinguishing aspects o f divinity is ultimate
perfection from every angle w ithout deficiency from any perspective.
This necessitates that any worship must be directed to Him alone
including glory, veneration, fear, invocation, hope, repentance, reliance,
requesting aid, utmost servitude alongside utmost love should all be
directed to Him in accordance with legislation and a hum an’s natural
inclination. It is also intellectually and naturally inconceivable for such
actions to be devoted to anyone else. Therefore, whoever offers such
deed to someone else has resembled this other entity with the O ne W ho
is unlike anything from the creation W ho possess no partners. This is
the vilest form o f resemblance and the most invalid. Due to the severity
o f this vileness and its inclusion o f the pinnacle o f all oppression, Allah
has informed His servants that He shall never forgive it even though He
Has ordained Himself with Perfect Mercy.
Also, from the distinguishing aspects o f divinity is the worship that is
directed to him through the two pillars that act as the main framework
for it: utmost love alongside utmost submissiveness. This is the worship
in its in its fullest form, and the variation in levels amongst the people
depends on their level o f adherence to these two foundations. W hoever
offers their love, submission and humility to other than Allah has likened
Him in one of His sole rights, which is something impossible for any

300

The Disease A n d The Cure

divine legislation to present, and its vileness is deep-rooted in the natural
inclination and intellects o f mankind. But the devils have warped the
natural inclinations and intellects o f much o f the creation, corrupted,
and misguided them. As for those w hom the best reward has been
prescribed for them, they continued along the path o f sound inclination
and Allah sent Messengers to them and revealed the scriptures to them
that correspond to their natural inclination and intellects. Consequently,
they receive compound light upon light:
0 ills

S

i ©

“Allah guides to His light w hom soever He w ills.” [An-Nur:35]
If one acknowledges this, then know that the other distinctive aspects o f
divinity consist o f prostration. Thus, whoever prostrates to other than
Allah has likened that creation (being prostrated before) to Him.
Also, from them is reliance. Thus, whoever relies on other than Allah
has likened this creation to Him. Also, from them is repentance. So
whoever repents to other than Allah has likened this creation to Him.
Likewise, from them is making an oath by a name in honor and
glorification o f that name. So whoever makes an oath by other than
Allah has likened that creation to Him. This is far as ‘resemblance’ is
concerned.
As for o f likening oneself to the Lord, then whoever behaves as if
superior to the rest, or arrogantly and entices the people to exceedingly
praise and glorify him whilst requesting their submissiveness to him,
having hope in him and directing the hearts to fear, hope, seek security
and aid from him has likened himself to Allah. He has challenged Him
in His lordship and worship. Hence, he is deserving o f the utmost
degradation and humiliation from Allah dropping him to a level beneath
the feet o f His creation. In the Sahlh, al-BukharT reports that the

301

The Disease A n d The Cure

Messenger o f Allah^ said: “Allah says: ‘H onor is My lzar and Pride is
My Cloak. W hoever vies with Me regarding one o f them, I shall
torm ent them .’”1
Since it is the case that the picture maker who fashions the picture with
his hands is the most severely punished on the Day o f Resurrection due
to his likening o f himself to Allah in the creation o f an image, what do
you think would be the case for someone w ho vies with Allah in His
Lordship and worship? The Messenger said: “The most severely
punished people on the Day ol Resurrection are the picture makers, it
will be said to them: ‘Give life to what you have fashioned .’”2
Furthermore, al-BukharT reports in his Salrih that the Messenger o f
Allah^ said: “W ho is a more unjust than one who tries to create a
creation like Mine? Let him create an atom! O r a grain o f w heat !”3 Here,
He cautions using the example o f the atom or the grain also implying
anything greater than that.
The intended point here is to highlight the condition o f those who have
taken a resemblance to Him through fashioning a picture o f a living
being, and how heinous it would be to go further than that and liken
themselves in His Lordship and worship. The same applies for the one
who resembles Him in a name that only Allah is truly deserving of, such
as M alik a l-A ittla k (King o f Kings) or H akim a l-H ukkam (Judge o f all
judges) and the likes.

who passes His judgm ent on them all.

U ncovering a Reality in This Topic
Therefore, if the previously m entioned segment has been understood,
here is a further mighty foundation that uncovers a subtle point on this
topic. It is that the greatest sin against Allah is to have evil assumptions
about Allah, as the one who harbors these evil assumptions carry consist
o f thoughts that do not meet Allah’s perfection, and this individual has
thought o f notions that are contradictory to His Names and Attributes.
It is why Allah has severely threatened those who harbor such evil
assumptions about Him in a manner He has not done with others. He
said that their recompense is:

“And that was your assumption that you assumed about your Lord.
It has brought you to ruin and you have becom e am ong the
losers.” [Fussilat:23]
Allah has also informed about the address that Prophet Ibrahim made to
his people.
He said:

305

The Disease A n d The Cure

“And w hen he said, ‘W hat do you worship. Is it falsehood as deities
other than Allah you desire? W hat are your thoughts about the
Lord o f creation.’” [As-Saffat:85-87]
W hat do you assume He will recompense you with when you meet Him
having worshipped other than Him? And what are your assumptions o f
Him that have led you to worship other than Him? And what deficiency
do you think are within His Names and Attributes and Lordship that has
taken you to the extent o f worshipping other than Him? If only you had
thought what is correct and appropriate that He is aware o f all things,
able to do anything, self-sufficient, everything else is in need o f Him,
applies perfect justice over the creation, alone in absolute control o f
creation w ithout a partner, knowledgeable o f every detail and nothing
escapes His knowledge, self-sufficient over His servants without having
a need for any assistance, Merciful in essence and not in need o f anyone
to show His mercy. This is contrary to the one who is reigned over and
other than them from the leaders as they are in need o f others to inform
them about the affairs o f their subjects and their needs, and they are in
need o f others to assist them in accomplishing their needs or mediating
to attain their mercy and kindness. Therefore, they are in need o f
intermediaries as a matter o f necessity and due to their limited
capabilities, weaknesses and limited knowledge.
As for The O ne who is able to do all things, self-sufficient, possesses
knowledge o f everything, Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahlm, W hose mercy
encompassed everything, including any intermediaries between Him
and His creation is a disparagement o f His Lordship, worship and
oneness and an evil assumption about Him. It would never be legislated
by Allah and inconceivable to the minds and natural inclinations and

306

The Disease A m i The Cure

something well resounding in the sound minds and at the pinnacle o f
everything that is vile.
This is further clarified in that the worshipper is venerating the one he
worships, deifying it, submissive and humble before it. W hile it is The
Lord Most High alone W ho holds the sole right to this utmost
glorification, veneration, deification, submissiveness and humbleness.
This is His exclusive right and it is the most despicable o f all injustices
to offer this right to someone else or to associate partners with Him,
especially since the one who has been set as a partner falsely is His servant
and subject, as Allah said:

Thus, the one who worships something that is unable to even create the
weakest and smallest o f creatures besides Allah has not truly considered
Allah, and if this fly escapes with something o f the worshippers, he
would not be able to retrieve it from him. Allah says:

ric l i t

“T hey have not truly considered Allah, w hile the earth entirely
w ill be w ithin His grasp on the day o f resurrection, and the
heavens w ill be folded in His Right Hand. Exalted is He and
perfect above w hat they associate w ith H im .” [Az-Zumar:67]
The one who associates partners with Him in His worship with a false
partner who does not possess any o f these attributes in the least has not
truly considered the One W ho has this status and glory. In fact, they are
weak and incapable! The person who associates a partner that is weak
and lowly has not truly considered the O ne W ho is Perfect in Power
and Might!

Likewise, others who have not truly considered Allah are those who say:
He did not send Messengers to the creation nor did He reveal any Books.
Instead, ascribing Him to things that are unbefitting and inappropriate
for Him to do, such as neglecting His creatures and leaving them with
command or prohibition, squandering them, leaving them w ithout
purpose and creating them in vain and play.
Also, from those who have not truly considered Him are those who
negate the meanings o f His perfect Names and Attributes, negating His
Hearing and Sight, His Will and Choice, His Loftiness above His
creation, His Speech whenever He wills to whomsoever He Wills or
[the one who] negates His ability over the actions o f His servants from
obedience and piety whilst excluding it from being under His Power,
Will and creation deeming that they create whatever they will o f their
own actions w ithout the Will o f The Lord. This entails from them that
occurrences that Allah does not will take place within His kingdom, and
things that He does not Will actually occur! Allah is exalted above the
statements o f such people who resemble the pagans.
Also, those who do not truly consider Allah say: He punishes His
servants for things they have not done nor have any influence in at all
and that it is the action o f the Lord Himself. Thus, He punishes His
servants for His own actions and it is the Lord who has compelled the
person to carry it out and that this compulsion is greater than an
individual forcing someone else to do something. Bear in mind that it is
something firmly established in the sound inclination that if a master
forces his ow n slave to do something or does not allow him any other
alternative but to carry it out, yet punishes him for doing it, it would be
deemed as a reprehensible act. So how then could it ever be feasible for
the Most Just, The Most Wise and The Most Merciful to ever compel
His servants to do something that the servant has no influence in and
then punish him for it? Allah is far elevated over any imperfection. The

309

The Disease A n d The Cure

notion and statement o f such people is evil and reminiscent o f the pagan
belief, whilst both parties have not truly considered Allah as they should.
Likewise, others who have not truly considered Allah are those who fail
to elevate Him from a well or a bush or any other place. Instead, they
believe He dwells in every place and negate the belief He is above His
Throne and that the good word rises to Him along with the righteous
actions, and the Angels and Jibrll ascend to Him and descend from Him,
or that He controls every affair from above the heavens to the earth.
Such people have failed to elevate Him to the station o f Sovereign King
and instead placed Him in every place that a human or even an animal
would refuse to be in.
Likewise, others who have not truly considered Allah are those who
negate the actual meaning o f His Attribute o f Love, Mercy,
Compassion, Pleasure, Anger and W rath or those who negate the actual
meaning o f His W isdom which entails every praiseworthy objective or
those who negate the reality o f His actions and minus Him o f any action
to occur through His will power, or deem His actions as being separate
entities from Him or His ascension above the Throne, or Speaking to
Prophet Musa [Moses] by the side o f A t- T u r mountain or negating that
Allah will come on the day o f resurrection to pass the final judgm ent on
the Day o f Resurrection and other than that from His Perfect Actions
and Attributes that they have negated whilst they claim that they are
truly considering the status o f Allah by such negations.
The one who believes He has a partner and a son has not truly
considered Him, nor does the one who believes he merges within the
creation or that Allah and the creation are one entity.
Likewise, they have not truly considered Allah, those who say: He
elevated the enemies o f His Messenger due to them being from his
bloodline and household, raised their mention and granted them rule,
caliphate status and honor while He has debased the true allies o f his
310

The Disease A n d The Cure

household, degraded, humiliated them and left them in a state o f
dishonor wherever they may be. This entails the ultimate maligning o f
the Lord. Far elevated is He from the statements o f the rafidah (extreme
S h i’ite).

This type o f statement is derived from the statement o f the Jews and the
Christians about the Lord o f creation. [They claim concerning the
Prophet] Allah sent forth an unjust king who claimed prophet-hood for
himself, lied against Allah and lived through a lengthy period o f time
lying against Him whilst proclaiming: The Lord said such and such, He
commands with such and such, He prohibits such and such. He proceeds
in abrogating the legislations o f the Prophets and Messengers whilst
declaring the blood, wealth and women o f their followers as lawful for
him. He says: Allah has legitimized it for me! Yet the Lord allows him
to prevail, assists him, raises him, honors him, responds to his
invocations, empowers him over his opposition, establishes the proofs
for his truthfulness. None rise to become his enemy except that he
conquers them, and he testifies to this through His statements and
actions and approval whilst gradually presenting the proofs. Clearly,
such a statement entails the most abhorrent disparagement o f the Lord
and His Knowledge, Wisdom, Mercy and Lordship. Far elevated is Allah
above the statements o f the rejectionists.
Compare between the above statement and the statement before it from
their rafidah (extreme S h i’ite) brethren and you will find both o f them:
Suckling from the m ilk of one mother that they share — an oath we make to
never separate

Additionally, the one who says the following has not truly considered
Allah: It is lawfully legislated that He punishes His allies and anyone else
who does not disobey Him for as much as a blink o f an eye then throws
them into the Hellfire, whilst He admits His enemies and those who did
not believe in Him for as little as a blink o f an eye into the abode o f bliss
311

The Disease A n d The Cure

whilst both scenarios are o f no difference. However, the pure revelation
informs us o f otherwise. W e deem this above statement to be implausible
due to the revelation and not because it is in opposition to His W isdom
and Justice. Allah The Most Sublime Has absolutely rejected this notion
in His Book and declared such a judgm ent as the worst o f judgments.
He has not truly considered Allah, the one who claims that The Lord
will not or cannot revive the dead, or resurrect them from their graves,
or gather His creation on a day to recompense the good-doer for the
good they have done and recompense the evil-doer for their evil on a
day the oppressed will retrieve his rights from the one who oppressed
him, or honor the one who bore the difficulties in this life for His sake
and in pursuit o f His pleasure with the best reward, clarify to them that
wherein they differed over and make those who disbelieved know that
they were the liars.
He has not truly considered Allah, the one who belittles the command
o f Allah and disobeys Him, violates His prohibitions and partakes in
them, does not fulfill His rights and squanders them, abandons His
remembrance and neglects it with his heart heedless o f it whilst his
desires are more preferred to him than the pleasure o f Allah and the
obedience to another creation is more important to him than obedience
to Allah. Thus, he affords Allah with the surplus o f what is left in his
heart, speech and actions whilst placing his desires at the forefront
because that is what is important to him. He also trivializes the
watchfulness o f Allah over him whilst this individual is within His grasp.
But he values the watchfulness o f other members o f the creation with
his entire heart and every limb. He shies away from the people but does
not shy from Allah. He deals with the creation to the best o f his ability
but when he deals with Allah, he offers the most insignificant and
debased thing he has. If he sets out in serving his beloved deity from
mankind, he does so with all seriousness, endeavor and sincere counsel.
312

The Disease A n d The Cure

But if he sets out to offer the right o f his Lord - i f it happens- he does so
in a fashion that not even someone like him amongst the creation would
be satisfied with whilst proceeding to make an offering from his own
wealth that he would be embarrassed to give to a creature like himself!
Has this person who possesses such attributes truly considered his Lord?
Has he who sets an equal partnership between Him and His enemy in
an exclusive right that should be delivered to Him from veneration,
glorification, obedience, humility, submissiveness, fear and hope truly
considered Allah? If this individual rivaled the Lord’s closest creation to
Him as a partner, it would have been an audacious and unjust act against
His exclusive right, a trivialization o f His eminence and a partnership
between Him and someone else who is undeserving o f it. So how are
we to consider a partnership set by this individual between the Lord and
His most despised creation to Him, the most insignificant and detested.
His true enemy, as there hasn’t been anything worshipped besides Allah
except that it is the devil himself, as Allah said:

“Did I not enjoin upon you, children o f Adam, that you not
worship Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enem y. And that you
should worship Me alone. That is a Straight Path.” [Ya Sin:60-6l]
W hen the polytheists worshipped the Angels -as they claim- it was
actually worship that was offered to the Satan whilst they thought they
were worshipping the Angels. As Allah said:

313

The Disease A nd The Cure

“And m ention the day w hen He w ill gather them all and then say
to the Angels, ‘Did these ones used to worship you?’ They w ill say:
‘Exalted are You! You are our benefactor, not them. Rather, they
used to worship the jin n , most o f them believed in them .”’
[Saba’:40-4l]
Satan invites the polytheist to worship him and gives the illusion that he
is an Angel.
Also, the worshippers o f the sun, moon and celestial figures claim that
they worship the spirits within these bodies, and it is the same spirits that
address them and fulfill their needs. This is why Satan meets the sunrise
and why the disbelievers prostrate to it simultaneously prostrating before
Satan as well. This is also repeated at sunset. And those who worship the
Messiah ‘Isa [Jesus] and his mother are not actually worshipping them.
Instead, they worship the devil because he has made the assertion that
they worship whomever he orders them to worship, is pleased with it
and he commanded them to do so. This is the accursed Satan and
certainly not the servant o f Allah and His Messenger.
Apply the above to the statement o f Allah:

“Did I not enjoin upon you, children o f Adam, that you not
worship Satan.” [Ya Sin:60]
Hence, no one from the children o f Adam has every worshipped
anything besides Allah, whatever it may be, except that it is a concurrent
worship o f Satan. Therefore, the worshipper gains pleasure from the
worshipped by attaining his objective, and the worshipped gains
314

The Disease A nti The Cure

pleasure in the false glorification and partnership with Allah he receives,
which is the ultimate desire o f Satan. Allah says:
“And the day w hen He w ill gather them together [and say],
‘Assembly o f the jin n , you have misled m any o f m ankind.’” i.e.,
deviated and misguided them.

wills. Indeed, your Lord is W ise and K n o w in g .” [al-An am:128]
W hat has preceded is a subtle indication to the reason that has set
polytheism as the gravest sin before Allah. He does not forgive it w ithout
repentance from the perpetrator and it warrants an eternal existence in
the Hellfire. Its impermissibility and vileness does not just am ount from
its prohibition, but in fact it is inconceivable that Allah ever legitimize a
deity besides Himself as it would also be inconceivable for Him to ever
contradict His perfect Attributes. How can anyone ever assume that the
O ne W ho is alone in Lordship, worship and glorification permits a
partnership in all o f this? Far elevated and free is Allah from that.

315

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Reason Polytheism Is the Gravest Sin
Polytheism is the gravest act to contradict the purpose that Allah created
the creation to fulfill and legislated the commands for, and for this reason
it is the greatest o f all the major sins before Allah. As well as arrogance
and its effects as previously mentioned. Indeed, Allah created the
creation and revealed the Books so He can be singled out in absolute
obedience, whilst polytheism and arrogance negate this. Thus, Allah has
forbidden Paradise for the polytheists and nobody with an atoms weight
o f arrogance shall enter it.

317

The Disease A n d The Cure

Speaking About Allah W ithout Knowledge
An affair that equates to both o f the above in their evil effects is speaking
about Allah in His Names, Attributes and Actions, describing Him with
something contrary to how He described Himself and how His
messenger described Him w ithout knowledge. It is the ultimate
contradiction and negation o f the perfection o f the O ne W ho created
the creation and revealed the scriptures and it is a vilification against His
Lordship and sole rights as the Lord. If this act occurs based on
knowledge, it is a form o f stubbornness worse than polytheism and a
graver sin against Allah. Certainly, the polytheist who acknowledges the
Attributes o f the Lord is better than the one who negates and rejects His
perfect Attributes. As the individual who acknowledges sovereignty for
a king without rejecting his sovereignty or the attributes that qualify
him to be a king but sets up a partner with this king to use as an
intermediary that draws him closer to the king is better than the one
who rejects the attributes o f sovereignty for the king and any other
attribute that qualifies him for it.
This matter is resounding in the intellects and natural inclinations of
people. W here does a maligning and complete rejection o f His perfect
Attributes compare to setting up an intermediary between the only One
who is worshipped in truth and the worshipper through which he uses
as an object o f worship in the false attempt at glorification and honor o f
it? So the illness o f rejection is a terminal illness that does not have a
remedy. It is why Allah so clearly elaborated on the affair o f the chief
rejectionist, Fir’awn (the Pharoah). He rejected what Musa (Moses)
informed him o f about his Lord being above the heavens, he said:

319

The Disease A n d The Cure

“O Haman, construct me a tow er so I may reach the paths, the
paths o f the heavens so I may see the deity o f Musa, but indeed I
think he is a liar.” [Ghafir:36-37]
Al-Shaykh Abul-Hassan al-Ash'ari used this verse in his authorships as a
proof against the rejecdonists and I have quoted the phrases he used in
some o f my other books. In summary, both speaking about Allah
w ithout knowledge and polytheism are two inseparable matters.

320

The Disease A n d The Cure

Innovations Are More Beloved to Iblis (Satan)
Than Sins
Since such misguiding innovations am ount to nothing but ignorance o f
the Attributes o f Allah, and a stubborn and ignorant denial o f the
revelation that Allah has informed us o f about Himself and what His
Messenger has informed us of, it is therefore considered the worst o f the
major sins - i f it has not reached the stage o f unbelief- and becomes more
beloved to Iblis (Satan) than the major sins that are void o f innovation.
Some o f the Pious Predecessors (Salaf) would say: “Innovation is more
beloved to Iblis (Satan) than sins, because sins are repented from and
innovation is not repented from.” Iblis (Satan) himself said: “I ruined the
children o f Adam through sins, and they ruined me by seeking
forgiveness and with “La Ilaha Ilia Allah” (There is no deity worthy of
worship except Allah), so when I saw this, I spread innovations amongst
them so they may sin through them and not repent, because they deem
that they are doing good!”
Nonetheless, it is known that the sinner harms himself. As for the
innovator, his harm exceeds onto others. In addition, the innovator’s
issue lies in the foundations o f the religion, whereas the sinner’s issues
lie in a desire. The innovator has set himself in wait on the straight path
o f Allah to obstruct others from it, but the sinner has not done so. The
innovator maligns the Attributes and the perfection o f the Lord, whereas
the sinner does not do so. The innovator attempts to invalidate what the
Messenger has been sent with, whereas the sinner’s case is not the same.
The innovator hinders the path to the Hereafter for others whilst the
sinner is slow to move along this path due to his sins.

321

The Disease A n d The Cure

Transgression Against Others and Oppression
Are Also from the Gravest Sins
Oppression and transgression both oppose the justice that the heavens
and earth were created to facilitate, the reason the Messengers were sent
to their people and the reason the Books and Scriptures were sent to the
people for them to act by. Therefore, it assumed the position o f one o f
the most major sins before Allah and the level o f its severity is specifically
determined in accordance to its evil.
M urdering one’s own small and innocent child whilst Allah has created
the hearts o f the creatures to treat them with mercy and inclined the
hearts to be kind to them whilst He has distinguished the parents with
clear distinction in this, yet the parent murdering this child in fear that
they share a portion o f their food, drink or wealth with them is from the
most heinous forms o f oppression imaginable. The same applies in the
reverse manner. The enormity o f the crime is the same in the case that
a child murders his or her own parents who were the sole reasons for
their existence, and likewise any m urder o f a relative.
The degrees o f murder vary in severity depending on the vileness o f the
crime and how vigilant the murderer should have been in protecting the
life o f the victim. Thus, the most severely punished on the day o f
resurrection is the one w ho murders a Prophet or is executed by one.
This is followed in severity by one who murders a leader or a scholar
w ho orders the people to establish justice and invites them to Allah and
sincerely counsels them in their religion.
Allah has ordained that the recompense for the one who intentionally
murders an innocent, believing soul is a prolonged existence in the
323

The Disease A n d The Cure

Hellfire, whilst the Lord becomes Angry with that murderer, decrees a
curse upon him and prepares a painful torm ent for them. This is the
outcome for the one who intentionally murders a believer as long as
there is no preventative for the perpetrator to receive this recompense.
And there is a unanimous agreement that voluntarily and willingly
embracing the religion o f Islam after the perpetration or murder is a
preventative from receiving such recompense in the Hereafter.
However, does the repentance o f a Muslim prevent from such
recompense? There are two opinions amongst the scholars o f the Pious
Predecessors (Salaf) and their successors in this regard, and both are
narrations from al-Imam Ahmad.
Those who say: This person’s repentance does not prevent the
establishment o f the recompense, deem that it is the victim’s right that
he did not receive in the worldly life as he left this life as someone who
has been oppressed. Therefore, he must receive it in the abode ofjustice
(the Hereafter).
They go on to say: The right that the victim’s next o f kin receives is his
own exclusive right that Allah has given him a choice in between
receiving it or pardoning. However, the victim does not benefit from
his next o f kin receiving their rights. Also, which injustice has the victim
been relieved o f through the rights o f their next o f kin being afforded
to them?
This is the more authentic o f the two opinions in this matter. It is that
the right o f the murdered victim is not fulfilled through the next o f kin
receiving theirs. These narrations have been reported through the
students o f al-Imam Ahmad and al-Imam As-Shafi’i respectively.
There is another group who declare that the recompense no longer
applies after repentance and justice has been afforded to the next o f kin
o f the victim, because repentance abolishes any evil that preceded it, and

324

The Disease A n d The Cure

the legislated penalty has been established on the one who committed
the crime.
They continue to justify this by saying: If repentance eliminates any
residue o f disbelief, sorcery and what is even worse than murder, how
can it then fail to eradicate the effects o f murder? Allah accepted the
repentance o f the disbelievers (at the time) who murdered His faithful
allies and decreed thereafter that they become from His most elite
servants and also invited those w ho charred His faithful allies and
painfully trialed them to leave their religion o f Islam to repent.
He said:

©
“Say: ‘My servants w ho have transgressed against them selves, do
not despair o f the Mercy o f Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins.”’
[Az-Zumar:53]
This verse is in reference to the repentant one, and it encompasses
disbelief and anything less.
They also say: How can someone repent from a sin and then be punished
for it after repentance? This is something contradictory in the legislation
and recompense o f Allah.
They go on to clarify: The repentance for such an individual is to
surrender himself or herself, but it is impossible to surrender oneself to
the murdered victim, so the legislation has placed his next o f kin in place
o f the victim and made the surrender to them equivalent to surrendering
to the murdered victim. This is analogous to the scenario in which
wealth is handed to the family o f the one w ho is owed (after death). It is
in place o f handing it to the person who is owed.
325

The Disease A n d The Cure

After careful scrutiny o f the matter, it is true that murder is related to
three separate rights: a right to Allah, a right to the murdered victim and
a right to the heir. So if the culprit willingly surrenders in remorse for
what they have committed in fear o f Allah and in sincere repentance, in
this case the right o f Allah has been fulfilled. As for the right o f the heir,
it is afforded either by establishing the legislated penalty, reconciliation
or forgiveness. This leaves the right o f the deceased who will be
compensated by Allah on the Day o f Resurrection on behalf o f his
remorseful and righteous servant rectifying between the perpetrator and
the victim. So the victim’s rights are not squandered and neither is the
repentance invalid.
As for the matter of money, the scholars have also differed in it. A group
o f them said: If the one who has taken the money has paid the money
back to the heir, he is exonerated in the Hereafter just as he becomes
exonerated in the worldly life.
Another group o f them declare: The demand is from the one who was
oppressed who will retrieve what is owed to him on the Day o f
Resurrection whilst he is unable to do this if his heir receives the money
in his place. The victim was prevented from taking advantage o f his own
wealth during his life and died w ithout benefiting from it. This is
oppression he has not been relieved from, rather, others have benefited
from it.
Upon this understanding, the second group o f scholars has derived that
if ownership transfers from person to person and the heirs to the wealth
multiply, they all have a right to it because it was a right that should have
been paid to them all, as they are all inheritors. This opinion is one o f a
group o f companions o f Malik and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.
O ur Shaykh (ibn TaymTyah) has elaborated in some detail regarding the
position o f both parties, he said: “If the person who is owed the wealth
was able to take back their wealth or demand it but did not do so until
326

The Disease A n d The Cure

he passed away, the right still remains for him to demand in the
Hereafter, as would be the case in the worldly life. If he was unable to
demand it or retrieve it and something o f an injustice or transgression
obstructed him from obtaining it, he can repeat this demand in the
Hereafter.
This is the best study o f the matter that can be said. If the wealth is used
by the oppressor and the heir is unable to retrieve it, the scenario
becomes principally equal to a situation whereby the person has a
servant who was murdered by a stranger, or his home that was burnt
down by someone else, or his food and drink that was consumed by
someone else. All this is a loss for the heir to the money and the right to
demand rests with the one who has lost the possession.
The following is left to say: II the wealth was in the form o f an estate, or
land or an existing and w orking possession after the death o f the rightful
owner, it belongs to the heir and the oppressor must provide the rightful
owner with the returns. If he fails to do so, the heir can demand it before
Allah just as it is demanded from him in the worldly life.
Nonetheless, a powerful question poses itself that cannot be answered
except by saying: They are collectively entitled to demand it just as in
the case if wealth was unlawfully looted or an endow m ent was
unlawfully taken from a group o f people, they would all have a right to
demand it back and the demand could be made on the Day o f
Resurrection from them all and none would be more entitled to it than
anyone else. Allah knows best.

“Because o f that, W e decreed upon the Children o f Bra’ll that

earth - it is as ifh e had slain m ankind entirely. And w hoever saves

The understanding o f this has proved problematic to many people. They
say: It is well known that the misdeeds accumulated for m urdering onehundred people are more than earned for m urdering one person (so how
are they equal in the verse). This problem arose for them because they
correlated the quantity o f the sins with the punishment itself. However,
the statement itself does not provide this understanding and it is not
necessary that if something is resembled with something else they must
hold the same rulings. Allah said:
^

“O n the day they see w hat they were promised, it w ould be as if
they had not remained except an hour from a day.” [al-Ahqaf:35]
This does not necessitate that they lived in the worldly life for that length
of time.
The Prophet said: “W hoever prays the ‘Isha prayer in congregation, it is
as if he prayed for half the night. And whoever prays the Fajr prayer in
congregation, it is as if he has prayed the entire night.”1i.e., he prayed
both ‘Isha and Fajr in congregation as appears in another narration.
Clearer than this is the statement o f the Prophet: “W hoever fasts the
entirety o f Ramadan and follows it up with six days from Shawal, it
would be as if he has fasted the entire year,” 2 and his statement:
“W hoever recites the chapter o f Ikltlds is as if he has recited a third o f the
Q ur’an.”3
It is known that the reward for the one who carries out these actions
does not reach the reward for the action it has been resembled with, let
alone for it to even be equivalent. If the reward was equal, there would
be no advantage for the one who prays the ‘Isha and Fajr prayers in
congregation to rise during the night and pray apart from tiredness and
exhaustion.

No servant has been given anything greater after the virtue o f faith than
an understanding about Allah and His Messenger, these are the blessings
o f Allah, He affords to whosoever He wills.
If it is then said: W hat is the point in resembling the one w ho murdered
one person to someone who murdered mankind entirely? The answer:
from a number o f perspectives:
One: Each one is in defiance to Allah and His Messenger, in opposition
to His command and exposed to His punishment. Each one has gained
the Anger and curse o f Allah and qualified for an eternal abode in the
Hellfire and Allah has prepared a terrible torm ent for him despite the pits
o f Hell being at various depths. The sin of m urdering a Prophet or a just
leader or a scholar who commands the people to be just is not the same
as m urdering someone o f no distinction from amongst the masses.
Second: They are the same in that they both warrant capital punishment.
Third: They are equal in their audacity o f spilling blood unlawfully.
Undoubtedly, the one w ho murders a soul unjustly only to cause
corruption on the earth or to loot the victim’s wealth is also capable o f
m urdering anyone else they subdue. So this person is an enemy to
humanity.
Also, from another perspective: He is named and know n as a ‘murderer’,
‘corrupt’, ‘oppressor’ or ‘insolent’ due to his m urder o f one human, just
as he would be know n as such if he massacred the entire population o f
mankind.
Another perspective: Allah has made the believer like one body in their
love, mercy and relationships with one another; if one part o f it
complains, the rest o f the body suffers from fever and insomnia.
Therefore, if a murderer kills any part o f this body, it is as if he has killed
the remainder o f the body with it and caused pain to every limb.
W hoever harms one believer is as if he has harmed every believer, and
331

whoever harms every believer, it is as if he has harmed everyone, and
Allah repels harms from the people because o f the believers who are
amongst them whilst the harm that afflicts the guard is also harm to the
guarded.
The Prophet said: “N o soul is wrongfully taken except that some o f the
burden o f its blood is upon the first son o f Adam, because he was the
first to institute murder.”1This threat has not appeared against the first
one to fornicate, or the first to steal or the first to consume intoxicants,
even though it is a more befitting threat against the first polytheist
because he was the first to institute polytheism. Hence, the Prophet saw
the scenario in which ‘Amr bin Luhay was being punished in the most
torm enting manner in the Hellfire because he was the first to alter the
religion o f Ibrahim [Abraham]. Allah said:

“D o not be the first to disbelieve in H im .” [al-Baqarah:4l] i.e., do
not be the first in order to allow those w ho come after you to follow
you, consequently giving you a share o f the sin. The same principle
applies to the one who institutes an immoral act.
It has been recorded in A t-T irm idhr on the authority o f Ibn Abbas who
narrated from the Prophet that he said: “The victim will come along
with his killer on the Day o f Resurrection holding his head in his hand
with his jugular veins flowing with blood and saying: ‘O Lord, ask this
one: ‘W hy did he kill me?’” They then m entioned the option o f
repentance to Ibn Abbas and the verse:

The Ills o f Fornication and Adultery Follow
Those o f M urder in Severity
Since the ills o f fornication and adultery are amongst the worst and the
act itself is in defiance to the preservation o f lineage, safeguarding the
chastity o f the private parts, upholding sanctity and is a reason for great
animosity and hatred between the people due to the damage it spreads
to another person’s wife, daughter, sister and m other whereby an
enormous am ount o f disorder throughout the world occurs. It is
therefore closely associated to the ills o f killing in terms o f severity. This
is why Allah has related the two acts together in His Book, and the
Prophet has also done so in His traditions and statements as previously
mentioned.
Al-Imam Ahmad said: “I do not know o f any sin after murder that is
worse than fornication.”
Allah has reinforced its impermissibility in His Book by saying:

Here, He related murder and unlawful sexual intercourse together and
has decreed that the punishment for such an act will be a prolonged
existence in an intensified torment, as long as the perpetrator does not
remove this burden from himself through repentance, pure faith and
righteous deeds.

“And do not go near unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever
an immorality and is evil as a w ay.” [al-Isra:32]
He outlines its immoral nature, it is the despicable act that has reached a
level whereby its vileness is known to every sound mind and even the
animals, as al-BukharT has reported in his Sahih' on the authority of'A m r
bin Maymun al-Awdi who said: “In the time o f pre-lslamic ignorance I
saw a monkey fornicating with another monkey. So the other monkeys
gathered around them and pelted them with stones until they both died.”
Then, Allah mentioned that it is evil as a way as it is a destructive, ruined
and destitute path to be on in this life and a path o f torment, dishonor
and exemplary punishment in the Hereafter, whereas the sexual relations
performed with the father’s spouse is the worst o f its kind. He specified
its mention with additional dispraise and said:

“Indeed, it was an immorality and hated [by Allah] and was evil
as a w ay.” [An-Nisa:22]

from ill speech. And they w ho are observant o f Zakat. And they
w ho guard their private parts. Except from their w ives or those

This consists o f three affairs: W hoever does not guard their private parts

and they are o f the transgressors. Therefore, they lose out on success,
they warrant the label o f ‘transgressors’ and are blamed for their actions.
In reality, the pain o f w ithholding from the sexual urges and the struggle
therein is easier than some o f the above repercussions. Similar to this is
the description that Allah has given to man in that he was created
anxious and unable to be patient in times o f ease or hardship, when good
touches him he withholds it and when he is touched with evil, he is
impatient excluding those saved ones from His creation who are an
exception. He mentioned some o f them:

“And those w ho guard their private parts. Except from their wives
or those their right hand possesses, for indeed they are not to be
blamed. But w hoever seeks beyond that, then they are the
transgressors.” [al-M a’arij:29-3l]
Allah ordered His Prophet to command the believers to lower their gazes
and guard their chastity and to teach them that He sees all o f their actions
and is well aware o f them:
© j j j J j l j i U) J& L \ ills “He know s the traitorous glance and w hat the breasts conceal.”
[Ghafir:19].
Since the early stages o f unlawful sexual intercourse resonates from a
look, He declared that lowering the gaze takes precedence in order to
guarding the private parts, because such incidents originate from the
sight just as the majority o f fires ignite from small sparks. So it may be
one look, followed by another and another, then the major offence. This
is why it is said that whoever safeguards four things completes their
religion: the glances o f eye, the thoughts that cross the mind and the
statements and the steps. An individual should be his own gatekeeper at
these four doors and remain stationed on guard at these openings
because it is through them that the enemy enters and probes into the
dwelling before completely destroying what they have taken over.

340

Four Entryways for Sins
Sins predominantly creep into an individual through these four passages
and we shall mention a segment for each one respectively:
T h e G lance
As for the glance, it is the director and guide for desires, and
safeguarding it is the starting point for safeguarding the private parts,
because whoever is careless in their glances shall find that they lead them
to ruin. The Prophet said: “Do not follow one [unlawful] glance with
the other, the first [accidental] one is for you [unaccounted for] and the
second is not.”' Also, in the M usnad o f al-Imam Ahmad: The Prophet
said: “The [unlawful] glance is a poisoned arrow from the arrows o f Iblis
[Satan]. W hoever diverts their gaze from the appearances o f women for
the sake o f Allah, Allah will cast sweetness in their heart until the day he
meets H im .” This is the meaning o f the statement.
The Prophet said: “Divert your gaze and safeguard your private parts.”2
He also said: “Beware o f assembling along the pathways.” The people
said: “Messenger o f Allah
we only have them as sitting places.” The
Messenger o f Allah^ said: “If you must, then observe the rights o f the
way.” They asked, "W hat are the rights o f the way?" He said: “To lower

The Disease A nd The Cure

your gaze [from what is unlawful to look at], abstain from harm and
return greetings.”'
The glances are the initial foundation for the incidents that affect an
individual, because the glance gives rise to a thought, then the thought
gives birth to an idea, an idea evokes a desire and the desire develops a
crave, then this craving intensifies and becomes resolute conviction
which inevitably results in the action as there is no intervention. In this
regard, it has been said: “Patience upon lowering the gaze is easier than
patience upon the pain o f what happens after it.” The poet said:
Every incident’s beginning is from a glance — and the majority o f fires are
from a small spark
H ow many glances have reached within the heart — where the arrow has
reached, but without a bow or a shooters hand
A s long as the servant persists in glancing — he is subject to the danger
H e satisfies his eyes with harm to his heart — unwelcomed is a joy that
results in harm

From the plights o f such glances is that they produce sorrow, sighs of
regret and burning aguish. He sees what he is unable to obtain or able
to resist. It is one o f the most painful torments to witness something you
are unable to resist and unable to be patient w ithout and unable to have
at the same time.
The poet wrote:
Whenever you send your sight forth to lead — to your heart, the sights have
troubled you
You see what you cannot have — nor can you resist from part o f it

1 C o lle c te d b y al-B ukharT [2465] a n d M uslim [2121].

342

The Disease A n d The Cure

This stanza requires an explanation. It means that you see something
you are unable to resist yet you cannot obtain anything from it. His
words ‘what you cannot have’ are a negation o f his ability to obtain all of
it that can be negated through a person’s lack o f ability to obtain any
part o f it. How many have indulged their glances and refused to refrain
until they found themselves in the midst o f them as a fatality, as the poet
wrote:
O ’ you who is glaring, you did not refrain from looking — until you were in
their midst as one of the dead

1 also have some lines o f poetry 1 have written:
He became bored of safety and his glances enhanced — standing by a ruined
home, yet he thinks it’s beautiful
H e continues to glance one after the other — until he ruins himself in
between the glances

From the peculiar affairs is that a person’s glance does not reach the one
being glanced at until it holds a position in the heart o f the one who is
glancing. I have written some lines in this regard:
O ’ the one who throws the arrows of their glances in all endeavor — you are
the fatality with what you throw without effort
The eye is sent forth constantly — withhold your messenger, let it not come
back to you with your own destruction

W hat is even more astounding is that a glance can injure the heart, and
this may be followed by multiple injuries. Eventually, the pain o f these
injuries will not prevent an individual from repeatedly glancing, and I
also have some poetry about this:
You continue to follow a glance with another — another follows every
pleasant sight

You think that it’s the remedy to your wound, but in fact — it is a wound to
another

regret.

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Passing T hought
As far as the passing thought is concerned, its affair is more serious,
because it is the beginning o f all good or evil and from it develops the
cravings, resolve and determination. Thus, whoever manages their
thoughts appropriately has taken control o f the soul’s reigns and subdued
their desires. But whoever allows their thoughts to defeat them will
surely be conquered even more by their desires and their soul, and
whoever underestimates their thoughts will find that they drive him to
his destruction. The thoughts will continue to frequent the heart until
they become fake ambitions, as Allah says:
ALi'ji jaJSS- alii

“Like a mirage in a lowland w hich a thirsty person thinks is water
until w hen he reaches it, he finds it is n oth in g but finds Allah
before him , and He will pay him in full his due, and Allah is swift
in account.” [An-Nur:39]
The most contemptible ones are those who are pleased with fake
ambitions over true reality and have invited them upon themselves and
adorn themselves in such a way. It is -b y Allah- the capital investment
o f the bankrupt and the business o f the idle. It is the sustenance for the
desolate souls that have become satisfied with a figment o f the
imagination over the worthwhile attainment, and with the fictitious
hopes over reality, as the poet said:

345

The Disease A nd The Cure

Wishes, if they were real, they would be the best wishes — and if not, we
would have lived through them a comfortable life

This is the most harmful aspect for an individual. It is produced from
inability and laziness and it further gives rise to sorrow and remorse.
W hen the wishful thinker misses out on directly partaking in his wishes
through his senses, he diverts to carve an image o f it on his heart, then
he embraces it and holds it tight. N ow he is convinced by an illusionary
and fantasized image that his imagination has conjured. However, this
does not avail him in any way. His similitude is like that o f a hungry and
thirsty person who imagines an image o f food and drink that he is
currently eating and drinking. Settling for this and submitting to it
indicates the lowliness o f the soul and its inferiority. The nobility o f a
soul, its righteousness, pureness and superiority is in banishing any
thought that holds no reality to it, and to never be satisfied that it should
cross the mind and abstain from it.
Thoughts are o f various categories and they revolve around four
foundations:
•
•
•
•

Thoughts that are
Thoughts that are
Thoughts that are
Thoughts that are

used to evoke some worldly benefits
used to repel some worldly harms
used to evoke some benefits for one’s afterlife
used to repel the harms o f the afterlife

One should restrict their thoughts, ideas and worries within these four
foundations. If one does so, they will not digress elsewhere. But if the
thoughts happen to accumulate, a person should put the most important
one forward which he fears will pass him by and postpone the less
important thought that he does not fear he will lose out on.
There are two other categories left to mention: One o f them is
important and should not be omitted, and the second one is not as
important but should also not be omitted. Each one possesses

346

The Disease A n d The Cure

characteristics that warrant it to be put first which is why hesitation and
confusion occur here. If one puts forth the more important one, he fears
on missing out on the one o f lesser importance, and if he puts forth the
one o f lesser importance, he misses out on working through the more
important one. Additionally, he is met with two issues that cannot be
combined together whilst one cannot take place without resigning the
other. Here is the time to use the intellect, understanding and knowhow.
It is due to the decisions made at this point that determine whose status
has been elevated, who succeeds and who loses out. The majority o f
those you find who glorify the intellects and their own know how prefer
the less important over the more important issue that cannot be omitted.
Nobody is actually completely free o f this, but there are those who do it
distinctly and frequently and there are others who rarely do it.
Nonetheless, there is a method o f arbitration for this, it is the
comprehensive principle that the legislation and the settled affairs
revolve around, and it is the reference point for the creation and the
revelation. It is to place precedence for the overwhelming benefit from
the options available, if this is not possible, then one chooses the benefit
at the lesser degree until he reaches the lesser o f the two evils in order to
repel the greater harm. Thus, he omits a benefit in order to reap one that
is greater than it, or he chooses an evil in order to avoid the greater evil.
The thoughts o f an intellectual do not surpass this, and the legislations
were revealed to accomplish this, bearing in mind that the benefits in
the worldly life and the Hereafter cannot be achieved in any other way.
The loftiest, most esteemed and beneficial thoughts are those that are for
Allah and the Hereafter. However, the thoughts for Allah are various
types:
One: The thoughts spent on His revealed verses, contemplating them
and understanding the intent from them. Such are the reasons that Allah
revealed them, not merely to be recited, as the recitation is a means for

347

The Disease A n d The Cure

the objective. Some o f the Pious Predecessors (Salaf) would say: “The
Q u r’an was revealed to be implemented, but people took its recitation
as the implementation.”
Second: The thoughts spent on His visible signs to take moral benefit
from them, use them as evidences for His Perfect Names and Attributes,
Perfect W isdom and Benevolence and His Perfect Grace and
Generosity. Allah has encouraged His servants to think about His signs,
ponder and understand them, whereas He has dispraised the heedless one
for not doing so.
Third: To think about His signs, His benevolence, His wide variety of
blessings on His creation and His vast Mercy, Forgiveness and
Forbearance.
The three above types produce the knowledge o f Allah, His love, a fear
o f Him and a hope in His reward within the heart and a continuity of
this thought-process alongside the remembrance o f Allah coats the heart
in knowledge and love.
Fourth: Thinking about the faults o f the soul, its ills and the deficiencies
in deeds. This type of thought is immensely beneficial. It is the gateway
to good and has a positive influence in breaking the soul that commands
with evil. W henever it breaks, the soul lives tranquilly, becomes
rejuvenated and regains control for itself. Thus, the heart is revived, and
its statements are now implemented within its kingdom and it sends its
troops in pursuit o f its benefit.
Fifth: The thoughts spent on how time must be spent, its role and
focusing totally on it. The knowledgeable one is he who truly lives the
moment, if it is squandered, so are his benefits. All benefits arise from
within time. Ifhe wastes it, he will never retrieve it again.
Al-Shafi I said: “I became acquainted with the Sufis, however I did not
benefit anything from them except two statements: O ne o f them is their
348

The Disease A n d The Cure

quote: “Time is a sword, you must cut it (make good use o f it) or else it
will cut you.’” He then mentioned their other quote.
An individual’s lifespan is made up o f the time he has. It is the primary
element in his eternal existence in the permanent abode o f bliss or the
eternal life o f despair in the painful torment, and it passes as swiftly as
the clouds. W hatever o f an individual’s life is spent for Allah and by
Allah’s laws, it is the true makeup o f his life. Anything other than that is
not considered a part o f his life, even if he lives a carefree life like the
animals. If an individual spends their time in heedlessness and delusional
aspirations, the best o f which is a life o f sleep and idleness, his death is
better for him than his life. Likewise, if the individual is in prayer, he
does not reap anything from it other than what is for Allah’s sake. Thus,
he does not gain anything from his life other than what is by Allah and
for Him.
A nything other than this from the passing thoughts and ideas are either
satanic whispers or fake aspirations and false ploys equivalent to the
thoughts that afflict the drunken, the spellbound and the obsessed. Their
state when reality strikes is like that o f the one who says:
I f m y place in the resurrection with you — and that’s all I find, I would have
wasted m y days.
A wish that was granted to m y soul for a period o f time — and today I see
that it was a m ixture of false dreams

Know that the passing o f a thought does not harm but summoning and
addressing it does. A thought is like a passerby on a path, if you do not
summon it and allow it to pass, it leaves you. But if you summon it, it
spell-bounds you with its conduct, its trickery and deception. This is the
easiest thing that could happen to the idle soul that is void o f any activity,
and the most difficult upon the honorable, lofty and reassured hearts and
souls.

349

The Disease A n d The Cure

Allah has placed a soul that commands with evil and a soul that is
reassured with good within the makeup o f mankind that are both on
opposite sides o f the spectrum. Anything that comes easy to one o f them
will be difficult on the other, and anything that one o f them finds
pleasurable, the other will find pain in. There is nothing harder against
the soul that commands with evil than implementing actions for the sake
o f Allah and valuing the attainment o f His pleasure over its own desires,
and at the same time there is nothing more beneficial for it. O n the other
hand, there is nothing more difficult for the reassured righteous soul
than implementing actions for other than Allah and responding to the
enticer o f desires whilst there is nothing more harmful to it than that.
The Angel continues to be on the right o f the heart whilst the devil is
on the left and the war is continuous, unrelenting until its time in this
world comes to an end. Wars have their appointed times before they
cease, all falsehood can be found with Satan and the soul that commands
evil, whilst all o f truth is with the sovereign King and the reassured
righteous soul. These battles are a matter o f contest, yet victory comes
with patience. Those who are patient, persevere, endure and have piety
towards Allah will have a good end in this life and the Hereafter. Allah
has decreed a judgm ent that He will not retract that the good end is in
piety and for the pious.
So the heart is an empty tablet and one’s thoughts are carvings that are
carved on it, so how can it befit someone with sound intellect to produce
their carvings from either lies, deception, trickery, fake aspirations and
a mirage that does not consist o f any reality? W hich form o f wisdom,
knowledge or guidance can ever be derived from such carvings? If an
individual desires to carve such attributes on the surface o f their heart, it
would be as if carving beneficial knowledge on an area that is occupied
with nonsense. Therefore, if the heart is not rid o f the disgraceful
thoughts, the beneficial ones will not settle therein, and they will not
settle on anywhere that is not pure, as once said:
350

The Disease A n d The Cure

Desires for her reached me before I knew what desire was — it encountered a
vacant heart and thus gained firm ground

Hence, many people o f great conduct have built their conduct upon the
safeguarding o f their feelings and senses and to disallow any unwanted
thoughts to find a firm grounding in their hearts so that the hearts
become void and willing to accept the true realities and greater affairs.
However, such individuals have safeguarded one thing and missed out
on others. They vacated their hearts o f any thoughts in totality, so their
hearts became empty and were met by Satan, and so he sowed the seeds
o f falsehood and gave them the impression that they are the highest and
noblest thoughts to have. He then placed them in exchange for the
thoughts that are the articles o f knowledge and guidance. Hence, if the
heart is empty o f the knowledge and guidance, Satan appears and finds
the place vacant and occupies the heart with whatever suits the person.
Since he is unable to occupy him with the vilest o f acts, he occupies him
with dedicating himself towards emptiness, wherein there is no benefit
or success in and that it should be the overwhelming feeling in the heart.
O ne should instead occupy himself with whatever Allah loves and is
pleased with and busy one’s ow n heart, know ing about this in detail
whilst finding the means to implement it. But Satan has bribed them to
leave this and reject it from the angle o f abstinence o f the worldly life
and undertaking necessary means in life and deluded them into thinking
that excellence can be sought in absolute emptiness. Impossible!
Excellence can only be found in filling the heart and the inner self with
the thoughts, desires and ideas that help one attain the pleasure o f the
Lord through the individual and the people and contemplating on the
methods to reach such a position. Those who have excelled the most are
the ones who are most frequently thinking and desiring this, just as the
nethermost ones are those who think and yearn the most to attain their
ow n desires wherever they may be. Allah’s aid is sought.

Here we have a fine example from Umar bin al-Khattab who would
have a congestion o f thoughts in how to please the Lord, perhaps they
would appear during his prayer, as he would contemplate on preparing
his army during the prayer com bining between both holy warfare and
the prayer. This is an example o f merging multiple acts o f worship into
one. It is an honorable and noble act that is only known to those who
are truthful in their pursuit, well versed in knowledge and someone o f
high ambitions whereby one can enter one act o f worship and profit
from multiple acts. They are the blessings o f Allah, He affords them to
whoever He wills.

The Utterances
As for utterances, the way to safeguard them is to not utter a loose word.
In fact, one should not say anything that does not allow him to gain an
advantage or profit in his religion. If one wishes to utter a word, he
should first ask: Is there a benefit to it? If there is not, he withholds; and
if there is, is there something better to say? If there is, he should not
waste it by saying something less beneficial.
If you ever w ant to provide an evidence for what the heart carries, use
the motions and speech o f the tongue as proof because it exposes what
is in the heart whether the individual wants to or not.
Yahya bin Mu adh said: “The hearts are like pots; they boil with
whatever is in them and the tongues are the spoons. Notice when a man
speaks because his tongue will scoop out whatever is in his heart: Sweet
or sour, pleasant or bitter or otherwise. The scoop o f the tongue
identifies the taste o f the heart.”
Just as you taste what is in the pot using your tongue that allows you to
gain real information, likewise you can taste what is in a person’s heart
from what appears on their tongue just as you taste the contents o f the
pot with your ow n tongue.
In a marfu narration on the authority o f Anas who said: “A person’s faith
will not be steadfast until their heart is steadfast, and their heart will not
be steadfast until their tongue is steadfast.”1

The Prophet was also asked about the thing that mostly casts the people
into the Hellfire, he replied: “The mouth and the private parts .”1 AtTirm idhl declared this narration as Sahih.
Mu adh bin Jabal asked the Prophet to enlighten him on an action that
will admit him into Paradise and distance him from the Hellfire. So the
Prophet informed him o f the head o f all matters, the pillar o f the religion
and the peak o f it all, then he said: “Shall 1 not inform you o f the
governing factor for all this?” I said, “Do inform, O Messenger o f Allah
So he took hold o f his tongue and said, (Restrain this). I said,
“Prophet o f Allah, will we be taken to account for what we say?” He
said, “May your mother be bereaved o f you [a statement used by the
Arabs to highlight the severity o f a matter], O Mu adh! Is there anything
that throws people into the Hellfire upon their faces — or: on their noses
— except the doing o f their tongues ?”2 A t-Tirm idhl declared this
narration as authentic. However, it is strange how a person can find it
easy to have restraint and show caution in consuming unlawful things,
com mitting oppression, theft, consuming alcohol and unlawfully
looking at things but finds it difficult to show precaution in the
statements o f the tongue. You may even find someone who is known
to be religious, have abstinence and be an avid worshipper yet he says
words that anger Allah that the individual does not pay attention to. He
slips-up due to one word a distance further than that between the east
and the west! How many people do you see who avoid the immoralities
and oppression due to their piety yet unleash their tongues in dishonor
o f the living and the dead w ithout caring about what he says! If you
truly want to know this, look into the narration that has been recorded

The Pious Predecessors would hold themselves to account for statements
such as: “Today it is hot, or today is cold.”
O n occasions, some o f the major scholars appeared [after their death] to
others in their dreams, and so they asked about their current condition.
They say: “I am being held to account for a statement I uttered. I said:
‘The people are in need o f rain!’ So it was said to me: ‘H ow do you
know? I am more aware o f the benefits o f My servants.’”
O ne o f the Companions said to his maid one day: “Bring the dining
table mat to use it in idle play.” Then he said: “1 seek forgiveness from
Allah, 1 never spoke a word except that I restrain it and place reigns on
it, except this statement I just uttered, it came out without restraints .”1
O r they were words to this effect.
The easiest movement to make is the movement o f the tongue whilst it
is also the most harmful to a person. The Pious Predecessors (Salaf) have
differed as to whether every utterance o f the tongue is recorded amongst
the deeds, or is it only the good and the evil that is recorded? There are
two opinions in this regard, the first o f which is more authentic. Some
o f the Pious Predecessors said: All the speech o f the son o f Adam is held
against him and not for him except the remembrance o f Allah and
anything allied to it.
Abu Bakr As-Siddiq -Allah be pleased with him - would hold his tongue
and say: “This has led me to ruin.”
Your speech is your captive, when it exits your mouth you become its
captive, and Allah says about the tongue o f anyone who utters a word:

1 C ollected by Im am A hm ad 4/123 [17114].

“He does not utter any word except that w ith him is an observer
prepared to record.” [Qaf:18]
The tongue also carries two severe ills, if people rid themselves from one,
they cannot rid themselves o f the other. Each one could possibly be
worse than the other at a particular time. As the one who is silent about
the truth is a devil w ithout a tongue, disobedient to Allah, two-faced
and deceptive if he does not fear for his ow n safety, whereas the one
who speaks with falsehood is a devil that speaks. Most o f creation is
devious in their speech and in their silence; thus, they alternate between
the tw o aforementioned types.
As for the people along the middle course -th ey are those upon the
straight path- they withheld their tongues from pronouncing any
falsehood and used their tongues in that which earns them benefit in the
Hereafter. None o f them deem it suitable to utter a word wastefully
w ithout any benefit let alone something that will be o f harm in the
Hereafter. Indeed, an individual will be presented on the Day of
Resurrection with good deeds like mountains, yet he will find that his
tongue has demolished it all, whilst others will have bad deeds as high as
the mountains, yet he will find that his tongue has wiped them all away
through the abundance o f the remembrance o f Allah and anything
related to it.

The Steps
Safeguarding them occurs by way o f not taking any footsteps towards
anything unrewarding. If there is no increase in reward tied to the
footsteps, then remaining stationary and seated is better. O ne is also able
to derive a good deed from every permissible action he traverses towards
and sincerely devotes to Allah, consequently making his footsteps a
means o f nearness and devotion.
However, when the mistake could potentially be two through the
mistake from the feet and the mistake from the tongue, the tw o became
closely associated with each other in the statement o f Allah:

thoughts in His statement:

“He know s the traitorous glance and w hat the breasts conceal.”

The Harms o f Fornication and Adultery
This has all been mentioned prior to this in the chapters regarding the
forbiddance o f immoral acts and the obligation o f safeguarding chastity.
The Prophet said: “The thing(s) that mostly casts the people into the
Hellfire are the m outh and the private parts.”'
Also, in the Sahih o f al-BukharT and the Saliih o f Muslim, the Prophet
said: “It is not permissible to establish capital punishment o f a Muslim
except in three instances [under Muslim law]: the married person who
commits adultery, a life for a life, and the one who forsakes his religion
and separates from the main body .”2 This narration that associates
fornication, disbelief and murder is counterpart to the aforementioned
verse in the chapter o f al-Furqan and the previously mentioned
narration on the authority o f Ibn Mas ud. The Prophet began in
sequence o f the most frequently performed action and then the one that
follows. Fornication occurs more frequently than murder, and murder
occurs more often than apostasy. It is also a gradual mention from a
major sin to that which is more major.
The harms o f adultery and fornication cause a reversal in uprightness o f
humanity. If the woman commits adultery, she causes shame on her
family, husband, and relatives and causes them embarrassment amongst
the people. If she becomes pregnant from the fornication and aborts or
kills her child, she would have combined the acts o f ending a life and

fornication. If she places the burden on her husband, she would have
introduced someone to them who is foreign and unrelated to them, they
would be exposed to this child and he will be secluded with them and
ascribed to them when he is not even from their [the husband’s] lineage
along with other consequences related to this. As for the adultery
performed by a man, it also mixes the lineages, ruins the chaste woman
and exposes her to corruption and immorality. This major sin contains
the potential for ruin in this life and the Hereafter. How many things as
a consequence o f fornication are deemed as lawful, how many rights are
lost and how much oppression befalls!
From the distinctive traits o f this act: It introduces poverty, shortens
lifespan, and drapes the perpetrator with blackness on the face and a
garment o f resentment amongst the people.
Also, from its distinctively detrimental effects: It scatters the heart’s
emotions and causes it illness if not death. It also ignites the feelings of
worry, sorrow and fear and distances one from the Angel whilst drawing
them closer to Satan.
There is no consequence more evil than that o f murder after the
consequences for this act. Thus, capital punishment has been legislated
in the most severe measures. If an individual was informed that their
wife or near female relative had been murdered, it would be easier for
him to deal with than if he was informed that she had fornicated.
Sa d bin ‘Ubadah said: “If I saw a man with my wife, I would strike him
with the sharp end o f my sword.” This statement reached the Messenger
o f Allah^ to which he said: “Do you w onder at Sa d’s sense o f honor?
Verily, I have more sense o f honor than Sad, and Allah has more honor

364

The Disease A n d The Cure

than I. And due to this sense o f honor, Allah has forbidden all immoral
acts, apparent and concealed .”1
Also, in the Sahih o f al-Bukhari and the Sahih o f Muslim on the authority
o f the Prophet who said: “Indeed, Allah has honor, surely the believer
has honor and the honor o f Allah is violated if the servant commits what
He has forbidden him from .”2
In the Sahih o f al-Bukhari and the Sahih o f Muslim on the authority o f
the Prophet: “None has more sense o f honor than Allah, and for this He
has forbidden shameful sins whether committed openly or secretly, none
loves a valid excuse from His servants more than Allah, thus He sent
Messengers as bearers o f good news and warders. None loves to be
praised more than Allah does, and so He Praises Himself.”3
Also, in the Sahih o f al-Bukhari and the Saluh o f M uslim 4: The
Messenger o f Allah^ said during the sermon after the eclipse prayer:
“Nation o f M uhammad^! By Allah, there is no one more jealous than
Allah should a male or female slave o f His com mit adultery. Nation o f
Muhammad^! If you know what I know, you would laugh a little and
cry a lot.” Then he raised his hands and said, “Allah, have I conveyed?”
In m entioning this major sin in particular after the eclipse prayer there
is a marvelous secret that can be unraveled for those who ponder. The

prevalence o f fornication and adultery is from the signs o f world
destruction, and it is from the signs o f the Final H our as has been
reported by Anas in the Sahih o f al-BukharT and the Sahih o f Muslim
wherein he said: “1 will narrate something to you I heard from Allah's
Messenger and none other than I will tell you o f it. 1 heard Allah's
Messenger say, “From among the signs o f the H our is religious
knowledge will be removed, ignorance will increase; drinking alcoholic
will prevail, illegal sexual intercourse will be obvious, men will decrease
in number, and women will increase in number, so much so that fifty
women will be under the guardianship o f one man .”1
The way of Allah, The Most Sublime, throughout time as it relates to
His creation is that in the event o f a prevalence o f fornication, Allah
becomes angry and His anger intensifies. Thus, it is inevitable that the
result o f His anger manifests itself on the earth in the form o f a
punishment. Abdullah bin Mas ud said: “Usury and fornication never
become prevalent in a township except that Allah grants permission for
it to be destroyed.” O ne o f the Jewish Rabbis witnessed one o f his
children harass a woman, so he said: “Be cautious my son, be cautious
my son.” Consequently, he fell from his bed, broke his spine and his wife
had a miscarriage. It was then said to him: “Is that how you become
angry for My sake? You shall never receive a Rabbi from your loins
(offspring).”
Allah specified the reprimand for fornication in three aspects amongst
all other reprimands. First: capital punishment in the worst possible way.
However, in the case o f the lesser form, it is a combination between a

366

The Disease A n d The Cure

punishment exerted on the body through lashes and a punishment on
the heart in being banished from the homeland for one year.
Second: Allah has prohibited His servants from having pity for the
perpetrators in the religion o f Allah in a manner that will prevent them
from exerting the reprimand because it is from His Compassion and
Mercy that He has ordained such reprimands. He is more Merciful than
you, yet His mercy does not prevent Him from ordaining this penalty
so the compassion you hold in your hearts should not prevent you from
executing His commands. Such feelings may apply to each and every
penalty; however, it was particularly mentioned in relation to the
reprimand o f fornication and adultery due to the dire need for it. The
people do not find the same sense o f harshness and sternness towards the
fornicator as they would feel towards the thief, the one who maligns the
honor o f someone else or the one who consumes alcohol. Their hearts
express mercy towards the fornicator more than it would towards any
other perpetrator o f a crime, and reality testifies to this. Therefore, they
have been prohibited from expressing this form o f compassion that may
lead them to cease the legislated penalties.
The reason for this mercy is that this particular sin occurs from the
nobles, the middle-class and the lower classes. The souls have a motive
for it, there are many participating in it and most o f the reasons for it are
a result o f infatuation, whilst the hearts are fashioned into having mercy
for the one trialed with infatuation and many consider helping the one
infatuated as an act o f obedience and worship, even if the object they
are infatuated by is unlawful for them. O ne should not disregard this
reality as it is firmly rooted w ithin those w hom Allah wills. W e have
been told o f many stories in this regard.
Additionally, this is a type o f sin that mainly takes place after the consent
o f both parties, not through transgression, oppression, forcefulness or
otherwise from the things that shock people. It also consists o f an
367

The Disease A n d The Cure

overwhelming urge, and so such feelings can be envisaged by others,
and consequently there may arise a sense o f mercy that obstructs the
establishment o f the penalty.
However, all this is due to a weakness in faith. Excellence in faith is in
finding the strength to implement the command o f Allah and finding
the mercy w ithin oneself towards the one being penalized, in which case
a person yields to the command and mercy o f his Lord.
Third: Allah has commanded that their reprimand be before the eyes o f
the believers, not in seclusion out o f view from others. That is more
comprehensive in achieving the desired benefit from the reprimand and
it is part o f the wisdom behind the deterrent. The reprimand for the
adulterer is derived from the punishment that Allah delivered to the
people o f Lot who were pelted with stones. That is due to the shared
common ground between fornication and sodomy in their immorality,
each o f which contain an evil that contradicts the objective and wisdom
o f Allah amongst His creation and His commands.
After careful scrutiny, it should be said: if the one who has been trialed
with this catastrophe repents and is granted a sincere repentance and the
opportunity to perform righteous actions, becomes a more righteous
person in his latter years than he was in his earlier years, exchanges his
misdeeds for good ones, cleanses the disgrace with various forms o f
obedience, diverts his gaze from anything unlawful, safeguards his
chastity from anything illegitimate and is truthful with Allah in his
dealings with Him, such an individual shall be forgiven and is from those
to enter Paradise. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins, and since a sincere
repentance eradicates every sin, even polytheism, the murder o f
Prophets and other righteous allies o f Allah, sorcery, disbelief and
otherwise, it does not fail to eradicate such a misdeed.
It has been firmly established as a result o f the perfect Wisdom, Justice,
and Virtue o f Allah that the repentant one is like someone who does not
368

The Disease A n d The Cure

have any sin. Allah has further guaranteed to exchange the sins o f the
polytheist, the murderer and the fornicator into good deeds upon
repentance. Allah has said:

j j i i l f y* jAji
“Say, ‘My servants w ho have transgressed against them selves, do
not despair o f the mercy o f Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins.
Indeed, it is He al-Ghafur Ar-RahTm." [Az-Zumar:53]
Hence, not even one sin is excluding from this generality, however it is
something specifically afforded to the repentant ones.

Many Are Denied a Good End in Their Final
M oments
If you notice the condition o f many o f those who are approaching their
final moments in this life, you find that they are obstructed from a good
end as a punishment for them in recompense for their evil deeds, alHafiz Abu Muhammad Abdul-Haq bin Abdur-Rahman al-Ishbili said:
“Know that a terrible end -Allah grant us refuge from it- has reasons,
paths and gates that lead to it. The most significant o f which is a
devotion to the worldly life and a diversion from the Hereafter along
with a boldness and audacity to disobey Allah. It could be that a
particular mistake, or a type o f sin has overwhelmed an individual, or a
portion o f deviation or some audacity and boldness to sin that seizes their
heart captures their mind, extinguishes its light and drapes it with the
veil. In which case, a reminder is o f no benefit nor does an admonition
take effect on them. Thus, it is possible that death approaches such an
individual whilst they are in this state and they hear the call from a
distance, but they are unaware o f the intent and do not know what has
been intended even if the caller echoes the call and repeats.”
He said: It has been reported that a man from the soldiers o f An-Nasir
approached death, so his son said to him: “Say La llaha Ilia Allah.” He
replied: “An-Nasir is my master.” His son repeated the request, but his
father said the same thing. He then fainted and when he regained
consciousness he said: “An-Nasir is my master.” This is how he
continued, every time he was requested to say “La llaha Ilia Allah,” he
replied: “An-Nasir is my master.” Then he said to his son: “So and so,
An-Nasir knows you by your sword, murder, m urder.” He then died.

371

The Disease A n d The Cure

Abdul-Haq also said: It was said to someone else whom I know: “Say La
Ilaha Ilia Allah,” so he replied: “M end such and such in that particular
building, do such and such in that garden.”
He also said: Abu At-Tahir as-Silafi permitted me to convey a story o f a
man who approached his death and it was said to him: “Say La Ilaha Ilia
Allah,” but instead he said in Persian: “Da Yazada,” which means: “Ten,
eleven.”
It was also said to someone else: “Say La Ilaha Ilia Allah,” but he replied:
“How do I get to Hamani M injab?”
There is a story behind the above statement, it is one o f a man who was
standing adjacent to his home and the shape o f his door resembled the
door o f al-H am am , when a woman who had a beautiful appearance
passed by him and asked him: “W hat is the way to Hamani M injab?” He
then chose to mislead her in his home and said: “This is the way to
Hamani M injab,” before she entered the house and he followed her in.
W hen she found herself inside his house and she realized that he tricked
her, she openly displayed happiness and joy in their com ing together,
but she said that it would be much more befitting if we had some
pleasantries with us and something that delights the eye. He then said to
her: “I will bring you whatever you want and desire right now .” So he
left in pursuit o f these things and left her in the house w ithout locking
it. He obtained what he needed and returned to find that she left w ithout
taking a single item with her. At which point, the man began to worry
a lot and frequently mentioned her, and he began to walk along the
streets and alleyways saying:
O ’ the one mho once said whilst she mas exhausted — what is the way to
Hamani Minjab

As he was repeating these words o f distress one day, a woman responded
to him from a window:

372

The Disease A n d The Cure

I f only you had been able to gain her — through securing the home or
locking the door

Nonetheless, his passion increased and the stimulation w ithin him raged
violently, and he continued in this manner until his final words in this
life were from the above lines o f poetry.
He also said: It has been reported that a man became infatuated with
someone (by the name o f Aslam) and found it difficult whilst the love
for this person had taken over the heart, and he became bedridden as a
result. However, this individual whom he was infatuated with was
prevented from meeting with him and became distant. Nonetheless,
intermediaries tried to unite the pair until the other individual agreed to
see him. The despondent one was informed o f this promise and became
elated, his joy intensified, he was relieved o f his anxiety and he began to
wait patiently for the meeting. At which point, the intermediary
approached to convey a message and said, “He followed me for most o f
the journey to you before retreating, so I w ent back to speak to him ,”
but he said: “He mentioned me and became troubled due to my absence,
and I do not wish to be involved in dubious activity and I do not wish
to place myself in suspicious predicaments.” So I repeated the request
but he refused and departed. W hen the despondent one heard this
account, he dropped the contents in his hand and returned to a more
severe condition than he was in, and the signs o f death became visible
on him, so he said:
O ’ Aslam , the relief to m y illness — and the remedy for the meager
Your pleasure is more beloved to m y heart — than the Mercy of the exalted
Creator

I said to him: “So and so, fear Allah.” He replied: “Previously.” So I left
his presence and I did not even pass the door to exit before hearing the

373

The Disease A m i The Cure

commotion o f his death. W e seek refuge in Allah from a terrible and evil
end to our lives.
O n a particular night, Sufyan at-Thaw r! wept until the morning. W hen
the morning came, he was asked: “All this in fear o f sins?” So he grabbed
a handful o f straw from the ground and said: “Sins are insignificant in
comparison to this, rather, 1 weep from a fear o f a bad end.”
Undoubtedly, this is from the greatest display o f a good understanding
for a man to fear that his misdeeds will expose him at the moment o f
death, consequently denying him a good end to life.
Al-Imam Ahmad narrates on the authority o f Abu Ad-Darda that when
he approached his death in the final moments o f his life, he experienced
momentary loss o f consciousness, and when he would regain
consciousness he would recite:

“And W e w ill turn away their hearts and their eyes just as they
refused to believe in it the first tim e, and W e w ill leave them in
their transgression w andering blindly.” [al-An am:110]
Due to this, the Pious Predecessors feared that sins would intervene
between them and a good end.
He further stated: “Know that a terrible end -m ay Allah grant us refuge
from it- does not befall someone who is openly steadfast and internally
righteous. That is unheard of, and all praise is due to Allah. It befalls
those who have a corruption o f creed, or persistence upon major sins or
a liking to grave acts. All o f which could possibly overcome him until
he is struck by death before making repentance, seizing him before
rectifying his inner-self and ceasing his existence in this life before
returning to Allah, allowing Satan to take advantage in that situation

374

The Disease A n d The Cure

and snatching him during that mom ent o f confusion. Refuge is sought
from Allah.”
He also said: “It has been narrated that there was a man who once lived
in Egypt who would constantly be present in the mosque to deliver the
call to prayer and perform the daily prayers. There was a brightness o f
obedience and a light o f worship that was visible on his face. O ne day,
he climbed the minaret as usual to perform the call to prayer, and situated
beneath this minaret was the house o f a Christian family, so he looked
inside from above and saw the daughter o f the homeowner. He became
enchanted by her and left the call to prayer to go and see her and entered
her home. She said to him: ‘W hat is the matter with you? W hat do you
want? He replied: “I want you,” and she then said: ‘W hat do you want
me for?’ He said: ‘You have captured my mind and w on over my heart.’
she replied: ‘I will never comply to you in a dubious manner.’ So the
man said: ‘In that case, marry me,’ however she replied: ‘You are a
Muslim and I am a Christian, and my father will never marry me off to
you,’ so he complied and said: ‘So I will become a Christian,’ to which
she replied: ‘If you do so, I will comply.’ Thereafter, the man became a
Christian so he could marry her, and he stayed in their home thereafter.
O n the same day, he climbed to the roof o f the house for something and
fell off it and died. In the end, he did not gain the woman and he lost his
religion.”

“My people! These are my daughters [w om enfolk o f the city], they

However, Prophet Lut sensed that the appointed time for their
destruction was slow coming and said that he wanted it to be sooner, so
the Angels responded to him by asking the rhetorical question:

“Is not the m orning near.” [Hud:8l]
By Allah, the only time that separated between the demise o f the
enemies o f Allah and the salvation o f His Prophet and righteous allies
was the time between the early m orning dawn and daybreak before their
entire land was uprooted from its foundations, raised to the sky until the

He powerfully seized them whilst they were asleep, and it approached

Aspirations in this life that were deemed nice — hut after death they became

The pleasures have vanished and been followed by sorrow. The urge has
ended and resulted in distress. They enjoyed themselves for a short while
and are punished for a long time. They indulged in luxuries and it
resulted in a painful torment. They became drunk with the intoxication
o f that desire and did not regain consciousness from it until they were
in the abode o f the tormented. They were tranquilized by the
heedlessness and didn’t wake up until they were in the abode o f the
doomed ones. They regret it all -b y Allah- to the furthest degree at a

The Remedy to a passionate Infatuation is
T hrough tw o Means
If it is asked: After all o f this, is there any remedy to this fatal illness, and
is there an exorcism to this lethal spell? W hat does one resort to in
repelling this poison? Is there any path to success and guidance and can
the drunken one from the intoxication o f desire regain consciousness?
Can the infatuated one re-ow n his heart after the passion has reached its
depths? Is the doctor able to employ a method for the cure from this
terrible disease?
If this individual is blamed, he finds pleasure in it because the one he
loves is mentioned and ifhe is rebuked, he is stirred by it and continues
in the path towards his aim. His condition cries out and his tongue says:
M y desires reached as far as you were — I will not go further or stop before
You belittled me, so I endeavored to belittle myself — the one who is
belittled to you cannot be noble
Y ou n o w resem ble an en e m y, so I began to love th e m — i f I g a in fro m them
w h a t I g a in fro m y o u

I find that being blamed because of you is pleasant — because you are
mentioned, so let the blamers blame me

Perhaps this was the objective behind the initial question and the
illness that the cure is sought for.

38 3

The Disease A n d The Cure

W e declare: Yes, the general answer can be found in the M usnad o f
Imam Ahmad 1 on the authority o f Usamah bin Shurayk who narrated
that the Prophet said: “Indeed, Allah never decreed an illness, except that
He also decreed its cure. Those who know it, know so, and those who
are ignorant o f it, are ignorant o f it.”
The approach towards the remedy for this illness is from two angles:
One: Term inating it before it occurs
Second: Removing it after it occurs
Both are easy for the person whom Allah has ordained it easy for, and
impossible for the one whom Allah does not aid, as all affairs are in His
Hands.
As far as the preventative measure from being afflicted by this illness,
they are through two means:
One: Diverting the gaze, as previously mentioned. Indeed, the glance is
a poisoned arrow from the arrows o f Iblis (Satan). So whoever unleashes
their sight shall experience prolonged sorrow. Diverting the gaze
contains numerous benefits and it is a part o f this beneficial remedy.
O ne benefit is: It is compliance to the commands o f Allah, which is the
pinnacle o f a servant’s joy in his worldly life and the afterlife. There is
nothing more beneficial for an individual in this life or the Hereafter
than complying with the commands o f Allah The Most High. None
have found true happiness unless they adhere to His commands, and
none have ever found despair in this life and the Hereafter except by
way o f violating His commands.

1 4/278 [18456]

384

The Disease A n d The Cure

Second benefit: It prevents the effect o f the poisoned arrow that may
contain his destruction from ever reaching his heart.
Third benefit: It provides the heart a connection with Allah and a focus
towards Him. Undoubtedly, unleashing the sight scatters, divides and
distances the heart from Allah. Moreover, there is nothing more harmful
than unleashing the eyesight as it causes separation between the servant
and his Lord.
Fourth benefit: It strengthens the heart and gives it happiness, just as
unleashing the sight weakens the heart and saddens it.
Fifth benefit: It earns a light w ithin the heart just as unleashing it earns
it darkness. This is why Allah has mentioned the ‘verse o f light’ in
succession to the matter o f diverting the gaze, He said:

“Say to the believers, ‘divert your sight and safeguard your private
parts.” [An-Nur:30]
After the aforementioned verse, He said:

“Allah is the light o f the heavens and the earth, the similitude o f
His light is like a niche and w ith in it a lam p,” [An-Nur:35] i.e., the
similitude o f His light in the heart o f His believing servant that has
complied with His commands and avoided His prohibitions. If the heart
has been illuminated, good will proceed from every side, just as if the
heart is darkened, the clouds o f calamity and evil loom from every place
from the various innovations and misguidances, an adherence to false
desires, avoidance o f guidance, refusing the means to bliss or occupying
oneself with the reason o f wretchedness! The light that is within the

385

The Disease A n d The Cure

heart can remove all this. However, if this light is missing, the individual
continues as a blind person who wanders amongst the pitch-black
darkness.
Sixth benefit: It produces a truthful discernment that is used to
distinguish between the right and the w rong and the truthful and the
fraudulent. Shuja’ al-Kirmani used to say: “W hoever fills their outwardly
state with the adherence to the Sunnah and his inner-self with constant
piety, diverts his gaze from the unlawful sights, withholds himself from
false desires and nourishes himself with lawful means, his discernment
shall not fail him.” Shuja’ was someone whose discernment did not fail
him.
Allah The Exalted recompenses His servant for his action from what the
person earns for himself, and whoever abandons something for the sake
o f Allah shall be recompensed by Allah with something better than it.
Thus, if someone diverts their sight from the unlawful matters, Allah
shall recompense him by casting the light o f insight within him for
imprisoning his sight for the sake o f Allah and opens the gate o f
knowledge, faith, truthful and accurate discernment that is only attained
through the insight o f the heart. The opposite o f this is the state o f the
sodomites that Allah has described whereby their blindness prevented
them from gaining insight. Allah said:
0O

p

-

S

-

d

'A’JJxS

“Indeed, they were in their intoxication w andering blindly.” [al—
Hijr:72]
He described them as intoxicated, which is the definition o f a spoiled
mind, and the blindness that is the spoiling o f insight.
Hence, an infatuation with images spoils the mind, causes a blindness o f
insight and an intoxication o f the heart, as the poet has said:
386

The Disease A n d The Cure

D runk with an intoxication of desires and an intoxication o f addiction —
when is the awakening for the one who is drunk?

Another said:
They say I have turned mad from the one I desire, so I said to them —
Passionate obsession is more than what the mad people have (the difference
is) O ne cannot regain consciousness from passionate obsession — whereas the
mad one may be affected for only a moment

Seventh benefit: It provides the heart with resolve, courage and strength.
Thus, Allah combines a dom inating ability and strength, as has been
reported in the narration: “The one who disregards his desires, the devil
flees from his shadow.” Contrary to this, you will find that the one who
obeys their desires will carry humiliation, lowliness, insignificance,
vileness and worthlessness in their soul that Allah gives the one who
disobeys Him, as al-Hasan said: “Even if they are obeyed by their mules,
and the they ride their horses swiftly, the humiliation o f sin never leaves
them. Allah chooses to humiliate anyone w ho disobeys H im .”
Allah has declared honor to be closely connected with His obedience,
and humiliation is connected to His disobedience. He said:
-ITT?

° y ^ iA j

“To Allah belongs all honor, and to His M essenger and to the
believers.” [al-Munafiqun:8]
and He said:

“So do not w eaken and do n ot grieve, and you w ill be superior if
you are believers.” [Aal- Imran:139].

387

The Disease A n d The Cure

Faith (Iman) is statement and action, both inward and outward. Allah
also said:

“W hoever desires honor, then to Allah belongs all honor, to H im
ascends good speech and righteous w ork He raises it.” [Fatir:10]
W hoever seeks honor should request it through the obedience o f Allah,
His remembrance, good speech and righteous work.
As occurs in the supplication o f al-Q im iit : “He is not humiliated whom
You have allied, and he is not honored whom You have opposed .”1
W hoever obeys Allah shall be allied with Him in whatever he obeys
Him in and shall gain honor in accordance to his obedience. W hoever
disobeys Him shall receive enmity in whatever he has disobeyed Him in
and shall be humiliated in accordance.
Eighth benefit: It blocks Satan’s entrance into the heart as he enters
through the glance and surges in quicker than a gust o f wind in an
empty space. He begins by beautifying the image being viewed,
adorning it and making it an idol that the heart devotes itself to. Then
he promises him and stirs him and stimulates the heart with the burning
flame o f desire before presenting the fuel for the fire that is the sins that
one cannot achieve except by way of this image, thus the heart becomes
enflamed. From these flames are the exhalations o f fire and effects o f
burns. Indeed, the heart has been enveloped with a flame from every
angle, so it is like a sheep in the middle o f a furnace. This is why the
punishment o f the people who have been infatuated by unlawful images
1 C o lle c te d b y A bu D a w u d [142 5 ,1 4 2 6 ], Ibn M ajah [l 178], A t-T irm id h T [464], a l-Im a m
A h m ad 1/199,200 [1 718,1721],

388

The Disease A n d The Cure

is a burning fire in their graves that their souls shall feel until the
Resurrection, as the narration that has been collected by al-BukharT and
Muslim that highlighted the Prophet’s dream clearly portrayed.
N inth benefit: It clears the heart so that it can think about its benefits
and preoccupy itself with them. Unleashing the sight scatters this
thought process and intervenes between it, so he neglects this cause and
falls into desires and a heedlessness from the remembrance o f His Lord.
Allah said:

“ ...a n d do not obey one w hose heart W e have made heedless o f
Our remembrance and w ho follow s his desires and his affair is ever
in n eglect.” [al-Kahf:28]
Indeed, unleashing the sight induces these three affairs in due measure.
Tenth benefit: Between the eyes and the heart is an opening and a
passage that affects the other, each can either rectify or corrupt the other.
Hence, if the heart becomes corrupt, so does the sight, and if the sight
becomes corrupt, so does the heart. The same applies with regards to
rectification. If the eye becomes corrupt, the heart also becomes corrupt
and ruined and turns into a container for rubbish and a place to unload
any impurities, obscenity or dirt. At that point, it becomes unbefitting
to contain the knowledge o f Allah, a love for Him, devotion to Him,
closeness to Him and a joy at gaining a nearness to Him. Rather, the
opposite can only reside w ithin such a heart.
This is a reference to some o f the benefits o f diverting the gaze from
unlawful things and can provide some insight into the reasons for some
o f the illnesses.

389

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Second Approach Towards the Remedy
Preoccupying the heart with a repellent or something that will intervene
between the individual and the sin. This is attained either through an
apprehensive fear or a stirring love. W henever the heart does not have
the fear o f losing out on something that if obtained is more harmful than
attaining the thing they love or a fear o f attaining something that would
be more harmful than missing out on their beloved object, or a love for
something that is more beneficial to him than this beloved object whilst
losing out on, then it is more harmful than losing out on this beloved
object. If the state is like this, the individual will inevitably have a
passionate infatuation for images.
Explaining the above is as follows. The soul shall not leave something it
loves unless it is for something it loves more, or due to a fear o f being
afflicted with something that brings more harm than the passing o f this
beloved object. In this case, the individual is in need o f two things, if
both or one o f them is missing, they shall not be o f benefit to themselves.
One o f these things is precise insight that he can use in distinguishing
the difference between something loved and something detested, so that
he may value the most beloved over the other and bear the lesser harm
to avoid the greater harm. Undoubtedly, this is the role o f the mind, and
nobody can be considered intellectual if they act in contradiction to this;
in fact, animals may be better positioned than such a person.
The second thing is the strength in resolve and patience one can use to
remain firm in either partaking in something or abandoning it. Many a
time do people recognize the gulf in difference between particular
actions, yet they refuse the correct option due to a weakness in the soul

391

The Disease A n d The Cure

or a weakness in determination or conviction to put forth the best choice
due to greed, covetousness and depravity o f his soul and ambitions. Such
a person cannot be o f benefit to their selves, nor can anyone else benefit
from it.
Allah has denied leadership in the religion to anyone unless they posses
the two qualities o f patience and certitude, He said:

“And W e made from am ong them leaders guiding by Our
com m and w h en they were patient and they were certain o f our
signs. ” [As-Sajda:24]
This is the individual w ho benefits from their knowledge and the
people too gain benefit from it. However, someone w ho is opposite to
this shall not benefit from their knowledge and neither will others
benefit from it. There are some who are a benefit to their own selves but
not to others. The difference is that the first type o f person treads a path
in his own light and the people walk alongside him in this light, and the
second type is walking in darkness and those who follow him also walk
in this darkness. As for the third type [who only benefits himself], he
walks in his light alone.

392

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Heart Can Never Com bine a Love for
Allah, The Most H igh, and a Passion for Images
and Lewd Desires
O nce you have absorbed this prelude, then you should also know that
the heart will not combine the love for O ne W ho is loved above all [in
worship] and an infatuation for images. These are two opposites that do
not meet, and one must leave. Thus, w hoever’s strength o f love is
devoted to The O ne W ho is loved above all, and any love to anyone
else is deemed false and a torm ent for the individual, this love to Him
diverts an individual from loving someone else. If an individual does
happen to love other than Him, it is only a love for the sake o f Allah, or
a means to it or something that cuts off from whatever opposes or
nullifies his love.
Truthful love necessitates singling Allah in love w ithout associating
anyone else with Him in love. If the one being loved was from amongst
the creation, he would become haughty and jealous if the love that is
being devoted to him is shared with someone else, and he would detest
the one w ho does this, distance him, not allow him to be near him and
consider him dishonest in his love even though he is not able to divert
his love towards himself. So how would it be in the case o f O ne W ho
should be loved above all and whose love should not be diverted to
anyone but Him, whilst any love to anyone else is a torm ent and harm
to the person? This is why Allah does not forgive the one who associates
partners with Him in the worship o f love and forgives anything else that
is lesser than that.

393

The Disease A n d The Cure

An infatuation for images causes the servant to lose out on what is more
beneficial for them. Moreover, it causes a person to lose out on the love
o f the O ne W hom there cannot be any good, blessings or beneficial life
without. Choose one o f the two, because they cannot be combined
together in the heart, nor can they be removed from it together. In fact,
the one who recoils from the love o f Allah, His remembrance, and a
yearning to meet Him will be trialed with the love o f something else,
and it will be a source o f torm ent for that individual in the worldly life,
the grave and after the Resurrection. Either he is torm ented with the
love for shrines, or the cross, or an infatuation to fire worship, or a love
o f young beardless men, or an infatuation to women, or money, or the
love o f companions and associates or the love o f something at a lesser
degree that is o f utmost worthlessness and insignificance. So a person is
a slave to his beloved, whatever it may be! As the poet said:
Yon are the victim of anything you love — So choose lor yourself whoever
you want

Therefore, whoever does not take his sovereign ruler and ultimate
master as the only true deity to worship, the thing he ends up
worshipping will be his own desires. Allah said:

“Have you seen the one w ho has taken as his god his ow n desire,
and Allah has thus sent him astray upon know ledge and has placed

W h o w ill guide him after Allah? W ill you not then be reminded?”
[al-Jathiyah:23]

394

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Levels o f Love
The distinctive bearings o f worship are to express love alongside
submission and degradation to the one being loved. W hoever loves
something and submits to it has consequently devoted his heart in
worship to it. In fact, devotion in worship is the final and highest level
o f love and is also know n as ta ta y y u m . However, the first is the level o f
‘a la q a h (connection), and it has been named as such due to the ‘alaqah
(connection) the heart has with the beloved.
After this level is the one o f a l-sa b a b a (devotion), and it was named as
such due the outpouring o f devotion the heart affords the beloved. A
poet once said:
Those in love have complained of al-sababa (devotion), I wish — I bore their
pain all alone
So m y heart could feel all the pleasure of love — that nobody else before me
or after me would feel

This is followed by al-pharam (adherent), which is the unyielding love
expressed by the heart that becomes inseparable from it. This is also why
a penalty charge is called ^/w im due to its inseparability from the person.
Also, the statement o f Allah:

“Indeed, its punishm ent is ever adhering [ g h a r a m a [alFurqan:65]
Many o f the later scholars have used this term in association with love,
so the early poets have seldom used it. This level is followed by al-'ishq

(passionate infatuation), which is a wild form o f love. Thus, the Lord must

never be described as possessing this form o f love and the term must
never be used pertaining to His Majesty.
Then there is a l- s h a w q (a longing), and it is defined as the eager journey
o f the heart to the beloved one, and has been used as it relates to The
Lord as is the case in the M usnad o f al-Imam A hm ad 1 on the authority
o f ‘Amar bin Yasir who led us in a prayer yet made it concise, so when
he was asked about it, he said: “Nonetheless, I still invoked Allah with
an invocation that the Prophet would say: ‘O Allah, by Your Knowledge
o f the unseen and Your Power over the creation, keep me alive so long
as You know that living is good for me and cause me to die when You
know that death is better for me. O Allah, cause me to fear You in secret
and in public. I ask You to make me true in speech in times o f pleasure
and o f anger. I ask You to make me moderate in times o f wealth and
poverty. And I ask You for everlasting delight and joy that will never
cease. I ask You to make me pleased with that which You have decreed
and for an easy life after death. I ask You for the sweetness o f looking
upon Your face and a longing to meet You in a manner that does not
entail a calamity that will bring about harm or a trial that will cause
deviation. O Allah, beautify us with the adornment o f faith and make us
am ong those who guide and are rightly guided.’”
It has also been reported in another narration: “The longing o f my
righteous servant to see Me has been a long one, and I want to see them
even m ore.” This corresponds in meaning to the statement o f the
Prophet wherein he says: “W hoever loves to see Allah, Allah loves to see
him .”2

“W hoever hopes for the m eetin g w ith Allah, indeed, the term
decreed by Allah is co m in g .” [al-‘Ankabut:5]
Since Allah knows the intensity o f the longing to see Him w ithin the
hearts o f His righteous allies and that their hearts will not be content
unless they meet Him, He declared that there would be an appointed
time for His meeting so their souls can find rest.
The most pleasant and delightful life o f all is the life o f those who love
Allah, are at ease with Him and long to meet Him. Their life is the truly
pleasant one in reality and there is no other life that is more pleasant,
blessed or satisfying than theirs. It is the pleasant life that is mentioned
in the statement o f Allah:

“W hoever does good deeds, w hether male or female and is a
believer, W e shall grant them a pleasant life.” [An-Nahl:97]
The intended meaning here is not the life that is common between the
believers and the unbelievers or between the righteous and the immoral
from the various forms o f food, clothing, drinks and marriages, the type
o f life in which the enemies o f Allah may possess many times as much
as the pious allies o f Allah. Additionally, Allah has guaranteed that He
will grant anyone w ho performs righteous deeds with a pleasant life. He

is the most truthful in His promise W ho never fails on His promise.
W hich life is better than the life o f a person whose worries have all
united and become one concern directed towards attaining the pleasure
o f Allah, gathered the scattered feelings o f his heart through the devotion
to Allah, whose intentions and thoughts that were once divided- each
scattered in a different valley- are now focused on Allah. So the
remembrance o f the Most Beloved, the love to Him and the longing to
meet Him and the comfort in being near to him becomes overwhelming
over him. His concern, intentions and objectives and the feelings o f his
heart revolve around all this, if he remains quiet, he does so for Allah’s
sake, and if he speaks, he speaks for the sake o f Allah, if he hears, it is
through the guidance o f Allah, if he sees, it is through the guidance o f
Allah. Through this guidance he grasps, he walks, he moves and he
remains still. Through it he lives, he dies and he is resurrected as has been
collected in the Saluh of al-BukharT on the authority o f the Prophet who
conveys from his Lord that He said: “And the most beloved thing with
which My slave comes nearer to Me is what I have enjoined upon him;
and My slave continues to comes closer to Me through performing
supererogatory acts till 1 love him. W hen I love him, I become his
hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand
with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks, and if he asks
(something) from Me, 1 give him, and if he seeks My Protection
(refuge), I protect him. I have never withheld [in a manner that befits
His Majesty] from anything I do as much as I withhold [in a manner
that befits His Majesty] from taking the soul o f My believing servant, he
dislikes death and 1 dislike to upset him, nonetheless, it is an inevitable

The Disease A n d The Cure

This noble and divine narration is one that those o f stubborn character
and a blind heart denied themselves from understanding and know ing
the intent behind. He has compiled the reasons for attaining His love in
two affairs: Implementing the obligations and drawing closer to Him
through supererogatory acts o f worship.
Allah has informed that performing the obligatory acts o f worship are
the most beloved means that any o f those who are near to Him can use
as a means o f drawing closer, followed by the supererogatory acts. Also,
the one who expresses this love continues to increase in performing the
supererogatory acts until he becomes beloved to Allah. If he reaches a
point wherein he is beloved to Allah, this love from Allah grants the
individual an extra found love for Allah that exceeds the initial love.
Hence, this love occupies his heart for any ideas or worries from
diverting him from his main love, it captures the soul and does not leave
any room for any other beloved one. Thus, his most beloved one
becomes the reigning figure over his heart and is overpowering his soul.
There is no doubt that if this individual hears, he does so with his
beloved one, ifhe sees, he sees with him, ifhe grasps, he grasps with him
and ifhe walks, he walks with him. The thought o f him is constantly in
his heart, he accompanies him, finds comfort in being with him and
befriends him (with guidance and protection). The letter ‘ba’ that is used
in this context refers to accompaniment. It is an accompaniment
unparalleled to any other and cannot be comprehended through mere
information or a knowledge that it exists. The matter is one that needs
to be experienced, not just know n about.
As some have said:
Your image is in m y mind and your mention is on m y tongue — your
dwelling is in m y heart, where can you escape?

Another o f them said:

399

The Disease A nd The Cure

It is strange that I feel com passion for them — and I ask about
them w hom ever I find yet they are w ith me
My eye seeks them out whilst they are inside it — and m y heart
longs for them yet they are w ith in m y chest
That is subtler than the statement o f some others:
If I say you are gone, m y heart will not believe me — as you are within it,
the secret place, you will not escape it
Or if I say you are not gone, m y thoughts will say you have lied — I am
con/used between the truth and the lies

Hence, there is nothing closer to the one w ho is in love than the beloved,
and the love may even establish itself until it becomes closer to the
person than his own self by forgetting himself and failing to forget the
beloved. As one poet said:
I want to forget her but — it is as if Layla manifests to me on every path

Another one said:
It is demanded of the heart to forget you — but the ego fails to do so

if we return to the aforementioned narration, we see that the hearing,
the sight, the hand and the leg are mentioned because these are the body
parts used for comprehension and action, whilst the hearing and the
sight convey the likes and dislikes to the heart and induce the love and
hate to it and the hands and the feet are also used in this. So if a person’s
and sight [missing word? “hearing”] are through the guidance o f Allah
and both are preserved within the limbs that are used to comprehend
and maintained in his love and hate, it will likewise be preserved in his
hand movements and his walking.
Contemplate over how He has sufficed in m entioning the hearing and
the sight and the hands and the feet over the tongue. Notice how one
can comprehend through hearing that occurs willingly at times and
400

The Disease A n d The Cure

unwillingly at others, and the eyesight that tends to occur suddenly
w ithout choice, likewise the hands and the feet that the individual must
use. H ow then is the state o f the tongue that does not act w ithout the
free will and choice o f the person that he can choose to not use in any
prohibited act? Moreover, the reactions o f the tongue from the heart are
more telling than the reactions o f the other body parts as it is the
transmitter and conveying messenger o f the heart. Reflect how Allah has
actualized the aid He affords His servants through their hearing, their
sight, their hands movements and the walking through His statement:
“...his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his
hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he w alks...” in a
manner that shows that He is with His servant in aid and support and
the servant can only carry such actions out through His aid and guidance
through these senses o f hearing and sight and the movement o f his hands
and feet.
Reflect over His statement and the usage o f the [Arabic] letter ‘ha’ (which
indicates guidance and aid) preceding the noun as opposed to the letter
‘lain’ (which indicates for my sake). Perhaps one may suspect that the
‘lam ’ is more befitting in this context as it is more indicative o f the overall
objective and the reality that such actions are done for the sake o f Allah
and that it is more specific than the occurrence o f such actions through
His guidance and aid. However, this is a misconstrued understanding
and an error in judgm ent, as the letter ‘ba’ here does not only refer to
‘assistance’ as none o f the actions o f the righteous or the immoral can be
completed without the ability granted to them by Allah. Thus, the letter
‘ba’ in this regard refers to the constant assistance and aid (not an
accompaniment o f immanentism or pantheism), i.e., the individual
hears, sees, grasps and walks whilst I am his aid and supporter, as is the
meaning in the other narration: “1 am with My servant as long as he

401

The Disease A n d The Cure

remembers Me and his lips move in My m ention.”' This is the exclusive
accompaniment that has been mentioned in the statement o f Allah:

“D o not grieve, indeed Allah is w ith us.” [At-Tawbah:40], and the
statement o f the Prophet: “W hat do you think o f two people whom
Allah is the third .”2 and in the statement o f Allah:
aiiT j[ j
“Indeed, Allah is w ith the good-doers.” [al-‘Ankabut:69],
And His statement:

“Indeed, Allah is w ith those w ho have piety and those w ho do

And His statement:

“N ay, indeed, m y Lord is w ith m e, He shall guide m e.” [AsShu’ara:62]
And His address to Prophets(s) Musa and Harun:

“Indeed, I am w ith you, H earing and Seeing.” [Ta Ha:46]
It is evident through this that the meaning o f the ‘B a ’ in the narration
better provided this meaning o f accompaniment as opposed to the ‘lam ’.
Additionally, the true essence o f sincerity, patience, reliance in Allah and
the correct level o f servitude cannot be attained except through the
meaning o f this (letter) ‘B a ’ and this level o f accompaniment. Hence,
whenever the servant is with Allah, all difficulties dwindle, and the
dreadful affairs become a comfort for the person. It is with Allah’s
guidance and support that any difficulty can be simplified, any hardship
becomes easy and any distant vision draws close. It is with Allah’s aid
and guidance that all worries, anxieties and sorrow disappear.
There is not a worry whilst Allah is with you, nor can there be any
anxiety or sorrow unless he squanders the meaning that has been
referred to through this letter ‘B a’, in which case, his heart becomes like
a fish outside o f water, gasping to breath and twisting and turning
violently until it is placed back into the water. So when this
correspondence between the servant and his Lord actualizes, the Lord
further aids His servants in his needs and desires. He said: “Ifhe asks Me,
I shall certainly give him, and if he seeks refuge in Me, I shall surely
grant him refuge.” i.e., as he has complied to My commands by
implementing My orders and seeking a nearness to Me through the
actions that are beloved to Me; consequently, I shall afford him his aims

403

The Disease A nd The Cure

and aspirations in whatever he asks o f Me to do for him or seeks refuge
in Me from. This force is so strong from both the Lord and His servant
that it amounts to the Lord disliking the inevitable death o f His servant
because the servant himself dislikes death, and the Lord dislikes what the
servant dislikes and dislikes to harm him. It is from this perspective that
He does not like to remove his soul.
However, such a person’s death is to their own advantage, because He
has not caused his death except to grant him the true existence, He has
not decreed his illness except to grant him full health, He has not afflicted
him with poverty except to enrich him, He has not denied him o f things
except to give him other things, He did not expel him from Paradise
whilst in the loins o f his father except to re-admit them into it in the
best manner and He did not say to the father o f mankind ‘Exit it’ except
that He wanted to re-admit him back into it. This is truly the beloved
One, in fact, if every root o f hair on a person carried the utmost love for
Allah, it would only amount to some o f Allah’s right over His servant.
Transfer your heart wherever you will — true love is only to the first love
H ow many places on the earth does a person love — but he yearns for the
first place he ever was

Finally, there is the stage o f A t-T a ta y y u m , which is the final level o f love,
and it is when the one who loves subjugates themselves to their beloved.
This term is used if the emotion o f love has subjugated the person to
their beloved one. It can also be said: ‘taytnu-A llah’ meaning ‘the servant
of A lla h ’. The true reality o f ‘worship’ is to degrade and submit oneself
to their beloved one. It can also be said: ‘the path is m u ’abad (servile)’ i.e.,
degraded by the pedestrians. Hence, the servant has been degraded and
subjugated by his love for his beloved one. Therefore, the noblest
position for a man and the highest platform he can hold is servitude to
Allah; no level is more noble. Allah has mentioned the most noble
creation and the most beloved to Him as being in servitude to Him in
404

The Disease A n d The Cure

the most noble scenarios, such as in the case o f inviting to Allah, or the
challenge set to his opposition in their attempt to disprove his prophethood or the instance o f the night journey into the heavens.

to his complete servitude to Allah and the complete forgiveness that
Allah afforded him.
Allah created His creatures for them to devote their worship to Him
alone without any partners, which is the most complete expression of
love alongside the most comprehensive level o f degradation and
subjugation. This is actually the true form o f Islam and the religion o f
Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham), whom none other than those who fool
themselves are averse to. Allah said:

“And w ho would be averse to the religion o f Ibrahim (Abraham)
except one w ho makes a fool o f himself? And W e had chosen him
in this world, and indeed he, in the Hereafter w ill be am ong the
righteous. And w hen his Lord said to him , ‘Submit’, he said, ‘I
have submitted [in Islam] to the Lord o f creation’. And Ibrahim
(Abraham) instructed his sons, ‘O m y sons, indeed Allah has
chosen for you this religion, so do not die except as Muslims.’ Or
were you witnesses w hen death approached Y a’qub (Jacob), w hen
he said to his sons, ‘W hat w ill you worship after I am gone?’ They
said, ‘W e will worship your Lord, the Lord o f your forefathers,
Ibrahim (Abraham) and Isma Tl and Ishaq (Isaq), one Lord, and we
are Muslims to H im .’” [al-Baqarah:130-133]
Hence, the gravest sin in the sight o f Allah is polytheism (shirk), and
Allah does not forgive the one who fails to repent from it. The origin o f
406

The Disease A n d The Cure

polytheism stems from the association in expressing a devotion o f love,

“And am ong the people are those w ho take other than Allah as
equals - they love them as they should love Allah. But those w ho
believe are stronger in love for Allah.” [al-Baqarah:165]
Here, Allah informs that there are people who associate partners with
Him, taking other than Allah as equal, loving them as they love Allah.
He also informs that those who believe in Him love Him more than the
idolaters love their false deities.
It has also been explained that the meaning is that they possess more love
for Allah than the polytheists have for Allah. Even if they happen to have
some love for Allah, when they shared a portion o f this love with their
false deities, their love for Allah diminished. Yet the monotheists have
more love than them as their love is exclusively devoted to Allah.
Equating between the Lord o f creation and likening Him to these false
deities stems from a love, as we have previously mentioned.
Since the objective that Allah has set for us for His creation is to single
Him alone in worship, He severely reprimanded the one who sets a
protector or intercessor. In some instances, He mentions this singularly,
and during other times He couples them. Allah said:

cij

“It is Allah W h o created the heavens and the earth in six days, then
He rose above the throne. You have not besides H im any protector
or any intercessor, so will you not be reminded?” [As-Sajda:4]

“And warn by the Qur’an those w ho fear that they w ill be

[al-An am :5l]
W hen He mentioned each one singularly, He said:

“Or have they taken other than Allah as intercessors? Say, ‘Even
though they do not possess power over anything, nor do they
reason?’” [Az-Zumar:43]
If a servant allies with his Lord alone, He grants the intercession to him
and enacts the alliance between Him and His believing servants;
consequently, they become His righteous allies as opposed to those who
take another creature as a protector besides Allah. One type o f individual
is o f one color, and the other is another color in totality. Just as the
polytheistic intercession is one shade and the true and established
monotheistic intercession that can only be attained through
monotheism is another shade completely. This is a distinct point that
separates the people o f monotheism (tawhid) from the people o f
polytheism (shirk), and Allah guides whomsoever He wills to the
straight path.

The Love o f Allah Is from the Necessities o f
Servitude to Him
This means that true servitude and worship cannot be attained whilst
partners are being set alongside Allah in the worship, as opposed to
loving something for the sake o f Allah, which is from the necessities o f
servitude and an essential requirement. Indeed, loving the Messenger o f
Allah^ -in fact, placing his love before one’s own self, his parents and
children- is an act that faith cannot be completed without, as his love is
from the love towards Allah and it is the love for Allah’s sake. al-Bukhari
and Muslim have both collected a narration on the authority o f Anas bin
Malik who narrates that the Prophet said: “There are three qualities
whoever has them, will taste the sweetness o f faith.” and in another
wording in al-Bukhari: “None shall find the sweetness o f faith unless
they have these three characteristics... To love Allah and His Messenger
more than anyone else, to love a slave (of Allah) only for the sake o f
Allah and to abhor returning to unbelief after Allah has saved him from
it as he would abhor to be throw n into the Hellfire .”1
As for the other narration: “W hoever loves for Allah’s sake, hates for
Allah’s sake, gives for Allah’s sake and denies for Allah’s sake has
completed their faith .”2

The Four Types o f Love
The following are the four types o f love that must be distinguished from
one another, and those who have gone astray have only done so through
a failure to differentiate between them.
One: The love devoted to Allah. However, it is not sufficient alone to
save an individual from His punishment or to attain His rewards. Indeed,
even the pagans, the worshippers o f the cross, the Jews and many others
have some kind o f love towards Allah.
Second: The love o f whatever Allah loves. This is the one that enters an
individual into Islam and releases him from unbelief, and the most
beloved people to Allah are those who are most fulfilling o f this kind o f
love and the most adherent to it.
Third: The love for the sake o f Allah. This type is from the essentials of
loving whatever He loves, and this kind cannot be truly realized unless
an individual loves for His sake.
Fourth: Loving something alongside Allah. This is the polytheistic form
o f love. Anyone who loves something (in worship) alongside Allah has
taken this object as a partner besides Allah, and this is the love that
emanated from the pagans.
There is a fifth type left to mention that is unrelated to our current
discussion and that is natural love. It is to incline towards something or
someone compatible to a person’s character, such as the love that a
thirsty person may have for drinking water, or the love a hungry person
may have towards food or a love for sleep or a spouse or a person’s own
offspring. Such a kind is not dispraised unless it diverts the person from

remembering Allah or preoccupies an individual from loving Allah, as

Al-Khulla - The Highest Form o f Love
Then there is a type called al-K hulla. It consists o f a complete love that
has reached its pinnacle point in a manner by which there is no space in
the heart for anyone other than their beloved one, and it is a station that
cannot be shared in any form or fashion. This station has exclusively
been afforded to two people -m ay they be mentioned in the highest
gathering and the blessings o f Allah be bestowed upon them - they are
the Messengers M uham m ad^ and Ibrahim (Abraham), as the Messenger
of Allah^ said: “Allah has taken me as a khalil, as He has taken Ibrahim
as a khalil."' Also collected in the Sahih o f Muslim, the Prophet states: “If
I were to hold anyone from mankind as a khalil, I would have taken Abu
Bakr as my khalil', however, your companion (referring to himself) is the
khalil o f Allah.”2 In another narration: “I free myself o f the exclusive love
o f every K halil .”3
W hen Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) beseeched his Lord for a child, he
was provided one and his heart became attached with the love o f this
child devoting a part o f him to it. Allah disliked that His khalil share a
portion o f this love to other than Him, so he commanded Prophet
Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his own child, and this command was
ordained through a dream Ibrahim had. Applying this command is o f
the most difficult calamities and trials to bear. However, the intent was

not the sacrifice o f the child; rather, it was the sacrifice o f the child from
this attachment to the heart so that the heart can be in sole devotion to
the Lord. Thereafter, when Prophet Ibrahim hastened to fulfill this
command and give preference to the love o f Allah over the love o f his
own child, the objective was achieved and thus the burden of
slaughtering was uplifted. Instead, he was awarded a hefty sheep because
Allah does not ordain something and then remove it in totality without
any trace, rather He allows some o f its remnants to remain or exchanges
it as He preserved the legality o f slaughter for His sake, and the
legitimacy o f presenting an offering o f charity to Him alone before
beseeching Him, or as He maintained the command o f establishing five
daily prayers after removing the burden o f fifty throughout the day
whilst maintain the reward for fifty through the act o f five. As He
declared in a divine narration: “My W ord does not change, they are five
prayers, and will be recorded for you as fifty in the reward .”1
As for what is suspected by some o f those who have erred in this matter
that a standard emotion o f love is more powerful than hhulla and that
Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) is the hhalil (receiving the highest level of
exclusive love) o f Allah whilst Prophet Muhammad^fe is the beloved one
to Allah is all due to ignorance. The typical love is general and
encompassing, whereas the khullah is specific and it is the pinnacle o f
love. The Prophet informed that Allah has ordained him as a khalil and
negated that he has a khalil besides his Lord whilst also declaring his love
for his wife A’isha, her father, Umar bin al-Khattab and others.
Additionally, Allah loves the repentant ones, He loves those who purify
themselves, He loves the patient ones, He loves the good doers, He loves
the pious and He loves the just ones. However, His khulla is exclusively
afforded to only two Prophets, and the repentant youth is a beloved one

The Intellectual O ne Favors the Highest o f T w o
Beloved Options and the Least Detrim ental o f
the Harms
It has preceded that an individual never relinquishes something they love
and desire unless it is for something else that they love and desire.
However, they leave the thing that they have the least love for in place
o f something their love is stronger towards, just as he may implement
something that he dislikes in order to attain something that he has a
stronger love towards, or to rid oneself o f a harm that he detests more
than the dislike o f the action he is implementing.
It has also been previously mentioned that the duty o f the mind is to
favor the more beloved action and the least detrimental, and we
mentioned earlier that this is the perfection in strength o f love and hate.
However, this cannot be truly realized w ithout the presence o f two
matters: A strong comprehension, and the courage o f the heart. As an
absence o f such characteristics and any opposing actions will arise as a
result o f a weakness in comprehension in that an individual fails to
comprehend the appropriate status o f the beloved or the disliked matters,
or it may be due to a weakness and deficiency in the soul and an inability
within the heart that prevents someone from realizing what is more
beneficial for them despite know ing it is more beneficial. So if a person’s
comprehension is sound, his soul is strong and his heart delves to find
sufficient courage to favor the highly beloved over the most detrimental,
he should realize that he has been guided towards the means o f
happiness. There are some who are dominated by the force o f desires
more than the force o f their intellect and faith; thus, the stronger force
417

The Disease A n d The Cure

overpowers the weak. There are others who have a stronger command
of faith and presence o f mind than the force o f their desires. Hence, since
many o f the sickly are protected through the doctor’s practice from
ailments that are o f harm to them, yet the patient is prevented by their
own soul and desire avoiding the illness favoring his desires over the
sound intellect. The doctors call this condition ‘a deficiency in character’
and this is the condition o f the majority o f those who have been afflicted
with a sick heart, as they prefer the things that increase their illness due
to the intense level o f desire they have for it.
The basis o f all evil is due to a deficiency in understanding and a
weakness and an inferiority in the soul. Whereas the basis o f all good
comes from distinction in understanding and a strength and courage
that emanates from the soul. Therefore, love and intent are the source
and basis for all actions, as hatred and dislike are a basis and source to
abandon an action. Both o f these forces in the heart are the basis for the
happiness o f a servant or his destruction. The presence o f an action
under one’s own will can only come to pass through the presence o f its
reasons, such as love and intent. As for the absence o f action, at times it
is due to an absence o f its requisites or its reasons, and at times it can be
due to a preventative hatred or dislike. All o f which is in connection
with the commands and the prohibitions, and it is likewise connected to
the reward or the punishment. Through this, the ambiguity pertaining
to the act o f withholding from something becomes clear as far as
whether it is an action itself or not. After close scrutiny, we gather that
this matter divides into two categories: If there is an abandonment o f an
action that happens w ithout effort, then the abandonment here is not
considered an action in itself. However, if it is a result o f an action that
prevents the action taking place i.e., the abandonment, then here it is an
action in itself.

The Most Astute Are the Ones W ho Value the
Perm anent Pleasure o f the Hereafter O ver the
Dim inishing Pleasures o f the W orldly Life
Each o f the actions o f withholding from something or partaking in it
through their own will is valued by a person due to the benefit and
pleasure that is gained through it, or the relief from a pain that is felt.
Hence, the proverb states: “He remedied his chest and remedied his
heart.”
This is an objective that the intellectual one and even the wild animal
will consider, yet most people will horrendously err in it by pursuing a
pleasure that shall result in great pain. Thus, he pains himself from the
very place he thinks he will receive pleasure and treats his own heart
with something that will draw the most severe illness. In fact, this is the
condition o f the one who restricts his vision to the luxuries o f this life
w ithout considering the consequences, and the duty o f the mind is to
reflect on the consequences. The most mindful people are those who
value the permanent pleasure and comfort o f the afterlife over this soon
to end diminishing life, whereas the most feebleminded members o f the
creation are those who trade an everlasting bliss, a permanently pleasant
life and the greatest pleasure that does not contain any troubles or
deficiency in any fashion for a bitter life filled with pain and hazards that
is swiftly disappearing.
Some o f the scholars have said: “I have thought about the things that the
astute people strive in search for, and I have realized that all o f their
endeavors are in search o f one objective, even if their methods in
attaining it differ. I have realized that they all endeavor to repel any
419

The Disease A n d The Cure

worry and anxiety from themselves. O ne may attempt to do so through
food and drink, another through business transactions and profit,
another through marriage, another through listening to music or
enchanting sounds and someone else may attempt to do so through
nonsensical idleness and play. So, I said to myself: This is the objective
o f the intellectuals, but all o f these methods do not lead a person to it.
Instead, perhaps the majority o f them may lead to the opposite effect. I
declare that I have not realized any path amongst these many paths that
lead to this objective other than the devotion to Allah and worshipping
Him alone and preferring His pleasure over all else.”
As for the one who treads this path, if they miss out on a portion o f the
worldly life, he will surely gain a portion o f something lofty and
sufficient. If the servant attains this, he has gained all that he needs, but
if he loses out on it, he has lost out on everything he needs. Yet if he
gains a portion o f the worldly life alongside this, he would have attained
the rest in the most pleasant way. There is nothing more beneficial for
an individual than treading this path or any path more effective in
leading to his sought-after pleasures, bliss and joy, and it is Allah W ho
grants success.

W hatever Is Beloved Can Be Divided Into T w o
Categories
Something that is directly beloved and something that is beloved for
other reasons. However, the object that is beloved for other reasons will
inevitably return to the O ne W ho is directly beloved. Anything other
than Allah is beloved for other reasons, and there is nothing that is
directly beloved except Allah, and anything else that is loved is done so
secondary to the Lord, such as the love towards the Angels, His Prophets
or His righteous allies. All o f which are secondary to His love but are
also requisites to His love as the love towards the beloved necessitates a
love to whatever they love. This is a point that must be considered, as it
is a distinguishing point between the beneficial type o f secondary love
and the type o f love that is o f no benefit and could be harmful.
Know that none is loved directly except the O ne W ho is perfect in
essence and W hose essence deserves a sole right to W orship and W ho is
the true Lord and Self-Sufficient in His essence. Anything besides Him
is to be detested or disliked according to its rejection o f love and its
enmity. Therefore, whatever is more distant to what He loves is also
proportionally more detested.
This is fair measure that can be used to gauge the adherence to the Lord
or the opposition towards Him as well as one’s allegiance or
disassociation. If we see an individual w ho loves the things that the Lord
dislikes and hates what the Lord loves, we can ascertain through this that
there is enmity. O n the other hand, if we see an individual who loves
what the Lord loves, dislikes what He dislikes, whilst the more
something is beloved to the Lord, the more it becomes more beloved to

421

The Disease A n d The Cure

the individual and more valued and the more something is disliked by
the Lord, the more the individual dislikes it and distances it from himself,
we ascertain that he holds an allegiance to the Lord in accordance to this
level o f allegiance and love. So adhere to this principal as much as
possible within your own scope and the scope o f others, because
allegiance is compliance to the judgm ent o f Allah in whatever He loves
or hates, not merely through a flawed practice o f abundant fasting or
praying or empty gestures.
Additionally, something that is loved for a reason other than itself can
also be divided into two categories:
One: Something that is a source o f pleasure once attained for the person
w ho expresses this love.
Second: Something that initially draws some pain, but the person
withstands this pain because it leads to something that is beloved to
them, such as consuming a bitter medicine.
Allah said:

“Fighting has been enjoined upon you w hile it is hateful to you.
But perhaps you hate a th in g and it is good for you, and perhaps
you love a th in g and it is bad for you. Allah know s, w hile you
k n ow n o t.” [al-Baqarah:216]
Here, Allah informs that fighting is disliked to them, yet it is better for
them due to it resulting to the most beloved and beneficial thing to
them.
The soul loves comfort, inactivity and luxury, but that is detrimental to
it since it leads to squandering the beloved objective. Hence, the astute
422

The Disease A n d The Cure

person does not look to the beloved objective o f the worldly life to value
it over all else or to the pains o f the worldly life in an earnest desire for
them, as all this can be a source o f evil for the individual and could bring
forth the most intense pain and concurrently lose out on the greatest
pleasure. In fact, the thinkers o f the worldly life bear the disliked
hardships in it in exchange for the pleasure they shall experience at the
end o f each hardship, even if it is short-lived.
Such affairs are divided under four categories:
•
•
•
•

A discomfort that leads to further discomfort
A discomfort that leads to something beloved
Something beloved that leads to something else beloved
Something beloved that leads to a discomfort

The beloved object that leads to something else that is beloved combines
a motivation from two perspectives, and the discomfort that leads to
further discomfort also combines the motivation to abandon it from two
perspectives.
However, there are two further categories that contain a resisting force
for their motivation. They both make up the battleground for the trials
and tests that are experienced. So the soul favors whatever is closest to it,
which is the worldly life, whilst the intellect and faith both favor what
is more beneficial and longer lasting, whilst the heart remains in the
middle swaying to one side at times and the other side at other times.
Here appears the trial. The motivation within the intellect and in a
person’s faith constantly calls out: “Hasten to success...in the morning,
a man will be grateful for the ease but at the time o f death, a man will
be grateful for having had piety .”1 If the darkness [hardship] o f love

The O rigin o f All Religious Actions
Since love is the origin o f all action, whether the action is truth or
falsehood, then the origin o f all religious action must be the love o f Allah
and His Messenger, just as the origin o f religious statements is the true
belief in Allah and His Messenger.
Any desire that denies the absolute love towards Allah and His
Messenger or attempts to compete with it or any doubt that obstructs
total belief is contrary to the origin o f faith or at least an aspect that
weakens it. If this contrasting factor strengthens until it is in complete
opposition to the basis o f this love and belief, it becomes a form o f major
unbelief and polytheism. If it does not reach such a level, it becomes a
stain on its perfection and will contribute to its weakness and
estrangement in conviction. It veils the person, severs their endeavor
and causes relapse.
True allegiance cannot be correct w ithout enmity, as Allah says about
the leader o f the monotheists that he said:

“He said, ‘T hen do you see w hat you have been w orshipping, you
and your ancient forefathers, indeed, they are enem ies to me except the Lord o f creation.’” [A sh-Shu’araa:75-77]
Therefore, the K halil o f Allah never attained this level o f love without
actualizing this particular enmity, as there cannot be any allegiance
425

The Disease A n d The Cure

w ithout a disassociation to something else and there is no allegiance to
Allah without a disassociation to anything that is worshipped besides
Him. Allah said:

Thus, He has made this allegiance to Allah and the disassociation from

statement o f salvation from the punishment o f the grave and the

and the key to the abode o f Paradise. Due to it, the people are divided
into two groups, one is wretched and the other is joyous, one has been
accepted and the other is to be banished. Due to this statement, the lands
o f disbelief and the lands o f faith are separate, and the blessed lands have
been distinguished from the wretched and the lowly. It is the pillar that
gives rise to the obligations and the Siimiah and “W hoever’s last words

The Core Essence o f ‘La Ilaha Ilia Allah’ [There
Is N one W orthy o f W orship Besides Allah]
The essence and true meaning o f this statement is to single the Lord exalted is He in His Names and Actions w ithout there being anyone
worthy o f worship besides Him - in love, exaltation, fear, hope and
anything associated to this such as reliance, repentance, disposition and
veneration. None should be loved in worship besides Him, and anyone
other than Him that is loved is only done so secondarily to the love
towards Allah and that loving other than Allah in this manner is a means
to an increased love o f Allah. None should be feared in worship or placed
hope in, or relied on, or have a disposition towards, or venerated, or
sworn in the name of, or made an oath in the name of, or repented to,
or absolutely obeyed, or seek a reward from or asked for aid in difficult
situations, or seek refuge in, or prostrated to, or slaughter in the name
o f besides Allah. All o f which is combined in one statement, which is to
refuse any form o f worship to anyone other than Him, and this is the
actualization o f ‘La Ilaha Ilia A lla h ’ [there is none w orthy o f worship
besides Allah.]
Hence, Allah has forbidden the Hellfire from consuming anyone who
truly testifies that there is none w orthy o f worship besides Allah. It is an
impossibility for anyone who truly actualizes the statement o f 1La Ilaha
Ilia A lla h ’ [there is none w orthy o f worship besides Allah] and lives by
it in uprightness to enter the Hellfire. Allah says:

“And those w ho are in their testim onies upright.” [al-M a’arij:33]
429

The Disense A n d The Cure

Upright inwardly within the heart and outwardly. Undoubtedly, there
are people whose testimony w ithin their own selves is dead, and there
are others that are in slumber, and if it is triggered it awakens and there
are others that are reclining and there are others that are closer to being
upright. This testimony is equivalently important to the heart as the soul
is to the body, and a dead or sick soul is closer to its death, whereas a
soul that is closer to a full life is better in establishing the benefits for the
body.
The authentic narration states: “I know a word which no one says at the
time o f death except that their soul will find comfort and mercy .”1
The life o f the soul can only survive through the existence o f this
statement within it, just as the body can only contain life in it through
the presence o f the soul. Also, the one who dies in belief o f this statement
shall enter Paradise and reside therein, and whoever actualizes it
throughout their life shall have their soul dwell in Paradise as a final
refuge and shall live the most pleasant of lives, as Allah said:
1'

“But as for he w ho feared the position o f his Lord and prevented
the soul from [unlawful] inclination, then indeed, Paradise w ill be
his abode.” [A n-N azi’at:40-4l]
So Paradise is his final destination o f refuge on the day he shall meet
Allah, whereas the paradise o f know ing Him, loving Him, finding
comfort in remembering Him, yearning to meet Him, the jo y and
pleasure in being His servant is all the refuge he experiences in this life.
Therefore, whoever has this as a paradise in this life, shall consequently
receive the eternal Paradise on the day o f final return. But whoever has

been denied this paradise in this life, consequently, he is more
undeserving o f the Paradise in the Hereafter. The righteous are in bliss
even if they live through difficulties and this life becomes constricted for
them, and the immoral ones are in torm ent even if this life has been
made luxurious and comfortable for them. Allah said:

N othing Is More Beneficial for a Person Than
D evotion to Allah
The more the presence o f a particular thing is more beneficial for an
individual and he is in need o f it more, the more intense his pain will be
if he misses out on it. And the more beneficial its absence is, the more
the pain is felt by its presence. There is nothing more beneficial for an
individual than devoting oneself to Allah, occupying oneself with His
remembrance, being blessed with His love and favoring His pleasure. In
fact, there is not a life worth living, or a favor worth having, or happiness
w orth feeling or a joy worth experiencing w ithout it. The absence o f it
is the most painful feeling and the harshest torm ent for the individual.
Yet the soul is superficially concealed from this pain by being occupied
by something else and being engrossed in another matter. So it is masked
from its reality o f its true state o f pain and loss through missing out on
the most beloved and beneficial thing to it. This is equivalent to the state
o f the drunkard who is sinking in his alcoholism, such as the one who
has had his home burnt to the ground and lost his possessions and family
but does not feel this pain o f loss and sorrow due to his deep intoxication
until the inebriation is lifted and he awakens from the unconsciousness,
at which point he will realize his condition. The situation is the same
whether the inebriation is removed and the Hereafter is in sight and you
are on the verge o f departing from this life onto the meeting with Allah;
rather, the sorrow and torm ent at such a mom ent is many times more
painful. As the one who has been afflicted with a calamity connected to
this life hopes that the affliction is replaced and knows that whatever he
has been afflicted with is something that will disappear and not remain.
433

The Disease A n d The Cure

How then will it be if one is afflicted with a calamity that holds no
compensation, no replacement and is incomparable to the worldly life?
if Allah decreed death to this individual to end this sorrow and pain, it
would have been more befitting for that individual, and death would be
the largest wish and the deepest sorrow. This would be the case if the
pain were only as a result o f losing out, let alone the torm ent that shall
be inflicted on the soul and the body through other tangible means that
cannot be repelled. Exalted be He, the O ne who assigned this weak
creation the two significant burdens that not even the sturdy mountains
could bear.
Now, present to yourself the most beloved thing to you in this life
whereby if it were taken away from you, you would not feel any
pleasure in this life. Then imagine it was taken away from you and a
barrier was placed between both o f you in your most needy moment,
how would you feel? Imagine this feeling even though this beloved
thing can be replaced, so reflect over the thing that can never be
replaced.
A nything, if you lose it, it can be replaced — but there isn’t a replacement for

The O rigin o f All Happiness Is the Love o f Allah
and the Love o f W hatever He Loves
Love is a generic term that encompasses a range o f varying types o f love
in its amount and description. Since the case is as such, most o f what is
mentioned about it pertaining to Allah is His exclusive right and that
which befits His Majesty and is unbefitting for anyone other than Him
such as the love o f worship, repentance and the like. Indeed, it is
unlawful to devote either o f the two acts to anyone other than Allah.
Love can also be mentioned using its unrestricted and general term, such
as in the statement o f Allah:

“Allah w ill bring forth a people w hom He loves, and they love
H im .” [al-M a’idah:54]
And His statement:

“From the people are those w ho take other than Allah as partners,
they love them as they love Allah, but those w h o believe love Allah
m ore.” [al-Baqarah:165]
The greatest form o f the dispraised form o f love is to associate someone
in this love alongside Allah whereby the individual equates the beloved
one he has associated with Allah with the love o f Allah. O n the other
side o f the spectrum, the greatest form o f praised love is to devote the

435

The Disease A n d The Cure

love o f worship to Allah alone and the love o f what He loves. This love
is the basis o f all joy that none can be saved from the punishment except
by way o f it. Whereas the dispraised polytheistic love is the basis o f all
wretchedness which will lead those who perpetrate it into the torment.
The people who ascribe to the praiseworthy true love are those who love
Allah, worship Him alone without associating any partners with Him,
they shall not abide in the Hellfire, and whoever enters it from them
shall not remain therein forever.
The Q ur’an often orders with this type o f love and its requisites, as well
as forbidding the unlawful form o f love and its requisites. It also strikes
similitudes and analogies for both types, narrates stories about both types
alongside details o f the actions for both, those who undertake them and
those who are worshipped through them. It also mentions information
about the actions o f both types and the status in all three abodes: the life
of this world, the life in the grave and the eternal abode in the Hereafter.
The Q ur’an mentions both types.
The basis o f the message that every Prophet conveyed, from the first o f
them to the seal o f the Prophets was to worship Allah alone without
associating partners in worship with Him. This is a worship that
necessitates a full devotion of love to Him and a full sense o f submission
and abasement towards Him whilst venerating and glorifying Him and
all that this entails from obedience and piety.
It has been authentically reported in the Saluh o f al-BukharT and the
Sahih o f Muslim on the authority o f Anas who narrates that the Prophet
said: “By the O ne whose Hand my soul is in, none o f you shall truly
believe until I become more beloved to them than their child, parent
and all o f the people .”1

Additionally, al-Bukhari' collected a narration in his Sahih that Umar
bin al-Khattab -Allah be pleased with him - said: “Messenger o f Allah 36,
you are surely more beloved to me than everything except myself.” The
Messenger oi Allah36 said to him: “No Umar, until I am more beloved
to you than your own self.” Umar then responded: “By the O ne W ho
sent you with the truth, you are more beloved to me than my own self.”
The Prophet then said: “Now, O ’ Umar.”
If this is how His servant and Messenger should be loved and placed
before the love o f one’s ow n self, their children, their parents and all the
people, what do you suspect the case would be pertaining to the One
W ho sent him and where the love devoted to Him should be placed?
The love o f the Lord the Most High is especially different from any love
towards anyone else in its quantity, description and exclusivity to Him
alone. The obligation is that this love from the servant towards the Lord
exceeds the love o f his child and parents and even his ow n hearing, sight
and soul that is within him. Thus, the true deity, the O ne he worships
in truth becomes more beloved to him than all o f this.
Some things may be beloved from a particular perspective as opposed to
others and it could also be love due to a secondary outcome. However,
none other than Allah is loved unconditionally from every perspective
and worship cannot be true unless it is directed to Him alone, Allah says:

Any M ovement Is M otivated by Love
Any movement within the creation o f the heavens or on the earth
originates from a type of love. Love is the reason for it being in effect
and the objective behind it. This is because the movements are o f three
types: movement o f choice and want, a natural movement and a forced
movement.
The natural form is original a form o f stillness and the body will make a
movement once it leaves its natural position; therefore, it moves in order
to regain its natural state o f stillness. It only makes this movement due
to the force that compels it to do so, alongside the natural movement it
makes in seeking a return back to its original state o f stillness. So both
types o f movement are a result o f the compelling force; thus, it is the
basis o f both types o f movement.
As for the movement o f choice and want, it is also a basis for the other
two types as it complies with the wants and the love o f an individual.
Thus, all three types o f movements comply with a person’s love and
wants.
The proof for this restriction into three categories is that if the one who
is moving sense a feeling that urges them to make a move, then it is due
to a want to do so, but if they do not sense an urge to move, then it
either falls under the natural form or does not. The first o f which is
natural and the second is compelling.
Once this has been established, it is evident to see that whatever is in the
heavens and the earth and anything in between them o f the movement
o f the celestial figures, the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the clouds,
the rain, the plants and the unborn fetus in the womb all move through
439

The Disease A n d The Cure

the Angels who act as intermediaries that direct and apportion each
matter as the text o f the Q ur’an and Sunnah indicate in numerous places.

440

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Belief in the Angels
Belief in the above is part o f the complete belief in the Angels. Indeed,
Allah has assigned Angels for the womb, Angels for the raindrops,
Angels for the plants, the wind, the celestial figures and for the sun, the
moon and the stars.
He has also assigned four Angels to every human being, one on each
side to write the deeds and one in front o f the person and one behind
him for protection. He has assigned Angels that collect the souls at the
time o f death and prepare them for their abode in Paradise or the
Hellfire. There are also Angels that descend to ask and test an individual
in their grave to either execute the torm ent or present the blessings,
there are also other Angels that lead the people to the plain o f ground
that the people shall stand on after Resurrection and Angels that will
inflict the torm ent on the people in the Hellfire or accommodate for the
blessings in Paradise. He assigned Angels to the mountains, and Angels
to deliver the clouds to wherever they have been commanded to be, He
assigned Angels to dispatch the rain by the decree and command o f Allah
as He wills. He assigned Angels to plant the fruits o f Paradise, work
therein and maintain it and for the Hellfire the same.
Thus, the mightiest troops who work for Allah are the Angels, and the
Arabic noun that means Angel ‘M a la k ’gives the perception that they are
messengers that enforced to complete tasks for other than themselves
which they do not have a say in, instead, the command is entirely from
Allah and they merely direct and apportion the command o f Allah and
the actions He has permitted.
Allah says about them:

W e have mentioned the meaning o f the secret behind these oaths taken
by Allah in the book entitled ‘A ym a n al-ImdtT.
Once this is known, then it should also be known that these expressions,
movements, wants and actions are all acts o f worship by them towards
the Lord o f the heavens and the earth and the actions they have been
compelled with are secondary. Had it not been for the feeling o f love,
the celestial bodies would not have moved, or the bright stars, nor would
the winds blow, or the clouds have moved, nor would the unborn fetus
have moved in the mothers womb, nor would any seed have emerged
to produce any plant, nor would the waves flown, nor would the Angels
have moved or would the heavens and the earth along with all the
creation with them have praised their Creator. Exalted be He W ho
receives the praises the praises o f the seven heavens and the earth and all
that is within them, Allah says:

“And there is not a thing except that it exalts Allah by His praise,
but you do not understand their w ay o f exalting. Indeed, He is
ever Forbearing and Forgiving.” [al-Isra:44]

443

The Disease A n d The Cure

Once this has been established, it will be known that every living being
has a love for something and takes actions towards it. Everything that
moves has an origin: love and an urge to do the action.
Any living being that exists cannot be upright unless their movement
and love is devoted to their Creator alone, just as they would not exist
unless He alone created them. It is in this regard that Allah said:
O j alii

j}

“Had there been w ithin the heavens and earth gods besides Allah,
they would both [the heavens and the earth] have been in ruin.”
[al-Anbiya:22]
He -exalted be H e- did not say: ‘they would become extinct’ or ‘they
would both have not existed,’ as He is able to maintain them despite a
corruption within them, but they cannot remain in existence in this
fashion in a correct and upright manner. This correctness and
uprightness can only be achieved if Allah is the only One worshipped
by them and all that they contain. If two gods ruled the creation, the
orderliness o f the creation would have been corrupted to the highest
degree, as each o f the two gods would rival the other, attempt to
overcome the other and single oneself from the other. Polytheism is a
deficiency that negates the possibility o f having a right to worship, and
a true deity would not settle to have a deficiency. If one o f them were
to overpower the other, he would assume the right to worship and it
would be clear that the defeated one would not be a god. However, if
neither one is able to overcome the other, this would necessitate that
both o f them are incapable and have a deficiency and would not be a
true deity. Thus, it is only right that there is O ne true deity above all
that is worshipped in truth that is more powerful than all, ruling above
all. Otherwise, each rival would attempt to claim a part o f the creation
and each would seek supremacy over the other. From that emerges the
44 4

The Disease A n d The Cure

ruin o f the heavens and the earth, as would be the case in the ruin o f a
country if it were ruled by two kings and the ruin o f a wife if she had
two husbands or a camel that lived amongst two stallions. Furthermore,
the origin o f corruption in this universe is due to the differing among
tyrannical kings and rulers. Thus, the enemies o f Islam would not dare
to seek to ruin Islam in any era other than the eras wherein the Muslim
rulers became numerous during their differences and conflict when each
o f them sought independence and supremacy o f each other in their own
lands.
The rectification o f the heavens o f the earth and the uprightness and
order o f the creation in such a perfect manner is from the most obvious
proofs that there is none w orthy o f worship except Allah alone without
any partners, to Him alone belongs complete sovereignty and praise, He
is able to do all things and that every other thing that is worshipped
besides Him from the lofty heavens by the mighty throne to the depths
o f the earth is worshipped in falsehood. Allah says:

“Allah has not taken any son, nor has there ever been w ith H im

Exalted is Allah above w hat they describe. He K now s the unseen

Allah also said:

“Or have m en taken for themselves gods from the earth w ho

they describe. He is not questioned about w hat He does, but they
will be questioned.” [al-Anbiya:21-23]
Allah also said:

“Say: [O M uhammad^] ‘If there had been w ith H im other gods,
as they say, then they would have sought a w ay to the O w ner o f
the throne.” [al-Isra:42]
It has been mentioned that the meaning to this verse is that they would
have sought a way through rivaling one another and overcoming each
other just as the kings do with one another.
This is evident through the other verse:

“ .. .and some o f them would have sought to overcom e others.” [alMu’m inun:9l]
O ur Shaykh [ibn TaymTyah] stated: “The correct meaning is that they
would have sought a way to Him by acts o f obedience and worship, so
how can you worship them besides Allah because if they were, as you
say, deities besides Allah, they would have been subservient to Him?”

446

He further stated: “This is evident from a number o f angles: From them:

‘Those w hom they invoke seek means o f access to their Lord,
striving as to w hich is the nearest, and they hope for His Mercy

In meaning, it is as if He is saying that these beings that you worship
besides Me are My servants just as you are My servants, they hope for
My Mercy and fear My punishment. So why do you worship them
besides Me?
Second angle: Allah the Most exalted did not say: ‘They would have
sought a way to overcome Me.’ Instead, He said: ‘T hey w ould have
sought a w ay t o .. . ’ This terminology is used in the context o f drawing
close to something, just as in the verse:

‘Fear Allah and seek the means o f nearness to H im .’ [alMa’idah:35]
However, in the context o f overcoming something, the wording differs
such as in the verse:

‘If they obey you, seek no means against them .’ [An-Nisa:34]
Third angle: They did not say that their [false] deities try to defeat Him
and seek supremacy over Him, Allah said:

‘Say: [O Muhammad**] ‘If there had been w ith H im other gods, as
they s a y ...’ [al-Isra:42] but they would say: Their deities seek a
nearness to Him and that they draw them closer to Him. So the response
was: Even if the affair was as you claim, they would still be servants to
Him, so why do you worship His servants besides Him?”
This love in worship has effects, consequences, specific features and
rulings whether it is praiseworthy or dispraised, beneficial or harmful or
whether it is tactful or contains sweetness or whether it is something
longed for, something a person finds comfort in or draws an individual
closer to their loved one or disconnects them from them or whether it
contains an obstruction or an abandonment, joy and happiness, tears and
sorrow or otherwise from the rules and features pertaining to this
emotion.
The praised form o f love is the one that benefits and produces a benefit
for the person in their worldly and afterlife. This form o f love is the
banner under which happiness is found, whereas the unbeneficial one
produces harm for the person in their worldly and afterlife, and it is the
banner under which wretchedness is found. It is well established that the
astute person will not choose the love o f something that harms him and
assigns him to misery. This type o f outcome only emanates from
ignorance and injustice since the soul could crave something that harms
it and does not benefit it, but that is oppression from the person on their
own self either due to their own ignorance about the status o f their
beloved one because they desire and love something without knowing
the harms that are contained in loving it. This is the condition o f those
who follow their desires w ithout knowledge. O r in the other case, they
may know about the harms in loving this particular thing, but they favor
their desires over whatever they know. In this case, the love towards this
object may be constructed from two things - a corrupt creed and a
448

The Disease A n d The Cure

dispraised desire. This is the condition o f those who follow their
suspicions and what their souls crave. The corrupted love only emanates
from ignorance and an incorrect belief, an overwhelming desire or
something connected to that that supports it allowing the doubt to
resemble the truth, beautifying the beloved object alongside a desire that
invites to it. Both the force o f the doubts and that o f the desires work
together against the force o f the intellect and faith, and the victorious
one is the stronger o f the two. O nce this is known, it is gathered that
every type o f love carries the ruling o f whatever it loves. So the
beneficial and praiseworthy type o f love that is the source o f a person’s
happiness carries consequences that are all beneficial to the person, and
they carry the same ruling. Hence, if the individual cries it benefits him,
if he feels sorrow it benefits him, if he feels happy it benefits him, if he
feels miserable it benefits him and if he is pleased it also benefits him.
Therefore, he lives amongst the various levels o f love and its
consequences whilst receiving a constant increase o f advantage and
strength.
As for the harmful and dispraised type o f love, its consequences and
effects are all harmful to the individual and distancing from his Lord. As
much as he wishes to live in the midst o f its effects and be involved in
its various degrees, he is at a loss and a distance. This is the case with any
action that is born out o f obedience or sin respectively. Anything that is
produced from obedience is an advantage and a nearness to Allah for the
one who performs the action, but anything that is produced from
disobedience is a loss and further distance for the perpetrator o f the
action. Allah said:

“That is because they are not afflicted w ith thirst or fatigue or

enrages the disbelievers, nor do they inflict upon any enem y any
infliction but it is registered for them as a righteous deed. Indeed,
Allah does not allow to be lost the reward o f the doers o f good.
Nor do they spend an expenditure, small or large, or cross a valley
except that it is registered for them that Allah may reward them
for the best o f what they were d oin g.” [At-Tawbah:120-12l]
Allah informs us in the first o f the two aforementioned verses that the
outcome o f their obedience and actions is registered as righteous deeds.
He then informs us in the second verse that the righteous actions that
they directly fulfilled are themselves recorded for them as righteous
deeds. The difference between the two is that the first is not from their
own actions; rather, they are an outcome o f their actions and so it is
written for them as righteous deeds. Whereas the second one is their
direct actions, so it is also written for them as righteous deeds. The
victim o f love should sincerely contemplate over this segment o f the
answer to know its advantages and disadvantages:
They shall know on the D ay o f Judgm ent what they have — wasted, and on
the scales they shall know what they reaped.

Love and Free W ill Are the O rigin o f Any
Belief
Just as the emotion o f love and the feeling o f free will are the original
motivators for every action, as previously mentioned, they are also both
the origin for every belief, whether it is true or false. Indeed, belief is
from the inward and outward actions, whilst love and free will are the
foundation o f it all.
Religion is comprised o f obedience, custom and moral character. Hence,
it is the inseparable and constant obedience that becomes intrinsic with
moral character and customs, and this is why moral character has been
used to refer to religion in the statement o f Allah:

0 * ^-

“Indeed, you are o f great moral character.” [al-Qalam:4]
Al-Imam Ahmad narrates from Ibn ‘Uyaynah who said that Ibn Abbas
said regarding the exegesis o f the verse: “Indeed, you are upon a mighty
religion.” A’isha -Allah be pleased with her- was asked about the moral
character o f the Prophet to which she replied: “His moral character was
the Q u r’an .”1 W ithin the meaning o f religion is submissiveness and
subjugation and the meaning o f humbleness, compliance and
obedience. Therefore, the superior requests the action from the inferior,
as it has been said: I overpowered him, so he became submissive.

' C ollected by M uslim [746].

451

The Disease A n d The Cure

The action itself comes from the inferior one and is offered to the
superior. It can be said: “I believed and obeyed Allah,” or “so and so does
not obey Allah,” or “so and so does not obey Allah at all,” (the verb used
in these terms is deni). It means “to obey Allah, love Him and fear H im .”
The internal din (religion) here must include love and submission just
like the rest o f the acts o f worship, as opposed to the apparent acts o f
obedience, they do not necessitate a portrayal o f open love for it even
though it may contain submission and humbleness.
Allah named the Day o f Resurrection ‘yaw m ad-din’ because it is the day
the people will profess (yadinu ) their actions, if they were good they shall
receive a good reward, and if they were evil they shall receive an evil
recompense. This includes their recompense (ja za ) and their judgm ent
(hisab), and that is why is has also been called ‘the day o f hisab’ and ‘the
day ofjudgm ent.’
Allah says:

“Then w hy do you not, if you are not to be recompensed, bring it
back.” [al-W aqi’ah:86-87] i.e., return the soul to its place, if it is as
you claim that you are not under O ne Lord, nor are you subdued or be
held to account. Nonetheless, this verse requires an explanation. It was
mentioned to defeat their argument o f rejection o f the Resurrection and
the Final Judgment. It must be noted that the evidence must refer to the
subject matter that is being proven in a manner whereby the thought
process shifts towards the proven mater due to the correlation between
the proof and the proven. Anyone who has been obliged with
something is a proof for the obligation, and the opposite is not
necessarily true.

45 2

The Disease A n d The Cure

If someone rejects the Resurrection and the Final Judgm ent, they have
disbelieved in Allah and denied His perfect ability, Lordship and
Wisdom. So they either accept that they have a Lord that is all powerful
over them W ho chooses to do as He wills with them, He causes them to
die if He wills, gives them life if He wills, commands them and prohibits
them, rewards the good doers and punishes the evil doers, or they fail to
accept the Lord W hose status is as mentioned. If they believe in Him,
they shall consequently believe in the Resurrection and the recompense.
However, if they deny it and disbelieve, then this is their claim that they
are not subjects to a Lord nor are they ruled by One, nor do they have
a Lord that decides their affairs as He wills. So why is it that they are
unable to repel death when it comes to them or return a soul to its place
once it reaches the exit point o f the throat? This is actually an address to
those who are present at the time o f someone’s death as they suffer
through the person’s death. W hy can’t you return his soul to its place if
you have this ability and free-choice as you claim, why is this the case
since you claim not to be subjected to the rule o f a Lord not are you
overpowered by O ne W ho has perfect M ight and Ability w ho passes
His judgm ents on you as He wills and executes His commands on you?
This exhausts their arguments excellently as their inability to return a
single soul from one place to another becomes evidently clear, even if
they combined the help o f every human being and jitm l
W hat an amazing and pertinent verse it is that proves the His Lordship,
Oneness, absolute control over His servants and the accomplishment
and passing o f His judgm ents on them!
The religion is o f two portions: The portion o f the legislation and the
commands and the portion o f the judgm ent and recompense. Both are
under the absolute sovereignty o f Allah, as the religion belongs to Allah
alone whether it is His command or His judgm ent, and the worship o f
love is the basis o f both portions. Indeed, whatever Allah has legislated
453

The Disease A n d The Cure

and commanded with is beloved to Him, and whatever He has
prohibited is disliked and hated to Him due to its opposition to what He
loves and is pleased with. The obedience o f an individual is accepted if
it is based on a love and pleasure for it, as the Prophet said: “He has tasted
the sweetness o f faith. The one who is pleased with Allah as the Lord,
Islam as their religion and M uham m ad^ as his Prophet.” This is based
on love and it is the reason for its legislation. Likewise, the portion o f
the religion that is recompense. Is consists o f rewarding the good doer
for their good and recompensing the evildoer for their evil. Both aspects
are beloved to Allah because they are from His perfect Justice and Virtue
and both are from His perfect Attributes, and He loves His Names and
Attributes and loves those who love them. Both portions are w ithin His
straight path that He is on, He is on a straight and correct path in His
commands, prohibitions, rewards and punishments, as He mentioned
when He informed o f the address His Prophet Hud made to his people:

“Indeed, I call Allah to witness, and witness yourselves that I am
free from what you associate w ith Allah other than Him , so plot
against me all together and do not give me respite. Indeed, I have
relied upon Allah, m y Lord and your Lord. There is no creature
but that He holds its forelock, indeed m y Lord is on a path that is
straight.” [Hud:54-56]
W hen the Prophet o f Allah knew that his Lord is on a straight path in
his creation and command, reward and punishment, decree, depriving
and giving, giving wellbeing or decreeing calamities, guidance and
misguidance, that is all within the scope o f His Perfect Majesty that befits

454

The Disease A n d The Cure

His Names and Attributes such as justice, wisdom, mercy, benevolence,
virtue, affording the reward and punishment in their rightful place,
affording guidance and misguidance to those who deserve it all in their
most suitable place in a manner that deserves complete praise and
gratitude for that provided him with the necessary knowledge, he called
out in front o f the masses with firm resolve and a heart that had no fear
and was devoted solely to Allah:

“Indeed, I call Allah to w itness, and w itness yourselves that I am
free from w hat you associate w ith Allah other than H im , so plot
against me all together and do not give me respite. Indeed, I have
relied upon Allah, m y Lord and your Lord.” [Hud:56]
Then he informed them o f His M ight and Power over the entire
creation and their subjugation to Him, he said:
“There is no creature but that He holds its forelock,” so how can 1
fear something whose forelock is in the possession o f someone else
within His grasp and under His authority; that would be nothing more
than the highest level o f ignorance and the worst form o f oppression.
Then he informed that Allah is on a straight path in all o f what He
declares and decrees, so a servant should not fear that He will ever
oppress him, and a person should not fear anyone whose forelock is
w ithin His grasp because He is on a straight and correct path. His
judgm ent shall come to pass upon His servants, just is His decree. He
has complete reign over everything and deserves full praise. His decree
over His servants is always just and generous: If He provides, honors,
guides and grants success to an individual, it is from His virtue and

455

The Disease A nd The Cure

mercy; and if He withholds, degrades or misguides, it is from His perfect
justice and wisdom. He is on a straight path in both instances.
The authentic narration mentions: “Nobody has been struck with worry
and sorrow and then says: ‘O Allah I am Y our servant, the son o f Your
servant, my forelock in in You Hand, Your Judgm ent will come to pass
on me, Your decree on me is just. I ask You by all the Names that You
call Yourself, that You have taught to anyone from Your creation, that
You have mentioned in Your Book, or that You have kept unknow n in
the realm o f the unseen. Let the Q u r’an be the jo y o f my heart, the light
o f my chest, the remover o f my sadness and the eradicator o f my
worries,’ except that Allah shall remove their worry and sorrow and
exchange it for happiness .”1 This encompasses the Lord’s universal and
legislative rulings as well as the decreed occurrences that are under the
servants will or those that he has been compelled with, as both shall come
to pass on the servant and both are and fair. This narration has been
extracted from the aforementioned verse and are both closely correlated.

Forbidden Images
W e shall conclude the answer to the initial question with a segment that
is connected to the infatuation o f images and what that contains from
ills in this life and the Hereafter, even though they may be too many to
mention. An infatuation with images corrupts the heart, and if the heart
is corrupted, consequently, the intentions, statements and actions also
become corrupt and the core essence o f monotheism o f an individual
also falls into ruin, as we have previously m entioned and as we shall
further elaborate on shortly inshd A llah (Allah willing). Allah informed
about this condition primarily in two segments o f society, they are the
women and the sodomites. He informed us about the infatuation that
the wife o f al-Aziz had towards Prophet Yusuf and how she attempted
to seduce him and use it against him. He also informed us o f the
condition o f patience, chastity and piety that Prophet Yusuf remained
resolute upon despite the fact that the affair he was trialed with was not
one that a person would not remain patient in, except those whom Allah
grants sufficient patience to. Indeed, the action depends on the strength
o f the incentive and the presence or a lack o f presence o f a prevention.
The incentive here was o f utmost intensity, and this is from a number
o f perspectives:
One: The natural inclination that Allah has created within a man
towards a woman is similar to the one a thirsty person has towards water
and the hungry one towards food. There are even occurrences wherein
many people withhold from food and drink but are unable to withhold
themselves from women. However, this is not something dispraised if it
is done in a lawful manner, in fact, it may be complimented as has been
narrated in the M usnad o f al-Imam Ahmad on the authority o f Yusuf
457

bin ‘Atiya As-Saffar, who narrates from Thabit, who narrates from Anas,
who narrates that the Prophet said: “It has been made beloved to me,
from this worldly life of yours, women and pleasant fragrance, I
withhold from food and drink and I do not withhold from them .”
Second: Prophet Yusuf was a youth, and the urge o f a youth and vigor
is stronger.
Third: He was an unmarried man. He did not have a wife or a concubine
to subdue his urges.
Fourth: He was in a foreign land, whilst the foreigner in any land is
more prone to fulfilling their desires than they are in their homeland
being surrounded by their family and those know n to them.
Fifth: The woman who desired him was someone o f status and beauty
to the extent that any o f these two characteristics would be enough o f a
reason for the action to occur.
Sixth: She was not desisting or refusing. Indeed, many people’s desire
for a woman disappears if the woman herself is refusing or rejecting due
to the humiliation that strikes him from a constant request to be with
her. There are other people whose love and urge intensifies if the
woman rejects the initial proposal, as the poet said:
I increased in lore when she refused — the most beloved thing to a person is
when he is prevented

People’s character differs, some people’s love increases when the
w om an’s desire for the man grows, and it pacifies if the woman is
unwilling. I was also informed by some o f the judges that their urge and
desire pacifies when their wife or concubine is unwilling to the extent
he becomes unwilling to be with her. There are also others whose love
and urge increases when they are deterred, their desire intensifies
whenever they are deterred and attains a pleasure similar to the pleasure

458

The Disease A n d The Cure

felt when he attains hunted prey after it tried to flee and that there is a
pleasure in lawfully attaining something after difficulty and a keen desire
to obtain it.
Seventh: She sought, desired and seduced him and exerted her efforts.
Through this, he was sufficed the burden o f pursuing her and the
submissiveness o f desiring her. Rather, she was the one who pursued and
was subservient, whilst he remained honorable and sought-after.
Eighth: He was in her home and under her control wherein he feared
that she would harm him ifhe did not comply with her requests. Thus,
the incentive o f desire was combined with fear.
Ninth: There was no fear that she or anyone else from her entourage
would expose what happened because it was she w ho was the one who
pursued and desired the act after she had locked the doors and sent the
guards and watchmen away.
Tenth: It appeared to onlookers that he was her slave in the home as he
would enter the home and exit and be present in the home without
objection from others. So there was a sense affability which preceded the
seduction, this is one o f the strongest incentives as was the case with a
particular woman from the nobles o f the Arabs. She was asked: W hat
led you to commit fornication? She replied: “The closeness o f the
cushions and the lengthy period o f intimate discourse.” She meant: The
closeness o f the m an’s pillow to mine, and the long period o f private
conversation between us.
Eleventh: She used the aid o f the leading plotters and conspirators. She
showed him to them and complained o f her condition to them so that
she would use them to her advantage, so Prophet Yusuf sought the aid
o f Allah against them, he said:

Jr? C r ^ 13 0*^1

i-iyij Sf[j

“If You do not avert from me their plan, I m ight incline towards
them and be o f the ignorant.” [Yusuf:33]
Twelfth: She threatened with imprisonment and humiliation. This is a
form o f compulsion, as it is a threat from someone who it would be
thought o f that they are able to execute their threat. Thus, the incentive
for desires and the incentive for freedom and safety became combined
together in an effort to avoid the difficulty o f imprisonment and
humiliation.
Thirteenth: Her husband did not appear to show the jealousy or concern
that was sufficient to separate between them and distance each one from
the other. Rather, the furthest he w ent was to say to Prophet Yusuf
“Leave this off,” and to his wife
Cj5 dill db-’-'J
“Seek forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were from the
w rongdoers,” [Yusuf:29] even though a strong sense of jealousy from
a man is from the strongest preventatives in a situation such as this, but
it was not apparent from him here.
Despite all o f these enticements, he valued the pleasure and fear o f Allah
over all else and was led by his love for Allah to favor the imprisonment
over fornication. He declared:
(»i

ell s-»-I

“My Lord, prison is more to m y lik in g than that w hich they invite
me to.” [Yusuf:33]

460

The Disease A n d The Cure

He also knew that he would not be able to deflect this calamity from
himself and that if His Lord did not save him and divert him from it, he
would have inclined towards them in line with natural human character
and he would have been from the ignorant ones. However, the decisions
he made were from his excellent knowledge o f his Lord and o f himself.
This story contains morals, benefits and wisdoms that exceed one
thousand benefits; perhaps, if Allah grants us success, we shall assign a
separate authorship for them.
The second category o f people who have this form o f infatuation are the
sodomites, as Allah said:

“And the people o f the city came rejoicing. [Lut said] Indeed, these

your life [M uhammad^] indeed they were in their intoxication
w andering blindly.” [al-Hij r:67-72]
Allah has recounted the stories o f both parties and their infatuation of
forbidden images and their lack o f concern for the consequential harms.
This infatuation is an illness that the doctors have failed to find a remedy
for and have found its cure to be difficult. It is -b y Allah- a debilitating
illness, a fatal poison that that proves difficult for the people to remove
once it becomes attached to the heart, and its flame does not ignite in

461

The Disease A n d The Cure

any heart except that it becomes difficult for the people to extinguish. It
is o f different categories.
At times it could reach a level o f unbelief, such as in the case o f someone
who takes the one they are infatuated with as a partner besides Allah,
loving them as they love Allah. W hat would the case be if they loved
their beloved one to a higher level than their love for Allah? This is a
form o f infatuation that is not forgiven [if the person dies in this state]
as it is from the most severe forms o f polytheism, and Allah does not
forgive that partners be associated with Him unless the person makes
repentance during their lifetime.
The mark o f this polytheistic infatuation is that the person who is
affected will place the pleasure o f their beloved one at a higher
precedence than their Lord being pleased with them, and if both their
duty they must perform towards their beloved one and the right o f their
Lord and obedience towards Him conflict, they place their duty towards
their beloved one before the right o f their Lord, value the pleasure o f
their beloved one over pleasing Allah, and such a person will exert their
most precious efforts for their beloved one before exerting any effort if any- for their Lord. He does all he can to draw closer to the one he is
infatuated with and only devote whatever is left o f obedience towards
his beloved one to his Lord, if any.
Reflect on the condition o f most o f those who are infatuated with
images, are they as we have just mentioned? Then, place their situation
on one side o f the scale and their level o f monotheism and faith on the
other, then measure the two weights with a scale that can identify what
pleases Allah and His Messenger and corresponds to fairness and justice.
The case could even be that the infatuated one declares that they have
reached a level o f infatuation that exceeds their oneness o f Allah, as one
wicked individual once said:

462

The Disease A nti The Cure

There are sips that / take with m y month — they are sweeter than T aw hid
(monotheism)

Also, as another wicked individual also said in a line o f poetry, that the
one he has become infatuated with has become more desirable to him
than the Mercy o f his Lord -w e seek refuge in You, O ’ Allah from this
forsaking- he said:
Reaching you is more beloved to m y heart — than the Mercy of the Exalted
Creator

There is not the least doubt that this infatuation is from the most severe
strands o f polytheism.
Many o f the infatuated ones declare that there is no room left in their
hearts for anyone other than the one they are infatuated by at all. The
one he has been trialed with could even have taken a hold o f his entire
heart making the infatuated one a fully subservient slave to the one he is
infatuated by! Such a person has satisfied themselves with the servitude
o f a created being like him, in place o f the honorable servitude to the
Creator, The Exalted and Majestic. This is because servitude and
worship are complete love and submissiveness, whereas this individual
has exerted all his love, submissiveness and humility to the one he is
infatuated with; thus, he has devoted the true essence o f worship to the
one he is infatuated by. Moreover, there is no correlation between this
act and the immoral act [without this level o f infatuation] as one is a
major sin that necessitates particular rulings on the perpetrator, whereas
the evil o f this level o f infatuation has reached the level o f polytheism.
Some o f the mystics say: To be trialed with the immoral deed and these
images is better for me than to be trialed with an infatuation that my
heart becomes servile to other than Allah and preoccupied with other
than Allah.

463

The Disease A n d The Cure

The Detrim ental Effects o f this Infatuation and
the Remedy for It
The remedy to this destructive illness is to firstly recognize the illness
that one has been afflicted with that opposes monotheism, then the
person should perform the inward and outward acts o f worship that busy
their heart from constantly thinking about the infatuation and habitually
seek refuge in Allah and beseech Him in order to divert this from himself
and devote his heart to Him.
This predicament does not have a remedy more beneficial than having
sincerity to Allah. It is the remedy that Allah mentioned in His Book in
the statement:
' T ) .C\ . U

C- '—
jy^'-j dhbd"

“And thus, it was that W e avert from him evil and im m orality.
Indeed, he was o f our sincere servants. [Yusuf:24]
Here, Allah informs us that he is averting any infatuation and immorality
from Prophet Yusuf due to his sincerity. Indeed, if the heart is purely
devoted to Allah and the individual’s actions are sincerely for the sake o f
Allah, the infatuation o f images does not penetrate his heart because they
only penetrate a blank heart, as the poet said:
It encountered a blank heart and settled therein

1 T h e v o w e l o n th e le tte r lam is a kasra as in th e a u th e n tic re cita tio n (s) ascribes to Ibn
K ath ir, Ib n ‘A m r a n d Ibn ‘A m ir.

465

The Disease A n d The Cure

The astute one should know that any sound intellect and the legislation
entail a pursuit o f beneficial things and their further measures to better
them along with a cessation to corruption and an effort to minimize it.
Hence, if two options are presented to a person whereby one is
beneficial and the other is detrimental, two things become incumbent
upon him at this stage: Make a knowledge-based decision and take
action. The knowledge-based decision is through seeking the best
choice from the two options o f benefit and detriment that have been
presented. Once the correct choice becomes clear to an individual, it
becomes incumbent upon him to adhere to it. However, it is common
knowledge that there is no religious or worldly benefit in having an
infatuation o f images. In fact, the detriment far exceeds any possible
benefit manifolds, this can be verified via a number o f perspectives:
One: Being preoccupied with a love and mention o f a created being
from The Lord and remembering Him. Both o f these feelings cannot
find a place in the heart except that one o f them will dominate the person
and take full control and authority.
Second: The torm ent the heart goes through, because whoever loves
something in this manner besides Allah is inevitably torm ented by it:
In the land there isn’t anyone more tormented that a loner — even ij his
desires have a sweet taste
You see him weep in every incident — either from a fear of separation or a
longing desire
He weeps if they are jar, longing jor them — and weeps if they are close,
fearing their departure
His eyes are inflamed [with tears] during departure — and they inflame
when they meet

466

The Disease A n d The Cure

So if a person allows the infatuation to torture them, it becomes from
the harshest torments upon the heart.
Third: The infatuated one is a captive w ithin the grasp o f the one they
are infatuated with, afflicted with degradation. But due to the
intoxication o f infatuation, he does not sense his affliction. Thus, his
heart is like:
A bird in the hand of a child as he torments it — in the midst of disgrace,
whilst the child amuses himself and plays

Therefore, the life o f the infatuated one is one o f a chained captive,
whereas the life o f someone who has not been affected with infatuation
is that o f a captive who has been set free. The infatuated one is as the
poet has mentioned:
Free when you see him, but he is imprisoned — ill as he circles on the verge
o f destruction
Dead in the image o f someone alive and walking — he will come to realize
the resurrection on the D ay of Resurrection

Fourth: It busies a person from things that will benefit them in their
worldly life and afterlife. There is nothing more wasteful to the benefits
o f the worldly life and afterlife than an infatuation to images. As for the
religious benefits on an individual, they depend on the heart’s focus and
devotion to Allah, but an infatuation to pictures is the strongest cause
for the heart’s lack o f focus. As far as the worldly benefits are concerned,
they follow on from the religious affairs. Thus, whoever has neglected
their religious benefits and lost out on them, then their worldly benefits
will be at a further and greater loss.
Fifth: The ills in the worldly life and the Hereafter seize a person who is
infatuated with images faster than a fire consumes that is set on dry
firewood. The reason for this is that the more a heart draws closer to an

467

The Disease A n d The Cure

infatuation and grows in strength towards it, the further is distances itself
from Allah, and so the furthest heart from Allah is the heart that is
infatuated with images. And if the heart becomes distant from Allah, it
is infiltrated by ills from every angle, because the devil gains authority
over it. W hoever is controlled and overpowered by their enemy, he shall
not leave any evil or forsake any harm that he is able to strike you with
except that he does so. So what do you think would be the case with a
heart whose enemy, who is also the most vigilant creature who seeks its
misguidance and destruction, has established himself and has distanced
himself from his protector and the only one who can provide true
happiness, joy and success?
Sixth: If it roots itself in the heart and strengthens its authority, the mind
likewise becomes corrupt and gives rise to satanic whispers. The person
may even be considered amongst the insane, whose minds have been
spoiled to the extent they are unable to make use o f them. News o f such
infatuated people is known through various mediums, rather some o f it
is has even been witnessed.
The most esteemed thing on a person is the mind. Through it, one can
become distinguished from all animals. But if the mind becomes absent,
the person begins to resemble the wild beast and may even be in a worst
state than the animal. Was there anything other than an infatuation that
took the mind o f majnun Layla (the one who was infatuated with Layla)
and his likes?
It may even be so that his level o f insanity surpasses the level o f that o f a
mad person, as has been said:
They say I have gone mad because o f the one I desire, so I said to them —
A n infatuation is more than what the insane suffer from
From infatuation, the person does not awake for a long time — and the
insane one is only enraged for a moment

468

The Disease A n d The Cure

Seventh: It ruins the senses, either ethically or literally. As for the ethical
ruin, it follows on from the destruction o f the heart because the eye, ear
and tongue will be in ruin if the heart is corrupt. Thus, such a person
shall deem the bad that emanates from himself and the one he is
infatuated by as good in correspondence to the narration in the Mustiad
o f al-Imam Ahmad in a narration that is ascribed to the Prophet: “Your
love for something may blind or deafen you.”1 It blinds the core o f the
heart from seeing the faults o f the beloved one, so consequently the eye
does not see them and the ear is deafened from hearing anything o f
reproach, so the hear is unable to hear.
The desire in something conceals its faults, so the one who desires
something will not clearly see its faults until their desire in it ceases, at
which point he will see the faults. The intensity o f desire acts as a veil
over the eye that prevents one from seeing something in its true form.
I desired you when m y eye was behind a veil — but when I could see clearly,
I tore m yself up in blame

Someone who is engrossed into something does not see its faults, and
the one who never came across it will also not see its faults. The only
one who recognizes the faults o f something is someone who was
engrossed in it and then abandoned it. Thus, the Companions who
embraced Islam after they were once unbelievers are more virtuous than
those who were born as Muslims (and all Companions are virtuous).
Umar bin al-Khattab said: “The foundations o f Islam will be undone
piece by piece if there are people w ho are born into Islam w ho do not
recognize the days o f pre-Islamic ignorance.”
As for the corruption that this illness causes the senses, it causes an illness
to the body and withers it, perhaps leading it to full destruction, as it is
1 5/1 9 4 [21694], 6 /4 5 0 [27548]. Also c o llected by A bu D a w u d [5130] a n d al-B ukharT in
A t-T a rik h [2/107]

469

The Disease A n d The Cure

know n from the news o f those whose doom came by way o f severe
infatuation.
A young man whose body became alarmingly thin and slender was
brought before Ibn Abbas whilst on the plain o f Arafat, so he enquired:
W hat is the matter with him? They responded: He suffers from
infatuation. Thereafter, Ibn Abbas would seek refuge in Allah from
being afflicted with infatuation for periods o f the day.
Eighth: Infatuation -as we have previously m entioned- is an excessive
level o f passion whereby the one who is infatuated with becomes the
dominant figure in the heart o f the one who is infatuated until they
become the only thing they imagine, remember or think about without
ever diminishing from his feelings or thoughts. At that point, the soul
begins to exhaust its strength in serving them, this consequently disables
the soul’s strength which results in many ills on the body and the soul
that become difficult or nearly impossible to find a remedy for. This also
results in a change o f personality, actions and objectives that all become
deficient that a person is incapable o f rectifying. It has been said:
Love in its early stages are just whispers — they come and lead him away
Ij the person delves into the whispers o f d esires — then come the major
affairs he cannot handle

The initial stages o f a passionate love may seem easy and sweet, the
middle stage is worrying, preoccupying for the heart and a sickness
whilst the conclusion is danger and death if it is not intervened by the
guidance and protection o f Allah. Some have said:
Live free, infatuation in the beginning is hardship — its middle is sickness
and its end is death

Someone else said:

470

The Disease A n d The Cure

He fueled the infatuation until he became infatuated — when it settled with
him, he could not handle it
H e saw some water and thought it was a wave — when he reached it he
drowned

In addition, the sin is recorded against him, so he has victimized and
wronged himself, so the Arabic proverb fits his description: “You cry
out for help (whilst you are drow ning on a boat) yet it was you who tied
the rope and you who inflated the boat.”

471

The Disease A n d The Cure

Infatuation Has Three Stages
The infatuated one goes through three stages: An initial stage, a middle
stage and the end.
It is incumbent upon him in the initial stage to combat this infatuation
as much as possible if a lawful relationship with the one they love is
unlawful or impossible.
However, if he has passed this stage w ithout success and his heart refuses
to stop traversing towards their beloved one -w hich is the middle stagethen he should suppress it and not expose the one he is infatuated by to
the people, thus combining between a form o f polytheism and
oppression o f another person. This form o f oppression is from the most
severe forms and the most harmful upon the one who is victim to this
infatuation and their family and possessions.
It causes the people to malign the victim and divides their opinion about
the victim between those who believe the story and those who reject it,
and most people will believe any story they are told in this instance based
on the slightest ambiguity. So if it is spread that so and so did something
with a particular person, it may be rejected by one and believed by nine
hundred and ninety-nine!
Also, the news that the infatuated one discloses to the people on this
topic will be received as sound knowledge. It may even be that if the
victim lies and fabricates a story about themselves and narrates it to
someone in agreement with the infatuated persons whims, they may
believe them with unwavering conviction; rather, if they happen to be
in the same place at the same time, people may become convinced that
is was a premeditated and agreed meeting.
473

The Disease A nd The Cure

Yet their conviction in this matter is merely based on suspicion,
imagination, ambiguities, delusions and false news, which to them seems
as strong as their conviction in the tangible and real affairs. It is due to
such measures that the accusers o f the pure and chaste one, the beloved
one to the Messenger o f Allah^ who was exonerated from above the
seven heavens was falsely accused o f immorality due to the ambiguity of
her and Safwan bin al-M u’atal following the initial group on their
expedition.
Had Allah not decreed her innocence, defended her honor and rendered
her accusers claim futile, events may have been other than how they
unfolded. The intent here is to highlight that if the infatuated one
exposes their love for someone who they are not able to have a legitimate
relationship with, it counts as an injustice, harm and transgression
against the victim and their family and an opportunity for many people
to affirm their suspicions about them.
Moreover, if someone who inclines to him - either willingly or out of
fear - aids him, the oppression spreads and the intermediary individual
becomes an oppressive individual who has no concern for the honor o f
a woman. If the Prophet has supplication for a curse upon the one who
is an intermediary and is instrumental in the deal between a briber and
the bribed in completing the transaction, how serious do you think the
case would be with regards to the one who acts as an intermediary
between the infatuated one and their beloved one in an unlawful
relationship?!
Here, both the infatuated one and their accomplice aid one another in
oppressing the one who is subject to this infatuation and the oppressing
o f others in their possessions and honor and family w ho may be obstacles
in the path towards their objective. O n many occasions, attaining the
objective could depend on assassinating a soul that stands in the way o f

474

The Disease A n d The Cure

their aim. How numerous are the murder victims whose blood has been
spilt for this reason, whether they are a spouse or a master or a relative!
And how many women have been beguiled and corrupted against their
husbands, or servants against their masters! Bearing in mind that the
Prophet cursed the one who perpetrates such an act, frees himself from
them and declares it to be from the major and destructive sins.
Since the Prophet has forbidden us from as much as proposing to a
woman for marriage whilst someone else is in a marriage proposal with
her, or out haggling and undercutting his brother in a business
transaction, what do you think the severity o f exerting effort to separate
a husband from his wife or a servant from their master would be?! Yet
those who are infatuated with images along with their accomplices do
not even see that as a sin.
If the infatuated one seeks to reach the one they are infatuated by and
also has their own spouse, the matter becomes worse in that it now
includes a form o f injustice to others that is equal if not more than the
sin o f lewdness itself.
Simply repenting from such an immoral act does not return the right of
a person to them or fulfill it. Even if the repentance fulfills the right o f
Allah, the right o f the oppressed one still remains unattended to, and the
oppressed shall have a right to seek their rights from those who
oppressed them on the Day o f Resurrection. The oppression towards a
parent is to corrupt their child and those who are more dear to them
than their own selves, and the oppression towards a husband is to corrupt
their wife, and the offence with the one they share a bed with is worse
than oppressing them by taking all their wealth. This is more harmful to
him than stealing all o f his wealth. How atrocious is it as a sin that is
more severe than the immoral deed itself.

47 5

The Disease A nd The Cure

It is from the rights o f the one who leaves on an expedition for the sake
o f Allah who has this form o f oppression committed against him to stand
before the oppressor on the Day o f Resurrection and it will be said to
him: “Take whatever you wish from his good deeds,” as the Prophet
said. Then the Prophet said: “W hat are your thoughts ?”1 i.e., what do
you think he will leave from the perpetrator’s good deeds?
Furthermore, if this crime is combined with the fact that the oppressed
individual is a neighbor or a near relative, the oppression takes on a more
serious form in that it includes a cutting o f kinship or harm towards a
neighbor. “None who cuts ties o f kinship shall enter Paradise”2 and “He
will not enter Paradise, he whose neighbor is not secure from his
wrongful conduct.”'
If the infatuated person seeks the aid o f the devils and evil spirits in
reaching his objective, either through sorcery or the like, he has
combined polytheism and oppression with the unbelief o f magic. Even
if he does not directly carry out the magic, he has approved o f the
unbelief in order to attain his objective, whilst this is not something
completely alien to unbelief itself. In any case, any form o f assistance in
this regard is considered assistance in disobedience and transgression.
There are additional forms o f far-reaching and harmful forms o f
oppression associated with the infatuated one attaining their objectives
that are well known. If he attains the objective, there would also be
further aims that he would be working towards and would require the

help o f his beloved one in obtaining them. Thus, both end up aiding
one another in sin and transgression. O ne would aid the infatuated one
in being the reason for oppression against their family, relatives, master
or spouse and the infatuated one would be aiding one another in
oppressing whoever they have to in order to attain their goal. Each one
assists the other for their own gains that contain the oppression o f others.
Therefore, transgression and sin against the people happens due to their
evil and oppressive cooperation, as has been the habitual case throughout
history to the extent that some o f them may endeavor to seek a position
for the other that they are not w orthy o f or gain some wealth that they
are undeserving o f or exceed their boundaries with others. If their
beloved one disputes with someone or complains about another
individual, he would never hold a position against him, whether they
are the oppressed or the oppressor. In addition to the oppression that
emanates from the infatuated one towards the people from the various
forms o f ploys he employs to take the wealth o f others or reach their
beloved one through theft, force, betrayal or fake testimony or the likes.
It could even reach the stage o f murder in order to obtain the necessary
wealth that will allow them to reach the one they are infatuated by.
All o f these ills and many more originate from an infatuation to unlawful
images that could possibly even lead a person to unbelief. Numbers o f
individuals who were raised and nurtured upon Islam have actually
become Christians due to an infatuation. Similar to the story o f the man
who would raise the call to the five daily prayers whose eyes became set
on a Christian lady one day when he climbed the minaret to make the
call to prayer. He became fond o f her at first glance, so he descended
and approached her and asked that she be his. She said that she is a
Christian, so if you accept my religion, I shall marry you, so he did so.
However, that day he climbed a set o f stairs in her home, fell off the steps
and died.

There was a time wherein if the Christians wished to make their captives
accept their religion they would show them a beautiful woman and
request that she seduce the captive, so that once his love for her is rooted
in his heart, she offers herself to him if he enters her religion.
At which point:

“Allah keeps firm those w ho believe w ith the firm word in the
worldly life and the Hereafter. And Allah sends astray the
wrongdoers, and Allah does what He w ills.” [lbrahim:27]
Yet each side in such an unlawful relationship o f infatuation has
wronged the other. Each one has oppressed themselves and the other,
and their oppression transcends onto others, as previously mentioned.
The most severe form o f oppression above all is their polytheism that
they commit, as this form o f unlawful infatuation consists o f every form
o f injustice.
If the one who the infatuated person is in love with does not fear Allah,
he or she could expose the infatuated one to destruction, and it is
undoubtedly an injustice to further entice the infatuated one or beautify
themselves for him or tempt him from every path until he gains his
wealth and uses him to their advantage without allowing him to
approach them so that he does not fulfill his need; hence, he torments
him to his advantage. The infatuated one could go as far as murdering
the one he is infatuated with. How many victims have been taken from
both sides! How numerous are the blessings that have disappeared, how
many have found themselves in poverty after richness, how low have
people gone and how much has it destroyed unity! H ow numerous are
the families that have been destroyed due to this, because if a woman
478

The Disease A n d The Cure

notices that her husband is interested in someone else, she will also
become interested in someone else. Thus, a man in this state will be at a
loss between ruining his own household and remaining stable. Some
people value the first and others value the second option.
A person should never allow the love o f unlawful images to become
ingrained in their feelings so that it does not lead him to any o f these
evil affairs. W hoever does so has neglected and deluded themselves, and
he falls into ruin, he would have done it to himself. Had it not been for
the constant staring at the one he is infatuated with and a desire to be
with her, such an infatuation would not have taken hold o f the heart in
such a way, since the first step to infatuation is to have an admiration,
whether it be through seeing or hearing.
However, if there is no covetousness in reaching this person and this is
associated with the hopelessness o f ever being with the person,
infatuation does not arise. Also, if the individual is covetous in reaching
their goal, but their thoughts divert them from such feelings and the
heart does not become preoccupied with it, infatuation will not occur.
But if he continues to think about the beauty o f the one he is infatuated
by coupled with a fear o f something greater than attaining his objective,
such as his fear o f entering the Hellfire, the wrath o f Allah and the
accumulation o f sins whilst this feeling outweighs the eagerness and
thoughts towards the one he loves, similarly, infatuation does not occur.
However, if he is devoid o f this fear and replaces it with a fear of
something worldly, such as a fear o f self-destruction or loss o f wealth or
a fall in status amongst the people or those whom he respects, and this
fear exceeds the factors o f infatuation, it may repel it. Likewise, if he
fears to lose a person who is more beloved to him that the one he is
infatuated with and places the love o f this person before the love o f the
one he is infatuated with, it can also be repelled.

However, if all o f the above is nonexistent or the infatuation is too
strong, the heart will become completely captivated and the soul shall
become heavily inclined.

A W ro n g Claim: “There Are Benefits to Being
Infatuated’
If it is ever said: You have m entioned the ills, harms and blights o f
infatuation, if only you would m ention the advantages and benefits now
that include a softness in character, soothing o f the soul, relaxation,
noble manners - such as courage, generosity, magnanimity and a
softness towards acquaintances and a kindness.
It was said to Yahya bin M u’ath Ar-Razi: “Your son has become
infatuated with so and so, he replied: ‘All praise is due to Allah W ho led
him to the natural feelings o f a m an.’”
Others have stated: “Infatuation is an illness o f the heart for the noble
ones.”
Others have also stated: “Infatuation only happens to those o f apparent
upright moral character and pure manners, or to someone who possesses
a virtuous tongue and excellent benevolence, or to someone o f
distinguished behavior or esteemed lineage.”
Others have said: “Infatuation breeds bravery into the coward, filters the
mind o f the unintelligent, loosens the hand o f the miserly honors the
slave and settles any erratic behavior. It is the acquaintance for those who
are lonely and the companion for those who do not have any company.”
They go on to say that infatuation relaxes the soul and tends to one’s
manners, and that it is normal to express it but concealing it is
burdensome.

Someone else said: “W hoever does not find joy in their soul from the
tender voice or the radiant face has a corrupt disposition in need of
healing.” He wrote some words o f poetry on this topic:

and the camel on the desert plain are the same

Another one said:
If you are not infatuated and you do not know what a desire is — then you
(might as well be) are a stone on the side o f a solid rock

Another one said:

and feed on straw, because you are a donkey

Another one said:
If you are not infatuated and you do not know what a desire is — then you
have not experienced any o f the pleasantries o f this life

It was said to some o f the infatuated ones who remained chaste: W hat
would you do if you came across the person you were infatuated with?
He replied: I would pleasure my feelings by looking a them, relax my
heart by mentioning them and speaking to them, conceal whatever they
would not like to be exposed and not undo our pact through what they
dislike.
Ishaq bin Ibrahim 1 said: “The souls o f the infatuated ones are pure and

Some Stories o f Those W ho Have Fallen Victim
to Infatuation
Here is the story o f Abu Bakr M uhammad bin Dawud Ath-Thahiri, the
w ell-know n scholar in the sciences o f jurisprudence, Hadith, Q u r’an
exegesis and literature, who also has a school o f thought in Islamic
jurisprudence and is from the major scholars. Yet his infatuation was
well known.
Niftawayh said: “I visited him in his final illness before he passed away,
so I said to him: ‘How are you?’ He replied: ‘In love with the one who
has led me to what you see now .’ So I said to him: ‘W hat stops you from
being with them lawfully?’ He replied: ‘G aining pleasure is two types:
O ne is the permissible look and the other is the impermissible pleasure.
It is the permissible look that led me to what you see now. As for the
impermissible pleasure, I have been prohibited from it from what I have
been informed by my father w ho said, ‘I was informed by Suwayd bin
Sa id, who said I was informed by Ali bin M us-hir on the authority o f
Abu Yahya al-Q attat who narrates from Mujahid who narrates from Ibn
Abbas in a narration that is ascribed to the Prophet: ‘W hoever becomes
infatuated and conceals their love, is chaste and is patient, Allah shall
forgive him and admit him into Paradise.’”

The U pperm ost Happiness and the Bliss o f the
Heart
Here is a mightily significant issue that any intelligent person should pay
attention to. It is that the complete pleasure, jo y and happiness and bliss
w ithin the heart along with the elation o f the soul depends on two
things:
The first: The level o f love and beauty the beloved one holds within the
soul o f the individual, and that the beloved one becomes more beloved
to him than anything else.
The second: The level o f this love, the devotion o f one’s capabilities in
loving Him whilst preferring a nearness to Him and meeting Him over
all else.
Intellectual people will understand that the level o f pleasure that is
achieved after attaining their beloved objective depends on the initial
strength o f the love itself. Thus, the stronger the love, the stronger and
more complete the pleasure attained. The pleasure that someone w ho is
suffering from severe thirst once he obtained fresh water and the one
w ho feels sever hunger once he obtains delicious food and the like
depends on the yearning, need and love for such things.
O nce this is known, it also becomes subsequently know n that this
pleasure, happiness and jo y is something sought after by the soul, in fact,
it is the objective o f every living person. Since this is the case, it becomes
something dispraise worthy if it is o f the kind that results in a greater
pain or prevents someone from attaining a pleasure that is better and
more noble than it. So how would it be if it results in the greatest regret

487

The Disease A n d The Cure

and causes the greatest luxuries and joys to be squandered? Yet it is
praised if it aids a person to achieve the ultimate pleasure that is
unspoiled, which is the pleasure that is experienced in the hereafter and
the bliss and pleasant life one experiences within it.

And Allah is better and more enduring.” [Ta Ha:72-73]
Allah created this creation to allow them to taste this permanent pleasure
in the eternal abode. As for this worldly life, it will come to an end and
its pleasures will never be absolutely pure nor will they last forever, as
opposed to the afterlife because its pleasures are everlasting, its bliss is
absolute and pure o f any hardship or pain, in it lies all that the souls desire
and the eyes find delight in as well as it being an eternal abode. And no
soul truly knows what Allah has concealed for His servants from the
blissful sights. In fact, this abode o f Paradise contains what no eye has
ever seen, nor what any ear has heard nor what any heart has ever felt.

This was the intended m eaning o f that sincere advisor to his people
wherein he said:

“O m y people, follow m e, I w ill guide you to the w ay o f right
conduct. O m y people, this w orldly life is on ly temporary
enjoym ent, and indeed, the hereafter - that is the hom e o f
permanent settlem ent.” [Ghafir:38-39]
Hence, he declared to them that this life is used as a tool to seek the
pleasure o f the Afterlife and that the afterlife is the permanent settlement.
Once someone realizes that the luxuries o f this life are merely a
temporary enjoyment and a means to the pleasures o f the afterlife and
that this is the very reason that this world was created for, then it
becomes clear that any pleasure that aids and facilitates towards the
ultimate pleasure in the Hereafter is not to be dispraised if it is obtained;
rather it should be welcomed according to its effectiveness in
connecting the person to the delights o f the Hereafter.

A Response to the Claim
The response to this claim is as follows -an d Allah is the O ne W ho
grants success. Com m enting on this topic must be done so with
distinction between what is permissible, beneficial and harmful. It
cannot be loosely deemed as dispraiseworthy or rejected or praised or
accepted. Its ruling and complete affair can only be revealed once we
define what it is restricted to; however, this form o f love in itself is not
praised or dispraised in an absolute manner. Here we shall m ention the
beneficial, harmful, permissible and impermissible forms o f this level o f
love.
O ne must know that the most beneficial, obligatory, highest and most
noble type o f love is the type that is directed to the O ne W ho the hearts
have been created to love and the natural inclination o f the creation has
a predisposition to worship alone. It is the reason for the creation o f the
heavens and the earth and the natural disposition o f every creature. It is
the subtle secret within the testimony that there is no deity w orthy o f
worship except Allah, as the word (deity) refers to the one who the hearts
devote their worship to through love, glorification, humility and
servitude; thus, worshiping the deity.
However, worship is never correct unless it is devoted to Allah alone, as
(worship) is the complete devotion o f love along with complete
servitude and humility. Polytheism in this act o f worship is from the
most severe forms o f injustice that Allah does not forgive (if a person
does not repent from it in their lifetime). Allah The Most High is loved
for His Essence, whereas anyone else is to be loved for His sake. Every
revealed Book or Scripture, call o f a Messenger, natural disposition o f
His creation, the sound intellect He has afforded them and the
491

The Disease A n d The Cure

innumerable blessings He has provided them with all indicate the
obligation o f loving Allah. This is because the hearts are naturally
inclined and created to love the one w ho blesses them and is benevolent
to them. So how about the O ne W ho provides all benevolence and every
blessing that touches His creation is from Him alone w ithout any
partner, as Allah says:

“And whatever you have o f favor, it is from Allah. T hen w hen
adversity touches you, to H im you cry for help.” [An-Nahl:53]
This is all an indication, along with the knowledge o f His Perfect Names
and Attributes and the evidence that is clear within His perfect creation
and Majesty and M ight over all things.
There are two causes that bring about the emotion o f love: O ne is
beauty and the other is benevolence, and The Lord possesses absolute
perfection in both o f them. He is beautiful and loves beauty. In fact, He
possesses perfect beauty. Thus, there is no one else w ho is loved for their
essence except Him. Allah says:

The origin o f alliance is love, it cannot be achieved w ithout love. Just as
the origin for enmity is hatred. Allah is the ally o f the believers and they
are allied to Him, they have this allegiance to Him due to their love for
Him and He also is their ally since He loves them. Therefore, Allah is an
ally to His servants according to their love for Him. Hence, he has
rebuked those who take allies besides Him, as opposed to those who love
His allies as they have not taken partners besides Him, rather, their love
for the allies o f Allah is part o f their excellence in the alliance to Allah.
He has also rebuked the one who equates the love they have for Him
with others and informed us that whoever does this has taken that object
as a partners besides Him, loving this partner as they love Allah, but those

who believe are stronger in love for Allah. He has also informed us that
those who perpetrated such an act o f equating between Allah and others

“By Allah, we were indeed in manifest error, w hen w e equated

Due to this monotheism and singling Allah in this form o f love in
worship, Allah sent forth the messengers, revealed all the divine Books,
encompasses the message o f every messenger and created the heavens
and the earth. He set paradise for those who actualize this form o f
worship and the hellfire for the polytheists w ho associate partners with
Him.
The Prophet has sworn that none shall truly attain the highest point o f
faith (until I become more beloved to them than their child, parent and
all o f the people)1. So what about the love o f The Lord Mighty and
Majestic?!
The Prophet also said to Umar bin al-Khattab [regarding attaining
complete faith]: “N o Umar, until I am more beloved to you than your
ow n self.” O ne shall not attain a complete level o f faith until their love
for the Prophet reaches such a level. Since the Prophet is more worthy
o f the believers than themselves in having love for, so is the Lord o f all
creation, M ighty and Majestic W ho possesses the perfect Names and
Attributes W ho there is none w orthy o f worship besides Him more
deserving o f love than their ow n selves?

Everything that Allah grants His believing servants calls them to devote
the act o f worship o f love to H im w hether it is something that the
servant is pleased with or otherwise. Therefore, when Allah gives or
denies, grants well-being or calamity, constricts or eases, His justice or
benevolence, causes death or gives life, bestows kindness, mercy or
benevolence, conceals faults and pardons, shows patience and
forbearance in dealing with His servants, responding to a persons
supplications, reliving someone o f difficulties, rescuing an individual
from severe constraint, easing hardships - w ithout a single need for
Himself to do so, in fact, He does all this whilst being independent and
completely self-sufficient in every aspect. All o f which draw the hearts
to worship Him alone and devote the worship o f love to Him alone.
Rather, the physical allowance that He affords His servants when the
servants chooses to disobey Him, concealing him at the m om ent o f
disobedience until the individual has satisfied themselves with sin under
His watchful Sight whilst the individual uses the assistance o f the
bounties His Lord has provided him with in the act, all o f which is from
the most powerful driving motives to love Him alone. Surely, if a
member from the creation treated another person with the smallest
example o f this, he would not be able to withhold his ow n heart from
loving that person, so how can someone not love the O ne W ho
consistently bestows benevolence to them as often as breaths are taken,
despite the individual’s wrongdoing?
His goodness always showers the creation even though the servant
presents sins, Allah grants them all the means to love H im by affording
the creation His favors whilst He is not in need o f their actions, yet the
servants presents sins even though he is in dire need o f Allah! Hence, he
failed to deter himself from disobedience in light o f Allah’s benevolence
and bounties that He bestowed on him, yet the servant’s disobedience
and treachery did not sever the benevolence o f his Lord to him!

495

The Disease A n d The Cure

Treachery diverts the heart from loving someone who holds such a
characteristic and connects it with someone else.
Additionally, anyone o f the creation w hom you may love or loves you
in return does so for their own benefit or an interest, but Allah calls you
to love Him for your own benefit as has been mentioned in the Q udsi
narration: “My servants, each w ant each other for themselves, but I call
you for yourselves.” Thus, how can one not feel ashamed that his Lord
is o f this perfect and lofty status whilst they turn away from Him, busied
by a love for someone else whose heart has become engrossed with the
love o f someone besides Him?
Additionally, there are those amongst the creation that will not interact
with you if they cannot profit from you, and there must be a benefit for
them in the interaction. However, you Lord deals with you so that you
may obtain the highest and mightiest form o f profit. The action is
equivalent to ten o f its kind in deeds and can be multiplied up to seven
hundred times and much more, whereas the evil deed is only equivalent
to itself and can be swiftly erased. He created you to serve Him and
created everything else in the worldly life and the hereafter for you.
So who then can be more deserving o f devoting our full capabilities and
exerting our efforts in pleasing? Also, the demands and needs o f the
entire creation are within His scope, He is the most generous and the
most giving who gives His servants their needs before they ask and in a
manner that far exceeds their expectations. He is grateful for the little
that someone may put forth from actions and makes it develop and
prosper whilst He forgives much o f the mishaps that occur from the
people and erases it.

“W hoever is in the heavens and the earth asks H im , everyday He
is bringing about a m atter.” [Ar-Rahman:29]
He is not distracted by the many voices or sounds, nor is He mistaken
due to the numerous demands o f the creation or becomes uneasy due to
the persistent invocations o f those who consistently ask, rather He
becomes pleased at this level o f insistent supplication. He loves to be
invoked and becomes angered if they creation abandon asking Him. He
is shy at particular times from His servants wherein they do not have
shyness before Him, He conceals their faults at times they wish to reveal
their ills and has mercy on them at times they do not have mercy on
themselves. He attracts them through His blessings and benevolence to
His honor and pleasure, yet they refuse. He then sent His Messengers
for this task along with sent along with them the covenant. Then He
descends Himself (during the last third o f every night) and said: “W ho
will ask Me so that I can give him what he asked for? W ho will ask for
My forgiveness so 1 may forgive them?”
As the poet m entioned in this regard:
I call you to connect, but you refuse — I send m y messenger for the cause
I descend to you myself — I find you amongst those who are asleep

H ow can the hearts not love the one w ho solely brings good, the one
w ho solely eradicates the bad deeds, responds to the supplications, wipes
away the faults, forgives the sins, conceals the blemishes, relieves from
difficulties, rescues from hardships and fulfills the wants? Thus, He is
“The most deserving o f remembrance, the most deserving o f our
gratitude, the only one deserving o f worship, the most deserving o f
praise, the best in assistance, the most compassionate o f all w ho reign,
the most generous o f all those w ho have been asked, the most giving o f

497

The Disease A n d The Cure

anyone who ever gave, the most merciful o f anyone w ho has been asked
for mercy and the most noble o f all those w ho have been intended.”
He is the most honorable o f all those that have been turned to and
sufficient is He for the one w ho relies on Him. He is more merciful to
His creation than a mother is to her child, He is more pleased with the
repentance o f His servants than the one w ho lost their riding beast in
the barren desert with all o f his provisions on it having despaired o f life,
then found it all in front o f him.
He is the sovereign King w ithout any partners, alone w ithout any equal.
All must perish except Him. He is not obeyed w ithout His permission
and not disobeyed w ithout His knowledge. W hen He is obeyed, He
bestows gratitude even though it is only through His guidance and
blessings that one can do so. He is disobeyed, yet He forgives and
pardons even though it is His right that the creature has fallen short in.
He is the closest witness and the most exalted protector. He is the most
loyal and just. He protected the person from their ow n soul, took by
their forelocks, prescribed every occurrence and determined the time
spans o f every life. So the hearts incline to Him and all secrets are open
to Him. The unseen is always unveiled to Him and every creature has a
yearning and dire need for Him.
All the faces will be humbled before the light o f His Face whilst the
hearts are unable to truly and fully comprehend His true essence, and
the natural inclination o f man along with every possible evidence proves
that it is impossible for Him to be o f resemblance to anything or anyone.
The darkness becomes light from the light o f His Face illuminating the
heavens and the earth. The Prophet said: “He does not sleep, and it does
not befit Him to sleep. He lowers the scales and raises them. The deed
done in the night is raised to Him before the day, and the deed o f the
day is raised to Him before the night. His Veil is light, and if He were

The Greatest and U ndisputed Blessing in the
Hereafter
Once the above is acknowledged, it must also be know n that the greatest
blessing and pleasure in the Hereafter is to gaze at the Face o f The Lord
Mighty and Majestic, to hear His Speech from Him directly and to be
near Him, as it has been authentically reported in the Saluh o f Muslim:
“By Allah, He has not given them anything more beloved to them than
to look at H im .”1
In another narration: “Certainly if He appears before them and they see
Him, they will forget the other blessings they have been bestowed .”2
Also collected by An-Nasa7! and al-Imam Ahmad on the authority o f

“I ask you to afford me the pleasure o f gazing at your Face and the
yearning desire to meet You.”
Also, in the book entitled al-Sunnah by Abdullah ibn al-Imam Ahmad

H ow Does a Person Attain This Ultimate
Pleasure?
Once the above has been established, it must also be know n that the
most powerful means to attain this pleasure is through actualizing the
greatest pleasure that can be experienced in this worldly life, which is
the pleasure o f know ing Allah and the pleasure o f loving Him. That is
the paradise and uppermost blessing o f this worldly life, and the other
pleasures in the life besides it are only like a sprinkle o f water on the
ocean in comparison, as the soul and the heart were only created for that
sole purpose.
The most pleasant part o f this worldly life is know ing and loving Allah,
and the most pleasant part o f the Paradise in the Hereafter is seeing Allah
and being a witness to that blessing. Loving and know ing Allah is the
delight o f the eyes, the enjoyment o f the soul, the jo y o f the heart and
the ultimate blessing and bliss o f this worldly life. In fact, the temporary
pleasures o f this life which disconnect a person from that great pleasure
will become a source o f pain and torm ent for them, and that individual
will remain in an impoverished life as the pleasant life can only be with
and by Allah.
Some o f the people who actually felt this pleasure in this life would
experience moments in their lives w hen they would exclaim: “If the
people o f Paradise experience a similar condition to ours, they are
undoubtedly in a pleasant life!”
Others have said: “If the kings and the offspring o f the kings knew the
feelings we experience, they would have fought us for it with their
swords.”

If this is the case with the above form o f illegitimate love, what value are
we to have for the type o f love that is the life o f the hearts and
nourishment to the soul that the heart cannot find any pleasure, bliss,
success or life without. If the heart becomes void o f it, a person’s pain
intensifies through the eye that loses its insight, the ear that loses its true
sense o f hearing, the nose that loses its true sense o f smell and the tongue
that begins to speak inappropriately. Moreover, the corruption o f the
heart if it loses the love for the Creator and Sustainer and the O ne who
solely deserves to be worshipped is more o f a detrimental loss than the
body losing its soul. However, this is a matter that can only be truly
comprehended and believed by the one who possesses the true essence
o f life w ithin them, as the wound does not cause pain to the dead!

The intent behind this is to establish that the greatest pleasures o f this

The Pleasures o f the W orldly Life Are Three
(Generic) Types
The most paramount and complete one o f them is whatever links the
creation to the pleasure o f the Hereafter. The believer is rewarded for
whatever good he does, as long as the intention is for the sake o f Allah
whether it be consumption o f food and drink, clothing, intimacy with
a spouse or subduing the enemy o f Allah and his own enemy (Satan). So
imagine the reward for the belief and knowledge o f Allah, loving Him
as He should be loved, longing to meet Him and yearning to see His
Noble Face in the eternal abode o f bliss.
The second type: A pleasure that denies from the pleasure o f the
Hereafter and results in a greater pain, such as the illegitimate pleasure
o f those who worship idols besides Allah with a bond o f affection
between them in the worldly life, they love them as they should love
Allah taking advantage o f each other, as they shall declare in the
Hereafter when they meet their Lord:

This is in addition to the forbidden pleasures o f unlawful lewdness,
oppression, tyranny on the earth or exaltedness w ithout due right. In
reality, these forbidden pleasures are a progressive allurement from Allah
to those whom rightfully deserve it in order to afford them the sternest
torm ent and deny them, through their own actions, the ultimate
pleasure. It is a similitude equivalent to someone who serves a delicious
dish that has been poisoned in order to allure them to their destruction.

Allah said: “W e w ill progressively lead them from where they do
not k n o w .” [al-A raf: 182-183]
Some o f the scholars o f the Pious Predecessors would say in explanation
to this verse: ‘It means that on every occasion they perpetrate a sin, we
produce an indulgence for them .’

H e also m entioned in their regard:

“So let not their w ealth or their children impress you. Allah only
intends to punish them through them in this worldly life and that
their souls should depart [at death] w hile they are disbelievers.”
[At-Tawbah:55]
Such indulgences will only conclude as sources o f the strongest pains, as
the poet wrote:
Things in this life that were delightful for some — became torment in the
hereafter

The third type: The love towards the Messenger o f Allah
I mean the
exclusive love towards him by this. It is the love that occupies the heart,
thoughts and mention with the one they love. Hence, every Muslim has
love for Allah and His Messenger within their heart, and none can
embrace the religion o f Islam w ithout this; however, the people vary in
degree o f their love along a vast scope that only Allah can truly know.
This is the type o f love that relieves the soul, lightens the burdens and
duties, makes the miserly generous, emboldens the coward, cleanses the
mind, disciplines the inner-self, improves the standard o f life to its true
reality, and it is not the type o f love and infatuation one may have
towards forbidden images. Thus, when the innermost secrets are
uncovered on the Day o f Judgm ent, such an individual shall have the
purest amongst all the servants. As the poet mentioned:
W ithin your heart will remain — an inner feeling o f love on the day the
secrets are revealed

It is the type o f love that illuminates the face, relaxes and expands the

The Love for the Speech o f Allah
Similarly, the love for the speech o f Allah is a sign that indicates the love
for Allah. If you ever wish to identify the level o f love you or anyone
else holds towards Allah, then ascertain the love you have in your heart
for the Q ur’an and whether the pleasure you gain from listening to the
Q ur’an is greater than the pleasure gained by those who listen to songs
and musical instruments. It is well known that whoever loves someone
will also love to hear their speech and address. As has been mentioned:
// you claim to love me — then why have you abandoned m y booh
Have you not considered what it contains — from the delights of m y speech?

Uthman bin ‘Affan -Allah be pleased with him - mentioned: “If our
hearts were pure, we would never become tired o f the speech o f Allah.”
How can one ever have enough o f the speech o f the O ne they love
whilst He is also the One he ultimately seeks to please.
The Prophet said to Ibn Mas ud one day: “Recite to me.” Ibn M asud
replied: “Recite to you, whilst it is you who receives this revelation?” He
said: “I love to hear it from others.” So Ibn Mas ud began to recite from
the chapter A n -N is a ’ until he reached the verse:

“So how will it be w hen W e bring from every nation a witness
and W e bring you [O M uhammad^] against these people as a
w itness.” [A n-N isa’:4l]

511

The Disease A n d The Cure

Ibn Mas ud said: At that point, the Prophet said: “Do not recite any
further,” then he raised his head and I saw that tears were streaming
along his face from the crying .1
Additionally, if the Companions were to gather alongside Abu Musa
being amongst them, they would say: “Abu Musa, remind us o f our
Lord,” so he would recite whilst they listen.
Those who love the Q u r’an find a pleasure, delight, sweetness and joy
that far exceeds whatever those who listen to the music will ever find. If
you come across someone who finds delight and excitement in listening
to poetry or music over the Q u r’an, it is as the poet said:
The Q u r’an is read to you — yet you are unmoved lihe a rock
But a line from poetry is recited to you — and you swerve to it like a drunk

It is from the strongest signs that such a person’s heart is void or deficient
o f the love for Allah and His speech and connected to the satanic tunes,
whilst the deluded one will believe that they are traversing the correct
path. Hence, the love towards Allah, His speech and His Messenger is
far greater than what the claimant has falsely mentioned regarding the
benefits o f infatuation. In fact, there is not a form o f love that is more
beneficial than it, and any other love other than it is w rong unless it aids
in this cause or implants a desire for it.

The Love o f W om en
As for the love o f women, one cannot be censured for it. Rather, it is
from the excellence o f man. Allah bestowed a favor on His servants as
mentioned in His statement:

“And from His signs is that He created for you from yourselves
mates that you may find tranquility in them , and He placed
betw een you affection and mercy. Indeed, in that are signs for a
people w ho give thou ght.” [Ar-Rum:2l]
He made the woman a source o f tranquility for the man whereby his
heart settles for her, then placed pure love between them, which is a type
o f love that is merged with mercy. After m entioning the lawful and
unlawful measures as it relates to women in the Q u r’an, Allah then
mentioned:

“If one gazes at a woman, he will not be able to withhold himself.”

Zainab, and was intimate with her, then he said:
“Indeed a woman may approach in a devilish manner, and wander off
in a devilish manner. So if any o f you see a woman and are impressed
by her, he should return to his spouse as that will repel whatever desire
has arisen in himself.”1

Likewise, the command to remedy this feeling o f excitement that has

with your own spouse as it will quell the urge. It is also the guidance
found in the narration collected in Suiian Ibn Majah': “N othing is like
marriage for the two who love each other.” Marrying someone whom
you are passionately in love with is the cure to this infatuation, and it is
the remedy that Allah has legislatively decreed and otherwise.

The Story o f Zainab bint Jahsh -M ay Allah Be
Pleased W ith H er
As for the story o f Zainab bint Jahsh -m ay Allah be pleased with her- it
was the case that Zayd made the decision to divorce her, but she was
unwilling. He would consult the Prophet in this matter, but he would
advise him to remain with her. After some time, it became evident to
the Messenger o f AllahsS that Zayd would inevitably separate from her,
so he thought to marry her if Zayd were to divorce her, but also became
uneasy that the people would spread that he married the woman who
was married to a son he previously adopted, as he had adopted Zayd
before Prophet-hood. However, the Lord o f creation has decreed a
legislation that is comprehensive for the benefits o f all creation. So when
Zayd divorced her and her waiting period had ended, he called her
behind the door and said: “Zaynab, the Messenger o f Allah^ would like
to marry you.” She replied: “I will not proceed with anything until 1
seek guidance from my Lord.” She then w ent to her place o f prayer and
performed the prayer. Allah authorized her marriage with the Messenger
o f Allah^ and set the contract from above His Throne, and the verse
was also revealed accordingly:

Thereafter, the Messenger o f A llah^ consummated the marriage. She
would hold it as an honor over the other wives o f the Prophet by saying:

“You were all married off by your families, but 1 was married off by

This is the story o f the Messenger o f Allah^ with Zainab.
There is no doubt that women were beloved (in a lawful manner) to the
Prophet, as the narration in Saliih al-Bukhari states on the authority of
Anas who cites that the Messenger o f Allah^ said: “From the affairs of
this world o f yours I have been made fond o f [are] women, pleasant
fragrances, and the prayer has been made a sweetness to my eye .”1 This
is the exact wording o f the narration, not as others have narrated: “I have
been made fond o f three things in this w o rld ...” The Jews envied him
for this and exclaimed: “He has no other concern other than marriage,”
so Allah rebuked them on behalf o f His Prophet and defended him, he
said:

This is the especially dear friend o f Allah, the Imam o f the monotheists
who married Sarah who was the most beautiful o f women and took
Hajir under his guardianship. The Messenger o f Allah^S was asked who
the most beloved person to him is, and he replied: “Aisha.”

The Merciful Intercession the Prophet and His
Successors W ould Make for Others
The Prophet attempted to intercede on behalf o f a man w ho was in love
with a woman so that they can be wed, but she refused. This is in the
story o f M ughith and BarTrah. O ne day the Prophet saw him walking
behind her after they had separated as tears ran downs his cheeks, so the
Prophet said to her: “If only you would take him back as a husband.”
She replied: “Do you command me to do so, Messenger o f Allah ^ ? ” He
said: “No, but I would like to intercede on his behalf.” She said: “I do
not desire him.” Then the Prophet said to his uncle: “Abbas, are you not
amazed at the love that M ughith has for BarTrah, and the aversion she
has for him?”' The Prophet did not scold him for his love towards her,
even though she had separated from him, because this is something not
w ithin his control. The Prophet would balance his love for his wives as
much as he could and supplicate by saying: “Allah, this is what I can
control, do not hold me to account for what is not within my control .”2
This means the love o f the heart. Allah says:

“And you w ill never be able to be equal in feeling betw een w ives
even if you should strive to do so.” [A n-N isa’:129]

This means in love and intimacy. The rightly guided and merciful

An Infatuation Can Fall into O ne o f Three
Categories
Infatuation that can be used as obedience to Allah. It is the infatuation
someone may have towards his wife. This type o f love may be beneficial
as it may attract a person to fulfill the objective for which marriage was
legislated, it also leads a person to divert their gaze and innermost
feelings from anyone other than their spouse. Therefore, this particular
person who is in love may be commended by the people and approved
o f by Allah.
There is another type o f infatuation, it is the type that is detested by
Allah, an estrangement from His mercy and is the most harmful thing
upon an individual in his worldly life and for their affair in the Hereafter.
This is the love o f young hairless boys. Nobody has ever been trialed
with such a thing except that they have lost their entire honor in the
sight o f Allah, He expels him from any nearness to Him and distances
this individual’s heart from having a connection with Him.
It is from the most powerful veils that conceal him from Allah, as some
o f the Pious Predecessors have mentioned: If a person’s status falls before
Allah, he is trialed with a love for young hairless boys. This is the type
o f obsession that warranted the punishment that befell the people who
the Prophet Lut was sent to, it only occurred through this type o f
infatuation. Allah said:

(*4-4

“By your life [O M uham m ad^], indeed they were in their wild
intoxication, they were w andering blindly.” [al-Hijr:72]
However, the remedy for this illness is to seek the assistance o f the One
W ho turns the hearts, and an honest refuge with Him, occupying
oneself with His remembrance, increasing in His love and nearness and
contemplating over the pain that this type o f infatuation results in, the
pleasure that is squandered and thus an individual will consequently lose
out on the greatest beloved O ne and instead gain the greatest harm. So
if the soul inclines to this type o f action and gives it some preference, he
should consider himself amongst the dead and should come to know that
a great calamity has befallen him.
The third type o f infatuation is the kind that is permissible in and o f
itself, but the individual they are infatuated with is beyond their reach.
Such as a man who is wildly in love with a beautiful woman that has
been described to him, or a woman he accidently set his eyes on which
resulted in an infatuation o f this woman, yet this infatuation did not
bring about a sin on his part.
Hence, it is beyond his reach and shall not be reprimanded for it. It is
better for this person to repel these feelings and occupy oneself with
something more beneficial. It is imperative for such an individual to
suppress [such feelings], guard his ow n chastity and remain patient in
this trial he has been afflicted with. Consequently, Allah will reward him
for this and compensate him for his sincere patience, his guarding o f his
chastity and for not yielding to his desires whilst valuing the pleasure o f
Allah and the reward He affords over all else.

The Infatuated Ones Fall into Three Categories
Those w ho are infatuated by any beauty, and there are those who have
placed restrictions and are infatuated by a particular type o f beauty, and
there are those who do not become infatuated by anyone w ho they
cannot reach.
W ithin and between the above three categories are varying degrees o f
strength and weakness. The one w ho fits the first category w ho is
infatuated by any beauty will find themselves w andering in every distant
valley having an interest in any beautiful image.
O ne day in J u zw a and one day in ‘Uthayh and one — day in a l-‘Aqeeq and
another in K hulaysa
Sometimes turning to N a jd and at times — along the paths o f A l ’A qeeq and
at times in T aytna’

This is an expansive and far-reaching infatuation, and it is unstable and
constantly changing.
He contemplates about this one then he becomes infatuated with the other —
and forgets them fro m time to time

The one w ho has placed restrictions to the beauty is more fixed over the
one they are infatuated by and may have a longer lasting feeling o f love
towards them, and this love is stronger than the love o f the one who falls
into the first category due to it being concentrated on a particular person
and the other being divided and scattered. However, it is weakened by
the incapability o f reaching them. Thus, the infatuated one who is
realistic in achieving their objective is the most astute one, and this love
is stronger because the reality o f assists them and strengthens them.

A Study o f the Narration: “W hoever Becomes
Infatuated and Remains Chaste, Suppresses and
T hen Dies Is a M artyr.”
This narration has been cited by Suwayd bin Said, but the scholars o f
Islam have rejected its authenticity via him. Ibn ‘Adi said: “This is one
o f the narrations that have been rejected via Suwayd.” The same was
determined by al-Bayhaq! and Ibn Tahir and Abul-Faraj bin JawzT and
held it to be from the fabricated narrations through this chain o f
transmission. Abu Abdullah al-Hakim has also rejected the authenticity
o f this narration and commented: “I am surprised it has been narrated.”
I say: It is evident that this narration is from the speech o f Ibn Abbas may Allah be pleased with him - and the narration is M aw quf as far as Ibn
Abbas, and Suwayd was mistaken in attributing it to the Prophet. This
speech also does not resemble the speech o f the Prophet.
As for the narration o f al-Khatlb on the authority o f Az-ZuhrT who cites:
W e have been informed by al-M u’afa bin Zakariyyah, w ho cites from
Qutba bin al-Fadl, who cites from Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Masruq,
w ho cites from Suwayd, who cites from Ibn Mushir on the authority o f
Hisham bin ‘Urwah, on the authority o f his father, on the authority o f
Aisha who raises it as the statement o f the Prophet. However, this is a
clear mistake. The transmission o f Hisham from his father from Aisha is
unauthentic and unaccepted by anyone who has as much as smelt the
science o f the Hadlth. And I testify before Allah that Aisha never
narrated this narration from the Prophet, nor did ‘Urwah narrate it from
her, nor did Hisham ever narrate it from his father.

527

Thi- Disease A n d The Cure

As for the narration that has been presented via Ibn Majishun who cites
from Abdul-Aziz bin Abi Hatim, who cites from In Abi Najih, on the
authority o f Mujahid who narrates from Ibn Abbas who attributes the
narration to the Prophet, then it is also a lie against Ibn Majishun, as he
did not narrate this narration nor did Az-Zubayr bin Bakkar narrate it
from him. Rather, it is something that has been conjured up by the
fabricators. Subhan Allah! H ow could this text ever be connected to this
chain o f transmission?! May Allah disgrace the fabricators!
It has also been cited by Abul-Faraj on the authority o f Muhammad bin
Ja’far bin Sahl who cites from Ya’qub bin Isa from the son o f AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, on the authority o f Ibn Abi Najih, who cites from
Mujahid. This is also erroneous because Muhammah bin Ja’far as
mentioned in the chain o f transmission is someone who is also known
by the name ‘al-Kharaiti’. His death was in the year 327 HijrT. Therefore,
it would have been impossible for him to narrate from Ya’qub bin Abi
Najih. Additionally, ‘al-Kharaid’ is know n to be am ong the weak
narrators o f Hadlth and has been mentioned as such by Abul-Faraj in
the book ‘Ad-Du afa’ (the weak narrators).
The conclusion and studies o f the scholars o f Islam in rejecting this
particular narration is the scale we use, and it is they w ho are referred to
in this knowledge. Furthermore, it has not been authenticated or graded
as hasart by anyone o f fine repute and is a reference in the knowledge o f
Hadith, nor has it been authenticated by those who tend to portray
leniency in their grading o f narrations, as even they could not draw
themselves to authenticate it. It is sufficient that a man such as Ibn Tahir,
who was known to be lenient in authenticating the narrations that fit
the doctrine o f Sufism, narrating various texts in that regard that are
clearly unauthentic has also declared the narration m entioned above as
unauthentic.

528

The Disease A n d The Cure

It is correct though that this narration is not rejected pertaining to Ibn
Abbas. A young man whose body became alarmingly thin and slender
was brought before Ibn Abbas whilst on the plain o f Arafat, so he
enquired: W hat is the matter w ith him? They responded: He suffers
from infatuation. Thereafter, Ibn Abbas would seek refuge in Allah from
being afflicted with infatuation for periods o f the day. Such are the
hallmarks o f someone who would say “W hoever becomes infatuated and
remains chaste, suppresses and then dies is a m artyr.”
This study is further clarified through the narrations wherein the
Prophet listed the different martyrs. Amongst them he m entioned the
one who is killed on the battlefield in the cause o f Allah, the one who
dies due to an ailment o f the abdomen, the one w ho is burnt to death,
the mother w ho dies through child-birth, the one who drowns to death
and the one who dies through pleurisy. However, he did not mention
the one who dies through infatuation.
Nonetheless, it should suffice the one w ho has been a fatality to their
ow n infatuation to know that they cannot be included w ithin this
narration unless they are patient for the sake o f Allah, remain chaste for
the sake o f Allah and suppress anything forbidden for the sake o f Allah.
This is not attained unless the person is capable o f obtaining whatever it
is they are infatuated by, yet they favor the love o f Allah, fear Him and
seek His pleasure above all else. Such a people are most befittingly
referred to in the statement o f Allah:

“But as for the one w h o feared the position o f his Lord and
prevented the soul from unlawful inclination. T hen indeed,
Paradise w ill be his abode.” [A n -N azi’at:40,4l]
