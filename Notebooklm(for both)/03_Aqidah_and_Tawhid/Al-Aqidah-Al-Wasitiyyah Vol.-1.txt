In the Name o f Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

Introduction
All praise is due to Allah. And may the Salah and Salam be
upon our Prophet Muhammad
his Household and all of
his Companions.
As for what proceeds:
This is the book: Sharh A l-A qidah Al-Wasitiyyah by the
virtuous Shaikh Muhammad bin Salih Al-'Uthaimln. We are
producing it for the students of knowledge after the
completion of its review by the Shaikh himself, may Allah
preserve him. Thus, he corrected, revised, and added
important additions to it. Therefore, it resulted in an
appealing new form.
The book, A l-A qidah Al-Wasitiyyah, authored by Shaikh AlIslam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy upon him, is a
beneficial book summarizing the creed of the People of the
Sunnah and the Jama ah with the clearest clarifications and
simplest of expressions. Hence, despite this booklet's small
size, it is among the best of what has been collected and
written on the topic. There is no better evidence of this,
than the great care of the scholars in explaining it, and
teaching it to the students of knowledge.
Our scholars have been keen to teach their students such
summarizing texts, then, after that, they move on to what is
broader and more encompassing.

10

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The virtuous Shaikh Muhammad bin Salih Al-'Uthaimm may Allah bring benefit through his knowledge - followed
this method. He used to always stress focusing on the likes
of these summarized texts, and memorizing them.
Thus, in his classes on creed, for example, he would teach
the book Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah and Kitab At-Tawhid by
Shaikh Al-Islam Muhammad bin 'Abdul-W ahhab, may
Allah have mercy upon him. In Fiqh, (he would teach)
the book Zad Al-Mustaqni by Al-Hajjawi, may Allah have
mercy upon him, in Al-Fara'id (inheritance law); Manzumah
A l-Q alaid Al-Burhaniyyah, in Nahw (grammar); Al-Ajriimiyyah, and so on for the rest of his classes.
Consequently, this method had a profound influence in the
souls of his students and those who listened to him. So his
books and audios spread throughout the Islamic lands of
the east and the west, and by that, Allah brought
tremendous benefit.
This encouraged publishing houses to bring out the writings
and booklets of the Shaikh, may Allah preserve him, and for a
long time this was the case with Dar Ibn Al-Jawzi publishers
and distributors. So, all praise is due to Allah, Exalted is He,
and we thank Him for making that easy for us.
This book has been published before. However, in reality, it
was not given its rightful examination and the verification
by the Shaikh, may Allah rectify him. This is why, the
virtuous Shaikh reviewed the book, corrected it, looked it
over and amended what was lacking in the first edition.
Accordingly, this edition of the book is truly better than the
one that preceded it.
My Work in the Book:
I verified the Hadiths and the Athar (narrations) that I was

Introduction

11

able to find. So, if it was in the Two Sahihs, or one of them, I
considered them to be sufficient. And if found in other than
them, I would refer it to the most important of them in the
interest of brevity. We also mentioned what was said about
it from authenticity and weakness, taking the statements of
the scholars who are considered in this science, as guide;
without us adding more than that.
I indexed the Hadiths of the text and the commentary, as
well as another index for the topics of the book.
I chose not to mention the biography of Shaikh Al-lslam Ibn
Taymiyyah, considering the numerous biographies pro­
duced about him, may Allah have mercy upon him, to be
sufficient.^
As well, we mentioned a brief biography for Shaikh
Muhammad bin 'Uthaimin, which was written by our
brother Walid bin Ahmad Al-Husain.
This is the small effort (that I produced), and I am aware
that there are those among the students of knowledge who
are more worthy of this work. Thus, I ask Allah, Exalted is
He, for pardon and forgiveness, and to guide us to
whatever goodness and correctness it contains.
As I see that it is obligatory upon me to thank Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, first and foremost. Then, to the
virtuous Shaikh Muhammad bin 'Uthaimin, may Allah
benefit with his knowledge, who appointed us to take care
of printing this book, verifying its Hadiths and reviewing it.
As I also thank the brothers from Dar Al-Hasan publishing

In conclusion, I ask Allah, Exalted is He, to make this work
sincerely for His Face, there being no one who has a share
in it. Also, to forgive me whatever mistakes it contains.
Indeed, He is the Hearing, Responding, and may the Saldh
and Salam be upon our Prophet Muhammad -ge, his
Household and all of his Companions.

A Brief Biography of
A l- ‘A lla m a h Muhammad bin
Salih Al-‘Uthaimin
1347-1421H
•

•

---------

His Name, Lineage and Birth
He is the virtuous Shaikh, the scholar, the Muhaqqiq, the
Faqih, the Mufassir, the Wan', the Zahid, Muhammad bin
Salih bin Muhammad bin 'Abdur-Rahman Al 'Uthaimin,
from Al-Wahbah, from Banu At-Tarrum.
He was born on the eve of the 27th of the blessed month of
Ramadan, in the year 1347 H, in 'Unaizah - one of the cities
of Al-Qaslm - in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
His Educational Upbringing
His father - may Allah have mercy upon him - enrolled him
as a student to learn the Noble Qur'an, with his maternal
grandfather, the teacher 'Abdur-Rahman bin Sulaiman AdDamigh, may Allah have mercy upon him. Then, he
learned writing and some arithmetic, and the texts of Adab
(literatures), in the Madrasah (school) of Al-Ustadh 'Abdul' Aziz bin Salih Ad-Damigh - may Allah preserve him - and
that was before he enrolled in the Madrasah of the teacher
'All bin 'Abdullah bin Ash-Shahltan - may Allah have
mercy upon him - where he memorized the Noble Qur'an

14

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

by heart, while he had not yet passed the age of 14.
Also, under the guidance of his father - may Allah have
mercy upon him - he was encouraged to seek Shari'ah
knowledge, and at that time, the virtuous Shaikh, Al'Alldmah 'Abdur-Rahman bin Nasir As-Sa'di, may Allah
have mercy upon him, was teaching 'Ulum Ash-Shari'ah
and Arabic, in Al-Jami' Al-Kabir at 'Unaizah. Furthermore,
he had appointed two of his senior students ^ to teach the
newer students. Thus, the Shaikh enrolled into the circle of
Shaikh Muhammad bin 'Abdul-'Aziz Al-Mutawwa' - may
Allah have mercy upon him. Until he obtained from the
knowledge regarding Tawhid, Fiqh and grammar what he
obtained.
Then, he attended the circle of his Shaikh, Al-'Allamah
'Abdur-Rahman bin Nasir As-Sa'di - may Allah have
mercy upon him - with whom he studied Tafsir, Hadith, the
Prophetic Sirah, Tawhid, Fiqh, Usui, inheritance laws, and
grammar. He also memorized summary texts in these areas
of knowledge.
The virtuous Shaikh, Al-'Alldtnah 'Abdur-Rahman bin Nasir
As-Sa'di - may Allah have mercy upon him - is considered
his first Shaikh; since he took from him the knowledge, by
becoming familiar with it and its methods, more than
anyone else. Therefore, he was influenced by his metho­
dology, his way of fortifying the fundamentals, his method
of teaching, and his manner of following the evidences.
And while Shaikh 'Abdur-Rahman bin 'All bin 'Awdan may Allah have mercy upon him - was a judge in 'Unaizah,
he read texts in the knowledge of inheritance with him, just

as he read (texts) in grammar and eloquence with Shaikh
'Abdur-Razzaq Al-'Aflfl, during his tenure as a teacher in
that city.
Upon the opening of the Knowledge Institute (Al-Ma'had
Al-'Ilimi) in Ar-Riyadh, one of his brothers^ indicated that
he should enroll in it. So he sought the permission of his
Shaikh Al-'Alldmah 'Abdur-Rahman bin Nasir As-Sa'di may Allah have mercy upon him - and he granted him
permission and he enrolled in the Institute during the years
of 1372-1373H.
During the two years he was enrolled at the Institute in ArRiyadh, he benefited from the scholars that were teaching
therein at that time, and among them were Al-'Alldmah, AlMufassir Shaikh Muhammad Al-Amln Ash-Shinqlti, the
Shaikh, the Faqih 'Abdul-'Aziz bin Nasir Rashid, and the
Shaikh and Muhaddith 'Abdur-Rahman Al-Afrlql - may
Allah, Exalted is He, have mercy upon them all.
During that time, he began studying with his eminence
Shaikh, the 'Allamah 'Abdul-'Aziz bin 'Abdullah Ibn Baz may Allah have mercy upon him. He read before him, in
the Masjid, from Sahih Al-Bukhari, and from the writings of
Shaikh Al-lslam Ibn Taymiyyah. He also benefited from him
in the knowledge/ science of Hadfth, examining the views
of the Fuqahd' of the different Madhhabs, and comparisons
between them. Moreover, his eminence, Shaildi 'Abdul'Azlz bin Baz - may Allah have mercy upon him - is
considered his second Shaikh, due to obtaining (knowledge
from him) and being influenced by him.
Then, in the year 1374H., he returned to 'Unaizah, and
began studying with his Shaikh, Al-'Alldmah 'Abdur-Rah[11

That being Shaikh 'All bin Hamad As-Salihl, may Allah have
mercy upon him.

man bin Nasir As-Sa'dI, while continuing his studies by
enrolling in the College of Shari’ah, which became a part of
the Imam Muhammad bin Sa'tid Islamic University, where
he attained a diploma of higher learning.
His Teaching
His Shaikh observed his cleverness and the speed at which
he attained knowledge. Thus, he encouraged him to teach,
while he continued to be a student in his circle. So, he
began teaching in the year 1370H in Al-Jami' Al-Kabir in
'Unaizah.
Upon his graduation from the Knowledge Institute in ArRiyadh, he was appointed to teach in the Knowledge
Institute in 'Unaizah, in the year 1374H.
In the year 1376H, his Shaikh, Al-'Allamah 'Abdur-Rahman
bin Nasir As-Sa'di - may Allah have mercy upon him passed away, so he replaced him as Imam at Al-Jdmi' AlKabir in 'Unaizah, as Imam for the two 'Eid prayers in
('Unaizah), and teaching in the National Library of
'Unaizah, of the Jdmi', which was founded by his Shaikh may Allah have mercy upon him - in the year 1359H.
When his students increased and the library became
insufficient to accommodate them, the virtuous Shaikh may Allah have mercy upon him - began teaching in the
Masjid of Al-Jami' itself. Students gathered around him, and
they flocked from around the Kingdom as well as other
than it, until they have reached hundreds in some of the
lessons. And these students were seriously seeking knowl­
edge, not merely coming to listen. He continued as Imam,
Khatib, and teacher, until his death - may Allah, Exalted is
He, have mercy upon him.
The Shaikh remained a teacher in the Knowledge Institute
from the year 1374H to the year 1398H, when he was

transferred to teaching in the College of Shari'ah and Usui
Ad-Din in Al-Qasim, part of the Imam Muhammad bin
Sa'ud Islamic University, and he continued a professorship
there until his death, may Allah have mercy upon him.
He also taught in Al-Masjid Al-Haram and Al-Masjid AnNabawi (the Prophetic Masjid) during Hajj season, Rama­
dan, and summer breaks, from the year 1402H until his
death, may Allah have mercy upon him.
The Shaikh - may Allah have mercy upon him - possessed a
method of teaching that is unique in its quality and its
success. He would engage his students and take their
questions. He would also deliver the lessons and lectures
with high eagerness and a soul that is (full of) tranquility
and confidence; delighted in spreading knowledge and
bringing it closer to the people.
His Contributions to Knowledge
His magnificent efforts - may Allah have mercy upon him became apparent during his more than fifty years of
conferring and sacrificing in the spread of knowledge,
teaching, exhortations, guidance, instruction, delivering
lectures, and calling (Da'ivah) to Allah, Glorious and
Exalted is He.
He had great concern for writings and issuing Fatzvas and
answers, which were distinguished for their firm founda­
tion in knowledge, resulting in tens of books, treaties,
lessons, Fatzvas, Khutbahs, interviews and articles. Similarly,
the result was thousands of hours of audio recordings of
his lectures, Khutbahs, interviews, radio programs, and his
educational lessons in Tafsfr of the Noble Qur'an, his
distinguished explanations of the Noble Hadith, the
Prophetic Sirah, and texts and textual poems (Manzumdt)
in the knowledge of Shari'ah and grammar.

The Introduction of
the Second Edition
Indeed, all praise is due to Allah. We praise Him, ask His
help and His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the
evil of our selves and our mischief of our deeds. Whomever
Allah guides, none can misguide him. And whomever is
misguided, none can guide him. And I bear witness that
there is none worthy of worship except Allah, Alone,
without partners for Him. And I bear witness that
Muhammad is His Servant and Messenger, may the Salah
and abundant Salam of Allah be upon him, his Household,
his Companions and all those who followed them faith­
fully, until the Day of Recompense.
To proceed: Indeed, Allah, Exalted is He, has favored us
with the explanation of Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah which was
authored by Shaikh Al-lslam Ibn Taymiyyah, concerning the
creed of the People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah, which
was a lecture delivered to the students who studied it
under us in the Masjid. And because of their eagerness in
preserving the lesson, they recorded it, then transcribed it
into writing based upon these recordings.
It is well known that the explanation that received from a
lecture is not like the explanation that is written and edited.
That is because the first one is more susceptible to decrease
and increase than the second one.
Many publication companies have requested printing it.
And Maktabah Tabariyyah has preceded in that. Thus, it
published it in a fresh look, along with beneficial notes,

24

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

verification and references for its Hadiths, by our brother
Abu Muhammad Ashraf bin 'Abdul-Maqsud bin 'AbdulRahim, may Allah facilitate him to what is right, and
reward him with good.
But, since the explanation that is received from a lecture is
not like the explanation that is written and edited, I found it
important to read the explanation with great care in order
to produce the explanation in a way that was satisfactory.
Therefore, I did that, and to A llah is the praise.
Furthermore, I deleted what is not needed and added that
which was needed.
I ask Allah, Exalted is He, to bring benefit by it, as He
brought benefit from its original, and to make us from
those callers to the truth and its supporters. Indeed, He is
Near, and responds.

Introduction
In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful. May the
Salah and Salam be upon our Prophet, Muhammad, his
Household and all of his Companions.
Thereafter;
Indeed, this book, entitled Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah was
written by the great scholar of the Ummah in his time: Abu
Al-'Abbas, Shaikh Al-Isldm, Ahmad bin Abdul Halim bin
'Abdus-Salam bin Taymiyyah Al-Harranl, may Allah have
mercy upon him. Who died in the year 728 AH.
The prestige of this man - which he is thanked for, and
which we hope Allah rewards him for - in defense of the
truth and the confrontation of the people of falsehood, is
something known to anyone who reads and researches in
his books.
The reality is that he is one of the favors of Allah upon this
Ummah. For by him, Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He,
restrained tremendous dangerous matters from the Islamic
creed.
This book is written as a summary, entitled: Al-'Aqidah AlWasitiyyah. It is authored by Shaikh Al-Islam when a man
who was a judge in (a place known as) Wasit came to him,
and com plained of the people's suffering from the
methodologies deviating in matters of the Names and
Attributes of Allah. Therefore, he wrote this (book of) creed
which is regarded as the core for the creed of the People of
Sunnah and Jamd'ah, regarding those issues about which
people spread various innovations, and about which there
is a great deal of baseless talk and conjecture.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Before we begin to discuss this very marvelous book, we
would like to explain that all the m essages of the
Messengers from their first, Nuh, may the Salah and Salam
be upon him, to their last, Muhammad ^ - each of them
was inviting to Tawhid. Allah, Exalted is He, says:
'S/i 2[ S/ $

J a

t

& d L ji C j f

4And We did not send any Messenger before you, but
We inspired him (saying): “La Ilaha Ilia And (there is
no deity except I), so worship Me (Alone and none
e ls e ) / y (Al-Anbiya 21:25)
And He, Exalted is He, says:
sJj 4&\

4 L il

f

$And verily, We have sent among every Ummah
(community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): “Wor­
ship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) AtTdghut (all false d e it ie s ) .( A n - N a h l 16:36)
And that is because the creation was created only for One
and He is Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. They were
created for His worship, so that their hearts would cling to
Him with veneration, exaltation, fear, hope, reliance,
longing and awe, such that they would restrain themselves
from everything in this world that will not aid them in
singling out Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, Alone, in these
matters; since you are a creature, thus, you must belong to
your Creator, who has total control of everything.
That is why the invitation of the Messengers, may the Salah
and Salam be upon them, was for this significant and
important matter, the worship of Allah Alone, without

Introduction

27

associating any partner with Him.
The Messengers whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
sent to mankind did not invite people to Tawhid ArRubiibiyyah as they invited to Tawhid Al-Uliihiyyah. That is
because those who denied Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah are very
few in number, such that those who reject this openly could
not do so within the depth of their hearts. No, by Allah,
except if they had been completely deprived of their
discerning senses, but they rejected it out of arrogance and
condemnable pride.
The scholars, may Allah have mercy upon them, have
categorized Tawhid into three:
Firstly: Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah
That is to single out Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, in
three matters: Creating, ownership and disposition of
affairs.
The evidence for that is His statement, Exalted is He:

iS u rely , His is the Creation and Commandment^ (AlA ‘rdf 7:54)
The evidence in the Ayah is that the predicate is mentioned
first, whereas the predicate is supposed to be mentioned
last, and the rhetorical principle is that whenever what is
supposed to be mentioned last is mentioned first, that
proves specificity.
Besides, consider the introduction of this Ayah with (the
word) Ala (surely) which is used to express caution and
emphasis:

28

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

^Surely, His is the Creation and C om m an d m en t(A lA ‘rdf 7:54)
Not for other than Him. As for creation, this is His, and the
commandment refers to the disposition of affairs.
As for ownership, its evidence, for example, is His
statement, Exalted is He:
cfjC LJi
iA n d to Allah belongs the kingdom o f the heavens and
the earthy (Al-Jathiyah 45:27)
For this proves His sole right of ownership, Glorious and
Exalted is He. The evidence in this Ayah is as mentioned
before (concerning the last Ayah) regarding putting
forward what should come later.
Therefore, the Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, is Alone in
creating, ownership, and disposition of affairs.
If you may ask: How do you reconcile between what you
have acknowledged, and the affirmation of creating for
other than Allah, such as His statement, Exalted is He:

^So blessed be Allah,
Mu'minun 23:14)

the Best o f c r e a t o r s (A l-

And such as his saying j*§; concerning the image makers: "It
will be said to them: 'Give life to that which you
created .'"^
[11

Based on what was reported by Al-Bukhari (5961) and
Muslim (2107) from 'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her,
that the Messenger ^ said: "Indeed the makers of these
images will be punished on the Day of Judgment, and it will
be said to them: 'Give life to that which you created.'"

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

that is called besides Allah, be it trees, stones, human
beings, Angels or any other thing, everything that they
called upon besides Allah: 4 Cannot create (even) a fly , even
though they combine together fo r the purpose4 (Al-Hajj 22:73)
So, if everyone were to individually attempt that, his
incapability would be much more obvious: i^And if the fly
snatched away a thing from them, they would have no power
to release it from the fly -f Even those who are called upon
besides Allah, if a fly takes something away from them,
they will not be able to retrieve it from this weak fly. If a
fly falls on the most powerful king on the earth and
sucks up his perfume, this king will not be able to
retrieve this perfume from this fly; the same is the case if
it falls on his food. So, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is
the Sole Creator.
If you may say: How do you reconcile between your
statements: "A llah is Alone in ownership” and the
affirmation of ownership for creatures, such as His
statement, Exalted is He:

4 0 r (from that) w hereof you hold keys$ (An-Niir 24:61)
(And His saying, Exalted is He):

^Except from their wives or (the captives and slaves)
that their right hands possess4 (Al-Mu’minun 23:6)?
The response: The reconciliation can be from two perspec­
tives:
Firstly: Man's ownership of something is not general and
complete. (For example,) I own w hat is under my

Introduction

31

authority; I don't own what is under your authority; but
everything is owned by Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. So
from the view of entirety, the ownership of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, is more general and broader owner­
ship.
Secondly: My ownership of this thing is not a real
ownership where I can do whatever I like with it. I can
only do with it as the Shari1 commands and as the real
Owner permits, Who is Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
Supposing I trade a Dirham for two Dirhams, I do not own
that, and that is not permissible for me. Hence, my
ownership is limited.
Besides, I have no control over it from the view of the Qadr.
Because the control is with Allah, and as such, I cannot say
to my sick slave: "Be healthy” and then he becomes
healthy. I cannot say to my able-bodied healthy slave: "Be
sick” and then he becomes sick. The real control of affairs is
Allah's, the Mighty and Sublime. If He says to him: "Be
healed,” he will be healed. If He says: "Be sick,” he will be
sick. Therefore, I do not have absolute control, from the
view of legislation, nor from the view of ability. So, my
ownership is restricted from the view of controlling affairs,
and limited from being all inclusive and absolutely general.
With this, it becomes clear to us how it is that Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, is alone in ownership.
As for the disposition of affairs, man has the ability to
dispose of affairs, but we say that this ability to dispose of
affairs is limited, just like the two cases that preceded
concerning ownership. So I do not have the ability to
dispose of affairs for everything; I only have the ability to
dispose of the affairs under my custody and control. And
similarly, I do not have the authority to dispose of any
affair except in accord with the S h an , which allowed this

32

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

disposition of affairs for me.
Hence, it becomes clear that our statement: "Indeed, Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, is alone in creating, ownership
and the disposition of affairs” is universally absolute,
nothing is exempt from that, because nothing we have
mentioned contradicts what is affirmed for Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, concerning that.
The Second Category: Tawhid Al-Uluhiyyah
That is to single out Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, in
worship, such that you do not be a slave to other than
Allah. You do not worship an Angel, or a Prophet, a Wall (a
pious servant), a Shaikh, mother or father. You do not
worship, except Allah alone; and single out Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, alone, by deifying Him, and worship.
That it is why it is referred to as the Tawhid of Al-Uluhiyyah
(divinity), and it is also called the Tawhid of Al-'Ihadah
(worship). So in reference to Allah, it is Tawhid AlUluhiyyah, and in reference to the slave, it is Tawhid AlTbadah.
Worship is built upon two important things, and they are
love and reverence, whose result:

4 Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and
they used to call on Us with hope and fearfy (Al-Anbiya
21:90)
So, with love, there will be hope, and with reverence, there
will be awe and fear.
That is why worship consists of commands and prohibi­
tions. Commands are built upon hope and longing to draw
near to the One who gave the command. And prohibitions

are built upon reverence and awe from the Magnificent
One.
If you love Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, you will indeed
long for what is with Him, and you will long to draw
nearer to Him, and seek the means to draw nearer to Him.
So, you abide in His obedience in a complete manner.
When you revere Him, you will fear Him. Whenever you
want to commit an act of disobedience, you will promptly
sense the greatness of the Creator, the Mighty and Sublime,
and flee from it:

4And indeed she did desire him, and he would have
inclined to her desire, had he not seen the evidence o f
his Lord. Thus it was, that We might turn away from
him evil and Fahishah (illegal sexual intercourse)^
(Yusuf 12:24)
This is of Allah's favor upon you. If you intend to commit a
sin, you find Allah before you, so you would be frightened,
full of fear, and stay far away from disobedience, because
you worship Allah, with hope, and awe.
Then, what is the meaning of T bd d ah (worship)?
The word 'Ibadah (worship) can be used to mean two
things; to mean the action, and what is done.
It is used to mean the action, which is to worship, and it can
be said: "The man worshiped his Lord” in the real manner
of worship. Its usage to mean worship falls under the
category of using the infinitive name to represent the
infinitive. When it is used to mean the action, we define it
as: subjugation to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, with love

34

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

and reverence, by doing what He ordered, and staying
away from what He prohibited. Whoever humbles himself
for Allah, Allah will honor him:

4But honor, power and glory belong to Allah and His
Messenger
(Al-Munafiqun 63:8)
It is used for what is done, that is, the acts of worship, and
according to this meaning, that one can understand how
Shaikh Al-Isldm, Ibn Taymiyyah defined it, when he, may
Allah have mercy upon him, said: "W orship is a name that
refers to all of what Allah loves, and is pleased with;
sayings, actions, external, and internal."^
This, with which we worship Allah, requires that it be done
with Tawhid, not being done for other than Him; such as
Saldh, fasting, Zakah, Hajj, supplications, vows, fear,
reliance and the like, among the forms of worship.
If you say: What is the evidence that Allah is to be singled
out with Uluhiyyah (divinity)?
The response is that: There are many evidences for that,
among them are His statement:

'0
$And We did not send any Messenger before you, but
We inspired him (saying) : "La Ildha Ilia And (there is
no deity except I (Allah)), so worship Me (Alone and
none else)."$ (Al-Anbiya' 21:25)

(And)

4And verily, We have sent among every Ummah
(community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): "Wor­
ship Allah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from ) AtTdghut (all false deities)."$> (An-Nahl 16:36)
And also His statement, Exalted is He:

4Allah bears witness that La Ilaha Ilia Huwa (there is
no deity except Him), and the Angels, and those having
knowledge (also give this w i t n e s s ( A l 'Imran 3:18)
If there is no other virtue of knowledge except this point;
that is Allah informing that none testifies to His Uluhiyyah
except those having knowledge, (then this suffices), we ask
Allah to make us among them:

4Alldh bears witness that La Ilaha Ilia Huwa (there is
no deity except Him), and the Angels, and those having
knowledge (also give this w itness); (He is always)
maintaining His creation with Al-Qisfy (Al 'Imran
3:18)
That is, with justice. Then, He confirms this testimony with
His statement:

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

36

4 La Ilaha Ilia Huwa (there is not deity except Him), the
Mighty, the Wisefy (Al 'Imran 3:18)
This is a clear evidence that there is no deity except Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime. I testify to La ilaha ill Allah and all
of you testify to La ilaha ill Allah
This is the testimony of truth. But if someone asks: How do
you acknowledge this while Allah, Exalted is He, affirms
the existence of gods other than Him? Such as His
statement, Exalted is He:

4And invoke not any other Ildh (god) alone with Alldh4
(Al-Qasas 28:88)
And such as His statement:

4And whoever invokes, besides Allah, any other Ildh
(god), o f whom he has no proofs (Al-Mu'minun 23:117)
And His statement:
Cjt $
4So their Aliha (gods), other than Allah, whom they
invoked, profited them n a u g h t ( H u d 1 1 :101)
And such as the statement of Ibrahim:
aA oji

4ls it the falsehood o f Aliha (gods) other than Allah that
you seek?4 (As-Sdffat 3 7 :86)
Among other Aydt.
How do we reconcile between these, and the testimony that

Introduction

37

there is no deity besides Allah?
The response is that the Uluhiyyah (divinity) of other than
Allah is false Uluhiyyah (divinity), it is merely a name:

$They are hut names which you have named, you and
your fathers, fo r which Allah has sent down no
a u t h o r i t y (An-Najm 53:23)
Their U luhiyyah is false, so even though they are
worshipped and deified by the one who has strayed; they
are not worthy of that worship. So the deities that are
worshipped, but they are false deities:

iT h at is because Allah, He is the Truth, and that which
they invoke besides Him is Al-Batil.)> (Luqmdn 31:30)
None of the people of the Qiblah, attributing themselves to
Islam, will deny these two kinds of Tawhid, because Allah,
the Exalted, was indeed singled out in His Rububiyyah
(Lordship) and Uluhiyyah (divinity); but later some people
started attributing divinity to some human beings; such as
done by the overzealous among the Rafidah who said: "A ll
is a god!" As did their leader 'Abdullah bin Saba' when he
went to 'All bin Abl Talib, may Allah be pleased with him,
and said to him: "You are indeed Allah!!"
But 'Abdullah bin Saba' was originally a Jew; he entered to
Islam and claimed partisanship to the members of the
Household to bring confusion to the Muslims about their
religion, was stated by Shaikh Al-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah,
may Allah have mercy upon him. He said: "This was as
what Paul did when he embraced Christianity in order to

38

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

destroy it."[11
This man, 'Abdullah bin Saba', said to 'All bin Abi Talib,
may Allah be pleased with him: "You are indeed Allah!!"
And 'All bin Abi Talib was not pleased with anybody
exaggerating about his status, so he, may Allah be pleased
with him, out of his fairness, justice, knowledge and
experience, would say on the Minbar in Al-Kufah: "The best
of this Ummah after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then
'U m ar."^ He was announcing that during the Khutbah,
and this has been reported from him, may Allah be pleased
with him, in Mutawdtir form.
The one who said this, and affirmed the virtue of those
humans worthy of that — how could he be pleased with
someone saying to him: "You are Allah?!" That is why he
gave them the worst punishment. He ordered that deep
pits be dug, and they were dug and filled with firewood,
and lit with fire. Thereafter, he cast these people into the
fire, because the gravity of their fabrication — and refuge is
sought from Allah — was not simple.
It was said that 'Abdullah bin Saba' fled without being

As-Sahabah (397). Also, Ibn Abi 'Asim in As-Sunnah (2:570),
and Ibn Majah (106), from 'All bin Abi Talib, may Allah be
pleased with him. The basis of the Hadith is in Sahih AlBukhari (3671) from Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyyah, that he
said: "I asked to my father ('All bin Abi Talib): 'Who from
the people is the most virtuous after the Messenger of Allah
j||?' He said: 'Abu Bakr.'" He said: "I asked: 'Then who?' He
said: 'Then 'U m ar.'"

caught. What is important is that 'All bin Abl Talib, may
Allah be pleased with him, burnt As-Saba'iyyah (the
followers of 'Abdullah bin Saba') with fire because they
attributed divinity to him.
So we say that all of those among the people of the Qiblah,
they do not deny these two kinds of Tawhid.They are
Tawhid Ar-Rububiyyah and Tawhid Al-Uluhiyyah, even
though some of the people of innovation can be found
attributing divinity to a human being.
But the category over which there is often disagreement
among the people of the Qiblah is:
The Third Category: Tawhid Al-Asma Wa As-Sifat
This is where there are many areas of disagreement. People
divided into three categories concerning it; they are:
likening, denying, or being balanced. And the one who
denies, he either belies, or, he distorts.
The first innovation that occurred in this Ummah was the
innovation of the Khawarij. Their leader rebelled against the
Prophet
He was Dhu Al-Khuwaysirah from Ban!
Tamim, when the Prophet
distributed some gold ore
that came to him. He distributed it among the people, and
this man said to him: "O Muhammad, be just!"*11 This was
the first rebellion against the Shan ah of Islam. Then, their
tribulation waxed stronger during the last period of the
reign of 'Uthman, and during the turmoil between 'Ali and
Mu'awiyah; thus, they declared the Muslims as disbelie­
vers, and made their blood lawful.
Then there came the innovation of the Qadariyyah, who are
the Zoroastrians of this Ummah, those who said that Allah,
*:1

Al-Bukhan (3610) and Muslim (1063 and 148) from Abu
Sa'ld Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him.

40

Commentary on Al-'Ac]idah Al-Wasitiyyah

Glorious and Exalted is He, did not decree the actions of
the slaves, they (the actions of man) do not fall under His
will, as they are not His creations. Their leaders and the
extremists among them even said that they (the actions) are
not known to Allah, and were not written in Al-Lawh AlMahfuz (the Preserved Tablet) and Allah is not aware of
what people do until it occurs. They also said "The matter
is new.” Meaning just occurring. These people met the last
part of the period of Companions; they met the time of
'Abdullah bin 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him,
'Ubadah bin As-Samit and a group of other Companions
but it was during the last end of the era of the Companions.
Then the innovation of Irja followed which met the time of
many of the Tabi'in. The Murji'ah are the ones who say: "Acts
of disobedience do not cause harm in the presence of faith.”
Are you a believer? If you say yes, he would tell you: "The
acts of disobedience do not cause harm in the presence of
faith;” if you fornicate, steal, consume wine, and murder, as
long as you are a believer, then you are a believer with perfect
faith, even if you commit all kinds of sins!
However, Shaikh Al-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah said: "The
assertions of the Qadariyyah and the Murji'ah when they
were rebutted by the Companions who remained, only had
to do with obedience and disobedience, the believer and
the Fasiq, they did not argue concerning their Lord and His
Attributes.”
Then, came some people who regarded themselves as
rationalists, from those who claimed that the intellect
should be given preference over revelation. So they came
up with a statement that was between the two other
sayings - the view of the Murji'ah and the view of the
Khawarij. They said: "The one who commits a major sin is
not a believer as said by the Murji'ah, and not a disbeliever

Introduction

41

as said by the Khawarij; he is rather in a position between
the two positions, such as a traveler from a city to another,
and he is already on the journey, he is neither in his town
nor in the town he is traveling to, he is rather in a place
between the two places. This is pertaining to the rulings in
this world. But as regards the Hereafter, he is going to
abide forever in H ell." Therefore, they agree with the
Khawarij concerning his status in the Hereafter; but in this
worldly life, they disagree with them.
This innovation began and became widespread. Then came
the innovation of the oppressors and the Jahmiyyah. It was the
innovation of Jahm bin Safwan and his followers who were
named Al-Jahmiyyah. This innovation occurred, and did not
have to do with the matter concerning the terms given to
people and the rulings concerning them — is one a believer, a
disbeliever, or a Fasiq — nor regarding a position between the
two positions; but it has to do with the Self of the Creator.
Look at how innovations increased in stages from the early
period of Islam, until they reached the Creator, the Sublime
and Exalted. They gave the Creator the status of a creature.
They say as they like; and so they say: This is affirmed for
Allah, this is not affirmed. The intellect accepts that Allah is
described with this; while the intellect does not accept that
He is described with that. So, the innovation of the
Jahmiyyah and the the Mu'tazilah began, and they were
divided about the Names and Attributes of Allah into a
number of groups:
1. A group which said that it is never permissible to
describe Allah, neither with existence nor with non­
existence, because if He is described with existence, He
would be likened to existing beings, and if He is
described with non-existence, He will be likened to
non-existing things. Based on this, it is necessary to

42

2.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

negate existence and non-existence from Him. The
position that they held is a form of likening the Creator
to the unfeasible and impossible, because the combina­
tion of existence and non-existence is a combination of
two contradictory things, while two contradictory
things cannot be gathered together nor can they both
be exalted. Every sane human being would reject this
and never accept it. Look at how they ran away from
something and fell into what is worse.
Another group said, we describe Him with negation; we
do not describe Him with affirmation. Meaning that,
they allow that Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, be
denied attributes, but not affirmed them. Meaning, we
will not say He is Living, we will rather say, He is not
dead. We will not say He is Knowing, but we will say He
is not ignorant, etc. They claimed that if you affirm an
attribute for Him, you have likened Him to existing
beings. This is because, in their own thinking, all the
existing beings are alike. Hence, do not affirm anything
for Him. But as for the negation, that indicates the lack of
such thing; even though Allah's Attributes are affirming
in the Book and the Sunnah more than negating.

It is said to them, Allah said regarding Himself: Hearing,
Seeing.
They replied: These are just mere attributions, meaning
hearing is attributed to Him; not that He is described with it,
but because He has a creature that hears, so it is just by the way
of attribution. Therefore, Hearing means He does not have
hearing, but He possesses what is heard. A second group
came and said: These attributes are for His creatures, not for
Him. But as for Him, no attribute is established for Him.
3.

The Third group said: Names, but not attributes, are
affirmed for Him. These people are the Mu'tazilah. They

Introduction

4.

43

affirmed the Names of Allah. They said, Allah is
Hearing, Seeing, Powerful, Knowing, Wise, but He is
Powerful without power, Hearing without hearing,
Seeing without sight, Knowing without knowledge, the
Wise without wisdom.
The Fourth group said: We will affirm the Names for
Him in reality, and we will also affirm for Him the
specific Attributes which are indicated by the intellect,
and reject the rest. We only affirm seven Attributes for
Him, and we deny the rest; distorting them, not belying
them. For were they to belie it, they would have
disbelieved, but their rejection of it is by distorting it,
something which they refer to as Ta'wil (interpretation).

The seven Attributes which they affirm are combined in the
saying:
To Him belong life, speech and seeing,
Hearing, will, knowledge and power
(They say) we affirm these Attributes because the intellect
indicates them, and the rest of the attributes are not
indicated by the intellect. So we affirm what is indicated by
the intellect, and we reject what is not indicated by the
intellect. And these people are the Ash'aris, they believe in
some, and reject some.
These are the various kinds of denials of the Names and
Attributes; all of them branched out from the innovation of
Jahm (bin Safwan), and "Anyone who institutes an evil
practice in Islam, upon him is its burden and that, of those
who act upon it until the Day of Resurrection."^
The summary of the matter is that if you, O brother, read
[11

Part of a Hadith that was reported by Muslim (1017) from the
Hadith of Jarir bin 'Abdullah Al-Bajall, may Allah be pleased
with him.

44

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

concerning this matter in the books of the people who are
concerned with the collection and mentioning different
views of people about it, you will see the weirdest things,
about which you would say: "H ow could a sane person,
not to mention a believer, makes such an assertion?!” But
whoever that Allah does not give light to, he will never
have light! The one whose insight is blinded by Allah is like
the one whose sight is blinded by Allah. Just as the
physically blind person can not see the light of the Sun,
which would damage his sight if he were to look directly at
it, such is the one whose insight was blinded by Allah; if he
stands before the lights of the truth, he will not see them and refuge is sought from Allah.
That is why we have to constantly ask Allah, Exalted is He,
to keep us firm upon this matter, and that He not make our
hearts deviate after He has guided us; because this is a
dangerous matter, and the Shaitan enters upon the son of
Adam from every side and every angle, and causes
confusion for him about his creed, his religion, in the Book
of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. These in reality,
are the innovations that have become widespread in the
Islamic Ummah.
However, all praise is due to Allah, no one will ever
introduce an act of innovation except that out of His favor
and generosity, Allah raises against him those who will
expose this innovation, and uproot it with the truth. This is
from the completeness of the proof in the statement of
Allah, Blessed and Exalted is He:

4 Verily W e: It is We Who have sent down the Dhikr
and surely, We will guard it (from corruption) } (A lHijr 15:9)

Introduction

45

This is from Allah's preservation of this Dhikr. This is also
based on the wisdom of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
because He, Exalted is He, made Muhammad
the last of
the Messengers; so, the message will definitely remain on
the earth; or else, the people would have an excuse before
Allah. So, if the message must remain on the surface of the
earth, it follows that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, based
on His wisdom, raises those who will expose an act of
innovation whenever it is introduced. And this is the case,
and that is why I always tell you: Always endeavor to seek
knowledge, because in the future, if we in this land, are not
armed with the knowledge that is built upon the Book and
the Sunnah, then what has happened to other Islamic lands
will soon happen to us. Now, this land is the target of the
enemies of Islam, against which they focus, and upon
which they direct all of their tactics, so that they can lead its
people astray. That is why you have to arm yourselves
with knowledge, such that you have clarity in the case of
your religion, and you can struggle against the enemies of
Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, with your tongues and
pens.
All these innovations became widespread after the era of
the Companions. So the Companions, may Allah be
pleased with them, were not researching into these matters,
because they received and understood the Book and the
Sunnah based on their apparent meanings, and based upon
what the Fitrah dictates, and the healthy Fitrah is always
healthy.
But these innovators came to introduce their innovations
into the religion of Allah, Exalted is He, either due to their
lack of knowledge, or their inadequate understanding, or
their evil intentions; so, they corrupted the world with the
innovations they introduced. But we have said: Indeed,

46

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Allah, Exalted is He, in His Wisdom, His Praise, His Favor
and His Grace - there is no innovation that will be
introduced except that Allah raises against it, those who
will uproot it and expose it.
Among those who have extensively clarified and exposed
innovation, is Shaikh Al-Isldm, Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah
have mercy upon him. I beseech Allah to gather myself and
you altogether with him in the Gardens of bliss.
This man — whom Allah has benefited others by, with the
favors He bestowed upon him, blessing this Ummah with
his like — has written this booklet on creed; as I said, in
response to the request of one of the judges of Wasit, who
had complained to him about the innovations among the
people, so, he requested him to write this creed, which he
wrote in response to his request.

C om m encing books w ith the B a s m a l a h is the
practice of all authors, emulating therewith the Book
of Allah; since He revealed the Basmalah in the
beginning of each Surah (Chapter), and, in conformity
with the Sunnah of the Messenger (#|).

Moreover, the I'rab (syntax) of the Basmalah, clarifying its
meaning, and what it refers to, has been discussed by many
(Translation note) That is; the saying - Bismillaah ar-Rahman
ar-Rahim - meaning; in the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the
Merciful.

48

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

people. The best of what has been said regarding that, is
that it refers to a verb, which is omitted, coming later, and
is related to the context. So, if you were to say it before
eating, the implication would be: "In the Name of Allah, I
eat," and if it is before reading, the implication would be:
"In the Name of Allah, I read."
We consider it (the reference) to be a verb, because actions are
based upon verbs, not nouns. And similarly, verbs imply
actions, without any condition, while nouns do not imply
action, except with a condition, because actions are based
upon verbs, while they are a branch of (the meaning of) nouns.
Furthermore, we consider that it (the referenced verb)
comes later because of two beneficial reasons:
The first: Restriction. Because advancing that which is
done implies a restriction. Thus, (the saying of) "in the
Name of Allah I read," implies: "I do not read except in
the Name of Allah."
The second: Starting on the right side with the Name of
Allah, Glorious is He and the Most High.[1]
And, we consider it to be specific. Because what is specific
better indicates the meaning than what is general. Since we
could say that the indication is "In the Name of Allah, I
start." But, "in the Name of Allah I start" does not indicate
a specific meaning. However, "in the Name of Allah I
read" is specific; and what is specific better indicates the
meaning, than what is general.

[1'

(Translation note) That is; since Arabic is read from right to
left, and here, the action is initiated in the Name of Allah,
which is written first, on the right, then after it, meaning left
of it, comes the verb.

Commentary On The Introductory Notes.

"A llah" is a proper noun that is used for Allah Himself, the
Mighty and Sublime. None can be named with it other than
Him. It means the Ma'luh (Deified One), that is; He Who is
worshipped with love and veneration. It is a derivation according to the preferred view - based upon His, the Most
High, statement:

4And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth, He
knows what you conceal and what you reveal4 (AlAn'dm 6:3)
This is because 'in the heavens' refers back to with the Word
of Majesty (the Name Allah). So it means He is the Ma'luh
(Deified One), both in the heavens, and on the earth.
❖

"A r-R ahm an ” means the Possessor of Extensive Mercy.
Because in the Arabic Language, the Fa'Ian form
indicates extensiveness and fullness. As it is said: "A
man is Ghadban (meaning angry - in the Fa'ldn form),
when he is filled up with anger.

❖

"A r-R ahim ” is a name that indicates the action (of
bestowing mercy), because it is in the Fa'il form but
with the meaning of the doer. So it indicates the action.

Hence, "A r-R ahm an a r-R a h lm ” will together imply that
Allah's Mercy is extensive, and that it reaches creatures.
This is what is some scholars have indicated when they say
that Ar-Rahmam refers to Mercy in general, while ArRahman refers to a Mercy that is specific for the believers.
Therefore, since Allah's Mercy for the disbelievers is
specific to this world only, it is as if there is no mercy for
them. Because in the Hereafter, when they ask Allah to
remove them from the Fire, appealing to Allah, the Most
High, by His Lordship, and confessing against themselves:

}O u r Lord! Bring us out o f this; if ever we return (to
evil), then indeed we shall be unjust/wrongdoers.} (AlMu'minun 23:107)
They will not meet Mercy, but justice. Then, Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, will say to them:

4 Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not
to M e!} (Al-Mu'minun 23:108)

The greatest of all the favors that Allah favored His
Creatures with is sending the Messengers, by which there
is guidance for the creatures. That is why the author says:
"Praise be to Allah, Who sent His Messenger with guidance and
the religion o f truth."
What is intended by 'the Messenger' here is the class of the
Messengers, since all the M essengers were sent with
guidance and the religion of truth. However, he whom
Allah has completed the Messengership with is Muhammad
( 0 ) , because Allah sealed (all) the Prophets by him, and
completed the building with him. As the Prophet ( 0 )
described himself in relation to the (other) Messengers; like a
man who built palace and completed it, with the exception of
the place of a brick. Thus, the people would come to that
palace and be amazed with it, except for the place of that
(missing) brick. He said: "I am indeed the brick; and I am
indeed the last of (all) the Prophets.''111 ( 0 .

actions. So, an example of it being used for actions, is
the saying of the Most High:

iT ru ly , Ad-Din (the religion) with Allah is Islam# (Al
'Imran 3:19)
An example of it being used for reward, is the saying of the
Most High:

4 And what will make you know what the Day o f AdDin (Recompense) is?# (Al-Infitar 82:17)
Furthermore, the truth is the opposite of falsehood, and it that is the truth - includes bringing about good and warding
off evil, in the rulings (of Shari'ah) and the information.
❖

C oncerning his statement: "to make it/him prevail
('Liyuzhirahu') over all religion": the letter "Lam" here
is for justification. And the meaning of "Liyuzhirahu" is
to exalt it. For Az-Zuhur (prevail) means exalted, as in
the 'Zahr (back) of the riding animal is the top of it.
Also, the 'Zahr of the earth is its surface. As the Most
High says:

4And if Allah were to punish men fo r that which they
earned, He would not leave a moving creature on the
surface o f the earthy (Fdtir 35:45)
As for the (pronoun) "Ha"' in "Yuzhirahu", does it refer
back to the Messenger or Din?
If this pronoun refers to the "religion of truth," then
whoever fights for the religion of truth shall become

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

53

exalted. For Allah says: 4 to make it/him prevail
('Liyuzhirahu')'^, so this religion shall prevail over all
other religions, and over he who has no religion; of
course making it exalted over them is more obvious. This
is because the one who doesn't have a religion is more
evil than he who practices false religions. Hence, the
religion of Islam shall triumph over all religions whose
people claim that they are upon the truth, and as far as
other than them, then it is more obviously so.
Moreover, if the pronoun refers to the Messenger (*g) then
(it means that) Allah shall elevate His Messenger, because
he champions the religion of truth.
Whichever one it refers to, (the most important thing is
that) whoever holds on to this religion of truth, shall
become triumphant and exalted; and whoever seeks honor
through other than it, then he has sought humiliation.
Because there is neither triumph, nor honor and respect,
except through the religion of truth. For this reason, O
brothers, I am calling you to hold on to the Din of Allah
openly and secretly, in your worship, morals and manners.
Also, inviting others to it, until the Millah (creed) is firm
and the Ummah becomes upright.
❖

Concerning his statement: "and Allah is sufficient (‘wa
Kafa Billahi') as a w itness": The people of language say:
that the letter "Ba"' here is extra. It is to beautify the
pronunciation and to intensify the sufficiency. Also, its
root meaning is '"w a Kafd Allah.'"

The author cited an Ayah,m and if anybody asks: "W hat is
I1'

(Translation note) Meaning, the author's statement: "W ho sent
His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make
it prevail over all religion and Allah is Sufficient as a Witness"
which is taken from Allah's saying in Surat Al-Fath (48:27).

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

the relationship between the statements 'Allah is sufficient
as a witness' and 'so that He can make it prevail over every
other religion'?''
It would be said: The relationship is clear. This is because
this Prophet (#|) came and invited people saying:
"W hoever obeys me, shall enter into Jannah (Paradise),
and whoever disobeys me, shall enter into the F ire."^
Also, he was saying in the language which speaks for itself:
"W hoever obeys me, I shall keep peace with, and whoever
disobeys me, I shall wage a war against." He waged wars
against people because of this religion, and made their
blood, wealth, women and offspring lawful, and he was
supported in that and became victorious. He was the victor
and never the loser. So this is how he became established
on the earth; that is, Allah's establishing His Messenger on
the earth is actually a testimony from Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, that he was truthful and that his religion is
true. This is because everyone who concocted a lie against
Allah, ended up in humiliation, vanity and nothingness.
Look at those who falsely claimed Prophethood, what was
their end? They were destroyed and forgotten, such as
Musailimah Al-Kadhdhab, Al-Aswad Al-'Ansi and other
than them, who falsely claimed Prophethood. All of them
vanished! The falsehood of their claim became evident.
They were denied correctness and rightness; whereas the
reverse is the case regarding the Prophet (gg), his D aw ah
(invitation) lasts until now, praise be to Allah. And we ask
111 As is reported by Al-Bukhar! (7280), from Abu Hurairah,
may Allah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allah
( j g ) said: "All my people will enter Jannah, except those who
refuse." It was said, "O Messenger of Allah, who will
refuse?" and he ( s g ) said: "H e who obeys me will enter
Jannah, and he who disobeys me has refused."

Allah to keep you, and us, firm upon it. His Da'wah
remains until now, and (will remain) firm and established
until the establishment of the Hour. Up till now, his Da'wah
still makes lawful the blood and wealth of any disbeliever
who opposes it; so are their women and offspring.^ This
is a practical testimony. Allah never punished, disgraced or
denied him. That is why it came after his statement: "to
make it prevail over all other religions."

Concerning his saying: "And I testify that La Ilaha Ilia
Allah alone, He has no partners, acknowledging it, and with

The Commentary
❖ "I testify" meaning I acknowledge with my heart,
[11 Based on the report of Al-Bukhari (25) and Muslim (22), from
Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him: That the
Messenger of Allah (sg) said: "I have been commanded to
fight the people until they testify to La ilaha ilia Allah (there is
no deity worthy of worship except Allah) and that
Muhammad is Allah's Messenger, perform Salah and give
Zakah. If they do that, they have kept their blood and their
wealth safe from me - except for a right of Islam - and their
reckoning is with Allah."

pronouncing with my tongue. Because the testimony is
a pronouncement and informing about what is in the
heart. When you bear witness for a person against
another person before the judge, you are expressing
with the tongue what is in the heart. Testimony was
chosen instead of acknowledgement, because the basis
of testimony is taken from the presence of something,
meaning attending and seeing the thing. It is like one is
disclosing what is in one's heart while expressing it
with one's tongue, as if one has witnessed the incident
with one's eyes.

“La Ilaha Ilia Allah'' means none truly deserves to be

The Commentary

first "I testify.”
❖

"Muhammad” is the son of 'Abdullah bin 'AbdulMuttalib Al-QurashI Al-HashimI, from the progeny of
Isma'il bin Ibrahim, who is of the most honorable
descent.

This honorable Prophet is the servant and Messenger of
Allah who worshiped Allah most among all people, and he
is the strongest regarding the establishment of His worship.
He ( j g ) was used to observing prayer in the night until his
feet would become swollen, and it would be said to him:
"W hy are you doing all of this, while Allah has forgiven
your previous and future sin s?" He w ould reply:
"Shouldn't I be a grateful servant?"^1' This is because
Allah, the Most High, praised the grateful servant, when
He said, regarding Nuh:

4 Verily, he was a grateful slave 4 (Al-Isra' 17:3)
The Prophet ( $ g ) therefore aspired to reach this height, and
to worship Allah as He deserves to be worshipped. Hence,
he was the person with the most Taqwa among the people,
the one who feared Allah most among the people, and the
one who craved most for that which is with Allah, the Most
High.
So, he is the servant of Allah; which implies that he can
neither benefit nor harm, neither himself, nor others. He
does not have any right to Lordship at all. Rather, he was a
servant in need of Allah, wanting of Him, asking Him,
supplicating to Him, hoping from Him, and fearing Him.
Rather, Allah ordered him to publicize and specifically

The summary of the matter is that Muhammad (|g) is a
servant of Allah. And this servitude implies that he does

not have any right, at all, in any of the affairs of Lordship.
If this is the confirmed status of Muhammad ($g) what do
you think of other servants of Allah who are (all) definitely
below him? They can never benefit nor harm, neither
themselves, nor others. This will make clear the impru­
dence of those who call on those whom they consider as
saints, instead of calling upon Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime.
❖

His saying: "and His M essen ger": This is also a
designation that should not be used for anybody after
Allah's Messenger (j| |), because he is the seal (end) of
the Prophets. He is the Messenger of Allah who
reached a place that had never been reached by any
human being. Rather, not even by any Angel from
what we know, except, by Allah, those who carry the
Throne. He reached above the seventh heaven, and
heard the scratching of the Pens of Al-Qada' (the
Decree ),111 with which Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
decrees regarding His creatures. From what we know,
nobody ever reached this station.

And Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, spoke to him directly,
without an intermediary, and sent him to all the creation,
and supported him with marvelous signs that no human
being or Messenger before him had; that is, this Magnifi­
cent Qur'an. For indeed, this Qur'an does not have an equal
in any of the signs given to the earlier Prophets. Hence,
Allah, the Most High, says:

[11 Based on the report of Al-Bukhari (349), that Ibn Abbas, may
Allah be pleased with him, and Abu Habbah Al-Ansari, may
Allah be pleased with him, both said that the Prophet (sg)
said: "Then, I was taken up (into the heavens) until I reached
the level where I heard the squeaking of the Pens.''

have sent down to you the Book (the Qur'an) which is
recited to them?$ (Al-'Ankabut 29:50-51)
This suffices from all things; but (only) for he who has a
heart, and can hear and witness. As for the adversary, he
would say as was said by those (adversaries) before him:
"These are but tales of the ancients."
In short, Muhammad (#|) is Allah's Messenger, and the seal
(end) of the Prophets. Allah ended Prophethood with him,
and Messengership as well. Because when Prophethood has
ended, which is more general than Messengership, then
Messengership, which is particular, has also ended. There­
fore, the Messenger of Allah (ggjj) is the seal (end) of the
Prophets.

May the Salah o f Allah be upon him, his Al, and his

•

His saying: ''May the Salah o f Allah be upon him, his Al,
and his Companions, and Sallam with abundant Taslim."

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

61

The Commentary
❖

Concerning the m eaning of ”May the Salah of Allah be
upon him”, the best that is said regarding this, is what
Abu Al-'Aliy ah, may Allah have mercy upon him, said:
'Allah's Salah upon His Messenger is His praise for him
in the most exalted assembly (the assembly of the
Angels)./[1]

As for those who interpreted 'Salah’ as 'mercy', then their
statement is weak; since mercy is for everyone. That is why
the scholars are in agreement (consensus) concerning the
permissibility of saying: "So and so, may Allah have mercy
upon him,” and they differ regarding the permissibility of
saying: "So and so, May the Salah of Allah be upon him.”
And this proves that 'Salah' is different from 'mercy.'
Besides, Allah, the M ost High, has said:

iT h ey are those upon whom are the Salahs from their
Lord, and m ercy} (Al-Baqarah 2:157)
(The use of) conjunction implies variance. Therefore, Salah
is more specific than mercy. Hence, the Salah of Allah upon
his Messenger is His praise for him in the most exalted
assembly.
❖

Also his statement: "And upon his A l": and his "A/"
here means those who follow him in his religion. This is

[11 Reported by Al-Bukharl, from Abu Al-'Aliyah in the Tafsir of
Surat Al-Ahzab, the chapter: "Indeed Allah and His Angels
send Salah upon the Prophet (prior to number 4797). See Fath
(Al-Bari) 8:532. And its chain was connected by Al-Qadl
Isma'Il bin Ishaq Al-Jahdaml in Fadlis-Salat ‘Alan-Nabi (jg)
(95) with a Hasan chain of transmission as was said by Shaikh
Al-Albaru.

62

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

when "Al" is mentioned alone or with the Compa­
nions, then it refers to all his followers upon his
religion, since he was sent (as Messenger) until the Day
of Resurrection.
What proves that "Al" refers to those who follow his
religion, is the statement of the Most High regarding the Al
of Fir'awn:

iT h e Fire; they are exposed to it, morning and
afternoon, and on the Day when the Hour will be
established (it will be said to the A ngels): "Cause Al o f
Fir'awn to enter the severest torment!"$ (Ghdfir 40:46)
Meaning those who followed his religion.
However, if it is coupled with the Atba' (followers), such as
saying: 'his Al and his Atba';' then the Al are those believers
from among Al Al-Bait (the Household); meaning the
Household of the Messenger (5§g).
And Shaikh Al-lslam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have Mercy
upon him, did not mention the Atba' here; he (only) said:
"his Al and his Companions.” Thus, we say: His Al are
those who follow him in his religion, while his Companions
are those who met the Prophet (*g), believing in him, and
died upon that.
Joining the Companions to the Al here, is a way of joining
the specific to the general; because Companionship is more
specific than the general following.
❖

Concerning his saying: “"Sallam" abundant Taslim."

In the word "Sallam" there is freedom from harm and
danger, while in the word Salah there is the attainment of

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

63

various kinds of good. Therefore, in this phrase, the author
combined asking Allah, the Most High, to provide various
kinds of good for His Prophet - the most special of which is
praising him among the most exalted assembly - along with
warding off evil from him; and those who followed him.
❖

Concerning his statement: " abundant (Mazida)": it
means extra or additional. What is intended is Taslim
(peace) added to the Salah. So, it is another supplica­
tion, for Salam (peace), after the (supplication) for Salah.

The (meaning of) Messenger according to the people of
knowledge is: He who was given a particular Sharf ah
(Legislative Law) and was ordered to convey it.
He ($fc) was made a Prophet by:
i
iR e a d !) (Al-'Alaq 96:1)
And he was made a Messenger by (Surah) Al-Muddaththir
Thus, by the statement of the Most High:

^Read! In the Name o f your Lord, Who has created (all
that exists)^
To His statement:

4 Has taught man that which he knew not^ (Al-'Alaq
96:1-5)
He became a Prophet.

the establishment o f the Hour, (that is) the People o f the

The Commentary
❖

"So, this is the I'tiqad": "So, this" is a demonstrative
pronoun, that must necessarily indicate something that
exists. (For example,) whenever I say: 'this', I must be
referring to something tangible (and) apparent. But here,
the author had written the (introductory) address before
the book, and before this book was brought to light to the
visible world; so how do we harmonize that?

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

65

I say: The scholars say that if the author had written the
book before the introduction and (introductory) address,
then (clearly) what is being referred to does exist, and is
tangible; (thus,) there is no conflict therein. But if he had
not written the book, then the author is referring to what he
had in mind about the meanings which he was to write in
the book.
I have a third possibility, which is that the author said this
in consideration of the condition of the one he is
addressing, who is not addressed in such manner, until
after the book had been brought to light and published.
Thus, it is as if he (the author) was saying "this, which is
before you, is so and so.” Therefore, these are three angles
of interpretation.
❖

Linguistically, “I'tiqad" is the Ifti'al form of the word
Al-'Aqd, which means "binding” and "tying.” But with
the people of terminology, it means a determined
judgement of the mind. It is said: "I firmly believe such
(Ttiqadtu kadha)," meaning I have determined it in my
heart (and it is definite). Thus, it is determined
judgement of the mind. So, if it agrees with reality, it
is correct. But if it opposes reality, it is invalid.

Therefore, our belief that Allah is One God is correct; while
the belief of the Christians that Allah is one of three is
wrong. For it opposes reality. Also, the relationship
between that and the linguistic meaning is obvious. That
is because he who firmly believes something in his heart, is
as if he has bound and tied it to the heart in a way that it
does not bolt away.
❖

" Al-Firqah" with Kasra on the (letter) F a , means AtTa if ah (the group). Allah, the Most High, said:

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

66

4 For there should separate from every division o f them a
group$ (At-Tawbah 9:122)
But, Al-Furqah with Damma (on the letter Fa'), then it is
taken from Al-Iftirdq (the division).
❖

"An-Ndjiyah (the saved)” : is a subject's noun, from Naja
(saved), when he is rescued. It is, safe and secure from
Bida' (innovation) in this world, and safe from the Fire

The support for this is that the Prophet (s&) said:

(^g) and his Companions were (upon), then he is safe from
Bida' (innovations). (As for) "A ll of them shall enter the
Fire, except one" then that one is safe from the Fire.
Therefore, the salvation here, is from Bida' (innovations) in
this world, and from the Fire in the Hereafter.
❖

" Al-Mansurah (aided) until the establishment o f the Hour
the author expresses this in conformity with the Hadith,
wherein the Prophet (sfe;) said

"A group o f my Ummah shall continue to be manifest
(Zahirin) upon the truth.
The meaning of Zuhur (manifest) here is victory, for the
saying of the Most High:

4So We gave power to those who believed against their
enemies, and they became the v ic t o r io u s ( A s - S a jf
61:14)
Allah, His Angels and the believers aid it. Consequently,
they shall remain supported till the establishment of the
Hour; supported by Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, the
Angels and His believers; the hum an can even be
supported by the Jinn. The Jinn will support him and
intimidate his enemy.

It is reported from a number of the Companions, may Allah
be pleased with them, and it is Mutawatir as it is clearly
stated by Shaildi Al-lslam Ibn Taymiyyah in Iqtida' As-Sirat
(1:69), Al-KattanI in Nazm Al-M utanathir (93), Az-Zubaidi in
Laqt Al-Ldli' Al-Mutanathirah (68), and Al-Alban! in Salat Al'Idain (39-40).

68

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

❖

"Until the establishment o f the H our": meaning until the
Day of Judgment. Thus, it is to remain supported until
the establishment of the Hour.

Here a problem arises. The Messenger (#g) has informed
(us) that the Hour will occur upon the most evil of
creation;^ and it will not come about until "Allah, Allah”
is not (even) said .[21
How do we harmonize between this and his saying: "until
the establishment o f the Hour"?
The response is, that it be said: What is intended (by "until
the establishment o f the Hour") is close to the establishment of
the Hour; based on the Hadith in which he said: "Until the
order of Allah comes. " [3] Or, until the establishment of the
Hour, meaning their hour, which is their death. For he who
dies, his (time of Judgment) has occurred. However, the
first interpretation is closer (to being correct); they will,
thus remain supported close to the establishment of the
Hour.
We only resort to this Ta'wil (interpretation) based on the
evidence, since Ta'wil (interpretation) based upon proof is
allowed, because all of it (the text and the implication) is
from Allah.
❖

"Tlte People o f the Sunnah and the Jama'ah": He (the
author) attributed them to the Sunnah because they
adhere to it, and to the Jama'ah (congregation) because
they are agreed upon it (the Sunnah).

Reported by Muslim (2949) from Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

69

If you were to say: How could he say: "The People o f the Sunnah
and the Jama'ah" since they, themselves, are a Jama'ah
(congregation)? So, how could a thing be ascribed to itself?
The response would be that the word Jama'ah - a common
noun - primarily means a gathering. It was transferred to
mean people who are gathered together. Hence, the
meaning of the People of Sunnah and Jama'ah becomes:
the People of Sunnah and the gathering. They are being
referred to as the People of Sunnah because they adhere to
it; and they are being referred to as the People of the
Jama'ah (community) because they are gathered on it
(Sunnah).
For this reason, this group does not divide as the people of
Bida' (innovations) do. We find the people of Bida'
(innovations), like the Jahmiyyah, the Mu'tazilah, the Rafidah
and others from the people of Ta'til[1] are divided. As for
this group, it is united upon the truth. Even though some
disagreements may occur among them, yet they are
harmless ones. It is a disagreement where no one accuses
the other of having gone astray by it; their chest is widened
for it.[2] Besides, they have differed in matters that relate to
creed.
For example, did the Prophet (#|) see his Lord with his eyes
or not? And similarly, does the punishment of the grave
affect both the body and the soul, or the soul only? And
issues like these over which they differ, but they are
considered branch matters in relation to the fundamentals,
and they are not considered fundamentals. Yet, with that,
^

(Translation note): Those who suspend Allah's attributes
from their meaning.
[21 (Translation note): Meaning, they will make exceptions for
minor disagreements.

70

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

while they differ, they never accuse the other of having
gone astray, unlike the people of Bida' (innovations).
Therefore, they are gathered upon the Sunnah, so they are
the People of the Sunnah and the Jama ah.
Furthermore, it is known from the author's statement, may
Allah have mercy upon him, that he did not include among
them whoever opposed them in their path. So the Ash'aris,
for example, and the Maturidis are not included among
People of the Sunnah and Jama ah in this topic. Because they
oppose them in what the Prophet 0 ) and his Companions
followed, regarding accepting the attributes of Allah,
Glorious is He and Exalted, upon their realities. And for
this reason, whoever says (the following) is mistaken: 'The
People of the Sunnah and the Jama ah are three: The Salafis,
the Ash'aris, and the Maturidis.' This is a mistake; we say:
How can they all be People of the Sunnah, while they
oppose one another? What is there after the truth but
falsehood?! And how can they be from the People of the
Sunnah, when each of them refutes the other?! This is not
possible, unless it is possible to unite two opposites, then
yes. Otherwise, then there is no doubt that one of them is
Sahib As-Sunnah (a person of the Sunnah); then which one?
The Ash'aris? The Maturidis? The Salafis? We say whoever
agrees with the Sunnah, then he is a person (Sahib) of the
Sunnah and whoever opposes the Sunnah; then he is not a
person (Sahib) of the Sunnah. So therefore we say: The Salaf
are the People of the Sunnah and the Jamd'ah, and this
description will never be true about other than them, and
since words carry meanings, then let us reflect; how can we
name those who oppose the Sunnah with "the People of
Sunnah"?\ It is not possible! How is it possible that we say
about three opposing paths that they are united?! So where
is the agreement?! So the People of Sunnah and the Jamd'ah

Day of Judgment, when he is upon the path of the Prophet

The Commentary
The Prophet (#|) established this creed for us in reply to
Jibril, when he asked the Prophet (#;): "W hat is Islam?"
"W hat is iman?" "W hat is Thsan?" "W hen will the Hour
be?" Regarding Iman, he replied: "That you believe in
Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day
and Al-Qadar, its good and its bad ."[11
❖

" F a ith in A l l a h : ” As for the m eaning of Iman
linguistically; many people say that Iman it is At-Tasdiq
(trust). As a result, 'I trust' and 'I believe' mean the
same thing linguistically. Also, we have earlier men­
tioned in the commentary on the Qur'an, that this

I1!

Reported by Muslim (8) from the narration of 'Umar bin AlKhattab, may Allah be pleased with him.

72

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

statement is incorrect. Rather, Itndn linguistically means
approving something out of a trust in it, due to the
evidence that you say: "Amantu hi kadha (I believe in
this)” and " Aqrartu hi kadha (I approve of this)” and
" Sadaqtu fulanan (I trust So-and-so).” And you do not
say: " Amantu fulanan (I have faith, So-and-so).”
Therefore, Iman is more comprehensive than mere trust. It
is approving and acknowledgem ent, that necessitate
accepting the narrations and submission to the rulings.
This is Iman; but as for just having faith that Allah exists this is not Iman - not until it leads you to accepting the
narrations and submitting to the rulings. If not, then it is
not Itndn.
Having Im an in Allah includes four things:
1. The belief in the existence of Allah, Glorious is He and
Exalted.
2. The belief in His sole (right of) Rububiyyah Lordship.
3. The belief in His sole (right of) Uluhiyyah (divinity).
4. The belief in His Names and Attributes.
Im an will not be established except with (all of) that.
So, whoever does not believe in the existence of Allah, then
he is not a believer. Whoever believes in the existence of
Allah, and not in His sole right of Lordship, then he is not a
believer. Whoever believes in Allah and His sole right of
Lordship, but not in His sole right of Uluhiyah (divinity),
then he is not a believer. Whoever believes in Allah, His
sole right of Lordship, and Uluhiyah (divinity), but does not
believe in His Names and Attributes, then he is not a
believer. Even if there is in the last (category) those who are
completely stripped of Iman, and therein whose Iman is
only incomplete.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

Having Faith in His existence:
If someone says: "W hat is the proof of the existence of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime?"
We reply that the evidence for Allah's existence are: The
'Aql (intellect), the senses, and the Shari'ah. All three prove
the existence of Allah. If you like, you can add the Fitrah
(innate disposition). Therefore, the proofs of Allah's
existence are four: The 'Aql, the senses, the Fitrah and the
Shari'ah. Also, we have mentioned the textual evidences
(Shan ah) last, not because it is not worthy of being
mentioned first; rather because we are addressing he who
does not believe in the Shari'ah.
As for the evidences from intellect, we ask: Do all these
creatures exist by themselves, or by chance?
If you say they exist by themselves; this is rationally
impossible, it was first non-existent, so how can it exist
when it was non-existent?! The non-existent is nothing until
it exists, then, it is not able to bring itself into existence.
If you also say they exist by chance; then we say this is also
impossible O denying one! All the things produced, like
planes, rockets, vehicles and other forms of machinery, do
they exist by chance? He would (definitely) reply that this
is not possible. (If that is not possible); in the same way, it is
not possible, whatsoever, that birds, mountains, the sun,
the moon, the stars, the trees, coal, sand, the seas and other
than that, exist by chance.
It was said, that a group of As-Sumaniyyah, who are from
the people of India, came to Imam Abu Hamfah, may Allah
have mercy upon him. So, they debated w ith him
regarding the existence of the Creator, the Mighty and
Sublime. Imam Abu Hanifah, a very intelligent scholar,
made an appointment with them, saying that they should

74

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

come back after a day or two. So, they came back; (and)
said: "W hat do you say?" He said: "I thought about a ship
full of freight and provisions, which sailed the sea, docked,
unloaded what it carried, and left, and it also had no
captain and no dock workers."
They replied: "You thought of this?!" He replied: "Y es."
They said: "Then, you have no intellect! Is it imaginable
that a ship sail without a captain, unload itself and leave?!
This is unintelligible!' He said: "H ow is it that you can not
comprehend this, yet you reason that these heavens, the
sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the
animals and people, all exist without a M aker?!" They
realized that this man was addressing them by using their
own sense of reason, and that they were incapable of giving
any reply to this nor its meaning.
A Bedouin Arab was asked: "W ith what did you know
your Lord?" He replied: "The tracks indicate the direction
of the journey, while the dung indicates a camel. So,
heavens possessing of such towers, and the earth with such
paths, and the sea with such waves - would that not
indicate (the existence of) the All-Hearing and the AllSeeing?"
For this reason, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said:

4W ere they created by nothing, or were they themselves
the creators?$ (At-Tur 52:35)
Therefore, intellect, firmly and unequivocally, indicates the
existence of Allah.
As for the evidence from the senses concerning Allah's
existence; then indeed the human calls upon Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, saying: "O my Lord!" asking for

something, then his prayer is answered. This is a sensible
proof. He himself (the one who denies the existence of
Allah, the Most High) did not call on anyone except Allah,
and Allah granted his request. He witnessed that with his
own eyes! We also hear about those who have past, and
those in our time, whose requests Allah has granted.
While the Messenger ( 0 ) was delivering a sermon to the
people on Friday, a Bedouin entered the Masjid, and said:
"The wealth has been destroyed and the roads have been
cut off! Ask Allah to provide rain for us." Anas said: "By
Allah, there was no cloud in the sky, not even a Qaz'ah meaning a piece of a cloud — and there was no house nor a
home between us and Sal' — a mountain in Al-Madinah,
from whose direction clouds come -... Immediately after the
supplication of the Messenger ( 0 ) , there came a cloud like
a shield, which rose up to the heavens, spread, thundered,
issued lightening, and it started raining. Thus, the
Messenger ( 0 ) did not come descend (from the Minbar)
except with rain dripping from his beard ( 0 ) . ” m
This is an obvious occurrence, which proves the existence
of the Creator based upon the senses.
Incidents like this abound in the Qur'an; for example:
o

4,And (remember) Ayyub, when he cried to his Lord:
"Verily, distress has seized me, and You are the Most
Merciful o f all those who show m ercy.” So We answered

^

Reported by Al-Bukhan (1033), and Muslim (897), from the
narration of Anas, may Allah be pleased with him.

76

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

As for the proof from the Fitrah; indeed, many of people,
whose Fitrah has not deviated, believe in the existence of
Allah. Even animals without intelligence believe in the
existence of Allah. And the story of the ant, which was
narrated from Sulaiman (>&0), (is an example). He came out
to beg (Allah) for water. Then, he found an ant lying down
on its back, raising its legs up toward the heavens saying:
"O Allah, I am a creature from among Your creatures, do
not deny us your provision of water.” He then said (to his
followers): "G o back, water was asked to be provided to
you by the supplication of another (creature).'^1’
Subsequently, the Fitrah is inclined to knowing Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, and to single Him out.
Allah, the Most High, indicated that in His statement:

x ( * * ot
4And (remember) when your Lord brought forth from
the Children o f Adam, from their loins, their seed and
made them testify as to themselves (saying): "Am I not
your Lord?" They said: "Yes! We testify," lest you
should say on the Day o f Judgm ent: "Verily, we have
been unaware o f this." Or lest you should s a y : "It was
only our fathers aforetime, who took others as partners
in worship along with Allah, and we were (merely their)
descendants after them$ (Al-A'rdf 7:172-173)

[11 In Ad-Durr Al-Manthur As-Suyuti has attributed it to Ibn Abi
Shaibah, Ahmad in Az-Zuhd and Ibn Abi Hatim, from Abu
As-Siddlq An-Najl. See Ijtima' Al-Juyush by Ibn al-Qayyim
( 221- 228).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

77

This verse proves that man is inclined by his Fitrah to
testify to the existence of Allah and His Lordship. Whether
we say that Allah brought them out of Adam's back and
made them testify, or we say that this is what Allah, the
Most High, has put acknowledgment of this in their Fitrah.
Hence, this is a (clear) proof that man knows his Lord by
his Fitrah.
These are four evidences for the existence of Allah,
Glorious is He and Exalted.
As for the evidences of the Sharfah, then whatever the
Messengers came with from Allah's Shari ahs, containing all
of what is beneficial for creation, it also proves that He
Who sent it is a Lord, M erciful and Wise. This is
particularly so regarding this Majestic Qur'an, making it
impossible for mankind and Jinns to produce its like.
❖

"A nd His A ngels": Al-Mala'ikah (Angels) is plural for
M al’ak. The origin of Mal'ak is Ma'lak, it being from AlAlukah. Al-Alukah, linguistically, means "the message."
Allah, the Most High, said:

$ Who

made the Angels,
(Fatir 35:1)

Hence, the Angels are part of the unseen world. Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, created them from light, and made
them obedient and subservient to Him. Each of them has
specific functions assigned to him by Allah. We know of
some of their functions:
Firstly: Jibrll, who is entrusted with the Wahl (Divine
Revelation). He descends with it from Allah, the Most
High, to the Messengers.
Secondly: Israfil, who is entrusted with the responsibility

78

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

for blowing the Sur (Trumpet). He is also one of the bearers
of the Throne.
Thirdly: Mika'il, who is entrusted with the rainfall and
plant life.
These three are entrusted with what brings life. Jibrll was
entrusted with the Wahl, wherein lies the life of hearts,
Mlka'il is entrusted with rainfall and plants, wherein lies
the life of the earth, and Israfil is entrusted with the
blowing of the Sur (Trumpet), wherein lies the life of the
(dead) bodies on the Promised Day.
This is why the Prophet (#;) used to petition Allah by His
Lordship, mentioning them (the Angels) in his opening
supplication during the voluntary night prayer. He would
say: "O Allah, the Lord of Jibrll, Mika'il and Israfil! The
Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Knower of the
unseen and the seen! You shall judge among your servants
regarding that which they differed. Guide me by your
permission to the truth regarding that which is differed
over. You certainly guide whomever you will, to the
Straight P ath ."[1] This is the supplication that he used to
say during the voluntary night prayer, mentioning them
while petitioning Allah by His Lordship.
We also know that among them are those who are
entrusted with the taking the souls of humans or anything
that has a soul. They are Malak Al-Mawt (the Angel of
death) and his deputies. He (Malak Al-Mawt) is not to be
referred to as Tzra'il, because it is not confirmed from the
Prophet (sg) that this is his name. Allah says:

[1) Reported by Muslim (770) from 'Aishah, may Allah be
pleased with her.

illn til when death approaches one o f you , Our
Messengers (Angel o f death and his assistants) take his
soul, and they never neglect their duty}. (Al-An'am
6:61)
He, the Most High, also said:

} S a y : "The Angel o f death, who is set over you, will
take your sou ls} (As-Sajdah 32:11)
And he, the Mighty and Exalted, said:
(jy-t
} I t is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time o f
their death} (Az-Zumar 39:42)
There is no contradiction between these three verses, for the
Angels take the soul. Because when Malak Al-Mawt seizes
the soul from the body, other Angles will be present with
him. If the deceased is an inhabitant of Jannah (Paradise),
they will have perfume and a shroud from Jannah with
them, they will take this blessed soul, and wrap it in the
shroud, and ascend therewith to Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, until it is between the two Hands of Allah. He
would then say (to them): "W rite the record of my servant
in the Tlliyyin and return it to the earth.” Thus, the soul will
then be returned to the body for the trial (of the grave, and
would then be asked): "W ho is your Lord? What is your
religion? Who is your Prophet?”
But, if the deceased is an unbeliever - we seek refuge in
Allah (from that) - then, the Angels would descend with a
shroud and stench from the Fire, take the soul, wrap it in
this shroud, and ascend with it to the heavens; however the
gates of the heavens will be closed before it, then it will be

flung to the earth. Allah, the Most High, says:

4And whoever assigns partners to Allah, it is as if he
had fallen from the sky, and the birds had snatched him,
or the wind had thrown him to a fa r o ff placed (Al-Hajj
22:31)

Allah would later say: "W rite the record of my servant in
the S i j j i n - we ask Allah to protect us.
Those (Angels) are entrusted to take the soul from Malak
Al-Mawt after he takes it out, while Malak Al-Mawt is the
one that removes the soul. Therefore, there is no contra­
diction. Furthermore, Allah is He Who orders this (the
taking of the soul) and as such, He is the One Who takes
the soul in the real sense.
Among them (Angels) are those who travel around on the
earth in search of the gatherings of remembrance (of Allah).
Once they find a circle of knowledge, and remembrance (of
Allah), they sit down.[2]

others. Al-Hakim said: "It is Sahih (authentic) according to
the criteria of the Two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim)"

[21 Based on the report of Al-Bukhari (6408) and Muslim (2689)
from Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, from
the Prophet (sg) who said: "Allah has Angels who go around
the roads in search of the people of remembrance (of Allah).
When they find a people remembering Allah, the Most High,
they call one another - 'Come to your aspirations."' He said:
"So they cover them with their wings, up to the first
heaven.'" The wording is that of Al-Bukhari.

4For each (person), there are Angels in succession,
before and behind him . They guard him by the
Command o f Allahy (Ar-Ra'd 13:11)
Among them (Angels) are those who are in (constant)
bowing and prostration to Allah in the heavens. The
Prophet (#|) said: "The heaven Atat (creak) and it has every
right to creak.” And the A tit is the Sarlr Ar-Rahl (camel's
creaking). Meaning: If there was a heavy load on top of the
camel, you would hear to it a creaking sound due to the
heavy weight of the load. The Prophet ($fe) said: "The
heaven creaks and it has every right to creak. There is no
place that could contain four fingers in the heavens except
that there is an Angel standing, bowing, or prostrating to
Allah therein.” ^ So these Angles cover the vastness of the
heavens.
Thus, regarding Bait Al-M a'mur (the Oft-Frequented
House) that he passed by during the night of Ascension,
the Messenger (jg) said: "Seventy thousand Angels
circumambulate” - or he said "enter” it everyday, and
Reported by Ahmad (5:173), At-Tirmidh! (2312), Ibn Majah
(4190) and Al-Hakim (2:510), from Abu Pharr, may Allah be
pleased with him. And his wording is: "The heaven creaks,
and it has every right to creak. There is no space for four
fingers, except that there is an Angel there, placing its head
in prostration to Allah." The Hadith is referenced by AlAlban! in As-Sahihah (1722).

they would never return to it again ."*11 What this means, is
that the set of seventy thousand Angels that enter today,
are different from those that entered yesterday, and they
will never come back to it again, while still others will
come. This is evidence of the large number of the Angels.
For this fact, Allah, the Most High, said:

inhabitants of the Fire would say:

4 0 Malik (Keeper o f Hell)! Let your Lord make an end

Meaning: Kill us, putting us to death. So they supplicate to
Allah to kill them, because they are experiencing unbear­
able punishment. He will reply:

After then, it will be said to them:

you have a hatred fo r the truth} (Az-Zukhruf 43:78)
What is important (here), is that we must believe in the

Allah be pleased with him, in the story of Al-Isra.

84

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Angels.
And how does one believe in the Angels?
We should believe that they are of the unseen world, not to
be seen; they can also be seen sometimes; although, they
are primarily of the unseen world. They were created from
light, and charged with whatever worship Allah has
charged them with, and they are completely subservient
to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.

4 Who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they
receive from Allah, but do that which they are
commanded} (At-Tahrim 66:6)
We also believe in whatever of their names we know of.
And we believe whatever functions of theirs we know of. It
is obligatory upon us to believe in all of this according to
what we know. (We also believe that) they are physical
beings. The evidence for this is the saying of the Most High:

}W ho made the Angels messengers with wings} (Fatir
35:1)
The Prophet (j||) saw Jibril in his original form, in which he
was created, with six hundred wings covering up the sky^
as opposed to those who say: "They are merely spirits.”
If someone asks: "D o they have intellect?" We will reply (to
such a person): "D o you have intellect?” Nobody will ask
this question except an insane person. For Allah, the Most
High, said (regarding them):

"A nd His B ooks": meaning, His Books which He
revealed to the Messengers.

And for every Messenger there was a Book. Allah, the Most
High, said:
CHj L ic j
4-Indeed We have sent Our Messengers with clear
proofs, and revealed with them the Book and the
Balance4 (Al-Hadid 57:25)
This is evidence that every Messenger was given a Book;
but we do not know all these Books. Rather, we only know:
the Suhuf (Scriptures of) Ibrahim and Musa, the Tawrah,
the Injll, the Zabur and the Qur'an. These are six.
Some say the Suhuf (Scriptures of) Musa are the same as
the Tawrah. While some others say that they are different.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

86

If it is the Tawrah, then it is five. But if they are different,
then it is six. Nonetheless, we believe in all the Books
revealed by Allah to (all) the Messengers. Even if we do not
know them by name, we believe in them as a whole.
❖

"A nd His M essengers": Meaning the Messengers of
Allah. They are those whom Allah revealed the
Shan ahs to and ordered them to convey it. The first
of them is Nuh and the last of them is Muhammad

The proofs that Nuh is the first of them is the saying of the
Exalted:

4 Verily, We have inspired you as We inspired Nuh and
the Prophets after himty (An-Nisa' 4:163)
Meaning, a Wahl (Divine Revelation), like Our Revelation
to Nuh and the Prophets after him; and that is the
Revelation of Messengership.
Also, His saying:

iA n d indeed, We sent Nuh and Ibrahim, and placed in
their offspring Prophethood and Scripture (Book)} (AlHadid 57:26)
iin their offspring4 meaning the offspring of Nuh and
Ibrahim; and those before Nuh cannot be regarded as
being from among his offspring.
As well as, the saying of the Exalted:

4 (So were) the people o f Nuh before them. Verily, they
were a people who were Fasiqin (rebellious and disobe-

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

87

dient to A llah.)} (Adh-Dhariyat 51:46)
We may say: His saying: } before them } refers to what has
been mentioned earlier.
Thus, (there are) three proofs from the Qur'an, which
establish that Nuh is the first of the Messengers.
And from the Sunnah is what was confirmed from the
Hadith of the Shafa'ah (Intercession): "The people of the
station of (standing) will be telling Nuh: 'You are the first
Messenger who Allah sent to the people of the earth .'"[1]
This is clear.
As for Adam, may the Salah and Salam be upon him, he
was a Prophet, and not a Messenger.
As regards Idris, many historians - or most of them - and
some scholars of Tafsir, as well, claim that he was before
Nuh, and he (Idris) was among his (Nuh's) forefathers.
However, this is a very weak view, which the Qur'an and
the Sunnah refute; and what is correct is what we have
mentioned.
The Last of them is Muhammad ($&), due to the saying of
the Exalted:

}B u t he is the Messenger o f Allah and the Last (seal) o f
the Prophets} (Al-Ahzab 33:40)
He did not say: "Last (seal) of the Messengers/' because
when He sealed Prophethood, then it is more obvious that
He sealed Messengership.
If you were to say: "Isa, may the Salah and Salam be upon

88

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

him, will return at the end times;^1' and he is a
Messenger/' what would then be the reply?
We would reply that he is not coming back with a new
Shari'ah. Rather, he would only rule with the Shari'ah of
Prophet (Muhammad ($g).
If somebody says that it is agreed upon that the best of this
Ummah, after its Prophet, is Abu Bakr, and 'Isa shall rule
with the Shan ah of the Prophet ($g). Thus, he ('Isa, peace
be upon him) would (by that) be among his [the Prophet's
(sg)] followers. So, how is it correct that we say that Abu
Bakr is the best of this Ummah after it's Prophet?
Then the answer would be from one of three angles:
Firstly: 'Isa, may the Salah and Salam be upon him, is a
Messenger on his own among the Ulii Al-'Azm (the
Messengers of firm resolve); and comparing between him

111 Based on the report of Imam Ahmad (2921) from Ibn Abbas,
may Allah be pleased with him, regarding the explanation of
this Ayah: and he shall be a known sign for the Hour. He
said: "It refers to the coming of 'Isa the son of Maryam, peace
be upon him, before the Day of Judgment." Ahmad Shakir
said: "Its chain of transmission is Sahih." And in the Hadith
of Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, he said:
"The Messenger of Allah (sg) said: 'By the One in Whose
Hand is my soul! The son of Maryam will soon descend
among you as a just ruler.'" Reported by Al-Bukhari (2222)
and Muslim (155). Ibn Kathir also mentioned the Hadiths
reported regarding the descent of 'Isa the son of Maryam,
peace be upon him, to the earth from the heavens, while
explaining the saying of the Exalted: 4 And there is none o f
the people o f the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must
believe in him before his death. And on the Day o f
Judgment, he will be a witness against them$ (An-Nisa'
4:159)

and anyone among this Ummah is incomprehensible. Then,
how about giving preference in such case?! As a result, this
objective fails right from its foundation, because it is from
Tanattu' (extremism) and the Mutanatti'un (extremists) will
perish, as stated by the Prophet ($&).[11
Secondly: We say that he (Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased
with him) is the best of this Ummah excluding 'Isa.
Thirdly: We say that 'Isa is not from the Ummah. It is not
correct for us to say that he is from his [the Prophet's (%)]
Ummah, since he (Isa, peace be upon him) came before him
[the Prophet ($^g)]; but he will be among his followers when
he descends, because the Shan ah of the Prophet (sg) shall
remain until the Day of Judgment.
If somebody says how can he (Isa, peace be upon him) be a
follower when he shall kill the pig, smash the cross and
accept nothing other than Islam. While, at the same time,
Islam leaves the People of the Book, provided they pay the
Jizyahl
Then we would reply that: The Prophet ($g) mentioning
that these events will occur, establishes it and makes it part
of his S harf ah; thereby abrogating the earlier ruling.

"Resurrection after the death": Resurrection, meaning
- bringing the people out of their graves after their
death. This is part of the 'Aqidah of People of Sunnah
and Jama'ah. This is confirmed by the Book, the Sunnah,
and the consensus of the Muslims - and even the
consensus of the Jews and the Christians - because they
also believe in a Day when people will be raised and
recompensed.

As regards the proof from the Qur'an, Allah, the Mighty

pleased with him.

and Sublime, said:

4The disbelievers claim that they will never be
resurrected (for the Account). Say: "Yes! By my Lord,
you will certainly be resurrected."4 (At-Taghabun 64:7)
He, the Mighty and Sublime, also said:

4,After that, surely, you will die. Then, surely, you
will be resurrected on the Day o f Resurrection} (AlMu'minun 23:15-16)
As for the proof from the Sunnah, there are Mutawitir
Hadiths from the Prophet ($&) regarding that.
The Muslims have a decisive consensus that mankind will
be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection, meet their Lord,
and be recompensed for their deeds.

Sublime, on the Day of Judgment without any good deed.
Look at w hat you have prepared for the Day of
Conveyence. What have you prepared for the meeting
day? Today, many people busy themselves with this world,
knowing fully well that it is not certain that they will get
what they work for in this world. A person might plan for
tomorrow, or after tomorrow, but he does not reach
tomorrow. Unfortunately, when it comes to what is sure,
many people are heedless of this. Allah, the Exalted, says:

4N ay, but their hearts are covered (blind) from
understanding this4 (Al-Mu'minun 23:63)
Regarding the deeds of this world, He, the Exalted, says:

4 And they have other (evil) deeds, besides, which they
are doingfy (Al-Mu'minun 23:63)
He uses a nominal sentence which implies affirmation and
continuity: He, the Exalted, says:

4 (It will be said to the sinners): "Indeed you were
heedless o f this"4 (Q af 50:22)
That is on the Day of Judgment.

4"Now We have removed your covering, and sharp is

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

a religion — is one of the six pillars of Iman, and an aspect
of the ‘Aqidah of the People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah.
No one who associates himself with any religion would
ever deny it.
❖

Faith in A l-Q ad a r - its good and its bad: This is the
sixth pillar, faith in Al-Qadar - its good and its bad.

Al-Qadar is the preordainment of Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, for all things. Allah, the Exalted, had written the
Destiny of everything fifty thousand years before the
creation of the heavens and earth 11] as He, the Mighty and
Sublime, said:

$Know you not that Allah knows all that is in heaven and
on earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lawh AlMahfuz). Verily! That is easy fo r Allahfy (Al-Hajj 22:70)
❖

His saying: "its good and its bad " : as for ascribing good
to Al-Qadar as good, it is clear; but in the case of bad,
the meaning of it is the bad that was ordained not AlQadar, which is Allah's doing, because there is no evil
in Allah's doing. All His doings are good and wise; evil
is only with respect to the objects of the doing and
decrees. The evil here is regarding the objects of the
decree and the doing, but not in regard to the doing
itself. That is why the Prophet (sg) said: "Evil cannot be

^

Based on the report of Muslim (2653) from 'Abdullah bin
'Amr who said: "I heard the Messenger ($g) say: 'Allah had
written the decrees of the creatures fifty thousand years
before He created the heavens and the earth.'" He said:
"And His Throne was upon the water."

ascribed to Y o u ."[1]
For example, we find evils among the decreed creations;
there are snakes, scorpions, predatory animals, diseases,
poverty, drought and things like that. All these things are
evil in relation to humans because they do not suit him.
There is also disobedience, wickedness, disbelief, rebel­
liousness, murder and other than that, all these are evils.
But with respect to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, they are
good, because Allah, the Exalted, has destined them for a
very important purpose; those who know it, know it, and
those who are ignorant of it, are ignorant of it.
Hence, it is imperative that we recognize that the evil
attributed to Al-Qadar is with respect to the objects of the
decree and the doing, not preordainment which is from the
preordainment of Allah and his doing.
Then, you should know that this object of the doing may be
evil itself but good in another respect. Allah, the Exalted, says:

4Evil has appeared on land and sea because o f what the
hands o f men have earned, that Allah may make them
taste a part o f that which they have done, in order that
they may return (by repenting to Allah, and begging
His Pardon)} (Ar-Rum 30:41)
This is a good result! As such, the evil attributed to the objected
decreed here, is not evil in reality since it leads to a good result.
Let's take the punishment of committing fornication for
example. The fornicator — who has never been married —
[1] Part of the Hadith of 'All bin Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased
with him, reported by Muslim (771).

94

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

will be given one hundred lashes and banished for a year.
Without doubt, this is bad for him unto itself, because he
would not find it comfortable. But it is still good from
another perspective, because it is expiation for his sins. So,
this is good, because the punishment of this life is less
severe than the punishment of the Hereafter, thus it is good
for him. Among its benefits is that it would deter others
and make them abstain from fornication, for if someone
intended to fornicate, and knew that the like of this will be
done to him in such case, then he would refrain doing it. It
can even be good for him, because he would never return
to such an act again.
With regard to the universally decreed matters, something
might be evil in regard to the object ordained such as
sickness. If a person falls sick, then there is no doubt that
this is bad to him. But in reality, it is good for him, and its
good for him is that it is an expiation of sins for him. A
person might have committed some sins that would not be
atoned for by seeking forgiveness and repenting, due to a
preventative factor; such as insincerity of intention towards
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. Then this sickness and
punishment serve as expiations of his sins.
Among its good is that the person may not have recognized
the magnitude of Allah's favor on him by granting him
sound health, until he becomes sick. Now we are healthy,
and we do not know the significance of sound health; but
once sickness begins, we would recognize the importance
of sound health. Thus, sound health is a crown on the
heads of the healthy; none actually recognizes it except the
sick. This is also good; it makes you realize the importance
of good health.
Among its good is that this sickness might destroy some
bacteria in the body which would not ordinarily be

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

95

removed, except by illness; the doctors would say that
some particular illnesses kill these bacteria in the body, but
you do know not.
In Summary, what we are saying is:
Firstly: The evil which is attributed to Al-Qadar is with
regard to the objects ordained by by Allah, as for what
Allah ordains, then all of it is good. The proof is in the
saying of the Prophet (sg): "Evil is not ascribed Y o u "'1'
Secondly: The evil in the object ordained is not absolute
evil; rather this evil may lead to matters that are good. So
its evilness is a relative matter.
The author, may Allah have mercy upon him, will later
discuss matters related to Al-Qadar with some details and
explain its stages according to the People of the Sunnah.

And from faith in Allah is the faith in what He describes

Muhammad ($&) has described Him with.

Concerning his statement: "And from faith in Allah is
the faith in what He describes Himself with in His Book, and
what His Messenger Muhammad (g&) has described Him
with.”

Its references preceded.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

96

The Commentary
❖

"And from faith:" Min (from) here indicates part of.
Because we have mentioned that faith in Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, comprises four things: Believing
in His Existence, and His sole (right of) Lordship, and
Divinity, and believing in His Names and Attributes.
That is, part of believing in Allah is the faith in what He
describes Himself with.

❖

"With what He describes Himself in His Book": It
should also be added: "and what He Names Himself".
But the author, may Allah have mercy upon him, only
mentioned the Attributes, perhaps because there is no
Name except that it contains an Attribute, or because
the disagreement regarding the Names is less serious;
none disproves of it except the extreme among the
Jahmiyyah and the Mu'tazilah. The Mu'tazilah, the
Asha'riyyah and the Maturidiyyah affirm the Names (of
Allah); but they disagree with the People of the Sunnah
and the Jamd'ah in most of the Attributes.

We now say: Why did the author only mention: "W hat
Allah describes Himself w ith"?
We say that this is due to one of two reasons: Either
because each Name contains an Attribute, or, because the
disagreement among those ascribing themselves to Islam
regarding the Names (of Allah) is less serious.
❖

"In His Book": His Kitab (Book) meaning the Qur'an.
Allah, the Exalted, named it a Book because it is written
in the Preserved Tablet, written in the pages carried by
the noble and dutiful Messengers - the Angels - and it is
also written like that among the people, writing it in the
Mushafs. So it is Kitab with the meaning of "w rit," and

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

97

Allah attributed it to Himself, because it is His Speech,
Glorious and Exalted is He. So this Qur'an is the
Speech of Allah, Allah spoke it, in reality, and every
letter is from Him, because He has indeed spoken it.
And in this statement there are some further subjects:
The first subject: That from faith in Allah is the faith in
what He describes Himself with. And its indication is that
faith in Allah - as preceded - comprises the belief in His
Names and Attributes. Because Dhatullah (Allah's Essence)
is named with some names and described with some
attributes. And, the existence of a mere essence, devoid of
attributes, is not possible. So it is not possible that there
would ever exist a mere essence devoid of attributes. The
idea that there may be some things without attributes could
be imagined, but is unlike the reality; that is, imagination is
unlike what actually occurs. A particular thing without
attributes can never be found in reality.
For example, one's mind can imagine a particular thing
with a thousand eyes, in each of the eyes one thousand
pupils and one thousand iris'; with one thousand feet, in
each of the feet, one thousand toes, in each of the toes, one
thousand nails; with millions of strands of hair, in each of
the strands, a million of strands of hair, and so on...!! This
can be imagined even if it is not real. But in reality, nothing
can be found without an attribute.
Hence, the belief in the Attributes of Allah, is part of the
belief in Allah. If there is no Attribute for Allah, except that
He exists a necessary existence, and this is as agreed upon
by everybody, then He must have Attributes.
The second subject: The Attributes of Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, are from the knowledge of the Unseen, and
what is incumbent upon man regarding matters of the
unseen is to believe in them as they are, without resorting

98

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

to anything apart from the textual proofs.
Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy upon him, said:
"Allah should not be described except in the way He has
described Himself, or as His Messenger has described Him.
The Qur'an and the Hadith should not be exceeded / ' 111
This means that we should not describe Allah except with
what He describes Himself in His Book or upon the tongue
of His Messenger (jg).
This is proven by the Qur'an and intellect:
In the Qur'an, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, says:

4 S ay : "(But) the things that my Lord has indeed
forbidden are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, every kind o f
unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed
openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppres­
sion, joining partners (in worship) with Allah fo r which
He has given no authority, and saying things about Allah
o f which you have no knowledge"4 (Al-A'rdf 7:33)
If you therefore describe Allah with an attribute that Allah
did not describe Himself with, you would have said about
Allah that which you do not know, and this is unlawful
according to the text of the Qur'an.
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, also said:

See: Majmu' Al-Fatawa by Shaikh Al-Islam (5:26)

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

99

4 And follow not that o f which you have no knowledge.
Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, o f each o f
those you will be questioned (by A llah)} (Al-lsra' 17: 36)
If we describe Allah with what He has not described
Himself, we would, by that, be pursuing that of which we
have no knowledge, and therefore falling into what Allah,
the Exalted, has prohibited.
As for the proof based on the intellect; the Attributes of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, are from the matters of the
Unseen, and it is not possible for the human intellect to
perceive the matters of the unseen. Therefore, we should
not describe Allah, the Exalted, with what He has not
described Himself, and we should not say "how ” His
Attributes are, because that is not possible.
We cannot, in reality, perceive the enjoyments of Paradise
that Allah has described, despite the fact that they are
already created. In Paradise, there are fruits, date-palm
trees, pomegranates, thrones, vessels, and the Hur. We
cannot comprehend the realities of these things. If we are
told: "Describe them to us,” we could not do that, because
of the saying of the Exalted:

4No person knows what is kept hidden fo r them o f joy as a
reward fo r what they used to do .4 (As-Sajdah 32:17)
And also because of His, Exalted be He, saying in the Qudsi
Hadith: "I have prepared for My righteous servants that
which no eye has seen, what no ear has heard of, and what
has never crossed the mind of any human being.” ^ If this
^

Reported by Al-Bukhan (3244) and Muslim (2824) from Abu
Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him.

100

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

is the case regarding a creation with attributes whose
meanings are known but whose realities are unknown,
what would then be the case concerning the Creator?
Another example: Man has a soul without which he cannot
live. If the soul is not in his body, he would not exist; yet he
cannot describe this soul. If he is asked: "W hat is this soul
that is in you? What is that thing, which if removed from
you, you will become dead, and if it remains with you, you
will be able to reason, understand and perceive?” He
would sit, look up, think hard, and will never be able to
describe it, even though it is very close to him, and is
within him. He would not be able to perceive it, in spite of
the fact that it is real - meaning, something seen, as is
mentioned by the Prophet (5* ) : "W henever the soul is
snatched, the sight follows it.” [1*
Man will see his soul while it is being taken away. That is
why the eyes remain open at death, looking at the soul
while it has departed the body. This soul will be snatched,
put in a shroud, and ascended with to Allah. Nevertheless,
he cannot describe it while it is within his own body. How
can he then try to describe the Lord in a way that He has
not described Himself!
The third subject: That we should not describe Allah, the
Exalted, with what He has not described Himself. The
evidence for that is also drawn from the textual proofs and
intellect. We mentioned two Ayahs above from the textual
proofs.
As for the intellect, we say: This is an unseen matter, it
cannot be grasped by rational contemplation, and we have
given two examples for that.
[1]

Reported by Muslim (920) from Umm Salamah, may Allah
be pleased with her.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

101

The fourth subject: The obligation of holding the textual
proofs reported in the Book and the Sunnah based on their
apparentness. We should not exceed that.
For example: When Allah, describes Himself with having
an Eye, should we say: "W hat is intended by the eye is
seeing, but not an eye in reality?" If we say that, we have
not described Him with what He has described Himself.
When Allah described Himself, with two Hands saying:

iN a y , both His Hands are widely outstretched$ (AlM aidah 5 :64)
If we say that Allah does not possess a hand in reality; and
that what is intended by the hand is His favor upon His
slaves, then have we described Him with what He
describes Himself? No!
The fifth subject: The generality of the author's statement
covers everything with which Allah describes Himself,
among the Attributes of His Essence in meaning (AlMa'nawiyah) and derived from revealed information (AlKhabariyah) , as well as the Attributes of His doings.
The Attributes of His Essence are those which Allah has
never ceased, nor ever will cease to be described with.
These are of two types:
Those of m eaning (A l-M a'n aw iy ah ), such as life, knowl­
edge, power, wisdom and the like, and these are examples,
not actually mentioning all.
The informative (A l-K h a b a riy a h ) : such as the two Hands,
the Face, the two Eyes and the like from what He named,
while something of that is used to describe us as well.
Allah, the Exalted, has never ceased having two Hands, a

102

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Face and two Eyes, none of that occurred after not having
them. He was never separate of any of these. As Allah, the
Exalted, has never ceased living nor ever will cease living,
nor ceased being All-powerful nor ever will cease being
All-powerful, and so on. Meaning, that His Life would not
need to be renewed, and His Hearing would not need to be
renewed. Rather, He has always been described with these
and shall ever be described with them. And the renewal of
what is heard does not necessitate the renewal of the
hearing. For example, if I hear the Adhan now, it does not
mean that I have just possessed a new ability to hear at that
particular time, but the hearing ability has been with me
since Allah created it for me. However, what is heard is
renewable and this does not have any effect on the
Attribute (of Hearing).
The scholars, may Allah have mercy upon them, termed
them "Attributes of Essence (Dhat)” because, as they say,
they are inseparable from the Self Dhat (of Allah); He is not
separate from them.
The Attributes of doing (Al-Fa'liyyah) are related to Allah's
will. These are of two types:
The Attributes with known causes, such as pleasure;
whenever Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, finds any cause
for being pleased, He, the Exalted, is pleased, as He said:

4 l f you disbelieve, then verily, Allah is not in need o f
you, He likes not disbelief fo r His slaves. And if you are
grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for
you } (Az-Zumar 39:7)
An example of the Attributes with unknown causes, is

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

103

descending to the lowest heaven during the last third of the
night.
There are some among these Attributes that can be both
Attributes of His Essence and those of His doing. For
example; Speaking is an attribute of doing on its own, but
from the view of its basis, it is a Dhatiyyah Attribute;
because Allah, the Exalted, never ceased, nor will He ever
cease from (having the Attribute of) Speaking. But He only
speaks with what He wills when He wills; as shall be
discussed under the section regarding "Speaking."
The scholars, may Allah have mercy upon them, termed
these Attributes: "Attributes of doing" because they are
from Allah's actions.
There are many proofs for it in the Qur'an, for example:

}A n d your Lord comes with the Angels in rows upon
row s} (.Al-Fajr 89:22)

}D o they then wait fo r anything other than that the
Angels should come to them, or that your Lord should
com e?} (Al-An'am 6:158)

}A llah is pleased with them and they with H im } (A lMa'idah 5:119)

}B u t Allah was averse to their being sent forth, so He
made them lag behind} (At-Tawbah 9:46)

104

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

iF o r that (reason) Allah's Wrath fell upon them and in
torment they will abided (Al-Ma'idah 5 :80)
Affirming these qualities for Allah, the Exalted, does not in
any way indicate imperfection, rather it is from His
Perfection, that He, the Exalted, does whatever He wills.
Those who distort (the meanings of Allah's Attributes) say
that affirming these Attributes indicates some imperfection;
hence they deny all the Attributes of doing. They say: He
does not come; He is not pleased, He is not angry, He does
not detest, He does not love.... They deny all of these,
claiming that these actions are newly occurring events, and
a new event is not established except by a new event. This
is baseless because it opposes the texts, and it is also
baseless in itself, because a newly occurring action does not
necessitate a new doer.
The sixth subject: There is no room for intellect in matters
concerning Names and Attributes; because the revealed
texts are the basis for either affirming or rejecting Names
and Attributes. Our intellect can never make a judgment
about Allah. The basis is therefore the revealed texts, in
contrast to the Asha'riyyah, the Mu'tazilah, the Jahmiyyah
and others of the people of Ta'til who use intellect as the
basis for affirming or negating the Attributes. They say:
Whatever the intellect judges to be affirmed, we affirm it,
whether Allah affirms it for Himself or not!
And whatever it judges to be negated, we negate it, even if
Allah affirms it! And whatever the intellect does not judge
to be affirmed, nor to be negated; then most of them negate
it, and say: "Positivism is the intellect's proof/' so if the
attribute is affirmed (by the intellect), we affirm it, and if it
is not affirmed, then we negate it.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

105

And among them are those who do not take a position
regarding it, so they do not affirm when the intellect does
not affirm it, but they do not deny it, since the intellect does
not negate it. They would therefore say: "W e do not take a
position," because to these people, negativism is the
intellect's proof. When it is not affirmed (by intellect) he
stops and does not negate it.
These people now use the intellect to judge what is
required or impossible for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime!
Based on this, whichever attribute the intellect judges that
Allah should be described with, they describe Allah with it,
even if it is not in the Book and the Sunnah; whatever the
reasoning justifies its negation for Allah, they negate it even
if it is in the Book and the Sunnah.
Therefore, they say, that Allah does not have eyes, a face
nor a hand. He does not ascend over the Throne, nor does
He descend to the lowest heaven. They resort to distortion
(’Tahrif) and refer to their distortion as interpretation
(Ta'wil). Had they outright rejected the Attributes, they
could have become disbelievers because they would have
belied (the Qur'an). But they reject them in a manner they
refer to as interpretation (Ta'wil); which is a distortion to us.
In summary, there is no room for intellect in the matters
regarding Allah's Names and Attributes.
If it is said: "W hat you say contradicts the Qur'an because
Allah said:

4 And who is better in judgment than Allah fo r a people
who have firm Faith?!
(ATMa'idah 5:50)
To choose (in preference) between two things is based upon
rational contemplation.

106

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, also said:

4And for Allah is the highest description^ (An-Nahl 16:60)
He, the Mighty and Sublime, also said:

41s then He, Who creates as one who creates not? Will
you not then remember?4 (An-Nahl 16:17)
And other Verses (Ayat), where Allah refers to the intellect,
concerning what He either affirms or negates for Himself,
while rebutting the false deities?"
We would reply by saying: The intellect can grasp what it
is required to describe Allah with, Glorious and Exalted is
He, and what He should not be described with, generally
speaking but not specifically speaking. For example,
intellect can understand that the Lord must possess perfect
attributes. However, this does not mean that intellect can
establish every attribute precisely or negate it precisely. It
can only establish or negate generally that He possesses
perfect Attributes and that He is free from imperfections.
For example, intellect can grasp the fact that Allah is AllHearing and All-Seeing. Ibrahim, said to his father:

4 " 0 my father, why do you worship that which does
not hear and does not see and will not benefit you at
all?"4 (Maryam 19:42)
And, that He is definitely the Creator, as Allah said:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

107

<$Is then He, Who creates as one who creates not? Will
you not then remember?$ (An-Nahl 16:17)

iT hose whom they invoke besides Allah have not created
anything$ (An-Nahl 16:20)
It can grasp this. It can also understand that Allah, Glorious
and Exalted is He, is not to be described as existent after
nothingness, such would be a form of imperfection, as
Allah said, the Exalted, while remonstrating the idol
worshippers:

iT hose whom they invoke besides Allah have not created
anything, but are themselves created^ (An-Nahl 16:20)
Then, based upon intellect, it is impossible the Creator
could ever be newly existent.
The intellect can also grasp the fact that it is not possible to
describe Allah with any description that is deficient,
because the Lord must be perfect. So it can grasp the fact
that He is free from being incapable, because this is an
attribute of imperfection; for if the Lord was powerless, and
disobeyed, and He w ants to punish the one who
disobeyed, and He is incapable, then He can not do it!
Therefore, intellect can grasp the fact that incapability
could not possibly be attributed to Allah. And blindness is
like that as well, and deafness is like that, and so too is
ignorance. These are general matters, we can grasp that.
But as for the details, we are not able to grasp that. So we
must stick to the revealed texts.
A question: Is everything that is perfection in our case,
perfection in the case of Allah? And is everything that is

108

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

imperfect in our case, imperfect in the case of Allah?
The answer is no. Because analysis of perfection and defect
is not contingent upon what is attributed to humans, due to
the clear difference between the Creator and creation. But it
is contingent upon the description itself; any description of
perfection is affirmed for Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He.
So eating and drinking in the case of the Creator is a defect,
because its cause is a need, and Allah the Exalted is free of
any need from other than Him. But it is a form of perfection
with in the case of the created. And due to this, if a person
is not eating, then there is no doubt he must be ill or
something like that; and this is a defect.
And sleep is a defect in the case of the Creator, but for the
created it is a form of perfection; and the difference
becomes clear.
Pride is a form of perfection for the Creator and a defect for
the created. Because the majesty and greatness cannot be
complete except with pride, so that there can be a complete
authority in which none could compete with Him. That is
why Allah, the Exalted, threatens the one who competes
with Him in pride and greatness. He, the Mighty and
Sublime, said: "W hoever competes with me in either of the
two, I will punish h im ."^
What is important, is that not everything that is perfect
with respect to creation is perfect with respect to the
Creator, and not everything that is imperfect with respect

111 Based on the report of Muslim (2620) from Abu Sa'ld alKhudrl and Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with them
both, who both said: "Glory is His Izar and Pride is His Rida';
'So whoever contends with me, I will punish him."' Imam
Ahmad (2:414) has reported similarly from Abu Hurairah,
may Allah be pleased with him.

to the creation is imperfect with respect to the Creator;
because perfection and imperfection are relative.
These are the six subjects under the heading: "W hat He
describes Himself w ith ." All of them are important
subjects, and we mentioned them prior to other matters
of 'Aqidah because we will build upon them with what
follows if Allah, the Exalted, wills.

"A nd with what His M essenger describes H im :" The
Messenger's ( 0 ) description of his Lord is divided into
three categories: By saying, by action, and by tacit
approval.
As for sayings, there are many, for example: "O ur
Lord! Allah Who is above the heavens! Hallowed be
Your Name, Your order permeates the heavens and the
earth." And also his (-5*?) statement while swearing:
"N o, by the One who turns the hearts ."111
As for actions, they are fewer than sayings, for example
his pointing to the heavens, making Allah a witness to
his Companions' acknowledgment of having conveyed
the Message, and this happened during the Farewell
Pilgrimage at 'Arafah. He ( 0 ) addressed the people,
and asked: "H ave I conveyed the Message? They
replied: "Y e s" three times, and he { 0 ) said: "O Allah,
bear witness" ^ — while raising his hand to the
heavens, and pointing to the people. This is a
description of Allah, the Exalted, with transcendence
(Al-Ulu) by action.

of the second volume - Allah willing.

Allah be pleased with him.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Friday, and said: "O the Messenger of Allah, property has
perished..." and he raised his hands 111 (to supplicate). This
is also a description of Allah with transcendence by action;
and others like that from the Hadiths of the Messenger ($g),
wherein he mentioned some of Allah's Attributes.
The Messenger (M|) would sometimes mention one of
Allah's Attributes and corroborate it with his action. That
happened when he recited the Ayah:

ij r u l y , Allah is Ever All-Hearer, A l l - S e e r (An-Nisa'
4:58)
He then placed his thumb on his right ear and the index
finger on his eye .121 This is an affirmation of seeing and
hearing with statement and action. We, therefore, say that
the Messenger's (#|) affirmation of Allah's Attributes can
be by saying or by action - either collectively, or separately.
As for tacit approval, such cases are fewer than those
previously mentioned. For example; his tacit approval to a

111 Reported by Al-Bukhari (1013), (1014) and Muslim (897)
from Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him.
[21 Al-Hafiz said in Al-Fath (13:373): Reported by Abu Dawud
with a strong chain according to the criteria of Muslim, from
the narration of Abu Yunus, from Abu Hurairah, may Allah
be pleased with him: 'I saw the Messenger ($fe) recite it - that
is, His saying - "Verily, Allah commands that you should
render back the trusts to those to whom they due up to His
saying - Truly, Allah is Ever All-Hearer, All-Seer. - And he
placed his two fingers.'" Abu Yunus said: "Abu Hurairah,
may Allah be pleased with him, placed his thumb on his ear
and the one that follows it (the index finger) on his eye."
And the Hadith was graded Sahih by Al-Alban! in Sdhih Abu
Dawiid (4738).

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

112

most sincere of all people in advising Allah's servants, the
most truthful of all people regarding what he says, and the
most eloquent of all people in his expressions. As such, he
embodies four qualities that necessitate the acceptance:
Knowledge, sincere advice, truthfulness and eloquence. It
is, therefore, obligatory that we accept everything that he
informed of from his Lord. He (sg) is - by Allah - more
eloquent, more sincere in advice, and more knowledgeable
than the rationalists and the philosophers whom the people
follow. In spite of this, he would still say: "Glory be to You;
I can not enumerate Your praise, You are as You extol
Yourself." ^

Without T ahn f (distortion), nor Ta'til (denial), nor
Takyif (saying how), nor Tamthil (likening).

•

Concerning his saying: "Without T ahn f (distortion), nor
Ta'til (denial), nor Takyif (saying how), nor Tamthil
(likening)."

The Commentary
❖

This phrase contains a description of the faith of the
People of the Sunnah, regarding the Attributes of Allah,
the Exalted. The People of the Sunnah believe in them
with a faith devoid of these four: Tahrif (distortion), Ta'til
(denial), Takyif (saying how) and Tamthil (likening).

111 Reported by Muslim (486) from 'Aishah, may Allah be
pleased with her.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

113

As for Tahrif (distortion), it means to change, and can be by
expression or by meaning. The preponderance is that Tahrif
does not occur by expression. But when it does occur, it
only occurs from an ignorant person. Tahrif by expression,
means changing the pronunciation, for example, you will
never hear somebody reciting "Al-Hamda lillahi rabbil'Aldmin" with a Fath on the Dal, except one who is an
ignorant person. This is what is common (of distortions by
expression).
But Tahrif in meaning is the one that occurs the most
among the people. But the faith of the People of Sunnah and
the Jamd'ah in what Allah describes Himself with, is free
from Tahrif - that is from changing the expression or the
meaning.
Those who change the meaning, they call it “Ta’wil
(interpretation)” and refer to themselves as people of
Ta'wil, so that such speech has an acceptable appearance,
and such Ta'wil will not cause the souls to flee from it nor
object to it. However, in reality what they do is Tahrif. This
is because there is no sound evidence for it, but they are not
able to say: "O ut of Tahrif' and if they were to say: "This is
Tahrif' then they themselves would have denied their
statements. As such, the author, may Allah have mercy
upon him, used the word Tahrif instead of Ta'wil, even
though many others who discuss this matter usually
condemn Ta'wil, saying: "W ithout Ta'wil." But the word
used by the author is most preferable, for four reasons:
Firstly, this is the word used in the Qur'an, as Allah, the
Exalted, said:

}H ere are some who displace words (Yuharrifun) from
(their) right p laces.} (An-Nisa 4:46)

114

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The expression used in the Qur'an is more worthy than
others, because it best expresses the meaning.
Secondly, it best expresses the situation, and is much closer
to justice, because it will not be just to refer to the one who
interprets without any proof as somebody who engages in
Ta'wil. We should rather describe him with what befits
him; and that is he is a M uharrif (someone who distorts).
Thirdly, interpretation without any proof is false; it is
obligatory to stay far from it, and keep people away from
it. And using the term Tahrif, rather than Ta'wil, sounds
more detestable, because no one will accept Tahrif, while
Ta'wil appears light, the soul can bear it, and its actual
meaning will therefore wither away. But as for Tahrif, our
mere mentioning it scares away people from it. So using
Tahrif regarding those who oppose the path of the Salaf
(pious predecessors) is more befitting than using the term
Ta'wil.
Fourthly, Ta'wil is not absolutely condemnable. The
Prophet (5H) said: "O Allah, grant him the understanding
of the religion, and provide him the knowledge of Ta'wil
(in terp re ta tio n )^
Allah, the Exalted, also says:
Alii "i/J ripjlj

—«)

$But none knows its Ta'wil (hidden meanings) save
Allah. And those who are firm ly grounded in
knowledge^ (Al 'Imran 3:7)
Allah, the Exalted, commends them for possessing the
111 Reported by Ahmad in Al-Musnad (2396) and Al-FasawT in
Al-Ma'rifah wat-Tarikh (1:494) and Ahmad Shakir graded it
Sahili. Al-Bukhari reported it (75 and 143), with the wording:
"O Allah, teach him the Book.”

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

115

knowledge of Ta'wil.
Ta'wil is not therefore totally condemnable because it has a
number of meanings, it can mean Tafsir, and it can mean
the end result and destination, and it can mean changing an
expression from what is obvious.
1. So it can mean Tafsir, such as when many scholars of
Tafsir (Qur'anic exegesis) say, when they explain an
Ayah: "The Ta'wil of Allah's statement is such-andsuch.” Then, they would mention the meaning. Here,
Tafsir is referred to as "Ta'wil.'' This is because they
interpret the statement; that is to give an interpretation
to the meaning intended by it.
2. As for Ta'wil with the meaning of a thing's outcome,
this occurs when it is used in an assertive statement. Its
outcome will therefore be either doing it, if it is a
command, or abandoning it, if it is a prohibition. But if
it is used in an informative; its Ta'wil will mean its
occurrence.
An example of an informative statement is, the saying of
Allah, the Exalted:

4 Await they just fo r the final fulfillment o f the event?
On the Day the event is finally fulfilled (i.e. the Day o f
Resurrection), those who neglected it before will say:
" Verily, the Messengers o f our Lord did come with the
truth"} (Al-A'rdf 7:53)
Meaning, these people do not await anything except the
end result and the destination of what they were informed,
the Day in which that which they were informed of comes.
Then, those who have forgotten it will say: "Indeed the

116

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Messengers of our Lord came with the truth.”
Another example of it is when Yusuf's parents and brothers
fell in prostration for him, he said:

4This is the interpretation o f my dream aforetime!$
(Yusuf 12:100)
Meaning - this is the result of my dream, because he said so
after they had prostrated.
An example in an assertive statement, is the statement of
'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her: "The Prophet (#g)
would often say the following, during bowing and
prostration, after Allah, the Exalted, had revealed to him
the statement:

4 When comes the Help o f Allah and the conquest (of
Makkah)$> (An-Nasr 110:1)
(He would say) 'O Allah, Glory be to You, O Allah forgive me”
out of Ta'wil of the Qur'an.'” ^ - meaning, acting upon itJ2'
3.

The third meaning of Ta'wil is changing the expression
from what is obvious. This category is divided into
both what is praiseworthy and what is condemnable; if
evidence proves it, then it is praiseworthy, and it is
from the first category, the category of Tafsir. But if the
evidence does not prove it, then it is condemnable, and

111 Reported by Al-Bukhari (4967 and 4968), and Muslim (484)
from 'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her.
121 (Translation note): That is, because what follows that later is:
"So glorify your Lord and seek forgiveness." So he (jg)
obeyed that by doing it during the prayer.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

117

it is from the category of T ah n f (distortion) and
therefore not from the category of Ta'wil. This second
one is the category of the people of T ahn f regarding the
Attributes of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
For example, Allah, the Exalted, said:

i-The Most Beneficent (Allah) Istawa (rose over) the
Throne} (Ta Ha 20:5)
What is obvious in the expression, is that Allah, the
Exalted, is ascended over the Throne: settled above it and
exalted above it. If anybody now says that the meaning of
Istawa’ is He, the Exalted, took over (Istawla) the Throne, we
will say: "This is your own interpretation, because you
have changed the expression from what is obvious for it,”
rather this is in reality a distortion, because there is no
evidence to prove it; the proof is rather against it, as it shall
be explained - if Allah wills.
As for His, the Exalted, saying:

iT h e event, ordained by Allah will come to pass, so
seek not to hasten it} (An-Nahl 16:1)
The meaning of — } the event, ordained by A llah} is Allah's
command shall soon come to pass. This differs from
what is obvious in the expression, but there is evidence
for it, and it is His saying: ^So seek not to hasten it .}
In the same manner, is His, the Exalted, saying:

}S o when you recite the Qur'an, seek refuge with Allah
from the Shaitan (Satan), the outcast (the cursed on e)}

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

118

(An-Nahl 16:98)
Meaning - whenever you want to recite the Qur'an. It does
not mean when you have finished reciting the Qur'an, say:
"I seek refuge in Allah from the accursed Shaitan.'' Since,
we have learned in the Sunnah, that whenever the Prophet
($fe) wanted to recite, he would seek refuge in Allah from
the accursed Shaitan,^ not after having completed the
recitation. This Ta'wil is, therefore, correct.
Also, in the report of Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased
with him: "W henever the Prophet (*g) entered the area in
which he would relieve himself, he would say: 'I seek
refuge in Allah from Al-Khubuthi w al-Khabaith. '" [2] The
meaning of "w hen he entered" is when he wanted to enter,
because it is not proper to utter remembrance of Allah
inside such a place. As such, we interpret: "w hen he
entered" - to mean, when he wanted to enter. This kind of
interpretation is supported with a sound evidence, and it
will be considered a kind of Tafsir.
For this reason, we say that referring to a kind of Ta'wil that
is not based on a sound proof as Tahrif is best, because this
is found in the Qur'an, and it best befits the way of the
Muharrif. Besides, it is better in repulsing others from this
path which opposes the path of the Salaf (pious predeces­
sors), and because every form of Tahrif is condemnable,
Based on the report of Ibn Abl Shaibah and Al-BaihaqI in his
Sunan, as mentioned in Ad-Durr Al-Manthur, from Jubair bin
Mut'im: "When the Prophet (sg) commenced Salaah He
pronounced the Takbir (saying Alldhu Akbar) and then said: 'I
seek refuge in Allah from Shaitan the accursed.'"
121 Reported by Al-Bukharl (142) and Muslim (375), from Anas,
may Allah be pleased with him. (Translation note):
"Khubuthi wal-Khabd'ith" Meaning, the male and female
filthy things, or the male and female devils.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

119

unlike Ta'wil - some forms of which are acceptable while
some are condemnable. Therefore, calling this (condemn­
able practice) Tahrif is better than calling it Ta'wil for four
reasons.
❖

"Nor T a'til (denial):" Ta'til literally means "to desert
and forsake" as is in the Word of Allah:

iatid (many) a deserted well} (Al-Hajj 22:45)
Meaning, forsaken and abandoned.
What is intended by Ta'til, is to reject - wholly or partly the Names and Attributes that Allah affirms for Himself,
whether in the form of Tahrif (distortion) or Juhiid (outright
denial), all of this is called Ta'til. The People of the Sunnah
and the Jama'ah do not reject any of Allah's Names or
Attributes; nor do they deny them, rather they completely
approve of them.
If you ask, "W hat is the difference between Ta'til and
Tahrif?" We would say: Tahrif occurs with evidences and
Ta'til occurs with what is proven by the evidence. For
example, if somebody says, regarding Allah's saying:

4Nay both His Hands are extended^ (Al-Ma’idah 5 :64)
— that it refers to is His might, then he has distorted the
evidence and denied the correct meaning, because the
intent is the Hand in reality. He has thus denied the
intended meaning, and affirmed a meaning other than
what is intended. If he says: "N ay both His Hands are
extended' - 'I don't know! I surrender the matter with
Allah. I neither affirm the Hand in reality, nor a hand
whose expression is distorted." We would say: This is a
denier, not a distorter, because he neither changes the

120

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

meaning of the expression, nor interprets it in a way that
opposes the intent, rather, he denied the intended meaning,
which is affirming the Hand for Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime.
The People of the Sunnah and the Jama ah are innocent of
two paths:
The First Path: The path of those who distort the
expression, by denying the meaning of the reality intended
(distorting it) to a meaning that was not intended.
The second path, and it is the path of the people of Tafivid.
So they (the People of the Sunnah) do not commit Tafwidh
like this person, they rather say: "W e say 4 Nay both His
Handsfy meaning: His two Hands, in reality; 4are
extended4, and they are neither might nor favor.”
The creed of the People of the Sunnah and the Jamd'ah is free
from both Tahrif and Ta'til. With this we know the
misguidance or lies of those who say that the path of the
Salaf is Tafwid. Those (who say so) will be considered
misguided if they are ignorant of the path of the Salaf, and
they will be considered liars if they do so deliberately. We
can also consider all of them liars if they do so for either of
the two reasons (earlier mentioned) according to the usage
of the people of the H ijaz^ because "lie " to them can also
be used to mean "m istake."
In any case, there is no doubt that those who say that the
Madhhab of the People of the Sunnah and the Jamd'ah is
Tafivid are wrong, because the Madhhab of the People of the
Sunnah is to affirm the meanings and surrender the
knowledge regarding its how to Allah, the Exalted.

Then, it should also be known that Tafwid — as said by
Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah[1] — is among the worst
positions of the people of innovation and heresy.
Whenever one hears about T afw id , he says: "This is good,
safer than this one and that one. I will neither follow the
position of the Salaf, nor the position of the people of Ta'wil.
I will rather follow the moderate path, which is safer than
either of them. I would rather say: 'Allah knows best. I
don't know their m eanings.'" But Shaikh Al-Islam said:
"This is among the worst positions of the people of
innovation and heresy."
And he, may Allah have mercy upon him, has indeed
spoken the truth. If you take note, you will discover that it
belies the Qur'an, and ascribes ignorance to the Messenger
(sg), and provides support for the philosophers.
It belies the Qur'an, because Allah, the Exalted, says:

4And We have sent down to you the Book as an
exposition o f everything^ (An-Nahl 16: 89)
What exposition is in words whose meanings can not be
known? Whereas the Names and Attributes are the topic
most often referred to in the Qur'an, and the most often
mentioned in the Qur'an. If it is such that we could not
know their meanings, can the Qur'an then be an exposition
of everything? Where is the exposition?
These people are saying that the Messenger ($g) did not
know the meanings in the Qur'an that relate to Allah's
Names and Attributes. If the Messenger ($g) did not know,
it is more obvious that others could not know.

In D ar’ Ta'arud Al-'Acjl wan-Naql by Shaikh Al-Islam Ibn
Taymiyyah (1:121).

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Stranger still than this, is their saying: "The Messenger ( 0 )
spoke with speech, regarding Allah's Attributes, but he did
not know their meanings." He ($§;) said: "O ur Lord is Allah
who is above the heavens."[11 But, were he to be asked
about this, he would say: "I do not know!" And like his
statement: "O ur Lord descends to the lowest h e a v e n . " I f
he was asked, "W hat is the meaning of, 'Our Lord
descends,' he would reply: 'I do not know .'" And the
same would be applied to other cases.
Is there any defamation worse than this defamation of the
Messenger ( 0 ? Rather, this is the worst of defamations.
Would a Messenger be sent by Allah to clarify for the
people, yet he does not know the meaning of the Ayat
about the Attributes, and the Hadiths regarding them, and
at the same time, he speaks with speech, and does not
know the meaning of any of that!
So these are two routes; belying the Qur'an, and ascribing
ignorance to the Messenger ( 0 ) .
And in this, is an opening of the door for the heretics in
their attacks against the people of Tajwid. They say: "You
do not know anything; we are the ones who know ." They
then, begin explaining the Qur'an in ways other than what
Allah intended. They say: "O ur affirmation of meanings to
the texts, is better than us being illiterate, not knowing
anything." They then discussed the statem ents and
Attributes of Allah the way they like!! The people of Tajwid
cannot refute them because they claim: "W e don't know

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

what Allah intends, it is possible that what you say is what
Allah intends." So they open the door to tremendous evils.
And it was based upon this that the false statement came
about: "The path of the Salaf (the pious predecessors) is
safer, while the path of Khalaf (the later generations) is more
knowledge based and wiser."!
Shaildh Al-Islam, may Allah have mercy upon him, said:
"Some ignoramuses have said this." It is correct; whoever
says this, he is an ignoramus.
This statement is one of the falsest in utterance and intent;
"The path of Salaf is safer while the path of the Khalaf is
more knowledge based and w iser." How is it more
knowledge based, wiser, and this one is safer? No safety
can be attained without knowledge and wisdom. The one
who does not know the way, he can not be safe, because he
does not have knowledge. If he had knowledge and
wisdom, he would be safe. There is no safety except with
knowledge and wisdom. If you say: "The path of the Salaf
is safer," it is biding that you should say it is also more
knowledge based and wiser, or else you will be contra­
dicting yourself.
Therefore, the correct expression will be: "The path of the
Salaf (pious predecessors) is safer, more knowledge based,
and wiser. This is well known. The path of the Khalaf is as
was said:[1]
Upon my life, I have toured all the places
And walked myself in all these abodes
I never saw except him who placed his hand, confused
l1!

These two poems were mentioned by ' Abdul-Karim AshShahrastaru in his book Nihayat Al-Iqdam f i ‘Ilm Al-Kalam,
and it is not clear who said it. See As-Sawa'iq by Ibn AlQayyim (1:166).

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

124

Upon his chin,
Or him who was gnashing
The teeth in regret
This is the path, upon which he says he did not find anyone
except that he put the hand of confusion on his chin. Such a
person does not have knowledge, and the other one;
gnashing his teeth in regret.
Ar-Razi, who was one of their elders, said:[1]
The end o f the prowess o f intellects is shackles
And most o f the realms hasten to misguidance
Our souls are in loneliness from our bodies
The end o f our life is danger and trial
We never benefited from our research all our life
Except that we gathered in it, he said, and they said.
He later said: "I have pondered the path of Kalam, and the
methods of the philosophers; I do not find them curing the
ailment nor satiating the thirst. I found the path of the
Q ur'an to be the closest path. I read regarding the
affirmation (of Allah's Attributes):

$The Most Gracious rose over the Throne}- (Ta Ha 20:5)

4 To Him ascend the goodly wordsfy (Fatir 35:10)
And read, regarding the negation:

4There is nothing like unto Him^ (Ash-Shura 42:11)

[1'

These lines of Al-Fakhr Ar-Razi were mentioned in his book
Aqsam Al-Ladhat; see A s-Saw aiq by Ibn Al-Qayyim (1:167).

125

And

{A n d they will never compass

anything

o f His

Whoever did as I have done, he will realize what I have
realized.”
To these we say: Is your way more knowledge based and
wiser? He who says: "I wish I die on the belief of the
decrepit of Naysabur” ^ whereas, the decrepit were
among the common people, he wishes to return to the
ignoramuses! Would it be said that he is more knowledge­
able and wiser? Where is the knowledge they possess?
It becomes clear that the path of Tafwid is a mistaken path,
because it comprises three evils: Belying the Qur'an,
ascription of ignorance to the Messenger (#|), and
making way for the philosophers. Those who say the
position of the Salaf is that of Tafwid have lied against the
Salaf They (the Salaf) rather affirmed the expression and the
meaning. They also accepted it, and they explained it with
the best explanation. The People of the Sunnah and the
Jama ah neither distort nor deny (Allah's Attributes). They
say, according to the meanings of the texts, as intended by
Allah:

4 He rose over the Throne^ (Al-A'raJ7 :54)
Meaning - rose above it; its meaning is not: "H e conquered
it.” And with His Hand, meaning - Hand, in reality, not
might or favor. So there is no distortion nor denial with

Ibn Al-Qayyim (1:167).

them.
❖

"Without T a k y if (saying how ):" Takyif is not men­
tioned in the Book and the Sunnah, but what is
mentioned is what proves its prohibition.

Takyif is that you mention how the Attribute is. And Takyif
is that it be asked: "H ow ?" If I say: "H ow did Zaid come?"
And you replied: "(H e came) riding." You have described
the manner of his coming. "H ow is the color of the car?"
"W hite." You have mentioned the color.
The People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah do not engage in
saying how A llah's Attributes are, due to revealed
evidences and rational evidences:
As for the revealed evidences; an example is the statement
of the Exalted:

iS a y : “The things that my Lord has indeed forbidden
are Al-Fawahish (great evil sins, every kind of unlawful
sexual intercourse, etc.) whether committed openly or
secretly, sins, unrighteous oppression, joining partners
with Allah for which He has given no authority, and
saying things about Allah of which you have no
knowledge$ (Al-A‘rdf 7:33)
The testimony is in His saying:
i' o ft i y a i t £

oU

4And saying things about Allah of which you have no
knowledge}

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

127

So when a man comes and says: "Allah rose above the
Throne in this manner" and he describes the manner in a
particular way, we say: "This person has spoken about
Allah regarding that whose knowledge he does not
possess. Did Allah, the Exalted, inform you that He rises
in that manner? No! Allah informed us that He rose, He did
not inform us how He rose." So we say: This is Tayif and
speaking about Allah without knowledge. That is why one
of the Salaf said: "If a Jahmi says to you: 'Allah descends to
the heaven, how does He descend?' Reply to him with:
'Allah (only) informed us of His descent, He did not inform
us how He descends.'" This is a very beneficial principle.
Another textual evidence is the saying of Allah, the
Exalted:

$And follow not that of which you have no knowledge.
Verily! The hearing, and the sight and the heart, of each
of those you will be questioned$ (Al-Isra 17:36)
Do not follow that of which you have no knowledge;

4 Verily! The hearing, and the sight and the heart, of
each of those you will be questioned
As for rational evidence: The how of a thing cannot be
known except through one of these matters — witnessing it
or witnessing its like, or information from a truthful source
about it. Meaning whether you witnessed it yourself, and
you are familiar with how it is, or you have seen its like.
Such as in the case when someone says: "So-and-so bought
a Datsun Car, Model 88, year 2000, you are familiar with

128

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

how it is, because you have one like it, or (you are familiar
with it) through the report of a trustworthy person. Such as
when a trustworthy man comes to you and says: "So-andso's car is like this and that," and describes it completely,
now you know how it is.
That is why some scholars also gave a subtle reply, saying:
The meaning of our statement "without T a k y if does not
mean that we do not believe it has not how, rather we
believe it has a how, but the negation is of us knowing its
how. This is because Allah's rising above the Throne,
without doubt, has a how, but it is not known. His descent
to the lowest heaven has a how, but it is not known,
because there is nothing existing except that it has a how,
but it can either be known, or it could be unknown.
Imam Malik, may Allah have mercy upon him, was asked
regarding Allah's saying:

iT h e Most Gracious rose over the T h r o n e (7a Ha
20:5)
"H ow did He rise?" Malik, may Allah have mercy upon
him, bowed his head until it became soaked up with sweat.
Then, he raised his head, and said: "The rising is not
unknown" meaning regarding its known meaning, because
the Arabic Language is well known to us. Every place
where the word "rise " is used with the preposition
"above", its meaning is "rise over." He, may Allah have
mercy upon him, said: "The rising is not unknown, but the
how is beyond intellect" Because the intellect cannot grasp
the how. So when the evidences - revealed and rational negate how, then it is obligatory to refrain from it.
"Believing it is obligatory" — because Allah Himself

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

129

informed about it, it therefore becomes obligatory to trust
it; (and he said) "asking about it is innovation.” 111
Enquiring about the how of it is innovation, because those
who were more inquisitive never asked of such; they are
the Companions - may Allah be pleased with them. When
Allah said:

$Then He rose over the T h r o n e .(A l-A 'ra f 7:54)
They were aware of the magnificence of Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, and the meaning of rising over the Throne,
and that it was not possible to be asked: "H ow did He
rise?” Since you can never comprehend that; if we are
asked (regarding that) we reply: "This question is an
innovation.”
The response of Malik, may Allah have mercy upon him, is
a scale for all of the Attributes. If somebody asks you for
example: "Allah descends to the lowest heaven, how does
He descend?” "Descent is not unknown; the manner is
beyond intellect, believing it is obligatory, while enquiring
about it is innovation.” As for those who ask: "H ow is the

Reported by Al-Lalaka'i in Sharh As-Sunnah (664), and AlBaihaqi in Al-Asma was-Sifat (867). In Al-Fath (13:407) AlHafiz said: "Its chain is Jayyid (good)." And it was reported
by Ad-Darim! in Ar-Rad 'alal-]ahamiyyah (104), and Ibn
'Abdul-Bar in At-Tamhid (7:151). After the saying of Malik,
Shaikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: "And this reply is
confirmed from Rabi'ah the Shaikh of Malik, and this reply
has been related from Umm Salamah, may Allah be pleased
with her, in Mawyuf and Marfu' form, but its chain is not
such that is depended upon. And like this, there are others
whose sayings are in agreement with that of Malik." Majmii'
Al-Fatawa (5:365).

130

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

descent possible while the one third of the night differs
(from one land to another)." We reply that asking this
question is innovation. How could you ask a question that
was not asked by the Companions - may Allah be pleased
with them all. They craved for good more than you do, and
for more knowledge of what is obligatory regarding Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, than you do. We are not more
knowledgeable than the Messenger ( ^ ) , and he did not
inform them. Therefore, this question of yours is an
innovation. Had we not had a good opinion about you,
we could have described you with what befits you, that is,
you are an innovator.
Al-Imdm Malik, may Allah have mercy upon him, said: "I
do not consider you except as an innovator." Then it was
ordered that he (the questioner) be removed. This is
because the Salaf detested the people of innovation, their
statements, objections, assumptions and arguments.
My brother, it is upon you to surrender yourself regarding
this matter. From the complete submission to Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, is to not delve into these matters. That
is why I have always warned you against such delving into
what is related to Allah's Names and Attributes stubbornly
and obstinately, since the Companions - may Allah be
pleased with them - never enquired about such. This is
because once we open these topics for ourselves, other
topics will be open before us, and the barriers will be
demolished, then we will not be able to restrain ourselves.
Hence, say: "W e hear and we obey, and we believe and we
trust. We believe in and trust the information, and we obey
the command, and we hear the saying" so that you can be
safe!
And any person who asks something related to the
Attributes of Allah, which the Companions did not ask

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

131

about, then say just as Imam Malik, may Allah have mercy
upon him, said, for there is a precedent for you in that asking about this is an innovation. Once you say this, such
a person will never insist on asking you. If he insists, tell
him: "O you innovator, asking about this is an innovation.
Ask about rulings that you are responsible for. As for your
asking about something related to the Lord, the Mighty
and Sublime, and His Names and His Attributes, while the
Companions never asked about it; then we will never
accept this from you!”
There are statements reported from the Salaf proving that
they understood the meanings of the Attributes of Allah
which He revealed to His Messenger (j§;), as is reported
from Al-Awza'i and others. It was reported from them
regarding the Aydt and Hadiths about Allah's Attributes:
"Stick to them as they came, without h ow ."fl]
This proves that they affirmed meanings, from two angles:
Firstly: They said: "Stick to them as they came”; and it is
known that they are expressions that came with meanings,
they did not come out of folly. Therefore, if we stick to
them as they came, this necessitates that we affirm that
they have meanings.
Secondly: Their statement: "without how;” because negat­
ing how proves the existence of a basis for the meaning,
because there will not be a negation of the how of a thing
were it mere nonsense and folly. Therefore, this popular
saying from the Salaf proves that they affirmed meanings
for these texts.
❖

"N or Tamthil (likening):" Meaning without Tamthfl.
The People of the Sunnah are innocent of likening
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, to any of His creation,

[11

Reported by Al-Lalaka'i in Shark As-Sunnah (875).

132

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

neither in His Self, nor in His Attributes. Tamthil means
to mention similarities for a thing, and the differences
between it and Takyif are generals and specifics.
Because every person who does Tamthil has definitely
done Takyif, but (on the other hand) not every person
who engages in Takyif has engaged in Tamthil. This is
because Takyif, involves mentioning the how without
coupling it with similarities. For example, if you say: "I
have a pen whose how is such-and-such.” If this is
coupled with the mention of something similar, it
becomes an act of Tamthil. For example, I say: "That
pen is similar to this pen” because I mentioned
something that is similar to another thing, and you
become familiar with this pen by mention of what is
similar to it.
The People of the Sunnah and the Jama ah affirm the
Attributes for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, without
similarities. They say: "Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has
life, but not like our own life, He has knowledge, but not
like our knowledge, He has sight, but not like our sight; He
has a Face, but not like our faces; He has a Hand, but not
like our hands.” And this is the case with all of the
Attributes. They say: "Indeed, Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, shall never be similar - in what He has described
Himself with - to any of His creatures.”
And for this, they have textual and rational evidences:
The textual evidences:
These are divided into two types: Declarative, and
imperative.
Among the declarative, is the statement of the Exalted:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

133

4There is nothing like unto Him$ (Ash-Shura 42:11)
There is a clear refutation of Tamthil in this Ayah.
And His saying:
/A &
4 Do you know o f any who is similar to H im f (Maryam
19:65)
This is because this Ayah, even if it is in a question form,
has the import of information, because it is an interrogative
with the meaning of a negation.
And His statement:

i^And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him)>
(Al-Ikhlds 112:4)
All of these Ayat are evidence of a negation of similarities.
And they are all declarative statements.
Whoever likens Allah to any of His creatures, then he has
indeed belied the information, and disobeyed the order.
That is why the Salaf generally pronounced the disbelief of
anyone who likened Allah to any of His creatures. Hence,
Nu'aim bin Hammad Al-Khuza'I, may Allah have mercy
upon him, the teacher of Imam Al-Bukhari, may Allah have
mercy upon him, said: "W hoever likens Allah with His
creation, has committed Kufr ( d i s b e l i e f ) . T h i s is because
he combined between belying the message, and the
disobeying the command.

Siyar A'lam An-Nubald' (10:160) by Adh-Dhahabi.

134

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

As for the rational evidences to negate making similarities
between the Creator and the creation:
Then these comprise various angles:
Firstly, we say that it is not possible to liken between the
Creator and the created in any circumstance; if there was
no difference between them other than the basis of their
existence, it is enough. This is because the existence of the
Creator is necessary; it is ageless and eternal, whereas the
existence of creation is preceded with non-existence, and
will be met with annihilation. So when they are like that, it
is not possible to say they are similar.
Secondly: We find a tremendous distinction between the
Creator and creation, in His Attributes and actions. In His
Attributes, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, Hears every
voice, no matter how hidden or far it is. Even if it is within
the deepest depths of the seas; Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, certainly hears it.
Allah, the Exalted, revealed, saying:

4 Indeed Allah has heard the statement o f her that

plains to Allah. Allah hears the arguments between you
both. Verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer^ (AlMujadilah 58:1)
'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "A ll praise is
due to Allah whose hearing encompasses the voices. I was

hidden from me.''^1' And Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
heard her from above His Throne, and Allah, the Exalted,
heard her on His Throne, and between Him and her, there
was a distance that is not known to anybody except Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime. Hence, it is not possible to say His
Hearing is like our hearing.
Thirdly: We say, we know that Allah is distinct from
creation in His Self.

$ H is K u rsi exten ds ov er the heaven s an d the e a r t h } (AlB aqarah 2:255),

} A n d on the D ay o f R esu rrection the w hole o f the earth

It is not possible for any creature to be like this. Therefore,
when He is distinct from creation in His Self, and the
Attributes are of the Self - He, the Mighty and Sublime, will
be distinct from creation in His Attributes. Therefore, it is
not possible to draw a comparison between the Creator
and the creation.
Fourthly: We say; among creation, we witness things that
are the same in name, but different in what is named.
People are different in their attributes; this one has strong
sight, and this one weak, this one has strong hearing, and
this one weak, and this one has a strong body, and this one

Reported by Al-Bukhari - with a disconnected chain - form.
See Al-Fath (13:372), and Ahmad had reported it with a
connected chain in Al-M usnad (6:46), and Ibn Majah (188)
with this wording, and Ibn Majah also reported it (2063)
with the wording: "Blessed."

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

136

weak, and this one is a male, and this one a female. And
these are distinctions that exist in creatures of the same
type. So what do you think will be the difference between
creatures that are of different types? The difference
between them is much more obvious. And due to this, it
is not possible for someone to say: "M y hand is like the
hand of a camel/' or, "I have a hand like that of an ant/' or,
"I have a hand like that of a cat.'' Now, we have a man,
camel, ant and a cat; each of them has a hand that is
different from the other, even though they (the hands) bear
the same name. Thus, we say: If it is possible that there can
be differences between what is named in creatures, while
there is agreement in the name, then its possibility between
the Creator and the creation is more worthy. Rather, we say
the distinction between the Creator and the created is not
merely a possibility, but a necessity. So we have four
rational angles to proving that it is not possible that the
Creator be sim ilar to any of His creation, in any
circumstance.
We may also say, there is evidence in Fitrah (inborn
inclination). And this is due to the fact that man, in his
inborn inclination, without any distortion, recognizes the
distinction between the Creator and creation. If not for this
inborn inclination (Fitrah), he would not go on calling upon
the Creator.
Now, it becomes clear that Tamthil is negated by textual
proofs, rational proofs and the proof of Fitrah.
If somebody says: "The Prophet ($^) related some Hadiths
that are not clear to us, do they include Tamthil or not? And
we shall put these before you; the Prophet (#;) said:

We say: We reply regarding this Hadith, and its like, with

The first is the summarized reply: That it is never possible

If there occurs anything that makes you think there is a
contradiction, according to your understanding, then know
that this is not because of the text, but based upon what is
in you. If to you, there is a contradiction in texts of the Book
and the Sunnah, it is either because of having little
knowledge, deficient understanding, or inadequate re­
search and reflection. If you researched and pondered it,

you would discover that there is no basis for the contra­
diction which you erroneously imagined.
Or, it is a result of a bad objective and intention, such as
holding to what appears contradictory just to establish a
contradiction, without giving consideration to a harmoni­
zation (of facts), as do those in whose hearts there is a
deviation, who follow that which is not entirely clear (of
the texts).
As a branch of this summarized answer, it follows that it is
obligatory upon you to refer the texts that are not so clear,
to the texts that are entirely clear, whenever you discover
that which is not so clear; because this is the path of those
who are firmly grounded in knowledge. Allah, the Exalted,
says:

4 “ It is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it
are kyat that are entirely clear, they are the foundations
of the Book; and others not entirely clear. So as for
those in whose hearts there is a deviation, they follow
that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking AlFitnah (polytheism and trials, etc.), and seeking for its
hidden meanings, but none knows its hidden meanings
save Allah. And those who are firmly grounded in
knowledge say: “We believe in it; all of it (clear and
unclear Ayat) is from our Lord." And none receive
admonition except men of understanding''4 (Al 'Imran
3:7)

becomes entirely clear.
As for detailed answer, we would reply about the text, and

"You shall definitely see your Lord as you see the moon,
on a night that it is full, you will have no trouble in seeing
Him."
is not a comparison between what is seen, but it is a
comparison between the seeing. What is being said is: "as
you see the moon, on a night that it is full." Therefore, the
comparison is between the act of seeing, and not between
what is seen. What is intended is you shall see Him clearly,
just as you see the moon on the night of the full moon. That
is why he followed it with his statement: "you will not have
to crowd to see H im " or "You will have no trouble in
seeing H im ." Therefore, the confusion is removed now.
The Prophet (#1) said:
dl»
"Verily, Allah created Adam in His image" [1]
— An image is the representation of another. It cannot be
comprehended that an image is anything else other than a
representation of another. (Supposing) for example, I write
a paper for you, and you take a picture of it with a camera,
it will come out on paper. Then, it will be said: "This is the
picture of this," there is no difference in terms of the letters
f1'

Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him.

and words. An image is, therefore, a match of another
image, and the one who said: "Allah created Adam in His
image” is the Messenger (sg) the most knowledgeable, the
most truthful, the best of those who admonish, and the
most eloquent.
The summarized response is that we say that it is not
possible that this Hadith contradicts the statement of Allah,
the Exalted:

iT h ere is nothing like unto H im } (Ash-Shura 42:11)
If Allah makes it easy for you to harmonize between them,
then, harmonize. If it is not easy, then say:

}W e believe in it, all o f it is from our Lord} (Al 'Imran
3:7)
Our creed is that Allah does not have a likeness; and with
this you can be safe before Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
Here is the statement of Allah, and here is the statement of
His Messenger; each is the truth. It is not possible that one
belies the other, because each is information, not a ruling
that can be said to have been abrogated. Thus, I say: One
refutes a form of similarity while the other affirms it. So
say: "Certainly, there is nothing like Allah, and Allah
created Adam in His image.” This is the statement of Allah,
while that is the statement of His Messenger. Each is truth
that we believe in. We say: "A ll of it is from our Lord” and
remain silent. This is the best that you can do.
As for the detailed response, we say: The one who said:
"V erily, Allah created Adam in His im age” is the
Messenger of Him who said: iT h ere is nothing like H im }

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

141

(Ash-Shura 42:11) It is not possible for the Messenger to
utter what belies the One who sent him. And the one
who said: "H e created Adam in His image” is also the
one who said: "Indeed, the first group to enter Paradise
shall enter in the image of the m oon.''11' Do you think
that these people that shall enter Paradise shall be in the
image of the moon completely? Or that they shall be in
the image of a human being, but they are in the image of
the moon in terms of clearness, handsomeness, beauty
and circularity?
If you are of the first opinion, it means they shall enter
(Paradise) without eyes, noses and mouths. If we wish, we can
say: They shall enter (Paradise) as stones. If you are of the
second opinion, then the confusion has vanished and it
becomes clear that - when something is in the image of another
thing it does not necessitate that it is like it in all respects.
If you cannot comprehend this, and say: "I don't under­
stand from this except that they are similar,” we say that
there is another response. And that is: The reference here is
just a form of reference, where the creature is referred to the
Creator. His statement - "In His image” is like His saying
regarding Adam:

iA n d I breathed into him (his) soul created by Me£
(Sad 38:72)
It is not possible that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, gave
Adam a part of His soul; rather, what is intended here is the
soul that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, created. But, its
particular reference to Allah is out of honor. Such as when we
Reported by Al-Bukhari (3254) and Muslim (2834) from Abu
Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

142

say the "slaves of Allah," this includes the disbeliever, the
Muslim, the believer, the martyr, the truthful one, and the
Prophet. But if we say, "Muhammad, the slave of Allah," this
is a special reference, it is unlike the earlier mentioned
servitude. Thus, His saying: "H e created Adam in His
im age" means, an image among the images which Allah
created and gave shape. As Allah, the Exalted, said:

iA nd surely, We created you (you father Adam) and
then gave you shape, then We told the Angels,
"prostrate to Adam"'} (ATA'raf 7:11)
The one who was given shape is Adam; therefore, he is in
the image of Allah - meaning; it is Allah who gave him this
image, that is considered the best of all images of among
the creatures.

iVerily, We created man of the best stature} (At-Tin
95:4)

Allah's referral of the image to Himself, is a referral of
honor. It is as if He, the Mighty and Sublime, is showing
concern for this image, and it is for this reason, that the face
should not be struck, marring it physically, nor disgracing
by saying: "M ay Allah disgrace your face," while his face
resembles yours; you should not therefore, disgracing it in
meaning. So because it is the image Allah gave shape and
referred to Himself in esteem and honor, do not therefore,
bring disgrace to it physically or in meaning.
Then, can this response be considered a form of Tahrif or is
there something else like it?
We reply: There is something else like it, as in "the House

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

143

of Allah," "the Camel of Allah," "the Servant of Allah,"
because this image (of Adam) is clearly separate from
Allah, and everything that Allah has referred to Himself
while it is clearly separate from Him, then it is one of His
creatures, and so, the confusion is removed.
But, if someone says: "W hich of them is the safer of the
meanings, the first or the second?"
We say: The first is much safer as long as we find a support
for it in the Arabic Language, and the possibility in accord
with the intellect. Then it is necessary that the statement be
interpreted based upon it. We have found that it is not
necessary that an image should be a complete representa­
tion of another. Therefore, the safest view is to interpret it
based upon its obvious meaning.
If you say: "W hat is the image of Allah in which Adam is
created?" We reply: Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has a
Face, an Eye, Hand and Foot, the Mighty and Sublime, but it
is not imperative that these be similar to that of humans.
While there is a form of resemblance, but it is not a similarity,
as there is a resemblance between the first group to enter
Paradise and the moon, but without being the same.
With this, the position of the People of the Sunnah and the
Jama'ah becomes verified. That is, all the Attributes of
Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, are not the same as the
attributes of the creatures; without Tahnf, nor Ta'til, nor
Takyif, nor Tamthil.
We hear in many books that we read (regarding this issue)
mentioning Tashbih. They mention Tashbih referring to
Tamthil. Which of these (two expressions) is better? That we
use Tashbih or Tamthil? To use Tamthil is better:
Firstly: Because the Qur'an uses this expression:

144

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4There is nothing like unto Himfy (Ash-Shura 42:11)
Ij\JljI

i j L i f 'X-if'

ijh e n , do not set up rivals unto Allah (in worship)f
(Al-Baqarah 2:22)
And other Aydt like that.
And all of what is expressed in the Qur'an, then it is better
than other than it; because we will not find anything more
eloquent than the Qur'an, and more straight-forward to the
intended meaning than it. Allah knows better what He
intends in His statement, therefore, what agrees with the
Qur'an is the most correct. Therefore, we mention a negation
of Tamthil. And this is the same in every place, this is because
employing the expression used by the Qur'an is better than
using any other expression that is just a synonym.
Secondly: To some people, Tashbih means the affirmation
of the Attributes. That is why they call the People of the
Sunnah "the People of Tashbih.” If we therefore, say:
"without Tashbih”, the man will not understand from the
term Tashbih except affirming the Attributes. It will there­
fore become as if what we were saying to him is "without
the affirmation of Attributes.'' The meaning of Tashbih will
therefore indicate a false meaning. So for this reason
avoiding it is better.
Thirdly: To negate Tashbih in its entirety is not correct,
because there are no two things among entities or
attributes, except that they share something together
between them. This commonality is a type of resemblance.
If you therefore negate Tashbih absolutely, you are (by that)
negating everything wherein there is a form of resemblance
between the Creator and the creature. For example,
existence: Both the Creator and the creature primarily

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

145

share this together. This is a form of commonality, and a
form of resemblance, but there is a difference between the
two kinds of existence. The existence of the Creator is
necessary while the existence of the creature is possible.
The same with hearing; there is a form of commonality.
Humans have hearing, while there is hearing for the
Creator, but there is a difference between them, while at the
same time there is a commonality.
If we say: "W ithout Tashbih'' thereby making an absolute
negation of Tashbih, a complication will accrue from this.
With this, we realize that the expression "w ithout Tamthil''
is better for three reasons.
If you ask: "W hat is the difference between Takyif and
Tamthil?''
The response is that the difference is from two angles:
The first: Tamthil is the act of mentioning an attribute
together with its like. Like when you say: "The hand of soand-so is like the hand of so-and-so.” Takyif is the act of
mentioning an attribute without mentioning its like. Such
as when you say: "The how of the hand of so-and-so is
such-and-such."
Based on this, we say whoever engages in Tamthil has also
engaged in Takyif but not the other way around.
The second: Takyif will not occur except regarding an
attribute or a shape, whereas Tamthil can occur in these, as
well as in numbering, as in His statement - Exalted is He:

4lt is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the
earth the like thereof4 (At-Taldq 6 5 :12)
(Like thereof) meaning, in number.

Rather, they believe that Allah, Glorious is H e: $There is

•

Concerning his saying: "Rather, they believe that
Allah, Glorious is He, iThere is nothing like Him; and
He is the All-Hearer, the A ll-S eer.y (Ash-Shura 42:11)

Commentary
❖

His saying: "Rather, they believe" - M eaning; the People
of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah acknowledge and testify
Allah is such, that there is nothing like Him, as He said
about Himself:

iThere is nothing like unto Him)> (Ash-Shura 42:11)
So here He negated similarity; then He affirmed hearing
and seeing. He negated a defect, then He affirmed
perfection, because the negation of a defect should come
before the affirmation of perfection. This is why it is said:
"Evacuation comes before beautification.” The negation of
a defect should be started with first, after which the
affirmation of perfection is mentioned.
The word "nothing” is an indefinite pronoun, which is
used to negate, and therefore is all inclusive. Nothing is
ever like Him, the Mighty and Sublime. Meaning any
creature however tremendous it is, it is not like Allah - the
Mighty and Sublime - because to liken what is not perfect

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

147

(to something else) shows that such is imperfect. Even, if a
comparison is made between an imperfect (object) and the
perfect, it makes the perfect imperfect, as it is said:
Do you not see that it diminishes the importance o f a spear
Once it is said that the spear was made from a stick
If we say here that Allah, the Exalted, has a likeness, that
will necessitate a defect in Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
So due to this, we say that Allah negated any likeness to
His creatures from Himself, because likeness to the creature
is a kind of imperfection and defect. This is because the
creature is imperfect, and likening what is perfect to what is
imperfect, makes the perfect imperfect. Even, an ordinary
comparison between them makes it imperfect, unless it is
used as a challenge, as in the saying of the Exalted:

}Is Allah better, or (all) that you ascribe as partners (to
H im )?} (An-Naml 27:59)
And His saying:

}D o you know better or does A llah?} (Al-Baqarah 2:140)
❖

There is in His saying:

4 There is nothing like H im };
a clear refutation against those who claim that Allah,
Glorious and Exalted is He, has a likeness.
The argument of these people is "The Qur'an is Arabic, and
since it is Arabic, then Allah, the Exalted, has addressed us
in a way that we understand. It is not possible that Allah

148

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

has addressed us in a way we do not understand, and
Allah, the Exalted, has addressed us, saying that He has a
Face, that He has an Eye, that He has two Hands, and other
than that. And by the dictates of the Arabic Language, we
can understand nothing about these, except what we
witness. Based upon this, it is necessary that the meanings
these words indicate are the same as their indication
among creatures. A hand is a hand, an eye is an eye, a face
is a face, and so on. We only say that because we have a
proof."
There is no doubt that this argument is baseless; what
makes it so is the clarification that preceded, that there is no
likeness for Allah, and we say that Allah, the Exalted,
addressed us about His Attributes as He did, but we have
certain knowledge that this attribute is in accord with what
is described. The proof of this is contained in what is
witnessed. It is said that a camel has a hand, and an ant has
a hand. Nobody will understand that the hand we attribute
to the camel is the same hand attributed to an ant! This is
the case with creatures; what about descriptions of the
Creator? Definitely, the distinction will be more obvious
and more evident.
Based on this, the position of those who claim Tamthil is
refuted with intellect, just as it is refuted with revealed
texts.
❖

Allah, the Exalted, said:

$He is All-Hearer and All-Seer
So He, Glorious and Exalted is He, affirmed for Himself,
hearing and seeing, to clarify His perfection, and degrading
the idols that are worshipped besides Him. For the idols

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

149

that are worshipped besides Him do not hear; and even if
they hear, they cannot reply, and they do not see, as Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, said:

4Those whom they invoke besides Allah have not created
anything, but they are themselves created. They are
dead, lifeless, and they know not when they will be
raised up4 (An-Nahl 16: 20, 21)
They do not possess hearing, nor intellect, nor vision. And
if it were assumed that they possess such, they cannot
respond.

4And who is more astray than one who calls besides
Allah, such as will not answer him till the Day o f
Resurrection, and who are (even) unaware o f their calls
to them^ (Al-Ahqaf 46:5)
The People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah therefore believe
in a negation of any likeness for Allah, because that is a
defect, and they affirm hearing and seeing for Him based
upon His saying:

4 There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the AllHearer and A ll-Seer} (Ash-Shura 42:11)
The fruit of a person's faith in this, is that it leads the
servant to give Him the utmost reverence, because there is
nothing like Him among the creatures. So, exalt this

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Magnificent Lord that does not have an equal; or else there

iT h ere is nothing like unto Him $
When you believe that He is the All-Hearer, you will soon
be cautious regarding every statement that angers Allah,
because you know that He hears you, and you fear His
punishment. You will soon avoid every statement that
involves disobedience of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
because you believe He is the All-Hearer. If this belief does
not make this happen to you, know that your belief that
Allah as the All-Hearer, is without a doubt, deficient.
If you truly believe that Allah is the All-Hearer, you would
not say anything except that which pleases Him, particu­
larly when you are talking about His Shan ah, as in the case
of a M ufti or a scholar. For this is indeed worse. Allah,
Glorious is He, says:

iT hen who does more wrong than one who invents a lie
against Allah, to lead mankind astray without knowl­
edge. Certainly Allah guides not the people who are
Zdlimin (wrongdoers)$ (Al-An'am 8:144)
Indeed this is among the worst forms of wrongdoing. That
is why He said:

4 Verily! Allah guides not the people who are Zalimin
(wrongdoers)$ (Al-Ahqdf 46:10)
This is among the punishments for the one who gives

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

151

religious verdicts without knowledge; that he will not be
guided, because he is a wrongdoer.
Be warned my brother Muslim, against saying anything
that does not please Allah, whether you say that regarding
Allah, or otherwise.
The fruit of the belief that Allah is the All-Seer, is that you
will not do anything that angers Allah, because you know
that whenever you are looking at something that is
prohibited, while the people do not know it is an unlawful
glance, Allah, the Exalted sees this glance, and He knows
what is in your heart:

4;Allah knows the fraud o f the eyes, and all that the
breasts conceal$ (Ghafir 40:19)
When you believe in this, it is not possible that you ever do
anything that does not please Him.
You should be shy before Allah, as you are shy before the
nearest of the people to you, the most respected of them
before you. Therefore, if we believe that Allah is the All-Seer,
we will soon guard against every action that will lead to
angering Allah; otherwise, our faith in that will be deficient.
If somebody points with his finger, his lip, his eye, or his
head, to something that is unlawful, while the people
around him are unaware, Allah, the Exalted, sees him.
Whoever believes in Him, then he should beware of this. If
we believe in what is implicated by Allah's Names and
Attributes, then we would have a complete state of
steadfastness (Istiqamah) among ourselves. And Allah is
the One whose Help is sought.

Concerning His saying: "They do not negate what He
describes Himself with, and they do not distort the words
from their places."

Commentary
❖

His saying: "They do not negate what He describes
Himself w ith:" meaning; the People of the Sunnah and
the Jama ah do not deny from Allah what He described
Himself with, because they follow the text, in negating
and affirming. They affirm all of what Allah affirmed
for Himself, in reality, and they do deny what He
described Himself with, whether it is among the
Attributes of Essence (Dhat) or the Attributes of doing.

Attributes of Essence (Dhat), are those such as living,
power, knowledge, and others like that. These are divided
into Attributes of Essence in meaning (Al-Ma'nawiyah), and
Attributes of Essence derived from revealed information
(Al-Khabariyah). These are the ones that we find names for
in some or parts of us, such as the hand, the face and the
eye; the scholars refer to them as Dhatiyyah Al-Kliabariyyah
(Atributes of Essence in revealed information). Dhatiyyah;
because they are not separable, never ceasing with Allah,
and Allah has never ceased to be described with them. AlKhabariyyah; because they were conveyed by information
(Khabar); the intellect cannot prove them. If Allah had not

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

153

informed us that He has a Hand, we could not have known
that, but we were informed of it. But the case of knowledge,
hearing and seeing, is different, our intellect can compre­
hend this in accord with textual evidences. Thus, we say,
regarding these Attributes; the Hand, the Face and their
like, that they are Dhatiyyah Khabariyyah (Attributes derived
from revealed information). We do not say they are
portions or parts. We rather avoid this expression, while
in our case, they are portions and parts. This is because the
parts and portions can be separated from the whole. But
the Lord, the Mighty and Subliime is such, that it cannot be
imagined that any of these Attributes which He describes
Himself with - such as the Hand - could ever cease, because
He always was and will be described with them. That is
why we do not say they are portions or parts.
The Attributes of doing (Al-Fa'liyyah) are those that are
related to His will; He does them if He so wills, and does
not, if He so wills. Earlier we mentioned that among the
Attributes of doing are those that have causes, and others
that do not have causes, and there are those that are both of
Essence (Dhatiyyah) and doing (Fa'liyyah).
❖

Concerning his statement: "and they do not distort the
words from their places:" what is intended by "w ords"
here is Allah's word and His Messenger's word.

They do not distort it (the word) from its place: meaning;
from what it proves. For example His statement:

$N ay, both His hands are e x t e n d e d (A l-M aidah 5:64),
They (the People of the Sunnah) say: It refers to Hand, in
reality, that is affirmed for Allah, without Takyif or Tamthil.
The people of Tahrif say: "It refers to His power or His
favor." As for the People of the Sunnah, they say power is

154

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

one thing, while the Hand is another, favor is one thing,
while the Hand is another. They do not distort the words
from places, because Tahrif is the practice of the Jews:

4Among those who are Jews, there are some who
displace words from (their) places^ (An-Nisa 4 :46)
So everyone who distorts the texts of the Book and the
Sunnah, then in him is a semblance to the Jews. Beware of
this, and do not imitate those who earned (Allah's) wrath,
some of whom Allah turned into monkeys, pigs, and
worshippers of false deities. Do not commit Tahrif, rather
explain the statement (of Allah and His Messenger) as
intended by Allah and His Messenger.
One of the sayings mentioned from Ash-Shaf'i, is: "I believe
in Allah, and what came from Allah, as intended by Allah.
And I believe in Allah's Messenger, and whatever came
from Allah's Messenger, as intended by Allah's Messen­
ger.''

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

155

The Commentary
❖

His saying: "They d o n o t en gage in Ilh ad ..." Meaning;
the People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah.

Al-Ilhad linguistically means inclination, based upon which
the term Al-Lahd is used for a grave. Because the grave
inclines to one side, and it is not (excavated) in the middle.
The (grave) that is (excavated only) in the middle is called
Shiqq, and the Lahd is better than the Shiqq.
So they do not engage in Ilhad regarding Allah's Names,
nor do they do so regarding His Ayat. The author, may
Allah have mercy upon him, thus indicates for us that Ilhad
can occur in two areas: In the Names and in the Ayat. What
the author has indicated in his statement is also proven in
the Qur'an; Allah, the Exalted, says:
E

}A n d to Allah alone belong all perfect attributes. So call
on Him by these attributes. And leave alone those who
deviate from the right way with respect to His attri­
butes. They shall be requited fo r what they do'} (AlA'rdf 7:180)
Here, Allah confirms that Ilhad is committed regarding His
Names.
He, the Exalted, said:

} Surely, those who distort Our Signs to seek deviation
therein, are not hidden from U s} (Fussilat 41:40)
So Allah also confirms that Ilhad is committed regarding
His Ayat.

156

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Ilhdd with the Names is an inclination away from what is
required regarding them. And there are different types of it:
The first type: To name Allah with what He did not name
Himself, as the philosophers call Him, "the cause of
action," and the Christians refer to Him as the father, and
they refer to 'Isa as the son. This is a form of llhdd regarding
His Names. In the same way, if a person names Allah with
any name that He did not name Himself; then he is a
Mulhid with Allah's Names. The reason for this is that
Allah's Names are Tawqifiyyah
It is not possible for us to
affirm any of that for Him except as been affirmed by a text.
If you, therefore, call Allah what He has not called Himself,
you have thus committed Ilhdd and deviated from what is
required.
Calling Allah with what He did not call Himself is a form
of disrespect for Allah, an act of wrongdoing, and a
transgression against His right, because if somebody were
to call you with a name that is not yours, you will consider
him to have transgressed against you and wronged you.
This is the case of the creature, then how about the
Creator?!
Therefore, you do not have any right to name Allah what
He did not name Himself. If you do that, you have
committed Ilhdd with Allah's Names.
The second type is to reject any of Allah's Names, the
opposite of the first type. So in the first category, Allah was
named with what He did not name Himself, while this
category strips Allah of what He calls Himself, rejecting the
Name, whether he rejects all the Names or some of those
which Allah affirmed for Himself; once he rejects them, he
[11

(Translation note): That is; it must be based on textual proofs
from the Qur'an and Sunnah.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

157

has committed llhad with them.
The basis of llhad here, is that since Allah affirmed them
(the Names) for Himself; it is obligatory upon us to affirm
them for Him. If we negate them, that is considered llhad,
and an inclination aw ay from w hat is com pulsory
regarding them.
There are some people who deny Allah's Names such as
the extreme Jahmfs. They say that Allah never has a Name.
They say that if you give Him a name, you have likened
Him to the creatures. It is known that this view is baseless
and rejected.
The third type is to reject the Attributes that are proven by
the Names. Such a person affirms the Name, but rejects the
Attribute that is included in this Name. Such as saying that
Allah is All-Hearer, but without hearing; the All-Knower,
but without knowledge; the Creator, but without creation;
the All-Powerful, but without power...This is popular with
the Mu'tazilah. It is something that is unintelligible.
Then, they consider these Names ordinary labels, one
different from the other, the All-Hearer is different from the
All-Knower, but all of them do not have meaning. The AllHearer does not indicate hearing, while the All-Knower
does not indicate knowledge; but they are only labels.
Among them are also others, who say that all these Names
are one. He is the All-Knower, the All-Hearer, and the AllSeer, all of them are one. They are not different, except with
respect to their letter construction. They consider all the
Names as one! All of this is unintelligible. That is why we
say it is not possible to believe in the Names (of Allah) until
we affirm the Attributes that they include.
Perhaps here, we should discuss indications of the Names.
There are three types of indications: Complete indications,

158

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

inclusive indications, and denotative indications.
1. A complete indication is when an expression indicates
every implication. Based on this, every name indicates
who is named by it, that is Allah, as well as the
Attribute derivable from the Name.
2. Inclusive indication refers to the case w hen an
expression indicates some of its implications. Based
on this, the Name indicates one essence, or one
attribute from the implied indications.
3. A denotative indication is an indication for something
that is understood, not from the expression of the
Name, but from what it denotes. For this reason we call
it a denotative indication.
For example, the Name Al-Khdliq (the Creator) is a word
that indicates Allah personally, and the Attribute of
creating. Therefore, since the idea indicates both of these
matters, it is called a complete indication, because the
expression proves all of what it indicates, and there is no
doubt that when you say Al-Khdliq then you understand
that He is a creator and He creates. When it is used for "the
Creator" only, or that He creates only, then it is called an
inclusive indication, because it indicates some of its
meanings.
In the case of knowledge and power, it is called a
denotative indication; since it is not possible that He
creates except with knowledge and power; so its indication
of power and knowledge is a denotative indication.
So here, it becomes clear, that if a person rejects one of these
indications, then he is a Mulhid regarding the Name.
Should such a person say: "I believe that Al-Khdliq (the
Creator) indicates the Self of Allah, and the attribute of
creating, but it does not indicate the attributes of knowl­
edge and power." We say this is also a form of Ilhdd. It is

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

159

obligatory upon us to affirm all of what a name indicates.
To reject any attribute indicated by the Name is regarded as
a form of Ilhad with that Name; whether the indication for
this Attribute is complete, inclusive, or denotative.
Let us cite a perceptible example with which all of these
indications will be made clear. If I say I have a house. In the
word "house" each of these three indications are present.
You will understand that the word indicates the entire
house, in a complete manner, and it can indicate the men's
sitting place alone. It can also indicate the bathrooms, or
the hallway, as an inclusive indication. This is because all of
these things are part of the house, and the expression that
indicates part of its meaning is an inclusive indication.
Denotatively, it also indicates that there was a bricklayer
who built the house, because there is no house except it
was built by a bricklayer.
The fourth type of Ilhad concerning (Allah's) Names, is to
affirm Names and Attributes for Allah while considering
them to indicate Tamthil. That is, to indicate that (Allah's)
seeing is like our seeing, and knowledge like knowledge,
and forgiveness like our forgiveness, and similar to that.
This is a form of Ilhad, because it is an inclination away
from what is obligatory regarding them (the Names), since
what is obligatory is to affirm them without Tamthil.
The fifth type is to use them (the Names of Allah) for the
idols, or to derive names from them for the idols. For
example, referring to something that is worshipped as AlIlah (the Deity). This is a form of Ilhad. Or, to derive names
from them for idols, such as Al-Lat from Al-Ilah, AT'Uzza
from Al-'Aziz and Mannah from Al-Mannan. We say this is a
form of Ilhad with Allah's Names, because what is
obligatory upon you is to use Allah's Names specifically
for Him, and not to transgress and go beyond the bounds

160

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

such that you derive names for the others that are
worshipped from them.
These are the types of llhad regarding the Names of Allah.
The People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah never commit llhad
with Allah's Names. Rather, they abide by them as Allah,
Glorious and Exalted is He, intended them. They also affirm
all of what is indicated by them, because what is contrary to
that to be llhad.
As for llhad regarding the Ayat of Allah, the Exalted, then
Ayat is plural of Ayah, and it is a sign which distinguishes
something from other than it. And Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, dispatched the Messengers with Ayat (Signs) not
miracles. Therefore, the idea of Ayat is better than the idea
of miracles (Al-Mu'jizat).
Firstly: Because Ayat is what is used in the Book and the
Sunnah.
Secondly: Because miracles can be performed by sorcerers
and magicians and others like them.
Thirdly: The word Ayat better expresses the intended
meaning than the word "m iracles" (Al-Mu'jizat). The Ayat
of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, are the signs that prove
the existence of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. Therefore
they are His, specifically. If it were not specific (to Him), it
would not be considered an Ayah of His.
The Ayat of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, are divided
into two categories: Universal Ayat and Shar'iah (Legisla­
tive) Ayat.
Universal Ayat are those that are related to creation and
universal matters. For example, His saying:

$A nd from among his Ayat are the night and the day,

and the sun and the moon$ (Fussilat 41:37)
And His saying:

4And among His Ayat is the creation o f the heavens
and the earth, and the difference o f your languages and
colors. Verily, in that are indeed Ayat fo r men o f sound
knowledge. And among His Ayat is the sleep that takes
you by night and by day, and your seeking o f His
Bounty. Verily, in that are indeed Ayat fo r a people
who listen. And among His Ayat is He shows you the
lightning, by way o f fear and hope, and He sends down
water from the sky, and therewith revives the earth after
its death. Verily, in that are indeed Ayat fo r a people
who understand. And among His Ayat is that the
heaven and earth stand by His Command, then after­
wards when He will call you by a single call, behold,
you will come out from the earthy (Ar-Rum :22-25)
These are universal Ayat. If you like; say universally

have any control, nor share, nor do they bring aid (to
Allah); but they are intercessors," - He says:

4 Intercession with Him profits not, except fo r him
whom He permits4 (Saba' 34:23)
So He severed every cause that the polytheists clung too.
The second category of Ayat are the Shar'i (Legislative)
Ayat.

They are the revelations with which the Messengers came,
such as the Magnificent Qur'an; and it is an Ayah, due to
His, the Exalted, saying:

4These are the Ayat o f Allah, We recite them to you in
truth, and surely, you are one o f the Messengers4 (AlBaqarah 2:252)

4And they say: "Why are not Ayat sent down to him
from his Lord? S ay: "The Ayat are only with Allah,
and I am only a plain w am er. Is it not sufficient fo r
them that We have sent down to you the Book which is
recited to them?4 (Al-'Ankabiit 29:50-51)
So He called it “Ayat."
Ilhad with them could be either in the form of belying them,
distorting them (Tahrif), or opposing them.
Belying them is that it be said: "This is not from Allah"

164

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

belying it fundamentally, or, to belie what is informed of in
it, while believing in it fundamentally. So he says, for
example: "The story of the people of the Al-Kahf (the Cave)
is not authentic” and "The story of the owners of the
Elephant is not authentic, Allah never sent flocks of birds
against them.”
As for distortion (Tahrif), then it is to alter its expression, or
to change its meaning from what Allah and His Messenger
intended. For example, to say: "Rose over the Throne'
means 'conquered,'” or to say: "The meaning of 'Our Lord
descends to the low est heaven' is; 'H is com m and
descends.”'
As for opposing them , that is by abandoning the
commands and violating the prohibitions; Allah, the
Exalted said regarding Al-Masjid Al-Haram:

And whoever inclines to evil actions therein or to do
wrong, him We shall cause to taste a painful to rm en t .4
(Al-Hajj 22:25)
Every act of disobedience is a form of llhad with the Shar'iah
(Legislative) Ayat, because by it one exits from what is
obligated by it; since it is obligatory upon us to implement
the commands and avoid the prohibitions, so if you do not
do that, then this is llhad.

"They do not engage in Takyif, nor likening His Attributes
to attributes o f His creation; because H e, Glorious is He, is
such that there is none similar to Him, and no co-equal to
Him, and no rival fo r Him, and H e, Glorious and Exalted is
He, is not comparable to His creation."

•

Concerning his statement: "They do not engage in
Takyif, nor likening His Attributes to attributes o f His
creation; because He, Glorious is H e, is such that there is
none similar to Him, and no co-equal to Him, and no rival
fo r Him, and He Glorious and Exalted is He, is not
comparable to His creation."

The Commentary
❖

His statem ent: "They do not engage in Takyif."
Meaning; the People of Sunnah and the Jama ah. It
preceded that Takyif is to mention the how of an
Attribute, whether you mention it with your tongue or
in your heart. The People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah
never commit Takyif. That is, they do not say: "The how
of His Hand, is like this and that,” nor: "The how of His
Face is like this and that.” So they do not commit Takyif
with the tongue; nor do they do so with the heart,
meaning; the person's soul does not imagine how
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, rose over the Throne,
or how He descends, or how is His Face, or how is His
Hand. It is also not permissible to try (imagining) that
because this will lead to one of these two matters: either
Tamthil or Ta'til.

166

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

That is why it is not permissible for a person to try to know
the how of Allah's rising over the Throne, or saying it with
his tongue. Rather, he should not ask about its how,
because Imam Malik, may Allah have mercy upon him,
said: "Asking about it is an innovation.” Do not say: "H ow
did He rise?” "H ow did He descend?” "H ow will He
come?” "H ow is His Face?” If you do that, we say you are
an innovator. The evidence that Takyif is unlawful has
preceded, and we mentioned the textually revealed, and
intellectual evidences for that.
❖

His saying: "they do not liken” Meaning the People of
the Sunnah and the Jama'ah. "His attribute to the
attributes of His creation." This is the meaning of his
earlier statement: "nor Tamthil (likening)" We men­
tioned the impermissibility of Tamthil earlier, from both
textually revealed, and intellectual proofs. And that
textually revealed proofs include both declarative and
imperative statements negating Tamthil. So they do not
commit Takyif nor Tamthil.

❖

His statement: "because He, Glorious is H e," - the word
Subhdn is the infinitive of Sabaha and Tasbih. Therefore,
Subhdn has the meaning of Tasbih (Glorification), but
with a different expression.

The meaning of "Sabbaha” (He glorifies) as said by the
scholars is "To keep away from.” The word Sabaha has its
root from Subhu which means "fam ess;" thus, it means to
distance any deficient trait from Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime. So He, Glorious is He and Exalted, is far from
every imperfection.
❖

His statement: "there is none similar to Him.” The
evidence for this, is His saying:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

167

4;Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is
between them, so worship Him (Alone) and be constant
and patient in His worship. Do you know of any who is
similar to Him$ (Maryam 19:65)
Hal (Do) is an interrogative, but with the meaning of a
negation. The negation is expressed by an interrogative due
to a tremendous benefit; and that is that it is a challenge.
Because, here, there is a distinction; if I were to say: "There
is nothing similar to H im " and;

4Do you know of any who is similar to Him)>
This is because;

4Do you know of any who is similar to Him$>
includes a negation and a challenge together, so it infers the
meaning of challenge. This is an important principle;
whenever a rhetorical question is used with the meaning
of negation, then it has the inference of a challenge. It is as
if I am saying: "If you are truthful, bring me something
similar to H im ." Based on this,

4Do you know of any who is similar to Him4
is more intense than "There is nothing similar to H im ."
❖

His statement; " and no co-equal to Him ," and the
evidence for this, is His, the Exalted, saying:

168

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

$And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him^
(.Al-Ikhlds 112:4)
❖

His statement: "and no rival for H im ;" the evidence for
this is:

$Then, do not set up rivals unto Allah while you
knowfy (Al-Baqarah 2:22)
Meaning, you know that He does not have any rival. And
An-Nidd (rival) means "peer."
These three words: As-Samt (likeness) Al-Kuf (co-equal)
and An-Nidd (rival) are very much synonymous, because
the meaning of Al-Kuf refers to the one who suffices for the
other, and nothing will suffice in place of another except its
like. If it is not its like, it would not be sufficient in its place.
Therefore, there is no K u f for Him; meaning, there is
nothing like Him, Glorious and Exalted is He. The objective
of this negation is to indicate the perfection of His
Attributes, since due to His Attributes' perfection, nothing
is like Him.
❖

His saying: "He, Glorious and Exalted is He, is not
comparable to His creation.""

Al-Qiyds (comparison) is divided into three categories:
Comprehensive Qiyds, comparative Qiyds, and preferable
Qiyds. He, the M ighty and Sublime, should not be
compared with His creation by comprehensive Qiyds nor
comparative Qiyds.
1. Comprehensive Qiyds: This is what is known as the
general type, which covers every individual item, such
that every individual item is included in that general
basis, both in its word and meaning. For example, if we

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

2.

3.

169

say: Life; the life of Allah, the Exalted, can not be
compared with the life of His creation, because of all of
what the word "living" entails.
Comparative Qiyas: It is to rank something with its like.
So it would be to make what is affirmed for the Creator
the same as what is affirmed for the created.
Preferable Qiyas: Is when the part is more worthy of the
judgment than the basis. The scholars say that this is
used with respect to Allah, the Exalted, based on His
saying:

iA nd for Allah is the highest d e s c rip tio n (An-Nahl
16:60)
Meaning; every attribute of perfection, then for Allah is the
most exalted of them. So hearing, seeing, knowledge,
power, life, wisdom and their like - what resembles them is
found in creation, but for Allah they are the most exalted,
and most perfect.
That is why sometimes we utilize intellectual evidences
based on preferable Qiyas. For example, exaltedness is an
attribute of perfection in creation, so when it is an attribute
of perfection in the case of creation, then in the case of the
Creator, it is more worthy. We always find this in the
statements of the scholars.
Thus the statement of the author - may Allah shower
blessings on him: "He is not comparable to His creation" after
saying: "there is none similar to Him, and no co-equal to Him,
and no rival for Him,” means the Qiyas (comparison) that
determines equality, and that is comprehensive Qiyas and
comparative Qiyas.
Therefore, Qiyas between Allah, and His creation is

170

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

prohibited because of the difference between them. There­
fore, in the case of legal judgments; if we cannot make
Qiyds between what is obligatory and permissible, or what
is permissible and obligatory, then even more so when it
comes to the topic of comparing attributes between the
Creator and the creation.
If somebody says to you: "Allah exists and a person also
exists, therefore, the existence of Allah is like the existence
of the person by Qiyas."
We reply: This is not correct, because the existence of the
Creator is necessary, while the existence of the person is
possible.
Supposing he says: "I consider the hearing of the Creator
comparable to the hearing of the created." We reply: This is
not possible. The hearing of the Creator is necessary, it
cannot be considered imperfect. It covers everything.
Meanwhile, the hearing of man is a mere possibility, since
it is possible that a man be bom deaf, and the hearing
person also has some imperfection in his hearing, because
his hearing is limited. Therefore, it is not possible to
compare Allah with His creation. So it is not possible to
compare any of the Attributes of Allah with the attributes
of His creation, due to the obvious tremendous distinction
between the Creator and the created.

•

Concerning his saying: "Because He is more knowledge­
able about Himself and other than Him, and the most
truthful in speech, and better at narrating than His
creation

The Commentary
The author, may Allah have mercy upon him, said this as a
preface and introduction to the obligation of accepting
what is proven by the statements of Allah, the Exalted,
regarding His Attributes and other matters. And that is,
that it is obligatory to accept what the information proves,
when it includes four qualities:
First: That it is based upon knowledge; and he indicated
this by his saying: "Because He is more knowledgeable
about Himself and other than Him.”
The second: Truthfulness; and he indicated this by his
statement: "And the most truthful in speech.”
The third quality: Clarification and eloquence; and he
indicated it by his saying: "A nd better at narrating.”
The fourth quality: Safety of the objective and the intent;
such that the one giving the information intends guidance
by what they are being informed.
The evidence for the first, which is knowledge, is His

statement, the Exalted:

4 And your Lord is more knowledgeable o f who you are
in the heavens and earth. And indeed, W e have
preferred some o f the Prophets above others4 (Al-lsra
17:55)
So He is more knowledgeable about Himself, and other
than Him - being more knowledgeable than any other. So
He is more knowledgeable about you than you are
yourself, because He knows what will happen to you in
the future, while you do not know what you will earn
tomorrow.
The word A'lamu (more knowledgeable) is a noun of
preference. One of the scholars missed that, and interpreted
A'lamu to mean, 'Alim (knower), and he said:

4Truly your Lord is more knowledgeable o f who has
gone astray from His path, and He is the more knowl­
edgeable o f those who are guided4 (An-Nahl 16:125)
- he said that it means that He knows the one who has gone
astray from His path, and He knows those who are guided.
He said: "Because A'lamu is a noun of preference, which
infers the presence of a partnership among the preferred,
and the one preferred over him. But this is not possible in
relation to Allah, rather, 'Alim (knower) is an active subject;
it does not include co-participation nor preference."
So we say to him: This is an error. Allah, talking about
Himself, says: 4more knowledgeable4 and you are saying
"knowledgeable." If we interpret 4 more k n o w le d g e a b le to
mean "knowledgeable" we are relegating the degree of

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

173

Allah's knowledge, because others, apart from Allah, can
also be referred to as "know er” in a way that would
equate them. But 4 more knowledgeable4 dictates that
nobody is equal to Him in this knowledge. He knows
better than every knower. This, without doubt, is perfect
with respect to the Attribute.
We say to him: In the Arabic Language, the active subject
does not prevent equality of the attribute, but as for the
noun of preference, it restricts any share in what it
indicates.
We also say: It is not wrong to say, when comparing,
A'lamu (more knowledgeable), that is, to use a noun of
preference, even if it will be assumed that what is preferred
over, is not considered in that meaning, as Allah, the
Exalted, says:
i' U ,
4The dwellers o f Paradise will, on that Day, have the
best abode, and have the fairest o f places fo r repose4
(Al-Furqan 25:24)
The noun of preference (Ahsanu "best”) is used here, even
though that which is being preferred over, does not posses
anything of th atJ11
In the case of arguing with an opponent, and presenting
proofs against him, it is allowed to use a noun of
preference, even if the one being preferred over does not
possess anything of the quality of the preference. Allah, the
M (T ranslation note): M eaning, it refers to the inhabitants of
P arad ise, an d h avin g the best ab od e, w h o e v e r is n ot in
P arad ise, can n ot be said to h ave g oo d n ess of an y sort, so

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Exalted, says:

4/s Allah better, or that which they associate with
H im ?> (An-Naml 27:59)
What is known, is that what they worship (beside Him)
does not possess any goodness.
Yusuf, peace be upon him, said:

4 Are many lords differing among themselves better or
Allah, the One, the Most Supreme?$ (Yusuf 12:39)
While the lords posses no goodness.
The summary is to say, that 4more knowledgeable4, which is
mentioned in the Book of Allah, is intended to express its
real meaning. W hoever interprets it to mean 'Alim
(knower) has indeed committed an error from the view
of its meaning and on the basis of the Arabic Language.
The evidence for the second quality: Truthfulness; is in
His saying:

4And who can be more truthful than Allah in saying?4
(An-Nisa' 4:122)
Meaning; there is no one that is more truthful than He is,
and truth is that the speech reflects the reality, and no
speech reflects the reality more than that of Allah, the
Exalted. So all of what Allah informed of, it is true, rather
more true than every saying.
The evidence for the third quality - clarification and
eloquence - is His, the Exalted saying:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

175

iA n d who is more truthful in his word than A llah?}
(.An-Nisd' 4:87)
The excellence of His narrations includes excellence in
expression, as well as in meaning.
The evidence of the fourth quality: Safety of the objective
and intent, is His, the Exalted, saying:

}A llah explains this to you lest you go astray. } (AnNisd' 4:176)

}A llah desires to make clear to you, and guide you to
the path o f those before you} (An-Nisd' 4:26)
All four qualities that make it obligatory to accept
information are found together in the statements of Allah.
Thus, it is obligatory upon us to accept the statement of
Allah as it is, and that we not allow any doubt regarding
what it proves. Because Allah did speak with this speech
for the sake of leading the creation astray, rather it is
intended to make things clear for them, and to guide them.
The statements of Allah about Himself, and about others,
come from the One who is the most knowledgeable knower
of all those who speak; thus, it is not possible that it be
touched by other than the truth, and it is not possible that it
be unintelligible, rather than fluent speech. And if the Jinns
and mankind came together to produce its like, then they
would not be capable of it. So when these four qualities are
combined in speech, then it is obligatory upon the one
being addressed to accept what it indicates.

176

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-V\lasitiyyah

For example; the saying of the Exalted, while addressing
Iblis:
cJilo- U

(jl

4W hat hindered you from submitting to what I had
created with My two Hands?$ (Sad 38:75)
So it is said: In this Ayah is the affirmation of two Hands
for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime; He creates whatever He
wills with them, we therefore affirm them, because the
speech of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is based upon
knowledge and truthfulness, and His speech is the most
excellent of all speech, and the most eloquent and
clarifying. It is not possible that He does not have two
Hands, and that He wanted the people to believe that
about Him. If this is assumed, it would dictate that the
Qur'an is a form of misguidance, since it described Allah
with what He does not have, and this is not allowed. So
when this is the case, then it is obligatory upon you to
believe that Allah - the Exalted - has two Hands, with
which He created Adam.
If you say what is intended by them (the two Hands) is
favor and power;
We reply: It is not possible that this is what is intended,
unless you are so insolent against your Lord that you
describe His speech with contrary to the four qualities we
mentioned. We ask: When Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
said: <$two Handsty - did He know that He has two
Hands? He would answer: "H e knew." We would then
ask: Is He truthful? He would definitely answer: "H e is
truthful." He cannot say that He does not have knowl­
edge, or He is not truthful. He also cannot say that He
refers to them (the two hands) because of being inarticu­
late and incapable of expressing Himself. Nor can he say

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

177

that He wanted His creation to believe in Attributes that
He does not have, merely to lead them astray. We say to
him: Therefore, what prevents you from affirming two
Hands for Allah?
So, seek the forgiveness of your Lord and repent to Him,
and say: "I believe in whatever Allah, the Exalted, informs
of about Himself, because He is more knowledgeable about
Himself, and about other than Him, and He is the most
truthful in saying, and He is better in narrating than other
than Him, and His intent is more complete than other than
Him.
That is why the author, may Allah have mercy upon him,
mentioned these three qualities, while we added the fourth,
which is, the intent to clarify for the creation, and the intent
to guide them, due to His, the Exalted, saying:

iA llah desires to make clear to you, and guide you to,
the path o f those before youfy (An-Nisa 4:26)
This is the ruling concerning what Allah informs about
Himself, through His speech which comprises the four
terms related to speech.

"Then, His Messengers who are the truthful ones, those

The Commentary
❖

His saying: "Then, His Messengers who are the truthful
ones, those who were entrusted;” As-Sadiq (the truthful) is
he who informs of what reflects the reality. So every
Messenger was truthful in what they informed of.

However, there is no doubt that the chain of transmission
to the Messengers, peace be upon them, must be authentic.
If the Jews say: "M usa, peace be upon him, said so-and-so/'
we will not accept it until we know the authenticity of its
chain of transmission to Musa, peace be upon him. If the
Christians say: "Isa, peace be upon him, said so-and-so/'
we will not accept until we know the authenticity of the
chain of transmission to 'Isa, peace be upon him. If
somebody says: "Muhammad Jjfc, said so-and-so" we will
not accept it until we know the authenticity of its chain of
transmission to Muhammad
f11

And in one of the manuscripts it is: Musaddaqun.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

179

His Messengers are truthful in whatever they said; so all of
what they informed of about Allah, and about other than
Him from His creation; then they are truthful about it, and
they do not ever lie.
That is why there is a consensus among the scholars that
the Messengers, peace be upon them, are safe from lying.
❖

"M asduqun" — (those who were entrusted); and
" Musaddaqun" — (the trusted ones). There are two
manuscripts;

Based on the manuscript with "Masduqun" - those who
were entrusted, the meaning is that what was revealed to
them is the truth. The Masduq is the one informed of the
truth. The Sadiq is the one who comes with the truth. From
this is the statement of the Messenger sg to Abu Hurairah,
may Allah be pleased with him, when the Shaitan told him:
"If you recite Ayat Al-Kursi, a protector from Allah shall
continue to be with you, and no Shaitan will come near you
until the morning." He jg said to him: "H e told you the
truth but he is a liar."[1J Meaning he informed you of the
truth.
So the Messengers are Masduqun - whatever is revealed to
them is the truth. The One who sent them never belied
them, nor did the one who was sent to them - Jibrll, peace
be upon him - belie them.

f' 1 Reported by Al-Bukhari (2311) - with a disconnected chain from the Hadith of Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with
him, when the Messenger of Allah deputized him to guard
the Ramadan Zakah. And in Al-Fath (4:488) Al-Hafidh said:
"This is how Al-Bukhari cited this Hadith here, and he did
not clearly state that it was narrated to him. An-Nasa'I,
IsmaTlI and Abu Nu'aim connected it from various routes."

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

iT h at this is, surely, the word revealed to a noble
Messenger. Possessor o f strength, established in the
presence o f the Lord o f the Throne. Entitled to obedience
and faithful to his trusty (At- Takwir 81:19-21)
Regarding the version: " Musaddaqiin" (the trusted ones) it
means that it is obligatory upon their nations to trust them.
Based on this, the meaning of the Musaddaqiin is; legislatively.
That is; it is obligatory that they be trusted legislatively, so
whoever belies the Messenger, or belies them, then he is a
disbeliever. It is possible that there is another interpretation
for Musaddaqiin. That is, that Allah, the Exalted, gives
credence to them. And it is known that Allah, the Exalted
gives credence to them, by His sayings and His actions.
As for His sayings; Allah says to His Messenger, Muhammad Mi

iB u t Allah bears witness by means o f the revelation
which He has sent down to you^ (An-Nisa 4:166)
And He says:

4And Allah knows that you are His Messenger4 (AlMunafiqiin 63:1)
This is a form of giving credence by statement.
As for His giving credence by action, this is by strengthen­
ing him and manifesting the Ayat. He M, would go to
people and invite them to Islam, if they refused to accept,
they would pay the Jizyah, if they did not accept that, their
blood, women and wealth would be made lawful. Allah,
the Exalted, strengthened him and gave him victory over

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

181

land after land, until his Message reached the East and the
West of the world. So this is credence granted by Allah
through action.
In the same manner, are the Ayat that Allah manifest by his
hands, giving credence to him, whether these Ayat were
legislative or universal. As for the legislative type, he was
often asked regarding what he knew not, while Allah
would reveal the reply:

4 And they ask you concerning the Ruh (Spirit). Say:
"The Ruh is one o f the affairs o f my L ord .. ,"4(Al-Isra'
1 7 :8 5 )[1] '

Therefore, this is a confirmation that he is a Messenger. If
he were not a Messenger, Allah would not have responded:

^

Based on what is reported by Al-Bukhari (4721) from
'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him. He
said: "While I was with the Prophet ^ at a farm (of the
Ansar) and he was reclining on palm-leaf stalk, some of the
Jews passed by and some of them said to the other: 'Ask him
regarding the Ruh (Spirit).' He (another) said: 'W hat do you
need from him?' One of them said: '(Do not) lest he respond
with what you dislike' - but they said: 'Ask him.' So they
asked him regarding the soul, and the Prophet
refrained
from giving any response. Then I realized that he was
receiving revelation, so I stood by my place. When the
revelation ended he m said: And they ask you concerning
the Ruh (the Spirit); Say: "The Ruh (the Spirit) is one of the
affairs of my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have
been given only a little."'

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

i j h e y ask you about fighting in the Sacred Month.
Say: "Fighting therein is a heinous thing, but to hinder
men from the way o f Allah, and to be ungrateful to
Him, and to hinder men from the Sacred Masjid, and to
turn out its people there from , is more heinous to
A llah.'> (Al-Baqarah 2:217)
The reply: 4 S a y : "Fighting therein... "4 until the end is a
confirmation from Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
The universal Ayat are very obvious, there are so many
signs with which Allah supported His Messenger, whether
they came due to a cause or without one. And this is well
known in the Sirah.
Therefore, we understand from the word "Musaddaqun"
that they are given credence by Allah with universal and
legislative Ayat, and they are to be given credence from the
view of creation; that is, it is obligatory for them to trust
them. We only interpreted that to refer to trust legislatively
because there are those among the people who trust, and
there are those among them who do not trust, but what is
obligatory is to trust.
Concerning his statement: "unlike those who say about
Allah what they know not.”
These people are the liars or those who go astray, because
they say what they know not.
It appears the author, may Allah have mercy upon him, is
referring to the people of Tahnf, because the people of Tahrif
said about Allah what they know not, from ways. They said:
"H e did not intend that” and "H e intended this” !! They
spoke about negation and affirmation without knowledge.
For example; they said: "By face, He did not mean face in
reality.” Here, they spoke about Allah with what they did
not know through a form of negation. They then said: "The

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

183

meaning of the face is the reward;" So they spoke about
Allah what they know not through a form of affirmation.
These people who speak about Allah with what they do not
know can neither be truthful, nor entrusted, nor trusted.
Rather, the evidences establish that they are liars, belied
with what Shaitan inspired them.

‘Izzah is not a creation, because it is of His Attributes.

So we say; this is a form of attributing the noun described
to the description, and as such }L ord o f Al-'Izzah (Honor

'Izzah,” as it would be said: "the Lord of the house"

whatever He attributed to, and named H im self with

The Commentary
The author, may Allah have mercy upon him, explained in
this sentence that Allah combined between negation and
affirmation regarding whatever He attributed to, and
named Himself with, this is because the completeness of
perfection will not be achieved, except with the affirmation
of the attributes of perfection, and the negation of what
contradicts them among the attributes of imperfection. The
author, may Allah have mercy upon him, therefore
indicates to us that Attributes are of two types:
Affirmed Attributes: To them, they are called As-Sifat AthThabutiyyah (affirming Attributes).
Negated Attributes: They call them As-Sifat As-Salbiyyah,
from As-Salb and it means the negation. And there is no
problem calling it Salbiyyah (negated), even though some
people hesitated and said: "W e would not call them
Salbiyah, we would rather say Manfiyyah (negated)." We
reply to them that as long as Salb has the meaning of Nafi in
the Arabic Language, there is no harm in the difference in
the expression.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

187

So the Attributes of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, are
two: Thabiitiyyah and Salbiyyah; if you wish you can say,
Muthbatah and Manfiyyah. The meaning is the same.
The Muthbatah: All of what Allah affirms for Himself, and
all of them are perfect Attributes. There is no imperfection
in them in any way. And from their perfection is that it is
not possible that what He affirmed indicates Tamthil
(likening); because likening (Him) to the creation is a kind
of imperfection.
If we understand this principle, we may recognize the
deviation of the people of Tahrif, who claim that the
Muthbatah Attributes necessitate a form of likening, and
then, they started negating them, fleeing from Tamthil.
As an example; they said that if we affirm a Face for Allah,
it dictates that it would be like the faces in creation.
Therefore, interpreting its meaning to mean something else,
other than a face in reality, becomes obligatory.
We reply to them: Every Attribute that Allah affirms for
Himself, then it is a perfect Attribute. It is never possible
that there would be an imperfection in any of the Attributes
that Allah affirmed for Himself. However, if someone says:
Are the Attributes Tawqifiyyah the Names, or can they be
known through Ijtihad (independent judgment)? Meaning,
would it be correct for us to describe Allah, Glorious and
Exalted is He with something that He, has not described
Himself?
We would reply by saying that the A ttributes are
Tawqifiyyah according to the popular view of the scholars,
just as the Names are. Therefore, do not describe Allah,
except with what He has described Himself.
Hence we say that the attributes are divided into three
categories; an absolute perfect attribute; a restrictively

188

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

perfect attribute; and an absolutely imperfect attribute.
As for an absolutely perfect attribute, then it is affirmed for
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, such as that He is the One
who speaks, and the Doer of what He wills, and Al-Qadir
(the All-Powerful) and similar to that.
As for the restrictively perfect attribute; Allah should not be
described with this except conditionally; such as cunning,
deception, mockery and their like. These are perfect
attributes with a condition. If it is mentioned in opposition
to those who are doing that, it is perfection. But if it is
mentioned generally, it will not be correct to ascribe it to
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. It is on this basis that it is
not correct to generally describe Him as cunning, or
mocking, or deceiving; rather they should be restricted.
So we say that He is cunning against those who are
cunning; He mocks the hypocrites; He deceives the
hypocrites; He plots against the unbelievers. You should
restrict them, because they should not be used except
restrictively.
As for the absolutely imperfect attribute, Allah is not
described with it in any condition; such as the incapable
one, the betrayer, the blind and the deaf; because they are
attributes of absolute imperfection; and as such, Allah
should not be described with them. Look at the difference
between one who deceives and the betrayer. Allah, the
Exalted, says:

iT h e hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He also
deceives them$ (An-Nisa 4:142)
So He affirms that He deceives those who attempt to
deceive Him. While in the case of betrayal, He says:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

189

iA n d if they intend to deal treacherously with you, they
have indeed been treacherous to Allah before^ (Al-Anfal
8:71).
He did not say that He betrayed them, because betrayal is a
form of deception in a situation of trust; therefore, a
deception in a situation of trust is an imperfection; there is
never any praiseworthy element in it. Therefore, the
attributes of imperfection are generally negated from Allah.
The Attributes that are derived from the Names are perfect
in every circumstance; Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is
described with what they indicate. Hearing is a perfect
attribute which is indicated by His name, As-Sami (the AllHearer). So every attribute indicated by the Names are
perfect Attributes, which are affirmed absolutely for Allah.
We make this a separate category, because it does not
require much elaboration, while the others are divided into
three categories as mentioned earlier. So, Allah did not
name Himself Al-Mutakallim (the speaker) despite that
speech can be good or evil, and it can also be neither good
nor evil, so evil is not attributed to Allah. And nonsense,
like that, is not attributed to Allah, because it is foolishness,
while good is attributed to Him, that is why He did not
name Himself Al-Mutakallim (the speaker), because the
Names are as Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, described
them:
&H\ k> ¥
i^And to Allah alone belong all the most beautiful
Namesfy (Al-A'raf 7:180).
There is no form of imperfection in them, and as such a
noun of absolute preference was used for them.

190

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

If someone says: We have understood the Attributes and
their categories. But what is the way to affirm an Attribute
as long as we are saying that the Attributes are Tawqifiyyah?
We reply: There are various ways to affirm an Attribute:
The first way: The Names indicate them. Because every
Name includes an Attribute. That is why we earlier said
that every one of Allah's Names refers to the Self of Allah,
and the Attribute that is derivable from it.
The second way: That there is a text for the Attribute. Such
as the Face, the two Hands, the two Eyes and the like.
These are mentioned in texts by Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime. And for example; retribution - the Exalted said:
yg. a
iS u rely, Allah is M ighty, Lord o f retribution^ (Ibrahim
14:47)
But Al-Muntaqim (the one who exacts retribution) is not one
of Allah's Names, contrary to what is found in some books
where the Names of Allah are listed. This is because
retribution is not mentioned except as a description, or a
restrictive active subject, as in His saying:

4 We will, surely, exact retribution from the guilty>
(As-Sajdah 32:22)
The third way: To take it from the action. Such as AlMutakallim (speaker);^ we take it from:
^

(Translation note) Meaning, He may be described as
M utakalliman "a speaker" not that it is a Name (as
preceded), and this is so, based upon His statement in the

Ayah.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

191

}A n d to Musa Allah spoke directly} (An-Nisa 4:164)
These are the ways by which an Attribute can be affirmed.
Based on this, we say the Attributes are more general than
the Names, because each Name includes an Attribute,
whereas each Attribute does not include a Name.
As for the attributes that are negated from Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, they are many; but those that are
affirmed are more, because the Attributes that are affirmed
are all perfect Attributes. The more numerous and variant
they are; the more perfect the One described. The negated
attributes are few; that is why we discover that they are
usually mentioned in general, not specified by a particular
description. And whatever is specified by a particular
description, it is only due to a particular reason; such as
belying those who claim that He should be described with
the attribute which He has negated from Himself, or to
dispel the assumption about this description that He
negated.
So the first category is general; as in His, the Exalted,
statement:

iT h ere is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearing,
the All-Seeing} (Ash-Shura 42:11)
Meaning, in His knowledge, power, hearing, seeing, might
('Izzah), wisdom, mercy, and other than these among His
Attributes. So He did not specify them, He rather says:

ith ere is nothing like H im }

192

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

This is a general comprehensive negation, indicating
absolute perfection:

* there is nothing like Him ^
Indicating every form of perfection.
But when there is a detailed negation, you only find it for a
reason; like His saying:

4 No son did Allah begetfy (.Al-Mu’minun 23:91)
This is in refutation to the one who says that Allah has a
child. And His statement:

4He begets not, nor is He beg otten (A l-Ikh las 112:3)
And His statement:

$And, verily, We created the heavens and the earth,
and all that is between them, in six days, and no
weariness touched Us$ (Qdf 50:38)
Since it may be assumed by the mind that does not
consider Allah with His due, that if He created these great
heavens and earths within a period of six days, He would
be exhausted: He therefore says:

$and no weariness touched Usfy
Meaning, tiredness and fatigue. It therefore becomes clear
with this, that the negation is not issued regarding the

Commentary On The Introductory Notes.

193

Attributes of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, except in
general, or specifically, when there is a reason for that.
Because the negation of a description does not include
perfection, except when it implies what is affrimed. For this
reason, we say that the Salbiyyah attributes which Allah
negated from Himself, imply the affirmation of the
perfection of their opposites. So His saying:

$and no weariness touched Us f
implies perfect power and ability. And His statement:
4 \j 3 JilJ

' d jf

i^And your Lord does not wrong anyone$ (A l-K ahf
18:49)
implies perfect justice. And His statement:
lix- JjUio 'illC I
iA n d surely Allah is not heedless o f what you do$ (AlBaqarah 2:85)
implies perfect knowledge and cognizance, and so on.
Therefore, inevitably, a negated description must indicate
what is affirmed, and that affirmation is the perfection of
the opposite of what was negated. Otherwise, it (the
negation) would not be praiseworthy.
One does not find a mere negation among the attributes
negated from Allah, because a mere negation proves non
existence, and non existence is nothing; so it contains
neither praise nor commendation. And, because it may be
thought that if He is unfit to be described with that
attribute, it therefore becomes a form of condemnation, and
it could be due to incom petence, so it is neither

194

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

praiseworthy nor commendable.
The first example which indicates incapability, is found in a
poem, wherein the poet says:[1]
“A tribe never betrays a covenant Nor do they oppress people, even a mustard seed's degree."
The second example that points to incompetence is that you
say: "Our wall does not wrong anybody."
What is compulsory upon us regarding these Attributes
that Allah affirms for Himself, and those that He negated,
is that we say: We hear, we trust, and we believe.
This is regarding the Attributes, among them are those
affirmed and those negated. As for the Names, they are all
affirmative.
However, there are among these affirmed Names of Allah
some that indicate a meaning that is affirming, and others
that indicate a meaning that negating. This is the basis of
categorization between negating and affirming in the case
of the Names of Allah.
Examples of those that indicate meanings that affirm are
many. An example of those that indicate a meaning that is
negating is As-Saldm. The scholars say the meaning of AsSalam is the one free from all defects. Therefore, it indicates
a negation; meaning there is neither imperfection, nor
defect for Him. In the same way is Al-Qudus, it is very close
to the meaning of As-Saldm, because its meaning is He who
is distinguished from every imperfection and defect.
The expression of the author, may Allah have mercy upon
him, therefore is sound and correct. In the case of the

Names, he does not intend that there are negated Names,
because a negated name is not considered a Name of Allah,
but his objective is that what Allah's Names indicate can be
affirming, or negating.

Concerning his statement: "So there is no renunciation

The Commentary
❖

Concerning his statement: "So there is no renunciation
fo r the People o f Sunnah and the Jama'ah o f what those who
were sent, came w ith." Al-'Udul (renunciation) means
turning away and deviation. It is not possible that the
People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah renounce what

196

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

the Messengers came with.
The author, may Allah have mercy upon him, only made
this negation to clarify that due to the completeness of their
adherence, it is not possible that they deviate from what the
Messengers came with. They are those who adhere
completely, without deviations at all from what the
Messengers came with. Rather, their path is that they say:
"W e hear and obey the rulings, and we hear and we trust
the information.”
❖

Concerning his statement: " of what those who were sent,
came w ith;" it is clear that we do not disregard what
Muhammad
came with, because he is the Last of the
Prophets; and it is obligatory for all the servants to
follow him. However, in the case of what came from
other than him, is it allowed for the People of the
Sunnah and the Jamd'ah to turn away from that? They
are not to turn away from that either, because there is
no contradiction in the information that came from the
Messengers, may the Salah and Salam be upon them,
because they are all trustworthy. It is not possible that
it was abrogated, because it is information (revealed).
Everything that the Messengers informed of about
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is to be accepted, and is
true, and it is obligatory to have faith in it.

For example: Musa, peace be upon him, said to Fir'awn
when he (Fir'awn) told him:

^"Wliat about the generations o f old?" He said: "The
knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a Record. My
Lord neither errs nor fo r g e t s ' ( T d Ha: 20: 51,52).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

197

He negated ignorance and forgetfulness from Allah, so it is
obligatory for us to believe that, because it came from a
Messenger, from Allah.

4He said: “Who then, O M usa, is the Lord o f you
two?” Musa said: "Our Lord is He Who gave to each
thing its form and nature, then guided it a r i g h t . (Ta
Ha 20:49,50).
If someone asks us: "H ow do we know that Allah gave to
each thing its form and nature?" We reply: "Based on the
statement of M usa," so we believe in that, and we say that
He gave each thing its form and nature which befits it. Man
is like this, the camel is like this, the cow is like this, the
sheep is like this. Then He guided each created thing to
what is useful for it and benefits it. Everything knows what
is useful and beneficial for it.
The ant stores its food in its hole during the summer. But it
will not store the grain as it is; it will cut off its top so that it
will not germinate, because if it germinates, it will be of no
use to him. During the rains, when the grain that is put in
the hole becomes wet, it will not leave it alone there to be
affected by the rotten odor, it will rather remove it from its
hole until it dries up in the sun and the wind, then it will
bring it inside!
However, it is required to clarify that whatever is ascribed
to the earlier Prophets, it needs to be authentically
reported, because of the possibility that it is a lie, just like
that which is ascribed to the Messenger of Allah
and
even more so.
And his statement: " of what those who were sent, came w ith”
- does this include the rulings or is it that the discussion

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wdsitiyyah

198

now has to do with the topic of the Attributes only, and
hence, is it only specific to the information?
If we consider the generality of the expression, we would
conclude that it includes both the information and the
judgments. But if we consider the context, we would say
that the context implies that the discussion concerns
matters of creed, and it is from the topic of information.
However, we say that if the statement of Shaikh Al-lslam,
may Allah have mercy upon him, has to do with creed
specifically, then that is specific, and we do not have
anything to say; but if it is general, it therefore includes the
matters of rulings.
And the scholars differ concerning the rulings that are from
the earlier Messengers. Are they rulings for us if our
Shan ah does not come with anything contradictory to
them, or are they not rulings for us?*1'
What is correct is that they are rulings for us, and that
whatever rulings are affirmed from the earlier Prophets,
then it is for us, except when our Shark ah comes with
something contradictory. If our Shark ah comes with any­
thing contradictory to it, it will be in accordance with that.
For example, prostration as a way of greeting was allowed
in the Shark ah of Yusuf, Ya'qub and his sons, but it is
unlawful in our Shark ah. In the same way, camels were
unlawful for the Jews:

There are two narrations from Ahmad. The first; that they
are also rulings for us, and the second; that they are not
rulings for us. Ibn Qudamah mentioned both in RawdatunNazir (2:517).

(animal) with undivided hoofo (Al-An'dm :146)
But they are lawful in our Shan ah.
Therefore, it is possible that we interpret the statement of
Shaikh Al-lslam, may Allah have mercy upon him, to
include information and rulings. And that we say that
whatever rulings were among the Shan'ahs of earlier
Prophets, then it is for us, except if there is an evidence
(to the contrary).
But there remains a problem; how do we know that this is
from the Shan ah of the earlier Prophets?
We say; there are two ways for us regarding that: the first
way: through the Book (the Qur'an). The second way is
through the Sunnah.
Whatever Allah relates regarding the earlier nations, then it
is affirmed, and whatever the Prophet
related (about
them) - in what is authentically related from him - then it is
also affirmed.
As for what remains, we neither attest to it, nor belie it,
except if our Shan ah comes with what testifies to what is
reported from the People of the Book; for we will believe it
not because of their reports, but because of what is
contained in our Shan ah. If our Sharfah comes with what
belies the People of the Book, we will belie it, because our
Shan'ah has belied it. The Christians claim that the Al-Masdi
(the Messiah) was the son of Allah. We say: "This is a lie!”
The Jews say that 'Uzair was the son of Allah. We say:
"This is a lie.”
❖

Concerning his statement, may Allah have mercy
upon him: "For indeed, it is As-Sirdt Al-Mustaqim" Fa
innahu (For indeed it is) is a pronoun that is referring to
what the Messengers came with; and it is possible that
it refers to the way of the People of the Sunnah and the

200

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Jama ah; and that is following, and not turning away
from it. So what the Messengers came with, and what
the People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah go to, it is AsSirat Al-Mustaqim.
S irat is in the Fa'al form, with the meaning of Masriit. Like
Fardsh (bed) has the meaning of Mafrush, and Ghards
(planting) has the meaning of Maghrus. So its meaning is
that of the M a f ul noun. And As-Sirat is only said for a
wide, straight path, and it is derived from the term AzZarat which means to swallow the morsel quickly; because
when the path is wide, there will be no restriction blocking
the people in it. Therefore, in defining As-Sirat, they say:
Every wide path, without slopes nor declines nor bends.
Therefore, the path that the Messengers came with is AsSirat Al-Mustaqim, the one that has no bends nor crooked­
ness; a straight path without any deviation to the right or to
the left.

iT h is is My straight path. So follow ify (Al-An'am
8:153)
Based on this, Al-Mustaqim is therefore further descriptive
of our explanation of As-Sirat; that it is the wide path which
has no bends in it, because this is Al-Mustaqim. Or it is said
it is a restrictive description, because some paths might not
be straight, as Allah, the Exalted, says:

4 And lead them on to the path o f the flam ing Fire. But
stop them, vereily, they are to he questioned^ (As-Sajfat
37:23 and 24).
And this path is not straight.

201

Concerning his statement: "the Sirat o f those whom
Allah favored, among the Prophets, As-Siddiqin, AshS hu hada, and the righteous."

"The Sirat o f those whom Allah favored" that is their path. He
attributed it to them because they traversed upon it; they
are the ones walking upon it, as Allah sometimes attributes
it to Himself:
(j l» a1

O

4And verily, you are indeed guiding to a Siratin
M ustaqim . Allah's Sirat, to Whom belongs all that is in
the heavens and all that is in the earth.$ (Ash-Shura
42:52,53)
Insomuch as it is He Who legislated it and established it for
His servants, and that it leads to Him, so it is the Sirat of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, from two angles, and the
believers' Sirat from one angle. It is Allah's Sirat from the
two angles that it is He who established it for His servants,
and, that it leads to Him. And it is the believers' Sirat
because it is they alone who traverse upon it.
❖

Concerning his statement: "the Sirat o f those whom
Allah favored"

An-Ni'mah (favor): Every virtue and beneficence from
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, upon His servants, it is a
Ni'mah (favor). And every favor that we have is from Allah.
And the favors of Allah are of two categories: General and
specific. And specific also has two categories: The
particularly specific, and the generally specific.
The general refers to that which is for the believers and
other than the believers. For this reason, if somebody asks

202

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

us: "Does Allah grant favors to the disbeliever?” We say:
Yes, but these are general favors. They are favors that
maintain their bodies; not those that benefit their religion.
For example food, drink, clothing, abode, and the like. Both
the believer and the disbeliever are included in these.
As for the specific favor, it is what benefits their religion,
like faith, knowledge, and righteous actions; these are
specific for the believers, and they are general for the
Prophets, and the Siddiqin, just like the martyrs and the
righteous. But Allah's favors upon the Prophets and the
Messengers are of the most specific kind. Listen to His, the
Exalted, statement:

4And Allah has sent down to you the Book and AlHikmah (the wisdom), and taught you that which you
knew not. And tremendous is Allah's grace upon you4
(.An-Nisd' 4:113)
So this is a favor which is more specific, the believers do not
share in it with the Prophets, rather they are excluded from
it.
❖

Concerning his statement: "the Sirdt o f those whom
Allah favored" - it is like His, the Exalted, statement:

*G uide us in As-Sirdt Al-Mustaqim. The Sirat o f those
upon whom You have bestowed your fav ors.4 (AlFdtihah 1 :6,7).
So who are those upon whom Allah has bestowed His
favors? Allah, the Exalted, explains it with His saying:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

203

4And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger, then
they will be in the company o f those upon whom Allah
has bestowed his favor, o f the Prophets, the Siddiqin,
Ash-Shuhada , and the righteous^ (An-Nisa 4:69)
These are four categories.
Firstly: The Prophets, they are all of those upon whom Allah
sent revelation and conferred Propethood, and this is
included in this Ayah. It also includes the Messengers, because
every Messenger is a Prophet, but not every Prophet is a
Messenger. Based on this, the Prophets will therefore, include
the Messengers; so the Prophets includes the Messengers of
firm resolve (Uwlil-'Azm) and the others, and it also includes
the Prophets who were not sent (as Messengers), and these are
the most exalted category of the creation.
Secondly: As-Siddiqun, which is plural of Siddiq. So, who
are they? The best explanation of As-Siddiq, is His, the
Exalted, saying:

4And he who brought the truth (As-Sidq), and believed
(Saddaqa) in ify (Az-Zumar 39:33)
And His, the Exalted, saying:

4And those who believe in Allah and His Messengers,
they are As-Siddiqun^ (Al-Hadid 57:19)
Whoever fulfills faith - and none fulfills faith except with AsSidq (truthfulness) and At-Tasdiq (trust); then he is a Siddiq.

204

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

As-Sidq in creed means with Ikhlas (sincerity), and this is the
most difficult thing for a man, such that one of the Salaf
(pious predecessors) said: "I do not endure a more severe
struggle with my soul over anything like I do over Al-Ikhlds
(sincerity)." Therefore, one must have As-Sidq in the
objective - and that is the creed - and Al-Ikhlds (sincerity)
for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
As-Sidq in speech, is that one does not say except what is in
accord with the reality; whether that is against himself, or
others. So he maintains justice with himself, and with
others, his father, his mother, his brother, and his sister,
and others.
As-Sidq in actions means that one's deeds are in accordance
with what the Prophet ^ came with. And part of Sidq in
actions is that they spring from Ikhlas (sincerity). If they do
not spring from IkJilas; he is not behaving with Sidq,
because his deeds contradict his saying. Therefore, the
Siddiq is he who is truthful in his creed, his Ikhlas, his intent,
his speech, and his actions.
As a general term, the most virtuous of As-Siddiqin is Abu
Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him. This is because the
most virtuous of all Ummahs (nations) is this Ummah
(nation), and the most virtuous of this Ummah after its
Prophet is Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him.
And being a Siddiq is a status for men and women.
Regarding 'Isa, the son of Maryam, Allah, the Exalted, said:

iA n d his mother was a Siddlqahty (Al-Ma'idah 5:75)
It is said: As-Siddiqah the daughter of As-Siddlq about
'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, and Allah, the
Exalted, favors whom He wills among His servants.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

205

As for A sh-Shuhada, it is said that they are those who were
killed in the Cause of Allah, based on His statement:

4And that Allah distinguishes those who believe and
may take Shuhadd' (martyrs) from among you$ (Al
'Imran 3:140)
It is also said that they are the scholars based on His
statement:
i J J \ \jj\j I s C O j

\

V p

$Allah bears witness (Shahid Allah) that there is no god
but He - as do the Angels, and those possessing
k n o w le d g e (Al 'Imran 3:18).
He, therefore made the people of knowledge witnesses to
what Allah testifies to Himself, and because the scholars
testify to the Messengers' by proclamation, and to the
Ummah by conveying (the Message).
If it were said that the Ayah is general, for whoever was
killed in the Cause of Allah, the Exalted, as well as the
scholars, because the expression is applicable to both, and
they are not contradictory; then it therefore includes those
who were killed in the Cause of Allah, and the scholars
who testify to Allah's Oneness, and testify for the Prophet
by conveying (the Message) and to the Ummah whom it
is conveyed (then this would be correct).
As for the righteous people, it includes all three categories
that preceded, and those who are below them in rank. So
the Prophets are righteous, As-Siddfqun are righteous, and
the Shuhada' are righteous. They are listed via the method
of listing the general along with the specific. The righteous
are those that fulfill the rights of Allah and the rights of His

206

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

servants, but they do not hold the previously mentioned
status' — the status of Prophethood, Siddiqiyyah and AshShahadah (martyrdom witnessing) — they are below them
in rank.
This Sirat which the Messengers came with is the Sirat of
these four categories of people, so others do not walk upon
that which the Messengers brought.

The Commentary
❖

Concerning his statement: "Included in this topic," it is
implied that by this, he means his own sayin g: "And He
combined between negation and affirmation regarding
whatever He attributed to, and named H im self w ith." It
is also possible that he is referring to what preceded,
regarding the fact that the People of the Sunnah and the
Jama'ah describe Allah, the Exalted, with what He
describes Himself, and what His Messenger described
Him with.

In either case, this Surah, together with what comes after it,
is included in what was earlier discussed, regarding the
fact that Allah, the Exalted, combined between negation
and affirmation regarding what He attributed to, and
named Himself with, and the People of the Sunnah believe
in that.
❖

Concerning his statement: "In Surat Al-Ikhlds" AsSurah is an expression used to indicate Ayat from
Allah's Book that are Musawwarah (enclosed); that is,
separated from what precedes them and what comes
after them, like a building that is surrounded by a
fence.

❖

Concerning his statement: "Surat Al-Ikhlas" Having
Ikhlas with something, means "cleaning". That is that
which is cleaned and nothing remains mixed with it. It
is said that it is named that because it contains Ikhlas for
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and that whoever
believes in it, then he is a Mukhlis. It therefore means
that it is Mukhlisah (purifying) for one who recites it.
That is, that when the person recites it, believing in it,

208

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

then he has done Ikhlas for Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime.
It is also said that it is Mukhlasah - with Fath on the Lam;
because Allah, the Exalted purified it for Himself, not
mentioning in it any rulings, nor any matters of informa­
tion about other than Him. Rather, it is information
specifically about Allah. And both of these meanings are
correct, and there is no contradiction between the two of
them.
❖

Concerning his statement: "which is equal to a third o f
the Qur'an," the evidence for that, is the saying of the
Prophet ^ to his Com panions: “Would anyone of you
be able to recite one-third of the Qur'an in a night?"
They asked : "H ow is that, O Messenger of Allah?" He
sa id : "(Allah is O ne; Allah is As-Samad) is equal to one
third of the Q ur'an." ^

So this Surah is equal to a third of the Qur'an, in reward,
not proportion. This is as has been affirmed from the
Prophet #1, that: "W hoever says: 'There is none worthy of
worship except Allah Alone, without partners, His is the
Dominion, and to Him is the praise, and He has power
over all things' - ten times, it is as if he freed four people
from among the children of Ism a'il." [2]
So, if one says this statement of remembrance ten times,
and it was required upon him to free four slaves, does that
suffice him? We say that this does not suffice him, while the
reward is equal to that as the Prophet ^ said. An equality
111 Reported by Al-Bukhari (5015) from Abu Sa'id Al-KhudrI,
may Allah be pleased with him, and Muslim (811) from Abu
Darda'

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

209

in terms of reward does not necessitate equality in terms of
fulfillment. For this reason, if somebody recites Surat AlIkhlds three times during the Salah, it will not suffice him for
the recitation of Al-Fatihah.
The scholars say that the meaning of it being equal to a
third of the Qur'an is that the Qur'an contains sections
regarding information about Allah, information about
creation, and rulings. These are three.
1. Information about Allah: They say that Surah $ S a y :
"He is Allah, One"$ comprises that.
2. Information about creation; such as the information of
the earlier nations, and information concerning con­
temporary events, and future events.
3. The third is about rulings, such as “Establish (Salah),"
"Give (Zakah:)," "D o not commit Shirk" and the like.
This is the best of what is said about it being equal to a
third of the Qur'an.

Huwa is a pronoun. What does it refer to? It is said
that it refers to the one who is asked about. As if he
is saying: "The one whom you are asking about is
Allah." It is said that it is the pronoun serving as the
main subject, and "A llah" is the second subject, and
"O ne" is the predicate of the second subject. Based
on the first consideration, "H e" is a subject, "A llah"
is the predicate of the subject and (the) "O ne" is the
second predicate.

"A llah" is the proper noun that refers to Allah Himself; it is
unique to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. None other than
Him is named with it. Every other Name of Allah follows it
except in a few cases.
The meaning of "A llah" is Al-Ilah (the Deity), that is "the
one who is deified" meaning, worshipped, but the Hamzah
became silent due to constant usage, just as in the case of
An-Nas, (the people) its basis is Al-Unas, and in the case of:
"Hadha khairu min hadha (This is better than this) its basis is
actually: "Hadha akhairu min hadha, but due to extensive

Then, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime is Ahad (One). Ahad
usually is not used except in the case of a negation, or in
affirmation in the case of days of the week. It is said: "AlAhad (Sunday), Al-Ithnain (Monday)../' but it comes with
respect to affirmation to describe the Lord, the Mighty and
Sublime, because He, Glorious and Exalted is He, is One.
That is He is One in matters that are specific to Him, in His
Self, His Names, His Attributes and His actions. 4 O ne}: He

Concerning his statement: " 4 Allah is A s-S am ad y

This is a clause of continuation, after He mentioned AlAhadaniyyah (the oneness), he mentioned As-Samadiyyah,
and used a definite clause for both, to indicate exclusivity.
That is Allah, alone, is As-Samad.
What is the meaning of As-Samad?
It is said that As-Samad means He is the Perfect One, in His
Knowledge, His Power, His Wisdom, His 'Izzah (Honor
and Might), His Sovereignty and in all His Attributes. It is
also said: As-Samad is the one who does not have any cavity
- that is without intestines nor abdomen. That is why it is
said: The Angels are Samad because they do not have
cavities; they do not eat nor drink. This meaning is related
from Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.[1] And
this does not negate the first meaning, because it indicates
His self sufficiency from all of His creation.
And it is said: As-Samad has the meaning of the Ma'ful

Reported by Ibn Abl 'Asim in As-Sunnah (665) with a weak
chain of transmission from Ibn Abbas. It is authentically
transmitted from Mujahid; " As-Samad: the one without an
abdomen as is in As-Sunnah of Ibn Abl 'Asim (673) and Ibn
Kathlr authenticated its report from the Companion
'Abdullah bin Buraidah.

form, that is Al-Masmudu ilaihi; He who is betaken to by the
creation for their needs, with the meaning that they incline
to Him, and they reach out for Him, and surrender their
needs to Him. So it has the meaning of the One whom
everyone is in need of.
These interpretations do not contradict one another in
relation to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and as such we
say that each of these meanings are affirmed due to the lack
of contradiction among them. We interpret it with a
comprehensive interpretation; we say As-Samad is the
One Who is Perfect in His Attributes, the One whom all
His creatures are in need of; they are dependent upon Him.
Therefore, the tremendous meaning of the word As-Samad
becomes clear to you. He is the One independent of any
need from all other than Him, Perfect in all of what is
attributed to Him, and that all other than Him is in need of
Him.
If somebody says to you: "Allah rose above the Throne,
does His rising above the Throne mean that He is in need of
the Throne, such that if the Throne was removed, He
would fall?” The answer is no! Never! Because Allah is
Samad, perfect without need of the Throne. Rather the
Throne, the heavens, the K u rsiand all creatures are in need
of Allah; He is independent of any need from them. We
derive this from the word As-Samad.
If somebody asks: "Does Allah eat and drink?" I say:
"Never; because Allah is Samad."
With this, we recognize that the word As-Samad is a word
that covers all the perfect Attributes of Allah, and it relates
to all the imperfect attributes of the creatures. That is why
they are in need of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.

Samadiyyah and Al-Ahadaniyyah We say it is an
emphasis, because we have understood this from
what preceded; therefore, its mention will serve as an
emphasis to what has preceded, and a form of
acknowledging it.
So because of His Ahadaniyyah and His Samadiyyah, He
does not beget; because the child is like the father in its
nature, attributes, and even in resemblance. When Mujaziz
Al-Mudlaji went to Zaid bin Harithah and his son Usamah,
while both of them were covered up with a Rida', and their
feet were uncovered, he looked at the feet and said: "These
feet are from each o t h e r . H e knew that because of the
resemblance.
So because of His perfect Ahadaniyyah and His perfect
Samadiyyah; 4He begets notf. And the father is in need of
the son, to serve him, spend on him, and support him
when he is incapable, and he makes his lineage live on.
4Nor was He begotten^ because if He was begotten, He
would have been preceded by a father, while He, the
Mighty and Sublime, is the First, nothing was before
Him; He is the Creator, and everything other than Him
is a creature, how would He be begotten?
And rejecting him being begotten is more comprehensive
to the intellect than rejecting that he begot. That is why no
one claims that Allah was begotten, while the fabricators
claim that He had a son. Allah has negated both of these,
and He began with the negation of having a son because of
the importance attached to rebutting those who claim so.
He rather says:

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

$Alldh has not taken unto Him self any son. 4 (Al Mu'minun 23:91)
- even in the designation, so He does not beget, nor does He
take a son. The children of Adam could take someone
among them to be their child, someone he neither adopts
nor acquires by Wildyah or other than that, even though
adoption is not legislated. But as for Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, He begets not nor was He begotten. And since it is
possible that it occurs to the mind that something that is
neither a father nor begotten one, yet it is produced, He
negated this wrong assumption which may occur, and said:
iA n d there is none like unto Him4 And when it is negated
that any are like Him, it therefore suggests that He is not
produced. $And there is none like unto Him$; That is, none
is His likeness, in any of His Attributes.
There are affirming Attributes and negating Attributes in
this Surah.
The affirming Attributes: iA lld h 4 which includes AlUluhiyyah (divinity); iOnefy which includes Al-Ahadiyyah,
and 4As-Samad^ which includes As-Samadiyyah.
The negating Attributes are: 4He begets not nor was He
begotten4 and 4 There is none like unto Him.ty
There are three affirming, and three negating, and this
negation contains affirmations of perfection in Al-Ahadiyyah and As-Samadiyyah.

The Commentary
♦♦♦ Concerning his statement: "And what He described
Himself with in the most magnificent Ayah in Allah's
Book, "this Ayah is called Ayatul-Kursf, because the
mention of the Kursi is made therein:

4 His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earthy
And it is the greatest verse in the Book of Allah. And the
evidence for that is that the Prophet sS asked Ubayy bin
Ka'b: "W hich Ayah in the Book of Allah is the most
magnificent?" He said to him:

4,Allah, there is no Ilah except Himfy
He
patted his chest, and said: "The knowledge has been
made easy for you, O Abu Al-Mundhir."*1* That is, the
Prophet
affirmed that it is the most magnificent Ayah in
the Book of Allah, and this is evidence of Ubayy's
knowledge of the Book of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
There is evidence in this Hadith that parts of the Qur'an are
superior to others, as was indicated by the Hadith about
Surat Al-Ikhlds. And this is a subject that requires explana­
tion. So we say, in reference to the Speaker, then there is no
distinction of superiority, because the Speaker (in all of it) is
One, and He is Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. But in
111

Reported by Muslim (810) from Ubayy bin Ka'b 4®.

reference to content and subjects, then there is a superiority
distinction. So Surat Al-Ikhlds — containing the praise of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and what it includes
regarding the Names and Attributes, — is not like Surat AlMasad — as far as the subjects are concerned — which
contains a clarification of the case of Abu Lahb.
In the same manner, there are distinctions in relation to the
effect and strength in the manner of expression; because
you will find some Ayat that are brief, while containing a
strong deterrence and admonition for the heart, and you
find another Ayah that is lengthier than it, but it does not
comprise what the first one comprised. For example, His,
the Exalted, saying:

* 4 2 hi \ p : p j \ ( ik p

4 0 you who believe! When you contract a debt fo r a
fixed period, then write it down^ (Al-Baqarah 2:282)
The subject of this verse is simple; it deals with the matter
of inter-relationship among people. It does not contain such
effect as that which is contained in this statement of Allah the Mighty and Sublime -

So this contains tremendous meanings; restraint, admoni­

tion, arousal of hope and the instilment fear. It is, for
example, not like the Ayah regarding debt, while the Ayah
regarding debt is longer than it.
❖

Concerning the author's statement: "And what He
described H im self with in the most magnificent Ayah in
Allah's Book, when He said: 4 Allah, there is no Ilah
except H i m ,y Allah informs in this Ayah that He is
the sole possessor of Uluhiyyah (divinity), and that is
derived from His saying:

iA llah , there is Ilah except Him
Because this clause implies a restriction. The style of stating
an affirmation after a negation, is among the strongest
manners to express a restriction.
❖

Concerning his statement: “ $Al-Hayyu Al-Qayyiimfy;"
Al-Hayyu; possessing perfect life, which covers all of
the perfect Attributes; not preceded by non-existence,
nor suffering extinction; and no imperfection in any
form will befall it.

And $Al-Hayyuty: is among the Names of Allah, while it
is used for other than Allah. Allah. The Exalted, said:

4He brings forth the living (Al-Hayy) from the deadfy
(Al-An'am 6:95)
But the Living is not like the living, and a share in the name
does not necessitate a commonality in what is named.
i^Al-Qayyumy. is in the Fay'ul form, and this is a method
of exaggeration in the expression, and it is derived from
Al-Qiydm (to maintain).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

219

And the meaning of $Al-Qayyumfy is that He maintains
Himself, so His maintaining Himself necessitates that He
is independent from everything, having no need to eat
nor drink, nor other than that, and, that other than Him
does not maintain itself. Rather, it is in need of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, for its coming into existence, its
growth and provision.
And among the meanings of 4Al-Qayyum4 is that He
maintains the others. This is based upon the saying of
the Exalted:
I

41s then He, Who maintains every soul with what it
earns. . . 4 (Ar-Ra'd 13:33)
The opposite is omitted; it is: "A s the one who is not like
that." He Who maintains every soul with what it earns is
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. That is why the scholars
say: 4Al-Qayyum4 is He Who maintains Himself in
maintaining other than Him. And when it is He Who
maintains the others, it necessitates that the others are
maintained by Him. Allah, the Exalted, said:

4And among His Ayat is that the heavens and the earth
are maintained by His command4 {Ar-Rum 30:25).
Therefore, His are the perfect Attributes, the perfect
Sovereignty, and actions.
These two Names (Al-Hayyu, Al-Qayyum) are two magni­
ficent Names, with which, if one calls upon Allah, He
responds. That is why, it is necessary for a person to
intercede with Allah using these Names in his supplica­
tions, saying: "4Ya Hayyu! Ya Qayyum4 (O Ever-Living, O

They are mentioned in three locations of the Mighty Book.
This is one of them. The second is in Surah Al ‘Imran:
C
$Allah, there is no Ilah except Him, Al-Hayyu, AlQayyumfy (Al 'Imran 3:2)
And the third is in Surah Ta Ha:

$And faces shall be humbled before Al-Hayyu, AlQayyum, and he will be a failure, who carried wrong
doingfy (Ta Ha :111)
These two Names contain self perfection and perfection of
sovereignty. The self perfection is in His word 4 Al-Hayyu4
and the sovereignty is in His word $Al-Qayyum)» because
He maintains everything, and everything is maintained
by Him.
❖

Concerning his statement: 4 neither sleep, nor slumber
overtake Him$ As-Sinah (slumber) is drowsiness, it
precedes sleep. He did not say: "H e sleeps not”
because sleep may be by choice, but to be overtaken
is by coercion.

Sleep is a form of imperfection. The Prophet
[11

said: "Allah

Based upon what was reported and graded Sahih by AlHakim (1:509), from Ibn Mas'ud, and, Ibn As-SunnI in ‘Amal
Al-Yawm uml-Lailah (337) from Anas bin Malik, he said:
"W hen Allah's Messenger jfe was concerned about a matter,
he would say: 'Yd Hayyu, Yd Qayyum, bi-rahtnatik astaghith

At-Tirmidhi reported similar (3436).

does not sleep and it does not befit Him to sleep.”
This
attribute is one of negation, and it has been said earlier that
the attributes of negation will always contain an affirma­
tion, which is the perfection of the opposite. The perfection
that is contained in His statement 4 neither sleep, nor
slumber overtake Him$ is the perfection of life and
maintenance. It is from the perfection of His Living that
He does not have a need for sleep, and from the
perfection of His maintenance that He does not sleep,
because sleep is only needed by the living due to its
imperfectness; because it needs to sleep in order to rest
from the preceding fatigue and to regain strength for
future work. And for this reason the inhabitants of
Paradise have a perfect life, in that they do not sleep, as
is authentically narrated.
But if someone says that sleep is a form of perfection with
respect to man, and as such if he cannot sleep, he will be
deemed unwell. We reply that it is as eating is a form of
perfection with respect to man. If he cannot eat, he is
considered sick. However, it is a form of perfection in one
way, and a form of imperfection in another way. It is a form
of perfection because it indicates his physical well-being and
soundness, and it is a form of imperfection because the body
needs it. So in reality it is a form of imperfection.
Therefore, not every kind of perfection relative to creation
is a kind of perfection for the Creator, just as whatever is
perfect with regard to the Creator is not perfect with regard
to the creation. So pride is a form of perfection for the
Creator and a defect in creation. Eating, drinking and sleep
are forms of perfection in the creatures and a form of
imperfection in the case of the Creator. That is why Allah,
[11

Reported by Muslim (179) from the Hadith of Abu Musa Al' Ash'an

the Exalted, says regarding Himself:

❖

Concerning His statement: 4For Him is what is in the
heavens and in the earthy, iw h at is in the heavens
meaning the Angels, Paradise and other than that
about which we know not.

$And in the earthy all creatures; animals and other than
animals.
❖

Concerning His statement: i_the heavens^ it implies
that the heavens are numerous, and this is the case.
There is proof in the Qur'an that they are seven:

4 S ay : "Who is the Lord o f the seven heavens, and the Lord

The Qur'an indicates that the earths are seven, without it
being clearly stated, but it is clearly stated in the Sunnah.
Allah, the Exalted, says:

iA llah is He who created the seven heavens, and o f the
earth, the like th ereof(A t-T a laq 65:12)
The like thereof, in terms of number, not in terms of
description.
And in the Sunnah, the Prophet ^ said: "W hoever acquires
a span of land unjustly, Allah will encircle it to his neck on
the Day of Judgment from the seven earth s."^

Concerning His statement:
$W ho is it that can
intercede before Him except with His permission4

4W ho is itfy is an interrogative pronoun, or we say $ w h of
is an interrogative pronoun. It is not correct to say that
4Dhd4 is a relative pronoun in this kind of construction,
because the meaning of the sentence would be: "W ho is
the one, the one?" and this is not correct.
❖

Concerning His statement:
4Who is it that can
intercede before Him except with His permission?4 AshShafd'ah linguistically means making an odd thing,
even. Allah, the Exalted, says:

4 And the even and the od d .4 (Al-Fajr 89:3)
As a technical term, it is the act of interceding for another
person in order to bring him benefit or save him from harm.
For example, the intercession of the Prophet ^ for the people
at the place of standing (on the Day of Resurrection) so that
Allah will begin judging them; this is an intercession to save
from a harm, while his intercession for the people of Paradise
to enter it is one of bringing benefit.
❖

Concerning His statement: $W ith Him4 - that is with
Allah.

❖

4Fxcept with His permission4 that is, His permission
for it. This implies an affirmation of intercession, but
with the condition of His permission. The basis for
that is that if it were not affirmed, the exception in
His saying 4Except with His permission4 would be
futile, without any benefit.

And He mentioned this after His statement: 4Eor Him is
what is in the h eav en s...4 which implies that sovereignty
that is uniquely Allah's, the Migthy and Sublime, is a

224

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

sovereignty of complete authority, with the meaning that
there is no one who is capable to make any exchange,
nor intercession which is itself good, except with Allah's
permission, and this is from the completeness of His, the
Mighty and Sublime, Rububiyyah (Lordship) and author­
ity. This clause shows that for Allah is an Idhn (permis­
sion).
And Idhn in its basis means Al-Ylam (proclamation); Allah,
the Exalted, said:

4And an Adhan (proclamation) from Allah and His
Messenger4 (At-Tawbah 9:3)
That is, an I'lam (pronouncement) from Allah and His
Messenger; so bi idhnihi means: His pronouncement that He
is pleased with that.
There are other conditions for intercession. Among them,
that Allah is pleased with both the intercessor and the one
interceded for. Allah, the Exalted, says:

4And they intercede not except fo r him whom He is
p leased (A l-A n b iy a’ 21:28)
And He says:

4 0 n that Day, intercession shall not benefit except
whom Ar-Rahman permits fo r him, and whose saying
He is pleased with)* (Td Ha 20:109)
And there is an Ayah that arranges these three conditions:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

225

4 And how many Angels are there in the heavens, whose
intercession shall be o f no avail, except after Allah gives
permission to whomsoever He wills and is pleased4 (AnNajm 53:26)
That is, being pleased with both the intercessor and the one
being interceded for.
If someone asks; what is the benefit of intercession when
Allah knows that the one interceded for shall be saved? The
response is that Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, gives
permission of intercession to the one who intercedes to
honor him, and for him to attain the praiseworthy status.
❖

Concerning His statement: 4,He knows what is in front
o f them and what is behind them4 Knowledge is to
absolutely comprehend something as it is, and Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime: ikn ow s what is in front o f
them^ - the future - 4 and what is behind4 the past.
And the word Ma (what) is general, including every
past and future event. It also includes His actions
and the actions of His creation.

❖

Concerning His statement: 4and they will not
encompass anything o f His knowledge, except what He
willsfy The pronoun 4they encompass4 refers to the
creation, which is indicated by His saying: 4.For Him
is what is in the heavens and what is on the earthy

Meaning that none in the heavens and on the earth can
encompass any of Allah's knowledge, except that which He
wills.
❖

His statement: 4 o f His knowledge4 can refer to the
knowledge of Him and His Attributes. That is, we do
not know anything about Allah, His Self, and

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Attributes, except as He makes us know about Him.
And knowledge here may be referring to what is
known, meaning; they do not encompass anything of
what is known to Him, except what He wills. Both
meanings are correct. And we could say that the
second is more general, because the knowledge of
His Self and His Attributes, and other that, all fall
under what is known to Him.
❖

His statement: iE x cep t what He wills$ meaning;
except that which He wills concerning that which He
taught them about Himself. And Allah, the Exalted,
has taught us many things about His Names, His
Attributes, His universal rulings, and His legislative
rulings. However, these many things (that we know)
are few compared to what is known to Him, as
Allah, the Exalted, says:

^And they ask you concerning the Ruh (Spirit). Say:

Concerning His statement: ^Hzs Kursi extends over the
heavens and the earthy. ^extends^ meaning encloses,
that is, His Kursi surrounds the heavens and the
earth, and is greater than them, because if it is not
greater, it would not extend about them. The Kursi is,

Kursi. It has been reported from the Prophet #1 that:
"The seven heavens and the seven earths compared
to the Kursi, are like a ring thrown in a desert, and
the superiority of the Throne over the Kursi is like
the superiority of that desert over this rin g ."^
This indicates the magnificence of these creations; and the
magnificence of the creation indicates the magnificence of
the Creator.

and the earth does not pose any burden to Him, and
it is not taxing for Him.

This is among the negating Attributes. The affirming

ability, knowledge, power, and mercy.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

'Aliyy is in the F ail form, and it is an adjective,
because His, the Mighty and Sublime, exaltedness is
inevitably with His Self. The difference between an
adjective and an active participle, is that the active
participle is temporal, its disappearance is possible,
while the adjective is always accom panying the
described, and it does not separate from it.
And the 'Ulii (exaltedness) of Allah is of two types: The
'Ulii of the Self and the 'Ulu of the Attributes.
As for the 'Ulii of the Self, it means He is above everything
in Himself. There is nothing above or beside Him.
As for the 'Ulii of the Attributes, it is what is being referred
to by this verse:

4And fo r Allah are all o f the most exalted attributes^
(An-Nahl 16:60)
Meaning, that all His attributes are exalted; there is no
imperfection in any of them, in any way.
As for Al-'Azim it is also an adjective - and its meaning is
the possessor of Magnificence; and that is power, pride,
and the like from what is known of what is indicated by
this word.
This Ayah contains five of Allah's Names: Allah, Al-Hayy,
Al-Qayyiim, Al-'Aliyy, and Al-'Azim.
It also contains twenty-six of Allah's Attributes, five of
which are the Attributes contained in these Names.
The sixth: That Al-Uliihiyyah (divinity) is solely His.
The seventh: Negating slumber and sleep from Him, due
to the perfection of His living and maintaining.
The eighth: The comprehensiveness of His Sovereignty,

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

229

according to His saying: 4For Him is what is in the heavens
and in the earthy
The ninth: That the Sovereignty is solely Allah's, the
Mighty and Sublime. We derive this from Him putting the
predicate first.
The tenth: The power and perfection of His authority,
according to His saying: iW h o is he that can intercede before
Him, except with His permission?4
The eleventh: The affirmation of being in His presence.
This establishes that He is not everywhere. Therein is a
refutation against pantheism.
The twelfth: The affirmation of the permission, based on
His saying: 4^xcept with His permission4
The thirteenth: The comprehensiveness of the knowledge
of Allah, the Exalted; based on His statement: 4H e knows
what is in front o f them and what is behind them .4
The fourteenth and the fifteenth: That He, Glorious and
Exalted is He, does not forget what is in the past, based on
His saying: 4And what is behind them4 and He is not
ignorant of the future, based on His saying: 4Wlwt is in
front o f themfy

Commentary on A l-A qidah Al-Wasitiyyah

East while she is in the West. The commander will say to
the soldiers: "G o to the battle, and I am with you" while he
is in the office of the command, and they are on the
battlefield. So A l-M aiyyah never necessitates that the one is
with the other in his actual place. The meaning of AlMa'iyyah will be restricted according to what it is related to.
Sometimes, we therefore say, "This milk is with some
w ater." This kind of Al-Ma'iyyah indicates a mixture.
A man will say: "M y merchandise is with m e," while he is
in his house, not actually with it. And he can also say, while
carrying his merchandise with him: "M y merchandise is
with m e," while he is actually with it. So this is one, but its
meaning differs according to what is related to it. Due to
this, we say: Allah's Ma'iyyah with His creation is the one
that befits His 'Izzah (Honor and Might), Glorious and
Exalted is He, like the rest of His Attributes. So it is a
complete and Ma'iyyah, while He is above the heavens.
As for the evidence that falsifies their saying, from the view
of the intellect; we say that the claim that Allah is with you
in every place would necessitate many baseless implica­
tions. It would, therefore, imply:
Firstly: Multiplicity or division (of Allah). And this is
without a doubt an absurd implication. Therefore, the
absurdity of the implication proves the absurdity of what it
implies.
Secondly: We say that if you say He is with you in your
places, this implies that He increases the more the people
increase, and decreases the more the people decrease.
Thirdly: This will also imply that we not consider Him to
be far away from filthy locations! So when you say Allah is
with you, while you are on the toilet, this will be the
greatest disrespect for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

So with this, it is clear that their saying is a negation of the
revealed texts as well as the intellect, and that the Qur'an
does not prove that from any angle of indication; not a
complete indication, nor an inclusive indication, nor a
denotative indication.111
As for the other group, we say to them:
Your negation of a direction necessitates a negation of the
Lord, the Mighty and Sublime. Since we do not know of
anything that exists, that is neither above the universe, nor
below it, neither to right nor the left, not connected nor
separated, except that which does not exist. That is why
some scholars say, if it is said to us: "Describe Allah to us as
nothingness," we could not find a more truthful descrip­
tion of nothingness than this description.
Secondly: Your claim that affirming direction (for Allah)
implies that He possesses body. We would dispute with
you regarding the word body (Al-Jism). What is this body
for whose purpose you are driving people away from the
affirmation of Allah's Attributes? Do you mean by "bod y"
something that is formed from various things which are in
need of one another, each of which can not go on except
with the unity of these parts?! If you mean this, we do not
approve of that. We say Allah is not a bodily being in this
manner. Whoever says that the affirmation of His ‘Ulu
implies this kind of body, then his saying is a mere claim,
and it is enough for us to say that this is not acceptable!
But if you by body, a Self maintaining itself, described as is
befitting it, then we do affirm that. We say Allah, the
Exalted, definitely has an essence, maintaining Himself,
111

(Translation note): The Shaikh elaborated on these categories
earlier, see the comments on the author's saying: "They do
not engage in llhad concerning Allah's Names and His Ayat."

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

with the perfect Attributes. This is what everybody knows.
With this, the falsehood becomes clear regarding the saying
of these who affirm that Allah is Himself in every place, or
that Allah, the Exalted, is neither above the universe, nor
below it, neither connected to it, nor separate from it. We
say that He, the Mighty and Sublime, rose over His Throne.
As for the proofs for Al-'Ulu, which affirm the invalidity of
the saying of these people and those people, and those that
affirm what the People of the Sunnah and the Jam'ah say;
there are many evidences which could not be individually
counted. As for their types, they are five: The Book, the
Sunnah, consensus, intellect, and natural inclination (AlFitrah).
Regarding the Book; there are various categories of
evidence for Allah's 'Ulu mentioned therein. Among them,
the clear mention of Al-'Ulu (exaltedness) and Al-Fawqiyyah
(aboveness), and the ascension of things to Him, and their
descent from Him, and the like.
As for the Sunnah; similarly, there are various categories of
evidence for it. The three categories of Sunnah are
concordant on Allah's 'Ulu in His Self, for the affirmation
of Allah's 'Ulu in His Self has been established by the
saying of the Messenger jjjg, his actions, and his tacit
approvals.
As for consensus; before the appearance of these innovated
groups, the Muslims had a consensus that Allah, the
Exalted, had ascended above His Throne over His creation.
Shaikh Al-Islam, may Allah have mercy upon him, said:
"There is not - in Allah's Speech, nor His Messenger's, nor
in the speech of the Companions, nor those who followed
them faithfully - anything that proves - not a text, nor what
is apparent - that Allah, the Exalted, is not above the
Throne, nor above the heavens. Rather, all their sayings are

in agreement that Allah is above everything.”
As for the intellect, then we say that everyone knows that
Al-'Ulu (exaltedness) is an attribute of perfection; and when
it is an attribute of perfection, then it must be affirmed for
Allah, because Allah is described with the Attributes of
perfection. As such we say: Allah is either up, below or
beside. Being below or beside is not possible, because
below is a form of imperfection in its meaning, while beside
is a form of imperfection because it resembles and makes
Him like the creatures. Nothing, therefore, remains except
Al-'Ulu (exaltedness). This is another perspective based on
intellect.
As for natural inclination (A l-F itrah ); then we say that no
one will say "O Lord!” except that he finds, in his heart, the
necessity to seek the exalted.
These five evidences are therefore in conformity.
As for the exaltedness of the Attributes, it is an area of
consensus among all who confess or practice Islam.

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, based on His saying: iA l‘Azim^

That is why, whoever recites this Ayah during a night, a
guard from Allah will remain with him, and no Shaitan
will come near him until dawn.

•

Concerning the author's statement: "That is why,
whoever recites this Ayah during a night, a guard from
Allah will remain with him, and no Shaitan will come near
him until dawn."

The Commentary
This is a part of a Hadith reported by Al-Bukhari from Abu
Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, in the story
when the Prophet
made him a guard over the Sadaqah.
He, may Allah be pleased with him, apprehended a Shaitan
there, and he said to Abu Hurairah: "W hen you go to your
bed, recite Ayat Al-Kursi - $Alldh, there is no lldh except
Him, Al-Hayyu Al-Qayyumf (Al-Baqarah 2:255) until the
end of the Ayah - A guard from Allah will remain with
you, and no Shaitan will approach you until daw n." Abu
Hurairah informed the Prophet ji ; of this, and he (the
Messenger
then said: "H e told the truth to you, but
he is a liar."*1!

It has been referenced previously.

And His saying, Glorious is H e;

"He is Al-Awwal (the First), Al-Akhir (the Last), AzZahir, and Al-Batin. And He knows all things." (AlHadid 57:3)” .

#

Concerning the author's statement: "And His saying,
Glorious is H e; $He is Al-Awwal (the First), Al-Akhir
(the Last), Az-Zahir, and Al-Batin. And He knows all
things.Y' (Al-Hadid 57:3)” .

The Commentary
❖

Concerning his statement: "Glorious is H e" ; this is
joined with the statement of the author when he said:
"What Allah attributed to H im self in Surat Al-Ikhlas."

4 Al-Awwal (the First), Al-Akhir (the Last), Az-Zahir, and
Al-Batin4; these are four Names. They are opposite in
terms of time and place. They imply that Allah, Glorious
and Exalted is He, encompasses everything (in knowl­
edge), first and last; and like that with respect to place.
So in that, is an encompassing of time and place.
4 He is Al-Awwal (the First)4- The Prophet
explained
this in his statement: "The One before whom there was
nothing.” 111
Here, he explained an affirmation with a negation. He,
therefore, made this affirming attribute an attribute of
111

Reported by Muslim (2713) from the Hadith of Abu
Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him.

238

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

negation. We have earlier mentioned that the attributes of
affirmation are more perfect and numerous. Then, why
(did the Messenger convert an affirming attribute to an
attribute of negation)?
We answer thus: The Prophet
explained this for the
purpose of emphasizing His precedence, meaning that it is
absolute, a precedence that is not relative; so, it is said:
"This is the first with respect to what comes after it;" while
there is another thing before it. His explanation with a
negation therefore proves, in a broad way, that it is an
absoluteness precedence, that is why he 3jj| said: "The One
before whom there was nothing." This is with respect to
precedence in time.
iA l-A khir (the Last)}: The Prophet M, explained it in his
saying: "The One after whom there is nothing." It should
not be wrongly assumed that this proves that He is last
in the absolute sense, because there things that will exist
forever, and they are creatures; such as Paradise and Fire.
Based on this, the meaning of iA l-A khir (the Last)} is that
He encompasses everything, and there is therefore no
end to Him being the Last.
iA z-Z ahir}: From the word Az-Zuhur and it is Al-'Ulu
(exaltedness), as Allah, the Exalted, says:

4 He it is Who has sent His Messenger with guidance
and the true religion, liyuzhirahu (that He may make it
prevail) over all religion} (At-Tawbah 9:33)
That is to exalt it, and from this (word) we have the Zahr
(back) of an animal, because it (the back) is at the top of the
animal. Similar to this is His statement:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

239

}So they (Ya’juj and Ma'juj) were not able to scale it}
(Al-Kahf 18:97)
That is rise above it. Regarding its explanation, the Prophet
ill said: "The One above whom there is nothing” So He is
High above everything.
❖

}A nd Al-Batin} The Prophet
explained it, saying:
"The one beneath whom there is nothing.” And this
is due to His encompessing everything, but the
meaning is that with His, the Mighty and Sublime,
exaltedness, He is the most Near. His exaltedness
does not negate His nearness. So Al-Batin is near,
from the meaning Al-Qanb (close, near)

Four names of Allah are indicated to us in this noble Ayah,
they are: Al-Awwal (the First), Al-Akhir (the Last), Az-Zahir,
and Al-Batin, and five Attributes are indicated to us in it:
being the First, being the Last, being the Most Exalted, and
being Nearest, and the absoluteness of (His) knowledge.
If somebody asks: "A re these names interwoven in a way
that if you say the First you must say the Last, or is it
allowed that they be separated from each other?” What is
apparent is that the opposites among them are interrelated.
If you therefore say the First, you must say the Last. If you
say Az-Zahir, you must say Al-Batin, so that the other
Attribute which, along with it, indicates His encompassing
(everything) is not left out.
❖

Concerning His statement: }H e knows all things}

This completes what preceded regarding the four men­
tioned Attributes; meaning, and with that, He knows
everything.
This is a form of generality into which specificity can never

things include complete mindfulness of Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, the fear of Him, such that one will not feel
remorse over what He commands him, nor have an
opinion over what He prohibited him from.

His statement, Glorious is H e; $And have Tawwakul
upon Al-Hayyu, the One Who dies not.* (Al-Furqdn
25:58)"

•

Concerning the author's statement: "His statement,
Glorious is H e;

4,And have Tawwakul upon Al-Hayyu, the One Who
dies notfy (Al-Furqdn 25:58)"
The Commentary
❖

Tawakkul: is derived from Wakala (entrusting) some­
thing to another, that is, to consign (the matter) to it. So
the Tawwakul upon another, is to consign it to him.

Some scholars define Tawakkul upon Allah as sincere
reliance upon Him in conferring benefit and protection
from harm, while having trust in Him, Glorious and
Exalted is He, and while using the correct means. And
sincere reliance means that you rely upon Allah sincerely,
such that you do not ask except from Allah, and you do not

242

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

seek help, except from Allah; you do not have hope, except
in Allah, you do not fear except Allah. So you rely upon
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, to bring you benefit and to
save you from harm. This reliance without trust in Him,
and without using the permissible means (to achieve one's
good) will not suffice; you should have trust in Him
without any doubt while you use the permissible means
towards achieving (the benefit or protection from harm).
Whoever does not rely upon Allah, but relies upon his
ability, then he will be disgraced. The evidence for this is
what happened to the Companions with their Prophet jg at
the Battle of Hunain, about which, Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, says:

iT ru ely, Allah has given you victory on many
battlefields, and on the day o f Hunain, when you
rejoiced at your great numbers$ (At-Tawbah 9:25)
when they said: "W e shall not be conquered today as a
result of small nu m ber."^

[11

Based on what was reported by Al-BaihaqI in Ad-Dala’il
(5:123) from Rubai' "On the Day of Hunain, a man said: 'We
shall not be conquered due us being few.' So that disturbed
the Prophet jg, and that was the routing." In Al-Fath (8:27),
Al-Hafiz referred it to Yunus bin Bukair in Ziyadat Al-Magdzi,
and its chain is Mu'dal (two successive narrators are missing
between the collector the one he is narrating it from).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

243

iB ut it availed you naught; and the earth, with all its
vastness, was straitened for you, and then you turned back
in flight. Then Allah did send down His Sakinah upon His
Messenger, and upon the believers, and He sent down
forces which you did not see} (At-Tawbah 9:25,26)
The one who relies upon Allah, but fails to use the means
which Allah permits for it (his goal), such is not sincere.
Rather, to not use the means is a form of foolishness in the
intellect, and defeceincy in the religion, because it is an
obvious criticism of Allah's wisdom.
Reliance upon Allah is a half of the religion, as Allah says:

iYou alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help}
(Al-Fatihah 1:5).
To seek the help of Allah, the Exalted, is one of the fruits of
Tawakkul;

4 So worship Him, and rely upon Him } (Hud 11:123)
Based upon this, whoever has Tawakkul upon other than
Allah, then he will belong to one of these three categories:
Firstly: To have Tawakkul as reliance and a form of
worship; so this is major Shirk. It is as if he believes that
the one relied upon is the one who brings every good to
him, and prevents every harm from him, and he therefore
surrenders all his affairs to him completely, with respect to
bringing benefit and preventing harm, combined with fear
(of the person) and hope in him. There is no difference
whether the one relied on is alive or dead; this is because
this type of surrending affairs is not correct except to Allah.
Secondly: To have Tawakkul upon other than Allah with

244

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

some of dependance, but with the belief that this is as a
means, and that the affair is up to Allah; such as the
reliance of many people on the kings and leaders regarding
attaining their livelihood. This is a form of minor Shirk.
Thirdly: To rely on a person because he (the one relying) is
a representative of his, and that the one relied upon is
above him, such as a person's reliance on an agent for his
buying and selling, and the like in m atters where
representation is allowed. This is allowed, and does not
negate reliance upon Allah. The Prophet
authorized his
Companions for buying, selling and the like.
❖

Concerning His statement: "<$upon Al-Hayyu, the One
Who dies n o ty

They say that when a ruling is connected with an Attribute,
it indicates an elevation of that Attribute.
If someone asks: Why does the Ayah not read as follows:
"H ave Tawakkul upon Al-Qawiyy (the Powerful) and Al'Izzah (the M ighty)" because power and might are more
appropriate from what is clear?
The reply: The reason is because the status of the idols,
which these people depended upon, were that of being
dead, as Allah, the Exalted said:

$Those whom they invoke besides Allah have not created
anything, but they are themselves created. Dead, not
living; and they know not when they will be raised$
(An-Nahl 16:20,21).
So He is saying that you should rely upon the One whose
attribute is not like the attribute of these idols; He is Al-

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

245

Hayyu, the One Who dies not, even though He says in
another Ayah:

$And rely upon Al-'Aziz (the Mighty), Ar-Rahim (the
Merciful)$> (Ash-Shu'ara 26:217)
This is because might was more suitable in that context.
Another perspective is that Al-Hayyu is a name that
comprises all the perect Attributes of life. And among the
perfection of His Life, the Mighty and Sublime, is that He is
the One suitable to be depended upon.
❖

Concerning his statement: "4 ••.Who dies not...y."
meaning, due to the perfection of His Life, He dies
not. So the objective of connecting that to what was
before it, is that this is a perfect Life, which cannot
be touched with extinction.

Among the Names of Allah contained in this Ayah: AlHayyu, and among His Attributes: Life, and the absence of
death, which comprises perferction of the life. So there are
two Attributes, and one Name in it.

And His saying: 4And He is Al-'Ahm, Al-Hakimty (AtTahrim 66:2)

#

The author's statement: "And His saying:

246

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

<$And He is Al-'AUm, Al-Hakim£ (At-Tahrim 66:2)
The Commentary
❖

Concerning His statement: iA nd He is Al-'Alim?, the
definition of knowledge preceded, and that the
Knowledge is an attribute of perfection, as well as
the fact that Allah's encompasses everything, also
preceded.

❖

But as for: iAl-Hakimty) Ha - Kdf- Mim refers to ruling
and accuracy. Based on the first (meaning) Al-Hakim
will be the Law-Giver, while according to the second
(meaning) Al-Hakim will mean the One Who is Accu­
rate. Therefore, this noble Name indicates that the rule
belongs to Allah, and it indicates that Allah is described
with wisdom, because accuracy means precision, while
precision means to put a thing in its place.

So in the Ayah is an affirmation of judgment and wisdom.
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, alone is the Law-Giver. The
law of Allah is either of the universal or Shari'ah type. So
the Shan ah laws of Allah are the legislations of religion that
His Messengers came with, those that His Books were
revealed with. The universal laws of Allah are what He
decreed upon His servants, in terms of how they were
created, provisions, life, death and the like that, all of which
falls under the meaning of His Lordship and its implica­
tions.
The evidence for the Shari'ah law, is His, the Exalted,
statement regarding one of Yusuf's brothers:

4 Therefore, I will not leave this land until my father

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

247

permits me, or Allah decides my case. And He is the
Best o f the j u d g e s ( Y u s u f 1 2 :80)
But as for His, the Exalted, statement:

}Is not Allah the Most Just o f ju dges?} (At-Tin 95:8)
It includes both the universal and Shari'ah type. Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, is therefore wise with the universal
law and the S harf ah law, and He is also Accurate in both of
these; so each of the two rulings are in accord with wisdom.
But there is what we know of wisdom, and that which we
do not know of wisdom, because Allah, the Exalted, says:

}A n d o f knowledge, you have been given only a little}
(Al-Isra' 17:85)
Then, wisdom is of two types:
The first: The wisdom behind something, being in how it
is, and the condition which it is, such as in the case of the
Salah. It is a great form of worship that is preceded by
purification from major and minor impurities, and it is
performed in a particular form consisting of standing,
sitting, bowing and prostration. And the Zakah, which is a
form of worshipping Allah, the Exalted, by giving a part of
increased wealth, usually for those who are in need of it, or
those that the Muslims have a need for, such as some
whose hearts are inclined towards Islam.
The second type: The wisdom in the objective of the law,
since all the rulings of Allah have commendable aims and
beautiful fruits. Consider Allah's wisdom behind His
universal law; His inflicting great tribulations upon people
for commendable goals, as is in His, the Exalted, statement:

248

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4 Corruption has appeared on land and sea because o f
what the hands o f men have earned, that He may make
them taste a part o f that which they have done, in order
that they may return4 (Ar-Rum 30: 41).
In this, there is a refutation of those who say: The
judgments of Allah, the Exalted, are not based on any
particular wisdom, but merely what Allah willed.
Among Allah's Names in this Ayah are: Al-'Alim and AlHakim. And among His Attributes are the Knowledge and
the Wisdom.
And in it there are behavioral benefits; faith in the
Knowledge of Allah, and His W isdom, necessitates
complete tranquility with whatever universal and Shari ah
laws He decreed, since that is based on knowledge and
wisdom. Therefore, the soul's anxiety disappears, and the
breast expands.

And His statement: 4 Al-'Alim, Al-Khabir4 (At-Tahrim
66:3)''

•

"And His statement:

4 Al-'Alim, A l-Khabirf (At-Tahrim 66:3)"

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

249

The Commentary
❖

iA l-A lim y . The discussion regarding it preceded.

❖

jA l-K habfrf: It means the Knower of the secrets of
affairs. This will therefore be a more specific Attri­
bute following a more general Attribute. We say the
Knower of the obvious affairs and the All-Aware of
the hidden secret affairs; which therefore means that
having the knowledge of the hidden is mentioned
twice; once in a general manner, and the other in a
specific manner, so that it will not be assumed that
His knowledge is restricted to the obvious matters
only.

As this can be with regard to meanings, it can also occur
with respect to individual subjects, for example:

$ Therein descend Angels and the S p i r i t (Al-Qadr 97:4)
The Spirit is Jibrll, and he is among the Angels. We
therefore say it means, the Angels among whom is Jibril.
So, Jibril is specially mentioned as a form of honor for him,
and the mention of him is made twice; once in a general
manner and one in a special manner.
Among the Names of Allah in this Ayah are: Al-'Alim and
Al-Khabir, and among His Attributes are; Knowledge and
Absolute Awareness
And in it there are behavioral benefits; that a man's faith in
that increases his fear and fright of Allah, secretly and
openly.

And His statement:

The Commentary
In these Ayat are details about the Attribute of Knowledge.
The first Ayah:

4 fie that which goes into the earth, and that which
comes forth from it, and that which descends from the

252

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

heaven, and that which ascends to it $(Saba' 34:2)
These are details about what preceded regarding the
absoluteness of Allah's Knowledge.
All that goes into the earth, such as the rain, the seed that is
sown in the earth, the dead, the worms, the ants and others
4 and that which goes comes forth from it$ such as water,
plants and the like ia n d that which descends from the
heaven^ such as rain, revelation, the Angels, and the
decrees of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime; ia n d that
which ascends to ify such as the righteous deeds, the
Angels, the souls and the supplications.
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, mentions the absoluteness
of His Knowledge in this Ayah, with different details. He
then elaborates with more details in other Ayat.
The second Ayah:

iA n d with Him are the Mafdtih (keys) o f the G haib;
none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there
is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls but He
knows it. There is not a seed in the darkness o f the
earth, nor anything fresh or dry, but it is written in a
Kitabin Mubin (Clear Record)^ (Al-An'am 6:59)
❖

iW ith Him]*: that is with Allah; it is a predicate that
is made to precede (the subject). iT h e key s i is a
subject that is suspended. This construction indicates
restriction and specificity. Meaning, the keys of all
that is hidden are with Him, not other than Him. He
emphasizes this restriction with His statement: $none

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

253

knows them but H e}. In the sentence, there is a
restriction that the keys of this knowledge are with
Allah via two ways: One of them is through the way
of bringing forward (some sentence elements) and
bringing later (another). The second is through the
means of negation and affirmation.
❖

The word Mafatih is said to be the plural of the word
Miftah which means the key with which a door is
opened; but Mafatih is rarely used as the plural of
Miftah. It is also said that Mafatih is the plural of Maftih
which means the treasures; therefore the Mafatih of the
Ghaib are with Him; (that is) its treasures. It is also said
iThe Mafatih of the Ghaib} means its beginning.
Because the key of everything is at its beginning,
Mafatih of the Ghaib will now be based on this, the
beginning of Ghaib because all of what is mentioned
are things that are the beginning of what comes after
them.

❖

}The Ghaib}-, what is intended with Ghaib is the
hidden. What is hidden is relative, but the absoulte
knowledge of the hidden matters is specifically with
Allah.

These Mafatih, whether we say that it means the beginning,
or the treasuries, or the keys, nobody knows them except
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. No Angel knows them, no
Messenger knows them, so much that the most honorable
of Angel Messengers - Jibril - asked the most honorable of
human Messengers - Muhammad
- and said: "Inform
me of the Last Hour?” He 0 , replied: "The one being asked
is not more knowledgeable about that than the one
asking.” ^1'
It was referenced earlier.

254

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The meaning is that as you do not know it, I do not know it
either. Whoever claims the knowledge of the Hour is a liar,
and a disbeliever. W hoever believes him is also a
disbeliever, because he belied the Qur'an.
The most knowledgeable regarding Allah's words Muhammad
- has explained the Mafatili, when he
recited:

4 Verily, Allah, with Him (Alone) is the knowledge of
the Hour. And He sends down the Ghaith, and He
knows what is in the wombs. And no soul knows what
it will earn tomorrow, and no soul knows in what land
it will die. Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware4
(Luqman$ 31:34)^
There are five matters in it:
The First: Knowledge of the Hour; knowledge of the Hour
is the beginning of the life of the Hereafter. The Hour is
called so because it is a tremendous Hour, all people are
threatened by it. It is Al-Haqqah (the Inevitable) and AlWaqi'ah (the Great Event). The knowledge of the Hour is
with Allah. No one knows when it shall be except Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime.
The Second: Sending down the Ghaith from His saying:
4 And He sends down the Ghaith4: iThe Ghaith4 is an
infinitive, meaning; elimination of adversity. What is
Reported by Al-Bukhari (4778) from Ibn Umar, may Allah be
pleased with him.

intended by it, is the rain, because the adversity of
drought is eliminated by the rain. Since He is the One
Who sends down the rain, He is the One Who knows the
time of its falling.
The falling of rain is the key to the life of the earth, and with
the growth of plants, there is good for the pasture and all
other things that people benefit from. Here is an important
point: $And He sends down the Ghaith}, He did not say:
"H e sends down the rain {Al-Matr)" because rain some­
times falls but without leading to the growth of plants,
so it will not eliminate adversity, and the land will not
be revived by it. That is why it is confirmed in Sahih
Muslim: "Drought is not when you are not provided with
rain, but the drought is when you are provided with rain
and the earth does not sprout anything.
The Third: The knowledge of what is in the wombs, based
on His statement: iand He knows what is in the wombs.
that is, the wombs of females. He, the Mighty and
Sublime, knows what is in the wombs. That is, what is in
the wombs of the mothers of sons of Adam and other
than them. What He knows is general; (that is) He knows
everything. What is in the wombs will not be known
except by He, the Mighty and Sublime, who created it.
If you say it is said today: They (the doctors) now know
what is contained in the womb; whether a male or a female.
Is this correct? We reply: This happens; it is not possible to
deny that, but they cannot know that except after the
formation of the fetus and the appearance of its sex. There
are other conditions of the fetus that they do not actually
know. They do not know when (exactly) it will be
[1] Reported by Muslim (2904) from Abu Hurairah, may Allah be
pleased with him.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

delivered, or when it is delivered, for how long will it
remain alive. They do not know whether it will be a
miserable (being) or a successful (one). They do not know
whether it will be wealthy or poor, and other conditions
that are not known. Therefore, most of what has to do with
the fetuses are matters that are unknown to the creatures,
thus the correctness of the general statement: $and He
knows what is in the wombs$
The Fourth: The knowledge of what happens tomorrow;
which is what is after today, based on His statement: 4 And
no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow& This is the key
of attainment of what is in the future. If a person does
not know what he will earn for himself, then, that he
does not know what another person will earn is fore­
most. But if somebody says: "I know what will happen
tomorrow. I shall go to so-and-so place tomorrow,” or "I
will read” or "I will visit my relatives.” We say that he
can plan what he will do, but something can prevent
him from doing it.
The Fifth: The knowledge of the place of death; based on
His statement: $and no soul knows in what land it will diefy
No one knows whether he will die in his land or in
another land; in an Islamic land or among disbelievers.
He does not know whether he will die at sea, on land, or
in the air. This is what is witnessed. And he does not
know what hour he will die, because if it is not possible
for him to know where he will die, he can stay at one a
place, but even still, he does not know what time or hour
he will die.
These five are the keys of the Ghaib which are not known by
anyone except Allah. They are referred to as the keys of the
Ghaib; because the knowledge of what is in the wombs is a
key to the life of this world; 4And no soul knows what it will

257

earn tomorrow4 is a key for future action; ia n d no soul
knows in what land it will diefy, is the key to the life of the
Hereafter. This is because if a person dies, he enters into
the world of the Hereafter. The explanation regarding the
knowledge of the Hour and sending down the Ghaith has
preceded. It, therefore, becomes clear that all of these
keys are the foundations for all that comes after them;
4 Verily, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware4
❖

Then, He, the Mighty and Sublime, said: 4And He
knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea4; this
is a form of generalization. Who can count the
species on the land? How many realms are there, be
they animals, insects, mountains, trees and rivers that
nobody knows about except Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime? The sea is also like that. Therein are worlds
that none knows about except their Creator, the
Mighty and Sublime. They say the seas have more
than three times the species that are on the earth,
because the seas are vaster than the lands.

Then He, the Mighty and Sublime, said:

4not a leaf falls but He Knows it4 (Al-An'am 6:59)
This refers to the details; any leaf on any tree, large or
small, near or far, that falls, Allah, the Exalted, knows of it.
The tree that is created, He knows it in the best manner,
because the One Who knows what falls, knows what He,
the Mighty and Sublime, creates.
Consider the vastness of the knowledge of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, everything that exists, He knows it;
even that which has not happened and what shall happen,
He, the Exalted, knows it.

He said: iThere is not a seed in the darkness of the earthy, a
small seed not visible to the eyes in the darkness of the

iDarknessy. Let's assume there is a small seed
submerged in a seabed, during a dark and rainy
night, the kinds of darkness then are; firstly: the sea
soil, secondly: the sea w ater, thirdly: the rain,
fourthly: the clouds, fifthly: the night. These are five
kinds of darkness among the kinds of darkness of the
earth. Yet with this, Allah, the Exalted, knows about
this seed, and He, the Mighty and Sublime, sees it.

He said: $nor anything fresh or dry$ this is general;
there is nothing except that it is either fresh or dry.

❖

He said: ibut it is written in a Kitdbin Mubin (Clear
Record).y i K i t a b i n meaning what is written.
4_Mubin^, meaning what is made manifest and
evident, because the verb Abana can be used as a
transitive and an intransitive. It will therefore be said
"The dawn is clear (Aban)" meaning the dawn is
manifest, and it can also be said: "The truth is made
clear (Aban)'' meaning it is made manifest. What is
intended by the Record here is the Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz
(the Preserved Tablet). All of these things are known
to Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, and are written
with Him in Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz (the Preserved
Tablet), because Allah, the Exalted: "W hen He cre­
ated the Pen, He said to it: 'W rite.' The pen said:
'W hat should I write?' He said: 'W rite whatever shall
be until the Day of Resurrection.'"^

Whatever shall be till the Day of Resurrection was therefore
written. Then He, Glorious and Exalted is He, put records
in the hands of the Angels, in order that they write what a
person does, because that which is written in the Preserved
Tablet is what a person will want to do, while the record
which the Angels write will be the one based upon which a
person will be rewarded or punished. Thus, Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, said:

<$And surely We shall try you, until We test those
among you who strive hard, and the patient^
(Muhammad 47:31).
But as for His knowledge that His servant So-and-so shall
be patient or not, that has preceded, but neither reward nor
punishment is based on this.
The Third Ayah:

4And no fem ale conceives or gives birth but with His
Knowledge^ (Al-Fdtir 35:11)
❖

His statement: ^ Female^ includes any female; whether
human or any other animal that conceives another
animal. It is clear that such are included in this Ayah,
such as the cow, the camel, the sheep and the like.
Also included here is anything that lays eggs, such as
birds, because eggs develop inside a bird.

Shari'ah (178), Ibn Abl 'Asim in As-Sunnah (105) and the
Hadith was graded Sahih in As-Sahihah (133) and in AsSunnah of Ibn Abi 'Asim (1:48-49).

4 lt is Allah Who has created seven heavens and o f the earth
the like thereof (seven). His Command descends between
them (the heavens and the earth) that you may know that
Allah has power over all things, and that Allah encom­
passes all things with His knowledge$ (At-Talaq 65:12)
He has created these seven heavens and the seven earths
and made us know of that, so that we may know, 4 that
Allah has power over all things$
Power (Al-Qudrah) is a description in which the powerful
one is able to do what he wills to do, without any
incapability. He has the power over all things. He has the
power of creating what is non-existent and of exterminat­
ing what exists. The heavens and the earth were earlier
non-existent, then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, created
and originated them in this wonderful congruence.

4And that Allah encompasses all things with His
k n o w led ge: everything small or large, related to His
actions, or the actions of His servants, the future or
the present; all of these, Allah, the Glorious is He,
encompasses them in His knowledge.

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, mentioned knowledge and
power after the creation, because creation will not be
complete except with knowledge and power. The reference
of creation to knowledge and power is of the denotative
indication. It has preceded that indications implied by the
Names (of Allah) regarding the Attributes (of Allah) are of
three types.
Caution: It is mentioned in Tajsir Al-Jalalain, may Allah
forgive us and him, at the end of Surat Al-Ma'idah\
"Contemplation of the intellect excludes His Self, He does
not therefore have power over it (His Self)."
We dispute this statement from two perspectives:
The First Perspective: There is no room for intellectual
contemplation in the matter concerning the Self of Allah
and His Attributes. There is even no consideration for
intellectual contemplation in all the matters of the Ghaib.
The function of the intellect in this matter is to completely
surrender, and that we know that what Allah mentions of
these matters are not impossible. That is why it is said:
"The textual proofs do bring impossibilities, but they
indeed bring replies" meaning - what replies to faculties of
the intellect, because they (faculties of the intellect) hear
what they cannot comprehend nor imagine.
(Translation note): The Shaikh elaborated on these
categories earlier, see the comments on the author's
saying: "They do not engage in Ilhad concerning Allah's
Names and His Ayat."

262

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The Second Perspective: His statement: "H e, therefore,
does not have power over it (His Self)" this is a great
mistake. How does He not have power over Himself, when
He has power over all other things. This statement of his
implies that He does not have power to rise over His
Throne, to Speak, and to descend to the lowest heaven. He
never does anything. This is a very serious mistake!!
But if somebody says that maybe by his saying "the
intellect excludes His Self; He does not, therefore, have
power over it (His Self)," he intended that He does not
have power to affiliate imperfection to Himself. We reply
that this matter is not a matter of absolute generalization,
such that it would need specification and particularization.
This is because power has to do with possible matters,
because what is impossible is not considered something;
not outside nor inside the intellect. Power does not have to
do with impossibility, unlike knowledge.
So it is necessary that a person be cautious concerning the
matters of Lordship, because its status is a tremendous one,
and as such what is compulsory upon a man regarding it, is
to surrender and accept it. Therefore, we would generalize
what Allah generalizes, and we say that Allah has power
over all things, without exception.
Among the Attributes of Allah, the Exalted, in these Ayat
are: The affirmation of the absolute knowledge of Allah in
an elaborate manner, and the affirmation of the absolute
power of Allah, the Exalted.
The behavioral benefit derivable from faith in the knowl­
edge and power is that one has strong awareness that Allah
is watching, and the fear of Him.

So, people are in need of Allah's provision, but Allah, the
Exalted, does not want any provision from them, nor that
should they feed Him.

}A r-Razzdq} : is a form indicating extensiveness,111
from Rizq (provision) that is "th e gift." He, the
Exalted, said:

4And when the relatives and the orphans and AlMasakin (the poor) are present at the time of division,
then provide them (Farzuquhum) something from it (the
p r o p e r t y (An-Nisd'4:8)
Meaning, give to them. During his Salah, a person asks
Allah, saying: "Allahummarzuqni (O Allah, provide for
me)."
A r-R izq (provision) is divided into two categories: General
and specific.
The general includes everything from which the body
benefits, whether lawful or unlawful, whether the one
provided for is a Muslim or a disbeliever. That is why, AsSafariru said:[1]
And Ar-Rizq is what is benefited from, of what is lawful;
Or its opposite, therefore, dismiss the absurd
For He is the Provider for all creations
And the creature exists not without any provision
For if you say that Rizq is only the lawful gift, it would
therefore mean that all of those who eat the unlawful are
not being provided for, despite the fact that Allah gives
them what their bodies benefit from. But provision is of
two types: Good and filthy. That is why Allah, the Exalted,
says:

265

(Al-A'raf

And He did not say "and provision."111 But as for the filthy
things among the provisions, it refers to the unlawful.
As for specific provision, it refers to what the religion is
established with, like beneficial knowledge, righteous
deeds, and lawful provisions that aid in the obedience of
Allah. That is, Ar-Razzaq is stated in the noble Ayah, and He
did not say: Ar-Raziq (the Provider); due to the abundance
of His provision and the plentiness of those that He
provides for. Those whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
provides for, in the case of their categories, cannot be
counted, not to mention how many individually. Allah, the
Exalted, says:
/ *«'' * A*

fA nd there is no moving creature on the earth, but it is
for Allah to provide it with provision. And He knows
its dwelling place, and its deposit.$ (Hud 11:6).
And Allah provides Rizq in accord with the circumstance.
But if somebody says: "If Allah is Ar-Razzaq, then should I
strive to seek provisions, or I should stay in my home, and
let provisions come to m e?"
Then the reply is that we say to strive in search for
provisions. Just as Allah pardons, this does not mean that
you should not do any good deed, and not seek the means
of forgiveness.
111

(Translation note): Meaning, "good things from," not
"good things, and" indicating that the good things are
one category of Ar-Rizq.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Regarding the statement of a poet:
It is insanity for you to strive for provision While in its covering, the fetus is provided fo r.
This statement is false. As for using the condition of a fetus
as a basis of evidence, the reply is to say that it is not
possible that a fetus seek its provisions, because it does not
have the ability, contrary to the one who is able. As such,
Allah, the Exalted, said:

Concerning His statement: j D h u l - Q u w w a h A l Quwwah is an attribute with which the doer is able to

based on His, the Exalted, saying:

}A nd Allah is not such that anything in the heavens or
the earth escapes Him.Verily, He is 'Altman (Knowing),
Qadiran (Able)} (Fdtir 35:44)
The opposite of Qudrah (ability) is incapability while the
opposite of Quwwah (strength) is weakness.
The difference between them is that Qudrah (ability) is used
for conscious beings only, while Quwwah (strength) is used
for conscious and non-conscious beings. Secondly; Quwwah
(strength) is more specific. Every conscious being that has
strength, has ability, but not every able one is strong. For
example, you say that the wind is strong (Qawiyyatun), but
you do not say Qadiratun (it is able). You say iron is
Qawwiyun (strong) but you do not say it is Qadirun (able).
But as regards the conscious being, you say he is Qawiyun
(strong) and he is Qadirun (able).
When the people of 'Ad said:

}Who is mightier than us in strength? }
Allah, the Exalted, said:

}D o they not see, that Allah, Who created them, is
mightier than they in strength? } (Fussilat 41:15)

Concerning His saying: }Al-Matfn} Ibn 'Abbas, may
Allah be pleased with him ,^ said it means AshR ep orted by Al-BaihaqI, in Al-Asma was-Sifdt (68), and AsSuyuti mentioned it in Ad-Durr Al-Manthiir (6:142) and
attributed it to Ibn Abi Hatim.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Shadid (the firm, severe, or strong). That is, firm in
His strength, firm in His 'Izzah (honor, might), firm
in all the attributes of arrogance, and considering its
meaning, it is a form of emphasis of for strength.
And we can say regarding Allah that He is Shadid,
but we cannot call Allah Ash-Shadid (the Strong,
meaning, as a Name); but we rather call Him AlMatin (the Firm) because Allah calls Himself that.
In this Ayah, there is an affirmation of two of Allah's
Names; they are: Ar-Razzdq, and Al-M atin, and the
affirmation of three Attributes, they are: provision, strength
and what the Name Al-Matin contains.
The behavioural benefit derivable from faith in the
Attributes of strength and provision, is that we would
not seek strength and provision except from Allah, the
Exalted, and that we believe that every form of strength,
regardless of how tremendous it is, cannot oppose the
strength of Allah, the Exalted.

His statement: iA n d He is As-SamTu (the Hearer), Al-

Basir (the Seer)y, iAs-Sami u ^has two meanings. One
of them is: the One who responds, and the second is: the
One who hears sounds. As for As-Sami'u with the
meaning the of the One who responds, they give an
example of it in Allah's statement regarding Ibrahim:

iSurely, my Lord is the Hearer of Prayer) (Ibrahim 14:39)
That is, responds to the supplication.
As for As-Sami u with the meaning of hearing sound, they
divide it into a number of categories:
Firstly: Hearing by which it is meant to clarify the
generality of the reach of the hearing of Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, and that there is no sound except that Allah
hears it.
Secondly: Hearing by which support and aid are intended.
Thirdly: Hearing by which threat and intimidation are
intended.
An example of the first is His statement:
4 ^ '

^ JiS-Ca? Jf\ j j l iuT

4 Indeed Allah has heard the statement of her that
disputes with you concerning her husband, and com­
plains to Allah4 (Al-Mujadilah 58:1)
In this is a clarification that the hearing of Allah, the
Exalted, encompasses all of what is audible. That is why
'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "All praise is
due to Allah whose hearing encompasses the voices. By
Allah! I was in the apartment, and some of her discussion
was hidden from m e ."^
The reference was cited previously.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

271

An example of the second is in His, the Exalted, saying to
Musa and Harun:

4 / am with you both. I hear and I see4 (Ta Ha 20:46)
An example of the third, by which threat and intimidation
is intended, is in His, the Exalted, saying:

444-^4 44jJ L-iijj $

4v? £-“•>^ ^ 4*-^

4Do f/icy think that We hear not their secrets and their
private counsels? Rather (We do) And Our Messengers
remain with them recording everything4 (Az-Zukhruf
43:80).
This was meant to intimidate and threaten them, since they
were trying to keep secret what He was not pleased with.
The hearing with the meaning of reaching all of what is
audible is one of the Attributes of Essence, even when the
audible matter could be something new. And hearing
which implies support and aid is among the Attributes of
doing, because it is related to a reason. Hearing with the
meaning of the response is also an Attribute of doing.
❖

Concerning His statement: 4 Al-Basir (the Seer)$
meaning the One who reaches all that is visible. And
Al-Basir is used generally to mean the ‘Alim (Know­
ing). Therefore, Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He,
Sees; He sees everything even if it is hidden and He,
Glorious is He, Sees, meaning He Knows the actions
of the servants. He, the Exalted, said:
4

iA nd Allah sees all of what you dofy (Al-Hujurdt 49:18)
And what we do is sometimes visible, while other times not

272

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

visible. As such, Allah's seeing is of two categories, and
each of them are included in His saying: 4Al-Basir (the
Seer)f
This Ayah includes an affirmation of two of Allah's Names;
they are: As-Sami'u (the Hearer) and Al-Basir (the Seer); and
three Attributes, which are: the perfection of His Attributes
in negating any likenesses, and hearing and seeing.
Of the behavioral benefits derivable from it, are refraining
from any attempt to liken Allah to any of His creation,
realizing His magnificence and perfection, and being
cautious, since He will see you if you do an act of
disobedience to Him, or hear you if you say what He is not
pleased with.
Know that the (Arabic) grammarians argue a lot regarding
His statement:

ilik e unto him 4
Such that they said that the letter K df that is used before the
word Mithl indicates that Allah has a likeness for which
there is nothing comparable, because He did not say: "not
as He is," He rather said: iT h ere is nothing like unto Him4
According to the expression, this is what is apparent in
the Ayah, but not its meaning. Because if we say that this
is its apparent meaning, then what is apparent from the
Qur'an would be disbelief, and this is impossible. That is
why the explanations of the gram m arians differed
regarding the grammatical analysis of this Ayah accord­
ing to a number of sayings:
The first view: The letter K df is an addition, and that the
usage of the statement is "nothing is like H im ." This is a
comfortable explanation. The use of additional letters in
negations is numerous; as it is in His, the Exalted, saying:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

$And none
35:11)[1]

conceives

among

fem ales...$

273

(Fdtir

They say that to use additional letters in the Arabic
Langusge for emphasis is an established practice.
The second view: They say the opposite. They say that the
addition is the word Mithl, and the usage is therefore:
"Nothing is as He is." But this is weak; it is weakened by
the fact that it is only in very few instances, or rare in
Arabic grammar, that nouns are used as additions, unlike
letters. So therefore, when there is no way around us saying
that there is an addition, then the letter Kafwill therefore be
considered the addition.
The third view: That the word Mithl means "description"
and the meaning will therefore be: "Nothing is like His
description." And they said: Al-Mithl, Al-Maihal, AshShibbh, and Ash-Shabbah have one meaning in the Arabic
Language, and Allah, the Exalted, said:

4Mathalul-]annah, which is promised for Al-Muttaqun
(the people ofTaqwa)£ (Muhammad 47:15)
Meaning, "description of Paradise." This is not far from
being correct.
The fourth view: That there is no addition in the Ayah. But
if you say: $There is nothing like unto Himfy it necessitates
negating any likeness, and when there is no likeness for
(Translation note): M eaning, "min (am ong)" is an
additional word, and H aru f in the Arabic Language can
mean a letter or word, while it mostly is used for letter.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

an example, the one that does exist becomes one. Based
upon this, there is no need for us to interpret it as
anything. They say this happens in the Arabic Language,
such as one's saying: "There is no boy like Zuhair."
The reality is that if such researches were not presented to
you, then the meaning of the Ayah would still be clear, and
its meaning is that Allah does not have an equal. But this
(discussion) is found in the books, and the preferred view is
that we say the letter K df is an addition, but the last
meaning is more comprehensive for the one that is able to
understand it.
❖

"And His saying:

iV erily, how excellent is the teaching which Allah gives
to you. Truly, Allah is Sami'an (Hearing), Basiran
(Seeing)^ (An-Nisa' 4:58)”
This Ayah is complementary to His statement:

iV erily, Allah commands that you should render back
the trusts to those whom they are due; and that when
you judge between the people, you judge with justice^
(An-Nisa' 4:58).
So He, the Mighty and Sublime, orders us to render what
was entrusted back to its people, and from this is that a
person bear witness, for him or against him, and that we
should judge whenever we judge between people, with
justice. Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, makes it clear
that He commands us to do what is obligatory in the means
of judgment, and the judgment itself. As for the means of

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

judgment; bearing witness falls under the genarality of His
statement:

}that you should render hack the trusts to those whom
they are due}
And the judgment:

4when you judge among people that you should judge
with justice}
Then, He, Glorious is He, says:

4Verily, how excellent is the teaching which Allah gives
to you}
❖

Concerning His statement: }Verily, how excellent is the
teaching which Allah gives to you} Allah, Glorious is
He, made the order of these two things - proper
rendering of the trusts and being just in judgment an exhortation, because it benefits the hearts, and
everything that benefits the hearts is considered an
exhortation, and there is no doubt that maintaining
these commands is beneficial for the heart.

❖

He then said: }Truly, Allah is Sami'an (Hearing),
Basiran (Seeing)} His saying Kdna (is/1' is a verb but
it is not considered to have any relationship with
time (here). It is only intended here to refer to an
Attribute. That is, Allah is described as hearing and
(Translation note): It is in the past tense (was) with the
meaning of (is).

276

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

seeing. We say, it is not connected with time, because
if we leave it upon its tense implication, it will mean
that this Attribute has stopped; He was hearing and
seeing earlier, as for now, then He is not like that! It
is well-known that this meaning is invalid and false,
and that the intent is only that He is described with
these two Attributes; hearing and seeing, forever. The
word Kana in this context is intended as a verifica­
tion.
❖

Concerning His statement: ^Sam ian (Hearing), Basiran
(Seeing)^ We say regarding this, as we said regarding
the preceding Ayah. In it, there is an affirmation of
hearing for Allah, with the two categories (previously
mentioned) and the affirmation of seeing, with the
two categories.

Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, recited this
Ayah, and said: "The Messenger #5 placed his thumb and
index finger on his eye and ea r."[1] The objective of placing
(of the fingers) like this, was to verify hearing and seeing;
not to affirm the eye and an ear; because the affirmation of
Eye comes in other proofs. The ear is neither affirmed for,
nor negated from Allah according to the People of the
Sunnah and the Jamd'ah, due to the absence of revealed texts
mentioning that.
If you say: "A m I allowed to do as the Messenger

did?”

The answer is that some of the scholars say yes, do as did
the Messenger; you are neither a better guide for creation
than the Messenger of Allah |jg, nor more careful in
attributing to Allah what befits Him than the Messenger m Among them are those who say that you do not have a
reason to do that, since we know that the objective was
Its reference was cited previously.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

277

verification. Therefore, this act itself was not intended; it's
objective was to prove something else. Therefore, you do
not have a cause to point, particularly when it is feared
from such pointing, that a person will assume Tamthil; such
as if there were before you, some avereage folk who do not
undertand anything as required, then this would require
you to be cautious against that, and there is a suitable
manner for every gathering.
Likewise, what is reported in the Hadith of Ibn 'Umar, may
Allah be pleased with him, wherein the Messenger of Allah
SH said: "Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, shall hold His
heavens and His earths with His two Hands, and say: 'I am
A llah'" And he clenched his fingers, and spread them
out.[1] So, what is said concerning this Hadith is what was
said regarding the Hadith of Abu Hurairah.
From the behavioural benefits in faith in the two Attributes
of hearing and seeing, is that we will be very cautious
against disobeying Allah in our speech and our actions.
And in this Ayah is the affirmation of two of Allah's Names:
As-Sami u, and Al-Basir.
And of the attributes; the affirmation of hearing, seeing,
and the command and exhortation.

Reported by Muslim (2788) from Ibn 'Umar, may Allah be
pleased with him.

is no strength but with A llah!"} (Al-Kahf 18:39).
❖

}V\/a Lawld} meaning "W hy did you not?” It is used
for specification, but what is intended by it here is
reproach, meaning that he reproached him for forsak­
ing this statement.

❖

}Y ou r garden)>: Al-Jannah means a very large garden
with many trees. It is so called because whoever is
inside it, is covered up by the trees and the branches
of the garden. He is thus, hidden inside them. And
this root (Jim and Nun) indicates covering, and from
it is Al-Junnah with Dammah on the Jim; that which
the person shields himself with during fighting; and
from it is Al-Jinnah with Kasra on the Jim meaning
the Jinn, because they are hidden.

❖

Concerning His statement: }Y ou r garden}; this is
singular, and what is known from the Ayat is that he
had two gardens, what is then the response since it is
singular here, despite the fact that there were two
gardens? The answer is to say that when the singular
noun is attributed (to something else) it becomes
general, it therefore covers the two gardens, or, that
the speaker wanted to belittle the status of the two
gardens. This is because this was stated to be an
admonishment, and to not be so amazed over what
Allah had provided for him. As if he was saying:
"These two gardens are one”, belittling their status.

The first view is closer to the principles of the Arabic
Language.
❖

And concerning His statement: }T h at which Allah wills
(will come to pass) there is no strength but with A llah};
Ma (that) can be a relative pronoun or a conditional
element. If you consider it a relative pronoun, it will

281

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

be taken to be the predicate of a subject that is
omitted, and the usage is: "T his is w hat Allah
willed.” That is, this is not of my volition, my
strength nor my might, but it is with the will of
Allah. Meaning, this is what Allah willed.
But if you consider it a conditional element, the verb of the
subordinate clause is }w ills}, while the verb of the main
clause is considered omitted, while the usage is: "W hat
Allah wills, shall be" as we are used to saying: "W hat Allah
wills, shall be, and what He wills not, it can never happen.”
What is intended is that you should have said, when you
entered your garden "That which Allah w ills" so that you
can make yourself free from attaching yourself to your
strength and might, and not be amazed by your garden.
❖

Concerning His statement: iT h ere is no strength but
with A llah}

La negates the type, and Quwwah is an unspecified noun
used in this context as a negation, to generalize. Quwwah
(strength) is an attribute with which one will be able to do
what he wants without any weakness.
If it is said: "W hat is the way of reconciliation between the
absolute negation of Quwwah except with Allah, and His
statement:
A*? ot

o*__ X ik -

4&\f>

iA llah is He Who created you in (a state of) weakness,
then gave you strength (Quwwah) after w eakn ess...}
(Ar-Rum 30:54)
And He said regarding 'Ad:

282

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4And they said: "Who is mightier than us in strength
(Quwwah)?" Do they not see, that Allah, Who created
them, is mightier than they in strength (Quwwah)?^
(Fussilat 41:15)
And He did not say that they did not have any strength, so
He affirmed a form of strength for man?”
The response is that the way to reconcile is from one of
two angles:
First: The Quwwah (strength) that the creation possesses is
from Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. If Allah had not given
him strength, he would not have any strength. So the
strength in humans is created by Allah, so there is no
strength in reality except by Allah.
Second: That what is meant by His saying: 4 There is no
strength} is "there is no perfect strength except with
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. "
In any case, this righteous man directed his companion to
detach himself from his ability and strength, and to
(instead) say that this is by the will of Allah and the
strength of Allah.
In this Ayah there is an affirmation of a Name out of Allah's
Names; and that is "Allah,” and, an affirmation of three
Attributes: Al-Uluhiyyah (divinity), Al-Quwwah (strength)
and Al-Mashiyy'ah (will).
And Allah's Mashiyy'ah (will) is His universal objective.
This is executed upon both what He loves, and what He
loves not, and it is executed upon all the servants without
any exception. It is compulsory that whatever He wills
comes to pass, in every condition. Whatever Allah wills, it
must happen, whether that relates to what He loves, and is
pleased with, or not.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

283

Concerning His statement: i l f Allah had willed, they
would not have fought with one another} The pronoun
here refers to the believers and disbelievers, due to
His, the Exalted, statement:

iB u t they did disagree. O f them were some who
believed, and o f them were some who disbelieved. And if
Allah had so willed, they would not have fought with
one another} (Al-Baqarah 2:253).
In this is a clear refutation against the Qadariyyah, those
who reject the link of man's actions to the will of Allah;
because Allah, the Exalted, says: $And if Allah had so
willed, they would not have fought with one another}
meaning; but He willed that they fight one another, so
they fought one another. He then said: } . . . But Allah does
what He wants} That is, he does that which He wants,
and Al-Iradah (want, objective, volition) here is the
universal Iradah (want, objective, volition).
And His saying: }d oes what He w ants}; the action, with
regard to what He, Glorious and Exalted is He, directly
does Himself. But with respect to what He decreed upon
His servants, it an action that is not directly (attributed
to Him). Because it is known that when a person fasts,
performs Salah, pays Zakah, performs Hajj, and performs
Jihad, the doer, without a doubt, is the person. It is also
known that this action of his is with Allah's volition.
It is not correct to attribute the action of man to Allah
directly, because the one who directly performs the action
is man, but it is correct to attribute it to Allah, meaning
from the view of the decree and creation.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

285

He iH would say: "Allah has made unlawful for you." Like
that, he would relate that it was made unlawful. He
sometimes made something unlawful and attributed it to
himself, but it was with the permission of Allah.
❖

}T h e beasts o f cattle}: They are the camels, cows,
sheep and goats.

❖

And His statement: iB ea sts} (Bahimah); named as
such because they do not speak.

❖

} except that which will be announced to you }: Except
that which is announced to you in this Surah, and
they are mentioned in His saying:

} Forbidden to you are Al-Maitah (deceased animals),
blood, the flesh o f swine, and that upon which other
than Allah's Name has been m entioned} (Al-Ma'idah
5:3).
In the exception here, there are some which are separate
(from the permissible category mentioned earlier) while
some are connected. As for the deceased animals among
the beasts of cattle, it is connected (to what preceded), but
with regard to the flesh of swine, it is separate, because it is
not among the beasts of cattle.
❖

Concerning his statement: }except that you should not
hold game to be lawful} ; meaning killing while in
Ihram; because he who does something, he becomes
just as one who makes it lawful, }g a m e } is a wild,
land animal that is consumable. This is the game that
is prohibited during Ihram.

❖

And His statement: fV erily , Allah judges as He
w an ts.} This is the Shari'ah type of Iradah (want,
objective, volition), because the context is that of

286

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

legislating. And it is possible for the Sharfah type of
Iradah also to be of the universal type. So we consider
the judgment (mentioned in the Ayah) to apply to
universal and Shari'ah judgments; so whatever He
wants to happen, He judged that and made it
happen, and whatever He wants to legislate, He
judged that and legislated it for His slaves.
From Allah's Names mentioned in this Ayah: "A llah," and
of the Attributes are: making lawful, judgment, and AlIradah (want, objective, volition).
The fourth Ayah: His statement:

4So, whomsoever Allah wants to guide, He expands his
chest fo r Islam ; and whomsoever He wants that he
should go astray, He makes his chest narrow and closed,
as though he was climbing up to the sky'fy (Al-An'am
6:125)

❖

Concerning His statement: i f i e expands his chest fo r
Islamy, what is meant by "w ants" here is the
universal Iradah (want, objective, volition), and by the
guidance; the guidance to do what is correct. You
therefore find such a person's chest expanded to
accept the laws and rites of Islam. He does them
with joy, happiness and hastens to them.

So if you realize this in your own soul, then know that
Allah wants good for you, and He wants guidance for you.
As for the one whose chest becomes tight - and we seek
refuge with Allah - this is a sign that Allah does not want
guidance for him, or else his breast would have been
expanded.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

287

That is why you find that the Salah, which is the heaviest
thing upon the hypocrites, is soothing to the eyes of the
sincere. The Prophet
said: "W om en and perfume have
been made dear to me from your worldly matters, and the
Salah has been made comforting for my eyes."[1]
There is no doubt that the Prophet
is the most perfect of
all people in faith, so his breast was opened for the Salah,
and it became a comfort to his eyes.
If it is said to a person; "It is obligatory upon you to
perform your Salah in congregation in the Masjid" and he
feels happy and says: "A ll praise is due to Allah, who has
legislated that for me, had Allah not legislated it, it would
have been an act of innovation'' and promptly proceeds to
it, and is pleased with it; this is a sign that Allah wants him
to be guided and that He wants good for him.
❖

He said: }H e opens his chest to Islam} ; 4 He opens}
(Yashrah) meaning; expands, and from this, is the
statement of Musa, peace be upon him, when Allah
sent him to Fir'awn:

}H e said: "My Lord! Open for me my chest."} (Ta Ha
20:25).
Meaning, expand my chest for me for addressing this man
and calling him (to You) because Fir'awn was tyranical and
obstinate.

111

Reported by Ahmad (3:128), An-Nasai' (7:61) and AlHakim (2:160), and he said it was Sahih, and Abu Ya'la
(6:199), from Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, and in
At-Talldus (3:134), Al-Hafiz said the version of An-Nasa'i
was Hasan.

288

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

❖

And His statement: $to Islamfy; this is general,
applying to the fundamentals of Islam, its subsidi­
aries, and what is obligatory in it. The more one's
chest has expanded for Islam and its legislative
decrees, then it is an indication that Allah wants
guidance for him.

❖

And concerning His statement: 4 and whomsoever He
wants that he should go astray, He makes his chest
narrow and closed, as though he was climbing up to the
skyfy (Al-An'am 6:125) Whoever He wants to send
astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted,
that is, severely tight. He then gave an example of
that, in His statement: 4As though he was climbing up
to the sky$ Meaning, as if when Islam was presented
to him, he feels as if he has been burdened by
climbing up to the sky. For this reason, the Ayah
came with: 4he was climbing upfy and did not say:
"ascending;" for it is as if he has been burdened with
severe hardship by the climb. And for the one who
feels burdened by the climb, there is no doubt that
he will grow weary and be bored.

Let us assume that it was sought from this man to climb a
very high and difficult-to-climb mountain. As soon as he
begins climbing the mountain, he becomes very stressed,
and soon feels very restricted, because he finds great
difficulty in that. Based on what the later people say today,
they say that he who ascends the skies, as he rises and
increases in height (above the earh) the more stress he feels
and the more he becomes constricted and feels the
pressure.
So, whether it is the first or the second meaning, this man to
whom Islam is presented - and Allah wanted him to go
astray - he finds a tightness in his chest, and feels harm, as

if he is climbing up to the sky with great difficulty.
From this noble Ayah, we derive the affirmation of Iradah
(want, objective, volition) for Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime. And the Iradah that is mentioned here is the
universal Iradah, not other than that, because He says:
4 Whomsoever Allah wants to guide4, 4And whomsoever He
wants to send astray4 This classification cannot be except
in universal matters.
As for the Shari'ah, Allah wants everyone to surrender to
the legislation of Allah.
From the matters of morals and worship (contained in this
Ayah is); it is obligatory upon a person to accept Islam

completely; its fundamentals and its subsidiaries, and
whatever is related to the rights of Allah and the rights
of the worshippers, and that it is obligatory for him to open
his chest to that. If he is not like that, he is therefore of the
second category, those whom Allah wants to send astray.
The Prophet ^ said: "W hoever Allah wants good for, He
gives him understanding of the religion."[1]
And understanding of the religion demands acceptance of
it, because every person who understands and knows the
religion, he accepts it, and loves it. He, the Exalted, said:

4But no, by your Lord, they have not believed, until
they make you judge in all disputes between them, and
find in themselves no resistance against your decisions,
and accpet with full submission4 (An-Nisd' 4:65).

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

So this form of swearing stresses - by use of the statement
<$No!$, and swearing particularly by the Rububiyyah of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, over His slaves, and it is
the mention of Allah's Rububiyyah over His Messenger it stresses the negation of faith from whoever does not
abide by these three matters:
The First: Judgement of the Messenger 3^ , based on His
saying: iuntil they make you judge in all disputes between
them$ meaning (by you), the Messenger gfc.
Whoever seeks judgement from other than Allah and His
Messenger, he is not a believer. He is either a disbeliever
whose disbelief has brought him out of the religion, or a
disbeliever whose disbelief is less than that.
The Second: The chest being open to the judgement; such
way that they do not find any resistance in themselves for
his decision. They rather find acceptance and openness to
what the Prophet j l j decided.
The Third: That they submit, which is stressesd; meaning
with complete submission.
So beware O Muslim! Of negating faith from yourself. Let
us draw an example for this: Two men were arguing about
the Shan ah ruling on an issue. One of them brought
evidence from the Sunnah, while the other found difficulty
and felt constricted by that. How could he abandon who he
follows, so as to follow this Sunnah? This man, without a
doubt, has defecient faith, because the believer, in truth, is
he who, when he has a text from the Book of Allah and the
Sunnah of His Messenger j||, he feels as if he has won the
greatest of spoils, and he will be joyful for that, and say:
"A ll praise is due to Allah who guided me to this." But soand-so, who is partisian to his opinion, and tries to turn the
textual proofs upside down, so that he can make them
agree with what he likes, not what Allah and His

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

Messenger intended, then this one is in a tremendous state
of danger.
The Categories of Al-Iradah
Al-Iradah is divided into two categories:
The first category: Universal Iradah. This kind of Iradah is
completely synonymous to Al-Mashiyy’ah (will). Therefore,
"H e w ants" has the meaning of "H e w ills." And this Iradah:
Firstly, relates to what Allah loves and what He does not
love.
Based upon this, if somebody says: "Does Allah want
disbelief?" Say: "In terms of the universal Iradah, then yes,
He wants that (to occur), and if Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, dod not want it (to occur) it would not occur.
Secondly, it necessarily occurs according to what was
wanted; meaning that what Allah wanted, then there is no
doubt that it will occur, and it is not possible that this be
opposed.
The Second category: The Shan ah type of Iradah, and it is
synonymous to love. So "H e w ants" in this case, has the
meaning of "H e loves". It is:
Firstly, specific to what Allah loves. So Allah does not want
disbelief and rebelliousness according to the Shari'ah type
of Iradah.
Secondly, it is not necessary that what was wanted occur,
meaning, that Allah, might want something, but it does not
occur. So He, Glorious is He, wants His creatures to
worship Him, and He did not necessitate that this want
occurred; they may worship Him, and they may not
worship Him, contrary to the universal Iradah.
T h erefore, th e d ifferen ce b etw een th e tw o categ o ries o f

Iradah is two angles:
1.

2.

The universal Iradah, in which it is necessary that what
was wanted occurs, and the S harf ah type in which it is
not necessary.
The Shan ah type of Iradah is specific to what Allah
loves, and the universal type is general, covering what
He loves and what He does not love.

If somebody says: "H ow is that Allah, the Exalted, wants
that what He does not love exist?” Meaning, how is that He
wants disbelief, or rebelliousness, or disobedience to occur,
while He does not love that?
The answer is that this is beloved to Allah from one
perspective, and disliked to Him from another perspective.
It is beloved to Him for the tremendous benefits in it, and
disliked to Him because it is disobedience.
And there is no reason that something can not be beloved
and disliked according to different perspectives.
Here is a man who gives his child - who is the delight and
fruit of his heart and mind - to a doctor to operate on him in
order to remove something harmful inside him. Now if
some person came and tried to tear him open with his
fingernails, rather than a scalpel, he would fight him. But
he is the one who took him to the doctor to cut him open,
while he is looking at him, and he is joyous and happy. He
takes his child to the doctor so that he (the doctor) can heat
the iron with fire until it glows red, and then he takes it (the
iron) and cauterizes his child with it, while he (the father) is
pleased with that. Why is he pleased with that, despite the
fact that it is painful for the child? Because what he wants is
other than that; a tremendous benefit which results from
that.
Our recognition of Al-Iradah benefits us from the behavioral

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

293

perspective in two matters:
The first matter: We will hang our hopes, fear and all our
circumstances and deeds upon Allah, because everything is
according to his Iradah, and this is our realization of
Tawakkul.
The second matter: We will do what Allah wants according
to the S harf ah. So when we know that this is what Allah
wants, from the Sharfah type of Iradah, and it is beloved to
him, that will strengthen our determination to do it.
These are some of the behavioral benefits of our recognition
of the Iradah.
The first is in accord with the universal Iradah, and the
second is in accord with the S h arf ah type of Iradah.

❖

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4Do Ilisting- (Ahsanu) it is a verb of command. AlIhsan can be obligatory, and it can be recommended;
w hatever is necessary for the fulfillm ent of an
obligation, then it is obligatory, and whatever is
additional to that is recommended. Based upon that,
we say: 4Do Ihsdnfy (Ahsanii) is a verb of command
that is used for what is obligatory and what is
recommended.

Al-Ihsan can be in worship of Allah, and can be in dealing
with creatures. The Prophet
explained Al-Ihsan in
worshipping Allah, when Jibril asked him ,[1] saying:
"W hat is Al-Ihsan?" He said: "That you worship Allah as
though you see H im ." This is more complete than what is
lower (in rank), because he who worships Allah as if he
saw Him, he worships Him seeking and hoping in Him.
"For while you do not see Him, He indeed sees you." That
is, if you never reach this state, know that He indeed sees
you. And the one that worships Allah in this manner, he
worships Him in the state of fear and flight (from His
prohibitions), because He is afraid of the One Who is
looking at him.
As for Al-Ihsan in relation to dealing with creatures, then it
is said regarding its explanation, that it is generosity, and
refraining from harming others, and having a cheerful face.
Generosity: That is beneficence, whether with wealth,
physically, or one's position.
Refraining from harming others: That is, you should not
harm people with your speech and actions.
Having a cheeful face: That you should not frown at

295

people. But a man can sometimes be angry and frown; so
we say that there is cause for this. It can be considered from
Al-Ihsan when there is a cause to rectify the situation. That
is why if we stone an adulterer or whip a fornicator, it is an
act of Ihsan towards him.
Ihsan when dealing in business, and selling, renting, and
marriage, and other that is included here. Because if you
deal well with people in these matters, you become patient
with difficulty, and quickly fulfill the rights (of people).
This is a kind of generosity. If you transgress by cheating,
lying, and making false claims, then you have refrained
from harming others, because these are harms.
So have Ihsan in worshipping Allah and toward the slaves
of Allah.
❖

Concerning His statement: } Surely Allah loves the
Muhsinin} , this is the reasoning for the command, so
this is the reward for the one who does Ihsan-, that
Allah loves him. And Allah's love is of tremendous
exalted status. And by Allah! Indeed Allah's love is
to be bought by the entire world, and it is more
important than you loving Allah. So Allah loving
you is higher than you loving Allah, that is why He,
the Exalted said:

}S a y : "If you indeed love Allah, then follow me; Allah
will love y o u ..." } (Al 'Imran 3:31).
He did not say: "Then follow me, and you shall be
considered sincere in your love of Allah," even though the
case is like that, but He said: } Allah will love y o u.} That is
why some scholars say: "W hat is imporant is that Allah
loves you, not that you love H im ."

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Everyone claims that he loves Allah, but the issue is, does
the One above the heavens, the Mighty and Sublime, love
you or not? If Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, loves you,
the Angels in the heaven will love you, then you will be
granted acceptance on the e a r t h , T h e n the people of the
earth will accept you, and accept what comes from you.

Based on what is reported by Al-Bukhari (3209), Muslim
(2637) from Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him,
from the Prophet Si who said: "When Allah loves a
servant, He calls Jibril: 'Allah loves so-and so,' so Jibril
loves him, and Jibril calls out to inhabitants of the heavens:
'Allah loves so-and so, so love him' and acceptance is

^ecjuitablefy That is, be just and this is obligatory.
Being just is obligatory in all matters where equality
is compulsory. Included in that is is justice in dealing
with Allah, the Mighty and Sublime; Allah grants
you favors, thus, from justice is that you abide with
gratitude to Him. Allah clarifies the truth to you; so
from justice is that you follow this truth.

And dealing with the creatures is included in that: That you
deal with people in a way that you would like for them to
deal with you. That is why the Prophet #§ said: "W hoever
likes to be delivered from the Fire, and to be admitted into
Paradise, he should believe in Allah and the Last Day at the
time when his death takes him, and he should deal with
people in the manner that he likes to be dealt w ith ."111
Deal with people in the manner that you would like them
to deal with you. For example: If you want to deal with
someone, first consider that for yourself. If somebody deals
with you that way, would you be pleased or not? If you
will be pleased, then deal with them that way, or else, do
not deal with them that way.
Justice among children, in what you give them, also enters
into that. The Prophet
said: "H ave Taqwa of Allah and be
just among your children."[2]
Justice among heirs in inheritance is included in that. Each
of them should be given his share, and nothing should be
bequeathed to any of them through a will.
Justice among the wives is included in that; you should

allot for each of them what you allot for the other.
Justice with yourself is included in that, so do not overburden
yourself with any deed beyond your capability. Your Lord
has a right upon you, and your body has a right upon you.
Measure (other things) based on this.
Here it is compusory that we call our attention to the fact
that some people used the word "equality” instead of
justice! This is a mistake. Equality should not be said,
because equality can demand equalization between two
things when the judgement demands a distinction between
them. Because of this oppressive call to equality, they began
to say: "W hat is the difference between a male and a female?
The male and female are equal!” Such that the communists
said: "W hat is the difference between the leader and the
subject? It is not possible that anyone have power over
another, even between the father and the child. The father
does not have power over the child...” and so on!
But when we say justice, it is giving everybody what he is
entitled to; this danger disappears. And the expression
becomes faultless.
That is why "Verily, Allah commands Taswiyah (equality)”
never occurs in the Qur'an! But:

iV erily, Allah commands justice^ (An-Nahl 16:90)

4 And that, when you judge between the people, you
judge with justice^ (An-Nisa 5:58).
He is mistaken about Islam, whoever says: "The religion of
Islam is a religion of equality!” Rather, the religion of Islam
is the religion of justice, and that combines between two

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

299

equals and separates between two distinctions. Otherwise,
if a person intends "ju stice" when using the word
"equality," then he will then be considered correct in the
meaning, but mistaken in the expression. This is why most
of what is related in the Qur'an (in this matter) is a negation
of equality.

} S a y : "Are those who know equal to those who know
n ot?"} (Az-Zumar 39:9)

} S a y : "Can the blind and the seeing be equal? Or can
darkness be equal to light?"} (Ar-Ra'd 13:16)

}N ot equal among you are those who spent and fought
before the Conquest. Such are higher in degree than those
who spent and fought afterw ards} (Al-Hadid 57:10).

}N ot equal are those o f the believers who sit (at home),
except those who are disabled, and those who strive hard
in the Cause o f A llah} (An-Nisa' 4:95).
Not a single word was ever related in the Q ur'an
commanding equality, only justice was commanded. And
you find that the word "justice" is more acceptable to the
souls. I like to call our attention to this, so as to avoid it in
our talks, because some people understand the statement
according to its face-value, and will not ponder what it
indicates, nor why it is used and its significance to the one

That is, as long as those with a covenant (Al-Mu'ahidun),
concluded with you in Al-Masjid Al-Haram, are true in
fulfilling the covenant, you should stand true to them in
that. This conditional clause, by its express meaning, states
that if they are true to us, it is compulsory that we stand
true to them, and that we fulfill our part of the covenant
with them. It's understanding also indicates that if they are

301

not true, we should not stand true to them.
Al-Mu'ahidun are divided into three categories:
The category of those that are true in their covenant and
oaths, it is therefore obligatory upon us to stand true to
them, because of His, the Exalted, statement:

$So, long as they are true to you (Istaqamu), stand you
true to them. Verily, Allah He loves A l-M uttaqm ) (AtTawbah 9:7)
The category of those who betray and nullify their
covenant; so there is no covenant with these people (after
that), based upon His, the Exalted, saying:

)B u t if they violate their oath after their covenant, and
attack your religion with disapproval and criticism, then
fight the leaders o f disbelief, fo r surely their oaths are
nothing to th e m ...) (At-Tawbah 9:12)
The third group manifests that they are being true to us,
but we fear betrayal on their part. Meaning that you find
some causes indicating that they want to be treacherous. So
these people, Allah said about them:

) I f you fear treachery from any people, then renounce
(their covenant) to them (so as to be) on equal terms.
Certainly Allah likes not the treacherous) (Al-Anfal 8:58).
Meaning, renounce the covenant with them, so say "There

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

302

is no covenant between us and you." If somebody says:
"W hy do we renounce the covenant with them, while they
are Mu'ahidun?"
We reply that it is due to the fear of them being treacherous,
so we do not trust these people, because it is possible that
they will attack us one day. So for these, we treat them with
the same. We will not betray them as long as the covenant is
upheld, because if the Muslims say: "W e fear the treachery
of these these people, so we will (therefore) hasten to fight
them," We say this is prohibited. Do not fight them until
you have renounced the covenant with them.

Mutatahhinri} (Al-Baqarah 2:222)
❖

At-Tawwab is an excessive form of At-Tawbah (repen­
tance), and he (the Tawwab) is the one who often
returns to Allah. And At-Tawbah (repentance) is to
return to Allah, from disobedience to obedience.

Its conditions are five:
The first: Al-Ikhlas (Sincerity of intention) towards Allah,
the Exalted, such that it is this which carries him in
repentance fearing Allah, and hoping in His reward.
The second: Regret for the sin he committed. And the sign
of that is that he wishes that it never came from him.
The third: Abstention from the sin; by leaving it if it was an
unlawful act, or by fulfilling it if it was an obligation that is
(still) possible to fulfill.
The fourth: The determination to not return to it.
The fifth: That it be during the time in which repentance is
acceptable. That is, before the coming of death (to him), and
the rising of the sun from where it sets. If it is at death, or
after the rising of the sun from where it sets, it will not be
accepted.
Thus At-Tawwab refers to the one who often repents. What
is known is that repenting often implies having sinned
often. From here we understand that no matter how
numerous the sins of a person are, as long as he repents for
each sin, Allah, the Exalted, loves him. And therefore, one
who repented one time from one sin, then he is more
worthy of being loved by Allah, the Mighty and Sublime;
because Allah loves the one whose sins are numerous when
his acts of repentance are numerous, so he whose sins are
few; then with his repentance, he is more worthy of Allah's
love.

who claim to love Allah, to say to them: "If you are
sincere in loving Allah, follow the Messenger/'
So whoever initiates something new in the religion of the
Messenger of Allah, and said: "I love Allah and His
Messenger by what I innovated." We say to him: "This is a
lie. If your love is sincere, then you would follow the
Messenger
and you would not put yourself before him
by introducing what is not from his religion into his
S harf ah. Everyone who follows the Messenger of Allah
most, then he is the most beloved to Allah.
If he loves Allah and esablishes His worship, Allah, the
Exalted, loves him. Rather, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
will give him more than his own works. Allah, the Exalted,
said - in the Hadith Qudsi: "H e who remembers Me to
himself, I remember him to M yself." And Allah's Self is
more magnificent than our selves; "And he who remem­
bers Me in an assembly, I remember him in an assembly
better than it." And also in the Hadith, whoever draws near
to Him by a hand-span, He draws nearer to him by a
forearm's length, and he who draws nearer to Him by a
forearm's length, He draws nearer to him open arm's
length. He who draws nearer to Allah walking, Allah
approaches him quickly."
Therefore, what Allah, the Mighty and Sublime gives, and
His reward, is greater than your own works.

truth, even if it is against themselves. But they
employ wisdom in this Jihad; and they aspire to
achieve the goal. If they see that the Da'wah demands
some delay in some matters, they delay. If they see
that doing Da'wah demands leniency in some situa­
tions, they use it, because they want to reach a
particular goal, and the m eans (em ployed) are
according to what the situation demands.

This Ayah is from Surat As-Saff, which in reality is the
Surah of Al-Jihad, because Allah, the Exalted, begins it
with praise for those who fight in His Cause, then He
calls to Jihad at the end of it. Then, between that, He
mentions that Allah will make His religion dominant
over all other religions, even though the polytheists
detest that.

4 Verily, Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in
ranks}: no one advances ahead of others, nor lags
behind, even in Jihad.

The Salah is a minor Jihad, in it is a leader whose following
is compulsory, if you do not follow him, your Salah
becomes invalid. The Prophet 5f| said: "D oes he who raises
his head before the Imam not fear that Allah will change his
head into the head of a donkey, or make his appearance

into the appearance of a donkey?"'1' And the rows in the
Salah are like the ranks in Jihad. The Messenger
would
arrange them for Jihad as he would arrange them for Salah.
}A s if they were a structure} , and a structure, as said by
the Messenger #|, "...each part supports the other."12'
Each part clings to the other, and as such, He said: $as if
they were a structure, consolidated.} It is not like being
separated; So Al-Marsus is firm, clinging together.
These people, whom Allah attaches love to because of their
deeds, have a number of qualities.
Firstly: They fight, so they do not lean on residing,
indifference, indolence and inactivity which weakens
matters of the religion and the worldy life.
Secondly: Al-Ikjflas (Sincerity of intent) based on His saying
$in His Cause}
Thirdly: One supports the other, based on His saying: }in
rows}.
Fourthly: That they are like a building, and a building is an
invulnerable fortress.
Fifthly: Whatever tears at them, it cannot penetrate into
them, based on His word consolidated}.
Allah attaches love to these people based on these five
qualities.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

I wish that the author had added a ninth Ayah regarding
the love, and that about Al-Khullah, due to His saying:

^And Allah took Ibrahim as a K halilj (An-Nisa 4:125).
Al-Khalil is he who is at the highest rank of love. So AlKhullah, is the highest kind of love; because Al-Khalil is the
one whose love reaches to the inner most depths of the
heart and permeates passages of its veins. No type of love
is ever above Al-Khullah. Describing his beloved, one poet
said:
You have indeed permeated the passage o f the soul in me.
And with this the Khalil is named a Khalil.
The Prophet ^ loved all his Companions, but he never
took any of them as a Khalil. While addressing the people,
the Prophet
said: " 'If I were to have taken anyone from
my Ummah as a Khalil, I would have chosen Abu
Bakr.,,,[1]
Therefore Abu Bakr is the most beloved of all people to
him, but his love did not reach the status of Al-Khullah,
because he did not take anyone as his Khalil, but there was
the brotherhood of Islam, and its love.
But in the case of Al-Khullah, that was between him and his
Lord. The Prophet
said: "Indeed Allah has taken me as a
Khalil just as He took Ibrahim as a Khalil."^
We do not know of Al-Khullah being affirmed for any
human aside from these two people. They are Ibrahim and
Muhammad, may the Salah and Salam be upon them both,

based upon the saying of the Prophet
"Indeed Allah has
taken me as a Khalil just as He took Ibrahim as a Khalil."
And this Khullah is an Attribute among the Attributes of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, because it is the highest
type of love, and its status is Tawqifiyyah - it is not possible
to affirm that anyone among the human beings is a Khalil
except with an evidence, not even among the Prophets,
may the Salah and Salam be upon them, except these two
honorable Messengers; for these two are the Khalils of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
This Ayah: $And Allah took Ibrahim as a K h a l i l is the
evidence cited by the one who executed Al-Ja'd bn
Dirham, the head of the denying Jahmiyyah; the first thing
he denied was when he said: "Allah never took Ibrahim

people of Al-'Iraq for Hisham, and before that, he was the
governor of Makkah for Al-Walid bin 'Abdul-Malik, the
for Sulaiman. He was generous, praiseworthy and of a
high rank among the nobles, but there were some issues of
Nasib that were well-known from him. 'Abdullah bin
Ahmad bin Hanbal said: "I heard Ibn Ma'In saying:
'Khalid bin 'Abdullah Al-Qasri, an evil person who
disparaged 'All." See As-Siyar (5:425-432)

did not take Ibrahim as a K/w/fZ, and He never Spoke to

him.[1]
Ibn Al-Qayyim said about that:^

Since he said that Ibrahim was not His Khalil
And Musa was not the close speaker
Everyone who upholds the Sunnah was grateful for the
sacrifice,
Good of you for the sacrifice
Now we have Mahabbah (love), Wadd (love), and Khullah. So
Al-Mahabbah and Al-Wadd are general, and Al-Khullah is
specific to Ibrahim and Muhammad.
It is obligatory upon us, when it comes to matters of the
unseen, to rely upon revealed texts as evidence. But this
does not prevent us from using intellectual proofs to
convince those who reject the idea that Al-Mahabbah is
affirmed by intellectual evidence; like the Ash'ariyyah, they
say it is never possible that Al-Mahabbah be affirmed
between Allah and the worshipper. Because the intellect
does not prove that. And all of what is not proven by the
intellect, then it is obligatory to declare Allah's innocence of
it.

It was mentioned by Al-Bukhari inKhalqu A f al Al-'Ibad (no.
12), and Ad-DarimI in Ar-Rad 'alal-Jahmiyyah (17). AlAlban! said its chain is strong in M ukhtasar Al-'Ulu (135).

explanation of Ibn 'Isa (1:50).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

315

So we say: We affirm Al-Mahabbah based upon intellectual
evidences; just as it is affirmed, according to us, by
evidences in revealed texts. To argue against whoever
rejects that it is affirmed by the intellect, then we say - and
with Allah is the facilitation to do what is correct:
In the award of Paradise, aid, support, and other than that,
for those who are obedient, there is evidence without a
doubt for Al-M ahabbah. We witness with our own eyes, and
hear with our own ears about those who have preceded,
and those to come, that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
supports whomever He supports among His believing
servants, and He aided them and rewarded them. Is this
anything other than evidence of Al-Mahabbah for those He
supported, aided and rewarded?
There are two questions here.
The First. How does a person attain the love of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime? This is what every person craves for.
Love is a natural matter, that a person possesses and
cannot control it. That is why it is seen that the Messenger
#1 said about justice among his wives: "This is my division
regarding what I control, so do not blame me regarding
that which I do not control.''111
The Reply: There are many means that lead to Al-Mahabbah
Among them is that a person consider who created him,
and who is it that has been providing him with various

favours since he was in his mother's womb? And who is it
that caused the blood to flow into your veins before you
were placed on the earth, except Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime? Who is it that prevents the various harms from
befalling you after all the causes of the harms have been
set? Many a time you yourself witnessed dangers and
harms that almost befell you when Allah would remove
them from you.
There is no doubt that this will bring about love. That is
why it is related in a Hadith: "Love Allah for what He
nourishes you with of His favours."111 I think that if
someone gives you a pen, you will like him. If that is so,
look at all the favours Allah has granted you, they are so
numerous that they cannot be counted; you will love Allah.
That is why when a favour comes to you while you are in
great need, you find your chest expanded, and you love the
one who offered you the favour, and this is different than
constant favors; so you must remember these favours that
Allah gives you, and also remember that Allah favours you
above many of his believing servants.
If Allah grants you knowledge, He has favoured you with
knowledge; or with worship, He has favoured you with
worship; or with wealth, He has favoured you with wealth,
or with family, He has favoured you with family; or with
food, He has favoured you with food. There is no favour
except there is one lower in rank in it. If you recognize this
great favour, you will be grateful to Allah and love Him.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

317

Among them, it is to love what Allah loves of actions, the
verbal, the physical, and those of the heart. Love that which
Allah loves, this will make you love Allah, because Allah
will reward you for this, by putting His love in your heart.
You will love Allah if you do what He loves, and in the
same way, you love whom He loves. The difference
between them is clear. The latter has to do with people,
while the former has to do with actions, because "w hat” is
used for non-human beings in terms of action, places and
times, and "w ho” is used for human beings. If you love the
Prophet #§; love Ibrahim, love Musa, 'Isa and others among
the Prophets, if you love the truthful ones, such as Abu
Bakr, the martyrs, and others whom Allah loves, this brings
about Allah love. This is also among the effects of Allah's
love. It is a cause and an effect.
Among them, is frequent remembrance of Allah, such that
it is always on your mind, until you are such that everytime
you witness anything, it makes you think of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, such that your heart will always be
busy with Allah, turning away from all other than Him.
This will bring about the love of Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime.
These three factors, in my view, are of the most powerful
causes for Allah's love.
The second question: W hat are the behavioural effects
implied from what He mentioned?
The Response:
Firstly: His saying:

44

oi

4 And do Ihsan; surely Allah loves the M uhsim n .4 (AlBaqarah 2 :195)

318

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wdsitiyyah

— dictates that we do Ihsan; and that we crave doing Ihsan,
because Allah loves it, and everything which Allah loves,
we should crave it.
Secondly: His saying

4.And be equitable. Verily, Allah loves those who are
equitable.$ (Al-Hujurat 49:9)
— dicates that we are just, and that we crave justice.
Thirdly: His saying:

4 Verily, Allah loves A l-M u ttaqin(A t-T axvbah 9:7)
— dicates that we should have Taqwa of Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime. We should not fear the creatures in such a
way that, if someone we are shy of among the people is
with us, we leave an act of disobedience, but when he is
not, we commit the act of disobedience. So Taqwa is that we
have Taqwa of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and not
worry about the people. Rectify what is between you and
Allah, and Allah will rectify that is between you and the
people.
O my brother, consider what is between you and your
Lord, and do not worry about other than that;

4Truly, Allah defends those who believe} (Al-Hajj 22:38)
Do what is determined by the Shan1ah, and the end shall be

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

319

Fourthly: Allah, the Exalted, says:
4-4.
^Verily, Allah loves At-Tawwdbin...} (Al-Baqarah 2:222)
This demands that I frequently turn in repentance to Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime. I should frequently return to
Allah with my heart and my form. A person merely saying:
"I turn in repentance to Allah” will not really benefit, but
be mindful, and say: "I turn in repentance to Allah” while
there is an act of disobedience before you, return to Allah
from it, and repent so that you can gain the love of Allah.

ia n d He loves Al-M utatahhirin.} (Al-Baqarah 2:222)
When you wash filth from your garment, you should sense
that Allah loves you, because He loves those who purify
themselves. If you perform Wudu', you should sense that
Allah loves you, because you have purified yourself. If you
peform Ghusl, you should sense that Allah loves you,
because Allah loves those who purify themselves.
By Allah we are heedless of these meanings; most of the
time we just perform purification from filth or ritual
impurity, because it is a condition for the correctness of the
Salah, and we do it out of fear of invalidating our Salah. But,
so often we fail to realize that this act, is a means of
drawing nearer to Allah, and a means of Allah's love for us.
If we were mindful whenever someone washes a drop of
urine from his garment, that this act will bring about
Allah's love for him, we would obtain so much goodness;
but we are heedless.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

320

Fifthly: His saying:

i l f you indeed love Allah, then follow me, Allah will
love you and forgive you your sins A (Al 'Imran 3:31).
This also demands that we have the utmost desire to follow
the Prophet xg, such that we completely follow his path, we
do not exit from it, nor fall short in it, nor add to it, nor
decrease from it.
Keeping all of this in mind will protect us from innova­
tions, and it will protect us from neglect, and it will protect
us from additions and extremism. If we are mindful of
these matters, the how would our behavior, our manners,
our character, and our worship be?
Sixthly: His statement:

back from his religion, Allah will bring a people whom
He will love and they will love Him4 (Al-Ma’idah 5:54)
Due to this, we are very careful from turning back from
Islam, among which is the abandonment of the Salah
prayer. When we know that Allah is threatening us that if
we turn back from our religion, He will destroy us, and
bring a people whom He will love, and they will love Him;
and they will fulfill their obligations to their Lord, we will
adhere to obeying Allah and avoiding everything that
draws close to apostasy.

Commentary On The Introductory Notes.

321

Seventhly, His saying:

^ Verily, Allah loves those who fight in His Cause in
ranks, as if they were a structure, consolidated(AsSaffeVA)
When we believe in this Attribute of love, we will do these
five things which it demands and requires: Fighting, not
being negligent, sincerity, being in the Cause of Allah, one
of us supporting the other as if we were a building; to
consolidate the tie among us like a solid structure; that we
should be in rows. This demands equality of feeling so that
the hearts do not disagree with one another; this is among
that which strengthens affection. When a person sees
somebody on his right, and someone on his left, he feels
comfortable; if he is surrounded from all angles, then his
determination will strengthen.
Therefore, there are three discussions based on these Ayat.
1.
2.
3.

The affirmation of the attribute of love with evidence
from revealed texts
Its causes.
The behavioural effects of having faith in it.

As for the people of innovation those who deny it, they do
not have any proof except very baseless ones. They say:
Firstly: The intellect does not not prove that.
Secondly: That love can only exist between two similar
things, it can never exist between the Lord and the creature;
it can exist between the creatures.
We refute them by saying: We will responded to the first,
which is that the intellect does not prove that, with two

322

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

replies; one of them is through a submission, and the other
by a refusal.
As for the submission, we say we submit that the intellect
does not prove the attribute of love, but the revealed texts
establish that, and it is an independent fact on its own.
Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, says:

$And we have sent down to you the Book (the Quran)
as an exposition of everything^ (An-Nahl 16:89).
Since it is an exposition, then it is an evidence all by itself.
The lack of a particular proof does not necessarily mean the
absence of what is being proven; because there could be a
number of proofs for what is being proven, whether
sensory or abstract. As for the sensory; such as a city which
has a number of roads leading to it, if we miss a road, we
enter through the second road. As for the abstract; many a
ruling has a number of proofs. The obligation of purifica­
tion before the Salah, for example has many proofs.
Therefore, if you say that the intellect does not prove the
affirmation of love between the Creator and the creature,
the revealed texts prove it with the strongest of proofs and
the most evident exposition.
The second response: The refusal; that is we refuse the
claim that the intellect does not prove it. We say, rather the
intellect does prove the affirmation of love between the
Creator and the creature as preceded.
As for your saying that the love cannot exist between two
similar things, it is enough to say your claim is not
acceptable since the basic fact is that it is not established.
We say your claim that it cannot exist except between two
similar beings is impossible. Rather it exists between two

323

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

dissimilar beings. For example, somebody has an old watch
which never develops any fault nor stops functioning. You
will find him loving it. And supposing that he has another
which consumes half of his time repairing it. You will find
that he detests it. Also, you find that beasts love, and they
are loved.
So we, and all praise is due to Allah, affirm that there is
love between Allah and His servants.

And His saying: $ln the Name o f Allah, Ar-Rahmdn,
Ar-Rahim^ (An-Naml 27:30). $Our Lord! You

$In the Name o f Allah, Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahfm$ (AnNaml 27:30).

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

324

The author cited this Ayah to establish a ruling; it is not an
introduction to what comes after it. The commentary on the
Basmalah (the saying: In the Name of Allah, Ar-Rahman, ArRahim) preceded. Therefore, there is no need to repeat it.
In it are three of Allah's Names: Allah, Ar-Rahmdn, and ArRahim, and from his Attributes are: Al-Uluhiyyah (divinity)
and Ar-Rahmah (mercy).
The second Ayah:

}O u r Lord! You encompass all things in mercy and
knowledge} (Ghdfir 40:7)
This is the saying of the Angels:

iT hose (Angels) who bear the Throne, and those around
it, glorify the praises o f their Lord, and believe in Him
and ask fo r forgiveness fo r those who believe, sayin g:
"Our Lord! You encompass all things in mercy and
knowledge, so forgive those who repent and follow your
way, and save them from the torment o f the blazing
Fire!} (Ghdfir 40:7).
How magnificent faith is! And how magnificent are its
benefits! The Angels around the Throne who bear it, pray
to Allah for the believers.
❖

His statement: $Our Lord! You encompass all things in
mercy and knowledge} shows that everything that the
knowledge of Allah reaches — and it reaches all
things — then His mercy reaches it. For Allah

325

coupled them in the decree: }O u r Lord!

You

This is a general mercy that covers all the creatures even
the disbelievers, because Allah coupled this mercy with
knowledge. And everything which the knowledge of Allah
reaches - and the knowledge of Allah reaches all things then His mercy has reached it. So just as He knows the
disbeliever, He has mercy on the disbeliever as well.
However, the mercy for the disbeliever is physically,
bodily, worldly, and highly confined compared to the
mercy bestowed upon the believer. The one who provides
for the disbeliever is Allah; He is the One who provides
him with food, drink, clothing, shelter and a spouse, and
other than that.
As for the believers, their mercy is more special, and more
tremendous, because it is a mercy of faith, religion, as well
as worldly. That is why you find the believers better in
condition than the disbelievers, even in the matters of the
world, because Allah says:

4 Whoever works righteousness - whether male or

will give a good life!} (An-Nahl 16:97).
This good life is missing for the disbeliever. Their life is like
that of the beasts. When he is satiated, he defecates, but
when he does not get enough to eat, he sits down and
begins to shout. That is how these disbelievers are. When
they are full, they become pompous, or else they sit down
and begin to shout! They do not benefit from their life. But
as for the believer, if harm befalls him, he perseveres and
has hopes for reward from Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.

326

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

If (on the other hand), a good thing happens to him, he is
grateful, he is in goodness in this, and in that. And his heart
is open, tranquil, accepting the decree and the will (of
Allah). He is not anxious during a trial, nor arrogant when
favored with blessings; rather he is balanced, upright, and
moderate. This is the difference between the mercy for this
one and the mercy for that one.
But unfortunately O brothers, there are thousands of us
those who wish to surpass the caravans of the disbelievers
in the world, so much that they make this world their sole
target. If they are given, they become pleased. If they are
not given, then they become angry. These people, no matter
what they have of this worldly affluence, they are still in a
Hell. They never tasted the sweetness of this world. The
one who tastes the sweetness is he who believes in Allah
and does righteous deeds.
That is why one of the Salaf (pious predecessors) said: "By
Allah, if the kings or the princes knew what we experience
(of enjoyment), they would have fought us for it with the
swords, because what obstructed them from these favors is
the rebelliousness (against Allah), the disobedience (against
Allah), and reliance on the world, and that this is the
greatest of their concern and the extent of their knowl­
edge."
Among Allah's Attributes included in this Ayah are: ArRububiyyah (Lordship) and encompassing mercy and
knowledge.

do we harmonize between this Ayah, and the one
before it:

}O u r Lord! You encompass all things in mercy and
knowledge} (Ghafir 40:7)
We say: The mercy here is not the mercy there. This is a
specific mercy that has to do with the mercy of the
Hereafter, which the disbelievers cannot earn, unlike the
first one. This is the way of harmonizing between them. Or
else, mercy is for everyone, but there is a difference
between mercy that is specific and mercy that is general.

(Al-A'raf

He, Majestic is His Majesty, says, praising and glorifying
Himself: $And M y mercy encompasses all things} He
praised Himself, the Mighty and Sublime, in that His
mercy encompasses everything inhabiting the heavens
and the earth. We say here what we said about the
second Ayah; so refer to that.

The fifth Ayah:

iY o u r Lord has written Mercy fo r Himself^ (Al-An'dm
6:54).
❖

^Written)*-, meaning He prescribed Mercy for Himself.
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, in His magnanimity,
His grace, and His generosity, prescribed mercy for
Himself, and gave His Mercy precedence over His
wrath.

$And if Allah were to punish the people fo r that which
they earned, He would not leave a moving creature on
its (the earth's) surface^ (Fatir 35:45).
But His forbearance and mercy make Him leave the
creation to its appointed time.
And from His Mercy is what He mentioned in His saying:

4So that if any o f you does evil in ignorance, and
thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds, then
surely, He is Ghafurun Rahim (Oft-Forgiving, Most
Merciful)$ (Al-An'dm 6:54).
This is from His Mercy.
❖

4hvil4 is an indefinite noun related in the context of
condition, it therefore encompasses all evils, even
Shirk.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

❖

4hi ignorance)>: meaning out of foolishness. What is
intended by it here is not a lack of knowledge; but
foolishness is lack of wisdom, because everyone who
disobeys Allah has disobeyed Him out ignorance,
foolishness, and a lack of wisdom.

❖

4And thereafter repents and does righteous good deeds,
then surely, He is Ghafurun Rahim (Oft-Forgiving, Most
Merciful)$ He forgives his sin and has mercy with
him.

He did not end the Ayah with this, except for the reason
that the repenting sinner will earn forgiveness and mercy.
This is from His Mercy which He prescribed for Himself; if
not, justice would demand that He punish him for his sin,
and reward him for his righteous deeds.
If a man commits sins for fifty days, then he repents and
does righteous deeds for fifty days, then what is just is that
we give him the punishment for the fifty days, and the
reward for the fifty days of good deeds. But Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, prescribed Mercy upon Himself. All
of the fifty days of sins will be erased, and they will vanish
within a period of time. He added to that;

4 For those Allah will change their sins into good deedsfy
(Al-Furqan 25:70)
The previous sins will be converted into rewards for good
deeds, because every sin has been repented from, and
every act of repentance brings a reward. By this, the effect
of His statement becomes clear:

4Your Lord has written Mercy for Himseljf (Al-An'dm 6:54).

Among the Attributes of Allah included in this Ayah are: ArRububiyyah (Lordship), making matters obligatory, and mercy.

^And He is Al-Ghafur, Al-Rahim4 (Yunus 10:107).

The sixth Ayah:

$And He is Al-Ghafur, Al-Rahim4 (Yunus 10:107).
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is the Al-Ghafur, Ar-Rahim.
He, the Mighty and Sublime, combines between these two
Names, because the punishment for a sin is withdrawn due
to the pardon, and with mercy, the desire is achieved. And
a person is in need of both of these. He is in need of being
pardoned, to be saved from his sins, and he is in need of
mercy, by which he will be successful in the fulfillment of
his desire.
❖

4Al-Ghafur4 is a form indicating extensiveness,^
derived from Al-Ghafar (pardon) which is the cover,
with protection. Because it is derived from Al-Mighfar
(helmet). And a helmet is something which is put on
head while fighting to protect from an arrow. There
are the two benefits derived from this helmet, they
are that it shields the head and it brings protection.
Therefore, Al-Ghafur is He who covers up the sins of

(Translation note): See the Shaikh's explanation of "ArRahman” at the beginning of the text.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

His servants and protects them from the evil of their
sins, by pardoning them.
What is confirmed in the Sahih points to this: "Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, shall be alone with His servant on the
Day of Judgment, and make him acknowledge his sins,
saying: 'You did such-and-such; you did such-and-such'
until he admits that. Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will
then say to him. 'I have covered them up for you in the
world, and I pardon you for them to d a y .'"^
❖

As for 4Ar-Rahim)>; then He is the possessor of the
encompassing mercy, and the discussion about that
preceded.

And among the Names included in the Ayah are; Al-Ghafiir
and Ar-Rahim. And among the Attributes: Al-Maghrifah
(pardon), and Ar-Rahmah (mercy).

Based on the report of Al-Bukhari (2441), Muslim (2768)

"The Prophet
said: 'Allah shall bring the believer close,
and cover him with His Screen, and say, 'Do you realize
such-and-such sin?' 'Do you realize such-and-such sin?' He
will say, 'Yes, my Lord' until when he is made to
acknowledge his sins, and thinks he is destroyed, He will
say: 'I have concealed it for you in the world, and forgiven
you for it today.'"

The seventh Ayah:

4But Allah is the best to guard, and He is the Most
Merciful o f those who show m ercy} (Yusuf 12:64)
Ya'qub said this, when he sent the blood-brother of Yusuf
with his other sons, because Yusuf, may the Salah and Salam
be upon him, said: "You will not be granted measure when
you return, unless you bring your brother along with you."
They told their father of this message, and due to this
necessity; he sent him along with them, and said this
during his farewell. He said:

4Can I entrust him to you, except as I entrusted his
brother to you aforetime, but Allah is the best to guard,
and He is the Most Merciful o f those who show mercy4
(Yusuf 12:64.)
— meaning: You can never protect him, but Allah is the
one who will guard him.
❖

The evidence in the Ayah here, is His saying: }a n d He is
the Most Merciful o f those who show mercy^ because it
affirms Mercy for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
Rather, He clarified that He is the Most Merciful of
those who show mercy. If the mercy of all creatures
was gathered together, the Mercy of Allah will be
stronger and greater. The greatest mercy a creature
would show another is that of the mother to her
child, because the mercy the mother shows for her
child is never equalled by any other. Even the father,
in most cases, he does not have mercy with his

334

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

children as their mother does.
A woman came seeking her child amongst the captives,
and when she saw him, she held him with affection,
holding him to her chest in the presence of people and the
Messenger of Allah
Then, the Prophet g§| said: "D o you
think that this woman would cast her child into the fire."
They said, "N o O Messenger of Allah." He said: "Allah is
more Merciful with His servants than she is with her
son ."fl]
Exalted is His Majesty; and Mighty is His Sovereignty and
Authority.
If all the mercy of all who show mercy was combined, then
it would still be nothing compared to Allah's Mercy.
What proves this for you, is that Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime - created hundred forms of mercy, and put just one
of them in this world with which all the creations show
mercy to one another
All creation show mercy to one another, beasts and
humans; that is why you see a defiant she-camel raising
her leg for her child, for fear of hurting it while suckling it,
so that it can feed it with with ease. And in the same way,

him, he said: "I heard Allah's Messenger jte saying: 'Allah

earth. So from that portion, the creatues show mercy, such
that even the beast lifts up its hoof for its child, fearing that
it would be struck by it.'"

you find that a ferocious predator guards its offspring. And
if somebody enters into it in its den with its offspring, it
attacks him to defend them until it drives him away from
its offspring.
The affirmation of the Mercy of Allah, the Exalted, is
proven in the Book, the Sunnah, Ijma', and by the intellect.
As for the Book, affirmation of the mercy comes from
various angles. Sometimes by the mention of a Name, such
as His saying:

}A n d He Al-Ghafur, A r - R a lu m (Yunus 10:107)
And sometimes with an Attribute, as His saying:

iA n d Your Lord is Al-Ghafur, Owner o f Ar-Rahmah
(mercy)} (Al-Kahf 18:58)
and sometimes by an action, as in His saying:

}H e punishes whom He wills, and shows mercy to
whom He wills} (Al-'Ankabut 29:21)
and sometimes by using a noun showing superiority, as in
His saying:

}A n d He is the Most Merciful o f those who show
mercy} (Yusuf 12:64).
And similar to this is mentioned, in the Sunnah.
As for the intellectual proofs affriming mercy for Allah, the
Exalted; among them is what we see of many good things

336

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

that result from the command of Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime. Among them is the great deal of harm that we see
warded off on the command of Allah. All of these indicates
the mercy of Allah, intellectually.
When people are experiencing drought and famine; the
earth suffers from drought while the heavens are dry; there
is no rain, no plants sprout; then Allah sends down the
rain, and the earth begins to grow, the cattle eat to their
full, and the people drink the water. Even the average
person who does not study, if you ask him: "W hat is this
from?" He would reply: "This is Allah's mercy." No one
would ever doubt this.
So the Mercy of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is affirmed
by evidences in revealed texts, and intellectual evidence.
The 'Ash'ariyyah and others among the people of Ta'til
(denial) reject describing Allah, the Exalted with mercy.
They said that this is because the intellect does not prove
that. Secondly: They said that to show mercy is to be soft,
weak, tranquil toward the one being shown the mercy, and
this does not befit Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, because
Allah is greater than to behave with such mercy, and it is
not possible for Allah to show mercy!! They said that the
meaning of Ar-Rahmah is either the want for Ihsan
(beneficence), or it is Ihsan (beneficence) itself. That it is;
either it is favor, or the want to grant favor.
Now consider how they negated this magnificent Attribute,
which all the believers hope in and long for. If you ask
anyone; what do you want? He will reply: "I want the
mercy of Allah."

Commentary On The Introductory Notes.

337

They reject this, they said it is not possible that Allah be
described with mercy!
We refute their position from two angles: A submission,
and a refutation.
The sumbission is that we say, supposing that the intellect
does not prove that, but the revealed texts prove it, then it
is affirmed by another proof. And the general rule with
every sane person is that the lack of a particular proof does
not necessarily mean that what is being proven does not
exist. Because it may be affirmed by another evidence.
Thus, supposing that Ar-Rahmah is not affirmed by the
intellect, yet it has been affirmed by revealed texts, and
how many things are affirmed by numerous proofs!
As for the refutation; we say: Your statement that the
intellect does not prove Ar-Rahmah is false. Rather, the
intellect proves Ar-Rahmah. These favors that are witnessed
and heard about, and these thwarted dangers, what is their
cause? Their cause is Ar-Rahmah without a doubt! Had
Allah not shown His mercy on the servants, He would not
give them favors and protect them from dangers. This is a
widely witnessed matter, the elite and the average witness
it. An average person in his shop or in his market knows
that the these favors are the result of Allah's mercy!
What is amazing is that these people affirm the Attribute of
Al-Iradah (want, objective, volition) via Takhsis (particular­
ization, or individualization). They said Al-Iradah is
affirmed for Allah, the Exalted, by revealed texts, and the
intellect. With the textual proof, it is very clear; and with
the intellect, because Takhsis proves Al-Iradah.
The meaning of Takhsis, is that the particularization of how
the various creatures would be, proves Al-Iradah (want,
objective, volition). The heavens are heavens, the earths are
earths, these are stars, this is the Sun, all of these things are

338

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

different by means of Al-lradah; Allah wanted that to be the
heavens, and it was, and that this would be the earth, and it
was, and that a star should be a star, and it was, etc.
So Takhsis - they say - is evidence for Al-lradah, because if
there was no Iradah (want, objective, volition) then all
things would be one.
We say to them: Glorious is Allah, the Magnificent! This
evidence for Al-lradah, compared to the evidence in the
claim that Ar-Rahmah only means favor, is weaker and less
evident than the evidence that Ar-Rahmah only means
favor; because the evidence that Ar-Rahmah means favor is
equal, in that both the average and the elite would know it,
while the evidence of Takhsis for Al-lradah is such that only
the elite among the students of knowledge would know it;
so how do you reject what is more obvious, and affirm
what is more obscure? Is this anything except you
contradicting yourselves?
The behavioral aspects that we benefit from these Ayat:
The behavioral benefit derived here is that whenever a
person knows that Allah, the Exalted, is the Merciful, he
holds on to hope in Allah's mercy, and expects it. This
belief will encourage him to do everything that leads to
mercy. For example; Al-Ihsan. Allah, the Exalted, says
about that:

iV erily, Allah's mercy is near unto the Muhsininh (AlA 'raf 7:56).
At-Taqwa; Allah, the Exalted, said:

4^< >y. ?.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

339

4 / shall ordain fo r those who have Taqwa and give
Zakah; and those who believe in our Ayat...)> (Al-A'raf
7:156).
And faith; because it is among the means of earning Allah's
Mercy, as He, the Exalted, said:

^And He is especially Merciful (Rahiman) with the
believers} (Al-Ahzab 33:43).
The stronger the faith, the closer the mercy will be to the
one who has it, with the permission of Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime.

are pleased with H im ...$ (Al-M aidah 5:119)."

The Attribute of Pleasure

The Commentary
This is one of the Ayat about Ar-Rida (pleasure). Allah,
Glorious and Exalted is He, is described with Ar-Rida

340

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

(pleasure). He is pleased with the action and the doer,
meaning - Allah's pleasure has to do with the action and
the doer. As for the action, an example is His saying:

iA n d if you are grateful, He is pleased therewith for
y o u i (Az-Zumar 39:7).
That is; He is pleased with your gratefulness. And, as in
His, the Exalted, saying:

iA n d I am pleased with Islam as your religioni (AlM aidah 5:3)
And as in the authentic Hadith: "Allah is pleased with three
matters for you, and He detests three matters for you ..."[1]
This pleasure has to do with the action.
And the pleasure is also with respect to the doer, as is in the
Ayah cited by the author:

iA llah is Pleased with them, and they are pleased with
H im i (A l-M aidah 5:119).
Therefore, the Pleasure of Allah is an Attribute that is
affirmed for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and it is about
Himself; it is not separate from Him, as the people of Ta'til
(denial) claim.
If someone says to you: "Explain the meaning of pleasure
to me”, you will not be able to explain it, because in the
Reported by Muslim (1715) from Abu Hurairah, may Allah
be pleased with him.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

341

case of people it is an instinct; and it is not possible for a
person to describe it better and clearer than with its
expression.
We, therefore say Pleasure is an Attribute of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, and it is a real Attribute related to His
Mashiyy'ah (will), and it is among the Attributes of doing.
He is pleased with the believers, and with those who have
Taqwa, and with the just, and with those who are grateful.
He is not pleased with the disbelievers; He is not pleased
with the rebellious people, and He is not pleased with the
hypocrites. So He, Glorious and Exalted is He, is pleased
with some people, and He is not pleased with some people.
He is pleased with some deeds and detests some deeds.
Describing Allah with pleasure is affirmed by the evidence
of revealed texts, as preceded, and with intellectual
evidence. The fact that He, the Mighty and Sublime,
rewards those who are obedient, and compensates them for
their deeds and their obedience, is proof for Ar-Rida.
So if you say: "Using rewards - as you do - as evidence for
the pleasure of Allah, the M ighty and Sublim e, is
debatable, because Allah, Glorious is He, may give the
rebellious more favors than He gives to the grateful
person.” And this is a strong point.
But the reply to that is that His giving the rebellious person,
who is insistent on His disobedience, is a trap for him, and
it is not done out of pleasure.
As He, the Exalted, said:

i^And those who belie Our Ayat, we shall gradually

342

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

seize them with punishment in ways they perceive not.
And I respite them, certainly My plan is strong.)> (AlA 'raf 7:182-183).
And the Prophet
said: "Verily, Allah will respite the
wrongdoer, so that when He seizes him, He will not release
him”
and then he recited His statement:

iS u ch is the punishment o f your Lord, when He seizes
the towns while they are doing wrong. Verily, His
punishment is painful and severe$ (Hud 11:102).
And He, the Exalted, said:

iS o when they forgot (warning) which they had been
reminded, We opened fo r them the gates o f every
(pleasant) thing, until in the midst o f their enjoyment o f
that which they were given, all o f a sudden, We took
them (in punishment) and Lo! They were plunged into
destruction with deep regret and sorrow. So the root o f
the people who did wrong was cut off. And all praise is
Allah's the Lord o f the worlds$ (Al-An'am 6: 44,45).
As for when rewards come and the person is steadfast

that Allah is pleased with him.

•

The Ayat About the Attributes of Anger, Wrath,
Displeasure, Hatred

The Commentary
The author mentioned five Ayat about these Attributes:
The first Ayah:

iA n d whoever kills a believer intentionally, his
recompense is Jahannam to abide therein; and Allah is
angry with him, and curses h im i (An-Nisa 4:93).

❖ iWhoeveri is a conditional element implying generality.
❖

iA believeri He is whoever believes in Allah and His
Messenger, so the disbeliever and the hypocrite are

344

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

excluded from it.
However, whoever kills a disbeliever with whom there is a
treaty, or who lives under protection, or has been granted
security, then he is a sinner. But he does not warrant the
threat mentioned in the Ayah.
As for the hypocrite, his blood is clearly protected as long
as he does not make his hypocrisy public.
❖

And His saying: 4 intentionally4 excludes the immature
and the one who lacks sense, because these do not
have any recognizable intention and objective. And it
excludes the one who is mistaken, and the clarifica­
tion of that case is in the Ayah before this.

So, He who intentionally kills a believer, this recompense of
his, is a tremendous recompense.
❖

ijahannam4 is one of the names of the Fire

❖

4 to abide therein4 that is "to reside therein"

❖

4And Allah is angry with him4, Al-Ghadab (anger) is an
attribute affirmed for Allah, the Exalted, in the
m anner that befits Him. And it is one of His
Attributes of action.

❖

And 4and curses him4'. Al-La'n (the curse) is expulsion
and being distanced from Allah's Mercy.

❖

So these are the four types of punishment, and the fifth
is in His saying: iand a tremendous punishment is
prepared for him^

Five forms of punishment; one of which is enough
deterrence and restraint for the one who has a heart.
However, the mention of Al-Khalud (abiding) in the Fire is
problematic according to the Manhaj (methodology) of the
People of the Sunnah; because the punishment is to be

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

345

meted out for killing, and killing is not a form of Kufr
(disbelief), and there is no sin that deserves Khalud in Fire
according to the People of the Sunnah except Kufr. And the
reply to this is from a number of perspectives:
The first perspective: That this is about the disbeliever
when he kills a believer.
But this view is nothing, because the recompense of the
disbeliever is to abide in Jahannam, even if he does not kill a
believer:

lllj
} Verily! Allah cursed the disbelievers and prepared fo r
them a flaring fire (Hell). Wherein they will abide
forever and they will fin d neither a Wait (protector) nor
a helper} (Al-Ahzab 33:64,65).
The second perspective: That this is with regard to the one
who considers the killing of a believer to be lawful, because
the one who considers killing the believer to be lawful is a
disbeliever!
Imam Ahmad, was amazed with this view, and said: "How
is this? If he considers it lawful to kill him, then he is a
disbeliever even if he does not kill him. He is to abide in the
Fire, even if he does not kill him ."
So this response is also not supported.
The third perspective: That the application of this sentence
is conditional; that is, his recompense is Hell, to abide
therein, if He recompenses him. And there is some problem
with this view.
What would be the benefit of His saying:

346

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4,and his recompense is Jahannam } (An-Nisa 4:93)
if the meaning was "if He recompenses him?” We are now
asking: "If He indeed recompenses him, is this his
recompense?” If it is said yes; then the meaning turns back
into him abiding in the Fire. Then the problem arises again,
and we are not free of it.
These are three responses that are not safe from criticism.
The fourth perspective: That, this is a cause, but if a
preventative reason is found, the cause will not result. This
is as we say: Blood relation is a means of inheritance, but if
the relative is a slave, he will not inherit, because of a
preventing factor, which is slavery.
So we say that this action is a cause of abiding (in Hell), but
if the doer is a believer, he will not abide in the Fire.
But the problem still returns to us from another angle, and
that is, what is the benefit of this threat?
We answer; The benefit is that a person who intentionally
kills a believer, then he has done something that is a cause
which he will abide in the Fire for. Now, since a
preventative factor is possible; it may exist or it may not
exist (in his case), so he is therefore in a very grave
situation. This is why the Prophet #5 said: "A believer will
ever enjoy expanse in his religion as long as he has not shed
prohibited blood.” ^ When he sheds prohibited blood and we seek refuge in Allah - he may be constricted in the
matter of his religion until he exits out of it.
Based on this, the threat relates to his end result; because it
Reported by Al-Bukhari (6862) from Ibn 'Umar, may Allah
be pleased with him.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

347

is feared that this killing may have been caused by his
disbelief, hence he dies upon disbelief, so he abides (in the
Fire).
So in this Ayah, with this understanding, it mentions the
cause's cause; so intentionally killing is a cause that a
person may die upon disbelief, and disbelief is a cause of
abiding in the Fire.
I think if one considers this well, he would see that there is
no problem with it.
The fifth perspective: That the m eaning of Khalud
(abiding) is a long stay, and that what is intended is not
an eternal stay, because in the Arabic language, Khalud can
be generally used to mean a long stay, as it is said "So-andso is in prison forever” while prison is not eternal. And
they say: "So-and-so abides like the the mountain abides.”
And what is known is that, the mountains;

iM y Lord will blast them and scatter them as particles
of dust. Then He shall leave them as a level, smooth
plain> (Ta Ha 20:105,106)
This is also an easy answer; it does not cause concern. So
we say that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, did not
mention "eternally.” He did not say: "to abide therein,
forever” but He said "to abide therein,” the meaning is that
he shall stay there a very long time.
The sixth perspective: To say this is a threat of punish­
ment, and it is possible that it not be applied, because it is a
means of turning from justice to magnanimity. And turning
from justice to magnanimity is honorable and praisworthy.
Based upon this, a poet said:
"And indeed if I threaten him or promise him

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

348

I can break my threat and fulfill my promise
I threatened him with punishment,
and promised him a reward;
I can leave my threat, and fulfill my promise."
If you tell your son: "By Allah, if you go to the market I
shall hit you with this stick." Then he went to market;
when he returned, you hit him with your hand. This
punishment is lighter for your son. Therefore, when Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, threatens the one who kills with
this threat of punishment, and then He pardons him, this is
generosity.
But in reality, there is something of a problem in this; for
we say if He executes the threat, the same problem still
remains, and if He does not execute the threat, then there is
no benefit it being mentioned.
These are the six perspectives for the response about this
Ayah. The closest (to correctness) is the fifth one, then the
fourth.
An Issue
If the killer repents, is he still liable to this threat? The
answer is that he is not liable to the threat, according to the
text of the Qur'an; based upon His, the Exalted, saying:

course - and whoever does this shall receive the punish­
ment. The torment will be doubled to him on the Day o f
Resurrection, and he will abide therein in disgrace.
Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous
deeds; fo r those, Allah will change their sins into good
deeds, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful$ (AlFurqan 25:68-70).
This is clear, whoever repents, even from killing, Allah, the
Exalted, will change their sins into good rewards.
And in the authentic Hadith regarding the story of the man
from the children of Israel, who killed ninety-nine people,
and Allah put repentance in his mind. He went to a monk,
and told him that he had killed ninety-nine people, could
he be forgiven? The monk considered the matter to be too
grave, and said: "You cannot be forgiven." So the man
killed him, completing the hundredth with him. He was
directed to a scholar, and told him that he had killed a
hundred souls, could he be forgiven? The scholar replied:
"Yes, what would prevent you from being forgiven? But
this village; its inhabitants are wrong-doers, go to so-andso village, therein are people of goodness and right­
eousness."
Then the man began to travel and emigrated from his
village to the village whose inhabitants were people of
goodness and righteousness. His death caught up with him
on the way. Then the Angels of mercy and the Angels of
punishment began to dispute among one another (regard­
ing who would take his soul) until Allah sent a judge down
to them. He said, "Com pare what is between the two
villages, whichever of them he is closest to, he is from its
inhabitants." So he was closer to the village whose
inhabitants were people of righteousness. So the Angels

350

of mercy then took his soulJ1'
Look at how — despite the fact that he was of the children
of Israel — he was forgiven; while Allah had placed
burdens and restraints upon them which He lifted from
this Ummah; so repentance in its case is easier. If that was
for the children of Israel, how will it be for this Ummah?
If you say: "W hat do you say regarding the authentic
narration from Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him:
'There is no repentance for the k iller.'"^
Then the response is from one of these two perspectives:
1.

Either Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him,
considers it improbable that the killer would consider
repenting, and saw that he would not be guided to
repent, and if he was not guided to repent, then the sin
will not be removed from him; he would rather be
punished for it.
2. Or to the intent of Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased
with him, is that there is no repentance for him, with
regard to the right of the slain, because the one who
intentionally kills, three rights are related to him:
Allah's right, the right of the slain, and the third for the
guardian of the one slain.
A. As for the right of Allah, there is no doubt that
repentance will remove that; for His statement.

themselves, despair not o f the mercy o f A llah; verily
Allah forgives all sin s." } (Az-Zumar 39:53).
This is for those who repent.
B.

As for the right of the guardian of the one slain, it will
be lifted if he surrenders himself to them. If he goes to
them and says: "1 killed him, do whatever you like
with m e," they either avenge, collect the blood money,
or pardon him. The right belongs to them.
C. As for the right of the one slain, there is no way to lift it
in this world. Even though what appears to me is that if
he sincerely repents, even the right of the slain one will
be removed; not as a form of disregarding his right, but
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, with His grace, takes
the sin of the killer, and raises the slain in status in
Paradise, or pardons him of his sins, because sincere
repentance leaves nothing. The generality of the Ayah
in Al-Furqdn corrobates this:

4And those who invoke not any other god along with
Allah, nor kill such person as Allah has forbidden,
except fo r just cause. . . }
Up to His saying:

4 Except those who repent and believe, and do righteous
deeds; fo r those, Allah will change their sins into good
deeds} (Al-Furqdn 25:68-70).
The Attributes included in this Ayah are Al-Ghadab (anger),

they would do everything that earned the wrath of

statements, or actions.

But as for that which Allah is pleased with, their state
in regard to it was, as He said:<$And hated that which

pleased with. Therefore, their result was that awful
end, that at death, the Angels smote their faces and
backs.

Included in this Ayah, from Allah's Attributes, are the
affirmation of As-Sakhat (wrath, anger) and Ar-Rida (plea­
sure). The discussion has preceded regarding the Attribute of
Ar-Rida (pleasure), but as for (the attribute of) As-Sakhat, its
meaning is very close to the meaning of Al-Ghadab.

❖

$W hen } here is conditional, the verb of the condition

took vengeance upon them 4

Therein is a rebuttal against those who interpreted anger
and wrath to mean vengeance. The people of Ta'til such as
the Ash'ariyyah and others, say: "W hat is intended by anger
and wrath is vengeance, or the volition for vengeance.”
They do not interpret anger and wrath as Attributes of
Allah which He Himself is described with. They say, His
wrath means His vengeance or His volition for vengeance.
They either interpret Al-Ghadab to be the object of the
action, that is separate from Allah, and that is vengeance,
or; as volition, which they acknowledge. They will not
interpret it as an Attribute affirmed for Allah in the real
sense, in a manner that befits Him.
We say to them that anger and wrath are not vengeance.
Vengeance is the result of anger and wrath, as we say:
"Reward is the result of pleasure.” Allah, Glorious and
Exalted is He, was wrath with these people, and angry with
them, and then He took vengeance upon them. If they say
that the intellect does not allow any affirmation of wrath
and anger for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, then we
answer them with what preceded about the Attribute of
Ar-Rida (pleasure); because the topic is one.
And we say, rather, the intellect does prove wrath and

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

355

anger; because taking vengeance upon the criminals and
punishing the disbelievers is evidence for wrath and anger,
not evidence of pleasure, nor that anger and wrath are
merely vengance.
So we say: This Ayah:

4So when they Asafuna (angered Us)}
refutes you, because He made vengeance other than the
anger, since the condition (when) is not the same as what is
conditional (vengance was taken).
An Issue
It remains to say: <$So when they Asafuna (angered Us)}; we
know that the meaning of Al-Asaf is sorrow and remorse
over a thing that happened to the one who is remorseful
and cannot revert it, can Allah, therefore be described
with sadness and remorse?
The response: No! We reply about the Ayah, that the word
Al-Asaf has two meanings:
The first meaning: 4Al-Asaf} meaning sorrow, as in His,
the Exalted, concerning Yaq'ub:

4 “Alas, my grief for Yusuf!” And he lost sight because
of the sorrow} (Yusuf 12:84)
And A l-A sa f is generally used to mean wrath and anger.
The first meaning cannot be used for Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime. And the second is affirmed for Allah; because
Allah, the Exalted described Himself with it, He said:

made them the lag behind4 (At-Tawbah 9:46)

The fourth Ayah :

4But Allah was displeased with them being sent, so He
made them the lag behind4 (At-Tawbah 9:46)
❖

Meaning by that, the hypocrites, who did not go out with
the Prophet
to the military expeditions, because Allah
detested them going out with him, because their deeds
were not sincerely for Him, whereas Allah, the Exalted
has no need of any partners, and because if they went
out, then they were as Allah, the Exalted, said:

4Had they marched out with you they would have
added to you nothing except disorder, and they would

357

have hurried about in your midst (spreading corruption)
and sowing sedition among y o u } (At-Tawbah 9:47).
Since they were not sincere and were mischief-makers, and
Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, detests mischief-making
and Shirk, therefore:

}A llah was displeased with them being sent, so He
made them the lag behind} (At-Tawbah 9:46)
Means; He made their zeal spiritless toward setting out for
Jihad.

4And it was said (to them): "Sit you among those who
sit (at hom e)."} (At-Tawbah 9:46)
It is said: It implies that Allah said that this is what shall
be, and it implies that some of them were telling the others:
"Sit among those who sit (at home); so-and-so did not set
out, so-and-so did not go out" mentioning some of those
whom Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, had excused, such
as the blind and the lame. They said: "W hen the Prophet
returns, we will apologize to him, and he would seek
forgiveness for us, and that is enough for us." It is possible
that we harmonize between these two views, because if
such was said to them, and they sat, they would not have
stayed behind except by the decree of Allah, Exalted is He.
In this Ayah there is the affirmation that Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, detests, this is also affirmed in the Book and
Sunnah. Allah, the Exalted, said:

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

358

4_And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but
Hinify
up to His saying:

4All the bad aspects o f these (the above mentioned
things) are hateful to your Lord$ (Al-lsra' 17: 38)
As it is in this Ayah which the author mentioned:

4But Allah was displeased with them being sent, so He
made them the lag behind4 (At-Tawbah 9:46)
The Prophet % said: "Allah detests that you engage in 'he
said, and it was said .'"[11
Therefore, detestation is affirmed in the Book and Sunnah;
that Allah, Exalted is He, detests.
The displeasure of Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He,
regarding a thing, can be with regard to the action, as in the
Ayah:

4But Allah was displeased with them being sent, so He
made them the lag behind4 (At-Tawbah 9:46)
And as in His saying:

4AII the bad aspects o f these (the above mentioned

This is because it is from the worst of matters; that a person
says what he does not do.
The meaning of this, is that if you said something and you
do not do it, you fall under one of the two conditions: You
are either a liar about what you said, but you are afraid of
people; you therefore tell them what is not the truth. Or,
you are just aggrandizing what you say to people. You
command people to do it, but you do not do it, and you
prohibit people from it, and you do it yourself.
Al-Maqat (hate) is among the Attributes included in this
Ayah, and that it varies, and of the behavioral aspects is the
caution against a person saying what he did not do.

The Ayat Concerning the Attributes of Coming and

The Commentary
The author, may Allah have Mercy upon him, mentioned
four Ayat affirming the Attribute of coming and arriving.
The first Ayah: His statement:

iD o they then wait fo r anything other than that Allah
should arrive to them with a shadow o f the clouds and
the Angels? (Then) the case would be already ju dged.$
(Al-Baqarah 2:210)
❖

Concerning His statement: 4Do they then wait...?)*,
4Hal (Do they)4, is an interrogative element intended
to express negation, meaning they do not wait. Every
time that illla (except/other than))* occurs after an
interrogative element (in Arabic grammar) the inter­
rogative element expresses negation. This is a (gram­
matical) principle. The Prophet sg said: "A re you any
other than a bleeding finger?" ^

❖

The meaning of ith ey wait)*, here is they expect. That
is, these liars do not expect anything other than that
Allah should come to them upon the shadows of the
clouds, and that is on the Day of Resurrection.

❖

i j h a t Allah should arrive to them with a shadow4 'Ft'
here means "w ith." It certainly does not stand for an
adverb of place, because if it was used as an adverb
of place, it will suppose that the shadows surround
Allah, and it is known that Allah, the Exalted, is AllEncompassing, All-Knowing; nothing of His creatures
surrounds Him. Therefore, 4 fi Zulalin)* means "w ith
a shadow" because Allah, the Sublime and Majestic,
The Prophet
said it in one of the battles while his finger
bled, he said: "Are you other than a bleeding finger, and in
the Cause of Allah is that which you got." Reported by AlBukhari (6146) and Muslim (1796), from Jundab bin Sufyan

when descending to separate His slaves:

$The heaven shall be rent asunder with c l o u d s (AlFurqdn 25:25)
White clouds; tremendous shadows; due to the coming of
Allah, Blessed is He and Exalted is He.
❖

Concerning His statement: iwith the shadow of the
clouds^: 4Al-Ghamam^,; the scholars say they are
white clouds, as Allah says, while mentioning His
favors to the Children of Isra'il:

4And We shaded you with clouds (Al-Ghamdm))> (AlBaqarah 2:57)
The white cloud leaves the weather shining, unlike the
black and the red (clouds), because there is some darkness
in them. It is a more beautiful vision.
❖

Concerning His statement: iAtid the Angels)>; "the
Angels/' as the subject, is combined with the expres­
sion of Majesty (the Name) "Allah.” Meaning; "or
that the Angels should arrive to them.” The Angels
will arrive on the Day of Resurrection, because they
will descend to the earth. Those at the lowest heaven
will descend, then the second, then the third, then
the fourth, and like that, until the seventh, to
surround the people.

This is a warning concerning this Day, which will be like
this. It is a tremendous event among the events of the Day
of Resurrection. Allah warns these liars about it.

Angels should arrive to them, or that your Lord should

arrive! } (Al-An'am 6:158)
❖

Here, we say about: 4 Do they then wait4 as we
explained about the preceding Ayah; that is, these
people do not expect anything except one of these
situations:

Firstly:

pother than that the Angels should arrive to themfy
that is, to seize their souls. Allah, Exalted is He, says:

$And if you could see when the Angels take away the

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

364

souls o f those who disbelieve (at death), they smite their
faces and their backs, (saying): "Taste the punishment
o f the blazing Fire"}- (Al-Anfdl 8:50)
Secondly:

«£Or that your Lord should arrive}
on the Day of Resurrection to judge among them.
Thirdly:

iO r that some o f the Ayat o f your Lord should arrive!}
this is the rising of the sun from the west. The Prophet
explained it (the Ayah) as such.[1]
Allah only mentioned these three situations:
Because when the Angels descend to seize their souls,
repentance will not be accepted from them, according to
His, the Exalted, statement:

4And o f no effect is the repentance o f those who
continue to do evil deeds until death faces one o f them
and he say s: "Now I repent" } (An-Nisa' 4:18)
And in the same way, when the sun rises from the west,
because repentance will not be accepted, then they will not
be able to find salvation from what they did.
[11

Reported by Al-Bukhari (4636) and Muslim (157) from
Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

365

He mentioned the third situation, between the two, because
it is the period of recompense, and the period of harvesting
the fruit of deeds. At that time, they will not be able to find
salvation from what they did.
The focus of this Ayah and the one preceding it, is to warn
these liars of allowing time to run out against them; then
they will not be able to find salvation from their deeds.

He emphasized this grinding because of its greatness, and
because it indicates that the mountains, and the mountain
passes, and all other things will be ground to powder, so
much that the earth will become like a tanned skin. Allah,
Exalted is He, said:

iThen He shall leave it as a level smooth plain. You
will see therein nothing crooked or curved} (Ta Ha
20:106-107)
And it could imply that the repetition of the }Dakkan} is
not for emphasis, but with the meaning; "Grounding
after grounding."

He said: }A nd your Lord comes, with the Angel in

Judgment when the earth had been ground to powder

ishall be rent asunderi, meaning it shall be rent
asunder, some then more, and these clouds will come
out from that, with agitating smoke erupting, some
sent out, then more. The heaven is rent asunder with
the clouds, as it is said: "The earth is rent asunder
with plants;” meaning the clouds will bulge out from
the heavens and break up, one after another, and that
is due to the coming of Allah, the Mighty and
Sublim e, to judge am ong His servants. It is a
frightening and terrible day.

❖

Concerning His statement: iA n d the Angels will be
sent down, descendingi, they will descend from the
heavens one by one. The Angels of the lowest heaven
will first descend, then the second, then the third,
and like that. In the context of this Ayah, there is no
mention of Allah's coming, but there is an implica­
tion of that, because the rending asunder of the
heavens with clouds is because of His, the Exalted,
coming, based on the evidence of the preceding Ayat.

368

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The author cited these four Ayat to affirm an Attribute
among the Attributes of Allah; and that is His coming.
The People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah affirm that Allah,
Himself, shall arrive, because He, the Exalted, mentioned
that about Himself. He, Glorious is He, knows best about
Himself, and about others; He is more truthful in His
Speech than others, and is of the best speech. His Speech is
from the most perfect of all knowledge, truthfulness,
exposition, and volition. Therefore, Allah, Mighty and
Sublime, wanted to explain the truth to us, He is the Most
Know ledgeable, the M ost Truthful and the Best in
narrating.
However, a question still remains. Do we know the manner
of this coming?
The Response: We do not know it because Allah, Glorious
and Exalted is He, informed us that He shall come, but He
did not inform us of how He will come, and because the
manner of something is not known except through
witnessing it, witnessing its like, or by the report of one
who is honest about it. These four are not found regarding
the Attributes of Allah, the Exalted. And when there is a
lack of knowledge about the essence, then there is a lack of
knowledge about the attributes. That is, its manners; thus,
the essence exists in reality; and we know it. We know
what the meaning of essence is, and what the meaning of
the self is. In the same manner, we know the meaning of
the coming, but the how of the essence, or the self, or the
manner, of the coming is unknown to us. We therefore,
believe that Allah shall come, in reality, and in the manner
that befits Him, which is unknown to us.
The Antagonists of the People of the Sunnah and the
Jama'ah, and the Rebuttal Against them
The people who engage in Tahrif and Ta'til oppose the

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

369

People of the Sunnah and the Jama ah concerning this
Attribute. They say: "Allah will not arrive, because if you
affirm that Allah shall arrive, you have affirmed that He is
physical, and physical beings are similar/'
We say this claim and analogy is false, because it opposes
the texts, and He, Exalted, said:
<^0 A -* J i C i J ( j

ji

4And verily, (either) we or you are rightly guided or in
a plain error$ (Saba' 34:24)
If you say that this - which opposes the text - is the truth,
then the text becomes false, whereas it is impossible that a
text be false. But if you say the text is the truth, then this
becomes false, inevitably. Then, we are asking: "W hat is it
that would prevent Allah, the Exalted, from arriving
Himself, in the manner which He wants?” They said that
the preventative factor is that if you affirm that, you have
engaged in Tamthil.
We say this is an error, because we know that the manner
of arriving differs, even in the case of creatures. So an ablebodied person walks as if descending from a high place
due to his ability, but he is not walking arrogantly, and if
you like, then say he is walking arrogantly, is he like the
one who walks leaning on a walking stick, who would not
take another step except after being fatigued?
And arriving differs from another angle. The arrival, for
example, of an important personality or a leader to a town,
is not like the arrival of an ordinary person who is not
recognized.
What does the person of Ta'til have to say regarding His,
the Exalted, saying:

370

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

<$And your Lord c o m e s (Al-Fajr 89:22)
And its like?
He would say that the meaning is the command of your
Lord comes, because Allah says:

$The command, ordained by Allah will arrive, so seek
not to hasten ify (An-Nahl 16:1)
So - he says - it is necessary that we interpret every form of
arriving that Allah attributes to Himself based on this Ayah,
and we say that the meaning is the command of Allah arrives.
Then it should be said that this evidence that you cited is
one against you, not for you! If Allah, the Exalted, meant
the arrival of His command in the other Ayat, then what
prevents Him from saying: "H is command," and when He
means command, He says command, and when He does
not mean command, He does not say command. This, in
reality, is a proof against you, because the other Ayat are
not summaries, such that we could say that they are
elaborated upon by this Ayah.
The other Ayat are clear. Some of them even have
distinctions which prevent the possibility that His coming
means command:

iD o they then wait fo r anything other than that the
Angels should arrive to them, or that your Lord should
arrive, or that some o f the Ayat o f your Lord should
arrive!$ (.Al-An'am 6:158)

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

371

Is it right for anyone to say: }your Lord should arrive}
means His command, with this kind of classification?
If somebody asks: "W hat do you say concerning His, the
Exalted, saying:
y

o'

} Perhaps Allah may bring a victory or a decision
according to His Will} (Al-Maidah 5:52)
The answer is: What is intended by that is the bringing of
victory or the decision; but Allah attributed its arrival to
Himself, because it is from Him. This is a style that is
known in the Arabic language. If the action of arriving is
restricted with a preposition, for example, what is intended
by that action of arriving is the noun, which is the object of
that preposition; and when it is loosely used (without any
limitation/restriction) and attributed to Allah without any
restriction, what is intended by it is the arrival of Allah, in
reality.
As for the behavioral manners which are derived from faith
in the Attribute of Allah, the Exalted, Coming and
Arriving:
Its fruit is the fear of this event, and this tremendous
occasion, upon which the Lord, the Mighty and Sublime,
arrives to judge and separate among His servants, and the
Angels descend. Nothing will remain before you except the
Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, and all creation; if you do a
good deed, you will be recompensed, and if you do other
than that, you will definitely be recompensed for it, as the
Prophet sfe said: "Indeed, man will be alone with Allah,
Exalted is He, he would look to his right, so he will not see
anything except what he has sent forth. He will look to his
left; so he will not see anything except what he has sent

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

forth. And he will look before him; he will not see anything
except the Fire confronting his face. Therefore, protect
yourselves from the Fire, even if it is with a piece of a
date."[1]
So faith in these tremendous matters, without a doubt, will
sire fright in a person, and fear of Allah, Glorious and
Exalted is He, and will make him steadfast in his religion.

And His saying: } Everything will perish save His

The Attribute of Face for Allah, Glorious is He

The Commentary
The author, may Allah have Mercy upon him, mentioned
two Ayat affirming the Attribute of Face for Allah, the
Exalted.

beginning of the second volume.

4And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honor
will abide forever} (Ar-Rahman 55:27)
This is joined to His statement, Exalted is He:

4 Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the
Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honor will abide
forever} (Ar-Rahmdn 55:26-27)
Therefore, some of the Salaf (pious predecessors) said: "It is
necessary when you recite;

4 Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish}
that you continue with His statement:

4And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honor
will abide forever}”
So that the imperfection of creation is clear, and the
perfection of the Creator is clear and that is because they
are opposites. This stands for extinction, while the other
stands for eternity -

4Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish. And the
Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honor will abide
forever} (Ar-Rahman 55:26-27)
❖

Concerning His statement: 4And the Face of your Lord

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

full of Majesty and Honor will abide forever
will not perish.

that is, it

A l-W ajh (the Face): Its meaning is known, but its how is
unknown. We do not know how the Face of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, is, just like the other attributes of His.
But, we believe that He has a Face that is described as full
of Majesty and Honor; described with magnificence and
greatness and marvelous light, so much so that the Prophet
gjg said: "H is Screen is light, if He unveils it, the Sublimity
of His Face will bum whatever His vision reaches in His
creation."111
"The Sublimity of His Face," meaning its magnificence, its
Greatness, its Honor and its Light.
"W hatever His vision reaches in His creation," and His
vision reaches everything. Based on this, if He unveils this
Screen - the Screen of Light - from His Face - everything
would be incinerated.
That is why we say: This Face is a marvelous Face; it can
never be likened to the faces of the creatures. And based on
this, we say that from our creed is that we affirm that Allah
has a Face, in reality, and we derive that from His, the
Exalted saying:

4And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honor
will abide forever^ (Ar-Rahman 55:27)
And we say that this Face cannot be likened to the faces of
the creatures, based on His, the Exalted, saying:

Reported by Muslim (179) from Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari,
may Allah be pleased with him.

iT h ere is nothing like unto Him4 (Ash-Shura 42:11)
We are ignorant of the nature of this Face, based on His, the
Exalted, saying:

4And they will never encompass anything o f His
Knowledge4 (Ta Ha 20:110)
If anybody attempts to imagine the how of this, with his
mind, or to discuss it with his tongue, we say (to him): You
are an astray innovator, saying about Allah what you know
not. And Allah has prohibited from saying about Him what
we know not. He, the Exalted, said:

4 Say: "(But) the things that my Lord has indeed
forbidden are Al-Fawdhish (great evil sins), unrighteous
oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allah for
which He has given no authority, and saying things
about Allah o f which you have no knowledge
(AlA 'raf 7:33)
And He, Exalted is He, also says:

each of those you will be questioned (by Allah)i (Allsra' 17:36)
He says here: iA nd the Face of your Lord full of Majesty
and Honor will abide forever$ He attached (His) Lordship
to Muhammad
This kind of Lordship is the most
special form of Lordship, because Lordship can be
general and specific. The specific one is the most special,
and more special above, like Lordship of Allah to His
Messengers. Therefore the most special Lordship is the
most virtuous without a doubt.

Concerning His statement: ifull (Dhu)f: is a
description of the Face. The proof is that it is in the
nominative case. If it was an Attribute of the Lord,
He could have said jP h i Al-Jalalii (using it in a
genitive case) as He said in the same chapter (Surah):

iBlessed be the Name of your Lord (Allah), the Owner
of Majesty and Honori (Ar-Rahman 55:78)
So, when He said: jPhii Al-Jalalii in the nominative case,
we know that it is a description of the Face.

cence, is worthy of being honored and praised, Glorified
and Exalted is He. The honor of each one is in accordance
with who he is. So, the manner of honoring Allah is to give
Him His due regard and glorify Him in the best manner;
not because He is in need of you honoring Him, but so as to
favor you with reward.
The second Ayah : His statement:

4 Everything will perish save His Face}
28:88)

(Al-Qasas

His statement: 4 Everything will perish4 that is, will vanish,
as His statement:

4 Whatsoever is on it (the earth) will perish4 (ArRahman 55:26-27)
❖

His statement: }Save His Face4 is equivalent to His
statement:

}A nd the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honor
will abide forever} (Ar-Rahman 55:27)
The meaning is that everything will become extinct and
will vanish except the Face of Allah, Exalted is He, for it
will remain forever. That is why He said:

4 His is the Decision, and to Him you (all) shall be
returned} (Al-Qasas 28:88)

378

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

He is the Eternal Judge, to whom people shall return for
judgment among them.
It is said regarding the meaning of the Ayah: 4 Everything
will perish save His Facefy, that it is; except what is done
for His Face. They said the context of the Ayah points to
that:

i m At)
4And invoke not any other Ilah (god) along with Allah,
there is no Ilah (god) except H im . Everything will perish
save His Face. His is the Decision, and to Him you (all)
shall be returned4 (Al-Qasas 28:88)
As if He was saying: And invoke not any other god as
partners with Allah, because your deed and your joining a
partner with Him will perish, meaning - be wasted and in
vain - except what you do sincerely for His Face, for that
will remain forever, because the good deed has a reward
that will remain forever in the gardens of bliss.
However, the first meaning is more to the point and
stronger.
Based on the position of those who are of the opinion that it
is permissible to combine the two meanings, we say it is
possible that we consider the Ayah with the two meanings
since there is no contradiction between them; so it is
interpreted in both ways. As a result, it will be said:
Everything will vanish except His, the Mighty and
Sublime, Face, and every deed will be in vain save what
is done seeking the Face of Allah. According to either of the
two understandings, the Ayah contains evidence of
affirmation of the Face for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
It is among the Informative Attributes of His Essence that

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

379

when being used for us, refers to portions and parts. We
will not say it is of the Attributes of His Essence in meaning
(Al-Ma'nawiyah). If we say that we will (by that) agree with
those who change the meaning by making Tahrif We do
not say it is a part of Allah, or a section of Allah, because
that will improperly stir the notion of im perfection
concerning Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He.
Besides, the people of Tahrif interpret the Face of Allah to
mean His reward. They said that what is intended by the
face in the Ayah is His reward. Everything will vanish save
the reward of Allah! They, by that, interpreted the Face which is the Attribute of perfection - to be a creation that is
clearly separate from Allah that can vanish or exist. The
reward exists after it existed not, and it is possible that it
ceases to exist - if not for Allah's promise of preserving it it would be considered possible based on reasoning, that it
is made transient; meaning - the reward. Do you now say
that the Face of Allah - with which He described Himself is of a probable matter or a certain matter?
If they interpreted it to mean reward, it will become a
matter of probability which may or may exist not.
Their position is refuted by the following:
Firstly: It contradicts the apparentness of the expression,
because the apparentness of the expression suggests that
this is a specific face, not a reward.
Secondly: It contradicts to the consensus of the Salaf (pious
predecessors); none of them said that what is intended by
face is reward. Their books are with us, preserved. Bring
out a text from the Companions, or from the scholars
among their students and those who follow them faithfully,
stating that they interpreted it this way; you will never find
a way to that!

380

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Thirdly: Is it possible that the reward is described with
these great attributes:

iF u ll o f Majesty and Honor^ (Ar-Rahman 55:27)
It is not possible. If we say for example; the reward of the
righteous is full of majesty and honor, this is never
possible. And Allah, the Exalted, described this Face as
being full of majesty and honor.
Fourthly: We say, then what do you say regarding the
saying of the Messenger 3|g: "Its Screen is light; if He
unveils it, the sublimity of His Face will bum whatever His
vision reaches among creation."^
Does the reward have this light which bums whatever
Allah's vision reaches among His creation? Never! It is not
possible.
With this, we recognize the falsehood of their saying, and
that what is necessary for us is that we interpret this Face,
according to what Allah intended by it, and that is - a Face
abiding with Him, Blessed and Exalted be He; described
with Majesty and Honor.
If you ask: Should everything that comes regarding the
word (Face) while being attached to Allah be considered as
referring to the Face of Allah - that which is His Attribute?
The response: This is the basis, as it is in His, the Exalted,
statement:

ojcjj odft /JL 'jjf
$And turn not away those who invoke their Lord,
[i]

Its reference preceded.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

morning and afternoon seeking His Face) (Al-An'am
6:52)
And;

)A n d have in his mind no favor from anyone fo r which
a reward is expected in return, except only the desire to
seek the Face o f his Lord, the Most H igh; he surely will
be pleased) (Al-Layl 92:19-21)
And other Ayat like these.
The basis is that what is intended by the Face attributed to
Allah, is the Face of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, which
is an Attribute from His Attributes; but there is a word
regarding which the scholars of Tafsir differ, and that is
His, the Exalted, statement:

iA n d to Allah belong the east and the west, so
wherever you turn yourselves or your faces there is the
Face o f A llah) (Al-Baqarah 2:115)
iS o wherever you turn), meaning — wherever you turn
your faces while in Salah, ith e r e ), meaning — there is
the Face of Allah.
Among them are those who say that the Face (here) means
the direction, based on His statement:

)F o r every nation there is a direction to which they face
(in their prayers)) (Al-Baqarah 2: 148)
So, what is intended by face is the direction; that is - there is

382

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

the direction that Allah accepts your prayers when you face
it. They said because it (the Ayah) was revealed concerning
the case of journey, when one observes a non-obligatory
Salah, that such a person should pray facing wherever He
turns his face, or if he is confused regarding the Qiblah, he
should endeavor to find it, and then pray facing wherever
he eventually turns to.
However, the correct position is that what is intended by
the face here is the real Face of Allah. It, therefore, means:
Wherever you turn your faces to, there is the Face of Allah,
Glorious and Exalted is He, because He encompasses
everything, and because it is established from the Prophet
that "W hen the praying person stands for Salah, Allah
will turn His Face toward h im ."[11 That is why one is
prohibited from spitting before him, because, Allah is in his
front.
If you pray in a place where you do not know the direction
of the Qiblah, after you have attempted to find it, then
eventually it is discovered that is was actually behind you,
Allah still faces you even in this condition. This is the
correct interpretation that agrees with the obvious meaning
of the Ayah. The first meaning does not contradict it, in
reality.
If we say it means there is the direction of Allah, then there
is proof (for it) whether this proof is the interpretation of
the second Ayah, in the second explanation of the Face, or
something that is related from the Sunnah. For if you turn
your face towards Allah in Salah, that is the direction of
Allah, where He accepts your Salah, while facing it, there is
also the Face of Allah, in reality. Therefore, the two
meanings are not contradictory.
Reported by Al-Bukhari (406) and Muslim (547) from Ibn
'Umar, may Allah be pleased with him.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

383

And you should know, that this Great Face, which is
described with Majesty and Honor, it is not possible to
encompass it with descriptions, nor is it possible to
encompass it with imagination. Rather, everything you
imagine, Allah, the Exalted, is above that, and greater, as
He, the Exalted, said:

4And they will never encompass anything o f His
Knowledge4 (Taha 20:110)
If it is said: What is the intended meaning in His statement:

4Everything will perish save His Face}
28:88)

(Al-Qasas

If you say the intended meaning is the Essence (of Allah), it
is feared that you have altered the intended meaning. If
you understand the Face to mean the Attribute itself; you
have fallen into error, and that is the opinion held by some
people who do not give Allah His due right, they say; Allah
will vanish except His face. So what do you do?
The Response: If you mean by your saying "except the
essence/' that Allah, Exalted is He, will remain forever; He
Himself, with the affirmation of the Face for Allah, that is
correct. It will therefore mean that He said the Face,
representing the Essence of the One who possesses the
Face. But if you mean by your saying; "except the essence"
that the face is just used to stand for the Essence, without
affirming the Face (of Allah), this is Tahrif (distortion) and it
is not correct.
Based on this, we say 4Save His Face}, that is - except His
Essence that is described as having a Face. There is

4 What prevents you from prostrating yourself to what I
have created with both M y Handsfy (Sad 38:75)
❖

iW hat prevents y ou f, the address is to Iblis.

❖

4Ma)f it is an interrogative pronoun used to express
censure. Meaning - what is that thing that prevented
you from prostrating yourself.

❖

Concerning His statement: 4To what I have created
with both M y H a n d s He did not say: "To one whom
I created/' because the meaning here is Adam, by
mentioning an attribute of his which no one else
shares with him, and that is that Allah created him
with his Hand, so it is not about his person. That is
why when Iblis wanted to assault Adam and degrade
him, he said:

-{Shall I prostrate to one whom You created from clay?4
(.Al-Isrd’ 17:61)
We have established that when { M a { is used for one that
possesses intellect, then it refers to the meaning of the
description, not the meaning of a particular individual or
person. From its examples is His, the Exalted, saying:

{Then marry (other) women o f your c h o i c e (An-Nisa’
4:3)
He did not say Man (who) because what is intended is not
the person of a woman, but the intended meaning is the
description. So, here, He said: {T o what (Li-Ma) I have
created with both M y Hands{ meaning — "This
magnificently described one, which I honored, since I

386

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

created him with my two Hands” and He did not intend
"to whom I created” meaning - this particular human
being.
His saying: iT o what I have created with both My Hands)>,
is like the statement of the one who says: "I write with a
pen.” The pen is the instrument of writing. And when
you say: "I produce this with my hand;” the hand is the
instrument of production.
So, $To what I have created with both My Hands$ means
that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, created Adam with
his Hand, and here, He said: "w ith my two Hands”
which is the dual form, and the letter Nun is omitted
from the dual (noun) for the reason of annexation.
This Ayah contains the rebuke of Iblls for him refusing to
prostrate to what Allah created with His Hand, and that is
Adam, peace be upon him. It also contains the affirmation
of the Attribute of creation, for He says: $to what I have
created$ The affirmation of the attribute of two Hands for
Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He, is also contained in it;
the two Hands with which He performs actions, such as
creation, as we have here; the two Hands with which He
holds (as He says):

iT h ey made not a just estimate o f Allah such as is due to
H im . And on the Day o f Resurrection the whole o f the
earth will be grasped by His Hand^ (Az-Zumar 39:67)
It is with them that He grasps, for Allah, Exalted is He,
takes Sadaqah and nurtures it as a human being nurtures his
colt.™
111

Based on the report of Al-Bukhari (1410) and Muslim (114)
from Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, who

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

387

And His statement: iT o what I created with both My
Hands$ also contains a form of honor for Adam, peace be
upon him, considering the fact that Allah created him
with His Hands.
The people of knowledge said: "Allah wrote the Tawrah
with His Hand, and planted the garden of 'Adn with His
H and."[1] These three things were all done with the Hand
of Allah, Exalted is He.
Perhaps we should not forget here, by the virtue of its
appropriateness, one of the sayings of the Prophet
"Indeed Allah created Adam in His image."^2| We have
mentioned that one of the two correct ways of interpretat­
ing it is that Allah created Adam in the image which He
chose, and took care of. That is why Allah attached it to
Himself, to show its nobility and honor. Just as in the case
of the attachment of the camel and the House to Allah, and
in the attachment of the Masjids to Allah. The second view
is that it is in His image, in reality, but that does not
necessitate a similarity.

said: "The Messenger jg said; 'One of you gives Sadaqah
with a date from what is pure - and Allah does not accept
except that which is pure - and Allah puts it in His right
Hand, and then nurtures it as one of you nurtures his colt
or his young weaned camel, until it becomes like Uhud.'"
Reported by Ad-DarimI in Ar-Radd 'Ala Bishr Al-M arisi (p.
35), Al-Hakim (2:319), and Al-Baihaqi in Al-Asma' was-Sifat

They say: iA lldh's Hand is tied u p } meaning - is
restrained from spending, as Allah, Exalted is He,
says:

}A n d let not your hand he tied (like a miser) to your
n eck} (Al-Isra' 17:29)
That is, restrained from spending.
And they said:
sit
iT ru ly , Allah is p oor} (Al 'Imran 3:181)
As for their saying: iA llah's Hand is tied u p }, they said:
"If Allah's Hand had not been tied up (from spending)
everybody could have been wealthy. The fact that He
provided abundantly for Zaid, but does not provide
abundantly for 'Amr, is a form of restraint and the lack
of spending!”
They said: iT ru ly , Allah is p oor} because Allah says:

}W ho is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that
He may multiply it to him many tim es?} (Al-Baqarah
2:245)
Then they told the Messenger
"O Muhammad, your
Lord is needy, now He wants us to lend Him a loan!!” May
Allah destroy them! The Jews also said: "Allah is incapable,
for when He created the heavens and the earth, He relaxed
on Saturday, and took a holiday in lieu of a celebration day,
and as such Saturday became their celebration day.” May
Allah destroy them!

390

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

❖

Here, Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said: $The Yahud
(Jews) say: "Allah's Hand is tied up."^: ifia n d y .
They made it singular because a hand spends less
than the two hands; that is why the response came
with dual and expansion (that is with two Hands
that are widely outstretched) and said $N ay, both His
Hands are widely outstretched^

❖

For they described Allah with this defect, Allah
punished them for what they said, and He said: $Be
their hands tied up$ meaning — prevented from
spending. That is why the Jew s are the m ost
avaricious people and the most miserly. They are the
most miserly of all the servants of Allah, and the
most rapacious. It is not possible for them to spend
one small monetary unit, except that they expect that
they will get a Dirham in return! We now see that
they have large and tremendous organizations, but
with these organizations and charities, they want
more and more; they want to control the world.
Therefore, O man, there is no need to ask how do we
harmonize between His statement, Exalted is He: <$Be
their Hands tied up$ and what is happening today
concerning the Jews! Because these people offer
(things), only to gain more.

❖

4And be they cursed fo r what they u t t e r e d that is, they
were being expelled and banished from the mercy of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, because the calamity
is related to what was uttered. When they described
Allah with being stingy, they were expelled and
banished away from His mercy. It was said to them:
"If Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is as you have
said - that He does not spend - He would deny you
His mercy, so much so, that He would not give you

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

391

anything out of His generosity.” They were thus
punished with two things:
1.

2.

By the description they used to insult Allah, Glorified
be He, being true about themselves, by His statement:
}B e their hands tied u p }
By making what they said occur; by banishing them
away from the Mercy of Allah, so that they do not find
Allah's generosity, magnanimity, and favour.

❖

Then Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, invalidated
their claim, and said: }N ay , both His Hands are widely
outstretched^

❖

}N a y } (Bal) here indicates a revocative retraction.

Consider how the expression now varies; }N ay , both His
Hands are widely outstretched} because the situation is one
of being praised with generosity and spending with the
two Hands, which is more perfect than spending with
one hand.
❖

And $ widely outstretched} is the opposite of their
statement: }tied u p }; therefore, the Hands of Allah
are widely outstretched, spending liberally. The Pro­
phet jig said: "The Hand of Allah is full of generosity
(spending a great amount), night and day. What do
you think of what He has been spending since the
creation of the heavens and the earth; what is in His
Right Hand does diminish.” 11'

Who is he that can estimate what Allah has been spending
since the creation of the heavens and the earth? Nobody
can estimate it! Yet, with that, whatever is in His Right
[11

Reported by Al-Bukhari (7411) and Muslim (993) from
Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him.

392

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Hand does not diminish. This is like His, the Exalted,
statement, in the Hadith Qudsi: "O My servants! If the first
of you and the last of you, the men of you and the jinn of
you stand on one plain, and ask of Me, and I grant
everyone what he asks for, that will not reduce what is
with Me, except in the degree which a needle will reduce
(from the sea water) when it is dipped into the sea."^1'
Let us consider the needle when it is dipped into the sea,
and when you take it out, it will never reduce anything
from the sea. This kind of style is adopted to express with
absolute certainty the lack of reduction, because nothing
reduces from the sea in this example, as is well-known, and
it is impossible that the sea be reduced by this. It is also,
therefore, impossible that the Dominion of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, diminishes, if every man and every
jinn were to stand and asks Allah, Exalted is He, and He
gives everybody what he asks for; that will not reduce
anything in His Dominion.
Do not say: "Yes, it will not reduce because it (the water)
moved from His Dominion to His Dominion." If this was
the meaning, the whole statement would be considered
useless and meaningless. But the meaning is, if it is
assumed that these marvelous gifts that are given, were
outside of the Dominion of Allah, that would not reduce
anything from His Dominion.
If the meaning is the first one, it would not have any
Reported by Muslim (2577) from the Hadith of Abu Pharr,
may Allah be pleased with him. Ahmad said regarding it:
"It is the best Hadith of the people of Ash-Sham (greater
Syria)." (Jdmi' A l-’Ulum wa Al-Hikam (2:34)), and Imam Ibn
Rajab has an extensive explanation of it in his book Jdmi'
Al-'Uliim wa Al-Hikam.

benefit. It is already known that if you have ten Riydls with
you, and then take them out of the the right drawer, and
put them into the left drawer, and somebody says: "Your
money does not reduce/' it will be said this is a useless
statement!
What is important is that the meaning is; if what is given to
those who ask, was to be removed from His Dominion, that
would not reduce what is with Him, Glorious and Exalted
is He.
And the spending of Allah, the Exalted, is not restricted to
what we acquire in terms of Dirhams or belongings alone,
rather every favor is from Allah, the Exalted, whether the
favor is related to the religion or the world. The rain is
among that which Allah spends on us, and the plants'
seeds are among that which Allah spends.
Will it be said after this, as said by the Jews - may the wrath
of Allah be upon them - 4Allah's Hand is tied upfy?
No! By Allah! It will rather be said: "Indeed the Hands of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, are widely outstretched,
with spending and favors that can never be counted nor
estimated." But if it is asked why did He give to Zaid and
did not give to 'A m r?"
We say; because the absolute authority and all encompass­
ing wisdom is Allah's, Exalted is He. That is why He said,
refuting their doubts: $H e spends as He w ills.$ There are
among people those whom He gives much, and among
them whom He gives little, while there are among them
those whom He gives an average amount, out of His
wisdom, even though the one who is given little is not
debarred from the grace of Allah, and His spending in
other areas. Allah gives him good hearing, good sight,
sound mind, and other favors that cannot be enumerated.
But for the oppression of the Jews, their hostility, and

394

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

that they did not consider Allah free of attributes of
imperfection, they said: 4 Allah's Hand is tied u p i
The two earlier mentioned Ayat contain the affirmation of
the Attribute of two Hands for Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime.
However, one may say: Allah has more than two Hands,
according to His, the Exalted, saying:

iJD o they not see that We have created fo r them o f what
Our Hands have created, the c a t t l e ( Y d Sin 36:71)
<$Our Handsfy here is in the plural form, so we
understand by this that it means plural; because if we
understand it to be plural, we have, by that, included the
dual form, as well as what is more. So what would be
the response to this? The response is to say: The mention
of the Hand is related in singular, dual, and plural
forms.
As for the Hand that is related in the singular form, the
singular that is in the genitive case implies the plural;
therefore, it includes everything that is established for
Allah regarding Hands. The proof of the generality of the
singular that is in genitive case, is His statement, Exalted is
He:

iA n d if you count the Blessing o f Allah, never will you
be able to count them .4 (Ibrahim 14:34)
iN i'm ah (blessing)i is singular in the genitive case, which
includes many blessings according to His statement:
in ev er will you be able to count them4 therefore, it is not
one, not one thousand, neither a million nor millions.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

395

} Allah's H and}, we say this singular does not prevent
plurality once it has been affirmed, because the singular
in the genitive case implies a generality.
As regards the dual and the plural, we say Allah does not
possess except two Hands, as that is established in the Book
and the Sunnah. In the Book:
He says in Surah Sad:
i% Z Z Z Q >
}T o what I have created with both My Hands} (Sad
38:75)
This is a case of honoring, if Allah had created him with
more than two Hands, He would have mentioned it,
because the more the Attribute with which Allah created
this thing increases, the more the esteem of that thing
increases. Also, He says in Siirat Al-Ma'idah:

}N ay , both His Hands are widely outstretched} (AlMa'idah 5:64)
In refutation against those who said: } Allah's H and} with
singular. The case here is one that calls for numerous
favors, and the more the means of spending are, the
more the spending is. If Allah had had more than two
Hands, He would have mentioned them here. Since the
spending with a hand is spending, but it becomes more
and more perfect with two Hands than one hand; and
with three hands — if it assumed to be so — it would be
more. So if Allah, Exalted is He, had more than two
Hands, He would have mentioned them.
As for the Sunnah; the Messenger jgj said: "Allah, Exalted is
He, will roll up the heavens with His Right, and the earth

396

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

with His other Hand."^1'
He ^ said: "Each of His Two Hands is R ight."[2]
He did not mention more than two.
And the Salaf (pious predecessors) have a consensus that
Allah has two Hands, without any addition.
So, we have with us a text from the Qur'an, the Sunnah and
the consensus, that Allah, Exalted is He, has two Hands.
How do we now harmonize between this and the plural:

iO fw h a t Our Hands have created^ (Yd Sin 36:71)
We say: The harmonization will be according to one of
these two views:
1. That we say what some of the scholars said; that the
least number that is considered as plural is two, and
based on that $Our Hands$ will not refer to more
than two Hands. That is, it is not necessary that it
refers to more than two; hence, it is in accord with
the dual form:

4N ay, both His Hands are widely outstretched^ (A lMa'idah 5:64)
Then, there is no problem. If you ask what is the proof of
the people that say that the least number to be considered
plural is two? The response is that they argue using His

(2788) from the Hadith of Ibn 'Umar and Abu Hurairah,

statement, Exalted is He:

4 I f you two turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are
indeed so inclined} (At-Tahrim 66:4)
They were only two, while the word 4Qulub} (hearts) is
plural, while w hat is intended with it is just two
hearts.
And His statement, Exalted is He:

4Allah has not put fo r any man two hearts inside his
body} (Al-Ahzab 33:4)
And like that too, for no woman.
They also argued using His statement, Exalted is He:

4 l f the deceased left brothers, the mother has a sixth}
{An-Nisa' 4:11)
The word 4lkhw ah} (brothers) is a plural, while what is
intended here is dual.
They also argued using the fact that Salah in Jamd'ah
(congregation) results with two persons.
But, the majority of the Arab linguists and grammarians
say that the least number to be considered plural is three,
and that the plural is considered as dual in these texts due
to reasons; otherwise, the least number to be considered as
plural is three.
(Translation note): Meaning in reference to 'Aishah and
Hafsah, may Allah be pleased with them.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

398

Or, that we say that the meaning by this plural is
exaltation, the exaltation of His Hands; the intended
meaning is not that Allah, Exalted is He, has more than
two Hands.
Then, what is intended by the Hand (mentioned) here is the
Self that possesses the Hand. Allah, Exalted is He, had said:

}E vil has appeared on land and sea because o f what the
hands o f men have earned ^ (Ar-Rum 30:41)
That is because of what they earned, whether with hands,
feet, tongues, or any other part of the body. But this kind of
expression is used to refer to the doer himself. That is why
we say that Allah did not create the cattle — which refers to
camels — with His Hand. The difference between His
saying:

} O f what Our Hands have don e} (Yd Sin 36:71)
And His statement:

}T o what 1 have created with both My Hands} (Sad
38:75)
Is as if what Allah was saying in the Ayah } O f what Our
Hands have done} is what "W e have done,” because what
is intended by the Hand (here) is Allah, who possesses
the Hand, while the intended meaning by }W ith both My
H ands} is the two Hands, and not the Self.
And with this, the confusion regarding the Attribute of
Hand which is related in singular, dual and plural forms is
removed.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

399

It is therefore known now, that the harmonization between
the singular and dual is easy, since this is related as a
singular in the genitive case, and therefore it includes
whatever is affirmed for Allah about Hands.
But as for the difference between dual and plural, the
harmonization will be from two view points:
One of them is that the real plural — which is at least three
— is not intended, but what is rather intended by it is
majesty, as Allah, Exalted is He, would say: ^Indeed
We..
i W e . . and; iW e said.. . f and the like, whereas
He is One. But He said this to express majesty. Or to say
that the least number considered being plural is two,
then there will be no contradiction.
As for His statement:

4 With power (Ayd) did We construct the heaven$
(Adh-Dhariyat 51:47)
The meaning of ^Ayd$ here is power. The intended
meaning by it here is not the Hand, the Attribute of
Allah. That is why He did not attribute it to Himself. He
did not say "W ith Our H and."
The like of that, is in His statement, Exalted is He:

4(Remember) the Day when the Shin shall be laid barefy
(Al-Qalam 68:42)
Because the scholars of the Salaf have two opinions
regarding His statement:

^When the Shinfy (Al-Qalam 68:42)

400

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The first opinion is that what is intended by it is "strength.”
And the second opinion is that what is intended by it is the
Shin of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. Whoever considers
the context of the Ayah together with the Hadith of Abu
Sa'id, may Allah be pleased with him/1' then he would say
that what is intended by the Shin here is Allah's Shin.
While, whoever considers the Ayah alone, he would say
that the intended meaning by the Shin is "strength.”
If somebody says: "You affirm that Allah, the Exalted, has a
Hand in reality, while we do not know of hands except the
hands of the creatures, by that, your position will therefore
suggest Tashbih (likeness) between the Creator and the
creatures?” We respond by saying, our affirmation of Hand
for Allah, does not necessitate that we likened the Creator
and the creature, because the affirmation of the Hand
comes in the Qur'an, the Sunnah and the consensus of the
Salaf (pious predecessors), while the negation of likeness
between the Creator and the creature is proven by the
Sharfah, the intellect, and senses.
As for the proof from Sharfah, that is His statement,
Exalted is He:
O '#
4There is nothing like unto H im ; He is the All-Hearer,
the All-Seer^ (Ash-Shura 42:11)
As for the intellect: It is not possible that the Creator is like
the creatures in His Attributes, because this will be
considered a defect of the Creator.
As for the senses: Everybody can see that the hands of

The Hadith of Abu Sa'id is reported by Al-Bukhari (7439)
and Muslim (183).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

401

creatures vary and are different in terms of being large, and
being small, being bulky and being thin...and so on.
Therefore, the fact that hands of creatures are different
proves that the Hand of Allah, the Exalted, will be different
from the hands of the creatures, and that He, Glorious and
Exalted is He, is more worthy of being unlike them in the
first place.
Besides, the people of Ta'til (denial) among the Mu'tazilah,
Jahmiyyah, the Ash'ariyyah and the like, have opposed the
People of the Sunnah and the Jama ah in affirming the Hand
for Allah, Exalted is He.
They said: "It is not possible that we affirm a hand for
Allah in reality. Rather what is intended by hand is just an
abstract matter, and that is power!! Or, that the meaning of
the hand is favor, because in the Arabic language hand can
be generally used to mean power and favor.
In the long authentic Hadith of An-Nawwas bin Sam'an,
may Allah be pleased with him, (it is stated): "That Allah
shall reveal unto 'Isa that: 'I shall raise some servants
whom nobody will have the hand to fig h t.'"[1] And the
meaning of the Hadith is that nobody will have the power
to fight them - they are Ya'juj and Ma'juj.
As for the use of hand to mean favor, this occurs often;
among such is the statement of the Quraish's messenger to
Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him: "If it were not
for you having a hand upon me which I did not repay, I
could have replied to y o u "[2] ; meaning - "a favor."

[11
^

Reported by Muslim (2937) from An-Nawwas bin Sam'an,
may Allah be pleased with him.
Reported by Al-Bukhari (2731) and (2732).And the
messenger of the Quraish was 'Urwah bin Mas'ud.

402

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

And the saying of the Al-Mutanabbi:
How tnany has the darkness of the night upon you from hands
Establishing that the Mdnawiyyah lies.
The Mdnawiyyah is a sect of Majus (Magians) those who say
that the darkness creates evil, while the light creates good.
Al-Mutanabbi is saying: You are given a lot of provisions
during the night, which shows that the Mdnawiyyah lie,
because your night brings goodness.
Therefore, the meaning by Allah's Hand is favor and not
hand in reality, because if you affirm a real hand for Allah,
that will imply antropomophization of Allah, meaning that
Allah has a body, and bodies are similar. With that you fall
into what Allah has prohibited in His statement:

4,So put not forward similitudes for Alldhb (An-Nahl
16:74)

We have better evidence than you do, O those who affirm
the reality (of the Attributes). We are saying: Glorified is He
who is free from all forms of accidents, parts and ends!!
You will not find the likes of this rhymed prose, neither in
the Book nor in the Sunnah."
Our response to this is from a number of viewpoints.
Firstly: The interpretation of the Hand to mean power or
favor is contrary to the apparentness of the expression. And
whatever opposes the apparentness of the expression is
rejected, except with evidence.
Secondly: It opposes the consensus of the Salaf (pious
predecessors), since all of them are agreed that the meaning
of Hand is Hand, in reality.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

403

If somebody asks you where is the consensus of the Salaf
(pious predecessors) related? Bring me a statement from
Abu Bakr, or 'Umar, or 'Uthman, or 'All, may Allah be
pleased with them, saying: "The meaning of Hand is Hand,
in reality/' I say to him: "Bring me a statement from Abu
Bakr, 'U m ar, 'U thm an, 'A ll and others am ong the
Companions, and the scholars after them, saying that the
meaning of Hand is power or favor." He will not be able to
bring that.
Therefore, if they had another saying that opposed the
apparentess of the expression, they would have said it, and
it would have been related to us from them. But since they
did not say that, it is know n that they took the
apparentness of the expression, and they agreed upon that.
This is a tremendous point; and it is that when there is
nothing related from the Companions, may Allah be
pleased with them, opposing the apparentness of the Book
and the Sunnah, and they did not express other than that since they are the ones in whose language the Qur'an was
revealed, and Prophet #1 addressed them with their
language; so they would certainly understand the Book
and the Sunnah based on what is apparent of it - then if
nothing opposing that is related from them, then this is
their view.
Thirdly: It is highly impossible that favor or power is what
is meant in His statement:

4To what I have created with both M y Handsfy (Sad
38:75)

Since that would necessitate that there are just two favors,
while the favors of Allah are innumerable. It would also

404

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

necessitate that the power is two, whereas power has just
one meaning, it cannot be numerous. This expression
highly negates that what is intended by the Hand is either
power or favor.
Supposing that it is possible that what is intended by His
statement:

iN a y , both His Hands are widely o u t s t r e t c h e d (AlMa'idah 5:64)
Is His favor - based on interpretation; it is never possible to
intend favor with His statement:

iT o what I have created with both My H andsi
As for power, it is not possible that what is intended by the
two Hands in the two Ayahs all together is power, that is
His statement: iT o what I created with my H andsi - for
power cannot be numerous.
Fourthly: If the intended meaning of the Hand is power,
then Adam will enjoy no superiority over Iblis; not even
over a donkey and the dogs, because they were all created
with the power of Allah. If the intended meaning of the
Hand is power, the proof against Iblis will not be valid,
since Iblis will say: "And I, my Lord, you created me with
your power, with what you have preferred him over m e?"
Fifthly: This Hand which Allah affirmed for Himself is
related in such different manners that prevent it meaning
favor and power. It is related with the mention of the
Fingers, Holding, Stretching, Palm and "the Right." All
these show that power cannot be intended by it, because
power cannot be described with these attributes.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

405

It becomes clear by this, that the view of those who distort
the Attributes of Allah and assert that the meaning of Hand
is power, is false, from a number of viewpoints.
It has preceded that the Attributes of Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, are of the matters of the unseen and are known
only by revealed information, for which there is no place
for the intellect. In m atters such as these, w hat is
compulsory upon us is to leave them in their apparentness,
without any opposition to that.

Affirming the Two Eyes of Allah, the Exalted

The Commentary
The author, may Allah have Mercy upon him, mentioned
three Ayat regarding the affirmation of the two Eyes for
Allah, Exalted is He.
The first Ayah: His statement:

^So wait patiently (O Messenger o f Allah M ) fo r the
Decision o f your Lord, fo r verily, you are under Our
Eyes$ (At-Tiir 52:48)

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

406

❖

The address here is to the Prophet

❖

As-Sabr Patience, means "to confine," and from it is
their saying: "H e was killed in captivity (Qutila
Sabran)" meaning, he was killed and he was confined
to be killed.

In the Shari'ah, they say it is to have Sabr with the rulings of
Allah, meaning, confining the soul to the judgments of
Allah; and the judgments of Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, Exalted is He, are either of the Shari1ah type, or
the universal type.
As for the Shari'ah type, they are orders and prohibitions.
Thus, having patience upon obedience to Allah means
being patient upon the commands, while being patient
against disobeying Him is patience to stay away from the
prohibitions.
As for the universal type: They are the decrees of Allah,
the Exalted. So one must be patient with what He has
willed and decreed.
And based upon this meaning, some of them said that
patience has three categories: Patience upon obedience to
Allah, patience to stay away from disobeying Allah, and
patience with Allah's decrees that are distressing.
So, His saying:

4 So wait patiently for the Decision of your Lord}
— has three categories:
1.
2.
3.

The patience upon obedience to Allah;
The patience to stay away from disobeying Allah;
And with the decrees of Allah.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

407

That is, be patient with the decision of your Lord, be it the
universal type, or the Shari'ah type.
With this, we know that the classification which the
scholars mentioned - that the patience is of three categories:
Patience upon obedience to Allah, patience to stay away
from disobeying Allah, and patience with the decrees of
Allah - that all of this is included in this Ayah:

4 So wait patiently fo r the Decision o f your Lord.$
The basis of its inclusion, is that the judgment (of Allah) is
either of the universal type, or the Shari'ah type; and the
Shari'ah type refers to the commands and prohibitions;
meanwhile Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, commanded
the Prophet s|| with some commands, and prohibited him
from some matters, and destined some matters upon him.
The commands are such as:

4 0 Messenger! Proclaim that which has been sent down
to you from your Lord$ (Al-Ma’idah 5:67)
And;

4 Invite to the Way o f your Lord 4 (An-Nahl 16:125)
These are serious commands. That is, if it is said to a
person: "W orship your Lord/' he would find it easy to
worship Him. But Da'wah and conveying (the message) is a
heavy task, because he is burdened by the obstacles and
struggles against him of the others, so the matter becomes
very heavy.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

408

As for the prohibitions, He prohibited him from Shirk. He
said:

4.And be not you o f the Mushrikinfy (Al-An'am 6:14)
And;

i l f you join others in worship with Allah, (then) surely
(all) your deeds will be in vainfy (Az-Zumar 39:65)
As for the Decreed judgments, he experienced harms from
his people; verbal abuses, and physical abuses, such that
none would be patient with them except the likes of the
Messenger jggj.
They harmed him verbally, by scoffing him, mocking him,
condemning him, and by scaring the people away from
him. They also harmed him with their actions. He was once
in the Ka'bah, the most secure spot on the earth; he was
there prostrating to His Lord, when they went to him with
the intestines of a camel, and put it on his back while he
was in prostration. ^
There is no worse harm than this, while knowing that even
if a disbelieving idolator entered the Haram, he would be
safe from them, they would not harm him there. They
would rather honor him; provide him with wine, and Zara-

Based on the report of Al-Bukhari (3854) and Muslim
(1794) from 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased
with him, who said: "While the Prophet ^ was prostrating
and some people from the Quraish were around him,
'Uqbah bin Abi Mu'ait came with the uterus of an camel
and hurled it upon the Prophet's #1 back.''

zam water to drink! And this is Muhammad M,, harmed by
them while prostrating to Allah!
They would usually bring filth, what was putrid, and
impurities, and dump them at his doorstep! He went out to
the people of Ta'if What happened? Severe torture! Their
idiots and young lined up beside the walkway, and started
hurling stones at him, until they made his heel bleed so
much that he fainted and did not regain consciousness
except at Qam Ath-Tha'alib
❖

He was patient with the decrees of Allah; but that was
the patience of a believer who believes that the end will
be his. For Allah has said to him:

[11

Based on the report of Al-Bukhari (3231) and Muslim (1795)
from' Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her - the wife of the
Prophet 3H- that she said to the Prophet s*: "Has there been a
day more severe on you than the day of Uhud?" He said: "I
have faced from your people, what I faced, and the most
severe of what I faced from them, was that on the day of
'Aqabah, when I brought myself before Ibn 'Abd Yalll bin
'Abd Kulal, and he did not respond to what I wanted. I
proceeded, worried, while I headed in the direction I faced,
and I did not recover until I was at Ban! Ath-Tha'alib's place.
So, I raised my head, and a cloud was shading me. I looked
and saw Jibril, who called saying: 'Allah has heard the
saying of your people to you, and how they stave you off.
And Allah has raised the Angel of the mountain for you, so
you may command him with what you will for them.' So, the
Angel of the mountain called, and gave me Salam, and then
said: 'O Muhammad, that is with regards to what you will; if
you will that I cover them up with the two rocks/ and the
Prophet sjg said: 'Rather I wish that Allah brings from their
loins, those who will worship Allah alone, without ascribing
any partners to Him.”'

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4So wait patiently (O Messenger o f Allah
fo r the
Decision o f your Lord, fo r verily, you are under Our
Eyes$ (At-Tur 52:48)
This expresses a feeling of concern and respect. The most
honorable of all things with which one can honor a person,
is that you say to him: "You are under my eye; you are in
my heart/' and the like. So: "You are under my eye" means
— I am watching you with my eyes. This expression is well
known to people. Adequate and complete guard, care and
protection are guaranteed with this kind of expression.
Therefore, His statement: 4Eor you are under Our Eyes4
meaning — for you are being guarded and protected in
the utmost.
❖

illn d e r Our E yesy That is, "O ur Eyes are with you,
We are protecting, guarding and caring for you."

In the noble Ayah, there is the affirmation of the Eye for
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, but it is stated in the plural
form, for reasons that we shall mention, if Allah, the
Exalted, wills.
The eye is one of the Inform ative (A l-K habariyyah)
Attributes of His Essence (Adh-Dhatiyyah). It is AdhDhatiyyah because Allah shall eternally be described with
it, and (Al-Khabariyyah) (informative) because what is
named, in our case, refers to portions or parts.
For us, the eye is a part of the face, while the face is a part of
the body. But with respect to Allah, it is not permissible to
say: It is a part of Allah, for it has preceded that this word
(part) is not intended, and that it will suggest splitting the
Creator into parts, and it will also suggest that the part is
the one which can affect the eternity of the whole with its

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

411

extinction, and that it (the part) can cease to exist.
Meanwhile, the Attributes of Allah can never cease to
exist. They will rather remain forever.
An authentic Hadith from the Messenger of Allah ^ has
proven that Allah has only two Eyes, while he was
describing the Dajjdl, saying: "H e is (A'war) one-eyed and
your Lord is not one-eyed"^1] In another wording: "H e is
blind in his right e y e . 2'
Some people have said that the meaning of "A'war" is one
with a defect (in an eye) not one-eyed. There is no doubt
that this is a form of distortion, and the feigning of
ignorance of the authentic wording reported by Al-Bukhari
and others that: "H e is blind in his right eye as if his eye is a
protruding grape."[3] This is crystal clear! The word A'war
in the Arabic Language is not used except to express being
one-eyed, but if it is said: 'Awar or 'Awdr" it can be
generally used to mean a defect.
This Hadith proves that Allah has only two Eyes. The basis
of using it as a proof, is that if Allah had more than two
Eyes, stating that when clarifying the matter would be
clearer that saying one-eyed.
This is because if Allah had more than two Eyes, he would
have said: "Your Lord has Eyes," since if He had more than
two eyes, that the Dajjdl is not the Lord becomes even
clearer.
And also, if Allah had more than two Eyes, that would be
from His perfection. Therefore, not mentioning it will be

considered a form of neglecting to praise Allah, because a
large number indicates power, perfection and complete­
ness. If Allah had more than two Eyes, the Messenger sf|
would have explained it, so that the belief in this perfection
will not elude us.
In his book, As-Sawa'iq Al-Mursalah, Ibn Al-Qayyim, may
Allah have Mercy upon him, mentioned a Hadith, but it is
weak due to a break in the chain of its transmission, and
that is: "If a servant stands up observing Salah, he is
standing between the two Eyes of A r-Rahm an..."J1'
"Two eyes" is used here, but the Hadith is weak, and we
depend in our creed upon the authentic Hadith; the Hadith
discussing the Dajjal for it is clear to the one who ponders
on it.
'Uthman bin Sa'id Ad-Darami, may Allah have Mercy
upon him, mentioned that in his refutation against Bishr
Al-Marisi, and in the same manner, Ibn Khuzaimah
mentioned it in Kitdb At-Tawhid, and Abu Al-Hassan AlAsh'ari, and Abu Bakr Al-BaqillanI also related the
consensus of the Salaf (pious predecessors) on it. The
matter regarding this is clear.
So, our creed, based upon which we worship Allah, is that
Allah has only two Eyes, not more.
If it is said: "There are some among the Salaf (pious
predecessors) who interpreted His statement, Exalted is He,
illnder Our Eyes} to mean 'with Our looking.' Some
known scholars among the Salaf interpreted it to mean
this, and you are saying that Tahrif is prohibited and
Ibn Al-Qayyim mention it in the book As-Sawa'iq (256) and
in Ad-D a‘ifah (1024), Al-AlbanI said: "Very weak, reported
by Al-'Uqaill in Ad-Du'afa' (p 24) and Al-Bazzar in his
Musnad (553 - K ashf Al-Astdr)."

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

413

rejected." What will be the answer? The reply is that:
they interpreted it based on the sense conveyed by this
expression, while still affirming the basis, and that is the
Eye. The people of Tahrif only say: "under Our looking"
without affirming the Eye. The People of the Sunnah and
the Jama'ah are saying: "under Our Eyes" means "under
Our w atch ", while still affirm ing the Eye. But the
mention of Eye here is of a stronger emphasis and regard
than the mere mention of seeing. That is why He said:
iFor you are under Our Eyes^
The people of T a'til (denial) say: "You have surrounded
us with your argument from every angle, rejecting our
Ta'wil, now you engage in Ta'wil by interpreting the Ayah
by other than its apparentness. In Allah's saying: 4For you
are under Our Eyes$, you take it upon its apparentness,
and when take it upon its apparentness, you commit
Kufr, and when you do not take it upon its apparentness,
you have contradicted yourselves. So one time, you say
Ta'wil is allowed, and another time you say that Ta'wil is
not allowed, and label it Tahrif. Is this anything other
than injustice with Allah's religion?!"
We say we take it according to its apparentness, whole­
heartedly, and that is our path; we will not oppose it.
They say: "The apparentness of the Ayah is that Muham­
mad
was inside Allah's eye; as it would be said: 'Zaid is
with the house (Bil-Bait),' 'Zaid is with the Masjid (BilMasjid)."' They say that the Ba is an adverbial particle. So it
would therefore mean that Zaid is inside the house, and
inside the Masjid. Therefore, His statement: funder Our
Eyes} will mean "inside our eyes"!
If you say this, you have committed Kufr, because you have
made Allah a place to accomm odate creatures, and
become, by that, Huliiliyyah (pantheists). If you do not

414

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

say that, then you have contradicted yourselves?!"
We say to them: We seek refuge in Allah! We seek refuge in
Allah! Then, we seek refuge in Allah! If what you said is the
obvious meaning of the Qur'an, and you believe that this is
the obvious meaning of the Qur'an, you have committed
Kufr; because whoever believes that the obvious meaning
of the Qur'an is Kufr and deviation, then he is an astray
disbeliever.
Therefore, repent to Allah from your saying that this is the
obvious meaning of the expression. Ask all the Arab
Linguists among the poets and the orators whether they
understand from this kind of expression that the person
being looked at with the eye, is actually inside the eye? Ask
whomever you like among the scholars of Language, alive
or dead!!
If you know the various styles in the Arabic Language, you
will know that this meaning they mentioned and heaped
upon us is never intended in the Arabic Language, not to
mention attributing it to the Lord, the Mighty and Sublime.
So attributing it to the Lord is rejected Kufr, and it is
rejected in the language, the Shan ah, and according to the
intellect.
If it is said: "H ow do you explain the Ba contained in His
statement: ^.Under Our E y e s iy We reply that it means
accompanying. If I say: "You are under my eye," it
means that my eye is accompanying you, and watching
you, and is not neglecting you. Therefore, the meaning is
that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is saying to His
Prophet, "B e patient awaiting the Decision of Allah,
because you are surrounded with Our care, and Our
seeing with the Eye, such that none will afflict you with
any harm ."
It is not possible that the Ba’ here is is an adverbial particle,

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

because it would suggest that the Messenger of Allah % is
inside Allah's Eye. This is impossible! Also, the Messenger
of Allah
was being addressed while he was on the earth.
If you say he is inside Allah's Eye, then the meaning of the
Qur'an will be considered false.
This is another angle showing the invalidity of the claim
that the apparentness of the Qur'an is that the Messenger
is inside Allah's Eye, Exalted is He.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

❖

Concerning His statement: 4And We carried him upon
something (Dhat) with planks (Alzvah) and nails
(Dusr)4; meaning — "on the ship, possessing planks
(Alwah) and nails (Dusr)". He, peace be upon him,
constructed this ship; then, when his people passed
by him, they would mock him. Then, he said:

4 lf you mock at us, so do we mock at you likewise, for
your mocking4 (Hud 11:38)
He constructed it according to the order of Allah, and
under the care and custody of Allah. Allah said to him:

4And construct the ship under Our Eyes and with Our
Inspiration4 (Hud 11:37)
So Allah, the Exalted, was watching him while he was
constructing the ship, and was inspiring him about how to
construct it.
Allah describes it here in His statement: 4 (Dhat) with planks
(Al-Wdh) and nails (Dusr)y. 4Dhat4 meaning; possessing.
Al-Wdh; that is, (planks of) wood. Ad-Dusur: What the
wood was bound with, like nails, and rope, and the like.
The majority of the scholars of Tafsir said that it refers to
the nails with which the planks of wood were held
together.[11
❖

iFloating under Our Eyesf: This is the evidence:
This was said by Ibn 'Abbas, Sa'id bin Jubair, Al-Qurtubl,
Qatadah, and Ibn Zaid. And Ibn Jarir preferred it. See the
Tafsir of At-Tabari and (that of) Ibn Kathlr.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

417

^Floating)* that is, the thing that was made of planks
and nails, under the Eyes of Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime. The intended meaning with the Eyes here is
only two Eyes, as has been explained. The meaning
of floating under them, is "accompanied by Our
watching with Our Eyes." The particle Ba here, is
used to express "to accompany". It floated upon the
water that descended from the heavens and gushed
forth from the earth, because Nuh, peace be upon
him, supplicated to his Lord saying:

$1 have been overcome, so help (m e)!} (Al-Qamar 54:10)
So Allah, Exalted is He, said:

}S o We opened the gates o f heaven with water pouring
forth. And We caused the earth to gush forth with
springs4 (Al-Qamar 54:11-12)
Then, this ship was floating under the Eye of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime.
Someone can say: "W hy didn't He say: 'W e carried him on
the ship or we carried him on the boat,' and instead said:
4 0 n something with planks and nails}?" The response to
this is that He said "something with planks and nails"
instead of "on the boat" or "on the ship," for three
reasons:
The first reason: To maintain the relationship between the
Ayat and their different parts, for if He said: "W e carried
him on the boat", it would not be in harmony with what
comes before and after the Ayah. And if He said: "on the
ship", it would also be like that. But for the purpose of

418

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

harmonizing the Ayat in their contexts and words, he said:
}O n something made o f planks and nails}
The second reason: So that people can learn how to
construct ships, and to know that they are constructed from
planks and nails. That is why Allah, Exalted is He, said:

4And indeed, We have left this as a sign, then is there
any that will remember? } (Al-Qamar 54:15)
Therefore, Allah, Exalted is He, left its knowledge as a sign
for people to be able to construct (ships) as He, Exalted is
He, inspired in Nuh.
The third reason: To indicate its strength, since it was
made from planks and nails, and the ambiguity here, is to
show its greatness.
So the focus was on what it was constructed of.
An example of mentioning the description without the
name of what is being described, is His, the Exalted, saying:

}M ake you Sabighat} (Saba' 34:11)
He did not say "Dhuru'an” (coats of mail), because of the
special concern for the benefit of these coats of mail, and
that is that they should cover (and protect) completely. So
this is similar.
❖

And concerning His statement, Exalted is He: 4floating
under Our E yes}, we say about this, as we said about
His, the Exalted, statement:

}F o r verily, you are under Our E yes} (At-Tur 52:48)

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

419

The third A yah: His statement:

}A n d I endued you with love from M e, in order that
you may be produced under My E y e} (Ta Ha 20:39)
❖

The address is directed to Musa, peace be upon him:

❖

Concerning His statement: } And I endued you with love
from M e}, the scholars of Tafsir differ regarding its
meaning.

Some of them said: 4And I endued you with love from M e}
means "I love you.”
Some of them said it means "I endued you with love from
people” while the cause of that is from Allah. That is,
whoever sees you, they will love you. The proof of this is that
when the wife of Fir'awn saw him, she loved him, and said:

}K ill him not, perhaps he may be o f benefit to us, or we
may adopt him as a son } (Al-Qasas 28:9)
If somebody says: "Is it possible that you understand that
the Ayah carries two meanings?” We will answer yes;
based on the principle, and that is, whenever an Ayah can
convey two meanings which are not contradictory, then, it
may be used for both of them together. Therefore, Musa,
peace be upon him, was beloved to Allah, the Mighty and
Sbulime, and beloved to the people. When they saw him,
they loved him. The reality is that the two meanings are
inter-related, because if Allah loves a servant, He casts his
love into the hearts of the servants.
It is reported from Ibn 'Abbas that he said: "Allah loved
him, and He made His creation love him.”

420

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

❖

Then, He said: $in order that you may be produced under
My Eyefy producing something is to fashion the thing
into a particular form, such as turning plates of iron
into an axe, and turing wood into a door, and
producing everything according to its form. There­
fore, production of a house means building a house,
the production of iron, means making utensils with
it, for example, and engines. And the production of a
human means raising him, physically and intellec­
tually. To raise him physically is to provide him with
food, and to raise him intellectually is to teach him
etiquette, manners and the like. This was the case
with Musa, peace be upon him, for he was raised
under Allah's Eye.

When the family of Fir'awn found him, Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, protected him from them killing him, despite
the fact that they were killing the male children among the
Children of Israel. Allah decreed that he, the one for whom
the others were being killed, would be reared in the
household of Fir'awn. The children were being killed
because of him, and he was nurtured in safety under their
care. So look at this marvelous decree!
Of Allah's nurturing him, is that he was taken to the foster
mothers that would suckle him; but he was never suckled
by any one of them.

4 And We had already forbidden (other) foster suckling
mothers fo r him$ (Al-Qasas 28:12)
He never suckled from any other woman. His sister had
been charged by his mother. She went to them and said:

you, and sincerely they will look after him in a good

me” . Then they followed her. He, Exalted is He, said:

iSo did We restore him to his mother, that she might be
delighted, and that she might not grievef (Al-Qasas
28:13)
He never suckled from any woman, despite that he was of
the age of suckling! This was from the perfection of Allah's
power and the truthfulness of His promise, because Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, said to her:

cast him into the river and fear not, nor grieve. Verily!
We shall bring him back to you, and shall make him one
of (Our) M essengers(A l-Q asas 28:7)
No one can imagine the degree of a mother's affection for
her child. Now, it was said to her: "Put your baby in a box
and cast it into the river, he will soon come back to you” . If
not for faith that this woman had, she would not have done
this! To cast her son into the river! Even if he accidentally
fell off from his cradle into the river, it would disturb her,
so what about her throwing him in it? But because of her
trust in the Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, and His
promise, she cast him into the river.
Concerning His statement: $that you may be produced

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

under Our E ye} in the singular form, does this contradict
what preceded about its plural form? The answer is that
it does not contradict it. The reason for that, is because
the singular in the genitive case conveys a general sense,
it therefore includes whatever is affirmed for Allah
concerning Eyes. Hence, there is no contradiction be­
tween the singular, and the plural, or the dual.
Therefore, it remains, how do we harmonize between the
plural and the dual? The response is that if the least
number considered to be plural is two, then there is no
contradiction, because we will say this plural refers to the
dual, so it will not contradict it. But if the least number
considered to be plural is three, then, three (as a number) is
not intended by this plural. What is intended by it is
exaltation, and to conform between the pronoun of the
plural, and the genitive.
The people of Tahrif and Ta'til have interpreted the Eye to
mean "looking" without Eye; they said: }U n der Our Eyes}
means "while We are watching you" but there is no eye.
It is never possible to affirm the eye for Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, because the eye is a part of the
body. So if we affirm an eye for Allah, we have, by that,
affirmed parts and a body for Him; and this is impos­
sible. He only mentioned eye to stress that He is watch­
ing. Meaning "as if we are watching you, and for Us is
an eye." And the case is not like that!
So we reply them, this saying is erroneous for various
reasons:
Firstly: It opposes the apparentness of the expression.
Secondly: It opposes the consensus of the Salaf (pious
predecessors).
Thirdly: There is no evidence for it; that is, that the

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

423

meaning of Eye is only "watching.”
Fourthly: If we say it merely refers to "w atching" while
Allah affirmed an Eye for Himself, that will necessarily
imply that He sees with that Eye; therefore, there is
evidence in the Ayah that it is an eye, in reality.

The Attribute of Hearing and Seeing of Allah, the
Exalted

The Commentary
The author, may Allah have Mercy upon him, mentioned
seven Ayat regarding the affirmation of the two Attributes
of hearing and seeing.
The first Ayah: His statement:

'o\
^Indeed Allah has heard the statement o f her that
disputes with you concerning her husband, and com­
plains to Allah. And Allah hears the argument between

424

Commentary on A l-A qidah Al-Wasitiyyah

you both. Verily, Allah is Sami'un, Basirun'f (AlMujadilah 58:1)
Al-Mujadilah refers to the woman who came to the Prophet
S& to complain against her husband, who had declared AzZihar upon her.
Az-Zihar is when a man says to his wife: "You are to me,
like the back of my mother” or words similar to that. AzZihar, during the period of Jdhiliyyah, was considered a
form of irrevocable divorce. So, she came to Messenger of
Allah
to complain against her husband, and explained
how the man divorced her with that irrevocable divorce,
while she was the mother of his children. While she was
conferring with the Prophet #|, meaning - she was going
over the matter repeatedly with him, Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, gave her the verdict that is contained in the Ayah
mentioned.
The proof in this Ayah is His statement:

4 Indeed Allah has heard the statement o f her that
disputes with youfy
In this is the affirmation of hearing for Allah, Glorified and
Exalted is He; and that He hears voices, regardless of how
far away, or hidden they are.
'Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said: "Blessed is
He (or she said: "Praise be to Allah") whose hearing
encompasses every voice. I was on the other side of the
house, and some of her discussion was hidden from
m e ."^ This is the meaning of her narration.
And the hearing, which is attributed to Allah, the Mighty

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

and Sublime, is divided into two categories:
1. Hearing that deals with what is heard. Its meaning will,
therefore be; reaching the sounds.
2. Hearing that has the meaning of response. So its
meaning is that Allah answers whomever calls upon
Him, because the supplication is a voice that issues
from the supplicator, and Allah hears his supplication.
Meaning — He responds to his supplication. The
menaing is not merely hearing, since there is no benefit
in this; rather the benefit is in Allah responding to the
supplication.
The hearing which means reaching the sounds, is divided
into three categories:
The First: That which is intended to threaten.
The Second: That which is intended to show aid and
support.
The Third: That which is intended to explain the allencompassing knowledge of Allah, Glorious and Exalted is
He.
1.

As for what is intended to threaten; an example of it is
in His statement, Exalted is He:

40 r do they think that We hear not their secrets and
their private counsel?$ (Az-Zukhruf 43:80)
And His statement:

4 Indeed, Allah has heard the statement of those (Jews)
who say: "Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!"$ (Al
'Imran 3:181)

426

2.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

As for that which is intended to express aid and
support, an example of it is His statement, Exalted is
He, to Musa and Harun:
Li===ljn
4 Verily! I am with you both, hearing and s e e i n g ( T a
Ha 20:46)

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, intended to support Musa
and Harun by mention of Him being with them, hearing
and seeing. That is, He would hear what both of them say,
and what is said to both of them, and He saw them, and the
one to whom they were sent; what they were doing, and
what was being done to them.
3.

As for that which is intended to express the allencompassing knowledge of Allah; an example is in
this Ayah, and that is:

o f those (Jews) who say: "Truly, Allah is poor and we

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

427

The Second Ayah: His statement:

} Indeed, Allah has heard the statement o f those (Jews)
who s a y : "Truly, Allah is poor and we are rich!" } (Al
'Imran 3:181)
Those who said: }T ru ly, Allah is poor and we are rich} are
the Jews, may Allah destroy them! They described Allah
with imperfection, saying: "Truly, Allah is poor."
The reason they said this, is that when He, Exalted is He,
revealed His statement:

}W ho is he that will lend to Allah a goodly loan so that
He may multiply it to him many tim es?} (Al-Baqarah
2:245)
They said to the Messenger
"O Muhammad, your Lord
is needy, He is asking for loans from us."

}O r do they think that We hear not their secrets and
their private counsel? O f course! And Our Messengers
are by them, to record.} (Az-Zukhruf 43:80) iV erily! I

}D oes he not know that Allah does see?} (Al-'Alaq
96:14)

428

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The Third A y a h : His statement:

fa ip * &

4 0 r do they think that We hear not their secrets and
their private counsel? O f course! And Our Messengers
are by them, to record4 (Az-Zukhruf 43:80)
❖

A s-Sirr (the secret): What someone confides in his
companion. An-Najwa (the private counsel): What he is
discussing privately and talking to his companion
about. It is louder than the secret. An-Nada (the call): is
when one raises his voice for his companion.

So these are three things: the secret, the private counsel and
the call.
For example, if someone sits beside you and you are talking
to him secretly such that none else hears you, this is a
secret. But if the discussion is among a group of people,
wherein all of them hear and participate in the discussion,
this is referred to as a private counsel. But as for a call, it
occurs between two people who are far from each other.
These people were secretly talking about disobedience; and
holding a council about that; so, Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, threatened them:

#Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and
their private counsel? O f course!}
4 O f course^ (Bala): It is a word of reply, meaning: "O f
course We hear them” and adding to that;
4o p O

4And Our Messengers are by them, to record4

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

429

That is, they were with them, recording what they were
doing in secret, and what they said in their private counsel.
The meaning of "M essengers” here is the Angels, who are
responsible for recording the deeds of the sons of Adam.
In this Ayah is affirmation that Allah hears their secrets and
private counsels.
The Fourth A yah:

4 Verily! I am with you both, hearing and seeing} (Td
Ha 20:46)
The address was directed to Musa and Harun, peace be
upon them. Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, was telling
them: $ Verily! I am with you both, hearing and seeing}.
Meaning, I hear what you both say, and I hear what is
said to you. And I see you, and I see the one to whom I
sent you. I see what you do, and I see what is done to
you. This is because they were treated badly, verbally or
physically; if it is verbal, Allah hears it; and if it is
physical, it is seen by Allah.
The Fifth A yah: His statement:

}D oes he not know that Allah does see?} (Al-'Alaq 96:14)
The pronoun in }Know s he n ot} refers to the one who was
trying to harm the Prophet
according to His
statement:

430

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

}H ave you seen him who prevents, a slave when he
prays? Tell me, if he is upon the guidance? Or enjoins
Taqwa? Tell me if he belies, and turns away? Does he
not know that Allah does see? } (Al-'Alaq 96:9-14)
The scholars of Tafsir have said that the one being referred
to here is Abu Jahl.^
In this Ayah, there is the affirmation of the Attribute of
seeing (Ar-Ru'yah) for Allah, Exalted is He. The Ru'yah
attributed to Allah has two meanings:
The First M eaning: Knowledge.
The Second M eaning: Seeing whatever is visible. That is
reaching it with sight.
An example of the first meaning, is in His statement,
Exalted is He, concerning the Day of Resurrection:

i Verily! They see it afar off. But We see it (quite) near}
(Al-Ma'drij 70:6-7)
So the Ar-Ru'yah here, is the Ar-Ru'yah of knowledge; since
the Day is not a physical thing that can be seen, and also at
the same time not far off. Therefore, the meaning of }B u t
We see it (quite) near} is We know it is near.
❖

[1]

As for His saying: }D oes he not know that He does
see?}, it can be considered to mean knowledge, or
the act of the seeing of vision. If it is good to be
considered for both, and there is no contradiction
between them, then it is required that it be consid­
ered to apply to both fo them. So, it should be said:
"Verily, Allah sees” that is, He knows what this man
See A d -D u rr A l-M a n th u r (6:626).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

431

was doing, and and He also saw him.

iW h o sees you when you stand. And your movements
among those who fall prostrate. Verily! He, only He, is
As-SamC, Al-'AUmi (Ash-Shura 26:218-220) iA n d
s a y : "Do deeds! Allah will see your deeds, and (so will)
His Messenger and the believers"i (At-Tawbah 9:105)

The Sixth A yah: His Statement:

iW h o sees you when you stand. And your movements
among those who fall prostrate. Verily! He, only He, is
As-Sami , Al-'Alim$ (Ash-Shura 26:218-220)
❖

Before this Ayah, there is:

iA n d rely upon the All-Mighty, the Most M ercifuli
(Ash-Shura 26:217)
❖

The Ru'yah here is the seeing of vision. Because in His
statement:

iW lio sees you when you stan di

432

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

— it is not correct that it would mean knowledge, since
Allah knows about him before and after he had stood. And
also because of His statement:

4 And your movements among those who fall prostrate)>;
it corroborates that the meaning here is the Ru'yah of
vision.
❖

The meaning of the Ayah is that Allah, Exalted is He,
sees him when he stands in Salah alone, and when he
motions among those who prostrate in the congrega­
tional Salah.

❖

<$Verily He, only He, is As-Sami', Al-'Alimy. meaning Allah is the One who sees you when you stand: $H e,
is As-Sami', Al-'Alimfy

In this Ayah, there is pronoun in apposition (He); part of its
benefit is to express restriction. So, is the restriction here
absolute or relative? That is, is it a restriction in such a way
that the quality found in the element being restricted
cannot be found in any other, or is it just relative?
The answer: It is relative in a way and absolute in another
way, because the meaning of ^As-Samf^ here, is the
possessor of perfect hearing, which reaches all that is
audible. This is specifically for Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime.
The restriction with this usage is a reality. But for hearing
in general, it can be possessed by a human, as it is
contained in His statement:

4 Verily, We have created man from Nutfah (drops o f
mixed discharge o f man and woman), in order to try

Commentary On The Introductory Notes.

him, so We made him hearer, seer f

433

(Al-lnsan 76:2)

So, Allah, Exalted is He, made the human being a hearer
and seer. And like that; 4 'Alim}; because man is also
knowledgeable, as Allah, Exalted is He, said:

4And they gave him glad tidings o f an intelligent son,
having knowledge4 (Adh-Dhariyat 51:28)
But absolute knowledge, that is; the perfect knowledge - it
is specifically Allah's, Glorified and Exalted is He. There­
fore, the restriction with this usage a reality.
In this Ayah, there is a combination of the mention of
hearing and seeing.
The Seventh Ayah: His statement:

4And say: "Do deeds! Allah will see your deeds, and
(so will) His Messenger and the believers"4 (At-Tawbah
9:105)
What comes before this Ayah is:

4Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to
purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah
fo r them. Verily! Your invocations are a source o f
security fo r them, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.
Know they not that Allah accepts repentance from His
slaves and takes the Sadaqat (alms, charities) and that

434

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Allah Alone is the One Who forgives and accepts
repentance, Most M erciful? } (.At-Tawbah 9:103-104)
❖

He says in the Ayah:

4 . . . Allah will see your deeds, and (so will) His
Messenger and the believers}
Ibn Kathir and others said, "Mujahid said: 'This is a
threat''' - that is from Allah, Exalted is He, - "to those who
disobeyed His commands, that their deeds shall be exposed
to Him and to the Messenger and the believers. This will
happen definitely on the Day of Resurrection. Allah may
even expose that to people in this world."
Here, the Ru'yah includes both that of knowledge and of
vision.
So in this Ayah, there is an affirmation of the Ru'yah with
both meanings: The R u’yah of knowledge, and the Ru'yah
of vision.
A Summary of what Preceded Regarding the Two
Attributes of Hearing and Seeing
❖

That the hearing is divided into two categories:

1.
2.

Hearing that means responding.
Hearing that means to reach the sounds.

And that reaching sounds is of three categories.
❖

And like that, the Ru'yah (seeing) is divided into two
categories:

1.
2.

Seeing with the meaning of knowledge.
Seeing with the meaning of reaching what is visible.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

435

All of these are affirmed for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime
The Ru’yah which has the meaning of reaching what is
visible, is divided into three categories:
— A category which is intended to express aid and
support, such as His statement:

} Verily! I am with you both, hearing and seein g .} (Ta
Ha 20:46)
—A category which is intended to show the all-encom­
passing knowledge of Allah, such as His statement:

}V erily , how excellent is the teaching which He (Allah)
gives you! Truly, Allah is Ever AUAll (An-Nisa 4:58)
— A category intended to express threat, such as His
statement:

i S a y : "Present no excuses, we shall not believe you.
Allah has already informed us o f the news concerning
you. Allah and His Messenger will see your deeds"}
(At-Tawbah 9:94)
What behavioral benefits we derive from the Attributes of
hearing and seeing:
As for the Attribute of Ru'yah (seeing), by having faith in
that, we will benefit from fear and hope: Fear in the face of
disobedience; because Allah is looking at us. And hope at
the time of obedience; because Allah is looking at us. There
is no doubt that He shall reward us for this, hence, our

436

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

determination for His obedience will grow stronger, while
our want to disobey Him will weaken.
As for the Attribute of hearing, the matter regarding it is
obvious; since if a person believes in Allah's hearing (him),
it necessitates that he believes in Allah's perfect supervision
over whatever he says, with fear and hope. Having fear, he
would not utter anything evil which Allah, Exalted is He,
will hear from him; and with hope, he will utter the
statements which Allah, Exalted is He, is pleased with.

And His saying: 4And He is Severe in Al-Mihal^ (ArRa'd 13:13) iA n d they (disbelievers) plotted and Allah
planned too. And Allah is the Best o f the p la n n e r s ( A l
'Imran 3:54)

•

Affirmation of Attribute of Al-Makar, Al-Kaid and AlMihal for Allah, the Exalted

The Commentary
The author, may Allah have Mercy upon him, mentioned
three synonymous Attributes, in four Ayat. They are: AlMihal, Al-Makar and Al-Kaid.
The first Ayah: Concerns Al-Mihal, and it is His saying:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

437

’{And. He is Severe in A l-M ihal{ (Ar-Ra'd 13:13)
That is, He is severe in punishment. And it is said that
Mihal means to plot (Al-Makar), meaning - strong in
plotting. It appears as if based on this interpretation, the
word is considered to be derived from Al-Htlah (ploy), and
that is to plan a trap for one's opponent until he falls into it.
This meaning is apparently what the author, may Allah
have Mercy upon him, meant, since he mentioned it
alongside the Ayat concerning Al-Makar and Al-Kaid.
Al-Makar; the scholars said its interpretation, is to inflict
harm on the opponent by taking secret steps toward
achieving that. Meaning - that you take some secret steps in
order to inflict harms on your enemy while he does not
perceive; but to you, it was known and deliberate.
Al-Makar can be commendable in a situation, and condemnable in another; if it is against one who also hatches
up a plot, it is commendable because that will suggest that
you are stronger than he is. But in other cases, it is
condemnable, and it is called treachery. That is why Allah
never described H im self w ith it except by way of
expressing opposition and with restriction, as He, Exalted
is He, says:

{S o they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while
they perceived n ot{ (An-Naml 27:50)

{T hey were plotting and Allah too was planning{ (AlAnfdl 8:30)
But Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, is not described with
it in a general way, one does not say: "A llah is a plotter

438

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

(Makir)," not by way of giving information, nor by the way
of calling Him that. It should not also be said: "Allah is a
Ka'id (secret plotter)” not by way of giving information, nor
by way of calling Him such. For this meaning can
sometimes be commendable and sometimes condemnable.
So, it is not possible that we describe Allah with it in an
unrestricted way.
But, as for His statement, Exalted is He:

4.And Allah is the Best o f the planners^ (Al 'Imran 3:54)
This is a form of perfection. That is why He did not say: “I
plot against the plotters”; He rather said: "And Allah is the
Best of those who plot” . Therefore, His plot will not be
except goodness. That is why it is correct that we describe
Him with that, and say: "H e is the Best of those who plot;”
or that we describe Him with the Attribute of plotting by
expressing His opposition. That is, His opposition against
whoever plots against Him. So, we say: "Allah, Exalted is
He, is a plotter against those who plot” based on His
statement, Exalted is He:

iT h ey were plotting, and Allah too was planning.$ (AlAnfdl 8:30)
The second A yah: Concerns the Attribute of Al-Makar
and that is His statement:

4And they (disbelievers) plotted and Allah planned too.
And Allah is the Best o f the planners$ (Al 'Imran 3:54)

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4 So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while
they perceived nofy (An-Naml 27:50)
This was concerning the people of Salih. In the city where
he was inviting people to Allah, there were nine groups:

4 They said: "Swear one to another by Allah that we
shall make a secret night attack on him and his
household"4 (An-Naml 27:49)
Meaning to kill him, during the night.

4 "And afterwards we will surely say to his near relatives:
‘We witnessed not the destruction o f his household, and
verily! We are telling the truth" f (An-Naml 27:49)
Meaning, that they would kill him during the night, but
they did not witness it. But they plotted and Allah also
plotted. It was said that when they went out to kill him,
they headed to a cave, awaiting the night therein. Then, the
cave closed up upon them, and they perished in it, while no
harm touched Salih and his household. Allah says:

4 So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan4 (AnNaml 27:50)
❖

Makran in both places is an indefinite, used to express
greatness, meaning - they plotted a great plot, while
We plotted a greater plot.

The Fourth Ayah : Concerns Al-Kaid, and that is His
statement:

iV erily , they are hut plotting a plot. And I (too) am
planning a plan } (At-Tariq 86:15-16)
❖

^Verily, they} that is the disbelievers of Makkah 4 are
plottingf against the Messenger
4a plot4, there
was nothing like it (their plot) to drive people away
from him and his call, but Allah, Exalted is He, also
plotted a plan, much greater, more calculative, and
more accurate.

❖

4And I (too) am planning4 meaning; "a plot greater
than their plot". Allah mentioned some of their plots,
and secret plans, in Surat Al-Anfal. He says:

4And (remember) when the disbelievers plotted against
you to hold you, or to kill you, or to expel you4 (AlAnfal 8:30)
Three opinions:[1]
1.
2.
3.

}T o hold you4 - meaning, to imprison you.
}T o kill y ou } - meaning, to exterminate you.
4To expel y ou } - meaning, to banish you.

The opinion of killing him was the best to them, with the
advice of Iblis, because Iblis came to them in the form of an
old man from Najd. He said to them: "Choose ten young
men from ten clans of the Quraish, and give each of them a
sword. Then, they should all head toward Muhammad and
kill him all at once. In this way, his blood would be placed
on all the clans, then the children of Hashim will not be
able to kill any of these young men. Hence, they will resort
to collecting the blood-money, and by that you will be free

442

from him.” They said: "This is a marvelous opinion. They
all agreed upon that.” 111
But they were plotting a plot, while Allah, Exalted is He,
was also plotting what was better than that.
He, Exalted is He, said:

}T hey were plotting and Allah too was planning, and
Allah is the Best o f the planners} (Al-Anfdl 8:30)
They never achieved what they desired, the Messenger sg
rather left his house, scattering dust on the heads of these
ten, while reciting:

1 ' > •*
}A n d We have put a barrier before them, and a barrier
behind them, and We have covered them up, so that
they cannot see} (Yd Sin 36:9)
They were anticipating the Messenger #£ to go out; but he
left, while they perceived not.121 Therefore, the plot became
stronger than theirs, because Allah rescued His Messenger
from them and he emigrated.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

443

iV erily, they are but plotting a plot. And I (too) am
planning a plan$ (At-Tariq 86:15-16)
The indefinite form is used here to express greatness. And
the plot of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is stronger than
their plot.
In that manner Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, plans for
whomever supports His religion, for He shall plan for him,
and aid him. Allah, Exalted is He, said:

iT h u s did We plan fo r Yusufy (Yusuf 12:76)
Meaning: We did that by which his purpose was achieved
while no one perceived it. This is from Allah's grace upon a
man; to save him from the evil of his enemy by way of
plotting against this enemy who desired to inflict harm
upon him.
If you say: "W hat is the definition of Al-Makar, Al-Kaid, and
Al-Mihdl?"
The Response: Their definition according to the scholars, is
the act of hatching secret plans in order to attack the
opponent; meaning, that you trap your opponent via
hidden plans while he knows not. It is commendable if it is
done under the right circumstances, and it is an attribute of
imperfection that is condemnable when it is done under
other than the right circumstances.
It was has been mentioned, that when 'All bin Abi Talib,
may Allah be pleased with him, wanted to engage 'Amr
bin Wadd in a duel - the benefit of a duel is that when one
of the two defeats the other, the hearts of his enemies will
break up - when 'Amr appeared, 'All shouted: "I did not

444

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

come out to fight two people". Then 'Amr turned round.
When he had turned around, 'All, may Allah be pleased
with him, hit him on his knee until he brought down his
head! ^
This was a trick, but it is permissible and commendable
because it was in the proper circumstances. This man did
not come out to honor 'All bin Abi Talib nor to congratulate
him, but he came out in order to kill him, and 'All hatched
a plot against him.
Al-M akar, Al-Kaid, and Al-M ihal, are among A llah's
attributes of doing, which He is not described with in an
unrestricted way, for they are sometimes commendable
and sometimes condemnable.
He is to be described with them in the situation when it will
be commendable, and not when they are not condemnable.
It should be said: "Allah is the Best of those who plot, He is
the Best of those who plan;" or it should be said: "Allah is a
Plotter against the plotters, He Deceives the one who tries
to deceive Him."
Mockery also belongs to this category. It is not correct to
describe Allah as mocking, in an unrestricted way, because
mockery is a form of jest, and it should be negated from
Allah. Allah, Exalted is He, says:

4And We created not the heavens and the earth, and all
that is between them, fo r mere p lay } (Ad-Dukhan 44:38)
But, in opposition to one who mocks at Him, it will be
perfection; as He, Exalted is He, says:
^

See Silsilat Al-Ahadith Ad-Da'ifah (1:775 - the new edition
Maktabat Al-Ma'arif) by Shaikh Al-Albanl.

iA n d when they meet those who believe, they s a y : “We
believe," but when they are alone with their Shayatin,
they say: "Truly, we are with you ; verily, we were but
m o c k i n g (Al-Baqarah 2:14)
Then, Allah said:

i^Allah mocks at them^ (Al-Baqarah 2:15)
The People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah affirm these
meanings for Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, as reality. But
the people of Tahrif say it is never possible to describe Allah
with them; that the mention of Allah's plot and their plot, is
just mere literal resemblance, the meaning is different, such as:

iA llah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with
Him$ (.Al-M aidah 5:119)
W e are saying to them: "This is contrary to the apparent­
ness of the text, and it is contrary to the consensus of the
Salaf (pious predecessors)."
Earlier, we stated, that if someone were to say: "Bring us a
statement from Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthman or 'All, saying:
'The meaning of Al-Makar, Al-Kaid, mocking, and deceiv­
ing, is a reality."
We say to them: "Yes, they recited the Qur'an, and
believed in it. The fact that they did not alter this meaning
that quickly comes to mind, to another one, shows that
they acknowledged it, and that this is a consensus; that is
why it suffices us to say that there is a consensus on it.

446

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Nothing that opposes the apparentness of the statement
has ever been reported from anyone of them, nor that he
interpreted pleasure to mean reward, or Al-Kaid to mean
punishment...” and the like.
Perhaps someone raises confusion among us, saying: "You
are saying that this is the consensus of the Salaf (pious
predecessors)? Where is their consensus (stated or re­
corded)?” We say: "The absence of reports from them that
are contrary to the apparentness of it, is an evidence of the
consensus.”
W h at we D eriv e o f B e h a v io ra l B e n e fits by the
Affirm ation of the Attributes of Al-Makar, Al-Kaid, and
Al-Mihal
A l-M akar: A person will derive the behavioral benefit of
remembering that Allah, Glorious and Exalted is He, is
always watching Him, and he will not plan to do what is
unlawful, and how many plot to do what is unlawful! So
these people who plot to do the unlawful, when they know
that Allah, the Exalted is better at plotting then they are,
and quicker in plotting than them, that will make them
stop such plots.
Sometimes, someone might be doing something, which to
people, appears perm issible but to Allah, it is not
permissible. In this situation, he will fear Allah, and be
cautious (of disobeying Him).
There are many examples of such matters, in business
transactions, and marriage, and other than that.
An example of that in business; suppose a man comes to
another and says: "Lend me ten thousand Dirhams" and
the other says: "I will not lend it to you unless I collect
twelve thousand in return.” This is Riba and it is unlawful.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

447

So he avoids this because he knows that this is clearly Riba.
But suppose he sells him some goods for twelve thousand
Dirhams, on deferred payment, over a year, and a
document for that is written between them. Then, later
the seller goes to the buyer and says: "sell it back to me for
ten thousand in cash." Then he (the buyer) says: "I sell it to
you" and they write a document of business transaction
between them.
Apparently, this business transaction is valid; but we say:
"This is a fraud"; because this man (the first seller) knows
that it is not allowed for him to give him ten thousand in
exchange for twelve thousand. So he said: "I will sell this
merchandise to him for twelve thousand, and buy it back
from him for ten thousand in cash."
Over time, one can continue in this kind of transaction,
since to people it is a kind of transaction that does not have
any problem, but before Allah, it is a form of deception
involving what He has made unlawful. Allah, Exalted is
He, is watching this wrong doer, so that when He seizes
him, he will not release him. Meaning, He will leave him
while his wealth is increasing and progressing with this
Riba; but when He seizes him, He will not release him.
After that, all of these things will become a loss for him,
and he will end up being bankrupt. One of the statements
common upon the tongue of the people is: "W hoever
engages in fraudulent dealings, he ends up being a
pauper."
An example in the matter of marriage; is a case of a woman
that has been divorced three times, then she is not
permissible for the husband again until she has married
and divorced another man. In order to facilitate things for
the first husband, a friend of his is then contracted to marry
this woman with the condition (between the two men) that

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

448

once the second man has had sexual intercourse with her,
he will divorce her. Then, he does that. So he marries her
properly in the presence of witnesses, and he also gave her
a Mahr, and consummated the marriage, and then divorced
her. When he divorced her, she started the waiting period,
after which, the first husband married her. Apparently, it is
lawful for her to marry the first husband, but in reality she
is not lawful for him, because this is a form of deception.
Whenever we know that Allah, the Most High, is quicker in
plotting, and that Allah is the Best of those who plot, that
will make us stay far away from attempting to be deceitful
with what Allah has made unlawful.

The Commentary

449

four Ayat concerning the Attributes of Pardon, Power,
Forgiveness, Mercy and Honor (Al-'Izzah).
The first Ayah: Is concerning the Attributes of Al-'Afu.
(pardon) and Al-Qudrah (power). His statement:

4 Whether you disclose a good deed, or conceal it, or
pardon an evil; verily, Allah is 'Afuwwan Qadir$ (AnNisa' 4:149)
M eaning: If you do a good deed and disclose it to people
or 4 conceal ify from the people; indeed, Allah, Exalted is
He, knows of it; nothing can be hidden from Him.
And in another Ayah:

4 Whether you reveal anything or conceal it, verily,
Allah is 'Allman (Knower) o f everything4 (Al-Ahzdb
33:54)
This is more comprehensive. It includes the good and bad,
and what is not good or bad. Each Ayah has its importance
and area of suitability for the one who ponders it.
❖

Concerning His statement: $O r pardon an evil4
Pardon (Al-'Afu) is to overlook giving punishment. If
somebody does an evil to you, and you pardon him,
indeed Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, knows of
that. But pardoning, to be praiseworthy for the
pardoner, has the condition that it be combined with
reconciliation, because of His statement, Exalted is
He:

450

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

}B u t whoever forgives and makes reconciliation, his
reward is due from A llah} (Ash-Shura 42:40)
The reason for that is that pardon may be a cause of
additional oppression and hostility, or it may be a cause to
end that, without any increase nor decrease in transgression.
1.

2.

3.

When it is a cause that increases transgression, then
pardon in such case is blameworthy; it can even be
prohibited. Such as when we pardon a criminal, and
we know - or we have a strong suspicion - that he will
go and commit greater crime. In this case, the one
pardoning will not be commended for doing that, he
would rather be condemned for it.
Pardon can lead to the end of hostility. That is, if the
pardoned person becomes ashamed, and says: "This
person that pardoned me, it is not possible that I
transgress against him another time, nor anyone else."
So he is ashamed to be the transgressor. The one that
pardoned will be considered among those worthy to
pardon, so pardoning here is comm endable and
recommended. It may even be compulsory.
Then, pardon may not have any effect, neither increase
nor decrease; then this is what is best, based on His
statement, Exalted is He:

}A n d to pardon is nearer to At-Taqw a} (Al-Baqarah
2:237)
❖

Here, He, Exalted is He, says:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

451

4 0 r pardon an evil; verily, Allah is 'Afuwwan, Q adir}
{An-Nisa’ 4:149)
Meaning when you pardon an evil, Allah will pardon you.
We derive this ruling from the subordinate clause: ^ Verily,
Allah is ’Afuwwan, Qadir} - meaning that, He will pardon
you despite the fact that He can take vengeance upon
you. And He, Exalted is He, combined here between
pardon and power, because the perfection of pardon lies
in the fact that it is out of power. As for the pardon that
accrues out of weakness, the one who does this will not
be com m ended, because he is incapable of taking
revenge. As for the pardon that is not combined with
power, it can be commended, but it is not perfect
pardon. Rather, perfect pardon is that which is done out
of power.
That is why Allah, Exalted is He, combined between these
two names: A l-’Afuw and Al-Qadir.
So A l-’Afuw is the One Who overlooks the evil deeds of His
servants. What is common is that A l-’Afuw (pardon) is for
forsaking an obligation, while Al-Maghfirah (forgiveness) is
for commission of a prohibited act.
Al-Qadir: The Possessor of power. It is an attribute with
which a doer will be able to perform an action, without any
incapability.
These two Names comprise two Attributes, and they are
A l-’Afuw and Al-Qudrah.
The second A yah: Concerning Al-Maghfirah (forgiveness)
and Ar-Rahmah (mercy). His statement:

i^Let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that

452

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Ghafurun
Rahim^ (An-Niir 24:22)
This Ayah was revealed concerning Abu Bakr, may Allah
be pleased with him, and that was because Mistah bin
Uthathah, may Allah be pleased with him, who was the
son of Abu Bakr's maternal aunt (his second cousin), and
he was among those that were spreading the slander.
The story of the s l a n d e r , i s that some people among the
hypocrites attacked the honor of 'Aishah, may Allah be
pleased with her. By Allah, their focus was not to attack the
personality of 'Aishah primarily, but their focus was to
attack and tarnish the honor of the Messenger of Allah jjj|.
They intended to cause confusion concerning his bed, and
cast him into ignominy, may Allah forbid! But, and to Allah
is the praise, Allah exposed their evil intentions and plans,
and disgraced them! He said:
t>\% A t+rt AAt u lj*

4;And as for him among them who had the greater share
therein, his will be a great torment4 (An-Niir 24:11)
They attacked her personality, and the majority of those
who were involved in this were the hypocrites, while a
group of the righteous Companions were also involved.
Among them was Mistah bin Uthathah. This act is one of
the greatest means of severing the ties of kinship - that one
should disparage his relation, particularly as this was
concerning the Mother of the Believers, the wife of the
Messenger of Allah
Reacting on this, Abu Bakr vowed
to stop providing for him.
The story of Al-Ifk (the slander) is reported by Al-Bukhari
(4750), (4757) and Muslim (2770) from 'Aishah, may Allah
be pleased with her.

So, Allah, Exalted is He, says:

graces and wealth swear not to give (any sort o f help) to
their kinsmen, Al-Masakin (the poor), and those who
left their homes fo r Allah's Cause} (An-Nur 24:22)
All these attributes were affirmed in the case of Mistah: He
was a relative to Abu Bakr, a poor person, and a Muhajir
(one who emigrated):

iL e t them pardon and let them forgive. Do you not love
that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Ghafurun
R ahim } (An-Nur 24:22)
Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, said (in reply to
the statement of Allah): "O yes! By Allah, we love that
Allah forgives us.” Then, he continued providing for him.
This is why the Ayah was revealed.
❖

Concerning His statement: }L et them pardon} - it
means, "Let them overlook the sin committed against
them.”

❖

iW alyasfahu (and let them forgive)^ meaning that
they should turn away from this matter and not talk
about it (afterward). And it is taken from Safliah of
the neck, and that is its side, because when a person
turns away, what appears of him is the side of his
neck.

And the difference between Al-'Afu and As-Safh is that a
person might pardon but not forgive; afterward, he would

454

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

still be mentioning this transgression and wrong (against
him); but he would not retaliate; so, forgiveness (As-Safh) is
stronger than pardon.
❖

Concerning His statement: iD o you not love that Allah
should forgive you? y 4Do you not ^ ; is a proposition,
and its response is: "Indeed, we do love that." So, if
we love that Allah forgive us, then lets undertake the
means to the forgiveness.

❖

Then He said: iA n d Allah is Ghajurun Rahimy.
iG h a fu r i this is either considered the active subject
of a verbal clause m eant to em phasize, or an
adjective. If it is an adjective, it refers to the attribute
that is ever present and affirmed. This is what an
adjective (in the Arabic grammar) indicates. If it is
considered an active subject, it indicates that the
forgiveness often occurs from Allah.

After this, we say it combines the two. It is an adjective,
because the act of forgiveness is an eternal Attribute of
Allah, Exalted is He. It is also an action that He often does,
how often is the forgiveness of Allah, Exalted is He! How
great is it!
❖

Concerning His statement: iR a h im i, this is also an
active subject used to express emphasis. And root
noun for doer of Raham is Rahim, but it changes to
Rahim due to the great amount of Allah's Mercy, and
the great amount of those that He, the Mighty and
Sublime, has Mercy with.

Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, combined between
these two Names, because they express similar meanings.
In Al-Maghfirah (forgiveness), woes and the consequence of
sins vanish, while with Ar-Rahmah (mercy) that which is
sought is achievement; as Allah, the Exalted, said to

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

455

Paradise: "You are My mercy, I show My mercy upon
whom I will with y ou ."[1]

And His saying: iB u t Al-'Izzah belongs to Allah, His
Messenger, and to the believers$ (Al-Munafiqun 63:8)
And His saying, that Iblis said: $By Your M ight, then
I will surely mislead them all$ (Sad 38:82)

The third A yah: Regarding Al-'Izzah, and it is His saying:

iB u t Al-'Izzah belongs to Allah, His Messenger, and to
the believers^ (.Al-Munafiqun 63:8)
This Ayah was revealed in response to the statement of the
hypocrites:

4 l f we return to Al-Madinah, indeed the more honorable
(Al-A'zz) will expel the meaner} (Al-Munafiqun 63:8)
They thought that they were the most honorable, and the
Messenger of Allah and the believers were the humiliated
ones. So Allah, Exalted is He, explained that there was no
[1'

Reported by Al-Bukhan (4950) and Muslim (2846) from
Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him.

456

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

honor for them, not to talk of being the most honorable,
and that the honor belongs to Allah, His Messenger and the
believers. The meaning of the statement of the hypocrites,
was that the Messenger
and the believers were the ones
that would expel the hypocrites, because they (the
Messenger and the believers) are the people of honor,
while the hypocrites were the people of ignominy. That is
why they always thought that every cry was against them.
That was because of their ignominy and panic. Whenever
they met those who believed, they would say: "W e
believe” out of fear and cowardice, but when they were
alone with their devils, they would say: "W e are with you,
we were only mocking!” This is the utmost humiliation!
As for the believers, they are honored by their religion.
Regarding their arguing with the People of the Book, Allah
said:

iT h en , if they turn away, say: "Bear witness that we
are M uslims."^ (Al 'Imran 3:64)
They openly profess it, they do not fear the criticism of the
one who criticizes.
In this noble Ayah is the affirmation of Al-'Izzah for Allah,
Glorified and Exalted is He.
The people of knowledge mentioned that Al-'Izzah (honor)
can be categorized into three: The 'Izzah of power, the 'Izzah
of force, and the 'Izzah of protection.
1.

2.

As for the 'Izzah of power, its meaning is that Allah,
Exalted is He, is the possessor of mighty power,
meaning that he has no peer.
The 'Izzah of force is the 'Izzah of dominance; that is He dominates everything; subjugating everything. Of

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

457

its example, is His statement, Exalted is He:

$And he says: "Hand it over to
overpowered me in s p e e c h ' (Sad 38:23)

me,

and

he

Meaning he overcame me in speech. So, Allah, Exalted is
He, is Mighty, there is nothing that can overcome Him;
rather, He overwhelms everything.
3.

The 'Izzah of protection means that it is impossible that
any defect or imperfection reaches Allah, Exalted is He.

These are the meanings of 'Izzah which Allah, Exalted is
He, affirmed for Himself. It indicates the perfection of His
dominance and authority, and the perfection of His
Attributes, and to that He is absolutely free of any
imperfection.
It indicates His perfect dominance and His authority in
might and force.
It indicates completion and perfection of His Attributes,
and that there is nothing like Him in might and power.
It indicates that He is completely free of any imperfection
or defect the 'Izzah of protection.
❖

Concerning His statement: $and to His Messenger and
to the believers^ that there is 'Izzah for the Messenger
and for the believers, and dominance.

❖

However, it is compulsory that we know that the honor
Allah affirms for His Messenger and the believers is not
the same type of honor that belongs to Allah, because
the honor that belongs to the Messenger
and the
believers can be overcome by weakness, based on His
statement:

458

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4 if it

jJu, ill'

iA n d Allah has already made you victorious at Badr,
when you were a weak little force
(Al 'Imran 3:123)
It can be overcome sometimes for a wisdom which Allah,
Exalted is He, wills. In the battle of Uhud, absolute honor
did not result for them, because they were eventually
overcome for great wisdoms; the same thing at Hunain,
they fled, so that none remained with the Prophet ^ out of
the twelve thousand soldiers, except one hundred men, or
close to that number.^^ This caused honor to fade; but it is
temporary.
As for the 'Izzah of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, it can
never fade out. Based on this, we know that the honor that
Allah affirms for His Messenger and the believers is not like
the honor which He affirms of Himself.
This can also be derived from the general principle, and
that is: That when two things bear the same name, that
does not imply that those two things are completely
identical; and that two things share the same attribute, does
not imply that those two things are completely similar.
The fourth A yah: Also concerning Al-'Izzah, and it is His
saying, that Iblfs said:

iB y Your Might, then I will surely mislead them a lii
(Sad 38:82)
Iblfs chose to swear by Allah's 'Izzah, instead of other than
that of Attributes, because the situation was one trying to
overcome another. As if what he was saying is: "By your
[1]

See Fath Al-Bari (8:29).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

might with which you dominate others, I will surely
mislead these, and take control of them - that is the children
of Adam - until they leave the guided path for the wrong
path." The sincere slaves of Allah are exempt from this,
because Iblis will not be able to mislead them as He,
Exalted is He, says:

) Certainly, you shall have no authority over My
slav es.) (Al-Hijr 15:42)
So these two Ayat include the affirmation of Al-'Izzah
(Honor, Might) for Allah.
And in the second Ayah, it is affirmed that the Shaitan
acknowledges the Attributes of Allah.
Why should we find among the Children of Adam those
who deny the Attributes of Allah? Is the Shaitan then more
knowledgeable regarding Allah and much wiser than these
deniers?
The Behavioral Benefits We Derive
— Concerning Al-'Afu (pardon) and As-Safh (forgiveness),
when we know that Allah pardons, and that He is AllPowerful, that will make us always seek His pardon, and
hope for His pardon regarding whatever we neglect among
the obligations.
— As for Al-'Izzah, we say, that when we know that Allah
is All-Mighty ('Aziz), it is not possible that we do anything
by which we would be at war with Allah. For example, a
person that is involved in Riba, his action is that which
Allah is at war with:

)A n d if you do not do it, then take a notice o f war from

460

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Allah and His Messenger^ (Al-Baqarah 2:279)
When we know that Allah possesses might that can never
be overcome, then we will not advance toward what Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, is at war with. Armed robbery is
also a form of war:

iT h e recompense o f those who wage war against Allah
and His Messenger and do mischief in the land is only
that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and
their feet be cut o ff on the opposite sides, or be exiled
from the land$ (Al-Ma'idah 5:33)
If we know that armed robbery is a form of waging war
against Allah, and that the 'Izzah belongs to Allah, it will
prevent us from this act, for Allah, only He, is the AllConquering.
We can say that there is an advantage in the behavioral
aspect of this as well, and that is that a believer should
exhibit honor in matters concerning his religion, in such a
way that he does not humble himself before anybody,
whoever such a person is, except before the believers.
Therefore, he should be harsh against the unbelievers and
humble before the believers.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

That is why it is related in the Hadith: "Every noble matter
that is not begun with Bismillah, is severed (from prosperity)."[1] Meaning - nullifying the blessing.
Even saying the Bismillah makes permissible what is
prohibited without it. If someone says Bismillah at the time
of slaughtering, an animal becomes permissible to eat, if it
is not said, that animal becomes prohibited and dead flesh.
There is a difference between what is permissible, good and
pure, and the dead animal, the impure animal and the
offensive animal.
If someone says Bismillah at the time of purifying himself
from minor impurity (such as performing Wudu') it is valid;
if he does not say Bismillah, it is not valid, according to one
of the two opinions.
If someone says Bismillah at the time of eating, the Shaitan
would not eat with him; if he does not say it, he (the
Shaitan) eats with him.
If someone says Bismillah at the time of having intercourse,
and says: "O Allah, keep the Shaitan away from us, and
from what you provide for us,” [2] then if a child is decreed
for them, the Shaitan will never be able to harm him.
Hence, we say: Tabarak here does not convey the meaning
of "H e is exalted” or "H e is proud”, rather, it is compulsory
This Hadith is reported by different wordings and taking
the versions together indicates that it is Hasan or Sahih LiGhairihi and more than one of the Imams have said it is
Sahih, while others consider it to have deficiencies. See
Musnad Al-Imam Ahmad edited by Ahmad Shakir (8697)
and Sahih Ibn Hibban bi Tartib Ibn Balban edited by Shu'aib
Al-Ama'ut (1:173) and Irwa Al-Ghalil (1 and 2).
Reported by Al-Bukhari (3271) and Muslim (1434) from
Ibn 'Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.

that its meaning is; abundant blessing are with Allah's
Name; that is, His Name is the cause of abundant blessing
when it accompanies something.
And, concerning His statement:

}Dhil-Jalali wal-Ikram (the Owner o f Majesty and
H onor)} (Ar-Rahman 55:78)
❖

}D h i} meaning owner, and it is a description of the
Lord, not the Name. If it were a description of the
Name, it would be: Dhu.

❖

}A l-Jalal}: meaning magnificence.

❖

iw al-Ikram } meaning "H onor". It is proper, because
honor can be from Allah to the one who obeys Him,
and from the one who obeys Him, to Him.

So, }A l-Jalal} is His magnificence, Himself, and }w alIkrdm } is His magnificence in the hearts of the believers,
so they honor Him, and He honors them.

}S o worship Him, and be constant and patient in His
worship. Do you know o f any who is similar to H im ?}
(Maryam 19:65)

#

The Ayat of the Attributes of Negation (Al-Manfiyyah)
Concerning the Exaltation of Allah and the Negation of
any Equal from Him:

464

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The Commentary
The first Ayah: His statement:

4 So worship Hun, and be constant and patient in His
worship. Do you know o f any who is similar to H im ?*
(Maryam 19:65)
The author
began with the Attributes of negation. It has
earlier been discussed that the Attributes of Allah, Exalted
is He, are affirmative and negative; that is negation because
perfection will not be ascertained except with affirmation
and negation: Affirmation of the perfect attributes and
negation of those that are imperfect.
❖

Concerning His statement: 4 So worship Him, and be
constant and patient in His w orshipi, this follows what
preceded; His statement:

iL ord o f the heavens and the earth, and all that is
between them4 (Maryam 19:65)
So He, Glorious and Exalted is He, mentioned His
Rububiyyah (Lordship):

iL ord o f the heavens and the earth, and all that is
between them .4 (Maryam 19:65)
And then, based upon that, He explained that it is
obligatory to worship Him; since all who acknowledge
the Lordship, it necessitates that they affirm the Al'Ubudiyyah (worship), and Al-Uluhiyyah (divinity) or else,
it becomes contradictory.

Commentary On The Introductory Notes.

465

So, His statement: iS o worship Him)*, that is — subjugate
yourself to Him, with love and reverence. And worship:
what is intended by it, is that with which worship is
performed, and the act of worship, which is the action of
the slave, as had preceded in the introductory notes.
❖

Concerning His statement: iA n d be constant and
patienti: Istabir; its root in the language is Istabir, so
the Ta was replaced by the Ta due to inflection.
And As-Sabr means confinement of the soul, and the
word Istabir is more emphatic and expressive than
Isbar, for it expresses endurance and tolerance. There­
fore, its meaning is "be patient even if that is harsh
upon you; and persevere in the way that one will
against an opponent while fighting.”

❖

Concerning His statement: iD o you know o f any who is
similar to Him?y. The interrogative here is intended to
negate. If the interrogative is used to convey nega­
tion, it also carries the meaning of a challenge.
Meaning, if you are truthful, then inform me: "Do
you know of any who is similar to Him?” That is do you know of any who is like Him, who deserves
what He deserves?

The answer is no. So when that is the case, then it is
compulsory that you worship Him alone.
Among the Attributes in it; He said: iD o you know o f any
who is similar to H im ?i and this is one of the Attributes
of negation.
What does it consist of in terms of the Attributes of
perfection, for we have mentioned in what preceded, that
the Attributes of negation must necessarily imply an
affirmation. What is the affirmation which it includes here?
The answer is: Absolute perfection. The meaning will

466

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

therefore be: Do you know of any similar to Him, in His
absolute perfection, in which nobody is similar to Him?

And His saying: 4And there is none co-equal or
comparable unto Him)* (Al-Ikhlas 112:4) And His
saying: 477icn do not set up rivals unto Allah while
you know4 (Al-Baqarah 2:22)

The second A yah:

4And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him4
{Al-Ikhlds 112:4)
The discussion about this preceded. It means, nothing is
equal to Him. It is an indefinite pronoun used in the context
of negation, it, therefore, conveys a general sense.
In this Ayah, there is a negation of a co-equal for Allah,
Exalted is He. And that is, because of the perfection of His
Attributes, none is equal to him; not in His knowledge, His
Hearing, His Seeing, His Power, His Might, His Wisdom
nor any of His other Attributes.
The third A yah: His statement:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

467

iT hen do not set up rivals unto Allah while you know}
(Al-Baqarah 2:22)
This comes after His statement:

4 0 mankind! Worship your Lord, Who created you and
those who were before you, so that you may have
Taqwa. Who has made the earth a resting place fo r you,
and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water from the
sky, and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for
you} (Al-Baqarah 2:21-22)
All of this is from Tawhid Ar-Rubiibiyyah. Then, He said:
i f j u J & 1 JU 4 iL jfy
}T hen do not set up rivals unto A llah} (Al-Baqarah
2 :22 )
Meaning in Al-Uluhiyyah (divinity); since those people who
were being addressed did not make rivals for Allah in
Rububiyyah (Lordship). Therefore, do not make rivals for
Allah in Al-Uluhiyyah (divinity), just as you acknowledge
that there is no rival for Him in Rububiyyah (Lordship).
❖

Concerning His statement: }A ndad (Rivals)} it is
plural of Nidd; it is the thing that is equal or
representative for it, and resembles it.

❖

Concerning His statement: }W hile you kn ow } meaning,
while you know that there is no rival for Him. It is
as if what is being said here is: Do not set up rivals
unto Allah because you indeed know that there is no
rival for Him. If you, therefore, know that, why then

468

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

do you set up rivals for Him, and by that contradict
your knowledge? This is also negating. This is taken
from His statement: 4.S0, do not set up rivals unto
Allah^ for there is no rival for Him, due to the
perfection of His Attributes.
❖ ❖ ❖

-----------

4And o f mankind are some who take, others besides
Allah as rivals. They love them as they love Alldhfy (AlBaqarah 2:165)

The fourth A yah: His statement:

4And o f mankind are some who take, others besides
Allah as rivals. They love them as they love A llah .4
(Al-Baqarah 2:165)
❖

4S°me who take others beside Allah as rivals4: they take
them as rivals; that is; in love, as He explained with
His statement: 4They love them as they love Allah4 It is
possible to say that what is intended by rivals is
more general than in love. That is, rivals they
worshiped as they worship Allah, and vow to, as
they vow to Allah, because they love them, as they
love Allah; so they love these rivals as they love
Allah, Exalted is He.

This is a form of Shirk in love, when you love other than
Allah as you love Him.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

469

This also applies to the one who loves the Messenger of
Allah
as he loves Allah, because you should love the
Messenger of Allah ^ with a love that is not like the love of
Allah. Because you only love the Messenger of Allah ^
because you love Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, not
because He is a caller of Allah. So how about one who loves
the Messenger
more than he loves Allah?
Here, it is necessary that we recognize the distinction
between love along with Allah, and loving Allah.
❖

Love along with Allah, is that you make other than
Allah the same in your love of Him, or more. This is
Shirk.

❖

Love for Allah: That is to love something out of love for
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.

What Behavioral Benefits we Derive from these Ayat:
Firstly: Concerning His statement:

4 Blessed be the Name o f your Lord, Dhtl-Jalali ivalIkrdm (the Owner o f Majesty and H onor).$ (ArRahman 55:78)
❖

If we know that Allah, Exalted is He, is described with
majesty, that will lead us to exalt and revere Him.

❖

If we know that He is described with Honor, that will
lead us to hope for His generosity and grace; that is, we
will exalt Him with what befits Him in terms of
exaltation and reverence.

Secondly: Concerning His statement:

470

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4So worship Him, and be constant and patient in His
worship4 (Maryam 19:65)
The behavioral benefit in that is that a slave will worship
His Lord and persevere patiently in His worship, not
deviating, neither tiring nor being board; he would rather
be patient in that, as someone would be patient against his
opponent in combat during Jihad.
Thirdly: His statement:

4 Do you know o f any who is similar to Him? 4
(Maryam 19:65),

4And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him^
(Al-Ikhlas 112:4),

4Then do not set up rivals unto Allah4 (Al-Baqarah
2 :22 )
In these Ayat there is the declaration that Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, is free of any imperfections, so in his heart, a
person will feel that Allah, Exalted is He, is free from every
imperfection; and that there is nothing like Him, and He
has no rival. With this, one will be able to exalt Him in the
manner He should be exalted, as far as he could.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

471

Fourthly: His statement:

iA n d o f mankind are some who take others besides
Allah as rivals.)" (Al-Baqarah 2:165)
Among its behavioral benefits is that it is not permissible
for a person to take any other as his beloved, as he loves
Allah. This is referred to as "love along with Allah."

iA n d say : "All praise is due to Allah, Who has not
begotten a son (nor any offspring), and Who has no
partner in (His) Dominion, nor He is low to have a
W aif (helper, protector or supporter). And magnify Him
with all magnificence, [Allahu-Akbar (Allah is the Most
G reat)]."i (.Al-Isrd' 17:111)

The fifth A yah:

iA n d say: "All praise is due to Allah, Who has not
begotten a son (nor any offspring), and Who has no
partner in (His) Dominion, nor He is low to have a
W aif (helper, protector or supporter). And magnify Him
with all magnificence, [Allahu-Akbar (Allah is the Most

472

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

G reat)]"} (Al-lsrd' 17:111)
❖

4And say}: the address in this kind of situation could
be specifically for the Messenger
or general for all
who could be addressed with such. If it is specific to
the Messenger
it is specific to him with the aim
that he is the direct addressee, while his Ummah is a
follower to him. If it is general, it will therefore
include the Messenger
and the others as direct
addressees.

❖

}A ll praise is due to A llah}: the interpretation of this
statement has preceded, and that "praise” is the
praiseworthy and perfect quality combined with love
and exaltation.

❖

Concerning His statement: }T o A llah}: The preposition
} to} here, can be used to express entitlement and
specialty.

It is for entitlement because Allah, Exalted is He, is praised
and He is worthy of being praised. While it is for specialty,
because the kind of praise which Allah is entitled to is
unlike the praise enjoyed by any other being; rather, it is
the most perfect, the greatest, the most general and the
most encompassing.
❖

Concerning His statement: }W h o has not begotten a son
(nor any offspring)} this is among the Attributes of
negation. }H e has not begotten a son } for the
perfection of His Attributes and the perfection of
Him not needing a thing from others, that is because
there is nothing like Him. If He had taken a son, then
the child could be like Him. If He had a child, He
would be in need of the child to help and aid Him. If
He had a child, He would be considered imperfect,
because if one of His creatures resembles Him, that is

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

473

an imperfection.
❖

His statement: 4A sonfy (Walad); includes a male or a
female. There is a refutation therein against the
Christians, the Jews and the polytheists:

The Jews say: Allah has a child! He is 'Uzayr.
The Christians said: Allah has a child! He is the Messiah.
The polytheists said: Allah has children! They are the
Angels.
❖

And His statement: 4W ho has no partner in (His)
Dominion.4 this is joined with His statement: 4He has
not begotten a son4 It He is the One Who has no
partner in His Dominion, nor in the creation, nor in
the Sovereignty, and nor in the disposition of affairs.
Everything other than Allah is a creature of Allah, a
slave of His, He disposes its affairs and controls him
as He wills; and none has a share in that with Him.
He, Exalted is He, says:

4 S a y : "Call upon those whom you assert (to be
associate gods) besides Allah, they possess not even the
weight o f an speck, either in the heavens or on the
earth."» (Saba' 34:22)
which specifies - while;

4"N or have they any share in either."4 (Saba’ 34:22)
covers any category,

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

474

4"Nor there is fo r Him any supporter from among
them "} (Saba' 34:22)
There is no one aiding Him with these heavens and earth.

4 Intercession with Him profits not, except fo r him
whom He permits} (Saba' 34:23)
With this, all the means depended upon by the polytheists,
regarding their gods, were severed. These gods have no
ability to aid in the heavens and earth, nor are they
partners to Allah, nor helpers, nor intercessors, except with
His permission.
❖

He says:

4And Who has no partner in (His) Dominion} (Al-lsra'
17:111)
❖

Concerning His statement: 4Nor He is low to have a
W ali (helper, protector or supporter).)* He does not
have a W ali (supporter, friend); but this is defined by
His statement: 4Min Adh-Dhull (as a result o f being
low )}

❖

4M in} here is for justification. Because Allah, Exalted
is He, has Awliya (friends):

4No doubt! Verily, the Awliya' o f Allah, no fear shall
come upon them nor shall they grieve. Those who
believed, and used to have Taqwa} (Yunus 10:62-63)

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

475

He, Exalted is He, said in the Qudsi Hadith: "W hoever has
enmity toward my Wall (friend), I have pronounced war
against him."^1' But the kind of Walt (supporter, friend)
being negated is one required due to lowliness; because
Allah, Exalted is He, has overall might; no kind of humility
reaches Him, due to the perfection of His might.
❖

His statement: ^And magnify Him with all the
magnificence
meaning - magnify Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, with all magnificence, with your tongue
and your soul. Believe in your heart that Allah is
greater than everything, and that His is all grandeur
in the heavens and on the earth. In the same way,
magnify Him with your tongue, saying: "Allahu
Akbar" (Allah is the Greatest).

From the guidance of the Prophet j® and his Companions
is that they would say: "Allahu Akbar" whenever they
ascended a high place[2] on journeys. The reason being that
when someone ascends a high place, he can feel that he is
superior to everybody, so he should say "Allahu Akbar" so
as diminish that highness he feels in his heart when he rises
and ascends. And when they descended, they would say:
"Subhan Allah" (Glorified is He); that is: I am exalting Him
above this lowliness which I am now.
❖

And
His
statement:
iT akbira
(with
all
the
magnificence)}: is an affirming root, intending all
splendor by it; meaning magnify Him with all the

[1]

Reported by Al-Bukhari (6502) from Abu Hurairah, may
Allah be pleased with him.
Based on the report of Al-Bukhari (2993) from Jabir, may

splendor magnificence.
The Behavioral Benefits That We Derive from these Ayah:
One will perceive the perfection of the self-Sufficiency of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, from everyone, and His
sole control of the Dominion, and the completeness of His
Might and His authority. Therefore, he will exalt Allah,
Glorified and Exalted is He, as He deserves being exalted,
as much as he could.
We also derive praising Allah, Exalted be He, declaring
that He is free of all defects, just as He is praised for the
Attributes of Perfection.

And His saying: 4 Whatsoever is in the heavens and
whatsoever is on the earth glorifies Allah. His is the
dominion, and His is the praise, and He is Able to do
all things^ (At-Taghdbun 64:1)

The sixth Ayah:

4 Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the
earth glorifies Allah. His is the dominion, and His is
the praise, and He is Able to do all things^ (AtTaghdbun 64:1)

) glorifies) meaning - declares His freedom of all
attributes of imperfection and defect. Also, (the verb)
Sabbaha could be transitive by itself and it could be
transitive with Lam.

— As for being transitive by itself, then an example is His
saying, Exalted be He:

)ln order that you may believe in Allah and His
Messenger, and that you assist and honor him, and
(that you) glorify (Allah's) praises morning and
afternoon) (Al-Fath 48:9)
— As for it being transitive with Lam, it occurs often. For
every Surah that starts with it, it is followed by a 'Lam'.
The scholars said: When the action (of glorifying) is
intended alone, it is transitive by itself. Therefore, the
meaning of )W a Tusabbihuh will be 'and you say: Subhan
A llah.’
But when the meaning is to clarify the objective and
sincerity, it is transitive with the 'Lam'; 4glorifies A llah) will
therefore mean: "Glorifying Allah sincerely, and as is
deserved." The preposition 'Lam' here shows the perfec­
tion of the will of the one glorifying, and the perfection
of the worthiness of the One Glorified - being Allah.
❖

His statement: 4 Whatsoever is in the heavens and
whatsoever is on the earth) is general, including
everything. However, the Tasbih (glorification) is of
two types: Tasbih with tongue directly and Tasbih by
implication.

As for the Tasbih by implication, it is general:

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

478

£4-4

%/s* <j* ob^5

4And there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise} (A lIsra' 17:44)
As for Tasbih with tongue directly, it is also general in a
way, but the disbeliever is not included in that, since the
disbeliever does not glorify Allah with his tongue. That is
why the Exalted says:

iG lory be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they
associate as partners with Him} (Al-Hashr 59:23)
And;

iG lorified is Allah! (He is Free) from
attribute unto H im !} (As-Saffat 37:159)

what they

Thus, they do not glorify Allah, Exalted is He, because they
associate partners with Him, and describe Him with what
does not befit Him.
The Tasbih by implication means that the condition of
everything in the heavens and on the earth indicates that
Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He, is free from defect and
deficiency. Even a disbeliever, if you contemplate his
situation, you would find that it indicates Allah, Exalted is
He, is free from defect and imperfection.
But as for the Tasbih with the tongue directly, it means to
say: "Subhdn A llah /'
❖

And concerning His statement: }H is is the dominion,
and His is the praise, and He is Able to do all things}
these last attributes are the attributes of affirmation.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

479

The mention of its meaning has preceded but
4glorifies Allah4 is an Attribute of negation, because
its meaning is exalting Him above what does not
befit Him.

iT o His slave y Muhammad 3*?; so He described him
with 'Ubiidiyyah (servitude) in the context of the
discussion about revealing the Qur'an to him. This
rank is of the most honorable ranks of the Prophet
That is why Allah, Exalted is He, describes him
with 'Ubiidiyyah (servitude) in the context of reveal­
ing the Qur'an to him, as it happens here, and as it is
it in His statement:

iA ll praise is due to Allah, Who has sent down to His
slave the Book} (A l-Kahf 18:1)
He also describes him with 'Ubiidiyyah (servitude) in the
context of defending, him and challenges (others on his
behalf):
^

have sent down to Our slave} (Al-Baqarah 2:23)

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

He also describes him with 'Ubudiyyah (servitude) in the
context of him being honored with the Mi'raj (ascension),
and says:

iG lorified be He Who took His slave fo r a journey by
night from Al-Masjid Al-Haram^ (Al-Isrd' 17:1)
He says in Surah An-Najm:

4So He revealed to His slave what He revealed$ (AnNajm 53:10)
All of this indicates that describing a person with
'Ubudiyyah (servitude) to Allah is considered a kind of
perfection, because 'Ubudiyyah (servitude) to Allah is real
freedom. Any one does not worship Him, then he is a slave
of other than Him. Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah have mercy
upon him, said:^
They fled away from the servitude fo r which they were
created for
So, they were befallen with the servitude to the self and
Shaitan
"The servitude to which they were created for” is the
worship of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
"So, they were befallen with servitude to the self and
Shaitan” since they became slaves to their souls, and slaves
to Shaifan. Nobody will flee from 'Ubudiyyah (servitude) to
Allah, except that he falls into 'Ubudiyyah (servitude) to his
whims and desires and his own Shaitan. Allah, Exalted is

And At-Taqdir (measurement) means regulation, or
eternal decree, but the first is more correct, and what
proves that is His statement, Exalted is He:

}W h o has created (even/thing), and then proportioned
it} (Al-A'ld 87:2)
W ith this, the Ayah will be considered to have an
arrangement of both a reminder and a lesson, and based
on the second (opinion), it will be seen to be arranged
based on a reminder.
The behavioral benefits we derive from these Ayat:
That it is compulsory to recognize the greatness of Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, and that we declare Him free of
any imperfection. Once we know that, we increase in
loving Him and reverence.
And from the two Ayat of Surah Al-Furqan, we understand
that this Magnificent Qur'an brings clarification, and that it
is the reference for all of the slaves; and that whenever
someone wants issues to become clear for him, he would
refer to the Qur'an, for Allah called it a criterion:

4 Blessed be He Who sent down the C riterion.} (AlFurqan 25:1)
We also benefit from behavioral instructions:
It confirms and increases our love for the Messenger of
Allah
since he was Allah's slave, executing the
responsibility of conveying the message, and warning the
creation.
We also derive from it that the Prophet

be Allah above all that they attribute to Him! Knower o f
the unseen and the witnessed! Exalted be He over all
that they associate with H im !} (Al-Mu'minun 23:91-92)
In this Ayah, Allah, Most High, negates having taken a son,
or that there is any god with Him. This negation is further
emphasized with the use of the preposition }M in } in His
statement: }M in Walad (any son )} and His statement:
}M in Ilah (any g od )} because the addition of any
preposition in the context of a negation or its like, implies
emphasis.
❖

So, His statement: }N o son (or offspring or children) did
Allah beget} means - He did not select anybody to be
His son, not 'Uzayr, neither the Messiah, nor the
Angels, nor other than them; because He is free of
any need from other than Him. So when Him having
a child is negated, then negating that He is a father is
more obvious.

❖

Concerning His statement: }M in Ilah (any god)}: }Ildh
(god)} means Ma'luh (deified) just like Band' carries the
meaning of M abnni (constructed) and Firash carries the
meaning of Mafrush (bedded, or spread out); so Al-Ilah
means Al-Ma'luh (the deified) that is: - that which is
worshipped, which one is subservient to.

Meaning: There is no god, in truth, along with Him. As for
the false gods, they exist; but since they are false, it is as if
they do not exist. So it is correct to say there is no god along
with Allah.
❖

}Id h a n } meaning — if there was any god along with
Him.

❖

}E ach god would have taken away what he had created,
and some would have tried to overcome others} If there
had been any other god equal to Allah, the Mighty

486

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

and Sublime, he would have a dominion that is
specific to him, while Allah would have a dominion
that is specific to Him; meaning - each would have
been with what he had created saying this is my
creation, it belongs to me; and like that, the other.
Hence, each of them would want to take control over the
other, as ordinarily occurs. The kings of the world, each of
them wants to take control of the other so that all dominion
becomes his.
Therefore, they would either prevent one another, such that
each one would be incapable of overcoming the other; and
when each of them is incapable of overcoming the other; it
is not correct that one of them be a god; because Al-Ildh (the
God) is not incapable.
Otherwise, one of them would overcome the other, and as
such, the dominant one is Al-Ilah (the God).
Thus, the issue returns to the fact that there must be one
God for the universe, and it is not possible that there ever
be two gods, because the final outcome can not be other
than one of these two cases.
Just as when we observe the universe in its entirety, we
discover that it is a universe being directed by one;
otherwise, there could have been contradictions in it. One
of the two gods could have said for example: "I want the
sun to rise from the W est" while the second could have
said: "I want it rising from the East". The possibility that
they will have agreed one what they wanted is very
remote, particularly since the situation is that of being in
authority; each would want that his view be decreed.
What is known is that now, we do not observe the sun
rising in a day here and another day there. Or being
delayed one day because the second god prevented it, or

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

487

makes it rise earlier on this day, because the first god orders
the second god to make it rise; we do not find this. We find
the entire universe, as one, being harm onious and
coordinated; which clearly proves that the sole controller
is one, and that is Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, explains by intellectual
evidence, that a plurality of gods is not possible, since if a
plurality of gods was possible, then this would be the
result. Each of them would have separated from the other,
and each would go to what he created. Therefore, either
one of them would be incapable before the other, or one
them would overcome the other. If in the first case; divinity
(.Al-Uluhiyyah) would not be suitable for either of them, in
the second case, the dominant one would be the god,
therefore, there will be only one god.
If it is said: Is it not possible that they could both come to
an agreement, and each of them stay alone with what he
created? The answer is that if it was possible and it
happened, then it would disrupt the organization of the
universe.
Then, their agreement would only be out of mutual fear for
each other. Hence, Rububiyyah (Lordship) would not be
suitable for either of them due to his inability to subdue the
other.
❖

Then, He, Exalted is He, says: ^Glorified be Allah above
all that they attribute to Him!'} That is declaring Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, free from what the disbe­
lieving polytheists describe Him with, those who say
about Allah, Glorified be He, that which does not
befit Him.

❖

4 Knower o f the unseen and the witnessed!): The

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

488

while the 4 witnessed 4 is what is seen by the people.
❖

4 Exalted be He over all that they associate as partners to
Him!
4 Exalted be He$ meaning - He is raised above
it, Hallowed, and Exalted.

❖

$Over all that they associate with Himiy, above the
idols which are taken as gods along with Allah,
Exalted is He.

The Attributes of negation contained in these two Ayat are:
that Allah is free from taking the child that the unbelievers
describe Him with, and from the partner in Uluhiyyah
(divinity) which the polytheists associate with Him.
This negation is because of the perfection of His selfsufficiency, and perfection of His Rububiyyah (Lordship)
and His Uluhiyyah (Divinity).
The Behavioral Benefits We Derive from these Ayat:
That faith in this leads the person to being sincere to Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime.

4 So put not forward similitudes fo r Allah. Truly! Allah

— ❖ ❖ ❖ .......................................

The Eleventh Ayah:

4So put not forw ard similitudes fo r Allah. Truly! Allah
knows and you know not4 (An-Nahl 16:74)

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

489

Meaning, do not coin a similitude for Allah saying: The
example of Allah is like the example of so-and-so; or
associate to Him a partner in worship.
❖

iT ru ly! Allah knows and you know notfy: Meaning that
He, Glorified and Exalted be He, knows that there is
no similitude for Him; He has informed you that He
does not have a like in His statement:

$There is nothing like unto Himfy (Ash-Shura 42:42)
And His statement:

4And there is none co-equal unto H im .4 (Al-Ikhlas
112:4)
And His statement:
/I
4Do you know o f any who is similar to Him?4
(Maryam 19:65)
And the like. So, Allah knows and you know not.
It can be said that this clause consists of a clear proof that
Allah does not have a similitude, and that it is like drawing
a similitude to negate a similitude, because we do not
know and Allah knows. If knowledge is negated from us,
and affirmed for Allah, where is the similarity? Can an
ignorant one be similar to a knowledgeable one?
A proof of the incompleteness of our knowledge, is that
man does not know what he will do tomorrow:

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

490

4 No person knows what he will earn
(Luqman 31:34)

tomorrow

And that man does not know the soul within his body:

4And they ask you concerning the R uh; S ay: "The

Philosophy, philosophers, and other than them, continue
researching the reality of this soul; they will never discover
its reality, in spite of the fact that it is an element of life.
This shows the inadequacy of the knowledge of the
creatures, and as such Allah, the Most High, says:

And His statement, Exalted is He:

(Al-Baqarah 2:22)
The answer is, that He was addressing those who associate
partners with Him in Al-Uluhiyyah (divinity); so he says:
4Then do not set up rivals unto Alldh4 in worship and
divinity, while; 4 You know4 that there is no rival for Him

in Ar-Rububiyyah (the Lordship) based on the proof in
His statement:

4 0 mankind! Worship your Lord, Who created you and
those who were before you so that you may have Taqwa.

sky as a canopy, and sent down water from the sky,
and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for
you. Then do not set up rivals unto Allah while you
kn ow } (Al-Baqarah 2:21-22)
But here, it is in the matter regarding the Attributes:

}S o put not forw ard similitudes fo r Allah} (An-Nahl
16:74)
So, you say for example: "A llah's Hand is like so-and-so's
hand; Allah's Face is like the face of so-and-so; Allah's Self
is like the self of so-and-so” and the like; because Allah,
Exalted is He, knows, while you know not, and He has
informed you that He does not have any similitude.
Or, it is said that the affirmation of knowledge for them is
specifically in the matters concerning Rububiyyah (Lord­
ship), and negating knowledge from them is specifically in
the matters of ATUluhiyyah (divinity); since they associate
partners with Allah regarding that; they, therefore,
descended to the level of the ignorant.
From the kind of perfection included in this Ayah is the

what is done openly o f it or secretly, and sins, and oppression
without right, and that you associate with Allah that for
which He has not revealed any authority, and that you say
about Allah what you do not know. "4 (Al-A'raf 7:33)
❖

4Say$\ the address is directed to the Prophet
meaning — say openly to the people.

❖

^Onlyfy (Innamd): an article of restriction, and that is
to oppose those who make unlawful what Allah has
made lawful.

❖

4 unlawful4 (Harrama): meaning — prevented. And
the root of this form (H a , Ra , Mini) indicates to
withhold, and from it is " H arim ul-BiY '^ for the
earth, which garrisons around it, because it prevents
it from going beyond it.

❖

4Al-Rawahishy. It is a plural of Fdhishah which refers
to the sins deemed to be obscene, such as Zina and
homosexual acts.

As for Zina, Allah said concerning it:

4And come not near to the Zina (unlawful sexual
intercourse). Verily, it is a F d h ish a h (A l-Isra ’ 17:32)
As for homosexual acts, Lut said to his people:

4Do you commit the Fdhishah?]} (Al-A'raf 7:80)
Included in Zina is when a man marries a woman that is
not lawful for him due to factors of kinship, fosterage or

marital relationship. Allah, Exalted is He, says:

iA n d marry not women whom your fathers married,
except what has already p assed ; indeed it was a
Fahishah, and most hateful, and an evil w ay } (An-Nisd'
4:22)
Rather, this is even worse than Zina, for He gives three
offensive attributes: Fahishah, hatefulness and an evil way,
whereas concerning Zina, Allah gives it two attributes:

iV erily , it is a Fahishah, and an evil way} (Al-Isra'
17:32)
❖

Concerning His statement: } what is done openly o f it or
s e c r e t l y It is said that the meaning is whose
obscenity is glaring or hidden. It is also said the
meaning is: what is open to people and what is
hidden to them, given consideration to the action of
the doer, not the action. That is, what somebody does
openly before the people, and what he hides from
them.

❖

Concerning His statement: }an d sins, and oppression
without right} meaning - sin and oppression without
right is unlawful.

Al-Ilhm (sin) refers to whatever has a basis in the acts of
disobedience.
Al-Baght (oppression): Transgression against people. Allah,
Exalted is He, says:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

495

4 The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress
men and wrongly rebel (yabghuna) in the earth4 (AshShura 42:42)
❖

And concerning His statement: ia n d sins, and
oppression without right4 is an indication of the fact
that every form of oppression is without right. It
does not mean that oppression is divided into two
types: rightful oppression and oppression without
right; since all forms of oppression are without right.
Hence, the description used here is a type of
explanatory description, the scholars refer to it as
Sifatun Kashifatun, that is; clarifying. It is as if it is the
explanation about what is being described.

❖

And concerning His statement: 4And associate with
Allah that fo r which He has not revealed any authority4
This is connected with what preceded; meaning - my
Lord prohibits you from associating with Allah that
which He has revealed no authority; meaning: that
you make a partner for Him for which He has not
revealed any authority, meaning (any) Hujjah (proof).
The Hujjah is referred to as authority because it is the
authority for the one who proves with it.

And this restriction: 4 bor which He has not revealed any
authority4: What we say concerning it is like what we
said regarding 4°pPressi°n without rights That is, it is an
explanatory restriction; since all who join partners with
Allah do not have any authority to join partners with
Him.
❖

Concerning His statement: ia n d that you say about
Allah what you do not kn ow i — and He made it
unlawful that you say about Allah what you do not
know; so it is unlawful for us to say about Allah
what we do not know, whether concerning His Self,

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

496

His Names, His Attributes, His Actions, or His
Rulings. Allah prohibits us from these five things.
In it is a refutation against the polytheists; those who made
unlawful what Allah did not make unlawful.
If somebody asks: Where is the attribute of negation in this
Ayah?

We say that it is: ia n d that you associate with Allah that for
which He has not revealed any authority, and that you say
about Allah what you do not kn ow i Both are from the
Attributes of negation: 4And that you associate4 meaning do not make a partner for Allah, due to His perfection.
iA n d that you say about Allah what you do not know4 is
also like that, because of His perfection; for it is out of
His complete authority that no one may say about Him
what he does not know.
The behavioral benefit derived from this Ayah is that we
would avoid these five things that Allah, Exalted is He,
clearly stated are unlawful. The people of knowledge have
said that these five unlawful things are among those acts
which all of the revealed Sharfahs agreed upon being
unlawful.
Included in speaking about Allah without knowledge is
Tahrif (distorting) with the texts of the Book and the Sunnah
about the Attributes and other than that; for if someone
distorts the texts in the case of the Attributes; such as
saying: "The intended meaning by the two Hands is
bounty” he has said about Allah what he does not know,
from two perspectives:
The First perspective: He negated the apparentness of it,
without knowledge.
The Second perspective: He affirmed for Allah what
opposes it without evidence.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

497

He says: "Allah did not intend that, rather He intended
such-and-such." We say (to him): "Bring the evidence that
He did not intend such-and-such, and that He intended
such-and-such; and since you cannot provide the evidence,
you have thus spoken about Allah with what you do not
know."

Rising of Allah over His Throne

The Commentary
The author,
mentioned the affirmation of Allah's rising
over His Throne, and that it is in seven places in the
Qur'an:
The First Place: His statement in Surat Al-A'raf.

4 Indeed your Lord is Allah, Wlto created the heavens
and the earth in six days, and then He Istawa (rose
over) the Throne^ (Al-A'raf 7:54)

498

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

❖

fW h o created the heavens and the earthy. He originated
them from nothingness in a perfect and precise
manner.

❖

fi n six days4'. The length of these days are like our
days which we know, because Allah, Glorified and
Exalted be He, mentioned them as an indefinite noun,
so, it will be understood to mean what is known.

The first of these days is Yawm Al-Ahad (Sunday) and the
last is the day of Jumu'ah (Friday).
Four of these days were for the earth, and two of them
were for the heavens, as Allah explains in Surah Fussilat:

f S a y : "Do you verily disbelieve in Him Who created
the earth in two days and you set up rivals with Him?
That is the Lord o f the 'Alamin. He placed therein firm
mountains from above it, and He blessed it, and
measured therein its sustenance in fou r days equal, for
all those who a sk ."4 (Fussilat 41:9-10)
So it totaled four days.

fT hen He Istawa (rose over) toward the heaven when it
was smoke, and said to it, and to the earth : "Come both
o f you, ivillingly or unwillingly." They both said: "We
come, willingly." Then He completed and finished them
(as) seven heavens, in two days* (Fussilat 41:11-12)

And concerning His statement: }A n d then He Istawa
(rose over) the Throne} ; 4 then} ('Thumma) for sequence.

❖

ilstaw a meaning elevated above.

❖

iT h e Throne} is that roof that surrounds the
creatures; we do not know the material of this
Throne (which it is made from); for no authentic
Hadith is related from the Prophet
explaining what
this Throne was created from. However, we know
that it is the biggest of all the creatures that we know
of.

The root of the word 'Arsh (throne) in the Arabic Language
is the bed which the king specially chooses for himself; and
it is known that the bed which the king specially chooses
for himself will be marvelous and majestic, without an
equal.
There are a number of Attributes of Allah, Exalted is He, in
this Ayah but the author mentioned it to affirm just one
Attribute, and that is; rising over the Throne.
❖

The People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah believe that
Allah, Exalted is He, rises over His Throne, with a
rising that befits His Majesty, and it is not like the rising
of creatures.

If you ask: "W hat does Istawa mean to them ?"[1] Its
meaning is transcendence and settling.
Four meanings for its interpretation have been related from
the Salaf (pious predecessors):
The First: Elevated. The Second: Raised. Thirdly: Ascended.
Fourthly: Settled. But 'elevated/ 'raised/ and 'ascended'
have the same meaning; as for 'settled', it has a different
(Translation note) meaning, to the people of the Sunnah.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

500

meaning.
Their evidence for that is that in all its etymological
discussions in the Arabic lexicons, it has not come except
with this meaning when its in the transitive form with the
preposition 'Ala (upon or over); Allah, the Most High, says:

iA n d when you have embarked (istawaita) on ('ala) the
ship, you and whoever is with y o u i (.Al-Mu'minun
23:28)
And He, the Most High, also said:

iA n d has appointed fo r you ships and cattle on which
you ride. In order that you may mount firm ly (tastawu)
on ('ala) their backs, and then may remember the Favor
o f your Lord when you mount (istawaitum) thereon
('alaihi)i (Az-Zukhruf 43:12-13)
❖

The people of Ta'til (denial) interpreted it to mean
'conquered'. They said the meaning of:

iT hen He Istawa (rose over) the Throne)» (Al-A'rdf
7:54)
Is "Then, He took control of it."
They presented both affirming and negating proofs to
establish this Ta'til of theirs.
As for the affirming proof, they said: We will prove with
the saying of the poet:
Bishr has conquered (Istawa) Al-'Iraq

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

501

Without a sword, nor with flow ing blood
"Bishr:" is Ibn Marwan; Istawa; means he took control of
Al-'Iraq. They said that this line of the poem was composed
by an 'Arab man, and it is not possible that what is
intended by it, is that he Istawa over Al-'Iraq, meaning that
he rose over Al-'Iraq; especially since at that time, there
were no airplanes with which he could have flown over Al'Iraq.
As for the negating proof, they said: "If we affirm that
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, rises over His Throne in the
manner in which you claim, which is transcendence and
settlement, that will necessitate that He is in need of the
Throne; and this is impossible. Therefore, the impossibility
of what is implied shows the impossibility of what implies
it.
It also implies that He is physical (has a body); because the
Istawa’ of something upon another thing, with the meaning
that it rose above it, means that it is physical.
It also implies that He is limited, because he who rises over
something is limited. If you ascended upon a camel, then
you are restricted to a particular space, confined in it, it
being limited as well.''
These are the three things which they claim are implied by
the affirmation that Istawa' means exalted and raised.
❖

The Refutation against them is from various perspec­
tives:

Firstly: This interpretation of yours opposes the interpreta­
tion of the Salaf (pious predecessors) which they agreed
upon. The proof of their consensus is that it has not been
reported that they said this and opposed what is apparent.
If they saw that it was contrary to what was apparent, then
that would have been transmitted to us. None of them ever

502

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

said the meaning of Istawa' is 'Istaivla' (conquered).
Secondly: That it is contrary to what is apparent in the
expression, because when the term Istawa' is made
transitive with the use of the preposition 'Ala (over), it
conveys the meaning of transcendence and settled. This is
what is obvious in the expression. This is its common usage
in the Qur'an and the Arabic Language.
Thirdly: That it implies false implications:
1.

It implies that when Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
was creating the heavens and the earth, He had not
taken control of His Throne, because Allah says:

$He created the heavens and the earth in six days, and
then He Istawa (rose over) the T h ro n e(A l-A 'ra f 7:54)
And iT h en ^ (Thumma) restricts the sequence. So, it will
imply that the Throne had been under the control of
other than Allah before the creation of the heavens and
the earth was completed.
2.

The predominant use of the word Istawla is only after a
conquest; whereas, there is none who can overcome
Allah.
Where is the escape route while the God is the Seeker
The one with the disfigured nose is the overcome, not the one
overcoming.[1]

3.

Among the false implications is that it would be correct
for us to say that Allah Istawa' over the earth, the trees
and the mountains, because He indeed controls them.
This poem is attributed to Nufail bin Habib; he said it
when Allah sent down the punishment upon owners of the
Elephant. Tafsir Ibn Kathir (4:502).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

503

These implications are false, and the falsehood of an
implication proves the falsehood of what implies it.
As for their using the line of poetry as proof, we say:
1.

2.

3.

Affirm for us the chain of transmission for this poem,
and the trustworthiness of its narrators; they will never
find a way to that.[11
Who is this poet? Is it not possible that he composed
the poem after the A rabic Language had been
distorted; because every saying that is used in Arabic
language as a proof after the distortion of the Arabic
language is not a proof. The Arabic Language began to
be distorted after conquests spread, and the non-Arabs
began to mix with the Arabs, which therefore led to the
alteration in their Language. Therefore, in this is an
implication that it was after the distortion of the
Language.
Your interpretation of; "Bishr Istawa over Al-Traq," to
mean Istawla (conquered) is an interpretation that is
supported by its context; since it is impossible that
Bishr ascended above Al-Traq, to rise over it as he
mounts upon his bed or an animal's back. That is why
we resort to Istawla in its (the poem's) interpretation.

We are saying this just as a way of condescending,

Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said: "And no authentic
transmission is affirmed that it is an Arabic poem, and
many of the Imams of (Arabic) grammar reject it, and say
that it is a fabricated poem not known in the language, and
it is known that if one advances proof with the Hadith of
the Messenger of Allah s||, he would need to prove that to
be authentic; how about a poem whose chain of
transmission is unknown? And the Imams of language
have criticized it." "Majmu Al-Fatdwd" (5/146).

504

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

otherwise, we have another answer for this. And that is to
say that the Istawa that is contained in the line (verse) of the
poem means transcendence because transcendence has two
types:
1.
2.

Sensory transcendence, such as our ascending upon the
bed.
And transcendence in meaning, which means authority
and conquering.

Therefore, the meaning of "Bishr Istawa Al-'Iraq" will be
that he ascended, exalting by conquest and force.
But as for your saying that interpreting Istawa to mean
transcendence implies that Allah is a physical entity; its
reply is that whatever is implied in the Book of Allah and
the Sunnah of His Messenger
is the truth, and it is
compulsory upon us to stick to it. But what is important is
if this is the implication of the statement of Allah and His
Messenger, because there can be what prevents it from
being implied; so, when it is affirmed that it is the
implication, then it should be so, and there is no harm
upon us if we say that.
Then, we ask: What do you mean by the body that is being
denied? If by it, you mean that Allah has no Self, described
with attributes that are inseparable and befitting it, then
your statement is false, because Allah has a real Self,
described with attributes, and He has a Face, a Hand, an
Eye, a Foot. So say whatever you wish to say regarding the
implications which are the implications of the truth.
If, by the body which is denied from Allah, you intend the
body which is composed of bones, flesh, blood and the like,
this is denied from Allah, and saying that Allah's Istawa
over the Throne means His transcendence over it does not
necessitate that.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

505

As for their statement that it implies that He is limited; its
reply is to specifically ask: What do you mean by limited? If
by Him being limited, you mean that He is completely
separate from His creation, as Zaid will have a parcel of
land while 'Amr also has a parcel of land, when one is
completely separated from the other, this is the truth, there
is no imperfection therein.
But if by him being limited you mean that He is
surrounded by the Throne; then is false, and not implied,
because Allah, Exalted is He, rises over the Throne, and He,
Mighty and Sublime, is greater than the Throne, and
greater than other than it, and that does not imply that the
Throne surrounds Him. Rather, it is not possible that it
surrounds Him because Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He,
is greater and bigger than everything. All the earth will be
grabbed by His Hand on the Day of Resurrection, while the
heavens are rolled up with His Right Hand.
As for their statement that it implies that He is in need of
the Throne; we reply that this is not implied, because the
meaning of His rising above the Throne is that He is above
the Throne; but it is transcendence specific to Him; its
meaning is not that the Throne ever supports Him; for
indeed the Throne does not support Him, and the heavens
do not support Him. This implication which you are
claiming is not possible, because it is an imperfection with
respect to Allah, Mighty and Sublime, and it is not of the
implications of the reality of the Istawa', because we are not
saying that the meaning of 4Then, He Istawa' over the
Throne} is that the Throne will support Him or carry
Him; the Throne is carried:

$ A n d eig h t A n gels w ill, that D ay, bear the T hron e o f

506

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

your Lord above them } (Al-Haqqah 69:17)
The Angels carry it now, but it does not carry Allah,
Mighty and Sublime, because Allah, Glorified and Exalted
be He, is not in need of it, nor does He require it. With this,
their negating proofs are shown to be false.
The summary of our refutation of their saying is from a
number of viewpoints:
Firstly: That this saying of theirs opposes the apparentness
of the text.
Secondly: It opposes the consensus of the Companions,
and the consensus of the S alaf (pious predecessors)
altogether.
Thirdly: That it is not related in the Arabic Language that
the word Istawa means Istawla (conquered) and this line of
poetry used to prove that is not completely usable as a
proof.
Fourthly: That it necessitates false implications:
— Among them, that before the creation of the heavens and
the earth, the Throne was under the control of other than
Allah.
— That the word Istawla (conquered) as usually used,
suggests that there was a struggle for control between
Allah and other than Him, and then later He gained control
over him and overcame him.
— That it is correct that we say - based on your claim - that
Allah Istawa over the land, the trees, the mountains, the
man, and the camel, because He controls these things. If it
is correct to use the word Istawla for something, it is also
correct to use the word Istawa for such thing, because they
are synonymous, according to their claim. With these
points, it becomes clear that their interpretation is false.

507

Commentary On The Introductory Notes.

❖

When Abu Al-Ma'ali Al-Juwairu, may Allah pardon
him, was establishing the methodology of the Ash'ariyyah, and rejecting Allah's Istawa' over the Throne;
rather, he was rejecting Allah's 'Ulii in His Self, he said:
"Allah, Exalted is He, was, and there was nothing other
than him; He is now over what He was over.'' He
wanted to deny Allah's Istawa' over the Throne.
Meaning: 'He was, and there was no Throne, and He
is now over what He was over.' Therefore, He never
ascended over the Throne.

Then, Abu Al-'Ala' Al-Hamdhani said to him: "O teacher, let
us leave the mention of the Throne and the rising over the
Throne" - he means, because its proof is of the revealed texts.
If Allah had not informed us of it, we could not have known
of it. — "Inform us about this necessity which we find in our
selves. No sane person will ever say: 'O Allah' except that he
finds in his self the necessity to seek the Exalted."
So, Abu Al-Ma'ali became perplexed and began to hit his
head saying: "Al-Hamdhani confounded me, Al-Hamdhanl confounded m e!" That was because this is an instinctual
proof which nobody can reject.

}'A la Al-'Arsh (over the Throne)} is stated first despite
it being what the ilstaw a (rose)} is done to, in order

Allah, Glorified and Exalted be He, does not rise

And in His mention }A r-R ahm an } is an indication of
the fact that He is described with mercy in addition

He, mentions Istawa (rising) that is transitive by the
preposition 'Ala (above, over).
❖

Furthermore, the scholars have said: The root of this
form (Sin, Waw Yd') indicates perfection; (Allah,
Exalted be He, says):

$W ho has created (everything), and then proportioned it
(Fasawwa)4 (Al-A'la 87:2)
Meaning that He has completed and perfected His creation.
Thus, the origin of the Sin, Waw and Yd' indicates
perfection.
❖

Then it (the word Istawa) is (used) in the Arabic
Language in four ways:

With the preposition Ila (to, towards), with the preposition
'Ala (above, over), together with the conjunction of Waw
(and), and alone.
As for an example of when it is used with the preposition
'Ala (above, over):

ilstaw a 'ala (rose over) the T h r o n e (Al-Hadid 57:4)
As for an example when it is used with the preposition lid
(to), it is His, Exalted be He, statement:

4 Then He Istawa ila (towards) the heaven and made
them seven heavens4 (Al-Baqarah 2:29)
Is its meaning like the first one, which is used with the
preposition 'Ala?

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

513

There is a difference of opinion concerning it among the
scholars of Tafsir.There are among them those who said
that their meanings are the same. This is the apparent
interpretation of Ibn Jarir,^ so the meaning of 4He Istawa
towards the heaven^ is that He rose over to it.
Among them are those who said: Rather Al-Istawd' here
means complete objective. Thus, the meaning of Istawa
ilaihd is that He focused upon it com pletely. They
substantiate their interpretation with the fact that the
preposition, Ila, used with it (the verb Istawa) indicates this
meaning. Ibn Kathir, may Allah have Mercy upon him,
held this position, and explained His statement:

iT hen
2:29)

He Istawa towards the heaven$ (Al-Baqarah

To mean the He focused upon the heavens. The meaning of
Al-Istiwd' here conveys the meaning of the objective, and
turning towards, because it is used with the preposition Ila.
As for the one used together with the conjunction of Waw,
its example is such as people's saying: "Istawa Al-Ma'u walKhabshatu (the water and the wood)”; to mean that the
water leveled up to the wood.
As for when it is used alone, as in His statement, Exalted is He:

<$And when he attained his fu ll strength and Istawa$
(.Al-Qasas 2 8 :14)
Its meaning (here) is "becam e complete”

(Translation note): Meaning At-Taban, in his Tafsir.

514

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

An Important Point:
When we say: "H e Istawa above the Throne," meaning - He
is high above it, then here is a question: "Allah created the
heavens and then rose over the Throne, does that suggest
that He had not been exalted before that?"
The answer is that it does not suggest that, because rising
above the Throne is specific among the absolute transcen­
dence, since rising above the Throne is a transcendence that
is specific for it (the Throne), while the transcendence is
above all creatures. His, Mighty and Sublime, transcen­
dence is affirmed for Him without end, forever. He was
High above all things before He created the Throne. And
Him not rising above the Throne does not imply that He
was not High. Nay, He is High. Then, after the creation of
the heavens and the earth, He rose above the Throne in a
manner that is specific to the Throne.
If you say: We understand from the noble Ayah that when
He was creating the heavens and the earth, He was not
ascendant above the Throne; but before the creation of the
heavens and the earth, was He ascendant above the Throne
or not?
The answer is Allah knows best regarding that.
If you ask: Is Allah's rising above the Throne an Attribute
of action, or a Self Attribute?
The answer is that it is among the Attributes of action,
because it is dependant upon his will, and every Attribute
that is dependant upon His, is an Attribute of action.

4 0 'Isa! I will take you and raise you to M yself} (Al
'Imran 3:55)

#

Affirm ation of A llah's 'Ulu (Transcendence) Above
His Creatures

The Commentary
The author,
mentioned six Ayat concerning Allah's 'Ulu
above His creation.
The first A yah: His statement:

i O 'Isa! I will take you and raise you to M yself} (Al
'Imran 3:55)
❖

The address was directed to 'Isa bin Maryam, whom
Allah created from a mother without a father; that is
why he was named after his mother. Therefore, it is
said: "Isa the son of M aryam.''

❖

Allah says: } I will take y ou } (Inni mutawaffika) The
scholars mentioned three sayings about it:

The First saying: } I will take y ou } (Inni mutawaffika);
meaning "I will collect you.” And from it, is their saying:
"H e Tawaffa his right," meaning collected it.
The Second saying: }take y o u } (mutawaffika) meaning I
will cause you to sleep; because sleep is a form of death,
as He, Exalted is He, says:

516

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

i l t is He, Who takes your souls by night (when you are
asleep), and has knowledge o f all that you have done by
day, then he raises (wakes) you up again, that a term
appointed (your life period) be fulfilled^ (Al-An'dm 6:60)
The Third saying: That it is the seizure of death. 41 will
take you4 (Inni mutawaffika) meaning - I will cause you to
die. Of such meaning is His statement:

411 is Allah Who takes away (yatawaffd) the souls at the
time o f their death^ (Az-Zumar 39:42)
The view that 4will take you4 (mutawaffika) means "I will
cause you to die” is further (from what is correct);
because Tsa has not died; he will descend at the end of
time. Allah, Exalted is He, says:

4And there is none o f the people o f the Scripture (jews
and Christians), but must believe in him , before his
deaths (An-Nisa' 4:159)
That is before the death of Tsa according to one of the two
opinions (regarding its interpretation). That will be when
he descends at the end of time. It is also said (it means)
before the death of any one of them; meaning - there is
none among the people of Scripture except, that at time of
his death, he is to believe Tsa; even if such a person is a
Jew. This saying is weak.
So what remains, is considering the difference between the
taking that means collecting, and the taking that means
sleeping. And we say that it is possible to harmonize

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

517

between them. Thus, He will seize him while he is sleeping.
Meaning that is Allah will make him sleep, and then raise
him. Moreover, there is no contradiction between these
two.
❖

Concerning His statement: 4And raise you to M yselff:
Which is the point of reference here. For 4T° M yselfo
(Ilayya) implies Al-Ghayah (the utmost). And His
statement: 4 And raise you to M yselfo shows that the
one to whom he is being raised is high. So, this
establishes the transcendence of Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime.

If somebody says that what is intended is "I will raise your
status” as Allah, Exalted is He, says:

4Held in honor in this world and in the Hereafter, and
will be one o f those who are near to Allah4 (Al 'Imran
3:45)
We say in reply: This is not right; because the "raise” here
is used with a preposition which is specifically known to be
used to mean above; to express the raising of the body, and
not the raising of status.
❖

Know that the 'Ulu of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime,
is divided into two categories: 'Ulu in meaning, and
'Ulu of the Self.

1.

As for 'Ulu in meaning, it is affirmed for Allah
according to the consensus of all of the people of the
Qiblah (the M uslim s). That is, according to the
consensus of the people of Innovation and the People
of the Sunnah. All of them believe that Allah, Exalted is
He, is Exalted in meaning.
As for 'Ulu in the Self, the People of the Sunnah affirm

2.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

518

it; but the people of Innovation do not affirm it. They
say: "Allah is not, Himself, High."
So first, we start by mentioning the proofs of the People of
the Sunnah for Allah's 'Ulu, Glorified and Exalted be He, in
His Self. Thus, we say:
As evidence, the People of the Sunnah use the Book, the
Sunnah, consensus, the intellect, and the Fitrah to prove the
'Ulu of Allah, Exalted be He, in His Self.
Firstly: The proofs contained in the Book concerning
Allah's 'Ulu are of various categories. Sometimes, by
mention the 'Ulu. And sometimes, it comes with the
mention of Him being above; sometimes with the mention
of things descending from Him; sometimes with the
mention of things ascending to Him, and sometimes with
the fact that He is above the heavens.
1. As for 'Ulu, an example is His statement:

}A n d He is the Most High, the Most G reat} (AlBaqarah 2:255)
(And)

} Glorify the Name o f your Lord, the Most High} (AlA'la 87:1)
2. As for being above:

}A n d He is the Irresistible, above His slaves} (AlAn'am 6:18)
(And)

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

iT h ey fear their Lord above them, and they do what
they are com m anded) (An-Nahl 16:50)
3.

As for the descent of things from Him, an example is
His statement:

4 He arranges (every) affair from the heavens to the
earth) (As-Sajdah 32:5)
(And)

4 Verily W e: It is We Who have sent down the Dhikr
(the Qur'an) ) (Al-Hijr 15:9)
And the like.
4.

Regarding the ascension of things to Him, an example
is His statement:

4To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the
righteous deeds) (Fatir 35:10)
And His statement:

4The Angels and the Ruh ascend to H im ) (Al-Ma'arij
70:4)
5.

As for Him being above the heavens, an example is His
statement:

520

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4Do you feel secure that He, Who is above the heavens
(Allah), will not cause the earth to sink with you?4 (AlMulk 67:16)
Secondly: As for the Sunnah, it has been narrated from the
Prophet ^ in his statements, his actions and his tacit
approvals, in Mutawdtir narrations.
1. As for the sayings of the Messenger
they include the
mentioning of 'Ulu and Fawqiyyah (being above).
Among these, his % statement: "Glorified be my
Lord, the Most High.” 111 And his statement, when
mentioning the heavens, he said: "And Allah is above
the Throne.” t21
And the mentioned that Allah is above the heavens, as in
his
saying: "W ill you not trust me, while I am the trusted
one of He Who is above the heavens.” ^31
2.

As for actions, an example is his raising his finger
toward the heavens while giving a sermon in the
largest of all gatherings - on the day of 'Arafah, in the
year of the Farewell Pilgrimage; for the Companions

[11

Reported by Muslim (772) from the Hadith of Hudhaifah,
may Allah be pleased with him.
Reported by Ibn Khuzaimah in Kitdb At-Tawhid (1:244), AlLalaka'l in Sharh As-Sunnah (659), and At-Tabaran! in AlKabir (9:228). In Al-Majma' (1:86), Al-Haytham! said: "It
was reported by At-Tabaranl, and its narrators are
narrators of the Sahih.''lt was also reported by AlBayhaql in Al-Asma' was-Sifdt (851), Abu Ash-Shaikh in
Al-'Azamah (279), Ad-DarimI in Ar-Radd 'Alal-Jahmiyyah
(81), and in Al-'Ulu, Adh-DhahabI said: "Its chain is
authentic." (Mukhtasar Al-'Ulu 48) from the Hadith of Ibn
Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him.
Reported by Al-Bukhari (4351) and Muslim (1064) from
Abu Sa'Id Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him.

had never congregated in a single gathering greater
than that, such that the num ber of those who
performed Hajj with him were about 100,000, and
those who had died among them were about 124,000,
meaning that the Muslims in general, attended the
gathering. He
said: "Listen attentively, have I
conveyed the message?” They said: "Yes.” "Listen
attentively, have I conveyed the message?” They said:
"Y e s.” "L isten attentively, have I conveyed the
message?” They said: "Y es." And he was saying: "O
Allah, be a witness," pointing to the heaven with his
finger, and pointing with it, at the people.[1]
Included in this is his raising his hands toward the heavens
during supplication. This is an affirmation of 'Ulu by
action.
3.

As for tacit approval, in the Hadith of Mu'awiyah bin
Al-Hakam, may Allah be pleased with him, he came
with a slave girl, whom he wanted to free. Thus, the
Prophet 5|| asked her: "W here is Allah?” She answered:
"Above the heavens." The he asked: "W ho am I?” She
replied: "The Messenger of Allah.” He said: "Free her,
for indeed she is a believer.” 121

This slave girl was not learned, what is common is that
young girls were ignorant; particularly when she was a
slave and not a free girl. She was not in charge of herself.
Yet, she knew that her Lord was above the heavens, while
the lost ones among the children of Adam deny that Allah
is above the heavens, saying that He is not above the
universe, nor below it; nor to the right, nor to the left, or,
[11

[21

Reported by Muslim (1218) from the lengthy Hadith of
Jabir bin 'Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him,
regarding the Hajj of the Prophet
It has preceded, and it was reported by Muslim.

522

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

that He is in every place!
These are among the proofs from the Book and the Sunnah.
Thirdly: As for the proof of consensus, since the time of the
Messenger
until today, the Salaf (pious predecessors)
agreed that Allah, Exalted is He, is above the heavens in
His Self.
If you ask: "H ow did they agree?”
We reply by saying that their acknowledgment of these
Ayat and Hadiths with the repetitive mention of 'Ulu,
Fawqiyyah (being above), the descent of things from Him,
and their ascension to Him - without them saying what
opposes that - indicates their consensus upon what they
(the Ayat and the Hadiths) indicate.
That is why Shaykh Al-lslam said: "The Salaf (pious
predecessors) agreed upon that.” He said: "None of them
has said: 'Allah is not above the heavens' or 'Allah is upon
the earth' or 'Allah is neither inside the universe nor
outside it, not connected to it nor separated from it' or 'it is
not allowed to make a perceptible reference to Him.”'
Fourthly: As for proofs based on the intellect, we say: There
is no doubt that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is either
above or below. His being below is impossible because it is
imperfection which implies that something among His
creatures is above Him. So, His 'Ulii would not be
complete, nor would His control be complete, nor His
authority. If His being below is impossible, then being
above is necessary.
There is also another intellectual affirmation, that is to say,
'Ulii is an attribute of perfection in everyone possessing
intellect. So when it is an attribute of perfection, it is
necessary that it be affirmed for Allah, because every
Attribute of absolute perfection is affirmed for Allah.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

523

Our saying "absolute” is a protection against relative
perfection, which will be perfect in a situation, and not in
another situation. Sleep, for example, is an imperfection,
but to the one who is in need of it to make him more
powerful, it is perfection.
Fifthly: As for the proof based on the Fitrah, it is a matter
about arguing and being obstinate are not possible. Every
person instinctually knows that Allah is above the heavens.
That is why if you are suddenly surrounded by a situation
in which you cannot defend yourself, you quickly turn to
Allah to protect you; in such cases, your heart turns
towards the heavens. This happens even to those who
reject the 'li/w of the Self; they cannot turn their hands (in
supplication) towards the ground. This is the Fitrah which
it is not possible to reject.
They even say that some creatures that do not speak know
that Allah is above the heaven; as in the Hadith wherein it is
related that Sulaiman bin Dawud, may the Salah and Salam
be upon him and his father, once came out to beg Allah on
behalf of the people for rain. When he came out, he saw an
ant lying on its back, raising its feet up towards the heaven,
saying: "O Allah, we are a creation among your creations,
we are not independent of your provision of water.” He
then said to the people, "G o back, you will be provided
with the prayer of other than you."^1' This is an inspiration
in the Fitrah.
The summary of the matter is, that Allah is above the
heavens, is a matter that is well-known through the Fitrah.
By Allah, if it were not for the spoiled Fitrah of these people
who reject, they would have known that Allah is above the
heavens without having to consult any book, because a

matter that is proven by the Fitrah does not need any
research in books.
❖

Those who deny the 'Ulii of Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, in His Self, say: If He was High above the
heavens in His Self, He will be in a direction. If He is in
a direction, He is, therefore, limited and physical; while
this is impossible!

We say, the reply to their saying that it implies that He is
limited and physical is:
Firstly, it is not allowed to falsify the textual proofs with
this kind of reasoning. If this was allowed, every person
who does not want what the textual proofs dictate will
justify his own views with this kind of reasoning.
If Allah affirms 'Ulii for Himself, and His Messenger
affirmed 'Ulii for Him, and the Salaf (pious predecessors)
affirmed 'Ulii for Him, it will not be acceptable for some
person to come and say: "It is not possible that His 'Ulii be
of the Self, because if it was of the Self, then He would be
such-and-such."
Secondly: We say, that if what you mentioned was correct
about the implication of affirming 'Ulii, then we will still
say it, because the implication of the speech of Allah and
His Messenger is the truth; since Allah, Exalted is He,
knows what His saying suggests. If the textual proofs
concerning 'Ulii had implied any false meaning, He would
have explained that, but it does not imply any false
meaning.
Thirdly: Then, we are asking what is the limitation and the
body that you heaped upon us with all your might?
By limitation, do you mean that something among creation
will surround Allah? This is false and negated from Allah,
it is not necessitated by affirming 'Ulii for Allah. Or, by

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

525

limitation, do you mean that Allah is separate from His
creation, not within it? This is the truth, based on that
meaning; but we do not use that term, neither as negating
nor affirming, due to what preceded.
As for being physical, what do you mean by a body? Do
you mean a body composed of bones, flesh, skin and the
like? This is false and negated from Allah, because there is
nothing like unto Allah, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing.
Or do you mean by body what sustains itself, being
described with what befits Him? This is the truth, based on
its meaning, but we do not use the term, negating nor
affirming, due to what preceded.
And similarly we say about direction. Do you mean that
Allah, Exalted is He, is in a direction that encompasses
Him? This is false. It is not necessitated by affirming His
'Ulu. Or, by direction, do you mean a direction of
exaltedness that does not surround Allah? This is the truth;
it is not correct to negate it from Allah, Exalted is He.

}A scend the goodly w ords}: }(th e goodly w ords)} (AlKalim) is a noun of a plural category. Its singular is
Kalimah (a word) and the plural of Kalimah is Kalimat
(words). And goodly words comprise all the words
with which one draws nearer to Allah, such as
recitation of the Q ur'an, Uhikr (remembrance of
Allah), seeking knowledge, enjoining good and prohi­
biting evil. Therefore, every word by which one
draws nearer to Allah is a goodly word. It ascends to
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and reaches Him,
and Allah also exalts good deeds to Himself.

Thus, the words ascend to Allah, and the good deeds are
raised up by Allah. Moreover, this shows that Allah is High
in His Self, because things ascend to Him and are raised up.

that he could climb up it and then say: "I did not see

And he did not say: "I do not know ." Rather, he admitted

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, said in another Ayah:

4And they belied them wrongfully and arrogantly,
though their ownselves were convinced thereof. 4 (AnNaml 27:14)
The reference here is that Fir'aw n com m anded the

The One over the heavens is Allah, the Mighty and

in this case, He is exhibiting His greatness, and that He
is above you, that He has power over you, controlling
you, prevailing upon you, because it is the One who is
Exalted that has the control over the one below Him.

❖

iT hen behold it shakes)>: That is, it quakes.

And the reply is that by Allah! We do not feel secure,
rather, we are afraid for ourselves of the earth sinking with
us because, because of our numerous acts of disobedience.
W ith these quakes, which people today refer to as
mudslides, and rock slides, and the like, it is these that
Allah is threatening us with, but they invent these
expressions so that the matter appears less grave to
intellectually immature people.
❖

iW ill not send against you a Hasib (violent whirlwind)?)>:
A Hasib (violent whirlwind) is a punishment from
above, pelting them with stones, as was done with
the people before them were, like Lut, and Ashab AlFil (the owners of Elephants). The collapse of the
earth is from beneath.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

531

Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, threatened us with a
punishment from above, and from beneath. Allah, Exalted
is He, says:

4.So We punished each (of them) fo r his sins, o f them
were some upon whom We sent a Hasib, and o f them
were some who were overtaken by As-Sayhah, and o f
them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow,
and o f them were some whom We drowned^ (Al'Ankabut 29:40)
Four types of punishment (are mentioned in this Ayah).
Here, (in the Ayah under consideration) Allah mentions
two of them: Al-Hasib (a violent wind with a shower of
stones) and the collapsing of the earth.
The point of reference from this Ayah is His statement:
4W ho is above the heavens.$ The One above the heavens is
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and this is a proof of
Allah's 'Ulu in His Self.
However, there is a problem here, and that is the
preposition Ff being used as an adverb. So, since Allah is
Ff the heaven, then (it will be understood that) the adverb
encompasses what it refers to. Do you not see, that if you
say: "T he water is in the cup.” The cup will then
encompass the water, and is wider than the water.
So, if Allah says: $Do you feel secure that He who is in the
heaven$ apparently, this implies that the heavens
surround Allah. This apparent meaning is false. And
when the apparent meaning is false, then we know with

532

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

certainty that it is not what Allah intended, because it is
not possible that the apparent meaning of the Book and
the Sunnah would be false.
Then, what is the response concerning this problem?
The scholars said that the response is from one of these two
paths:
1. That we either understand the meaning of As-Sama'
(heavens) to mean "h ighn ess” since the use of
"heavens" to mean highness is reported in the Arabic
Language, even in the Qur'an. He, Exalted is He, says:

Lojl c J d it. jlUlf
4;He sends down water from the heavens, and the
valleys flow according to their m e a s u r e (Ar-Ra'd
13:17)
What is intended with the As-Sama' (the heavens) here is
highness, because the water descends from the clouds not
from the heavens, which are the preserved roof, while the
clouds in the heights are between the heavens and the
earth, as Allah, Exalted is He, says:

4And the clouds which are held between the sky and the
earth4 (Al-Baqarah 2:164)
Therefore, the meaning of 4W ho is above the heavens.4 is
"O ne in the highness". Then, there is no problem after
this; He is, therefore High; nothing is beside Him, nor
above Him.
2.

Or, we consider the word Ff to mean 'Ala (above), and
consider that the heavens that are the preserved, raised,
roof to be the heavenly bodies. The preposition F i is
used in the Arabic Language, even in the noble Qur'an

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

533

to mean 'Ala (above). Fir'awn said to the magicians those who believed:

iA n d I will surely crucify you Fi the trunks o f datep alm si (Ta Ha 20:71)
That is "O n the trunks of date-palms."
Therefore, the meaning of #Who is Fi the heavens4 is the
one who is above the heavens. Then, there is no problem
after this. If you ask: "H ow do you harmonize between
this Ayah, and His statement, Exalted is He:

4lt is He (Allah) Wlw is the only Ilah in the heavens
and the only Ildh on the earth4 (Az-Zukhruf 43:84)
And His statement:

iA n d He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth, He
knows what you conceal and what you reveal4 (AlAn'am 6:3)?"
Then the reply is that we say: In the case of the first Ayah:
Allah says:

411 is He (Allah) Who is the only Ildh in the heavens
and the only Ildh on the earth.4 (Az-Zukhruf 43:84)
The adverb here refers to His Uliihiyyah (divinity), that is,
His Uliihiyyah (divinity) is affirmed in the heavens and in
the earth, just as you would say: "So-and-so is the Amir in
Al-Madinah and in M akkah," — while he himself, is in

534

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

only one of them. But, in his Imdrah (leadership) and
authority, he is in both, so the Uluhiyyah of Allah, Most
High, is both in the heavens and the earth. But as for
Him, the Mighty and Sublime, then He is above the
heavens.
As for the second Ayah:

}A n d He is Allah (to be worshipped Alone) in the
heavens and on the earth} (Al-An'am 6:3)
We said about it, as we said about the one that preceded it.
$And He is A llah}: That is - He is the Ilah (God) whose
Uluhiyyah (divinity) is in the heavens and the earth. As
for Him, Himself; then He is above the heavens. So the
meaning is that He is the One Who is deified in the
heavens, and the One Who is deified in the earth, so His
Uluhiyyah (divinity) is in the heavens and the earth.
So this Ayah is explained as the Ayah before it is explained.
It is said that the meaning of the Ayah is that you should
recite it:
ii\
}A nd He is Allah (to be worshipped Alone) in the
heavens}
Then you stop; then you recite:

4 And on the earth, He knows what you conceal and
what you reveal} (Al-An'am 6:3)
Meaning that He, Himself, is above the heavens, and He
knows what you conceal, and what you reveal, on the

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

535

earth. Therefore, the fact that He is above the heaven with
His 'Ulu, does not prevent Him from knowing what you
conceal, and what you reveal on the earth. There is a kind
of weakness in this interpretation, because it requires
splitting the Ayah, and not connecting part of it to the other.
The correct interpretation is the first one. That we should
say:
4 u?jV'

cJyAlA 4 Sit

<$And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earthy (AlAn'am 6:3)
Means that His Uliihiyyah (divinity) is affirmed in the
heavens and the earth, so it is in accord with the other
Ayah.
Among the behavioral benefits derivable from this Ayah:
If somebody knows that Allah, Exalted is He, is above
everything, such a person will realize the greatness of His
sovereignty and control upon his creation. Therefore, he
will fear Him and revere Him. If a man fears his Lord, and
reveres Him, he would be beware of disobeying Him, and
fulfill His obligations, and leave what is unlawful.

The Affirmation of Allah Ma'iyyah With His Creation

The Commentary
The author began with the quotation of the proofs of
Allah's Ma'iyyah with His creation; that is, the proofs of

536

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Allah's being with His creation. It is appropriate that he
mentions it after the mention of Al-'Ulu; since it may occur
to a person that there is a contradiction between Him being
above everything, and Him being with His slaves. There­
fore, it is quite appropriate that he mentioned the Ayat that
affirm Allah's Ma'iyyah with His creation, after the mention
of the Ayat concerning Al-'Ulu.
There are some matters regarding Allah's Ma'iyyah with
His creatures that require further discussion:
The First Matter; Its categories:
The Ma'iyyah of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is divided
into two categories: general and specific.
The specific is also divided into two categories: That which
is restricted to a particular person and that which restricted
to a particular description.
As for the general, it is the one which includes everyone,
whether a believer, disbeliever, righteous person and
wicked person. Its evidence is His, Exalted is He,
statement:

4And He is with you wherever you may be* (Al-Hadid
57:4)
A. As for the specific category that is restricted to a particular
description, an example is His, Exalted is He, statement:

iT ru ly , Allah is with those who have Taqwa, and those
who are Muhsinun (good-doers)i (An-Nahl 16:128)
B. As for the specific category that is restricted to a
particular person, an example is His, Exalted is He,

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

537

statement concerning His Prophet:

4And he said to his companion: "Be not sad (or afraid),
surely Allah is with us"4 (At-Tawbah 9:40)
He said to Musa and Harun:

iV erily! I am with you both, hearing and seeing4 (Ta
Ha 20:46)
This (category) is more particular than the specific category
which is restricted to an attribute.
Hence, the Ma'iyyah is of levels: absolutely general, the
specific that is restricted to a description, and the specific
that is restricted to a person.
The most specific category is the category that is restricted
to a person, then the one restricted to a description, then
the one that is general.
So the general Ma'iyyah implies that He encompasses His
creation in knowledge, power, hearing, seeing, controlling
and so on, among the implications of His Rububiyyah
(Lordship). And the specific M a'iyyah, with its two
categories, implies His support and aid.
❖

The Second Matter: Is the Ma'iyyah a reality or a state of
knowledge of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and His
hearing, His seeing, His Power, His Authority and other
than these meanings that are included in His Rububiyyah?

The majority of the Salaf (pious predecessors), may Allah
have mercy upon them, said that it is a reference to the
state of knowledge, hearing, seeing, power and the like.
They, therefore, considered the meaning of His saying:

538

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4And He is with you^ (Al-Hadid 5 7 :4)
To mean: "H e knows about you, hears your words, sees
your deeds, has power over you, He judges among you,”
and the like; they interpreted it with what that implies.
In this book, and in others, Shaikh Al-Islam, may Allah have
mercy upon him, chose the view that it (Ma'iyyah) is a
reality in the real sense, and that Him being with us is a
reality in the real sense; however His being with us is not
like as a person will be with another person, in such a case
where it is possible that he is together with that person in a
particular place, because the Ma'iyyah of Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, is affirmed for Him, while He is in His 'Ulu
(exaltedness). So, He is with us, though He is high over His
Throne, above everything. It is not at all possible that He is
with us in the places that we are.
Based upon this, there is a need to harmonize between it
(Ma'iyyah) and Al-'Ulu.
The author gave this a separate section, and its explanation
will soon come - Allah willing; and (the explanation) that
there is no contradiction between the 'Ulu and the
Ma'iyyah, because there is nothing like Allah in all His
Attributes; so He is High in nearness, near in His
Highness.^'
Shaikh Al-Islam, may Allah have mercy upon him, cited the
example of the moon; he said: "It is said: 'The moon is with
us while we are walking;' while it is in the heavens. And it
is one of the smallest creatures; then, how is that the
Creator, the Mighty and Sublime, can not be with the

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

539

creation, while the creatures are nothing compared to Him,
and He is above His heavens?!”
What he, may Allah have mercy upon him, said, is a
refutation of the proofs used by some people of Ta'til, who
argued against the People of the Sunnah, saying: "You do
not allow Ta'wil, yet you use Ta'wil in the case of Ma'iyyah.
You say the Ma'iyyah means knowledge, hearing, seeing,
power, authority, and the like.”
So, we say that the Ma'iyyah is real according to its reality,
but not in the manner that has been understood by the
Jahmiyyah and their like; that He is with people in every
place, and the interpretation of some of the Salaf (pious
predecessors) that it means knowledge and the like, is an
interpretation with what it implies.
❖

The Third Matter: Is the Ma'iyyah among the Attri­
butes of the Self, or the Attributes of action?

There are some details regarding this:
As for the general Ma'iyyah, it is regarding the Self, because
Allah always was will always continue to encompass His
creation in knowledge, power, authority and other than
that from the meanings of Rububiyyah.
As for the specific Ma'iyyah, it is an Attribute of action,
because it follows the will of Allah; and every Attribute that
goes along with a reason, it is among the Attributes of action.
It has preceded in our discussion that Ar-Rida (pleasure) is
one of the Attributes of action, because it is connected to a
reason. If the reason for which Allah will be pleased exists,
the pleasure will be found; in the like manner is the specific
Ma'iyyah. Once, Taqwa of Allah, or other than it among its
reasons, is found in a person, Allah is with him.
❖

The Fourth Matter: Is it a reality or not?

540

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

We have mentioned that. And that from the Salaf are those
who interpreted it with what it implies, which means that
which it is not possible for a person to see other than it.
And from them are those who said it is according to its
reality, but, that it is a Ma'iyyah that befits Allah, which is
specific to Him.
Furthermore, this is what is clear from the words of the
author here, in this book and others, but, it is to be
protected from false assumptions. Like assuming that Allah
is with us on the earth, and its like, for indeed, this is an
impossible falsehood!
❖

The Fifth M atter Concerning the M a'iyyah: Is there a
contradiction between it and Al-'Ulu?

The answer is that there is no contradiction between them,
due to three perspectives:
The First perspective: Allah mentions both of them
together among what He describes Himself with, if they
were contradictory, Allah would not have described
Himself with both of them.
The Second perspective: We say that there is fundamen­
tally no contradiction between Al-'Ulu and Al-Ma'iyyah,
since it is possible that something to be high while it is with
you. An example being the saying of the Arabs: "The moon
is with us while we are walking, the sun is with us while
we are walking, the star is with us while we are walking"
despite the fact that the moon, the sun and the star are all in
the sky. So, if Al-'Ulu and Al-Ma'iyyah can be combined
with respect to a creature, their combination with respect to
the Creator is more worthy.
Consider that someone is over a high mountain and is
telling the soldiers: "G o to a far place on the battleground,
and I am with you" while he is watching them from afar

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

541

with a telescope and by that he is with them, because he
can now see them, as if they are directly before him, while
he is far from them. Hence the matter is possible with
regard to the creature; how would it not be then possible
with respect to the Creator?
The Third perspective: If it was impractical that they both be
true in the case of a creature, it is not impractical in the case of
the Creator, for Allah is more Magnificent and more Majestic,
and it is not possible that the Attributes of the Creator are
compared to the attributes of the creatures, due to the clear
distinction between the Creator and the creatures.
The Messenger jjg was saying during his journey: "O Allah,
you are the companion (As-Sahib) on the journey, and the
Khalffah regarding my family.” 111 So, he combined between
Him being his companion, and Him being his Khalifah over
his family, whereas this is not possible with respect to the
creature. It is not possible that a person is your companion
on a journey, and at the same time he is your deputy
looking after your household.
It is established in the authentic H adith^ that: "Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, would say when the person praying
says: iA ll praise is due to Allah, the Lord o f the 'Alaminy,
'M y servant praised Me.”'
How many praying persons will say ^All praise is due to
Allah, the Lord o f the 'A l a m i n They are countless.
How many times does a Muslim praying recite ^All praise
is due to Allah, the Lord o f the 'Alamin^ while another

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

recites 4.You (Alone) We worship and You (Alone) we ask fo r
helpy, when each of the two has his own specific
response (from Allah).
The one who recites 4;All praise is due to Allah, the Lord o f
the 'Alamin^, Allah will say to him: "M y servant praised
M e". And the one who recites: $You (Alone) We worship
and You (Alone) we ask fo r h elp }, Allah says to him: "This
is between My servant and I; two halves..."
Therefore, it is possible that Allah is with us in reality,
while He is also above His Throne, above the heavens, in
reality. None will understand that these are contradictory
except he who wants to liken Allah to His creation, and
make the Ma'iyyah of the Creator like the Ma'iyyah of the
creatures.
We have explained the possibility of harmonizing between
the textual proofs about Al-'Ulu and the textual proofs
about Al-Ma'iyyah; so either that is clear, or else it is
obligatory upon the servant to say: "I believe in Allah and
His Messenger, and I trust what Allah said about Himself,
and His Messenger." He should not say: "H ow is that
possible?!" Denying that!
If he says: "H ow is that possible?" We reply (to him): This
question of yours is an innovation. The Companions never
asked such a question; meanwhile they are better than you.
And the one they would question is more knowledgeable,
more truthful, more eloquent and better at advising than
the one you are asking. It is upon you to admit and avoid
asking how? Why? Instead, surrender yourself completely.
Note:
Consider the Ayah, you will discover that all the pronouns
therein are referring to Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He:

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

543

4 He created the heavens and the earth in six days, and
then He Istawa (rose over)} (Al-Hadid 57:4)
(And)

4He knows what goes into the earth} (Al-Hadid 57:4)
And similarly, the pronoun:

So it is obligatory upon us to believe in the apparentness of
the noble Ayah, and that we know with certain knowledge,
that this Ma'iyyah does not dictate that Allah is with us on
the earth. Rather, He is with us, with His Istawa' over the
Throne.
When we believe in this Ma'iyyah, it will cause us to have
awe of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and to have Taqwa
of Him. Thus, it is reported in the Hadith: "The most
virtuous of faith is that you know that Allah is with you
wherever you are."[11
Reported by At-Tabarani in Al-Kabir and Al-Awsat as
found in Majma' A z-Z aw aid (1:60), Al-BayhaqI in Al-Asma
wass-Sifdt (907) and Abu Nu'aim in Al-Hilyah. The Hadith
was graded weak by Al-Albaru in D a'if Al-Jami' (1002). The
Hadith has been stated with the wording: "Purifying the
soul is to know that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, is with
him wherever he is." It was reported by Al-BaihaqI in AsSunan (4:95), Ibn Abi 'Asim in Al-Ahad wal-M athani (1062),
and Al-Fasawl in Al-Ma'rifah wat-Tarikh (1:269), with a
Sahih chain, as found in As-Silsilah As-Sahihah (1064).

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

But as for the people of pantheism, they said: "Allah is with
us in His Self in our places. If you are in the Masjid, then,
Allah is with you in the Masjid. Those who are in the
market, Allah is with them in the market! Those who are in
the toilets, Allah is with them in the toilets!" They never
exalted Him above filth, putridity, and places of vanity and
lewdness.
❖

The Sixth Matter: Concerning the doubts of those who
say that Allah is with us in our places, and the
refutation against them.

Their doubt is that they say this is the clear and obvious
meaning of the statement: iA n d He is with y ou }; because
all the pronouns are referring to Allah:

iH e it is Who created.. A

i . . . and then He Istawa (rose over)...$

i . . . He k n o w s ...i

i . .. and He is with you^ (Al-Hadid 57:4)
If He is with us, we do not understand anything from this
Ma'iyyah except mixing, and accompanying in a place.
The refutation against them is from various perspectives:
Firstly: Its apparentness is not as you have said, since if
what you said was what was apparent from it, there would
be a contradiction between the Ayah : that He rises above
the Throne, while He is with every person in every place!
And, it is impossible that there be a contradiction in the

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

545

speech of Allah, Exalted is He.
Secondly: Your statement that nothing is understood from
the Ma'iyyah except mixing and accompanying in a place!
This is not possible.
Al-Ma'iyyah in the Arabic Language is a noun that is
generally used to convey "accompanying/' and it indicates
a broader meaning than what you have claimed. It can
imply mixing; it can imply accompanying in a place; it can
also imply a general kind of accompaniment, while the
places are different. These are three things:
1. An example of Al-Ma'iyyah that implies mixing, is to
say: "G et me milk with w ater" meaning - one that is
mixed with water.
2. An example of Al-Ma'iyyah that implies being together
in a place, is that you say: "I met so-and-so with soand-so, walking together and descending together."
3. An example of Al-Ma'iyyah that does not imply being
together in a place is to say: "So-and-so is with his
soldiers" even though he is in the command center, yet,
he is directing them. Thus, there is no mixing in this
case, nor being together in a place.
It is said: "The wife of so-and-so is with him " even if she is
in the East while he is in the West.
Therefore, Al-Ma'iyyah - is as said by Shaikh Al-Islam Ibn
Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy upon him, and as
evident from the linguistic proofs - in its general usage
indicates accompaniment, then, it will be in accord with
whatever is attributed to it.
If it is said:

iTruly, Allah is with those who have Taqwa} (An-Nahl 16:128)

546

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

That does not imply mixing nor sharing a place together,
rather, it is a Ma'iyyah that befits Allah; and what it implies
is victory and support.
Thirdly, we say: You describe Allah with this?! Among the
falsest of falsehoods! And worst of deficiencies for Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime! And Allah, the Mighty and Sublime
mentioned it here about Himself as a means of praise; that He
- with His 'Ulu above His Throne - is with the creation, even
though they are below Him. So when you consider Allah to
be on the earth, then this is an imperfection.
If you consider Allah Himself to be with you in every place,
while you enter the toilet; this is the worst of all the forms
of belittling. You cannot say to a king of this world: "You
are in the toilet." So how can you say that to Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime? Is this anything other than the worst
of all defects? And we seek refuge in Allah.!?
Fourthly: This statement of yours will necessitates one of
two matters for which there is no third; and both of them are
impossible: Either Allah is divided into parts; each part of
Him is in a place; or, He is more than one; meaning that every
god is in a certain direction due to the multitude of places.
Fifthly: We say that this statement of yours necessitates
that Allah is dwells within the creation, so every place in
the universe, Allah is in it. This is a means of submission to
the people of Wahdat A l-W ujudP'
You now see that this statement is false and that such
saying dictates disbelief.
That is why we say that whoever says: "Allah is with us on

(Translation note) "Unity of existence" meaning, nothing
exists but Allah; everything is Him, the peak of the
teachings of Tasawwuf and ‘Ilm Al-Kaldm.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

the earth” then he is a disbeliever; he should be asked to
repent while the truth should be explained to him. He then
either repents; or else, executing him is required.
The following are the Ayat that discuss Al-Ma'iyyah:

}H e it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six
days and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne. He knows
what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it,
what descends from the heavens, and what ascends
thereto. And He is with you wherever you may be. And
Allah sees what you d o } (Al-Hadid 57:4)

The First Ayah:

}H e it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six
days and then Istawa (rose over) the Throne. He knows
what goes into the earth and what comes forth from it,
what descends from the heavens, and what ascends
thereto. And He is with you wherever you may be. And
Allah sees what you d o } (Al-Hadid 57:4)

inform them o f what they did. Verily, Allah is the
knower o f everything^ (Al-Mujadilah 58:7)
❖

His statement: 4 There is no^ absolutely, meaning - it
is not found.

❖

His statement: $Najwa (secret counsel) o f threeb; it is
said that it is a way of attaching the description to
what is being described. Its root is "from three in
secret counsel” and the meaning of iN ajw afi is those
who are involved in the secret counsel.

❖

His statement: iB u t He is their fourth^ and He did not
say: "but He is their third” because He is not from
their kind, as such, the next number will be men­
tioned. But if it were of the same kind, the same
number will be mentioned. Consider His, Exalted is
He, statement concerning the Christians:

$ Surely, they have disbelieved who said: "Allah is the
third o f the th r e e .'f (Al-Ma'idah 5:73)
They did not say: "the third of the tw o," because they are
claiming that He is of the same kind! In their view, all the
three are gods, and as they claim, they are from the same
kind, and they said regarding Him: "The third of the
three.”
❖

His statement: 4Nor o f fiv e, but He is their sixthfi - He
mentions the odd numbers three, and five, and is
silent about the even numbers, but they are included
in His statement: iN o r less than that* And what is
less than three is two. Also, 4.Nor morefy than five,
that is six and beyond.

Therefore, there are no two people, or more, engaged in a
secret council anywhere on the earth, except that Allah, the

550

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Mighty and Sublime, is with them.
And this Ma'iyyah is general, because it includes every­
body; the believer, the disbeliever, the righteous and the
wicked. Its implication is that He encompasses them in
knowledge, power, hearing, seeing, authority, arranging
affairs, and other than that.
❖

His statement: iT h en , on the Day o f Resurrection, He
will inform them o f what they did$, meaning - that this
Ma'iyyah implies recording what they did; so that on
the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what
they did. Meaning, He will inform them of it, and
hold them to account for it. This is because what is
intended by informing them is what that implies,
which is reckoning. But if they are believers, Allah,
Exalted is He, will count their deeds and then say: "I
covered them for you in the world, today, I have
pardoned them for y ou ."[1]

❖

His, the Mighty and Sublime, statement: 4 Verily, Allah
is the Knower o f everything4 ’, everything, existing or
not, possible, necessary, or impossible; everything,
Allah knows it.

Earlier we discussed the Attribute of knowledge, and
explained that the knowledge of Allah reaches everything,
whether the necessary or the impossible, the small and the
large, the evident and the hidden.

❖ ❖ ❖

Its reference preceded, and it is in the Two Sahihs.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

}D o not grieve, surely Allah is with u s .} (At-Tawbah
9:40)

The third Ayah: His statement:

}D o not grieve, surely Allah is with u s} (At-Tawbah
9:40)
The address was to Abu Bakr from the Prophet 3g|. Allah,
Exalted is He, says:

} I f you help him not (it does not matter), fo r Allah did
indeed help him when the disbelievers drove him out,
the second o f two, when they were in the cave, and he
said to his com panion: "Do not grieve, surely Allah is
with u s" } (At-Tawbah 9:40)
Firstly: His help when he was driven out. And }W hen the
disbelievers drove him ou t}
Secondly: When they were hiding in the cave, }W hen they
were in the cave}
Thirdly: During the harsh time when the polytheists stood
at the entrance of the cave, }A n d he said to his com panion:
"Do not grieve"}
In these three situations, Allah, Exalted is He, explained

552

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

giving His help to his Prophet % therein.
In this third situation, when the polytheists stood above
them, Abu Bakr said: "O the Messenger of Allah, if anyone
of them looks at his foot, he will surely see u s ."^ Meaning
- 'we are at risk/ which is similar to the statement of the
Companions of Musa when they reached the sea:

$W e are sure to be overtaken4 (Ash-Shu'ara’ 26:61)
Musa said (in response):

4 Nay, verily! With me is my Lord, He will guide me$
{Ash-Shu'ara’ 26:62)
Here, the Prophet
said to Abu Bakr: 4 Do not grieve,
surely, Allah is with us4 to calm him, and bring a sense of
security to his heart, and he gave the reasoning for that,
by saying: p u r e ly , Allah is with us4
❖

His statement here; 4Do not grieve^ is a statement of
prohibition, that includes every form of anxiety that
occurred and that will occur. It can be used for the
past or the future.

Al-Hazin (grief): refers to the pains of the soul, and its
severe concerns.
❖

iS u rely, Allah is with us$, this specific Ma'iyyah,
restricted to the Prophet % and Abu Bakr. It
suggests, in addition to the encompassing which is
the general Ma'iyyah, it implies help and support.

That is why the Quraish stood at the entrance of the cave
[1]

Reported by Al-Bukhari (3653) and Muslim (2381) from
Anas bin Malik, may Allah be pleased with him.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

553

and did not see them. Allah made their vision blind.
As for the statement of the one who said: "A spider came
and weaved a web at the entrance of the cave, and then, a
pigeon flew into the entrance of the cave, so that when the
polytheists came, the pigeon was at the entrance, while the
spider had constructed its nest. They then said: 'Nobody is
here' and then went aw ay ."[1] This is false!!
It was from the divine protection, and as a clear and
convincing sign, that the cave remained open without any
visible barrier; despite that, they could not see who was in
it. This was the sign. But that the pigeon came and the
spider built its nest; this is inconsistent and contrary to his
statement: "If anyone of them looks at his foot, he will
definitely see us."
What is important is that some historians, may Allah
pardon them, report things that are strange, odd and
rejected, which are not acceptable to the intellect nor
conveyed authentically.

And His statement: iV erily , I am with you both,
hearing and s e e i n g (Taha 20:46)

In Al-Majma' (6:53), Al-Haithami attributed it to Al-Bazzar
and At-Tabarani, and said: "In it is a group I do not know."
Also, reported by Ibn Sa'd in At-Tabaqat (1:229). See AdDa'ifah by Al-Alban! (1128), for he has graded it weak.

554

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The Fourth Ayah: His statement:

4 Verily, I am with you both, hearing and seeing.^
(Tdhd 20:46)
This was an address to Musa and Harun when Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, commanded them to go to Fir'awn.
He said:

4 Go, both o f you, to Fir'awn, verily, he has
transgressed. And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may
accept admonition or fear Allah. They said: "Our Lord!
Verily! We fear lest he should hasten to punish us or
lest he should transgress." He sa id : "Fear not, verily! I
am with you both, I hear and I see. "4 (Tdhd 20:43-46)
❖

Thus, His statement: 41 hear and I see} is a new clause
to clarify what this specific Ma'iyyah implies, that that
is the hearing and the seeing, and this specific
hearing and seeing indicates help, support and
protection from Fir'awn, about whom they, both
said:

4W e fear lest he should hasten to punish us or lest he
should transgress4 (Td Ha 20:45)

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

555

And His statement: iT ru ly , Allah is with those who
have Taqwa, and those who are Muhsinun (gooddoers)} (An-Nahl 16:128)

The Fifth Ayah: His statement:

iT ru ly , Allah is with those who have Taqwa, and those
who are Muhsinun (good-doers)i (An-Nahl 16:128)
This came after His statement:

iA n d if you punish, then punish them with the like o f
that with which you were afflicted. But if you endure
patiently, verily, it is better fo r As-Sabirtn. And endure
you patiently, your patience is not but from Allah. And
grieve not over them, and be not distressed because o f
what they p lo ti (An-Nahl 16:126-127)
Punishing the criminal with what is similar to their crime is
an act of Taqwa. But if more, then it will be oppression and
tyranny, while to pardon is Ihsan.
That is why He said:

iT ru ly , Allah is with those who have Taqwa, and those
who are Muhsinun (good-doers)i (An-Nahl 16:128)

556

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Al-Ma'iyyah here is specific, and restricted to the descrip­
tion. All among those who have Taqwa, and the Muhsinin,
then Allah is with them.
As for behavioral benefits, the fruit of this for us is the
desire to do Disdn and to have Taqwa, because every person
loves that Allah would be with him.

And His statement: }A n d be patient. Surely, Allah is
with As-Sabirin (the patient ones)} (Al-Anfdl 8:46)

The sixth Ayah: His statement:

4And be patient. Surely, Allah is with As-Sabirin (the
patient ones)} (Al-Anfdl 8:46)
We have earlier mentioned that As-Sabr (patience) is to
restrain one's self upon Allah's obedience, and to restrain it
away from disobedience to Allah, and to restrain it from
being angry with what Allah has decreed to occur, whether
with the tongue, the heart, or the limbs.
The most virtuous form of patience is patience upon
obedience to Allah, then in staying away from disobe­
dience to Allah; because one has a choice with these two. If
someone wills, he may obey the command, if he wills, he
may not obey. If he wills, he can forsake a prohibited act; if
he wills, he can decide not to forsake it.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

557

Then, the next is patience upon what Allah decrees,
because the decrees of Allah shall occur whether you like
it or not. So you are either honorably patient, or you are
distracted like beasts.
Patience is an exalted rank that cannot be attained except
with something to be patient with. In the case of the person
for whom the ground he walks is cleared away upon his
arrival, and the people stand waiting for whatever he
wants; then there is no doubt that he will suffer exhaustion
of his soul or body, inside or outside.
That is why Allah combined between gratitude and
patience for His Prophet
As for gratitude, he would stand (in prayer) until his feet
became swollen, and he would say: "Should I not be a
grateful servant?"^
As for patience, he was patient with the harm he suffered.
For he was inflicted with harms by his people, and by
others among the Jews and the hypocrites, and with all
that, he was still patient.

And His statement: 4 How often a small group overcame
a mighty host by Allahs Leave? And Allah is with AsSdbirin (the patient ones)4 (Al-Baqarah 2:249)

Its references preceded, and it is in the Two Sahihs.

(>;

}H ow often a small group overcame a mighty host by
Allahs Leave? And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient
ones)} (Al-Baqarah 2:249)
❖

}H ow often}: expressing many, meaning - a small group
overcame a group many times larger, or that many small
groups overcame many larger hosts, but not with their
might nor with their power; it is rather with the permis­
sion of Allah. That is, with His will and power.

An example of such is when the people of Talut overcame
their enemies, though they were larger in number. And the
people of (the Battle) of Badr overcame the Quraish though
they were larger in number.
The people of Badr went out not intending to fight, but to
capture the caravan of Abu Sufyan. When Abu Sufyan
learned of their plan, he cried out to the people of Makkah
saying: "Com e out to rescue your caravan. Muhammad
and his Companions have come out against us to capture
the caravan." And the caravan carried a great deal of
wealth for the Quraish. So, they came out with their chiefs,
their nobles, their pride and their arrogance, displaying
their might, their pride, and their honor, so much so that
Abu Jahl said: "By Allah, we shall not return until we get to
Badr, and we shall stay there for three days. We will be
slaughtering camels, drinking wine, and the songstresses
will be playing music for us. The Arabs will hear of us, and
they will continue to fear us forever."^
111

Reported by Ibn Jarir At-Tabari (6:262) from Ibn 'Abbas,
may Allah be pleased with him.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

559

All praise is due to Allah, now they sing of his death, his
and those who were with him!
These people were between nine hundred and a thousand;
everyday, they slaughtered between nine and ten camels.
On the other hand, the Prophet ^ and his Companions
were just three hundred and fourteen in number/1' with
only seventy camels and two horses, which they alternately
rode. Despite that, they killed the powerful warriors of the
Quraish so much so, that after they were shriveled and
bloated by the sun, they were hauled into one of the wells
of Badr.
So, 4 How often a small group overcame a mighty host by
Allahs Leave? And Allah is with As-Sabirfn (the patient
ones)^ since the small group was patient, 4 And Allah is
with As-Sabirfn (the patient ones).4 They were patient in
all of the forms of patience; upon obedience to Allah,
staying away from disobedience to Allah, and upon the
struggle they were afflicted with, and the exhaustion,
and the difficulties in enduring the stress of Jihad. 4;And
Allah is with As-Sabirfn (the patient ones)}
These Ayat concerning Al-Ma'iyyah (the company of Allah)
end here. A complete chapter from the author, may Allah
have mercy upon him, shall soon come concerning it.
So, what are the fruits that we derive from Allah being with us?
Firstly: Faith that Allah, the M ighty and Sublim e,
encompasses everything, and that with His 'Ulu, He is
with His creation. Nothing of their affairs is hidden from
Him.
Reported by Sa'id bin Mansur in M ur sal form from Abu AlYaman 'Amir Al-Hawzanl. However, At-TabaranI and AlBayhaql have connected it from another route, from Abu
Ayyub Al-Ansari, as said by Al-Hafiz in Al-Fath (7:291).

Secondly: That when we know that and believe in it, that
will make us have a complete sense of awareness that He is
watching us, for which we will continue in obeying Him,
and stay away from disobeying Him, so much that He
would not miss seeing us in what He commanded us, and
He would not find us in what He prohibited us.
And these are the tremendous fruits for whoever believes
in this Ma'iyyah.

}A n d w ho}: is an interrogative pronoun meant to
express a negation. To express a negation with the
use of an interrogative is more profound than using
an ordinary negation. Because with the interrogative,
the challenge is greater, as if you are saying: "None

dictory opinion, then, who is it that is truer than
Allah in speech?"

The affirmation of speech in these two Ayahs is derived
from His statement: }A sdaq (truer)} because truthfulness
is used to describe the speech. And in His saying:
}H adithan } because Al-Hadith is the speech. And in His
statement in the second Ayah: iQ ila n } meaning "saying"
and the saying will not be except by an expression.
Thus, in both of them, there is the affirmation of speech for
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and that His speech is true
and honest; there is nothing false at all in it.

His statement:
'Isa} is a word which is composed
of letters from: 4 0 'Isa, son o f M aryam !}

There is an affirmation in this that Allah speaks, and that
His saying will be heard so it will be by voice, and that His
speech is words and sentences, so it will be with letters.
That is why it is the creed of the People of the Sunnah and
the Jama'ah that Allah speaks with words, in reality,
whenever He wills, as He wills, with what He wills, with
letters and a voice that does not resemble the voices of
creatures.
"Whenever He wills" relates to the time.
"With what He wills" relates to the speech, meaning the topic
of the speech, be it commands, prohibitions or than that.
"In the manner He wills" meaning - how and according to
the description which He wants for that, Glorified and
Exalted is He.
We said that it is with letters and a voice that does not
resemble the voice of the creatures. The evidence for this is
from the noble Ayah:

$And when Allah will say: "O 'Isa, son o f M aryam !"}
(Al-Md'idah 5:116)
These are letters. And it is with voice, because Tsa shall
hear what He said.
It does not resemble the voices of the creatures, because

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The words of Allah, the Mighty and Exalted, are fulfilled
according to these two descriptions; in truth and in justice.
And what is being described as truth is the information,
and what is being described with justice is the judgement.
As such, the scholars of Tafsir say :^ "Truthful in the
information, and just in the judgements."
The words of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, in the
information are truthful; falsehood cannot reach them in
any way, and in the judgements they are just; there is no
oppression in them in any way.
Here, the words are described with truth and justice.
Therefore, they are words, because it is the word which is
said to be true or false.
The fifth Ayah: His statement:

4And to Musa Allah spoke directly (Taklima)} (AnNisd’ 4:164)
❖

4Alldh4 is the doer, so the speech occurred from
Him.

❖

4Taklima4 is an emphasizing infinitive. The scholars
explained that the emphasizing infinitive negates the
possibility of a metaphor. It therefore indicates that
the speech is real speech, since the emphasizing
infinitive negates the possibility of a metaphor.

Consider that you say: "Zaid has com e;" it will be
understood that he, himself, has come. The meaning can
also be: "Zaid's information has com e" even if this is
contrary to what is apparent. But if you emphasize that,
111

See Tafsir Ibn Kathir (2:269).

Commentary On The Introductory N otes...

565

saying: "Zaid, himself, has come” or; "Zaid, it is Zaid that
came” the possibility of it being a metaphor is negated.
So, the speech of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, to Musa is
real speech with letter and voice, which he heard. That is
why there was a conversation between them, as is in Surah
Ta Ha, and others.
The Sixth Ayah: His statement:

4 Among them are to whom Allah sp okef (Al-Baqarah
2:253)
❖

i^Among themfy that is, the Messengers.

❖

<$whom Allah spoke A', The Glorious Name $Allah$ is
the doer of "spoke.” Its object is deliberately omitted,
returning it back to (whom) and the meaning is:
"Allah spoke to him.”

The Seventh Ayah: His statement:

4And when Masa came at the time and place appointed
by Us, and his Lord spoke to him$ (Al-A'raf 7:143)
This Ayah indicates that the speech is related to what He
wants, that is, because the speech is after "cam e” not before
it. That indicates His speech is related to what He wants.
This falsifies the view of whoever said: "H is speech is
meaning, which stands on its own; it does not have any
relation to what He wants” as claimed by the Ash'ariyyah.
And in this Ayah is the falsification of the claim of whoever
claims that it was only Musa who spoke, thereby distorting
His statement, Exalted is He:

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

4And to Musa Allah spoke directly4 (An-Nisa' 4:164)
By making the Glorious Name (Allah) M a n s i i b —
because with this Ayah, it is not possible to make such
claim, nor to distort it.
The Eighth Ayah : His statement:

4And We called him from the right side o f the Mount,
and made him draw near to Us fo r a talk with h im f
(Maryam 19:52)
❖

We called him.y, the pronoun in the nominative
case (the subject) is referring to Allah; while the
pronoun in the accusative case (the object) is referring
to Musa. Meaning that Allah called Musa.

The difference between Al-Munadah (call) and Al-Munajah
(secret council) is that Al-Munadah is (the call) to someone
who is afar, while Al-Munajah is (the talk) with someone
who is near; both of them involve speech.
The fact that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, speaks by AlMunadah and Al-Munajah is included in the saying of the
Salaf. "In the manner He wills.”
So, this Ayah is among the evidences that Allah speaks in the
manner He wills, whether by Al-Munadah or Al-Munajah.

(Translation note): Reciting the last letter of the word
"Allah" with Fathah (Allaha) as if "Allah" is the object of
"spoke" rather than reciting it with Damma (Allahu) in
which Allah is the speaker.

The Tenth Ayah: His statement:

4 And their Lord called out to the two o f them : "Did I
not forbid you from that tree."4 (A l-A 'raf7: 22)
❖

4 called out to the two o f them$ the pronoun in the
accusative case (the object) is referring to Adam and
Hawwa'.

❖

4Did 1 not forbid you from that tree.4 He is
acknowledging that He forbade them from that tree.
This indicates that Allah had spoken to them before,
and that the speech of Allah is with voice and letters.
And it indicates that is related to what He wants,
based on His statement: 4Did I not forbid you)/-’,
because this statement was after the prohibition; it
will therefore be related to what He wants.

The Eleventh Ayah:

4And the day He will call to them, and say: "What
answer gave you to the Messengers? " f (Al-Qasas
28:65)
Meaning — "remember the day when He will call them,"
and that is the Day of Resurrection. The One Who will call
is Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and 4He will say$
So this Ayah affirms speech from two ways: the call and the
saying.
And collectively, these Ayat prove that Allah speaks with
speech in reality, whenever He wills, with what He wills, as
He wills, with letters and a voice that is audible. It does not
resemble the voices of the creatures.

The Affirmation that the Qur'an is the Speech of Allah

The Commentary
Then, the author, may Allah have mercy upon him,
mentioned the Ayat that proving that the Qur'an is the
speech of Allah.
Many disagreements occurred surrounding this issue,
between the Mu'tazilah and the People of the Sunnah,
which resulted in a tremendous amount of evil being
inflicted upon the People of the Sunnah. Among those that
suffered harm for Allah's sake regarding that was Imam
Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy upon him, the
Imam of the People of the Sunnah. The one about whom
some scholars said: "Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He,
preserved Islam (or they said: aided it) by Abu Bakr during
the day of Apostasy, and by Imam Ahmad during the day
of the Mihnah (inquisition)."111
The Mihnah was when Al-Ma'mun, May Allah pardon us
and him, forced people to say that the Qur'an is created;
such that he began to hold inquisitions with the scholars,
and he killed them if they refused to say so. Most of the
It was said by 'All bin Al-Madlm, in that which was
reported from him by Al-Hafiz 'Abdul-Ghani Al-MaqdisI,
in his book Mihnah Al-Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal (volume 31).
Also, see Siyar A'lam Al-Nubala' (11:196).

570

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

scholars saw that there was some leeway in the matter, and
they began to make Ta'wil:
— Either that the situation was one of duress, and if one
under duress says a statement of disbelief, but is convinced
in his heart of faith, then such a person is pardoned.
— Or, that the statement be intended as other than is
obvious; making Ta'wil, saying for example — and using
his fingers to count — "The Qur'an, the Tawrah, the Injll
and the Zabur; all these are creatures” referring to his
fingers.
As for Imam Ahmad, and Muhammad bin Nuh, may Allah
have mercy upon both of them, they refused that and said:
"The Qur'an is the speech of Allah, revealed, not created.”
They saw that coercion in this case did not justify them
saying what is contrary to the truth; since that situation
was one of a Jihad, and that coercion is pardonable in the
case of a personal matter. That is, if it has to so with a
person himself. But when the issue is about the preserva­
tion of Allah's Shari'ah, then it is obligatory for the person
to put his neck forward in order to preserve the Shan ah of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.
If, during that time, Imam Ahmad had said that the Qur'an
is created, even if it was due to Ta'wil or because of
coercion; then all of the people would have said that the
Qur'an is created, in which case, the Islamic society could
have changed, all because of coercion. But he was whole­
heartedly determined, so the end became his. And to Allah
is the praise.
What is important is that speaking about the Qur'an is part
of speaking about the Speech of Allah in general. But when
the Mihnah fell into that, and the severe disagreement
occurred between the Mu'tazilah and the People of the
Sunnah regarding it, the scholars usually single out a

discussion concerning the Qur'an.
The author, may Allah have mercy upon him, now begins
to cite the Ayat that establish that the Qur'an is the Speech
of Allah:

}A n d if anyone o f the polytheists seeks your protection
then grant him protection, so that he may hear the
Word o f A llah} (At-Tawbah 9:6)
❖❖❖

The First Ayah:

}A n d if anyone o f the polytheists seeks your protection
then grant him protection, so that he may hear the
Word o f A llah} (At-Taivbah 9:6)
❖

Concerning His statement: }Seeks your protection}
meaning seeking your protection -safeguard and
defense.

❖

}S o that he may hear}: }S o that} expresses the purpose;
meaning — if anyone seeks your protection, grant him
the protection so that he can hear the Word of Allah;
that is the Qur'an, and this is agreed upon.

He, only said: }T hen grant him protection, so that he may
hear the Word o f A llah} because listening to the Word of
Allah, Mighty and Sublime, is definitely effective as He,
Exalted is He, says:

understands it completely.

attributed the word to Himself. He said: iT h e Word o f

Allah; and it is such.

And the creed of the People of the Sunnah and the
Jama ah regarding the Qur'an is that they say: The
Qur'an is the Word of Allah, revealed, not created, it
initiated from Him, and to Him it returns.

— Their saying: "W ord of Allah:" its evidence is His
saying, Exalted is He:

4 Then grant him protection, so that he may hear the
Word o f Allah)* (At-Tawbah 9:6)
And other Ayat which follow.
— Their saying: "revealed:" its evidence is His statement,

We have revealed it by stagesi (Al-lsra' 17:106)
— Concerning their saying: "not created/' its evidence is
His statement, Exalted is He:

iS u rely, His is the Creation and the Command^ (AlA'rdf 7: 54)
So, He made the creation one thing and command another,
because the use of a conjunction dictates variance, and the
Qur'an is from the command, based upon His statement,
Exalted is He:

iA n d thus We have revealed to you Ruhan (an
Inspiration) from Our Command. You knew not what is
the Book, nor what is faith. But We have made it a light
wherewith We guide whosoever o f Our slaves We w illi
(Ash-Shura 42:52)
So, if the Qur'an is a command, and it is different than the
creation, it is therefore not a creature. This is because if it is
a creature, then, division into two categories will not be
correct. This is a textually revealed evidence.
As for the intellectual evidence, we say the Qur'an is the

574

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Speech of Allah. And the Speech is not an individual that
maintains itself such that it can be separate from Allah. If it
was an individual maintaining itself, separate from Allah,
then we would have said that it is created. But, speech is an
attribute of the one who utters it; if it is an attribute of the
one who utters it and is from Allah, then it is not a creature;
because all the Attributes of Allah, the Mighty and
Sublime, are not creatures.
Besides, if it was a creature, then what is indicated by the
commands, prohibitions, information and enquiry would
be false, because if these modes were creatures, they would
be considered mere forms that were just created in such
fashion, not indicating meanings, such as the forms of the
stars, the sun, the moon and the like.
— Concerning their saying: "it initiated from H im :"
meaning — He is the One that initiated it, and first Spoke it.
The Qur'an is attributed to Allah, and to Jibril, and to
Muhammad #|:
An example of the first is the statement of Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime:

iT h en grant him protection, so that he may hear the
Word o f Allah4 (At-Tawbah 9:6)
It therefore initiated from Him. That is, from Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime.
An example of the second - its attribution to Jibril - is His,
Exalted is He, statement:

4 Verily, this is the saying o f a most honorable
messenger. Possessing power, and a high rank with the

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

575

Lord o f the Throne^ (At-Takwir 81:19-20)
An example of the third — its attribution to Muhammad ^
— is His statement:

$That this is verily, the word o f an honored Messenger
[(Muhammad
which he has brought from Allah] it is
not the word o f a p o et: little is that you believe$ [A lHacjcjoh (69): 41, 42])
But, it was attributed to both of them (Jibril and the
Prophet) because they convey it, not because it began from
both of them.
— And their saying: "to Him it returns," there are two
views about its meaning:
Firstly: That it is as reported in some reports, that it will be
ascended with during a night, and people will wake up not
finding the Qur'an before them; neither in their hearts nor
in their Mushafs. Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, would
have raised it unto Himself.111

Based upon what was reported by 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud
from him, that: "The Qur'an is to be taken from between
yourselves. A night would pass on it, then it would be
gone from the A jw af (hearts) of men. Thus, not a thing
remains from it." Also, reported by At-TabaranI, and its
narrators are the narrators of the
Sahih, except for
Shaddad bin Ma'qil; and he is trustworthy. As stated in
Majma' A z-Z aw aid (7:330). Ibn Hajar said: "Its chain is
Sahih, but it is M aw quf" Fath Al-Bdri (13:16). Similar to it, is
Sahili in Marfu' form from the Hadith o f H udhaifah. Reported
by Ibn Majah, and Al-Hafiz said its chain is strong in Al-Fath
(13:16). See As-Sahihah by Al-Albani (87).

576

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

This will happen — and Allah knows best — when the
people begin to turn away from it in its entirety. They
would not recite it with their tongue, nor believe it, nor act
upon it. So it will be raised, because the Qur'an is more
honorable than to remain among people who deserted it,
turned away from it, and refused to give it its proper due.
This — and Allah knows best — is like the demolition of
Ka'bah, during the end of time;[1] when a short, bowlegged
and black man from Ethiopia comes with his army, from
the sea, to Al-Masjid Al-Haram, and he dismantles the
Ka'bah stone by stone. Each time he removes a stone, he will
extend it to the one beside him. And like that, they will
continue in passing the stones along, until they will cast
them into the sea. And Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, will
make this possible for them, even though Abrahah came
and tried that with his horsemen, infantry, and elephants,
and Allah destroyed him before he reached the Masjid,
because Allah knew that He would send this Prophet, and
that the reverence and exaltation of the Masjid would
return to it.
But at the end of time, no Prophet will be sent after
Based upon what was reported by Imam Ahmad from
'Abdullah bin 'Amr, that he said: "I heard the Messenger
of Allah ife saying: 'The Ka'bah will be demolished by Dhu
As-Suwaiqatain from Ethiopia. He will take away its
adornments, and strip away its Kiswa. And it is as if I am
looking at him, bald, with contorted calves, striking it with
his shovel and axe." And it is in Al-Bukhari (1591) and
Muslim (2909) from Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased
with him, who said: "The Messenger of Alah gjj| said: 'The
Ka'bah will be demolished by Dhu As-Suwaiqatain from
Ethiopia." See the book Ashrdt As-Sa'ah by Shaikh Yusuf
Al-Wabil (page 231).

Muhammad
So, when people eventually turn away
from revering this House, then this Ethiopian man will be
empowered over it. This is the similitude of the lifting of
the Qur'an. And Allah knows best.
The second view concerning the meaning of their saying:
"To Him it returns” is that it will return to Allah in
description. That is, no one other than Allah is described
with it. So, the One speaking the Qur'an is Allah, the
Mighty and Sublime, and He is the One described with it.
And there is nothing that prevents us from saying that both
of these meanings are correct.
This is the statement of the People of the Sunnah and the
Jama'ah concerning the noble Qur'an.
The Mu'tazilah held the view that the Qur'an was created,
and that it is not the Word of Allah. They tried to prove
that with the statement of Allah, Exalted is He:

iA llah is the Creator o f all things, and He is the Wakil
(Trustee, Disposer o f affairs, Guardian, etc.) over all
things} (Az-Zumar 39:62)
They said the Qur'an is a thing, and thus falls under the
generality of His statement: 4AU things^
And because there is nothing except it is either a creator or
a creature; and Allah is the Creator while all things, other
than Him, are creatures.
The response to this is from two angles:
First: That the Qur'an is the Word of Allah, Exalted is He,
and an Attribute of Allah, and the Attributes of the Creator
are not creatures.
Secondly: That this kind of expression $All things$ is

general which could refer to what is specific, such as His
statement, Exalted is He, concerning the Queen of Saba':

iA n d she has been given all th in g s.i (An-Naml 27:23)
While there many things did not fall under her authority,
such as the dominion of Sulaiman.
❖

If someone asks: Is there any major difference between
our saying that it is revelation and saying that it is
created?

The answer is yes, there is a great difference between them.
The great inquisition (Al-Mihnat Al-Kubrd) abided because
of this during the time of Imam Ahmad.
So when we say it is revelation, it is what is found in the
Qur'an. Allah, Exalted is He, says:

iB lessed be He Who revealed the criterion to His slaved
(Al-Furqan 25:1)
If we say it is created, it implies:
Firstly: Belying the Qur'an, because Allah says:

4And thus We have revealed to you Ruhan (Inspiration)
from Our Command^ (Ash-Shura 42:52)
Allah, Exalted is He, referred to it as revelation to the
Messenger jgj;. If it was a creature, then it would not be correct
to refer to it as a revelation. Since it is revelation, it cannot be a
creature, because Allah is the One Who Spoke it.
Secondly: If we say that it is a creature, that will necessitate

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

579

that the commands, prohibitions, information and enquiry
it indicates are all false, since if all these modes were
creatures, they would just be mere objects that were created
in those forms, like the sun was created in its form, the
moon in its form, the star in its form, and the like. Then,
there will not be any command, prohibition, information
and enquiry.
For example, the statement: "Say,” "D o not say,” "Som e­
body said” and "Did So-and-so say?” - all of these would
be regarded as merely being inscribed in these forms. So
their indication of any command, prohibition, information
and enquiry would be false. So, they would remain like
pictures and inscriptions that do not imply anything.
As such, in An-Nuniyyah, Ibn Al-Qayyim said: "This saying
would falsify the commands and prohibitions. Because the
command would be understood as something that was
created in this form, without any actual implication. And
the prohibition would be created with this form, without
any objective of an actual implication. And the same with
the information and the enquiry.”
Thirdly: If we say that the Qur'an is created, and that His
attribution of it to Himself is as an attribution of a creature,
it would be correct that we say every word of humans and
other creatures is the word of Allah, since every word of
creation is a creature. This is what happened to the people
of pantheism and those who claim unity of existence, such
that one of them said:

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

And this implication is false, and when the implication is
false, what it implies is also false.
So these are three views falsifying the saying that it (the
Qur'an) is created.
The fourth view: That we say, if you allow that speech which is a meaning that cannot stand on its own except
with a speaker - is a creature, it necessitates that you allow
that all the Attributes of Allah are creatures, since there is
no difference. Therefore, say: His hearing is a creature; His
seeing is a creature, etc.
If you refuse, and say that the hearing is a meaning that is
particular to the hearer; it can neither be heard from him
nor seen; unlike the word which is possible that Allah
creates voices in the air and by that be heard.
We would say to you that if He had created voices in the air
and they are heard, then what is heard will be considered
an attribute of the air. You, yourselves, do not say this.
How can you consider an attribute to belong to other than
the one it is described with?
Together, these four views prove that saying the Qur'an is
created is a false saying. If there was nothing wrong with it
except that it would invalidate the commands, prohibi­
tions, information and enquiry (contained in the Qur'an),
then that would be enough.

seventy men in order that they should be with him,
at the time and place appointed by Allah, Exalted is
He.
Allah spoke to him while they were listening. Then, they
knowingly altered the Word of Allah, Exalted is He, after
they had understood it. I have not seen any scholar of Tafsir
indicating that it means the first interpretation.
In either case, in it is an affirmation that the Word of Allah
is a voice that can be heard. And the Word is the Attribute
of the One Who Spoke it; it is not something separate from
him. So it necessitates that the Qur'an is the Word of Allah,
not the word of other than Him.
❖

iT hen they used to change it knowingly after they
understood it$; iT h ey used to change ify meaning - they
changed its meaning.

❖

Concerning His statement: iA fter they understood it
while they know }: This is the worst of all their deeds
and their audacity against Allah, G lorified and
Exalted is He, that they changed anything after they
had understood it, and it reached their intellect while
they knew that they were distorting it. This is
because the one who ignorantly alters the meaning
(of something) has committed a less abominable error
than the one who changes it (the meaning) after
comprehension and knowledge.

The third Ayah: His statement:

}T hey want to change Allah's Words. S ay: "You shall
not follow u s; thus Allah has said beforehand."} (AlFath 48:15)
❖

In this Ayah, there is an affirmation of the fact that the
Qur'an is the Word of Allah, based on His statement:
}T hey want to change Allah's Words. S ay: "You shall
not follow u s; thus Allah has said beforehand." }

The pronoun refers to the Bedouins, about whom Allah
said in their regard:

These Bedouins wanted to change Allah's Words by going
out with the Messenger jjgj but Allah, Exalted is He, had
decreed the spoils for some particular people - that is those
who fought at Hudaybiyyah. But as for those who followed
just to take the spoils, they did not have any right therein.

that. It is not possible for anybody to change the universal
words of Allah.
If Allah decrees that one will die, none can change that. If
Allah, Exalted is He, decrees that one will be poor, none
can change that. If Allah, Exalted is He, decrees drought,
none can change that. All these matters that occur in the
universe occur from His word, based upon His statement,
Exalted is He:

4 Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is
only that He says to it, "Be!" and it is!4 (Yasin 36:82)
But as for the legislative (Shar'iyyah) words, they can be
changed by the disbelievers or the hypocrites. They change
the words, either in meaning, or expression - if they can - or
both.

The Fifth A y a h : His statement:

i Verily, this Qur'an narrates to the Children o f Israel

The point of reference is His statement: ^Narrates$ (Yaqussu)
since narrating cannot be except with saying. So, if the
Qur'an is the one that narrates, then it is the Word of
Allah, since Allah, Exalted is He is the One Who related
this narration. Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He, says:

$W e relate unto you the best o f stories through Our
Revelations unto you, o f this Qur'an.$ (Yusuf 12:3)

iA n d this4 refers to Qur'an.

❖

His statement: 4 Blessed4 meaning; possessing blessing.

Thus, it is blessed because it is a remedy for what is in the
chests. If someone reads it while pondering and reflecting
upon it, it then heals the heart of the disease. Allah, Exalted
is He, has said:

4And We send down from the Qur'an that which is a
healing and a mercy to those who believe4 (Al-Isra' 17:
82)
It is blessed for whoever follows it; since with it deeds may
be righteous, externally and internally.
It is blessed for its marvelous effects. The Muslims have
striven against the lands of the disbelievers with it, for
Allah says:

588

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

iB u t strive against them with the utmost endeavor,
with it$ (Al-Furqdn 25:52)
The Muslims were victorious in the Eastern and the
Western lands with this Qur'an, such that they gained
authority over them.
If we return to it, we shall gain authority over the East and
the West of the world, as was done by our predecessors.
We beseech Allah for that.
It is blessed, in that w hoever recites it, then he will earn
the reward of ten good merits for every letter of it
recited.
For the word, Qal for example, there are thirty
good merits. This is from the blessings of the Q ur'an. We
earn great quantities of goodness by the recitation of a
few Ayat of the W ord of Allah, the M ighty and Sublime.
The summary of the matter is that the Qur'an is a blessed
Book. Every form of blessing results with this magnificent
Qur'an.
❖

The point of reference is in His statement: 4Wluch We
have revealed4

The affirmation of its revelation from Allah is a proof that it
is the Word of Allah.

Based on what was reported by At-Tirmidhi (2910) and the
wording is his, Ad-Darim! (3190), Al-Hakim (1:555) and he
said it is Sahih, and Abu Nu'aim in Al-Hilyah (6:263) from
the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased with him,
from the Prophet
that he said: "Whoever recites a letter
from the Book of Allah, then for it, he gets a Hasanah (good
merit) and the Hasanah is ten times its like. I do not say
that: Alif-Lam-Mim is a letter, rather A lif is a letter, Lam is a
letter and Mim is a letter.'' And At-Tirmidhi said: "The
Hadith is Hasan Sahih Gharib from this route."

4Had We sent down this Qur'an upon a mountain, you

Qyt

iH a d We sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain, you
would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending
asunder by the fear o f Allahfy (Al-Hashr 59:21)
A mountain is among the hardest of what there is, the rocks
by which the mountain becomes firm are exemplary in
hardness. Allah, Exalted is He, says:

lit jt

^ iu;S & £

SSs 'ff

iT h en , after that, your hearts were hardened and
became as stones or even worse in hardness^ (AlBaqarah 2:74)
If this Qur'an were to be sent down upon the mountain,
you would surely see this mountain humbling itself and
cleaving out of the fear of Allah.
4 Humbling^ that is, submissively.
And from its severe fright of of Allah, ^Rending asunder} it
cleaves and tears apart.
And this is sent down upon our hearts, and our hearts -

590

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

except as Allah wills - contract and become hard, neither
opening nor accepting.
As for those who believe, when the Ayat (of the Qur'an) are
sent down to them, it increases their faith; but as for those
who have a disease in their hearts; it adds filth to their filth;
and it is Allah whose refuge is sought!
The meaning of that is that their hearts become more
inflexible and hardened and it adds filth to their filth. We
seek refuge in Allah from that.
If this Qur'an were to be sent down to the mountain, it
would cleave and humble itself due to the greatness of
Allah's Words sent down upon it.
In this, there is evidence that the mountains have senses,
because it humbles itself and cleaves. The matter is like
that. The Prophet
said concerning Uhud: "This is Uhud,
a mountain that loves us, and which we lo v e ."^
With this Hadith, we also recognize the refutation against
those who affirm that there are metaphors in the Qur'an.
Those who always raise their flag, using this Ayah as proof:

4Then they found therein a wall wanting to collapsed
{Al-Kahf 18:77)
Saying: "H ow can the wall w ant?'' We say: Subhdn Allah!
The Knowing, and the Aware sa y s: ^Wanting to collapse^ and
you are saying that it does not want! Is this sensible?
It is not your right, after this, that you say: "H ow could it
want?"

[1]

Reported by Al-Bukhari (4422) and Muslim (1392) from
Abu Humaid As-Sa'idi, may Allah be pleased with him.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

591

This makes us ask ourselves: Are we given the knowledge
of everything?
The answer is that we are not given knowledge, except a
little.
It is not possible for us to object to the statement of the One
Who knows the hidden and the witnessed: 4 Wanting to
collapse^ by saying: "The wall does not have an Iradah (a
want)! And It does not want to collapse!"
This is one of the evils of metaphors, because it implies a
negation of what the Qur'an affirms.
Is it not Allah, Exalted is He, Who says:

iT h e seven heavens and the earth and all that is
therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but
glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their
glorification4 (A l-lsra' 17: 44)
Do they glorify Him, without wanting to?
He says: 4 Tusabbih Lahu (they glorify Himfy: the Lam is to
specify. Thus, it means sincerely. Is it imaginable to have
sincerity without an Iradah (volition, objective, will)?
Therefore, they will, and everything wills, for Allah says:
4And there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise.$ I think it
is clear to all of us that this is one of the ways of
expressing generality, because In (here) means Md (not),
which negates. Also, 4A things is an indefinite pronoun
used in the context of negation. 4But glorifies His Praise^
by that, it includes everything.
O my Muslim brother, if you see that your heart is not
moved by the Qur'an, accuse yourself, because Allah has

His, the Mighty and Sublime, statement: 4 And when

replaced it with another Ayah; whether He abrogated it in
its wording, or in its ruling.
❖

His statement: }A n d Allah knows best o f what He
reveals} , this is a clause of refutation. It is among the
best of what be for this context. The meaning is that

594

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

Our replacement of an Ayah with another, is neither an
act of foolishness, nor mere folly; rather it is based
upon knowledge of what will benefit the creation. We
therefore change an Ayah in place of another for what
We know is better and more beneficial for creation.
There is also another benefit in this, and that is this change
is not from the doing of the Messenger
it is rather from
Allah. He sent it down with His knowledge, and changed
an Ayah in place of another with His knowledge, not from
you, O Messenger.
Allah, Exalted is He, says:

i i g jt T & £
4And when Our Clear Ayat are recited unto them,
those who hope not fo r their meeting with Us, say:
"Bring us a Qur'an other than this, or change it ."4
(Yunus 10:15)
What was the response? The response was by responding
to part of their statement, and leaving some. So, He,
Exalted is He, says:

4 S a y : "It is not fo r me to change it on my own
accord."4 (Yunus 10:15)
He did not say: "I will not bring a Qur'an other than this."
Why is that? Because it may be that he would bring a
change from Allah, and if he is not able to change it, then
bringing other that it is much more impossible.
The point here is that the One Who changes an Ayah in
place of another, whether it is its wording, or its rulings, is

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

His statement:

❖

His statement: }M u ftari (forger, liar)^ — that is, a liar

today you are telling us another thing. This is a lie.

to

But this statement which they were saying concerning him
bringing an Ayah in replacement of another, is foolishness.
If they had carefully observed, they could have surely
known that the One Who changed the Ayah in the place of
another is Allah, Glorified be He. This indicates his jf|
honesty, because a liar will always beware of saying what
contradicts what he earlier said, for fear of his lies being
exposed. If he was a liar, as they asserted — and that was a
sign of lie — he would not have brought what contradicted
his first statement. This is because if he had said what
contradicted the first statement — as they claimed — his lie
would have been clearly evident. Rather, his bringing what
contradicted the first is a proof of his integrity and
trustworthiness, without doubt.
That is why He said here: }N a y , but most o f them know
n o t.} This is a rebutting fact. Its meaning is - rather you
are not a M uftari but most of them know not. If they had
been from among the knowledgeable, they could have
known that if an Ayah is changed in place of another,
that is indeed a proof of the honesty of the Messenger
M❖ His statement, Exalted is He: } S a y : "Ar-Ruh Al-Qudus

because he was free from betrayal, may the Salah and

Salam be upon him. That is why He says in another
Ayah:

iV erily, this is the Word o f a most honorable
messenger. Possessing power, and high rank with the
Lord o f the Throne. Obeyed (by the Angels), trust­
worthy there (in the heavens) } (At-Takwtr 81:19-21)
❖

His statement: 4 From your Lord}: He said: } From your
Lord} and did not say: "from the Lord of the
worlds" indicating, by that, the specific Lordship.
The Lordship of Allah over the Prophet ^ is the
most specific of all kinds of Lordship.

❖

His statement: }W ith truth}, this is either a
description of the one who descends, or what was
descended with.

If it is a description for the one who descends, it means that
this descent is truth, not a lie. But if it is a description for
what was descended with, it means that what was brought
is truth.
Each of them is intended. It is the truth from Allah, and it
descended with truth.
Allah, Exalted is He, says:

}A n d with truth We have sent it down, and with truth
it has descended4 (Al-Isra 17:105)
So, the Qur'an is truth, and what descended with it is truth.

His statement: iA n d as a guidance and glad tidings to
those who have subm ittedi, that is - a guidance with
which they are guided, a lamp by which their way is
lightened, and glad tidings with which they may

It is glad tidings, because whoever acts upon it, and
submits himself to it; that is a proof that he is among the

devoted to it. He should be happy, because this is form
of glad tidings for him, because when the Messenger jg;
was talking to his Companions, he said: "There is none of
you except that his seat in Paradise has been written down,
and his seat in the Fire has been written down.” They
asked: Then, should we leave performing good deeds and
just rely?” He replied: "N o, you should do works, for
everyone will be facilitated for what he has been created
for.” Then, he recited:

If you see that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, has favored
you with guidance, doing what is right, righteous deeds,
and the love of goodness and the people of goodness, then
be glad; because that is an indication that you are among
the people of the ease, those for whom happiness has been
written for. Thus, He said here: }A n d as a guidance and glad
tidings to those who have submitted}
❖

His statement: }A n d indeed We know that they s a y : "It
is only a human being who teaches h im ." }

He said: }A n d indeed We know }, He did not say: "W e
have indeed known” because this statement of disbelief
of theirs can be said again and again; so using the
present tense here is better than using the past tense,
because if He had said: "W e have indeed known” some
people might have understood that the meaning of that
is "W e knew that they had said so” and not that they
continue in that.
The cause of revelation for this Ayah was that the Quraish
said: "This Qur'an that Muhammad is bringing is not from
his Lord. Rather, it is from someone who teaches him, and
narrates the stories of the early generations to him. Then he
comes to and says to us: 'This is from Allah.'” I seek refuge
from Allah!!
They claimed that it is the word of a human being. It is
quite amazing that they claimed it is the word of a human

being, while it had been said to them: "Bring its like” and
they could not.
Allah falsified this defamation of theirs, while He, Exalted
is He, says: iT h e tongue o f the man they refer to is foreign^
the meaning that } Yulhidun (they deviate) } because this
saying of theirs is a deviation from what is correct, and
far from the truth.
❖

Also, Al-A'jami refers to one who does not speak well,
even if he is an Arab, but Al-'Ajmi - without a Hamza is an ascription to 'Ajam (non-Arab) even when he
speaks Arabic. This tongue which they refer to is
foreign, it cannot articulate well in the Arabic Language.

But as for the Qur'an, Allah has said regarding it: iW h ile
this is a clear Arabic tongue}, it, itself, is clear, and
clarifying for others.
The Qur'an is Arabic speech, and is the most eloquent of all
words. How can it come from this ineloquent man one who
cannot clearly express himself?
The point of reference is in His statement: }A n d Allah
knows best o f what He reveals} , and His statement: } S a y :
" Ar-Ruh Al-Qudus has brought it down from your Lord^
and His statement: }W hile this is a clear Arabic tongue}
All of this proves that the Qur'an is the Word of Allah sent
down from Him.
The author left the Ayah which follows after these because
there is no point of reference therein; but it is beneficial, so
we will mention it. He, Exalted is He, says:

600

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

iV erily! Those who believe not in the Ayat o f Allah,
Allah will not guide them and theirs will be a painful
torment. It is only those who believe not in the Ayat o f
Allah, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are
liars> (An-Nahl 16: 104-105)
The meaning of this Ayah is that those who do not believe
in the Ayat of Allah, He will not guide them, and they will
not benefit from His Ayat - We seek refuge with Allah - so
guidance is obstructed from them.
There is a great benefit in this reality, and that is whoever
disbelieves in the Ayat of Allah, Allah will not guide him.
And by understanding the opposite; whoever believes in
the Ayat of Allah, Allah will guide him.
An example of that: We find someone who does not believe
in the Ayat; and he is not guided to the explanation behind
it, such as the statement of some people asking: "H ow does
Allah descend to the lowest heaven, while He is High
(above the heavens)?"
We answer him saying: Believe and you will be guided. If
you believe that He descends in reality, you will know that
this is not impossible, because it is with respect to Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, and none is like Him.
We hear some people saying about His statement, Exalted
is He:

iA wall wanting to collapse and he set it up straight^
(Al-Kahf 18:77)
Asking: "H ow does a wall w ant?"
We say: Believe that the wall can want, and it will become
clear to you that this does not sound strange and odd.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

601

It is necessary that you take this principle as a precept and
that is: "Believe and you will be guided.”
Those who do not believe in the Ayat of Allah, Allah will
not guide them; they will be blinded to the Qur'an - may
Allah save us - and they will not be able to be guided by it.
We ask Allah for guidance, for us and you.
W hat Behavioral Benefits We Derive from these Ayat:
We learn that if we believe that the Lord of the worlds did
Speak this Qur'an, then that will cause us to revere this
Qur'an, and believe in its sanctity, implement the com­
mands it came with, and abstain from the prohibitions and
warnings that are contained in it, and trust whatever
information that comes in it about Allah, Exalted is He, and
His creatures of the past and what is to come.

Affirming that the Believers will see their Lord on the
Day of Resurrection

The Commentary
The author, may Allah have mercy upon him, mentioned
Ayat that affirm seeing Allah, Exalted is He.

^Sotne faces that Day shall be Nadirah (shining and
radiant). Looking at their Lordfy (Al-Qiyamah 75:22-23)

602

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The First A yah: His statement:

iS om e faces that Day shall be Nadirah (shining and
radiant). Looking at their Lordfy (Al-Qiydmah 75:22-23)
❖

His statement: ^Some faces that Dayfy, what is meant
by that is the Last Day.

❖

His statement: ^Nadirah4, that is — beautiful; derived
from An-Nadarah, with the letter Ad-Dad, and it is
beauty. Proving that, is His statement, Exalted is He:

iS o Allah saved them from the evil o f that Day, and
gave them Nadratan (a light o f beauty) and jo y } (AlInsan 76:11)
Meaning beauty in their faces, and joy in their hearts.
❖

His statement: 4 Looking at their Lord$, with the letter
A z-Z a, derived from An-Nazar (to look). Here, it is
transitive with the use of the preposition yat$ (lid)
which indicates an objective. It is a kind of looking
with the faces. The looking that is done with the
faces, is with eyes; unlike the looking which is done
with the hearts, for this is done with Al-Basirah
(insight), At-Taddabur (pondering), and At-Taffakur
(reflection). In this case, the looking is done with the
faces, towards the Lord, the Mighty and Sublime,
based on His statement: 4 At their L ord.4

So the noble Ayah indicates that these beautiful and
handsome faces shall be looking at their Lord, the Mighty
and Sublime, then, their beauty and handsomeness will
increase.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

603

Look at how these faces were made to be ready to look at
the Face of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, because they
have a light of beauty and were readily prepared to look at
the Face of Allah.
Thus, there is a proof in this Ayah that Allah, the Mighty
and Sublime, will be seen with vision.
This is the saying of the People of the Sunnah and the
Jama ah. They used the Ayat quoted by the author as proof,
and the Mutawatir Hadiths from the Prophet £§;, and those
reported by many Companions from him. Many of the
Tdbi'in also reported this from the Companions, and many
of followers of the Tdbi'in[1] reported this from the Tdbi'in,
etc.
The texts concerning that are absolute, in affirmation and
evidence; because they are from the Book of Allah, Exalted
is He, and in Mutawatir Sunnah of His Messenger
And they have composed a poem concerning this, saying:
Among the reported with Tawaatur is the Hadith
O f whoever knowingly speaks lies (against me)
And whoever builds a house fo r Allah and anticipates
rew ard.
And looking, intercession and Al-Hawd
And (concerning) wiping over the Khuff.
These are some of them.
What is intended by his saying "looking” is the looking of
the believers at their Lord.

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

The People of the Sunnah and the Jama'ah say that the
looking referred to here is the looking with the vision of the
eyes, in reality.
This does not imply grasping; for Allah, Exalted is He, says:

4No vision can grasp Him}- (Al-An'am 6: 103)
Just as the knowledge of the heart, it also does not imply
that it can grasp Him. Allah, Exalted is He, says:

4And they will never encompass Him, in knowledge4
(Td Ha 20:110)
And we know our Lord with our hearts, but we cannot
grasp His "how " and His reality. And on the Day of
Resurrection, we shall see our Lord with our vision; yet our
vision cannot grasp Him.

}L ookin g}: What is being looked at is not mentioned;
it therefore includes everything that they will be glad
to be looking at.

The greatest and the most delightful looking is looking at
Allah, Exalted is He, according to His, Exalted is He,
statement:

4 You will recognize in their faces the brightness o f
delight4 (A l-M u tafffn 83:24)
The context of the Ayah resembles His statement:

iS om e faces that Day shall be Nadirah (shining and
radiant). Looking at their L ord} (Al-Qiydmah 75:22-23)
They shall be looking at whatever they enjoy looking at it.
Among such is looking at evil companions being punished
in the Fire as He, Exalted is He, says:

4 A speaker o f them will s a y : "Verily, I had a
companion (in the world), who used to say : 'Are you
among those who believe (in resurrection after death).
(That) when we die and become dust and bones, shall
we indeed (be raised up) to receive reward or punish­
ment (according to our deeds)?'" (The man) said } (AsSdffdt 37:51-54)
That is to his companions:

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

i" W ill you look dow n?"} (As-Saffat 37:54)
This is intended to express suspense... Look down at what?
At this companion:

4So he looked down and saw him in the midst o f the
Fire} (.As-Saffat 37:55)
I seek refuge from Allah — he saw him in its midst, that is its base and bottom...Subhdn Allahl This one at the heights
of the 'Illiyyin while this one is in the lowest of the low, yet
he is looking at him in spite of the great distance!
However, the manner of looking of the people of Paradise
is unlike the manner of looking of the people of the world.
There, a person will look at his dominion, which is a
journey of two hundred years; he shall be looking at the
farthest place just as he is looking at the nearest place, due
to the perfection of his favors. If a person were to look as he
looks in the world, he would not enjoy the bounties of
Paradise. This is because (in the world) his gaze only
reaches what is near, so many things are hidden from him.
So this one looked down from the heights of the 'Illiyyin to
the lowest of the low, and saw him in the midst of the Fire.
He said, addressing him:

4 By Allah! You have nearly ruined m e} (As-Saffat
37:56)
This shows that he was persistently trying to mislead him
into error. That is why he said: 4You have n early.}
Meaning you came close, and:

iH a d it not been fo r the Grace o f my Lord, I would
certainly have been among those brought forth (to Hell).
"Are we then not to die?"$ (As-Saffat 37:57-58)
Until the end of the Ayat.
I say, people used to argue (in amazement) concerning this,
saying: "H ow can he be in the highest place, and address
one he is looking at, and speak with him, while he is in the
lowest place?”
But now, with the inventions of man, such as satellite,
telephones, television and the like - a person can see
someone inside of it, and speak to him, and look at him,
though he is far away. Yet, we are not able to compare
what happens in the Hereafter with what happens in the
world.
* Therefore, 4 Looking^ is general. They shall be looking at
Allah, looking at the their favors and at the punishment
being meted out to the inhabitants of the Fire.
If someone says: "There is a problem here. Why would they
be looking at the inhabitants of the Fire, while making jest
of them and censuring them?”
We answer - by Allah - how many times have the people of
the Fire made the people of Paradise taste punishments,
trials and harassment in the world?! He, Exalted is He,
says:

4 Verily! (During the worldly life) those who committed
crimes used to laugh at those who believed^ (AlMutaffifin 83:29)
They laugh whether at their gatherings or while with the
believers:

i^And whenever they passed by them, used to wink one
to another (in mockery). And when they returned to
their own people, they would return j e s t i n g ( A l Mutaffifin 83:30-31)
Meaning, they would return (to their people) enjoying
what they said:

4And when they saw them, they said: "Verily! These
have indeed gone astray!")* (Al-Mutaffifin 83:32)
Allah, Exalted is He, says:

iB u t this Day, those who believe will laugh at the
disbelievers. On Qrigh) thrones, l o o k i n g (Al-Mutaffifin
83:34-35)
They shall be looking at them, while they (the disbelievers)
— refuge is with Allah — shall be in the midst of the
Blazing Fire.
Thus, this is from the completeness of justice from Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime, by making these people - who
were annoyed in the abode of the world - rejoice over the
favors Allah gave them, and censuring these people who
will be in the midst of the Blazing Fire.

❖

ia n d even more)* (Wa Ziyadah) refers to gazing at the
Face of Allah.

explained it, as affirmed in

In this Ayah there is evidence of seeing Allah, based on the
explanation of the Messenger
who without a doubt, is
the most knowledgeable of all people concerning the
meanings of the Qur'an. He has explained it as looking at
the Face of Allah, which is an addition to the favors of the
Paradise.
So, it is a favor, but not the kind of the favors in Paradise;
because the kinds of favors in Paradise have to do with
bodies, such as rivers, fruits, other produce, and pure
wives, and the joys of the hearts that come with that. But
gazing at the Face of Allah is the comfort of the heart. The
inhabitants of Paradise will not see any bounty better than
that. We beseech Allah to make us among those that will

see Him.
And there will never be another favor equal to this; not the
fruits, the rivers, nor other than that, ever. That is why He
said: $and even morefy (Wa Ziyddah), that is — in addition
to Al-Husna (Paradise).

And His statement: $There they will have all that they
desire, and We have more$ (Q af 50: 35)
❖ ❖ ❖
The fourth Ayah:

iT h ere they will have all that they desire, and We have
more$ (Q af 50: 35)
❖

iT here they will have all that they desire$ Meaning that
is in Paradise — all that they desire.

It has been related in an authentic Hadith that a man said to
the Prophet
"O the Messenger of Allah, are there horses
in Paradise? For I love horses." He ^ said in reply: "If
Allah admits you into Paradise, you will never desire to
ride a horse of red ruby, with which you would be flown
around whichever part of Paradise you want, except that
you will have it." The Bedouin Arab said: "Are there
camels in Paradise? For I love camels?" He replied: "O
Bedouin! If Allah admits you into Paradise, in it, you will
get whatever your self desires, and whatever your eyes

611

could delight in ."^
So whenever something is desired, then it shall be, such
that some scholars say that even if one desires a child, he
will have a child. Whatever they desire, it will be theirs.
He, Exalted be He, says:

} Therein, all that the one's souls could desire, all that
the eyes could delight in, and you will abide therein
fo rev er.} (Az-Zukhruf 43:71)
❖

And His statement: }A n d we have more } , that is in
addition to what they desire.

Meaning if someone desires something, he is given that,
and he is given something in addition, as in the authentic
Hadith about the last person to enter Paradise, wherein it is
said that Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, would continue to
give him favor after favor, and he would say: "I am
pleased" and He would say to him: "That is for you, and
tenfold its like."[2] That is, more than what he desires.
Many of the scholars interpreted the "extra" a the Prophet
had explained the "addition," that is, gazing at the
Glorious Face of Allah.
So there are four Ayat that the author mentioned indicating

Buraidah Al-Aslaml, may Allah be pleased with him.

Reported by Muslim (188) from Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri, may

612

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

that Allah, Exalted be He, shall be seen.
There is also a fifth Ayah with which Imam Ash-Shafi'I, may
Allah have mercy upon him, used as evidence, and that is
His, Exalted be He, statement concerning the wicked:

4 Nay! Surely, they will be veiled from seeing their Lord
that Day4 (Al-Mutaffifin 83:15)
The evidence here is that what is veiled from those due to
wrath, is seen by those others due to the pleasure. Thus, if
the one who earned the wrath are veiled from seeing Allah,
then the people who earned the pleasure are to see Allah,
the Mighty and Sublime.
This is a very strong proof, because if everybody all
together will be veiled (from seeing Allah), then there is no
point in specifically mentioning these people.
Therefore, we say: The Ayat are five. And it is possible that we
include with them, the statement of Allah, Exalted be He:

4No vision can grasp Him, but His Grasp is over all
vision4 (Al-An'dm 6:103)
According to what we will mention in refuting those who
negate it, if Allah wills.
Hence, this is the position of the People of the Sunnah
concerning seeing Allah, Exalted be He, and their evidence.
It is unambiguously clear; none will reject it except
ignorant or stubborn person.
They were opposed in this by groups of the people of Ta'til,
among the Jahmiyyah, the Mu'tazilah, the Ash'ariyyah and
others, and they tried to prove their view with revealed

texts that are not as clear, and intellectual claims

4 And when Musa came at the time and place appointed
by Us, and his Lord spoke to him, he said: "O my
Lord! Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon You."
Allah said: "You cannot see M e, but look upon the
mountain, if it stands still in its place, then you shall
see M e." So when his Lord appeared to the mountain,
He made it collapse to dust, and Musa fell down
unconscious.$ (Al-A'raf 7:143)
The evidence (according to them) in this Ayah, is that the
word Lan (not, never) implies permanent negation, and the
negation is a form of information, and the information
provided by Allah, Exalted be He, is the truth that cannot
be abrogated.
The Refutation Against them is from number perspectives:
Firstly: It is not correct that the word Lan is used to express
permanent negation; it is a mere claim that is not supported
by an evidence. Ibn Malik said in "Al-Kafiyyah":
"W hoever considers Lan to express permanent negation
His opinion should be rejected while other than it should
be clung to.”
Secondly: Musa, may the Salah and Salam be upon him, did
not request to see Allah in the Hereafter; he only requested
to see Him then, according to His statement: 4 Show me

614

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

(Yourself), that I may look upon You } , that is now. Allah,
Exalted be He, then said to him (in reply): }Y ou cannot
see M e} meaning: "You cannot see me now.” Then, Allah
struck a similitude for him, with the mountain, while
Allah made it collapse into dust when He appeared to
the mountain. He said: }B u t look upon the mountain, if it
stands still in its place then you shall see M e .}
When Musa saw what happened to the mountain, he knew
for sure that he could not see Allah, and fell down
unconscious due to terrible fear from what he witnessed.
We are saying that to see Allah, Exalted be He, in this life is
impossible because the state of the human is such that it can
not withstand seeing Allah, the Mighty and Sublime. How
would that be, while the Prophet
had said about his Lord:
"H is veil is the Light, if He uncovers it, the Sublimity of His
Face will incinerate as far as His Sight reaches in His
creation.” 111
But as for seeing Allah in the Hereafter, that is possible
because at that time, people will be in another world,
where their state is different than their state in the world; as
is known from the texts of the Book and the Sunnah about
what will happen to people on the Day of Resurrection,
and their stay in the abode of delight, or the Blazing Fire.
The third perspective: The impossibility of seeing Allah in
the Hereafter — to those who deny it — is based upon their
view that its affirmation will indicates an imperfection with
respect to Allah, Exalted be He, as they have justified their
negation with that. Based on this, the request of Musa to his
Lord to let him see Him, was either because Musa was
ignorant of what is required with regard to Allah, and
impossible regarding His case, or it was an act of
Its reference preceded.

Commentary On The Introductory N otes.

615

transgression by requesting from Allah what does not befit
Him, if he knew that it was not possible in the case of
Allah. Accordingly, these rejecters would be more knowl­
edgeable of what is required regarding Allah, Exalted is
He, and of what is impossible in His case, than Musa!! And
this is the utmost misguidance!!
From this view, it is clear that in the Ayah, there is evidence
against them, not evidence for them.
And in the same way, every evidence in the Book and the
authentic Sunnah with which someone tries to prove
falsehood, or negate the truth, then it will be an evidence
against him, not an evidence for him.
The second evidence of those who negate seeing Allah,
Exalted be He, is His statement:

4No vision can grasp Him, but His Grasp is over all
vision. He is the Most Subtle and Courteous, Wellwith
all things^ (Al-An'dm 6:103)
In refutation against them, we say the Ayah contains the
negation of grasping; and seeing does not necessarily
indicate grasping. Can't you see that one can see the sun,
and yet he is not encompassing it by grasping it? So, if we
affirm that Allah, Exalted be He, will be seen, it does not
mean that He will be grasped by this seeing, because to
grasp (with vision) is more specific that mere seeing.
That is why we say that the negation of grasping is
evidence for the existence of seeing, because the negation of
the specific proves the existence of the general. If the
general had also been negated, its negation would be
necessary, and it would have been said: "N o vision will see
Him” because such negation indicates the negation of the

616

Commentary on Al-'Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah

specific, not its opposite. And because if the general was
being negated, then, negating the specific would be the
kind of falsehood and deception that the Word of Allah,
Exalted be He, is free from.
Based on this, in the Ayah, there is an evidence against
them, not an evidence for them.
As for the Intellectual Evidences Used by the Rejecters for
the seeing:
They said: If Allah is to be seen, that necessitates that he is
physical, and being physical is not possible for Allah,
Exalted be He, because that would necessitate likening and
comparing.
The refutation against them is that if by seeing Allah, Exalted
is He, it was necessary that He be physical, then it would be
such, but we know with certain knowledge, that He does not
resemble the bodies of creatures, because Allah says:

iT h ere is nothing like unto Him, and He is the Hearer,
the Seer$ (Ash-Shura 42: 11)
Even though the saying that being physical is to be negated
or affirmed, is among the innovations of the people of
Kalam. Neither its affirmation nor its negation is found in
the Book or the Sunnah.
The rejecters have responded to the proofs of the affirmers
(in this matter) with bland responses. They clearly altered
the proofs, so much that it is not hidden to anybody. This is
not the place to mention them (their responses); they are
mentioned in more voluminous books.
The Behavioral Benefits We derive from these A y a t:
As for the issue of seeing (Allah), what would have a

617

greater impact have on the behavioral perspective, because
if someone knows that the best of all rewards is to gaze at
the Face of Allah, the entire world would be less significant
to him. Everything will be sacrificed by him in order to see
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, because that is the goal of
every seeker and the utmost of desires.
If you know that you are going to see your Lord clearly
with the vision of you eyes, by Allah, the world will not be
worth anything to you. So all of the world is nothing,
because gazing at the Face of Allah is the fruit that the
competitors in good deeds are competing for, and that
those who hasten, hasten for, and it is the utmost of the
desire in everything.
So when you know this, would you hasten to that result or
not?
The answer will be yes, I will definitely hasten towards
that, without any hesitation.
In reality, to reject that seeing, is a great deprivation, but
faith in it will give the person tremendous drive to end up
at this goal, so it will be easy, and all praise is due to Allah.
The whole of the religion is easy, even if you feel some
discomfort, the religion becomes easy. Thus, its basis is
easy. If discomfort is found, it becomes easy a second time.
If he is not able to execute the obligation, then that is
removed for him. There is nothing that is obligatory in the
state of incapability, and nothing that is unlawful in the
state of necessity.

The author
said: "And, this topic is related in many
places in the Book o f A llah; whoever ponders the Qur'an,
seeking guidance, the path o f the truth will become evident
for him ."

❖

Concerning his statement: "This topic": Indicating the
topic of the Names and Attributes.

❖

Concerning his statement: "Is related in many places in the
Book o f Allah" that is why there is no Ayah in the Book of
Allah except that you find therein - in most cases - a Name
among the Names of Allah, or an action of His actions, or a
judgment of His judgments. Rather, if you like, then say:
"Every Ayah in the Book of Allah is an Attribute among
the Attributes of Allah;" because the Glorious Qur'an is
the Word of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and every
Ayah therein is an Attribute among the Attributes of
Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.

❖

C oncerning his statem ent: "W hoever ponders the
Qur'an": Tadabbur regarding a thing, means reflecting
upon it, such as when turns away from it one time, and
turns back to it another, so he repeats the expressions to
understand its meaning. The one who ponders the
Qur'an, does so in this manner.

As for the intention, it is that it be done "seeking guidance."
So his objective behind pondering the Qur'an is not to find

support for his view, to gather an argument for falsehood;
but his objective is to seek the truth, for the result will be as
said by the author: "The path o f the truth will become evident
fo r h im ." What a marvelous result!
But that is preceded by two matters: Pondering, and a good
intention; so the person is seeking the guidance of the
Qur'an; then, the path of the truth becomes evident for him.
The evidence for this is taken from many Ayat. Among
them are, His statement, the Blessed and Exalted be He:

} And We have also sent down unto you the reminder
and the advice, that you may explain clearly to men
what is sent down to them } (An-Nahl 16: 44)
Also, He, Exalted be He, says:

}(T his is) a Book which We have sent down to you, full
o f blessings that they may ponder over its Ayat, and
that men o f understanding may remember} (Sad 38:29)
Also, He, Exalted be He, says:

}H ave they not pondered over the W ord, or has there
come to them what had not come to their fathers o f
old?} (Al-Mu'minun 23:68)
And He, Exalted be He, says:

}A n d indeed, We have made the Qur'an easy to
understand and remember, then is there any that will

remember?} (Al-Qamar 54:32)
The Ayat concerning this are many, indicating that
whoever ponders over the Qur'an — but with this intention
of seeking guidance from it — he will definitely achieve the
result, and that is the clarity of the path of the truth.
But as for him who ponders the Qur'an to try to confuse
one part of it against another, to have a basis for arguing
falsehood, and to support his views, as is found among the
people of innovation and the people of deviation, such will
be blinded from the truth. And refuge is sought from Allah.
This is because Allah, Exalted be He, says:

f i t is He Who has sent down to you the Book. In it are
Ayat that are entirely clear, they are the foundations o f
the Book; and others not entirely clear. So as fo r those
in whose hearts there is a deviation they follow that
which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking Al-Fitnah,
and seeking fo r its hidden meanings, but none knows its
hidden meanings save Allah and those who are firmly
grounded in knowledge} (Al 'Imran 3:7)
Meaning as for those who are firmly grounded in knowl­
edge:

If they say this, they will be guided to the adequate
explanation of these Ayat that are not entirely clear. Then,
