Publishers Note

We are presenting before you the second volume of the book History of
Islam. This book was originally written in the Urdu language in 1922
(1343 AH) by Akbar Shah Khan Najeebabadi. This was the time about
25 years before the partition of Indian Subcontinent into Pakistan and
India. For the purpose of brevity, the compiler has presented the
authentic events in concise form from the famous histories of Islam
written in the Arabic and Persian languages by the great Muslim
historians like Tabari, Ibn Athir, Mas'udi, Abul-Fida', Ibn Khaldun
and Suyuti, apart from getting benefited from the authentic books of
Ahadith for the compilation of the part about the biography of the
Prophet Muhammad ~- So, this compilation is actually the extract of
the works of the famous Muslim historians.
First volume of this book was heartily greeted by the readers. Now we
are proud to present the second volume. In the first volume, starting
with the introduction of the history as a subject, the country, people
and conditions of Arabia prior to the advent of Islam were discusse-l,
and an account of the life of Prophet Muhammad ~ was presentl d
including the hardships and opposition he faced while propagati1;g
the message of Islam, and the details of migration and the period aft, r
it until his death. After that the description of Rightly Guide,:l
Caliphate was also discussed in its full perspective.

The History of Islam

In this second volume, starting with the Caliphate of Banu Umayyah,
the martydom of Imam Husain�, and the Caliphate of the Abbasids,
all areas have been covered as far as the expansion of Islam was.
We hope that the readers will find this volume also of great help in the
study of Islamic history. The famous scholar Safi-ur-Rahman
Mubarakpuri has revised the Urdu edition before its translation to
check the authenticity aspect.
The translation was done by the Translation Department of
Darussalam, and every care has been taken to reproduce the events
and the names of the persons and places as accurately as possible. We
thank all the persons who have cooperated with us to complete this
task and produce it before you into a presentable form. May Allah
accept our humble efforts in this regard and send His peace and
blessings on our Prophet Muhammad, his Companions and his
followers. -Amin!

Chapter 1

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah
(First Phase)

After the Khilafat Rashida, (the rightly guided caliphate) we now
begin with the Caliphate of Banu Umayyah. In the Khilafat arRashida, the first two caliphs were neither from Banu Umayyah nor
from Banu Hashim. The period of these two rightly guided Caliphs
was the best. The third was related to the family of Banu Umayyah
and the fourth to Banu Hashim. In the second half of the Khilafat arRashida, the caliphs of both Banu Umayyah and Banu Hashim
remained on the throne. The second half compared to the first half
may be called a period of failure though it was certainly better than
the caliphates that followed because the Prophet's companions were
the rulers and most of his companions were still alive.
Islam came into the world to wipe out Shirk, (partnership with Allah)
and establish Tawhid, oneness of Allah. The Prophet (jj;) showed
mankind what is perfect Tawhid and the way to real success. There can
be no harm or loss greater than Shirk and no felicity and success
greater than Tawhid. Shirk, in fact, is the name of injustice and
oppression. That is why the noble Quran calls it the greatest of

20

The History of Islam

injustices. What can be a bigger injustice than the fact that man should
regard as his Maker, all the helpless beings that are themselves Allah's
creations and slaves? Only that person can commit Shirk who wants to
lead a life of injustice. The greatest thing that compels a man to
embrace injustice is ignorance coupled with unjustified love, which in
Quranic phraseology we call darkness and loss of the right path. In
unjustified and uncalled for love for elders of our families and tribes
we accord unjust veneration of their, pictures, statues and graves and
these are the chief reasons that lead to the prevalence of Shirk in the
world. It is through this that mankind has forgotten its Creator and
fell into a death-pit. The Prophet(~) wiped out all the possibilities of
Shirk, he also saved mankind from unjustified family prejudice and
love that takes mankind away from justice and impartiality. The
second thing that compels and has been compelling mankind to suffer
from this greatest injustice is unjustified pride. This is the very thing
that turned Iblis into Satan, the rejected one and it is through this that
he has been able to seduce most people from the right path and put
them on the way to destruction. When this unjustified pride joins
hands with unjustified love, a very powerful formula for destruction
is prepared for mankind. In order to do away with this source of Shirk
the Prophet (~) on the day of the conquest of Makkah, stood at the
door of the Ka'bah and addressed the inhabitants of Makkah and
those who were influential among the Arabs.
"O the tribe of Quraish! Allah did away with your vanity of the
age of ignorance and your pride in your ancestors. All men are
the offspring of Adam and Adam was made of clay. Allah says,
0 mankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and a
female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know
each other. Verily the most honored of you in the sight of Allah
is (he who is) the most righteous of you." (Ibn Hisham 4:60)
Putting an end to racial and tribal pride was in reality closing the
avenues to Shirk and creating the capacity for Tawhid. Also, there is no
denying the existence of tribes and nations and their distinctions but
greatness is not connected with race and family. Greatness and
superiority is connected with the recognition and fear of Allah.
Everybody who becomes pious deserves to be blessed and every

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

21

member of a tribe earns debasement for his and her misdeeds. By
setting people on the right and straight path, the Prophet (~ )
delivered them to success in both the worlds and felicity for mankind .
In the first half of the Khilafat ar-Rashida, the Muslims had nothing to
do with the renounced sources of deviation and forgot family
intolerance Quraish used to address Bilal the Habashi (Ethiopian) as
'Sayyadi' (my chief) and regarded him as more honored than
themselves by virtue of his good deeds. The wisdom in sending the
Muhajirfn and Ansars of noble families under the command of Osama
bin Zaid (= 11...,:,)) was that nobody should harbor the thought in his
heart that a man could be honored by virtue of nation, race or family .
Had the crown and caliphate been the prerogative of a particular tribe
and family, the Prophet (~ ) would not have sent anybody other than
Banu Hashim as administrators to the provinces and territories and as
commanders of the armed forces but he rarely did so. He always took
care to bestow leadership and governorship strictly on the basis of
merit. He did not consider anyone worthy of such a position based on
one's relation to a particular family, or tribe. That was why even
slaves could become leaders over the elders in Quraish and be given
command the aremed forces nothing there than his would have been
expected of the perfect teacher who preached pure Tawhid.
There had been a historical rivalry between Banu Umayyah and Banu
Hashim as both tried to excel each other. That was probably why
Banu Urnayyah first opposed the Prophet (~ ), who belonged to the
tribe of Banu Hashim, vehemently and Banu Hashim supported him
more. When the Polythiests, those who make partners with Allah,
were totally wiped out from the Arab and the opposing atheists of
both tribes were slain or the fortunate ones embraced Islam, there
were a good number of courageous and meritorious people in the
newly converted Banu Urnayyah. The Prophet (~ ) honored their
capabilities. At the time of the conquest of Makkah by equating Abu
Sufyan's house with the Ka'bah in connection to protection, he pleased
them. Uthrnan bin Affan ("--"' .'iii ,.;-PJ) who came from Banu Urnayyah
and who was the Prophet's son-in-law, Ba'it ar-Ridwan was taken for
him. Urn ul-Muminin Um Habiba (-= .'iii ,.;-PJ) also belonged to the Banu
Umayyah tribe, she was Abu Sufyan's daughter and Muawiya's sister.
The Prophet (~ ) appointed Abu Sufyan (= .'iii ,.;-PJ) the ruler of Najran.

22

The History of Islam

He made Uthman bin Abul-Aas ("--"-11 _,-----"J) who was Uthman bin
Affan's uncle, the governor of Taif and the adjoining areas. Umar
Farooq ('-----"' .;;,, -F" J) made him governor of Oman and Bahrain. At tab
bin Usaid (= .'iii ,.,-"J), the grandson of Abu Sufyan's uncle Abul-Aas,
who became a Muslim on the day of the victory of Makkah was
appointed the ruler of Makkah. Khalid bin Sayeed, the grandson of
Abu Sufyan's uncle, was made the administrator of Yemen. He
became a martyr in the battle of Yarmuk. Similarly, the Prophet(*')
appointed Uthman bin Sayeed the governor of Khaibar and and his
brother Aban the ruler of Bahrain. Had the Prophet (~) an iota of the
old rivalry between Banu Umayyah and Banu Hashim and preferred
the racial and family relations to personal qualification, he would
not have made these people of Banu Umayyah the administrators of
these provinces.
He never chose racial discrimination to individual excellence. Yes, he
admitted to tribal preferences but it was confined only to those
families, which were known for their managing and leading
capabilities due to the experience and training that the members of
those specific tribes were exposed to. For management and
commander ship, he selected the capable and qualified persons from
among these families. Islam had put an end to the traditional rivalry
that existed between Banu Umayyah and Banu Hashim. Therefore, it
was appropriate that they should not have been put in the position to
partake in the Caliphate for some time so that they would not be able
to revive their old competitive rivalry. The Prophet ~ realized this
danger fully, which was indicated by his making Abu Bakr=- 11 -?J
the Imam of the Sa/at so that he would be made the caliph after the
Prophet's death. The group of Sahabas (Companions of the Prophet ~ )
who had discernment and understanding, acted upon it whole
heartedly. Similarly, Abu Bakr ~ .;;,, ,? J appointed as his successor
after him the man who was superior to all others in merit and
belonged to neither bothe tribes. In the same way if after Umar bin
Khattab ~ .'iii ~ J Abu Obeida bin Al-Jarrah-..,. 11 <.r'J or Salim Maula
Hudhaifa = 11<.r'J had been made the caliph as Umar bin Khattab <.r'J
~ 11 himself wanted, then this dormant rivalry would not have come
to life again. But these two noblemen had died much earlier than
Umar bin Khattab "--"- .;;,, ~ J - Again, if any of the six members of the

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

23

Shura (council) chosen by Umar bin Khattab ~ 11~ ; to pick his
successor had maintained this principle by selecting one from among
themselves that did not belong to either both tribes to be made caliph,
it would have been possible that the future dangers might have been
averted and at least both these tribes would not have recalled their
forgotten rivalry. If Ali bin Abi Talib '---"" 11._?; had been made the
caliph after Umar bin Khattab = 11._?; there was every possibility that
this extinguished fire would not have reignited. This is because Ali bin
Abi Talib ~ 11 ~ ; was not expected to have made so much
extraordinary and sensitive allowances for Banu Hashim as Uthman
bin Affan <......c.<-11~
; made in favor of Banu Umayyah. However, we
should have faith that whatever happened was strictly in accordance
with the dictates of Allah and was the destiny that He decreed. We
have nothing at our disposal to prefer our presumed resolution that
did not actually occur to the results of events that really took place.
The most that we can say is that the rebirth and prolongation of the
systematic rivalry between Banu Hashim and Banu Umayyah during
the Islamic era was extremely harmful for Islam. Those today who
want to see this rivalry maintained and consider the connection with a
particular family or tribe as a necessary qualification for the post of
caliph are increasingly proving themselves as enemies of and harmful
to Islam.
Banu Umayyah by virtue of their personal merit, were regarded as an
integral part of the Islamic caliphate. After the appointment of
Uthman bin Affan <. . . c.<- 11~ ; as the caliph, Banu Umayyah took
advantage of his mild nature and Marwan bin Al-Hakam's remaining
in authority, increased their power and influence so much that they
overwhelmed the entire Islamic World and were occupied with
maneuvering to establish their leadership over the Arab world which
they previously could not have done in view of the stiff opposition
they faced during the days of Ignorance. The martyrdom of Uthman
bin Affan = 11 ._?; and the conspiracy hatched by the Munafiqin and the
Jews posing as Muslims helped them establish their control even more.
Ali bin Abi Talib = 11-?; had to face greater difficulties during his rule
for the simple reason that he was from Banu Hashim. The rivalry
between Banu Hashim and Banu Umayyah was constantly before the
eyes of the whole Arab world. They attributed all attempts made by Ali

24

The History of Islam

bin Abi Talib = 11 ..,f-J against Muawiya= 11 ..,f-J and Banu Umayyah to
these rivalries and did not cooperate with him because they did not
like to participate in reviving the old rivalries between these two
tribes. Had there been a non-Hashmite as caliph instead of Ali bin Abi
Talib <.......:,,. 11 ~
J , he would have gotten more help from the Arab tribes.
Had Ali bin Abi Talib -= 11 ..,f-J himself not been the caliph he would
have done better in opposing Muawiya = 11 ..,f-J and crushing Banu
Umayyah and would have found himself more powerful and effective
in establishing the caliphate of one who was not a Hashimite.
At this moment, we recollect involuntarily the last words of Imam
Hasan
11 .,?J, which he uttered as a last testament to Imam Husain
= 11 .,?J at the time of his death.
-.__.c.,,

"When Ali bin Abi Talib= 11 ..,f-J became caliph after the Prophet's *
death, swords came out of their sheaths and this issue remained
unsettled and now I know it full well that Prophethood and the
caliphate cannot co-exist in our family."
The future, which has now passed into the past, has put its seal of
truth on these true words of Imam Hasan= 11 ..?)· After the rightly
guided Caliphs, Banu Umayyah made Damascus its capital and ruled
over the whole Islamic world for about ninety years. For several
hundred years, their caliphate and rule continued in Spain. The rule
by Banu Abbas family in Baghdad lasted for more than five hundred
years. Banu Abbas are Banu Hashim, no doubt, but they are the
descendants of the prophet's uncle and not the descendants of the
Prophet's daughter. In other words, Sadat (Arabic plural of the word
Sayed which is a title of respect and is also used to refer to the
Prophet's descendants) can by taken as belonging to the Prophet's
family because the Prophet's blood through Fatima bint Muhammad
~ is present. As there is no mixing of the Prophet's blood in the
Abbasids, they cannot be taken as belonging to his descendants. A
ruling family in Egypt c,laimed to be called Fatimid, but research
scholars found its claim to be false. In India, there was a family that
called themselves Sadat. But it is an open secret that Khidr Khan, the
ruler of Multan, who was its first ancestor, was by no means a Sayed .
The cause of his being known as a Sayed was simply because a mystic
saint addressed him as Sayed, which is also a title of respect. Even

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

25

today, people address the Mughal and Pathan (tribe in Mangols)
chiefs as "Sayed." In short, no one has been able to found a free
government and kingship of Sadat of significance in any country so
far. This is the one reality before us. When we recall the last words of
Imam Hasan ~ .iii c?j our hearts are unconsciously overawed by the
grand truth and magnificent utterance of the speaker.
Whatever Imam Hasan= .iii c?j told his brother Imam Husain = .;;;1 c?J
at the time of his death, was not only his Ijtihad (the pronouncement
of the learned when Qur'an, Hadith, and Sunnah have not clarified an
issue) or ilham (inspiration) but also that of the entire group of the
Prophet's Companions. This was the idea that led the Prophet ~ to
make a Hashmi neither a permanent ruler of a province nor a free and
responsible commander of a large army. Though in the expedition of
Mauta the Proper deputed Jafar bin Abi Talib= 11 c?J as a commander,
he made his freed slave Zaid bin Harith his senior. Although, he
assigned Ali bin Abi Talib = .; ;, c? j the work of collecting the Islamic
tax in Yemen and that was only for a short time and he gave the post
of administrator to Muadh bin Jab! = 11 c? J and Abu Musa Al-Ashari
'-'->- 11~)· Similarly Abu Bakr-= 11c?J and Umar bin Khattab ""'11 c?J
never deputed Banu Hashim on important and responsible posts nor
made them rulers of states though these two first caliphs paid great
respect to Banu Hashim took care for their likes and dislikes, took
Masfzwara (consul) from them and acted upon it. Umar bin Khattab
once said that if they had the power of a ruler along with the honor of
Prophethood, they would cause the people to be very submissive and
this would make them suffer from tribal pride and thereby kill the real
spirit of Islam and they would destroy themselves.
Once he said that whoever led people towards the veneration of the age
of Ignorance, he must be slain. Once again he said "If anybody made a
man Amir or ruler on the basis of his relation or friendship with him
though better persons among the Muslims were available he committed
a breach of trust with Allah, the Prophet~ and the Muslim community.
In brief, this was not only the faith of Imam Hasan =.;;;, ~ J that the
honor of Prophethood is sufficient for the family of the Prophet ~ and
the honor of the rule should not be linked to it, but this belief was also
shared by most of the Sahabas. The truth is.that the holy Sadat who

26

The History of Islam

were related to the Prophet's family and who were supposed to end
shirk and all its facets from the world, should not hanker after worldly
dominion and material prosperity so that they might prove worthy of
being the Prophet's progeny. If the Prophet ~ had not declared taking
Sadaga (charity) unlawful for the Sadat, we could have expected that
they, the family of the Prophet ~ deserved to be caliphs and emperors.
But this provision for his family is the biggest proof that he had already
decided that his family would remain non-attached to worldly riches or
perhaps he might have known it from the divine revelation. The
forbidding of charity to the family of the Prophet~ is in fact a matter of
great pride for the Sadat and it exalts their status to such heights that the
other groups of the world, which are related to Islam, can be envious of.
Worldly riches and sovereignty are such things which distance man
from Allah. The Holy Qur'an and Traditions, therefore look down upon
them. History tells us that the people despite being in possession of right
knowledge could not be persuaded to do good deeds. Only those lucky
people who had not much to do with material riches have been honored
to protect Islam and such people alone continue to safeguard Islam.
The Prophet ~ said, that Islam began with the poor and would last
with them. Also, think over this Tradition in which he(~ ) has said: "I
leave the Qur' an and my children, Sadat among you."
This Tradition also bears an ample proof of the fact that Imam Hasan
~.'iii~) had declared strictly in accordance with the intention of the
tradition, "I know it full well that Prophethood and the caliphate
cannot co-exist in our family."

Amir Muawiya

4-&,

.:»1 ~)

Amir Muawiya= .'iii ._?J was born seventeen years before the Hijra, he
was junior to Ali bin Abi Talib= .'iii ,.?J by six years. Amir Muawiya's
mother Hind bint Utba was first married to Faka bin Mughira
Quraishi. Faka once doubted his wife's chastity. He kicked her and
ultimately turned her out of his house. That became a topic of
discussion among the people. Hind' s father Utba asked his daughter.
"What is the matter? Tell me clearly. If Faka is justified in accusing
you, I shall tell somebody and he will kill him and we shall be saved
from dishonor. However, if he is a liar and slandered you unnecessarily,

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

27

we shall refer this affair to a soothsayer." Hind swore many times to
prove her innocence and refused the allegation absolutely . When Utba
was convinced of his daughter's innocence, he compelled Faka bin
Mughira to take his tribe Banu Makhzoom with him and go to a
soothsayer in Yemen. Similarly Utba bin Rabia too, along with a few
persons of Abd al-Manaf, Hind and a friend of hers, set out. They
reached the soothsayer and requested him to attend to the affair of
those two women.
The soothsayer first went to Hind's friend and striking at her both
shoulders said: "Stand up". Then he came to Hind and struck her also,
and said "Stand up. You have neither done a bad deed nor committed
adultery and you will give birth to a king whose name will be
Muawiya." Hearing this Faka caught hold of his wife's hand but the
latter pulled away her hand away with a jerk and told him that if she
was to give birth to a king, he would not be from his seed. So, after the
proof of her impeccability she severed her relation with him. Abu
Sufyan bin Harb then married Hind and Muawiya was born.
Abu Sufyan was not more than forty when Muawiya was born. Abu
Sufyan was ten years older than the Prophet ~- Right from his
childhood Amir Muawiya-= 1, ~ J had some indications of the future
by virtue of which he was called the 'Charo (Kisra) of the Arabs'. He
was chiefly known for his wisdom, good management, love of peace
and moderation. He was tall, fair complexioned, handsome and
strongly built. When the Prophet :;t saw him, he said, "This is the
Charo (Kisra) of Arabia. The day Muawiya-= 11 ~ J leaves the world,
you will see that lots of heads will be severed from their bodies." In
the last days of his life, Amir Muawiya's belly bulged a little. He used
to read the Khutba while sitting on the pulpit. This mode of address of
sitting was started by him. He was a well-read man. On the day of the
Conquest of Makkah he came with his father, Abu Sufyan, and
embraced Islam at the age of twenty five and remained with the
Prophet ~ until the latter's death. He accompanied him on the
expedition of Hunain and the siege of Taif also. After that when the
Prophet ~ came to Makkah, performed Umara and proceeded to
Madinah, Amir Muawiya= ..'l,1 ._?J Came Madinah and was appointed
as one of the recorders of the revelation. Apart from recording the

28

The History of Islam

revelation, he on behalf of the Prophet j/j; used to entertain and make
arrangements for the board and lodging of foreign delegates. After the
Prophet's death when Abu Bakr=- 11 ,._,.;,1 sent Amir Muawiya's brother
Yazid bin Abu Sufyan -= 11 ,?1 to Syria with an army, he gave Amir
Muawiya '-'-" 11 ,._,.;,1 a division and put him in charge of supplying aid
to him. In the Syrian expedition, his performance was extremely
marvelous and a good indication of his abilities and he impressed all
by his acts of valor. Umar bin Khattab '-----'-'- 11 ~ ; made him the
permanent administrator of Jordan. When Sahabas like Abu Obeida
and Yazid bin Abu Sufyan died of the plague of Amwas, Umar bin
Khattab -= 11 ,._,.;,; appointed him the ruler of Damascus, the jurisdiction
of his brother. Jordan and other districts were included under his
government. When Umar bin Khattab-= 11 ,._,.;,; went to Bait al-Maqdis
(Jerusalem), Amir Muawiya-= 11 ,?1 accorded a reception for him and
acompanied him. Umar bin Khattab '-----'-'- 11 ~ 1 objected to Amir
Muawiya =- 11 ,._,.;,; saying, "You have adopted the royal way of living
and I have heard, you have assigned door keepers." Amir Muawiya
~ 11 ~ 1 said, "The Syrian borders always remain in danger of
incursion by the Roman soldiers and attack. Their spies keep roaming
throughout Syria. I think the external pomp and grandeur is necessary
to keep the Roman emperor and the Christians in awe and the door
keepers keep the Roman spies at bay. 11
Satisfied with this answer Umar bin Khattab '-----'-'- 11 ~ ) no longer
questioned him. Amir Muawiya "--"' 11,._,.;,; sought his permission for
launching a naval attack on Constantinople and the capture of the
islands in the Mediterranean Sea. But Umar bin Khattab = 11 ,._,.;,; did
not allow him to do so. When Uthman bin Affan = 11 ,?; became
caliph after Umar bin Khattab = 11,._,.;,1 , he made Amir Muawiya 11,._,.;,;
-= the governor of Syria and all the adjoining areas. He permitted him
to prepare a navy and extended his powers. Amir Muawiya .w- 11 ,._,.;,1
captured Syria and considerably strengthened the Islamic rule there,
kept the Roman emperor in terror and awe of him and did not give
the Christians a chance to attack the Islamic territories. What
transpired between him and Ali bin Abi Talib '-----'-'- 11 ...,---:,,1 after the
martyrdom of Uthman bin Affan '-----'-'- 11 ~
;, has been discussed in

Hijra, the entire Islamic world took ba'it (Arabic for the swearing of
allegiance) at the hands of Amir Muawiya= .ii, <,P"J and Imam Hasan
accepted him as the caliph. Up to that time, Amir Muawiya= .'ii, ..r"J
had been the governor of Syria for twenty years. After becoming
caliph and emperor of the whole Islamic world, he remained alive for
twenty years more. The total period of his rule was forty years. In the
first half of the forty years, he was a ruler of a province or Governor
and in the second half, he ruled as caliph or emperor. I have recorded
in detail his conditions, circumstances and important events in the
first volume. From this point, we have to consider him as Caliph for
the events in the second half of his rule and hence he has been named
caliph in the following text.

Virtues and Habits
Amir Muawiya ~ .'ii, <,P"J has narrated 163 Ahadith (Traditions which

Important events during Amir Muawiya's Caliphate
When Amir Muawiya= 11..,..:,,J sat on the throne Caliphate there were
found three kinds of people in respect of faith and action in the
Islamic world. The first sect was of the partisans of Ali. They thought
that Ali bin Abi Talib= 11 ,?; deserved the Caliphate and after him,
his progeny was entitled to the Caliphate. This sect was found in Iraq
and Iran even more. It was also found Egypt. But it dwindled after the
renunciation of the throne by Imam Hasan -.......:.;. 11 ~ ; and his
reconciliation with Amir Muawiya= 11 ,?;- The second sect was of the
partisans of Muawiya or partisans of Banu Umayyah. It included the
whole of Syria and some Arabian tribes like Banu Kalb.
Due to the assassination of Uthman bin Affan = 11 ,?;, these people
believed that Amir Muawiya '--'>- 11 ~.; and Banu Umayyah were
entitled to the Caliphate and were ready to extend all help to them.
The third sect was called Khwarij. They considered the first two sects
to have gone astray and into unbelief and thus they used all their
powers against them. The hypocrites and conspirators who were
unanimously the enemies of Islam remained mingled with this people.
The majority of these Khwarij were in Iraq mostly in Basra and Kufa.
Besides these three sects, there was one more sect, which remained
'aloof from all these controversies and wanted to live a life of
withdrawal. This group consisted mostly of the great Sahabas. These
people were mostly found in Madinah Munawwara and Makkah
Mukarama and lived in the rural areas of the Hijaz or the pastures of
camels. After becoming caliph, Amir Muawiya = 11 ,?; first had to
face the Khwarij. When the truce was signed in the last ten days of
Rabia al-Awwal 41 Hegira and people in general took the oath at the

32

The History of Islam

hands of Amir Muawiya= .'iii cr"J· Farwa bin Naufil Ashjai, a Khwarij
along with 500 other Khwarij readied themselves to oppose him, left
Kufa and camped at a place named Nakhlia.
Amir Muawiya ~ .'i,1 ~ J instead of taking strong measures against
them acted with commonsense. He assembled the Kufis and exhorted
them. He said, "These are your own kith and kin. You yourselves
should make them understand and acquaint them with the horrible
consequences of opposition or fighting." The people of the Ashja tribe
were so impressed that they went and brought Farwa bin Naufil Ashja
as a captive. The Khwarij made Abdullah bin Abil Hausa their leader
and they did not show any inclination towards reconciliation. At last,
the Kufis fought with them and Abdullah was killed. After that, their
number was reduced to only 150. Then they chose Abu Hausa Asadi
as their leader. They were also appealed to for reconciliation, but they
preferred to die fighting and paid no heed to death. Finally, Abu
Hausa and his associates were killed while fighting and some of them
fled to different towns of Iraq and Iran. That was the first
confrontation that Amir Muawiya= .'i,1cr"J had in Kufa after becoming
caliph. Also, he became aware of different groups of Khwarij, which
were present in the towns all over Iraq.

Appointment of Officials
Amir Muawiya = .'iii cr"J had already given the governorship of Egypt
to Amr bin Al-Aas= .'iii cr"J· Now on becoming the caliph of the whole
Islamic world he appointed Sayeed bin Al-Aas and Marwan bin
Hakam L....-"' .'i,1 ~ J governors of Makkah and Madinah respectively.
Sayeed and Marwan 4--:..- .'iii cr"J both were his relatives. He deputed
them in Makkah and Madinah so that in these key cities of the Islamic
world, no opposition group might rise up and to eliminate the
possibility of any conspiracy . He did not go for Hajj every year he
would appoint one of them as the Amir of Hajj. He was also very alive
to the possibility that either of them could take advantage of the
centrality and importance of Makkah and Madinah to gain power and
influence. Because of this, he used to interchange their posts every
year. After taking the ba'it for his Caliphate in Kufa, Amir Muawiya
"---"" .'iii ~ J made Mughira bin Shoba = .'i,1 cr"J the governor of Kufa and

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

33

instructed him to crush the sedition of the Khwarij at any cost. He sent
a letter to the governors of the remaining provinces and territories to
take ba'it from the people on his behalf and consider themselves
assigned on his behalf. In Persia Ali bin Abi Talib 4....--"' .lil ,,,-:,,J had
deputed Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan ~ 11 c?J who was considered to be
from amongst partisans of Ali. Zeyad was known for his intelligence
all over Arabia and had been ruling over Persia very successfully.
Amir Muawiya= 11 c?J thought that if Zeyad betrayed him and made
anyone from the progeny of Ali= 11 ..r"J the caliph and took ba'it at his
hand and rebelled against him (Amir Muawiya ~ 11 c?J-), then it
would pose a major problem. Therefore, he gave the priority to a plan
to bring him under his control.

Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan ~ k, ~)
Zeyad' s mother Sumayya was the slave of Harith bin Kilab Thagafi.
People had doubts about who his real father was. In fact, Abu Sufyan
married Sumayya before embracing Islam and Zeyad was born of
them. Zeyad resembled Abu Sufyan but the members of Abu Sufyan' s
family and Amir Muawiya ~ 11 ~ J did not accept Zeyad as Abu
Sufyan's son. When Zeyad heard that Amir Muawiya= 11 c?J was
recognized as the caliph, he hesitated in taking ba'it, (the oath of
allegiance) and accepting Amir Muawiya .......,... 11 c?J as the caliph. At
that time, Amir Muawiya .__.,. 11 c?J thought it wise to give a latter of
protection to Zeyad' s friend Mughira bin Shoba and send him to
Zeyad and include him in his family and lineage by accepting him as
Abu Sufyan's son. Mughira took the letter to Zeyad in Persia attested
all the accounts of the treasury and brought him to Amir Muawiya c?J
~.'iii. Amir Muawiya= 11 c?J received him warmly and accepted him
as his brother. His name was officially written in all papers as ibn Abi
Sufyan. Ali bin Abi Talib ~ 11 ~ J was sure that Zeyad was Abi
Sufyan's son because Abi Sufyan once in his presence at a meeting
with Umar bin Khattab = 11 c?J had admitted him as his son and so
Umar '--"" 11 ~ ; made Zeyad the governor of Persia. Now Amir
Muawiya
.li1 <r'J gave him greater honor, promoted him and made
him the governor of Basra and instructed him to set and keep the
people of Basra on the right path. Having arrived in Basra, Zeyad
<-..,;.$,

The History of Islam

34

assembled the inhabitants of Basra in the Central Mosque and made a
grand and impressive speech. The people then had grown very
undisciplined. Theft, robbery and sedition were rampant everywhere.
Immediately after his arrival in Basra Zeyad instituted martial law
and ordered that whosoever went out of his house or was seen in the
field at night would be killed without any trial. That order was strictly
complied with and in a few days the people of Basra became humble.
Amir Muawiya = .'i., ~ J after making Zeyad and Mughira governors
of Basra and Kufa respectively was relieved of pressure from the Iraqi
and Persian fronts because all the provinces of Iran were under Kufa
and Basra.
Amir Muawiya ~ .'i.1 ~ J extended Zeyad's jurisdiction up to Persia,
Jazirah, the northern section of land between the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, and Sajistan . By including all these places in the jurisdiction of
the governor of Basra, he had put an end to all possible sedition in the
eastern territories. The Khawarij used to raise their heads off and on in
rebellion in Iraq and Persia but Zeyad and Mughira together stamped
them out very boldly and efficiently and did not allow any critical
situation to be created, which might add to Amir Muawiya's=.:;,, ~ J
troubles. Zeyad used not only strong measures in his jurisdiction but
also behaved mildly and made allowances as the situation demanded.
Once it was reported that Abu! Khair, who was a brave and intelligent
man, turned friendly to the Khawarij, Zeyad at once called for him
and sent him back by making him an official of Jundi Saboor and thus
he averted any future danger very wisely.
The governor of Egypt Amr bin Al-Aas = 11~ J died in 43 Hegira .
Amir Muawiya
.'i.1~ J appointed his son Abdullah bin Amr its
governor in his place. That same year when the Khawarij in Kufa saw
that Mughira did not behave harshly like Zeyad and sometimes over
looked the people's weak points, hatched a conspiracy for rebellion.
Had Zeyad been in place of Mughira, the Khawarij would no t have
dared such a bold step. Zeyad knew the Khawarij very well and the
inhabitants of Basra were humbled as mentioned earlier. Under the
command of Masturad bin Alqama more than three hundred Khwarij
left Kufa on 1 Shawwal 43 A.H., which corresponded to Eid al-Fitr
(the celebration after the month of fasting and one of the two official
<.....,;,;-

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

35

Muslim holidays) . Mughira sent an army of three thousand soldiers
after them. In ensuing battle, the three hundred Khawarij defeated the
three thousand soldiers from Kufa.
More men were sent and they also met the same fate . Al last, under
the command of Ma' qi! bin Qais a large army set out. As a
consequence, Ma' qi! bin Qais and Masturad bin Alqama were killed
while facing each other and all the Khawarij except five were
ex terminated, the impact of this event was so great that Mughira bin
Shoba paid more attention and was more cautious about the threat of
the Khawarij .
The northern borders of Syria always faced danger from the Roman
Empire. There was also the danger of a naval attack on the Syrian
coast. Egypt and North Africa were also under constant attack by the
Romans. Amir Muawiya = 11 ~ ) after settling the eastern problems,
spent all his energy and resources confronting the danger from the
Romans. He prepared a naval force and enhanced the salaries of the
sailors to attract others to join. He had two thousand war boats
prepared, made Junada bin Umayya the Admiral. He made the army
more powerful, arranged separately the defensive and offensive
armies besides enhancing the supply links. He divided the army into
two parts. The first was called Shitiwi, meaning winter forces and the
second was Saifia, meaning summer forces. In both seasons the army
kept a strict vigil on the borders by eliminating and suppressing the
Roman forces. The naval forces made the Island of Cyprus its
headquarters, they dispossessed the Roman forces from the
Mediterranean Sea and made the Egyptian and Syrian coasts safe
from enemy naval invasion. The adjoining provinces of Sajistan like
Rehaj were conquested. In the same year, the Islamic army made
advances towards Barqah, (historic region of North Africa and Sudan)
and thus the area of Islamic rule was considerably extended.

Invasion of Constantinople
In 48 A.H. after taking stock of the Roman emperor' s power, Amir
Muawiya = 11~) thought it necessary to launch a naval attack on the
Roman capital of Constantinople and put an end to the air of
invulnerability they enjoyed and shatter the future ambitions of the

36

The History of Islam

Christians in such a way that they would not dare to even look
towards the Islamic borders. He made up his mind to invade
Constantinople and made a declaration in Makkah and Madinah that
the Muslims were going to attack Constantinople. Since the
Companions knew the Prophet's ~ tradition, "The first army that
attacks the city of the Roman emperor, would be forgiven," the
illustrious Sahabas like Abdullah bin Umart...+-,- 11 ~;, Abdullah bin
Zubair, Abdullah bin Abbas, Husain bin Ali, and Abu Ayyub Ansari
~ 11 ~;, gladly participated in the hope of getting redemption. A
large army was prepared and he sent it to Constantinople under the
command of Sufyan bin Auf and a part of the army was commanded
by his son Yazid who was an officer of the summer forces, this army
proceeded by sea. Another part moved towards Constantinople by the
land route. The Muslims laid siege to the city, because the ramparts
and the location of the city were extremely strong, the siege and the
attacks were unsuccessful. A few great and lion-hearted men from the
Muslim side were martyred.
Abu A yyub Ansari ,._:s, 11 ~ ; died during the siege and was buried
under the city's ramparts. Due to severe cold and natural impediments, the Muslims returned without conquesting Constantinople.
Although the invasion was a failure and the city could not be brought
under the control of the Muslims, the consequences of the invasion
achieved an important objective. The Roman emperor and his army
considered themselves as lucky to avoid conquest and they did not
want to provoke another attack and put themselves in future danger
so the Romans ceased to attack the Islamic borders and all the
provinces under dispute between the Muslims and the Christian
finally came under the control of the Muslims.
In 50 A.H., Amir Muawiya ~ 11 ~ ) made Oqba bin Nafi the
commander in chief of Egypt, Barqah and Sudan, and afterwards sent
ten thousand more soldiers, he instructed his commander to advance
westward .and capture all of North African. The Berbers used to obey
the Muslims whenever the Islamic army,arrived there but as soon as
they found the Muslims relaxed and engaged somewhere else, they
rebelled and asserted their independence. Oqba bin Nafi passed
through Egypt and Barqah and invaded Tunis and Tripoli and after
capturing all these provinces, advanced towards Tlemcen, in the

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

37

northwestern part of modern day Algeria near Morocco. In the same
year the administrator of Makran, (the coastal area of modern day
Pakistan and Iran) and Baluchistan, (western most province of
modern day Pakistan), Abdullah bin Sawar, attacked Sindh, (province
of southeastern Pakistan), in order to discipline the Sindhis. The
Sindhis, who were fully prepared, faced him firmly . Abdullah bin
Sawar was martyred in the battle. Mahlab bin Abi Safra was
determined to be victorious and captured a large part of Sindh.

Yazid the Heir Apparent
During the same year, 50 A.H., Mughira left Kufa and came to
Damascus and told Amir Muawiya~ ..11 ~ J that he had seen the
events of Uthrnan bin Affan' s = ..11.._?J martyrdom in Madinah and all
those scenes of the subsequent horrors were passing before his eyes,
the malicious kinds of upheaval and disturbances that it created were
for the sake of gaining the Caliphate. "So I think is proper that you
should nominate your son, Yazid to be Caliph after you and in it lies
the security and welfare of the Muslims" . Amir Muawiya= ..11.._?J had
never planned to make his son the caliph. Mughira's words turned his
attention to it and gave him this idea. He said to Mughira, "Is it
possible that people would take ba'it for the Caliphate of my son?"
Mughira said, "This is quite possible. I shall persuade the people of
Kufa. Zayed bin Sufyan will force the people of Basra and in Makkah
and Madinah Marwan bin Hakam and Sayeed bin Aas will make the
people do so and as for Syria, there is no possibility of any
opposition." Hearing this Amir Muawiya '---'>- ..11 .._?J sent Mughira to
Kufa to execute the plan. This same incident has been found recorded
elsewhere as follows: "Amir Muawiya= ..11 .._?J wrote to Mughira bin
Shoba, the governor of Kufa, "that you should been yourself deposed
immediately after reading this letter." However, when that letter was
received by Mughira, he delayed its execution. When he reached Amir
Muawiya '---'>- ..11 .._?;, he enquired about the cause of delay in execution
of his orders. Mughira said, "I was engaged in getting ready for a
plan." Amir Muawiya = .'»1,..?J said, "What was that plan?" Mughira
said, "I was taking ba'it from the people for the future Caliphate of
your son. Amir Muawiya = ..11 .._?J was pleased to hear that and sent
him back to Kufa. When Mughira arrived in Kufa, the Kufis asked him

38

The History of Islam

about the affair, he said, "I have thrown him in such a mire that he
won't come out of it until doomsday." It is clearly known that it was
Mughira bin Shoba who was instrumental in persuading Amir
Muawiya ~ 11~
J for the idea of making his son the future Caliph,
which led to it becoming the convention of the reign of succession
among the Muslims, that the son succeeded his father or king and the
practice of selection by consultation was done away with. Yazid was
Amir Muawiya 's son and it was only natural for a father to love his
son and try to enhance his prestige and make him king. Amir
Muawiya=.;;,,.._,.;, J may to some extent be taken as helpless or weak but
no excuse can be offered on behalf of Mughira bin Shoba.
Mughira arrived in Kufa, called all the noblemen and those who were
influential among the Arabs to him and tried to convince them to
accept Yazid as the heir apparent. The influential people of Kufa
showed willingness and agreed with the intention of saving the
Muslims from all kinds of riots and disturbances and that the Amir ulMuminin should nominate his son to be Caliph after him. Mughira
then sent a delegation of illustrious Kufis along with his son to Amir
Muawiya = .\.,1<-r'J· It called on him and expressed its willingness that
ba'it for Yazid's caliphate should be taken. The arrival of that
delegation strengthened the intention and wish of Amir Muawiya <-r'J
~ .\.,1, which Mughira had already created in his mind. He saw the
delegation off with great honor and said to them, "When the time
comes ba'it from you will be taken." Amir Muawiya-..:... 1 1..,,.::. J was a
very far-sighted and scrupulous man. He wanted to know whether
the majority of the Islamic world agreed to his view or not. He then
wrote to Marwan bin Hakam, the governor of Madinah, and Zeyad
bin Abi Sufyan, the governor of Basra: "I have grown old. I do not
want any riots or disturbances to break out among the Muslims for the
sake of taking the caliphate. I want that in my lifetime I should
nominate someone to be caliph after me. Among the elders, I do not
see anybody who would be suitable and among the young, I suppose
my son, Yazid, seems to be the best. You should consult people and
make consultation about it cautiously and influence them to take ba'it
for Yazid's caliphate in the future. When the letter was received by
Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan the governor of Basra, he showed it to a man of
rank named Obaid bin Kab Numairi and told him, "In my opinion

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First ~hase)

39

Amir ul- Muminin has taken a hasty step in this affair. He has not
thought over it deeply because Yazid is a youth who leads a life of
entertainment. People know very well that he is fond of touring and
hunting and so they would certainly cause hesitation in taking ba'it.
Obadiah bin Kab said to him, "You need not express your
disagreement to the Amir ul- Muminin's view. Simply send me to
Damascus and I shall see Yazid and make him see reason and that he
should reform himself so that there will not be any hitch in the way of
taking ba'it for him. I am sure he will accept this advice. When his
conditions undergo a pleasant change, the people will also not hesitate
in taking ba'it, and the Amir ul-Muminin's wish will be fulfilled."
Zeyad appreciated the idea and immediately sent Obaid to Damascus.
Obaid made Yazid understand all the subtleties of the matter and
Yazid respected this advice, he reformed himself remarkabJy and
silenced the people on this point.
When the letter reached Marwan in Madinah, he assembled the
noblemen there and read to them this much, "the Amir ul-Muminin
has the intention of saving the Muslims from all possible riots and
disturbances by nominating someone to be caliph after him." All
appreciated the idea and expressed their willingness to support it. A
few days after Marwan again assembled the people and read to them, .
"Another letter from Amir Muawiya '-'->-11 ,_,:,,; has come from
Damascus. He has written that in view of the betterment of Muslims
he has nominated Yazid as the heir apparent." At this time Abdur
Rahman bin Abi Bakr, Abdullah bin Umar, Abdullah bin Zubair and
Husain bin Ali~ 11 <?; expressed great resentment. They said, "This
selection has been made not for the welfare of the Muslims but for
their annihilation because by this way the Islamic Caliphate will
resemble the Roman and Persian empires in which the son succeeds
his father to the throne this selection is against the spirit of Islam."
As a parenthesis, here attention should be drawn to the fact when
Marwan bin Hakam proclaimed in Madinah Amir Muawiya's
intention, Imam Hasan ~ 11 <?; had died a few months before. The
people generally knew that at the time of reconciliation with Imam
Hasan '-'->-11 ~
;, Amir Muawiya= 11 <?; in accordance with efforts
made by Abdullah bin Amir, was ready to have the declaration that

40

The History of Islam

Imam Hasan = .lll <?; should be made Caliph after him included into
the treaty of compromise although Imam Hasan = .lll <?) did not have
it mentioned in the treaty of peace. The people thought that although
the future Caliphate of Imam Hasan= .11._?; did not find mention in
the treaty, the Islamic world would agree to his Caliphate. When
Marwan bin Hakam first read Amir Muawiya's letter in Madinah,
most of the people felt that it was due to Imam Hasan's death that
Amir Muawiya '----'S-.lll <?; had the idea in his heart to nominate some
one, since Imam Hasan= .:.1 ,_?; had died and he was considered to be
the next logical choice, another nominee should be chosen as the
future caliph. Their thinking was based on Amir Muawiya's nobility
and love of justice, this created a ray of hope in the hearts of those
who considered themselves to be worthy of the caliphate. When
Marwan made the second proclamation about Yazid, the concept
created by his first proclamation, suddenly dissipated and
immediately various kinds of doubts were being expressed . Some
people went to the extent of speculating that it was Amir Muawiya~)
= .ll1 who had Imam Hasan= .lll ~ J poisoned. Before the proclamation
of Yazid's nomination, no one harbored any thought connecting Imam
Hasan' s death to Amir Muawiya 's = .:.1._?) efforts or intention.
Here it is pertinent to draw the attention of the respected readers that
Amir Muawiya <-....:.s- .:.1 ~) was absolutely impeccable concerning any
involvement in the poisoning of Imam Hasan= .ll1 ~ J and that it was
Mughira bin Shoba who after Imam Hasan's death drew Amir
Muawiya's ~ .:.1~) attention to Yazid's nomination. He himself had
never thought about it.
Just as Mughira bin Shoba was instrumental in getting Yazid
nominated as the future Caliph, he also did his best to supervise this
endeavor to that end. Amir Muawiya ~ .:.1 ...,.:.,; was silent to the
resentment expressed by the people of Madinah and the Hijaz which
he came to know through Marwan' s letter and thought how to
persuade the people of Madinah to his point of view. At that time, he
received the news that Mughira bin Shoba = .:.1 ~) died in Kufa. That
was in 51 A.H. Hearing this news he handed over the government of
Kufa to Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan and Zeyad came to be known as the
governor of Iragain (the two Irags).

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

41

Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan in Kufa
In handing over to Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan the governorship of Basra
and Kufa the practical benefit was that he could persuade all the
people of Iraq to take ba'it for Yazid's caliphate and nobody else could
have performed this task so well. Besides, Mughira was somewhat
soft hearted and forgiving. However, Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan was more
familiar with the nature of Iraqis. He knew that if they were not dealt
with sternly, they could not be expected to be on the right path. That
was why the tenure of his rule was highly successful and he was the
first person who was made the governor of Kufa and Basra both and
later on the whole of Iran and Khorasan up to Turkistan was handed
over to him. Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan made Samura bin Jundub his
deputy in Basra and he himself, along with two thousand people, set
out for Kufa. When he started giving the Khutba (the Friday sermon)
in the Central Mosque in Kufa, the Kufis who were accustomed to
humiliate their officers and disobey the government officials, started
mocking him, they began to shower pebbles over him. He stopped the
Khutba and ordered his men to surround the mosque and not to let
anyone out of it. Then he sat in the chair at the door of the mosque
and by calling four persons at a time, began to ask whether they had
thrown the pebbles. Thirty people were found to have done so. He let
off the others and had the hands of the thirty guilty ones cut off.
Similar punishments were awarded to the other Kufis for their faults.
Consequently, in a matter of days they were humbled. Zeyad began to
live in Kufa and Basra alternatively for six months each.

:,.1 c?J issued a declaretion to all his officials to the
Amir Muawiya
effect that they should narrate Yazid's good traits and send
delegations of the influential people of their respective territories to
him (Amir Muawiya '---"" :i.1c?J) in order that he might also talk to the
people regarding Yazid's ba'it. Afterwards, delegations from all the
territories arrived in Damascus. Amir Muawiya ~ .'"i.1 -?_; talked to
them separately and then arranged a meeting and asked them to
attend it. He then stood up and read a Khutba in which after praising
Allah and the Prophet ii, dwelt at length on the virtues of Islam, rights
and duties of caliphs, obedience to the rulers and duties of the masses.

He then talked about Yazid's manliness, gener.osity, wisdom, thinking
power and his ability for administration. At the end, he expressed his
wish that they should take ba'it for Yazid's caliphate. Among the
delegates from Madinah was Mohammad bin Amr bin Hazam, he
stood up and said," Amir ul- Muminin ! You are going to make Yazid
Caliph but kindly think over it a little that you will have to answer to
Allah on the Day of Judgement for this act of yours." Amir Muawiya
~ .11 ~
J said, "I am thankful to you that you wished me well
according to your view. But the fact is that there in none but young
boys at this hour and my son among them deserves it most." Then
Dhahak bin Qais stood up and in an eloquent speech, he strongly
supported Amir Muawiya= ...';,1 <?J· Then a few more persons stood up
and all of them supported him. Ahnaf bin Qais from Egypt was also
there. When the series of speeches came to an end, Amir Muawiya <?J
--.:.s-11 turned to Ahnaf bin Qais and asked why he was silent. He said,
"If T tell a lie, I fear Allah; if I speak the truth, I fear you. Why do you
consult us on this issue? You know Yazid better than us and at your
insistence, we are ready to take ba'it." Amir Muawiya= . .';, ..r"J took
those words to be a sign from God and he pleased Almaf afterwards
by rewarding him greatly. Thus enriched with good rewards the
foreign delegates returned highly pleased. Amir Muawiya = ...';,1 ..r"J
was very much perturbed about the people of Hijaz, Makkah and
Madinah because it was there that the people might oppose him
boldly. At the end of 51 A.H., he thought of going for the Hajj,
thinking that he might be able to convert the people of Hijaz to his
own opinion. Consequently, he first went to Madinah. H earing of his
arrival Abdullah bin Zubair, Abdullah bin Umar, Abdullah bin Abbas
and Husain bin Ali ~ ...';,1 ~ ; went to Makkah. Having reached
Madinah, Amir Muawiya ~ . .';, <?J amply rewarded the people and
won them over his to side and instructed Marwan bin Hakam to
enhance their daily allowances, give them loans from the state
treasury and not insist on its collection in order to avoid opposition
and in this way oblige them. Then he proceeded to Makkah. Reaching
there, he called the four persons mentioned who objected to him and
talked about Yazid's ba'it. Abdullah bin Umar = 11._?; said, "I can
admit this much that I will accept as Caliph the man on whom there is
a popular consensus. Even if a slave is made caliph I shall obey him

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

43

and not part with the Jarnat." Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 ._,.;,J said, "I put
before you a few points. You are at liberty to choose whichever suits
you (1) You must act upon the Sunnah of the Prophet * and leave the
issue of Caliphate without nominating anyone on the Muslims so that
they might elect the caliph whom they want. If you do not like it, then
you act upon the Sunnah of Abu Bakr= ..11._,.;,J and depute to your post
a man who comes neither from your tribe nor your family and if this is
also not to your liking, then emulate Umar bin Khattab = 11 ._,.;,J by
nominating six persons who are neither of your family or tribe nor
your own son. Those six persons should be at liberty to choose anyone
as caliph from among themselves. There is no fourth alternative
except these three to which we may agree." Others also seconded
Abdullah. After Hajj Amir Muawiya ~ 11 ~J took bay'ah for the
caliphate of Yazid from all the people of Makkah except the four
persons mentioned above. He gave money to the general people.
There is no doubt that Amir Muawiya= 11._,.;,J, in order to convert the
people to his opinion, used his wealth and it is just possible that he
might have had the conviction that Yazid's nomination was really
beneficial to the world of Islam and its harmful aspect might have
been hidden from him. When he returned to Damascus after Hajj, he
heard of the demise of Abu Musa Ashari ~ 11._,.;,J in Kufa. Amir
Muawiya ~ 11~ ) had already made Zeyad the ruler of Basra and
Kufa and moreover the area up to Sajistan was under him. Now he
thought it proper to put under Zeyad's control all the eastern
countries up to Sindh, Kabul, Balkh, Khorasan and Turkistan. Zeyad's
stature became so high that he began to appoint the governors of
Persia and Khorasan according to his own choice and depose who
ever he wanted. Zeyad managed and administrated these eastern
countries very efficiently and did not give any chance to the Khwarij
to rebel. Zeyad was a great asset and help to Amir Muawiya= 11 ._,.;,J
and he was fortunate to have had such an able and qualified person at
his disposal. If Zeyad had not been able to maintain peace in the
eastern territories, uprisings of the Khwarij and mischief of the
Munafiqin, (hypocrites) would not have given him enough time to
make the many arrangements for Yazid's bay'ah. Besides, the impact
of disturbances in the eastern territories would also have had a bad
affect on the western territories and would not have given him any

44

The History of Islam

peace and security to accomplish his other projects.
Amir Muawiya = .:iii ,.?J had made Maslama bin Mukhallad governor
of Egypt and Africa after Abdullah bin Amr. Oqba bin Nafe Fihri who
was advancing towards the west, Tripoli, Tlemcen and Morocco and
whom Amir Muawiya ~ .:ill ..,,----;,J himself had deputed on that
expedition was now brought under the command of the Egyptian
governor Maslama bin Mukhallad. Makkah and Madinah were under
the governorship of Sayeed bin Aas and Marwan bin Hakam. Syria
and Palestine were under the direct administration of Amir Muawiya
~ .:iii ..,,----;,J- Oqba bin Nafe Fihri in view of the requirements of North
Africa, laid the foundation of the city of Qairwan by cutting down the
forest. The cantonment for Africa at Qairwan was as indispensable to
North Africa as Basra and Kufa was to Iraq.
As soon as the population of Qairwan reached its peak in 55 A.H.,
Maslama bin Mukhallad deposed Oqba bin Nafe and appointed his
slave Abul Muhajir the commander-in-chief. Oqba bin Nafe then was
reassigned to Amir Muawiya = ..:ill ,.?J in Damascus. When the great
advisers like Marwan, Sayeed, and Oqba and the valiant chiefs from
the Arabs were assembled in Damascus and while Zeyad bin Abi
Sufyan kept the flag of victory flying over the Islamic cities, the bay' ah
for Yazid was taken by the whole Islamic world in 56 A.H. Only four
persons, Abdullah bin Zubair, Abdullah bin Umar, Abdullah bin Abbas
and Husain bin Ali r+" ..:ill ,.?J did not take the ba'it. Amir Muawiya ,.?J
= .:ill left them on their own and did not think it proper to force them.

The death of Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan
In 53 A. H., Zeyad bin Abu Sufyan died of plague. His death dealt a
hard blow to Amir Muawiya
.:iii ,.?J· Zeyad had requested to be
made the governor of the Hijaz and the rest of the Arabs besides
Iraq and Persia. Amir Muawiya ~ .:ill ..,,----;, J granted his request.
However, the inhabitants of the Hijaz were extremely terrified when
they heard this and they went to Abdullah bin Umar to seek a way
to be safe from Zeyad's rule. They made a Du'a (prayer or
supplication to Allah) by turning their faces to Ka'bah and all

=

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

45

together, they said Amen. That prayer resulted in the appearance of
a pimple on Zeyad's finger ultimately leading to his death. He died
in Kufa during the sacred month of Ramadan. Zeyad had given the
governorship of Kufa to Khalid bin Usaid on his own accord. When
he died, his son Obaidullah was 25 years old. Amir Muawiya .:i.il ,..?;
~ asked him about the governorships that his father had given to
the people. Abdullah replied that Samura bin Jundub was made the
governor of Basra and Khalid bin Usaid was appointed governor of
Kufa, Amir Muawiya = .:r.,1 ,..?; asked him "What governorship did
you get?" Obaidullah said, "I have not been given the governorship
of any territory." Amir Muawiya = .:r.,1 ,..?; said, "Since your father
did not give you the governorship of any territory, I shall also not
make you the governor of any territory either." Obaidullah said,
"What greater humiliation is there for me than that neither my
father appointed me governor nor you, my uncle would do so."
Amir Muawiya= .:r.,1 ,..?; pondered over it for some time and then he
appointed him supreme officer of Basra, Khorasan (northeastern
Iran, southern Turkamanistan, and northern Afghanistan) and
Persia. Sayeed bin Uthman bin Affan = .:r.,1 ,..?; had taken bay'ah, (oath
of allegiance) for Yazid. When he came to know that Abdullah bin
Zubair, Abdullah bin Abbas, and Husain bin Ali~ .:i.i1 ,..?;, did not
take the bay'ah, he said, "My father was not inferior to the fathers
of these people. I have unjustly taken ba'it for Yazid." Then he
went to Amir Muawiya = .:r.,1 ,..?J and said to him, "My father had
not done any wrong to you. Tell me what is your obligation on
me?" Amir Muawiya
.:i.i1 ~ ; then took away the province of
Khorasan from Obaidullah bin Zeyad and gave it to Sayeed bin
Uthman. He then made Muhallab bin Abu Sufra Sayeed's helper
and commander-in-chief. He sent Marwan and Sayeed to Madinah
and Makkah to govern.
'---.:,$,

No sooner had Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan died than the Khawarij raised
their heads and Obaidullah bin Zeyad, immediately after taking over

the reins of Basra, had to face them. The groups of Khawarij started
launching attacks incessantly and up to the time of Amir Muawiya's
~ .:r.,1 ~ ; death, Obaidullah bin Zeyad remained engaged in
disciplining and humbling them.

The History of Islam

The death of Aisha ~ 1», ~)
After the death in 58 A. H., Ummul-Muminin Aisha ~ .11~; was
buried in Jannat al-Baqi. She used to oppose Marwan because his
deeds were not good.
In 59 A. H. Abu Huraira = .1, ,?; died. He often made the Du'a, "O
Allah! I seek your protection against the rule of young boys." His
prayer was accepted and he died before 60 A. H.

The death of Amir Muawiya ;.;.s, k, ~)
Amir Muawiya ~ .11 ~ ; fell ill in the beginning of Rajab 60 A.H.
During that illness when he was sure that his time had come, he called
for Yazid. Yazid at that time was on a hunting trip or expedition
outside of Damascus. At once, a messenger was sent to bring him.
When Yazid came, he addressed him thus:
"O my son! Listen to my words attentively and answer my questions.
Now the Decree of Allah, the time of my death, has come. Tell me,
how do you want to treat the Muslims?"
Yazid said, "I shall follow the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the
Prophet :l/$."
Amir Muawiya ,.__;.;. .11 ~ ; said, "You should also follow the Sunnah of
Abu Bakr ~ .11~ ; who fought with the apostates and died such a
death that people were pleased with him."
Yazid said, "No, I shall follow the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the
Prophet~."
Amir Muawiya ""'.1, ,?; said again, "O my son! Follow the conduct of
Umar bin Khattab ~ .1, ~ ; he populated cities, improved the
capability of the army and distributed the spoils of war among the
soldiers."
Yazid said, "No, following the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the
Prophet ~ is enough."
Amir Muawiya ""'.11 ~; said, "O my son! Follow the way of Uthman

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

47

bin Affan ~ :.1 ,?J he did good to the people during his life time and
was generous."

Yazid said, "No, the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet ~
are enough for me."
When Amir Muawiya
:.1 ,?J heard him, he said, "O my son! Your
talk has convinced me that you will not follow my advice. You will go
against my will. 0 Yazid, don't be proud that I have made you my
heir-apparent and the people have taken the oath of allegiance for
your succession. You have no danger from Abdullah bin Umar :., ,?J
~ because he is weary of this world. The Iraqis will certainly put
Husain bin Ali ~ :., ~ J against you. If you gain victory over him,
don't slay him and give due regard for kinship. Abdullah bin Zubair
.....:s :.1 ~; is a deceitful person. If you get the better of him, slay him.
Always accommodate the inhabitants of Makkah and Madinah. If the
Iraqis want a change in their functionaries, keep changing them for
their pleasure. Regard the Syrians as your helpers and rely on their
friendship ."
<_;.;.

Yazid then left and rejoined the hunt party. Amir Muawiya's
condition started deteriorating day after day until he breathed his last
on Thursday, 22 Rajab 60 A. H . He was 70 years old at the time of his
death.
He had in his possession some hair and a nail of the Prophet~- At his
death, he left in his will that these should be put into his mouth and
on his eyes. Dhahak bin Qais led the funeral prayer. He was buried in
between Bab Jabia (Jabia gate) and Bab Sagheer (Sagheer gate) in
Damascus.

A Glance at Amir Muawiya's 4:-S- ..11, ~) Caliphate
The 20-year-long reign of Amir Muawiya ~ :., ,?J must be called
successful because during that period none of the claimants to the
caliphate or his rivals dared to rebel against him. During his reign, the
Islamic territory expanded in all the four directions. No Islamic
territory or province remained apart from his government. No
rebellion of any consequence broke out. No robberies and disorder,
which were found in Iraq and Iran during Ali's time, existed any

48

The History of Islam

more. The Muslims began fighting naval battles and even the Romans
and the Christians acknowledged their superiority as a naval power.
During his age, Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan and certain other governers
justified the continued subjection of the Iraqis and Iranians to coercion
and violence. If the Iraqis and Iranians were not dealt with harshly, it
would have been considered an injustice and taken as negligence of
the part of Amir Muawiya. It was he who first appointed postmen and
established a system and organization and called it the postal
department. He was the first who invented the system of putting a
seal on orders and keeping a copy of every order preserved in the
caliph's office. His seal contained the inscription "yl} J-" J50", for every
deed there is a reward. Until his time, the cover on the Ka'bah was
put on top of the old covers. He had all the old covers removed and
gave instructions that whenever a new cover was put on, the old cover
should be removed. He was the first in Islam to introduce the system
of keeping watchmen and door keepers. He was also the first to
establish the registry department. He was the first to have ships built
and prepare a naval force.
Amir Muawiya= .&1 <?J, no doubt, wanted to establish his rule and for
his clan and family to have superiority in power over Banu Hashim.
However, in fulfilling his wish, he did not want to give a chance to
any of the enemies of Banu Umayyah and Banu Hashim or the
enemies of Muawiya and Ali to perpetrate a reign of terror or to harm
the Islamic government. That is why once when Ay and Muawiya <r°J
~ .&1 were in opposition, a huge Christian army was planning to
attack on the eastern provinces of Iran, which was under Ali's rule
and they wanted to take advantage of the disunity among the
Muslims. Ali = 11 <r"J was incapable of defending these places, which
were targeted to come under attack by the Christians and if the
Christians attacked, a large of part of the Islamic territory would have
been lost. The Christians were aware of the difficulties Ali = 11 <? J
was facing and therefore felt there would be no threat from Amir
Muawiya's side as they had been following the mutual opposition
between Muawiya and Ali and their use of force against each other.
They expected that Amir Muawiya= 11 <r"J would like them to attack
Ali ..__... 11 <r"J· However, as soon as Amir Muawiya= 11 <r"J heard that
news, he, contrary to the expectations of the Christian emperor, wrote

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

49

to the emperor, "You should not be deceived by our infighting. If you
turn towards Ali = 11 er" J the first chief who advances to punish you
under Ali's flag, will be Muawiya." The impact of that letter was far
more than an army and the Christians gave up the idea.
The nature of the difference or opposition that existed between Ali <.f"J
'----'-" 11 and Amir Muawiya ~ 11 ~ J was not as is conceived by the
Muslims of today, which is due to their ignorance and lack of
understanding of the facts. In order to arrive at a correct judgment, we
must not forget the fact that Ali's brother Aqil bin Abi Talib= .1i1 <.f"J
was Amir Muawiya's friend and Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan, ther brother
of Amir Muawiya was appointed governor of Iran by Ali = 11 er" J· Ali
= 11 <.f"J fully trusted Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan. Aqil bin Abi Talib used to
admonish Amir Muawiya= 11 <.f"J in the open court and yet the latter
always indulged him.

Answer to a doubt
Before closing the chapter on the caliphate of Amir Muawiya= 11 <.f"J,
it is necessary to clear up a common doubt.
Ali
11 ~ J was trained and tutored by the Prophet ~ and was
included in his family and kept constant company with him. He was
also his (:i) cousin and son-in-law. Amir Muawiya= 11 <.f"J was the
Prophet's scribe of the Revelations, his friend, his brother-in-law by
virtue of being Umm Habiba's brother, and his Companion. Why did
Ali = 11 <.f"J and Amir Muawiya "'f 11 <.f"J oppose and fight each other?
Again, why did a sizable number of illustrious Sahabah like 'Amr bin
Al-Aas, Talha, Zubair r-P 11 <.f"J and Aisha~ 11 <.f"J, participate in the
infighting and opposition between them. On the surface there seems
to be no difference between the infighting of these illustrious Sahabah
and that of the people of today, then should it not be admitted that the
Prophet's company did not produce in them the effect which we
expected them to imbibe?
4-..;.s.

The answer to this doubt or objection is not hard to understand. There
is not doubt that the Sahabah as whole were certainly the stars of
Hidayat (guidance) and the Prophet's company undoubtedly
impressed upon them as much as it was expected. It is our lack of

50

The History of Islam

understanding and the short sightedness of our hearts that causes us
to harbor such doubts. It should be noted that the Shari'ah, the Islamic
legal system, which the Prophet ~ brought contains fully all the
principles for the welfare and prosperity of mankind. He (:!ii;) fulfilled
his obliga~ion of instruction and propagation of this complete and
perfect Shari' ah. After him, there would come no other Shari' ah until
the end of this world. As this Shari' ah is enjoined on us until the Day
of Judgement, and mankind needs it for its reformation and welfare,
therefore there must be a protection for this grand Shari' ah from the
degeneration that befell other Shari'ahs (systems of law). Therefore,
for the satisfaction of mankind Allah Himself has said:
"We have, without ,doubt sent down the the Message and We will
assuredly guard it (from corruption) ." It is clear that Allah Himself
will keep providing protection to it in accordance with the
requirements of the time. During the last one thousand four hundred
plus years, we have seen how Allah Himself made arrangements for
its safeguard. Just as we did nothing to propose and provide
protection to ourselves when we were in our mother's wombs, just as
we did not advise Allah to raise vapor out of the sea, make clouds,
blow wind and send down rain to keep our fields green, similarly how
are we justified in proposing ways and making arrangements for the
protection of the Islamic Shari' ah and dare to force Him to adopt a
particular way and use the tools of our choice? We can wish ready
made bread would rain down from the heaven, and cooked meat, fish
or vegetable dishes be raised from the earth but Allah cannot be our
subordinate. He turned the seawater into vapor with the scorching
rays of the sun, then the high air bore it and took it to another place,
then its heat and freezing power created changes and caused the rain.
Then the peasants made the land soft with the help of their oxen and
equipment, and sowed seeds. Plants grew and they were looked after.
When they ripened, they were harvested. Grain and chaff were
separated. Then the grain was ground in a mill. It was kneaded and
then by using a particular technique, bread was prepared.
Contemplate it and see how in providing a loaf of bread Allah has
chosen a prolonged and complex process. It would only be our
foolishness if we blame Allah and prefer our proposed short cuts.
Calling Allah's work lengthy is nothing but our shortsightedness

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

51

because the countless benefits, which are present in this complicated
process and series of efforts, are hidden from our short sight and
imperfect understanding.
Keeping this concept in mind and you contemplate it, you must admit
that the venerable Sahaba' s internecine conflicts were in reality
arrangements made by Allah for the safety and protection of the
Shari' ah, confirmation of the wisdom. The significant point is that the
differences of opinion among Amir Muawiya ~ .11..?J, Ali bin Abi
Talib ....s .iii ..?J and other illustrious Sahabas were based on their Ijtihad
(the pronouncement or understanding of the learned on an issue when
Qur' an, Hadith, and Sunnah have not clarified this issue). If any of
them were wrong, it was not intentional. None of them were the type
of Muslims who could be persuaded to knowingly oppose the Islamic
Shari' ah, Allah's Commands or the Prophet's sayings.
Whatever Ali bin Abi Talib 4-C>- .iii ,._,:.,J did he thought it was right.
Similarly, what Amir Muawiya -= .11..?J has done, he did it thinking
himself justified. The same was the case with the other Sahabah.
Whosoever they found justified, they favored that one, and all these
occurrences happened in accordance with the Will of Allah. By
creating these inner conflicts and disputes, Allah reserved a group of
Sahabas for these affairs while the other group, disliked all of the
dissension and infighting and cut themselves off from governmental
affairs and took to an ascetic life. When there were no internal
disputes, all efforts of the Sahabas were put into resisting and facing
the disbelievers and making victories on the battlefield. The regimes
of Abu Bakr and Umar bin Khattab ~ .11 ,._,:.,J were full of such
skirmishes and battles. All the Sahabas had their eyes fixed on the
battlefield and the conquesting of territory. Though during the
caliphate of these two Sahabas, the work of the compilation of the
Qur'an was done, it should have been completed at the beginning of
the period. However, it was not feasible at that time for the required
group of illustrious Sahabas to retire from jihad and concentrate all
their attention and energy on ordering and organizing the Fiqh
(science of the application of the Shari'ah), and protecting and
propagating the Prophet's traditions. Madinah Munawwara had
turned into a military cantonment with a camp that had its ruler
sitting on a mat and before whom was always spread the maps of

52

The History of Islam

war-strategies and great governors were seen engaged in determining
specific martial policies and making plans and keeping watch on the
movements of their commanders of the many armies that were
deployed. As Jhe circle of victories widened, these martial
engagements increased, those who were teachers and gave lessons on
the Shari' ah and explained its subtleties, became busy sharpening
swords and straightening the feathers of arrows and making
themselves prepared to face the blades of their enemies' spears. Those
martial displays were very essential at that time in order to safeguard
Islam and keep the Muslims fearless. During the caliphate of Umar
bin Khattab = 11 -..? J these necessary military requirements were done
and Islam came to be known as a victorious religion and the greatest
military power. After that, the immediate requirement was to protect
the perfect system of Islam and all aspects of the Shari' ah, and make
available to the group of venerable Sahabas, the Companions of the
Prophet ~, the opportunity and free time necessary to prepare a group
of Taba'yeen, those who saw the Companions but did not see the
Prophet ~, in order to educate the future generations, and thereby
preserving the Islamic way of life. Allah with His Divine Power,
created Abdullah bin Saba and his followers, a group of Jews
appearing to be Muslims and made provision for the martyrdom of
Omar "--'S- 11 ~ J , the battle of Jamal and the battle of Siffin each event
after the other. The consequence was that many of the Sahabas who
were the conquering heroes of their enemies like Rustam and
Asfandyar on the battlefield, put away their bows and swords and
retired, and left the work of commanding military expeditions and
became engaged in teaching. In the previous pages we have read how
Sad bin Abi Waqas "--'S- 11 ~ J , the victor of Iran and under whose
command the Muslims attained victory in the battle of Qadisiya,
which had witnessed so much blood-shed, preferred to retire and take
to tending flocks of goats and camels instead of participating in
internecine disputes. This was also the case with many other Sahabas.
When the series of victories stopped and internal differences
appeared, many of the Sahabas began to regard the use of swords and
arrows as bad. If this was not the case, there was no other possible
way to remove them from the front row of the battlefield and bring
them back to the rearguard.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

53

Abdullah bin Umar = 11 ,?; was the one person whose caliphate the
entire Islamic world would have agreed to but the internal clashes
forced him to live a life of withdrawal. In this book, we have read the
same names of certain people many times, who were somehow
involved in these disputes. However, there were a great number of
Sahabas who did not take part in them and so their names are not
mentioned in connection with these historical events. This dignified
group, during that tumultuous times, enabled the people, who visited
them with great respect in their hearts, to understand the reality of the
Islamic Shari' ah and acquainted them with the character of the
Prophet ~- Each of them became a teacher in their own right and
became busy educating others in the understanding of the Shari' ah.
Madinah Munawwara was the cradle of the Muhajirin and Ansar and
Makkah was the second center of Islam due to Ka'bah. As long as the
Sahaba did not have time for learning and teaching, Madinah
remained the capital. When Allah wanted to use the Sahaba for
teaching Islam, He shifted the capital of the caliphate from Madinah,
and Madinah, which only a short time before, was the center of
martial power and military cantonments turned into a Dar ul-Ulum
(Center of Knowledge). If we critically and minutely read the books
on Hadith and Fiqh, the truth will be revealed that the primary
material on Hadith, Fiqh and Tafseer is the gift of that age during
which there were differences among the believers.
Had these differences not appeared and had Amir Muawiya and Ali
bin Abi Talib ~ 11 ,?; not fought with each other, wewould have
been deprived of a major and essential part of the Islamic Shariah. But
why did it start taking place? Allah Himself is the Protector of this
religion and He Himself makes provision for its safely. He decreed
that there would be differences between Ali and Amir Muawiya 11 ,?;
~ and the opportunities that followed.
Now we look at another aspect of this issue. Almost all the examples
of obstacles, difficulties and complications that are possible for a
government, sultanate or a system of culture to face, which have been
witnessed in the world until now were present in the clashes between
Amir Muawiya and Ali bin Abi Talib ~ 11 ~;- In view of the
emergence of these hardships, the morals and efforts that have been

54

The History of Islam

displayed by the various rulers, ruling dynasties and kings, the most
praiseworthy and the best of these morals and efforts are those of the
venerable Sahaba in such situations. The history of the world is replete
with the rise and fall of governments and nations, successes and
failures. No age or regime is free from cunningness, conspiracies or
deceits. When we make research about these things, we find that the
accounts of the clashes of Ali bin Abi Talib and Amir Muawiya ..'i.1.;?,~ present the most honorable examples of all, and we can succeed
by choosing the best style of functioning and the best guidelines for
us. It is our blindness and misfortune that instead of making the
Sahaba's differences in Ijtihad and the clashes of Amir Muawiya ..'i.1 .;?J
= and Ali bin Abi Talib = ..'i.1 .?J a source of important lessons, insight
and profit, we have turned them into tools for our disunity, bestiality,
poverty and misfortune.
The lines mentioned above may raise the objection that the limitations
of the writing of history have been trespassed. But I have already
admitted that I am writing this book not as an atheist empirical
historian but as a Muslim. I am a Muslim and it is for the Muslims that
I have begun to write this book. Therefore, nothing can deter me from
expressing this idea.
Now before closing the chapter on Amir Muawiya= ..'i.1 .;?J we would
like to quote the Honorable
Syed Amir Ali, former chief justice of the
.,
High Court in Calcutta from his book entitled 'The History of Islam'
using Masoodi as his reference: "Amir Muawiya= ..'i.1 .;?.; daily after
Fajr prayer used to hear reports of the local superintendents of the
military police or police captains. After. that, he used to come to see
the ministers, advisors, and chief associates of the government in
connection with foreign expeditions. In this meeting the sub-ordinate
court officials and administrators would read to him the reports and
letters that came from the provinces. At Noon time he would come out
of the palace to lead the prayer and sit down in the mosque itself.
There he would listen to the complaints of the people, receive their
requests and then go back to the palace and meet other dignitaries.
Then he would take the midday meal and then take a short nap. After
'Asr prayer, he would meet the ministers, associates and advisors. He
used to take supper in the court together with them all and give them

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

one more opportunity to see him and this ended the day's work." An
interesting note about quoting the Honorable Amir Ali is that he has
been considered as leaning towards the Shia faith and would in that
case not normally attribute anything favorable to Amir Muawiya.
On the whole, during Amir Muawiya's regime, the series of conquests
continued both within and without.
'Amr bin Aas ~ 11 ~ j says: "I have not seen a man of greater
perseverance and humility than Amir Muawiya= 11 i?j· One day it so
happened that I was present in his court and he was sitting with a
pillow at his back. He received a report that the Roman emperor was
about to attack with a huge army. Having read that paper, he threw it
to me. I read it and waited to watch his reaction. However, he kept
sitting in the same posture. He said nothing. A few minutes after that
another report came that Nayel bfn Qais, the leader of the Khawarij,
had collected an army and was about to invade Palestine. This report
was also passed to me and he said nothing. I read it and kept waiting
for his order all the more anxious but he continued to remain in the
same position. There was no trace of any change on his face. It was not
long when a third report came to the effect that the Khawarij captives
at Mosul broke open the jail and fled away and that they were
collecting near Mosel. Amir Muawiya= 11 i?j read it also and threw it
towards me and kept sitting with the support of the pillow at the back.
A few minutes more and then another letter arrived with the news
that Ali bin Abi Talib= ./;;1 i?j with a large army, was about to launch
an attack on Syria. That letter was also thrown towards me. He
maintained his position as before".
"My patience grew thin. I said to him, 'Pieces of bad news are pouring
in from all sides. What will you do now?' He said, 'Though the Roman
emperor commands a big army, he will return after signing an
agreement with me. Nayel bin Qais fights for the cause of his religion.
He has captured a city and wants to keep it under his control. I shall
spare him so that he might be pre-occupied with it. The Khawarij who
fled from the jail cannot escape from Allah's jail. But as for Ali's affair,
we have to think and plan how to avenge Uthman bin Affan's blood.'
Then he sat up and immediately issued orders for the settlement of
each issue, and then sat down with the pillow at his back."

Having watched Amir Muawiya's ~ 11 ~; pomp and grandeur in
Syria, Umar bin Khattab ..,_ 11 ~) observed, "Just as there are Kisra in
Persia and Caesar in Rome, similarly there is Amir Muawiya= 11 ~)
in the Arab land."

Yazid bin Muawiya
When Amir Muawiya= ii!I ~) was the governer of the whole of Syria,
Abu Khalid Yazid bin Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan was born in 25 A.H.
or 26 A.H. His mother's name was Maisoon hint Bahdal who came
from the tribe of Banu Kalab. He was very fat. His body was covered
with a thick growth of hair. He was born into kingship and wealth.
Amir Muawiya = 11 ~; was a very scrupulous and far-sighted man.
He paid special attention to Yazid's upbringing and education. He
sent him to Hajj as Amir-ul-Hajj (Hajj group leader) once or twice and
gave him the command of an army. He was commander of a part of
the army at the time of the attack and siege of Syria. He was very fond
of hunting. At the time of Amir Muawiya's death, he was not present
in Damascus. He was sent for by messenger but failing to realize the
seriousness of his illness, he went back to his hunting expedition. He
returned after several days and offered the funeral prayer at his
father's grave. He was also well versed in composing poems. In Amir
Muawiya's lifetime bay'at for him was taken. But most people were
unhappy with for this. A few great persons in Madinah Munawwara
even refused to take bay' at for him.
Amir Muawiya ~ iu1 .,,.---;,; committed a blunder by taking bay'at for
Yazid in his lifetime that was probably the result of his paternal
affection for him. But Mughira bin Shoba's blunder exceeded his,
because the idea and the courage to act upon it came from Mughira
bin Shoba' s instigation. Hasan Basri has therefore said: Mughira bin
Shoba created the opportunity of introducing a practice that put an
end to consultation and the son started succeeding his father as king.
After Amir Muawiya ~ iu1 .,,.---;,;, the Syrians, without any hesitation,
took bay'at at Yazid's hands. The people of other provinces also
followed their officials and dared not refuse for fear of the
government. Immediately after taking the reins in his hands, Yazid
wrote to the officials of all the provinces to take bay'at from the people

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

57

in his name. On that occasion Madinah and Kufa were governed by
Waleed bin Utba bin Abi Sufyan and Noman bin Bashir respectively
both were noble-minded and peace-loving persons; compared to other
officials, they were less strict.
When Yazid's instructions were received in Madinah, Waleed bin
Utba called the influential people of Madinah and read Yazid's
letter to them. Imam Husain ~ 11 ~ J heard of Amir Muawiya's
death and expressed his sense of grief and prayed for his
forgiveness and asked Waleed not to make haste in taking his bay'at
for Yazid. "I shall think it over and then decide." Marwan bin
Hakam, the former governor of Madinah and advisor to Wale.ed bin
Utba, encouraged Waleed to take Imam Husain's ba'it then and
there and not to let him go. But Waleed did not agree with
Marwan's counsel and postponed it to the next day.
Abdullah bin Zubair = .1>1._,;,J did not come to take bay'at for Yazid. He
was called but he refused to come and asked to be granted time for
one night. Waleed allowed him. Finding the situation compelling he,
along with his family, departed from Madinah and leaving the main
road, he set out along a little known path. The next day Marwan and
Waleed took thirty armed persons with them and went to arrest ibn
Zubair. But they did not find any trace of him. They returned in the
evening because the whole day was spent in searching for ibn Zubair
.._;... 11 <..F" J, no one thought of Imam Husain ~ 11 <..F" J· The next night
Imam Husain along with his family also left Madinah. The next day
when the news of Imam Husain's flight broke out, Waleed said, "I
shall not chase Imam Husain. It is possible that he might take up arms
and then I might have to stain my hands with his blood which I do not
want to do at any cost." Waleed, after the departure of these two
persons, took ba'it of the people of Madinah for Yazid, there was no
danger from Abdullah bin Umar ~ 11 <..F" J because he never wished to
be caliph. Yazid also issued instructions that if Abdullah bin Umar
~ 11 <..F" J refused to take bay' at he should not be forced. Therefore, no
one asked him to take the bay'at.
Abdullah bin Umar and Abdullah bin Abbas ~ .1>1 ~ J went to
Makkah after a few days. Yazid had already sent Harith as an official
to Makkah.

58

The History of Islam

Abdullah bin Zubair and Husain bin Ali 1...p .'i.1 <? J entered Makkah at
the same time. Immediately after seeing him Abdullah bin Safwan bin
Umayya who was among the nobles of Makkah, took bay'at at his
hands. Then about two thousand noble men and the influential people
of Makkah followed suit by taking bay'at at Abdullah bin Zubair's
hands. Abdullah bin Zubair '-"' .'i.1 ,.?J put Harith under house arrest
and took over the rule of Makkah. Imam Husain= .'i.1 ,.?J was also
present in Makkah. He neither took ba'it for Zubair's nor did Zubair
~ .'i.1 ~ J take bay'at for Imam Husain nor did he want to take ba'it
from any of the members of his family . When Abdullah bin Umar ,.?J
~ .'i.1 and Abdullah bin Abbas = .'i.1 <? J visited Makkah, Abdullah bin
Zubair did not wish them to take ba'it from him. Abdullah bin Zubair
= 11 ,.?J spent most of his time praying at the Ka'bah. Except for these
few persons, the whole of Makkah took ba'it for him.
Abdullah bin Zubair ~ .'i.1 ,.,,..---:,,J often met Imam Husain= 11,.?J and
consulted him. It seems that Abdullah bin Zubair = .'i.1 ,.?J did not take
bay'at from · the people for the caliphate but took bay'at with the
intention that Yazid should not be accepted as caliph and as long as
the caliph was not selected unanimously by the Islamic world, he
should be recognized as the governor of Makkah to maintain law and
order. But Imam Husain ~ .'i.1 ~ J did not appreciate Abdullah bin
Zubair ~ .'i.1 ,.?J being in power in Makkah so he and the members of
his family did not join him when he led the prayer.
Following these events, Marwan wrote to Yazid about how Abdullah
bin Zubair and Husain bin Ali 1...p .'i.1 ,.?J left Madinah and that the
people of Madinah took ba'it. Yazid at once removed Waleed bin Utba
and sent Amr bin Sayeed bin Aas as the governor of Madinah. Amr
bin Sayeed came and took control of the government of Madinah.
Waleed bin Utba left Madinah and went to Yazid.
Harith bin Khalid was present in Makkah and did not venture out of
his house, he sent Yazid the details concerning the capture of Makkah
by Abdullah bin Zubair ~ .'i.1 ,.,,..---:,,J and his own captivity. Becoming
aware of the conditions prevailing in Makkah Yazid wrote to Amr bin
Sayeed: "Go to Makkah and arrest Abdullah bin Zubair and send him
to me in chains." Amr bin Sayeed sent a strong army to Makkah.
There was a confrontation and Abdullah bin Zubair ~ .'i.1 ,.?J was

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

59

victorious. The commander of the Madinah army was caught and
imprisoned.
The inhabitants of Kufa, since the time of Amir Muawiya= 11<?J
used to write to Imam Husain= 11 <? J repeatedly to visit Kufa where
they would take ba'it for his caliphate. Amir Muawiya= 11 <?J knew
more about the nature and habits of the people of Kufa, and at the
time of his death, told Yazid as part of his last testament not to be
cheated by them. Amir Muawiya ~ 11 <?J also told Yazid that the
inhabitants of Kufa would certainly encourage Imam Husain= 11 <?J
to rebel. If such a situation arose and he got the better of Imam
Husain, he should treat him respectfully and leniently. Since Makkah
was under the control of Abdullah bin Zubair, Imam Husain's
thoughts were concentrated on Kufa. When Noman bin Bashir, the
governor of Kufa, received Yazid's letter and the news of Amir
Muawiya's death spread, the supporters of Banu Umayyad took ba'it
with Noman bin Bashir for Yazid. But the supporters and followers of
Ali = 11 <?J and Husain= 11 <?J, who had been trying to bring Husain
~ 11 ~ ; to Kufa, hesitated in taking ba'it for Yazid and collected at
Sulaiman bin Sard's house. All agreed that Yazid should not be
recognized as caliph and Imam Husain = 11 <? J should be brought to
Kufa. While the secret consultation was going on, they heard that
Imam Husain = 11 <? J left Madinah and that the Makkan had selected
Abdullah bin Zubair ~ 11 <?J instead of Imam Husain= 11 <?J and
that Imam Husain '----"' 11 <?J had arrived in Makkah and furthermore
that he had not taken ba'it for Abdullah bin Zubair. Therefore, they
sent a letter to Imam Husain= 11 <?J stating:
"We are your father's admirers and enemies of Banu Umayyah.
We fought Talha = 11 <?J and Zubair-= 11<?J in support of your
father. We created havoc in the battle of Siffin and made the
Syrians acknowledge our superiority in valor. Now we are
prepared to fight along with you also. Please leave for Kufa as
soon as you read this letter. Come here so that we might kill
Noman bin Bashir and hand over Kufa to you. One hundred
thousand fighters are present in Kufa and all of them are ready
to take bay'at for your caliphate. We believe trat you are the
rightful and worthy caliph. Yazid does not deserve to be caliph

60

The History of Islam
in comparison with you. This is the time. Do not delay in the
least. We want to make you caliph of the entire Islamic world
by killing Yazid. Our elders have even stopped standing in
prayer behind Yazid's official, Noman bin Bashir because we
think you and your deputies to be worthy of the lmamat (Islamic
leadership)."

When letters with similar contents started reaching Imam Husain <?J
.:ill in quick succession in Makkah, he called his cousin Muslim bin
Aqil, whose father Aqil bin Abi Talib was one of Amir Muawiya's
chief associates and advisors, and said to him:
'---'S-

Please go to Kufa secretly as my deputy. Live there privately, among
the people of Kufa and take ba'it from them on my behalf secretly.
Write to me the number and a few of the important names of those
who take bay' at for me. Try to keep yourself concealed, and encourage
those who . take bay'at for me, and do not to start fight unless I am
present.
Muslim bin Aqil, taking all precautions that Abdullah bin Zubair <? J
.:u1 should not become aware of his movements, left Makkah. He
thought a little on the way and wrote to Imam Husain= .:u1 <?J: "I do
not visualize that the consequences of these actions will be good.
Please excuse me and send somebody else to Kufa in my place." Imam
Husain ~ 11 ...,-:,,J wrote back to him, "Do not be a coward. You alone
must go to Kufa." Muslim bin Aqil therefore continued to Kufa and in
Kufa he stayed at Mukhtar bin Obeida's house. At once, the news
spread among the follower's of Ali the group after group began to
arrive and take ba'it. Muslim bin Aqil wrote to Imam Husain= .1.>1 <?J
that he reached Kufa safely and how on the first day twelve thousand
people took ba'it. On the very first day including 12,000 people Sultan
bin Sard, Musaiyeb bin Najia, Raqata bin Shaddad, Hani bin Urwah
took ba'it for Husain bin Ali= .:u1 <?J. Two persons named Qais and
Abdur Rahman reached Imam Husain = .1.>1 <?J with a letter stating:
"When you come and start taking ba'it openly, hundreds of thousands
of people will take ba'it for your caliphate." Imam Husain= .1.>1 <?J
was very pleased to read this letter and immediately sent back the
bearers of the letter with word that he would be coming to Kufa very
soon. Now Imam Husain '---'S- .:i11..,--;,J thinking that a good number of
'---'S-

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

61

supporters of Ali = .'i.1 ,.?J lived in Basra, sent a confidant of his with a
letter to Ahnaf bin Malik and letters to the nobles of Basra, stating that
they should take ba'it and proceed to Kufa at once.
When the news of Muslim bin Aqil's arrival in Kufa and people taking
ba'it spread, Abdullah bin Muslim Al-Hadharmi called on Noman bin
Bashir and said to him, 0 Amir! You should not show slackness in the
caliph's affairs. Several days have passed since Muslim bin Aqil arrived
in Kufa and he has been taking bay'at for the Caliphate of Imam
Husain '----CS- .'i.1 ~ J · You should kill Muslim bin Aqil or arrest him and
send him to Yazid and punish those who have taken ba'it." Noman
bin Bashir= .'i.1 ,.?J said, "I do not want to expose the work which they
are doing secretly. I shall not attack them unless they come out for a
fight." Hearing this Abdullah wrote the following letter to Yazid.
Muslim bin Aqil '----CS- .'i.1 ~ J has arrived in Kufa and has been
taking ba'it for the caliphate of Husain bin Ali= .'i.1 ,.?J and the
people have been responding favorably. Husain bin Ali= .'i.1 ,.?J
is also expected to come. Noman bin Bashir is showing
weakness in this affair. If you want to keep Kufa under your
control, send some strict governor to Kufa so that he might slay
Muslim bin Aqil and suppress the ba'it and stop Husain bin Ali
'----CS- .'i.1 ~
J from entering Kufa. If you delay, then deem Kufa to
have gone out of your control.
Ammara bin Oqba bin Abi Moeet also sent a letter to Yazid of similar
content. These letters made him thoughtful and disturbed him very
much. There was a man named Sarjoon who was a liberated slave of
Amir Muawiya "----CS-.'i,1 ~ J- Amir Muawiya = .'i.1 ,.?J used to seek his
counsel on some complicated and important affairs to his great
advantage. Yazid called him, and showing him Abdullah bin AlHadhrasmis letter he sought his opinion. Here at this point, as a
parenthesis it is worth mentioning that Yazid had always been
displeased with Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan. After Zeyad, he resented and
hated Obaidullah bin Zeyad. Amir Muawiya '----..,.;.;. .'i.1 ~ J made
Obaidullah bin Zeyad the governor of Basra. Yazid was thinking of
removing him from that post and installing somebody else instead.
When the horrible news from Kufa came, Yazid consulted Amir
Muawiya's liberated slave, he said:

62

The History of Islam

"At this moment, Iraq is about to go out of your hands. If you want to
save Iraq, none other than Obaidullah bin Zeyad can help you. I know
that you will dislike my counsel. But who ever other than Obaidullah
bin Zeyad you send to Kufa as governor, he will not be able to save it.
Furthermore, just as Amir Muawiya ~ 11 ~ ) had assigned the
governorship of both Basra and Kufa together similarly you should
also assign him the dual charge and you need not select any other
governor for Basra."
Yazid hesitated a moment after hearing this advice, and then wrote
instructions to Obaidullah bin Zeyad.
"I hereby assign you the governorship of Kufa along with that
of Basra. You should leave someone as your deputy in Basra
and go to Kufa at once Muslim bin Aqil has been there taking
ba'it for Imam Husain= 11 t.?J· Make him a captive or kill him
and if those who took ba'it from him, refuse to recant their ba'it
they should be put to death and by this way we will ward off all
further dangers."
Obaidullah bin Zeyad was sure that Yazid was going to remove him
from the governorship of Basra. He was surprised to read the contents
of the letter. He was pleased as well as wary because that order
obviously indicated a danger that Yazid might be trying to get him
out of Basra by this pretext. Yet, he thought it necessary to obey the
order. He made up his mind to leave his brother Uthman bin Zeyad in
his place in Basra and he set out for Kufa the next day. Meanwhile
Mundhir bin Al-Harith came running to him saying that Husain bin
Ali's messenger had come and had been taking ba'it for Imam Husain
'--'>-11~ J and was doing it secretly. Obaidullah bin Zeyad through
deception arrested Imam Husain's messenger and the next day
collected the people and made this speech.
Husain bin Ali's emissary has come to Basra with his letters to a
number of people here. I have arrested them. I have extracted the
names of those people here who have received these letters and I have
also prepared a list of those who have taken ba'it for Imam Husain t.?J
.= 11. You know I am Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan's son. Muslim bin Aqil t.?J
= 11 is in Kufa. I am going to him. I shall kill all those have taken ba'it

63

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

at his hands. If the whole of Kufa has entered into his ba'it, I shall
spare none. At this moment, I make a concession to you that except for
Husain bin Ali's emissary, I will not say anything to anybody. But if
anyone speaks anything after I have left, it will not be good for him.
Saying this he brought Imam Husain's messenger and killed him in
front of them all. No one made a sign indicative of disapproval.
Satisfied with this act, he went to Kufa. Imam Husain-.... 11 ,.?j sitting
in Makkah thought that the people were taking ba'it for him in Basra
but instead his messenger was actually being killed. Obaidullah bin
Zeyad reached Qadisya and left his cavalry there, and along with his
father's liberated slave rode a camel and rushed to Kufa and entered it
in between Maghrib and Isha time. He purposely put on a turban like
the people of the Hijaz. In the mean time, the people wer~ waiting for
the arrival of Imam Husain -.... 11 ,.? j · The dominance of the followers
of Ali and Husain were too great and Noman bin Bashir locked the
doors of his court on that same evening, he sat with a selected few of
those close to him and posted slaves at the door with instructions to
first ask any visitor's name and address and if they deserved entry,
they should be let in, if not, they should be refused. When Obaidullah
bin Zeyad entered Kufa, the people thought that the man for whom
they were waiting for, Imam Husain ~ 11 ,.?j had arrived in Kufa.
Wherever Obaidullah's camel passed by, the people they said: "Peace
be upon you, 0 son of the Prophet r-1--) ""-# .;;,1 J-,,." Obaidullah reached
the court on his camel. He found the door closed. He knocked at the

roof with his friends . He rose and coming to the edge of the roof,
looked down. As the entire city was awaiting Imam Husain= 11 ,.?j,
he also mistook Obaidullah to be Imam Husain= 11<?j· He said, "O
son of the Prophet r-1--) ""-# 11 J-,,! Please go back and don't create an evil
disorder. Yazid will never hand over Kufa to you." Noman's friends
who were sitting on the roof said to him, "Please don 't be impolite to
Imam Husain -= 11<?j· At least open the door and let him in because
he is coming from a journey directly to you as your guest." Noman bin
Bashir said, "I do not like to give the people any chance to say that
during Noman's regime Imam Husain was slain in Kufa." Obaidullah
took off his turban and said, "O unfortunate one! Open the door at
least." Hearing Obaidullah's voice, they at once recognized him. They
~j

64

The History of Islam

opened the door and then dispersed. He entered and after some time,
his army, which he had left behind, started entering Kufa. At the same
time, Muslim bin Aqil ~ 11 ~ ; was informed of the arrival of
Obaidullah bin Zeyad's army. He left the house where he had been
staying, which was known to the people, and took refuge in Hani bin
Urwa's house. By that time, the number of people who had taken ba'it
at his hands in Kufa, had reached eighteen thousand. The next
morning Obaidullah bin Zeyad spoke to the crowd and read Yazid 's
orders that came from Basra. Obaidullah said:
"My father is well known to you and also the style of politics that he
used to practice. All his features are present in me. You know me also
and I fully know the names, houses and freed slaves of each of you.
You cannot hide anything from me. I don't like to shed blood in Kufa
and kill you. I know that you have taken bay'at for Husain bin Ali..?.)
~ .'iii at Muslim bin Aqil's hands. I give protection to all of you
provided you recant your ba'it and don't give shelter to those who are
bent upon revolting otherwise every giver of shelter will be killed at
his own door."
After this speech, Obaidullah asked about Muslim bin Aqil's
whereabouts. No one answered. At last he was informed by his spies
that he was hiding in Hani bin Urawa's house. Obaidullah gave a
purse of three thousand dirhams to Maqal, a liberated slave of the
Tamim tribe and and was unknown to anynone in Kufa, and told him
to call at Hani bin Urwa's house and tell him, "I have to tell you
something in private" and when in private tell him: "Such and such
person of Basra has sent me to you and has given me three thousand
dirhams to give to Muslim bin Aqil in Kufa and tell him that I have
received a letter from Imam Husain from Makkah which asked me to
go to Kufa on such and such date and that on that same date Imam
Husain ~ 11 ~ .) would also reach Kufa. Don't worry we shall enter
Kufa along with Imam Husain = 11 ..?.) and take this three thousand
dirhams as a gift from us for your needs. So, please take me to Muslim
bin Aqil so that I may give all these messages and this money to him
and leave Kufa at once because Obaidullah bin Zeyad has arrived and
as he knows me, I am in danger of being arrested" .
Maqal took this purse and called on Hani. He was sitting at his door.

65

Hearing his message, he took him to Muslim bin Aqil. Muslim bin
Aqil was glad to receive the purse and hearing the message saw
Maqal off. Maqal came direct back to Obaidullah and told him that he
had given the purse to Muslim bin Aqil and that he had talked to him.
He was present in Hani's house. Obaidullah bin Zeyad called Hani
and inquired about Muslim bin Aqil's whereabouts. He called Maqal
and made him repeat his statement in front of everybody. Hani was
ashamed and said,
"Yes, Muslim bin Aqil has taken refuge with me but I cannot bear the
insult of handing him over to you".
Obaidullah arrested Hani then and there. The news spread in the city
that Obaidullah killed Hani. Hani' s women folk started lamenting.
When Muslim bin Aqil witnessed all of this, he could bear it no more,
he came out with sword in hand and he called all those who had taken
bay'at at his hands. Only four thousand people out of eighteen
thousand collected. He called the rest also but each of them answered.
"At the time of ba'it it was agreed that we would not fight until Imam
Husain ~ .1i1 ~ j arrived. You should also wait and watch until he
comes." As Muslim bin Aqil came out, he could not go back into
hiding again. He surrounded Obaidullah bin Zeyad with the four
thousand people who responded to his call. ObaiduJlah bin Zeyad
was at the governor's headquarters with thirty or forty people. They
climbed on the roof and started showering arrows on those
surrounding the place. The relatives and friends of Muslim bin Aqil's
supporters began to persuade them to desist from their selfdestruction. In short, all of them parted little by little until only thirty
or forty supporters remained with Muslim bin Aqil.

Muslim bin Aqil = 11 c?j in this situation fled from the place and took
refuge in someone's house in Kufa. Obaidullah bin Zeyad sent Amr

"----'-" .1,1 c?j drew out his sword. But Amr bin Jarir said to him, "Why do
you ruin your life unnecessarily? Just surrender yourself to me and at
my own risk, I will take you to Obaidullah bin Zeyad and promise
that I shall get you pardoned." Muslim bin Aqil = 11 c?j laid down the

sword and put his hands into those of Amr. He took him to
Obaidullah. Obaidullah imprisoned him in the same room in which he
had imprisoned Hani bin Urwa. The next day about ten thousand
people who had taken bay'at collected and surrounded Obaidullah bin
Zeyad' s house. They demanded that Muslim bin Aqil and Hani bin
Urwa should be released willingly otherwise, they would snatch them
away by force. Obaidullah bin Zeyad ordered them to be taken to the
roof and executed before their eyes. Both were therefore killed. Seeing
the execution all of them dispersed as if they had only come for the
purpose of getting their leaders killed. Obaidullah ordered the gate of
the palace to be opened, their bodies were hung on a stake and their
heads were carried off to Yazid in Damascus. Yazid wrote to Obaidullah

everything was ready and the news spread that he was going to Kufa,
all those who had love and sympathy with him came and insisted on
his giving up his intention and tried to make him understand that
leaving for Kufa was not free from danger. First Abdur Rahman bin
Harith came and requested him not to go to Kufa because the
governor of Iraq, Obaidullah bin Zeyad was present there. The
inhabitants of Kufa are greedy and it is just possible that those who
called you might come out to fight against you. Abdullah bin Umar
~ .\.,1-.?J came and said to him, "Don't go out of Makkah to take ba'it
and leadership, Allah gave the Holy Prophet r-1-,- J ..,i., .\.,1 J.., the option to
select either this world or the Hereafter. He chose the Hereafter. You
also belong to the family of the Prophet r-1--., ..,i., 11J..,. Don' t yearn after
this world. Don't let yourself be contaminated with worldly filth."
Having exhorted thus Abdullah bin Umar = .\.,1 -.?J burst into tears.
Imam Husain = 11-.?J also began to weep but refused to act upon his
advice. Being helpless Abdullah bin Umar = .\.,1 -.?J parted from him.
Then Abdullah bin Abbas= .\.,1-.?J said to him,
"Don't leave Makkah. Don't be away from the House of Allah. Your

respected father preferred Kufa to Makkah and Madinah but don't
you know how the inhabitants of Kufa treated him? They martyred
him. They robbed your brother Hasan ~ .'ii, ~ J and ultimately
poisoned him to death. You must not rely on them. Neither their bay'at
nor their promise is believable nor are their letters and messages
trustworthy." Hearing this Imam Husain '--'->- .'ii, ._..;,J said, "You are a
hundred percent justified in what you say. But Muslim bin Aqil's
letter has come. Twelve thousand people have taken ba'it. Before that
one hundred and fifty letters from the noblemen of Kufa have also
come. Now there is no danger. My visit to that place is the right
·thing." Hearing this Abdullah bin Abbas-= ..111 ._..;,J said," All right, at
least let this month of Dhul Hijja end and the new year begin and then
think of undertaking the journey. Now the season of Hajj is
approaching and people from a far are coming to Makkah, and you
are leaving Makkah and going out only for the sake of ruling over the
worldly people and bringing into your possession the fortunes of the
world. It is proper for you to participate in the Hajj and let the people
return after performing Hajj, and even after that if you think it
necessary, then you may set out." Imam Husain= ..111 ._..;,J said, ''The
issue is such as I cannot defer it. I must set out at once." Abdullah bin
Abbas '--'->-1, ._..;,J said, "Well, if you don't agree with me, at least don' t
take the women and children with you because the inhabitants of
Kufa are absolutely unreliable. It was the duty of the twelve thousand
people who have taken ba'it for your Caliphate to have first turned
Yazid's administrator out of Kufa, taken the treasury in their
possession and then called you. But in the present situation, it seems
that they are incapable of doing anything against Yazid's
administrator in Kufa. Now as they have neither the treasury nor the
courage to drive the administrator out, this administrator might
frighten or tempt them and use them according to his own will, and it
is just possible that these people who are calling you, might jump onto
the battlefield on Yazid's side to fight against you. Considered from
this angle your life seems to be in danger. If women and children are
also with you, then, just as Uthman bin Affan = .'ii, ._..;,J was slain under
the very eyes of the members of his family similarly your family will
also have to witness you being murdered and there is apprehension of
their becoming slaves and slave girls after being arrested by your

enemies." When Imam Husain = 11-?; did not accept his advice, he
said, "If you are so much interested in leadership and the caliphate,
first go to Yemen. Your sympathizers also live there in good number.
The chain of mountains can also be of great help in your protection. If
you want the kingdom of Hijaz, you can get it very easily." At last,
Abdullah bin Abbas .:.s-11 -?J became quite helpless and Imam Husain
<-..:.S-11 ~ J did not accept even a single piece of his advice. Then
Abdullah bin Zubair came and said to him, "Don't try to go to Kufa.
Ever since your intention to visit Kufa has spread in Makkah, I have
been hearing some people say that Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 -?J will
be very glad if Husain bin Ali = 11 -?; leaves because there would
remain no rival in Makkah. I therefore, and in order to prove such
misguided people wrong, request you with all sincerely to accept the
kingdom of Makkah and out-stretch your hands so that I may take
ba'it on them and go out into the battlefield to fight in obedience to
your command." Imam Husain said, "Now I have informed them and
have made up my mind to leave. I cannot postpone it any longer."
On the 3rd of Dhul Hijja 60 A.H. Munday, Imam Husain= 11 -?J
along with the members of his family left Makkah. On the same day
Muslim bin Aqil = 11 -?J was slain in Kufa. When Imam Husain 11-?J
'-'-S- was leaving Makkah, Amr bin Sad bin Al-Aas .:.s- 11-?J and other
noblemen of Makkah came and wanted to stop him. They said, "If you
do not agree, we will stop you by force and face you." Imam Husain
~ 11~
J said, "Do whatever is in your power to do and fulfill your
wish of fighting with me also." Hearing this all of them opened the
way and left. At the time of departure Abdullah bin Abbas= 11-?J
said to him, "I would have lain down before your camel so that it
could not go ahead without trampling upon me. But I know that you
will not stop even then and desist from the intention of going there."
After he left Makkah, they met a caravan at Tan'lem, which was
taking gifts to Yazid from the administrator of Yemen. He stopped
that caravan and took some goods from it and moved on. In between
Makkah and Kufa at Safah, he came across Farzdaq, the well-known
Arabic poet, who was coming from Kufa. When Farzdaq left Kufa,
Obaidullah bin Zeyad had not yet entered it. When Imam Husain ~ J
= 1, made queries about the people of Kufa, he said, "Their hearts are
with you but their swords cannot be flags in your support." He had

Caliphate of Banu Urnayyah (First Phase)

69

not gone far when Abdullah bin Jafar's letter, sent through his sons
Aun and Mohammad from Madinah, reached him in which he
requested him, in the name of Allah, to desist from going to Kufa and
come to Madinah instead because he apprehended danger to his life
and because of this he must not be hasty in the matter. The messenger
also handed over to him the letter from the governor of Madinah that
said that if he wished to go to Madinah and settle there, he would be
given all protection. But Imam Husain u- 11 ._?J absolutely refused to
return. He took Mohammad and Aun along with him and asked the
escort, an inhabitant of Basra, to bring him to Kufa as soon as possible,
so that he might enter the city before Obaidullah bin Zeyad's arrival
there and because the people there were anxiously waiting his arrival.
By chance on the same day Yazid's letter was also received by
Obaidullah bin Zeyad asking him to protect himself and depute
armed forces on every road and path because Imam Husain u- 11 ._?J
might be moving towards him and that he should be stopped from
reaching Kufa. Imam Husain = 11 ._?Jon the other hand, went ahead
thinking that people were taking ba'it at Muslim bin Aqil's hands
everyday and the group supporting him would be getting bigger. But
the reality was that in Kufa Obaidullah bin Zeyad was busy selecting
armed personnel for his arrest or execution. After a few days journey
he met Abdullah bin Mu tie. Finding out his intention, he insisted to
stop Imam Husain= 11 ._?J from executing his plan and tried to make
him swear to turn back to Makkah. He tried to make him understand
that he should not be deceived by the Iraqis because if he wanted to
take the caliphate from Banu Umayya, they would instantly kill him
and feel encouraged in killing every Hashmite every Arab and every
Muslim who supported him, and by destroying himself, he could
dishonor Islam, the Arabs and the Quraish. But his speech was
ignored by Imam Husain ~ 11 ..?) and he continued his journey to
Kufa. From Hajr through Qais bin Mishar he sent a letter to the people
of Kufa that he had reached near and that they should continue to
wait for him. As soon as Qais reached Qadisiya, he was arrested by
ibn Zeyad's soldiers. He was taken to him with the letter. He had him
taken up to the roof of the palace of the Amir and thrown down. Qais
died on the spot. Again, from the next stage of his journey, he sent his
foster brother Abdullah bin Yaqtur, with a letter. He also met the same

70

fate. When that caravan reached Salba, they found out that Muslim
bin Aqil ....__;.s. .'iii ..,;,1 had been killed in Kufa, and that not even a single
supporter of Imam Husain= 11._?.1 was left in Kufa . That news threw
a pall of gloom over the entire caravan and it intended to retrace its
steps because in moving towards Kufa there was strong probability
that the caravan would meet the same fate which Muslim bin Aqil had
met. Hearing this Muslim bin Aqil's sons said, "We must not go back.
We will avenge Muslim bin Aqil's murder or we will die as he died.
Secondly, Husain bin Ali= 11..,;,1 is not like Muslim bin Aqil = .iii1..,;,1 .
When the people of Kufa see him, they will accompany him and arrest
Ibn Zeyad." Several honored people were with the caravan and had
joined it on the journey, they kept multiplying at each stage. However,
after the news moved through the caravan the people of the tribes began
slowly and gradually to take leave until only the members of Husain
bin Ali's family and tribe were left. They were said to number seventy
or eighty by some sources and about two hundred and fifty by other
authorities.

The Disaster at Karbala
Obaidullah bin Zeyad named Amr bin Sad bin Abi Waqas the
governor of Rayy and gave him four thousand soldiers to keep watch
on all paths and roads into Kufa and to find out by which route
Husain bin Ali = .'iii ._?.1 was coming and where was he camping. He
also gave Hur bin Yazid Tamimi one thousand soldiers and put him
on patrol. Amr bin Sad started collecting information of different
sources while he was camped at Qadisiya. Husain bin Ali= .'iii ..,;,1 was
in a dilemma and in that state, he reached Saraf. When he moved
forward, Hur blocked him with his one thousand soldiers. Imam
Husain ....__;.s. .\ii ..,;, 1 went forward and said to him, "I have come here at
your call. If you stick to your pledge, I will enter the city otherwise I
shall go the way by which I have come." Hur said, "I have been
ordered by Obaidullah bin Zeyad to.stay with you and take you to
him in our custody." Husain= 11 ._?.1 said, "It is impossible to bear the
humiliation of going to him in custody." He then wanted to go back.
Hur, out of fear of lbn Zeyad, wanted to stop him and stood with his
army on the way of his retreat. Imam Husain = .i1_,.;, 1 moved to north

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

71

and reached Qadisiya . He became aware that Amr bin Sad, along with
a large army, was camping there. Hur followed Husain bin Ali .11 0')
'--'->- . Following this discovery, Imam Husain= .110'J left Qadisiya and
after covering ten miles halted at Karbala. Amr bin Sad was informed
of his arrival and set out with his army and following him arrived at
Karbala. After camping in same vicinity Amr bin Sad left his army
and came toward Imam Husain's camp and called for him. After
exchanging greetings, lbn Sad said,
"Undoubtedly, you deserve the caliphate more than Yazid does but it
is not the intention of Allah to let both prophethood and caliphate
come into your family. You have seen the circumstances and
conditions of Ali bin Abi Talib= .110') and Hasan bin Ali= .11 0')· If
you give up the thought of this sultanate and rule, you can easily
become free otherwise your life will be in jeopardy and we have been
ordered to arrest you."
Imam Husain= .110') said,
"I put three alternatives before you, you may choose any of them for
me.
1. Let me go the way I came so that I may remain absorbed in prayer

in Makkah.
2. Let me move to any border so that I may be martyred while
fighting with the unbelievers.
3. Leave my way free and let me go to Yazid in Damascus. For your
satisfaction, you may follow me. I shall go to Yazid and settle my
affairs directly with him as my elder brother Imam Hasan= .11 0')
did with Amir Muawiya.
Amr bin Sad was very pleased to hear what he said and replied that
he was not in a position to give him the final reply in this matter. He
further said that he would inform Obaidullah bin Zeyad at once, and
he was sure that he would agree to any of the three points. Amr bin
Sad was camped on the same plain he wrote to Ibn Zeyad a detailed
account of the meeting, this took place on Muharram 2, 61 A.H.
Obaidullah bin Zeyad was overjoyed reading Amr bin Sad's letter. He
said, "Imam Husain = .110'J has spoken in a way that will put a stop

The History of Islam

72

to all evil disorders and by going to Yazid he will take ba'it (the oath
of allegiance), and then there will be no longer any danger." Shimr
Dhul Jaushan was p.r,esent there at the time. He said, 0 Amir! You
have an opportunity now. You may kill the Imam without hesitation.
No one will blame you. However, if he goes to Yazid, you will no
longer be honored and respected in comparison to him and he will be
able to enjoy a greater status than you."
11

When Ibn Zeyad heard this, he wrote to Amr bin Sad.
11

All these three alternatives cannot be accepted. The one thing
acceptable is: let Imam Husain= 11 ,.?J surrender before me and
take the oath of allegiance for Yazid at my hands as his deputy
and then I shall send him to Yazid on my own."
On the receipt of this reply, Amr bin Sad informed Imam Husain 11 .,i"J
~ that he was helpless and said that Ibn Zeyad first wanted ba'it at
his hands and did not agree to any other proposal. Imam Husain 11..r"J
4--'->- replied that it was better for him
to die than take bay'at on Ibn
Ziyad's hand .
Ibn Sad was trying his best to avoid bloodshed. H e wanted that either
Imam Husain <.-'S- 1, ._,,....;,) should accept Ibn Zeyad's conditions or Ibn
Zeyad should let him go according to his wish. During the week long
correspondences of refusal and insistence both Imam Husain= 1, .,i"J
and Ibn Sad along with their men, remained camped on the field of
Karbala. Imam Husain's men made their prayers with lbn Sad' s
soldiers and Imam Husain= 11 ,.?J used to straighten the Saf (the rows
of those praying) . When Ibn Zeyad was informed of this, he became
worried Ibn Sad might conspire with Imam Husain= 11._?;.Heat
once called in a herald named Jowira bin Tamimi and gave him a
letter for lbn Sad:
I ordered you to arrest Husain bin Ali = 11 ,.? ;- It was your
duty to have arrested him and brought him to me. If you were
unable to do so, you should have brought his head to me. I did
not order you to join his company and promote friendly
relations with him. Now it is better for you that immediately
after reading this letter and without any hesitation either bring
Husain bin Ali= 11,.?J to me or fight with him, cut off his head
11

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

73

and send it to me. If you hesitate even a little, then the bearer of
this letter, who is a military officer, has been ordered to arrest
you and bring you to me while the army should remain camped
there and wait for the next commander whom I shall send in
your place."
Taking the letter Jowira reached Ibn Sad on Thursday Muharram 9, 61
A.H. Ibn Sad was sitting in his camp at that time. As soon as he read
the letter, he stood up, mounted on his horse and ordered his army to
get ready and said to Jowira, " Bear witness that as soon as I have read
the Amir's order, I have complied with it." Then he set the rows of
soldiers and taking Jowira along moved forward. He sent for Imam
Husain -= :.1..,.-:,,J and acquainted him with the contents of the letter and
the herald. Imam Husain -= :.1..,.-:,,J asked him to grant one days' time.
Ibn Sad looked towards Jowira who said that the next day was not far and
that he should be granted the time. Ibn Sad returned from the field
and ordered the soldiers to relax because there would not be any
fighting on that day.
After sending his order through Jowira, Obaidullah bin Zeyad
thought that if Ibn Sad showed slackness and Jowira made him
captive the army would become bewildered and scattered without
their commander and just possibly they might join Imam Husain 11 ..,.-:,,J
=. In that case, it would be very a difficult situation and Imam Husain
~ 11~
J would have time to escape to Makkah and get out of their
reach. He at once called Shimr Dhul Jaushan to him and said I have
sent Jowira with the order that if Ibn Sad hesitated, he should be
arrested and brought to me. I suspect him to be a hypocrite. If Jowira
arrests Ibn Sad, the army will be in the field without a leader and may
falter and be lost. I can't find anybody else better than you for this
task. Go to KarbaJa and if lbn Sad is arrested, take command of the
army, fight with Imam Husain-= .'i,1 ..,.-:,,.; and cut of his head and bring
it to me. If Ibn Sad is not arrested and is hesitant in fighting, go and
start it and finish the work at once." Shimr said to him, "I have a
condition. You know that my sister Umm Lambeen bint Haram was
Ali's wife who bore him four sons named Obaidullah, Jafar, Uthman,
and Abbas. They are present on the plain of Karbala along with their
brother Husain= .'i,1 ..,.-:,,J. Give me protection for their lives. Obaidullah

bin Zeyad at once had a paper brought to him and wrote Aman pardon and safety, sealed it and gave it to Shimr and sent him off.
Jowira left at night and early on Thursday morning reached the army
at Karbala. Shimr left in the morning and reached at Asr time (late
afternoon). He briefed him with all that occurred. Shimr said, "I
would not have granted him even a single moment. Either get ready
at once or hand over the army to me." lbn Sad sat on the horse and
taking Shimr with him, went to Imam Husain = .'iii <? J and told him
that Obaidullah bin Zeyad had sent another messenger and that he
was not ready to grant him any delay in the battle. Imam Husain .'iii <?J
~ said, "Subhan Allah, What is the necessity of granting me time
now? The sun is setting. Won't you defer the fight to tomorrow?"
Hearing that Shimr thought it proper to wait until the next morning
and both returned to their camps.

Water Banned
At night Obaidullah's order reached that if the fight had not started as
yet the water sources must be captured and prohibited for Husain bin Ali
= .'iii <?J and his companions immediately after the receipt of the order.
If the army had come under Shimr' s command, the latter should
comply with it.
Amr bin Sad, immediately after receiving the order, assigned five
hundred horsemen to Amr bin Al-Hajjaj and stationed him near the
Euphrates. Imam Husain's companions had not brought and stored
water for themselves that day and all their containers were empty.
When they went to fill them up with water, they realized the enemy
had occupied the territory by the river. Imam Husain= .'iii <?J sent his
brother Abbas bin Ali '--"" .'ii, <?J along with fifty men to get water by
force . However, the tyrants did not let them take it. Now the agony
caused by the intensity of thirst started increasing. That agony was
more excruciating than arrows and swords could cause. Imam
Husain's young son Ali bin Husain (Zain al-Abedeen) was lying ill in
a tent when he and his sister Umm Kulthum, saw that the enemies
would attack them in the morning and all their present relatives
would be killed and martyred, they began to cry. Hearing them cry,
Imam Husain ~ 11 ._,--;,J entered the tent and told them that their

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

75

enemies were camping nearby and would be pleased to hear them cry
and the companions would feel discouraged and that they should not
lament. He silenced them only after a great effort and came out and
said that he was surely wrong in bringing children and women with
him and that they should not have been brought. Then he called all his
companions to him and said, "You may leave and go wherever you
think best. No one will hurt you because the enemies are concerned
with me. Your leaving would be a benefit for them. I allow you to save
your lives." His companions said, "We will never part with you. We
will sacrifice our lives for you and as long as we breathe, we will not
let any harm come to you."
Later that same night, a man named Tarmah bin Adi who was visiting
the vicinity and had heard about Imam Husain's plight said to him,
"Please come along with me alone. I shall take you along such a route
that no one will know you have left. I shall then take you to the Tribe
of Tai and give you five thousand soldiers from my tribe. You may
use them as you like." Imam Husain = ...'i,1 <.F'J said, "I have just told
them to leave me alone and go. They did not accept it. How is it
possible now to leave them alone and depart and save my life?" His
companions said, "As you have just said, they will not hurt us because
they are your enemies. For this reason, you must depart and save your
life. Imam Husain -.__:s. ...'i,1 ~ J said, I shall never go to save my life
without you ." He therefore sent off that man with thanks.
The next morning Shimr and Amr bin Sad came onto the field after
the marshalling of the troops in battle array. Imam Husain= ...'i,1 <.F'J
also issued the necessary instructions to his companions and assigned
them their positions. Shimr called Obaidullah, Jafar, Uthman and
Abbas onto the field and said to them, "Amir Ibn Zeyad has given you
protection." They said, "Allah's protection is better than that of
Zeyad' s." Shimr was left looking pathetic. According to some
traditions at the time when the battle started on the morning of
Muharram 10, 61 A. H. seventy-two people were present on the side of
Imam Husain ..._,_,. ...'i,1 <.F'J· Yet, other traditions fix them at one hundred
and forty and another at two hundred and forty. If we accept the
maximum number, two hundred and forty, even then Imam Husain's
companions were only a handful compared to the thousands of strong

The History of Islam

76

and well-armed soldiers of their enemies.
Imam Husain <-CS- .1, <?J set his companions in proper positions, gave
them the necessary instructions and mounted on a camel and went to
the troops of Kufa alone. He addressed them loudly and made a
speech to them,
"O people of Kufa! I know quite well that this speech will not yield
any results at this time and whatever you have to do, you will not
desist from doing it. But I think it necessary to end by a plea to all
for Allah's sake and my excuse should also be made clear to you."
He had hardly uttered these words when he heard the cries of
women and children rising from his tents. He was very sorry to hear
them. He interrupted his speech and said 'La haul ... ' (T!:!,ere is no
power except with Allah). He said, "Abdullah bin Abbas was
justified in asking me not to take women and children with me. I
committed a mistake when I did not agree with him." Then he went
back and shouted to his brothers and sons to stop the women from
crying and tell them to keep silent now and weep to their hearts
content tomorrow. They pacified them and the women and children
stopped crying. Imam Husain = .1, <? J again resumed his speech to the
soldiers of Kufa thus:
"O people! Let it be known to you who know me and also to
those of you who do not know me that I am the grandson of
Prophet ~ and the son of Ali bin Abi Talib= .1, <?J· Fatima bint
Prophet ~ was my mother and Jafar bin Abi Talib= .1, <?; was
my uncle. Besides this genealogical pride, I have also another
pride to my credit: that the Prophet ~ called me the chief of the
Youths of Paradise. If you do not believe me, you may have it
confirmed by a number of the Prophet's~ companions who are
still living. I never broke a promise, I never missed a Salat, I
neither killed a Muslim nor did harm to any one. If Jesus'
donkey was still alive, the whole of Christendom would be
busy feeding and taking care of it until the Day of Judgement.
What sort of Muslims and followers are you who want to kill
the grandson of your Prophet ~ ? You have neither the fear of
Allah nor are you ashamed on behalf of the Prophet ~- As I did
not kill anybody in my life, I do not deserve to be subjected to

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

77

retaliation. Tell me how have you concluded shedding my
blood to be lawful. Having retired from worldly pursuits and
disputes, I was staying in Madinah at the feet of the Prophet ~
but you did not let me live even there. I was then engaged in
Allah's worship in the House of Allah in Makkah. You people
of Kufa did not let me take rest there and continued sending
letters to me stating that you think me the rightful claimant to
the Imamate (leadership), and want to take ba' it for my
caliphate. When I responded to your call and came here, you
revolted against me. If you want to help me even now, I want
that you should not kill me and let me alone so that I may go
to Makkah or Madinah and become absorbed in prayer and
Allah will judge in this very world who was right and who
was wrong."
All kept silent on hearing the speech and no one answered. After
waiting some time Imam Husain -= .11 ,..? J said,
"Thank Allah I have pleaded with you and you could not offer any
response."
Then he called some of them by name, Shabt bin Rabi ya, Hajjaj bin AlHasan, Qais bin Al-Ashas, Hur bin Yazid Tamimi, and others! Did
you not write letters to me and call me insistently to this place and
now when I have arrived here, you are adamant on killing me."
When they heard that, they told him that they had neither written
letters to him nor called him. Imam Husain -w- .11 ,..?; took out their
letters and read them each separately, telling them these were their
letters. They replied that whether they wrote him letters or not, now
they were sick of him. After hearing that Imam Husain-= .11,..?; got off
his camel and got ready for the battle. Someone came out of the troops
from Kufa and onto the battlefield for single combat however, his
horse became so frightened that the fighter fell off and died. Seeing
that Hur bin Yazid Tamimi, posing as if he were attacking, put his
shield before him and came running on his horse to Imam Husain,..?;
= .11 and threw away his shield. When asked to explain the purpose of
his coming in this way, he said, "I am the man who kept you
surrounded and prevented your return and forced you to camp in this

78

The History of Islam

field. Now, in order to expiate my fault, I shall fight against the
soldiers of Kufa in your support. Please make a du'a (prayer) for my
forgiveness, Imam Husain 4...__:.<-11 ~) was highly pleased and made a
du' a, for him.
Shimr said to Amr bin Sad, "Why·do you delay now?" The latter at
once put an arrow into his bow and shot it towards Imam Husain's
= 11 ~) troops and said, "Bear witness that I have shot the first arrow.
Then two Kufan soldiers moved forward for single combat. From
Imam Husain's = 11 ~) side a brave man came out and killed both of
them. In this way, the combat continued and many of the soldiers
from Kufa were killed. Then from Imam Husain's side the men one
after another moved forward and started attacking their enemies
and many lost their lives. Imam Husain's= 11 ~) companions did
not let the descendents of Abi Talib come onto the battlefield until
they all had died one by one. Finally, Muslim bin Aquil's son was
the first of the descendents of Abi Talib to advance. Then Imam
Husain's son Ali Akbar attacked the enemy heroically and after
killing many of them he fell martyred. His martyrdom was too much
for Imam Husain ~ 11 ~ J and he began to weep. After that his
brothers Obaidullah bin Ali bin Abi Talib, Mohammad bin Ali bin
Abi Talib, Jafar bin Ali bin Abi Talib and Uthman bin Ali bin Abi
Talib attacked the enemies and after killing many they fell dead. In the
end, Imam Husain's young son Mohammad Qasim attacked them but
he also met the same fate. In short, for Imam Husain = 11 ~) his own
martyrdom and the other disasters at Karbala were not so great as his
watching, with his own eyes, his brothers and sons being martyred
and his daughters and sisters looking at such a gory and soul
shattering sight. Imam Husain's companions and members of his
family presented exemplary valor and displayed unprecedented
loyalty and self sacrifice. None of them showed weakness or
cowardice nor stood accused of disloyalty or of being hesitant. Imam
Husain = 11 ~ J at the end was left alone. Besides the women, the only
one left in the tent was Zain al-Abedeen who was only a child at that
time. Obaidullah bin Zeyad, the tyrant had sent orders that Imam
Husain's head be chopped off and his body be trampled by horses
until all the limbs were completely broken.

The Martyrdom of Imam Husain = .111 ~)
Left alone Imam Husain ~.'iii<.?~ attacked the enemies so valiantly
although none of his companions remained alive to observe the
magnificence of his attacks. Amr bin Sad and Shimr were, saying to
each other, "I have never seen such a brave and courageous man."
The sum and substance of this tragic and soul withering tale is that
Imam Husain =.'iii<.?~ received forty five wounds from arrows on his
body but continued to face the enemy the entire time. According to
another tradition, there were thirty-three wounds from spears and
forty-three sword wounds in addition to those of the arrows. In the
beginning, he was fighting on horseback but when the horse was
killed, he began to fight on foot. None of his enemies wanted to kill
Imam Husain = .'iii <.?J with his own hands, rather all of them avoided
and evaded him. At last, Shimr took six soldiers and attacked him. As
a consequence, Imam Husain's left hand was chopped off and fell to
the ground. Imam Husain= .'iii <.?J wanted to attack them in response
but his right hand was also so injured that he could not lift up the
sword. Sanan bin Anas Nakhi speared him from behind and it passed
through his abdomen. This spear wound caused him to fall to the
ground. Sanan drew out the spear and with it Imam Husain's soul
also was drawn out. Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun (To Allah do we
belong and to Him is our return).
Then Shimr himself or at his instance somebody else severed Imam
Husain's head from his body and in compliance with Obaidullah bin
Zeyad' s order, twelve horsemen were chosen. They had his sacred. _
trampled and they returned to the tent and arrested his family. When
Shirnr saw Zain al-Abedeen, the child, he wanted to kill him but Amr
bin Sad prevented him from doing so. Imam Husain's head and his
family were sent to Obaidullah bin Zeyad in Kufa. Considerable
propaganda was made of them in Kufa. Ibn Zeyad called for the
convening of his court and Imam Husain's head was presented to him
on a platter. Seeing it, he uttered some impertinent remarks and then
on the third day, he gave Shimr a division of soldiers and under his
supervision, he sent the captives and the sacred head to Yazid in
Damascus. When Ali bin Husain (Zain al-Abedeen) and all the women

80

The History of Islam

reached Yazid and when he saw Imam Husain's head, he burst into
tears in the open court. He abused Obaidullah bin Zeyad and said that
he had never order Summayya' s son to kill Husain bin Ali = .\,1,.?1 .
Then addressing Shirnr and the Iraqis he said that since he was always
pleased with obedience, why did they kill Husain bin Ali= .\,1 ,.?1 .
Shirnr and his associates expected that Yazid would reward and honor
them but he gave them nothing. On the contrary, he expressed his
displeasure and ordered them to leave. Then he said to the courtiers:
Husain's mother was better than mine, his grandfather the Prophet ~
is better than the other Prophets and is the chief of all of Adam's
descendents. However, there was a quarrel between his father Ali ,.?1
;,_;.,- .\,1 and my father Muawiya = ..:;.1,.?J· Similarly, we also fell out. Ali
'-"" .:iii ~
1 and Husain= ..:i>1,.?J both used to say "Let he whose father
and grand father was better be the Caliph." But they did not consider
the verse of the Qur' an:
"O Allah! Possessor of the kingdom, You give the kingdom to
whom you will, and You take the kingdom from whom you
witt" (3:26)
Finally, it is known as to whom Allah has favored.
Then, having released the captives, he kept them in his palace as
honored guests. When the women went into the palace, they found that
all the women there were crying just as Imam Husain's sisters were
crying for their brothers and relatives. After a few days of royal
hospitality, the ruined caravan left for Madinah.
Yazid provided them with all kinds of financial assistance and
promised Ali bin Husain (Imam Zain al-Abedeen) to give him any
type of assistance whenever he contacted him.

Obaidullah bin Zeyad's Frustration
Obaidullah bin Zeyad hoped that after the killing of Husain= ..:i>l ,.? 1
he would be honored. But Yazid, after the incident of Karbala,
appointed Silam bin Zeyad the governor of Khorasan, he also put
under him some provinces that had been attached with Basra, and
sent him to Kufa, and gave him a letter written to Obaidullah bin
Zeyad asking him to assign to Silam six thousands soldiers of Silam' s

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

81

choice. Obaidullah took this as a negative sign and began to express
sorrow at Imam Husain's loss, saying if he had been living, Yazid
would have needed him and not have reduced his rank and status but
now when Yazid became safe he started to take territory and soldiers
from under his control. When Silam took command of the Kufan
army, he asked the chiefs how many of them wanted to accompany
him to Khorasan. Each of them expressed his desire to go with him. At
night Obaidullah bin Zeyad sent his messenger to the chiefs of the
army and asked why they preferred Silam to him. They replied that
with him they had to stain their hands with the blood of the family of
the Prophet ~ while with Silam they would be getting a chance to
declare 'jihad' against the Turks and the Mongols. The next day Silam
along with six thousand selected soldiers, left Kufa and went to
Khorasan. Obaidullah bin Zeyad after the incident of Karbala,
received nothing in reward but shame and sorrow.

The Events in Makkah and Madinah
When Yazid ordered Amr bin Sad to leave Madinah and go to
Obaidullah bin Zeyad in Kufa, he sent Waleed bin Utba again as the
governor of Madinah in place of Amr bin Sad. It was Waleed bin Utba
as the governor of Madinah who, at the insistence of Abdullah bin
Jafar ~ 11~ J , had written a document to the effect that if Imam
Husain '--">-11 ~ J came to Madinah, he would be given safety and
protection. Abdullah bin Jafar = 11c?J sent that document along with
his letter to Imam Husain ..... 11c?J through the hands of his sons Aun
and Muhammad while Imam Husain= 11 c?J was on his way to Kufa.
In Makkah Yazid' s rule was over thrown and Abdullah bin Zubair <.?J
4-.J. 11 was in power. When the news of Imam Husain's martyrdom
reached there, he collected the people and made a speech:
"O people! No other people are worse than Iraqis and among the
Iraqis, the people of Kufa are the worst. They repeatedly wrote letters
and called Imam Husain ~ 11 ~ J to them and took bay' at for his
caliphate. But when Ibn Zeyad arrived in Kufa, they rallied around
him and killed Imam Husain ..... 11c?J who was a pious, observed the
fast, read the Quran and deserved the caliphate in all respects."
Saying that much Abdullah bin Zubair..,. .;;,1c?J burst into tears. The

82

The History of Islam

people told him that then no one deserved the caliphate more than he.
They requested him to stretch out his hands for bay' at and their
acceptance of him as their Caliph. In that way, all the Makkans took
bay'at for Caliphate at his hands. When the news reached Yazid, he
had a silver chain made and sent it along with two persons to Waleed
bin Utba in Madinah, he was informed that he should go to Makkah to
put the chain around Abdullah bin Zubair' s neck and arrest him.
Later on, Yazid was sorry because he knew Abdullah bin Zubair .'ii, -? 1
"-"" was not the type of man to let it be put round his neck. Utba on his
own did not comply with that order. Yazid continued to think of a
way how to overpower Abdullah bin Zubair = 11c?J and at the same
time save the Ka'bah from bloodshed. In Dhul Hijja 61 A.H., people
from all corners of Makkah started pouring in. W aleed bin U tba, the
governor of Madinah, was sent as leader of the pilgrimage from
Yazid' s side. From Makkah Abdullah bin Zubair = 1, c?J was also
the leader of the pilgrimage. In short, both performed Hajj, with
their respective groups and neither of them opposed the other.
Waleed bin Utba began to plan how to please Yazid by arresting
Abdullah bin Zubair -= 11 c?J· However, Abdullah bin Zubair 11 -? 1
= found out about Waleed's plan. When he had finished the Hajj, he
wrote a letter to Yazid:
"Though Waleed is your cousin, he is a great fool. He is spoiling
everything because of his foolishness. You should make some one else
the governor."
Yazid was very impressed by that letter. He thought that Abdullah
bin Zubair did not harbor any ill feeling in his heart against him and
that he was not opposed to him. As Marwan bin Hakam had also sent
such complaints to Yazid against Waleed, Abdullah bin Zubair's letter
did not create any doubt about the truth of the matter in his heart. He
therefore dismissed Waleed bin Utba and sent another of his cousins
Uthman bin Mohammad Abi Sufyan as governor of the holy cities.
Uthman bin Mohammad came to Madinah and started drinking,
which displeased the people very much. Uthman came to Madinah as
governor in Muharram 62 A.H. After a few days, he selected ten
persons and sent them to Yazid in Damascus. The delegation
consisted of Mundir bin Zubair, Abdullah bin Han.zla, and Abdullah

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

83

bin Amr bin Hafs bin Mughira among others. When they reached
Damascus, they were received with great hospitality by Yazid. He
gave to the first two, one hundred thousand dirhams each and to
the rest ten thousand dirhams each and saw them off. They had
seen Yazid holding singing and entertainment sessions and
indulging in unlawful activities in Damascus. While returning, they
all made up their minds to make an all out effort to oppose Yazid' s
caliphate. Nine persons came from Damascus to Madinah and one
Mandir bin Zubair went to Kufa because Obaidullah bin Zeyad and
Mandir bin Zubair were friends. He intended to go to Kufa to see
Obaidullah. When Abdullah bin Hanzla, along with his companions,
came to Madinah, the people gathered round him to know about the
conditions in Damascus.

Opposition to Yazid's Caliphate
Abdullah said that Yazid did not deserve the caliphate in the least
because he was seen indulging in unlawful acts and that it was
doubtful if he was a Muslim. The Muslirris should declare 'Jihad'
against him. The people of Madinah told him that they heard that he
was amply rewarded by Yazid . He replied that he accepted it simply
because he had no power to oppose him. When they heard that, the
people became very disgusted with Yazid. Abdullah bin Hanzla
proposed the removal of Yazid. As a result of which, the Quraish
made Abdullah bin Muti and the Ansars made Abdullah bin Hanzla
their chiefs and denied and rejected Yazid's caliphate and rule. When
Uthman bin Mohammad and all the Banu Umayyah, who numbered
one thousand in Madinah, saw this, some of them went out of
Madinah and some took refuge in the house of Marwan bin Hakam.
The people of Madinah arrested and imprisoned all the Banu
Umayyah they could find. They said nothing to Marwan' s son Abdul
Malik who always lived in the service of Sayeed bin Almusayyeb the
Schollor of Madinah and he rarely went out of the mosque and was
considered to be a great devotee to religious practices, very pious and
virtuous. Banu Umayyah informed Yazid in Damascus of the
prevalent situation there. Yazid at once wrote to Obaidullah bin
Zeyad that Mandir bin Zubair who had been to him in Kufa, should

84

The History of Islam

immediately be arrested and imprisoned in order to prevent his entry
into Madinah. As Obaidullah bin Zeyad was not pleased with Yazid
because the latter did not value and honor him for killing Imam
Husain, he sent Mandir away to Madinah at once and wrote to Yazid
that Mandir had left for Madinah before he received his letter. After
reaching Madinah, Mandir told Abdullah bin Hanzala and Abdullah
bin Muti to take bay'at at Ali bin Husain's (Imam Zain al-Abedeen's)
hands for caliphate. He then went to Ali bin Husain with a group. Ali
bin Husain frankly refused and said that both his father and
grandfather had lost their lives for the sake of the caliphate and that
he dared not run the risk of doing such a thing and killing himself.
Saying so he went to stay in a village outside of Madinah.
Marwan, who along with other Banu Umayyah was imprisoned in his
own house, sent a message to Ali bin Husain (Imam Zain al-Abedeen)
through Abdul Malik saying that what he did was quite right but he
wanted some other help from him. He sent some valuable goods and
members of his family to be looked after by him because there was no
room for them in his crowed house, Ali bin Husain conceded to the
request. Marwan bin Hakam, under the cover of a dark night, sent his
family and some expensive goods to him in the village. Ali bin Husain
(Imam Zain al-Abedeen) wrote to Yazid the detailed situation of what
was going on in Madinah. He wrote about himself that he was loyal to
him and trying his best to support and safeguard Banu Umayyah.
Becoming acquainted with the situation in Madinah, Yazid called
Noman bin Basheer Ansari '--'-" ..:.1 <r'.J and told him to go to Madinah
and make the people see reason, tell them to stop their evil activities
and not to create the possibility of bloodshed in Madinah. He also
asked him to pressure Abdullah bin . Hanzla and mention that he
visited Yazid, received gifts and rewards, returned highly pleased
from there but then turned to be his enemy after corning to Madinah.
By undoing the bay' at and issuing the religious judgment of Kufr
(declaring him an unbeliever) against him incited the people and in so
doing did not act wisely. He further asked him to go to Ali bin Husain
= .'ii, <r'J (Imam Zain al-Abedeen) with his message that his loyalty and
achievements would certainly be honored and that he should tell the
Banu Umayyah with him that they could not even suppress the 'fitna'
(evil disorder) in Madinah by killing the two who created it. After

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

85

hearing about all these instructions, Noman bin Basheer "---'>- .11 c?_)
mounted a female camel and proceeded to Madinah. There he tried to
make the people understand that it was not in everybody's interest to
make these problems, but in vain. Becoming frustrated he returned to
Damascus and briefed Yazid with all that happened. Yazid called
Muslim bin Oqba and ordered him to rush to Madinah along with one
thousand selected cavalry and ask the people there to obey and in case
of disobedience, fight them until they were humbled and disciplined.
Muslim bin Oqba replied that he was loyal but unwell at the time.
Yazid told him that even in that state he was better than the other
healthy persons and that no one else could do the job better than he.
Compelled in this way, he selected one thousand soldiers and left
from Damascus on the third day after he was ordered. Yazid, at the
time of departure, urged him:
"Try to bring the people of Madinah to the right path with all possible
soft measures. However, if you are convinced that such measures will
not work, then I give you all the power not to be slow in causing
bloodshed and slaughter. But be careful and see no harm is done to
Husain bin Ali (Imam Zain al-Abedeen) because he is loyal and a
supporter. I have his letter, which says that he has nothing to do with
the uproar and rebellion. If your condition deteriorates and rendering
you incapable of commanding the army, you may depute Haseen bin
Numair in your place. You may also make him your deputy."
After sending the army, Yazid sent a messenger to Obaidullah bin
Zeyad with a letter asking him to take an army from Kufa and invade
Makkah and eradicate Abdullah bin Zubair' s disruption. Obaidullah
wrote back that it was beyond him to do both things: he had already
killed Imam Husain '-'->- .11 c?.J and that he would not ruin and lay the
Ka'bah to waste. That work should be entrusted to somebody else.
When Muslim bin Oqba reached near Madinah with his army, the
inhabitants of the city told Abdullah bin Hanzla that Banu Umayyah
who were in Madinah would side with the enemies if the army of
Damascus came and thereby cause civil war, which would inflict a
great loss on them. Therefore they argued, it was better that they
should all be put to death before the arrival of Muslim bin Oqba.
Abdullah bin Hanzla replied that if they killed Banu Umayyah, Yazid

86

The History of Islam

and Obaidullah bin Zeyad with the Syrians and Iraqis respectively
would invade them and demand revenge. He said it was better that all
the Banu Umayyah should be called, make them swear neither to fight
with them nor help the invaders against them and after that they
should be turned out of Madinah. All agreed to the proposal. The
proposal was executed accordingly with the only exception of Abdul
Malik bin Marwan who was granted full liberty to remain in the city.
The people who were turned out of the city came across the army of
Muslim bin Oqba·in Wadi al-Qura. Muslim bin Oqba asked them from
which side he should launch an attack on Madinah. They refused to
answer him in view of their pledge and pleaded helplessness in
assisting him. Muslim bin Oqba wanted to know whether there was
anybody among them who did not take any pledge. They said that
Abdul Malik bin Marwan was such a man and he was in Madinah.
Muslim said that Abdul Malik was young while he needed an old and
experienced man well versed in the strategies of war. They told him
that this young man was better than an old man. Muslim bin Oqba
therefore sent someone to Madinah and contacted him. Muslim bin
Oqba was stunned to hear his counsel and implemented it. He reached
near Madinah and sent a message to its people: The caliph, Yazid,
considers you to be noble. He does not like to shed your blood. You
must obey or we shall be forced to take our swords out of their sheaths.
Having sent the message, Muslim bin Oqba waited for three days. The
people of Madinah prepared to fight. At last Muslim bin Oqba
invaded Madinah from the Harra side. They people of the city fought
them valiantly and repulsed the Syrian soldiers. However, due to
Muslim bin Oqba' s valor and experience, the people of Madinah were
defeated. Abdullah bin Hanzla, Fuzail bin Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib,
Mohammad bin Thabit bin Qais, Abdullah bin Zaid bin Asim,
Mohammad bin Amr bin Hazm Ansari, Wahab bin Abdullah bin
Zama, Zubair bin Abdur Rahman bin Auf, Abdullah bin Naufil bin
Harith bin Abdul Muttalib and many other leaders of Madinah met
their end in that battle. The victorious army entered Madinah. Muslim
bin Oqba continued a general massacre with looting and arson for
three days. That battle and massacre saw one thousand people dead,
which included three hundred noblemen of the Quraish and the
Ansar. On the fourth day, he stopped the massacre and ordered them

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

87

to take 'bay'at. Those who took bay'at at Muslim bin Oqba's hands
survived and those who refused were killed. It was on the 27 th of Dhul
Hijja 63 A.H. that Muslim bin Oqba entered Madinah as victor and
issued the orders for a general massacre. On that very day,
Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib was born.
He is known as Mohammad Abul Abbas Saffah and is regarded as the
first caliph of the Abbasids. Muslim bin Oqba made a hectic s.earch of
Mundir bin Zubair but he had escaped to Makkah.

The Siege of Makkah and Yazid's Death
Freed from Madinah, Muslim bin Oqba with his army, advanced
towards Makkah. He was ill and on the way his condition
deteriorated and when it turned more serious at Abwa, he called
Haseen bin Numer and made him commander in chief in his place,
and died. Those who fled from Madinah also gathered in Makkah.
The Khawarij also thought it worthwhile to help Abdullah bin Zubair
who had arrived in Makkah. That year all the people of the Hijaz had
taken 'ba'it' for the caliphate of Abdullah bin Zubair. Haseen bin
Numer taking his army arrived, near Makkah and sent a message to
Abdullah bin Zubair -..._.c.,. .iii ..;-"'J to obey Yazid or he would invade
Makkah. Abdullah bin Zubair w- .iii,?; made preparations for battle.
His brother Mundir bin Zubair = .11,?J who came from Madinah was
appointed chief of a section of Abdullah bin Zubair's army. It was he
who first came out onto the battlefield and challenged the Syrians. In
the initial fight, he killed several Syrians and then the full-fledged
battle started. It continued until the evening without any tangible
results. It started on Muharram 27 th 64 A.H. The next day Haseen bin
Numer set up a catapult on Mount Qubais and started targeting the
Ka'bah and laid siege to Makkah. The siege and stone firing continued
until Rabia al-Awwal 3, 64 A.H. On the 3rd of Rabia al-Awwal the
Syrians made projectiles of cotton and _sulfur and igniting them began
to shower them on the Makkans. They burnt the Ka'bah's cover and
blackened its walls. Two catapults were constantly launching stones
and projectiles. It was difficult for the people of Makkah to venture
out of their houses. The walls of the Ka'bah were broken under the
impact of the flying stones and its roof caved in. The Syrians's that
were making the siege became tougher, their total number after

88

The History of Islam

reinforcements came to five thousand. The Syrians were continuing to
launch stones on the House of Allah and the city while on the 10th of
Rabia al-Awwal Yazid died at Hawarin at the age of 38 or 39 after
governing for three years and eight months. The news of his death
first reached Abdullah bin Zubair = 11._,.;,.;. He shouted loudly to the
Syrians: 0 unfortunate ones! Why are you fighting? Your leader who
had gone astray is dead .
Haseen bin Numer did not give credence to it but attributed it to one
of Abdullah bin Zubair's strategies. However, on the third day Thabit
bin Qais Nakhye came from Kufa and informed him ofYazid's death,
he at once ordered the army to raise the siege and march. Before his
departure, he sent a message to Abdullah bin Zubair '--'->- 11~ .)
expressing his desire to see him at Batha.
In keeping with the terms of the agreement, Abdullah bin Zubair ._iP.;
= 11 took ten persons with him and similarly ten persons accompanied
Haseen bin Numer. Haseen said to him, "I am ready to accept you as
caliph and take ba'it at your hands. I have five thousand Syrian
warriors with me. They will also follow me. Please come to Syria with
me and I shall persuade all the Syrians to take ba' it from you. All the
people of Hijaz have already taken bay'at at your hands and after the
Syrians the whole Islamic world will accept you as the caliph."
Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 ._,.;,.; thought that he was being deceived, so
he refused and said that so long as he did not have retribution against
the Syrians, he would never forgive them. Haseen talked in a low
voice while Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 ._,.;,.; replied loudly and roughly.
Haseen said, "I want to give you the caliphate and you quarrel with
me and reply in a rough voice." In short, Haseen left the place and
returned to his army and ordered it to march. Later, Abdullah bin
Zubair ,___;.;, 11~.) realized his mistake and he sent a messenger to
Haseen asking him not to force him to go to Syria rather to take ba'it
in Makkah. Haseen said, "The purpose would not be served if you
don't come to Syria." In the end, Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 ._iP.; did not
leave and Haseen departed from Makkah. When he reached near to
Madinah, he came to know that upon hearing of Yazid's death the
people in Madinah again stood against the Banu Umayyah and drove
the governor who Muslim bin Oqba had deputed there out of

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

89

Madinah. When Haseen encamped near Madinah, the uproar in
Madinah subsided and all the Banu Umayyah joined Haseen's army
and requested him to take them to Syria with him. Haseen asked them
to stay for the night promising to march with them the next morning.
At night, he went out in search of Ali bin Husain. He met him and
said to him:
Yazid is dead. There is no Imam of the world of Islam at present.
Accompany me to Syria. I shall persuade the whole world to take
bay'at for your calipj1ate. Don't take the Syrians to be like the Iraqis.
They will never betray you nor will they harm you.
Ali bin Husain said: "I have made a pledge with Allah that I shall
never take ba'it in my lifetime. Leave me alone and find somebody
else for the caliphate." Having said that he parted from Haseen.
Haseen returned to his army and taking the Banu Umayyah with him
marched to Syria.

Conquests During Yazid's Reign
We have reached Yazid's death but it remains to be mentioned that
Oqba bin Nafe, the founder of the city of Qairwan (in modern day
north-central Tunisia), had left North Africa and had gone to Amir
Muawiya= .'iii i.?j in Damascus and complained against Abul Muhajir.
Amir Muawiya -= 11 i.?j had promised to send him to North Africa as
the commander in chief. Death had overtaken Amir Muawiya=- .'iii i.?j
before he could fulfill his commitment. Immediately after becoming
caliph, Yazid deputed Oqba as the commander and sent him to North
Africa. Oqba reached Qairwan, arrested Abul Muhajir and threw him
into prison. The reason was that Abu] Muhajir, during his reign tried
to defame him unjustifiably by abusing him. In that state of captivity
Abu! Muhajir died but before he died he warned him to beware of a
newly converted Berber Muslim named Kusaila. It was Abu! Muhajir
who had convinced him about Islam and he knew his nature and
habits, he was sure that because Oqba had imprisoned him, Kusalia, if
he had the opportunity would certainly take revenge. Oqba did not
pay much attention to it and he let him continue to be chief of one part
of his army . ln 62 A.H. Oqba called his sons and as his last will and
testament, said to them: "I am going in the way of Allah for Jihad and

The History of Islam

90

I wish earnestly to get martyrdom". Then he left Zuhair bin Qais
Balwi with a small army for the protection of Qairwan and he set out
along with an army of the mujahideen (Literally: those who struggle,
connoting warriors fighting for the sake of Islam) to the west. There
was a confrontation with the Roman army' in the city of Baghana.
After a sharp encounter, the Romans retreated. Again, the Romans
fought them at the city of Arba and they also lost that battle. Seeing
the onrushing flood of Muslim victories they allied themselves with
the Berbers who had not yet converted to Islam. That huge army of
Romans and Berbers stood their ground against the small Muslim
army. After a bloody battle, the Muslim gained a decisive victory.
Finally, they fought the last battle with the Romans at the city of
Tangier in which the Roman governor surrendered himself to Oqba
bin Nafe. Oqba set him free and without causing any damage to the
city moved on. He conquered the entire territory of Morocco and he
arrived at the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. Having reached the coast,
he ran his horse into the sea and said,
0 Allah! Had this sea not intervened in my way I would have
gone on fighting in your way until the end of the earth.

Martyrdom of Oqba
Oqba thought about returning to Qairwan. The whole of North Africa
had been included in the Islamic conquests. On his return journey, he
subdivided his army into various parts and sent them off separately
and one part he kept with him. On the way, they reached a place
where water was not available. They began to die from thirst and
Oqba made a du' a (prayer) to Allah. His horse began to strike its
hooves on the ground and amazingly a fountain shot up from that
exact place. They all drank to their hearts content. It came to be known
as 'Ma-ul-fars' (the water of the horsemen) and it is still known by this
same name. When he set out with his small regiment and reached
Hatuza, the Romans and the Berbers, seeing his small regiment
wanted to fight even though they had already surrendered to him.
Kusaila who was with Oqba took advantage of the situation, he parted
with him and joined the Romans, encouraging his countrymen, and he
led a large army on the attack and surrounded the small regiment.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

91

The handful of Muslims unsheathed their sword and set to killing
their enemies. They killed a large number of Romans and Berbers and
made a pile of dead bodies and then they fell martyred one by one,
and Oqba bin Nafe's longing for martyrdom was finally fulfilled.
Kusaila along with his large army marched towards Qairwan. When
the news reached Qairwan that Oqba met his martyrdom and that a
large army was approaching, Zuhair bin Qais made preparations for
battle, but dissension and disunity broke out among his army . Qais
failed to bring it under control. Compelled by this, the Muslims had
to leave Qairwan and proceeded towards Barqah and Kusaila
occupied Qairwan.

A Glance at Yazid's Caliphate
Yazid reigned for about three years and nine months. During that
period no territorial victories outside of North Africa came to the
Muslims, to be more precise following Amir Muawiya's= .'i,1 ,.?J 20
year long rule as caliph the period of infighting and indifference to
foreign conquests had commenced. The greatest slur on Yazid's
caliphate was Imam Husain's martyrdom, which has brought into
prominence his other shortcomings. Considering these factors with the
desire to get to the truth we should in going to the heart of the matter
peacefully ponder over what were the motives working behind the
tyranny perpetrated upon Imam Husain ~ .1i1 ~ J and the brutal
treatment, which was meted out to him at Karbala.

It can not be denied that at the instance of Mughira bin Shoba = .'i,1 ,.?J,
Amir Muawiya '----"" .'iii ,.?J nominated Yazid as his successor otherwise
he would never have thought of making his son the caliph after him. It
was Mughira bin Shoba who was the first to introduce that idea.
Because that proposal was absolutely against the tradition of the
'Khilafat-Rashida' (the rightly guided caliphate) and the spirit of
Islamic democracy, opposition to it started at once in Madinah.
Therefore, Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr, Abdullah bin U~ar,
Abdullah bin Zubair and Imam Husain r+---"' 11 ~ J opposed it
vehemently. When Marwan put the problem before the wise and
sober people of Madinah, it met with stiff opposition from all quarters .

Abdullah bin Zubair = .ii.1 ,_,?_; said clearly: "No other modes but thq.se
of the Prophet ~ and Khulfa ar-Rashideen will be acceptable to us in

selecting the caliph is that of the Roman and Iranian emperors. It is
not acceptable to us. Imam Husain ~ .ii.1 ,_,?_; said, "This selection is not
meant for the betterment but for the annihilation of the Muslims
because by this way the Islamic caliphate will be like that practiced by
Caesar or Kisra, that is the son will succeed his father as king.
Amir Muawiya
.ii.1 ~ .J in order to make them agree went to the
extent of sending the following words to those wise people. You
should accept him as caliph only in name. The rest of affairs, law and
order, appointments and transfers of post-holders and other
administrative activities will be done with your consultation. But even
that failed to produce the desired result and none of them was ready
to accept it.
L_;$.

Now imagine the sentiments of the common masses and the character
of Yazid. Amir Muawiya ~ .ii.1~ .J issued instructions to all his
governors to narrate to the people Yazid's virtues and send to him
delegations of the influential people so that he himself might have a
direct talk with them on the issue. Consequently he talked to the
delegations separately that came to him from all the provinces and
then gathered them all at one place and made a speech in which he,
after highlighting the rights and duties of caliphs, obedience to the
rulers and the responsibilities of the common masses, mentioned
Yazid' s bravery, generosity, wisdom, suitability and administrative
skill and finally expressed his wish that bay'at should be taken for
Yazid's succession. However, in response a member of the delegation
from Madinah, Mohammad bin Amr bin Hazam, stood up and said,
"Amir al-Muminin! You are making Yazid the caliph but you should
think about that you will have to answer to Allah for this act of yours
on the Day of Judgement." These words amply prove that the people
in general did not like Yazid's caliphate. Coupled with this that even
at Amir Muawiya's death the type of disobedience he displayed
throws light on how far he Was fit for the caliphate.
With the joint efforts of Mughira bin Shoba and Amir Muawiya, Yazid

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

93

became the caliph of the Islamic world. Taking ba'it for Yazid in his
lifetime was Amir Muawiya's blunder and it was committed probably
out of fatherly affection. But Mughira bin Shoba's mistake was worse
than his because it only came to his mind at Mughira bin Shoba's
i suggestion. Furthermore, Yazid, after taking over the reign, failed to
prove himself fit for the caliphate. He knew fully well that there were
living elders who by virtue of their chaste habits and disposition, high
morals, habits of worship, abstinence from material pleasures, their
practical life and their strength of Iman were guiding lights, yet he did
not take advantage of their presence. Instead of running his
administration by availing himself of their counsel he began to
perpetrate tyranny immediately after becoming caliph, and issued
i. instructions to all his governors to take ba'it from all the elders present
in Madinah and Makkah. When Imam Husain = ..1.t1 <?.; received the
message, how could he, a man of such high status, take bay' at for
Yazid? First of all his selection was out and out unlawful and his
government was also unlawful. Secondly, from the viewpoint" of
deeds and character he was so debased that he was always engaged in
amusement, fun, touring and hunting. He had appointed eunuchs to
serve him, participated in singing and dancing parties openly, those
and other character faults in him rendered him absolutely unfit for
becoming the Muslims, caliph even for a single minute. How could
Imam Husain "-'-'" ..:;.,1 ~ .; accept him as caliph and take bay'at at his
hands? These were the motives that compelled Imam Husain ;,cs; ..:;.,1 ,.?.;
to oppose the illegal system of Yazid's reign. By his act against the
unlawful government he lighted a lamp the light of which will
continue to guide the caravans of the lovers of truth and justice until
the Day of Reckoning. Imam Husain= ..1.t1 ,.?.; therefore mentioned this
fact in his addresses he delivered at Karbala and during his journey.
At Baida, he addressed Hur and his companions thus:
0 people! The Prophet ~ has said, "One who sees a king who is a
tyrant, makes lawful the things made unlawful by Allah, breaks his
pledge made with Allah, opposes the sunnah of the Prophet~, rules
over the slaves of Allah with sin and oppression and the onlooker is
not ashamed at his speech and practice, then everyone is justified in
throwing into Hell instead of the king in question." Understanding
fully that these people (Yazid and his court) obeyed Satan and gave

94

The History of Islam

up obeying Ar-Rahman (Allah). They have spread mischief on the
earth, paralyzed the laws prescribed by Allah, taken the lion's share of
the spoils of war, have taken the things Allah has made lawful and
made them unlawful and vice versa and therefore I am justified in
fighting according to the rules of Islam such misdeeds.
These were the causes that brought Imam Husain= 11 -?) to Karbala.
He and his family while uttering words of truth were martyred in
their attempt to exterminate an unlawful system.
From the general view, Yazid was not a true successor to Amir
Muawiya "'---"" 11 ~
)- He had not much , to do with religion and
spiritualism. He did not display any merit in governance and politics.
Had he been even a little discerning he would have first made an
attempt to make the people forget the dispute between Amir Muawiya
~ .11 ._.;,,,; and Ali bin Abi T,alib = .11 -?,;- But he either did not pay much
heed° to it or failed due to his own character faults. The model of
practical life that Yazid presented before the people also contained sins
and unlawful acts, harmed the Muslim's religious outlook and their
practical lives and people of weak Iman witnessing the royal model, felt
emboldened to commit sins. It was Yazid's ugly example that provided
impetus to the Muslims to take up singing, playing music otherwise
prior to his display the Islamic world was absolutely free from these
defects. Even up to Yazid's reign, the Muslims had not accepted the
principle of caliphate by succession in government and politics. They
knew that the act of Yazid succeeding Amir Muawiya as caliph was a
gross mistake and it needed to be rectified. It was because of this that
Haseen bin Numer wanted Abdullah bin Zubair to be the caliph. However,
after Yazid's death the idea of succession was strengthened by the
actions of Banu Umayyah and finally this evil practice took such a deep
root that until now the Muslims have not been able to get rid of it.
Yazid was first married to Umm Hisham bint Utba bin Rabiya and
had two sons, Muawiya and Khalid, by her. He loved Khalid more but
he made Muawiya his successor. Th,en he married Umm Kulthum bint
Abdullah bin Amir who gave birth to Abdullah bin Yazid who was
well known for his excellent archery. Besides these, a few sons were
born of his female slaves also.

Muawiya bin Yazid
At the time of Yazid's death, Muawiya bin Yazid also known as Abu
Laila and Abu Abdur Rahman was twenty years and a few months
old. He was young, pious and devout. The Syrians took bay' at at his
hands after Yazid's death. When Haseen bin Numer along with his
army and those of Banu Umayyah who left Madinah, reached Syria,
the bay'at for him had already taken place. Muawiya was not
interested in his own caliphate and the taking of ba'it. He was a little
sickly also, and in that state of sickness, people took bay'at for him. He
took bay'at under pressure and after forty days or according to a
second tradition after two months and yet according to a third
tradition after three months died as caliph. During that short period,
he was not able to do anything worth mentioning. When his· condition
worsened, they requested him to nominate someone to be caliph after
him. Muawiya said to them:
"I had no power to run the caliphate from the beginning. You made
me caliph by force. I thought to hand it over to a person like Umar bin
Khattab ~ 11 ~ J if available but in vain. Then again, I wanted to do
just as he had done and nominate a few persons entrusted with the
task of selecting the caliph but I failed to find such persons. You are at
liberty to make caliph anyone whom you like because I will have
nothing to do with it."
Saying that Muawiya made the people leave his palace and had the
doors closed. After that, it was not he but his dead body that went out
of the palace.

Bay~t for lbn Zeyad in Basra
The caliphate of Muawiya bin Yazid was accepted only by the Syrians
and the Egyptians. The people of the Hijaz had taken bay'at at
Abdullah bin Zubair's hands. When the news of Yazid's death
reached Iraq, Obadiullah bin Zeyad was present in Basra. He collected
the people and said to them:
"The Amir al-Muminin is dead. There is no one in sight who has the
capacity to run the caliphate. I am born in this country and I have

96

The History of Islam

been brought up here. My father ruled here and at present, I am
the ruler here.
The income of our territory is more than before. The treasury is
stronger than before. Salaries and stipends given to the people are
far more than before. The country is free from the presence of the
mischievous and the wicked. You may establish your own separate
caliphate if you like because you are not dependent on the
Syrians."
Having heard the speech, everyone expressed their readiness to take
ba'it at his hands. Therefore, the people of Basra took bay'at at his
hands but in the heart, they did not like him. Taking ba'it from
them, Obaidullah went to Kufa in order to take bay'at from the
people there but they refused him openly. When the people of Basra
came to know that the inhabitants of Kufa did not accept lbn Zeyad,
they annulled their oaths. Compelled and helpless lbn Zeyad fled
from Iraq and arrived in Damascus. He reached there when
Muawiya bin Yazid had breathed his last, there were many disputes
and the country was in an uproar of confusion in connection with
the selection of the caliphate.

lbn Zubair' s Caliphate in Iraq
The situation in Kufa showed that after the disaster of Karbala the
people felt very moved by the martyrdom of Imam Husain-= 11 _..;,)Those who called him by sending letters to him and then took part in
killing him, felt very ashamed and repentant. lbn Zeyad did not get
any reward rather a part of Khorasan (corresponding to modern
northeastern Iran, southern Turkmenistan, and northern Afghanistan)
was taken from under his control and he too was repentant
concerning Imam Husain's killing and did not stop the people of Kufa
from repentance. The partisans of Husain in Kufa gathered at
Sulaiman bin Sard Khazai's house and held a closed-door meeting,
they confessed their faults and in order to expiate their errors agreed
to the proposal to avenge Imam Husain's blood. Consequently, all of
them took bay'at at Sulaiman's hands. He exhorted them to stick to
their determination and avoid giving vent to it prematurely and
gradually convert the people to their opinion and when the

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

97

opportunity presented itself, they would rise up and avenge his
assassination.
When Obaidullah bin Zeyad wanted to turn the attention of the
people of Kufa towards taking bay'at for him, they refused in keeping
with Sulaiman's instructions and plans and they continued making
preparations for taking revenge. Hearing of Yazid's death the
partisans of Ali requested Sulaiman to rebel. But he asked them not to
do so at that time because a good number of the people of Kufa were
still not in favor of undertaking the work agreed upon and it was
more prudent to keep trying separately for a few days more to
increase their number~ and strength.
After rejecting Ibn Zeyad 's proposal the people of Kufa drove out
Amr bin Harith who was the appointed governor of Kufa by Ibn
Zeyad and accepted Abdullah bin Zubair's caliphate. Abdullah bin
Zubair ~ 11 ~) sent Abdullah bin Yazid Ansari and Ibrahim bin
Mohammad biil Talha as governor and tax collector of Kufa
respectively. One week before the arrival of Abdullah bin Zubair's
governor, Mukhtar bin Abu Obaida who had gone to Mohammad bin
Al Hanafia, returned to Kufa. This took place in Ramadan 64 A.H. The
people of Basra also made Abdullah bin Harith their chief after Ibn
Zeyad's expulsion and in imitation of the people of Kufa, sent their
delegation to Abdullah bin Zubair ~ 11 ~) and recognized his
caliphate. Thus, Abdullah bin Zubair's reign over the whole of Iraq
was fully established.

lbn Zubair's Caliphate in Egypt
The Egyptian governor was Abdur Rahman bin Jehdan. When he
heard the news of Muawiya bin Yazid's death, he at once took bay'at,
(oath of allegiance) for Abdullah bin Zubair's caliphate through a
delegation. Noman bin Basheer and Zafar bin Harith were the
governors of Hims (also spelled Homs, city, central Syria) and
Qansareen (one of the five original provinces that the conquering
Arabs divided greater Syria into, now northern Syria) respectively.
Both of them thought it proper to recognize Abdullah bin Zubair's
caliphate on hearing about Muawiya bin Yazid's death. Because no
caliph could be selected quickly after Muawiya bin Yazid's death, the

98

The History of Islam

peopJ.e of Damascus took bay' at for Dahhak bin Qais on the
condition that they accept him as their Amir and Imam and obey
him until the selection by the Muslims of the Amir and Caliph of all
of them. Dahhak bin Qais also thought Abdullah bin Zubair = 1, <.?~
alone to be superior to the others. The governor of Palestine Hassan
bin Malik wanted the new caliph to be from the tribe of Banu
Umayyah. In short at Muawiya bin Yazid's death the whole Islamic
world had agreed to Abdullah bin Zubair's caliphate and with the
exception of Banu Umayyah, all the rest of the influential people
were determined upon finishing for good the matter of hereditary
succession in connection with the caliphate and they wanted
Abdullah bin Zubair as the caliph.
We have read about Obaidullah bin Zeyad's fate after Yazid in the
previous pages. Now we will read about the fate of his brother
Muslim bin Zeyad who governed Khorasan.
When the news of Yazid's death reached Khorasan, Muslim bin Zeyad
said to the people that as Yazid was dead and so long as a new caliph
was not selected and had not issued instructions, they should take
bay'at for him. The people of Khorasan gladly did so but a few days
after they nullified it. Muslim bin Zeyad also met the same fate, as his
brother Obaidullah bin Zeyad in Iraq. Muslim bin Zeyad, deputed
Muhallab bin Abi Sufra governor of Kho~asan in his place, and
intended to go to Damascus. He met Abdullah bin Hazim on the way
and he appointed ibn Hazim, the governor of Khorasan, and Muhallab
bin Sufra remained as the commander in chief as usual. Abdullah bin
Hazim reached Khorasan and humbled and disciplined all the rebels.
While the matter of the caliphate was being decided in Damascus in
Khorasan Abdullah bin Hazim was fighting and defeating the Turks
and Mongols and establishing and popularizing Islam.
Had Abdullah bin Zubair agreed to Haseen bin Numer's proposal and
gon~ to Syria, there is little do1.1bt that his caliphate would have been
established and stabilized and after becoming the caliph of the Islamic
World, he alone could have exterminated all the evils which had
already taken deep root in the Islamic territories. However, it was n9t
to be and the inevitable, which was against this, happened.

Caliphate of Banu Llmayyah (First Phase)

99

Marwan bin Hakam
Marwan bin Hakam bin Abi Al-Aas bin Umayyah bin Abd Shams bin
Abd Mana£ was born in 2 A.H. His mother was known by the name of
Amna bint Alqaman bin Safwan. He had been the head clerk and
minister during Uthman bin Affan 's ~ 11 ~ ; period of caliphate.
During Amir Muawiya's reign, he governed Madinah several times.
Following Muawiya bin Yazid's death, it was Abdullah bin Zubair ._?;
= 11 had been the caliph for six or seven months. With the exception of
Marwan, none from among Banu Umayyah had a claim to the
caliphate. All the governors and administrators had accorded
recognition to Abdullah bin Zubair' s caliphate. After struggling for six
or seven months, Marwan succeeded in occupying Syria. Therefore,
Marwan can be considered to be a rebel and as Banu Umayyah had
lost the caliphate, he can be credited with the revival of the caliphate
for Banu Umayyah.

8t1y~t for the Caliphate and the Battle of Marj Rabat
After Muawiya bin Yazid's death as mentioned earlier, there
appeared two sects in Syria. One was Banu Umayyah who justified
the caliphate on the basis that it belonged to their tribe alone, and the
other comprising of Dahhak bin Qais, the governor of Damascus and
' like minded officers and administrators who inwardly supported
his
Abdullah bin Zubair's caliphate but kept silent. First of all Noman bin
Basheer """ 11? ; began to take bay' at in Hims in the name of Abdullah
bin Zubair = 11 ..? J· The governor of Qansareen, Zafar bin Harith, also
followed suit. In Damascus Banu Umayyah and Banu Kalb were in the
majority. Those two tribes were like-minded and critical of Abdullah
bin Zubair. Dahhak bin Qais who inwardly sided with Abdullah bin
Zubair did not express it openly, ruled over Damascus. The
inhabitants of Damascus were in. the dark about the fact that the
armies of Hims and Qansareen had taken bay'at for Abdullah bin
Zubair's caliphate. lt was, Hassan bin Malik Kalbi the governor of
Palestine and a supporter of the Banu Umayyah due to his relation
with them, got the inforMotion first. Making Ruh bin Zamba his
deputy, he said, "The leaders of Ibn Zubair's army continue to take

100

History of Islam

bay'at for him from the people. The people of my tribe are in Jordan
and I will go there to inform them. You must be vigilant here and kill
those who oppose us." Having insisted in this manner he went to
Jordan. Immediately after his departure, N-abil bin Qais, as a
supporter of Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 .?j expelled Ruh bin Zamba
from Palestine. Ruh went to Hassan bin Malik in Jordan and
Palestine was annexed to Abdullah bin Zubair's caliphate. Hassan
bin Malik assembled the Jordanians and incited them against
Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 .?J and promised that they would try to
make Khalid bin Yazid bin Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan the caliph.
Hassan also came to know that Dahhak bin Qais, the governor of
Damascus, was a secret follower of ibn Zubair but Hassan did not
reve~J it and chose another method to deal with this problem.
Hassan using the strategy of politics wrote Dahhak bin Qais a letter
containing the vices attributed to Abdullah bin Zubair and stated
that Dahhak was the rightful claimant of the caliphate for Banu
Umayyah. Further, he drew his attention to the fact that the people
were continuing to take bay'at for Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 .?; and
asked him to remedy this at once. The messenger carrying the letter
to Damascus was instructed that he should read the letter to Dahhak
bin Qais in the central mosque on Friday before all the influential
people of the city and the Banu Umayyah. The purpose of this was
to create and obstacle between Dahhak bin Qais and ibn Zubair, to
destroy Dahhak's credibility with Abdullah bin Zubair, and to cause
confusion among Dahhak' s followers .

At the mosque in Damascus, a large number of Dahhak bin Qais's
followers were present. When they l1eard the letter, they were
divided into two groups. One was the Banu Umayyah and their
followers and the other w~ Abdullah binZubair's supporters. Both
the groups clashed and they went to the extent of taking arms
against the other and prepared to attack each other. However,
Khalid bin Yazid bin Muawiya intervened and pacified them and
prevented them from fighting, Dahhak bin Qais left the mosque
silently and entered his house and did not come out for three days.
During that period Obaidullah bin Zeyad who had been expelled
from Iraq and frustrated; had fled to Syria and arrived in Damascus.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

101

His arrival in Damascus gave great strength to the Banu Umayyah
and their followers. Dahhak bin Qais and Banu Umayyah together
proceeded to Jabia. Thour bin Maan Sulami went to Dahhak and said
to him, "You gave us counsel to take bay'at for Abdullah bin Zubair
'--"" 11~ ) and we accepted it. And now at the instance of Hassan bin
Malik Kalbi, you want to try to arrange the ba' it for his sister's son
Khalid bin Yazid ." Dahhak was ashamed and asked him what his
opinion was. He said, "Express what you have concealed so far and
invite the people openly to take bay'at for Abdullah bin Zubair."
Dahhak parted along with his supporters and halted at Marj Rahat.
Banu Umayyah and Banu Kalb were stationed at Jabia. Hassan along
with his followers also arrived there from Jordan. Five thousand of the
Banu Umayyah and Banu Kalb had assembled at Jab~a while Dahhak
bin Qais had only one thousand of the Banu Qais at Marj Rahat with
him. The deputy whom Dahhak bin Qais left in Damascus was
expelled by Yazid bin Anis and took over the captured treasury,
which was really a great defeat for Dahhak. Had Damascus and the
treasury been in his possession he would not have suffered such a
blow to his power. From Marj Rahat he sent inforMotion to Noman
bin Basheer, Zafar bin Harith and Nayel bin Qais in Hims, Qansareen
and Palestine. The problem that came first before any other work for
the Banu Umayyah was choosing the Imamate and caliph.
(Editors note: Imamate literally concerns leadership and Caliph
connotes the representative of Allah on earth, this term is also used to
describe all the sons of Adam and their position and responsibility
while on this earth. These two terms cover the spiritual and temporal
leadership of the Muslims and can be used interchangeably
depending on the context as the concept of separation of the state
from religion does not exist in Islam. In Arabic these terms and their
derivations are commonly used and they are not terms that are
exclusively used for this specific terminology only as the word Pope is
in English.)
Khalid bin Yazid was
inclined to him.

Marwan began to coax the people for his own caliphate and Ruh bin

102

History of Islam

Zamba in his support addressed the gathering in the following words:
Khalid bin Yazid is quite young now. We need a clever and
experienced caliph. Therefore, none is better than Marwan bin
Hakam. He is experienced and he has been doing the work of the
caliphate and governing since the days of Uthrnan bin Affan = 11<?J·
It is only proper that we select Marwan as our caliph provided that
after his term, Khalid bin Yazid would be the caliph and after him
Amr bin Sayeed Aas should be entrusted with the caliphate.
The choice of caliph remained under discussion at Jabia for forty days.
At long last, Ruh bin Zamba's proposal with the support and effort of
Obaidullah bin Zeyad, was approved and on 3 Dhul Qada 64 A.H. at
Jabia, the Banu Umayyah, Banu Kalb, Ghassan and Tai tribes took
ba'it at Marwan's hands. After the bay'at, Marwan leading his
supporters moved towards Marj Rahat and encamped in front of
Dahhak bin Qais. Marwan had 13,000 warriors while Dahhak had
gathered four times more fighters. Both the armies set the right and
left flanks in proper position and started a series of attacks. It
continued for twenty days without any decisive battle being fought.
At last, Obaidullah bin Zeyad drew Marwan' s attention to the small
number of their army and advised him that they should attack them at
night. As both the armies had been forming normal battle lines and
neither side seemed ready to launch a night attack, Dahhak and his
soldiers were thoughtless and unconcerned. Furthermore, Marwan,
during the day had sent a proposal of peace and requested them to
stop fighting and no one should attack the other while the proposal of
peace and terms was being negotiated. Therefore, the fighting had
stopped. When the night came, preparations were a foot for the night
attack in accordance with Ibn Zeyad's plan while Dahhak and his
soldiers, being completely free from military duties, were relaxed or
asleep. After midnight, Marwan's forces attacked from different
flanks. The sudden attack resulted in the death of eighty leaders of
Banu Qais and six hundred men of Banu Sulaim. Dahhak bin Qais was
also killed and the rest fled where they could .
The fight in reality was a fight between Banu Kalb and Banu Qais.
There had been a rivalry bet½'.een them since the days of ignorance.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

103

Islam made them forget their ancient feuds and Amir Muawiya 11 i,r"J
~ made use of them intelligently and kept the old rivalry repressed.
He had Yazid married into Banu Kalb so that he might continue to get
their support. Banu Qais out numbered Banu Kalb and so special care
was also taken to entertain and keep them in good humor. These two
tribes were regarded as the greatest powers in Syria. Just as Umar bin
Khattab's death saw the revival of the old enmity between Banu
Umayyah and Banu Hashim, similarly Amir Muawiya's death
brought to life the old forgotten rivalry between Banu Qais and Banu
Kalb. And the battle of Marj Rahat transformed the rivalry into a
durable and permanent enmity and caused an irreparable damage to
the cause of Islam in the Islamic world.
Following Muawiya bin Yazid's death, rivalries and differences of
opinions between Banu Qais and Banu Kalb began to appear
regarding the choice of the caliph in Damascus, Marwan bin Hakam
seeing that Iraq, Egypt and a big part of Syria had already recognized
Abdullah bin Zubair, made up his mind to leave Damascus, go to
Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 <.r" J in Makkah and take bay' at at his hands
and avoid deferring the matter of recognizing his caliphate. When the
uproar among the people in the central mosque in Damascus
occurred, Marwan bin Hakam became quite hopeless of Banu
Umayyah regaining the caliphate and he had packed his belongings to
undertake the journey to Makkah. With the arrival of Obaidullah bin
Zeyad in Damascus and his becoming aware of Marwan' s intention,
ibn Zeyad insisted on Marwan canceling his departure. It was the
result of his efforts that bay'at for the caliphate of Marwan was taken
and it was his strategy that led to the death of Dahhak bin Qais and
the defeat of Banu Qais at Marj Rahat.
After the victory at Marj Rahat, Marwan came to Damascus and
stayed in Amir Muawiya's palace. Immediately after his arrival
there he, in a~cordance with Ibn Zeyad's counsel, married Khalid
bin Yazid's mother in order to win the support of Banu Kalb and be
free from the danger of Khalid bin Yazid's succession. Then he
advanced to Palestine and Egypt and in the early days of 65 A.H.
defeated all the followers of Abdullah bin Zubair, he either killed or
banished them.

104

History of Islam

Abdullah bin Zubair = .111 <?J committed a gross mistake in this case
by not taking advantage of the favorable situations and events in Syria
and failing to send reinforcements to his followers in time. He
instructed his brother Musab bin Zubair = .'i.1 <?J to invade Syria but
by that time the opportunity had already slipped through their fingers
and hopes had already been shattered and hearts lost.

The Battle of Tawwabeen (pendents)
It has been mentioned earlier that in Ramadan 64 A.H. Abdullah bin
Yazid Ansari became the administrator of Kufa on behalf of Abdullah
bin Zubair ~ and that during the same time period Mukhtar bin Abu
Obaida came to Kufa. Mukhtar began to incite the people to take
retribution for Husain's blood . They told him that they had already
taken ba'it at Sulaiman bin Sard's hands for this purpose but the
suitable time for action had not yet come. Mukhtar said to them,
"Sulaiman is a man of low spirits. He evades fighting. Imam Husain's
brother Imam Mahdi Mohammad bin Al-Hanifia has sent me here as
his deputf. You should take bay'at at my hands and exact recompense
from his enemies." Hearing this they started taking bay'at for the
Imam with Mukhtar. When Abdullah bin Yazid the governor of Kufa,
received this news, he announced that if Mukhtar and his supporters
wanted to revenge themselves on their enemies for the murder of
Husain '---">- .'i.1 ~ J they should co-operate in this mission otherwise if
they took independent action, he would fight against them and punish
them. The impact of the announcement was that Sulaiman bin Sard
and his followers began to purchase arms openly and became busy
preparing for the battle. On the first of Rabia al-Awwal 65 A.H.
Sulaiman left Kufa and encamped at Nakhila with seventeen
thousand warriors. Abdullah bin Yazid, the governor of Kufa, did not
oppose him. Mukhtar was forming his own group for the same
purpose of revenging the death of Imam Husain= 11 .,?J· Although
Sulaiman harbored the same idea in his heart, Mukhtar expressed it
openly, because of the open expression of his plan a few noblemen of
Kufa instigated Abdullah bin Yazid to ca_tch and imprison Mukhtar,
which he did. Sulaiman along with seventeen thousand warriors
advanced toward the Syrian border on the 5 th of Rabia al-Awwal. At

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

105

the time of his departure, Abdullah bin Sad bin Nufail said to
Sulaiman, "All the killers of Husain = .11 cr"J are assembled here in
Kufa. Where are you going to search for them?" Sulaiman said, "These
are soldiers who were at their chief Ibn Zeyad's command. He is the
real culprit and first we should finish with him. Freed from this task it
will be quite easy to straighten out the rest of the problem." After
leaving Nakhila, Sulaiman's army reached Karbala where they wept
bitterly at the place of Husain's murder and at his grave in which
Imam Husain' s headless corpse was buried. They halted there for a
day and a night and then left. They continued their march and
reached "Ain al Wardah" and encamped there. Hearing of their arrival
Obaidullah bin Zeyad, who was at that time the newly appointed
governor of Mosul and was personally stationed there, gave twelve
thousand soldiers to Haseen bin Numer and sent him to face
Sulaiman. Sulaiman had reached Ain al-Wardah on 21 Jumad alAwwal 65 A.H., after camping there for five days Haseen bin Numer
also arrived at Ain al-Wardah on the 26 th of Jumad al-Awwal. The
fight began on that same day. The Syrians suffered great losses until
the evening but then night intervened and protected them. The next
morning about eight thousand more Syrian soldiers sent by lbn Zeyad
came as reinforcements. That day also saw a fierce battle, which
continued from Salat al-Fajr (dawn prayer) to Maghrib time (sunset)
without yielding any final results. Both the parties passed the night in
hope and fear. In the morning another ten thousand Syrian soldiers
arrived as reinforcements sent by lbn Zeyad to aid Haseen bin
Numer's army. That day the battle continued until the evening,
Sulaiman bin Sard and all the great leaders of Kufa were killed and
only a few surviv~"d. The rest of the leaders took their remaining men
and left the battlefield under the cover of darkness. Haseen did not
pursue them. Sulaiman bin Sard and his associates were known as
Tawwabeen (penitents) meaning that they had committed the crime of
causing Imam Husain= ..i,1<.F"J to be killed by betraying him and then
became penitent and tried to compensate for it. That is why the Battle
of "Ain al-Wardah" is also called the Battle of Tawwabeen. They were
not the trained soldiers of any government but they had gathered
there to kill Ibn Zeyad, the majority of them were sent to their death
and only a few of them returned alive.

History of Islam

The Battle of Khawarij
While at "Ain al-Wardah" the group of Tawwabeen (penitents) were
engaged in fighting, in Basra the Khawarij were making preparations
for battle against the governor of Basra, Abdullah bin Harith who had
been appointed by Abdullah bin Zubair. The Khawarij of Basra and its
vicinity gathered in Dolab at Ahwaz and revolted. Abdullah bin
Harith deputed Muslim bin Obais bin Kareez bin Rabia to humble the
rebels. Taking his soldiers Muslim bin Obais arrived in Dolab to fight
the enemy. The Khawarij had made Nafe bin Arzaq their chief and
commander. In Jummad al-Thani 65 A.H ., Nafe bin Arzaq and
Muslim bin Obais clashed at Dolab. Both the commanders Nafe and
Muslim bin Obais were killed but the battle was not decided in any
sides favor. The army of Basra made Hajjaj Bab their commander and
the Khawarij made Abdullah bin Ahwar Tamimi their chief replacing
Muslim bin Obais and Nafe respectively. When the continuing battle
was still going on in full fury, the commander of the army from Basra,
Hajjaj was killed. They made Harith bin Zaid their commander.
Finally, the Khawarij gained victory and Harith bin Zaid along with
the remaining Basra soldiers moved to Ahwaz fighting and chopping
their way through to escape.
The Khawarij moved towards Basra as victors. When the people of
Basra came to know about the victory of the Khawarij and the
wretched plight of the Basra army, they were shocked. Immediately a
fast messenger communicated the news to Abdullah bin Zubair 11 ~ J
-= in Makkah. Abdullah bin Zubair appointed Muhallab bin Abi Sufra
the governor of Khorasan and dismissed Abdullah bin Harith from
the governorship of Basra and appointed Harith bin Rabia to the post
of the governor of Basra . When Harith bin Rabia assumed his post
Muhallab bin Abi Sufra (one of the noblemen of Basra) wanted to go
to Khorasan, the Khawarij soldiers and the flood of revolt had already
reached near Basra. Harith bin Rabia wanted to make Ahnaf bin Qais
the commander in chief of the army in order to face and stop the
advance of the Khawarij . Almaf said, Muhallab bin Sufra was most
suited to this work. Muhallab said, I am going to Khorasan as
governor but I won't refuse to undertake this mi ssion also provided l

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

107

am given enough money and material for the military expenses as
well as the territories taken from the Khawarij will be declared to be
my property."
Harith bin Rabia accepted his condition and Muhallab, taking twelve
thousand selected warriors from the people of Basra, marched on to
confront the Khawarij. The Khawarij fought a pitched battle and
displayed exemplar bravery and turned their enemies faces several
times. However, Muhallab's personal valor and experience benefited
the people of Basra. The Khawarij were vanquished but they
regrouped themselves and began to fight more carefully. Finally, the
Khawarij, after a few more skirmishes, were defeated and they went
towards Kerman and Isfahan.

The Siege of Qarqisa
You have read earlier that prior to the caliphate of Marwan bin
Hakam, Zafar bin Harith had been ruling over Qansareen. After
Marwan's victory Zafar went to Abdullah bin Zubair = .11 ~ J and
informed him of Marwan's occupation of Egypt. Abdullah bin Zubair
<.......:.<- .11,..?; sent him away as the administrator of Qarqisa, which was a
border district between Syria and Iraq. Marwan after the Battle of Ain
al-Wardah assigned Obaidullah bin Zeyad the task of ejecting Zafar
bin Harith from Qarqisa.
Obaidullah laid siege to Qarqisa. Zafar bin Harith defended with
great courage and determination . The siege and its defense prolonged
until Obaidullah bin Zeyad received the news of Marwan's death and
becoming discouraged about the success of the siege lifted it and
returned to Damascus.

Succession of Marwan's sons
Having ordered Obaidullah bin Zeyad to lay siege to Qarqisa,
Marwan bin Hakam put all his effort into arranging the caliphate to
go to his sons Abdul Malik and Abdul Aziz. He publicized the idea
that Amr bin Sayeed bin Aas, who according to the original agreement
that brought Marwan to the caliphate would be second in line after
Khalid bin Yazid, said, "I will not allow Khalid bin Yazid to succeed

108

History of Islam

Marwan after his death rather I will take bay'at from the people for my
own caliphate". The publicity made the people gossip. Taking advantage
of this manufactured opportunity, Marwan by tempting and deceiving
Hassan bin Malik Kalbi who was Khalid bin Yazid's greatest supporter,
persuaded him to make the proposal that after Marwan, Abdul Malik
bin Marwan and then Abdul Aziz bin Marwan be made caliph.
Hassan bin Malik stood up in front of the general public in the central
mosque of Damascus and said, "We have been hearing that the people
will certainly quarrel about the matter of the caliphate after the Amir
al-Muminin Marwan. In order to ward off this danger I put before you
a proposal. I hope the Amir al-Muminin and the general Muslims will
agree to it. The proposal is this that Amir al-Muminin nominate his
sons Abdul Malik and after him, Abdul Aziz for the caliphate and
take bay'at from the people for this. No one dared to oppose or
contradict this proposal and immediately the people took bay'at for the
succession of Abdul Malik and Abdul Aziz.

Death of Marwan bin Hakam
The ba'it was against Khalid bin Yazid but all his supporters had
already been won over by Marwan, he felt shocked and disappointed
but he could do nothing about it. After this political victory, Marwan
continued to damage Khalid bin Yazid's influence and popularity and
went to the extent of humiliating and degrading him. However, even
this failed to satisfy Marwan, who still considered Khalid as a possible
threat to his political strategy, and he began planning his murder.
Khalid complained to his mother, who was, Marwan's wife that
Marwan was planing to murder him. His mother said, "Keep quiet I
will take revenge on Marwan before he accomplishes it." She therefore
persuaded four or five of her slave girls to murder him. Marwan came
to the palace at night and went to bed. The girls in obedience to the
order of Khalid's mother, stuffed linen into his mouth to suppress his
outcries and strangled him to death. This happened in Ramadan 65
A.H. That same day the people took ba'it for Abdul Malik's caliphate
in Damascus. Abdul Malik killed Khalid's mother in retaliation for
Marwan's murder. Marwan was 63 at the time of his death. He had
ruled for only nine and a half months.

Abdullah bin Zubair
Abdullah bin Zubair -= 11 ,?J and his situation and the circumstances
of his caliphate have been recorded in the previous pages. As Marwan
bin Hakam's death occurred during Abdullah binZubair's caliphate
and as his caliphate continued even after Marwan's death, we thought
it proper that Marwan bin Hakam's situation and circumstances be
recorded after those of Yazid bin Muawiya and Muawiya bin Yazid to
be followed finally by those of Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 ,?J· Abdul
Malik succeeded to the throne and since the period of his rule and
caliphate lasted even after that of Abdullah bin Zubair, the prevailing
conditions and circumstances of his reign entitled Abdul Malik will
follow that of Abdullah bin Zubair's. The period that began with the
disaster at Karbala is as difficult to present as the period between 30 to
40 A.H . We are about to study a very dangerous age and in recording
it, the chronology is difficult to maintain. The conditions are so
complicated and confused that even if they are categorized outside of
their chronological order it is not feasible to make them fit into a
simple presentation. Even with these difficulties we have tried in
comparison to other histories that this book should have more order
and the readers should not feel over burdened mentally and so the
reflection on the reality of these events should establish itself with
more understanding in their minds.

Early life and Habits
His genealogical table is as follows : Abdullah bin Zubair bin Awwam
bin Khuwailid bin Asad bin Abdul Uzza bin Qussai. His familiar
name is Abu Khubaib (Editors note: In Arabic it is endearing to refer
to a man by the title of "father of" followed by the name of his first
son. Therefore, the Prophet ,i is called Abul Qasim and Ali= 11 ,?J is
known as Abul Hasan. This is also applicable to a woman and she is
entitled "mother of" and the name of her first son. In Arabic, this is
known as kunya and has no English equivalent). Himself a Sahabi
(companion of the Prophet ~ ) he is a Sahabi's son. His father Zubair
bin Awwam is counted among the Ashrat Mubashshireen (Literally:
"The ten given good news," meaning ten companions of the Prophet

110

History of Islam

~

who were given the good news that they would go to Paradise).
His mother Asma was Abu Bakr Siddiq's daughter and Aysha
Siddiqa's sister. His grand mother was Safia who was the Prophet's
paternal aunt.
Abdullah bin Zubair was born one year and 8 months after the
Prophet ~ emigrated to Madinah. He was the first child born to a
Muhajir (those who emigrated to Madinah) in Madinah Munawwara.
His birth was highly celebrated by the emigrants because when the
Jews saw that no child was born to an emigrant in Madinah for a long
time, they publicized the idea that they had cast a spell over them and
therefore no child could be born to the emigrants. That was why the
Muslims were very joyous when he was born and it also caused as
much grief, humiliation and shame to the Jews. He was taken to the
Prophet ~ immediately after his birth. He~ chewed a date and put a
little in baby Abdullah's mouth.
Abdullah bin Zubair .....__,, :iii ~ J used to observe fast very often and
would remain engaged in prayer. Sometimes he stood up in prayer
and remained in that position for the whole night; sometimes he
remained in ruku (bowing) for the whole night and sometimes he
spent the whole night in sujud (prostration) . He helped the needy
especially his relatives. He was very brave and was a great general.
His horsemanship was exemplar and a matter of pride among the
Quraish. He was a man of great perseverance and stood like rock in
the face of difficulties. He was a fine orator with a deep voice. His
voice echoed and resonated as if he was in the mountains.
Omar bin Qais says, Abdullah bin Zubair = .l>I ..?J had one hundred
slaves who spoke a hundred different languages and he talked to each
of them in their own language. Whenever anybody saw him do
some religious deed, the observer would gather the impression that
worldly desires could not have entered his heart even for a fraction of
a second.
One day Abdullah Asadi called on Abdullah bin Zubair = .;;,1 ..?J and
said to him, "You and I are related to each other through such and
such genealogy. Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 ..?J said, yes, you are right.
But if you ponder, you will conclude that the whole of mankind is

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

111

interrelated because all of us have descended from Adam and Eve.
Abdullah Asadi said, my funds have run short and I have no money
to spend. Abdullah bin Zubair ~ 11 ~ J said, I did not stand as a
guarantee to your funds. Asadi said my camel is dying of cold.
Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 .,,;,j said, take it to some warm place and put
some woolen cloth or a blanket on it. Asadi said I did not come to you
to take counsel but to beg something. Accursed be the camel, which
brought me to you. Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 .,,;,) said, curse the rider
of this camel too.

Important Events of lbn Zubair's Caliphate
Abdullah bin Zubair = 11 .,,;, j had been reigning in Makkah since Amir
Muawiya's death. He never allowed Yazid's rule to be established in
Makkah during Yazid's regime. He took bay'at for the caliphate after
Yazid's death and in a short time he was recognized as caliph by the
whole Islamic world except for a few places in Syria. During that
period, he did not take correct stock of the situation in Syria, which
were in his favor but he failed to capitalize on them. He committed a
mistake by under estiMoting Banu Umayyah's power and popularity,
which had been established since Amir Muawiya's times in Syria.
Had he correctly deduced the situation concerning Banu Qais's and
Banu Kalab' s dissensions and rivalries and his own popularity is Syria
he would have undertaken a journey to Syria. There is a high
probability that the journey would have proved as fruitful as Umar
bin Khattab 's journey to Syria for the Islamic world. In that case,
Marwan's caliphate and the restoration of Banu Umayyah's influence
and power would not have taken place. If he had made Madinah his
capital instead of Makkah and came to Madinah immediately after
Yazid's death, he would not have allowed Syria to slip through his
fingers owing to its proximity it would have been easier to control. Had
he done this, he could have prevented Dahhak bin Qais, Zafar bin
Harith, Noman bin Basher and Abdur Rahman bin Jehdam from being
vanquished. If these people had received a little support and help from
him they were not the type of people who would retreat and accept
defeat at any cost. The consequence of that error of misunderstanding
was that Egypt and Syria coupled with Palestine went out of his control
and Marwan founded the caliphate for his descendents.

112

History of Islam

Mukhtar's Mischief
Mukhtar bin Abi Ubaid bin Masood Thagfi has been mentioned in
previous pages. When Sulaiman bin Sard appeared with the group of
Tawwabeen to take revenge for Husain's murder, the governor of
Kufa made him captive in order to maintain law and order due to his
loud cries for revenge. When the remainder of the Tawwabeen
returned to Kufa, Mukhtar sent a letter expressing his sense of sorrow
to them.
" Don't be sad and rest assured that if I remain alive, I will take
revenge for all of your martyred soldiers and Husain's death. I wi:>n't
spare even a single killer and will cause such bloodshed that the
people will be reminded of Bukht Nassr's times and how he killed
Banu Israel. If there is anybody alive who wants to avenge Husain's
death he should make a pact with me for this mission.
The letter was read by Rafe bin Shaddad, Muthanna bin Makhriba
Abdi, Sad bin Hudaifa bin Yaman, Yazid bin Anas, Ahmar bin Sumait
Himsi, Abdullah bin Shaddad Bajali, and Abdullah bin Kamil who
were all from the group of Tawwabeen. They were beside themselves
with joy that there was still a soul alive who had so much enthusiasm
and dedication concerning Husain's death. Rafe bin Shaddad, therefore took four or five persons with him and visited the prision. Having
gotten permission, he saw Mukhtar and told him that they would
secure his release after breaking open the jail. Mukhtar said, No don't
bother. I shall be free whenever I want the governor of Kufa himself
will set me free. The time has not come. Wait for a few days more.
Mukhtar had sent a letter to Abdullah bin Umar l....j..;,- .:;,1 ,?; through a
messenger from the jail before the vanquished Tawwabeen returned.
The letter stated. "I have been imprisoned by the governor of Kufa,
Abdullah bin Yazid. Would you please write a letter of
recommendation to him. I have been wronged. ABah will reward you
for it." Mukhtar was sure that Abdullah bin Umar l....j..;,- .:.1 <?~ would
certainly recommend him and that he would be released. Concealing
that reality, he spoke to Rafe about his release in such a way as to
impress on him that he had spritual powers. After a few days

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

113

Abdullah bin Umar letter was received by Abdullah bin Yazid, and
he, in respect to this letter, called Mukhtar from the jail and said, "I
release you on the condition that you do not create any mischief in
Kufa and keep yourself confined to your house. Mukhtar agreed and
went to his house. Husain's supporters attributed his release to his
miracle and began to visit him with great respect and faith. The
faithful persons visited him secretly. A few days later Abdullah bin
Zubair ~ 11 c.r" J dismissed Abdullah bin Yazid and sent Abdullah bin
Moti to Kufa as governor. Abdullah bin Moti arrived in Kufa on 25
Ramadan 66 A.H. Mukhtar also attributed the rise and fall of the
governors to his miraculous power and after the departure of the old
governor from Kufa, broke the restrictions imposed upon him and
began to live more freely, more and more people began to visit him
and the number of his followers started increasing greatly. Abdullah
bin Moti had appointed Ayas bin Abi Mudarib as the city Magistrate.
One day Ayas said to Moti, the governor of Kufa, Mukhtar's followers
have become dangerous and powerful. I am afraid that he might rise
against you. You had better put him in prison as before.
Abdullah bin Moti sent Mukhtar's uncle Zaid bin Masood Thaqfi
along with Husain bin Rafe Azdi to Mukhtar asking him to come to
him because he wanted to have an important talk with him. Both o_f
them went to Mukhtar and conveyed the governor's message. He at
once put on his clothes and was getting ready to leave when Zaid read
the verse of the Qur' an,
"And when the disbelieves plotted against you to imprision
you, or to kill you, or to get you out." (8:30)
No sooner had Mukhtar heard the verse than he at once made out
what Zaid meant. He said, bring me a blanket. I am feeling cold. He
covered himself with his blanket and laid down. Then addressing
Husain bin Rafe he said "See I was ready to leave. But what can I do?
I've had a sudden attack of sickness. Now I cannot move. Please
narrate to the Amir the condition in which you found me. When I get
well tomorrow morning, I shall comply with his order. Both of them
left, on the way Husain bin Rafe said to Zaid, you read that verse so
that Mukhtar would not go to the Amir otherwise he was ready to go.

114

History of Islam

He stopped because you wanted him to stop. He simply invented an
excuse, commenting thus Husain said to Zaid, rest assured, I won't
mention it to Abdullah bin Moti because I may get some benefit from
Mukhtar. Both wenf to Abdullah bin Moti and said to him, Mukhtar
was seriously ill. We have seen him with our eyes and he is unable to
come here. Allah willing he will be coming tomorrow.
No sooner had Zaid and Husain gone than Mukhtar called a select
few of his influential faithful followers and told them that they should
not delay and should not wait any more they should rise in revolt at
once. They said we are obedient to you. We are ready to abide by your
decision but we should be given time for a week so that we may make
our weapons ready and in order to finish our preparations for war.
Mukhtar said that he did not expect Abdullah to grant him time for a
week. Sad bin Abi Sad said, don't worry if Abdullah calls and
imprisons you, we will have you released from the jail easily. Hearing
that Mukhtar kept quite. They took him to an unknown place and hid
him there. Then ~ad bin Abi Sad said to the like minded people we
should make inquires before we revolt whether Mohammad bin
Hanafia has really made Mukhtar his deputy for this work or not. If
he is really deputed for taking bay'at on behalf of Mohammad bin
Hanafia, we should rise in revolt under his command without any
hesitation and if Mohammad bin Hanafia has not entrusted him with
this task and he just wants to trick us, we should not have anything to
do with him. Sad bin Abi Sad therefore took three or four persons
with him and immediately left for Madinah. Having called on
Mohammad bin Hanafia, they asked and were told in confirMotion
that he had really given Mukhtar the permission to avenge Husain's
death. After the confirMotion Sad bin Abi Sad came to Kufa with his
supporters and briefed the people there. When they heard that, they
got ready to take bay'at with Mukhtar and obey him.
When Mukhtar was informed that he was proved right, he was very
pleased. Their doubts were thus dispelled. He instructed them to
include in the group Ibrahim bin Malik bin Ushtur, one of the
noblemen of Kufa, to ensure success of the mission. Amir bin
Shurahbil, one of the followers of Mukhtar, went to Ibrahim bin Malik
and said to him that during Ali bin Abi Talib's regime your father

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

115

achieved remarkable feats. The people have decided to demand
compensation for Husain's death and a good number of people have
agreed to it, you should be of the first of those to participate in it.
Ibrahim said that he could take part in it provided they made him
their leader, Amir bin Shurahbil said, Mohammad bin Hanafia is in
fact our Imam and he has made Mukhtar his representative. That's
why we have taken bay'at at Mukhtar's hands. Ibrahim said that he
himself would see Mukhtar. Amir bin Shurahbil returned and
acquainted Mukhtar with all the facts. The next day Mukhtar took
fifteen men with him and called on Ibrahim bin Malik who was sitting
on his prayer mat at the time. Mukhtar turned to him and said your
father was a man of reputation who was among the supporters of
Ali bin Abi Talib. We consider you also to belong to our group and
our group to belong to you. Imam Mahdi Mohammad bin Al-Hanafia
has sent me as his deputy. You should take bay'at at my hands and I
promise that on getting success, you will be given the post of your
choice. The associates attested to the promise. Ibrahim at once stood
up from his mat and made Mukhtar sit in his place and took bay'at
at his hands. Mukhtar returned after the bay'at. The next night on
Rabia al-Awwal 14, 66 A.H. Mukhtar sent his man to Ibrahim with
the message, "I have made up my mind to revolt. You too should
come to me along with your group." Ibrahim's men kept assembling
until midnight.
Through his intelligence network Ayas bin Mudarib was informed
that a rebellion would break out that night. He in turn informed
Abdullah bin Moti and asked him about the right way to curb it. He
counseled him saying, Kufa has seven districts, you should depute a
body of five hundred soldiers in each district. If anybody is seen out
doors, he should be either arrested or killed. This proposal was duly
executed. A chief was sent to each district in order to prevent the
people from assembling on the roads and paths. It was by sheer
chance that when Ibrahim was on his way to Mukhtar with his men
that he happened to confront Ayas bin Mudarib. Both sides attacked
each other and Ayas bin Mudarib was killed by Ibrahim. On the other
side, about four thousand supporters had collected around Mukhtar's
house. They had to confront a second division of the government

116

History of Islam

army. From one side Ibrahim reached Mukhtar's house fighting and
pushing and from the other side came the soldiers from all the other
districts. They all began to fight in front of Mukhtar's house. Ibrahim
defeated the government army and forced them to retreat. Abdullah
bin Moti arrived with more fresh troops. Now Ibrahim and Mukhtar
pushed Abdullah bin Moh into Dar-ul-Emarat (the headquarters of
the Amir), and then Abdullah bin Moti pushed them back and out of
Kufa. The fight continued throughout the night. With the prolongation
of the fight, Mukhtar's supporters kept increasing as new people kept
coming and joining. Finally, Abdullah bin Moti was forced to remain
besieged in his headquarters, Mukhtar continued the siege for three
days. The number of people inside the headquarters of the Amir was
so many that the accommodations were insufficient and foodstuff was
also in short supply. Abdullah bin Moti went out by a hidden tunnel
and concealed himself in Abu Musa Ashari's house. The rest asked for
peace and opened the gates of governor's house. Mukhtar took
possession of the headquarters and the treasury and distributed a
large amount of money among his supporters. The inhabitants of Kufa
then assembled at the central mosque. Mukhtar delivered a sermon
and coaxed them to recognize Mohammad bin Hanafi's leadership.
Consequently, they pledged to follow the Book (Qur'an) and Sunnah
(traditions of the Prophet ~ ) and sympathize with the descendants of
the Prophet *'· Mukhtar also promised to treat them courteously. After
the collective bay'at, he came to know that Abdullah bin Moti was
hiding in Abu Musa Ashari's house. He sent one hundred thousand
dirhams to him and gave him a message, I have been informed that
for want of provision for the journey you are staying at Abu Musa' s
house please accept this one hundred thousand dirhams pack up your
belonging and leave Kufa within three days.
Abdullah bin Moti was highly ashamed and so he did not go to
Makkah. He went to Basra instead. At the time when Sulaiman bin
Sard's supporters came to Basra after their defeat there was a man
named Muthanna bin Makhrama Abdi of Basra among them. After
going through Mukhtar's letter they visited the jail to see him. This
has been mentioned earlier. Muthanna at once took bay'at at
Mukhtar's hands and Mukhtar sent him to Basra with the instructions

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

117

to take ba' it from the supporters of Ali bin Abi Talib= 11 .,?J on his
behalf and increase the number of his men and rev'olt in Basra when
he began the revolt in Kufa. Muthanna therefore began to take ba'it
from the people secretly and built up a group with him.
When Mukhtar intended to revolt in Kufa, he had informed
Muthanna in Basra who followed suit on the same date. At the time,
Basra was governed by Harith bin Abi Rabia on behalf of Abdullah
bin Zubair '----'>- 11 ~ J · Harith did not let the rebels see their plans
materialized. He besieged them in the,ir district and expelled them out
of Basra . They left Basra and went to Mukhtar in Kufa. In this way,
Basra was saved but Kufa went out of the control of Abdullah bin
Zubair '----'>- 11~ J · Mukhtar established · his domination in Kufa and
befriended its noblemen. He made a few flags, signifying different
future campaigns. He was plarming to occupy others cities of the
Islamic territories. He handed a few flags over to Abdullah bin Harith
bin Ushtur and sent him to Armenia, he gave flags to other
commanders to occupy other cities of the Islamic territories. He
handed a flag over to Mohammad bin Umair bin Otarid and sent him
to Azerbaijan, he gave yet another to Abdur Rahman bin Qais and
sent him to Mosil followed by one to Ishaq bin Masood to take
Madayen and another to Sad bin Hudaifa bin Yaman to capture
Halwan. Abdullah bin Kami! and Shuraih were made the city
magistrate and judge of Kufa respectively. His officers met with
success everywhere with the result that the people recognized his
reign and took ba'it. Only Mosil could not be brought under control
by Abdur Rahman bin Sayeed because there Obaidullah bin Zeyad
was deputed governor br Abdul Malik bin Marwan. Abdur Rahman
halted at Takrait instead of Mosil and sent the inforMotion to
Mukhtar. He deputed Yazid bin Anas for the expedition and giving
him three thousand horsemen sent him towards Mosil. When
Obaidullah bin Zeyad heard the news of Yazid bin Anas' arrival, he
sent Rabia bin Mukhtar Ghanwi to fight him. There wa s a
confrontation between the two at Babilon 9 Thul Hijja 66 A.H. Rabia
was killed and the Syrian army suffered defeat. When the vanquished
Syrian soldiers were retreating, Abdullah bin Jumla Khash' ami was
seen coming with three thousand soldiers that Obaidullah bin Zeyad
had sent to help Rabia. Abdullah stopped them, took them with him

118

History of Islam

and the next day, 10 Thul Hijja on Id-ul-Adha day attacked the army
from Kufa . That battle also ended in victory for the soldiers from Kufa
and the defeat of the Syrians. The victors captured several thousand
Syrians and killed them by the order of Yazid bin Anas and that same
evening Yazid bin Anas who had been ill died, but not before making
Warqa bin Azib the supreme commander of the army.
The next day Warga was informed by his spies that Obaidullah bin
Zeyad himself was coming to wage battle. As soon as he heard his
name, Warga left Babil and came to Iraq, halted and wrote to Mukhtar,
"Because J had a very small army, I had to retreat" . That news made the
authorities of Kufa condemn Warga because how could he adopt the
strategy of a defeated army after having been victorious. Mukhtar gave
Ibrahim bin Malik bin Ushtur seven thousand troops from Kufa and
ordered him to take all the soldiers that had been under the command of
Yazid bin Anas and put them under his own command.
After Ibrahim' s departure, some of the people of Kufa called on
Sheeth bin Rabi and complained that Mukhtar did not honor them
rather misappropriated and violated their rights. Sheeth told them
that he would talk to Mukhtar and hear his statement on this matter.
When he went to Mukhtar, he was told, I am ready to do every duty
in consultation with the people of Kufa and let them share in the booty
provided they agree that they will fight Banu Umayyah and Abdullah
bin Zubair ~ 11 ~ ; until their power in reduced to nothing. Sheeth
said that he would first talk to those who had sent him. Now in Kufa
there were people who had taken bay'at at Mukhtar's hands long
before he came to power. They were all his allies and shared his views
and faith and he made great allowances for them. Similarly, there
were those who had simply taken bay'at for the sake of obedience by
recognizing his rule. They did not share his opinion and were not in
favor of taking revenge for Husain's blood . It was they who had
grievances against Mukhtar. Therefore, at Sheeth's return they staged
a demonstration against Mukhtar and reaching governor's house (at
this time Mukhtar's headquarters) they said to him, we dismiss you.
Give up your rule because you are not the deputy and caliph of
Mohammad bin Hanafia." Mukhtar acted discreetly and foresightedly
and tried to make them understand, saying, I don't want to be strict
with you.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

119

I forgave you for killing Husain (= .JJ1 ._,..;,~) and you will be given all
concessions. We are in a state of war with Banu Umayyah at the
moment. You must keep away from creating mischief or it will not be
good for you. Go and think over it deeply because the work for which
you have made up your mind to do will have disastrous
consequences."
Their chiefs agreed to Mukhtar's suggestions at the time and promised
to think it over. Their reason for agreeing was to allow Ibrahim bin
Malik enough time to get as far away from Kufa as possible so that he
would not be a danger to them. Mukhtar also was thinking of Ibrahim
and felt his helplessness in Ibrahim's absence, he therefore sent a fast
camel-rider to Ibrahim with the message to come back to Kufa in the
shortest possible time. He fortified the Amir's headquarters and
settled in there firmly. The people laid siege to it the next day. The
third day saw Ibrahim returning to Kufa with his army. He started
killing those who rose against Mukhtar. In short, there remained not
even a single house in Kufa, which had not lost one, two or more
persons. Mukhtar assembled all the people and had a list prepared
that contained the names of those who were present in Ibn Zeyad's
army at the time of Husain's murder or \<\'ho took part in Karbala's
disaster in one way or the other. 'Amr bin · Sad and Shimr DhulJaushan were also arrested and put to death. 'Amr bin Sa' d received a
promise of safety from Mukhtar, but Mukhtar violated his pledge and
had him beheaded . His son Hafs bin Amr stayed in Mukhtar' s
company. When Amr bin Sad's head was brought to the court,
Mukhtar said to Hafs, "Do you recognize whose head it is?" Hafs said,
"Yes. I do and after this my life is bereft of pleasure." Mukhtar
ordered his head to be chopped off immediately, and his order was
carried out. In brief, the series of arrests and killings continued for
several days. The people were brought after being arrested in their
houses and were executed. Mukhtar sent Amr bin Sad' s and Shimr's
heads to Muhammad bin Hanafia in Madinah.
Mukhtar was a very prudent and clever man. Having occupied Kufa,
he wrote a letter to Abdullah bin Zubair (= .JJ1_,.;>;) stating: "I am at the
Amir's headquarters in Kufa. I obey you and recognize your caliphate
from the core of my heart. Please make me the Governor of Kufa."

120

History of Islam

Abdullah bin Zubair (-= .;;,1 er") at once realized that he wanted to come
into power and this was a ruse to deceive him and keep him
unmindful of his seditious activities. He decided to test Mukhtar's
obedience so he sent Amr bin Abdur Rahman bin Harith bin Hisham
Makhzumi to Kufa with the written command of Amr's governorship
of Kufa. When Mukhtar came to know of it, he sent Zaid bin Qodama
with five hundred cavalry and seventy thousand dirhams to stop Amr
bin Abdur Rahman on the way and send him back giving him the
money as compensation. He further instructed that in case he refused
he -should be arrested. Amr bin Abdur Rahman at first refused to
accept it but when he saw the strong army of five hundred, he thought
it wiser and expedient to accept it. He therefore left for Basra with the
money. Abdullah bin Moti had also gone there and now Amr bin
Abdur Rahman joined him there, the governor of Basra at the time
was Harith bin Abu Rabia.

Mukhtar's claim to Prophethood and Ali's chair
When Ali (= ..'i,1cr".J) lived in Kufa, he had a specific chair that he used
to sit on and often issued orders from that seat. His sister's son named
Jadah bin Hubairah, the son of Umm Hani bint Abu Talib, lived in
Kufa and the chair in question was in his possession. Having
established himself as the ruler in Kufa, Mukhtar tried to take
possession of this chair. Jadah said to him, "Please give me a week's
time so that I may find it and give it to you." Mukhtar said, "I could
never give you more than three days time. If you fail to bring me the
chair within the stipulated time, I will deal harshly with you."
In Jadah's district there lived a dealer of oil. He had a similar chair
with him. Jadah purchased it from him and took it home secretly. He
cleaned it, wrapped it in a cover and took it to Mukhtar with great
formality and care. Mukhtar accepted the chair, rewarded him well,
kissed it, and put it in front of him and performed the prayer. Then he
convened a meeting of his followers and said to them, "Just as Allah
made a chest the source of victory and prosperity for the children of
Israel (Editors note: This is a reference to the Ark of the Covenant),
similarly He made this chair a symbol for the followers of Ali (..'i,1 -r°"
~). From this day forward we will become victorious everywhere."

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

121

His followers rubbed their eyes on it, kissed it, and bowed their heads
before it. Then he ordered a cabinet to be made for the chair. An
attractive cabinet with a silver lock containing the chair and with
guards assigned for its protection was put in the Grand Mosque in
Kufa. Whoever went there for prayer kissed it. Much before his
coming to power in Kufa, Mukhtar had started spreading his net of
deceit and enslaving the masses with his supposed extraordinary
spiritual powers. After gaining power in Kufa, his cunningness in this
way was easier to perpetrate. Slowly and gradually, he was moving in
a direction to make a claim to Prophethood.
When Mukhtar captured Kufa and wrote to Abdullah bin Zubair (<.,>"'J
~ .11), Abdul Malik bin Marwan approximately during the s.ame
period gave an army to Abdul Malik bin Harith bin Hakam bin Abul
Aas and sent him to Wadi-ul-Qara for a few days. It was to be the first
invasion on Abdullah bin Zubair (~ .11 ~;) by _Abdul Malik bin
Marwan. Having heard the news of the invasion, Mukhtar wrote a
second letter to Abdullah bin Zubair (= .11 ,.,-;J. "If you want I shall
send an army from Kufa for your support." Abdullah bin Zubair C,,°"'J
~ .&1) answered: "If you send an army as an obedient person, send it
towards Wadi-ul-Qara". Mukhtar handed over a three thousand man
army to Shurahbil bin Wars Hamdani with the instructions that he
should go directly to Madinah, write to him about the state of affairs
there and comply with the orders which he would send to him later.
His purpose was to please Muhammad bin Hanafia by sending an
army to Madinah, which would not be objected to by Abdullah bin
Zubair (= .11 <.,>"'J) and which would also enhance his influence among
Ali's supporters.
Abdullah bin Zubair (~ 11 ~;) understood these clever ploys by
Mukhtar. When he answered Mukhtar's letter Abdullah bin Zubair
('-'-'" .&1 ~ ;) assigned to Abbas bin Saha! two thousand soldiers
instructing him that if Mukhtar sent an army from Kufa, it should first
be ascertained whether it was coming as an ally or as rebe l forces. If
obedient, it should be used; if not, it should be sent back. If it refused
to go back, it should be faced. Abbas and Shurahbil met at Raqeem.
Abbas said to him, "Accompany us to .Wadi-ul-Qara to face the
enemy." Shurahbil said, "We have been ordered to go directly to
0

122

History of Islam

Madinah. There we shall await another order and then we will be able
to move." Abbas first entertained the Kufans with delicacies. And
then as punishment for refusal, he launched an attack on them and
compelled Mukhtar' s three thousand men with his two thousand men,
he killed seventy of them and sent the remainder back to Kufa.
Mukhtar took advantage of it and wrote a letter to Muhammad bin
Hanafia complaining against Abdullah bin Zubair (= .'iii i,," J)- "He did
not let my army reach you, which I had sent in your support. Now it is
important that you send your cl}ief confidante to me so that I may
send a strong army with him and the people will be honored and
graced with the sight of your messenger." Muhammad bin Hanafia
replied expediently, "I am aware of your love of truth. You should
leave me alone in peace and avoid shedding the blood of Allah's
creatures. Had I been desirous of ruling and becoming a leader, I
would have rallied around me more people than you have. However,
I have dismissed and abandoned all my supporters and the final
decision rests with Allah."

Obaidullah bin Zeyad was killed
It has already been mentioned that the Kufans defeated the Syrians on
Eid al-Adha day in 66 A.H. but the Kufqn general had retreated as
soon as he was informed of the advance of Ibn Zeyad . Hearing that
news, Mukhtar had sent his commander in chief, Ibrahim bin Malik
bin Ushtur with seven thousand soldiers but as mentioned Ibrahim
had to return to Kufa. People were massacred in large numbers in
Kufa and all those who were opposed to Ali's supporters, were
completely crushed, which averted and prevented such dangers in the
future. Having been relieved of that situation, Mukhtar sent Ibrahim
bin Malik from Kufa on an expedition to confront Ibn Zeyad on 22
Dhul-Hijjah 66 A.H. At this time Kufa was in no danger of any
uprising, as the people were extremely terrified, the influential and
important leaders were sent along with Ibrahim. The cabinet
containing the chair was also dispatched. The purpose was to instill
confidence in the ~rmy of its victory in advance.

Ibrahim bin Malik crossed the Iraqi border with terrific speed and
entered Mosil where Obaidullah bin Zeyad was governing on behalf

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Pliase)

123

of Abdul Malik bin Marwan. Hearing of the approaching army,
Obaidullah left Mosil and both the armies encamped at a place
adjacent to the Khazir. After passing the night and performing Salat
al-Fajr (the pre-dawn prayer), they attacked each other. It was a
bloody battle. Signs of defeat were visible on the Kufan side but
Ibrahim bin Malik' s courage and perseverance made the Kufans stand
firmly. The commanders of both sides displayed feats of valor but
ultimately the Syrians suffered defeat and their general Obaidullah
bin Zeyad was killed. Along with him the next great Syrian chief,
Haseen bin Numer, was also killed by Sharik binJadid Taghlibi. When
the fight was over and the Syrians were either killed or driven away,
Ibrahim bin Malik said to them, "I have killed a man near the canal
under the flag whose clothes give off the scent of musk. My sword has
cut him into two parts. Go and see who he was." They went there and
found that it was Obaidullah bin Zeyad. His head was cut off and the
body was consigned to flames. Along with the celebration of victory
Obaidullah bin Zeyad's head was also sent to Mukhtar in Kufa.

Najdeh bin Amir Captures Yamamah
Najdeh bin Amir bin Abdullah bin Sad bin Mufreh had started an
uprising in the adjoining areas of Yamamah in 65A.H. He wisely did
not accept the command of his men rather he entrusted one of his
group called Abu Talut with the task. That group had not acquired
any significance by 65 A.H. except for ma½ing night attacks on
caravans and making the roads dangerous for travelers. In 66 A.H.,
they became so powerful that they began to loot and annihilate cities.
At this point, Najdeh assumed the leadership by removing Abu Talut
and at the end of 66 A.H., he established himself as the permanent
ruler of the place and its adjoining areas. Abdullah bin Zubair (11,.?J
~) could nqt send an army towards Yamamah during that period
because Syria and Iraq were more important to him at the time.
Consequently, Najdeh's rule over Yamamah lasted until 69 or 70 A.H.

Preparation for the Invasion on Kufa
Abdullah bin Zubair ( ~ 11 ...,-"J) was recognized as caliph in 64 A.H.
and in the same year Egypt, Palestine and Syria were excluded from
the jurisdiction of his caliphate and the caliphate of Banu Umayyah

124

History of Islam

was re-established. In 65 A.H., there were uprisings in some provinces
but Abdullah bin Zubair continued to be regarded as caliph and no
other province was lost from under his control. In 66 A.H., both Kufa
and Yamamah went out of his jurisdiction. Mukhtar and Najdeh bin
Amir established their rule in Kufa and Yamamah respectively. Basra
and Persia were controlled by Harith bin Rabia and Muhallab bin Abu
Sofra respectively and the mischief of the Khawarij was crushed
immediately as soon as it raised the specter of revolt. Basra was being
lured and swayed by Mukhtar. Both Abdullah bin Moti, the exGovernor of Kufa, and Amr bin Abdur Rahman, the nominated
Governor of Kufa, were present in Basra. They avoided Abdullah bin
Zubair and their presence in Basra might mean danger to him as their
complicity in some sort of conspiracy could not be ruled out. When
Abdullah bin Zubair (-= .:., c?J) heard that Obaidullah bin Zeyad was
killed by Ibrahim bin Malik, he heaved a sigh of relief and was
relieved of some pressure from the side of the Syrians plus it meant
that Abdul Malik bin Marwan's power had received a set-back and
therefore he could not venture to attack the Hijaz any time soon.
However, the dangers around Basra multiplied many fold because
Mukhtar bin Abu Obaida's attention was likely to be focused on Basra
itself. Because of this he at once removed the Governor of Basra,
Harith bin Rabia and in his place deputed his own brother Mus'ab bin
Zubair (= .:;,, <$"J) as its Governor.
During this time, many people fled from Kufa for fear of Mukhtar and
his revenge and took shelter in Basra. They were those who had an
apprehension they might be killed by Mukhtar in retaliation for
Husain's death. Among the fugitives were Sheeth bin Rabi and
Muhammad bin Al-Ash'ath. Mus'ab bin Zubair (= .'i.i, <$"J) took control
of the government and leadershrp of Basra and began to study and
take stock of the different situations minutely and in detail. The
people from Kufa among whom were some respected and
experienced persons, advised Mus' ab bin Zubair (= 1, <$"J) to invade
Kufa. Mus' ab said, "I have been ordered by Amir-ul-Muminin
Abdullah bin Zubair ("--"' .;;,, ,_,--.,J not to invade K_ufa without taking
Muhallab bin Abu Sofra with me so he should first be called from
Persia." So, Mus'ab wrote a letter to Muhallab and sent it through
Muhammad bin Ash'ath. Seeing Ash'ath, Muhallab said, "Couldn't

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

125

Mus'ab lay his hands on anyone else besides you to be his
messenger"? He said. "I am not a messenger. I have come for my own
selfish end, to narrate to you the conditions prevalent in Kufa. Our
slaves sons have dispossessed us of our assets and houses and the
afflicted ones have sought refuge in Basra and cry for help and rescue
from this catastrophe."
Muhallab handed over the administration of the Persian Province to
his son, Mughira bin Muhallab, and made satisfactory arrangements
for the territory. Then he collected a huge amount of money, material
and troops and marched towards Basra and met Mus'ab bin Zubair
(~ .'i.1 c,-"'; ) there. Abdullah bin Zubair's letter had already reached
Muhallab advising him to see Mus' ab bin Zubair (= 11 IS"';) in Basra
and invade Kufa. When Muhallab hesitated and delayed a bit, Mus'ab
had to send a messenger from Basra to Makkah. Abdullah bin Zubair
(~ .'i.1 c,-"'; ) might have delayed a bit more in launching an attack on
Kufa but when Mukhtar began to massacre people on a large scale in
Kufa and announced his claim that Jibrail (the angel of revelation)
visits me with the Wahi (revelation) from Allah and I have been made
a prophet", the inhabitants began to flee from the city. Some went to
Basra and some went direct to Abdullah bin Zubair (= .'i.1 IS"';) and
narrated to him the atrocities perpetrated by Mukhtar and his claim to
prophethood. Hearing that Mukhtar am1ounced his claim to
prophethood, Abdullah bin Zubair (= 11 IS"';) did not think it proper to
delay even a little in exterminating this abomination. He wrote to
Muhallab to move quickly and answered Mus' ab insisting that he wait
for the arrival of Muhallab in Basra and then together with him
invaded Kufa.

The Death of Mukhtar and Capture of Kufa
When Muhallab came, Mus' ab bin Zubair ( ~ .'i.1 IS"';) asked him to
array his army in a particular manner. He sent Abdur Rahman bin
Ahnaf to Kufa and instructed rum to stay there and take the oath of
allegiance from the people in the name of Abdullah bin Zubair (.'i.1 IS"'J
~). He set Abbad bin Haseen Hatmi Tamimi in the vanguard, Umar
bin Obaidullah bin Mamar on the right flank, Muhallab bin Abu Sofra
on the left flank and himself in the middle. Arrayed in this manner the

126

History of Islam

army left Basra and marched towards Kufa. When Mukhtar received
the news, he also came out of Kufa with his army. Ibrahim bin Malik
was Governor of Mosil at the time and he failed to come to Kufa.
There was a group in the army of Basra consisting of those who had
fled from Kufa and sought refuge in Basra . That group was led by
Muhammad bin Ash' ath. The confrontation of those two armies took
place near a village named Madar. It was a fierce battle in which
Mukhtar was defeated. He fled from Kufa, fortified the royal palace
and stayed there besieged.
When the Kufan army was put to rout, Mohammad bin Ash'ath
followed the runaways and continued slaying them as they escaped
for a long distance. Mus' ab bin Zubair besieged the royal palace that
lasted for several days. One thousand people were besieged inside the
palace with Mukhtar. Finally, compelled by the shortage of food
supplies, he made up his mind to open the gate of the fort and die
fighting. His companions forbade him and advised him to ask Mus'ab
for security of his life before opening the gate. They were sure that
Mus'ab would give him security of his life but he disapproved of this
advice. He poured scented oil on his head, rubbed perfume on his
clothes, armed himself and came out of the palace. Only nineteen
persons accompanied him. The rest remained behind in the palace.
Mukhtar came out and attacked and was killed by the sons of
Abdullah bin Dajaja Saifi.
Mukhtar was killed on 14 Ramadan 67 A.H. Among his companions
who were killed included Obaidullah Ali bin Abu Talib. Mus'ab
arrested those who were besieged in the palace. Those arrested on the
battlefield were also brought to Kufa. The captives were brought to a
vast field and a counsel was held. Muhallab bin Abi Sofra was of the
opinion that they should be let off but Mohammad bin Ash' ath and all
the other Ku fans forbade Mus' ab bin Zubair to act upon that advice.
Mus'ab bin Zubair was in a fix . The Kufans said. "They took the oath
of allegiance, at Mukhtar's hands and he did not spare a single house
in Kufa he put at least one or two persons to death in every house. If
the. captives were set free, the whole of Kufa will turn rebellious." The
captives numbered six thousand. Seven hundred were Arabs and the
rest were Persians. After deep thought Mus'ab bin Zubair finally

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

127

decided that they should be done away with and therefore, all were
slain. The Kufans heaved a sigh of relief. Mus'ab had Mukhtar's both
hands severed and hung on the gate of Kufa's central mosque, which
continued hanging there until the time of Hajjaj's leadership.
Having captured Kufa, Mus'ab bin Zubair wrote a letter to Ibrahim
bin Malik who was appointed Governor of Mosil by Mukhtar, "You
must surrender to me. I shall give you authority over Syria . I also
promise that all the countries you capture from Syria to the west will
be granted to you." Now after Mukhtar's death, Abdul Malik bin
Marwan from Damascus wrote a letter to Ibrahim, "You lay down
your arms before me and I shall give you authority over Iraq and
what ever territories yo1,1 occupy towards the east will,be included
under your rule." Ibrahim had received identica!Jetters from both the
sides. He preferred Mus'ab to Abdul Malik. He visited Kufa,
recognized Abdullah bin Zubair's caliphate and took the oath of
allegiance, at Mus'ab's hands. Mus'ab deputed Muhallab bin Abi
Sofra to Mosil and Jazirah (The region that lies between the Euphrates
and Tigris rivers and is bounded on the south by a line running
between Takrit and Anbar. It is the northern end of Mesopotamia,
now making up part of northern Iraq and extending into eastern
Turkey and extreme northeastern Syria) and kept Ibrahim with hfm as
commander-in-chief. When Abdullah bin Zubair (-= 11 cs""_;) heard of
Mukhtar's death and the capture of Kufa, he nominated Mus'ab and
his own son Hamza bin Abdullah, as the Governor of Kufa and Basra.
Hamza displeased the people of Basra and they wrote letters to
Abdullah bin Zubair ('---"' 11 cs-" J) requesting him to dismiss .him and
send Mus'ab as Governor. Finally in 68 A.H., the Governorship of
Basra was also entrusted to Mus'ab by Abdullah bin Zubair (-= ./iii CS'-'~).

Amr bin Sayeed was killed
It has already been mentioned that Obaidullah bin Zeyad, following
his failure in confronting and ·besieging Zafar bin Harith, had left
Qarqisa. When Ibn Zeyad was killed, Abdul Malik organized his army
and wanted to invade Iraq. First of all he thought it proper to invade
.Zafar bin HaritQ Kalbi, the Governor of Qarqisa. Abdul Malik
t~erefore appointed his sister's son Abdur Rahman bin Umm Hakam
as his deputy in Damascus and he himself, taking Amr bin Sayeed bin

128

History of Islam

Aas and an army set out to Qarqisa. Mention has been made
previously that Marwan bin Hakam was enthroned on the condition
that Khalid bin Yazid and Amr bin Sayeed would be the rulers
respectively after him. Instead of giving the reign of the country to
them, he declared his own sons Abdul Malik and Abdul Aziz as his
successors. Khalid and Amr both were deposed from the succession .
Amr bin Sayeed commanded respect and popularity among Banu
Umayyah. He had many slaves and material possessions. He also had
ability as a commander. When Abdul Malik sat on the throne after
Marwan, he treated Amr bin Sayeed so well that his resentment and
rankling in his heart evaporated and when he marched with his army
to Qargisa, Amr bin Sayeed asked him on the way to nominate him as
his successor, since similar promises were made to him earlier he
simply . wanted a formal announcement and confirMotion. Abdul
Malik refused to fulfil his wish and Amr bin Sayeed felt betrayed and
distraught. Having an opportunity on the way he slipped away and
returned to Damascus and immediately after his arrival drove out
Abdur Rahman, the acting governor, occupied Damascus and declared
his caliphate and reign. He gathered the people, gave a sermon and
made promises to fix salaries for them and treat them kindly.
On receiving this news, Abdul Malik immediately returned to
Damascus and laid a siege to it. The fight continued for a long
period Abdul Malik could not pay attention to any other issue. At
last, the people made them agree to a reconciliation. The
agreement was drafted and Amr bin Sayeed coming out of the
town, met Abdul Malik in his tent and handed over Damascus to
him. Abdul Malik always had an apprehension of Amr bin Sayeed .
Now he thought it important to stamp out that danger. He invited
him to his court to begin the deception. Amr bin Sayeed came and
sat on the throne beside him as usual. Some persons had already
been put in place to carry out the deed of treachery and so he was
caught and killed.
When Amr bin Sayeed's brother Yahya received the inforMotion, he
rushed with one thousand people to attack the headquarters of the
Amir and besieged it. Abdul Malik cut off Amr bin Sayeed's head and
tossed it down to them and rained down money from above. They
people began to pick up money and Yahya was left standing all alone.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

129

At last, he was caught and imprisoned. Amr bin Sayeed's sons were
also sent to jail with Yahya. They remained there until Mus'ab bin
Zubair (= 1115"'~) was killed and Abdul Malik occupied Iraq. Amr bin
Sayeep was killed in 69 A.H.

Mus'ab bin Zubair's Imprudence
It has been mentioned above that Basra was ruled over by Hamza bin
Abdullah bin Zubair for less than a year and after that its
administration was also entrusted to Mus' ab bin Zubair Mus' ab bin
Zubair personally went to Basra and appointed Amr bin Obaidullah
his deputy there, and instructed him to go to Persia to discipline the
Khawarij if needed, and to depute smneone else in Basra. After
shifting and replacing the governors and lieutenants of these
provinces and staying for a few days there, he left Basra and returned
to Kufa . In 70 A.H., the mischief of the Khawarij gained momentum.
Mughira bin Muhallab and Amr bin Obaidullah failed to stamp it out.
Mus'ab bin Zubair transferred Muhallab bin Abi Sofra from the
Governorship of Mosil to that of Persia and ordered him to suppress
the Khawarij there. It is understood that none other than Muhallab
bin Abi Sofra could have tackled the problem of the Khawarij. He
said, "I am glad to go to Persia but to shift me from here will be
extremely harmful for you because Abdul Malik bin Marwan has
begun to spread his net of secret conspiracies in Iraq. I have been
studying his manipulation very minutely. I am afraid if I depart from
here, he might succeed in his maneuverings."
Mus' ab bin Zubair considered the urgency of Persia more of a priority
to a problem that was not yet manifested. Muhallab was therefore
ordered to leave for Persia. Mus'ab had two very efficiei1t and
experienced generals Ibrahim and Muhallab. He had one of them part
from him. He sent Abdullah bin Hzim as Governor of Khurasan.
Abbad bin Haseen was put with Muhallab both of whom were
seasoned veterans and experienced generals. Thus, Mus'ab bin Zubair
separated his ·able men from him and sent them to distant places. Only
Ibrahim bin Malik in Kufa and Amr bin Obaidullah bin Mamar in
Basra were left.
Abdul Malik bin Marwan, being freed from the internal danger to his

130

History of Islam

caliphate by killing Amr bin Sayeed had begun to hatch conspiracies
against the rule of Abdullah bin Zubair (=- .:iii i.s-PJ), He sent his men to
Persia and tempted and lured the Khawarij and incited them to revolt.
Then he sent his agents to Kufa and Basra also, and succeeded in
spreading his net of conspiracies through the supporters of Banu
Umayyah. He began to tempt the military officers of Mus' ab bin
Zubair by sending letters to them. He went to the extent of trying to
lure and bring Muhallab and Ibrahim to his side but they were not the
type to betray Mus'ab bin Zubair. That is why Muhallab was very
pensive and concerned when he left Syria for Persia.

Abdul Malik's War Preparations
Abdul Malik sent Khalid bin Obaidullah bin Khalid bin Usaid to Basra
on a secret mission to convert the people to support Banu Umayyah
and oppose Abdullah bin Zubair. Khalid, therefore, visited Basra and
initiated the conspiratorial process and won a number of people to his
side. When Amr bin Obaidullah bin Mamar came to know of it, he
sent an army to Basra. Khalid's men fought but Khalid was driven out
of Basra. When the disturbing news reached Kufa, and the state of
affairs was fully conveyed to Mus'ab bin Zubair, it was impossible for
him to remain passive once he understood the conspiracy.
The disturbing news brought Mus'ab bin Zubair from Kufa to Basra.
He punished and fined Khalid's companions and had the houses of
some pulled down. Similarly in Kafa too, Abdul Malik' s men had
been working secretly. The greatest trouble was from some military
leaders like Attab bin Warqa who had entered into a plot with Abdul
Malik.
On the one hand, Abdul Malik began to make preparations for a
major battle, and spread conspiracies of rebellion among the armies
of Kufa and Basra on the other. One day, Ibrahim bin Ushtur
received a sealed letter from Abdul Malik bin Marwa~. He
immediately knew what it contained. He gave it to Mus' ab
unopened with the seal still intact. When Mus' ab read it, it disclosed
that Abdul Malik had written to Ibrahim, "Come to my side. I shall
make you the Governor of Iraq."

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

131

The Death of Mus'ab bin Zubair
At last, after completing his preparations, Abdul Malik left Syria and
marched towards Iraq. He left Damascus after he had received many
letters from the noblemen of Kufa inviting him to invade it at once.
His counselors forbade him saying the letters from Kufa might be
similar to those received by Husain ('--"' .'ii, cs--".;). Abdul Malik said,
"Imam Husain(= 11'-,..,'J) was fully dependent on Kufa. I am going with
a strong army. Their breach of trust and betrayal can not harm me. I am
sure, once they see me with a strong army, they will not go back on
the promise they made in their letters."
At last, Abdul Malik marched with his army. Mus' ab bin Zubair also
started from the other side. At the time when Abdi:i'I Malik's news of
attack reached Kufa, Mus'ab bin Zubair had already sent Amr bin
Obaidullah bin Mamar to Persia to help suppress the Khawarij. So
even Amr bin Obaidullah was away from the battle. Both the armies
pitched their tents at Dair jathaleeq. Mus'ab bin Zubair's army was
small because at the last-minute many of his men refused to go and
presented lame excuses. A large number of those who ventured to
come on to the battlefield were in collusion with the enemy and were
waiting to join the enemy the moment the battle started. The fight
began and Abdul Malik first attacked the part of the army
commanded by Ibrahim bin Malik because he feared him. The attack
was launched by Abdul Malik's brother Mohammad bin Marwan.
Both sides displayed exemplary valor. Ultimately Ibrahim pushed
Mohammad bin Marwan back. Seeing him retreat, Abdul Malik sent
Obaidullah bin Yazid with a fresh group of soldiers to help
Mohammad because they were in a pitched battle. It was in this
fight that Muslim bin Umar Bahli (Qutaiba bin Muslim's father)
was killed. '
When Mus'ab bin Zubair saw Ibrahim getting mobbed, he sent Attab
bin Warga to his restue. Attab bin Warga had already taken the oath
of allegiance secretly for Abdul Malik. He fled from the field
accordingly. Ibrahim, though surrounded by enemies, killed fighting
bravely. His death boosted the morale of Abdul Malik and the Syrians
ai\d they were now very sure of their victory.

132

History of Islam

Mus'ab bin Zubair asked his other generals and associates to move
ahead and launch an attack but no one moved from his place. They all
turned as if deaf. Only a few were fighting and the remaining Kufan
soldiers were only spectators.
The Kufan's betrayal this time even exceed the betrayal which they
had perpetrated on Imam Husain(= 11 ._...;,,) because they were forced
by Ibn Zeyad and his army not to support Imam Husain(= 11 ._...;,,) and
they were terror stricken to the extreme.
It was nothing but greed and their sheer disobedience, betrayal and
ingratitude that stopped them from siding with Mus'ab bin Zubair.
Abdul Malik did not want Mus' ab to be killed so he sent his brother
Muhammad bin Marwan to him with the word, "The fight has taken a
turn for t{:le worse for you. You can never win. I give you security and
pardon. Please accept it." Mus'ab refused, saying," Allah's security is
sufficient for me." Then Mohammad bin Marwan said to Mus'ab's son
Isa, "Amir al-Muminin Abdul Malik has granted security to you and
to your father." Hearing that he came to his father . Mus'ab said, "Yes,
I do believe that the Syrians will keep their promise with you. You
may go with their security if you like." Isa said, "I shall not give the
chance to the women of Quraish to say that Isa has betrayed his father
for the sake of his own life." Mus'ab said, "Well, then go to your uncle
Abdullah bin Zubair (~ 11 ._...;,,) in Makkah and narrate to him about
the Iraqi's betrayal. Leave me here. I have considered myself already
killed." Isa said, "I won't go to break that kind of news. You can leave
the battlefield and go to Basra. The people there are very pleased with
you. They are loyal to you in all respects. Some alternative might be
thought out in Basra or let us go to Makkah then."

Mus' ab said, "My son, this is not possible because my flight from the
field would become a topic of heated discussion among the Quraish.
Better give up this idea and attack the enemy." Isa then took his
troops and attacked the enemy and after killing many of the enemy
soldiers, he dropped dead before his father's eyes.
Abdul Malik came forward and entreated Mus'~b, "Please gq...,back
from the field or accept the offer of security. In his appeal, h~ ~as
humble but Mus' ab ignored it. That must have been a strange time,
Abdul Malik was pleading with his enemy for his safety while

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

simultaneously seeing the consequences of his secret plots. The Kufan
army was in the field but it was not obeying its' Amir' and silently
watching from a distance. Mus'ab bin Zubair was puzzled seeing the
army that had followed his orders and sacrificed their lives,
treacherously abandoning him. By killing Mus' ab bin Zubair and
Imam Husain (~ 1, er-";) the Kufans committed a crime of the same
magnitude although these two crimes were accomplished in two
different ways. Imam Husain(= 1, _,;,;) wanted his enemies to let him
leave the battlefield and go to either Makkah or Damascus or any
other place and Mus'ab bin Zubair's enemies themselves wished him
to leave the battlefield and go to the place of his choice. Imam
Husain's enemies did not listen to him and here Mus'ab bin Zubair
rejected his enemies appeal to escape. The consequences in both the
cases were the same.
Mus' ab bin Zubair went to his tent after his son's death, put oil on his
hair, perfumed himself, came out and attacked his enemies. Only
seven persons were left with him and they were all killed together
with him. He attacked so fiercely that he disturbed the Syrian's lines.
At last, he dropped unconscious after receiving innumerable wounds
of arrows, swords and spears. As soon as he collapsed, the Syrians cut
off his head and so in 71 A.H. a decade after, the drama of Karbala it
was repeated at Dair Jathaleeq.
Abdul Malik took the oath of allegiance from all the Kufan army for
his caliphate on that same battlefield. He left it and reached Nakhlah
near Kufa and halted there for forty days. When he felt satisfied that
the Kufan's would remain loyal, he entered the city. He delivered a
sermon at the central mosque in which he promised to treat them
kindly. Then he pleased them with gifts and by treating them
honorably. He wrote to the Governors of Persia, Khorasan, Basra and
Ahwaz to take the oath from their people for him.
He retained M uhallab bin Abi Sofra in his original position. They all
recognized Abdul Malik's caliphate since there was no other
alternative. Only Abdullah bin Hazim who governed a part of
Khorasan, refused to take the oath and was killed by Bahr bin Warqa
after a few days.
Abdul Malik made Khalid bin Osaid and his own brother Bashir bin

134

History of Islam

Marwan the Governors of Basra and Kufa respectively. He sent
Mus'ab bin Zubair's head to Damascus. When it reached there, the
people wanted to make a display of it but Abdul Malik's wife named
Atika bint Yazid bin Muawiya forbade them to do so. She had it
washed and then buried. Muhallab bin Abi Sofra also surrendered to
Abdul Malik and took the people's oaths on his behalf.

Zofar bin Harith and Abdul Malik
The siege of Qarqisa has already been narrated. Obaidullah bin Zeyad
and the other chiefs failed to subdue Zafar bin Harith and in every
attack the Syrians suffered defeat. Now when Abdul Malik bin
Marwan turned to Iraq with his army, he gave an army to Aban bin
Oqba bin Abu Mu'ait, the governor of Hims, and sent him ahead
before his own departure. The purpose was to defeat Zafar bin Harith.
Aban arrived and began the fight. Abdul Malik arrived there with a
huge army before the b'attle had rendered any result. He laid siege to
Qarqisa. Zafar bin Harith ordered his son Hudhail to attack the
Syrians and not to return before the fall of Abdul Malik's tent.
Hudhail obeyed his father and launched such a fierce attack that he
succeeded in felling Abdul Malik' s tent and returned safely. When
Abdul Malik realized that it was not going to be easy to win Qargisa
and subdue Zafar bin Harith, he sent a message to him, "I give safety
and pardon to you and your son. Take whatever post you like."
Zafar bin Harith replied, "I agree to compromise with you provided
you don't press me to take the oath for a year and you do not demand
any help from me against Abdullah bin Zubair." The agreement was
about to be written when Abdul Malik received news that four towers
of the city's gate had been razed to the ground therefore he refused to
compromise and ordered the attack to continue. However, it proved
fruitless and Zofar bin Harith forced Abdul Malik's army to retreat.
Abdul Malik sent the message again, saying that he was ready to
agree to all his 'conditions. Zofar bin Harith said, "I won't take the
oath for anyone as long as Abdullah bin Zubair (= .11 ._,.:,J) is living.
Further, I want your promise that my troops will not be subjected to
any interrogation or revenge."
Abdul Malik accepted all his conditions wrote the agreement and sent

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

135

it to him. Despite this Zofar bin Harith did not go to Abdul Malik
because the case of Amr bin Sayeed was known to all. Ultimately,
Abdul Malik sent the Prophet's staff he had with him to Zofar bin
Harith. Zofar bin Harith kept this staff as a guarantor and went to
Abdul Malik. Abdul Malik made him sit by his side on the throne and
honored him and had his son Muslim bin Abdul Malik married to
Zofar bin Harith's daughter. Freeing himself from the problems of
Qarqisa he moved towards Mus' ab bin Zubair, the outcome of that
advance has been narrated above.

The News of Mus'ab bin Zubair's Death in Makkah
When the news reached Abdullah bin Zubair (= 11 CS""J) in Makkah
that his brother, Mus'ab bin Zubair, was betrayed and treacherously
killed and all of the territories of Iraq went under the domination of
Abdul Malik bin Marwan, he gathered all the Makkans and addressed
them as follows:
You should know that Allah does not dishonor him who is on the
right path though alone, and does not honor him whose supporter is
the Satan though he has many supporters. And you should know that
news has come from Iraq that makes me sad and happy, news of
Mus'ab bin Zubair's death has come. I am happy because his death
amounts to his martyrdom. I am sad because parting with a loyal
friend at a time of crisis gives a burning pain, which every friend
would feel. A man of good sense accepts it patiently and
unwaveringly. Who was Mus'ab? He was one of the slaves of Allah
and one of my supporters. Let it be known to you that the Iraqis are
very disloyal and great hypocrites. They bartered the profit gained
from Mus' ab for a petty price. If Mus' ab was slain, his father, brother
and son who were all very gentle and pious were also slain. By Allah,
we shall not die in bed as the descendents of Abul-Aas are dying (This
is in reference to Abdul Malik' s father Marwan bin Hakam. Abul Aas
was the grandfather of Marwan). By Allah, none ~f them was killed on
the battlefield either in the days of ignorance or after the coming of
Islam. We are used to _dying from the wounds of spears and swords.
Brothers, beware, the ·world has been taken as a loan from the
Magnificent Emperor whose kingdom is eternal and whose territory

136

History of Islam

doesn' t perish. If the world comes to us, we shall not take it as the low,
the deviated and the disgraced do and if it turns its back on us and
escapes, we shall not weep over it as the weak, the destitute and the
senseless do. This is what I wanted to tell you and I beg forgiveness of
Allah for you all.

Abdul Malik and Abdullah bin Zubair (~ .:iii .s-PJ)
After bringing Iraq under his domination, Abdul Malik sent Urwah
bin Anif with six thousand men to Madinah with the instructions to
halt outside of the city and not to enter it unless he received another
order from him. Harith bin Hatib bin Ma'mar was the Governor of
Madinah who was appointed by Abdullah bin Zubair. Hearing of
Urwa's approach, Harith left the city. Urwa encamped outside the city
for a month without touching or disturbing anything, then he went
back to Abdul Malik in Damascus and Harith returned to Madinah.
Abdullah bin Zubair ("--"' 11 CS"") had sent Sulaiman bin Khalid as the
Governor of Khaibar and Fadak. Abdul Malik bin Marwan gave
Abdul Malik bin Harith bin Hakam four thousand soldiers and
ordered him to conquer the Hijaz. He encamped in Wadi Al-Qura and
from there he sent lbn Qamqam with a division of the army to
Khaibar with the instructions to launch a night attack on Sulaiman.
Sulaiman was.caught and killed and lbn Qamqam stayed at Khaibar.
Hearing the news of the invasion of the Hijaz, Abdullah bin Zubair
( ~ 11\.>"""'.,,) dismissed Harith bin Hatib from the governorship of
Madinah and appointed Jabir bin Aswad bin' Auf Zuhri in his place.
Jabir reached Madinah and sent Abu Bakr bin Abu Qais with a
regiment of six hundred soldiei;s to Khaibar. In the battle that ensued,
lbn Qamqam suffered a defeat and fled . Some of his troops were
killed on the battlefield and some escaped.
When Abdul Malik bin Marwan received the news, he sent Tariq bin
Amr as the commander of the Hijaz expedition. He further instructed
him to halt between Wadi Al-Qara and 'Eila' and try his best to stop
the Governors of lbn Zubair (= 11 s?J) from advancing and capturing
any more territory, and stamp out the movement against him there
before it succeeded. Tariq did accordingly. He sent a strong army

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

137

towards Khaibar. In the skirmish that followed, Abu Bakr bin Abu
Qais along with two hundred soldiers was killed. Tariq stayed at
Khaibar. Jabir bin Aswad received the news and sent two thousand
soldiers from Madinah to face Tariq. The clash took place near
Khaibar. Tariq was victorious and killed all the captives and the
wounded.
Abdullah bin Zubair ("'------'>- 11 ~)) dismissed Jabir bin Aswad from the
governorship of Madin.ah and appointed in his place Talha bin Abdullah
bin Auf known as Talhat-un-Nida. After that, the state of Khaibar was
annexed to Abdul Malik bin Marwan's caliphate and Talha bin
Abdullah continued to govern Madin.ah on behalf of Abdullah bin
Zubair (= 11 1,,-,'J). No clash worth mentioning took place be tween them
because Abdul Malik' s attention was centered on Iraq and Iran.

Siege of Makkah
Abdul Malik wanted to persuade the Syrian chiefs to attack Makkah
but all of them refused to face Abdullah bin Zubair (= 11 c,..-'J) and turn
the Ka'bah into a battlefield . He then left Damascus and went to Kufa.
There he induced Hajjaj bin Yusuf Thaqafi to do it. Hajjaj took three
thousand soldiers and left Kufa in Jumad Al-Awwal 72 A.H. and went
to Madinah from there he went to Tai£ and set up camp according to
Abdul Malik's instructions. From Taif, he used to send his cavalry to
Arafat and they would come back after engaging in small skirmishes.
Several months passed by in this way. Then Hajjaj wrote to Abdul
Malik to send him some more soldiers as reinforcements and permit
him to go ahead and lay siege to Makkah.
Abdul Malik conceded to Hajjaj' s request and sent five thousand men
to him and wrote to Tariq to attack Madinah and after taking over
Madinah, move to Makkah and help Hajjaj. Hajjaj besieged Makkah in
the month of Ramadan fixed a catapult on the mount of Abu Qubais
and started launching stones. For the Makkans fasting in the month of
Ramadan and being attacked by stones was indeed a very difficult
month. Getting tired of the siege, the people began to leave from the
city. Dhul-Qa' dah followed Ramadan and Shawwal and the Makkans
did not get any respite from the severity and pressure of the siege.

138

History of Islam

Abdullah bin Zubair (= 111,S""') went to face the enemy daily and tried to
get the better of the attackers but the number of his troops kept
dwindling and so his plan did not yield any movement towards victory.
Many Makkans were going out of the city and the shortage and cost of
foodstuff had shaken the hopes of those remaining. In Dhul-Qa' dah 72
A.H. Tariq expelled Talhatun Nida, Abdullah bin Zubair's Governor,
from Madinah and made a Syrian the Administrator of Madinah, he
himself left for Makkah along with five thousand soldiers. That added
to Hajjaj's strength considerably and the little hope the Makkans had,
vanished. It was in that state that the month of Dhul Hijjah began and
pilgrims from a far started pouring into the city.
Abdullah bin Zubair (= 11 I,>"'J) had allowed Hajjaj to perform his Hajj
but he did not do Tawaf (circumambulation of the Ka'bah) nor did he
do Sai (running and walking) between the mounts of Safa and
Marwah. When Abdullah bin Zubair (-= 111,S""') wanted to go to the
plain of rArafat, Hajjaj prevented him. For this reason, he made the
sacrifice in Makkah itself. There was no Imam on the plain of Arafat to
lead the prayers and the pilgrims could not perform all the rites of
Hajj. Hajjaj did not stop the siege or the rain of stones even during the
Hajj and so going around the Ka'bah was fraught with danger. With
the arrival of the pilgrims in Makkah, the severity of the famine also
increased. Abdullah bin Omar (1...p .il,1 I,>"' J) also came to perform Hajj
that year. Realizing the gravity of the situation, he sent a message to
Hajjaj, "O slave of Allah! Think about the people from far off lands
that have come for Hajj. They should have the opportunity to make
Tawaf (circumambulation of the Ka'bah) and Sai (running and
walking) between the mounts of Safa and Marwa. Stop the rain of
stones until the end of Hajj." The message had its effect. Hajjaj
stopped the catapult but did not make Tawaf himself nor did he allow
Abdullah bin Zubair to go to the plain of Arafat. With the conclusion
of the Hajj, the announcement was made on behalf of Hajjaj that those
coming from abroad should leave for their homes at once because lbn
Zubair (= 11 \,S""'J) was soon going to be showered with stones. As soon
as they heard the ominous proclaMotion, they set out for their
respective destinations. Along with them most of those who had
remained in Makkah escaped.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

139

Hajjaj resumed his attack with the catapult. A large boulder fell on the
roof of the Ka'bah and it collapsed. With the fall of that stone, a peal of
thunder came from the heavens. Lightning flashed and then darkness
engulfed the earth and the sky. Hajjaj's soldiers became terrified and
gave up using the catapult. Hajjaj consoled and encouraged them and
said, "This lightning and this peal of thunder have come to help me.
They symbolize my victory. Don't give way to fear at all."
The darkness continued for a couple of days and a loud crackling bolt
of lightening killed a few of Hajjaj' s soldiers. The soldiers were
extremely concerned. The lightening was flashing again the next day
and a thunderbolt this time hit two soldiers of Abdullah bin Zubair
( ~ .'iii ,?J) who died on impact. This gladdened Hajjaj's heart and his
soldiers also heaved a sigh of relief. Hajjaj himself loaded stones and
began shooting them. After that, the fear that was gripping the whole
army vanished and the launching of stones resumed more vigorously.
Abdullah bin Zubair (= 11 ..,;,J) used to offer his prayer at the Ka'bah
and big stones would fall around him but it did not disturb his
concentration on Allah and his devotion during his prayer in the least.
The siege continued with the same intensity and force . No supplies
from outside Makkah could come in. Things came to such a pass that
Abdullah bin Zubair (= 1ii1 ~J) slaughtered his horse and distributed it
among the people. He had a stock of grain and dates. He distributed
as much as was necessary for them to survive. The purpose was to
stand the siege as long as possible. When Hajjaj saw that his plan was
not going to succeed, he began to write to Abdullah bin Zubair's men
and promise them security and amnesty to those who would join him.
This worked and many of them parted with Abdullah bin Zubair (..,;,J
~ .'iii) and went over to Hajjaj's side finally, only a few persons were
left with him. His two sons, Hamza and Habib, also left their father
and went over to Hajjaj. The third son remained with his father and
displayed valor on the battlefield until the last breath of his life.
When thousands of men left Abdullah bin Zubair (= .'iii ~J) and joined
the opposing side, Hajjaj gathered them together and addressed them
as follows :
You can estimate the remaining power of Abdullah bin Zubair (11 ~~
~) . His men are in such short number that if each of you threw a

140

History of Islam

handful of pebbles on them, they would all die. Besides that, all of
them are hungry and thirsty. 0 my dear Syrians and Kufans! Advance
now. Abdullah bin Zubair (= 11_,.;,) will live only for a few seconds.
Now prior to this speech, Hajjaj had sent a letter to Abdullah bin
Zubair (= 11 _,.;, J) which read:
"Now you have been rendered powerless. You have become helpless
in all respects. Come under my security and take the oath for Amir alMuminin, Abdul Malik. You will be treated with all honor and every
wish of yours will be fulfilled. I have been ordered by Amir alMuminin to try my best to invite you to reconciliation and not to be
hasty in killing you.

Martyrdom of lbn Zubair (u-.11 l,S"'J)
After going through the letter Abdullah bin Zubair (-= 11 _,.;,J) went to
his mother, Asma bint Abu Bakr Siddiq(~ 11_,.;,J), and said to her: I have
been left with no one (to support me). Only five persons worth the
name of friend are with me who have supported me until now. The
people have betrayed me just as they betrayed Husain bin Ali (11_,.;,J
=). Their sons fought with their swords in front of their fathers only as
long as they lived. My sons also went over to the wicked. Now Hajjaj
tells me: "you too come under my security and I shall give you all you
demand". I have therefore come to you to seek your advice.
Asma ( ~ 11 _,.;,J) replied: You understand your problem better than I
do. If you are on the right path and invite people to it, keep doing it.
Your friends died on this right path. You ~hould also remain steadfast
on it and meet your martyrdom. If you had intended to seek worldly
prosperity, you are a great misfit. You have not only landed yourself
in trouble but also those who are with you. As for my opinion, don't
hand yourself over to Banu Umayyah. Death will come on time. You
should live and die like a man. Your statement that you are justified
and that people have made you weak by their betrayal, is a kind of
complaint that does not come on the tongue of the pious."
Abdullah bin Zubair (= 11_,.;,J) said: "I am afraid that after killing me
they have my body trampled by horsemen and hang it on the scaffold.
Asma ( ~ 11_,.;,J) said: My son! When the goat is slaughtered, it does

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

141

not care whether it is skinned. Whatever you are doing, keep doing it
with insight and keep asking for Allah's help."
Abdullah bin Zubair (-= .'i.1 ,_,..;,J) kissed his mother's head and said: "I
am also of the same view. I never wished for the world or desired a
worldly kingdom. I took this work because the commandments of
Allah were not being obeyed and the people did not shun the
forbidden things. As long as I breathe, I shall continue to fight for the
right. I thought it necessary to take counsel from you and it has
strengthened my will. Mother! I am sure I shall be killed today. Don't
be sad. Surrender me to Allah. I never intended to do anything unlawful.
I never committed a breach of trust nor did I perpetrate an atrocity on
anyone nor did I support any oppressor. I never did anything against
the Divine wish. 0 Allah! I haven't said all these things out of pride
but for the consolation and satisfaction of my mother."
Asma said, "I hope Allah will reward you for it. Go and attack the
enemy with Allah's Name."
When Asma ( ~ .'i.1 ,_,..;, J) embraced her son at the time of bidding him
good-bye, her hands happened to touch his armor. She asked, "Why
have you put on this armor?" He said, "For satisfaction and strength."
Asma (~ 11 ,_,..;, J) said: "Take it off and fight against the enemy in your
ordinary clothes."
Ibn Zubair ('------"" 11 ,_,..;,J) took the armor off and threw it away. He lifted
up the end of his shirt and tied it to his waist. He rolled up his sleeves
and came out of his house and said to his friends :
"O children of Zubair (-= 11,_,..;,J)! Don't be afraid of the clanging of the
swords because applying ointment to a wound hurts it more than
what is felt when the wound is received. Hold your swords. Save it,
from unlawful killing as you save your face. Lower down your eyes so
that they may not get dazzled. Attack your counterpart. Don't look for
me. If you do look for me, you will find me fighting with the enemies
in the forefront."
Saying that he launched a very ferocious attack on the Syrians.
Chopping through their battle array, he reached the rear line of the
Syrians and came fighting back to his place. Hajjaj incited his soldiers

142

History of Islam

to the utmost but none dared to face Abdullah bin Zubair (= .iii1_,;, ))At last, Hajjaj took the infantry and surrounded Abdullah bin Zubair's
flag holder. Abdullah bin Zubair (= .iii1 _,..;,;) at once led an attack and
brought his flag holder out of the siege and pushed the enemies back.
He returned and offered two 'rakats' of 'salat' near Maqam Ibrahim
(Station of Ibrahim) . Hajjaj attacked again and the flag holder was
killed at Bab Banu Shaiba. The Syrians had stood guard at all the
doors of the Haram Sharif (the honored sanctuary). Hajjaj and Tariq
had laid siege up to Marwa from the side of Al Batah (this final battle
took place in the holy confines of the sanctuary of the Ka'bah).
Now lbn Zubair ( ~ .iii1 _,..;,;) was attacking from one side to the other.
Having offered his prayer, he resumed fighting. He attacked in the
direction of Bab Safa and pushed the Syrians to the distant rear.
Somebody shot an arrow from the top of Mount Safa. It hit his
forehead and he started bleeding. He continued to fight in that
condition. In short, he and his companions, from the morning until
after the post noon prayer, displayed such exemplary agility and
bravery in putting the Syrians to death that the world has never
witnessed. At last, all his companions laid down their lives one by
one. The enemies rained down stones and arrows on him from all
sides threw spears and swords had already left him wounded. At long
last, on Tuesday in Jamad al-Awwal 73 A.H. this grand hero and
pious man of the world met his martyrdom. With the exception of valor.
and dauntlessness, piety and prayer, courage and nobility, there was
none there to mourn over his dead body. The Syrian army cut off his
head. When it was taken to Hajjaj, he prostrated out of thankfulness to
Allah. The army raised the cry Allahu Akbar. The dead body was
hung on a scaffold at the same place Hajun and the h(!~d was sent to
Abdul Malik. Another tradition says that it was not sent to him but it
was hung on the wall or the rain channel of the Ka'bah.
Asma bint Abi Bakr (4-----;.. .iii1_,..;, ;) sought permission to bury the dead
body but Hajjaj refused. When Abdul Malik came to know of it, he
condemned and cursed Hajjaj and allowed it to be buried. Asma also
died after a few days.
After lbn Zubair's martyrdom, Hajjaj entered the Ka'bah. The entire
floor was littered with stones thrown from the catapult. It was stained

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

143

with patches of blood. He had the stones removed and the blood
washed. He took from the Makkans the oath for Abdul Malik' s
caliphate and then returned to Madinah. He lived there for two
months and considering the entire population of Madinah as the
killers of Uthman bin Affan ( ~ .'i,1 c?J) he perpetrated atrocities on
them. He tortured some of the Prophet's (~) Companions. Then he left
for Makkah and after pulling down the construction done by
Abdullah bin Zubair on the Ka'bah, he reconstructed it. Abdul Malik
made him the Governor of the Hijaz and Hajjaj bin Yusuf began to live
in Madinah in place of Tariq.

A Glance at Abdullah lbn Zubair's (~ .iii1 .r"J) Caliphate
Following Muawiya's death, his son Yazid did not deserve to be made
the caliph of the Muslims at that time there were many people who
were more capable of governing and doing the work of the caliphate.
Abdullah bin Zubair (-= 11 c?J) was one of them. Yazid's personal life
was objectionable and that was why some dignitaries of Islam refused
to perform oath for his caliphate.
Had Imam Hasan(= .'i,1 c?)) been living after Amir Muawiya(-= 11 c?J)
the Muslims could have probably accepted him as their caliph or
emperor. Had Abdullah bin Umar (t....p 11 c?)) stood for the caliphate
against Yazid, then not only all the sects in Islam would have
supported him but also a good number of the people from amongst
Banu Umayyah would have been seen in action in his support but he
never cared to do it. Husain ('----"' 11 ~ ) ) tried his best to secure the
caliphate but the Kufans betrayed him. He did not accept the advice of
the people of Makkah and Madinah, and the people of the Hijaz failed
to help him. After him, there was none better than Abdullah bin
Zubair (= .'i,1 c?j) who deserved the caliphate. The greatest proof of his
justified and legal caliphate is the fact that all the people of the Islamic
territories recognized him as their caliph on the basis of their free will,
wherever the people were at liberty, none of them opposed him. Yes,
Banu Umayyah were his rivals in the matter of caliphate and so they
opposed him yet they would have opposed anyone who stood in their
way. They re-established their rule in Syria, Palestine and Egypt, with
a heavy hand and with the same tyrannical and coercive methods,

144

History of Islam

they managed to restore their rule over the entire Islamic world.
Compared to Abdullah bin Zubair's caliphate, Marwan bin Hakam's
and Abdul Malik bin Marwan's caliphates are known as the
Caliphates of the Rebels. Abdul Malik's period of rule," following
Abdullah bin Zubair's martyrdom should be taken as a full-fledged
government and a legal caliphate.
During his regime, Abdullah bin Zubair (= .11 <?J) did not have a time
when he was free from territorial battles and disputes. So, if we do not
find any new conquests and internal amendments and reforMotion
during his rule, it is not surprising. He was a great general and
horsemen he was a great thinker and governor. It was only fate and
destiny that allowed his rivals maneuverings to prove effective and
that let him die as a martyr. His personal life was extremely praise
worthy from the viewpoint of prayer and piety.
Among the caliphates of Banu Umayyah, it was chiefly found that
they knew how to use money and power in establishing and
strengthening their caliphate and government. They were very active
in getting money, and utilized it to serve their purpose very skillfully.
Had there not been created in the people the lust for money, they
would never have succeeded and Ali ( ~ .'i.1 <?J) and Abdullah bin
Zubair ("--'>- .11 ~
J) would have never met with failure against them.
Had Abdullah bin Zubair ("'-----"' .11 <?J) like Abdul Malik bin Marwan
reserved the treasury for his friends and supporters and disregarded
the weak, he would have remained surrounded by many swordsmen
and Banu Umayyah would have had to remain humble. But Abdullah
bin Zubair (= 11 <?J) disliked that impious policy and that is really to
his credit and befitting of him.
During his regime, the killing of Mukhtar bin Abu Dbaid in Kufa was
a remarkable achievement. He suppressed the mischief of the
Khawarij very effectively and to the best of his ability, he did not
allow them to revolt. If he had not been involved in battles and trials
of strength against Banu Umayyah, he would have proved to be a
good caliph and considerably promoted the Islamic Shari' ah in the
world. His martyrdom marks the end of Sahaba' rule and governance
(the rule by the Prophet's Companions). He was the last of the
Prophet's Companions who ruled over an Islamic land and whose

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

145

dedicated and pious life was a beacon and a g~iding star. He was the
only caliph who made Makkah his capital city. It was not made the
capital by anyone either before him or after him until now.
When we read about the brave feats of Abdullah bin Zubair (= 11 cr"J),
his brother Mus'ab bin Zubair ("--'>' 11 ~ J), his father Zubair bin Al
Awam (~ ..iii ? j) and also the valor and courage of his mother Asma
bint Abu Bakr (4-c<- ..iii ?J), our hearts are filled with awe and th~ people
of the world who know and understand valor are drawn by a natural
love to them. Wallowing in dust and blood, receiving wounds from
swords and arrows in the chest for supporting the cause of right and
always advancing and putting the enemies of the right to death are
some of life's most difficult tests, yet when done for the right cause
they are satisfying and rewarding as well. The strength of heart,
firmness of intention and height of valor and courage find their most
befitting expression in the dazzling lights of swords, the sharp points
of spears and the heavy rain of arrows. Our age is such an
inauspicious and unfortunate age that the stories of the bravery of the
Muslims, laying down their lives as recorded in the pages of history
increase the circulation of blood in our veins for a while but we can
not see with our eyes the battlefields where heads drop when chopped
off by the sword, spears piercing chests, blood gushing forth from the
necks, corpses jumping up in the mud of blood, horses running over
and mutilating them, severed heads getting kicked by horses hooves
and rolling here and there like some macabre fruit at harvest time, the
sun hidden behind clouds of dust made by battling horses and men,
chants of 'Allahu-Akbar' being raised, men of Allah excelling one
another in exalting the Name of their beloved Creator by laying down
their lives and the Divine grace encompassing this exhilarating sight.
Such magnificent and awe inspiring scenes were the portion of Talha
(-= ..iii ?j) and Zubair (= 11 ?J), Khalid(= 11 ?)) wd Darrar (= 11 ?J),
Shurahbil (= .'i,1 ? 1 ) and Abdur Rahman(= 11 ? 1 ), Husain bin Ali(._,.;,)
~ 11) and Abdullah bin Zubair ("--'>' 11 ...-,,J), Tariq bin Zeyad,
Mohammad bin Qasim, Muhammad II, Sulaiman the Magnificent,
Salahuddin Ayyubi and Nuruddin Zangi, Mahmud Ghaznawi and
Shahabuddin Ghauri. It is not the portion of the people of weak 'Iman'
(faith) and timorous hearts as we are. That is why Allah has rendered
swords, spears and arrows useless and sent cannons, rifles and

146

History of Islam

airplanes into the world instead. Also, strength of heart, firmness of
determination, height of ambition and courage, as a symbol and as an
expression of perfect 'Iman' (faith) can be better displayed by the edge
of a sword than by gunpowder and ammunition.

Kufa
From the Analysis of the conditions of the Kufans so far stated,
strange ideas about Kufa and the Kufans grip our hearts and Kufa
appears to be one of the most perplexing places on the surface of the
entire earth. Abdullah bin Saba and all the conspiring groups scored
successes there. It was the Kufans who were in the fore-front in
murdering Uthman b_\n Affan (=.'iii~)); they were again the greatest
admirers and lovers of Ali (~ .'iii ~J and it was they who harassed
him more than others and were responsible for many of his failures; it
was again they who courted Husain ( ~ .'iii ~J) and were ready to
demand the revenge for Ali's death and his caliphate and, at last, it
was they who caused Husain's martyrdom and had him murdered
mercilessly at Karbala; it was they who first of all were instrumental in
demanding the compensation for Husain's blood to prove their love
for him in a splendid manner; it was again they who opposed the
greatest supporter of the Prophet's descendants Mukhtar bin Abu
Obaid and by inviting Mus'ab bin Zubair to attack Kufa had Mukhtar
killed; it was they who caused the death of Mus'ab bin Zubair (.'iii ~ J
;..____;,.); they showed matchless bravery as well as base cowardice;
sometimes they got the.mselves killed fearlessly and opposed the
Kufan rulers openly and sometimes they wer~ so terrified that they
executed every oppressive measure of the Kufan rulers like
Obaidullah bin Zeyad without any question.
To understand such contradictory and contrasting traits and
situations, we should make an attempt to acquaint ourselves with the
conditions and the reality of the inhabitants of Kufa. During the
regime of Umar bin Khattab (~ .'i,1~J, Kufa was made as a
cantonment for those who were at war with the fire-worshippers
(Magian/Zoroastrian) of Iran. One part of it consisted of those who
came from the Hijaz, Yemen and Hadaramout. They had assembled in
Madinah· at Umar bin Khattab's instance and were sent to Iraq. Some

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

147

of them were those who were the inhabitants of the provinces of
Arabia, which bordered on Iraq and were comparatively near Kufa
and Basra. They embraced Islam at the hands of the Prophet's
companions and then joined the Islamic army and could not establish
a particular link with Madinah nor had they ever seen it. Some were
those whose mother tongue was Arabic but they were the subjects of
the kingdom of fire-worshippers and then converted to Islam, they
found the Islamic way congenial to them and became its supporters
from the core of their hearts and fought against the Iranians on behalf
of the Muslims. Some were dignitaries of the 'Muhajirs' (Emigrants)
and 'Ansars' (Helpers) of Madinah. When Kufa was made a
cantonment for the army and the deputy of the caliph and the
commander-in-chief of the Iraqi army began to live in Kufa, the citydwellers of many cities of Iran were forced by necessity to establish a
. rapport with the capital of Kufa and because of this groups of Iranians
began to live there. Compared to the ascetic lives of the Arabian
deserts, the royal and victorious lives of the victors of the countries of
Kisra, Nausherewan, Kekaus and Kekhusru in Kufa must have been
very pleasant indeed: the excess of spoils of war must have
contributed its part in enticing them. The greater part of the army
acquired land and settled there. Through this evolution, Kufa not only
remained a temporary cantonment and retreat but also turned into a
big city very quickly and finally, it assumed the status of Iraq's capital.
As the population consisted mainly of soldiers and lacked the facilities
of learning and teaching, disciplining of morals and self, the
temperament and morality of the city, on the whole, was prone to
constant change. It is easy to understand that in such a place
knowledge and wisdom, thought and understanding cannot be found
but sentiments and emotions can be amply utilized. The Kufans
therefore always remaine,d under the control of their emotions and
whatever they did it was under the influence of their emotions.
That was why whosoever wanted to incite them, succeeded, and
whosoever wanted to entice them, did not fail. Whenever they were
threatened, they were terrified; and whenever they were goaded to
oppose anyone, they obliged. Whenever they were made bold, they
turned so and whenever they were made to betray, they did
accordingly; and whenever they were reminded of their old loyalty,

148

History of Islam

they began to fulfill its conditions:
Kufa had a plethora of emotions but lacked intelligence. It had
emotions, not sense; it had a tumult of emotions but ran short of
serenity of thought. Therefore, Kufa was expected to do that which
happened. When a few generations passed and the events of the
world endowed the heterogeneous elements by chemical
arnalgaMotion with a particular shape to its temperament, making
Kufa, the old mercurial nature gradually vanished.

Abdul Malik bin Marwan
Abdul Malik bin Marwan bin Hakam bin Abu! Aas bin Umayya bin
Abd · Shams bin Abd Manaf bin Qussai bin Kilab was born in
Ramadan 23 A.H. His familiar name (Arabic: kunya) was Abu
Waleed. He was also known as Abu! Mulook (father of kings) because
several of his sons sat on the throne in succession. Yahya Ghassani
says:" Abdul Malik was accustomed to sitting near Umm Darda (.'iii ,?J
4--,~) . Once she asked, 'I have heard that you have taken to drinking
after being a devotee.' He replied, 'I have turned into a blood-sucker
too.' Nafi' says: "No youth in Madinah was as active, wise, conversant
with the Qur' an and Hadith, religious and ascetic as Abdul Malik."
Abu Zanad says: "Sayeed bin Al-Musayyib, Abdul Malik bin
Marwan, 'Urwah bin Zubair and Qabisah bin Zuwaib are the scholars
of Islamic jurisprudence of Madinah." Ubada bin Muthanna asked,
lbn Umar (-= .'iii <?;). "Whom should we consult for verdicts (Literally
questions. This refers to questions about Islamic law)" He replied,
"Marwan's son is a 'faqih'. You should ask him" .
One day when Abdul Malik called on Abu Huraira (w- .'iii<?;), he said,
"One day this man will become the king of' Arabia". Umm Darda(,?;
~ .'iii) said to Abdul Malik, "I knew beforehand that you would be a
king." He asked, "How?" She said, "I did not find anyone better than
you both as a speaker and as a listener." Sha'bi says: "Who ever sat in
my company became an admirer of my superior knowledge but I have
become an admirer of Abdul Malik's excellent knowledge. Whenever
I narrated a 'hadith', he always added something to it, and whenever I
recited a Verse, he also recited Verses dealing with the same theme.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

149

Dhhbi says, "Abdul Malik heard' Ahadith' (traditions of the Prophet
~ ) from Uthman (= .11._,..;,J), Abu Hurairah (= .11 ..,;,J), Abu Sayeed (..,;,J
.__... .11), Umm Salamah (lp .11._,..;,J), Barirah (= .11 ..,;,j) Ibn 'Umar (.11 ._,..;,J
~ ) and Muawiya ('"" .11._,..;,) while Urwa; Khalid bin Sa' dan, Raja bin
Haiwa, Zuhri, Yunus bin Maisara. Rabia bin Yazid, .I smail bin
Obaidullah, Jarir bin Uthman heard traditions from Abdul Malik.
Yahya Ghassani says: "When Muslim bin Oqaba arrived in Madinah, I
went to Masjid Nabawi and sat beside Abdul Malik. He asked me
whether I was also in his army. I replied in the affirMotive. He said:
"You have raised your arm against the person who was the first born
of all the emigrants of Islam. He is the erophet' s Companion and a
descendent of Datun-Nitaqain and for whom the Prophet (~) did
'Tahneek' (This is the process of chewing dates for a new born infant.
In this section Abdul Malik bin Marwan is referring to Abdullah bin
Zubair = .iii ._,..;,J) - And the greatest thing I observed about him was that
whenever I met him in the day, I found him observing fast and
whenever I met him at night, I always found him standing in 'Salat'
(prayer) . Remember! Who ever fights against him, will be thrown
upside down into Hell by Allah." However, when Abdul Malik sat on
the throne, he sent Hajjaj to fight against •Abdullah bin Zubair (.11._,..;,J
=) and Hajjaj killed him.
Juraij says that following Abdullah bin Zubair's martyrdom, Abdul
Malik delivered the following sermon he said:
"l am neither a weak caliph like Uthman (= 11 ..,;,j) nor a lazy caliph
like Muawiya ( ~ 11 ._,..;,j) nor a caliph with weak opinions like Yazid.
All the caliphs before me had been eating from treasure (under their
possession) I will remedy it with my sword onJy. You should raise
your spears in my support. You hold me responsible to act as the
'Muhajirun' acted yet you yourselves do not act as they did.
Remember, I shall torture you to death and the sword will be the
judge between you and me. Keep watching what my sword makes of
you. I shall tolerate all that you say but I cannot stand your opposition
to the ruler. I shall tie their acts around their necks without hearing
those who threaten with Allah's fear."
It was Abdul Malik who first covered the Ka'bah with a silk curtain.
Somebody said to him, "Amir al-Muminin! You have aged fast." He

150

History of Islam

said, "Why not? I spend my best wisdom on the people every Friday."
When another person asked him, "Who is the best among men?" He
replied, " He who though enjoying high status, shows his humility,
prefers renunciation of the world though powerful, and does justice
though in authority." When a man who did not know him visited him,
he used to tell him, "Keep in mind four things: first, don't tell a lie for
l hate it very much; second, answer what I ask; third, don't praise me
for I know what I am; and fourth, don't incite me jn respect to my
subjects for they need my kindness."
Madaini says, "When Abdul Malik was sure of his death, he said, "I
have been longing to be a ascetic since my birth." Then he called his
son Waleed and exhorted him to fear Allah and avoid internal
dissensions and said:
"Be active in war, be an example in good deeds, for war does not call
death before its time. Good deeds ensure a good reward and Allah
helps in distress. Be soft in hard situations and shun inviting
resentment for a single arrow can easily be broken by anyone but none
can break arrows when they are tied together. 0 Waleed! I make you
caliph and in this matter, you must have fear of Allah. Take care of
Hajjaj who ha& delivered you the caliphate consider him to be your
right hand and sword, he will safeguard you against your foes: don't
listen to anyone's complaint against him; and remember! you need
Hajjaj more than he needs you and when I die, take 'bay'at' from all
and cut off the head of he who refuses."
When he was in the agonies of death, Waleed came to him and began
to weep. Abdul Malik said, "What is the use of weeping like a girl?
Get ready after my death and put your sword on your shoulder with
courage and chop off the head of the man who raises his head
even a little, and spare him who keeps silent for he w o uld die of
his own disease."
Abdul Malik died in S)lawwal 86 A.H. at the age of 63. lhalbi says that
Abdul Malik used to say, "I was born in Ramadan; I was weaned in
Ramadan; it was in Ramadan that I finished the Qu' ran; in Ramadan I
attained the age of discretion; in Ramadan I was made the heir
apparent; in Ramadan I was made caliph and I am afraid I shall die in
Ramadan." But when the month of Ramadan passed he was relieved

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

151

but he died in Shawwal (the month following Ramadan).
One day a woman came to Abdul Malik and said, "My brother has died
leaving six hundred dinars. I am being given only one dinar in
inheritance and was told that I deserve only this much." He
immediately called Shabi and asked him about it. He said, "The
distribution is quite right. The deceased has left two daughters. They get
two-thirds, that is 400 dinars and the mother gets one-sixth, that is 100
dinars, the wife one-eighth, that is 75 dinars and 12 brothers will each be
getting 24 dinars. Therefore she will get only one dinar at this rate."

Important Events of Abdul Malik's Caliphate
Following Abdullah bin Zubair's martyrdom, Abdul Malik made
Hajjaj bin Yusuf the Governor of the Hijaz. Hajjaj pulled down the
Ka'bah and removed the part constructed during Abdullah bin Zubair' s
regime, then he reconstructed it. Hajjaj perpetrated untold atrocities on
the venerated Sahabah. Anas ~ and other distinguished Sahabah were
tied and whipped . He had great hostility for the illustrious Sahabah like
Abdullah bin Umar (= .'iii 1.,<""J) because he was always frank and loved
the truth. Hajjaj' s government did not overawe him nor did anything
deter him from introducing people to good deeds and preventing them
from sin. Hajjaj deputed a man to attack and kill him. As a consequence
of this order, during the next Hajj when Abdullah bin Umar (t..+<- 11..,?;)
was making Tawaf (circumambulation) of the Ka'bah, Hajjaj's agent
pierced his foot with a spear. He succumbed to the injury and died after
a few days. Just as the tyrannies that he perpetrated on the Sahabah
prove him to be a tyrant, similarly they also make Abdul Malik guilty
because it was he who made such an oppressor the Governor of
Makkah and Madinah. Hajjaj and Abdul Malik both had some virtues
and they had vices in proportion to them.

The Mischief of the Khawarij
At the time when lbn Zubair's caliphate showed signs of decline and
Abdul Malik bin Marwan's agents began propaganda and
conspiratorial activities against him in Iraq and Iran, a group of the
Khawarij who had been living peacefully in the Iranian provinces,
started to become awake and active. Mus'ab bin Zubair's murder and

152

History of Islam

the domination of Abdul Malik led the people harboring rebellious
thoughts to begin to whisper. After the occupation of Iraq, Abdul
Malik made Khalid bin Abdullah the Governor of Basra. When Abdul
Malik left Iraq and went .to Damascus, he wasn't able to concentrate
on the 'khawarij' because the Hijaz and Abdullah bin Zubair (11 ,.?J
-=) demanded his attention more. Becoming free from the problems in
the Hijaz after Abdullah bin Zubair' s murder, he dismissed the
Governors of Basra and Kufa and replaced them with his brother
Bishr bin Marwan and insfructed him to send Muhallab bin Abi Sofra
to Iran to fight against the Khawarij so that he might exterminate them
wherever he found them. ,He also ordered that Muhallab should be
authorized to select Basraites and take them with him. Another strong
army from among the Kufans was prepared and sent to help
Muhallab so that he could stamp out their disruption completely.
These same orders were also sent to Muhallab directly. Bishr bin
Marwan didn't like the fact that the Amir al-Muminin assigned
Muhallab directly. He expected that the mission of disciplining and
finishing the Khawarij with the power of assignments, be under his
own command and should have been entrusted to him. Muhallab bin
Abi Sofra, in compliance with Abdul Malik' s orders, left Basra with an
army. Bishr bin Marwan from Kufa sent an army under the command
of Abdur Rahman bin Mukhnaf to help Muhallab. At the time of
departure, _!}e said to Abdur Rahman: "I consider you to be a more
able commander than Muhallab. Don't always keep yourself
subservient to Muhallab you should sometimes assert and impose
your own opinion on him also."
Abdur Rahman met Muhallab at Dar Hurmuz but encamped with his
army separately and began to show signs of his independence. After a
few days, news reached there that Bishr bin Marwan died and at the
time of his death, he had put Khalid bin Abdullah in his place.
Hearing this news, the Basraites and Kufans returned to their
respective cities. Khalid bin Abdullah tried to make them see reason
and even threatened them, but none of them was ready to return to
Muhallab. The conditions in Khorasan, on the other hand, were
turning from bad to worse. Following Abdullah bin Hazin's death as
mentioned previously, the king of Turkistan and Mongolia named
Ratbeel began to make military patrols on the border of Khorasan.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

153

Abdullah bin Hazim's son Musa bin Abdullah along with his father's
men fled and took shelter in the fort of Termiz (city in southern
Uzbekistan) and succeeded in establishing _a separate autonomous state.
Musa bin Abdullah fought and defeated the Turks and at the same
time was at war with the governors of Abdul Malik. Bukair bin
Washah was the governor of Khorasan. Abdul Malik dismissed him
and sent Umayya bin Abdullah bin Khalid in his place. Upon his
arrival to Merv, one of the major cities of Khorasan, Bukair bin
Washah who had been dismissed by Abdul Malik remained in
Khorasan . Umayya bin Abdullah put him in charge of the city of
Merv. Umayya then went to Balkh, another major city in Khorasan,
and attacked Ratbeel and forced him into an agreement, that he would
not invade the Muslims in future . After the agreement he left Balkh
and while- he was returning to Merv, he was attacked by Musa bin
Abdullah bin Hazim, but he somehow managed to escape and arrived
at Merv. Musa bin Abdullah retreated. When he reached Merv, he
saw that Bukair bin Washah had occupied it and was prepared for
war. A skirmish took place between Bukair and Umayya then Bukair
bin Washah settled down for a possible siege after fortifying the city.
Finally, after a few days, they were reconciled. Umayya bin Abdullah,
by promising him the governorship of apart of Khorasan, took Merv
out of his clutches.
At Dar Hurmuz, Muhallab and Ibn Makhnaf with the small armies
that were left with them, after the desertion of the Kufans and
Basraites upon the death of Bishr bin Marwan, were at war with the
Khawarij and following the withdrawal of their troops were placed in
a critical situation. Under these circumstances, Abdul Malik thought it
proper to shift Hajjaj bin Yusuf Thaqfi from the governorship of Hijaz
and appointed him the governor of Iraq. Therefore, in 75 A.H . he
endowed him with the authority to rule Basra and Kufa and sent him
to Kufa. He entered Kufa in Ramadan in 75 A.H. sat on the 'mimbar'
(usually some steps or other raised podium from where the leader of
the prayer on Friday gives his sermon or "kutbah") of the Jama Masjid
(Central Mosque) and ordered the people to assemble there.
The Kufans were accustomed to be rude to their rulers. They used to
humiliate their Amirs' and governors. They, therefore, came with

154

History of Islam

pebbles iri their hands with the intention of throwing them at the new
Amir. But when Hajjaj began his speech, they were terrified and the
pebbles in their hands dropped to the floor. Hajjaj in his speech said,
"A lot of turbans and beards are visible here but very soon they
are going to be wet with blood. Many heads are present in this
assembly, which will soon be chopped off. Amir al-Muminin
Abdul Malik examined his quiver and selecting the hardest and
the most deadly arrow, shot it at you, in other words, he
imposed me on you as your ruler. I will remedy all your ills and
lack of discipline and straighten you out completely. You have
been the center of much trouble and disruption. Now the time
has come for you to be taught a lesson and your eyes to be
opened. Amir al-Muminin has given instructions to disburse
your salaries ;md send you to Muhallab to face the Khawarij.
After the disbursement of the salaries, you are given three days
time. If even a single soul is visible on the fourth day in Kufa,
his head will be severed. Remember this is not an empty threat.
You will yourselves see with your own eyes. I do what I say."
Hajjaj stood up and went to Darul Emarah (the Amir's headquarter)
and began to disburse their salaries. An old man who was shaking
due to his old age came and said, "I am an old man. My son is
younger than I. Please send him in my place." Hajjaj asked him "What
is your name?" He said, "Umair bin Dabi Barjami." Hajjaj said," Are
you the same Umair bin Dabi who had attacked Uthman bin Affan's
house?" He said, "Yes." Hajjaj said, "What persuaded you to do such
a thing?" He said, "Uthman (= .:., s?J) had imprisoned my father when
he was very old." Hajjaj said, "I don't like for you to remain alive." He
ordered that he should be killed and his house ransacked.
On the third day it was announced: "Whosoever stays in his house
tonight anq does not proceed to join Muhallab's army, he will be
slain." Hearing that people began to set out and very soon, a strong
army assembled to face the Khawarij under Muhallab's command.
Hajjaj then appointed Hakam bin Ayyub Thaqfi the Amir of Basra and
sent him there. He deputed Sayeed bin Aslam bin Zur'a to go to the
Sindh. Muawiya bin Harith Kala bi and his brother Mohammad were
part of this army, they brought most of the cities of the area under

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

155

their control, and killed or imprisoned the enemy and after
accomplishing this, Muawiya bin Harith and his brother Muhammad
killed Sayeed.
Hearing the news, Hajjaj sent Maja' a bin Sayeed bin Zur' a who captured
the territory and after a year of his rule brought under his control most
of the cities of Makran (coastal area that is part of modem Iran and
Pakistan) and Darabeel which are adjacent to the Sindh.
Hajjaj made arrangements for Kufa and deputed Urwa bin Mughira
bin Sho'ba as his deputy there and he proceeded to Basra. At Basra, he
delivered the same kind of lecture he had delivered in Kufa and
threatened the deserters of Muhallab.
Sharik bin 'Amr Yeshkuri came to Hajjaj and said, "I am suffering
from the hernia. Bishr bin Marwan accepted this excuse. Will you
please accept it also and exempt me from going to Muhallab's army."
Hajjaj instantly ordered his execution. Seeing that all the Basraites
were afraid and began to get ready to join Muhallab.
After expelling the people from Basra and Kufa, Hajjaj also moved
towards Muhallab's army. When Muhallab's cantonment was at a
distance of 18 miles, he encamped and said, "O Kufans and Basraites!
You will stay here unless the Khawarij are totally exterminated." The
next order Hajjaj issued created trouble for himself.
The salaries of the army during Mus'ab bin Zubair's regime had been
enhanced at the rate of 100 dirhams per head and that increment was
still in force and no one had a thought of curtailing it. Hajjaj ordered
that all of them should be getting the same salaries they had been
getting before Mus'ab bin Zubair's regime, in other words, 100
dirhams per head would be reduced. When Abdullah bin Jarood
heard the order, he said, "Our salaries were allowed to continue by
Abdul Malik and Bishr bin Marwan. Don't commit the mistake of
reducing it."
Hajjaj did not pay any heed to Jarood's advice. He again raised his
voice against J:Iajjaj's order. Masqala bin Karb Abdi said to Abdullah
bin Jarood, "It is our duty to comply with the amir' s order. It is
unbecoming of us to oppose it." Abdullah bin Jarood left Hajjaj' s court
abusing Masqala. He went to Hakeem bin Majashi and told him what

156

History of Islam

took place. He also supported Abdullah. Then most of the soldiers
became Jarood's supporters and all of them took an oath at his hands
for the purpose of having Hajjaj dismissed and expelled from Iraq. All
those under Jarood' s command, surrounded Hajjaj' s tent.
Hajjaj had only a few persons with him and he was about to be killed
or captured but evening set in and they decided to postpone their
action and they all returned to their camps. They did not want to kill
Hajjaj they only wanted to e:,xpel him from Iraq.
At night Hajjaj's friends advised him to leave and go to Abdul Malik.
He was in a quandary. Meanwhile there was dissension among his
enemies and Abbad bin Haseen Habti became angry with lbn Jarood
and went over to Hajjaj's side. Then Qutaiba bin Muslim Sabra bin Ali
Kalabi, Sayeed bin Aslam Kalabi, Jafar bin Abdur Rahman bin
Makhnaf Azdi followed suit. In short, six thousand people rallied
round him by morning and at that time, there was a fierce battle
between the two opposing sides.
Hajjaj and his men wer~ beaten and Abdullah bi!:'- Jarood was
victorious but unfortunately, an arrow hit Abdullah in the neck
causing instant death. With his death, Hajjaj' s defeat turned into
victory. Many of Jarood's men were killed and many asked for
security of life for surrender and rejoined his army. Hajjaj cut off
eighteen heads of Jarood' s main supporters and sent the heads to
Muhallab. Muhallab had them fixed on the heads of spears to
intimidate the Khawarij. While the fight between Hajjaj and Jarood
was going on news came from Basra that a tribe of Sowan named Zanj
that had settled in the vicinity of Basra, turned rebellious.
F.

After the killing of Ibn Jarood, Hajjaj gave a small army to his son
Hafs to discipline them. He wrote to his deputy in Kufa to send an
army to stamp out the new uprising. After several encounters, it was
put down.
The groups of Khawarij drawn from the cities of Iran, Khorasan and
Iraq, had assembled at Dar Hurmuz to face Muhallab and were busy
trying to fight and defeat him and then to capture Basra.
When the supporting armies from Basra and Kufa started arriving in
quick succession, Muhallab and Abdur Rahman bin Makhnaf who

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

157

stood against the Khawarij, received a boost. Prior to that, they were
fighting defensively due to a shortage of soldiers and had stopped the
Khawarij from advancing. However, after becoming stronger, they
began to fight offensively and pushed the Khawarij back to Garzoon.
The Khawarij entrenched and fortified themselves near Garzoon and
began to figDt. Seeing this, Muhallab had a moat dug and made a
defensive wall around his cantonment. Abdur Rahman kept his army
aloof from Muhallab, from the beginning of the engagement. He had
also established his own cantonment.
Muhallab sent word to Abdur Rahman that there was a danger of a
night attack and so it was advised to dig a moat out around his
cantonment. Abdur Rahman replied that he should rest assured; their
swords would serve as a moat. He encamped on an open field.
One night the Khawarij attacked !vfuhallab but because of the moat
they could not advance against him. Having failed there, they moved
towards Abdur Rahman. The way was open and clear. They kept
advancing and started killing. The sleeping soldiers could not
withstand the attack and fled in all directions. Abdur Rahman along
with only a few soldiers were able to fight and he was killed along
with his soldiers at the hands of the Khawarij.
Muhallab and Abdur Rahman were two commanders, Muhallab' s
army consisted of the Basraites and Abdur Rahman' s army was made
up of Kufans. The Kufan army suffered a great loss. The news reached
Hajjaj and he deputed Attab bin Warqa in place of Abdur Rahman
and clearly instructed him that he should remain under Muhallab' s
command and obey him. Attab resented this and it led to a rift
between them.
Attab wrote to Hajjaj to recall him. Hajjaj accepted his request. Then
all the Kufans were placed directly under Muhallab' s command.
Muhallab deputed his own son Habib bin Muhallab to take command
of the Kufan army and they were stationed at Nishapur for a year, and
continued fighting against the Khawarij. Later there erupted some
discord among the Khawarij and they began to fight in two groups.
Muhallab did not attack them at that time but was patient. Then one
faction fought and expelled the other towards Tabristan, Muhallab

attacked the victorious group and killed them. So, in 77 A.H. he was
finally able to get rid of the disruption of the Khawarij.
The Khawarii were such valiant fighters that sometimes they defeated
an army ten or twenty times their number. Once one thousand
Khawarij made an army of fifty thousand retreat near Kufa.
It was Muhallab alone, who was a hundred percent successful against
the Khawarij. When he returned to Hajjaj in Kufa after the victory,
Hajjaj held a grand court and made the Muhallab sit by his side.
Muhallab had seven sons and all of them had shown exemplary valor
against the Khawarij . As a reward, they were given an increment of
two thousand dirhams per year.
Hajjaj sent an army after the run away Khawarij and defeated them
near Tabristan. In 76 AH, another group of the Khawarij, under the
leadership of Saleh bin Masrah, staged an uprising. Abdur Malik's
brother Muhammad bin Marwan, the Amir of Mosil, deputed an army
to deal with it. After many encounters, Saleh was killed. His place was
taken by Shabib who took his group to Madain. Hajjaj started sending
other troops after them but he could not suppress them. Shabib had
only one thousand men. Once he stayed in Kufa unchallenged along
with his men and then left. Hajjaj sent fifty thousand men to face those
one thousand men and the smaller force routed the larger one. Finally,
those one thousand men along with their chief Shabib were
annihilated.

Hajjaj and Muhallab Honored
For Abdul Malik bin Marwan, the greatest danger next to Abdullah
bin Zubair (~ .1, ~;) was the challenge of the Khawarij. Had he
remained indifferent to Khawarij and had he not taken their threat
seriously and had he not become busy planning their extermination,
then the provinces of Khorasan, Iraq a_n d Persia would have gone out
of his hands. No one was better suited for the governorship of Iraq to
put down the rebellions than Hajjaj. He came to Iraq and fulfilled his
obligations excellently. The selection of Muhallab for disciplining the
Khawarij was also right. Then after years of struggle and crowned
with success he handed over to Hajjaj' s control Kufa and Basra, which

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

159

included Khorasan and Sajistan but excluding the rest of Iraq. He
made Hajjaj the leader of all the Islamic countries of the east. Hajjaj
then made Muhallab bin Abi Sofra and Obaidullah bjn Abu Bakra the
Amirs of Khorasan and Sajistan respectively. Muhallab, up to this point
a famous general, was honored by being made the Amir of Khorasan.
Muhallab lived in Basra until 80 A.H. and sent his son Habib, as the
Amir of Khorasan on his own behalf. He went to Khorasan and in
accordance with his father's instructions did not disturb Umayya bin
Abdullah and his staff nor did he reduce their honor. Hajjaj married
Muhallab's daughter Hind bint Muhallab and in this way, he came to
be related to Hajjaj.
In 80 A.H., Muhallab himself went to Khorasan and took over the
reign of the country and taking five thousand men advanced towards
Mawaraunnahr (between the Amu [Oxus] and Syr rivers in modern
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) and surrounded Kush city. At that time,
the relative of the king of Khu tan came to him and asked for help.
Muhallab sent his son Yazid to accompany him. Yazid killed the king
of Khutan and gave the territory to his relative and received a written
agreement, in keeping with his father's instructions, he returned.

It was during that same period Muhallab gave four thousand men to
his son, Habib, to invade Bukhara. The governor of Bukhara fought
against these four thousand men, the result was a victory for Habib
and defeat for the people of Bukhara. Habib returned to Muhallab
with a large amount of spoils of war. The siege of Kush continued for_
two years. At last, the besieged decided it :-vas better to pay the 'jizya'
(a tax on non Muslims under Islamic rule which exonerates them from
military service) and Muhallab, following the reconciliation, returned
from there.

The Betrayal of the People of Kush city and
Huraith bin Qatna
When Muhallab came to Merv, the capital of Khorasan and then
moved to the city of Kush, he left Mughira his son as Amir in his
absence. While the siege of Kush was continuing, the news of
Mughira's death reached Muhallab. Muhallab deputed his son, Yazid
as the Administrator of Merv and sent him there with thirty men.

160

History of Islam

When he reached a pass near Bast, he confronted a raiding party of
five hundred Turks. The Turks demanded all their possessions. Yazid
refused. At last, one of his associates made them agree to take a little
money. They took it and went away but immediately returned and
told Yazid and his troops that they would not be spared without
surrendering all their belongings.
Yazid with his thirty men fought with them and killed their leader
and forced them to run away. Upon his arrival in Merv, he began to
rule in place of his brother. A short time after that incident, Muhallab
made peace with the people of Kush and returned. It was agreed that
the inhabitants of Kush would hand over their king's sons to the
Muslims and they would remain in their custody urfiil the inhabitants
of Kush paid the agreed amount to the Muslims. Muhallab had left
· Huraith bin Qatna there to collect the amount and return the boys.
When Muhallab left Kush and arrived at Balkh, he sent word to Yazid
and Huraith bin Qatna: " Don't return the boys after collecting the
payment until you enter Balkh."
Muhallab's intention was to warn of the danger, which Huraith had to
face. Huraith at once showed the letter to the people of Kush and said
to them, "If you pay me the amount of 'jizya' at once, I shall hand over
your boys to you now and tell Amir Muhallab that I had giyen back
the boys to the people of Kush after collecting the amount, before this
letter reached me." The people of Kush paid the money and took back
the boys.
Upon his return from Kush, the marauding Turks treated Huraith in
the same way they had treated Yazid. There was a fight and many of
Huraith's men were killed and many were captured and they were
released,., only after paying a ransom. When Harith reached Muhallab,
the latter had him lashed twenty times for violating his orders. After
the punishment, he swore that he would kill Muhallab. When
Muhallab came to know of it, he sent for Huraith' s brother Thabit bin
Qatna and made him understand the situation in a calm way. He
called .Harith to him and Huraith repeated his impertinent oath.
Muhallab ignored it and dismissed him. Huraith and Thabit feared for
their positions and taking their three hundred men with them, fled

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

161

from him and went to Musa bin Abdullah bin Hazim at Termiz. Musa
bin Abdullah, as mentioned earlier had founded an independent
state and was at war with the governor of Khorasan. This took place
in82 A.H.

Muhallab's Death and His Will
Muhallab was shocked at his son Mughira's death. He did not live
long after he arrived back in Merv. In the later months of 82 A.H., he
died of a disease in Merv. His valor, good nature and loyalty were
well known. His character was never involved in a breach of trust,
disloyalty or rebellion. He thought it essential to obey and comply
with the orders of the Amir of the time. At the time of his death he
made his son Yazid the Governor of Khorasan and the other son the
Imam (leader) of the Salat (prayer) . He called all his sons to him and
exhorted them saying:
" I want you to fear Allah and treat your relatives kindly, for
these acts prolong life, increase wealth and offspring. I warn
you against giving up the fear of Allah and kind treatment for
their renunciation leads to Hell, causes disgrace and decreases
offspring. It is compulsory for you to obey the Amir and agree
with the Muslims. It is fitting that your: actions be better than
your words. A void answering impulsively and safeguard your
tongue from a slip, for a man can controls the slip of the feet but
the slip of the tongue ruins him. Give the people their dues
because this just and equitable action is better than sitting and
gossiping in the morning and in the evening and talking
uselessly: Don't be deceived by flatterers, prefer generosity to
miserliness, revive goodness and try to do good, be active and
alert in war and for this valor is necessary. When there is a
confrontation, destiny or death falls from heaven. If the.man is
prepared to act and acts cleverly, he achieves success. If he gets
nervous, he fails but Allah's Order dominates all. Make the
recitation and learning of the Qur' an, the application of the
'Sunnah', and respect for the pious compulsory for yourself.
Avoid talking unnecessarily at meetings."

History of Islam

Hajjaj bin Yusuf and Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad
It has been mentioned above that in 78 A.H., Hajjaj had deputed
Muhallab and Obaidullah bin Abi Bakra as governors of Khorasan,
and Sajistan and Sindh respectively. Sindh and Sajistan had
continuously been under attack by the Hindus from the east and by
the Turks and the Mongols from the north. Hence, Hajjaj gave
Hamyan bin Adi an active, agile and well-armed division of an army
and stationed them at Kerman (city, provincial capital, and province
in southeastern Iran) with the instructions to help the Governors of
Sajistan and Sindh when needed. Obaidullah bin Abi Bakra arrived in
his province and became busy with its affairs. Hamyan bin Adi, seeing
a big army under his command at Kerman, rebelled and instead of
helping Obaidullah, started attacking his province. When informed,
Hajjaj sent Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad bin Ash'ath to discipline
Hamyan bin Adi. Abdur Rahman defeated and drove him away and
after staying for a few days at Kerman returned. It has been
mentioned above that the king of Turkistan named Ratbeel had made
peace with the Muslims by promising them to pay taxes. When
Obaidullah came, he continued to pay him the taxes but then
prepared to rebel against him. Ratbeel controlled Badakhshan,
Kafiristan and Afghanistan up to Tibet. Obaidullah invaded his
territory. He fled and lured Obaidullah into following him and took
him to a place where the journey was very arduous. Finally, the
Muslims were surrounded inside the passes of a very mountainous
area. Many were killed. Shuraih bin Hani was also killed there. Those
who returned, were in a very miserable condition. When Hajjaj was
informed of the destruction of the army, he reported to Abdul Malik
and sought his permission to invade Ratbeel's territory. Abdul Malik
granted the permission and Hajjaj took twenty thousand men from
Kufa and twenty thousand infantry from Basra and made Abdur
Rahman. bin Mohammad bin Ash' ath the commander of these veteran
armies. Meanwhile news arrived of the death of Obaidullah bin Abi
Bakra in Sajistan.

Hajjaj granted Abdur Rahman credentials and a certificate of
Governorship of Sajistan and sent him to invade Ratbeel's territory.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

163

When Abdur Rahman arrived there with the Islamic forces and
Ratbeel was informed of it, Ratbeel was extremely nervous but could
do nothing about it. Abdur Rahman began to conquer his country and
took care to depute guards near passes and valleys as he moved
forward. In short, he conquered half of his country and postponed a
further advance until the following year. He informed Hajjaj of the
victory by letter and also told him that the rest of the country
remained to be conquered which would be done the following year so
that he could consolidate his position and manage the affairs of the
conquered territory efficiently and the army could also be refreshed.
Hajjaj was very angry when he read the letter. He at once ordered him
to continue his advance, slay Ratbeel's soldiers in captivity and pull
down their forts. He had written a second and third letter of the same
content before the-first one reached him. In the third letter he said: "If
you obey my order, good; if you disobey, deem yourself dismissed
and your brother Ishaq bin Mohammad bin Ash' ath will be the
commander of the army." Those three orders reached Abdur Rahman
one after another. Abdur Rahman read them and called the army
together and made the following speech:
"I had decided our present strategy after consulting you that we
would manage the conquered territories of the Turks and after
fortifying ourselves and completing the required preparations, we
would conquer the rest of the territory the following year. However,
Hajjaj writes to us to fight with them without making any further
delay. He does not care for your fatigue and the necessity of your
recuperation. This is the same country where o_µr brothers were
destroyed. I am also your brother and a man like you. If you are
ready, fight and move forward. I am also with you.
Hearing the speech, all the Kufans and Basraites flew into a rage and
said in one voice, "We won't obey Hajjaj." Ail bin WaS'ia said, "Hajjaj
is Allah's enemy. Dismiss him and take the oath with Abdur Rahman
bin Ash'ath bin Rabia." All unanimously cried out, "Yes, yes. We all
agree to it." A_bdur Rahman stood up and asked them, "Let us go and
turn Allah's enemy Hajjaj out of our city." Hearing it, all rushed to
take the oath at his hands and all took a pledge that they would not
rest until Hajjaj was expelled from Iraq. At that same time, Abdur

164

History of Islam

Rahman sent word to Ratbeel and an agreement for peace was at once
signed on the condition that if they succeeded in the expulsion of
Hajjaj, all taxes on Ratbeel's territory would be excused. If Hajjaj won,
Ratbeel would prevent Hajjaj's soldiers from entering his country and
fight against him.
The army therefore left the conquered territory and returned to Iraq.
When Hajjaj was informed about it, he wrote to Abdul Malik about
the gravity of the situation and requested him to send an army to help
him. Abdul Malik did accordingly. When Muhallab came to know the
details, he wrote to Hajjaj in support: "Let the Iraqis return home but
for the time don't do anything with them in the least."
Hajjaj did not appreciate his advice he actually came to harbor an ill
feeling against the Iraqis in his heart. He misunderstood Muhallab
and Hajjaj felt that Muhallab being the governor of Khorasan, might
al~o have been• their adviser and was sympathetic to them. When
f,.bdul Malik's army arrived, Hajjaj took it and moved beyond Basra,
and arrived at Tustar (in Khuzestan, an Iranian province at the top of
the Arabian Gulf) and sent ahead a division. Abdur Rahman had also
come nearer. His soldiers defeated and routed Hajjaj's soldiers and
put a good number of them to death.
Thus compelled Hajjaj returned to Basra and turned to a place named
Zawia. Abdur Rahman entered Basra directly. The Basraites took the
oath at his hands. Hajjaj recalled Muhallab' s advice and then realized
that what he had written was quite right. The Basraites were sick of
Hajjaj' s strictness and all were bent on annulling Abdul Malik' s
caliphate and fighting with Hajjaj.
This occurred at the end of Dhul Hijja 81 A.H. Then a series of battles
between Hajjaj and Abdur Rahman started in the beginning of
Ramadan 82 A.H. First Hajjaj won, then Abdur Rahman won.
However, a battle that took place on 29 Muharram 82 A.H. saw
Abdur Rahman badly defeated. He took his defeated men and went to
Kufa and occupied Kufa's Darul Emarah (the Amir's headquarter).
following Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad's defeat, the Basraites took
the oath at the hands of Abdur Rahman bin Abbas bin Rabia bin
Harith bin Abdul Mutallib and continued the chain of battles and

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

165

confrontations with Hajjaj . Abdur Rahman bin Abbas faced Hajjaj
ferociously. His preoccupation with these battles and confrontations
gave a respite to Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad and enabled him to
occupy Kufa. At last, Abdur Rahman bin Abbas, along with a good
number of the Basraites, advanced towards Kufa and joined Abdur
Rahman bin Mohammad. Hajjaj entered Basra and appoint~d Hakeem
bin Ayyub Thaqfi to the post of Governor of Basra, and proceeded
towards Kufa and encamped at Dairqarah. From the other side Abdur
Rahman bin Mohammad came out and made fortifications at Dairjam.
Moats, fortifications and walls were made by both sides and the battle
began. It continued for a long time. Everyday men from both sides
came onto the battlefield and pushed back the other side but they did
not wage a decisive battle. At last, Abdul Malik sent his son Abdullah
and his brother, Muhammad bin Marwan along with a large army to
Kufa and conveyed through them a message to the Iraqis:
"We dismiss Hajjaj. We will fix the salaries of the Iraqis at par with
those of the Syrians and Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad will be given
the Governorship of the province he likes."
The message hurt Hajjaj very much. He stopped Abdullah and
Mohammad from conveying the message and wrote a letter to Abdul
Malik saying, "Your policy will never make the Iraqis your subjects
and they will grow more headstrong." But Abdul Malik disapproved
of Hajjaj' s views and Abdullah and Mohammad communicated his
message to the Iraqis.
To the Iraqis it spelt a great victory and Abdur Rahman bin
Mohammad was ready to recognize it. But the army did not agree to it
and raised its voice against it and renewed its oath for annulling
Abdul M.1lik' s oath. Grasping the situation, both Abdullah and
Mohammad left the army with Hajjaj and returned to Abdul Malik.
Again, the battlr between the parties raged with renewed vigor, fresh
preparations and strategies it continued in this manner for a year.
Daily they came out fought and returned to their bases in the evening.
In those battles, Abdur Rahman had-an edge over his rival Hajjaj who
suffered heavy losses. But Hajjaj continued to receive regular
reinforcements from Syria. At last, onJumad al-Thani 83 A.H. there
was a decisive battle. It went in favor of Hajjaj due to a certain set of

166

History of Islam

accidental occurrences and he at once entered Kufa and occupied it.
Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad returned to Basra and expelled
Hajjaj's governor from there, and captured Basra. Hajjaj started taking
the oath from the Kufans and who ever hesitated, was instantly killed.
Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad collected a large army at Basra and
intended to attack Hajjaj. Hearing this news, Hajjaj took a large Syrian
army and moved towards Basra. The battle began on 1, Shaban 83
A.H. It continued fiercely until 15 Shaban. Hajjaj suffered defeat
several times but he remained steady. Abdul Malik bin Muhallab was
also present in his army. When Abdul Malik bin Muhallab attacked
Abdur Rahman with his men, Abdur Rahman and his men reversed
their position and ransacked Hajjaj' s camp and forced him to runaway
from the battlefield and they returned victorious to their base however
they were stunned and terrified by a sudden attack by Abdul Malik
bin Muhallab. They had to retreat. Many of them died, falling into the
moat and many were killed and many escaped.
Hajjaj who had suffered a defeat returned and occupied Abdur Rahman
bin Mohammad's camp. After being defeated, Abdur Rahman went to
Ratbeel the king of Turkistan, by passing through Sos, Sabur, Kerman,
Ziranj and Bist. Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad's men assembled at
Sajistan and made Abdur Rahman bin Abbas bin Rabia bin Abdul
Mutallib the Imam of their Salats. They called all their colleagues from
all directions and sent word to Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad to
return and occupy Khorasan. He replied that Khorasan was ruled over
by Yazid bin Muhallab and it would not be easy to snatch it from him.
But they insisted and Abdur Rahman yielded to their pressure and he
returned from Ratbeel. They numbered twenty thousand. He took them
to Herat and captured it. Yazid bin Muhallab came with his army. When
they came to face each other, Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad's men
began leaving before the beginning of the battle. Under compulsion, he
fought supported by only a few men. Many were killed and captured.
Abdur Rahman fled to the Sindh. Yazid stopped his army from
pursuing him and Abdur Rahman arrived in Sindh.
Yazid took the captives of Herat to Merv and from there, he sent them
to Hajjaj. Muhammad bin Sad bin Abi Waqaas was also among them
and he was executed by the order of Hajjaj. Abdur Rahman bin

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

167

Ash'ath left Sindh and went to Ratbeel. There he contracted
tuberculosis. Hajjaj wrote to Ratbeel to cut off his head and send it to
him assuring him that he would exempt him from paying taxes for ten
years in lieu thereof. Ratbeel complied, killed Abdur Rahman bin
Muhammad and sent his head to Hajjaj. This took place in 84 A.H.

The Population of the City of Wasit
You have read above that Hajjaj had to ask for help from Abdul Malik
repeatedly in order to face Abdur Rahman bin Muhammad. When
Abdur Rahman came to Sajistan dethroned, Hajjaj had a big Syrian
army under his command. He had no respite from the Kufans and
Basraites because they had fought against him along with Abdur
Rahman bin Mohammad. Therefore keeping the Syrian army with
him for an extended period was very essential. First, Hajjaj issued
instructions to the Kufans to keep the Syrians with them in their
homes. But after a few days, the Syrians started misbehaving with the
Kufan' s women folk. When Hajjaj was informed of it, he thought it
proper to establish a separate military headquarters for the Syrian
army. He therefore constituted a body of veteran soldiers to select a
suitable site for it. They saw an ascetic who was purifying a place.
When he was asked to explain the reason, he replied that they had
read in their scripture that they would build a house of Allah on that
site. They came back to Hajjaj and narrated the incident. Hajjaj built a
mosque there and established a military headquarter around it. That
was the beginning of the city of Wasit. It occurred in 83 A.H.

Yazid bin Muhallab Dismissed
After freeing himself from the problems of Abdur Rahman bin
Mohammad, Hajjaj continued to deal harshly with the Iraqis. He began
to pick out their leaders and murder them. No household of any
significance in Iraq, Kufa and Basra was left where a member was not
killed by Hajjaj's order and they had to suffer humiliation from him.
Only Muhallab's household was spared due to its loyalty to Hajjaj.
Yazid bin Muhallab was the Governor of Khorasan and obedient to
Abdul Malik and Hajjaj. Hajjaj called Yazid to Kufa several times btit
every time he was in the midst of some engagement in Khorasan and
made some excuse and failed to visit Kufa. Hajjaj, who was suspicious

168

History of Islam

by nature misunderstood Yazid and made up his mind to take away
from him of the Governorship of Khorasan. He began to write letters to
Abdul Malik containing complaints against Yazid . Each time Abdul
Malik rwrote back to Hajjaj that Muhallab and his sons were loyal
supporters and they deserved all possible concessions. However, Hajjaj
continued his moves against them. At last getting sick of constant
complaints, Abdul Malik wrote to him, "Since you insist on your
proposal, I permit you to choose anyone you like for the Governorship
of Khorasan. In order to prevent the problem of Khorasan getting
complicated and saving Khorasan from being captured by another
Governor, Hajjaj first of all sent word to Yazid that after handing over
Khorasan to his brother Mofaddal bin Muhallab he should come to him.
Yazid was packing for the journey when he received Hajjaj's order as
well as t.he letter of Governorship in the name of Mofaddal. Yazid said
to his brother "Don't be deceived by this letter of Governorship of
Khorasan although he has appointed you to this post after a short time
he will dismiss you too." Saying this, he left for Merv in Rabia al-Thani
85 A.H. Yazid proved right. Hajjaj dismissed Mofaddal bin Muhallab
after nine months and deputed Qutaiba bin Muslim instead.

Musa,bin Hazim
It has already been mentioned that Musa bin Abdullah bin Hazim had
founded an independent state at Termiz and that Huraith and Thabit,
Qatna Khazai's sons, fled from Muhallab and went to Musa bin
Abdullah at Termiz. When Muhallab became the Governor of Khorasan,
he did not disturb Musa and exhorted his sons," Always leave Musa
alone and forgive him for if there is no Musa, somebody else from
among Banu Qais will be the Governor of Khorasan" When Abdur
Rahman bin Mohammad was defeated by Yazid bin Muhallab at Herat,
Abdur Rahman bin Mohammad and Abdur Rahman bin Abbas' men
who fled from the conflict with Yazid, went directly to Musa bin
Abdullah at Termiz. When Ratbeel chopped off Abdur Rahman bin
Mohammad's head and sent it to Hajjaj, Abdur Rahman' s men fled from
Ratbeel and went to Musa bin Abdullah and took refuge at Termiz. In
this way, Musa bin Abdullah,came to have eight thousand Arabs under
his command. Both brothers, Huraith and Thabit, served as
commanders and Musa bin Abdullah was an independent king. Huraith

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

169

and Thabit said to Musa, "The people of Bukhara and all the Turkish
chiefs are displeased with Yazid bin Muhallab. If we let them be with
us, we can expel Yazid bin Muhallab and occupy Khorasan ourselves.
Musa said, "lf we expel Yazid from Khorasan, some other governor of
Abdul Malik' will occupy it and we will not be able to save Khorasan. lt
is better to expel Abdul Malik' s governors from Turkistan. We then
would be able to maintain our hold on that territory because Abdul
Malik's troops will not have an approach, and the Turks and the
Mongols who are present near the borders will help us." Following this
decision, all the Governors of Abdul Malik were expelled from the area
and Musa bin Abdullah's government became strong and stable.
After a short time the Turks, the Mongols and the Tibetans invaded
Musa's country jointly. The leader of the Turks along with ten thousand
soldiers were stationed on a mound, Huraith bin Qatna attacked them.
The attack was so fierce that the Turks had to take shelter behind the
mound. It was during that confusion and uproar that an arrow hit
Huraith on the forehead. The wound proved fatal and he died after two
days. Because evening had set in, the fight was postponed. The next day
Musa attacked and vanquished the Turks and returned with a good
deal of spoils of war to their fort at Termiz. After the death of Huraith,
his brother Thabit bin Qatna, taking a wrong idea about Musa's
intentions parted with him. He left Termiz and halted at Hoshra and
began to rally the Arabs and non-Arabs round him. When Musa left
with an army to fight with him, the people of Bukhara, Kush and Nasf
stood up in support of Thabit. Musa had to return to Termiz helpless.
After a few days, all the Turks assembled and taking Thabit bin Qatna
with them laid siege to Termiz with a staggering eight thousand
soldiers. Musa defended with great courage. Thabit was killed and the
Turks became disorganized and left raising the siege,.
Only a short time had passed following this confusion when Yazid
bin Muhallab after having been dismissed from the governorship of
Khorasan, left for Kufa and in his place his brother Mofaddal bin
Muhallab was chosen as the governor of Khorasan. Immediately
after taking control he gave an army to Uthman bin Masood and
sent him from Merv to invade Musa bin Abdullah bin Hazim and
wrote to his own brother Mud'rik bin Muhallab who lived in Balkh
to set out with his army to launch an attack on Termiz. Moreover, he

170

History of Islam

wrote to Ratbeel and Tarkhoon, the Turkish kings, to arrive there
with their troops to help Uthman bin Masood. Those Turkish chiefs
who had already grown jealous of Musa and had suffered defeat at
his hands repeatedly, immediately left with their armies for Termiz. His
enemies converged on his territory from four different directions
compelling him to remain besieged in the fort. The siege laid by those
massive armies continued for two months and there was no end in
sight. At last, Musa bin Abdullah said to his men, "We can not exercise
self restraint any more. It is more fitting that we attack the enemies all of
a sudden." All agreed to the proposal. Musa deputed his nephew Nadar
bin Sulaiman in the city and the fort and exhorted him, "If I am killed,
don't surrender the city and the fort to Uthrnan bin Masood rather
surrender them to Mudrik bin Muhallab."
Musa deputed one-third of his men to face Uthrnan with the
instructions not to begin the attack first and taking two-thirds of the
men attacked the flank led by Tarkhoon and Ratbeel. Unable to face
Musa they retreated. Musa chased them for a great distance. When he
returned, the people of Saghad and other Turks blocked his way to the
fort. Renewed fighting began. He was surrounded on all sides.
Uthman bin Masood also turned his attention to him. First Musa's
horse was killed and then he also followed it fighting bravely.
After having ruled over Termiz independently for fifteen years, Musa
who came from the tribe of Qais left this world. Mofaddal wrote the letter
of the good tidings to Hajjaj, but the latter was not happy. Nadar bin
Sulaiman surrendered Termiz to Mudrik and Mudrik gave it to Uthman.

The Beginning of the Islamic Coins
Among the many firsts attributed to Abdul Malik bin Marwan, it was
during his regime that the Muslims for the first time cast and
introduced their own coins. Until then, Roman coins were in currency
in Syria, Arabia and Egypt. In Iraq, the Iranian coins were in use. In
Arabia, there was neither a strong government nor were there Arabic
coins. Roman coins had been in circulation in all those countries since
ancient times. When the Islamic Sultanate was established and it
extended from Balkh and Jaihoon to the Atlantic Ocean, still no one
thought of introducing Islamic coins.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (First Phase)

171

By chance Abdul Malik bin Marwan happened to write a few letters to
the Emperor of Rome. In accordance with the Islamic way, he wrote
"There is no true god but Allah and Muhammad is his Messenger"
and prayers for the Prophet (~ ) on the top of these letters. The
Emperor wrote back to him saying, "Don't mention your Allah and
the Prophet(~ ) on the top of your letters. We don't like it. If you don't
give it up, we will cast in our mint coins, which will be bearing your
Prophet's name in an insulting manner and then send them into
circulation and that will hurt you more."
Abdul Malik was very concerned and disconcerted while going through
that letter. He sought counsel from Khalid bin Yazid bin Muawiya. He
said to him, "Stop the circulation of the Roman coins in your country,
mint your own coins and put them into circulation." Abdul Malik liked
the idea. He set up a mint and had 14-carat dirhams minted which
weighed 5 'mashas' - each. Then Hajjaj had ...1.;>-i 11 r J (Say He is Allah,
One) minted on one side of the dirham and dinar. Abdul Malik
proclaimed that from that time forth only Arabic coins would be
accepted in payment of taxes. By this method, the Arabic dinar and
dirham became circulated in all the countries.
Some points regarding important events remain to be mentioned. For
example, Abdul Malik bin Marwan went on the Hajj pilgrimage for
the first time in 75 A.H. after becoming caliph. In 77 A.H., the fort of
Harqla was conqured. That same year Abdul Malik's brother Abdul
Aziz bin Marwan the Governor of Egypt, pulled down the Jama
Masjid (the Grand or Main Mosque) and reconstructed it and
expanded it from all sides. In 81 A.H., he won Qaliqala from the
Romans. In 82 A.H., the Fort of Senan was brought under possession.
Mofaddal bin Muhallab, the Governor of Khorasan, after becoming
free from the trouble in Khorasan by killing of Musa bin Abdullah,
occupied Badghais. In 84 A.H. Abdullah bin Abdul Malik conqurred
Masisa from the Romans. In 85 A.H. Abdul Aziz bin Abu Hatim bin
Noman Bahli populated the city of Ardabil (town in northwestern
Iran, 38 miles from the Caspian Sea). In Jamad al-Awwal 85 A.H.,
Abdul Malik's brother Abdul Aziz bin Marwan died in Egypt and
Abdul Malik appointed his own son Abdullah, as the Governor of
Egypt in his place.

History of Islam

Succession of Waleed and Sulaiman
Abdul Malik remained engrossed in the thought of how to dismiss
his brother Abdul Aziz from being the heir apparent and install his
own sons in his place. The task was not simple because there was
always the risk of inviting opposition from the people at large.
When he received the news of Abdul Aziz's death, Abdul Malik
found an easy opportunity to see his wish fulfilled. In Ramadan 86
A.H. therefore, he issued commands to all his Governors and
Administrators of the Provinces to take the oath for; Waleed and
Sulaiman on the night of Eid ul Fitr (the holiday following the
fasting of Ramadan), that being the first day of Shawwal. The oath
was taken on the fixed day in all the territories for the succession of
both Waleed and Sulaiman.
The administrator of Madinah was Hisham bin Ismail Makhzumi.
When he asked the inhabitants of Madinah to take the oath, all obeyed
but Sayeed bin Musayyib refused. Hisham had him caught and
lashed, and after he took him in publicity, threw him into prison.
When Abdul Malik found out about it, he wrote Hisham a letter
saying: "You have committed a mistake in dealing harshly with
Sayeed bin Musayyib, because the latter harbors neither animosity nor
opposition nor hypocrisy. Such a person should not have been hurt."

The Death of Abdul Malik bin Marwan
After taking the oath for Waleed and Sulaiman, Abdul Malik did not
live more ,than a month. He died of a disease on Thursday the 15 th of
Shawwal 85 A.H. corresponding to 19 October 705 A.C. Abdul Malik
lived for 13 years 3 months and 23 days following Abdullah bin
Zubair's martyrdom and that was the period of his caliphate. At the
time of his death, he called his sons and exhorted them saying: "I want
you to keep fearing Allah for it is the fear of Allah that is the best
adornment and the best refuge. Your elders ought to have affection for
the youth and the youth should respect the elders. Always honor the
opinion and counsel of the Muslims and avoid opposition because
these are the jaws with which you chew and these are the teeth with
which you bite. Accommodate the wise for they deserve it."

Then he mentioned things, which have been recorded before in the
introductory chapter on Abdul Malik. After that, he breathed his last.
Then the people took the oath at Waleed bin Abdul Malik's hands.
Abdul Malik had 15 or 16 sons and several daughters. Among his
wives were the daughters of Yazid bin Muawiya, the daughter of Ali
('---"' .iii ..,-----;,J) and the daughter of Abdullah bin Jafar (= .iii ...,.;,J)- Waleed
and Sulaiman were born of Walada bint Abbas.

Summary
Abdul Malik bin Marwan was one of the most famous and fortunate
caliphs of the Banu Umayyah. He succeeded in the amalgaMotion of
the entire Islamic world with a strong center. He removed the
dissention that was created following Uthman's martyrdom and reestablished the Islamic government. He adopted stern and violent
measures to do this work and in the way of an excuse, he used to say:
"If Abu Bakr Siddiq(-= .iii ...,.;,J) and Umar bin Khatab (-= 11 ...,.;,J) had to
face such ignorant and headstrong people, they would have done
what I have done." Abdu,\ Malik made the government of Banu
Umayyah firmly rooted, which had become quite uncertain and weak.
Abdul Malik combined in his nature strictness, wisdom and
truthfulness. We have to appreciate his courage and determination.
The major blunder he committed was that he gave Hajjaj more power
and authority than he deserved and Hajjaj employed his tyrannical
measures to the full . But such an error is possible to be committed by a
ruler who wants his government to be firmly established and stabilized.
It was Obaidullah bin Zeyad, Hajjaj bin Yusuf Thaqfi and Muhallab bin
Abi Sofra who were responsible for the series of successes of Abdul
Malik. During his regime, the Muslims conquered many countries and
their bickering and internal conflicts vanished one by one. On the basis
of his achievements during his 13 year long caliphate, he is regarded as
one of the most popular and successful caliphs. He was also a grand and
powerful caliph. He ranks high in respect of knowledge and virtue.
From the viewpoint of valor and military skill, he is counted as one of
the brave and well-known generals. At the juncture of his death, we
have come out of a tempestuous age and entered one that may be
characterized as peaceful and serene.

Chapter 2

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah
(Second Phase)

Waleed bin Abdul Malik
Abul Abbas Waleed bin Abdul Malik bin Marwan was born in 50 A.H.
and at the age of 36, following his father's death, he sat on the throne as
caliph. Since he was brought up in a pampered way, he was deficient in
studies and lacked knowledge and virtue. After the funeral of his father
he went to Central Mosque and delivered a sermon saying:
"O people! No one can push the man into the rear that Allah pushes to
the forefront and no one can push the man to the forefront that Allah
pushes into the rear. Death was in the ancient knowledge of Allah
which He has made inevitable for all the prophets and the righteous,
Allah has made the responsible of this "Ummah" (community) a man
who makes up his mind to discipline the criminals treat the men of
virtue and righteousness mildly and maintain the limits of the Shariah
(system of Islamic law). He has a mind to perform Hajj, declare Jihad
(literally: struggle; In Islam it means fighting or struggling in the way
of Allah) on the borders and to keep attacking the enemies of the
religion. He wants neither to be lazy nor to exceed the limits in this

176

The History of Islam

matter. 0 people obey the caliph and maintain unity among the
Muslims. The man who disobeys will see his head broken and he who
keeps silent will die of his own disease".
The people then took 'bai'ya t', (the oath of allegiance) for the caliphate
at his hands. After he became the caliph, he maintained the status quo
by retaining Hajjaj in a place of authority. Hajjaj appointed Qutaiba
bin Muslim Bahli, the Administrator of Rayy, as the Governor of
Khorasan in place of Mufaddal bin Muhallab. Qutaiba bin Muslim
conquered the territories up to China and Turkistan. In the west Musa
bin Nusayr, the Governor of Africa, extended the Islamic conquest
through Morocco into Spain. Waleed's brother Maslama bin Abdul
Malik won many cities and forts from the Romans.
Mohammed bin Qasim bin Thaqfi who was Hajjaj's nephew and sonin-law conquered the Sindh and India. Waleed appointed his cousin
Umar bin Abdul Aziz the Governor of Madinah Munawwara . He had
the Mosque of the Prophet ~ reconstructed under Umar bin Abdul
Aziz's supervision. He incorporated the Prophet's wives' rooms into
the mosque and expanded it. The Roman Emperor also sent precious
stones and experienced masons as gifts to Waleed. Waleed did a
significant amount of welfare work. He built new roads, opened new
schools in villages and towns, constructed inns, dug wells, started
hospitals and made arrangements for peace and security of the
travelers. Madinah lacked a canal so he had one dug and thus
removed the suffering of Madinah. He started homes for the destitute.
He cared very ·much for redressing the public grievances and
providing them relief of all kinds. During his regime the chain of
conquests continued. No internal feud or rebellion worth mentioning
broke out. The series of victories reminded the people of the days of
Umar bin Khatab (= .1.il ._,..;:,J. Waleed fixed the allowance for the poor
Fuqaha (plural of faqih: man learned in knowledge of the science of
applying the system of Islamic law known as fiqh, and by virtue of his
knowledge can give a legal judgment, fatwa) and Ulama (plural of
Alim, a scholar, particularly in the sciences of Islam) so high that they
became well off and happy. He introduced useful rules and
regulations for the welfare of the people. Waleed dismissed Hisham
bin Ismail Makhzumi and appointed Umar bin Abdul Aziz the

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

177

Governor of Madinah. Immediately after taking office, Umar bin
Abdul Aziz selected ten scholars from among the fuqaha of Madinah.
He began to execute the duties of governor in accordance with the
counsel and advice of the consultative body he formed known as the
Majlis as-Shoora consisting of the ten selected scholars. By allowing the
members of the Majlis as-Shoora to share in the government he set such
an excellent example for the other government officials that the people
of Madinah wrote letters of thanks and blessing to Waleed for
appointing Umar bin Abdul Aziz as Governor.
It was after Waleed bin Abdul Malik's succession to the throne that

Hajjaj accused Yazid bin Muhallab and his brothers of embezzling. In
87 A.H., Maslama bin Abdul Malik attacked the Roman lands via
Masisa and captured the forts of Laulaq, Akhram, Bules and Qamiqam.
In 88 A.H., Jarsumah and Tawanah were conquered. In 89 A.H.,
Maslama bin Abdul Malik and Abbas bin Waleed invaded Roman
territory. A massive Roman army faced them but the Muslims defeated
it on all fronts and forced them to retreat. The Muslims conquered the
forts of Soriya, Ardoliya, Omuriya, Harqula; and Qamruliya. That
same year Maslama bin Abdul Malik invaded the Turks near
Azerbaijan and conquered many forts and cities. In the same year the
islands of Mayorca and Minorca in the Mediterranean Sea off the
coast of Spain were also taken into possession. In 90 A.H., Abbas bin
Waleed captured five strong forts in the territories of Soriya.
In 91 A.H., Waleed dismissed, his uncle Mohammed bin Marwan
from the governorship of Jazirah (Island: The region lies between the
Euphrates and Tigris rivers and is bounded on the south by a line
running between Takrit and Anbar. It is the northern reaches of
Mesopotamia, now making up part of northern Iraq and extending
into eastern Turkey and extreme northeastern Syria) and Armenia
and deputed his own brother Maslama bin Abdul Malik instead. The
Muslims declared a Jihad on the Turks through Azerbaijan and
continued to conquer territory up to Babol (northern Caspian Sea).
That year the forts of Nasf, Kush an,<:! Shoman were conquered by
the Muslims.
In 92 A.H., Maslama bin Abdul Malik conquered three forts and
banished the inhabitants of Sarsina to Roman territory. That same year

178

The History of Islam

Debal was conquered in Sindh. The same year also saw the conquest
of Karkh, Barham, Baja, Baiza, Khawarzim and Sabad.
In 93 A.H., Maslama bin Abdul Malik and Waleed's sons, Abbas and
Marwan, invaded the Roman territory and captured the forts of
Sabitala, Hanjara, Masha, Hisnul Hadeed, Ghazala, and Maltia.
In 94 A.H., Abbas bin Waleed and Abdul Aziz bin Waleed conquered
Antakia and Ghazala respectively, that same year Waleed bin Hisham
Moiti Murooj al-Hamam and Yazid bin Abi Kabsha continued
conquering Soriya respectively. That very year Kabul, Farghana
Shash, and Sindh were conquered.
In 95 A.H., when the inhabitants of Heraqla found the Islamic forces
busy on other fronts they rebelled, Abbas bin Waleed conquered it
again . That same year, Mauqan Madinatul Bab were conquered.
In 96 A.H., Tus (ancient city that is an offshoot of Meshed in Eastern
Iran) and the adjoining territories were conquered. If all the battles
and wars that were fought in Waleed bin Abdul Malik's times are
recorded in detail several volumes of this concise book would not
-·
suffice to cover Waleed's regime alone. Therefore, keeping brevity in
view, the feats of a few famous and victorious generals of Waleed's
times are recorded as a reference so that the readers of this book may
feel ease in taking stock of the condition of Waleed bin Abdul Malik's
regime and that of the Islamic world. Maslama bin Abdul Malik is one
of the victorious generals of Waleed's times whose conquests have
found mention above. Now read the conditions and circumstances of
some of the other generals.

Qutaiba bin Muslim Bahli
Hajjaj deputed Qutaiba bin Muslim Bahli as the governor of Khorasan
in 86 A.H. Qutaiba arrived in Merv and appointed Ayas bin Abdullah
bin Amr the officer of defense and chief of police. He entrusted the
management of finance to Uthman bin Sad. Taking a large army, he
set out towards Talaqan. There the Turkish King of Safad paid a visit
to him and agreed to conform and pay the required taxes and at the
end of the meeting the king induced him to launch an attack on
Akhroon and Shoman which were part of the land of Tagharistan.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

179

_When Qutaiba reached Akhroon and Shoman, their kings agreed to
obey and pay him the taxes and made peace with him. He sent his
brothers Saleh to Farghana and he returned to Merv. Saleh conquered
Kashana Darasht and Akhshakeet in the land of Farghana. In 87 A.H.,
Qutaiba invaded Bukhara. The Turks in the area put up a defense of
the territory but in vain. The Islamic forces collected a large amount of
spoils of war. In 88 A.H., the inhabitants of Safad and Farghana
revolted and making the Chinese king' s sister's son their leader had
gathered a huge army of two hundred thousand and came to face
Qutaiba. He fought and defeated them and returned to Merv. In 89
A.H., the chiefs of Bukhara Kush, Nasf and Safad jointly rebelled.
They were also defeated unconditionally and compelled to surrender.
In 90 A.H. Durdan, the king of Bukhara and the king of Saf~d and the
Turkish chiefs of the surrounding territories were prepared to rebel
but Nizak Turkhan, the prince of Badghais remained loyal to the
Muslims. Qutaiba, taking Turkhan with him, moved towards
Bukhara, the Turks fought bravely. They at first vanquished the local
vanguard but when the Islamic forces steadied and attacked, they
captured the Turkish positions. The Turk's leader and his son were
wounded and escaped and the Muslims scored a major victory.
Tarkhoon, the king of Safad agreed to pay the Jizya annually and
Qutaiba returned to Merv. (Jizya : A tax paid by non-Muslims living
under an Islamic Government. Since the non-Muslims are. exempt
from military service and taxes imposed on Muslims, they must pay
this tax to compensate. It guarantees them security and protection. If
the State cannot protect those who paid jizya, then the amount they
paid is returned to them.) As soon as he returned to Merv, Nizak
arrived in Tukharistan (now part of northern Afghanistan) and
revolted. Then Asbahand, the king of Balkh, Bazan the king of
Mardarood, the Prince of Talqan, Fayarab, the Prince of Jurjan and the
king of Kabul jointly hatched a conspiracy and expelled Qutaiba' s
Governor. Qutaiba sent his brother Abdur Rahman bin Muslim with
an army of twelve thousand with the instructions to encamp at
Yardqan. With the end of winter, Qutaiba sent some armies to Nishapur
(modern: Neyshabur, 50 kilometers west of Meshed) and led a multi
pronged attack against the rebels. As a result, they were punished in
proportion to their crime and all of them agreed to remain loyal and

180

The History of Islam

pay the Jizya. In this campaign, the fort of Samangan was captured
and annexed to the Islamic territory . Nizak was caught an9 killed.
The king of Jurjan was pardoned and allowed to remain king in his
own country. In brief, the Turkish chiefs rebelled repeatedly and they
were defeated each time by Qutaiba until the idea of rebellion left
their minds. In 92 A.H. Ratbeel, who has been mentioned in the
previous pages, intended to revolt but when Qutaiba arrived in his
territory with his army Ratbeel begged for forgiveness and paid the
Jizya. In 93 A.H., Qutaiba won the land of Khwarizm, took a promise
from its king to pay the legitimate taxes and then returned the country
to him. When Qutaiba was capturing Khwarizm, the natives of Safad
saw that the former was at a great distance from them expelled
Qutaiba' s governor and rebelled against him. Qutaiba sent the booty
from Khwarizm to Madinah, and he himself with an army rushed
towards Safad with terrific speed.
Having heard Qutaiba's arrival the inhabitants of Safad requested the
Chinese emperor to help them and he sent his veteran generals and
princ;es for their defense. The Turks prepared to defend the fort of
Samarkand. Qutaiba came and began to the fight. Several bloody
battles were fought. The son of the Chinese emperor was killed. The
fort was brought under Muslim control by virtue of their strength and
thousands of Turks were put to death. Heavy taxes were imposed on
them and the leaders of the revolt who were arrested were sent to
Hajjaj. Among the captives was a woman who was a descendent of
Yazdegerd (who was the child ruler of Persia at the time of its fall to
the Muslims). He sent the woman to Waleed bin Abdul Malik who
married her. She gave birth to his son Yazid . After coming back to
Merv, Qutaiba_,appointed Mughira bin Abdullah the Governor of
Nishapur. In 94 A.H., the inhabitants of Shash seem to be ready to
revolt, Qutaiba asked the rules of Bukhara Kush, Nasf and Khwarizm
for help. All responded and an army of ten thousand soldiers was
collected. Qutaiba encamped at Khajand and sent the army to Shash
led by the leaders of the above-mentioned forces. Shash was conquered
and Qutaiba returned to Merv while he was returning he was informed
of Hajjaj's death. At that time, the Muslims occupied all the territories
up to Kashgar and had established Islamic rule firmly over all of

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

181

Turkistan. He sent a delegation to the Chinese emperor under the
leadership of Habira bin Mashmarj Kilabi with the message. "Accept
Islamic rule or the horses of the Islamic warriors will run over China" .

Mohammad bin Qasim
During the time when the Muslims marched victoriously out of
Arabia, the Sindh was ruled over by a Buddhist king. When the
Iranian empire was shattered to pieces at the hands of the Muslims,
many Iranian chiefs fled to the Sindh, Turkistan and China and were
engaged in preparing for war against the Muslims. Some others
embraced Islam and began to lead happy lives in their countries. It
was by sheer chance that when the Sectional and family rivalries
between Banu Hashim and Banu Umayyah increased, the Iranians
were also reminded of their own age-old national rivalry and they
began to take part in the conspiracies hatched by Abdullah bin Saba
and other hypocrites. These conspiracies and the civil wars among the
Muslims breathed new life into the plans of those Iranians who were
in exile in Sindh, Kabul, China, and Tibet and among those who were
engaged in preparing to fight the Islamic forces. This is one of the
reasons that the Muslims had to face hardships repeatedly in Kufa,
Basra, Iran and Khorasan.
Because Sindh was nearer to Basra and Kufa and it touched the
ranian border, the refuge of choice for many of the subversive
Iranians was the Sindh. The king of Sindh seeing the flood of Islamic
ictories was very unhappy and employed all possible strategies to
elp the Iranians re-establish their ancient kingdom. The last king of
ran collected several armies and fought with the Muslims a number
f times after the battle of Nahavand (the decisive battle that marked
he conquest of Iran) . In all those battles, the army of Sindh always
llied themselves with the king of Iran. When the Iranian emperor
as killed, the king of Sindh annexed the bordering provinces of
ranian and the vanquished Iranians surrendered Kerman and
aluchistan to him willingly so that they might not be occupied by
he Muslims and they might continue to enjoy the privilege of the
upport of the king of Sindh.
11 these considerations made it imperative for the Muslims to launch

182

The History of Islam

an attack on the king of Sindh and to force him to cut off aid to the
Iranian subversives .. However, before the Musli!11s could occupy Iran
and Khorasan completely during the caliphate of Uthman bin Affan
(= 11 ,? J), the internal feuds in the heartlands of the Islamic territories
broke out and no attention was paid to the Sindh, or to any other
critical military site. Amir Muawiya,(= 11'-"" J) after freeing himself
from internal disruptions, turned his attention to the foreign lands and
it was during his regime that the first efforts were made to regain the
Iranian territory annexed by the king of Sindh. In that connection, a
few skirmishes took place with his army but then the internecine wars
re-started during Yazid's regime and consequently the Muslims did
not fulfill their military priorities abroad .
During Abdul Malik's regime, the Muslims again did not have an
opportunity to pay attention to foreign campaigns. Hajjaj who was the
governor of the eastern countries considered it more strategic to
contain Ratbeel the Governor of Afghanistan and Badakhshan than to
attack the Sindh simply because Ratbeel was the greater danger to the
Islamic province of Khorasan. Therefore, his attention remained
centered on Ratbeel. Hajjaj's Governor Qutaiba achieved continued
success in disciplining the rebels in the territories extending all the
way to China. Sindh was the only country where the Muslims still had
a security situation that was pending. However, before the Muslims could
take an initiative on this important work, the king of Sindh himself
challenged them virtually inviting an invasion of his country.
The following are the details of the king of Sindh's fateful error. It is
said that a few Muslims traders died in Sri Lanka in the course of their
business expedition. The Sri Lankan king decided to use the presence
of the orphans and the widows of these traders on the island to attract
the kindness and the attention of Hajjaj bin Yusuf and Caliph Waleed
bin Abdul Malik to himself. The Sri Lankan king had heard the
legendary news of Muslim victories. He was overawed by their
successes and had been· in search of an opportunity and a way to
express and pay his respect to the new and dominant nation in the
region. He therefore sent the orphans and the widows on his own ship
with an escort of some of his most trusted men to Hajjaj. Many
invaluable' gifts to Hajjaj and the Caliph Waleed also were sent

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

183

accompanying them with the hope that the orphans and the widows
would appreciate his good and kind gesture and applaud him before
Hajjaj. The boats left Lanka and sailed towards the Arabian Gulf along
the coast. They intended to land in the Gulf and travel to Kufa in
order to return the families of the traders and present the gifts to
Hajjaj. A storm over took them on the way and they were forced to
take shelter in the port of Debal. There the soldiers of Dahir, the king
Jo f Sindh, looted the boats and made the passengers their captives.
When Hajjaj was informed, he wrote to the king that those boats were
,on the way to him and so he should punish the looters suitably and
send him the passengers along with all the goods that were
!confiscated. The King gave a very proud and impertinent reply. Hajjaj
immediately sent Abdullah Aslami along with six thousand soldiers to
:Sindh. Abdullah was killed while fighting the king of Sindh and the
je xpedition met with failure. Next, Hajjaj sent another commander
!named Budail. He also went there along with six thousand soldiers and
1he was martyred while fighting against the king.
!Hajjaj was distressed to hear this news. He then sent Mohammad bin
!Qasim his nephew and son-in-law, a youth only 17 years old, along
!with six thousand Syrian troops. This time he chose Syrian troops to
!accompany Mohammed bin Qasim because 1-Iajjaj suspected that the
[Iraqi and the Iranian soldiers were in league with the Sindhis.
!Mohammed bin Qasim first captured the province of Makran (coastal
area that is part of modern Iran and Pakistan), which was under the
occupation of the Sindhis. Then he came to Debal and conquered it
and next moved towards Niroon and Brahminabad. Not only Iranian
subversives but also many Arabs who had rebelled against the caliph
had fled and taken refuge with King Dahir in Sindh. This was another
reason why the invasion of the Sindh was inevitable. King Dahir
fought against the Muslim forces but was killed. Then Mohammed bin
Qasim started conquering the cities of Sindh one after another until all
of Sindh and Multan came under his occupation.
During the conquest of Sindh, Hajjaj kept his attention concentrated
on Mohammed bin Qasim. He ~ent for news and gave instructions
daily. Mohammed bin Qasim proved himself to be an extremely
benevolent and merciful victor who was concerned about the general

i

1,

184

The History of Islam

welfare of the people. The equality, humility and generosity that this
young victor displayed are rarely found anywhere in the annals of
world history. He had completed the conquest of Multan when he
received the news of Hajjaj's death but he continued his series of
conquests and by 96 A.H., he had brought all of Western India from
Surat to Kashmir under his control.

Hajjaj bin Yusuf Thaqfi
Hajjaj has.continually been mentioned throughout the previous pages.
Immediately after Waleed bin Abdul Malik's succession to the throne,
Hajjaj removed Yazid bin Muhallab and Habib bin Muhallab from the
Governorship of Khorasan and Kerman respectively and put them
into prison he also imprisoned their sons too. Yazid along with his
brothers fled from the jail and went to Waleed bin Abdul Malik's
brother Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik in Palestine where he was the
administrator. Hajjaj wrote a letter to Waleed complaining against
Yazid bin Muhallab but on the recommendation of Sulaiman, Waleed
did not punish Yazid bin Muhallab o-i: his brothers. Hajjaj's hard
temperament had harassed the Iraqis to the extent that many of them,
after getting tired of him, fled from Iraq and settled in Makkah and
Madinah where Umar bin Abdul Aziz was the Governor. He treated
them kindly. In. 93 A.H., Umar bin Abdul Aziz wrote a letter to Waleed
complaining about Hajjaj and that he had put Iraq through a long period
of persecution. He also complained that Hajjaj had also crossed the
limits by perpetrating atrocities against the people of Iraq. When Hajjaj
came to know of these complaints he sent a letter to Waleed making a
counter complaint against Umar bin Abdul Aziz saying that most of the
trouble makers and hypocrites wanted in Iraq go to Umar bin Abdul
Aziz and he creates hurdles in their arrest. This will prove very harmful
for running of our administration. It is only proper that you should
remove him from the Governorship of the Hijaz." Waleed removed
Umar bin Abdul Aziz from the Governorship of Hijaz and appointed
Khalid bin Abdullah and Uthman bin Hebban as the governors of
Makkah and Madinah. Immediately after assuming power, Khalid
turned all the Iraqis out of Makkah and also threatened those who had
rented out their houses to them. Sayeed bin Jubair was one of those who
migrated to Makkah in order to escape from Hajjaj's atrocities. Sayeed

,

,!'

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

185

bin Jubair's only fault was that he had supported Abdul Rahman bin
Ash' ath. It was not an ordinary fault in Hajjaj' s eyes. Khalid arrested
him and sent him to Hajjaj who killed him.
Sayeed bin Jubair was killed for no fault of his and his was not the
only case of its kind but Hajjaj put many saintly and pious people to
death mercilessly.
Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik was expecting to become caliph after Waleed
bin Abdul Malik because Abdul Malik made Sulaiman his heir-apparent
after Waleed and took the oath from the people for it. Waleed wanted to
make his own son Abdul Aziz the heir-apparent and deprive his brother
Sulaiman. He had spoken about it to his deputies separately. Hajjaj and
Qutaiba appreciated the idea but the others warned him saying, "There
is a great danger of this action causing fitnah (Arabic: evil disorder)
among the Muslims." That same year in 95 A.H. in the month of
Shawwal and after ruling in Iraq for twenty years Hajjaj died. At the
time of his death, he appointed his son Abdullah bin Hajjaj the
Governor of Iraq. Waleed bin Abdul Malik retained all the Governors
that had been appointed by Hajjaj in their respective posts.

Musa bin Nusayr
Just as Hajjaj was the Governor of the eastern territories, similarly the
Governor of the western territories during Waleed bin Abdul Malik's
regime was Musa bin Nusayr whose headquarters was Qairwan. A
few persons from Spain called on the strongest and ' most
distinguished man of North Africa and complained to him against
their King Roderick's atrocities and requested him to invade Spain
and like Morocco annex it to his territory.
Musa thought over their request for a few days. Then he sent a slave
of his with four boats and 400 soldiers on board to the Spanish coast to
get a first hand understanding of the situation. At the same time, he
requested permission from the caliph Waleed to invade Spain. The
caliph granted it and the 400 soldiers returned safely.
In 92 A.H., Musa gave 7000 soldiers to his liberated slave, Tariq bin
Zeyad to invade Spain. At that time, Tariq was the Governor of
Tangier in Morocco. He along with his men boarded their boats and

186

The History of Islam

after crossing the straits of Gibraltar landed on the coast of Spain and
moved north. The Spanish king Roderick along with a one hundred
thousand man army array~d themselves to fight with him. The two
forces clashed on the bank of a small river near Janda Lagoon adjoining
Sidonia_city in Ramadan 92 A.H. Ouly 711 C.E.). The fight continued
ferociously for eight days. At last, on the eighth day, 28 Ramadan 92
A.H., Roderick was killed by Tariq and the Christian army fled away.
That same year the king of Sindh, Dahir, was killed by Mohammad bin
Qasim. After his initial victory, Tariq found it far easier to conquer the
cities of Spain and marched ahead conquering city after city. When
Musa bin Nusayr was informed of the major victory they had achieved,
he wrote to Tariq to stop any further advance and await his arrival.
However, it was very difficult for Tariq and his valiant soldiers to put a
stop to their conquests. Finally, Musa along with 18,000 soldiers reached
Spain in the latter part of Ramadan 93 A.H. and conquered the entire
peninsula up to the Pyrenees Mountains. After taking control of the
eastern part of Spain Musa wrote to Waleed, "We have conquered the
whole of Spain. Now allow me to go to Constantinople via Europe while
conquering the European lands from Spain to Constantinople and I will
visit you after the conquest of Constantinople"
However, Waleed bin Abdul Malik wrote to Musa to come to him
along with Tariq via Africa after making some one Governor in Spain.
Had Musa been permitted to go ahead it was not difficult at that time
for him conquer the whole of Southern Europe.
Anyway, Musa, in compliance with the Caliph' s order, deputed his
son Abdul Aziz as the Governor in Spain, entrusted Morocco to his
second son Abdul Malik and made his third son Abdullah his deputy
in Qairwan, which was the headquarters of North Africa. After
making the proper arrangements, he left for Damascus. On the day he
arrived in Damascus, the caliph Waleed died.

Death of Waleed bin Abdul Malik
Waleed wanted to prevent his brother from succeeding to the throne
and tried to replace him by his own son but in vain. Had he lived a
few days more he would have probably succeeded. Due to these
efforts by .Waleed to take the caliphate from his brother, Sulaiman i

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

187

became hostile to the leaders who had supported Waleed and also to
those whom Waleed loved. The results of this hostility proved
extremely disastrous for the future of the Islamic world. Waleed after
ruling as Caliph for nine years and eight months died at Dairmaran in
Syria on 25 Jamad ath-Thani 96 A.H. (25 February 815 CE) leaving
behind nineteen sons. During his caliphate, Sindh, Turkistan, Bukhara,
Samarkand, most of the cities and forts of Spain and Asia Minor and
several islands were annexed to the Islamic territory. His caliphate
marked an epoch of internal peace, comfort and prosperity for the
Muslims with a vast expansion of territory. With the exception of Umar
bin Khatab's caliphate, none of the previous caliphates experienced such
a great age of major and significant conquests. When Waleed died, his
brother Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik was at Ramla, in Palestine.

Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik
Sulaiman was younger than his brother Waleed by four years. The
oath for caliph was done at his hand on Jamad ath-Thani 96 A.H. after
Waleed's death. Hajjaj and Qutaiba were unanimous with Waleed in
deposing Sulaiman and as Qutaiba bin Muslim supported Hajjaj and
Waleed, they were the targets of his hatred. Hajjaj had died before
Sulaiman came into power and Qutaiba the Governor of Khorasan
was the staunchest supporter of Waleed that remained alive. Qutaiba
had a feeling how he would be treated during this caliphate.

The Murder of Qutaiba
When Qutaiba bin Muslim Bahli heard of Waleed's demise and
Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik's succession to the throne, he assembled all
the leaders and army of Khorasan and suggested that they should
refuse to recognize Sulaiman's caliphate. A sizable number of soldiers
in Qutaiba's army consisted mainly of the tribe of Banu Tamim. The
leader of the Banu Tamim was named Waki. When Waki understood
the situation, he began to take the oath on behalf of Sulaiman.
Gradually the news spread among all the soldiers and all tribes rallied
round Waki. Qutaiba tried his level best to make them listen to him but in
vain. They actually started becoming rude to him openly. Qutaiba was
joined and supported by his brother's sons and relatives, finally the

188

The History of Islam

soldiers started looting and burning his things. His relatives wanted to
protect his tents but they all were killed and Qutaiba falling wounded
and unconscious to the ground had his head cut off at once. Eleven men
including his brothers and sons were killed. From among his brothers
Umar bin Muslim survived because his mother came from Banu Tamim.
Waki sent Qutaiba's head and ring to Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik.
Qutaiba bin Muslim was a great conqueror and a popular chief from
Banu Umayyah. Such a death of such a chief was very sad indeed. He
acted imprudently in opposing the caliph of the time, Sulaiman bin
Abdul Malik can not be accused of Qutaiba' s murder.

Death of Mohammed bin Qasim
The greatest charge that can be leveled against Sulaiman bin Abdul
Malik in respect to Mohammed bin Qasim is that if the caliph hated
Hajjaj, he should not have extended it unnecessarily to include his
relatives. It is unfortunate that Sulaiman considered Mohammed bin
Qasim worthy of execution. Mohammed bin Qasim was a wise, brave
gentle and pious youth. As a young man, he excelled Rustam and
Alexander in the size of his conquests of Sindh and India and proved
himself ,5,uperior to Nausherwan the Just in matters of imparting
justice arid loving the people. He had never done anything against
Sulaiman, except be the relative of the hated Hajjaj.
Even after Hajjaj's death, he continued to conquer new territory. His
army was fond of hip. and obeyed him completely and this is the
greatest proof of the fact that he was a highly capable general. It is
possible that if Muhammad bin Qasim, whose beginning as a youth
was so magnifice1Jt, had been trained and his services utilized, he
could have conquered the whole of the Asian continent up to China
and Japan for Sulaiman. Overwhelmed with a deep seeded hatred of
all those connected to Hajjaj and Waleed, Sulaiman sent Yazid bin
Abu Kabsha as the Governor of Sindh with instructions to send
Mohammed bin Qasim back as a captive. Sulaiman's order was a
great discouragement and it destroyed the spirit of all the efficient and
victorious commanders. No shame for a caliph or a king is greater
than the fact that he, instead of honoring and rewarding his
commanders for their grand and praiseworthy achievements and feats
should catch and throw them into jail.

190

The History of Islam

Yazid bin Muhallab escaped from jail and joined Sulaiman bin Abdul
Malik in Palestine, who was at that time the Governor there. It has
also been recorded that at the time of his death, Hajjaj had made his
son Abdullah bin Hajjaj the Governor of Iraq in his place and Waleed
bin Abdul Malik authorized it. Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik dismissed
Hajjaj's son Abdullah as one of his first orders of business and
appointed Yazid bi(\ Muhallab. Yazid knew that if he put too much
pressure on the people in collecting taxes, he would lose his
reputation and if he adopted measures that were too lenient, he would
lose respect in Sulaiman's eyes. He persuaded Sulaiman to appoint
Saleh bin Abdur Rahman for the collection of taxes and the rest of the
administrative and military affairs would be his responsibility as the
Governor of Iraq.
Sulairrian did not think Yazid's request was strange because he
knew that Hajjaj had accused Yazid of embezzlement of
Government funds and had put him into prison. Therefore, Saleh
bin Abdur Rahman was recruited as the finance officer and was sent
to Iraq ahead of Yazid bin Muhallab who followed as Governor.
When Yazid reached Kufa, he fell out with Saleh and his presence
became a point of contention for Yazid.
During this period, news came that Qutaiba bin Muslim had been
killed in Khorasan. Yazid preferred the Governorship of Khorasan
because he and his father had once been Governors there. Sulaiman
in accordance with Yazid's wishes gave him the certificate of
Governorship for Khorasan and also left Iraq under him. Yazid
recruited his deputies in Kufa, Basra and Wasit separately. He
himself set out for Khorasan. Immediately after arriving there, he
invaded Qahistan and then Jurjan and entered into compromise
with the rebel chiefs there after collecting fines and taxes from them.
The Jurjanis revolted again and Yazid attacked and killed 40,000
Turks in the battle, he laid the foundation stone of the city of Jurjan
with his own hands and appointed Jahm bin Dhukhr Ju'fi as the
Governor. Prior to that, Jurjan did not have a city it was a hilly
region with many small villages. Yazid populated this city, which
came to be known as Jurjan. H e then captured Tabristan and
installed a Governor there.

Maslama bin Abdul Malik
In 97 A.H., Maslama bin Abdul Malik conquered Razakhia. In 98
A.H., a Roman commander named Alqaun came to Sulaiman's court
and induced him to conquer Constantinople. He sent his son Dawood
and brother Maslama to Constantinople with an army and Maslama
as the commander. He laid a siege to the city. When the Islamic army
reached the vicinity of the siege, Maslama asked each of his soldiers to
take a handful of grain and deposit it near the army's headquarters.
When the grain was collected near the end of the siege, it was piled so
high it looked like some hills. He had houses of clay and stone built
for the soldiers and ordered them to cultivate the land and the fields
ripened. To meet the daily consumption of food they also raided the
area for grain. Th~,, inhabitants of the city were concerned to see the
siege continuing with such a firm determination and courage. When a
year had passed, the Romans sent secr~t messages to Alqaun the
Roman commander and offered him half of the territory if he could
get the Muslims to raise the siege. He agreed. Then he advised
Maslama, "If you set your store of grains and fields on fire, the
Romans will think that now the Muslims are going to launch a final.
and decisive attack. Out of fear they will probably hand over the city
to you and thus without loss of life it will be easily captured."
Maslama believed his words and fell into his trap. Though the
Romans had already sent word to Maslama to take the Jizya at the rate
of one tenth per head and raise the siege he had rejected it. If the siege
had continued, there is little doubt that it would have resulted in a
victorious conquest. However, Allah
had not ordained for the
Muslims to capture and occupy Constantinople at this time. Maslama
burned the stored grain and all the grain fields. The Romans were
extremely pleased to see this foolish act and it encouraged them to
fight. The Muslims soon felt the crisis of c\ food shortage. Then Alqaun
with all his supporters deserted the Islamic forces and joined the
Romans. When Maslama had left Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik he was
camping at Dabiq and from there he used to send help of all kinds to
him. At this juncture, the stored grains and ripened fields had been
reduced to ashes and Sulaiman was not able to manage the supply of
provisions due to the advent of winter and this led to starvation. _They

192

The History of Islam

began to starve to death because food could not be procured by raiding
parties in the adjoining areas because of the severity of the winter.
When a Roman commander, named Borjohn, who was the Governor
of the city of Saqalia, saw the critical condition of the Muslims he
invaded them with a huge army. Maslama fought and defeated him
and captured the city. At this time, news came of Sulaiman bin Abdul
Malik' s death.

Morals and Habits of Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik
Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik was a man of eloquence. He was fond of
justice and liked jihad. He had made Umar bin Abdul Aziz his advisor
and minister. This is the main reason that Sulaiman cultivated good
habits. During the period of Banu Umayyah a bad custom came into
vogue, they offered their salat (obligatory prayer) in the last part of the
time for the prayer. Sulaiman put an end to that harmful custom and
began to do it at the beginning of the time for each prayer, which is
the correct method. He hated singing and the playing of musical
instruments and had it banned . He was very handsome. He was a
healthy and voracious eater. Once he ate 70 pomegranates, a large
amount of raisins a six month old goat and half a dozen chickens and
was able to digest it all.

Succession
Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik had made his son, Ayyub, his heirapparent but when Ayyub fell ill at Abaq, he consulted Raja bin
Haiwa regarding his successor. First Sulaiman mentioned his, son
Dawood. Raja bin Haiwa said, "He is engaged in th~ siege of
Constantinople and is at war with the unbelievers. No news has come
from there for a long period. Allah knows better whether he is living
or dead. Moreover, the distance is also long. I can not advise you to
declare such a man the heir apparent." Then Sulaiman referred to his
younger son. Raja bin Haiwa said that he was still of a tender age and
unfit to stand the burden of the caliphate. Then Sulaiman asked him
as to whom he shciuld make his successor. Raja bin Haiwa said "As a
pious, pure, noble man interi=sted in the welfare of the Muslims, it is
expected of you that you should make your cousin, Umar bin Abdul i

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

193

Aziz (.\,1..__.,J), your heir-apparent for none better than he is available.
Also as your Prime Minister he has the most experience in the matter
of ad...-n.inistration" . Sulaiman agreed to this saying, "I also regard him
as the best man. I am afraid that my brothers, the other sons of Abdul
Malik may not agree and stand against him". Raja bin Haiwa said
"After making Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.\,1 v-J the caliph, leave a will
that Yazid bin Abdul Malik will succeed him". Sulaiman appreciated
and accepted the idea and after writing the declaration of caliphate for
Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.\,1 .__.,..)) he sealed it. Then he put it into an
envelope and sealed it too and giving it to Raja bin Haiwa he said,
"Go out and showing this envelope, tell the pe9ple that the Amir alMuminin has chosen the man who will be the next caliph and has also
written a declaration that the oath should be taken in the name of the
man whose name this envelope contains." When Raja bin Haiwa went
out and read it to the people, they said that they would not take the
oath until they knew his name. Raja bin Haiwa retun:ed and
explained t? Sulaiman, he said that the city magistrate and the police
should be called to take the oath from the people and cut off the heads
of those who disobeyed. Hearing that all took the oath without any
further hesitation.
When Raja bin Haiwa was returning to the palace after taking the
oath, he came across Hisham bin Abdul Malik. He said to him "I am
afraid Amir al-Muminin might have deprived me. If my fears are
correct, please tell me -so that I may make arrangemeots for myself".
Raja bin Haiwa said, "The Amir Al-Muminin has given me a sealed
envelope. He has kept it a g~arded secret. What can I tell you?" As he
continued on, he met Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.\,1v-J), He said, "I am
very afraid that Sulaiman might have written my name. If you know,
please tell me so that I may try to evade this trouble and rid myself of
this burden". Raja gave him the same reply, which had already given
to Hisham bin Abdul Malik.

Death of Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik
In 98 A.H., Sulaiman left Damascus with an intention of making jihad,
he sent an army towards the front. He stayed at Dabiq and continued
working on the success of the expedition. Therefore, it may be said

194

The History of Islam

that he died in that state of jihad itself. He died on Friday the 10 th of
Safar 99 A. H. at Dabiq adjacent to Qansareen (one of the five original
provinces that the conquering Arabs divided greater Syria into, now
northern Syria). He was 45 years old. He ruled for two and three
quarter years. During his caliphate, the Muslims gained victories and
occupied many lands. Activities against the Islamic laws were stopped.
Hajjaj's Governors were dismissed wherever they were found because
they were inclined to be like Hajjaj and perpetrated atrocities on the
people. However, it is understood that the treatment that was meted
out to Mohammed bin Qasim (.1>1..-J was a gross mistake committed
by Sulaiman. Among his most praiseworthy and greatest feats is the
fact that he made Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.1>1 ·-··) his successor.
Compared to this virtuous act, all of Sulaiman' s errors and mistakes
may easily be pardoned and so it appears that he deserves praise.

Umar bin Abdul Aziz (k, 4.2-J)
Abu Hafs, Umar bin Abdul Aziz bin Marwan bin Hakam is
considered the fifth caliph among the Khulafa ar-Rashideen (The rightly
guided caliphs) . He is also known as Khalifa as-Saleh (the capable or
authentic caliph). Most of the scholars among the Muslims say that the
Khulafa ar-Rashideen are five: Abu Bakr (= .1>11,S'""J), Umar (= .1>1 <.,>";),
Uthman (~ .1>1 ~J), Ali(= .1>1 \,S'""J) and Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.1>1. . ,-).
Umar bin Abdul Aziz's father Abdul Aziz bin Marwan was the
Governor of Egypt. Umar bin Abdul Aziz was born in 62 A.H. His
mother was Umar bin Khatab's grand daughter that is, Asim bin
Umar bin Khatab's daughter. His father was supposed to succeed
Abdul Malik bin Marwan as caliph but he died in Abdul Malik's
lifetime and so he did not become the caliph. Umar bin Abdul Aziz
had a ' scar on his face because a horse had kicked him while he was a
child. Umar bin Khatab (~ 11 ~J) used to say" There will come a
descendent of mine with a scar on his face. He will fill the earth with
justice and righteousness." That was why when the horse kicked him
and he began to bleed, his father continued to mop his face and say,
"If you are the one spoken about with the scar, you are fortunate." lbn
Sad says that Umar bin Khatab used to say " I wish that I might have
found the times of my scarred son who would fill theworld with

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

195

justice and righteousness after being full of tyranny". There was a scar
on the face of another grandson, Bela! bin Abdullah bin Umar, so it
was thought that it might apply to him. However, when Umar bin
Abdul Aziz ( :.1 ,.,-J became caliph, everyone came to know that Umar
bin Khatab meant him. Prior to it, some people used to say that the
world will not come to an end so long as Umar's ideal caliph had not
become the ruler.
Umar bin Abdul Aziz's father sent him to Madinah when he was a
child. He was trained there. His life was spent in the company of the
learned legal scholars of Madinah. It was from them that he learned
theology. He enjoyed such a high status in knowledge and virtue that
had he not been the caliph he would have been counted among the
religious scholars and been recognized as a great imam. His father
had sent him to Obaidullah bin Abdullah in Madinah and it was
under his tutelage that he was trained. Zaid bin Aslam has narrated
on the authority of Anas ("--"' .1,1 ~J) "After the Prophet(~ ) we have
never performed our Salat (obligatory prayers) in a way that
resembled the Prophet's Salat except the Salat we made behind Umar
bin Abdul Aziz (11 v·J. Zaid says, "He used to do ruku (bowing) and
sijda (prostration) fully but did not make delay in qiyam (standing) and
qaood (sitting). Someone asked Muhammad bin Ali bin Husain about
Umar bin Abdul Aziz. He said "He is najib (highborn) among Banu
Umayyah and will rise as a single nation on the Day of Judgment" .
Before becoming caliph Umar bin Abdul Aziz wore showy and costly
clothes. However, after becoming caliph he adopted the life style of a
poor in his food and clothing. Maimoon bin Mehran says that many
well known scholars used to live in his company as students. Mujahid
says "We went to Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11....~)) with the intention that
he would learn something from us but after corning to him we had
much to learn from him".
When his father Abdul Aziz bin Marwan died, he was present in
Madinah. At the news of his death, Abdul Malik bin Marwan called
him to Damascus and married his daughter Fatima to him. When
Waleed became caliph after Abdul Malik's death, he placed him as the
Governor of Madinah. He therefore remained in power from 86 A.H.
to 93 A.H. He performed Hajj several times as Amir al-Hajj (leader of

196

The History of Islam

the pilgrimage). During the period of his governorship of Madinah, all
the scholars and learned Muslims used to gather round him.
He had set up a council of legal scholars in Madinah and used to
dispose of the affairs of expeditions in consultation with them.
Because of Hajjaj's complaint, Waleed dismissed him from the
governorship of Madinah and called him to live in Syria. When Waleed
wanted to depose his brother Sulaiman from the succession and put
his own son in his place, Hajjaj and Qutaiba seconded his proposal but
other leaders disliked it. The first man who openly and vehemently
opposed Waleed was Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 .....). Because of this,
Waleed threw him into prison. He remained there for three years and
was released on some one's recommendation. Sulaiman bin Abdul
Malik was highly obliged to him for his sacrifice. That is why when
Sulaiman became Caliph, he selected him as his Prime Minister and
left in his will for him to be caliph after his death.

Caliphate
When Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik passed away, Raja bin Haiwa went
to the mosque at Dabiq. He gathered all of the Banu Umayyah and all
who were related to the army and who were then present. He had the
sealed decree of the heir apparent in his hands. He informed them of
the Caliph's death and took the oath on the sealed decree again. Then he
opened it and read it to them. Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik had written.
"From the slave of Allah, Amir Al-Muminin, Sulaiman bin Abdul
Malik, to Umar bin Abdul Aziz. I hereby nominate you after me and
then Yazid bin Abdul Malik after you, to be the heir apparent. The
people should listen and obey and fear Allah and avoid creating
dissension among themselves so that others may not feel tempted to
overpower you.
Having heard the royal letter, Hisham bin Abdul Malik said that he
would not take the oath with Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 •.•·-J. However,
Raja bin Haiwa courageously and sternly answered, "I shall cut off
your head" . Hisham became silent when he heard this. Abdul Malik's
descendents took the will and decree as a deprivation of their
privileges but the people in general liked Umar bin Abdul Aziz as

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

197

Caliph and did not want anybody else. Because Yazid bin Abdul
Malik was made the heir apparent after Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 .....-J
his descendents were somewhat satisfied that after Umar bin Abdul
Aziz' s (11 -.,,..J the caliphate would come into their family again. When
Raja read Sulaiman's will, Umar bin Abdul Aziz was uttering <.l! c! J 1 c!
; ; ~ 1J , To Allah do we belong and to Him is our return, (Editors note:
In Islam, this statement is advised to be read when a calamity befalls
someone). When he heard his name he kept sitting and was virtually
rooted to his place. Raja grabbed him by his hand and lifted him up
and made him sit on the pulpit. He first called Hisham bin Abdul
Malik to come and take the oath. He obeyed. Then others foll~;wed
suit with pleasure and no one raised any objection or protest. After the
taking of the oath was completed, Umar bin Abdul Aziz led the
funeral prayer for Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik. When the burial
services were finished, they brought a horse from the royal stable for
him. He said that his personal mule was sufficient for him. So, he rode
on his mule to go to his tent. They wanted to take him to the royal
palace. He said "Ayyub bin Sulaiman' s family members are there. As
long as they are there, I shall live in my tent" After the oath of
caliphate, he made a speech:
"He praised Allah and said, 0 people! There is no Book after the
Qur'an and there is no Prophet after Mohammed(~ )- I am not going
to initiate anything new but I am supposed to complete (what has
been left incomplete). I am not a mubtadi (initiator) but a muttabi
(follower) and I am by no means better than you. Yes, my load is
heavier. One who runs away from a tyrannical king, can not be a
tyrant himself, remember obedience to any creature against the divine
commandments is not lawful.
When he was returning from the funeral of Sulaiman bin Abdul
Malik, his slave said to him "You look sad" . He said, "If any body has
a right to be grieved today, it is me. Is it a light burden? Before I am
asked to explain the written register of my actions, I will have to give
the people their dues". When he finished the oath for caliphate and
the funeral service and entered his house~ his beard was wet with
tears. His ~ife, becoming alarmed, asked him whether he was well.
He said, " How can I be well? The burden of the entire Ummah

i

i
i

:I

198

The History of Islam

(community) has been put around my neck. 1 have been
overburdened with the naked, the hungry, the sick, the oppressed, the
travelers, the captives, the children, the old, and the poor with large
families. I am weeping for the fear of being asked to render accounts
and my possible failure to do so on the Day of Reckoning".
After becoming caliph, he said to his wife, Fatima bint Abdul Malik
"Deposit all your jewelry in the bait al mal (treasury) or I shall part
with you because I don't like that you, your jewelry and I should live
under the same roof". His wife sent all her jewelry including an
invaluable pearl, which Abdul Malik had given to his daughter, to the
treasury.
When Yazid bin Abdul Malik succeeded to the caliphate following
Umar bin Abdul Aziz's death, he asked Fatima bint Abdul Malik to
take back her jewelry if she willed . She replied that she had deposited
her jewelry in the bait al mal (treasury) willingly and that it was
impossible for her to take them back after Umar bin Abdul Aziz.
Abdul Aziz bin Waleed was not present at the time of Sulaiman's
death nor did he know anything about the oath for the caliphate of
Umar bin Abdul Aziz. Upon hearing of Sulaiman's death, he decided
to claim the caliphate and took an army and he went to Damascus.
When he reached there and was told about Umar bin Abdul Aziz's
caliphate, he came to him without any inhibition and took the oath
and said that he did not know that people had taken the oath at his
hand. Umar bin Abdul Aziz said "Had you been interested in taking
the governance and caliphate, I would never have stood in your way
or fought against you rather I would have evaded it and sat at home."
Abdul Aziz bin Waleed said, "By Allah, I don't think anybody else
other than you deserves it."
Immediately after becoming caliph Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.'i,1._,..; )
issued instructions that from that time nobody should talk badly of
Ali (~ .'i,1 ~J)- Until that time Banu Umayyah had been abusing Ali
("----"' .'i,1 i..,--"J) and in the Friday khutba (sermon) they never hesitated in
cursing and reproaching him.
He took Hajjaj bin Yusuf Thaqfi to be a tyrant. Therefore, during
Sulaiman's regime he had dismissed all the governors and associates

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

199

who toed Hajjaj's line. He regarded Yazid bin Muhallab, the Governor
of Khorasan, as a bad person. He knew that he did not send the taxes
to the treasury after their collection. He therefore sent for him. When
he came, he invented excuses in respect of the taxes. He said to him
"This is the wealth of the Muslims. How can I excuse it?" . He
therefore dismissed him and put him into prison in the fort of Halab
and sent Jarrah bin Abdullah Hakmi as the Governor of Khorasan in
his place. He recalled Maslama bin Abdul Malik and his soldiers who
had been continuously busy fighting the Romans and besieging
Constantinople. They were exhausted and shattered. After short time,
he received a complaint against Jarrah bin Abdullah that he was
sending liberated slaves on jihad without salary and collecting khiraj
(taxes on revenue from land or the work of slaves) even from the
dhimmis (non Muslims who have paid the jizya and have the right to
protection and are not expected to pay another type of tax) . Upon
hearing the complaint he sent him the order: "Excuse the jizya of those
who make Sa/at" (Editors note: The jizya is applied to non Muslims
but apparently the governor was not convinced of the sincerity of the
new Muslims' Islam and therefore continued to collect the jizya,
which is the protection tax on non Muslims that excludes other taxes
and releases those who pay it from military duty. The caliph was
telling the governor that the discerning point is the prayer, in other
words if someone was praying like a Muslim he should be considered
a Muslim and free from paying the jizya).
As soon the people heard this order, they began to embrace Islam in
group after group, Jarrah bin Abdullah Aslami was not satisfied with
the new converts sincerity. He tested them on the basis of circumcision
[Editors note: The governor instead of seeing if the new Muslims
made their obligatory prayer checked to see if they were circumcised.
Cireumcision is a very strongly recommended in Islam but is not
considered absolutely necessary.] When Umar bin Abdul Aziz
received this news, he wrote to Jarrah, "Allah sent Mohammad (~ ) as
a da'yi (one who invites the people to Allah) not as a Khatin (one who
circumcises)". He then had him recalled to Damascus. Jarrah left
Abdur Rahman bin Nairr{ as his deputy and presented himself at the
court of the Caliph. Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 ,.,-J said, "When did you
leave Khorasan?" He said, "In the month of Ramadan" He said: "He ·

200

The History of Islam

who calls you an oppressor is right. Why did you not stay there and
wait until the end of the month of Ramadan?"
Then he appointed Abdur Rahman bin Nairn as the Amir of defense
and Salat and Abdur Rahman Qushairi as the collector of taxes.
Attacks were launched against the Muslims in Azerbaijan and
they were plundered . Umar bin Abdul Aziz gave an army to lbn
Hatim Bahli and sent him ther:e. He went and punished them
suitably and restored respect for Islamic rule. It was during his
regime that the Sindhis and their kings embraced Islam willingly
and Islam was propagated there extensively. He sent an army
with provisions and weapons to Spain. He had some victories
against the Romans also.

Causes of Banu Umayyah's Displeasure
During their caliphate and rule, Banu Umayyah had taken possession
of the best of selected lands and villages beyond what they deserved.
This led to the deprivation of other Muslims but as they were the
rulers, no one dared raise a voice in protest. When Umar bin Abdul
Aziz became caliph, he first had the jewelry of his wife, considered
undeserved by him, taken out of his house and sent to the treasury.
Then he gathered Banu Umayyah and said:
The Prophet (~) owned the orchard of Fadak with its income he (~ )
used to maintain the children of Banu Hashim and helped arrange
marriages for their widows. Fatima hint Muhammad (4------"- 11<? 1 )
wanted the orchard for herself but he (~) refused to give it to her.
During Abu Bakr Siddiq's and Umar bin Khatab's regime, it remained
untouched. Finally, Mc1rwan took it into his possession and from him 1
inherited it. However, I fail to understand how a thing, which the
Prophet (~) refused to give to his daughter became lawful for me. I,
therefore, want you to stand witness that I leave the orchard of Fadak
intact as it was during the Prophet's times."
Then he made all his relatives and then Banu Umayyah return their
properties, goods and wealth, which were under their possession
illegally. Auzai relates that one day when most of the nobles and
leaders of Banu Umayyah were sitting at his house, he said to them,

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

201

'You want me to make you the commanders of armies or the
overnors of some territories. Remember, I don't want the floor of
y house made impure with your feet. Your condition is highly
pitiable. I can not make you the masters of my piety and the
business of the Muslims." They said "Do we not deserve any right
or virtue due to your kinship?" He said, "In this matter I don't find
even an iota of difference between you and any other Muslim ."
After the Klzilafat ar-Rashideh (the rightly guided Caliphate) the glory
of democracy had disappeared and the same type of autocracy in
government was discernable that was the hallmark of the
governments of Caesar and Kisra. Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.iii v-J)
tried to restore the lost glory of Islamic democracy and similarities
to the administrations of Abu Baker Siddiq(= .&1_,.;,J) and Umar bin
Kha tab (= 11 _,.;, )) began to resurface and remind the people of these
great times.
As Banu Umayyah· suffered heavy losses during his caliphate and
the assets they occupied illegally were taken back and the high
status, pomp and grandeur they enjoyed during their rule in
comparison with other tribes, started changing into equality and
impartiality, all of them began to consider Umar bin Abdul Aziz's
caliphate to be highly detrimental to their interests. They were
compelled to accept and appreciate his piety and purity of nature
just as others were but Banu Umayyah regarded his presence as a
deadly poison for their clain and tribe.
Once Banu Umayyah, in order to save their property, made a plan.
They went to Umar bin Abdul Aziz's paternal aunt Fatima bint
Marwan and requested her to recommend them to him. He respected
her very much. She came and made her recommendation for Banu
Umayyah. He explained to her in the same way he had told the
leaders of Banu Umayyah. She felt compelled to admit "I did come to
you to convince you on the insistence of your brethren. However,
since you cherish such pure and noble thoughts, I don't like to say
anything more." Having said that she went back and said to Banu
Umayyah "You established relations with the grand daughter of
Umar bin Khatab ('---"' 11 ._,--;,)) and now his blood is present in your
descendents".

Virtues and Habits
Hakam bin Umar says that one day he was with Umar bin Abdul Aziz
(...'i i vJ and the stable-keeper came and demanded the expenses for the
stable. He said to him. "Take all these horses to the cities in Syria and
sell them at any price and give the money in the path of Allah . For me
my mule is enough."
Zuhri says that Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.i.1 ,_.,-J asked Salim bin
Abdullah through a letter as to Umar bin Khatab's (-= .i.1 .,?;) way
regarding Sadaqa (charity). He replied adding at the end "If you follow
Umar bin Khatab (-= .&1 .,?.,) in treating people, you will get a greater
status than he before Allah." When Umar bin Abdul Aziz was made
caliph and the people took the oath at his hands, he began to weep
and said "I have a great fear for myself" . Hammad said, "Please
declare how much love you have for dirhams and dinars?" Umar bin
Abdul Aziz (...'iii.___.-;) said, "Not a bit". Hammad said," Then why are
you worried? Allah will help you."
Hanifa bin Sayeed bin Aas said to Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.i.1 ..-;)."All
the caliphs before you used to give us rewards. However you, after
becoming caliph, put a stop to that, I have some land and if you
permit, I would like to take something from it in order to maintain my
family somehow." He said, "Whatever you get from hard labor, is
yours". Then he further said, "Remember death often for if you are in
trouble, you will get pleasure and if you are in pleasure, you will not
find it lessened." Some Governor wrote to him that the forts and roads
of their cities were in urgent need of repair and so would he kindly
send them money for their repair. He wrote back that immediately
after going through the letter they should set out to build forts of
justice in their cities and purify the roads by removing oppression
from them.
Ibrahim Sakuni (-= .&1 .,?;) says that Umar bin Abdul Aziz used to say,
"When I came to know that lying is a vice, I have never done so since
then" Wahb bin Munabbih says that if there is a Mahdi to be born in
this ummat (community), he is Umar bin Abdul Aziz.
Mohammad bin Fadala relates that Abdullah bin Umar bin Abdul

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

203

Aziz passed by an ascetic who lived on an island. The ascetic saw him
and went to him though he had never gone to anyone before and
began to say to him, "Do you know why I have come to you?" He
replied in the negative. Then he said "Simply because you are the son
of a righteous and just imam (leader) ."
Malik bin Dinar ('-"' .1,1 ~J) relates that when Umar bin Abdul Aziz
became caliph, the shepherds began to ask. "Who has become the
caliph? Now the wolves do not harm our goats" Musa bin Ayum says,
"We used to graze our goats in Kerman. The wolves used to move
along with our goats but they did not harm them. One day it so
happened that a wolf took away a goat. I cried out, "The righteous
caliph must have died today" . When information on the matter was
sought after, it transpired that on that same day Umar bin Abdul Aziz
(.1,1...,.. J) expired.
Waleed bin Muslim says that an inhabitant of Khorasan had a dream
that someone asked him to take the oath when a scarred man of Banu
Umayyah became caliph. He therefore made queries about each
caliph. When Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.iii ...,..J) became caliph, he had a
dream three nights in succession that the same person was telling him
to go and take the oath. At that, he left Khorasan and took the oath at
Umar bin Abdul Aziz's hand.
Habib bin Hind Aslami says that Sayeed bin Musayyib (.iii ...,..J) said to
him, "There are three caliphs. They are Abu Bakr(= .1,1 <?J), Umar (.iii <?J
~) and Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.iii .__.,...J)-" He said to him, " I know the
former two. Who is the third?" He said, "If you remain alive you will
see for yourself. If you die, he will come after you." Ibn Musayyib (.1,1...,·J
had breathed his last before Umar bin Abdul Aziz became caliph. Malik
bin Dinar (.iii ...,..J) relates, "People used to say, 'If anyone can be said to be
a Zahid (ascetic), he is Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 ...,..J)'" . The world came to
him and he renounced it. Yunus bin Abi Shabib says "I had seen Umar
bin Abdul Aziz before he became caliph. Then the belt of his trouser
was sunken into his abdomen due to his plumpness but after he became
caliph he became so thin that each and every bone could be counted."
Umar bin Abdul Aziz's son says," Abu Jafar Mansoor asked me about
his wealth when he .died. I said four hundred dinars and had he lived a
few days more, it would have come down more."

204

The History of Islam

Maslama bin Abdul Malik says, "I visited Umar bin Abdul Aziz
during his sickness. I saw that he was wearing a dirty shirt. I said to
my sister that is, his wife, 'Why don't you wash his shirt'? She said
'He has no other shirt to change into"' . His slave Abu Omayya says,
"One day I said to my master's respectable wife, 'I am sick of eating
lentils'. She said, ' your master eats them daily"'.
One day he said to his wife, " I want to eat grapes. If you have some
money, lend it to me." She said, "I don't have a single dirham. You are
the Amir Al-Muminin (chief of the believers) and you haven't got
enough money to purchase grapes". He said, "It is better to carry
away the longing for grapes buried in my heart than eating abrasions
of chains in hell tomorrow".
His wife states during his caliphate when he used to come home from
outside he would go into Sijda (prostration) and he would fall asleep
weeping. When he awoke, he would start weeping again. Waleed bin
Abi Sayeb says that he had not seen a man greater in fearing Allah
than Umar bin Abdul Aziz (..'i.1 ,,,·J.
Sayeed bin Saweed says that once when Umar bin Abdul Aziz came
to lead the congregational prayer on Friday, he saw his shirt had
patches both in front and in the back. A man said to him, "Amir AI Muminin, Allah has given you everything. Why don't you get new
cloths tailored?" He continued to ponder for some time with his head
bent and then said, "Moderation in prosperity and forgiveness in
power are great things."
One day he said, "Even if I live among you for fifty years, I cannot
take the status of justice to its perfection. I want to do justice and root
out the worldly temptation from your hearts. But I see that your hearts
will not be able to stand it" Ibrahim bin Maisara said to Taoos "Umar
bin Abdul Aziz is Mahdi." He replied, "He is not only Mahdi. He is a
perfect judge too". At the time of his death, people visited him with
plenty of wealth. He said to them. "Take it away and use it." Then he
added his own wealth to it. Juwairia says, "We went to Fatima bint Ali
bin Abi Talib. She praised Umar bin Abdul Aziz very much and said,
'Had he been alive, we would not have run short of anything' ."
According to Auzayi (..'i.1 .._.,)) it was his habit that whenever he wanted

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

205

to punish anybody, he used to keep him in custody for three days as a
precautionary measure so that he might not punish him in a state of
anger or in haste. He said "Whenever I gave to my self anything of its
choice, it willed something better." Umar bin Muhajir says that his
daily wages was fixed at 2 dirhams and his lamp stand was made of
three sticks with clay on them. Once he asked his slave to heat water
for him. The slave went and brought it by heating it in the royal
kitchen. When he came to ~ow where it came from, he sent firewood
worth a dirham to replace it. It was his custom that so long as people
kept sitting by him and talking about affairs of state, he kept the lamp
of the treasury burning and when they left, he put it out and lit his
own lamp.·
The caliphs had a hundred sentinels and city magistrates in regular
attendance of them. When he became caliph, he said to them, "For my
safely destiny and death are sufficient, I don't need you. But even if
any one of you wants to live with me, he would be given ten dinars a
month and if he does not like it, he is at liberty to go and live with
his family"
Umar bin Muhajir says that once he wanted to eat pomegranate. A
relative of his sent some to him. He praised him very much and said
to his slave, "Convey my greetings to the man who has sent it to me
and then give them back to him and tell him that his gift reached the
man concerned." The slave said to him, Amir Al-Muminin your close
relative has sent it to you. What is the harm in accepting it? The
Prophet (~) used to accept gifts". He said," those were gifts for him
(~) but for me it is a bribe." He did not have anyone whipped except a
man who had abused Amir Muawiya(= 11 ',>"'))When he reduced the expenditure of his family, the members
complained. He said, "My wealth is not sufficient to continue your
previous expenditures. As for baitul mal (the treasury), you have as
much right to it as any other Muslims has." Yahya Ghassani states that
when Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 . .,-J appointed him Governor of Mosul,
he saw that thefts were very common there. He informed him and
wanted to know whether he should pass judgment on the basis of
evidence or on that of his personal opinion or intuition. He ordered
that in every case taking evidence was essential. If truth did not reform

206

The History of Islam

them, Allah would never reform them. He complied with the orders and
consequently Mosul turned into the cleanest and safest place.
Raja bin Haiwa says that one day when he was sitting with Umar bin
Abdul Aziz (11.. .-), the lamp went out. His slave was sleeping there.
He wanted to wake him up but Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 ~ ,)
prevented him from doing so. Then the narrator wanted to light the
lamp himself but he said "It is a discourtesy to give trouble to a
guest." Then he himself got up, put oil into the lamp, lighted it and
resumed his seat, and said "I am the same Umar bin Abdul Aziz as
before, lighting the lamp did not affect my status" Ata relates that
Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 ........,) used to gather legal scholars at night and
discussed death and doomsday with them causing him to weep so
much as if there was a dead body in front of him. Abdullah bin Ghabra
says that one day Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 ........,) urged the people in his
khutba (sermon), "O people! Reform your internal affairs and your
external affairs will automatically be reformed and corrected. Act for
the world hereafter and attend to this world in proportion to its need
and remember that death has eaten up your ancestors".
He used to say, "Follow the pious ancestors for they were superior to
you both in character and knowledge." When his son Abdul Malik
died, he began to eulogize him. Maslama said, "Why do you praise
him?" He said, "It should be seen whether the deceased was praise
worthy in my eye6 alone or in the eyes of others too, for in the eyes of
a father the son is always commendable and so his act is unreliable."
Osama bin Zaid's daughter visited him. He welcomed her and sat
down respectfully before her. He gave her whatever she asked for.
Once his relatives said that, they would draw Amir AI-Muminin' s
attention to them through wit and humor. So several persons
assembled and went to him. One of them said something good
humouredly and the others supported him. Umar bin Abdul Aziz
(~1 ....,.._;) said, "You have assembled over a very unworthy thing which
will result in animosity. It is better to learn the Qur' an and the
traditions of the Prophet~ and ponder over the meaning of them" .
Yahya Ghassani states that he forbade the caliph Sulaiman bin Abdul
Malik from killing a certain'. Kharij and advised him to keep him in
captivity until he became penitent. Sulaiman called the Kharij and

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

207

asked him to speak what he wanted. He said, "O corrupted one and
the son of corruption ask what you want to ask." Sulaiman said, "I am
helpless due to Umar bin Abdul Aziz's opinion," Then he called Umar
bin Abdul Aziz (.11 ._...)) and asked him to hear what this person had
said. The Kharij repeated his words. Sulaiman said, "Now tell me
what do you say about this man?" Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.11 . .,-J was
silent for some time and then said "O Amir Al-Muminin, abuse him
too as he has abused you." Caliph Sulaiman said, "No it is not
proper." So, he ordered his execution and he was executed. When he
left, he came across Khalid the city magistrate on the way. He said,
"You gave sage counsel to Amir Al-Muminin that he should abuse
the Kharij as he had abused him however, I was afraid that the Amir
Al-Muminin would order your execution."
Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.11...-J asked whether he would have cut off his
head, had he been ordered to do so. Khalid replied in the affirmative.
When Umar bin Abdul Aziz (.11 . . .~J) became caliph, Khalid came and
stood near him as usual. He ordered Nm to put his sword down and
consider himself dismissed. Then he called Amr bin Mahajir Ansari,
appointed him the city magistrate and said that he had often seen him
reciting the Qur' an and performing his Salat at such a place as none
could have seen him. He used to say, "He who kept away from
disputes, anger and temptations, received salvation." Somebody
advised him to be alert and cautious in the matter of taking food so
that he would not be poisoned. He said "O Allah! If I fear anything
except the Day of Reckoning that You have promised, don't keep me
safe from it." Once he said "O people! Fear Allah and don't wander in
search of livelihood. The allotted livelihood whether buried in a
mountain or in the land must reach you." Azhar states that he saw
him reading the Friday sermon wearing a shirt with patches.
Once he made Amr bin Qais Sakuni the commander of the army of
Saifa and at the time of departure said, "Listen to the pious there and
forgive the wicked. Don't start slaying them as soon as you arrive
there and become notorious later on but be moderate so that they
might not forget your status and keep wanting to listen to you."
Jarrah bin Abdullah, the Governor of Khorasan, wrote to him that the
people there were very rough and they would not be disciplined

without the sword . He wrote back in reply that it was a lie that they
could not be straightened out without the sword. Justice and giving
the people their dues are things that automatically reform the people.
So these two things should be propagated amongst them.
Saleh bin Jubair relates that some times he told him something and he
got angry. Once it was mentioned with reference to a book that people
should fegr a king's displeasure and when his anger cools down, then
they should go before him. After hearing that he said, "Saleh, I allow
you not to apply this restraint in my respect."
Dhahbi says that during Umar bin Abdul Azi.z's regime a man named
Ghailan denied the destiny. He called him and urged him to be
penitent. He told him that had he gone astray he would guide him
then. He (11"''.J) prayed "O Allah! If this man is truthful, it is good and
chop off his hands and feet if he is a liar." Saying this he released him.
Ghailan stuck to his faith and continued to propagate it and caliph
Hisham bin Abdul Malik caught him and cut off his limbs and sent
him to the executioner for his crime.
Once Banu Marwan gathered at Umar bin Abdul Aziz's door and
said to his son, "Go and tell your father that until now all the caliph's
had been endowing us with land and other rewards but you have
deprived us of all these things after becoming caliph." His son
conveyed the message to him. He (11,_,. J asked his son to tell them
that his father said . "~ ( y. ...,.,1~ ..,i; ~ .:., 1 _jL,cl _:/' (I fear, if I disobey my
Lord, have the Penalty of a Mighty Day) [Q.6:15 .]

Khawarij
After reading the conditions up to this point it is clear that the
mischief of the Khawarij continued unabated and at no time was it
stamped out. Whenever a powerful caliph took the throne, they
waited and watched silently and whenever they had an opportunity,
they came out onto the field . Iraq and Khorasan had been the center of
the Khawarij for all their intrigues and rebellions and it was there that
their plots were hatched and reared as will be evident from the
following events. Anyway the Khawarij sometimes openly and
sometimes secretly remained busy with their seditious activities.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

209

When Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 ,___.,,) became caliph and the people
knew of his nobility and piety, the Khawarij too were ashamed to see
his virtue and courtesy and they decided not to undertake any
revolutionary steps against the authority of such a pious caliph as
Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11'-")) and better to postpone all their activities
while a caliph with such angelic traits was present. Therefore, during
his caliphate they did not take up arms against him.
Once they revolted in 'Khorasan. He wrote to the Governor there that
unless they killed someone no step should be taken against them but
keep him of informed of all their activities. Then he (11 v-.,) wrote a
letter to the chief of the Khawarij. I have come to know that you have
stood up in support of Allah and the Prophet (~ ) but in this respect
we are supposed to do it more than you do. Come and discuss and
debate with us. If we are justified, join us, if you are justified, we shall
join you." After reading the letter, the chief of the Khawarij sent two
of his most clever followers for the debate. They came and debated
with Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 •-•'J. The Khawarij said, "Your
ancestors, Banu Umayyah were unbelievers and cursing them is
obligatory." Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 .__.-..)) said, "You have never
cursed even Pharaoh though he was an unbeliever. Don't take cursing
to be essential. How can they be labeled as unbelievers who believed
in Tawhid and the Risa/ah (Message) and practiced the pillars of
Islam?" The result of the debate was that one of the Khawarij
renounced his group and joined the general Muslim population. The
rest of the Khawarij kept silent and suspended all their activities.

Death
It has been mentioned previously that Banu Umayyah were extremely
displeased with Umar bin Abdul Aziz because their lands, property
and wealth- which they had taken over, were confiscated and no
further illegal gratifications were given by his government. Finally,
their patience wore thin and they planned to murder him. Murdering
him was not a tough job for he never kept bodyguards nor did he take
precautions in matters of eating and drinking. The best way of
removing him, they thought, was by poison, therefore, they allured
his slave and made him their accomplice and he poisoned Umar bin

The History of Islam

210

Abdul Aziz (11 •----•'). After he was poisoned, he became aware of it.
When the pain became excruciating, the people advised him to take an
antidote. He said that at the time of my poisoning if some body had
said that I could get well by touching the lobe of my ear, I would not
have touched it."
Mujahid relates that once he (11 ...---J) asked him what the people said
about him (11 ._....J), He replied that they believed that a spell was cast
OR him. He replied that he was not charmed, and that he knew at once
when he was administered poison. Then he called his slave who had
poisoned him. When he came, he said to him, "Alas! You have
poisoned me. What tempted you to do so"? He said that he was given
one thousand dinars plus a promise of liberty. He (.iii ...., J) asked him to
bring those dinars to him. He brought them to him. He had them
deposited in the bait al mal (treasury) at once and ordered the slave to
run away, so that he-might not be seen any longer.
Obaid bin Hassan (11 ...---J) says that when his end came and the pain of
death started, he asked the people to leave him alone and everybody
went out. Maslama bin Abdul Malik and his wife Fatima bint Abdul
Malik remained standing at the door. They heard him say, "Bismillah
(In the Name of Allah), Please come. These faces are neither of men
nor jinn", and then he recited the verse:

That House of the Hereafter We shall give to those who intend

When no more voices were audible, they both entered and found him
dead. He died on the 25 th of Rajab 1OlA.H. at Dairsaman in Hims after
remaining Caliph for two years five months and four days. When
Imam Hasan Basri ( 11 ...--- J) was informed of his death, he said, "Alas!
The best man in the world has died'; . Qatada says that Umar bin
Abdul Aziz wrote a note to Yazid bin Abdul Malik that read, "In the
name of Allah who is most Beneficent and most Merciful. This is from
the slave of Allah Umar bin Abdul Aziz to Yazid bin Abdul Malik.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

211

After greeting with peace, I praise Allah except Him there is no~ther
God. I write this letter to you in a state of great torment. I know that I
will be questioned about the period of my rule and the questioner is
the Master of the world and the hereafter. It is not possible for me to
hide any act of mine from Him. If He is pleased with me, I receive
salvation otherwise I will be ruined. I ask Him to forgive me by His
grace, protect me from the punishment of hell and, being pleased, give
me paradise. You must fear Allah and make allowances for the
people. You will also not live long in this world after I die."

Children and Wives
He left three wives and eleven sons . His wife Fatima bint Abdul
Malik was as gentle and pious as she was a Caliph's daughter, a
Caliph' s sister and a Caliph's wife. She lived a life of abstinence. His
sons Ishaq, Yaqub, Musa, Abdullah, Bakr, Ibrahim were born of his
wives and the rest Abdul Malik, Waleed, Asim, Yazid, Abdullah,
Abdul Aziz and Rayyan were born of slavegirls. His son Abdul
Malik resembled his father in many respects. He often said, "My
son, Abdul Malik, inspires me with good deeds and prayers" but he
died in his lifetime.
The inheritance that he left came to a sum of 21 dinars. Some of it was
spent on his burial and the rest was distributed among his sons and
daughters. Abdur Rahman bin Qasim bin Mohammad bin Abu Bakr
says that Umar bin Abdul Aziz (11 ..,..~) left eleven sons and Hisham
also left eleven sons. Umar bin Abdul Aziz' s sons received one dinar
each in inheritance and Hisham bin Abdul Malik's sons inherited from
their father a sum of one million dirhams each. The narrator saw one
of Umar bin Abdul Aziz's sons giving away 100 horses for jihad and
one of Hisham's sons was found taking charity from the people.

A Glance at Umar bin Abdul Aziz's Administration
Umar bin Abdul Aziz' s period as caliph like Abu Bakr's (= 11 ~~) was
very short. But just as Abu Bakr Siddiq's regime was very important
and invaluable, similarly Umar bin Abdul Aziz's was very precious
for the world of Islam. Banu Umayyah's rule had created in the people
a love for worldly prosperity, ego and power, this made them

I
'!'':

i'

212

The History of Islam

indifferent to the hereafter. Umar bin Abdul Aziz's caliphate in a very
short time removed those evils and inclined them to spiritualism and
righteous deeds. His greatest achievement was that he set the Islamic
caliphate on the model of the rightly guided caliphs and restored the
style of government of Abu Bakr Siddiq and Umar bin Khattab (.'iii ~ J
~) to the world.
He hated repression and tyranny perpetrated by a Caliph. By
establishing liberty and peace in the world, he wanted every
individual to profit from their human rights. He did not want even an
atheist to feel compelled. He even gave the Khawarij opportunities to
give vent to their feelings . He wanted to see the status of the Caliph of
the Muslims established but only to the extent that justice was
maintained. Even if a.criminal verbally abused a Caliph, the most the
Caliph could do would be to retaliate in like manner, in other words
his retaliation should not go beyond verbally abusing the criminal. He
never wanted his subordinates to agree to his proposals without
reference to lslamic law. He regarded a Caliph not as the ruler but as
an affectionate father of the Muslims. In short, whatever we have seen
during the regimes of Abu Bakr Siddiq (~ .'iii~.;) and Umar bin
Khattab ('-"' .'iii ~ J) all the essentials were also apparent during Umar
bin Abdul Aziz's administration. It can justifiably be said that with
Umar bin Abdul Aziz's death, the rightly guided caliphate came to an
end . During the period of his caliphate, many people embraced Islam
willingly. These large numbers of converts have not been found in the
time of other caliphs although only a few military expeditions were
fought in his time. His authority extended from Sindh, Punjab,
Bukhara, and Turkistan in the east to Morocco, Spain and France in
the west. People enjoyed absolute peace everywhere although the
Islamic domain was vast in size.
During his administration, new roads were made, schools and
hospitals were built in every state. The world has never seen the
prevalence of true justice to such a degree again. Because of the
peoples' awareness of this, his death was mourned not only in the
houses of the Muslims but also the Christians and Jews were found
even more distressed. The Christian clergy in their monasteries and
churches ruefully mourned saying that justice, the one who
established it and its protector has left the world.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

213

Umar bin Abdul Aziz put an end to the distinction of Shia, Sunni and
Khawarij. Until the present, there is no one who harbors any ill feeling
against him from ~ny sect. The opportunity is there for everyone to
think and reflect over the fact that whoever follows Islam most closely
becomes most beloved by all. His personality was the embodiment of
what Islam is, the people of all religions.responded to it. The closer a
ruler comes to living Islam in its reality the greater the response from
his people. The life of Umar bin Abdul Aziz was an example of this.
The Europeans hold Abu Bakr .JJ;,, Umar bin Khattab .iJ;, Umar bin
Abdul Aziz, Nuruddin Zangi and Salahuddin Ayyubi in great
reverence due to their nobility, wisdom and graciousness. They
should also reflect on how close they followed Islam and that all their
qualities were totally dependent on this single fact. They were true
Muslims and they tried to follow Islam both in letter and spirit. We
know that Umar bin Abdul Aziz was the ruler of the greatest empire
in the world at the time and we also find him giving the Friday
sermon from the pulpit wearing a patched shirt, as students of history
we can be justly astonished. What kind of sense of duty and
responsibility can there be in a man who had lived in great comfort
and luxury but after assuming the office of caliph was reduced to skin
and bones within a two and a half year period?

Yazid bin Abdul Malik
Abu Khalid Yazid bin Abdul Malik bin Marwan sat on the throne as
caliph in accordance with the will of his brother Sulaiman bin Abdul
Malik. When he acceded to the throne, he said, "I need Allah more than
Umar bin Abdul Aziz." Hence, he followed his footsteps for forty days.
When Banu Umayyah saw that even after Umar bin Abdul Aziz no
solution to their problem was forthcoming, they tried to induce Yazid
bin Abdul Malik to adopt a pro-Banu Umayyah policy. All such
efforts proved futile before Umar bin Abdul Aziz but Yazid bin Abdul
Malik was not Umar bin Abdul Aziz. After a bit of effort he was swept
off his feet. The details of how it happened follow. Forty white haired
bearded men came to his palace and stood witness that whatever he
as caliph did, he would not be held accountable nor would he be
punished in hell. The plan met with instant success. His ignorance led

214

The History of Islam

him slowly and gradually to decadence until he began to drink wine
and take drugs like Yazid I. He was the first caliph who openly drank
wine and wasted his time in singing and playing on musical
instruments. Banu Umayyah. then had many opportunities for
exploitation. They imposed themselves upon the caliph's court and
squashed all the amendments and reformations interfering with their
capturing lands and property illegally and they were worse in matters
of justice. The downfall of the caliphate of Banu Umayyah started
with Umar bin Abdul Aziz's death. This was the time when Banu
Abbas and Hashimites had a golden chance of maneuvering against
Banu Umayyah.
Mohammad bin Yusuf, Hajjaj bin Yusuf Thaqfi's brother, had during
his regime, levied a new tax on the Yemenis which Umar bin Abdul
Aziz during his caliphate abolished and fixed a one tenth tax and said,
"Compared to the fixation of this tax I would prefer not to receive
even a single dirham of tax from Yemen." When Yazid bin Abdo!
Malik became caliph, he wrote to the governor of Yemen that he must
collect the old tax that was originally imposed by Muhammad bin
Yusuf from the Yemenis however displeased they might become.
Yazid's uncle Mohammad bin Marwan, the governor of Azerbaijan,
died at that same time and he sent brother, Maslama bin Abdul Malik,
as governor in his place.
It has been recorded earlier that Umar bin Abdul Aziz interned Yazid
bin Muhallab for embezzling from the taxes of Jurjan. He remained in
jail until he heard that Umar bin Abdul Aziz was poisoned by Banu
Umayyah and he had very little chance of surviving. There had been
an estrangement between Yazid bin Muhallab and Yazid bin Abdul
Malik since the time of Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik. When Yazid.bin
Muhallab came to know that Umar bin Abdul Aziz's life was in
mortal danger and Yazid bin Abdul Malik was to succeed him, he
heavily bribed those guarding him and fled so that Yazid bin Abdul
Malik would not have a chance to take revenge on him. He fled from
the jail and went towards Basra. While fleeing, he sent a note to Umar
bin Abdul Aziz that said, "If I had been sure you would survive, I
would never have escaped from your punishment. However, fearing
that Yazid bin Abdul Malik will kill me mercilessly after you, I am

fleeing from here." The note reached Umar bin Abdul Aziz when he
was at the point of death. Having read the letter he said, "O Allah! If
Yazid bin Muhallab has run away to cause harm to the Muslims,
punish him for he has cheated me. When Yazid bin Abdul Malik
became caliph, he briefed the governor of Basra named Adi bin Artat
about Yazid' s flight and asked him to arrest his family . Adi arrested
his sons, Mofaddal and Marwan, and threw them· into prison.
Meanwhile Yazid bin Muhallab arrived in Basra. The Basraites
supported him and so Adi was forced to escape from Basra . Yazid bin
Muhallab occupied Basra and extended his rule up to Ahwaz and
founded a kingdom with a large army. He induced the Iraqis into
believing that declaring a Jihad on the Syrians was better than fighting
the Turks.
[Editors note: The Turks referred to here are not the Turks of modern
day Turkey but the Turkic tribes from the areas north of present day
Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan until and including parts of modern day
China. These Turkic tribes were not Muslim at the time, so to declare
jihad on Syrians who were Muslims and forgo jihad on the Turkic
tribes who were non-Muslims without very exceptional circumstances
is not sanctioned by Islam.)
Imam Hasan Basri opposed it but the people, fearing that Yazid bin
Muhallab would kill him, compelled him to keep quiet. Yazid led the
army to Kufa. Yazid bin Abdul Malik came to know about the
invasion and sent his brotner Maslama Abdul Malik with an army. A
bloody battle took place and both sides fought bravely and heroically.
Finally, Yazid bin Muhallab and his brother Habib were killed on the
battlefield and Maslama bin Abdul Malik was victorious. When the
rest of the descendents of Muhallab were informed of the death of
Yazid and Habib and the defeat of the army, they escaped from Basra
and set out towards the east by boat. A regiment was sent after them
and there was a confrontation between them at Qandabeel. The whole
of Muhallab's family, except two children Abu Arba bin Muhallab
and Uthrnan bin Mofaddal, were killed.
After the battle, Yazid bin Abdul Malik made Maslama bin Abdul
Malik the governor of Iraq and then in place of the latter he fixed Amr
bin Hubaira as the Administrator of Iraq. When the inhabitants of

216

The History of Islam

Safad and Samarkand took arms against him, Amr bin Hubaira
deputed Sayeed Harshi as the Amir of Khorasan and sent him to
Khorasan with an army. He went there and punished them.
There was a rebellion in Khazar (covering the southeastern section of
modern European Russia and in their early history up to the
Caucasus) and Armenia. The people there took reinforcements from
the people of Qabehaq and invaded the Muslims and put to death the
greater part of the Islamic army. After the defeat, they went to Yazid
bin Abdul Malik in Damascus. Yazid gave an army to Jarrah bin
Abdullah Hakami who went there and waged a battle in which the
Muslims defeated them. Jarrah continued his march onwards and
captured new territories. Their leaders surrendered to him and the
entire region came under the occupation of the Muslims.
Abdur Rahman bin Dhahak had been governing the Hijaz since Umar
bin Abdul Aziz's time. He remained at that post for three years and at
that time wanted to marry Husain bin Ali's~ grand daughter. He
sent the message to Fatima bint Husain ~ , the bride's mother. She
refused. He then threatened that he would accuse her son of drinking
wine and have him lashed . She sent a complaint to Yazid bin Abdul
Malik. Yazid flew into a rage when he heard about it, and
immediately wrote a letter to Abdul Wahid bin Abdullah Qasri in his
own hand informing him that he appointed him the governor of
Madinah and so he should go to lbn Dhahak at once and depose him
and collect forty thousand 'dinars' from him as a fine and torture him
so much that his cries should be audible to him (the caliph) although
he was at rest in his bed in Damascus. The envoy delivered the letter
to Abdul Wahid. Abdul Wahid took charge of the governorship of
Madinah and began to torture Dhahak. The people were not pleased
with Dhahak and so after his dismissal satirical poems were composed
about him. Abdul Wahid treated the Madinaites well. Everyone was
pleased with him and Abdullah bin Urnar's sons, Qasim and Salim,
were advisors in all his activities. Ibn Dhahak's dismissal and Abdul
Wahid's appointment took place in Shawwal 104 A.H.
As mentioned earlier, Sayeed Huraishi was the Administrator of
Khorasan. After a short time, Ibn Hubaira dismissed Huraishi and put
Muslim bin Sayeed bin Aslam bin Zara Kalabi in charge of Khorasan.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

217

lbn Hubaira continued to govern throughout Yazid bin Abdul Malik's
administration.
Yazid bin Abdul Malik had made his brother Hisham bin Abdul
Malik and after him his own son Waleed bin Yazid the heir-apparent.
After ruling for four years and one month Yazid bin Abdul Malik died
on 25 Shaban 105 A.H. at the age of 38 and then Hisham bin Abdul
Malik succeeded him in keeping with Yazid's will.

Hisham bin Abdul Malik
Abu! Waleed Hisham bin Abdul Malik was born in 72 A.H. His
mother was Aysha bint Hashim bin Ismail Makhzumi. When Yazid
bin Abdul Malik died, Hisham was in Hims. A messenger went there
with news of Yazid's death, his staff and ring. Hisham left Hims and
came to Damascus and took the oath for his caliphate.
Following his accession Hisham bin Abdul Malik dismissed lbn
Hubaira from the governorship of Iraq and replaced him by Khalid
bin Abdullah Qasri by conferring on him the certificate of
governorship. It has been mentioned above that Muslim bin Sayeed
was appointed the administrator of Khorasan. He invaded the Turks
and remained at war with them until the end of 105 A.H. he defeated
them and collected the taxes due from them.

Events in Khorasan
In 106 A.H. Muslim bin Sayeed collected a large army with the
purpose of Jihad and went to Bukhara and Farghana to punish the
rebels. The Chinese leader helped the Farghanaites. Many bloody
battles were waged between the Chinese leader and Muslim bin
Sayeed leading ultimately to the Chinese leader's defeat and the
capture of many important leaders of the Turks by the Muslims. That
same year. the caliph in Damascus, Hisham bin Abdul Malik, wrote a
letter to Khalid bin Abdullah asking him to depose Muslim bin Sayeed
from the governorship of Khorasan and to send his brother Asad bin
Abdullah Qasri to take his place. Khalid bin Abdullah therefore gave
to his brother Asad bin Abdullah the certificate of governorship of
Khorasan and sent him. Muslim bin Sayeed handed over the

i

!
I

I

218

The History of Islam

governorship of Khorasan willingly. When Khalid bin Abdullah sent
his brother Asad bin Abdullah as the ruler of Khorasan, he had sent
Abdur Rahman bin Nairn as his deputy.
Immediately after taking over the administration of Khorasan, Asad
bin Abdullah launched attacks on Herat and Ghowr (modern Ghowr
in west-central Afghanistan) . The Muslims collected large amounts of
spoils of war there. In those battles, Nasr bin Sayyar and Muslim bin
Ahwar achieved renown. After a very short time Asad bin Abdullah
displayed such a strong personal nature that he made the people
worried and terrified. He had Nasr bin Sayyar lasHed a hundred
times, had Abdur Rahman's head shaved and then sent them to his
brother Khalid bin Abdullah saying that they were accomplices in a
conspiracy to murder him.
In the same way, he used to abuse' the people of Khorasan and dealt
harshly with them. When caliph Hisham was informed of it, he wrote
to Khalid bin Abdullah to depose Asad bin Abdullah from the
governorship of Khorasan. Then of his own accord he sent Ashras bin
Abdullah Aslami as the governor of Khorasan and informed Khalid
accordingly. When Ashras arrived in Khorasan, he pleased all with his
kind treatment and good behavior. From there in 110 A.H. he sent
Abu Saida Saleh bin Zareef and Rabi bin Imran Tamimi to Samarkand
and Mawaraunnahr (between the Amu [Oxus] and Syr rivers in
modern Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) with a view to convincing the
inhabitants of the qualities of Islam and bring them on the right path
by making them aware of the evils of Shirk. Rebellions were common
in those territories and Islamic rule was maintained by the point of
sword. Ashras prescribed the best remedy, the people were educated
in Islam and then converted to it. That naturally removed the evils
from their lives and then their understanding removed the danger to
Islamic rule. The result of this form of invitation to Islam was that
people began to enter Islam in large numbers.
When the people started embracing Islam, the revenue from Jizya that
was collected from the Dhimmis came down.
[Editors Note: Jizya: A tax paid by non-Muslims living under an
Islamic Government. Since the non-Muslims are exempt from military
service and taxes imposed on Muslims, they must pay this tax to

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

219

compensate. It guarantees them security and protection. If the State
cannot protect those who paid jizya, then the amount they paid is
returned to them. Dhimmis: non-Muslims who have paid the jizya and
have the right to protection and are not expected to pay another type
of tax.]
When the Dhimmis began to convert to Islam the revenue was
reduced, Hasan bin Umar Taha, the Revenue Officer of Samarkand,
wrote a letter of complaint to Ashras bin Abdullah Aslami, the
governor of Khorasan. Ashras replied, "Most of them might have
converted to Islam only for the sake of avoiding the Jizya and they
may not have converted from the core of their hearts. Please see if
they have been circumcised and make their Salat (obligatory prayer)
in which case they should be excused from paying the Jizya, otherwise
collect it from the rest of them despite their claim that they are
Muslims." Ashras actually disapproved of this method but Khalid and
Hisham desired that the converts should be dealt with strongly . On
the receipt of this reply from Ashras, Hasan bin Umar Taha hesitated
in its compliance simply because it was against Islamic Shariah (legal
code). Ashras dismissed him and sent Hani ibn Hani in his place
retaining his previous posts of the governorship and military
commander of Samarkand. Hani came and began the collection
campaign. Abu Saida stopped the converts from paying Jizya and
forbid Hani to collect it. Hani wrote to Ashras that they had accepted
Islam and had built mosques and so how could he collect Jizya from
them. He received the reply that he must collect it from those who
used to pay it regardless if they had embraced Islam or not.
In view of the situation, Abu Saida collected seven thousand converts
and taking them encamped a few miles away from Samarkand to
fight. Since he was justified, many Muslim leaders parted with the
army of Samarkand and went to him in support of the converts. When
Ashras realized the situation, he dismissed Hani from the
governorship of Samarkand and deputed Mahshar bin Muzahim
Sulami in -his . place. Mahshar reached Samarkand, called Abu Said
and his associates on the pretext of reconciliation and imprisoned
them and then sent-them to Ashras. The converts selected Abu Fatima
as their chief. Finally, those Muslims were exempted from paying the

220

The History of Islam

Jizya, when their unity and collective power declined, they began to
be dealt with harshly and humiliated in different ways. The
consequences of these actions were disastrous. Those who had
embraced Islam, turned apostate and rebelled and prepared to fight
they requested the leader of the Chinese to help them. The Chinese
emperor came with a large army and started a series of battles against
the Muslims. Ashras himself came to fight and both armies fought
heroically many Muslims and Turks were killed and finally, it ended
in reconciliation.
At this point, let us reflect on the commonly held concept that Islam
was spread by the sword. We should pause and think whether the
Muslims in general used the sword for the propagation of Islam or did
a few foolish rulers among them use the power of the sword to stop it
from spreading.
In 111 A.H., Hisham bin Abdul Malik dismissed Ashras while he was
at war with the Turks and·samarkandis and replaced him by Junaid
bin Abdur Rahman bin Omar bin Harith bin Kharja bin Sanan bin Abi
Harsa Murri. When Junaid arrived in the capital city of Merv, he did
not find Ashras, who was in the field, but his deputy Khattab bin
Mehraz Sulami. He stayed there for a day and then marched to
Mawaraunnahr leaving Mahshar bin Muzahim Sulami in Merv and
took Khattab with him. He along with Ashras defeated the Chinese
leader and the inhabitants of Bukhara and returned to Merv at the end
of 111 A. H . Then he deputed Qatan bin Qutaiba bin Muslim to
Bukhara, Waleed bin Qaqa Absi to Herat and Muslim bin Abdur
Rahman Sahli to Balkh but after a few days, he dismissed Muslim bin
Abdur Rahman and put Yahya bin Zabya in charge of Balkh.
In 112 A.H., Junaid sent Amara bin Maryam with an army of eighteen
thousand fighters and Ibrahim bin Bassam with ten thousand warriors
from another side to Tukharistan and its capital, Balkh (now part of
northern Afghanistan) in order to discipline the rebels. He also started
preparing to go there. When the Turks found out these armies were
headed in their direction, they made the Chinese leader their
Commander-in-chief and gathered a huge army and invaded
Samarkand. At that time the governor of Samarkand was Sura bin
Aljabr. He informed Junaid that The Chinese leader was marching

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

221

towards Samarkand with a large army and he should send him
reinforcements at once. Mahshar bin Muzahim advised Junaid that he
should march towards Samarkand with a minimum of fifty thousand
soldiers because fighting the Turks would not be an easy task. Because
his army was decimated and he had only a small number of soldiers
left with him, so he was advised not go to Samarkand. Junaid heaved
a sigh and said, "How is it possible that my brother Sura bin Aljabr is
in trouble and I should remain sitting here waiting to collect fifty
thousand soldiers?" Saying this, he set out for Samarkand. When the
Chinese leader and the Turks were informed that Junaid himself was
on way to Samarkand, they left a small army to continue the siege of
Samarkand and intercepted him on the way and they began to fight.
Junaid and his handful of friends fought so bravely and heroically that
the Turks were confounded. Some of the Muslims fighters were killed
while the dead bodies of the Turks started to pile up.
The number of the Turkish and Chinese soldiers was very large.
Keeping the mountain at his back Junaid pushed them to the rear and
made the Turks retreat. Finally, at the instance of his commanders
Sura bin Aljabr in Samarkand was informed, "We are fighting at a
short distance from you. Gather your courage and come out of
Samarkand and join us, you should advance along the canal and
attack the Turks from the opposite flank." Sura bin Aljabr set out but
contrary to the directions given to him he changed course with the
result that he quickly became surrounded by the Turks and many of
his soldiers were killed . Because of this Junaid was denied any
reinforcements. Finally, the Muslims launched more fierce attacks and
put the Turks and fhe Chinese leader to rout.
He sent a detailed report through a fast messenger to Hisham bin
Abdul Malik in Damascus. The Caliph ordered the governors of Kufa
and Basra each to send a force of ten thousand armed men to Junaid.
He asked Junaid to continue fighting and that he was sending twenty
thousand soldiers, thirty thousand spears and thirty thousand swords
to reinforce him from Kufa and Basra. The message reached Junaid in
Samarkand and' he remained at his post.
After only a few days, he heard that the Chinese leader who had fled
from Junaid was thinking of attacking Bukhara and was gathering an

!:

222

The History of Islam

army. Bukhara was governed by Qatan bin Qutaiba. Junaid was afraid
that Qatan might meet the same fate that Sura had met in Samarkand
so he left Uthman bin Abdullah with four hundred cavaliers and
arranged all of the necessary provisions for him. Then along with his
women and children and the necessary supplies, he left Samarkand
and moved towards Bukhara. The confrontation between him and the
Chinese leader took place at Kominia near Towees on the first of
Ramadan 112 A.H. Junaid was victorious, he found the way ahead
clear and tontinued to Bukhara. Once again, he had to fight the Turks
on the way and defeated them. Finally, he entered Bukhara and at that
time the armies of Kufa and Basra also arrived there.
By constantly inflicting defeat on the Turks, he established peace in
Khorasan. When he had established security in Khorasan, he married
Fadila bint Yazid bin Muhallab. The Caliph, Hisham bin Abdul Malik,
had a strong dislike against the Muhallab family and when he
received the news of the marriage, he was displeased and dismissed
Junaid from the governorship of Khorasan. He sent Asim bin
Abdullah bin Yazid Hilali with the certificate of governorship of
Khorasan, to replace him. While Asim was traveling to Khorasan, the
condition of Junaid who suffered from dropsy worsened . The day he
entered Merv, Junaid had died on the previous day. Asim upon
arrival to Khorasan, dismissed all the governors appointed by Junaid
and appointed his own.

Harith bin Shuraih
Banu Abbas had started a series of secret maneuvers to establish their
caliphate and destroy that of Banu Umayyah in 100 A.H. when Umar
bin Abdul Aziz 11 '°'') was Caliph. These conspiracies were conceived
and carried out with great care and wisdom. A few particular Hadiths
(statements) of the Prophet ~ were given much publicity and some
were fabricated expediently. To some statements, a few sentences
were added and all of them were designed to convince the masses that
the Islamic Caliphate was destined to come to Banu Abbas very soon.
Since the insurgent parties had been using Banu Hashim's claim to
caliphate and the illegal capture of power of Banu Umayyah as a
weapon, these factors were exaggerated and manipulated . For this

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

223

particular mission specially qualified persons were pressed into
service. Banu Umayyah, in their intoxication of power never attached
much importance to these ploys nor did they think it necessary to
stamp them out nor did they like to involve themselves in the
investigation of these types of secret intrigues.
In parallel with the Abbasids, the Fatimids and Alawiites also had
been carrying on similar manipulations and conspiracies for a long
time and all of these conspiracies had been nurtured in Khorasan
because the atmosphere there was most suitable for them. Harith bin
Shuraih, the chief of the well-known tribe of Azd in Khorasan was
captivated with the ideas of the Alawiites and the Fatimids. In 116
A.H., he wore black clothes and invited people to the Qur'an and
Sunnah and to pledge themselves to Imam Rada, arriving in Faryab,
he started the mission.
[Editor's note: Black was the color of the Abbasids therefore it
indicated opposition to the Umayyahs. Invitation to the Book and
Sunnah refers to the Qur' an and the traditions of the Prophet
Muhammad ~- These are unassailably correct and all Muslims agree
on them and every political activist knows the people will support
such a platform. The oath of allegiance to Imam Rada however, was
the political objective of Harith bin Shuraih.
Four thousand dedicated people gathered round him. He led the army
towards Balkh, which at that time was ruled by Nasr bin Sayyar. He
came out with ten thousand soldiers to fight but was defeated. Harith
bin Shuraih captured Balkh, deputed Sulaiman bin Abdullah bin
Hazim there and marched towards Jurjan. He easily occupied it and
then moved towards Merv. In Merv Asim bin Abdullah wanted to
persuade the people to gather and fight but Harith bin Shuraih had
won them to his side through secret corre~pondences.
Harith had gathered sixty thousand people around him that included
the well known chiefs of Azd and Tamim and the large land owners of
Faryab and Taliqan. Asim bin Abdullah had made all possible
preparations to repel the attack. Harith invaded Merv with great
courage but just at the time the battle began four thousand people of
the Azd and Tamim tribes deserted him and joined Asim' s army. That

224

The History of Islam

resulted in the lessening of the fighting spirit of Harith's troops but
the battle continued on unabated. Harith eventually had to retreat and
Asim did not pursue them. When Asim reached Rahban and
encamped there, he had a cavalry of only three thousand men that
remained wit[) him. Harith then steadied himself and began to fortify
and build up his captured territory and put it on a war footing.
When informed of the situation Hisham bin Abdul Malik from
Damascus asked Asim to explain, the latter repJied that because
Khorasan's authority was directly linked to the caliph's court delay
was caused in sending news and receiving reinforcements on time. It
was therefore appropriate, he argued, that just as the province of
Khorasan was once under Iraq, similarly it should be brought under
Iraq again, so that help from both Basra and Kufa could arrive in time.
Hisham appreciated the idea but dismissed him from the
governorship of Khorasan and wrote to the governor of Iraq Khalid
bin Abdullah Qasri to make his brother Asad bin Abdullah the
.governor of Khorasan.
When Asim became aware of his dismissal and of the new
arrangements, he reconciled with Harith bin Shuraih and said to him,
"Come and let us write a missionary letter to him and invite him to
follow the Book and the Sunnah. If he refuses we will jointly try to
oppose him." But the reconciliation did not last long nor did it bear
fruit. Both disagreed on some point and the disagreement escalated to
the extent that they began fighting against each other.
In the battle, Harith was defeated and most of his supporters were
arrested and killed by Asim. Asim wanted to please Hisham bin
Abdul Malik with the victory but Asad bin Abdullah had almost
reached there with the certificate of governorship and as soon as he
arrived, he arrested Asim
This happened in 117 A.H., immediately after taking control of
Khorasan, Asad began to take back the cities of Khorasan from Harith.
He captured Balkh and then turned to Termiz (city jn southern
Uzbekistan) . In brief, he remained at war with Harith and the Turks
for two years. Harith's condition deteriorated considerably and he
along with a few followers of his, continued to search for a place to
take refuge. In 119 A.H., two important Chinese leaders were killed

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

225

while fighting against the Islamic army and the chain of Asad' s
victories crossed Turkistan and reached western China.
In Rabia al-Awwal 120 A.H., Asad died in Balkh. At the time of his
death, he declared Jafar bin Hanzala Nahrwani to be his deputy who
remained at this post for four months. After that in Rajab, Nasr bin
Sayyar was made the governor of Khorasan. That same year, 1. 20 A.H.
the enemies of the Iraqi governor, Khalid bin Abdullah complained to
Hisham bin Abdul Malik against him with the result that the he was
dismissed and replaced by Yusuf bin Umar Thaqfi. While Yusuf did
not indulge in vices and performed the obligatory religious duties he
was at the same time merciless and foolish.
When Nasr bin Sayyar took over the governmental responsibilities he
first tried to stop the unjust practice of the collecting the Jizya from the
converts. He was able to put an end to it and an immediate impact
was seen, Islam started spreading among the Turks very rapidly.

Cities of Khadar and Armenia
Hisham bin Abdul Malik appointed Jarrah bin Abdullah Hakami the
governor of Armenia. In 111 A.H. Jarrah, making Jihad from the side
of Taflees e~tered Turkistan and after capturing the famous city of
Baiza, he returned. In 112 A.H., the Turks arrayed their joint armies
and attacked the Islamic territory. Jarrah came out to face them. Both
fought at the plain of Ardabil (town in northwestern Iran, 38 miles
from the Caspian Sea). The Muslims were outnumbered and Jarrah
met his martyrdom fighting b'ut not before making his brother Hajjaj
bin Abdullah Hakami his deputy. Jarrah's death encouraged the
Turkmen and the Turks in their intoxication of victory advanced
near to Mosil.
When the news reached the capital of Damascus, Hisham bin Abdul
Malik called Sayeed Huraishi and said to him, "Jarrah fled after being
defeated." Sayeed said, "Jarrah feared Allah more than running away
after defeat. He could not tolerate the shame of defeat at the hands of
the Turks plus flight. I think he met his martyrdom." Hisham said,
"What should be done now?" Sayeed said, "Please send me there with
only forty men and keep sending forty men daily, also send orders to

226

The History of Islam

all the governors and administrators to extend reinforcements to me if
need be."
Hisham liked the idea and Sayeed set out with forty men. They met
Jarrah's defeated comrades on the way. Sayeed took them with him
and wherever he passed by tribes of Muslims, he induced them to join
the Jihad. In this way, people continued to join him everywhere. At
Khalat, he fought the Turks. After a fierce battle, the Turks suffered a
defeat and the Muslims captured a large amount of spoils of war.
Then Sayeed encamped at Barzgha. The Turks had besieged Warsan.
Sayeed informed the people of Warsan of the arrival of the Islamic
forces and threatened the Turks to either lift the siege or face them.
The Turks were terrifiedand they raised the siege and left. Sayeed
entered Warsan and then continued to advance up to Ardabil and
encamped there. He was informed that an army of ten thousand Turks
was encamping at a distance of eight miles from there and they had
five thousand Muslim captives with them. Sayeed attacked at night,
killed all ten thousand Turks and freed the Muslim captives. He set
out for Bajarwan while a spy informed him that another army of
Turks was encamping near by. Sayeed led a night attack there also
and freed all the Muslim captives after killing all the Turks. Jarrah's
sons and other members of his family were among the captives, the
Turks then rallied again and prepared a large army and fought with
the Muslims at Zarand. The Turks had to retreat after a fierce battle.
Trying to recover some of their losses, they again prepared for a
confrontation and retaliation and assembled along the side of Began
River. Sayeed arrived and started the fight. Many Turks were killed
_and of those who escaped most were drowned in the river.
Following the victory Huraishi returned to Bajarwan and encamped
there and sent the good news of his victories to Caliph Hisham with
the fifth part of the spoils of war. Hisham then recalled Huraishi to
Damascus and sent his own brother Maslama bin Abdul Malik with
the documents of governorship to Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Turks again rallied after Sayeed's departure. They prepared a
huge army with a vast amount of weapons and provisions. Maslama
was a veteran commande~ and a brave person. It was not out of
cowardice but out of shortage of men and a good estimation of the

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

227

enemies strength that he moved the Muslims' weapons, provisions,
women and children to Derbent (city in Dagestan republic in
southwestern Russia) to avoid the risk of them being captured by the
Turks. During his one and a half or two-year rule, he treated the Turks
in Armenia kindly, which helped to discourage them from revolting
against the Muslims. Following Maslama's arrival at Derbent, Marwan
bin Mohammad bin Marwan who was in Maslama's army, left and
went to Damascus. He complained to Hisham about Maslama stating
that he dealt with the Turks in Armenia and Azerbaijan with great
leniency, which encouraged them to revolt and when he was expected
to fight them, he retreated and returned to Derbent. He claimed that if
the caliph provided him with 120,000 warriors and sent him there, he
would straighten out the problem with the Turks completely.
Hisham bin Abdul Malik agreed to his request and gave him the
number of warriors he asked for and sent him to the cities of Khadar
and Armenia. Meanwhile Maslama became sick and died in Derbent.
When the Turks saw such a huge army with Marwan, they lost their
nerve and surrendered. Marwan as he had said, completely corrected
the situation and restored peace in the entire region of Armenia and
Khadar. Hisham sent Marwan to Armenia in 114 A.H.

Caesar of Rome
During Hisham bin Abdul Malik's regime, the Muslims defeated
Caesar' s army repeatedly. Summer and winter armies had been
reserved in the north for launching attacks since Amir Muawiya's times.
Those summer and winter armies continued to invade Constantinople
and Caesar's territories and because of this constant onslaught, the
Romans were overawed by the Muslims. In Hisham's time princes like
Muawiya bin Hisham, Sayeed bin Hisham, Sulaiman bin Hisham,
Maslama bin Abdul Malik, Marwan bin Mohammad, Abbas bin
Waleed all led attacks on them. Famous commanders like Abdullah
Batta! and Abdul Wahab bin Bakht were known to the Romans and
feared by them. The Romans suffered great losses at the hands of the
Muslims and failed to achieve any major victory against them.
Abdullah bin Oqba's feats in Spain were sufficient to keep the
European Christians and the Christian kings fearful at the mention of

i

I

the name of the Muslims. Peace was also restored in the Hijaz and
Yemen.

Zaid bin Ali
The treatment that was meted out to Husain bin Ali bin Abi Talib .;,.
at Karbala and to Abdullah bin Zubair ~ in Makkah by the
government of the Banu Umayyah and after that the policy that was
adopted by Hajjaj and Ibn Zeyad in the Hijaz and Iraq, all combined
to terrify and silence the Arab tribes of the Hijaz and Iraq. Moreover,
their acquisition and use of wealth created such a negative impression
on the masses that it gave rise to ill feelings ultimately leading to the
gradual disappearance of sincerity and sympathy for Banu Umayyah.
Hisham's 20-year rule was outwardly an age of peace. In his time,
there were no tyrants like Hajjaj and Ibn Zeyad in Iraq and the Hijaz.
Banu Hashim were repeatedly reminded of their own ruin and Banu
Umayyah's successes. They considered those who were not taking
extraordinary advantages of the government directly to be their
sympathizers. The fear and awe they had inspired also vanished. In
this atmosphere~ Banu Hashim made up their mind to pull down
Ba~m , Umayyah's government and establish their own. They had been
watching and gaining experience. Since the administrations of
Uthman bin Affan ~ and Ali bin Abi Talib ~, they felt that strategy
and planning was more effective than swords in changing
governments. Therefore, secret planning, conspfracies and subversive
activities were started on a large scale. The work was simultaneously
begun by two families of Banu Hashim. The descendents of Ali bin
Abi Talib and the descendents of Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib began
their struggles separately. The struggles made by the Abbasids will
follow later. At present mention is being made about the struggles of
the Alawites or Fatimids.
It has been mentioned above that Hisham bin Abdul Malik deputed
Yusuf bin Umar Thaqfi as the governor of Iraq. During his regime in
122 A.H. Zaid bin Ali bin Husain bin Ali bin Abi Talib began to take
the oath from the people secretly. As the popularity of Banu Umayyah
due to reasons mentioned above had declined so much, Zaid bin Ali
was highly successful in the matter of taking the oath and 15,000

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

229

people took the oath at his hands in Kufa.
Imam Abu Hanifa was one of the supporters of Zaid bin Ali. [Editor's
note: Imam Abu Hanifa is the founder of one'of the four schools of
Islamic jurisprudence that are universally accepted by Muslims.]
Those who watched and understood the past historical developments
advised Zaid bin Ali not to revolt but to wait for some time, he did not
act upon their counsel and he revolted in Kufa. Yusuf bin Umar
Thaqfi tried his best to put it down and the parties clashed. Just as the
Kufans had betrayed Husain bin Ali .:t,, and Musab bin Zubair,
similarly they betrayed Zaid bin Ali.
When the time for using swords and displaying valor came, they
started cross arguing like students. They said to him, "First tell us
what is your opinion about Abu Bakr Siddiq(= 11 <.S"".J) and Umar bin
Khattab ("---"' 11 ~X'? He said, "I never heard anyone in my family
calling them bad names" . They said, "The members of your family
were entitled to the caliphate and they did not feel offended at the
taking of the caliphate by these two (Abu Bakr and Umar r-P 11 <.S"".J),
and now Banu Umayyah instead of you has taken it, so how can you
call them unjustified and fight with them?" Having said so, they
annulled their oath and left. Zaid bin Ali called them Rafdees
"refusers". Only 220 persons were left with him. With that handful of
men, he faced several thousand fighters of Yusuf Thaqfi. He had
called at the house of each one of them to remind them of their oath
and solicited their support but none was forthcoming. Finally, after
defeating the Governor's army several times, he received an arrow on
the forehead and succumbed to the wound. Yusuf bin Umar Thaqfi
had his head cut off and sent to Hisham bin Abdul Malik in
Damascus. Zaid bin Ali's son Yahya bin Zaid left for Nainwa (situated
on the east bank of the Tigris opposite Mosil in Iraq) after his father's
death and remained in hiding there and then finding an opportunity
went to Khorasan.
Zaid bin Ali's attempt ended in failure due to his haste and lack of
foresight . But the Abbasids did not lag behind in taking advantage of
it and they learnt the lesson of being more careful and foresighted in
the matter and they were able to take a more correct estimation of the

230

The History of Islam

influence of Banu Umayyah in the country. Zaid bin Ali's death did
even more to induce and predispose the people to sympathize with
Banu Hashim because Hisham bin Abdul Malik had Zaid bin Ali' s
head hung on the entry gate to Damascus. Yusuf Thaqfi in Kufa, hung
up the dead bodies of Zaid bin Ali's comrades, which continued to
dangle there for years making the people hate Banu Umayyah and
sympathize with Banu Hashim even more.

The Conspiracy of the Abbasids
The caliphs of Banu Umayyah like Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik
venerated and entertained Abu Hashim Abdullah bin Mohammad bin
Hanfia bin Ali bin Abi Talib. However, he too was prejudiced against
Banu Umayyah because of his being a Hashimite and he wanted to
ruin Banu Umayyah's rule and bring Banu Hashim into power. His
efforts were confined to his followers and friends whom he confided
in if he found them capable. Such people were available to him in
abundance and they were found both in Iraq, Khorasan and the Hijaz.
Mohammad bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib also
was busy thinking how to dethrone Banu Umayyah and establish the
caliphate of Banu Abbas. During Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik's rule,
Abu Hashim Abdullah bin Mohammad went to Sulaiman bin Abdul
Malik in Damascus. On his return "journey, he stayed with
Mohammad bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas in Balqa (west-central
Jordan). By chance, he fell ill and died there. On his deathbed, he
asked him to try to take the Islamic caliphate. This was a form of
authorization and all those people who were Abu Hashim's followers
and confidants came and took the oath at Mohammad bin Ali' s hands
secretly. After that in 100 A.H. during Umar bin Abdul Aziz's
caliphate Mohammad bin Ali Abbasi sent his agents to the Islamic
countries like Iraq, Khorasan, Hijaz, Yemen, and Egypt. Though Umar
bin Abdul Aziz had reduced, to a great extent, the hatred and enmity,
most of the people harbored dislike in their hearts against Banu
Umayyah and Mohammad bin
Ali's movement remained
continuously active. On. his behalf, Maisarah in Iraq and Abu
Mohammad Sadiq in Khorasan continued suggesting to the people the
. benefits of an Abbasid caliphate. Mohammad bin Ali settled on the

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

231

outskirts of Balqa and from there, he made publicity for his movement
in the other Islamic countries. After a short time, he appointed 12
deputies and sent them to spread their message to all the Islamic
countries and they met with success everywhere.
In 102 A.H. or according to another narration in 104 A.H. Abu
Mohammad Sadiq, along with some influential persons of Khorasan
who agreed with his mission, came to Mohammad bin Ali. It was
during that time that Mohammad bin Ali came with his 15 day old
son and said to them, "This will be your chief". (That child later came
to be known as Abdullah Saffah and became the first Abbasid caliph).
Then Bukair bin Mahan who was in Sindh with Junaid, visited Kufa
and met Abu Mohammad Sadiq. He invited Bukair and he accepted at
once. These events occurred in 105 A.H. In 107 A.H. Bukair who was
the responsible officer in charge of the movement in Iraq and
Khorasan, sent Abu Ikrama, Abu Mohammad Sadiq, Mohammad
Khaneen, and Ammar Ebadi to Khorasan for advancing the cause of
the caliphate of the Abbasids, Asad Qasri was the Governor of
Khorasan at that time. He came to know by chance that some persons
were asking people to support the caliphate of the Abbasids. He had
all of them arrested and killed. Only Ammar managed to escape and
informed Bukair. Bukair sent the details to Mohammad bin Ali who
replied, "Thank Allah! Your missionary work and struggles have
proved successful and fruitful. Now you should await your own
death's too" . In 118 A.H., Bukair made Ammar bin Zaid the chief of
the supporters of Banu Abbas and sent him to Khorasan. He went
there and introduced himself as Kharash. He preferred sympathy with
Banu Abbas to even prayer and fasting and said to the people, "Far
superior to fasting and prayer is the struggle to establish the caliphate
of Banu Abbas and keep it a guarded secret and save it from
exposure". Hearing about these statements Mohammad bin Ali
expressed his displeasure with him. When the Governor of Khorasan,
Asad Qasri, became aware of Kharash' s activities, he had him arrested
and killed. Mohammad bin Ali was annoyed at the weak faith of the
Khorasanis. After which, an influential delegation from Khorasan
came to him and begged to be excused for their weakness.
Mo~ammad bin Ali made one of them his deputy and sent them back
to Khorasan. He gave them some wooden staffs, which symbolized

232

The History of Islam

power and authority. In 124 A.H., Mohammad bin Ali died in
captivity. He made his son Ibrahim his successor at the time of his
death and left a will for hi~ deputies and disciples to recognize
Ibrahim bin Mohammad bin Ali as their leader and obey him. Bukair
paid a visit to Ibrahim and received instructions from him, then set
out to Khorasan to communicate to the people there the news of
Mohammad bin Ali's death and the succession of his son as their
leader. Bukair reached Khorasan and after collecting the people of the
same mind, informed them of the situation and gave them
instructions. The supporters of Banu Abbas brought the little cash
they had and deposited it with him. Bukair went back to Imam
Ibrahim with the money and in 124 A.H., Ibrahim sent Abu Muslim to
Khorasan. The details about Abu Muslim and Imam Ibrahim and the
future situation of the movement will be narrated later on.
The state of Hisham bin Abdul Malik's caliphate has already been
narrated in brief. According to Yazid bin Abdul Malik's will, Waleed
bin Yazid was the heir-apparent after Hisham. However, Hisham
wanted to depose Waleed and make his own son his successor. The
noblemen and leaders of the government were not willing to accept it
and he did not succeed in his aim. The attempted dismissal of Waleed
created enmity between Hisham and Waleed . On 6 Rabi-al-Thani 125
A.H. after running the caliphate for nineteen and a half years Hisham
bin Abdul Malik died.

Waleed bin Yazid bin Abdul Malik
Abu! Abbas Waleed bin Yazid bin Abdul Malik bin Marwan bin Hakam
was born in 90 A.H. His mother was Hajjaj bin Yusuf Thaqfi's niece
and Mohammad bin Yusuf's daughter. He was quite young at the
time of Yazid bin Abdul Malik' s death. From the beginning of his
adulthood, his conduct was not good. He was notorious for his
indulgence in sin, immorality and debauchery. This was the main
reason. of Hisham' s intention of deposing him, which was justified.
However, the opposition of short sighted noblemen and leaders did not
allow him to succeed in his intention and Waleed bin Yazid succeeded
Hisham bin Abdul Malik. Waleed bin Yazid's regime marked the
opening of the door of ruin for the caliphate of Banu Umayyah.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

233

Immediately after accession to the throne Waleed bin Yazid began to
take revenge on his opponents. Some lost their salaries, some were
thrown into jail and some were killed. Sulaiman bin Hisham caught
hold of his brother and had him lashed and his beard shaved off and
publicly exposed. He made several of Yazid bin Hisham's and Waleed
bin Abdul Malik's sons captives. In brief, with his succession the first
thing he did was to turn his entire family into his enemies. Then he
arrested the Governor of Madinah Hisham bin Ismail Makhzumi' s
sons and the ex-Governor of Iraq, Khalid bin Abdullah Qasri and
handed them over to Yusuf bin Umar, the Governor of Iraq, who
tortured those noblemen to death.
In the first year 125 A.H., of Waleed bin Yazid's caliphate he took the
oath from the people for his sons Uthman and Hakam. Though the
practice of taking the oath for the heir apparent had been in practice
for many years and the people had become accustomed to this form of
oath, no one took the oath for those boys willingly and it left much
resentment in the hearts of the people.
Waleed refused to keep his misdeeds to himself he offended the
people with openly drinking and he made public his wrong beliefs
and thoughts. He not only drank wine but he committed adultery. All
these things discouraged the Governors of the provinces and
territories very much. Whoever took the oath of obedience did it out
of fear. Real support and sympathy vanished from the hearts of all.
In the very first year of his caliphate 125 A.H., he brought Khorasan
under Iraq and dismissed the Governor of Khorasan Nasr bin Sayyar.
Nasr received from Waleed bin Yazid as well as from Yusuf bin Umar,
the Governor of Iraq, the orders of his dismissal asking him further
to go to the capital, Damascus, at once and present the accounts of
the province.

Division of Provinces During Banu Umayyah's Regime
At this point, it is essential to understand how the caliphate of Banu
Umayyah divided all the Islamic territory into administrative
provinces. One Amir or deputy of the State was appointed for each
province. He enjoyed absolute royal power in his province and
appointed his own Governors in the states of his province. There were

)!

234

The History of Islam

large provinces like Hijaz, Iraq, Jazirah, Armenia, Syria, Egypt, North
Africa, Andalusia (Spain) and Khorasan. The Hijaz included Makkah,
Madinah, Taif and Yemen. Sometimes Yemen was taken from under
the Hijaz' s control and considered a separate province and its
governor was appointed by the caliph. Syria included Jordan, Hims,
Damascus and Qansareen. North Africa sometimes was included with
Egypt and sometimes it was separated from Egypt and considered as
an independent province and the Governor for Qairwan (North
Africa) was appointed by the court of the caliph.
Similarly sometimes Spain was separated and its Governor was
appointed by the Caliph himself and sometimes it was brought under
the Amir of Qairwan and included in the province of North Africa. In
that case, the Amir of Qairwan used to appoint the Governor in Spain
by his own authority. The same was the case with Iraq and Khorasan,
that is, Khorasan was sometimes segregated as a Province and its
Governor or Amir was appointed by the caliph and sometimes it was
annexed to the province of Iraq. In that case, the ruler of Khorasan
was appointed by the Governor of Iraq. The Amirs in the provinces
and governors in their states had absolute power. However,
sometimes the Revenue Officers responsible for collecting the taxes
were appointed by the caliph independently. Officers appointed in
this way were not considered to be working under the ruler of the
Province or state. However, the head of the armed forces of the
Province and the one responsible for the maintenance of law and
order was always the Amir of the Province or the governor of the
state concerned. As in the case of the Revenue Officers sometimes,
even the magistrate or head judge was sent by the caliph's court but
the leader of the prayer was always the Amir or the governor. The
leadership and military head were inter-related . Later on, the
leadership of the prayers and governorship of the Provinces were
segregated although the sermon of the Friday prayer remained the
prerogative of the Amir or governor of the Province or state who was
also the military Commander.
When Nasr bin Sayyar received the order of his dismissal, he first
intended to obey it but then decided not to leave Khorasan and he
proclaimed his independence.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

235

In order to maintain the chain of events one incident must be
mentioned here. Before Nasr had received the orders of his dismissal
and when he still recognized the caliphate of Waleed bin Yazid, he
received the order that he should arrest and send Yahya bin Zaid bin
Ali bin Husain bin Ali bin Abi Talib to Damascus. Yahya bin Zaid was
staying in Balkh following his father's death. Nasr had Yahya bin Zaid
imprisoned. Waleed bin Yazid ordered that Nasr should send Yahya
to him. Nasr released Yahya and ordered him to go to the Caliph in
Damascus. Yahya left but turned back and returned to Khorasan. A
large number of his followers rallied round him. Nasr sent an army to
fight against them and Yahya was hit by an arrow in the forehead and
died from the injury just like his father and all his comrades were
slain. This happened at Jurjan in 125 A.H. Yahya's head was sent to
Waleed and his dead body was hung on a cross, which remained there
for seven years. It was Abu Muslim Khorasani who later took it down.
Not only had the atrocities Waleed bin Yazid perpetrated on the
people already incensed them but also his cousins whom he had
tyrannized began to move against him. His cousin Yazid bin Waleed
bin Abdul Malik in particular worked against him. Yazid bin Waleed
was considered to be one of the very gentle and pious members of
Waleed bin Yazid's dynasty. He therefore began to expose the caliph's
unlawful activities and very soon, many came to agree with him. On
his mission, he received the support not only of the leaders of the
army and the Amirs of the Provinces but also of the family of the
Caliph. The result was that all took the oath at Yazid bin Waleed's
hands secretly and thus the larger part of the Syrian army joined him.
He left Damascus and stayed at at a village a little distance from
Damascus and from there he sent his agents to all the Islamic
territories to inform them of the misdeeds and sinful acts of Waleed
bin Yazid and mobilize their opinion against Waleed bin Yazid and
for Yazid bin Waleed. This was the first time that Banu Umayyah and
the royal family were disunited and split up, the opposition grew so
strong that secret conspiracies and deceit were resorted to.
Consequently, the condition of Waleed's authority deteriorated and
Yazid's authority was enhanced. Yazid bin Waleed's brother Abbas
bin Waleed, disapproved of what Yazid was doing and wanted to
stop his brother from rebelling. It was due to his opposition that
compelled Yazid to leave Damascus and seek another place to live at.

236

The History of Islam

Yazid was satisfied about his position in all respects and fixed Friday
27 Jamad-al-Thani 126 A.H. for the uprising. He entered Damascus
after the night prayer and arrested the city magistrate and then
captured the government arsenal. Waleed did not have any prior
information about the rebellion and its preparations. When he realized
what was transpiring he became nervous and confused and could do
nothing. He sat down and closed the doors of the palace. The
inhabitants and people living in the adjoining areas began to arrive
and take the oath from Yazid bin Waleed openly. Waleed wanted to
leave Damascus and go to Hims but Yazid besieged Waleed in the
palace of Noman. Waleed's comrades fought desperately. Abbas bin
Waleed, Yazid's brother, left Damascus with a group of warriors to
support Waleed and,,oppose Yazid but Mansoor bin Jamhoor arrested
him on the way and presented him before Yazid bin Waleed. When
Waleed bin Yazid realized there was no way out, he said. "This is the
same type of day that befell Uthman bin Affan (.w- .iii.,?;)'' and then
he sat down to read the Qur'an. Yazid's men scaled over the palace
walls, entered it and cut off his head. Mansoor bin Jamhoor took it to
Yazid bin Waleed. Yazid said, "Let it be displayed in public and then
sent to his brother Sulaiman bin Yazid" and it was done accordingly.
Waleed, after being caliph for a year and three months, was killed on
28 Jamad-al-Thani 126 A.H. and the same day Yazid bin Wal eed bin
Abdul Malik acceded to the throne. The suffering caused by this civil
war among the Banu Umayyah continued to bring about misfortunes
and ultimately lead to its extermination .

Yazid bin Waleed bin Abdul Malik
Abu Khalid Yazid bin Waleed bin Abdul Malik bin Marwan bin
Hakam is also known as Yazid the III and 'Yazid Naqis' (Yazid the
reducer) . He was called by this name because he slashed the salaries
of the army. When Waleed bin Yazid had taken over as Caliph, he had
increased the salaries by ten 'dirhams'. When Yazid became Caliph, he
abolished the increment and restored the previous pay scale that was
used by caliph Hisham. After becoming Caliph, Yazid gathered the
people and said, "Waleed was a disbeliever and therefore he was
assassinated. Now I shall treat you well. You will get your salaries on
time. No one will be given any land until I fortify the borders of the

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

237

Islamic territories and fill the cities with justice and righteousness. I
shall not keep watch at my door so that everyone may have easy
access to me". After that, he took the oath for his brother Ibrahim
bin Waleed and Abdul Aziz bin Hajjaj bin Abdul Malik to succeed
after him.
When the inhabitants of Hims learned that Waleed bin Yazid was
assassinated, they took up arms and made Yazid bin Khalid bin Yazid
bin Muawiya their leader and set out for Damascus to avenge
Waleed's death. Yazid bin Waleed gave an army to Sulaiman bin
Hisham bin Abdul Malik for defense. He first made a proposal for
reconciliation to the inhabitants of Hims and when they refused, he
began to fight them. The consequence was.that Yazid bin Khalid was
caught and the rebels of Hims were killed in large numbers and the
rest ran away from the battlefield.
When the Palestinians received the news, they also revolted. They
made Yazid bin Sulaiman bin Abdul Malik their leader and when the
Jordanians heard, they enthroned Mohammad bin Abdul Malik as
their king and joined the Palestinians. The forces of the Palestinians
and Jordanians moved jointly to Damascus. Waleed had already won
the people of those places to his side but since it was an issue of the
Caliph's assassination, they were enveloped by a strong wave of
sympathy for the murdered Caliph and hatred against the present
one. This was not surprising when we see a criminal executed
although he is guilty our previous hatred and loathing for him
dissipates. The office of the caliph is a cherished one and any foul play
connected to it brings a negative reaction and because of these factors
the Jordanians and Palestinians revolted. Hearing about the
advancing army, Yazid deputed Sulaiman bin Hi.sham with a large
army to discipline and correct them. Sulaiman defeated them all and
forced them to obey Lhe nc , -diph.
After suppressing these revolts in Syria, Yazid dismissed Yusuf bin
Umar as the Amir of Iraq and Khorasan and replaced him with
Mansoor bin Jamhoor. Yusuf did not officially hand over the authority
to him instead he left for Damascus covertly. As soon as he arrived in
Damascus, Yazid bin Waleed arrested him and he died in captivity.
Mansoor reached Kufa and released all the prisoners Yusuf had jailed

238

The History of Islam

and sent his own brother as the Governor of Khorasan. Nasr bin
Sayyar did not allow him entry into Khorasan and before the issue
was settled, Yazid bin Waleed dismissed Mansoor and replaced him
by Abdullah bin Umar bin Abdul Aziz and sent him to Iraq, not even
two months had elapsed between the appointment of Mansoor and his
replacement by Abdullah. Mansoo r officially handed over the
responsibilities of Amir to Abdullah and went to Syria . Abdullah bin
Umar appointed Nasr bin Sayyar governor of Khorasan. At that time,
the state of Yamamah was governed along with the province of Iraq.
Sometimes Yamamah was annexed to the Hijaz and at other times to
Iraq. The inhabitants of Yamamah had proclaimed their independence
during Yusuf bin Umar's regime by expelling Ali bin Muhajir, the
Governor of Yamamah. They were still independent and nothing
could be done to bring them under the central government's rule.
When Abdullah bin Umar bin Abdul Aziz took over as the Amir of
Iraq and appointed Nasr bin Sayyar the Governor of Khorasan, Jadi
bin Kermani Azdi revolted against him. Jadi was in fact an Azdi but
because he was born in Kerman, he was known as Kermani. Because
Nasr had declared his independence as ruler of Khorasan and then
was appointed to the post of Governor he seemingly was rewarded
for his rebellion, so Jadi felt resentment. He said to his friends, "They
are falling into mischief. Choose your own leader for your work".
Nasr bin Sayyar and Kermani had disagreed in the past and there was
resentment still lingering between them. For starting this new
problem, Nasr arrested him and put him into jail on 27 Ramadan 126
A.H. Kermani remained there for a few days and then managed to
escape. He was able to immediately gathered 3000 men. Nasr
appointed a military commander to humble and discipline him.
However, the people intervened and stopped the fight and brought
about reconciliation between them. That resulted in Kermani visiting
Nasr who exhorted him to remain confined to his house. After a few
days, Kermani wanted to revolt again. Several times they were ready
to fight and then became reconciled. Finally, it was agreed that
Kerrnani should leave Khorasan and go to Jurjan.
During the days when Nasr and Kermani were constantly disputing
the situation turned very dangerous, Nasr had the apprehension that
Kerrnani might call Harith bin Shuraih from Turkistan and strengthen

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

239

himself. Harith bin Shuraih has already been mentioned. He had been
in Turkistan for 12 or 13 years. Therefore, Nasr sent Muqatil bin
Hayani Nabti to bring Harith to him. He sent letters to Abdullah bin
Umar bin Abdul Aziz in Kufa and to Yazid bin Waleed in Damascus
expressing his opinion of the possible danger from Harith and
requested for documents of safe passage and permission to call him to
Khorasan. Letters guaranteeing his security came from both the
places. Harith left Turkistan and arrived in Khorasan where Nasr
entertained him splendidly and lodged him at Marwrood. He fixed 50
dirhams as his daily allowance and said to him, "Choose the state and
you will be made the Governor there". Harith said, "I don't want
material benefits or power. I am interested in bringing into practice
the Book and the Sunnah (practical application of the Quran and the
methods of the Prophet !i). I became sick of atrocities and I left these
cities now after 13 years you have recalled me to them". Nasr was
silent upon hearing this. Harith then sent word to Kermani, "If Nasr
bin Sayyar is acting upon the Book and the Sunnah I shall fight
against his enemies and support him and if he fails to act
accordingly, I shall join you provided that you too promise to act
upon the Book and Sunnah". Then Harith drew the tribe of Tamim
and others to his command and within a few days, 3,000 people took
the oath for his leadership.
This was the situation in Khorasan. In Armenia, Marwan bin
Mohammad bin Marwan and in Jazira, Abduh bin Riyah Ghassani
were the Amirs. When Waleed bin Yazid was killed, Abdu Ghassani
left Jazirah (Literally: island. The region lies between the Euphrates
and Tigris rivers and is bounded on the south by a line running
between Takrit and Anbar. It is the northern reaches of Mesopotamia,
now making up part of northern Iraq and extending into eastern
Turkey and extreme northeastern Syria) and went to Syria. Marwan
bin Mohammad's son, Abdul Malik, finding the province of Jazirah
deserted, captured it and then sent his agents to various places and
wrote to his father, Marwan bin Mohammad bin Marwan, "This is a
big opportunity please stand up and avenge Waleed's death" . Yazid
bin Waleed had hardly become free from the uprisings in Hims,
Jordan and Palestine, when he received the news of Marwan's revolt.
Because the situation was highly critical for Yazid he wrote to

240

The History of Islam

Marwan, "If you take the oath at my hands I shall give you the
authority over all the states of Jazirah, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Mosil
and send you the certificate making you the Amir". Marwan bin
Mohammad took the oath from Yazid, and as promised, Yazid sent
him the documents making him the Amir. Marwan then began to rule
over the Provinces mentioned, previously he was the ruler of Armenia
alone but now he was made the Amir of all territories up to Mosil.
Yazid bin Waleed, popularly known as Yazid Naqis (the reducer) was
not bad from the view point of his morals and merits but he did not
live long and after ruling for about six months, he died of plague on
20 Dhul Hijja 126 A.H. at the age of 35.

Ibrahim bin Waleed bin Abdul Malik
Abu lshaq Ibrahim bin Waleed bin Abdul Malik took over as caliph
after his brother Yazid Naqis in keeping with his will. All the people
did not take the oath from Ibrahim. Some continued refusing to do so.
When Marwan bin Mohammad bin Marwan, the Amir of Armenia,
heard of Yazid's death, he advanced towards Damascus with his
army. First, he arrived at Qansareen (one of the five original provinces
that the conquering Arabs divided greater Syria into, now northern
Syria). After capturing it, he moved towards Hims. The situation in
Hims was strange. The inhabitants of Hims had not taken the oath
with Ibrahim. Because of this the Syrian army from Damascus under
the command of Abdul Aziz bin Hajjaj bin Abdul Malik, the
commander of Ibrahim, was besieging Hims. When Abdul Aziz heard
Marwan bin Mohammad was approaching, he raised the siege and
went to Damascus. When Marwan arrived in Hims, the inhabitants of
Hims took the oath without any hesitation. When Ibrahim was
informed of it, he sent Sulaiman bin Hisham with an army of 120,000
to fight with Marwan. Marwan had 80,000 soldiers only. Before the
fight, Marwan sent the message that read, "We give up our claim to
Waleed binYazid's blood. Simply release his sons Hakam and Uthman
whom Waleed had made his heirs apparent". Sulaiman bin Hisham
turned down the request and the battle began. Sulaiman suffered a
crushing defeat after getting his 17,000 men killed. Marwan took the
oath for Hakam and Uthman and moved towards Damascus. In

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

241

Damascus Ibrahim and his advisors agreed to murder Hakam and
Uthman and that is how they did. Marwan entered Damascus as the
victor and Ibrahim and Sulaiman fled from Damascus towards
Tadmur (ancient Syrian city, now in south-central Syria). Marwan
found 'the dead bodies of Hakam and Uthman and was extremely
aggrieved. He performed the funeral prayer and buried them and
then put the question to the people, "Whom do you want to be made
your Caliph"? They all unanimously took the oath with Marwan bin
Mohammad bin Marwan bin Hakam. That occurred on Monday 24
Safar 127 A.J--1. Marwan granted pardon to Ibrahim and the latter
willingly renounced his claim to the caliphate in favor of Marwan bin
Muhammad. Historians differ on Ibrahim's caliphate. Some consider
him to be a caliph and some do not because his caliphate was not
recognized all over the Islamic world and he also abdicated. His
caliphate whatever it may be considered lasted for only two months
and a few days.

Marwan bin Mohammad bin Marwan bin Hakam
Marwan bin Mohammad is the last of the caliphs of the Banu
Umayyah dynasty. Historically he is sometimes referred to as Marwan
IL The caliph was known for his patience because the days of his
caliphate were passed in waging many battles and he proved himself
very forbearing and enduring. Marwan bin Mohammad lived at
Harran instead of Damascus. He invited (the deposed caliph) Ibrahim
from Tadmur and fixed him a salary. On 1 Shawwal Marwan received
news that the inhabitants of Hims were fully prepared to take arms
and that the Arab tribes from the adjoining areas had joined them. As
soon as he heard the news, he took his forces and rushed towards
Hims. Ibrahim and Sulaiman also accompanied him. They reached
Hims on 30 Shawwal. They found the city gates closed . Marwan's
officer shouted, "Why have you broken your oath with the ' Amir alMuminin?" The city dwellers said, "We have not broken it. We are
obedient and still firm on the oath". Then they opened the city gates
and Marwan's men entered it. There were several factions in Hims,
those opposed to him fought with Marwan and he defeated them. He
pulled down about 300 yards of the city wall and leveled it to avoid
another siege. He took the oath from the citizens. He was still in the

242

The History of Islam

city when he received news that the citizens of Ghota had chosen
Yazid bin Khalid as their leader, invaded Damascus and besieged its
Governor. Marwan sent 10,000 soldiers to the help the Governor. The
army arrived and the fight between them began. Marwan's army
fought from outside and the people of Damascus fought from within.
The Ghota people were defeated. Yazid bin Khalid was killed and his
head was cut off and sent to Marwan. Immediately after the
suppression of the uprising Thabit bin Nairn gathered the Palestinians
and laid siege to Tabria. It was then ruled over by Waleed bin
Muawiya bin Marwan bin Hakam. Marwan at once sent his
commander Abu! Warda to put down the rebellion. Immediately after
his arrival, the Taberians came out of the city and fought. The
Palestinians were defeated . Abu! Warda caught Thabit bin Naim's
three sons and sent them to Marwan. Marwan appointed Ramahis bin
Abdul Aziz Kanani as the ruler of Palestine. He searched for and
arrested Thabit bin Nairn and sent him to Marwan who chopped off
his and his son's hands and feet and crucified them. After these
events, the situation stabilized and Marwan bin Mohammad took the
oath for the succession of his sons Abdullah and Obaidullah at Dair
Ayyub and they married Hisham bin Abdul Malik's daughters. Then
he invaded Tadrnur because they were still claiming independence.
They were forced to surrender and take the oath. Then he sent Yazid
bin Umar bin Hubairah to Iraq to expel Dhahak Shebani Khawarji
who had occupied Kufa. He stayed at Qarqisa in order to keep
sending reinforcements from the rear. Before this, Sulaiman bin
Hisham had encamped at RuSaffah (near present day Baghdad) to
take rest. A large number of Syrians whom Marwan had sent to Iraq
under the command of Yazid bin Umar bin Hubaira left him and went
to Sulaiman bin Hisham and requested him to accept the caliphate.
Sulaiman accepted it and taking them with him moved towards
Qansareen. From there, he wrote letters to the different Syrian groups
to which they responded and Syrians from all directions rallied round
him and formed a big army. When Marwan heard about it, he ordered
Yazid bin Umar bin Hubaira to halt and then he himself left Qarqisa
and moved to face Sulaiman . Marwan and Sulaiman arrayed their
forces outside of Qansareen at Hanaf and Marwan's forces defeated
Sulaiman and forced him to escape. The captives from Sulaiman's
men were slain. Sulaiman bin Hisham's son and Hisham bin Abdul

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

243

Malik's maternal uncle Khalid bin Hisham Makhzumi were killed on
the battlefield . Sulaiman fl ed to Hims, gathered more armed forces
and repaired the city walls. Marwan arrived at Hims and there was a
fierce battle. Marwan surrounded Hims and continued the siege for
about six months. Eighty catapults constantly kept launching stones.
Becoming helpless, the citizens of Hims begged for pardon and
Sulaiman escaped to Tadmur. Finishing the siege of Hims, Marwan
set out for Kufa to fight with Dhahak Khawarji .
Yazid bin Umar bin Hubaira went to Kufa and defeated Dhahak
Khwarji. Dhahak reordered his army and Yazid bin Umar defeated
him again and entered Kufa. The Khawarij rebelled several times but
they were defeated each time. Yazid bin Umar bin Hubaira occupied
Iraq and sent Nasr bin Sayyar to Khorasan as the Govern or after he
took the oath for Marwan bin Mohammad.
As mentioned above, Harith bin Shuraih was present in Khorasan and
the number of his men kept increasing day by day. He knew that he
was granted pardon and security by Yazid bin Waleed and not by
Marwan bin Mohammad. The Governor of Kufa, Abdullah bin Umar
bin Abdul Aziz had also granted him pardon but not the present
Governor of Kufa, Yazid bin Umar bin Hubairah. Therefore, Harith
announced his opposition to them. Nasr bin Sayyar argued with him
on this point very much but he did not see reason. Finally, war
became inevitable. The flames of war engulfed the streets of the
capital city Merv. From the other side of Khorasan, Kermani in
Kerman had become very powerful. Nasr bin Sayyar sent for Kermani
with grave misgivings because his doubts about his loyalty were not
clarified. Kermani prepared himself for opposition to both sides. In
short, the three of them, Kermani, Harith and Nasr assembled at Merv
with their armies. All of them were equally powerful and all of them
had different goals in their hearts. None of them had sympathy for
the other. At last, Harith and Kermani joined together and defeated
Nasr and expelled him from Merv. After a few days, they fought with
each other, which resulted in the death of Harith and Kermani
captured Merv in 128 A.H. When Harith was killed, Nasr collected
Harith's soldiers and started sending armies against Kermani. Battles
were waged and in almost all the confrontations, Nasr' s commanders

244

The History of Islam

were defeated. At last, Nasr, taking a big army, went to Merv. The
two sides made fortifications and a chain of battles began. The battles
continued and neither side was able to subdue the other. Abu Muslim
Khorasani, who finds mention in the coming pages, found the
situation advantageous and collected an army, he entered into
correspondence with Nasr and Kermani separately. He wrote to Nasr,
"Imam Ibrahim (the leader of the Abbasid movement) has sent me
some instructions about you and I think you will be benefited by
them". Then he wrote the same type of letter to Kermani, "I am your
sympathizer and Imam Ibrahim has written to me to help you in your
time of need". He gave instructions to the messengers bearing the
letters to show the letter addressed to Nasr, to those tribes which
sympathized with him, and to show the letter, addressed to Kermani
to those tribes who were Kermani's sympathizers. The aim was to win
the sympathy of all the tribes. Similarly, he managed to gain the
sympathy and support of the Khawarij by clever means. Abu Muslim
Khorasani arrived with his army and encamped in between the
fortifications of Kermani and Nasr. Both sides failed to guess whom
he would support or oppose. The next day Abu Muslim sent word to
Kermani, "I shall fight with Nasr from your side". Kermani was
highly pleased. When Nasr came to know about it he wrote to
Kermani, "Abu Muslim wants to harm you cleverly . Don't come into
his snare. We should forget our differences and fight against him".
Kermani agreed to Nasr's suggestion. The next day a meeting between
the two was arranged. Kermani came out with 200 men to meet Nasr
whose men taking the opportunity killed them. Kermani' s son Ali
came running to Abu Muslim for support and Kermani's and Abu
Muslim's armies under the command of Ali and Abu Muslim attacked
Nasr. Nasr was defeated. He fled and hid himself in a house. Abu
Muslim and Ali captured Merv. Ali bin Kermani wanted to take the
oath at Abu Muslim's hand but the latter said," At present maintain
the status quo. We shall do whatever is proper when the Imam's order
comes". Nasr escaped from Merv and began to gather forces. Abu
Muslim and Ali bin Kermani lived together. Abu Muslim persuaded
the chief of the Khawarij Shehan bin Abdul Aziz Khwarji to join him
because Nasr was inimical to the Khawarij. Ali bin Kermani joined
Abu Muslim because he wanted to avenge his father's dea th. Nasr

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

245

sent word to the Khawarij leader in order separate him and Abu
Muslim, saying that Abu Muslim was a Shiite. In brief, the Khawarij
split with Abu Muslim, Kermani's son also left him. All these four
groups, Abu Muslim, Sheban Khawariji, Ali bin Kermani and Nasr
were wandering here and there in Khorasan all looking for an
opportunity against the other. Nasr and Abu Muslim were more
clever and more farsighted than the others. Consequently, Abu
Muslim had an opportunity and murdered Sheban Khawariji and
Kermani's son one after the other in 130 A.H. In 131 A.H., Nasr fell ill
and died at Rayy and that left Abu Muslim with no rivals remaining
in Khorasan.

Khawarij
A brief of the situation in Khorasan has been given above. We will
now discuss the Khawarij factor . They observed the civil wars and
weaknesses in [slamic territories and used these situations to assist
them in their revolt. The Khawarij of Khorasan chose Dhahak bin Qais
Shebani as their leader. Dhahak attacked Kufa and occupied it and
Abdullah bin Umar bin Abdul Aziz had to retreat from Kufa and go
to Wasit. Sulaiman bin Hisham, defeated by Marwan bin Mohammad,
joined Dhahak bin Qais. That of course added to Dhahak's overall
strength. Dhahak
then invaded Mosil. There Marwan bin
Mohammad's son, Abdullah bin Marwan, faced him with only 7000
soldiers while Dhahak had one hundred thousand fighters, and with
this army he surrounded Abdullah bin Marwan. Marwan, Abdullah's
father received this information and turned his attention to his son's
predicament. After a fierce battle, Dhahak was killed and the
Khawarij chose Sayeed bin Bahdal as their leader but he was also
killed. Then they made Sheban bin Abdul Aziz their new leader.
Marwan sent Yazid bin Hubaira towards Kufa. He went there and
turned out all the Khawarij from that city. On the other side, Sheban
bin Abdul Aziz, taking all the Khawarij with him, went towards Iran.
There he joined Abu Muslim as has been mentioned above and was
killed in 130 A.H. The Hijaz, Yemen and Hadramawt (ancient South
Arabian kingdom that occupied what are now southern and
southeastern Yemen and part of the present-day Sultanate of Oman)
also saw rebellions and Abu Hamza Mukhtar bin Auf Azdi raised the

246

The History of Islam

flag of rebellion and Abdullah bin Yahya, the ruler of Hadramawt
joined him. Abu Hamza first captured Madinah and then moved
towards Syria. Marwan bin Mohammad deputied Ibn Atya Sadi to
confront him and they met at Wadi Qura. Abu Hamza was killed in
the battle. Ibn Atya then proceeded to Yemen and confronted
Abdullah bin Yahya who was ready to face him a battle ensued and it
resulted in Abdullah bin Yahya's dealh. Ibn Atya cut off his head and
sent it to Marwan. At the time Marwan bin Mohammad was at war
with Dhahak Khwarji near Mosil, a letter written by Imam Ibrahim
and addressed to Abu Muslim Khorasani was intercepted and given
to Marwan. It contained instructions that included, "Don't spare even
a single Arab or a descendent of an Arab. The natives of Khorasan
who have embraced Islam will stand us in good stead. We should rely
on them more". The letter also revealed that Banu Abbas had spread
the net of conspiracy against Banu Umayyah for quite a long time and
Imam Ibrahim whose center of operations was at Hamima in Balqa
was the engineer of these plots.
Marwan bin Mohammad after reading the letter ordered his ruler in
Balqa to arrest Imam Ibrahim and send him to the caliph. So, Imam
Ibrahim bin Mohammad along with several members of his family
was caught and sent to caliph Marwan as captives. They were put in
jail at Harran. Along with Imam Ibrahim Sayeed bin Hisham bin
Abdul Malik and his two sons, Uthman and Marwan, Abbas bin
Waleed bin Abdul Malik, Abdullah bin Umar bin Abdul Aziz and
Abu Muhammad Sufyani were also imprisoned. In a matter of days
an epidemic broke out in Harran and Imam Ibrahim, Abbas bin Waleed
and Abdullah bin Umar bin Abdul Aziz died from the disease.
Sayeed bin Hisham along with the other prisoners killed the jailer,
broke open lhe jail door and escaped. The inhabitants of Harran
caught the escaping prisoners and killed them. Abu Mohammad
Sufyani did not escape from jail with the others. He was released by
Marwan bin Mohammad after he returned defeated from Zab river
battle. Imam Ibrahim left his will at the time of his arrest and
imprisonment that after his death his brother Abdullah bin
Mohammad, popularly known as Abu! Abbas Saffah would be his
successor. He also willed that Abu! Abbas Saffah should not stay in

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

247

Balqa but in Kufa. Imam Ibrahim, before his arrest, had directed that
Abu Muslim Khorasani should be as their officer to comply with this
order and then Imam Ibrahim sent Qahtaba bin Shabeeb to Abu
Muslim with a black flag to revolt and capture Khorasan. Abdullah
bin Mohammad Saffah along with his family settled in Kufa in
accordance with the will of his brother.
Abu Muslim brought under his control the whole of Khorasan
between 130 A.H. and 131 A.H. Then he sent Qahtaba bin Shabeeb
with an army towards Kufa. Kufa was captured and then the oath at
the hand of Abul Abbas Saffah Abdullah bin Mohammad followed .
Upon receiving this news Marwan bin Mohammad left Harran with
120,000 warriors and marched towards Kufa. The confrontation
between his army and Saffah' s army under the command of his uncle
Abdullah bin Ali took place adjacent to the Zab River. If Marwan bin
Mohammad' s army had · the desire to fight, it could have easily
defeated Abu! Abbas Saffah's army. However in the midst of the
battle at the point that Marwan had forced the greater portion of
Abdullah bin Ali's army into retreat and there was no doubt left that
Marwan would be victorious, the greater portion of Marwan's army
refused to attack and continue the fight as if their purpose was to
cause his defeat.
Abdullah bin Ali, finding himself on the verge of defeat and deciding
to risk everything, attacked with a selected group of men. None of
Marwan's leaders came forward to meet this last desperate challenge.
Marwan tempted them with rewards and special favors but without
response. Then he poured all his treasure on to the battlefield and told
them to attack and after killing the weakened enemies, they could
distribute it among themselves. The army failed to follow his orders
and became engrossed in looting the exposed valuables and even
those few who were still fighting left the battle and also began looting.
Shocked at this disorder and chaos Marwan sent his son, Abdullah to
stop the looting. As soon he reached where they were looting the
treasure, they began to flee and left Marwan with only a few persons.
Marwan was disillusioned with the disloyalty and disobedience of his
army and escaped . He arrived in Mousil where the people taunted
him for his defeat. He realized the futility of staying there and went to

248

The History of Islam

Harran where his nephew Abbas bin Yazid bin Mohammad was the
Governor. Marwan was defeated on Saturday 11 Jamad-al-Thani 132
A.H. along side of the Zab River. He had stayed at Harran for 20 days
when he heard of Abdullah bin Ali's approach and he immediately
left for Hims. When Abdullah bin Ali reached Harran, its Governor
Abbas came out in black clothes and holding a black flag to receive
him and took the oath for Saffah's caliphate at his hands. Abdullah bin
Ali granted him pardon. When Marwan reached Hims, the citizens at
first showed their obedience and respect but when they realized his
military weakness, they prepared to revolt and fight him. Marwan left
Hims after three days. The citizens of Hims wanted to rob him of his
valuables. Marwan first tried to argue with them and make them see
reason but they did not give up their attempts to overpower him and
he fought with them and made them withdraw.
From Hims Marwan went to Damascus. Its governor was his cousin
Waleed bin Muawiya bin Marwan bin Hakam. He did not stay there
he only induced the governor to fight against the opponents of Banu
Umayyah, he went to Palestine and stayed there hoping to lead a life
of silence and retirement.
In Harran Abdullah bin Ali, after pulling down the jail where Ibrahim
bin Mohammad had been in captivity, moved towards Damascus. On
the way his brother Abdus Samad bin Ali whom Saffah had sent to
help him with a body of 8000 soldiers, arrived. Then he, after taking
the oath from the people of Harran, went to Damascus via Qansareen
and Baibak and laid siege to it. After a short siege he entered
Damascus on Wednesday 5 Ramadan 132 A.H. by force and blood
flowed in its streets.
Its governor Waleed bin Muawiya was killed in the confrontation.
After the massacre and victory Abdullah bin Ali stayed there for 15
days and then went to Palestine. He had just arrived at the Palestine
border when he received a letter from Abdullah bin Saffah asking him
to send his brother Saleh bin Ali in pursuit of Marwan. Marwan left
Palestine and went to Arish (town in the northeastern section of the
Sinai Penins!fla), then to the Nile River and then to Said. Saleh
continued the pursuit and camped at Fustat (this was the earliest Arab
settlement in Egypt south of modern Cairo) from there he sent a

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

249

division of his army in search of Marwan. By chance, Saleh's soldiers
came across Marwan's cavalry.
Marwan's horsemen were already in low spirits and frustrated they
did not fight and fled away and a few of them were al.so captured.
When they were interrogated, they revealed Marwan's location,
informing them that he was at Boseer. The officer of Saleh's division
Abu Aun thought it best to launch a night attack on Marwan for he
knew that to face him would not be easy and they attacked as
planned. Surprised at the sudden attack, Marwan came out of his
house. A soldier was laying in wait for him attacked him with a spear.
He fell down and one of his men said, "The Amir al-Muminin is
dead." Hearing it Abu Aun and his men rushed to him and cut off his
head and sent it to Abul Abbas Abdullah Saffah .
This occurred on 28 Dhul Hijjah 132 A.H. corresponding to 5 August
750 AD and with it came to end the Caliphate of Banu Umayyah and
began the Caliphate of Banu Abbas. Following Marwan's death his
sons Abdullah and Obaidullah, fled to Ethiopia. The Africans did not
grant them safe passage and they killed Obaidullah and Abdullah
escaped to Palestine and began to live there in hiding. During the
Caliphate of Mahdi, the governor of Palestine arrested him and sent
him to the court of Mahdi and he put him into prison.

The Reign of Marwan bin Mohammad
Marwan bin Mohammad was the last caliph of Banu Umayyah. So, he
is generally regarded as the man responsible for the ruin of the
caliphate of Banu Umayyah. However, the real causes of its ruin were
created by his predecessor's negligence long before his caliphate. The
duration of Marwan's caliphate was slightly less than six years and he
never had a single day of peace during the entire period.
He spent the entire reign of his caliphate on horseback. His hard work,
bravery, and firmness can not be measured easily because he was
given a realm that suffered from an incurable disease. Had he acceded
to the throne earlier, he could have delayed the downfall of the
caliphate of Banu Umayyah for some time however, in his time he
failed to counteract the shortcomings of Banu Umayyah's government

250

The History of Islam

and Banu Abbas's conspiracies. Marwan was not a man of a high
mental caliber and wisdom to have been able to breathe new life into a
government that was struggling to survive. His whole life was spent
in disputes and battles. During his reign, only swords shined over the
Islamic World and no one had any rest. Nor was there time to make
Jihad against the infidels. During his reign, Muslim blood was spilled
on an unprecedented scale.
Marwan was born in 70 A.H . or 72 A.H. while his father Mohammad
bin Marwan was the governor of Jazirah. His mother was a slave from
Kurdistan. She was owned by Ibrahim Ushtar. Mohammad bin
Marwan took her in battle and it was from her that Marwan was born.

A Synopsis of Banu Umayyah's Caliphate
1- The internal feuds and secret conspiracies that started from the
second half of Uthman bin Affan's .l'_.;, caliphate ended with Amir
Mu'awiya ~ being recognized as the caliph and Banu Umayyah's
caliphate being founded . The greatest cause for the ruin of the
caliphate of Banu Umayyah and a stigma being attached to the world
of Islam began at the hands of the founder of the Banu Umayyah
dynasty, Amir Muawiya ~ making his son Yazid, the heir-apparent
established hereditary succession. The epidemic of succession started
in such a virulent form that the Muslims have not been able to rid
the1nselves of it until now. The consequence of his action was that the
just and beneficial social equality that was established by Islam was
destroyed and it was replaced by family rule, which has always been a
curse for mankind. Among the Banu Umayyah dynasty Amir
Muawiya ~, Abdul Malik bin Marwan and Waleed bin Abdul Malik
occupy a distinctive place in respect to their conquests of territory and
the quality of their statecraft. Then followed Umar bin Abu! Aziz .._.... J
11 who was a unique caliph in the dynasty. His caliphate was based on
the era of the rightly guided caliph's Abu Bakr As-Siddiq ~ and Umar
bin Khattab .t,;,. Because he was absorbed with the religion and doing
things for Allah's sake, he did not resemble any caliph of Banu
Umayyah in any way. Though his period of caliphate was very short,
it uplifted the status of the caliphate and despite all kinds of
objectionable and condemnable activities the caliphate of Banu

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Plzase)

251

Umayyah occupies a place of pride by virtue of Omar bin Abdul Aziz
.'ii,,__,.. J· Hisham bin Abdul Malik was a caliph who can be put into the
same category with the three other distinctive caliphs just mentioned.
Not even 10 years passed after Hisham bin Abdul Malik and the
magnificent dynasty of Banu Umayyah collapsed and was leveled
with its foundations destroyed. Except for the five caliphs mentioned
the rest of Banu Umayyah's caliphs were debauched, cowardly,
unconcerned and devoid of sense and foresight. They were not fit to
be the supreme leaders of a vast empire like the caliphate of Banu
Umayyah. Islam had put an end to music and drinking but the caliphs
of Banu Umayyah, restored these destructive habits, which continue
even to this day among the Muslims.
2- One of the crimes on the record of Banu Umayyah worth
mentioning is that Islam had eliminated the discrimination of families
and tribes and united them into a single brotherhood and a single
tribe of believers. Banu Umayyah revived the prejudice and
discrimination of the tribes and provided the impetus to bring back
the fervor of nationalism of the days of ignorance. They reminded the
Arabs of their forgotten habits and the Muslims began to prefer nation
and tribe to Islamic brotherhood. That which they recreated brought
about their ultimate destruction, by the Alawis and the Abbasids
exploiting the instrument of family discrimination and it provided the
method for the ruin of Banu Umayyah.
3- In order to establish and strengthen their rule and caliphate Banu
Umayyah never hesitated in perpetrating atrocities on people and even
utilizing murder as a political solution. The most famous and efficient
Amirs, governors, agents and lieutenants of provinces and states were
those who most mercilessly killed people and employed the strictest
measures of discipline. They adopted a policy of oppression under
compulsion in order to maintain their authority but ultimately the
same policy caused their downfall because the popular sympathy and
support went out of the people's hearts due to living in constant terror.
4- Banu Umayyah was undoubtedly famous and a leader tribe among
the tribes of Quraish in Arabia. The tribe produced people that were
more talented than their contemporaries in matters of counseling and

252

The HistonJ of Islam

planning and understood the principles of the government and
statecraft better than the other tribes. The tribe had acquired these
traits even before the advent of Islam. However, it did not make them
invulnerable to a political misfit being born into their tribe. If the
custom of succession was not followed and the choice of the caliph
was confined only to the tribe of Banu Umayyah, if the Muslims chose
the better and the most qualified from among them, it would have
been an injustice and a mistake but in that case the condition of the
Caliphate of Banu Umayyah would not have worsened so much and
the worfd, -of Islam would not have suffered such a great loss. If this
had been their way, the caliphate of Banu Umayyah probably would
have prolonged its term and the grievances the people had against
them might not have developed in the destructive manner that we
have recorded.
5-Banu Umayyah had superiority over other Arab tribes in respect of
their ability to formulate and implement secret planning, conspiracies
and deceptions, which their caliphate was based upon and
temporarily strengthened by. It is the irony of fate that they were
destroyed by their own methods. The Banu Hashim defeated them
with their own techniques although the Banu Hashim were their
disciples in these matters. This was due to the devastating intoxication
with power and wealth, which completely blinded them and made
them neglectf~l of their own security. The evil practice of succession
only added to their ignorance and carelessness even more.
6- Besides the things mentioned above, Banu Umayyah had some
qualities, which were rarely seen after them and their successors did
not incorporate them into their form of governance. For instance, the
caliphate of Banu Umayyah extended the conquests of the rightly
guided Caliph's to the far corners of the world . They conqaered
China in the East and up to the Atlantic Ocean in the West, the
entire civilized world of their time was under their control. It was
during their empire that Islam reached the distant islands of the
oceans, the sands of the African continent and the plains of India .
Islamic rule had spread everywhere in the world having one center
and one capital. After Banu Umayyah the Muslims rarely had a
chance to conquer new territories virtually the conquest of new lands

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

253

ended with them. Only the government was maintained and after
them even a single Islamic center was gone, separate governments
were formed and established and among them, the caliphate of the
Abbasids was the largest.
7- During the caliphate of Banu Umayyah, the Arabs enjoyed the
pride and position of victors. The Arab morals, the Arabic language,
the Arab culture and the Arab customs and fashions were dominant
everywhere. However, after Banu Umayyah non-Arabs of conquered
nations began to enjoy the privilege of ruling over the Arabs and
refused to recognize the Arab's virtues, qualities and their greatness of
conquest.
8- The Khawarij, Shia and other groups were born before the reign of
Banu Umayyah, yet they faced these challenges using as the basis of
thei,r religious and legal arguments only the Quran and the Hadith.
Except for the Book and the Sunnah, they never recognized anything
else to be qualified for judgment. Later, many groups among the
Muslims were born which diminished the importance of the Book and
the Sunnah and accepted as sufficient the sayings and the personal
judgment in legal matters of their saints, religious teachers, Imams
and institutional scholars. That was why during the caliphate of Banu
Umayyah the attention of the Muslims was always centered on the
Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet ~ - Then followed the
indifference to and carelessness with the Qur' an and the evil increased
to such an extent that in our times today it is not regarded as essential
for a religious scholar to have read and understood the Quran with
meditation and contemplatim1.
9- During the time of the rightly guided caliphs, success and victory
were measured in relation to eliminating 'Shirk' (to associate
anything as a partner with Allah) and deviation and bringing people
to Tawhid (affirmation of the Oneness of Allah) and the worship of
Allah and the religion of Islam as their way of life. Wealth and
material prosperity and grandeur had no value. However, during
the caliphate of Banu Umayyah, wealth and pageantry came to be
regarded as a sign of success and the money of the bait al-ma/
(Islamic treasury) began to be spent on those who could prove
useful and a source of strength for the caliphate and the authority of

254

The History of Islam

the dynasty of Banu Umayyah. Those who were not likely to help
them or those whom they did not think it necessary to keep good
relations with were treated indifferently and denied their rights. This
evil practice increased in the later caliphates even more and selfishness
and internal rivalry and animosity continued increasing among the
general Muslims in the same proportion.
10- In the beginning of Islam and during the rightly guided caliphate,
the Muslims' lives were very simple and their necessities of life were
very limited . During the reign of Banu Umayyah, the use of luxuries
began and the martial life style that they originally prided themselves
on began to disappear by degrees. Beautiful clothes, magnificent
buildings and luxuries began to be used as necessities of life and in
the same proportion the models of Abu Bakr ~ and Umar bin
Khattab 4'i, dwindled.

The efforts of Banu Umayyah's Rivals
The consequence of the rivalry that was created between Banu
Hashim and Banu Umayyah after the martyrdom of Uthman bin
Affan .4-,, and the apparent renunciation of the caliphate by Imam
Hasan ~ after Ali bin Abu Talib .4-,, was that Banu Umayyah
overpowered Banu Hashim militarily and administratively. To take
over of the caliphate by Banu Umayyah after the battles of Jamal and
Siffin and the confrontations with the khawarji posed such a loss to
Banu Hashim that they had felt their inability to get the caliphate and
were not able to use power to retake it. However, the accession of
Yazid to the caliphate after Amir Muawiya .:ffe and the innovation of
hereditary succession was in terms of Islam an obvious major flaw
that made Banu Umayyah vulnerable. Therefore, Imam ~usain ~
took the daring step of trying to retake the caliphate despite the advice
of his sympat!1izers, which resulted in the disaster of Karbala.
Amir Muawiya's weak successor Yazid and Yazid's wicked governor
Ibn Zeyad with his despicable actions were not only deterrents to
Banu Hashim but they also damaged the popularity of the authority of
Banu Umayyah and encouraged and emboldened the masses to
express their opposition to them. That resulted in _the efforts of lbn
Zubair ~ - When the misfortune of Ibn Zubair ~ occurred, the holder

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

255

of the power and authority of Banu Umayyah was a strong man. He
not only regained the power lost to [bn Zubair ruthlessly but also
instilled terror and fear in the people even more. A! this point, there
was no opportunity for the Banu Hashim to use their swords to regain
power. So they adopted another course of action, in the heat of their
anger over the injustices vindictiveness took over their strategy. They
utilized the techniques displayed by Abdullah bin Saba and his
followers, which had caused them to suffer the losses of Siffin and
Azrah. Among the Banu Hashim, only two families had the character
of leadership, one the descendants of Ali bin Abi Talib ~ and the
other the descendants of Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib ~- Ali~ was the
Prophet's cousin and son-in-law and Abbas ~ was his uncle. These
two families were considered from the Prophet's family and their
greatness and leadership was universally recognized. Since Ali~ had
faced hardship directly at the hands of Banu Umayyah, the Alawiites
were more emotional than the Abbasids. Similarly, Imam Husain's
martyrdom caused even more emotional feelings among the Fatimids
than in the Alawiites and so they were more intent on taking revenge. ·
The Alawiites had two groups, one that thought that Imam Husain ~
deserved the caliphate and the other, which felt that Mohammad bin
AI-Hanafia was the most deserving. The third group was the
Abbasids. The most powerful group was the Fatimids or Husaniites
because after Karbala they had more popular sympathy. Secondly,
due to their being the descendants of Fatima hint Muhammad ?JI$ they
commanded the most respect and love.
The second group after them was of Mohammad bin Al-Hanafia
followed immediately by the Abbasids later on the Fatimids were also
divided into two groups, one which supported Zaid bin Ali Husain
and were called Zaidiites and the other which took the oath from
Ismail bin )afar Sadiq and were known as the Ismailies. The abovementioned groups were inimical to Banu Umayyah and friendly to
those supporting the Prophet's family . You have read above about the
deaths qf Zaid bin Ali bin Husain and his son Yahya as well as the
efforts of Mohammad bin Al-Hanafia and the actions taken by
Mukhtar in Kufa. Whenever the Alawiites had an opportunity, they
never missed the chance to revolt but they often met with failure. The
Abbasids continued to take lessons from the Alawiites' activities and

256

their consequences. They continued to make efforts against Banu
Umayyah with great care and foresightedness. All three groups
adopted the same policy to convert the people to their own beliefs
covertly and take the oath from them secretly until they were able to
gain enough power to face and defeat Banu Umayyah. To see this
mission fulfilled they sent their missionaries to different provinces
and states, secretly preached the function of love for the Prophet's
family, exposed the negative qualities in Banu Umayyah's
government and told them that it was the Prophet's family alone who
deserved the caliphate and the authority to govern. This propaganda
work was started with great care, diligence and determination. It had
started from the reign of Abdul Malik bin Marwan and all the three
groups were aware of the activities of the others. Since they had a
common enemy, they had no rivalry or enmity against one another. lf
they stumbled over a secret of the other, they tried their best not to
betray or expose it. They had separate agents and deputies but they
were instructed to avoid using inflammatory words in their preaching
which could bring them into opposition with one of the other groups.
For instance, instead of declaring the greatness and virtues of Abbas
or Mohammad bin Al-Hanafia or Imam Zainul Abedeen, they used
the common expression "the Prophet's family" and by so doing, they
tried their utmost to prove themselves worthy of the caliphate. They
never opposed one another and they even went to the extent to
consider it lawful to help and sympathize with the Khwarij. In the
passion of their opposition to Banu Umayyah, they considered the
Khwarij, as allies when it was expedient. From the very beginning, the
Khwarij called Banu Umayyah unbelievers and always tried to harm
them and even though they were just as inimical to Ali ~ and his
descendants, it served their purposes at times to ally themselves with
the Khwarij. In these secret missions of propagation, the Alawiites
were always too hasty and they did not do their job efficiently.
Because of this, the caliphs of Banu Umayyah had constant
information on the activities and intrigues of the Alawiites and they
had many opportunities to take deterrent action against them.
However, they remained in the dark about the conspiracies of the
Abbasids and so the Banu Umayyah were able to score successes
against the Alawiites but not the Abbasids.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

257

Besides the above-mentioned plans, the Abbasids took another
precaution also. They did not make a large city like Madinah,
Makkah, Kufa, Basra or Damascus their headquarters. They chose as
their capital and the center of all their activities a little known village,
Hamimah, which was a land grant by Banu Umayyah and was located
between Damascus and Madinah and despite being so near to
Damascus, it was safe from the attention of the caliphs and governors
of Banu Umayyah. The efforts and conspiracies of the Alawiites were
always being exposed, and they continued to be killed because of
them. However, Banu Abbas were safe from such harm and the
development of their plans moved ahead moderately. Their progress
speeded up when Mohammad bin Al-Hanafia joined Banu Abbas and
formed a consolidated group. When Abu Hashim bin Mohammad
declared to his followers at the time of his death that Mohammad bin
Ali Abbas at-Hamimah should be their new leader. He emphatically
exhorted those who had been trying to capture the caliphate for Banu
Hashim to continue their efforts under the command of Mohammad
bin Ali and recognize him as the one in command. When such a
formidable group of the Alawiites joined the Abbasids, the latter
started making efforts with greater courage and regularity and most
of the increased power was controlled by the Abbasids. Mohammad
bin Ali Abbasi was the leader of that very formidable group. When he
died in 124 A.H., his son Imam Ibrahim succeeded him. Imam Ibrahim
based the movement on broader and more consistent principles and
assigned well chosen missionary personnel for specific regions and
spread, in an orderly and well organized way, the network of his
movement in the Islamic provinces like Iraq, Khorasan, Persia, Syria,
and the Hijaz. Fortunately, Imam Ibrahim came across a man who
shouldered the entire responsibility of taking the mission to a speedy
success. That man was Abu Muslim Khorasani.
Imam Ibrahim had made Abu Muslim Khorasani the leader of the
missionaries of Iraq and Khorasan and ordered them to work under
him and obey him. He had been in correspondence with Abu Muslim
and kept him informed of all his intentions. This had the benefit that
Imam Ibrahim did not have to correspond with each deputy directly.
After his death his brother, Abdullah bin Saffah succeeded him who

258

The History of Islam

was prudent and wise like Imam Ibrahim. When Abu Muslim's ability
and power were about to produce tangible results, Abu Muslim
increased his activities and took hold of power in Khorasan. Banu
Umayyah came to know about Imam Ibrahim and the Abbasids
movement after Abu Muslim had already imposed his control over
Khorasan. That was the proper time for the emergence of the
movement. The Abbasids did not suffer any losses or meet with
failure because by the time they were known to Banu Umayyah they
already had established themselves.
After Imam Ibrahim's death, Abu Muslim began to gain power in
Khorasan and the symptoms of Banu Umayyah's downfall and ruin
had begun to manifest themselves. Banu Abbas's and the Alawiites's
supporters and accomplices in their stratagem gathered in a house
to select their officers in Dhul Hijjah 130 A.H. on the eve of Hajj in
Makkah. The problems under discussion were how to bring about
Banu Umayyah's fall, the exact plan of how to take the caliphate
from their possession, how to achieve final success quickly and who
should be made the next caliph. The meeting was attended by Abu!
Abbas Abdullah Saffah's brother Abu Jafar Mansoor in addition to a
few noblemen from the descendants of Ali ;,I;;,. The people present in
the meeting supported the idea that Mohammad bin Abdullah bin
Hasan bin Ali known as Nafse Zakia (literally the pure soul) should
be the new caliph and he was chosen unanimously. It was a very
critical occasion because the joint efforts made by the supporters of
Ali ;,I;;, and those of Banu Abbas were responsible for weakening
Banu Umayyah's Sultanate along with the occupation of Khorasan
by Abu Muslim. Had the meeting created dissension between Banu
Abbas and the Alawiites at the meeting a wave of discord would
have traveled immediately from Makkah to the end of Khorasan and
trying to correct such a situation would have caused losses and the
caliphate of Banu Umayyah, which was nearly dead could have
come back to life again. However, Abu Jafar Mansoor's intelligence
and cleverness did not allow him to contradict the choice of the
Alawiites, the result of the meeting was that Ali's ~ supporters
became more active and their efforts proved very helpful to the
Abbasids.

Abu Muslim Khorasani
Abu Muslim's name was Ibrahim bin Uthman bin Bash-Shar. He was
an Iranian by race and was said to be from the descendants of
Barzechamhar. He was born in Isfahan. His parents had settled in a
village adjacent to Kufa. When his father Uthman died, he was seven
years old. His father left instructions in his will for his son to be
brought up and tutored by Isa bin Musa Sarraj. Isa brought him to
Kufa. Abu Muslim learned saddle making from Isa and lived with
him in Kufa. Isa bin Musa traveled to Khorasan, Jazirah and Mousil to
sell his saddles and his business always kept him on a journey and in
contact with all levels of society. It was believed by the authorities that
he was a deputy of Banu Hashim and the Alawiites. Other members
of his family were also suspected and the governor of Kufa, Yusuf bin
Omar, imprisoned Isa bin Musa and his cousin, Idris bin Ma' gal and
their uncle Asim bin Yunus Ajali. Khalid Qasri the former governor
has also inmate at the same prison.
Abu Muslim used to go to the jail to visit Isa bin Musa. Many of the
inmates had been imprisoned for activities against Banu Umayyah
and there were those who had come to hate Banu Umayyah for being
imprisoned by them. Among this group were some captives who were
actually the deputies of Banu Abbas or Banu Fatima and Abu Muslim
was moved by their statements. Very soon, he won their confidence
and became one of their supporters. By chance, Qahtaba bin Shabeeb
who used to propagate Abbasid ideology to the inhabitants of Khorasan
was· leaving for Hamimah. He met those captives of Kufa and was
informed that Isa's and Asim' s servant Abu Muslim was a very clever
and worthy fellow. He invited Abu Muslim to accompany him with the
permission of Isa and they- left for Harnimah together. He presented
Abu Muslim to Imam Ibrahim, Ibrahim said to Abu Muslim "What is
your name?" Abu Muslim said, "My name is Ibrahim bin Uthman bin
Bash-Shar." Imam Ibrahim said, "No your name is now Abdur
Rahman." From that time, he came to be known as Abdur Rahman. It
was Imam Ibrahim who gave him the Kunya Abu Muslim and
borrowed Abu Muslim from Qahtaba bin Shabeeb. This was to establish
an alias for Abu Muslim, which eventually replaced his real name.

260

The History of Islam

[Editors note: In Arabic it is endearing to refer to a man by the title of
"father of" followed by the name of his first son. This is also
applicable to a woman and she is entitled "mother of" and the name
of her first son. In Arabic, this is known as kunya and has no English
equivalent.]
For a few days, Abu Muslim remained in the service of Imam Ibrahim
and the Imam studied his nature and ability. Then the Imam arranged
a marriage with the daughter of one of his famous deputies Abu Najm
Imran bin Ismail. Abu Najm was one of those who were dedicated to
bringing the Islamic caliphate to the descendants of Ali ~ - The
intended benefit from the marriage of Abu Muslim was to solidify the
connection and get the support of Ali's followers and prevent any
weakness in the relation of the two groups. After making these
arrangements, Imam Ibrahim sent Abu Muslim to Khorasan and
informed all the missionaries and deputies that he made him the
administrator of all the territories of Khorasan and that all must follow
him in the work of Banu Hashim. The well-known and active deputies
of Khorasan who had been working since the time of Mohammad bin
Abbasi, Imam Ibrahim's father, were as follows: Sulaiman bin
Katheer, Malik bin Haithan, Zeyad bin Saleh, Talha bin Zuraiq, and
Omar bin Ayun. All of them belonged to the tribe of Khaza'a. Qahtaba
bin Shabeeb bin Khalid bin Sadan was related to the tribe of Tai. Abu
Uyaina, Musa bin Kab, Lahaz bin Qareet, Qasim bin Majashi, and
Aslam bin Salam were from the tribe of Tamim. Abu Dawood Khalid
bin Ibrahim Shibai, Abu Ali Harwi also known as Shibi bin Tahman,
and Abu Najm Imran bin Ismail... When Abu Muslim arrived in
Khorasan, Sulaiman bin Kaseer sent him back due to his young age.
All these deputies were old, matured and experienced. They thought
it inexpedient and unwise to make a man of such a young age to be
their officer and superintendent of their secret activities.
When Abu Muslim reached Khorasan, Abu Dawood Khalid bin
Ibrahim Shibai had gone towards Mawaraunnahr (between the Amu
[Oxus] and Syr rivers in modern Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan) for
some work. When he returned to Merv and read Imam Ibrahim's
letter, he asked the people about Abu Muslim. His friends told him
that Sulaiman bin Katheer had turned him back on account of his

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

261

young age and that he would not be able to perform the required
work and that he would put them and all who were engaged in the
work of propagation into trouble. Abu Dawood assembled all the
deputies and said," Allah endowed the Prophet ~ with the knowledge
of the highest level. His family members are the inheritors of that
knowledge. His family members are the repositories of that
knowledge and they are the successors of the Prophet ~- Have you
any doubt?" The audience said, "No." Abu Dawood said, " Why did
you let doubts creep in? The Imam must have considered the situation
and tested this man and then sent him to us." When they heard him,
they regretted having sent Abu Muslim away. Immediately a man
was sent after him and he brought Abu Muslim back. All recognized
him as the custodian and superintendent of their mission and began to
obey him. As Sulaiman bin Katheer had sent him back at first, Abu
Muslim was a bit displeased with him. Abu Muslim spread out all the
deputies in the various cities and began to strengthen their movement
all over Khorasan. In 129 A.H., Imam Ibrahim wrote to him to see him
on the eve of Hajj that year so that he might receive proper
instructions regarding propagating their doctrine. He also asked him
to bring Qahtaba bin Shabeeb and all funds and goods collected with
him. It is.important to note that the time of Hajj was ideally suited for
such secret conspiracies. People from all over the world come for Hajj.
No one has the chance to suspect others and the conspirators found it
very convenient for meetings and deliberations so they never missed
the Hajj. Abu Muslim along with the other deputies and Qahtaba bin
Shabeeb left for Makkah to see Imam Ibrahim. When he reached
Qaumas, he received a letter from the Imam asking him to return to
Khorasan and if he had not left Khorasan, he should stay there and no
longer conceal his propagation he should do it openly and he should
collect those who had taken the oath and begin the use of power.
Immediately after reading the letter, Abu Muslim returned to Merv
and Qahtaba bin Shabeeb, with all money and material left to go to
Imam Ibrahim. He took the road to Jurjan and on the outskirts of
town, he sent for Khalid bin Barmak and Abu Aun. They came with
money and provisions at once and they all proceeded to the Imam.
When Abu Muslim received the permission to make the propagation
openly and use his power for territorial gains, it was during the time

262

The History of Islam

of the constant battles between Kermani and Nasr bin Sayyar in
Khorasan. As has been mentioned above Abu Muslim collected his
men and pitched his tents between Kermani and Nasr bin Sayyar. At
last Kermani was killed and his son Ali bin Kermani joined Abu
Muslim. Abu Muslim expelled Nasr from Merv and occupied it. But
after staying there for a few days, he left Merv for another part of
Khorasan. Nasr bin Sayyar wrote a letter to Marwan bin Mohammad,
the caliph in Damascus, for reinforcements. Marwan bin Mohammad
was at the time at war with Dahhak bin Qais Khwarji and could not
spare any troops. It was during this period, that Imam Ibrahim's
letter, which he sent to Abu Muslim asking him to kill all the Arabic
speaking people in Khorasan including Nasr and Kermani, was
intercepted. It was presented to Marwan II. That was the first
information that Banu Umayyah had about the conspiracy of the
Abbasids. Marwan wrote to the governor of Balqa to go and arrest
Imam Ibrahim at Hamimah. He was arrested and put in jail as has
been mentioned above. When Abu Muslim started the work of calling
and telling the people openly in Khorasan, the Khorasanis rushed to
him in crowds.
With the beginning of 130 A.H., Abu Muslim started taking the oath
from the people for following the Book of Allah and 'Sunnah' of the
Prophet ~ and obedience to Ahle-Bait. Kermani, Sheeban Khwarji and
Nasr bin Sayyar were angry with him for this action. But as they were
engaged in the warfare, they could not harm him. Following
Kermani's death his son Ali bin Kermani, took over the leadership of
his father's group while Abu Muslim also gained much power. Nasr
bin Sayyar and Sheeban Khawarji were equally powerful as was
stated previously. In Khorasan there were the four powers.
Abu Muslim wanted to draw Sheeban Khwarji towards himself and
induced lbn Kermani to go to him. Nasr bin Sayyar wanted to
reconcile with Sheeban Khawarji so that he might be free to fight with
Abu Muslim. But Abu Muslim manipulated through Ali bin Kermani
in order to prevent them from reconciling with each other. When they
failed in their attempt to reconcile, Abu Muslim, found the situation
advantageous and sent Nasr bin Nairn with a group to Herat. Nasr
bin Nairn reached Herat and captured it while the governor of Herat

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

263

was unprepared and expelled Isa bin Ma'qal Huraishi, Nasr bin
Sayyar's governor. When Yahya ibn Nairn bin Hubairah heard this
news, he called on lbn Kermani and said to him, "Compromise with
Nasr. If you do so, Abu Muslim will be ready to fight with him and
will spare you . And if you do not come to terms with Nasr, Abu
Muslim will make peace with him and be ready to fight with you."
Yahya Shebani at once wrote to Nasr, "We want to make peace with
you". Nasr immediately agreed to it as it coincided with his own
strategy that he had tried to implement with lbn Kermani's father.
Abu Muslim drew the attention of Ali bin Kermani who was the
partner of Sheehan Khwarji, to the previous treachery of Nasr saying,
"Nasr bin Sayyar is your father's killer." The point of this was to bring
ibn Kermani back to the side of Abu Muslim and avoid him making a
pact with Nasr Sayyar. Ali bin Kermani parted with Sheehan Khawarji
at once, and started fighting against him. Abu Muslim arrived to help
lbn Kermani. On the other side Nasr bin Sayyar was ready to fight in
support of Sheeban Khwarji. It was a very strange situation all the
four fighting groups followed different ideologies and doctrines but in
keeping with what ever opportunity presented itself and the proper
time each one of them was busy planning to annihilate the third by
winning the favor of the other two. In the meantime, there were many
sympathizers of Ali 4, in Khorasan and they all joined Abu Muslim.
Abdullah bin Muawiya bin Abdullah bin Jafar bin Abi Talib had taken
the oath for the caliphate from the inhabitants in Kufa, but following
Abdullah bin Omar bin Abdul Aziz's victory they left Kufa along with
some of the people from Kufa and went towards Maclain. Then they
turned towards the mountainous territories and captured them and
occupied Halwan, Qaumas, Isfahan and Rayy. They made Isfahan
their stopping point. In 128 A.H., they brought Shiraz under their
contro~. When Yazid bin Omar bin Hubairah became governor of Iraq,
he sent an army to fight with Abdullah bin Muawiya. They fought
near Istakar (located about 32 miles northeast of Shiraz in the
·,. region
of Faras in southwestern Iran). Abdullah bin Muawiya was defeated.
Many of his men were killed. Mansoor bin Jarnhoor fled towards
Sindh. He was chased but escaped. The men arrested from among
Abdullah bin Muawiya's army included Abdullah bin Ali bin

264

The History of Islam

Abdullah bin Abbas who was released by the governor of Kufa, Yazid
bin Omar. Abdullah bin Muawiya ran away and went to Abu Muslim
for help because he was a well-wisher of the Prophet's family. He
went from Shiraz to Kerman and from there he went to Herat. At
Herat Abu Muslim's governor Nasr bin Nairn, arranged his lodging
and then informed Abu Muslim of his arrival. Abu Muslim wrote
back saying that he should kill Abdullah bin Muawiya and release his
two sons. So, Nasr bin Nairn acted accordingly.
With the beginning of 130 A.H., all the above-mentioned four powers
started clashing with one another. At last, Ali bin Kermani and Abu
Muslim defeated Nasr bin Sayyar and Sheeban Khwarji and captured
Merv. Abu Muslim went to the Amir's palace and took the oath from
the people there and delivered a sermon. Nasr, after losing the battle
went to Nishapur via Sarkhas and Tus. Ali bin Kermani began to live
with Abu Muslim and followed him blindly. Abu Muslim sent word
to the defeated Sheeban Khwarji camped near Merv to take the oath at
his hands. Then Sheeban Khwarji went to Sarkhas and the group of
Bakr bin Wail rallied to him. When Abu Muslim heard about it, he
sent a unit' of his army to Sarkhas. A clash took place and Sheeban was
killed. Abu Muslim then sent his deputies Musa bin Kab and Abu
Dawood Khalid bin Ibrahim to Abyuraw and Balkh respectively. Both
scored victories. Abyuraw and Balkh were brought under occupation.
Then he recalled Abu Dawood and made Yahya bin Nairn the
administrator of Balkh. Zeyad bin Abdur Rahman Qasri who was the
governor of Balkh on behalf of Banu Urnayyah went to Tirrniz after
his defeat at the hands of Abu Dawood entered into correspondence
with Yahya Ibn Nairn and won him to his side. He collected Muslim
bin Abdur Rahman Bahli, Isa bin Zarah Sularni, the rulers of
Takharistan and Mawarannahr, the inhabitants of Balkh and Tirmiz
and taking Yahya bin Nairn along with his men, left to fight with Abu
Muslim. All unanimously agreed and took a pledge to fight with the
holders of black flags the symbol of Banu Abbas. Mugatil bin Hayyan
Nabti was included in the army.
Abu Muslim grasped the situation and sent Abu Dawood to Balkh
again. The two sides clashed along side of the river at a little distance
from Balkh. Muqatil bin Hayyan Nabti was accompanied by Abu
Sayeed Qurashi. The rear guard of the army was kept fully armed so

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

265

that the enemy would not attack them from behind. When the battle
was in the full swing, Abu Sayeed Qurashi whose army was the rear
guard and whose flag was also black by coincidence wanted to
engage the enemy and decided to advance. When he moved up with
his army, those on the front line forgot that a flag of theirs was also
black and as soon as they saw Abu Sayeed's flag, they thought that
Banu Abbas had defeated the rea r guard and their army was moving
ahead victoriously. This caused a panic and the front line troops ran
off the battlefield. Many of them were drowned in the river and died.
This freak occurrence resulted in a victory for Banu Abbas and Zeyad
and Yahya took Tirmiz and Abu Dawood occupied Balkh.
After the victory Abu Muslim recalled Abu Dawood from Balkh and
deputed Nasr bin Sabih Muzani as its ruler. As recorded above, Ali
bin Kermani lived with Abu Muslim. His brother Othman bin Kermani
was also with him. Abu Dawood counseled Abu Muslim that it was
essential to separate the two brothers from each other. Abu Muslim
liked the idea and so he sent Othman bin Kermani as the ruler of Balkh
and when he reached Balkh, he made Farafza bin Zahir his deputy.
Othman bin Kermani along with Nasr bin Muzani, went to Marwarood.
This news prompted Muslim bin Abdur Rahman Bahli to take the
Egyptians with him and attack Balkh, which he captured it by force.
When Othman and Nasr Muzani received this information, they left
Marwarood and returned to Balkh. Their arrival instilled fear in
Abdur Rahman's men and they evacuated Balkh at night. Nasr
Muzani from one side and Othman from the other side invaded Balkh.
Nasr's soldiers did not interfere with the evacuating army but
Uthman bin Kermani started to fight them as they fled after being
defeated. Many were killed and Balkh escaped being lost to the
Abbasids by a very thin margin. When they heard this news Abu
Muslim and Abu Dawood counseled with each other and Abu
Muslim went to Nishapur and Abu Dawood came back to Balkh. Abu
Muslim was accompanied by Ali bin Kermani. He murdered Ali bin
Kermani on the way to Nishapur. Abu Dawood in keeping with the
counsel he had made with Abu Muslim captured Balkh, forced Abdur
Rahman to flight and murdered Uthman bin Kermani. In this way,
they settled the issue of the two brothers. You have read above that

266

The History of Islam

Imam Ibrahim had first sent for Abu Muslim and then stopped him
and asked him to make his propagation openly. Abu Muslim had sent
Qahtaba bin Shabeeb with money and goods. Qahtaba met Imam
Ibrahim and presented the money and goods. Imam Ibrahim sent a
flag through him and asked him to go from Makkah to Khorasan. He
himself returned to Hammiah. He was arrested soon after his arrival
there. Qahtaba went to Abu Muslim with the flag and Abu Muslim
put it with the vanguard and made Qahtaba its leader. Before the end
of 130 A.H., he occupied the greater part of Khorasan and removed all
his enemies. After killing Ali bin Kermani, Abu Muslim returned to
Merv and sent Qahtaba towards Tus along with the military leaders
like Abu Aun Abdul Malik bin Yazid, Khalid bin Barmak, Uthman bin
Naheek and Khazim bin Khuzaima. The inhabitants of Tus fought
back but suffered defeat. Qahtaba massacred them mercilessly. Then
he made preparations for leading an attack on Tamim bin Nasr who
was at Suzqan. Tamim bin Nasr was killed along with his 3,000 men.
Qahtaba entered the city and ordered a general massacre and deputed
Khalid bin Earmark to collect the booty. Then he intended to go to
Nishapur where Nasr bin Sayyar was staying. Nasr fled from there to
Qaumas. Qahtaba captured Nishapur in the beginning of Ramadan
130 A.H. and stayed there up to the end of Shawwal. From Kufa Yazid
bin Omar bin Hubairah sent reinforcements to Nasr bin Sayyar under
the command of the governor of Kufa, Nabata bin Hanzala. Nasr bin
Sayyar did not stay long at Qaumas. He left for Jurjan. Nabata bin
Hanzala along with his army reached Nasr bin Sayyar. Qahtaba left
Nishapur and marched towards Jurjan in the beginning of Dhul Qadah.
When Qahtaba's men heard of the arrival of Nabata bin Hanzala
along with a huge Syrian army at Jurjan, they were terrified. Qahtaba
made an emotional speech to them, saying, 'Imam Ibrahim has
predicted that you will face a huge army and be victorious over it." It
encouraged the soldiers. At last, there was a battle. Nabata bin
Hanzala was killed along with his 10,000 men. Qahtaba achieved a
grand victory. He cut off Nabata bin Hanzala's head and sent it to
Abu Muslim. This battle was fought in the month of Dhul Hijjah 130
A.H. Qahtaba occupied Jurjan and killed 30,000 of its citizens. After
defeat in Jurjan, Nasr bin Sayyar went towards Khawarurrai. The
governor there was Abu Bakr Aqili . When Yazid bin Hubairah was

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

267

briefed on the situation, he sent a huge army under the command of
lbn Ghaleef to reinforce Nasr bin Sayyar. Qahtaba sent his son, Hasan
bin Qahtaba from Jurjan to Khawarurrai. He sent another army from
the rear under the command of Abu Kami! and Abul Qasim Sahrz bin
Ibrahim and Abu! Abbas Marwzi to help Hasan. When they reached
the vicinity of Hasan's army, Abul Kami! parted with his men and
joined Nasr and informed him of the activities of Hasan's army. At
last, they fought and Hasan bin Qahtaba suffered a crushing defeat.
Nasr sent the booty and the good tidings of victory to Yazid bin Omar
bin Hubairah. This occurred in Muharram 131 A.H. While Nasr's
messengers were leaving with the spoils of war and the news of
victory Ibn Ghaleef, Nasr's ally was approaching with his army. They
met outside of Rayy and lbn Ghaleef took the valuables and the letter
and camped there.
Nasr did not approve of Ibn Ghaleef taking the valuables and the
letter that was supposed to go to their superior Yazid bin Omar. Nasr
decided to go to Rayy, lbn Ghaleef along with his army marched
towards Hamadan but latter on he turned to Isfahan. Nasr on the
night of 10 Muharram in 132 A.H. entered the Governor's
headquarters at Rayy and captured it. Abu Muslim's arrival in
Nishapur caused Nasr bin Sayyar's departure, he went to Rayy and
stayed there for two days and on the third day, he became sick. As
soon as he felt sick, he left Rayy and went to Sada immediately after
his arrival he died, it was the 121h of Rabia Awwal 131 A.H. After his
death, his men went to Hamadan, in west-central Iran. The ruler of
Rayy was Habib bin Yazid Nahshali. When Qahtaba bin Shabeeb left
Jurjan he took his army to Rayy, after Nasr's death, Habib bin Yazid
and the Syrians who were with him left Rayy without fighting.
Qahtaba, who was fighting on behalf of the Abbasids, occupied Rayy
and confiscated the wealth and belongings of its citizens. Most of
those who escaped Rayy went to Hamadan where Nasr Sayyar's men
had gone. Qahtaba sent his son Hasan to Hamadan but they avoided
Hamadan and went to Nahawand. Hasan reached Nahawand and
laid siege to it. In 129 A.H., Yazid bin Omar bin Hubairah, who was
fighting on behalf of the Umayyahs, sent his son Dawood bin Yazid
along with Amir bin Sabarah to battle against Abdullah bin Muawiya
and they went up to Kerman fighting. They were encamped at

268

The History of Islam

Kerman with a large army. When Yazid bin Omar bin Hubairah was
informed of Nabata bin Hanzla's death, he wrote to Dawood and lbn
Sabarah and asked them to go ahead and fight against Qahtaba . Both
left from Kerman having increased their already large army and
arrived at Isfahan. Qahtaba deputed Muqatil bin Hakeem to face
them. He was camped at Qum. Having heard that Hasan bin Qahtaba
had besieged Nahawand, south of Hamadan, lbn Sabarah made up
his mind to save it. He decided to take on Muqatil and moved forward
to fight against him. When the two armies clashed, Qahtaba' s soldiers
fought so bravely that lbn Sabarah's soldiers were defeated and lbn
Sabarah himself was kil1ed.
This occurred in the month of Rajab 131 A.H. Qahtaba sent the news
of the victory to his son Hasan. He stayed at Isfahan for twenty more
days and then went to Hasan and joined the siege. For three months,
the citizens of Nahawand remained besieged. At last, it was captured
and many of the inhabitants were put to death. Then Qahtaba sent
Hasan to Hal wan, which was easily captured. He then sent Abu Aun
Abdul Malik bin Yazid Khorasani to invade the city of Zor. The
administrator of the city was Uthman bin Sufyan. Abdullah bin
Marwan bin Mohammad controlled the vanguard. Abu Aun and
Uthman continued to fight until the end of Dhul Hijja finally Uthman
was killed and his army lost the battle. Abu Aun Abdul Malik
occupied the city of Mousil.
When Amir bin Sabarah was killed. Dawood bin Yazid fled to his
father. When Dawood bin Yazid told his father, Yazid bin Omar bin
Hubairah, the details of the defeat he gathered a large army and
Caliph Marwan bin Mohammad also sent Hausrah bin Sohail Bahli to
help him. Yazid bin Omar bin Hubairah along with Hausrah bin
Sohail reached Halwan. Meanwhile, Qahtaba also moved towards
Halwan and crossed the river Tigris near Anbar, (an ancient
Mesopotamian town located on the left bank of the Euphrates River in
central Iraq.) Yazid bin Omar turned towards Kufa and sent Hausrah
with 15,000 soldiers to move to Kufa also. Qahtaba crossed the river
Euphrates from the Anbar side on 8 Muharram 132 A.H. At the time,
Yazid bin Omar bin Hubariah was camped at a distance of 23 miles
from the mouth of the Euphrates. His men advised him to go to

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

269

Khorasan instead of Kufa and Qahtaba would of necessity give up his
intention of going to Kufa and follow them. Yazid bin Omar did not
agree to the opinion and crossed the Tigris near Madain and both the
armies began to move along either side of the Euphrates. Qahtaba
crossed it at a place where the water was not deep. A fierce battle was
fought. Yazid bin Omar bin Hubiarah's army suffered a defeat but
Qahtaba was killed. When he was wounded, he ordered that the
caliphate of Ali's supporters must be established in Kufa with Abu
Salma as its 'Amir' . Hausrah, Yazid and Nabata fled to Wasit.
Qahtabah's army chose Hasan bin Qahtaba as its leader. When the
news reached Kufa, Mohammad bin Khalid Qasri collected all the
supporters of Ali ~ and revolted.
After receiving this news, Hausrah returned from Wasit to Kufa and
besieged Mohammad bin Khalid in the Governor's headquarters of
Kufa . At this point Hausrah' s men· accepted the invitation of the
Abbasids and began to abandon him. Being compelled by these
events, he went back to Wasit. Mohammad bin Khalid informed
Qahtaba of the incident and of his occupation of the Governor's
headquarters. Hasan bin Qahtaba entered Kufa, took Mohammad bin
Khalid with him, visited Abu Salma and they selected Abu Salma as
the Amir of Ali' s supporters and took the oath with him. Abu Salma
sent Hasan bin Qahtaba towards Wasit to fight with Ibn Hubairah and
made Mohammad bin Khalid the governor of Kufa. Then Abu Salma
sent Humaid bin Qahtaba towards Madain. Ahwaz in southwestern
Iran was ruled over by Abdur Rahman bin Omar bin Hubairah. He
fought with Bassam. Abdur Rahman lost and fled to Basra where
Muslim bin Qutaiba Bahli was the ruler. After defeating Abdur
Rahman, Bassam sent Sufyan bin Muawiya bin Yazid bin Muhallab to
take over Basra. Muslim came out victorious. He kept Basra under his
occupation until he received the news of Yazid bin Omar's death,
upon hearing this news h_e evacuated Basra. Mohammad bin Jafar
found the way clear and captured it. After a few days Abu Malik
Abdullah bin Osaid Khazai reached Basra on behalf of Abu Muslim.
Abu! Abbas Saffah publicly took the oath for his caliphate from the
people and deputed Sufyan bin Muawiya as the governor of Basra.
At the time of Imam Ibrahim's death, the following members of his

270

The History of Islam

family were present at Hamimah: Abu! Abbas Abdullah Saffah, Abu
Jafar Mansoor and Abdul Wahab. These three were Imam Ibrahim's
brothers. Then there were Mohammad bin lbrahim, Isa bin Musa,
Dawood, Isa, Saleh, Ismail, Abdullah, and Abdus Samad. The last
being Imam Ibrahim's uncle.
Before his arrest, Imam Ibrahim had made his brother Abu] Abbas
Abdullah Saffah his successor and at the time of his death, he ordered
him to go to Kufa and live there. In accordance to the will of Imam
Ibrahim, Abul Abbas Abdullah Saffah left Hamimah along with the
above-mentioned members of his family and went to Kufa. When he
reached Kufa, Abu Salma had already established his rule firmly in
Kufa . Abu Salma was Imam Ibrahim's deputy and superintendent of
the movement there. However, since then all his attempts were
directed towards making Ali's descendents the caliph. Qahtaba bin
Shabeeb also was in favor of the same. Since Abu Hashim bin
Mohammad (the leader of the descendants of Ali ~ ) had left a will
that Mohammad bin Ali Abbasi (the leader of BarlU Abbas at the time
of Abu Hashim) should be recognized as the leader of his group, he
could not decide what to do.
When he received the news that Abu! Abbas was approaching with
the supporters of Ali~ he came up to Hamam Ayun to receive him and
lodged him at Waleed bin Sad's house and kept it as a guarded secret
from all of the supporters of Ali ~ and the commanders of the army for
forty days. Abu Salma wanted somebody from among the descendants
of Abi Talib to be made caliph and the oath be taken for him. But Abu
Jaham who was from among the supporters of Ali~ disagreed with
him. He felt that by declaring their caliphate by the descendants of Ali
bin Abi Talib ~ they could be deprived of the caliphate and the people
might recognize Abul Abbas as the caliph. Had Abul Abbas not come to
Kufa in accordance to Imam Ibrahim's will, Abu Salma might have
possibly succeeded in making the descendants of Abu Talib the caliph.
Abu Salrna did not want the people to know about the arrival of Abu!
Abbas and become attracted towards him. So meanwhile Abu Salama
wrote a letter to Imam Jafar Sadiq bin Imam Baqar bin Imam Zainul
Abedeen bin Husain bin Ali requesting him to come to Kufa and be the
caliph. He replied in the negative.

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

271

By chance, the people came to know about Abu! Abbas Saffah' s
arrival in Kufa . Now there were two kinds of people in Kufa . One
group who wanted the caliphate for the descendants of Abbas ~ and
the other who wanted it for the descendants of Ali bin Abi Talib ,t.,.
The Abbasids began to throng about Abul Abbas Saffah. The
supporters of Ali ~ also began to visit him. When the people were
informed that Abu Salma, the governor of Kufa, known as the
minister for the Prophet' s family had not fulfilled the conditions of
playing host to Abu! Abbas Abdullah Saffah, many of Ali's supporters
became supporters of Abdullah Saffah. His presence in Kufa won
popular attention and sympathy to himself. Ultimately on 12 Rabia
Awwal Friday 132 A.H. corresponding with 30 October 749 AD, the
people assembled, took Abu! Abbas Abdullah Saffah from his
residence and brought him to the Governor's headquarters. Abdullah
Saffah then came to grand mosque, made a sermon, led the Friday
congregational prayers and ascended the pulpit and made another
sermon and took the oath from the people. His sermon was very
eloquent and instructive. He proved himself worthy of the caliphate
and promised to increase their stipends and then praised the Kufans.
After this sermon Abdullah Saffah's uncle Dawood climbed up to the
pulpit and delivered a lecture and praised the caliphate of Banu
Abbas in well-expressed words, condemned Banu Umayyah and said
to the people, "As Amir al-Muminin Abdullah Saffah suffers from
fever and pain in the limbs today, he could not speak much. Pray for
him." Then Abdullah Saffah went to the Governor' s headquarters and
his brother Abu Jafar Mansoor continued to take the oath from the
people on his behalf in the mosque until late at night. Abdullah Saffah
then visited Abu Salama's tent. Abu Salma took the oath no doubt but
he was not happy that the oath and the caliphate went to the Abbasids
in his heart. Abdullah Saffah handed over deputyship of the adjoining
areas of Kufa to his uncle Dawood and sent his other uncle Abdullah
bin Ali to help Abu Aun and his nephew Isa bin Musa to help
Qahtaba who lay besieging Ibn Hubairah in Wasit and Tamimi bin
Jafar bin Tamim bin Abbas to help Hama'd bin Qahtaba in Madain. In
this way, he dispatched and deputed his leaders everywhere. Abu
Muslim was present in Khorasan and was purging it of all the enemies
of the Abbasids. When Abu! Abbas became caliph and came to Kufa,

272

The History of Islam

he consulted Abu Muslim on all important issues and acted as he
advised.
This was a very critical and dangerous time in the Islamic world .
Wars and feuds had broken out in every province and state. It was
very difficult to subdue Yazid bin Omar bin Hubairah in Wasit. On
the other side Marwan bin Mohammad, the Umayyah caliph, was in
power in Syria. There was chaos in the Hijaz. The condition of Egypt
was also bad. The movement of the Abbasids had no influence in
Spain. Umayyah leaders were in power in Jazirah and Armenia and
were ready to rise up against the Abbasids and Khorasan was not
fully under control. The Abbasids could not establish their
government in Basra either. Hadramaut, Yamamah and Yemen were
also no better. As soon as Abdullah Saffah took over as caliph, there
appeared dissension among the descendants of Ali bin Abi Talib.:;.
also known as the Alawis, who were partners until then. They were
surprised and aggrieved at the ascension of the Abbasids because they
expected their own caliphate to be established. The responsibility and
credit of this great success by the Abbasids rested on the last will and
testament of Mohammad bin Hanafia's son Abu Hisham Abdullah,
which he bequeathed at the time of his death in favor of Mohammad
bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas. This final testament led the Kisanya
sect of the supporters of Ali ~ to form a belief that Mohammad bin
Hanafia was the Imam after Ali bin Abi Talib~- Then followed his
son Abu Hisham Abdullah, then Mohammad bin Ali Abbasi, his son
Imam Ibrahim and finally Abdullah Saffah, the present Imam. Thus, a
large section of the supporters of Ali parted with the other Aliwiites
and joined the Abbasids, and the Alawiites or the Fatimids did not
have a chance to stand in opposition to the Abbasids and they
suffered distress an anxiety over their predicament.
When Marwan bin Mohammad the last caliph of Banu Umayyad, was
killed, Habib bin Murrah, the governor of Balqa came out holding a
white flag . Aqil of Qansareen also rose up though he had already
taken the oath for Abdullah bin Ali Abbasi. The citizens of Hims also
joined him. Then the governor of Armenia Ishaq bin Muslim Aqili,
also stood in revolt against the Abbasids. To put down all the
rebellions Abdullah Saffah sent his leaders and relatives and they

Caliphate of Banu Urnayyah (Second Phase)

273

succeeded by degrees . However, Yazid bin Omar bin Hubariah was
still in occupation of Wasit and no leader was able to defeat him.
Compelled by this situation, Abu }afar Mansoor and Abdullah Saffah
made peace with him and as part of the terms he was ready to take the
oath. However, Abu Muslim from Khorasan wrote to Abdullah Saffah
saying, "Yazid bin Omar's existence will remain a danger you should
kill him." So, Mansoor Abbasi killed him by treachery and eliminated
the danger.
Now Abu Salama alone survived in Kufa and apparently, there was no
excuse for murdering him because the Abbasids in the beginning did
not want to oppose the supporters of Ali ~ openly. Abu Salama's
deta_iled record was sent to Abu Muslim in order to get his opinion. He
replied back that he should be put to death at once. Reading this
Abdullah Saffah at the instance of his uncle, Dawood, wrote to Abu
Muslim. "If we kill him, we run the risk of open opposition and
rebellion from Abu Salama's supporters and the supporters of Ali ~Please send some one from there to kill Abu Salama." Abu Muslim
deputed Murad bin Anas to kill Abu Salama. Murad came to Kufa and
one day while Abu Salma was going somewhere, he struck him with his
sword so powerfully that he immediately fell dead and Murad escaped .
It was rumored that some Khwarij killed Abu Salama. After the murder,
Abu Muslim similarly had Sulaiman bin Katheer killed. He is the same
Sulaiman bin Katheer who had rejected Abu Muslim when he first
arrived in Khorasan as Imam Ibrahim's chief deputy. In short, Abu
Muslim had everybody who opposed him murdered.

Massacre of Banu Umayyad by Abbasids
The nation or dynasty that claims the Islamic Caliphate as their
hereditary right is suffering from a gross misunderstanding and does
an injustice to themselves and the Muslims in general. If Banu
Umayyah wanted to retain the Islamic rule in their own community or
family, they were unjustified. If Banu Abbas or Banu Hashim took it
as a matter of their right, they were also wrong and unjust. But as
people in the world think unjustifiably so, they take for granted the
continuation of the right of succession in government and its authority
too. So, if a man snatches by force his right from a usurper, he often

i
j,

,·

274

The History of Islam

takes resort to murder and violence. However, the way such murders
and violence were justified by Banu Abbas in respect to Banu
Umayyah, is unprecedented. Yes, if semi~historical stories are to be
relied upon by going beyond the historical age, Bukht Nassar had
murdered Bani Israel (children of Israel i.e., Jews) mercilessly and
audaciously and wanted to end their existence on the surface of the
globe. But we see that Bani Israel still survives in the world today.
More than this, the Aryans in India perpetrated all kinds of atrocities
on the non-Aryans but the forests of the Himalayas and the Vindhya
chal range in northern India, and the sands of Rajasthan in
northwestern India kept them covered and the Shudra community of
the Hindus form a remarkable part of the Indian population even
today (Shudras were, non-Aryan cultivators, who came under the
domination of the Aryans and in many cases were enslaved). The
Aryans of India were the Iranians and Khorasanis. The Khorasani
commanders of the Abbasids persuaded the Abbasids to use such
violence and cruelty in killing Banu Umayyah that all other stories of
atrocities pale in comparison. From the study of conspiratorial activity
all over the world, it emerges that for those who want to make their
conspiracy a success it is necessary to commit limitless killing,
bloodshed, oppression and cruelty to instill terror in the population to
eliminate opposition. In this history of Islam, we also have constantly
found proof of this fact. Taking the Islamic caliphate from the family
of Banu Umayyah was not a crime but to give it to another family in
similar fashion was certainly not a m~tter of credit. Islam and the
world of Islam could not have benefited from it. Therefore, Banu
Abbas committed shameful deeds, bloodshed and slaughter to
accomplish such a task.
A short account of the massacre resorted by Abu Muslim, Qahtaba bin
Shabeeb and other deputies in the name of the Prophet's family, in the
cities of Khorasan has been given in the above pages. Imam Ibrahim
had written to Abu Muslim in his last letter emphatically not to spare
even a single Arabic speaker in Khorasan. He meant by that the Arab
tribes in Khorasan which supported Banu Umayyah and lived there as
royalty. The inhabitants of the city who were non-Muslims and could
have been converted to support the Umayyahs were killed by Abu
Muslim. Consequently those Arab tribes which reached Khorasan in

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Second Phase)

275

large numbers and were succeeding in turning the country's language
and society into Arabic were all put to death and the Arabic factor
which was influencing the whole country suddenly lost its power and
died. That was how the Iranian language, culture, society and
morality which were dying, got a new lease of life and Iran and
Khorasan which could have been Arab countries like Egypt turned
into Persian countries again. Abu Muslim himself was a Khorasani
and Iranian by race and for him there was no job more interesting and
enjoyable than killing the Arabs. National prejudice which Islam had
uprooted completely emerged during the reign of Banu Umayyah
again and it was through the y.se of this national bigotry and
discrimination between tribes that Banu Umayyah had rendered all
Arab tribes specifically Banu Hashim helpless. When the others knew
that a certain person belonged to Banu Umayyah, they looked at him
with fear. As soon as they got better of Banu Umayyah, they spent all
their energy in securing themselves from this dange/ and fear. They
made up their mind to exterminate them from the face of the earth.
When Abdullah Saffah's uncle Abdullah bin Ali entered Damascus on
5 Ramadan 132 A.H ., he ordered a general massacre. When the last
Umayyah caliph Marwan bin Mohammad was killed in Egypt, the
most important duty the Abbasids had, was the extermination of Banu
Umayyah. Some Umayyads also joined Banu Abbas in pulling down
the high palace of the caliphate of Banu Umayyah and lived with the
victorious Abbasids with honor. So, the destruction of the seed of
Banu Umayyah completely was not possible. However, Abu Muslim
was prepared to undertake this task nonetheless. He wrote to
Abdullah Saffah and the leaders of the Abbasids repeatedly to kill any
individual of Banu Umayyah no matter how sympathetic or how
much of a supporter he might be. The orders were carried out no
doubt however there were some persons who in large numbers had
joined the Abbasids against the Umayyah caliph and helped them in
critical situations. Human propriety and nobility prevented them from
killing these helpers. Abu Muslim sent bribes and instructions to the
poets and courtiers who frequented the courts of the Abbasi caliphs
and commanders to recite poems, and talk to incite the Abbasids
against Banu Umayyah so that they would continue to hunger for
revenge and murder. That resulted in driving the Abbasids to capture

276

The History of Islam

and kill all the Banu Umayyah. Saffah had Sulaiman bin Hisham bin
Abdul Malik killed in the open court at once after being incited by the
recitation of such a poem though Sulaiman was a friend and
supporter of Saffah. During the days when Abdullah bin Ali was in
Palestine, he was taking a meal beside the river of Abi Fatras 80 or 90
persons of Banu Umayyah were dining with him. Meanwhile Shibi bin
Abdullah arrived and he started reading poems containing the
condemnation of Banu Umayyah, details of the murder of Imam
Ibrahim and finally instigation to kill Banu Umayyah. Abdullah bin
Ali, Abdullah Saffah's uncle at once ordered their execution. His
servants began to kill them. Some of them were killed instantly while
others were severely injured but still alive. Abdullah bin Ali had all
the dead and wounded placed side by side and had his servants make
their bodies into the dining surface for the food. Then the meal was
served on top of them and he along with all his friends ·sat and ate.
They were eating while under the food those who had not yet died
were moaning, they continued eating until the injured died from their
wounds. The list of the murdered included Mohammad bin Abdul
Malik, Mu'izz bin Yazid, Abdul Wahid bin Sulaiman, Sayeed bin
Abdul Malik, Abu Obaidah bin Waleed bin Abdul Malik. Some say
that the deposed caliph Ibrahim was also among them. In Damascus,
the same Abdullah bin Ali bin Abbas had the graves of the caliphs of
Banu Umayyah dug up. A skull was taken out of Abdul Malik's
grave. Nothing came out of Amir Muawiya's grave. Some graves
produced limbs and the rest had turned into dust. When Hisham bin
Abdul Malik's grave was dug up, the tip of his nose was gone
otherwise his entire body was intact. Abdullah bin Ali had his dead
body lashed, hung and then had it burned having the ashes blown
away by the wind. Abdullah Ali's brother Sulaiman bin Ali bin
Abdullah bin Abbas killed a group of Banu Umayyah in Basra and
had their dead bodies thrown on the road and forbade their burial.
Dogs continued to eat them for a long time. Abdullah bin Ali's other
brother, Saffah 's uncle Dawood bin Ali, captured and killed every
Umayyah in Makkah, Madinah and the entire Hijaz until nothing
remained of Banu Umayyah. In short, all over the territory it was
proclaimed that wherever a member of Banu Umayyah was found, he
should be put to death at once. Just as people leave their houses to

Caliphate of Banu Umayyah (Se~pnd Phase)

277

hunt wild animals, similarly they used to go out of their houses to kill
the members of Banu Umayyah until they could not find refuge in any
house, village or city. The Abbasids went on searching for them and
killing them for years. Abu Muslim had the job in Khorasan done
more effectively and audaciously. He killed not only Banu Umayyah
but also those who had ever supported Banu Umayyah or did them
any service. Those who managed to escape from the general massacre
went to other places, disguised themselves, changed their names and
places of origin and went pass the Islamic borders.
The provinces and states of Khorasan witnessed the general massacre
in its most horrible form, all the Banu Umayyah and all the tribes
sympathetic to them, escaped to Sindh, Mount Sulaiman and Kashmir
and took refuge there. Those who had changed the names of their
tribes also crossed the Islamic borders, because they could not find
peace within the jurisdiction of the Abbasids authority.

It is said that the descendants of these runaway Arab tribes who came
to Sindh, Kashmir, and the Punjab are still to be found in India
unaware of their Arab blood because their ancestors had changed
their names and professions.
One person from among the Banu Umayyah, Abdur Rahman bin
Muawiya bin Hisham, escaped from becoming the prey of the
Abbasids. He arrived in Spain via Egypt and Qairwan. As Spain was
comparatively free from the influence of the Abbasids and the
supporters of Banu Umayyah were found in large numbers there, he
occupied it immediately after his arrival and founded a separate rule
and caliphate, which the Abbasid caliphs always viewed with envy yet
were unable to harm it.

Chapter 3

The Caliphate of the Abbasids
· (First Phase)

Abu I Abbas saffah
Abu! Abbas Abdullah Saffah bin Mohammad bin Ali bin Abdullah
bin Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib bin Hashim was born and raised at
Hamimah in Balqa area in 104 A.H. He succeeded his brother. He was
younger than his brother Mansoor. Ibn Jareer says one day the
Prophet ~ said to his uncle Abbas ~ , "The Caliphate will come to
your descendants", the descendents of Abbas were looking forward to
it ever since that time.
Abdullah Saffah enjoyed distinction in his ability to cause bloodshed,
competitive generosity and intelligence. His Governors and Officials
were also experts at spilling blood. Saffah first deputed his uncle
Dawood as Governor of Kufa and then made him the Amir of the
Hijaz, Yemen and Yamama and appointed his nephew Isa bin Musa
bin Mohammad as Governor of Kufa.
When Abu Dawood died in 133 A.H., Saffah made his maternal uncle
Yazid bin Obaidullah bin Abdul Madan Harthi and his cousin
Mohammad bin Yazid bin Obaidullah bin Abdul Madan the Governors

280

The History of Islam

of Hijaz plus Yamama and Yemen respectively. In 132 A.H., Sufyan
bin Uyaina Halbi was made the administrator of Basra and then in 133
A.H., he was deposed and ·this office was given to Saffah's uncle
Sulaiman bin Ali and the Sultanate of Bahrain and Oman were also
annexed to his territory. In 132 A.H. Saffah's uncle Ismail bin Ali,
another uncle Abdullah bin Ali, Abu Aun Abdul Malik bin Yazid and
Abu Muslim Khorasani were Governors of Ahwaz, Syria, Egypt and
Khorasan with Jabal respectively. Khalid bin Barmak was the Revenue
Officer in Khorasan. In 133 A.H., Abu Muslim appointed Mohammad
bin Ash' ath the Governor of Persia on his own. At the same time,
Saffah sent his uncle Isa bin Ali with the certificate of Governorship
for Persia. Muhammad bin Ash'ath had already been installed there.
When Isa bin Ali reached there, Muhammad bin Ash'ath refused to
hand over the government of Persia to him and then took a promise
from him that he would not deliver the Friday sermon from the
pulpit and not to take up sword except to declare [ihad, then he
handed over the authority of Persia to him but in fact, he himself
remained the ruler. When Mohammad Ash'ath died, Saffah sent his
uncle Ismail bin Ali as the Governor of Persia. Then he sent
Mohammad bin Sool as the Governor of Mousil. The citizens of
Mousil expelled Mohammad bin Saal.
They were against Banu Abbas. Getting angry Saffah sent his brother
Yahya bin Mohammad bin Ali with 12,000 warriors. Yahya reached
Mousil and stayed at the Governor's headquarters and sent for the
leaders of Mousil and had them all killed through treachery. The
inhabitants of Mousil were highly agitated because of this. They
prepared themselves to fight. Yahya made a proclamation, saying.
"Whosoever enters the Central Mosque will be granted pardon.
Hearing it, they rushed towards the Central Mosque.
Yahya had his men standing guard at the doors of the Central
Mosque. Who ever entered it was killed. In this way, 11,000 people
were killed. Then a general massacre was ordered in the city. When it
was night, Yahya heard the lamentations of the women whose
husbands, fathers, brothers and sons were unjustly killed. In the
morning, he ordered even the women and children to be put to
death. For three days in succession, the killing of the citizens was
declared to be legal. With this declaration, the massacre in the city was

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

281

enjoined with greater ferocity.
There were 4000 black soldiers in Yahya's army. During the slaughter,
they turned to raping_ the women. Thousands of women were
kidnapped. On the fourth day, Yahya came into the city on horse back
for inspection. A woman gathered her courage and caught hold of the
·reins of his horse and said, "Are you not of Banu Hashim? Are you
not the son of the Prophet's ~ uncle? Don't you know that the black
soldiers have married the Muslim women by force?" Yahya did not
answer and went away. The next day, he sent for all the black soldiers
to disburse their salaries and when all of them had assembled, he
ordered them to be killed.
When Saffah was informed of this, he sent Ismail bin Ali to Mousil
and transferred Yahya to Persia. In 133 A.H., the Roman Emperor took
Maltiya and Qaliqala from the Muslims by force . The same year Yazid
bin Obaidullah bin Abdul Madan gave an army to Ibrahim bin
Hibban Sulami and sent him from Madinah to Yamama where
Muthanna bin Yazid bin Omer bin Hubairah had been in power since
his father's time. He fought [brahim and was killed. The same year
Shareek bin Shaikh Mehri in. Bukhara revolted and gathered 30,000
men. Abu Muslim sent Zeyad bin Saleh Khazai against Shareek who
fought ~nd was killed. Abu Muslim sent Abu Dawood Khalid bin
Ibrahim to invade the city of Khatal in 133 A.H. Habsh bin Shibl, the
king of Khatal, suffered defeat and escaped to China via Farghana in
eastern Uzbekistan. The same year saw the war between the kings of
Akhsheed, Farghana and Shash. The Chinese king intervened and sent
one hundred thousand man army against them. Abu Muslim sent
Zeyad bin Saleh to meet it. The clash with the Chinese army took
place along the river of Taraz 50,000 Chinese were killed and 20,000
were captured by the Muslims.
In 134 A.H. Bassam bin Ibrahim Bassam, a Khorasani Commander of
repute, occupied Maclain. Saffah sent Khazim bin Khizaima to
confront Bassam who lost and escaped. Then Saffah sent Khazim to
Oman to face the Khwarij. He defeated them and killed their chief.
The same year Abu Dawood Khalid bin Ibrahim invaded Kush, killed
its king who was a Dhimmi (Protected non-Muslim subject, this
indicates the treachery of Abu Muslim) and sent his head to Abu

282

The History of Islam

Muslim in Samarkand. He enthroned the king's brother Tazan and
returned to Balkh. At the same time he massacred the civilians of
Bukhara and after making Zeyad bin Saleh the ruler of Bukhara and
Samarkand and ordering the construction of fortifications for
Samarkand, he came back to Merv. After these happenings, Saffah got
the news that Mansoor bin Jamhoor had committed a breach of trust
and revolted. Mansoor bin Jamhoor had been the Governor of Iraq
and Khorasan for two months during the reign of Yazid the Reducer.
He was one of the companions of Abdullah bin Muawiya bin
Abdullah bin ]afar. When Abdullah bin Muawiya was defeated by
Dawood bin Yazid bin Umar bin Hubairah and Ma'an bin Zaidah
near Astakhar, Mansoor bin Jamhoor had fled to Sindh. Abdullah
bin Muawiya re~ched Herat where he was killed by its Governor
Malik bin Haithan Khazi by order of Abu Muslim as related
previously .. Saffah sent his commander of the police Musa bin Kab to
Sindh and deputed Musayab bin Zuhair in his place. Musa and
Mansoor clashed along the Indian border. Mansoor had 12,000
fighters but was defeated. He escaped to the desert and died of
thirst there. Mansoor's Governor who was in Sindh marched
towards the city of Khizr along with the members of his family and
belongings. That same year in Dhul Hijja 134 A.H., Saffah visited
Ambar and made it his capital.
In 135 A.H. Zeyad bin Saleh, Abu Muslim's Governor of Samarkand
and Bukhara, rebelled against him. Abu Muslim left Merv. Abu
Dawood Khalid bin Ibrahim, upon receiving this news, sent Nasr bin
Rashid to Tirmiz (city in southern Uzbekistan) to protect it from
Zeyad. As soon as he reached there, some persons came from Talqan
(Iran bordering the Caspian Sea in the north) and killed him. Abu
Dawood then sent Isa bin Mahan to pursue Nasr's killers. Isa
punished Nasr's -murderers. Meanwhile Abu Muslim arrived at
Amad. He was accompanied by Saba bin Noman Azdi. The caliph
Saffah entrusted the task of murdering Abu Muslim to Zeyad bin
Saleh and Saba bin Noman.
After his a_rrival at Amad, Abu Muslim somehow came to know about
the plot. He at once arrested Saba and giving orders to the Governor
to kill him, left for Bukhara. On the way, he came across some of
Zeyad bin Saleh' s commanders who rebelled against him and were

1

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

283

coming to join Abu Muslim. When Abu Muslim reached Bukhara,
Zeyad hid himself in a local man's house. The local man killed him
and presented his head to Abu Muslim. Abu Muslim informed Abu
Dawood of Zeyad's death. Abu Dawood was engaged at the time on
the expedition at Talqan. After becoming free from this expedition, he
returned to Kush and Isa bin Mahan went to Bassam but without
much success. That same year Isa bin Mahan had sent a few letters to
Abu Muslims' companions criticizing Abu Dawood. Abu Muslim sent
those letters to Abu Dawood. Abu Dawood ·had Isa beaten up and
thrown into captivity. When he was released after a few days, the
soldiers mobbed and killed him. Relieved of this situation, Abu
Muslim returned to Merv.
In 136 A.H., Abdullah bin Ali called on Saffah. He sent him, along
with the troops of Syria and Iraq, to fight the Romans. Saffah' s brother
Abu Jafar Mansoor was the administrator of Jazirah. He made up his
mind to perform Hajj at Saffah's instance submitted a petition of
request asking his permission. Saffah wrote to him, "Come to me and I
shall send you as Amir al-Hajj (leader of the pilgrimage) . So, Mansoor
came to Ambar and Muqatil bin Hakeem was assigned to Harran. The
fact was that Abu Muslim had also sought Saffah' s permission to do
Hajj. So, he secretly informed his own brother Mansoor t~ get ready
for Hajj and send a petition stating his request to come to Hajj, as all
governors were required to do. It is essential to clarify here that Abu
Muslim Khorasani contributed the most to making the propagation of
the Abbasids a success as the previous events have shown. Now
following Saffah' s accession to the caliphate and the strengthening of
the authority of the Abbasids, he was made the governor of Khorasan
and Saffah had sent him the certificate of governorship in his name.
However, Abu Muslim never came to the court in person to take the
oath. When, on behalf of Imam Ibrahim, he was first sent to Khorasan,
he had been living there ever since. He himself conquered Khorasan,
established his government there and dominated over its rule. When
all the enemies were removed, Abdullah bin Saffah thought that it
was best not to transfer Abu Muslim to any other government of the
province nor could he reduce his power.
Abu Muslim considered himself to be the founder of the caliphate of the

284

The History of Islam

Abbasids and the patron of caliph Saffah. Caliph Saffah consulted
him and often acted accordingly but regarding Khorasan, he did not
think it necessary to consult Saffah. Sulaiman bin Katheer was one
of the most famous and oldest of the deputies of the Abbasids. Abu
Muslim killed him on personal grounds and Saffah could not ask
him to explain. Saffah, his uncle and his brother kept overlooking
these excesses but found it difficult to tolerate Abu Muslim's
autocratic method of ruling. When Saffah sent his brother Abu Jafar
Mansoor to Khorasan to take the oath on his behalf and with the
certificate of Abu Muslim's governorship, Abu Muslim's attitude to
Abu Jafar was not courteous and Abu Jafar felt that all his activities
reflected self-conceit and autocracy. That led to an estrangement
between the two and when Abu Jafar briefed Saffah with all that
transpired, Caliph Saffah was all the more concerned and began to
think of ways to reduce Abu Muslim's authority and influence. He
finally decided to do away with him. That was the reasoning behind
why he assigned that job to Zeyad bin Saleh and Saba bin Noman
Azdi as mentioned earlier. In short, they harbored ill feelings and
suspicion in their hearts against each other.
As Abu Muslim was highly courageous and a man who loved power
when he suspected Saffah, he not only thought it necessary to keep his
hold and authority in Khorasan but he also tried to establish his
influence in Hijaz and Iraq in order to crush the Abbasids, if necessary.
It was not surprising that he was preparing to enhance his popularity in
Hijaz, Iraq and all over the Islamic world covertly. He had contributed
most to make the propagation of the Abbasids a success but he forgot
the fact that his adversary was the family, which could produce persons
like Mohammad bin Ali and Ibrahim bin Mohammad, the founders of
the Abbasid movement and they had the ability to ruin the caliphate of
Banu Umayyah. Though Abu Muslim contributed to it most, he was
after all taught and trained by the Abbasids. He sought permission from
Caliph Saffah to perform the Hajj, Saffah permitted him and instructed
him that he should not take more than 500 people with him. Abu
Muslim wrote back, "There are people who are against me. My life
would be in danger if I travel with such a small number." Saffah wrote,
"1000 then should be sufficient for you. Travelling with a large number
of people is inconvenient because managing supplies in Makkah might

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

285

prove to be difficult." Abu Muslim left Merv with 8,000 men and when
he approached the border of Khorasan, he left 7,000 men there and
moved towards the capital Ambar with 1000 men. Saffah sent well
known and respected commanders to receive him. Saffah honored him
royally when he visited the court and said to him. "If my brother Abu
Jafar Mansoor had not intended to perform Hajj, I would have made
you the leader of the pilgrimage, Amir al-Hajj. Thus, his wish to be the
Amir al-Hajj and increase his popularity was thwarted. Abu Jafar
Mansoor and Abu Muslim both left Ambar for Hajj together. Abu
Muslim had left Khorasan with a big treasure and he did not like
Mansoor' s company because he could not do things, which he wanted
to do freely. Nevertheless, he had wells dug to supply water at every
stage of the journey. He started th_e work of building inns and making
more amenities available to the travelers. He distributed clothes, set up
welfare houses, gave away many awards and showed his generosity
with gifts, which endeared him to the masses . In Makkah, he
performed the same acts of generosity on a larger scale where
people from all over the world could witness his kindness. Before
Abu Jafar decided to leave Makkah at the end of the Hajj, Abu
Muslim had left already. Abu Muslim had hardly journeyed two
stages when he came across the messenger from the capital Ambar
who carried the news of Saffah's death and Abu Jafar Mansoor's
succession to the caliphate. The messenger was on way to Abu Jafar
Mansoor. Abu Muslim kept the messenger with him for two days
and then let him go to Mansoor. Abu Jafar Mansoor was unhappy at
Abu Muslim's departure before the proper time. Now he was even
more unhappy at the news including the messengers delay, Abu
Muslim did not congratulate him on his becoming the caliph nor did
he remain encamped to take the oath and continue the journey
together although he was expected to so. When Abu Jafar received
the news, he left Makkah but Abu Muslim kept moving on until he
reached Ambar and after him Mansoor entered the capital.
Abu! Abbas Abdullah Saffah lived as caliph for four years and eight
months and died on 13 Dhul Hijjah 136 A.H. His uncle Isa led the
funeral service and he was buried at Ambar. Before dying, he had
written a testament that Abu Jafar Mansoor and after him, Isa bin
Musa would be caliph. He rolled it in a cloth and put the seal of the

286

The History of Islam

Prophet's family on it and gave it to Isa. Since Mansoor was absent,
Isa bin Musa took the oath from the people as his deputy and sent the
messenger to M~kkah to inform Abu Jafar Mansoor.
Abdullah Saffah made use of money to establish and strengthen his
caliphate in the same way in which the founder of the caliphate of
Banu Umayyah Amir Muawiya ~ had done. Amir Muawiya ~ had
stopped public oppos.ition and support of his opponents the Alawiites
with generosity and succeeded in winning their favor. Similarly, the
Alawiites were claimants for the caliphate against the founder of the
Abbasids, Saffah. T~ey ruined Banu Umayyah in collision with the
Abbasids and once again were disappointed when the caliphate went
to Banu Abbas. Ab~ullah Saffah also gave large sums to the Alawiites
as Amir Muawiya ~ had done. When Saffah was made caliph,
Abdullah bin Hasan Muthanna bin Hasan bin Ali and other Alawiites
came to Kufa and accused them of usurping the caliphate to which
they were entitled . This is the same Abdullah bin Hasan Muthanna
whose son Mohammad was chosen caliph by the Abbasids and the
Alawiites at the meeting in the month of Dhul Hijjah in 131 A.H. All
the people present at that meeting including Abu Jafar Mansoor had
taken the oath for him. Saffah presented one million dirhams to
Abdullah bin Hasan Muthanna though the amount was not available
with him at the time. He had borrowed it from Ibn Muqrin. In the
same way, he gave money to each Alawiite and let them go on their
way. Abdullah bin Hasan Muthanna had hardly left Saffah when a
messenger arrived with the news of Marwan bin Mohammad' s death
with a large amount of precious jewels and ornaments as spoils of
war. Saffah immediately ordered the messenger to take all the jewels
and ornaments and sell them. A trader purchased them from him for
80,000 dinars. If Abdullah bin Saffah had neglected payment to the
Alawiites they would have surely stood up against him and most of
the influential deputies might have joined them making the saving of
their caliphate extremely difficult for the Abbasids. Saffah's greatest
achievement lies in the fact that he silenced all the Alawiites with his
money and did not let them stand against him. Immediately after
Saffah's death, the Alawiites prepared to revolt but by then the
caliphate of the Abbasids had become very powerful.

Abu ]afar Mansoor
Abu Jafar Mansoor Abdullah bin Mohammad bin Ali bin Abdullah
bin Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib' s mother Salameh was a Berber slave
girl. He was born in 95 A.H. while his grandfather was still alive.
According to another narrative, he was born in 101 . A.H. He was
known for his bravery, pride, ability to instill awe, intelligence and
particular point of view. He abhorred sports and fun . He was a great
scholar of literature and the science of applying Islamic law. He
imprisoned Imam Abu Hanifa where he died for his refusal to accept
the post of chief justice. Some say that Abu Hanifa delivered an
authorized legal opinion for bearing arms against Mansoor and
Mansoor had him poisoned to death. Mansoor was a very eloquent
orator. He is accused of greed and miserliness. Abdur Rahman bin
Muawiya bin Hisham bin Abdul Malik Umayyah had become the
ruler of Spain in 138 A.H., during the reign of Mansoor's caliphate.
Since Mansoor was born of a Berber woman, it was said that the
Islamic rule had become part Berber. Ibn Asakir writes that when
Mansoor was wandering through out the Islamic territories in pursuit
of knowledge, he arrived at a place where the guards demanded two
dirhams as tax from him and said, "Unless you pay the tax, you will
not be allowed to stay here." Mansoor said, "I belong to Banu Hashim.
Excuse me. I am one of the sons of the Prophet's * uncle." Even then,
they did not allow him. Mansoor said, "I know the Qur'an. Excuse
me." Again, they did not budge. Mansoor said, "I am a scholar of
Islamic law and the religious obligations." Again, the guard looked
adamant. At last, Mansoor had to part with two dirhams and on that
day, he made up his mind to accumulate -yvealth. Once he instructed
his son Mahdi saying, "A king cannot live without the obedience of
the subjects and the subjects cannot obey without justice. The best man
is he who despite being powerful forgives and the greatest fool is he
who does injustice and oppression. Orders must not be passed
without deliberation for deliberation is a mirror in which a man
observes his own beauty and ugliness. Always be'thankful for Allah's
gifts and blessings, forgive as much as possible, expect obedience
through encouragement and be humble and kind in victory.

288

The History of Islam

The Revolt of Abdullah bin Ali
Abdullah Saffah had sent Mansoor's uncle Abdullah bin Ali to Saifah
with the Khorasani and Syrian armies before his death. In Muharram
137 A.H., Mansoor reached Ambar and became caliph. Isa bin Musa
had informed Abdullah bin Ali about Saffah's death and had written
that Saffah had left a will making Mansoor caliph after him. Abdullah
bin Ali assembled the people and said to them, "When Saffah wanted
to send the army on the Harran expedition, none dared to accept it.
Then he said that whoever went there, would be caliph after him.
Therefore, I went on that expedition and it was I who defeated
Marwan bin , Mohammad and the other Umayyah leaders." All
confirmed his statement and took the oath at his hands. Then
Abdullah bin Ali returned from Dalook, and besieged Muqatil bin
Hakeem at Harran. He continued with the siege for forty days. During
the siege, he became suspicious of the Khorasani men and killed
several of them. He deputed Humaid bin Qahtaba as the governor of
Halab and gave him a letter in the name of Zafar bin Asim, the
governor of Halab and then left. The letter said that as soon as
Humaid arrived he should be put to death. Humaid opened and read
it on the way and turned to Iraq instead of Halab. When Mansoor
arrived in Ambar, Abu Muslim had already arrived there. Abu
Muslim took the oath at Mansoor's hands and Mansoor treated him
with great respect and praise. Meanwhile the news came that
Abdullah bin Ali had rebelled. Mansoor said to Abu Muslim. "I
apprehend great danger from Abdullah bin Ali." Abu Muslim loved
such adventures. He got ready at once in order to oblige Mansoor. He
was deputed to fight against Abdullah bin Ali. Ibn Qahtaba, who
coming to Iraq was displeased with Abdullah bin Ali, joined Abu
Muslim. Abdullah bin Ali gave a pardon to Muqatil bin Hakeem and
he surrendered Harran to Abdullah bin Ali. He sent Muqatil to
Uthman bin Abdul Aala, the governor of Rakka, with a letter. Uthman
killed him as soon as he reached him and arrested both his sons. After
seeing, Abu Muslim had off, Mansoor sent for Mohammad bin Sul
from Azerbaijan and dispatched him to deceive Abdullah bin Ali witl
a fabricated story. Mohammad bin Sul called on Abdullah bin Ali an
said to him, "I have heard Saffah say that after his death his successo

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

289

would be his uncle Abdullah." Abdullah bin Ali said, "You are a liar
and I understand your fraud." Saying this he chopped off his head.
Then he left Harran and stayed at Nasiban where he dug trenches and
made fortifications. Before sending Abu Muslim, Mansoor had
already written to Hasan bin Qahtaba, the governor of Armenia, to
come and join Abu Muslim and he joined him at Mousil. When Abu
Muslim and his army arrived at Nasiban, he camped in the direction
of Syria and made it known that he had nothing to do with Abdullah
bin Ali and that he had been made the governor of Syria and was on
his way there. Abdullah bin Ali's men who were Syrians were
nervous when they heard this. They said to Abdullah bin Ali, "Our
families will come under the wheel-of his tyranny. We better stop him
from going to Syria." Abdullah bin Ali tried his utmost to argue with
them that Abu Muslim had come to fight with them and that he
would not go to Syria but no one believed him. At last, he left the
camp and was on the way to Syria when Abu Muslim at once shifted
to Abdullah bin Ali's camp which was more strategically located and
Abdullah bin Ali had to camp where Abu Muslim had been ca,mped.
Thus, Abu Muslim secured a more strategic position. Then both the
armies clashed, which continued for several months. Finally, on
Wednesday 7 Jumad-al-Thani 137 A.H. Abdullah bin Ali was defeated
and Abu Muslim was vjctorious, he immediately sent the news to
Mansoor. Abdullah bin Alt fled and took refuge with his brother
Sulaiman bin Ali in Basra and remained there in hiding.

Death of Abu Muslim
When Mansoor heard that Abdullah bin Ali was defeated and Abu
Muslim looted his camp and took a large amount of spoils of war, he
sent his servant Abu Khaseeb to record the valuables. Abu Muslim
was annoyed that Mansoor did not rely upon him and sent his own
men for the purpose of accounting. When Mansoor was informed of
Abu Muslim' s displeasure, he felt concerned that he might go to
Khorasan. So, he ·wrote a certificate of governorship of Syria and
Egypt in Abu Muslim's name and sent it to him: Abu Muslim was
aggrieved from this even more and he thought that he was being
separated from Khorasan in order to make him · helpless and
powerless. So, he left Jazirah and went to Khorasan. When he found

290

The History of Islam

out about Abu Muslim's movement, Mansoor left Ambar and went to
Maclain and sent for him. Abu Muslim refused to come to him, saying,
"I shall obey you from a distance. I have subdued all your enemies.
Now that all your dangers are over you do not need me. If you leave
me alone, I shall keep obeying you and shall remain committed to my
oath. But if you pursue me, I shall announce the cancellation of the
oath and oppose you." After going through the letter Mansoor wrote
to Abu Muslim very softly and affectionately, "I have no doubts about
your loyalty and obedience. You are very efficient and worthy of
reward. The devil has poured poison of suspicion into your heart.
Purge yourself of all these suspicions and temptations and come over
to me." Mansoor dispatched the letter through his liberated slave Abu
Humaid and instructed him to induce and entreat him to visit
Mansoor and threaten him with Mansoor's anger in case of refusal.
When the letter reached him, he consulted Malik bin Haitham. He
said, "Don't go to Mansoor. He will kill you." But Mansoor had
already persuaded Abu Dawood Khalid bin Ibrahim in exchange for
the governorship of Khorasan to convince Abu Muslim to come to him
at any cost. Due to Abu Dawood's advice Abu Muslim prepared
himself to go to Mansoor. Despite this he took precautions by first
sending his minister Abu Ishaq Khalid bin Uthman to Mansoor to get
more acquainted with the conditions and situation there. Abu Muslim
had a deep trust in Abu Ishaq. When he reached the caliph's court, all
the leaders of Banu Hashim and noblemen of the court came to receive
him. Mansoor treated him with great respect and love and won his
heart with his soft speech, then he said to him, "Prevent Abu Muslim
from going to Khorasan and convince him to come to me. In exchange
I shall give you the governorship of Khorasan." Abu Ishaq yielded. He
came to Abu Muslim and persuaded him to visit Mansoor. So, he left
his army under the command of Malik bin Haitham at Hal wan and
with 3,000 men moved to Maclain. When he reached Maclain, a man
visited him at Mansoor's instance and said to him, "Please
recommend me to Mansoor and ask him to give me the governorship
of Kaskar (in the Northwest Frontier Province of present day
Pakistan). Also, Mansoor is very displeased with his minister Abu
A yyub. Please say a few words in his favor." Abu Muslim was
pleased to oblige him and all doubts about danger that he harbored in

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

291

his heart vanished. He entered the court with honor and went back to
his resting place with equal honor. When he visited the court the next
day, Mansoor had already hidden Uthrnan bin Naheek, Shabeeb bin
Rawah, Harb bin Qais and others, behind a veil and instructed them
that when he clapped, they should come out and kill him. Abu
Muslim came to the court and Caliph Mansoor in the course of
conversation inquired of him about the two swords he had taken from
Abdullah bin Ali. Abu Muslim had one of those two swords at his
side. He at once handed it over to Mansoor. He kept looking at it for a
while and then he put it under his thigh and began to complain to
Abu Muslim about his actions then he mentioned the death of
Sulaiman bin Katheer and said to him, "Why did you kill him though
he has been loyal to me since before you had joined this work." First
Abu Muslim offered excuses in a humble and flattering manner but
when he found that Mansoor' s rage was rising moment by moment
and that he was no longer secure he courageously answered, "Do
what you may. I fear none except Allah." Mansoor abused Abu
Muslim and clapped his hands. On hearing the clapping Uthman bin
Naheek and the others came out and killed him.
This occurred in 25 SHibban 137 A.H. After Abu Muslim's death, the
minister went out and sent back Abu Muslim's men saying, "Your
Amir will remain with the Amir al-Muminin at present. You may go
back." Then Isa bin Musa came to the caliph's court and inquired
about Abu Muslim. When he understood he was dead, he exclaimed
J ~ \J o..)l Lll J 1 Ll). This touched Mansoor and he said, "No one was a
greater enemy to you than Abu Muslim." Then Mansoor sent for Jafar
bin· Hanzla and consulted him about killing Abu Muslim. Jafar
advised him to kill him and Mansoor said, "May Allah give you a
good reward!" and then pointed to the dead body of Abu Muslim. As
soon as he saw it he said, "Amir al-Muminin you are caliph with effect
from today." Mansoor simply smiled and kept quite.
Abu Nasr Malik bin Haitham to whom Abu Muslim had handed over
his wealth, left Hal wan and was on his way to Khorasan planning on
going to Hamadan. Then he came back to Mansoor. Mansoor
reprimanded him, saying, "You advised Abu Muslim not to come to
me." He said, "As long as I was with him, I gave advice. Now that I

292

The History of Islam

have come to you, I shall keep trying to do good for you." Mansoor
sent him as the ruler of Mousil.

The Revolt of Sinbad
After becoming free from the matter of Abu Muslim, Mansoor
obviously could relax to some degree but even after that, he had to
face many difficulties. Among Abu Muslim's men there was a
Zoroastrian named Firoz who was popularly known as Sinbad . He
had converted Islam and joined Abu Muslim's army. Following Abu
Muslim's murder, he rose up and demanded compensation for his
murder. The inhabitants of mountain area supported him. He
conquered Nishapur and Rayy and took possession of all the money
and provisions that Abu Muslim had left there. He looted the people's
wealth and goods and made them slaves. Then he turned apostate and
announced that he was going to pull down the Ka'bah. For the new
Iranian Muslims this much instigation was sufficient and those who
knew nothing about Islam saw one of their countrymen revolt against
the Islamic authority and they joined him. When Mansoor was
informed of this new evil, he sent Jamhoor bin Murar Ajli to punish
Sinbad . They clashed at a place between Hamadan and Rayy. Jamhoor
defeated Sinbad and about 7,000 of Sinbad's men lost their lives.
Sinbad fled and took refuge in Tabristan. A servant of the governor of
Tabristan killed him. Mansoor wrote to the governor of Tabristan to
send Sinbad's wealth and goods but he refused. Mansoor then sent an
army to discipline him. He fled from Tabristan and went to Dailam.
When Jamhoor had defeated Sinbad, he captured most of his goods
and all his treasure and Abu Muslim's treasure aliio came under his
possession. He did no.t. SE;nd it to Mansoor. He went to Rayy, entered
the fort and announced his cancellation of his oath to Mansoor and
rebelled against him. Mansoor sent Mohammad bin Ash'th to fight
against him. Jamhoor left Rayy and went to Isfahan. Jamhoor
conquered Isfahan and Mohammad bin Ash'th occupied Rayy. Then
Mohammad invaded Isfahan. Jamhoor fought but lost after a pitched
battle and fled to Azerbaijan. A friend of Jamhoor's killed him and
sent his head to Mansoor. This happened in 138 A.H.
In

139

A.H., Mansoor deposed his uncle Sulaiman from the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

293

governorship of Basra and recalled him. He wrote to him to bring
Abdullah bin Ali (who after losing to Abu Muslim, had gone to his
brother Sulaiman in Basra) with him by giving him a pardon. When
he brought Abdullah bin Ali to court, Mansoor imprisoned him and
later on killed him.

The sect of Ravindiyeh
Ravandiyeh is considered as one of the sects of the Shiites. It was in
fact a sect consisting of the ignorant people of Iran and Khorasan,
which lived in Ravaind. It originated from recruits of Abu Muslim's
army. The sect, which he had made, had nothing to do with religion
and they were always guided by political considerations. The
Ravaindiyeh believed in transmigration and embodiment. They
believed that Mansoor was the embodiment of Allah. So they took him
to be Allah and to obtain a sight of him amounted to worship. It was
their belief that Adam's soul entered Uthman bin Naheek's body and
the angel Gabriel's soul entered Haitham bin Muawiya's body. They
visited the capital and made public their faith and deeds. Mansoor
caught 200 of them besides those, there were 500 or 600 more. They
reacted to the arrest of their co-religionists, stormed the jaiLand freed
their brethren. Then they besieged Mansoor's palace. It is really
surprising that they considered Mansoor to be their god and yet they
were ready to fight with him. It is worth recording here that among
Yazid bin Hubairah's friends Ma'an bin Zaidah was still alive. And
when lbn Hubariah fought with the Abbasids, Ma' an bin Zaidah was
among his leaders. Ma' an bin Zaidah went into hiding in the capital of
Hashimites after Ibn Hubairah's defeat, Mansoor had been searching
for him and wanted to have him arrested and killed. When the
Ravandiyehs surrounded Mansoor's palace, Mansoor came out on
foot. He started attacking and removing them although he had only a
small number of men with him. In the capital there was no army or
other power to match the rioters' strength. It was a very critical
moment for Mansoor. He was on the point of losing the capital, the
caliphate and his life and opening the way for occupation by the
Ravandiyahs. Ma' an bin Zaidah, taking advantage of the situation,
came to his defense unhesitatingly and fell upon the rioters.
Meanwhile others also rallied around Mansoor but it-was Ma'an bin

294

The History of Islam

Zaidah's attacks that proved most effective. Mansoor watched with
his own eyes the heroic deeds of the stranger. At last, Ma' an bin
Zaidah himself began to command the men that ultimately led to the
defeat of the rioters. Other civilians also rose in support of Mansoor
and did away with all the rioters. After the battle, Mansoor made
inquires about the stranger who had done the most to stamp out the
evil disorder. He was informed that it was none other than Ma'an bin
Zaidah. He granted him pardon excused his past crimes and
promoted him to a higher rank.
Abu Dawood Khalid bin Ibrahim Dhahli was the administrator of
Balkh and the new governor of Khorasan. In 140 A.H. a rebellion
broke out in his army and the soldiers surrounded his house. He
climbed on the roof to have a look at the rebels. He slipped, fell and
died the same day. After that his commander Hosam put down the
rebellion, took over the reign of Khorasan and informed Mansoor who
sent Abdul Jabbar bin Abdur Rahman as the governor of Khorasan.

Abdul Jabbar's Revolt and Death
Immediately after taking over the reign of Khorasan, Abdul Jabbar
began to depose, humiliate ~;d kill Abu Dawood' s administrators. He
created a commotion in the country by slaying his leaders on the
slightest suspicions. Mansoor found out that Abdul Jabbar was killing
the supporters of the Abbasids but he was hesitant how to make
Abdul Jabbar leave Khorasan for he feared he might revolt against
him. At last, Mansoor wrote to him, "Send the majority of the army for
jihad against the Romans." The purpose was quite obvious. When a
greater portion of the army was separated from Khorasan, it would be
quite easy to depose and replace him with another man. Abdul Jabbar
wrote back in reply, "The Turks have begun to attack. If you shift the
army to any other place than Khorasan, I am afraid, Khorasan will go
out of our hands." At the receipt of the reply Mansoor wrote to him, "I
love Khorasan most. It is very essential to protect it. If the Turks have
started invading, I will send a huge army for its defense. Don't worry
about it." Seeing the letter, Abdul Jabbar immediately sent the reply,
"The revenue of Khorasan can not stand such a major expense. Please
don't send any large army." This reply convinced Mansoor that Abdul

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

295

Jabbar was bent upon revolt. So immediately he sent a large army
under the command of his son Mahdi. Mahdi arrived at Rayy and
asked Khazim bin Khuzaima to go ahead and fight with Abdul Jabbar.
There was a fierce battle resulting in Abdul Jabbar' s defeat and flight.
Mahshar bin Muzahim captured and presented him to Khazim bin
Khuzaima who, in turn, made him put on a woolen gown and sit on a
camel with his face towards its tail and after making a public display
of him, sent him and all his men to Mansoor. Mansoor jailed them and
in 142 A.H. ordered Abdul Jabbar's hands and feet to be cut off. After
defeating Abdul Jabbar, Mahdi took over the reign of Khorasan and
continued in the capacity of its governor until 149 A.H.

Uyainah bin Musa bin Kab
Musa bin Kab was the administrator of Sindh and after him his son
Uyaimah succeeded him as the governor of Sindh. He revolted against
Mansoor. When Mansoor found out, he left the capital and went to
Basra, and from there he gave the certificate of the governorship of
Sindh and India to Omar bin Hafs bin Abi Safwah Atki and appointed
him for the expedition against Uyaimah. Omar bin Hafs arrived in
Sindh and declared war against Uyaimah and ultimately captured
Sindh in 142 A.H. In the meantime, the administrator of Tabristan also
rebelled. Khazim bin Khuzaima and Ruh bin Hatim were sent there.
They conquered it and its administrator, a new Iranian Muslim,
committed suicide.

The arrest and captivity of the Alawiites
It has already been mentioned that during the end of the caliphate of
Banu Umayyah an assembly was held in Makkah which discussed the
nomination and election of the new caliph. Mansoor who was also
present there voted for Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Hasan
Muthanna bin Hasan bin Ali. All were unanimous on this point and
took the oath at Mohammad bin Abdullah's hands. Mansoor also took
the oath for him. Saffah kept the Alawiites quiet during his reign by
giving them gifts and cash and thus preventing them from revolting.
When Mansoor took over as caliph, he did not let the generosity of
Saffah' s times continue and constantly thought of Mohammad bin

296

The History of Islam

.Abdullah. Mohammad bin Abdullah's father Abdullah bin Hasan has
also found mention above. He visited Saffah who gave him a large
sum of money and sent him away. When Mansoor became caliph,
Abdullah bin Hasan hid his sons Mohammad and Ibrahim so that
Mansoor would not kill them. Mohammad bin Abdullah who
Mansoor took the oath for was also known as Mohammad Mahdi. He
will be referred to in the following as Mohammad Mahdi. When
Mansoo.r went on Hajj in 136 A.H. and heard the news of Saffah's
death, he first made queries about Mohammad Mahdi . He was not
present there at the time. The people were suspicious of him and so he
and his brother Ibrahim went into hiding. After becoming caliph,
Mansoor always was trying to find out where he was. He made so
many inquiries about him that everybody knew that he wanted
Mohammad Mahdi badly. When Abdullah bin Hasan Mutha1ma was
pressurized to make his sons appear, he consulted Mansoor's uncle
Sulaiman bin Ali. Sulaiman said that if Mansoor had been accustomed
to granting forgiveness, he would have forgiven his uncle and he
would not have let atrocities be perpetrated upon him. Hearing this
Abdullah bin Hasan became all the more careful in keeping his sons in
hiding. At last, Mansoor spread his spies throughout the Hijaz and
had fake letters sent to Abdullah bin Hasan in order to find out
Mohammad Mahdi's whereabouts. Mohammad Mahdi and his
brother Ibrahim continued. to remain in hiding in the Hijaz. Mansoor
went for Hajj but was actually looking for them. Both brothers left the
Hijaz and went to Basra and stayed with Banu Rahib and Banu
Murrah. When Mansoor found out about that, he went to Basra
immediately. However, they had left Basra before he arrived there.
From Basra, they went to Aden and Mansoor left for the capital. When
the two brothers could not find peace even in Aden, they went to
Sindh. After living for a short time in Sindh, they went to Kufa and
started hiding again. Afterwards, they went to Madinah. Mansoor
again went to Hajj in 140 A.H. The two brothers also visited Makkah
for Hajj. Ibrahim wanted to kill Mansoor but his brother Mohammad
Mahdi forbade him to do so. This time Mansoor failed to find them
again. He called their father to him and forced him to bring them into
his presence. When he expressed his ignorance of where they were,
Mansoor wanted to imprison him but on the guarantee of the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

297

administrator of Madinah, Zeyad, he was let off. Because Zeyad made
the guarantee for him, Mansoor came to harbor ill feelings against him
also. After coming to the capital he appointed Mohammad bin Khalid
bin Abdullah Qasri as the administrator of Madinah and brought
Zeyad and his friends back to the capital and arrested them and put
them into prison. After taking over as the administrator of Madinah,
Mohammad bin Khalid tried his best to find Mohammad Mahdi and
spent all the money of the treasury on it. Mansoor deposed
Mohammad binAKhalid for his extravagance and failure and replaced
him with Rabah bin Uthman bin Hayyan Muzani. Rabah reached
Madinah and harassed Abdullah bin Hasan and created a great
commotion there and arrested and imprisoned the following
Alawiites.
1. Abdullah bin Hasan Muthanna bin Ali ~ (Mohammad Mahdi's

father)
2. Ibrahim bin Hasan Muthanna bin Hasan bin Ali~ (Mohammad
Mahdi's uncle)
3. Jafar bin Hasan Muthanna bin Hasan bin Ali ~ (Mohammad

11. Ali bin Hasan bin Hasan bin Ali~ (Mohammad Mahdi's uncle)
When Mansoor was informed of their arrest, he wrote back that
along with them Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Amr bin Uthman bin
Affan should also be arrested because Abdullah bin Hasan bin
Hasan bin Ali's mother was also from the same line of Fatima bint
Husain's children. Rabah complied with this order and imprisoned
Muhammad bin Abdullah bin Amr. It was during this period that
the Egyptian governor arrested Ali bin Mohammad bin Abdullah
bin Hasan bin Hasan bin Ali ~ (Mohammad Mahdi's son) and sent
him to Mansoor. Mansoor put him in prison. His father had sent him
to Egypt for propagation and informing the people about their
ideals and beliefs.

Building of Baghdad and Compilation of Knowledge
Saffah had made Ambar his capital and after a short time he had his
palace and buildings for his government officials constructed adjacent
to Ambar. This was a new colony and it was named Hashmia.
Mansoor was at Hashmia when the commotion in Khorasan was
going on. In 140 A.H., he wanted to build a separate capital and the
foundation of the city of Baghdad was laid. The construction work
continued for nine or ten years and was completed in 149 A.H. From
that time on Baghdad was the capital of the Abbasids. During the
same period, the scholars began the work of foundation and
compilation of religious knowledge. lbn Jareeh in Makkah, Malik(.....- J
11) in Madina, lbn Abi Aruba (11 .....- J) and Hammad bin Sulamih in
Basra, Mamar (11 .....-J) in Yemen, and Sufyan Thauri (..111 .....-J) in Kufa
began the work of compiling the Hadith (the traditions of the
Prophet) . lbn Ishaq (11 .....-J) and Abu Hanifa (11 .....-J) wrote books on
the military expeditions of the Prophet and Islamic law respectively.
Prior to that, the traditions and the expeditions of the Prophet were
based on verbal narration. This chain of writing and compilation went
on developing and the courts of Baghdad and Cordova, Spain
patronized the authors to the maximum. It was the most suitable time
for writing the books of Hadith and having the enormous amount of
material carried by memory written on paper.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

299

The killing of the Sadat
The elders whom Rabah had arrested and imprisoned remained
incarcerated in Madinah until the end of 144 A.H. Mansoor was
constantly in search of Mohammad Mahdi and his brother Ibrahim.
During this period, the brothers remained in hiding among the tribes
of the Hijaz and in unknown places. They kept changing their hiding
places. All of the descendants of Hasan bin Ali ~ were either
imprisoned or in hiding. In Dhul Hijja 144 A.H. Mansoor went to Hajj
and sent Mohammad bin Imran bin Ibrahim bin Talha and Malik bin
Anas to the descendants of Hasan ~ who were in prison with a
message asking them to hand over Mohammad and Ibrahim to
Mansoor. Their father Abdullah bin Hasan Muthanna bin Hasan
pleaded ignorance about them and sought his permission to appear
before the caliph. Mansoor said," As long as Abdullah bin Hasan does
not bring his sons into my presence, I will not see him." When
Mansoor was coming to Iraq on his return journey from Hajj, he
ordered Rabah to send the captives to him in Iraq. Rabah took all the
captives yoked, handcuffed and chained and then put them on camels
without saddles and sent them off to Iraq under escort. Mohammad
and Ibrahim, disguised as Bedouins, met their father on the way and
sought his permission to rebel. But Abdullah bin Hasan exhorted and
instructed them to be patient and not to be hasty. When those captives
were ushered into Mansoor' s presence, he called Mohammad bin
Abdullah bin Amr bin Uthman to come before him, he abused him
and gave him 150 lashes. Mansoor was hostile to him because the
Syrians were his supporters and he commanded great respect there.
When the prisoners were shifted to Iraq, Mohammad Mahdi sent his
brother Ibrahim to Iraq and Khorasan to propagate to the people there
and to instigate them to oppose the Abbasids. Mansoor was sure of
Mahdi's presence in the Hijaz. One of the strategies he adopted to
deceive and trace him was that he used to have letters written
constantly and sent them to those inhabitants of different cities who he
supposed were Mahdi's supporters and might know his whereabouts.
Those letters contained tributes to Mahdi and criticism of Mansoor
and his shortcoming and inducements to rebellion. By these actions,

300

The History of Islam

he thought that one of his spies might get access to Mohammad
Mahdi and arrest him. He did not succeed in his aim and Mohammad
Mahdi continued to get information about the letters from his friends.
He could not accurately gage the strength of his supporters and
followers and he overestimated his following. His brother Ibrahim
traveled through Basra, Kerman, Isfahan, Khorasan, Mousil and Syria,
and enlisted missionaries and sympathizers. He came to the capital, ate
with Mansoor and the latter failed to recognize him. The next time
Mansoor came to inspect the construction of Baghdad, Mohammad
Mahdi was present there among Mansoor' s men. His spies informed
him that Ibrahim was present there but he could not find and arrest him.
In the same way, despite his best efforts to locate him in Hijaz, Rabah
failed to catch him. At last, Abu Aun, the Administrator of Khorasan
sent a letter to Mansoor in 145 A.H. that secret conspiracies were on
the increase there and all the Khorasanis were awaiting a revolt by
Mohammad Mahdi. As soon as he read it, he sent for Mohammad bin
Abdullah bin Amr bin Uthman from the jail, handed him over to the
executioner and had his head chopped off and sent it to Khorasan.
Along with it, he sent a few persons who swore as witnesses that the
head belonged to Mohammad bin Abdullah and his grand mother
was Fatima bint Mohammad ~ - In this way the Khorasanis were
fraudulently led to believe that Mohammad Mahdi was put to death
and that it · was his head. Then he enclosed Mohammad bin Ibrahim
Mahdi's cousin, alive in a pillar of the construction. Then Abdullah
bin Hasan bin Hasan bin Ali, Mahdi's father, and Ali bin Hasan bin
Hasan bin Ali, Mahdi's uncle, were killed. Then Ibrahim bin Hasan
bin Hasan bin Ali, Mahdi's uncle, and Abbas bin Hasan bin Hasan bin
Ali, Mahdi's cousin, were tortured to death. Mansoor' s stoneheartedness is very shocking. Banu Umayyah were opponents and
enemies of the Alawiites and the Abbasids were extremely intimate
and allies with the Alawiites. Banu Umayyah did not bear any close
relation with the Alawiites. But they had very close relations with the
Abbasids. The Alawiites vehemently opposed Banu Umayyah and
frequently used arrows and swords against them but they did not
fight with the Banu Abbas. Taking all these things into consideration
and reflecting on the fact that Banu Umayyah never arrested and
killed any Alawiite on mere suspicion and the only Alawiites that

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

301

were slain by them were those who fought against them on the
battlefield we can consider being an enemy of the Umayyahs was
safer than being an ally of the Abbasids. Mansoor killed many
innocent descendants of Hasan ~ mercilessly. Yazid bin Muawiya's
killing of Husain~ pales into insignificance if we look at the murders
of the Sadat (members of the Prophet's family) in respect to the
number of crimes committed. Perhaps this is only an indication of the
blind lust man has for this world, which can make an intelligent man
act like a murderer, to achieve what he wants.

The Revolt of Mohammad Mahdi N11Fse
Z3ki3b (the pure soul)
When Mansoor had Abdullah bin Hasan and other descendants of
Hasan ~ killed, Mohammad Mahdi, after hearing of it, did not think it
honorable to wait any longer. He was confident that the masses would
support him and cancel their oaths to Mansoor. He consulted his
friends in Madinah concerning the revolt. On the day of the revolt by
chance, the administrator of Madinah, Rabah had been informed by
his spies that Mohammad Mahdi was going to revolt on that day. He
sent for Jafar bin Mohammad bin Husain and Husain bin Ali bin
Husain and a few of the Quraish and said to them, "If Mohammad
Mahdi rebels, I shall kill you." As the talk was going on, they heard
the call of Allahu Akbar (God is the Greatest) and they immediately
knew that Mohammad Mahdi had revolted. In the beginning, he had
only 150 supporters. He first went to the jail and freed Mohammad
bin Khalid bin Abdullah Qasri and his nephew Nazir bin Yazid bin
Khalid and the others were was locked up with them. Then he went to
the Governor's headquarter and arrested Ra bah and his brother Abbas
and Ibn Muslim bin Oqba. Then he came to the mosque and delivered
a sermon in which he highlighted Mansoor's bad habits and his
criminal activities and promised to do justice with the people and
asked for their co-operation.
After that he deputed Uthman bin Mohammad bin Khalid bin Zuhair
to the post of chief justice, Abdul Aziz bin Muttalib bin Abdullah
Makhzumi to the arsenal, Uthman bin Obaidullah bin Abdullah bin
Omar bin Khattab to the post of chief of police. He then sent a

!

,I

302

representative with a message to Mohammad bin Abdul Aziz asking
him why he sat inside the house hidden. Mohammad bin Abdul Aziz
promised to extend co-operation to him. Ismail bin Abdullah bin Jafar
did not take the oath for Mohammad Mahdi. A few others also
evaded the oath. Mansoor received the news nine days after the
rebellion of Mohammad Mahdi and the imprisonment of Rabah. He
was extremely worried and he rushed to Kufa and sent a letter as a
promise of amnesty in the name of Mohammad Mahdi . He wrote as
follows:

In the Name of Allah, The Most gracious, The Most Merciful.
The recompense of those who wage war against Allah and His
Messenger and do mischief in the land is only that they shall be
killed or crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off from
opposite sides, or be exiled from the land. That is their disgrace
in this world, and a great torment is theirs in the Hereafter.
Except for those who (having fled away and then) came back
(as Muslims) with repentance before they fall into your power;
in that case, k1tow that Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
(Q. 5:33-34)
In between, you and me stand Allah and His Prophet's contract and
obligation. I give you safety and pardon for yourself, your family and
your followers in respect of life, money and goods. Furthermore,
whatever blood you have shed or people's money you have usurped,
you are forgiven. I grant you 100,000 dirhams additional. Besides
these things, all your wants will be met and your wishes fulfilled . You
will be allowed to live in the city you like. Those of your followers
who are once granted safety and pardon will never be charged or

punished. If you want to be satisfied on these points, you may send
your agent to me and have a contract written by me and be confident
in all respects."
When the letter was received by Mohammad Mahdi, he wrote in

These are the Verses of the manifest Book (that makes clear
truth from falsehood, good from evil).
We recite to you some of the news of Musa (Moses) and Fir'aun
(Pharaoh) in truth, for a people who believe (in this Qur'an, and
in the Oneness of Allah).
Verily, Fir' aun (Pharaoh) exalted himself in the land and made
its people sects, weakening (oppressing) a group (i.e. Children
of Israel) among them: killing their sons, and letting their
females live. Verily, he was of the Mufsidun (i.e. those who
commit great sins and crimes, oppressors, tyrants).
And We wished to do a favor to those who were weak (and
oppressed) in the land, and to make them rulers and to make
them the inheritors,
And to establish them in the land, and We let Fir' aun (Pharaoh)
and Haman and their hosts receive from them that which they
feared . (28:1-6)
We grant you the same sort of 'aman', (safety) which you have offered
to me. The fact is that the government is our privilege and your claim
to it is due to us and you went out as one of our groups to secure the
government and met with success. Our father Ali bin Abi Talib 4' was
the Imam and heir. How did you become heir to his authority in the

304

The History of Islam

presence of his descendants? You also know that we, the noble and of
pure blood, never ran after the government. We are not the sons of
those accused and turned out. None among Banu Hashim is equal to
us in relation, priority and greatness. We are from the descendants of
Fatima bint Amr in the age of Ignorance. In Islam we descend from
Fatima bint Mohammad~- Allah has made us higher and better than
you. Among the Prophets our father, Mohammad ~ is the greatest of
all and among the predecessors, there is Ali bin Abi Talib ~ who was
the first to embrace Islam. Among the impeccable wives, Khadija was
the first to perform her Salat (prayer). Among the girls is Fatima, the
Prophet's daughter, who is superior to all the women of the world.
Among the children are Hasan~ and Husain ~ who are the leaders
of those who will go to Paradise. Hashim bears dual relation with Ali
bin Abi Talib ~ and Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib ~ is similarly doubly
connected with Abdul Muttalib. I am a superior Banu Hashim in
terms of purity of blood . My father is well known among Banu
Hashim. I have no mixed blood of non-Arabs nor do I have the mark
of a slave-girl. I make Allah stand witness between you and me and
say that if you obey me I grant you safety and pardon for your life and
property and forgive you of all your misdeeds and crimes you have
committed. But I will not be responsible for a specific judgment set out
by Allah or any Muslim's right or contract because in this respect, as
you know, I am quite helpless. Undoubtedly, I deserve the caliphate
more them you and I am a better keeper of promises. You granted
safety and pardon and your word to some persons before me. So,
what type of safety and pardon do you grant me, the safety and
pardon granted to Ibn Hubairah, or to your uncle Abdullah bin Ali or
to Abu Muslim?
Upon receiving the letter, Mansoor twisted with anger and
discomfort. He then wrote the following letter and dispatched it to
Mohammad Mahdi:
I read your letter. Your pride is based on the proximity of women,
which can deceive only the ignorant people of the market. Allah has
not created women equivalent to uncles, fathers and guardians. He
has made the uncle the deputy of the father and given priority to the
nearest mother in His Book. Had he respected the relation of women,
Amina [the Prophet's ~ mother] would have been the leader of the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

305

people of Paradise. Allah made those greater in rank whom He liked.
As for your mention of Fatima Umm Abi Talib, it can be said that
Allah did not let any of her sons or daughters embrace Islam. Had He
chosen from among the men on the basis of relation, He would have
chosen Abdullah bin Abdul Muttalib and he was no doubt better in all
respects. But Allah chose for the sake of His religion whom He liked.
He says:

(r-/:+'.J~ ~r -;.-_, :~:;. (?~ JJ, ~-_, :- ::;..r:;. (?/4.; 'J ~!)
Verily, you (0 Muhammad ~) guide not whom you like, but
Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are
the guided. (Q.28:56)
When Allah sent the Prophet ~ , his four uncles were living. He
revealed the verse.

And warn your tribe (0 Muhammad ~) of near kindred.
(Q.26:214).
So, he made them fear Allah's punishment and invited them to the
true religion. Two of the four accepted the true religion and my father
was one of them. The other two refused to accept the true religion and
one of them was your father (Abu Talib). So, Allah severed their chain
of authority and the Prophet ~ did not allow any relation and
inheritance between the two parties of believers and non-believers.
You have written about Hasan 4,; that he bears a double relation with
Abdul Muttalib and then that you have the same double relation with
the Prophet~- My reply is this that the Prophet~ is Khairul Awwaleenwal-Akhreen the best of the first and the last. He had paternal relations
with Banu Hashim and Abdul Muttalib. You think that you are the
best among the Banu Hashim and your parents enjoyed a better
reputation and you have no mixture of non-Arab blood nor a trace of
a slave-girl in your line. I see that you have made yourself as a matter
of pride better than the entire tribe of Banu Hashim. Think a little.
How can we not disapprove of your words? How will you answer
Allah tomorrow? You have crossed the limits and declared yourself
better than those who are far superior to you in person and traits, that

306

The History of Islam

is, Ibrahim the Prophet ~- No one from amongst the descendants of
your father is better and none of them became great except the sons of
slave-girls. After the Prophet's ~ death none among you was born
better and greater than Ali bin Husain (Imam Zainul Abdeen) and he
is superior to the slave-girl's sons and they were undoubtedly better
than your grandfather Hasan bin Hasan. After him no one among you
was born like Mohammad bin Ali. His grandmother was a slave-girl
and she is better than your father. His son Jafar is better than you and
his grandmother was a slave-girl. Your statement that you are the sons
of the Prophet ~ is wrong. Allah says in his Book,
( ~b;-J ::,,. ~i 4! ~ 0l5 t:.)

Muhammad (~ ) .,is not the fath,~r of any of your men, but he is
the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets. And
Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything. (Q. 33:40)
Yes, you are the son of the Prophet's daughter and undoubtedly this
relation is close but it is not entitled to inheritance nor can it be a heir
to authority nor is leadership legally theirs. So how can you be an heir
by yirtue of this relationship? Your father wanted it most. He made
Fatima l+--:,.- .'iii ...,-----:.; come out in the light of day, concealing her illness
and buried her at night but the people did not recognize anyone but
the sheikhain (two sheiks, Abu Bakr ~ and Umar -'*·)
[Editor's Note: He is insinuating unjustly that Ali 4 brought his wife
out to be seen by people because it would influence them to choose
him as the Caliph because of his close connection to the Prophet ~
through his daughter and he buried her secretly so that the loss of this
connection would not be established in the peoples mind. He goes on
to insinuate that in spite of these efforts the people chose Abu Bakr
and Umar over him.]
All the Muslims are unanimous on the point that the maternal
grandfather, maternal uncle and mother's sister cannot be heirs. Next,
you are proud of Ali's conversion to Islam before others. The answer
to that is that the Prophet ~ at the time of his death, ordered
somebody else to lead the Sa/at (prayer) and afterwards the people
continued to make others the leader and Caliph one after the other

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

307

and did not pick or choose him although he was also one of the six
persons from among those who the Caliph was chosen. The people
took him to be a misfit for this job and spared him and did not
consider him to be entitled to it. Abdur Rahman preferred Uthman ~
to him and he is an accused in the matter. (Editor: Insinuating unjustly
that he was involved in the murder of Uthman ~ -) Talha ~ and
Zuhair ~ fought him and Sa' d ~ refused to take oath for him.
Afterwards he took the oath for Muawiya's 4,,. Then your father again
wished to be caliph and fought . His friends parted with him. His
supporters became suspicious as to his right to be ruler and judge and
then they unanimously fixed two persons to decide the matter. Both of
those chosen agreed on his dismissal (Editor: He is selectively
applying the facts, please refer back to the Vol. I concerning Amr bin
Aas and Musa Ashari's judgment concerning Muawiya 4,, and Ali 4,,).
Then Hasan 4J;, became caliph and he sold out the caliphate to
Muawiya ~ for clothes and money and presented his supporters to
Muawiya 4,, and entrusted the leadership to the incapable (Editor: He
means your family sold the caliphate to Banu Umayyah). So, even if
you were entitled to it, you have already sold it and received its price.
Then your uncle Husain 4J;, rebelled against lbn Marjanah (lbn Zeyad).
The people joined Ibn Zeyad against your uncle to such an extent that
they killed your uncle, cut off his head and presented it to Ibn Zeyad.
Then you rebelled against Banu Umayyah. They put you to death,
hung one of you on the branches of a date palm, burnt him in the fire,
in that way they killed Yahya bin Zaid in Khorasan. Your men were
killed and your children and women were imprisoned and made to sit
on camels without veils, sent them to Syria like slave girls on sale until
we stood up in revolt and we demanded compensation for' your
blood. Then we took revenge for the killings and we made you the
masters of their lands and property. We venerated your elders. Do
you want to declare us guilty on this account? Perhaps you have been
deceived because they used to mention your father having a priority
over Hamza 4,;,, Abbas ~ and Jafar ~ - The fact is that whatever you
have thought is not the reality. They all left the world in the highest
state of cleanliness and everyone recognized their virtue and greatness
without dispute. However, your father was involved in internal

308

The Hislory of Islam

fighting and killing. Banu Umayyah used to curse him as the
unbelievers are cursed in the obligatory prayers. So, we quarreled
with them, we narrated the virtues of those who were cursed, we
adopted strict measures against Banu Umayyah and punished them.
Our greatness during the days of ignorance yVas by virtue of our
supplying water to the . pilgrims, and this privilege was available to
Abbas 4,, only. Your father quarreled with us over it. Umar bin AlKhattab ~ gave his judgement in our favor. So, we have been the
owner of this honor both during the days of ignorance and the time of
Islam. During the famine in Madinah Umar bin Al-Khattab .J., prayed
to Allah for rain by means of our father and he sent down rain.
Though your father was alive, he did not ask for rain through him. Do
you know that when the Prophet ~ breathed his last, none except
Abbas ~ from among Banu Abdul Muttalib was left? Therefore, the
legacy was transferred to the paternal uncle. Then several persons
from Banu Hashim wanted to be caliph but none except the
descendants of Abbas .J., were successful. The authority of cup bearing
already belonged to him, the Prophet's legacy from Abdul Muttalib
and the caliphate came to his descendants. In short no distinction
between this world and hereafter between the days of ignorance and
Islam remained which Abbas .J., was not the inheritor.of. When Islam
spread, Abbas ~ had stood surety for Abu Talib and his descendants
and cared for them during the famine. Had Abbas 4i> not been spared
in the expedition of Badr, Abu Talib and Agee! would have starved to
death and would have continued to lick the utensils of Utbah and
Shaibah, but Abbas .J., kept providing them with food . He saved your
honor, protected you from slavery and continued to supply food and
clothing. Then in the battle of Badr, he had released Agee! by paying
the ransom. So, why do you brag before us? We cared for your family
during unbelief, paid your ransom, saved the honor of your elders,
became the heirs to the last Prophet ~ , took revenge for you and
achieved what you failed to achieve. Peace be upon you.
It is understood that in the matter of racial pride Mohammad Mahdi
undoubtedly started the rivalry and what Mansoor wrote, he wrote
replying to this rivalry. However, Mansoor went beyond the limit in
his reply. Mohammad Mahdi wrote nothing negative about Abbas ~-

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

309

But Mansoor unnecessarily used impertinent words about Ali bin Abi
Talib ~ - He has also slandered Ali~ when he said that the latter took
out Fatima Zahra during the day time for the sake of increasing his
chances of getting the caliphate. He also was very rude regarding the
Hasan ~- The fact is that Hasan bin Ali -$- did not sell out the
caliphate rather he unified and reconciled the two warring factions of
the Muslims and thereby he fulfilled the Prophet's prophecy. Abbas ~
helped Abu Talib without doubt and brought up Aqeel and kept him
with him. But to speak of it satirically and ironically does not befit a
person of noble bearing. Actually to mention such favors is considered
to be a sign of meanness and by mentioning such things, he has
displayed his lowness.
After making the administrative arrangements · for Madinah,
Mohammad Mahdi sent Mohammad bin Hasan bin Muawiya bin
Abdullah bin ]afar to Makkah, Qasim bin Ishaq to Yemen and Musa
bin Abdullah to Syria as Amirs. So Mohammad bin Hasan and Qasim
bin Ishaq left Madinah together. The Abbasid administrator of
Makkah fought and lost and Mohammad bin Hasan occupied it.
After dispatching the above mentioned letter, Mansoor sent Isa bin
Musa to fight with Mohammad Mahdi. Isa was accompanied by
Mohammad bin Saffah, Katheer bin Haseen Abdi and Humaid bin
Qahtaba and at the time of departure Isa bin Musa and other
commanders were instructed that if they got the better of Mohammad
Mahdi, they should not kill him but give him pardon and safety. If he
went into hiding then the civilians of Madinah who know him should
be arrested and those from among the descendants of Abi Talib who
visited them should have their names record and the commanders
should send them to him and those who refused to call on them, the
commanders should confiscate their money and property. When Isa
bin Musa reached Feed, he sent for a few people from Madinah by
letter. Abdullah bin Mohammad bin Omar bin Ali bin Abi Talib, his
brother Omar bin Mohammad bin Ali bin Abi Talib, Abu Aqeel
Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Aqeel came out of Madinah and went
to Isa. When Mohammad Mahdi was informed of his arrival, he
consulted with his men on whether they should fight outside of
Madinah or defend by remaining inside. When the counselors

310

The History of Islam

disagreed, following the Prophet ~ , he ordered the same trench to be
dug, which the Prophet ~ had originally used. Meanwhile Isa bin
Musa camped at Awad . Mohammad Mahdi forbade the people of
Madinah to fight outside the city and so no one was allowed to go out.
When Isa approached near to Madinah, he allowed the people to go
out of the city. It was a mistake that he cancelled his first order. The
people of Madinah in large numbers along with their families went to
the mountains for safety because of this, only a very small number
remained with Mohammad Mahdi in Madinah to fight Isa. It was at
that time that he realized his blunder and he sent his men to bring them
back but they could not. Isa left Awad and camped at a distance of four
miles from Madinah. He deployed a part of the army on the road to
Makkah so that Mohammad Mahdi would not be able to escape and go
to Makkah. Then he sent word to him, "Caliph Mansoor grants you
pardon and safety, invites you towards judgment by the Book and
Sunnah and threatens you with the consequences of rebellion."
Mohammad Mahdi sent back the reply that he was a man who never
turned his back for fear of being killed. On 12 Ramadan 145 A.H., Isa
bin Musa went ahead and camped at Jurf. On 14 Ramadan 145 A.H.
he stood at a high place and spoke loudly, "O the people of Madinah 1
I grant you safety provided you don't intervene between Mohammad
Mahdi and me and stay neutral."
The Madinah people heard and began to abuse him and Isa went
back. The next day he went to the same place again with the intention
of fighting and spread out his commanders around Madinah.
Mohammad Mahdi also came out to face him. His flag was held by
Uthman bin Mohammad bin Khalid bin Zubair and his saying was
Ahad, Ahad (One, One). Abu Ghulmash was the first to come out from
his side to challenge the enemies. Several renowned commanders
from Isa's side came onto the field to answer his challenge but they all
lost their lives. Then the battle began with both sides exhibiting real
bravery . The commanders of both sides displayed wonderful
swordsmanship and breached the opposing lines. Then at Isa's
instance Humaid bin Qahtaba moved towards the nearest wall of the
trench with his troops. Mohammad Mahdi's men tried to prevent
them by shooting arrows at them but Humaid continued his forward

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

311

march firmly and leveled it to the ground, crossed the trench and
began hand to hand combat with Mohammad Mahdi's soldiers. This
gave Isa the chance to fill up the moat at several places to make a way
across it. The cavalry crossed the moat and pounced upon
Mohammad Mahdi's army and a fierce battle ensued. Mohammad
Mahdi's army was small and the invaders out-numbered them several
times over and they were more fully armed. The battle continued from
morning to the time of the mid-afternoon prayer. Mohammad Mahdi
granted open permission to his men to save themselves if they liked.
His followers requested him repeatedly to save himself and to go to
Basra or Makkah and after collecting men and weapons anew to face
his opponents again. But he gave the same reply to all, saying, "If you
want to save yourselves, you are at liberty to go anywhere you like
but I cannot flee because of fear of the enemy." Finally, only 300 men
were left with him and at that time one of his men, Isa bin Khudair
burnt the register containing the names of those who took the oath
with him. Then he went to the jail and killed Rabah bin Uthman and
his brother. Mohammad bin Qasri shut the door of his room and
survived. After doing this, he came back to Mohammad Mahdi and
began to fight again. His cavalry cut off the legs of their horses, broke
into pieces their sheaths, took the pledge of death and attacked the
enemies. The attack was so fierce and horrible that Isa's army suffered
a defeat and retreated and fled. A few of Isa's men climbed around a
hill and went down its other side into Madinah, took a black covering
of an Abbasid woman and waved it over the minaret of the mosque
like a flag . Mohammad Mahdi's men were out of their wits when they
saw it. They thought that Isa's men had taken possession of Madinah
and they moved backward. Isa's fleeing soldiers took advantage of the
opportunity they rallied and attacked again. One of the groups
entered the city from Banu Ghaffar's side and began to fight with
Mohammad Mahdi. The situation was contrary to what he expected.
Mohammad Mahdi did not expect that Banu Ghaffar would allow a
way for the enemy to enter. Resolving himself to this he moved
forward and called out to Humaid bin Qahtaba to single combat but
Humaid did not dare to come out to face him. Mohammad Mahdi's
men again launched the attack on the enemies. Isa bin Khudair was
fighting very valiantly. Isa bin Musa went forward and called him

312

The History of Islam

loudly, "I grant you safety and pardon. Give up fighting." But Isa bin
Khudair did not care about this and continued until he fell down
exhausted and mortally wounded. Mohammad Mahdi began to fight
over his dead body. Isa bin Musa's soldiers attacked him from all
sides and he retaliated and pushed them back. He displayed such
matchless valor and his martial art was so superior, that none from
among Isa bin Musa's soldiers dared to fight with him. At last, some
one speared him from behind. As he bent down a little under its
impact, Humaid bin Qahtaba rushed forwar,<;i and pierced his chest
with his javelin. When two javelins passed through his chest from the
front and the back, he fell dead. Humaid bin Qahtaba quickly got
down from his horse and severed his head and brought it to Isa bin
Musa . . Immediately after the death of this valiant warrior, Madinah
fell to Isa bin Musa. He sent his head and the letter of victory to
Mansoor by the hands of Mohammad bin Abilkaram bin Abdullah bin
Ali bin Abdullah bin Jafar and Qasim bin Hasan bin Zaid bin Hasan
bin Ali bin Abi Talib. This disaster occurred on Monday 15 _Ramadan
145 A.H. between the afternoon prayer and the sunset prayer. Isa bin
Musa hanged Mohammad Mahdi's dead body on a cross between
Madinah and Thaniyatul wada' . His sister Zainab took permission
and buried his dead body in Baqi. In this battle Mohammad Mahdi's
brother Musa bin Abdullah Hamza bin Abdullah bin Mohammad bin
Ali bin Husain, Ali bin Zaid bin Ali bin Husain bin Ali, Zaid bin
Hasan bin Zaid bin Hasan fought on Mohammad Mahdi's side. It is
surprising that the fathers of Ali and Zaid were Mansoor's supporters.
Similarly, there were other Hashmite and Alawiite fathers and sons
who were pitted against one another. Perhaps they were horrified at
the sight of Banu Abbas' s killings and annihilation as was Ali bin
Husain (Zainul Abedeen) who was so shocked and terrified having
been witness to the scene at Karbala that he never did anything
against Banu Umayyah and always supported them. In the same way,
the influential among the Alawiites considered opposition of Banu
Abbas to be the cause of destruction. Mohammad Mahdi suffered
defeat simply because his own relatives did not support him and that
their lack of support alienated others. So when he took the oath from
the people of Madinah and announced his caliphate after imprisoning
Rabah bin Uthman, he sent for Ismail bin Abdullah bin Jafar, an old

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

313

man, to take the oath. He wrote back, "Nephew, you will be killed.
How can I take the oath for you?" Hearing his reply some people who
had taken the oath retracted it. Hamadah bint Muawiya came to
Ismail bin Abdullah and said to him, "Your statement has alienated
many people from Mohammad Mahdi but my brothers are still with
him. I am afraid they may also be killed with him." In brief, alienation
of his relatives and members of his family kept him from growing
powerful otherwise, the caliphate might have possibly come to the
descendants of Hasan 4;,. If he had escaped and stayed clear of
Madinah or had not revolted so soon and had waited for his brother
to follow suit and both of them had revolted together, success would
have been sure. Mansoor and the Abbasids were lucky that the
Abbasid army had to fight Mohammad and Ibrahim one after another
while their strength remained undivided.

The Rebellion of Ibrahim bin Abdullah
When Mansoor had come on a visit to inspect the building of
Baghdad, Ibrahim bin Abdullah, Mohammad Mahdi's brother, was
with him in disguise. He escaped to Kufa and Mansoor sent out spies
to hunt him down. When he thought that Ibrahim was in Basra, he
sent a spy to every house there, though Ibrahim was with Sufyan bin
Hibban Qammi at his house in Kufa. lt was a well-known fact that
Sufyan was a close friend of Ibrahim. Sufyan was horrified to see how
tight the surveillance was. He !Tlapped out a plan to allow Ibrahim to
leave safely. He went to Mansoor and said to him, "Give me in writing
a permit for free passage for me and my slaves and a small body of
soldiers so that I may arrest Ibrahim wherever we find him." Mansoor
did accordingly. Sufyan returned home he had Ibrahim put on his
slave's clothes, took him with them and left Kufa with his small force.
He came to Basra, deployed the soldiers to search eac_h house. When
the soldiers had left, he sent him to Ahwaz and he himself went into
hiding. Sufyan bin Muawiya was the Amir of Basra at that time. When
he found out, he collected the deployed soldiers and started searching
for Ibrahim bin Abdullah and Sufyan bin Hibban but without success.
Mohammad bin Haseen was the Amir of Ahwaz. When Ibrahim
reached Ahwaz, he stayed with Hasan bin Habeeb. His spies informed
the Amir of Ahwaz that Ibrahim was in Ahwaz. He began searching

314

The History of Islam

for him. Ibrahim remained hidden in Habeeb' s house for a long time
and continued to let people participate in the propagation for his
cause. In 145 A.H. Yahya bin Zeyad bin Hibban Nabti called Ibrahim
to Basra and enthusiastically began to invite the people to take the
oath for Mohammad Mahdi. A large group of learned and influential
people took the oath. 4000 people were enrolled in the Basra Register
as having taken the oath. During this period, Mohammad Mahdi
revolted in Madinah and wrote to Ibrahim to revolt in Basra. Mansoor
had sent a few commanders to Basra as a precautionary measure so
that they might help the Administrator of Basra, Sufyan bin Muawiya,
if there was any sign of mutiny. If Ibrahim had risen in revolt then as
Muhammad Mahdi had requested, Mansoor would have been quite
helpless and both the brothers would have gathered strength.
However, at that time, Ibrahim was sick in Basra and so he
temporarily delayed his revolt. When Mansoor sent the army to fight
with Mohammad Mahdi, Ibrahim rebelled in Basra on 1 Ramadan 145
A.H. Jafar and Muhammad, the sons ofSulaiman bin Ali, Mansoor's
cousins had been lying in wait along with 600 men outside of Basra by
the orders of Mansoor. As soon as the brothers heard the news of
Ibrahim's rebellion, they attacked and only 50 men were sent out to
face those 600 men yet they defeated them and forced them to flee.
Ibrahim captured all of Basra and took the oath from the people in
general and proclaimed a general amnesty and pardon. He then
withdrew two hundred thousand dirhams from the treasury and
distributed it at the rate of 50 dirhams to each of his men. Then he sent
Mughira to Ahwaz along with 100 soldiers. The administrator of
Ahwaz, Mohammad bin Haseen, came out with 4000 soldiers to fight
the small force but they defeated the 4000 soldiers and Mughira
captured Ahwaz. Ibrahim sent Amr bin Shaddad to Persia where the
Governor Ismail bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib
and his brother Abdus Samad clashed with him but they suffer a
defeat and Amr bin Shaddad occupied Persia. Similarly, Haroon bin
Shams Ajli was ordered to march towards Wasit and he defeated
Mansoor's Governor Haroon bin Humaid Ayadi and captured Wasit.
In short, the day Mohammad Mahdi and Isa bin Musa clashed with
each other leading to Muhammad Mahdi's martyrdom, Basra, Persia
Wasit and a big part of Iraq had gone out of Mansoor's control. Syria

I
. The Caliphate of the Abbas ids (First Phase)

315

was soon to go out of his hands and the Kufans had also been waiting
and watching. Mansoor's government stood no chance of survival.
Ibrahim revolted in Basra on 1 Ramadan and continued the series of
victories until the end of the month. Immediately after the end of
Ramadan Ibrahim received the news of Mohammad Mahdi's death.
He offered the prayer for the Eid at the end of Ramadan and in the
sermon announced the news. When the news was heard by those who
were engaged in fighting with Mansoor's administrator, their spirits
were dampened . It encouraged Mansoor's commanders and
administrators. When the people of Basra received the news, they
recognized Ibrahim as their caliph in place of Mohammad Mahdi and
were ready to show their readiness more than they did before. There
were many Kufans among Ibrahim's men in Basra. The people from
Basra wanted Basra to be the capital and command center for
deploying troops in the surrounding areas. But the Kufans disagreed
with them and suggested that Ibrahim should take his army towards
Kufa where the inhabitants were waiting for him. Ibrahim agreed with
them and made up his mind to go to Kufa after making his son his
deputy there. When the news reached Mansoor, he was very
disturbed. Immediately he sent a messenger to Isa bin Musa asking
him to come at once to him at Kufa. He wrote to Mahdi in Khorasan
and asked him to invade Persia immediately. So all the administrators
who were safe from danger were called. He asked those who were
near to Mansoor' s commanders not to lose heart. Troops from all sides
began to pour in fast until a one hundred thousand man army
collected in Kufa. When he had received the news of Ibrahim's attack,
Mansoor did not change his clothes for 50 days. He often kept sitting
on his prayer mat. Ibrahim bin Abdullah with a one hundred
thousand man army camped at a distance of 30 or 40 miles from Kufa,
and Isa bin Musa arrived in Kufa with his own army. Mansoor sent
Isa bin Musa to confront Ibrahim and deployed Humaid bin Qahtaba
at the vanguard. Ibrahim was advised to dig a moat around the
military camp but his men said that they were not the attacked but the
attackers so no moat was needed. His men advised Ibrahim to send
soldiers to fight in divisions so that in case of the defeat of one
division of the army another fresh divisism might be sent in as
reinforcements. However, Ibrahim disapproved of the suggestion and

316

The History of Islam

ordered the soldiers to stand and fight by arraying themselves
according to .the traditional way. Humaid bin Qahtaba fled after being
defeated. Isa tried to stop him by rebuking him but he did not stop.
Isa then threw himself into the battle. However, most of his men could
not stand the pressure and started fleeing. Isa still stood firm on the
battlefield but when there was no doubt of his immanent defeat, Jafar
and Muhammad, Sulaiman bin Ali's sons, arrived behind Ibrahim
with their army. Ibrahim's soldiers grew nervous at the fresh invasion
and diverted their attention towards them. Isa regrouped his men and
attacked and the runaway soldiers rallied. Humaid bin Qahtaba also
regroupE;d and attacked with his men. Ibrahim's army was between
the invading armies, which cut the battlefield in size and his soldiers
were not able to fight wholeheartedly. At last, they became disarrayed
and began to flee. Finally, only 400 men were left with him. They were
surrounded by Isa, Humaid, Mohammad and Jafar. An arrow pierced
Ibrahim's neck, which proved fatal. His men dismounted him from
their horses, made a circle around him and continued defending and
fighting. Qahtaba ordered his cavalry to launch an attack with all their
power. He defeated Ibrahim's men, cut off his head and presented it
to Isa who sent it to Mansoor. This took place on 25 Dhul Qada 145
A.H. With this victory, he was able to arrest Hasan bin Ibrahim bin
Abdullah in Basra and imprison him. He imprisoned Yaqub bin
Dawood also.

Miscellaneous Events
After getting free from the killing of Mohammad Mahdi and his
brother, Mansoor assigned the governorship of Basra to Salim bin
Qutaiba Bah.Ii and that of Mousil to his own son Jafar. He sent Harith
bin Abdullah as Commander of the armed forces with him.
Imam Malik .'ii, ._,..; who had induced people to take the oath for
Mohammad Mahdi, was lashed. Imam Abu Hanifa .'iii u-; who gave a
fatwah (religious judgment) in favor of Ibrahim bin Abdullah was
arrested and brought before Mansoo_r who imprisoned him in
Baghdad where construction work on the city was still in progress. It
is said that Mansoor wanted to appoint him to the post of chief justice.
When he refused, he was assigned to count and keep the i:ecords of

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

317

the bricks used in the construction. In that state of captivity he died in
150 A.H. Besides these famous scholars other scholars like lbn Ajlan,
Abdul Humaid bin Jafar and others who gave religious judgments to
take the oath for Mohammad Mahdi and his brother Ibrahim were
persecuted like wise.
In 146 A.H., the Turks in Khazar revolted and marched from Babul
Abwab to Armenia killing and slaughtering Muslims. That same year
the Muslims launched a naval attack on Cyprus. When the Khwarij
rebelled in Sis tan, Mansoor transferred Ma' an bin Zaidah from the
governorship of Yemen to Sistan where he ended the disorder and
fighting. He remained there until 151 A.H. until he was eventually
murdered treacherously by the Khwarij.

Abdullah Ushtar lbn Mohammad Mahdi
When Mohammad Mahdi revolted, the governor of Sindh was
Mansoor's man Omar bin Hafs bin Uthman bin Qabisah bin Abi
Sufrah. After the revolt, Mohammad Mahdi had sent his son Abdullah
alias Ushtar to his uncle Ibrahim in Basra. From there Ushtar at the
instance of his uncle, took a swift-paced she-camel and set out for
Sindh because sympathy and possible reinforcements were expected
from the governor. Abdullah Ushtar reached Sindh, invited Omar bin
Hafs to their cause and he accepted, recognized Mohammad Mahdi's
caliphate, defaced the symbols of the Abbasids and incorporated
Mohammad Mahdi's name into the Friday sermon. During the same
period, news of Mohammad Mahdi's death reached the governor. He
informed Abdullah Ushtar of the incident and offered his
condolences. Ushtar said, "Now my life is in danger. Where should I
go and what should I do?" There were many kings in Sindh who had
converted to Islam during Omar bin Abdul Aziz's regime and who
ruled according to his directives in their jurisdictions. They recognized
the reigning caliphs but followed all the supporters of Islam and stuck
to the rights of their rule. Omar bin Hafs told Ushtar to go to a certain
state of a Sindhi King. He loves the Prophet ~ and is known for the
fulfillment of his commitments. He will surely treat you kindly,
affectionately and respectfully. Abdullah Ushtar expressed his
willingness. Omar received a written pledge from that king for Ushtar

1

,1

318

The History of Islam

through correspondence and sent Ushtar to him. The Sindhi king
married his daughter to him. He lived there until 151 A.H. and during
that period about 400 Arabs drawn from the adjoining areas collected
at Ushtar's place. By chance, Mansoor came to know that Abdullah
Ushtar was living with the King of Sindh and a small group of Arabs
were with him. Mansoor recalled Omar bin Hafs from the
governorship of Sindh and sent him to Egypt in the same capacity. He
dispatched Hisham bin 'Amr Taghlibi to Sindh as governor. At the
time of departure, he ordered him to arrest Ushtar at any cost. If the
Sindhi King refused to hand him over, he should attack him. Hisham
bin Amr tried his best to recover Abdullah Ushtar but the Sindhi King
would not give him up. At last, they prepared to fight. The part of the
country where Ushtar was staying was attacked by Safih, Hisham bin
' Amr's ·brother. One day it so happened that Ushtar in the company of
10 horsemen went along the Sindh River for sightseeing. Suddenly
they came across Safih's army. Safih tried to arrest him. Ushtar and
his men fought. At last, Ushtar and his men were killed . Hisham bin
'Amr informed Mansoor of the incident. He wrote back to him that the
country of that king must be destroyed. So a chain of battles began.
His~am eventually captured his whole country. Ushtar's wife along
with her son were caught and sent to Mansoor. He sent them to
Madinah to be under the guardianship of the deceased's family .

Mahdi bin Mansoor's Succession
At the time of his death, Abdullah Saffah had made Mansoor his heirapparent to be followed by Isa bin Musa after him. Now according to
the will Isa bin Musa was to be the caliph after Mansoor. However,
when Mansoor was relieved from the dangers of Mohammad Mahdi
and Ibrahim and no longer needed Isa bin Musa's help, he wished to
make his own son Mahdi his successor. First, he mentioned it to Isa
but Isa refused to accept it. Mansoor then manipulated to allow
Khalid bin Barmak and some other non-Arab chiefs participate in the
consultations and support fus stand and then he deposed Isa bin Musa
from the governorship of Kufa, in which capacity he had been serving
since Saffah' s time and sent Mohammad bin Sulaiman as governor in
his place. The dismissal from the governorship led to the liquidation
of his power and he realized his mistake of disagreeing with Mansoor.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

319

In short, by rendering Isa powerless Mansoor, by virtue of his
cunningness, deceit, allurement and hypocrisy took from the people
the oath for the succession of Mahdi. He tried to console Isa bin Musa
too by making him the successor after Mahdi. Khalid bin Barmak gave
publicity to the statement that Isa abdicated in his presence and so the
Amir Al-Muminin made his son his successor. For this act, Mansoor
had spent money lavishly and pleased the people by giving away gifts
and rewards to them on the occasion. Isa bin Musa had contributed
most to strengthening and saving Mansoor' s government. It was Isa
who defeated and killed Mohammad Mahdi and Ibrahim and relieved
him of a great danger. In exchange for these services he rendered he
was rewarded with dismissal from the succession and Mahdi bin
Mansoor superseded him. After the deposition from the governorship
of Kufa, he went to Rahba in Kufa, settled down there and began to
pass a quiet life.
Slowly and gradually all the obstacles in Mansoor's way were cleared
except Spain, his government was firmly established in all the Islamic
countries by 148 A.H. In 149 A.H., the construction of Baghdad was
also completed. Because of the above situations and incidents, the
Muslims did not have time to declare Jihad on the Romans. In 149
A.H., Abbas bin Mohammad, Hasan bin Qahtaba and Mohammad bin
Ash'ath invaded the Romans and scored many victories against them.

Ustad Sees's revolt
In 150 A.H. Ustad Sees claimed to be a prophet in Khorasan.
Thousands of people accepted his prophethood at once. The
inhabitants of Herat, Badghais, and Sistan assembled under his flag
and the greater part of Khorasan fell to him. Mansoor was extremely
concerned and pensive on hearing this. The ruler of Mardrood named
Jasm, observed the sjtuation and attacked him with all his might. Jasm
was defeated and killed. Then Khazim bin Khuzaima used strategy
and surrounded Ustad Sees's army and attacked him on two flanks.
70,000 men of Ustad Sees were killed. He was besieged along with
14,000 remaining men in a mountain. After a prolonged siege, he
surrendered along with his men to Khuzaima and Mansoor was
informed of Ustad Sees' s capture.

320

The History of Islam

The Building of Rosafah
When Ustad Sees revolted, Khorasan was governed by Mahdi. He
lived at Merv. Khazim bin Khuzaima also lodged with him and
attacked at the instance of Mansoor. Becoming free from this trouble,
Mahdi went to Mansoor. At that time, the dominating elements of
power were the Arab tribes and they alone were responsible for all the
territorial victories. The non-Arabs and Khorasanis did not claim to be
equal to the Arabs in military expertise. The Arab tribes were always
feared because if they united in opposition, they could topple the
government at any time. Imam Ibrahim was the first to realize this fact
and adopted the policy of strengthening the non-Arabs and utilizing
them to his advantage. His successors also followed suit. Following
this strategy, Abdullah Saffah had Abu Sulamih killed, and appointed
Khalid bin Barmak as his minister, who was originally a Zoroastrian
from Nawbahar, a new Muslim and a military chief of Abu Muslim.
After a short time, he was made the governor of a state. Abu Ayyub
replaced him and Mansoor made him the minister again. The
Zoroastrians were assigned as military chiefs and governors of
various states and their power continued to rise but the military
element of the Arabs was still dominant. This policy reminds us of the
Indian King Akbar and his dual policy, which he had adopted to
safeguard himself against the powerful and influential Pathans, in
India. He thought it essential to breathe a new life into the dead
Hindu community and make them powerful in order to avert and
· lessen the danger from the Pathans so much so that he made Man
Singh the commander-in-chief of India and continued his efforts to
weaken the Pathans everywhere. The Abbasids also reduced the Arab
power and replaced t~~m by the fire-worshippers and the Iranians so
that no Alawiite would dare to rise in revolt with the support of the
Arab tribes. On the occasion of Mahdi's return from Khorasan and
appearance before Mansoor, the Arab soldiers, in order to receive
compensation, behaved in such a way that exhibited their
independence of mind and strong will. They were not in the habit of
showing respect to their king or caliph unnecessarily like the
fireworshipping Zoroastrians. This kept the Abbasids in perpetual
fear. Perhaps it was this independence of mind that never deterred

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

321

them from joining every new movement and every new claimant to
the caliphate. Qasam bin Abbas bin Obaidullah bin Abbas, after
watching and studying the condition of the army, cleverly created a
rivalry and animosity between two Arab tribes, Rabia and Mudar.
Then he advised Mansoor, saying, "As there is enmity between the
tribes of Mudar and Rabia, it is reasonable that you divide the army
into two parts. Keep the Mudar tribe under Mahdi because the
Khorasanis are their supporters and keep the Rabia tribe under you
because all the Yemenis are their sympathizers. With two army
headquarters set up on different sides they will be kept afraid of each
other, ruling out any possibility of mutiny."
Mansoor liked the idea and for the living quarters of his son Mahdi he
ordered Rosafah to be constructed to the north of Baghdad in 151 A.H.
and to set up a separate cantonment for his forces there. That same
year 153 A.H. Mohammad Ash'ath died on his return journey from
the Roman territories.
In 153 A.H., Mansoor made a pr?clamation to the effect that all his
subjects should put on high caps that were made of bamboo and
leaves. These caps were generally used by Africans. In 154 A.H. Zafar
bin Asim invaded Rome. In 155 A.H. the Roman emperor, becoming
exhausted from repeated invasions by the Muslims, requested for
reconciliation and agreed to pay the Jizyah.

The Death of Mansoor
In 158 A.H., Mansoor wrote to the administrator of Makkah to arrest
Sufyan Thouri and Abbad bin Katheer and send them to him. The
people apprehended that' he might murder them. The season of Hajj
was approaching and Mansoor had made up his mind to go to Hajj.
This caused concern among the Makkans even more. Only Allah knew
how many people would be arrested and killed. But the Makkan's
prayer was granted and Mansoor died before reaching Makkah. The
details of the incident are as follows . In the month of Dhul Qada 158
A.H., M,ansoor ·left for Baghdad with the intention of Hajj. At the time
of departure he made his son Mahdi his deputy there and made the
following will:

322

The History of Islam

"Protect the box containing my dairies and look for solutions to
your problems therein. Safeguard the city of Baghdad and don't
change or shift the capital. I have accumulated treasure that will
suffice to pay the salaries of the soldiers and meet other
administrative expenditures even if no tax is collected for 10
years. Deal with your relatives kindly, honor them and appoint
them to high posts. I exhort you to treat the Khorasanis well for
they are your helpers and your right hand and have sacrificed
their lives and material for establishing the government and
rule of your family. I think you will not be able to forget their
love. Excuse their mistakes and please them with gifts and
rewards for their remarkable achievements. Beware! Don't seek
hrlp from anybody belonging to Banu Sulaim. Don't allow your
women to poke their .,,_noses into your affairs. Protect the
community of the Prophet ~- Don't shed unnecessary and
unlawful blood. Abide by the limits prescribed by Allah. Attack
the atheists and stamp out alterations in the religion or any
schism. Do justice and don't be immoderate. Leave the spoils
for the soldiers for I have left you a huge treasure. Protect your
borders and see that the roads are safe and peaceful. Take care
of the peoples' property. Don't part with the group. Always be
ready with cavalry and foot soldiers in as large numbers as
possible. Don't postpone your work for the morrow. Be firm in
times of adversity and misfortune. Don't be lazy. Make it easy
for the people to visit your court. Beware of the doorkeepers
and see that they are not strict with the people."
Mansoor left Baghdad and arrived in Kufa. He entered in the state of
Ihram (the rituals) for Hajj and Umrah and sent ahead the sacrificial
animals. He had hardly traveled two or three stages from Kufa when
,he was taken ill. During that illness, he kept his liberated slave Rabi,
who was his doorkeeper and officer of his bodyguards, in attendance.
He died on 6 Dhul Hijjah 158 A.H. at Batan, a place three miles from
Makkah. No one except his chief attendants and Rabi were present at
the time of his death. They concealed the news of his death that day.
The next day Isa bin Ali, Isa bin Musa bin Mohammad, Abbas bin
Mohammad bin Sulaiman, Ibrahim bin Yahya, Qasim bin Mansoor,
Hasan bin Zaid Alawi, Musa bin Mahdi bin Mansoor, and Ali bin Isa

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

323

bin Mahan who accompanied him on the journey, were called to
appear in the court. Rabi announced the news of the caliph's death.
He then read out a paper written by Mansoor, which said:
In the name of Allah, the Most Beneficent and Merciful. From
Abdullah Mansoor to those who remain of Banu Hashim,
Khorasanis and the general Muslims. I am writing this will
during my lifetime, the last day of this world and the first day
of my hereafter. I offer you the greeting of peace and Pray Allah
not to put you into any mischief nor to divide you into sects nor
give you a chance to taste civil war. You have admitted to obey
my son Mahdi, abide by it and refrain from breach of trust and
betrayal.
Having read the paper Rabi beckoned Musa bin Mahdi bin Mansoor
to take the oath on behalf of his father Mahdi as his deputy. He first
caught hold of Hasan bin Zaid' s hands and_asked him to get up and
take the oath. Hasan complied, and the others followed suit one after
another. Isa bin Musa refused. Ali bin Isa bin Mahan said, "If you
refuse to take the oath, I shall chop off your head ." Thus forced Isa bin
Musa also took the oath then the chiefs of the army and the general
public followed. Then Abbas bin Mohammad and Mohammad bin
Sulaiman visited Makkah and standing near to the Ka'bah, they took
the oaths of the people for Mahdi. Then Isa bin Musa led the funeral
prayer. He was buried in the 'Mu'alla' graveyard in between Hajoon
and Maimoon well. Then Rabi sent the news of Mansoor' s death, his
ring and the Prophet's ,i coverlet and staff to Mahdi. The news
reache1 Mahdi in Baghdad on 15 Dhul Hijjah 158 A.H. The
inhabitants of the city came to Mahdi and took the oath.
Mansoor was Caliph for 22 years less one week. He left seven sons and
one daughter. The names of his sons were: Mohammad Mahdi, Jafar
Akbar, Jafar Asghar, Sulaiman, Isa, Yaqub, and Salim. The name of his
daughter was Aliyah who was married to Ishaq bin Sulaiman bin Ali.
Somebody asked Caliph Mansoor, "Have you any wish that has
rema.ined unfulfilled?" He said, "Only one wish is left to be fulfilled.
And that is: I am sitting on a platform and the seekers of the Ah&dith
are sitting around me." The next day when the ministers came to him

324

The History of Islam

with papers, registers of litigation and writing utensils, the man who
had put the question to Mansoor was also present at the time. He said,
"Lo! Your wish has also been fulfilled." Mansoor said, "These are not
the people I wish for those, that I long for have torn clothes, bare feet
and long hair and they narrate Ahtidith."
When Mansoor persuaded Imam Malik to compile the Muwatta, he
said to him, "O Abu Abdullah! You know that none except you and I
are left in Islam who know the Shariah best. I am engaged in the
wrangling of the caliphate and its authority. You are free. Write a
book for the benefit of the people. Don't fill the book with the
justifications of Ibn Abbas and the violence and prudence of Ibn Omar
and set an example of composition and compilation for the people."
Imam Malik says, "By Allah! Mansoor did not say these things but
taught me how to write."
Abdus Samad Mohammad said to Mansoor, "You have girded your
loins to punish people so much that none has the inkling that you
know how to forgive." He replied, "The blood of the descendants of
Marwan has not dried up and the swords of the descendants of Abi
Talib are still bare. This is the time when their hearts are not overawed
by the caliphs and this awe cannot be established unless they forget
the meaning of forgiveness and always expect to be punished." Zeyad
bin Abdullah Harithi wrote to Mansoor to increase his salary and
property rights a little. He used all his art of eloquence in its
presentation. Mansoor replied, "When prosperity and eloquence come
to a man, they make him self-conceited. I apprehend this danger in
you. It is · better if you ,give up eloquence." The African, Abdur
Rahman bin Zeyad had been Mansoor's friend since his student days.
Once during his caliphate he paid a visit to him. Mansoor said to him,
"How do you find my caliphate compared to that of Banu Umayyah?"
Abdur Rahman bin Zeyad said, "The atrocities that are p_e rpetrated in
your regime, were non-existent in that of Banu Umayyah." Mansoor
said, "What should I do? I don't find helpers." Abdur Rahman said,
"Omar bin Abdul Aziz 11 -.....J-J said, "If the king is pious, he will get
pious people. If he is wicked, the wicked will come to him." Once
Mansoor was fed up with some houseflies. He sent for Muqatil bin
Sulaiman and said, "Why has Allah created these flies?" Muqatil said,
"To humiliate the oppressors through them."

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

325

During Mansoor's regime translations of Suryani and Non-Arabic
books began to be made into Arabic. Geometry and 'Kalilah Dimnah'
were translated during his times. He made the palmists and
astronomers live near him. It was during his caliphate that the
Abbasids and Alawiites fought otherwise prior to it they were united.
In respect of his nature and habits and his deeds and remarkable
achievements Mansoor Abbasi resembled Abdul Malik Umayyah.
Abdul Malik was the second caliph of the Marwan dynasty and
Mansoor was also the second caliph of the Abbasid dynasty. Abdul
Malik saved the Umayyah caliphate from ruin. Similarly, Mansoor
saved the Abbasid caliphate from Mohammad Mahdi and his brother
Ibrahim. Abdul Malik was an Alim (scholar), a Faqih (an expert on
Islamic law) and a Mohaddith (he related the traditions of the Prophet
~)- Similarly Mansoor was an Alim and Faqih, Abdul Malik was
accused of being extremely economical and a miser. Mansoor was also
notorious for these same two characteristics. Both of them ruled for
almost the same duration. The only difference between them was the
fact that while Mansoor killed people even after granting them aman
(peace and safety), Abdul Malik remained spotless on this point.

Mahdi bin Mansoor
Mohammad Al-Mahdi bin Mansoor's familiar name (kunya) was Abu
Abdullah. He was born in Edaj in 126 A.H. His mother's name was
Umm Musa Arwa bint Mansoor Himyari. Mahdi was very generous,
widely admired, true in faith, popular and a handsome man. His
father put him under the charge and tutelage of a number of scholars.
When Mahdi was 15 years old, Mansoor sent him to put down the
mutiny caused by Abdul Jabbar bin Abdur-Rahman. In 141 A.H., he
was sent to Khorasan. When he returned from there in 144 A.H.,
Mansoor had him married to his niece, Saffah's daughter. He made
him the heir-apparent in 144 A.H. and sent him to Rayy as the
administrator of the Southern and Western parts of Khorasan. He
appointed him Amir al-Hajj (leader of the pilgrimage) in 153 A.H.
and following his father's death in 158 A.H., he ascended the throne of
the caliphate in Baghdad. When the people took bay'at (pledge or oath
of allegiance) with him in Baghdad, he climbed up the pulpit (the

326

The History of Islam

pulpit in mosques is generally raised so the whole congregation can
see the Imam) and delivered the following sermon:
"The man whom you call Amir al-M~r1inin (Leader of the true
believers) is nothing but a slave. When somebody calls him, he
responds and complies. It is Allah Who is the Protector of the
Amir al-Muminin. It is from Allah only that I seek help in ordet
to run the work of the caliphate. Just as you express your sense
of obedience with your tongue, co-operate with me with your
soul also so that you might become the beneficiaries of welfare
in this world and in the world hereafter. Don't oppose those
who propagate justice. I shall remove obstructions from your
way and dedicate my whole life serving you and punishing
those among you who are criminals and wrongdoers."
The first thing that Mahdi did after taking over as caliph was to
release all the captives in Mansoor' s jail. Only those who were rebels,
usurpers and murderers were not freed . Among the captives set free
was Yaqub bin Dawood. Those who were not released included
Hasan bin Ibrahim bin Abdullah bin Hasan bin Hasan. As mentioned
earlier, both Hasan and Yaqub were arrested in Basra together
following Ibrahim's death and imprisoned. Yaqub's father Dawood
was from among the liberated slaves of Banu Sulaim. He was Nasr bin
Sayyar's head-clerk in Khorasan. Dawood had two sons, Yaqub and
Ali. Both were scholars and extremely clever and wise. When Banu
Abbas came into power, Banu Sulaim was subjected to humiliation.
Yaqub and Ali who were from Banu Sulaim were neglected though
they merited serious attention by virtue of their qualifications. When
Mohammad Mahdi and Ibrahim began to invite the people to support
them against Banu_ ~bbas, Yaqub joined them and invited people to
support Mohammad Mahdi and Ibrahim, until he was imprisoned
along with Hasan bin Ibrahim. After his release from the jail, Yaqub
was found out that Hasan bin Ibrahim was trying to escape from jail.
He informed caliph Mahdi. Mahdi transferred Hasan to another jail
but he escaped anyway. Mahdi called Yagub to him and consulted
,with him aboi:it Hasan. Yagub said, "If you grant safety and pardon to
him, I can present him before you." Mahdi granted it and Yagub
brought Hasan before him. He had the assurance from Mahdi that

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

327

Hasan would be able to visit the caliph in court and out of court. The
occasion arose and Mahdi made Hasan his friend and gave him
100,000 dirhams. After a few days, Mahdi deposed Abu Abdullah, his
minister since the time he was declared heir-apparent, and replaced
him with Yaqub. Mahdi displayed a sense of justice and recognition of
merit by honoring Yaqub and Hasan and established their love for
him in their hearts even though they were his former enemies. The
greatest danger to the caliphate of the Abbasids was from the members
of Mohammad Mahdi and Ibrahim's group who had joined hands with
Yahya bin Zaid and they all were intent on bringing about the fall of
Banu Abbas. By making Yaqub his minister, Mahdi avoided all of these
dangers, for Yaqub had links with both of these groups. He appointed
them to high posts in the government and thus kept them from
opposing the caliphate and dampened their enthusiasm for opposition.

The Rise of Hakeem Muqanna
In 159 A.H., the first year of Mahdi's caliphate an inhabitant of Merv
named Hakeem Muqanna made a mask of gold and put it on his face.
He claimed that he was Allah. He believed that Allah created Adam
and entered his body, then entered Noah's body, then entered Abu
Muslim's body and Hashim's body. He believed in transmigration
and said, "Allah's soul is within me, He has entered my body." His
belief was the same as held by the people of Ravind who had created
perversions in the religion at Hashmiyah in the time of Mansoor. They
were all members of Abu Muslim's group and were the aberrations of
his strange and deviant form of propagation. Whoever Abu Muslim
met, he presented his peculiar form of propagation to him adapting it
to the demands of the situation and the person concerned. Abu
Muslim's ultimate motives were political and not religious and he
bent everything to suit those ends, even Allah's religion. All these
deviated sects were the consequences of using the Prophet's family for
political ends in different forms . Hakeem Muqanna also believed that
Yahya bin Zaid (who was from the Prophet's family) was not killed
but went into hiding and was expected to reappear to take revenge
and exterminate his enemies. Many Khorasanis became his followers
and began to make prostration to him (in Islam the act of prostration
is -due only to Allah and not to any creation). He stayed in the fort of

328

The History of Islam

Basam and Sanjar (in modern day Uzbekistan) . The people of
Bukhara, Safhad and Turkistan supported him and started
slaughtering the Muslims. The administrators of those regions like
Abu An Noman, Junaid and Lai th bin Nasr bin Sayyar fought against
them. Laith's brother Mohammad bin Nasr and nephew Hasan bin
Tamim were killed in the fight. When Mahdi came to know of it, he
sent Jibrail bin Yahya to help them. He deputed Jibrail's brother Yazid
to punish the insurgents of Bukhara and Safhad . First Bukhara and
Safhad were invaded. After 4 months of fighting the forts of Bukhara
were captured by the Muslims. 700 rebels were killed and the rest fled
to Muqanna. After a short time, Mahdi dispatched Abu Aun to attack
Muganna but those commanders could not defeat Muganna. Then
Mu'az bin Muslim was sent to defeat him. The officer of Mu'az bin
Muslim' s vanguard was Sayeed Huraithi. Then Ogba bin Muslim was
also ordered to join him. These commanders led a very bitter attack on
Muganna and put him to flight and encircled him in the fort of Basam.
During the fight, there appeared some differences between Mu'az and
Sayeed. Sayeed wrote to Mahdi and secured his permission to do
away with Muganna all alone. Muganna was besieged along with
20,000 of his men. The besieged asked Sayeed Huraithi for a guarantee
of safety. Sayeed granted it and they came out of the fort leaving only
2,000 men with Muqanna. When Muganna was certain of his failure,
he made a fire and pushed all the members of his family into it and
then he himself jumped into it and died. The Muslims entered the fort,
took Muqanna's dead body out of the fire, cut off his head and sent it
to Mahdi.

Change, Deposition and Appointment of
Administrators
··
In 155 A.H. Mahdi deposed his uncle Ismail from the government of
Kufa and appointed Ishaq bin Sabah Kindi Ash-athi. He removed
Sayeed, Da'laj and Obaidullah bin Hasan from the government and
leadership of Basra and appointed Abdul Malik bin Dhubyan
Numairi . Similarly the same year he deposed Qasam bin Abbas from
the government of Yamama and appointed Fadal bin Saleh, deposed
Matar (Mansoor's liberated slave) from the government of Egypt and
appointed Abu Hamza Mohammad bin Sulaiman, removed Abdus

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

329

Samad bin Ali from the government of Madinah and appointed
Mohammad bin Abdullah Kasiri. Soon after Mohammad bin Abdullah
was also removed and replaced by Zafar bin Asim Hilali . The same year
Mahdi sent Mabad bin Khalil as the governor of Sindh. When Humaid
bin Qahtaba who was the governor of Qahistan died the same year, that
is 159 A.H. its government was handed over to Abu Aun Abdul Malik
bin Yazid. At the end of the same year Sayeed bin Khalil died and the
government of Sindh was taken over by Ruh bin Hatim.
In 160 A.H., Abu Aun Abdul Malik was deposed as a punishment. His
place was taken by Mu'az bin Muslim. Sistan was assigned to Hamza
bin Yahya and Samarkand to Jibrail bin Yahya. During his regime,
Jibrail built the fort and erected fencing in Khorasan. The same year
Sindh was taken over by Bustam bin Amr. In 161 A.H., Mahdi gave
the governorship of Sindh to Nasr bin Mohammad bin Ash-ath. The
same year Abdus Samad bin Ali was sent to Jazirah. Isa bin Luqman
to Egypt and Bustam bin Amr to Azerbaijan after being deposed from
the governorship of Sindh. The same year he appointed Yahya bin
Khalid Barrnk as the tutor of his son, Haroon and he sent Sulaiman bin
Raja to Egypt as governor in place of Mohammad bin Sulaiman.

The expedition of Barbad
It was during the regime of caliph Mahdi that a naval expedition was
sent to India. Abdul Malik bin Shahab Masmai with an army boarded
the ships in the Persian Gulf and moved along the Indian coast. They
landed in Barbad and waged a battle and many Barbad men were
killed. Only 20 Muslims lost their lives but an epidemic broke out
among the Muslim soldiers leading to the death of 1000 of them. They
then turned their boats towards Persia. They met with a violent storm
near the Persian coast that shattered several boats and many soldiers
were downed.

Hadi bin Mahdi as Crown Prince
As has previously been mentioned, Isa bin Musa lived at Rahbah
adjacent to Kufa, visited Kufa to perform his Friday and Eid prayers
and spent all his time at his village quietly and without involving

330

The History of Islam

himself with the affairs of others. It has also been recorded that
Abdullah Saffah had made Isa heir apparent after Mansoor and
Mansoor made his son Mahdi supersede Isa. Isa bin Musa was the
rightful heir apparent after Mahdi but in the first year of his caliphate
Mahdi's advisers and supporters advised him to nominate his son
Hadi as his heir-apparent in place of Musa . Mahdi requested Isa to
visit Baghdad but Isa refused. Mahdi issued standing orders to the
governor of Kufa to harass him but as Isa had already been leading a
secluded life, the governor did not get an opportunity to carry out his
orders. Then Mahdi wrote a strict letter to Isa but he did not reply.
Then Mahdi sent his uncle Abbas to him to bring him into his
presence. Even then, Isa refused . At last, Mahdi deputed two
commanders to go and bring him. Compelled in this way, Isa came to
Baghdad and lodged with Mohammad bin Sulaiman. He visited
Mahdi's court from time to time but he went there silently, kept silent
while there and returned silently from there. At last, they started
torturing him and Mohammad bin Sulaiman himself wanted to
compel him to abdicate. Isa made excuses about the pledge, which he
had taken at the time of succession. Mahdi called the legal scholars.
They gave a religious verdict that Isa might retire from the succession
after paying compensation for breaking his oath. Mahdi gave him
10,000 dirhams and estates at Zab and Kaskar in lieu thereof. Isa
retired from the succession on 26 Muharram 160 A.H . and took the
oath for Hadi as the heir apparent. The next day Mahdi held an open
court, took the oath from the officials of the government, went to the
Central Mosque and delivered a sermon informing the people of Isa's
abdication and Hadi's succession. Isa admitted his retirement from the
succession and the people took oath for Hadi as the heir apparent.

Mahdi's Hajj
In Dhul Qada 160 A.H., Mahdi made preparations for Hajj and left his
son Hadi as his deputy in Baghdad. He had Hadi's maternal uncle
Yazid bin Mansoor live with Hadi and arranged for his second son,
Haroon and a few relatives, to live in Hadi's company. He himself left
for Makkah along with his minister Yaqub bin Dawood. After arriving
in Makkah, he had all the old covers of the Ka'bah removed and
covered it with a new and expensive cover (Arabic: Kiswah). He

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

331

distributed clothes to 150,000 paupers and extended the Prophet's
Mosque. On his return journey, he brought 500 families from the
Ansars to Iraq with him, settled them there, gave them.estates, fixed
salaries for them and deployed them as his bodyguards. He had rest
houses constructed along the roads to Makkah. Every house was fitted
with a cistern and a well. He entrusted the supervision of all this work
to Yaqteen bin Musa. He issued orders for the extension of the Basra
mosque and reconstruction of its pulpit.

Skirmishes in Undulus (Spain)
The governor of North Africa representing Mahdi was Abdur Rahman
bin Habib Fahri. He took a group of Berbers, landed at Murcia, on the
southeastern portion of the Spanish Mediterranean coast. Abdul
Rahman Fahri invited the governor of the province, Sulaiman bin
Yaqtan, to follow the Abbasid caliphate, he did not reply to the letter
of invitation. Abdur Rahman Fahri attacked Sulaiman's territory but
was defeated and pushed back. In the meantime, Amir Abdur
Rahman the Umayyah ruler of Spain arrived with an army. First, he
burned Abdur Rahman Fahri's boats on the coast so he could not get
away. Then he turned his army to face him. Abdur Rahman Fahri
became nervous and climbed up Mount Valencia. Amir Abdur
Rahman announced that whosoever brought Abdur Rahman Fahri's
head to him he would be given 1000 dinars. The news reached the
ears of one of Abdur Rahman Fahri's Berbers. He cut off his head in a
state of greed, took it to Amir Abdur Rahman and received the
reward. Amir Abdur Rahman was agitated at the invasion of the
Abbasids. He decided to retaliate by invading the Syrian coast and
punish the Abbasid caliph for his intrusion into Spain. But during that
same time Hasan bin Yahya bin Sayeed bin Sad bin Uthman Ansari
revolted in Spain and as a result Amir Abdur Rahman had to turn his
attention to him and postpone his plan to attack Syria. The dynasty of
Banu Umayyah ruled in Spain from the time of Caliph Mansoor
Abbasi and it was the second headquarters of the Islamic authority.
The period of Abbasids has been begun in our narrative and we will
finish recording the details of the rulers of the Abbasid Caliphate as
they continued to rule over the entire Islamic world except for Spain.

332

The History of Islam

The political conditions of Spain will be narrated separately from its
beginning in a following section.

The Roman Expedition and Haroon's attack
In 163 A.H., Mahdi collected soldiers from Khorasan and other
provinces and left Baghdad with the intention of declaring Jihad
against the Romans on 1 Rajab 163 A.H. On the previous day Mahdi's
uncle Isa bin Ali died. He left Hadi in Baghdad as his deputy and took
Haroon with him. He passed through Mousil and Jazirah, deposed
and imprisoned the governor of the province Abdus Samad bin Ali.
He then made his son Haroon the ruler of Azerbaijan, Armenia and all
the western territories and gave the authority of Jazirah to Abdullah
bin Saleh. The cause that led to the invasion of the Romans was that in
162 A.H. the Romans made incursions into Islamic territory and
destroyed some Muslim cities. Caliph Mahdi himself launched the
attack. During the journey when he came in front of Maslama bin
Abdul Malik's fort, Mahdi's uncle Abbas bin Ali said to Mahdi,
"Once when your grandfather Mohammad bin Ali passed this way,
Maslama had invited him to a feast and presented 1000 dinars to
him." When Mahdi heard this, he sent for Maslama's sons, slaves
and all his relatives and gave them 20,000 dinars and fixed salaries
for them. He reached Halab and stopped there and sent Haroon
along with the military commanders ahead . Haroon was
accompanied by Isa bin Musa, Abdul Malik bin Saleh, Hasan bin
Qahtaba, Rabi bin Yunus and Yahya bin Khalid Barmuk. Haroon
was entrusted with the command and also the supply and provision
of foodstuffs . He moved forward and laid a siege to the Roman forts
and conquered several of them in succession. In the mean time,
Mahdi searched for and killed apostates who left Islam and invented
various heresies to promote their political power in the vicinity of
Halab. Haroon returned victorious. Mahdi went to Jerusalem on
pilgrimage with Haroon. They perform their Salat in the Aqsa
Mosque and returned to Baghdad. When Mahdi had made Haroon
the governor of Azerbaijan and Armenia, he had handed over the
portfolios of finance and foreign affairs to Hasan bin Thabit and
Yahya bin Khalid Barmuk respectively.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

333

Haroon' s Second Invasion Against the Romans
In 164 A.H., Abdul Kabeer bin Abdur Rahman led an attack on the
Romans, religious leaders like Michael and Tara Armani faced him
with a 90,000 men and Abdul Kabeer returned back without combat.
This incident ended the terror, which the Muslim's invasion on the
Romans had created in 163 A.H. When Mahdi heard the news, he
imprisoned Abdul Kabeer, and in 165 A.H., he sent his son Haroon to
invade the Romans and asked his chief of security and confidant Rabi
to accompany him. Haroon attacked the Romans with a 100,000 man
army and continued defeating the Romans and destroying their cities
until he reached Constantinople. At that time, Constantinople was
ruled over by Ghustah, the widow of Emperor Elevik who ruled on
behalf of her underage son. The Romans agreed to a compromise and
paid 70,000 dinars annually as Jizyah for three years and it was agreed
that the Muslims would be allowed to transact business in the markets
of Constantinople. Prior to that reconciliation, the Muslims had killed
56,000 Romans and captured 600. That year Mahdi made Haroon the
administrator in charge of all the Western territories.
In 166 A.H., Caliph Mahdi made his son Haroon heir apparent after
Hadi and took the oath from the people for Haroon's succession and
gave him the title Rasheed, the guide. The same year he inaugurated
postal services using mules and camels to receive information and
communicate instructions to those territories. The same year he
appointed Abu Yusuf the chief justice of Basra.
In 167 A.H. Isa bin Musa died in Kufa. The same year saw the rise of
apostates who left Islam and invented various heresies to promote
their political power in various places. First Mahdi silenced them by
arguments and then prepared to kill them. Wherever he heard they
existed, he hastened to do away with them. In between Yamamah and
Bahrain, they grew in power. They became atheists, gave up prayer,
cared little for what was lawful or unlawful in religion, committed
looting and murder and to accomplish this blocked the roads . Caliph
Mahdi had them massacred openly when they engaged in these
criminal acts. He pursued them and exterminated them totally.
Among his achievements, the extermination of this type of criminals

The History of Islam

334

was very remarkable. The same year he extended the area around the
holy Ka'bah by purchasing the adjoining buildings.

Hadi's Invasion of ]urjan
In 167 A.H., news came that Tabristanis rose in mutiny. The caliph
dispatched his son Hadi to punish him. The flag of his army was held
by Mohammad bin Jameel. Hadi established peace in Tabristan and
Jurjan and punished the insurgents.
In 168 A.H., the Romans committed a breach of the agreement they
had with the Muslims four months before the time of its expiry.
Hearing this news the ruler of Jazirah and Qansareen, Ali bin
Sulaiman, sent Yazid bin Badr bin Batal with a large army to
Constantinople. He returned with a large quantity of spoils of war.

Mahdi's Death
Experience let Mahdi understand that his second son Haroon was
more capable and efficient in political affairs than Hadi. In 168 A.H.,
he made up his mind to supersede Hadi in the matter of succession
and put Haroon in his place by deposing Hadi and to take the
people's oath for Haroon. At that time, Hadi was in Jurjan. Mahdi sent
a messenger to bring him to Baghdad. Hadi was rude and impertinent
to the messenger, beat him up and turned him out of his court and did
not start to prepare to leave Jurjan for Baghdad to comply with his
father's orders. Hearing of this Mahdi left for Jurjan but as soon as he
reached Basbazan, he breathed his last on 22 Muharram 169 A.H.
corresponding to August 785 AD. Haroon Rasheed accompanied his
father on the journey and led the funeral prayer and sent news of their
father's death to his brother at Jurjan. Hadi took the oath from the
soldiers for his own caliphate and a circular regarding Mahdi's death
and Hadi's accession to the caliphate was sent to all the
administrators. Twenty days later, he left Jurjan and arrived in
Baghdad and took his seat on the throne of the caliphate he invested
Rabi, the chief of security, with the robe of minister. Rabi died a few
days later.
Caliph

J·

Mahdi was very noble hearted, pious, generous, even

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

335

tempered, brave and gentle among the Abbasid caliphs. During his
father's caliphate, he had seen with his own eyes the bloodshed of the
Aliwiites, which he did not consider as good for the government. By
his good behavior and works of public welfare, he wanted to endear
himself to the masses and thereby strengthen his authority. He
regarded fear, oppression, violence and fury as quite unnecessary. So,
he began to sit in the company of his courtiers and companions
without any inhibition. During Mansoor's regime, the courtiers and
companions used to sit behind a curtain and the caliph heard their
voices and they heard his. They wer~ not visible to others. During his
regime, Caliph Mahdi did not pass the death sentence against any
Hashmiite. He used to imprison those from Banu Hashim who
deserved capital punishment. He was a formidable enemy of the
apostates and never spared one from death yet Yaqub bin Fadl, a
Hashimite turned apostate who confessed himself to be so was only
imprisoned by him .and Mahdi said to his heir apparent Hadi, "When
you take over as caliph, you may kill him. I am committed to my oath
and so I cannot kill him." As soon as Hadi became caliph, he killed
him. Mahdi cared very much for the traditions and deeds of the
Prophet ~- He had all the special constructions in the mosques
designed for the caliphs demolished as they were against the
Prophet's way. Wherever there were pulpits higher than that of the
Prophet's it was brought down. He devoted most of his time in
prayer. He was very tolerant and eloquent.
Everybody could enter his court freely. In administrative affairs, he
was extremely active and clever. He used to visit his slaves and
servants when they were sick. Sometimes people filed cases against
him and in response to the judge's order he had to appear before the
judge as a defendant and implemented the judgment passed against
himself. A scholar of repute, Shareek, visited him. Mahdi said to him,
"You have to accept either of the three things. Accept the post of judge
or teach my sons or take your meal with me." Qadi Shareek thought
over it a little and then said, "Eating with you is much easier." So a
cloth was spread and a variety of dishes were served. When the eating
was over, the royal cook said, "Now you are trapped." and it
happened accordingly. After listening to the caliph, he not only
accepted the post of the judge but also trained his sons. Whenever

The History of Islam

336

Mahdi visited Basra, he led the prayer at the Central Mosque. One day
the people stood up for prayer. Then an Arab beduine came late and
he missed the congregational prayer. He said to Mahdi, "I wanted to
perform my prayer behind you but it was not possible." Mahdi
ordered that they should wait for that beduine at the time of every
prayer. So, at Asr time Mahdi stood up under the arch and did not
allow the prayer to be started until the beduine turned up. The people
were astonished at this courtesy:- Mahdi was the first caliph to have
recited the following verse in his sermon:

Hadi bin Mahdi
Hadi bin Mahdi bin Mansoor' s mother was Khaizran. He was born in
Rayy in 147 A.H. Khaizran was a Barber salve girl owned by Mahdi.
After Hadi and Haroon were born of her, he freed her and married
her in 159 A.H. When Caliph Hadi ascended to the caliphate he
punished the apostates in deference to his father's will and did not
hesitate in eliminating them. At the time of Caliph Hadi's ascension,
the following were the administrators of the provinces and states:
In Madinah: Omar bin Abdul Aziz bin Obaidullah bin Abdullah bin
Omar bin Khattab.
In Yemen: Ibrahim bin Muslim bin Qutaiba.

In Makkah and Taif: Abdullah bin Qatham.
In Yamamah and Bahrain: Sowaid Qaid Khorasani.
In Oman: Hasan bin Sulaim Hawari.
In Kufa: Musa bin Isa.

In Basra: Ibn Sulaiman.

In Jurjan: Caliph Hadi' s liberated slave Hajjaj.
In Qomas: Zeyad bin Hasan.
In Tabristan: Saleh bin Sheikh bin Omairah Asadi.
In Mousil: Hashim bin Sayeed bin Khalid.
Hadi had deposed Hashim for his rude behavior and deputed Abdul
Malik bin Saleh-bin Ali Hashmi in Mousil.

The Revolt of Husain bin Ali
Husain bin Ali bin Hasan Muthallath bin Hasan Muthanna bin Ali bin
Abi Talib and Hasan bin Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Hasan, his
uncle Yahya bin Abdullah bin Hasan and other descendants of Abu
Talib had joined hands in revolting against the Abbasid government
and it was agreed that the season of Hajj in 159 A.H. was the most
suitable time for the revolt. But before the Hajj season came there was
a quarrel between them and the governor of Madinah Omar bin
Abdul Aziz bin-Obaidullah. They rebelled> encircled the governor's
house and began to take the oath at Hasan bin Ali bin Hasan
Muthallath's hands and the people of Madinah joined it. In the
meanwhile, Khalid Yazidi arrived with 200 men. On the other side
Omar bin Abdul Aziz also came out of the siege and taking a group
with him came to the mosque where the oath for Hasan bin Ali's was
going on. Those who were inside the mosque fought. In this fight,
Khalid Yazidi and Idris were killed at the hands of Abdullah bin
Hasan's sons. With his death, all were defeated and Husain bin Ali's
group broke open the door of the treasury and looted the government
funds . The next day the supporters of Banu Abbas rallied and fought
again. The fighting continued in Madinah for several days. At last,
Husain bin Ali expelled all his opponents and took full control of
Madinah. He stayed in Madinah for 21 days and then left for Makkah.
After arriving in Makkah, he made a proclamation that those slaves
who came to him, would be freed. This induced a group of slaves to
rally round him. That same year Sulaiman bin Mansoor bin Sulaiman
bin Ali, Abbas bin Mohammad bin Ali, Musa and Ismail (Isa bin
Musa's sons) all belonging to the Abbasid dynasty had come for Hajj.
After their departure, Hadi came to know about Husain bin Ali's

338

The History of Islam

revolt. Hadi immediately wrote to Mohammad bin Sulaiman to fight
Husain bin Ali with his men. Mohammad bin Sulaiman had brought a
small army with him. He marshaled the troops in battle array at Towa
and reached Makkah and performed Umrah, (the small pilgrimage).
All the Abbasid chiefs who came from different provinces and
territories joined Mohammad Sulaiman, they arrayed and fought at
Fakh on 8 th Dhul Hijja. Many men were killed . At last, Husain bin Ali
suffered defeat and his men fled. After some time a man brought
Husain bin Ali's head. About 100 heads of his men were collected that
included Sulaiman's (Mohammad Mahdi's brother) . The defeated
took to flight and joined the pilgrims. Mohammad bin Sulaiman
proclaimed pardon and safety for all. Hasan bin Mohammad bin
Abdullah was arrested after the proclamation. He was killed by Musa
bin Isa. Mohammad bin Sulaiman was angered by this because it was
contrary to the promise he had given. When Hadi was informed, he
confiscated Musa bin Isa' s property. During this fight, Idris bin
Abdullah bin Hasan bin Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib (Mohammad
Mahdi's brother) escaped and went to Egypt. There Saleh bin
Mansoor's liberated slave Wazeh, who was the officer of the Postal
Department and sympathized with the descendants of Abi Talib, gave
him a fast horse and sent him to the western territories. Idris reached
the city of Dalilah located on the outskirts of Tangier and started
propagating to the Berbers. The account of his descendants will be
taken up separately later on in the narrative. A few days later Caliph
Hadi was informed that Wazeh had allowed Idris to escape to the
western territories. So, Hadi had Wazeh and his men arrested and
killed. Idris bin Abdullah's second brother Yahya bin Abdullah
escaped from Fakh and went to Delam.

Hadi' s Death
Soon after taking over as caliph Hadi became busy trying to depose
his brother Haroon from succession and install his own son Jafar in his
place. Yahya bin Khalid bin Barmuk was Haroon Rasheed's tutor, the
Prime Minster and in charge of all expeditions. He tried to make Hadi
see reason and abstain from this act. He succeeded in preventing him
from doing so several times but Hadi's other companions repeatedly
insisted on his deposing Haroon and replacing him with his son Jafar.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

339

Yahya convinced him saying, "Your son is still underage. If you die
today, the officials of the sultanate will never recognize his caliphate
and government and there will follow disturbances. Your father,
Mahdi nominated Haroon as crown prince after you. If you make
Jafar the heir apparent after Haroon, there will be no danger. If Jafar
comes of age in your life time and displays his capability, I shall
persuade Haroon to abdicate in favor of Jafar." Hadi was satisfied
with the argument. But the officials of the government who were
against Haroon continued to try to persuade Hadi until Haroon was
subjected to persecution. When Yahya came to know about it, he
advised Haroon to go somewhere on the pretext of hunting and
maintain a distance from Hadi. So, Haroon secured the permission for
hunting and went to the palace of Muqatil. When Hadi wanted to
recall him, he said he was ill and could not come to him. During the
same period, Hadi totally stopped his mother Khaizran from
intervening in matters of the administrators and deprived her of all
the powers she had enjoyed since Mahdi's regime. The estrangement
between the mother and the son took such an ugly turn that they
became mortal enemies to each other. When she came to know
through Yahya that Hadi was after Haroon's life to make his own son
Jafar heir apparent, she became a formidable enemy to Hadi for love
of Haroon. Now instead of one supporter Yahya, Khaizran also
became Haroon's supporter. When Haroon refused to present himself
before Hadi, he left for Mousil. When he returned, Haroon was with
him. Hadi fell ill on the way and died after three days on Sunday
night 14 Rabia al-Awwal 170 A.H. corresponding to 786 AD at Isabad.
He ruled for one year and three months. Hadi's sudden death led the
people to believe that Khaizran had Hadi poisoned to death by her
slave girl. Since Hadi was ill, poisoning did not find any credibility.
Yahya bin Khalid was her accomplice in the matter and it is Allah who
really knows.
Hadi introduced postal service in between Jurjan and Baghdad. He
was generous, even tempered and had a tendency towards
oppression. He was not unmindful of statecraft and politics. He was
stout and strong and soldier-like. He had a short span of life and the
duration of his caliphate was also very short. So his habits and nature
were not fully exposed.

History of Islam

Abu )afar Haroon Rasheed bin Mahdi
Abu Jafar Haroon Rasheed bin Mahdi bin Mansoor bin Mohammad
bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas was born of Khaizran at Rayy in 148
A.H. A week before Yahya bin Khalid' s son Fadal bin Yahya was
born. Haroon' s mother Khaizran suckled Fadal and Fadal' s mother
suckled Haroon, by Islamic law this made them foster brothers.
Haroon Rasheed succeeded to the caliphate on Sunday 14 Rabia alAwwal 170 A.H. after his brother's death. The same night his son
Mamoon was born. It is strange that the same night a caliph died, the
second caliph ascended to the throne and the third one was born.
Haroon Rasheed's familiar name, kunya, was Abu Musa followed by
Abu Jafar later on. He was a tall and handsome man.
Soon after coming into power, Haroon Rasheed made Yahya bin
Khalid Barmuk his Prime Minister. He not only entrusted him with
the portfolio of this ministry but also gave him the caliph's ring and
this made him the most important man in matters of expeditions of
the government. Khaizran who had been living in isolation from all
administrative activities in Hadi's time, again resumed her
involvement in matters of government. Assumption of authority by
Yahya and Khaizran does not signify that Haroon Rasheed remained
unconcerned with the business of the state. He rather wanted to
encourage and honor both Yahya and Khaizran. He believed them to
be his real supporters and relied upon their opinion. It was very wise
and intelligent on the part of a 23-year-old youth that he selected for
his minister a man who was very suited for that high post.
After taking the reigns of the caliphate in his hands, Haroon Rasheed
put all his efforts into strengthening the system of government by
means of dismissals, appointments, changes and transfers. He
replaced Omar bin Abdul Aziz bin Obaidullah by Ishaq bin Sulaiman
as the governor of Madinah. He sent Ruh bin Hatim to North Africa as
its governor. He separated the border areas from Jazirah and
Qansareen and formed a new Province named Awasim. In the first
year of his caliphate, he went for Hajj when the season came. He made
a parade of his generosity in Holy Cities.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

341

He deputed Ruh bin Saleh to collect Zakat, the wealth tax, from Banu
Taghlab in 171 A.H. There cropped up dissension between Ruh and
Banu Taghlab. Ruh collected an army to punish them but Banu
Taghlab launched a night attack on Ruh and killed him.
Idris bin Abdullah has already been mentioned and his fleeing from
the battle of Fakh to the western territories during Hadi's regime. He
started propagating his leadership among the Berbers, revolted in the
city of Dalilah in 172 A.H., took the oath from the people openly and
founded his_. own government in Morocco. That was the first
government the Allawiites were able to establish, and they succeeded
in Morocco - Andulus (Spain) in the Islamic world was a separate
country beyond the jurisdiction of the Abbasid caliphate. Now
another country Morocco also went out of their control. At the receipt
of the news Haroon Rasheed sent his slave Sulaiman bin Jareer
popularly known as Shumakh to Morocco alone to kill Idris bin
Abdullah. Shumakh reached there, took the oath for his caliphate,
endeared himself to him by criticizing and abusing Haroon Rasheed
and waited for a chance. In 177 A.H., he poisoned him to death and
returned. However, the government Idris founded continued. After
his death, a son was born to his slave girl who was also named Idris
by the Berbers and they made him their leader. The details about the
Idrisi government will follow later. After a short time, the Abbasid
authority was destroyed in Tunis and a separate government was
established there. The Abbasid caliphate remained there only as a
figurehead . In this way, a large part of their territory went out of the
control of the caliphate of the Abbasids.
In 172 A.H. Mohammad bin Sulaiman, the governor of Basra died.
Haroon Rasheed confiscated all his property and deposited it in the
treasury. Prior to this, Mohammad bin Sulaiman's brother Jafar bin
Sulaiman usurped much of the Muslims' wealth and accumulated
huge amounts of money for himself. After Mohammad bin Sulaiman' s
death, Jafar staked his claim to the legacy, Haroon Rasheed deputed
Ishaq bin Sulaiman as the governor of Sindh and Makran and
appointed Yusuf bin Imam Abu Yusuf to the post of judge in the
lifetime of Abu Yusuf.

342

History of Islam

Ameen as the Crown Prince
Haroon Rasheed' s son Mamoon' s birth has been recorded above, he
was born at the time of Haroon Rasheed' s ascension to the throne in
170 A.H. But Mamoon was born of Marja!, a Zoroastrian slave girl.
The same year his second son Mohammad Ameen was born to his
wife Zubaidah Khatoon bint }afar bint Mansoor bin Mohammad bin
Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas. Ameen's tutor was Fadal bin Khalid bin
Barmuk and Mamoon's tutor was Jafar bin Yahya bin Khalid bin
Barmuk. Fadal wanted Haroon Rasheed to make Ameen his heir
apparent and Jafar wanted Mamoon. Because Ameen was born of a
woman from Banu Hashim, Zubaidah Khatoon, Haroon Rasheed's
beloved wife also exerted all her effort in Ameen's favor . So, in 175
A.H. while Ameen was only five years old, Haroon Rasheed took the
oath for his succession.
The same year Haroon Rasheed deposed Abbas bin }afar bin
Mohammad bin Ash-ath, the governor of Khorasan, and appointed
Khalid bin Ata Kindi in his place.

The Revolt of Yahya bin Abdullah
Mention has been made above that Idris and Yahya, sons of Abdullah
bin Hasan and brothers of Mohammad Mahdi (Nafs Zaki ya) had fled
from the battle of Fakh. Idris went to the western territories and
occupied Morocco as has been mentioned above. Yahya bin Abdullah
rebelled against the caliphate of the Abbasids at Delam. People from
all sides rallied round him and took the oath for him, making him a
formidable power. Haroon Rasheed was frightened on hearing about
it and sent Fadal bin Yahya along with a 50,000 man army to put
down that trouble. Along with the army, he endowed him with the
governorship of Jurjan, Tabristan and Rayy. Fadal bin Yahya left
Baghdad and reached Talqan and wrote a letter to Yahya bin
Abdullah and asked him to obey the caliph and assured him of
rewards and landed estates if he reconciled with him. Yahya replied
that he was ready to make peace with Haroon Rasheed provided he
wrote the treaty of peace with his pen and had the signatures of legal
scholars and judges and the chiefs of Banu Hashim as witnesses. Fadal

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

343

bin Yahya informed Haroon Rasheed of all these details. Haroon
Rasheed was very glad. He wrote the treaty with his own hand duly
signed by the persons requested and sent it to Fadal with gifts. Fadal
sent it to Yahya bin Abdullah and both Yahya and Fadal left for
Baghdad. In the peace treaty the ruler of Delam who extended his
hospitality to Yahya bin Abdullah by lodging him at his fort and helped
him in all possible ways, was promised 1000,000 dirhams if he
persuaded Yahya bin Abdullah to sign the treaty of compromise. When
Yahya and Fadal reached Baghdacl., Haroon Rasheed received Fadal
warmly, fixed landed estates for him and gave him a reward. Fadal was
given a promotion and Yahya bin Abdullah was entrusted to Fadal bin
Yahya and he began to live in Baghdad under the care of Fadal.
In 176 A.H., Haroon Rasheed received news that the Egyptian
governor Musa bin Isa was influenced by the Alwis propaganda and
that he was busy maneuvering a revolution against the caliphate. So,
he made Jafar bin Yahya the supervisor of Egypt. Jafar bin Yahya
proposed Omar bin Mehran whose familiar name was Abu Hafs be
named governor of Egypt. He accepted it on the condition that when
he completed the arrangements for Egypt and deposited all the
arrears of taxes with the treasury, he would be at liberty to return and
that he would not have to seek permission to do so. Haroon Rasheed
agreed to the condition and wrote the certificate of governorship and
handed it over to him. He went to Egypt, took charge from Musa bin
Isa and after collecting all the taxes came back to Baghdad. Haroon
Rasheed then sent Ishaq bin Sulaiman to Egypt as its governor.

Unrest in Syria
In 176 A.H.,\he civil wars between Banu Mudar and the Yemaniyah
tribes took a dangerous turn. When the governor of Damascus Abdus
Samad bin Ali failed to stamp out the trouble, Haroon Rasheed
deposed him and replaced him with Ibrahim bin Saleh. Ibrahim
supported and helped the Yemaniyah tribes with the result that the
disturbance continued for a long time. Then the Mudar tribe captured
Damascus and dethroned and suspended the governor. Finally,
Haroon Rasheed sent Jafar bin Yahya Barmuk to Syria. He brought the
riots under control and came back to the capital Baghdad.

344

History of Islam

Rise of Attaf bin Sufyan
In 177 A.H. Atta£ bin Sufyan staged an uprising and captured Mousil
and the surrounding states. He besieged and imprisoned the governor
of Mousil in the governor's headquarters and started collecting taxes
using 4,000 warriors who were with him to convince' anyone who
doubted his right to collect taxes. Hearing of this Haroon Rasheed
took an army from Baghdad and went towards him. Atta£ fled to
Armenia. Haroon Rasheed pulled down the city walls of Mousil. But
he had to return to Baghdad upon receiving the news of uprisings in
both Egypt and Khorasan. Atta£ left Armenia and went to Raqah,
settled there and began to live a life of seclusion. The same year
Abdur Razzaq bin Humaid Dhalbi invaded the Romans and returned
after punishing them.

Uprising in Egypt
At the end of 177 A.H., the news came that in Egypt some tribes were
ready to rebel. The Egyptian governor Ishaq bin ~ulaiman tried to
stamp it out ~but in 178 A.H. the rebels fought and defeated him. In
those days, Harsimah bin Ayun was the administrator of Palestine.
Haroon Rasheed wrote to him to go to Egypt with his army and curb
the unrest. He went there and defeated and forced them into
obedience. Haroon Rasheed then entrusted the governorship of Egypt
to him. However, after one month he was deposed and replaced by
Abdul Malik bin Saleh.

The Mischief of the Khwarij
The periods during which there were rebellions in Egypt, Syria, and
Mousil Qais bin Dhalbah's liberated slave, Haseen Khwarji, had
rebelled in Khorasan and created unrest there. The governor of
Khorasan Khalid bin Ata Kindi had made Dawood bin Yazid the
administrator of Sistan. He sent Uthman bin Ammarah to confront
Haseen Khwarji . Haseen defeated and made him flee. Then he
looted and plundered Badghais, Busanj and Herat. Then Khalid
Kindi deployed a 12,000 man army to capture him. Haseen dealt a
crushing defeat to that army with his 600 men and continued to

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

345

create disorder and unrest. Repeated confrontations took place but
every time the Khorasani army suffered defeat. At last, in the
begi1ming of 178 A.H., Haseen Khwarji was killed and peace was
restored in Kilorasan. The same year saw Zafar bin Asim invading the
Roman Empire.
In Ramadan 179 A.H ., caliph Haroon Rasheed performed Umrah, (the
small pilgrimage,) combined with Hajj, (the great pilgrimage,) with
the same Ihram (the state in which a pilgrimage performs the rituals of
Hajj) . He went on foot from Makkah to Arafat. The.same year Malik
bin Anas .11,._,...~ died on 7 Rabia Thani at the age of 84 followed by
Imam Abu Hanifah's son Hammad in Dhul Qada 179 A.H.
In 180 A.H., armies were sent to Mawaraunnahar to declare Jihad on
the Turks and the Mongols. Ali bin Isa bin Mahan was made the
governor of Khorasan. This appointment was disapproved by Haroon
Rasheed's Prime Minister Yahya bin Khalid Barmuk who drew his
attention to Ali bin Isa's hard temperament. But Haroon Rasheed did
not agree with him and sent Ali bin Isa to Khorasan. Naturally, Yahya
bin Khalid did not like anybody to unleash a reign of terror on the
inhabitants of Khorasan, which was his native land. On the other hand
repeated rebellions in Khorasan demanded Haroon to depute a strict
man to govern and deal with Khorasan. The same year 180 A.H. there
was a big earthquake, which caused the minarets of Alexandria to fall
down. The same year the ruler of Spain, Hisham bin Abdur Rahman
died and his son Hakam took the throne. The same year Abu Bishr
Amr bin Uthman known as Sibwaih who was the foremost scholar of
syntax and an inhabitant of Baizia in Persia died.
In 181 A.H., Caliph Haroon Rasheed invaded the Roman Empire and
conquered the fort of Safsaf. The same year Abdul Malik bin Saleh
captured territories up to Ankara . The same year the Muslims and the
Romans agreed to exchange their prisoners of war. This was the first
treaty the Abbasids made with the Romans. The scholars and officials
of the two governments and 30,000 soldiers along with the inhabitants
of the border areas assembled at Lamas, which was situated at a
distance of twelve miles from Tartus. The ruler of Tartus also came
and under the aegis of Haroon Rasheed' s son Qasim popularly known
as Motamin and a grand assembly was held. The Romans came with

346

History of Islam

3,700 Muslim prisoners and in exchange, Motamin handed over the
Christian captives to them. The same year Harsamah bin Ayun was
deposed as the governor of North Africa. He came to Baghdad and
was appointed officer of Haroon Rasheed' s cavalry and in his place
Mohammad bin Muqatil was sent to North Africa.

Mamoon as Heir Apparent
It has been stated above that Haroon Rasheed in 175 A.H. had made
Ameen his son from Zubaidah Khatoon his heir-apparent. At that
time, both Ameen and Mai;r10on were five years old. No Muslim had
ever made his heir apparent a boy of such young age. Now Haroon
Rasheed declared his son Mamoon bin Marajal, then 12 years old,
heir apparent after Ameen. He took the oath from the people that
Mamoon would follow Ameen as heir to the caliphate. Mamoon's
real name was Abdullah and , Ameen' s was Mohammad. When
Mohammad was made successor in 175 A.H. he was given the title
Ameen and when Abdullah was made the second successor he was
given the title Mamoon. Haroon made him governor of Khorasan
and its adjoining territories up to Hamdan. Then he sent for Isa bin
Ali and giving him the certificate of governorship of Khorasan on
behalf of Mamoon, sent him back to Khorasan. The same year on 27
Rajah 182 A.H. Imam Abu Yusuf whose name was Yaqub and had
the credit of being Abu Hanifa's disciple and judge of judges of
Baghdad, breathed his last.

The Rebellion of Wahab bin Abdullah Nisai and
Hamza Khawarji
When Ali bin Isa visited Baghdad on the occasion of the celebration of
Mamoon Rasheed's succession, Abu Khaseeb Wahab bin Abdullah bin
Nisai revolted and began to loot and kill people in Khorasan. When
Isa bin Ali returned and pursued him, Wahab was terrified and asked
for pardon and safety which he was granted, he settled down quietly.
Immediately, after this incident the news broke that Hamza bin Atrak
Khwarji revolted in Badghais and started conquering city after city.
Herat was then ruled over by Amrwiyah bin Yazid Azdi. Taking 6,000
men with him, he attacked Hamza. Hamza defeated him and killed

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

347

many of his cavalry leading ultimately to Amrwiyah's death in the
stampede. Then Ali bin Isa gave 10,000 soldiers to his son, Hasan bin
Ali, and sent him to face Hamza. But Hasan did not fight with Hamza.
Then Ali bin Isa deputed his next son, Isa bin Ali. Hamza defeated
him and forced him to flee. Ali bin Isa gave Isa bin Ali a fresh army
and sent him to face Hamza. The fighting took place at Nishapur and
Hamza lost and fled to Qahistan. His 10,000 men were killed in the
battle and only 40 men were left who fled to Qahqistan with him. Isa
bin Ali deputed his warriors at Adaq, Jowin and those towns and
villag€s which helped Hamza and then caught and killed the Khwarij
until 30,000 men was put to death. Then he left Abdullah bin Abbas
Nasfi at Zaranrj to collect the spoils of war and marched on to Kabul
and Zablistan. Abu Khaseeb Wahab bin Abdullah who had received
pardon and safety and had settled down quietly in the town of Nisa,
saw the field empty and made up his mind to violate the treaty. He
was able to gather a group of rebels to rally round him and occupied
Abyuro, Nisa, Tus and Nishapur. On the other side, Hamza started
making night attacks on the villages and towns and looting travelers.
In short, Hamza and Wahab did not allow Ali bin Isa and his soldiers
to take any rest for four years. In the mean while Wahab at times
besieged Merv. At last with Wahab's death in 186 A.H. there was
peace in Khorasan. Then Ali bin Isa began to deal harshly and
violently with the inhabitants there.
The same year in 182 A.H. Abdur Rahman bin Abdul Malik bin Saleh
along with the summer forces left for the Roman Empire to make
Jihad. The Romans after the death of their King Constantine had his
mother Rebi succeed to the throne with the title Atshah. Haroon
Rasheed had created fear inside the court of Constantinople the
Roman queen eventually made endeavors to make ·peace with him
and drew the attention of the Muslim commanders to peace through
correspondence. It was at this time that the French King Charlemagne
conquered Italy and Western Rome and had an eye on Eastern Rome,
the kingdom of Constantinople. The Eastern Roman queen very
intelligently made a compromise with Haroon Rasheed and in
exchange for paying the Jizyah, she protected herself from the danger
of Charlemagne.

348

History of Islam

The Riot in the Province of Armenia
In 183 A.H., King Khakan's daughter Khazar was sent to Fadal bin
Yahya. She died at Baroa. When her men returned they told her father
that the Muslims had killed her treacherously. Khakan collected a
huge army and rebelled at Baba! starting the invasion of the Islamic
territories. The Armenian governor Sayeed bin Muslim was not able to
defeat him. Khakan killed 100,000 Muslims, captured thousands of
them with their women and children and tortured them to such a
degree that the description of these tortures is horrifying. This is
regarded as one of the greatest tragedies of the Islamic world. Haroon
Rasheed sent Yazid bin Mizyad to Armenia as governor prior to
which, he was the administrator of Azerbaijan. Armenia was also
annexed to his jurisdiction. He appointed Khuzaima bin Khazim at
Nasibeen to help the Armenians. As soon as Yazid bin Mizyad's and
Khuzaima bin Khazim's armies entered Armenian territory the
inhabitants of Khazar fled and the Islamic forces recaptured it.
Haroon Rasheed obliged Imam Musa Kazim ibn Imam Jafar Sadiq to
remain in Baghdad as a precautionary measure and did not allow him
to leave it for fear that the Aliwiites would make him their leader and
rebel. On Friday Rajah 25 183 A.H., I17.1am Musa Kazirrt died. He was
buried in Baghdad. He is regarded as the seventh Imam of the Shiites.
His and Imam Mohammad Taqi' s graves are located in Baghdad
under a dome and are known as Kazimiah.

Ibrahim bin Aghlab and the city of Abbasia
It has been stated above that Haroon Rasheed sent Mohammad bin
Muqatil bin Hakam as governor after Harsima bin Ayun's resignation.
Muhammad bin Muqatil was Haroon's foster brother. He put down
the rebellion in Africa, which was caused by Harsima bin Ayun' s
departure from Africa. Mohammad bin Muqatil cleverly and
intelligently disciplined them into obedient subjects but their silence
and obedience was under compulsion. They were ready to revolt at
any time, displeased as they were with Muqatil. The main cause of
rebellion was that he always consulted the administrator of the state
of Zab, Ibrahim bin Aghlab, who was in a secret conspiracy with the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

349

chiefs of the rebels and helped them and misguided Muqatil. Due to
the repeated rebellions in North Africa, 100,000 dinars from the
Egyptian treasury had to be spent annually on the upkeep, expenses
and defense of the North African government. Africa, instead of
creating revenue, had become a liability with the expenditure of
100,000 dinars per annum. Though Mohammad bin Muqatil restored
peace expenses to the Egyptian treasury continued as usual. Now
Ibrahim bin Aghlab requested Haroon Rasheed to make him the
governor of North Africa and in exchange not only would he
eliminate the 100,000 dinars per annum expense but would also send
him 400,000 dinars per annum as tax. He consulted his advisors.
Harsimah bin Ayun said that there was no harm in making him the
governor of Africa. So, Haroon Rasheed sent the certificate of
governorship to Ibrahim in Muharram 184 A.H. Soon after arriving in
North Africa he arrested all the ring leaders of the rebels who he knew
well and sent them to Baghdad. That put an end to all disturbances at
once. Then he founded a city near Qirwan and called it Abbasia. He
made it the capital. His descendants continued to rule over it, which
will be recorded later on in the narrative.
That same year 184 A.H. Haroon Rasheed handed over the
governorship of Yemen and Makkah to Hammad Berberi and sent
Dawood bin Yazid b_in Hatim as the governor of Sindh. Similarly, he
gave the governorship of Qahistan and Tabristan to Yahya Huraishi
and Maharaya Razi respectively.
In 185 A.H., the inhabitants of Tabristan attacked and killed
Maharaya. Then in his place Abdullah bin Sayeed Huraishi was sent.
The same year saw the death of the governor of Azerbaijan and
Armenia, Yazid bin Mizyad Shebani. His place was taken by his son
Asad bin Yazid.
As has already been stated, Ali bin Isa was able to stamp out all
rebellions in Khorasan and r~store peace after Wahab bin Nisai's
death in 186 A.H . Ali bin Isa was not lucky enough to enjoy peace for
long. A new intrigue was created against· him in Khorasan. The
Khorasanis continuously sent letters of complaints to the Caliph's
court. Yahya bin Khalid was not pleased with Ali bin Isa as the
governor of Khorasan. Yahya's younger sons Musa and Mohammad

350

History of Islam

who commanded respect and influence in Khorasan had incited
Wahab bin Abdullah and Hamza Khwarji to rebel. And it was due to
their covert activities that Khorasan continued to reel under the
impact of unrest and riots for years. During this period Haroon
Rasheed's attention was drawn by Yahya and Jafar to the necessity of
removing Ali bin Isa from the governorship of Khorasan. But he did
not listen to them on this point. When peace was restored, paper
horses started running. It was the result of instigation by the Barmuk
family that the Khorasanis began to write letters of grievances against
Ali bin Isa. When these letters became countless and the complaints
started pouring in that he not only crossed all limits by torturing and
persecuting civilians, he also was busy trying to topple the caliphate.
Haroon Rasheed, under compulsion, left Baghdad and camped at
Rayy. Hearing of the Caliph's arrival Ali bin Isa left Merv with gifts
and reached Rayy and called on him and offered proof of his loyalty
and sincerity. Being pleased, Haroon Rasheed retained him as the
governor of Khorasan and included Rayy, Tabristan, Nahawand,
Qomas and Hamdan under his jurisdiction.

Motamin as Crown Prince
The same year, in 186 A.H. Caliph Haroon Rasheed made his third
son Qasim as the third heir apparent. He took the oath from the
people that Qasim would succeed Mamoon as caliph and on that
occasion, he honored him with the title Motamin . While making
Motamin the third successor following Mamoon, the condition
included in the oath was that if Motamin proved himself capable, he
would succeed Mamoon otherwise Mamoon would be entitled to
remove him and make someone else the successor. He handed over
the reins of Iraq, Syria and the Arab countries to the first crown
prince. Mamoon was given the Eastern countries and Qasim was
. entrusted with Saghoor, Jazirah and the Province of Awasim. Ameen,
the first crown prince, was made to write an agreement that read:
"I shall fulfil my commitments to Mamoon" Similarly he made
Mamoon write one: I shall fulfill my commitments to Ameen."
These arrangements were duly signed by men of repute, the
elders, leaders of the army, officials of the government and the

The Caliphate of the Ab,basids (First Phase)

351

elders of Madinah and Makkah and it was hung on Ka'bah.
They were made to swear to remain content with what they
were given and avoid usurping the other brother's territories.
This was an order only concerning the matter of succeeding to
the caliphate.
First Ameen would be the caliph of the Muslims and Mamoon would
obey him. But Ameen would not have any authority to remove him
from the governorship of those territories, which were chosen by
Haroon. Mamoon would become caliph after Ameen and so on.
There were clarifications of these agreements, which were duly signed
by Ameen, Mamoon and the others, which were also hung up on
Ka'bah. Thus by dividing his sultanate among his sons Haroon
Rasheed wanted to rule out the possibility of any quarrel among them
in future . But this was not a wise step on his part and it probably was
his paternal affection that compelled him to do such a thing, which
was fated to end in failure .

A Remarkable Hajj of Haroon Rasheed
Caliph Haroon Rasheed was very fond of performing Hajj. He never
missed any except under the most compelling circumstances. It was
his regular practice to go for Hajj and Jihad every alternate year.
No caliph ever performed Hajj as many times as he did but the Hajj he
performed in 186 A.H. is specifically remarkable because it was
during this pilgrimage that the particular agreement mentioned above
was hung on the Ka'bah, and it was after this Hajj that he destroyed
the power of Barmuk family.
Haroon left Ambar for Makkah with the intention to perform Hajj. He
was accompanied by his three sons Ameen, Mamoon and Motamin.
Jafar bin Yahya, the Prime Minister, was also with him. Finishing the
Hajj, he left Makkah for Madinah. He enriched the people of both the
places with gifts and rewards. He distributed 10,500,000 dinar (gold
coins) as charity on behalf of himself and his sons. He returned from
Madinah and camped at Ambar. At this place, he had Jafar bin Yahya
Barmuk killed at the end of Muharram 187 A.H.

History of Islam

The Barmuk Family and Their Downfall
While recording the conditions of Caliph Haroon Rasheed's caliphate,
we have reached 187 A.H. In the beginning of this year, Haroon
Rasheed had his minister killed and his brother Fadal and father
Yahya imprisoned . In the lives of kings and caliphs killing a minister
and imprisoning their family is not an extraordinary or unusual event.
The histories of kings are replete with such incidents. The feats of
kings are written in blood. The ordinary events of the downfall of the
Barmuk family and Jafar's murder have assumed ugly proportions
due to the machinations of the lovers of tumult, tellers of false tales,
novelists and the ignorant worshippers of fantasies. Because there are
many educated yet misinformed persons and many fools giving the
impression of being wise who have misunderstand Mahmood
Ghaznavi and Aurangzeb Alamgir and lead others to follow them and
in the process damage the cause of Islam, it is necessary to expose the
falsehoods about Mahmood and Alamgir and present the facts.
Similarly false propaganda against the murder of Jafar and the
downfall of the Barmuk family should be narrated in detail in order to
separate reality from fantasy. Therefore, a detailed narration of the
events of 187 A.H . is in order. First of all a short history of the Barmuk
family will be followed by those false and unfounded narratives
which have found publicity among the ignorant and misinformed,
which have been quoted by and alluded to by many educated people
and then finally the real facts will be given.

The Barmuk Family
The oldest religion of the Iranians was Mah-abadi, which entailed
worship of the stars more than fire-worship. A number _of reformers as
revivers came one after another after Mah-a bad . The last of them was
Zoroaster. The religious legal system, which he brought into practice,
Allah alone knows. But from what is gathered, it shows that his
religion contained five-worship more than worship of stars. In his
lifetime, his religion became the royal religion and spread to most
parts of Iran. Asfandyar's wrestling spread it to Afghanistan and the
Punjab. The greatest of the Indian scholars Sangrachah Biyas visited

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

353

Zoroaster in Balkh, took an oath of obedience, returned to India and
started propagating fire-worship, which survives among the Hindus
in the form of hawan even today. Zoroaster's and his true devotee and
the renouncer of his kingdom, King Lahrasab' s, final resting place was
Balkh. Balkh is as important in relation to Zoroastrianism as
Jerusalem is in relation to Christianity or Buddhism is to Gaya (in
India) . Alexander of Greece destroyed Astkhar, Samarkand, Kangrah,
Karachi and Kabul by assault and plunder. This area was part of the
Zoroastrian kingdom of the Kyani family and it was this region where
fire-worship was in practi~e. The influx of Greeks not only put an end
to the Kyani kingdom but it also put out fire-worship. After some
hundreds of years the Iranians were able to shake off the Greek yoke
and Sasan I unified the multiple kingships and anarchy of Iran, picked
the sparks out of the Zoroastrian ashes and lighted its hearths. Balkh
had been made desolate by the Chinese during Zoroaster's time but it
was repopulated very soon and remained their holy city and their
direction of prayer. Alexander's flood had diminished the markets of
Balkh but it remained the pla~e of hope of the steadfast Zoroastrians.
It regained its youth again during the regime of the Sasanids. When
the Sasanids breathed their last on the battlefields of Qadsiyah and
Nahawand, the light of the hearths of Balkh increased all the more
because the defeated e_tn,peror of Iran and the rest of the escaping
leaders' place of assembly was in Balkh and it was to Balkh they
turned and worshipped Yezdan in the hearth known as Naubahar.
The spiritual leader of a hearth was called Mugh and the chief of the
Mugl1s, the superintendent of all hearths of his province and the Mugh
of this central hearth was known as Barmugh. Mugh the great spiritual
leader of the Naubahar hearth at the sight of the ruin and helplessness
of the greatest patron of fire-worship, the Iranian emperor, must have
been moved and thought that the religion of which he was one of the
leaders, was about to be humiliated and ruined and with it he and the
honor of his family would vanish. The hearth of Naubahar was one of
the four central hearths. This hearth commanded the greatest
popularity and grandeur for Balkh was considered to be the place of
Lahrasap' s slaughter, Zoroaster's place of residence and the_,center of
Zoroastrians. The Barmugh of Naubahar commanded the greatest
respect among the fire-worshipers and the Iranians. In 31 A.H., the

354

History of Islam

flood of the Muslim victors moved on to Merv sweeping the plain and
rolling off the mountains until they reached Balkh and the fire, which
was said to have been burning for thousands of years became extinct.
Neither the fire-worshippers survived nor the fireplace was needed
any more. No group was there to honor Barmugh nor was there
income for his luxuries. However, they maintained their title,
Barmugh and the victorious Arabs pronounced it as Barmuk. It is
incorrect to conclude that the Arabs put a stop to the fire worshippers
prayer and converted them to Islam by force by demolishing
Naubahar. Had the Muslims converted the fire worshippers to Islam
by force, they would have first converted Barmuk. They did not
disturb him rather the fire worshippers kept renouncing their religion
and embracing Islam by themselves. It was due to this conversion that
the Muslims scored victories wonderfully fast. Their arrival in Balkh
meant the arrival of Islam there and consequently, it led to the ruin of
the hearth of Naubahar and its Barmugh. Because Barmuk was the
religious leader, he did not accept Islam for the advent of Islam in the
country had damaged him in all respects. He looked on the Muslims
in anger. The Mongols and Turkish tribes along the Chinese border,
who had nothing to do with the Iranian nation and their religion but
were terrified of attacking Balkh, now began to raid. Consequently,
the same Mongol chiefs who promised to pay Jizyah to the Muslims
began to rule over Balkh and later on proved inconvenient to the
Muslims when they gained power. The Mongols removed all traces of
fire worship from Balkh and brought the Barmuk family to the level of
the lowest section of the society by dishonoring it. The Arabs did not
stay there long and internal quarrels did not let them tum their
attention to the borders much and thus Balkh remained the target of
attacks by the Mongols. The Barmuk who had seen the good and
prosperous days of Naubahar hearth and the Zoroastrian kingdom,
died. His son, who was a follower of Zoroaster, came to be known by
the same name. Barmuk II had not seen the golden days of Naubahar.
In 86 A.H. when Qutaiba bin Muslim, the governor of Khorasan,
invaded Balkh, a few women were brought into captivity and became
slaves. Barmukh II' s wife was among those who came into the share of
Qutaiba bin Muslim's brother Abdullah bin Muslim. After a short
time there was reconciliation with the people of Balkh, all the women

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

355

and captives were returned. So, Abdullah bin Muslim had also to
return the women. At the time of her departure she said to him, "I
have been made pregnant by you." When she reached Barmuk, she
gave birth to a child who was Ja'far Barmuk's grandfather named
Khalid. This narration may also be lumped with the same fictitious
and imaginary stories which are generally written by wonder loving
and wonder worshipping authors. However, Khalid was born at the
residence of Barmuk II either in 86 or 87 A.H. In 124 A.H., Imam
Ibrahim Abbasi sent Abu Muslim Khorasani as the officer and
superintendent of his propagation. Abu Muslim enrolled Khalid bin
Barmuk in his group when he was forty. Abu Muslim loved him very
much and paid special attention to his training and raising his status.
When Abu Muslim sent a man from Khorasan and had Abu Salmah
Khalal alias minister to the family of Mohammad murdered, he wrote
to Saffah to make Khalid Barmuk his minister. Khalid Barmuk
remained in that capacity until Saffah's death. After Saffah when
Mansoor Abbasi succeeded to the throne, he retained him as his
minister. In the first year of his caliphate, Mansoor had Abu Muslim
who was Khalid's patron, killed. Khalid did not show his resentment
or sorrow at his death. But Mansoor taking precautionary measures
sent him out on the plea of stamping out a rebellion and appointed
Abu Ayub as his minister. Since Khalid did not show his stubbornness
and disloyalty in any respect, Caliph Mansoor did not neglect to
utilize the services of such an efficient and capable man. Khalid's
future actions and attitude satisfied Mansoor. Khalid had the
experience of being a true disciple of a conspiring and courageous
man like Abu Muslim and was well versed in political matters. He
harbored dedication and love for Iran in his heart, he had seen with
his own eyes the end of Abu Muslim and while his lw c1r1 wa s
shedding tears of blood, he assumed the posture of a man d ee;·--· , !! 1<m
Abu Muslim and succeeded in concealing his real intentions : ,
alert and discerning man like Caliph Mansoor. He remained tlw
of the state of MoJ.1sil and the tutor to Mansoor's son. He maintai1wd
his status until the end of his life. To be the tutor of Caliph Mahdi
proved highly beneficial to him and to his family. He had cleverly
positioned himself to be the tutor of Mahdi . He survived Mahdi' s
accession to the throne and Mansoor' s death. This added more to his

356

History of Islam

honor and status. He died during Mahdi's regime, in 163 A.H., at the
age of 77. The second half of his life was spent in watching the birth
and death of caliphates and he had himself worked as a dominant
figure in ruining caliphates and founding new ones. At the time of his
death, his son Yahya was 54 or SO and he had also seen all these
games and disturbances soon after he came of age. He had inherited
from his father all thoughts, wishes, precautions and had heard with
reverence and sadness the stories of the ruin of his ancestors, the
honor of his family and the Iranian empire. He regarded himself as
the representative and religious leader of his nation. He knew it fully
that a slight error on his part might put an end to the respect and
influence he commanded in the Islamic caliphate and bring him down
to total destruction. On the other side, he and his father were fully
conversant with the internal and family affairs of the caliph. The
constant participation in the Caliph's court had kept his heart from
being overawed and shattered by the awe of authority.
Khalid Barmuk's deepest plot was this that in 161 A.H. he advised
Mahdi to make Yahya the tutor to Haroon Rasheed. As Mahdi himself
had remained under his tutelage, he thought it only natural to give his
son to Khalid's son to be coached and trained. Even before that when
Haroon Rasheed was born of Khaizran at Rayy, Khalid was with
Mahdi there.
It was Khalid again who was instrumental in making Haroon Rasheed
his foster grandson, Yahya's son Fadal, foster brothers by letting him
suck Yahya's wife's .milk and Fadal suck Khaizran's milk. If all these
wise steps of Khalid are studied deeply it becomes apparent that he
was able to protect his family very intelligently and beautifully for he
wanted to achieve a grand feat, that is, to avenge Abu Muslim's
murder and bring the ruling power back to the Iranians.

Yahya bin Khalid had educated and trained Haroon. He had
impressed Haroon so much that even after being caliph he used to
address him as "Respected father" and was shy of talking informally
in his presence. Caliph Hadi's caliphate was not in consonance with
the plans of the Barmuk family and Yahya had limited influence on
Hadi. Yahya thought out such a diabolical plan that Hadi'.s own
mother Khaizran turned against him. Their mother wishing to save

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

357

Haroon's life along with Yahya did away with Hadi by joining
together and Hadi was only able to rule for a little more than a year.
Yahya's bid for having Haroon accede to the throne was naturally a
bid in his own interest. As expected soon after being caliph, Haroon
made Yahya his Prime Minister and in charge of all the expeditions.
Yahya was not a fool to keep Haroon's mother Khaizran displeased.
He began to do everything in consultation with her and always
consulted her on every issue. After a short time, she died and Yahya
no longer had to perform even that formality. He worked with so
much concentration, sincerity and efficiency in the affairs of the
caliphate and expeditions that his love and respect in Haroon's heart
kept growing. He took great care and precaution not to make Haroon
feel constrained in any way in the expression of his free mind and
fulfillment of his heart's desire. It appeared that Yahya's only duty
was to try his best to see Haroon' s wish and intention fulfilled and
that was all. The greatest strategic move he made was that he
appointed and assigned quite imperceptibly his relatives, brothers,
nephews and like-minded Iranians to responsible posts in the
important states of the provinces and appointed many of them to be
leaders of the army. He had managed to make his sons Fadal and
Jafar brothers to Haroon Rasheed and Haroon called them his
brothers and loved them very much. Haroon had pyt his sons under
the guardianship and protection of Facial and Jafar and when Yahya
grew old in 174 A.H. he made his son Facial his assistant in the
ministry of expeditions.
When Yahya bin Abdullah rebelled in 176 A.H. at Delam, it was Facial
bin Yahya who settled it and had landed estates given to him. Haroon
entrusted Yahya bin Abdullah to }afar bin Yahya to keep him under
his custody. Haroon had also made Facial the governor of Khorasan,
Tabristan, Rayy and Hamdan in 178 A.H. He had made Fadal the
tutor to his son Ameen. During his governorship of Khorasan Yahya
prepared a strong and well-armed Iranian army of 500,000 men. After
a year, Haroon recalled him from there and appointed him Prime
Minister. Yahya was always consulted in all important matters, that is,
he continued to partake in all expeditions of the government.
Yahya' s second son Jafar had been Haroon Rasheed' s chief companion

358

History of Islam

and a very close friend. He always accompanied him at home and on
journeys. He was very sweet-tempered and methodical. In 176 A.H.,
he was entrusted with the governorship of Egypt in addition to his
being the inspector of Police of the royal palaces. Jafar sent Imran bin
Mehran to govern Egypt on his behalf and he lived in the service of
Haroon. When rebellions broke out in Damascus and Syria, it was
Jafar who went and put them down. Then Haroon made him the
governor of Khorasan. Hardly a month had passed when he was
made governor and city Magistrate of Baghdad itself.
Jafar entrusted this task to Harsimah bin Ayun and he himself
continued to be Haroon's companion. Haroon Rasheed sent for Yahya
bin Khalid and said to him, "Please tell Facial to hand over the
portfolios of the prime minister to }afar because I feel shy to tell Fadal
to hand over the job of prime minister to Jafar." So, Yahya, their
father, conveyed Haroon's intention to Facial and thus Jafar became
Prime Minister. This shows how much hold th.is family had on Haroon.
During the period of his ministry Jafar bin Yahya dominated over all
the posts and departments of the government so much that he came to
be regarded as the real owner and ruler of the government. All the
police and palaces of Baghdad were under him. It was he who had
brought and appointed the administrators of the states, governors of
the provinces and the commanders of the armies. He was the master
and superintendent of the treasury to such an extent that when
Haroon required money he used to ask Jafar for it. Yahya bin Khalid
had other sons too who were officers in the army. He and his sons
took great advantage of their authority and influence seamlessly and
intelligently. That is, they spent government money lavishly and
generously on gifts and rewards besides giving big revenues from
estates and setting salaries. Consequently, his generosity made him as
popular as Hatim. (This is in reference to Hatim Tai who is considered
the proverbial example of generosity in Arabic culture. Editor) There
was no one who was not an admirer and supporter of the Barmuk
family. They earned large amounts of money and spent the same
lavishly in purchasing their reputation and fame until not only in
Khorasan and Iraq but also in Syria, Egypt, Arabia, Yemen and far-off
countries the people eulogized their generosity and gifts in their odes.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

359

The honor, popularity and power of the Barmuk dynasty had touched
the zenith. Except for the fact that they had no accession to the throne of
caliphate, they had all the rest at their disposal. But in spite of all this,
they could not do anything against the intention of Haroon Rasheed .
Haroon Rasheed and his supporters had no chance to question their
power and grandeur. However, if hidden under this handling of power
was an evil design or rebellion, then there would be no enemy greater
and more formidable for them than Haroon Rasheed.
In the beginning of 187 A.H., it was suddenly witnessed that Haroon
Rasheed meted out to the dynasty of Barmuk the treatment which is
generally meted out to enemies. So we must observe and try to find
out whether the Barmuk family had really starting hatching a
conspiracy against his caliphate or not and whether Haroon Rasheed
came to know about it or not. If the Barmuk family had really an evil
intention against Haroon Rasheed and the Abbasid caliphate then
however he treated them in the end was absolutely right and lawful.
But if the Barmuk family was the same both internally and externally
and they were sincerely loyal to him, then none can be a worse judge
and tyrant than Haroon. For those who are accustomed to probe
superficially, the ruin of the Barmuks may be insoluble and they have
covered this knotty problem with the babblings of the inebriated and
propped it up to look like a reality.

The Advent of Nadir Khan in India
When Nadir Shah Irani landed on Indian soil and the Indian king
brought him to Delhi as a dear guest with peace and friendship,
someone in an intoxicated state at a bar said, "Ha! What a magnificent
work Mohammad Shah has done by bringing Qazalbash into the fort
and having him killed by female guards!" This mindless group with
these words let the heads of the Iranians in Delhi get chopped off. At
last being compelled Nadir Shah ordered a general massacre in Delhi
and it was of such a magnitude that Delhi had not seen the like of it
until date. So, it is in the same vein that someone has narrated the
cause of Jafar Barmuk's death and said:
" Haroon Rasheed Abbasi had a sister named Abbasah bint
Mahdi. He loved her very much. Similarly Jafar bin Yahya, the

360

History of Islam

Prime Minister was also his companion and friend who always
lived with him. Haroon used to drink with Jafar and Abbasah.
Just as he wanted his sister to participate in drinking, similarly
he wished his Prime Minister Jafar to keep company with him.
So, he had Abbasah married to Jafar so that their meeting and
seeing each other without a veil might be lawful. But Jafar and
Abbasah were sternly warned that they should not establish
physical relations with each other. But they failed to abide by it.
When Haroon came to know of it he had him murdered and
thus ruined his entire family ."
When the novelists and educated ignorant of our times laid their
hands on such nonsense, they polished it and propagated this
falsehood so much that he who reads these books reposes more faith
in it than Quranic verses and Hadith and does not like to hear
anything to the contrary.
This canard was authored hundred of years after Jafar's death and
Tabri has mentioned it in his book. As the incident contains novelty
and was uniquely narrated, wonder loving minds were inclined to it
and no one has missed recording this rumor since and we too
unfortunately have to refer to this unpleasant story. Tabri and other
historians have given other causes as well. But few of them have tried
to use wisdom and common sense by discriminating and selecting
genuine incidents.
1) Haroon Rasheed is the fifth caliph among the Abbasids. The
Abbasids prided themselves on being superior to all Arabs in respect
of family honor and race. The entire Arab world recognized their
ancestral superiority. It was their family honor that propelled them to
rise against Banu Umayyah and they met with success. When they
came into power as ruler and caliph of the entire Islamic world, their
pride of race increased even more. Arab prejudice and the sense of
respect were deeply ingrained in them . In this case, how was it
possible for a caliph like Haroon Rasheed to have his sister married to
a man that he regarded as a Zoroastrian slave's son and grandson of a
man of an unknown father? Admitted, he addressed Jafar as his
brother and his father as "respected father" because he was his tutor.
But at the time of marrying his sister, he could not overlook nation,

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

361

family and race. If he had turned liberal minded in respect of marriage
like the modern people, his relatives who had a single lineage and
were in good numbers, could not remain mute spectators at this
familial dishonor. Similarly, Abbasah too could not have tolerated
such humiliation.
2) It is beyond comprehension that a religious minded man like
Haroon Rasheed who went on Hajj and Jihad every alternate year and
who was the chief and caliph of the Islamic world could have held
drinking parties. If a caliph in Banu Umayyah had taken date juice
wine, it created a stir in the whole world and historians have
continued to mention this evil act in particular until the present.
However, Haroon Rasheed who visited the meetings of the scholars
and Allah-fearing devotees while alone and sat on tattered mats and
wept bitterly while listening to their sermons, how could he have
anything to do with wine an impure and dirty thing like urine? Elders
like Fudail bin Ayad, Ibn Sammak and Sufyan Thauri were his friends
and companions. A man who performs his Salat five times a day with
great regularity, with humility and piety especially the pre-dawn
prayer which is performed an hour and a half before sunrise, coupled
with hundreds of supererogatory prayers daily, how shameless and
injustice it is to call such a man drinker of wine. How can a man who
attended a wine party in the night participate in the pre-dawn prayer?
How can humility and piety be found in the prayer of a man who is in
the habit of taking wine?
3) The scholars in Iraq had given a fatwa about the legality of
nabeedh, a mixture of dates and water, and some wealthy people used
it but it cannot be connected with the intoxication found in wine. It has
never been proved that Haroon Rasheed ever used date-juice or held
such a party as mentioned in these false narratives. Until Haroon
Rasheed's regime the simplicity and military life of the Arabs
persisted which did not include taking wine. The Arab nobility
claimed by Haroon Rasheed always condemned wine as an evil so
much so that the nobles in the days of ignorance (the period before
Islam) never touched it nor did they consider it a proper act of the
nobility. That was why the Prophet~, Abu Bakr~ and many others
of the nobility of the Arabs never touched it even during the days

362

History of Islam

before Islam. Haroon Rasheed could not accept this lowness and
depravity in violation of the Islamic instruction.
4) Even in the present irreligious condition nobody, however mean
and low and addicted to taking wine in public he might be, would like
his sister to drink with him. The drinkurd people even they would not
like to start a drinking session with other men taking their sisters with
them. How could Haroon Rasheed Abbasi who had Tabiyyen, (those
who were with the companions of the Prophet ~ ) and Taba-Tabiyeen,
(those who were with the Tabiyyen,) at his court have committed such
a shameless act without dying of shame?
5) Those who are addicted to adultery, theft and drinking, generally
try to prevent their relatives from doing such things. If Haroon
Rasheed had been habituated to it, he could not have persuaded his
sister to follow suit. Probably his beloved wife Zubaidah, whom he
loved very much, would have been the first to partake it with him. But
none has indicated anything of this kind about her and her life is
impeccable on this matter. How surprising is it that there were regular
and constant recitations of the Qur'an at her palace while her dear
husband was drowned in wine?
6) The historians have written with confidence that there was a Jewish
doctor named Jibrail at Haroon Rasheed's court. He partook a meal
with the caliph and when he saw harmful things, he stopped him from
eating it. Once fish was served to the caliph and he wanted to eat it
but the doctor requested him not to and asked the cook to take it
away. By chance, one of the caliph's servants found Jibrail eating the
same fish at his residence. Then it was suggested that the doctor
himself wanted to eat it and so prevented the caliph from consuming
it. The servant communicated this to Haroon. It was a small incident
and Haroon Rasheed could have said nothing to him except laugh it
off. When the doctor came to know that the caliph was informed of
the incident, he put three pieces of the fish into three separate bowls.
He put meat and other things eaten by the caliph into a bowl and
mixed them. He put ice water in the second bowl. He then poured
wine in the third bowl. Then he presented the three bowls before the
caliph and said, "The first two bowls contain what you have eaten and
the third contains what I have eaten." When he looked into them, he

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

363

found that the contents had rotted and were giving off a bad smell.
However, the bowl that contained the wine and fish had not rotted .
The doctor saved himself from being put to shame and explained to
the caliph, "As I take wine, the fish was not harmful to me. And as
you do not take wine, I stopped you from eating it." This episode
bears proof that Haroon Rasheed abstained from wine.
7) Actually, Abbasah was married to Mohammad bin Sulaiman. When
he died and she became a widow, she was then married to Ibrahim
bin Saleh bin Ali who was Haroon Rasheed's close relative and
descendent from Abbas. To attribute such a falsehood to such a noble
and pious lady is a proof of the lowness of the liar. He who tries to
prove falsehood to be a fact is certainly a man of devilish nature. The
strangest point in this allegation is that Haroon took care of following
the Islamic law in finding a legal way to allow Jafar and Abbasah to
look at each other but he forgot the Islamic law concerning drinking.

The Reality Behind the Extermination of the Barmuks
Power and kingdoms are objects that create enmity between two
brothers and between father and son. The histories of governments
and kingdoms bear witness to this. The Abbasids killed without any
hesitation anyone whom they thought to be harmful to their authority .
When Caliph Mansoor saw that Abu Muslim wanted to capture
power, he put him to death at once. Sometimes the companions and
officials of kings and rulers take advantage of this habit and nature
and they attempt to prove a man, who they want to be harmed by the
king, to be a rebel. The officer of Mansoor's bodyguards was Rabi bin
Yunus who descended from Uthman bin Affan's servant Kaisan. He
was the greatest confidant of Mansoor and he also was his advisor. He
wielded much power and authority during Mansoor's regime. It was
Rabi who is said to have advised him to kill Abu Muslim. Mansoor
made Abu Ayub his minister in place of Khalid Barmuk but in 153
A.H., he appointed Rabi bin Yunus instead. At Mansoor's death, it
was he who managed the oath of Mahdi's caliphate. During Mahdi's
caliphate, he retained his post as minister but since he was known as
the Hajib (literally the covering or in the political sense one who
speaks for the caliph without actually involving him), Mahdi made

364

History of Islam

Abu Abdullah Muawiya bin Yasar his minister also and assigned to
him most of the departments of the government. After some time,
Rabi had Abu Abdullah censured, deposed and jailed. Then Mahdi
appointed Yaqub bin Dawood. He was also censured and removed
after some time. Then he selected for the job Faiz bin Abi Saleh who
came from a Christian family in Nishapur. In short, Rabi bin Yunus
did not let any minister succeed and he remained the only important
minister. When Hadi' s caliphate was established after Mahdi's, Rabi's
authority reached its pinnacle because Hadi had invested him with all
powers. It was at his insistence that Khaizran was distanced from
dabbling in state affairs. Hadi and Rabi died almost at the same time.
Rabi's son Fadal bin Rabi expected to be appointed to a high post but
soon after coming into power Haroon handed over the entire
administration of the caliphate to Yahya bin Khalid. Yahya bin Khalid
belonged to Abu Muslim's group as has been mentioned above. He
hated Rabi bin Yunus because it was he who was instrumental in
having Abu Muslim murdered and doubt cast upon Yahya's father
Khalid bin Barmuk and had him deposed as minister and had his own
friend Abu Ayub appointed. Yahya bin Khalid did not let Fadal bin
Rabi get a post and by retaining the post of Hajib for himself, he
snatched away all his powers and reduced him to being totally
ineffectual. It is clear that there existed old and strong enmity between
the Barmuk family and Fadal bin Rabi. With the rise of the Barmuk's
power, Fadal bin Rabi's enmity and hatred also increased. However,
since Haroon fully relied upon the Barmuks, Fadal could not harm
them. In such a situation, there was only one alternative for Fadal and
that was to find real proof of the Barmuks' disloyalty, betrayal and
rebellion and then guide the Caliph against them and thus serve his
purpose. Since Barmuk was very experienced, clever and alert, Fadal
bin Rabi could not find any opportunity to have him accused but he
continued to study all his activities minutely. The Barmuks had
collected so many supporters by virtue of their generosity and
endowments of wealth that Fadal bin Rabi found it difficult to find a
confidant. Haroon wanted to give him a post in view of his old and
ancestral connections but since his mother Khaizran was angry with
Fadal and his father Rabi for trying to limit her influence in the time of
Hadi, she insisted that her son stop trying to assist Fadal bin Rabi and

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

365

Yahya supported her on this point. When she died in 174 A.H. Haroon
recruited him as the head clerk of his accounts office and then Fadal
bin Rabi had a bit more influence than before.
When Yahya bin Abdullah came from Delan with Fadal bin Jafar,
Haroon Rasheed wanted to imprison him despite the treaty he had
written. First, he sought a fatwa (religious decision) from some
scholars. Hearing this tl,e Barmuks recommended Yahya bin
Abdullah to the Caliph because the latter shared Abu Muslim
Khorasani's faith and supported the partisans of the Prophet's family
internally. Haroon Rasheed put Yahya bin Abdullah under Jafar bin
Yahya's charge and asked him to keep him under his custody. Jaf~r
kept him with respect and comfort.
When Haroon Rasheed sent Ali bin Isa as the governor of Khorasan in
180 A.H., Yahya bin Khalid as stated earlier, opposed that
appointment. That was perhaps Haroon Rasheed' s first act that he did
in defiance of Yahya bin Khalid's intentions and wishes. As Yahya, his
sons and relatives had been dominating all the countries, the Barmuks
did not give Ali bin Isa any rest. Yahya's son Musa bin Yahya pooled
up all his resources and started inciting rebellions and breaches of the
law one after another. Ali bin Isa came upon it by chance as to who
engineered all the disturbances in Khorasan. He dispatched a letter to
Haroon briefing him on the situation and complaining against Musa
bin Yahya. This complaint and the contrary complaint of Yahya's
created a doubt in Haroon Rasheed' s mind. As a result when news
after news regarding Ali bin Isa's preparation for revolt started
pouring into the caliph's court, Haroon Rasheed did not send any
Amir or commander to him. Rather he himself marched to Khorasan
with his army. He encamped at Rayy in 186 A.H. He had a slight
doubt and he never doubted the Barmuks. He did know that the
Barmuks disliked Ali bin Isa living in Khorasan. When Ali bin Isa sent
letters against Musa bin Yahya and Yahya bin Khalid's other sons and
relatives that they created mischief in Khorasan, Haroon Rasheed's
attention was seriously drawn towards the problem of Khorasan. He
did not disclose to the Barmuks nor could they know by themselves
how curiously and minutely the Caliph was watching them. They had
the letters of complaints against Ali sent to Haroon Rasheed. Had they

366

History of Islam

realized that Haroon Rasheed was casting doubtful eyes towards
them, they would never have sent them and would never have
accused Ali bin Isa of revolt. When Haroon Rasheed arrived at Rayy,
Ali bin Isa paid a respectful visit to him and told him in detail about
the situations in Khorasan. He informed him that the whole of
Khorasan and all its provinces were in the grip of the Barmuks and
they were completely ready to avenge Abu Muslim Khorasani's death.
Understanding this one can well imagine how seriously Haroon
Rasheed was affected by this shocking news. Knowing how
dependant he was on the Barmuks and realizing the implications of
their activities in Khorasan was a nightmarish scenario for him to
contemplate. He encouraged Ali bin Isa and sent him to Rayy and he
returned with his emotions fully suppressed and buried in his heart.
After Ali bin Isa had left, Fadal bin Rabi, who finally had concrete
evidence against Jafar Barmuk, communicated the shocking news to
Haroon Rasheed that Jafar Barmuk had released Yahya bin Abdullah
who had gone somewhere to prepare to lead a revolt. When meeting
Jafar and in the course of their talk, Haroon Rasheed asked Jafar about
Yahya bin Abdullah. Jafar told him that he was still under house
arrest. Haroon Rasheed asked him whether he could say that under
oath. This made Jafar extremely nervous and he realized that the
secret was out. He steadied and said, "Yahya bin Abdullah has been
living under my care for a long time and I did not apprehend any
danger from him. So I did not see any harm in releasing him." This
was the most critical point for Haroon Rasheed . If he had shown his
displeasure at that moment, the Barmuks would have never come
under his control and would then have made use of all those
resources, which they had made available both materially and
morally. Confrontation with the Barmuks was no easy job for Haroon
Rasheed and probably they would not have given him breathing time
and would not have let him make a sign indicative of distress, because
25 persons among Yahya bin Khalid's sons and grandsons were men
of letters and sword who remained present at his palace in different
posts on the grounds. They had under their possession the keys to the
administration and provisions for all territories. All the military
commanders were appointed by them and they were all loyal to them.
All the administrative officers and high officials were their appointees

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

367

The Scholars, Legal Experts and spiritual leaders were not out of their
control because they served them much and obliged them. All the
poets were their admirers. They were popular with their subjects by
virtue of their generosity and so from the west to the east they had
become liked by the people al large. They had made such large scale
and fool proof preparations that several Haroon Rasheeds would not
have succeeded. But Haroon Rasheed steadied himself and after
hearing about Yahya bin Abdullah's release from Jafar said carelessly,
"I simply asked you about him by the way. That you have let him go
is very good. I was myself about to ask you to release him right now."

It is easy to imagine that the release of a person like Yahya bin
Abdullah was in reality a shock to Haroon Rasheed. The Alawiites'
revolt did not give the Abbasids any rest throughout their reign and
Yahya bin Abdullah was not an ordinary man whose freedom from
captivity could be insignificant to Haroon Rasheed. Anyway, Haroon
Rasheed succeeded on this occasion and concealed his feelings. At that
same time, another incident took place. On the occasion of some feast,
the officials of the government and Iranian chiefs were present.
Somebody said, "How intelligently Abu Muslim transferred the rule
from one dynasty to another." Jafar said, "It was not a praiseworthy
piece of work because he did it by killing 600,000 people. It would
have been more admirable if it was done quietly." There was someone
at the party who heard and narrated the incident to Haroon Rasheed
who was sure that Jafar was the man who wanted to do it himself.
Then in order to put the Barmuks off their guard he started drafting
the documents for distributing the powers of succession and territory
among his sons. This was the kind of work that was not expected to be
taken up by a caliph who was aware of a serious conspiracy against
him. This was the greatest allusion and trap that Haroon Rasheed led
the Barmuks into. He could neither spend much time in the affairs nor
could he put the Barmuks off their guard for long. So, in 186 A.H. he
came back to Rayy, took bay'at for Motamin's succession, prepared the
deed of distribution and had the treaty written and duly signed by
Ameen and Mamoon. Then he went for Hajj, gave alms to the needy,
came to Madinah, gave away rewards and alms and returned. He
then arrived at Ambar and suddenly on the last night of Muharram,
he killed Jafar, put his father and brother into captivity and did not

368

History of Islam

give anyone a chance to move against him.
Haroon Rasheed reached Ambar and one night he sent for his Hajib
Masroor and said to him, "Take a reliable body of Sarhangis an._d go to
Jafar's tent, call him to the door and cut off his head and come back."
Masroor was horrified to hear it. But Haroon Rasheed said to him
silently, "This order of mine must be complied with without any
delay." Masroor left at once, went to Jafar's tent and came back with
his head. That same night Caliph Haroon Rasheed put Jafar's father
and brothers into jail and at once issued an order that Jafar's, Fadal's
and Yahya's property wherever it was must be confiscated . Then all
the members of the Barmuk dynasty were arrested and sent to jail,
and all their appointees were removed from all responsible posts in
the government. Thus, Haroon Rasheed in a single night succeeded in
warding off the danger of the Barmuks and heaved a sigh of relief. He
achieved this feat in such a manner that no one had time to create any
opposition. He very much relied on Yahya bin Khalid's brother
Mohammad bin Khalid Burmuk's loyalty and it is possible that he
might have revealed some secrets to Haroon Rasheed. He was not
arrested. On the other hand a respectable member of Haroon
Rasheed's family Abdul Malik bin Saleh bin Ali bin Abdullah bin
Abbas who was his grandfather, entered into the conspiracy with the
Barmuks because he was promised to be made caliph. After taking the
Barmuks captive, Haroon Rasheed held Abdul Malik bin Saleh captive.
Abdul Malik bin Saleh' s son Abdur Rahman stood witness against his
fathE:r and Abdul Malik remained in captivity. Mamoon set him free
during his regime. Ibrahim bin Uthman bin Naheek was also an
accomplice in the conspiracy and was put to death. Yahya Barmuk and
Fadal Barmuk died in captivity in 190 A.H. and 193 A.H. respectively.
As the Barmukis gave money to the people thoughtlessly and
patronized the poets, the people in general who were unaware of the
reality, felt shocked and they declared Haroon Rasheed a tyrant. Tne
poets wrote elegies, the storytellers narrated their generosity and
qualities with exaggeration. Haroon Rasheed did not make
information of the conspiracy public and issued strict orders against
any discussion about the Barmuks. During his regime, the public in
general never found out the real cause of the removal of the Barmuks.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

369

Had the public come to know about the betrayal and conspiracy of the
Barmuks, Haroon Rasheed and the government of the Abbasids
would have lost their hold and it would have given rise to new
conspiracies. It was his foresightedness that he did not make any
public statement about them and by so doing kept the people terror
stricken, overawed and puzzled and this was most suited to keeping
the rule of the Abbasids intact. If the common people were allowed to
air their views about the fall of the Barrimks, their supporters and
admirers who were present everywhere in great numbers might have
opened their mouths and the wind of opposition might have started
blowing against the Abbasids. In this particular case, no other strategy
was more suitable than the one he adopted.
The Barmuks claimed to be the lovers of the Prophet's family and
supporters of the descendents of Abi Talib. The Alwites took their
ruin as a personal loss and even today, the partisans of Ali ~ and
partisans of Husain 4'>, are found mourning over their death and
destruction. Their love for knowledge and patronage of the scholars is
narrated exaggeratedly and colorfully although that Zoroastrian
family did.not do any extraordinary or significant service to Islam and
the Muslims. The cause of their death and destruction is quite evident
and there is no room for doubt, in order to save his sultanate Haroon
Rasheed killed the Barmuks as a king who destroys his enemies to
safeguard his kingdom. He held also grand father a captive with
Barmeeks. There is no need to mix speculative and nonsensical
theories with a matter that is clear.

Other Events of Haroon's Regime
We have reached 187 A.H. in recording conditions and important
events of Haroon Rasheed's regime. After the incident of the Barmuk
family, Haroon Rasheed sent his son Motamin to the province of
Awasim, Motamin invaded Rome and sent Abbas bin Jafar bin
Ash' ath to lay siege to the fort of Sanan. The Romans failed to put up
any resistance and by returning 320 Muslim prisoners made a
settlement with the_ Muslims. During the same period, the Romans
deposed their queen and made a commander Nagfoor their king.
Mention has already been made that the Romans, out of fear of the

370

History of Islam

French king Charlemagne after his capture of Italy made peace with
Haroon Rasheed. The first thing Nagfoor did after assuming power
was to make an agreement with the French King and after settling the
matter of jurisdiction with him wrote a letter to Haroon Rasheed:
The Queen, because of her natural weakness and too much
pressure, came to terms with you and continued to pay you the
Jizya. This was from her foolishness. Now you must repay all
the taxes you have collected from us and promise to give
payment as a fine or we will punish you with our swords.
When this letter was received and read by Haroon Rasheed, he flew .
into such a rage that the officials and ministers around him had no
courage to remain sitting there and left the court silently. Haroon
wrote on the back of the same letter:
In the name of Allah who is most Beneficent and Merciful. From
Amir al-Muminin Haroon Rasheed to the Roman dog. You, the
son of unbelief, I read your letter. You will see its reply with your
own eyes. You need not read it. That is all.
He wrote the above reply and sent back the letter. The same day he
left Baghdad with the army for the Roman territories, arriving there
he besieged its capital Herculah. Nagfoor was at a loss and finding
himself powerless to resist, begged him to be excused and promised
to pay him the Jizya. Having defeated and humiliated him Haroon
returned after exacting a promise from him to pay more Jizya than
before. He had hardly reached the city of Riqqah when Nagfoor
violated the peace treaty and prepared to rebel. He was sure that
due to winter the Muslim soldiers would not dare to launch an
attack on them. However, as soon as Haroon heard this news he left
Riqqah, entered Roman territory and conquered and destroyed
many forts. He continued to capture Roman territory until he
confronted Nagfoor, who pleaded for forgiveness again. Haroon
collected the full amount of tax and brought most parts of the
territory under his control.
The same year, 187 A.H. Ibrahim bin Adham died. (Ibrahim Adham
was a prince from Balkh who gave up his worldly power and wealth
to become an ascetic.)

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

371

In 188 A.H., the Roman King Nagfoor gave indications that he was
going to rebel again. Ibrahim bin Jibrail from Safsaf invaded Rome.
The Roman Emperor himself came out to fight . However, he could not
stand the pressure, was decisively defeated and left 40,000 Roman
soldiers dead while he escaped. The Islamic army returned victorious.
In 189 A.H., caliph Haroon Rasheed went to Rayy and made
adjustments in the administration by deposing and appointing new
administrators in the provinces west of Khorasan. He consoled and
encouraged Marzaban Delam by sending him a certificate of pardon
and safety. The elders and rulers of the border regions visited him and
assured him of their loyalty. He made Abdul Malik bin Malik the ruler
of Tabristan, Rayy, Qumas, and Hamadan. The same year another
exchange of prisoners between the Romans and the Muslims took
place. The same year Imam Muhammad bin Hasan Shibani, Abu
Hanifa's disciple died at AI-Zambuwaih near Rayy and the same day
Kisai Nahvi also died. Both had been in the company of Haroon
Rasheed. He joined the burial service and when he returned from the
graveyard, he said, "We have buried both Fiqah and Nahw today."
In 190 A.H., Haroon Rasheed made his son Mamoon his deputy at
Riqqah, handed over to him all the affairs of the government and
invaded Rome with 135,000 soldiers following Nagfoor's violation of
the peace treaty. He surrounded the fort and after thirty . days, he
conquered it and captured and killed the Romans. Then he sent
Dawood bin lsa bin Musa with 70,000 soldiers to capture other Roman
forts. This army shook up the entire Roman Empire. During the same
period Sharjeel bin Maan bin Zaidah captured Saqaliah, Dalbashah
and other forts. Yazid bin Mukhlid and Abdullah bin Malik
conquered the forts of Qauniyah and Mukhallad respectively.
Humaid bin Mayuf, the Admiral, repaired the Syrian and Egyptian
fleet and invaded Cyprus, defeated the inhabitants and took the entire
island as spoils of war and brought 17,000 men as captives. Then
Haroon encircled Tawwanah. In short, the Muslims made up their
mind to create an upheaval in the Roman Empire, put an end to and
settle the frequent battles once and for all. Nagfoor felt helpless he
accepted to pay the taxes and sent a sum of 50;000 Asharfis to Haroon
on behalf of himself and on behalf of his son and the bishops. He sent

372

History of Islam

an appeal to Haroon requesting him to return a certain woman from
among the captives of Herculah for she was betrothed to his son. The
caliph granted his request and sent back the said woman. Taking pity
upon Nagfoor for his entreaties and humility, he returned his country
to him in exchange for 300,000 Asharfis and the normal taxes.
Immediately after his return, the Romans revolted again. The same
year 190 A.H. Khalid bin Yazid bin Hatim was made Governor of
Mousil and Harsimah bin Ayun was entrusted with the task of
constructing the fort of Tartoos. 3,000 soldiers of Khorasan and 1,000
soldiers of Masisah and Antakya were busy constructing the fort of
Tartoos. It was completed in 192 A.H. The same year Kharmiyah in
Azerbaijan revolted. Abdullah bin Malik with 10,000 soldiers was sent
to punish him. He defeated the rebels and killed the captives and put
an end to the mischief. The same year on 3 Muharram 190 A.H. Yahya
Barmuk died in Riqqah in captivity. He was 71 . His funeral service
was led by his son Fadal bin Yahya.
In 191 A.H ., Haroon Rasheed made Muhammad bin Fadal bin
Sulaiman the governor of Mousil. The Governorship of Makkah was
given to Fadal bin Abbas.

Rebellion in Khorasan
It has already been mentioned that when Ali bin Isa was appointed
governor of Khorasan, the Baramuks incited Wahab bin Abdullah and
Hamza bin Atrak to revolt. Wahab was killed but Hamza survived
and escaped and he continued to plunder in the area. Ali bin Isa, the
Amir of Khorasan, deputed Yahya bin Ash'ath the Administrator of
Samarkand and Mawaraunnahr. There was a famous chief in the
army of Mawaraunnahr named Rafe bin Lai th bin Nasr bin Sayyar
who was linked with the organization of the Barmuk family. He hated
Caliph Haroon and Ali bin Isa. Yahya bin Ash'ath married a certain
woman and Rafe bin Laith became involved with her and she wanted
to be divorced from Yahya but he would not divorce her. Rafe
suggested a way out saying, "Announce that you have become an
atheist and present two witnesses. Your marriage with him will
automatically be terminated. Embrace Islam after that and then I shall
marry you." She acted upon his advice and by this trickery married

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

373

Rafe. It was a technique to annul the marriage, this was probably
the first time this legal trick was used. Yahya bin Ash'ath sent a
detailed report about all these events to Haroon Rasheed. He wrote to
Ali bin Isa the governor of Khorasan, to separate the woman from
Rafe, and exercise the Islamic law concerning his case, mount him on a
donkey and display him in Khorasan. So, in compliance he was
separated from her and sent to jail in Samarkand. One day he escaped
from the jail and went to Ali bin Isa, the governor, in Balkh. Ali bin Isa
wanted to execute him but his son made a recommendation for him
and Ali bin Isa ordered him to be sent to Yahya bin Ash'ath in
Samarkand. Rafe arrived there and killed the administrator and
occupied Samarkand.
At this news Ali bin Isa sent his son Isa bin Ali to Samarkand. Isa bin
Ali was killed in the fighting. Then Ali bin Isa, taking his army, left
Balkh and came to Merv before Rafe could capture it. This occurred in
191 A.H. Caliph Haroon Rasheed heard about Rafe's crimes, deposed
Ali bin Isa from the governorship of Khorasan and deputed Harsimah
bin Ayun in his place. The fact was that all the chiefs of the Khorasan
army and the members of the Baramuk's group had joined Rafe.
Harsimah bin Ayun arrived in Samarkand and besieged Rafe. Rafe's
defense continued for a long time.

The Death of Haroon Rasheed
After punishing the Romans, defeating and humiliating Nagfoor and
collecting all taxes from him, Haroon Rasheed returned to Riqqah.
Here he was apprised of the crimes of Rafe bin . Lai th and the
disloyalty of some Khorasani leaders. He made up his mind to go to
Khorasan. ~e made provisions for the army, left Riqqah in Shaban
192 A.H. and then marched on to Baghdad. While departing, Haroon
made Motamin his deputy at Riqqah and Khuzaima bin Khazim his
assistant. He then made his son Ameen his deputy in Baghdad and
ordered Mamoom to stay with him there. Mamoon's scribe, Fadal bin
Saha!, said to Mamoon. "It is not proper for you to remain with
Ameen in Baghdad try to accompany the Caliph." Mamoom
requested from his father to be allowed to accompany him and he
granted it. Just as Haroon was about to leave Baghdad, Fadal bin

374

History of Islam

Yahya Barmuk died in captivity in Muharram 193 A.J:-{. When he was
busy fighting the Romans, he became sick and reached Riqqah in the
same state of illness. When he came to Baghdad, he was still ill and it
was in that condition that he left for Khorasan with the army. The
Caliph left Baghdad and reached Jurjan in Safar 193 A.H. His illness
took a turn for the worse there. He made an announcement before all
the military commanders at Jurjan. "Whatever army and military
equipment with me at the moment, it will remain attached to
Khorasan and Mamoon. He is the commander and owner of all these
armies and all the commanders will obey him." Relieved in this way
from Mamoon's position Haroon Rasheed sent him to Merv in the
company of leaders like Abdullah bin Malik Yahya bin Ma'az, Asad
bin Khuzaima, Abbas bin Jafar bin Muhammad bin Ash' ath and Nairn
bin Hazim. After sending Mamoon to Merv, he went to Tus. He was
then accompanied by Fadal bin Rabi, Ismail bin Sabih, Mansoor Ha jib
Husain and Jibrail bin Bakhtishu. At Tus his condition worsened and
he was bed-ridden. We have read above about the fight between
Harsimah bin Ayun and Rafe bin Laith. Bukhara was conquered and
Rafe's brother Bashir bin Lai th was arrested. Harsimah sent him to the
Caliph's court. When Haroon was in his sickbed, Bashir was led into
his presence. Haroon ordered his death and he was killed very
mercilessly. After giving the execution order, Haroon became
unconscious. When he regained his consciousness, he ordered a grave
to be dug in a corner of the home where he was staying. When it was
ready, a few Quran readers descended into it and recited the whole
Quran. He had his cot shifted to the graveside and lying on it he
continued to look at the grave. In that state, he died on the night of 3
Jamad Thani 193 A.H. corresponding to 24 March 808 AD. His funeral
service was led by his son Saleh. He had been Caliph for 23 years and
two and half months. His grave in Tus is well known.
Haroon Rasheed was married to Zubaidah bint Jafar bin Mansoor.
Her kunya was Umm Jafar. Muhammad Ameen was born to her. Ali,
Abdullah, Mamoon, Qasim, Motamin, Muhammad Mu'tasim, Saleh,
Muhammad Abu Musa, Muhammad Abu Yaqub, Abu! Abbas, Abu
Sulaiman, Abu Ali and Abu Ahmad all were born to his slave-girls.
Among his sons, four are famous Ameen, Mamoon, Mu'tasim and
Mohasin. Mohasin was not literate and so Haroon did not regard him

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

375

fit for succession. However, he became caliph and many of his
descendents were Abbasid caliphs and Haroon Rasheed's line
continued through him. Just as he left many sons at the time of his
death, he left many daughters as well who were all born from his
slave-girls.
Haroon Rasheed should be considered as the high point in the
Abbasid dynasty. The Abbasid caliphate became powerful and
touched its zenith during his administration. The descendents of Abi
Talib and other conspiring groups felt discouraged inl.'> their efforts. He
was a great lover of knowledge and cared very much for Islam. He
completely uprooted the evil of atheists. The Christian Empire of
Rome paid taxes to him. He left 900,000,000 dinars in the treasury at
his death. He was the ruler of the entire Islamic world except Spain
and Morocco. It was during his period of rule that the work of
composition and compilation of the Islamic sciences was begun in
earnest. The Jewish and Christian scholars were honored and
patronized in the court of Baghdad. He endowed the Christians with
military commands and kept them in his company as friends. During
his Caliphate, the Indian scholars reached Baghdad directly or
through the Governor of Sindh and they were all honored. Books in
Hebrew were translated and the compilation of various sciences and
arts were introduced. During his rule, the life of the people was
comfortable and they enjoyed a high level of wealth and prosperity.
Poetry and music also flourished in Baghdad in this period. Story
tellers wrote fictitious and fanciful tales about Haroon, which became
popular in the world and created a good deal of misunderstanding
about him (this is a reference to 1001 Nights among other works) .
Haroon Rasheed was a brave and military-minded man. He spent
months and years happily in the saddle of his horse . And when he
was in the company of the ascetic, he appeared to be an ascetic, and
when among the legal scholars, he was a legal scholar of the first order
and similarly when sitting with scholars of the Prophet's traditions, he
was an excellent scholar in this field as well. He was an enemy to the
atheists, with the followers of other religions he dealt kindly and
sympathetically. He was extremely fond of three things Hajj, Jihad
and charity. He was very sensitive and softhearted. Whenever anybody
sincerely lectured him and made him fear hell, he wept bitterly.

376

History of Islam

One day Ibn Sammak was sitting with Haroon. Haroon felt thirsty and
he asked for water and water was brought. When he wanted to drink,
lbn Sammak said: "O Amir al-Muminin! Stop a moment." Haroon
Rasheed said, "Yes?" Ibn Sammak said, "If you can't get water when
you are most thirsty, how much will you spend to get a bowl of
water?" Haroon Rasheed said, "I shall exchange it for half of my
realm." Ibn Sammak said, "Now, you may drink." When he finished
Ibn Sammak said, "O Amir al-Muminin! If this water remains in your
abdomen and does not come out, how much will you spend to take it
out?" Haroon Rasheed said, "Half of my realm if need be." Ibn
Sammak said, "Enough. Now you must know that the price of your
whole realm is equal to a bowl of water and a bowl of urine. You must
not be proud of it." Haroon Rasheed burst into tears and continued to
weep for a long time.
Once Haroon Rasheed requested a righteous and ·pious man to advise
him. He said, "If your friend is such as makes you fear leading to
good results he is better than the friend who makes you careless of
and indifferent to fear leading to bad results." Haroon Rasheed
requested him to explain what he said. He replied, "If anybody who
tells you that on the day of judgment you will be questioned about
your subjects and so you fear Allah much it is better than he who tells
you that you are from among the family of the Prophet (ci) and that by
virtue of your proximity to the Prophet (ci), all your sins will be
forgiven." Hearing it he wept so much that those sitting near by began
to feel pity for him,
Qadi Fudail says, "Except two Kings there is none who has
undertaken a journey for religious knowledge during his student
days. One is Haroon Rasheed who along with his sons Ameen and
Mamoon went on a journey to listen to the Mu'atta of Imam Malik and
the manuscript that was read from is available with the Egyptian
Kings. The second is Sultan Salahuddin Ayyubi who traveled to
Alexandria to give audience to the Muwatta of Imam Malik.
Haroon Rasheed was interested in polo and archery. He was 45 when
he died. Doctor Jibrail bin Bakhtishu committed an error in treating
him and that was why the Doctor was considered pro Ameen and his
Hijab, spokesman, Masroor was considered a supporter of Mamoom.

While Haroon was on the journey, his condition continued to worsen
and his son Ameen wrote some letters addressed to Haroon Rasheed' s
companions and sent them through Bakr bin Al-Motamir. Those
letters were purported to have been written for the sake of the oath
being taken for his caliphate, presuming Haroon Rasheed dead. One
letter was addressed to his brother Saleh to come to him at once with
all the army, equipment and the treasury after consulting Fadal bin
Rabi . The same types of letters were addressed to other companions of
Haroon Rasheed. A similar letter was written to Fadal bin Rabi. The
letters assured all the chiefs they would be retained in their respective
posts. Haroon came to know of the event and the arrival of Bakr bin
Almotamir by chance. He sent for him and questioned him about the
purpose of his visits. When he failed to give a satisfactory reply, he
was imprisoned.
Haroon Rasheed died after this incident. Fadal bin Rabi had Bakr
released from the jail and he distributed Ameen's letters. When the
leaders went through them, they had consultations. As all were eager
and anxious to go back to their native land Baghdad, Fadal bin Rabi
was able to take all of them to Baghdad and the orders left by Haroon
and their commitments to Mamoon were all forgotten.

Ameen Rasheed bin Haroon Rasheed
Muhammad Ameen bin Haroon bin Mahdi bin Mansoor Abbasi was
born to Zubaidah Khatoon. Ameen and Mamoon were the same age.
Haroon had set Ameen to be Caliph after him and making Mamoon
the permanent ruler of Khorasan and other eastern countries. He
exhorted Ameen not to depose Mamoon from the governorship of
Khorasan and advised Mamoon not to disobey Ameen. When Haroon
Rasheed died as Tus, Mamoon was in Merv and Ameen was in
Baghdad. Saleh was »7ith Haroon Rasheed. The day after his death the
41h of Jamad-at-Thani 193 A.H. the chiefs and soldiers of Haroon's
army took the oath at Saleh's hands in Tus for Ameen's caliphate. The
officer of the Postal Department Hamwaih at once informed his
deputy in Baghdad of the incident. He therefore conveyed to Ameen
the news of Haroon's death and Ameen's ~uccession. Saleh bin
Haroon also reported the matter to his brother Ameen and

378

History of Islam

congratulated him on becoming Caliph and sent to him the caliph's
ring, staff and coverlet. At that time Haroon Rasheed' s wife and
Ameen' s mother Zubaidah Khatoon was in Riqqah and the caliph's
treasury was under her procession. At the receipt of this news, Ameen
went to the central mosque and delivered a sermon to the people. He
narrated how Haroon died and took the oath from the people. At this
news Ameen's mother along with the royal treasury left Riqqah for
Baghdad. Ameen went to Ambar to receive her and brought her to
Baghdad with great honor. When Mamoon in Merv heard the news of
his father's death, he assembled all the Amirs and commanders and
sough their views as to what he should do. Notables among them
were Abdullah bin Malik, Yahya bin Maaz, Shabeeb bin Humaid bin
Qahtabah, Allamah Hajeb Abbas bin Zuhair, Ayyub bin Abi Sameer,
Abdur Rahman bin Abdul Malik bin Saleh and Fadal bin Sahal.
Mamoon and all these leaders had been with Haroon Rasheed on the
journey from Baghdad to Jurjan. During the journey, Fadal bin Saha!
tried to attract the commanders and other leaders to Mamoon and
many of them assured him that they would join Mamoon's
supporters. However, Fadal bin Rabi who was Ameen's supporter
arrived in Tus and after Haroon's death and due to Fadal bin Rabi's
efforts all who were present in Tus, took the oath for Ameen and went
to Baghdad without thinking that they should have paid a visit to
Mamoon in keeping with Haroon's will that Mamoon was the owner
of all the armies and provisions of the journey. All the chiefs who
were with Mamoon supported him as the ruler of the eastern
countries. Some of them advised him that Fadal bin Rabi was still on
the way and he could be brought back with the help of the army. But
Fadal bin Sahal disapproved it saying, "If they are brought back in
this way, there is apprehension that they will play false and prove
harmful. Although, it is certainly proper that those who professed
obedience and promised help and sympathy should be contacted
through messenger and be reminded of their promises they made to
Haroon Rasheed in response to his will." So two messengers were
sent. When they visited Fadal and the others, they found them to be
their adversaries. Some abused Mamoon openly. They barely escaped,
with their lives and returned with great difficulty then they reported
all they had seen with their eyes. Mamoon was sure that he would not

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

379

be allowed to bring under his control the eastern countries, this made
him very worried and thoughtful. Fadal bin Saha!, in the east, took up
the gauntlet to make Mamoon the caliph. There were people among
Ma moon's men who disliked him to be the caliph but wanted him to
remain in power the eastern countries. But Fadal bin Sahal and his
friends did not like Ameen's caliphate and were in favor of Mamoon
to be the caliph. Fadal bin Sahal's father Sahal was a new Muslim who
was originally a Zoroastrian who embraced Islam in Haroon
Rasheed's times and it was Haroon who appointed his son Fadal as
clerk to his own son Mamoon. Because of his cultural preferences, he
wanted to make Mamoon the Caliph.
The fact was that Ameen' s mother, Zubaidah Khatoon, was a
Hasimiite which gave him the support of the Arabs. Mamoon's
mother was Iranian by race therefore, the Iragians and the Khorasanis
supported Mamoon. Ameen was present among the Arabs in
Baghdad and Mamoon was among his supporters the Iranians in
Merv. Zubaidah Khatoon hated Mamoon. The Arab leaders who
supported the Abbasids disliked the Alawiites. However, in Khorasan
the supporters of the Alawiites were found in large number. Jafar
Barmuk, who supported the Alawiites, was Mamoon's tutor.
Therefore, Mamoon was more popular in the eastern countries like
Khorasan. Fadal bin Rabi who hated the Baramuk family was
displeased with Mamoon. In brief, Mamoon and Ameen's intentions
were not clear and not without selfish concerns and they were
surrounded by leaders, who were divided into two groups both
antagonistic to each other. Therefore, immediately after Haroon' s
death both these groups under the leadership of Ameen and Mamoon
started a trial of strength and were not pleased with each other. In
order to win the hearts of the Khorasanis one quarter of their taxes
were excused in addition to promising them a grant of honor and
promotions for the Khorasani leaders. The Iranians were overjoyed
and said, "Mamoon Rasheed is our sister's son. He will definitely raise
our status and authority." On the other side Mamoon called the
scholars and legal experts of Merv and said, "Please influence the
people through your sermons and keep the situation under control."
Under the prevailing conditions, the wisest step that Mamoon
Rasheed took was that he wrote to Ameen Rasheed fervently trying

380

History of Islam

his best to assure him of his respect and loyalty.

If Caliph Ameen Rasheed had been patient and far-sighted, Mamoon
Rasheed would have probably become involved in something illegal
and uncalled for and would have been declared guilty and
blameworthy in the eyes of the people and probably would not have
succeeded. However, Fadal bin Rabi and the other counselors did not
prove worthy and Ameen did not show any trace of wisdom. All his
activities convinced the people that he was not capable to run the
caliphate. As soon as he assumed power, he committed the first
mistake. He deposed his brother Qasim, Motamin, from the
governorship of the Jazirah leaving him with the provinces of
Qansareen and Awasim only in the beginning of his caliphate and
deputed Khuzaima bin Khazim to Jazirah. The same year, on the
advice of Fadal bin Rabi, he wanted to replace Mamoon by his own
son Musa bin Ameen as the heir apparent and this gave Mamoon a
chance to oppose him justly. At the time when Haroon Rasheed was
going to Khorasan, he had announced that the army and the entire
supply of weapons and provisions would be under the authority of
Mamoon and that he would be in charge. However, Fadal bin Rabi
took the entire army, weapons and the provisions which were present
at the time of Haroon's death, to Baghdad leaving Mamoon very
weak. Fadal bin Rabi had the apprehension that if Mamoon succeeded
Ameen as Caliph, he would deal harshly with him. He tried to have
Mamoon deposed from the succession to protect himself. Ali bin Isa,
the governor of Khorasan, considered himself in the same position so
he seconded Fadal's proposal and persuaded Am~n to remove
Mamoon. When the issue was put before Khuzaima bin Khazim, he
dissented from it and stopped the Caliph from undertaking this action
for the time being. This news continued to reach Mamoon but he kept
quiet and waited for the results.

Rafe and Harsimah in the Service of Mamoon
It has been stated above that Harsimah had laid a siege to Rafe at
Samarkand and Rafe was still at large when Haroon died in Tus.
Rafe's brother, Basheer, was arrested and brought to Haroon Rasheed
who had him killed.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

381

After Haroon's death Harsimah bin Ayun entered Samarkand by
force and occupied it, at the time he was accompanied by Tahir bin
Husain. Rafe escaped and ran away from Samarkand and took refuge
with the Turks. He came back with a Turkish army to fight with
Harsimah but he lost this battle. Rafe became estranged from the
Turks and he became very weak. He sent his messenger to Mamoon
and begged for pardon and safety. Mamoon granted it to him and he
came to Merv in his service. He was given a warm reception.
Harsimah visited Mamoon and Mamoon made him an officer of his
cavalry. It was during the same period that Mamoon deposed Abbas
bin Abdullah bin Malik from the governorship of Rayy.

Ameen and Mamoon as open Rivals
Ameen received the news in Baghdad that Mamoon had made
Harsimah an officer of his cavalry and accepted Rafe as his
companion with honor and deposed Abbas bin Abdullah as the
governor of Rayy. He was justifiably displeased to hear this and
expunged Mamoon' s name from the Friday sermon and entered his
son's name as heir apparent. He then sent Abbas bin Musa bin Isa bin
Jafar and Muhammad bin Isa bin Naheek to Mamoon with the
message, that said, "Agree to my son superceding you as heir
apparent and make an announcement to the effect that Musa bin
Ameen is the heir apparent in your place." Mamoon rejected this and
Fadal bin Saha! took advantage of the situation. He converted Abbas
bin Musa to his camp secretly and persuaded him to remain stationed
in Baghdad and work as to spy and communicate any important
information. Ameen had asked Mamoon to withdraw from the
governorship of a few states in Khorasan, which he refused
immediately. When Mamoon was informed that his name had been
removed from the Friday sermon in Baghdad, he also deleted
Ameen' s name from sermons is Khorasan. Ameen tore up the
document that was hung on the Ka'bah by Haroon. This occurred in
the beginning of 194 A.H . From this point forward Mamoon Rasheed
had the right to oppose Ameen openly. Mamoon very carefully sealed
Khorasan so that no letter or messenger of Ameen' s could enter it and
create any unrest or revolt there.

382

History of Islam

Unrest in the Provinces
When the new's of the enmity between the two brothers caused by the
removal of the document from the Ka'bah and tearing it into pieces,
and the removal of their names from their respective sermons became
common knowledge, forces that breed on dissension began to appear.
Khagan, Tibet, the lands of the Turks and Kabul territories that paid
their taxes and were loyal to the Islamic authority, began to revolt.
The news upset Mamoon however, on the advice of Fadal bin Sabal he
wrote mild letters to the Kings of those lands, excused the taxes of
some and allowed concessions to some and thereby strengthened the
bond of reconciliation with them. Mamoon' s worries were short lived
and no disturbances inside his territory were created because most of
the Khorasanis supported Mamoon wholeheartedly and wanted to
defeat Ameen who was supported by the Arabs. Negative forces of
dissension caused unrest, and disturbances surfaced in the provinces
under Ameen and they proved more dangerous to him. Only one man
from among the Banu Umayyah dynasty had survived named Ali bin
Abdullah bin Khalid bin Yazid bin Muawiya. His mother was _Nafisah
bint Obaidullah bin Abbas bin Ali bin Abi Talib. He was known as
Siffenane. He used to say," I am the son of the chiefs of Siffen, that is,
Muawiya's and Ali's son." He was educated and wise. Seeing Ameen
and Marnoon preparing to confront each other he revolted in Syria
and the Syrian tribes, which had connections with Banu Umayyah,
joined him. Ameen sent his army to Syria and it was defeated. Syria
remained unstable for several years. At last in 198 A.H., Siffenane
was defeated by some other Syrian tribes and he fled from Syria and
the Syrians captured Damascus. When Ameen had the document of
Ka'bah torn into pieces, Dawo'o d bin Isa refused to obey him and
contended to the inhabitants of Madinah and the Hijaz, "Ameen is
unjust to Mamoon. What we have promised before to Haroon
Rasheed, we should keep it and we must never take the oath of
succession for Musa who is only a babv." His efforts bore fruit and all
the inhabitants of the Hijaz recognize. Mamoon as Caliph and
removed Arneen's name from the Friday se,nions. Dawood bin Musa
then left Makkah for Merv via Basra, Persia and Kerman and apprised
Mamoon of_ the situations in the Hijc> · ' .f amoon was very pleased

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

383

with him and appointed him governor of Makkah. That occurred in
196 A.H. In brief, disobedience and rebellions damaged Ameen
considerably. Mamoon suffered no damage or loss and that was a
pointer to the fact that Ameen was wanting in his capability of
governing the land.

The Romans
Just a few days before Haroon Rasheed's death the Roman emperor
Nagfoor was killed in the battle of Barjan. His son succeeded him after
his death. He also died after two months. Then his sister's son-in-law
Michael bin Jarjees sat on the throne. When the Romans rebelled
against him the next year 194 A.H., he left the capital and joined a
band of ascetics. Then the Romans chose their commander in chief as
their King. In short, at the time when internal riots and disturbances
were taking place in Haroon' s government, the Roman Empire was
not free from similar complications.

The Tug of War between Ameen and Mamoon
During the last days of 194 A.H., Ameen removed Mamoon as heir
apparent and Mamoon expunged Ameen' s name from the Friday
sermon. After that, Ameen not only replaced Mamoon by his own son
as heir apparent but also deposed his brpther Motamin and replaced
him by his other son Abdullah as second heir apparent. Now Musa
and Abdullah' s names were read in the sermons. There was nothing
to stop Ameen and Mamoon from fighting with each other for
superiority. Mamoon conferred the title of Dhurriyasatain on Fadal
bin Saha! and appointed him as the Prime Minister. Tahir bin Husain
bin Mus'ab bin Zaraiq bin Asad Khaza'i was made commander-inchief of the army. Fadal bin Saha! went to the border state of Rayy and
recruited veteran soldiers and by recruiting the people of the border
regions formed an army and gave it to the commander. Tahir- bin
Husain appointed Abul Abbas Khazai the Commander of the army of
Rayy, Abul Abbas equipped and fully armed his troops. On the other
side, Ameen Rasheed sent Esmat bin Hammad bin Salim with an
army of infantry to Hamadan and ordered him to stay there and send
the vanguard to Sadah, then he prapered a huge army under

384

History of Islam

commandership of Ali bin Isa bin Mahan and sent it to Khorasan to
face Mamoon. It was a great mistake on the part of Ameen and his
Minister Fadal bin Rabi to send Ali bin Isa as commander to Khorasan
because the inhabitants of Khorasan had been displeased with Ali bin
Isa when he was governor there. As soon as they heard about his
approach, they became determined to fight even more. Ameen
handed over to Ali bin Isa Nahawand, Hamadan, Qum and Isfahan as
feudal estates for him and gave him cash and equipment for more
than his needs, he sent him a 50,000 man cavalry. He issued
commands to all the administrators and officials to send
reinforcements and every type of aid to him. When Ali bin Isa came to
Ameen's mother Zubaidah Khatoon to say good-bye to her, she
instructed him to refrain from showing disrespect to Mamoon if he
was captured. In Shaban 195 A.H. he set out from Baghdad. Caliph
Ameen along with officials of the government went with them for a
little distance. The army was so large and impressive that the people
of Baghdad had not seen t~e like of it before. When Ali oin Isa arrived
near Rayy, his companions advised him to make fortifications and
assign a vanguard. But Ali said, "Fortifications and vanguards are not
needed to fight a man like Tahir." Hearing the news of Ali
approaching near, Tahir also left Rayy and at a distance of five miles
from Rayy, they clashed. Ali bin Isa had more than 50,000 fighters
while Tahir had only 4,000 men. The distinction of strength between
the two armies was so great that Ali bin Isa said to his men at the time
of forming lines. "They need not be killed. They should be surrounded
and captured ." Seeing the huge army some of Tahir bin Husain' s men
fled at the time of marshalling of the troops in battle array and came
to Ali bin Isa to reap the benefits of belonging to the victorious side
and be safe from defeat. However, Ali bin Isa broke the rebels up and
turned some out and captured others. This benefited Tahir
considerably making every soldier in his army. ready to fight for his
life. Tahir bin Husain's right and left flanks were defeated by Ali bin
Isa's right and left flanks and they fled. Tahir, taking the center of his
army, launched such a fierce attack on the middle part of Ali bin Isa's
army that they had to withdraw. Seeing this, the defeated right and
left flanks of Tahir' s army returned and courageously joined him. A
very fierce clash took place and during the turmoil of battle, an arrow
0

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

385

pierced Ali bin Isa's neck and killed him. As he fell, his army began to
retreat. Tahir's men chopped off Ali bin Isa's head. His victorious
army chased the runaways for two miles and kept killing and
capturing the Baghdad troops. The darkness of night intervened and
saved them from "further death and captivity. Tahir bin Husain came
back to Rayy and sent a victory letter to Mamoon:
To,
Amir al-Muminin
Respectfully, I beg to state that I am writing this letter in such a
situation that Ali bin Isa's head in lying before me, his ring in on my
finger and his army is under my command.
The letter took three days to reach Fadal bin Saha! in Merv. He carried
it to Mamoon and congratulated him on his victory and the officials of
his government saluted him as the Amir al-Muminin. After two days
Ali's head also arrived which was taken around the country and
shown to the people.
When Baghdad received the news of Ali bin Isa' s death~ Ameen gave
an army of 20,000 men to Abdur Rahman bin Jablah Ambari to fight
with Tahir. Ambari was bestowed with the letter of governorship of
Hamadan and Khorasan urging him to go, capture and form his
government. Abdur Rahman bin Jablah arrived at Hamadan and
besieged its fort. When Tahir received the news, he took his army and
marched towards Hamadan. Abdur Rahman Jablah left Hamadan to
fight him. In the very first assault, Tahir defeated and forced them to
flee . Abdur Rahman went back to Hamadan and made preparations
to fight again, they clashed and Abdur Rahman's forces suffered
defeat again and he entered Hamadan and took _refuge their. Tahir
moved forward and encircled the city and the ~iege became
prolonged . During this period, Tahir conquered Qazwin making its
administra_tors flee . The prolongation of the siege caused great
inconvenience to the civilians and Abdur Rahman apprehended a
night attack by the civilians themselves. He begged Tahir to grant him
pardon and safety. Tahir granted it and brought Hamadan under his
control. Tahir's granting Abdur Rahman pardon and safety allowed
Abdur Rahman to live in Hamadan freely. One day Abdur Rahman

386

History of Islam

found an opportunity, collected his men and launched a sudden
attack on Tahir when he was off his guard. Tahir defeated and killed
Abdur Rahman. His companions who survived fled and met
Huraishi's sons, Abdullah and Ahmad who were coming from
Baghdad to help him. Both were overawed at the prospect of fighting
Tahir and they returned and went back to Baghdad without fighting.
Tahir began to conquer city after city. He reached Halwan and made
fortifications and had trenches dug. After these conquests, Mamoon
made a proclamation that the oath for caliphate should be taken in
every city and his name should be mentioned in the Friday sermon. It
was at this point that he appointed Fadal bin Saha) as his Prime
Minister. Under Fadal bin Saha!, Ali bin Hisham was made the
Defense Minister and Nairn bin Khazim Finance Minister and
superintendent of the office of letters and composition. Fadal bin
Saha!' s brother Hasan bin Saha!, was made an officer in the Ministry
of Taxes.

Disturbances in Caliph Ameen's Government
When Baghdad received the news of Abdur Rahman bin Jablah' s
death while fighting with Tahir, there was an uproar in the city. The
Caliph called Asad bin Yazid bin Mizyad and sent him to confront
Tahir. Asad bin Yazid said to him, "Please give my army salaries for a
year in advance in addition to arms and equipment and promise that
you will leave under our control any of the countries we capture. Give
me veteran and brave fighters sorting out the weak ones." Ameen
flew into a rage when he heard these conditions and sent him to jail.
Then he sent for Abdullah bin Humaid bin Qahtabah and asked him
to go and fight with Tahir. He also laid down similar conditions. He
was also punished. Then Ameen called Asad bin Yazid' s uncle
Ahmad bin Mizyad and begged him to excuse him for imprisoning
Asad and asked him to face Tahir. Ahmad bin Mizyad recommended
to him to release Asad and he was freed . Ahmad bin Mizyad then left
Baghdad with 20,000 fighters . Seeing this, Abdullah bin Humaid binQahtabah expressed his willingness to go fight with another 20,000
soldiers. Both set out for Halwan together. They both camped at
Khafeqeen near Halwan with their forces. Tahir learned of their
position and he also arrived there with his army. He spread his spies

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

387

among the Baghdad army in disguise and they spread the rumors that
the treasury in Baghdad had become empty and the soldiers were
going without salary. The soldiers began looting what ever they
could. This created confusion and anarchy. Some of the spies
contradicted the rumor while others confirmed it. The situation
deteriorated and there was dissension and quarrels among the troops
and they returned to Baghdad without fighting. Tahir moved forward
and occupied Halwan. Meanwhile Harsimah bin Ayun came to Tahir
at Hal wan with a huge army and a letter from Mamoon from Rayy.
The letter said:
"You must hand over all the territory you have conquered to
Harsimah and march towards Ahwaz."
Tahir complied and marched to Ahwaz with the army.

Deposition and Appointments of Caliph Ameen
It has been stated above that Caliph Haroon Rasheed had imprisoned
Abdul Malik bin Saleh for his complicity with the Barmuk family.
Immediately after assuming power, Ameen set him free. When the
Baghdad armies began to suffer repeated defeats at the hands of
Tahir, Abdul Malik bin Saleh went to the Caliph's court and said,
"The Syrians and not the Iraqis should be sent to fight with the
Khorasanis for they can fight more valiantly and I stand surety to their
obedience and loyalty." Caliph Ameen gave him the letter of
governorship for Syria and Jazirah and sent him there. He reached
Riqqah and entered into correspondence With the nobles of Syria and
formed a large army of Syrians. Husain bin Ali bin Isa was also with
Abdul Malik heading the part of the army that consisted of
Khorasanis. Abdul Malik fell ill and died during this period. A civil
war broke out between the Syrians and the Khorasanis. The Syrians
proceeded towards their homes. Husain bin Ali bin Isa took the
Khorasani army with him and went to Baghdad. The civilians and the
nobility of Baghdad welcomed him. Ameen called him to his court at
night but Husain refused to go. The next morning having persuaded
his men to depose Ameen, he came to the bridge leading into the city.
There was a confrontation with Ameen's army, which was defeated.
Husain bin Ali attacked the Caliph's palace, arrested Ameen and his

388

History of Islam

mother Zubaidah Khatoon and imprisoned them in Mansoor's palace
and took the oath from the people for Mamoon's caliphate. The next
day they demanded their daily allowances but they did not receive as
much as they required and that began gossip among the people.
Slowly and gradually, the inhabitants of Baghdad began to express
their sorrow at Ameen's deposition and arrest. They united and
clashed with Husain bin Ali bin Isa. Husain bin Ali bin Isa fought a
very fierce battle with them in which Husain bin Ali bin Isa was
defeated and captured. The citizens went to Mansoor's palace and
freed Ameen and Zubaidah Khatoon. They had Ameen sit on the
throne of the Caliphate and took the oath with him again and they
brought Husain in chains before Ameen. Ameen reproached him and
then pardoned him and said to him, "Make amends for your mistake
by going to fight with Tahir and defeat him and gain respect and
fame." He was then invested with a robe of honor and sent off with
great respect. The civilians of Baghdad accompanied him to the bridge
congratulating him. When the crowed thinned, Husain crossed the
bridge and ran away announcing that he was still a rebel. Ameen sent
some cavalry after him. They caught him at a distance of three miles
from Baghdad and after a light skirmish he was killed . His head was
cut off and brought to Ameen. This occurred on 15 Rajab 196 A.H. The
same day Fadal bin Rabi who was Ameen' s Prime Minister,
disappeared mysteriously and no one knew his whereabouts. Ameen
was very worried over Fadal bin Rabi's disappearance and betrayal.

Tahir's Conquests
While Baghdad was witnessing these destructive events, Tahir bin
Husain handed over the conquered territories to Harsimah bin Ayun
in Halwan and proceeded to Ahwaz on the orders of Mamoon. Before
his departure he sent Husain bin Omar Rustami to intercept any
armies coming from Baghdad. Following the return of Abdullah bin
Humaid bin Qahtabah and Ahmad bin Mizyad, Caliph Ameen sent
Muhammad bin Yazid bin Hatim from Baghdad to defend Ahwaz.
Hearing that Muhammad bin Yazid was coming from Baghdad with
an army, Tahir dispatched a few divisions of his army to reinforce
Husain bin Omar Rustami and issued orders for them to join Husain
bin Omar Rustarni as soon as possible. When Muhammad bin Yazid

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

389

reach~d Mokarram, he was informed of the reinforcements sent by
Tahir. He did not think it proper to face them before he first captured
Ahwaz. He arrived at Ahwaz where he faced Tahir. Following a bitter
battle Muhammad bin Yazid was killed. Tahir captured Ahwaz and
sent administrators to Yamama, Bahrain and Oman. Then he went to
Wasit. Its ruler ran away and Tahir easily captured it. Then he sent his
forces to Kufa. The governor, Abbas bin Hadi, quickly announced
Ameen's deposition and took the oath for Mamoon's caliphate and
wrote a letter to Tahir to that effect. The governor of Basra, Mansoor
bin Mahdi also followed suit. Kufa and Basra were the most important
and strategic locations in Iraq. The governors of both these places
were related to the family of the caliph. They preferred Mamoon to
Ameen and recognized the over throw of Ameen and the caliphate of
Mamoon and thereby set an example to be followed by others.
Dawood bin Isa, the governor of Hijaz who was also from the family
of the caliph also took the oath for Mamoon in the Hijaz as has been
mentioned above. Even the governor of Mousil, Muttalib bin Abdullah
bin Malik announced Ameen' s overthrow and recognized Mamoon as
caliph and took the oath. Tahir retained them all in their posts. He
camped at Jarjaraya and sent Harith bin Hisham and Dawood bin
Musa to Qasr bin Hubairah. This event took place in Rajab 196 A.H.
when Baghdad was witnessing the deposition and accession of Ameen
caused by Husain bin Ali bin Isa as mentioned previously.
Assuming power again after being removed Caliph Ameen sent .
Muhammad bin Sulaiman and Muhammad bin Hammad Berberi to
Qasr bin Hubairah and Fadal bin Musa to Kufa. Harith and Dawood
fought with Muhammad Sulaiman and Muhammad bin Hammad and
after a hard fight forced them to flee back to Baghdad. Tahir then
deputed Muhammad bin Ala to face Fadal bin Musa. When they met
each other on the way, Fadal said to Muhammad bin Ala, "You have
unjustly come to fight with me. I have come as an obedient man to
Mamoon." At night Fadal attacked Muhammad's troops. However,
Muhammad bin Ala anticipated a possible night attack, and was on
his guard. He gave Fadal a tough fight, defeated and forced him to
flee to Baghdad. Then Tahir turned his attention to Madain where
Caliph Ameen' s biggest army was deployed and reinforcements and.
supplies from Baghdad continued to reach t_here uninterruptedly. As

390

History of Islam

soon as Tahir had arrived there, Ameen's entire army fled to Baghdad.
He captured Madain and camped at the Sarsar River and had a bridge
constructed there. When Caliph Ameen sent his armies to Qasr bin
Hubairah and Kufa, he had also sent Ali bin Muhammad bin Isa bin
Naheek to fight Harsimah bin Ayun. The battle took place at Nahrwan.
Harsimah defeated Ali bin Muhammad's army and put them to flight,
captured Ali bin Muhammad and sent him to Mamoon at Merv. He
himself came to Nahrwan instead of Hal wan and camped there.

The Death of Ameen
Every army deployed by Ameen was defeated by Mamoon' s
commanders and his two powerful generals Tahir bin Husain and
Harsimah bin Ayun continued to march towards Baghdad from two
different directions. After the provinces of Mousil, Wasit, Kufa, Basra,
Hijaz and Yamama, went out of Ameen's control his caliphate was
confined to Baghdad and its outskirts. Following the continual failures
of his armies, a very critical and dangerous period started for Ameen
from Ramadan 196 A.H. Being compelled Ameen sent secret messages
to the soldiers in Tahir' s army and conspired to win them over in
exchange for gifts. By this method, 5,000 soldiers from Tahir's army
stationed at the Sarsar River went over to Ameen in Baghctad. Then
some military commanders also joined Ameen . He honored them and
bestowed on them gifts and rewards in accordance with their
qualifications and status. He was able to form a huge army and sent it
to face Tahir. The battle raged from the morning to the evening
resulting ultimately in the defeat and collapse of Ameen's army. The
runaways arrived in Baghdad and Ameen formed a new and fresh
army that did not include any of the defeated soldiers and sent it
again to Sarsar. It also met the same fate . Now Tahir and Harsimah
left Sarsar and Nahrwan respectively and set out for Baghdad. Tahir
camped at Ambar and Harsimah made fortifications at the river.
Abdullah bin Waddah camped at Shamasiyah and Musayyab bin
Zuhair at the palace of Kalwaze. In this way, Mamoon' s generals
encircled Baghdad and put the civilian population to great difficulty.
Meanwhile, Ameen sold his gold and silver ornaments, utensils and
precious goods and disbursed salaries to his army and spent all he
had on defense. The siege continued for about one year and three

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

391

months. Whatever difficulties and inconveniences the people of
Baghdad and Ameen' s generals had to undergo and the bravery with
which they fought are undoubtedly worthy of praise but all those acts
were fruitless and unwise. Sayeed bin Qadim received security and
pardon and joined Tahir who entrusted him with the task of digging
moats and finishing the fortifications. The besiegers included
Harsimah and Tahir, two great generals, but Tahir by virtue of his
conquests and fighting ability was more popular and he was regarded
as the Commander-in-chief of the entire army. Ameen had deputed a
few chiefs at Qasr Saleh and Qasr Sulaiman situated outside of
Baghdad and next to the Tigris River. They were engaged in
launching fireballs and stones with the help of catapults in order to
break the dikes and fortifications of the besieging army. Tahir was
replying in kind by shooting stones and fireballs. The besieging army
advanced and quickly dug moats and more fortifications. They
reached the city wall by narrowing the circle of the siege and entered
by the city gate and by pulling down and over running the
battlements. Then they had to fight in every district and at every step
until they surrounded Ameen in Madinat al-Mansoor (the royal
district). There was a ban on the import of grain and other necessities
of life, criminals were released from the jails and the wicked and evil
ran rampant in the city. Influential and brave generals continued to
leave Ameen and join Tahir due to his efforts to bring them to his side.
The nobility of the city kept leaving and many districts were deserted.
Muhammad bin Isa, Yahya bin Ali bin Isa bin Haman and
Muhammad bin Abi Abbas Tai joined Tahir one after another. The
places they were defending also surrendered to Tahir. Ameen stood
like a rock in defense. At last he entrusted all the war operations to
Muhammad bin Isa bin Naheek. The newly recruited Baghdad army
attacked on the side where the army of Abdullah bin Waddah was
camped and defeated him and captured Shamasiyah. Harsimah
rushed to aid him. He was also defeated and taken captive. His men
through trickery were able to release him. When Tahir was informed
of the setbacks, he himself went to that side, led a very fierce attack
and made Ameen's army retreat and had Abdullah bin Waddah
reestablish the front. By degrees, Tahir distributed his army all over
the city and besieged Ameen in the royal district. Ameen stood the

392

History of Islam

hardships of the siege with great perseverance. From among the
officials of his governments only Hatim bin Saqr, Hasan Huraishi and
Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Aghlab Afriqi accompanied him.
Muhammad bin Ibrahim Aghlab said to Ameen,
"Even in this deteriorating situation 7,000 cavaliers are ready to
carry out your every order. You should select the sons of the
nobility and the officials of the government and appoint an
officer to lead them leave through a gate when the enemies are
off their guard and go to Jazirah and Syria and found a new
government. It is possible that after some time the people may
be inclined towards you and a good way to achieve your goals
may emerge."
If Ameen had acted upon this advice, he would not have met the fate

he encountered. When Tahir came to know of Ameen's intention he
wrote to Sulaiman bin Mansoor and Muhammad bin Isa bin Naheek
that if they did not stop him from doing so, it would not be good for
them. Afraid of Tahir both went to Ameen and said, "It is not proper
for the Amir al-Muminin to surrender to lbn Aqhlab and lbn Saqr.
They are untrustworthy and unreliable. It is better to receive pardon
and safety from Harsimah bin Ayun." When Ibn Saqr came to know
that Caliph Ameen was ready to seek pardon and safety from
Harsimah bin Ayun and hand himself over to him, he said, "O Amir
al-Muminin! If you want pardon and safety you must ask Tahir for it."
Don't go under Harsimah's security. But Ameen said, "I will not seek
pardon and safety from Tahir." Therefore, the message was sent to
Harsimah and he gladly agreed. When Tahir was informed, he was
determined to stop it thinking that the credit for the victory would go
to Harsimah. He placed Ameen's palace under strict surveillance to
thwart his attempt to escape. Harsimah had proposed to Ameen that
at night he should leave his palace, step into his boat just under the
palace and come under his protection. When Harismah saw
preparations on Tahir's side to stop him, he sent a message to Ameen
requesting him to postpone that night because he had seen some
activities on the riverside that indicated danger. Ameen sent back the
reply, "All my supporters and sympathizers have parted with me. I
cannot stay here even for a moment. I feel apprehension that if Tahir

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

393

finds out, he will capture and kill me." Eventually on 25 Muharram
198 A.H. at night, Ameen hugged his two children, kissed them,
departed and came to the riverside weeping and sat in the boat.
Harsimah who was present in the boat received him respectfully,
kissed his hands and ordered the crew to move. As they started,
Tahir's war boats surrounded them and began to attack their boat.
Tahir's divers made holes in the boat and his men showered arrows
from all four sides until it was flooded and sank. The crew caught
Harsimah by his hair and saved him. Ameen began to swim and
Tahir's men caught him. Ahmad bin Salim swam to the bank when he
came out of the water, he was also arrested by Tahir's men. Ahmad
bin Salim says I was arrested and presented before Tahir who threw
me into captivity . A short time later Tahir's soldiers opened the door
of the prison pushed Ameen in closed the door and then left. He was
in his pajamas with a turban on his head and an old cloth over his
shoulders. I read .:,_,,..,,.1J ..,l! L;! J ..ll L;! (To Allah do we belong and to Him
is our return) and began to cry. He recognized me and asked me to
hug him. I was over wrought and nervous. I hugged him. When he
came to his senses after some time, he asked me about Mamoon. I told
him that he was alive and safe. Ameen said, "His advocate told me
that Mamoon was dead . He probably thought that I might become
indifferent to him." I said to him, "May Allah's curse be on your
ministers who betrayed you." Then he gave vent to a cold sigh and
said, "Why brother! Will these people not honor their word of pardon
and safety? I said, "lnshallah they will keep it." As we were talking,
Muhammad bin Humaid came, stood at a distance watching,
recognized Ameen and went back. At midnight, a few non-Arabs
entered the prison with naked swords in their hands. Ameen began to
move backward slowly to see them. One of them rushed forward,
caught hold of him, threw him on the ground, slaughtered him,
chopped off his head and returned with it. When morning came, they
took away his dead body.
Tahir had Ameen's head publicly displayed . When the people had
seen it fully, he sent it with the Caliph's ring, staff and coverlet to
Mamoon through his cousin Muhammad bin Hasan bin Zuraiq bin
Mus'ab and made a proclamation in the city to this effect. On Friday,
he read the sermon in the name of Mamoon at the central mosque and

394

History of Islam

condemned Ameen. He sent Ameen's sons, Musa and Abdullah to
Mamoon. He then sent Ameen's mother Zubaidah Khatoon to a place
near the river Zab. Tahir's army demanded their allowances. When
they were not met, they rebelled . Tahir had to leave Baghdad to save
his life. Then he called all his leaders, formed a group, entered
Baghdad and forced the soldiers and the inhabitants of the city to
obey him.

A Review of Ameen's Caliphate
Caliph Ameen was 27 or 28 years old. He had been caliph for 4 years
and 7 months. His entire reign was plagued with riots and carnage.
Thousands of Muslims were killed for only political reasons. His
regime was one of troubles, evils and misfortunes for the world of
Islam. Ameen was well versed in syntax and literature and composed
verse proficiently, he honored the scholars but he was inclined to
sports and amusement. In matters of administration and expeditions,
he was a misfit. Immediately after becoming Caliph, he ordered a polo
field to be built near the palace of Mansoor. He paid special attention
to decoration and beautification projects. He was fond of singing and
playing musical instruments and worshipping beauty. His greatest
trouble was the body of selfish ministers none of whom ever reminded
him that he was a soldier and he should not dally with women.
In brief, Ameen was overwhelmed with his own youthful passions
and totally devoid of the ability to conquer and rule. Fadal bin Rabi,
his Prime Minister, did not prove to be a good minister for the
dynasty of the Abbasids. It was he who was instrumental in having
the army and the equipment which should have remained under
Mamoon's control in keeping with Haroon's will, brought from Tus to
Baghdad. He tried to harm Mamoon and sowed seeds of contention
betweeh the two brothers. Mamoon would have probably tolerated
this as a small matter and Ameen would not have turned against
Mamoon just for the sake of his extravagance. However, the next
destructive act that Fadal bin Rabi had Ameen accomplish was
beyond the limit of reconciliation. The removal of Mamoon from the
succession and the installation of his own infant son as the next Caliph
destroyed Haroon's well-documented plans for his sons. In order to

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

395

establish the succession of his son, Ameen had to capture the territory
that belonged to Mamoon in accordance with Haroon's will and
distribution. He had the official document of Caliph Haroon Rasheed
removed from the Ka'bah and destroyed at the instance of Fadal bin
Rabi. Consequently, all the influential members of the Abbasid
dynasty were offended and disgusted with him at the inferred
disrespect to his father and even the holy sites.
If we ponder a little we can easily infer that the man who is
responsible for all this damage done to Islam is Haroon Rasheed. The
biggest blunder and the most condemnable act of Haroon Rasheed
was that he was dishonest in naming his successors. He knew that
Mamoon was more capable and deserving yet he chose Ameen to take
the caliphate. A plea may be offered from Haroon's side that Ameen
was noble born from both sides and a pure Hashimiite and
Mammon's mother was Iranian and he had apprehensions that
Mamoon would weaken the Arab elements and promote and
strengthen Iranian authority and power.

Haroon chose Ameen as his successor because he was a pure Arab
and Hashimiite and he believed Ameen would successfully continue
his policy of breaking the Iranians power that he had adopted at the
end of his caliphate. Ameen's heart and mind were not suited for this
purpose. Haroon was aware of this in the last year of his life and he
had become fully convinced of Mamoon's ability to rule and Ameen's
inability. If we go deeper, we will find that Haroon Rasheed was not
at fault but the fundamental policy adopted and followed by the
Abbasids from the very beginning of their dynasty was bound to yield
these results. First, the Abbasids opposed the Arabs by using the
Khorasanis. They put all their energy into effacing and destroying
Arab power and influence and made the newly converted Khorasanis
the leaders. Mention has been made above about the order given by
the leaders of the Abbasids to Abu Muslim not to spare even a single
Arabic speaking soul and Abu Muslim put to death 600,000 Arabs in
Khorasan and Iran. The joint efforts of the Alawiites and the Abbasids
aimed against Banu Umayyah weakened the Arab's influence and
power and strengthened the Khorasanis, Persians and Iraqis. Every
conspiracy against Banu Umayyah that proved fruitful was supported

396

History of Islam

and implemented by the Iraqis and the Khorasanis. When the Banu
Umayyah were destroyed, the Alawiites stood as mute spectators
while the Abbasids became the masters of the caliphate and authority.
When the Alawiites began to oppose the Abbasids and initiated a
series of conspiracies against them, the Abbasids received aid from the
Iraqis and Khorasanis.
Those who were goaded to kill the Arabs against Banu Umayyah
became the greatest threat to the Abbasids. The Khorasanis power
continued to rise until the regime of Mansoor Abbasi. Only for the
short span of a few years during Mahdi's caliphate the Khorasanis
rise stood still and the Arabs were honored. During Hadi and
Haroon's regimes, the Khorasanis continued to increase their power.
In the last years of his caliphate, Haroon realized that by weakening
the Arabs they had harmed the caliphate considerably. He tried to
correct the situation but death did not allow him to do so. During
Ameen's reign, the center of strength for the Arabs was Ameen and
Mamoon for the Khorasanis. In other words, the clash between the
two races Arabs and Iranians manifested itself through Ameen and
Mamoon. Because Ameen was personally incapable and Mamoon
was more capable, the Arab group lost and the Iranians became the
masters of the Islamic world. The Khorasanis held Mamoon dear in
order to bring under their control the machinery of the government
and hand it over to the Alawiites after Mamoon . Due to the
sequence of events, they did not succeed and the government and
the caliphate remained with the Abbasid dynasty. Later, the
Khorasanis and newly converted Turks gathered enough courage
and power to decimate the power of the Islamic Caliphate and form
their own separate kingdoms. The details of which will follow in the
next chapter. The substance of the matter is that the curse of the son
succeeding his father and inherited rule is the root cause of these
evils, troubles and defects in the Islamic Caliphate and it was this
innovation that has done the greatest harm to the Muslims and kept
the inherent justice of Islamic government from being maintained.
The defects of Ameen's regime were the by products of the curse of
inherited succession.
It is a coincidence that the three Caliphs Ali(~ ), Imam Hasan(~ ) and

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (First Phase)

397

Ameen Rasheed were Hashimiite from both mother and father and
the Caliphate did not obviously suit them. That is, the entire regime of
Ali (-t<,) passed in internal conflicts and civil war among the Muslims
and eventually he was martyred. Imam Hasan (~ ) renounced the
Caliphate and he still was poisoned to death. Similarly, Ameen's
entire period of rule was dominated by internecine fights at the end of
which he too was killed.

Chapter 4

The Caliphate of the Abbasids
(Second Phase)

Mamoon Rasheed
Mamoon Rasheed bin Haroon Rasheed' s given name was Abdullah. His
father gave him the title "Mamoon." His kunya (father of__, generally
followed by the name of the first son) was Abul Abbas (father of Abbas).
He was born on Friday in the middle of Rabi-al-Awwal 170 A.H. The
night Mamoon was born Hadi, his uncle who preceded his father as
Caliph, died. His mother's name was Marajil. She was a Zoroastrian
slave girl and died within forty days of his birth. She was born in
Badighais in Herat. Ali bin Isa, the governor of Khorasan, had presented
her as a gift to Haroon Rasheed. Mamoon did not have the opportunity
of being brought up in the lap of his mother. However, Haroon Rasheed
paid special attention to his upbringing and training. At the age of five,
he was put under the tutelage of Kasai Nahvi and Yazeedi. They taught
him Qur'an and Arabic literature.
At 12 when Mamoon achieved understanding and intellectual ability
by virtue of his divine gifted intelligence, he was made the apprentice
of Jafar Barmuk. In the same year 182 A.H., Haroon nominated him to

400

The History of Islam

be the heir apparent after his half brother Ameen. Besides these
teachers there were many religious scholars and those blessed with
deep knowledge of Islam at Haroon's court and they were requested
to educate him from time to time. Mamoon memorized the entire
Quran and was a great scholar. He was eloquent and clever. He was
slightly older than his brother Ameen. He had studied Islamic Law
and Hadith under the guidance of great scholars of these subjects.
Haroon had both his sons educated and trained with great interest
and attention however, the impact this produced in Mamoon was not
shared by Ameen.
Although Mamoon Rasheed had been the ruler of the eastern
countries including Khorasan since Jumad-al-Thani 193 A.H. when
Haroon died, the period of his caliphate begins from Muharram 198
A.H. when Ameen was killed. Ameen was killed on the night of 25
Muharram and the oath for Mamoon's caliphate was taken on Friday
26 Muharram 198 A.H.
When Mamoon was informed about Ameen's murder and the capture
of Baghdad by his army and his recognition as caliph by the people of
Baghdad, he gave the governorship of Jabal Faras, Ahwaz, Basra,
Kufa, Hijaz, and Yemen, to Hasan bin Saha!, the brother of his
minister Fadal bin Saha! and sent him to Baghdad. Harsimah bin
Ayun and Tahir bin Husain had conquered these territories and it was
by virtue of their courage that the people of Baghdad recognized
M,amoon as caliph and Ameen was defeated.
Tahir who did the most to achieve the victory expected that he would
be given the governorship of the newly conquered territories.
Contrary to his expectations it was given to Hasan bin Saha!. Hasan
bin Saha! then made Tahir bin Husain the governor of Jazirah, Mousil
and Syria and sent him to fight with Nasr bin Sheeth bin Agee] bin
Kab bin Rabia bin Amir who had taken the oath of allegiance to
Ameen and had collected a huge army to fight against Mamoon' s
forces and he continued to conquer territory in Iraq. When Hasan bin
Sahal was appointed governor and next to the caliph, the civilians
were sure that he would completely dominate Mamoon and the
Iranians would be the dominant force in the government. The Arab
leaders were worried about these developments and they felt

The Caliphate of the'Abbasids (Second Phase)

401

discouraged and disappointed. They were convinced that Mamoon
would retain Merv as his capital in deference to Fadal bin Sahal's
wishes and would not come to Baghdad.
When Hasan bin Saha! sent Tahir to face Nasr bin Sheeth bin Aqeel,
he only had limited success. He stayed at Riqqah and continued to
engage in light skirmishes with Nasr bin Sheeth. While in Riqqah,
Tahir received the news of his father Husain bin Zuraiq bin Mus'ab's
death in Khorasan and Caliph Mamoon's participation in it. Hasan bin
Saha! ordered Harsimah bin Ayun to go to Khorasan. Nasr bin Sheeth
bin Aqeel rebelled simply because the non-Arabs were given priority
over the Arabs. Tahir did not concentrate on defeating Nasr, as he
himself disliked the domination of the Arabs by the non-Arabs.
Harsimah bin Ayun, who was one of the old devotees of the Abbasid
dynasty, looked at the rise of the non-Arabs with apprehension.

The Revolt of lbn Tabataba and Abu Saraya
Abu Saraya bin Mansoor was related to the tribe of Banu Shaiban.
During Ameen's Caliphate, he was in the army of the governor of
Jazirah. There he murdered a man belonging to Banu Tamim. When
the governor of Jazirah ordered his arrest for the crime, he escaped
and with 30 persons who joined him began plundering whatever and
wherever they could.
After a short time, he along with his group went to Yazid bin Mizyad
in Armenia. Yazid bin Mizyad appointed him to the rank of general.
When Yazid bin Mizyad died, he began to live with his son Asad bin
Yazid. When Asad was deposed from the governorship of Armenia,
Abu Saraya went to Ahmad bin Mizyad. When Ameen deputed
Ahmad bin Mizyad to fight with Harsimah, Ahmad bin Mizyad made
him chief of the vanguard of the army. Harsimah entered into a
conspiracy with him and he went over to Harsimah's side.
He then called the men of his tribe Banu Shaiban to him 2000 of them
responded and joined Harsimah's army. Abu Saraya made a
recommendation on their behalf and handsome allowances were fixed
for them. When Ameen was killed, Harsimah refused to pay the daily
allowance to Banu Shaiban. Abu Saraya became angry with him and
sought his permission to go for Hajj. Harsimah gave him the

402

The History of Islam

perm1ss1on plus a sum of 20,000 dirhams for the expenses of his
journey. He divided the amount among his men and told them to
come to him in one and twos to avoid suspicion. Abu Saraya took
leave of Harsimah and left ostensibly for the purpose of Hajj. He
halted on the way and 200 men rallied round him there. He arrayed
them and invaded Ainuttamar and arrested the rulers there.
Ainuttamar was looted and the spoils ;-Vere distributed among his
men. He continued plundering and looted government treasuries in
several places.
Harsimah sent an army to punish and arrest him. Abu Saraya
·defeated them and forced them to escape. More men joined Abu
Saraya and his power increased. Then he defeated the ruler of
Waquqa and looted the treasury. He went to Ambar, killed its ruler
Ibrahim Sharwi, looted the town, and distributed the spoils among his
men. He went to Riqqah where he came across Mohammad bin
Ibrahim bin Ismail bin Ibrahim bin Hasan bin Muthanna bin Ali who
declared his Caliphate and left Riqqah with Abu Saraya. Mohammad
bin Ibrahim's father was known as Ibrahim Tabataba and he was
known as lbn Tabataba.

It was at this time that Hasan bin Saha! arrived in the Baghdad after
being appointed the governor there and in Yemen and Hijaz. The
Arabs in general looked upon the increase of non-Arab power with
hatred and apprehension and regarded Mamoon's caliphate as harmful
to them and the Alawiites became busy taking advantage of it.
Nasr bin Sheeth announced that he was not an enemy to the Abbasids
but he opposed the present regime simply because it preferred nonArabs to Arabs. The announcement ~ade an impact on the Arab
chiefs of the army and their activities were very lax against Nasr bin
Sheeth.
Hasan bin Saha! at the same time was displeased with Harsimah and
sent him to Khorasan. Abu Saraya took Mohammad bin Ibrahim's (Ibn
Tabataba) presence as a sign of good fortune and took the oath for his
caliphate .. Ibn Tabataba sent Abu Saraya to Kufa by boat along the
river and he himself went to Kufa by land. According to plan Abu
Saraya and Ibn Tabataba entered Kufa on 15 Jamad-al-Thani 199 A.H.
from two different directions and looted the palace of Abbas bin Musa

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

403

bin Isa which was the governor's residence and which also housed the
royal treasury. The entire city was brought under control and all the
civilians took the oath for ibn Tabataba's Caliphate.
When Hasan bin Saha! was informed of the occupation of Kufa by
Abu Saraya and lbn Tabataba, he sent Zuhair bin Musayyib with
10,000 men to Kufa. They came out of Kufa and clashed with Zuhair
and defeated him. Abu Saraya looted Zuhair's military camp, killed
and plundered the people mercilessly. lbn Tabataba forbade him to
indulge in merciless killing and plundering. Abu Saraya who had
become accustomed to such killing and plundering could not tolerate
the interference and he had Ibn Tabataba poisoned. The next day he
was found dead and the period of his authority and conquest ended.
Abu Sara ya had a young boy Mohammad bin Jafar bin Mohammad
bin Zaid bin Ali bin Husain bin Ali bin Abi Talib, lbn Tabataba's
deputy and took the oath for him and began to run and manage all
state affairs using him as a figure head.

Abu Saraya's Government and its End
After being defeated, Zuhair bin Musayyib went to Qasr bin Hubairah
and stayed there. Hasan bin Saha) gave Abdus bin Mohammad bin
Khalid Marwarozi 4,000 men and sent him to reinforce Zuhair. Zuhair
and Abdus attacked Kufa but were defeated and killed on 15 Rajab
199 A.H. while fighting against Abu Saraya. Following the victory
Abu Saraya issued coins in his name in Kufa, appointed several
Alawiites as governors of several provinces. He sent Abbas bin
Mohammad bin Isa bin Mohammad to Ahwaz, Husain bin Hasan bin
Ali ·bin Husain bin Ali bin Abi Talib known as Aftas to Makkah,
Ibrahim bin Musa bin Jafar Sadiq to Yemen and Zaid bin Musa bin
Jafar Sadiq to Basra. Abbas captured Basra after defeating its ruler. All
the governors of Abu Sara ya scored victories. Abu Saraya wrote to
Abbas bin Mohammad to take an army from Ahwaz and invade
Baghdad from the eastern side while he stayed at Qasr ibn Hubairah.
Hasan bin Saha! sent Ali bin Sayeed from Baghdad to Madain in
defense of Madain and Wasit. When Abu Saraya found this out, he at
once sent an army from Qasr ibn Hubairah, which occupied Madain
in Ramadan 199 A.H. before the arrival of Ali bin Sayeed. Abu Saraya

404

The History of Islam

himself left Qasr Ibn Hubairah and camped at the Sarsar River. Ali ibn
Sayeed reached Maclain and besieged Abu Saraya's army in Shawwal
199 A.H. Receiving the news that his army had been encircled, Abu
Saraya left the Sarsar River and marched towards Qasr ibn Hubairah.
When the armies sent by Hasan bin Saha! suffered defeat at the hands
of Abu Saraya and his leaders were killed and captured in Rajab 199
A.H ., Hasan bin Sahal was very worried. At that time Tahir was in
Riqqah and could not leave due to Nasr bin Sheeth. Harsimah had left
Baghdad and gone to Khorasan. Except these two commanders,
Hasan bin Saha! had no other commander at his disposal to be sent
against Abu Sara ya. Abu Saraya had begun making preparations to
conquer Baghdad. He !1ad already captured Basra, Kufa, Wasit, and
Maclain, Hasan bin Saha! and Harsimah were at odds with each other.
Hasan did not want to seek help from Harsimah but in view of the
critical situation, he sent a fast messenger to Harsimah asking him to
return and tackle the affair of Abu Sara ya. Harsimah did not want to
make Hasan bin Sahal's affairs easier. However, since Hasan bin Saha!
had personally requested help, he did not think it proper to refuse and
immediately returned to Baghdad. He entered the city at the time Abu
Sara ya had already left the Sarsar River for Qasr Ibn Hubairah after
hearing about the siege of Maclain. Harsimah left Baghdad in pursuit
of Abu Saraya without any hesitation. He came across a group of Abu
Saraya's supporters and he surrounded and killed them. He moved
quickly and caught up with Abu Saraya. Abu Sara ya attacked. The
battle resulted in the death of many of his men but Abu Saraya
escaped. He went to Kufa and looted the houses of Banu Abbas and
their supporters and reduced-them to rubble capturing all their goods,
belongings and valuables. Harsimah moved forward, and besieged
Kufa. Abu Saraya showed great perseverance in defense in a two
month long siege of Kufa. Being compelled by the siege, he took
Mohammad bin ]afar bin Mohammad and 800 horsemen and escaped
from Kufa. Harsimah entered Kufa on 15 Muharram 200 A.H.
appointed an administrator there and returned to Baghdad.
Abu Saraya left Kufa for Qadsiyah. Then he went towards Tus. He
came across a caravan, which was going from Ahwaz loaded with
merchandise. He looted it and distributed the loot among his men.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

405

During the same period, Hasan bin Ali Mamooni expelled Abu
Saraya's governor from Ahwaz and occupied it. When Hasan bin Ali
heard about Abu Saraya' s condition, he took an army from Ahwaz
and went in pursuit of Abu Saraya. When they clashed, Abu Saraya
suffered a crushing defeat. After being defeated, he went to Rasain in
Jalula . Hasan bin Ali quickly surrounded and captured him along
with Mohammad )afar bin Mohammad and sent them to Hasan bin
Sahal. He had Abu Saraya slaughtered and hung his corpse on the
bridge of Baghdad. He sent his head and the head of Mohammad bin
Jafar bin Mohammad to Mamoon. Ali bin Sayeed conquered Maclain,
slaughtered Abu Saraya's men and went to Wasit and captured it in
accordance with Hasan bin Sahal's order and then left Wasit for Basra.
He dethroned Zaid bin Musa bin Jafar Sadiq there and captured
Basra. Zaid bin Musa set fire to all the houses of Banu Abbas and their
supporters. He came to be known as Zaid an-Nar (Zaid the fire). Ali
bin Sayeed arrested Zaid an-Nar and put him in confinement. In
Muharram 200 A.H., the corruption of Abu Saraya in Iraq came to an
end but Hijaz and Yemen were still reeling under the disturbances
and unrest that he had started.

Unrest in Hijaz and Yemen
As mentioned above, Abu Saraya had appointed many members of
the family of Abi Talib as governors and heads of provinces and
states. The Alawiites were engaged in a conspiracy against the Abbasid
caliphate. It was a display of wisdom on the part of Abu Saraya_to
appoint Alawiite rulers to provinces and states thereby turning his
government into a government of the Alawiites. Although Abu Sara ya
was dead, most of the Alawiites who were in power in the provinces
did not surrender and kept struggling to establish their caliphate.
They had an opportunity to establish themselves after Ameen's death
because Sahal' s sons Fadal and Hasan, who had Mamoon under their
control were Iranian by race and considered the family of Abi Talib
superior to the family of Abbas so they favored the Alawiites.
Mamoon was educated and trained by Jafar Barmuk and had respect
and love in his heart for members of the Prophet's family. His Prime
Minister had the opportunity to turn the government towards the

406

The History of Islam

Alawiites after the death of Ameen. However, Harismah' s military
acumen put an end to Abu Saraya and cleared Iraq of the Alawiites'
style of governing and caused their failure in the Hijaz and Yemen.
When Abu Saraya appointed Husain Aftas governor of Makkah,
Haroon Rasheed's servant, Masroor with 100 men, was in Makkah. At
that time the governor of Makkah appointed by Mamoon was
Dawood bin Isa bin Musa Abbasi. Masroor and Dawood heard the
news of the arrival of Husain Aftas in Makkah and they convened a
meeting of the Abbasids and their supporters to decide what to do.
Masroor and others felt that they should fight. However, Dawood
said, "I do not like bloodshed at the Haram Shareef. If Husain Aftas
enters Makkah by one side, I shall make an exit by the other."
Masroor remained silent and Dawood left for Iraq upon the arrival of
Husain Aftas. Masroor also left Makkah. Husain Aftas halted outside
Makkah and entered when he heard that the Abbasid governor left
Makkah, he entered with only ten men. He made Tawaf, circling the
Ka'bah, stayed there for one night and then called for his men to join
him and occupied Makkah and began to rule over it.
Having reached Yemen, Ibrahim bin Musa bin Jafar Sadiq expelled
Mamoon's governor Ishaq bin Musa bin Isa and began to govern it.
Husain Aftas removed the cover of the Ka'bah and put the new one
sent by Abu Saraya on, he looted the houses of Banu Abbas, took their
valuables by force and then started taking the possessions of the
general public in Makkah. He removed the gold from the pillars
around the Ka'bah and emptied the treasury and distributed it among
his men.
Ibrahim bin Musa arrived in Yemen and started slaughtering and
plundering he was called Qassab for massacring people in large
numbers. He is still referred to by this name. Other chiefs of the
Alawiites who ruled on behalf of Ibrahim bin Musa and Husain Aftas
were also involved in looting, killing and plundering. You have read
about Zaid bin Musa who was called "Zaid the fire" for perpetrating
atrocities. The Alawiites who received power from Abu Sara ya for a
short period, created disturbances and their tyrannical and merciless
acts proved to be their doom. When the news of Abu Sara ya' s death
reached Makkah, the Makkans began to whisper among themselves.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

407

Husain Aftas called on Mohammad bin Jafar Sadiq bin Muhammad
Baqar bin Ali bin Husain bin Ali bin Abi Talib and said, "This is the
most suitable time. People's hearts are inclined towards you. Abu
Saraya has been killed. You should accept the oath for your caliphate.
I take the oath at your hands and none will oppose you." Mohammad
bin Jafar was ready to take the oath and he began to be addressed as
Amir al-Muminin. After this, Husain Aftas and Mohammad bin
Jafar's son Ali started criminal activities. They began raping women
and became so notorious that it was very difficult for the women of
Makkah to protect their chastity. They began to humiliate men and
women in public. A group of criminals joined them and they
continued their crimes.
One day, Ishaq bin Mohammad, the son of the head judge of Makkah,
was passing through the market and Ali bin Mohammad bin Jafar, the
Amir al-Muminin's son had him arrested and imprisoned him in his
house. The people held a meeting and it was unanimously resolved
that Mohammad bin Jafar Sadiq should be removed and the judge's
son should be released from the control of Ali bin Mohammad bin
Jafar. When they went to the Amir al-Muminin's house and encircled
it, they granted his son pardon and safety if he returned the judge's
son. He then entered his son's house and found the boy there and
handed him over to the people.
It has been mentioned above that Ibrahim bin Musa Kazim known as

Ibrahim Qassab had expelled the governor of Yemen, Ishaq bin Musa
bin Isa. lshaq bin Musa went in hiding in Yemen and bided his time.
Having observed the oppressive government of the Alawiites and the
people's hatred against them, he easily formed an army. Ibrahim came
from Makkah. lshaq left Yemen and decided to invade Makkah. The
Alawiites gathered the Bedouins of the adjoining areas, dug out
trenches and prepared themselves to face lshaq. Ishaq marshaled his
troops in the battle array but changed his mind and he left for Iraq.
Hasan bin Sahal became free from the troubles in Iraq and drew
Harsimah's attention to the necessity of putting down the riots in the
Hijaz and Yemen. Harsimah gave an army to Raja bin Jameel and
Jaludi and sent them to Makkah. While Harsimah's army was on the
way to Makkah, Ishaq was coming from there and they met on the

408

The History of Islam

way. Ishag and his army returned to Makkah with them. They found
the Alawiites there guite ready to accept the challenge. After a fierce
battle, the Alawiites were defeated and the Abbasid army entered
Makkah as victors.
Mohammad bin Jafar asked for pardon and security and it was
granted. He went to Juhfa and from there he proceeded to Juhaina
where he started gathering an army. When he formed a large army, he
invaded Madinah. The governor of Madinah Haroon bin Musayyib
fought several battles with them and finally Mohammad bin Jafar
Sadiq suffered a crushing defeat and returned to Juhaina. During the
battle, he lost an eye and many of his men were killed . The next year
during the season of Hajj, he asked the rulers of Makkah Raja bin
Jameel and Jaludi for pardon and security and came to Makkah. He
gathered the people and delivered a sermon. He said "I thought that
Mamoon Rasheed was dead and therefore I took the oath from the
people. Now the correct information has come to me that he is still
living. Therefore I release you from the oath". Then after performing
Hajj, he went to Hasan bin Saha] in 201 A.H. who sent him to Caliph
Mamoon. Mamoon treated him with honor. He decided to go to Merv
from Irag and died at Jurjan on the way.

The Death of Harsimah bin Ayun
Fadal bin Saha! had assisted Mamoon very much after Haroon
Rasheed's death and provided him with all the materials for the fight
against his brother Ameen. Mamoon made him the Prime Minister and
the director of the military expeditions and the office of official
documents. The Iranians favored Mamoon who had been trained by
Jafar Barmuk. He had reduced their taxes of the Iranians by one
quarter. Fadal had all the facilities available to dominate over his
ministry and was able to dictate to the Caliph. He had persuaded
Mamoon to keep Merv as the capital. The Arabs were not able to
establish their power in Merv. Had Mamoon Rasheed gone to Baghdad,
Fadal bin Saha! would not have enjoyed as much power and the Arabs
would not have allowed the Caliph to follow Sahal bin Fadal's
dictates. Hasan bin Fadal was appointed as the ruler of Irag and Hijaz
in order to weaken the Arabs. Harsimah and Tahir were two formidable

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

409

and powerful generals who performed great feats in the battles that
established Mamoon's caliphate. Tahir was more popular than
Harsimah but Harsimah's age and length of service raised him in rank
and they both enjoyed equal honor at the Caliph' s court.
Tahir felt that his killing Ameen hurt Mamoon and this damaged his
chance for advancement. Tahir was not given the governorship of the
territories he conquered. Saha! bin Fadal was able to appoint his
brother, Hasan bin Saha! as the ruler of the Western territories by the
order of Mamoon. Tahir was powerless to make any move to break
the power of the non-Arabs and bring Mamoon and the government
from Merv to Baghdad. Orily Harsimah could have done something to
draw the Caliph's attention to it in deference to the wishes of the Arabs.
Harsimah knew that no letter or application could reach the Caliph
direct without passing through Fadal bin Sahal's hands. He also knew
that no one could see him without the permission of Fadal. Mamoon
Rasheed's condition was like that of a prisoner in his own court.
This was the first example in the history of Islam that a minister had
virtually put the Caliph under house arrest and the latter did not
realize it. Following Abu Saraya's death and the departure of the
army to Makkah Harsimah found out that the caliph was completely
in the dark about the rebellions in Iraq and the Hijaz and the general
condition of the country. He immediately departed for Khorasan with
the intention of going personally to the Caliph's court and apprising
him of all the details of Fadal bin Sahal's activities, which he had
concealed from him. Without taking permission from Hasan bin Saha!,
Harsimah left for Khorasan. When Fadal bin Saha! was informed that
Harsimah was on the way to the Caliph's court, he had an order sent
by Mamoon that he should go to Syria and the Hijaz where he was
needed and that it was not necessary for hi~ to come to Khoras~n.
Harsimah already realized the reality of Mamoon's court and
therefore did not pay attention to Mamoon's order and depending on
his service record and special rights continued to Merv . When he
approached Merv, he ordered the drums to be beaten as soon as he
entered the city so that the Caliph would know that some commander
was entering the city and to stop Fadal bin Saha! from preventing him
to go before the Caliph. When Fadal came to know that Harsimah did

410

The History of Islam

not comply with the Caliph's order and continued marching to Merv
and had the intention of lodging a complaint against him, he said to
Mamoon Rasheed, "I have come to know through a reliable source
that Harsimah incited Abu Saraya to rebel against you and when
Harsimah was deputed to punish him, he let him escape, and it was
Hasan bin Ali who killed him. Only Allah knows his intention but his
boldness and impertinence have exceeded all limits, when you
ordered him to go to Syria he disobeyed it and is coming to Merv as if
he is the ruler."
When Harsimah entered the city with the accompanying uproar of
beating drums, Mamoon said, "What is causing this noise?" Fadal
said, "Harsimah has arrived and he is entering the city in an insolent
manner." Mamoon flew into a rage on hearing this. Finally, Harsimah
entered the court but before he could explain the purpose of his visit,
Mamoon said, "Why did not you comply with my order?" Harsimah
began to offer excuses but Mamoon was so angry that he expelled him
from the court dishonorably and sent him to jail. His past performance
and achievement could have helped him and Mamoon might have
relented and turned to him after cooling down but Fadal bin Saha! did
not let this opportunity slip through his fingers . He had him killed
and informed Mamoon that he died of natural causes in the jail.
Mamoon was not sorry to hear of his death and the condition of
Mamoon' s court that Harsimah tried to change continued as usual. He
died a sad death and there was nobody to undertake the job of
informing the Caliph of the truth.

Commotion in Baghdad
When Harsimah was killed in the jail, Hasan bin Saha! was away from
Baghdad in Nahrwan. When the news of Harsimah's death reached
Baghdad, there was a great outcry and everyb<?dy felt that Fadal bin
Sahal had captured the Caliph and because Fadal was a Zoroastrian
and the son of a Zoroastrian the Arabs would be humiliated .
Mohammad bin Abi Khalid promised the people of Baghdad that he
would expel Hasan bin Sahal from Iraq and the inhabitants of
Baghdad supported him. Mohammad bin Abi Khalid reorganized the
army and expelled Ali bin Hisham, the governor appointed by Hasan

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

411

bin Saha!, from Baghdad. Hasan bin Saha! sent forces from Nahrwan
to Baghdad. Mohammad bin Abi Khalid defeated them and made
them flee. Hasan bin Saha! went to Wasit and Mohammad bin Abi
Khalid left Baghdad with his army and marched towards Wasit.
Hasan bin Saha! left Wasit when he learned of Mohammad bin Abi
Khalid's approach. He entered Wasit and occupied it and then
immediately set out in pursuit of Hasan bin Saha!. Mohammad bin
Abi Khalid camped at Jarjaraya and after preparing himself clashed
with Hasan bin Saha!. Several battles were fought. In one of the
battles, he was mortally wounded. His son brought him to Baghdad
but he succumbed to the injuries. The natives of Baghdad wanted to
make Mansoor bin Mehdi bin Mansoor Abbasi caliph but he dedined.
Finally, after much persuasion he agreed that Mamoon would remain
caliph and his name would continue to be read in the sermon and he
would be the Caliph's deputy in place of Hasan bin Saha!. Therefore,
in the month of Rabia al-Awwal 201 A.H., Mansoor bin Mehdi took
over Baghdad and Isa bin Mohammad bin Abi Khalid was appointed
commander-in-chief.
Hasan bin Saha! steadied himself and then sent forces against
Mansoor bin Mehdi and a chain of battles started. In Iraq there was an
uproar and in Merv Mamoon Rasheed remained in the dark because
Fadal bin Saha! had cut off all means of communicating information to
him. During the battles between Mansoor bin Mehdi and Hasan bin
Sahal, criminals had a chance to commit crimes with impunity.
Looting, robbery, theft, rape and oppression were committed openly
on a large scale. No one hesitated in committing a crime, when the
corruption reached its zenith the noblemen of Baghdad who had
grown sick of the lawless deeds in Baghdad nominated Khalid
Madryush and Saha! bin Salamah_to begin the work of calling to the
good and forbidding evil by sermonizing the masses. Their joint
efforts yielded results and the corruption was reduced considerably.
However, Mansoor bin Mehdi and Isa bin Mohammad bin Abi Khalid
apprehended rebellion from Saha! bin Salamah. At last Mansoor and
Isa reconciled with Hasan bin Saha! on tl;le condition that Hasan bin
Saha! should have a pardon for them signed by caliph Mamoon and
keep these two men as the rulers of Baghdad.

412

The History of Islam

Hasan bin Sahal entered Baghdad, assigned them as rulers of
Baghdad on his behalf and went back to Nahrwan. This took place in
Ramadan in 201 A.H. While these incidents were taking place, in
Merv in Ramadan, 201 A.H. Mamoon Rasheed was nominating Ali
Rada bin Musa Kazim bin Jafar Sadiq his heir-apparent and was
totally unaware of the events that were taking place in Baghdad.

The Succession of Imam Ali Rada
Mamoon Rasheed was completely unaware of the affairs of state
under Fadal bin Saha! who ran the government as he wanted.
Mamoon didn't even know that he was living the life of a man under
house arrest.
In 200 A.H., Mamoon called most of the members of the Abbasids to
Merv and kept them as his guests for months although none of them
merited selection as heir apparent. Finally, Fadal bin Saha! and other
supporters of the Prophet's family drew his attention to Ali Rada bin
Musa Kazim. The fact was that he was superior to all among the Banu
Hashim in respect of his competence and qualification. Mamoon had
his daughter married to Ali Rada without any hesitation and in
Ramadan 201 A.H. he made Ali Rada bin Musa Kazim his heirapparent and deposed his own brother Motamin who was made heirapparent after Mamoon by Haroon Rasheed. Haroon had himself
authorized Mamoon to remove Mptamin and so Mamoon cannot be
accused of deposing Motamin unlawfully. Following this Mamoon
stopped wearing black clothes, which was the mark of the Abbasids
and began to put on green clothes, which was the mark of the
Alawiites. Then all the territories followed suit.
Mamoon then ·issued instructions to the governors, officials and
soldiers to use green clothes instead of black ones throughout the
entire realm. He sent orders to the governors to take the oath from the
people for the succession of Ali Rada bin Musa Kazim. When that
order was conveyed to the government officials through Fadal bin
Saha!, some obeyed it with pleasure and some detested ft. When
Hasan bin Saha! sent that order to Isa bin Mohammad bin Abi Khalid
and Mansoor bin Mehdi in Baghdad, it created a new uproar and the
people were convinced that Fadal bin Saha! succeeded in taking the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

413

caliphate away from the Abbasids and delivered it to the Alawiites.
The Abbasids and their supporters could not tolerate it. They knew
that Abu Muslim was the first who tried to take the caliphate away
from the Abbasids and deliver it to the Alawiites and about another
abortive attempt that was made by the Barmuk family. As the
distinction between the Arabs and the non-Arabs became apparent, the
general Arab masses considered Fadal bin Sahal to be their opponent
and the patron of the non-Arabs. The Arab's understood Ali Rada's
succession to be a victory for the non-Arabs and a defeat of the Arabs.
The Arabs dominated Baghdad and it was the central city of the
Abbasids. The news created great unrest there and caused them to
consult with one another on the issue. They had the recent experience
of undergoing untold miseries during rebellion and disobedience and
caution made.them to decide that it was essential to learn the reaction
of the other Islamic provinces and territories to the news of Ali Rada's
succession before they considered action. The news reached Baghdad
in Ramadan 201 A.H. and for three months, they did not take any
steps. Meanwhile the movement to stop the caliphate from being
taken away from the Abbasids and given to the Alawiites continued to
gather strength.

Ibrahim bin Mehdi's Caliphate
On 25 Dhul Hijjah 201 A.H., the Abbasids and their supporters chose
Ibrahim bin Mehdi for the caliphate and took the oath for him secretly.
On 1 Muharram 202 A.H., all of Baghdad took the oath openly and
made him caliph and deposed Mamoon. As soon as Ibrahim assumed
power, he promised the soldiers to pay them six months salary as a
reward. He captured Kufa and Sa wad and marched to Maclain and
was occupied in strengthening his army. He then deputed Abbas Bin
Musa ruler of Baghdad and Ishaq bin Musa in the eastern territories.
On Hasan bin Sahal's side, Humaid bin Abdul Humaid was in Qasr
Ibn Hubairah. He went to Hasan bin Saha!. Ibrahim bin Mehdi sen '
Isa bin Mohammad bin Abi Khalid to capture Qasr lbn Hubairah ancl
he captured it looting Humaid's military camp. Hasan bin Sahal gave
a letter of governorship to Ali Rada's brother Abbas bin Musa Kazim
and sent him to Kufa. He reached Kufa and made an announcement

414

The History of Islam

saying, "My brother Ali Rada will succeed to the caliphate after
Mamoon. Those of you who are the lovers of the Prophet's family
should not recognize Ibrahim bin Mehdi as caliph and any action
against Mamoon Rasheed's caliphate is not correct."
The Kufans recognized Abbas bin Musa Kazim' s governorship and
only the Shiites stayed unattached maintaining the position that they
supported his brother Ali Rada but wanted nothing to do with
Mamoon . Ibrahim bin Mehdi deputed his two generals Sayeed and
Abu! Bast to challenge Abbas bin Musa Kazim. Abbas sent his cousin
Ali bin Mohammad bin Jafar to fight with him. The armies clashed,
which resulted in the defeat of Ali bin Mohammad. Sayeed camped at
Hirah and ordered the army to move on to Kufa. The Kufans and
Abbas fought several battles and finally the Kufans and Abbas asked
for safety and security. Abbas bin Musa Kazim came out of the house
and the victorious army began to enter Kufa. In the meantime,
Abbas's men felt enthused and emboldened and prepared to fight
again. Sayeed's army defeated them again, occupied Kufa and
imprisoned Abbas.
Hearing the news Sayeed left Hirah and came to Kufa and after
making an inquiry if Abbas had violated the agreement after asking
for safety and security released him. He had some killed for violation
of the peace and after appointing a governor in Kufa went to Baghdad.
Hasan bin Saha! sent Humaid bin Abdul Humaid to Kufa. The
governor in Kufa fled without a fight. Ibrahim bin Mehdi sent Isa bin
Mohammad bin Abi Khalid to Wasit to attack Hasan bin Saha!. Hasan
bin Sahal defeated and forced Isa bin Mohammad to flee to Baghdad.
ln short, 202 A.H. passed and 203 A.H. began with these upheavals.
Ibrahim left no store unturned in strengthening his caliphate in all
possible ways. In the beginning of 203 A.H., Baghdad saw an
upheaval, which p'..lt his caliphate and government in peril. Humaid
bin Abdul Hl.,naid made up his mind to go to Baghdad and fight with
Ibrahim bin Mehdi after gaining control over Kufa. Ibrahim bin
Mehdi's general was Isa bin Mohammad bin Abi Khalid .
Humaid conspired with Isa bin Mohammad bin Abi Khalid by
sending to him messages surreptitiously therefore, he avoided and
evaded a confrontation with Humaid. When Isa's brother Haroon bin

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

415

Mohammad found out about thr conspiracy, he informed Ibrahim bin
Mehdi. Ibrahim bin Mehdi called Isa to his court, humiliated him and
threw him into prison. When the soldiers heard of his imprisonment,
they became restless and Isa's deputy Abbas entered into a coalition
with them and proposed the overthrow of Ibrahim bin Mehdi. Most of
the inhabitants of Baghdad joined the coup and imprisoned Ibrahim' s
officials and agents. Then Abbas wrote to Humaid, "Come to Baghdad
at once. I shall hand over Baghdad to you". Humaid arrived in
Baghdad with his army and gained control over a part of the city. The
other part was under the control of Ibrahim bin Mehdi. A few battles
were fought in the city. Finally, becoming frustrated Ibrahim bin
Mehdi went into hiding and the whole of the city fell under the
control of Hasan bin Sahal's generals Humaid bin Abdul Humaid and
Ali bin Hisham. Thus, the caliphate of Ibrahim bin Mehdi ended on 17
Dhul Hijjah 203 A.H.

The Death of Fadal bin Sabal
It has been mentioned that whatever news Fadal bin Saha] wanted to
communicate to Mamoon he passed it on and whatever he wished to
conceal from him he withheld it. He therefore withheld from him the
news of Ibrahim bin Mehdi' s assuming power as caliph in Baghdad
and none dared to acquaint Mamoon with the state of affairs in Iraq.
Fadal had deputed Tahir bin Husain as the ruler of Riqqah. Tahir was
a famous general whose services could have been utilized in putting
an end to the unrest in Iraq but Fadal bin Saha! considered him to be
like Harsimah. So, by appointing him governor of an ordinary state he
had virtually paralyzed him.
In Iraq unrest continued to increase unabated and the masses began to
hate Hasan bin Saha! even more. A few persons therefore gathered
courage and ran the risk of undertaking the journey to Merv and
called on Ali Rada bin Musa Kazim, the heir apparent to the caliphate,
and ·said, "No one else dares to make Mamoon aware of the real state
of affairs except you. So kindly settle this issue."
Although Ali Rada did not regard Fadal bin Saha! as his opponent
and always looked at him as a supporter, it was the purity of his heart
and intention that convinced him to do the job. He briefed Mamoon

416

The History of Islam

Rasheed in detail about Fadal bin Sahal' s and Hasan bin Saha I's
improper activities, the murder of Harsimah, neutralizing the power
of Tahir, the riot in Iraq and the caliphate of Ibrahim bin Mehdi and
said, "The masses are getting sick and your caliphate is in danger."
While informing him of all these details he also said to him clearly,
"Because you have made me your heir apparent Banu Abbas and their
supporters are displeased with you."
After hearing about all these matters Mamoon said to him, "Is
anybody else aware of these things_ other than you?" He said, "Your
chiefs and companions also know these things but they are paralyzed
with fear of Fadal bin Sahal and they dare not tell you." Mamoon
called those officers in private and inquired of them. They all declined
to speak · but when he assured them that Fadal would not harm them,
they opened their months and told him everything and confirmed
what Ali Rada had informed him. Hearing this he intended to leave.
Merv and go to Iraq. When Fadal came to know about the disclosures,
he persecuted the leaders who had acquainted Mamoon with the real
state of affairs. He imprisoned some of them and some were insulted
and lashed but it was too late to change anything. Mamoon took the
wise step that he did not let Fadal bin Saha! become afraid or
frustrated. He made Fadal bin Sahal's cousin Ghassan bin Abbad the
governor of Khorasan and left Khorasan and went to Iraq. He arrived
at Sarkhas. There Fadal bin Saha! was attacked and killed by four
persons in his bathroom. The killers escaped.
Mamoon announced that whosoever captured the killers would be
given 10,000 dinars. They were duly arrested and killed by his orders.
Their heads were sent to Hasan bin Saha!.
Mamoon wrote a consolatory letter to Hasan bin Saha! and made him
his minister in Fadal bin Sahal's place. He then visited Fadal's mother
to console her. He said to her, "Just as Fadal was your son, I am your
son also." After a few days, he married Hasan bin Sahal' s daughter
Boran and thereby raised H asan's prestige. In short, Fadal bin Sahal's
murder took place in the same way in which )afar Barmuk's murder
had taken place. It goes without saying that it was Ma moon Rasheed
who had him murdered and those four men who killed him in his
bathroom were ordered by Mamoon Rasheed . Fadal had proved

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

417

himself deserving to be killed . In this respect, Mamoon followed his
father Haroon Rasheed with the difference that the Haroon had Jafar
Barmuk killed and then punished the entire Barmuk family and took
the blame of his murder upon himself, while Mamoon had Fadal
killed and bestowed so much favor on his family that no one could
dare condemn or slander him or prove him guilty to such an extent
that even Fadal's brother, father and mother did not complain. The
murd er took place at Sarkhas on 2 Shaban 202 A.H.

The Death of Imam Ali Rada bin Musa Kazim
Caliph Mamoon· Rasheed had already had his daughter Umm Habib
married to Ali Rada . During the journey to Iraq, he married his second
daughter to Ali Rada' s son Mohammad bin Ali Rada but the
departure to her husband's house was deferred until she came·of age
some years later. Mamoon left Merv in Rajab 202 A.H. and reached
Baghdad on 15 Safar 204 A.H. He covered the journey in one year and
six months and came to Baghdad after halting at many places on the
way. The journey fully acquainted him with the situation in the
country and the people favorably responded to him upon his arrival
in Baghdad. During the 15ame journey, he sent Ali Rada's brother
[brahim bin Musa Kazim as the leader of the pilgrimage and gave him
the governorship of Yemen. He halted at Tus and came to his father's
grave and prayed for him.
He stayed in Tus for over a month. What happened while they were
there was that the heir apparent Imam Ali Rada died while eating
grapes. Mamoon was extremely shocked about his death. He
accompanied the funeral procession bare headed and said, "0 Abul
Hasan! Where should I go and what should I do after you?" For three
days, he halted at the grave and lived on bread and salt. He had his
father Haroon Rasheed's grave dug out and put Ali Rada's dead body
into it so that Haroon Rasheed should be benefited from Ali Rada's
grace. Mamoon Rasheed was dedicated to Ali Rada. The popular
suspicion that it was Mamoon Rasheed who had his grapes poisoned
seems to be totally baseless since he was not compelled to choose him
as his heir apparent, which he did of his own accord. He married his
daughters to Ali Rada and to his son willingly. He made Ali Rada's

418

The History of Islam

brother governor of Yemen and leader of the pilgrimage. He could not
have served a man so much whom he wanted to have killed.
Furthermore, how could he put the body of a man he had killed into
his father's grave? To have him buried in his father's grave is ample
proof of his true and deep love for him, which was not tainted by
hypocrisy or pretense. His deep mourning over his death also
indicates this fact. Mamoon Rasheed always dealt kindly with the
Alawiites during his caliphate and appointed them to high posts,
which cannot be overlooked. All these sufficiently demonstrate that he
did not hate the Alawiites. He wanted to improve their lot and help
them. Had he removed Ali Rada by poison, he could not have
continued to behave with them in the manner that he did. It is possible
that Banu Abbas or one of their supporters poisoned his grapes
because they were displeased with Mamoon Rasheed for making Ali
Rada his heir-apparent. Imam Ali Rada died in Safar 203 A.H. when
he was 55. He was born at Madinah.

Tahir bin Husain's Reappearance
Tahir bin Husain bin Mus'ab bin Zuraiq bin Hamam has been
mentioned above. His grandfather, Zuraiq was the slave of the famous
Talha bin Obaidullah. Zuraiq's son Mus'ab bin Zuraiq was a clerk to
Banu Abbas's Naqeeb Sulaiman bin Kaseer and was eventually the
Ameer of Herat.
Mus'ab's son Tahir bin Husain was born at Merv in 159 A.H. Fadal
bin Saha! gave him the governorship of Riqqah and sent him to fight
with Nasr bin Sheeth. Nasr bin Sheeth captured Halab and its eastern
territories and set himself up as its ruler. Since Tahir did not get the
expected and suitable reward following Ameen's death and the
victory of Baghdad and since he did not get sufficient encouragement
from Fadal bin Saha!, he lived at Riqqah and fought with Nasr bin
Sheeth but without enthusiasm. Nasr announced that he did not want
to obey Mamoon because he had preferred the non-Arabs to the
Arabs. On this point, Tahir agreed with him. When Mamoon became
aware of the real state of affairs and left for Baghdad, he wrote to
Tahir asking to see him at Nahrwan before reaching Baghdad.
Mamoon left Tus and arrived at Jurjan. He stayed there for over a

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

419

month . Continuing in this way, he arrived in Nahrwan after stopping
at several places. Tahir had also arrived there after making his
nephew lshaq bin Ibrahim his deputy in Riqqah, and in Nahrwan he
met Mamoon. As he was approaching Baghdad, Ibrahim bin Mehdi's
caliphate had met its end before he actually entered Baghdad and
Ibrahim was in hiding there.
After leaving Nahrwan, Mamoon entered Baghdad on 15 Safar 204
A.H. He held court there and keeping in view Tahir's conquests and
sacrifices, asked him to express his wish. Tahir said, "Please give up
wearing green clothes and permit all others to wear the traditional
black clothes and adopt the ways of the Abbasids." Mamoon agreed
and acted accordingly. This met with popular appreciation all over
Baghdad and Banu Abbas' s grievances were redressed. This
happened on 23 Safar 204 A.H.

Appointment of Governors and Important Events
Jn the month of Safar 204 A.H., Mamoon Rasheed entered Baghdad
and attended to improving his administration. He appointed Tahir bin
Husain officer of the Police Department and City Magistrate of
Baghdad, which were very important posts . compared to the
governorship of Jazirah and Sawad. The governorship of Kufa was
given to his brother Abu Isa and that of Basra to another brother
Saleh. Hijaz was given to Abdullah bin Husain bin Abbas biri Ali bin
Abi Talib, Mousil to Syed bin Anas Azdi, Riqqah to Abdullah bin
Tahir bin Husain, Jazirah to Yahya bin Ma'az and Armenia and
Azerbaijan to lsa bin Mohammad bin Abi Khalid .
The same year saw the death of the governor of Egypt, Sirri bin
Mohammad bin Hakam. After his death, his son Abdullah bin Sirri
succeeded him. Dawood bin Yazid, the governor of Sindh, also died
the same year. His place was taken over by Bishr bin Dawood on the
condition that he yVould send yearly 10,000 dirhams to Mamoon as
tax. The same year Hasan bin Sabal went mad and his condition
deteriorated so much that he had to be physically confined. Mamoon
appointed Ahmed bin Abi Khalid as his prime minister. There lived a
group near the Persian Gulf known by the name Zutt, who numbered
fifteen to twenty thousand. They committed highway robbery making

420

The History of Islam

the road to Basra perilous. Mamoon instructed the governor of Jazirah,
Yahya bin Ma' az, to punish them but they were not fully subdued .

Tahir the Governor of Khorasan
Mamoon Rasheed deputed Isa bin Yazid Jaludi in charge of the
expedition against the Zutt. In the same year, Tahir visited Mamoon
on the occasion of a normal gathering. Seeing Tahir reminded
Mamoon of his brother Ameen and tears rushed to his eyes. He was
also reminded of Tahir's oppressive measures, which he had used in
arresting, humiliating and killing Ameen. When Tahir asked him the
reason of his tears, he said, "There is something which is humiliating
if expressed and painful if concealed but who in the world is free from
pain and sorrow. I also tolerate this pain."
Tahir did not say anything at the moment put later on he ordered one
of Mamoon's courtiers Husain who was also p'resent on the occasion
to ask him the cause and sent him 100,000 dirhams through his clerk
Mohammad bin Haroon as a reward. Finding an opportune moment,
Husain asked Mamoon the reason tears were brought to his eyes. He,
on condition of not revealing it to anyone, said, "My eyes were filled
with tears to see Tahir on that particular day because I thought it was
the same Tahir who humiliated and killed my brother Ameen and
today he gives me so much respect." When Husain conveyed this
information to Tahir, he was very worried and began to envision his
own death assuming that Mamoon would certainly harm him one
day. Keeping it in his heart he said to the Prime Minister Ahmad bin
Abi Khalid, "I want to live away from Baghdad. Please send me as the
governor of a province and I won't forget this service of yours."
When Mamoon set out to Baghdad from Khorasan, he had made
Ghassan bin Abbad the governor of Khorasan. Ahmad bin Abi Khalid
went to Mamoon and said to him, "The thought of Ghassan bin Abbad
and Khorasan did not allow me to have a wink of sleep last night
because news is coming from the border that the Turks (Mongols) are
going to rebel soon. If this happens, Ghassan bin Abbad won't be abk
to save Khorasan. A more able and experienced man is needed there."
Mamoon said, "Yes, it is a matter of great concern. Can you tell me
who should be sent there?" Ahmad bin Abi Khalid said, " I don' t see

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

421

anybody better than Tahir bin Husain." Mamoon said, " Tahir bin
Husain may also rebel." Ahmad bin Abi Khalid said, "I stand surety
on behalf of Tahir. He won't rebel."
Mamoon sent for Tahir and made him the ruler of all the provinces of
the east from Baghdad to Khorasan up to Sindh, Balkh and Bukhara
and sent him off to the capital of Khorasan, Merv. His son Abdullah
was appointed the city magistrate and chief of police in Baghdad.
Tahir was given 1,000,000 dirhams plus a slave as a reward at the time
of departure. Mamoon said to him, "This is the reward for your
excellent service." Mamoon had briefed the slave that if he saw Tahir
bent upon rebellion he should remove him with poison. Tahir left
Baghdad at the end of Dhul Qada 205 A.H. and went to Khorasan.

Abdullah bin Tahir's Governorship
The news reached in 206 A.H. that Yahya bin Mu' az, the governor of
Jazirah, and Sirri bin Mohammad Hakam, the governor of Egypt, died
and they made their sons Ahmad and Obaidallah the governors of
Jazirah and Egypt respectively. Nasr bin Sheeth began to advance
towards Jazirah and Obaidallah raised the flag of rebellion in Egypt.
Mamoon appointed Ishaq bin Ibrahim bin Husain bin Mus'ab officer
to the Police Department in place of Obaidullah. Then he appointed
Abdullah bin Tahir, governor of Jazirah and sent him off with the
instructions first to fight Nasr bin Sheeth and after completing this,
send the forces to Egypt.
Abdullah bin Tahir at once left with the military forces, halted in
between Riqqah and Egypt and spread out groups of his soldiers to
besiege Nasr bin Sheeth. When Tahir bin Husain received the news in
Khorasan that the Caliph had made Abdullah governor of Jazirah and
in charge of all the western provif\.ces, he wrote a letter to Abdullah,
which contained his views on the principles of administration, grand
ethics and politics. Historically, it is considered to be one of the best
documents on ethics and the principles of administration.
Mamoon learned about it, had it copied and sent a c_opy to each of his
governors. Imam Ibn Khaldoon in his book A Preface to History and Ibn
Atheer in his book A Complete Riston; have recorded it. It is considered

422

The History of Islam

essential to include it in the study of ettiics. The same year Fadal bin
Rabi who went into hiding for fear of Mamoon and then eventually
went to Ibrahim bin Mehdi and joined his companionship and hid
himself when Ibrahim went underground, begged for forgiveness and
Mamoon forgave him.
A series of battles continued to be fought between Abdullah bin Tahir
and Nasr bin Sheeth and due to this disturbance no expedition could
be sent to Egypt. Abdur Rahman bin Ahmad became an insurgent in
Yemen but he was defeated in the same year. Marnoon sent Dinar bin
Abdullah to Yemen, Abdur Rahman bin Ahmad requested Dinar to
grant him security and pardon and left Yemen for Baghdad and
Yemen came under the control of Dinar bin Abdullah.

The Death of Tahir bin Husain the Governor
of Khorasan
Having arrived in Khorasan, he easily succeeded in establishing his
government and authority and he put an end to all the disturbances
there. It is a fact that he was the best choice for the governorship of
Khorasan. As mentioned above, Tahir was not satisfied with Marnoon.
He could have possibly avoided Marnoon and captured a vast
territory in order to protect him from corning into his grip. He had
seen the end of Fadal bin Saha! and the Barrnuks and had read about
Abu Muslim Khorasani. He also knew Marnoon's view about him,
which he had gathered from Husain Nadeem. In brief in Jurnad-alThani 207 A.H., Tahir made a sermon on Friday at the Central Mosque
in which he neither named Caliph Marnoon Rasheed nor did he offer
prayers for him. He simply prayed for the correction of the
community and stepped down from the pulpit.
Kulthum bin Thabit, an agent of the caliph was present there and he at
once sent the information to Mamoon in Baghdad. When Marnoon
read the report, he sent for the Prime Minister, informed him of the
events and instructed him to leave with the army for Khorasan
without any delay. He said to him," As you stand surety, you should
go to Khorasan and save it from his mischief and bring back Tahir as a
captive." Ahmad bin Abi Khalid prepared for departure. The next day
another report arrived that Tahir had fallen ill on Friday and suddenly

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

423

died on Saturday. The slave who was given to Tahir on the occasion of
his appointment to the rank of governor probably poisoned him when
he found out Tahir's negative intention about Mamoon.
Upon hearing the news of Tahir's death, Mamoon Rasheed said," All
praise is due to Allah who caused his death before mine." Then he made
his son Talha bin Tahir governor of Khorasan and sent Ahmad bin Abi
Khalid to Khorasan to establish Talha bin Tahir firmly there so that there
might not be any possibility of rebellion and disobedience there. It was a
trademark of Mamoon that he would penalize a rebel or revolutionary
and nothing ever stopped him from destroying him but he never
harmed the guilty party' s family and relatives. He usually would
endear himself to them even more by serving them. Ahmad bin Abi
Khalid went to Khorasan and Mawaraunnahr and punished the
insurgents. When he was informed that Tahir's brother Husain bin
Husain bin Mus'ab rebelled in Kerman he went there, arrested him and
presented him to Mamoon. Mamoon excused him. When Ahmad bin
Abi Khalid was returning from Khorasan to the capital Baghdad. Talha
bin Tahir presented to him 3,000,000 dirhams in cash and goods worth
100,000 dirhams as gift. He gave Ahmed's clerk 500,000 dirhams.
The same year Mamoon removed Isa bin Yazid Jaludi and assigned
Dawood bin Manjoor commander of the expedition to Zutt and put
the territories of Basra, Dajlah, Yamama and Bahrain under his
control. He made Mohammad bin Hafiz the ruler of Tabristan. The
same year the tribe of Banu Shaiban revolted against Mamoon.
Mamoon sent Syed bin Anas to punish and discipline them. The clash
with Banu Shaiban took place at Waskarah and they were defeated.
The same year Mamoon Rasheed sent Mohammad bin Jafar Amri as
ambassador to Nasr bin Sheeth who had been continuously suffering
defeat at the hands of Abdullah bin Tahir, who persuaded him to obey.
Nasr bin Sheeth said, "I am ready to reconcile with Mamoon Rasheed
provided I should not be forced to .go to his court." He came to Mamoon
and conveyed Nasr's condition. Mamoon swore that he would not rest
until he forced Nasr to present himself in his court. Nasr said to his
companions who were all Arabs, "How can Mamoon Rasheed, who
failed to subdue the toads of the Zutt community, get the better of us?"
He then geared up to give him a tougher fight than before.

The History of Islam

The Insurrection in Africa
North Africa, this province included central Tunis and Qairwan
situated between Egypt and Morocco, was given to Ibrahim bin
Aghlab in 184 A.H. on lease for 40,000 dinars as tax annually
during Haroon Rasheed's regime. He ruled over Africa very
efficiently. In Mamoon Rasheed's regime the ruler of North Africa
was Ibrahim's son Zeyadatullah bin Ibrahim bin Aghlab. In 208
A.H., there was a revolt in Tunis, which was engineered by
Mansoor bin Naseer. Mansoor bin Naseer captured most parts of
Tunis and besieged Zeyadatullah in the capital Qairwan.
Zeyadatullah defeated and forced Mansoor bin Naseer to flee but
Mansoor rallied his forces again and came to fight and the tug of
war continued from 208 A .H. to 211 A.H. At last, Mansoor bin
Naseer was killed by one of his own men and Zeyadatullah ruled
over Africa easily.

The End of Nasr bin Sheeth's Rebellion
Nasr bin· Sheeth's situation has been related above. He loved and
befriended Ameen bin Haroon. He prepared himself to revolt
when he heard of Ameen's murder and seeing the subjugation of
the Arab elements and the domination of the non-Arabs over the
Islamic caliphate. He had no sympathy with theAlawiites and his
opposition and hatred of the non-Arabs compelled him to fight
with Mamoon. Before Abdullah bin Tahir, Tahir bin Husain had
waged a low-key war with him. He prolonged the battle and
remained safe which, earned him great popularity and a reputation
for valor caused him to have a meteoric rise in status. He had
occupied almost all the regions of the province Jazirah and lived at
Kaisoom to the north of Halab. At last, in 209 A.H. Abdullah bin
Tahir encircled him from all sides and besieged him there. Being
compelled by the severity of the siege and his helplessness he
surrendered to Abdullah bin Tahir unconditionally. He sent him
to Mamoon in Baghdad who put him under surveillance in
Mansoor City.

425

The Murder of lbn Ayesha and the Arrest of Ibrahim
Ibrahim bin Mohammad bin Abdul Wahab bin Ibrahim Imam bin
Mohammad bin Ali bin Abdullah bin Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib alias
Ibn Ayesha took the oath for the caliphate at the hands of Ibrahim bin
Mehdi. When Ibrahim bin Mehdi went into hiding, Ibn Ayesha
followed suit. Ibrahim bin Aghlab and Malik bin Shaheen
accompanied them. When Abdullah bin Tahir caught Nasr bin Sheeth
and sent him to Baghdad, spies informed Mamoon that the day Nasr
bin Sheeth entered Baghdad, ibn Ayesha, Ibrahim bin Aghlab and
Malik bin Shaheen would revolt and create chaos. Mamoon had prior
information about their hiding in Baghdad and trying to win over
people to become accomplices in the conspiracy.
Upon receiving this news, the Baghdad police department was
ordered to arrest the ringleaders of the conspiracy at any cost. The
Police succeeded and three of the leaders except Ibrahim bin Mehdi
were taken into custody and put in jail. They tried to break out and
escape. When Mamoon was informed, he went to the jail. He had
them executed. Ibn Ayesha was the first Abbasid who was executed
by Mamoon. This happened in the month of Safar 210 A.H. After a
short time Ibrahim bin Mehdi was arrested while traveling in the
guise of a woman. He was presented in the court with the same
female clothes on.
Mamoon counseled with the people present in the court. They advised
him to execute Ibrahim but Mamoon's Prime Minister Ahmad bin Abi
Khalid said, "Please forgive him and pardon his rebellion." Mamoon
forgave him and Ibrahim bin Mehdi recited verses in praise of
Mamoon and Mamoon treated him with honor and love. This took
place in Rabi-al-Awwal 210 A.H .

Revolt in Egypt and Alexandria
It has been recorded above that the governor of Egypt, Sirri bin
Mohammad bin Hakam had nominated his son Obaidullah as his
heir-apparent at the time of his death. Immediately after assuming
power Obaidullah revolted. Busy fighting Nasr bin Sheeth, Abdullah
bin Tahir was not able to pay attention to Egypt and Mamoon because

426

The History of Islam

of disturbances on other fronts could not send another expedition to
Egypt. A great part of the province of Egypt went out of the control of
his government. It is said that Imam Malik bin Anas's followers who
lived in Cordova, the capital of Andulus (Muslim Spain), entered into
a conspiracy against the Ummayah Caliph Hakam bin Hisham. At the
last minute, the caliph received information about the plot and
destroyed and demolished the western part of the city of Cordova
where the conspiracy was centered .
He arrested the followers of Imam Malik and punished and expelled
them from Spain. One group settled in Morocco and another went to
Egypt and entered Alexandria by boat. After a short time, the newly
arrived Malikis revolted against Obaidullah's ruler. They expelled the
ruler from Alexandria, captured it and its surrounding territories and
made Abu Hafs Omar Baluti their Ameer. At this time Abdullah bin
Tahir was at war with Nasr bin Sheeth.
Obaidullah bin Sirri was not able to recapture the territory from the
Malikis. When Abdullah bin Tahir was free from fighting Nasr bin
Sheeth, he turned his attention to Egypt. Obaidullah bin Sirri fought
but Abdullah bin Tahir, defeated and surrounded him. Compelled by
the siege Obaidullah requested security and pardon and laid down
arms and surrendered himself to Abdullah. Abdullah then went to
Alexandria. Abu Hafs Omar Baluti was powerless and requested
security and pardon. Abdullah bin Tahir agreed on the condition that
Abu Hafs and his group should leave Alexandria and Egypt and go to
an island in the Roman Sea (Roman part of the Mediterranean Sea) .
Omar, along with his men, boarded the ships and went to Crete and
captured it and they settled there permanently and established their
rule there. This took place in 210 A.H. For the next 160 years the
dynasty of Abu Hafs Omar Baluti ruled over Crete. Finally, Armetius,
Constantine's son, took the island from the last ruler of the Abu Hafs
dynasty, Abdul Aziz and annexed it to Greece.

Zuraiq and Babak Khurmic
Zuraiq, whose real name was Ali bin Sadqah, was an Arab. He was
made governor of Armenia and Azerbaijan in 209 A.H. by Caliph
Mamoon Rasheed. He collected 40,000 men and declared his

The Caliphate of the Abbas ids (Second Phase)

427

independence and revolted against Mamoon.
Mamoon sent Ibrahim bin Laith bin Fadal to Azerbaijan. A new
religion had been spreading since the time of Haroon Rasheed in
northern Persia near the border of Azerbaijan, Jawedan, a Zoroastrian,
had founded this new religion. It professed murder, bloodshed and
adultry as lawful. ft resembled the Mazdki religion. When Jawedan
died, his disciple Babak Khurmi took possession of his wife and
became the head of his teacher's followers. During his regime, they
continued to grow in power and their number increased considerably.
Their constant plundering and looting put an end to peace in the
provinces there.
They began to challenge the government forces in 201 A.H. Several
times the governors suffered defeat and that quickened the rise of
Babak's power and influence considerably. In 209 A.H., Babak
captured the governor of Azerbaijan following which, Zuraiq was sent
there as governor.
Following Zuraiq's revolt in 211 A.H. there appeared two enemies
instead of one. Mamoon Rasheed ordered the governor of Mousil,
Syed bin Anas to fight against him. He attacked Zuraiq with a big
army but was killed and his soldiers escaped fleeing. Mamoon was
shocked to hear this. At the end of 211 A.H., he appointed
Mohammad bin Humaid Toosi, governor of Mousil and ordered him
to punish Zuraiq and Babak both. Zuraiq had occupied Mousil before
Mohammad bin Humaid Toosi left Baghdad with his army. They
fought near Mousil, Zuraiq lost and fled and Mohammad bin Humaid
entered Mousil as the victor.
He then recruited Arabs into his army, put his army and equipment in
order and marched towards Zuraiq. They clashed at the Zab River.
Zuraiq was defeated again and had to bear the humiliation of capture
and imprisonment. Mohammad bin Humaid went ahead removed all
his administrators and workers and put the whole province of
Azerbaijan under his own control. Then he decided to deal with Babak
Khurmi. Several battles were fought and Khurmi was pushed back to
the mountains. Khurmi and his forces climbed upon the mountain.
Mohammad bin Humaid followed them. Khurmi turned back and

428

The History of Islam

attacked and defeated Mohammad bin Humaid. Khurmi's men came
out of their hiding places and began a general massacre. During this
fight, Mohammad bin Humaid was killed. This victory encouraged
Babak Khurmi even more. This event took place in 212 A.H.
The same year Musa bin Hafs the governor of Tabristan died and
Mamoon appointed Musa's son in his place. Then he sent Hajib bin
Saleh to Sindh as its governor. The previous governor Bishr bin
Dawood refused to hand over the authority. A fight ensued and Bishr
lost and fled to Kerman.
The same year Mamoon recalled Abdullah bin Tahir from Egypt and
ordered him to finish the insurrection of Babak Khurmi. He wanted to
march to Babak Khurmi and marshal his troops in battle array at
Dinoor however, he received news. that the Khwarij had revolted in
Nishapur following the death of Talha bin Tahir, the governor of
Khorasan. Mamoon immediately sent a letter to Talha's brother
Abdullah bin Tahir appointing him governor of Khorasan and
ordered him to put down the revolt of the Khwarij. Abdullah bin
Tahir left Dinoor and turned to Nishapur. Babak Khurmi therefore
remained safe from Abdullah bin Tahir. No other general was
assigned to fight him. His mischief met its end following the death of
Ma moon. Abdullah bin Tahir arrived in Khorasan and succeeded in
putting down the rebellion of the Khwarij.

Miscellaneous Events
Mamoon Rasheed' s Prime Minister Ahmad bin Abi Khalid was very
wise, noble-hearted and good-natured, died the same year, 212 A.H.
Mamoon appointed Ahmad bin Yusuf in his place. Ahmad bin Abi
Khalid was a Syrian slave of Bani Amir he was a talented author and
administrator.
Ahmad bin Yusuf was a scribe in an undistinguished office. As
Mamoon knew his merit, he appointed him the post of prime minister.
In 212 A.H., Ahmad bin Muhammad Omari alias Ahmar al-Ain (Red
Eye) revolted in Yemen. Caliph Mamoon deputed Mohammad bin
Abdul Humaid popularly known as Abur Razi in Yemen . In 213 A.H.,
Mamoon deputed his own son Abbas in Jazirah, Thagoor and Awasim

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

429

and his own brother Abu Ishaq Motasim in Syria and Egypt. Abu
Ishaq on his own behalf sent Ibn Omairah Baz Isa as the ruler of
Egypt. In 214 A.H., groups of the Qais and Yemenia tribes created
chaos and wanted to kill ibn Omairah and revolted. Motasim himself
went to Egypt, subdued the insurgents and appointed administrators
and peace was restored there.
In 213 A.H., Mamoon appointed Ghassan bin Abbas the governor of
Sindh. The same year saw the death of Abur Razi, the governor of
Yemen, at the hands of rebels. Having been compelled Mamoon gave
the state of Yemen to Mohammad bin Ibrahim Ziyadi who descended
from Zeyad bin Abi Sufyan. He went there, founded the city of
Zubaid, he made it his head911arter and began to rule over Yemen. He
used to send presents and gifts to the Caliph and read his name in the
sermon. He governed independently until his death in 245 A.H. After
him, his descendents and slaves ruled there until 533 A.H.
In 214 A.H ., Mamoon made Ali bin Hisham the governor of Jabal,
Qum, Isfahan and Azerbaijan. In 214 A.H., Abu Bilal Sabi Shari
revolted . Mamoon sent his son Abbas to punish and discipline him.
Abu Bilal was killed in the fighting and the malevolence ended. In 215
A.H., the Emperor Michael died and his son Nofil succeeded him.
When he noticed signs of disobedience and enmity from the Romans,
Mamoon assigned Ishaq bin Ibrahim bin Mus' ab to the governorship
of Sawad, Halwan and Euphrates, left a deputy in Baghdad and he
invaded the Romans. He passed through Mousil, Antakia, Masisa and
Tartoos and entered Roman territory. He captured the fort of Qarah
and pulled down its fortifications. Then he sent Ashnas to the fort of
Sundus, and Ajeef and Jafar to the fort of Sanan with a division of the
army and these two forts were captured. Abbas bin Mamoon Rasheed
conquered the city of Maltiah. Motasim, who lived in Egypt, returned
and called on Ma moon. The Romans were humbled and begged ·to be
forgiven . Caliph Mamoon returned and went to Damascus. He was
still on the way when the Romans rallied their forces and suddenly
invaded Tartoos and Masisa. The civilians of the two cities were off
their guards thinking that the Romans had reconciled with the
Muslims and they were massacred mercilessly. As soon as Mamoon
heard this news, he retraced his steps causing fear in the Roman

430

The History of Islam

territories. The Islamic Army began to conquer fort after fort and city
after city. Caliph Mamoon continued to advance after conquering
many forts and territories and Motasim attacked and captured thirty
forts . On another flank, Yahya bin Aksam was busy conquering cities
and captured many Roman soldiers. Finally, the Roman emperor
begged to be excused for his impertinence. Caliph Mamoon then
ordered the army to return . He returned to Damascus and then
turned his attention to Egypt. He punished the rebels severely and put
things in order there. He left Egypt and went to Syria. He took one
year for this invasion and the return journey.
In 217 A.H., the Romans became involved in some rebellious activities
and Mamoon had to attack them again. Several battles were waged
and eventually Nofil, the Roman Emperor, again begged for
reconciliation. Mamoon again forgave him and then he returned from
the Roman territory. In 218 A.H., he had to punish and discipline the
Romans again. On his return, he ordered his son Abbas to build the
city of Tawana as a memorial. He constructed a fort one-mile square.
He had fortifications eight miles in circumference built and populated
the city with people from different cities.

Mamoon's Death
On the return from the Roman territories, Mamoon halted at
Baznadoon River, near Riqqah. He came down with a fever on 13
Jumad-al-Thani 218 A.H. and died on Thursday 18 Rajah 218 A.H.
Before his death, he assembled the noblemen, officials, scholars and
legal experts he made his will and gave instructions regarding his
burial. He forbade them and others to weep noisily after his death. He
called his brother Abu Ishaq Motasim, whom he had made his heir
apparent, advised him and drew his . attention to the principles of
running an administration. He continued to recite Qur'anic verses. At
the end he was heard saying, "O! You whose kingdom is eternal take
pity on him whose kingdom is decaying" after which, he breathed his
last. His brother Abu lshaq Motasim and his son Abbas brought him
from Riqqah to Tartoos and buried him there. He was 48 and he ruled
for 20 years and six months.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

431

His entire regime was passed in fighting battles and putting down
rebellions. He left the expedition of Zutt and Babak Khurmi
incomplete both of these problems could not be suppressed and
resolved during his caliphate. The era of his conquests against the
Romans had just begun when he was overtaken by death. At the end
of his life, he gave proof of his ability as a valiant general. He fought
against the Romans over several years continuously and he died in a
state of war on the battlefield.

Independence of Provinces and Countries
While the caliphs of Banu Umayyah were in power, Damascus was
the center and capital of the entire Islamic world. The Abbasids
inherited the caliphate of Banu Umayyah and Abdullah Saffah the
first Abbasid caliph in 132 A.H. became the inheritor of Banu
Umayyah and the ruler of the entire Islamic world. However, in a
short span of six years, from 138 A.H. Andulus was taken away from
the control of the Abbasids and a separate caliphate of Banu Umayyah
was established there. 172 A.H. another independent territory was
established in Morocco, which came to be known as the sultanate of
the Idrisids and Morocco left the jurisdiction of the Abbasids forever.
In 184 A.H., the territories of Tunis and Algeria, called the province of
North Africa, remained under the control of Banu Abbas in name
only. An independent kingdom was established by Ibrahim bin
Aghlab, which continued to exist for long years. In 205 A.H., Mamoon
Rasheed fixed Tahir bin Husain as the Governor of Khorasan and
Tahir's family ruled over Khorasan from that time. North Africa was
nominally under the Abbasid rule, similarly Khorasan under Tahir's
rule was only nominally under the Abbasids and only a small amount
of taxes were paid to the caliph. The name of the Abbasid caliph was
read at the Friday sermons but in the remaining affairs, Tahir and his
descendants were quite independent.
In 213 A.H., Mohammad bin Ibrahim Zeyadi was given the
governorship of Yemen and this kingdom remained with his family
for a long years. Yemen became technically free like Khorasan and
North Africa . In brief, between 138 A.H. and 213 A.H. a span of 75
years, five independent states were established. The Umayyahs in

432

The History of Islam

Andulus, the Idrisids in Morocco, the Aghlabs in North Africa, Tahir
and his descendants in Khorasan and the Zeyadis in Yemen all
established independent states.

Academic Developments
Mamoon Rasheed's regime was constantly involved in betrayal and
rebellion and he remained busy maintaining order in the administration
of the territories and provinces and punishing insurgents. It is beyond
expectation that a man who had to constantly monitor the situation and
the latest developments in his caliphate, could have paid attention to the
acquisition of knowledge and the development of the arts. It is
surprising that during his administration the sciences and arts
developed greatly. Mamoon achieved many remarkable feats in the
field of learning he patronized scholarship in an unprecedented manner
exceeding that of any other age. That is why his fame is so enduring.
Haroon Rasheed founded in Baghdad the institute of Translation and
the institute of Compilation called the House of Wisdom, where
educated of different foreign countries, followers of different religions
and scholars of various languages were always found at work.
Mamoon was interested in having Aristotle's works translated. He
wrote to the Roman Emperor requesting him to send all of Aristotle' s
works available with him. The Emperor hesitated. He consulted his
Christian scholars. They said to him,< "The books on philosophy are
under lock and key in our country and none is allowed to read and
teach them because they expel respect for religion from the people' s
hearts. We must send these books to the Caliph of Islam so that the
publicity of philosophy will dampen the religious spirit of the
Muslims." The Emperor had five camels loaded with these books and
sent them to Mamoon Rasheed. Mamoon assigned the work of
translation to Ishaq bin Kindi. He then sent his Christian scholars,
under his employment, to Rome and Greece to search and bring books
of science and the arts to him. A Christian scholar named Costa bin
Luka went to Rome of his own accord and brought many books from
there. Mamoon appointed him in the institute of Translation. In a
similar manner, he employed Zoroastrian scholars with high salaries
and entrusted them with the translation of the sciences and arts of that

l

l

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

433

civilization, when Indian kings knew the intererts of Mamoon they
sent Sanskrit scholars of repute to him as a gift to please him. The
translators at the institute of Translation received salaries up to 2,500
and these scholars number~d in the hundreds. Famous among them
are Yaqub Kindi, Hunain bin Ishaq, Costa bin Luka Balbakki, Abu
Jafar Yahya bin Adi, and Jibrail bin Bakhtishu. Besides salaries, the
translators used to receive gold or silver equal to the weight of the
books they translated. The books brought from Palestine, Egypt,
Alexandria, Sicily, Rome, Iran and India were translated into Arabic.
Most of the translators themselves authored books on sciences and
arts. Some meritorious translators were deputed for correction and
revision of previous translations.
It was during Mamoon Rasheed's regime that a famous scholar
Muhammad bin Musa Khwarzami wrote a book on Algebra in a
competition sponsored by Mamoon in which he formulated the
principles of Algebra and till this age those principle were not
brokend not amended. When the study of the Greek books revealed to
him that the earth was round, he called the scholars of Geography and
Astronomy and ordered them to measure the circumference of the
earth by selecting a vast and level field and measuring one degree of
it. The level field of Sanjar was chosen. At a point an angle was
formed with the height of the North Pole and then measuring with a
surveyor's measuring chain they moved straight towards the north.
When they had gone 69 and 2/3 miles to the North, one degree had
increased in the angle of the height of the North Pole. Therefore, if a
distance of one degree on the surface of the earth is 69 and 2/3 miles,
the circumference of the whole earth should be approximately 25,000
miles. 360 degrees multiplied by 69 and 2/3 miles is approximately
25,000 miles. When the experiment was repeated on the plains of
Kufa, the same results were arrived at.
[Editors note: The actual circumference of the earth is 24,902 miles. It
makes an interesting footnote since this event took place more than
650 years before the time of Columbus.]
He had an observatory built at Shamsiyah by Khalid bin Abdul Malik
Marwrozi and Yahya bin Mansoor, and appointed scholars of
Astronomy to study the heavenly bodies. He called scholars and those

who were enlightened from all areas of the caliphate by order. He
held academic seminars and symposia and participated in them in
person. Scholars of literature, poets, orators, doctors, in short, the
leaders in all fields the like of whom one could have hardly found in
the whole world at that time, were present in Baghdad. Asmai was the
most eminent scholar of Arabic compilation, syntax and literature could
not leave Kufa due to old age. His salary was sent to him there.
Important problems were sent to him in Kufa for solution. Farra
Nahwi collected and compiled the Science of Syntax with many books
written on this subject. A separate room in the royal palace was vacated
and reserved for him. Scholars used to come to be benefited as his
students. It was during Mamoon's regime that books on calligraphy
were written and its principles and rules were collected, classified and
set in order. In brief, it was due to Mamoon's patronage of learning
that the Muslims were fully exposed to the sciences and arts of Greece,
Iran, Egypt and India all in one place, the city of Baghdad.
Although the Muslims needed no other sciences and arts in the
presence of the Qur' an and Hadith, they turned to the ancient
philosophers and the physical sciences and systemized them as if they
were newly formulated. They worked with absolute freedom.
Although these foreign sciences and philosophies clashed with the
Qur' an at times, the servants of Islam had the opportunity to prove
these philosophies and principles wrong. A chain of clashes between
religion and science began. The academic superiority that Islam
achieved surpassed the conquests of territory achieved during the
dynasty of Banu Umayyah. These academic conquests elevated the
status of the caliphate of the Abbasids to be on par with Banu
Umayyah. However, from the standpoint of worldly conquests the
caliphate of the Abbasids can never be equal to the caliphate of Banu
Umayyah. On the contrary, if we evaluate on the basis of worldly
conquests the caliphate of Banu Abbas totally failed because it was not
able to hold all the territory it acquired from Banu Umayyah.

Rebuttal of a Charge
In some history books it was recorded wrongly that Mamoon Rasheed
Abbasi invaded an Indian king of Rajputana named Bapa Rawal 22
times and every time he was defeated and chased away by Bapa

Rawal. It is said that the same distortion has also been recorded in
some other books used in the Indian school system. Those who read in
their youth that Mamoon was defeated 22 times by Bapa,
automatically have a low image about Mamoon who, in order to
subdue an ordinary feudal lord, had to use all his might throughout
the long period of his Caliphate in vain. In the above pages, the
conditions of Mamoon Rasheed Abbasi's regime have been recorded
including the activities he was engaged in before he became Caliph.
After becoming the ruler of Khorasan, he lived in Merv. It was at that
time that Haroon Rasheed died at Tus. After that, Mamoon remained
in Tus six years and did not leave. It is correct that his armies put
down the rebellion in Kandahar and Kabul and Islam came to be
accepted in that territory by 200 A.H .
During that period, the king of Tibet embraced Islam and sent his
images of gold and silver to Caliph Mamoon Rasheed at Merv. Sind
was a part of his Caliphate and the governors, appointed by the
Caliph's court, ruled there. However, Mamoon never went there in
person. He left Merv and went to Baghdad. The details of that journey
are recorded in historical documents. However, there is no mention of
his journey to Sind or his invasion of India. After arriving in Baghdad,
he lived there for a long period. At the end of his life, he left Baghdad
to launch attacks on Roman territory. He also went to Syria and Egypt.
While he was returning from the campaigns against the Romans, he
died. It defies reason to find the period in which to record his
supposed attacks on India. It is possible that some governor of Sind
might have sent a division of an army to Rajputana to discipline and
punish some feudal Lord. But it probably was such an insignificant
expedition that it was not recorded in the historical documentation. If
it is said the governor of Sind sent an army, which was defeated by
Bapa and the Muslims did not record it to preserve their reputation.
Such an objection exposes the objector's dishonesty for he justifies
falsehood in the recording of history, in all other cases the Muslim
historians never concealed the defeats of Ma moon's armies and the
many failures of his generals. While mentioning the plundering by the
Zutt, they have mentioned Nasr bin Sheeth's taunt that Marnoon
could not even defeat the few toads of Zutt. The historians, who

supposedly committed the crime of distorting facts to favor him, could
have easily deleted the Zutt incident because after a short time, that
community was totally wiped off the surface of the earth by the
Romans and the incident could have remained hidden. However, this
baseless lie was fabricated to extol Bapa's valor. This is the same kind
of joking lie that the Hindu historians have stated about Vikrmaditya,
without any shame that he went to Italy and defeated the Roman
emperor Julius €aesar in Rome. This is probably a reply to Alexander's
invasion of India where they harmlessly even the historical score with
their fabrication. Such light talk may provide a momentary pleasure at
village meetings but it is not the recording of history.

Nature and Habits
In respect to prudence, determination, tolerance, scholarship and
valor Caliph Mamoon Rasheed was superior to all amongst the Banu
Abbas dynasty. He used to say," Amir Muawiya ~ needed Amr bin
Aas and Abdul Malik needed Hajjaj but I needed no one." He had a
predilection to the Shiite way he felt that the Alawiites deserved
respect and the Caliphate more than all others. That was why he
removed his brother Motamin and made Ali Raza his successor and
had his daughter married to him. He had a mind to vacate his
Caliphate and install him as Caliph in his own presence. However,
after the passage of ten years and during the last period of his
Caliphate he changed his mind following the betrayal and rebellion of
the Alawiites. He also wanted to issue instructions that none should
remember Amir Muawiya .;. with respect and he should be declared a
wrong doer but he did not do so at the instance of the people.
He was also very fond of reading the Qur' an. During some Ramadan,
he finished the Qur'an once everyday. When he made Ali Raza his
heir-apparent, a few from among Banu Abbas said to him, "Please
don't hand over the Caliphate to the Alawites." Mamoon said,
"During his regime Ali bin Abi Talib .;. had deputed Banu Abbas to
govern most of the provinces. I want to reciprocate and give power
and the Caliphate to their descendants."
When Mamoon provided an opportunity to the followers of all faiths
and religions to give vent to their opinions openly at Darul Munazirah,

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

437

the institution that he created to allow free exchange of thought,
academic discussions began to take place in an unrestrained way. Hair
splitting and sophistic techniques more dedicated to debate than the
seeking of truth evolved. The points of debate, which had little to do
with the science of the religion, produced antagonistic parties over
frivolous philosophies. Mamoon was drawn into these debates and
became a participant in this competition. These unrestrained religious
debates resulted in the creation of unnecessary ·and insignificant
problems. There w~s a debate about the creation of the Qur'an.
Mamoon was convinced by the school of thought that maintained that
the Quran was created and he began to perpetrate atrocities on those
who did not agree .with him. The consequence of that pressure and
oppression was disastrous. The scholars of the opposite points of view
began to oppose him more vehemently and that generated even more
rigid antagonism and prejudice to the extent that even after his death
some scholars of Islam have been greatly agonized on account of this
unreal and unnecessary problem.
Abu Muhammad Yazidi says that he used to teach Mamoon in his
childhood. Once the servants complained to him saying, "When you
go away, he beats the servants and behaves wantonly with them."
Yazidi struck him with his stick seven times. Mamoon was weeping
and wiping his eyes when the Prime Minister Jafar Barmuk appeared
while Yazidi left. Jafar talked to Mamoon until he laughed and then
left. Yazidi came back to him and said, "I was fearing that you would
complain to Jafar." Mamoon said, "Leave Jafar I can not complain to
my father for you had beaten me for my benefit." Yahya bin Aksam
says: "One day I was sleeping in Mamoon Rasheed's room, Mamoon
was also asleep. He awakened me saying, 'Please see if there is
something near my feet?' I looked but found nothing but he was not
satisfied. He called the servants. They lighted a lamp and saw that a
snake was sitting under his bed. I said to him, 'you possess the
knowledge of the unseen along with your other merits.' He said I seek
refuge in Allah! What are you saying?' The fact is that I just haq a
dream in which somebody warned me against the danger of a naked
sword. I at once woke up and I felt that some ugly incident would
take place very soon. The bed was the nearest thing. So I looked into it
and the snake was found ."

The History of Islam

Mohammad bin Mansoor says: "Mamoon used to say that ' a noble
man is he who bears the atrocities perpetrated against him by his
superior and does not persecute him who is inferior to him."' Sayeed
bin Muslim says: "Mamoon once said, 'If the criminals come to know
how much I love forgiveness, their fear will vanish and their hearts
will be filled with joy."'
Mamoon said to a criminal, "By Allah, I shall slay you." He said,
"Please be tolerant for softness is.half of forgiveness. " Mamoon said,
"Now I have sworn an oath." He said, "If you go to Allah as a violator
of an oath, it is better than to go to Him as a killer." Mamoon forgave
him. Abdus Salam bin Salah says: "One day I was sleeping in
Mamoon's room. The lamp was going out. He found that his servant
was asleep. Mamoon left the bed, set the wick right and went back to
sleep." In another incident Mamoon would say, "Often it happens that
I am in the bathroom and the servants abuse and accuse me. They
think that I have not heard them but I hear and forgive them and
never let them know that I have heard them."
One day Mamoon was sailing in a boat on the Tigris River. There was
a curtain hanging separating the compartments on the boat. On the
opposite side were sitting some sailors who did not know that
Mamoon was there. One of them said, "Mamoon must be thinking
that I have love and honor for him in my heart but he does not
understand that I have no love and honor left in my heart for a man
who had his own brother killed." Mamoon began to smile and said,
"Friends! Tell me how I can endear myself to this great man."
Yahya bin Aksam says, "I was sleeping in Mamoon's room. I was
about to fall asleep when Mamoon wanted to cough. He stuffed his
mouth with the lower part of his shirt to prevent making a
disturbance for the other sleepers." He used to say, "To me the
domination of an argument appears to be better than the domination
of nature or power for the latter will vanish with the passing away of
nature or power and the former never meets its end." He used to say,
"Love of flattery is bad for a king. Worse is a judge's narrow
heartedness, which precedes the comprehension of the issue
concerned. Still worse is the lack of wisdom on the part of the legal
scholars in the matters of religion. Worse still is the miserliness of th

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

439

rich, making fun of the elders, laziness of the youth and display of
cowardice on the battlefield."
Ali bin Abdur Raheem Marwrozi says, "Mamoon used to say, 'The man
is an enemy to his own self who wants the nearness of the person who
likes to be away from him, honors the man who does not respect him
and feels delighted at the praise of a man whom he does not know."'
Hudba bin Khalid says, "One day I was partaking of a meal with
Mamoon. When the tablecloth was removed, I began to pick up the
small pieces of food that had fallen on the floor and eat them.
Mamoon said, 'Are you still hungry?' I said, ' I have had my fill but a
Hadith says that one who eats the fallen bits of food after the removal
of the tablecloth will never be poor.' He then gave me 1000 dinars."
Once Haroon Rasheed visited Kufa after Hajj and requested the
presence of the scholars of Hadith from there. All of them came except
Abdullah bin Idris and Isa bin Yunus who refused to come. Haroon
Rasheed sent his two sons Ameen and Mamoon. When they went to
Abdullah bin Idris, he addressed Ameen and narrated a hundred
Hadiths to him. Mamoon was sitting and listening. When he stopped
narrating, Mamoon said, "If you permit me, I can narrate all those
Hadith." He granted permission and Mamoon narrated all the
Hadiths quite correctly.
Ibn Idris was stunned by Mamoon's sharp memory. He said, "I was
never stunned into silence by the reply of a person except once by the
inhabitants of Kufa. They came and complained against the governor
of Kufa. I said, "You lie that governor is very just." They said,
"Undoubtedly we are liars and Amir al-Muminin is truthful. But why
has our city alone been selected and reserved for his justice. Please
send him to some other city so that, another city should also be
benefited from his justice as our city has been benefited." l had to say
under compulsion, "Well then, go. I have dismissed him."
Yahya bin Aktham states, "One night I was sleeping in Mamoon's
room. I felt thirst in middle of the night. I grew restless and began to
turn from one side to the other. Mamoon asked me the reason. I said,
'I am thirsty.' He left his bed, brought water and made me drink it. I
said, ' Why didn't you call a servant?' He said, 'My father heard from

The History of Islam

440

his father and he heard from his grandfather and he heard from Uqba
bin Amir '*, that the Prophet ~ said, 'The leader of the people is their
servant."'
The most praiseworthy and remarkable thing about the acts and
achievements of Caliph Mamoon Rasheed is the fact that while
nominating his successor he gave proof of his good intention and
great courage and was not trapped by his paternal affection as the
Caliphs before him who continued the injustice of choosing their sons
as their successor and thereby strengthened the curse of hereditary
rule on the Islamic Caliphate.
By nominating Imam Ali Raza as his heir-apparent and depriving the
dynasty of the Abbasids he acted freely, selected the best man for the
job in the way adopted by Abu Bakr ~ in making Umar bin Khattab ,;..
his successor. However, Mamoon came to know very soon that the
Abbasids would not accept it willingly and it would lead the Islamic
world into trouble by creating disorder and riots. Imam Ali Raza' s
death nipped Ma moon's wishes in bud. Then he selected his own
brother Abu Ishaq,Motasim as his successor and deprived his own son
Abbas of the throne despite the latter's ability to run the administration
and the Caliphate. Since Motasim was more capable than Abbas in
administrative affairs, he selected Motasim and did not prefer his son.
Mamoon's predecessors had continuously committed the fault of
fixing two successors in place of one. Had he followed them, he would
have nominated his own son Abbas and been satisfied that his own
son would be Caliph after Motasim but he disliked and rejected this
act that had no Islamic precedent. He is admired for many things but
for this deed, he is not appreciated as much as he deserves.

Motasim Billah
Abu Ishaq Motasim bin Haroon Rasheed was born of a slave girl
named Barwah at Zabtarah in Roman territory in 180 A.H. when
Caliph Haroon Rasheed himself was attacking the Roman territories.
Haroon loved him most and.whenever he distributed anything among
his children, he used to give him the largest share. Motasim was not
interested in acquiring education. He spent his childhood days in
games and sports. Haroon had assigned a slave to live with him and

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

441

educate him whenever he had a chance. When the slave died Haroon
said to Motasim, "Now your slave has died. Say what is your
intention now?" Motasim said, "Amir al-Muminin! Yes, the slave is
dead and I have gotten rid of the books." This indicates that Motasim
was not fond of studying. The fact is that he had only a little formal
education. Since he was brought up in the company of the royal
family and scholars and had seen the educational meetings during
Haroon and Mamoon' s regimes, his knowledge was sufficient.
Motasim was a heavily built wrestler and a brave man. He was also a
good general. Ibn Abi Dawood says: "Motasim often outstretched his
arm towards me and said, 'Bite it as hard as you can.' I bit and he said,
'I did not feel anything.' I bit again but in vain. He often broke the
wrist of his opponents with the pressure of only two fingers."
Motasim sometimes composed poems and honored the poets. He was
also infected with the problem concerning the debate about the
creation of the Qur'an like his brother Mamoon Rasheed. Just as
Mamoon persecuted the scholars in connection with this problem,
Motasim Billah Abbasi also followed suit. He mercilessly tortured
Imam Ahmad bin Hambal 11
in connection with this problem.
u-)

Motasim Billah was the governor of Syria and Egypt during the
Caliphate of Mamoon Rasheed. When Mamoon invaded the Roman
territory, Motasim exhibited such bravery that Mamoon was pleased
and made him his heir apparent and deprived his own son, Abbas.
The oath for the Caliphate of Motasim Billah was taken the day after
the death of Mamoon at Tartoos on 19 Rajab 218 A.H. corresponding
to 10 August 833 A.D.
Fadal bin Marwan was his Christian assistant. When the news of
Mamoon's death reached Baghdad, Fadal bin Marwan took the oath
for Motasim's Caliphate from the inhabitants of Baghdad. Having
reached Baghdad, Motasim made Fadal bin Marwan his Prime
Minister. When the oath for Motasim was taken, most of the military
personnel wanted Abbas bin Mamoon saying that he deserved the
Caliphate more than anybody else. Motasim sent for Abbas and he
took the oath at Motasim's hands. After the oath, the unrest subsided
by itself. The city of Towanah was built under the supervision of
Abbas. Immediately after becoming Caliph, Motasim ordered

442

The History of Islam

Towanah to be demolished and rendered desolate and the citizens
were sent back from where they had come. After its desolation, he
brought all the goods, which he could, from there to Baghdad and
burned the rest.

The Revolt of Mohammad bin Qasim
Mohammad bin Qasim bin Ali bin Omar bin Ali bin Husain bin Ali
bin Abi Talib lived near the mosque in Madinah and spent his time in
prayer. A Khorasani visited him and coaxed him saying that he
deserved the Caliphate and that he should take the oath from the
people secretly. He therefore began to gather those people who came
from Khorasan to perform Hajj and passed through Madinah. They
would take the oath for his Caliphate.
Thus when a good number of followers gathered in Khorasan,
Mohammad bin Qasim went to Jurjan with the same Khorasani who
originally incited him and went into hiding there safely organizing
himself. Oaths of supporters continued to be taken there secretly. The
rich and the noble visited him. At last Mohammad bin Qasim
revolted. The governor of Khorasan Abdullah bin Tahir sent an army
to quell the riots. There were several fights on the outskirts of Talqan.
Mohammad bin Qasim was defeated in every battle. Finally, he
escaped alone to save his life. He was arrested in Nasa and brought to
Abdullah bin Tahir who sent him to Motasim in Baghdad. He put him
under the custody of Masroor Kabeer. Mohammad bin Qasim arrived
in Baghdad on 15 Rabi-al-Awwal 219 A.H. and escaped unnoticed
from captivity on the first night of Shawwal which corresponds to the
Islamic holiday Eid al-Fitr following Ramadan in 219 A.H.

The Extermination of the Zutts
In Jumad-al-Thani 219 A.H., Caliph Motasim deputed his general
Ajeef bin Ambasa to finish the battle of Zutt. He had been at war with
those plunderers for seven months an at last he forced them to ask for
safety and pardon by themselves in Dhul Hijjah 219 A.H. and they
surrendered themselves to Ajeef. Ajeef took them numbering 17,000
including women and children to Baghdad. That included 12,000 men
who were physically fi.t to fight. Ajeef entered Baghdad on 10

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

443

Muharram 220 A.H. Motasim himself boarded a boat and came to
Shamamah. He inspected the Zutt captives and ordered that they
should be settled near Zarbah close to the Roman border. They were
therefore resettled there. The Romans later decided to attack the
Islamic territories and led a surprise night attack in this area and
massacred them not sparing a single soul. Thus, the group of Zutt met
their end.

The City of Samarra
Caliph Motasim was a soldier. He turned his attention more towards
the military. His predecessors, the Abbasi Caliphs, attached more
importance to the Khorasanis. They had rarely relied on the Arab
army. Although they faced dangers from the Khorasanis more than
once, they depended more on the Khorasanis and the Iranians in
comparison with the Arabs on the whole. The Arab elements continued
to become weaker. Motasim Billah concentrated on the organiZuttion
and improvement of the military from the beginning of his Caliphate.
He purchased thousands of Turkish slaves and formed an army. He
also had Turks from Farghana and Ashrosna (Turkistan) recruited.
He liked their style of fighting and their ability to bear extreme
hardship. Until this time the army was composed of Arabs and the
Iranians and they were always at war with the Turks along the
borders of the Islamic territory. The Turks and their leaders were
subjugated and had to pay taxes, then they revolted and fought
against their conquerors. They were not considered reliable to be
recruited into the army. Motasim however, recruited them into his
army in such large numbers and appointed them to so many high
posts that they were on par with the Iranian military in respect to their
number. The Arab tribes continued to decrease until only the Egyptian
and Yemeni tribes were left in the Caliph's army. The Caliph
combined all the Arab divisions and formed a separate army and
called it Magharba.
The Turk army was made up of soldiers from Samarkand, Faraghana
and Ashrosna, which was very powerful and was named Faraghna.
The Khorasani army developed an enmity with the Faraghna army.
Since Caliph Motasim had organized the new Turkish army with great

444

The History of Islam

care, all facilities were made available to its soldiers. Their uniforms
were more beautiful, their horses were better and their salaries and
allowances were more than the others. ,The Khorasanis began to
quarrel with them in Baghdad. Observing the situation, Motasim set
up a military cantonment at a distance of 90 miles from Baghdad on
the Qatoon tributary of the Tigris River. He b~ilt a palace for himself,
houses for the soldiers, a large market and a central mosque. Other
necessary buildings were erected and he settled the Turks there and
then he moved to the newly built city.
He called it Surra man Raa, which came be known as Samarra in
common usage. It was built in 220 A.H. and the same year it was
declared the capital in place of Baghdad. In a short time, it was on par
with Bi'tghdad in respect of its beauty and population and the Turks
instead of the Arabs and Khorasanis came to dominate over the
. capital and the Caliph. The same year Mohammad bin Ali Raza bin
Musa bin Qasim bin Jafar Sadiq died and was buried in Baghdad.

The Removal of Fadal bin Maawan
The same year, 220 A.H:, the Caliph received complains of corruption
and dishonesty against his Prime Minister Fadal bin Marwan. He
assigned auditors to take account bf the expenditures. They found a
discrepancy of 1,000,000 dinars. The Caliph deducted this sum from
his goods and belongings and put him under surveillance in a village
near Mousil. He then appointed Mohammad bin Abdul Malik bin
Abban bin Hamza as his Prime Minister in place of Fadal. Mohammad
bin Abdul Malik was known as Ibn Zayyat because his grand father
Abban lived in a village and brought oil from there and sold it in
Baghdad. Mohammad bin Abdul Malik was brought up and educated
in Baghdad and achieved high qualifications. The period he was
Prime Minister extended to the regimes of Motasim, Wathiq and
Motawakkil. Just as Qadi Yahya bin Aksam during Haroon Rasheed's
regime was not a minister, yet he was more powerful and influential
than the Prime Minister and always accompanied Mamoon, similarly
Qadi Yahya bin Aksam's disciple Ahmed bin Abi Dawood lived with
Motasim. Though he too was not a minister, he enjoyed as much
power and authority as the Prime Minister did. It is said that whatever

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

445

atrocities Mamoon and Motasim perpetrated on the scholars in
connection with the debate about the created nature of the Quran
were done at the insistence and instigation of these two men. However,
it was Ibn Abi Dawood at Motasim's court, who supported the Arabs
and it was due to him that they commanded some respect in the
capital otherwise the Turks and the Iranians dominated everywhere.

Babak Khurmi and Afsheen Haider
It has already been mentioned that all the generals of Mamoon
Rasheed who went to fight against Babak Khurmi were defeated.
They had made the city Buz their headquarters and the people of the
adjoining areas recognized his rule. All the governors and noblemen
were afraid of him and entertained his men to win his pleasure.
Caliph Motasim assigned Abu Sayeed Mohammad bin Yusuf to
punish Babak. Abu Sayeed first had all the forts situated between
Ardabil and Azerbaijan repaired which Babak had damaged or
demolished. Then he gathered the necessary provisions of food and
weapons and then he marched towards Babak. A division of Babak's
army launched a night attack on one of the cities.

When Abu Sayeed was informed of the night attack, he took his army
and set out in pursuit. He caught up with them and fought and
defeated Babak's army. Many of his men were killed and captured
and the goods they~ had looted were recovered. This was the first
setback, which Babak' s army received. Its impact was that those
leaders who supported Babak out of fear but were actually against
him began to sympathize with the Islamic forces. One of Babak' s
generals Asmat came to stay at the fort of Azerbaijan, Mohammad bin
Bayeeth the caretaker, made arrangements for a feast, and lodged his
men as usual. He treated them with honor but arrested them at night
and sent him to Caliph Motasim and killed his men. Caliph Motasim
made him divulge the secrets of Babak's cities and forts. He told him
everything in the hope of being released. Motasim imprisoned Asmat
and decided to send a more powerful and veteran general to fight
with Babak and put an end to his evil for good.
Haider bin Kaoos was Motasim' s greatest general. He was the son of
the king of Ashrosna whose family name was Afsheen. He had

446

The History of Islam

embraced Islam and his Islamic name was Haider and was known as
Afsheen Haider. He was the commander in chief of the entire
Faraghna or Turkish army. He had accepted Islam at Motasim's hands
during Mamoon Rasheed's Caliphate and was constantly in his
service. During the period of his governorship of Syria and Egypt,
Motasim had tested his military services and found him to be a real
veteran. After assuming power he organized the Faraghna army, he
appointed Afsheen Haider, Itakh, Ashnas, Ajeez, Waseef and Bagha
Kabeer all Turks, leaders of the army. Afsheen Haider was made the
commander in chief.
He had palaces built for all these commanders in Samarra. After
assessing Babak's power and the difficult terrain of mountain
passages and passes, Caliph Motasim sent Afsheen Haider to fight
him. Besides divisions of Turks, Khorasani and Arab armies were also
sent under his command. A number of local fighters also set out for
the purpose of Jihad. After reaching there, Afsheen began a chain of
battles very carefully and efficiently. Having sent him with full
equipage and men, Motasim later dispatched Itakh with a fresh army
as reinforcements. After a few days, he sent Bagha Ka beer with arms
and necessary provisions. Afsheen received 10,000 dirhams daily in
addition to all military expenditures, food and other necessities when
at war and siege and 5,000 dirhams from the Caliph's treasury besides
his salary when at peace during the entire period of war with Babak.
The war continued for a year and a half.
Afsheen reached Ardabil and continued establishing outposts at short
distances in order to facilitate food supply and communication. Then
he entered the mountains, which were under Babak's occupation and
fixed the army at strategic locations, setup communications and
coordinated the movements of his commanders by flags or
messengers and marched on by pushing Babak' s army back towards
the fort of Buz. He also made careful defensive arrangements against
night attacks and ambushes. The climate and the severe cold of winter
made the Arabs and the Iraqis more uncomfortable than the
Khorasanis and the Turks.
Jafar bin Dinar Khayyat was the chief of the local fighters who had
come out for Jihad. He, Bagha and Itakh fought heroically. Babak and

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

447

his generals Azeen and Tarah Khan exhibited considerable military
skill. Abu Sayeed who had been at war with Babak long before
Afsheen's arrival began to work under him along with his army. The
long chain of battles resulted in Babak Khurmi's defeat and captivity.
He was sent to Caliph Motasim at Samarra. Babak and his brother
were arrested in Shawwal 222 A.H. and Afsheen was went to Samarra
in Saffar 223 A.H. At the receipt of the news of victory and Babak's
capture, Motasim passed orders that Afsheen should be presented at
all the stages between Barzand (Azerbaijan) to Samarra with a robe of
honor and a well-saddled horse and accorded a royal and grand
reception. When Afsheen approached the capital Samarra, the
Caliph's son Wathiq received him at the city gate.
When he appeared in the Caliph's court, he was seated on a golden
chair and a crown was put on his head. A very expensive robe of
honor and a sum of 2,000,000 dirhams was given to him as a reward
and 1,000,000 dirhams was given to be distributed among his soldiers.
Babak was slain by the order of Caliph Motasim at Samarra. _His
brother was sent to Baghdad where he was killed. Their dead bodies
were hung up for display. Babak had maintained his influence for
about 20 years. During that period, he killed 155,000 people. 7,600
Muslim men and women were rescued and released from his captivity.
Afsheen arrested 17 men and 30 women from Babak's family.

The Capture of Amurya and the Battle of Rome
When Babak Khurmi felt desperate during the siege by the Islamic
army he dispatched a letter to Nofil bin Michael, the Roman emperor
stating: "Motasim has sent all his forces against me. Baghdad, Samarra
and all the provinces are quite defenseless at this time and all the
leaders of the army are at war with me. You will not get a better
chance to capture these territories don't let it slip through your fingers
and march on Baghdad conquering the Islamic territories." Babak ~It
that if the Roman emperor invaded, the Islamic army would have to
be divided into two parts reducing its pressure on him. The Roman
emperor read the letter and attacked with 100,000 soldiers but by that
time the war with Babak had erded, and the Islamic army was poised
to stop him. Nofil first launched a night attack on Zabtarah and killed

448

The History of Islam

all the men who fought against him and captured their women and
children. Then he turned to Maltiya and did the same thing there.
The news of the capture and ruin of Zabtarah and Maltiya reached
Motasim on 29 Rabia Thani 223 A.H. The narrator also told of a
Roman soldier dragging away a Hashimite woman and she was
shouting, "O Motasim, 0 Motasim." As soon as he heard this,
Motasim stood up from the throne of Caliphate saying, "Labbaik,
Labbaik" (I am here, I am here). He jumped on his horse and ordered
the drum of departure to be beaten. The soldiers and their leaders
came and joined him. All the royal army and a group of Mujahideen
(those fighting for the cause of Allah) followed him. He sent Ajeef bin
Ambasa and Omar Farghani ahead with a fast moving vanguard to
reach Zabtarah as soon as possible and console and boost the moral of
the people there and drive away the Romans but the Romans had left
by the time the two commanders arrived there.
Then Caliph Motasim arrived with his army. He wanted to know the
strongest and most important city of the Romans in that area. He was
told that Amurya was such a strong and fortified fort and city. It was
very important also because it was the birth place of the Roman
emperor Nofil . Motasim said, "Zabtarah is my birth-place. The Roman
emperor has ruined it and in retaliation I will ruin his birth place
Amurya." He therefore made available equipage and war material on
an unprecedented scale. Then he made Ashnas the commander of the
vanguard. Mohammad bin Ibrahim bin Mus'ab was made the
supplier of reinforcements to him. Then he fixed Itakh on the right
flank and Jafar bin Dinar Khayyat on the left flank, giving the middle
part to Ajeef bin Ambasa. Having made these arrangements, he
entered Roman territory and made Ajeef bin Ambasa the supreme
commander of all the forces. He arrived at Saluqiya and encamped
along the tributary San, which was at a distance of one day's journey
from Tartoos.
Here it must be remembered that Motasim had already sent Afsheen
to Armenia as ,governor of Armenia and Azerbaijan. Afsheen with his
army entered Roman territory. A part of the Islamic army marched
forward and occupied Angoora where it captured a big stock of grain,
which the Muslims needed to continue the fight. The Roman emperor

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

449

wanted to confront the Islamic army at Angoora and had made all the
necessary materials and food available there. However, the army
stationed there and their commanding officer had a falling out and as
a result, the army retreated. Meanwhile the Roman emperor himself
had gone to the Armenian border to stop Afsheen's advance. After
being defeated, he turned back to Angoora but the Muslims had
already captured it. Being compelled he then turned to Amurya and
made the necessary provisions of all war materials available there. He
collected the army from all comers of his empire and became busy
securing all kinds of military weapons. At Angoora Motasim
encamped and waited for Afsheen, where he called upon the Caliph
and joined him on the expedition.
At the end of Shaban 223 A.H., Caliph Motasim along with his army
left Angoora to declare war. He fixed Afsheen on the right flank and
Ashnas on the left and he remained in the middle. The Islamic army
marched forward and laid siege to Amurya, and after- making
fortifications started moving towards the battlements. From 6
Ramadan 223 A.H. to the end of Shawwal 223 A.H., 55 days in all,
they kept Amurya encircled and finally conquered it. They captured
or killed the people there. Motasim continued to sell the booty for five
days and what remained was consigned to flames . Then he ordered
Amurya to be pulled down and leveled to the ground. The army
destroyed it completely. Emperor Nofil fled and went to
Constantinople and Caliph Motasim divided the captives among his
generals and marched towards Tartoos.

The Death of Abbas bin Mamoon
Ajeef and Afsheen were rivals. Caliph Motasim often criticized Ajeef's
activities and that amounted to his humiliation in Afsheen's eyes.
Consequently, Ajeef's loyalty underwent a change and he began to
hatch a conspiracy against the Caliph. On the occasion of the invasion
of the Roman Empire, he said to Abbas Mamoon who was with him
on the journey, "You committed a blunder mistake by taking the oath
at Motasim' s hands. Had you expressed your mind to be Caliph
yourself, all the army chiefs were ready to lend you support." This
inducement and more set Abbas thinking. Ajeef mentioned such

450

The History of Islam

things so many times that Abbas decided to revolt. It was proposed
that first of all the army chiefs should be converted to their views and
then by killing Motasim, Afsheen and Ashnas simultaneously, they
would declare Abbas's Caliphate. They acted as proposed and many
soldiers were persuaded to recognize Abbas as Caliph. While
returning from Amurya after its conquest, Motasim stumbled upon
the conspiracy.
Motasim first imprisoned Abbas and handed him over to Afsheen. Then
Masha bin Saha!, Omar Farghani and Ajeef were arrested one after
another and thrown into captivity. First Masha bin Saha! was slain.
Then they reached Banj and put Abbas into a sack and stitched it closed
and caused him to die of suffocation. Then they reached Nasiban, had a
ditch dug out and buried Farghani in it alive. Then they reached Mousil
and there Ajeef was also stuffed into tJ.·sack and sewn closed leading to
his suffocation and death. After entering Samarra, Motasim had all the
descendants of Caliph Mamoon Rasheed rounded up and put under
house arrest until they died. During this journey, Caliph Motasim
picked up all the suspects and hachhem killed.

The Revolt of Tabristan
Mazyar bin Qarin, the ruler of Tabristan, was the subordinate and paid
taxes to the governor of Khorasan, Abdullah bin Tahir. There developed
an estrangement between them. Mazyar said, "I shall send the taxes
directly to the capital but not directly to Abdullah bin Tahir." Abdullah
bin Tahir took it as an affront to his rule and disliked it. The quarrel
continued for sometime as Mazyar continued to send the taxes directly
to the capital where Abdullah bin Tahir's man continued receiving it.
During the war with Babak, Afsheen was empowered to spend money
freely and Motasim continued to dispatch all types of goods and
money to him. Afsheen was highly economical in spending it and the
rest he used to send. to his native land Ashrosna (Turkistan).
These goods meant for Azerbaijan used to pass through Khorasan.
When Abdullah bin Tahir came to know that Afsheen was sending
provisions, arms, and money to his motherland, he realized that
somethiRg was wrong. He caught and imprisoned the men who

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

451

carried these goods, seized them and wrote to Afsheen, "Some of your
soldiers were carrying such and such goods, I arrested and jailed them
and distributed the goods among my soldiers because I am preparing
to invade Turkistan. Though they told me that they were sent by you,
their statement appears to be absolutely false because had they not
been thieves and been sent by you, you would have definitely
informed me." At the sight of the letter, Afsheen felt extremely
ashamed and wrote back to him that they were not thieves but his
men. At the receipt of the letter Abdullah bin Tahir released them but
the goods he had seized were not returned.
He sent a secret report about it to Caliph Motasim although he did not
pay any obvious attention to it. Afsheen wanted to establish his own
government in Ashrosna and he was making preparations for it in
advance. When he returned to Samarra after the war with Babak was
over, he hoped that Motasim would make him the governor of
Khorasan and he would have an opportunity to found his own
kingdom. But Motasim made him the governor of Armenia and
Azerbaijan instead and this disturbed his plan.
Immediately after that, the Roman war took place and Afsheen had to
participate, Motasim himself was present and the man he made the
commander-in-chi~f was Ajeef who considered himself to be the rival
of Afsheen. What happened to Ajeef has been mentioned above.
Now Afsheen thought out a new plan, he wrote a confidential letter to
Mazyar the ruler of Tabristan, and instigated him to rise against
Abdullah bin Tahir. It read :
There is none to patronize and promote the Zoroastrian religion
except you and me. Babak tried to support it but he met his end due to
his own foolishness. He did not act upon my advice. Now there is still
a golden chance at present. You simply rise in revolt. They will only
send me to face you. Now I have a very powerful army. I shall
conspire with you· and we shall join forces. Then only the westerners,
Arabs and Khorasanis will fight against us. The westerners are very
few. An ordinary division of our army will be sufficient to face them.
As for the Arabs, give them a morsel and then pound their heads with
stones. As far as the Khorasanis are concerned, their enthusiasm is just

452

The History of Islam

like boiling milk it rises and then the next moment it falls . With a
small amount of determination, they will be finished quickly. If you
gear up a little then the religion, which saw its rise during the regimes
of the non-Arab kings, may again be established and promoted.
Mazyar was overjoyed reading the letter. He rose in revolt. He
collected taxes from his subjects for a year in advance, procured the
weapons of war, repaired the forts and was ready to face the most
powerful army. When Abdullah bin Tahir was informed of Mazyar's
revolt, he sent his own uncle Hasan bin Husain with an ari:ry towards
him. When Motasim found out, he issued orders for the dispatch of
armies from the capital and other places to reinforce Abdullah bin
Tahir. He did not allow Afsheen to go to the conflict. Consequently,
Mazyar was arrested and presented before Abdullah bin Tahir who in
turn sent him to Motasim. Motasim sent him to jail. When Hasan bin
Husain caught Mazyar, he seized Afsheen' s letter to him. Other letters
of the same nature sent by Afsheen were also recovered from him.
Abdullah bin Tahir sent those letters to Caliph Motasim, who took
and kept them under his custody and outwardly did not attach any
importance to them. This happened in 224 A.H.

The Revolt in Kurdistan
The revolt in Tabristan had hardly been stamped out when Jafar bin
Fahar, a Kurd, collected a huge number of Kurds in the adjoining
areas of Mousil and rose in revolt. Although its border touched the
borders of Azerbaijan and Armenia, Motasim sent Abdullah bin
Sayyed bin Anas to punish Jafar and did not send Afsheen on this
expedition. Abdullah bin Sayyed arrived there and marshaled his
troops in battle array. The battles continued until Motasim sent
another general Itakh with a strong army. Jafar bin Fahar was killed in
action and his men were caught and killed. This revolt probably
engineered by Afsheen ended in 225 A.H.

The Revolt in Armenia and Azerbaijan
After having made one of his relatives Mankajur his deputy and
having handed the governership of Azerbaijan over to him, Afsheen
settled in the capital. Mankajur somehow found a large treasure of

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

453

Babak Khurmi in a certain village. He did not inform the Caliph and
kept it himself. Motasim's informant told him. When Mankajur knew
of this, he decided to murder him. The poor reporter sought safety
from the people of Ardabil and they tried to stop Mankajur but he was
ready to kill them too. When informed, Motasim sent an order for
Mankajur's removal to Afsheen and dispatched Bagha Kabeer with an
army to Azerbaijan to take his place. When Mankajur heard that he
was deposed and that Bagha Kabeer was coming to take ch~_rge he
revolted. He left Ardabil fought and was defeated. Bagha Kabeer
moved forward and captured Ardabil. Mankajur fled and took refuge
in a fort in Azerbaijan. He remained there for about a month. Finally,
one of his own men captured him when he was off his guard and
handed him over to Bagha Kabeer. Bagha Kabeer returned to Samarra
with him and brought him to Caliph Motasim who put him in jail.

The Death of Afsheen
The above-mentioned incident strengthened Caliph Motasim' s
suspicion against Afsheen and he became sure of his involvement in
it. Afsheen also realized that the Caliph had become suspicions about
him. He therefore began to think of ways how to flee the capital. First,
he thought of going to Azerbaijan and Armenia and from there to his
native country Ashrosna via Khirz. However, he could not execute
this plan simply because Caliph Motasim had sent his deputy in
Mankajur' s place as Afsheen' s deputy and Afsheen knew that he
would not be safe in Azerbaijan.
At last, he made up his mind to host a feast for the Caliph, courtirs
and chiefs of the government. He wanted to keep them busy eating
and drinking for the whole day and when they went to sleep, he
would slip away. He had hardly decided on his final plan when by
chance he got angry with his servant who was also his confident and
abused him. The servant in retaliation went to ltakh and disclosed
Afsheen' s intentions to him. Itakh at once took the servant with him
and went to Caliph Motasim and informed him that Afsheen was
preparing to escape. Motasim called him at once, had him stripped of
rank and sent him to jail and did not show any concern about it. Then
he wrote to the governor of Khorasan, Abdullah bin Tahir to arrest

454

The History of Islam

and send Afsheen's son Hasan bin Afsheen who was the ruler of
Mawaraunnahr and was living in Ashrosna. Hasan bin Afsheen often
complained against the ruler of Bukhara, Nuh bin Asad. Abdullah bin
Tahir wrote to Hasan bin Ashfeen, "I hand over to you the rule of
Bukhara go to Bukhara, show this order of mine to Nuh bin Asad and
take charge of Bukhara." Hasan bin Afsheen was overjoyed at the
letter and immediately left for Bukhara. Abdullah bin Tahir had
already written to the ruler of Bukhara Nuh bin Asad, "I have sent
Hasan bin Afsheen to you on this pretext. Arrest him as soon as he
enters Bukhara and send him to me." By this ploy, he was arrested
and brought to Abdullah bin Tahir in Merv.
Abdullah bin Tahir sent him to Motasim. When Hasan bin Afsheen
was brought as a captive, Motasim commissioned a committee
comprised of his Prime Minister Mohammad bin Abdul Malik, Qadi
Ahmad bin Abi Dawood, Ishaq bin Ibrahim and other members of the
government and asked them to probe Afsheen's affairs and award
him the punishment which he deserved. Though Caliph Motasim
could have had him slain immediately, he took this very wise step in
order to counter act any possible move in the army against him for
killing Afsheen.
Motasim was perfectly aware of Afsheen' s evil designs and he had
come to know during the war against Babak that he was stealing and
sending the stolen royal goods to his son who he had already
appointed the ruler of his native land Ashrosna. Since Afsheen was at
war with an enemy who had not been able to be subdued for 20 years,
Motasim remained patient. The success of the expedition against
Babak was no ordinary feat and to keep Afsheen deprived of reward
and take him to task for his betrayal might have proved fatal to
Motasim and no power on the earth could have saved him from the
anger of his military. Furthermore; Afsheen was expected to undergo
a real change for the better but when his letters a"nd policy proved him
a traitor, Motasim was justified in what he did.
The commission of the Prime Minister and other leaders began the
hearing and investigating Afsheen's case very carefully and
methodically. He was brought daily to the court and statements of
witnesses and documentary proof were presented in his presence.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

455

Mazyar who was still in jail was brought before Afsheen. Afsheen's
letters were read and shown to Afsheen. Afsheen pleaded guilty.
Mazyar also spoke plainly and stated the facts clearly. Then things
about Afsheen's denial of Islam came under discussion, which proved
Afsheen a hypocrite. He desecrated the Qur'an, the mosques and the
Imams of the mosques, he had the Zoroastrian books recited daily and
kept them with him all the time, insolence against Islam and the
Prophet Mohammad ~ while offering prayer with the Muslims and
practicing all the tenets of Islam outwardly. In short, it was proved
solidly, absolutely and convincingly that Afsheen was not a Muslim at
heart rather he was engaged in defrauding the Muslims, bringing
about the overthrow of the government and ending the Islamic
government and establishing a Zoroastrian kingdom. The hearing of
this case closed peacefully and the final verdict was this that Mazyar
should be given 400 lashes and Afsheen was given capital
punishment. Mazyar could not bear 400 lashes and he died. Afsheen
was sent to the gallows and his dead body was put on public display.
This took place in Shaban 226 A.H. Ishaq bin Yahya bin Mu'az took
over as the Commander-in-chief in place of Afsheen.

The Death of Motasim
After ending the threat from Afsheen, Caliph Motasirn Billah
surveyed the borders of his occupied territories. When · he was
satisfied that there was no danger of any unrest or revolt, he said,
"While Banu Umayyah were rulers and Caliphs, we did not get
anything from their kingship and power. However, when we received
the Caliphate, Banu Umayyah's kingdom and government continued
in Andalus. Therefore, we should move towards the west and take
Andalus from Banu Umayyah." He had his treasury, war and
traveling expenses estimated and began to prepare to invade Andalus.
During that period, he was informed that Abu Harb Yemeni who
lived in Palestine and claimed to belong to the dynasty of Banu
Urnayyah, had collected a 100,000 man army and was about to revolt.
As stated, Abu Harb lived in Palestine. One day when he was out, a
soldier came to his house and stayed there. The women folk forbade
him to do so. The soldier beat them up and occupied the outer part of

i;

456

The History of Islam

the house meant for male guests by force . When Abu Harb came back,
he attacked the soldier and killed him. Out of fear of the officials, he
went to hide in the mountains of Jordan. He wore a veil over his face
and began to preach to the local people. They became his devotees. He
started criticizing and speaking ill of the Caliph. In this way, about
lOD.,000 people became his disciples, collected under his banner and
were ready to rebel against the Caliph. Motasim deputed Raja bin
Ayyub with 1,000 soldiers to punish him. But Raja bin Ayyub was
overawed by the greater number of Abu Harb' s followers and
hesitated in waging the battle. He decided to wait for the planting
season, letting Abu Harb's followers who were mostly farmers,
become busy with their agricultural activities, before attacking.
During this time, Caliph Motasim Billah died on 30 Rabi-al-Awwal
227 A.H. and his trial of strength against Banu Umayyah remained
unfulfilled . After his death, his son Wathiq Billah became Caliph and
the people took the oath at his hands. Wathiq led Motasim' s burial
service and he was buried at Samarra.

The Characteristics of Motasim's Caliphate
As Caliph Motasim himself was not an educated man, the academic
activities, which began during Haroon'.s rule and reached their
pinnacle under Mamoon's regime, dwindled . Motasim was interested
more in war and conquest. During his regime, territories of Rome,
Khizr (the area north of the Black Sea), Mawaraunnahr, Kabul and
Sistan were conquered. He fought the Roman emperor very hard and
surpassed any previous successes by Muslim forces against the
Romans. The killing of 30,000 and capturing an equal number of
Romans, in the conquest of Amurya, made the Romans extremely
terrified of Motasim. The number of kings who assembled at
Motasim's door had never been seen assembling at any other Caliph's
door. Motasim was also fond of constructing buildings. The daily
expenses of his kitchen were 1,000 dinars.
He purchased many Turk slaves and increased their number. He made
a few select Turk slaves his commanders and generals. During his
regime, the Turks progressed, rapidly, became cultured and brave and
began to exhibit valor. By increasing the Turk armies and letting them

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

457

progress he wanted to break the power of the Khorasanis who had
earlier reduced and ruined the Arab power. These same Turks later on
would be responsible for the ruin of the Abbasi Caliphate. Motasim
committed an error in making a third nation powerful. He should have
helped the Arabs to be a match for the Khorasanis. However, since his
ancestors from · the very beginning of their rule regarded the Arabs as
their enemie~ and relied more on the Khorasanis and distrusted the
Arabs he dared not disturb this age-old family tradition.
Motasim had heard about the Khorasani's rebellions and conspiracies
and knew how his forefathers had faced their intrigues repeatedly. He
also knew that his family's old rivals, the Alawiites, commanded
respect and popularity among the Khorasanis and the Arabs and used
their support against him. Therefore, Motasim made a third nation
powerful, which had not been influenced by the Alawiites. This third
nation, the Turks, had not yet grown intimate and attached to Islam
due to their ignorance and barbarism. Though the Turks had been made
subservient and subdued for some time, Islam was not preached to
them as it should have been. Another reason was that only Turk chiefs
ruled over the Turk territories of Mawaraunnahr (present day
Uzbekistan) and they paid taxes to the Islamic governments.
When these Turk converts made sudden progress and saw that they
were themselves a powerful Islamic force they started dreaming about
putting an end to the Abbasid Caliphate as is evident from Afsheen's
case.
Although Caliph Motasim was uneducated, he was wise. He
recruited the Turks into the armed forces by empowering them yet
he retained the ability to neutralize the dangers in this strategy.
Therefore, they were not able to harm the Islamic government as
long as he lived. Had his successors been as capable as he was or
had he ruled for a longer period, the flaws that developed later on
might have been corrected.
Truly, these are only speculations after the fact and not the most
fundamental factors in the condition of the Caliphate. The real and the
grossest error was the Muslims had accorded recognition to the reign
of succession in the Islamic Caliphate and the son was entitled to

l

, 1

458

The History of Islam

succeed his father as Caliph. This sinful practice has always inflicted
great harm on Islamic rule and the Muslims. Forgetting the tradition
of Abu Bakr ~ and Omar bin Khattab ~ led them to see these
unfortunate days . .:., __,..,,.1J .,i, 1,;1J .1 1,;1
It is from Motasim's Caliphate that the Turks political life cycle starts.
Motasim may also be called the Caliph with a connection to the number
8. He was the 8th child of Caliph Haroon Rasheed. He was born in 180
A.H. or according to another tradition in 178 A.H. In both these years,
the digit 8 is present. He sat on the throne in 218 A.H. Motasim was the
8th Caliph of the Abbasids. He lived for 48 years. He had 8 sons and 8
daughters. His birth constellation was Scorpio, the eighth sign of the
zodiac. He was Caliph for 8 years, 8 months and 8 days. He had 8
palaces constructed. He won 8 major battles. 8 kings were brought to his
court. He had 8 formidable enemies killed, like Afsheen, Ajeef, Abbas,
Babak, and Mazyar. He left 800,000 dinars, 800,000 dirhams, 8 thousand
horses, 8 thousand slaves and 8 thousand slave-girls as his legacy. He
died on the 8 th day in the month of Rabia Awwal.
Like Mamoon Rasheed, he was also obsessed with the question of the
Quran' s creation and most of the scholars were hurt due to his
preoccupation with this obscure philosophical point. Had he not
suffered from this shortcoming he would have been called the greatest
Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty. During his regime, the glory of the
Abbasid Caliphate reached its zenith following which signs of decline
began to be visible.

bin Mahdi bin Mansoor Abbasi was Abu }afar or Abu! Qasim. His real
name was Haroon. He was born of Qaratees, a slave girl, on the way
to Makkah on 20 Shaban 196 A.H. His father made him his heirapparent. He sat on the throne after his death. He was very handsome
and fair complexioned. His beard was thick and shapely. His fair
complexion was combined with paleness. There was a visible black
mole in the white of his eyes. He was a great poet and literary expert.
He was as efficient in Arabic literature as Mamoon to a certain extent

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

459

superior to him. But he was inferior to him in philosophy, practical
skills and wisdom. He had seen academic symposia and seminars
during Mamoon's regime. He had a taste for knowledge and he was
called Mamoon junior or Mamoon the second .
Wathiq had committed to memory so many verses that none
among the Abbasid Caliphs could match him in this respect. He
was fond of eating and drinking like his father. He was a
voracious eater. He used to give away big prizes and
remunerations to poets and literary men. He honored men of
letters and thought it essential to treat them respectfully.
However, he inherited the craze about the issue of the Quran and
the created or uncreated word of Allah from his father and he was
so over ambitious in this respect that he killed great scholars with
his own hands thinking it to be a virtuous act.
In the last phase of his life, a remarkable thing happened which led
him to reduce or totally stop his activities about the Quran and its
creation. Abu Abdur Rahman Abdullah bin Muhammad Azdi who
was Imam Abu Dawood and Nasai' s teacher was brought to the
court as a captive for his disbelief in the issue of the Quran and its
creation. He put a question to Qadi Ahmad bin Abi Dawood who
had been enjoying a status equivalent to that of the Prime Minister
in the court since Motasim's time and believed in the issue of the
Quran and its creation: "Please tell me whether the Prophet ~ knew
or did not know that the Qur' an is a creation."
Qadi Ahmad said: " Yes. He ~ knew it." Abu Abdur Rahman said:
"Did the Prophet
give any instructions to the people regarding the
belief of the Qur'an to be a creation?" Qadi Ahmad said: "The Prophet
~ did not say anything about it." Then Abu Abdur Rahman said,
"This information the Prophet ~ did not teach the people and did not
force them to believe in despite his knowledge of it, so then why don't
you take the people's reticence as sufficient and why do you force
them to accept it?" Wathiq was startled hearing this, stood up, left the
court and went to his chamber in the palace and lay down on his bed.
He kept repeating, "We are adopting stern measures regarding an
issue about which the Prophet ~ kept silent." He then ordered Abu
Abdur Rahman to be released and sent him to his native country
comfortably with 300 red dinars as a reward.

The History of Islam

-------------------Abu Harb and the Natives of Damascus

While discussing Caliph Motasim, it has been stated above that
Motasim had sent Raja bin Ayyub to punish Abu Harb Yemeni. After
waiting for a few days, he started a series of battles with Abu Harb. In
the meantime, Motasim Billah died and Wathiq Billah succeeded to
the throne. As soon as the natives of Damascus heard about his death,
they rebelled. They besieged their governor within the Governor's
headquarters and were collecting and arraying soldiers and had
gathered a big army.
As soon as Wathiq heard the news, he ordered Raja bin Ayyub to
control Damascus first. At that time, he was at war with Abu Harb at
Ramla. In order to comply with this order, he left a very small army
behind and taking the rest of the army with him proceeded towards
Damascus. The natives of Damascus fought a bloody battle with him
in which 1,500 natives of Damascus and 300 of Raja' s soldiers were
killed. After having been defeated, the natives of Damascus begged
for security and peace and the rebellion endep. After Damascus Raja
went towards Ramla, defeated Abu Harb and took him captive. Abu
Harb lost 20,000 men in this battle.

The Rise and Fall of Ashnas
Following his succession to the throne Wathiq Billah mad e the Turk
slave, Ashnas his deputy with total executive powers over all the
Islamic territories. Prime Minister Mohammad bin Abdul Malik bin
Zayyat who had been at this post since Motasim's times continued to
enjoy this status even during Wathiq's regime. The post, which wa
given to Ashnas, was called Deputy of the Dynasty it was created b
Wathiq Billah for the first time.
The Deputy of the Dynasty used all powers of the Caliph and was o
higher rank than the Prime Minister. No other CalipJ:l invested anybod
with so much power before this time. Though the Turks had suffered
loss following Afsheen's death, his forces, platoons and cavalries stil
survived and enjoyed honor as usual. When Ashnas came into ful
power over the entire Islamic world following Wathiq Billah'

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

461

succession to the throne, it marks the establishment of Turk rule in the
world of Islam. However, Ashnas did not enjoy this power long and his
powers were limited very soon. However, this precedent would prove
to be responsible for the downfall and ruin of the Abbasid Caliphate.
Wathiq Billah was fond of academic symposiums he used to sit with
the scholars, the members of the government and listened to academic
debates and ancient traditions. Most of the scholars were Arabs and
they narrated the events of Haroon Rasheed' s times whenever they
had a chance. They narrated to Wathiq Billah stories of the Barmuk's
academic tastes and their generosity along with their power and
influence and then details of their conspiracies against the dynasty of
the Caliph and all the events that led to their ruin in a proper and
effective manner. Consequently, his eyes opened a bit and he began to
put the Turks and Khorasani chiefs under surveillance. Most of them
were found to be involved in misappropriation and Wathiq Billah
started the process of collecting fines from them. It was in this
connection that Ashnas' s powers were restricted. He died in 230 A.H.

The End of Arab Dignity
Until this point, the Abbasid dynasty had been reducing the
leadership roles and positions of honor of the Arabs and the nonArabs had been continuously improving their positions. Because of
being the cradle of Islam, Arabia commanded a special respect and
because the Arabs were the first servants of Islam, there was a special
reverence for them. The dynasty of the Caliph itself came from an
Arab family. That was why the non-Arabs never wished to humiliate
the Arabs nor did the Caliphs send Khorasani and Turk armies to the
Hijaz and Yemen to punish the Arab tribes. Whenever there arose any
need for making arrangements for maintaining the administration of
the Arab provinces, Arab, Iraqi or Syrian soldiers were sent.
The consequence of this special reverence was that though the Arabs
were weakened, every heart harbored honor for them. No one
questioned the dignity of the Arabs. During Caliph Wathiq's regime
the Arabs lost this special acknowledgement. The details in brief are
that there lived a good number of people belonging to the tribe of
Banu Sulaim in the adjoining regions of Madinah. They attacked Banu
Kanana and looted their goods.

462

The History of Islam

Such incidents of lootings and killings began among the Arabs simply
because they were dismissed from serving in the conquering armies
and the Abbasid Caliphs had gradually eliminated them from the
military. In this situation, the fighting instincts of the Arabs began to
be channeled into looting, plundering and robbing.
When the ruler of Madinah, Mohammad bin Saleh, heard of Banu
Sulaim' s excesses he sent an army to punish and discipline them. The
army suffered a crushing defeat at their hands leading to the spread of
anarchy in all the regions lying between Makkah and Madinah and
bringing to an abrupt halt the movement of caravans. When Caliph
Wathiq Billah received the news, he sent his Turk commander Bagha
Kabeer with an army to the Hijaz. He reached Madinah in Shaban 230
A.H . and confrontations with Banu Sulaim took place. He defeated the
Banu Sulaim. He arrested 1,000 of them, imprisoned them in Madinah
and killed many of them.
Bagha Kabeer along with his Turk army stayed in Madinah for
about four months and continued to humiliate, subdue and terrify
the Arab tribes in various ways. After the Hajj, Bagha Kabeer turned
to Banu Hila), punished them like he had punished Banu Sulaim and
arrested 300 men. Then he turned to Banu Murrah. He went to
Fadak and encamped there for 40 days and captured many men of
Banu Fazarah and Banu Murrah and imprisoned them in Madinah.
Then he called the chiefs and headmen of Banu Ghaffar, Thalbah
and Ashja and took from them the oath of allegiance. Then he
arrested 3,000 men of Banu Kilab released 2,000 of them and
imprisoned 1,000 of them. Then he went to Yamamah, killed 50 men
of Banu Numer and imprisoned 40.
The inhabitants of Yamamah began to fight against Bagha Kabeer he
killed 1,500 of them in several encounters and skirmishes. The flame
of fighting had hardly dimmed when Wathig Billah sent another Turk
commander with a fresh army to reinforce him. Bagha Kabeer then
ordered a general massacre all over Yamamah. When they fled, he
pursued them until Yemen and killed thousands of them. In short,
after badly mauling and humiliating the Arab tribes he arrested 2,000
Arab noble men and brought them to Baghdad.
After arriving in Baghdad, he wrote to Mohammad bin Saleh to bring

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

463

all the captives he had put in jail in Madinah to Baghdad. He gathered
all the prisoners he had captured on the expedition and brought all of
them to Baghdad where they were put in jail. In this way, Bagha
Kabeer had the Arabs killed mercilessly and humiliated and subdued
in various ways by Turks over a two-year period.
Abdullah bin Tahir, the ruler of Khorasan, died in 230 A.H. Caliph
Wathiq Billah retained Tahir's son as the ruler of Khorasan, Kerman,
Tabristan and Rayy in accordance with Abdullah bin Tahir's will

Ahmad bin Nasr' s Revolt and Death
Ahmad bin Nasr bin Malik bin Haitham Khazai's grand father Malik
bin Khazai was one of the deputies of the propagation of the Abbasids
cause. Ahmed bin Nasr used to live in the company of the scholars of
Hadith and was counted among them. He was opposed to the issue of
the Quran's creation that was why a large group of people took the
oath at his hands against the Caliphate of the Abbasids. He revolted
in Baghdad on Wednesday night 3 Shaban 231 A.H. and beat the
war drums. The Baghdad Police swung into action and arrested him
very tactfully.
Ahmad bin Nasr and his men were sent to Wathiq Billah as captives.
Wathiq killed Nasr with his own hands. He cut of his head and sent
his body to Baghdad. The body was hung on the gate of Baghdad
and his head on the clock tower of Baghdad . A special guard was
deputed with instructions that he should not let the face be pointed
towards the Qiblah (direction of prayer). A sign was hung from his
ear with the words: "This is Ahmad bin Nasr bin Malik's head
whom the Caliph invited to accept the faith of Qur'an's creation but
he declined. Then Allah quickly invited him to the fire of Hell."
Ahmad bin Nasr's murder took place earlier than Abu Abdur
Rahman Abdullah bin Mohammad Azdi's experience with the
Caliph, which has been mentioned above.

The Exchange Prisoners of War with the Romans
The chain of battles with the Romans had been going on continuously.
The Muslims continued to defeat the Romans and at times, they

464

The History of Islam

reached Constantinople. However, the Roman Empire could not be
destroyed. During the period of the rightly guided Caliphs, the
Iranian empire was totally annihilated but the Roman Empire
survived. Although Syria, Palestine, and Egypt were taken from the
Romans and no stone was left unturned by the Muslims to capture
Constantinople and enter Europe, civil wars among the Muslims started
and Constantinople and Europe were spared from being overrun by
the hooves of the Muslims' horses. The series of these internal
struggles continued in such a way that they did not appear to have an
end and none of the Caliphs had a chance and the time necessary to
concentrate all their power on Europe nor was any of them able to
stop the rebellions and uprisings in the Islamic territories.
In short, the internal bickering of the Muslims saved the Roman
Emperor in Constantinople and the other European countries. The
skirmishes between the Muslims and the Christians along the
borders continued. Sometimes a Caliph invaded the Romans and
returned to the capital after threatening and punishing them but it
was never possible for him to be away from his capital for an
extended period of time. Even during Wathiq Billah's regime
skirmishes with the Romans went on . During Caliph Haroon
Rasheed's time, the exchange of the Christian and Muslim prisoners
took place twice. The exchange had taken place on the bank of the
river Lams and on 10 Muharram 231 A.H. during Wathiq Billah's
regime it took place there for a third time. The procedure adopted
was as follows: Two bridges across the river were constructed in
parallel. On one bridge, the Christian prisoners crossed over and on
the other bridge the Muslim prisoners crossed from the other side.
This was done to insure that the number of Muslims released
equaled the number of Christians released. Wathiq Billah sent
Khaqan on his behalf to the riverbank along with the Christian
prisoners. When an equal number of prisoners were exchanged and
all the Muslim prisoners numbering 4,600 were released, there still
remained many Roman prisoners in the Muslims custody.
Saying, "In this exchange we should have the upper hand and this is a
type of obligation on the Romans from us," Khaqan then set the
remaining Roman prisoners free.

465

The death of Wathiq Billah
Wathiq Billah came to suffer from dropsy. His whole body swelled up.
He was made to sit on a hot oven. This improved his condition. The next
day the oven was heated a bit more and he sat for a longer period,
which caused fever. They took him out and put him on a litter for a tour.
When it was put down, they found him dead. Immediately members of
the government Qadi Ahmad bin Dawood, Muhammad bin Abdul
Malik Prime Minister ltakh, Waseef and Umar bin Farah assembled at
the Caliph's palace and decided to enthrone Mohammad bin Wathiq
Billah, a young boy of 9 years. At that moment Waseef addressed them
saying, "Don't you fear Allah making such a young boy Caliph?"
Hearing these words, they realized their mistake. They stopped and
began to discuss who was the most deserving man. At last, Wathiq
Billah' s brother Jafar bin Motasim was called made to put on the royal
robe and sit on the throne of the Caliphate. He was given the title
Motawakkil Alallah, Motawakkil Alallah took the oath for Caliphate
from all, led the funeral prayer and ordered the burial.
Wathiq Billah was buried in Hadi palace. He ruled for 5 years and 9
months. He died on Tuesday 24 Thul Hijjah 232 A.H. at the age of 36.
He was very firm and forbearing. However, he committed excesses
regarding the issue of the Qur'an's creation. He was cured of this
craze at the end of his life.
Note: Caliph Wathiq's body was left alone after death and everyone
was busy taking the oath from Motawakkil Alallah's hands while an
animal came ate his eyes out of his head.

Motawakkil Atallah
Motawakkil Alallah bin Motasim Billah bin Haroon Rasheed' s real
name was Jafar. His kunya was Abul Fad!. He was born of a slave-girl
named Shuja. He ascended the throne after Wathiq's death on 24 Thul
Hijjah 232 A.H. Immediately after becoming Caliph he disbursed
salaries for 8 months to the army and made his son Muntasir the ruler
of Hijaz, Yemen and Taif.

466

The History of Islam

Mohammad bin Abdul Malik's Deposition and Death
Mohammad bin Abdul Malik Zayyat had been Prime Minister since
Motasim's times. Even during Wathiq Billah's regime, he continued in
that post. During Motawakkil Alallah's Caliphate, he remained Prime
Minister and tl:\en he was deposed and punished.
The following are the details: During his Caliphate, Wathiq Billah was
displeased with his brother Motawakkil Alallah. Motawakkil Alallah
went to Prime Minister Mohammad bin Abdul Malik and requested
him to recommend him to the Amir al-Muminin and improve his
standing with him. Due to his long term of office, the Prime Minister he
had grown a bit arrogant, ill tempered and unbalanced. He paid little
attention to Motawakkil Alallah and treated him discourteously and
said to him "Mend your ways and the Amir al-Muminin will
automatically be pleased with you and no recommendation is needed."
After that, he complained to Wathiq Billah against him saying, " He
came to me for a recommendation to you. When I saw his hair growing
like a woman, I did not talk to him." Wathiq called Motawakkil Alallah
to the court, had his hair cut and turned him out of the court. The
engineer of this humiliation was Mohammad bin Abdul Malik,
Motawakkil Alallah after two months of his assuming power, ordered
Itakh to arrest Mohammad bin Abdul Malik at home and send the
message to all the occupied countries that all his property and goods
wherever they were should be confiscated. In compliance with the
order, Itakh imprisoned him, had his goods brought to Baghdad and
deposited them in the royal treasury. Mohammad bin Abdul Malik
could not stand the rigors of captivity and died on 15 Rabi-al-Awwal
233 A.H. in that state. Omar bin Farah was also arrested and imprisoned
like him in Ramadan 233 A.H. but was later released on payment of
1,100,000 dirhams.

ltakh's arrest and death
Itakh was a Turk slave. In his early years, he lived with Salam bin
Abras and served as a cook and that is why he was known as Itakh
Tabbakh (the cook). Finding him wise, well-mannered, strong-bodied
and handsome Caliph Motasim purchased him from Salam Abras in

199 A.H. As he was discerning and clever, he kept rising in rank. During
Motasim' s regime, his respect and power increased many fold. Those
from the royal family accused of a crime were generally imprisoned in
his house and put under his surveillance. Ajeef, Mamoon Rasheed' s
descendants, Mohammad bin Abdul Malik and Omar bin Farah were
kept as prisoners and killed under his charge. He was also in charge of
defense, surveillance and delegations. He left for Hajj in Dhul Qadah
234 A.H. After his departure, Motawakkil appointed his servant Waseef
to the post of surveillance. When he returned from Hajj and reached
near Baghdad, lshaq bin Ibrahim at the insistence of Caliph Motawakkil
invited him to Baghdad and then imprisoned him along with his two
sons, Mansoor and Mozaffar. ltakh died in captivity and his two sons
remained in prison until the end of Motawakkil' s Caliphate. When
Muntasir ascended the throne, he released them.

The Oath for Succession
ln 235 A.H., Mohammad bin Bayee bin Jalees revolted in Azerbaijan
however, it was soon crushed by Bagha Kabeer. The same year Caliph
Motawakkil took the oath from the people for the succession of his
sons Mohammad, Talha and Ibrahim and declared that first
Mohammad would be the Caliph followed by Talha. He gave titles of
Muntasir and Motaz to Mohammad and Talha respectively. The
western countries were given to Mohammad and the eastern countries
to Motaz as landed estates. Later on, they were made successors to the
throne and Syria was given to them as a landed estate.
The same year, Caliph Motawakkil changed the uniforms of the army
and woolen coats were ordered to be used by tying them with a cord
instead of the belt used formerly. The Dhimmis were restrained from
constructing new places of worship. Instructions were issued in all the
territories that no one should approach any government officials for
financial help. The Christian Dhimmis were ordered not to hang the
cross at their conferences. The same year Hasan bin Saha! and Ishaq
bin Ibrahim bin Hasan bin Mus' ab, the nephew of Tahir bin Husain
who had been the Baghdad Chief of Police since Mamoon Rasheed's
regime died . Motawakkil made Mohammad bin Ishaq the Chief of
Police. He gave him the governorship of the province of Iran. It should
be kept in mind that the Province of Iran was separate from Khorasan.

468

The History of Islam

The governership of Khorasan along with that of Tabristan was under
the control of Tahir bin Abdullah Tahir bin Husain. The same year
Caliph Motawakkil issued the decree that all the Christians should wear
a scarf. The necktie is probably the memorial of this. In 236 A.H., he
restrained the people from visiting the grave of Imam Husain ~ and the
constructions around it were demolished. The same year Obaidullah bin
Yahya bin Khaqan was given the post of the Prime Minister.

Revolt in Armenia
The province of Armenia was governed by Yusuf bin Mohammad.
Buqra bin Aswat, a prelate and the head of the prelates visited the
governor's headquarters and begged Yusuf bin Mohammad for
security. Yusuf arrested him along with his sons and sent them to
Caliph Motawakkil. This caused great resentment among the prelates
of Armenia against Yusuf. Buqrat bin Aswat's son-in-law Musa bin
Zurara assembled them and sought their opinions. All swore that they
would kill Yusuf bin Mohammad. Then under Musa bin Zurara's
command, the Christians revolted. Yusuf bin Mohammad came out to
fight. The rebels killed him and his men in Ramadan 237 A.H. Hearing
this news, Motawakkil sent Bagha Kabeer to Armenia. Bagha Kabeer
passed through Mousil and Jazirah, encamped at Arzan and
conquered it. He killed 30,000 of Musa bin Zurara's men and also
captured a large number. After that in 238 A.H., he picked up the
rebellious prelates, punished them and sent them to Baghdad.

Qadi Ahmad bin Abi Dawood's Deposition and Death
Qadi Ahmad bin Abi Dawood commanded greater influence and
power than the Prime Minister during Wathiq Billah' s regime. The
status quo was maintained during the initial period of Motawakkil.
Caliph Motawakkil became displeased with Qadi Ahmad bin Dawood
in 237 A.H. and ordered the confiscation of his goods, property and
estates. Qadi Ahmad's son Abul Waleed sold his goods and property
for 160,000 dirhams and presented the same to the Caliph.
Motawakkil deposed and jailed Qadi Ahmad and gave the post of
Chief Justice to Yahya bin Aktham.
Qadi Anmad suffered from paralysis at that time. Qadi Yahya bin

The Caliphate ifthe A bbas1ds (Second Phase)

469

Aktham was also dismissed by Motawakkil in 240 A.H. and Ahmad
bin Abi Dawood died the same year 237 A.H. 20 days after his son
Abu] Waleed's death. The same year the Christians in Hims took up
arms, removed their ruler and captured the city. Caliph Motawakkil
ordered the armies of Damascus and Ramla to move on Hims. These
armies quelled the rebellion of the Christians and they exiled many of
them. The same year Motawakkil dismissed Qadi Abu Bakr bin
Mohammad bin Abul Laith of Egypt and had him lashed. He
appointed Imam Malik's disciple Harith bin Miskeen as Chief Justice
of Egypt. Then the Caliph made Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir
bin Husain bin Mus'ab Chief of the Baghdad Police while his brother
Tahir bin Abdullah bin Tahir was made the governor of Khorasan.

The Roman Invasion
In 238 A.H. the governor of Egypt Ambasa bin Ishaq, called the army
stationed along the coast of Dimyat to Egypt for some engagement.
Finding the place unprotected, the Romans with a fleet of 100 ships
looted Dimyat completely. They burned down the Central Mosque,
looted the city's goods and put captives on their ships and sailed to
Tunis. They repeated the same there also. Ali bin Yahya Armini
invaded the Roman Empire with the help of the army of Saifah and
captured many Christians. In 241 A.H., the Roman empress Nadurah
wanted to convert the Muslim captives to Christianity. Those who
refused were killed. Many converted to Christianity out of fear of death.
Then the Queen requested Motawakkil to exchange the prisoners.
Motawakkil sent his servant Saif with the Qadi of Baghdad Jafar bin
Abdul Wahid to accompany the Christian prisoners. The exchange of
the Muslim and Christian prisoners took place at the river Lams.

Invasion on the Roman Empire
After the above exchange of prisoners the Romans again committed a
breach of treaty. They led a surprise attack and took away many
Muslims as captives. The Muslim commanders chased the Romans
but returned disappointed.
Caliph Motawakkil sent Ali bin Yahya along with the army of Saifa to
declare Jihad on the Roman Empire. The Caliph left the capital and

470

The History of Islam

went to Damascus. He encamped there and was busy sending armies
against the Romans and making the expedi tion a success. All
members of the government accompanied the Caliph to Damascus.
All the royal offices were also shifted there because the Caliph was
inclined to stay there permanently.
Hardly two months had passed since the Caliph's arrival in Damascus
when an epidemic broke out and he had to return to the capital.
Before leaving, he sent a big army under Bagha Kabeer's command to
attack the Roman Empire. Bagha Kabeer entered Roman territory and
ordered a general massacre. He conquered many forts and did not
hesitate killing and capturing the Romans.
When the Romans surrendered and begged for amnesty, Bagha
Kabeer pulled back at the Caliph's instance. The Romans violated the
agreement again in 245 A.H. and they looted some Muslim cities. Ali
bin Yahya attacked the Romans in retaliation, and looted them
significantly. In 246 A.H., the Romans again harassed the Muslims.
They looted the border territories and desolated them. This time
Caliph Motawakkil deputed land and navy forces to lead a multipronged attack on the Roman territories. This caused a major
upheaval there. The Romans again begged for amnesty and expressed
their will for reconciliation. The Muslims conceded to it willingly and
again prisoners were exchanged at the Lams River. This time, in 246
A.H., 2,300 Muslim prisoners were recovered.

The Building of the City of )afaria
In 245 A.H., Motawakkil had a new city named Jafaria built at the cost
of 200,000 dinars not including a big palace in the center of the city
called Luloo (pearl) . It was taller than all the royal palaces. Some
called it Jafaria, some Motawakkilia and yet some Makhoorah. Jafar
bin Khayyat died the same year. In this year, Motawakkil had Najah
bin Maslama beaten to death. He was a very influential man. He was
the executive of the office of Motawakkil's official proclamations.
The charge of bribery was proved against him and he suffered this
severe punishment.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

471

The Murder of Motawakkil
As has been mentioned above, Motawakkil had made his son Muntasir
heir apparent. Muntasir was greatly influenced by the Shiites and
believed in the creation of the Quran as did Wathiq and Motasim before
him. But Motawakkil was a strict follower of Sunnah, a great adviser of
the scholars of the Sunnah and a formidable critic on the issue of the
Qur' an' s creation. He always remained engaged in putting an end to
this problem with great courage. This difference of belief between the
father and the son led to an estrangement. Motawakkil made up his
mind to make his second son Motaz his heir-apparent. As Muntasir and
Motaz were born of two different women, there already existed a rivalry
between them. When Caliph Motawakkil preferred Motaz to Muntasir,
the latter turned inimical to his father.
A few days before this Caliph Motawakkil had become angry with his
Turk commanders Bagha Kabeer, Waseef Kabeer, Waseef Sagheer and
Dawajan Ashrosani for some of their activities and seized their estates,
the Turks were displeased with him. Though Bagha Kabeer was sent
to the Roman territories, his son Musa bin Bagha was assigned to
protect the royal palace.
When Bagha Kabeer found that Muntasir agreed to his views, he
organized a group including his four sons and a few Turks and assigned
them the task of murdering Motawakkil. One night when Muntasir and
the other courtiers left the court and the Caliph remained with Fatah bin
Khaqan and four other companions, the killers entered the royal palace
by the door facing the Tigris River and attacked the Caliph. Fatah bin
Khaqan was also killed with him. Leaving the two dead bodies, the
killers with their blood-stained swords reached Mw1tasir the same night
and congratulated him on becoming the Caliph. Muntasir immediately
went to the royal palace and took the oath from the people. Waseef and
other Turk chiefs came and took the oath. When this news reached the
minister Obaidullah bin Yahya bin Khaqan, he rushed to Motaz but
Muntasir had already called Motaz to him and taken the oath from
him. When the minister Obaidullah called on Motaz, 10,000 people
including Azdi, Armeni and non-Arabs assembled there. They said to

472

History of [slam

him in one voice, "If you permit us, we shall kill Muntasir and his
men." Obaidullah stopped them. The next morning Muntasir ordered
Motawakkil and Fatah to be buried. This happened on 4 Shawwal 247
A.H. Caliph Motawakkil was murdered after being Caliphate for 14
years 10 months and 3 days. He was 40.

Motawakkil's Habits and Nature and a Few Important
Incidents
Immediately after assuming power, Caliph Motawakkil Alallah
showed his interest and inclination towards the revival of the Sunnah.
In 234 A.H., he invited all the scholars of Hadith to the capital
Samarra and accorded them great honor. Before this during Wathiq
and Motasim's regimes, they could not deliver lectures on Hadith in
public and could not narrate Hadith regarding the vision of Allah.
Motawakkil decreed them to teach Hadith at mosques freely and
narrate Hadith about the attributes and vision of Allah. This pleased
the Muslims and endeared him to them. Lessons on Hadiths began to
be taught at the mosques. He put an end to the practice of grave
worship. This made the Shiites his enemies because the rites
performed at the grave of Imam Husain ~ were stopped at once.
In 240 A.H., the inhabitants of Khalat heard such a loud sound from
the sky that many people died from its impact. Hailstones, the size
of chicken eggs, fell in Iraq and 13 villages sank into the earth . In 243
A.H., a severe tremor was felt in North Africa, Khorasan, Tabristan
and Isfahan. Many mountains cracked and large numbers of people
fell into the earth. Stones weighing 5 kg. fell on an Egyptian village.
In Ramadan 243 A.H., the people of Ha lab (Aleppo) saw and heard
a bird uttering, "O people fear Allah" followed by" Allah!" "Allah"
40 times. Then it flew away. The next day the same thing happened.
They informed the people in the capital and 500 people witnessed it.
In 245 A.H., earthquakes took place in the whole world; many cities
and forts fell to the ground; a mountain in Antakia fell into the
ocean; the water in the springs of Makkah disappeared. Motawakkil
spent 1,000,000 dinars to bring water from Arafat. Terrible sounds
from the sky were heard.

Motawakkil was very generous. He gave more awards to the poets
than any other Caliph had ever given. It was during his regime that
Dhun Nun Misri appeared. When the Egyptian governor called on
Thul Nun Misri and enquired about his faith, he was satisfied and
wrote accordingly to Motawakkil. Motawakkil called him to the
capital and was very pleased with him. He respected him much. After
Motawakkil's murder somebody saw him in a dream and asked,
"What has Allah done with you?" Motawakkil said," Allah forgave
me for whatever little I could do for the revival of the Sunnah." When
he ascended the throne, the people thought about a suitable title for
him. There was no agreement on it but when Motawakkil narrated his
dream, all of them liked the title Motawakkil Alallah.'
Once Motawakkil called the scholars to his palace including Ahmad
bin Mada!. When all the scholars had arrived, Motawakkil also came,
seeing him approaching all the scholars stood up to show respect
except Ahmad bin Mada! who remained sitting. Motawakkil said to
his minister Obaidullah "Has this gentlemen not taken the oath?"
Obaidullah said, "He has taken the oath but his eyesight is poor."
Ahmed bin Madal at once said, "There is no defect in my eyes but I
want to protect you from Allah' s punishment for a Hadith says:
'Whosoever expects that people should stand up respect him he
should make his accommodation in Hell."' Hearing this Motawakkil
moved near Ahmad bin Madal.
Yazid Mahlabi says: One day Motawakkil said to me, "The Caliphs
were strict with their subjects in order to keep them in awe . But l
treat my subjects kindly so that they may obey me by recognizing
my Caliphate ." Amr bin Sheban says: I saw Motawakkil in a dream
two months after he was murdered. I said to him, "What did Allah
do with you? Mo1awakkil said,' Allah forgave me for what I did for
the revival of the Sunnah.' Then I said to him, 'What will happen to
your killers?' He said, 'I have been awaiting my son Muhammad
(Muntasir). When he comes I shall complain to Allah against him."'
Caliph Motawakkil Atallah followed the Shafii school of thought
and he was the first among the Caliphs to embrace this school of
jurisprudence.

Mustansir Billah
Mustansir Billah bin Motawakkil Alallah bin Motasim Billah bin Haroon
Rasheed's real name was Mohammad and his kunya was Abu Jafar or
Abu Abdullah. He was born of a Roman African slave at Samarra in 223
A.H. After having his father Motawakkil killed, he sat on the throne on
4 Shawwal 247 A.H. He deposed both his brothers Motaz and
Muayyad, who had been made heirs apparent by his father Motawakkil.
The Turks had been dominating the Caliph' s court and their power
was increasing day by day. They had the upper hand in all affairs.
Seeing the Turks were on the ascendant and they might be harmful to
him, he geared up to curtail and reduce their powers and influence.
During his six-month Caliphate, he served the Shiites considerably.
He allowed them to pay visits to Imam Husain's grave and granted all
type of freedom to the Alawiites. Immediately after taking over the
Caliphate, he made Ahmad bin Khaseeb the prime minister and made
Bagha Kabeer the commander-in-chief. It was Bagha Kabeer and the
other Turks who coaxed him to remove his brothers from succession.
When he wanted to reduce their power, they were scared of him
because he was wise and brave and they were sure he would succeed
in his aim. Therefore, they gave his physician lbn Taifoor 30,000
dinars as a bribe to use a poisoned scalpel while letting his blood in
connection with curing a disease this led to his death.
After being Caliph less than 6 months, he died on 5 Rabi-al-Awwal
248 A.H. At the point of death he said, "O my mother! I have lost both
this world and the hereafter. I have killed my father and now I am
going after him."

Mustayeen Billah
Mustayeen Billah bin Motasim bin Haroon Rasheed's real name wa
Ahmad and his kunya was Abul Abbas. He was handsome and fai
complexioned. His face was pock marked and he stammered. He wa
born of a slave-girl named Makhariq in 221 A.H. When Muntasir die
the members of the government assembled to decide on who shoul

be chosen Calirh. Motawakkil's sons Motaz and Moayyad were
present but the Turks were wary of them because they were
responsible for their removal from successi on. Motasim Billah's son
Ahmad w as enthroned and the title Mustayeen Billah was chosen for
him. He was very noble, very eloquent and a literary scholar. He sat
on the throne on 6 Rabia Akhir 248 A.H.
When Mustayeen Billah was being taken to the royal palace for
enthronement Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir and the masses
protested, revolted and presented Motaz's claim to the Caliphate. The
Turks fou ght with them and many were killed and many escaped.
While the fight was going on the Turks were taking the oath for
Mustayeen Billah's Caliphate. When the uproar subsided, awards and
posts began to be distributed . The message was sent to Mohammad
bin Abdullah bin Tahir to come and take the oath, which he did. After
the completion of the oath news arrived that Tahir bin Abdullah bin
Tahir, the governor of Khorasan, passed away. Caliph Mustayeen
Billah appointed Mohammad bin Tahir bin Abdullah as governor
there. His uncle Talha and his son Mansoor were made rulers of
Nishapur, and Sarkhas and Khwarzam respectively. Then his uncle
Sulaiman bin Abdullah and his cousin Abbas were sent as rulers to
Tabristan and Jurjan and Talqan respectively.
In 248 A.H., Abdullah bin Yahya bin Khaqan sought permission to
perform Hajj. The Caliph permitted him but immediately after his
departure he assigned a commander named Abdullah bin Yahya to
arrest and exile him. He caught and exiled him to Riqqah accordingly.
During the same period, the Turks wanted to murder Motaz and
Moayyad . Ahmad bin Khaseeb stopped the Caliph from committing
this illegal act. Immediately after sitting on the throne as Caliph,
Mustayeen made a Turk chief Atamish his prime minister and Ahmad
bin Khaseeb his deputy. The C:::aliph put Motaz and Moayyad under
house arrest. After a short time Ahmad bin Khaseeb was also deposed
and put under surveillance. Besides becoming prime minister,
Atamish was also made the ruler of Egypt and the western territories.
Bagha Sagheer was made the governor of Halwan and Masabzan.
Similarly, Ashnas was appointed commander in chief and put in
charge of all government staff. In short, all the important posts were
given to the Turks.

History of Islam

In 249 A.H., the Romans launched an attack on the Islamic territories.
Two reputed chiefs Omar bin Abdullah and Yahya bin Yahya besides
many other Muslims were martyred in the encounter.
The Baghdad people were extremely shocked about the martyrdom of
these two leaders and they all started complaining about the Turks
that after getting power they not only killed the Caliphs and
humiliated the noblemen but also neglected to declare Jihad against
the infidels. That was why the two servants of Islam met their
martyrdom and the Romans felt encouraged to attack the Muslims.
These and other issues led to the rise of unrest in Baghdad and the
people began to make preparations for Jihad. In other words the
common people were not waiting for the military leaders and the
armed forces to address the problem of the Romans they themselves
formed an army for the Jihad. The Muslims from all around began to
come and join the Jihad and the wealthy Muslims contributed the
money necessary and a huge army left Baghdad to fight in the holy
war against the Romans. Mustayeen and the members of his
government remained in Samarra as spectators and did not intervene.
The Muslims who came out for Jihad reached Samarra and created
trouble there. They broke open the jail and set the prisoners free . After
that, the Turk chiefs Bagha, Waseef and Atamish faced these Muslims
fighters with their armies. A large number of people were killed and
their enthusiasm dissipated . Because Atamish had a greater hold on
power and was able to utilize the royal treasury, Bagha and Waseef
had enmity for him.
After Atamish, they had Abdullah bin Mohammad bin Ali made
prime minister. After a short time there developed bad blood between
Bagha Sagheer and Abdullah bin Mohammad bin Ali. Abdullah left
Samarra out of fear of Bagha Sagheer. The Caliph appointed
Mohammad bin Fadal Jurjani as the prime minister. Caliph Mustayeen
was totally under the control of the Turks. Samarra was populated
mostly by Turks and the Caliph was unable to get out of their control.
In this situation Yahya bin Omar bin Yahya bin Husain bin Zaid
Shaheed, whose kunya was Abul Husain, revolted in Kufa . Kufa was
ruled over by Ayyub bin Husain bin Musa bin Sulaiman bin Ali on
behalf of Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir. Abu! Husain forced
Ayyub out of Kufa, looted the royal treasury and occupied Kufa.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

477

Abu! Husain then left Kufa and marched towards Wasit. Mohammad
bin Abdullah bin Tahir sent Husain bin Ismail bin Ibrahim bin Husain
bin Mus' ab to defeat him. The confrontation took "place midway to
Wasit. Abul Husain defeated Husain bin Ismail and returned to Kufa.
The inhabitants of Baghdad also were ready to help Husain bin Ismail,
who rallied his forces and attacked Abu! Husain Yahya bin Omar.
Yahya came out of Kufa and fought. After a fierce battle, Abu! Husain
was killed and his head was severed and sent to Caliph Mustayeen at
Samarra. He put it into a box and kept it in the arsenal. Abu! Husain
Yahya lost his life on 15 Rajab 250 A.H.
As reward for his victory over Abu! Husain, Caliph Mustayeen
granted estates to Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir in Tabristan.
One of the estates was near the border of Delam. When Mohammad
bin Abdullah' s ruler went to take possession, a man named Rustam
opposed him. The inhabitants of Delam sjded with Rustam and his
two sons Mohammad and ]afar. At that time, Mohammad bin Ibrahim
Alawi was present in Tabristan.
Mohammad and Jafar called on him and said, "Please stake your
claim to the caliphate. We shall help you." He said, "Go to Rayy and
put this request to Hasan bin Zaid bin Mohammad bin Ismail bin
Hasan bin Zaid bin Hasan Sibt. He is my chief and leader."
Mohammad and Jafar went to their father and briefed him about the
meeting. He sent a man to Rayy. Hasan bin Zaid came to Tabristan.
The people from Delam and Darban began to come and take the oath.
A huge crowd collected and Hasan bin Zaid captured Tabristan,
which was followed by Rayy.
Receiving this news, Mustayeen sent an army to defend Hamadan. It
suffered defeat. Then Musa bin Bagha Kabeer was sent from the
capital with an army. He took Tabristan from Hasan bin Zaid's control
but Delam still remained under Hasan's control. Musa returned to
Rayy. During those days, Caliph Mustayeen appointed Dalee! bin
Yaqub a Christian as his minister. Af_ter a short time, a Turk named
Baghar developed a grievance against Dalee! Christian. Bagha
Sagheer and Waseef declared Baghar guilty in the matter. The Caliph
jailed him. The Turks created an uproar and Bagha Sagheer had
Baghar killed. This, far from g_uelling the uproar, aggravated it and

478

History of Islam

the entire city of Samarra took up arms. The flags of the insurgents
were visible on all sides. Seeing the danger Caliph Mustayeen, Bagha
Waseef, Shahik and Ahmad bin Saleh bin Shiraz left Samarra and
went to Baghdad and lodged at Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir' s
house in Baghdad in Muharram 251 A.H. The royal offices and the
whole staff followed the Caliph and went to Baghdad .
The Turks felt ashamed after the Caliph had left for Baghdad . Six
Turks from Samarra called on him and entreated him saying, "Please
come to Samarra . We are ashamed of our impertinent acts . We beg to
be excused." Caliph Mustayeen reminded them of their disloyalties
and impertinences and he refused to go to Samarra. The Turks
returned to Samarra, took Motaz bin Motawakkil out of the jail and
took the oath for his rule. Abu Ahmad bin Haroon Rasheed was also
present there. When he was asked to take the oath, he said, " As 1 have
taken the oath for Mustayeen and Motaz has accepted his dismissal
from succession, I shall not take the oath."
Motaz left Abu Ahmad alone and did not insist on his taking the oath.
Bagha Kabeer' s sons Musa and Abdullah also tobk the oath for Motaz.
Thus all those who preferred Motaz, came to Motaz at Samarra and
those who preferred Mustayeen left Samarra and went to Baghdad.
The rulers and governors of the provinces also followed suit. Some
joined the one and some the other. There were two Caliphs, one in
Samarra and the other in Baghdad. The dynasty of Tahir and the
Khorasanis were more on Mustayeen' s side while all Turks and some
other chiefs joined Motaz. The Caliphs continued fighting for 11
months. Both entered into correspondence with the governors of the
provinces and tried to win their sympathy. This war was not confined
to Samarra and Baghdad but spread to other provinces. However, the
concentration was greater around Baghdad because the other areas
were waiting to see the results from the capital. ·
Finally, in Thul Qadah 251 A.H. Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir,
the commander of Mustayeen's army in Baghdad, launched such a

fierce attack on the Turks who were besieging Baghdad, that they
were defeated and fled away. Bagha and Waseef were with
Mustayeen in Baghdad. They also accompanied Mohammad bin
Abdullah bin Tahir with their small army of Turks consisting of men
loyal to them and were part of Mustayeen's army.
When Bagha and Waseef saw the Turks defeated and fleeing from the
Khorasanis and Iraqis, their national and racial prejudice received a
jolt. They separated and joined the runaway army. The Turks became
encouraged with their arrival, organized and ordered their armies to
return and lay siege to Baghdad again.
In Baghdad, the civilians spread the rumor that Mohammad bin
Abdullah bin Tahir was deliberately putting Caliph Mustayeen into
trouble which led to the loss of his enthusiasm for the struggle.
On 6 Muharram 252 A.H., Mustayeen Billah wrote to Motaz Billah
recognizing his Caliphate and renouncing his own. Caliph Motaz then
entered Baghdad, put the deposed Caliph under surveillance and sent
him to Wasit. Mustayeen lived there under the custody of one of
Motaz' s commanders for 9 months then he came back to Sarnarra and
was slain at Caliph Motaz's suggestion.

Motaz Billah
Motaz Billah bin Motawakkil Atallah bin Motasim Billah bin Haroon
Rasheed was born of a Roman salve girl named Fatahyah at Samarra
in 232 A.H. He was made Caliph in Samarra in Muharrarn 251 A.H.
After being at war with Mustayeen Billah for one year, he succeeded
in forcing him to abdicate. He was very handsome. Ashnas the Turk
died the same year he was enthroned. He had left 50,000 dinars,
which were seized. by Motaz Billah to run his administration. When
Motaz Billah took the throne, he was 19. He made Ahmad bin Israil
his minister and allowed Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir to
continue as the chief of the Baghdad Police. Mohammad bin Abdullah
bin Tahir was the governor of Khorasan his deputy lived in Khorasan
and he himself lived in Baghdad. It was the Turks who had enthroned
Motaz and so he was under their influence. The Khorasanis and Iraqis

bin Abdullah used to pay their salaries.
Motaz Billah st9pped their salaries and allowances. ln Rajab 252 A.H.,
he deposed his brother Moayyad from the succession, sent him to jail
and had him killed. In Ramadan 252 A.H., the army revolted because
of not receiving their salaries and started to fight with Mohammad bin
Abdullah bin Tahir. Mohammad bin Abdullah quelled the rebellion
with great difficulty. The same year saw a riot break out between the
Turks and the Arabs starting a civil war. The inhabitants of Baghdad
sided with the Arabs but the Turks succeeded fraudulently in killing
and exiling the Arabs and their leaders.
The same year Caliph Motaz Billah appointed Husain bin Abi
Shorab to the post of Chief Justice. The respect for the institution
of the Caliphate had disappeared, the governors of different
provinces began t.o con~ider themselves independent and the
Khawarij and Alawiites began to revolt. Musawir bin Abdullah bin
Musawir Bijli Khwarji captured Mousil and declared his
independence and all the forces sent to fight him by the Caliph
were defeated and chased away.
In 253 A.H., the Turks demanded their generals Waseef, Bagha and
Simataweel, to pay four months saJ.aries in advance. They told them
that the treasury was empty and payment was not possible. The Turks
grew restless and the generals informed Motaz Billah. Motaz Billah
himself was helpless. The Turks caught Waseef and killed him. At that
time, there was a rivalry between Babakyal and Bagha Sagheer. The
Caliph showed greater favor for Babakyal. Bagha made up his mind
to put the Caliph to death but Motaz Billah somehow found out and
Babakyal's men did away with Bagha Sagheer.

Death of Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir
M_ohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir, the governor of Khorasan died in
Baghdad in 253 A.H. Before his death, his will made his son
Obaidullah his deputy and the governor of Khorasan. Obaidullah's
brother Tahir bin Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir opposed him.
They fell out regarding who should lead the funeral prayer. In light o
the will, Obaidullah was declared to be his father's deputy. Late

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

Caliph Motaz Billah made another brother Sulaiman bin Abdullah bin
Tahir the deputy of Mohammad bin Abdullah bin Tahir and he made
Baghdad his headquarters and began to discharge his duties and
manage the expeditions.

Ahmad bin Tuloon
Among the Turkish generals, Babakyal like Bagha, Waseef and
Simataweel was a famous and popular leader. The same year Motaz
Billah deputed Babakyal as the governor of Egypt. Babakyal deputed
on his own behalf Ahmad bin Tuloon as the governor of Egypt.
Tuloon was a Turk who was captured in the battle of Farghana. He was
brought up in the family of the Caliph and was cow1ted as one of the
royal slaves. His son Ahmad was brought up in the capital and was.well
versed in administrative affairs. When Babakyal became the governor of
Egypt, he was considering that who he should assign as the governor of
Egypt on his behalf. His advisors named Tuloon. He agreed and sent
Tuloon to Egypt where he took over and managed the affairs there.
Later, Caliph Mohtadi made the Turk Yarkooj the governor of Egypt
who retained Ahmad bin Tuloon as his deputy in Egypt.
In this way Ahmad bin Tuloon gained a firm hold on Egypt as a ruler
and his descendants ruled it by s~ccession and minted their own coins
there. In short, Egypt should be considered excluded from the
Abbasid Caliphate from 253 A.H. or at least that the Tuloon
government was founded in Egypt in 253 A.H.

Yaqub bin Laith Saffar
Both Yaqub bin Laith and his brother Amr bin Laith owned shops
making copper and brass utensils in Sajistan. There were revolts in
several places following the weakening of the Caliphate and the
Khwarij also revolted. The Alawiites supporters also came out against
the Abbasids. One- of them named Saleh bin Nasr Kanani took up
arms. A group of the wealthy, noblemen and common masses
collected around him. Yaqub bin Laith also joined them. Saleh fought
and somehow captured Sajistan and forced the members of the Tahir
dynasty out of Sajistan.' Saleh died after this victory. Dirham bin
Hasan followed as his successor. However, the governor of Khorasan

1

482

History of Islam

captured and sent him to Baghdad. Saleh's group chose Yaqub bin
Laith as its Amir. Yaqub, by virtue of his prudence and valor, completed
the capture of Sajistan and expelled Mohammad bin Abdullah bin
Tahir' s governor of Herat, Mohammad bin Aus Ambari and took over
Herat. He then began to conquer the territories of Khorasan.
Meanwhile the governor of Iran, Ali bin Husain bin Shibil, wanted to
conquer Kerman. Yaqub bin Lai th also wanted control over Kerman.
Yaqub bin Laith defeated and chased away Ali bin Husain's
commanders and finally invaded and conquered Shiraz, the capital of
Iran in 255 A.H. At once he went back to Sajistan and sent an
application to the Caliph's court that read, "Great unrest was
prevalent in this region. The people here have made me their Amir. I
am obedient and loyal to Amir Al-Muminin." Gradually he removed
the families of Tahir from Khorasan, occupied it and established his
own permanent government. Tahir bin Husain's descendants had
ruled over Khorasan continuously but they were always connected
with the Caliph's court and one member of this family was always
appointed to the administration of the Baghdad Police department.
None of the Abbasids wanted to take Khorasan from the Tahir family
because they had always regarded themselves as the servants and
subordinates of the Abbasid Caliphs so they continued to receive title
to the governorship from them and in return, the Tahir family would
pay the fixed taxes to the Caliph. However, the government which
Yaqub bin Laith setup was different. It would become known as the
Saffariah State and its details follow later on in the narrative.

Motaz Billah: Deposition and Death
Caliph Motaz was completely under the control of the Turk generals
and whatever they wanted he would do for them. The treasury had
been drained because the generals had usurped it. The soldiers
demanded the Caliph to pay their salaries. The Caliph was helpless.
Finally, the Turks demanded payment or else they would kill Saleh bin
Waseef who they considered responsible for manipulating the Caliph.
Saleh bin Waseef was a Turk general and the Caliph was afraid of
him. Seeing the problem Motaz went to his Roman mother Fatahyah
for some money to solve the problem. She had large sums of money

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

483

but she refused to part with any on the pretext of impending poverty.
The Turks, in coalition with Saleh bin Waseef, Mohammad bin Bagha
Sagheer and Babakyal, armed themselves fully and went to the door
of the Caliph' s palace and called Motaz. Caliph Motaz sent word, "I
have taken medicine. I am too ill and weak to come out." Hearing this
the Turks made a forced entry into the palace and brought out the
Caliph dragging him by the legs. They beat him up, abused him and
made him stand bareheaded in the sun in the courtyard. Then
everybody who passed by slapped him in the face. When his
humiliation went beyond limits, he was asked to abdicate. He refused.
Then the chief judge Husain bin Abi Shorab and members of the
government were called to witness the dismissal of the Caliph. All of
them put their signatures on it and Motaz was thrown into a dungeon
without food and water leading ultimately to his death. This occurred
in Rajab 255 A.H. He died on 8 Shaban 255~A.H.
They brought Motaz's cousin Mohammad bin Wathiq from Baghdad
and put him on the throne and bestowed on him the title of Mohtadi
Billah. When Motaz's mother saw her son's arrest and humiliation,
she escaped through a tunnel and went into hiding somewhere in
Samarra. When Mohtadi become Caliph, she received amnesty from
Saleh bin Waseef, the Caliph's deputy, and appeared in Ramadan 255
A.H. When Saleh initiated inquiries about her wealth it came to light
that she was in possession of 10,300,000 dinars and gold and jewels
worth more than that although Motaz had asked for only 50,000
dinars, a sum which would have been sufficient to put an end to the
unrest in the army. Saleh seized all her wealth and goods and said,
"This unlucky woman had her son killed for 50,000 dinars although
she had millions of dinars in her possession." Then he sent her to
Makkah. She lived there until Motamid succeeded to the throne. Then
she went to Samarra where she died in 264 A.H.

Mohtadi Billah
Mohtadi Billah bin Wathiq Billah bin Motasim Billah bin Haroon
Rasheed's real name was Mohammad and his kunya was Abu Ishaq.
He was born during his grandfather Motasim Billah' s period of
Caliphate in 218 A.H . He became Caliph on 29 Rajab 255 A.H. at the

age of 37. He was light brown in complexion, lean and thin,
handsome, pious and devout, just and brave. He struggled
considerably to uphold the divine commandments. Right from his
accession to his death, he continuously observed the fast but he did
not have any supporters. He came at such a bad time that it was
difficult to restore the old Islamic honor and glory. Hashim bin Qasim
says: During the month of Ramadan I was sitting near Mohtadi. It was
evening. When I stood up to leave, he asked me to sit down. Then we
broke the fast together and performed our prayer. When Mohtadi
ordered supper, it was brought in a small willow basket. It contained
thin loaves of bread, a pinch of salt in a cup, vinegar in,another and
olive oil in a third cup. He invited me to eat. I began to eat and
thought that more food would follow so I ate slowly. Mohtadi looked
at me and said, "Don't you observe the fast?" I said, " Yes" Then he
said, "Will you not observe it tomorrow?" I said, "It is the month of
Ramadan. Why shouldn't I observe it?" He said, "Then eat well and
don't expect that more food will be coming for there is nothing here
r xcept this." I~ w~s taken by surprise and said, Amir al Muminin!
,;What is this? Allah has given you all the delicacies, conveniences and
comforts of life." He said, "Yes, that is true. However, when I
reflected, I found that Omar bin Abdul Aziz among Banu Umayyah
was reduced to a skeleton due to his under- eating and preoccupation
with providing all facilities to his subjects. Then I turned my attention
to my family and I was highly ashamed to find that we, the Banu
Hashim, are quite unlike them. That is why I have adopted the way
you see." He had put a strict ban on sports and entertainment,
declared singing and playing musical instruments unlawful and
prohibited the royal staff from being tyrannical to the people. In
matters of administrative work, he was strict. He attended the court
daily and handled the cases in open court. He used to do the
accounting by having the accountants sit in front of him.
As has been recorded earlier, the Turks also made Mohtadi Billah
Caliph. After enthroning him Saleh bin Wasif, the most influential
among the Turks who dominated him most arrested and killed
Ahmad bin Israil, Zaid bin Motaz Billah and Abu Nuh and confiscated
their money and property. Then he arrested Hasan bin Mukhallad and
seized his goods. When Caliph Mohtadi Billah came to know about

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

485

these incidents, he was extremely shocked and said, "Was ~heir arrest
for an ordinary crime that they were also killed?" Following that the
Caliph turned all the slave-girls and singers out of Samarra. He
ordered all pets to be killed and the dogs to be set free . He made
Sulaiman bin Wahab his minister. But Saleh ibn Waseef, by virtue of
his intelligence and careful planning, brought him under his control
and began to rule himself. Musa bin Bagha was not present at the time
of Motaz' s deposition and Mohtadi's accession. He had been in Rayy.
When he heard that Saleh had deposed Motaz and enthroned
Mohtadi, he announced his intention of avenging Motaz's blood and
marched to the capital. After he arrived, he sent a request to the
Caliph for permission to come to him. Saleh went into hiding when he
heard of Musa's arrival.
The Caliph permitted Musa to call on him. Soon after his arrival, he
captured the Caliph. He then had him mounted on a mule and wanted
to take him to the prison. Mohtadi said, " Musa! Fear Allah, what is it
that you want?" Musa said, "My intention is good. Please swear that
you will not side with Saleh." The Caliph swore. M,usa took the oath
at his hands immediately. Then Musa began to search for Saleh. The
Caliph tried to reconcile between Musa and Saleh. Consequently,
Musa and his men suspected that the Caliph knew where Saleh was
and that it was he who was concealing him. The Turks met at Musa
bin Bagha' s house for council, and thought of killing or deposing
Caliph Mohtadi. The Caliph came to know about this meeting and
sent for all of them to appear in his court. He himself came to the court
armed and with a face that reflected great anger. He said to the Turks,
" I have come to know about your council. Do not take me like other
Caliphs. As long as I hold the sword in my hand, I will kill most of
you . I have left my will and I am ready to kill and be killed.
Remember that enmity with me will prove fatal to you. I declare on
oath that I do not know where Saleh is." They were silent when they
heard this and their conspiracy subsided. Then Musa proclaimed a
10,000 dinars reward for the capture of Saleh.
By chance, Saleh was located and Musa had him killed, then had his
head put on a spear and taken throughout the city. Mohtadi
disapproved of it but he could not do anything against the Turk' s
power. He was quite helpless. Finally, he wrote a letter to the Turk

.

:
I

486

History of Islam

chief named Babakyal asking him to kill Musa. Babakyal showed the
letter to Musa. Musa rushed with his army to the Caliph's palace. The
people of the western territories and Farghana defended the Caliph
and a number of encounters took place.
Meanwhile Babakyal was put in Mohtadi's prison as a captive. Caliph
Mohtadi had him killed and his head thrown over to the Turks side.
This excited them even more and the Turks who were in the Caliph's
army became angry at Babakyal's murder and went over to Musa's
army. During this period the Turks had besieged the Caliph, the
subjects of Baghdad, Samarra and other places that had been praying
for Caliph Mohtadi as they were. very pleased with his justice and
generosity and thought of him as a righteous Caliph. However, the
consequences were quite adverse. The Caliph was defeated . The Turks
arrested him and had his testicles crushed until he died.
This tragedy occurred on 14 Rajab 256 A.H. Caliph Mohtadi ran his
Caliphate for 15 days short of a year. He was 38 when he lost his life.
After that, the Turks took Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Motawakkil out of
captivity (he was in captivity at Josaq) and put him on the throne.
They took the oath for him and chose Motamid Alallah as his title.

Motamid Alallah
Motamid Alallah bin Motawakkil Atallah bin Motasim Billah bin
Haroon Rasheed was born of a Roman slave girl named Fatyan.
Caliph Motamid made Obaidullah bin Yahya bin Khaqan his minister.
Obaidullah fell off his horse and died in 263A.H. Then Mohammad
bin Mukhallad was made the minister.

The Revolt of the Alawiites
In 256 A.H. Ibrahim bin Mohammad bin Yahya bin Abdullah bin
Mohammad bin Hanafia bin Ali bin Abi Talib alias Ibn Sufi and Ali
bin Zaid Alawi revolted against the Abbasid Caliphate in Egypt and
Kufa respectively. Ibn Sufi suffered defeat in several battles and fled
from Egypt and went to Makkah where the governor of Makkah
arrested him and sent him to Ahmad bin Tuloon in Egypt. He
imprisoned him and later released him. After his release, he went to

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

487

Madinah where he died . Ali bin Zaid revolted in Kufa and expelled the
governor and took it over. Caliph Motamid sent a commander named
Shah bin Michael to Kufa but he was defeated by Ali bin Zaid. Then
the Caliph sent another commander named Kajoor who defeated Ali
bin Zaid. In 256 A.H. he re-attacked Ali bin Zaid which resulted in his
defeat and arrest. Kajoor went to the capital with him. Husain bin Zaid
Alawi captured Rayy and Musa bin Bagha set out to fight against him.
A man named Ali posing as an Alawiite previously drew the people's
attention to himself in Bahrain and then went to Ahsa. There he posed
as an Alawiite but with a different lineage. As the Alawiites were
revolting in different places, he had a strong craving for power and kept
drawing people's attention to himself by posing as an Alawiite but his
lineage continued to be questioned everywhere proving that he was not
an Alawiite. At last, in coalition with a few slaves in Baghdad he went to
Basra and announced to the slaves that whoever came over to him
would be freed. It attracted many of them and they rallied around him.
When the masters of the slaves came to him and wanted to talk about
them, he had them arrested and later Ali released them.
The number of slaves continued multiplying under Ali's flag and he
with fiery speeches coaxed and induced them to conquer territory
with the power of their swords. Then he looted Qadsiya and its
adjoining areas and returned to Basra. The people of Basra fought but
were defeated. Following that, they fought with him several times but
were defeated each time.
The slave army captured Basra. The Caliph deputed the Turk Abu Bilal
with a 4,000 man army under his command to confront them. The
confrontation took place near the river Riyan. The slaves defeated and
chased them away. They captured not only Basra but also, Ahwaz and
other places. The Turk leaders brought armies from the Caliph's court
repeatedly but always returned defeated. Finally, it was Sayeed bin
Saleh who crushed them and expelled them from Basra. However, on
15 Shawwal 257 A.H. they recaptured Basra and burnt it to the ground.
The beautiful buildings of Basra were reduced to ashes and rubble.
Assessing the situation Caliph Motamid sent Mohammad Maroof
alias Molid with a large army. The slaves came out of Basra and
fought with him at the Maqul River. They put Molid' s army to rout,

488

History of Islam

looted their goods and killed the fleeing soldiers. Then they returned
to the Maqul River. Then the Caliph deputed Mansoor bin Jafar Khayyat
to tackle the problem. They came to fight under the command of their
chief Ali bin Aban. There was a fierce battle. Swords dazzled until noon
finally, Mansoor bin Jafar was defeated and killed.
Hearing the news, Caliph Motamid Billah recalled his brother Abu
Ahmad Muwaffaq, whom he had deputed as the governor of Makkah,
gave him the governorship of Egypt, Qansareen and Awasim and
ordered him to fight against the slaves. Then he gave another army to
Mufleh and sent him to fight them also. These two armies marched to
face the slave army.
In the battle that followed, Mufleh was killed and his men began to
flee. This caused anxiety and disintegration among Muwaffaq's men.
At last, Muwaffaq dodged the enemy and saved his army,
reorganized them, came to the Abu Khaseeb River and fought with
the slaves, defeated them and captured many of them he also freed
many of his men from their captivity and returned to Samarra. That
defeat did not crush them completely. They rallied again and started
looting, killing and plundering. They continued on their looting and
killing spree in Basra and Iraq until 270 A.H.

Yaqub bin Laith's Governorship
In 256 A.H., the very first year of Motamid' s accession Mohammad
bin Wasil bin Ibrahim Tamimi, an Iraqi Arab living in Iran for many
years, conspired with some 1 Kurds and killed the governor of Iran,
Harith bin Seema and captured it. When Yaqub bin Laith Saffar found
out, he invaded Iran. M'"uwaffaq thought it wise to save Iran from
going under Yaqub Saffar's control so he had the letters of
governorship for Takharistan and Balkh in Yaqub's name written by
Motamid and sent to Yaqub bin Laith with the message: "Give up the
thought of Iran and establish your government in Balkh and
Takharistan." Yaqub bin Laith liked the idea and he made proper
arrangements for Balkh and Takharistan, reached Kabul and arrested
Ratbeel. Then he dispatched gifts to the Caliph.
He visited Sajistan and began to take control of the cities of Herat and
Khorasan. In 259 A.H., he captured -Khorasan and expelled all the

The Caliphate of the Abbas ids (Second Phase)

489

members of the Tahir family . Caliph Motamid wrote him a threatening
letter saying, "Be content with the cities and the governorship of that
which has been given to you. Don't capture Khorasan." But Yaqub did
not pay any heed to this warning. In 260 A.H., Hasan bin Zaid Alawi
took an army from Delam and invaded Yaqub. In a fierce battle Hasan
bin Zaid suffered defeat and returned to Delam and Yaqub conquered
Sarya and Amul then he turned to Sajistan.

The Rebellion in Mousil
Motamid deputed the Turk commander Satgeen as the governor of
Mousil. The Turks started perpetrating atrocities on the inhabitants of
Mousil. As a consequence of this abuse, they made Yahya bin
Sulaiman their leader, beat the Turks and expelled them.
The Caliph was informed of the rebellion. Turk armies were sent.
Bloody battles were waged but the result was disastrous. The Caliph's
army of Turks lost and Sulaiman bin Yahya's government was
established in Mousil. This happened in 260-61A.H.

lbn Mufleh, lbn Wasil, lbn Laith Saffar
When Yaqub bin Laith invaded Iran to snatch it from Mohammad bin
Wasil in 256 A.H. the Caliph bestowed on him the governorship of
Balkh and Takharistan and sent him back. Then he sent Abdur Rahman
bin Mufleh with an army to win the province of Iran from Mohammad
bin Wasil. Abdur Rahman and Mohammad began to fight.
The Caliph deputed the Turk commander Tashtamar to reinforce
Abdur Rahman bin Mufleh. Tashtamar was killed and in 262 A.H.
Mohammad bin Wasil captured Abdur Rahman bin Mufleh. Caliph
Motamid began lo correspond with Mohammad bin Wasil and
initiated a move to liberate Abdur Rahman bin Mufleh. Mohammad
bin Wasil did not reply to his letters but killed Abdur Rahman bin
Mufleh and began to prepare to invade the city of Wasit where Musa
bin Bagha was stationed with his army. When Mohammad bin Wasil
proceeded towards Wasit, Ibrahim bin Seema blocked his way.
From the opposite side Abu Saj who was made governor of Iran by
the Caliph sent his son-in-law Abdur Rahman to fight against

490

History of Islam

Muhammad bin Wasil and conquer Iran. Abu Saj was engaged in
dealing with the slaves who had made more trouble in Basra and the
surrounding area. When Abu Saj's son-in-law Abdur Rahman set out
with the army, he came across the slaves' leader Ali bin Aban on the
way. Ali bin Aban defeated and killed Abdur Rahman. Mohammad
bin Wasil and his army were ready to confront Ibrahim Seema at
Ahwaz. In the meantime, news arrived that Yaqub bin Laith Saffar
invaded Faras, so Muhammad Wasil Tamimi, ended the confrontation
with Ibrahim Seema and returned to Iran. Finally, Saffar and
Mohammad bin Wasil fought. Ibn Wasil lost and escaped and Yaqub
Saffar captured Iran. Khorasan had already come under his rule and
in 261 A.H., he brought all of Iran under his control.

The Birth of the Government of the Samaniites
The details about the Samani dynasty will follow later on. However,
in order to remind the readers and to maintain the sequence of events
it is pertinent to say something about its origin here.
Asad bin Saman was a member of a reputed and respectable family in
Khorasan. He had four sons: Noah, Ahmad, Yahya and Ilyas. During
the period when Mamoon Rasheed was staying in Merv, these four
brothers called on him. On the suggestion of his Prime Minister Fadal
bin Saha!, he appointed them to important posts. When Mamoon
Rasheed proceeded to Baghdad after making Ghassan bin Abbad his
deputy and the governor of Khorasan, the latter deputed Noah,
Ahmad, Yahya, and Ilyas as the rulers of Samarkand, Farghana, Shash
and Ashrosna, and Herat respectively.
When Mamoon Rasheed sent his famous general Tahir bin Husain as
the governor of Khorasan, he also maintained the status quo by
retaining them in their posts. However, when Noah bin Asad died
Tahir annexed the regions of Samarkand to Yahya and Ahmad's
territories. After a short time, Ilyas died, this was during Tahir's
governorship, Tahir made Ilyas's son, Abu !shag Muhammad, the
ruler of Herat. Ahmad bin Asad had seven sons: Nasr, Yaqub, Yahya,
Ismail, Abul Ashas, Abu Khanam, Hameed and Asad. When Ahmad
bin Asad passed away, his elder son Nasr succeeded him as the
Governor of Samarkand.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

491

Nasr continued to be given the governorship of this province until
the Tahir family was dethroned from Khorasan and Yaqub bin
Laith Saffar captured it. In 261 A.H., Caliph Motamid Alallah sent
the letter of governorship of Samarkand to Nasr directly. The
Governor of this province used to receive the letter of
Governorship from the Governor of Khorasan. In view of losing
control over Khorasan and Yaqub Saffar gaining control over it,
the Caliph thought it best that he should keep his leadership in
Mawaraunnahr. Therefore, the letter was sent from the Caliph's
court with the instruction that he should protect Samarkand from
Yaqub Saffar. Nasr bestowed the state of Bukhara on his brother
Ismail and he himself continued to rule over Samarkand. In 275
A.H., they developed resentment against each other, which
escalated into a military confrontation. Ismail won and Nasr came
to Ismail in chains. Ismail ran to him and kissed his feet, made him
sit on the throne and promised to obey him. They reconciled and
both the brothers began to govern under the name of Ismail. This
same Ismail founded the government of the Samanids, which will
be dealt with later on in the narrative.

The Oath for the Heir Apparent
ln Shawwal 261 A.H., Caliph Motamid held open court and made the
proclamation before all the courtiers that his son Jafar would be the
heir apparent and after him his brother Ahmad Mowaffaq. However,
in case Jafar did not reach the age of discretion, then Mowaffaq would
be the Caliph first to be followed by Jafar.
Everyone took an oath on this proclamation. Jafar was given the title
Mufawwad ilallah, and made the Governor of Africa, Egypt, Syria,
Mousil, Jazirah and Armenia. Musa bin Bagha was made his deputy.
Abul Wajid was entitled as Nasir li deenillah Al-Mowaffaq and made
the Governor of the Eastern countries, Baghdad, Kufa, the route to
Makkah, Yemen, Kaskar, Ahwaz, Iran, Isfahan, Rayy, Zanjan and
Sindh. Two different flags were made for them. After this oath, Caliph
Motamid assigned the task of punishing the rebel slaves to his brother
Mowaffaq.

l

492

History of Islam

The Battle of Saffar
Mowaffaq had hardly set out towards the rebellious slaves when the
Caliph received news that Yaqub Saffar after capturing and
consolidating Khorasan was marching towards the capital with his
army. The Caliph's brother Mowaffaq postponed his expedition
against the rebels and returned to the capital. The Caliph himself left
the capital and stayed at Zafranya and sent his brother Mowaffaq to
fight with Saffar. The right flank was controlled by Musa bin Bagha
while the left one was commanded by Masroor Balkhi. Mowaffaq was
in the middle. They fought a very fierce battle from dawn to dusk.
Sometimes Saffar' s army retreated and sometimes Mowaffaq' s army
fell back. The battle remained indecisive. Meanwhile the Caliph sent
another army to aid Mowaffag. The arrival of this fresh army spelled
defeat for Yagub bin Laith's army. Yagub and his soldiers fled.
Mowaffaq and his army looted their camp. After being defeated Saffar
moved towards Khazistan and stayed at Jandisabor. Mowaffag could
not follow Saffar and went to Wasit. He fell ill and returned to Baghdad.
While Mowaffaq and Saffar were at war, Muhammad bin Wasil who
had fled after loosing Iran to Saffar found an opportunity and
rebelled, the field of opposition was empty and he recaptured Iran.
When Saffar went to Jundisabor after his defeat, the slaves sent a letter
to'"Saffar, goading him to fight against the Caliph and assuring him of
their help. In reply to the letter Saffar quoted following Verses of Qur'an:
"Say O Unbelievers .. ...... to you your religion and to me my
religion." (109:1-6)
And sent an army under the command of Omar bin Sirsi to fight
against Muhammad bin Wasil. Omar bin Sirsi expelled Wasil from
Iran and captured it. After fighting with Yaqub Saffar, Motamid sent
Musa bin Bagha to crush the rebellious slaves. Saffar sent a
commander to Ahwaz. It was at Ahwaz that the three armies, the
Caliph's, Saffar's and the slaves' clashed with one another. No one
supported the other. Yagub Saffar left Jundisabor and went to Sajistan
after deputing Aziz bin Sirri in Nishapur and his brother Omar bin
Laith in Herat. These events took place in 261 A.H.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

493

The Conquest of Wasit
After capturing Jundisabor and deputing his administrator, Yaqub
Saffar had gone to Sajistan. A commander had been sent to Ahwaz.
Finally, the slaves recognized Saffar's conquest of Ahwaz, made peace
with Saffar and turned to Wasit. In Wasit, a Turk commander was in
charge by the order of the Caliph. The Caliph's soldiers could not
stand against the slaves and they defeated him and conquered Wasit.
This occurred in 263 A.H.

Ahmad bin Tuloon' s occupation of Syria
In 264 A.H., a Turk named Majoor ruled over Syria. His son
succeeded him after his death. Upon receipt of this news Ahmad bin
Tuloon left his son Abbas as his deputy in Egypt and he went to
Damascus. Majoor' s son laid down his arms and Tuloon' s men
captured Damascus and all their territories in 264 A.H. He stayed in
Syria for two years and after making satisfactory arrangements, he
went back to Egypt in 266 A.H. From this point, Ahmad bin Tuloon' s
territory included Egypt and Syria.

Yaqub bin Laith Saffar's Death
Yaqub bin Lai th Saffar had gained much power. Ahmad bin Abdullah
Khajistani, Sayeed bin Tahir, Ali bin Yahya Kharji, Hasan bin Zaid
Alawi, Rafe bin Harisimah had all made their claims to being the ruler
of Khorasan, Tabristan and Iran. They had been at war with one
another with no clear victor. Outwardly it seemed Yaqub bin Laith
Saffar was more able, braver and more powerful and he possessed a
larger territory. When Motamid realized that Syria had gone out of his
control, a greater part of Iraq was under the slaves occupation and the
eastern province of Khorasan and Iran had been lost, he thought it
wise that the letter of Governorship of provinces like Khorasan should
be given to Yaqub bin Laith from the Caliph's court. By making him
legitimate, the Caliph felt that he could win his allegiance and these
territories would have a proper administration. The negotiations to
arrange this had already started when Yaqub bin Lai th Saffar died of
colic. The Caliph had sent the documents of Governorship of Iran to

494

History of Islam

Yaqub Saffar but it reached him when he was dying. After his death,
his brother Amr bin Laith Saffar succeeded to the throne. He sent a
declaration of his obedience and allegiance to the Caliph. The Caliph
was overjoyed and bestowed on him the Governorship of Khorasan,
Isfahan, Sindh and Sajistan in addition to making him the Chief of
Police of Baghdad and Samarra. He also sent him a royal robe. This
appointment letter and the royal robe led to the recognition of his
government willingly by the masses and added to his power.

Extermination of the Rebel Slaves by Mowaffaq and
Motazid
The rebellion of the slaves and the repeated failure of the Caliph's
armies against the slaves was not something ordinary. The slaves had
been defeating the Caliph's armies and famous generals for 10 years
and had destroyed the peace in the Iraqi cities. Each slave had forcibly
kept 10 to 15 Alawi and Hashmi women. Their leaders named
Bahbood and Khabbees used to verbally abuse the righteous Caliphs,
the family of the Prophet (~ ) and his wives from their pulpits.
Bahbood claimed to be omniscient and a Prophet. These slaves had
killed thousands of Muslims. Their continuous victories had left the
people's hearts filled with terror and they put an end to the Turk' s
pride of valor.
The Turk's trembled at their names. Ultimately, Caliph Motamid' s
brother Mowaffaq assigned his son Abu! Abbas who later became
Caliph with the title Motazid Billah, the expedition to fight the slaves
in Rabia Thani 266 A.H. After a very fierce battle near Wasit, he
defeated them. This was the first significant setback they received
from the Caliph's army. After this Mowaffaq joined his son and both
of them began to defeat them regularly over the next four years. The
slaves' leader Khabbees was killed on 1 Saffar 270 A.H. and their
reign of terror was ended. When news reached Baghdad that the slave
leader was killed and the evil ended, there was a great celebration in
the city. While father and son, Mowaffaq and Motazid were at war
with the slaves the Khwarij had revolted in Mousil.
Masawar Khwarji, as has already been stated, had been killed in 263
A.H. His followers and disciples formed different groups and began

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

495

to fight with each other until 276 A.H. No effort was made by the
Caliph's court to restore peace in the region, which lets us know the
condition of things in the occupied territories.

Anarchy in Khorasan
When Yaqub Saffar died, Caliph Motamid appointed his brother Amr
·bin Laith as Governor. However, the supporters of the Tahir dynasty
were still present in Khorasan. Two of them, Abu Talha and Rafe bin
Harisimah, formed groups in the name of Husain bin Tahir and
established their own government. They expelled Amr bin Laith's
administrators from the cities of the territory then they quarreled with
each other. In the ensuing battles they used to seek help from the ruler
of Bukhara, Ismail bin Ahmad bin Asad bin Samani.
Ismail Samani sometimes would help one and sometimes the other
and sometimes he would help their common enemy Amr bin Laith
Saffar. In brief, there was great tension in these territories. During this
time, Mowaffaq deputed Muhammad bin Tahir as Governor of
Khorasan. In 271 A.H. Caliph Motarnid, who had given Amr bin Laith
Saffar the Governorship of Khorasan, deposed Amr Saffar.
Muhammad bin Tahir stayed in Baghdad. He deputed Rafe bin
Harisimah as the governor of Khorasan and his deputy. This did not
make any difference or put an end to the unrest and anarchy in
Khorasan and its adjoining provinces.

Ahmad bin Tuloon's Death
Ahmad bin Tuloon, who has already been dealt with in detail, had
Egypt and Syria under his occupation. Caliph Motarnid was a Caliph
in name only and his brother Mowaffaq by virtue of his wisdom and
valor dominated all affairs of the Caliphate. Motarnid entered into
correspondence with Ahmad bin Tuloon and wanted him to go to
Egypt on his behalf. This htrppened in 269 A.H. while Mowaffaq was
engaged in war with the rebd slaves. Mowaffaq tried to make
Motamid understand with the help of other leaders that supporting
Ahmad bin Tuloon was not to their benefit and asked him to desist,
because of this Mowaffaq became angry with Ahmad Tuloon.

Ii

496

History of Islam

Ahmad Tuloon became sick in Antakia and died and his son
Khumarwaih succeeded him as the Governor of Syria and Egypt.
When Mowaffaq became free from the slave rebellion in 270 A.H., he
sent Ishaq bin Kandaj and Muhammad bin Abu Saj to capture Syria.
These two commanders began to conquer city after city. Khumarwaih
sent an army to face them. These two commanders hesitated in
starting the battle and were on the defensive. In view of this,
Mowaffaq sent his son A.bu! Abbas Motazid to Syria . Motazid pushed
the Egyptian army back, conquered Damascus and continued to move
ahead. Khumarwaih came to fight and Abu! Abbas Motazid suffered a
defeat and returned to Damascus. The inhabitants of Damascus did
not open the gate of city for him. Helplessly, he went to Tartoos.
Khumarwaih came to Damascus and the circulation of his coins and
the Friday sermon in his name began. The inhabitants ~f Tartoos
revolted and expelled Abu! Abbas Motazid and began to read
Khumarwaih' s name in the Friday sermon. Abu! Abbas distressed and
a failure went back to Baghdad.

Situation in Tabristan: Alawi, Rafe and Saffar
It has been stated above that Hasan bin Zaid Alawi had estabfished
his government with the assistance of the inhabitants of Delam. Hasan
bin Zaid died in Rajab 270 A.H. Then his brother Mohammad bin Zaid
assumed power in Tabristan. In 272 A.H., a Turk administrator of
Qazween invaded Tabristan with an army of 4,000 men. Muhammad
bin Zaid faced him with 8,000 soldiers but was defeated and took refuge
in Jurjan. However, immediately after the departure of the victorious
army he re-captured Tabristan. In 275 A.H. Rafe bin Harisimah attacked
Jurjan. Muhammad b.in Zaid fought and after a prolonged battle lost
control over Tabristan. Finally, in 283 A.H., Rafe bin Harisimah was
killed while fighting with Amr bin Laith, Muhammad bin Zaid
reoccupied Jurjan but Amr bin Lai th Saffar dethroned him.
In 288 A.H., Ismail Samani caught Amr bin Laith Saffar and sent him
to Baghdad, Muhammad bin Zaid revolted in Delam again and
captured Tabristan. Then Ismail Samani sent Muhammad bin Haroon
to Tabristan. Muhammad bin Zaid was killed in the encounter and his
son Zaid bin Muhammad was caught and sent to jail in Bukhara.

Amr bin Laith Saffar
Amr bin Laith Saffar had been given the Goverriorship of Khorasan,
Sajistan and other territories by the Caliph's court as has been
recorded above and Iran was also under his control. In 271 A.H., a
letter of his dismissal was issued from the Caliph's court and the
administrator of Isfahan, Ahmad bin Abdul Aziz bin Abi Walf, was
instructed to fight Amr bin Lai th and liberate the Province of Iran.
They clashed and Amr bin Laith was defeated but he retained his hold
on the Province Iran.
Ultimately in 274 A.H., Mowaffaq himself invaded Iran, he took the
Province of Iran from Amr bin Laith and returned to Baghdad. Amr
bin Lai th went to Kerman and Sajistan and began to rule over Sajistan
and Khorasan successfully. Then he sent gifts to the Caliph's court and
enhanced his influence and in 278 A.H., he received the governorship
of the territory of Mawaraunnahr, Bukhara, Samarkand etc., from the
Caliph' s court. Ismail bin Ahmad Samani had been ruling over
Mawaraunnahr successfully. With the receipt of the governorship of
Mawaraunnahr Amr bin Laith became busy collecting soldiers, arms
and equipment. When Ismail bin Ahmed Samani found out, he wrote
to Amr bin Laith: "I have been lying here out of the way in this border
area. You have a larger country. Let me lie here and don't try to
remove me." Amr bin Laith did not pay any heed to the letter and
attacked him. Ismail Samani fought Amr bin Lai th who was captured
and sent to jail in Samarkand. In 288 A.H., Ahmed sent him to the
Caliph in Baghdad. He remained there until Caliph Motazid's death.
When Muktafi Billah came to power, he had him killed.

Conditions in Makkah and Madinah
In Madinah, Muhammad bin Hasan bin Jafar bin Musa Kazim and his
brother Ali bin Hasan began to fight against each other. Fear of the
government was non-existent. Civil wars were raging everywhere.
These two brothers also created an upheaval in Madinah. Many men
on both sides were killed. In 277 A.H., for one month Friday
congregational prayers could not be held in Madinah. The same
conditions existed in MaKkah also. Yusuf bin Abu Saj was the

Governor of Makkah. Ahmad bin Muhammad Tai was awarded the
letter of governorship from the Caliph's court in his place.
Ahmad Tai sent his slave Badr as the leader of the pilgrimage on his
behalf. Yusuf fought against him. The confrontation took place in front
of the Holy Mosque around the Ka'bah. Yusuf arrested Badr. Badr's
soldiers and the pilgrims launched a joint attack, arrested Yusuf, sent
him to Baghdad and freed Badr. The situation everywhere was
deteriorating.

Mowaffaq's Death
Caliph Motamid Billah was a nominal Caliph. His brother Mowaffaq,
by virtue of his valor ~nd wisdom, dominated over all state affairs. He
was the virtual Caliph though he was not the legal Caliph. As
mentioned above, Mowaffaq was also the heir apparent. Prior to his
rule, the Turk chiefs had been ruling and dominating the Caliph's
court. Mowaffaq maneuvered and succeeded in breaking their power.
Since he had defeated the rebel slaves, his and his son's popularity
increased considerably among the Muslims. The Turk chiefs had been
unable to defeat the sfaves and they didn't dare to oppose him.
However, since the entire administration had totally collapsed
anarchy continued to spread. The power that had held the dynasty
together was now dissipated and the territories were asserting their
independence and autonomy, which could not be suppressed . Yet,
Mowaffaq's presence in the capital was a great source of strength and
no one had the heart to challenge his leadership or expunge his name
from the Friday sermon.

When Mowaffaq returned from Isfahan, he came down with the gout.
He was treated by physicians but in vain. He died on 22 Saffar 278
A.H . and was buried at RaSaffan.' Though Caliph Motamid was living,
he was only a figurehead. Following Mowaffaq' s death, the members
of the government and generals of the army unanimously selected
Mowaffaq's son Abu! Abbas Motazid as the heir apparent and Caliph
Motamid made an announcement of his succession and placed him in
his .father's position. Since Motazid was a very experienced and brave
man, he came to dominate over all the state administration like his
father and Caliph Motamid remained ineffectual.

Qaramata
In 278 A.H., a man in Kufa named Hamdan, popularly known as
Qaramata, introduced a new religion. He was an extranist Shiite. He
believed that the Imams were only seven in number: 1. Imam Husain
(RA) 2. Ali Zianul Abedeen (RA), 3. Baqar bin Ali (RA) 4. Jafar Sadiq
(RA) 5. Ismail bin Jafar 6. Muhammad bin Ismail 7. Obaidullah bin
Muhammad . He called himself the deputy of Obaidullah bin
Muhammad although Muhammad bin Ismail did not have a son
named Obaidullah. He regarded Muhammad bin Al-Hanafia bin Ali
bin Abi Talib as a prophet and added the following words to the call
to prayer: " I bear witness that Muhammad bin Hanafia is a
Messenger." He declared the Holy Mosque in Jerusalem as the
direction for Prayer, which was made only two times a day, before
sunrise and after sunset. He maintained that some verses. were
revealed to Muhammad bin Al-Hanafia. Monday instead of Friday
was considered the holy day of the week and he did not do any work
on that day. He believed that only a few days of fasting a year was
compulsory. He declared date juice unlawful while wine was made
lawful. He said bathing after coition was unnecessary, (this of course
is in direct contravention of Islamic law.) He made certain animals
legal to be eaten while others were forbidden and declared unlawful.
Whoever opposed him was declared worthy of death. He chose for his
title Qaim Bil-Hag.
He talked to the chiefs of the slaves Khabbees and Bahbood about his
new religion and wanted to convert them to his views but they d~d not
attach any importance to him. Eight years after their defeat he began
to propagate his beliefs in Kufa and many people began to accept
them. Becoming aware of his activities the Governor of Kufa had him
arrested and put in jail.
The guards of the jail were derelict in their duties and he escaped. His
followers publicized the event as if he had special powers. Gradually
people from a far began to talk about this religion and join it.
There are a group of people who trade guidance for falsehood and are
infatuated with the blind despite their ability to see and worship that

500

History of Islam

which is senseless despite their having intelligence. These people are
found throughout history until our present time and they were the
type of people who rushed to embrace Qaramafa's new religion.

Succession of Motazid
As mentioned above after Mowaffaq's death, Motazid was made the
heir apparent and he was to be the Caliph after Jafar bin Motamid.
Jafar bin Motamid was first in succession to the throne and Motazid
was second after him. His father Mowaffaq was also the second in
succession behind Jafar but in 279 A.H. Motamid, being impressed by
Motazid's power and ability gave priority to him as heir apparent
over his own son Jafar and had the certificates authorizing his
succession issued to the Governors in the provinces.

The Roman War
The Romans have not been mentioned during the discussion of this
turbid period of Motamid's Caliphate. In 257 A.H. Saqalabi, a relative
of the king of Constantinople, Michael bin Rafael, killed him and
usurped the throne. In 259 A.H., the Romans invaded Maltiya but
were defeated. In 263 A.H., they captured the fort of Karkarah,
adjacent to Tartoos, from the Muslims. In 264 A.H., Abdullah Rasheed
bin Kaoos invaded Roman territory with 40,000 Syrian border troops.
In the initial stage he was successful but later was captured and sent
to Constantinople.
In 265 A.H., the Romans led an attack on Ain Ofa, 400 Muslim were
martyred and 400 were captured. The same year the Roman emperor
freed Abdullah bin Rasheed and sent him with a few volumes of the
Qur' an to Ahmad bin Tuloon as gifts. In 266 A.H., the war ships of the
Muslims and the Romans clashed with each other at a place adjacent
to the Island of Saqliya. The Muslims lost and the Romans captured
several of their boats. The remaining ships took shelter on the coast of
Saqliya.
Ahmad bin Tuloon' s Syrian deputy launched a successful attack on
Rome and captured a large amount of spoils of war. In 270 A.H ., the
Romans numbering 100,000 attacked Qalmiya, situated at a distance

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Second Phase)

501

of 6 miles from Tartoos. The Governor of Tartoos, Mazyar, launched a
night attack on the Romans and 70,000 of them were killed. The Chief
Prelate was captured and their Great Cross also came into the
Muslim's possession. In 273 A.H., the governor of Tartoos, Mazyar,
attacked the Romans and returned victorious. In 278 A.H., Mazyar
and Ahmad Jofi jointly invaded the Roman Empire. During the battle,
Mazyar was hit on the head by a stone from a catapult. He stopped
the fight and started to return to the capital but died on way. The
Muslims buried him at Tartoos. Although there was a great upheaval
in the Islamic world and civil wars had broken out all over, the
Romans failed to score any major success against the Muslims.

Motamid's Death
Caliph Motamid Alallah bin Motawakkil Alallah died on 20 Rajab 270
A.H. and was buried at Samarra, the capital of the Abbasid Caliph since
Motasim Billah bin Haroon Rasheed shifted there. Motamid left
Samarra and chose to live in Baghdad, which then became the capital. It
was due to this change of capital that the Turk chiefs who dominated
over the Caliph and his court lost their power suddenly. This shifting of
the capital was the idea of Motamid' s wise brother Mowaffaq.
During Motamid' s regime, the powers of the government and its
wealth had declined. The members of the government as described,
dissented, hated and opposed one another openly. All the occupied
territories were in a shambles and there were riots and anarchy
everywhere. The people had lost the fear of the Caliph's authority.
Whoever found an opportunity usurped the territory he could. The
governors of the provinces stopped sending taxes. There was total
lawlessness all over. Whoever captured a territory would introduce
his own law.
Atrocities began to be perpetrated upon the people and the governors
subjected them to all sorts of harassments with impunity.
Banu Saman established their government in Mawaraunnahr, Banu
Saffar in Sajistan, Kerman, Khorasan and Persia. Hasan bin Zaid in
Tabristan and Jurjan, the rebel slaves in Basra, uballa and Wasit, the
Khwarij in Mousil and Jazirah, Ahmad bin Tuloon in Egypt and Syria

and Ibn Aghlab in North Africa. Besides these, there were other minor
chiefs who were busy fighting trying to capture smaller territories and
states. The only symbol of the Caliph that remained was that they
mentioned his name in the Friday sermon but none of his orders were
complied with. Mowaffaq spent all his energy and life in fighting riots
and disturbances but except for the extermination of the rebel slaves,
he failed to achieve any other significant success.
It was at that time that the criminals like qaramata made their
advances. Similarly during the same period Obaidullah bin Obaid
who descended from the Egyptian kings and the Shiites of Yemen,
claimed to be the Mahdi (a future Muslim leader that was spoken of
by the Prophet ~ )- He took the majority of the members of the Banu
Kenana tribe and went to the western territories where in stages, he
found an independent government in Egypt and the rest of North
Africa. During the same period, the well-known Islamic scholars and
Muhaddith like Imam Bukhari, Imam Muslim, Abu Daud, Tirmidhi
and lbn Majah died. In short, 23 years of Motamid's caliphate passed
in this state of disintegration, distress and disappointment.

Comment
Nearly 150 years have passed since the Caliphate of Banu Abbas ended.
The Abbasid caliphate began with 100 years of grandeur and progress.
The signs of decline started appearing with the death of Motasim Billah
in 272 A.H. Inauspicious days befell the caliphate and for 20 years, the
negative impact continued until Motawakkil Alallah's murder. During
this period it was expected that the Abbasid caliphate would bring back
its 100 years of lost glory and power but with Motawakkil Alallah's
murder in 247 A.H. their abilities suddenly became paralyzed leaving
no chance for restoration. We have studied the 22-year period of aging.
The caliphate survived for several hundred years more in this
debilitated form. Many different centers of Islamic rule were
established. The caliphate of Baghdad or the Abbasid Caliphate retained
its glory but little and it was not to be a serious power again.
With the given circumstances if the remainder of the Abbasid
Caliphate is dealt with in the same detail as we have dealt with it up
to this point in history, the readers' interest in history will evaporate

and they will feel unnecessarily and mentally burdened. Brevity has
been maintained and in the rest of the narrative, our concentration
will be on the important events. At this point in the narrative many
new lineages and new dynasties of rulers are emerging and to record
them parallel to each other is difficult. However, their beginnings and
how they came to assume power in relation to their connection to the
Abbasids is important and will be referred to in their proper places.
The greatest mistake of Banu Umayyah was that it provided the way
to ruin by introducing hereditary succession and got the Muslims
habituated to this evil practice. Similarly, the fault of Banu Abbas is no
less than that of Banu Umayyah. They effaced every object of Banu
Umayyah and demolished and leveled to the ground all their
memorials. However, they fully protected the evil practice of
hereditary succession and hastened the Muslim's ruin.
The second major error they committed was that right from their very
beginning they opposed the Arabs and sympathized with the new
Muslims from Iran who were still subject to the prejudices of their
culture. From the first Caliph Saffah to Mamoon Rasheed each caliph
except Mahdi reduced the power of the Arabs and goaded and
pushed ahead those still enamored with the Zoroastrian religion with
the result that the Abbasids were unable to expand beyond the circle
of victories set by Banu Umayyah and gradually that area of their
authority continued to shrink.
Only a few of the former Zoroastrians grasped the real glory and
morality of Islam. The other descendents of the Zoroastrians created
many problems and hardships for the Abbasid caliphs but the wise
and farsighted of them succeed in overcoming these problems.
Motasim Billah organized the Turks of Mawaraunnahr as a new
group in the balance of power. Their national and racial heritage was
different than the Khorasanis. His plan would have proved effective if
he had not made the Turks more powerful than the Khorasanis and
had made the Arabs equal to them in power. However, the Arab's
relation with the Abbasids continued to be diminished. Motasim
Billah' s shifting of the capital to the Turkish village Samarra proved a
great boon to the progress of the Turks. He preferred them probably
because they were free from the influence of the Alawiites. The

,,I

i

I

504

History of Islam

Abbasids, who were Arabs, hated the Arabs simply because the
Alawiites were Arabs. These Alawiites influence on the Zoroastrian
Iranians whom the Banu Abbas used and counted on was great. This
continuously led to conflicts and deception. Distancing himself from
these two groups, Motasim selected a third group historically free
these machinations. However, the Turks unlike the Iranians were not
cultured or well versed in statecraft. They needed a strong and alert
hand to control them and use them to their best advantage.
Had there been even a few leaders with the heart and faith of Haroon
and Mamoon, the glory of the caliphate of the Abbasids would have
gone higher. Motasim was wise enough to make Samarra the capital but
coupled with the weakness of his successors and the diminished Arabic
element, created many problems, which his successors could not
remedy. The Turks were nomadic fighters without vision. They could
neither establish their own government nor did they turn to the
Alawiites to establish a dynasty. The Alawiites had removed themselves
from open contention for the Caliphate after becoming tired and
frustrated with their failures. There was no clear apprehension of any
real danger to the caliphate of the Abbasids from them.
After Motasim when commotion and turmoil erupted in the land, the
Alawiites had a far-reaching impact on all the provinces and all the
governors and administrators throughout the Islamic territories and
they became busy establishing their own separate and independent
governments.
The examples of Andalusia, Morocco and North Africa were clearly
known by all. With the failure of the heart, the circulation of blood to
all the organs of the body stopped. Observing the independence and
lawlessness of the Governors and administrators the Alawiites,
Khwarij, rebel slaves, Qaramatins and others geared up to take a
chance to establish their own governments. The conditions
deteriorated to such an exte,1t that even a Mansoor or Haroon could
probably not have succeeded. Motawakkil's murder was the blackest
and the most inauspicious incident of the Abbasid caliphate. Had
Mowaffaq succeeded Motawakkil, he might have possibly controlled
the situation but he did not get a chance to work as the caliph and his
son, Motazid who was ambitions and brave like his father, received
the caliphate when the disease of anarchy had become quite incurable.

Chapter 5

The Caliphate of the Abbasids
(Third Phase)

Motazid Billah
The real name of Motazid Billah bin Mawaffiq Billah bin Motawakkil
Alallah bin Motasim Billah bin Haroon Rasheed was Ahmad. His
kunya was Abu! Abbas. He was born of a slave girl named Sawab in
Rabia Awwal 243 A.H. and after his uncle Motamid Billah he came to
the throne in Rajab 279 A.H. He was a handsome and wise man. He
did not evade strictness and bloodshed if needed. He was careful and
discerning. He was inimical to astrologers and storytellers. Philosophy
had been in vogue since Mamoon' s times. Motazid banned the
publication of books on philosophy and debate in order to avoid
religious strife and conflict that the society had become prone to. He
reduced the taxes on his subjects. He loved justice and protected the
people from being subjected to injustice and tyranny.
The building of Dar An-Nadwah in Makkah had survived until this
time. Motazid had it demolished and built a mosque near the Haram.
The majority of the people who were originally Zoroastrian introduced
celebrating their old holidays and performed certain rites concerning the

506

The History of Islam

lighting of their religious fires in Baghdad. Motazid strictly banned it.
He set up an office of religious affairs and gave money to the poor
religious ascetics. The people prayed for him. He marriEd the
daughter of the Governor of Egypt Khumarwaih bin Ahmad Tuloon.
Once Motazid sent word to Qadi Abu Hazim. "You have managed to
recover a certain persons money from another party. That same party
owes something to me. Please have it returned to me." The Qadi sent
the following reply, "If you present a witness you will also have a
decree in your favor ." Motazid's witnesses refused to stand witness
on his behalf finally the Qadi declared his case void and Motazid the
Caliph could not get back his money. He had come to the throne at a
very critical and bad time in the Abbasid dynasty. He tried his best to
improve the degenerating condition of the Abbasids·. Some signs of
improvement began to be visible but his successors didn't have the
ability to maintain the pace of progress.
Shortly after he came to the throne, Nasr bin Ahmad Samani died and
he was succeeded by his brother Ismail bin Ahmad Samani as the
governor of Mawaraunnahr. Two groups of the Khwarij were at war
in the region of Mousil. The leader of one group Abu Jauzah was
brought to Baghdad in 280 A.H. as a captive. Motazid tortured him to
death. The leader of the other group Haroon Shari remained
rebellious. In 280 A.H., Motazid invaded Jazirah, punished and
disciplined the tribe of Bani Shaiban and returned to Baghdad with a
large quantity of spoils of war.
Motazid appointed his slave Badr as Chief of Police and Obaidulla
-bin Sulaiman bin Wahab his minister in 281 A.H. Motazid caugh
Hamdan bin Hamdoon who had captured the fort of Mardeen an
established a friendship with Haroon Shari. The Caliph then had th
fort leveled to the ground.
In 281 A.H., Caliph Motazid deputed his son Ali, known as Muktafi, t
rule over Rayy, Qazween, Zanjan, Qom and Jadan. In Rabia A wwal 28
A.H., Caliph Motazid arrived near to Mousil and succeeded in destroyin
the Khwarij. He arrested and jailed Haroon and returned to Baghdad
He made a public display of Haroon and had him killed. In 285 A.H., h
invaded Azerbaijan, conquered the fort of Amad, arrested Ahmad bi
Isa bin Sheikh and went back to Baghdad in Rabia Awwal 286 A.H .

507

Qaramata's Revolt
In 281 A.H., one of Qaramat's followers, Yahya bin Mahdi, arrived at
Qateef near Dammam and Bahrain and lodged at Ali bin Moalla bin
Hamdan's house and said, "I have been sent by the Mahdi the leader
of our time. He is about to revolt very soon."
Ali was a Shiite. He collected all the Shiites and read to them the
Mahdi' s letter brought by Yahya. They very sincerely promised to
revolt at the appearance of Mahdi. Then Yahya disappeared for a few
days and when he returned, he presented another letter written by the
Mahdi instructing everyone to pay 36 dinars each to Yahya. The
Shiites at once complied. Yahya again came after a few day,s with a
third letter from the Mahdi instructing them to contribute one fifth of
their money to Yahya.
In 286 A.H., Abu Sayeed Janani went to Bahrain and openly invited
the people to accept Qaramata' s religion. Those who had already
accepted it secretly began to assemble under its flag openly. Abu
Sayeed took all of them to Qateef where he prepared and fully armed
them and set out for Basra. When Motazid was informed of all these
incidents, he wrote to the governor of Basra, Ahmad bin Muhammad
bin Yahya Wasqi, "Have a wall constructed around the city." It was
completed at the cost of 14,000 dinars.
When Abu Sayeed reached the vicinity of Basra, Abbas bin Omar
Ghanwi arrived from the capital Baghdad with 2,000 men to defend
Basra. They fought and Abu Sayeed captured Abbas and the men
with him, his men were thrown into a fire and burnt to ashes. This
occurred in Shaban 287 A.H.
Abu Sayeed Qaramati left Basra after this victory and went to Hajr.
He gave amnesty to the civilians and captured it and then went to
Basra. The people of Basra were extremely terrified. The Gevernor of
the city Ahmad bin Muhammad Wasqi consoled and pacified them.
Abu Sayeed released Abbas from captivity, left Basra and went to
Bahrain. In 288 A.H., a man named Abu! Qasim Yahya, known as
Zikrwaih bin Mehrwaih, went to Kufa. The tribe of Qalees bin
Zamzam bin Adi became inclined to the religion of Qaramata. Slowly

508

The History of Islam

the number of its followers began to multiply.
A chief named Shibi attacked them. The fight saw the arrest of a
commander of Qaramata, Abu! Fawaris. The remainder fled to
Damascus. Shibi sent Abul Fawaris to caliph Motazid in Baghdad who
had him killed. Qaramata went to Damascus to try to win the people
over to him. At the time, the governor of Egypt was Tafaj. He fought
with Qaramata several times and each time the Qaramata was
victorious. This happened in 289 A.H. The remaining details about
Qaramata will follow later in the narrative.
In 286 A.H., Caliph Motazid bestowed on his son Ali, whose future
title was Muktafi, the governorship of Jazirah and Awasim. He
recalled Hasan bin Amr Nasrani and made him his minister.
!

In 288 A.H., Tahir bin Muhammad bin Amr bin Lai th Saffar collected
an army and wanted to capture Iran but Ismail Samani warned him
saying, "If you have a mind to attack this province, I shall come."
Tahir stopped. However, Caliph Motazid's slave Badr conquered Iran.
After the minister Obaidullah bin Sulaiman bin Wahab's death, Caliph
Motazid made his son Abul Qasim the Prime Minister. During Caliph
Motazid regime the Muslims invaded Rome in 285 A.H. and 287 A.H.
Sometimes the Romans were victorious and sometimes the Muslims.

Death of Motazid Billah
In 289 A.H., Caliph Motazid died of overindulgence in sex. He
suffered from a number of diseases. While the doctor was feeling his
pulse, Motazid kicked him so hard that the doctor was l<llocked down
and died. Motazid breathed his last at the same moment.
Motazid was survived by 4 sons and 11 daughters. Motazid died at
the end of Rabia Awwal 289 A.H.

Muktafi Billah
The first name of Muktafi Billah bin Motazid Billah bin Mawaffiq
Billah bin Motawakkil Alallah bin Motasim Billah bin Haroon
Rasheed was Ali and his kunya was Abu Muhammad . He was born of
a Turk slave girl the named Jeejak. There have been only two Caliphs

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

509

bearing the name Ali, one Ali (~) and the other Muktafi Billah.
Motazid Billah had made him his heir-apparent.
When Motazid died, Muktafi was in Riqqah and Badr the slave was in
Iran. Prime Minister Qasim bin Obaidullah took the oath from the
people in the name of Muktafi and sent the information to him in
Riqqah. Muktafi entered Baghdad on 7 Jumad Awwal and gave Prime
Minister Qasim seven royal robes. Muktafi was just, even tempered
and handsome, minister Qasim bin Obaidullah did not want any of
Muktafi's sons to be Caliph Motazid's he wanted somebody else from
the Abbasids to follow Muktafi.
Badr objected and his opposition made the minister give up the idea.
When Muktafi came to the throne, he thought that if Badr informed
the Caliph of his intention, the Caliph would turn against him. He
made a plan to misguide the Caliph before Badr's arrival. He called all
the leaders who were with Badr in Iran. When Badr left Iran and came
to Wasit, the minister sent an army to Wasit. Badr wanted to present
himself to the Caliph and prove his innocence. The minister made the
Caliph extremely angry with Badr and consequently he was killed
before he entered Baghdad.
Badr was very wise, brave and was a good manager. His murder was
unjust like the murder ofHarsima bin Ayun that took place during the
early period of Mamoon Rasheed's caliphate. Muhammad Hamon, a
rebel chief of Ismail Samani, captured Rayy and Caliph Muktafi sent
an army, which was routed by Muhammad bin Hamon. Then Caliph
Muktafi Billah gave authority over Rayy to Ismail Samani and he
captured Rayy. Muhammad Hamon was defeated and fled he was
later captured and Ismail Samani put him in jail where he died in
Shaban 290 A.H.

Qaramata' s Attack on Syria
It has been stated above that

Qaramata and his followers had
captured Bahrain. Then they surfaced in Kufa but they were defeated
there. Qaramata then went to Damascus and repeatedly defeated the
governor of Damascus named Tafaj and then besieged the city.
Qaramata's tyranny in Damascus forced Muktafi Billah to leave

510

The History of Islam

Baghdad and go to Riqqah this occurred in 290 A.H. Commander
Muhammad bin Sulaiman was given an army and sent to Damascus
to punish Qaramata. Muhammad bin Sulaiman fought with Qaramata
valiantly. The commander of Qaramata Abu! Qasim Yahya known as
Zakarrya was caught on 6 Muharram 291 A.H. Many of Qaramata's
men were killed and captured and the rest fled . Zakarrya was brought
as a captive to Muktafi in Riqqah who had him killed .
After Zakarrya' s capture, his brother Husain collected the Qaramata
and created unrest. He was also killed. Husain Qaramati called
himself Amir al-Muminin Mahdi. His cousin Isa chose Mudassir as his
title and gave the impression that the Quranic verse Mudassir referred
to his name. In short, in 291 A.H., all of them were killed one by one
and thus this evil in Syria was put to an end. However, Qaramata
went to Yemen and created trouble there.

The End of Bani Tuloon in Egypt
When Muktafi was free from the war with Qaramata, he left Riqqah
and went to Baghdad . The greater part of Syria was included in the
jurisdiction of Haroon bin Khomarwaih bin Ahmad bin Tuloon.
Neither the Caliph nor Muhammad bin Sulaiman had a mind to fight
with him. The movement of the Caliph and dispatching his forces
were not only for the sake of protecting his government but also for
supporting the king of Egypt, Haroon. Muhammad bin Sulaiman was
originally a working leader of the Tuloon dynasty but due to some
grievance, he went over to the Caliph's side. On the way to Baghdad,
he received a letter from Badr Hamami who was a slave of Haroon
bin Khomarwaih.
Badr Hamami had written: " At th.is time the sultanate of Bani Tuloon
is in a shambles. It has become weak and is disintegrating. If you come
here with your forces and invade Egypt, I am ready to help you with
my men."
Muhammad Sulaiman went to Baghdad with the letter and gave it t
Caliph Muktafi. He gave Muhammad bin Sulaiman an army and sen
him to Egypt. Muhammad Sulaiman reached there and began a chai
of battles.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

511

Badr Hamami sided with Muhammad Sulaiman. Haroon bin
Khomarwaih was killed and Muhammad Sulaiman conquered Egypt.
All the members of Tuloon dynasty were arrested and sent to
Baghdad. This occurred in Safar in 292 A.H. Isa Naushri was made
governor by the Caliph and sent to Egypt. Muhammad bin Sulaiman
handed over the authority to him and returned to Baghdad.
Meanwhile one of the chiefs friendly to Bani Tuloon, general Ibrahim
Khilji dethroned Isa Naushri, and captured Egypt. An army was sent
from Baghdad, which suffered defeat at first but later Ibrahim was
defeated and arrested and sent to jail in Baghdad. The same year the
Caliph gave Mozaffar bin Hajj the Governorship of Yemen and sent
him there to quell the uproar created by Qaramata.

Bani Hamdan
In 292 A.H., Caliph Muktafi gave the governorship of Mousil to Abul
Hija Abdullah bin Hamdan-bin Hamdoon Adwi Taghlibe. He arrived
in Mousil in Muharram 293 A.H. Soon after his arrival, the Kurds
revolted. Abul Hija left Egypt with an army to confront them but was
defeated. He went to Mousil and asked the Caliph for reinforcements.
The army was sent and in Rabia Awwal 294 A.H. Abul Hija .attacked
the Kurds. They were terrified and took refuge in the Saleeq
Mountains. The siege and fighting continued for a long period.
Eventually, the Kurdish leader Muhammad bin Hila! begged for
amnesty, which was granted. Abul Hija established his superior,ity
over the entire province and all the Kurds became obedient, he then
revolted against the caliph. The caliph at this time was Muqtadir, who
sent his servant Munis against him. He arrested Abul Hija and brought
him to Baghdad. He was excused an_d began to live in Baghdad. Abul
Hija and his brother Husain along with their other relatives were then
arrested and sent to jail. They were released in 305 A.H.

Invasions by the Turks and the Romans
In 291 A.H., the Romans with an army of 100,000 invaded the Islamic
territories but they did not succeed. The border commanders put them
to rout. In 293 A.H., a new group of invaders appeared, that is the
Turks who lived in the northern mountains and forests of
Mawaraunnahr. It was the first major attack from this side. The

:

512

The History of Islam

number of these barbaric invaders was staggering.
Ismail Samani, the governor of Mawaraunnahr acted with courage
and perseverance, collected all his forces and taught the invaders a
good lesson. Thousands were killed and arrested and the remainder
escaped. The same year the Romans begged the Muslims for amnesty
and prisoners were exchanged as before. However, soon after this
reconciliation they led a night attack on the city of Quras . Thousands
of Muslims were killed and captured being caught off-guard. They
burnt down the central mosque and returned to Roman territory. The
same year Ismail Samani captured some parts of Delam and the
territories of the Turks by force. In 294 A.H., the Muslims invaded the
Roman territories from Tartoos and captured many Romans including
a Prelate who willingly embraced Islam.

The Death of Muktafi Billah
After ruling for six years and six months Muktafi Billah breathed his
last in Baghdad on Jamad Awwal 295 A.H. and was buried in
Muhammad bin Tahir's house. He had made his brother Jafar his heirapparent before he died. He left 15 million dinars in the treasury at the
time of his death. Jafar bin Motazid was 13. After coming to the
throne, he called himself Muqtadir Billah.

Muqtadir Billah
The real name of Muqtadir Billah bin Motazid Billah was Jafar and his
kunya was Abu! Fadl. He was born of a Roman slave girl Ghuraib.
When Muktafi Billah consulted the people on his heir to the throne just
before his death, they assured him that his brother Muqtadir Billah had
come of age of puberty and only then did he make him his heirapparent. Before this, no Caliph of such a young age had come to the
throne. After his accession, the people began to talk about his
abdication. As Prime Minister, Abbas bin Hasan' s powers were great
and he had been authorized to use the treasury, this caused the
members of the government to be apprehensive. The Prime Minister
was also not pleased at a boy assuming power. He therefore persuaded
Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Motaz to accept the caliphate. While
they were preparing for Muqtadir's abdication and Muhammad

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

513

Motaz' s accession, Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Motaz died. Then
arrangements were made to put Abu! Husain bin Motawakkil on the
throne but he also died. Due to his and Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin
Motaz's deaths, Caliph Muqtadir's position was firmly established.
After sometime, they started gossiping again and the members of the
government wanted to persuade Abdullah bin Motaz to accept the
caliphate. He agreed to it provided there should be no bloodshed and
all the members of the government also agreed to it. However, Prime
Minister Abbas bin Hasan did not agree to it. On 20 Rabia Awwal 296
A.H. while the Prime Minister was going to his garden, he was
suddenly attacked and killed. The next day the deposition of
Muqtadir was announced and the oath for Abdullah bin Motaz took
place. At that time, Caliph Muqtadir was playing polo. Having heard
about his deposition, he went to his palace and closed the doors.
Soori after coming to the throne Abdullah bin Motaz chose AlcMurtaza
Billah as his title and wrote to Muqtadir, "You will be safe if you leave
the capital and give up the desire for the caliphate." Muqtadir replied: "I
gladly agree to what you say but give me time until this evening."
At night, the servant Munis consulted other servants on how to create
a disturbance. When Husain bin Hamdan came to the palace door in
the morning, they showered arrows on him. They continued doing
this until the evening. At night, others began to join Muqtadir's group.
As a consequence, the new Caliph, Abdullah bin Motaz, along with
some of his supporters had to go into hiding. Muqtadir then
appointed Abul Hasan bin Forat as Prime Minister. Abdullah bin
Mutaz was arrested and killed .
The same year in Rabia Thani 296 A.H., the oath for Obaidullah
Mahdi took place in Africa and thus the Obadiah (Fatimid) dynasty
was founded and the Aghlab dynasty came to an end in North Africa.

The Origin of the Obadiah (Fatimid) Dynasty
The first ruler Obaidullah Mahdi claimed to be the son of Muhammad
bin Jafar bin Muhammad bin Ismail bin Jafar Sadiq. The Abbasids
questioned his lineage. He in fact was originally a Zoroastrian and
some have called him a Christian.

514

The History of Islam

The well-known judge, Qadi Abu Bakr Baqillani, has refuted
Obaidullah Mahdi's claim to be from the Prophet's family or to being
of a high lineage. During Caliph Qahir Billah's regime when the
question of his lineage was under consideration, renowned scholars
clearly denounced Obaidullah Mahdi's claim to be an Alawiite. These
scholars include Abu! Abbas Abyuzah, Abu Hamid Asfaraini and
Abu }afar Nasfi Qudoori. Among the Alawiites Murtada Ibn Bathawi
and Ibn Azraq have also called him a fraud in his claim. He was a
Shiite however, the scholars of the Shiites have rebutted his claim to
be an Alawi. Furthermore, Abu Abdullah Ibn Noman has also called
him a liar in his claim to be an Alawi. The chief of the historians
Sheikh Jalaluddin Suyuti has very emphatically proved him to be false
in his claim to be of a well-known family. He has proved him to be of
Zoroastrian heritage.
However, a very great scholar of history, Ibn Khaldoon has attempted
to prove him to be an Alawiite. In both his introduction to history and
in his history book Ibn Khaldoon has given recognition to his claim of
noble lineage. However, the arguments he has offered in this respect
are very weak and in view of his status as a greet historian, are very
unusual. He writes," A great dynasty was established in Obaidullah's
family. Had he not been an Alawi, the people would not have
recognized his leadership and given away their heads under his flag ."
Offering such arguments as proof of someone's noble birth is certainly
not scientific and the reality is that he has not given even a single
proof in this respect. As he hinZself was a West Acrican, naturally he
does not like a western ruler to be discredited. Similarly, he exerts much
effort to prove the sultanate of Idrisids of Morocco to be Alawi. He tries
his level best to prove Idris II to be son of Idris I and unnecessarily
brings into discussion the chastity of a Berber woman. The
misunderstanding may possibly be a sin against the Imam in question.
With the beginning of Abbasid caliphate the Alwis antagonistic
activities began against the administration. The Alwis rose again and
again and every time they met with failure. Abdullah bin Saba, the
Jew had sown the seed of discord among the people and conspiracies
against the administration.V1eir nefarious plan was aiqed and abetted
by the Magi, Jews, Berbers etc. who were carrying out their activities

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

515

in the garb of neo-Muslims. And when Abbasid dynasty showed signs
of weakness some Jews and Magis tried to present themselves as
Alwis to benefit from the flowing situation. Since Berber territories
were far distant from Baghdad, the centre of power due advantage
could be taken of their inherent nature. Thus, a person named
Muhammad Habib who lived at Salmia in Homs towards the end of
the third century Hajara came on the scene as one descending from
Imam J'afar Sadiq's elder son Isma'il. He tried to cash in on his relation
with the Imam. Right from his time Imam }'afar Sadiq's influence had
spread throghout Yemen~Africa and Morocco. He used all his means,
devices and force to turn the people to expect the arrival of Imam
Mahdi in immediate future who were to be from among theAlwi
Fatimi. Habib sent one of his confidants Rustam bin Hasan bin Hosab
to Yemen to convince people of the arrival of Imam Mahdi in near
future . He performed his duty with utmost care and tact.
Following this a man named Abu Abdullah Hasan bin Muhammad
bin Zakariya, a Shi'ite by faith, and a staunch support of the Alwis came
to Habib. He found him promising and sent him, after necessary
instructions, to keep company with Rustam.bin Hasan for a few days
and learn from him the art of preaching and then go to Berber
territories to perform his duty. Muhammad Habib had also told Abu
Abdullah that his son, Ubaidullah was Imam Mahdi and that he was
being sent as one inviting people towards him. Abu Abdullah arrived
in Yemen, took lesson in preaching and reached Makk.ah in Hajj season.
There he sought out the caravan of the Hajjis from Katama and
became friendly with them. Observing how pious he was they revered
and served him.
Whe~ they set out towards Africa after the Hajj, he accompanied
them. They took it as an auspicious sign. Reaching Katama, they had a
house built for him on Mount Ankajan, which they called Fajjul
Akhyar. Abu Abdullah drowned himself in prayer and many visitors
came to him eagerly. He told them that the Mahdi was about to
appear and that he was instructed by him to stay in Katama and he
had told him that his supporters would be from there. Gradually Abu
Abdullah's government and leadership became established irt
Katama.

516

The History of Islam

When the news reached Ibrahim bin Ahmad bin Aghlab, the Governor
of North Africa, at the capital Qairwan, he wrote to the ruler of Melah
to give him a report about Abu Abdullah. He wrote back that he was
an ascetic and instructed the people to perform their prayers and
observe fast. Ibrahim was silent after hearing this. After a few days
Abu Abdullah armed and fortified his group and invaded Melah city,
expelled the governor and captured it. Ibrahim bin Aghlab then gave
an army to his son Ahwal and sent him to Melah. Abu Abdullah
suffered defeat and fled to Katama and took refuge on Mount
Ankajan. Ahwal left for Qairwan.
Meanwhile the ruler of North Africa, Ibrahim bin Ahmad died. His
son Abul Abbas then succeeded to the throne. Abu Abdullah founded
and populated a city named Darul Hajarah. Ahwal went to mount
Ankajan to punish him. Meanwhile Abu! Abbas died and his son
Zeyadatullah came to the throne.
Zeyadatullah recalleq. Ahwal and killed him on some false pretext.
Abu Abdullah continued to increase his power. He sent a delegation
of people from Katama to Obaidullah Mahdi in Homs where he was
staying. He briefed him about his victories and asked him to come to
North Africa.
Some spies informed Caliph Muktafi Billah of the arrival of the
delegation carrying the said message. He at once issued a warrant for
the arrest of Obaidullah and wrote to the Egyptian governor Isa
Naushri (then Governor of Egypt after the downfall of the Tuloons) to
arrest him. [This has also been taken by lbn Khaldoon as a proof of
Obaidullah being a Sayed (from the Prophet's family), indicating that
if he had not been of the Prophet's family, the caliph would not have
given orders for his arrest. This is another very weak proof, any
government would arrest those who desired to over throw their rule
and it is not evidence as to the heritage of any conspirator.] The rulers
of the Aghlab dynasty recognized the leadership of the Abbasid
caliphate and read the name of the Abbasid Caliph in the Friday
sermons. They bordered Egypt so how could Muktafi stand the creation
of any major disturbance in North Africa with out responding?
Obaidullah left Homs with his son and his supporters. He disguised
himself as a merchant and joined a commercial caravan. He was

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

517

caught in Egypt but Naushri released him based on incomplete
information. He passed through Egypt and entered North Africa.
Zeyadatullah's spies were after him but he managed to conceal himself
from them until he reached Sijilmassa. The administrator of the place
caught him and jailed him along with his son. Zeyadatullah was
drowned in debauchery and neglected state administration and
consequently Abu Abdullah the Shiite's power continued to increase
and nothing was done to deter him. When Zeyadatullah saw that
Abu Abdullah the Shiite had captured the major parts of North
Africa and continued to do so, he collected a huge army and sent it to
punish him.
Abu Abdullah could not stand the pressure of such a huge army and
climbed up the peak of a high mountain. He remained besieged there
for six months. In the seventh month, he led a successful night attack
on the North African army and put it to rout and then began to
conquer city after city. Zeyadatullah then sent another commander to
fight against him but he was defeated. Then in 295 A.H. after making
special arrangements, he sent his armies and Generals to discipline
Abu Abdullah however, he had already established his power. For a
year the chain of battles continued. Sometimes Abu Abdullah was
defeated and sometimes he defeated the African army. During this
period, Abu Abdullah's group kept multiplying and people kept on
joining him while Zeyadatullah' s army was becoming smaller. One
city after another continued to come under Abu Abdullah' s control
until Zeyadatullah's army commanders started joining him. Urwah
bin Yusuf and Hasan bin Abi Khazir joined him and were appointed
to important posts. In Rajab 296 A.H., Abu Abdullah captured the
capital Qairwan and put Zeyadatullah to rout and let the people of
Katama stay in the royal palaces. Then he invaded Sijilmassa, defeated
the Governor Yasa' bin Madar, captured and killed him. He then took
Obaidullah Mahdi out of the jail and put him on a horse and went to
the army camp declaring to all, "This is your leader", referring to the
Mahdi. He then left and came to the city of Rafadah. Abu Abdullah
and all others took the oath for Obaidullah and called him Al-Mahdi
Amir al-Muminin. This oath took place in the last ten days of Rabia
Thani 296 A.H. and it marks the beginning of the Obadiah dynasty
(Fatimids).

518

The History of Islam

Soon after corning to the throne, Obaidullah Mahdi sent his
rruss1onaries to every corner of the territory. Those who refused to
accept his religion were killed. He gave feudal estates and important
posts to the people of Katama. He sent Hasan bin Abi Khazir to Sicily
as its ruler. He reached there on 10 Thul Hijjah 297 A.H. and made all
the subjects of the island hate him because of his tyranny.
He began to appoint governors and administrators in the whole of
North Africa . In 299 A.H., the people of Sicily sent a letter to
Obaidullah Mahdi complaining against Hasan bin Ahmad bin Abi
Khazir. He sent Ali bin Omar as Governor in his place. The civilians
were displeased with him too. They deposed him and chose Ahmad
bin Mohib as their leader. Ahmad bin Mohib induced the people to
obey the Abbasid Caliph Muqtadir Billah. He expunged Mahdi's
name from the Friday sermon and entered Mugtadir's name in its
place and sent a war fleet to the North African coast.
Obaidullah Mahdi sent a war fleet under Husain bin Ali bin Khazir's
command to defend the coast. The fleets clashed and lbn Khazir
had killed and Obaidullah Mahdi's fleet was destroyed by the ships
from Sicily.
When the news reached Baghdad, Caliph Muqtadir dispatched black
robes and flags to Ahmad bin Mohib and for one year the name of the
Abbasi.cl Caliph was read in the Friday sermon in Sicily. Obaidullah,
Mahdi prepared a powerful war fleet and sent it to Sicily, which broke
Ahmad bin Mohib's power. The people of Sicily arrested him and sent
him along with his men to Obaidullah Mahdi and he begged for
forgiveness . Obaidullah Mahdi ordered Ahmad bin Mohib and his men
to be taken to lbn Khazir grave and killed. This occurred in 300 A.H.

The Oath for the Heir to the Throne
In 301 A.H., Muqtadir declared as heir to the thrope his 4-year-old son
Abul Abbas first with his title Qahir Billah. He then made him
Governor of Egypt and the Western territories and sent him to Egypt
under tutelage of his servant Munis.
The same year Hasan bin Ali bin Husain bin Ali bin Omer bin Ali bin
Husain bin Ali bin Abi Talib who was known as Atroosh, captured the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

519

province of Tabristan. Atroosh worked hard inviting the people of
Tabristan and Delam to Islam, the people of these regions embraced
Islam by virtue of his sermons and this increased his power until he
was able to captured Tabristan.
Atroosh was a Shiite by religion and those who became Muslims due
to his efforts took it as their faith. The administrators of Khorasan
invaded Tabristan and killed Atroosh in 304 A.H.
In 302 A.H ., Obaidullah Mahdi sent his General Khafasha Katami to
invade Alexandria. Munis who had already reached Egypt fought
against him. After several fierce battles, Mahdi's army retreated and
fled back to their territory losing 7,000 men.
In 307 A.H., Obaidullah Mahdi gave a big army to his son Abul Qasim
and sent him to launch 1n attack on Egypt. In suffered defeat at the
hands of Munis he returned after many of their commanders were
captured.
The same year the Roman king made peace with Muqtadir Billah and
in order to strengthen the ties of friendship sent his ambassadors to
Baghdad for whose reception grand arrangements were made. In 308
A.H., Obaidullah's army captured a part of Egypt.

Qaramata's Upheaval in Iraq
A group of Qaramata's followers had taken possession of Bahrain as
has been stated above. One night in 311 A.H., Qaramata's commander
Abu Tahir Sulaiman bin Abi Sayeed Janani, supported by 1,700 men,
invaded Basra. By putting ladders against the walls of the city they
climbed over them killed the guards, opened the city gate and began a
general massacre.
When the Governor of Basra, Subuk Muflihi, got the news, he came
out to face him but was killed by Qaramata. Abu Tahir captured
Basra, stayed there for 17 days, looted cash and goods, captured
women and children and left for Hajar on the 18th day. Caliph
Muqtadir heard about this disaster, gave the letter of Governorship to
Muhammad bin Abdullah Farooqi and sent him there. Muhammad
bin Abdullah reached there after Abu Tahir had left.

520

The History of Islam

In 312 A.H., Abu Tahir took an army and looted the caravans of the
pilgrims returning from Makkah and captured Abu! Hija bin
Hamdani and Muqtadir Billah's maternal uncle Ahmad bin Badr who
were with those caravans.
He released them after a few days and demanded the city of Ahwaz.
When Caliph Muqtadir refused, Abu Tahir re-started looting the
caravans. He sent an army, which was defeated by Abu Tahir. He
chased them up to Kufa and after capturing it, stayed there for six
days and returned to Hajar with a huge quantity of cash and goods.
No one dared to perform Hajj for fear of Qaramata in 313 A.H. In 314
A.H., Caliph Muqtadir recalled Yusuf bin Abu Saj from Azerbaijan
and made him the ruler of the eastern countries and asked him to fight
against Abu Tahir and the Qaramata. There was no confrontation that
year. In Ramadan 315 A.H., Abu Tahir along with his army went to
Kufa. Yusuf left Wasit to save Kufa but Abu Tahir reached Kufa a day
earlier and captured it. Yusuf came and started a battle. His army was
defeated by Abu Tahir and retreated. Yusuf was wounded and
captured. Abu Tahir deputed a physician for his treatment.
When the news reached Baghdad, Caliph sent Munis. Abu Tahir had
left for Ain Tamr before Munis reached there. Abu Tahir left Kufa,
captured Ambar and put the army to rout. Finally, Nasr Hajib left
Baghdad, joined Munis and with 40,000 soldiers attacked the Qaramata
but they were defeated. Abu Tahir killed Yusuf who was in captivity.
This defeat sent shock waves throughout Baghdad. The people began
to leave for safer places. In the beginning, Abu Tahir left Ambar,
looted Rahba and for one day and one night, he declared the killings
of the people of Rahba as lawful.
The inhabitants of Qarqisya watched the horrible sight of the massacre
and begged for amnesty, which was granted by Abu Tahir. He then
sent military units to various areas to launch night attacks. After three
days· of continued fighting, he conquered Riqqah and was firmly
established in the province of Jazirah. Armies left Baghdad to fight
with him but in vain.
In 316 A.H., Qaramata went to Hajar. Then after a few days, they
caused terror in Sawad, Wasit and Ain Tamr. Caliph Muqtadir

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

521

deputed Haroon bin Ghuraib, Safi Basri and Ibn Qais to punish them.
Qaramata's groups were vanquished and they fled and peace was
restored there.

Roman Tyranny
In 314 A.H., the Romans conquered Lamtiyah. In 315 A.H., they
captured Dimyat, plundered the city and had the horn sounded in the
central mosque (the horn being and insult). The same year the
inhabitants of Delam invaded Rayy and Gibal and killed thousands of
men, the Romans captured Khalat, removed the place for giving the
sermon from the grand mosque and put a cross in its place and made
it into a Church.

Deposition and Restoration of Muqtadir
In 317 A.H., Munis alias Muzaffar deposed Muqtadir. Muqtadir
wanted to appoint Haroon bin Ghuraib Hajib in place of Munis. When
Munis found out, he took an army and most of the members of the
government and invaded the palace, arrested Muqtadir and installed
as caliph Muhammad bin Muqtadir with the title Qahir Billah.
Everyone took the oath for his Caliphate and the Governors were duly
informed by letter.
The next day the army created a scene because of a delay in their
reward money. They went to Munis's house in search of Muqtadir,
bringing him out they put him on their shoulders and took him to the
palace and brought Qahir Billah to him under arrest. Seeing him
Muqtadir said, "Don't be afraid. You were not at fault." The people
were pacified. Then Governors were again informed that Muqtadir
Billah was the Caliph as before. Muqtadir pleased them by bestowing
on them gifts and honor.

Qaramata' s Atrocities in Makkah
Qaramata's rule in Bahrain was firmly established. Their commander
was Abu Tahir. They read the name of Obaidullah Mahdi, the ruler of
Africa, in their Friday sermon and recognized him as their caliph. In
318 A.H., Abu Tahir went to Makkah with his army during the season

/

The History of Islam

of Hajj. Mansoor Delami was sent as leader of the pilgrimage from
Baghdad. He reached Makkah safely on 8 Thul Hijjah. Abu Tahir
arrived on 9 Thul Hijjah and immediately after his arrival began to
slay the Hujjaj and loot their belongings.
i

I

He did not hesitate in killing people even inside the holy sanctuary of
the Ka'bah and threw the dead bodies in the well of Zamzam, removed
the Black Stone from the wall of the Ka'bah and broke its door.
Muhammad bin Rabi bin Sulaiman says: "I was present in Makkah
during the disaster. I saw a man climb on the roof of the Ka'bah to
pull down the arch. I said, 0 Allah! I cannot stand the sight. That
man's feet slipped he fell down and died instantly." Abu Tahir looted
the people of Makkah for 11 days, loaded the black stone on a camel
and started for Hajr (the capital of Bahrain). 40 camels one after
another died carrying the black stone between Makkah and Hajr. It
remained under Qaramata' s possession for 22 years. He was offered
50,000 dinars for it but he would not part with it.
At the end of Motiullah's caliphate, the black stone was taken back from
him and set in the Ka'bah again. On the return journey, only a single
camel carried it from Hajr to Makkah. When these atrocities and
desecrations were narrated to the ruler of North Africa, Obaidullah he
wrote a denunciatory letter to Abu Tahir and insisted the return the
goods to the Makkans. Abu Tahir returned part of the goods but he did
not return the black stone. It was not put back in its place until 339 A.H.

Murder of Muqtadir Billah
Munis captured Mousil in Safar 320 A.H and put to rout Sayeed and
Dawood the sons of Abdullah bin Hamdan and their nephew
Nasiruddaulah Husain bin Abdullah bin Hamdan who were sent to
defend Mousil . Then the armies of Baghdad, Syria and Egypt joined
Munis because the soldiers were pleased with his generous gifts.
Nasiruddaulah bin Abdullah bin Hamdan joined Munis and stayed
with him in Mousil. Nine days after the conquest of Mousil, Munis
invaded Baghdad. Intense dissention arose between him and the
ministers of the government.
After being defeated Sayeed bin Abdullah went to Baghdad. At the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

523

receipt of the news of Munis's attack, armies under the commands of
chiefs like Sayeed bin Abdullah bin Hamdan, Abu Bakr Muhammad
bin Yaqut and others were sent. When Munis's army approached, the
defending soldiers ran back to Baghdad. Without an army, the
commanders also went back to Baghdad. Munis reached Baghdad and
stayed at one of the city's gates known as Shamasyah. Both sides built
fortifications and the battle began. Muqtadir came out and stood on a
hillock and the army was fighting in front of him.
The Baghdad army suffered defeat. The Caliph's companions said to
him. "Please don't stand in this place. Let us go back." He started to
go but was surrounded by a group of Berbers who had joined Munis's
army. One of the Berbers shot an arrow that hit Muqtadir. He fell off
the horse and the same Berber rushed forward and chopped off his
head. He was stripped naked and his body was left there and his head
was taken to Munis on the point of a spear. This took place on
Tuesday 27 Shawwal 320 A.H.
Munis put Abu Mansoor Muhammad bin Motazid on the throne and
chose for him the title Qahir Billah. Ali bin Maqlah was made the
minister and Ali bin Baleeq was appointed Hajib. Muqtadir's mother
was arrested and forced to part with her money then she was beaten
to death. In this way, money was collected from the people by force .

Qahir Billah
Qahir Billah bin Motazid Billah bin Mawaffiq Billah bin Motawakkil
was born of a slave-girl named Fitnah. His name was Muhammad and
his kunya was Abu Mansoor.
After the murder of Caliph Muqtadir, his son Abdul Wahid along
with Haroon bin Ghuraib, Muhammad bin Yaqut and Ibrahim bin
Raiq had gone to Madain. He came to Ahwaz via Wasit and Sus.
Qahir Billah gave an army to Ali bin Baleeq and sent it to arrest Abdul
Wahid and his men.
Consequently, through the efforts of the army commanders and
through correspondence Abdul Wahid and his men begged Munis
and Qahir Billah for amnesty, which was readily granted and they all
went to Baghdad.

524

The History of Islam

The Caliph made Muhammad bin Yaqut his companion which was
disliked by the minister Ali bin Maqla. He misguided Munis by telling
his that Muhammad bin Yaqut had been trying to ruin him. Munis
ordered Baleeq and his son Ali bin Baleeq that caliph to be kept under
constant surveillance. Even women visiting the Caliph's palace were
body-searched and basically no one was allowed to enter the palace.
When the caliph realized that he was under surveillance and rendered
powerless, he started conspiring with some army chiefs against Munis.
Munis and his supporters began to make preparations to depose the
Caliph and make Abu Ahmad bin Muktafi the caliph. Qahir Billah
succeeded in his attempts. Ali bin Baleeg and Munis were arrested
and killed. Muhammad bin Yaqut and Abu Jafar Muhammad bin
Qasim bin Obaidullah were appointed Hajib and minister
respectively. This happened in Shaban 321 A.H.
During the same period, they started looking for Ahmad bin Muktafi
who had gone into hiding. He was eventually arrested and buried
alive in a wall. The houses of the dead were razed to the ground and
their belongings confiscated. After ruling for three and a half months
as minister, Abu Jafar was censured and jailed. He died after 18 days
in captivity.

The Origin of the Buwayhid Dynasty
As the members of the Buwayhid dynasty are going to be mentioned
repeatedly in connection with the Abbasid caliphs, it is pertinent to
record the early history of this dynasty. Mention of Atroosh, Hasan
bin Ali Zainul Abedeen has already been made. Following
Muhammad bin Zaid Alawi's death, Atroosh went to Delam and
preached Islam to the people there and continued this missionary
work continuously for 13 years in Delam, Tabristan and Egypt and he
induced many of them to embrace Islam.
During that time, the ruler of Delam was Hassan. He tried to stop the
growing influence of Atroosh but to no avail. Atroosh had mosques
built and had the people act upon the Islamic tenets and started
collecting taxes. Finally, he formed a body of the converts and armed
them. They invaded Qazween and Saloos the border cities, invited the
people to Islam and admitted them into the lslamic fold.

Ii

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

525

The state of Tabristan was a part of the Samani territory. The Samani
ruler of Tabristan began to oppress the people. Atroosh goaded the
people of Delam to launch an offensive against Tabristan. In 301 A.H .,
Atroosh formed an army of the Delam people and attacked Tabristan
and put to rout the ruler Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Salook and
captured Tabristan.
After Atroosh, his son-in-law Hasan bin Qasim and his descendants
captured and ruled over Tabristan, Jurjan, Saryah Amud and
Usturabad. Their army commanders were all from Delam. Among
them was Lail bin Noman whom Hasan bin Qasim had appointed the
ruler of Jurjan. Lail bin Noman was killed while fighting with the
Samanis in 309 A.H. After that, the Samanis led several offensives
against Bani Atroosh. Those attacks were repulsed by Surkhab, a
Delami general, who lost his life in the battle. Surkhab's uncle Makan
Ibn Kane Delami ruled over Usturabad on behalf of Bani Atroosh.
Makan collected round him his compatriots from Delam and formed
and army and brought Jurjan under his control. One of the Delamis
who helped him was the famous chief Asfar bin Shairwaih Delami.
Makan set up an independent government and annexed major parts
of Tabristan. He got angry with Shairwaih on some issues and
expelled him. He then went to Bakr bin Muhammad bin Yasi in
Nishapur who was the ruler there on behalf of the Samanis.
Bakr bin Muhammad gave Asfar an army and sent him to conquer
Jurjan. Makan lived in Tabristan and his brother Abu! Hasan bin Kani
was made the ruler there. Abu Ali bin Atroosh was also there and he
had no territory to rule over. One day Abu Ali had a deadly
opportunity and killed Abu! Hasan and the Delami army, which was
stationed at Jurjan, took the oath for Abu Ali. Abu Ali then deputed
Ali bin Khursheed Delami as ruler of Jurjan.
At this time, Asfar with an army from the Samanis reached near to
Jurjan. Ali bin Khursheed wrote to Asfar: "Instead of invading us why
don't you join us and attack Makan who is in Tabristan? Asfar sought
Bakr bin Muhammad's permission and he agreed .
When Makan bin Kani found out, he took an army from Tabristan and
marched to Jurjan. Ali bin Khursheed and Asfar put up a joint

526

The History of Islam

resistance and put him to rout and captured Tabristan. Shortly after
that both Ali bin Khursheed and Abu Ali bin Atroosh died and Asfar
ruled over Tabristan without facing any resistance. Makan took this
opportunity and attacked Asfar and gained control over Tabristan.
Asfar went to Bakr bin Muhammad in Jurjan.
When Bakr bin Muhammad died in 315 A.H., the Samani ruler
deputed Asfar to administrate Jurjan. Among Asfar's commanders
was Mardawih whom he gave an army and sent him to invade
Tabristan. Makan arrayed his forces but lost the battle and Mardawih
captured Tabristan. Makan fled and went to Atroosh's son-in-law,
Hasan bin Qasim in Rayy.
Having gained control over Tabristan and Jurjan, Asfar introduced in
the Friday sermon the name of the ruler of Khorasan and
Mawaraunnahr, Nasr bin Ahmad bin Saman. Then he went to Rayy
and liberated it. Makan became a landless and went to the mountains
of Tabristan. Asfar's rule over the provinces of Rayy, Qazween,
Zanjan, Abharqam and Karkh was firmly established and he governed
this vast territory very successfully. Asfar decided to be an
independent ruler so he revolted against the Samani King and
declared his independence.
Hearing this Caliph Muqtadir gave an army to Haroon bin Ghuraib
and sent him to take these territories from Asfar but Haroon was
defeated. Then Nasr bin Ahmad Samani left Bukhara with an army to
punish Asfar. Asfar begged to be excused and promised to pay the
taxes. Nasr granted his petition for amnesty and allowed him to retain
the Province of Rayy while Nasr returned to Bukhara.

I

Mardawih, one of Asfar' s commanders persuaded other commanders
to join him and rebel. He killed Asfar, annexed Harnadan and Isfahan
and began to rule over that territory. He called Makan bin Kani and
deputed him to govern Tabristan and Jurjan. Then he deposed Makan.
Makan went to Delam, collected a group of fighters and invaded
Tabristan but was defeated by Mardawih and he fled to Nishapur.

i

In 319 A.H ., Mardawih decided to secure the recognition of his
conquered territories from the Abbasid Caliph. He therefore sent an
application to the Caliph's court to grant him the letter o

The Caliphate of the Abbas ids (Third Phase)

527

governorship of the territories he held in exchange for the payment of
two hundred thousand dinars annually. The Caliph granted the
application and sent the letter of authorization and gave him another
landed estate on his own accord. In 320 A.H., Mardawih called his
brother Dashmagir from Gilan. In Dashmagir' s territory Abu Shuja
Buwayh's three sons were in charge of the boats in that area and it is
because of them that these details are being given.
Abu Shuja Buwayh Delami was.a very poor fisherman. He eked out
his living by catching fish. One night he dreamed that he squatted
down to urinate and a flame came out of his penis, which spread and
lit the whole world. He interpreted that his descendents would be
kings of the area covered by the light. Then three sons were born to
him Ali, Hasan and Ahmad. Because these three brothers made much
progress later· on and chose for their titles Imaduddaulah,
Ruknuddaulah and Muizzuddaulah and became respectable rulers,
some linked their lineage to the King of Iran, Yazd Jurd and some
called them the descendents of Bahram Gaur. People generally try to
attach wealth and kingship to nobility of birth and sycophants
generally prove most useful in connecting power to an impressive
family tree.
The act of the three sons of Buwayh the fisherman acquiring wealth
and becoming rulers and then linking their lineage to the Iranian kings
is not unusual but their real origins are as stated.
When Makan bin Kani recruited the inhabitants of Delam into his
army, Buwayh's three sons were amongst them. When Makan met
with failure, most of his men went over to Mardawih. Mardawih
granted them great honor and appointed them to higher posts than
they really deserved, Buwayh's three sons also benefited from this. By
virtue of their service, alertness and skill they endeared themselves to
him, Mardawih deputed Ali bin Buwayh to rule over Karkh. His
younger brothers Hasan and Ahmad also went with him. At that time,
Rayy was ruled over by Mardawih's brother Dashmagir. Dashmagir
had made Husain bin Muhammad known as Umaid his minister.
When Ali bin Buwayh arrived in Rayy, he called on Umaid and
presented him with a mule. Then he went to Karkh and began to rule.
When Mardawih was informed of the meeting between Ali bin

528

The HistonJ of Islam

Buwayh and Umaid and the presentation of the mule, a doubt crossed
his mind thinking that the chiefs coming from Makan, who were given
good posts and made rulers of cities, might conspire against him and
become a problem. Therefore, he wrote to his brother Dashmagir to
arrest all those who came from Makan and who were assigned to
govern the cities there. Some were arrested but Ali bin Buwayh who
had occupied Karkh was not arrested for fear of possible riots.

i I

'

Ali bin Buwayh captured several forts in the vicinity of Karkh and
whatever money and goods he collected in booty he distributed
among his soldiers. This endeared him to them. Respect for him and
his influence began to rise. In 321 A.H., Mardawih released all those
who were under house arrest in Rayy. All of them went to Ali bin
Buwayh in Karkh and he honored them.
During the same period a Delami chief, Sherzad, along with a group
visited Ali bin Buwayh and induced him to invade Isfahan. When
Mardawih found out that all the Delamis had gathered around Ali bin
Buwayh, he wrote to send him all the chiefs who had been released .
Ali bin Buwayh refused to comply with the order and began to make
preparations to invade Isfahan in coalition with Sherzad. Isfahan was
being ruled over by Mozaffar bin Yaqut and Abu Ali bin Rustam. Both
of them were angry with the Caliph and had rebelled against him.
Ali bin Buwayh invaded Isfahan and put Mozaffar bin Yaqut to rout.
Abu Ali bin Rustam died and Ali bin Buwayh gained control over
Isfahan. This news plunged Mardawih into a deep anxiety because by
then Ali bin Buwayh's power had grown considerably. He sent his
brother Dashrnagir with an army to Isfahan to punish and discipline
Ali bin Buwayh. After receiving this information, Ali left Isfahan and
captured Jurjan. This occurred in Thul Hijjah 321 A.H.
Dashrnagir captured Isfahan but then handed over Isfahan to
Mozaffar bin Yaqut to govern it. Ali bin Buwayh sent his brother
Hasan to Gazroon to collect the taxes. He came across Muzaffar bin
Yaqut's army on way and defeated it. He collected the taxes and
returned to his brother.
Ali bin Buwayh set out towards Astakhar. Ibn Yaqut chased him wit!
a big army and challenged him to fight. They fought and Ali bin

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

529

Buwayh's brother Ahmad showed extraordinary valor. Muzaffar bin
Yaqut lost and retreated to Wasit. Ali bin Buwayh came to Shiraz and
captured it and the whole of Iran came under his control. The soldiers
whose number had now considerably increased demanded their
salaries. Ali did not have enough money to meet their requirements.
In a pensive mood, he lay down on the roof of a house. A snake fell off
the roof. He ordered the house to be pulled down. When they started
demolishing it, boxes full of gold were found . He distributed all the
gold among his soldiers. He sent for a tailor to have some new clothes
made. The guards brought a tailor who thought he was being
arrested. Immediately he said, "I have nothing except a few boxes that
I am holding for someone and I have not opened them and do not
know their contents." Those boxes were brought and they were found
to contain gold coins. Ali bin Buwayh confiscated them too. All this
wealth had been left by Muzaffar bin Yaqut who could not carry it
with him. By luck during the same period, he discovered the
accumulated treasure of the kings_of the Saffar Dynasty, which totaled
five hundred thousand red dinars.
During the same period, one day he was riding on horseback and the
horse's legs sank into the ground. He had the horse's legs dug out and
a treasure was found there. In this way, he accumulated a huge
treasury and began to rule over Iran very successfully and continued
increasing his power rivaling Mardawih and he became a s.o urce of
great danger for him.

Over Throw of Qahir
Qahir Billah was a killer, hasty, a chronic drunk and a man of
mercurial nature. He had clamped a total ban on drinking and selling
of wine. After ruling for one and a half years he was arrested by
military rioters on 6 Jumad Thani 322 A.H., they put Abu! Abbas
Muhammad bin Muqtadir on the throne and gave him the title of Radi
Billah. Immediately after assuming power, Radi Billah had Qahir
Billah blinded.
According to Ali bin Muhammad Khorasani, one day Qahir Billah
came to me with a spear in his hand and asked me to describe to him
the habits and nature of every Caliph of the Abbasids. I said, "Saffah

was quick to spill blood and his governors followed in his footsteps.
He was a brave and believed in collecting taxes. Mansoor was the first
to sow the seed of dissention between the Banu Abbas and the family
of Abi Talib and did not let them remain as one. He was the first to
have made the astrologers his companions. Suryani and non-Arabic
books like geometry, Kalilah Dimnah and books in Greek were
translated for him. Mahdi was very generous and a just man and
~hatever his father had seized from the people, he returned it to
them. He had the apostates killed and rebuilt mosques on the three
holy sites in Makkah, Madinah and Jerusalem. Hadi was a tyrant and
proud and his governors followed suit. Haroon Rasheed fought the
Romans and performed Hajj, he had rest houses and water tanks
constructed on the way to Madinah, populated Tartoos, Masisah and
Marash and he pleased the people. He was the first among the caliphs
who played polo, chess and enjoyed shooting. Ameen was generous
and tolerant but was drowned in pleasures. Mamoon was overwhelmed by astrology and philosophy. He was generous and wise.
Motasim was the same and was fond of horseback riding and imitating
the non-Arab kings. He fought in battles and had many conquests to
his credit. Wathiq followed his father's life style. Motawakkil went
against Mamoon, Motaism and Wathiq. He was against their beliefs
and ordered the opposing scholars to be given the opportunity to
speak on these subjects and the people were generally pleased with
him." Qahir continued to ask about the other Caliphs and I kept
telling him about them. He was very pleased to hear their history.

Radi Billah
The name of Radi Billah bin Muqtadir Billah was Muhammad and his
kunya was Abul Abbas. He was born of a Roman slave girl named
Zaloom. He was enthroned on Jumad Thani 322 A.H . following the
deposition of Qahir. He was brought from the jail and put on the
throne. He appointed Ali bin Maqlah as his Prime Minister. H e
arrested Muhammad bin Yagut and imprisoned him. His father,
Yaqut was in Wasit at that time. He arrayed his forces and went to
fight against Ali bin Buwayh but lost. The same year Obaidullah
Mahdi, the ruler of North Africa, died after ruling for 25 years. He
was succeeded by his son Abul Qasim with the title Biarnrillah.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

531

Murder of Mardawih
As stated above, Mardawih captured the province of Rayy, Isfahan,
and Ahwaz and obtained the documents authorizing him from the
Caliph's court. He then claimed to be an independent ruler and made
a throne of gold, the chairs of the generals and commanders were
made of silver, he wore a crown and called himself emperor. He made
preparations to invade Iraq and Baghdad and said that he would
rebuild the palaces of the Persian emperors and would reestablish the
Zoroastrian kingdom after wiping out the Arabs. This controversial
talk displeased some of his commanders and he was murdered near
Isfahan in 323 A.H.

Condition of the Provinces
Caliph Radi Billah's government was confined to Baghdad and its
vicinity only. Independent rulers, who had acquired documents
authorizing their rule on the promise of paying taxes, had gone
back on their promises. Basra was under the domination of
Muhammad Raiq and Khuzistan and Ahwaz were under Abu
Abdullah Buraidi. Iran was ruled over by Ali bin Buwayh with the
title Imaduddaulah while Kerman was controlled by Abu Ali bin
Ilyas. Hasan bin Buwayh with the title Ruknuddaulah and
Mardawih's brother Dashmagir were at war with each other in
Rayy, Isfahan and the mountain provinces. Mousil, Deyar Bakr
Deyar Egypt Deyar Rabiyah were under the rule of Muhammad
bin Tafaj and some parts of Mawaraunnahr were under the Bani
Saman rulers . Abu Tahir Qaramati governed Bahrain· and
Yamamah and the Delam commanders had captured Tabristan
while independent states in Andalus, Morocco and North Africa
had existed for many years.
In the very first year of Radi Billah' s enthronement Imaduddaulah Ali
bin Buwayh applied for the documents of authorization for the
province of Iran, the caliph sent the document, a royal robe with a flag
and the title of Imaduddaulah. He conferred the titles of
Ruknuddaulah and Muizzuddaulah to his brothers Hasan and
Ahmad respectively. After Mardawih's death, his army was divided

532

The History of Islam

into two parts one part went to lmaduddaulah in Iran while the other
remained under one of his former commanders named Yahkum.
Yahkum arrived in the Caliph's court and enhanced his influence
and was able by manipulation to dominate over all the leaders who
kept the caliph's court under their control. He received the title of
Amirul Omara, and imposed himself on the caliph and his court and
began to act like the ruler. Dashmagir Mardawih's brother left
Isfahan to Ruknuddaulah bin Buwayh and captured Azerbaijan.
Ruknuddaulah bin Buwayh and Muizzuddaulah bin Buwayh
captured Isfahan and Ahwaz respectively. Muhammad bin Raiq
snatched Syria from Muhammad bin Tafaj leaving only Egypt for
him. During Radi's regime, the caliphate was only a figurehead.
During the last period, Yahkum completely dominated the caliph
and his court and no one dared to oppose him. He himself lived in
Wasit and his head clerk worked as the Prime Minister in the
Caliph's court in Baghdad.

Death of Radi Billah
Having ruled for about seven years Caliph Radi Billah died of dropsy
in Rabia Awwal 329 A.H. Hearing this news Yahkum gave
instructions to his head clerk and in accordance with his orders
Ibrahim bin Motazid Billah with the title Muttaqi lillah was enthroned
as caliph on 29 Rabia Awwal 329 A.H.
During Radi Billah's regime, Muhammad bin Ali-Shalmaghani known
as Ibn Al-Arrafa appeared and claimed to be divine. Many became his
disciples but in the very first year of Radi's caliphate, he was caught
and killed along with his followers who would not recant his claims.
The same year Qaramata looted and plundered Baghdad and Makkah
to such an extent that the inhabitants of Baghdad did not perform Hajj
and none of them dared go to Hajj until 327 A.H.
In 327 A.H., Abu Tahir Qaramati levied a five dinar tax per camel on
the Hujjas. That was the first time pilgrims had to pay a tax for Hajj.
The inhabitants of Baghdad paid the tax and performed their Hajj
comfortably. Radi was the last caliph who read the Friday sermon
himself, all the caliphs after him assigned this job to others.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Pliase)

533

Muttaqi lillah
Muttaqilillah bin Motazid Billah bin Mawaffiq bin Motawakkil was
born of a slave girl named, Zahrah. He came tq the throne when he
was 34. On 26 Rajab 329 A.H., Yahkum was killed by Kurds in the
neighborhood of Wasit. He kept the title Amirul Omara' for 2 years
and 8 months. Following his death goods worth 1,100,000 dinars were
seized and deposited in the Caliph's treasury. In Shaban 329 A.H. Abu
Obadiah Buraidi took an army from Basra and went to Baghdad. The
Caliph ordered him to go back and when he did not obey, the Caliph
sent an army. The army was put to rout and Buraidi entered Baghdad
and demanded 500,000 dinars from the Caliph with the message that
if he did not concede to his demand, he would be deposed and put to
death. The Caliph felt helpless and paid the ransom.
After 24 days in Ramadan 329 A.H. Buraidi's army revolted because
of non-receipt of their salaries. Buraidi fled and went to Wasit. After
his flight, a chief named Kortageen dominated the caliph and his
court. He received the title Amirul Omara. Baghdad at this time had a
large group of people from Delam in addition to the Turks. The
Delamis had started growing in power since Yahkum's rise to power.
The Delamis created an uprising against Kortageen but his power
remained unaffected.
Hearing this, Muhammad bin Raiq who ruled over Syria went to
Baghdad to secure the post of Amirul Omara. Kortageen came out of
Baghdad to face him. Raiq entered Baghdad by force and Kortageen
was arrested and imprisoned . The Caliph made lbn Raiq Amirul
Omara . Muhammad bin Raiq collected taxes from Abu Abdullah
Buraidi by force.
In Rabia Thani 330 A.H., lbn Buraidi invaded Baghdad and defeated
Ibn Raiq. Buraidi's army was made up of Turks and the soldiers from
Delam. They entered the city and started looting and killing. The
Caliph along with lbn Raiq and his own son Abu Mansoor fled to
Mousil. They looted the caliph's palace and the houses of Baghdad.
Some Qaramati also joined in looting. The nobles of the city were
subjected to great humiliation and torture. On the arrival of the Caliph,

534

The History of Islam

the ruler of Mousil, Nasiruddaulah bin Hamdan, left the city. The
Caliph and lbn Raiq consoled him and called him back.
Nasiruddaulah killed Muhammad bin Raiq. The Caliph gave
Nasiruddaulah the title of Amirul Omara while his brother A.bu!
Hasan was given the title Saifuddaulah.
Preparing the army Nasiruddaulah and the Caliph moved to
Baghdad. lbn Buraidi who had captured Baghdad fought but was
defeated in Shawwal 330 A.H. and Nasiruddaulah entered Baghdad
with the caliph. Nasiruddaulah and Saifuddaulah lived with the
caliph for 11 months. Then they returned to Mousil. In Rarpadan 331
A.H., a commander named Tuzoon acquired power in Baghdad and
the caliph gave him the title of Amirul Omara.
In Muharram 332 A.H., Abu Jafar Sherzad entered Baghdad while
Tuzoon was in Wasit. When Abu Jafar entered Baghdad caliph
Muttaqi left Baghdad and fled to Mousil out of fear of him. Tuzoon
and Abu Jafar jointly invaded Mousil and defeated both the brothers
Nasiruddaulah and Saifuddaulah and they along with the caliph went
to Nasiban and from there to Riqqah he wrote a letter to Tuzoon and
reconciled with Banu Hamdan and returned to Baghdad . The caliph
along with Banu Hamdan stayed on in Riqqah.
During the same period, Muizzuddaulah Ahmad bin Buwayh who
controlled Ahwaz invaded Wasit. Tuzoon returned from Mousil and
fought against him on 17 Thul Qada 332 A.H . Though Muizzuddaulah
suffered defeat in the fight, he re-invaded Wasit and conquered it. In
332 A.H., The Russians invaded Barua an Azerbaijani town on the
Russian border. Marzaban Delam heard of this and sent his forces there.
The Russians plundered and killed the Muslims on a large scale. The
Muslims rallied and fought back. The fight continued for a long time
and after many fierce battles the Muslims forced the Russians to retreat.

Deposition of Caliph Muttaqi
Caliph Muttaqi lived with Banu Hamdan until the end of 332 A.H.
Meanwhile resentment developed between them. The caliph wrote
letters for help to Baghdad and to Akhsheed bin Muhammad bin Tafaj
in Egypt. Akhsheed visited the caliph in Riggah on 15 Muharram 333
A.H. and requested him to accompany him to Egypt and live there.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

535

The minister approved of the idea and described to him the benefits of
making Egypt his capital. But the caliph did not agree to it. In the
meantime, Tuzoon' s letter from Baghdad came granting amnesty and
security to the caliph and his minister Ibn Sherzad. The caliph
expressed his sense of joy after going through the contents of the letter
and leaving Akhsheed, he set out to Baghdad at the end of Muharram
333 A.H. Tuzoon received him warmly at Sandyah and lodged him in
his tent. The next day he blinded the caliph with hot pokers. Then he
sent for Abul Qasim Abdullah bin Muktafi Billah. All the members of
the government took the oath for him and called him Mustakfi Billah.
The deposed caliph Muttaqi was also presented in the court and he
also took the oath for caliph Mustakfi. Muttaqi was imprisoned in
Jazirah. After remaining in that state of suffering for 25 years, he died
in 357 A.H. When Qahir Billah was informed of Muttaqi's blindness,
he was overjoyed and began to say. "Now we two have become blind
and the third is waiting." Ironically after a few days, Mustakfi also
met the same fate .

Mustakfi Billah
Abu! Qasim Abdullah bin Mustakfi Billah was born of a slave girl
Amlaahunnas. He came to the throne in Safar 333 A.H. at the age of
41 . Abu! Qasim Fad! bin Muqtadir Billah also made a claim to the
caliphate. He went underground Mustakfi searched for him but he
could not be found. He remained in hiding during his regime. When
Mustakfi failed to locate him, he had his house demolished.
Soon after caliph Mustakfi's enthronement Tuzoon died. Mustakfi
conferred the title of Amirul Omara on Abu Jafar Ibn Sherzad. Having
taken power into his hands, he began to squander money until the
treasury became empty and the entire administration was thrown into
disarray. Theft and robbery were committed with such impunity that
the civilians began to desert the city and migrate.

A Note
The area and size of the Islamic government continued to grow during
the regime of Banu Umayyah. The Islamic government had a single
capital and whatever instruction were issued from the caliph's court

536

The History of Islam

in Damascus, were carried out in all territories from Andalus and
Morocco to China and Turkistan. When the Islamic caliphate came to
Banu Abbas, within a very short time, a separate and independent
government of Banu Umayyah was established in Andalus and instead
of one capital, there were two centers of the Islamic government. Then
Morocco became independent. After that, the governments of
Mawaraunnahr, Khorasan, and Persia went out of the control of the
caliph of Baghdad. At this point in the narrative, the government of
the caliph of Baghdad did not exist even in Baghdad itself. For a long
time the state of the Tigris and Euphrates was under the caliph's rule.
However, when the post of the Amirul Omara (chief of the chiefs) was
created, its government was run by the Amirul Omara he called
himself the subordinate of the caliph but in name only.
The caliph's orders were honored in the city of Baghdad proper.
However, anybody who could subdue others by virtue of their power
could become the Amirul Omara and the caliph would be forced to
confer on him this title. Though the caliph had no power left in his
hands, he enjoyed a bit of liberty and still commanded a sort of
admiration and respect.
Muizzuddaulah Ahmad bin Buwayh, the fisherman's son came from
Ahwaz and dominated over Baghdad and the caliph. He was given
the title Malik (king) and others after him continue to enjoy this
privilege. Muizzuddaulah put the caliph under strict surveillance and
kept him as a respectable captive and seized the little respect he
enjoyed in Baghdad. The caliph's duty was to greet ambassadors from
abroad, the ambassador would be presented before the Caliph and
shown a magnificent exhibition at the artificial court the Caliph would
be used and exploited to serve their purpose. Conferring of titles and
granting of documents were generally done by the caliph but without
option. The actual decisions were made by the Malik alone.

i

The caliph was a figurehead only. The Malik used to fix the caliph's
salary. When he received his salary late or did not receive it, he had to
sell his personal belongings to meet his daily needs. The condition of
the Abbasid caliphs had deteriorated to such an extent that it has
become redundant for a historian to mention them, except for the
word Caliph nothing else remained of their power. In order to

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

537

complete the history of the Islamic governments it is essential to record
the lives and conquests of the rulers who not only ruled in Baghdad but
also the area of the Euphrates and Tigris and other provinces as those
controlled by the Malik. In order to deal with the conditions of these
territories we will continue with the Abbasid caliphs though they are no
more than figureheads, they are still called caliphs.
The important point is that now we are not studying the Abbasid
caliphs but those who were in control of Baghdad. We should not
overlook the fact that though separate and independent governments
were formed and established in provinces all over the Islamic
territories, all still honored the institution of the caliph. His name was
mentioned in the Friday sermons even where he had no power.
In Andalus, the Umayyah caliphate was in power. The Fatimids in
North Africa claimed the caliphate and leadership and the name of the
caliph of Baghdad was never mentioned in Andalus or North Africa.
Besides these exceptions in all other Islamic territories, they recognized
the Abbasid caliph of Baghdad as caliph and their religions leader.
Sometimes a particular Malik would expunge the name of the caliph
from the Friday sermon and have his own name mentioned in it but the
caliph's name did exist in the sermons of the other territories.

The Buhaywid (Buyid) Dynasty in Baghdad
The Buwayh dynasty has been dealt with above Buwayh's three sons
Ali, Hasan and Ahmad had become rulers. Ali (Imaduddaulah)
controlled Persia, Hasan (Ruknuddaulah) ruled over Isfahan and
Tabristan while Ahmad (Muizzuddaulah) had captured Ahwaz.
During Sherzad' s term as Amirul Omara, riots erupted in Baghdad
and Muizzuddaulah invaded it.
Sherzad escaped and went to Banu Hamdan in Mousil and
Muizzuddaulah captured Baghdad easily. Caliph Mustakfi gave him
the title of Malik. Muizzuddaulah then had coins minted in his name
and began to rule over Baghdad with a heavy hand. After some time
he was informed that caliph Mustakfi was conspiring against him. On
that occasion, the ambassador , of the governor of Khorasan arrived
and an open court was held. Muizzuddaulah beckoned to two

538

The History of Islam

Delamis and they moved forwai;:d. The caliph thought that they were
going to kiss his hand so he extended it. They caught hold of his hand
and pulled him down from the throne and arrested him. No one dared
to utter a word.
Muizzuddaulah went home. The Delamis brought the caliph by
dragging and humiliating him to Muizzuddaulah. He blinded him
and put him under house arrest. This occurred in Jumad Awwal 334
A.H. Caliph Mustakfi remained caliph for one year as four months in
name only. He died in this state of captivity in 338 A.H.

Muti lillah
Muizzuddaulah bin Buwayh was the youngest son of Buwayh.
Because they had embraced Islam through Atroosh, all Delamis were
Shiites. The Buwayh dynasty surpassed all other Shiites in excesses
and prejudice. Having humiliated, deposed, imprisoned and blinded
Mustakfi, Muizzuddaulah wanted to enthrone an Alawi. However,
one of his advisers prevented him from doing so and convinced him
saying, "If you make an Alawi caliph, all the people would believe
that he deserved to be caliph and they would prefer to obey that
Alawi caliph instead of you. Whatever influence you have on the
Delamis, it would not last nor would your government and glory
survive. It is better to put an Abbasid on the throne so that all the
Shiites will consider him to be undeserving and will be loyal an
obedient to you in this way Shiite power will continue in Baghdad."
Therefore, Muizzuddaulah called in Abu! Qasim Fadal bin Muqtadi
and entitled him Moti lillah, put him on the throne, performed th
custom of the oath and fixed one hundred dinars per day as his salary
Moti lillah was born of a slave girl Mashghalah. He acceded to th
throne in Jumad Thani 334 A.H.
Muizzuddaulah appointed Abu Muhammad Hasan bin Muhamma
Muhallabi minister to the caliph. The minister was in fact the rea
minister of the country but the caliph was only a figurehead . It ha
been stated above that Nasiruddaulah and Saifuddaulah bin Hamda
had captured Mousil and Syria respectively while Egypt was rule
over by Akhsheed Muhammad bin Tafaj Farghani .

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

539

When Nasiruddaulah came to know that Muizzuddaulah controlled
Baghdad, he left Mousil with an army and arrived at Samrah in 334
A.H. Hearing this news Muizzuddaulah along with Moti lillah went
out of Baghdad to face him. Muizzuddaulah suffered defeat and
returned to Baghdad.
Muizzuddaulah along with Moti lillah reached the western part of
Baghdad while Nasiruddaulah camped in the eastern part. Fighting
began but ended in reconciliation between them. Muizzuddaulah had
his grand daughter married to Na~iruddaulah' s son Abu Qasim
Buraidi. He revolted against Muizzuddaulah in Basra and in 336 A.H.,
Muizzuddaulah along with caliph Moti lillah invaded Basra. Abu
Qasim was defeated and he fled to Qaramata in Bahrain and
Muizzuddaulah captured Basra. Leaving Abu Jafar Sahiri in Basra,
Muizzuddaulah along with caliph Moti lillah returned to Baghdad. In
337 A.H., Muizzuddaulah invaded the governor of Mousil,
Nasiruddaulah bin Hamdan. Nasiruddaulah could not stand the
pressure and he went to Nasiban. In the meantime, Muizzuddaulah's
brother Ruknuddaulah sent news that the Khorasani army had
attacked Jurjan and Rayy and he should send an army quickly.
Muizzuddaulah reconciled with Nasiruddaulah again, left Mousil for
Baghdad and Nasiruddaulah returned to Mousil.
This peace with Nasiruddaulah was made, on the condition that he
would continue to pay the tax regularly and mention the names of the
three brothers in the Friday sermon. In 338 A.H ., Muizzuddaulah had
this order written by caliph Moti lillah, "Ali bin Buwayh popularly
known as Imaduddaulah should work with his brother
Muizzuddaulah as his deputy and fulfill the royal commitment.
However, Imaduddaulah died that year and Ruknuddaulah
succeeded his brother as Muizzuddaulah's deputy. In 339 A.H., The
black stone was restored to its original place in the Ka'bah with a gold
frame around it.
In 341 A.H., a new group appeared which believed in transmigration.
A man claimed that Ali's(~ ) soul had entered his body while his wife
claimed that Fatima's ('-P .11t,,"J) soul had entered her body. Another
said that Jibrail's (Gabriel) soul resided in his body. Hearing their
claims the people beat them up. However, Muizzuddaulah being a

540

The History of Islam

Shia ordered them to stop. He ordered them to respect them because
he said they were from the Prophet's family. In 346 A.H., a great
earthquake took place in Rayy and its neighborhood killing
everyone except thirty people. 150 villages around Rayy sank into
the earth and major parts of Halwan sunk into the water. In 347
A.H., another quake of the same intensity occurred . The same year
Muizzuddaulah launched an offensive against Mousil because
Nasiruddaulah delayed in paying the taxes . He conquered Mousil in
Jumad Awwal 347 A.H.
Nasiruddaulah went to Nasiban. Leaving his assistant Subuktageen,
in Mousil Muizzuddaulah went to Nasiban. Nasiruddaulah left
Nasiban and went to his brother Saifuddaulah in Aleppo.
Saifuddaulah entered into correspondence with Muizzuddaulah and
made peace with him and a treaty was drawn up in Muharram 348
A.H. and Muizzuddaulah returned to Iraq. In 350 A.H., he had a
very large palace constructed for himself in Baghdad the foundation
of which was laid 36 yards deep. The same year the Romans
captured Crete from the Muslims, which had been under their
control since 230 A.H.
In the beginning of 352 A.H., Muizzuddaulah ordered that on 10
Muharram all shops must be closed to mourn the martyrdom of
Imam Husain (~), buying and selling should be suspended, the
rural and urban people should wear mourning attire and lament in
public. Women came out into the streets and markets with their hair
undone, faces blackened, clothes torn, reciting eulogies and, beating
their breasts. The Shiites obeyed this order willingly but the Sunni
Muslims were stunned into silence. The next year the same order
was issued and the Sunnis were also ordered to carry it out. They
could not tolerate this and a riot between the Shiites and the Sunnis
erupted. This public mourning has become a tradition among the
Shiites until today.

Capture of Oman and Death of Muizzuddaulah
Oman was under Qaramata's control. In 355 A.H. Muizzuddaulah
invaded Oman and captured it on 9 Dhul Hijjah 355 A.H. and
expelled Qaramata from there. Thousands of Qaramata's followers

were killed and 89 of their boats were burned and sunk. Freeing
himself from the campaign in Oman, he went to Wasit. He became ill
and went to Baghdad. He was treated in the best possible way but
he did not recover. After ruling for 22 years, he died in Rabia Thani
356 A.H.

lzzuddaulah' s Rule
At the time of his death, Muizzuddaulah had made his son Bakhtiyar
his heir. He was given the title Izzuddaulah from the caliph and began
to rule after Muizzuddaulah. The Delamis had become so powerful
that they were regarded as the real rulers reducing the caliph to a nonentity. They started selecting their heirs to the throne on their own
accord. The caliph chose his successor and the real rulers chose their
successors. Muizzuddaulah was the first king of the Buwayhs and
Izzuddaulah became the second king.
Izzuddaulah appointed Abu! Fadal Abbas bin Husain Shirazi as his
minister. The same year Jati bin Muizzuddaulah revolted against his
brother Izzuddaulah in Basra. Abul Fadal Abbas went to confront him
and brought him to Izzuddaulah as a captive who imprisoned him. In
362 A.H., Izzuddaulah removed Abu) Fadal Abbas from the post of
minister and replaced him with Muhammad bin Baqiah.
Muhammad bin Baqiah was an ordinary man. He was the
superintendent of Izzuddaulah's household. In the same year, Abu
Taghlab bin Nasiruddaulah bin Hamdan imprisoned his father and
took his place as the ruler. Abu Taghlab was married to Izzuddaulah' s
daughter as mentioned above. His two brothers Ibrahim and Hamdan
fled from Mosul and went to Izzuddaulah in Baghdad. They
complained to him about Abu Taghlab and begged for help. Taking
his minister Muhammad bin Baqiah and the commander Subuktageen
with him Izzudaulah invaded Mosul. Abu Taghlab closed down his
office and went to Minjar.
Izzuddaulah entered Mosul while Abu Taghlab left Minjar and went
to Baghdad. Izzuddaulah then sent Ibn Baqiah and Subuktageen to
Baghdad to save it while he stayed in Mosul. Ibn Baqiah arrived in
Baghdad before Abu Taghlab and Subuktageen they wanted to
engage him in a battle outside of Baghdad.

.)

542

The History of Islam

The confrontation between Abu Taghlab and Subuktageen
commenced while in Baghdad a riot broke out between the Shias and
Sunnis. Hearing this Subuktageen and Abu Taghlab reconciled and
decided to unseat all the Shias and enthrone a new caliph but then
decide to suspend the idea. They ·called lbn Baqiah from Baghdad
and made terms for a peace settlement with Abu Taghlab.
According to the terms of the peace pact Ibn Baqiah wrote to
Izzuddaulah to leave Mosul and go to Baghdad and hand over the
rule of Mosul to Abu Taghlab.
Abu Taghlab reached Mosul and embraced his father-in-law,
Izzuddaulah. Izzuddaulah then went to Baghdad and on the way he
went to Ahwaz to collect money. A riot erupted between the Turks
and the Dailanis who were with Izzuddaulah and he punished the
Tmks. Hearing this Subuktageen, who was in Baghdad, rebelled,
looted his house, arrested his relatives and sent them to Wasit. This
occurred in Thul Qadah 363 A.H.
Subuktageen controlled Baghdad and he established a Sunni
government. He expelled all the Shias from Baghdad and then forced
the caliph to abdicate because his paralyses had rendered him unfit
for the job. In Thul Qadah 363 A.H., caliph Moti lillah renounced the
throne and his son Abdul Kareem with the title Taai lillah succeeded
him. Caliph Moti lillah ruled for 26 years and a half as a figured head
only. Nasiruddaulah bin Hamdan had been defending against the
Romans and invading them since he captured Mosul. When
Nasiruddaulah's brother Saifuddaulah bin Hamdan captured Halab
and Homs, offence and defense against the Romans were his
responsibilities. He very actively and successfully retaliated ~nd
defended these territories against Roman invasions. In 363 A.H.,
Izzuddaualh expunged the caliph's name from the Friday sermon.
The caliph expressed his sense of grief and disappointment then
lzzuddaulah stopped his salary. The caliph then had to sell his
belongings to make both ends meet. After his deposition, Moti fillah
title became Sheikh Al-Fadil. He died in Muharram 362 A.H. in Wasit.
Abu Bakr Shibli and Abu Nasr Farabi, Mutanabbi the poet, died
during this administration .

Taai lillahh
Abu Bakr Abdul Kareem Taai lillahh bin Moti lillah was born of a
slave girl named Hazar. He acceded to the throne of the caliphate at
the age of 45 on 23 Thul Qadah 363 A.H. following Moti's abdication.
He conferred on Subuktageen the title of Nasiruddaulah and gave
him a flag and appointed him Deputy of the Ruler replacing
lzzuddaulah. The same year the Friday sermon in Madinah was read
in the name of the ruler Muizz Obeidi. It has been stated above that
when caliph Moti abdicated the caliphate Baghdad was ruled over by
Subuktageen and Izzuddaulah bin Muizzuddaulah was in Ahwaz.
Subuktageen sent lzzuddaulah's mother and brothers to Wasit. Hearing
this news, Izzuddaullah went to Wasit to see his mother and wrote to
his uncle Hasan bin Buwayh known as Ruknuddaulah the ruler of
Iran, to send him reinforcements against Subuktageen and the Turks.
Ruknuddaulah gave an army to his minister Abul Fatah bin Hameed
and sent him to his son Azduddaulah in Ahwaz. He wrote to his son
to come with his army, join Abul Fatah and help his cousin
Izzuddaulah.
Subuktegeen took caliph Taai lillahh and his father Moti with him and
marched to Wasit with an army of Turks. The ruler of Mosul, Abu
Taghlab, heard about this and left Mosul and captured Baghdad.
When Subuktageen and Moti reached near Wasit, coincidently they
both died. The Turks chose Uftageen as their leader and besieged
Wasit. Uftageen was Muizzuddaulah's liberated Turk slave. Uftageen
continued the siege for 50 days.
Azduddaulah with his father's minister Abul Fatah arrived in Wasit.
Hearing of their arrival, Uftageen lifted the siege and went to
Baghdad. Abu Taghlab left Baghdad upon receiving this news and
went to Mosul. Izzuddaulah and Azduddaulah both stayed in Wasit
for a· few days. Then both cousins laid siege to Baghdad and stopped
the food supply to the city, which caused great hardships to the
civilians. The Turks looted Uftageen's house and then began to fight
among themselves. At last, taking caliph Taai li!lahh with him
Uftageen broke the siege and escaped taking refuge in Takret.

544

History of Islam

Azduddaulah and Izzuddaulah entered Baghdad in Jumad Awwal 364
A.H. Azduddaulah corresponded with the Turks and had caliph Taai
lillahh returned to Baghdad. He lodged him at the caliph's palace, took
the oath as a formality for him, arrested Izzuddaulah and began to
govern. Azduddaulah sent Muhammad bin Baqiah to Wasit as the ruler.
Izzuddaulah' s son Zaban, ruled over Basra. He wrote to Ruknuddaullah
complaining against Azduddaulah citing lzzuddaulah' s arrest and
imprisonment. Ruknuddaulah was extremely aggrieved to hear this. He
wrote a threatening letter to Azduddaulah. ln reply, Azduddaulah
wrote to his father Ruknuddaulah:
Izzuddaulah had no capability to govern. Had I not intervened, Bani
Buwayh would have lost control over Baghdad . I promise to pay
30,000,000 dirhams annually to the province of Iraq. If you are interested
in takiri.g control over Iraq, you are welcome. I shall go to Iran.

It is quite evident from the letter that the Provinces of Iraq and Baghdad
were under the jurisdiction of the Dailamis rulers and the strongest ruler
at the time was Ruknuddaulah who lived in Khorasan. The caliph of
Baghdad lived under the chief governor of Baghdad like a captive.
Finally,
at Ruknuddaulah's insistence Azduddaulah released
· Izzuddaulah from captivity and handed over to him the government
of Iraq and took a promise that the Friday sermon in Iraq would be
read in the name of Azduddaulah and Izzuddaulah would regard
himself as the deputy of Azduddaulah. He left Abu! Fatah with
Izzddaulah and went to Iran. After these events, Uftageen went to
Damascus, expelled Muizz Obeidi's governor and captured it. The
civilians of Damascus were pleased with his governance because
Muizz Obeidi's ruler used to impose their beliefs on others by force
and would harass them. With the coi;ning of Uftageen, their ordeal
ended. He introduced the Friday sermon in the name of caliph Taai
instead of the Obeidi sultan. This happened in Shaban 364 A.H.

Azduddaulah's Government
Ruknuddaulah died in 366 A.H. His son Azduddaulah succeeded
him. Izzuddaulah planned to raise an army against Azduddaulah.
Azduddaulah found this out and launched an offensive against Iraq.
He captured Baghdad and Basra in 366 A.H. In the beginning of 367

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

545

A.H., Azduddaulah caught his father's numster Abul Fatah bin
Ameed who had became a supporter of Izzuddaulah blinded him and
put him into prison .
Izzuddaulah then blinded his minister Amad who had joined
Azduddaulah secretly then he went towards Mosul and Syria . There
he won Abu
Taghlab's sympathy and invaded Baghdad.
Azduddaulah arrested and killed Izzuddaulah in the fight, pursued
Abu Taghlab and captured Mosul and Jazirah. Abu Taghlab had no
more allies and went to the Roman emperor who had his daughter
married to Abu Taghlab.
The government of Banu Hamdan was interrupted for a short time.
Azduddaulah ruled for five and a half years and died in 372 A.H. The
noblemen of the government put his son Kakijar on the throne and
gave him the title Samsamuddaulah. Caliph Taai lillahh paid a visit to
Samsamuddaulah to console and congratulate him.

Samsamuddaulah's Government
Samsamuddaulah had several brothers. One of them was
Sharfuddaulah who rebelled against him and captured Iran. In 375
A.H., he invaded Baghdad . In Ramadan 376 A.H., he arrested
Samsamuddaulah and gained control over Baghdad. Caliph Taai
lillahh congratulated Sharfuddaulah. Samsamuddaulah was sent to
Iran where he was set free.

Sharfuddaulah's Government
When Sharfuddaulah took control over Baghdad and Iraq, there were
riots and killings in Mosul After Sharfuddaulah his son Saduddaulah
from
Banu Hamdan ruled over Halab. Sharfuddaulah bin
Azduddaulah ruled for 2 years and 8 months and died of dropsy in
379 A.H. His brother Bahauddaulah succeeded him as the ruler.

Bahauddaulah's Government
Caliph Taai lillahh personally called on Bahauddaulah and gave him
royal robes and congratu~ated him in keeping with tradition.
Bahauddaulah deputed Nasiruddaulah bin Hamdan's sons Ibrahim

History of Islam

546

and Husain to govern Mosul and sent them to the governor there with
his authorization. Later on, he regretted this and wrote to Mosul to the
former governor that the authority should not be handed over to them.
However, Ibrahim and Husain had already captured Mosul by force. In
380 A.H., Bahauddaulah called his nephew Abu Ali bin Sharfuddaulah
who ruled over Iran, and had him assassinated. Then he left for Iran and
seized the treasury capturing Iran. In the meantime, Samsamuddaulah,
who had been in exile there, won the people to his side and began to
conquer the territory. Finally, Bahauddaulah had to compromise with
Samsamuddaulah on the condition that Iran be left under
Samsamuddaulah's control. After this arrangement Bahauddaulah went
to Baghdad were he found the Shias and the Sunnis at war.
Bahauddaulah made peace between them. In Ramadan, Caliph Taai
lillahh held an open court. Bahauddaulah was sitting on a chair near
the throne. The noblemen and the members of the government arrived
at the court and took their seats after kissing the Caliph's hands.
Meanwhile, a Dailamis chief entered and moved toward the Caliph to
kiss his hand. The caliph stretched out his hand and the Dailamis
caught hold of it, dragged and pulled him down and tied him up. The
Dailamis began to loot the caliph's court and palace. Bahauddaulah
left and went home. The Dailamis followed him dragging and
humiliating the caliph on the way. Bahauddaulah then forced him to
announce his abdication and Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Ishag bin
Moqtadir was enthroned with the title Qadir Billah. Taai lillahh was
imprisoned and placed under house arrest in a part of the caliph's
palace. Taai lillahh lived in this state until his death in 392 A.H.

Qadir Billah
Abu! Abbas Ahmad Qadir Billah Ishaq bin Moqtadir was born of a
slave girl named Tamanna. He became Caliph on 12 Ramadan 381
A.H. He was an honest politician. He never missed getting up in the
middle of the night to pray. He was a legal scholar. A few days after
his accession to the throne, both Bahauddaula};:t and Qadir Billah
swore to remain loyal to each other. Qadir Billah tried to reduce the
humiliation, which the caliph of Baghdad had to endure during Taai
lillahh's administration. He tried to raise the status of the caliphate but

i

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

547

the Dailamis had gained too much power and the status of the
caliphate had gone down so much that Qadir Billah could not bring
about any major change. However, he improved his status in
comparison to Taai lillahh.
As mentioned above, Samsamuddaulah and Bahauddaulah agreed to
make peace with each other in 380 A.H. on the condition that both of
them should continue to rule over Iran and Iraq respectively.
Bahauddaulah violated the agreement and sent his army to invade
Iran in 383 A.H. in order to expel Samsamuddaulah's governors_and
bring it under his control.
Samsamddaulah put his army to rout. In 384 A.H., Bahauddaulah sent
a powerful army to Iran under Taghan Turki .
The battles between them continued until 380 A.H. with varied
success. Finally, at the end of Thul Hijjah 388 A.H. Samsamuddaulah,
after reigning for 9 years in Iran, was caught and killed and Iran came
under the control of Bahauddaulah.
In 389 A.H., Bahauddaulah went to Iran in person and left Iraq under
the control of Abu Jafar Hajjaj bin Hurmuz in Baghdad. Caliph Qadir
Billah bestowed on Abu Jafar the title Ameeduddaulah. In 389 A.H.,
the terrifory of Mawaraunnahr went out of the control of Samania
dynasty and that dynasty came to an end.
In 384 A.H ., Khorasan had gone out Samani control. Half of its
government was seized and captured by Subuktageen and the other
half went under the domination of the Turks. This will be dealt with in
detail later in the narrative. After some time a riot broke out between
the Sunnis and Shias in Baghdad. At this news, Bahauddaulah sacked
Ameeduddaulah as the ruler of Iraq and handed over the rule to Abu
Ali Hasan bin Hurmuz in 390 A.H. and gave him the title Ameedul
Juyush. Ameedul Juyush quelled the riot between the Sunnis and the
Shias and administered the country well. In 391 A.H., Bahauddaulah
dismissed Ameedul Juyush and handed over the responsibility of Iraq
and Baghdad to Abu Nasr bin Sabur. There erupted a riot between the
two communities again but they were reconciled . In 370 A.H.,
Bahauddaulah died and his son began to rule. Caliph Qadir Billah
conferred on him the title Sultanuddaulah.

548

History of Islam

The Government of Sultanuddaulah
Sultanuddaulah who succeeded his father Bahauddaulah deputed his
brother Abul Fawaris as the governor of Kerman. Many of the
Dailamis advised Abul Fawaris to seize and capture his brother's
territory. Upon their advice, he formed an army and invaded Shiraz.
After a fierce battle, Abul Fawaris was defeated . Sultanuddaulah
followed him. Abu! Fawaris returned to Kerman but he could not
find refuge there as Sultanuddaulah pursued him. Abu! Fawaris left
Kerman and went to Sultan Mahmood Ghaznawi bin Subuktageen's
court. Mahmood Ghaznawi consoled him. He gave him an army
under the command of one of his commanders, Abu Sayeed Tai.
Abul Fawaris with these reinforcements invaded Iran again. He was
put' to rout again. Having lost, he did not approach Sultan
Mahmood Ghaznawi again because he had not treated Abu Sayeed
Tai well. He went to the ruler of Batiha, Mohazzabuddaulah. He
entered into correspondence with Sultanuddaulah and begged
forgiveness and received a pardon and was assigned to Kerman
again.

The Revolt of The Turks
The tribes of Turks who lived in Kha ta staged a revolt, they took over
a mountain pass between China and Mawaraunnahr and began
looting, plundering and killings in the territory ruled over by Tagha
Khan, the ruler of Turkistan. Tagha Khan raised an army of 120,000
from the Islamic territories. They fought and the Turks escaped he
began to pursue them. He left the jurisdiction of his territory, the
chase lasted 3 months and in the ensuing battle Tagha Khan killed two
hundred thousand Turks before returning to Turkistan. The Turks,
more commonly known as Mongols, were severely punished. This
occurred in 408 A.H.
Sultanuddaulah appointed his brother Musharrafuddaulah as the
governor
of Iraq. Musharrafuddaulah stopped mentioning
Sultanuddaulah's name being in the Friday sermon in Iraq and
introduced his own name. He deposed Sultanuddaulah in 411 A.H .

The Government of Sharafuddaulah
When all the Dailami chiefs in Iraq accorded recognition to
Sharafuddaulah's government and leadership, Sultanuddaulah gave an
army to his son Abu Kalijar. Abu Kalijar captured Ahwaz. After a few
clashes it was decided in 412 A.H., that Sharafuddaulah should rule
over Iraq while Iran should remain under Sultanuddaulah. In 414
A.H., Kufa had a riot between the Sunnis and the Shias. The news of
the riot reached Baghdad and incited a riot the·re also. The Dailamis
who were in power were all Shias. The caliph who was powerless was
a Sunni. The population of Turks who lived in Baghdad and Samrah
were all Sunnis and so they thought it obligatory to comply with the
caliph's orders. Caliph Qadir Billah thought over the situation deeply
and took bold steps in order to help the Sunnis and restrain the Shias.
A good number of the Turks and other Sunnis of Baghdad supported
caliph Qadir Billah and that was why he commanded some status and
respect. Sharafuddaulah died in the fifth year of his rule in 416 A.H.
His brother Abu Tahir Jalaluddaulah, the ruler of Basra, succeeded him.

The Government of Jalaluddaulah
After Sharafuddaulah' s death, the Friday sermon was read in the name
of Jalaluddaulah in Baghdad. Jalaluddaulah left Basra but instead of
going to Baghdad, he went to Wasit. When this occurred, the people
of Baghdad expunged his name from the Friday sermon and inserted
his nephew's name Abu Kalijar bin Sultanuddaulah's instead. Abu
Kalijar was at war with his uncle Abul Fawaris in Kerman. The people
of Baghdad requested Abu Kalijar to come to Baghdad but he could
not get there then Jalaluddaulah left Wasit and went to Baghdad. The
Baghdad army stopped his entry into the city and chased him away.
He went to Basra again. When this occurred, the people of Baghdad
became worried that Abu Kalijar would not be able to come to the
city. The Khorasanis, the Turks and the Dailamis held a council. They
feared that after Jalaluddaulah's retreat there was a good possibility of
some Kurd or Arab leader coming to power. If an Arab came to
power, the Turks and the Dailamis would not be able to conquer
Baghdad and the Arab's control over Basra, Syria, Hijaz, Yamamh,
Bahrain and Mosul would be strengthened by more Arab support.

History of Islam

550

In view of this, letters were sent to Jalaluddaulah inviting him to come
to Baghdad without delay. He therefore came to Baghdad and began
to rule and his name was incorporated into the Friday sermon.

I1.1

In 418 A. H., Jalaluddaulah passed orders for a drum to be beaten five
times a day at the time of prayer. Caliph Qaidr Billah disapproved of
it, as there was no precedent for it and insisted to withdraw the order.
He did withdraw the order but was displeased with the Caliph . After
sometime, the Caliph rescinded his objection and Jalaluddaulah reissued the order to beat the drum at the time of prayer.
In 419 A.H., the Turks revolted against Jalaluddaulah but Qadir Billah
intervened and arranged a compromise between them. Then Abu
Kalijar attacked Iraq and Jalaluddaulah dispatched the army to face
him and a chain of battles began. The two sides continued fighting
until Qadir Billah died in 432 A.H. After his death his son Abu }afar
Abdullah with the title Qayem bi Amrillah was enthroned. Sheikh
Taqiuddin Salah has included Qadir Billah among the legal scholars of
the Shafi school of thought.

Qayem Bi Amrillah
Abu Jafar Abdullah Qayem Bi Amrillah bin Qadir Billah was born of
an Armenian slave girl named Badrudduja on 15 Thul Qadah 391
A.H. He was a handsome, religions, pious and humble man. He was a
literary figure, a calligrapher, generous, a giver of charity and helpful.
Jalaluddaulah's administrative ability had suffered setbacks and that
gave rise to the outbreak of rebellions in his army time after time. In
425 A.H., he settled in Mahalia Karkh and deputed Arsalan' Turki
known as Basasiri to the western part of Baghdad. Basasiri subjected
the people of Baghdad to great harassment. He did not spare even the
caliph. He treated him roughly and rendered him powerless and
reduced him to the position of a prisoner.
Riots erupted between the Shias and the Sunnis. Since Basasiri was
a supporter of the Shias, the Sunnis suffered great losses. The
army revolted in 427 A.H. and encircled Jalauddaulah's house and
looted it. Jalaluddaulah went to Takrait. Caliph Bi Amrillah
intervened and succeeded in bringing the Turks of the army and

...-----------~----=·· · ··-·- ---· The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

551

Jalaluddaulah back together. In 428 A.H., Jalaluddaulah and his
nephew Abu Kalijar reconciled and pledged to live in peace and amity
with each other.
In 429 A.H ., Jalaluddaulah requested caliph Bi Amrillah to bestow
on him the title Malikul Mulook (King of Kings). The caliph
consulted the scholars. and legal experts about its justification. Some
justified it but others declared it unlawful (Editor's note: This title is
mentioned in Hadith as the worst of names). Finally, after being
pressured by Jalaluddaulah he gave him the requested title. In 431
A.H ., Abu Kalijar invaded Basra, expelled its ruler and captured it.
He handed it over to his son Izzul Molook and he went to Ahwaz.
The same year Tughral Baig Saljuk defeated Sultan Masood bin
Mahmood bin Subuktageen's commander and captured Nishapur.
He imposed himself on Khorasan and came to be known as Sultan
Al-Azam.
The same year witnessed the signing of a peace treaty between
Tughral Baig and Jalaluddaulah and the caliph sent his special
messenger Qadi Abul Hasan to Tughral Baig. In Shaban 435 A.H.,
Jalaluddaulah died and the people chose his son Abu! Mansoor
Malikul Aziz as his successor. But Malikul Aziz could not pay the
troops according to their expectations and that disheartened them.
Taking advantage of this Abu Kalijar sent money to the army chiefs in
Baghdad and his name began to be read in the Friday sermon. In Safar
436 A.H., he entered Baghdad and the caliph conferred on him the
title Mohiuddin. In 439 A.H., Abu Kalijar entitled Mohiuddin bin
Sultanuddaulah bin Bahauddaulah
bin Azduddaulah bin
Ruknuddaulah bin Buwayh Dailamis was reconciled with Sultan
Tugharl Baig by marrying his daughter to him.

Abu Kalijar's Government
After assuming the post of second in command Abu Kalijar, by virtue
of his planning, expediency, cleverness and military offensives
conquered Isfahan and Kerman. He ruled for 4 years and three
months and died in 440 A.H. His son Abu Nasr Firoz who chose
Malikur Rahim as his title succeeded him.

552

History of Islam

Malikur Rahim' s Government
Malikur Rahim began his government in Baghdad and Iraq. Another
brother of his Mansoor Khusroo captured Shiraz. The same year a
great riot took place in Baghdad . The cause of the riot was the same
old rivalry between the Shias and the Sunnis. Malikur Rahim invaded
his brother Abu Mansoor Khusroo who had captured Shiraz. Several
battles took place after which Malikur Rahim's other brother and
some relatives revolted in Iraq. In 442 A.H., the Shias and the Sunnis
clashed again in Baghdad leaving hundreds dead on both sides.
The same year Tughral Baig captured Isfahan and sent his brother
Arsalan bin Daw,ood to Iran. He conquered Iran in 442 A.H . Caliph
Qaim Bi-Amrillah sent the certificates of governorship of all those
provinces, which he had brought under his control to Tughral Baig.
On the eve of Eid in 443 A.H., Sultan Tughral Baig went to Baghdad to
pay his respects to the caliph. He was honored with royal robes and
returned. In 445 A.H., Baghdad again witnessed a great riot between
the Sh.ias and the Sunnis. Several areas of Baghdad were burned alive.
Caliph Bi-Amrillah controlled the riot with great difficulty. Malikur
Rahim remained engaged in war with his brothers and nephews in
Shiraz and Basra until 447 A.H.
During this period, Sultan Tughral Baig conquered Azerbaijan and
Jazirah and declared holy war against the Romans. After capturing
huge amounts of wealth from these expeditions, he completed the
conquest of Khorasan and Iran and brought under his control Mosul
and Syria . Then he went to Makkah to perform Hajj afterwards he
concentrated on making the administration of Rayy and Khorasan
more efficient. The worst kind of rulers had been having their sway in
and around Baghdad. In 447 A.H., Tughral Baig sent a letter of
obedience and homage to caliph Q\lim Bi-Amrillah. The same period
saw the return of Malikur Rahim from Basra to Baghdad. He advised
the caliph to continue to live on good terms with Tughral Baig. The
caliph ordered in Ramadan 447 A.H. that Sultan Tughral Baig's r{ame
be read in the Friday sermon. That pleased Sultan Tughral Baig and
he sought the caliph's permission to appear before him. The caliph
granted his request and the leaders of the Baghdad army sent letters

of their loyalty to the Sultan. On 25 Ramadan 447 A.H., a large
reception was arranged for the Sultan in Baghdad.
Basasiri, who was a Shia and had conspired with the Obeidi governor
of Egypt, planned a riot in Baghdad. Tughral Baig arrived in Baghdad
and made careful administrative arrangements and broke the power
of the Dailamis. In 448 A.H., Sultan Tughral Baig married his niece
Khadijah known as Arsalan Khatoon bint Dawood to caliph Qaim BiAmrillah and in this way established a relationship with the caliph's
family. In Shawwal 448 A.H., Sultan Tughral Baig's cousin Qatlimas
clashed with Basasiri at Sanjar and defeated him.
Basasiri then captured the province of Mosul and had the name of the
Egyptian ruler Mustansir Obeidi read in the Friday sermon. The ruler
of the province of Jazirah also rebelled. Sultan Tughral invaded
Mosul, conquered it and punished the rebels and returned to Baghdad
in the begi1ming of 449 A.H. The caliph honored him very much. He
held court and conferred on him the title of 'Malikul Mashriq-walMaghrib' and handed over to him the governments and
administrations of all the territories and provinces.
During the intervening period, Basasiri and the ruler of Egypt Obeidi
misguided Sultan Tughral Baig's brother Ibrahim and caused a
rebellion in Hamadan. Sultan Tughral Baig left Baghdad to stamp out
the rebellion there. Basasiri took advantage of his absence and
captured Baghdad. He had Mustansir Obeidi's name read in the
Friday sermon in the grand mosque of Baghdad on 8 Thul Qadah 450
A.H. The Shias of the city helped Basasiri in all possible ways. He
used the altered Shia call to prayer in Baghdad according to their
tradition. Tired of the oppression of loasasiri, the Sunnis revolted but
lost and many were killed by the military. Basasiri caught the caliph's
Prime Minister and executed him in Thul Hijjah 450 A.H. He sent the
news to Mustansir Obeidi in Egypt and asked for reinforcements
however, he did not get any help from Egypt.
Meanwhile Basasiri received news that Sultan Tughral Baig had been
victorious over his brother Ibrahim. He arrested caliph Qaim BiAmrillah and his wife Arsalan Khatoon and put them under house
arrest somewhere out side Baghdad and had the caliph's palace
looted. Upon receiving this news, Tughral Baig returned to Baghdad.

554

History of Islam

Basasiri heard the news and after a year of ruling, left Baghdad on 6
Thul Qadah 451 A.H. Tughral entered Baghdad. He called the caliph,
enthroned him and asked his forgiveness saying that it was due to his
absence that he had suffered such tortures. Meanwhile Tughral Baig' s
brother Dawood died in Khorasan. Caliph Qaim Bi-Amrillah entered
Baghdad on 25 Thul Qadah 451 A.H.

Summary of the Buwayhid Dynasty
An account of the descendents of Buwayh Dailami, the fishermen,
has already been given in previous pages. It was they, who
dominated over the caliphate and completely ruined it. They
dominated and ruled over the administration of Baghdad and Iraq
as a whole and Iran for over a century. They were Shias and so the
suffering the Sunnis had to under go during this period were too
horrible to describe. Surprisingly, the Alawis did not get any benefit
during this regime. Though the Buyid' s claimed to be loved from the
Prophet's family, they never tried to strengthen any Alawi nor did
they bring any Alawis into power. Some of them were scholars and
a few madrasas started during their regime but they were alt
affected by the Zoroastrian culture. They ended the Abbasid
government and tried to establish a government of their own
community and family.
During their regime all traces of Arab leadership were erased, their
most notorious achievement was that they kept the Shias and the
Sunnis at war with each other and introduced some irreligious rites
to the Muslim community, which still exist until today. The
jurisdiction of their government did not extend beyond Iran and
Iraq. They never were able to rule over Mawaraunnahr and
Khorasan. Syria and Hijaz also remained free from their
abominations. Their 100-125 year long rule is replete with anarchy,
looting, feuds and riots. The Buyid dy11asty was not auspicious for
the Muslims. They worked hard to put an end to the respect, dignity
and grandeur of the Islamic government and did not leave behind
anything the Muslims can be proud of today. This dynasty saw its
end in 447 A.H. and it was replaced by the Seljuq dynasty during
the caliphate of Qaim Bi-Amrillah.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

555

Beginning of the Seljuq Dynasty
The Seljuq dynasty will not be recorded in connection with the
Abbasid caliphs as the Buyid dynasty has been recorded above. It will
find space in a separate chapter. However, it is necessary at this point
to show how the Seljuq dynasty began. The Sasanid and Ghaznavid
dynasties will be covered later in the narrative.
The territory of the Turks extended from the Chinese border to
Khwarzam, Shash, Farghana, Bukhara, Samarkand and Tirmiz. The
Muslims defeated them and made them pay taxes. Some of their tribes
remained in the hard to reach mountain passes near the Chinese
border they lived free from paying loyalty to the Muslims and were
unconnected to China and Turkistan. In 400 A.H., they began to come
out of those passes and raid the territories of Mawaraunnahr, which
had been under the occupation of Turk chiefs after the fall of the
Samani dynasty.
Islam had spread in those areas. Their greatest chief Elak Khan ruled
there. Their greed for looting and killing goaded these Turks, who
were unconcerned with and strangers to Islam to invade Turkistan
and Mawaraunnahr. By 418 A.H., these Turks left their mountain
passes and there forces reached to Azerbaijan. The general chaos and
weakness of the Islamic caliphate enabled them to reach these distant
places and loot the populated areas.
In 418 A.H., a noble and respectable Turkish tribe, which had
remained aloof of these events, concentrated in Turkistan. These
tribesmen camped on a main route in a pasture at a distance of 20
miles from Bukhara. The chief of that tribe was known as Seljuq. This
tribe was more cultured and noble hearted than the other Turk
predecessors. They were nomadic and their herds were with them.
Their numbers were staggering. They were physically very strong and
brave. Mahmood Ghaznawi's governor of Tus informed him of the
arrival of the new tribe and told him that their presence near Bukhara
was a danger. Sultan Mahmood Ghaznawi went to Bukhara and sent a
message to these Turks to send their representative to his court.
Arsalan bin Seljuq or Israil bin Seljuq came to the court of Mahmood
representing his tribe.

556

History of Islam

Mahmood Ghaznawi took him hostage in breach of his promise and
sent him as prisoner to the Indian fort of Kalinjer. Mahmood
Ghaznawi died after two or three years and Arsalan's tribe found it
easier to capture the plains of Khorasan than Turkistan and they
settled throughout Khorasan. The rebel tribes that had been engaged
in killing and plundering joined them. Mahmood Ghaznawi's son
Mas' ud Ghaznawi tried to intercept and stop them and waged several
wars with them. But ultimately they expelled the Ghaznawis from
Khorasan and captured it. Mahmood Ghaznawi's descendents began
to grow weaker and weaker. They made peace with the Seljuqs and
left Khorasan to them. Buwayh's, descendents were engaged in civil
wars and had no power to face the Seljuqs and the Seljuqs made major
advances. As the Abbasid caliph was in Baghdad so the Seljuqs held
him in no special esteem.
The Seljuq tribe had embraced Islam on the plains of Bukhara prior to
their series of conquests. They were unconnected to the Shias because
the Muslims in Mawaraunnahr and Bukhara were Sunnis, which the
Seljuqs had adopted. Those who were sick of the Buyid's oppression
regarded the Seljuqs as saviors. The chief of the Seljuqs, Tughral Baig,
first conquered Khorasan, Azerbaijan and Jazirah. His power
increased and then, as mentioned earlier, went to Baghdad. He
dislodged the Dailamis from power and was given the title Deputy of
the Ruler. His descendents ruled for a long period and his successor
Alp Arsalan Seljuqi founded a powerful government that extended
from the Danube River to the Sindh River in present day Pakistan. We
will now relate the remaining events of caliph Qaim Bi-Amrillah's life.
In 415 A.H., Sultan Tughral Baig's brother Chughri Baig Dawood the
ruler of Khorasan, made a treaty with the Ghaznawi Sultan. The same
year Abul Fadl Behaqi, Sultan Masood Ghaznawi's religious advisor,
wrote his book of history during sultan Ibrahim Ghaznawi's regime.
After Chughri Baig Dawood's death sultan Tughral Baig married his
brother wife, Sulaiman's mother. The same year he attacked, captured
and killed Basasiri while he was in the process of killing and
plundering in Kufa. He cut off his head and sent it to Baghdad where
it was hung on the gate of caliph's castle.
In Muharram 452 A.H., Sultan Tughral Baig became free from the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

557

administration of Baghdad and went to Wasit from there he then went
to the province of Jabal and Azerbaijan. On 15 Rabia Awwal 453 A.H.,
Abu! Fatah bin Ahmad left Ahwaz and went to Baghdad and the
caliph made him his minister. Shortly after that, Abu Nasr bin Jahir
bin Marwan was given the title "Fakhruddaulah" and made minister.
Abu! Fatah was dismissed and returned to Ahwaz.
After his wife's death in 453 A.H., Sultan Tughral Baig sent a message
to the caliph through Abu Sad, the Judge of Rayy that he would like to
marry his daughter SaY'rdah. The caliph refused them. Tughral Baig
sent his minister Ameectul Malik Kundri. Ameedul Malik stayed in
Baghdad until Jumad Thani 454 A.H. and tried to convince the caliph
to agree to the proposal but in vain and he returned to Tughral Baig.
Tughral Baig then sent threatening letters to the Chief Justice of
Baghdad and Sheikh, Abu Mansoor bin Yusuf. They went to the
caliph's court and pleaded with him to give his daughter in marriage
to him. When the caliph saw that the affair ~ight become prolonged,
he decided it was better to agree to the wedding. Besides, his wife
Arsalan Khatoon who was Tughral Baig's niece also pleaded the case
with him. He appointed Tughral Baig's minister Ameedul Malik to
assume the legal responsibility for Princess Sayydah's marriage and to
sign the marriage contract on his behalf. In Shaban 454 A.H., the
marriage contract of the caliph's daughter to Tughral Baig was signed
at the camp of Tabrez.
After the marriage contract was signed, Tughral Baig sent valuables,
gold and jewels as gifts to the caliph and his daughter and transferred
all the property of his deceased wife to Sayydah, the daughter of the
caliph Qaim Bi-Amrillah. Then in Muharram 455 A.H., he left
Armenia for Baghdad and the Princess's wedding feast was held. He
remained in Baghdad until Rabia Awwal and then left along with his
wife Sayydah Khatoon for the province of Jabal. When he reached
Rayy, he fell ill and died on 8 Ramadan 455 A.H.
Tughral Baig had no children. Sulaiman bin Dawood Chughri Baig
was Tughral's nephew and stepson. Ameedul Malik enthroned him
but the people opposed him and read the name of Sulaiman' s brother
Alp Arsalan bin Dawood Chughri Baig in the Friday sermon. He was
the ruler of Khorasan and lived in Merv. Hearing of the enthronement

558

History of Islam

of his brother, Alp Arsalan left Merv and invaded Rayy. Ameedul
Malik presented himself to him as his loyal subject and took the oath
for him. But Alp Arsalan remained doubtful about him and in 456
A.H. he imprisoned Ameedul Malik and made his own minister,
Nizamul Mulk Toosi, the Prime Minister. Having entered Rayy, Alp
Arsalan returned the caliph's daughter Sayydah to Baghdad with
great honor. The Friday sermon in Baghdad was read in the name of
Sultan Alp Arsalan.
Nizamul Mulk Toosi, on behalf of Sultan Alp Arsalan, visited
Baghdad on 7 Jumad Awwal 456 A.H. to take the oath of allegiance
for the caliph. The caliph held an open court and conferred on Sultan
Alp Arsalan the title of' Al-waladul Mu'ayyad'. In 460 A.H., the caliph
dismissed Fakhruddaulah bin Jahir from the ministry but restored it to
him in Safar 461 A.H. In 462 A.H., the ruler of Makkah, Muhammad bin
Abi Hashim expunged the Obeidi ruler's name from the Friday
sermon and put caliph Qaim bi-Amrillah and Sultan Alp Arsalan's
names in it and deleted the Shiite addition to the call to prayer, and
sent his son with a delegation to Sultan Arsalan . The Sultan was
highly pleased and gave him royal robes, 30 thousand dinars as a
reward and fixed 10 thousand dinars per annum as his salary.
In 462 A.H, the Roman emperor Armanoos invaded the Province of
Khalat with an army of 200,000. The emperor was accompanied and
joined by the Kings of France and Russia . Sultan Alp Arsalan defeated
them with only 15 thousand men. He caught the Russian King and
chopped off his· ears and nose. He arrested Armanoos and released
him after taking a commitment of allegiance and loyalty from him.
After dealing this crushing defeat to the large Roman army, the Sultan
went to Mawaraunnahr in 465 A.H. A bridge over the Jejune River
was built and within 20 days, the royal army was able to cross the
river. The commander in charge of an opposing fort named Yusuf
Khwarzmi was ushered into the caliph's court for sentencing. The
sultan said: "Release him. I shall shoot him with my arrow." By
chance, the arrow missed the target. Yusuf ran to the Sultan and
wounded him with his dagger. Those present at the court killed Yusuf
but the Sultan succumbed to the injury on 10 Rabia Awwal 465 A.H.
His dead body was brought to Merv and buried there. His son Malik

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

559

Shah succeeded him. Caliph Qaim Bi-Amrillah sent all the official
agreements and treaties and other official documents to Malik Shah.
On 15 Shaban 467 A.H., the caliph had his doctor let blood and then
he went to sleep. Unfortunately, the punctured vein opened and bled
profusely. The members of the government were called in and they
took the oath for the dying caliph's grandson Abu! Qasim Abdullah
bin Zakhiratuddin Muhammad bin Qaim Bi-Arnrillah. The caliph died
the next day. He had only one son whose name was Zakhiratuddin
Muhammad. He had died during this father's lifetime. Six months
after his death his son Abu! Qasim Abdullah was born. Abul Qasim
came to the throne and adopted the title of 'Muqtadi Bi-Amrillah'.
Caliph Qaim Bi-Amrillah had sat on the throne for 45 years.

Muqtadi Bi Amrillah
Abu! Qasim Abdullah Muqtadi Bi Amrillah bin Muhammad bin Qaim
Bi Amrillah was born to a slave-girl named Arghawan. He was
enthroned at the age of 19 years and 3 months. As soon as he assumed
the throne, he issued orders for playing, singing and using musical
instruments to be immediately banned. During his regime the respect
and power of the caliphate was elevated. He was very pious, religious
minded and courageous. He came into power in Shaban 467 A.H. A
chief of Sultan Malik Shah, Atsaz bin Auf Khwarzmi conquered
Damascus in Thul Qadah 468 A.H. and had the names of caliph
Muqtadi and Sultan Malik Shah read in the Friday sermon. The words
the Shiites had added to the call to the prayer were removed. By
degrees, he occupied the whole of Syria. In 469 A.H., a riot erupted
between religious sects leaving many dead and injured on both sides.
ln 470 A.H., Malik Shah gave Syria to his brother Tajuddaulah Tatash
as a feudal estate and permitted him to capture as much territory from
the Egyptian ruler as possible.
In 471 A.H ., Tajuddaulah Tatash besieged Aleppo (Halab) meanwhile
the Egyptian army encircled Damascus. Atsaz was besieged and
asked Tatash for help. He lifted the siege of Aleppo and went to
Damascus. The Egyptians escaped at the approach of Tatash.
Tajuddaulah Tatash killed Atsaz for his negligence. In 476 A.H., caliph
Moqtadi dismissed Amiduddaulah bin Fakhruddaulah bin Jahir from

560

the ministry and appointed Abu Shuja Muhammad bin Hasan to this
post. Malik Shah called Amiduddaulah .to him and gave him the
governorship of the Provinces of Bakr.

In Shaban 477 A.H., Sulaiman bin Qatalmash Saljuqi, the ruler of
Konya, snatched Antakiah from the Romans. Antakiah had been
under the possession of the Roman since 358 A.H. In 479 A.H., Yusuf
bin Tashfeen, the ruler of Morocco, requested caliph Muqtadi to give
him the certificate of the governorship of all the territories under him
and to confer on him the title of Sultan. The caliph obliged him and
sent him royal robes and the flag and gave him the title of Amirul
Muslimeen. This was the same Yusuf bin Tashfeen who founded the
city of Marrakech. In Thul Hijjah 479 AH., Sultan Malik Shah entered
Baghdad for the first time. He went to the caliph and received a royal
robe and the next day he played polo with the caliph.
Minister Nizamul Mulk inspected the schools he established. Having
lived in Baghdad for a number of months Sultan Malik Shah left for
Isfahan. In 481 A.H., Ibrahim bin Masood bin Mahmood bin
Subuktageen died and was succeeded by Jalaluddin Masood. In 484
A.H., the Normans captured the island of Sicily. The island was first
conquered by the Muslims in 200 A.H. and ruled over by Banu
Aghlab followed by the Obeidis. Sicily was taken from the Obeidis
(Fatimids) by the Normans. The same year in Ramadan 484 A.H.
Sultan Malik Shah arrived in Baghdad again.
In 485 A.H., a QaraMoti killed minister Nizamul Mulk Toosi at the
age of 73 in Nihawand.

I

On 15 Shawwal, of the same year, Malik Shah died and a battle
between his wife Turkan Khatoon and his son Barkiaraq began. In 486
A.H., Barkiaraq became free from the battles and visited Baghdad.
Caliph Muqtadi gave him the title of 'Ruknuddaulah' and honored
him with royal robes of honor and authority. It is said that Malik
Shah's death was caused by Caliph Muqtadi's curse. Malik Shah had
told the caliph to leave Baghdad and go to any place of his choice so
that he could turn Baghdad into his own capital exclusively. The
caliph was given 8 days time and began cursing Malik Shah. By the 8th
day, Malik Shah died and the caliph escaped the ordeal.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

561

Suddenly caliph Muqtadi died on 5 Muharram 487 A.H. It is said that
an adviser of his named Shamsunnahar poisoned him. After his death,
his son Abu! Abbas Ahmad came to the throne and took the title of
'Mustazhir Billah'.

Mustazhar Billah
Abul Abbas Ahmed Mustazhir Billah bin Muqtadi Billah was born in
Shawwal 470 A.H. and succeeded to the throne following his father's
death. Barkiaraq was present in Baghdad at the time. He willingly
took the oath for him.
On the third day after caliph Muqtadi' s death a meeting was held to
mourn his death and Sultan Barkiaraq along with his minister Izz ul
Mulk bin Nizamul Mulk and his brother Bahaul Mulk paid a visit to
the caliph's court. Other members of the government also visited for
the same purpose. In 487 A.H., Mustansir Obeidi, the ruler of Egypt,
died and his son Mustali came to the throne. ln 488 A.H., the rule.r of
Samarqand, Ahmad Khan, was arrested and killed for his irreligious
activities. His cousin succeeded him.
The same year both Tatash and Barkiaraq clashed and Barkiaraq killed
Tatash. This stabilized Barkiaraq's government. His brother
Muhammad grew more powerful. Barkiaraq fought with him at Rayy in
492 A.H. but lost and went to Khuzistan. Muhammad bin Malik Shah
entered Baghdad and received the title of 'Gheyathuddunayawaddin'
from caliph Mustazhir Billah on 15 Thul Hijjah 492 A.H. Then he left
for Khorasan. Barkiaraq left Khuzistan and went to Wasit and
collected an army and entered Baghdad on 15 Safar 493 A.H. The
caliph congratulated him, gave him a royal robe and his name began
to be read in the Friday sermon. He then attacked Muhammad bin
Malik Shah. They fought at Hamadan near the White River, which
resulted in the defeat of Barkiaraq. Then Sultan Muhammad's name
was read again in the Friday sermon in Baghdad on 15 Rajab 493 A.H.
Following his defeat Barkiaraq stayed at Rayy. He left for Isfahan and
then moved to Khuzistan. He collected an army from there and again
clashed with Muhammad on 1 Jumad Thani 494 A.H . After defeating
him, he went to Rayy. Muhammad went to his brother Sanjar at
Jurjan. Barkiaraq arrived in Baghdad on 15 Thul Qadah 494 A.H. His

562

name was read in the Friday sermon.

r;

In short, Sultan Barkiaraq and his brother Sultan Muhammad fought
a series of battles. Sometimes one ruled over Baghdad and
sometim:.s the other. Sometimes they reconciled and then they
would clash again. The incessant battles resulted in the loss of peace
in Iraq, Iran, and Jazirah. People found it difficult to protect their
lives and honor. In Jumadi Awwal 497 A.H ., a treaty of peace was
drafted by the joint efforts of the chiefs of the armies and the
territories were divided between them. Besides, both of them agreed
that the names of both should be read in the Friday sermons of their
respective countries. According to that agreement, the government
of Baghdad remained under Sultan Barkiaraq. After that, he stayed
in Isfahan for a few days. He fell ill and died in Rabia Thani 494
A.H. at Yazdjurd while on the way to Baghdad . At the time of his
death, he declared hi~ son Malik Shah bin Barkiaraq to be his heirapparent and Amir Ayaz his tutor.
Malik Shah was only 5 at the time. Barkiaraq was buried in Isfahan.
Amir Ayaz along with Malik Shah entered Baghdad on 15 Rabia
Thani 498 A.H. The caliph conferred on Malik Shah all the titles,
which belonged to his grandfather Malik Shah bin Alp Arsalan and
his name was read in the Friday sermon there. After that, Sultan
Muhammad captured Mosul and marched to Baghdad. He entered
the city in 501 A.H., killed Amir Ayaz and had his own name read in
the Friday sermon. In 502 A.H., he had a palace constructed in
Baghdad for himself. His government was fully established and
stabilized in his ancestral territories and uprisings and riots became
things of the past. In Shaban, he fell ill. The illness prolonged and
ultimately he died in 511 A.H. His son Sultan Mahmood succeeded
him to the throne.
The caliph accorded approval to his succession and gave him a royal
robe and his name was read in the Friday sermon in all the mosques,
this took place on 15 Muharram 512 A.H. Caliph Mustazhir Billah
died on 15 Rabia Thani 512 A.H. after 24 years and 3 months of his
caliphate. After his death, his son Abu Mansoor Fadal came to the
throne and chose the title 'Mustarshid Billah' for himself.

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

563

Mustarshid Billah
Mustarshid Billah bin Mustazhir Billah was born in Rabia Awwal 485
A.H. and came to the throne in 512 A.H. at the age of 27. Caliph
Mustarshid' s brother Amir Abu! Hasan bin Mustazhir did not take the
oath for him and left Baghdad to Wasit. He was captured after a year
and the caliph excused him and allowed him to stay at the palace. In
the second month after the succession Masood bin Sultan Muhammad
Seljugi, Sultan Mahmood's brother living in Mosul, revolted and also
called Qasimuddaulah Zangi bin Agsanfar, the ruler of Sanjar and
Abul Hija, the ruler of Ardbil to his aid and set up in Iraq. Sultan
Tughral bin Sultan Muhammad was the ruler of Zanjan since his
father's regime. Sultan Mahm;od attacked Tughral. Tughral fled from
Zanjan and Sultan Mahmood looted it.
When Sultan Muhammad died and Sultan Mahmood came to the
throne, Mahmood's uncle Sanjar was the ruler of Mawaraunnahr.
Previously Sultan Sanjar's title was Nasiruddin. After Sultan
Muhammad's death, Sultan Sanjar attacked Sultan Mahmood and the
uncle and the nephew faced off at Sadah in Jumad Awwal 513 A.H.
Sultan Sanjar was also accompanied by Amir Abu! Fadal, the ruler of
Sajistan, Khwarzim Shah Muhammad, the Amir of Anzdar, and
Alauddaulah, the ruler of Yazd. The clash resulted in the defeat of
Sultan Mahmood and the victory of Sultan Sanjar, who captured
Hamadan. When the news reached Baghdad, the Friday sermon was
read in the name of Sultan Sanjar.
Following his defeat Sultan Mahmood took refuge in Isfahan. finally,
Sultan Sanjar's mother who was Sultan Mahmood's grandmother
intervened and compelled them to compromise on the condition that
Sultan Sanjar should consider Sultan Mahmood to be his heirapparent and that Mahmood's name should follow Sanjar's in the
Friday sermon. In keeping with the agreement, Sultan Sanjar sent
declarations that Sultan Mahmood was heir to Mawaraunnahr,
Ghaznah, and Khorasan. Sultan Sanjar took only Rayy from the
control of Sultan Mahmood and he recognized him as the ruler of the
other territories mentioned. On the other hand, Sultan Mahmood
compromised with his brother Sultan Masood and gave him the

564

History of Islam

governorship of Mosul and Azerbaijan provinces. He made Mosul his
capital.
In 514 A.H. Sultan Masood revolted against Sultan Mahmood and
they clashed on 15 Rabia Awwal 514 A.H. Masood lost and took
refuge in the mountains near Mosul. The noblemen of the area
mediated and both the brothers compromised. Sultan Mahmood
n;turned to Baghdad in Rajab 514 A.H. and Sultan Masood began to
rule over Mosul again. In 515 A.H. Sultan Mahmood gave the rule of
Mosul to Aqsanfar Barsaqi and left the province of Azerbaijan with
Masood. Sultan Tughral has already been mentioned . He had gone to
Ganjah after losing to Sµltan Mahmood . In 516 A.H., a treaty of peace
was drafted and agreed to by both Sultan Mahmood and Sultan
Tughral. After that, Sultan Mahmood gave the territory of Wasit and
Mosul as a feudal estate to Aqsanfar Barsaqi. Aqsanfar Barsaqi
deputed Qasimuddaulah Emaduddin Zanqi bin Aqsanfar to govern
Wasit on his behalf. In 517 A.H., Sultan Mahmood killed his minister
Shamsul Malik while caliph Mustarshid sacked Shamsul Malik's
brother Nizamddaulah from his ministry. In Thul Hijjah 517 A.H.,
caliph Mutarshid formed an army and left for Baghdad to punish
Oibas bin Sadqah. The armies of Mosul and Wasit also joined the
caliph. The fight took place at Mubarkah. Emaduddin Zanqi bin
Aqsanfar, the ruler of Wasit, showed exemplar bravery leading to
victory for the caliph. The caliph entered Baghdad victoriously on 10
Muh~rram 518 A.H. That was the first battle after many years that
was waged under the command of an {\bbasid caliph. Then the news
came that Oibas bin Sadqah wanted to loot Basra. Emaduddin Zangi
left to defend it and Dibas returned without success to Tughral bin
Sultan Muhammad . The same year Aqsanbar was appointed defender
of Iraq and had to defend Mosul from Roman attacks. He called
Emaduddin Zangi from Basra to Mosul. He left Basra but did not go
to Mosul. He went to Sultan Mahmood who was in Isfahan . Sultan
Mahmood gave him the certificate of governorship of Basra and he
returned there. When Dibas bin Sadqah went to Sultan Tughral, he
included him among his companions.
Dibas instigated Tughral to invade Iraq. In 519 A.H., Tughral with
Oibas camped at Waquqa. Upon receiving the news caliph Mustarshid
left for Baghdad on 5 Safar 519 A.H. in order to face him. They fought

565

at Nahrwan. Both Dibas and Tughral went to Sultan Sanjar in
Khorasan. In Rajah 520 A.H., Yartaqash Zakwi, the city Magistrate of
Baghdad went to Sultan Mahmood in Isfahan and said, "Caliph
Mustarshid has collected an army and a huge amount of arms and
equipment. His financial condition is very sound and there is a danger
that he might get out of our control." Sultan Mahmood prepared his
army and marched to Baghdad. When caliph Mustarshid heard that
Sultan Mahmood was coming to Baghdad he wrote to him. 'You need
not come here. You should return to punish and ·discipline the
headstrong like Dibas". This convinced Sultan Mahmood that the
caliph really wanted to be free of his subjugation and he began to
move towards Baghdad faster. On 17 Thul Hijjah, he entered it and
the caliph went to western part of Baghdad. On 1 Muharram 521 A.H.,
Sultan Mahmood's men looted the caliph's palace. 30 thousand
inhabitants of Baghdad gathered round caliph Mustarshid to support
him. A chain of battles began along the bank of the river Tigris. After
many battles and trials of strength both compromised. ln Rabia Thani
521 A.H. Sultan Mahmood left Baghdad for Hamadan. He called
Emadudin Zangi from Basra to protect Baghdad. It has been
mentioned above that both Dibas and Tughral had reached Sanjar in
Khorasan. They convinced Sanjar to be against Caliph Mustarshid and
Sultan Mahmood and Sanjar with his army marched to Rayy. After
arriving there, he called Sultan Mahmood to him from Hamadan.
The plan was that if Sultan Mahmood was not an opponent he would
come, otherwise he would refuse. He went to his uncle Sanjar without
any hesitation . Sanjar treated him honorably and recommended Dibas
to accompany Mahmood. Mahmood went to Hamadan with Dibas
and entered Baghdad on 9 Muharram 522 A.H . He took Dibas to the
caliph's court and recommended him to the Caliph. The caliph
excused him. Sultan Mahmood deputed Bahroz to ensure the safety of
Baghdad and sent Ernaduddin Zangi to govern Mosul.
ln Jumad Thani 523 A.H., Sultan Mahmood left Baghdad and went to
Hamadan. Dibas left Baghdad, captured Hilla and rebelled against the
caliph. The caliph sent an army to attack him. The fight was in
progress when Sultan Mahmood heard of Dibas' revolt and reached
Baghdad in Thul Qadah 523 A.H. Dibas left Hilla for Basra. He looted

566

Basra and hid in the mountains. Sultan Mahmood went back to
Hamadan. In Shawwal 525 A.H., Sultan Mahmood passed away. His
son Dawood succeeded him. His name was read in the Friday sermon
in the provinces of Jabal and Azerbaijan.

In Thul Qadah 525 A.H., Dawood marched from Hamadan to Zanjan.
Meanwhile he heard that Sultan Masood came from Jurjan and
captured Tabrez. Dawood at once rushed to Tabrez and besieged it in
Muharram 526 A.H. A series of battles started between the uncle and
the nephew. Finally, they were reconciled. Dawood left Tabrez and
went to Hamadan. Masood came out of Tabrez and began to collect an
army and when a great army was raised, he sent word to caliph
Mustarshid in Baghdad that his name should be read in the Friday
sermon. The caliph replied that at the time Sultan Sanjar's name was
being read in the Friday sermon and that his and Dawood's names
would not be read for the time being. In the meantime, Seljuq Shah bin
Sultan Muhammad raised an army and camped near Baghdad. The
caliph treated him respectfully. On the other side, Sultan Masood won
the sympathy of Emaduddin Zangi the ruler of Mosul, and requested
him to help him. Emaduddin Zangi called on Sultan Masood. Then
both went to Baghdad and camped at Abbasia. Seljuq Shah made
preparations for the battle and sent Qarajasaqi to face them and after a
fierce battle, Zangi's army lost. Emaduddin went to Takrait where
Najmuddin Ayyub (Sultan Salahuddin's father) was the ruler. He
provided boats for Emaduddin and had bridges constructed across
the river. Zangi crossed the river and went to Mosul. Sultan Masood
persuaded 'Seljuq Shah and the caliph through correspondence to
agree to the proposal r that Iraq should remain under the control of
Sultan Masood and Seljuq Shah's name should be read in the sermons
of all countries other than Iraq. In keeping with the agreement, Sultan
Masood entered Baghdad in Jumad Thani 526 A.H. and drafted and
signed the 'peace treaty. Mention has been made above that Sultan
Tughral was with his uncle and Dibas who had hid in the mountains
and then went to Sanjar. Being acquainted with the situation, Sultan
Sanjar along with Tughral and Dibas went to Rayy and then to
Hamadan. On the other side, Masood Shah and Seljuq Shah along
with Qarajasaqi left Baghdad to stop Sanjar. Sanjar advanced beyond
untrabad and faced Masood and Seljuq Shah while Dibas marched on

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

567

to invade Baghdad. Sanjar defeated Masood and Seljuq and the caliph
left Baghdad and faced Dibas and forced him to retr~at. Sultan Sanjar
forgave Masood and Saljuq and treated them with honor. He made his
nephew Tughral the ruler of Iraq and ordered his name to be read in
the Friday sermon. In the meantime, in Thul Hijjah 527 A.H., news
came that the ruler of Mawaraunnahr had made preparations to
revolt. Sanjar left for Khorasan at once. At that time Sultan Dawood
bin Mahmood was in Azerbaijan. He raised an army and moved
towards Hamadan. Opposing him on the other side was Tughral.
Dawood lost and went to Baghdad. Sultan Masood parted company
with Sultan Sanjar and went to Baghdad. Both Dawood and Masood
jointly requested the caliph to allow them to capture Azerbaijan. It
was duly granted and both expelled Tughral's men from there and
captured it. Tughral fought but lost and fled. Sultan Masood occupied
Hamadan and Sultan Dawood took control of Azerbaijan. Sultan
Masood was informed in Hamadan that Sultan Dawood had
announced his independence in Azerbaijan so he marched on him.
Tughral found an opportunity and collected an army and began to
conquer the province of Jabal. Sultan Masood came to confront him
but he was defeated in Ramadan 528 A.H. and went t?)3aghdad while
Tughral went to settle in Hamadan. In detail, the stories of the civil
wars among the Seljuqs in very lengthy and characterless. Sultan
Tughral died and Sultan Masood conquered Iraq. Then there arose
differences between caliph Mustarshid and Sultan Masood. The caliph
came out to fight and both the armies indulged in fighting and killing.
The caliph's army betrayed him and deserted. He was defeated and
imprisoned in a fort in Hamadan. When the news reached Baghdad,
there was sadness everywhere. During the same period, Iraq and Iran
underwent a series of earth tremors for several days. Sultan Sanjar
wrote to his nephew Sultan Masood to go to the caliph in person and
ask for his forgiveness. The earthquakes and the desertion of the
mosque by the people are not ordinary events. Take the Amir alMurninin to the capital Baghdad with honor. Sultan Masood obeyed
and personally went to the caliph. The army that accompanied Sultan
Masood included 17 persons belonging to Qaramata or Batini sect.
Sultan Masood was unaware of their presence. These Batinis went to
the caliph's tent and attacked and killed him. When the people found

1

History of Islam
out about his death, they arrested the Batinis and ultimately killed
them, Sultan Masood was completely shocked. This happened on
Wednesday 16 Thul Qadah 529 A.H. ·When the news reached
Baghdad, there was a furor and the people burst out into spontaneous
lamentations. Caliph Mustarshid's son Abu Jafar Mansoor took the
throne and chose the title ' Rashid Billah' for himself.

Rashid Billah
Rashid Billah bin Mustarshid Billah was born to a slave girl in 500
A.H. When he was born, he had no anus. Surgeons operated upon
him using a silver scalpel and he recovered. When Rashid Billah came
to the throne in Baghdad, Sultan Masood was not present. Rashid
Billah's name was read in the Friday sermon in all the mosques.
After his accession, Rashid Billah used tyrannical methods in
collecting money from the people. They complained to Sultan Masood
against him. Sultan Masood left for Baghdad . Having heard about his
departure to Baghdad Rashid Billah went to Mosul. Sultan Masood
entered the city and prepared a book of evidence in which the
complaints of the people were recorded, that Rashid oppressed such
and such persons, took money by force, shed blood, drank wine, etc.
That document w as presented to the Chief Justice of the legal scholars
for his opinion, whether it was compelling enough to depose the
caliph who committed such acts.
The Judge gave the decision that the crimes were se rious enough to
warrant the caliph being deposed . Therefore Sultan Masood
enthroned Rashid Billah' s uncle Muhammad bin Mustazhir and took
the oath for his caliphate and announced Rashid's deposition. This
took place on 16 Thul Qadah. He had ruled for one year. Muhammad
bin Mustazhir came to the throne and chose the title Muqtafi LiAmrillah for himself.
When Rashid was informed of his deposition, he left Mosul and went
to Azerbaijan and distributed money among his soldiers. H e ruined
Azerbaijan by looting it. Then he went to Hamdan where he created
havoc and violence on an unprecedented scale. He hanged the people,
killed them, had the scholar's beards shaved. Then he went to Isfahan

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

569

and besieged it. In the meantime, he fell ill and on 16 Ramadan 532
A.H. a few non-Arabs came and stabbed him to death. When the news
reached !3aghdad, the official offices were closed for the day to mourn
his death. The royal staff and other items SLgnifying the caliph's
authority were with him at the time of his death they were then sent to
Muqtafi in Baghdad.

Muqtafi Li Amrillah
Abu Abdullah Muhammad Muqtafi Li Amrillah bin Mustazhir Billah
was born to a black slave-girl on 12 Rabia Awwal 479 A.H. and came
to the throne of the caliphate on 12 Thul Hijjah 530 A.H. After that,
Sultan Masood sent an army to punish Sultan Dawood. Dawood was
defeated at Moraghah. He reached Khozistan, raised an army and
encircled Tashtar.
Saljuq Shah the ruler of Wasit, left to defend Tashtar at the insistence
of Sultan Masood but returned after being defeated by Dawood.
Sultan Masood did not leave Baghdad because he felt Rashid might
invade Baghdad . Masood wrote to Emaduddin Zangi the ruler of
Mosul, that Muqtafi's name should be read in the Friday sermon.
When Emaduddin did so and expunged Rashid's name from it, the
latter grew angry and left Mosul in Rajab 531 A.H. as has already been
recorded. A few leaders of Iran decided to go to Rashid to help him and
Masood left Baghdad to face them, he defeated them in Shaban 532 A.H.
Then he went to Azerbaijan. On the other side Dawood, Khwarzam
Shah and Rashid jointly went to Iraq. Sultan Masood defeated them.
Khwarzam Shah and Dawood separated from Rashid. Rashid besieged
Isfahan and at this time some Khorasani slaves assassinated him. Rashid
was buried at Shahristan in Isfahan. Seljuq Shah left Wasit and captured
Baghdad, which caused total anarchy. The people of Baghdad defeated
Seljuq Shah and expelled him from Baghdad.
There was lawlessness and disorder in the whole country so much
that the cover of the Ka'bah could not be sent in 532 A.H. because the
roads were unsafe. Sultan. Masood arrived in Baghdad in 533 A.H.
and exempted the citizens from paying many kinds of taxes, which
they had been paying for a long time. A few years passed in these

570

History of Islam

pitiful conditions. Besides members of his Seljuqi dynasty, other
leaders began to assert their independence.
Sultan Masood overpowered and killed the chiefs whom he
suspected. Many leaders were killed or assassinated deceitfully and
consequently his forces became very weak. He went and settled in the
province of Jabal and left Baghdad and Iraq in a state of restless
disorder. Caliph Muqtafi did not hesitate in taking advantage of the
situation, he began to enhance his power and influence,. The caliph's
power was increasing and Sultan Masood '0.nd Sultan Sanjar were
losing their power gradually. Sultan Sanjar wrote a letter of
condemnation to Masood pointing out the harm of killing the leaders
and leaving Baghdad. Ultimately, Sultan Sanjar himself visited Rayy
in 544 A.H. Sultan Masood also called on him there. In Ra.jab 544 A.H.,
Malik Shah bin Sultan Mahmood along with a few leaders invaded
Baghdad. Caliph Muqtafi remained inside the fort and fought
defensively he called Sultan Masood who was in Rayy for help but
he did not come . Though Malik Shah was not able to enter Baghdad,
he looted Nahrwan and destroyed it. Masood visited Baghdad on 15
Shawwal 544 A.H. and then went to Hamadan in 545 A.H. Sultan
Masood died on 1 Rajah 547 A.H. Masood's minister Khas Baig
enthroned Malik Shah bin Sultan Mahmood. However, following
Sultan Masood's death the government of the Seljuq dynasty ended
in Baghdad and none from it survived to retain the status of ruler of
the realm. Sultan Masood is known as the last ruler of the Seljuq
dynasty. Immediately after assuming power, Sultan Malik Shah sent
a commander to occupy Hillah who captured it. The city magistrate
of Baghdad named Masood Jalal went to Hillah, killed Malik Shah's
chief and began to rule independently. Caliph Muqtafi himself led
the army and invaded Hillah and after capturif\g it took the oath of
allegiance from the inhabitants. Then he invaded Wasit and
captured it and returned to Baghdad on 10 Thul Qadah 547 A.H. In
549 A.H., the caliph sent his minister's son and the Amir of Tarshak
to conquer Takrait. The Amir of Tarshak and the minister's son had
a falling out and the Amir had the minister's son arrested by the
inhabitants of Takrait and he returned to Tarshak via Khorasan. In
549 A.H., the caliph himself invaded Takrait and captured the city
but failed to capture the fort. He returned to Baghdad, gave his

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

571

minister catapults with the capability of breaking up the fort and
sent him to conquer Takrait. He went and besieged it meanwhile
Arsalan bin Tughral bin Sultan Muhammad took an army and
attacked the minister. Hearing this news, caliph Muqtafi left
Baghdad to do battle with him. The armies clashed at Aqr Babu! and
after 18 days of fighting most of the caliph's soldiers had deserted.
Howeve[, the caliph kept fighting on with his remaining men and
was victorious. Arasalan bin Tughral and his chiefs fled from the
battlefield. The caliph returned to Baghdad on 1 Sahban 549 A.H. In
550 A.H., he invaded Waquqa but after few days of siege, he
returned to Baghdad.
It has been stated above that in 490 A.H., Sultan Barkiaraq had
handed over the government of Khuzistan to Sultan Sanjar. When
Sultan Muhammad and Sultan Barkiaraq fell out and fought, Sultan
Muhammad made his own brother Sanjar the ruler of Khorasan.
Since then Khorasan had been under his control and Sultan
Muhammad's son regarded him as Sultan Al-Araq. In 536 A.H., a
group of Kyrgyz Turks snatched the territory of Mawaraunnahr
from the Khans of Turkistan. Sultan Sanjar tried to expel the group
from Mawaraunnahr but unsuccessfully and many veteran soldiers
'lost their lives. Due to Sultan Sanjar's growing weakness, his
subordinate rulers became ambitious. Khwarizm Shah declared his
independence. The Turks who lived in Mawaraunnahr, known as
Oguz Turks, came to Khorasan, looted it and spread anarchy.
These Turks and Sultan Sanjar clashed in 548 A.H. resulting in Sanjar' s
defeat and capture. The new victors kept him with them and began to
loot the cities of Khorasan and also defefited the Kyrgyz Turks who had
taken Mawaraunnahr. The Oguz Turks kept Sultan Sanjar as their
captive and fixed his salary equivalent to that of a groom. However,
interestingly they still read his name in the Friday sermon all over
Khorasan. In 551 A.H., Sultan Sanjar escaped from the prison but died
shortly after in 552 A.H. After his death, Khawarizm Shah and his
descendents captured all of Khorasan and also brought under their
control the provinces of Isfahan and Rayy and the territory that the
descendents of Subuktageen held and continued to rule until the arrival
of Ghengis Khan. During caliph Muqtafi Li-Amrillah's regime, the
kingdom of Khwarizm Shah was founded. In 549 A.H., caliph Muqtafi

572

History of Islam

ordered the ruler of Halab, Nuruddin Mahmood bin Emaduddin Zangi
to go to Egypt and intervene in the affairs of the Obeidi ruler. The same
year Nuruddin Mahmood was given the title of 'Malikul Adil'.
Sulaiman Shah bin Sultan Muhammad lived with his uncle Sanjar
who had made him his heir-apparent. When the Turks arrested Sultan
Sanjar, Sulaiman Shah began to lead the remaining members of
Sanjar's army. Finding no safe place in Khorasan, he went to Baghdad.
He visited the caliph's court in Muharram 551 A.H., took the oath for
him and was given the position of Deputy of the Ruler. His name was
read in the Friday sermon in Baghdad. In Rabia Awwal 551 A.H.,
Sulaiman Shah left Baghdad for the province of Jabal. In Thul Hijjah
551 A.H., Sultan Muhammad brought the ruler of Mosul and other
chiefs into his army and they invaded and encircled Baghdad.
Nuruddin Zangi wrote a condemnatory letter to his younger brother,
the ruler of Mosul, Qutubuddin that he should not have taken part in
the siege of Baghdad and so Qutubuddin evaded fighting against the
caliph. Consequently, Sultan Muhammad lifted the siege in Rabia
Awwal 552 A.H. and went to Hamadan. Qutubuddin returned to
Mosul. Sultan Muhammad bin Mahmood bin Malik Shah contracted a
lung disease after the siege of Baghdad and remained in Hamadan
until he died there in Thul Hijjah 534 A.H. Differences cropped up
among the Seljuqi princes about the accession. Finally, Sultan
Muhammad's uncle Sulaiman Shah who had been under the custody of
Qutubuddin Zangi in Mosul was enthroned. Sulaiman Shah still had to
face resistance from the princes finally his government was established.
Soon after that, one of his commanders Sharfuddin arrested him and his
minister and killed .them. Following this Sharfuddin proposed the name
of Arsalan Shah bin Tughral for the throne and wrote to his Atabek
Alidkaz (Editors note: Atabek or Atabeg a slave tutor who~e influence
could rise to the highest levels even becoming the ruler of certain
territories) to bring Arsalan Shah. Alidkaz arrived in Hamadan with his
army and had Arsalan Shah's name read in the Friday sermon. Alidkaz
was one of Sultan Masood's slaves and an atabek of a high position.
Following Sultan Tughral' s death he married his wife who was Arsalan
Shah's mother. After the succession ceremony of Arsalan Shah Alidkaz
was appointed as the suprel!le Atabek. He sent an application to the
caliph in Baghdad that Arsalan Shah's name be read in the Friday

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

573

sermon there. The caliph humiliated and expelled the messenger. The
caliph's minister made a move to have Mahmood bin Malik Shah bin
Mahmood's name read in the Friday sermon. At the time Mahmood, a
minor, had been taken to Iran by his .father's men. The Iranian ruler
Zangi bin Wakla Salghari snatched Mahmood from them and
imprisoned him in the fort of Astkhar. The caliph's minister, Aunuddin
Abul Azfar Yahya bin Hubairah, wrote to the Iranian ruler to release
Mahmood, take the oath for his caliphate and have his name read in the
Friday sermon in his occupied territories. Zangi complied with the
minister's order. Alidkaz wrote to Zangi to take the oath for Arsalan
Shah. Zangi sent the refusal and collected an army. Alidkaz sent armies
to Iran and battles were fought without any tangible results. On 2 Rabia
Awwal 555 A.H., caliph Muqtafi Li-Amrillah died. He ruled for 24 years
and 4 months as caliph. His son Abul Muzaffar Yusuf succeeded to the
throne with the title of Mustanjid Billah.
Muqtafi Li-Amrillah liberated himself from the influence and power
of the Seljuq kings and ruled over Iraq and Baghdad independently
and that is why he is regarded as the most famous and powerful
caliph among the last weak caliphs.

Dailmia and Seljuqia
After having gained power the Dailmia or the Buyid dynasty
disgraced the Abbasid caliphs and did considerable damaged to the
Islamic caliphate during their regime. There were continuous riots
between the Shia and Sunni in their time and the power of the
Muslims gradually declined. When the Seljuq's took their place and
came to power, the honor of the caliphs and the status of the caliphate
increased . The Seljuqs treated the Abbasid dynasty reverently and the
Seljuqs were far more powerful than the Buyids. The Seljuq Sultans in
general did not betray the caliphs. During their dynasty, the Muslims
regained their lost power and glory. The Seljuqs were more capable of
conquering and governing than the Buyids and they were more
religious minded. During the last days of their rule, their internal
strife and civil wars put an end to their power and this is a malady
from which no dynasty in the world is free. During caliph Muqtafi's
regime, the Seljuqs met their end although the Seljuq chiefs continued
.r
to rule over small tracts, they lost their existence as major rulers.

574

Mustanjid Billah
Mustanjid Billah bin Mugtafi Li-Amrillah was born to a Garjistani
slave-girl named Taoos. He was made the heir-apparent in 547 A.H.
and took the throne in Rabia Awwal 555 A.H. after his father' s death.
In 556 A.H., the Turkamans, the Kurds and the Arabs rebelled one
after another and caliph Mustanjid stamped out these rebellions. The
members of Bani Asad tribe at Hillah outnumbered others and they
appeared to be inclined to rebel. The caliph sent the army against
them and drove them out of Iraq in 558 A.H. In 559 A.H., there was a
revolt in Wasit. That revolt was also crushed by military force. In 563
A.H., a man called Ibn Sawar got the better of the last Obeidi ruler of
Egypt Azid li-dinillah's minister Shadar and turned him out of Egypt.
Shadar left Egypt and went toAI- Malikul Adil Nuruddin Zangi who
was one of the chiefs of the Seljuq kings. His father Emaduddin has
been mentioned above, Nuruddin Mahmood Zangi ruled the
territories of Halab and other parts of Syria and was loyal to the caliph
in Baghdad. Among Nuruddin Mahmood's chiefs Najmuddin Ayyub
his son Salahuddin Yusuf bin Najmuddin Ayyub and Najmuddin
Ayyub' s brother Asaduddin Sherkoh were holding high and
honorable posts. Al-Malikul Adil Nuruddin Mahmood sent
Asaduddin Sherkoh to Egypt with two thousands cavalry soldiers.
Sherkoh killed Ibn Sawar but Shadar did not keep the promises he
had made in Nuruddin's court. It was at that time the Christian
crusaders were attacking the courts of Syria and Egypt and they had
captured some coastal areas. Sherkoh was asked to clear these
Christians out of the country. Sherkoh and his nephew Salahuddin,
after a few months of fighting drove them out of Egypt and then
Sherkoh went to Syria. In 564 A.H., the Christians invaded Egypt
again. Azid li-dinillah again requested Al-Malikul Adil Nuruddin
Mahmood Zangi to help him. Nuruddin again sent Sherkoh with
Salahuddin to Egypt. As soon as the Christians heard about his
arrival, they escaped and Azid li-dinillah made Sherkoh his minister
and kept him in Egypt. Shadar revolted and Sherkoh exterminated
him at once and became busy with his ministerial tasks. When
Sherkoh died in 565 A.H. in Egypt, the ruler of Egypt, Azid li-dinillah

lamps lit. The caliph sent his chief servant Sandal to Nuruddin with
royal robes and black flags for Nuruddin and Salahuddin. Nuruddin
expressed a deep sense of joy at Sandal's arrival and sent the caliph's
royal gifts to Salahuddin. The rule of the Obeidis ended in Egypt and
in its place was established the rule of the Ayyubia dynasty.
Nuruddin had the titles to rule Syria, Jazirah and Mosul and then the
caliph sent to him the documents to rule over Egypt, Syria, Mosul,
Bakr, Khalat, Rome, and Iraq and gave him total power in these
territories by appointing him Deputy to the Ruler. Salahuddin ruled
as governor and king in Egypt on behalf of Nuruddin. Salahuddin
was loyal to Nuruddin, who was loyal to the caliph of Baghdad. Now
all the rulers began to fear caliph Mustazi and his name was read in
the Friday sermons everywhere. No one dared to oppose him. He
appointed Qutubuddin Qaimaz as the chief of the armies. In 570 A.H.,
Qaimaz showed signs of rebellion against the caliph. When the caliph
was besieged in his palace, he climbed on the roof of the palace and
shouted "O people! Qutubuddin Qaimaz's wealth and goods are
lawfµl for you." As soon as the people heard this, they stormed
Qaimaz' s house and looted it. He fled Baghdad and went to Hillah
while he was on the way to Mosul death overtook him. In 573 A.H.,
caliph Mustazi's minister Azduddin Abu! Farah Muhammad bin
Abdullah set out for Hajj with a big caravan. A Qaramati assassinated
him on the way. The caliph then appointed Abu Mansoor Zahiruddin
bin Nasr also known as Ibn Ata as his minister. The.caliph died in
Thul Qadah 575 A.H. after ruling for nine and a half years. Minister
Zahiruddin bin Ata enthroned the caliph's son Abu! Abbas Ahmad
who chose Nasir Li Dinillah as his title.

Nasir Li Dinillah
Nasir Li Dinillah bin Mustazi Bi Amrillah was born to a Turk slave
girl named Zamurrad on 10 Rajab 553 A.H. and he took the throne in
Thul Qadah 575 A.H. after his father's death. He was a very wise,
farsighted and alert Caliph. Immediately after becoming caliph, he sent
messengers to all the Islamic territories asking all the nobles to take
the oath for his caliphate. At that time, Bahalwan bin Alidkaz ruled
over Hamadan, Isfahan and Rayy, The chief scholar Sadruddin was
sent to him to administer the oath. Bahalwan at first refused to oblige

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

577

but when his chiefs threatened him that if he did not take the oath
they would turn against him, he took it. Alidkaz Atabak died in
Hamadan in 568 A.H. Alidkaz as has already been mentioned had
been Arsalan Shah bin Sultan Tughral's tutor and guardian. Alidkaz
had married Arsalan Shah's mother so Arsalan Shah was his stepson.
After Alidkaz's death, his son Bahalwan became Arsalan Shah's tutor.
In 573 A.H., Arsalan Shah also passed away. Bahalwan enthroned
Arsalan' s son Tughral bin Arsalan bin Tughral and he himself
continued to administrate over the above-mentioned territories. When
Bahalwan bin Alidkaz died in 582 A.H., Hamadan, Rayy, Isfahan
Azerbaijan and Armenia were under his jurisdiction and Tughral bin
Arsalan was under his guardianship. After Bahalwan's death, his
brother U thman known as Qazal Arsalan bin Alidkaz took over the
position. Tughral bin Arsalan remained under his guardianship for a
short time and then he decided to part company with him. Along with
some noblemen, Qazal captured a few cities. There were several
battles between Qazal Arsalan and Tughral and gradually Tughral
become more powerful while Qazal Arsalan grew weaker. Qazal
Arsalan sent a message to the caliph's court, declared his allegiance to
him and expressed the apprehensions for the safety of caliph's court in
view of the growing power of Tughral.
Caliph Nasir Li Dinillah had the palaces of the Seljuqi Kings in
Baghdad pulled down and sent Abul Muzaffar Obeidullah bin Yunus
with an army to help Qazal Arsalan. Obeidullah had just reached
Qazal Arsalan when he had to confront Tughral at Hamadan on 18
Rabia Awwal 584 A.H. In a pitched battle, Tughral became victorious
and Obeidullah was captured. The rest of the army fled and retreated
all the way to Baghdad. However, there was another battle between
them and Qazal Arsalan defeated Tughral' s army and arrested him
and imprisoned him in a fort. Qazal Arsalan began to rule over
Hamadan, Rayy, Isfahan and the other territories. He introduced his
name in Friday sermon and minted coins in his name. In 587 A.H.,
Tughral was killed in prison and this brought the rule of the Seljuqs to
an end. Thus, the sultanate founded by Tughral Baig met its end with
a Sultan of the same name, Tughral Baig ..
When Amir Isa, the ruler of Takrait died in 585 A.H., his brothers

captured it. Caliph Nasir sent his army and occupied it and granted
feudal estates to Amir Isa's brothers. Similarly, he won Sharana in 586
A.H. and gave away feudal estates to the nobles there. Then he sent
armies to Khozistan and captured it and deputed Tashtageen bin
Bahiruddin as the ruler on his behalf. At that time, Rayy was ruled
over by Qatlagh bin Bahalwan bin Alidkaz. Khawarizm Shah forced
him to evacuate and captured it. Muayeduddin Abu Abdullah
Muhammad bin Ali after conquering Khozistan at the caliph's
instance and had given it to Tashtageen, was about to march with his
army. Qatlagh bin Bahalwan called on him and persuaded him to
invade Rayy. Muayeduddin went to Hamadan with Qatlagh where
Khawarizm Shah's son was camped with his army. When he heard
about his arrival, he left and went to Rayy and Muayeduddin easily
occupied Hamadan. Then Muayeduddin went to Rayy. Ibn
Khawarizm left Rayy and Muayeduddin occupied it too and
gradually conquered the whole region, which was under Qatlagh's
possession. Khawarizm Shah sent a messenger to Muayeduddin and
asked him to vacate the territory but he replied that the territory was
conquered by caliph Nasir Li Dinillah's army and it would never be
returned. Khawarizm invaded Hamadan with a large army.
Meanwhile Muayeduddin died in Shaban 592 A.H. but his army gave
a tough fight to Khawarizm Shah's army. Finally, due to the absence
of its commander, the Baghdad army suffered defeat and Khawarizm
Shah captured Hamadan. After that Khawarizm Shah went to Isfahan,
conquered it and put it under his son's care and left a large army for
its defense. Then caliph Nasir Li Dinillah gave an army to commander
Saifuddin who drove away Khawarizm Shah's son and captured
Isfahan. Then Hamadan, Zanjan and Qazween also came under the
caliph's occupation. In 602 A.H., Tashtageen, the ruler of Khozistan
passed away and the caliph deputed the deceased's son-in-law Sanjar
to rule. In 606 A.H., the caliph became angry with him. During that
period, as has been stated above, Iran was governed by Atabak Sad
Zangi bin Wakla. The caliph sent his deputy minister with an army to
punish Sanjar. When the minister reached Khozistan, Sanjar left and
went to Sad Zangi in Iran. Sad received him warmly. In 606 A.H., the
caliph's army occupied Khozistan and s~nt for Sanjar but he refused
to come to the Caliph. The Baghdad army marched tow~rds Shiraz the

579

capital of Iran. Atabak Sad Zangi wrote letters recommending Sanjar
to the deputy minister. Finally, Sanjar went to the deputy minister in
608 A.H. who took him to Baghdad and brought him to the caliph's
court in chains. The caliph sent his servant Yaqoot as the ruler of
Khozistan and he set Sanjar free and honored him with a royal robe.
In Muharram 613 A.H., the caliph sent his grandson Muayed bin Ali
bin Nasir Li Dinillah as the ruler of Tashtar, which was part of
Khozistan whose father had died in Thul Qadah 612 A.H. Aghlamash
who was one of Bahalwan's chiefs, he conquered Jabal province by
virtue of his bravery and wisdom and ruled it with stability. He was
killed by a Qaramati in 614 A.H. After his assassination the Iranian
ruler Atabak Sad bin Wakla wanted to capture his territories while
Khawarizm Shah, the ruler of Khorasan and Mawaraunnahr wanted
to capture them from the other side. Atabak Sad Zangi took an army
and conquered Isfahan. Khawarizm Shah was also marching on
Isfahan. They clashed at Rayy and after a bloody battle Atabak Sad
was defeated and captured. Khawarizm Shah brought under his
control all of Aghlamash's territories and sent an application to the
caliph in Baghdad for his own name to be read in the Friday sermon
as his Deputy Ruler. He was refused. Khawarizm then sent his army
to Baghdad but it was caught in a heavy snowstorm and most of his
soldiers perished. The Turks and the Kurds looted the remainder of
the army. Those who somehow survived these disasters returned to
Khawarizm in a very miserable condition. He considered this an ill
omen and returned to Khorasan. He deputed his son Ruknuddin and
appointed Emadul Malik Sadi the Prime Minister and deleted the
caliph' s name from the Friday sermon in the territories he occupied,
this occurred in 615 A.H.
In 616 A.H ., a Mongol tribe, which lived in Tamghach in the Chinese
mountains, revolted. Their native country was a six-month journey
from Turkistan. The chief of the tribe was Genghis Khan who
belonged to the Turk tribe Tamarji. Genghis Khan invaded Turkistan
and Mawaraunnahr, snatched these countries from the Turkanul
Khata tribe and brought them under his control.
Then he attacked Khawarizm Shah and captured Khorasan and Jabal
from him. Then he conquered Araniah and Sherwan. Qne group of

580

History of Islam

these Tatars went to Ghazni, Sajistan and Kerman and conquered
them. After having suffered defeat at the hands of the Mongols,
Khawarizm Shah went to a place in Tabristan and died after ruling for
· 21 years. After defeating Khawarizm Shah they defeated his son
Jalaluddin bin Khawarizm Shah at Ghazni and Genghis Khan pursued
him up to the Sindh River. Jalaluddin crossed the river and entered
India. After living in India for a short time, he went to Khozistan and
Iraq in 622 A.H. and captured Armenia and Azerbaijan. Genghis Khan
and his conquests will be dealt with in detail in a later chapter. After
ruling for 47 years caliph Nasir Li Dinillah died in Ramadan 622 A.H.
It is said that as Khawarizm Shah had quarreled with the caliph an:d
put a stop to the reading of the latter's name in the Friday sermon in
his own countries, it was the caliph who instigated Genghis Khan to
attack him because it was too difficult for him to punish Khawarizm
Shah. Nasir Li Dinillah had spread his spies in all the cities of his
territories. He wanted to keep himself abreast of all the affairs of his
subjects. Most of them believed that he had under him some Jinn who
supplied information to him. He was astute in political strategies and
this helped establish a certain type of awe concerning him in his
territories but the people were not happy. They were sick of his highhandedness and severe punishment~ During his regime, Sultan
Salahuddin conquered many Roman cities and in 583 A.H., he
recaptured Jerusalem after 91 years of occupation by the Christians.
In 589 A.H., Sultan Salahuddin Yusuf the conqueror of Jerusalem
died. During the reign of caliph Nasir Li Dinillah, Abu! Faraj Ibn Jozi,
Imam Fakhruddin Razi, Najmuddin Kubra, Qazi Khan passed away.
After Caliph Nasir Li Dinillah, his son Abu Nasr Muhammad came to
the throne and chose the title Zahir Bi Amrillah for himself.

Zahir Bi Amrillah
Zahir Bi Amrillah bin Nasir Li Dinillah was born in 571 A.H. He qi.me
to the throne after his father's death on 1 Shawwal 622 at the age of 52.
Immediately after assuming power, he turned his attention chiefly to
ruling justly. He provided relief to the people and exempted them
from paying all taxes. He restored to them all their property, which
the earlier caliphs had confiscated . He used to repay the debts of the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

581

people personally. His motto was: "I have opened the shop in the
evening. Let me do some good deeds." One day he was going to the
treasury and a slave said to him, "The treasury remained full during
your father's times." The caliph said, "I see no practicable way to fill
my treasury. I know only how to make it empty. Filling it is the job of
the merchants." He funded many scholars. His regime resembled that
of Omar bin Abdul Aziz. The whole country enjoyed absolute peace
and prosperity and justice but he did not live long. He died after being
caliph for only 9 and a half months on 15 Rajab 623 A.H. After him,
his son with the title Mustansir Billah came to the throne.

Abu Jafar Mustansir Billah
Mustansir Billah bin Zahir Bi-Amrillah was born to a Turk slave girl
and came to the throne after his father's death in Ra jab 623 A.H. He
resembled his father in moral virtues. He tried to impart and promote
justice as his father had done. He was very fond of observing religious
rites. He founded a school named Mustansaria in Baghdad and
appointed renowned scholars as teachers there. The construction work
started in 625 A.H. and ended in 631 A.H. He started a library in
which rare and invaluable books equal to 160 camel loads were kept.
The teachers for 'Hadith' 'Grammer' Medicine and 'Heredity' were
separately appointed. The school was responsible for the provision of
their food, sweets, dry fruits and other things. It received much
popular support. In 628 A.H., Malik Ashraf laid the foundation of
Darul Hadith Ashrafia. It was completed in 630 A.H. In 629 A.H.,
Muhammad bin Yusuf bin Hud revived the Abbasid dynasty in
Andulas. In 634 A.H., Alauddin Kaiqabad bin Qalj Arsalan bin
Sulaiman bin Qatlamash bin Israil bin Seljuqi who had been ruling
over the greater part of Asia Minor died and his son Gheyathuddin
Kaikhusru came to the throne. In 641 A.H., the Mongols attacked and
defeated him. He surrendered to them and agreed to pay tribute. The
two centuries of Seljuq rule ended in Asia Minor. Gheyathuddin
Kaikhusru · ruled by paying tribute to the Mongols until 656 A.H.
when he died. During th'e same period, the great ancestor of the
Ottoman dynasty began his rise to power. This will be narrated in
detail later.

582

History of Islam

Caliph Mustansir tried his level best to create an efficient
administration and promote justice in the country. However, as the
Turks and the Mongols started conquering states and provinces one
after another, his income diminished. Salahuddin Yusuf' s sultanate,
which consisted of Syria and Egypt, was ruined due to disunity. The
flood of Mongols looted and desolated all the territory extending from
Mawaraunnahr to the Roman (Mediterranean) Sea and the Black Sea.
At this time, the caliph had Iraq under his control and the Mongols
were still wary of him and they did not approach his territories. Just
as the Kings of Khorasan, Azerbaijan, Mosul, and Syria feared the
Caliph's displeasure similarly the Mongols recognized the leadership
of the caliph of Baghdad and dared not behave impertinently. The
Mongols were sun-worshippers and did not come as Muslims like the
Seljuqs so they did not care whose name was read in the Friday
sermon at the mosques. Therefore, the name of the Baghdad caliph
was being read in the Friday sermon as usual and that made him feel
relieved. Having seen the surge of the Mongols Caliph Mustansir's
brother, Khafaji, who was valiant and courageous, used to declare. "If
I become caliph I would rub off the name of these Mongols beyond
the river Jejoon."
In 641 A.H., Caliph Mustansir died. The people did not enthrone his
brother Khafaji who was qualified in all respects and fully deserved it.
They preferred Mustansir's son Abu Ahmad Abdullah because he was
soft hearted and simple. The members of the court liked a caliph in
whose regime they could make progress and grow more powerful. So,
Abu Ahmad Abdullah came to the throne of caliphate with the title
Mustasim Billah.

Mustasim Billah
Mustasim Billah bin Mustansir Billah was born to a slave girl named
Hajir in 690 A.H. and ca~e to the throne after his father's death. He
lacked courage and intelligence. Though he was religious minded and
observed all 'Sunnahs', he appointed Muayeduddin Ibn Alqami as his
minister who was a fanatic Shia. As soon as he became minister, he
turned the caliph into a puppet and became the ruling power in the
government. Ibn Alqami began to push the Shias forward and allowed

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

583

them many concessions. The unorthodox additions to the religion
which were current during the regime of Dailam were revived, which
resulted in the outbreak of riots between the Shias and the Sunnis
similar to those found during the Dailamis regime. He became busy
trying to obliterate all signs of the Abbasids and establish the Caliphate
of the Alawiites. In Baghdad, some sensible people knew about his
evil plans. They informed the Caliph of Ibn Alqami's treacherous plot
but the caliph was such a great fool and coward that he narrated all
these complaints to Ibn Alqami himself. Ibn Alqami convinced him of
his loyalty and declared them to be treacherous and traitors. The
Caliph was fully convinced of his allegiance. That increased his
influence all the more and the tongues of his supporters were silenced.
Then Ibn Alqami led the Caliph to drown himself in sports and
drinking and thus he became safe from any harm. After a few days,
the caliph's son Abu Bakr attacked Karkh near Baghdad, to stop their
heavy handedness and passed uncomplimentary words against Ibn
Alqami. It made Ibn Alqami sad and he complained to the caliph but
the caliph, regardful of his son, did not punish Abu Bakr in
accordance with his wishes. That made Alqami all the more
treacherous. He entered into correspondence with Genghis Khan's
grandson Hulegu Khan who was the greatest chief of the Mongols and
the King of Khorasan. When Hulegu Khan got the first letter, he did
not pay much attention to it. Ibn Alqami had written that he would
help him capture Baghdad and Iraq easily without any bloodshed and
so he should invade them. Hulegu said to his emissary only this:
'What Ibn Alqami promises has no guarantee. How could we believe
him?' In fact, the Caliph's huge army, the Arab valor and the courage
of the people of Baghdad had impressed the Mongols and their armies
had suffered defeat at the hands of the Arab tribes in Syria. Ibn
Alqami went to the caliph and after complaining about the shortage of
revenue and increase in the salaries of the army, he proposed a
reduction in the number of soldiers. The Caliph agreed. The major part
of the Baghdad army was.sent to other cities and states. Those who
remained were allowed to collect the revenue from the market for the
payment of their salaries. This caused great agonies to the citizens and
looting became rampant. He disbanded many divisions of the army
and turned them out. He told the Caliph that they were sent to the

584

History of Islam

border to check and stop the infiltration of the Mongols. In Hillah, the
Shias outnumbered the Sunnis, he goaded them to write letters to
Hulegu saying, Our ancestors had predicted that such and such a
Mongol chief would capture Baghdad and Iraq in such and such year.
According to that prediction, you are the victorious chief and we are
sure that you are going to occupy these territories very soon. We are
loyal to you and ask you for security and protection." Hulegu wrote
the letter of protection for them and handed it over to the messenger
Nasiruddin Toosi who enjoyed a great reputation at Hulegu' s court
and discharged the duties of minister. He was also a fanatic Shia like
lbn Alqami and he was an accomplice in his intrigue of ruining the
Abbasids and establishing the caliphate of the Shiites. Ibn Alqami
wrote to Nasiruddin to goad Hulegu Khan to attack Baghdad at any
cost and that it was a golden chance to deliver the la.,t mortal blow to
the Abbasids. He also wrote a letter to Hulegu Khan that said . 1 have
evacuated the armies from Baghdad and sent away all the weapons of
war. What greater guarantee do you want?" Along with this, he had
an application sent him by the ruler of Ardbil, which contained an
inducement to launch an offensive against Baghdad . Hulegu received
the letters after he had already conquered the Maut Fort of the
Qaramata (Ismailites) and the last King of the lsmailites had already
come in chains before him. Hulegu sought counsel from Nasirruddin
Toosi. He said Astrology says that Baghdad will come under your
control and you will suffer no losses if you invade it." Hulegu sent a
huge army as a vanguard to Baghdad. When Mustasim heard about it,
he sent Fathuddin Dawood and Mujahideen Ebak with 10 thousand
horsemen. The commander of the army was Fathuddin who was a
veteran and experienced general and a brave man. The Mongol army
was defeated and it retreateci. Fathuddin thought it proper to stay
there but Mujahideen, due to inexperience, insisted on pursuing them.
Being compelled Fathuddin went after the Mongols. Consequently,
the Mongols turned back and fought. Those Mongols who had gone
into hiding attacked from the rear. The Baghdad army was
sandwiched in and was totally at a loss. Fathuddin was killed in
action and Mujahideen fled and took refuge in Baghdad. It was
because of the bad planning of Mujahideen that the victory of the
Baghdad army turned into defeat. But caliph Mustasim, due to his
11

11

II

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

585

innate foolishness expressed joy at the sight of the run-away
commander. Though the Baghdad army suffered defeat, Hulegu
Khan's vanguard was also in disarray with many wounded. So, caliph
Mustasim was satisfied that the storm had passed off peacefully. But
as Ibn Alqami who had kept the caliph completely in the dark was
laughing at the latter's stupidity, news suddenly spread that Hulegu
Khan had laid siege to Baghdad with a huge army. The citizens tried
to defend and for 50 days they did not let the Mongols enter the city.
The Shias of the city approached Hulegu Khan's army one after
another and received a pledge of safety and apprised him of the
situation in the city. Minister lbn Alqami remained in the city and
kept sending information minute by minute. As the minister had no
sympathy with the people of the city, they gradually grew weaker. At
last minister lbn Alqami came out of the city, met Hulegu Khan,
sought security and safety only for himself and returned. He said to
the caliph, "I have a pledge of safety for you too. Come let us go to
Hulegu. He will let you continue to rule over Iraq as the Mongols
allowed Gheyathuddin Kaikhusru to rule over their territories." The
caliph came out of the city with his sons and went to Hulegu's army.
Hulegu saw him and said, call all the members of your government
and the religious and legal scholars of your city too." Hulegu Khan
detained the caliph. Hearing the caliph's command the scholars and
government leaders came out of the city and went to the Mongol
army. All of them were slain one by one. Then Hulegu said to the
caliph, "Send the message to all the citizens to lay down their arms
and come out of the city empty handed." Mustasim sent the message
to them. They came out and the Mongols began to put them to the
sword . All of them numbering several hundred thousand soldiers,
cavaliers and nobles of the city were cut to pieces. All the moats and
ditches of the city were filled with the corpses. The water of the river
Tigris turned red due to the excess of blood of the slain. The Mongols
entered the city. Women and children with the Quran on their heads
came out but none was spared. Hulegu Khan ordered his army to
undertake a general massacre. The Mongols killed everyone they laid
their hands on. Only a few persons who hid themselves in wells and
similar places survived. The next day, Friday in Safar 656 A.H.
Hulegu Khan entered Baghdad taking Caliph Mustasim with him, he

586

History of Islam

held court in the Caliph's palace, called the caliph before him and said
to him, "We are your guests present us something". The Caliph was so
terror stricken that he couldn't find the right keys. At last, the locks of
the treasury were broken. Two thousand fine clothes, one thousand
dinars and gold ornaments were presented to Hulegu Khan. He said
"Had you not given these things to us, they would have still been
ours." Having said so, he distributed them among his courtiers. Then
he ordered the treasures, which no one knew about, to be located. The
Caliph at once told him of their whereabouts. The ground was dug up
bringing into view tanks full of gems and bags of coins. Ten million
and six hundred thousand Muslims were butchered in and around
Baghdad and the Caliph had to watch all these tragic scenes. Hulegu
kept the Caliph without food and water. He felt hungry and asked for
food. Hulegu ordered a tray full of gems to be put before him to eat.
The Caliph said, "How can I eat it?" Hulegu sent word, "Why did you
not spend these inedible things to save the hundreds of thousands of
lives of the Muslims and give it to your soldiers to fight on your behalf
and save your ancestral country and protect you from us?" Then he
held a counsel with his men regarding killing Mustasim. All favored
his death. However, Nasiruddin Toosi and Ibn Alqami seeing the
irony of luck said to Hulegu Khan, "Mostasim is the caliph of the
Muslims. Swords should not be stained with his blood. He should be
covered with and rolled in a blanket and kicked." The task was
handed over to lbn Alqami. He rolled his master into a blanket and
tied him to a pillar and had him kicked so much that he died. Then his
dead body was again kicked and run over by the Mongol soldiers
until it was torn to bits. lbn Alqami stood by laughing and thinking
that he was avenging the Aliwiites. In short, the dead body of the
caliph did not find either a shroud or a grave and none of the Abbasid
dynasty who was captured by the Mongols survived.
Then Hulegu turned to the royal library, which contained countless
books. All the books were thrown into the Tigris River, they formed a
sort of dam in the river and gradually the water swept them away.
The water of the Tigris, which had turned red with the blood of the
slain, now turned black with the ink of the books and it continued to
be so for a long time. All the royal palaces were looted and then
leveled to the ground. It was such a horrible carnage and catastrophe

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

587

that it is unprecedented in the history of the world. It was such a
calamity for Islam that they have called it a small dooms day. lbn
Alqami who engineered the annihilation and blood shed now tried
and wanted Hulegu Khan to appoint some Alawi ruler in Baghdad
and confer on him the title of caliph. In the beginning when Hulegu
Khan invaded Baghdad, many promises were made to him and he
was sure that Hulegu Khan would make some Hashmite Alawi caliph
and he (Alqami) would be made his Deputy Ruler but Hulegu Khan
deputed his own men to rule Iraq. Ibn Alqami was at his wit's end
seeing these developments. He planned and planned, entreated and
begged Hulegu Khan to achieve his end but Hulegu Khan chided and
drove away him away like a dog and for a short time, he continued to
serve the Mongols like an ordinary slave but ultimately the frustration
killed him. Caliph Mustasim Billah was the last caliph of the Abbasids
who ruled in Baghdad. After 656 A.H., Baghdad ceased to be the
capital. There was no caliph for three and a half years in the world
after caliph Mustasim. After him, they took the oath for his uncle Abu!
Qasim Ahmad in Rajah 659 A.H.

The Abbasid Caliphs in Egypt
Sultan Salahuddin bin Ayyub had founded the sultanate of Ayyubia
after the Obeidia (Fa timid) dynasty, which has been recorded
,.~ in detail
above. The power of ruling over Egypt, Syria and Hijaz remained in
the dynasty of Sultan Salahuddin until 648 A.H. As Sultan Salahuddin
was a Kurd, the sultanate of Ayyubia is also called the sultanate of
Kurdia. The seventh King of the sultanate of Ayyubia was Malik Saleh
who was the great grandson of Salahuddin's brother. In order to save
himself from family rivals he purchased twelve thousand slaves from
Mount Qaf, that is, the province of Sarkesia and raised a modern
army. During his rule, the Christian King of France brought soldiers
on board ships and invaded Egypt. The Egyptian army fought with
the invaders humbled and defeated them and captured the French
King on the battlefield. It raised the status of the Egyptian army's
reputation. After Malik Saleh his son, Malik Moazzam Tooran Shah
came to the throne. But after two months, Malik Saleh's slave girl
Shajratuddur usurped the throne. Her regime gave rise to discontent

588

History of Islam

and rebellion. After ruling for three months she went into retirement
and a man of the Ayyubia dynasty, Malik Ashraf Musa bin Yusuf, was
formally enthroned. His regime strengthened the slave's power.
Finally, in 653 A.H. they enthroned Azizuddin Ebak Salehi with the
title Malik Moizz marking the end of the Ayyubia dynasty and the
beginning of the slave dynasty (Mamluk dynasty) that lasted for many
years. In 655 A.H., Malik Moizz' s young son Ali succeeded to the
throne. He was given the title Malik Mansoor and Amir Saifuddin
Mamlook was assigned as his tutor and mentor. In 657 A.H., they
deposed Malik Mansoor based on a religious judgment that he was a
minor and therefore not eligible to be the leader, he was replaced by
Amir Saifuddin with the title Malik Muzaffar. The slaves selected 2025 persons from among themselves and gave them the authority to
rule as a council. They were regarded as the council of ministers and
they chose one from among themselves as the amir or king. After
assuming power, the Amir was enthroned as a King and was called
Sultan or Malik. The Sultan used to distribute important portfolios
and posts among the members of the council. The Prime Minister was
chosen from among the 20-25 council members also. Head of the
Police and Head of Finance were considered to be major _portfolios.
The rest were awarded lesser posts and powers. Sarkasian slaves were
purchased at government expense if there became a shortage of
soldiers. A slave dynasty also was in power in India too with the
exception of two or three kings all the kings were descendents of King
Shamsuddin Altamash and they carried the title of slave but had
become very sophisticated as the dynasty evolved but the slaves
holding the throne in Egypt were often slaves who had been
purchased on the auction block and then by virtue of their personal
merits gained access to the throne. Historians have not pay heed to
this fact and failed to state in unequivocal terms this quality of the
slave dynasty of Egypt. In fact, the slave dynasty of Egypt needed
reforms on some points but it is most admirable that the subjects had
full liberty in choosing their ruler. The reign of this dynasty will be
recorded in a separate chapter. At this stage in the narrative it is
necessary to mention that Malik Muzaffar after hearing about the
annihilation and plunder of Baghdad, the rest of Iraq, Khorasan, Iran,
Azerbaijan, Jazirah and Mosul and the Mongols destruction of the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

589

territories of Iraq with all their power, was galvanized into action. He
along with his slave armies and armies of freemen left Egypt for Syria .
On Friday 15 Ramadan 655 A.H., the general of the slave army
Ruknuddin Baybars gave them a crushing and humiliating defeat the
like of which they had never suffered before. Thousands of the
Mongols perished on the battlefield and the rest fled in terror. The
slaves captured huge quantities of spoils and inspired fear in the
Mongol's hearts. The Mongols turned upside down many kingdoms
but they never looked towards Egypt out of fear of them. The slaves
pursued them up to Halab and then returned to Egypt. On 16 Thul
Qadah 658 A.H., Ruknuddin Baybars ascended the throne after Malik
Muzaffar's death and chose Malik Zahir as his title. He came to know
that the last and 37th caliph of the Abbasid dynasty Mustasim Billah's
uncle Abu) Qasim Ahmad who had been in prison in Baghdad for a
long time escaped at the time of the desolation of Baghdad and
Mustasim's ;;urder. He found out that he was alive and in hiding
somewhere in Iraq. Malik Zahir sent a 10 member Arab delegation
from Egypt to search for him. They succeeded and returned to Egypt
with him. Hearing the news of his arrival Malik Zahir along with all
the scholars and the members of the Egyptian government came out of
Cairo to receive Abu) Qasim and escorted him respectfully into the
city. They took the oath for his caliphate on 13 Rajab 659 A.H. and
proposed the title Almustansir Billah for him. The king had his name
read in the Friday sermon and imprinted on the coins. He came to the
grand mosque with the caliph in procession on Friday. The king spoke
about the virtues of Abbas in the Friday sermon and made a prayer
for the caliph. After the Friday prayer, the caliph presented him with a
royal robe. On Monday 4 Shaban 659 A.H., tents outside Cairo were
pitched. The caliph held court and declared Malik Zahir as the Deputy
Ruler. Malik Zahir assigned servants for him and reserved a part of
the Egyptian treasury for him with authority to use it as he liked.
After three years, he went to Syria with Malik Zahir' s army to fight
against the Mongols and he was lost or killed in the battle. Following
his disappearance one year passed when Malik Zahir received
information about a lost Abbasid Prince. He found him and enthroned
him as the caliph. His name was Abul Abbas Ahmad bin Hasan bin
Ali bin Abu Bakr bin Khalifa Mustarshid Billah bin Mustazhir Billah.

590

History of Islam

Up to his great grandfather, none had been a caliph and thus the
Abbasid caliphate started again with a descendent of caliph
Mustarshid. His title was suggested as Hakim Bi-Amrillah. He was
enthroned on 8 Muharram 661 A.H . In 674 A.H., Malik Zahir
conquered Sudan. It was considered to be a grand victory. Malik
Zahir died in Muharram 676 A.H. then Malik Sayeed came to the
throne. In 678 A.H ., Malik Mansoor took the throne. He gave a
crushing defeat to the Mongols in Syria in 680 A.H. In 689 A.H., he
died and Malik Ashraf succeeded him. On 18 Jumad Awwal 701 A.H.,
caliph Hakim Bi-Amrillah died after reigning for 40 years 5 months
and 10 days and was buried in Cairo, he was succeeded by his son
Abu Rabi Mustakfi as caliph. The slave government remained in
power until 923 A.H. Sarkeshi slaves, called Bahriya slaves, reign was
followed by another community of slaves in 784 A.H. called Charkasi
slaves who began to rule as kings. The last Sultan of the Bahriya
slaves, Sultan Malik Saleh was deposed in Ramadan 784 A.H. and was
replaced by Barqooq Charkas with his title Malik Zahir. Until 922
A.H., Charkasi (Gurji) slaves ruled as kings in Egypt. The last King of
Gurji or Charkasi slaves Sultan Tooman Beg suffered defeat at the
hands of Sultan Saleem Uthmani and Egypt was annexed to the
Ottoman Empire. As mentioned above, the second chain of the
Abbasid caliphs began with the slave rule in Egypt and it ended with
the rule of the slaves in 922 A.H. The condition of the Abbasid caliphs
in Egypt was that of figureheads only. They were caliphs in name only
and they named their heir apparent. The Muslim Kings of India and
other countries received the documents authorizing their Kingship
and received titles from them. The slave Kings of Egypt also
considered themselves to be the Deputy Rulers of those caliphs,
treated them with respect and read their names in the Friday sermons.
However, in reality they enjoyed no power or glory. Their salaries
were fixed . The Egyptian Sultan did not let them go anywhere freely.
These caliphs with the members of their families used to live
imprisoned within their palaces. They were called caliphs but they
were as ignorant and as far from understanding the meaning of the
Islamic caliphate as the sky is far from the earth. After capturing
Egypt, Sultan Saleem Uthmani subjugated the Abbasid caliph
Muhammad of Egypt who was the 18th and the last caliph in the

The Caliphate of the Abbasids (Third Phase)

591

chain of the Egyptian Abbasid caliphs. The flag and robe that the
Caliph had as symbols of the Caliphate with him were given to Sultan
Saleem with his consent. Sultan Saleem took the last Abbasid caliph
with him when he left Egypt. That Abbasid Caliph made Sultan Amir
his heir-apparent and thus in 922 A.H. the Abbasid caliphate that
began with Saffah and had been reduced to name only after 800
years met its end and the Ottoman dynasty which deserved the
Caliphate most at that time began. There were 37 Caliphs in the
Abbasid dynasty that ruled in Baghdad and Iraq plus 18 in Egypt a
total of 55 Caliphs.
While following the chain of the Abbasid dynasty, we have moved
away from studying important branches of rulers and other
developments, which we will now address. Normally at the end of a
dynasty, we make some summary comments and review. However,
we have said what we wanted to say about the Abbasid Caliphate and
do not want to lose the natural impression, which is produced on the
heart after reflecting on the consequences or end of this grand dynasty
of Caliphs.

A General Study of Umawi and
Abbasi Caliphates

Part One
The caliphates of Banu Umayyah and the Abbasids are over. But their
study conjures up a small picture of their Caliph's rule, power,
conquests and battles. What the historians in general write about the
condition of the kings and rulers has been narrated above. The art of
writing history has improved and it also looks into the principles of
government, society, educational institutions of the times and the
governments of the time period in question. Twice the amount of
pages of this short history would be required to fulfill these
requirements and cannot be fully delved into in these volumes. Taking
into consideration these deficiencies, a few facts are given below on
the authority of some reliable books.

Important positions and offices of the Government
The caliphate of Banu Umayyah was a victorious and international
government during its period of rule the Arabs were regarded as

594

The History of Islam

victors and other nations as the vanquished. The Arabs had religions
zeal and to them no laws except the laws of the Quran and the Sunnah
of the Prophet(~ ) were binding ana practicable. The Muslims fought
among themselves but the common life style of the inhabitants of the
Islamic countries like Arabia, Syria, Egypt and Iraq and the restoration
of peace despite internal invasions and battles did not demand any
complex system of the government. The Caliph sought consultation
but he was not compelled to seek it either. He received consultation,
which was unsolicited and sometimes he had to accept it. The plain
living of the Arabs was reflected in their government as well. Even an
ordinary Bedouin could have access to the Caliph and his royal
presence did not reduce their linguistic power. The Caliph sent
deputies to rule over the provinces and states and they enjoyed total
power and royal support there. The Caliph was the ruler of the entire
Islamic world similarly he was also its commander-in-chief. The
Governors of the Provinces and States were the Kings and the
commanders of their Provinces or States. They were also the religious
heads 'Imams' and Chief Judge. Whenever the Caliph had any doubt
regarding a religious issue, he had no inhibitions in consulting the
religious and legal scholars. Similarly, the Governors and the rulers of
States also had to seek their opinions. Sometimes a Governor was
appointed for a province and along with him the Caliph appointed
another person as chief judge.
The functions of the governor were to maintain law and order in the
country, to invade, to be always ready for defense against the
enemies, to protect the subjects and to collect taxes and deposit them
in the treasury. The functions of the judges were to promulgate
Islamic laws, to settle disputes and force the people to uphold the
Islamic law. The judge was not dependent upon the governor.
Sometimes along with the judge and governor, a tax collector was
separately appointed by the Caliph who handled all financial matters.
In that case, the Governor was the commander of the armies. In short,
simplicity was the hallmark of the caliphate of Banf'Umayyah. All
grievances were redressed in the light of Islamic law and the subjects
were happy and prosperous due to the system of equal justice. They
were neither unduly taxed nor was it necessary for the Caliph to
spend lavishly on the administration. The Caliph was considered to be

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

595

the spiritual head of the whole Islamic world as well as the temporal
ruler. For this reason it was easier to maintain peace in the country.
There was no regular post of minister or advisor. During an
emergency, anyone could discharge the duties of minister or advisor.
During the Abbasid caliphate, the Iranians and the Turks began to
enjoy the rights of the victorious or conquering nation besides the
Arabs and by degree, the vanquished nations grew more powerful.
Therefore, complications developed in the administration. If the
Arabs, the Iranians and the Turks were kept on an equal footing
according to the Islamic laws and real equality was maintained, there
would have appeared more simplicity and virtue in the
administration than had been available even during Banu Umayyah's
times. Unfortunately, situations kept cropping up and opposition and
rivalry between these nations kept increasing. The greatest cause for
this was that the Iranians were preferred over the Arabs. The Caliph's
court adopted the Iranian and the Sasanid way of living and rejected
the comfortable simplicity of the Arabs. Because of this, the Islamic
caliphate suffered so many complications that gave way gradually to
the decline in reliability, power and ultimately led to its end.
However, the purpose here is to present a list of the major portfolios
of the Abbasid Caliphate.

The Prime Minister
In the beginning, the Caliph had only one minister and he fully acted
as the Caliph's deputy and head of all departments. Later on, when it
transpired that one man could not do justice to all the departments,
other ministers under the Prime Minister were appointed. There were
matters, which only the Caliph was authorized to do and only the
Prime Minister could advise him. At the time of seeking opinion, the
Caliph invited not only the Prime Minister but also the other members
of the government to participate. Some caliphs for instance Caliph
Haroon Rasheed had vested all powers to his Prime Minister in
matters of the administration of the country. The Prime Minister
himself issued all kinds of instructions and the Caliph was formally
informed of them. Such powerful ministers enjoyed high status and
they were regarded as having more authority than the Caliph himself.

596

The History of Islam

Later the caliphs began to grow weaker and the Dailami, Amirul
Omara or Seljuk, Sultan imposed themselves on the caliphate both the
Caliph and the Sultan had their own separate Prime Minister. In those
times, to be the minister of the Caliph was not a major position.
During this dual charge regime sometimes the Caliph's minister was
called president and the Sultan' s minister was named minister.
Sometimes the Caliph's minister enjoyed more powers than the Caliph
and when the Sultan appointed the Caliph's minister, the Caliph
would be his own minister's prisoner.
The Caliph used to select the Prime Minister on the basis of his
personal knowledge and sometimes he gave the royal robe of the
ministry to a man of a lower stratum of society and raised him to the
pinnacle of prestige and sometimes a minister's son succeeded his
father as minister. Haroon Rasheed's minister Jafar Barmuk, Mamoon
Rasheed's ·"'m inister Fadal, Alp Arsalan and Malik Shah' s minister
Nizamul Mulk are famous ministers.

Amirul Omara (Chief Executive)
This post was created during the declining period of the Abbasid
caliphs. Having imposed themselves on the Caliph, the people chose
this- title for themselves and were granted it from the Caliph. These
Amirul Omara were in fact the rulers of Iraq, Iran, and Khorasan and
they appointed all their office bearers. The Caliph was a Caliph only
in name or only for the purpose of the official oath. The Dailamis'
(Buyids) period lasted for 100 years and their rulers were all called
Amirul Omara.

The Sultan (King)
Just as the Dailamis chose Amirul Omara as their title, similarly the
Seljuks selected the title Sultan for themselves. These Seljuk Sultans
were more powerful, more religious, ruled over wider and larger
territories and were more loyal to the Caliph than the Dailamis. The
Dailamis had seized all the power and influence of the Caliph's court.
The Seljuks recognized the Caliph's greatness and allowed them to
rule and it was during their regimes to a great extent that the caliphs
succeeded in their attempt to get back their power and glory. There

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

597

were no posts of Amirul Omara and Sultan in the beginning of the
Abbasid caliphate.

Amil or Wali (Governor)
The governors of the provinces and states used to send a fixed amount
of his revenue every year to the Caliph's court. He enjoyed absolute
liberty in the inner administration of the province and he used to send
a fixed amount annually to the Caliph's treasury. It was on a contract
basis in most cases. Another form was, the Amir used to send the
surplus amount after the annual expenditures were deducted, in this
case he had to justify the income and expenditure of his province and
he was not responsible to pay a fixed sum. The border provinces,
which were far away from the capital usually, used the contract form.
A very small sum was realized from those provinces as tax and
sometimes the reading of the Caliph's name in the Friday sermon was
considered sufficient. The change or removal of the governors in these
provinces was not regarded as necessary until they betrayed, opposed
or rebelled but the governors of the other provinces were changed
after short intervals.

Sahebu Shurta (Police General)
The man responsible for maintaining law and order in the cities,
quelling rebellions and arresting thieves and robbers was known as
'Sahebu Shurta' . We may call him the Chief of Police. This man had
his headquarters in Baghdad and appointed deputies in the other
cities of Iraq. Sometimes he was the commander in chief of the Iraqi
forces and the Governor of a Province. Tahir bin Husain was the
Sahebu Shurta who ultimately became the governor of Khorasan.
This was a very responsible post and no ordinary man would be
appointed to it.

Hajib (Chief Body Guard)
Besides being the Caliph' s bodyguard and the officer of bodyguards,
the Hajib had a highly intimate relation with the Caliph. He always
accompanied him at home and on journeys and was the trusted man
in his privacy. All the servants of the Caliph's palace and the

598

The History of Islam

watchmen of the police were his subordinates. He was ever ready to
teach manners to every new entrant to the Caliph's court and to carry
out all his commandments.
At times the Prime Minister had to yield to the Hajib. He was the
Caliph's confidant and shared his secrets. Haroon Rasheed had Jafar
Barmuk killed by his Hajib, Masroor.

Qadiul Qudat (Chief Justice)
The permanent post of the Qadiul Qudat (Chief Justice) was first
created by Haroon Rasheed, this post contimied until the end of the
Abbasid period. The Qadiul Qudat appointed his deputies in all
provinces and territories on his own authority. His main functions
were to see that the people followed the Shariah laws and to settle
disputes. It was a very high post. His position at the court was in no
way inferior to that of the commander-in-chief and the Prime
Minister. A new Caliph was accorded the status of the real Caliph
only when the Qadiul Qudat recognized him as such. It was the
Qadiul Qudat who issued the Fatwah (legal religious
pronouncements) for the dismissal of the Caliph. The Caliph could
sack the Qadiul Qudat but at the time of the accession of a new
Caliph, the Qadiul Qudat's approval was essential. In important
matters concerning invading a country or appointing the governor
of a province he was consulted. If the Caliph, in the capacity of the
commander-in-chief, invaded a country, the Qadiul Qudat
accompanied him or he sent a deputy with each army. His seal on
pacts, agreements, documents of Governorship, important
commandme1~ts of the Caliph and wills was compulsory.

Raisul Askar (Army Chief)
Though every Caliph, every Amir, every minister and every
important person could be the commander, there was a Raisul Askar
or the commancfer-in-chief of the regular army of the Caliph. It was
not a permanent post. Every division of an army had a commander.
The Caliph could appoint who ever he liked as the Commander-inchief. The commar:ider of big and important expeditions was generally
the Raisul Askar.

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

599

Mohtasib (Inspector)
The duty of a Mohtasib was to make rounds in the city, deter the
people from violating the Shariah laws and punish them for
committing misdeeds. They morally reinforced them by helping to
remind the people to implement their Islam in the market places and
other public places. He was subordinate to the Qadiul Qudat and was
under the Chief of Police's authority. In modern terminology, we may
call him a municipal inspector. He was also authorized to inspect the ,
weights and measures of the traders?and shopkeepers and arrest and
punish any defaulters. A Mohtasib along with his subordinate staff
was appointed in every town and market complex.

Nazir or Mushrif (Vigilant)
The Caliph appointed a Mushrif to look after all the government
departments. He was given the status of a minister. A separate Mushrif
or inspector for each department was appointed under him. After
receiving reports from all the departments, the Mushriful Ala (Chief
Inspector) presented a report to the Caliph. They were an internal
department for the improvement of the administrations efficiency.

·sahebu Bareed (Postmaster General)
The Caliph appointed Sahebul Bareed or Postmaster General to run
and look after the Postal department in each province. His duty was to
see to the departure of the royal post and arrange the horses at
outposts for the messengers. It was his responsibility to see that a
proper number of horses, mules or camels were always kept ready.
It was his duty to gather news and information of important events
from all the provinces and communicate it to the Caliph's court. He had
a body of sleuths under his command they supplied information about
the subjects, the officers and the conditions of the departments of each
province. He appointed his deputies in every city. This department
dispatched public letters from one place to another. It also used
pigeons for sending messages. The Postmaster General kept with him
a register that contained the details about every post office, location,
directions, and distances of the outposts and the list of the staff.

600

The History of Islam

Katib (Secretary)
The Caliph appointed a Katib (Secretary) . He held the rank of
minister. His duty was to read to the Caliph the letters from abroad,
write orders, issue instructions at the command of the Caliph and
keep the necessary documents in safe custody. He had under him the
offices of different departments such as the office housing the copies
of royal orders, the registry office, and the office of military
communications.

Amirul Minjaniq (Military Engineer)
He held the post of chief military engineer. Making roads, selecting
places suitable for a battlefield and encampments, pulling down the
enemies' forts and fortifications were part of his duties. His counsel
ancl: proposals regarding laying siege to forts or cities were given
specific importance.
,,,,.

Amirut Tamir or Raisul Banna (Chief Architect)
He was the chief Engineer. He was responsible for construt:ting and
repairing the royal palaces, public works construction projects,
digging canals, constructing bridges and embankments.

Amirul Bahr (Naval Commander)
The chief of the warships and all naval forces was called Amirul Bahr.
There were many officers under him and each of them had a war ship
under his own command and reported to the Amirul Bahr.

Tabib (Doctor)
Tabib was the chief medical officer. More than one experienced and
efficient doctor was always present at the court of the Caliph and in
the capital. They took part in academic meets and were part of the
community of intellectuals. Many hospitals and medicine shops were
run at government expense under his supervision. They came from all
countries and religions.

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

601

Other Important Departments and Offices
Though considered to be an independent ruler the Caliph was not
supposed to rule with absolute impunity. When he was made
Caliph and the oath was taken for him, he had to take a pledge
that he would follow the Quran and the Prophet's traditions. The
Scholars and legal experts had a right to object to any unlawful
acts and were able to control him. If the Caliph's power came in
conflict with their rights the subjects would fight against him and
support the scholars and experts to the point of deposing the
Caliph. Sometimes the scholars evaded discharging their duties
and that led to corruption and weakness. Sometimes the Caliph
would take advantage of his greatness and grandeur and issue
orders without consulting anyone and have them implemented.
However generally, all the public work was done in accordance
with certain fixed rules and regulations and thus the government
machinery used to run smoothly. That is why despite battles
among the Sultans and dissension among the Amirs, the masses
still had the opportunity to make progress in the arts and sciences
and become more cultured and disciplined during the reign of the
Abbasid caliphate. In the beginning of the Abbasid caliphate, the
foundations of different arts and sciences were made. Invaluable
documentation had already established. Then the Abbasid
caliphate began to lose strength but the pace of development of
their arts and sciences and inventions did not slow down. One of
its greatest contributions was the implementation of a system of
government, which was based on Islamic principles that remained
undisturbed even after the government had become weak with
battles and strife. Even during the period of anarchy and
discontent, its character was ever present. That was why the
educational, social and moral developments did not receive major
setbacks . Although the governments of the Samanis, Saffaris and
Seljuks were not stable, great scholars were bor11 during their
reigns and under their jurisdiction and reputed scholars of the arts
and sciences left their immortal works behind.

602

The History of Islam

Diwanul Aziz
The Caliph's court was known as Diwanul Aziz. Similarly, the office
of the prime minister who dominated over all government
departments and had his say in all matters and who appeared to
virtually hold the reins of power in his hands was also called
'Piwanul Aziz' . All offices and departments were under him. The
Prime Minister was supposed to issue orders after consulting with the
heads of all the departments concerned.

Diwanul Khiraj
This may be called finance or tax revenue department. Sometimes it
was directly handled by the Prime Minister and sometimes by a
separate minister who was subordinate to the Prime Minister.
Sometimes the Caliph did not let the Prime Minister have any link
with the Finance Minister but had him connected to his own Katib
(Secretary). Sometimes the Finance Minister appointed his deputies in
the provinces himself and they were free from subordination by the
governor of the province concerned. Generally, the Finance Minister
empowered the Governors of the provinces to spend money but not
without making them answerable for what they spent.

Diwanul Jizya or Diwan Dhamam
These offices housed the documents related to the Jizya (tax on nonMuslims for exemption from military duty) and the Dhimmis (non.Muslims who paid a tax for being exempted from military duty). It was
responsible for the collection, fixation and exemption of the Jizya. The
chief of the department was regarded as a subordinate to the Finance
Minister. He had to carry out the Qadiul Qudat's (Chief Justice's)
instructions related to the reduction or exemption of the Jizya.

Diwanul Askar
This department maintained the army register of military personnel. It
had a direct link either with the Prime Minister or the Caliph. It
disbursed salaries to the soldiers, the commander-in-chief was also
considered to be an officer of this department. He was concerned with

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

603

this department to the extent that he was responsible for the
disbursing of the salaries in his presence. The purchase of horses,
mules, and camels, the collection of arms, and tailoring of uniforms
were functions of this department.

Diwan Shurta
The Police officers and their management were under the supervision
of these offices. The head of this department was the Chief of Police.
The Mohtasibs also discharged their duties under this department.
The salaries of the police of this department were higher than those of
the soldiers and they were recruited with great care.

Diwan Dhaya
This department was concerned with the management of the revenue
of the territories of Iraq considered to be the Caliph's feudal property.
Its responsibility was to increase the produce of the fields and keep
them always ploughed, seeded and green.

Diwan Bareed
Headquarters of the postal department were in Baghdad . It had
details regarding maps of the territories, lists of the post offices,
necessary directions about each stage of the road, instructions for the
employees, reports of the services of the employees and workers and
records and guidelines for peace and safety of the roads.

Diwanun Nafaqat
This department maintained the registers concerning the expenses,
rewards, daily allowances and gifts of the Caliph's palaces.

Diwanut Tauqi
The department of the royal seal kept copies of each order issued by,
or with the seal of the Caliph. This department, which may also be
called the Official Registry department, was under the charge of the
Katib (Secretary).

604

The History of Islam

Diwanun Nazr Fil-Mazalim
The incharge of this department was the Mushriful Ala (Chief
Inspector). He used to test the performances of the workers, correct
errors in the registers and offices, inspect the offices and deter the
workers and officers from wrong doing.

Diwanul Anhar
This department undertook the repair, safety of the canals and
enhancement of the resources of irrigation. In addition to the farmers,
the wealthy and other interested parties concerned with welfare
activities were at liberty to dig canals. If the farmers or the inhabitants
of a particular region wanted to dig a new canal, the government paid
half of its expenditure. In cases of disputes between the two villages
over the distribution of water, the government would let the farmers
settle their disputes by peaceful means otherwise the department
intervened and settled the problem. The benefit that the government
received from the new irrigation canals was the increase in the
collection of revenue, when production increased, the government
received higher payments.

Diwanur Rasayel
The office of Correspondence's main functions was to prepare the
manuscripts of pacts and agreements, sealing them with the official
seals after having copied the royal orders, stamping these orders and
putting them into envelopes, keeping copies of important judgments,
sending copies of the royal mandates to provinces and cities,
dispatching public petitions to the departments concerned and
proposing the proper administrative policies for the offices.

Dami Adi
It could hear the appeals of every court. The Judge of Baghdad, the
Chief Justice, ministers, legal experts and scholars of the city would
gather and hear the major cases at the Darfil Adi (Hall of Justice). The
Caliph would also participate as President. If the Caliph himself was
involved in the case, the Prime Minister or the Chief Justice would

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

605

preside over it. If the Governors were charged with rebellion or the
Generals were accused of hatching a conspiracy they were given a
chance to clarify their position. In this court, only those persons who
could present written proof of his good conduct and standing duly
signed by a judge and a Mohtasib (local inspectors of the market
place) could stand witness. People of great status feared giving
evidence at this court in case their conduct was questioned and
objected to and their evidence rejected.

Darul Qada
The Judge's Court was a unique form of the Islamic justice system.
Every Judge of the city could be a judge and magistrate in the Judge's
Court. If anyone filed a case against the governor or administrator of
the city, he had to appear in this court as an ordinary citizen and give
proof. In order to handle the cases of non-Muslims, judges from
among them were appointed. In the court of a non-Muslim judge, all
civil and criminal cases would be heard and judgments delivered. In
the case where one party was a non-Muslim the parties could by
mutual consent take their case to whatever court they liked but an
appeal in such cases would be heard by the Judge's Court. Even the
non-Muslims in general liked to have their disputes settled at the
Judge's court.

General Conditions of the Government
The government did not impose itself in the life-style and internal
relations of the common people. The internal management of the
cities and villages were in the hands of the citizens. They chalked
out the plans of their safety quite freely. If they resented an
administrator, they sent an application to the Caliph for his transfer
and the Caliph generally granted it. No administrator was
appointed without the consent of the citizens concerned. The
inhabitants of a city were themselves a military force. At times, an
army would surround the administrator of a city, he would face his
enemies with the help of government forces but the citizens could
compromise with the besieging enemy and the administrator would
have to leave the city.

606

The History ofislam

The official in general dared not deprive the citizens of their rights.
Even an ordinary man could have access to high officials including the
Caliph and say (earlessly whatever he wanted to say. The caliphs tried
their utmost to endear themselves and prove themselves beneficial to
their people. The Abbasid caliphs honored and patronized the arts
and sciences.

Traveling Facilities
The Abbasid caliphs made careful arrangements for the safe passage
of all travelers on the roads of Iraq, Hijaz, lran, Khorasan, Mosul, and
Syria. Groups of soldiers were assigned for the purpose of safety of
the roads and outposts were set up at appropriate distances. Royal
horses, camels and other means of traveling were available at every
stage. A rest house was kept reserved for travelers at every stage of
the toad. Even the public could ride on the royal horses belonging to
the postal department. Sometimes if the roads became dangerous due
to robbers or rebels, royal forces would accompany a band of traders
or other travelers. Similarly, for the sake of protection and safety an
army was put under the charge of the Amirul Hajj (leader of the
Pilgrimage), which went with the caravans of the pilgrims.

Trading Facilities
Every city had a committee of merchants and it was not compulsory
for government officials to be part of the committee. The merchants
themselves fixed the rates of commodities. Taxes were nominal on
commodities. In this respect, the merchants did not have any
grievance. They were given more respect than even government
officials. They were welcome to pay visits to the Caliph's court. The
city officials always tried to keep the merchants who brought
commodities from abroad satisfied and pleased. They treated the
merchants who brought commodities from outside as those who had
made a public service. In case the goods were not sold, the official or
the Sultan or the Caliph would buy it even if it was not needed at the
time because they did not like to send the merchant away frustrated.
If a caravan of merchants was looted in the jurisdiction of a particular
administrator or governor, he was considered to be extremely careless

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

607

and worthless. The noblemen of the city used to invite and entertain
the merchants and treat them as honored guests. If a merchant came
from a foreign country, the Caliph himself would invite him to hear
the stories of his journeys and would see him off with gifts and
rewards. This attitude gave great incentives and encouragement to
trade and so it flourished considerable. That was why during the reign
of the Abbasid caliphs all kinds of trade and industry fully developed
and each city came to acquire popularity for a particular industry. In
this way, the products of one place began to be exported to another.
The Arabs had been the traders since ancient times. However, during
the period of the Abbasid caliphs, the Iranians also developed an
interest in trade. It developed to such an extent that the Muslim
traders began to visit the coasts of the northern seas and the northern
and southern parts of Africa, anthropologists have discovered Muslim
artifacts manufactured in Baghdad during the period of the Abbasid
caliphs in Sweden and Madagascar. Some caliphs for instance Wathiq
Billah, exempted foreign merchants from paying taxes and he levied
no taxes on imports.

Government Tax Collectors
Instead of collecting money on cultivated or agricultural produce,
share distribution was used. Forty percent of the produce was given to
the government tax collector while sixty percent was left with the
farmer. If the farmer had to work using irrigation, seventy five percent
of the produce was left for him and twenty five percent was the
government tax. On some agricultural products, only twenty percent
was collected as tax and eighty percent was left to the farmer. On
grape and date orchards, the tax was levied in cash on the basis of
share distribution basis. In some provinces like Bahrain, Iraq and
Jazirah, there were farmers on whose lands tax was fixed by
agreement at the time of victory during the period of the first Caliphs.
That was considered a permanent settlement and no enhancements
could be made on it. At the time of fixing taxes, most of the lands were
left tax-free and the farmers were exempted from paying taxes for the
slightest reason. The government took special care to see that the
farmers were happy and prosperous so that the population and the

608

The History of Islam

prosperity of the territory would not suffer. A very large area of the
territories collected only ten percent of the produce as tax. The
Dhimmis who were not recruited in the army and the protection of
whose lives rested on the government used to pay a nominal tax to
cover military expenditures. Those who willingly joined the arrriy
were exempted from the payment of Jizya. There was conscription for
the Muslims. The old and children among the Dhimmis were
exempted. The Muslims had to pay another tax called Sadaqat (form
of charity) while the wealthy among them had to pay the Zakat (this is
the obligatory tax on wealthy Muslims), which could be called a
wealth tax.

Government Expenditures
Along the Roman borders, the armies were stationed permanently in
cantonments. They used to get higher pay than the other armies. One
army always remained in the capital. One part of the army was
deputed along the roads for safety and distributed over thousands of
outposts. A good number of soldiers were kept in major cities and
other central and key places. The police that worked under the
command of the 'Mohtasib' and under the authority of the Chief of
Police received their salaries from the government treasury. Th~ major
portion of the treasury was spent for the armies. That included the
police of the postal department, horses and camels and the workers in
the postal department. The militiamen who were requited to
participate in the Roman border wars received their food, horses and
other essential things from the government. In their absence cash and
salaries or foodstuff were given to the members of their families. In
times of war, the entire load and provision of the army fell on the
government treasury. The chain of battles with the Romans continued
and it led the caliphs to found cities and construct forts along the
Roman borders. All the expenses of the armies of the provinces had to
be borne by the treasuries of the provinces. However, the expenses of
the armies on the Roman borders, security of Baghdad and the rest of
Iraq, armed soldiers for postal safety, the Caliph's personal army and
the militiamen all were paid by the Caliph's central treasury. Every
new Caliph coming to the throne used to reward the army.

609

Important workers were awarded feudal estates and their salaries
were fixed. In addition to construction of cities and forts, schools,
bridges, canals, wells and mosques were continuously being built.
Manufacturers, inventors and craftsmen were given bonuses and
salaries, which encouraged them considerably and inspired others.
Holistic doctors, medical doctors, poets, scholars and legal experts
were amply rewarded and honored. Some Christian and Jewish
doctors grew so rich in Baghdad that except the Caliph no one else
excelled them in wealth. There were many schools in Baghdad the
expenses of which were met with great royal liberality. In the same
way there were high quality Halls of Knowledge in other cities.
Factories for manufacturing arms, clothing, sugar, medicines and
perfumes were set up in big cities and the government patronized
them. Owing to the Caliph's special attention mills for making silken
and woolen cloths and factories for manufacturing glass utensils made
rapid progress. The Caliph had to have readily available with him in
the treasury thousands of royal robes, shawls, woolen clothes,
beautiful ceremonial dresses, costly swords, spears, shields and bows
in order to reward and honor the extremely brave, the scholars,
manufacturers and inventors. He used to purchase valuable and
precious objects brought into the country by foreign traders and
deposited them into his treasury and distribute them among the
people as gifts and rewards.

Military Preparedness
The total strength of the army varied at different times. There were a
number of armies. Each army was made up of ten thousand soldiers.
Its chief was called Amir of the army. He had ten commanders under
him and each of them had one thousand soldiers under his command .
Each commander had ten deputies and each deputy had one hundred
soldiers under him. Similarly, each deputy had ten sergeants and each
sergeant had ten soldiers under his command. Sometimes the caliphs
brought about some changes in the uniform of the army in accordance
with their tastes. For instance, Motasim had lace sewn to the uniform
of the Turk army. Sometimes the military uniforms were of costly
brocade. A huge number of camels and mules for carrying equipment
accompanied them. The army had spears, swords and shields with

610

The History of Islam

them and was called 'Harbiah' (fighting army). The army that carried
bows and arrows with it besides swords and shields was known as
'Ramiah' (shooting or throwing army) . Each soldier had a helmet, iron
armlets, gloves and socks. Every army had a team of engineers,
physicians and surgeons. It carried with it stocks of medicine and all
the necessary pharmaceuticals and other paraphernalia required for
their mobile hospital with means of carrying the injured. Each army
had a cavalry made up of veteran spearmen and archers.
When the caliphate grew weaker and Banu Buwayh became
dominant, the custom of granting feudal estates to the army chiefs
began and they were allowed to collect their salaries from the
government collector of revenues who obtained the funds from that
particular tract of land. This practice opened the door to the
perpetration of atrocities on the farmers. When the Seljuks came into
power, they introduced the custom that every administrator and every
ruler was considered to be a general and they_ were supposed to be
ready with an army in proportion to the collection of revenue from
that part of the country. In other words, the army chiefs were made up
of independent feudal lords by being the owner of part of the country
their duty was to come with a fixed number of soldiers in times of
emergency. The government of the whole territory thus came into the
hands of the army chiefs and the old administrators and former feudal
lords lost their power. The army had nothing to do with the royal
treasury, the army chiefs had the authority to collect their salaries
from their lands and property and to reduce ot increase them as they
saw fit. With his back to the wall the Caliph with the loss of revenue
had to reduce the number of his soldiers leading ultimately and
automatically to the seizure of power by the Sultans. When the Seljuks
became weaker, the Caliph of Baghdad captured Iraq and directly
increased his revenue and introduced again the old practice of
separating the army from the administrative and managing functions.

Educadona! Developments
The Baitul Hikmah (House of Wisdom) had been established in
Baghdad in the time of Haroon Rasheed. During Mamoon' s, regime a
big department began the work of translating Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

611

and Persian books. The Caliph arranged debates and academic
discussions and participated in them. The scholars used to meet at the
residences of the rulers, ministers and other important persons. Academic
issues were hotly debated and listeners' minds would be highly
illuminated. Just as a number of scholars were busy writing, compiling
and translating books there was and equal number of them copying
books. Booksellers were held in great esteem and busied themselves in
copying books. They kept a number of copyists and calligraphers
engaged in this work. People undertook journeys to distant lands for
academic research and acquisition of knowledge and they proved
themselves to be an invaluable asset to tl1eir countrymen and the royal
court on their return. Ilmun Nahwa (Arabic grammar) was developed
during the period of the Abbasid caliphate and many books were
written on this subject. People penned books on travels. Ilmul Ahadith
(Science of the traditions of the Prophet~) were compiled and edited.
Books on the 'Usool (rules of principles) Ahadith were written. Similarly
thousands of books on Ilmul Kalam, Ilmul Fiqah (Islamic Law) and
Ilmul Orood' were written. Not only in Baghdad but also in all the
major cities and territories, authors were engaged in scholarly pursuits.
Very valuable books on medicine, physics, surgery and anatomy were
written and published. Medicine shops were first started during this
period. Similarly, the credit of systematizing and compiling the art of
written history belongs to the same period. The Abbasids are also
credited with very important discoveries in astronomy.
Mamoon Rasheed had the distance of one degree measured on the
surface of the earth and thereby proved twice that the circumference
of the earth was 24 thousands miles. He had observatories constructed
and books written on the art of building. The telescope and the watch
were also inventions of the Abbasid period. Remarkable · books on
mysticism, morality and theology were authored during this period.
Not only were books on mathematics, chemistry, geology, zoology,
botany and logic written but also the Muslims established these
sciences. To fully do justice to the ~cholastic achievements of Muslims
during this period would require a separate voluminous book. In
these academic developments, the Umayyah caliphate of Andalusia
did not lag behind and was the forerunner of many of the world' s
modern sciences.

612

The History of Islam

Part Two
We have examined until this point in the narrative the life of the
Prophet (~) and we have read in detail the conditions and the
situations concerning the rightly guided Caliphs. No one after the
Prophet (~ ) was permitted by Islamic law to inherit his property
based on his relationship with him (Jli:) or become the ruler or Caliph
of the government founded by him (~ ), and this decision was taken in
keeping with Islamic teachings. Each of the rightly guided Caliphs
had sons and those sons were very capable but none of the caliphs
wanted to nominate their sons nor did the rule and government
become an inheritance in their families. Only afti=r Ali (4,,), his son
Hasan ~
was made Caliph by the people of Kufa . After six months,
he handed the caliphate and the government over to Amir Mu'awiyah
(~ )- What Amir Mu'awiyah (~ ) did was to nominate his son as his
successor and instead of on his own accord giving it to a person
chosen by the majority of the Muslims, he handed the Islamic
government to his descendent as a personal inherited right. Never the
less he did not officially say th.at the Islamic government was the
property of a single individual family and so he tried to have all the
Muslims agree to take the oath for Yazeed. This act of Amir
Mu'awiyah (~) caused the Muslims of that period to struggle hard to
remedy it and this brought about the disaster at Karbala. lt was due to
these efforts that Abdullah bin Zubair ~ was made Caliph and Amir
Mu'awiyah's family was deprived of the Islamic government. Along
with Mu'awiyah's act the Jew Abdullah bin Saba' s anti Islamic
conspiracy proved effective in disturbing the basic system of Islamic
rule. First, the inner mistake, which was attributed to Mu' awiyah (~ )
and secondly the external opposition, which was called Saba's
conspiracy combined and turned into a great trial or evil disorder by
being presented as Islamic. The result was that this Islamic pillar of
government was pushed off its foundation and it also became the
target for disaster by anti Islamic forces. The Marwani caliphs
strengthened the evil practice of succession and nomination of the
future ruler and this enabled those incapable of beneficial rule to hold
the caliphate. It dealt a fatal blow to the awe and grandeur of Islamic

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

613

rule and in parallel allowed a series of struggles to begin that took
advantage of Saba's moves aimed against the Islamic sultanate.
Finally, the Abbasids captured the caliphate from the Umayyah
caliphs and it marked the beginning of division in the Islamic
government. Before the Abbasids Banu Umayyah ruled over the entire
Islamic world with a single center and a single caliphate. However, in
the beginning of the reign of the Abbasids in Spain a separate
Umayyah government was formed that was out of the jurisdiction of
the Abbasid caliphs. Then Morocco, North Africa and other territories
established separate Islamic governments. After discussing the
caliphate of Banu Umayyah, we have finished discussing the Abbasid
caliphate leaving the other governments that were founded separately
during the period of the Abbasid caliphate and in the third volume we
shall study them. It is appropriate here in order to bring the continuity
of events and subjects into perspective to give a short description of
these ruling dynasties.

Spain
The Muslims conquered Spain and established their government in 93
A.H. and it was a province of the caliphs of Banu Umayyah. Until 138
A.H., like all other provinces Amirs and administrators were
appointed by the rulers on behalf of the Banu Umayyah caliphs. When
the Abbasids destroyed the Umayyah government and took it over,
the tenth Caliph of the Umayyahs Hisham's grandson Abdur Rahman
somehow escaped the bloodthirsty swords of the Abbasids and reached
Spain and founded his government there in 138 A.H. When the Abbasid
army attacked him, he repulsed and defeated them. He made the
Spanish city Qurtabah (Cordoba) his capital and began his magnificent
rule. This rule continued in his family until 422 A.H. The pomp and
dignity and the power and greatness of these Spanish caliphs threw the
entire continent of Europe into deep consternation and their love of
knowledge and culture won them international praise and admiration.
Their feats and achievements are more interesting and instructive than
those of Banu Abbas. In 422 A.H., there began a state of anarchy in
Spain and it led to the down fall and end of the grand caliphate of the
Umayyah dynasty. After that, Spain was divided into small Muslim
states and they made cities like Cordoba, Seville, Granada and Valencia

614

The History of Islam

their capitals. After a short time, the Muslim Kingdoms of Africa
brought most of Spain under their subjugation. The Christian Kings took
advantage of the civil wars raging among the Muslims inciting the
Muslims to fight among themselves and when they became extremely
weak, the Christian conquerors of Spain subjected them to a repression
that no nation had been subjected to or had been inflicted on the face of
humanity. The history of Spain makes the Muslims shed tears of blood.
The story of the ruin of the Spanish Muslims has the power of
wounding the hearts and minds of the believers.

The Sultanate of ldrisid in Morocco
In 172 A.H. Morocco became separated from the Abbasid caliphate
and an independent government was formed . Though this sultanate
was in the neighborhood of Spain, it was opposed to the Spanish
caliphate as it was to the Abbasid caliphate. It lasted for about 200
years. The Idrisi Kings ruled for 100-125 years and then the Obeidis
started ruling in North Africa. Finally, it was divided in several parts
and after surviving as ordinary rulers and chiefs their rule ended.

The Sultanate of Aghlabia in North Africa
In 184 A.H., the province of North Africa (Tunis) separated from the
Abbasids and the descendents of Ibrahim Aghlabs governed with
great pomp and dignity for more than 100 years. In 219 A.H., the
sultanate of Aghlab captured the Island of Sicily from the Christians
and annexed it to its own territory and continued to rule over it until
the end of their dynasty. There were a few very courageous and able
rulers in this dynasty. When the Obeidis (Fatimids) revolted, they
founded their sultanate on the bases formed by the Aghlabs. They
seized the Idrisi government and made the Aghlab's capital of
Qairwan their own capital. Egypt came under their control and then
they moved their capital to Egypt. The history of the Aghlab
government is move interesting than that of the Idrisi. It met its end in
296 A.H. This dynasty conquered not only Sicily but also Malta and
Sarp.inia. They had a powerful naval force and they dominated the
Mediterranean Sea. At times, their fleets attacked and looted the
coasts of Greece, Italy and France.

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

615

The Sultanate of Ziyad in Yemen
In 203 A.H., Muhammad bin Ziyad who was a descendant from Ziyad
bin Abi Sufian, was appointed as the governor of Yemen. His dynasty
continued to rule in Yemen until 402 A.H. Muhammad bin Ziyad
founded the city of Zubaid and made it his capital. He conquered the
province of Tahama adjacent to Yemen and he captured Hadramut
also. There were a few very lucky and powerful Kings in this dynasty.
In 288 A.H., the Alawis took a part of his territory and founded the
Zaidiyah government. The borders of this sultanate continued to
shrink. Though the Zaidiyah sultanate was independent, the names of
the Abbasid caliphs were read in the Friday sermons there. Besides
Zaidiyah when another independent government was established in a
part of Yemen, they removed the names of the Abbasids from their
Friday sermons. When the Zaidiyah sultanate grew weak, their slaves
and slaves of the slaves began to rule. After that, a number of dynasties
ruled in Yemen one after another. After the Zaidiyah there followed
the Yafuriah, Najahiah, Sailhiah, Hamdaniah, Mahdiah, Zoriah,
Ayyubiah, Rasooliah and the Tahriah dynasties which ruled
independently until 1000 A.H. Some of these dynasties were Shia and
some were Sunni. Their histories have nothing remarkable about them.

The Sultanate of Tahir Husain in Khorasan
Mamoon Rasheed Abbasid appointed Tahir bin Husain as the
governor in Khorasan in 205 A.H. After that, this dynasty ruled for 50
years in Khorasan. The Tahir dynasty established Khorasan as a
separate entity from Baghdad and from that time on they thought
themselves independent from Baghdar rule,but the rulers of the Tahir
dynasty regarded themselves as subordinate to the Caliph of Baghdad
and read his name in the Friday sermons but the Caliph's court did
not interfere in the affairs of Khorasan.

The Saffar Dynasty in Khorasan and Iran
In 254 A.H., Yaqub bin Laith Saffar captured Iran and separated it
from the Abbasid caliphate. In 259 A.H., he brought under his control

616

The History of Islam

Khorasan as well and put an end to the Tahir government. The Saffar
dynasty governed for about 40 years and then the Samania
government did away with them. Whatever has been stated about the
Tahir and Saffar dynasties in the previous pages is sufficient for our
purposes and these two dynasties will not be included in the coming
volume.

The Samania Dynasty in Mawaraunnahr and Khorasan
Some things have been said about the Samanis above when the
Samani government of Mawaraunnahr took away Khorasan from the
Saffaris and Tabristan from the Alawis, its jurisdiction extended from
Mawaraunnahr (including the cities of Samarkand and Bukhara) to
the gulf of Iran and the Caspian Sea. From that time, Mawaraunnahr
was free from the authority of the Abbasid caliphate. The Samani
dynasty ruled for 125 years. Their contribution to the development of
arts and sciences, culture and civilization is appreciable. Bukhara and
Samarkand became centers of the arts and sciences and these cities
were the birthplace of scholars of such repute that the world still
remembers them. After about half a century, Khorasan, Iran and
Tabristan slipped out of the control of the Samani rulers. The Buyid
dynasty established their domination over this region and over threw
the Samanis. Turk slaves of this dynasty became dominant and the
Buyids downfall started approaching fast. In 384 A.H., a Turk slave of
this dynasty Alptageen captured part of the Samani territory. Between
380 A.H. and 389 A.H., the Turks captured the remainder of the
Samani territory and ended the Buyid dynasty. The history of the
Samani government is even more interesting because this sultanate
helped in the establishment of Alptageen's sultanate and Alptageen's
successor was Subaktaggen whose son Mahmood Ghaznavi, remains
an interesting and captivating figure for the students of Asian history.

The Sultanate of Qaramata in Bahrain
In 286 A.H., the provinces of Bahrain were separated from the
Abbasid caliphate and Qaramata established his own kingdom there.
He made the people's lives a hell through his repressive measures. His
tyrannies and misdeeds will be recorded in a separate chapter. His
rule in Bahrain lasted until 364 A.H. after that other dynasties took

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

617

control of Bahrain and a number of independent states began to rule
there and in the provinces of that area.

The Sultanate of Alawis in Tabristan
From 250 A.H. to 316 A.H., Zaidi Alawi ruled in Tabristan. The
Samanis annihilated them and yet several rivals kept fighting with
one another in the region and they helped in the establishment of the
Buyid dynasty, which has been discussed in the previous pages.

The Province of Sindh In 265 A.H., the province of Sindh became independent from the
Abbasid caliphate and two independent Muslim kingdoms were
established, one having its capital in Multan and the other in Mansoora.
The southern part of Sindh formed part of the sultanate of Mansoora
while the northern part was ruled over the sultanate of Multan. Small
states like Tooran, Qasdar, Kaikanan, Makran, and Mushki were
established by Arab chiefs who had recognized the authority of the
bigger states and paid taxes to them. In this way, the whole of Sindh
became independent of the Caliph of Baghdad but his name continued
to be read in the Friday sermons there. These states began to grow
weaker and in 100-125 years time they were extinct. However, the state
of Multan survived until Mahmood Ghaznavi invaded India .

The Buyid or Buwayhid Dynasty
The Buyids or Dailamis reigned in Iran and Iraq from 322 A.H. to 447
A.H ., approximately 125 years. Instead of declaring independence
from the Caliph's rule, the Buyids dominated the Caliph and captured
the province of Iraq and finished the Abbasid caliphate both literally
and figuratively . They however, spared the Caliph's name and the
caliphate in name.
The blow that was dealt to the dignity and reliability of the Abbasid
caliphate by the Buyids has been stated briefly in the previous pages.
They imposed themselves on the Caliph and he became their puppet.
The Buyids have found mention with the history of the Abbasids and
no further details about them are needed in coming pages.

618

The History of Islam

The Sultanate of Tuloon in Egypt
Ibn Tuloon has bean mentioned previously. Bani Tuloon ruled on
Egypt from 254 A.H. to 292 A.H. Though he was independent and the
province of Egypt was virtually separated from the Abbasid caliphate
in 254 A.H., in the Friday sermon the name of the Caliph of Baghdad
continued to be read in Egypt. Bani Tuloon annexed Syria to their
government. Their kingdom in Egypt and Syria claimed to be loyal to
the Caliph of Baghdad but they had cut off the court of Baghdad from
any involvement in the Egyptian and Syrian governments.

The Sultanate of Akhshidiah in Egypt and Syria
When the government of Bani Tuloon ended in Egypt and Syria, the
Governors of both the provinces began to come from the Caliph's
court for sometime and both the provinces appeared to become a part
of the Abbasid caliphate again. In 316 A.H ., the Caliph of Baghdad,
Moqtadir Billah, appointed Muhammad bin Tafaj governor of Ramla.
In 318 A.H., he was made the ruler of Damascus followed by Egypt in
323 A.H. Muhammad bin Tafaj belonged to an ancient ruling dynasty
of Farghana of Mawaraunnahr. The chiefs of Farghana were then
called Akhshid. Muhammad bin Tafaj captured the Egyptian throne
and announced his autonomy in 327 A.H . and chose the title Akhshid.
In 330 A.H., he conquered Syria and in 331 A.H. annexed the Hijaz to
his Kingdom and founded his dynasty. In so doing, he faced no
hardship because the Buyids had made the Caliph's court powerless
and ineffective. The fear and awe of the Caliph had left the public's
hearts. The Akhshid dynasty ruled over these countries until 356 A.H.
when the Fatimids conquered Egypt and later Syria.

The Sultanate of Obeidi (Fatimids) in Egypt, North
Africa and Syria
In 296 A.H ., the Aghlab dynasty ended in North Africa (Tunis)
yielding to the Obeidi dynasty. In 356 A.H., the Obeidis took Egypt
from a minor of the Akhshid dynasty and made Cairo their capital
and constructed the defensive walls of the city. In 381 A.H., the
Obeidis captured Aleppo and in a short time, their government

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

619

extended from the Moroccan border to Syria. The Obeidis left
Qairwan and made Cairo their capital, the islands in the
Mediterranean. Sea and the western districts could no longer be held
under their control but their superiority in the eastern part of the
Mediterranean Sea was established and the eastern conquests
compensated for their western losses. Most of the western territories
that they lost went under the Christian's control and they latter took
the eastern territories from the Muslims. The advent of the Obeidis in
Egypt benefited the Christians and put the Muslims at loss. The
Obeidis also claimed the caliphate and took the oath from those under
their occupation and they were called Caliph by their subjects. Thus,
three lines of the caliphate became established in the world. The
foremost and the longest is that which was established by Abu Bakr
Siddiq ~ and ended with the last Caliph of the Ottoman dynasty
Sultan Abdul Majeed. The first part is called the rightly guided
caliphs, the second the Umayyah dynasty, the third is the Abbasid
dynasty, the fourth is the Abbasids of Egypt and the fifth is the
Ottoman Empire. We have finished four parts of this long chain. The
fifth part will follow. The second separate line of the caliphate began
from the period of Abdul Rahman III in Spain and ended with that
dynasty. The majority of Islamic scholars have recognized this line of
the caliphate as lawful. They regarded the caliphs of Spain as the
caliphs of Islam, that is, obedience to them by the Muslims living in
their regions was considered obligatory. The third separate line of the
caliphate was started by the Obeidis (Fatimids) and has not been
recognized as a true line by the scholars of Islam. They recognize them
neither as caliphs nor do they regard them as deserving honor. They
introduced partnership with Allah and evil innovations, desecrated
Islamic worship and committed many kinds of misdeeds. The rule of
the Obeidis lasted until 567 A.H. Then Sultan Salahuddin Ayyubi
ended this dynasty, founded the Ayyubi dynasty and reintroduced
the mention of the Abbasid caliphs in the Friday sermons in Egypt.

Daulatul Hamdan in Mosul, ]azirah and Syria
Abul Hija Abdullah bin Hamdan bin Hamdoon bin Harith bin
Luqman bin Asad bin Hazam founded an independent state in the
provinces of Mosul in 289 A.H. and for about 100 years Banu Hamdan

620

The History of Islam

governed in Jazirah and Syria. They continued the Friday sermon in
the name of the Abbasid caliphs in their territories. Prominent rulers
among them were Saifuddaulah and Nasiruddaulah who ruled in
Syria and Mosul respectively. They had taken the greater parts of
Syria from Banu Akhshid and captured Jazirah too. They fought the
Buyids that is, the Dailamis, a number of times and they gave them a
good fight. Sometimes they got the better of the Caliph, who in that
period of course was the puppet of the Buyids or Dailamis. During
their regime, the issue of offensive and defensive responsibility
against the Romans had nothing to do with the Caliph's court. Banu
Hamdan alone invaded the Romans and retaliated against their
attacks. Among these, Saifuddaulah led successful wars against the
Romans and received much recognition in this respect. Finally, only
Syria remained under their control and Hamadan' s government went
under the control of their slaves who introduced the Obeidis name in
the Frida y sermon in Syria and ultimately this government met its end
in 380 A.H. Banu Aqil bin Kab bin Rabiah bin Amir established his
rule in Mosul and captured the province of Jazirah. After that, several
Arab chiefs established their kingdoms in small territories in these
areas. They lived under the auspices of some bigger power in name
only and sometimes they declared their independence until the Seljuks
captured Baghdad and dominated all of Iraq and then the Seljuks
deputed their own governors or established their own direct rule.

The Government of Banu Sulaiman in Makkah
The Caliph of Baghdad used to appoint Governors to Makkah. But in
301 A.H., Muhammad bin Sulaiman who descended from Sulaiman
bin Dawood bin Hasan Muthanna bin Hasan bin Ali bin Abi Talib
founded an independent government (Muharnmad bin Sulaiman
should not be confused with Sulaiman bin Dawood's son because
between these two Sulaiman's there are probably two or three more).
The State lasted until 430 A.H. During these 125 yea rs, there were
many fights and battles. Four or five persons of this dynasty ruled in
Makkah. It was a strange sort of rule. During the Hajj season, the
caravans from Egypt and Baghdad arrived and quarreled over
reading the Friday sermon. They attached no importance to the
Governor of Makkah. If the Amirul Hajj of Baghdad dominated, he

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

621

used to read the names of the Buyids and the Caliph of Baghdad. If
the Egyptian Amirul Hajj got the better of the one from Baghdad, he
used to read the name of Banu Akhshid in the Friday sermon. When
the Obeidis (Fatimids) emerged victorious in Egypt, the Obeidis and
the Abbasids would fight over the Friday sermon. When the
Qararnata held power, they slew the Hujjaj and looted Makkah and
the pilgrims caravans. Sometimes when the Egyptians desecrated
the black stone and hurled stones and abuse on it, the Iraqis flew
into a rage and started putting them to sword. During the same
period, the Qaramata removed the black stone, carried it away to
Bahrain and returned it to Makkah only after 20 or more years. In
brief, during the Hajj time no trace of any rule of Banu Sulaiman
was found in Makkah. They were Zaidi Shias and so they were
naturally inclined to the Obeidis but they surrendered to whoever
was more powerful.

The State of Hashimites in Makkah
After the Banu Sulaiman, Abu Hashim Muhammad bin Hasan bin
Muhammad bin Musa bin Abdullah bin Abi Alkaram bin Musa's
descendents began to rule in Makkah. They lived as rulers of Makkah
like Banu Sulaiman. They started reading the name of the Caliph of
Baghdad in the Friday sermon in the beginning of the Seljuk period.
When the Seljuk Sultans became weak near their end the Hashirns
began to read the names of the Obeidi rulers in the Friday sermon.
When Sultan Salahuddin Ayyubi wiped out the Obeidi (Fatimid)
government in 567 A.H., the Hashims of Makkah became extinct as
the Hijaz and Yemen came under Salahuddin's control and the
Governors of Makkah were appointed by his dynasty. After some
time Banu Qatadah established their rule in Makkah followed by Banu
Nami and others until the Ottomans conquered the Hijaz and the
Ottoman Sultan began to appoint the rulers of Makkah known as the
Sharif of Makkah. Then in times that are more recent, Sharif Husain
rebelled again.st the Ottomans and did great damage to the Islamic
government by turning himself into the focus of hatred and
humiliation. of the entire Islamic world. He recognized the so-called
Christian. superiority and brought disgrace on the Hashimites.

622

The History of Islam

The State of Marwaniya in Dayar Bakr
Abu Ali bin Marwan was a Kurd. He founded an independent
government in Dayar Bakr, which lasted, in his family over 100 years
from 380 A.H. to 489 A.H. The cities of Amad, Arzan, Miafareqeen
and Kaifah were included in this state. They were loyal to the Obeidis
of Egypt and the Obeidis made them the rulers of Halab this bringing
them on par with the Hamdanis. They showed allegiance to the Buyid
dynasty too. An invasion by the Seljuks put and end to them.

The Sultanate of Ghaznaviya in Afghanistan
It has been stated above that Alptageen had established a separate
kingdom by capturing the southern part of the Samani sultanate. Then
his son-in-law Subuktageen succeeded him as the ruler. Mahmood
Ghaznavi was his son. This dynasty reigned from 351 A.H. to 552
A.H. During Mahmood Ghaznavi' s regime, the length, breath and
power of this sultanate reached its zenith. It extended from the Punjab
and Multan in India to the western edge of Khorasan and from the
Persian Gulf to the river Jejune. He invaded the territory up to
Samarkand and Bukhara, he launched offensives against Kalinjer
(Bengal) and Somnath on the other side. When this dynasty was in
decline, the Khwarizm Shahs captured Khorasan while Afghanistan
and Punjab were conquered by the Ghauri dynasty. The Ghaznavi
dynasty was always loyal to the Caliph of Baghdad. During the
regime of Sultan Mahmood Ghaznavi, the Seljuks came out of their
ancestral lands of western China and settled in the plains of Bukhara
and gradually they spread up to Asia Minor. Mahmood Ghaznavi had
conquered the territories up to Mawaraunnahr.

Seljuk Dynasty
The rule of the Seljuks lasted for about 270 years from 430 A.H . to 700
A.H. Its beginning was·very magnificent but at the end it was divided
into many parts. From the beginning, they were divided into many
sects. Their longest hereditary line was the one that included kings of
international repute like Alp Arsalan and Malik Shah Seljuk. They are

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

623

called the Seljuk of Iran. A brief account about them has been given
above. A detailed account will follow next. Besides them, the Seljuk of
Kerman, Seljuk of Iraq, Seljuk of Syria, Seljuk of Rome (modern day
Turkey) are also well known. The histories of all these dynasties are
not without interest. After these there followed the sultanates of their
slaves and the Atabaks (slave teachers or tutors). They also add
richness and grandeur to our Islamic history. The Seljuks appeared on
the horizon at a time when the repressions of the Dailamis (Buyids)
had humiliated and weakened the caliphate in Baghdad. The Islamic
government was torn to pieces and they established separate and
independent kingdoms as we have read above. The S~ljuks restored
the lost glory of the Abbasid caliphate unseated many small dynasties
from power and rule and resuscitated the Caliph's greatness and
dignity in a grand and powerful government. The Seljuks power was
based on their military and martial prowess, they let the army chiefs
run the country's administration and government. It soon was in
disarray and all the Seljuk chiefs vying with each other helped bring
ba_ck the past anarchy by capturing provinces and states separately
and independently. The Seljuks were new converts but they were the
embodiment of sincerity and free from the conspiring and intriguing of
the Alawis. They had many opportunities to serve the cause of Islam.
They served the cause of religious knowledge and encouraged noblehearted people as much as they could. They held in greatest esteem
the Abbasid caliphs simply because they thought they deserved it in
view of the old traditions of Islam. They remained quite unaffected by
the rivalries of Abbasids, Umayyahs and Alawis. They neither hated
one sect nor did they love the other unjustifiably. They were simple,
straightforward and true Muslims. They fought the Christians tooth
and nail and established the superiority of the Muslims' swords on the
hearts of the Christians and pushed back their on rushing flood with
authority. It was due to their rule that the government of the Abbasid
caliphs survived until the end. The cause of their downfall was the same
that brings down every nation, internal dissensions and bickering.
The Seljuks power as has already been stated, was a military one their
power was dependent on the army. lts officers were Turk slaves who
were brought from the forests of Qaichaq and purchased. The Seljuk

624

The History of Islam

Sultans trusted them most. They never doubted their loyalty. When
those slaves grew disciplined and became chiefs, they proved to be
extremely brave and faithful. The Seljuk Sultans assigned their slave
chiefs as tutors to their young princes and the princes learned manners
under their tutelage and that was why they called those slave-tutors
Atabak. The word Atabak in Turkish language means an Amir who
may be taken as the father's deputy. When the Seljuk Sultans became
powerless after years of in fighting, those slaves or Atabaks found
opportunities and established their own governments in different
territories. Taftageen, Seljuk Tatash's slave, was appointed tutor to
Tatash's minor son Wafaq Seljuk and became the ruler of Tatash's
government after Wafaq and began to rule in Damascus. Emaduddin
Zangi, Sultan Malik Shah slave's son, founded an Atabak state in Mosul
and Aleppo. The Seljuk Sultan of Iraq Masood had a Qaichaqi slave. He
established an Atabak sultanate ir Azerbaijan. Sultan Malik Shah had a
slave named Anustageen among whose descendents were the kings of
Khwarizm Shahia. Similarly, there was an Atabak chief name Salfar
who founded an Atabak government in Iran. In brief, by the sixth
century A.H. all the Seljuk countries were captured and ruled over by
Seljuk army chiefs.

The Atabaks of Syria and Iran
Malik Shah's Turk slave was Ak Sanfar who was his Hajib also. He
was assigned as the ruler in Syria and Iraq. In 521 A.H., Ak Sanfar's
son Emaduddin took over as the Governor of Iraq and the same year
he annexed Mosul, Sanfar, Jazirah and Harran to his kingdom. In 522
A.H., he brought into his possession major parts of Syria. Emaduddin
waged holy wars against the Romans and endeared himself to the
world of Islam. His son Nuruddin Mahmood succeeded him as the
ruler of Syria while his second son Saifuddin took Iraq. Nuruddin
Mahmood out did his father in launching holy wars against the
Romans and achieved even greater fame. After him, his family was
torn into several groups. The Ayyubi dynasty was a branch of the
same family as the Emaduddin Zangi dynasty, which continued to
rule for 125 years.

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

625

The Atabaks of Arbela (lrbil}
Among Emaduddin Zangi's Turk officers was one named Zain Ali
Kochak bin Buktageen who served as his deputy in Mosul. In 539
A.H., he annexed Sanjar, Harran, Takrait and lrbil (ancient: Arbela) to
his kingdom and made !rbil his capital and established an
independent government. It continued under his family's rule until
630 A.H . After that, it went directly under the control of t]1e Caliph in
Baghdad.

The Atabaks of Deyar Bakr
Artooq bin Aksab Seljuk was an army officer. His son El Ghazi
founded his own government in 495 A.H . The government remained
with this family in name only until Timur's times. They were loyal to
the rulers of Sultan Salahuddin Ayyubi.

The Atabaks of Armenia
Qutbuddin Seljuk' s slave Salman Qutbi took the city of Khalat from
the Marwani kingdom and established his own sultanate in 493 A.H.
His descendents continued to rule until 604 A.H. when the Ayyubi
sultanate conquered it.

The Atabaks of Azerbaijan
Sultan Masood's Qaichaqi slave Alizkaz established his own
government in Azerbaijan that lasted for a hundred years from 531
A.H. to 632 A.H.

The Atabaks of Iran
the chief of a group of Turks was named Salfhar. He joined the
supporters of Tughral Baig Seljuk. One of his descendents Sanfar bin
Maudood captured Iran in 543 A.H. His family continued to rule in
Iran until 686 A.H. A ruler of this dynasty, Atabak Sad, began to pay
taxes to Khwarizm Shah. It was after his name that Sheikh
Muslehuddin Shirazi chose his title Sadi for his famous book. Atabak
Abu Bakr succeeded Atabak Sad. He was loyal to Ektai Khan of the

626

The History of Islam

Mongols. It was this Atabak Abu Bakr whom Sadi has referred to in
his masterpiece Gulsitan.

The Atabaks of Laristan (near the Arabian Gulf in Iran)
The founder of this dynasty was Atabak Tahir who was a chief of the
Atabaks of Iran. The year Sanqar bin Maudood captured Iran, Atabak
Tahir was sent to conquer Laristan. He captured Laristan and
established his rule there in 543 A.H., which lasted until 740 A.H. One
of the branches of this dynasty continued to govern in Laristan until
the tenth century A.H.

The Atabaks of the Khwarizm Shahia
Anwastageen was a Turk slave of Bulgatageen Ghaznavi who became
Malik Shah's water supplier. Malik Shah appointed him as the ruler of
Khwarizm (Khiva). Then his son Khwarizm Shah succeeded him. He
extended his Kingdom up to the bank of the river Jejune and captured
Khorasan and Isfahan. Khwarizm Shah's son Aladdin Muhammad
conquered Bukhara and Samarkand in 607 A.H. and then extended
their territory to include a major part of Afghanistan up to Ghazneen.
Then he became a Shia and decided to uproot and wipe out the
Abbasid caliphate. He just had begun his plan when Genghis Khan
invaded and threw him into a defensive posture. The Mongols
pursued him and he continued to evade them until he died on an
island in the Caspian Sea in 617 A.H. He left three sons who continued
to evade the Mongols. One of them Jalaluddin Khwarizm fled to India
and after living there for two years went back to fight against the
Mongols. Ultimately the Mongols destroyed their dynasty in 628 A.H.
The Khwarizm Shah's Kingdom began in 470 A.H. and ended in 628
A.H. Their rule was regarded as equal to that of the Seljuks.

The State of Ayyubiah
An account of the Atabaks of Syria and Iraq has been given above.
One of them Emaduddin Zangi appointed a Kurd chief called Ayyub
bin Shadi as governor of the city of Baalbek. Gradually he became an
important leader. Ayyub had a younger brother Sherkoh. When
Emaduddin died and his son Nuruddin Mahmood Zangi succeeded

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

627

him as king, he made Sherkoh the ruler of Hims and Rahba. When he
saw his merits and bravery, he made him the supreme commander of
his army . When Nuruddin sent Sherkoh to Egypt, he asked his
nephew Salahuddin Ayyubi to accompany him to Egypt. This has
already been stated. Salahuddin founded his sultanate in 564 A.H.
and Egypt, Syria and the Hijaz were quickly annexed to it. The
kingdom founded by him is known as the Ayyubi Dynasty. This
dynasty continued to rule until 648 A.H. but after Salahuddin it
became divided. One of its branches at Hama survived until 742 A.H.

The Mamluks of Egypt
After the Ayyubi Dynasty of Egypt, the country saw the rise of the
slave kings in 560 A.H. that has been discussed above. They also had
two branches. They were vanquished in 922 A.H. and were replaced
by the Ottomans.
While discussing the Seljuk Sultans we have covered a large area of
history and have to go back to address several popular and powerful
kingdoms, which were, established much earlier for which chronological
references need to be given. So let us leave the eastern territories like
Khorasan, Iraq and Syria and turn our attention to the west.

The Kingdom of the Zeriah of Tunis
When the Obeidi (Fa timid) Dynasty shifted its capital from Qairwan
to Cairo, the whole of North Africa from Egypt to Morocco was under
their jurisdiction at the time. Their naval forces in the Mediterranean
Sea were regarded as superior to all but after the shifting of the capital
to Cairo, its power did not last long over the western territories. The
kingdom of the Zeriah was established in Tunis and it ruled from 362
A.H. to 543 A.H.

The Samadias of Algeria
The dynasty of Samadia established their rule in Algeria and they
governed from 398 A.H. to 547 A.H. Due to the Obeidi's shifting their
capital the Berber tribes in Morocco became independent. They were
destroyed by the dynasty of the Mowahids.

628

The History of Islam

The Kingdom of the Murabitun
During the period of the caliphate of Banu Umayyah, some tribes of
Yemen came and settled in the lands of the Berbers like Tunis,
Algeria and Morocco. By virtue of their teachings, Preachings and
the ideal Islamic way of life they converted the Berbers to Islam. One
of the tribes that lived in Morocco managed to convert the Berbers
that were still unconverted through the sermons of Faqih Abdullah
bin Yaseen of the Maltunah tribe in 448 A.H. They wanted to make
him their leader but he refused and pointed towards a man named
Abu Bakr. The new Muslim Berbers chose Abu Bakr as their leader
and began to address him as Amirul Muslimeen. This assemblage
attracted the neighboring tribes. There was no stable government in
Morocco at the time. There were various tribal territories but none
were dominant. During this anarchy, Abu Bakr's power began to
rise in stage_s. He called his men Murabitun the defending army of
the Islamic border. Abu Bakr inspired them to serve Islam and
motivated them to be very brave. He then moved forward towards
eastern Morocco and conquered Sijilmassa and made his cousin
Yusuf bin Tashfain its governor. Yusuf bin Tashfain was very
religions minded, brave and wise. When Abu Bakr died in 453 A.H.,
Yusuf bin Tashfain became their leader. He founded the city of
Morrocco and made it his capital. In 472 A.H., the Christians
beleaguered the Muslim leaders of Spain by their attacks and the
Muslims of Spain sought help from him. He went to Spain and
broke the backbone of the Christians by defeating them in a major
battle. He left an army of 3,000 Murabitun in Spain for its defense
and returned to Morocco. After four years, the Christians again
attacked the Muslims and they begged Yusuf to help them again. He
defeated the Christians and annexed the Islamic part of Spain to his
government. In short, Spain, Morocco, Tunis, Algeria and Tripoli
were included in the Kingdom of the Murabitun. This dynasty paid
very little attention to naval power. Their rule lasted until 551 A.H.
By virtue of their valiant actions, they rendered the Christians quite
powerless and helpless for a century.

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

629

The Kingdom of the Mowahids
Abu Abdullah Muhammad bin Tumart was from the Berber tribe
Masmuda, they inhabited Sous Mountain (part of the High Atlas
range in southern Morocco), he was known for his profound
knowledge of the Traditions of the Prophet * ' Islamic law, the Arabic
language and literature and he had deep interest in the propagation of
Islam calling to the good and forbidding evil. He made no
discrimination between the rich and the poor in matters of moral
instruction and truthfulness. His austerity made him content with
simple dress and food. There was a group loyal to him and called him
the Mahdi. He enjoyed royal privileges among his followers . Before
his death in 522 A.H., he handed the leadership of his group called
Mowahhadin to his friend Abdul Momin. Abdul Momin rebelled
against the Murabitun and began to conquer territory. Ultimately
within the span of two years, he took most of the territory of the
Murabitun, caused their downfall and sent an army to Spain. After
conquering Spain and Morocco, he called himself Amir al Muminin.
Then in 547 A.H., he conquered Algeria and destroyed the Samadia
dynasty. After the conquest of Tripoli, his Kingdom extended from the
Egyptian border to the Atlantic Ocean including Spain. In 632 A.H.,
the army of the Mowahids received a great setback at the hands of the
Christians and they failed to maintain their rule in Spain. However,
the leaders of Granada continued to fight the Christians. After the loss
of Spain, the dynasty of the Mowahids showed signs of weakness and
decline. Sultan Salahuddin Ayyubi took Tripoli from them then
followed a declaration of independence by the dynasty of the Hafsids
who had ruled as the Mowahids deputies in Tunis and soon after that
Algeria also followed suit. A number of leaders vied for power in
Morocco leading ultimately to the end of this dynasty in 667 A.H. Its
place was taken over by the Marinid Dynasty in Morocco.

Hafsid Dynasty in Tunis
The Mowahids had deputized in Tunis a man named Hafs as the ruler
on their behalf. His family continued to inherit this post for generations.
Finally, it declared its independence in 625 A.H. It ruled honorably for

630

The History of Islam

over three hundred years in Tunis. In 941 A.H., the Ottoman Admiral
Khairuddin (Barbarossa) conquered Tunis and annexed it to the
Ottoman Empire. This was the end of the Hafsids rule.

This Kingdom of Zeyaniah of Algeria
The man who was appointed as Governor by the Mowahids in the
province of Algeria, declared his independence in imitation of the
Hafsid Dynasty in 633 A.H. Their capital was Tlemcen. Their rule
lasted until 796 A.H. when the Moroccan Marinid Dynasty captured
their country.

The Marinid Dynasty of Morocco
The Marinid Dynasty ruled over the mountainous regions of Morocco
from 591 A.H. In 667 A.H ., they captured the Mowahid's territory and
established their rule over all of Morocco. In 796 A.H., this dynasty
was ruined by one of its own branches and in its place two small rival
groups"of Muslims founded their rule.
In this chapter, a few references to some of the eastern territories are
yet to be given, for instance:

The lsmaili Assassins
Imam Jafar Sadiq's son Musa Kazim is considered by all the ten
Imams of the Shia sect to be his father's successor and lmam.
However, Imam Musa Kazim had a brother Imam Ismail. Those who
regard his brother Ismail as Imam are known as lsmailia Shias. The
Obeidi (Fatimid) Dynasty was the greatest government of the Ismaili
Shias. The Ismailis have always taken recourse to secret plotting and
conspiracies in order to achieve their ends. The government of the
Obeidis had already set up a secret intelligence department for the
sake of propagating their beliefs and thoughts and it was through
their missionaries that their message was sent not only to the
territories occupied by them but also to other foreign lands. These
missionaries lived and spread throughout all the Islamic countries as
preachers, spiritual ascetics, traders, and many other guises and

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

631

educated the masses about the lsmaili beliefs. Their blasphemous
teachings were abominable and extremely dangerous. They held that
the Quran was impracticable that Ismail bin Jafar Sadiq was a
prophet. According to them, there were seven Imams. They took the
founder of the Obeidi Dynasty to be the seventh Imam and believed
that obedience of the Obeidi caliphs to be the source of salvation and
more. The efforts of these missionaries did much to benefit and
popularize the Obeidi government.
Hasan bin Sabah was an inhabitant of Rayy. His lineage has been
disputed. Some say he was an Arab by race and that his ancestors had
come from Yemen. Some suggest that he was a magian. Regardless,
his father and his relatives believed in the Shia way. Hasan bin Sabah
was educated at Nishapur. He was the classmate of Omar Khayyam
and Nizamul Mulk Toosi, the Prime Minister of Alp Arsalan and
Malik Shah. He was an extremely intelligent and self respecting man.
He reached Egypt during Mustansir Obeidi's regime. He was
accorded a great reception there. He lived as a royal guest and
companion of Mustansir for over a year in Egypt. After having full
acquaintance with the Ismaili faith he took the oath for Mustansir
and proved to be a first rate missionary for the Obeidi government.
When he parted with Mustansir as a missionary, he said to him.
"Whom should I follow after you? Who will be my Imam?"
Mustansir said, "My son Nazar will be your Imam after me. " That is
why the group founded by Hasan bin Sabah is also called Nazaria .
After his return from Egypt, he lived for sometime in various cities
of Iraq and Iran and began to convert the people to his beliefs. Due
to the efforts of the Ismaili missionaries, many of the Shias and nonShias had already embraced the Ismaili faith . So, Hasan bin Sabah
was able to gather many supporters very quickly . Mahdi Alawi was
the governor of the province of Isfahan and Qahistan on behalf of
Malik Shah. Hasan bin Sabah fraudulently purchased the Qalaa alMaut (Fort of Death) from Mahdi Alawi in order to construct his
prayer house. He fortified it in all respects. He collected his devotees
endeared himself to the illiterate and warring tribes of the
neighboring regions, founded his kingdom and came to be known as
Sheikhul Jabal. He invented some strange faiths and practices and

632

The History of Islam

inculcated them into the people's minds. He pre pared a group of
dedicated fighters who wrought wonders. He remained in his Maut
Fort and had great Kings, ministers and scholars murdered by his
fighters . He made his famous missionary Kaiyya Buzarg Ummee d
his heir-apparent and successor whose descendents continued lo
rule for several generations. Finally, Hulegu Khan exterminated this
group in 655 A.H. The government founded by Hasan bin Sabah
lasted in Qahistan for about 175 years from 483 A.H. to 655 A.H.
This Ismaili government had established its superiority all over the
world and great emperors feared these warrior assassins for they
always attacked their adversaries suddenly and by dece it and when
they found thei r victim alone.

The Crusades against Syria
The European Christians began attacking the Muslims in 490 A.H. The
Christian missionaries had enthused and instigated their people
against the European Muslims and called for the liberation of Syria
from Muslim occupation. They regarded this as an act of great
religions service and a source of salvation. The chain of these attacks
continued for over 300 years. All the Christian kings of Europe geared
up to march to Syria along with the Christian invaders and to use their
united power. All these invasions form an interesting chapter of the
history of Islam and they will be narrated together. The part of these
crusades dealing with Sultan Salahuddin Ayyubi's confrontations
with the Christians is extremely important and interesting.

The Mongol Kingdom of Asia
In the beginning of the seventh century A.H., the Mongols or Tartars
from the northern mountains of China and under Genghis Khan's
command moved towards the west and made the countries of
Turkistan, Mawaraunnahr, Khorasan, Azerbaijan, Isfahan, Afghanistan,
Iran, Iraq, Syria, Asia Minor, Russia and Austria the target of their
looting, killing and plundering. They ruined hundreds of kingdoms
and put to death dynasties. In the middle of the seventh century in 656
A.H. Hulegu Khan looted Baghdad and killed its last Abbasid Caliph
Motasim Billah, which has already been mentioned. Following

A General Study of Unwwi and Abbasi Caliphates

633

Genghis Khan's death in 624 A.H., the Mongol empire was divided
into several parts. A part of Genghis Khan's descendents ruled over
China. It established its rule in Turkistan and Mawaraunnahr.
Another part established its Kingdom in Khorasan and Iran yet
another part came to rule over the area of the Caspian Sea. The
Mongol empire, which was established by Hulegu Khan in Iran and
Khorasan, deserves our special attention. [n a very short time, most of
the Mongol Empire turned into Islamic territories, that is, the Mongols
embraced Islam and became the servants of Islam. After 175 or 200
years, the Mongol Empire in Asia began to decline and ultimately it
became extinct. In its place were formed many small states in Iran,
Khorasan, Iraq and Mawaraunnahr.
In this state of decline of the Mongol powers in 800 A.H. a chief called
Timur (Tamerlane) appeared. By virtue of his victories, he created an
uproar all over the Asian continent and repeated the history of
Genghis Khan's conquests. Timur was a Muslim but he also used
killing and plundering as part of his warfare. They were far more
civilized and disciplined compared to Genghis Khan. Timur's
descendents succeeded in becoming rulers of all the same territories in
which Genghis Khan's descendents had ruled. And just as Genghis
Khan's descendents saw their downfall, similarly and with the same
rate Timur's descend en ts met their end. The Mongols of Timur ruled
for approximately the same period of time as the Mongols of Genghis
Khan. When Timur's dynasty ended i.n Iran and Turkistan a man
named Babar was born from among Timur' s descendents. He founded
a very powerful empire in India and Afghanistan, which lasted for a
significant period of time.

The Ottoman Empire of Turkey
A reference to the Oguz Turks has already been given above. The
Seljuks had pushed most of the tribes of the Oguz Turks back to the
provinces of Armenia and the coast of the Caspian Sea. Among them
was one, which has the credit of founding the Ottoman Empire. When
the Seljuk Sultan's rule was over and the Mongols began to create
havoc, there were 10 to 12 small states in that part of Asia Minor,

634

The History of Islam

which were under Muslim occupation. Seljuk princes or the Seljuk's
slaves governed those states. One of these states located near the
border of Armenia, was under the control of Sulaiman Khan, the chief
of a tribe of the Oguz Turks. When the Mongols invaded Alauddin
Kaiqbad Seljuk's state, Sulaiman and his son Artughril accompanied
by their native Turks helped Alauddin Kaiqbad . Their attack was
perfectly timed and that forced the Mongols to retreat and flee.
Alauddin Kaiqbad honored Sulaiman with a royal robe and made him
the commander in chief of his army and awarded a large feudal estate
to his son Artughril near the city of Ankara. Alauddin Kaiqbad's
capital was the city of Konya at the time. Artughril's feudal estate was
located at the border of the Roman emperor's territory. After his
father's death, Artughril extended the frontiers of his territory. He
secured some territory from the sultan of Konya as a reward and some
he took from the Christians. In this way, he came to establish a goodsized state. The
Mongols did not disturb these small rulers in Asia
~-.Minor and left them alone. In 641 A.H., gheyathuddin Kaikhusru the
Successor Alauddin Kaiqbad of had to pay tax to the Mongols. In 657
A.H., Artughril died and he was succeeded by his son Uthman
(Turkish Usman) at the age of thirty. The Sultan of Konya,
Gheyathuddin Kaikhusro, married his daughter to Usman and
appointed him the commander in chief of his army too. When
Gheyathuddin Kaikhusro was killed in 699 A.H., all the Seljuk Turks
put Usman on the throne of Konya and so besides his own state, the
territory of Konya came under his control also. He called himself
Sultan. This is the sultan after whose name the Ottoman Empire is
known. The Ottoman Sultans were soon able to capture Asia-Minor
and drive out the Romans. In 663 A.H., the Ottoman sultans
conquered Adrianople and made it their capital and established an
Islamic government in southeast Europe by capturing the province of
Trabzon. The Roman emperor made peace with him and this saved
the rest of his empire from the Ottoman powers. Then the Ottoman's
started giving the Christians one defeat after another and continued to
extend their frontiers. Finally, in 792 A.H., the Christian kings of
Austria, Bulgaria, Bosnia and Hungary jointly launched a very big
offensive against the Ottomans. Sultan Murad with a small army

'

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

635

confronted this huge Christian army at Kosovo and' gave them a
crushing defeat that shook and shocked the whole of Europe. In 799
A.H. the whole of Europe including the French and German armies
stood up to root out the Ottoman Empire. The confrontation with
Sultan Bayazid, Sultan Murad's son, took place at Nicopolis. Sultan
Bayazid, known as Bayazid Yaldram, scored an important victory
over the united European forces. Over 20 Christian rulers and
dignitaries were brought as captives to the court of Bayazid, who were
either kings or princes. This defeat sent a wave of fear all over
Christendom. The vanquished Christian kings went back to their
countries and made extensive publicity for the formation of a crusade.
Then these Christians with even more religious enthusiasm and fervor
collected and prepared to fight a decisive war with Bayazid Yaldram.
Bayazid Yaldram defeated them in this battle also and was thus able
to force the whole of Europe to obey him. At that time, the Roman
emperor was in terror. He did not lag behind in sending
reinforcements to the Christian crusaders secretly. So, Bayazid
Yaldram decided to punish the Roman emperor and finish Christian
rule from the Balkan Peninsula and then finish the Christians forever
by conquering the entire European continent. He was still thinking of
attacking when news came from the Asian continent that Timur with a
huge army had invaded Bayazid Yaldram's Asian territories. He was
forced to turn to Asia Minor and face Timur. In 814 A.H., the battle
took place at Ankara, which resulted in a victory for Timar and
Bayazid Yaldram's capture thus the European continent escaped
from being over run by the Muslims. It then appeared as if the
Ottoman Empire was going to end but after a few years, it was
restored to the power and glory seen during Bayazid Yaldram's
regime. Within 50 years, Muhammad II conquered Constantinople
and put an end to Christian rule in the Balkan Peninsula. Then
Sultan Salim gave a crushing defeat to the Iranians, conquered
Egypt, Iraq, and Arabia and established the Islamic calipf1ate in 922
A.H. by finishing the Abbasid caliphate and introduced the chain of
Islamic caliphate into the Ottoman dynasty as has been mentioned
above. The history of this dynasty is highly interesting as well as
instructive for the Muslims.

636

The History of Islam

The Turks of Kashghar
The Turk tribes inhabiting the eastern part of Farghana, which had
converted to Islam, established independent kingdoms that lasted
from 320 A.H. to 560 A.H. One of their rulers called Elak Khan ruled
in Turkistan. His capital city was Kashghar. He belonged to the Oguz
Turks and the Ottoman Turks were their countrymen. When the
Seljuk Turks established their kin gdom, these tribes went to Armenia
and Azerbaijan The Seljuk Turks also were originally from the same
nation. These wandering tribes established their kingdoms around the
Caspian Sea and those, which were pushed to the east, founded their
governments in Turkistan with their capital in Kashghar.

The Kings of India
The Indian state of Sindh was annexed to the Islamic caliphate in the
first century A.H. The Governors of Sindh continued to be appointed
by the Caliph's court many years. When the Abbasid caliphate bega n
to weaken there sprang up several independent Islamic states. Slowly
and gradually, the areas of those Islamic states began shrinking. One
of these states in Sindh existed until the invasion of Ma hmood
Ghaznavi. He attacked Punjab and Multan and annexed them to his
Islamic government. And when the Gha uris succeeded the Ghaznavis,
they conquered the whole of nort_hern India and establi shed a
powerful Islamic state. The first M,uslim king who came to the throne
of India was Qutbuddin Ebak who was a slave of Shababuddin
Ghauri . The Khilji dynasty followed the slave dynasty and then came
the Tughlaqs. The Tughlaq dynasty was followed by Khizr Khan's
dynasty. Then the Lodhis became the rulers followed by the Moghals.
But Sher Shah expelled them and founded his own Kingd om. The
Moghals recaptured India from the Sher Shah dynasty and established
their own empire. Then the English entered India. The Muslim
dynasty referred to above was es tablished in Delhi and Agra. Other
contemporary Muslim Kings ruled in different provinces of Indi a for
example the Bahmani dynasty, Kings of Gujrat, Kings of Jonepur, the
Kings of Bengal and the Kings of Malwa. The account of these with
details could be seen in hi story of India .

A General Study of Umawi and Abbasi Caliphates

637

The Sultanate of Jalairiah of Iraq
When the Mongol Empire collapsed, the Mongol chiefs established
their separate kingdoms in various places including the Jalair
dynasty, which ruled in Iraq from 736 A.H. to 814 A.H. Their capital
was Baghdad. The founder of this ruling dynasty was Sheikh Hasan
Buzurg Jalair. His son Owais succeeded him as the ruler in 757 A.H.
after his death. He took Azerbaijan and Tabriz from the Turkmen in
759 A.H. and included Mosul and Deyar Bakr into his Kingdom.
When he died in 784 A.H., Kurdistan was given to his son Bayazid
and Iraq and Azerbaijan went under the control of his next son
Sultan Ahmad Jalair. In 796 A.H., Timur conquered Jalair's entire
territory and Ahmad Jalair fled to Egypt. He lived there as a refugee
with the Mamluks for several years and when Timur returned to
Samarkand, Ahmad Jalair came back and recaptured his old
territory. In 813 A.H., Yusuf Turkmen killed Ahmad Jalair in the
battle. His nephew Shah Wald came to the throne of Baghdad . At
last, in 814 A.H ., this dynasty was completely destroyed by the Kara
Koylunlu Turkmen.

The Kingdom of Mozaffar

their power away from them. Kara Koylunlu means' black sheep'.
They had the picture of a black sheep on their flags so they were
called Kara Koylunlu. Similarly, Ak Koylunlu means a white sheep
and they had the picture of a white sheep on their flags and so they

Kazim but he was a Sunni by faith. Once when Timur expressed his
readiness to do anything for him in exchange for some service the
Sheikh asked him to release all the Turk captives. He obeyed and
released all of them. After freeing them, he took the oath for the
Sheikh and began to live with him. Timur left Ardbil but the Sheikh
found himself surrounded by a huge crowd of dedicated servants
who showed their loyalty to the Sheikh's descendents for
generation~ until they made one of his descendents Ismail Safwi
their King. Ismail Safwi was a Shia by faith. In 903 A.H., he
conquered a few cities in Iran and then in stages he succeeded in
bringing under his control the entire country . In 920 A.H., Sultan
Salim I gave him a shocking defeat at the battle of Chaldiran, a place
20 miles away from Tabriz. He annexed some western provinces of
the Safwi government and then turned to Syi:ia and Egypt. Ismail
Safwi Jived for 10 years more after this defeat and his descendents
continued to rule in Iran until Nadir Shah Irani exterminated this
dynasty in 1148 A.H. and established his own rule. Then Iran and
