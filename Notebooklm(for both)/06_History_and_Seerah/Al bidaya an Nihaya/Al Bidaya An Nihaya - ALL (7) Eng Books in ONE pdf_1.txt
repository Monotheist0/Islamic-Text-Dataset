Tile Plan of Action for Tllis Book:
1. Summari za ti on of the tex t. Thi s was achie ved by
conce ntrating on the mos t important evcnts narratcd in
the book. In doing so, we took care not to lea ve out any
important details which would ca use loss of mcan ing or
import.
2. We reli ed on a Ilumbcrofprintcd and handwrittcn copies of
the book and in cases where any contrad iction or omiss ion
was found, we succeeded in establi shin g the most accurate

3. We left out the a/wdeel" which proved 10 be base less or
weak and confin ed ourse lves to th e alladeelll whic h arc

to th e existcnce of othe r supportin g narration s. On rare
occasions, w hen it was found that there were no other
a/wdcelll in the c hap ter, wc included so me weak ahadeeth
whose weakness was not of an ex treme nature.
4. We perform ed takhreej (2) of the ahadeer" wi th ascripti on
of the number of the sec ti on and the page, th e number
of th e lIadeerh and in many cases, the prec ise location of
the Iwdeelll in the original source, th en the ruling on its

the alladeelli therein do not req uire any ruling on the ir

They also differed regarding th e ques ti on of whether or not
there existed any creation before th e fonna ti on of the heavens
and the Earth. Some groups among the rati onalist theologians
supported the idea that nOlhing existed before the m and that
they were created from abso lute nothingness. Ot hers said that
no. before the creation of th e heavens and the Earth the re were
other creations; and they based this clai m on the Wo rds of Allah,

So me said that the Pcn was created before a ll of these things
and this was the pre ferred view of Ibn Jaree r At-Tabari, Ibn

Ih e fwdeelh narrated by Imam Ahmad, Abu Oawood and A tTirmidhi , on the au thority of ' Ubada h Ibn As-Sa mit -to, who
sa id: The Messenger of A ll ah ~ said, "The first thing that

This was narra ted by Ibn Jareer and Ibn Abi Hatim and it was
the preferred view of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal in the book in whi ch
he refuted the argum ents of the Ja/lIl1iyyah. It was a lso the
pre ferred view o f Ibn ./a reer and a number of the later schola rs
- and A ll ah knows better. Later, we sha ll present evidence to
suppon thi s opi nion. Ibn Jareer narrated , on the authority of AdDahhak Ibn Muzahi m and others, that the names of the six days
are: "Abjad, I-Iall'lI'az. I-Iutli, Ka/ell/lIlI, Sa/as and Qarashl."
Ibn Jareer al so repon ed three sayings relati ng to the first days.
He narrated, on the auth ority of Muhammad Ibn Ishaq, that
he sa id, "Th e followe rs of th e Torah say that A ll ah began the
creat ion on Sunday, whil e the follow ers o f the Il1jeel say th at
Allah began th e creation on Satu rday, w hil e we Mus li ms,

say ing which is reported by Ibn Ishaq from the Muslim s was
fa vored by a number of Shqfi 'j sc holars of Islami c Juri sprudence
and others. It was re ported in a J/{Ideelll on the authority of Abu
Huraira h ~ th at th~ Messenge r of Al lah ~ said: "All ah crea led

A ll ah, Most Hi gh, says, ( He it is Who created fo r you all
that is on Eart h. Th en He is/ flJl'tl (rose over) toward the heave n
and made them seve n hea vens and He is the All-Knowing )
(Soorall AI-Haqarall 2:29)
He, Most High, says, ( Say (0 Muhammad): " Do yo u ve rily

known as Shattanawf. Then the westerly fl ow takes it through

it also divid es into two flo ws at Jawja r. The wes tern flow
passes th rough the western side of Dim yat and pours into the

where it pours into a lake east of Dimyat. Th is lake is known
as La ke Tinnccs or Lake Dimyat. The distance betwcen its
start ing point and its end po int is a vast one and this is why
it is such a calm river. Ibn Seena said , " It has characteri sti cs

measured fro m its source to its end- po int, it is the longest river.
in additi on, it flows through rocks and sand s, bu t it contain s no

What is mea nt is that He, Mos t High infonn s us about the
creation o f the hea vens and its grea t vastness and elevat ion, that
it is th e ultimate ill bea uty, splendor, perfec ti on and brill iance,
as I-Ie, Most High , says , ( By the heaven full of 11IIhuk (full of

so that you may guide your course with the ir help through the

whoever ass igns any other purpose to them, i.e. slleh as the

as ev idence and comparisons betwee n th eir orbits and cla ims
that this is proo f that cert ain Ea rthl y events will ta ke pl ace, is
mistaken. Thi s is beca use most o f what they saya n thi s subjec t

mentioned that He crea ted seven heavens one abo ve an other.
But scholars have differed as to wh ether or n OI th e spaces
between them are piled up togeth er or whether there arc spaces
between them. In facl, the latter is the correct opi nion.
In the Saheehain it is reported on the authorit y of Anas 4>
in the hadeerh of AI-/!'Ta' that he said: In the lowest heaven

When thi s is known , the n it (w ill be reali zed that) thi s is a
hadeeth which does not co ntradict wha t we have mentioned
rega rdin g the rota ti on of th e heavenl y bodies, accord ing to the
most well-known Iwo opi nions. There is not ev idcnce o f the
sph erical shape of the Throne, as some ha ve claimed. we have
al ready prove n the fa lse ness of their op inion. Nor does it prove
tha t it (the sun) asce nd s to a pl ace above the heave ns fro m our
direction until it prostrates be neath the Th ro ne. Rather, it sets
out of our sight and co ntinu es in it s coursc. There is nothing in
the revealcd Sc ripture to in va lidate it, rather tha t whi ch proves
it and requ ires it is in percept ion , like ec lipses. Thi s is because,
if it fo ll ows its course un til it reaches the midd le of il - so Ihat it
is the lime oflile middle o f the night, for exa mpl e - th en it wil l
be at it s fllrthesl point from the Th rone and likew ise, it will be at
its closest poi nt a t the time of settin g from ou r di rec tion .When
it is in the place of its prostra ti on, it seeks permi ss ion from the
Lord as it ri ses from the East and perm ission is granted to it and
it appears from th e direct ion of th e East.
And when it is th e time whi ch Allah wi ll s for its se ttin g from
the dirccti on o f" the West, it prostrates according to it s custom
and seeks permission to rise, according to its c ustom, but it will
not be permitted 10 do so and so it prostrates aga in, then asks
perm iss ion, but is denied, then it prostra tes a third time, but
it is denied and this goes on throughou t th e ni ght , as we have
sa id in th e Tafs·eel". Then it will say, "0 Lord! Th e dawn is ni gh
and th e distance is far. " Then it will be said to it, " Return frol11
whe nce you came." And so it wi ll ri se from th e West. Th en,
when the peopl e sec it, they wi ll all beli eve and that is (th e
mean ing of) the Words of Allah, Mos t Hi gh: ( Whe n no soul
which had not bel ieved previous ly or ea rned good though its

( It is not for the sun to ovcrtake the moon. nor does th e night
outstrip the day. They all fl oat, each in an orb it. ) (Sool'(ll1 Ya
Seen 36:40) That is. the sun cannot overtake th e moon and rise
in its domain ; ne ither can the 11100n overtake the su n and ri se in
its do mai n. Lik ewise, Ihe night cannot precede the day, Rather,
when the clay has gone, the nigh t comes after it, foll owing on

and the days to lengthen, until they are equa l - and that is
at the beg innin g of spring. Then the days begin to lengthen
and the nights get shorter, until they also become equa l at the
beginn in g of the autumll . Then the night s begin to lengthen
and the days to shorten , until the end of the autum n. Then the
days begin to lengthen slowly and the nights begin to shorten
slowly, until they become equal at the start of the sprin g, as
we said prev ious ly. That is what happens every year. This is
why All ah says, ( Hi s is the alternation of ni ght and day. Will
yo u not th en understand? ) (SoO/'all A/-Mu 'minOOI1 23 :80) That
is, the d isposal of all that is in Hi s Hands; the Judge, Who is
not contrad icted and is not opposed. And this is why He says
in three Verses, when speaking of the heavens, the stars, the
night and the day, ( Such is the meas uri ng of the Almigh ty, the
All -Know in g ) (Saara" AI-An '01/1 6:96) That is, the Almi ghty,
Who has subjugated all things and to Whom all things have
submitted and so He is not opposed and He cannot be overcome.
He is the Knower of a II things and He has appointed a measure
for everything, according to a nile which does not change and
cannot be disturbed.
So the bodies that are in the sky include tho se that constantly
move and they are known as lI1utahayyirah (1) by the scholars
of tasyeer; (2) and most of thi s knowledge is correct, unlike the
"science" of (astro logical) rulings, most of whi ch is false and
without any evidence to support its claims. These are seven
in number and they arc: the moon, which is in the lowest
heaven, 'Ularid (Mercury), which is in th e second, Az-Zllhrah
(\) MUlaha):.I'imh:Wandering stars; Ihey were known as such because they
seemed to stray irregularly across the sky. At times they arc seen moving

Suc h is the Decre(' o f Ilim the A lm ighty, th e A ll-Knowing
(Sooroll Pussi/a/ 4 1: 12). So Allah se lccted the lowest heaven

and if thi s proves lhat they (the plane ts) a re adornments, the n
so be it. If not, th en there is no objection to what the ot he rs

so that they may worship (prostrate before) Allah, Who brings

Because th e most cminent of the visible bodi es in the heavens

arc th e sun and th e moon, AI-Khalee l Ibrahecl11 .'fJl proved the
fu til ity of wo rsh ipping them; and that is in the Words of All ah,
Most Hi gh: ( When he saw thc moon risin g up, hc said, 'This

thc sun rising up, he sa id, 'Thi s is my lord. This is greater.'
But when it set, he said , '0, my people! I am indeed free from

The Prophet ~ said: "Why don ' t you draw yourse lves

Companions said , "Messenger of All ah, how do th e angels
draw themselves up in rows in the presence of their Lord'!"

one on the lert record s hi s bad deeds. When the ange l on the

to him, "G ive him a re spi te, that haply, he may repent or seek

what has bee n writte n re lating to this iss ue is recorded in the

The o ldest di scourse tha t I have seen relating to th is issue is
that mentioned by A I- Hafiz Ibn ' A sak ir in h is Tareekh, in the

Ibn ' Abdu l-Aziz and found wi th him a group of peopl e, ' Ulllar
sa id, "Th ere is no on e more noble in All ah's Sight than a nobl e
person from the children of Ada m," And he cited as evidence
for hi s claim th e Words of A llah , Most Hi gh: ( Ve ril y, those

Ibn Sa'eed agreed w ith him in thi s, but 'lrak Ib;, Mal ik said,
"There is none more noble in Al lah's Sight than His angels:
they perpetua ll y se rve Hi m and they arc His messengers to hi s
Prophets." He c ited as ev idence fbr his claim the Words ofA llah ,
Most High: ( " Yo ur Lord d id not fo rbid you thi s tfce save you
should becom e an ge ls Of become of th e imll1 orta ls," ) (Soomh
AI-A 'raJ 7:20) 'U mar Ibn 'Abdu l-Aziz said to Muhammad
Ibn Ka ' b A I-QlIrazi, " What do you say, Abu I-I amzah?" He
sa id , "A llah has honored Adam and created him wit h His Hand
and He breathed into him of His Spi rit and caused the angel s

they killed them, drove them ou t of it and exterm inated the m.
And they inhabited it afte r them, because of what they had

A I- Hasan A I-B asri said: " He was not of the an gel s for even

Ib lces was of th e j inn whom th e an ge ls ex pe lled and they
captured some o fth cm and took them to the heavell . Thi s was
narrated by Ibn Ja ree r A l-Tabari .
They said that w hen A llah w illed to create Adam ~ in orde r
that he mi ght be 0 11 th e Ea rth along with hi s progeny w ho ca me
after him and created his body from it, Ib lees - whose name at
that time was' Azazcc l and w ho was the leader of the jinn and
the most ferve nt of th em in worshipping Allah - went around
and in side his body and w hen he fo und that it was ho llow, he
realized that he was a creation w ho co ul d not be contro lled and
he sa id , " If I gain mastery over you, I will certa inl y destroy yo u,
but if you ga in mas tery o ver me, I w ill di sobey you." Th en,
wh en A llah blew into him o f Hi s Sp irit , as we shall see, and
commanded the ange ls to prostrate be fore him , Iblees beca me
fi lled with extreme envy and re fu sed to prostrate befo re him.
I-Ie said , " I am better than he; You created me from fire and
You crea ted him from clay." So he di sobeyed th e comm and
and opposed the Lo rd, the A lmighty, the A ll - Powerful and he
co mm itled a sin by hi s words and was w ithd rawn from th e
Me rcy of ll is Lord and removed from the hig h positi o n that he
had occ upi ed due to his worshi p. I-Ie had resembl ed the an gels
but he was no t o f the same spec ies as them , because he was
created from fire, whil e th ey were created from ligh t. He had
been d eceived by hi s nature and returned to hi s fi ery orig in:
( So the ange ls prostra ted themse lves, all ofthel11, except Iblees

down to the Earth wretched, humbled, di sgraced and expell ed,
with the threat (or promise) of the Fire for him and those of the
jinn and mankind who follow him. In spite o f thi s, he exerts
all of his efforts to mi sgui de the chil dren of Adam, by every
means and every way, as Allah , Most High, says, ( (Iblees)
sa id. 'See? Thi s one whom You have honored above me, if You
give me resp it e (keep me alive) to the Day of Resurrection, I

o f thi s great event before it too k place. The angels asked, with
the intenti on of acquiring kn ow lcdge and seek ing wisdom, not

As fo r the Words o f All ah, Most Hi gh, ( I know th at which

by Sa'eed Ibn Juba ir, Muj a hid, As-S udd i, Adh -Dhahhak a nd

( A nd (remember) when We said to the angel s: ' Prostrate

is a grea t honor bes towed by A llah on Adam ~ , when He
created him with Hi s l'land and breathed into him Hi s Spirit,

said, ' I am beller than he (Adam), You c reated me from fire.
ami him You created from clay' ." ) (SoOl'ol1 AI-A 'roJ7: 11 , 12)
A I-Ha san AI-Ba sr; said , " Iblccs lI sed qiya,\' (ana logy) and he
was the first one \0 do so." Thi s statemcnt has an auth cnti c
chain o f narra ti ons . Ibn Secree n sai d, "The first to usc qiyos
was Iblees, and th e sun and 11100n would not be worshipped if
not fo r qiyas." Both of these sta tements we re reported by Ibn
laree r At-Tabari.
The meaning of thi s is tha t he com pared him se lf wi th Adam
~ and considered that he was superior to Adam ~ , and thus
refused to prostrate him, in spite of th e fac t th at he and all
o f the angels had been commanded to do so. But analogy in
th e presence of evidence is invali d. In addition, it is in itself,
in valid, because mud is more beneficial than fire: mud has the
qualities of wisdom, forbearance, patience and assurance and
mud is whe re pla nts grow, flour ish, increase, and provide good.
To the contrary, fire has the qual ities of bumin g, recklessness
and hastiness,
In addit ion, All ah hon ored Adam ~ by c reating him with
Hi s I-land and breathi ng into him Hi s Spirit. Thi s is why He
cOlllmanded the angels to prostrate before him , as He says, (
And (re member) whcn your Lord sa id to the ange ls: ' I a m go ing
to create a man (Adam) from sounding clay of altered black
Sl1100th mud' :' ) - up to the Words of All ah, Most High: ( And
veri ly, the c urse shall be upon you ti\1 th e Day of Recom pense
(i,e, the Day of Resurrec ti on). ) (Soora" AI-Nijl" 15:28-35) He
deserved thi s from Allah, Most Hi gh, because he in sisted that
Adam ~ was inferior to him and beliltled him, wh ile claim ing
lh at he himself was superior to him, in sheer oppositi on to the

are you?" And she said , " I am a woman." He asked her, "Why
were you c reated?" She sa id, "So that you m ig ht live with me."
Th e ange ls said to him, in o rder to find o ut the extent of hi s

What is correct is that He repeat ed it in words, but in reality,
it only took place once and He linked to each mention a huklll

of pity toward hi s people, when he saw with his own eyes
th e punishment inflicted on them, for bei ng informed about
someth ing is no t th e same as see ing it with one's own eyes.
Thi s is why .He says, ("And construct the ship under Our

oflhose who did wrong; they are surely to be drowned. And as

Most Hi gh: ( (So it was) till then there came Our CO lllm and

they should no t be fo ll owed. And A llah knows better.
A number of ignorant peo ple from Persia and India ha ve
( I) Narrated by Imam Ahmad (8500). In its i.~lllId is one Abu Ja'far, who
has been condemned as "weak" by a number or scholars, while others
declared him to be tmstworthy. (In stich cases. it is the practice of the
scholars to act upon the negati vc report. since a scholar mi glll declare

another scholar might know somcthing (ncgati ve) about him which the

What Has Been Mentioned About the Character
ofNooh %fl\
A llah, Most Hi gh says, ( Verily, he wa s a grat eful slave. )
(Saarah AI-Ism' 17:3) It was said that he used to thank Allah
for hi s food , his drink and all of his affairs,
Imam Ahmad nalTated on the authority of Anas Ibn Ma lik ...;o
tha t he sa id: T he Messenge r of A ll ah ~ said, "Ve rily, All ah is
pl eased wi th the slave when he eats hi s food and thanks Him
for it and when he drinks hi s beverage and thanks I-lim for it"(I)
Mus lim, At-Tirll1idhi and A n-Nasa ' i narrated li kew ise from the
hadeelll of Abu Usamah
(2 )

'*'.

It is cl ear that a grateful person is the one who performs all
ac ts of obedience, including those of the hea rt, ve rbal ones and
physical ones, because gra lit ude is expressed by a ll of th em, as
the POCI says in AI-Bahr At-Tawee/:
.. YOll gellerolls people have bellefittedfrom three filings from me,
My hand, my tongue and hearl. "

As for hi s grave, Ibn Jareer and AI-Azraqi narrated on
the au thori ty of' Abdur-Ra hm an Ibn Sabit or another of the
Tab; '0011 in a IIIl1rsal (2) form, that Noah ~ was buried within
the precincts of the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah).
Th is is stronger and more re liable than what has been sa id by
many o f the later sc holars, who claimed that he is in a town, in
a place known today as Kark Noa h. In that place is a mosque
whi ch ha s bee n bu ilt because of these cla ims. And All ah kn ows

T he Arabs were known bc fore Isma' cel ~ as AI- 'A rab AI'Aribah and they consisted of nUl1l erolls tribes, including: ' Ad ,
T ha mood, Jurh ull1 . Tasl1l , Jadces, Ameem, Madyan, ImlaC] ,
Abi l, Jasim, Qahtall , Banu Yaql un and others.
As for th e Arabised Arabs, they were of the progeny of
Isma 'cc l, the son of Ibrahecm Af-Klmleel (peace be upon
them both), Isma ' cd , was the fi rst to speak c loquent , classica l
Arabi c and he leamed Ihe speech of the Arabs from thc tribe
of JurhU111, w ho ca mped near his mother, I-Iaj ar, in the Sacred
Preci ncts, as we sha ll make c lear in its placc , if A ll ah w ills,
But All ah made him abl e to speak w ith the utmost e loqucnce
and powcrs of e luc idation an d the Messen ger of A ll ah *5 was

Wha t is lllemH is that ' Ad - the first ' Ad - were the first to

" In a li ttle wh il e, they arc sure to be regretful." So As-Sailwll
(punishment - awful cry, etc.) overlook them with justice, and
We made them as rubbi sh of dead plants. So away with the
peopl e who arezalil11ool1 (pol yth eists, wrongdoers, disbelievers
in th e Oneness of A llah, di sobedi ent to His Messenge rs, etc.) )
(SoO/'oil AI-Mil 'lIIillOOIl 23:3 1-4 1).
He, Most High, says in Soorall Ha Meell1 As-Sajdah (Fllssilat) ,
( As for' Ad, they we re alTogan! in the land witho ut rig ht , and
they said, "W ho is mi ghtier than us in streng th?" See they not
that A ll ah , Who crea ted the m was mightier in strength than
they? And they used to deny Our Ayat! So We sent upon them
furi oll s w ind in days of evi l omen (for them) that We mi ght
give thcm a taste of di sg raci ng torme nt in this prese nt world ly
life, bu t sure ly the Puni shm ent of the Herea ft er wi ll be more
disgrac ing, and they will never bc helped. ) (SoO/·all Flissi/a!
41: 15, 16)
We wil l re late the purport o f th e story gathered from these
threads, along with what ca n be added to it from the trad itio ns.

We have al ready mentioned that they were the first of the nations
to wo rship idols after the Great Flood and this is clear from
His Words regarding them , ( And remember that I-Ie made YOll
sllccessors after the people ofNooh, a nd increased YOll amply
in stature." ) (Sooml! AI·A '1'0/7:69) That is, He made them the
strongest people in their time, in physique, power and bravery.
In Soorah AI-MIl 'milloon, He says, ( Thcn, af-icr thcm, We
created anot he r ge neration. ) (SoO/'oll A/-Ml! 'lI1inool1 23:3 1)
They were the people of Hood , acco rdin g to the correct view.
Others said lh at th ey were Thamood, based on the Words of
Allah , Most l-ligh , ( So As-Sai/wh (pun ish me nt - awful cry, etc.)
overtook them with justice, and We made them as rubb ish of
dead plants. ) (Soorah A'·MII 'l/1inooll 23 :41) They sa id, "They
are the people of Sale h ~ , for it is th ey who wcre destroyed by
As-Sai/wh. ( And as for ' Ad, they were destroyed by a fur iolls,
violent wind . ) (Soorah AI-Haqqah 69:6) Thi s sayi ng of theirs
does not rule out the possibility that they were overcome by a
combination of As-Saihah and the furious, violent wind, as we
shall show in the story of the people of Madyan, the Dwellers
of the 'Aykah (Wood). For a combinat ion of pun ishments were
inflicted on them, in addition to which, there is no dispute
regarding the fact that' Ad lived before Tham ood.
What is meant is that 'Ad were ali enated, disbelieving Arabs ,
who were arrogant and defiantly determined to worship idols
and so Allah sent to them a man frol11 among them, to call upon
them to beli eve in Allah , Most High , and to sincere ly devote
their worshi p to Him alone. But they belicd him , opposed him
and belittled him , as a result of which, Allah seized them with
the Seizing of the Almi ghty, (Who is) Most Able to carry out
what he Wills.
