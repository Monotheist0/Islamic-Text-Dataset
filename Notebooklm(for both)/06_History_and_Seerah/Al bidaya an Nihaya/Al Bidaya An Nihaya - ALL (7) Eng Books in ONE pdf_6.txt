Salaam and that of his aunt Khalidah as mentioned earlier on.
He also mentioned the acceptance of Islam of Mukhaireeq on
the Day of Uhud as shall be mentioned in due course; and that
he said to his people on the day of Sabbath: “O company of
Jews, by Allah, you are aware that the victory of Muhammad
over you will come to pass.” They responded: “Today is
Sabbath.” He said: “There is no Sabbath for you.” Then he
held his weapon and went out. He entered into an agreement
with his followers among his people saying: “If I am killed
today, my wealth should be turned over to Muhammad and he
may dispose it in a manner deemed fit by Allah.” He was a
man of considerable wealth. So he joined the battle alongside
the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon
him) and fought relentlessly until he was killed, Allah be
pleased with him. It has been related to me that the Messenger
used to say concerning him: “Mukhaireeq was the best of the
Jews.”
Then Ibn Ishaq mentioned those who inclined toward these
Jewish adversaries among the hypocrites of Aws and Khazraj.
From the Aws were Zuwayy Ibn Al-Harith and Julas Ibn
Suwaid Ibn as-Samit AlAnsari. The following verse was
revealed concerning him:
“They swear by Allah that they said nothing (bad), but really
they said the word of disbelief, and they disbelieved after
accepting Islam.” (At-Tawbah [9]:74) in response to his
293

statement when he lagged behind from the Battle of Tabook:
“If this man is truly (a Messenger) then we are in a worse
situation than donkeys.” His step son, Umair Ibn Sa’d
overheard and exposed him to the Messenger of Allah.
AlJulas disputed and swore that he never made such a
statement and that verse came down concerning him.
It is claimed that he repented so sincerely that he became well
known for his Islam and righteousness. His brother, Al-Harith
Ibn Suwaid was the one who killed Al-Mujadhdhar Ibn
Dhiyaad Al-Balawi and Qais Ibn Zaid from Banu Dubai‘ah
on the Day of the battle of Uhud. He marched forth alongside
the Muslims while he was a hypocrite. When the two armies
met, he attacked and killed the two Muslims then went over
to join the Quraish.
Ibn Hisham related that Al-Mujadhdhar had killed his father,
Suwaid Ibn Samit in one of the battles fought between them
during the period of Jahiliyyah so he avenged the death of his
father against him in the Battle of Uhud.
This how Ibn Hisham has related it meanwhile Ibn Ishaq had
mentioned that the killer of Suwaid Ibn Samit was Mu’adh
Ibn ‘Afraa’ who killed him outside the field of battle before
the occurrence the Battle of Bu‘ath. He shot and killed him
with an arrow. However, Ibn Hisham objects that Al-Harith
be blamed for the killing of Qais Ibn Zaid for, according to
him, Ibn Ishaq himself did not count him among the casualties
of the battle of Uhud.
Ibn Ishaq related: Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing of
Allah be upon him) had ordered Umar Ibn Al-Khattab to kill
him whenever he is captured. Al-Harith later sent a message
to his brother, Julas requesting him to seek penitence for him
so that he may return to his people. Then Allah revealed
concerning that, according to what was related to me from Ibn
'Abbas: “How shall Allah guide a people who disbelieved
294

after their belief and after they bore witness that the
Messenger (Muhammad) is true and after clear proofs had
come unto them? And Allah guides not the people who are
Zalimoon (polytheists and wrong-doers).” (Aal 'Imran [3]:86)
till the end of the story.
He added: Among them were Bijad Ibn Uthman Ibn Amir and
Nabtal Ibn Al-Harith who was the same person about whom
Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him)
said: “Whoever wishes to see Shaytan should have a look at
this (person).” He was a bulky man with extremely dark-red
skinned, rough haired with reddish eyes. He used to hear
words from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing of
Allah be upon him) and then he would relate it to the
hypocrites. He was the same person who said: “Verily,
Muhammad is all ears, he believes whatever anyone tells
him.” then Allah revealed:
“And among them are men who hurt the Prophet
(Muhammad) and say: “He is (lending his) ear (to every
news).” (At-Tawbah [9]:61)
He added: Among them were Abu Habeebah Ibn Al-Az’ar
who was among those who built the Masjid Ad-Dirar as well
as Tha’labah Ibn Hatib and Mu’attib Ibn Qushair both of
whom were the duo who gave a pledge to Allah that: “If He
bestowed on us of His Bounty, we will verily, give Sadaqah
(Zakah and voluntary charity in Allah’s Cause) (At-Tawbah
[9]:75) and then they reneged on their pledge and that verse
was revealed concerning them. Mu’attib was the same person
who said on the day of the battle of Uhud: “If we had anything
to do with the affair, none of us would have been killed here.”
Then Allah revealed the verse concerning it: “Even if you had
remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed
would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death,”
He was the same person who said on the Day of Ahzab:
“Muhammad is promising that we will obtain the treasure of
295

Kisra and Qaisar while each one of us do not even feel safe
going to the toilet.” Then Allah revealed concerning him:
“And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a
disease (of doubts) said: “Allah and His Messenger promised
us nothing but delusions!” (Al-Ahzab [33]:12)
Ibn Ishaq added: Among the Khazraj were Rafi’ Ibn
Wadee’ah, Zaid Ibn Amr, Amr Ibn Qais, Qais Ibn Amr Ibn
Sahl, Al-Jadd Ibn Qais who was the same person who said:
“Grant me leave (to be exempted from Jihad) and put me not
into trial.” (At-Tawbah [9]:49), Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn
Salool who was the same person who said: “If we return to
Al-Madinah, indeed the more honorable (‘Abdullah Ibn
Ubayy Ibn Salool, the chief of hypocrites at Al-Madinah) will
expel there from the meaner (i.e. Allah’s Messenger).” (AlMunaafiqoon [63]:8). Considerable number of verses of the
Qur’an had been revealed concerning him. It was concerning
him and the trustee of the man from Banu 'Awf as well as
concerning Malik Ibn Abi Qawqal, Suwaid and Da’is among
his cohorts that Allah revealed: “Surely, if they (the Jews) are
expelled, never will they (hypocrites) go out with them.” (AlHashr [59]:12) when they inclined secretly toward Banu anNadeer.

Those Who Accepted Islam Among the Jews
Out of Dissimulation
Then Ibn Ishaq mentioned those who accepted Islam among
the Jewish rabbis out of dissimulation while they were still
upon their disbelief internally. A group of the vilest
hypocrites followed them. They were Sa’d Ibn Hunaif, Zaid
Ibn Al-Lusait who was the same person who said when the
camel of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah
be upon him) got lost: “Muhammad claims that he receives
news from the heavens meanwhile he does not know where
his camel is?!” Then Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing
296

of Allah be upon him) said: “By Allah, I know nothing except
what I am taught by Allah and He has guided me to where it
(the camel) is. It is currently at this mountain pass detained by
a tree which hooked its rein.” Some men among the Muslims
went toward the direction indicated by the Prophet (peace and
blessing of Allah be upon him) and found it as he has said.
He added: These hypocrites used to attend the mosque, listen
to the discussions of the Muslims and they would gibe and
make jest of their religion. One day, a group of people
gathered in the mosque and the Messenger of Allah (peace
and blessing of Allah be upon him) saw them discussing in
hushed tones while they were closely clinged to one another.
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon
him) called them and then turned them out of the mosque
roughly.

The first military expedition was the
expedition of Al-Abwa’ Also Referred to as
the Battle of Waddan
Al-Bukhari related in the Book of Military Expedition that Ibn
Ishaq said: The first battle ever fought by the Messenger of
Allah was that of Al-Abwa’, then Buwat and then AlUshairah. It has also been narrated from Zaid Ibn Arqam that
he was asked, “How many Ghazawat did the Prophet
undertake?” Zaid replied, “Nineteen.” They said, “In how
many Ghazawat did you join him?” He replied, “Seventeen.”
I asked, “Which of these was the first?” He replied, “AlUsairah or Al-Ushairah.”
It is also recorded in Saheeh Al-Bukhari from Buraidah who
said: He participated in sixteen Ghazawat alongside Allah’s
Messenger (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him). Imam
Muslim also related that he participated in sixteen battles.
And in another narration it added that he participated in
nineteen battles and fought directly in eighteen of them.
297

Hanbal Ibn Ishaq related that Az-Zuhri said that the first Verse
to be revealed concerning fighting was:
“Permission to fight is given to those (i.e. believers against
disbelievers), who are fighting them, (and) because they
(believers) have been wronged.” (Al-Hajj [22]:39) this was
after the arrival of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing
of Allah be upon him) in Madinah. The first one of the battles
which he personally witnessed was that of Badr which
occurred on Jumu’ah of the 17th day of the month of
Ramadan.
He also added that he (Allah’s Messenger [peace and blessing
of Allah be upon him]) fought the battle of Uhud in Shawwal
i.e. in the third year and then he fought the battle of Khandaq
also in Shawwal of the fourth year (of Hijrah). He fought
Banu Lihyan in Sha’ban the fifth year and then he fought in
the battle of Khaybar in the sixth year and then the conquest
(of Makkah) occurred in Sha’ban of the eight year. The Battle
of Hunain occurred in the month of Ramadan of the same
year. The Prophet fought the 11th battle but did not personally
fight in it.
The first battle fought by the Messenger of Allah (peace and
blessing of Allah be upon him) was that of Al-Abwa’, then
Al-‘Ushairah, then the battle of Ghatafan followed by the
Battle of Banu Sulaim, then Ghazwah of Al-Abwa’ followed
by the first Badr, then the battle of At-Ta’if. Thereafter he
fought the battle of Hudaibiyah and then that of As-Safra’
followed by Tabook which was the last battle (he fought).
Then he mentioned military detachments that were sent out.
This is how I have written it from the (book of) history of AlHafiz Ibn Asakir and it is extremely odd. The correct version
is what we shall mention in their order shortly by the
permission of Allah. This branch (of knowledge) is from
those that is incumbent to be concerned with, to be revered
298

and to be prepared to acquire as narrated by Muhammad Ibn
Umar Al-Waqidi from Abdullah Ibn Umar Ibn Ali from his
Father that he heard Ali Ibn Al-Husain saying: “We used to
teach about the battles of the Prophet just as we used to teach
the chapters of the Qur’an.”
Muhammad Ibn Ishaq, Allah have mercy on him, said in AlMaghazi: Thereafter, Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing
of Allah be upon him) girded his loins concerning what Allah
has commanded him of Jihad against His enemies. From
Allah’s command was the fighting against who were close
among the polytheists.
Then Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing of Allah be upon
him) marched forth to fight in the month of Safar exactly
twelve months after his arrival at Madinah. Ibn Hisham
added: And he appointed Sa’d Ibn Ubadah over Madinah in
his stead.
Ibn Ishaq continued: The Prophet (peace and blessing of Allah
be upon him) marched forth till he reached Waddan which is
also known as the Battle of Al-Abwa’. Ibn Jareer said: “It is
also known as the Battle of Waddan.” With the intention of
fighting the Quraish and Banu Damrah Ibn Bakr Ibn Abd
Manat Ibn Kinanah but they made peace agreement with him
and the one who made that peace pact amongst them was
Makhshi Ibn Amr Ad-Damri and he was their chief at the
time. The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be
upon him) returned to Madinah and no fighting ensued. He
remained in Madinah for the remainder of the month of Safar
and the beginning of Rabee’ ul-Awwal. Ibn Hisham added:
And that was the first battle ever fought by the Messenger of
Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him).
Ibn Ishaq related: In his stead, Allah’s Messenger (peace and
blessing of Allah be upon him) appointed Ubaidah Ibn AlHarith Ibn Abdul-Muttalib Ibn Abd Manaf Ibn Qusayy to lead
299

other sixty or eighty horsemen from the emigrants. There was
no single Ansari among them. He marched forth until he
reached the water of Hijaaz at the lower part of Thaniyyat AlMarah. They confronted a great multitude of the Quraish but
no serious fighting took place between them except that Sa’d
Ibn Abi Waqqas was hit by an arrow that day. He was the first
to be shot an arrow in the part of Allah in Al-Islam.
Ibn Ishaaq related: The Messenger of Allah (peace and
blessing of Allah be upon him) also appointed Hamzah Ibn
Abdul-Muttalib Ibn Hashim to in his stead to lead a military
contingent comprising of thirty horsemen only from the
emigrants and none of them was an Ansari to the seashore in
the direction of AlAees. He met Abu Jahl Ibn Hisham at that
sea coast ahead of three hundred riders from the people of
Makkah. Majdi Ibn Amr Al-Juhani restrained and made peace
between both parties and they went their different ways
without a fight.
Ibn Ishaq also related: Some people say that the standard of
Hamzah was the first war standard affixed by the Messenger
of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) for anyone
among the Muslims and that his dispatch and that of Ubaidah
occurred simultaneously and so it became seeming to the
people (that Ubaidah was the first)

The Ghazwah of Buwat Toward Radwa
Ibn Ishaq related: Thereafter, Allah’s Messenger (peace and
blessing of Allah be upon him) marched forth in the month of
Rabee‘ ul-Awwal i.e. in the second year (of Hijrah) seeking
the Quraish. Ibn Hisham added: He appointed over Madinah,
as-Sa’ib Ibn Uthman Ibn Maz’oon.
Ibn Ishaq continued: (He advanced) till he reached Buwat in
the direction of Radwa and then he returned to Madinah and
he did not fight. He remained at Madinah for the remainder of
300

the month of Rabee‘ ulAkhir and some part of Jumada (AlOoula). Then he raided the Quraish i.e. in that raid referred to
as the raid of Al-Ushairah.
Ibn Hisham added: And he appointed Abu Salamah Ibn
Abdul-Asad to deputies for him over Madinah. Al-Bukhari
related that Ibn Ishaq said: Once, while I was sitting beside
Zaid Ibn Al-Arqam, he was asked, “How many Ghazawat did
the Prophet undertake?” Zaid replied, “Nineteen.” They said,
“In how many Ghazawat did you join him?” He replied,
“Seventeen.” I asked, “Which of these was the first?” He
replied, “Al-’Ushair or Al-Usaira.” This Hadith clearly
indicates that the first Ghazwah was that of AlUshairah.
Muhammad Ibn Ishaq related: On that day, Allah’s Messenger
(peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said to Ali “O Abu
Turab,” owing to the sand that was on him and we informed
him what had occurred of our affairs. So he said: “Shouldn’t
I inform you of the two most wretched of men?” We said,
“Yes, O Messenger of Allah.” He said: “the man of Thamood
who killed the camel and the one who would strike you over
here (i.e. on his forehead) until you are wet with your blood
till,” placing his hand on his beard.” This version of the
Hadith is strange and has a corroboration from another
version concerning the nick naming of Ali ‘Abu Turab’ as
contained in as-Saheeh Al-Bukhari that Ali once got angry
with (his wife) Fatimah, and went out (of his house) and slept
in the mosque. The Prophet came to their house and asked her
of his whereabout and she said: “He went out angrily.” The
Prophet came to the mosque and stirred him up while
removing the dust from his back, saying, “Get up, O Abu
Turab!” The First Battle of Badr
Ibn Ishaq related: Thereafter, upon his return from the battle
of Al-Ushairah, Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing of
Allah be upon him) did not remain in Madinah except a few
nights less than ten before he raided Kurz Ibn Jabir Al-Fihri
301

over the pastures of Madinah. The Messenger of Allah (peace
and blessing of Allah be upon him) marched forth to seek him
until he reached a valley called ‘Safwan’ in the direction of
Badr. That was the first battle of Badr. Kuraz escaped and thus
he could not catch up with him.
Al-Waqidi said: His standard (on that day) was borne by Ali
Ibn Abi Talib.

Detachment of Abdullah Ibn Jahsh Which
Was Incidental to the Great Battle of Badr
Ibn Ishaq related: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing
of Allah be upon him) dispatched Abdullah Ibn Jahsh Ibn
Ri’ab Al-Asadi in the month of Rajab after returning from the
botched first Badr along with a group of eight men from the
emigrants and there was not a single Ansari amongst them.
The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon
him) wrote a document for him and ordered him not to open
it until they had travelled for two days and then they may read
the document and then carry out whatever command
contained therein. He was also forbidden to coerce anyone
among his companions. When they had travelled for two days,
they opened the document and they found written therein:
“After you have read my document, proceed until you
descend into the palm tree plantation located between
Makkah and Ta’if. From here, you will surveil the Quraish
and ferret for us information regarding their movements.”
After he had read the document, he responded ‘I have heard
and I have obeyed.” He informed his companions of the
content of the document and said: “I have been forbidden to
coerce anyone of you. So whoever of you desires martyrdom
then let him advance and whoever objects to it, let him
return.”
Then a caravan of the Quraish passed by them carrying raisin
and butter and some of their merchandise. In the caravan was
302

Amr Ibn Al-Hadrami. The people debated on whether to
attack the caravan instead and soon after they decided upon
attacking the caravan. They embolden themselves against
them and fell upon whoever they were able to overpower and
then dispossessed them of their belongings.
When they returned to Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing
of Allah be upon him) in Madinah he blamed them saying: “I
did not send you to fight in the sacred month.” Their brethren
from among the believers equally upraided them over what
they had done. The Quraish began to spread words around that
Muhammad and his companions have violated the sacred
month.
When the people became persistent upon that, Allah revealed:
“They ask you concerning fighting in the
Sacred Months (i.e. 1st, 7th, 11th and 12th months of the
Islamic calendar). Say, 'Fighting therein is a great
(transgression) but a greater (transgression) with Allah is to
prevent mankind from following the Way of Allah, to
disbelieve in Him, to prevent access to Al-Masjid-Al-Haram
(at Makkah), and to drive out its inhabitants, and Al-Fitnah is
worse than killing. And they will never cease fighting you
until they turn you back from your religion (Islamic
Monotheism) if they can.” (Al-Baqarah [2]:217)
i.e. if you had fought in the sacred month, they had also
prevented you from the path of Allah coupled with their
disbelief. They had also prevented you from the sacred
mosque and had expelled you from there even though you
were its inhabitants. All of these are more grievous in the sight
of Allah than your killing of those whom you had killed from
their rank. Moreover, Al-Fitnah is worse than killing i.e. they
had put the Muslim to trial (Fitnah) concerning his faith until
they forced him to recant and return to disbelief after his
belief. That is far more grievous in the sight of Allah than
303

killing. They have perpetrated something worse and more
heinous than that without remorse or restrain.
This is why Allah says: “And they will never cease fighting
you until they turn you back from your religion (Islamic
Monotheism) if they can.” (Al-Baqarah [2]:217)
Ibn Ishaq said: When the feeling of disappointment felt by
Abdullah Ibn Jahsh and his companions had eased owing to
the revelation of the verse, they aspired for reward. They said:
O Messenger of Allah, do we have a hope that our expedition
is that of Jihad for which we will obtain the reward of
mujahidin?” Then Allah revealed: “Verily, those who have
believed, and those who have emigrated (for Allah’s
Religion) and have striven hard in the Way of Allah, all these
hope for Allah’s Mercy. And Allah is OftForgiving, MostMerciful.” (Al-Baqarah [2]:218) Thus Allah described them
with a hope greater than their expectation.
Ibn Ishaq said: Abu Bakr As-Siddiq rendered a poem
concerning the expedition of Abdullah Ibn Jahsh in response
to what the polytheists were saying regarding the desecration
of the sacred month. Ibn Hisham, however, said that it was
Abdullah Ibn Jahsh himself who rendered it: (excerpt from a
long poem)
You consider our killing in the sacred month as something
heinous
Meanwhile it is far more heinous in the perception of the
guided conscious mind
Your alienation from what Muhammad is saying
And your disbelief in him, Allah Sees and Witnesses
Your expulsion (of the Believers) from the mosque of Allah
304

So that they may not be seen in the Mosque prostrating to
Allah

The Changing of the Qiblah in the Second
Year of Hijrah Prior to the Battle of Badr
Some of them have said: that occurred in the month of Rajab
second year of Hijrah. This is the opinion of Qatadah, Zaid
Ibn Aslam and an opinion related from Muhammad Ibn
Is’haaq. Imam Ahmad has also reported something to that
effect from Ibn Abbas. It is also the apparent import of the
Hadith of Al-Bara’ Ibn 'Azib as shall be mentioned shortly.
However some others believe it occurred in the month of
Sha’ban of the same year.
Al-Bukhari related from Al-Bara’ Ibn 'Azib that: The Prophet
performed prayer facing Bait-Al-Maqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for
sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that his Qiblah
would be the Ka’bahh (at Makkah). (So Allah Revealed [AlBaqarah [2]:144] and he offered Asr prayers (in his Mosque
facing Ka’bahh at Makkah) and some people prayed with
him. A man from among those who had prayed with him went
out and passed by some people offering prayer in another
mosque and they were in the state of bowing. He said, “I,
(swearing by Allah,) testify that I have prayed with the
Prophet facing Makkah.” Hearing that, they turned their faces
to the Ka’bah while they were still bowing. Some men had
died before the Qiblah was changed toward the Ka’bah. They
had been killed and we did not know what to say about them
(i.e. whether their prayers toward Jerusalem were accepted or
not). So Allah revealed: “And Allah would never make your
faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered toward
Jerusalem). Truly, Allah is full of kindness, the Most Merciful
toward mankind." (Al-Baqarah [2]:143)
The summary of the whole affairs is that Allah’s Messenger
(peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) used to pray in
305

Makkah toward Jerusalem while the Ka’bah was right there
in his presence as related by Imam Ahmad from Ibn Abbas,
Allah be pleased with him. When he migrated to Madinah, it
was impossible for him to combined the two so he prayed
while facing Jerusalem and backing the Ka’bah at the outset
of his arrival at Madinah. This continued for sixteen or
seventeen months with the effect that it continued till Rajab
of the second year. And Allah knows best. All the while, the
Prophet had wished that the Qiblah would be changed to the
Ka’bah which was the Qiblah of Ibrahim. He used to call
profusely, humble himself and supplicate to Allah. He would
also raise his hands and his glance to the sky in earnest request
for that. Then Allah revealed:
“Verily! We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad’s)
face toward the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah
(prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in
the direction of Al-Masjid- Al-Haram (at Makkah).” (AlBaqarah [2]:144)
When the command to change the Qiblah was revealed, the
Messenger of Allah (peace and blessing of Allah be upon
him) addressed the Muslims and taught them the new
command as related by An-Nasa’i from Abu Sa’eed Ibn AlMu’alla and that occurred at the time of Zuhr. Some people,
however, said that the command for the redirection of the
Qiblah occurred in between the two Salats. This is the view
of Mujahid and other than him and the proof for that is what
is recorded in the two saheehs from Al-Bara’ that the first
prayer that Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing of Allah
be upon him) offered in Madinah while facing the Ka’bah was
the Asr prayer.
Strangely, that information did not reach the people of Quba
until the time of Subh prayer the next day when someone
came to them and said: “The Qur’an has been revealed to
Allah’s Messenger and he has been commanded to face the
306

Ka’bah, so turn toward it. Prior to that time, they were facing
Shaam so they turned (while still in prayer) to face Ka’bah.”
The import of this is that when the command for the
redirection of the Qiblah toward Ka’bah was revealed, that
constitutes an abrogation of praying toward Jerusalem.
Slanderous, foolish, ignorant and dim-witted fellows taunted:
“What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah [prayer
direction (toward Jerusalem)] to which they were used to face
in prayer.” (AlBaqarah [2]:142)
This and the disbelievers of the People of the Book knew
that it is from Allah owing to what they had found in their
Books concerning the description of Muhammad and
concerning the fact Madinah would eventually be the place
of his migration and that he would be commanded to face
the Ka’bah as Allah says:
“Certainly, the people who were given the Scriptures (i.e.
Jews and the Christians) know well that, that
(your turning toward the direction of the Ka’bah at Makkah in
prayers) is the truth from their Lord.” (AlBaqarah [2]:144)
Along with this, Allah also responded to all their questions
and obduracies. Allah says: “The fools (pagans, hypocrites,
and Jews) among the people will say, “What has turned them
(Muslims) from their Qiblah [prayer direction (toward
Jerusalem)] to which they were used to face in prayer.” Say,
(O Muhammad) “to Allah belong both, East and the West. He
guides whom He wills to a Straight Way.” (Al-Baqarah
[2]:142) i.e. He is the Sovereign, the Director, the Judge
Whose judgment cannot be interdicted. He legislates
whatever He wishes in His Shari’ah. He guides whom He
wills to a Straight Way and leads astray whomever He wills
away from the Correct Path and in doing that He has Wisdom
with which we must be pleased and to which we must submit.
307

Then Allah says: “Thus We have made you [true Muslims real believers of Islamic Monotheism, true followers of
Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah (legal ways)], a Wasat
(just) nation.” (Al-Baqarah [2]:143) i.e. the best of nations.
“…that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger
(Muhammad) be a witness over you.” (Al-Baqarah [2]:143)
i.e. just as We have chosen for you the best of direction for
your Salat and guided you to the Qiblah of your father
Ibrahim, the father of all the Prophets; to which Moosa and
those who came before him among the Messengers used to
face in their prayers. Thus have We made you the best of
nations and quintessence of the worlds, the most noble group
of both the ancient and recent times so that you may be
witnesses over mankind on the Day of Judgment owing to
their unanimity on your preference and their reference to you
with superiority as established in saheeh AlBukhari from the
Hadith of Abu Sa’eed in a marfoo’ form regarding Nooh’s
choice of this Ummah as his witness on the day of Judgment.
If Nooh has chosen them inspite of his time preceding theirs,
then how much more those who came after him.
Thereafter, Allah clarifies His Wisdom while informing of the
advent of His indignation and wrath for the one who doubts
and is hesitant concerning this incident and the advent of His
munificence for those who believes and follows this being.
Allah says: “And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction
toward Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those
who followed the Messenger (Muhammad).” (AlBaqarah
[2]:143)
Ibn Abbas explains: i.e. so that We may distinguish between
those who would follow the Messenger of Allah “…from
those who would turn on their heels (i.e. disobey the
Messenger). Indeed it was great (heavy)…” (Al-Baqarah
[2]:143) i.e. even though the implication of this incident is
great and hard “except for those whom Allah guided.” (AlBaqarah [2]:143) i.e. those who believe in it, accepts its reality
308

without entertaining doubt but are pleased and submit to it.
They believe and act for there are true worshippers of the
Great Law-Giver, the Able and Omnipotent, the All-Aware,
the Most Kind and Courteous and the All-Knowing.
Allah says: “Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to
be lost (i.e. your prayers offered toward Jerusalem).” i.e. the
legislation of praying toward Jerusalem. “Truly, Allah is full
of kindness, the Most Merciful toward mankind.” Ahadeeth
and narrations concerning this are quite copious indeed more
than could be enumerated (here). However, they have been
extensively discussed in the Tafseer. Nevertheless, further
explanation shall be provided in our book Al-Ahkam AlKabeer.
Imam Ahmad has related that 'A’ishah narrated that Allah’s
Messenger (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) said
concerning the People of the Book: “They are not envious of
us over anything as much as they are envy us over Friday to
which Allah guided us and which they missed. They are
envious of us over the direction of prayer which they missed
and our saying “Ameen,” behind the Imam.”

The Obligation of Fast of Ramadan in the
Second Year Prior to the Battle of Badr
Allah says: “O you who believe! Observing As-Saum (the
fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those
before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqun (the pious see V.2:2). [Observing Saum (fasts)] for a fixed number of
days, but if any of you is ill or on a journey, the same number
(should be made up) from other days. And as for those who
can fast with difficulty, (e.g. an old man, etc.), they have (a
choice either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for
every day). But whoever does good of his own accord, it is
better for him. And that you fast, it is better for you if only
you know. The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the
309

Qur’an, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the
guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So
whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the
month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must
observe Saum (fasts) that month, and whoever is ill or on a
journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe
Saum (fasts) must be made up] from other days. (Al-Baqarah
[2]:183-185)
Imam Ahmad related that Mu’adh Ibn Jabal said: The prayer
was transmuted in three situations and the fasting was also
transmuted in three situations. Then he mentioned the
situations of prayer. Then he said: “As for the situations of
fasting, when Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing of Allah
be upon him) arrived at Madinah, he used to fast three days in
every month. Then he fasted Ashoora’. Thereafter Allah made
fasting obligatory upon him when He revealed: “O you who
believe! Observing As-Saum (the fasting) is prescribed for
you as it was prescribed for those before you.” (Al-Baqarah
[2]:183) up to His statement: “And as for those who can fast
with difficulty, (e.g. an old man, etc.), they have (a choice
either to fast or) to feed a Miskin (poor person) (for every
day).” (Al-Baqarah [2]:184) It used be that whoever wished
fasted and whoever wished fed the poor and Allah permitted
that for them. Then Allah revealed the other verse: “The
month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur’an,” (AlBaqarah [2]:185) up to His statement: “So whoever of you
sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of
Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Saum
(fasts) that month.” (Al-Baqarah [2]:185) Thus the fasting of
that month becomes obligatory upon the resident and the
healthy and concession was provided for the ill and the one
on a journey. Feeding in lieu of fasting was established for the
elderly who is unable to fast. These are the two situations.
He added: They were permitted to eat, drink and have sexual
relation with their wives as long as they did not sleep. But if
310

they slept, then they were to refrain. A man from the Ansar
called Sirmah used work while fasting till nightfall. One day,
he came back to his wife, offered the Isha’ prayer and then he
slept without eating or drinking anything (to break the days’s
fats) until daybreak. So he began the day’s fast like that.
Thereafter Allah’s Messenger (peace and blessing of Allah be
upon him) saw him extremely exhausted and he asked: “Why
do you appear extremely exhausted?” Then the man informed
him of his situation. Added to that, Umar had had relationship
with his wife after he had slept so he came to mention the
incident to the Messenger of Allah and then Allah revealed
another verse:
“It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with
your wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts),”
(Al-Baqarah [2]:187) up to “..then complete your Saum
(fast) till the nightfall.” (Al-Baqarah [2]:187)

In The Defence Of the True Faith

Preface to the Revision
In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful
All praise and thanks be to Allah (SWT), Who revived knowledge of His
religion and caused it to blossom forth after it had all but disappeared, and
Who demolished the false conjectures of the apostates. I praise Him and I
seek refuge with Him from the sins which weigh upon the backs of
mankind. I worship Him and seek His aid in removing hindrances and
difficulties in the practice of my religion. I bear witness that none has the
right to be worshipped except Allah, Alone, without partners and I bear
witness that Muhammad – who, by Allah’s leave, brought about the dawn
of faith to the darkness and misguidance which existed in the hearts of
mankind – is the slave and Messenger of Allah. May the Blessings and
Peace of Allah be upon him in perpetuity.
O, Allah! We seek Your favor and through You we seek to ward off
affliction. We ask You to protect us and to grant us mercy. Our Lord!
Make not our hearts deviate after You have already guided us. Make it
easy for us to perform our deeds in the way that You have taught us. Make
us grateful for what You have given us and make plain a path for us which
leads to You. Open up the doors between us and You by which we may
arrive before You. To You belong the keys to the heavens and the Earth
and You are Most Able to do all things. To proceed:
Among the blessings which Allah has bestowed upon us, the community
of Muslims is that He has made it easy for us to follow the path of
guidance, and He has opened the doors of knowledge by making available
to us these new publications, which present to us the writings of the early
scholars and reveal to us what they said regarding legal verdicts, history,
events, information and lessons. These scholars opened a clear beacon of
light for all those Muslims seeking guidance and they set up for us a
signpost in which there is neither deviation nor crookedness. Whoever
follows it will arrive safely at his desired destination and whoever diverts
from it will be lost forever. They have written these books and treatises
and made clear to us therein events, information and virtues. Among such
10

In The Defence Of the True Faith
books is this unique work, Al-Bidayah Wan-Nihayah, by the Imam, the
Hafiz, the master scholar of hadeeth, ‘Imaduddeen Isma‘eel Ibn Katheer
Al-Qurashi – may Allah have mercy on him. This book was greeted with
approval by the vast majority of Muslims. No Islamic library would be
complete without it. In it, the author has recorded what Allah, Most High
has made easy for him about the history of mankind, from the beginning
of creation, starting with the creation of the Throne and the Kursi
(Footstool), the heavens and the Earth and all that they contain and all that
lies between them, such as the angels, the jinn and the devils. He also
described how Adam (Peace be upon him) was created, and told the stories
of the prophets up to the days of the Children of Isra’eel and the Days of
Ignorance (Jahiliyyah), until the advent of Prophet Muhammad (Peace
and Blessings of Allah be upon him), which heralded the end of
Prophethood. He then recorded his Seerah. Then he recorded the events
which took place up to his own time. He also spoke of the trials and
battles, the signs of the approach of the Hour, then the sending forth of
mankind and the terrors of the Resurrection, which he described in detail.
He then described the Hell-fire, with all its horrors, and Paradise and all
the good things contained therein. He called this particular volume of his
book: AnNihayah Fil-Fitan Wal-Malahim (The Ending in Trials and
Battles). As for the book which is in our hands today, it is Al-Bidayah.
By Allah’s Grace, I came to know brother Abdul Malik Mujahid, the
general manager of Darussalam Publishing in Riyadh. He visited me in
my humble office in Damascus and suggested to me the idea of creating
a summarized version of this wonderful book. I prayed for Allah’s
Guidance in the matter and sought help from Him in completing the
project. Allah enabled me to make the acquaintance of a number of people
of knowledge and experience in this field and a plan of action for the work
was written. It consisted of ten principal points and we then started the
task, seeking help from the Lord of the heavens and the Earth. All of us
exerted our utmost efforts in this task, making repeated revisions and
corrections, until we reached the point where, by Allah’s Permission, we
completed it and it was published in the form which is in your hands today.
The Plan of Action for This Book:

11

In The Defence Of the True Faith
1. Summarization of the text. This was achieved by concentrating on the
most important events narrated in the book. In doing so, we took care
not to leave out any important details which would cause loss of
meaning or import.
2. We relied on a number of printed and handwritten copies of the book
and in cases where any contradiction or omission was found, we
succeeded in establishing the most accurate and authentic text.
3. We left out the ahadeeth which proved to be baseless or weak and
confined ourselves to the ahadeeth which are authentic or hasan and
those which are acceptable due to the existence of other supporting
narrations. On rare occasions, when it was found that there were no
other ahadeeth in the chapter, we included some weak ahadeeth whose
weakness was not of an extreme nature.
4. We performed takhreej of the ahadeeth with ascription of the number
of the section and the page, the number of the hadeeth and in many
cases, the precise location of the hadeeth in the original source, then
the ruling on its authenticity, if it was not from the Saheehain, because
the ahadeeth therein do not require any ruling on their authenticity and
they have been widely accepted by the Muslim Ummah. As for the
ahadeeth in this book, we have relied on the opinions of the Imams
and scholars of hadeeth – including the earlier scholars, the later
scholars and those of the present day. On some occasions, we have
recorded the weak ahadeeth, while making it plain that they are not
authentic. We have not omitted them because the author has included
them in order to warn the people against them due to their widespread
popularity amongst the Muslims in general. In such cases, we desired
not to oppose the author in this effort and so we left them, at the same
time making the scholars’ ruling on them clear, so as to warn the
people against them.
5. We summarized the asaneed present in the book, in most cases
mentioning only the Companion who narrated the hadeeth, or the
person who reported it from him.

12

In The Defence Of the True Faith
6. We omitted many of the Isra’eeliyyat found in this book which the
author referred to in the preface, where he said: “We do not record the
Isra’eeliyyat except those which the Lawgiver has permitted, i.e.,
those which do not contradict the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of
His Messenger (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him). These are
stories which are neither believed nor belied and they have been
recorded because they provide details of unclarified narratives that we
have, or they provide names for people and places that have only been
mentioned in passing in our Revelation, due to there being no benefit
in specifying them for us. Thus we have reported them in order to
provide extra detail and not with the intention of citing them as
evidence or placing any reliance on them. Only the Book of Allah and
the authentic Sunnah of His Messenger (Peace and Blessings of Allah
be upon him) may be relied and depended upon. It is from Allah that
we seek help and it is He in Whom we place our trust; there is no help
and no power except in Allah, the All-Powerful, the Most Wise, the
Most High, the Almighty.
7. In some instances, we have referred back to the original manuscript in
order to verify the wording of a hadeeth from its source. In some cases,
the author has combined two narrations of the same hadeeth together
and so where this has occurred, we have noted it and separated the two
narrations, placing our own words between brackets, i.e., (and in
another narration…) and we have also identified the source of the
addition in the footnotes.
8. We have written the Qur’anic Verses in the Uthmani script, in
conformity with the copy of the Qur’an published by Al-Madinah AlMunawwarah Printing Complex.
9. We vowelised the words of many of the ahadeeth in the book and, in
addition, the poetic verses, wherever possible.
10. We mentioned the meters of the poetic verses between parentheses.
11. We explained the meanings of some difficult or obscure words,
relying on dictionaries, books containing ghareeb ahadeeth and
narrations and other sources.
13

In The Defence Of the True Faith
12. We furnished a brief biography of the author, Hafiz Ibn Katheer
though in reality, he requires no introduction and no description.
Finally, I ask Allah, Most High, to accept this humble work from us and
to acknowledge it as having been done purely and sincerely with the aim
of pleasing Him and to grant us and our brothers, who assisted us in the
production of this book, pardon and forgiveness in religious and secular
matters. In addition, we ask Him that He include this work in the weight
of our good deeds on the Day of Resurrection – a Day on which neither
wealth nor sons will benefit anyone – except for those whom Allah has
blessed with pure hearts.
And our final declaration is that all praise and thanks are due to Allah, and
we invoke blessings and peace upon Prophet Muhammad and upon all his
righteous family and Companions until the Day of Reckoning.
Yoosuf Al-Hajj Ahmad,
The humble slave of Allah.
Damascus, Ash-Snd of DhulHijjah, 1428 A.H.

Publisher’s Preface
Verily, all praise and thanks are due to Allah. We seek His aid and we ask
forgiveness of Him. We seek refuge with Allah from the wickedness in
ourselves. Whomsoever Allah guides, there is none who can misguide him
and whomsoever He sends astray, there is none who can guide him. I bear
witness that none is worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad
is His slave and His Messenger. He sent him with guidance and the true
Religion and with the light (of truth), the admonition and wisdom, at a
time when no Messengers were sent for a long period, when there was
little religious knowledge and the people had gone astray, when the Hour
was drawing nearer. Whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has
followed the right course, while whoever disobeys Allah (SWT) and His
14

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Messenger (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) erred from it and
gone far astray. To proceed:
The book Al-Bidayah (The Beginning) by the Hafiz, the Imam, the
scholarly critic, Ibn Katheer is an incomparable work regarding the study
of the events and their chronological order, the knowledge of which he
strove hard to acquire. He began by describing the start of creation – from
the creation of the Throne and the Kursi and the heavens and the Earth
and all that is in them and all that lies between them, such as the angels,
the jinn and the devils and he described the manner of Adam’s creation
(Peace be upon him). He recounted the stories of the Prophets and the
events that took place therein, up to the times of the Children of Isra’eel
and the Days of Ignorance, which ended with the advent of the final
Prophet, Muhammad r. Then he gave a detailed description of his life and
what happened after that, up to the time in which he, lived. He then wrote
a separate volume called An-Nihayah Fil – Fitan Wal-Malahim (The
Ending With Trials and Great Battles).
Furthermore, Allah inspired us to undertake the noble task of making this
book easily accessible to both the students and the scholars and then to
translate it into several languages, by Allah’s Permission.
I suggested to my brother, Yoosuf Al-Hajj, the necessity of summarizing
this book in a suitable manner, through the omission of unbeneficial
repetition, weak ahadeeth, lengthy poems, etc. I am thankful to brother
Yoosuf for assembling a team that consisted of Abdul Malik Wadih, Abu
Muslim Al-Jaza’iri, Muwaffeq Khaleel Hammad, and himself.
Darussalam funded the entire project, paying each team member for his
contribution and work. After they completed their portion of the project,
the work then went through numerous people in the Research Division of
Darussalam, who meticulously went through the work, adding and
subtracting materials. After this, the project went through another round
of editing of the Arabic material before it was sent to the translation
department. The translation was then checked for accuracy and then sent
for editing, resulting in the final project that you see before you. All praise
and thanks be to Allah for allowing us to produce such a classical work
for the first time in the English language.

In The Defence Of the True Faith
O Allah! We ask that You bless us with sincerity and success and that You
spread goodness through our hands.
‘Abdul Malik Mujahid
Jumadal-Oola 1431 A.H.

The Great Battle of Badr
Allah, Most High, says: And Allah has already made you victorious at
Badr, when you were a weak little force. So, fear Allah much (abstain
from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden and love
Allah much, perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained) that
you may be grateful." (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:123)
Allah (SWT) also says: As your Lord caused you (O Muhammad) to go
out from your home with the Truth, and verily, a party among the
Believers disliked it; disputing with you concerning the Truth after it was
made manifest, as if they were being driven to death, while they were
looking (at it). And (remember) when Allah promised you (Muslims) one
of the two parties (of the enemy i.e. either the army or the caravan) that it
should be yours, you wished that the one not armed (the caravan) should
be yours, but Allah willed to justify the truth by His Words and to cut off
the roots of the disbelievers (i.e. in the Battle of Badr). That He might
cause the Truth to triumph and bring falsehood to nothing, even though
the Mujrimoon (disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals, etc.) hate it.
(Soorah Al-Anfal 8: 5-8)
Ibn Ishaq related that ‘Urwah Ibn Az-Zubair and others, from among our
great scholars, narrated from Ibn ‘Abbas all that has been narrated to me
in part. So, I combined all their narrations with the one I have concerning
Badr. They said: “When Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, heard of the return journey of Abu Sufyan from a trade
mission in Syria, the people nursed a craving for it. So, he said: ‘This is
the caravan of the Quraish, march out to intercept it, perhaps Allah might
deliver it to you.’ Some people expressed some fear and some were
hesitant because they did not reckon that the Messenger of Allah intended
16

In The Defence Of the True Faith
war. When Abu Sufyan approached the peninsula, he began to inquire for
any news. He would ask in anxiety, due to the people’s wealth that was in
his care, all the riders that he would meet. He received the news from
some riders that Muhammad had mobilized his Companions to intercept
him and his caravan, so he should beware.”
Abu Sufyan hired Damdam Ibn ‘Amr Al-Ghifari and commanded him to
quickly go to Makkah and mobilize the Quraish to rescue their wealth,
informing them that Muhammad had marched out along with his
Companions to intercept him. Damdam immediately rushed to Makkah.
Al-Bukhari related that ‘Abdullah Ibn Mas‘ood narrated that Sa‘d Ibn
Mu‘adh was a close friend of Umayyah Ibn Khalaf; whenever Umayyah
would pass through Madinah he would stay with Sa‘d, and whenever Sa‘d
visited Makkah, he would stay with Umayyah. When Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, arrived at Madinah, Sa‘d went
to perform ‘Umrah and stayed at Umayyah’s house in Makkah. He said to
Umayyah, “Tell me of a time when (the Mosque) is empty so that I may
perform Tawaf around the Ka‘bah.” Umayyah went with him about
midday. Abu Jahl met them and said, “O Abu Safwan! Who is this man
accompanying you?” He said, “He is Sa‘d.” Abu Jahl addressed Sa‘d
saying, “I see you wandering about safely in Makkah inspite of the fact
that you have given shelter to the people who have changed their religion
(i.e. became Muslims) and have claimed that you will help them and
support them. By Allah, if you were not in the company of Abu Safwan,
you would not be able to go back to your family safely.” Sa‘d, raising his
voice, said to him, “By Allah, if you should stop me from doing this (i.e.
performing Tawaf) I would certainly prevent you from something which
is more valuable for you, that is, your passage through Madinah.” On this,
Umayyah said to him, “O Sa‘d do not raise your voice before AbulHakam, the chief of the people of the Valley (of Makkah).” Sa‘d said, “O
Umayyah, stop that! By Allah, I have heard Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of
Allah be upon him, predicting that the Muslims will kill you.” Umayyah
asked, “In Makkah?” Sa‘d said, “I do not know.” Umayyah was terribly
frightened by this news.

17

In The Defence Of the True Faith
When Umayyah returned to his family, he said to his wife, “O Umm
Safwan! Do you know what Sa‘d told me?” She said, “What did he tell
you?” He replied, “He says that Muhammad informed them (i.e. his
Companions) that they will kill me. I asked him, ‘In Makkah?’ He replied,
‘I do not know.’” Then Umayyah added, “By Allah, I will never go out of
Makkah.” But when the day of (the Ghazwah of) Badr came, Abu Jahl
called the people to war, saying, “Go and protect your caravan.” But
Umayyah disliked to go out (of Makkah). Abu Jahl came to him and said,
“O Abu Safwan! If the people see you staying behind, and you are the
chief of the people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you.”
Abu Jahl kept urging him to go until Umayyah said, “As you have forced
me to change my mind, so, by Allah, I will buy the best camel in Makkah.”
Then Umayyah said (to his wife). “O Umm Safwan, prepare what I need
(for the journey).” She said to him, “O Abu Safwan! Have you forgotten
what your Yathribi brother told you?” He said, “No, but I only want to
accompany them for a short distance.” So when Umayyah went out, he
would tie his camel next to wherever he camped. He kept on doing that
till Allah caused him to be killed at Badr.
Ibn Ishaq related that ‘Urwah Ibn Az-Zubair said: When the Quraish were
ready to march forth, they recollected what was between them and Banu
Bakr and they feared that they may be double-crossed. Then Iblees
appeared to them in the form of Suraqah Ibn Malik Ibn Ju‘thum AlMudliji, who was one of the nobles of Banu Kinanah, and said to them: “I
grant you confidence that Kinanah will not allow anything you dislike to
happen in your absence.” So, they marched forth hastily and confidently.
I say: This is the meaning of Allah’s statement: And be not like those who
come out of their homes boastfully and to be seen of men, and hinder
(men) from the Path of Allah. and Allah is Muhitun (encircling and
thoroughly comprehending) all that they do. And (remember) when
Shaitan made their (evil) deeds seem fair to them and said, “No one of the
human beings can overcome you this Day (of the Battle of Badr) and,
verily, I am your neighbor (for each and every help).” But when the two
forces came in sight of each other, he ran away and said “Verily, I have
nothing to do with you. Verily! I see what you see not. Verily! I fear Allah
for Allah is Severe in punishment. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8: 47,48)
18

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Iblees, may Allah’s curse be upon him, deceived them till they departed
and he accompanied them with his army and his flag as mentioned by
several narrators. He made them acquiescent to their death. When Iblees
saw the gravity of the situation and the hosts of angels, as well as Angel
Jibraeel, descending to aid (the Muslims), Iblees retreated and fled,
saying: “I am free of you for I see what you do not see. I fear Allah.” This
is similar to the statement of Allah: (Their allies deceived them) like
Shaitan, when he says to man: “Disbelieve in Allah.” But when (man)
disbelieves in Allah, Shaitan says: “I am free of you, I fear Allah, the Lord
of Al-‘Alamin (mankind, Jinns and all that exists)!” (Soorah Al-Hashr
59:16)
Yoonus related that Ibn Ishaq said: The Quraish filed out in arduousness
and docility. They were 950 fighting men lead by three hundred
horsemen. Women prompters also accompanied them beating the duff
(drum) and lampooning the Muslims in their songs, and retelling the war
feats of the Quraish one after the other. This was the situation of these
people as they marched forth from Makkah to Badr.
As for Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, Ibn
Ishaq said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, departed after a few nights had passed in the month of Ramadan
along with his Companions. He appointed Ibn Umm Maktoom to lead the
people in Salat and sent back Abu Lubabah from Ar-Rawha’ to govern
Madinah. He gave the war standard to Mus‘ab Ibn ‘Umair. In front of
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, were two
black flags, one was in the hands of ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib and it was known
as Al-‘Uqab. The other was with one of the Ansar.
Ibn Hisham said the flag of the Ansar was with Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh. AlUmawi said it was with Al-Hubab Ibn Al-Mundhir.
Imam Ahmad related that ‘Ali said: There was no one on horseback
among us in the Battle of Badr other than Miqdad.
Imam Ahmad related that ‘Abdullah Ibn Mas‘ood said: In the Battle of
Badr we were three to a camel. Abu Lubabah and ‘Ali were riding partners
with Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, who
19

In The Defence Of the True Faith
took the last turn. However, both of them said: “We will rather walk
(while you ride).” He replied: “I am no more in need of reward than you
too.”
Imam Ahmad also related that ‘A’ishah narrated that Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, commanded that rattles be
severed from the necks of the camel on the day of the Battle of Badr.
Al-Bukhari related that ‘Abdullah Ibn Ka‘b Ibn Malik narrated that
‘Abdullah Ibn Ka‘b said: I heard Ka‘b Ibn Malik say “I never remained
behind Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
from any expedition which he undertook except the Battle of Tabuk and
the Battle of Badr. As far as the Battle of Badr is concerned, no one was
blamed for remaining behind as Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, and the Muslims did not set out for war but to
intercept the caravan of the Quraish; but it was Allah, Who made them
confront their enemies without intending (to do so).” He related it
exclusively.
Ibn Ishaq related that then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, set out. Information reached him concerning the
Quraish’s advance to defend their caravan. He consulted with the people
and he informed them about the Quraish. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq got up and
gave an inspiring speech. ‘Umar also rose and delivered a thoughtprovoking speech. Then Miqdad Ibn ‘Amr stood up and said: “O Allah’s
Messenger! Proceed to wherever Allah guides you and we are with you.
By Allah, we will not say to you as the Children of Isra’eel said to Moosa,
‘Go you and your Lord and fight you two; we are sitting here, (Soorah AlMa'idah 5.24) but (we say), proceed to fight, you and your Lord and we
are with you both in battle. By the One Who sent you with the Truth if
you advance up to Barkal-Ghimad, we shall fight alongside you against
anyone who blocks our path until we are able to reach it.” Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, commended him
and supplicated for him and then said: “O people, advise me.” By this he
was referring to the Ansar since they were in the majority and at the
Pledge of ‘Aqabah they had said: O Messenger of Allah! We are not under
any obligation to you until you reach our land. When you reach us you
will be under our protection and we shall defend you from that which we
20

In The Defence Of the True Faith
defend our wives and children. The Prophet was thus afraid that the Ansar
might not think it necessary to fight on his behalf unless he was attacked
in Madinah.
When he said that, Sa‘d Ibn Muadh replied: “By Allah, perhaps you are
referring to us, O Messenger of Allah?” When the Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, replied in the affirmative, he continued:
“We have believed in you and accepted what you say. We have testified
that what you brought is the truth, and on the basis of that we have given
you our pledge and sworn to hear and obey you. So proceed, O Messenger
of Allah, and do whatever you will, for we are with you. By Him Who
sent you with the Truth, if you approached the sea with us and dived into
it, we would dive into it with you and not a single man would remain
behind. We are not against your confronting the enemy with us tomorrow.
We are steadfast in war, truthful in meeting. Perhaps, Allah will show you
something of us which will gladden your heart. So proceed with the
blessings of Allah.” So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, advanced with full spirit following the reply of Sa‘d.
He then said: “Go forth and be cheerful. Allah has promised me one of
the two parties. By Allah, it is as if I can already see the places where
those people will die.” This is how Ibn Ishaq, may Allah be pleased with
him, related it.
The story has corroborating reports from numerous versions. From them
is the one related by Al-Bukhari in his Saheeh from Ibn Mas‘ood who
narrated: I witnessed Al-Miqdad Ibn Al-Aswad in a scene which would
have been dearer to me than anything had I been the hero of that scene.
He (i.e. Al-Miqdad) came to the Prophet while the Prophet was urging the
Muslims to fight with the pagans. Al-Miqdad said, “We will not say as
the people of Moosa said: ‘Go you and your Lord and fight you two. We
are sitting have.’ (Soorah Al-Ma’idah 5:24). But we shall fight on your
right and on your left and in front of you and behind you.” I saw the face
of the Prophet brighten up with happiness, as that saying delighted him.”
AlBukhari related it exclusively in various places in his Saheeh from the
Hadith of Mukhariq.
Ibn Ishaq said: Then Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, marched forward from Dhafiran through a mountain pass called
21

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Asafir and then he descended into a plain region called Ad-Dabah with
Al-Hannan, which is a huge sand dune the size of a mighty mountain,
being on his right. Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, descended in the area close to Badr. He rode with one
of his Companions. Ibn Hisham said it was Abu Bakr.
Ibn Ishaq related something similar to what Muhammad Ibn Yahyah Ibn
Habban narrated to me: Until they met an old Arab man and they asked
him about any news that has reached him concerning the movement of the
Quraish as well as that of Muhammad and his Companions. The old man
said: “I will not inform you two until you tell me where you come from.”
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“If you inform us, we will also inform you.” The man said: “Then it is tit
for tat.” "Regarding the current position of Allah’s Messenger, if what I
was informed has some truth, then they should be at such-and-such a place
by today,” which happened to be the exact spot where the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was. The man continued:
“It also reached me that the Quraish set out on such-and-such day and if
my informer was truthful to me, then by today they should be at such-andsuch place,” indicating the exact place where the Quraish were. When the
man had informed them, he asked: “So where are you both from?” The
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to
him: “We are from water” and then turned away from him. The old man
became perplexed, and kept repeating: “From water, what water? It is the
water of Iraq?” Ibn Hisham said that the old man was known as Sufyan
Ad-Damri.
Ibn Ishaq said afterwards: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessing of
Allah be upon him, returned to his Companions. In the night, he sent ‘Ali
Ibn Abi Talib, Zubair Ibn Al-Awwam and Sa‘d Ibn Abi Waqqas among a
group of people to the oasis region of Badr to scout for news. According
to what was related to me by Yazeed Ibn Rooman from ‘Urwah Ibn AzZubair, they caught two water carriers of the Quraish. They were Aslam,
a slave boy of Banu Al-Hajjaj and ‘Areed Abu Yasar, a slave boy of Banu
Al‘As Ibn Sa‘eed. They brought both of them back to the camp while
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was
praying. They began questioning them and both of them informed that
they were water carriers for the Quraish and that they had been sent to
22

In The Defence Of the True Faith
fetch water. Some of the Muslims disliked this piece of news which they
heard from the two boys. They had hoped that the boys would be from
Abu Sufyan, so they beat the boys severely until they said: “We are from
Abu Sufyan,” so they left them alone. The Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, bowed, went into prostration and did the
tasleem (i.e. ended his prayer) and said: “When they told you the truth,
you beat them and when they told you a lie you left them alone. By Allah
they spoke the truth when they said they were from the Quraish.” Then he
turned to the boys and asked them: “What news do you have of the
Quraish?” They said: “They are behind this mound that you see.” The
Prophet asked: “How many are they?” They replied, “Very many.” He
asked: “What are their numbers?” They replied, “We do not know.” The
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked
them: “How many camels do they slaughter each day?” They replied:
“Nine or ten a day.” The Prophet said: “They numbered between 900 and
1,000.” Then he asked the boys again: “Which of the Quraish notables are
among them?” They replied: “ ‘Utbah Ibn Rabee‘ah, Shaibah Ibn
Rabee‘ah, Abul-Bakhtari Ibn Hisham, Hakeem Ibn Hizam, Nawfal Ibn
Khuwailid, Al-Harith Ibn ‘Amir Ibn Nawfal, Tu’aimah Ibn ‘Adi Ibn
Nawfal, An-Nadr Ibn Al-Harith, Zam‘ah Ibn Al-Aswad, Abu Jahl Ibn
Hisham, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf,
Nabeeh and Munabbih, the two sons of Al-Hajjaj, Suhail Ibn ‘Amr and
‘Amr Ibn Abd Wudd.”
The Prophet then turned to the Muslims and said: “Here is Makkah
confronting you with its choicest sons.”
Ibn Ishaq related: When Abu Sufyan saw that the caravan was now safe,
he sent a message to the Quraish saying: “You have come out to defend
your caravan, your men, and your wealth. Allah (SWT) has saved them,
so go back.” However, Abu Jahl said: “We shall not retrun home until we
reach Badr, camp three days there, slaughter camels, feast and drink wine
and have the girls sing and dance for us. The Arabs must hear of us and
our march and continue to fear us forever.”
Ibn Ishaq said that the Quraish proceeded until they reached the furthest
point of the valley behind AlAqanqal, a huge sand dune in the middle of
the valley of Yal Yal between Badr and Al-Aqanqal, and camped there.
23

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Meanwhile, the well of Badr was situated in the nearest point within the
valley of Yal Yal in direction of Madinah.
I say: It is concerning this that Allah said: (And remember) when you (the
Muslim army) were on the near side of the valley, and they on the farther
side, and the caravan on the ground lower than you. (Soorah AlAnfal 8:42)
i.e., in the direction of the sea-shore. Even if you had made a mutual
appointment to meet, you would certainly have failed in the appointment,
but (you met) that Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained (in
His Knowledge). (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:42)
Then Allah sent rain so that the plain of the valley became firm and the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and his
Companions found the earth to be compact which permitted them swift
movement. Concerning that, Allah says: ...and He caused water (rain) to
descend on you from the sky, to clean you thereby and to remove from
you the Rijz (whispering, evil-suggestions, etc.) of Shaitan, and to
strengthen your hearts, and make your feet firm thereby. (Soorah Al-Anfal
8:11) Thus, Allah mentions that He purifies them inwardly and outwardly;
He planted their feet firmly, embolden their hearts, and removed from
their hearts the insinuations of Shaitan, terror and dangerous suggestions.
All these are a consolidation both internally and externally. Allah also sent
down on them help from above them as contained in the Verse:
(Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels, “Verily, I am with you,
so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of
those who have disbelieved, so strike them over the necks, (Soorah AlAnfal 8:12) i.e. on the heads, …and smite over all their fingers and toes,
(Soorah Al-Anfal 8:12) i.e. so that they may not be able to hold their
weapon firmly. This is because they defied and disobeyed Allah (SWT)
and His Messenger. And whoever defies and disobeys Allah and His
Messenger, then, verily, Allah is Severe in punishment. This is the
torment, so taste it, and surely for the disbelievers is the torment of the
Fire. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:13, 14)
Imam Ahmad related that ‘Ali said: “There was not a horse rider among
us except Miqdad and none was spared from slumber except Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, who stood praying
24

In The Defence Of the True Faith
and crying under the tree till daybreak.” An-Nasa’i also related it from
Bundar from Ghundar from Shu‘bah.
The night of the Battle of Badr was the night of Jumu‘ah, the 17th of
Ramadan, the second year of Hijrah. The Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, spent the night praying by the foot of the
tree. He used to repeat profusely in his prostration: “Ya Hayyu Ya
Qayyoom.” (O the Ever-Living, the One Who sustains and protects all
that exists).
Ibn Ishaq said: It was related to me from some men of Banu Salimah that
they narrated that Al-Hubab Ibn Al-Mundhir Ibn Al-Jamooh said: “O
Messenger of Allah, is this a place where Allah has directed you and thus
we are not permitted to move forward or backward, or is it an opinion: a
war strategy?” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said: “It is indeed an opinion: a war strategy.” Then Al-Hubab
said: “Well, O Messenger of Allah, this is not a good position. Lead the
people further ahead till you reach a well closest to the enemies. Let us
camp there and fill up all the wells behind us. Then let us build a cistern
and fill it with water. So when we fight the enemy, we shall be able to
drink and they will have no water.” The Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said in response: “You have indeed given
us good advice.”
Ibn Ishaq related that in the morning, the Quraish advanced. When the
Messenger of Allah saw them approaching from the Aqanqil sand dune
into the valley, he exclaimed: “O Allah, here is the Quraish coming in
their conceit and their haughtiness challenging You and belying Your
Messenger. O Allah, grant me victory which You have promised. O Allah,
destroy them this morning.”
When they settled down, a number of the Quraish, including Hakeem Ibn
Hizam, dashed for the water cistern of Allah’s Messenger to drink from
it. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said: “Let them do so,” and none of them were able to drank from the
cistern, except that he was killed with the exception of Hakeem Ibn
Hizam. Afterwards, he became a good Muslim and would say whenever
25

In The Defence Of the True Faith
he became fervent in his oath: “By Him Who rescued me on the Day of
Badr.”
I say: On that day, the Companions of Allah’s Messenger numbered three
hundred and thirteen men.
In Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Al-Bara’ narrated: “We used to say that the
warriors of Badr were over threehundred-and-ten, just like the
companions of Toloot (Saul) who crossed the river with him; and none
could cross the river with him but a believer.” Al-Bukhari also related
from him that: “I and Ibn ‘Umar were considered too young (to take part)
in the Battle of Badr, and the number of the Emigrant warriors were over
sixty (men) and the Ansar were over two hundred and forty nine (249).”
Allah says: (And remember) when Allah showed them to you as few in
your (i.e. Muhammad’s) dream; if He had shown them to you as many,
you would surely have been discouraged, and you would surely have
disputed in making a decision. But Allah saved (you). (Soorah Al-Anfal
8:43) That occurred in his dream which he had that night. It was also said
that it was when he slept in the hut and he ordered the people not to
commence fighting until they were permitted to do so. The enemy was
coming closer and Abu Bakr As-Siddiq kept waking him saying: “Awake,
O Messenger of Allah, they are getting closer,” but, Allah had already
shown them to him a little while earlier. This narration is mentioned by
Al-Umawi though it is extremely strange.
Allah (SWT) also says: And (remember) when you met (the army of the
disbelievers on the day of the Battle of Badr), He showed them to you as
few in your eyes and He made you appear as few in their eyes, so that
Allah might accomplish a matter already ordained (in His Knowledge).
(Soorah Al-Anfal 8:44)
When the two armies met, Allah made it seeming to each group that the
other was small so that one might pounce on the other. This is from the
pinnacle of wisdom (which belongs only to Allah). This is not
contradictory to the words of Allah in Soorah Aal ‘Imran: There has
already been a sign for you (O Jews) in the two armies that met (in combat
i.e. the Battle of Badr): One was fighting in the Cause of Allah, and as for
26

In The Defence Of the True Faith
the other (they) were disbelievers. They (the Believers) saw them (the
disbelievers) with their own eyes twice their number (although they were
thrice their number). And Allah supports with His Victory whom He
pleases. (Soorah Aal ‘Imran [3]:13) This is because the meaning of that,
based on the more correct of two views, is that the army of the polytheists
saw the number of the army of the Believers as twice as much as their
own. Based on the correct opinion, this was at the point of the encounter
and the actual combat. Allah threw weakness and fear in the hearts of the
unbelievers and beguiled them first by seeing themselves small in number
at the point of fighting. Secondly, Allah strengthened the Believers with
His help; thus He made the Believers seem more than them in multiples
so that their resolve became weakened and they became incapacitated, and
thus they were conquered. This is why Allah (SWT) says:
And Allah supports with His Victory whom He pleases." Verily, in this is
a lesson for those who understand. (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:13)
Ibn Ishaq related that Abu Ishaq Ibn Yasar and others narrated to me that
some people of knowledge from the elders of the Ansar said that when the
Quraish settled down, they sent ‘Umair Ibn Wahb Al-Jumahi to assess the
number of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, of
Muhammad, peace be upon him. He galloped on his horse around the
army and then returned to them and said: “Three hundred men, slightly
more or less. But grant me more time so that I may see their ambushes
and reinforcement.” So he went around the valley till he went far but he
did not see anything. So he returned and said to them: “I did not see
anything but, O Quraish, I have seen misfortune bearing death and
showers of Yathrib bearing destruction. I saw people without credible
resistance and no recourse except to their swords. By Allah I do not see
you killing one of them except that they would have killed two of you. If
they were to kill you with their numbers, then there will be no good life
afterwards. So consider your opinion on this.”
Then ‘Utbah stood to address the people: “O Quraish! What use do you
have for meeting Muhammad and his Companions? By Allah, if you
killed them, you would not cease to look at the face of one you hate to see
(in death). You would have killed your paternal or maternal cousins or a
man from your own kinsfolk. So let’s return and leave Muhammad to the
27

In The Defence Of the True Faith
rest of the Arabs to deal with him. If they succeed in killing him, that is
exactly what you desire, if the matter is contrary to that, then he will warm
close to you and you would not experience from him what you dislike.”
Hakeem said that I proceeded until I came to Abu Jahl and he had already
drawn out his arm. So I said to him: “O Abul-Hakam, ‘Utbah sent me to
you with such-and-such (information).” He said: “By Allah, he has been
afflicted by magical spell the moment he saw Muhammad and his
Companions. No, by Allah, we will not retreat until Allah decides between
us and Muhammad. As for what ‘Utbah said, he became faint-hearted only
when he saw Muhammad and his Companions and also because his son
is on their side and he nurses fear for his safety.” When what Abu Jahl
said reached ‘Utbah, he said, “The one who will be returned empty handed
and the one whose lungs are inflated (out of fear) will soon be
distinguished between me and him.” Then ‘Utbah sought a helmet so as
to protect his head and there was no helmet in the entire Quraish army due
to the huge size of his head, so he wound his garment around his head.
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, had
arranged his Companions and mobilized them efficiently. At-Tirmidhi
related that ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn ‘Awf said: “The Messenger of Allah
arranged our ranks by night in the Battle of Badr.”
Imam Ahmad related that Abu Ayyoob said: “Allah’s Messenger arranged
our ranks in the Battle of Badr and then someone went outside the line.
The Prophet cast his glance at him and ordered: “(Come here) with me!
(Come here) with me!!” Ahmad related it exclusively. The chain of this
narration is hasan.
Ibn Ishaq related that Habban Ibn Wasi‘ Ibn Habban narrated to me from
some of his elders that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, straightened the rows of his Companions at the Battle of
Badr. In his hand was an arrow with which he straightened the people.
Then he passed by Sawad Ibn Ghaziyyah, an ally of Banu ‘Adiyy Ibn
Najjar sticking out of the line. The Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, pricked him in the stomach with the arrow
and said “Straighten your line, O Sawad.” He said: “You have injured me
and Allah has sent you with the truth and justice, give me back my right.”
28

In The Defence Of the True Faith
So Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, raised
his shirt from his stomach and said: “Retaliate.” Sawad embraced and
kissed the Prophet’s stomach. “What did you do that for, O Sawad?” the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked. He
said: “O Messenger of Allah, just what you have seen. I had wished that
the last acquaintance with you be that my skin touches yours.” The
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
supplicated for him and for what he said.
The two armies arrayed against each other and the enemy filed in the
presence of Ar-Rahman. The leader of the Prophets sought help from his
Lord, and the Companions were boisterous with varieties of supplications
to the Lord of the Earth of the heaven, the One Who Listens to
supplication and the One Who Removes tribulation. The first person to be
killed among the polytheists was Al-Aswad Ibn ‘AbdulAsad AlMakhzoomi.
Ibn Ishaq said: He was an extremely bad-tempered man. He said: “I swear
by Allah that I shall surely drink from the water cistern, or destroy it or
die in the quest of it. He stepped out and Hamzah Ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib
went for him. When they met, Hamzah amputated his leg from the shin.
He fell on his back with his blood streaming toward his colleagues. He
scrambled to the cistern and threw himself into it intending to fulfill his
oath. Hamzah followed him and struck him until he killed him inside the
cistern.
Al-Umawi said, thereby, ‘Utbah Ibn Rabee‘ah became agitated and
wanted to demonstrate his bravery. He emerged and stood in between his
brother Shaibah and his son Al-Waleed, and advanced half way between
both armies and challenged the Muslims to a duel.
Three youths from the Ansar emerged to accept the challenge. They were
‘Awf and Mu‘adh the sons of Al-Harith and their mother was Al-Afra‘,
while the third youth was ‘Abdullah Ibn Rawahah, according to a report.
“Who are you?” the Quraish queried. “A company of the Ansar,” the
youths answered. The Quraish said: “We do not have any need for you.”
In another narration they said: “We need our equals in nobility. Send men
from our cousins to take up the challenge.” Then a man from the ranks of
29

In The Defence Of the True Faith
the Quraish announced to the Muslims: “O Muhammad, send to us our
equals from our own people!” So the Messenger of Allah said: “Rise, O
‘Ubaidah Ibn Al-Harith, rise O Hamzah, rise O ‘Ali.”
According to Al-Umawi who related from a group of the Ansar that when
they (some men of the Ansar) emerged from the lines to pick up the
challenge of the Quraish, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, disliked that as his first encounter with his enemies
and he desired that his kindred should be the ones to draw the first blood.
So he commanded the Ansar to return to their lines, and then he ordered
those three to advance.
Ibn Ishaq continued: When we had come close to them, the Quraish asked:
“Who are you?” This is a proof that they were decked in military garment
so they could not be recognized from their weapons. ‘Ubaidah identified
himself, as did Hamzah and ‘Ali. The Quraish said: “Yes, our equals in
nobility.” ‘Ubaidah, the eldest of the three Muslim swordsmen, dueled
with ‘Utbah. Hamzah dueled with Shaibah, while ‘Ali dueled with AlWaleed Ibn ‘Utbah. As for Hamzah, he did not tarry before he killed
Shaibah; ‘Ali also wasted no time in killing Al-Waleed. Striking each
other, ‘Ubaidah and ‘Utbah were mortally injured. Hamzah and ‘Ali
charged against ‘Utbah with their weapons and killed him. They carried
their injured fellow back to their remaining compatriots. May Allah be
pleased with them all.
It is established in the Saheehain that Abu Dharr used to swear that this
Verse: These two opponents (Believers and disbelievers) dispute with
each other about their Lord (Soorah Al-Hajj 22:19) was revealed
concerning Hamzah and his opponent as well ‘Utbah and his opponent on
the day that they dueled in the Battle of Badr.
I say that ‘Ubaidah was Ibn Al-Harith Ibn Muttalib Ibn ‘Abd Manaf.
When they brought him injured to the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, they laid him at his feet. He put his cheek
against the Messenger of Allah’s feet and said: “O Messenger of Allah, if
Abu Talib saw me, he would know that I am more worthy of his statement:
‘We protect him till we die in the effort
30

In The Defence Of the True Faith
though we may neglect our children and wives.”
He then breathed his last. May Allah be pleased with him. The Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “I bear witness
that you are a martyr.”
It is recorded in the Saheehain from Anas that Al-Harithah Ibn Suraqah
was killed in the Battle of Badr by a stray arrow which hit him. His mother
came to the Prophet and said, “O Allah’s Messenger! Inform me about
Harithah. If he is in Paradise, I shall remain patient, but if it is not, then
you shall see what I do (i.e. of wailing which had not been prohibited at
the time)?” Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
told her: “Woe to you! Have you lost your senses? There are wonderful
gardens and your son is in the (most superior) garden of Paradise, AlFirdaws.”
In Saheeh Al-Bukhari, Abu Usaid said: Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, told us on the day of Badr: “If the
polytheists encircle you, resist them with showers of arrows.”
Ibn Ishaq related that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, was in the tent with Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him,
i.e. while he was seeking the help of Allah, to Whom belongs Might and
Majesty. Allah says: (Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and
He answered you (saying): “I will help you with a thousand of the angels
each behind the other (following one another) in succession. Allah made
it only as glad tidings, and that your hearts be at rest therewith. And there
is no victory except from Allah. Verily, Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.
(Soorah Al-Anfal 8:9,10)
Al-Umawi and others related that the Muslims supplicated to Allah in
seeking help by His Honor, seeking assistance by Him. Allah says: …with
a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in
succession. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:9) i.e., following you and as a
reinforcement for your group. Al-‘Awfi related it from Ibn ‘Abbas. This
is also the opinion of Mujahid, Ibn Katheer, ‘Abdur-Rahman Ibn Zaid and
others. Abu Kudainah from Qaboos through his father from Ibn ‘Abbas
that “Murdifeen” means each angel behind the other. In another narration
31

In The Defence Of the True Faith
from him with this chain, “Murdifeen” means (each angel) following the
step of one another in succession. This is also the opinion of Abu Zabyan,
AdDahhak and Qatadah. ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talhah Al-Walibi related from Ibn
‘Abbas that he said: “Allah reinforced his Prophet and the Believers with
a thousand angels. Jibraeel led five hundred angels on one flank, and
Meekael led another five hundred angels on the other flank. This is the
more popular narration.
Al-Baihaqi also related that ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased with
him, said: “On the day of the Battle of Badr, I killed a number of the
enemies. Then I rushed to see what had happened to the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. When I got to him, he
was in prostration saying: Ya Hayyu! Ya Qayyoom!! Ya Hayyu! Ya
Qayyoom!! (meaning: O the Ever-Living, the One Who sustains and
protects all that exists) without adding anything further. Then I returned
to fight. Soon after, I came back and still found him in prostration saying
the same words. I went back to the fighting and then came back (for the
third time) and he was still in the position of prostration saying the same
thing till Allah granted victory at his hands.” An-Nasa’i had related it in
Al-Yawm Wal-Lailah.
Al-Bukhari related from Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet was in a tent built for
him on the day of the Battle of Badr saying, “O Allah! I ask you the
fulfillment of Your Covenant and Promise. O Allah! If You wish (to
destroy the Believers) You will never be worshipped after today.” Abu
Bakr caught him by the hand and said, “This is sufficient, O Allah’s
Messenger! You have asked Allah earnestly.” The Prophet was clad in his
armor at that time. He went out, saying: Their multitude will be put to
flight, and they will show their backs. Nay, but the Hour is their appointed
time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and
more bitter. (Soorah Al-Qamar 54:45,46) This Verse was revealed in
Makkah but its confirmation came on the day of the Battle of Badr as
related by Ibn Abi Hatim from ‘Ikrimah who said: When the Verse: Their
multitude will be put to flight, and they will show their backs. (Soorah AlQamar 54:45) was revealed, ‘Umar said: “Which multitude will be put to
flight and which multitude will prevail?” ‘Umar added: “When it was the
day of the Battle of Badr, I saw Allah’s Messenger jumping in his armor
while he was saying: Their multitude will be put to flight, and they will
32

In The Defence Of the True Faith
show their backs. Nay, but the Hour is their appointed time (for their full
recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter. (Soorah
Al-Qamar 54:45, 46) Only that day did I realize its interpretation.
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, came
out of his tent to his men and urged them on with the following words:
“By Him in Whose Hands is Muhammad’s life, if any man fights them
today and is killed while displaying steadfastness and hope in Allah,
advancing and not retreating, Allah will surely admit him into Paradise.”
Upon hearing this, ‘Umair Ibn Al-Humam, the brother of Banu Salimah,
while holding some dates in his hands that he was eating, said: “Bakh,
bakh (expressing wonder and pleasure)! Between me and my entering
Paradise is these people killing me?” Then he flung the dates in his hands
and drew his sword and fought the enemies until he was killed. May Allah
be pleased with him.
Ibn Jareer mentioned that ‘Umair, may Allah be pleased with him, fought
while he was saying:
We hastened to Allah without provision
Except piety and striving for the Hereafter
And perseverance upon Jihad in the way of Allah
Every provision is bound to be exhausted
Except piety, righteousness and uprightness
Imam Ahmad related from ‘Ali that: Had you seen us on the day of Badr
while we kept close to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him? Among us, his fighting position was the closest to the
enemies. He was the bravest of people on that day.”
An-Nasa’i also related that ‘Ali said: “Whenever we met the enemy and
the confrontation became heated, we would seek the protection of the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him.”
33

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Imam Ahmad related that ‘Ali said: It was said to ‘Ali and Abu Bakr on
the day of Badr that Jibraeel was with one of you and Meekael was with
the other while Israfeel, the mighty angel was observing the course of the
battle and he did not participate; or he said: observing the rows.
Al-Bukhari related that Mu‘adh Ibn Rifa‘ah Ibn Rafi‘ Az-Zuraqi narrated
that his father, who was one of those who witnessed the Battle of Badr,
said: “Jibraeel came to the Messenger of Allah and said, ‘How do you
look upon the warriors of Badr among yourselves?’ The Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said, ‘As the best of the
Muslims,’ or something similar. On that, Jibraeel said, “And so are the
angels who participated in the Badr (battle)’.”
Allah said: (Remember) when your Lord inspired the angels, “Verily, I
am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. I will cast terror into
the hearts of those who have disbelieved, so strike them over the necks...”
(Soorah Al-Anfal 8:12) i.e. on the heads. …and smite over all their fingers
and toes. (Soorah AlAnfal 8:12)
It is recorded in Saheeh Muslim that Ibn ‘Abbas said: “(On that day) a
Muslim was chasing a disbeliever who was going ahead of him, he heard
over him the swishing of the whip and the voice of the rider saying: Go
ahead, Haizoom! He glanced at the polytheist in front of him and he had
fallen down on his back. When he looked at him (carefully, he found that)
there was a scar on his nose and his face was torn as if it had been lashed
with a whip, and had turned green with its poison. The Ansari came to the
Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, and related this (event) to him.
He said: You have told the truth. This was the help from the third heaven.
The Muslims that day (i. e. the day of the Battle of Badr) killed seventy
persons and captured seventy.”
Ibn Ishaq said: Abu Usaid Malik Ibn Rabee‘ah, who participated in the
Battle of Badr and had lost his sight, said: If I were at Badr and I still had
my sight, I would have shown you, without any doubt or difference, the
mountain pass through which the angels came.”
When the angels descended and Iblees saw them and Allah inspired them:
Verily, I am with you, so keep firm those who have believed. (Soorah Al34

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Anfal 8:12) Their strengthening was that the angels would appear to a man
in the form of a man whom they knew and would say to him: “Glad tiding
for verily they are inconsequential for Allah is with you. Attack them!”
And when Iblees saw the angels: ‘…he ran away and said, “Verily, I have
nothing to do with you. Verily! I see what you see not.” (Soorah Al-Anfal
8:48) He had assumed the form of Suraqah. Abu Jahl came and was
inciting his companions saying: “You will not be daunted by Suraqah’s
betrayal of you for he has a secret pact with Muhammad and his
Companions.” And then he added: “By Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, we shall not
retreat until we scatter Muhammad and his Companions into the
mountains, and do not kill them, rather capture them in their multitude.
Al-Waqidi narrated from Hakeem Ibn Hizam: “They said: when the battle
started the Prophet of Allah raised his hands seeking victory from Allah
and what He had promised. He said: “O Allah if they overcome this group
then polytheism will prevail and the religion will not be established for
You.” And Abu Bakr was saying, “By Allah, you will certainly be helped
and your face will certainly be brightened.” Then Allah sent down one
thousand angels in succession during the hemming in by the enemy. The
Messenger said: “Glad tidings, O Abu Bakr here is Jibraeel wearing a
yellow turban holding the rein of his horse between the heavens and the
Earth. When he descended to the Earth, he was out of my sight for a while
then reappeared dusty and saying: ‘The help of Allah came when you
beseeched Him.’”
Rabee‘ Ibn Anas related that: On the day of Badr, the people used to
distinguish between the corpses of the enemy slain by their hands, and
those slain by the hands of the angels with a cut above the neck and
lacerations on the fingertips, and [the wound] being charred, similar to the
use of a whip made of fire.
When the angels descended in support [of the Muslims], the Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, awoke after dozing
off and gave the glad tiding to Abu Bakr saying: “O Abu Bakr, glad
tidings, here is Jibraeel riding his horse in the thick of the of sandstorm,”
i.e., the battlefield. Then Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, went out of the tent in his armor and kept inspiring the
Muslims to fight on, giving them glad tidings of Paradise and enbolding
35

In The Defence Of the True Faith
them with information of the descent of the angels on the battlefield
fighting on their side. Tranquility and confidence descended upon them.
The slumber which was an indication of tranquility, firmness and Eeman
(faith) had come to pass as Allah said: (Remember) when He covered you
with a slumber as a security from Him... (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:11) This is
similar to what occurred afterwards in the Battle of Uhud, based on the
text of the Qur’an. Ibn Ma‘sood said: “Slumber during battle is from
Eeman and slumber during the course of Salat is from Nifaq (hypocrisy).”
And Allah (SWT) said: (O disbelievers) if you ask for a judgment, now
has the judgment come unto you and if you cease (to do wrong), it will be
better for you, and if you return (to the attack), so shall We return, and
your forces will be of no avail to you, however numerous it be, and verily,
Allah is with the believers. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:19)
Ziyad related from Ibn Ishaq that afterwards, the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, took a handful of pebbles,
turned to the direction of the Quraish and said: “Disfigure their faces.”
Then he threw it in their direction and commanded his Companions to
attack. The enemy was defeated and Allah caused the death of some of
the leaders of Quraish, while others from their nobility were captured.
Ibn Ishaq also mentioned that when Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, was goading his Companions to fight on,
he threw dust at the polytheists and then Allah defeated them. The Prophet
then returned to his tent along with Abu Bakr. Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh and some
Ansar stood by the door of the tent with swords drawn as if they had turned
away from the Mushrikeen to face the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him.
Ibn Ishaq added that the Ansar objected to the idea of taking captives. The
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saw the
objection in the face of Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh. The Messenger of Allah, peace
and blessing, of Allah be upon him, asked: “I see that you dislike what the
people have done.” He replied: “Yes, by Allah, O Messenger of Allah.
This is the first encounter Allah has caused us to have with the people of
polytheism and their decimation is more beloved to me than their
preservation.”
36

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Ibn Ishaq related from ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Abbas that the Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said to his Companions on the day of
Badr: “I am aware that some men from Banu Hashim and others have been
forced to march out (to fight) while having no intention to fight against
us. So whoever comes across anyone from Banu Hashim, do not kill him;
whoever comes across Abul-Bakhtari Ibn Hisham Ibn Al-Harith Ibn Asad,
do not kill him; whoever comes across Al-‘Abbas Ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib,
(the uncle of Allah’s Messenger), do not kill him for he was forced to
march out.”
Ibn ‘Abbas continued: Abu Hudhaifah said (in response to the Prophet’s
command): “Should we kill our own fathers, children, brothers and
comrades and then let Al-‘Abbas go? By Allah, if I come across him, I
shall let him taste the sword.”
When this statement of Abu Hudhaifah reached Allah’s Messenger, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, he told ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab: “O
Abu Hafs.” ‘Umar said: “That was the day Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, gave me the nickname of Abu Hafs.”
“Would anyone strike the face of the uncle of the Prophet?” Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, continued.
‘Umar responded: “O Messenger of Allah, permit me to chop off his
head with the sword, for, by Allah, he has become a Munafiq
(hypocrite).”
Abu Hudhaifah said: “I have not remained at peace from the day I said
that statement. I never ceased to be afraid of it (i.e. its consequence) and
being killed as a martyr appears to be the only redemption.” He was
eventually killed as a martyr at the Battle of Yamamah. Allah be pleased
with him.

The Killing of Abul-Bakhtari Ibn Hisham
Ibn Ishaq related that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, had forbidden that Abul-Bakhtari be killed because he was
the most abstentious of people from (harming) Allah’s Messenger while
he was in Makkah. He neither participated in hurting him nor did anything
37

In The Defence Of the True Faith
distasteful that would reach the Prophet. He was one of those who
executed the repudiation of the boycott. AlMujadhdhar Ibn Dhiyad AlBalawi, an ally of the Ansar met him one day and said: “Allah’s
Messenger has forbidden us from killing you.” Meanwhile, AbulBakhatari was with a friend who had traveled with him from Makkah, his
name was Junadah Ibn Mulaihah. So he asked: “What about my friend?”
AlMujadhdhar replied: “I shall not let your friend go for the Messenger
of Allah commanded us regarding you only.” Abul-Bakhtari said: “No, by
Allah, then I and he shall both die together. I do not like that the women
of the Quraish talk about me that I abandon my friend in my covetousness
of the life. Then AbulBakhatari said:
I shall not surrender a free-born friend
Until he dies or he is let off
So they fought and Al-Mujadhdhar Ibn Dhiyad killed him.

The Killing of Umayyah Ibn Khalaf
Narrated ‘Abdur-Rahman Ibn ‘Awf: I got an agreement written between
me and Umayyah Ibn Khalaf that Umayyah would look after my property
(or family) in Makkah and I would look after his in Madinah. When I
mentioned the word ‘Ar-Rahman’ in the document, Umayyah said, 'I do
not know ‘Ar-Rahman.’ Write down to me your name, (with which you
called yourself) in the pre-lslamic period of Ignorance.” So, I wrote my
name ‘ ‘Abd ‘Amr’. On the day (of the Battle) of Badr, when all the people
went to sleep, I went up the hill to protect him. Bilal saw him (i.e.
Umayyah) and went to a gathering of Ansar and said, “(Here is) Umayyah
Ibn Khalaf! Woe to me if he escapes!” So, a group of Ansar went out with
Bilal to follow us (‘Abdur-Rahman and Umayyah). Being afraid that they
would catch us, I left Umayyah’s son for them to keep them busy but the
Ansar killed the son and insisted on following us. Umayyah was a fat man,
and when they approached us, I told him to kneel down, and he knelt, and
I laid myself on him to protect him, but the Ansar killed him by passing
their swords underneath me, and one of them injured my foot with his
sword. (The sub-narrator added, “ 'Abdur-Rahman used to show us the
trace of the wound on the back of his foot.”)

The Killing of Abu Jahl, May Allah’s Curse be Upon
Him
It is recorded in the Saheehain that ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn ‘Awf said:
“While I was standing in the battle array on the day of Badr, I looked
toward my right and my left, and found myself between two boys, who
were quite young in age, from the Ansar. I wished I were between stronger
persons. One of them made a sign to me and said: ‘Uncle, do you
recognize Abu Jahl?’ I said: ‘Yes. What do you want to do with him, O
my nephew?’ He said: ‘I have been told that he abuses the Messenger of
Allah, may peace be upon him. By Allah, in Whose Hands is my life, if I
see him (I will with him) and will not leave him until one of us who is
destined to die earlier is killed.’ The narrator said: I wondered at this. Then
the other made a sign to me and said similar words. Soon afterward, I saw
Abu Jahl. He was moving about among men. I said to the two boys: ‘Don’t
you see? He is the man you were inquiring about.’ (As soon as they heard
this), they dashed toward him, struck him with their swords until he was
killed. Then they returned to the Messenger of Allah, may peace be upon
him, and informed him of this. He asked: ‘Which of you has killed him?’
Each one of them said: ‘I have killed him.’ He said: ‘Have you wiped your
swords?’ They said: ‘No’.
He examined their swords and said: ‘Both of you have killed him.’ He
then decided that the belongings of Abu Jahl be handed over to (the two
young boys) Mu‘adh Ibn ‘Amr Ibn Al-Jamooh and Mu‘adh Ibn
Afra.”
Also in the Saheehain, from the Hadith of Abu Sulaiman At-Taimi that
Anas Ibn Malik said: “Allah’s Messenger said on the day of the Battle of
Badr: “Who will go and see what has happened to Abu Jahl?” Ibn
Mas‘ood went and saw him struck by the two sons of ‘Afra’ and was on
the throes of death. Ibn Mas‘ood said, “Are you Abu Jahl?” Abu Jahl
replied, “Can there be a man more superior to the one whom you have
killed (or [he said] his own folk have killed.)?”
In the version of Bukhari from Ibn Mas‘ood, it is recorded that he (Ibn
Mas‘ood) approached Abu Jahl and said: “Has Allah humiliated you?”
39

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Abu Jahl said: “Is there a man stronger than the one whom you have
killed?”
Al-Bukhari also related that Az-Zubair said: “I met ‘Ubaidah Ibn S‘eed
Ibn Al-‘As on the day (of the Battle) of Badr and he was covered with
armor; so much so that only his eyes were visible. He was surnamed Abu
Dhatul-Karish. He said (proudly), ‘I am Abu Dhatlal-Karsh.’ I attacked
him with the spear and pierced his eye and he died. I put my foot over his
body to pull (that spear) out, but even then I had to use a great amount of
force to take it out as both its ends were bent.” ‘Urwah said, “Later on,
Allah’s Messenger asked Az-Zubair for the spear and he gave it to him.
When Allah’s Messenger died, Az-Zubair took it back. After that Abu
Bakr demanded it and he gave it to him, and when Abu Bakr died, AzZubair took it back. ‘Umar then demanded it from him and he gave it to
him. When ‘Umar died, Az-Zubair took it back, and then ‘Uthman
demanded it from him and he gave it to him. When ‘Uthman was
martyred, the spear remained with ‘Ali’s offspring. Then ‘Abdullah Ibn
Az-Zubair demanded it back, and it remained with him till he was
martyred.
Ibn Ishaq said: Okkashah Ibn Mihsan , ally of Banu ‘Abd Shams Ibn ‘Abd
Manaf, fought on the day of Badr with his sword until it broke in his hand.
Then he came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, who gave him a piece of wood and said, “O Okkashah, fight
with this!” When he took it from the Messenger of Allah, he shook it and
it turned into a long white hard steel sword in his hand. He fought with it
until Allah granted victory to the Muslims. That sword is known as
Al‘Awn. He witnessed several battles with Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, and it always remained with him, until he
was killed during the wars of apostasy and (the sword) was still with him.
Al-Baihaqi had reported from Al-Hakim that Okkashah Ibn Mihsan
narrated: “My sword broke in the Battle of Badr and Allah’s Messenger
gave me a piece of wood which turned into a long white hard steel sword.
I fought with it until Allah routed the polytheists.” The sword never ceased
to be with him till he died.

The Messenger of Allah’s Restoration of Qatadah’s
Eye
‘Asim Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Qatadah reported from his father, from his
grandfather (Qatadah Ibn An-Nu‘man) that his eye was hit in the Battle
of Badr and its pupil was knocked out from its socket and hung down his
cheek. Some people wanted to cut it off but others restrained them saying:
“Let’s go to Allah’s Messenger to seek his advice.” When they got to him
and narrated to him what happened he went close to Qatadah, raised the
pupil (of the eye) and placed it back into its socket. Then he rubbed the
eye with his palm and prayed: “O Allah, restore it and make it good.” Till
he died, no one who met him was able to identify the eye that was injured.
In another narration, it turned out to be the better of the two eyes. ‘Asim
Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Qatadah rendered a poem chronicling the incident:
I am the son of the one whose pupil (eye) hung down his cheek
Then it was restored by the hand of Al-Mustafa (the Prophet)
Another Narration similar to that:
Al-Baihaqi related from Mu‘adh Ibn Rifa‘ah Ibn Rafi‘ from his father
Rafi‘ Ibn Malik who said: On the day of Badr, the people gathered up to
Ubayy Ibn Khalaf and I approached him and I noticed an opening in his
armor which had broken under his armpit, so I pierced him mortally
through that opening and I was hit by an arrow on the Day of Badr and
my eye was knocked out. The Messenger of Allah placed some of his
saliva on it and supplicated for me and I did not feel any pain from it. This
narration is, however, strange even though its chain is good but he did not
authenticate it.

The Casting of the Leaders of the Kuffar Into the
Well of Badr
Ibn Ishaq related that ‘A’ishah said: When Allah’s Messenger ordered that
the all the corpses (of the Kuffar) be thrown into the pit, they were all
thrown with the exception of Umayyah Ibn Khalaf who had become
41

In The Defence Of the True Faith
swollen in his armor to the extent that it filled it. When they tried to carry
his copse, it disintegrated, so they left it where it was and heaped sand and
stones on his corpse to cover it up.
After they had thrown the corpses into the pit, the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, stood over them and said: “O
people of the pit, you have found true what your Lord had for you, I have
found true what my Lord had promised me.”
‘A’ishah added that his Companions said to him, “O Messenger of Allah,
are you speaking people who are dead?” He said: “They know that what
Allah had promised them is true.” ‘A’ishah continued: The people said
that they had heard what you said to them and the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, merely said: “They have
realized.”
I said, this is from ‘A’ishah’s interpretation of the Hadith as has been
compiled in a section indicating that she considers it to be contradictory
to some Verses of the Qur’an. According to this position, to claim that
she had heard what the Prophet said to them contradicts this Verse: ...but
you cannot make hear those who are in graves. (Soorah Fatir 35:22)
However, there is no contradiction whatsoever; the correct view is that of
the majority of the Companions and those who came after them, that the
said Hadith is a textual proof against her opinion, may Allah be pleased
with her.
Al-Bukhari related that it was mentioned before ‘A’ishah that Ibn ‘Umar
attributed the following statement to the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him: “The dead person is punished in the grave
because of the crying and lamentation of his family.” On that, ‘A’ishah
said, “But Allah’s Messenger said, ‘The dead person is punished for his
crimes and sins while his family cry over him then'.” She added, “And this
is similar to the statement of Allah’s Messenger when he stood by the
(edge of the) well which contained the corpses of the pagans killed at
Badr, ‘They hear what I say.’ She added, “But he said now they know
very well what I used to tell them was the truth.” ‘A’ishah then recited:
Verily, you cannot make the dead to hear. (Soorah An-Naml 27:80) and
42

In The Defence Of the True Faith
...but you cannot make hear those who are in graves. (Soorah Fatir 35:22)
that is, when they have taken their places in the (Hell)Fire.
The possibility of the dead hearing after being buried has been
categorically established by more than one Hadith as shall be clarified in
the Book Al-Jana’iz Min Ahkam Al-Kabeer by the permission of Allah.
Al-Bukhari related that Ibn ‘Umar said: “The Prophet stood at the well of
Badr (which contained the corpses of the pagans) and said, “Have you
found true what your lord promised you?” Then he further said, “They
now hear what I say to them.” This was mentioned before ‘A’ishah and
she said, “But the Prophet said, ‘Now they know very well that what I
used to tell them was the truth.’ Then she recited: Verily, you cannot make
the dead to hear, ... till the end of Verse. (Soorah An-Naml 27:80)
Al-Bukhari related that Abu Talhah narrated that on the day of Badr,
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered
that the corpses of twenty-four leaders of Quraish be thrown into one of
the dirty dry wells of Badr. (It was a habit of the Prophet that whenever
he conquered some people, he used to stay at the battlefield for three
nights.) So, on the third day of the Battle of Badr, he ordered that his shecamel be saddled, then he set out, and his Companions followed him
saying among themselves: “Definitely he (i.e. the Prophet) is proceeding
for some great purpose.” When he halted at the edge of the well, he
addressed the corpses of the Quraish infidels by their names and their
fathers’ names, “O so-and-so, son of so-and-so; and O so-and-so, son of
so-and-so! Would it have pleased you if you had obeyed Allah and His
Messenger? We have found true what our Lord promised us. Have you
too found true what your Lord promised you?” ‘Umar said, “O Allah’s
Messenger! You are speaking to bodies that have no souls!” Allah’s
Messenger said, “By Him in Whose Hands is Muhammad’s soul, you do
not hear what I say better than they do.” (Qatadah said, “Allah brought
them to life (again) to let them hear him, to reprimand them and slight
them, and to take revenge over them and to cause them to feel remorseful
and regretful.”)
Ibn Ishaq related that when the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, commanded that they (the corpse of the polytheists)
43

In The Defence Of the True Faith
be thrown into the pit, the corpse of ‘Utbah Ibn Rabee‘ah was dragged
and thrown in the Qaleeb (the well) at Badr. Abu Hudhaifah stared at his
father’s corpse with a changed complexion. When the Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, saw him, he said: “Abu Hudhaifah,
perhaps you are nursing some feelings regarding your father?” “No, O
Messenger of Allah, I do not have any doubt about my father’s death nor
about where he is going; rather, I had always known my father of having
the qualities of intelligence, insight and grace, and I had hoped that these
qualities will guide him to Islam. When I saw the fate that eventually
befell him then I called to mind the polytheism upon which he died and
the hope I had always nursed for him and that really saddened me.” Then
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, prayed for
him and said good things about him.
Al-Bukhari related that Ibn ‘Abbas said concerning the Verse: “Have you
not seen those who have changed the Blessings of Allah into disbelief (by
denying Prophet Muhammad and his Message of Islam)…” (Soorah
Ibrahim 14:28) the people meant here by Allah are the pagans of Quraish
and Muhammad is Allah’s blessings. Concerning the statement: “…and
have caused their people to dwell in the house of destruction?” Ibn ‘Abbas
said: “It meant the Fire they will suffer in (after their death) on the day of
Badr.”
Imam Ahmad related that Ibn ‘Abbas said: “When Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was through with the corpses,
it was said to him: ‘Take to ‘Al-‘Eer’, nothing lies before it.” Then ‘Abbas
called on to him while he was in fetters: “It will not be permissible for
you.” “Why?” the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, asked. ‘Abbas replied: “Because Allah promised you one of
two groups and He has fulfilled what He has promised you.”
Allah had legalized the fighting of the Muslims against the disbelievers
and had explained its wisdom in this regard. So, when you meet (in fight
Jihad in Allah’s Cause), those who disbelieve smite at their necks till when
you have killed and wounded many of them, then bind a bond firmly (on
them, i.e. take them as captives). Thereafter (is the time) either for
generosity (i.e. free them without ransom), or ransom
44

In The Defence Of the True Faith
(according to what benefits Islam), until the war lays down its burden.
Thus [you are ordered by Allah to continue in carrying out Jihad against
the disbelievers till they embrace Islam (i.e. are saved from the
punishment in the Hellfire) or at least come under your protection], but if
it had been Allah’s Will, He Himself could certainly have punished them
(without you). But (He lets you fight), in order to test you, some with
others. (Soorah Muhammad 47:4)
Allah (SWT) also says: Fight against them so that Allah will punish them
by your hands and disgrace them and give you victory over them and heal
the breasts of a believing people, And remove the anger of their
(believers’) hearts. Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills. Allah
is All-Knowing, All-Wise. (Soorah At-Tawbah 9:14,15)
Abu Jahl was killed by the hands of a youth from the Ansar and afterwards
‘Abdullah Ibn Mas‘ood came upon him, decapitated him and brought his
head to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him.
Allah gladdened the heart of the Muslims because this kind of death is
more humiliating than a thunder bolting striking him, or the roof of his
house collapsing on him, or him dying naturally.
Ibn Ishaq related that among those who were killed along with the
polytheists on the day of Badr were those who came to the battlefield out
of dissimulation and a number of them had been tortured to abandon
Islam. Among them were Al-Harith Ibn Zam‘ah Ibn Al-Aswad, Abu Qais
Ibn Al-Fakih, Abu Qais Ibn AlWaleed Ibn Al-Mugheerah, ‘Ali Ibn
Umayyah Ibn Khalaf and Al-‘As Ibn Munabbah Ibn Al-Hajjaj.
It is concerning them that this Verse was revealed: Verily! As for those
whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as
they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was
obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): “In what (condition)
were you?” They reply: “We were weak and oppressed on earth.” They
(angels) say: “Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to
emigrate therein?” Such men will find their abode in Hell - What an evil
destination! (Soorah An-Nisa’
4:97)
45

In The Defence Of the True Faith
The number of those who were captured on the day of Badr was seventy,
as shall be discussed shortly, insha'Allah. Among them were members of
the family of Allah’s Messenger – his uncle, Al-‘Abbas Ibn ‘AbdulMuttalib, his cousin Aqeel Ibn Abi Talib, Nawfal Ibn Al-Harith Ibn
‘Abdul-Muttalib. Imam AshShafi‘i, Al-Bukhari and others have adduced
from this the evidence that not everyone who had some relationship and
was captured was forbidden to be liberated. They cited the Hadith of AlHasan from Samurah regarding that. And Allah knows best. Among this
group was Abul-‘As Ibn Ar-Rabee‘ Ibn ‘Abd Shams Ibn Umayyah, the
husband of Zainab, who was the daughter of the Prophet.
The Companions’ view were divided over the fate of the captives – should
they be killed or ransomed? Al-Hasan said: The Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, sought the advice of the
Muslims concerning the captives of Badr. He said: “Allah has given you
power over them.” ‘Umar rose and said: “O Messenger of Allah, chop off
their necks.” The Prophet turned away from him. The Prophet again
turned to the people for another advice. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq got up and
said: “O Messenger of Allah, our view is that you should forgive them
and accept their ransom.” Then, the gloom on the face of Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was dissipated and
he forgave them and accepted their ransom. Then Allah revealed: Were it
not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have
touched you for what you took. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:68) This Hadith is
exclusively related by Ahmad.
Ibn ‘Umar narrated that when the Kuffar were captured on the day of Badr,
‘Abbas was among them; he was captured by one of the Ansar men. The
Ansar had threatened to kill him and when that got to the Prophet, he said:
“I could not sleep overnight owing to anxiety over my uncle I thought the
Ansar had killed him.” ‘Umar said: “Should I approach them?” and the
Prophet answered in the affirmative. So ‘Umar approached the Ansar and
said to them: “Release ‘Abbas.” They said: “By Allah we shall not release
him.” ‘Umar said: “Even if that is pleasing to the Messenger of Allah?”
The Ansar said: “If that pleases him, then you may take him.” When
‘Umar took him, he said to ‘Abbas: “O ‘Abbas, accept Islam. By Allah,
your acceptance of Islam is more pleasing to me than that of Al-Khattab
and that is not so except owing to the fact your acceptance of Islam will
46

In The Defence Of the True Faith
delight the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him.
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
sought Abu Bakr’s advice and he said: “They are your relatives, so release
them.” He sought ‘Umar’s advice and he said: “Kill them.” Eventually,
the Prophet accepted their ransom and Allah revealed: It is not for a
Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom)
until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land.
(Soorah Al-Anfal 8:67)
Al-Mujahid and Ath-Thawree said concerning Allah’s statement: Were it
not a previous ordainment from Allah. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:68) it means
ordainment of forgiveness.
Al-Walibee related that Ibn ‘Abbas said: It is recorded in the first Umm
Al-Kitab that the booty and ransom of the captives of Badr are permissible
for them. This is why Allah says thereafter: So enjoy what you have gotten
of booty in war, lawful and good… (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:69)
This has also been related from Abu Hurairah, Ibn Mas‘ood, Ibn Jubair,
‘Ata’, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, AlA‘amash and it is also the preferred opinion
of Ibn Jareer. This preference for this view is corroborated by what is
recorded in the Saheehain from Jabi Ibn ‘Abdullah that Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“I have been given five things which were not given to any amongst the
Prophets before me. (They are):
Allah made me victorious by awe (by His frightening my enemies) for a
distance of one month’s journey.
The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for
praying and a thing to perform
Tayammum. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me (and was
not made so for anyone else). I have been given the right of intercession
(on the Day of Resurrection). Every Prophet used to be sent to his
nation exclusively but I have been sent to all mankind.”
Al-A‘mash related from Abu Saleh that Abu Hurairah narrated that the
Prophet said: “War booty was not permitted other than for us.” This is
why Allah said: So enjoy what you have gotten of booty in war, lawful
47

In The Defence Of the True Faith
and good... (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:69) Thus Allah permitted the consumption
of war booties and ransom of war captives.
Abu Dawood had related that Ibn ‘Abbas narrated that Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, fixed the ransom of the captives
of the Battle of Badr at four hundred. That was the least amount of ransom
taken from anyone of them. The highest amount taken from one person
was four thousand dirham.
Ibn Ishaq related that Ibn ‘Abbas said: “All the while the captives
remained in bondage; the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, would spend the night awake. When he was asked
why he could not sleep, he said, ‘I can hear the plaintive moaning of my
uncle in captivity.’ When he was unfettered, ‘Abbas became quiet and the
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was able to sleep.
Ibn Ishaq added: He was a wealthy man, so he ransomed himself with one
hundred uqiyyah of gold.
I say: The hundred uqiyyah of gold was paid on behalf of himself, his two
nephews – ‘Aqeel and Nawfal and his ally, ‘Utbah Ibn ‘Amr, one of the
Banu Al-Harith Ibn Fihr as Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, had ordered when he claimed that he had accepted
Islam. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said to him: “We will deal only with what is apparent from you and only
Allah knows best the fact of your acceptance of Islam and He will reward
you accordingly.” He claimed he had no money with him. The Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to him: “Where
is the money both you and Umm Fadl buried and you said to him: ‘If I am
killed in this journey, this money is meant for Banu Fadl, ‘Abdullah and
Qutham’?” He said: “By Allah, I know you are truly a Messenger of Allah
for this matter known to no one other than myself and Umm Fadl.”
Related by Ibn Ishaq from Ibn Abi Najeeh from ‘Ata’ from Ibn ‘Abbas.
Anas Ibn Malik narrated that: Some Ansari men asked permission from
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saying,
“Allow us not to take the ransom of our nephew ‘Abbas.” The Prophet
replied, “Do not leave a single dirham from it.”
48

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Bukhari related that Anas narrated that some money from Bahrain was
brought to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him. He said, “Spread it in the Mosque.” It was the biggest amount that
had ever been brought to Allah’s Messenger. In the meantime, ‘Abbas
came to him and said, “O Allah’s Messenger! Give me, for I gave the
ransom of myself and ‘Aqeel.” The Prophet said (to him), “Take.” He
scooped money with both hands and poured it in his garment and tried to
lift it, but he could not and appealed to the Prophet, “Will you order
someone to help me in lifting it?” The Prophet said, “No.” Then ‘Abbas
said, “Then will you yourself help me carry it?” The Prophet said, “No.”
Then ‘Abbas threw away some of the money, but even then he was not
able to lift it, and so he again requested the Prophet “Will you order
someone to help me carry it?” The Prophet said, “No.” Then ‘Abbas said,
“Then will you yourself help me carry it?” The Prophet said, “No.” So,
‘Abbas threw away some more money and lifted it on his shoulder and
went away. The Prophet kept on looking at him with astonishment at his
greediness till he went out of our sight. Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, did not get up from there till not a single
dirham remained from that money.

The Number of Captives and Those Killed Among the
Polytheists in the Battle of Badr
It is popularly known that the number of captives from Badr were seventy
and the number of the dead Mushrikeen was also seventy as related by
other narrations separate from those related earlier, such as the Hadith of
Al-Bara’ Ibn ‘Azib in Saheeh Al-Bukhari that the Muslims killed seventy
and captured seventy.
Al-Baihaqi said that Al-Bara’ Ibn ‘Azib narrated that: Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, appointed ‘Abdullah Ibn Jubair
over the archers on the day of the Battle of Badr and seventy of us were
felled (i.e. at the Battle of Uhud). Meanwhile, the Prophet and his
Companions had recorded 140 of the Mushrikeen as casualty of the Battle
of Badr. Seventy were captured and seventy were killed.
I say: The aggregate of the Mushrikeen at the battle was between nine
hundred and one thousand. Qatadah was categorical that they were nine
49

In The Defence Of the True Faith
hundred and fifty men and perhaps he took the information from what we
have mentioned and Allah knows best. In the Hadith of ‘Umar mentioned
earlier, there number was a little more than one thousand. The more
authentic of the views is the first one based on what the Prophet said: “The
number of the people (enemies) was between nine hundred and one
thousand.” As for the number of the Companions on that day, they were
about three hundred and ten men.

How the Booty Was Shared
The Companions disagreed on the day of Battle of Badr over the booty
taken from the Mushrikeen over what should rightly be theirs. The
Companions were broken into three groups after the Mushrikeen fled. A
group encircled the Messenger of Allah lest anyone from the Mushrikeen
would return to harm him.
Another group pursued the Mushrikeen killing and capturing some of
them while the third group went around gathering the spoils of war from
different parts of the battle field. Each group claimed to have greater right
due to the gravity of their exploits.
Ibn Ishaq related that Abu Umamah Al-Bahili said: I asked Ubadah Ibn
Samit about "Al-Anfal" (a chapter of the Qur’an) and he said: “It was
revealed concerning us the participants of the Battle of Badr when we
disagreed over the booty. When our disagreement became aggravated,
Allah took it from us and made it the prerogative of the Messenger of
Allah to distribute it among the believers equally.” The meaning of his
statement “equally” is that equal portion was given to those who gathered
the booty and those who pursued the enemies as well as those who
remained under the flags; he did not give preference to anyone who
claimed precedence in its portion. This did not, however, nullify the onefifth so it was disposed of accordingly as some scholars have
misconstrued among whom were Abu ‘Ubaidah and others. And Allah
knows best. Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
obtained a sword with a spine as his portion from the spoils of the Battle
of Badr.
‘Ubadah Ibn Samit narrated: We went out with the Prophet and I
witnessed the Battle of Badr with him. We met the enemy and Allah
50

In The Defence Of the True Faith
routed them. A group chased after the enemy decimating and capturing
them and another group fell upon the spoils picking and gathering them
while the third group encircled the Messenger of Allah lest the enemy
should unexpectedly attack him. This continued till nightfall when the
people gathered again. Those who had gathered the spoils claimed sole
right to what they had gathered and that no one would else would have
any portion in it. Those who chased after the enemy disagreed with them
claiming that they had no greater share to the spoils than them for they
were the ones who pursued the enemy causing them to abandon the spoils,
and they were the ones who routed them. Those who encircled the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: We
feared that the enemy would carry out a surprise attack on him (i.e. the
Prophet) so we were busy protecting him.
Thus Allah (SWT) revealed: They ask you (O Muhammad) about the
spoils of war. Say: “The spoils are for Allah and the Messenger.” So fear
Allah and adjust all matters of difference among you, and obey Allah and
His Messenger (Muhammad), if you are believers. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:1)
Thus, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
distributed it equally among the Muslims. Whenever the Messenger of
Allah invaded an enemy land, he would give out one-fourth of the booty
and one-third upon his return and he used to dislike the spoils of war.
Abu Dawood, An-Nasa’i, Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim have related through
different chains that Ibn ‘Abbas narrated: Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said on the day of the Battle of Badr,
“Whoever does such-and-such, for him will be such-and-such reward.”
The young men dashed forth in quest of that while the elderly ones
remained close to the flags. When Allah bestowed victory on them, the
elderly men said: “We were a support for you. If you had been defeated,
you would have returned to us. Do not take this booty alone and we remain
(deprived of it).” The young men refused (to give), and said: The
Messenger of Allah has given it to us. Then Allah revealed: They ask you
(O Muhammad) about the spoils of war. Say: “The spoils are for Allah
and the Messenger.” So fear Allah and adjust all matters of difference
among you, and obey Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad), if you are
believers. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:1)
51

In The Defence Of the True Faith
The importance of all that is that the matter of the spoils of war is referred
to the ruling of Allah (SWT) and His Messenger based on the overriding
benefits of the servants (of Allah) in their livelihood and hereafter. Thus
Allah revealed: They ask you (O Muhammad) about the spoils of war.
Say: “The spoils are for Allah and the Messenger.” So fear Allah and
adjust all matters of difference among you, and obey Allah and His
Messenger (Muhammad), if you are believers. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:1)
Then he related the events of the Battle of Badr and what transpired till he
ended with the words of Allah: And know that whatever of war booty that
you may gain, verily one-fifth (1/5th) of it is assigned to Allah, and to the
Messenger, and to the near relatives [of the Messenger (Muhammad)],
(and also) the orphans, Al-Masakeen (the poor) and the wayfarer. (Soorah
Al-Anfal 8:41)
Clearly, this verse explains the ruling of Allah on the spoils of war, which
He attributed to Himself and His Messenger and explained and ruled on it
as He deemed.

The Prophet’s Return From Badr to Madinah
It is recorded in the Saheehain that whenever the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was victorious in a battle, he
would stay at an open field close to the battlefield for three days. The
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, had stayed
at the open field of Badr for three days as mentioned earlier. His departure
was on Monday night. He rode his camel and stopped by the well of Badr
and rebuked those who were hauled into it, as related earlier. Then the
Messenger of Allah departed along with the captives and a great amount
of spoils from the war. Meanwhile, Allah’s Messenger, peace be upon
him, had sent ahead of him two men to carry the news of his victory over
those who associate partners with Allah and belie Him. He sent ‘Abdullah
Ibn Rawahah to the upper part of Madinah and Zaid Ibn Harithah to the
lower part of the city.
Usamah Ibn Zaid related that the Prophet left behind ‘Uthman and
Usamah Ibn Zaid to attend to the daughter of the Messenger of Allah. Zaid
Ibn Harithah came riding Adba’, the camel of the Messenger of Allah with
52

In The Defence Of the True Faith
news of the victory. Usamah said: I heard the hue and cry, so I came out
to see that Zaid had come with the glad tiding and, by Allah, I did not
believe it until we saw the captives and Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, gave ‘Uthman his portion (of the spoils).”
Ibn Ishaq related: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, returned
to his home along with the captives, among whom were ‘Uqbah Ibn Abi
Mu’ait and Nadra Ibn Al-Harith. He had entrusted the spoils of war to
‘Abdullah Ibn Ka‘b Ibn ‘Amr Ibn ‘Awf Ibn Mabdhool Ibn ‘Amr Ibn
Ghanm Ibn Mazin Ibn AnNajjar.
Then the Messenger of Allah continued his return journey till he passed
through the strait of As-Safra’. He descended upon the sand dune known
as Siyar Kunayb situated between the strait and the oasis of AnNaziyah
by a tree located close by, where he distributed equally the spoils of war,
which Allah had bestowed on the Muslims from the disbelievers.
Afterwards, he proceeded until he reached Ar-Raha’ where he was met by
some Muslims who had gathered to congratulate him, and those who were
present with him, for the victory that Allah bestowed on him. Salamah Ibn
Salamah Ibn Waqsh, as related to me by ‘Asim Ibn ‘Umar and Yazeed Ibn
Roomaan, said: “Why are you congratulating us? By Allah, we merely
confronted decrepit people whom we found like a tethered camel that we
slaughtered.” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, smiled and then said: “O my nephew, they were a multitude.”

The Killing of An-Nadr Ibn Al-Harith and ‘Uqbah
Ibn Abi Mu‘ait
Ibn Ishaq related: When the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,
reached As-Safra’ he ordered that An-Nadr Ibn Al-Harith be executed and
‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib killed him as related to me by some men of knowledge
among the people of Makkah. Thereafter, he proceeded till he was at Irq
Uz-Zubyah where he ordered that ‘Uqbah Ibn Abi Mu‘ait be executed as
well.
Ash-Sha‘bi related that when the Prophet ordered the execution of ‘Uqbah
he said: “Would you kill me from all of Quraish?” He replied: “Yes, do
53

In The Defence Of the True Faith
you know what this one had done to me? He came while I was in
prostration behind the Maqam (Ibrahim) and he placed his leg on my neck
and pressed down on it and I was unable to raise my head till I thought
my eyes would be affected. He came at another time with the bowels of a
goat and placed it on my head while I was in prostration and Fatimah came
to remove it off my head.” Ibn Hisham said: Rather, it is reported by AzZuhri and other people of knowledge that it was ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib who
killed ‘Uqbah.
I say: These two men more than any others were vehement in their
disbelief, obstinacy, transgression, envy, lampooning Islam and its
adherents. May Allah curse them both.

The Joy of Najashi at the Event of Badr
Al-Hafiz Al-Baihaqi related from ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn Yazeed Ibn Jabir
from ‘Abdur-Rahman, a man from Sana‘ who narrated that one day, AnNajashi sent for Ja‘afar Ibn Abi Talib and his compatriots and they came
to meet him in a house while he was wearing a worn-out cloth and sitting
on bare sand. Ja‘afar said: We were scared when we saw him in that
condition. When he noticed our expression, he said, I want to break to you
news that will be pleasing to you. One of my spies has come to me from
your land with information that Allah has given victory to His Prophet
and has destroyed his enemy and such-and-such persons have been
captured and such-and-such persons have been killed. They had met at a
valley called Badr which is suffused with Arak as if I can see it now
because I used to graze camels on behalf of my master who was a man
from Banu Damrah. Ja‘afar asked him: Then why are you sitting on bare
sand without any rug and wearing this sort of dress? He said: We found
in what Allah has sent down upon ‘Eesa that it is a right upon the slave of
Allah to demonstrate gratitude to Allah in humility whenever He granted
them a favor. So when Allah granted me the favor of the victory of His
Prophet, I am presenting to Him this humility as gratitude.”

In The Defence Of the True Faith

The News of the Casualties of Badr Reaches Their
Families in Makkah
Ibn Ishaq related: The first person to reach Makkah with the news of the
casualty of Badr was AlHaithuman Ibn ‘Abdullah Al-Khuza‘i. They asked
him: “What course of event did you leave behind?” He replied: “ ‘Utbah
Ibn Rabee‘ah was killed and so were Shaibah Ibn Rabee‘ah, Abul-Hakam
Ibn Hisham, Umayyah Ibn Khalaf, Zam‘ah Ibn Al-Aswad, Nabeeh and
Munabbih, and Abul-Bakhatari Ibn Hisham.” When he continued to
enumerate the fate of the noblemen of Quraish, Safwan Ibn Umayyah
said: “I cannot fathom this, so ask him on my behalf.” They said: “What
has Safwan Ibn Umayyah done?” He said: “There he is sitting in the hijr.
By Allah, I saw his father and brother when they were killed.”
Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah said that when the news reached the people of Makkah,
after verifying it, the women tore their hair in grief and there were lots of
wailing.
Ibn Ishaq added: Yahya Ibn ‘Abbad narrated to me from his father who
said, they mourned their dead from the battle and some of them said: “Stop
mourning, so that Muhammad may not rejoice at your misfortune when
the news of your mourning reaches him, and do not hasten to seek the
return of your captives until they become amenable so that Muhammad
may not become too strict in ransom.”
I say: This is a complete punishment from Allah for them, because they
abandoned the mourning of their dead, even though weeping over the dead
is something that dispels grief from the heart.
Ibn Ishaq related that Al-Aswad Ibn Al-Muttalib lost three of his children,
Zam‘ah, ‘Aqeel and Al-Harith. He desired to cry over the loss of his
children. While he was still in grief, he heard a shriek in the middle of the
night and he said to a boy of his, as he had lost his sight: “Check if what
we desire has been permitted. Has the Quraish decided to weep over their
dead? So that I may also weep over Hakeemah (i.e. his son Zam‘ah) for
my inside has been incinerated with grief.” When the slave boy returned,
he informed him that it was just a woman crying over her lost camel.
55

In The Defence Of the True Faith

The Sending of Emissaries by the Quraish so as to
Ransom their Prisoners
Ibn Ishaq related that among the captives was Abu Wada‘ah Ibn Dubairah
As-Sahmi, so the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said: “He has a son back in Makkah who is a shrewd and rich
trader and it seems he will soon come to ransom his father.”
When the Quraish said to not hasten in getting your captives ransomed so
that Muhammad and his Companions do not become extreme in regards
to their asking amount, Al-Muttalib Ibn Abi Wada‘ah, the one about
whom the Messenger of Allah. peace be upon him, said: “You are correct,
do not be in haste,” snuck out at night and headed for Madinah. When he
got there, he ransomed his father with four thousand dirham and took him
away.
I say: This was the first prisoner of the Battle of Badr to be ransomed.
Afterwards, the Quraish sent emissaries seeking to ransom their prisoners.
Makraz Ibn Hafs Ibn Al-Akhyaf also arrived to pay the ransom of Suhail
Ibn ‘Amr.
Ibn Ishaq related that ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said to Allah’s Messenger,
peace be upon him: “Allow me to pluck out the front teeth of Suhail Ibn
‘Amr to let his tongue stick out so that he will never again be able to speak
against you in public.” Allah’s Messenger replied: “No, I shall not torture
him so that Allah may not also torture me even though I am a Prophet.”
I say: This Hadith is mursal; rather, it is mu’dal.
Ibn Ishaq related: It has reached me that Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said to ‘Umar concerning his request to
punish Suhail severely: “Perhaps he will stand in a position for which you
will not censure him.”
I say: This is in reference to his standing in Makkah when the Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, died and some Arabs
apostatized and hypocrisy reared its head in Madinah and other places.
56

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Suhail rose in Makkah to address the people and strengthen them upon the
deen of Al-Haneef (Islam) as shall be elaborated on later.
Ibn Ishaq said: ‘Abdullah Ibn Abi Bakr narrated: It was said to Abu
Sufyan, “Ransom ‘Amr, your son.” He replied, “Should I add my wealth
to my blood? They killed Hanzalah and will I pay ransom for ‘Amr? Leave
him in their hands, let them do as they like with him.” While his son was
still in captivity in Madinah, Sa‘d Ibn An-Nu‘man Ibn Ukal, the brother
of Banu ‘Amr Ibn ‘Awf and one of the Banu Mu‘awiyyah went out with
the intention of performing ‘Umrah (in Makkah). He was an old Muslim
man who used to tend his livestock by the Baqee‘. So he departed from
there for ‘Umrah without any fear of what might be done to him. He did
not entertain the thought of being detained in Makkah. He had merely
come for ‘Umrah, and the Quraish had previously given their words that
they will not intercept anyone who comes to them with the intention of
Hajj or ‘Umrah. However, while in Makkah, Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb
transgressed against him, and detained him in retaliation for his son, ‘Amr.
Banu ‘Amr Ibn ‘Awf went to inform Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, of the incident and they requested him to
hand over ‘Amr Ibn Abi Sufyan so as to exchange him with their own
compatriot. The Prophet acceded to their request and they sent ‘Amr to
Abu Sufyan and he also freed Sa‘d.
Ibn Ishaq related that ‘A’ishah said that when the Quraish sent emissaries
to ransom their prisoners, Zainab sent money to ransom her husband,
Abul-‘As. The money included a necklace which Khadeejah (her mother)
had given her on the occasion of her marriage. When the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saw the necklace, he
became emotional and said (to his Companions): “If you wish to free her
prisoner and return her money, then do so.” The Companions accepted
this and did as the Messenger of Allah wished.
Ibn Ishaq also related: Abu Azzah 'Amr Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Uthman Ibn
Uhaib Ibn Hudhafah Ibn Jamuh (one of the prisoners) was a poor man
with daughters to care for; so he said: O Messenger of Allah, you are
aware of my condition with regard to wealth. I am a needy person with
families to care for, so please be kind to me.” Allah’s Messenger showed
57

In The Defence Of the True Faith
mercy to him and he took a covenant from him to never aid anyone against
him. Abu Azzah said in praise of Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him:
Who will inform Muhammad on my behalf
That you are indeed truthful and a noble holder
And that you are one who invites to the truth and guidance
You have a witness from Allah, the Almighty
You were built among us like a residence
Having many levels whose climbing is easy
Whoever you wage war against is unfortunate
And whoever you make peace with is fortunate
When I remember Badr and its people
My portion of sorrow and omission come back
I say: This Abu ‘Azzah would later annul the covenant he had with
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. The
Mushrikeen played on his intelligence and he returned to them. On the
day of the Battle of Uhud, he was again captured. He once more begged
the Messenger of Allah for clemency and the Prophet said: “I will not let
you go, for you will turn your cheek and say that you fooled Muhammad
twice.” He then ordered that he be executed, which was carried out as shall
be related in the story of the Battle of Uhud. It is also said that it is on this
occasion that the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: “A
Muslim is not stung twice from the same hole.” These kinds of words are
not heard elsewhere except from him.
Ibn Ishaq related that ‘Urwah Ibn Az-Zubair related that ‘Umair Ibn Wahb
Al-Jumahi sat with Safwan Ibn Umayyah in the hijr shortly after the
debacle of Badr. ‘Umair Ibn Wahb was one of the vilest of Quraish and
58

In The Defence Of the True Faith
one of those who used to hurt the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, and his Companions. They used to experience
trouble from him while in Makkah. However, his son, Wahb Ibn ‘Umair
was among the prisoners of Badr. Ibn Hisham added: the one who
captured him was Rifa‘ah Ibn Rafi‘ from the Banu Zuraiq.
Ibn Ishaq related that Muhammad Ibn Ja‘afar narrated to me from ‘Urwah
(that ‘Umair Ibn Wahb and Safwan) recounted the people thrown into the
pit and other casualties of theirs, so Safwan said: “By Allah, there will not
be any value in living after them.” ‘Umair concurred saying: “You are
correct, by Allah, were it not for the repayment of the loan of ‘Ali, which
I am incapable of repaying and my family for which I have some fears
after I am gone, I would ride to Muhammad till I am able to kill him
because my son is in his captivity.” Safwan Ibn Umayyah seized that
opportunity and said to him: “I take responsibility for the repayment of
your loan and I shall merge your family with mine in their care, no harm
will come to them.” ‘Umair said: “Then keep this matter between both of
us.” He replied: “I shall do that.” Then ‘Umair called for his sword,
sharpened it and laced it with poison. Thereafter, he proceeded till he
arrived in Madinah.
Meanwhile, ‘Umar was in the midst of a group of Muslims discussing the
event of Badr and recollecting how Allah had ennobled them with it and
what they had seen in their enemies. Just then, ‘Umar saw ‘Umair Ibn
Wahb as he perched by the entrance of the mosque with a drawn sword
and said: “This is the dog, enemy of Allah, ‘Umair Ibn Wahb. Nothing
has brought him here except an evil intent. He is the same person who
sowed discord among us and gave the estimate of our strength to the
enemies on the day of Badr.” Then he went in to inform the Messenger of
Allah. “O Prophet of Allah,” he said, “ ‘Umair Ibn Wahb, the enemy of
Allah, has come with a drawn sword.” The Prophet said: “Let him in.”
‘Umar went back, wrapped the strap of his sword to his neck, and he said
to those present among the Ansar: “All of you go in and sit with the
Prophet and protect him against this filth for he is not to be trusted.” ‘Umar
led him in to meet the Messenger of Allah. When he saw how ‘Umar had
wound the strap of his sword round ‘Umair’s neck, he said: “Release him,
‘Umar. Come closer, ‘Umair.” He moved close to the Prophet and said:
“Good morning,” which was a greeting of the time of Jahiliyyah. The
59

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, said: “Allah has ennobled us with
a better form of greeting than yours. ‘Umair, the greeting of peace will be
the greeting of the inmates of Paradise.” Then the Prophet asked: “What
has brought you, ‘Umair?” He replied: “I have come regarding this
prisoner that you have with you to seek your benevolence on his matter.”
“Then what about the sword on your neck?” the Messenger of Allah poked
further. ‘Umair said: “Cursed be the swords, has they benefited (us) in any
way?” “Tell me the truth, what has brought you?” the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, insisted. Again, ‘Umair
maintained: “Nothing has brought me other than what I had told you.”
Finally, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said: “No, rather, you sat in the hijr with Safwan Ibn Umayyah and
you both lamented your loss and remembering the Quraishi inmates of the
pit (of Badr) and then you said: ‘Had it not been for my debt and my
family I would have proceeded to kill Muhammad, and Safwan offered to
repay your debt and take care of your family upon the promise of killing
me and Allah put a wedge between you and your goal.”
Obviously flabbergasted, ‘Umair said: “I bear witness that truly you are a
Messenger of Allah. We used to belie what you used to bring from the
Divine information and revelation. As for this issue, no other person had
witnessed it except me and Safwan. By Allah, I know no one has brought
this information to you except Allah. So I thank Allah Who has guided
me to Islam and made me tread this course.” Then he bore the witness of
Truth (i.e. he accepted Islam).
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Teach your brother his religion. Teach him the Qur’an and release his
prisoner to him.” The Companions did as the Prophet ordered. Thereafter,
he said: “O Allah’s Messenger, I used to make strenuous efforts to
extinguish the Light of Allah and to persecute those who were upon the
religion of Allah. I wish you would permit me to go back to Makkah so
that I may invite them to Allah and His Messenger as well as to Islam.
Perhaps Allah will guide them or, at least, they may also persecute me the
way I used to persecute your Companions over their religion.” The
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, permitted
him and he went back to Makkah.
60

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Meanwhile, after ‘Umair had left for Madinah, Safwan would tell the
people: “I give you glad tidings of an impending incident that will make
you forget the debacle of Badr. Safwan kept asking every rider arriving in
Makkah for information about ‘Umair until a rider came and informed
him that ‘Umair had accepted Islam. He swore never to speak with ‘Umair
again and to have anything to do with him again.
Ibn Ishaq continued: When ‘Umair arrived in Makkah, he began calling
people to Islam and many people accepted Islam at his hands. ‘Umair
Ibn Wahb or Al-Haarith Ibn Hisham was the one who saw the enemy of
Allah, Iblees, when he turned on his heels on the day of Badr saying: “ I
have nothing to do with you. I see what you do not.” On that day, Iblees
took the form of Suraqah Ibn Malik Ibn Ju‘shum.
Then Ibn Ishaq began to mention the names of the Muslims who were
martyred in the Battle of Badr. First, he enumerated the names of those
who witnessed it among the emigrants followed by those of the Ansar
from the Aws and the Khazraj. Finally, Ibn Ishaq said: The aggregate of
those who witnessed the Battle of Badr among the emigrant Muslims and
the Ansar as well as those who were rewarded and given a share in the
booty numbered three hundred and fourteen men. Eighty-three were from
the Emigrants, sixty-one from the Aws and one hundred and seventy men
from the Khazraj. Al-Bukhari has also enumerated them in his Saheeh in
alphabetical order after the names of Allah’s Messenger, Abu Bakr,
‘Umar, ‘Uthman and ‘Ali. May Allah be pleased with them all.

The Excellence of Those Who Participated in the
Battle of Badr
Al-Bukhari related from Humayd that he heard Anas say: Harithah was
killed in the Battle of Badr, so his mother came to the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and said: “O Allah’s
Messenger! Inform me about Harithah. If he is in Paradise, I shall remain
patient, but if it is not so, then you shall see what I do (i.e. of wailing)?”
Allah’s Messenger said to her: “Woe to you! Have you lost your senses?
Do you think Paradise is only one (level)? It has many wonderful gardens
and your son is in the (most superior) garden of Paradise, Al-Firdaus.”
61

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Bukhari and Muslim both related from ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib the story of
Hatib Ibn Abi Balta’ah and his sending of a letter to the people of Makkah
in the year of the conquest. ‘Umar sought the permission of the Messenger
of Allah to behead him for he had betrayed Allah, His Messenger and the
Believers. In response, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said: “He participated in the Battle of Badr and who
knows, perhaps Allah has already looked at the Badr warriors and said,
‘Do whatever you like, for I have forgiven you’.” ‘Umar’s eyes welled
with tears and he said: “Allah and His Messenger know best.”
Imam Muslim related that Jabir narrated that a slave of Hatib came to the
Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, complaining against him, then
he said: “O Messenger of Allah, Hatib will definitely enter the Fire.”
Whereupon the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said: “You have lied, he will never enter it for he participated in the
Battle of Badr and Al-Hudaibiyyah.”
Imam Ahmad related from Abu Hurairah that the Prophet said: “Allah
looked at the warriors of Badr and said, ‘Do whatever you like, for I have
forgiven you’.” Abu Dawood has also related it from Ahmad Ibn Sinan
and Moosa Ibn Ismael, both of whom related it from Yazeed Ibn Haaroon.
Al-Bukhari related that Mu‘adh Ibn Rifa‘ah Ibn Rafi‘ Az-Zuraqi narrated
that his father, who was one of those who witnessed the Battle of Badr,
said: “Jibraeel came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, and said, “How do you look upon the warriors of Badr
among yourselves?” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said, “As the best of the Muslims,” or said a similar
statement. On that, Jibraeel said, “And so are the angels who participated
in Badr.” Al-Bukhari reported it exclusively.

The Arrival of Zainab, the Daughter of Allah’s
Messenger, from Makkah to Madinah, a Month After
Badr
After Abul-‘As was freed, he returned to Makkah. Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, sent Zaid Ibn Harithah and
commanded both of them to remain in Ya’jaj till Zainab would pass by
62

In The Defence Of the True Faith
them and then accompany her back to me in Madinah. Both of them went
as commanded and this incident occurred a month or thereabout after the
Battle of Badr. When Al-‘As arrived in Makkah, he ordered her to join
her father (in Madinah) and she left after a short while.
Al-Baihaqi has related in Ad-Dala’il from ‘A’ishah who narrated the story
of her departure and how they brought her back and the delivery of her
pregnancy and how Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, had sent Zaid Ibn Harithah with his ring. He gave the ring to
Zainab and when she saw it, she immediately recognized her father’s ring,
she asked: “Who gave you this?” Zaid replied, “A man at the outskirt of
Makkah.” Zainab left by night and she rode behind him till they arrived
in Madinah. ‘A’ishah added: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him,
used to say: “She is the most beloved to me of my daughters who was
persecuted because of me.” When this narration reached ‘Ali Ibn AlHusain Ibn Zainul-‘Abideen, he came to ‘Urwah and said: “What is this
report reaching me that you are detracting from the worth of Fatimah?”
‘Urwah replied: “By Allah, I will not detract from the right belonging to
Fatimah, for all that is between the East and the West. After this, I shall
never narrate it again.”
Ibn Ishaq related that Abul-‘As remained in Makkah upon his disbelief
and Zainab remained with her father in Madinah till just before the
Conquest of Makkah, when Abul-‘As departed on a trade mission to Syria
on behalf of the Quraish. On his way back, he was intercepted by a
Muslim raider and they took his merchandise but he managed to escape.
At night, he came to Zainab, his wife, to seek her protection and the return
of his merchandise. In the early morning, when the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, began to lead the people in the
Subh prayer, Zainab shouted from the Suffah of the women: “O people, I
have given Al-‘As Ibn Ar-Rabee‘ protection.” When the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, concluded the Salat, he
turned to face the people and said: “Did you hear what I heard?” They
replied in the affirmation and he added: “By the One in Whose Hands is
the soul of Muhammad, I had known nothing about the matter before
hearing what you have heard. The Muslims can protect whoever is lower
than them.” Then the Messenger of Allah came to his daughter, Zainab,
63

In The Defence Of the True Faith
and said: “Make his stay comfortable but do not let him touch you for you
are not lawful for him.” Then Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, goaded the Companions to return his merchandise to
him and they did so without anything missing from it. Abul-‘As took his
merchandise and headed for Makkah. On his arrival, he returned the
merchandise to their owners and then said: “Does anyone still have
anything with me which he has not collected?” They said: “No, may Allah
reward you. We have found you to be faithful and noble.” Then he said:
“However, I bear witness that none deserves to be worshipped (in truth)
but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. By Allah,
nothing had prevented me from accepting Islam except that I feared that
you might think that I wanted to usurp your wealth. When Allah has
returned them to you and I am through with the trade mission, I have
accepted Islam.” Then he departed till he came back to Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessing of Allah be upon him.
Ibn Ishaq said that Dawood Ibn Al-Husain narrated to me from ‘Ikrimah
from Ibn ‘Abbas who said: “The Messenger of Allah restored Zainab to
him upon the first marriage contract and he did not say anything.” This
Hadith has been related by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhi and
Ibn Majah from the Hadith of Muhammad Ibn Ishaq.

The Battle of Banu Sulaim in the 2nd Year of Hijrah
Ibn Ishaq related: The Messenger of Allah’s conclusion of the Battle of
Badr was at the close of the month of Ramadan or in Shawwal. When he
returned to Madinah, he did not spend seven nights before he again led
another military contingent against Banu Sulaim. Ibn Hisham said: He
appointed Siba’ Ibn ‘Urfutah Al-Ghifari or Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind,
to govern Madinah. Ibn Ishaq said that when they reached one of their
watering holes named Al-Kudr, they encamped there for three nights and
then returned to Madinah without any confrontation. The Messenger of
Allah remained in Madinah for the remainder of the months of Shawwal
and Dhul-Qa‘dah during which most of the remaining Quraish prisoners
of war were ransomed.

64

In The Defence Of the True Faith

The Invasion of As-Saweeq in Dhul-Hijjah
Ibn Ishaq related from ‘Abdullah Ibn Ka‘b Ibn Malik, and he was one of
the most knowledgeable of the Ansar, that when the Quraish returned to
Makkah after being vanquished at Badr, Abu Sufyan vowed never to take
a bath from sexual defilement until he attacked Muhammad. He led a
Calvary of two hundred men from the Quraish to carry out his pledge.
When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
got wind of his movement, he set out after them and he appointed Abu
Lubabah Basheer Ibn ‘Abdul-Mundhir in charge of Madinah. The Quraish
riders fled from the approaching Muslim, abandoning many of their
provisions in order to make the movement of their retreat light. The
Muslims took these (abandoned provisions) for themselves. Much of their
abandoned food was Saweeq so the military operation was nicknamed
“The Invasion of Saweeq.” The Companions asked the Prophet: “O
Messenger of Allah, do you think that this will be counted as an invasion
for us?” “Yes,” he answered.

Ali’s Consummates His Marriage With Fatimah, the
Daughter of Allah’s Messenger
That occurred after the Battle of Badr in the second year of Hijrah based
on what is related by both Bukhari and Muslim from ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib,
who said that: “There fell to my lot a she-camel out of the spoils of war
on the day of Badr and Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, gave me (another) she-camel on that day out of the Khumus
(one-fifth reserved for Allah and His Messenger). When I made up my
mind to consummate my marriage with Fatimah, the daughter of Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, I prevailed upon a
goldsmith of the tribe of Qainuqa’ to go along with me so that we might
bring Idhkhir, wishing to sell that to the goldsmiths so that I could arrange
my wedding feast. While I was arranging the equipments, i.e. litters, sacks
and ropes, my two she-camels were sitting down at the side of the
apartment of a person of the Ansar. I collected (the different articles) and
found to my surprise that their humps had been chopped off and their
haunches had been cut off and their livers had been taken out. I could not
help weeping when I saw that plight of theirs. I said: “Who has done that?”
65

In The Defence Of the True Faith
They said: Hamzah Ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib has done this and he is in this
house in a drinking bout in the company of some of the Ansar with a
singing girl before him and his companions. She said in her song: “O
Hamzah, get up and attack these plumpy she-camels.”
Thereupon, Hamzah stood up with a sword (in his hand) and cut off their
humps and ripped their haunches and tore out their livers. ‘Ali said: I went
away until I came to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, and with him was Zaid Ibn Harithah. Allah’s Messenger
recognized from my face that something had happened, so Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked: “What has
happened to you?” I said: “Messenger of Allah, by Allah, I have never
seen (such an unfortunate day) as this day. Hamzah has committed
aggression against my she-camels, and has cut off their humps and ripped
their haunches, and he is in a house in the company of some drunkards.”
(Hearing this) Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, sent for his mantle and, putting it on proceeded, and I and Zaid Ibn
Harithah followed him, until he came to the door (of the house) in which
there was Hamzah. He (the Prophet) sought permission which they
granted him and they were all drunk. Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, began to reprimand Hamzah for what he
had done. Hamzah’s eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah’s Messenger
and then looked toward his knees and then lifted his eyes and cast a glance
at his waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then Hamzah
said: "Are you anything but the slaves of my father?" Allah’s Messenger,
peace be upon him, came to know that he was intoxicated, and he turned
back and came out; we also came out along with him.” This is the version
of Al-Bukhari in the Book of Military Expedition.
Abu Dawood also related that Ibn ‘Abbas said that when ‘Ali married
Fatimah, may Allah be pleased with both, Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Give her something.” ‘Ali said: “I
do not have anything with me.” The Prophet said: “Where is the shield?”

The Aggregate Events that Occurred in the 2nd Year
of Hijrah
We earlier related the story of the Prophet’s marriage to ‘A’ishah, the
Mother of the Believers. We also mentioned what had transpired in
various notable military expeditions. It also included the death of several
notable Muslims and disbelievers within the same period. Among those
who died included the martyrs of Badr. They were fourteen, from both the
Muhajiroon and the Ansar, whose names we have mentioned earlier. It
also included chiefs of the polytheists of Quraish. They were seventy men
according to the popular view; and right after the Battle of Badr, Abu
Lahab Abdul-‘Uzza Ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib also died, may Allah’s curse be
upon him, as mentioned earlier as well.
Zaid Ibn Harithah and ‘Abdullah Ibn Rawaahah gave the good news to the
Believers in Madinah that Allah defeated the Mushrikeen and gave victory
to the Muslims. [When the Muslims returned] they found that Ruqayyah,
the daughter of Allah’s Messenger, had died and had been buried. Her
husband, ‘Uthman had stayed behind to look after her upon the orders of
the Prophet. This is why he was given a portion from the booty of Badr
and his reward also lies with Allah on the Day of Judgment. Thereafter,
the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, gave
him Umm Kulthoom, the daughter of Allah’s Messenger, for marriage.
This is why ‘Uthman was referred to as Dhum-Noorain (the possessor of
two lights). It is also said that no one married two daughters of the
Prophet, one after the other, except him. May Allah be pleased with him.
In the same period, the direction of the Qiblah was changed, as mentioned
earlier; the prayer of a resident person was also increased. In the same
period, Zakatul-Fitr (charity given at the end of Ramadan fast) was also
made obligatory. It also witnessed the subjugation of the polytheists of
Madinah as well as the Jews who also lived in Madinah from Banu
Qainuqa’, Banu Nadeer, Banu Quraizah and the Jews of Banu Harithah.
Many of the polytheists and Jews openly declared Islam but in reality they
were hypocrites. Some of them remained upon their disbelief and some of
them became thoroughly confused and so they dilly-dallied. They were
neither here nor there and as Allah described them in the Qur’an: “(They
67

In The Defence Of the True Faith
are) swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those
who also accepted Islam.”

The 3rd Year of Hijrah
The invasion of Najd occurred in the beginning of the third year of Hijrah.
The invasion is also known as Dhu Amarr. Ibn Ishaq said that when the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, returned
from the invasion of As-Saweeq, he remained in Madinah for the
remainder of Dhul-Hijjah or close to it. Then he carried out the invasion
of Najd against Ghatafan, it was also known as the Battle of
Dhu Amarr. Ibn Hisham added: He appointed over Madinah in his place,
‘Uthman Ibn ‘Affaan. Ibn Ishaq continued: Spending nearly the entire
month of Safar in Najd, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, returned to Madinah without any fighting.
The Arabs escaped from him into the mountain peaks. The Muslims
marched till they reached a watering hole called Dhu Amarr and they
encamped there. There was a heavy downpour and the cloth of Allah’s
Messenger was drenched so he rested under a tree and spread his cloth in
order to dry it. All of these happened within the purview of the
Mushrikeen and they became engrossed in their affairs. Finally, the
Mushrikoon sent a brave man called Ghawrath Ibn Al-Harith or Du'thoor
Ibn Al-Harith and they gave him a clear instruction: “Allah will enable
you to kill Muhammad.” So the man set off on his mission. He stood over
the Messenger of Allah with a drawn sword and said: “O Muhammad,
who will save you from me today?” “Allah,” the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said calmly. Jibraeel struck the
chest of the man and the sword fell off his hand and the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, took it and said to him:
“Who will save you from me?” and the man said: “No one but I bear
witness that none deserves to be worshipped but Allah and that
Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.”
By Allah, no host can ever overcome him. Then the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, returned his sword to him.
When the man returned to his people, they inquired of him: “Woe be to
you, what happened to you?” He said: “I saw a tall man who hit me on the
68

In The Defence Of the True Faith
chest and I fell flat on my back and I knew it was an angel and I bore
witness that Muhammad is a Messenger of Allah and, by Allah, no host
can ever overcome him.” He kept inviting his people to Islam. It is
concerning this that Allah revealed: O you who believe! Remember the
Favor of Allah unto you when some people desired (made a plan) to
stretch out their hands against you, but (Allah) withheld their hands from
you. So fear Allah. And in Allah let Believers put their trust. (Soorah AlMa'idah 5:11)

The Trial of the Jews of Banu Qainuqa’ from the
People of Madinah
They were the subject of the statement of Allah: They are like their
immediate predecessors (the Jews of Bani Qainuqa’, who suffered), they
tasted the evil result of their conduct, and (in the Hereafter, there is) for
them a painful torment. (Soorah Al-Hashr 59:15)
Ibn Ishaq said that the narration concerning them is that Allah’s
Messenger, peace be upon him, requested them to gather in their
marketplace and he addressed them saying: “O company of Jews, be
careful of the kind of tragedy that befell the Quraish, accept Islam for you
have come to know that I am a Prophet that has been sent. You have found
that recorded in your Scripture and a promise from Allah to you.” They
replied: “O Muhammad, do you assume that we are your people? Do not
be deceived by the fact that you fought with a group who lack the
knowledge of military tactics and you scored an opportunity. If you fight
us then you will know what sort of people we are (in military capability).”
Ibn ‘Abbas related: The following Verses of the Qur’an were revealed
concerning no other people but them: Say (O Muhammad) to those who
disbelieve: “You will be defeated and gathered together to Hell, and worst
indeed is that place to rest.” There has already been a sign for you (O
Jews) in the two armies that met (in combat i.e. the Battle of Badr)... i.e.
between the warriors of Badr among the Companions of the Messenger of
Allah and the Quraish. ...One was fighting in the Cause of Allah, and as
for the other (they) were disbelievers. They (the believers) saw them (the
disbelievers) with their own eyes twice their number (although they were
thrice their number). And Allah supports with His Victory whom He
69

In The Defence Of the True Faith
pleases. Verily, in this is a lesson for those who understand. (Soorah Aal
‘Imran 3:12, 13)
Abu ‘Awn narrated that the case of the Banu Qainuqa’ came to a head
when an Arab woman went with her jewelry to the market of the Banu
Qainuqa’. She sat down in the goldsmith’s shop. A group of Jews who
had gathered around her kept pressurizing her to uncover her face to which
she objected. The goldsmith, unknown to her pinned the hem of her cloth
to her back. When she got up, her body became exposed and the Jews
started laughing at her. The woman cried out and a man from the Muslims
pounced upon the Jewish goldsmith and killed him. The Jews also fell
upon him and killed him in return. The spark ignited into a war between
the Muslims and the Banu Qainuqa’. ”
Ibn Ishaq related that ‘Asim Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Qatadah said: The Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, sieged them till they
were forced to surrender and accept his judgment. Then ‘Abdullah Ibn
Ubayy Ibn Salool rose and said: “O Muhammad, be kind to my clients.”
Banu Qainuqa’ were allies of the Khazraj. The Prophet did not reply
immediately and ‘Abdullah repeated his demand: “O Muhammad, be kind
to my clients.” The Prophet turned away from him but he held onto the
armor of the Prophet known as Dhatul-Fudool.
The Messenger of Allah’s color changed and he said: “Let me go!” He
became so angry that the bystanders saw his face darkened. Then he said:
“Woe to you, let me go!” But ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said: “No, I shall not
let you go till you show kindness to my clients. Four hundred without
armor and three hundred with armor. They have protected me from all and
sundry. Now you are going to slaughter them in one morning? By Allah,
I am a man who is afraid of the consequences.” Then the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to him: “They are
yours.”
Ibn Hisham added that Allah’s Messenger appointed Abu Lubababh
Basheer Ibn ‘Abdul-Mundhir in charge of the blockade which lasted for
fifteen nights. Ibn Ishaq related that ‘Ubadah Ibn Samit said, when the
Messenger of Allah went to war with Banu Qainuqa’, ‘Abdullah Ibn
Ubayy became obstinate in defending them, ‘Ubadah Ibn Samit, who was
70

In The Defence Of the True Faith
from Banu ‘Awf, who had alliances with them just like ‘Abdullah Ibn
Ubayy, went up to Allah’s Messenger and repudiated their alliances and
clientele with them in preference for Allah and His Messenger. He said:
“I ally myself to Allah, His Messenger, the Believers and I free myself
from the alliance with these disbelievers and their clientele.” It is
concerning him and ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy that Allah revealed the Verses
in Soorah Al-Ma’idah:
O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliya’
(friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya’ to one another
(Soorah Al-Ma'idah 5:51) till the Verse, (And you see those in whose
hearts there is a disease (of hypocrisy), they hurry to their friendship,
saying: “We fear lest some misfortune of a disaster may befall us. (Soorah
Al-Ma'idah 5:52) i.e. ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy up to the statement, And
whosoever takes Allah, His Messenger, and those who have believed, as
Protectors, then the party of Allah will be the victorious. (Soorah AlMa'idah 5:56) i.e. ‘Ubadah Ibn As-Samit. We had discussed this in the
Tafseer.

The Expedition of Zaid Ibn Harithah to Capture the
Quraishi Caravan Led by Abu Sufyan
Yoonus related from Bukair from Ibn Ishaq that this incident occurred ten
months after the Battle of Badr. The Quraish were afraid to pursue their
usual trade route to Syria so they took the road to Iraq. Some of the
merchants went out, including Abu Sufyan, carrying a large amount of
silver which constitutes most of their trade. They appointed Furat Ibn
Hayyan from Banu Bakr Ibn Wa’il as a guide along that route. At once
the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, sent
Zaid who intercepted them by the watering place of Najd called "AlQaradah" and captured the caravan with its good but the men fled. He
brought the booty to the Messenger of Allah.

The Killing of Ka‘b Ibn Al-Ashraf, the Jew
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said, “Who
is willing to kill Ka‘b Ibn AlAshraf, who has hurt Allah and His
Messenger?” Thereupon Muhammad Ibn Maslamah got up saying, “O
71

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Allah’s Messenger! Would you like that I kill him?” The Prophet said,
“Yes,” Muhammad Ibn Maslamah said, “Then allow me to say a (false)
thing (i.e. to deceive Ka‘b). “The Prophet said, “You may say it.” Then
Muhammad Ibn Maslamah went to Ka‘b and said, “That man (i.e.
Muhammad) demands Sadaqah (i.e. Zakat) from us, and he has troubled
us, and I have come to borrow something from you.” On that, Ka‘b said,
“By Allah, you will get tired of him!” Muhammad Ibn Maslamah said,
“Now as we have followed him, we do not want to leave him unless and
until we see how his end is going to be. Now we want you to lend us a
camel load or two of food.” (There are some differences among the
narrators whether he requested for a camel load or two.) Ka‘b said, “Yes,
(I will lend you), but you should mortgage something to me.” Muhammad
Ibn Maslamah and his companion said, “What do you want?” Ka‘b
replied, “Mortgage your women to me.” They said, “How can we
mortgage our women to you and you are the most handsome of the
‘Arabs?” Ka‘b said, “Then, mortgage your sons to me.” They said, “How
can we mortgage our sons to you? Later they would be abused by the
people’s saying that so-andso has been mortgaged for a camel load of
food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will mortgage our arms
to you.” Muhammad Ibn Maslamah and his companion promised Ka‘b
that Muhammad would return to him. He came to Ka‘b at night along with
Ka‘b’s foster brother, Abu Na’ilah. Ka‘b invited them to come into his
fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him, “Where are you
going at this time?” Ka‘b replied, “None but Muhammad Ibn Maslamah
and my (foster) brother Abu Na’ilah have come.” His wife said, “I hear a
voice as if blood is dripping from him.” Ka‘b said, “They are none but my
brother Muhammad Ibn Maslamah and my foster brother Abu Na'ilah. A
generous man should respond to a call at night even if invited to be killed.”
Muhammad Ibn Maslamah went with two men. (Some narrators mention
the men as Abu Abs Ibn Bin Jabr, Al-Harith Ibn Aws and Abbad Ibn
Bishr). So Muhammad Ibn Maslamah went in together with two men, and
said to them, “When Ka‘b comes, I will touch his hair and smell it, and
when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip him. I will let you
smell his head.” Ka‘b Ibn Al-Ashraf came down to them wrapped in his
clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muhammad Ibn Maslamah said. “I have
never smelt a better scent than this. Ka‘b replied. “I have got the best Arab
women who know how to use the high class of perfume.” Muhammad Ibn
Maslamah requested Ka‘b “Will you allow me to smell your head?” Ka‘b
72

In The Defence Of the True Faith
said, “Yes.” Muhammad smelt it and made his companions smell it as
well. Then he requested Ka‘b again, “Will you let me (smell your head)?”
Ka‘b said, “Yes.” When Muhammad got a strong hold of him, he said (to
his companions), “Get at him!” So they killed him and went to the Prophet
and informed him.

The Battle of Uhud in Shawwal, the 3rd Year of
Hijrah
The author relates to us that the reason why Uhud was so named is because
of the solitude of its mountain. In the Saheeh, it is reported that Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Uhud is a
mountain that loves us and we love it.” Its meaning is that its inhabitants
love us and we also love them. It is also said that it is owing to the fact
that it gives one the impression of the proximity of his family upon return
from his journey just as the beloved would do. It is also said that literally,
it is similar to Allah’s statement: And indeed, there are stones out of which
rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which split
asunder so that water flows from them, and indeed, there are of them
(stones) which fall down for fear of Allah. (Soorah Al-Baqarah 2:74)
This battle occurred in the Shawwal of the 3rd year of Hijrah. Malik said:
Its occurrence was in the first few days of the month based on the most
popular view. It is concerning this battle that Allah says: And (remember)
when you (Muhammad) left your household in the morning to post the
Believers at their stations for the Battle (of Uhud). And Allah is AllHearer, All-Knower. When two parties from among you were about to
lose heart, but Allah was their Wali (Supporter and Protector). And in
Allah should the Believers put their trust. And Allah has already made
you victorious at Badr, when you were a weak little force. So fear Allah
much [abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has
forbidden and love Allah much, perform all kinds of good deeds which
He has ordained] that you may be grateful. (Remember) when you
(Muhammad) said to the Believers, “Is it not enough for you that your
Lord (Allah) should help you with three thousand angels; sent down?”
“Yes, if you hold on to patience and piety, and the enemy comes rushing
at you; your Lord will help you with five thousand angels having marks
73

In The Defence Of the True Faith
(of distinction); (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:121-125) and the Verses following
them up to the Verse:
Allah (SWT) will not leave the Believers in the state in which you are
now, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good. Nor will Allah
disclose to you the secrets of the Ghaib (unseen), but Allah chooses of His
Messengers whom He pleases. So believe in Allah and His Messengers.
And if you believe and fear Allah, then for you there is a great reward
(Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:179)
When the Quraish polytheists were defeated in the battle and their
vanquished soldiers returned to Makkah, Abu Sufyan had also returned
with his caravan. ‘Abdullah Ibn Abi Rabee‘ah, ‘Ikrimah Ibn Abi Jahl,
Safwan Ibn Umayyah among a couple of other Quraishi men whose
fathers, sons and brothers were killed in the Battle of Badr came to meet
Abu Sufyan to consult with him and other merchants in his caravan. They
said: “O Quraish, Muhammad has left us with your best men killed, assist
us with this wealth so that we may wage war against him in revenge.” And
they did so.
Ibn Ishaq said: I have been informed by some men of knowledge that it is
concerning them that Allah revealed: Verily, those who disbelieve spend
their wealth to hinder (men) from the Path of Allah, and so will they
continue to spend it; but in the end it will become an anguish for them.
Then they will be overcomed. And those who disbelieve will be gathered
unto Hell. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:36)
So the Quraish mobilized for war in conjunction with some amenable
members of the Arab tribes of Kinanah and Tihamah against Allah’s
Messenger after Abu Sufyan and his compatriots in the caravan had
supported the war effort.
Jubair Ibn Mut‘im called his Abyssinian slave boy Wahshi, who was very
proficient in spear throwing. He said to him to march out along with the
army, if you succeed in killing Hamzah, Muhammad’s uncle, in retaliation
for the death of my uncle Tu’aimah Ibn Adiyy, then you will be
manumitted. Abu Sufyan Sakhr Ibn Harb departed with the Quraishi
forces which he himself commanded. With him were his wife, Hind Bint
74

In The Defence Of the True Faith
‘Utbah, Ibn Rabee‘ah, ‘Ikrimah Ibn Abi Jahl and his wife, his uncle AlHarith Ibn Hisham and his wife Fatimah Bint Al-Waleed Ibn AlMugheerah. Safwan Ibn Umayyah also joined the Quraish contingent with
Barzah Bint Mas‘ood Ibn ‘Amr Ibn ‘Umair Ath-Thaqafiyyah. The list also
included ‘Amr Ibn Al-‘As along with Raitah Bint Munabbih Ibn AlHajjaj, who was the mother of ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Amr.
Abu Moosa Al-Ash‘ari narrated that the Prophet said: “In a dream I saw
myself migrating from Makkah to a place having plenty of date trees. I
thought that it was Al-Yamamah or Hajar, but it came to be Madinah i.e.
Yathrib. In the same dream I saw myself moving a sword and its blade got
broken. It came to symbolize the defeat which the Muslims suffered on
the day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal as before,
and that was the symbol of the victory Allah bestowed upon Muslims and
their gathering together. I saw cows in my dream, and, by Allah, that was
a blessing, and they symbolized the Believers on the day of Uhud. And
the blessing was the good Allah bestowed upon us and the reward of true
belief which Allah gave us after the day of Badr.”
Muhammad Ibn Ishaq related that while the Messenger of Allah, peace be
upon him, related his dream to his Companions, he said to them: “We
should remain encamped in Madinah. “ ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy supported
the Messenger of Allah’s plan not to go out to fight them. Some men
whom Allah honored with martyrdom at Uhud and others who did not
fight at Badr said: “O Messenger of Allah, let us march out against the
enemies otherwise they will think that we are cowards and weak to fight
them.”
‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said: “O Messenger of Allah, do not go out to
confront them. Never did we go out of the city to fight an enemy except
that we were defeated and never did anyone come here except that they
were vanquished.” The people who were eager for war kept pressurizing
the Messenger of Allah till he entered his room and put on his armor. That
incident was on a Friday after the prayers. Malik Ibn ‘Amr from Banu
Najjar had died that day. After the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, offered the funeral prayer on him, he
marched out for war. Soon the Companions began to regret coercing the
Prophet into fighting against his will. When he came out, they said to him:
75

In The Defence Of the True Faith
“O Allah’s Messenger, if you so desire, you can remain in Madinah.” He
replied: “It is not fitting for a Prophet after putting on his armor to take it
off until he has fought.” The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, set
out with a thousand of his Companions. Ibn Hisham added that he
appointed Ibn Umm Maktoom to oversee the affairs of Madinah in his
absence.
Ibn Ishaq continued: The Messenger of Allah proceeded till he reached
Ash-Shawt, at a distance between Madinah and Uhud; there, ‘Abdullah
Ibn Ubayy withdrew with one-third of the Muslim forces. He said to his
cohorts: “He (the Messenger of Allah) obeyed them and disobeyed me, I
do not see the reason why we should kill ourselves here, O people.” So he
withdrew with his followers from the hypocrites and doubters. ‘Abdullah
Ibn ‘Amr Ibn Haram As-Salami, Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah’s father, followed
them appealing: “O people, I remind you of Allah, do not forsake your
people and your Prophet while their enemy is nearby.” They said: “If we
know for sure that there would be a fight, we would not abandon you, but
we don’t think there will be any fighting.” When they persisted in
withdrawing, he said: “May Allah distance you, O enemies of Allah, Allah
will surely make His Prophet be rid of you.”
I says: These group who betrayed the Prophet and the Muslims were the
same set of people concerning whom Allah says: And that He might test
the hypocrites, it was said to them: “Come, fight in the way of Allah or
(at least) defend yourselves.” They said: “Had we known that fighting will
take place, we would certainly have followed you.” They were that day,
nearer to disbelief than to Faith, saying with their mouths what was not in
their hearts. And Allah has full knowledge of what they conceal. (Soorah
Aal ‘Imran 3:167) i.e. they lied in their statement that, Then what is the
matter with you that you are divided into two parties about the hypocrites?
Allah has cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they have earned.
(Soorah An-Nisa’ 4:88)
This is because a party of them said: “Let us fight against them” while the
others said, “Let us not fight against them,” as apparent from the narration
related in the Saheeh. ‘Urwah and Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah related that when
‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy withdrew with his followers, Banu Salamah and
Banu Harithah became dejected, thus, Allah strengthened them. He says:
76

In The Defence Of the True Faith
When two parties from among you were about to lose heart, but Allah was
their Wali (Supporter and Protector). And in Allah should the believers
put their trust. (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:122)
Jabir ibn Abdullah said: I would not like that it was not revealed since
Allah said: Allah was their Wali as is established in the Saheehain from
him.
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
proceeded till they dismounted and camped at the mountain pass of Uhud
by the slope of the valley and around the mountain. The Prophet
positioned his army in such a way that they backed mount Uhud. He gave
them strict instruction: “No one should precipitate in a fight until I order
him to do so.” Meanwhile, the Quraish Calvary and infantry had
disembarked at a pasture situated at the brink of a water source belonging
to the Muslims. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, mobilized
his men, now reduced to seven hundred men. He appointed ‘Abdullah Ibn
Jubair, a member of Banu ‘Amr Ibn ‘Awf. That day, he was distinguished
with a white cloth which he wore. The archers were fifty in number and
the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
clarified their mission: “Drive off the Calvary from us with showers of
arrows lest they should attack us from behind. Whether we are having the
upper hand or being defeated, remain in your position, so that they do not
attack us from your flank.” A corroboration of that from the Saheehain
shall be presented in due course, if Allah permits.
Ibn Ishaq said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, appeared wearing two coats of mail, one over the other and he
handed the flag to Mus‘ab Ibn ‘Umair, a member of the Banu Abdud-Dar
tribe.
Allah’s Messenger had turned back a couple of youngsters from the Battle
of Badr due to their age, among whom was: ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Umar, as is
related in the Saheehain. He himself narrated: “I was presented to the
Prophet on the day of Uhud but he did not permit me (to partake in the
battle). However, I was presented to him on the day of Khandaq when I
was fifteen years old, and he permitted me (to partake in the war).”
77

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Imam Ahmad related that Anas narrated that Allah’s Messenger, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, took hold of his sword on the day of
Uhud and said: “Who will take this sword from me?” All the people
(present) stretched out their hands saying: “I will do it, I will do it.” He
(Allah’s Messenger) said: “Who will take it in order to fulfill its rights?”
Then the people withdrew their hands. Abu Dujanah Simak said: “I am
here to take it and fulfill its rights.” He took it and struck the heads of the
polytheists. Muslim also related it from Abi Bakr from ‘Affan.
Ibn Ishaq related that Abu Dujanah was a valiant man. He would prance
about on the battlefield in arrogant and taunting gait brandishing his sword
shining like a blaze of fire. Whenever he wore a red headband, people
knew that he was going to fight. When he took the sword from Allah’s
Messenger, he pranced about on the battlefield in arrogant and taunting
gait between the two lines (i.e. of the two opposing forces).
He (Ibn Ishaq) added: Ja‘afar Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn Aslam Mawla ‘Umar
narrated to me from a man from Banu Salimah who said: When Allah saw
the arrogant gait of Abu Dujanah, he said: “This kind of walk is hateful to
Allah except (it is excused) in this kind of situation.”
Ibn Ishaq continued: Abu Sufyan said to the standard-bearers of Banu
Abdud-Dar while goading to war: “O Banu Abdud-Dar, you have
assigned to bear our flag in the Battle of Badr and you know what has
happened. The first standard is the first thing the enemies assail, should it
fall, the entire army falls as well. Thus, either you guard its safely on our
behalf, or you leave it for us and we will certainly relieve you of that
burden.” They got infuriated and threatened him saying: “Do you want us
to deliver to you our standard? Tomorrow, when we start the battle, you
will observe our (valiant) exploit.” That is exactly what Abu Sufyan
intended.
When the two armies drew close to each other, Hind, the daughter of
‘Utbah along with other women with her, beat on tambourines behind the
ranks of the Quraish warriors in order to incite them.
Ibn Hisham added: I have been informed by more than one scholar that
Az-Zubair Ibn Al-‘Awwam said: “I felt a disappointment in my mind
78

In The Defence Of the True Faith
when I requested Allah’s Messenger for the sword but he declined to give
me but handed it over to Abu Dujanah. I said to myself: ‘I am the son of
Safiyyah, his aunt, I am also a Quraishi and I rose to take the sword and I
had requested it before him and yet he gave it to Abu Dujanah instead of
me. By Allah, I am going to see what he will do with it.’ So I followed
him. He took out a red band and wound up it around his head and the
Ansar exclaimed: “Abu Dujanah has brought out the band of death.” This
is what they usually say whenever he wounds his head band.

The Death of Hamzah
Ibn Ishaq related that Ja‘far Ibn ‘Amr Ibn Umayyah Ad-Damri narrated: I
went out with ‘Ubaidullah Ibn ‘Adiyy Ibn Al-Khiyar from Banu Nawfal
Ibn ‘Abd Manaf during the reign of Mu‘awiyyah. We passed by Hims
where Wahshi, the freed slave of Jubair had settled. When we reached
there, ‘Ubaidullah Ibn ‘Adiyy suggested: “Do you mind that we approach
so that we may ask him how he killed Hamzah?” I said to him: “If you
wish.”
So we proceeded till we got to him. We sat in his presence and said: “We
have come so that you may narrate to us how you killed Hamzah?” He
said: “I shall narrate to you exactly as I had narrated to Allah’s Messenger
when he asked me concerning that. I was a slave boy of Jubair Ibn Mut‘im
whose uncle was Tu‘aimah Ibn ‘Adiyy who was killed in the Battle of
Badr. When the Quraish marched to the Battle of Uhud, Jubair said to me:
‘If you succeed in killing Hamzah, Muhammad’s uncle, in retaliation for
the killing of my uncle you will be manumitted.’ So I departed with the
rest of the army and I am an Abyssinian who is as proficient in spearthrowing as any Abyssinian and when I throw, I do not miss my target.
When the two forces clashed, I began to look for Hamzah on the
battlefield. Then I saw him in the midst of people like a camel cutting his
enemy with devastating blows from his sword. Nothing could withstand
his valor. I would recoil to hide behind a tree or rock waiting for him to
move closer but just before I could throw it, Siba' Ibn ‘Abdul ‘Uzza cut in
to challenge Hamzah. When he saw him, Hamzah said: “Come on, you
son of clitoris-cutter.” Hamzah struck him with a single and swift blow
which severed his head. I shook the spear in my hand until I had a firm
79

In The Defence Of the True Faith
grip on it. I hurled it at Hamzah piercing him just below the navel and it
came out between his legs. He made an attempt to reach me but had
extreme difficulty in moving and then he fell to the ground. I left him with
the spear still embedded in him till he died.
“After he had become still, I came close to his corpse, removed the spear
from his body and headed for the camp of the Quraish and I remained
there for the duration of the battle for I had no other business than that. I
killed him solely to obtain my freedom.
“When we returned to Makkah, I was freed. I remained in Makkah until
Allah’s Messenger conquered it and I fled to Ta’if where I settled. When
the delegates of Ta’if went to the Messenger of Allah to declare their
acceptance of Islam, I began to contemplate on where to flee to again. I
said to myself: ‘I will go to Sham or Yemen or some other land.’ I was
still in my distressful state when a man told me: ‘Woe be to you, by Allah,
he does not kill anyone who enters his religion and utters the declaration
of truth.' When I was informed of that, I set out till I stood at the presence
of the Messenger of Allah in Madinah and then I utter the shahadah. When
he saw me he said: ‘Is it you, Wahshi?’ I said, ‘Yes, Messenger of Allah.’
He said, 'Sit down, narrate to me, how did you kill Hamzah?’ I told him,
and when I finished, he said to me, ‘Woe to you! Get out of my sight and
let me not see your face again.’ From that time, I always avoided wherever
the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, went lest he should
see me, till he died.
Afterward, when the Muslims went out to fight Musailimah, the Liar, I
went with them. I took with me the same spear with which I had killed
Hamzah. When the armies met, I saw Musailimah standing with his sword
in his hand. By Allah, I did not recognize him. Just then one Ansari
targeted him from another angle. Both of us were prepared for him. When
he fell in my full range, I shook my spear till I had full control over it,
threw it, and it went into his body. Then the Ansari swooped on him and
lacerated him with his sword. Allah knows best which one of us killed
him. If I was the one who killed him, then I had killed the best of people
after the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
(Hamzah) and now I have killed the worst of people (Musailimah).”
80

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Bukhari also related the story of Hamzah’s death from Ja‘afar Ibn
‘Amr Ibn Umayyah Ad-Damri who said: I went out with ‘Abdullah Ibn
‘Adiyy Ibn Al-Khiyar. And he narrated the story as related above and he
mentioned that ‘Ubaidullah Ibn ‘Adiyy was wearing his turban and
Wahshi could not see except his eyes and feet and he related how he still
was able to recognize him as related previously.
Ibn Hisham related: Maslamah Ibn Alqamah Al-Mazini narrated to me
that when the fighting intensified on the day of Uhud, the Messenger of
Allah, peace be upon him, sat under the standard of the Ansar and he sent
word to ‘Ali to go before the standard; he did so while chanting: “I am a
father of astuteness.” Then Abu Sa‘d Ibn Abi Talhah, the standard-bearer
of the polytheists, called out to him: “Do you care for a duel, O father of
astuteness?” and ‘Ali responded in the affirmation. They exchanged two
strokes of sword between the two lines of the opposing armies and soon
‘Ali struck him mortally and then withdrew without pouncing on him to
finish him off. When his friends asked him why he did not finish him off,
he said: “He exposed his nakedness to me (as a sign of abject surrender)
and the feeling of compassion for blood tie overtook me but I knew that
Allah had already killed him.”
Ibn Ishaq related: Hanzalah (who was called: “the washed one,” because
the angels washed him at his death as shall be explained later) and Abu
Sufyan Sakhr Ibn Harb met at the battle. When Hanzalah had
overpowered Abu Sufyan, Shaddad Ibn Al-Aswad who was the same
person referred to as Ibn Sha‘oob, double-crossed him and struck him a
mortal blow. After Hanzalah had died, the Messenger of Allah said: “Your
Companion is being washed by the angels, ask his wife if there was
something that happened to him.” So they asked his wife whose name,
according to Al-Waqidi, was Jameelah Bint Ubayy Ibn Salool. At the
time, she was newly wedded to him, as they married on the same day of
the battle. She said: “He hurried into the battlefield when he heard the war
cry while he was still in a state of sexual defilement.” The Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “It is for this reason
that the angels washed him.”
Ibn Ishaq added that afterwards Allah sent down his help to the Muslims
and fulfilled His promise. They uprooted their enemies with their swords
81

In The Defence Of the True Faith
and dragged them from their camp. It was an obvious defeat. Yahya Ibn
‘Abbad Ibn Abdullah Ibn Az-Zubair narrated to me from his father ‘Ubad
from ‘Abdullah Ibn Az-Zubair who said: “By Allah, I saw the anklets of
Hind Bint ‘Utbah and her cohorts as they folded their dress while fleeing.
Nothing prevented anyone from capturing them when the archers turned
to the camp as the enemy had been thrown out of it. Thus, we were
attacked from behind by the Calvary. Someone yelled: 'Alas! Muhammad
has been killed.’ We returned and the enemy pursued us after we had
killed the standard-bearers in succession in such a way that none of them
dared to hoist it. Some of the men of knowledge informed me that the
standard remained fallen until Amrah Bint Alqamah Al-Harithiyyah took
it and hoisted so that they might gather the Quraish around it. The standard
had been borne by a slave boy of Banu Abi Talhah Habashi and he was
the last person of them to hoist the flag. He fought with it till his hands
were severed. Then he stooped to pick the flag which he held with his
chest and neck and he held it till he was killed.
Ibn Ishaq added: The Muslims became vulnerable and they were pelted
by the enemies. It was a day of trial and test in which Allah ennobled
many of them with martyrdom. The enemies were unrelenting until they
had access to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, who was hurt with stones so much so that he fell on his side,
one of his teeth was broken. His face was gashed and his lip was injured.
It was ‘Utbah Ibn Abi Waqqas who injured him. Humaid At-Taweel
narrated to me from Anas Ibn Malik who said: “The Messenger of Allah,
peace be upon him, had his front teeth damaged on the day of the Battle
of Uhud, and sustained a wound on his head. He was wiping the blood
streaming from his face and was saying: “How will the people attain
salvation who have wounded their Prophet in the face while he was merely
calling them towards Allah?” Then Allah revealed: Not for you (O
Muhammad, but for Allah) is the decision; whether He turns in mercy to
(pardons) them or punishes them; verily, they are the Zalimoon
(polytheists, disobedients, and wrong-doers, etc.). (Soorah Aal ‘Imran
3:128)
Then Ubayy Ibn Khalaf Al-Jumahi who had sworn to kill the Prophet
approached him. Meanwhile, the Prophet had also said: “I will be the one
to kill him.” Thinking that this was the opportunity to fulfill his oath,
82

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Ubayy accosted the Prophet saying: “You liar, where are you fleeing to?!”
He pounced on the Prophet but the Prophet stabbed him slightly through
an opening in his armor and he fell down moaning like a bull. He was
carried away and they said to him: “You have only been slightly injured,
so why are you worried?” He said: Didn’t he say "I shall surely kill you?"
(since he said that) even if Rabee‘ah and Mudar were gathered, he would
kill them. He lived for only a day or two, then he died from that wound.
The rumor spread on the battlefield that Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, had been killed. Some of those who had
taken to the rocky mountain said: “Would that we can send a messenger
to ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy to obtain a peace deal on our behalf from Abu
Sufyan. O people! Muhammad has been killed, return to your people
before they come to you and slaughter you.” However, Anas Ibn An-Nadr
said: “Even if Muhammad has been killed, certainly the Lord of
Muhammad has not been killed. Fight on for the cause upon which
Muhammad was killed. O Allah, I apologize to You for what these people
are saying and I free myself from what these people have wrought.” Then
he advanced with his sword and fought till he was killed. The Messenger
of Allah continued calling the people till he climbed the mountain where
some of the Muslims had scattered. When they saw him, one of them put
his arrow in the bow and aimed it at the Prophet. He called out to them:
“I am the Messenger of Allah!” and they became elated that he is still
alive and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, was also happy to find himself in the midst of his Companions again
who would protect him. When they had gathered around the Messenger
of Allah, their anxiety dissipated and they advanced again recalling the
victory that was now slipping from their hands. They also recalled their
compatriots who had fallen. Then Allah revealed concerning their
statement that Muhammad had been killed so return to your people:
Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers
have passed away before him.(Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:144)
I say: At the outset of the battle, the Muslims were having the upper hand
over the disbelievers as Allah says: And Allah did indeed fulfill His
Promise to you when you were killing them (your enemy) with His
Permission; until (the moment) you lost your courage and fell to disputing
about the order, and disobeyed after He showed you (of the booty) which
83

In The Defence Of the True Faith
you love. Among you are some that desire this world and some that desire
the Hereafter. Then He made you flee from them (your enemy), that He
might test you. But surely, He forgave you, and Allah is Most Gracious to
the believers. (And remember) when you ran away (dreadfully) without
even casting a side glance at anyone, and the Messenger (Muhammad)
was in your rear calling you back. There did Allah give you one distress
after another. (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:152,153)
Al-Bukhari related that Al-Bara’ narrated: We confronted the polytheists
on that day (i.e. of the Battle of Uhud) and the Prophet placed a batch of
archers (at a special place) and appointed ‘Abdullah Ibn Jubair as their
commander saying, “Do not leave this place; and if you see us conquering
the enemy, do not leave this place, if you see them conquering us, do not
(come to) help us.” So, when we faced the enemy, they took to their heels
till I saw their women running toward the mountain, lifting up their clothes
from their legs, revealing their leg-bangles. The Muslims started saying,
“The booty, the booty!” ‘Abdullah Ibn Jubair said, “The Prophet has taken
a firm promise from me not to leave this place.” But his companions
refused (to stay). So when they refused (to stay there), (Allah) confused
them so that they could not know where to go, and they suffered seventy
casualties. Abu Sufyan ascended a high place and said, “Is Muhammad
present among the people?” The Prophet said, “Do not answer him.” Abu
Sufyan said, “Is the son of Abu Quhafah present among the people?” The
Prophet said, “Do not answer him.” Abu Sufyan said, “Is the son of AlKhattab among the people?” He then added, “All these people have been
killed, for, were they alive, they would have replied.” On that, ‘Umar
could not help saying, “You are a liar, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept
what will make you unhappy.” Abu Safyaan said, “Superior may be
Hubal!” On that the Prophet said (to his Companions), “Reply to him.”
They asked, “What may we say?” He said, “Say: Allah is More Elevated
and More Majestic!” Abu Sufyan said, “We have (the idol) Al‘Uzza,
whereas you have no ‘Uzza!” The Prophet said (to his Companions),
“Reply to him.” They said, “What may we say?” The Prophet said, “Say:
Allah is our Helper and you have no helper.” Abu Sufyan said, “(This)
day compensates for our loss at Badr and (in) the battle (the victory) is
always undecided and shared in turns by the belligerents. You will see
some of your dead men mutilated, but neither did I urge this action, nor
84

In The Defence Of the True Faith
am I sorry for it.” This is one of the Ahadeeth narrated by Bukhari to the
exclusion of Muslim.
Imam Ahmad related from Anas Ibn Malik that on the day of Uhud the
Prophet was left with alone seven of the Ansar and two of the Muhajiroon,
and when the polytheists attacked him, he said: “Who will repulse them
from us for the reward of Paradise?” An Ansari advanced and fought till
he was killed. Then they attacked him again and he said once again: “Who
will repulse them from us for the reward of Paradise?” till all the seven
people were killed and Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, said: “Our Companions were not fair to us.” Related by
Muslim.
Al-Bukhari related from Qais Ibn Abi Hazim who said: “I saw Talhah’s
paralyzed hand with which he had protected the Prophet (from an arrow)
in the Battle of Uhud.”
It is recorded in the Saheehain from the Hadith of Moosa Ibn Ismael from
Mu‘tamir Ibn Sulaiman from his father from Abu ‘Uthman An-Nahdi who
said: “During one of the Ghazawat in which Allah’s Messenger was
fighting, none remained with the Prophet but Talhah and Sa‘d.”
Sa‘d Ibn Abi Waqqas narrated that the Prophet took out his quiver (of
arrows) for me on the day of Uhud and said, “Throw (the arrows); let my
father and mother be sacrificed for you.” It is related by Bukhari.
It is also recorded in Saheeh Al-Bukhari that ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib narrated:
I have never heard the Prophet mentioning his father and mother for
anybody other than Sa‘d Ibn Malik. I heard him saying on the day of
Uhud, “O Sa‘d throw (arrows)! Let my father and mother be sacrificed for
you!”
It is also recorded in the Saheehain from Sa‘d Ibn Abi Waqqas who
narrated: “I saw Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, on the day of the Battle of Uhud accompanied by two men fighting
on his behalf. They were dressed in white and were fighting as bravely as
possible. I had never seen them before, nor did I see them later on.” i.e.
Jibraeel and Mikael, peace be upon them.
85

In The Defence Of the True Faith
It is also related in the Saheehain from Anas who said: “On the day of the
Battle of Uhud, the people ran away, leaving the Prophet, but Abu Talhah
was defending the Prophet from the front with his shield. Abu Talhah was
a strong, experienced archer who used to keep his arrow bow strong and
well-stretched. On that day he broke two or three arrow bows. If any man
passed by carrying a quiver full of arrows, the Prophet would say to him,
“Empty it in front of Abu Talhah.” When the Prophet started looking at
the enemy by raising his head, Abu Talhah said, “O Allah’s Prophet! Let
my parents be sacrificed for your sake! Please don’t raise your head and
make it visible, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you. Let my neck
and chest be wounded instead of yours.” (On that day) I saw ‘A'ishah, the
daughter of Abu Bakr and Umm Sulaim both lifting their dresses up so
that I was able to see the ornaments of their legs, and they were carrying
the water skins on their arms to pour the water into the mouths of the
thirsty people and then go back and fill them and come to pour the water
into the mouths of the people again. (On that day) Abu Talhah’s sword
fell from his hand twice or thrice.”
Al-Bukhari also related that Anas narrated from Abu Talhah that: I was
among those whom slumber overtook during the Battle of Uhud while we
were in the frontlines. My sword would fall from my hand and I would
pick it up, and again it would fall down and I would pick it up again.” This
is how Bukhari has mentioned it in Mu‘allaq form and with words
indicative of absolute certainty. He adduced the following statement of
Allah in corroboration: Then after the distress, He sent down security for
you. Slumber overtook a party of you, while another party was thinking
about themselves (as how to save their ownselves, ignoring the others and
the Prophet) and thought wrongly of Allah - the thought of ignorance.
They said, “Have we any part in the affair?” Say you (O Muhammad):
“Indeed the affair belongs wholly to Allah.” They hide within themselves
what they dare not reveal to you, saying: “If we had anything to do with
the affair, none of us would have been killed here.” Say: “Even if you had
remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would
certainly have gone forth to the place of their death,” but that Allah might
test what is in your breasts; and to Mahhis that which was in your hearts
(sins), and Allah is All-Knower of what is in (your) breasts. Those of you
who turned back on the day the two hosts met (i.e. the Battle of Uhud), it
was Shaitan (Satan) who caused them to backslide (run away from the
86

In The Defence Of the True Faith
battlefield) because of some (sins) they had earned. But Allah, indeed, has
forgiven them. Surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing. (Soorah
Aal ‘Imran 3: 154,155)
Al-Bukhari related that ‘Uthman Ibn Mawhab narrated: A man came to
perform the Hajj to (Allah’s) House. Seeing some people sitting, he said,
“Who are these sitting people?” Somebody said, “They are the people of
Quraish.” He said, “Who is the old man?” They said, “Ibn ‘Umar.” He
went to him and said, “I want to ask you about something; will you tell
me about it? I ask you with the respect due to the sanctity of this (Sacred)
House, do you know that ‘Uthman Ibn ‘Affan fled on the day of Uhud.”
Ibn ‘Umar said, “Yes.” He said, “Do you know that he (i.e. ‘Uthman) was
absent from the Badr (battle) and did not join it?” Ibn ‘Umar said, “Yes.”
He said, “Do you know that he failed to be present at the Ridwan Pledge
of allegiance (i.e. Pledge of allegiance at Hudaibiyyah) and did not
witness it?” Ibn ‘Umar replied, “Yes,” He then said, “Allahu-Akbar!” Ibn
‘Umar said, “Come along; I will inform you and explain to you what you
have asked. As for the flight (of ‘Uthman) on the day of Uhud, I testify
that Allah forgave him. As regards his absence from the Badr (battle), he
was married to the daughter of Allah’s Messenger and she was ill, so the
Prophet said to him, ‘You will have the same reward as a man who has
fought in Badr, and you will also have the same share from the booty.’ As
for his absence from the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance, if there had been
anybody more respected by the Makkans than ‘Uthman Ibn ‘Affan, the
Prophet would surely have sent that man instead of ‘Uthman. So the
Prophet sent him (i.e. ‘Uthman to Makkah) and the Ridwan Pledge of
allegiance took place after ‘Uthman had gone to Makkah. The Prophet
raised his right hand saying. ‘This is the hand of ‘Uthman,’ and clapped it
over his other hand and said, “This is for ‘Uthman.’ ” Ibn ‘Umar then said
(to the man), “Go now, after taking this information.”
The bottom line is that many of the events that occurred in Badr also
occurred in Uhud from them are: the slumber which occurred at the time
of the clash. This is an evidence of the tranquility of the heart by the help
of Allah and His strengthening. We have commented on the statement of
Allah in our discussion on the Battle of Badr: (Remember) when He
covered you with a slumber as a security from Him... (Soorah Al-Anfal
8:11) and here too Allah says: Then after the distress, He sent down
87

In The Defence Of the True Faith
security for you. Slumber overtook a party of you... (Soorah Aal ‘Imran
3:154)
Ibn Ma‘sood said: “Slumber during battle is from Eeman and slumber
during the course of Salat is from Nifaq (hypocrisy).” This is why he said
thereafter: ...another party was thinking about themselves (as how to save
their ownselves, ignoring the others and the Prophet)... (Soorah Aal
‘Imran 3:154)
Similarly, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, sought victory on the day of Uhud just like in Badr with his words:
“O Allah! If You wish (to destroy the believers) You will never be
worshipped after today” as related by Imam Ahmad from Anas Ibn Malik
who narrated that Allah’s Messenger, peace be upon him, used to say on
the Day of Uhud: “O Allah! If You wish (to destroy the believers) You
will never be worshipped after today”
Al-Bukhari related that Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah narrated: On the day of the
Battle of Uhud, a man came to the Prophet and said, “Can you tell me
where I will be if I should get martyred?” The Prophet replied, “In
Paradise.” The man threw away some dates he was carrying in his hand,
and fought till he was martyred.

The Polytheists Whom the Prophet Confronted on
That Day
Al-Bukhari related from Hammam Ibn Munabbih who heard Abu
Hurairah narrate concerning the injury the Prophet sustained in the Battle
of Uhud that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said: “The anger of Allah is intensified on a people who did this to
His Messenger (pointing to his inscissors) and the anger of Allah is
heightened on a man killed by a Messenger of Allah while fighting in the
path of Allah.”
Ahmad related that Anas narrated that Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said on the day of Uhud while blood
streamed down his face: “How will the people attain salvation when they
have wounded their Prophet in the face while he was merely calling them
88

In The Defence Of the True Faith
towards Allah?” Then Allah revealed: Not for you (O Muhammad, but for
Allah) is the decision; whether He turns in mercy to (pardons) them or
punishes them; verily, they are the Zalimoon (polytheists, disobedients,
and wrongdoers, etc.). (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:128)”
Al-Bukhari related on the authority Abu Hazim who heard Sahl Ibn Sa‘d
being asked about the injury which the Messenger of Allah sustained on
the day of the Battle of Uhud. He said: “By Allah, I know who washed
the wounds of Allah’s Messenger, who poured water (for washing them),
and with what he was treated.” Sahl added, “Fatimah, the daughter of
Allah’s Messenger used to wash the wounds, and ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib used
to pour water from a shield. When Fatimah saw that the water aggravated
the bleeding, she took a piece of a mat, burned it, and inserted its ashes
into the wound so that the blood was congealed (and the bleeding
stopped). His canine tooth was broken on that day, his face was wounded,
and his helmet was broken on his head.”
‘A’ishah, the Mother of Believers, narrated that whenever Abu Bakr
remembered the day of Uhud, he would say, “All of that day was for
Talhah.” Then he would begin to recount his experience: I was the first to
return on the day of Uhud and I saw a man fighting strenuously to protect
the Messenger of Allah.
“During the Day of Uhud the Prophet, peace be upon him, was left alone
and I was the first to go back to him. In front of him I saw a man fighting
to shield him from the enemy. I said to myself: ‘I wish he were Talhah.
Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. (O Allah) Let him be
Talhah!’ On the way, I was overtaken by Abu ‘Ubaidah Ibn Al-Jarrah,
who was then moving as swiftly as a bird. We both rushed to dress the
Prophet’s wounds. There we found Talhah suffering from serious wounds
before the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him.
The Prophet said: ‘See to your brother. His deed entitled him for an abode
in Paradise.’ I noticed that two rings of the iron-ringed helmet had
penetrated the Prophet’s cheek. So I set out to take them out, but Abu
‘Ubaidah demanded: ‘By Allah, O Abu Bakr I beseech you, let me do it
myself.’ Fearing to hurt the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, he started pulling one of the two rings out very slowly and carefully
with his mouth. Then he pulled the arrow out by his mouth, too.
89

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Consequently, his front tooth fell. Then I proceeded to pull the second out;
but Abu ‘Ubaidah besought me to leave it: ‘O, Abu Bakr, I adjure you by
Allah to let me do it.’ He pulled the second ring very slowly and carefully
with his mouth - till it came out. When we finished attending to the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, we
approached Talhah to tend to him and found that he had some ten swordstrokes on his body. (This showed how efficiently Talhah had fought and
struggled on that day).”
It is more beloved to me that he was a man from my own people.
Meanwhile, between me and the polytheists was a man whom I do not
know. I was much closer to the Messenger of Allah than him but he moved
so swiftly that I could not catch up with him. Alas, he was Abu Ubaidah
Ibn Al-Jarrah. So both of us got to the Messenger of Allah and found out
that his inscissors had been broken and his face had been gashed and two
rings of the iron-ringed helmet had penetrated his cheek. The Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Take care of
your companion,” indicating Talhah who had been exhausted and
bleeding profusely. We did not pay attention to what he said. I made an
attempt to extract the ring from his face and Abu ‘Ubaidah said: “I adjure
you by the right that I have (over you), leave it for me.” So, I left it for
him. He attempted to remove it with his hand but that was painful for the
Messenger of Allah so he applied his teeth and gently removed the first
ring but one of his inscissors came out with it.
I made an attempt to remove the second as I did previously but again Abu
‘Ubaidah said: “I adjure you by the right that I have (over you), leave it
for me,” and again, I left it for him. He repeated what he did the first time
and his second inscissor also fell off with the second ring. Abu ‘Ubaidah
turned out to be one of the most handsome of men with gapped teeth.
When he finished taking care of Allah’s Messenger, we came to Talhah
in one of the pits and on his body were about seventy injuries from
stabbing, shots (from arrows) and cuts (from swords) and one of his
fingers had also been amputated. So we tended to him as well.
When ‘Abdullah Ibn Qami‘ah had inflicted that injury on the Messenger
of Allah, he retreated while he was triumphantly exclaiming: “I have
killed Muhammad.” Then Shaytan cried out in piercing voice that traveled
90

In The Defence Of the True Faith
wide on that day: “Finally, Muhammad has been killed!” The Muslims
felt extremely confused and many of them took the news as a fact. They
became resolved to fight the siege against Islam until they die upon what
the Messenger of Allah had died. Among those who had that resolve was
Anas Ibn An-Nadr and others who shall be mentioned later.
Moreover, Allah revealed a consolation regarding this (i.e. the Prophet’s
death) that this even would actually to occur. Allah says: Muhammad is
no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed
away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your
heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least
harm will he do to Allah, and Allah will give reward to those who are
grateful. And no person can ever die except by Allah’s Leave and at an
appointed term. And whoever desires a reward in (this) world, We shall
give him of it; and whoever desires a reward in the Hereafter, We shall
give him thereof. And We shall reward the grateful. And many a Prophet
(i.e. many from amongst the Prophets) fought (in Allah’s Cause) and
along with him (fought) large bands of religious learned men. But they
never lost heart for that which did befall them in Allah’s Way, nor did
they weaken nor degrade themselves. And Allah loves As-Sabireen (the
patient ones, etc.) And they said nothing but: “Our Lord! Forgive us our
sins and our transgressions (in keeping our duties to You), establish our
feet firmly, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk.” So Allah gave
them the reward of this world, and the excellent reward of the Hereafter.
And Allah loves Al-Muhsinoon (the good-doers). O you who believe! If
you obey those who disbelieve, they will send you back on your heels,
and you will turn back (from Faith) as losers. Nay, Allah is your Mawla
(Patron, Lord, Helper and Protector, etc.), and He is the Best of helpers.
We shall cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve, because they
joined others in worship with Allah, for which He had sent no authority;
their abode will be the Fire and how evil is the abode of the Zalimoon.
(Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:144-151)
We have summarized its explanation in our Tafseer, to Allah belong
all Praise.
Abu Bakr As-Siddiq addressed the people in his first role after the death
of the Messenger of Allah. He said: “O people, whoever worships
91

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead but whoever worships Allah,
certainly Allah is Alive and He will never die,” then he recited this verse:
Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers
have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn
back on your heels (as disbelievers)? (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3: 144)
It was as if the people had never heard this verse before till Abu Bakr
recited it and everybody began to recite it as well.
Ahmad related that Anas Ibn An-Nadr did not witness the Battle of Badr
with the Prophet and it was burdensome for him. So he said: “I was absent
in the first battle ever fought by the Messenger of Allah. If Allah lets me
witness another battle alongside the Messenger of Allah, I am going to
prove my courage.” He witnessed the Battle of Uhud alongside the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. Sa‘d Ibn
Mu‘adh approached him and Anas said to him: “O Abu ‘Amr, where are
you going? Look, I can perceive the scent of Paradise before Uhud.” He
fought against the disbelievers until he was killed. He was found with
about eighty wounds on his body from stabs, shots (from arrows) and cuts
(from swords), His sister, Amati Ar-Rubayyi‘ Bint An-Nadr said, “I could
only recognize my brother from his fingertips.” This Verse was revealed:
Among the Believers are men who have been true to their covenant with
Allah [i.e. they have gone out for Jihad (holy fighting), and showed not
their backs to the disbelievers], of them some have fulfilled their
obligations (i.e. have been martyred), and some of them are still waiting,
but they have never changed [i.e. they never proved treacherous to their
covenant which they concluded with Allah] in the least. (Soorah AlAhzab 33:23) They opined that it was revealed concerning him and his
compatriots. Related by Muslim
Al-Bukhari related that Abul-Waleed narrated from Shu‘bah from Ibn
Munkadir who said: I heard Jabir say: “When my father was martyred, I
started weeping and uncovering his face. The Companions of the Prophet
stopped me from doing so but the Prophet did not stop me. Then the
Prophet said, ‘(O Jabir) don’t weep over him, (or, what makes him weep?)
for the angels kept on shading him with their wings till his body was
lifted.”
92

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Bukhari also related that once a meal was brought to ‘Abdur-Rahmaan
Ibn ‘Awf while he was fasting. He said, “Mus‘ab Ibn ‘Umair was
martyred, and he was better than me, yet he was shrouded in a Burdah (i.e.
a sheet) so that, if his head was covered, his feet became naked, and if his
feet were covered, his head became naked.” ‘Abdur-Rahman added,
“Hamzah was martyred and he was better than me. Then worldly wealth
was bestowed upon us and we were given from it too much. We are afraid
that the rewards of our deeds have been given to us in this life.” ‘AbdurRahman then started weeping so much till the food became cold. AlBukhari related it exclusively.
Al-Bukhari related that Khabbab Ibn Al-Aratt said: We migrated with the
Prophet seeking Allah’s Countenance, so our rewards became due and
sure with Allah. Some of us passed away without receiving anything of
their rewards in this world. One of these was Mus‘ab Ibn ‘Umair who was
martyred on the day of the Battle of Uhud. We did not find anything with
which to shroud his body except a striped cloak. When we covered his
head with it, his feet remained uncovered, and when we covered his feet
with it, his head remained uncovered. So Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered us to cover his head with it and
put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over his feet. And there are some
among us whose fruits have ripened and they are collecting them (i.e. they
have received their rewards in this world).” The rest of the group related
it except Ibn Majah.
Al-Bukhari related that ‘A’ishah said: “On the day (of the Battle) of Uhud
when the polytheists were defeated, Iblees shouted, “O slaves of Allah!
Beware of the forces at your back,” and on that the Muslims of the front
files fought with the Muslims of the back files (thinking they were
polytheists). Hudhaifah looked back to see his father “Al-Yaman,” (being
attacked by the Muslims). He shouted, “O Allah’s Slaves! My father! My
father!” By Allah, they did not stop till they killed him.” Hudhaifah said,
“May Allah forgive you.” ‘Urwah said that Hudhaifah continued to do
good (invoking Allah to forgive the killer of his father till he met Allah,
i.e. died).”
Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah narrated that Qatadah Ibn Nu‘man’s eye was knocked
out in the Battle of Uhud until the it hang down his cheek and Allah’s
93

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, restored it and it
turned out to be the better and sharper of his two eyes, even when the other
eye was sore, the restored one remained healthy.
This is why when his son came to the presence of ‘Umar Ibn ‘AbdulAzeez, he asked him: “Who are you?” and he responded to him
extemporaneously:
I am the son of he whose eye hung down his cheek
And it was restored by the hand of Al-Mustafa (the chosen) in the best of
restoration
Then it went back to its previous condition
It was the better eye and how good did the knocked eye turn
Ibn Hisham related: Umm Umarah Naseebah Bint Ka‘b Al-Maziniyyah
also fought in the Battle of Uhud. Sa‘eed Ibn Abi Zaid Al-Ansari
mentioned that Umm Sa‘d Bint Sa‘d Ibn Rabee‘ used to say, I visited
Umm Umarah and I said to her: “O maternal aunt, narrate to me your
story.” She said, “I went out in the early morning to find out what the
Muslims had done (in the battle) and with me was a bucket full of water.
I went to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, while he was in the midst of his Companions. When the Muslims
were routed, I took position by the Prophet and began to fight to repulse
(the enemy) away from him. I was shot by an arrow which injured me.”
(The narrator added): I saw on her shoulder a cavity of injury and I asked
her: “Who inflicted you with this injury?” She replied: “Ibn Qami’ah, may
Allah humiliate him. When the people fled from around the Prophet, he
approached me saying ‘Point Muhammad to me, I will not be successful
if he escapes.’ So, I, Mus‘ab Ibn ‘Umair and a couple of people who
remained steadfast with the Messenger of Allah accosted him and he dealt
me a blow which gave me this injury. Meanwhile, I had also dealt him
several blows, but the enemy of Allah was wearing two layers of armor.”
Ibn Ishaq related: Once, Anas Ibn An-Nadr, Anas Ibn Malik’s uncle, came
to ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab and Talhah Ibn ‘Ubaidullah among a group of
people consisting of the Muhajiroon and the Ansar while they were
94

In The Defence Of the True Faith
downcast, so he asked them: “Why are you sitting here?” They responded:
“The Messenger of Allah has been killed.” Then he said: “So, what will
you do with your life after him? Stand up and fight (till you are killed) for
the same cause upon which the Messenger of Allah died.” So he plunged
into the battle and fought till he was killed. It was after him that Anas Ibn
Malik was named.
Ibn Ishaq related that the first person to recognize the Prophet after the
defeat and the false claim by the people that Allah’s Messenger had been
killed, according to what I was informed of, was Ka‘b Ibn Malik. He said:
“I saw his eyes shining under the helmet, so I shouted at the top of my
voice: ‘O Muslims, good news, here is Allah’s Messenger!’ but Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, indicated to me to
keep quiet.
Ibn Ishaq added: Saleh Ibn Ibrahim Ibn ‘Abdur-Rahman Ibn ‘Awf
narrated to me that whenever Ubayy Ibn Khalaf met the Messenger of
Allah, peace be upon him, in Makkah, he would say: O Muhammad, I
have a horse which I feed a farak of sorghum everyday, I will kill you
while riding on it. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, would respond: “Rather, I will be the one to kill you by the
wish of Allah.” When he returned to the Quraish after he had been
scratched very slightly and the blood congealed, he said: “By Allah,
Muhammad has killed me.” The people said to him: “By Allah, you have
lost your mind, you have only been injured slightly.” He responded to
them: “He used to tell me in Makkah: ‘I will be the one to kill you’ and
by Allah even if he spat on me, it would kill me.” The enemy of Allah
died at Saraf while he was being carried back to Makkah.
Ibn Ishaq said that while the Messenger of Allah was at a section of the
battlefield with a group of his Companions (which remained with him) a
company of the Quraish appeared on a hill overlooking the Muslims. Ibn
Hisham added that among them was Khalid Ibn Waleed. Ibn Ishaq
continues: Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said: “O Allah, it is not fitting that they should be above us.” ‘Umar and
a company of the Muhajiroon with him fought them until the Quraish were
dislodged from the hill. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessing of
Allah be upon him, then attempted to climb a boulder but was unable to
95

In The Defence Of the True Faith
due to aging. The Messenger of Allah peace be upon him, also had on him
two armors. Then Talhah Ibn ‘Ubaidullah crouched underneath him so
that the Prophet peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was lifted on
his back until he climbed the boulder.
Yahya Ibn ‘Abbad Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn Az-Zubair narrated to me from his
father from ‘Abdullah Ibn AzZubair from Az-Zubair who said: I heard
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, say on that
day: "awjaba Talhah" (i.e Paradise has become compulsory for him) due
to that action of his.
Imam Ahmad related from Abu Hurairah that we witnessed the Battle of
Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, and he (Allah’s Messenger) said about a man who claimed to
be a Muslim: “This man is from the inmates of Hellfire.” When fighting
ensued, the man fought strenuously and he was injured. Someone said: “O
Messenger of Allah, the man whom you said is from the inmates of
Hellfire fought bravely today and was killed.” Yet the Prophet said:
“Sailing to Hellfire.” The people were almost nursing some doubts in their
minds at the insistence of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him. While the situation remained as such, someone said:
“The man is not dead yet but he has sustained a very serious wound.”
When it was nightfall, the man could no longer bear the excruciating pain
from his injury so he killed himself. When the Messenger of Allah, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, was informed of that, he said: “Allah
is Greatest, I bear witness that I am a slave of Allah and His Messenger.”
Then he ordered Bilal to announce that people should congregate. After
they gathered, the Messenger of Allah said: “Certainly, no one will enter
Paradise except a soul which has truly submitted to Allah and that Allah
will aid this religion even with a sinful person.”
Ibn Ishaq related that Abu Hurairah used to say: “Inform me about the
man who entered Paradise even though he never offered a single Salat
(prayer).” When no one among the audience knew who it was, they asked
him. He said: “Al-Usairim Banu ‘Abdul Ashhal ‘Amr Ibn Thabit Ibn
Waqsh.” Al-Husain said: So I said to Mahmood Ibn Labeed, “How was
the matter of Al-Usairim?” He said: He used to object to his people
accepting Islam. However, when it was the day of the Battle of Uhud, it
96

In The Defence Of the True Faith
occurred to him and he accepted Islam. He took his sword and advanced
in the battle till he entered deep in the thick of warriors. He fought
valiantly till he was mortally wounded. At the close of the battle, some
men of the Banu ‘Abdul-Ashhal were scouting the battlefield for their
fallen men they found him. They said: “By Allah, this is Usairim, what
has brought him here? We had left him behind while he was still finding
this speech (i.e. Islam) objectionable.” So they asked him: “What has
brought you, O ‘Amr? Is it your compassion toward your people (which
brought you to the battlefield) or a genuine desire for Islam?” He said:
“Rather, a genuine quest for Islam. I have believed in Allah and His
Messenger and I have accepted Islam, then I took my sword and advanced
alongside Allah’s Messenger and I fought till I sustained what I am
currently experiencing.” Shortly, thereafter, he died in their hands. They
mentioned the incident to Allah’s Messenger and he said: “He is from the
inmates of Paradise.”
Ibn Ishaq related that my father narrated to me from some elders of Banu
Salimah who said: ‘Amr Ibn AlJamooh was lame and disable and he had
four youthful sons who fought like lions on the battlefield whenever they
would accompany the Messenger of Allah on his battles. When
preparations were being made for Uhud, he wanted to go, but his sons said
to him: “Allah has given you a concession, so stay at home and we shall
go in your place.” ‘Amr came to the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, and said: “These sons of mine are
preventing me from participating in Jihad with you. By Allah, I hope to
trot in Paradise with this lame leg of mine.” The Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “As for you, Allah has
excused you and Jihad is not compulsory on you.” Then he turned to the
sons and said: “What if you allowed him, perhaps Allah may grant him
martyrdom?” They did and he went to the battle and he was killed in the
Battle of Uhud. May Allah be pleased him.

Ibn Ishaq said: It was related to me by Saleh Ibn Kaisani, Hind and the
other women with her began to mutilate the coprses of the Muslim
martyrs. They went round cutting the ears and noses of the Companions
of Allah’s Messenger till they made necklaces and anklets out of their
noses. She gave her bangles and necklaces to her slave, Wahshi. Then she
97

In The Defence Of the True Faith
ripped open Hamzah’s liver, chewed it; but finding it unpleasant, she spat
it out. However, Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah mentioned that it was Wahshi who
ripped open Hamzah’s liver and he took it to Hind who chewed it but she
found it difficult to swallow. And Allah knows best.
Ibn Ishaq said that when Abu Sufyan wanted to leave the battlefield, he
approached the mountain and shouted at the top of his voice: “I have been
compensated. War alternates. A day for the day of Badr. Exalted be
Hubal!” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said to ‘Umar: “Stand up ‘Umar, and give him a fitting reply. Say to
him: ‘Allah is more Exalted and Sublime. Your dead are in the Fire!’”
‘Umar acted as ordered and Abu Sufyan said: “Come down to me,
‘Umar!” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said: “Go to him and see what he wants.” ‘Umar went and Abu
Sufyan said to him: “I beseech you by God, have we killed Muhammad?”
‘Umar replied: “By Allah, no. He can hear what you say at this moment.”
Abu Sufyan said: “You are more truthful and sincere to me than Ibn
Qami’ah.” Then he shouted: “There has been some mutilation of your
dead. By Allah, I am neither pleased by it nor angry by it, and I neither
forbade nor odered it.” When Abu Sufyan turned to go away, he shouted:
“Your rendezvous is Badr next year.”
Ibn Ishaq said: Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, then sent ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib, saying: “Go after them and see what
they are doing. If they leave the horses aside and ride the camels, then
they are heading for Makkah. However, if they ride the horses and drive
the camels, then their destination is Madinah. By Him in Whose Hands is
my life, if they head for Madinah, I shall march upon them and fight them
within its walls. ‘Ali said: “So I went after them and saw that they had left
the horses aside and were riding the camels in the direction of Makkah.”

The Du‘a of the Prophet After the Battle of Uhud
Imam Ahmad related that Ibn Rifa‘ah Az-Zuraqi narrated from his father
who said: On the day of Uhud when the polytheists were repelled, the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Arrange yourselves in rows so that I may praise my Lord, to Whom is
Glory.” They arranged themselves behind him in rows and he supplicated:
98

In The Defence Of the True Faith
“O Allah to You belongs all Praise. O Allah, no one can withhold what
You have let loose and no one can let loose what you have withheld. No
one can guide the one Whom You leave astray and no one can misguide
the one Whom You have guided. No one can prevent what You choose to
give and no one can give what You prevent. No one can bring close the
one Who You have distanced and no one can distance the one whom You
have brought close. O Allah, bestow upon us Your blessings, mercy,
bounty and provision.
“O Allah, verily I ask of You the everlasting bliss, which never grows
stale nor vanishes. O Allah, I seek Your aid on the day of poverty, and
Your security on the day of fear. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the
evil of what You have bestowed on us and what You have not bestowed.
O Allah, make faith beloved to us and make it beautiful in our hearts, and
make disbelief hateful to us, as well as sin and disobedience, and count us
among the upright ones. O Allah, make us die as Muslims and resurrect
us as Muslims and admit us among the righteous, neither disgraced nor
beguiled. O Allah, fight the disbelievers who deceive Your messengers
and deter others from Your Way, and send upon them punishment and
chastisement. O Allah, fight the disbelievers who have been given the
Scripture, O God of Truth.”
Ibn Ishaq related that Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Abdur-Rahman Ibn
Abi Sa‘sa‘ah Al-Mazini, the brother of Banu Najjar, narrated to me that
when the people finished recounting their dead, the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said (i.e. after the conclusion
of the Battle of Uhud): “Who will check for me what happened to Sa‘d
Ibn Ar-Rabee‘, is he among the dead or the living?” A man from the Ansar
said: “I will do that.” So he went round all the martyrs of the battle until
he found Sa‘d mortally wounded and in the throes of death. So he said to
him: “O Sa‘d! Allah’s Messenger ordered me to check whether you are
among the dead or among the living?” Then he said, “Certainly I am
among the dead. When you get to the Messenger of Allah, say to him:
‘Sa‘d is saying may Allah reward you for me greater than any Prophet is
ever rewarded on behalf of his community. Convey my salam to your
people and say to them: ‘Sa‘d is saying to you: verily there is no excuse
for you in the presence of Allah if they find access to your Prophet while
99

In The Defence Of the True Faith
you have eyes...” He did not recover till he died, then I came to Allah’s
Messenger to inform him of his fate.
Ibn Ishaq related that according to what reached me, the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, searched for the corpse
of Hamzah Ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib and found him in the middle of the valley
with his stomach ripped and his liver taken out. His corpse had been
mutilated. His nose and ears were cut off. Muhammad Ibn Ja‘afar Ibn AzZubair narrated to me that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said when he saw the spectacle: “Were it not that it
would grieve Safiyyah and I fear that it would become a practice after me,
I would have left his corpse to be eaten by wild animals and birds of prey
and if Allah makes us confront the Quraish in another battle I shall
severely deal with thirty of their men.” When the Muslims saw the grief
and anger of Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, over what had been done to his uncle, they said: “If Allah grants us
victory over them at another time, we shall severely punish them in a
manner that is unprecedented among the Arabs.”
Ibn Ishaq related: Buraidah Ibn Sufyan Ibn Farwah Al-Aslami narrated to
me from Muhammad Ibn Ka‘b that Ibn ‘Abbas said concerning the
statement of Allah: And if you punish (your enemy, O you Believers in
the Oneness of Allah), then punish them with the like of that with which
you were afflicted. But if you endure patiently, verily, it is better for AsSabireen (the patient ones, etc.) And endure you patiently (O
Muhammad), your patience is not but from Allah. (Soorah An-Nahl
16:126,127)
Then Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
refrained and chose to be patient and forbade torturing.
I says: This Verse is Makkan and the event of Uhud occurred three years
after the Hijrah, so how could it be connected with this? And Allah (SWT)
knows best.
Imam Ahmad related that ‘Urwah said: My father, Az-Zubair narrated to
me that on the day of Uhud, a woman approached swiftly till she almost
got close to the corpses. The Prophet detested that she should see them,
100

In The Defence Of the True Faith
so he said: “The woman! The woman!!” Az-Zubair said: “I checked and
found out that she was my aunt, Safiyyah. So I ran toward her and caught
her before she got to the corpses. She hit me on the chest and she was a
resilient woman.” She said: Go away from me (otherwise) I shall not be
pleased with you.” So I said to her: “Allah’s Messenger has forbidden
you.” Then she stopped and brought out two clothes with her and said: “I
have brought these two clothes for my brother, Hamzah. I have been
informed of his death, so bury him in them.” Then we brought the two
clothes to shroud Hamzah. However, by his side was an Ansari who had
met a similar fate as Hamzah. We found it a detraction and shameful to
shroud Hamzah in two clothes while the Ansari is buried without a shroud.
So we said: give one shroud to Hamzah and the other to the Ansari. So we
shared it. One was bigger than the other. We measured both of them and
gave to each the cloth that is commensurate.

Funeral Prayer Over Hamzah and the Other Martyrs
of Uhud
Ibn Ishaq related that Ibn ‘Abbas narrated: “The Messenger of Allah
called for the corpse of Hamzah and he was brought enshrouded in a
Burdah, then he offered the funeral prayer on him making in it seven
takbeerat. Then, the remainder of the martyrs were brought and he offered
the prayer over them one after the other along with Hamzah till he offered
the prayer seventy-two times on Hamzah alone.” This narration is strange
and its chain is weak.
The one related by Al-Bukhari is perhaps more established. ‘AbdurRahman Ibn Ka‘b Ibn Malik narrated that Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah informed
him that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, shrouded every two martyrs of Uhud in one piece of cloth and then
he would ask, “Which of them knew more of the Qur’an?” When one of
them was pointed out he would put him first in the grave, he said, “I am a
witness on these.” Then he ordered them to be buried with blood on their
bodies. Neither did he offer their funeral prayer nor did he get them
washed.”
Ahmad relegated that Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah narrated that Allah’s
Messenger, peace be upon him, said concerning the martyrs of Uhud:
101

In The Defence Of the True Faith
“Verily every wound – or every blood – will emit the scent of musk on
the Day of Judgment.” And he did not offer funeral prayer on them.
It is also established that he offered the prayer on them several years after
and shortly before his death. ‘Uqbah Ibn ‘Amir said: Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, offered prayer on the martyrs
of Uhud eight years after their death as if bidding farewell to the living
and the dead, then he ascended the pulpit and said, “I am your predecessor
before you, and I am a witness over you, and your promised place to meet
me will be Al-Hawd (i.e. the pond) (on the Day of Resurrection), and I
am (now) looking at it from this place of mine. I am not afraid that you
will worship others besides Allah, but I am afraid that worldly life will
tempt you and cause you to vie with each other for it.” That was the last
look which I cast on Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him.
Ibn Ishaq related that when Safiyyah approached to have a look at him
(i.e. Hamzah’s corpse), he was her full brother, the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to her son, AzZubair Ibn
Al-‘Awwam: “Go and stop her so that she does not see what has befallen
her brother.” He (Az-Zubair) said: “O my mother, the Messenger of Allah
commands you to turn back.” “Why?” She asked. “The news has reached
me that my brother has been mutilated and since that is in the path of
Allah, whatever results from that we shall expect Allah’s reward for that
and we shall be patient if Allah wills.” When Az-Zubair came to the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, to inform
him of what she said, the Prophet said: “Let her go.” So she went and look
at her brother and prayed over him and she said the istirja‘ (i.e. from Allah
we came and to Him is our return) and she sought Allah’s forgiveness.
Ibn Ishaq also related from Az-Zuhri from ‘Abdullah Ibn Tha‘labah Ibn
Su’air that when Allah’s Messenger peace be upon him, came upon the
martyrs of Uhud, he said: “I am a witness over these people. Whatever
wound one sustains sustains in Allah’s cause will appear on the Day of
Resurrection as it was at the time of infliction; blood will be flowing from
the wound and its color will be that of the blood but will smell like musk.”

102

In The Defence Of the True Faith
He (Ibn Ishaq) also added: My uncle, Moosa Ibn Yasar narrated to me that
he heard Abu Hurairah say: Abul-Qasim said, “A wound which a Muslim
receives in Allah’s cause will appear on the Day of Resurrection as it was
at the time of infliction; blood will be flowing from the wound and its
color will be that of the blood but will smell like musk.” Another version
of this Hadith is cited in the Saheehain.
Hisham Ibn ‘Amir narrated that the Ansar came to the Messenger of Allah,
peace be upon him, on the day of Uhud and said: “We have been afflicted
with wound and fatigue. What do you command us? He said: ‘Dig graves,
make them wide, bury two or three in a single grave.’ He was asked:
‘Which of them should be put first?’ He replied: ‘The one who knew the
Qur’an most’.” A similar Hadith is reported from AthThawri from
Ayyoob from Humaid Ibn Hilal from Hisham Ibn ‘Amir with the addition:
“and make it deep (i.e. the grave)”
Imam Ahmad narrated from Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah that some of the martyrs
of Uhud were transported from the place of their death, but the announcer
of the Prophet announced that they be returned to their places of death.
Abu Dawood and An-Nasa’i have also related it from the Hadith of AthThawri.
Ahmad related from Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah who said: “When Allah’s
Messenger went out of Madinah to fight the polytheists my father said to
me: ‘O Jabir, never mind that you are on watch for the people of Madinah
till you find out the turn of our fate. If not that I am leaving behind for you
my daughters (to cater for), it would have been more pleasing to me that
you fight in my front.” Jabir continued: “I was still among the watch when
my paternal aunt arrived with the remains of my father and my maternal
uncle ferrying them on the back of a camel. She brought them to Madinah
in order to bury them in our graveyard. Then a man came and announced:
“Take heed! The Prophet is ordering you to return the martyrs and bury
them where they were killed.” So we took them back and buried them at
the spot where they were killed. During the reign of Mu‘awiyyah Ibn Abi
Sufyan, a man came to me and said: “O Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah, some of
Mu‘awiyyah’s workers have tampered with your father’s grave and a part
of his body is exposed.” I came to find his body in the same shape as when
I had buried him, without disintegrating the least, except for (a slight
103

In The Defence Of the True Faith
amount) that a dead person or a martyr would be unable to escape. So I
buried him again.”
Al-Bukhari related from Ata’ from Jabir who said: When the time of the
Battle of Uhud approached, my father called me at night and said, “I think
that I will be the first amongst the companions of the Prophet to be
martyred. I do not leave anyone after me dearer to me than you, except
Allah’s Messenger’s soul and I owe some debt and you should repay it
and treat your sisters favorably (nicely and politely).” So in the morning
he was the first to be martyred and was buried along with another (martyr).
I did not like to leave him with the other (martyr) so I took him out of the
grave after six months of his burial and he was in the same condition as
he was on the day of burial, except a slight change near his ear.”
It is recorded in the Saheehain from Jabir that when his father was
martyred he kept uncovering his face and weeping, but the people (i.e. the
Companions of the Prophet) forbade him to do this, whereupon Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “You may
weep or you may not weep; the angels did not cease to provide him shade
with their wings until you lift him (to be buried in the grave).”
‘A'ishah also narrated that Allah’s Messenger peace be upon him, said to
Jabir: “O Jabir, shouldn’t I give you a glad tiding?” Jabir replied "Yes."
So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said: “I am aware that Allah brought your father back to life and said to
him: 'Let my slave wish for anything he desire and I shall grant it for you.'
He replied: ‘My Lord, I worshipped You in the true sense. I desire that
You return to me to the world so that I may fight alongside Your Prophet
and so that I may be killed for Your sake once again.'” Allah then said: “I
have previously decreed that no one (who died) will return (to the world).”
Abu Hurairah narrated that the Prophet visited the graves of the martyrs.
When he came to a pass, he said: “Salamun ‘Alaikum (peace be upon you)
for that you persevered in patience! Excellent indeed is the final home.”
After the demise of the Prophet, Abu Bakr would do the same thing.
‘Umar also would do the same thing after Abu Bakr and ‘Uthman also
followed ‘Umar’s practice.
104

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Masrooq narrated: We asked ‘Abdullah Ibn Mas‘ood concerning this
Verse: Think not of those who are killed in the Way of Allah as dead. Nay,
they are alive, with their Lord, and they have provision.(Soorah Aal
‘Imran 3:169) He responded: “As for us, we asked the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, concerning that and he
said: “The souls, of the martyrs live in the bodies of green birds who have
their nests in chandeliers hung from the throne of the Almighty. They eat
the fruits of Paradise from wherever they like and then nestle in these
chandeliers. Once their Lord cast a glance at them and said: ‘Do you want
anything?’ They said: ‘What more shall we desire? We eat the fruit of
Paradise from wherever we like.’ Their Lord asked them the same
question thrice. When they saw that they will continue to be asked and not
left (without answering the question). They said: ‘O Lord, we wish that
You return our souls to our bodies so that we may be slain in Your way
once again. When He (Allah) saw that they had no need except this, they
were left (to their joy in heaven).”

The Numbers of the Martyrs
Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah said: The aggregate of the Ansar and the Muhajiroon
who were martyred in the Battle of Uhud was forty-nine men. It is
recorded in the authentic Hadith related by Al-Bukhari from Al-Bara’ that
the dead among the Muslims (in that battle) numbered seventy men.
Qatadah narrated that Anas said that: seventy Ansar were martyred in the
Battle of Uhud, seventy in the incident of Bi’r Ma‘oonah and seventy in
the Battle of Yamamah.
Moosa narrated: On that day, sixteen of the polytheists were killed.
‘Urwah, however, put the number of their dead at nineteen while Ibn Ishaq
said they were twenty-two.
Rabee’ narrated that Ash-Shafi’i said: In the Battle of Uhud, no one was
captured among the polytheists except Abu Azzah Al-Jumahi. He had
been captured in the Battle of Badr but Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, had pity for him and released him without
ransom upon the condition that he will not fight against him (i.e, the
Prophet). When he was captured once again in the Battle of Uhud, he
105

In The Defence Of the True Faith
again begged clemency. He said: “O Muhammad, have mercy on me for
the sake of my daughters and I give you a solemn promise that I shall not
fight against you.” The Prophet said: “I will not let you go for you would
turn and rub your cheek back toward Makkah and then say that you fooled
Muhammad twice.” Then he ordered that he be executed and it was carried
out. It is also said that it is on that occasion that the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “A Muslim is not stung
twice from the same hole.”
Sa‘d Ibn Abi Waqqas narrated: Allah’s Messenger once came across a
woman of Banu Deenar, whose husband, brother and father were killed
fighting alongside Allah’s Messenger at the Battle of Uhud. When they
announced the death of her relatives, she said: “What happened to Allah’s
Messenger?” They replied: “Fine, O Umm Fulan, praise be to Allah, he is
as you desire.” She said: “Show him to me so that I may see him with my
own eyes.” When he was pointed out to her and she saw that he was truly
safe, she said: “All misfortunes are nothing so long as you are safe.”
Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah said in another place: When the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saw a sword on me daubed
with blood, he said: “If you had been courageous, so also had been
‘Asim Ibn Thabit Ibn Abi Al-Aqlah, Al-Harith Ibn As-Simmah and Sahl
Ibn Hunaif.”
Ibn Hisham said: Some people of knowledge informed me that Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to ‘Ali: “The
polytheists will not inflict us with a similar loss till Allah grants us
victory.”
Ibn ‘Umar narrated that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, came across some women of Banu Al-Ashhal lamenting
over their dead in the Battle of Uhud so he said, “Hamzah has no one to
lament for him.” Thereafter, the women came and they lamented the death
of Hamzah in his presence (i.e. the Prophet) until he said: “Command
them that no one should wail over the dead after this day.”
Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah narrated that the hypocrites took to jest at the weeping
of the Muslims and attempted to estrange them from Allah’s Messenger,
106

In The Defence Of the True Faith
peace be upon him, in addition to emotionally tormenting them. The evil
schemes of the Jews sprouted and hypocrisy flared up and spread quite
swiftly all over Madinah. They said: “If he were truly a Prophet, they
would not have defeated him, he would not have suffered that fate. He is
just hankering after authority and to establish and rule over a nation-state.”
The Hypocrites also parroted the vituperations of the Jews. They said to
the believers: “If you had followed us, you would have been spared this
affliction.” Then Allah revealed the Qur’an concerning those who were
obedient, those who demonstrated hypocrisy and at the same time
consoling the believers over their losses. Allah says: And (remember)
when you (Muhammad) left your household in the morning to post the
believers at their stations for the Battle (of Uhud). And Allah is AllHearer, All-Knower. (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:121)

In Order to Terrorize Abu Sufyan and His Company,
the Prophet and His Companions Go on His Trail
Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah said, after summarizing the incident of Uhud and the
Messenger of Allah’s return journey to Madinah: A man from the people
of Makkah came to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, and he inquired from him about the movement of Abu Sufyan
and his men and the man said: “They have disembarked at an open-air and
I overheard them trading blames, one group saying to the other: ‘You have
not achieved anything. You had them in your grasp, then you let them go
without slaughtering them. Now they still have men gathering to fight
against you.’ On hearing this, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, ordered his Companions, inspite of their
excruciating injuries, to follow their trail. He said: “No one should follow
me except those who partook in the war.” ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said: “I
will march along with you.” “No,” the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, vehemently objected. Inspite of their
tribulation, the injured Companions responded to Allah and His
Messenger and set out with him. Allah says in His Noble Book: Those
who answered (the Call of) Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad) after
being wounded; for those of them who did good deeds and feared Allah,
there is a great reward. (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:172)

107

In The Defence Of the True Faith
He (the narrator) added: Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him,) permitted Jabir to join him when it was mentioned to him
that he remained behind in Madinah because his father commanded him
to stay back and care for his sisters.
Ibn ‘Abbas said concerning the Verse: Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us
(Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:173) Ibrahim said it when he was thrown into the
fire and Muhammad also said it when it was said to him: Verily, the people
(pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), therefore, fear them.
But it (only) increased them in Faith, and they said: “Allah (Alone) is
Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us).” (Soorah
Aal ‘Imran 3:173) Al-Bukhari related it exclusively.
Al-Bukhari related from ‘A’ishah concerning the Verse: Those who
answered (the Call of) Allah and the Messenger (Muhammad) after being
wounded; for those of them who did good deeds and feared Allah, there
is a great reward. (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:172) She said to ‘Urwah: “O my
nephew! Your father, AzZubair and Abu Bakr were amongst them (i.e.
those who responded to the call of Allah and the Messenger on the day
(of the Battle of Uhud). When Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, suffered what he suffered on the day of Uhud and the
pagans left, the Prophet was afraid that they might return. So he said,
‘Who will go on their (i.e. pagans’) trail?’ He then selected seventy men
from amongst them (for this purpose) among whom were Abu Bakr and
Az-Zubair.” This is how AlBukhari related it.
This wording is extremely strange for the popular version among the
authors of books on Islamic military history is that those who went with
Allah’s Messenger, peace be upon him, to Hamra’Al-Asad were the same
people who partook in the Battle of Uhud; they were seven hundred in
total as mentioned earlier and seventy of them were martyred.
Ibn Jareer related through ‘Awfi Ibn ‘Abbas who said: Allah put fear into
the heart of Abu Sufyan on the Day of Uhud after what occurred from
him, so he returned to Makkah. The Battle of Uhud occurred in Shawwal.
The merchants used to set out in Dhul-Qa‘dah for Madinah and they
would disembark at AlBadr As-Sughra once every year. So they set out
after the Battle of Uhud. Many of the Muslims were wounded and they
108

In The Defence Of the True Faith
complained to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, about that. The pain of their situation became aggravated. So the
Messenger chose the people who would accompany him on the trail from
the willing ones. He said to us: “Right now, they are coming for Hajj and
they will not be capable of something similar till next year.” Then Shaitan
came in order to terrify his friends; he said: ‘Hosts have gathered against
you.’ So the people objected to following the Prophet so he said: “I am
going even if no one follows me.” So Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthman, ‘Ali,
Talhah, Az-Zubair, Sa‘d, ‘Abdur-Rahman Ibn ‘Awf, Abu ‘Ubaidah, Ibn
Mas‘ood and Hudhaifah among seventy others stood with him. Thus, they
went on the trail of Abu Sufyan till they reached As-Safra.’ Then Allah
revealed: Those who answered (the Call of) Allah and the Messenger
(Muhammad) after being wounded; for those of them who did good deeds
and feared Allah, there is a great reward. (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:172) This
narration is also strange.
Ibn Ishaq related: When Allah’s Messenger returned to Madinah,
‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy, according to what Az-Zuhri narrated to me, used to
stand unobjectionably to address the people every Friday. It used to be a
distinction to his personality and his clan who saw it as a honor that one
of them, whenever the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, got up on Friday to address the people, would corroborate:
“This is the Messenger of Allah in your presence. Allah has ennobled and
honored you with his presence (in your misdt) so help and strengthen him,
listen and obey him and then he would sit. After his misdemeanor at the
Battle of Uhud and upon the people’s return to Madinah, ‘Abdullah Ibn
Ubayy again wanted to act as he used to whenever the Prophet rose to
address the people. Infuriated by his turncoat attitude, the Muslims seized
him by his cloth and told him: “Sit down! O enemy of Allah, you are not
fit for that endeavor, not after what you have done.” He angrily went out
overstepping the necks of people while fuming: ‘By Allah, it is as if I have
said something wrong whereas I merely stood to consolidate his affair.’
Some Ansari met him at the entrance of the Mosque and they asked: “Woe
to you, what happened to you?” He said: “I stood to consolidate his affair
and a group of his Companions pounced on me, pulled me and tonguelashed me as if I said something bad when I stood to consolidate his
affair.” The Ansaris said: “Return so that Allah’s Messenger may seek
Allah’s forgiveness for you.” Arrogantly, ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said: “By
109

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Allah, I do not have any desire for him to seek forgiveness on my behalf.”
Then Ibn Ishaq cited some of the Verses of the Qur’an that were revealed
concerning the story of Uhud in Soorah Aal ‘Imran from the Verse: And
(remember) when you (Muhammad) left your household in the morning
to post the Believers at their stations for the Battle (of Uhud). And Allah
is AllHearer, All-Knower. (Soorah Aal ‘Imran 3:121) till a complete sixty
Verses were revealed and he discussed them.
We (the author) have also extensively and sufficiently discussed that in
our book, At-Tafseer.
I say: None of the polytheists were captured except for Abu Azzah AlJumahi, according to what was related by Ash-Shafi’i and others. Allah’s
Messenger ordered his execution and it was carried out by AzZubair in
his presence. It is also said that it was ‘Asim Ibn Thabit Ibn Abul-Aflah
who executed him.

The Fourth Year of Hijrah
A military operation led by Abu Salamah Ibn Abdul Asad Abi Tulaihah
Al-Asadi took place in Muharram of the fourth year. The contingent
advanced as far as the watering place known as Qatan.
Al-Waqidi related from Salamah Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Abi
Salamah and others that Abu Salamah took part in the Battle of Uhud and
his upper arm was injured, which he kept nursing for a month. At the
outset of the month of Muharram, exactly thirty-five months after the
Hijrah, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
called upon him and said: “Set out with this contingent; I have appointed
you to command it.” He gave him the war standard and said: “Advance
till you reach the territory of the Banu Asad and raid them.” He
recommended him to have the awe of Allah and to be good to the Muslims
accompanying him. One hundred and fifty warriors marched forth with
him till they reached the lower part of Qatan which is Banu Asad’s
watering place. Meanwhile, Taleehah Al-Asadi and his brother, Salamah,
the sons of Khuwailid, had mobilized there, a military contingent from the
various allies of Banu Asad with the intent of attacking the Prophet. A
man had come from them to inform the Prophet of their collaboration
110

In The Defence Of the True Faith
against him. Thus Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, sent with him Abu Salamah at the helm of this military
contingent.
When they got to their territory, the Muslims took them by surprise and
they dispersed in confusion and abandoned large herds of camels and
goats. Abu Salamah gathered them as booty and also captured three of
their men and returned to Madinah.
‘Umar Ibn Abu Salamah said, Abu Usamah Al-Jushami was the one who
injured my father and he kept nursing the wound for a whole month and
he was healed. When he got well, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, sent him to Qatan in Muharram of the fourth year
of Hijrah. He was away (on the military expedition) for about ten nights.
However, on his return to Madinah, his wound relapsed and he died three
days to the end of the month of Jumadal-Oola.
My mother observed the iddah till the conclusion of four months and ten
days and then Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, married her and consummated the marriage in the last few nights of
the month of Shawwal. My mother used to say: “There is no harm in
marrying and consummating the marriage in the month of Shawwal. The
Prophet married me in Shawwal and consummated with me in the same
month.” He added: Umm Salamah died in Dhul-Qa‘dah in the 59th year.
This is related by Al-Baihaqi.
I say: we shall mention again the Prophet’s marriage to Umm Salamah in
Shawwal in the close of the discussion of the events of this year.

The Ghazwat of Ar-Rajee‘
“Allah’s Messenger sent a contingent of ten men as spies under the
leadership of ‘Asim Ibn Thabit They proceeded till they reached Hadah,
a place between ‘Usfan and Makkah, and their news reached a branch of
the tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. About one hundred men, who
were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place
where they had eaten dates at their stopover. They said, “These are the
dates of Yathrib (i.e. Madinah),” and they continued to follow their tracks.
111

In The Defence Of the True Faith
When ‘Asim and his companions saw their pursuers, they went up on a
high place and the people encircled them. They said to them, “Come down
and surrender, and we promise and guarantee that we will not kill any one
of you.”
‘Asim Ibn Thabit, the leader of the contingent, said, “By Allah! I will not
come down to be under the protection of infidels. O Allah! Convey our
news to Your Prophet.” Then they shot arrows at them till they killed
‘Asim along with six others, and a group came down accepting their
promise and covenant, and they were Khubaib Zaid Ibn Ad-Dathinah and
another man. When they captured them, they untied the strings of their
bows and bind them with it.
Then the third (of the captives) said, “This is the first betrayal. By Allah!
I will not go with you. No doubt these have set a good example for me.
Namely the martyred.”
So, they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as
he refused, they killed him. They took Khubaib and Zaid Ibn Dathinah
with them and sold them (as slaves) in Makkah.
The sons of Al-Harith Ibn ‘Amir Ibn Nawfal bought Khubaib for he was
the person who had killed (their father) Al-Harith Ibn ‘Amr on the day (of
the Battle) of Badr. Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till they
decided unanimously to kill him. One day Khubaib asked to borrow, from
a daughter of Al-Harith, a razor to shave his pubic hair, and she lent it to
him.
Inadvertently, while she was inattentive, her going son went to him (i.e.
Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the
razor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her
fear and said, “Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such
a thing.”
Later on (while narrating the story) she said, “By Allah, I had never seen
a better captive than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating from a
bunch of grapes in his hand while he was fettered with iron chains and (at
that time) there were no fruit in Makkah.” She used to say, “It was food
112

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Allah provided Khubaib with.” When they took him from the sacred
precinct of Makkah to Al-Hill (outside the sanctuary) to kill him, Khubaib
requested them. “Allow me to offer two Rak‘ahs of prayers.” They
allowed him and he prayed two Rak‘ahs and then said, “By Allah! Had I
not been afraid that you would think that I was worried, I would have
prayed more.” Then he (invoked evil upon them) saying, “O Allah! Count
them and kill them one by one, and do not leave anyone of them.” Then
he recited: As I am killed as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive
my death for Allah’s Sake, for this is for the Cause of Allah. If He wishes,
He will bless the cut limbs of my body
Then ‘Uqbah Ibn Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib
who set the tradition of a Muslim praying while in to captivity (before he
is executed).
Later on, when some polytheists from Quraish were informed that ‘Asim
had been killed, they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his
head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because) ‘Asim had
killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the Battle) of Badr. So, a swarm
of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over ‘Asim and
protect him from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything
from his flesh.”

Military Contingent of Umayyah Ad-Damri in
Pursuit of the Murderers of Khubaib
Abu Sufyan addressed a group of Quraish saying: Is there a man who
could assassinate Muhammad while he walks in the markets, so that we
may obtain our full retribution. A Bedouin Arab came to him at his
residence and said: “If you would give me my due in full, I will proceed
to assassinate him, for I am wellaware of the path and with me is my
dagger which is like an eagle’s wings.” Abu Sufyan then said: “You are
our cohort.”

113

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Then he provided him with a camel and provision and said: “Proceed
immediately to accomplish your goal for I fear that someone might learn
of this plot and pass the information on to Muhammad.” The Bedouin
said: “No one will hear of it.” So, he set out the same night on his camel
for his dastard mission. He traveled for five days and reached Al-Harrah
in the morning of the sixth day. There, he began to inquire about the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, till he got
to the place of prayer and he was informed that he (the Messenger of
Allah) had gone toward Banu ‘Abdul-Ashhal. Again, the Bedouin
redirected his camel till he got to the quarters of Banu ‘Abdul-Ashhal. He
tethered his camel and went ahead to seek out the Messenger of Allah.
Meanwhile, the Prophet was in his Mosque meeting with a group of his
Companions. When the Bedouin entered the Mosque and the Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saw him, he said:
“This man has come intending some treachery but Allah has frustrated his
effort.” The man stopped and asked: “Which one of you is Ibn ‘AbdulMuttalib?” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, answered: “I am Ibn ‘Abdul-Muttalib.” Then he came close and
overshadowed the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, as if with an
intent to please him and demonstrate his joy. Usaid Ibn Hudair pulled him
aside and said: “Step aside from Allah’s Messenger,” and he seized his
underpants and the dagger was revealed. “This is a treacherous fellow!”
and the Bedouin became alarmed and began shouting for clemency: “My
blood! My blood!! O Muhammad.”
Usaid Ibn Hudair kept shaking him violently with his cloth wrapped
around his neck. The Prophet said to him: “Tell me the truth. Who are you
and what has brought you? If you tell me the truth, it will benefit you but
if you lie to me, be sure that I have been informed of it.” The Bedouin
said: “Will I then be safe?” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, said: “Yes you will be safe.” Then he informed him
of his plot in conjunction with Abu Sufyan and what he has given him in
reward. The Prophet ordered that he be detained in the custody of Usaid
Ibn Hudair. The next day, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, called for him and said: “I have guaranteed your
security, so you may now go wherever you wish or if you desire I will
present to you a better option.” “And what option is that?” the Bedouin
asked. “That you bear witness that none deserves to be worshipped except
114

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah.” The Bedouin said: “I bear
witness that none deserves to be worshipped except Allah and that you are
the Messenger of Allah. O Muhammad, I was most terrified the moment
I saw you, my senses went away and I was weakened. Coupled with the
fact that you were aware of my purpose while no man could have preceded
me to this place with that information and besides, no one was privy to
that information; then I realized that you are forbidden (to be harmed) and
that you are upon the truth and that the party of Abu Sufyan is a party of
Shaitan.”
The Prophet kept smiling at the words of the Bedouin. He remained in
Madinah for a few days and then sought permission from the Prophet and
went away and no words were heard about him again.
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, then said
to ‘Amr Ibn Umayyah Ad-Damri and Salamah Ibn Aslam Ibn Hareesh:
“Both of you, proceed to Abu Sufyan Ibn Harb. If you find the right
opportunity, kill him.”
‘Amr continued: “So I went along with my companion till we reached the
center of Yajaj where we tethered our camels. My companion said: ‘O
‘Amr, do you have any desire that we go to Makkah so that we may
circumambulate the House (Ka‘bah) and offer two units of prayer.” I said:
“I know better than you about the character of the people of Makkah, once
they are oppressed they bear all their fangs and tenaciously hang on (to
the offense). Moreover, I am well-known in Makkah like a speckled
horse.” My companion insisted, so we proceeded and entered Makkah.
We circumambulated seven times and offered two units of prayer. When
I came out, Mua‘wiyyah Ibn Abi Sufyan met me and he quickly
recognized me. He said: “‘Amr Ibn Umayyah and his evil.” Then he
warned the people of Makkah (of our presence). They said: “‘Amr has not
come with any good intent.” ‘Amr used to be an assassin in the Jahiliyyah.
When the inhabitants of Makkah gathered, ‘Amr and Salamah fled. The
people went in their pursuit. They rushed to the mountain. ‘Amr narrated:
“Then I entered a cave and I hid from them till next morning. They
searched all over the mountain for us all through the night. But Allah
blinded them to look in the direction of Madinah. At the first illumination
of the early morning, ‘Uthman Ibn Malik Ibn ‘Ubaidullah At-Taimi
115

In The Defence Of the True Faith
approached to gather fodder for his horse. I said to Salamah Ibn Aslam, if
he sees us he will disclose our location to the inhabitants of Makkah. Now
that they have dispersed from us, he will bring back the inhabitants of
Makkah on our trail. He kept coming directly to the entrance of the cave
till he saw us.” ‘Amr added: “I sprang out of the cave and stabbed him
below his navel with my dagger so violently that he fell down and yelled.
The inhabitants of Makkah gathered again after they had dispersed. I
recoiled into my position and I warned my companion not to move. They
came to him and asked: “Who attacked you?” He answered as he ebbed
away: “‘Amr Ibn Umayyah Ad-Damri.” Abu Sufyan said: “We knew that
he has not come for any good.” However, he was not able to reveal our
location to them as he was in the throes of his death. After he became cold,
they again frantically searched for us without success. Afterward, they
carried his dead body away. We remained in our position for two more
days until the search for us calmed down. Then we came out and
proceeded to At-Tan‘eem and my companion said to me: ‘O ‘Amr Ibn
Umayyah, do you have any desire for lowering Khubaib Ibn ‘Adiyy?” I
asked him: “Where is he?” He answered: “He is over there crucified and
surrounded by guards.” So I said: “Give me some time, move away from
here. If you fear for anything, run to your camel, hop on it and return to
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. When you
get to him, inform him of the course of events. Leave me alone for I know
the way to Madinah.” I sneaked up to Khubaib’s corpse and lifted him on
my back. I have not walked more than twenty cubits before the guards
woke up and they came in my pursuit. I threw the bier down and I did not
forget its sound. Then I stirred sand with my leg over it to cover it up.
Then I took the road to As-Safra’. My pursuers soon became exhausted
and they returned.
Meanwhile, my companion had run to his camel and rode as fast as
possible back to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him. He informed him of the incident. I proceeded on my way back till I
was overlooking Al-Ghameem. I hid inside a cave with my bow and
arrows and my sword. While I was in the cave, a tall one-eyed man from
Banu Ad-Dee from Banu Bakr approached driving his sheep and goats.
He entered the cave and found me. “Who are you?” I said: “A man from
Banu Bakr.” The man said: “I am also from Banu Bakr.” Then he reclined
and raised his voice singing:
116

In The Defence Of the True Faith
I shall never be a Muslim as long as I live
I shall never adopt the religion of the Muslims
I said to myself: By Allah, I desire to kill you. When the man slept off, I
moved close to him and killed him violently. When I proceeded on my
return journey, I met two men whom the Quraish had sent to reconnoiter
for them. I accosted them: “Surrender!” I said to them. One of them
refused and I shot him an arrow and killed him. When the other saw this,
he willingly surrendered himself to me. I restrained and tied him up and I
brought him along to the Prophet. When I arrived at Madinah, I came upon
some children of the Ansar who were playing. They heard their elderls
saying: “Here is ‘Amr!” The children then ran to the Prophet and informed
him of my arrival. I came to him leading my captive whose thumb I have
tied with my bowstring. When Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, saw me, he broke into laughter and he supplicated for
good for me. Salamah had arrived in Madinah three days before ‘Amr.

The Expedition Bi’r Ma‘oonah
Anas Ibn Malik narrated: “The Messenger of Allah sent seventy men,
called Al-Qurra‘ for some purpose. The two groups of Banu Sulaim called
Ri’l and Dhakwan appeared to them near a well called Bi’r Ma‘oonah.
The people (i.e. Al-Qurra‘) said, ‘By Allah, we have not come to harm
you, but we are passing by you on our way to do something for the
Prophet.’ But (the polytheists) killed them. The Prophet therefore invoked
evil upon them for a month during the morning prayer. That was the
beginning of AlQunoot and we used not to say Qunoot prior to that.”
Anas also narrated (that) (the tribes of) Ri'l, Dhakwan, Usayyah and Banu
Lihyan asked Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, to provide them with some men to support them against their enemy.
He therefore provided them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we
used to call Al-Qurra’ in their lifetime. They used to collect wood by
daytime and pray at night. When they were at the well of Ma‘oonah, the
polytheists betrayed and killed them. When this news reached the Prophet,
he recited Al-Qunoot for one month in the morning prayer, invoking evil
upon some of the Arab tribes, upon Ri’l, Dhakwan, ‘Usayyah and Banu
117

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Lihyan. We used to read a Verse of the Qur’an revealed concerning them
but was later abrogated. The Verse was: “Convey to our people on our
behalf the information that we have met our Lord, and He is pleased with
us, and has made us pleased.”
Al-Bukhari also related from Anas Ibn Malik that Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, sent Haram, the brother of
Umm Sulaim, at the head of seventy riders. The chief of the polytheists,
Amir Ibn At-Tufail had proposed three suggestions (to the Prophet )
saying, “Choose one of three alternatives: (1) that the Bedouins will be
under your command and the townspeople will be under my command;
(2) or that I will be your successor, (3) or, otherwise I will attack you with
two thousand warriors from Banu Ghatafan.” But before he could execute
his threat, Amir was infected with plague in the house of a lady from the
family of Umm Fulan. He said, “Shall I stay in the house of a lady from
the family of Umm Fulan after having a (swelled) gland like that of a shecamel? Get me my horse.” So he died on the back of his horse.
Then Haram, the brother of Umm Sulaim, and a lame man along with
another man from Banu Fulan went toward the polytheists (i.e. the tribe
of Amir). Haram said (to his companions), “Stay near to me, for I will go
to them. If they (i.e. polytheists) should give me protection, you will be
near to me, and if they should kill me, then you should go back to your
companions. Then Haram went to them and said, “Will you give me
protection so as to convey the message of Allah’s Messenger?” So, he
started talking to them, but they signaled to a man (to kill him) and he
went behind him and stabbed him (with a spear). He (i.e. Haram) said,
“Allahu Akbar! (Allah is Greatest), I have succeeded, by the Lord of the
Ka‘bah!” The companion of Haram was pursued by the polytheists, and
then they (i.e. Haram’s companions) were all killed except the lame man
who was at the top of a mountain. Then Allah revealed to us a Verse that
was among the ones that were later abrogated. It was: "We have met our
Lord and He is pleased with us and has made us pleased." (After this
event) the Prophet invoked evil on the polytheists every morning for thirty
days. He invoked evil upon the (tribes of) Ri’l, Dhakwan, Banu Lihyan
and Usayyah who offended Allah and His Messenger.”

118

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Bukhari also related that Anas Ibn Malik said (that): “When Haram Ibn
Milhan, his uncle, was stabbed on the day of Bi’r Ma‘oonah, he sprinkled
his blood over his face and his head this way and then said, 'I have
succeeded, by the Lord of the Ka‘bah'.”
Al-Bukhari also related that Hisham Ibn ‘Urwah narrated (that): When
those (Muslims) at Bi’r Ma‘oonah were martyred and ‘Amr Ibn Umayyah
Ad-Damri was taken prisoner, Amir Ibn At-Tufail, pointing at a killed
person, asked ‘Amr, “Who is this?” ‘Amr Ibn Umayyah said to him, “He
is ‘Amir Ibn Fuhairah.” Amir Ibn At-Tufail said, “I saw him lifted to the
sky after he was killed till I saw the sky between him and the Earth, and
then he was brought down upon the Earth. Then the news of the killed
Muslims reached the Prophet and he announced the news of their death
saying, “Your Companions (of Bi’r Ma‘oona) have been killed, and they
have asked their Lord saying, ‘O our Lord! Inform our brothers about us
as we are pleased with You and You are pleased with us’.” So Allah
informed them (i.e. the Prophet and his Companions) about them (i.e.
martyrs of Bir Ma‘oonah).
On that day, ‘Urwah Ibn Asma’ Ibn As-Salt, who was one of them, was
killed, and ‘Urwah (Ibn AzZubair) was named after ‘Urwah Ibn Asma’
and Mundhir (Ibn Az-Zubair) was named after Mundhir Ibn ‘Amr (who
had also been martyred on that day).

The Expedition of Banu Nadeer Concerning Whom
Allah Revealed Soorah Al-Hashr
It is recorded in Saheeh Al-Bukhari that Ibn ‘Abbas used to call it “Soorah
Bani An-Nadeer”. Al-Bukhari also related from Az-Zuhri from ‘Urwah
that he said: the incident of Banu Nadeer occurred three months after Badr
and before Uhud.
Ibn Ishaq related that the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, went out to Banu Nadeer seeking their assistance in paying
the blood money for the two men of Banu Amir who were accidentally
killed by ‘Amr Ibn Umayyah. This was in accordance with the clauses of
the treaty that both parties had already signed. When the Messenger of
Allah got to them, they demonstrated willingness to assist. They said: “O
119

In The Defence Of the True Faith
yes, O Abul-Qasim, we shall aid you upon what you desire.” Then the
Jews went into a private consultation. They made a proposal: “You will
never again find the man in such a position (meanwhile, the Messenger
was sitting by a wall of their homes). So, who will climb the top of this
house and thrown a large rock on him and rid us of him forever?” ‘Amr
Ibn Jahhash Ibn Ka‘b volunteered: “I am up to the task.” So he climbed
the house intent upon throwing the stone on him. Meanwhile, Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was sitting in the
midst of a group of Companions including Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Ali.
Then the secret plot was exposed to Allah’s Messenger, peace be upon
him, through Inspiration from the heavens. He immediately got up and
headed back to Madinah. Meanwhile, his Companions had noticed his
absence and had gone in search of him. They met a man who was returning
from Madinah and asked him if he had seen the Prophet and he said: “I
saw him entering Madinah.” So the Companions proceeded till they got
to him. He informed them of the evil scheme of the Jews against him.
Ibn Ishaq related: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, advanced and laid siege on them for six nights. In the course
of that, the prohibition of intoxicants was revealed. The Jews were holed
up in their fortresses. Then Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, ordered that their palm trees be cut down and burned.
When they saw this, they called out: “O Muhammad you used to forbid
evil and you used to find fault with one who perpetrates it, so why are you
cutting down and burning the palm trees?” He said that a group of the
Banu ‘Awf Ibn Al-Khazraj among whom was ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy,
Wadee‘ah and Malik Ibn Qawqal, Suwaid and Da‘is had sent words to
Banu Nadeer bolstering them: “Remain in your residences and defend
yourself. Verily we shall not abandon you. If they fight against you, we
shall fight alongside you and if you are expelled, we shall go along with
you.” Banu Nadeer chose to remain in contravention of the Prophet’s
order of their expulsion relying on the promise of reinforcement to fight
their cause. However, Allah caste terror into their hearts and they
eventually preferred expulsion, pleading for their blood to be spared. The
Prophet stipulated that the can only take with them from their belongings
that which can be carried on the back of a camel, and they were not to
120

In The Defence Of the True Faith
carry an weapons. They agreed to all of these terms and were expelled
from Madinah.
Ibn Ishaq also said: They carried with them only their belongings that
could be carried on the back of a camel. Some would even remove their
doorframe and load it on the back of their camel and then proceed. Some
of them went to Khaibar and others went to Sham. Among the notables of
those who went to Khaibar were Sallam Ibn Abul-Huqaiq, Kinanah Ibn
Ar-Rabee‘ Ibn Abil-Huqaiq and Huyayy Ibn Akhtab.
Ibn Ishaq added: Allah revealed Soorah Al-Hashr in its entirety
concerning them, detailing His wrath which the inflicted upon them and
the punishment executed on them by His Messenger and what they
themselves wrought by their own hands. Then Ibn Ishaq began to explain
the Verses and we have also discussed it extensively in our book of
Tafseer. All praise is due to Allah.
Allah says: Whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is on the Earth
glorifies Allah. And He is the Almighty, the All-Wise. He it is Who drove
out the disbelievers among the people of the Scripture (i.e. the Jews of the
tribe of Bani An-Nadeer) from their homes at the first gathering. You did
not think that they would get out. And they thought that their fortresses
would defend them from Allah! But Allah’s (Torment) reached them from
a place whereof they expected it not, and He cast terror into their hearts,
so that they destroyed their own dwellings with their own hands and the
hands of the believers. Then take admonition, O you with eyes (to see).
And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would
certainly have punished them in this world, and in the Hereafter theirs
shall be the torment of the Fire. That is because they opposed Allah and
His Messenger (Muhammad). And whosoever opposes Allah, then verily,
Allah is Severe in punishment. What you (O Muslims) cut down of the
palm-trees (of the enemy), or you left them standing on their stems, it was
by Leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the Fasiqoon
(rebellious, disobedient to Allah). (Soorah Al-Hashr 59:1-5)
Here, Allah glorifies Himself and informed us that all His celestial and
terrestrial creatures glorify Him, and that He is Almighty, Whose
Greatness and Eminence do not dissipate, and the Wise in all of what He
121

In The Defence Of the True Faith
created and in all what He decreed and legislated. Included in this is the
decree and direction of the Messenger of Allah and His believing servants
in granting them victory over their enemies, the Jews, who opposed Allah
and His Messenger and estranged themselves from Allah’s Messenger and
His Shari‘ah. Nevertheless, all of these did not impel fighting against them
till their siege by the one who has been aided with the casting of terror in
the enemies’ hearts from the distance of a month’s journey. Still he
besieged them with his forces and his own eminent self for six nights.
They were seized by extreme fear till they were humbled and pleaded for
a truce to preserve their blood which was granted to them upon the terms
that they will take from their wealth only what can be carried on the back
of their riding animals and that they will not carry with them any weapon
as a way of humiliation and precaution. They destroyed their own
dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers. Then take
admonition, O you with eyes (to see). (Soorah Al-Hashr 59:2)
Then Allah mentions that if they had not been exiled (i.e. from the
neighborhood of Allah’s Messenger in Madinah), they would have been
inflicted with a far more severe punishment in this world, i.e., execution,
in addition to a painful punishment which would have been in store for
them in the Hereafter.
Then Allah mentions the wisdom contained in burning some of their palmtrees and sparing others all of which was acceptable. What you (O
Muslims) cut down of the palm-trees (of the enemy)…” i.e. of good dates.
“…or you left them standing on their stems, it was by Leave of Allah...
(Soorah Al-Hashr 59:5)
All of that has been permitted by legislation and decree so there is no
blame on you concerning that. It is not corruption as claimed by the vilest
of slaves; rather it is a demonstration of power and humiliation for the
sinful and disbelieving folks.
Al-Bukhari related from Ibn ‘Umar that Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, had the date-palm trees of Banu Nadeer
burned and cut down at a place called Al-Buwairah. Allah then revealed:
What you (O Muslims) cut down of the palm-trees (of the enemy), or you
left them standing on their stems, it was by Leave of Allah, and in order
122

In The Defence Of the True Faith
that He might disgrace the Fasiqoon (the rebellious, the disobedient to
Allah).(Soorah Al-Hashr 59:5)
It is also recorded in Al-Bukhari from Ibn ‘Umar that: “The Prophet(Peace
and Blessings of Allah be upon him)burned the date-palm trees of Bani
An-Nadeer. Hassan Ibn Thabit said the following poetic verses about this
event:“The terrible burning of Al-Buwairah has been received indifferently
By the nobles of Banu Lu’ayy (the masters and nobles of Quraish).”
Abu Sufyan Ibn Al-Harith (i.e. the Prophet’s cousin who was still a
disbeliever then) replied to Hassan, saying in poetic verses:“May Allah bless that burning and set all its (i.e. Madinah) parts on
burning fire. You will see who is far from it (i.e. Al- Buwairah)
And which of our lands will be harmed by it (i.e. the burning of AlBuwairah).”
Then, Allah mentions the ruling of Fay’ (booty) which stipulates that the
wealth of the Banu Nadeer was exclusively the right of the Messenger to
dispose off as Allah deems fit, as recorded in the Saheehain from ‘Umar
Ibn Al-Khattab, who said: “The properties abandoned by Banu Nadeer
were the ones which Allah bestowed upon His Messenger for which no
expedition was undertaken either with cavalry or camelry. These
properties were particularly meant for the Messenger of Allah. He would
meet the annual expenditure of his family from the income thereof, and
would spend what remained for purchasing horses and weapons as
preparation for Jihad.”
Then, Allah elaborates on the ruling of Fay’: it is meant for the
Muhajiroon and Ansar and those who follow them in goodness copying
their pattern and threading their path. What Allah gave as booty (Fay’) to
His Messenger (Muhammad) from the people of the townships, - it is for
Allah, His Messenger (Muhammad), the kindred (of Messenger
Muhammad), the orphans, Al-Masakeen (the poor), and the wayfarer, in
order that it may not become a fortune used by the rich among you. And
123

In The Defence Of the True Faith
whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad) gives you, take it, and
whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), and fear Allah. Verily, Allah
is Severe in punishment. (Soorah Al-Hashr 59:7)
Anas Ibn Malik narrated from the Prophet of Allah, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, that a man used to present date palm-trees to the
Prophet till Banu Quraizah and Banu Nadeer were conquered (then he
returned to the people their date-palms). My people ordered me to ask the
Prophet to return some or all the date-palms they had given, but the
Prophet had given those trees to Umm Ayman. On that, Umm Ayman
came and put the garment around my neck and said, “No, by Him Who
has the only right to be worshipped, he will not return those trees to you
as he (i.e. the Prophet) has given them to me.” The Prophet said (to her),
“Return those trees and I will give you so much (instead of them).” But
she kept on refusing, saying, “No, by Allah,” till he gave her ten times the
number of her date-palms.”
Then Allah (SWT) says in castigation of the hypocrites who pandered
toward Banu Nadeer secretly, as mentioned previously, giving them the
promise of aid even though they did not carry out any of their promises.
Rather, they disappointed them when they were in dire need; meanwhile,
their minds had deceived them.
Have you (O Muhammad) not observed the hypocrites who say to their
friends among the People of the Scriptures who disbelieve: “(By Allah) If
you are expelled, we (too) indeed will go out with you, and we shall never
obey any one against you, and if you are attacked (in fight), we shall
indeed help you.” But Allah is Witness, that they verily, are liars. Surely,
if they (the Jews) are expelled, never will they (hypocrites) go out with
them, and if they are attacked, they will never help them. And if they do
help them, they (hypocrites) will turn their backs, so they will not be
victorious. (al-Hashr [59]:11,12)
Then He chastised them for their cowardice, paucity of their knowledge
and their dim-wittedness. Then He drew for them a repulsive and
repugnant similitude of Shaitan when he said to man: “Disbelieve in

124

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Allah.” But when (man) disbelieves in Allah, Shaitan says: “I am free of
you, I fear Allah, the Lord of Al‘Alamin (mankind, jinns and all that
exists)!) (Soorah Al-Hashr 59:16)

The Story of ‘Amr Ibn Su‘da Al-Qarazi When He
Came Upon the Desolate Residence of Banu Nadeer
After Banu Nadeer had been expelled from Madinah, ‘Amr Ibn Su‘da
came and went round their desolate quarters. When he be held its ruins he
was gripped by a deep thought and then he went back to Banu Quraizah.
He found them in their church. He blew their horn and they all gathered.
Az-Zubair Ibn Bata asked him: “O Abu Sa‘eed, where have you been all
day that we did not see you.” He used to adhere to the church. He said:
“Today, I saw a lesson from which we should learn. I saw the residences
of our brothers in ruin after they had witnessed glory, strength, dignity,
precedence and dexterity. They had abandoned their wealth and now it is
controlled by other than them and they were expelled in an ignominious
manner. I swear by the Tawrah, this sort of affliction did not come upon
a people whom Allah has any use for. Prior to that, Ibn Al-Ashraf, the
custodian of their dignity and Ibn Sunainah, their leader and Banu
Qainuqa‘ had met similar fate. Meanwhile, they were Jews of strength,
men of great numbers, military might and support. They were encircled
and no one escaped with his head till they were enslaved and some were
wounded and they were let off upon being expelled from Yathrib.
“My people, you have all witnessed all that you have witnessed, so listen
to me and come along so that we may follow Muhammad. By Allah, you
are aware that he is a Prophet, the tiding and affairs of whom Ibn AlHayyaban, Abu ‘Umair and Ibn Hirash have given us. Both of them were
the most knowledgeable Jews who came to us from Jerusalem to await his
coming. They enjoined on us to follow him and to convey their greeting
to him (whenever he appeared) after which they died upon their religion
and we buried them by this rock of ours.”
After hearing this speech, the entire congregation was dead silent and no
one said a word. Then he repeated his address and scared them with the
threat of war, enslavement and expulsion to drive home his point. AzZubair Ibn Bata said: “I swear by the Tawrah, I had read his attributes in
125

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Bata’s book, the Tawrah revealed to Moosa but not in the Mathani which
we have invented by ourselves.” Thereupon Ka‘b Ibn Asad said to him:
“So what has prevented you (from following him), O Aba ‘AbdurRahman?” He replied: “You, O Ka‘b.” Surprised at this claim, Ka‘b Ibn
Asad asked: “How is that? I swear by the Tawrah, I have never stood in
your way.” “You have.” Az-Zubair insisted and added: “You are our most
influential person and our trustee. If you follow him, we will also follow
him and if you refuse we will also refuse.” Then ‘Amr Ibn Su‘da turned
to Ka‘b and he mentioned their disputation on this till ‘Amr said: “I do
not have anything more to say concerning him than what I have already
said: (i.e.) my heart is not comfortable with following (him).” Related by
Al-Baihaqi.

The Ghazwat of Banu Lihyan During Which the Fear
Prayer Was First Held at Usfan
Imam Ahmad related that Ayyash said: We were with the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, at Usfan and we were
arrayed against the disbelievers led by Khalid Ibn Al-Waleed. The enemy
straddled us from the direction of the Qiblah. The Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, led us in Salat Zuhr. The Kuffar
said: “We suffered from negligence; we became careless. We should have
attacked them while they were praying. It is more beloved to them than
their children and their lives.” Thereupon, Jibraeel descended with this
Verse: “When you (O Messenger Muhammad) are among them, and lead
them in As-Salat (the prayer)…” (Soorah An-Nisa’ 4:102)
When the time of the afternoon prayer came, the Messenger of Allah
peace be upon him, stood facing the Qiblah, and the disbelievers were
standing in front of him. The people stood in a row behind him and there
was another row behind this row. The Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, bowed and all of them bowed. He then
prostrated and also the row near him prostrated. The other people in the
second row remained standing and stood guard over them. When they
performed two prostrations and stood up, those who were behind them
prostrated. The people in the front row near him then stepped backward
taking the place of the people in the second row and the second row took
the place of the first row.
126

In The Defence Of the True Faith
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, then
bowed and all of them bowed together. Then he and the row near him
prostrated themselves. The other people in the second row remained
standing and stood guard over them. When the Messenger of Allah and
the row near him (i.e. the front row) were seated, the people in the second
row behind them prostrated themselves. Then all of them were seated. The
Prophet then uttered the salutation upon all of them. He prayed in his
manner at Usfan as well as at the territory of Banu Sulaim.”
Jabir narrated: We partook in a military expedition with the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, against the people of
Juhainah. A ferocious battle ensued. When it was time for Zuhr, the
polytheists said: “If we had attacked them (during their prayer), we would
have decimated them.” Whereupon Jibraeel informed the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, of that and he inturn said
to us: “They (the Kuffar) say, the time of Salat will soon come which is
more beloved to them than their children'.”
Imam Ahmad related from Abu Hurairah that Allah’s Messenger, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, disembarked between Dajnan and
Usfan and the polytheists said: “These people have a prayer (which they
offer) that is much more beloved to them than their children and their
virgin women – and that is – the ‘Asr Prayer. Mobilize yourselves and
let’s attack them in unison.” Then Jibraeel came to Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and ordered him to divide his
Companions into two groups and that he should pray leading the first
group while the other stands behind to guard with their weapons. Then the
other group would also come to pray with him while the first group would
also stand guard with their weapons so that the two groups would pray
one Rak‘ah each with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, and the Prophet will offer two Rak‘ahs.”
I say: “If Abu Hurairah witnessed this incident, then it occurred after
Khaibar, otherwise the narration would be one of the mursals of the
Companions and there is no harm about that in the view of the majority
of scholars. And Allah (SWT) knows best.

127

In The Defence Of the True Faith
However, whether the Ghazwat of Usfan occurred before or after
Khandaq is still a controversial issue. Some scholars, among whom is
Ash-Shafi’i, claim that the "Fear Prayer" was legislated after the Battle of
Khandaq. On that day, they had delayed the prayer beyond its appointed
time due to the excuse of fighting. Had the "Fear Prayer" been legislated
at the time, they would have offered it and they would not have delayed
the prayer beyond its appointed time. This is why some of the military
historians argue that the Ghazwat of Banu Lihyan, during which the "Fear
Prayer" was offered at Usfaan, occurred after the expedition of Banu
Quraizah.

The Expedition of Dhatur-Riqa‘
Ibn Ishaq related: After the invasion of Banu Nadeer, Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, remained in Madinah for the
month of Rabee‘ ul-Akhir and some part of Jumada. Then he invaded Najd
to checkmate the two tribes of Muharib and Banu Tha‘labah of Ghatafan.
He appointed Abu Dharr to look after the affairs of Madinah and,
according to Ibn Hisham, it was ‘Uthman Ibn Affan who was appointed.
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
advanced till he reached Nakhl. The expedition was known as the
expedition of Dhatur-Riqa‘. Ibn Hisham said that it was called so because
their flag became tattered in the battle. It is also said that the name DhaturRiqa‘ belonged to a tree located at the scene.
Ibn Ishaq said: They confronted a host of Ghatafan (warriors) and they
came close to fighting but it was averted because there was mutual fear
between the two forces such that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, led the Companions in the “Fear Prayer.”
Ibn Hisham had traced the chain of the Hadith of the "Fear Prayer" from
‘Abdul-Warith Ibn Sa‘eed AtTannoori from Yoonus Ibn ‘Ubaid from AlHasan from Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah and the second chain is through ‘AbdulWarith from Ayyoob from Abu Az-Zubair from Jabir. The third chain is
through ‘AbdulWarith from Ayyoob from Nafi‘ from Ibn ‘Umar.
However, in all of these chains, neither Ghazwat of Najd nor that of
Dhatur-Riqa‘ was mentioned. Nevertheless, there is no contradiction in
the timing and place of the two.
128

In The Defence Of the True Faith
The fact of the expedition of Dhatur-Riqa‘, which took place in Najd
against Banu Muharib and Banu Tha‘labah of the Ghatafan, occurring
before the Battle of Khandaq is disputable. Al-Bukhari argues that it
occurred after Khaibar drawing the evidence for it from the fact that Abu
Moosa Al-Ash‘ari witnessed it, as shall be pointed out soon. Meanwhile,
his arrival was in the nights of Khaibar in the company of Ja‘afar and his
companions. The same is also true of Abu Hurairah and he has narrated:
“I offered the 'Fear Prayer' with the Messenger of Allah in the expedition
of Najd.” That whish also indicates that it came after the Battle of
Khandaq is that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, permitted Ibn ‘Umar to participate in fighting for the first time in the
Battle of Khandaq , it is recorded in the Saheeh that he said: “I partook in
the military expedition with the Messenger in the direction of Najd,” and
he mentioned the "Fear Prayer."

The Story of Gawrath Ibn Al-Harith
Jabir related that a man from Banu Muharib called Gawrath said to his
people from the Ghatafan and Muharib: “Shouldn’t I kill Muhammad for
you?” They responded: “Yes. And how are you going to accomplish
that?” He said: “I shall assassinate him.” Then he approached the Prophet
while he was sitting and the Messenger of Allah’s sword was in his lap.
So he said: “Muhammad, may I look at this sword of yours?” and the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, replied:
“Yes.” He took the sword, unsheathed it and began to brandish it and
Allah restrained him. He said: “Muhammad, aren’t you afraid of me?”
“No, I do not entertain any fear of you,” the Prophet said. The man
insisted: “You are not afraid of me while there is a sword in my hand?”
Again the Prophet responded calmly: “No, Allah will protect me from
your harm.” Then he sheathed the sword and returned it to him and Allah
revealed: O you who believe! Remember the Favor of Allah unto you
when some people desired (made a plan) to stretch out their hands against
you, but (Allah) withheld their hands from you. So fear Allah. And in
Allah let Believers put their trust. (Soorah Al-Ma’idah 5:11)
Jabir narrated that he took part in the expedition of Najd along with
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and when
the time for the afternoon rest approached he was in a valley with plenty
129

In The Defence Of the True Faith
of thorny trees; he dismounted under a tree and rested in its shade and
hung his sword (on it). The people dispersed amongst the trees seeking
shade. While we were in this state, Allah’s Messenger called us and we
came and found a Bedouin sitting in front of him. The Prophet said, “This
(Bedouin) came to me while I was asleep, and he took my sword stealthily.
I woke up while he was standing by my head, holding my sword without
its sheath. He said, ‘Who will save you from me?’ I replied, ‘Allah.’ So
he sheathed it (i.e. the sword) and sat down, and here he is.” But Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, did not punish him
inspite of what he had done.

The Story of the One Whose Wife Was Killed in the
Expedition
Jabir Ibn Abdullah narrated: We proceeded in the company of the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, for the
Battle of Dhatur-Riqa‘. One of the Muslims killed the wife of one of the
disbelievers. He (the husband of the woman killed) took an oath saying: I
shall not rest until I draw blood from one of the Companions of
Muhammad.
He went out following the footsteps of the Prophet. The Prophet encamped
at a certain place. He said: “Who will keep watch on us?” A person from
the Muhajiroon (Emigrants) and another from the Ansar (Helpers)
volunteered. He said: “Go to the mouth of the mountain pass.” volunteers
were ‘Ammar Ibn Yasir and ‘Abbad Ibn Bishr. When they went to the
mouth of the mountain pass the man from the Ansar asked the man from
the Muhajiroon: “Which section of the night do you wish that I stand
guard while you lie down, the first part or the last?” The Muhajiroon said:
“Stand guard in the first part.” So, the Muhajiroon lay down to sleep while
the man from the Ansar stood praying.
The man (enemy) came to them. When he saw the person he realized that
he was the watchman of the Muslims. He shot him with an arrow and hit
the target. But the Ansari took the arrow out and threw it away and
remained standing (in prayer). He (the enemy) then shot a second arrow
and then a third one, hitting the target on each occasion. Each time, the
Ansari would remove the arrow and throw it away while still standing in
130

In The Defence Of the True Faith
prayer. Then he (the Ansari) bowed and prostrated and awoke his
companion. When he (the enemy) perceived that they (the Muslims) had
become aware of his presence, he ran away.
When the man from the Muhajiroon saw the man from the Ansar bleeding,
he exclaimed: “Subhan-Allah (Glory be to Allah)! Why did you not wake
me up the first time when he shot at you?” He replied: I was busy reciting
a chapter of the Qur’an and I did not like to break it till I complete it.
When he shot at me repeatedly I bowed and stirred you. I swear by Allah,
had I not feared that I would be neglectful of the duty post which Allah’s
Messenger commanded me to man, my life would have been terminated
before I break its recitation or I succeed in completing it.” This is how Ibn
Ishaq has related it in Al-Maghazi and Abu Dawood had related it from
Abu Tawbah from Ibn Al-Mubarak from Ibn Ishaq.

The Story of Jabir’s Camel During This Expedition
Jabir Ibn Abdullah narrated: I went out with Allah’s Messenger to the
expedition of Dhatur-Riqa‘ of Nakhl riding my slow and exhausted camel.
On our return journey, the army preceded while I lagged behind. The
Prophet came up to me and said, “O Jabir.” I replied, “Yes?” He said,
“What is the matter with you?” I replied, “My camel is slow and tired, so
I am left behind.” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, said: “Make it kneel.” I did so and the Prophet also did so
(with his own camel). Then he said: “Give me the stick in your hand (or
break a branch from a tree for me).” I did as he ordered. So, he got down
and poked the camel with this stick several times and then ordered me to
ride. I rode the camel and it became so fast.
While I was discussing with Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, he asked me: “Will you sell your camel to me, O
Jabir?” I said: “I will rather give it to you as gift.” “No, I will pay its
worth.” The Prophet insisted. “Then make an offer,” I said. The
Messenger of Allah said: “I have taken it for a dirham.” I said: “No.” The
Prophet bargained further: “Then for two dirhams,” “No,” I insisted. The
Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, kept jerking up the price till he
offered one uqiyyah (of gold).” “Have you been pleased, O Messenger of
Allah?” He said: “Yes.” “Then it is yours,” I said. The Prophet then said:
“I have taken it.”
131

In The Defence Of the True Faith
In the course of our discussion, he asked me: “Have you got married?” I
replied in the affirmative. He asked, “A virgin or a matron?” I replied, “I
married a matron.” The Prophet said, “Why have you not married a virgin,
so that you may play with her and she may play with you?” Jabir
responded, “O Messenger of Allah, my father had been martyred in the
Battle of Uhud and left for me seven sisters (young in age) so I liked to
marry a matron who could collect them all and comb their hair and look
after them.” The Prophet said, “You will attain by Allah’s leave. When
we reached Sirar, we will order camels to be slaughtered, spend the day
there so that when she (Jabir’s wife) hear of our return and she will dust
her cushion.” I said: “We do not have a cushion.” He replied: “You will
have. When you arrive, I advise you associate with your wife (that you
may have an intelligent son).” When we arrived at Sirar, the Messenger
did as he said. He ordered that camels be slaughtered and we stayed for
the day there.
At night fall, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, entered Madinah and we entered with him. I related to the
woman about the events including all that Allah’s Messenger said to me.
She said: “Please listen and obey (the Prophet).” In the morning, I took
hold of the camel and headed to him till I tethered it by the entrance of the
Messenger of Allah’s house, then I sat in the mosque nearby. When the
Messenger came out and saw the camel he said: “What is this?” They said:
“Jabir brought this camel.” “So where is Jabir?” the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked. I was called by him and
when I came, he said, “O son of my brother, take hold of your camel for
it is yours.” Then he called Bilal and said to him: “Go with Jabir and weigh
for him one uqiyyah (of gold).” So I went with him and Bilal weighed for
me one uqiyyah and added a little more for me. He added: “It never ceased
to increase (in its blessing) in my possession till it was taken on the Day
of Harrah. Something similar has been related in the Saheeh from Jabir.

The Second Expedition of Badr
It is the Badr by appointment [a meeting] which was promised the Battle
of Uhud. Ibn Ishaq said: when Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, returned to Madinah from the expedition of DhaturRiqa‘, he remained there for the remainder of Jumada Al-Oola, Jumaad
132

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Aakhir and Rajab. Then he set out in Sha‘ban to Badr for the
appointment set by Abu Sufyan. Ibn Hisham related: “And he appointed
‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salool over Madinah in his
absence.”
Ibn Ishaq added: The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, encamped
at Badr and remained there for eight days waiting for Abu Sufyan.
Meanwhile, Abu Sufyan also marched out with the forces of Makkah till
they reached Majannah in the direction of Az-Zahran. Some people said
that he reached Usfan. Then he began to feel reluctant and consider
returning home. He said to his men: “O tribe of Quraish! Nothing will
improve the condition you are in but a fruitful year — a year during which
your animals feed on plants and bushes and give you milk to drink. And I
see that this is a rainless year, therefore I am returning now and I
recommend you to return with me.” Then they all returned after becoming
crestfallen.
The people of Makkah nicknamed this army "the army of As-Saweeq"
taunting that they marched forth only to drink As-Saweeq.
Then, Makhshi Ibn Amr Ad-Damri came and he had entered into a pact
with the Prophet at the Battle of Waddan on behalf of Banu Damrah. He
said: “O Muhammad, have you come here this water to confront the
Quraish?” The Prophet replied: “Yes, O brother of Banu Damrah.” If you
wish we shall repudiate the pact between us both so that we may both fight
till Allah decides between us both.” He said: “No, by Allah, we do not
have any need for that.” Then Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, returned to Madinah without a fight.

Aggregate Events that Occurred in the Fourth Year
of Hijrah
Ibn Jareer narrated: In Jumada Al-Oola of the same year, ‘Abdullah Ibn
‘Uthman Ibn Affan died, i.e. the son of Ruqayyah, the daughter of Allah’s
Messenger, may Allah be pleased with him. The boy died at the age of six
and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
offered the funeral prayer on him and his father, ‘Uthman, descended into
his grave (to by his corpse for burial).
133

In The Defence Of the True Faith
The same year, Abu Salamah ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Abdul-Asad Ibn Hilal Ibn
‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Makhzoom Al-Qurashi Al-Makhzoomi died.
His mother was Barrah Bint ‘Abdul-Muttalib, the aunt of Allah’s
Messenger. Abu Salamah was a foster-brother to the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, as they both suckled from
Thuwaibah, the freed slave of Abu Lahab.
Ibn Jareer related: Few nights to the close of the month of Sha‘ban, AlHasan Ibn ‘Ali was born to Fatimah, the daughter of Allah’s Messenger.
The narrator also said that in the month of Ramadan of the same year,
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, married
Zainab Bint Khuzaimah Ibn Al-Harith.
Al-Waqidi said that in the month of Shawwal of the same year, Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, married Umm
Salamah Bint Abi Umayyah.
I say: Prior to marrying the Prophet, Umm Salamah was with the father of
her children, Abu Salamah Ibn ‘Abdul-Asad who had witnessed Badr and
Uhud as pointed out earlier.
Umm Salamah narrated: One day, Abu Salamah returned to me from the
presence of Allah’s Messenger and said: I heard Allah’s Messenger say
that “No misfortune will befall a Muslim if he says at the time of that
misfortune, as Allah has ordered, ‘Inna lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji‘oon.
Allahumma jurni fi museebati, wakhluf li khairan minha’ (To Allah we
belong and to Him we are returning. O Allah, reward me in my misfortune
and give me better than it afterwards) except that Allah will do that for
him.”
Umm Salamah continued: “I memorized that statement from him. So,
when Abu Salamah died, I said the statement to myself: “Where can I find
someone better than Abu Salamah?” After I had completed my waiting
period (iddah), Allah’s Messenger sought my permission to enter. At the
time, I was tanning a leather of mine. I washed my hands from the leaves
(with which I was tanning), then I gave him permission. I spread out for
him a leather cushion filled with fiber and he sat on it. He sought my hand
in marriage. When he concluded his speech, I said to him: “O Allah’s
134

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Messenger, who am I not to have a desire to marry you but I am an
extremely jealous woman, thus, I am scared that you will find in me
something for which Allah might punish me. I am also a woman who has
gathered some ages and I also have dependants.” The Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, responded: “As for what you
mentioned concerning your jealousy, Allah will cure you of it. As for the
age which you have gathered, a similar thing has happened to me too.
With regard to the dependants, whom you mentioned, your dependants
are my dependants as well.” Umm Salamah then said: “I have submitted
myself to Allah’s Messenger.” She then added: “Allah has certainly
replaced for me someone better than Abu Salamah – Allah’s Messenger.”

The Fifth Year of Hijrah, the Expedition of
Dawmatul-Jandal in Rabee‘ ulAwwal
Ibn Ishaq related: Afterwards, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, invaded Dawmatul-Jundal. Ibn Hisham said: It
occurred in Rabee‘ ul-Awwal in the fifth year of Hijrah and he appointed
Siba‘ Ibn ‘Urfutah Al-Ghifari over Madinah.
Muhammad Ibn ‘Umar Al-Waqidi has related it with his chain of
narrations from his teachers from a number of predecessors who said: The
target of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, was the borders of Syria. It was also said that the invasion was to
terrorize Ceasar. The Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him, had been
informed that a large number of soldiers had encamped at DawmatulJandal and were terrorizing everyone that they come across, and that a
large market was located there. He was informed that they are mobilizing
with the intent to invade Madinah. Thus, the Messenger of Allah, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, selected his men and marched out
with one thousand Muslim warriors. They would advance under the cover
of night and rest by day. He had a guide from the Banu Udhrah named
Madhkoor. When they approached Dawmatul-Jandal, the guide informed
him of the location of the pasture of Banu Tameem. They advanced till
they snuck upon their cattles and shepherds. Some were killed and others
scattered in different directions. When the news of the attack reached the
inhabitants of Dawmatul-Jandal, they fled in all directions for their lives
and evacuated their habitations. The Prophet encamped on their public
135

In The Defence Of the True Faith
square but did not find anyone. He stayed there for a few days during
which he dispatched some expeditionary forces and then withdrew.
Muhammad Ibn Salamah captured one of them and brought him to Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. He enquired from
him about the whereabouts of his companions and he disclosed that they
had fled the day before. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, presented Islam to him and he accepted. Then, the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, returned
to Madinah.

The Battle of Khandaq Otherwise Known as the
Battle of the Confederates
The battle took place in the month of Shawwal, fifth year of Hijrah. Ibn
Ishaq related that from ‘Urwah Ibn Az-Zubair, Qatadah, Al-Baihaqi and
more than one scholar among the predecessors and the successors.
From the account of Al-Khandaq is that a group of Jews including Salam
Ibn Abil-Huqaiq An-Nadari, Huyayy Ibn Akhtab An-Nadari, Kinanah Ibn
Abil-Huqaiq, Hawdhah Ibn Qais Al-Wa’ili and Abu ‘Ammar Al-Wa’ili
were there among a group of Banu An-Nadeer and another from Banu
Wa’il. These were the people who rallied the confederates against the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. They went
to the Quraish in Makkah and invited them to a war against the Messenger
of Allah saying: “We shall align with you till we all exterminate him.”
The Quraish said in response: “O Jews, you are the first of the People of
the Book and you possess the knowledge of that which has stirred
disagreement between us and Muhammad. Which religion is better, ours
or his? You are more deserving of the truth than him.” They were the ones
concerning whom Allah revealed: Have you not seen those who were
given a portion of the Book (the Jews), purchasing the wrong path, and
wish that you should go astray from the Right Path. Allah has full
knowledge of your enemies, and Allah is Sufficient as a Wali (Protector),
and Allah is Sufficient as a Helper. (Soorah An-Nisa’ 4:44, 45)
When they presented their proposal to the Quraish, it pleased them and
they were enthusiastic about going to war with Allah’s Messenger, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him. They mobilized and unified their
136

In The Defence Of the True Faith
ranks against him. The same group of Jews also proceeded till they
reached the Ghatafan of Qais Ailan. They invited them to partake in a war
against the Prophet. They also informed them that they were with them in
that cause and that the Quraish were already disposed toward that. They
also rallied with them on that purpose. The Quraish forces commanded by
Abu Sufyan marched out. So did the army of Ghatafan commanded by
seasoned commanders. Uyainah Ibn Hisn Ibn Hudhaifah Ibn Badr led the
contingent of Banu Fazarah; Al-Harith Ibn ‘Awf Ibn Abi Harithah AlMurri commanded Banu Murrah contingent; Mis’ar Ibn Rukhailah Ibn
Nuwairah Ibn Tareef Ibn Suhmah Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn Hilal Ibn Khulawah
Ibn Ashja Ibn Raith Ibn Ghatafan also filed out leading warriors from the
people of Ashja.
When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
heard of their mobilization against him, he dug a trench around Madinah.
Ibn Hisham said: it is said that it was Salman who pointed him to the idea.
Ibn Ishaq related: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, also personally worked in digging the trench in order to
awaken the desire of the Muslims for reward. The Muslims also worked
with him and a party of the hypocrites declined to help, using the excuse
of weakness. There were also those who snuck away with neither his
permission nor his knowledge. Allah had revealed concerning that: The
true Believers are only those, who believe in (the Oneness of) Allah and
His Messenger (Muhammad), and when they are with him on some
common matter, they go not away until they have asked his permission.
Verily! Those who ask your permission, those are they who (really)
believe in Allah and His Messenger. So if they ask your permission for
some affairs of theirs, give permission to whom you will of them, and ask
Allah for their forgiveness. Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
Make not the calling of the Messenger (Muhammad) among you as your
calling of one another. Allah knows those of you who slip away under
shelter (of some excuse without taking the permission to leave, from the
Messenger). And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad)
commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship,
statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief,
trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.)
befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them. Certainly, to Allah
137

In The Defence Of the True Faith
belongs all that is in the heavens and the Earth. Surely, He knows your
condition and (He knows) the Day when they will be brought back to Him,
then He will inform them of what they did. And Allah is All-Knower of
everything. (Soorah An-Noor 24: 62-64)
Humaid related that I heard Anas say: Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, went toward Khandaq (i.e. the Trench)
and saw the Muhajiroon and the Ansar digging in a very cold morning as
they did not have slaves to do that for them. When he noticed their fatigue
and hunger he said, “O Allah! The real life is that of the Hereafter, (so
please) forgive the Ansar and the Muhajiroon.” In its reply the Muhajiroon
and the Ansar said, “We are those who have given a pledge of allegiance
to Muhammad that we will carry on Jihad as long as we live.”
Al-Bukhari related that Sahl Ibn Sa‘d narrated: “We were with Allah’s
Messenger in the Trench, some were digging the Trench while we were
carrying the earth on our shoulders. Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said, ‘O Allah! There is no life except the
life of the Hereafter, so please forgive the Muhajiroon and the Ansar.”
The Hadith is also related by Muslim.
Al-Bukhari related that Al-Bara’ Ibn ‘Azib said: “I saw Allah’s
Messenger on the day (of the Battle) of the Trench carrying earth till the
hair on his stomach was covered with dust and he was reciting the
following Verses: ‘O Allah, were it not for You, We would not have been
guided. Nor would we have given in charity, nor prayed. So, bestow on
us calmness when we meet the enemy. Then make our feet firm, for
indeed, if they want to put us in affliction, (i.e. want to fight against us)
we would not (flee but withstand them).’ The Prophet used to raise his
voice while repeating: ‘we would not (flee but withstand them)’.”
Imam Ahmad related from Anas that Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said, while they were digging the Trench:
“O Allah! There is no goodness except that of the Hereafter, so please set
aright (the affairs of) the Ansar and the Muhajiroon.”
Jabir narrated: We were digging (the Trench) on the day of Al-Khandaq
and we came across a big solid rock. We went to the Prophet and said,
138

In The Defence Of the True Faith
“Here is a rock appearing across the trench.” He said, “I am coming
down.” Then he got up, and a stone was tied to his belly for we had not
eaten anything for three days. So the Prophet took the spade and struck
the big solid rock and it became like sand. I said, “O Allah’s Messenger!
Allow me to go home.” (When the Prophet allowed me) I said to my wife,
“I saw the Prophet in a state that I cannot treat lightly. Have you got
something for him to eat?” She replied, “I have barley and a she goat.” So
I slaughtered the she-kid and she ground the barley; then we put the meat
in the earthenware cooking pot. Then I came to the Prophet when the
dough had become soft and fermented and (the meat in) the pot over the
stone trivet had nearly been well-cooked, and said, “I have got a little food
prepared, so get up O Allah’s Messenger, you and one or two men along
with you (for the food).” The Prophet asked, “How much is that food?” I
told him about it. He said, “It is abundant and good. Tell your wife not to
remove the earthenware pot from the fire and not to take out any bread
from the oven till I reach there.” Then he said (to all his Companions),
“Get up.” So the Muhajiroon and the Ansar got up.
When I came to my wife, I said, “Allah’s Mercy be upon you! The Prophet
came along with the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who were
present with them.” She said, “Did the Prophet ask you (how much food
you had)?” I replied, “Yes.” Then the Prophet said, “Enter and do not
cram.” The Prophet started cutting the bread (into pieces) and put the
cooked meat over it. He covered the earthenware pot and the oven
whenever he took something out of them. He would give the food to his
Companions and take the meat out of the pot. He went on cutting the bread
and scooping the meat (for his Companions) till they all ate their fill, and
even then, some food remained. Then the Prophet said (to my wife), “Eat
and present to others as the people are struck with hunger.” It is
exclusively related by AlBukhari.
Al-Bara’ Ibn ‘Azib Al-Ansari narrated: Allah’s Messenger commanded
us to dig a trench and a rock stood out at a spot in the trench which was
too strong for our spade to break. So we went to complain to Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, about it. He came
to check it. He removed his garment and lowered down to the rock. He
took the spade and struck the rock uttering “In the Name of Allah.” A third
of the rock broke away. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
139

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Allah be upon him, exclaimed: “Allah is the Greatest, the keys of AshSham (Syria) have been given to me. I swear by Allah, I can see its reddish
palaces at the moment from this spot.” Again, upon saying “In the Name
of Allah,” he struck the rock for the second time and another one-third of
the rock broke away. He again exclaimed: “Allah is Greatest, the keys of
Persia have been given to me. I swear by Allah, I can now see the white
palace of Mada’in at the moment from this spot.” For the third time, he
said “in the Name of Allah,” then he struck the rock, which turned into
very small pieces and he said: “Allah is Greatest, I have been given the
keys of Yemen, I swear by Allah, I can see the gates of San‘a while I am
in my place.”
A Companion of the Prophet narrated: When the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered that the Trench be dug,
a rock stalled the digging. So the Prophet rose, took hold of a spade,
removed his upper garment and placed it by the trench and recited: And
the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can
change His Words. And He is the All-Hearer, the AllKnower. (Soorah AlAn‘am 6:115) and one-third of the rock chipped off and Salman Al-Farisi
stood watching as a spark of light shone at the strike of Allah’s Messenger.
Then he struck the rock for the second time while reciting the same Verse
(as the first strike) and another one-third of the rock chipped off. Another
spark of light came out and Salman saw it.
For the third time, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, recited: And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in
truth and in justice. None can change His Words. And He is the AllHearer, the All-Knower. (Soorah Al-An‘am 6:115) and the remaining
third of the rock broke into pieces and the Messenger climbed out of the
trench, took his upper garment and sat down. Salman said: O Allah’s
Messenger, I was watching you while you struck the rock and at each
strike there was a spark of light.” The Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Did you really see that, O Salman?”
and Salman replied: “Yes, by Him Who sent you with the Truth, O
Messenger of Allah.” The Prophet then said: “When I first struck the rock,
I was shown the cities of Kisra (Chosroe) and its adjoining territories.
Mada’in is a large territory till I saw it with my eyes.” His Companions
who were with him asked: “O Messenger of Allah, supplicate that Allah
140

In The Defence Of the True Faith
makes us conquer it, take its descendants as booty and lay waste to their
land at our hands.” The Prophet supplicated for that.
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
continued: “Then I struck it for the second time and I was shown the cities
of Kisra (Caesar) and its adjoining territories till I saw it with my own
eyes.” Again, the Companions requested: “O Messenger of Allah,
supplicate that Allah make us conquer it, take its inhabitants as booty and
lay waste their land at our hands.” The Prophet also supplicated for that.
“Then I struck it for the third time and I was shown the cities of Abyssinia
and its adjoining villages till I saw it with my own eyes.” Then Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Let the
Abyssinians be as long as they let you be. Leave the Turks as long as they
leave you.”
Imam Ahmad related from Abu Hurairah that Allah’s Messenger, peace
be upon him, said: “I have been aided with awe and I have been blessed
with succinct words with deep meanings and the entire Earth has been
made a place of prayer and purification for me. While I was sleeping, the
keys of the Earth’s treasures were brought to me and placed in my hand.”
It is recorded in the Saheehain that Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “When Chosroe (the king of Persia)
dies, there will be no Chosroe after him. And when Caesar (the king of
Rome) dies, there will be no Caesar after him. By the One in Whose Hands
is my life, you will spend their treasures in the cause of Allah.”
In another authentic Hadith, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said: “Allah displayed the Earth for me – the East and
the West and the authority of my Ummah shall extend to what has been
displayed to me.”
Ibn Ishaq related that when the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, completed the digging of the Trench, the Quraish
came and encamped in the vicinity of Madinah in a place called Al-Asyal
with warriors numbering ten thousand from a hotchpotch of tribes and
those who followed them from Banu Kinanah and the people of Tihamah.
141

In The Defence Of the True Faith
The Ghatafan also came with their allies from the people of Najd till they
encamped at Dhanab Naqama close to Uhud.
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, also
came out with the Muslims numbering three thousand. They entrenched
themselves in Sala‘ Mountain with the Trench standing as a barrier
between them and the disbelievers. The Prophet ordered that the children
and women be taken to rooftops. Ibn Hisham said: The Messenger of
Allah, peace be upon him, appointed Ibn Umm Maktoom over Madinah
in his absence. This is the import of Allah’s statement: When they came
upon you from above you and from below you, and when the eyes grew
wild and the hearts reached to the throats, and you were harboring doubts
about Allah. (Soorah Al-Ahzab 33:10)
‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said concerning the Verse: When
they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when the
eyes grew wild and the hearts reached to the throats, and you were
harboring doubts about Allah (Soorah Al-Ahzab 33:10), that it was on the
Day of the Trench.
Ibn Ishaq related that Huyayy Ibn Akhtab An-Nadari approached Ka‘b Ibn
Asad Al-Qurazi, their chief and the most influential person. When Ka‘b
learned of his coming, he locked the gate of his fortress against Huyayy.
Huyayy sought his permission to enter but he refused to open the gate for
him. Huyayy called out: “Woe to you, O Ka‘b, opened the gate for me!”
Ka‘b responded: “Woe to you too, O Huyayy, you portend bad omen. I
have entered into a pact with Muhammad and I am not going to repudiate
the pact between me and him. Leave me as I am for I have always found
him loyal and truthful.” Huyayy persisted: “Woe to you, open the gate for
me so that I may have words with you.” “I will not!” Ka‘b insisted. “By
Allah, you locked your gate against me only because of your Jasheeshah
which you fear that I will eat with you.” The man became enraged and
threw the gate opened for him. When he had entered, Huyayy said: “Woe
to you, O Ka‘b, I have come to present to you perpetual honor and
numerous hosts.” “What is that?” Ka‘b asked. “I have come to you with
the Quraish and its commander and chief and they have encamped at AlAsyal and the Ghatafan are also encamped by Mount Uhud with its
commander and chief. They have agreed not to withdraw until they
142

In The Defence Of the True Faith
exterminate Muhammad and his followers.” Ka‘b said: “By Allah, you
have come to me with a perpetual ignominy.”
Ibn Ishaq said: Huyayy did not cease to cajole Ka‘b till he eventually
managed to win him to his side and persuaded him to break his covenant
with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
and enter into war alongside the confederates.
Ibn Ishaq said: When the news of the intrigue to break the covenant
reached the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, he dispatched Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh, who was at the time the leader of
Aws, Sa‘d Ibn ‘Ubadah, who was at the time the leader of the Khazraj,
along with ‘Abdullah Ibn Rawahah and Khawwat Ibn Jubair, to the Banu
Quraizah on the Day of Ahzab. He gave them clear instruction: “Proceed
to these people and find out whether the news reaching us from them is
true or not. If it is true give me an encrypted message which I can
understand and do not puncture the Muslims' confidence. If they,
however, still conform to their pact with us, declare it publicly to the
people.” The emissaries thus proceeded to meet them.
Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah related: The emissaries entered the fort of the Banu
Qaraizah and invited them to an accord and a renewal of the alignment.
They responded: “Our wing has been broken and they were expelled.” By
that they meant Banu Nadeer. They also poured vituperations against the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him.
Ibn Ishaq related that they spoke disparagingly against the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saying: “Who is the
Messenger of Allah? We do not have any pact or covenant with
Muhammad.” Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh reviled them and they answered him in a
similar manner. He was a man with some fury in him. Sa‘d Ibn ‘Ubadah
said to him: “Stop insulting them for the matter between us and them is
far more serious than insulting them.” The two Sa‘ds withdrew together
with their compatriots and returned to the Prophet. When they got to him,
they said the salam on him and said: “It is like the treachery of Adal and
Al-Qarah toward the people of Ar-Rajee, Khubaib and his companions.”
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Allah is Greatest! O Muslims have glad tidings.”
143

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah narrated: Then Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, covered his head with his cloth when the news was
brought to him and laid down for a long time. The situation became grave
and a sense of fear prevailed when they saw him lying down. It became
clear to them that what came from Banu Quraizah was not good at all.
Then Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, raised
his head and said: “Have glad tidings of Allah’s victory and help.” The
following morning, the enemies started coming one after the other. They
were repelled by showers of arrows and stones. Sa‘eed Ibn Musayyab
related: Allah’s Messenger, peace be upon him, supplicated: “O Allah, I
ask You (to fulfill) Your covenant and promise. O Allah, if You wish (that
the Muslims be destroyed) You will not be worshipped.”
Ibn Ishaq related that the situation became aggravated, and palpable fear
enveloped the Muslims. The enemy inundated them from above and
below them till the Believers began to entertain misgivings in their hearts.
Hypocrisy became rife to such an extent that Mu‘attib Ibn Qushair from
Banu ‘Amr Ibn ‘Awf said: “Muhammad used to give us hope that we
would obtain the treasures of Persians and Romans and now none of us
feels safe even going to the lavatory.” Aws Ibn Qaizi also said to the
Prophet: “O Messenger of Allah, our houses are vulnerable to the enemies
so permit us to go back to our houses for it is outside of Madinah.”
I say: These people and their likes are the subjects of the statement of
Allah: And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease (of
doubts) said: “Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but
delusions!” And when a party of them said: “O people of Yathrib (AlMadinah)! There is no stand (possible) for you (against the enemy attack)!
Therefore go back!” And a band of them ask for permission of the Prophet
saying: “Truly, our homes lie open (to the enemy).” And they lay not
open. They but wished to flee. (Soorah Al-Ahzab 33:12,13)
When the situation became worse on the people, Allah’s Messenger, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, according to what was related to me,
sent ‘Asim Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Qatadah and others to Uyainah Ibn Hisn and
Al-Harith Ibn Awf Al-Murri, both of whom were the commanders of
Ghatafan, offering them a third of Madinah’s fruit crops on condition that
they withdraw with their forces from fighting against the Messenger of
144

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Allah and his Companions. There was a flurry of correspondences and an
unwitnessed agreement was written which yielded no firm results. When
the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, wanted
to carry out the proposal to the Ghatafan, he sent for the two Sa‘ds
(namely, Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh and Sa‘d Ibn ‘Ubadah) and sought their advice.
They replied as follows: “Messenger of Allah! Is this course of action
which you have preferred from Allah’s Injunction such that we do not
have a choice but to obey or is it a new course you want to follow just to
provide security for us?” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, replied: “It is a course of action which I have devised
to provide your security after all the ‘Arabs have shot at you from one
bow, i.e. they have united to annihilate you (Muslims) and they have
hemmed you in from all directions.” Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh said to him: “We
have experienced these people while we were both on polytheism and
idolatry not worshipping Allah and not having any knowledge of Him.
We can safely say that they don’t need the fruit of our orchards, they will
rather aim at exterminating us completely. Is it now that Allah has honored
us with Islam, guided us to Him and ennobled us with your presence that
we should now turn over our wealth to them? We do not have any need
for this. By Allah we should give them nothing except our unsheathed
swords (i.e. fighting) till Allah decides between us and them.”
Ibn Ishaq related that the Prophet and his Companions remained under
siege but there was no serious confrontation between them and their
enemies. Meanwhile, ‘Amr Ibn ‘Abd Wudd had fought in the Battle of
Badr and he had sustained injuries which prevented him from partaking
in the Battle of Uhud. Thus, at the Battle of Khandaq, he marched forth
intending to make a mark of his distinguished position as a seasoned
warrior. When he and his Calvary halted, he challenged anyone to a duel.
“Who will take up my challenge?” he said arrogantly. ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib
stepped out to take up the challenge. When he got to him, ‘Ali said to him:
“O ‘Amr, remember you used to swear by Allah that no Quraishi will
invite you to one of two alternatives except that you will choose one.”
‘Amr replied: “Yes, that is correct.” Then ‘Ali said: “Then I am inviting
you to Allah, His Messenger and to Islam.” ‘Amr said: “I am in no need
of that.” Then ‘Ali said: “Then I am inviting you to a combat.” “Why, my
nephew? By Allah I do not wish to kill you.” ‘Amr said. ‘Ali responded
calmly, “As for me, I swear by Allah, I love to kill you.” This affront
145

In The Defence Of the True Faith
enraged ‘Amr. He hopped down from his horse, hamstrung it and hit its
face, then he approached ‘Ali menacingly. A fierce duel ensued and ‘Ali
succeeded in killing him. May Allah be pleased with ‘Ali.
Then ‘Ali withdrew toward the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, his face radiating with happiness. ‘Umar Ibn AlKhattab said to him: “Why did you not dispossess him of his armor; no
‘Arab has better armor than his.” ‘Ali said: “I broke it and his nakedness
became exposed to me so I became shy of stripping him.” Seeing their
man fall, his Calvary beat a quick retreat across the Trench.
Moosa Ibn ‘Uqbah related that the disbelievers inundated the Muslims till
they were besieged in a fort like situation. The blockade lingered for close
to twenty nights. The Muslims were attacked from all sides till a man
would not know whether he completed his prayer or not. Detachments of
the enemy forces made forays across the Trench. A large detachment
headed in the direction of the Prophet’s residence. The Muslims fought
them throughout the day till nightfall. When the ‘Asr prayer was due, the
enemy detachment advanced and the Prophet and all of his Companions
with him were unable to offer the Salat as they would like to. Eventually,
the enemy detachment retreated by nightfall. Some claim that the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“They (the enemy) have diverted us from the middle prayer till the sunset.
May Allah fill their graves and their houses with fire, or their graves and
stomachs with fire.”
The tribulation became extremely precarious, hypocrisy became rife and
disgusting statements were uttered. When the Messenger of Allah saw the
people’s anguish and tribulation, he kept giving them good tidings,
saying: “By Him in Whose Hands is my soul, the severity of the situation
which you are experiencing right now will soon be relieved. I strongly
hope that I will circumambulate the Ancient House (Baitul-Ateeq) in
security and the keys of the Ka‘bah shall be delivered to me. Allah shall
annihilate Kisra and Qaisar and you will spend their treasures in the path
of Allah.”

146

In The Defence Of the True Faith
‘Ali narrated that the Prophet said, on the Day of Khandaq: “O Allah! Fill
their (i.e. the polytheists’) houses and graves with fire as they busied us
so much that we did not perform the prayer (i.e. ‘Asr) till the sunset.”
Al-Bukhari related from Jabir Ibn ‘Abdullah that on the day of Khandaq,
‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab came after the sun had set, cursing the disbelievers
of Quraish and saying, “O Allah’s Messenger! I have not offered the ‘Asr
prayer and the sun has set.” The Prophet replied, “By Allah! I too, have
not offered the prayer yet." The Prophet then went to Buthan, performed
ablution and performed the ‘Asr prayer after the sun had set and then
offered the Maghreb prayer after it.”
A section of scholars has used this Hadith as evidence that the SalatalWusta (the middle prayer) is the ‘Asr prayer as is related from him in this
Hadith. Al-Qadi and Al-Mawardi have held on to Ash-Shafi’i’s position
due to the authenticity of this Hadith.
We have composed that by way of transmission and deduction while
explaining the words of Allah: Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawat
(the prayers) especially the middle Salat (i.e. the best prayer - ‘Asr). And
stand before Allah with obedience and do not speak to others during the
Salat (prayers.)
A section of scholars has adduced this as evidence for the permissibility
of delaying the Salat due to the excuse of fighting (in war) as opinionated
by Makhool and Al-Awza’i. Al-Bukhari has a chapter heading on that and
adduced this Hadith as evidence and the Messenger of Allah’s statement
on the day he commanded them to advanced to Banu Quraizah as shall be
discussed shortly.
The Prophet said, “None of you (Muslims) should offer the ‘Asr prayer
but at Banu Quraizah’s place.” When the ‘Asr prayer became due, some
of them offered it on the way. Some of them did not offer it till they got
to Banu Quraizah after the sun had gone down and the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, did not berate any one
of the two groups. They also advanced as argument what is reported from
the Companions and those with them during the siege of Tustar in the year
20 A.H. during the time of ‘Umar when they offered the Fajr (early

morning) prayer after the sun had risen due to the excuse of fighting and
the conquest of the fortress was at hand.
Other scholars, who incidentally are in the majority, among whom was
Ash-Shafi’i, however, argued that this act on the day of Khandaq has been
abrogated with the legislation of the "Fear Prayer" afterward. Meanwhile,
it was not legislated prior to that. This is the reason why they delayed the
prayer on that day. This is, however, doubtful. Ibn Ishaq and a group of
scholars hold the opinion that the Prophet offered the "Fear Prayer" at
Usfan and Ibn Ishaq, who is a leader in military history, has situated it in
his narration before the Battle of Khandaq as well as Dhatur-Riqa‘ which
he also situated before Khandaq. And Allah knows best.
As for those who said that the delaying of the Salat on the day of Khandaq
was as a result of forgetfulness as related by some commentators on
(Saheeh) Muslim. This is also doubtful. The probability of that happening
is remote considering their extreme concern for observing Salat. This is
coupled with the fact that it has been reported that they were not able to
offer the Zuhr, ‘Asr and Maghreb prayers on that day till they combined
them all at the time of Isha’.
Imam Ahmad related from ‘Abdur-Rahman Ibn Abi Sa‘eed Al-Khudri
from his father who said: We were bogged down on the day of Khandaq
till a part of the night had gone and we were sufficed, as indicated by the
statement of Allah: And Allah drove back those who disbelieved in their
rage, they gained no advantage (booty, etc.). Allah sufficed for the
believers in the fighting (by sending against the disbelievers a severe wind
and troops of angels). And Allah is Ever All-Strong, Almighty. (Soorah
Al-Ahzab 33:25)

The Messenger of Allah called Bilal and ordered him to announce the
Adhan and then he made the Iqamah and the Prophet offered the Zuhr
prayer as he would do at its proper time. He offered the ‘Asr prayer in a
similar manner. He also offered the Maghreb and Isha’ as he would offer
them in their actual times. This occurred before the revelation of the "Fear
Prayer" as stated by Al-Hajjaj: And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salat
on foot or riding. And when you are in safety, offer the Salat in the manner

He has taught you, which you knew not (before). (Soorah Al-Baqarah
2:239)

The Prophet’s Du‘a against the confederates and how
Allah dealt with them by His Wisdom and Power
Thus Allah cast terror into their hearts; then sent against them tornadoes
which convulsed them.
It is recorded in the Saheehain from ‘Abdullah Ibn Abi Awfa that Allah’s
Messenger supplicated against the Ahzab thus: “O Allah! The Revealer of
the Book, the Swift-Taker of Accounts, defeat the Ahzab (the
Confederates). O Allah, defeat them and convulse them.” In another
version, he said: “O Allah, defeat them and grant us victory over them.”
Al-Bukhari related from Abu Hurairah that Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, used to supplicate thus: “La ilaha ill-Allah
Wahdahu’, A’azza jundahu, wa nasara abdahu wa galabal-azab wahdahu,
fa la shay’a ba’dahu.” (None has the right to be worshipped except Allah,
Alone, (Who) honored His warriors and made His slave victorious, and
He, Alone, defeated the confederates; so there is nothing after Him).
Nu‘aim Ibn Mas‘ood came to Allah’s Messenger, peace be upon him, and
said: “O Messenger of Allah, I have accepted Islam without the
knowledge of my people, so you may command me with whatever you
wish.” The Prophet said: “You are only one man amongst us, so go and
incite distrust among the enemies toward them off us for war is a
stratagem.”
Then Nu‘aim approached Banu Quraizah with whom he had some
comradeship during the Jahiliyyah. He said to them: “O Banu Quraizah,
you are aware of my sympathy for you and the special relation existing
between me and you.” They acknowledge that they did not feel suspicious
toward him. Then Nu‘aim said to them: “The Quraish and the Ghatafan
are not in a similar situation as you. The town is yours which comprises
your properties, children and wives and you cannot abandon them and go
somewhere else. The Quraish and Ghatafan are here to fight Muhammad
and his Companions. You are supporting them against him while their
149

In The Defence Of the True Faith
own town, women and properties are not here, so they are different from
you. If they find an opportunity, they will avail themselves of it but if the
situation goes bad, they will return to their own land and abandon you to
confront the man whom you will not be able to withstand. Do not partake
in the war till you take some of their noblemen as mortgage. Let them be
in your possession as measure of assurance for you and on condition that
you all fight against Muhammad to a logical conclusion.” Quite impressed
by the suggestion, they said: “You have indeed directed us to an intelligent
suggestion.”
Thereafter, Nu‘aim proceeded to the Quraish and said to Abu Sufyan Ibn
Harb and his company from the Quraish: “You are aware of my sympathy
for you and my estrangement from Muhammad. I am privy to a conspiracy
of which I see as rightful for me to inform you as a precaution but keep
this as a secret.” After giving him the assurance of secrecy, Nu‘aim then
said: “The Jews have become regretful of what they have committed
between them and Muhammad. In fact, they have sent a message saying:
‘We deeply regret our action. However, will it please you that we deliver
the leaders of the Quraish and Ghatafan to you so that you may chop off
their necks and then we shall align with you to finish the remainder of
them?’ And he (Muhammad) had sent back a word in appreciation of that.
So, if the Jews request you for some of your noblemen as mortgages, do
not grant them even a single person.”
Then Nu‘aim proceeded to the Ghatafan and said to them, “O people of
Ghatafan, you are of my roots, my family and the most beloved people to
me so I do not feel that you are suspicious of me.” When they
acknowledged their trust in him, he then requested that they be secretive
about the information he intend to grant them. After they had given him
their words, he told them similar to what he told the Quraish and urged
them to take precaution as the Quraish.
On the night of a Saturday in the month of Shawwal, 5th year of Hijrah,
from Allah’s favor to His Messenger was that Abu Sufyan and some
chiefs of the Ghatafan sent ‘Ikrimah Ibn Abi Jahl among other individuals
from the Quraish and the Ghatafan charging them with the message that:
“We cannot stay here forever. The infantry and Calvary are bogged down.
So be prepared to fight along with us till we finish off Muhammad and
150

In The Defence Of the True Faith
what is between us and him is settled once and for all.” Banu Quraizah
also sent a message back, saying: “Today is Saturday which coincides
with a day we do not do anything. Some of us have violated this sacred
day in the past and the consequence of their action is not hidden from you.
Moreover, we will not partake in fighting against Muhammad until you
give us some of your men as mortgage, which shall be an assurance for us
till we fight and uproot Muhammad. We fear that if you begin the war and
there is a negative turn of event, you will then run back to your land and
abandon us to face the man all alone; something we will be unable to
bear.”
When the emissaries returned with the message of Banu Quraizah, the
Quraish said: “By Allah, what Nu‘aim Ibn Mas‘ood said is true.” So they
sent back words, saying: “We shall not release to you a single person from
us, if you really wish to fight, then come out and fight.” When this latest
message reached them, they said: “What Nu‘aim had informed you of is
true. They merely wish to fight if they find an opportunity but if the
situation goes bad, they will return to their own land and abandon you to
confront the man in your own land all alone.” So they sent back a message
to the Quraish and the Ghatafan: “We shall not fight along with you till
you give us a pawn.” They were refused and Allah drove a wedge between
them. Thereafter, He sent against them tornadoes on a wintry and
extremely cold night which kept overturning their cooking pots and
sending their chattels in disarray.
It has been narrated by Ibrahim At-Taimi on the authority of his father
who said: We were sitting in the company of Hudhaifah. A man said, if I
were in the time of the Messenger of Allah, I would have fought by his
side and would have striven hard for his causes. Hudhaifah said: You
might have done that, (but you should not make a flourish of your
enthusiasm). I was with the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, on the night of the Battle of Ahzab and we were
gripped by a violent wind and severe cold. The Messenger of Allah, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Hearken! The man who (goes
reconnoitering and) brings me news of the enemy shall be ranked with me
on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted).” We all kept
quiet and none of us responded to him. (Again) he said: “Hearken! The
man who (goes reconnoitering and) brings me news of the enemy shall be
151

In The Defence Of the True Faith
ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and
Exalted).” Again, we kept quiet and none of us responded to him. He again
said: “Hearken! The man who (goes reconnoitering and) brings me news
of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah
(the Glorious and Exalted).” Then he said: “Get up Hudhaifah, bring me
news of the enemy.” When he called me by name I had no alternative but
to get up. He said: “Go and bring me information about the enemy, and
do nothing that may provoke them against me.” When I left him, I felt
warm as if I were walking in a heated bath until I reached them. I saw Abu
Sufyan warming his back against fire. I put an arrow in the middle of the
bow intending to shoot at him, when I recalled the words of the Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, “Do not provoke them
against me.” Had I shot at him, I would have hit him. But I returned and
(felt warm as if) I were walking in a heated bath (hammam). Presenting
myself before him, I gave him information about the enemy. When I did
so, I began to feel cold, so the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, wrapped me in a blanket that he had in excess to his
own requirement and with which he used to cover himself while saying
his prayers. So I continued to sleep until it was morning. When it was
morning he said: “Get up, O heavy sleeper.”
Al-Hakim and Al-Hafiz Al-Baihaqi related in Aad-Dala’il from ‘AbdulAzeez, the nephew of Hudhaifah, who said: Hudhaifah related some of
the battles they witnessed with the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, and his audience said: “By Allah, had we
witnessed that, we would have done such-and-such (feats of battle).”
Hudhaifah said: “do not wish for that. On the night of the Ahzab, we sat
still while Abu Sufyan and his army among the confederates were above
us and the Jews of Banu Quraizah were below us and we were scared of
them for our progenies. We never witnessed a night worse than that due
to its darkness, violent winds whose sound was dumbfounding. The
darkness was so pitch that each one of could not even see his finger. The
hypocrites were advancing excuses to the Prophet, saying: “Our houses
are exposed,” even though it was not so and there was no one who sought
the permission of Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, except that he permitted him. Some of them sought permission
while some merely snacked away. We were about three hundred men and
we were in that condition when Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
152

In The Defence Of the True Faith
of Allah be upon him, approached us one after the other till he came upon
me while there was nothing shielding me, neither from the enemy nor
from the extreme cold, except a woolen outfit whose length did not go
beyond my knees. The Prophet got to my position while I was kneeling
on my knees. “Who is there?” The Prophet asked. “Hudhaifah,” I replied
recoiling further to the ground. “O Messenger of Allah, I hate to stand
up.” He ordered me to stand up and I obeyed and then he said: “Sneak into
the enemy camp and bring me information.” I was most frightful and
chilly. Nevertheless, I set out and the Messenger supplicated: “O Allah,
protect him from his front behind, right side, his left, from above him and
below him.” Every feeling of fright and chilliness dissipated from me.
When I turned to go, he gave me a terse instruction: ‘O Hudhaifah, do not
do anything in the enemy ranks till you come back to me’.
“I went out till I got near the enemy camp. I beheld the glow of the enemy
campfires. I saw a bulky fellow saying while his hands were upon the fire
and rubbing it against his flank. He was saying: “The Departure! The
Departure!!” Then I returned to the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessing of Allah be upon him, while he was covered in his mantle
praying. By Allah, the moment I came back to Allah’s Messenger, I began
to shiver from the cold and the Prophet beckoned to me with his hand
while he was praying. I drew close to him and he covered me with his
mantle. Whenever a matter becomes aggravated, the Prophet would take
recourse in prayer. I informed him that I left the enemies while they were
ready to depart. Then Allah revealed: O you who believe! Remember
Allah’s Favor to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent
against them a wind and forces that you saw not [i.e. troops of angels
during the Battle of Al-Ahzab (the Confederates)]. And Allah is Ever AllSeer of what you do (Soorah Al-Ahzab 33:9) i.e. all of the Verse up to the
statement of Allah:
And Allah drove back those who disbelieved in their rage, they gained no
advantage (booty, etc.). Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting (by
sending against the disbelievers a severe wind and troops of angels). And
Allah is Ever All-Strong, Almighty (Soorah Al-Ahzab 33:25) meaning
that Allah turned away their enemy from them with a violent wind, which
He sent upon them and forces from the angels and others. “Allah sufficed
for the Believers in the fighting.” i.e. they had no need to clash directly
153

In The Defence Of the True Faith
with the enemies, rather, Allah, the Ever All-Strong, Almighty turned
them away by His Wisdom and Power.
Thus, it is recorded in the Saheehain from Abu Hurairah that Allah’s
Messenger, peace be upon him, used to say: “None has the right to be
worshipped except Allah, Alone, (Who) honored His warriors and made
His slave victorious, and He, Alone, defeated the confederates; so there is
nothing after Him.”
Allah (SWT) says: Allah sufficed for the believers in the fighting.
Indicating that fighting actually took place and the Quraish never returned
to fight against the Muslims again thereafter.
Sulaiman Ibn Surad, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated that Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Right now
we have defeated them; they will never defeat us again.”

The Battle of Banu Quraizah
This (section) includes the severe punishment Allah, the Almighty, meted
out to them (in this world) and His promise of an even more excruciating
one in the Hereafter. All this owing to their disbelief and nullification of
the pact between them and the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, coupled with their allying with the confederates
against him.
Allah The Almighty says: And Allah drove back those who disbelieved in
their rage, they gained no advantage (booty, etc.). Allah sufficed for the
believers in the fighting (by sending against the disbelievers a severe wind
and troops of angels). And Allah is Ever All-Strong, the Almighty. And
those of the people of the Scripture who backed them (the disbelievers)
Allah brought them down from their forts and cast terror into their hearts,
(so that) a group (of them) you killed, and a group (of them) you made
captives. And He caused you to inherit their lands, and their houses, and
their riches, and a land which you had not trodden (before). And Allah is
Able to do all things. (Soorah Al-Ahzab 33:25-27)
154

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Bukhari related that Abdullah Ibn ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with
him, narrated, “Whenever Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, returned from a Ghazwah, Hajj or ‘Umrah, he used to
say Takbeer thrice at every elevation of the ground and then would say:
“None has the right to be worshipped but Allah; He is One and has no
partner. All the kingdoms are for Him, and all the praises are for Him, and
He is Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance, worshipping,
prostrating, and praising our Lord. He has kept up His promise and made
His slave victorious, and He Alone defeated all the clans of (nonbelievers).”
Al-Bukhari also related that ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her,
narrated, “When the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
returned on the day (of the Battle) of Al-Khandaq (i.e. the Trench), he put
down his arms and took a bath. Then Jibraeel, whose head was covered
with dust, came to him saying, “You have put down your arms! By Allah,
I have not put down my arms yet.” “Where (is the new battle front)?”)
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked and
Jibraeel said, “This way,” pointing toward the tribe of Bani Quraizah. So
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, went out
toward them.
Al-Bukhari related: Anas Ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, said,
“As if I am just now looking at the dust rising in the street of Banu Ghanm
(in Madinah) because of the marching of Jibraeel’s regiment when Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, set out to Banu
Quraizah (to attack them).”
Al-Bukhari related that Ibn ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with them both,
said, “On the day of Al-Ahzab (i.e. Clans), the Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said: ‘None of you (Muslims) should offer
the ‘Asr prayer but at the place of Banu Quraizah.’ The ‘Asr prayer
became due on them on the way. Some of them said, “We will not offer it
till we reach it, i.e. the place of Banu Quraizah,” while others said, “No,
we will pray at this spot, for the Prophet did not mean that for us.” Later
on it was mentioned to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, and he did not berate any of the two groups.
155

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Baihaqi also related that ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her,
narrated that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, was once with her in her apartment when a man said the greeting of
peace. “Immediately, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, sprinted to his feet and I also got up in pursuit and it
turned out to be Dihyah Al-Kalbi. The Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said: ‘This is Jibraeel. He has commanded
me to march toward Banu Quraizah. He said: 'You have put down your
arms! As for us, we have not put down ours.
We pursued the polytheists till we reached Hamra’ Al-Asad’.”
That was upon Allah’s Messenger’s return from the Battle of Al-Khandaq.
So the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, rose
quickly and said to his Companions: “I make it incumbent upon you not
to offer the ‘Asr prayer till you reach Banu Quraizah.” The sun had set
before they reached them. A group of the Muslims (on the Prophet’s
errand) said, “The Prophet did not intend that you abandon Salat,” so they
offered the prayer. However, the other group said, “The command of
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, is upon us
and the sin (of contravening it).”
Thus, a party prayed with faith and expectation of reward while the other
refrained with faith and expectation of reward and the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, did not berate any of the two
groups. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, proceeded till he came upon an assembly on his way to Banu
Quraizah. He asked them: “Did (you see) anyone pass by?” They
answered, “It was only Dihyah Al-Kalbi who passed by while riding on a
gray mule, under him was a sheet of brocade.” The Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “That was Jibraeel who has been
sent to shake Banu Quraizah and to cast terror into their hearts.”
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, laid
siege to them and asked his Companions to stand guard for him till he
could make them hear his words. The Prophet, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, called out to them: “O brothers of apes!” They said,
“O Abul-Qasim, you were not a barbarous person.” He besieged them till
they succumbed to the judgment of Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh, may Allah be
156

In The Defence Of the True Faith
pleased with him, for they had been his allies in the past. Sa‘d, may Allah
be pleased with him, gave a judgment concerning them that their fighting
men be killed and their children and women be enslaved. This Hadeeth is
related from ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, as well and others
with numerous good chains.
Moosa Ibn Uqbah said: When ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib, may Allah be pleased
with him, saw Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, coming in his direction, he said, “O Messenger of Allah, return, for
Allah has sufficed you against the Jews.” Meanwhile, ‘Ali, may Allah be
pleased with him, had heard vile comments from them concerning Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and his wives, may
Allah be pleased with them all. ‘Ali detested that Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, should also hear such
comments. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said: “Why are you asking me to go back?” But ‘Ali did not disclose
what he had heard from them. The Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, then said: "Perhaps you have heard
something evil from them concerning me. Proceed, for once the enemies
of Allah see me they will not be able to say any of what you have heard.”
When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
reached their fort, they were at the top of the fortress; he called out at the
top of his voice: “Respond, O Jews! O brethren of apes, Allah has
disgraced you and sent down His indignation on you!”
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, besieged
them for about ten nights with a detachment of Muslims. Allah, the
Almighty, sent back Huyayy Ibn Akhtab into the fort of Banu Quraizah
and Allah cast terror into their hearts and the siege became excruciating
for them. They appealed to Abu Lubabah Ibn Abdul Mundhir, may Allah
be pleased with him, to come to them. They had been allies of the Ansar.
Abu Lubabah said, “I shall not go to them until Allah’s Messenger, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, permits me. “I have permitted you,”
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said.
Abu Lubabah, may Allah be pleased with him, approached them and they
cried out to him saying, “What is your opinion on this matter and what do
157

In The Defence Of the True Faith
you command us (to do)?” Then Abu Lubabah made a signal to his throat
running his finger across it indicating that they will be slaughtered. Abu
Lubabah had barely departed when he realized that a great Fitnah (trial)
had afflicted him. Then he said, “I shall not look into the face of Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, till I offer a sincere
repentance and until Allah, the Almighty, acknowledges it in me.”
Thus, he returned to Madinah and tied himself to a pillar of the mosque.
It is claimed that he remained tied like that for close to twenty nights.
When he noticed the long absence of Abu Lubabah, the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, asked: “Has not Abu
Lubabah concluded (his discussion) with his allies?” Then he was
informed of what had happened and the Prophet, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said: “A trial had befallen him in my absence, had he
come to me I would have sought forgiveness for him but since he has done
this, then I shall not move him from his spot until Allah judges his case as
He wishes.”
Ibn Hisham said: According to what Sufyan Ibn Uyainah narrated from
Isma‘eel Ibn Abu Khalid, from Abdullah Ibn Abu Qatadah, then Allah
revealed: O you who believe! Betray not Allah and His Messenger, nor
betray knowingly your Amanat (things entrusted to you, and all the duties
which Allah has ordained for you. (Soorah Al-Anfal 8:27)
Ibn Hisham said: Abu Lubabah, may Allah be pleased with him, remained
fettered for six nights. All the while, his wife would come to him at each
time of Salat to loosen the rope so that he could pray, afterwards, he would
return to being tied up till Allah, the Almighty, revealed: And (there are)
others who have acknowledged their sins, they have mixed a deed that
was righteous with another that was evil. Perhaps Allah will turn unto
them in forgiveness. Surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
(Soorah At-Tawbah 9:102)
Ibn Ishaq related: In the morning, they (Banu Quraizah) submitted to the
judgment of Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him. Then the Aws were aroused saying, “O Messenger of Allah, they are
our allies and not the Khazraj’s. You are aware of how you have recently
treated their own allies.” By their statement they intended the clemency
158

In The Defence Of the True Faith
granted the Banu Qainuqa‘ when ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy requested it for
them as mentioned earlier.
Ibn Ishaq added: When the ‘Aws said those words to the Prophet, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, he said: “Would you be satisfied if
one of your own tribe gives judgement concerning them?” “Yes,” they
replied. “Then let Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh be the arbiter.” Meanwhile, Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, had taken Sa‘d Ibn
Mu‘adh, may Allah be pleased with him, for treatment in a tent belonging
to a woman from Banu Aslam called Rufaidah located inside the mosque.
The woman used to treat the wounded. When Sa‘d, may Allah be pleased
with him, was appointed as the judge concerning the Banu Quraizah, his
tribesmen came to where he was being treated, lifted him unto a donkey
upon which a leather cushion had been placed, for Sa‘d, may Allah be
pleased with him, was a handsomely corpulent man.
His tribesmen brought him toward the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, while they were saying to him, “O Abu
‘Amr, be nice to your allies for Allah’s Messenger has appointed you so
that you may show some leniency to them.” When they persistently
pestered him with that request, he said, “It is time for Sa‘d, in the cause
of Allah, the Almighty, not to fear the blame of anyone who would
blame.” Hearing these words, one of those who were accompanying Sa‘d
went to the household of Banu ‘Abdul Ashhal to announce the death of
Banu Quraizah before the arrival of Sa‘d, may Allah be pleased with him,
owing to the words he had heard from him.
When Sa‘d, may Allah be pleased with him, reached the location of the
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and the other Muslims,
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Go
to your chief.” The Emigrants said: Allah’s Messenger only addressed the
Ansar but the Ansar believed he intended all the Muslims. So they rose to
him and said, “O Abu ‘Amr, Allah’s Messenger has appointed you in
charge of your allies’ affairs that you may arbitrate concerning them.”
Then Sa‘d, may Allah be pleased with him, said, “Do you make a
covenant with Allah, the Almighty, that you will execute the judgment
that I will pronounce on them?” They said, “Yes.” He added, “And the
one who is here?” looking at the direction of the Prophet, peace and
159

In The Defence Of the True Faith
blessings of Allah be upon him, without mentioning his name out of
veneration. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said, “Yes.” Then Sa‘d, may Allah be pleased with him, said, “My
judgment concerning them is that their men should be killed and (their)
wealth distributed and (their) children and women should be taken as
captives.”
Ibn Ishaq said: ‘Asim Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Qatadah narrated to me from ‘Abdur
Rahman Ibn ‘Amr Ibn Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh from Alqamah Ibn Waqqas AlLaithi that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said to Sa‘d, may Allah be pleased with him: “You have ruled concerning
them with the judgment of Allah from above the seven heavens.”
Imam Ahmad, may Allah have Mercy upon him, related from Abu Sa‘eed
Al-Khudri, may Allah be pleased with him, that the tribe of Quraizah
succumbed to the ruling of Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh, may Allah be pleased with
him. Thus, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
sent for Sa‘d and he came while riding on a camel. When he was close to
the mosque of the Prophet, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, said: “Stand up to meet your chief; or the best of
you.” Then he added: “These people have conceded to your judgment.”
Sa‘d, may Allah be pleased with him, said, “Let us kill their fighting men
and take captives their children and women.” Allah’s Messenger, peace
and blessing of Allah be upon him, commented: “You have adjudicated
with the judgment of Allah.” Or perhaps he said: “You have ruled with
the judgment of the king.”
Ibn Ishaq related: They had said to Ka‘b Ibn Asad while they were being
taken to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
one after the other, “O Ka‘b, what do you think they are doing to us?” He
responded, “Must you demonstrate lack of sense at every moment? Don’t
you see that the caller is unceasing and that each person taken away from
you does not return? By Allah, it (i.e., your fate) is execution.”
The proceedings continued in that manner till they were finished with.
Then Huyayy Ibn Akhtab was brought with his hand tied to his neck with
a string. When he saw Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, he said, “I do not reproach myself for my enmity with you
160

In The Defence Of the True Faith
but whomever Allah, the Almighty, has forsaken will be forsaken.” Then
he turned to the people and said, “O people, there is no problem with the
command (judgment) of Allah, the Almighty. This is a record, a decree
and a massacre which Allah has decreed on the Children of Isra’eel.” Then
he sat down and he was decapitated.
Jabal Ibn Jawwal Ath-Tha‘labee said:
By your life! Akhtab did not reproach himself,
Rather, whomever Allah has forsaken stands forsaken,
He will strive till the soul attains its excuse,
Agitate for every agitator covets prestige
Ibn Ishaq said: Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, had ordered the execution of everyone who had grown (private hairs
– i.e., attained puberty). Shu‘bah Ibn Al-Hajjaaj narrated to me from
Abdul Malik Ibn ‘Umair, from ‘Atiyah Al-Qurazee who said: Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered the
execution of everyone that had attained puberty from Banu Quraizah. I
was a young lad at the time and they discovered that I had not yet attained
puberty so I was
left.”
The compilers of the four Sunans related the Hadeeth from Abdul Malik
Ibn ‘Umair from ‘Atiyah AlQurazee with similar wordings. Based on this
Hadeeth, some of the scholars hold the opinion that the growth of hair in
the pubic area is a sign of puberty. In fact, it is puberty based on the more
authentic of the two opinions of Ash-Shafi‘i and there are scholars who
differentiate the boys of the Ahl Dhimmah. Thus, it is puberty in respect
of them to the exclusion of others, for the Muslim will be hurt by that (i.e.
checking the pubic area).
Ibn Ishaq also related from ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, that
she said: “None of their women were killed except one.” She added: “By
Allah, she was conversing with me and she laughed boisterously while
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was
161

In The Defence Of the True Faith
executing her men in the marketplace. Then a caller called out her name,
'Where is such and such woman?’ She answered, ‘I am, by Allah.’ I said
to her, ‘Woe, what be fell you?’ She said, ‘I will be executed.’ ‘For what?’
I asked and she said, ‘For a crime which I have committed’.” Then she
was taken away and decapitated. ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her,
used to say: “By Allah I never ceased to marvel at her. She was good
natured and she laughed a lot even while she knew she was going to be
executed.” This is how Imam Ahmad, may Allah have Mercy upon him,
has related it from Ya‘qoob Ibn Ibraheem from his father from
Muhammad Ibn Ishaq.
Ibn Ishaq said: Afterward, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, divided up the wealth, women and children of Banu
Quraizah among the Muslims after taking the Khumus (one-fifth). He
gave three portions to the horsemen, two for the horse and one for the
rider; he gave one portion to the infantry. The horses on that day numbered
thirty-six.

The Death of Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh
Ibn Ishaq related: After he had dispensed with the matter of the Banu
Quraizah, the wound of Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh, may Allah be pleased with him,
relapsed and consequently, he was martyred. Ibn Ishaq added: Mu‘adh Ibn
Rifa‘ah Az-Zurqee narrated to me saying: One whom I trust of my people
informed me that Jibraeel came to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, donning a turban of brocade when the soul of Sa‘d
bin Mu‘adh, may Allah be pleased with him, was taken in the middle of
the night and asked: “O Muhammad who is this corpse for whom the
heavens were opened and for whom the Throne shook?” The Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, got up hurriedly
dragging his cloth and proceeded towards Sa‘d, may Allah be pleased with
him, and he found that he had died, may Allah be pleased with him.”
Imam Ahmad and An-Nasa’i related from Jabir, may Allah be pleased
with him, who said, “Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said to Sa‘d, may Allah be pleased with him, on the day of his
death while he was being buried: “Glory be to Allah for this righteous
slave for whom the Throne of Ar-Rahman (Allah) shook and for whom
162

In The Defence Of the True Faith
the doors of heaven were thrown open. He was pressed and then Allah
relieved him.”)
I say: This Hadith has been related by Imam Ahmad, may Allah have
mercy upon him, from ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, from the
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, that: “There is a
squeezing in the grave, if anyone could have escaped it, it would have
been Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh.”
Al-Hafiz Al-Bazzar related from Ibn ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with
them both, who said: Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, said: “The day Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh died, seventy thousand angels
descended and they had never descended (to the earth) before that day and
the grave squeezed him briefly.”
Al-Bukhari related that Jabir, may Allah be pleased with him, said, “I
heard the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saying: “The
Throne (of Allah) shook at the death of Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh.” A man said to
Jabir: “Al-Bara’ Ibn ‘Azib, may Allah be pleased with him, says that the
Throne shook.” He said: I heard Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, saying: “The Throne of the Most Compassionate
shook because of the death of Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh.”
Al-Hafiz Al-Bazzar related from Anas, may Allah be pleased with him,
who said, “When the bier of Sa‘d was lifted, the hypocrites said, ‘How
light is his bier!’ they said this owing to his judgment concerning Banu
Quraizah, so the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, was asked and he responded: “Rather, it is the angels who are
lifting him.” Its chain of narration is good.
Benefit: Shaikh Abu ‘Umar Ibn Abdul-Barr commented: The Hadeeth of
the shaking of the Throne is well-established and recurrent. As-Suhaili
said: The group related it from some Companions among whom were
Jabir, Abu Sa‘eed, Usaid Ibn Hudair, Rumaithah Bint Amr and added, “It
is understood in the literal sense for it is not impossible for the Throne to
move or shake.” However, as for what is related from Malik concerning
its weakness and his amazement at its narration; perhaps that is not
authentically related from him, and Allah (SWT) knows best.
163

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Bukhari related from Abu Ishaq: I heard Al-Bara’ Ibn Azib, may Allah
be pleased with him, saying, “A silken cloth was given as a present to the
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. His Companions
started touching it and admiring its softness. The Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Are you admiring its softness? The
handkerchiefs of Sa‘d Ibn Mu‘adh (in Paradise) are better and softer than
this.”

What the Poets Said Concerning the Khandaq and
Banu Quraizah
Al-Bukhari related that Al-Bara’ Ibn ‘Azib, may Allah be pleased with
him, said, the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to
Hassan, may Allah be pleased with him: “Lampoon them for Jibraeel is
with you.” It is also related from Al-Bara’ Ibn ‘Azib, may Allah be pleased
with him, who said: The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said to Hassan Ibn Thabit, may Allah be pleased with him, on the
day of the incident of Banu Quraizah: “Lampoon the Mushrikeen for
Jibraeel is with you.”
Ibn Ishaq, Allah have mercy on him, related: Dirar Ibn Al-Khattab Ibn
Mirdas from Banu Maharib Ibn Fihr among the people said on the Day of
Khandaq: that was prior to his acceptance of Islam:
They have tolerated several thoughts concerning us
While we had led strong battalions
Whose number is as great as Uhud
When its different sides appear to spectators
You will see the bodies of heroes fully harmed with impregnable shield
Branded horses like spears directed at misguided and sinful ones
In our hands are sharp swords with which we strike the
forelocks and (decide) matters
164

In The Defence Of the True Faith
It is like a blazing (light) when it is bared in the hands
of its wielders
As the blazing of an agate in the night
You will see in it a clear gemstone
Were it not for the trench with him
We would have wreaked havoc on them all
Then Ka‘b Ibn Malik from Banu Salimah, may Allah be pleased with him,
responded to him thus:
Questioner is asking what we encountered, if she had witnessed it, she
would have see us persevering
We were persevering not finding any equal for Allah
Over what befell us, we were reliant (on Allah)
We have a Prophet who is a truthful vizier
With him we shall overcome all the creation
We will fight against oppressive and disobedient folk
They were watching with enmity
On our right hands are light white (swords)
With which we deal with the exultation of
trouble makers
By the gate of the two trenches as if manned my lions
With fangs protecting the den
The people of Makkah know when they came by
165

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Confederates came in groups
That Allah has no partner
And that Allah is the Protector of the believers
Even if you killed Sa‘d impudently
Allah is the best of the powerful
He will admit him into Excellent Gardens
Which will be an abode for the righteous
As you were repulsed in your anger, defeated, disgraced and
unsuccessful
A disgrace which denude you of any success there at
And you were on the verge of destruction
By a violent wind which descended on you
You were under it like the blind

Assassination of Abu Rafi‘ Salam Ibn Abu Al-Huqaiq
the Jew, May Allah Curse Him
When he had dispensed with the affairs of both the Battle of Khandaq and
that of Banu Quraizah, the Khazraj obtained the permission of Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, to assassinate Abu
Rafi‘ Sallam Ibn Abu Al-Huqaiq at Khaibar. He was part of the
confederates that besieged Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him. Meanwhile, the Aws had undertaken the assassination
of Ka‘b Ibn Al-Ashraf before the Battle of Uhud.
Al-Bukhari related that Al-Bara’ Ibn ‘Azib, may Allah be pleased with
him, narrated that Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, sent some men from the Ansar to (kill) Abu Rafi‘, the Jew, and
166

In The Defence Of the True Faith
appointed ‘Abdullah Ibn Ateek, may Allah be pleased with him, as their
leader. Abu Rafi‘ used to slander Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, and aid his enemies against him. He lived in his
castle in the land of Hijaz. When those men approached (the castle) after
the sun had set and the people had brought back their livestock to their
homes, ‘Abdullah (Ibn Ateek) said to his companions, “Sit down at your
places. I am going, and I will try to play a trick on the gatekeeper so that
I may enter (the castle).”
So ‘Abdullah proceeded toward the castle, and when he approached the
gate, he covered himself with his clothes, pretending to answer the call of
nature. The people had gone in, and the gatekeeper (considered ‘Abdullah
as one of the castle’s servants) addressed him saying, “O Allah’s Servant!
Enter if you wish, for I want to close the gate.” ‘Abdullah continued, “So
I went in (the castle) and hid myself. When the people got inside, the
gatekeeper closed the gate and hung the keys on a fixed wooden peg. I got
up and took the keys and opened the gate. Some people were staying late
at night with Abu Rafi‘ for a pleasant night chat in a room of his.
“When his companions of nightly entertainment went away, I ascended to
him, and whenever I opened a door, I closed it from inside. I said to
myself, ‘Should these people discover my presence, they will not be able
to catch me till I have killed him.’ So I reached him and found him
sleeping in a dark house amidst his family, I could not recognize his
location in the house. So I shouted, ‘O Abu Rafi‘!’ Abu Rafi‘ and he said,
‘Who is it?’ I proceeded towards the source of the voice and hit him with
the sword, and because of my anxiety, I could not kill him. He cried
loudly, and I came out of the house and waited for a while, and then went
to him again and said, ‘What is this voice, O Abu Rafi‘?’ He said, ‘Woe
to your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a sword! I again hit
him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the sword
into his belly (and pressed it through) till it touched his back, and I realized
that I had killed him.
“I then opened the doors one after the other till I reached the staircase, and
thinking that I had reached the ground, I stepped out and fell down and
got my leg broken in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a turban and
proceeded on till I sat at the gate, and said, ‘I will not go out tonight till I
167

In The Defence Of the True Faith
know that I have killed him.’ So, when (early in the morning) the cock
crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on the wall saying, ‘I
announce the death of Abu Rafi‘, the merchant of Hijaz’. Thereupon I
went to my companions and said, ‘Let us save ourselves, for Allah has
killed Abu Rafi‘.’ So I (along with my companions proceeded and) went
to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and related the
whole story to him. He said: “Stretch out your (broken) leg”. I stretched
it out and he rubbed it and it became as if I had never had any problem
with it.”

The Assassination of Khalid Ibn Sufyan Ibn Nubaih
Al-Hudhali
Imam Ahmad, may Allah have Mercy upon him, related from Ibn
‘Abdullah Ibn Unais who reported from his father that Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, invited me and said:
“Information has reached me that Khalid Ibn Sufyan Ibn Nubaih AlHudhali is rallying people in order to raid me and he is currently at
Uranah, so go and assassinate him.” (On hearing this) I said, ‘O Allah’s
Messenger, describe his features to me so that I may recognize him (when
I see him).’ So he said: “Once you see him, you will feel some tremor
from sighting him.” So I proceeded with my sword till I got to him at
Uranah at the time of the ‘Asr prayer. When I saw him, I experienced the
chill as described to me by Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him.
I went toward him but I was afraid that there might be some exchanges of
blows between me and him which might engage me beyond the time of
Salat so I prayed while I was walking toward him, nodding my head to
indicate Rukoo’ (bowing) and Sujood (prostration). When I got to him, he
asked, “Who are you?” “One of the Arab tribes,” I said and added, “I heard
about you and your mobilization against this man and I have come to you
for that purpose,” I said. He responded, “Good, I am truly involved in that
cause.” I walked with him for a while till I got the opportunity and I bared
my sword against him till I killed him and then I withdrew.
When I returned to Allah’s Messenger and he saw me, he said: “This
(face) has attained success.” “I have killed him, O Allah’s Messenger.” I
168

In The Defence Of the True Faith
said and he responded: “You have spoken the truth.” The Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, stood with me for a
while and then took me to his house and presented me a rod and said:
“Keep this with you, O Abdullah Ibn Unais.”
Then I went out with it to the people and they queried, “What is this rod
for?” I said, “Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, gave
it to me and commanded me to keep it.” They said, “Why don’t you go
back and ask him concerning it?” So I returned to Allah’s Messenger and
asked, “O Allah’s Messenger, why did you give me this rod?” He said: “It
is a sign between me and you on the Resurrection, on that day very few
people will be able to rely on their good deeds.”
He (the narrator) added: So ‘Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with him,
paired the rod with his sword and it did not cease to be with him even at
his death, it was enshrouded with him and he was buried like that
together.”

The Encounter of ‘Amr Ibn Al-‘As With Najashi and
His Acceptance of Islam
‘Amr Ibn Al-‘As, may Allah be pleased with him, narrated: When we
departed on the day of Ahzab from the Trenches, I gathered some men
among the Quraish who usually shared my opinion and lent their ears to
me and I said to them, “You all know that by Allah, the matter of
Muhammad is gaining the upper hand in a most hateful manner and right
now, I am nursing a thought and I would like to know your opinion on it.”
“What is your thought?” they asked and I said, “I think we should go to
Najashi and stay with him. If Muhammad eventually prevails over our
people, we will remain with Najashi for to remain under his authority is
far more beloving than to remain under the rule of Muhammad. However,
if it is our people that eventually prevail, we are already well known to
them, so nothing will come to us from them except good.” They
responded, “This is indeed a brilliant suggestion.” So I said, “Let us gather
presents for him and the best souvenir to present to him from our land is
leather.”

169

In The Defence Of the True Faith
So we gathered a large quantity of leather and we proceeded till we
arrived in his presence. By Allah, we were still with him when ‘Amr Ibn
Umayyah Ad-Damri, may Allah be pleased with him, came to him on an
errand from the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, concerning Ja‘afar and his companions. He went in to see
Najashi and came out. So I said to my companions, “This is Amr bin
Umayyah, once I enter the presence of Najashi I shall ask him to hand
him over to me so that I may chop off his neck. Once I have done that,
the Quraish will be gratified that I have taken revenge on their behalf
with the killing of Muhammad’s messenger.
So I entered his presence and prostrated to him as I used to do. He said,
“Welcome, my friend. Have you brought any present for me from your
land?” I said, “Yes, O king, I have brought for you a large quantity of
leather.” So I presented it to him and he marveled at its beauty and loved
it. Then I said to him: “O king, I have seen a man coming out of your
palace, he is a messenger for a man who is our enemy, hand him over to
me so that I may kill him. He has killed a number of our noblemen and
elites.”
The narrator added: Then he (Najashi) became extremely angry. He
stretched his hand and hit his nose so violently that I thought he had
broken it. At that time, if the ground had cleaved I would have entered
into it in flight from him. Then I said, “O king, by Allah, had I thought
you would detest that, I would not have requested you to hand him over
to me.” Then he said, “Do you ask me to hand over to you the messenger
of a man who is visited by the same great Namoos that visited Moosa for
you to kill?”
Then I said, “O king, is he truly as you have said?” He replied, “Woe be
unto you, O Amr, obey me and follow him, for by Allah he is upon the
truth. Moreover, he will prevail over whoever opposes him just as Moosa
bin Imran prevailed over Fir‘awn and his army.” Then I said, “Will you
then take my allegiance to him upon Islam on his behalf?” He obliged and
then stretched out his hand and I pledged allegiance to him upon Islam
and thereafter, I took my leave and returned to my companions after my
mind had changed from its previous thought. I hid my acceptance of Islam
from my companions.
170

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Thereafter, I decided to go to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, to formally proclaim Islam at his hands. On the way,
I met Khalid Ibn al-Waleed, may Allah be pleased with him, on his way
out of Makkah and that was just shortly before the Conquest (of Makkah).
So I said, “Where to, O Abu Sulaiman?” He said, “By Allah, the sign has
become evident that the man is indeed a Prophet, so, by Allah, I am going
to declare my Islam.” I said, “By Allah, I also came for no other purpose
then to accept Islam.”
So we both arrived at the presence of the Prophet, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, in Madinah and Khalid Ibn Al-Waleed, may Allah be
pleased with him, stepped forward and declared his acceptance of Islam
and pledged his allegiance. Then I also moved close to the Prophet, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, and said, “O Messenger of Allah, I
will pledge my allegiance to you upon the condition that you forgive all
that has preceded of my sins and I do not mention the later ones.” Then
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “O
‘Amr, pledge your allegiance, for Islam obliterates all (sins) that came
before it.”
‘Amr, may Allah be pleased with him, continued, “Then I pledged
allegiance and thereafter I departed.” Ibn Ishaq related: I have been
informed from impeccable sources that ‘Uthman Ibn Talhah Ibn Abi
Talhah, may Allah be pleased with him, was with both of them.
I say: Their acceptance of Islam occurred after the Treaty of AlHudaybiyah and at the time, Khalid Ibn Al-Waleed, may Allah be pleased
with him, was with the Calvary of the Mushrikeen as shall be elucidated
in due course. The mentioning of his acceptance of Islam thereafter flows
better. We only mentioned it in following Imam Muhammad Ibn Ishaq,
may Allah have Mercy on him, because the first time ‘Amr Ibn Al-‘As,
may Allah be pleased with him, went to Najashi was after the Battle of
Khandaq. Obviously, he went within the last five years. And Allah knows
best.

In The Defence Of the True Faith

The Prophet’s Marriage to Umm Habeebah Ramlah
Bint Abu Sufyan
Al-Baihaqi related, after (relating the) incident of Al-Khandaq, through
Al-Kalbi from Abu Saleh from Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with
them both, who said while commenting on the Verse: Perhaps Allah will
make friendship between you and those whom you hold as enemies.
(Soorah Al-Mumtahinah 60:7):
“That was concerning the Prophet’s marriage to Umm Habeebah Bint
Abu Sufyan, may Allah be pleased with her, so she became one of the
Mothers of Believers and Mu‘awiyah, may Allah be pleased with him,
became the Uncle of the Believers.”
Umm Habeebah, may Allah be pleased with her, narrated that she was
married to ‘Ubaidullah Ibn Jahsh and he traveled to Najashi but died. Thus
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, married
Umm Habeebah, may Allah be pleased with her, while she was in
Abyssinia and Najashi married her to him. Her Mahr was four thousand
dirhams. She was sent with Shurahbil Ibn Hasanah, may Allah be pleased
with him, and all her essentials were supplied by Najashi. The Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, did not send anything
to her. He (the reporter) added, “Meanwhile, the Mahr of the Prophet’s
wives was four hundred.”
The more authentic view is that the Mahr of the Prophet’s wives was
twelve uqiyyah and nasha (uqiyyah and a waqiyyah equals forty dirhams
and a nash is half a dirham) totaling five hundred dirhams.
I say: The representative of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, in accepting the marriage was Najashi, the king of Abyssinia,
as related by Yoonus from Muhammad Ibn Ishaq: Abu Ja‘far Muhammad
Ibn ‘Ali Ibn Al-Husain narrated to me that: Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, sent ‘Amr Ibn Umayyah Ad-Damri, may
Allah be pleased with him, to Najashi and he married Umm Habeebah to
him and paid four hundred deenars on his behalf.

172

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Al-Hafiz Ibn Al-Atheer says in Usdul-Ghabah, relating from Qatadah, that
when Umm Habeebah, may Allah be pleased with her, migrated from
Abyssinia to Madinah, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, sought and married her. It is also related from some of them
that he (the Prophet) married her after her father’s acceptance of Islam
after the Conquest (of Makkah). This opinion adduced as evidence what
is related by Muslim from Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with them
both, that Abu Sufyan said, ‘O Messenger of Allah grant me three things
and the Prophet said: ‘Yes’. ‘Make me the commander (of the Muslim
army) so that I may fight against the disbelievers as I fought against the
Muslims.’ He said: ‘Yes.’ And he (Abu Sufyan) again said, ‘Accept
Mu‘awiyah to serve as your scribe.’ The Prophet, peace and blessing of
Allah be upon him, said: ‘Yes’. He (further) said, ‘I have with me the best
and most pretty (woman) of all the Arabs, Umm Habeebah, daughter of
Abu Sufyan; I marry her to you’, whereupon he said: ‘Yes’.
Ibn Atheer said: This Hadith is from the ones over which Muslim is
criticized for when Abu Sufyan, may Allah be pleased with him, came to
renew the contract just before the conquest of Makkah, he visited his
daughter Umm Habeebah, may Allah be pleased with her, and she
snatched the Prophet’s cushion from underneath him. He said, “My
daughter, do you consider this bed unfit for me (i.e., my status) or me unfit
for it?” She said, “It is the bed of Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
be upon him, and you are an unclean polytheist.” He said, “My daughter,
you have been afflicted with evil after (you left) me.”
Ibn Hazm said: This Hadith is fabricated by ‘Ikrimah Ibn Ammar but this
statement is unacceptable. Others say that he intended to renew the
marriage contract due to its occurrence without his permission which
constituted a blemish for him. Some others say: He believed that the
marriage of his daughter was nullified with his own acceptance of Islam.
All of these are however weak. The better view is that he wanted to marry
to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, another
daughter of his, ‘Azzah, due to the honor that would accrue to him and a
recourse to her sister, Umm Habeebah, as related in the Saheehain and
that is a misconception on the part of the narrator for mentioning Umm
Habeebah. We have cited a report in corroboration of that.
173

In The Defence Of the True Faith

The Prophet’s Marriage to Zainab Bint Jahsh Ibn
Ri’ab Ibn Ya‘mar Ibn Sabirah Ibn Murrah Ibn
Kabeer Ibn Ghanm Ibn Doowdan Ibn Asad Ibn
Khuzaimah Al-Asadiyyah
Allah, the Almighty, says: And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid
Ibn Harithah, the freed-slave of the Prophet) on whom Allah has bestowed
Grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad too) have done
favor (by manumitting him) "Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allah."
But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to
you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make
manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., Muhammad married the divorced
wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you
should fear Him.
So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her),
We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no
difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their
adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have
divorced them). And Allah's Command must be fulfilled. There is no
blame on the Prophet in that which Allah has made legal for him. That has
been Allah's Way with those who have passed away of (the Prophets of)
old. And the Command of Allah is a decree determined. (Soorah AlAhzab 33:37,38)
The one on whom Allah, the Almighty, bestowed Grace here is Zaid Ibn
Al-Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, the freed slave of the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him. Allah
bestowed Grace on him with Islam and the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, bestowed Grace on him by manumitting
and marrying him to his aunt’s daughter, Zainab Bint Jahsh, may Allah be
pleased with her. Maqatil Ibn Hayyan related, “The amount of dowry he
paid to her was ten deenar, sixty dirham, a face veil, a blanket, a shield,
fifty measures of food and ten measures of dates.”
She was married to him for close to a year or a little more than a year and
then strife erupted between both of them. Her husband came to the
174

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
complaining about his wife and the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, kept telling him: “Keep your wife to yourself, and fear
Allah.”
Allah, the Almighty, says: You did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has
already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that
which Allah will make manifest. (Soorah Al-Ahzab 33:37)
‘Ali Ibn Al-Husain Zainul-‘Abideen and As-Suddi said: Allah, the
Almighty, had already informed him that she would be one of his wives
and that is what he, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, hid in his heart. Many of the predecessors have commented on
this matter relating strange narrations some of which contain some doubts.
We have deliberately omitted them.
Allah says: So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e.,
divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage (Soorah Al-Ahzab 33:37)
meaning that when Zaid divorced his wife and after she had concluded
her waiting period, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, sent a message seeking her hand in marriage for himself. Then
she married him. The One Who married her [to the Prophet] was the Lord
of the Worlds, the Exalted and Sublime. This is confirmed in Saheeh
AlBukhari from Anas Ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him, that
Zainab Bint Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with her, used to boast to the
other wives of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and
used to say: “Your families married you, but Allah married me (to the
Prophet) from above the seven Heavens.”
It is concerning her that the Verse of Al-Hijab (veil) was revealed: O you
who believe! Enter not the Prophet’s houses, except when leave is given
to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation.
(Soorah Al-Ahzab 33:53)
Imam Ahmad, may Allah have Mercy upon him, related from Anas, may
Allah be pleased with him, that when Zainab’s waiting period was over,
the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to Zaid: “Go
and mention me to her.” So he proceeded till he got to her while she was
175

In The Defence Of the True Faith
kneading her dough. He said, “The moment I saw her, she became great
in my heart till I could no longer bear to look at her given that the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, had
mentioned her.” So I turned my back to her and retreated on my heels and
I said, “O Zainab, glad tidings! Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
be upon him, has mentioned you (i.e., for a proposal of marriage).’ She
said, “I am not going to do anything till my Lord commands me.” Then
she stood in her prayer spot and then Allah, the Almighty, revealed the
Qur’an and Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
came and entered upon her without seeking permission.
Anas, may Allah be pleased with him, added, “After Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings be upon him, consummated his marriage with her, he
fed us bread and meat. When the people left, some men remained behind
in the house chatting after the meal so the Prophet, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, went out, and I followed him, and he went round the
dwelling place of his wives saying the greeting of peace to them and they
would respond, “Peace and the mercy of Allah be on you too. How did
you find your wife?” I do not remember whether I was the one who
informed him that the people had left or someone else informed him. Then
he returned to his apartment and I wanted to enter along with him but he
drew the curtain between me and him, and then the Verse of Al-Hijab was
revealed and the people were admonished: Enter not the Prophet’s houses,
except when leave is given to you for a meal. (Soorah Al-Ahzab 33: 53)

The Revelation of the Verse of Hijab on the Morning
of Her Wedding Ceremony
The verse of Hijab was appropriately revealed at the time of this wedding
as a protection for her and her sisters among the Mothers of Believers.
This is consistent with the opinion of Al-Umari.
Al-Bukhari related that Anas Ibn Malik, may Allah be pleased with him,
narrated: When Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, married Zainab Bint Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with her, he invited
the people for a meal and they remained sitting and talking. The Prophet,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, pretended to be ready to get
up, but the people did not get up. When he noticed that, he got up, and
176

In The Defence Of the True Faith
when he had got up, some of those people got up along with him and there
remained three (who kept on sitting). Then the Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, came back and found those people still
sitting. Later on those people got up and went away. So I went to the
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and informed him that
they had left. The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
came and entered (his house). I wanted to enter (along with him) but he
drew a curtain between me and him and then Allah, the Almighty,
revealed: O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet’s houses, except when
leave is given to you for a meal. (Soorah Al-Ahzab
33: 53)

The Sixth Year of Hijrah
The Ghazwah of Dhi Qarad
Ibn Ishaq related: Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, returned to Madinah but he did not stay more than a few nights
before Uyainah Ibn Hisn Ibn Hudhaifah Ibn Badr Al-Fazari, commanding
a Calvary from Ghatafan, raided the camels of the Prophet, peace and
blessings be upon him, at the outskirts (of the town). A man from Banu
Ghifar and his wife were present, so they killed the man and kidnapped
the woman along with the camels.
Al-Bukhari has placed the occurrence of the Ghazwah of Dhi Qarad which
is the Ghazwah in which the camels of Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, were raided after the Treaty of AlHudaybiyah and three (years) before Khaibar. Salamah Ibn Aal-Akwa‘,
may Allah be pleased with him, narrated: Once I went (from Madinah)
toward (Al-Ghabah) before the first Adhan of the Fajr Prayer. The shecamels of Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
used to graze at a place called Dhi Qarad. A slave of Abdur-Rahman Ibn
Awf, may Allah be pleased with him, met me (on the way) and said, “The
she-camels of Allah’s Messenger have been taken away by force.” I asked,
“Who has taken them?” He replied “(The people of) Ghatafan.” I made
three loud cries (to the people of Madinah) saying, “O Sabahah!” I made
the people between the two mountains of Madinah hear me. Then I rushed
onward and caught up with the robbers while they were watering the
camels. I started shooting arrows at them as I was a good archer, while
saying, “I am the son of Al-Akwa‘, and today I will cause the wicked
people to perish.”
I kept on saying that till I restored the she-camels (of the Prophet), I also
snatched thirty Burdah (i.e., garments) from them. Then the Prophet,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and the other people came
there, and I said, “O Allah’s Prophet! I have stopped the people (of
Ghatafan) from taking water and they are thirsty now, so send (some
people) after them now.” On that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, said: “O son of Al-Akwa‘! You have overpowered them, so
forgive them.” Then we all came back and Allah’s Messenger, peace and
178

In The Defence Of the True Faith
blessings be upon him, made me sit behind him on his she-camel till we
entered Madinah.
Imam Ahmad, may Allah have Mercy upon him, related that Imran Ibn
Husain, may Allah be pleased with him, said, “Al-Adba’ belonged to a
man of Banu Uqail. The she-camel used to be in the vanguard of Hajj. The
man was captured and Al-Adba’ was taken along with him. Then Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, met him while he
was in shackles and the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, was riding a donkey with a velvet sheet spread on its back. The man
said, ‘O Muhammad, why did you arrest me as well as the vanguard of
pilgrimage (referring to the she-camel)?’ The Messenger of Allah, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, responded: “We arrested you for the
crime of your allies, Thaqeef.”
At the time, the Thaqeef had captured two men from the Companions of
the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him. According to a report, the
man then said, ‘I am a Muslim.’ The Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Had you said this while you were
free and had choice, you would have enjoyed all success.” Then the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, proceeded.
Then the man said, ‘O Muhammad, I am hungry, give me food and I am
thirsty, give me drink.’ The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, asked him: “Is this all you need?” Afterwards, he was
swapped with the two men and the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, kept al-Adba’ with him as part of his
mounts.
He said: Then the Mushrikoon raided the grazing land of Madinah and
they ran away with the camels and Al-Adba’ was among them. A Muslim
woman was also taken prisoner. The woman had been tied with ropes. The
people were giving rest to their animals before their houses. After they
had gone to sleep, she escaped one night from the bondage and came to
the camels. As she drew near the camels, they fretted and fumed and so
she left them until she came to Al-Adba’. It did not fret and fume; it was
docile so she rode upon its back and drove it towards Madinah. She (the
woman) took a vow that if Allah, the Almighty, saved her upon its back
she would slaughter it as a sacrifice. As she reached Madinah, the people
179

In The Defence Of the True Faith
recognized the she-camel and said, ‘Here is the camel of Allah’s
Messenger!’ Then the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said: “What a bad way to reward it or how ill she rewarded it! Allah saved
her on its back and then you would slaughter it!” He also added: “There
is no fulfillment of the vow in an act of disobedience to Allah, nor in an
act over which a person has no control. ”

Ghazwah Banu Al-Mustaliq of Khuza‘ah
Al-Bukhari says: It is (also) known as the Battle of Al-Muraisi‘.
Muhammad Ibn Ishaq added: It occurred in the sixth year but Moosa Ibn
‘Uqbah said that it occurred in the fourth. An-Nu‘man Ibn Rashid related
from Az-Zuhri: The incident of Al-Ifk occurred in the Battle of Muraisi‘.
This is how Al-Bukhari related it from Moosa Ibn Uqbah and that it was
in the fourth year.
Ibn Ishaq said: ‘Asim Ibn ‘Umar Ibn Qatadah, ‘Abdullah Ibn Abu Bakr
and Muhammad Ibn Yahya Ibn Hibbaan all informed me about some of
the incident of Banu Mustaliq. They said: Information reached the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, that Banu
Mustaliq were mobilizing against him and their commander was Harith
Ibn Abu Dirar, Juwairiyah Bint Al-Harith’s father whom Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, married afterwards.
Upon hearing of their mobilization, he went out against them at the site of
one of their water sources called Al-Muraisi‘ in the direction of Qudaid
toward the shore. The two sides clashed and a furious battle ensued. Allah,
the Almighty, vanquished Banu Mustaliq. Some of them were killed and
their children and women were captured and shared as booty of war.
It is recorded in the Saheehhain from the Hadith of ‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Aun
who said: I wrote to Nafi‘ asking him about the supplication before
fighting and he said, ‘The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, raided Banu Mustaliq while they were unaware and
while their animals were being watered. Their fighting men were killed
and their women and children were taken as captives; the Prophet, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, got Juwairiyah, may Allah be pleased
with her, on that day. Nafi‘ said that Ibn ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased
180

In The Defence Of the True Faith
with them both, had told him the above narration and that Ibn ‘Umar, may
Allah be pleased with them both, was in that army.
Ibn Ishaq related: While the people were still by that well, Umar Ibn AlKhattab, may Allah be pleased with him, had an employee from Banu
Ghifar called Jahjah Ibn Mas‘ood whom he hired to tend to his horse.
Jahjah crowded Sinan Ibin Wabar Al-Juhani of Banu Awf Ibn Al-Khazraj
and a scuffle ensued between them. Al-Juhani cried out, ‘O Ansar!’ and
Jahjah also called out, ‘O Muhajiroon!’. ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salool
was infuriated. He had a group of people from his clansmen among whom
was Zaid Ibn Arqam, may Allah be pleased with him, who was a young
boy.
Abdullah Ibn Ubayy said, “Indeed they have not only crowded us here,
but even in our land. The case of our hospitality to them has been nothing
short of (the common saying) ‘Feed your beast and one day it will devour
you’. By Allah, when we return to Madinah, the honorable one will expel
the meaner one.” Then he turned to those who were with him among the
people and said, “This is what you have brought upon yourselves. You
allowed them to occupy your land and you have willingly shared your
wealth. By
Allah, if you would deprive them of these privileges, they will go
somewhere else.”
Zaid Ibn Arqam, may Allah be pleased with him, heard this and took the
information to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him. At the time, he had just completed his military operation against
his enemies. Zaid informed him in the presence of ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab,
may Allah be pleased with him, and he (Umar) said, “Order Abbad Ibn
Bishr to go and execute him.” Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said: “O ‘Umar, how would it then be when people
begin to say that Muhammad has started killing his Companions? No,
rather, make an announcement that we are proceeding immediately.” The
people obediently proceeded at a time which was quite unusual for the
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, to proceed.
When he got wind that Zaid Ibn Arqam, may Allah be pleased with him,
had informed the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, of
181

In The Defence Of the True Faith
what he heard him say, Abdullah Ibn Ubayy Ibn Salool went to the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, swearing
by Allah that he had never said any of what he was told. Because he
enjoyed an exalted status among his people, the Ansar who were with the
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, sympathized with him
saying, “O Messenger of Allah, it may be that the boy imagined what he
said and did not remember the exact words the man uttered.”
When the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was on his
way back, Usaid Ibn Hudair, may Allah be pleased with him, met and
greeted him and said, “O Messenger of Allah, you are moving at a bad
time, you have never done that before.” The Prophet, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, said: “Have you not heard what your companion
has said?” “Which companion?” Usaid asked and the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Abdullah Ibn Ubayy.”
“What did he say?” Usayd asked further to which the Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, answered: “He claims that if he returns to
Madinah, the honorable one will expel the meaner.” Usaid said
reassuringly, “But you, O Messenger of Allah, can expel him if you wish.
By Allah he is the mean one while you are the honorable one.” He added,
‘O Messenger of Allah, be gentle with him for Allah, the Almighty,
brought you to us while his people were about to crown him and he
believes that you have deprived him of a kingdom.”
Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
having the men with him, kept on walking throughout the day till night.
Then throughout the night till next morning, so that the sun oppressed
them. Then he stopped to alight. Once they were on the ground, they fell
sound asleep. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, did this deliberately so as to divert their thoughts from the
incident of Abdullah Ibn Ubayy which had occurred the previous day.
Then the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, proceeded
to a watering place known as AlBaq‘a in Hijaz slightly above An-Naqi‘.
While on their journey, a violent wind blew which terrified them. Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Do not be
terrified by it, it signifies the death of one of the greatest disbelievers.”
When they arrived in Madinah, they discovered that the person who had
182

In The Defence Of the True Faith
died that day was Rifa‘ah Ibn Zaid Ibn At-Taboot, a member of Banu
Qainuqa‘, a great figure among the Jews and a secret haven for the
hypocrites.
Ibn Ishaq related: Among those who were captured as prisoners of war
was Juwairiyah Bint Al-Harith Ibn Abu Dirar. Muhammad Ibn Ja‘afar Ibn
Az-Zubair narrated from Urwah that ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with
her, said, “When Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, distributed the prisoners of Banu Mustaliq, Juwairiyah Bint AlHarith fell to the lot of Thabit Ibn Qais Ibn Shammas or his cousin. She
entered into an agreement to purchase her freedom. She was a very
beautiful woman, most attractive to the eye. No one saw her except that
he was enamored by her (beauty).”
‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said, “She then came to the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, asking
him for the purchase of her freedom. When she was standing at the door,
I looked at her with disapproval. I realized that the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, would look at her in the same
way that I had looked.”
She said, “O Messenger of Allah, I am Juwairiyah, daughter of Al-Harith,
and something has happened to me, which is not hidden from you. I have
fallen to the lot of Thabit Ibn Qais Ibn Shammas or his cousin, and I have
entered into an agreement to purchase my freedom. I have come to you to
seek assistance for the purchase of my freedom.”
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Are you inclined to that which is better?” She asked, “What is that, O
Messenger of Allah?” He replied: “I shall pay the price of your freedom
on your behalf, and I shall marry you.”
She said, “I shall do this.” She (‘A’ishah) said,
“The people then heard that the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, had married Juwairiyah. They released
the captives in their possession and set them free, and said, “They are
the relatives of the Messenger of Allah by marriage.” One hundred
183

In The Defence Of the True Faith
families of Banu Mustaliq were set free on account of her. We did not
see any woman greater than Juwairiyah who brought blessings to her
people.”
Then, Ibn Ishaq mentioned the story of the Ifk in its entirety in this
Ghazwah. This is how Al-Bukhari has also related it.

The Story of the Ifk (Slander)
Ibn Ishaq related that ‘A’ishah, may Allah be pleased with her, said:
Whenever Allah’s Messenger intended to go on a journey, he used to draw
lots amongst his wives. Whomever the lot fell on would travel with him.
When it was the time of the Battle of Banu Mustaliq the lot fell on me so
I proceeded with him.”
She said further: In those days the women would eat lightly, they did not
like meat because they would put on weight. While the camel was being
saddled, I would sit in my Hawdaj. The people would come to carry the
Hawdaj from its lower part, lifting it up and placing it on the back of the
camel where they would fasten it with a rope. They would hold the camel
by the head and then they would proceed.
When the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, had finished
that journey he turned back, and when he was nearing Madinah he halted
and spent part of the night there. Then one of his men announced that they
should be on their way. While they were getting ready, I went out for some
purpose, wearing a necklace of mine around my neck. When I finished, it
slipped from my neck without my knowing, and when I returned to the
camel, I felt my neck for it but could not find it. Meanwhile, the group
had already started off, and I returned to the place where I had been and
looked for it until I found it. The men who had been saddling my camel
for me came, and having already finished the preparation, picked up the
Hawdaj, thinking that I was in it. Then they took the camel by its head and
went off with it. I went back to the camp and not a soul was there, the men
had gone. So I wrapped myself in my gown and lay down in my place. I
knew that if I was missed the men would come back for me.

184

In The Defence Of the True Faith
By Allah, I had barely laid down when Safwan Ibn Al-Mu‘attal AsSulami, who had remained behind from the army for the purpose of
picking up some abandoned properties of the people so that he may return
them to their respective owners, saw me.”
It is also claimed that he was left behind due to his heavy sleeping. This
is corroborated by the Hadith related by Abu Dawood that his wife
complained to the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, about him saying, “O Messenger of Allah, he sleeps beyond
the time of Salat As-Subh, he beats me when I pray and he forces me to
break my fast.” He responded that he was a heavy sleeper, a trait for which
his family was well- known. Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Offer your prayer whenever you
wake up.” He also alleged that his wife would lengthen her prayer (in the
night) elongating her recitation in it and that she used to fast a lot while
he was present (with her).” Thus Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, forbade the woman not to fast while her husband is
present except with his permission. (Hadith)
As-Suhaili said: Safwan, may Allah be pleased with him, was martyred
during the Khilafah of Mu‘awiyah. His leg was amputated (in battle) and
he kept fighting till he was killed, may Allah be pleased with him. He was
buried in Al-Jazeerah at a spot called Shimtat.
It is also possible that he had tarried behind for some of his needs and had
not spent the night with the (other) people. When he saw a black object
perching in the distance, he came toward me. He used to see me before
the veil was prescribed for us, so when he recognized me he exclaimed:
‘Inna lillah wa inna ilayhi raji‘oon’ (To Allah we belong and to Him is
our return.) the wife of Allah’s Messenger?” while I was wrapped in my
garment. He asked, “What has kept you back? May Allah shower His
Mercy on you!” I did not reply. Then he brought his camel over and said,
“Mount” and stood back from me. I mounted and he took the camel by its
head and set off in search of the group. By Allah we did not overtake them
nor was I missed until the morning when they had halted. When they had
rested, the man appeared leading the camel with me riding it. Then the
slanderers said what they said and the camp was disturbed, but, by Allah,
I had no knowledge of that.
185

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Then we arrived in Madinah and shortly afterward I became seriously ill
and so I heard nothing of the matter. However, the talk reached the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and my
parents and they did not mention a thing to me, more or less.
I missed some of the Prophet’s usual kindness to me during this illness
and I disliked that from him. Whenever he came in to see me while my
mother was nursing me, he would say: “How is she?” and would say
nothing more. I found some resentment in my heart so I said to him, “O
Messenger of Allah, will you permit me to go over to my mother?” He
replied: “Alright.”
She continued: So I was taken to my mother’s house still unaware of what
had happened until I recovered from my illness about twenty days later.
We were simple people and we used not to have toilets in our houses like
the foreigners would have. We loathed and detested them. Instead, we
used to go out into the open spaces of Madinah and the women would go
out every night.
One night I went out for my need with Umm Mistah. By Allah she was
walking with me when she tripped over her gown and exclaimed,
“Wretched be Mistah!” I said, “By Allah, it is a bad thing to say of one of
the Muhajireen (Emigrants) who fought at Badr!” Then she said, “Haven’t
you heard the news, daughter of Abu Bakr?” I replied, “What news?” then
she informed me of what the slanderers were spreading. I said, “Did that
really happen?” She said, “Yes, by Allah, it happened!” And by Allah I
was not able to do what I had come to do, so I went back and by Allah, I
did not stop crying until I felt that my heart would break. I said to my
mother, “May Allah forgive you, the people were talking about all this
and you did not mention a word of it to me?” She replied, “My little
daughter, do not be grieved for by Allah, seldom is there a beautiful
woman married to a man who loves her and having co-wives but they
gossip about her and people do the same.”
She added: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, had stood up
and addressed the people while I had no knowledge of it. He praised Allah,
the Almighty, then said: “O people, what is the matter with certain men
that they disturb me about my family and say about them what is not true?
186

In The Defence Of the True Faith
By Allah, I know only good of them, and they say the same about a man
of whom, by Allah I only know good, and who never enters a house of
mine except in my company.”
She continued, “Most of the gossip came from ‘Abdullah Ibn Ubayy of
the Khazraj tribe, besides what Mistah and Hamnah Bint Jahsh said. That
was because her sister Zainab Bint Jahsh was a wife of the Prophet, and
only she among all the wives competed with me for his favor. As for
Zainab, Allah protected her with her religion and she spoke nothing but
good. However, Hamnah gossiped all she could, opposing me for her
sister’s sake.”
When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessing of Allah be upon him,
made his speech, Usaid Ibn Hudair, may Allah be pleased with him, said,
“O Messenger of Allah, if they are from the Aws, let us rid you of them;
and if they are from our Khazraj brothers, then give us your orders, for,
by Allah, they deserve to have their heads cut off.” Sa‘d Ibn ‘Ubadah, may
Allah be pleased with him, got up and before that, he was known to be a
pious man and said, “You have made this statement only because you
know that they are of the Khazraj, and if they had been from your tribe
you would not have said that.”
Usaid said, “It is you who lied, by Allah, you are a hypocrite defending
the hypocrites.”
Emotions ran very high so much so that the two groups almost broke into
a fight. The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, stepped
down from the pulpit and came in to see me. He called ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib
and Usamah Ibin Zaid, may Allah be pleased with them, and asked their
opinion.
Usamah, may Allah be pleased with him, spoke only good, saying, ‘O
Messenger of Allah, they are your family, and this is a lie and falsehood.”
‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, however said, “O Messenger of
Allah, women are plentiful and you are capable of marrying another one
but ask the slave-girl and she will tell you the truth.” The Prophet, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, called Bareerah and questioned her,
and ‘Ali got up and gave her a severe beating, saying, “Tell the Messenger
187

In The Defence Of the True Faith
of Allah the truth!” She replied, “By Allah, I only know good of her, and
I find no fault with ‘A’ishah except that I knead dough and tell her to
watch it, but she falls asleep and the sheep come and eat it!”
Another time, the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, came in to
see me while my parents and another woman from the Ansar were with
me. I was weeping and she too was weeping. He sat down, praised Allah
and then said: “‘A’ishah, you know what people say about you, so fear
Allah, and if you have done wrong as people say, then repent to Allah, for
He accepts repentance from His servants.” And by Allah as he said this
my tears ceased, and I did not feel them anymore. I waited for my parents
to reply on my behalf but they did not speak.”
She said: By Allah, I used to consider myself to be too inconsequential for
Allah, the Almighty, to reveal the Qur’an about me. However, I hoped
that the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, would see
something in his dream by which Allah would clear me of the charge
because He knew my innocence. As for the Qur’an being revealed about
me, by Allah, I felt myself to be too insignificant for that.
When I saw that my parents would not speak, I said to them, “Will you
not reply to the Messenger of Allah?” “By Allah we do not know what to
say to him,” they said. By Allah I do not know of a household which
suffered as the family of Abu Bakr did in those days.
Then she said, “When they kept silent, I burst into tears again, then I said:
‘By Allah, I shall never repent to Allah for what you mention. By Allah,
I know that if I deny what the people say, you would not believe me.'
Then I searched for the name of Ya‘qoob (in my memory) but I could not
remember it, so I said, “I say only what the father of Yoosuf, peace be
upon him, said: ‘So (for me) patience is most fitting. And it is Allah
(Alone) Whose help can be sought against that which you assert.’”
(Soorah Yoosuf:18)
By Allah, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
had not shifted from his sitting position when there came upon him what
used to come upon him. So he was wrapped in his garment and a pillow
188

In The Defence Of the True Faith
was placed under his head. As for me, when I saw that, I was not afraid
nor was I worried for I knew that I was innocent and that Allah, the
Almighty, would not wrong me. As for my parents, by Him in Whose
Hands is ‘A’ishah’s soul, the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, had hardly recovered when I thought that they would die from
fear that confirmation of what the people said would come from Allah,
the Almighty. Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, recovered and sat up, and there rolled down from his face
sweat like pearls on a wintry day.
He sat wiping the perspiration from his face and saying: “Be of good
cheer, ‘A’ishah! Allah has revealed your innocence.” I said, “Praise be to
Allah!” Then he went out to the people and addressed them, reciting to
them the Verses of the Qur’an that were revealed regarding the incident.
Then he ordered that Mistah Ibn Uthathah, Hassan Ibn Thabit and
Hamnah Bint Jahsh be all brought for they were among those who spread
the slander and he carried out on them their prescribed punishment.
This Hadith is also related in the Saheehain through Az-Zuhri. This
sequence has copious benefits. It mentions the prescribed punishment
meted out to Hassan and those with him. Abu Dawood related it in his
Sunan. A Muslim poet said concerning the lashing of Hassan and his
companions:
Hassan did taste what befitted him,
And Hamnah, when they made the evil claim, and Mistah,
They dabbled into accusing the wife of their Prophet,
And they incurred the anger of the Owner of the Noble Throne thus,
They were grieved.
They harmed the Messenger of Allah by (slandering) her,

189

They were draped in encompassing shame that
persisted and they were disgraced, They were made to
taste lashes like showers of rain,
Coming down profusely.

The Ghazwah of Hudaibiyyah
The battle occurred in Dhul-Qa‘dah of the sixth year, by consensus. AlBukhari and Muslim related from Qatadah that Anas Ibn Malik, may
Allah be pleased with him, informed him that Allah’s Messenger, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, performed four ‘Umrahs all of them
in Dhul-Qa‘dah with the exception of the one he performed along with his
Hajj. One ‘Umrah from Hudaibiyyah in the following year and yet another
from Ji‘ranah both of which occurred in Dhul-Qa‘dah. Also in DhulQa‘dah he distributed the booty of the Battle of Hunayn; and then, an
‘Umrah along with his Hajj.” This is AlBukhari’s wording.
Ibn Ishaq related through ‘Urwah Ibn Az-Zubair that Al-Miswar Ibn
Makhramah and Marwan Ibn AlHakam both related that: The Messenger
of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, marched out, in the
year of Al-Hudaibiyyah, with the intention of visiting the House (Ka‘bah)
and did not intend any fighting. He took with him forty camels garlanded
for sacrifice. The people who went with him numbered seven hundred.
One sacrificial camel was meant for every ten person. It has also reached
me that Jabir used to say, “We, the Companions of Hudaibiyah numbered
fourteen hundred.”
Az-Zuhri said: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, marched forth till he got to Usfan where Bishr bin Sufyan AlKa‘bi met him and said, “O Messenger of Allah, the Quraish have become
aware of your movement and they have marched forth even with nursing
camels. They are right now encamped at Dhu Tuwa decked in tiger skin
(traditional war regalia). They have pledged by Allah never to allow you
entrance. Khalid Ibn Al-Waleed is commanding their cavalry and has
gone ahead to set up camp at Kura’al-Gameem, a place situated between
190

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Makkah and Madinah.” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessing of
Allah be upon him, said: “Woe to the Quraish, their hostility is undoing
them. Why do they object to letting me settle this affair with the Arab
tribes without intervention? If the Arab tribes destroy me, that will be a
realization of their objective. If, on the other hand, Allah grants me
victory, then they can enter into Islam with dignity; and if they resist, they
can then fight with good cause. How does the Quraish think? By Allah, I
shall never cease to strive to further the mission for which Allah has sent
me till Allah causes it to prevail or I lose my neck in the process.”
Then the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said, “Is there any man who can direct us to another route different from
the ones the Quraish have occupied?” Ibn Ishaq added, Abdullah Ibn Abu
Bakr narrated to me that a man from Aslam stood and said, “O Messenger
of Allah, I can.” So he took them through a desolate rocky valley route.
By the time they passed through the valley, the journey had been
extremely hard upon the Muslims.
Soon after crossing the hard terrain, they departed and scattered into a
plain land. Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said to the people: “We ask Allah for forgiveness and we repent unto
Him.” After they had done so, he then said: “By Allah, this is the (saying
of) ‘Forgive us’ which was ordained on the children of Isra’eel, but they
did not say it.”
Ibn Shihab related: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, travelled on the way leading to the spot of Thaniyatal-Murar
when his camel suddenly knelt down. The people began to say that it was
stubbornly clinging to the ground. The Prophet, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said: “It is not stubborn as that is not its nature but it
has been restrained by what restrained the elephant from entering
Makkah. Today, the Quraish will not ask me for any anything which is
conducive to strengthening the ties of kinship except that I shall grant
them.
Az-Zuhri narrated in his Hadith: When Allah’s Messenger had settled
down, Budail Ibn Warqa’alKhuza‘i came with some people from his tribe,
Khuza‘a. They conversed with him and asked him for the reason why he
191

In The Defence Of the True Faith
had come. The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, informed them that he did not come to fight, but to visit the House
(of Allah) and venerate its sacredness.
Then they sent Mikraz Ibn Hafs Ibn Al-Akhyaf from Banu Amir Ibn
Lu’ayy. When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, saw him coming, he said: “This is a treacherous man.” When
he approached and spoke to the Prophet, he (the Prophet) responded to
him with the same words as he said to Budail and his Companions.
Then they sent to him Hulais Ibn Alqamah or Ibn Zabban who was at the
time, the chief of the AlAhabeesh from Banu Al-Harith Ibn Abdul Manat
Ibn Kinanah. When Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, saw him coming, he said: “This man is from the tribe that
respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front
of him.” When he saw the sacrificial animals being driven in his presence
through the valley and with knotted ropes already eaten into their skin due
to long tethering at a spot, he returned to the Quraish expressing that he
did not think it is advisable to prevent the Messenger of Allah, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, in deference to what he had seen. They
said to him, “Sit down, you are an ordinary Bedouin possessing no
knowledge.”
Then they sent to the Prophet Urwah Ibn Mas‘ood Ath-Thaqaafee and
when he approached the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, he sat in front of him and then said, “O Muhammad! Won’t you feel
any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone
amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand,
if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not
see (with you) dignified people, but people from various tribes who would
run away leaving you alone.”
Hearing that, Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, who was standing
behind the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, rebuked him and
said, “Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet alone?” Urwah
said, “Who is that man?” They said, “He is Abu Bakr.” Urwah said to Abu
Bakr, “By Him in Whose Hands is my life, were it not for the favor which
you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you.”
192

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Urwah kept on talking to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, and seizing the Prophet’s beard as he was talking while AlMugheerah Ibn Shu‘bah was standing near the head of the Prophet,
holding a sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwah stretched his
hand toward the beard of the Prophet, Al-Mugheerah would hit his hand
with the handle of the sword and say (to Urwah), “Remove your hand
from the beard of Allah’s Messenger.” Urwah raised his head and asked,
“Who is that?” The people said, “He is Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah.”
Urwah said, “O treacherous one! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil
consequences of your treachery of yesterday?”
When he went back to the Quraish, he said, “O Quraish, I have visited
Kisra in his sovereignty and I have equally visited Caesar and Negus in
their respective sovereignties but by Allah, I have never witnessed a king
among his subjects similar to Muhammad amongst his Companions. I
have seen people who would never give him up for anything, so you may
consider your opinion.”
Ibn Ishaq related: I have been informed from ‘Ikrimah from Ibn ‘Abbas,
may Allah be pleased with them both, that Quraish sent forty or fifty men
from them ordering them to reconnoiter the army of Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and to kidnap one of his
Companions. The Quraish contingent were captured and brought to the
Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, but he
forgave and released them even though they had pelted the army of
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, with stones
and arrows.
Afterward, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, summoned ‘Umar Ibn AlKhattab to convey his message to the chiefs
of Makkah explaining the reason for his coming. Umar said, “O
Messenger of Allah, I fear that they would kill me especially since there
is none of the Banu Adiyy in Makkah who could defend me and the
Quraish are well acquainted with my animosity and harshness towards
them, rather I recommend to you a man who is far more respectable to
them than me – ‘Uthman Ibn ‘Affan.”

193

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Thus, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
summoned ‘Uthman Ibn ‘Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, and sent
him to Abu Sufyan and other notables of Quraish informing them that he
had not come to fight (against them) but to visit the House in honor of its
sacredness. Soon after, information reached the Prophet, peace and
blessing of Allah be upon him, and the Muslims that ‘Uthman, may Allah
be pleased with him, had been killed. The Prophet, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said: “We shall not depart until we have fought against
the people (of Quraish).” Then he invited (the Muslims) to give their
pledge. This turned out to be the Pledge of Ridhwaan which took place
under the tree.
Ibn Hisham related: Someone whose trustworthiness I trust informed me
that he was informed through Ibn Abi Mulaikah from Ibn ‘Umar, may
Allah be pleased with them both, that Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, gave a pledge on behalf of ‘Uthman, may
Allah be pleased with him, by placing his hand over the other. The chain
of this Hadith as related by Ibn Hisham is weak however it is confirmed
in the Saheehhain.
Afterward, the Quraish sent Suhail Ibn ‘Amr. When the Messenger of
Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, saw him coming, he
said: “They have decided to negotiate peace with the sending of this man.”
When Suhail finally got to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, they both spoke at length and bantered words and
finally struck a peace agreement. Afterward, the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, requested ‘Ali Ibn Abi Talib,
may Allah be pleased with him, to record the terms of the treaty. “Write
In the Name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful,” The Prophet, peace
and blessing of Allah be upon him, began to dictate to ‘Ali but Suhail
interjected, “I don’t know that, rather, write ‘In Your Name, O God.’ It
was written as Suhail demanded and then the Prophet, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, resumed dictating to ‘Ali: “Write: ‘This is a peace
treaty agreed upon by Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah and Suhail Ibn
Amr.” Again, Suhail interjected, “Had I acknowledged that you are indeed
a Messenger of Allah, I would not have fought you. Rather, write ‘What
is agreed upon by Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdullah and Suhail Ibn Amr.’”
194

In The Defence Of the True Faith
The terms of the treaty stipulated that all hostilities shall be eschewed for
ten years within which people would taste security and each side would
abstain from (fighting) the other; whoever defects from the Quraish to
Muhammad without the permission of his Waliyy, then he shall be
repatriated to them but whoever defects to the Quraish from the camp of
Muhammad shall not be repatriated to him. There shall neither be theft
nor treachery. He who wishes to enter into a covenant and pact with
Muhammad shall be covered and whoever wishes to enter into a covenant
and pact with the Quraish shall be covered as well.
The Khuza‘ah chose to enter into agreement with Muhammad while the
Banu Bakr entered into a pact and covenant with the Quraish. The terms
of the treaty also included: “…And that you shall turn back away without
entering Makkah (against our wish) this year. Next year, however, we
shall leave it for you and your Companions for three days carrying nothing
but riders’ dagger and sheathed sword.”
While the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
was in the process of concluding this treaty, Abu Jandal Ibn Suhail Ibn
‘Amr appeared in fetters, he had escaped to the Prophet from
incarceration. Meanwhile, the Companions of the Prophet had left home
having no doubt of the Conquest (of Makkah) based on the vision that
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, had earlier
seen.
However, when they saw the turn of events and them leaving [without
making hajj] as part of the terms of the peace agreement, which was being
foisted on them, and what the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, had to endure, they became extremely depressed
almost to the point of death. When Suhail saw Abu Jandal, he got up and
hit him in the face and held him by the collar and said: “O Muhammad,
the pact had been concluded before this man came to you.” He (the
Prophet) said: “You are correct.” Then he kept pulling the man violently
by his collar with the intent of taking him back to the Quraish. Abu Jandal
kept crying at the top of his voice, “O Muslims, I am to be sent back to
the disbelievers to coerce me from my religion?”

195

In The Defence Of the True Faith
This exacerbated the grief felt by the Muslims. The Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Abu Jandal, be patient
in expectation of the reward; Allah will forge relief and a way out for you
and other oppressed persons with you. We have entered a pact of peace
with these people and we have given them our word and they have given
us theirs by Allah and we do not want to betray them.
When the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
rose from the peace treaty, he went to his sacrificial animal and
slaughtered it and then had his head shaven. The one who shaved his head
that day was Khirash Ibn Umayyah Ibn Al-Fadl Al-Khuza‘i. When the
Muslims saw that the Messenger had slaughtered and shaven his head,
they rushed to do so as well.
Ibn Ishaq related from Ibn ‘Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that,
some men shaved their head while others merely trimmed it. So Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “May Allah
have mercy on those who shaved.” People interjected: “And those who
trimmed, O Messenger of Allah?” “May Allah have mercy on those who
shaved,” Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
repeated. Still the people interjected, “And those who trimmed, O
Messenger of Allah?” Then the Messenger said, “…And those who
trimmed.” The people asked, “O Messenger of Allah, why did you give
preference to those who shaved asking mercy for them to the preclusion
of those who trimmed?” The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, responded: “(Because) they did not doubt.”
Al-Bukhari related from Zaid Ibn Khalid who said, “We went out with
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, in the Year
of Al-Hudaibiyyah. One night, it rained and Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, led us in the Fajr Prayer and (after
finishing it), turned to us and said: “Do you know what your Lord has
said?” We replied, “Allah and His Messenger know it better.” He said:
“Allah says: (Some of) My slaves got up believing in Me, And (some of
them) disbelieving in Me. The one who said: We have been given rain
through Allah’s Mercy and Allah’s Blessing and Allah’s Bounty, then he
is a believer in Me, and is a disbeliever in the star. And whoever said: We
196

In The Defence Of the True Faith
have been given rain because of such and such star, then he is a believer
in the star, and is a disbeliever in Me.
Al-Bukhari also related from Al-Bara’ (Ibn ‘Azib) who said, “Do you
(people) consider the conquest of Makkah the victory? Was the conquest
of Makkah a victory? We really consider that the actual Victory was the
Ar-Ridhwaan Pledge of allegiance which we gave on the day of AlHudaibiyyah (to the Prophet). On the day of Al-Hudaibiyyah we were
fourteen hundred men along with the Prophet, peace and blessings be
upon him. Al-Hudaibiyyah was a well, the water of which we used up and
did not leave a single drop of water remaining. When the Prophet, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, was informed of that, he came and
sat on its edge. Then he asked for a utensil of water, performed ablution
from it, rinsed (his mouth), supplicated (to Allah, the Almighty), and
poured the remaining water into the well. We stayed there for a while and
then the well filled with water for ourselves and our riding animals.” The
Hadith is exclusively related by Al-Bukhari.
Az-Zuhri said, “No previous victory was greater than this. It was only
fighting when people met; however, when there was an armistice instead
of war, people felt secure, sat together and negotiated to settle disputes.
No one rationalized what was said about Islam except that he embraced
it. In those two years, so many people embraced Islam as never before or
even more. Ibn Hisham said: The proof of what Az-Zuhri said is that
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, marched
out to Hudaibiyyah with one thousand four hundred men according to
Jabir’s report but he marched out two years afterward, for the conquest of
Makkah, with ten thousand men.
Al-Bukhari related from Jabir who said: “On the day of Al-Hudaibiyyah,
the people felt thirsty and Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, had a utensil containing water. He performed ablution from
it and then the people came toward him. Allah’s Messenger said: ‘What
is wrong with you?’ The people said, ‘O Allah’s Messenger! We haven’t
got any water to perform ablution with or to drink, except what you have
in your utensil.’ So the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
put his hand in the utensil and the water started gushing out between his
fingers like springs. So we drank and performed ablution.” I said to Jabir,
197

In The Defence Of the True Faith
“What was your number on that day?” He replied, “Even if we had been
one hundred thousand, that water would have been sufficient for us.
Anyhow, we were 1,500.”
Al-Bukhari also related that Qatadah said to Sa‘eed Ibn Al-Musayyab: It
(information) has reached me that Jabir said they were fourteen hundred
men. Sa‘eed then responded: Jabir narrated to me that there were fifteen
hundred men who pledged allegiance to the Prophet, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, on the day of Al-Hudaibiyyah.
Al-Bukhari related from ‘Amr who heard Jabir say, “On the day of AlHudaibiyyah, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said to us: 'You are the best people on the earth!' We were 1,400 then.
If I could see now, I would have shown you the place of the Tree
(underneath which we gave the Pledge of allegiance).”
Al-Bukhari related from Abdullah Ibn Abu Awfa said, “The people (who
gave the Pledge of allegiance) under the Tree numbered 1300 and the
number of Banu Aslam was one-eighth of the Emigrants.”
Then Al-Bukhari related from Marwan and Al-Miswar Ibn Makhramah
both of whom said: “In the year of Al-Hudaibiyyah, the Prophet, peace
and blessings be upon him, went out with around ten thousand of his
Companions. When they got to Dhul Hulayfah, he garlanded and marked
his Hady and assumed his Ihram from there.”
All of these narrations contradict the view of Ibn Ishaq that the
Companions of Al-Hudaibiyyah numbered seven hundred. And Allah
knows best. He merely said that spontaneously from his own conjecture,
owing to the fact that the number of the sacrificial camels on that day was
seventy, each one meant for ten people. Based on his opinion, the people
who made the sacrifice would then be seven hundred. On the contrary,
however, it is neither automatic that all of them slaughtered nor that all of
them assumed Ihram. It is confirmed that Allah’s Messenger, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, sent some of them who did not assume
Ihram, among whom was Abu Qatadah, may Allah be pleased with him.
Abu Qatadah, may Allah be pleased with him, did not assume Ihram
which was why he was able to kill the wild donkey from which he and his
198

In The Defence Of the True Faith
companions ate and some of which they took to the Messenger of Allah,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, midway through their journey.
The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said:
“Did anyone of you order him to attack it (the animal) or pointed it out to
him?” They responded, “No.” He said: “You may eat the remainder of its
meat.”
Al-Bukhari related from ‘Abdullah Ibn Abi Qatadah that his father related
to him saying, “We set out with the Prophet in the year of Al-Hudaibiyah,
and all his companions assumed Ihram but I did not.”
Al-Bukhari related from Qatadah (who narrated) from Sa‘eed Ibn AlMusayyab (who in turn narrated) from his father who said, “I had seen the
tree (under which the pledge was made) and I came to it but afterwards I
did not recognize it anymore.”
Al-Bukhari also related through Tariq Ibn ‘Abdur-Rahmaan who said,
“When I set out for Hajj, I passed by some people offering a prayer, I
asked, “What is this mosque?” They said, “This is the Tree where Allah’s
Messenger took the Ar-Ridhwaan Pledge of allegiance. Then I went to
Sa‘eed Ibn Al-Musayyab and informed him about it. Sa‘eed said, “My
father said that he was amongst those who had given the Pledge of
Allegiance to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, beneath the Tree.
He (i.e., my father) said, When we set out the following year, we forgot
the Tree and were unable to recognize it.” Then Sa‘eed said (perhaps
sarcastically), “The Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be
upon him, could not recognize it; nevertheless, you (claim to) recognize
it; do you then possess better knowledge (than them)?”
Al-Bukhari related from Abbad Ibn Tameem who said, “When it was the
day (of the Battle) of Al-Harra the people were giving Pledge of
Allegiance to ‘Abdullah Ibn Hanzalah. Ibn Zaid said, “For what are the
people giving Pledge of allegiance to ‘Abdullah Ibn Hanzalah?” It was
said to him, “For death.” Ibn Zaid said, “I will never give the Pledge of
Allegiance for that to anybody else after Allah’s Messenger, peace and
199

In The Defence Of the True Faith
blessings be upon him.” Ibn Zaid was one of those who had witnessed the
day of Al-Hudaibiyyah with the Prophet.”

Al-Bukhari’s Narration of the ‘Umrah of AlHudaibiyyah
Al-Miswar Ibn Al-Makhramah and Marwan (whose narrations
corroborate each other) said: Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, set out at the time of Al-Hudaibiyyah (treaty), and
when they proceeded for a distance, he said, “Khalid Ibn Al-Waleed is
leading the cavalry of Quraish and is at a place called Al-Ghameem, so
take the way to the right.” By Allah, Khalid did not perceive the arrival of
the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army
reached him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform the Quraish.
The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, went on
advancing till he reached Thaniyyah (i.e., a mountainous way) through
which one would go to them (i.e., people of Quraish). The she-camel of
the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, sat down. The people tried
their best to cause the shecamel to get up but in vain, so they said, “AlQaswa’ (i.e. the she-camel’s name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa’ has
become stubborn!” The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, said: “AlQaswa’ has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not
her habit, but she was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant.” Then
he said: “By the Name of Him in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e.,
the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will respect the ordinances
of Allah, I will grant it to them.”
The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, then rebuked the
she-camel and she got up. The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, changed his way till he dismounted at the farthest end of AlHudaibiyyah at a pit (i.e., well) containing a little water which the people
used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all its water
and complained to Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, of thirst. The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, took an arrow out of his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow
in that pit. By Allah, the water started and continued gushing out till all
the people quenched their thirst and returned with satisfaction.
200

In The Defence Of the True Faith
While they were still in that state, Budail Ibn Warqa’-Al-Khuza‘i came
with some people from his tribe Khuza‘ah and they were the advisers of
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, who would
keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihamah. Budail
said, “I left Ka‘b Ibn Lu’ayy and ‘Amir Ibn Lu’ayy residing at the profuse
water of Al-Hudaibiyyah and they had milch camels (or their women and
children) with them, and will wage war against you, and will prevent you
from visiting the Ka‘bah.” Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings be
upon him, said: “We have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the
‘Umrah. No doubt, the war has weakened Quraish and they have suffered
great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with them, during
which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people
(i.e., the Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those
infidels, Quraish will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people
do, if they wish; they will at least get strong enough to fight. But if they
do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose Hands my life is, I will fight
with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but (I am sure) Allah will
definitely make His Cause victorious.”
Budail said, “I will inform them of what you have said.” So, he set off till
he reached the Quraish and said, “We have come from that man (i.e.,
Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we will disclose to
you if you should like.” Some of the fools among the Quraish shouted that
they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said,
“Relate what you heard him saying.” Budail said, “I heard him saying soand-so,” relating what the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, had told him.
‘Urwah Ibn Mas‘ood got up and said, “O people! Are you not the sons?
They said, “Yes.” He added, “Am I not the father?” They said, “Yes.” He
said, “Do you mistrust me?” They said, “No.” He said, “Do you not know
that I invited the people of ‘Ukadh for your help, and when they refused I
brought my relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help
you)?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “This man (i.e., the Prophet) has offered
you a reasonable proposal, you had better accept it and allow me to meet
him.” They said, “You may meet him.” So, he went to the Prophet, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, and started talking to him. The
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, told him almost the
201

In The Defence Of the True Faith
same thing as he had told Budail. Then ‘Urwah said, “O Muhammad!
Won’t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever
heard of anyone amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you?
On the other hand, if the reverse should happen, (nobody will aid you, for)
by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified people, but people from various
tribes who would run away leaving you alone.”
Hearing that, Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, abused him and
said, “Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet, peace and
blessings be upon him, alone?” ‘Urwah said, “Who is that man?” They
said, “He is Abu Bakr.” ‘Urwah said to Abu Bakr, “By Him in Whose
Hands my life is, were it not for the favor which you did to me and which
I did not compensate, I would retort at you.” ‘Urwah kept on talking to
the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, and seizing the Prophet’s
beard as he was talking while Al-Mugheerah Ibn Shu‘bah was standing
near the head of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, holding a
sword and wearing a helmet. Whenever ‘Urwah stretched his hand toward
the beard of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, Al-Mugheerah
would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to ‘Urwah),
“Remove your hand from the beard of Allah’s Messenger.” ‘Urwah raised
his head and asked, “Who is that?” The people said, “He is Al-Mugheerah
Ibn Shu‘bah.” ‘Urwah said, “O treacherous one! Am I not doing my best
to prevent evil consequences of your treachery?”
Before embracing Islam, Al-Mugheerah was in the company of some
people. He killed them and took their property and came (to Madinah) to
embrace Islam. The Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said to him: “As regards your Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I
do not take anything of it.” (As it was taken through treason).” ‘Urwah
then started looking at the Companions of the Prophet. By Allah,
whenever Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
spat, the spittle would fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet’s
Companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he ordered them
they would carry out his orders immediately; if he performed ablution,
they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to
him, they would lower their voices and would not look at his face
constantly out of respect. ‘Urwah returned to his people and said, “O
people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Qaisar, Kisra and
202

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as
much as Muhammad is respected by his Companions. By Allah, if he
spits, the spittle falls in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet’s
Companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if he orders them,
they carry out his order immediately; if he performs ablution, they
struggle to take the remaining water; and when they speak, they lower
their voices and do not look at his face constantly out of respect.” ‘Urwah
added, “No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable offer, so
please accept
it.”
A man from the tribe of Banu Kinanah said, “Allow me to go to him,” and
they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet, peace and
blessings be upon him, and his companions, Allah’s Messenger said: “He
is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that respects the Budn (i.e. camels
of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of him.” So, the Budn were
brought before him and the people received him while they were reciting
Talbiyah. When he saw that scene, he said, “Glorified be Allah! It is not
fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka‘bah.” When he returned
to his people, he said, ‘I saw the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted
ropes) and marked (with stabs on their backs). I do not think it is advisable
to prevent them from visiting the Ka‘bah.” Another person called Mikraz
Ibn Hafs got up and sought their permission to go to Muhammad, and they
allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Here is Mikraz and he is a
vicious man.” Mikraz started talking to the Prophet, peace and blessings
of Allah be upon him, and as he was talking, Suhail Ibn ‘Amr came.
Ma‘mar related: Ayyoob related to me on the authority of ‘Ikrimah that
when Suhail Ibn ‘Amr came, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, said: “Your affair has become easy.” Ma‘mar added:
Az-Zuhri related in his own narration: Suhail said, “Please conclude a
peace treaty with us.” So, the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, called the scribe and said to him: “Write: In the Name of Allah,
the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.” Suhail said, “As for
‘Beneficent,’ by Allah, I do not know what it means. So write: ‘In Your
Name O Allah’, as you used to write previously.” The Muslims said, “By
Allah, we will not write except: By the Name of Allah, the most
203

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Beneficent, the most Merciful.” The Prophet, peace and blessing of Allah
be upon him, said: “Write: In Your Name O Allah.” Then he dictated:
“This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, Allah’s Messenger has
concluded.” Suhail said, “By Allah, if we knew that you were Allah’s
Messenger we would not prevent you from visiting the Ka‘bah, and would
not fight with you. So, write: “Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdullah.” The Prophet,
peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, said: “By Allah! I am Messenger
of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad Ibn
‘Abdullah.”
It is recorded in the Saheeh that ‘Ali, may Allah be pleased with him,
objected saying, “By Allah I will not erase you.” Then he took over the
writing and wrote: “This is the peace treaty which Muhammad Ibn
‘Abdullah has concluded.” Many people have spoken at length on this
issue and we mentioned it in brief in the explanation of the statement of
Allah: Neither did you (O Muhammad) read any book before it (this
Qur'an), nor did you write any book (whatsoever) with your right hand. In
that case, indeed, the followers of falsehood might have doubted.
In some versions, the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
said: “Whoever defects from us will be distanced by Allah (from His
mercy).”
Az-Zuhri said, “The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, accepted
all those terms, as he had already said that he would accept everything
they would demand if it respected the ordinance of Allah, the Almighty,
(i.e., by letting him and his companions perform ‘Umrah.)” The Prophet,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to Suhail: “On the
condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka‘bah) so that we may
perform Tawaf around it.” Suhail said, “By Allah, we will not (allow you
this year) so as not to give chance to the Arabs to say that we have yielded
to you, but we will allow you next year.” So, the Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, got that written.
Then Suhail said, “We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever
comes to you from us, even if he has embraced your religion.” The
Muslims said, “Glorified be Allah! How will such a person be returned to
the pagans after he has become a Muslim?” While they were in this state
204

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Abu Jandal Ibn Suhail bin ‘Amr came from the valley of Makkah
staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail
said, “O Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make
peace with you, i.e., you shall return Abu Jandal to me.” The Prophet,
peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, said: “The peace treaty has not
been written yet.” Suhail said, “I will never allow you to keep him.” The
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: “Yes.” He said,
“I will not.” The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said: “We
allow you (to keep him).” Abu Jandal said, “O Muslims! Will I be returned
to the pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don’t you see how much
I have suffered?” Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the cause of
Allah, the Almighty.
Az-Zuhri added: ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab said, “I went to the Prophet and
said, ‘Are you not truly the Messenger of Allah?’ The Prophet, peace and
blessing of Allah be upon him, said: ‘Yes, indeed.’ I said, ‘Is not our cause
just and the cause of the enemy unjust?’ He said: ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘Then why
should we be humiliated in our religion?’ He said: “I am Allah’s
Messenger and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious.” I
said, ‘Did you not tell us that we would go to the Ka‘bah and perform
Tawaf around it?’ He said: “Yes, but did I tell you that we would visit the
Ka‘bah this year?” I said, ‘No.’ He said: “So you will visit it and perform
Tawaf around it.”
“Umar further said, “I went to Abu Bakr and said, ‘O Abu Bakr! Is he not
truly Allah’s Prophet?’ He replied, ‘Yes.’ I said, ‘Then why should we be
humble in our religion?’ He said, ‘Indeed, he is Allah’s Messenger and he
does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to
him as, by Allah, he is on the right.’ I said, ‘Was he not telling us that we
would go to the Ka‘bah and perform Tawaf around it?’ He said, ‘Yes, but
did he tell you that you would go to the Ka‘bah this year?’ I said, ‘No.’
He said, ‘You will go to the Ka‘bah and perform Tawaf around it.’” (AzZuhri added, ‘Umar said, “I performed many good deeds as expiation for
the improper questions I asked them.”)
When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah’s Messenger,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said to his companions, “Get
up and slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved.” By Allah none
205

In The Defence Of the True Faith
of them got up, and the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, repeated his order thrice. When none of them got up, he left them
and went to Umm Salamah, may Allah be pleased with her, and told her
of the people’s attitude toward him. Umm Salamah, may Allah be pleased
with her, said, “O Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried
out? Go out and do not say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered
your sacrifice and call your barber to shave your head.” So, the Prophet,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, went out and did not talk to
anyone of them till he did that, i.e., slaughtered the sacrifice and called his
barber who shaved his head. Seeing that, the Companions of the Prophet,
peace and blessings be upon him, got up, slaughtered their sacrifices, and
started shaving the heads of one another.
Afterwards, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, returned to Madinah then Abu Baseer, a new Muslim convert from
Quraish came to him (Ibn Ishaq said: al-Azhar bin Abd Awf az-Zuhri and
al-Akhnas bin Shuraiq ath-Thaqafi sent a man from Banu Amir bin
Lu’ayy along with a freed slave of theirs to seek Abu Baseer’s
repatriation. He also mentioned that the one whom Abu Baseer killed was
the man from Banu al-Amir and the one who escaped was the freed slave).
The infidels sent in his pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet), “Abide
by the promise you gave us.” So, the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, handed him over to them. They took him out (of the city) till
they reached Dhul-Hulaifah where they dismounted to eat some dates they
had with them. Abu Baseer said to one of them, “By Allah, O so-and-so,
I see you have a fine sword.” The other drew it out (of the scabbard) and
said, “By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried it many times.” Abu Baseer
said, “Let me have a look at it.”
When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his
companion ran away till he came to Madinah and entered the Mosque
running. When Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon
him, saw him he said: “This man appears to have been frightened.” When
he reached the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, he said,
“My companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too.”
Abu Baseer came and said, “O Allah’s Messenger, by Allah, Allah has
made you fulfill your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the
206

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Infidels), but Allah, the Almighty, has saved me from them.” The Prophet,
peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, said: (Woe to his mother! What
an excellent war kindler he would be, should he only have supporters!)
When Abu Baseer heard that he understood that the Prophet, peace and
blessings of Allah be upon him, would return him to them again, so he set
off till he reached the seashore. Abu Jandal Ibn Suhail managed to escape
from captivity (i.e. of the infidels) and joined Abu Baseer. So, whenever
a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Baseer till they
formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of
Quraish heading toward Sham, they stopped it, attacked and killed them
(i.e., infidels) and took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a
message to the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him,
requesting him for the sake of Allah, kith and kin to send for Abu Baseer
and his companions promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the
Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, would be secure. So
the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, sent for them (i.e.
Abu Baseer’s companions) and Allah revealed the following Verses:
And it is He Who has withheld their hands from you and your hands from
them in the midst of Makkah, after He made you the victorious over
them... the pride and haughtiness of the time of ignorance.” (Soorah AlFat‘h 48:24-26)
And their pride and haughtiness was such that they did not confess (write
in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and
refused to write: “In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most
Merciful,” and prevented the Muslims from visiting the Ka‘bah. This
version includes some beneficial additions that are not present in the
version of Ibn Ishaq from Az-Zuhri.
Al-Bukhari related from Zaid Ibn Aslam who narrated from his father that
while Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, was
proceeding at night during one of his journeys and ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab,
may Allah be pleased with him, was traveling beside him, ‘Umar, may
Allah be pleased with him, asked him about something but Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, did not reply. He
asked again, but he did not reply, and then he asked (for the third time)
207

In The Defence Of the True Faith
but he did not reply. On that, ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattab, may Allah be pleased
with him, said to himself, “Thakilatka Ummuka ya Umar (May ‘Umar’s
mother lose her son)! I asked Allah’s Messenger three times but he did
not reply.” ‘Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, then said, “I made my
camel run faster and went ahead of the people, and I was afraid that some
Qur’anic Verses might be revealed concerning me. Not long afterwards, I
heard somebody calling me. I said to myself, ‘I fear that some Qur’anic
Verses have been revealed concerning me,’ and so I went to Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessing of Allah be upon him, and greeted him. He
said: “Tonight a Soorah (Chapter) has been revealed to me, and it is dearer
to me than that on which the sun rises (i.e. the world)” Then he recited:
“Verily, We have given you a manifest victory.” (Soorah Al-Fat‘h 48:1)

Military Expeditions and Invasions that Occurred in
the Sixth Year of Hijrah
The summary of that is cited by Al-Hafiz Al-Baihaqi from Al-Waqidi. He
said: In Rabee‘ ul-Awwal or Rabee‘ ul-Akhir of that year, Allah’s
Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, sent Ukkashah Ibn
Mihsan at the head of forty men to Al-Ghamr, among whom were Thabit
Ibn Aqram and Siba‘ Ibn Wahb both of whom were too hasty thus their
action warned the enemy and they fled.
The same year, Abu ‘Ubaidah Ibn al-Jarrah, may Allah be pleased with
him, was sent with forty men to Al-Qassah. They advanced toward the
enemy on foot till got to them in the early morning and then fled into the
mountain tops. Also, Muhammad Ibn Maslamah was sent among a
contingent of ten men. The enemy hid for them till they were asleep,
unaware of the lurking danger. The companions of Muhammad Ibn
Maslamah were all killed but he escaped with injuries.
Occurring in the same year was the military expedition of Zaid Ibn
Harithah at Al-Hamoom where he captured an adorned lady called
Haleemah. She directed the Muslims to one of the quarters of Banu Sulaim
where they obtained fortune and captives. Among the captives was this
lady’s husband. As a reward, Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, gave her back to her husband and manumitted both of
them.
208

In The Defence Of the True Faith
Again, Zaid Ibn Harithah was sent to Banu Tha‘labah in the Jumadal-Oola
of the same year with a detachment of fifteen men. The Arab tribes fled
from him. It is also said that the merchandise in the custody of Abu Al‘As Ibn Ar-Rabee‘ was seized this year he sought the protection of Zainab,
may Allah be pleased with her, the daughter of Allah’s Messenger and it
was granted.
In Sha‘ban of the sixth year, the detachment commanded by AbdurRahman Ibn ‘Awf, may Allah be pleased with him, was sent to Daumat
ul-Jandal. Before he left, the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of
Allah be upon him, instructed him: “If they obey you, marry the daughter
of their king.” The people accepted Islam and following the Prophet’s
recommendation, Abdur-Rahman, may Allah be pleased with him,
married Tumadir Ibn Al-Asbagh Al-Kalbiyah, the daughter of their king,
who gave birth to Abu Salamah Ibn Abdur-Rahmaan bin Awf.
Shawwal of the sixth year also witnessed the expedition of Kurz Ibn Jabir
Al-Fihri against the people of ‘Urainah who murdered the shepherd of
Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and herded
away the livestock. Allah’s Messenger, peace and blessings of Allah be
upon him, sent on their trail Kurz Ibn Jabir at the command of twenty
horsemen who succeeded in repulsing them and returned the stolen
livestock.
From their story is what is related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim: Anas, may
Allah be pleased with him, said, “Some people of ‘Ukl or ‘Urainah tribe
came to Madinah and its climate did not suit them. So the Prophet, peace
and blessings of Allah be upon him, ordered them to go to the herd of
(milch) camels and to drink their milk and urine (as a medicine). So they
went as directed and after they became healthy, they killed the shepherd
of the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and drove away
all the camels. The news reached the Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah
be upon him, early in the morning and he sent (men) in their pursuit and
they were captured and brought at noon. He then ordered to cut their hands
and feet (and it was done), and their eyes were branded with heated pieces
of iron. They were abandoned in the direction of ‘Al-Harrah’ till they died
in that condition.”

Summary of Events and Occurrences of the Sixth
Year of Hijrah
The obligation of Hajj was promulgated this year as repeatedly pointed
out by Ash-Shafi‘i, may Allah have Mercy on him, while commenting on
the statement of Allah, the Almighty: And perform properly (i.e. all the
ceremonies according to the ways of Prophet Muhammad), the Hajj and
‘Umrah (i.e. the pilgrimage to Makkah) for Allah. (Soorah Al-Baqarah
2:196).
Consequently, he is of the opinion that Hajj should be performed at a later
time. This is because he (the Prophet) did not perform Hajj until the tenth
year. However, Ash-Shafi‘i, may Allah have Mercy upon him, is
contradicted by the other three Imams – Malik, Abu Hanifah and Ahmad,
may Allah have Mercy upon them. According to them, Hajj is obligatory
earnestly upon anyone who is able to undertake it.
