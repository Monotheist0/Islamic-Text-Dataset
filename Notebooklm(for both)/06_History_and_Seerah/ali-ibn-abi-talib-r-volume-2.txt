About the word 'Lord'

%e word lord in English bas several related meanings. The
original meaning is 'master' or 'ruler', and in this sense it is often
used to refer to human beings: 'the lord of the mansion' or 'Lord Soand-So' (in the United Kingdom, for example). The word Lord with a
capital L is used in the lexicon of Islam to refer to the One and Only
God-Allah. In Islam, there is no ambiguity about the meaning of this
word. While it is true that one may occasionally use the word lord
(whether capitalized or not) to refer to a human being, in Islamic
discourse the reference of this term is always clear from the context.
Whereas for Christians, Hindus and other polytheists, the word Lord
with a capital L may refer to Allah, to Jesus or to some imagined
deity, for Muslims, there can be no plurality of meaning. AUah alone
is the Lord, and the Lord is AUah - not Jesus, not Rama, not any
other being.

CHAPTER SIX

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen,
and the Issue of Arbitration
cAllah

(s)
says:

4If two parties among the Believers fall into a quarrel, make ye peace
between them: but if one of them transgresses beyond bounds against
the other, then fight ye [all] againstthe one that transgresses until it
complies with the command of Allah, but if it complies, then rnake
peace between them with justice, and be fair: for AUah loves those
who are fair [and just]. The Believers are but a single Brotherhood:
So make peace and reconciliation between your two [contending]
brothers: And fear Allah that ye may receive Mercy.)
(Qur'an 49: 9-10)
It was narrated that Anas ibn M2ik (&>) said: "It was said to
the Prophet (g):
'Why don't you go to Abdullah ibn Ubayy (to
persuade him to accept Islam)?' So he went to him, riding a donkey,
and the Muslims set out too, and (they passed over) saline ground.
When the Prophet (g)
came to him, he said: 'Do not come near me,
for by Allah the stench of your donkey offends me.' One of the An&
said: 'By Allah (%), the donkey of the Messenger of AUah (g,)
smells better than yon do.' One of Abdullab's people got angry on his
behalf, then the two groups got angry with one another and hit each
another with palm branches, hands and shoes. We heard that the
following words were revealed concerning them: 41f two parties
among the Believers fall into a quarrel, make ye peace between
them.$. (Qur'an 49: 9)"'

20

The Battles of the Camel andSijjeen, and the issue of arbitration

It was narrated from al-Hasan, from 'Ali ibn Abi Talhah, from
Ibn 'Abba's concerning that verse, (If two paties among the
Believers fall into a quarrel, make ye peace between them: but if one
of them transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then fight ye
[all] against the one that msgresses until it complies with the
command of ~ i i a h , )(Qur'an 49: 9) that AUah (%) commanded the
Prophet (g)
and the believers that if two groups among the believers
fight, they should call them to the ruling of Allah and reach a fair deal
between them. If they respond, then they should be judged in
accordance with the Book of Allah, so that the group that was
wronged may settle scores with the group that wronged them. If they
refuse to comply, then they have committed a transgression, and it is
the duty of the leader of the believers to fight them until they comply
with the command of Allah and accept His ruling.2
The words of Allah (&),BIf two parties among the Believers
fall into a quarrel, make ye peace between them) mean that the
people in authority must t ~ yto reconcile between them by advising
them and calling them to the rule of AUah
discussing with them
and trying to remove any misunderstanding and causes of dispute.
The word 'if serves to point out that it is not proper for fighting to
take place between the Muslims; if it happens, it is something very
rare. This verse is addressed to the people in authority, and the order
is binding.3 (Bukhari and others quoted this verse as evidence that no
matter how great a sin may be, it does not put one beyond the pale of
slam;^ this is contrary to the opinion of the Kharijites, who said that
the one who commits a major sin is a disbeliever who will be in hell.)
It is recorded in Saheeh al-Bukhari that Abu ~ a k r a h '(&) said: "The
Messenger of Allah (g)gave a speech one day, and with him on the
minbar was al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (&). The Prophet (g)
started looking
from him to the people, and he said: 'This son of mine is a leader, and
perhaps Allah will reconcile two great groups of the Muslims through

(s),

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

21

him."'6 It occurred as he said; through him, Allah ($)brought about
reconciliation between the people of Syria and the people of Iraq,
after the battles that took place between them.7
The words of Allah (%): G u t if one of them transgresses
beyond bounds against the other, then fight ye [all] against the one
that transgresses until it complies with the command of Allah), mean
that if one of the two groups transgressed and violated the rights of
the other, and then they do not pay attention to the rulings of Allah or
to advice, then the Muslims have to tight them until they come back
to the ruling of Allah (%). The instruction in this verse of not
transgressing or fighting is applicable whether that is done with or
without weapons. The mediator who tries to reconcile between the
two sides should do whatever is needed to achieve the goal, as long
as it is in accordance with the command of Allah. If the goal can be
achieved without resorting to the use of weapons, then that is the best
solution; if there is no other option than using force, then he should
do that until they comply.
The words of Allah (&): BBut if it complies, then make peace
between them with justice, and be fair: for Allah loves those who are
fair [and just]), mean that if the group that is wrong gives up its
transgression, after fighting, and accepts the command and rnle of
Allah, then the Muslims must be fair when judging between the two
groups. They should judge in accordance with the ruling of Allah and
put a stop to the abuse by the disobedient group; it must cease its
transgression and give to the other group what is due, so that the
fighting will not be resumed later. And be just, 0 you mediators, in
judging between them, for Allah loves those who are just and gives
them the best rewards. This is a command to be just in all matters.'
The Prophet (s)
said: "Those who are fair and just will be with Allah
on thrones of light, at the right hand of the Most Merciful (g),
and
both of His hands are right hands, those who are fair and just in their

22

m e Battles o f the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

rnlings and towards their families and those who are under their
Then Allah enjoined reconciliation among the Muslims in
cases other than fighting, even in the slightest dispute. He (&) said:
he Believers are but a single Brotherhood, so make peace and
reconciliation between your two [contending] brothers) (Qur'an 49:
10). This verse contains one of the basic principles that govem
relationships between one Muslim and another.'' Allah ( B )did not
say that either or both groups are disbelievers, even in a case where
fighting occurs between them. The most deserving of people to be
included in the meaning of this verse are the leaders of the believers,
the noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), whether
that is with regard to the Battle of the Camel or Siffeen. Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali
applied this verse as he strove to bring about
reconciliation, and T a a h and az-Zubayr responded, but the
followers of Abdullah ibn Saba' were the cause of the fighting that
broke out between the two sides, as we will discuss below.

(4)

Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali (&) was also keen to set things
straight with the people of Syria, and he did all that he could through
peaceful means. However, Mu'iwiyah stipulated that the killers of
'Uthmh (4)
should be handed over, and fighting took place.
MuC2wiyah'sopinion was mistaken; the correct view was that of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&). He only unsheathed his sword after
all attempts at reconciliation had failed, intending for Mu'iwiyah
(&) to follow the command of Allah ( B )and hear and obey, and to
bring about unity in the Muslim state.

(s),

The words of Allah
(The Believers are but a single
Brotherhood) affirmed the brotherhood of faith among all the
Muslims who are engaged in fighting each other. It is appropriate that
this should be applicable to 'Ali, T a a h and az-Zubayr (may Allah
be pleased with them all) in the Battle of the Camel and to what

'Ali ibn Abi T a b

23

happened with Mu'gwiyah at Siffeen. Hence it becomes clear to us
that the fighters at the Battle of the Camel and at Siffeen were
believers on both sides. These historical events should not be used as
a pretext for undermining the position of the Companions, trying to
deny that they were believers, or spreading distorted and fabricated
stories about them. To refute those false notions concerning them, it
is sufficient to note that this verse confirms that they were brothers in
faith. We will discuss what happened between them in more detail
below.
Allah (s)
states that the believers are brothers in faith. They
are united by a single principle, which is faith, so reconciling
between two disputing brothers is necessary. To emphasise the
importance of reconciling between two brothers, Allah (@) enjoined
taqwa in this context. The basis of this attempt to reconcile, and in all
your affairs, should be taqwa, demonstrated by adhering to truth and
justice. Do not be biased, and do not incline to one of the two parties;
they are all your brothers, and Islam treats all people equally, so there
is no differentiation between them. Do that so that you may receive
mercy because of piety, which means adhering to the commands and
heeding the prohibitions.i1
The verse states that reconciling between brothers and fearing
Allah (&) is the cause of the mercy of Allah coming down, so this
highlights the great importance of reconciliation between ~ u s l i r n slZ.
It may be noted that he said: Fear Allah when two men dispute; he did
not say that with regard to reconciling between two Muslim groups,
because when two men dispute, there is the fear that the conflict may
widen, but when two groups dispute, the impact of the turmoil and
mischief is already affecting e~eryone.'~

In the verse, (The Believers are but a single Brotherhood), the
Arabic word innama (translated here as 'but') is exclusive. It means
that there is no brotherhood except among the believers; there is no

24

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue ofarbitration

brotherhood between a believer and a disbeliever, because Islam is
the bond tbat unites its followers. It also indicates that the command
to reconcile is only issued because there is brotherhood in Islam and
not among the disbelievers. If a disbeliever is a dhimmi or a person
living under Muslim protection, then it is obligatory to take care of
him, protect him and relieve him of oppression, just as it is obligatory
to help the Muslim and support him in general if his opponent is a
non-Muslim in a state of war against the ~ u s l i m s . ' ~
Ibn al-'Arabi said: "This verse is the main guideline when
fighting Muslims who base their reasons for fighting on
misinterpretations. It was a reference point for the Companions on
this issue, and the Prophet (g)
referred to it when he said: ' 'Amm2r
(ibn Y2sir) will be killed by the group that is in the wrong,' meaning
that fighting the group that is in the wrong is a communal obligation;
if some of the Muslims undertake to do that, the obligation is waived
from the rest. Hence some of the Companions (may Allah be pleased
with them) stayed away from this matter, such as Sa'd ibn Abi
W a q q i ~Abdullah
,
ibn 'Umar, Muhammad ibn Maslamah and others.
Each of them gave his apologies, and Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
accepted that from them."15 There are many rulings that we will
discuss when we look at the various events that took place among the
Companions.
This system, of arbitration and fighting the group tbat is in the
wrong until it complies with the command of Allah
is regarded
as a pioneering system that came before other human attempts at
setting up systems of that nature; it is perfect and free from the flaws
and defects that are apparent in all imperfect and feeble human
attempts. Moreover, it has the attributes of being clean, honest, just
and universal, because referring to that system is like referring to
something that is not affected by any ulterior motives or whims and
desires, and is not affected by any shortcomings or defects.16 The

(s),

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

attempts to bring about reconciliation did not cease from the moment
fighting broke out until they were crowned by the great reconciliation
that was planned by Amir d-Mu'mineeu d-Hasan ibn 'Ab

(4).

1. Events that preceded the
Battle of the Camel
The murder of 'Uthm2n (A)was a cause of many other
difficulties, and it cast its shadow over the turbulent events that
followed it. Many factors contributed to the murder of 'Uthmzn
(&), including: prosperity and its impact on society; changes in the
nature of society during his reign; the fact that 'Uthmin (&) came
after 'Umar (&);
the departure of the senior Companions from
,.
Madinah; tribalism; the cessation of conquest; ignorant displays of
piety; personal ambitions on the p m of some people; the conspiracy
of those who were full of hate; careful preparation of a list of
accusations against 'Uthmin (&); various ways and means that
were used to stir up the people; and the role of Abdullah ibn Saba' in
the turmoil. These causes and reasons have been discussed in detail
in my book Tayseer al-Kareem al-Manncin j? Seerat 'Uthmrin ibn
xff;n.17
The people loved 'Uthmh (&) very much because of his
good conduct, his closeness to the Messenger of Allab (g),
the
badiths that praised him, and the fact that he married two of the
Prophet's daughters (which is why he was called bun-~oora~n)."
He was one of the senior Companions who were given the glad
tidings of paradise. He was subjected to injustice during his lifetime
by some of the thugs; be could have put an end to them, but he
refrained for fear of being the fust one to shed the blood of the
Ummah of Muhammad (g).
His policy in dealing with the turmoil
was based on forbearance, deliberation and justice. He prevented the

26

The Battles uf the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) from fighting the
rebels and chose to protect the Muslims by giving his own life. Hence
his killing was the cause of a great deal more turmoil, and his murder
cast a shadow on the subsequent turbulent events.
His killing had a great impact on the Muslims. The Muslim
society fractured as a result of this major event, and the people
became divided. What may increase his status and prove his
innocence of everything that was attributed to him is the attitude of
the other Companions towards his murder. They were all agreed that
he was innocent and that those who shed his blood should he
punished, but they differed as to how that was to he achieved. This
will he discussed below, but fimt we want to shed some light on the
role of Abdullah ihn Saba' in the turmoil in general:

1.1. Impact of the Saba'is in causing turmoil
1.1.1.The Saba'is - fact or fiction?
The reality of Abdullah ibn Saba'
The early scholars were unanimous in agreeing that the Saba'is
existed; there were no exceptions among them. A few modem
scholars, most of whom are Shias, disagreed with that. They claimed
that the Saba'is were a product of the imagination of Sayf ibn 'Umar
at-Tameerni. Some of the scholars of biography criticised Sayf in the
field of hadith narration, but the scholars regard him as acceptable in
the field of historical reports. Moreover, Ibn 'As& narrated many
reports that mention Ahdullah ibn Saba', and these reports do not
include Sayf ibu 'Umar as one of the narrators. Al-Albini rnled that
some of these reports were sound in terms of their chains of
narration." These are in addition to the many reports narrated from
Ibn Saba' in the Shia books of sects, biographies and hadith, in which
there is no mention of this Sayf ibn 'Umar at all.

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

27

Creating doubts about the existence of Abdullah ibn Saba'
began with two purposes: on the one hand, to deny the role of the
Jewish element in planting the seeds of turmoil among the Muslims,
and on the other hand, to point the finger of accusation against the
Companions. The rogue elements attempted to tarnish the bnght
image of the Companions in the minds of Muslims, by claiming that
the Companions caused the turmoil. Some contemporary writers, all
of whom were Riiiifidi Shias, followed in their footsteps and denied
the existence of Abdullah ibn Saba' for their own purposes. These
failed attempts were aimed at proving that their madh-hab had
nothing to do with its real founder, c o n t r q to the facts on which all
earlier scholars, including the Shia, were agreed.
It is worth pointing out that those so-called Sunnis who denied
the existence of Abdnllah ibn Saba' were among those who were
influenced by, or studied under, the Orientalists. What level of
shamelessness and ignorance have these people reached? His
biography filled books of history and Muslim sects, his deeds were
transmitted by narrators and his story was known throughout the
Muslim world. The historians, scholars of hadith and authors of
books on sects and groups, biography, literature and genealogy who
discussed the Saba'is were all unanimously agreed that tbe Abdullah
ibn Saba' who appears in accounts of the turmoil was a real historical
character. The reports of Ibn Saba's role in the turmoil are not limited
to Tareekh at-Tabari and are not based only on the reports of Sayf
ibn 'Umar at-Tameemi contained therein; there are widespread
reports in the nmations of earlier scholars and throughout the books
that record the events of Islamic history and discuss the views of
different sects during that period. However, the advantage that Imam
at-Tabari had over others is that he had more abundant material and
more details. Hence shedding doubts on these events without any
evidence, on the grounds that Abdullah ibn Saba' is only mentioned

28

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

in reports via Sayf ibn 'Umar, even after it has been proved that he is
mentioned in sound reports that do not include Sayf ibn 'Umar in
their chains of narration, as we have mentioned above, only leads to
rejecting all these reports and labelling those narrators and scholars as
foolish people who are distorting the historical facts. Since when
does an academic methodology based on pure rational thinking form
a basis for rejection, as opposed to texts and corroborating reports? Is
this methodology based on overlooking and ignoring all the sources,
both earlier and later, which prove that Ibn Saba' was a real person?20
Ibn Saba' is mentioned in many hooks of Ahl as-Sunnah, including
the following:
The Saba'is are mentioned by A'sha ~amad2n'' (d. 83 AH).
He lampooned al-MukhGr ibn Abi 'Ubayd ath-Tbaqafi and his
supporters from Kufah, after he fled with the nobles of the bibes of
Kufah to Basra, by saying: "I bear witness that you are Saba'is, and I
am aware of you, 0 guardians of d i ~ b e l i e f . " ~ ~
There is a report from ash-Sha'bi (d. 103 AH/721 CE) saying
that the first one who told lies was Abdnllah ibn ~ a b a ' .Ibn
~~
~ a b e e b '(d.
~ 245 AW860 CE) mentioned Ibn Saba' and regarded
him as one of the children of the Ethiopian women.25 Abn '&im
Khushaysh ibn &ram (d. 253 AH) narrated a report about 'Ali (&>)
burning some of the companions of Ibn Saba', in his book al~sti~rirnah.'~
~l-~%hid&'~
(d. 255 AH) is regarded as one of the first to
refer to Abdullah ibn ~ a b a ' hut
, ~ ~his repoa is not the fist, as Dr.
Jaw2d 'Ali thinks."
The story of 'Alj ibn Abi T2ib (&) burning a group of
heretics is mentioned in sound reports that are narrated in the books
of haditl~.~'
There is nothing s m g e about using the word 'heretic'
with regard to Abdullah ihn Saba' and his group. Ibn Taymiyah said:
'The Rsfifidi ideas started with the heretic Abdnllah ibn Saha'."31
Adh-Dhahabi said: "Ahdullah ibn Saba' was one of the extreme

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

29

heretics; he was misguided and misled others."3z Ihn Hajar said:
"Abdullah ibn Saba' was one of the extreme heretics... he had
followers who were called Saba'is, who believed in the divinity of
'Ali ihn Abi Tgib (&). 'Ali burned them with fire during his
caliphate."33
Ihn Saba' is also mentioned in the books of hadith criticism.
Ibn Ebb211 (d. 354 AH) said: "Al-Kalbi, Muhammad ibn as-SCib d Ikhbiri, was a Saba'i, one of the followers of Ahdullah ibn Saba', one
of those who said that 'Ali did not die and that he will come hack to
this world before the Hour begins. If they saw a cloud, they would
say: 'The Amir al-Mu'mineen (meaning 'Ali) is in it.'"34 The books
of genealogy also confirm that the Saba'i group is named after
Abdullah ibn Saba', and that they are a group of extreme Rifidis.
Ahdullah ihn Saba' was originally from Yemen, a Jew who became a
Muslim outwardly. Sayf ihn 'Umar was not the only source for
reports about Abdullah ibn Saba'. In his Tareekh, Ihn 'As%
nmated reports which have no connection to Sayf, which confirm
the existence of l[bn ~ a h a ' ?Shaykh
~
d-Islam Ihn Taymiyah (d. 728
AH) stated that the origins of the Rzdi sect lay with the hypocrites
and heretics, and that it was the invention of the heretic Ibn Saba',
who exaggerated about 'Ali (&), claiming that he should have been
caliph, that he was appointed by a clear text, and that he was
infallible.36 ~ s h - ~ h i t i h(d.
i ~ 790
~
AH) pointed out that the
innovation of the Saba'is was one that had to do with belief in the
existence of another god besides Allah (g),
and this was an
innovation that differed from others?' In al-Khutat by al-Maqreezi
(d. 845 AH), it says that Ahdullah ibn Saba' appeared at the time of
was the rightfully appointed
'Ali (&), saying that 'Ali
successor39 and would return, and promoting belief in the
transmigration of ~ o u l s . ~

(4)

The Shia sources which mention Ihn Saba' include the following:

30

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

Al-Kashshi narrated that Muhammad ihn Qawlawiyyah said:
"Sa'd ihn Ahdullah told me: Ya'qoob ihn Yazeed and Muhammad
ihn 'Eesa told me, from 'Ali ihn Mahziyiir, from Faddaah ihn
Ayyooh al-Azdi, that AbZn ihn 'Uthmfin said: I heard Ahu Abdnllah
say: 'May Allah (&) curse Ahdullah ihn Saha', for he claimed that
('Ali) was divine, hut by Allah, ('Ali) was an obedient slave. Woe to
the one who tells lies about us. If people say of us things that we do
not say about ourselves, we disavow ourselves of them before
~ l l a h . " ' ~ The
'
chain of narration of this report is sound.42
In al-Khijhl, al-Qummi narrated the same report, hut in
connection with a different chain of narration. The author of Raw@
al-Janncit mentioned Ibn Saha' in a quotation from Imam as-Sidiq,
who cursed Ibn Saba' and accused him of lying, fabricating,
broadcasting secrets and m i ~ i n t e r p r e t i n ~In. ~ ~his hook, Dr.
Sulaymh al-'Awdah mentioned a number of texts with which the
Shia hooks are filled, and their reports from Ahdullah ihn Saba',
which are more akin to recorded documents that condemn anyone
among the later Shia who tries to deny the existence of Ahdnllah ihn
Saha' or shed doubt on the reports that refer to him on the basis of
paucity or weakness of the reports.&
Ibn Saba' was an actual historical figure, concerning whom
there is no confusion in either the Snnni or Shia sources, earlier or
later. This is also the view of most of the Mentalists such as Julius
~ a l h a u s e n ?Van
~ ~ n l t o nLevi
, ~ ~ de la ~ i d a ~oldziher?'
, ~ ~
Ronald

, ~ ~Dwight ~ o n a l d s o nFor
. ~ ~a few Mentalists such as
Caetani and Bernard ~ewis," Ibn Saba' remains a doubtful figure or
no more than a myth; Fred Lander remains ~ncertain.~'
However, we
should remember that we do not rely on these authors with regard to
our history.
The one who studies these sources, ancient and modem, Snnni
and Shia, will he certain that Ahdullah ibn Saha' really existed and

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

31

that his existence is supported by the historical reports. The books of
'aqeedah, hadith, biography, genealogy, literature and language also
mention him a great deal. This idea was accepted by modem scholars
and researchers. It seems that the &st ones to shed doubt on the
existence of Ibn Saba' were some of the Orientalists; then this doubt
was shared by the majority of modem Shia, and some of them denied
his existence altogether. Among modem Arab researchers, there
were some who admired the ideas of the Orientalists and were
influenced by the books of the modem Shia. Nevertheless, none of
them has anything to support the suspicions and denials except doubt
itself, which is based on whims and desires, speculations and
assumptions.53Whoever wishes to find out more about the Sunni,
Orientalist and Shia references which mention Ibu Saba' may refer to
Tahqeeq Mawiqif as-Sahibah fil-Fitnah by Dr. Muhammad
Amhazon and 'Abdullah ibn Saba' wa Atharuhu j5 AhdZth al-Fimah
fi Sadr al-Islam by Dr. Sulaymh ibn Hamad al-'Awdah.

1.1.2. The role of Abdullah ibn Saba'
in stining up fitnah
In the last years of 'Uthmin's caliphate, signs of trouble in the
Muslim society began to loom on the horizon, due to the changes that
we have listed previously. Some of the Jews seized this opportnnity
to stir up trouble, by using the tactic of taqiyyah and pretending to be
Muslim. Among them was Abdullah ibn Saba', who is also known as
Ibn as-Sawda'. We should not exaggerate his role in the fitnah, as
some have
but we should not cast doubts on it either, or
discount the role that he played. His role was only one of several
factors, but it was the most prominent and the most dangerous. The
atmosphere of turmoil paved the way for him, but there were other
factors that helped him too. All that Ibn Saba' did was to spread
views and beliefs that he fabricated himself. They reflected his

32

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

hateful nature, and he propagated them for his own purposes, namely
to introduce new ideas into the Muslim society in order to destroy its
unity and stir up unrest. He planted seeds of division among the
people, and that was one of several factors that led to the murder of
the caliph 'Uth&(&)
and the division of the Ummah into factions
and parties.55
To summarize what he did, he began quoting correct ideas, but
then he leapt to wrong conclusions that found acceptance among the
simple-minded, the extremists and those who were swayed by whims
and desires. He followed convoluted ways whereby he deceived
those who gathered around him. He started quoting Qur'an and
misinterpreting it in accordance with his false claims, like when he
said: "It is strange that people believe that 'Eesa is coming back, hut
they do not accept that Muhammad is coming hack, when Allah (g)
says, (Verily, He Who has given you [O Muhammad] the Qur'an [i.e.
ordered you to act on its laws and to preach it to others] will surely,
bring you hack to Ma'dd [place of retum1,fr (Qur2an 28: 85) and
Muhammad is more deserving of coming back than ' ~ e s a . "He.
~~
also resorted to false analogy in trying to claim that 'Ali (&) was the
rightful heir appointed by the Prophet (g)
to succeed him, he said:
"There were one thousand prophets, and each prophet had a
rightfully appointed heir, and 'Ali was the rightfully appointed heir
of Muhammad." Then he said: "Muhammad was the seal of the
prophets, and 'Ali was the seal of the heirs."57
When these ideas had become entrenched in the hearts of his
followers, he moved on to his ultimate aim, which was to make the
people rebel against the caliph 'Uthm2n (A).That happened to
coincide with the whims and desires of some of the people when he
said to them: "Who does more wrong than the one who did not fulfil
the final wishes of the Messenger of Allah (g),
who pushed aside
'Ali, the rightfully appointed successor of the Messenger of Allah

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

33

(g),
and took control of the Ummah?' After that, he told them:
" 'Uthm2n took it unlawfully; here is the rightfully appointed
successor of the Messenger of Allah (@J. Get up and do something
about it. Start by criticising your governors, and pretend that you are
enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, so that people
will be inclined towards you, and call them to this matter."58

He sent out his agents, and he wrote to people in the regions,
who were corrupted by his ideas; they wrote to him and propagated
their views in secret, pretending to enjoin what is good and forbid
what is evil. They started writing to people in the regions, mentioning
the faults of their govemors, and they corresponded with their
counterparts in other regions, telling them what they were doing.
They spread their false propaganda all over, aiming for something
other than what they appeared to he seeking; they even sent letters to
Madinah. The people in the regions said: 'We are free of what others
are suffering kom," but the people of Madinah received letters from
all over and said: "We are better off than the rest of the people."59
From this, we can see the methods followed by Ibn Saba'. He
wanted to give the impression that there was a rift between two of the
senior Companions by showing that one of them, 'Ali (A),
had been
deprived of his rights, whereas the other, 'Uthm2n (&), was a
usurper. Next, he tried to stir up the people against their govemors,
especially in Kufah, in the name of enjoining what is good and
forbidding what is evil; as a result, they started to revolt against their
governors for the slightest reasons. He focused on the Bedouin in this
campaign, because he found in them suitable material for carrying
out his plan. He gained the support of the religious people among
them by using the idea of enjoining what is good and forbidding what
is evil. He gained the support of those who had worldly ambitions by
means of false rnmours against 'Uthmh (&), such as the claim that
he was biased in favour of his relatives and was spending money

34

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeeeen and the issue of arbitration

from the public treasnry of the Muslims on them, that he had
allocated grazing land for himself only, and other accusations and
criticisms by means of which Ibn Saba' managed to rally the thugs
against 'Uthmiin (&). Then he started inciting his followers to send
letters relaying temble news about their cities to people in other
provinces, so that people in all regions would think that the situation
everywhere had gotten so had that it could not get any worse. Those
who benefited from this situation were the Saba'is, because when the
people believed their propaganda, they would be able to light the
spark of fitnah in the Muslim society.60 'Uthmiin (&) realised that
there were plots in other provinces, and that the Ummab was facing a
bad time. He said: "By AUah, the millstone (of fitnah) will soon start
tuming, and it will be better for 'Uthmk if he dies and does not set it
in m ~ t i o n . " ~ '
The place where Ibn Saba' found his niche was in Egypt. He
started organizing his campaign agajnst 'Uthmiin (&) there, urging
the people to go to Madinah and stir up unrest on the premise that
'Uthmk (&) had become caliph unlawfully by snatching it from
'Ali (&), who was the true heir of the Messenger of Allah (@)F2 He
deceived them by means of letters that he claimed to have received
from the senior Companions, inciting the people against 'Uthmk
(&)F3 However, when the Bedouin came to Madinah and met with
the Companions, they denied writing the letters that had been
attributed to them, and the Bedouins did not receive any
encouragement from them. They found that 'Uthmk (&) paid
attention to the rights of others, and he debated with them concerning
the accusations against him. He refuted their lies and explained that
his deeds were based on sincere intentions, until one of these
Bedouin, MSllik ibn al-Ashtar an-Nakha'i, said: "Perhaps it is a plot
that has been drawn up against him and

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

35

Adh-Dhahabi is of the view that Abdullah ibn Saba' started the
fitnah in Egypt, where he planted the seeds of grudges and criticism
against the governors first, then against the ruler ' ~ t h m i l n ?Ibn
~
Saba' was not alone; his agents were at work among the network of
conspirators, using their craftiness and trickery to recruit the
Bedouin, the religious people among them and others. Ibn Katheer
narrated that among the causes of the incitement against ' U t M
(&) was the emergence of Ibn Saba', who went to Egypt and spread
rnmonrs among the people that he fabricated himself, by which many
people in Egypt were deceived.66
The famous historians and scholars of both the earlier and later
generations of this Urnmah are agreed that Ibn Saba' appeared among
the Muslims with ideas, plans and plots aimed at diverting the
Muslims from their faith and from obeying their ruler, and spreading
division and disputes among them. The thugs rallied around him,
leading to the formation of the Saba'i group, which was one of the
factors in the fitnah that ended with the murder of the caliph 'Uthmk
ibn 'Affb (&). It seems that the Saba'i plots were very well
organized. They were very skilled in directing their 'missionaries'
and spreading their ideas, because they had the means of propaganda
to influence the thugs and dregs of society. They were also active in
forming branches in Basra, Kufah and Egypt, exploiting tribal
sentiments and exploiting the wealmesses of the Bedouin, slaves and
freed slaves, based on knowledge of what they wanted to hear.67

1.2. Different views among the Companions
concerning the way to carry out retaliation
against the murderers of 'Uthmsn (&)
The difference that emerged between Amir al-Mu'mineen, on
the one hand, and Ta&ah, ai-Zubayr and 'kisbah on the other, and

36

Tke Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

after that between 'Ali and Mu'iwiyah, was not because these people
rejected the caliphate and leadership of Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(A),or that they denied that he was entitled to be the caliph and
ruler in charge of the Muslims. That was something upon which they
all agreed
Ibn Hazm said: "Mu'2wiyah never denied 'Ali's virtue or his
entitlement to the caliphate. But in his opinion, he believed that
priority should be given to settling the issue of retaliation with regard
to the murderers of 'Uthmin (A)over the issue of allegiance, and he
thought that he himself was most entitled to seek retaliation for the
blood of ' ~ t h m % n . " ~ ~
Ibn Taymiyah said: "Mu'iwiyah did not claim to be the caliph,
and allegiance was not sworn to him as caliph when he fought 'Ali
(&). He did not fight on the basis that he was a caliph or on the basis
that he deserved that position. Mu'iwiyah's party affiimed that 'Ali
(&) was the caliph, and Mu'iwiyah would confirm to anyone who
asked him that 'Ali (&) was the caliph. Neither Mu'2wiyah nor his
companions thought of initiating fighting against 'Ali and his
companions, and they did not do that."69 Ibn Taymiyah also said:
"Each of the two groups confirmed that Mu'iwiyah was not as
qualified as 'Ali with regard to being caliph, and that he could not be
caliph when it was possible to appoint 'Ali to that position. 'Ali's
superiority, seniority, knowledge, religious commitment, courage
and all his virtues were obvious and well known to him, as was also
the case with regard to his fellow caliphs Abu Bakr, 'Umar and
'Uthmin (may Allah be pleased with them all)."70
The difference of opinion did not result from rejection of
'Ali's caliphate; the difference was only concerning the issue of
bringing the murderers of 'Uthmsn
to justice. Even then, their
difference of opinion was not about this issue itself; rather it was
about the way in which to bring them to justice. Amir al-Mu'mineen

(4)

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

37

'Ali (&) agreed with Mue?iwiyah in principle that the killers of
'Uthm2n (&) must be brought to justice, but his view was that the
issue of bringing them to justice should be set aside until things
settled down and unity was achieved.'l
An-Nawawi said: "It should be noted that the reason for these
battles was that the issues were not clear. Because they were so
unclear, they held different views, and three groups emerged:
- a group whose view was that one party was in the right,

and that those who differed with them were transgressors;
they thought that they had to support this party and fight
the transgressors, according to what they believed, and that
it was not permissible for the one who reached that
conclusion to withhold help and support from the leader
who was in the right by fighting the transgressors,
according to this belief;
- a group that held the opposite view; they thought that the

other party was in the right, so it became obligatory for
them to support that party and fight those who transgressed
against them;
- a third party that was undecided about the issue and

confused about it aud did not reach any conclusion as to
which party was more in the right; they kept away from
both and believed that this staying away was what they
were required to do with regard to this situation, because it
was not permissible for them to help anyone in fighting
other Muslims unless it was clear to them that they
deserved to be fought, and that if they concluded that one
of the two parties was closer to the right, it would not be
permissible for them to withhold their support in fighting
the transgre~sors."~~

after the murder of 'Uthmh (L&)?~In Makkah, negotiations began
with 'L'ishah (I&) about going out on a campaign in pursuit of the
murderers. There was heavy psychological pressure on those who felt
that they had done nothing to stop the murder of the wronged caliph.
They blamed themselves for letting him down, even though 'Uthmin

from doing so, because he wanted to offer himself as a sacrifice for
the sake of Allah (&). They thought that there was no way to expiate
this sin except by going out to seek vengeance. 'L'ishah (I&,) said:
" 'Uthmh was slain wrongfully, and by Allah, I shall certainly seek
vengeance for his blood."74 Talhah said: "There were some
shortcomings on my part with regard to ' U t h d , and there is no way
I can ever repent except to shed my own blood in vengeance for his
blood."75 And ai-Zubayr said: "Let us inspire the people so that we
may seek vengeance for his blood, lest it be forgotten, because
forgetting it will lead to the weakening of the authority of Allah ( B )
among us forever. If we do not deter people from doing this again,
there will be no leader except that people of that kind will kill him."76
This intense pressure on nerves and souls was sufficient to stir
people up and motivate them to go out on the campaign. When they
went, they realised that they were going out to face unknown
turmoils, and each one of them left his home not expecting to return
to it. The children bade farewell weeping, and the day when these
people left Makkah for Basra was known as the day of wailing, a day
that was unprecedented with regard to weeping for 1slam.7~

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

A number of factors in Makkah made them think seriously of
striving to achieve their goal. One was the fact that the Umayyads
had fled from Madinah and settled in Makkah. In addition, Abdullah
ibn ' h i r -the governor of Basra at the time of 'Uthmin - was in
Makkah urging the people to go out and offering them material help.
Ya'la ibn Umayyah, who had left Yemen to help the caliph 'Uthmin,
had learned upon his arrival in Makkah that the caliph had been
killed. He had with him considerable amounts of money, weapons
and mounts, all of which be offered as help in pursuing the murderers
of 'Uthmb (&). This was sufficient to encourage those who were
looking for a way to pursue the murderers.
They had the means to gather a force to pursue the murderers
of 'Uthmk (&), but where would they begin? A discussion took
place among them as to which direction they should take. Some of
them, led by 'kishah ($&), said that Madinah was where they should
go. Another view w a ~
that they should head towards Syria, so that
they could rally there against the murderers of 'Uthmb (&). After a
lengthy discussion, they settled on Basra. There were too many of the
rebels in Madinah, and they would not be able to confront them and
fight them because they were fewer in number, and Syria was already
under control because Mu'2wiyah was there. Hence going to Basra
was most appropriate at that point, because it was the least strong of
the cities; from there they hoped to be able to achieve their aims."
Their plan and mission were clear before they set out, during
their march and when they reached Basra: the intent was to seek
vengeance for the murder of 'Uthmb (&),
.. to set things straight, to
inform the people of what the murderers had done and to enjoin good
and forbid
Their demand was to cany out one of the hadd
punishments of Allah
If the murderers of 'Uthm2n (&) were
not punished, then every leader would be vulnerable to murder by
people of that nature." As for the way in which they envisaged doing

1

40

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue ofarbitration

that, they intended to enter Basra and then Kufah, seeking help from
its people and others against the killers of 'Uthmzn (&). Then they
would call upon the people of other cities to join them, so that they
could comer the murderers of 'Uthmin (&) who were present in the
army of 'Ali and seize them with the minimum possible c a s n a l t i e ~ . ~ ~
The campaign to Basra and the anger that stirred the
Companions were not as straightforward as they may have appeared
to people. Their purpose was not simply to avenge the murder of
'Uthmk (&>), as if he were just an ordinary person who had been
killed, even though this also would involve a transgression of one of
the sacred limits of Allah (&) that dictated getting angry and sending
armies to seek revenge. This was much more serious because of the
position and character of 'Uthmin (&,I, his status as caliph, and the
way in which he was killed. It was the assassination of a Sharia
figure, the caliph, whom the Muslims regarded as the deputy of the
Lawgiver in his role of protecting the religion and ruling worldly
affairs in accordance with Shariza3 Hence unlawful transgression
against him constituted transgressing against the Lawgiver and
weakening His authority, as well as disturbing law and order for the
~uslims.~~
'kishah, Ta&ah and az-Zubayr, along with the people who
accompanied them, were striving to create a groundswell of Islamic
public opinion to confront this Saba'i gang who had murdered
'Uthmzn (&) and had since gained significant power. They meant
to do this by making the Muslims aware of what these Saba'i thugs,
who came from different regions and tribes, and the Bedouins and
slaves who supported them, had done. Among the group of
Companions that held the same view as 'i'ishah (I&), it became
clear that the criminals and Saba'is had a presence in 'Ali's army.
They believed that this was why it was difficult for 'Ali (&) to
confront them, because he feared for the people of Madinah.

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

41

Hence they had to try to explain the situation to the Muslims
and gamer support for the party that was demanding implementation
of the hadd punishments, so that this could be accomplished with the
minimal loss of innocent lives. That was undoubtedly a goal which
'Ali (&) was striving to achieve, too; in fact, the reports that we
have seen about the discussion among az-Zubayr and Tabah and 'Ali
refer to that. Their plan, and their intention of informing the people of
what was happening and explaining matters to them, proves that they
were fully aware of the situation. They recognised that the Saba'is
had deceived the masses, and they understood how they had planted
their ideas in a way which would continue to weaken the Ummah to
such an extent that it would not know any peace.
Hence there was no alternative but to confront the Saba'i plan
in the field of ideas, so as to cancel out their actions. This can clearly
be seen in the sound reportsa5in which 'A'ishah (I&)speaks of the
aims of this campaign. At-Tabari narrated that ' ~ t h k 2 nihn Hunayf,
who was 'Ali's governor in Basra, sent word to 'pishah (I&)when
she arrived in Basra, asking her why she had come. She s2d: "By
Allah, a woman in my position should not go out on a campaign
without having a clear reason and making it clear to her children
(meaning the Muslims). The thugs of various cities and tribes have
invaded the sanctuary of the Messenger of Allah (g)and have
committed a great deal of wrongdoing there, and they have offered
refuge to the wrongdoers. Therefore they deserve the curse of Allah
( B )and of His Messenger, as they killed the leader of the Muslims
for no reason. They shed blood unlawfully, stole h a r h wealth and
violated the sanctity of the sacred land and the sacred month. They
transgressed against honour and killed troops. They settled in the
place of people who did not want them to settle among them; they
caused a great deal of harm but did not bring any benefit. I have come
out among the Muslims to inform them of what these people have
done, and of the pain and suffering of the people we have left behind,

42

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration
1

and to tell them (the Muslims) what they should do in order to help set
things straight." Then she recited the verse: (There is no good in most
of their secret talks save [in] him who orders Sadaqah [charity in
Allah's Cause], or M a 'roof [Islamic Monotheism and all the good and
righteous deeds which Allah has ordained], or conciliation between
manhind) (Qur'an 4: 114). Thus people joined for the purpose of
setting things straight for those whom Allah (&) and the Messenger
of Allah (g)
enjoined that, young and old, male and female. "This is
what we are trying to achieve, to enjoin you to do what is right and
forbid you from doing evil, and we urge you to change it."86
Ibn Hihhh narrated that 'kishah (%) wrote to Ahu Moosa
al-Ash'ari, 'Ali's governor in Kufah, saying: "You know about the
murder of 'Uthm2n, and I have come out to set things right among the
people. Tell the people in your city to stay in their houses so that we
can achieve what they like of setting the Muslims' affairs straight."87
'ALi sent al-Qa'qP ihn 'Amr to 'kishah and the people with her to
ask them why she had come. Al-Qa'qP entered upon her, greeted her
with s a l b and said: "0 my mother, what caused you to leave your
home and come to this city?" She said: "0 my son, it is to set the
people's affairs straight."88

After the end of the battle on the day of the Camel, 'Ali came
to 'A'ishah (may Allah he pleased with them both) and said to her:
"May Allah forgive you." She said: "And you too. I only wanted to
set things straight."89 Thus we learn that she only went out on this
campaign to set things straight among the people, and this is the
refutation of those among the R$fi@ Shia who slandered 'kishah
and said that she left her house after Allah ( B )had commanded
he; to stay in it, in the verse (And stay in your houses, and do not
display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance) (Qur'an 33:
33). The scholarly consensus is that travelling for the purpose of
doing a righteous deed does not contradict the idea of staying in one's

(a)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

43

house and not going out. This is what 'kishah, the Mother of the
Believers ($;),
thought when she went out to set things straight
among the Muslims, accompanied by her mahram and the son of her
sister, AbduUab ibn a z - ~ u b a ~ r . ~ ~
Ibn Taymiyah said, refuting the Rsifidis concerning this issue:
"She (I&)
did not display herself as in the times of ignorance. The
.i
command to stay in their houses does not mean that women should
never go out for some purpose that is enjoined, such as going out for
hajj and 'umrah, or going out with her husband when he travels. This
verse was revealed during the lifetime of the Prophet (@J, and the
Messenger of Allah (g)
took his wives with him on his journeys
after that, as he took 'A'ishah (@) and others with him during his
farewell pilgrimage. He sent 'kishah with her brother 'AbdurR,who seated her behind him on his mount, and he took her to
start her 'nmrah from at-Tan'eem. The farewell pilgrimage took
place less than three months before the death of the Prophet (g),
after this verse was revealed. Hence the wives of the Prophet (g)
performed hajj after he died as they had done with him, during the
caliphate of 'Umar (&) and others, and 'Umar would appoint
'Uthmgn or ' ~ b d u r - ~ h ibn
g 'Awf in charge of their caravan. If
the joumey is for a legitimate purpose, then it is permissible. 'A'ishab
believed that this joumey was in the best interests of the Muslims,
and that was her opinion."91
Ibn al-'Arabi said: "As for her going out to the Battle of the
Camel, she did not set out to fight, but the people pinned their hopes
on her and complained to her about how bad the turmoil and
confusion had become. They hoped by her blessing to set things
straight and that the people would show respect for her and comply
when she took a stance among them. She also thought that herself, so
she set out in compliance with the words of AUah (&): @here is no
good in most of their secret talks save [in] him who orders Sadaqah

1

44

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeem and the issue of arbitration

[charity in Allah's Cause], or Ma'roof [Islamic Monotheism and all
the good and righteous deeds which Allah has ordained], or
conciliation between mankind) (Qur'an 4: 114). The command to
reconcile between people and set things straight is addressed to all
people, male or female, free or slave."92
The following are a number of important issues having to do
with her going out:

1.3.1. Was 'kishah forced to go out?
Al-Ya'qoobi claimed that ai-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwim forced
'kishah to go out.93This was the view of the author of al-Amlinah
w a s - ~ i ~ 2 s and
h ~Ibn
~ ~ b i l - ~ a d e e dit; ~was
' also the opinion of ad~ a ~ n o o r iThe
. 9 ~report narrated by adh-Dhahahi indicated that the
one who forced her was Abdullah ibn a z - ~ u b a y r the
, ~ ~son of her
sister Asma'. This report was relied on and quoted by many
researchers, such as Muhammad Sayyid a l - ~ a k e e lwho
, ~ ~ claimed
that ai-Zubayr and Tabah encouraged 'kishah to go out; this claim
was also made by Zzhiyah adoo or ah^^ and others, but it is not correct.
'A'ishah began to demand vengeance for the slaying of 'Uthmzn
(&) from the moment she learned of his murder, long befor6 azZubayr and Tabah and other senior Companions reached Makkah.
It is narrated that when she set off to return to Makkah,
Abdullah ibn ' h r al-Hadrami came to her and said: "Why are you
coming hack, 0 Mother of the Believers?" She said: "I am coming
back because 'Uthmiin has been killed unlawfully, and the affairs of
the Muslims cannot be sound if these thugs continue to cause trouble.
Seek vengeance for the blood of 'Uthmin and thus support Islam."
Abdullah was the first one to respond.100Taaah and z-Zubayr had
not yet left Madinah, they did not leave until four months after the
murder of 'tJthm2n."'

I

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

1.3.2. Was she in conti-01 of those
who were with her?
Among those who went out on the campaign with her (I$+)
were a number of the
'A'ishah was not a woman
who was in control and able to make people do what she wanted, as
Brockelmann claims.'03 At-Tabari's reports confinn that the rest of
the Mothers of the Believers supported her, as did those who were
with her in the effort to put things straight; indeed, a considerable
number of the people of Basra supported her, too.'" These
supporters, whose numbers were not small, were not insignificant
people; Talhah and az-Zubayr described them as the best and most
wise of the people of ~ a s r a , " and
~ 'A'ishah described them as the
righteous.'06 The fact that this number of righteous people supported
her cause could only be the result of strong belief in the cause,
confidence that something could be achieved by this campaign, and
certainty that its purpose was sound. Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali (&)
h e w that, and he refuted the claim made by some people that those
who went out with 'A'ishah were a group of fools, thugs and
hooligans.'07 After the Battle of the Camel, Amir al-Mu'mineen
stood among those of 'pishah's party who had been slain, praying
for mercy for them and recounting their virtues.lo8 We shall see
below that it was not an d
y campaign in which 'A'ishah
controlled and directed immature people; rather it was a campaign in
which some of the senior Companions took

1.3.3. Attitude of the wives of the Prophet (s)
towards those who sought vengeance
for the murder of 'Uthrnk
The wives of the Prophet (g)
had gone for hajj that year to get
away from the turmoil. After news reached the people in Makkah that
'Uthmk (&)
. . had been murdered, they stayed on in Makkah. They

46

The Battles of the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

had lefl the holy city, but they went and back and followed news of
the situation, waiting to see what people would do. When allegiance
was sworn to 'Ali (&), a number of the Companions left Madinah,
not wanting to stay there because of the presence of troublemakers
from other regions. Many of the Companions and the Mothers of the
Believers (may Allah be pleased with them all) gathered in
Makkah.' lo The other Mothers of the Believers agreed with 'A'ishah
about going to Madinah to seek justice. When '.&'ishah, and the
Companions who were with her, decided to go to Basra instead, the
others changed their minds and said: "We will not go anywhere
except Madinah."'" So the idea of seeking vengeance for 'Uthm2n
was not something on which the Mothers of the Believers differed,
but they disagreed when the plan changed from Madinah to Basra.
The Mother of the Believers Hafsah hint 'Umar (I&>) agreed with
'A'ishah about going to Basra, hut her brother ~ b d u i i a hinsisted that
she should not go; this was not based on her personal con~iction."~
She sent her apologies to 'kishah, saying: "Ahdullah has prevented
me from going on the campaign.""3
The commonly known reports indicate that the Mother of the
Believers Umm Salamah (&) did not share the view of 'A'ishah
with regard to going out oncampaign to Basra; rather she shared
'Ali's view."4 The sound reports indicate that she sent her son
'Umar ihn Abi Salamah to 'Ali with the message: "By Allah, he is
dearer to me than my own self; he will go out with you to fight
alongside yon." He went out with 'Ali (&) and remained with
him.'15 This is a report which, upon examination, does not mean that
by sending her son she had a different opinion tfrom the other
Mothers of the Believers with regard to setting things straight among
the Muslims.
'kishah herself, along with those who were with her, did not
think that this campaign meant that they were going against 'Ali

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

47

(&) or rebelling against his caliphate, as we have seen and as events

will confirm to us. We also find nothing in the sound reports to
indicate that Umm Salamah went against the consensus of the
Mothers of the Believers with regard to the importance of setting
things straight.l16 The Mothers of the Believers knew that this
campaign to set things straight among the Muslims came under the
category of a communal obligation, and the guideline concerning
such obligations is that it is not expected of all Muslims to carry out
that duty; it is expected only of those who are qualified to cany it out.
'kishah (&)was fully qualified to carry out that duty because of her
status, age; knowledge and ability. She (I&) was the most
knowledgeable of the Mothers of the Believers &garding Islam and
Shasia, according to Muslim consen~us."~Moreover, she took a
keen interest in current events and was highly educated and cultured.
Her education had begun when she was growing up in the house of
Abu Bakr (&), who had a vast knowledge of Arabic history and
lineages; then she had lived in the house of the Messenger of Allah
(g),
from which had emerged the principles on which the Muslim
state was based. Furthermore, she was the daughter of the first caliph
of the Muslims.
The scholars confirmed this high status of 'kishah. 'Urwah
ibn az-Zubayr said: "I was acquainted with 'A'ishah, and I have
never seen anyone at all who was more knowledgeable of any verse
that was revealed, any obligatory duty, any sunnah, anyone who was
more wen-versed in poetry or narrated more poetry; anyone who was
more knowledgeable of Arabic history and lineage and so foah, or
anyone who had more knowledge of judiciary matters or medicine
than her.""'
Ash-Sha'hi used to mention her and express his
admiration for her understanding and knowledge, then he would say:
"No wonder, when she learned from the Prophet (gJ!"
'Ata' used to
say: 'A'ishah was the most knowledgeable of people and the most
"

48

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

wise."119 Al-Abafibn Qays, the chief of Banu Tameem and one of
the most eloquent of the Arabs, used to say: "I heard the speeches of
Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmh, 'Ali and the caliphs who came after
them, and I never heard words from the mouth of any person that
were more powerful and more beautiful than those of 'A'ishah
(I&,)." Mu'2wiyah used to say something similar.120The Mothers of
the Believers bade farewell to 'A'ishah when she left for Basra, and
this is indicative of their support and encouragement for her in what
she was doing.121

1.3.4. 'pishah's passing by the oasis of al-~aw'ab"~
It is proven with sound chains of narration that 'i'ishah (I&)
.i
passed by the oasis of al-Haw'ab. It was narrated from Yahya ibn
Sa'eed al-Qanh, from Ism2'eel ibn Abi Khi!id, from Qays ibn
Hiizim that the Messenger of Allah (g)
said to his wives: "How will
one of you be when the dogs of al-Haw'ab bark at her?"123 It was
also narrated via Shu'bah from Ism2'eel that when 'A'ishah came to
al-Haw'ab, she heard the barking of dogs, and she said: "I think I
should go back, because the Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'Which
one of yon will the dogs of al-Haw'ab bark at?"' Az-Znbayr said to
her: "Are you going back? Perhaps Allah
will put people's
affairs straight by means of you."124 This version was narrated by
Ya'la ibn 'Ubayd from Ismii'eel, and was recorded by a l - ~ & i m . ' ~ ~
Al-Alb2ni said: "Its chain of narration is very sound." He also said:
"It was classed as such by senior imams of hadith such as Ibn Hibbh,
adh-Dhahabi, Ibn Katheer and E n ~ a j a r . " ' ~ ~

(s)

These are sound reports in which there is nothing misleading
or false, because the Companions would not stoop to that level,
contray to what is claimed in false reports,'27 as we shall see below.
The one who studies these reports, which have been classified as
sound by the scholars, will not find anything in them to suggest that

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

49

'kishah (I&,) should or should not have done the things that she did.
Rather what may be understood from them is that the Prophet (&)
was wondering which one of his wives would pass by the oasis of
Haw'ab. The reports that contain the word 'beware', indicating that
the Prophet (g)
wamed against going there, were not classified as
sound by the scholars; in fact, they were classified as weak. One
example is the report which says, "Beware lest you he there, 0
Humayra." lZ8

2-

Hence the correct view, which we follow, is that the fact that
'kishah (&)passed by the water of al-Haw'ab did not have the
negative effect which was suggested by the fabricated reports. It did
not have any far-reaching effect on ' ~ i s h a h(I&)herself to the point
that she started
seriously of turning hick and giving up the
cause for which she had set out, namely to set matters straight among
the Muslims and correct their mistakes. The matter did not go beyond
a passing thought on her part, in which the possibility of turning back
merely crossed her mind. This is how she expressed it when she said:
"I thought about going back, but it was only an idea that did not last
for long." Then her mission became clear again, after az-Zubayr
reminded her of what Allah (&) might bring about at her hands in
terms of setting things straight among the ~ u s l i m s . ' ~ ~
The issue of the oasis of al-Haw'ab, and the hadiths in which
al-Haw'ab is mentioned, were and still are fertile ground for the Shia
and others, which they use to criticise the Mother of the Believers
'kishah (I&).They criticised her for going out and campaigning to
seek vengeance for the murder of 'Uthm2u (&), and they even went
so far as to deny that her decision was based on valid ijtihiid on her
part; they claimed that she went against the instrnctions of the
Messenger (g)not to go to the oasis of al-Haw'ab. The historical
sources mentioned this story, and it is mentioned by at-Tabari in a
lengthy report that was narrated by Ismi'eel ihn Moosa al-Fa&, of

1

50

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

whom Ibn 'Adiyy said: "They (the scholars) criticised him for being
an extremist and a Shia."I3O Al-Faziti narrated this report from 'Ali
ibn 'Lbis al-Azraq, who is weak according to Ibn Hajar and an~ a s i ' i . ' ~He
' also narrated this report from al-Khac$ib al-Hajri, who
is unknown.'32 This unknown al-Hajri narrated from another
unknown narrator, whose name was Safwgn ibn Qubay'ah alA I p n a ~ i . Finally,
'~~
an even more unknown character is al-'Azni, the
alleged owner of the camel. He was not the owner of the camel; rather
its owner was Ya'la ibn ~ m a ~ ~ a h . ' ~ ~
In the text of this report, the reader may detect a clear whiff of
Shia and RZfidi influence at the end of the report, where it is claimed
that 'Ali (&) thought himself more entitled to the caliphate than
Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmb (may Allah be pleased with them all).
On the contrary, the reports that are proven to be sound indicate
something completely different135Based on the above, it becomes
clear to us that this report is not 50und.l~~
There are other reports
concerning this matter, all of which are false in both chain of
narration and text. The message and aim of these reports is to cast
aspersions on the senior Companions (may AUah be pleased with
them) and to prove that the goal of this campaign was to achieve
worldly, personal gains such as wealth, leadership and so on; that the
ends justified the means; and that in trying to achieve that, they
would not refrain from creating war and turmoil among the Muslims.
These reports focus on two great Companions, Talhah and az~ u b a ~ rThe
. ' ~fabricators
~
of these reports also wanted to confum
that these two Companions and the members of the army who were
with them dared to violate the sacred limits of Allah (g).
The reports
allege that Tabah and az-Zubayr swore in the strongest terms to the
Mother of the Believers that this was not the water of al-Haw'ab;
furthennore, they brought seventy people - and according to
another report, fifty people -to testify that what they said was true.

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

51

This action, according to the R%di Shia al-Mas'oodi, was the first
false witness given in ~ s l a r n These
. ~ ~ ~reports tried to show that
Taltph, z-Zubayr and 'i'ishah were not in harmony and were not
united on one goal. They tried to show that 'A'ishah (I&) sided with
Talhah .. and that deep down in her heart, she was lkping that he
would become caliph because he was from the tribe of Taym just like
her. These reports also suggest that there was intense competition and
rivalry between Talhah and az-Zubayr, and that they were both eager
to become the leader. One cannot ignore the fact that these reports are
not free of severe weakness. In some of them, the chain of narration is
interrnpted, and in some, there are narrators about whom nothing is
known; in some cases both serious faults are present.139Many writers
and historians were influenced by these reports, relied on them and
played a part in propagating them, but they have no basis. These
writers include al-'Aqqid in 'Abqaiiyut 'Ali, Taha Hussein in 'Ali wa
~ a l z u h u 'and
~ ~ other contemporary writers.

1.3.5. Their actions in Basra
When Talhah, az-Zuhayr, 'i'ishah and the people with them
arrived in Basra, they stopped beside a l - ~ h u r a ~ b a hFrom
. ' ~ ~ there,
they sent word to the prominent figures and nobles of the tribes,
seeking their help against the killers of 'Uthmh (&). Many of the
Muslims in Basra and elsewhere wanted to bring the murderers of
'Uthmin (&) to justice, but some of them thought that this was the
job of the caliph alone, and that going out on campaign for this
purpose without his instructions was wrong. Many of the people of
Basra, regardless of their different tribal backgrounds, joined them
because these were Companions whom the Prophet (@) had testified
were guaranteed paradise; they were members of the consultative
committee; they were accompanied by the Mother of the Believers
'kishah (I&),
the beloved of the Messenger of Allah
and the
..

(s)

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

most knowledgeable of all women; their quest was undoubtedly
legitimate; and no Companion denounced it.
Az-Zubayr sent a message to al-Abaf ibn Qays al-Sa'di atTameemi, asking for his support in seeking vengeance for the murder
of 'Uthmiin (&). Al-&naf was one of the leaders of Tameem, a
man whose word carried weight. He said, describing the seriousness
of the situation: "There came to me the most serious decision I was
ever faced with, and I said: 'If I let these people down when they have
the Mother of the Believers and the two disciples of the Messenger of
with them, it will be something very serious indeed.'"'"
Allah (g)
However, he decided to keep out of it, and he took with him six
thousand men who obeyed him, but many others disobeyed him with
regard to this matter and joined Talhah, az-Zubayr and the Mother of
the ~ e 1 i e v e r s . IAz-Zuhri
~~
stated that most of the people of Basra
followed them.'44 Ta&ah, az-Zubayr, 'kishah and their followers
were joined by new supporters of the cause for which they had come
out. Ibn Hunayf tried to calm things down and sort things out as
much as he could, but the matter was beyond his control, so much so
that one of them said concerning Basra: "Some of the people of Syria
have descended among us."145 Even Mu'iwiyah, later on, tried to
take over Basra with the help of its people.146
Some unreliable sources say that 'Uthmk ibn Hunayf allowed
Hukaym ibn Jablah to fight, but this is not proven, and the sound
sources do not confirm that.'"

After 'kishah had addressed the people of Basra, Hukaym ibn
Jablah came and started fighting. The companions of 'kishah,
Talhah and az-Zubayr brandished their spears at them, but they did
not engage in combat. They were hoping that the other side would

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

53

stop, but Hukaym and his gang continued fighting and did not stop.
Tawah and z-Zubayr refrained from fighting except to defend
themselves, while Hukaym was urging his horse on and charging at
them.148Despite that, 'kishah (%) was very keen to avoid all-out
fighting, so she ordered her companions to move to the right in order
to avoid the fighters. They remained like that until night fell.14y
7~

The next morning, Hukaym ibn Jablah, making noise and with
his spear in his hand, made his way to where 'pishah (&)and hex
companioi~swere. Whenever he passed a man or woman who
criticised him for slandering 'L'ishah(%J, he killed him or her.'''
At that point, the people of the tribe of 'Ahdul-Qays became angry
and said to Hukaym: "You did what you did yesterday, and you have
repeated it today. By Allah (&), we will not let you off until we bring
you to justice."
Then they went back and left him, and Hukaym ibn Jablah
continued on his way with those who had taken part in the murder of
'Uthmgn (&), accompanied by the thugs of different tribal
backgrounds. They realised that they could no longer stay in Basra,
so they all rallied behind him and engaged the army of 'pishah (%),
and fierce fighting took place.151 The caller of 'A'ishah (&)
continued calling out and urging them to stop fighting, but they
in~isted.''~'kishah (I$&) continued to say: "Do not fight anyone but
those who are fighting you." Hukaym did not pay any attention to the
caller; he continued to instigate the fighting. At this point, the nature
of these people who were fighting became clear to az-Zubayr and
Tab&, they realised that they would not refrain from committing
any crime, and that their aim was to provoke the fighting.
They said: "Praise be to Allah, who has brought together for us
the people of Basra who took part in the murder of 'Uthmk (&) so
that we may wreak revenge on them. 0 Allah, do not leave any of
them alive. Help us to bring them to justice today, and cause them all

I

to die." They strove hard in fighting and called out: "Whoever was
not one of the killers of 'Uthrn2n (&), let him stop fighting us, for
we are only seeking the killers of 'Uthmiin, and we will not initiate
fighting with anyone else." They fought fiercely,153and none of the
killers of 'Uthmk (&) among the people of Basra escaped, except
for one. The caller of az-Zubayr and Talhah called out: ''If you know
any one from your tribes who took part in murdering 'Uthm2n (&)
in Madinah, then bring him to
A group of these ignorant thugs - as 'kishah said - had
come to her house at dawn to kill her. They got as far as the door of
her room with the help of a guide, but Allah
protected her by
means of a group of Muslims who had surrounded her house. The
Muslims prevailed over them, then they paraded them about and
executed them.155

(a)

Az-Zubayr, Tabah and those who were with them managed to
gain control of Basra, hut they needed food and supplies because
several weeks had gone by, and no one had offered them hospitality.
The army of az-Zubayr went to the governor's palace and then to the
public treasury to get provisions for the army; 'Uthmin ibn Hunayf
was released and went to join 'Ali
Thus Tamah, az-Zubayr
and the Mother of the Believers gained control of Basra and killed a
large number of those who had taken part in the attack on Madinah,
some seventy men, including the most prominent leader of the rebels
of Basra, Hukaym ibn Jablah, who had been very keen to fight and
start the war.'''

1.3.7. The letters of 'kishah (%)
.~ to other regions
'kishah (I&,) was keen to explain what had really happened
during the fight with the people of Basra, so she wrote to the people
of Syria, Kufah and al-Yamhah, and the people of Madinah also,
telling them what they had done and how things had ended up.

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

55

Among the things that she wrote to the people of Syria was:
"We only set out to put an end to the turmoil and to establish the rule
of the Book of Allah (&). Once we achieve that, our campaign will
be over. The best of the people of Basra and their prominent figures
pledged their support for us, and their evil ones and thugs opposed us
and confronted us with weapons. Among the things they said was:
'We will take the Mother of the Believers as a hostage, as she is the
one who is enjoining them and urging them to adhere to the truth.'
The Muslims gave them oppomity (to reconsider) time after time,
then when there was no excuse left for them, the murderers of
'Uthmin (&) were fought. None of them escaped except for
Hurqoo~ihn Zuhayr, and Allah (%) will bring him to justice. We
urge you by Allah ( B )that you should cany out the same mission as
us, so that we and you may meet Allah (&) having done what is
expected of

1.3.8. Difference of opinion between
'UthmSn ibn Hunayf and the army
of 'kishah, az-Zubayr and Tabah
At-Tabari narrated from Abu Makhnaf from Yoosuf ihn
Yazeed that Sahl ihn Sa'd said: "When they caught 'Uthmh ihn
Hunayf, they sent A h k ihn 'Uthmh ibn 'Mh to 'A'ishah to
consult her as to what should be done with him, and she said: 'Kill
him.' A woman said to her: 'We adjure you by Allah, 0 Mother of
the Believers, concerning 'Uthm2n (ibn Hunayf) and the fact that he
was a Companion of the Messenger of Allah
She said: 'Bring
A h k back.' So they brought him back, and she said: 'Detain him,
and do not kill him.' He said: 'If I had known that you were caLling
me back for this reason, I would not have come back.' Majzshi' ibn
Mas'ood said to them: 'Beat him and pluck out the hair of his beard.'
So they gave him forty lashes and plucked out the hair of his beard

(s).'

56

and his head, and his eyebrows and eyelashes, and they detained
him."159 But the chain of narration of this repoa includes Abu
Makhnaf, who is an extremist, hate-filled, Riifidi Shia. This report
was not proven by any sound chain of narration that can be relied on.
The noble Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) are far
above doing such an abhorrent action.
What may he understood from the report of Sayf is that the
thugs were the ones who did that, and that Talhah and az-Zubayr
regarded it as abhorrent and unacceptable. They sent news of that to
'kishah (%),who said: "Release him, and let him go wherever he
wants."'60 This report contradicts the details mentioned by Abu
Makhnaf because it does not mention the command to kill him or
detain him, or the command to pluck out his facial hair. This report,
which is the sound one, was favoured by an-Nuwayri and Ibn
~ a t h e e r . ' ~ Adh-Dhahabi
'
stated that Majiishi' ibn Mas'ood was
killed before he entered the house of 'Uthmk ihn ~ u n a ~ fEven
. ' ~if~
we assume that Majishi' ibn Mas'ood was not killed, he was not in a
position of leadership to issue such in~tructions.'~~

1.4. Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tglib
sets out for Kufah
The Companions in Madinah did not approve of 'Ali's leaving
Madinah. That became clear when 'Ali (&) decided to march to
Syria, to visit its people and see what Mu'iiwiyah was thinking and
doing.164He thought that at that stage, Madinah no longer possessed
the advantages that other cities possessed, and he said: "Manpower
and wealth are in Iraq." 165 When Ahu Ayyoob al-Anski (&) found
out about this idea, he said to the caliph: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, stay
in this land, because it is the shield that can give protection, the place
to which the Messenger of Allah (@) migrated. In it is his grave and
his minbar, and it is the heart of l s l m . If the &abs show obedience

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

57

to you, you will be fine like the caliphs who came before you; if some
people cause trouble to you, then send their enemies against them. If
you are forced to leave, then you may leave, after exhausting all
possible means of staying." The caliph followed the advice of Abu
Ayyoob and decided to stay in Madinah and send governors to the
provinces. 166
A number of political developments then took place that
forced the caliph to leave Madinah, and he decided to head for Kufah
so that he could be close to the people of
While he was
preparing to leave, news reached him that 'A'ishah, Talhah and azZubayr had set out for ~ a s r a . ' ~He
' asked the people of Madinah to
mobilise and support him, but he encountered reluctance on the part
of some of the people of Madinah because of the presence of the
troublemakers in 'Ali's army and the way in which they were dealt
with. Many of the people of Madinah thought that the turmoil was
still going on, and that they should wait until things became clearer.
They said: "No, by Allah (g),
we do not know what to do. This
matter is not clear to us, so we are going to stay where we are until the
matter becomes clear to us." At-Tabari narrated that 'Ali (&) set out
with his army for the purpose of confronting the people of Syria, and
some of the people of Kufah and Basra went out with hi,a group of
seven hundred lightly mned men.169

There is a great deal of evidence that many of the people of
Madinah were reluctant to respond to 'Ali's call to go out on a
campaign, such as the speeches of the caliph in which he complained
about this reluctance.'70 Many of the Companions withdrew after the
murder of 'Uthmih (&), as is apparent. Some of the men who had
been present at Badr stayed in their houses after the murder of
'Uthmih (&) and never left until they went to their grave^."^ Abu
Humayd as-S2'idi al-Ansiki, who had been present at Badr,
expressed his sorrow at the murder of the caliph 'Uthmih (&) and

ii

58

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

said: "0 Allah, I promise You that I will not smile until I meet
YOU."'^^ They thought that leaving Madinah at that time would lead
to getting embroiled in the turmoil, the bad consequences of which,
they feared,'73 would cancel out what they had achieved in the past
of righteous deeds and jihad with the Messenger of Allah
What is mentioned above does not mean that none of the
Companions joined the caliph's campaign; there were some who
joined him, but they were few. Ash-Sha'bi said: "None of the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah
were present at the
Battle of the Camel except for 'Ali, 'Ammi%,Talhah and az-Zubayr;
if they prove that there was a fifth, then I am a liar." 175 According to
another report: "Whoever tells you that more than four of those who
were present at Badr were present at the Battle of the Camel, do not
believe him. 'Ali and 'Ammir were on one side, and T a a h and azZubayr were on the other."'76 According to another report: "No one
joined 'Ali when he marched to Basra apart from six of the people of
Badr; there was no ~eventh.""~

(s)

This is what is meant by the report mentioned above, which
referred only to those Companions who bad been at Badr. Whatever
the case, those of the An& who took part in the turmoil were few.
lbn Sireen and ash-Sba'bi said: "When the tnrmoil occurred in
Madinah, the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ( B )were more
than ten thousand, but those who got involved were no more than
twenty men. The battle between 'Ali and T a a h and az-Zubayr and
the battle of Siffeen were called fitnah."178
From the above, it is clear that the number of Companions who
went out with the caliph 'Ali to Basra were very few, and we cannot
be certain that they took part in the Battle of the Camel; even though
this battle was so fierce and so many events took place during it, the
sources do not mention the Companions who took part in it or say
that any of them were martyred or ~ 0 u n d e d .One
l ~ ~of the reports

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

59

says: "Some seven hundred lightly armed men of Kufah and Basra
went out with him."180 These reports seem to be more in line with
how things were developing at that time and more in harmony with
the course of events and with the attitude of the people of Madinah,
which varied between keeping away completely and reluctance to
take part in any events.lal

1.4.1. Advice of Abdullah ibn SalSm
to Amir al-M'mineen 'Ali (&)
Ahdullah ibn S d b , the companion of the Messenger of Allah
(g),
tried to make Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) change his mind
and not go out. He came to him when he had made preparations to
march &d expressed his fear for him. He told him not to go to Iraq,
saying: "I am afraid that you may be struck by the sword." He also
told him that if he left the minbar of the Messenger of Allah (g),
he
would never see it again. 'Ali (&) knew these things from the
Messenger of Allah -, and he said: "By Allah, the Messenger of
told me about that." The people of Basra and Kufah who
Allah
were with 'Ali (&) had reached such a level of audacity that they
said to him, "Let us kill him." Killing Muslims who stood in their
way or who could pose a danger to their lives with their words and
deeds had become something very easy, and they did not see
anything wrong with it. But 'Ali told them not to do that, saying:
"AbduUah ibn S a l k is a righteous man."182 What they said, and
their aggressive attitude, was indicative of their lack of piety and their
lack of respect towards the noble Companions, which the Messenger
of Allah (@)
->
had enjoined upon the people who came after him.

there. A number of Muslims, approximately two hundred, came to
him.lm4In ar-Rabdhah, his son al-Hasan came to him, weeping and
not hiding his sorrow and dismay at what had befallen the Muslims of
division and dissent. Al-Hasan said: "I told yon, but you did not listen
to me, and next you will be killed when you are alone with no one to
support you." 'Ali (&) said: "You are still nagging like a little
girl.'85 What is it that you told me to do and I did not listen to you?,
He said: "I told you on the day that 'Uthmin (4)
was besieged to
leave Madinah, so that if he was killed, you would not be there. Then
I told you on the day that he was killed not to accept the oath of
allegiance until the delegations from different regions and Arab tribes
had each sworn their allegiance. Then I told you, when these two men
did what they did, to stay at home until things settled down, so if any
evildoing took place, it would be at the hands of people other than
you, but you did not listen to me in any of that." 'Ali (&) said: "0
my son, as for you telling me to leave Madinah when 'UthmZn (&)
was surrounded, by Allah, we were surrounded as be was
surrounded. As for your telling me not to accept the oath of
allegiance until the allegiance of the regions came, this matter was
something to be decided by the people of Madinah, and we did not
want this decision to be made by others. As for what you said when
Talhah and az-Zubayr set out, that was demeaning to the people of
Islam. By Allah, I have continued to be saddened and aggrieved since
I was appointed, feeling helpless and not able to achieve anything I
should achieve. As for your saying that I should stay home, what
about my duties? Who do you want me to be? Do you want me to be
l i e the hyena that is surrounded, that is helpless and just yelping? If I
do not pay attention to my duties concerning this issue, who will take
care of that? Stop wonying about it, 0 my son."'86
'Ali's attitude concerning this matter was clear, and no one
could deter him from what he had decided to do. He (&) sent word

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

61

from ar-Rabdhah, urging the people of Kufah to mobilise and calling
upon them to support him. The two envoys were Muhammad ibn Abi
Bala q-Siddeeq and Muhammad ibn Ja'far, but tbey did not succeed
in their mission because Abu Moosa al-Asb'ari, 'Ali's governor in
Kufah, discouraged the people and told them not to go out and fight
in the turmoil. He told them what he had beard from the Messenger of
Allah (g),
warning against taking part in fitnah.la7 After that, 'Ali
(&) sent Hsshim ibn 'Utbah ibn Abi Waqqis, but he also failed in
his mission because of the influence of Abu Moosa on the people.'88

1.4.3. Request of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) from the oasis of Dhu Q2r for

support from the people of ~ u f a h " ~
'Ali (&,) and his army moved towards Dhu Q% and camped
there, eight days after leaving Madinah, with approximately nine
hundred men.Ig0At that time, he sent Abdullah ibn 'AbbL to Kufah,
but they did not respond to him. Next he sent 'Ammar ibn Yisir and
al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, and he dismissed Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, replacing
him with Qardhah
- ibn ~ a ' b . " ' Al-Qa'qB played a major role in
convincing the people of Kufah to join 'Ali. He addressed them and
said: "I am an adviser to you, and I care sincerely about you. I want
you to follow true guidance, and I shall tell yon something that is
true... There should be no alternative but to have a leadership to
organise the people's affairs, deter wrongdoers and support those
who are wronged. This is 'Ali (&) who has been appointed to a
position of leadership, and his message to the people is fair and just.
He is only calling people to that which is best and to set affairs
straight, so join him and be in the forefront of support."'92
Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali had a clear effect on the people. He stood up
and addressed them, saying: "0 people, respond to the call of your
leader. Join your brothers, because no doubt there will be many

people who will support him in this matter. By Allah, it is better that
this matter of leadership be taken care of by people of reason and
wisdom, both in the short- and long-term. Respond to our call, and
help us with regard to this crisis that we and you are going
Many of the people of Kufah responded, and between six and
seven thousand went out with 'Ammir and al-Hasan. They were
joined by two thousand men from Basra, from the tribe of 'AbdulQays. Then other tribes came to him until his m y , when the battle
began, was approximately twelve thousand strong.'94 When the
people of Kufah met Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali at Dhn Qir, he said to
them: "0 people of Kufah, you confronted the Persians and their
kings, you destroyed their armies and inherited what they left behind,
and you grew stronger against your enemies. I am calling you to join
us in order to deal with our brothers in Basra. Ifthey turn back, that is
what we want, but if they persist, we will try to deal with them on the
basis of kindness, and we will avoid confrontation unless they wrong
us first. We will never leave anything that could lead to putting things
straight and achieving something good, but we will prefer it over that
which could lead to evil, if Allah wills, and there is no strength except
with Allah (3g)."195

1.4.4. Difference of opinion should not
affect the love between people
This applies to the situation of the Companions during this
turmoil. Even though they had differences of opinion, none of them
developed any resentment against his brother. Let us read this story
about an incident that took place in Kufah:
Bukhari narrated that Abu W2il said: "Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari,
Abu Mas'ood and 'Uqbah ibn 'Amr al-An$& entered upon 'Amrnir
when 'Ali (&) sent him to the people of Kufah to urge them to join

i

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

63

him. They said: 'We have never seen anything from yon that we
dislike since yon became Muslim like your hastening to take sides in
this matter.' 'Amm% said: 'And I have never seen anything from you
that I dislike since you became Muslim like your reluctance in this
matter (supporting 'Ali)."' According to another report: Abu
Mas'ood, who was well off, said: "0 slave, bring me two suits and
give one to Ahu Moosa and one to 'Ammk." He said: "Wear it when
you go to the Friday prayer."196
Here we see Abu Mas'ood and 'Ammk, each thinking that the
other is wrong. Despite that, Abu Mas'ood gave 'Arnmk a suit to
wear for the Friday prayer because he was wearing travel clothes and
battle dress, and Ahu Mas'ood did not want him to have to attend the
Friday prayer wearing those clothes. This conduct is indicative of
deep friendship, even though they each regarded the other's attitude
towards the humoil as wrong. 'Ammk thought that Ahu Moosa and
Abu Mas'ood's reluctance to support 'Ali was wrong, and Abu
Moosa and Ahu Mas'ood thought that 'Ammir's haste to support
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was wrong. Each of them had an
argument of which he was convinced. Those who were reluctant to
support the caliph thought that it was right to refrain from taking part
in fighting in the event of fitnah, adhering to those hadiths
concerning this, which warned against taking up arms against fellow
Muslims. 'Amm2 had the same point of view as 'Ali (&) with
regard to fighting those who transgress the limits or commit outrages,
and he adhered to the words of Allah (%): -@hen fight you [all]
against the one that rebels) (Qur'an 49: 9). He interpreted the warning
against fighting as applying to those who were transgressing against
their brothers. Neither party wanted to kill the other, and both sides
would try to iind any reason to prevent fighting before it took place.
When fighting did occur, it occurred even though both parties were
reluctant to fight.197

1.4.5. Questions on the road
1.4.5.a. The questions asked by Abu Rifcah ibn
R X ' ibn Mslik al'Ajl2n al-An@ri when
'Ali wanted to leave ar-Rabdhah
Abu Rifi'ah said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, what do you want?
Where are you taking us?" 'Ali (*) said: "What we want is to set
things straight; if they accept that from us and respond, all well and
good." Abu RiE'ah said: "What if they do not respond?" 'Ali (&)
said: "We will leave them with the reason they have in their mind
(their own justification for their conduct) and acknowledge their right
to differ, and we will be patient." Abu RiE'ah said: 'What if they are
not content with that?" 'Ali
said: "We will leave them alone as
long as they leave us alone." Abu Rifi'ah said: "What if they do not
leave us alone?" 'Ali said: 'We will defend ourselves against them."
Ahu RiE'ah said: "Then yes (I will join you)."

(4)

He listened to that series of questions and answers, and his
mind was put at rest, so he said: "I shall impress you with my deeds
as you have pleased me with your words."198
1.4.5.b. The people of Kufah, including al-A'war
ibn B a d n al-Manqari, asked questions of 'Ali (&)
When the people of Kufah came to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) in Dhu Qik, some of them asked him the reason why he had

come; among those who asked these questions was al-A'war ibn
B a n k al-Manqari. 'Ali (&) said to him: "I am coming to put things
in order and extinguish the fire of enmity, in the hope that Allah
will bring this Umrnah together by means of us and prevent fighting.
If they respond to me, all well and good." Al-A'war said: "What if
they do not respond to us?" 'Ali (&) said: "We will leave them
alone as long as they leave us alone." Al-A'war said: "What if they
do not leave us alone?" 'Ali (&) said: "We will defend ourselves

against them." Al-A'war said: "Do they have the same rights and
duties as us?, He said: ' ' ~ e s . " ' ~ ~
1.4.5.c. Abu S a l h a h ad-Da'lini, one of those who
asked questions of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
Abu S a l h a h said: "Do you think these people have valid
grounds for their demand of vengeance for 'Uthmin, if they are
seeking Allah thereby?' 'Ali said: "Yes." Abu Salsmah said: "Is
there any valid reason for you to delay that (the seeking
vengeance)?" 'Ali (&)
, .,
said: "Yes. If there is something that cannot
be done, then the ruling concerning it should be based on precautions
and what is in the people's best interests." Abu S a l h a h said: "What
is our situation and theirs if we end up fighting tomorrow?" 'Ali
(&) said: "I hope that no one who is sincere towards Allah among
us or them will be killed except that Allah will admit him to
paradise."200

1.4.5.d. M2lik ibn Habeeb asked questions of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi TSlib (&>)
M2lik said: "What will you do if yon meet these people (in
battle)?"Ali (4)
said: "It has become clear to us and to them that
what is best is to refrain from that. If they give us allegiance, all well
and good, but if they and we insist on fighting, then there is nothing
we can do about it." M2lik said: "If we start fighting, what is the
situation of those among us who are slain?" 'Ali said: "Whoever is
sincere towards Allah will benefit from that, and it may he his
~alvation."~~'
The aim of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was to set things
straight and put an end to the fitnah. Fighting was not something that
he was considering; if it happened, it would be because he could not
help it. With regard to whoever was killed on either side, his ultimate
fate would depend on his intention, regardless of whether he fought

66

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

on 'Ali's side or against him. Thus Amir al-Mu'mineen continned
that the Muslims who went out for this purpose, after the martyrdom
of 'Uthmh (&), were seeking to set things straight and put an end
to turmoil, and their decision was based on sincerity. Their reward
would be commensurate with the sincerity of their intentions and the
purity of their hearts.202

1.5. Attempts at reconciliation
Before 'Ali (&) moved towards Basra with his army, he
stayed in Dhu Q2r for a few days. He tried, with all the powers and
means at his disposal, to put an end to this division and turmoil by
peaceful means and to spare the Muslims the evils of fighting and
armed confrontation. The same is also tme of Talhah and az-Zuhayr.
A number of the Companions and senior Tgbi'oon who had refrained
from getting involved also took part in the attempts to bring about
reconciliation, including:

1.5.1.'ImrSn ibn Hu~ayn(&)
He sent word to the people discouraging both parties (from
engaging in fighting). Then he sent word to Banu 'Adiyy, a large
group of whom had joined az-Zubayr. His envoy came and said to
them in their mosque: "I have been sent to you by 'Imrh ibn Husayn,
the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (g)
to advise you; he
swears by Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, that he would
rather be an Abyssinian slave with a cut-off nose, tending goats at the
top of a mountain until death comes to him, then to shoot an arrow
against either of these two parties, whether it misses or hits its target.
So refrain from fighting, may my father and mother he sacrificed for
you." The people said: "Leave us alone, for we will never abandon
the wife of the Messenger of Allah
for anything."203

1.5.2. Ka'b ibn Soor
He was one of the senior Tihi'oon. He did his utmost and
pushed himself beyond his limits, playing a role that many men
would be unable to play. He persisted in striving to bring about
reconciliation until the thing that he was trying to prevent happened.
He died as a victim of his efforts, slain as he stood between the two
armies calling each to put down their weapons and refer to the Book
of Allah (&) for judgement.'04

1.5.3. Al-Qa'q2 ibn 'Amr at-Tameemi
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) sent al-Qa'qi? ibn 'Amr atTameemi (&) on a mission of reconciliation to T m a h and azZubayr, instructing him: "Meet with these two men, call them to
brotherhood and unity and warn them of the seriousness of
differences and division." So al-Qa'q2 went to Basra, and he started
with 'A'ishah (r&). He said to her: 'What has brought you to Basra,
0 my mother?" She said to him: "0 my son, (we have come) for the
purpose of setting things straight among the people." Al-Qa'qi?
asked her to send word to Talhah and az-Zubayr asking them to
come, and he spoke to them in her presence.

and Talbh and az-Zubayr

When they came, he asked them why they had come, and they
said the same as 'A'ishah
bad said: "(We have come) forthe
purpose of setting things straight among the people." He said to
them: "Tell me, in what way are you going to set things straight? For
by Allah, if we agree with you, then we will join you in your efforts;
and if we disagree with you, we will not join you." They said: "The
murderers of 'Uthmsn (&) must be executed; if they are left alone
and are not punished in accordance with the Qur'an, this will he

forsaking the Qur'an and disregarding its rulings. If the prescribed
punishment is canied out on them, this will be keeping the Qur'an
alive." Al-Qa'q? said: "In Basra, there were six hundred of the
murderers of 'Uthmh, and you killed them all except one man,
namely Harqoos ibn Zuhayr as-Sa'di. When he fled from you, he
sought protection with his people of Banu Sa'd. When you wanted to
seize him from them and kill him, his people prevented you from
doing that; six thousand men got angry for his sake and deserted you
and stood against you as one. If you leave Harqoo~alone and do not
kill him, you will be abandoning your principles and what you are
calling others to and demanding 'Ali to do. But if you fight Banu
Sa'd because of Harqoos, and they overwhelm and defeat you, then
you will have come to the opposite of what you are trying to achieve;
you will have made them stronger, and you will be greatly harmed.
By going after Harqoos, yon are angering Rabee'ah and Mudar in
this land, as they have come together to fight you and defeat you in
support of Banu Sa'd. This is what happened with 'Ali and the
murderers of 'Uthmh who are in his army."
*:* The solution according to al-Qa'q3

He advocated deliberation and calming things down first, then
carrying out the prescribed punishment. The Mother of the Believers
and those who were with her were influenced by the logical argument
of al-Qa'q?. She said to him: "So what do you suggest, 0 Qa'q??"
He said: "I say that the best thing is to calm things down. It is
essential to give it time until the murderers of 'Uthmin are brought to
justice. Then when the division is ended, and the Ummah is united
behind Amir al-Mn'mineen, he will be free to deal with the killers of
'Uthmh. If you give your allegiance to 'Ali and support him, this
will be a good sign and a blessing, and 'Ali will be able to avenge
'Uthm2n. But if you refuse and continue to be stubborn and insist on
fighting, this will be a bad sign and will lead to the diminishing of

Muslim power. So be on the side of caution, and be the means of
good as you have always been; do not expose us to ruin, because that
will affect you too, and Allah (g)
may bring about our doom and
yours. By Allah, I say this and call you to it, and I am wonied lest we
do not reach any agreement before Allah ($) brings destruction
upon this Ummah, which has lost a great deal and been stricken by
calamity. What has befallen it is very serious; it is not like one man
killing another, or a group killing a man, or even a tribe killing a
tribe." They were convinced by the sincere and persuasive words of
al-Qa'ql and agreed to his call for reconciliation. They said to him:
"You have spoken well. Go back, and if 'Ali comes and tells us the
same as you have said, the matter will be settled inshallah." So alQ a ' q l went back to 'Ali in Dhu Q2r, having succeeded in his
mission, and told 'Ali about what had happened. 'Ali was pleased
with that, and the people were about to reach a peaceful conclusion,
regardless of who approved or disapproved.z05
+:* Good signs of a deal between the two parties

When al-Qa'q2 went back and told 'Ali what bad happened,
'Ali (&) sent two envoyszn6to 'kishah and Talhah and the people
who were with them, to verify what al-Qa'q2 ihn 'A& had said.
They came to 'Ali (&) and told him that they were stiU agreeing
with what al-Qa'q2 had said. So 'Ali set out and came to a halt near
them, and the members of various tribes on each side met with one
another, Mudar with Mudar, Rabee'ah with Rabee'ah, Yemenis with
Yemenis. None of them had any doubt that a peace deal was
imminent. They camped close to one another and went out to meet
one another, and they did not talk about anything except the peace
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ah (&) decided to move on, and he
announced his important decision: "I will leave tomorrow, so leave
and go back (meaning to Basra). No one should come with us
tomorrow who contributed to the murder of 'Uthmh in any way."2n8

1.6. The outbreak of fighting
1.6.1. The role of the Saba'is
in the outbreak of fighting
In the camp of 'Ali (&), there were some of those evildoers
and rebels who had killed 'Uthmzn (&). There were those who were
not known by name, those who were known but were protected by
their tribes, those concerning whom there was no evidence about
their role in the murder of 'Uthmin, and those who bad hypocrisy in
their hearts but were not able to show it openly.209The followers of
Ibn Saba' were eager to fan the flames of fitnah so that they could
avoid justice.210

When the people had settled down in their camps, 'Ali came
out, as did Talhah and az-Zubayr. They met and spoke about that
which they differed on, and they did not see anything better than
reconciling and giving up war when they saw that things were
becoming clearer. They parted on that note. 'Ali
returned to his
camp, and Talhah and az-Zubayr returned to theirs. Talhah and azZubayr sent word to the commanders of their m y , and 'Ali sent
word to the commanders of his army, apart from those who bad
besieged 'Uthmin (&).

The people went to sleep intending to reconcile and avoid
trouble, and they did not doubt that there would be a peace deal. Tbey

talking about or planning anythmg but reconciliation. Those who had
been behind the turmoil spent their worst night ever because they felt
that the end was looming for them. They spent the entire night in
discussion, and one of them said: "As for Tabah and az-Zubayr, we
know where they stand, but as for 'Ali, we did not know where he
stands until today. That was when he told the people to move on the
next day, hut none of those who had helped in the murder of 'Uthmk

in any way were to move with them. And, by Allah, the people's
view concerning us is the same; if they reconcile, then their
agreement will be to shed our blood."211 Ibn as-Sawda' Abdnllah ibn
Saba', who was the leader, spoke and said: "0 people, your
opportunity will be when the people (from both camps) are mixing;
show kindness to them, and when the people meet tomorrow, start
the fight and do not give them any time to think. The ones whom you
are with will have no option but to defend themselves. Allah will
distract 'Ali and Talhah and az-Zubayr, and those with them will be
distracted from that which you hate. So think about it and then
disperse without making the people suspicious about you. r r 2 1 2 So
they agreed to start the fight secretly.
The next morning, they came when it was still dark and their
neighbours were unaware of what they were doing. Those from
Mudar went to their counterparts from Mudar, those from Rabee'ah
went to their counterparts from Rabee'ah, those from Yemen went to
their counterparts among their fellow Yemenis. They attacked them,
and the people of Basra staaed fighting back, each group fighting
those who attacked them. Az-Zubayr, Tamah and some prominent
figures from Egypt came out and sent word to the right flank, who
were from Rabee'ah, led by 'Abdur-Ralpnk ibn al-Hikith ibn
Hishim, and the left flank, who were led by 'Abdur-Rahmsn ibn
'AGb ibn Usayd, while they remained steadfast in the core. They
said: 'What is this?" They said: "The people of Kufah attacked us
this night... We knew that 'Ali would not give up until he shed blood
and transgressed the sacred limits, and that he is not going to agree
with us." Then they retreated with the people of Basra, and the
people of Basra shot arrows at those who attacked them until they
pushed them back to their camp.213
'Ali (&) and the people of Kufah heard the noise. The
Saba'is had planted a man close to 'Ali
so that he could tell him

(a)

72

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

what they wanted him to hear. When he said: "What's going on?,"
that man said: "We have been taken by surprise. Some of them
attacked us at night, and we pushed them back." 'Ali (&)
. ., said to his
commander on the right flank: "Stay on the right flank," and he said
to his commander on the left flank: "Stay on the left flank." The
Saba'is continued their efforts to keep the battle raging.z14Despite
the way the battle began, the two sides did not rush to fight until they
found out what happened. 'Ali (&) and those who were with him all
agreed not to start fighting until the other side started, so as to
establish that they were the wrongdoers. Even if they engaged in
fighting, they agreed that they would not kill anyone who was
running away and would not finish off anyone who was wounded.
But the Saba'is were trying hard to instigate. the fighting.'15
On the other hand, Talhah, who was on his mount with the
people rushing around him, called out: "0 people, can you listen?"
But they continued to rush and did not listen to him. He did not say
any more than: "Woe to you, moths to the flame, and greed is killing
them!"z16 Were there any moths other than those Saba'is, and was
there any greed other than among them? Rather the attempts to bring
about reconciliation continued until the last moment of the battle.
From this discussion, the impact of Ibn Saba', and his helpers
the Saba'is, on the battle becomes clear. We can also see clearly,
beyond any shadow of a doubt, the keenness of the Companions
(&) to reconcile and unite. This is the truth which is confirmed by
the texts and of which one may feel certain.217
Before discussing the stages of the battle, we should point out
that the impact of the Saba'is in the Battle of the Camel is something
that all scholars agree upon, whether they called them the evildoers,
thugs of the two parties, the murderers of 'Uthmiin (&), the fools or
hooligans, or they referred to them clearly as ~ a b a ' i s . ~ "The
following are some texts that confirm this:

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

73

(a) It says in Akhbtir al-Bayah, by 'Umar ibn Shubbah, that those to
whom the murder of 'Uthmh (&)
. . was attributed were afraid that
the two parties might reconcile and agree to kill them, so they started
the fight between them and there happened what happened.219
(b) Imam at-Tahhawi said: "The fitnah of the camel broke out against
the wishes of both 'Ali and Talhah, rather it was stirred up by the
wrongdoers against the wishes of the a f o r e m e n t i ~ n e d . " ~ ~ ~

(c) Al-Bgqillhi said: "A deal was reached, and they parted when
both groups were content with the deal, but the killers of 'Uthmin
(&) were afraid that they would be caught and brought to justice. So
they got together and discussed the matter, and they different
concerning it; then they agreed to split into two groups and start the
fight at dawn in both camps, when they were scattered throughout the
camps. The group in 'Ali's camp would shout out: 'Talhah and azZubayr have betrayed us!', and the group in the camp of Talhah and
az-Zubayr would shout out: "Ali has betrayed us!' They succeeded in
theu plan, and fighting broke out. Each of the two parties was
limiting itself to defending itself and hying not to let the bloodshed
go beyond that. This is the correct approach on the part of both
parties, showing restraint for the sake of Allah (&) as fighting broke
out and they had to defend themselves. This is what happened
according to the sound reports, and this is what we believe."221
(d) A-Q2di 'AbdulLJabb2r narrated the views of the scholars, which
is that 'Ali, Talhah, az-Zubayr and 'A'ishah reached a peace deal and
agreed to avoid war and to defer dealing with the issue (of 'Uthmh's
murderers). Those of the enemies of 'Uthmh (&) who were in the
camp did not Wte that, and they were afraid that the Muslims would
focus their efforts on dealing with them, so they planned to disrupt
that, as is well known, and that was achieved.22z
(e) Al-Qi& Abu Bakr ibn alLCArabisaid: "'Ali came to Basra, and the
two groups came together to talk, but the people of whims and desires

74

f i e Battles of the Camel and S i f f e e ~
and the issue of arbitration

did not leave them alone; they hastened to shed blood, and war broke
out. There were a large number of thugs who decided to start the fight
so that the murderers of 'Uthmh (&) would not be brought to
justice. One person in the army could spoil its plans, so what if there
were one thousand?"z23
(f) Ibn Hazm said: 'The evidence for that is that the two armies drew
close together and no fighting broke out, but when night came, the
murderers of 'Uthmh (&) realised that any agreement reached by
the two parties would be against them. They attacked the camp of
T a a h and az-Zubayr at night, wielding the sword against them. The
people had to defend themselves, so they pushed them back until they
reached the camp of 'Ali (&). Then 'Ali's people had to defend
themselves, each group no doubt thinking that the other had initiated
the fighting. There was a great deal of confusion, but no one went
beyond defending himself. The evildoers and killers of 'Uthrnh
(&) persisted in their attempts to make the fighting continue, and
each group thought that it was doing the right thing in defending
itself. T a a h was hit by a stray arrow while he was standing, not
knowing what was happening. The arrow sbuck a wound in his lower
leg, which he had received at Uhud while defending the Messenger
of Allah (@). He left the battlefield and died soon after (&). AzZubayr (&)left while the battle raged; he was killed after he had
withdrawn from the battle, in Wadi al-Sib$', which is less than a
day's march from Basra. That is what happened."zz4
Adh-Dhahabi said: "The Battle of the Camel was stirred up by the
foolish among the two
He also said: "The two groups had
reconciled, and neither 'Ali nor
intended to fight; rather their
intention was to bring about unity. But the thugs of the two parties
traded arrows, and fighting broke out and engulfed everyone."226

In the book Duwal al-Islam it says: "Fighting broke out because of the
thugs, and 'Ali, Tabah and az-Zubayr were no longer in control."zz7

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

75

Dr. Sulayman ibn Hamad d-'Awdah said: "We may say that
the report of aflahari, which speaks of the Saba'i role in the Battle of
the Camel, is referring to the same people who are described as thugs
in other reports. Even if these thuggish groups, which are referred to
in other reports, did not have a direct connection to the Saba'is or
share the same aims and goals, it is possible that these thuggish
groups became the element that Ihn Saba' and his helpers took
advantage of, which is usually the case in some demagogic
movements that may be taken advantage of by some evildoers."228
We should not forget that the atmosphere of turmoil played a
major role in these events. There can be no doubt that at times of
chaos, people may not be able to see things that others can see very
clearly. They may have their own justification for doing things while
others can clearly see the reality of what they are doing, without any
effort. The darkness of turmoil is sufficient to prevent a person from
thinking carefully and seeing clearly.229For example, we may note
that d-Alpaf ibn Qays, who is one of those who lived through the
events of this battle, went out with the aim of joining 'Ali ibn Abi
Taib (&), but he was met by Abn Bakrah, who said: "0 a n a f , go
back, for I heard the Prophet (g)say: 'If two Muslims face one
another with swords, then the slayer and the slain will be in hell.' I
said - or it was said: '0 Messenger of Allah, as for the slayer @IS
case is clear), but what about the one who was slain?' He said: 'He
wanted to kill his companion."'230
Fighting alongside 'Ali (&) was right and correct, and
whoever was killed fighting alongside him is a martyr and will have
two rewards. However, Abu Bakrah (&) was quoting a hadith that
was mentioned in a different context to'that in which 'ALi (&) was
fighting those who were transgressing. This was his own
understanding, hut it was not appropriate in 'Ali's case. From this
report, we understand that 'Ali (&) faced many obstacles when he

fought others, including fatwas like these, which reflect piety more
than the correct fatwa issued for the correct situation.231Al-Ahnaf
refused to join 'ALi (&), so he was not present with either side in the
Battle of the

figures in the battle, explains to us more about the reality of the
matter: "This is the fitnah that we were told about." His freed slave
said to him: "Are you calling it fitnah when you are fighting in it?"
Az-Zubayr said: '.Woe to you! Sometimes we see clearly, and
sometimes we do not see clearly. There was no matter in which I was
uncertain where 1 stood except this matter, for I do not know whether
I should go ahead or give up."233 Talhah also referred to that when he
said: "We used to be one against others, but now we are like two
mountains of iron, each seeking out the other."234
On the other hand, the companions of 'Ali (&) also
confirmed that there wav fitnah. 'Ammir (&)
said in Kufah,
,.
regarding 'kishah's coming out on the campaign: "By Allah, she is
the wife of your Prophet in this world and in the hereafter but Allah,
may He be blessed and exalted, is testing you by means of her."235

1.6.2. The first round of the Battle of the Camel
The Saba'is intensified their efforts to stir up fighting,
attacking the other side and inciting each side against the other. A
tough battle broke out, which was the Battle of the Camel. It is called
that because the Mother of the Believers 'kishah (I$$+) was in the
midst of the army of Basra during the second round, riding a camel
that had been given to her in Makkah by Ya'la ibn Umayyah, who
had brought it from Yemen. She set out on this camel from Makkah
to Basra, then she rode it during the battle.
The battle took place on Friday, 16 Jumiida ath-Thiiniyah 36
AH, in an area called az-Ziibooqah, near Basra. 'Ali was upset about

I

'A6i ibn Abi Trilb

77

what happened, and his caller called out: "Stop fighting, 0 people!"
But no one listened; everyone was busy fighting his opponent.236
There were two rounds in the Battle of the Camel; in the first round,
the two commanders of the army of Basra were Talhah and azZnbayr, and this round lasted from dawn until just before
'Ali (&) called out to his army, as T a a h and az-Zubayr called out
to theirs: "Do not kill anyone who wants to flee, do not finish off
anyone who is wounded, and do not chase anyone who is leaving the
battlefield and giving up the fight."238
Az-Zuhayr (&) asked his son AbduUah to pay off his debts
and said: "No one is killed today except the wrongdoer or one who is
wronged, and I think that I will be killed wrongfully; what I am most
wonied about is my
At that point, a man came to az-Zubayr
and offered to kill 'Ali (&) by infiltrating his army and then killing
him. Az-Zubayr objected strongly to that and said: "No, no believer
should kill a believer, for faith protects a believer from killing."240
Az-Zubayr had no desire to kill 'Ali or anyone else who was innocent
of the murder of 'Uthmin (&). Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali called azZubayr (&) and spoke to him kindly and gently. It was said that he
reminded him of a hadith that he had heard from the Messenger of
Allah (g),
who had told az-Zubayr: "You are going to fight him
('Ali) & l a ~ f n l l ~ . " This
' ~ ~ hadith has no sound chain of narration,
though.%'
Some reports explain that the reason why az-Zuhayr left just
before the battle was because he realised that 'Ammkibn Ykir (&)
was on the other side. Even though he did not narrate from the
Messenger of AUah (B)the hadith: " 'Ammik will be killed by the
group that is in the
he may have heard it from other
Companions, because it was very well known.244Some reports give
as the reason for his leaving his doubt as to whether his stance
towards this turmoil (fitnah, as he called it) was correct.245According

i

!

78

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue o f arbitration

to another report that suggests his reason for leaving, Ibn 'Abbh
(&) reminded him of his blood ties with 'Ali (&) by saying: "How
would Satiyyah hint 'Abdul-MutJalib feel if you fought 'Ali ibn Abi
T a b ibn 'Abdul-Mumib with your
Whatever the
reasons, az-Zubayr left the battlefield and was met by Ibn Jarmooz,
who killed him,Z47as we shall see in detail below.
Az-Zubayr (&) was aware of his goal, which was to set
things straight, but wben he saw that fighting bad broken out instead
of peace, he left and did not fight. The words of Ibn 'Abbis, "Will
you fight 'Ali ibn Abi T Z b with your sword?", imply an unspoken
question: 'or have you come to set things straight and bring
unity?'"8 As a result of this conversation, az-Zubayr left the
battlefield and departed. Perhaps numerous, interconnected factors
played a role in his decision to abandon the battlefield.
As for Talhah ibn 'Ubaydull2h (&), az-Zubayr's second-iucommand of the army of Basra, he was wounded at the beginning of
the battle when be was struck by a stray arrow. It is not h o w n who
shot it, but it was a direct hit and caused him to bleed heavily. His
soldiers said to h i : "0Abu Muhammad, you are wounded. Go in
among their houses so that you can be treated." Talhah said to his
slave: "Carry me, and look for a suitable place for me." He entered
Basra and was placed in a house there to be treated, but his wound
continued to Meed until he died in that house. Then he was buried in
Basra (&).249
As for the report indicating that ai-Zubayr and Talhah (may
AUah be pleased with them) urged the people to cany on fighting,
and that ai-Zubayr only left the battlefield wben he saw that tbe
people of Basra were going to be defeated, this report is not sound.z50
It is contradicted by that which is proven of the dignity and sound
character of the Companions (&). It is also contrary to the sound
reports stating that the army of the Camel only went out to set things

i

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

79

straight and bring about reconciliation. How could this alleged action
of az-Zubayr (&) be in harmony with the aim for which he left
Makkah and went to Basra, namely to set things straight among the
people? In fact, the attitude of az-Zubayr (&) was one of keenness
to set things straight up to the very last moment. A l - H h , via Abu
Harb ibn Abil-Aswad ad-Du'ali, narrated that az-Zubayr (&) strove
to bring about reconciliation between the sides, but when the battle
began and chaos prevailed, az-Zubayr left the battlefie~d,'~'as did
T a a h . He had come to set things straight, not to shed blood. With
regard to the killing of T a a h (&), that occurred at the beginning of
the battle, as was clearly stated by al-Ahnaf ibn ~ a ~ s . * ' '
Az-Zubayr departed the battlefield, and Tabah died (may
Allah be pleased with them both). With the fall of the slain and
wounded, the first round of the Battle of the Camel ended, and the
army of 'Ali (4)
had prevailed. 'Ali (4)
had been following the
progress of the battle and saw the slain and wounded on both sides;
he was distressed and saddened by that. He went to his son al-Hasan
and embraced him. 'Ali
began weeping and saying to him: "0
my son, would that your father had died twenty years before this
day." Al-Hasan said: "0 my father, I warned yon about this." 'Ali
(&) said: "I did not think that it would go this far. What good is life
after this? What good can be hoped for after this?"253

(4)

1.6.3. The second round of the Battle of the Camel
News reached the Mother of the Believers 'A'ishah (!&,I of the
fighting that had taken place. She came out on her camel, surrounded
by the Azdi tribes and accompanied by Ka'h ibn Soor, to whom she
had given a mushaf to use to call the people to stop fighting. The
Mother of the Believers advanced. She hoped that people would
listen to her because of her status in their hearts, and that she would
be able to stop them fighting one another and stop the fitnah that had

80

The Battles offhe Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

begun to spread.254 Ka'b held up the mushaf and went before the
army of Basra, calling to the army of 'Ali (&I,
saying: "0 people, I
am Ka'h ibn Soor, the judge of Basra; I call you to the Book of Allah,
to act upon it and bring about reconciliation on that basis." The
Saba'is, who were in the forefront of the army of 'Ali (&), were
afraid that Ka'b's effort would succeed, so they targeted him with
their arrows as one man, and he died with the mu~hafin his hand.255
The arrows of the Saba'is also struck the camel and
of 'kishah (I&,), and she started calling out: "0 my sons, Allah,
Allah, rememder Allah and the Day of Reckoning, and refrain from
fighting!" The Saba'is did not respond to her; they continued striking
the army of Basra. 'Ali (&) was in the rear, ordering his troops to
refrain from fighting and not to attack the Basrans, but the Saba'is in
the forefront of his army did not respond to him; they persisted in
advancing, attacking and fighting. When 'kishah saw that they were
not responding to her call and saw Ka'b ibn Soor killed in front of
her, she said: "0 people, curse the killers of 'Uthmh and their
supporters." 'kishah (%) began to pray against the murderers of
' U t h i n (&) and to curse them, and the people of Basra raised their
voices in supplication against the murderers of 'Uthmin (&) and
their supporters, and they cursed them. 'Ali (&) heard the
supplication coming in loud voices from the army of Basra and
asked: "What is this?" They said: "It is 'A'ishah (t&J praying against
the murderers of 'Uthmk (&) and the people praying with her."
'Ali (&) said: "Pray with me against the murderers of 'Uthmgn
(&) and their supporters, and curse them." So the army of 'Ali (&)
raised their voices, cursing the murderers of 'Uthmk (&) and
praying against them.z57 'Ali (&) said: "0 Allah, curse the killers of
'Uthmk in the plains and in the mountains."258
The fighting intensified and spread. The people fought with
spears until the spears
then they unsheathed their swords

1

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

81

and fought until the swords broke, and finally they fought at close
quaaers.260 The Saba'is directed their efforts towards hamstringing
the camel and killing 'A'ishah (I$&), the Mother of the Believers, so
the m y of Basramshed to protect ' ~ i s h a (%)
h and her camel. They
fought to defend the camel, and they killed anyone who grabbed its
reins. The battle raging in front of the camel was so fierce and violent
that the howdah began to resemble a hedgehog because of all the
arrows that bad been shot at itz6'Many Muslims from the tribes of alAzd and Banu Dabbah and young men of Quraysh were killed around
the camel, after displaying unparalleled bravery and courage.262
'A'ishah (&) was very upset and frustrated. She had not
wanted any fight&, but fighting broke out despite her wishes, and
she ended up in the midst of the chaos, calling out for it to stop, but to
no avail. Everyone who took hold of the camel's reins was killed,
then Muhammad ibn Tabah (as-Sajjiid) came and took hold of the
reins, and he said to his mother the Mother of the Believers: "0 my
mother, what do you want me to do?" She said: "Be like the better of
the two sons of Adam," meaning that he should refrain from fighting.
He sheathed his sword, after having unsheathed it, and he was killed,
may Allah have mercy on him.263
Also killed was 'Abdur-R&mh ibn 'Itib ibn Usayd, who
tried to kill al-Ashtar even if it meant that he died too. He wrestled
him, and they both fell to the ground. 'Abdur-Rahmh ibn 'Itiib said
to those who were around him: "Kill me and ~ g l i k , " 'because
~~
of
his hatred for him due to the prominent role he had played in inciting
the people against 'Uthrnin (&). But the people did not know alAsbtar as 'Milk', and his time had not yet come. If 'Abdur-R&mh
had said 'al-Ashtar', many swords would have stnrck a l - ~ s h t a r . ~ ~ ~
As for Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, he fought in an unparalleled
fashion, throwing himself among the swords. He was taken from
among the slain with forty-odd wounds, the most severe and last of

1

82

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue o f arbitration

which was inflicted by al-Ashtar. Due to the latter's hatred for Ibn azZubayr, he did not sit on his horse when he hit him; rather he stood up
in the stimps and struck Ibn az-Zubayr on the head, thinking that he
had killed him.266A large number of people were also killed from the
tribes of Banu 'Adiyy, Banu Dabbah and al-Azd. Banu Dabbah
showed a great deal of courage and sacrifice for the Mother of the
Believers.
Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali (&), by virtue of the wisdom,
strength and militaq skill with which he had been blessed, realised
that as long as the camel remained on the battlefield, the fighting
would continue and a large number of people would be killed. The
people of the camel would not be defeated or give up fighting as long
as the Mother of the Believers remained on the battlefield. Her
staying on the battlefield also posed a danger to her life; the howdah
in which she was sitting was bristling with arrowslike ahedgehog.267
'Ali (&) ordered some of his troops, including Maammad
ibn Abi Bakr, the brother of the Mother of the Believers, and
Abdullah ibn Badeel, to hamstring the camel and take 'Ai\'ishah(I&,)
out of the howdah and to the ground; in other words, they wereto
sbike the camel's feet with their ~words.2~'
Her brother Muhammad
and Abdullah ibn Badeel carried her howdah and placed it in front of
'Ali (&), who ordered that she be taken into the house of Abdullah
ibn ~ a d e e l . 2'Ali's
~~
intuition proved to be correct; as soon
as Mother of the Believers left the battlefield, the motive that was
making the people of Basra eager to fight to the death disappeared,
and they turned and fled. If he had not taken this step, the battle
would have continued until the entire army of Basra, which was
defending the camel, had been destroyed or the army of 'Ali (&)
had been defeated.
When the rout began, 'Ali(&) or his caller shouted out to his
army, telling them not to pursue anyone who was running away, not

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

83

to finish off anyone who was wounded, and not to take any booty
except for equipment or weapons that had been brought to the
battlefield or the camp only; they were not to take anything more than
that. He also forbade them to enter the houses. Not only that; 'Ali
(&) also said to the people of Basra who had fought him that if any
of them found any of his property with one of 'Ali's companions, he
had the right to take it back. A man found a group from 'Alis army
cooking some meat in a pot that belonged to him. He took the pot
from them and threw away the meat that was in it, out of spite?70

1.6.4. The number of people killed
This intense battle led to a large number of people being killed,
but there are differing
as to the actual numbers. Al-Mas'oodi
-reports
.
said that these differences were due to the bias of the narrators."'
Qatgdah stated that the number of people killed at the Battle of
the Camel was twenty thou~and."~It seems that this is greatly
exaggerated, because the number of the two armies put together was
close to this or less. The RZ& Shia Abu Makhnaf exaggerated
greatly because of his bias, and he did wrong when he thought that he
was doing right. He said that the twenty thousand were from among
the people of ~asra."~Sayf stated that the number was ten thousand,
half from among the companions of 'Ali (&) and half from among
the companions of 'kishah (%). According to another report, he
said: "It was said that the number was ffteen thousand: five thousand
from among the people of Kufah and ten thousand from among the
people of Basra; half of them were killed during the first battle and
half during the second
But these two reports are weak
because of the intemptions in their chains of narration and other
faults; they are also grossly overstated. 'Umar ibn Shaybah
mentioned, with his chain of narration, that the number of slain was
more than six thousand, but this report is also weak in its chain of

84

The Battles ofthe Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

narration.z75 Al-Ya'qoobi exaggerated fuaher and gave a higher
figure; he put the number of slain at thirty-two thousand.276 This
figure is highly inflated, the reasons for this overstatement include
the following:
(a)

The desire of the enemies of the Companions, namely the
Saba'is and their followers, to deepen the dispute and division
among the members of the Ummah who are united by the love
of the Companions and who are following their example, after
that of the Messenger of Allah (g).

(b)

The contribution of some poets and ignorant people from
numerous tribes to inflating and magnifying the number, so as
to match the poetry that they attributed to some of their leaders
and knights. In addition to that, the storytellers wanted to
attract people's attention with the exciting events of which
they spoke.

(c)

The building of confidence for the followers of the thugs and
Saba'is in order to prove the success of their plans and
arrangements.277

As for the true number of people slain in the Battle of the
Camel, it is probably very small, for the following reasons:
*:*

The short duration of the fight. Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated
with a sound chain of narrationz78that the combat started
in the afternoon and that by the time the sun set, no one
who had been defending the camel was still there.

*:*

The defensive nature of the fighting, since each side was
merely defending itself and doing no more than that.

*

The hue number of those slain at the Battle of the Camel is
regarded as very low in comparison to the number of
Muslim martyrs at the Battle of Yannook (3,000) and the

'Ali ibn Abi TZlib

85

Battle of Qiidisiyyah (8,500), and those were battles that
went on for a number of days. This is also taking into
account the ferocity and intensity of those other battles,
which were decisive battles in the history of nations.
*:

Khaleefah ibn Khayyiit narrated a list of those among the
slain of the Battle of the Camel whose names were known;
there were approximately one hundred names.279 If we
assume that the total number was double that, this would
mean that the number of people slain at the Battle of the
Camel was no more than two hundred. This is what Dr.
Khaid ihn Muhammad al-Ghayth suggests is most likely,
in his dissertation Istishhcid 'Uthmcinwa Waq'at at-Jamal
fi Marwiyit Sayf ibn 'Urnar fi Tareekh at-Tabari Dirisah Naqdiyyah (The martyrdom of 'Uthmin and the
Battle of the Camel in the reports of Sayf ibn 'Umar in

1.6.5. Is it hue that MarwSn ibn al-Hakam
killed Talhah ibn 'Ubaydull2h?
Many reports indicate that the killer of Talhah ibn 'Ubaydull3h
(&) was Marwin ibn a l - ~ a k a m ? ~However,
'
if one studies these

reports, it becomes clear that Marw2n ibn al-Hakam is innocent of
this accusation for the following reasons:
(a)

Ibn Katheer said: "It was said that the one who shot this arrow
was Marwin ibn al-Hakam, and it was said that the one who
shot this arrow was someone else. In my view, the latter is
more likely, even though the former is a well-known view.
And Allah (%) knows best.''2a2

01)

Ibn al-'Arabi said: "They said that Marwin killed Talhah ibn
'Ubaydullih, hut how can anyone know that except the One

86

The Battles ofthe Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

Who knows the unseen? It was not narrated by anyone
trustworthy."z83
(c)

Mubibb ad-Deen al-Khateeb said: "This report about T a a h
and Marwin is a mystery; no one knows where it came
from."284

(d)

The reason given for Marwh's desire to kill Talhah (&) that M m h accused Talhah of helping in the murder of
'Uthmh (&) - is invalid. There is no proof by any sound
chain of narration that any of the Companions helped in the
murder of 'Uthmh (&).

(e)

At the Battle of the Camel, MarwZn and T a a h were both on
the same side, which was the side of those who were calling
for putting things right among the people.285

(f)

Mu'Zwiyah (&) appointed M a n v h in charge of Madinah
and Makkah. 1f it were true that Marwh had done this,
Mu'Zwiyah would not have put him in charge of the Muslims
in the places that are most sacred before Allah (B).

(g)

There is a report from M m Z n ibn al-Hakarn in Saheeh al~ u k h i i r i Bukhari
. ~ ~ ~ is known for being very thorough and
careful in accepting reports; if it were true that M m h killed
Tabah (&), that would have been sufficient reason to reject
his reports and question his character.287

1.6.6. The call of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) after the battle
As soon as the battle started to die down, the caller of 'Ali
(&) cried out: "Do not finish off anyone who is wounded, do not
pursue anyone who is fleeing, do not enter any house. Whoever lays
down his weapon is safe, and whoever locks his door is safe." His
army had no right to any booty except what had been brought onto

Xli ibn Abi Tilib

87

the battlefield of weapons and mounts, and nothing beyond that. The
caller of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) informed those who had
fought him of the people of Basra that if one of them found any of his
property with 'Ali's troops, he could take it back.'"
Some people thought that the army of 'Ali (&) was going to
distribute the female captives among themselves, so they spoke about
that and spread that notion among the people. 'Ali (&) soon
surprised them when he announced: "You have no right to any
female captive, and the estates are to be divided according to the laws
of Allah (s).
Any woman whose husband has been killed must
observe 'iddah of four months and ten days." They objected to that,
asking: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, is their blood permissible for us and
not their women?" 'Ali (&) said: "This is the right approach when
fighting people of the qiblah (fellow Muslims)." Then he said:
"Bring your mows and draw lots concerning 'kishah ($), for she
is the one who was leading these people!" They were shbcked and
said: "We ask Allah for forgiveness." It had now become clear to
them that what they were saying and thinking was very wrong. In
order to please them, though, 'Ali (&) gave each of them five
hundred from the public

1.6.7. Checking on the slain and praying
for mercy for them
After the battle ended, 'Ali (4)
went out with a group of his
companions to check on the slain. He saw Muhammad ibn Tabah
(as-Sajjsd) and said: "Znna Lillihi wa inna ilayhi r6ji'oon (Verily, to
Allah we belong
- and unto Him is our return). By Allah, he was a
righteous young man." Then he sat down sorrowfully and prayed for
forgiveness and mercy for the slain, and he spoke highly of them.290
After that, he went back to his house and saw his wife and two
daughters weeping for 'Uthmh (&) and his relatives and for az-

88

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

Zubayr, T a b a h and others among their Qurayshi relatives. It was
narrated that he said to them: "I hope we will be among those of
whom AUah (&) says: $And We shall remove from their breasts any
deep feeling of bitterness [that they may have]. [So they will be like]
brothers facing each other on thrones.) (Qur'an 15: 47)." Then be
said: "Who are they if not us? Who are they if not us?" And he kept
repeating it until the narrator wished that he would fall silent.291

1.6.8. The allegiance of the people of Basra
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
. . was very keen to unite the
people, to respect the people under his authority and to treat them
honourably. This treatment had a far reaching effect by convincing
the people of Basra to swear allegiance to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(A).In the evening following the Battle of the Camel, he put the
captives in a special place. When he prayed the dawn prayer, he
asked for Moosa ibn Ta&ah ibn 'Ubaydulliih. He brought him close,
welcomed him and seated him next to him, and asked him how he
and his brothers were. Then he told him: "We did not seize your land
because we want to take it away from you; we seized it lest the people
plunder it." He gave him the harvest of the land and said: "0son of
my brother, if you have any need, come to us." He did the same with
his brother 'Irnr2n ibn Tabab, and the two brothers swore allegiance
to him. When the other captives saw that, they entered upon 'Ali
(&) to swear allegiance to him, and he accepted their allegiance. He
accepted allegiance from each tribe, one by one.z9z
He also asked about M a r w b ibn al-Hakam, saying: "There is
compassion for him because of blood ties; in addition to that, he is
one of the noble young men of Quraysh." Marwin sent word to alHasan, al-Husayn and Ibn 'AbbL asking them to speak to 'Ali on his
behalf. 'Ali said: "He is safe. Let him go wherever he wants."
Because of this generous and noble treatment, Marwin did not want

I

Xli ibn Abi Ttlib

89

to leave until he had sworn allegiance to 'Ali (&).293 Marwh (&)
praised the actions of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), telling his son
al-Hasan: "I have never seen anyone more generous in victory than
your father. As soon as we began to flee on the day of the Camel, his
caller called out: 'Do not finish off anyone who is wounded, do not
pursue anyone who is fleeing."'294
Thus the people of Basra swore allegiance to Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&). He appointed his nephew Abdullah ibn
'Abbis (&) as their governor and Ziyid ibn Abeebi in charge of the
land tax. 'Ali (&) wanted to stay there longer, but he hastened to
leave because of M2ik (&Ashtar). Al-Ashtar had been hoping to
become governor of Basra; when he found out that Ibn 'Abbis had
been appointed to the post, he became angry and left with his people.
'Ali (&)
.. was afraid that he might cause trouble, so he went quickly
with the remainder of his army and caught up with him. 'Ali (&)
reprimanded for leaving, but be pretended that he had not heard
anything else about him.z95

1.6.9. The hadith of Abu Bakrah from the
"If two Muslims
Messenger of Allah (g):
face one another with swords, then the
slayer and the slain will be in hell7,296
Al-Qurtubi said: "Our scholars said that this hadith, the hadith
of Abu Bakrah, is not speaking about the Companions of the Prophet
(g)
because Allah (&) says: 4If two parties among the Believers fall
into a quarrel, make ye peace between them: but if one of them
transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then fight ye [all]
against the one that transgresses until it complies with the command
of Allah, but if it complies, then make peace between them with
justice, and be fair: for Allah loves those who are fair [and just]. The
Believers are but a single Brotherhood: So make peace and

90

The Battles of the Camel and Sgeen, and the issue of arbitration

reconciliation between your two [contending] brothers: And fear
Allah that ye may receive Mercy$ (Qur'an 49: 9-10).

(a)

"Allah
enjoined fighting the group that is in the wrong. If
the Muslims fail to fight the group that is in the wrong, then one of
the obligations enjoined by Allah ( B )will have been abandoned.
This proves that the words of the Prophet (@), 'The slayer and the
slain will be in hell,' are not about the Companions of the Prophet
(g),
because they only fought because of a misunderstanding." AlQnrpbi also said: "If what is required of Muslims, in the case of any
difference between two groups of Muslims, is t o m away from it and
stay in their houses and break their swords, then no hadd
punishments would be carried out and no falsehood would be
confronted. Then the hypocrites and evildoers would find it easy to
violate all sacred limits, confiscate the Muslims' wealth, take their
women captive and shed their blood, because they would gang up
against them, and the Muslims would refrain from confronting them
by saying: 'This is fitnah. We are forbiddento fight in this case; we
are instructed to be passive and run away from it. ,,,297
An-Nawawi said: "With regard to the slayer and the slain
being in hell, this applies to cases where there is no (Sharia)
justification, when they are fighting for tribal reasons and the like.
Moreover, what is meant by hell is that they deserve it and may he
punished therein or may be pardoned by Allah (&). This 1s the
correct view. One may judge or evaluate any incident of fighting
between Muslims on this basis, but it should be noted that the blood
that was shed among the Companions (may Allah be pleased with
them all) is not included in this waming. According to the view of
Ah1 as-Sunnah, which is the correct view, we should think positively
of them and refrain from debating about the disputes among them.
We should understand their fighting on the basis that they had what
they thought was a valid reason for it. They did not intend to commit

1

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

91

sin or to seek worldly gains; rather each group believed that it was in
the right and that its opposite number was transgressing, so it was
obliged to fight it and bring it back to compliance with the command
of Allah (B).Some of them were right, and some of them were
wrong, hut they are to be excused for their misjudgement; if the one
who makes a mistake has based his decision on what he thinks is a
valid reason, there is no sin on him. The view of Ah1 as-Sunnah is
that 'Ali (&) was the one who was in the right in this conflict. The
issues were so ambiguous that some of the Companions were
uncertain, so they stayed away from both groups and did not fight;
they were not certain who was in the right, so they refrained from
helping them."z98

1.6.10. The date of the Battle of the Camel
The historians differed conceming the date of the Battle of the
Camel, and there are numerous opinions, including the following:
(a) Khaleefah ibn Khayyi? narrated via Qatidah that the two
groups met on a Thursday halfway through the month of
Jumida a l - h r a h in 36 AH, and that the hattle took place
on ~ r i d a ~ . ' ~ ~
(b) 'Umar ibn Shabbah narrated that the battle took place in
the middle of Jumida al-&ah
in 36

(c) At-Tabari narrated via al-Wiqidi that the battle took place
on Thursday, 10 Jumida al-&ah
36 AH?"
(d) Al-Mas'oodi stated that the battle took place on Thursday,
10 Jumiida al-Oola.
The most correct opinion is that narrated by Khaleefah ibn
Khayyit via Qatiidah, as the chain of narration of this report is the
soundest conceming this matter.

1.6.11. "Shouldn't we leave them alone
when they are Muslim women?"
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) came to the house where the
Mother of the Believers 'A'ishah (I&,) was staying, and he asked for
permission to enter. He greeted hei'with s a l h , and she welcomed
him. The women in the house of Banu Khalaf were weeping for those
who had been killed, including Abdullah and 'Uthmh, the sons of
Khalaf. Abdullah had been killed fighting on 'kishah's side, and
'Uthmh had been kiUed fighting on 'Ali's side. When 'Ali (&)
entered, Safiyyah, the wife of Abdullah, Umm Talhah, said to him:
"May Allah make your children orphans as you have made my
children orphans!" 'Ali (&) did not respond. When he left, she
repeated her words, and he again kept quiet. A man said to him: "0
Amir al-Mu'mineen, are you going to keep quiet when this woman is
saying what you can hear?" 'Ali (&)

commanded to leave women alone when they were polytheists, so
shouldn't we leave them alone when they are ~ u s l i m s ? " ~ ~ ~

1.6.12. Abu Bakrah ath-Thaqafi's request to
not be appointed as governor of Basra

'Abdur-R&mk ibn Abi Bakrah ath-Thaqafi came to Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) and swore allegiance to him. 'Ali asked about
his father, saying: "Where is the one who is sick?" 'Abdur-Ramh
said: "By Allah, he is indeed sick, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, but he is
very keen to please you." 'Ali (&) said: "Walk in front of me." He
went and visited him, and he offered him the position of governor of
Basra, but Abu Bakrah refused and said: "How about a man from
among your relatives whom the people trust?" He suggested Ibn
'Abbh, so 'Ali appointed Ibn 'AbbL as governor of Basra, and he
appointed Ziyid ibn Abeehi to be in charge of the land tax and the
public treasury; then he ordered Ibn 'AbbL to listen to ~ i ~ 2 d . ~ ~ ~

A man said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, there are two men at the
door who are reviling 'pishah." 'Ali ordered al-Qa'qi? ibn 'Amr to
flog each of them with one hundred lashes and to strip them of their
clothes, and al-Qa'qi? did that.3M

It was narrated that Muhammad ihn 'Urayh said: "A man

came and said: 'Who is this man who is reviling the wife of our
Prophet? Shut up, you ugly, obnoxious and blameworthy man!"'305
According to another report, he said: "Get lost, you ugly man! Are
you insulting the beloved of the Messenger of Allah ( B ) ? " ~ ~

1.7. Between 'kishah the Mother
of the Believers and Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali ibn Abi T2lib
'A3ishahthe Mother of the Believers (I$&) is as-Siddeeqah, the
daughter of as-Siddeeq Abu Bakr Abdullah ihn 'Uthmiin, Her mother
was Umm Roomiin hint 'Uwaymir al-Kinihiyyah, and she was born
four or five years after the Prophet's mission began. The Prophet (g)
married her when she was six years old and consummated the
marriage with her when she was nine years old, in the month of
Shaww2 1 AH (or it was said in 2 AH). She was declared innocent
from above the seven heavens. She was the dearest of the Prophet's

94

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

wives to him and the only virgin that he married. She was the most
knowledgeable of all the women of the Ummah, all of the most
prominent among the Companions would consult her if they were
uncertain about any religious matter. The Prophet (g)
died when she
was eighteen years old, and she (%) died on the night before 17
Ramadan in 58 AH. Abu ~ u r a ~ r & ( & )led the funeral prayer for
her, and she was buried in Baqee' Cemetery -may Allah be pleased
with her and make her pleased.3o8 Her virtues are many and well
known, and there are sound hadiths describing virtnes that were
unique to her among all the Mothers of the Believers, including the
following:

1.7.1. The angel brought her image to
the Prophet (g)
on a cloth of fine silk309
before her mamage to him
The two shaykhs, Bukhari and Muslim, narrated that 'A'ishah
said that the Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "I was shown in my
dreams for three nights that an angel brought you to me wrapped in a
cloth of silk, saying, 'This is your wife.' I uncovered your face and
saw that it was you, and I said: 'If this is from Allah, then He will
bring it to pass. ,,,310

1.7.2. The most beloved of the
wives of the Prophet (B)
He stated his love for her clearly when he was asked about the
dearest of people to him. Bnkhari narrated, with his chain of narration
going back to 'Amr ibn al-'AS, that the Prophet (g)
sent him at the
head of the army of Dhit a s - ~ a I % i l . ~He
~ ' said: "I came to him and
said: 'Who among the people is dearest to you? He (@J said:
"pishah.' I said: 'Who among men?' He (g)
said: 'Her father.'"312
Al-Hz&- a&-Dhahabi said: "This is a proven report in spite of the

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

95

Rsfidis. The Prophet (g)
never loved anyone except those who were
good, and he said: 'If I were to have taken a close friend @haleel)
from among this Ummah, I would have taken Ahu Bakr as a close
friend, but the brotherhood of Islam is better.' So he loved the best
man among his Ummah and the best woman among his Ummah.
Whoever hates the two who were beloved to the Messenger of Allah
(g)
deserves to he hated by AUah (&) and His Messenger (g).
The
Prophet's love for 'kishah is well h o w n and widely reported."313

1.7.3. The Prophet (8
received
)
revelation
when he was under her blanket with her,
but never with his other wives
Bukhari narrated, with his chain of narration going hack to
H i s h h ibn 'Urwah, that the people would try to take their gifts to the
Prophet ( a ) when it was 'kishah's day. 'A'ishah (I$&) said: "My
co-wives went to Umm Salamah and said: '0 Umm Salamah, by
Allah, the people try to bring their gifts when it is 'A'ishah's day, and
we want some of this goodness as 'A'ishah wants it. Tell the
Messenger of Allah (@)
~.
to instmct the people to bring their gifts to
him wherever he is and wherever he goes.' Umm Salamah mentioned
that to the Prophet ( a ) , and she (later) said: 'He turned away from
me. When he turned back to me, I mentioned it to him again, and he
turned away from me. The third time I said it to him, he said: "0
Umm Salamah, do not annoy me with regard to 'kishah, for by
Allah, the revelation never comes down to me when I am under the
blanket of any of you except her.""'314 Adh-Dhahahi said: "This
response indicates that the superiority of 'A'ishah to the other
Mothers of the Believers was something that was divinely ordained
and was not just because he loved her; rather this was one of the
reasons he loved her."315

96

1.7.4. Jibreel (m)sent his greeting of
saliim to her with the Prophet (g)
Bukhari narrated, with his chain of narration going back to
'A'ishah (I$&,), that the Messenger of Allah (g)
said to her one day:
"0 'L'ishah, this is Jihreel sending greetings of s a l h to you." She
said: "And upon him be peace and the mercy of Allah and His
blessings. You see what I cannot see," referring to the Messenger of

1.7.5. The Prophet (B)went to her first
when the verse instructing him to give
his wives the choice was revealed
That was also accompanied by the instruction to consult her
parents about the matter, because he knew that they would not tell her
to leave him. She chose Allah (&) and His Messenger (@J and the
home of the hereafter, and the rest of his wives followed her example.
Bukhari and Muslim narrated, with their chain of narration going
back to 'A'ishah (I&), that she said: "When the Messenger of AUah
(g)
was commanded to give his wives the choice, he started with
me, and he said: 'I am going to tell yon something, but you do not
have to rush until you consult your parents.' He knew that my parents
would never tell me to leave him. Then he said: 'Allah, may He be
glorified and praised, said: 40 Prophet [Muhammad]! Say to your
wives: 'If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, then come! I
will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner

1.7.6. The revelation of verses of the
Book of Allah because of her
These include verses that speak about her in particular and
others that are for the Ummah as a whole. Those that are about her in
particular, which speak of her virtue and high status, are the verses in
which Allah (&) testifies that she is innocent of the accusations and
slanders against her. He ( B )says:
e e r i l y , those who brought forth the slander [against 'A'ishah the
wife of the Prophet] are a group among you. Consider it not a bad
thing for you. Nay, it is good for you. Unto every man among them
will be paid that which he had earned of the sin, and as for him among
them who had the greater share therein, his will be a great torment.)
(Qur'an 24: 11)

4Bad statements are for bad people [or bad women for bad men] and
bad people for bad statements [or bad men for bad women]. Good
statements are for good people [or good women for good men] and
good people for good statements [or good men for good women]:
such [good people] are innocent of [every] bad statement which they
say; for them is forgiveness, and Rizqun Karim [generous provision,
i.e. paradisel.8
(Qur'an 24: 26)

Ibn d-Qayyim said: "One of her virtues is that Allah
declared her innocent of that which the people of the slander accused
her of, and He (&) sent down concerning her innocence revelation
that will be recited in the mosques (in the prayer niches that face
Makkah) and prayers of the Muslims until the Day of Resurrection.
He testified that she is one of the good,
and He promised her
forgiveness and a generous provision (referring to paradise). He (&)
stated that the lies that were told about her were good
for her, and that

what was said about her was not bad for her and did not undermine
her position; rather Allah ($g) raised her in status thereby, and her

goodness and innocence became well-known among all the
inhabitants of heaven and earth. What a great virtue this is! Think
about this honour that stemmed from her extreme modesty and
humbleness when she said: 'I thought of myself as too insignificant
for Allah to speak about me in revelation that would be recited, but I
was hoping that the Messenger of Allah
would see a dream in
which Allah would prove my innocence."'318

a)

This is the Siddeeqah of this Ummah, the Mother of the
Believers, the beloved of the Messenger of Allah (gJ.
She knew that
she was innocent and had been wronged, and that those who were
accusing her were wrongdoers and fabricators. Their accusations also
hurt her parents and the Messenger of Allah (@J3I9
Ibn Katheer
said: "When the people of the slander spoke against her on the basis
of fabrications and lies, Allah (s)
got angry and sent down, to prove
her innocence, ten verses of Qur'an that will be recited until the end
of time. The scholars are unanimously agreed that whoever slanders
her after she has been proven innocent is a disbeliever."320
With regard to that which was revealed because of her but for
the Ummah in general, it is the verse that permits dry-eaah ablution
to be performed when no pure water is available. This was a mercy
and made things easy for the entire Ummah. Bukhari narrated, with
his chain of narration going back to 'kishah (&), that she borrowed
a necklace from Asma' and lost it, so the ~ e s s e n ~of
e rAllah (gJ
sent some of his Companions out to look for it. The time for prayer
came, and they prayed without wudoo'. When they came to the
Prophet (@), they complained to him about that, and the verse of d q eaah ablution was revealed. Usayd ibn Hudayr said: "May Allah
reward you with good, for by Allah nothing happened to yon that you
dislike but Allah caused it to bring good to you and to the
~uslims."~~'

1.7.7. When the Messenger of AUah (g)
was ill,
he wanted to be cared for in 'kishah's house
He (g)
died leaning on her chest, on the day of her turn.AUah
(g)
caused his saliva to be mixed with hers during his last moments
in this world and his first moments in the hereafter, and he was buried
in her
Bukhari narrated, with his chain of narration going
back to 'A'ishah, that when the Messenger of Allah (g)
was ill, he
used to go around to his wives and say: "Where will I be tomorrow?"
because he looked forward to being in 'kishah's house. She said:
"When it was my day, he settled down there."323 Muslim narrated
that she said: "The Messenger of Allah (@) used to check and ask:
'Where will I be today? Where will I be tomorrow?', hoping that the
turn of 'kishah was close. When it was my day, Allah ( B )took his
soul when he was between my neck and my chest."3ze.
His wives gave him permission to go wherever he wanted, and
he remained in 'A'ishah's house until he died there. 'A'ishah said:
"He died on the day that was my day, in my house. Allah took his
soul when his head was between my neck and my chest and his
saliva was mixed with mine." Then she said: " 'Abdur-R@mh ibn
Abi Bakr came in, with a stick used as a natural toothbrush. The
Messenger of Allah looked at it, and I said to him: 'Give me this
toothbrush, 0 'Abdur-R@mh.' He gave it to me and I cut it, then I
chewed it and gave it to the Messenger of AUah (g),
who brushed
his teeth with it while he was leaning on my chest." Another report
adds: "So Allah mixed my saliva with his on his last day in this world
and his fust day in the hereafter."325

1.7.8. He (g)

Al-H&m narrated, with his chain of narration going back to

that she said: "I said: '0 Messenger of Allah, who will

be your wives in paradise?' He said: 'You will be one of them."' She
said: "I thought that the reason was that be did not marry any other
virgin except me."326 Bnkhari narrated with his chain of narration
going back to al-Qbim ibn Muhammad that when 'kishah fell sick,
Ibn 'AbbL came to her and said: "0 Mother of the Believers, you are
going to meet those who went ahead of you, the Messenger of Allah
and Abu ~ a k r . " ~This

'A'ishah (I$&) because he confirmed to her that she would enter

thoughts, so he must have heard it from the

1.7.9. The superiority of ' ~ i s h a h(I&,)

over other women is like the superiority
of thareed 329 over other kinds of food
Bukhari and Muslim narrated, with their chain of narration
going back to Abdullah ibn 'Abdur-Rahmiin, that he heard Anas ibn
Maik
say: "I heard the Messenger of Allah (gJsay: 'The
superiority of 'A'ishah over other women is like the superiority of
thareed over other kinds of food."'330

(4)

An-Nawawi said: "The scholars said: it means that thareed is
better than broth, and thareed with meat is better than broth without
thareed, and the thareed that has no meat is better than broth. What is
meant by better is that it is more nutritious, more filling, easier to
digest, more enjoyable and easier to eat, a person may eat his fill of it
quickly, and so on. It is better than all kinds of broth and all kinds of
food. The superiority of 'A'ishah over other women is great, as great
as the superiority of thareed over other kinds of food. This does not
clearly state that she is better than Maryam and Asiy&, it could be
that what is meant is that she is superior to the women of this
~mmah."~~'

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

101

These are a few of the hadiths which point to the virtue, status
and seniority of 'A'ishah (I&) and to the high esteem in which she is
held in Islam. Despite that, 'kishah, the Mother of the Believers, has
been subjected to slander, criticism, lies and fabrications by the
R2fi& Shia and those who were influenced by their fabricated
reports. They also discussed sound reports and sound hadiths, but
they misinterpreted them and understood them in a way that differed
from the actual meanings. This is what was done by the author of the
book Thumma Zhtadaytu, who did not come up with anything new;
he simply followed in the footsteps of his predecessors among the
R%& Shia. He slandered the Mother of the Believers by
misinterpreting the words of 'Ammk "By Allah, she is the wife of
your Prophet in this world and in the hereafter but Allah, may He be
blessed and exalted, is testing you by means of her, so that He may
know whether you will obey Him or her."332 There is nothing in
these words of 'Arnm2r that could be understood as undermining
'kishah (I&);
in fact, it mentions her greatest virtue, which is that
.i
she is the wife of our Prophet (g)
in this world and in the hereafter.
What virtue could he greater than that?
The aim of every believer is to please Allah (s)and attain
paradise, and 'kishah )&t(
attained that, according to the testimony
of 'Amm2r (&). He held a different view than hers with regard to
that turmoil, b"t he testified that she would he in the highest degrees
of paradise, in the company of the Messenger of Allah
Thus
the sound hadith, which can he attributed to the Prophet (B),
according to what al-H%im narrated in al-Mustadi-uk from 'kishah
(&), says that the Prophet (g)
- , said to her: "Would it not not please
you to he my wife in this world and in the hereafter?" She said: "Yes,
by Allah." He said: "You are indeed my wife in this world and in the
hereafter."334 This hadith points to one of the greatest virtues of
'.&'ishah (I$+). Hence Bukhari narrated the previous report from
'Amm2r under the heading of "The virtues of 'i'ishah (@)."335
.~

102

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

As for his words in the last part of the report, "...but Allah, may
He be blessed and exalted, is testing you by means of her, so that He
may know whether you will obey Him or her," this is not
undermining the position of the Mother of the Believers 'A'ishah
(%) at all, for the following reasons:
(a) 'Ammir's words represent his own opinion; 'A'ishah (I$+)
held a different opinion and thought that what she was
doing was right. Each of them was a noble Companion and
possessed a high level of religious commitment and
knowledge, so the view of one of them was not binding
upon the other.336
(b) All that may be understood from the words of 'Ammi%is

that she was going against the command of Allah in that
particular case, but not everyone who takes a contrary
stance is blameworthy unless proof is shown to them and
they realise that they are wrong. Otherwise, they may be
excused if they did not deliberately go against the
command of Allah, because they may have been unaware,
or their actions may have been based on misinterpretation,
so they are not to be blamed for that.
(c) 'Ammi% (@) did not intend thereby to criticise or
undermine 'A'ishah; his intention was to point out her
mistaken stance out of sincerity towards the Ummah.
Nevertheless, he recognised her status and
According to some versions of this report from 'Ammir (&),
he heard a man reviling 'A'ishah (@), and he said: "Shut up, you
ugly, hateful man! By Allah, she is the wife of your Prophet in this
world and in the hereafter, but Allah is testing yon by means of her,
so that He may know whether yon will obey Him or her."338
The Rzfidi Shia say that the Prophet (g)once stood up to
deliver a speech, and he pointed towards '2ishah's house and said:

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

103

"Here is fitnah, from where the horns of the Satan emerge." This i s a
slander against 'ii'ishah (&),as they claim that the Messenger
meant that fitnah would emerge from her house. These are
misleading words, which turn the facts upside down and confuse
those among the common people who have no knowledge. They
explained what the narrator said, "Then he pointed (towards
'kishah's house)," as meaning that he was pointing towards
'ii'ishah's house and that she would be the cause of turmoil. But the
hadith does not indicate that in any way whatsoever, and this phrase
cannot he interpreted as meaning that by anyone who has the slightest
knowledge of what words mean. The narrator said he pointed
'towards 'kishah's house'; he didnot say 'at 'L'ishah's house'. The
difference between the two expressions is quite clear. The report in
question was narrated by Bukhari in K i t 2 Fard al-Khums339 and
was also narrated in the books of Sunnah, the two Saheehs of Bukhari
and Muslim and elsewhere, with a number of chains of narration and
in more than one version. The text states the land referred to, which
refutes the claim of the R Z & Shia, and there is no need to refute the
argument in any other way. The following are some of the versions of
the hadith via many chains of narration from Ihn 'Umar (&):

(s)

It was narrated from Layth from N Z ' from Ihn 'Umar (&)
..
that he heard the Messenger of Allah (@J say, when he was facing
towards the east: "Verily fitnah is there, where the horn of the Satan
will emerge."340
It was narrated that 'Ubaydullah ibn 'Umar said: NZ'
narrated to me from Ibn 'Umar that the Messenger of AUah (g)
stood at Haf~ah'sdoor and pointed towards the east and said: "Fitnah
will appear from where the horn of the Satan is."341He said it two or
three times.
It was narrated from Silim ibn Ahdullah from his father that
the Messenger of Allah
said, while facing towards the east:

(a)

104

l%e Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue uf arbitration

"Verily fitnah is there, verily fitnah is there, verily fitnah is there,
where the horn of the Satan will appear."34z
In these reports, the direction referred to is clearly specified; it
is the east. This explains what is meant by the pointing that is referred
to by the Rifidi ~ b i a In. some
~ ~ ~other versions of the hadith, the
country referred is specified. It was narrated from N Z ' that Ibn
'Umar said: "The Prophet (g)
said: '0 Allah, bless us in our Syria; 0
Allah, hless us in our Yemen.' They said: '0 Messenger of Allah, and
in our ~ a j d .I 'think
~ ~ he
~ said the third time: 'There are earthquakes
and fitnah there, and in it the horn of the Satan will appear."'345

It was narrated from S%m ibn Ahdullah ibn 'Umar that he
said: "0 people of Iraq, bow much you ask about minor sins, and
how many major sins you commit! I heard my father, Ahdullah ibn
'Umar, say: I heard the Messenger of Allah (@J say: 'Turmoil will
come from there,' and he pointed towards the east, where the horn of
the Satan will appear."346
According to some reports, the names of some of the tribes
who live in that land are mentioned, and the situation of their people
is described. It was narrated that Abu Mas'ood said: "The Messenger
of Allah (g)
pointed with his hand towards Yemen and said: 'Faith
is there, and harshness and hardheartedness are among the uncouth
owners of camels, where the horns of the Satan rise, Rahee'ah and
M ~ d a r . " 'This
~ ~ ~report definitively indicates that what the Prophet
(g)
meant when he said "fitnah is there" was the eastern lands, as
the reports clearly state. In some of the reports, the people of that land
are described and some tribes are mentioned by name, which clearly
demonstrates the falseness of the claims made by the Rifidi Shia that
what he was pointing at was 'A'ishah's house. This is an invalid
opinion and a worthless point of view; no one came up with this
understanding or spoke of it except the Rifidi ~hia."'

1.7.10. Comparative virtues of 'kishah, Khadeejah
and Fgtirnah (may Allah be pleased with them all)
Ibn Taymiyah said: "The best women of this Ummah are
Khadeejah, ' ~ i s h a hand Fstimah, but as to which of these three is
better than the others, there is some dispute."349 Ibn Taymiyah was
asked about which of the two Mothers of the Believers was better,
Khadeejah or 'A'ishah. He replied: "In terms of seniority, influence
at the beginning of Islam and support of the religion, Khadeejah is
superior, and neither 'A'ishah nor any of the other Mothers of the
Believers share that virtne with her. As for 'A'ishah's influence later
on, her devotion to Islam and conveying it to the U.mmah and her
attainment of knowledge, neither Khadeejah nor any of the others
share that virtue with her, which distinguishes her from others."350
Ibn Hajar said: "It was said that there was consensus on the
superiority of Fitimah, and that the difference of opinion remained
with regard to whether 'A'ishah or Khadeejah was more
virtuous."351 Commenting on the hadith of Abu Hurayrah about the
angel Jibreel (as) coming to the Prophet (g)
and telling him to
convey s a l b to Khadeejah from her Lord, Ibn Hajar said that asSuhayli said: "Abu Bakr ibn Diwood quoted this story as evidence
that Khadeejah is superior to 'A'ishah, because Jibreel sent greetings
to ' ~ i s h a hfrom himself, but to Khadeejah he conveyed greetings
from her Lord. Ibn al-'Arabi claimed that there was no disputing that
Khadeejah was superior to 'A'ishah. He narrated that this argument
was an old issue, and that it was more likely that Khadeejah was
superior because of this (the s a l h being conveyed to her from her
Lord) and because of what is mentioned above."352
From studying the texts that were nanated concerning the
virtnes of each one of them (may Allah be pleased with them), we
find that they point to the superiority of Khadeejah and F i m a h , then
'A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with them all) because the Prophet

106

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

(g)said: "Khadeejah was given precedence over the women of my
~ m m a h , " ~and,
' ~ "The best of the women of paradise are Khadeejah,
FS@ah, Maryam and A ~ i ~ a h . "Ibn
~'~
Hajar said: "This is a clear
statement that cannot be interpreted in any other way."355 The
Prophet (g)
also said: "The best of the women of this world are
Maryam hint 'Imrk, Khadeejah hint Khuwaylid, Fgtirnah hint
Muhammad and Asiyah the wife of ~ h a r a o h . " ~This
' ~ states that
Khadeejah (I&,) is the best of the women of this Ummah. Moreover,
the wording of the reports about the superiority of Ficimah, in which
the Prophet (g)
-, said: "0 Ficimah, does it not please you to be the
leader of the believing women or the leader of the women of this
~ m m a h ? " ~ ' ~or, according to another version: "the leader of the
women of the people of paradise"358-is a clear statement in which
there is no ambiguity, and it cannot be interpreted in any other way. It
is the statement that she is the best of the women of this Ummah and
the leader of the women of the people of paradise. Fitimah shared
with her mother in this superiority, for she and her mother are the best
of the women of the people of paradise, and she and her mother are
the best of the women of this Ummah. This is what the texts say.359
-

With regard to what is narrated about the superiority of
'kishah (I$&) in the hadith, "The superiority of 'A'ishah over other
women is like the superiority of thareed over all other kinds of food,"
this wording does not imply absolute superiority. Ibn Hajar 360 said:
"This does not imply that 'A'ishah (!&) is superior to all others,
because the virtue of thareed, in comp&son to other foods, is that it
is easy to cook and easy to digest, and it was the best of their food at
that time. None of these attributes necessarily implies superiority in
every way. It may be inferior to other types of food in other
ways."361So the hadith indicates that 'kishah (&) is superior to all
the women of this Ummah except Khadeejah and Fitimah, because
of the evidence to that effect, which puts a limit on 'A'ishah's

'Ali ibn Abi Ta^lib

107

With regard to the hadith of 'Amr ibn al-'AS, in which he
asked the Prophet (g):
"Who among women his dearest to you?",
and he ( g ) said ' k i ~ h a h Ibn
.~~
S~
b b k suggested that this was a
question that was about his wives only, and he wrote this heading in
his Saheeh: "Quoting a report and misinterpretation of one who does
not have proper understanding of the science of hadith." Under this
heading, he quoted the hadith of 'Amr as follows: "I said: '0
Messenger of Allah, who among the people is dearest to you?' He
said: "kishah.' I said: 'I do not mean women; rather I mean men.'
He said: 'Abu Bakr' or 'her father."' Then Ibn Hibbk said: "I am
going to quote the report indicating that the question was about his
wives and not about women in general, such as F2timah and others."
He narrated, with his chain of narration from Anas, that the latter
said: "The Messenger of Allah ( g ) was asked: 'Who is the dearest of
people to you? He said: "kishah.' It was said to him: 'We are not
asking about your family.' He said: 'Her father.'364 Thus it is clear
that 'kishah (I&) comes after Khadeejah and F2timah in virtue, so
all the reports ihat indicate her superiority in general are to he
understood in light of the reports about Khadeejah and Fgtimah,
which limit that superiority. No doubt 'kishah (&) had many
virtues, such as her howledge, which were exclusively hers and
which she did not share with Khadeejah and F%timah,but the fact that
a virtue is proven does not necessarily mean that she was superior in
every aspect."365
Whatever the case, the superiority of one of them over another
does not undermine the lesser one; rather this is the greatest evidence
of the high status of these three women, Filmah, Khadeejah and
'A'ishah (may Allah be pleased with them), as the difference of
opinion is not about the fact that these women are the best of the
women of this Ummah. What harm does it do to the Mother of the
Believers 'kishah if she is the third of the women of this Ummah in

108

virtue? Is this a call to respect and honour her, or to undermine and
slander her, as the Rsfidi Shia do?366

(a),

+*: Did 'kishah, the Mother of the Believers ..
regard it as permissible to fight the Muslims
at the Battle of the Camel?

We have seen above that she did not set out to do that, and she
did not want to fight. Az-Zuhri narrated that she said after the Battle
of the Camel: "I wanted my status to prevent people from fighting,
and I did not think that there would be any fighting among the
people. If I had known that, I would never have adopted this
stance."367 The view that 'A'ishah (%) regarded fighting the
Muslims as permissible is false and cannot stand up to the sound
reports showing that 'A'ishah (@J) only went out in order to set
things straight, as we have seen. 6 fact, this opinion stems from the
reports which were fahricated by the R%i@ Shia, which distorted the
history of early Islam and described what took place between 'Ali
and Tabah, az-Zubayr and 'pishah as civil war. Some researchers
were influenced by these reports to the extent that one of them said
that 'kishah was taken prisoner, and they present the issue as a civil
was that was previously planned for. This is a view which is to be
expected from researchers who took their information concerning
this matter only from fabricated reports and sources that cannot he
trusted, including the books al-lmcimah was-S jdsah, al-Aghini,
Murooj adh-Dhahab and Tareekh al-Ya 'qoobi, and even Tareekh alTamaddun al-lslami by Georgy ~ a ~ d i n . ~ ~ '
Can this hadith be true: "You will fight 'Ali,
and you will be in the wrong"?

0:.

It is not to be found in any of the reliable books of knowledge,
and it has no known chain of narrators; it is more likely to be found
among the fabricated hadiths than among the sound ones. In fact, it is

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

109

a blatant lie because 'A'ishah did not fight, and she did not go out to
fight; she went out with the aim of setting things straight among the
people. She did not fight, and she did not enjoin fighting. This is what
has been stated by more than one of those who have knowledge of
reports.369

*:. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) wanted to send

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) prepared everything that
' ~ i s h a hneeded of mounts, provisions and so on, and he sent with
her those who had survived of the people who had come out with her,
except for those who wanted to stay. He chose forty well-known
women of Basra to accompany her, and he said: "Get ready, 0
Muhammad (ibn al-Hanafiyyah) to ttake her there." On the day of her
departure, 'Ali (&) came and stood. The people came, and she came
out to the people; they bade farewell to her, and she bade farewell to
them. She said: "0 my sons, we got angry with one another because
some of us thought that action should he taken more quickly. None of
you should use recent events as a reason for transgressing against
others. By Allah, there was nothing between me and 'Ali in the past
except what there may be between a woman and her in-laws. For me,
despite this misunderstanding, he is one of the best." 'Ali (&) said:
"0 people, she has spoken the tmth, and by Allah, she has been
sincere. There is nothing between me and her except that (meaning
that which there may be between a woman and her in-laws). She is
the wife of your Prophet (8)
in this world and the hereafter."
She departed on a Saturday at the beginning of the month of
Rajah in 36 AH. 'Ali (&) walked with her for many miles, and he
sent his sons to walk with her for a day.370By this noble treatment on
the part of Amir al- mineen en 'Ali (&), we see that he was

'A'ishah." 'Ali (&) had asked: "Me, 0 Messenger of Allah?" He
said: "Yes." 'Ali said: "Me?" He said: "Yes." 'Ali said: "Then I
must he the most doomed of all,0 Messenger of Allah." The Prophet
(B)said: "No, but if that happens, send her hack to her safe

Those people were mistaken who said that 'kishah
went
out on a campaign to Basra because she had a grndge aga&st 'Ali

of immorality during the incident of the slander. At that time, the
Prophet
had consulted him with regard to leaving her, and 'Ali
(4)
had said: "0 Messenger of Allah, Allah has not made things
restricted for you, and there are many women other than her. If you
ask the slave woman, she will tell you the truth."372 'Ali (&) said
these words to show more care to the Prophet (B),
because he saw
the wonies and distress that he was suffering due to what was being
said. 'Ali (&) was a man of strong protective jealousy, so he
thought that if the Prophet (g)
separated from 'kishah (&), the
anxiety that he was feeling because of her would be eased n k l her
innocence was established, at which time he could take her back.
his may have been a case of choosing the lesser of two evils so as to
ward off the greater.373

slightest indication that he doubted her morals. Even though he said
to the Prophet (g):

good about her (I&$. On the same day, the Messenger of Allah went
out to the people to ask for support against Abdullah ibn Ubayy,
saying: "0 Muslims, who will support me against a man who has
offended me with regard to my family? By Allah, I know nothing but
good about my family."378Therefore 'Ali's advice was in 'pishah's
best interest, as the Prophet (g)
became more convinced of what he
already believed about his wife's innocence.379 'Ali's attitude
concerning the slander incident was not something that made
'pishah (I$,+) angry with him or made her cany a grudge that led her
to falsely accuse him of murdering 'Uthmh (&) and go out inciting
huge numbers of Muslims against him, as claimed by many
researchers who based their claims on the reports fabricated by the
R%& Shia.
*:* Their regret for what they had done

Ibn Taymiyah said: "That was the case for all the Companions
who got involved; they regretted the fighting in which they had
engaged. Tabah, az-Zubayr, 'Ali and others all regretted it. On the
day of the Camel, none of them intended to fight, but fighting broke
out against their wishes."380
(a) It was narrated that when 'Ali (&) looked and saw that
men had drawn their swords and started to fight, he said:
"Would that I had died twenty years before this."381
@) Na'eem ibn Hamm2d narrated, with his chain of narration

going back to al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, that he said to Sulaymh
ibn Sard: "I saw 'Ali, when the fighting grew intense,
staying close to me and saying: '0 Hasan, would that I had
died twenty years before this."'382

The Battles of the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

(c) It was narrated that al-Hasan ibn 'Ali said: "Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali wanted one thing, hut matters spun out of
control, and he could not do anything about it."383
(d) It was narrated from Sulaymh ibn S a d , from al-Hasan
ibn 'Ali,that he heard 'Ali say, when he saw the swords
that the people were wielding: "0 Hasan, would that I had
died twenty or forty years before this."384
(e) With regard to 'A'ishah, it was narrated that she used to
say, when remembering the Battle of the Camel: "Would
that I had stayed away like my co-wives. It would have
been dearer to me to give birth to many children from the

it became clear that not going out would have been better.
When she remembered going out, she would weep until
her headcover became wet. This is how the majority of the
earliest Muslims were; they regretted the fighting in which
they had become involved. Talhah, az-Zubayr, 'Ali and

others regretted it. On the day of the Camel, the people had
no intention of fighting, but fighting broke out against
their
(i) Adh-Dhahabi said: "No doubt 'kishah completely
regretted going out to Basra and being present on the day
of the Camel, and she did not think that the matter would
reach the point it did."389

1.8. The life and martyrdom of
az-Zubayr ibn al-'AwwSm (4)
His full name was Abu Abdullah az-Zubayr ibn Khuwaylid
ibn Asad ibn 'AbdulL'Uzza ibn Qusayy ibn Kilib a1-Qurashi al~ s a d i . ~He
~ 'shared a common ancestor with the Prophet (g)
in
Qusayy, and he was the disciple of the Messenger of Allah (g)
and
the son of his paternal aunt. His mother was Safiyyah bint ' ~ b d u l Muttalib.
..
He was one of the ten whom the Prophet (g)
testified
would be in paradise and one of the members of the consultative
committee.391He became M u s h when he was a young man, at the
age of sixteen,392and he was tortured because of that. It was narrated
that ai-Zubayr's paternal uncle used to roll him up in a mat and hang
it up, then he would light a fire underneath so that the smoke would
reach him. His uncle would tell him to go back to disbelief, but azZubayr would say: "I will never go back to disbelief."393 He never
missed any campaign that was led by the Messenger of Allah ($g).394

1.8.1. The first one to unsheathe
his sword for the sake of Allah (&)
It was narrated that Sa'eed ibn al-Mnsayyab said: "The first
one to unsheathe his sword for the sake of Allah was ai-Zubayr ibn
al-'Awwh. While a*-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwgm was taking a nap, he

114

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

heard someone shouting that the Messenger of Allah (g)
had been
killed, so he came out of his house unsheathing and brandishing his
sword. He was met head-on by the Messenger of Allah (g),
who
said: 'What is the matter, 0 Zuhayr?' He said: 'I heard that you had
been killed.' The Prophet (g)
said: 'What were you going to do?' He
said: 'By AUah, I was going to take revenge on all the people of
Makkah.' The Prophet (g)
prayed for good for him." Sa'eed said: "I
am certain that the Prophet's prayer for him will not he overlooked by
(@)."395

1.8.2. His migration to Abyssinia
When the persecution of the Messenger of Allah (gJand his
Companions by Quraysh grew intense, he suggested to them that
they should migrate to Abyssinia, where they could live under the
care of the Negus, the just king. They stayed with him in the best land
and under the best care, and they remained there safe and secure until
an Abyssinian man came to fight the Negus for his kingdom. The
Muslims grieved deeply; they were afraid that this new man would
prevail and would not recognise the virtue and status of the pure
Companions (may Allah he pleased with them). The Companions
wanted to find out about the conflict that was taking place between
the Negus and that man on the other side of the ~ i l e Umm
. ~ ~ ~
Salamah
said: "The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'Who~willgo out to see the battle and bring hack news?' AzZubayr ibn al-'Awwh said, 'I will.' They said, 'You?', because he
was the youngest of the peopie. They inflated a waterskin for him,
and he put it under his chest; then he swam across until he reached
that point of the Nile where the people had met (in battle). He
continued until he reached them. Meanwhile we prayed to Allah (g)
to give the Negus victory over his enemy and to establish him in his
own country. By Allah, we were doing that, waiting for what might
happen, when az-Zubayr came running, waving his garment and

(e)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

115

saying: 'Be of good cheer. The Negus has prevailed, and Allah has
destroyed his enemies and established him in his land."'397 After azZubayr returned from Abyssinia to Makkah, he stayed under the care
of the Beloved Messenger of AUah (g),
learning from him the
principles, commands and prohibitions of Islam. When the
Messenger of Allah migrated to Madinah, az-Zubayr was among
those who migrated there.

1.8.3. At the Battle of Badr
Az-Znbayr (4)
was a courageous horseman and fearless
hero. He did not stay behind from any militaq campaign; he was
present on every campaign and at every battle. He possessed
extraordinary courage, rare heroism, utter sincerity and devotion to
making the word of truth reign supreme.398 Az-Zubayr (&)
sacrificed a great deal for the sake of Allah (.%) and dedicated his life
and his wealth to AUah (&), so Allah (%) honoured him and raised
his status in this world and in the hereafter. It was narrated that
'Urwah said: "On the day of Badr, az-Zubayr was wearing a yellow
turban, and Jibreel came down in the form of a z - ~ u b a ~ rWhat
. " ~ ~a ~
great virtne, which cannot be rivalled by all the adornments of this
world.
It was narrated that az-Zubayr said: "On the day of Badr, I met
'Ubaydah ibn Sa'eed ibn d-'As, who was so heavily armed that
nothing could be seen except his eyes. He was known by the kunyah
Abn Dh2t d-Kursh. He said: 'I am Abu Dhgt d-Knrsh.' I charged at
him and stabbed him in the eye. I put my foot on him, then I pulled
my spear out, and I had to use great force in order to pull it out,
because both ends were bent. The Messenger of AUah (&) asked for
the spear, and I gave it to him." When the Messenger of Allah (g)
died, az-Zubayr took the spear back; then Abn Bakr (&) asked for
it, and he gave it to him. When Abu Balcr died, 'Umar (&)asked for

116

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

it, and he gave it to him. When 'Uthmh (&) was killed, it remained
with the family of 'Ali, (&) then ~bdullahibn az-Zubayr asked for
it, and it was with him when he was killed.400
This report shows us the precision of az-Zubayr in hitting the
target. He was able to aim his spear at the eye of Abu Dhit al-Kursh,
even though that space was very narrow and his attention was
divided between attacking and defending himself. Killing that man
was very unlikely because he had protected his body with so much
armour, but az-Zubayr managed to hit him in the eye, and that was
the end of him. The wound was very deep, which is indicative of azZubayr's physical strength, in addition to his precision and skill in
hitting the target.401On the day of Badr, there were two knights with
the Messenger of Allah (g):
az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwh on the
cavalry of the right flank and al-Miqdid ibn al-Aswad on the cavalry
of the left.40z

1.8.4. At the battle of Uhud
Az-Zubayr (&) said: "On the day of m u d , the Prophet (g)
mentioned both of his parents to me." (In other words, he said: 'May
my father and mother be sacrificed for yo~').403
This indicates that he
was skilful in fighting and strong during that battle. He (&)
displayed great steadfastness, resolve and love of martyrdom for the
sake of Allah (&). He described for us what Abu Dujkah al-An&
did during that battle. When the two armies met and the fighting grew
intense, the Messenger of Allah (&) began to encourage his
Companions and boost their morale. He picked up a sword and said:
"Who will take this from me?" They stretched out their hands, each
man among them, including az-Zubayr, saying, "Me!" He said:
'Who will take it and give it its due?' The people withdrew their
hands, but Sim& ibn Kharashah Abu Dujhah said: "What is its due,
O Messenger of Allah?" He said: "That you should strike the enemy

'Ali ibn Abi Triib

117

with it until is bent." He said: "1 will take it and give it its due." He
gave it to him, and he was a courageous man who walked with pride
in battle. When the Messenger of Allah (gJsaw him walking with
pride among the ranks, he said: "This is a way of walking that Allah
hates except in this situation."404
Az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwim described what Abu Dujhah did
on the day of Uhud, saying: "I felt upset when I asked the Messenger
of Allah (&) for the sword and he withheld it from me, giving it to
Abu Dujhah and not me. I decided that, by Allah, I would watch
what Abu Dujhah did. I followed him, and he took out a red
headband of his and wrapped it around his head. The An@ said:
'Abu Dujhah has taken out the headband of death (meaning that he
wants to fight to the death).' He killed every person that he engaged
in combat. Among the polytheists, there was a man who would not
leave any wounded person without finishing him off. The two of
them began to draw close to one another, and I prayed to Allah (&)
to bring them together. They met, and each dealt a blow to the other.
The polytheist struck Abu Dujbah, who protected himself with his
shield; the polytheist's sword got stuck in the shield, and Ahu
Dujinah struck him and killed him. Then I saw him holding his
sword over the head of Hind bint 'Utbah, hut he moved his sword
away from her, and I said: 'Allah and His Messenger know best."'405
Ibn Ishiq said: "Abu Duj2nah said: 'I saw someone urging the
people on, so I charged at him and wielded my sword at him, and he
screamed. Then I realised that it was a woman, and I respected the
sword of the Messenger of Allah too much to strike a woman with
it.m,406 It was narrated from H i s h h , from his father, that 'A'ishah
said: "0 son of my sister, your forefathers -meaning az-Zubayr and
Abu Bakr - were among dThose who answered [the Call ofl Allah
and the Messenger [Muhammad] after being wounded) (Qur'an 3:
172)."

118

The Banles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

When the polytheists left m u d , and there befell the Prophet

(g)
and his Companions what befell them, the Prophet (?&) was
worried lest the polytheists come hack. He said: "Who will go out
and follow the tracks of these people, so that they may know that we
still have power?" Ahu Bakr, az-Zuhayr and seventy others
volunteered. They went out and followed the tracks of the
polytheists, who left when they heard about them. Allah (&) said:
(So they returned with grace and bounty from Allah. No harm
touched them,) (Qur'an 3: 174) and they did not meet any enemy.407
When Hamzah ihn 'Abdul-Muualih (&) was martyred at
m u d , Umm az-Zuhayr Safiyyah bint 'Ahdul-Muctalib came to look
at her brother. He had been nlutilated by the polytheists; they had cut
off his nose, opened his belly and cut off his ears and genitals. The
Messenger of Allah (gg)
said to her son az-Zubayr ihn al-'Awwim:
"Go and find her, and send her hack, lest she see what has happened
to her brother." Az-Znhayr said to her: "0my mother, the Messenger
of Allah (@) is telling you to go hack." She said: "Why? We have
heard that my brother has been mutilated, hut that was for the sake of
Allah, so we are content with what has happened, and we will seek
reward and be patient inshallah." When az-Zuhayr (&) came to the
Messenger of Allah (g)
and told him that, he said: "Let her go." So
she went and looked at Hamzah. She offered the funeral prayer for
him and said, "Verily to Allah we belong, and to Him is our return."
She also prayed for forgiveness for him.4os
According to another report from 'Urwah, he said: "My father
az-Zubayr told me that when the battle of m u d took place, a woman
came walking. When she was about to reach the place where the slain
were, the Prophet (g)
did not want her to see them, so he said 'The
woman, the woman!"' Az-Zubayr said: ''I thought she was my
mother Safiyyah, so I went out and rushed towards her. I caught up
with her before she reached the slain, hut she shoved me in the chest,

I

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

119

and she was a strong woman. She said, 'Get out of my way, may you
perish!' I said: 'The Messenger of Allah (g)
is insisting that you
(should not see the dead).' She stopped and took out two pieces of
cloth, saying: 'These are two pieces of cloth that I have brought for
my brother Hamzah.' Beside him there was a man of the An$& who
had been killed, and the same had been done to him as had been done
to Hamzah. We did not think it was right to shroud Hamzah in two
pieces of cloth when the An$% did not have any shroud, so we said:
'One cloth for Hamzah, and one for the An$%.' We measured them,
and we found that one piece was larger than the other, so we cast lots
between them, and we shrouded each one in the cloth that was picked
for him."409

1.8.5. During the Battle of the Trench:
"Each Prophet has a disciple,
and my disciple is az-Zubayr"
The Messenger of Allah (B)said on the day of the Trench:
"Who will bring me news of Bann Qurayaah?" Az-Zubayr (&)
said: "I will." So he went on a horse and brought news of them. The
Prophet (g)
said that a second time, and az-Zubayr said again: "I
will." The same thing happened a third time, and the Prophet (g)
said: "Each Prophet has a disciple, and my disciple is a z - ~ u b a y r . " ~ ~ ~
What is meant by his words "my disciple is az-Zubayr" is "the
closest to me of my companions and supporters". The same Arabic
word (haw2ri)is used to refer to the disciples or companions of 'Eesa
those who were his inner circle and supporters. The helper or
disciple is one who offers support and is a close companion. This
hadith refers to this great virtue by which az-Zubayr (&) was
distinguished. Hence when Abdullah ibn 'Umar (&) heard a man
saying: "I am the son of the disciple," he said: "If you are one of the
sons of az-Zubayr, that is correct; otherwise it is not."411

(s),

120

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

In 'Umdat al-Qirifi Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhiri by al-'Ayni, it
says: "Jf you say: all of the Companions are supporters of the
Messenger of Allah ( g ) and close to him, so why is az-Zubayr
singled out for this title?, we would say: He said this on the day of the
Trench, when the Prophet (g)
asked: 'Who will bring me news of
the people?' and az-Zubayr said, 'I will.' That happened three times,
and undoubtedly on that occasion he offered more support than
anyone else."412
On the day of the Trench, the Messenger of Allah ( g ) said to
him: "May my father and mother be sacrificed for you." It was
narrated that Ahdullah ibn az-Zubayr said: "On the day of the Trench,
'Umar ibn Abi Salamah and I were put in charge of the women. I
looked and saw az-Zubayr on his horse, going through the area of
Banu Quraydhah
- two or three times. When I went back, I said: '0 my
father, I saw you going a few times.' He sad: 'Did you see me, 0 my
son? I said: 'Yes.' He said: 'The Messenger of Allah (@) said:
"Who will go to Banu Qurayeah and bring me news of them?", so I
went out, and when I came back, the Messenger of Allah (g)
mentioned me and his parents in the same sentence, saying: "May my
father and mother he sacrificed for yon.""'413 This hadith clearly
indicates the virtue of az-Znbayr (&), because the words spoken by
the Messenger of Allah
in which he expressed his appreciation
for his actions and the high esteem in which he held him, are only
said to a person whom one respects and for whom one would
sacrifice oneself or the dearest of one's family.414

(s),

At the Battle of the Trench, az-Znhayr earned an immortal
badge of honour which will last until the end of time: "Each prophet
had a disciple, and my disciple is a z - ~ u h a ~ r The
. " ~Prophet
~~
(g)
described azZuhayr as a disciple, which has a profound and farreaching meaning. The one who studies this meaning will understand
all the ramifications of this word disciple (hawriri), and its secrets and

'Ali ibn Abi TElib

121

depths. Those who are in greatest need of paying such attention to
these meanings are the scholars, the callers to Islam and the
educators. Islamic da'wah requires the preparation of helpers and
disciples who will present a living example, because a practical
example is more powerful and effective in spreading principles and
ideas. It is an embodiment and practical implementation of those
ideas that can easily be seen and followed, because true disciples
follow the Sunnah of the Messenger (g)
and obey his commands.""
As it says in the hadith: "There is no prophet whom Allah sent to any
nation before me who didn't have from among his nation helpers and
companions who followed his way and obeyed his commands.""'
It is the nature of things that the da'wah win go through trials
and tribulations and be tested by means of both friends and enemies.
The Messenger (g)
was keen to guide the Muslims with regard to
these variables and developments, so he said: 'Then there will come
after them generations who say what they do not do and do what they
do not
What is the mission of the disciple? Setting a
good example of applied faith, sincerity and sacrifice are among the
most prominent attributes of the disciples; thus they are a true
example of the heirs of the Prophets. They strive to spread the truth
and goodness, to guide the Ummah and to lead it out of its
backwardness. They sacrifice everything precious for the sake of
Allah, in order to bring back the vitality and radiance of Islam at a
time when those with little ambition do not care about anything but
their personal interests419
Az-Zubayr ibn al-'Aww%m(&) is a brilliant example of the
embodiment of these principles. He grew up in the lap of da'wah,
under the care of the Prophet (g),
and received a proper education
that enabled him to carry its burdens from an early age. Az-Zubayr's
attitude at the Battle of the Trench shows us his character and his
upbringing in the qualities of courage, support and love of the

s).

Messenger
History shows us that he was a man of difficult
missions, imbued with qualities of courage and bravery, so he was
given the mission of finding out enemy secrets. What happened to azZubayr indicates that it is prescribed to divide tasks and categorize
the people of da'wah according to their sincerity, spirit of sacrifice,
talents and
Az-Zubayr
took part in all the
and carried out honourable
campaigns of the Messenger (g)
exploits. At the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs (may Allah be
pleased with them), he was one of the pillars of the state during the
major conquests.

(4)

1.8.6. At the Battle of Yarmook
It was narrated from 'Urwah that the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said to ai-Zubayr (&) on the day of
Yarmook: "Why don't you charge, and we will charge with you?'
He said: "If1 charge, you will let me down." They said: "We will not
do that." So he charged at the enemy, penetrating their ranks and
passing through them, but there was no one with him. He came hack,
and they took hold of his reins and struck him twice on his shoulder,
and one of them struck a wound that he had received on the day of
Badr. 'Unvah said: "I used to put my fingers in those scars when I
was small, playing with them." 'Urwah also said: "AbduUah ihn aiZubayr was with him that day, and he was ten yean old. He put him
on a horse and entrusted him to a man to look after him."42' AdhDhahabi said in asSiyar, commenting: "This battle was alYamhah, inshallah, because at that time Abdullah was ten years
old."422Ibn Katheer said that the battle was Yarmook, hut there is no
reason why it could not have happened on both occasions.
Ibn Katheer said: "Among those who were present at Yannook
was az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwh, who was the best of the Companions
there; he was a brave and courageous knight. A number of heroes

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

123

rallied around him on that day and said: 'Why don't you attack, and
we will attack with you?' He said: 'You will not be steadfast.' They
said: 'Yes, we will.' So he attacked, and they attacked, but they
stopped when they were met by the Byzantine ranks. He went ahead
and penetrated the Byzantine ranks until he came out the other side
and returned to his companions. Then they came to him again, and
the same happened as had happened the first time. On that day, he
received two wounds between his shoulders, and according to
another report, he was injured."423 Ibn Katheer said on another
occasion: "He went out with the people to Syria as a fighter of jihad;
he was present at Yarmook, and they were honoured by his presence.
He performed brilliant acts of courage on that day, penetrating the
Byzantine ranks twice from front to back."424

1.8.7. The conquest of Egypt
When 'Amr ibn al-'As went to conquer Egypt, he did not have
sufficient forces, so he wrote to 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b (4)
asking
for support and reinforcements. 'Umar was worried about the small
number of 'Amr's forces, so he sent az-Zubayr ibn al-'Aww2m with
twelve thousand men. It was also said that 'Umar sent f o u thousand,
led by the great Companions az-Zubayr, al-Miqd2d ibn al-Aswad,
'Ubidah ibn a s - S h i t and Maslamah ibn Makhlad. (Other narrators
said that K h s j a h ibn Hudh2fah was the fourth.) He wrote to 'Amr:
"I have sent to you four thousand men, each thousand of whom is led
by a man who is equal to a thousand." Az-Zubayr was the leader of
those men.425
When az-Zubayr reached 'Amr, he found him besieging the
fortress of Babylon. Az-Zuhayr quickly mounted his horse and went
around the trench surrounding the fottress, then he spread his men
out around the trench. The siege lasted for seven months, then azZubayr was told that there was a plague inside it. He said: "We have

124

The Battles of the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

come to stab and plague them."426 Conquest was slow for 'Amr ibn
al-'.&, so az-Zubayr said: "I will offer myself for the sake of Allah,
hoping that Allah may grant victory thereby to the Muslims." He set
up a ladder against the wall of the fortress, on the side of the
marketplace of a l - H a n k , then he climbed up. He told them that
when they heard his takbeer, they should all respond. It was not long
before az-Zubayr was at the top of the fortress, shouting takbeer and
wielding his sword. The people began to climb up the ladder until
' A m told them not to, for fear that the ladder might break. When the
Byzantines saw that the Arabs had captured the fortress, they
withdrew. The fortress of Babylon opened its gates to the Muslims,
thus ending a decisive battle in the conquest of Egypt. The rare
courage of az-Zubayr was the direct cause of the Muslims' victov
over ~ u q a w ~ i s . ~ ~ "

1.8.8. The protective jealousy of
az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwgrn (4)
It was narrated that Asma' hint Abi Bakr as-Siddeeq (%)said:
"When I got married to az-Zubayr, he owned nothing in this world
apart from a camel for carrying water and a horse. I used to feed his
horse, bring water, prepare his saddle and make dough, but I was not
. women of the An& who were my neighbours
good at b ~ gSome
used to bake my bread for me, and they were good women. I used to
bring the dates from some land which the Messenger of Allah (@J
had given to az-Zubayr, carrying them on my head. The land was
two-thirds of a farsakh (approximately three miles) away. One day, I
was corning with the dates on my head, and I met the Messenger of
Allah (@)
- , with a group of the An&. He called me and made his
camel kneel down so that I could ride behind him. But I felt too shy to
go with the men, and I remembered az-Zubayr and how jealous he
was, for he was the most jealous of men. The Messenger of Allah
(g)
realised that I felt too shy, so he went on his way. I came to az-

Xli ibn Abi Tcilib

125

Zubayr and told him, 'I met the Messenger of Allah (&) while I was
cawing the dates on my head, and there was a group of his
companions with him. He made his camel kneel down so that I could
ride on it, but I felt too shy, because I remembered yourjealousy.' He
said, 'By Allah, your having to carry the dates is harder for me than
your riding with him.' Later on, Abu Bakr sent a servant who took
care of the horse, and it was as if I had been set free from slavery."4z8

1.8.9. Az-Zubayr named his sons
after martyred Companions
Due to of az-Zubayr's deep love of martyrdom, he named his
sons after martyred Companions. H i s h h ibn 'Uwah narrated that
his father said: "Az-Zubayr said: Talhah named his sons after
Prophets when he learned that there would be no Prophet after
Muhammad
But I named my children after martyrs, in the hope

in praise of az-Zubayr
Az-Zubayr passed by a gathering of the Companions of the
Mes ,enger of Allah
where H a s s h was reciting his poetry to
thern, but they were not listening attentively to him. Az-Zubayr sat

down with them, then he said: "Why do I see you not listening
attentively to the poetry of Ibn al-Furay'ah? The Messenger of Allah
(@) used to listen attentively to him, reward him generously and not
get distracted from him." Then Hassiin spoke in verse, praising azZubayr in many lines in which he described his great commitment to
Islam, his adherence to the way of the Messenger of Allah (eJ
and
his sacrifice and service for ~ s l a r n . ~ ~ ~

1.8.12. Generosity of az-Zubayr ibn alL'Aww5m
It was narrated that 'Urwah ibn az-Zubayr said: "Seven of the
Companions appointed az-Zubayr to be the guardian of their children
after they died, including 'Uthmiin, Ibn Mas'ood and 'AbdnrR&mi?n. He would spend on the heirs from his own wealth and
protect their wealth."432
This is an excellent example of generosity and sincerity that
embodies noble ideals that will have a strong impression on the heart
of every man of dignity. A person may show generosity time after
time and then tire of it, but for this generous man to be in charge of
spending on the heirs of many of the Companions and protecting
their wealth is a unique example in real life and an indication of the
sublime attitude that the Companions attained, may Allah be pleased
with them.433

1.8.13. The time has come to depart...
and the Prophet's testimony of entering paradise
Az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwh (&) left the Battle of the Camel
during the first round, for reasons that we have explained above.
When he left the battlefield, he was repeating these lines of poetry:
Giving up on things that I fear may have bad consequences,
for the sake of Allah, is better in both worldly and religious terms.

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

127

It was also said that he spoke the following lines of verse:

I know, and I hope that I will benefit from what I know,
that life is very close to death.434
After he left, he was followed by 'Amr ibn Jurmooz, FadGIah
ibn Hgbis and Nafee', along with a group of the evildoers of Banu
Tameem. It was said that when they caught up with him, they ganged
up on him and killed him; it was also said that the one who caught up
with him was 'Amr ibn Jurmooz. ' A m said to him: "I need
something from you." He said: "Come closer." The freed slave of azZubayr, whose name was 'Aytah said: "He has a weapon!" He said:
"Even so." So he came to him and started talking to him, and it was
time for prayer, so az-Zubayr said to him: "Let's pray." He said:
"Let's pray." Az-Zubayr (+$) went fornard to lead them both in
prayer, and ' A m ibn Jurmooz stabbed him and killed him. It was
also said that 'Amr caught up with him while he was taking a nap in a
valley that was known as Wadi as-Sibi', and he attacked and killed
him there. This is the most well-known version, and the poetry of his
wife '&&ah hint Zayd ibn 'Amribn Nufayl testifies to that. She was
the last of his wives; before him, she was married to 'Umar ibn alKhaggb, who left her a widow when he was killed. Before 'Umar, she
was married to Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr as-Siddeeq, who was also
killed and left her a widow. When ai-Zubayr was killed, she
eulogised him in beautiful verse.435
When ' A m ibn Jurmooz killed ai-Zubayr (&), he cut off his
head and brought it to 'Ali (&), thinking that this would bring him
closer to him. He asked for permission to enter, and 'Ali (&) said:
"Give the killer of Safiyyah's son (meaning az-Zubayr) the tidings of
heU." Then 'Ali said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah (g)
say:
'Each prophet had a disciple, and my disciple is a z - ~ u b a ~ r . " ' ~ ~ ~
When 'Ali (&) saw the sword of az-Znbayr, he said: "How often

It was said that
'Amr ibn Jurmooz killed himself during 'Ali's reign; it was also said
that he lived until Muscabibn az-Znbayr became governor of Iraq. He
hid from him, and it was said to Mus'ab: "'Amr ibn Jurmooz is here
and is in hiding. Do you want to capture him?" He said: "Let him
show himself, for he is safe. By Allah, I am not going to kill him in
retaliation for az-Zubayr, because he is too insignificant for me to
make him equal to a z - ~ u b a ~ r . " ~ ~ ~

The Prophet (
-,
g)
foretold that az-Zubayr would die as a
martyr. It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of
Allah (g)
was once atop Mount U?~udwhen the mountain shook.
The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Be still, for there is no one on you
but a Prophet, a Siddeeq and a martyr." On top of the mountain were
the Prophet @), Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmk, 'Ali, Talhah and azZubayr (may Allah be pleased with them).440~ n - ~ a w a said:
w i '"This
hadith represents one of the miracles of the Messenger of AUah (gs),
for he foretold that these people would be martyrs, and all of them,
except the I'rophet (g)
and Abu Bakr, died as martyrs. 'Umar,
'Uthmin, 'Ali, Tabah and az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with
them) were all killed unlawfully and died as martyrs. The deaths of
the first three are well known. Az-Zubayr was killed in Wadi asSib?, near Basra, as he was leaving the battlefield, not wanting to
fight. Talhah also withdrew from the battle because he did not want
to fight, but an arrow shuck him and killed him. It is proven that
whoever is killed unlawfully is a martyr."441 Ash-Sha'bi said: "I met
five hundred or more of the Companions who said: "Ali, 'Uthmih,
Talhah and az-Zubayr are in paradise."' Adh-Dhahabi said: "I say:
Because they are among the ten about whom it was testified that they
would be in paradise; they were present at Badr, they were among the
people who swore allegiance in the Pledge.of Radwh; and they were

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

129

among the foremost to embrace slam,^' of whom Allah said that He
is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. All four were
killed and were granted martyrdom, so we love them and we hate the
four who killed these four."443

1.8.14. Az-Zubayr's eagerness that his
debts should be paid off when he died
It was narrated that Abdullah ibn ai-Zubayr said: "On the day
of the Camel, az-Zubayr left instrnctions that I was to pay off his
debts. He said: 'If you have any difficulty in doing so, then seek help
from my Master.' By Allah, I did not understand what he meant until
I said: '0 my father, who is your Master?' He said: 'AUah is my
Master; I never had any difficulty paying a debt but I would say, "0
Master of az-Zubayr, pay it off on his behalf," and He paid it off.'
The debt that he owed was that a man would come to him and give
him some wealth as a trust, but ai-Zubayr would say: 'No; rather it is
a loan, for I fear that it may be lost.' When he was killed, he did not
leave behind any dinars or dirhams, but he had a piece of land. I sold
it and paid off his debts. The sons of az-Zubayr said: 'Share out our
inheritance.' I said: 'By Allah, I will not share it out among you until
I announce for four years during the hajj season: If anyone has a debt
owed by az-Zubayr, let him come to us so that we may pay it off."'
He made this announcement eveq year during the hajj season, then
when four years had passed, he shared it out among them. Az-Zubayr
had four wives, and each wife got 1,200,000. The total sum of his
wealth was 5 0 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 . ~The repott of Bukhari is to be understood
as refemng to the total of his wealth at the time of his death, which is
different from the surplus that was left four years later.445There was
a great deal of blessing in his estate,446and Allah (@) blessed his
land after he died; his debt was paid off, and his wealth increased a
great deal. From this story we learn a number of lessons:

130

The Battles of the Camel and Sifleen, and the issue of arbitration

(a) Az-Zubayr said to his son: "0 my son, if you have any difficulty
in doing so (paying off the debts), then seek help from my
Master." This is an example of his deeply-rooted certainty and
strong faith that resulted from sincere bust in Allah (&) and
turning to Him to meet his needs and relieve his distress. The
true believer firmly believes that everything is in the hands of
Allah (&). If he finds himself in hardship and distress, the first
thing that crosses his mind is Allah (g)
and how He dominates
and controls everything. Those created beings who may have
some connection to his situation are also in the hands of Allah
their hearts are in His hand, and He directs them as He
wills. So the believer turns to Allah (&) before anyone else and
asks Him (;gV;j) to meet his needs and relieve his distress. Then he
follows the principle of cause and effect that Allah ( B )has
made a means of reaching the desired results, while believing
that they are no more than means and that the One Who does and
decrees things is Allah (s).
He (&) is able to cause the means
to have no impact, so that they do not lead to the usual results.447

(s);

(b) Was ai-Zubayr (&) a wealthy man? From the text above, we
see that ai-Zubayr (&) was not one of the wealthy who were
known for their wealth. Instead, he felt a sense of hardship and
was concerned about the trusts and debts that he owed; he was
afraid that his land and property would not be sufficient to pay
off all that he owed. This text also shows us that Abdullah ibn
ai-Zubayr, like his father, was expecting that the debts would be
more than the wealth and land. When his father asked him: "Do
you think that what we owe will leave anything of our wealth?"
Abdullah could not answer him. If he was expecting anything
other than what his father was expecting, he would have given
him an answer to put his mind at rest at this critical moment, to
tell him that the matter was different from what he thought and
was expecting; however, he went along with his father in his

Xli ibn Abi Tilib

131

expectations. When az-Zubayr suggested seeking help from his
Master, Abdullah asked: "Who is your Master?', expecting him
to mention some individual whom he could ask for help.
No one can claim that AbduUah was not aware of his father's
wealth or did not know about his property, because at that time
Abdullah was thirty-five years old, and a man that old is a great
help to his father and knows all about his situation and his
wealth, especially if he is the oldest son. Az-Zubayr's question
to his son: "Do you think that what we owe will leave anything
of our wealth?", indicates that AbduUah was aware of his
father's situation and finances. Indeed, az-Zubayr stated that the
matter of paying off the debts was not easy, as he said: "Allah is
my Master; I never had any difficulty paying a debt but I would
say, '0 Master of az-Zubayr, pay it off on his behalf,' and He
paid it off."448
Another sign that az-Zubayr was not regarded as one of the rich
and wealthy, and that what he expected with regard to the
amount of his debts in comparison to his wealth was correct, is
the fact that Hakeem ibn Hiziim (&), the paternal cousin of azZubayr, met Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr and said to him: "I do not
think that you will be able to pay off all these debts. If you are
unable to pay any of them, come to me for help."449

A fourth point is that Abdullah ibn Ja'far, who was owed four
hundred thousand by az-Zubayr, came to Abdullah ibn azZubayr and said: "If you wish, I will leave it for you." Abdullah
ibn az-Zubayr said: "No." Abdullah ibn Ja'far said: "Then if yon
wish, you may leave it and pay later than others."450
This is testimony that two of the senior Companions expected
that the property of az-Znbayr would not be enough to pay off all
the debts that he owed, and that they regarded him as one who
needed help. Moreover, those two were close to az-Zubayr and

132

i

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

aware of his situation. One of them was Hakeem ibn @z%m,azZubayr's paternal cousin, the other was his maternal cousin,
because the mother of az-Zubayr was Safiyyah hint 'AbdulMuttalib,
..
the paternal aunt of the Messenger (g),
and he used to
deal with him, giving and taking, borrowing and entrusting.
These four points constitute evidence about which there is no
doubt that az-Zubayr (&) was not a wealthy man.451

(4)

There were many rumours about the wealth of az-Zuhayr
and how rich he was, and there was a great deal of talk about his
slaves and horses. In some sources, it says that he had a thousand
slaves and that the thousand slaves used to pay him land tax
every day, but that none of this wealth entered his house because
he used to give it all in
The famous Orientalist Will
Durant put the figure at ten thousand, saying: "Az-Znbayr
owned ten thousand slaves, and he added one thousand
horses."453 Of course, this smart Orientalist omitted the part that
says that he gave the land tax of his slaves in charity.454This
report cannot stand up to the report of Bukhari, in which it says:
"When az-Zubayr was killed, he did not leave behind any dinar
or dirham, but there was some land which included al-Ghiibah,
eleven houses in Madinah, two houses in Basra, a house in
Kufah and a house in ~

~The report

t is clear
.
and
" states
~
~
that he did not have anything except those properties, in the
context of talking about the distress caused by debt and
difficulties in seeking to pay it off.

If there were a thousand slaves, they would have been mentioned
and their value estimated; wasn't one slave worth at least two
thousand dirhams?456In that case, the value of the slaves alone
would have covered almost the entire debt, and that is if we
assume that there were only one thousand. If we go along with
the wild exaggeration of Will Durant, which suggests that there

~

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

133

were ten thousand slaves, this would mean rejecting Bukhari's
report completely, because ten thousand slaves and one
thousand horses, even if their price was low, would have been
enough to pay off his debts and drown his heirs in a sea of
wealth. Az-Zubayr would not have needed to say to his son,
"One of my greatest womes is my debt"; or to ask him, "Do you
think that what we owe will leave anything of our wealth?"; or
to instruct him, "If you have any difficulty in doing so (paying
off the debts), then seek help from my aster."^^^
Discussing the biographies of az-Zubayr, Tabah, 'Amr ibn al'AS, Ahu Moosa al-Ash'ari and the Mother of the Believers 'A'ishah
(may Allah be pleased with them all) is in harmony with the aim of
this book, which is to present the life and times of Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali ihn Ahi Taib (&). These individuals are regarded
as focal points in his life and times, and their biographies have been
distorted in history books and literary works that speak of internal
conflict and turmoil. It is essential to highlight their biographies,
character and attitudes so that the reader will come away with correct
knowledge and will not be influenced by weak reports or false stories
that were fabricated by the R Z d i Shia historians to distort the image
of these noble characters. Talking about the biography of az-Zubayr
and other senior Companions who contributed to the events that took
place during the lifetime of 'Ali (&)is in harmony with the author's
aims and what he wants to convey in his study of the era of the
Rightly Guided Caliphs.

Muslim at the hands of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (&) and one of the six
members of the consultative committee.462

1.9.1. His conversion to Islam,
persecution and migration
Tabah ibn 'Ubaydullah said: "I was at the marketplace in
Bu~ra,when a monk in his cell said: 'Ask the people of this gathering
whether there is among them any of the people of the sanctuary.'
Tabah said: 'Yes, me.' He said: 'Has m a d appeared yet?' I said:
'Who is Ahmad? He said: 'The son of Ahdullah ibn 'AbdulMnttalib. This is the month in which he will appear, and he is the last
of the prophets. He will appear in the sanctuary and will migrate to (a
place where there are) palm trees, lava fields and wet and salty land.
Beware lest others believe in him before you.' I was moved by what
he said, so I left quickly and came to Makkah. I asked: 'Is there any
news?' They said: 'Yes, Muhammad ibn Abdullah al-Ameen is
claiming to be a prophet, and Ibn Abi Q&%ah (Ahu Bakr) has
become his follower.' I went out and entered upon Ahu Bakr and
said: 'Have you become a follower of this man?' He said: 'Yes. Go to
him, enter upon him and follow him, for he is calling to the truth and
to goodness."' Tamah told Abu Bakr what the monk had said, and
Abu Bakr took h i to the Messenger of Allah (g).
Talhah became
Muslim and told the Messenger of Allah (&) about what the monk
had said, and the Messenger of AUah (%j was happy with that.

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

When Abu Bakr and Tabah ibn 'Ubaydullah (may Allah be
pleased with them both) became Muslim, Nawfal ibn Khuwaylid ibn
al-'Adawiyyah took them and tied them up with one rope, and Banu
Taym did not protect them. Nawfal was called 'the Lion of Quraysh';
hence Abu Bakr and Talhah were called 'the pair tied together'?63
Tallph was persecuted for the sake of Allah (&) and was severely
tortured by the polytheists and by his nearest kinsmen, but he (&)
persisted, patiently bearing the torture and persecution nntil Allah
(&) granted permission to migrate. When the Messenger of Allah
(B)set out to migrate to Madinah, he was met by Talhah, who was
coming from Syria with a caravan. He gave the Messenger of Allah
and Abn Bakr some Syrian garments, then went on to Makkah
where he finished up his trade. After that, he left with the family of
Abu Bakr (&) and brought them to Madinah. T a a h (&.) was one
of the earliest of those who migrated.464When he came & Madinah,

1.9.2. At the Battle of Badr

was expecting a caravan to come
to Quraysh from Syria, so he (g)
sent Talhah with Sa'eed ibn Zayd,
instructing them to find out where the caravan of Qnraysh was and to
bring him the news. They set out and reached al-Hawra', where they
stayed nntil they saw the caravan pass by and take the coastal route,
then they went back to Madinah with this news. The Messenger of
Allah (@) had set out with the Muslims on the campaign of Badr, so
they hastened to join the m y . They did not get there in time for the
battle, but the Messenger of Allah (g)
allocated to them a share of

1.9.3. At the Battle of Uhud
During this battle, Talhah performed a deed that made him
deserve paradise. It was narrated that Jibir said: "On the day of Uhud,
when the people fled, the Messenger of Allah (g)
was on his own in
some part of the battlefield with twelve men, including Talhah, and
the polytheists caught up with him. The Prophet (g)
said: 'Who will
confront these people?' Talhah said: 'I will.' He told him: 'Stay
where you are.' One of the Ansir said: 'I will,' and he fought until he
was killed. Then the Prophet (g)
turned and saw the polytheists and
said: 'Who will confront these people?' T a a h said: 'I will.' He told
him: 'Stay where you are.' One of the An$& said: 'I will,' and he
fought until he was killed. It continuedlike that until only Tabah was
left with the Prophet of AUah (B).
He said: 'Who will confront these
people?' Talhah said: 'I will.' Talhah fought like the eleven before
him, until his fingers were cut off, then be said: 'That's enough for
me.' The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'If you had said, "In the name
of Allah", the angels would have taken you up while the people were
looking on.' Then Allah (&) drove back the polytheists."468
According to Ahmad, the Prophet (g)
said to him: "If you had said
'In the name of Allah', you would have seen a house built for you in
paradise while you were still alive in this ~ o f l d . " ~ ~ ~
It was narrated that Qays ibn H k i m said: "I saw the paralysed
hand of Tabah, with which he had protected the Prophet (g)
on the
day of LJ?md."470During that battle, he received thirty-nine or
five wounds, and his fingers -the index finger and the one next to it
-were paralysed.471Abu Diwood at-Tay2isi narrated that 'A'ishah
(&) said: "When Abu Bakr remembered the day of Uhud, he would
say: 'That day was all for ~ a b a h . " ' ~It~ was
'
narrated that 'kishah
and Umm lshiq, the two daughters of T a a h , said: "Our father
received twenty-four wounds on the day of Uhud, among which was
a square cut on his head. His sciatic nerve was damaged and his

m-

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

137

fingers paralysed, the rest of the wounds were on his body. He fell
moved him
unconscious, and the Messenger of Allah (g)
backwards. Every time one of the polytheists drew near, Talhah
fought to defend the Prophet (g),
until his back was against the
mountain."473 The Prophet (g)
said: 'Talhah did a deed that made
paradise his due, when he did for the Messenger of Allah what he
did."474

1.9.4. A martyr walking on the face of the earth
It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (&) that the Messenger of
AUah (B)was once atop the mountain of m u d when it began
shaking. The Messenger of Allah (g)said: "Be still, for there is no
one on you but a Prophet, a Siddeeq and a martyr." On it were the
Prophet (g),
Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthm2n, 'Ali, Talhah, az-Zubayr
and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqiv (may Allah be pleased with them
After Talhah learned that he had been named as a martyr, that news of
glad tidings from the Beloved (B),he continued seeking his
martyrdom where it is usuaLly sought. Thus he was present at every
battle with the Prophet
except for ~ a d ras; we
~ have
~ ~ seen, he
missed that because he had been sent on a mission by the Messenger
of Allah (g).
The Prophet (g)
said concerning him: "Whoever
would like to see a martyr walking on the face of the earth, let him
look at Talhah ibn baydu dull ah."^^^

(a)

1.9.5. (Among the believers are men who have been
true to their covenant with Allah.) (Qw'an 33: 23)
It was narrated from Moosa and 'Eesa, the sons of Talhah,
from their father, that a Bedouin came and asked the Messenger of
AUah
about who those "who have fulfilled their obligations"478
were. They did not usually ask him such questions, out of respect and
awe. The Bedouin asked him, and the Prophet (@) turned away from

(e)

1

The Battles ofthe Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

him; he asked him again, and he turned away from him again. Ta&ah
said: "Then I came in from the door of the mosque, and I was wearing
a green garment. When the Messenger of Allah (B)saw me, he said:
'Where is the one who was asking about the one who fulfils his
obligation? The Bedouin said: 'It was me, 0 Messenger of Allah.'
He said: 'This is one of those who have fulfilled their obligation.'"479

1.9.6. Ta&ah's defence of his brothers
and his thinking positively of them
It was narrated that Maik ibn Abi 'Amir said: "A man came to
Tabah and said: 'What do yon think about this Yemeni (Abn
Hurayrah)? Is he more knowledgeable of the hadith of the Messenger
of Allah than you? We hear things from him that we do not hear from
you.' He said: 'As to whether he heard things from the Messenger of
Allah (g)
that we did not hear, there is no doubt about that. I will
explain to you: we were people with families, and we only came to
the Messenger of AUah in the morning and in the evening. But Abu
Hurayrah was a poor man with no wealth. He was the doorkeeper of
the Messenger of Allah (g),
so I do not doubt that he heard what we
did not hear. Do you think that anyone who has anything good in him
could fabricate things that the Messenger of AUah
did not

(a)

say?"480

1.9.7. Spending for the sake of Allah (s)
It was narrated that Qubaysah ibn J2bu said: "I accompanied
Talhah, and I have never seen anyone who could give more
generously without being asked than him."481 It was narrated from
Moosa from his father Talhah than when he received his share of
wealth from Hadramawt, seven hundred thousand, he was restless all
night and said: "What punishment could a man expect from his Lord
when he spent all night with this money in his house?" His wife said:

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

139

"How about some of your close friends? In the morning, call for
some bowls and share it out." He said to her: "May Allah have mercy
on you. Yon are a guided daughter of a guided one." (She was Urnm
Kulthoom, the daughter of Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq.) The next morning,
he called for some bowls and shared it out among the Muhijireen and
An!&, and he sent a bowl of it to 'Ali (&). Then T a a h ' s wife said
to him: "0 Abu Muhammad, don't we have a share of this wealth?"
He said: "Where have you been all day? You can keep what is left."
She said: "There was a bundle in which there was approximately one
thousand dirhams."482
It was narrated that Talhah's wife Su'da hint 'Awf alMuniyyah said: "I entered upon Talhah one day when he was
looking tired. I said: 'What is the matter with you? Are you upset
with your wife (meaning herself) at all?' He said: 'No, by Allah, what
a good wife for a Muslim you are. I have money that is making me
depressed.' I said: 'What is bothering you? Share it among your
people.' He said: '0 slave, call my people for me,' and he shared it
out among them. I asked the storekeeper: 'How much did he give?'
He said: 'Four hundred thousand."'483
It was narrated from al-Hasan al-Basri that Tabah ibn
'Ubaydullah sold some land of his for seven hundred thousand, and
he could not sleep all night because of fear of that wealth, until he
distributed it the next morning.484
It was narrated that 'Ali ibn Zayd said: "A Bedouin came to
Talhah to ask him for something, approaching him on the basis of his
ties of kinship. T a a h said: 'No one asked me on the basis of ties of
kinship before you. I have some land for which 'Uthmin offered me
three hundred thousand; go and take it, or if you wish, I can sell it to
'Uthmk and give you the money.' He said: '(
will
I take) the money,'
so he gave it to him. He (&) did not leave anyone among Banu
Taym poor; he would give him what he needed and pay off his debts.

called him 'the generous' because of his generous giving and
spending on good causes. Abu Abdullah al-H%m narrated, with his
chain of narration going back to Moosa ibn T a a h , that on the day of

1.9.8. Unique and beautiful sayings of Tabah
Among his sayings was: "The least shame for a man is his
staying at home."489 It was also narrated that he said: "Clothing
shows the blessings of Allah
and kind treatment of a servant
suppresses enemies."490 T a a h (&)
. ., had deep insight into people's
natures and qualities. He never consulted a miserly man when he
wanted to uphold ties of kinship with people, and he never consulted
a coward with regard to matters of war.491

1.9.9. Martyrdom of Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah (&)
On the day of the Battle of the Camel, after 'Ali (&) met and
talked to him,T a a h
withdrew and stood in one of the lines. A
stray arrow hit him on the knee; it was also suggested that it hit him
on his neck, but the former is better known. The arrow hit the side of
his horse as well as his leg, and the horse reared and nearly threw him
off. He started calling: "Come to me, slaves of Allah." A freed slave
of his caught up with him and rode behind him; he took him to Basra,
and T a a h (&) died in a house there. It was also suggested that he
died in the battle and that when 'Ali (&) walked among the slain, he
saw him and began to wipe the dust from his face,492saying: "It is
hard for me, 0 Abu Muhammad, to see you lying slain in these

(a)

valleys." According to this version, 'Ali (&) also said: '"To Allah I
complain of my sorrow and sadness;" he prayed for mercy for him
and said: "Would that I had died twenty years before this."493

(4)

Undoubtedly Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah
is one of the
people of paradise. At-Tirmidhi narrated, with his chain of narration
going back to 'Abdur-Ralpnin ibn 'Awf, that he said: "The
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'Abu Bakr will be in paradise, 'Umar
will be in paradise, 'Uthmin will be in paradise, 'Ali will be in
paradise, Ta&ah and Sa'd will be in paradise, Sa'eed will be in
paradise, Abu 'Ubaydah will be in paradise, az-Zubayr and 'AbdurR*m& ibn 'Awf will be in paradise."' Then he said: "This hadith
was narrated from 'Abdur-R*mh ibn Humayd from his father from
Sa'eed ibn Zayd from the Prophet ( s ) . " ~ ~This
~ hadith clearly
speaks of the virtue of Tabah (&), as the Prophet (B)testified that
he would be one of the people of paradise. What a sublime testimony
this is, for it tells of his being blessed in this world and in the
hereafter.495

1.9.10. Allah (&) preserved his body after he died
Allah (&) preserved the body of Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah
(&) after he died. His grave was opened more than thirty years later
so that they could move him to another place, and no part of him had
changed except for a few hairs on one side of his beard. It was
narrated that al-Muthanna ibn Sa'eed said: "A man came to 'A'ishah
bint Talhah and said: 'I saw Talhah in a dream, and he said: "Tell
'kishah to move me from this place, for the moisture or water is
bothering me."' So she rode with her entourage, and they erected a
tent over his grave and exhumed him. No part of him had changed
except for a few hairs on one side of his beard, or on his head. And
that was thirty-some years (after his death)."496 May Allah be
pleased with Talhah and all the Companions.

1.9.11. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqss prayed against
those who impugned 'Uthm2n 'Ali, T a a h and
az-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them all)
It was narrated from Sa'eed ibn al-Musiyib that a man used to
impugn Talhah, az-Znbayr, 'Uthmh and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased
with them). Sa'd told him to stop, saying: "Do not impugn my
brothers." The man refused to stop, so Sa'd stood up and prayed two
raka'ahs, then he said: "0AUah, if what he says displeases You, then
show me a sign today and make an example of him." The man went
out, and there was a camel driver going through crowds of people. A
camel stumbled on a stone and fell on him, and he was crushed to
death between the camel's chest and the ground. Sa'eed ibn alMusayyib said: "I saw the people following Sa'd and saying:
'Congratulations to yon, 0 Abu Ishiq, for your prayer was
answered.'"497

2. The Battle of Siffeen (37 AH)
2.1. Chain of events leading up to the battle
2.1.1. Umrn Habeebah bint Abi Sufycn (I&) sends
an-Nulm%n ibn Basheer with ' U W n f s chemise
to Mu'swiyah and the people of Syria
After 'Uthmin (A)was killed, the Mother of the Believers
Umm Habeebah bint ~ b Siu f y h (I&,) sent word to 'Uthmb's
family, saying: "Send me the garment in which 'Uthm2n was killed."
They sent her his bloodstained chemise, along with pieces of hair that
had been plucked kom his beard. Umm Habeebah called an-Nu'min
ibn Basheer and sent him to Mu'iwiyab, so he left carrying that and

i

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

143

her letter.498According to one report, an-Nu'm2n ibn Basheer took
with him the bloodstained chemise of ' U W and the fingers of
N2ilah that had been cut off when she tried to defend him with her
hand.499 N2ilah bint al-Farifisah d-Kdbiyyah was the wife of
'Uthmin (&), from the tribe of Kalb in ~yria.5"
An-Nu'm2n came to Mu'iwiyah (&) in Syria; Mu'gwiyah
placed him on the minbar so that the people could see him, and he
hung the fingers on the sleeve of the chemise, raising it sometimes
and lowering it sometimes. The people around him were weeping,
urging one another to seek vengeance.501Shur&beel ibn as-Samat
al-Kindi came and said to Mu'iwiyah: '"Utbm&~was our caliph. If
you are able to bring his murderers to justice, then do so; otherwise,
resign."50z The men of Syria swore that they would not be intimate
with their wives or sleep on their beds until they killed the murderers
of 'Uthm2n (&) and those who tried to prevent them from doing so,
or they died trying?03 This was what Mu'iwiyah wanted. The picture
that an-Nu'm2n ibn Basheer presented to the people of Syria was an
ugly one: the murder of the caliph, swords unsheathed by the thugs
and wielded over the people's necks, the public treasury plundered
and the fingers of N2'ilah cut off. The people were deeply moved;
their hearts were shaken and their eyes filled with tears. After this, it
is little wonder that the people's feelings ran high and that
Mu'iwiyah, and the people who were with him in Syria, insisted on
bringing the murderers of 'Uthmin (&) to justice. They wanted the
murderers to be handed over for retaliatory punishment before they
would agree to swear allegiance. Can we imagine the caliph and
leader of the Muslims being murdered by haters and conspirators
who had come from outside Madinah and taken over the city, and the
Muslim world not becoming outraged and sending demands from the
farthest comers of the Islamic regions for the perpetrators of this
heinous crime to be brought to justice?504

144

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

2.1.2. Mu'swiyah's motives for
not swearing allegiance
Mu'iwiyah (&) had been the governor of Syria during the
caliphates of 'Umar and 'Uthmh. When 'Ali
was appointed as
caliph, he wanted to dismiss Mu'iwiyah and appoint Abdullah ihn
'Umar in his place, but Ibn 'Umar apologised and declined the post.
'Ali (&) sent Sahl ibn Hunayf instead, but he had hardly reached the
border of Syria (Wadi alQura) when he was met by Mu'gwiyah's
cavalry under the leadership of Habeeb ibn Maslamah al-Fihri, who
said to him: "If you have been sent by 'Uthmiin, then you are
welcome, but if you have been sent by anyone else, then go back."505
He turned around and went back.

(a)

Mu'iwiyah and the people of Syria refused to swear allegiance
to 'Ali (&). They thought that 'Ali (&) should bring the murderers
of 'Uthmau (&) to justice first, and then they would swear
allegiance to him.'06 They said: "We will not swear allegiance to one
who gives refuge to the murderer^."^^' They feared for their lives
because of the murderers of 'Uthrnih (&)
. . who were in 'Ali's army;
his killers were in 'Ali's camp, and they were powerful. They thought
that swearing allegiance to 'Ali (&) was not obligatory for them and
that if they fought him, they would be the ones who were being
wronged because 'Uthmh (&) had been killed wrongfully,
according to the consensus of the Muslims. They said: "If we swear
allegiance, they will wrong us and transgress against us, and the
blood of 'Uthmh will go unavenged."
Mu'iwiyah (&) was related to 'Uthmiin, and he thought that
it was 'Ali's duty to stand up for 'Uthmin and bring to justice those
who had killed him. Allah (&) says: BAnd whoever is killed
wrongfully [Mazl2iman intentionally with hostility and oppression
and not by mistake], We have given his heir the authority [to demand
QisLis, - Law of Equality in punishment - or to forgive, or to take

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

145

Diyah (blood money)]. But let him not exceed limits in the matter of
taking life [i.e. he should not kill except the killer]. Verily, he is
helped [by the Islamic 1awI.B (Qur2an17: 33)
Hence MuC2wiyahbrought the people together and addressed
them concerning 'Uthmh's case, stating that he had been killed
unlawfully at the hands of foolish hypocrites who did not respect
sacred blood (referring to blood that was protected by Sharia); they
had shed his blood during the sacred month in the sacred land. The
people were agitated, and their voices grew loud in denouncing the
murder of 'Uthmin (&). Among them were a number of the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah ( g ) . One of them, whose
name was Murrah ibn Ka'b, stood up and said: 'Were it not for a
hadith I heard from the Messenger of Allah (gJ,
I would not have
spoken. The Prophet &) mentioned the turmoil and gave some
details concerning it. Then a man passed by whose face was covered
with a cloth, and the Prophet ( g ) said: 'This man will be following
true guidance at that time.' I went up to him and found that he was
'Uthmh ihn 'Affk. I turned to the Prophet
and asked: 'This
man?' He (g)
said:

(s)

There is another hadith that had an effect on the pursuit of
justice for the killers of 'Uthm2n (&); it motivated Mu'2wiyah and
his followers and strengthened their resolve to achieve this goal. It
was narrated from an-Nu'mh ihn Basheer that 'k'ishah (@)
said:
i
"The Messenger of Allah (@) sent for 'Uthmiin ibn 'Aff2n. He came,
and the Messenger of Allah ( g ) turned to him. The last words he
said, when tapping his. shoulder, were: '0 'Uthmgn, Allah may clothe
you with a chemise which, if the hypocrites want you to take it off, do
not take it off until you meet me.' He said it three times." I [anNu'mk] said to her: "0Mother of the Believers, why did you not tell
us this before?" She said: "I forgot it, and by Allah I did not
remember it." He said: "I told MuC2wiyahibn Abi Sufyin about it,

146

f i e Battles of the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

and he did not like what I told him. He wrote to the Mother of the
Believers, asking her to write to him about it, and she wrote a letter to
him about it.'09
This great keenness to implement the ruling of Allah ( B )on
the murderers was the main reason for the refusal of the people of
Syria, led by Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi Sufyh (&), to swear allegiance to
'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&). They thought that implementiug the ruling
of retaliation took precedence over swearing allegiance. It was not a
matter of Mu'iwiyah's having ambitions in Syria or his demanding
something that was not rightfully his; he fully understood that the
issue of caliphate was limited to whoever was left of the six members
of the consultative committee, and that 'Ali (&) was superior to him
and more entitled to it than he was.510However, allegiance had been
sworn to 'Ali on the basis of the consensus of the Companions in
Madinah, so Mu'iwiyah's view was contrary to what was correct.

2.1.3. Mu'gwiyah (&) responds to
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tglib (4)
'Ali (&) sent letters to Mu'iwiyah (&), but he did not
respond. This happened several times in the hrst few months after the
,.
then Mu'iwiyah sent a man to take a letter
murder of 'Uthmh (&),
to 'Ali (&) in the month of Safar. 'Ali (&) said to him: 'Tell me
what you have for me." He said: "I bave come to you from people
who do not want anything but the $add punishment for the
murderers, and each of them is seeking vengeance. I bave left behind
sixty thousand men who are weeping in front of 'UthmWs chemise,
which is on the minbar of Damascus." 'Ali (&) said: "0 Allah, I
declare my innocence before You of the blood of 'Uthrnh." As the
envoy of Mu'iwiyah left 'Ali (&), some of those rebels who had
killed 'Uthmh (&) tried to kill him, and he only escaped with

2.1.4. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali's preparations for the
march to Syria, and al-Hasan's objection to that
After Mu'iwiyah's response reached Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali, the caliph decided to fight the people of Syria. He wrote to Qays
ibn Sa'd in Egypt, instrncting him to mobilise people to fight them,
and he sent similar instructions to Abu Moosa in Kufah and to
'Uthmk ibn Hunayf. He addressed the people, urging them to join
the fight, and he started to make preparations. He was determined to
fight with those who obeyed him against those who disobeyed him
and did not swear allegiance to him. His son al-Hasan ihn 'Ali came
to him and said: "0 my father, do not do this, because it involves
shedding the blood of the Muslims and creating division among
them." 'Ali (&)
. . did not accept that from him, though; he insisted on
fighting. He organised the army, giving the banner to Muhammad ihn
al-Banafiyyah and putting Ibn 'Ahhb in charge of the right flank and
'Umar ibn Abi Salamah in charge of the left. It was also said that he
put 'Arnr ibn Sufyin ihn 'Abdul-Asad in charge of the left flank and
Abu Layla ihn 'Umar ibn al-Jarrih, his nephew, in charge of the
vanguard. He appointed Qutham ibn 'Ahbis to he in charge of
Madinah in his absence, and there was nothing left to do except to
leave Madinah and bead for Syria, when something happened to
distract him from that.''' We have. discussed in detail bow 'A'ishah,
Tabah and az-Znbayr went out to Basra and the Battle of the Camel.

2.1.5. After the Battle of the Camel,
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (A&) sent
Jareer ibn Abdullah to Mu'Swiyah
It is said that the period between the appointment of Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) to the caliphate and the second Saba'i fitnah,
which is called Basra or the Battle of the Camel, was five months and
twenty-one days. Between that and his entering Kufah was one

148

The Battles of the Camel a d Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

month, and between his entering Kufah and his going out to Siffeen
was six months,513or it was said that it was two or three months.514
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) entered Kufah on Monday, 12
Rajab 36 AH. It was suggested to him that he should stay in the white
palace, but he said: "No, 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b (&) would not like
to stay there, so I dislike it too." He stayed in ar-Ratah and prayed
two raka'ahs in the great mosque, then he addressed the people,
urging them to do good and forbidding them from doing evil. He
praised the people of Kufah in his speech, then be sent word to Jareer
ibn Abdnllah, who had been the governor of Hamadhiin from the
time of 'Uthmh, and al-Asb'ath ibn Qays, who had been governor of
Azerbaijan from the time of 'Uthmk (&), telling them to accept the
oath of allegiance to him from the people there, then to come to him,
and they did that.

(a)

When 'Ali (&) wanted to send word to Mu'iiwiyah
calling on him to swear allegiance to him, Jareer ibn Ahdullah alBaj& said: "I will go to him, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, for there was
friendship between me and him, and I will accept his oath of
allegiance to you." Al-Ashtar said: "Do not send him, 0 Amir alMu'mineen, for I fear that he is inclined towards him." 'Ali (&)
said: "Let him be," and he sent him with a letter to Mu'iwiyah. The
letter told him that there was consensus among the Muhiijireen and
An$%on swearing allegiance to 'Ali (&), informed him of what had
happened at the Battle of the Camel, and called on him to join the
people in swearing allegiance. When Jareer ibn Abdullah reached
Mu'iwiyah and gave him the letter, Mu'iwiyah summoned ' A m ihn
al-'AS and the leaders of the people of Syria and consulted them.
They refused to swear allegiance to 'Ali (&) until the murderers of
'Uthmin (&) were executed or handed over to them. They said that
if 'Ali (&) did not do that, they would not swear allegiance to him,
and they would fight to the last man.

149

Jareer went hack to 'Ali (&) and told him what they had said.
Al-Ashtar said: "Did I not tell you, 0 Amir d-Mu'mineen, not to
send Jareer? If you had sent me, Mu'iwiyah would not have opened
any door hut I would have closed it." Jareer said to him: "If you had
gone there, they would have killed you in retaliation for 'Uthmin."
Al-Ashtar said: "By Allah, if you had sent me, I would have found an
answer to Mu'iwiyah's questions, and I would have given him an
answer before he even asked. If Amir d-Mu'mineen had listened to
me, he would have detained you and others like you until the affairs
of this Ummah were straightened out." Jareer got up angrily and
went to stay in Qarqaysa'. He mote to Mu'iwiyah, telling him what
he had said and what had been said to him; Mu'iwiyah wrote hack,
telling him to come to himhi' Thus al-Ashtar was a factor in the
alienation of the Companion Jareer ihn Ahdullah, who was 'Ali's
governor in Qarqaysa' and elsewhere, and the leader of his tribe
Bajeelah. This Companion, Jareer ihn Ahdullah al-Bajali said: "The
Messenger of Allah (g)
never saw me without smiling at me." The
Prophet (g,)
said concerning him: "There will enter upon you from
this door a man who is the best of those who are blessed; on his face
there is an angelic

2.1.6. 'Ali's march to Syria

huge army; the reports differ concerning the size, hut they are all
weak reports"' apart from one with a reliable chain of narration,

2.1.7. Mu'gwiyah's going out to Siffeen
Mn'iwiyah was serious about bringing the murderers of
'Uthmk (&) to justice. He managed to ambush and kill a group of
Egyptians who had invaded Madinah, including Abu 'Amr ihn
Bndayl al-Khuzfi'i, as they were returning to ~ ~ ~ p tMoreover,
. 5 ' ~ he
had supporters in Egypt and among the people of Kharbata who were
also seeking vengeance for the murder of 'Utbmk (&). This group
managed to defeat Muhammad ihn Ahi Hudhayfah a number of
confrontations in 36 AH. Mu'fiwiyah also managed to capture the
Egyptian leaders and planners of the invasion of Madinah, such as
'Ahdur-Ralpnk ihn 'Udaysi, Kinkah ihn Bishr and Muhammad ihn
Hudhayfah, whom he detained in Palestine during the period that
preceded his going out to Siffeen. He executed them in Dhul-Hijjah
36 AH?" When Mu'iwiyah learned of the movements of the Iraqi
army, he gathered his consultants among the prominent people of
Syria and addressed them, saying: 'Ali is coming towards yon with
the people of Iraq." Dhul-Kil2' al-JJimyari said: '"Tell us what to do,
and we will do it."528
"

The people of Syria gave their pledge to Mu'iwiyah that they
would fight to seek vengeance for the murder of 'Uthmk (&)?29

I

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

'Amr ibn al-'AS (&)
,.
prepared the army and appointed commanders,
and he stood up to address and encourage the army, saying: "The
people of Iraq are divided and weak. The people of Basra are opposed
to 'Ali because he killed some of them, and the strongest of the
people of Kufah were killed in the Battle of the Camel. 'Ali is
marching with a small group, among whom are those who killed your
caliph, so do not fail in your duty to bring them to justice."530
Mu'iiwiyah set out with a huge army. Reports differ on the
number, but they all have interrupted chains of narration; they are the
same reports that estimated the size of 'Ali's army. The number was
put at one hundred and twenty thousand,531or seventy thousand, or
much more than that.532The closest to the truth is a report that they
numbered sixty thousand. Although the chain of narration of this
report is interrupted, its narrator is Safw2n ibn 'Amr as-Saksi, a
Homsi from Syria who was born in 72 AH and is proven to be
trustworthy. He met a number of those who had been present at
Siffeen, as is clear from studying his biography.533 The chain of
narration to him is
The commanders of Mu'2wiyah's army were as follows: 'Am
ibn al-'AS in charge of the entire cavalry of Syria; ad-l?a&% ibn
Qays in charge of the entire infantry; Dhul-Kilii' al-Himyari in charge
of the right flank of the army; Habeeb ibn Maslamah in charge of the
left flank,and Abu al-A'war as-Sulami in charge of the vanguard.
These were the senior commanders; with each of these commanders,
there were other officers, organised along tribal lines. They marched
to Siffeen in this order, but during the battle, some of the
commanders were changed and other commanders appointed, as
dictated by circumstances. This may be the reason for the differences
concerning the names of the commanders in some
Mu'iiwiyah sent Abu al-A'war as-Sulami in the vanguard of
the army, and their route led northeast from Damascus. When he

152

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue ofarbitration

reached Siffeen, by the lower part of the Euphrates, he camped in a
vast plain beside a branch of the Euphrates; in that place there was no
other branch on the river. so he made it his

2.1.8. The fight for the water
The army of 'Ali (&) reached Siffeen, where Mu'iwiyah
(&) was already camping. 'Ali (&) could not find sufficient level
ground for the army, so they camped in a place that was somewhat
rugged, on land that was mostly covered with jagged
His
army was caught by surprise when Mu'iwiyah prevented them from
reaching the water, and some of them rushed to complain to 'Ali
about that. He sent d-Ash'ath ibn Qays out with two thousand
men, and the first battle took place between the two sides. Al-Ash'ath
was victorious and gained control of the water.538

(4)

Mowever, there is a repoa denying that any fighting took place at all.
This report says that d-Ash'ath ibn Qays went to Mu'iwiyah and
said: "I urge you by Allah, 0 Mu'iwiyah, to think of the Ummah of
Muhammad (g)!
Suppose you kill the people of Iraq. Who will
guard the border and the women and children? Allah (&) says: (And
if two paaies [or groups] among the believers fall to fighting, then
make peace between them both.8 (Qur'an 49: 9 ) Mu'iwiyah said:
"What do you want?' They said: "Let us reach the water." He said to
Abu d-A'war: "Let our brothers reach the water.")539
The fight for the water took place on the first day they met at
the beginning of Dhul-IJijjah, and this was a had start for both parties
of Muslims, because fighting continued between them for the entire
month. The fighting took the form of encounters between small
groups. 'Ali (4)
would send out a small group led by a commander,
and it would engage in fighting once a day, either in the morning or
the afternoon; on a few occasions they fought twice in a day. On most
occasions, the commanders in 'Ali's army who would go out with

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

153

small groups to fight were al-Ashtar, Hajar ibn 'Adiyy, Shabath ibn
Rab'i, Kh2lid ibn al-Mu'tamir and Ma'qil ihn Yas& ar-Riy& In
Mu'iwiyah's army, those who went out most often were Habeeb ibn
Maslamah, ' A b d u r - R b 2 n ibn Kh2lid ibn al-Waleed, 'Ubaydullah
ihn 'Umar ihn al-Kha@b, Abu al-A'war as-Sulami and Sbur&beel
ibn as-Samat. They avoided fighting with the entire army for fear of
complete destruction and rnin of the Ummah, and in the hope of
reaching a peace deal between the two sides whereby loss of lives
and bloodshed could be avoided.540

2.1.9. Cooling off and attempts at reconciliation
No sooner had the month of M&arram begun than the two
sides hastened to suspend the fighting and call for a truce, in the hope
of reconciliation that would protect Muslim lives. They took
advantage of this month to correspond with one another, hut the
information about the correspondence during this period - the
month of Muhmam -was narrated via weak but well-known chains
of narrati~n?~'
The fact that they are weak does not mean that it did
not take place, though. The one who started the correspondence was
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&). He sent Basheer ibn
'Amr al-AnsZ, Sa'eed ibn Qays al-Hamad2ni and Shabath ibn Rab'i
at-Tameemi to Mu'iwiyah (&), calling on him as he had before to
join the main body of Muslims and swear allegiance to 'Ali.
Mu'iwiyah responded in the same manner as he had previously,
demanding that 'Ali hand over 'Uthmk's killers or bring them to
justice before he would give him his oath of allegiance. We have
already discussed 'Ali's attitude concerning this matter?42

large number, had camped in an area separate from Siffeen. Tbey

the Companions, Abu ad-Dard2 and Abu U m h a h , also tried to
reconcile the two parties but were not able to, for the same reasons;
they abandoned both parties and did not get involved in this issue of
fighting?& Masrooq ibn al-Ajda', one of the senior Tibi'oon, also
came and exhorted them and told them to fear Allah (&), but he did
not fight.545
Ibn Katheer criticised the lengthy details that were narrated in
reports of Abu Makhnaf and Nasr ibn Muz%im with regard to the
correspondence between the two sides. He said: "...Then the
biographers mentioned a lengthy discussion that took place between
them and 'Ali. The soundness of this material is subject to further
examination. In the reports, there are some words which are
attributed to 'Ali in which there is criticism of MuC2wiyahand his
father; it says that they entered Islam but still had some doubts about
it, and other things that undermine Mu'iwiyah. It also says that 'Ali
said concerning that: 'I do not say that 'Uthm2n was killed
unlawfully or lawfully.' In my view, this cannot be soundly
attributed to 'Ali (&)."546
The attitude of 'Ali (&) concerning the murder of 'Uthmh
(&) is quite clear. I have discussed it in my book about 'Uthmin ibn
'Affan (4)
and in the present volume.

2.2. Outbreak of fighting
Fighting resumed after the sacred months, in the month of
Dhnl-Hidah, with encounters between battalions, groups and
individuals, for fear of all-out fighting taking place. More than
twenty skirmishes had taken place between the two sides during the
first week of Dbul-Hijjah; it was also said that the number was
ninety?47 'Ali (&) announced to his m y that on the next day,
Wednesday, there would be an all-out battle involving the entire
army; then he sent word to Mu'iwiyah informing him of that.548That

night, the people rnshed to repair and sharpen their weapons. 'Amr
ibn al-'As brought weapons out of storage for those whose weapons
had worn out and who needed them, and he encouraged people to be
steadfast in fighti11g.5~~Both armies spent the night planning and
organising the commanders and banners.

2.2.1. The first day of the battle
On Wednesday morning, the two armies had organised their
ranks in the manner followed in major battles, with a core, a right
flank and a left flank.
'Ali's army was organised in the following manner:550 'Ali ibn
Abi T Z b (&) was in charge of the core, Abdullah ibn 'AbbL was
in charge of the left flank, 'Ammir ibn Y b i r was in charge of the
infantry, Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah was carrying the flag,
H i s h h ibn 'Utbah (al-Marqiil) was carrying the banner and alAsh'ath ibn Qays was in charge of the right flank.
As for the Syrian army, Mu'iwiyah was in charge of the ashShahba' battalion, with their helmets and shields, on a hill, and he
was the commander of the army; 'Amr ibn d-'& was in charge of
the entire Syrian cavalry; Dhul-Kili' al-Wmyari was in charge of the
right flank, which was composed of Yemeni troops; qabeeb ibn
Maslamah al-Fihri was in charge of the left flank, which was
composed of Mudar tribesmen; and al-Makhkiq ibn as-Saba alKili'i was the banner
The two Muslim armies faced one another, filling the horizon
with their vast numbers. Ka'b ibn Jn'ayl at-~a~hlibi,'~'
one of the
Arab poets, said when he saw the people on Tuesday night, rushing
to mend their arrows and swords in preparation for battle:
This Ummah is in a very odd situation;
power will belong tomorrow to the one who prevails.

156

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

I shall say something true, not a lie:
tomorrow prominent Arabs are going to die.553

Some weak reports say that 'Ali (&) addressed his troops and
urged them to be patient and courageous, and to remember Allah
(g)
a great deal.554They also say that 'Amr ibn al-'AS inspected his
troops and instructed them to straighten their ranks.555There is no
reason not to accept these reports, because all commanders
encourage and motivate their troops and pay attention to anything
that may lead to victory. The two armies met in a violent conflict that
remained intense until sunset, and they only stopped to offer the
prayers. Each group prayed in its own camp, with the bodies of the
slain in the battlefield between them. When 'Ali (&) finished
praying, one of his troops asked him: "What do you say about our
dead and their dead, O Amir d-Mu'mineen?" He said: "Whoever has
been killed among us and them, seeking the countenance of Allah
and the home of the hereafter will enter paradise."556The two armies
stood fum, and neither prevailed; no one was seen fleeing until that
day ended. In the evening, 'Ali (&) went out to the battlefield and
looked at the people of Syria, and he called upon his Lord, saying: "0
Allah, forgive me and them."557

2.2.2. The second day
On Thursday, the reports say that 'Ali (&) prayed the dawn
prayer when it was still quite dark. He prepared to attack, and he
changed some of his commanders. He put Abdullah ibn Budayl alKhuzs'i in charge of the right flank instead of d-Ash'ath ibn Qays alKindi, whom he moved to the left flank.558The two parties marched
towards one another and engaged in fighting that was even more
intense than the day before. The people of lraq began to advance, and
they started to gain the upper hand over the people of Syria. Ahdullah
ibn Budayl managed to penetrate Mu'2wiyah's left flank, which was

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

157

led by Habeeb ibn Maslamah, and he advanced towards
Mu'iiwiyah's battalion (ash-Shahba'), demonstrating unparalleled
courage and zeal. This partial advance was accompanied by a general
advance of the Iraqi army, until Mu'iiwiyah thought of leaving the
battlefield, but be stood firm and urged his batralion asbShahba' to
do likewise. They managed to kill Abdullah ibn Budayl, who was
replaced by Al-Ashtar as commander of the right flank.
The people of Syria stood firm, and some of them swore to
fight to the death. They attacked again with firm resolve, and a
number of them were killed, the most prominent of whom were
Dhul-Kilii', Hawshab and 'Ubaydnllah ibn al-Kha@b (&).
. . Then
the balance tipped in favour of the Syrian army, and they gained the
upper hand, while the Iraqi army started to fall back, with many of
them being killed and wounded. When 'Ali (&)
.. saw that his army
was falling back, he began calling out to them and encouraging them.
He fought fiercely, aiming for the core where the Rabee'ah tribe was.
They were incensed by this, and their commander Khzlid ibn alMu'tamir swore to fight to the death, for they were people who
excelled at fighting.559
'Ammk ibn Y%ir (&), who was over ninety-four years old,

fought fiercely and encouraged and motivated the people to do
likewise, but he was far removed from extremism. He heard a man
next to him saying: "The people of Syria have become disbelievers."
'Ammk rebuked him for saying that and said: "Rather they have
transgressed against us, and we are fighting them because of their
transgression. Our God is One, our Prophet is one, and our qiblah is
one."560
When 'Ammi% (4)
saw his companions falling back and his
opponents advancing, he started encouraging them and telling them
that they were in the right and should not be deceived by the heavy
blows of the Syrians. He (&) sajd: "Whoever would like the hoor

'een ('firm-breasted' women with beautiful eyes, promised to male
believers in paradise) to surround him, let him advance between the
ranks, seeking reward with Allah, for I can see that the Syrians are
fighting us so fiercely that it may create doubt in the minds of some.
By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if they pushed us back until
they made us reach SaCf2tHajar, we would still believe that we are in
the right and they are in the wrong; we would still believe that our
righteous people are in the right, and they are the wrong."561Then he
began to advance with a spear in his hand, trembling because of old
age. He was urging the banner carrier Hbhim ibn 'Utbah ibn Abi
W a q q i ~to advance and seek the blessings that are with Allah ( B ) ,
and encouraging his companions too, saying: "Paradise is close at
hand, and the hoor 'een are adorned. Whoever would l i e to be
surrounded by the hoor 'een, let him advance between the ranks,
seeking the reward of Allah
This was a moving scene, for he
was a great Companion who had been present at Badr. He was over
ninety-four years of age and possessed great zeal, resolve, high
morale and strong faith. He was an important factor in the enthusiasm
of the Iraqi army and in raising their morale, which made them
tougher and fiercer and willing to sacrifice until they managed to tip
the balance in their favour. Hishim ibn 'Utbah ibn Abi Waqqis
advanced as 'Amm21 was saying: "Advance 0 H i s h h , for paradise
lies in the shade of the swords, and death is at the edges of the spears;
the gates of heaven are open and the hoor 'een are adorned. Today I
will meet my loved ones, Muhammad and his companions."56z

(s)."

When the sun set that Thursday, 'Ammk asked for a drink of
milk, then he said: 'The Messenger of Allah (g)
said to me: 'The last
drink you will drink in this world will be a drink of milk."'563 Then
he advanced and urged the banner carrier Hishim ibn 'Utbah ibn Abi
Waqqis az-Zuhri to advance with him, and neither of them came
back; both were slain.564May Allah have mercy on them and be
pleased with them.

2.2.3. The night of clamor and Friday
Fighting resumed the same night, with energy that had not
been seen before. The people of Iraq fought with enthusiasm and
high spirits until they pushed the people of Syria back from their
positions. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) fought fiercely and pledged
to fight to the death.565It was said that 'Ali (&) led his army in
praying the fear prayer at the time of sunset.566Ash-Sh2fa'i said: "It
was narrated from 'Ali (&) that he offered the fear prayer on the
night of clamor."567
An eyewitness said: "We fought for three days and three
nights until the spears were broken and the arrows ran out, then we
started using swords. We battled until the middle of the night, until
we reached the point of hand to hand combat. When the swords
became like sickles, we started hitting one another with pieces of
iron, and we could hear nothing except the grunting and groaning of
the people. Then we threw stones at one another, threw dust at one
another, and bit one another with our teeth until morning came on
Friday and the sun rose, although it could not be seen because of the
dust of battle. The banners and flags fell, and the army was worn out;
our hands were exhausted, and ow throats were dry."568
Ibn Katheer said, describing the night of clamor and the
following Friday: "They started fighting one another, and two men
would fight until they were exhausted. Then they would sit down to
rest, each one grunting at the other; then they would get up and fight
again. To AUah we belong, and unto Him is our return. They
continued like that until Friday morning came, and the people prayed
the dawn prayer with gestures while still fighting, until it became
very light outside, and the people of Iraq began to gain the upper
hand over the people of ria."^^^

2.2.4. The call for arbitration
After the night of clamor, the two armies found themselves in
such a state that they could not withstand any more fighting. AlAsh'ath ibn Qays, the leader of Kindah, addressed his companions
after the night of clamor and said: "0 Muslims, you have seen what
happened yesterday and how many of the Arabs were killed. By
Allah, I have reached old age as AUah willed, and I have never seen
anything like this. Let those who are present tell those who were
absent. If we resume fighting tomorrow, that will be the end of the
Arabs, and there will be no one left to protect what is sacred. By
Allah, I am not saying this for fear of fighting, but I am an old man,
and I fear that there will be no one to protect the women and children
if we all die tomorrow. 0 Allah, You know that my intention is to do
what is best for my people and my co-religionists, and I have not
fallen short."57o
News of that reached Mu'iwiyah, who said: "He is right, by
the Lord of the Ka'bah. If we meet in battle tomorrow, the Byzantines
will attack our women and children, and the Persians will attack the
people of Iraq and their children. Only those with wisdom and
understanding can see that." Then he said to his companions: "Tie
the mushafs to the ends of the spears."571 This is an Iraqi report in
which there is no mention of 'Amr ibn al-'As or any trick or deceit;
rather it was the desire of both parties. Neither Mu'iiwiyah nor 'Amr
would be harmed if one of them had the courage to take this initiative
and save what was left of the strength of this Ummah that was
fighting itself. It was only the Saba'is who were upset by that; they
had started this turmoil, and they left for us a pile of misleading
r e p o ~ which

They attributed to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) words that he
did not say and that were contrary to what is mentioned in the sound
reports. They attributed to him the words, "They never held it in high
esteem, and they will never act upon it; they have only raised it as a
trick and a plot to appease
One of the obscene things that they
said about the lifting up of the mushafs was: "This is the idea of the
son of the promiscuous woman."574 They also widened the circle of
propaganda against 'Amr ibn al-'As (&), to the extent that you can
hardly find any book of history that does not contain words
undermining 'Amr ibn al-'A$ and claiming that he was a trickster and
plotter; this is because of the fabricated reports made up by the
enemies of the noble Companions and transmitted by at-Tabari, Ibn
al-Atheer and others. Many contemporary historians, such as Hasan
Ibraeem Hasan in Tareekh al-Islam, Muhammad al-Khudari Beg in
Tareekh ad-Dawlah al-Urnawiyyah, 'Abdul-Wahh2b an-Najj2r in
Tareekh al-Khulafa' ar-Rcishideen and others were fooled by them
and played a role in distorting the historical facts.
The report of Abu Makhnaf suggests that 'Ali (&) rejected
the idea of refening to the Qur'an for judgement when it was first
suggested by the people of Syria, then he accepted it due to pressure
from the worshippers who later became known as ~ h a r i j i t e sThis
.~~~
report suggests that 'Ali (&) slandered Mu'iwiyah and his
companions, which is beneath the people of that blessed generation,
so how about their leaders, foremost among whom was Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&)?It is sufficient reason to reject the report that it
was narrated by the R a d i fabricator Abu Makhnaf. It is a report that
cannot stand up to unbiased review, and it cannot stand before other
reports whose narrators cannot be accused of bias, such as that which
was narrated by Imam A b d ibn Hanbal via Habeeb ibn Abi Thibit,
who said: "I came to Abu Wi'il, one of the men of 'ALi ibn Abi Tilib,
and he said: 'We were in Siffeen, and when many of the people of

162

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

Syria were killed, 'Amr said to MuC2wiyah:"Send the mushaf to
'Ali, and call him to the Book of Allah; he will not refuse." A man
brought the mu~hafto 'Ali and said: "Between us and you is the
Book of Allah: 4Have you not seen those who have been given a
portion of the Scripture? They are being invited to the Book of Allah
to settle their dispute, then a party of them turn away, and they are
averse8 (Qur'an 3: 23)." 'Ali (&) said: "Yes, I should be the first to
accept that." The worshippers - those who rebelled later on and
became h o w n as Khaijites - stood up with their swords on their
shoulders and said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, shouldn't we keep on
fighting these people until Allah decides the matter between us and
them?" Sahl ihn Hunayf al-Ans2ri (&) stood up and sajd: "0
people, you should be suspicious of your motives. We were with the
Messenger of Allah (B)
on the day of Hudaybiyah, and if we had the
opportunity to fight, we were ready to fight." He was referring to the
peace deal that was drawn up between the Messenger of Allah (g)
and the polytheists. Then he told them about 'Umar's objection to the
treaty on the day of Hudaybiyah and the revelation of Soorat al-Fath
to the Messenger of Allah (gJ.
'Ali said: "0 people, this is a
victory." 'Ali accepted the offer and went hack, and the people went
hack too."'576
Sahl ibn Hunayf (&) expressed his annoyance with those
who called for continuing the war between brothers, saying: "0
people, you should he suspicious of your
He explained
to them that there was no option except dialogue and a peace deal,
because the alternative was ongoing internal conflict, the
consequences of which no one knew. He said: "Before this,
whenever we went out to fight for a cause, we were certain of the
result and how far we would go with it; we do not h i s h with one
opponent but another opponent appears to us, and we do not h o w
how to deal with him."578 In these sound reports is a refutation of
those who advocated fitnah and hated the Companions, who

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

163

fabricated false reports and poehy, which they then falsely amibuted
to the most prominent Companions and Tibi'oon who took part in
the Battle of Siffeen. They tried to make them appear very eager for
this war, so as to instil hatred in people's hearts; they did their utmost
to perpetuate the
The call for referring to the Book of Allah for judgement
without any assurance that the killers of 'Uthmk would be banded
over to Mu'iiwiyah, and the acceptance of this arbitration without any
assurance that Mu'iwiyah would obey 'Ali and swear allegiance to
him, are developments that were dictated by the consequences of
Siffeen. The battle had led to the killing of a large number of
Muslims, and it created a common inclination towards the idea that
stopping the fighting and bloodshed had become a necessity because
it was important to preserve the Ummah's strength against its
enemies. This was indicative of the vitality and awareness of the
Ummah and its impact on d e c i s i ~ n - m a k i n ~ . ~ ~ ~
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) agreed to stop fighting at
Siffeen and he agreed to arbitration, which he regarded as a
breakthrough; then he went back to ~ u f a h . ~He~ 'hoped that the
arbitration would put an end to the dispute, unite the Ummah,
strengthen the state and revita!ise the conquest movement. A number
of factors contributed to both sides reaching the idea of arbitration
and accepting it:
(a) It was a final attempt to stop the conflict and bloodshed.
Previous attempts, both collective and individual, had
begun after the Battle of the Camel but had not succeeded.
The letters that had been exchanged between the two sides,
expressing the view of each, did not lead to any resolution
either. The last of these attempts was that made by
Mu'iwiyah during the days when fighting had intensified.
He wrote to 'Ali (&),
. . asking him to stop fighting; he said,

164

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

"I think that if you and we had known that the fighting
would reach the level that it has reached, we would not
have brought it upon ourselves. If we did not use our
reason before, then it is not too late to refer to reason so
that we may regret what has passed and put right what is
@) Many had been slain, and a great deal of blood had been

shed. There was the fear that the Ummah might be wiped
out; thus the call to stop the fighting was something that
everyone was hoping for.
(c) The people were exhausted from the fighting that had gone
on for so long; it was as if the call for a peace deal and
reconciliation came at the right time. The majority of
'Ali's army was inclined towards making peace, and they
kept saying: "War has consumed us. We think that we
cannot survive unless we make a peace deal."583 This is
contrary to the worthless view alleging that raising the
mu~hafson the spears was a hick suggested by 'Amr ibn
al-'As. In fact, the idea of raising the mushafs was not
invented by 'Amr ibn al-'AS; the mu~hafhad been raised
during the Battle of the Camel when its canier Ka'b ihn
Soor, the judge of Basrah, was struck by an arrow and
killed.
(d) This was a response to the verse that calls for peace. Allah
says: %[And]if you differ in anything amongst yourselves,
refer it to Allah and His Messenger) (Qur'an4: 59). This is
supported by what 'Ali ibn Ahi Tilib said when he was
called to refer to the Book of Allah for judgement. He said:
"Yes, I should be the first to accept that; between us and
you is the Book of ~ l l a h . " * ~ ~

hadith.586 He continued fighting until he was killed.587

hih hit

The killing of 'Ammk had an impact on Mu'iwiyah's camp.
Abn 'Abdur-R&&
asSulami entered the camp of the Syrians and
saw Mu'iwiyah, 'Amr ibn al-'.&, 'Amr's son Abdullah ihn 'Amr
and Abu al-A'war as-Snlami drinking at the water source, which was
the only water source available to both sides. They were talking
about the killing of ' A m m ~
ibn YLir, and Ahdullah ibn 'Amr said to
his father: 'We have killed this man, and the Messenger of Allah (@)
said concerning him: 'He will be killed by the group that is in the
wrong."' 'Amr said to Mu'zwiyah: "We have killed the man of
whom the Messenger of Allah (B)said what he said." Mu'iwiyah
said: "Be quiet! By Allah, yon are unstable. Did we kill him? Those
who brought him out are the ones who killed him."588
Mu'2wiyah's interpretation spread like wildfire among the
Syrians. It is narrated in a sound report that 'Amr ibn Hazm entered
upon 'Amr ibn al-'AS and said: 'Ammk has been killed, and the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said of him: 'He will be killed by the group
that is in the wrong."' 'Amr ibn al-'AS got up in a panic and went to
Mu'iwiyah, who said to him: "What is the matter with you?" He
said: 'Ammi%has been killed." Mu'iwiyah said: "So what?" 'Amr

'Yon are unstable. Did we kill him? He was killed by 'Ali and his
companions; they brought him out and threw him among our spears
(or our swords)."589
According to another sound report, two men came to
Mu'iwiyah arguing over the killing of 'Arnmir, with each of them
saying: "I killed him." Abdullah ibn 'Amr ihn al-'& said: "Let one
of you give up this claim to the other, for I heard the Messenger of
Allah (g)
say: 'He will be killed by the group that is in the wrong."'
Mu'2wiyah said: "?Vhy are you with us then?" Abdullah said: "My
father complained about me to the Messenger of Allah (g),
and he
said: 'Obey your father as long as he is alive, and do not disobey
him.' I am with you, but I am not fighting."590
From the above reports, we may note that the Companion with
deep understanding, Abdullah ibn 'Amr(&), was keen to speak the
@nth and offer sincere advice. He thought that Mu'2wiyah and his
troops were the group that was in the wrong because they killed
'Ammir, and he repeated this denunciation on different occasions.
No doubt the killing of 'Ammk (&) had an effect on the Syrians
because of this hadith, but Mu'iwiyah (&) interpreted the hadith
inappropriately. It is not right to say that those who killed 'Ammir

from this hadith that he would be with the group that was in the

the hidden meaning of the words of the Prophet (g),

(e) Al-QZdi Abu Balcr ihn al-'Arabi said concerning the verse, (And
if two parties [or groups] among the believers...# (Qur'an 49: 9):
"This verse provides basic guidelines with regard to Muslims
fighting Muslims and is the reference point with regard to
fighting those who justify their transgression on the basis of
misinterpretation. The Companions referred to it, and the
prominent people of this Ummah also turned to it. This is what
the Prophet (gg)meant when he said: ' 'Amm2r will be kZed by
the group that is in the wrong."'603
(

Ibn Taymiyah said: "This is indicative of the soundness of 'Ali's
caliphate -that it was obligatory to obey him, and that the one
who called for obeying him was calling people to paradise and
the one who called for fighting him was callimg people to hell,
even if he had some justification for that based on
misinterpretation. It also indicates that it was not permissible to
fight 'Ali (&); based on that, the one who was fighting him was
wrong, even if he thought that he had a reason, or was
transgressing without any justification. This is the more correct
of the two views of our companions; it is the d i n g that those
who fought 'Ali
were wrong. This is also the view of the
leading jurists, who based their research on that verse with
regard to fighting rebels and transgressors who have their own
justifi~ation."~~~

He also said: "Although 'Ali was closer to the m t h than his
opponents, and although 'Ammiir was killed by the group that
was in the wrong, as is mentioned in the text, we have to believe
everything that came from Allah (g)
and submit to the truth in
totality; we should not follow whims and desires or speak
without knowledge. Rather we should follow the path of
knowledge and justice, which means following the Qur'an and
Snnnah. As for those who adhere to part of the truth and not
other parts, this is the cause of division and disputes."605
(g) 'Abdul-'Azeez ihn B k said: "The Prophet (g)
said in the hadith
of ' A m m k "Ammir will be killed by the group that is in the
wrong,' and he was killed by Mu'iwiyah and his companions in
the Battle of Siffeen. Therefore Mu'swiyah and his companions
were transgressors and were in the wrong, but their stance was
based on their own reasoning, as they thought that they were
doing right in seeking vengeance for the murder of ' ~ t h m h . " ~ ' ~

01) Sa'eed Hawa said: "After 'Ammir -whom the texts confirmed
would be killed by the group that was in the wrong -was killed,
it became clear to those who had been hesitant that 'ALi (4)
was
in the right, and that fighting on his side was obligatory. Hence
Ibn 'Umar expressed his regret for keeping out of it, and he felt
sony for that because he had abandoned his duty, which was to
support the true leader against those who had rebelled against
him without properjustification, as was stated by the j~rists."~''

2.2.7. Refuting the statement of Mu'gwiyah (&)

that 'AmmC was killed by those who
had brought him to the battlefield6''
The majority of the Companions and T2biZoonunderstood
from the words of the Messenger of Allah (&) to 'Am&, "You will
be killed by the group that is in the wrong,';609 that what was meant

170

7'he Battles of the Camel and Sifeen, and the issue of arbitration

was the army of Mu'iwiyah (&), even though Mu'iwiyah and his
army may be excused for basing their decision on their own
reasoning, as their aim was to do the right thing. But what they did
was not the right thing, and 'Ali's group was closer to the truth than
they were, as the Prophet (g)
said.610Even though the scholars did
not like Mu'Zwiyah's interpretation - as we shall see below -they
tried to find an excuse for him because he based his decision on his
own reasoning.
With regard to the Prophet's words, "He will call them to
paradise, and they will call him to hell," Ibn Hajar says:61' "If it is
said that he was killed at Siffeen when he was with 'Ali (&), and
those who killed him were on Mn'iwiyah's side, and there was a
group of the Compauions with Mu'iwiyah, then how can we say that
that they were calling people to hell? The answer is that they thought
that they were calling him to paradise, and they had their own
reasoning for that, so there should be no blame on them for following
what they thought best. What is meant by calling to paradise is
calling to the means that lead to paradise, which is obeying the
caliph. What 'Ammik was doing was calling them to obey 'Ali (&),
who was the caliph who was to be obeyed at that time. They were
calling him to something other than that, but they are to he excused
because they had their own reasoning that they thought was
correct."612
Al-Qnrtubi said: "Imam Abu al-Ma'% said in al-Zrshzd: "Ali
(&) became the true Imam or leader after he was appointed to the
caliphate, m d those who fought him were transgressing, but thinking
positively of them requires us to think that their intention was good,
even though they got it wrong."'613 He also said: 'Ali (&)
responded to Mu'iwiyah's argument by saying: 'Then in that case,
the Messenger of Allah @) killed Hamzah when he took him out
with him in the army.' what 'Ali (g)
said was to draw attention to

the implications of such a statement. This was suggested by Imam alHifidh Abu al-Khat~ibibn
Ibn Katheer said: "MuZ2wiyah'ssuggestion that 'Amm2r 'was
killed by those who brought him to our swords' is a very far-fetched
misinterpretation, because if that were so, then the commander of the
army would be the killer of those who were killed fighting for the
sake of Allah
as he brought them to the swords of the

enemy.

Ihn Taymiyah said: "I do not know of anyone who held this
view among the followers of the four Imams and others among Ah1
as-Sunnah, although it is the opinion of a large number of the
Manvinis and those who agreed with them."616
Ibn al-Qayyim said, commenting on this misinterpretation:
"Yes, the misinterpretation of the people of Syria is invalid, because
the Prophet (&) said to 'Ammk 'Yon will be killed by the group
that is in the wrong.'617 They said: 'We did not kill him; rather he
was killed by those who brought him and make him stand in front of
our spears.' This is an invalid interpretation that is conhary to the
wording and apparent meaning. The one who killed him is the one
who did the action of killing him, not the one who had him on his side
fighting for

2.2.8. Who was the killer of 'AmmGr ibn YGsir?
Abu al-Ghidiyah alJuhani said, speaking of his killing of
'Ammk "On the day of Siffeen, I marched to the area between the
two armies, and I saw a man with his 'awrah619 showing. I stabbcd
him on his knees with a spear, and he fell. His helmet fell from his
head, and I struck him on his head, then I realised that it was the bead
of 'Ammk Thus 'Amm2r was killed." The narrator said: "Abu alGhidiyah asked for water, and water was brought in a glass, but he

say: 'The one who kills 'Ammk and the one who strips the booty
from h i will be in hell."'62L Ibn Katheer said: "It is known that
'Amm% was in 'Ali's army at the Battle of Siffeen, and he was killed
by the Syrian companions of Mu'iwiyah. The one who actually
killed him was called Abu al-Ghgdiyah, who was an ordinary man,
and it was said that he was a

Ibn Hajar said: "Our view of the Companions who were
involved in these wars is that they had their own reasons and
justifications for doing so. The one who bases his action on valid
reasoning but gets it wrong will have one reward, and if this is the
case for ordinary people, then it is likely to be even more applicable
to the ~ o m ~ a n i o n s . " ~ ~ ~
Adh-Dhahabi said: "According to the Rifi&s, Ibn Maljam (the
one who killed 'Ali) will be the most wretched of creation in the
hereafter. For us Sunnis, he is one of those whom we hope will be in
hell, but it is possible tbat Allah ( B )may forgive him, contrary to the
view of the Kharijites and Rifidis. He comes under the same ruling as
those who killed 'Uthmh, az-Zubayr, Talhah, Sa'eed ibn Jubayr,
' A m % , K h z j a h and al-Husayn; we disavow ourselves of them and
hate them for the sake of Allah
but we leave their cases to
Allah, may He be glorified and e x a ~ t e d . " ~ ~

(s),

Al-Albhi made an intelligent comment on what Ibn Hajar
said: "This is true, but applying it to every individual involved is
problematic, because this contradicts what is mentioned in the hadith
under the chapter heading, 'The one who kills 'Amm% and the one
who strips the booty from him will be in hell.'625It is not possible to
say tbat Abu al-Ghsdiyah, the killer of 'Ammi%,will be rewarded

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

173

because he killed him on the basis of some justification that he had in
his mind, when the Messenger of Allah (B)said that the killer of
'Ammir would be in
The correct view is to say that the
principle is sound unless there is definitive evidence to the contrary,
in which case it is an exception, as is the case here. This way of
understanding the issue is better than contradicting the sound
hadith."627
Ibn 'Abdul-Barr mentioned the biography of Abu al-Gh2diyah
al-Juhani and said: "There was a difference of opinion concerning his
name. It was said that it was Yasir ibn Sabu', or Yasir ihn Azhar, or
Muslim. He lived in Syria, in Wisit, and is regarded as Syrian. He
met the Prophet
when he was young, and it is narrated that he
said: 'I met the Prophet &) when I was a teenager, tending my
family's sheep.' He heard from the Prophet (@) the words, 'Do not
return to disbelief after I am gone, striking one another's necks.' He
loved 'Uthmh (&), and he is the one who killed 'Ammi%ibn YLir.
He would describe how he killed 'Ammir if he was asked, and he
would not mind. His story is astounding to scholars."6z8

2.2.9. Noble conduct during battle
The Battle of Siffeen was one of the most remarkable battles
among Muslims. This conflict was so amazing that the reader cannot
believe what he is reading, and he is shocked by the behaviour of
people on both sides. Each of them stood in the midst of battle, with
his sword unsheathed and firmly convinced of the cause for which he
was fighting. It was not a battle in which people were driven by
leaders who were pushing the troops into a fight of which they were
not convinced. Rather it was a battle that was unique in its motives
and in the way it was conducted, as well as the impact it left behind.
The motives in the hearts of the participants were highlighted by
some stories that have reached us in the historical sources.

174

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

They were like brothers, going together to the water source, all
drinking from it and crowding one another, scooping up the water, hut
no man harmed another.629When the fighting stopped, they behaved
like brothers living together. One of the participants said: "When we
had a break from fighting, we would go to one another's camp and
speak to one another."630They were members of one tribe, each with
his own opinion, so people of one tribe on one side might fight bitterly
with people of the same tribe on the other side,631each believing that
he was in the right and prepared to be killed for his cause. Two men
would fight until they were exhausted, then they would sit and rest
and talk to one another a great deal, then they would get up and tight
again.632They belonged to one religion, which was dearer to them
than their own souls. When the time for prayer came, they would stop
fighting so that they could pray.633When 'Ammir (&) was killed,
both sides offered the funeral prayer for him.634
An eyewitness who took part in the Battle of Siffeen said:
"Fighting broke out at Siffeen, and we kept fighting for days; many
of us were killed until even the horses were stabbed and killed. 'Ali
sent word to 'Amr ibn al-'AS telling him that the number of
slain bad increased, and he should stop fighting so that each side
could bury its dead. He agreed, and the people mixed with one
another until they were like that," and he intertwined his fingers.
"One of the companions of 'Ali would charge and be killed in the
camp of Mu'Zwiyah, then he would he brought out from it. The
companions of 'Ali (&)
, ., carried one of their dead before 'Amr, and
when he saw him, he said: 'He strove hard and adhered strongly to
the command of Allah (&). ,,r635

(4)

They would hasten to forbid evil, even in this situation, There
was a group of pious people who were among the Syrian students of
Abdullah ibn Mas'ood; they did not join either Amir al-Mn'mineen
'Ali or Mu'Zwiyah ibn Abi Sufyk. They said to Amir al-

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

1 75

Mu'mineen: "We will go out with you, hut we will not join your
camp. We will camp on our own until we see how things turn out
between you and the people of Syria. If we see someone wanting that
which is not permissible for him or transgressing, then we will he
against him. 'Ali (&) said: 'Welcome; this is a deep understanding
of Islam and knowledge of the Sunnah. Whoever does not approve of
this is a transgressor and betrayer."'636

In fact, this attitude is based on conviction and views that were
deeply rooted in their souls, and they fought on that

2.2.10. Treatment of captives
Good treatment of the captives and kindness towards them is
something to he expected at Siffeen, since we have discussed the
noble conduct of both sides when fighting. Islam has outlined how
captives are to be treated. The Messenger of Allah (gJencouraged
kind treatment of captives and giving them the best available food.
This was in the case of non-Muslims, so how about if the captives are
Muslims? Undoubtedly honouring them and treating them kindly is
emphasised even more.
However, a prisoner of war is regarded as a potential
reinforcement for his group if he is released.638 Hence 'Ali (&)
instructed that they should be detained. If any prisoner swore
allegiance to him, he was to he released; if he refused, his weapon
and mount were to he confiscated or given to the one who had
captured him, and he was asked to swear an oath that he would not
fight. According to one report, he would give him four dirhams.639
'Ali's aim in doing that is quite clear; it was to weaken the rebel side.
A prisoner was brought to him on the day of Siffeen, and he said: "Do
not kill me in captivity." 'Ali (&) said: ''I will not kill you in
captivity, for I fear Allah, the Lord of the worlds." He let him go,
then he said: "Is there any goodness in you to swear a ~ l e g i a n c e ? " ~ ~

176

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

From these reports, it seems that the treatment of captives was
as follows:
*

They were honoured and treated kindly.

-3

They were given the option of swearing allegiance and
obeying the caliph, in which case they would be released.

.'

If a prisoner refused to swear allegiance, his weapon would be
confiscated and he would be asked to swear an oath that he
would not go back to fighting; if he did so, then he would be
released.
If the prisoner insisted on fighting, then he would be kept in
captivity, but he would not be killed.641 On one occasion,
fifteen prisoners were brought to 'Ali (&), and it seems that
they were wounded. Those who died were washed and
shrouded, and the funeral prayer was offered for them."'
Mubibb ad-Deen al-Khateeh said, commenting on this battle:
"Nevertheless, this exemplary battle was the first humane war
in history, in which both sides adhered to the principles of
virtue that the wise men of the West wish were implemented in
their wars, even in the twenty-first century. Many of the
principles of war in Islam wonld not have been known and
written down were it not for this battle taking place, and Allah
(&) has wisdom in all affairs." Ibn al-'Adeem said: "I say: All
of that shows the rulings and guidelines on fighting the
transgressing group (rebels). Hence Abu Haneefah said: 'Were
it not for 'Ali's treatment of them, no one wonld know how to
deal with Muslims (who rebel against

2.2.11. The number of people slain
The scholars have conflicting views concerning the number of
people slain at Siffeen. Ibn Ahi Khaythamah said that it was seventy

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

177

thousand: twenty-five thousand of the people of Iraq and forty-five
thousand of the people of ~ y r i a Ibn
. ~ al-Qayyim
~ ~
said that it was
seventy thousand or more.645 Undoubtedly these numbers are not
accurate; they are wildly inflated.
The real fighting and al-out battle lasted for three days, during
which the fighting was stopped at night except for the Friday
evening, so the total period of fighting was approximately thirty
No matter how violent the fighting was, it could not have
been more intense than Qidisiyyah, where the number of martyrs
was 8 , 5 0 0 . ~Logically,
~~
it is difficult to accept the reports that
mention these huge figures.

2.2.12.Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali's inspection
of the dead and praying for mercy for them
After the end of each round of the battle, Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) would check on the dead. An eyewitness said: "I saw 'Ali
on the Prophet's mule ash-Shahba', going around among the
slain,x648

While he was checking on the slain, accompanied by alAshtar, he passed by the body of a man who had been one of the wellknown judges and worshippers in Syria. Al-Ashtar (or according to
another report, 'Adiyy ibn Hitim) said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, is
ibis^^^ with them? I thought he was a good believer and had strong
faith." 'Ali (&) said: "He is still a good believer today." Perhaps
this man who had been killed was the judge who came to 'Umar ibn
al-Khat&b and said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, I had a dream that
alanned me." He sajd: "What was it?" He said: "I saw the sun and
moon fighting, and the stars were divided between them, half and
half." He said: "Which of them were you with?" He said: "With the
moon against the sun." 'Umar said: "Allah says: (And We have
appointed the night and the day as two Ayrit [signs etc.]. Then, We

178

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

have obliterated the sign of the night [with darkness] while We have
made the sign of the day illuminating) (Qur'an 17: 12). Depart, for by
Allah you will never do any work for me." The narrator said: "I heard
that he was killed fighting for Mu'iwiyah at ~ i f f e e n . " ~ ~ '
'Ali (4)
stood over the slain of his party and the slain of
Mu'iwiyah's party and said: "May Allah forgive you, may AUah
forgive you," for both parties.651It was narrated that Yazeed ibn alA ~ a m msaid: "When the peace deal was agreed between 'Ali and
Mu'iwiyah, 'Ali went out andwalked among the slain of his party
and said: 'They are in paradise.' Then he went to the slain of
Mu'iwiyah's party and said: 'They are in paradise, then judgement
will be passed between me and ~ u ' i w i ~ a h . "He
' ~used
~ ~ to say of
them that they were believers.653 What 'Ali (&) said about the
people who were killed at Siffeen was not much different from what
he said about the people who were killed at the Battle of the

camel.654

2.2.13. Attitude of Mu'swiyah towards
the Byzantine ruler
The rnler of Byzantium tried to take advantage of the
difference of opinion that occurred between Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
and Mu'Swiyah (may Allah be pleased with them both) by acquiring
some of the lands that were under Mu'iiwiyah's control. Ibn Katheer
said: "The rnler of Byzantium got his hopes up of attacking
Mu'gwiyah, after Mu'iwiyah had scared and humiliated him and had
defeated him and his troops. When the rnler of Byzantium saw that
Mu'iwiyah was preoccupied with fighting 'Ali (&), he marched to
some Muslim territory with a large number of troops, hoping to gain
control of it. Mu'iwiyah wrote to him, saying: 'By Allah, if you do
not give up and go back to your own country, 0 cursed one, I shall
reconcile with my cousin against you, and I shall drive you from all

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

179

of your land and leave you no room on earth, vast as it is.' At that
point, the rnler of Byzantium got scared and refrained from fighting,
and he sent a message asking for a truce."655 This is indicative of
MuC2wiyah'sintegrity and his love of Islam.

2.2.14. A false story about
'Amr ibn al-'As at Siffeen
N a g ibn Muzd-Kufi said: "The people of Iraq charged
and engaged in fighting with the Syrians, and they fought hard. 'Amr
ibn al-'As charged but was intercepted by 'Ali." The story goes on to
say: "Then 'Ali stabbed 'Amrand threw him down, and 'Amr tried to
protect himself with his legs, and his 'awrah (the part of a person's
body that must he screened from public view) became uncovered.
'Ali tnmed his face away from him and looked away. The people
said: 'The man has gotten away, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen.' He said:
'Do you know who he is? They said: 'No.' He said: 'He is 'Amribn
al-'AS. He showed me his 'awrah, so I tnmed my face away. ,,,656
This story was also mentioned by Ihn d-Kalbi, as stated by asSuhayli in ar-Rawd al-Anif 'Ali (&) supposedly said: "He
protected himself by showing his 'awrah and reminded me of the ties
of kinship." Something similar is narrated from 'Amr ibn al-'As
(4)
with regard to the day of ~ i f f e e n . ~ ~ '
The response to this fabrication and blatant lie is as follows:
the narrator of the first report, N a g ibn M u z G m al-Kufi, ihe author
of the book Waq'at Siffeen, was an extreme Shia, so it comes as no
surprise that he would tell lies and fabricate stories about the
Companions. Adh-Dhahahi said concerning him in al-Mizrin: "Nasr
ibn Muz&im al-Kufi is an extreme Rsidi, and they rejected him."
AlL'Aqeeli said concerning him: "He is a Shia, and his hadiths
contain a lot of flaws and mistakes." Ahu Khaythamah said: "He was
a liar."658 Ibn Hajar said concerning him: "Al-'Ajli said: 'He was an

180

The Battles of the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

extreme R%@ and is not trustworthy at all."'659 Hishim ibn
Muhammad ibn d-S2ib d-Kalbi said: "They were agreed that he
was an extreme Shia." Imam Ahmad said: "Who nanates from him?
I do not think that anyone narrates from him." Ad-Diraqutni said:
"He is rejected."660 Via these two RZfidis, this story became widely
known, and the Shia historians who came after them welcomed it
warmly, as did some of the Sunnis who were deceived by the lies of
the ~ i f i @ s . ~ ~ '
This story may be regarded as an exanlple of the lies and
fabrications of the Rzfidi Shia against the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah (g).
The enemies of the Companions among the
RZ& historians fabricated bad qualities that they ascribed to the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g),
and they wrote them in
the form of stories and poetry that could be spread easily among the
Muslims, aiming to undermine the status of the righteous
Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Sunni Muslims were
not paying attention; they started at a late stage to examine and verify
the reports of Islamic history, after those poems and stories had
spread everywhere and become widely known among the
storytellers. By then, many of them had unfortunately come to be
accepted, even among Sunni historians.66z

2.2.15. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (A)visits a
graveyard on his way back from ~iffeen
After Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) had fiuished at Siffeen, he
passed by a graveyard and said: "Peace be upon you, people of the
desolate and isolated abode, believing men and women, Muslim men
and women. You have gone before us, and we are following in your
footsteps and will join you soon. 0 Allah, forgive us and them, and
bestow Your mercy on us and them. Praise be to Allah Who has
made the earth a receptacle for the living and the dead. Praise be to

'Aliibn Abi Tilib

181

AUah Who has created you, and on it He will gather you, and from it
He will raise you. Glad tidings to the one who remembers the
Resurrection, prepares himself for the Reckoning and is content with
the little that he has been given."663

2.2.16. Insistence of 'UthmSn's murderers
that the battle should continue

(4)

The murderers of 'Uthmk
were very keen that the battle
between the two sides should continue until the people were wiped
out and the strength of both sides was lessened, so that they would be
safe from retaliation and punishment. They panicked when they saw
the people of Syria raising up the mu~hafsand 'Ali (&) responding
to their request by ordering that the fighting and bloodshed be
stopped. They tried to make 'Ali change his mind, but the battle
stopped; as a result, they felt helpless and had no alternative but to
rebel against 'Ali (&). So they fabricated the idea that the ruling
belongs to Allah (and not to people), and they kept away from both
sides.
What is strange is that the historians did not pay as much
attention to what these people did at this stage as they did with regard
to the Battle of the Camel, even though they were present in 'Ali's
army, or to the reason why these negotiations that went on for many
months failed, or the role that the murderers of 'Uthm2n (&) may
have played in the Battle of Siffeen to cause the failure of all attempts
at reconciliation between the two sides - because reconciliation
between 'Ali and Mu'2wiyah would have been like reaching a deal to
bring them to justice and execute them. It does not make sense to
suggest that they strove hard during the Battle of the Camel to make
the fighting continue, but did not do the same thing at ~ i f f e e n . ~ "

2.2.17. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
forbids impugning Mu'swiyah and
cursing the people of Syria
It was narrated that when 'Ali (&) heard that two of his
companions were openly reviling Mu'iiwiyah and cursing the people
of Syria, he sent word to them telling them to stop what they were
doing. They came to him and said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, are we
not in the right and they in the wrong?' He said: "Yes indeed, by the
Lord of the Ka'bah." They said: "Then why are you stopping us from
reviling and cursing them?" He said: "I do not want you to be people
who curse; rather you should say: '0 AUah, protect our blood and
theirs, reconcile between us and them. Save them from their
misguidance, so that truth will become clear to those who are
unaware of it and those who got canied away in misguidance will
give up their stubborn ways. ,,,665
With regard to what is said about 'Ali cursing Mu'iiwiyah and
his companions in his supplications during the prayer, and
Mu'iiwiyah cursing 'Ali, Ibn 'Abhk, al-Hasan and d-Husayn when
he said supplications during the prayer, this is not true, because the

the soundest books of the Shia, there is a prohibition on reviling the
Companions, and 'Ali (&) denounced those who reviled
Mu'iiwiyah and the people with him, saying: "I do not want you to be
people who revile others; if you describe their actions and attitudes,
that is better to say and is more helpful in leaving no excuse for them.
Instead of reviling them, you can say: '0 Allah, protect our blood and
theirs from being shed and reconcile between us and them."'670 This
reviling and denouncing them as disbelievers was not part of 'Ali's
practice, according to the soundest Shia book^."^'

3. Arbitration
Both sides agreed to refer to arbitration after the end of the
battle of Siffeen. Each side was to appoint a man as an arbitrator to
represent it, then the two arbitrators were to reach an agreement that
was in the best interests of the Muslims. Mu'2wiyah appointed 'Amr
ibn al-'As, and 'Ali appointed Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari (may Allah be
pleased with them all), and a document was written concerning that.
The place where the two arbitrators were to meet was Doomat alJandal, in the month of Ramadan 37 AH. Some of 'Ali's army
thought that this action was a sin that implied disbelief and that he
should repent to Allah, they rebelled against him and became h o w n
as the Kharijites (rebels). 'Ali (&) sent lbn 'Abbgs (&) to debate
with them, and then 'Ali (4)
himself debated with them. A group of
them rejoined him, but others refused, and there were battles between
them and 'Ali (&), which weakened and exhausted his forces. They
kept causing trouble until they assassinated him; we will discuss this
in detail below.
The issue of arbitration is regarded as one of the most serious
issues in the history of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. Many writers lost
their way when discussing it and wrote about it in a confused manner

184

The Battles of the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

in their books. They relied on weak and fabricated reports that
distorted the image of the noble Companions, especially Abu Moosa
al-Ash'ari. He was described as a feebleminded and weak character
who was easily deceived with words, and as a man who was so
heedless that he was tricked by 'Amr ibn al-'AS with regard to the
matter of arbitration. They described ' A m ibn EL-'& (&) as a crafty
and deceitful man. These writers, who had ulterior motives ;md a
grudge against Islam, tried to ascribe to these two great men many
blameworthy characteristics, even though these were the two men
whom the Muslims chose to make a decision regarding a serious
dispute that had led to the killing of many Muslims. Many historians,
writers and researchers treated these reports, which were fabricated
by the opponents of the Companions, as if they were historical facts.
People accepted them without examining them, as if they were sound
and as if there was no doubt concerning them. It may be because of
the exciting, narrative style in which they were written, or because
the claims of trickery and deceit made people interested in it and
made the historians keen to write it down. We are speaking about the
details of what happened, not the issue of arbitration itself, because
there is no doubt that it took place.672

I decided to begin this discussion with a look at the biography
of the two great Companions, Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari and 'Amr ibn
al-'As (may Allah be pleased with them both).

3.1. Biography of Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari
His full name was Abdullah ibn Qays ibn Haddir ibn Harb. He
was the great leader and Companion of the Messenger of Allah (g),
Abu Moosa d-Ash'ari at-Tameemi, the prominent scholar and reciter
of ~ n r ' a n . ~Abu
' ~ Moosa became Muslim during the early days in
MaWtah. Ibn Sa'd said: "He came to Makkah and formed an alliance
with Sa'eed ibn al-'As. He became Muslim early on and migrated to

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

185

~ b ~ s s i n i aSome
. " ~ ~reports
~
say that he went back to his people to
call them to Allah. Ibn Hajar reconciled the reports about his
becoming Muslim, saying: "There is some confusion about the
reports that said that Abu Moosa migrated to Abyssinia, because
what is mentioned in the sound report is that Abu Moosa left his land
with a group of people, heading towards the Prophet (@J in Khaybar.
It is possible to reconcile these reports by noting that Abu Moosa
migrated first to Makkah, where he became Muslim, and the Prophet
@) sent him with those whom he sent to Abyssinia. Abn Moosa
went to his people's land, which was opposite Abyssinia on the
eastern side. When he realised that the Prophet (gJand his
Companions had settled in Madinah, he headed for Madinah, along
with those of his people who had become Muslim, but the ship that
was carrying them ended up in Abyssinia because the wind blew it
off course. That is possible and thus the reports may be reconciled
and should be adopted."675

3.1.1. The badge of honour that the Messenger
of Allah (g)
pinned to the chest of Abu Moosa
3.1.1.a. "You migrated twice: your migration
t o Abyssinia and your migration to me"
It was narrated that Abu Moosa said: "We set out from Yemen
with more than fifty of my people. We were three brothers: myself,
Abn Ruhm and Abu 'Amir. But our ship took us to Abyssinia, where
Ja'far and his companions were, and we came when Khaybar was
conquered. The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'Yon migrated twice:
your migration to Abyssinia and your migration to me. ,,,676
It was also narrated that Anas said: "The Messenger of Allah
said: 'Tomorrow people will come to you whose hearts are more
receptive to Islam than yours.' The Ash'aris came, and when they
drew close they began to recite poetry: 'Tomorrow we will meet all

our loved ones, Muhammad and his party.' When they anived, they
shook hands; they were the first ones to start the tradition of shaking
hands."677
3.1.1.b. "They are your people, 0 Abu Moosa"
It was narrated that 'Iy2d d-Ash'ari said: "When the verse,
dAllah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love
Himb (Qur'an 5: 54) was revealed, the Messenger of Allah (g)
said:
'They are your people, 0 Abu Moosa,' and he pointed to him."678
3.1.l.c. "0 AIlah, forgive Abdullah ibn Qays
for his sins, and admit him to a gate of
great honour o n the Day of Resurrection"

(s)

It was narrated that Ahu Moosa said: "When the Prophet
had finished with Hnnayn, he sent Abu 'Amir al-Ash'ari at the head
of an anny to Aw@, where he met Durayd ibn as-Sammah. Durayd
was killed, and AUah caused his companions to be defeated. Ahn
'An51 was struck iu the knee with an arrow, and it was stuck in his
knee. I came to him and said: '0 uncle, who strnck you?' Abu 'Amir
pointed him out, and I went and caught up with him, hut he ran away
when he saw me. I started saying: 'Don't you feel ashamed? Aren't
you an Arab? Won't you stand firm?' So he stopped, and we met and
traded blows; then I killed him. I went back to Abu '&nit and said:
'Allah has killed your opponent.' He said: 'Pull this arrow out.' I
pulled it out, and water came out of the wound. He said: '0 son of my
brother, go to the Messenger of Allah (g)
and convey greetings of
saliim to him from me, and say to him: " A ~ U'Amir says to you: 'Pray
for forgiveness for me."" Abu ' h r appointed me in charge of the
people, and it was not long before he died. When we returned, I told
the Prophet (g)
what had happened. He made wudoo', then he raised
his hands until I could see the whiteness of his armpits, and he said:
'0 Allah, forgive Abu 'Amif. Then he said: '0 Allah, on the Day of

Resurrection make him above many of Your creation.' I said: 'And
me, 0 Messenger of Allah?' He said: '0 Allah, forgive Abdullah ibn
Qays for his sins, and admit him to a gate of great honour679on the
Day of ~ e s u r r e c t i o n . " ' ~ ~ ~

3.1.1.d. "This one has rejected glad tidings;
you t w o should accept it"
It was narrated that Abn Moosa said: "I was with the
~ ~ ~ a Bedouin came and
Messenger of Allah (&) in a l - ~ i ' r i n a hwhen
said: 'Will you fulfil your promise to me, 0 Muhammad?' The
Messenger of AUab (&) said to him: 'Be of good cbeer.' The
Bedouin said to him: 'How often you say to me, "Be of good cbeer."'
The Messenger of Allah
turned to Bil2 and me, saying: 'This
one has rejected glad tidings; yon two should accept it.' They said:
'We accept it, 0 Messenger of Allah.' The Messenger of AUah (.@J
called for a vessel of water. He washed his hands and face in it and
rinsed his mouth, then he said: 'Drink from it and pour some on your
heads and chests.' We did that, and Umm Salamah called out to us
from behind the curtain: 'Leave some of that which is in your vessel
for your mother.' So we left some of it for her."682

3.1.1.e. "He has been given a beautiful voice
like that of DSwood"
It was narrated from Abdullah ibn Buraydah that his father
said: "I came out of the mosque one night and saw the Prophet (g)
standing at the door of the mosque, and a man was praying. He said
to me: '0 Buraydah, do you think he is showing off?' I said: 'Allah
and His Messenger know best.' He said: 'Rather he is a devoted
believer. He has been given a beautiful voice like that of Dzwood.' I
went to him and saw that he was Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, and I told
him.n683

3.1.1.f. "0 Abdullah ibn Qays, shall I not tell you
of one of the treasures of paradise?"
It was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari said: "We were
with the Prophet (g)
on a journey, and the people were climbing a
hill. Every time a man reached the top of a hill, he would say: 'LZ
ilriha ill6 All6h wa AllZhu Akbar (There is none worthy of worship
other than Allah and Allah is the Greatest)' -and I think he said it at
the top of his voice. The Messenger of Allah (@Jwas on his mule,
climbing up the mountain. He said: '0 people, you are not calling
upon One Who is deaf or absent.' Then he said: '0 AbduUah ibn
Qays - or 0 Abu Moosa - shall I not tell yon of one of the
treasures of paradise?' I said: 'Yes, 0 Messenger of AUah.' He said:

The Messenger of AUah (g)
of Zubayd and den.^'^ It was narrated from Abu Moosa that when
the Prophet (g)
-- sent him to Yemen with Mu'sdh, he advised them:
"Be easygoing, and do not be harsh. Give glad tidings, and do not put
people off." Abu Moosa said to him: "In our land, there is a drink
called at-tabagh that is made from honey, and there is another drink
called al-mizr that is made from barley." The Prophet (B)said:
"Every intoxicant is h a r h . " Then both of them went on their way,
and later Mu'%& asked Abu Moosa: "How do you recite the
Qur'an?" Abu Moosa replied: "I recite it in my prayer and when
riding my mount, standing and sitting, a little at a time." Mu'Zdh
said: "I sleep then I get up, so I hope for reward from Allah when I
sleep as I seek reward from Him for my night prayer."686

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

3.1.2. The status of Abu Moosa (&)
in the view of 'Umar ibn al-~hattib(4)
Abu Moosa was one of the pillars of the Muslim state at the
time of 'Umar (&). He was a commander of the army during the
conquest of Q
U and~ Qithin
~
and
~ at the
~ Battle of as tar.^" He
was also one of the founders of the Basri school at the time of 'Umar
(&); he went to Basra and taught there.689He was regarded as one
of the most knowledgeable of the Companions. He was influenced by
'Umar ibn al-Khagb (&), and there was correspondence between
them; this is mentioned in the discussion of the institutions of
governors and judges.
Abu Moosa (&) was famous for his knowledge, worship,
piety, modesty, dignity, lack of interest in worldly gains and
steadfastness in adhering to Islam. He is regarded as one of the senior
scholars, jurists and muftis among the Companions. He was
mentioned by adh-Dhahabi in Tadhkirat al-Huffae as being at the
highest level of the Companions. He was knowledgeable and acted
upon his knowledge. He was a righteous man who constantly recited
the Book of Allah, and he had the most beautiful voice when reciting
Qur'an. He was the most knowledgeable of the people of Basra in
Qur'an and in deep understanding of Islam, and he conveyed that
excellent and blessed knowledge.
He spent a great deal of time with the Prophet (B),and he
learned from senior Companions such as 'Umar, 'Ali, Ubayy ibn
Ka'b and Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (may Allah be pleased with them
all). Abu Moosa was influenced in particular by 'Urnar ibn alKhagb, who gave him a great deal of advice and sent letters to him
during his lengthy governorship of Basra. Abu Moosa used to refer to
'Umar (4)
concerning all cases that came to him, to the extent that
ash-Shn'bi regarded him as one of the leading and most famous
judges of the Ummah. He said: "The judges of the Ummah are

~

The Battles of the Camel and Sireen, and the issue of arbitration

'Umar, 'Ali, Zayd ihn Thiihit and Ahu ~ o o s a . When
" ~ ~ Abu
~ Moosa
came to Madinah, he was keen to attend 'Umar's gatherings and
sometimes spent a long time with him. It was narrated from Ahu Bakr
ihn 'Umar that Ahu Moosa (&) came to 'Umar ihn al-Khau2h after
the evening prayer, and 'Umar
said to him: "What brings you
here?" He said: "I have come to talk to you." He said: "At this
hour?'He said: "It is to discuss a matter of knowledge." So 'Umar
(&) sat down, and they talked for a long time, then Ahu Moosa said:
"The prayer, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen." 'Umar (&) said: "We are in a
state of prayer."691

(a)

Just as Ahu Moosa was keen to seek knowledge, he was also
enthusiastic about spreading that knowledge and teaching people. In
his sermons, he would teach the .
people
. and encourage them to learn.
It was narrated that Abu al-Muhallah said: "I heard Abu Moosa on
his minhar saying: 'Whoever is granted knowledge by Allah, let him
teach it, hut he should not speak of that of which he has no
knowledge, lest he become one of those who make things up and thus
go beyond the pale of slam."'^^^
Ahu Moosa made the mosque of Basra a centre for his
academic activity, and he allocated a large portion of his time to
academic gatherings. He did not stop there, though; he did not let any
oppomity pass without making the most of it to teach and educate
the people. After he said the s a l h at the end of the prayer, he would
turn to face the people, teaching them and checking on their recitation
of the noble Qur'an. Ibn Shawdhah said: "When Ahu Moosa had
prayed the dawn prayer, he would turn to face the rows of people and
ask them to recite, one by one."693 Ahu Moosa was well known
among the Companions for his beautiful voice and recitation. The
people would gather around him when they heard him reading. When
Ahn Moosa sat with him, 'Umar (
would ask him to recite for
him whatever he could of Qur'an.

*-

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

191

Allah (&) enabled him to teach the Muslims, and he did all he
could to teach Qur'an and spread it among the people in every land
he stayed in. The people would gather around h i to hear his
beautiful voice and recitation. Seekers of knowledge crowded around
him in the mosque of Basra, and he divided them into groups
arranged in circles. He would go around reciting to them, listening to
them and correcting their recitation.695The noble Qur'an was his
main preoccupation; he devoted most of his time to it, whether or not
he was not travelling. It was narrated that Anas ibn M& said: "Al' .
me to 'Iha&$&mcilUmar~aid;
'IIowwasa1Ash'ari when you left him?' I said: 'I left him teaching people the
Qnr'an.' He said: 'He is wise and smart,696but do not tell him (that I
said that)."'697
Even when he went out for jihad, he would teach and educate
others. It was narrated that HaGb ibn Abdullah ar-Riqishi said: "We
were with Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari (&)in an army on the banks of the
Tigris when the time of prayer came, so his caller gave the call for the
noon prayer. The people went to perform wudoo', and he made
wudoo'. He led them in prayer, and then they sat in a circle. When the
time came for the afternoon prayer, his caller gave the call for that
prayer, and the people got up to do wudoo' again. His caller said: 'No
wudoo' is required except for the one who broke his wudoo'."'
His academic efforts bore fruit, and he had the joy of seeing
large numbers of people around him who had memorised the noble
Qur'an and had become scholars. In Basra alone, their number was
more than three hundred. When 'Umar ibn al-KhatGb (&) asked his
employees to send him the names of those who had memorised the
Qur'an, so that he could honour them and increase their stipends,
Abu Moosa wrote to him, telling him that the number of people with
him who had learned the Qnr'an by heart was three hundred

192

The Battles o f the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

Abu Moosa (&) also paid attention to teaching and narrating
the Sunnah. A number of Companions and senior Tihi'oon narrated
from him. Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
"Buraydah ibn d-Husayb, Abu U m h a h d-Bihili, Abu Sa'eed alKhudri, Anas ihn Msik, T&iq ihn Sbihzb, Sa'eed ibn al-Musayyab,
al-Aswad ihn Yazeed, Abu W2il Shaqeeq ibn Salamah, Abu
'Utbm2n an-Nahdi and others narrated from him."699 He
adhered strongly to the Sunnah of the Prophet (g);
this is indicated
by his conduct during his life and by what he instructed his children
to do after he died. Despite his great enthusiasm for the Sunnah, he
did not narrate a large number of hadiths, and this was true of the
senior Companions; they were very cautious in narrating from the
Prophet

(4)

a).

One of the people who was close to Ahu Moosa in Basra was
Anas ihn Mitik, who is regarded as one of his inner circle. It was
narrated from Thzbit that Anas said: "We were with Abu Moosa on a
journey, and the people were talldng and mentioning worldly
matters. Abu Moosa said: '0 Anas, these people are talking too
much. Come, let us remember our Lord for a while.' Then he said:
'What slowed the people down (in pursuing matters of the
hereafler)?' I said: 'Worldly matters, Satan and whims and desires.'
He said: 'No, it is the fact that this world is close, and they can see it,
while the hereafter is hidden from them. By Allah, if they could see it
with their own eyes, they would not drift or turn away from it."'700
Since Abu Moosa trusted Anas, he appointed him to be his
envoy to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Umar (&). Anas said: "Abu Moosa
al-Ash'ari sent me from Basra to 'Umar, who asked me about the
people's situation." After the battle of Tastar, Abu Moosa sent him to
'Umar with the prisoners and booty, and he took its Persian
commander Hormozan to mar.^^'

3.1.3. Governorship of Abu Moosa
at the time of 'Umar and ' U t h m h
(may Allah be pleased with them)
Abu Moosa is rightfully regarded as the most famous of the
governors of Basra during the time of 'Umar ibn al-Khatt2b (&).
During the time of Abu Moosa, many places in Persia were
conquered; he used to go out for jihad himself, and he would send the
commanders in different directions from Basra. The period of his
governorship was filled with jihad, and the people of Basra managed
to conquer a number of important places, including al-Ahw2z and its
environs. Abu Moosa cooperated with neighbouring governors in
many wars and conquests. He put a great deal of effort into
organising the conquered regions, appointing governors over them,
securing them and organising their affairs.
There was a great deal of correspondence between Abu Moosa
and 'Umar ibu al-Khag2b (&) concerning different issues, and
'Umar gave him valuable advice about how he should deal with the
people when he received them in his councils, and about fearing
Allah (g)
and trying to help the people. 'Urnar (&) said: "The most
blessed of people is the one whose subjects are blessed because of
him, and the most wretched of people is the one whose subjects are
wretched because of him. Beware of indulging in the people's
wealth, lest the people working for you also indulge; then your
example would he like that of the animal that looks at the green land
and starts grazing in order to grow fat, but its death will be caused by
its fatness."702There are a number of letters between 'Umar and Abn
Moosa relating to various administrative and executive issues that
Abu Moosa was taking care of with the help of instmctions from
'Umar. Most of this correspondence has been compiled by
Muhammad Hameedullah in his valuable book on political
documents.703

194

Tke Battles o f the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

The period of Abu Moosa's governorship in Basra is regarded
as one of its best periods, to the extent that one of the descendants of
the people of Basra, namely al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have
mercy on him) said: "No rider ever came and brought more blessing
to its people than Abu ~ o o s a . That
" ~ ~was
~ because Abu Moosa
(&), in addition to being a governor, was the best teacher of its
people, as he taught them the Qur'an and various matters of
religion.705
A number of cities in Persia were conquered during the
caliphate of 'Umar ibn al-Khat&b (&). They were put under the
administration of Basra and run by its governor, who appointed
workers to be in charge of them; these employees were under his
authority and reported to him directly. Thus Abu Moosa is regarded
as one of the greatest governors of 'Umar (&), and the
correspondence between 'Umar and Abu Moosa is regarded as one of
the most important sources for shedding light on Umar's conduct
with his governors and explaining the way he dealt with them?06
'Umar (&), in his instructions to the caliphs who would come after
him, recommended that no governor whom he had appointed should
be left in his post for more than a year except for Abu Moosa alAsb'ari, whom he said should be left in his post for four years.707
Abu Moosa (4)
was also appointed as the judge during the
time of 'Umar (&), and 'Umar wrote him a letter about judiciary
matters. The guidance in this letter may benefit any judge, or indeed
any administrator, in any time or place?08 Ibn al-Qayyim said
concerning it: "This is an important letter, which the scholars
welcomed and used as a basis for rulings on passing judgement and
giving testimony. Muftis are in urgent need of studying it and
learning what is in it."709
Abu Moosa was also appointed as a governor at the time of
'Uthmk (&), who asked him to be the judge in Basra. When

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

195

'Uthmin (&) was killed, Abu Moosa was the governor of Kufah,
and when 'Ali (&) was appointed as caliph, Abu Moosa accepted
the oath of allegiance for him from the people of Kufah, because he
had been its governor for 'Uthmin ibn 'Af& (&).
When 'Ali (&) was in Dhu Q2r and urged the people of
Kufah to lend him their support, Abu Moosa saw the beginning of
fitnah and division among the Muslims. He advised the people of
Kufah to stay in their houses and keep away from this issue, because
it was fitnah in which one who was sitting would be better than one
who was standing, and one who was standing would be better than
one who was walking. Because of his difference of opinion with the
caliph, he was dismissed from his position as governor of ~ u f a h . ~ "
From the time he became a Muslim, Abu Moosa (&) spent
his life spreading Islam and teaching knowledge to the people,
especially the Qur'an, as he was famous for his recitation; *ing part
in jihad for the sake of Allah (L&) and encouraging others to do so;
judging disputes between people; spreading justice; and running the
affairs of the province by means of the judiciary and administration.
There is no doubt that these tasks are difficult and require unique
skills and characteristics of knowledge, understanding, quick wit,
cleverness, piety and asceticism. Abu Moosa had an abundant share
of these characteristics. The Messenger of Allah (g),
and then the
four Rightly Guided Caliphs after him, relied on Abu ~ o o s a . ~Can
"
it be imagined that the Messenger of AUah
then the caliphs who
succeeded him, relied on a man who could be tricked in such a way as
is narrated in the story of a r b i t r a t i ~ n ? ~ ' ~

(s),

The fact that Abu Moosa (&) was chosen by 'Ali (A&,) and
his companions to be an arbitrator on behalf of the people of Iraq is in
complete harmony with the sequence of events, because the next
stage was to be the stage of reconciliation and uniting the Muslims.
Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari was one of those who had called for

196

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

reconciliation and peace; at the same time, he was loved and busted
by the tribes of Iraq. The earlier sources state that 'Ali is the one who
chose Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari. Khaleefah says in his Tbreekh: "In that
year (37 AH) the two arbitrators met: Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari on
behalf of 'Ali and ' A m ibn al-'A$ on behalf of ~ u ' i w i ~ a h . "Ibn
~'~
Sa'd said: "The people got fed up with war and were calling for
peace. They appointed 6x0 arbitrators. 'Ali appointed Abu Moosa alAsh'ari, and Mu'iiwiyah appointed 'Amr ibn al-'AS.,,714
Hence we can say that the reports about the role attributed to
the pious, devoted worshippers at Siffeen -of being responsible for
stopping the fighting and resorting to arbitration, and imposing Abu
Moosa as an arbitrator - are no more than historical lies that were
fabricated by the Shia storytellers,who never stopped fabricating and
distorting the history of Islam by means of false reports. It annoyed
them that 'Ah
seemed to be someone who showed compassion
to Mu'iiwiyah and the people of Syria and wanted to reconcile with
their traditional enemies. On the other hand, these Shia considered
their enemies the Kharijites to be responsible, but they made the
Kharijites' actions contradict themselves; the Kharijites are the ones
who allegedly forced 'Ali (&) to accept the arbitration, and they are
also the ones who rebelled against him because of his accepting the
arbitration.715

(4)

This brief look at the character of Abu Moosa is strongly
connected to our topic, the life and times of Amir al-Mn'mineen 'Ali
(+). Abu Moosa was one of the people who had a profound impact
on his era, but his character has been subjected to distortion. In most
cases, whenever anyone discussed Siffeen and the arbitration, the
characters of Abn Moosa and 'Amr ihn al-'As were subjected to
distortion, lies and fabrications because of weak and fabricated
reports. Hence it is necessruy to talk about the biographies of these
two great men, and this is one of the aims of writing this hook.

3.2. The biography of 'Amr ibn al-'AS (&)
His full name was 'Amr ibn al-'As ibn W2il as-Sahmi; his
kunyahs are Abu Muhammad and Abu Abdullah. Ibn 1 s h 2 ~ and
~'~
az-Zubayr ibn ~ a k k 2 r ~agreed
"
that he became Muslim while he was
with the Negus in Abyssinia, and he migrated to Madinah in Safar 8
AH. Ibn Hajar stated that be became Muslim in 8 AH before the
conquest of Makkah, and it was said that it was between Hudaybiyah
and ~ h a ~ b a r . ~ "

3.2.1. His becoming ~ u s l i m
'Amr ibn al-'AS (&) himself told the story of his coming to
Islam. He said: "When we came away from the Battle of the Trench, I
gathered together some men who shared my opinion and would Listen
to me, and I said: 'You know, by Allah, that in my opinion, this affair
of Muhammad will go to extraordinary lengths. I am thinking of
something, and I would like to know what you think of it.' They said:
'What are you thinking of?' I said: 'I think that we should go to the
Negus and stay with him. If Muhammad conquers our people, we
will be with the Negus, and we would prefer to be subject to his
authority rather than to Muhammad. On the other hand, if our people
prevail, they know us and will treat us well.' They thought that my
suggestion was excellent, so I told them to collect something that we
could take as a gift to the Negus. Leather was the product of our land
that he most valued, so we collected a large quantity and took it to
him.

"By Allah, while we were with him, 'Amr ibn Umayyah adDamri came to him; he had been sent by the Messenger of Allah (@
to find out about Ja'far and his companions. He had an audience with
the Negus. When he came out, I said to my companions that if I were
to go to the Negus and ask him to let me have him, he would give him
to me. Then we could cut off his head, and if I did that, Quraysh

198

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

would see that I had served them well by killing Muhammad's
messenger. So I went in to the Negus and prostrated before him as I
usually did. He welcomed me as a friend and asked if I had brought
anything from our country. When I told him that I had brought a large
quantity of leather, and I produced it, he was greatly pleased and
wanted it. I said: '0 King, I have just seen a man leave your presence.
He is the messenger of an enemy of ours, so let me have him that I
may kill him, for he has killed some of our chiefs and best men.' He
was enraged, and reaching out his hand he gave his nose such a blow
that I thought he must have broken it. If the ground had opened up, I
would have gone into it to escape his anger. Then I said to him: '0
King, by Allah, if I had thought that this would be distasteful to you, I
would not have asked it.' He said: 'Are you asking me to give you the
messenger of a man to whom the great Namoos [Jihreel (,=)I comes
as he used to come to Moosa so that you can kill him? I said: '0
King, is he really like that? He said: 'Woe to you, 0 'Amr! Obey me
and follow him, for by Allah, he is right. He will triumph over his
adversaries as Moosa triumphed over Pharaoh and his armies.' I said:
'Will you accept my oath of allegiance to him in Islam? He said:
'Yes,' and stretched out his hand, and I swore my allegiance to himin
Islam. Then I went out to my companions; my opinion had changed
from what it was before, hut I concealed my Islam from them.
-

"Then I went out, heading towards the Messenger of Allah
so that I might become Muslim, and I met Khiilid ihn al-Waleed.
That was just before the conquest of Makkah, and he was coming
from Makkah. I said: 'Where are you going, 0 Abn Sulaymk?' He
said: 'By Allah, the way has become clear. The man is indeed a
Prophet, and I am going to become Muslim, by Allah. How much
longer should I delay? I said: 'By Allah, I have only come to become
Muslim.' So we went to Madinah, to the Messenger of Allah (g).
Khiilid ibn al-Waleed went ahead of me and became Muslim and

(e)

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

gave his oath of allegiance, then I came close and said: '0 Messenger
of Allah, I will give you my oath of allegiance on the basis that my
previous sins will be forgiven and no mention will be made of what
went before.' The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: '0 'Amr, give your
oath of allegiance, for Islam erases all that came before it, and hijrah
erases all that came before it.' So I gave my oath of allegiance and
departed."719
According to another report, he said: "...when Allah put Islam
in my heart, I came to the Prophet (&)and said: 'Hold out your right
hand so that Imight swear allegiance to you.' He held out his right
hand, but I withdrew my hand. He said: 'What is the matter, 0
'Am? I said: 'I want to stipulate a condition.' He said, 'What do you
want to stipulate? Isaid: 'That Iwill be forgiven.' He said: 'Do you
not know, 0 'Am, that Islam destroys whatever came before it, and
that hijrah destroys whatever came before it, and that hajj destroys
whatever came before it?"7Z0

3.2.2. 'Amr ibn al-'A$ leads a campaign
to Dh2t as-Salbil 7 AH
The Prophet (g)
prepared an army, led by 'Amr ibn al-'As, to
go to Dhiit as-Saliisil in order to punish Qudii'ah, who had gathered
with the aim of advancing on Madinah. They had developed a high
level of confidence against the Muslims because of what had
happened at Mu'tah, where they had taken part in the battle on the
Byzantine side. 'Amr ibn al-'AS went to their land, accompanied by
three hundred of the Muhiijireen and An$%. When he reached the
place of the enemy's gathering, he heard that they had gathered in
huge numbers, so he sent word to the Messenger of Allah (g)
asking
for reinforcements, who arrived under the leadership of Abu
'Ubaydah ibn a l - ~ a r r * . ~The
~ ~Muslims fought the disbelievers, and
'Amr penetrated deep into the land of Qudii'ah, whose people

200

The Battles ofthe Camel and S$een, and the issue of arbitration

scattered and ran away. 'Amr succeeded in reinstating the position of
Islam on the Syrian border and restoring the allies of the Muslims to
the way they had been. Other tribes also entered into an alliance with
the Muslims, and many people from the tribes of Banu 'Abs, Banu
Murrah and Banu Dhubyin became Muslim. The tribe of F a z u
and its chief 'Uyaynah ibn Husn also entered into an alliance with the
Muslims, and they were followed by Banu Sulaym, under the
leadership of al-'Abbgs ibn Mird2s and Banu Ashja'. The Muslims
became the strongest power in northern Arabia, if not in the entire
From this campaign we learn a number of lessons and issues
regarding 'Amr ibn al-'AS, including the following:
3.2.2.a. The sincerity of ' A m ibn al-'A~

'Amr said: 'The Messenger of Allah (g)
sent word to me
saying: 'Put on your garment and take up your weapon, then come to
me.' I came to him while he was making wudoo'. He looked up at
me, then he looked away and said: 'I want to send you at the head of
an army. Allah will keep you safe and grant you booty, and I hope
that you will acquire some wealth from it.' I said:'0 Messenger of
Allah, I did not become Muslim for the sake of wealth, I became
Muslim out of love for Islam and to be with the Messenger of Allah
He said: '0 'Amr, good (hala) wealth is good for the good
man,' "723

(e).'

This attitude is indicative of the strong faith and sincerity of
'Amr ibn al-'AS and his desire to be close to the Messenger of Allah
(g).
The Messenger of Allah (B)explained that ha12 wealth is a
blessing when it is possessed by a righteous man, because he is
seeking the countenance of Allah and will spend it in good ways,
such as sponsoring orphans and widows, calling people to Islam,
supporting the mujshideen, charitable projects and other good

'Ali ibn Abi TJlib

201

causes, as well as maintaining dignity for himself and his family7z4
and helping Muslims. From this hadith, we may understand that if a
person strives to acquire hala wealth, this is something praiseworthy
that was encouraged by the Prophet
If a man has wealth, and we
can manage to guide him and make him righteous, then he may
combine hala wealth with righteousness, as in this badith. This is
also something desirable and praiseworthy; it is good for him and for
Islam and the Muslims.

(a).

3.2.2.b. 'Amr's keenness to keep his troops safe
When the Messenger of Allah (@) sent 'Amr on the campaign
to Dhit as-Salisil, it got cold, but 'Amr told his troops that no one
should light a fire. When they came back, they complained about
him. He explained: "0Prophet of Allah, they were few in number,
and I was afraid that the enemy might realise that they were few in
number. I told them not to pursue the enemy lest they be ambushed."
The Messenger of Allah (@) was impressed by that.725
3.2.2.c. 'Amr's understanding of Islam
'Amr ibn al-'AS (&) said: "I had a wet dream on a cold night
during the campaign to Dhit as-Salisil. I was afraid that I would die
if I did ghusl, so I performed the dry-earth ablution, then I led my
companions in praying the dawn prayer. They mentioned that to the
Prophet (g)
and he said: '0 'Amr, did you lead your companions in
prayer when you were in a state of impurity?' I told him what had
prevented me from doing ghusl, and I said: 'I heard that Allah
says: {And do not kill yourselves [nor kill one another]. Surely, Allah
is Most Merciful to
(Qur'an 4: 29). The Messenger of Allah (g)
-smiled and did not say anything."726

(a)

This ijtihid on the part of 'Amr ibu al-'AS is indicative of his
deep understanding of Islam, his mature thinking and his subtle
derivation of the ruling from the evidence?" The scholars derived

202

The Battles of the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue ofarbitration

many rulings from this incident, but what is particularly notable7z8is
the speed with which 'Amrestablished a connection with the Qur'an,
to the point that he was able to understand matters through these
verses although he had only been a Muslim for four months. This is
indicative of his keenness to learn about the religion of Allah (g).
It
may be, and this is likely, that 'Amrhad been in touch with the
Qur'an before he became Muslim, following whatever verses he
could hear. In that case, we have another example of the greatness of
this Qur'an, which had a great impact even on the disbelievers and
made them, despite their great enmity towards the religion, try to
listen to it. We saw that during the Makkan period, and this is
supported by what we see here of his knowledge of the Qur'an when
he suggested that the Negus ask the Muslims who had emigrated to
Abyssinia about their opinion of 'Eesa ($$2%).729

3.2.3. Virtues of 'Amr
3.2.3.a. The Messenger of Allah &)
testified to his faith
The Messenger of Allah (@) said: "The people have become
Muslims, but ' A m ibn al-'ishas become a believer."730 According
to another hadith, the Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "The two sons of
al-'AS are believers: ' A m and ~ i s h 2 m . "'Amr
~ ~ ~ibn al-'ASsaid:
"The people in Madinab with the Prophet (g)
panicked and
scattered, but I saw Saim put on a sword and sit in the mosque, and
when I saw that I did the same. The Messenger of Allah (gJ
came
out and saw Saim and me, and be said: '0 people, your refuge
should be with Allah and His Messenger; why did you not do what
these two men did?"'732

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

203

3.2.3.b. The Messenger of Allah (g)
gave him
precedence over others and testified that he w a s
one of the righteous men of Quraysh
It is narrated that 'Amr ibn al-'As (&) said: "Since we
became Muslim, the Messenger of Allah (B)never regarded anyone
as equal to KhSid and me in fighting."733 It was narrated that Abu
Mulaykah said: "Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullah said: 'I heard the
Messenger of Allah (g)
say: " ' A m ibn al-'AS is one of the righteous
men of Q u r a y ~ h . " ' " ' ~ ~This is an example of the Prophet's
knowledge of people's qualities and of how to make the most of
those qualities.
3.2.3.c. Supplication of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
for him
It was narrated from Zuhayr ibn Qays al-Balawi that his
paternal uncle 'llqirnah ibn Ramthah al-Balawi said: "The Messenger
of Allah (g)
sent 'Amr ibn al-'AS to Bahrain, then the Messenger of
Allah (g)
dozed off. He woke up and said: 'May Allah have mercy
on 'Am.' We discussed which ' A m it was, then he dozed off a
second time. He woke up and said: 'May Allah have mercy on 'Amr.'
He dozed off a thiid time, then he woke up and said: 'May Allah have
mercy on 'Amr.' We said: 'Which 'Amr,
0 Messenger of Allah?' He
said: "Amr ibn al-'As.' We said: 'What about him?' He said: 'I
remembered him because every time I asked people to give in
charity, he would bring his charity and be very generous. I would ask
hLm: "Where did you get this from, 0 'Amr?', and he would say:
"From Allah." 'Amr spoke the truth; 'Amr has a great deal of good
with Allah."' Zuhayr said: "When the fitnah broke out, I said, 'I will
follow this man, of whom the Messenger of Allah said what he said,
and I never left him."'735

204

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

3.2.4. His deeds at the time of Abu Bakr, 'Umar

and 'Uthm2n (may Allah be pleased with them)
The Messenger of Allah (g)
sent 'Amr to call the two sons of
al-Jilindi, Jayfar and 'Abbzd, to Islam. He called them to Islam, and
they believed in the Prophet (g);
they allowed ' A m to collect zak2h
and judge disputes between their people, and they supported him
against those who opposed him.73hAfter the death of the Messenger
, Bakr sent 'Amr ibn al-'AS with an army to
of Allah (B)Abu
Palestine, after giving him the choice between staying in the post to
which the Messenger of Allah (g)
had appointed him or choosing
something that would be better for him in this world and the
hereafter. 'Amr ibn al-'As wrote to him, saying: "I am one of the
arrows of Islam, and after Allah, you are the one to shoot it and
collect (the arrows). So choose the strongest, most pious and best of
them and use it."737When he came to Madinah, Abu B a h (&) told
him to stay outside Madinah and camp until he had urged the people
to join him, then he sent him with an army to ria.^^' During the
Battle of Yarmook, 'Amr was in charge of the right flank, and his
participation had a great impact on the Muslim victory.
After the death of Abu Bakr (&), 'Amr remained in Syria and
played an effective role in the Islamic conquest of Syria. Along with
Shur&beel ibn Hasanah, he conquered Bees&, Tiberias and
~ j n a d e e n .He
~ ~ also
~
conquered Gaza, al-Ludd (Lad), Yubna,
'Amwh (Emmaus), Bayt Jibreen, Yafa (Jaffa), R a f a and Jerusalem.
Not only did 'Amr (&) conquer Syria; he also conquered famous
cities in Egypt. 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b
issued instructions to
'Amr ibn al-'As (&), after he had finished conquering Syria, to
march to Egypt with the troops who were with him. He set out until
he reached al-'Areesh and conquered it, and he also conquered alFarma, al-Fus&, the Fortress of Babylon, 'Ayn Shams, al-Fayyoom,
al-Ashmooneen, Akhmeem, al-Bashrood, Tanees, Dimyit

'Aliibn Abi Tilib

205

(Damietta), Toona, Daqhalah, Alexandria and other North African
cities such as Barqah, Zuwaylah, and ~ r i ~ o l i 'Umar
.~~'
testified
to his leadership qualities by saying: "Abu Abdullah should not walk
on the earth except as a leader."741

(4)

At the time of 'Uthmk (&), he was one of those who was
close to the caliph and one of his~consnltants.When 'Uthmin
was besieged, 'Amr ibn al-'As left Madinah and headed for Syria,
saying: "0 people of Madinah, anyone who stays there while this
man is killed will be humiliated by Allah. Whoever cannot support
him, let him flee." He left, and his two sons Abdullah and
Muhammad left with him, after which Hassk ibn Thgbit and many
others followed snity4' When news came of the murder of 'Uthmin
and the people's swearing allegiance to 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib, 'Amr ibn
al-'AS said: "May Allah have mercy on 'Uthmiu (&) and forgive
him." S a l h a h ibn Zanbi' al-Judhbi said: "0 Arabs, there was
between yon and the fitnah a door, so fmd another door when that
door is broken." 'Amr said: 'That is what we want, but nothing can
fix the door except a drill, a drill that can ensure justice between the
people." He left on foot, weeping and saying: "0 ' U W , I weep
for the death of modesty and religious commitment." Then he went
. ~ ~ is
~ a true picture of 'Amr (&), which is in
to ~ a m a s c u s This
harmony with his character, his biography and his closeness to
'Uthmik.

(4)

As for the distorted image that shows him as a man of personal
interests and ambitions who ran after worldly gains, this is based on
the weak and rejected report of al-Wiqidi from Moosa ibn
~ a ' ~ o o b A. 7number
~ ~ of writers and historians were influenced by
these weak reports, so they depicted 'Amr in the worst possible
manner, as in the descriptions given by M&moud Sheet Khag2b745
and 'Abdul-Kh2iq Sayyid Abu ~ i b i ~ a h 'Abbas
. 7 ~ ~ M b o u d al'Aqqid stubbornly refused to examine the chains of narration; he

206

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

insulted the intelligence of his readers by presenting an image of
Mu'iwiyah and 'Amr as opportunists who were pursuing personal
interests. All historical critics agree that the reports to which he refers
in his analysis are false, but that does not mean anything to al'Aqqid. After narrating weak and strange reports, on which no
argument can be based, he said: "Let the historical critics say what
they want about whether this conversation took place and whether
these words a e sound. Regardless of whatever is proven to be sound
or otherwise with regard to the chain of narration or the text, what
there can be no doubt about, even if all history books got together to
prove the opposite, is that the deal between the two men was a deal to
share authority and power, and the deal between them was based on
the share of authority that each of them would have. Were it not for
that, there would have been no deal."747
The true character of ' A m ibn al-'As is that of a man of
principle. He left Madinah when he found himself unable to defend
'UthmSm (&), for whom he wept bitter teas when he was killed. He
was part of the consultative committee at the time of 'Uthmh (&),
even though he was not a governor. He went to join Mu'iwiyah (&,)
and cooperated with him to fight the killers of 'Uthmin (&) and
seek justice for the martyred
The murder of 'Uthmb (&)
was sufficient to make him very angry with all those criminals who
shed blood. He thought it essential to choose a place other than
Madinah as a base for seeking vengeance against those who had the
audacity to transgress against the sanctuary of the Messenger of
Allah (g)
and slay the caliph before the people's eyes. What is
strange about ' A m getting angry for the sake of 'UthmSm (&)? If
anyone doubts this matter, then his doubt is based on fabricated
reports, which depict 'Amr as a man whose main concern was
authority and power.749

3.3. The text of the arbitration document
In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

1. This is what has been agreed upon between 'Ahi ihn Abi T%b and
Mu'iwiyah ihn Ahi Sufyin and their supporters, as they have agreed
to refer to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (ggjfor
judgement.
2. In this case, 'Ali represents the people of Iraq, both those who are
present and those who are absent, and Mu'iwiyah represents the
people of Syria, both those who are present and those who are absent.

3. We have agreed to accept the ruling of the Qur'an and adhere to
what is mentioned in the Book from beginning to end; we will do
what it commands and refrain from what it tells us to refrain from.
This is the basis of our agreement.

4. 'Ali and his supporters accept Abdullah ibn Qays as a
representative and arhitrator, and Mu'iwiyah accepts 'Amr ihn al'As as a representative and arhitrator.
5. 'Ali and Mu'iwiyah have taken from Abdullah ihn Qays and 'Amr
ibn al-'As a pledge to adhere to the covenant of Allah and His
Messenger, to take the Qur'an as their guide and not to refer to
anything else with regard to arbitration, which will be done on the
basis of what is written in the Book. With regard to that which they
do not find in the Qur'an, they will refer to the comprehensive
Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, and they will not accept anything
that goes against it or overlook the Sunnah for some specious
argument.

6. Ahdullah ihn Qays and 'Amr ibn al-'As have taken a pledge from
'Ali and Mu'iwiyah to accept their verdict, which is based on the
Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet. They have no right to
reject that or to go against it.

208

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

7. Both arbitrators are to be granted safety and security when they
give their verdict. Their lives, wealth, hair, skin, families and children
are safe as long as they do not transgress the limits, no matter who
agrees or disagrees with them, and the Ummah should support their
verdict, which is based on the Book of Allah.

8. If one of the two arbitrators dies before reaching a verdict, his party
has the right to appoint someone else in his place from among the
people of good character and piety, on the same basis as the covenant
to which his predecessor agreed.

9. If one of the two leaders dies before the set time for deciding this
matter ends, his group may appoint a man in his place with whose
character they are pleased.

10. The two parties agree, with immediate effect, to engage in
negotiations and lay down their weapons.

11. What we have mentioned in this document is binding with
immediate effect on the two leaders, the two arbitrators and the two
parties. Allah is the best of witnesses and is sufficient witness. If they
transgress the limits, then the Ummah has nothing to do with their
verdict, and their covenant is to be rejected.

12. The people are safe; their lives, families, children and wealth are
safe until the end of the set period. Weapons are to be laid aside, the
roads are to be safe, and anyone of either party who is absent is like
those who are present in this regard.
13. The two arbitrators may stay in a place in the middle between the
two camps of the people of Iraq and Syria.

14. No one should attend their meetings except with the approval of
both arbitrators.
15. The set time for reaching a verdict is the end of the month of
Ramadan. If the two arbitrators decide to reach a verdict earlier, then

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

209

they may do so. If they decide to delay it until the end of the specified
time, they may do so.

16. If they do not rule in accordance with the Book of Allah and the
Sunnab of His Prophet by the end of the fixed time, then the two
groups will resume fighting.
17. The Ummah is bound by the deal that is reached with regard to
this matter; all of the Ummah should be united against any party that
inclines to evil actions and does wrong.750

AH.^"
3.4. The famous story of the arbitration,
which is incorrect for many reasons
A great deal has been said about the story of the arbitration,
which was narrated by historians and writers on the basis that it was
true and proven, with no doubt about it. Some narrated lengthy
versions, and some summarised it; some commented on it and
derived lessons from it, basing their rulings on the contents of the
story. It is very rare to find anyone who examined it in a critical
manner. Ibn al-'Arabi did well when he rejected it in general terms,
even though he did not go into detail. This is indicative of his strong
critical sense in examining texts, because none of the texts of this
arbitration story can stand up to critical academic examination. They
are false for a number of reasons:752

All of its chains of transmission are weak. The strongest chain
by which it was narrated is that narrated by 'Abdur-Razziq and atTabari, with a chain of narration whose men are trustworthy, from azZuhri with a missing link. They said:
Az-Zuhri said: "In the morning, the people of Syria put up their
mu~hafsand called for applying what they contained, and the people
of Iraq were filled with awe, at which point they appointed the two
arbitrators. The people of Iraq chose Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, and the
people of Syria chose 'Amr ibn al-'AS. The two armies at Siffeen
parted when the arbitrators were appointed. They (the two arbitrators)
stipulated that what the Qur'an enjoined was to be followed and what

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

21 1

it forbade was to he avoided, and that they would choose what was
best for the Ummah of Muhammad (g).
They were to meet in
Doomat alJandal, and if they did not meet for some reason, they
would meet the following year in A&&.
"When 'Ali left, the Kharijites disagreed and rebelled. This was the
first time they appeared as a group, and they declared war against
him. The reason for their rebellion was that human beings had been
appointed to decide about the ruling of Allah ($1. They said that
there is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, so they fought.
"When the two arbitrators met in A&&, al-Mugheerah ihn Shu'hah
joined them, along with some other people. The two arbitrators sent
for Abdullah ibn 'Umar ibn al-Khattih and Abdullah ihn az-Zubayr,
and they came to them with many men. Mu'swiyah came with the
people of Syria, but 'Ali and the people of Iraq refused to come. AlMugheerah ibn Shu'bah said to some prominent people of Quraysh:
'Do you think there is anyone out there who can tell whether these
two arbitrators will agree on something or will never agree?' They
said: 'We do not think that anyone knows that.' He said: 'By Allah, I
think that I should he able to find that out from them when I speak to
each one on his own and discuss it with him.'
"He entered upon 'Amr ihn al-'As, starting with him. He said: '0
Ahu Ahdullah, tell me about what I am going to ask you. What do
you think of those of us who remained neutral, for we were unsure
about the matter that was clear to you, namely fighting, and we
thought that it was better to take our time until we became certain and
the Ummah became united?'" He said: 'I think of you who remained
neutral as being behind the righteous and ahead of the evildoers.' AlMugheerah left and did not ask him about anything else.
'Then he entered upon Abu Moosa and said something similar to
what he had said to 'Amr. Ahu Moosa said: 'I think you are the

212

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

wisest of people; you are what is left of the righteous Muslims.'
"Al-Mugheerah left without asking him about anything else. Then he
met with the wise people of Quraysh, to whom he had spoken earlier,
and said: 'These two will never agree on anything.'
"The two arbitrators met and talked. 'Amr ihn al-'As said: '0 Abu
Moosa, I think the first thing we should decide about is to rule in
favour of those who fulfilled their promise and against those who
betrayed, because of their betrayal.' Abu Moosa said: 'What do you
mean?' He said: 'Don't you know that Mu'iwiyah and the people of
Syria fulfilled their promise and came to the appointment that we
made with them?' He said: 'Yes.' 'Amr said: 'Write it down." So
Abu Moosa wrote it down. 'Amr said: '0 Abu Moosa, would you
like to suggest a man to be in charge of this Ummah? Tell me his
name. If I agree with it, I will follow you in that; otherwise I will
suggest a name and you should follow me.' Abu Moosa said: 'Do

did not end their meeting before trading insults; then they went out to
the people, and Abu Moosa said: 'I found the likeness of 'Amr to be
the likeness of the one of whom Allah
says: (And recite [ 0
Muhammad] to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Ayrit
[proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.], but he
threw them away# (Qur'an 7: 175).

(s)

"Then when Abu Moosa fell silent, 'Amr spoke, saying: '0 people, I
found the likeness of Abu Moosa to be the likeness of those of whom
Allah says: (The likeness of those who were entrusted with the
[obligation of the] Tawrit [Torah] [i.e. to obey its commandments
and to practise its laws], but who subsequently failed in those
[obligations], is as the likeness of a donkey which carries huge
burdens of books [but understands nothing from them]# (Qur'an 62:
5).' Each of them wrote a letter explaining his opinion to the various
regions."753

Az-Zuhri was not present at this incident, so this report is missing a
link in its chain of narration, and his reports with missing l i d s carry
no weight and cannot be taken as evidence,754as determined by the
scholars.
There is another chain of transmission, through which Ibn ' A s s i r
narrated this report with his chain of narration going back to aZuhri. It is also missing a link, and it includes Abu Bakr ibn Abi
Sabrah, of whom Imam m a d said: "He was a fabricator of
hadith."755 Its chain of narration also includes al-Wiqidi, whose
reports are rejected.7s6 This is the text of his report:
'The people of Syria lifted up the mushafs and said: 'We call you to
the Book of Allah and to rule in accordance with what it contains.'
This was a plot by ' A m ibn al-'As. They reached a deal and wrote a
document stating that they would meet at the beginning of the year in
Adhra. They appointed two arbitrators to judge between the people,
and everyone was to accept their verdict. 'Ali appointed Abu Moosa
al-Ash'ari, and Mu'iwiyah appointed ' A m ibn al-'As. Then the
people parted; 'ALi went back to Kufah with divisions and trouble
among his party. Some of his companions disagreed with him, and
the Kharijites among his party rebelled against him. They objected to
his appointing an arbitrator, and they said: 'There is no ruling except
the ruling of Allah.' Mu'iwiyah went back to Syria with his
followers in hannony and united. One year later, the two arbitrators
met in Adhr& in Sha'bib 38 AH, and the people gathered around
them. There was a discussion between them in which they agreed on
something in private, but 'Amr ihn al-'AS went against it in public.
He let Abu Moosa speak first and declare that he was deposing both
'Ali and Mu'gwiyah, then 'Amt ibn al-'AS spoke, deposing 'ALi but
affirming Mu'zwiyah. The two arbitrators and those who were with
them parted, and the people of Syria swore allegiance to Mu'iwiyah
in the month of Dhul-Qa'dah 38 AH."^'^

214

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

All of the chains of narration of Abu Makhnaf are weak because of
him. The first reason is that Abu Makhnaf Loot ibn Y&ya is weak
and not
He was a dishonest narrator and an extreme
R z d i . The second reason is that Ibn Sa'd said conceming him: "He
was weak."759 BukhG and Ahu Hgtim said: "Y&ya al-Qat&
regarded him as weak."760 'Uthmin ad-DGmi said: "He is
weak."761 An-Nas2i said: "He is weak."762
These are the versions of the well-known story of the arbitration and
the alleged debate between Abu Moosa and 'Amr ibn al-'A$. Can
proof be based on something like this, or can these reports be relied
on with regard to the history of the noble Companions and the era of
the Rightly Guided Caliphs, the most exemplary of eras? If there was
nothing wrong with these reports except some contradictions in their
texts, that would be sufficient to regard them as weak. So how about
if we add to that the weakness of their chains of narration?763

This issue is very important with regard to belief and
legislation. Despite its importance, it is not transmitted by any sound
chain of narration. It is impossible that the scholars would
unanimously ignore it, even though it is so important and there is
such a great need for it.764

There is a report which refutes these reports completely. It was
narrated in brief by Bukhari in his Tareekh, with a chain of narration
whose narrators are trustworthy. It was also narrated by Ibn 'As&r
from al-Husayn ibn al-Mundhir, that Mu'zwiyah sent him to 'Amr
ibn a~-'As,instructing him: "I have heard about 'Amr something that
I dislike; go to him and ask him about the matter conceming which
'Amr and Abn Moosa met, and what happened in their meeting."

Ahu Moosa spoke of 'Amr's piety and how he used to take
stock of himself and remember the lives of Abn Bakr and 'Umar
(may Allah be pleased with them), as well as his wonies about what
had happened after they were gone. Abu Moosa said: 'Amr ibn alsaid to me: "By AUah, if Ahu Bakr and 'Umar forsook this
wealth when it was permissible for them, is it possible that they had
an unfair deal and were wronged, or was it a misjudgement on their
part? By Allah, they did not have an unfair deal and they were not
wronged, and their decision was not based on misjudgement. By
Allah, weakness only came to us because of our deeds."766

'AS

Mu'iwiyah a f f m e d 'Ali's superiority over him and that be
was more entitled to the caliphate than him. He did not dispute with
him for the caliphate or seek it for himself during 'Ali's lifetime.
Y a y a ibn Sulaymgn tn-Ja'fi narrated, with a good chain of narration,
from Abu Muslim al-Khawlini that he said to Mu'iwiyah: "Are you
disputing with 'Ali for the caliphate or are you like him?" He said:
"No; I know that he is better than me and is more entitled (to the
caliphate). But don't you know that 'Uthmk was killed wrongfully,
and I am his paternal cousin and next of kin, who should seek
retaliation for him? Go to 'Ali and tell him to hand over the killers of
'Uthmk to us, and I will submit to his rule." They went to 'Ali and

21 6

The Battles ofthe Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

spoke to him, but he did not hand them (the murderers) over to
him?67
This is the basis of the dispute between 'Ali and Mu'zwiyah
(may AUah be pleased with them), and the arbitration was aimed at
resolving this matter of conflict, not choosing or dismissing a
Ibn Hazm said concerning this matter that 'Ali fought
Mu'2wiyah because the latter refused to carry out his instructions in
Syria, and he was the caliph who was to be obeyed. Mu'iiwiyah never
denied 'Ali's superiority and entitlement to the caliphate, but his
reasoning led him to think that bringing the murderers of 'Uthmgn to
justice took precedence over swearing allegiance to 'Ali (&), and he
thought that he was more right to seek retaliation for the murder of
'Uthmk and to speak of it than the sons of 'Uthmk and al-Hakam
ibn ~ b i l - ' & , because of his age and his ability to pursue the matter.
He was correct in that regard, but he was wrong with regard to giving
this matter precedence over swearing allegiance to the caliph?69
Understanding the dispute on this basis - which is the reality
of the dispute - highlights the extent to which the reports quoted
above about the arbitration are mistaken in the way in which they
depicted the rnling of the two arbitrators. The two arbitrators were
given authority to issue a verdict concerning the dispute between 'Ali
and Mu'iiwiyah, but the dispute between them was not concerning
the caliphate and which of them was more entitled to it; rather it had
to do with carrying out a retaliatow punishment on the murderers of
'Uthmk. This had nothing to do with the issue of caliphate at all. If
the two arbitrators had ignored this basic issue that they had been
asked to decide about, and taken a decision concerning the caliphate
instead, as the widely circulated reports claim, then what that means
is that they did not solve the disputed issue and did not understand the
issue of this case, and this is something that is very

1

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

21 7

The conditions that must be met by the caliph are good
character, howledge and wisdom to enable him to conduct his
subjects' affairs and take care of their interests. He should also be of
Qurayshi de~cent.~"These conditions were met by 'Ali (&). Was
allegiance to him valid or not? If it was valid -and there is no doubt
concerning that - and the Muh2jireen and An$&, the decisionmakers, swore allegiance to him, and his opponents confirmed that to
him, then the words of MuC2wiyahindicate that "if the caliph is not
devoid of the qualities of a leader and those who appointed him
decide to depose him, they have no right to do that according to
consensus, because once a caliph is appointed and allegiance is
swom to him, obedience to him becomes binding, and there is no
option of deposing him without a reason that dictafes that. Caliphate
cannot be effective, and the position cannot achieve the required
purpose, unless obedience is binding. If the people are given the
option of deposing the caliph because they prefer someone else, then
the caliph can never be in full control, and he will have no power or
ability. The post of caliph would make no sense at all."772
Therefore the issue is not as depicted in these reports, which
suggest that anyone who does not like a caliph may depose him. No
one has the right to depose the caliph except those who appointed
him, namely the decision makers, provided that the caliph has gone
against the conditions of his appointment. Did 'Ali (&) do anything
to make the decision-makers decide to dismiss -him from the
caliphate, when he was the Rightly Guided Caliph, in which case it
might be suggested that the two arbitrators bad agreed on that? He
did nothing until he died that might dictate dismissing him from his
post; he did nothing except act justly, stxive hard, fear Allah (g)
and
do good.773

218

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

The time when the arbitration took place was a time of fitnah,
and the Muslims were in a situation of confusion despite the fact that
they had a caliph, so how would they have ended up if the caliph was
deposed? Undoubtedly the situation would have gotten worse, but
the Companions were too wise and rational to do such a thing. Hence
it is clear that this idea is invalid according to both reason and the
texts.

'Umar ibn al-Khagib (&) limited the caliphate to the
members of the consultative committee, of whom there were six, and
the Muhijireen and An$& approved of that. This was a hint that the
caliphate should not go beyond these six men as long as any of them
were still alive. At the time of the arbitration, none of them was left
except Sa'd ibn Abi W a q q i ~who
,
withdrew, showing no interest in
any position of authority, and 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&), who held the
position of caliph and was the best of the six after 'Uthm2n (&). So
how could this matter of caliphate be passed to someone else?774

The repoas state that the people of Syria swore allegiance to
Mu'iwiyah following the arbitration. The question is, what reason
prompted the people of Syria to swear allegiance to Mu'iwiyah? The
two arbitrators did not reach any conclusion, so there was no reason
to amibute that action to the results of the arbitration. Moreover, Ibn
'Asiikir narrated, with a chain whose narrators are trustworthy, that
Sa'eed ibn 'Abdul-'Azeez a t - ~ a n o o k h ithe
, ~ ~most
~ knowledgeable
of the people about Syrian affairs,776 said: " 'Ali in Iraq was called
'Amir at-Mu'mineen', and Mu'iwiyah in Syria was called 'the
Amir'. When 'ALi died, Mu'iwiyah in Syria was called Amir al-

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

~ u ' r n i n e e n . "This
~ ~ ~text shows that allegiance was not given to
Mu'iwiyah as caliph until after the death of 'Ali. This was also the
view of at-Tabari, who said, concerning the last events of the year 40
AH: ''In this year, allegiance was sworn to MuZ2wiyah in
~ ~ l i ~ aIbn
' . Katheer
" ~ ~ ~commented on this, saying: "In other
words, when 'Ali died, the people of Syria swore allegiance to
Mu'iwiyah as caliph, because in their view there was no one left to
dispute this position with him."779 The people of Syria h e w that
Mu'2wiyah was not equal to 'Ali in terms of being qualified for the
caliphate and that it was not permissible for him to become caliph
when it was possible to appoint 'Ali (&), whose virtne, seniority,
knowledge, religious commitment, courage and all other virtues were
well known to them, just like the virtues of his brethren Ahn Bakr,
'Umar and 'Uthm2n (may Allah he pleased with them).780
In addition to that, the texts forbid swearing allegiance to a
new caliph when the first caliph is already present. Muslim narrated
in his Saheeh that Abn Sa'eed al-Khudri said: "The Messenger of
Allah (g)
said: 'If allegiance is sworn to two caliphs, then execute
the second one."'781 There are many similar texts.782It is impossible
that the Companions would have unanimously agreed to go against
that.783

Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh that Ibn 'Umar said: "I entered
upon Hafsah and said: 'You see the fitnah that is taking place among
the people, and I was not asked to get involved at all.' She said: 'Go
and catch up with them, because they are waiting for you, and I fear
that your staying away from them may lead to division."' She kept
on at him until he went. After the meeting ended, MuC2wiyahsaid:
"Whoever wants to say anything concerning this issue, let him raise
his head, for we have more right to it than him and his father."

220

Haheeb ihn Maslamah said: "Why don't you answer him?" Abdullah
said: "So I changed the way I was sitting, and I wanted to say, 'The
one who is more entitled to this position than yon is the one who
fought you and y o u father for the sake of Islam.' But I was afraid to
say something that might cause division and hloodshed and could he
misinterpreted, so instead I talked about what AUah has prepared in
paradise." Haheeb said: "AUah has protected you from causing any
fit~~ah."~'~
It may he understood that this report is referring to the time
when allegiance was sworn to Mu'iwiyah as caliph, but it does not
contain any clear indication to that effect. Some of the scholars said
that this report refers to the meeting in which al-Hasan ihn 'Ali (&)
reconciled with Mu'Zwiyah (&). Ibn alJawzi said: "This speech
was given at the time of MuZ2wiyah,when he wanted to make his son
Yazeed his heir (to the caliphate)." And Ibn Hajar said that it was at
the time of arbitration.785However, the apparent meaning of the text
supports the first two views. The words "I was afraid to say
something that might cause division and hloodshed" are indicative of
the unity that existed at the time of Mu'%wiyah,because at the time of
the arbitration there was division and dissent, not unity and
harmony .786

The real conclusion of the arbitration. There is no doubt that
the disputed issue, which the two arbitrators decided to refer to the
Ummah and to the members of the consultative committee, was
nothing other than the point of dispute between 'Ali and Mu'iwiyah,
namely the issue of the murderers of 'Uthmk. Mu'iwiyah was not
laying claim to the caliphate or denying 'Ali's right to it, as has been
established above. Rather, he refused to swear allegiance to him and
obey his instructions in Syria, since he had authority there (in reality

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

221

if not legitimately), and what helped him was the people's obedience
to him,for he had been its governor for twenty years.787Ibn Dihyah
al-Kalbi said in his book A 'lim an-Nasr al-Mubeen 31-Muf6dalah
bayna Ah1 Siffeen: "Abu Bakr Muhammad at-Tayyib al-Ash'ari al-Biqillki - said in Manciqib al-A'immah: 'The two arbitrators
Even if
never reached a decision to depose 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (4).
they had reached a decision to depose him, he could not have been
deposed unless the Qur'an or Sunnah, which were the reference
points for them both, dictated that he should be deposed, provided
that the two arbitrators both agreed to that, or until they could explain
what dictated deposing him on the basis of the Qur'an and Sunnah.
The text of 'Ali's letter stipulated that the two arbitrators should
judge in accordance with the Book of Allah from beginning to end,
and that they should not go beyond that, drift away from it, follow
their whims and desires or be biased. He took the most solemn pledge
from them that if they went beyond the Book of Allah, their verdict
would not count. The Qur'an and Sunnah confirmed his position 4s
caliph and praised him, and they testified to his sincerity, good
character, leadership, seniority in Islam, impressive efforts in jihad
against the polytheists, closeness to the leader of the Messengers,
unique qualities of deep knowledge of rulings, wisdom and the fact
that he was entitled to leadership and qualified to cany the burden of
caliphate.""88

Where the meeting was held. The appointment for the meeting
between the two arbitrators, as it says in the document, was to be in
Ramadan 37 AH, if nothing happened to prevent it, in a place
between Iraq and Syria. The place chosen was Doomat a l - ~ a n d a l , ~ ~ ~
according to trustworthy reports, and ~ d h r a h : according
~~
to other
reports which are less authentic. Perhaps the fact that the two places

222

The Bafflesofthe Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

are close to one another is the reason for the difference in the reports,
as Khaleefah ibn
said: "Adhr&, which is close to
Doomat alJandal, was also mentioned. The meeting took place at the
appointed time with no problems."792
The place where the two arbitrators met was Doomat alJandal. This is contraq to what was stated by Yaqoot al-Hamawi,
who said that the arbitration took place in A&& and mentioned as
evidence for that some reports, which he did not actually quote, as
well as some lines of poetry.793

3.4.12.
Was Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqi?~present at the meeting of the two
arbitrators? The two arbitrators met at the appointed time and place,
each of them accompanied by a few hundred people who represented
the two delegations, one group representing the people of Iraq and
the other representing the people of Syria. The two arbitrators asked a
number of prominent people from Quraysb to be present so that they
could consult them and ask for their opinions, but many of the senior
Companions, who had kept out of the fight from the beginning, were
not present. The best of these was Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqis (&), who
was not present at the arbitration; he did not want that, and he never
thought of it.794It was narrated from ' k r ibn Sa'd that his brother
'Umar went to Sa'd, who was tending his sheep outside Madinah.
When he came to him, he said: "0 my father, are you content to be
like a Bedouin, tending your sheep, while the people are disputing
power in Madinah?" Sa'd struck 'Umar on the chest and said: "Be
quiet! I heard the Messenger of AUah (g)
say: 'AUah loves the slave

who is pious, pure and not prominent.

3.5. Is it possible to learn from the
arbitration incident in resolving
conflicts among Muslim states?
From the arbitration incident, we can learn about resolving
conflicts among Muslim states by making all the leaders of Islamic
states, and hence the MusLim Ummah that they rule, face up to their
responsib~litiesby putting serious pressure on the two disputing
parties so that they will stop fighting and will resort to arbitration, as
prescribed in Islam. Thus each side may send an arbitrator to reach a
verdict concerning this dispute in light of the following:

1. Deciding the extent of their authority with regard to
issuing the verdict that is required to solve the problem
which is the cause of the conflict.
2. Making the sources of Islamic legislation the only
reference points for issuing these rulings and solutions that
could decide the issues of the dispute.
3. Taking a solemn pledge from each side involved in the
conflict, and from all the leaders of Muslim countries, to
accept the rulings and legitimate solutions issued by the
two arbitrators to put an end to the current conflict. The
decision is binding and must be executed in accordance
with the rulings of Islam; going against it, or approving of
going against it, will be regarded as a sinful action
according to Sharia.

4. If the two arbitrators issue the rulings and solutions that
they have agreed upon, and the two sides submit to that,
then the matter is settled.
5. If one or both parties refuse to accept the verdict of the two
arbitrators, any party that refuses is regarded to be the

224

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

party that was in the wrong, whether the refusal comes
from one or both of them. In that case, it is Islamically
binding upon Muslim forces in other countries to follow
the instructions and military decrees issued by the two
arbitrators to put an end to the conflict by force, by
intervening in a way that does not lead to harm or risk that
is greater than that of the current conflict.

6. Part of the authority of the two arbitrators, on the basis of
the agreement, is to issue decrees that have to do with
mobilising armed forces in other Muslim countries, so as
to resolve the current conflict in the manner described
above.796
Perhaps resorting to this method of solving conflicts among
different countries is a means of blocking foreign forces who interfere
in Muslim conflicts on the grounds that one of the parties called on
them to intervene. They take advantage of this opportunity to conspire
against the Muslims, strive to make these conflicts escalate, and
impose a solution that appeals to them and serves their interests only.
This leaves the Muslims to suffer, after that, from the consequences of
that solution in a manner that is worse than what they suffered during
the conflict itself. This suffering does not concern the foreign forces at
all; in fact, this suffering is one of the aims of the poor solutions they
offer. We say: perhaps resorting to arbitration in the manner described
above will block the way for those foreign forces which try to cause
division in the Muslim ranks. Moreover, it should be noted that the
Islamically binding nature of the solution reached through arbitration,
as we have discussed, is based on the consensus of the Companions.
The Companions, at the time of the conflict that arose between 'Ali
and MuC$wiyah,were all agreed on resorting to arbitration and
accepted it unanimously, whether these Companions were on the side
of 'Ali or on the side of MuC2wiyah,or were among those who kept

'Ali ibn Abi T61tb

225

away from both sides, such as Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqi~,Ibn 'Umar and
others (may Allah be pleased with them

3.6. Attitude of Ah1 as-Sunnah
towards these wars
The attitude of Ah1 as-Sunnab wal-Jami'ah towards this war
that took place between the Companions (&) is to refrain from
discussing what happened between them except in a manner that is
befitting to them (may Allah be pleased with them), because
deliberating about what happened among them may generate enmity,
hatred and resentment against one of the two parties. It is obligatory
for every Muslim to love all of the Companions, to ask Allah (@) to
be pleased with all of them and to have mercy on all of them, to
acknowledge their virtues and recognise tbeir great deeds and noble
character. Wbat happened between them was based only on
independent judgements (ijtiha), and they will all be rewarded,
whether they were right or wrong, but the reward of those who got it
right will be double that of those who got it wrong on the basis of
their independent reasoning. Of the Companions, both the one who
killed and the one who was killed will be in paradise. Ah1 as-Sunnah
wal-Jam2ah do not regard it as permissible to debate about the
conflict between them.
Before quoting the opinions of a number of Sunni scholars
explaining their attitude towards the dispute among the Companions,
I shall quote some texts relating to the fighting that occurred among
the Companions, to see how it was described in those texts:798

Allah (&) says: (And if two parties [or groups] among the
believers fall to fighting, then make peace between them botb. But if

226

The Battles of the Camel and Szffeen and the issue uf arbitration

one of them outrages against the other, then fight you [all] against the
one that which outrages till it complies with the Command of Allah.
Then if it complies, then make reconciliation between them justly,
and be equitable. Verily, Allah loves those who are the equitable.)
(Qur'an 49: 9)
In this verse, Allah (&) enjoins reconciliation among the
believers if fighting occurs among them. They are brothers, and this
fighting does not mean that they are no longer believers, since Allah
( B )calls them believers here and enjoins reconciliation among
them. If fighting does take place among ordinary believers, and it
does not mean that they are no longer believers, then the Companions
of the Messenger of Allah
who fought at the Battle of the Camel
and in subsequent battles are the first who should be included under
the heading of believers that is mentioned in this verse. Before their
Lord, they are still true believers, and the conflict that arose among
them does not affect their faith at all because it came about on the
basis of independent reasoning.799

(s)

It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (&) said: "The
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'There will be a group who will go
beyond the pale of Islam at the time of Muslim division, and they will
be killed by the group that is closer to the h-uth."'800
The division referred to in this hadith is the dispute. between
'Ali and Mu'iwiyah (may AUah be pleased with them both). The
Prophet (g)
described both groups as being Muslims and connected
to the truth. This hadith is one of the signs of his prophethood,
because things turned out exactly as foretold by the Prophet (g).
The
hadith also rules that both groups were Muslims, both the people of
Syria and the people of Iraq. It is not h-ue that the people of Syria
were regarded as disbelievers, as the RZcjis and ignorant folk claim.

iI

Xli ibn Abi T a b

227

This also indicates that the companions of 'Ali (&) were the closer
of the two groups to the truth. It is the view of Ah1 as-Sunnah walJamsah that 'Ali
was in the right, but that Mu'iwiyah will be
rewarded inshallah, since he acted on the basis of what he thought
was correct. 'Ali was the ruler, though, and he will have two rewards,
as is proven in Saheeh al-Bukhhr? "If the mler or judge strives to
reach a verdict and gets it right, he will have two rewards; if he strives
to reach a verdict and gets it wrong, he will have one reward."801

(4)

It was narrated that Abu Bakrah said: "While the Prophet (g)
was delivering a sermon, al-Hasan came, and the Prophet (g)
said:
'This son of mine is a leader, and perhaps Allah will reconcile two
great groups of the Muslims through him."'802
In this hadith, we see the Prophet's testimony that both the
people of Iraq and the people of Syria are Muslim. This hadith is also
a clear refutation of the Kharijites, who regarded both 'Ali and
Mu'iwiyah, and their supporters, as disbelievers; the testimony
included in this hadith is that they were all Muslims. Hence Sufyin
ibn 'Uyaynah used to say: 'We liked it very much that he referred to
the two groups as being two groups of Muslims." Al-Bayhaqi said:
"He liked it because the Prophet (gJ
called them all Muslims. This is
a case of the Messenger of Allah (g)
foretelling that after the death
of 'Ah, al-Hasan ibn 'Ali would hand the reins of power to
Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi ~ u f ~ & I . " ~ ~ ~
The hadiths mentioned above refer to the people of Iraq who
were with 'Ali (&) and the people of Syria who were with
Mu'gwiyah ibn A< sufy&I (&) The Prophet (&) described them
as being part of his ~mmah'" and also described them as all being
connected to the truth and not going beyond it. He
testified that
they would continue to be believers and would not go beyond that

(s)

228

Tke Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

because of the fighting that took place between them; they were
included in the general meaning of the verse in which Allah (&)
says: (And if two parties [or groups] among the believers fall to
fighting, then make peace between them both) (Qur'an 49: 9). We
have seen above that this verse encompasses all of them, may Allah
be pleased with them all. They did not become disbelievers or
evildoers because of that fighting; rather their actions were b a ~ e don
what they thought was correct. The ruling on their fighting was
explained by 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&), as we have seen.
What the Muslim must do with regard
to what he believes
.
about what happened among the noble Companions (&) is to follow
the way of Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jami'ah, which means refraining
- from
taking sides concerning what happened among them and not
indulging in discussing that except in a manner that befits their status.
The books of Ah1 as-Sunnah are full of explanations of their sound
and pure belief with regard to those who were chosen to be the
Companions of the Prophet (g).
Ahl asSunnah defined their
attitude towards that war that broke out among them in good terms,
such as the following:

1.

'Umaribn 'Abdul-'Azeez (may Allah have mercy on him) was
asked about the fighting that took place among the
Companions, and he said: "This is blood that Allah (%) kept
our hands free from, so why should I not keep my tongue out
of it, too? The likeness of the Companions of the Messenger of
Allah (gg)
is that of the eye; the best way to heal the eye is not
to touch it."'05 Al-Bayhaqi said, commenting on these words
of 'Umar ibn 'Abdul-'Azeez (may AUah have mercy on him):
'This is very good, because keeping quiet about what does not
concern one is the right thing to do."8"

2.

Al-Hasan al-Basri (may Allah have mercy on him) was asked
about the Companions fighting amongst themselves, and he

!

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

229

said: "That was fighting in which the Companions of
Muhammad (g)
were present, and we were not; they knew,
but we do not know. In the issues on which they agreed, we
follow; on the issues on which they differed, we refrain from
taking a stance."807
The meaning of these words of d-Hasan d-Basri is that the
Companions had more knowledge of what they got involved
in than we do. AU we have to do is follow them in that on
which they were agreed, refrain from taking a stance on that
concerning which they differed, and not introduce our own
opinion. We may be certain that they based their actions on
what they thought was correct, seeking AUah (&) thereby,
because they were sincere in their commitment to slam.^^^

3.

Ja'far ibn Muhammad as-Sgdiq was asked about what
happened among the Companions, and he replied: "I say what
Allah said: (The knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a
record. My Lord neither errs nor does He forget) (Qur'an 20:
52).

Imam &mad (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after he
was asked about what happened between 'Ali and Mu'2wiyah:
"I do not say anything about them except that which is
best."809 It was narrated that Ibr2heem ibn Ariz d-Faqeeh
said: I was with &mad ihn Hanbd when a man asked him
about what happened between 'Ali and Mu'gwiyah. He tumed
away from him, and it was said to him: "0 Abu Ahdullah, he is
a man of Banu Hhhim." So he turned towards him and recited
the verse: (That was a nation who has passed away. They shall
receive the reward of what they earned, and you of what you
earn. And you will not be asked of what they used to do)
(Qur'an 2: 141).

7he Battles of the Camel and Szffeen, and the issue of arbitration

4.

Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawini said, in the context of his
discussion about what the Muslim is obliged to believe about
the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (&) and how they
should be mentioned: "None of the Companions of the
Messenger should be mentioned except in the best way, and
we should refrain from debating about the dispute that
occnrred among them because they are the most deserving of
people of finding the best way of interpreting what they said
and did, and of being thought of in the most positive
manner."810

5.

Abu Abdullah ibn Batah said, in his discussion on the belief
of Ahl as-Sunnah wal-Jamg'ah: "Moreover, we refrain from
deliberating about the dispute that arose among the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g).
They were with
him during major events, and they have precedence over
others for that reason. Allah has forgiven them and has
enjoined you to pray for forgiveness for them and to draw
close to Him by loving them; that was enjoined on the lips of
His Prophet. He knew what would happen between them and
that they would fight; the reason they were given precedence
over all other people is because all their mistakes, deliberate or
otherwise, have been pardoned, and all their disputes have
been forgiven."811

6.

Abu Bakr ibn at-layyib al-Biqillki said: "It must be noted
that with regard to the disputes that occurred among the
Companions of the Prophet (g),
we should refrain from
examining them and ask Allah (&) to have mercy on all of
them; we praise them and ask Allah
to be pleased with
them and to grant them safety (in the hereafter), victory and
paradise. We believe that 'Ali (&) was right in what he did
and will have two rewards, and that what the Companions

(a)

X l i ibn Abi Tilib

231

(&) did was based on what they thought was best, so they

will have one reward; they are not to be regarded as evildoers
or innovators. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allah
(%) says: $Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when
they gave the Bay'ah [pledge] to you [O Muhammad] under
the tree, He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down
As-Sakeenah [calmness and tranquillity] upon them, and He
rewarded them with a near victoryB (Qur'an 48: I8), and the
words of the Prophet (g):
'If the ruler orjudge strives to reach
a verdict and gets it right, he will have two rewards; if he
strives to reach a verdict and gets it wrong, he will have one
reward.' If the judge in our time wiU have two rewards for bis
effort to reach the right judgement, then what do you think
about the effort of those with whom Allah (&) is pleased and
they are pleased with Him? The soundness of this view is
indicated by the words of the Prophet (g)
to d-Hasan (&):
'This son of mine is a leader, and perhaps Allah will reconcile
two great groups of the Muslims through him.''''
The
greatness of each of the two groups was confirmed, and it was
ruled that their Islam was sound. Allah promised to remove the
resentment from their hearts when He (g)
said: BAnd We
shall remove from their breasts any deep feeling of bitterness
[that they may have]. [So they will be like] brothers facing
each other on thrones) (Qur'an 15: 47). So we must refrain
from debating about the conflict that occurred among them
and keep quiet about it."'13
7.

Ibn Taymiyah said, when discussing the belief of Ah1 asSunnah wd-Jam?tCah concerning the conflict among the
Companions: 'They refrain from debating the conflict among
the Companions and say: 'These reports that mention bad
conduct on their part include reports to which things have been

232

The Battles of the Camel and Sifeeq and the issue of arbitration

added, or from which things have been omitted, or which have
been interpreted in the wrong way. As for those reports that are
sound, they are excused for their conduct; or they based their
conduct on what they thought was right, and they got it right;
or they based their conduct on what they thought was right, but
they got it wrong."'814

8.

Ibn Katheer said: "With regard to that concerning which they
differed amongst themselves after the death of the Prophet
some of it happened without their intending it to, such as
the Battle of the Camel; some of it was based on what they
thought was correct, such as the Battle of Siffeen. A decision
may be mistaken, but the person is excused, even if it is wrong,
he will be rewarded for it, and the one who gets it right will
have two rewards."815

(s),

9.

Ibn Hajar said: "Ah1 as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that it
is not allowed to criticise any of the Companions because of
what happened to them, even if we know who was in the right,
because they did not fight these battles except on the basis of
what they believed was right. Indeed, it is proven that (the one
who got it wrong) will have one reward, and the one who got it
right will have two rewards."*16

Ah1 as-Sunnah are unanimously agreed that it is obligatoly to
refrain from becoming too involved in examining the fimah that
occurred among the Companions after the murder of 'Uthm2n (&),
and that we should pray for mercy for them, recognise the virtues of
the Companions, acknowledge their precedence and spread reports of
their good

3.7. Waming against some books which
distort the history of the Companions
3.7.1. Al-lmimak was-Siyisak,
which is attributed to Ibn Qutaybah
One of the books that distort the history of early Islam is alIncLirnah was-Siyrisah, which is attributed to Ibn Qutaybah. Dr.
Abdullah 'Usayliin, in his book ul-Imcimah was-Siycisahji Mizcin atTahqeeq al-'Ilmi, lists a number of points proving that this book
amibuted to h a m Ibn Qutaybah is false and is a fabrication. The
evidence to that effect includes the following:

- None of those who wrote biographies of Ibn Qutaybah said that
be wrote a book on history called al-Imcimah was-Siyrisah, and
we do not know of any book of history that be wrote except for a
book called al-Ma'iiif.

- Reading through the book gives one the impression that Ibn
Qutaybah lived in Damascus and the ~ a g h r e b ; ~in
" fact, he
never left Baghdad except to go to ad-Daynoor.

- The methodology and style used by the author of al-Imimah
was-Siycisah is completely different from the methodology and
style of Ibn Qutaybah, as seen in those of his books that still
exist. f i n Qutaybah wrote lengthy introductions to his books,
explaining his methodology and his aim in writing the book. In
contrast, the author of al-lmrimah was-Siycisah writes a very
shoe introduction that is no more than three lines. In addition,
there are differences in style. We do not see this methodology in
the books of Ibn Qutaybah.

- The author of al-Imcimah was-Siyrisah narrates from Ibn Abi
Layla in a way that gives the impression that he met him. But

234

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue o f arbitration

this Ibn Abi Layla is Muhammad ibn 'Abdur-R@min ibn Abi
Layla al-Faqeeh, the judge of Kufah, who died in 148 AH. It is
well known that Ibn Qutaybah was not born until 213 AH, sixtyfive years after the death of Ibn Abi Layla.
-

The narrators and shaykhs from whom Ibn Qutaybah usually
narrates in his books are not mentioned anywhere in this book.

-

A large segment of his reports are narrated using phrases that
indicate a problem with the reports. It often says: "They
mentioned from some of the Egyptians", "They mentioned from
Muhammad ibn Sulaymin from some of the shaykhs of the
people of Egypt", "Some of the sbaykhs of the Maghreb told
us", or "They mentioned from some of the shaykbs." Such
phrases are far removed from the usual style and phraseology of
Ibn Qutaybah and are not used in any of his books.

-

The author of al-Imcimah wasSiycisah narrates from two of the
senior scholars in Egypt, but Ibn Qutaybah never went to Egypt
and never learned from these two scholars.819

-

Ibn Qutaybah is held in high esteem by the scholars, who regard
him as one of Ah1 as-Sunnah, trustwotthy in his knowledge and
religious commitment. As-Sdafi said: "lbu Qutaybah was one of
the trustworthy and one of Ah1 as-Sunnab." Ibn Hazm said
conceming him: "He was trustworthy in his knowledge and
religious commitment." Al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi said likewise.
Ibn Taymiyah said conceming him: "Ibn Qutaybah is one of the
followers of Ahmad and Ishiq and one of the supporters of the
Sunni madh-hab."'20 If a man is held in such high esteem by the
authentic scholars, does it make sense for him to be the author of
a book like al-Imamamah
was-Siycisah, which distorts history and
attributes to the Companions that which is not true?821

X l i ibn Abi Ttlib

235

Dr. 'AliNufay' al-'Aly2ni says in his book 'Aqeedat al-Imam
Ibn Qutaybah, concerning al-ZmLimah was-Siycisah: "After a critical
reading of the book al-Imcimah wasSiycisah, in my view it is most
likely that the author of al-Zmcimh was-Siycisah was an evil RZfidi
who wanted to attribute this book to Ibn Qutaybah because his books
are numerous and because he was well known among the people for
supporting Ah1 d-Hadith (the people of hadiths). He may have been
one of the RZdis of the Maghreb, as Ibn Qutaybah enjoyed a good
reputation in the ~ a ~ h r e b . " ~ ~ ~
What makes it likely that the author of al-ImLimh wasSiyesah was a RZfidi is the following:

03 The author of al-Imemah was-Siycisah claims that 'Ali(&) said
to the Muhijireen: "I urge you by Allah, 0 Mnhijireen, not to
take the authority of Muhammad among the Arabs out of his
house and honle to yours and not to deprive his family of their
rights, for by Allah, 0 Muhijireen, we are more entitled to that
because we are Ah1 d-Bayt (the members of the Prophet's
household) and are more entitled to this than you. By AUah, this
is our right; do not follow whims and desires lest you go astray
from the path of ~ l l a h . " " ~NO one believes that the caliphate is
the hereditary right of Ah1 d-Bayt except the Shia.
*:

The author of al-lmcimah wasSiyisah harshly criticises the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah. He depicts Ihn 'Umar
as a coward and Sa'd ibn Abi W a q q i ~as jealous; he says
that Muhammad ibn Maslamah got angry with 'Ali ibn Abi
T2ih because he killed the Jew Mafiab in Khaybar, and that
'kishah ordered that 'Uthmiin be killed.824Criticism of the
Companions is one of the most well-known characteristics of the
RZdis; the Kharijites do something similar, hut they do not
criticise the majority of the ~ o m ~ a n i o n s . ~ ~ ~

(4)

236

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

-3 The author of al-Imcimah was-Siycisah says that al-Mukhtir ihn
Abi 'Ubayd was killed by Mu~'ahihn az-Zubayr because he
called people to rally behind the household of the Messenger of
Allah (g),
but he neglects to mention the myths introduced by
al-Mukhtk or his claim of receiving revelation.826The R%@s
are the ones who love al-Mukhtiir ibn Ahi 'Ubayd because be
took revenge on the murderers of al-Husayn. It should also be
noted that Ibn Qutaybah (may Allah have mercy on him)
mentioned al-Mukhtk among those who rebelled against
legitimate authority, and he said that al-Mukht2 used to claim
that Jihreel (m)
came down to him.827

4 The author of al-Imrimah was-Siydsah wrote only about twentyfive pages concerning the caliphates of the three caliphs Ahu
Bala; 'Umar and 'Uthmin, whereas he wrote two hundred pages
about the fimah that occurred among the Companions. In other
words, he reduced the greatest period of history to a few pages
but wrote pages upon pages of false history, of which nothing is
proven except a little. This is one of the known attributes of the
R2fiifidis.We seek refuge with Allah
from misguidance and
betrayal.

(a)

*:

As-Sayyid Mamond Shukri al-Aloosi says in Mukhta~aralFitnah al-Zthna 'Ashariyyah: "Part of their (the R$fi@s') crafty
tricks is that they look at the names of scholars who are respected
by Ah1 as-Sunnab, and whenever they find one who has the
same name as one of their own scholars, they attribute the
reports of that Shia scholar to him (the Sunni scholar). Those
Sunnis who are unaware of this will think that this is one of their
(Sunni) imams and will accept his words and rely on his reports.
For example, as-Suddi is the name of two men, one of whom is
as-Suddi the elder and the other is as-Suddi the younger. The
elder as-Suddi is one of the trustworthy Sunni scholars, whereas

'Ali ibn Ahi Tcilih

237

the younger is one of the fabricators and liars and is an extreme
Riififidi. Abdullah ibn Qutaybah is an extreme RZidi whereas
Abdullah ibn Muslim ibn Qutaybah is a trustworthy Sunni
scholar who wrote a book called al-Ma'Zrif, that Rififidiwrote a
book which he also called al-Ma 'Zrf, with the aim of misleading
people."8z8 This is what makes it likely that the book al-Zmrimah
was-SiyZsah was written by the RififidiIbn Qutaybah and not by
the trustworthy Sunni Ibn Qutaybah; people got confused by the
similarity of names.829And AUah (&) knows best.

3.7.2. Nahj al-Baliighah
One of the books that played a role in distorting the history of
the Companions is the book called Nahj al-Balhghah. This book is
faulty in terms of both its chains of narration and its text. It was
compiled three and a half centuries after 'Ali
died, without any
chain of narration. The Shia attributed Nahj al-Balighah to ashShareef ar-Radiy, who was not accepted by the hadith scholars even
when he gave a chain of narrators, in cases where the reports support
his innovations, so how about if no chain of narration is given at all,
as is the case in Nahj al-Bal&ghah?As for the one whom the scholars
accused of lying, that is his brother ' ~ l i . ~The
~ ' scholars discussed
him and said:

(4)

- Ibn Khallikk said in Tarjamat ash-Shareefal-Murtadiy: "The
scholars differed concerning the book Nahj al-Balrighah, which
is a compilation of the words of Imam 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&),
as to whether it was compiled by 'Ali or his brother ar-Rafidiy.It
was said that these were not the words of 'Ali; rather that the one
who compiled it and attributed it to him was the one who
fabricated it. And Allah knows best."831

- Adh-Dhahabi said: "The one who studies Nahj al-BalZghah will
be certain that it is falsely attributed to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali

238

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeeen, and the issue of arbitration

(&). It contains blatant insults and criticism of Abu Bakr and

'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) as well as
contradictions, and is written in a weak and pallid style such that
anyone who knows anything about the Qurayshi Companions
and those who came after them, and their way of thinking, will
be certain that most of it is false."832
-

Ibn Taymiyah said: "The scholars know that most of the
speeches in this book are fabricated and falsely attributed to 'Ali
(&), hence we do not find most of it in earlier books, and it bas
no known chain of t ~ a n s m i s s i o n . " ~ ~ ~

-

Ibn Hajar accuses ash-Shareef al-Murtadiy of fabricating it and
says: "The one who studies it will be certain that it is falsely
attributed to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), and most of it is
false."834

Based on the above comments and others, a number of
researchers discussed this topic and said that this book cannot be
soundly attributed to Imam 'Ali
We may note some of the most important reasons why the
early and modem scholars doubted the attribution of Nahj alBaliighah to Imam 'Ali:
*:

It is devoid of documented chains of narration that would
support the attribution of its words to 'Ali.

*:*

It contains a large number of lengthy speeches, which would
bave been difficult to memorise without getting mixed up at that
time, before the era of compiling and writing things down. Even
the speeches of the Messenger of Allah (g)
bave not reached us
in complete form, despite the great deal of care and attention
given to them.

+*:

We can see many of its statements and speeches in trustworthy

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

239

sources where thay are attributed to someone other than 'Ali
(&), but the author of Nahj al-Baleghah attributes them to him.
+*:

This book contains words that criticise the Rightly Guided
Caliphs who preceded 'Ali, in a manner that is not befithg him
or them; these words contradict what is known about 'Ali's
respect for them. One example is the repoa of the speech known
as Shaqshaqiyyah, in which his keenness to become caliph is
demonstrated, even though he was known to be an ascetic who
cared little about worldly matters.

*:*

The prevalence of rhymed prose in the book. A number of
literary critics think that so much rhymed prose is not in
accordance with the spirit of 'Ali's era, when people sought to
avoid overdoing things, even though the kind of rhymed prose
that comes without mucb effort was not far removed from the
spirit of that time.

03 Writing in a very ornate manner, which is a demonstration of
literary ability. This is a feature of the 'Abhasid era, with its love
of flowery speech such as we find in the description of peacocks,
bats, bees, ants, plants, clouds and so on.
*

The philosophical style that is scattered throughout the book was
unknown to the Muslims until the third century AH, when
Greek, Persian and Indian books were translated. This is Inore
like the words of the philosophers and orators than the words of
the Companions and the Rightly Guided

We should beware of this book when talking about the
Companions and what happened between them and Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali
We should measure its texts against Qur'an
and Sunnah; whatever is in accordance with the Qur'an and Sunnah,
there is nothing wrong with referring to it, but whatever is contrary to
them, we should pay no attention to it.

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

3.7.3. Al-Agkini by al-Isfah&
The book al-Aghcini by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfah&i is regarded as
a book of literature, entertainment and poetry that is to be sung; it is
not a book of knowledge, history and Islamic jurisprudence. It is very
famous in the realm of literature and history, but that does not mean
that we should keep quiet about what is mentioned in it of
~ h u ' o o b i ~ a h ,fabrication,
~~'
blatant lies, slander and criticism. The
Iraqi poet, Professor Waleed al-A'&ami, has written a valuable hook
called as-Sayf al-Yamini fi Nahr al-Isfah6ni Scihib al-Aghini, in
which he makes a serious effort to distinguish between what is
rubbish and what may he accepted, what is poison and what is honey.
He highlights what the book contains of lies, inflammatory
shu'oobiyyah and hatred, which seethes in the heart like a boiling
cauldron. He refutes the false and unauthenticated reports that alIsfah2ni compiled, which undermine the people of the Prophet's
household and distort their history and their image. He also discusses
the false claims made by al-Isfahhi with regard to MuZ2wiyahibn
Abi Sufyin and the Umayyad Rightly Guided Caliphs, as well as the
reports that are fabricated and falsely atmbuted to them. In this
valuable hook, the great scholar and poet Professor Waleed alA'ghami also discusses other kinds of falsehood, including the
fabricated stories that undermine Islamic belief and religion and give
precedence to ignorance over ~ s l a r n . ~ ~ ~
The early scholars commented on Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahgni:
- Al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi said: "Abu al-Faraj al-Isfah2ni

was the worst of liars; he used to buy a lot of worthless
books, then all that he wrote was based on them."839
- f i n al-Jawzi said: "The reports of such a man cannot he

trusted, and you will find in his books evidence to prove
that he is an evildoer. He encourages the drinking of

I

'Ali ibn Abi Tlilib

241

alcohol and may even attribute that to himself. The one
who studies the book al-Aghini will see all kinds of
e~1s.,~840

- Adh-Dhahabi said: "I saw our Shaykh Ibn Taymiyah
classifying him as weak, criticising him with regard to his
reports and finding what was in his book outrageous."84*

3.7.4. Tareekh al-Ya'qoobi
The author's full name is &ad
ibn Abi Ya'qooh Ish2q ibn
Ja'far ibn Wahb ibn W i m . He was from Baghdad, and he died in the
year 290 AH. He was an Imami Sbia historian who worked as a
scribe in the ministries of the Abbasid state, so he was known as 'the
Abbasid scribe'. Al-Ya'qoobi presented the history of the Islamic
state from a purely Imarni Shia point of view. He did not
acknowledge the caliphate of anyone except 'Ali ibn Abi r i b and
his sons (may Allah be pleased with them), in the sequence ofImams
accepted by the Shia, and he referred to 'Mi as the rightful, appointed
heir of the Messenger of Allah (g)
When
. he spoke of the caliphates
of Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmiin (may Allah be pleased with them),
he did not give them the title of caliph; rather be said: "So-and-so
took charge." He did not mention any of them without reviling him.
He narrated bad reports about 'A'ishah (&,)
and treated other senior
.~
Companions in like manner, narrating c o G p t reports about 'Uthmsn
(&)842 and also about Khslid ibn a l - ~ a l e e d , 8'Am
~ ~ ibn a1-zAS844
and Mud2wiyahibn Abi ~
~
fHe discussed
~
k in. a very
~ negative
~
~
light the meeting in which Abu Bakr was first given the oath of
allegiance after the death of the Prophet
claiming that it was a
conspiracy to take the caliphate away from 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&)
who, in his view, was the rightful successor. His way of fabricating
false accusations is typical of the way of his fellow Shia and Rififidis;
it involves either fabricating the report altogether,847 adding

242

The Battles ofthe Camel and SiSfeen, and the issue of arbitration

, something to the report,848or quoting it out of context to distort its
meaning.

When he mentions the Umayyad caliphs, he describes them as
kings, but when he mentions the Abbasid caliphs, he calls them
caliphs. In his book al-Buldrin, he also calls their state 'the blessed
which is a reflection of his hypocrisy and practice of
taqiyyah (dissimulation). This hook is an example of the deviation
and distortion to be found in the writing of Islamic history, but it was
used as a reference by many Orientalists and westemised Muslims
who undermined Islamic history and the images of its figures. In fact,
this book is worthless from an academic point of view; the first part is
mostly filled with stones, myths and legends, and the second part is
written from a partisan point of view. It is also lacking the simplest
principles of academic a~thentication.'~'

3.7.5. Al-Mas'oodi (d. 345 AH)
The hook Murooj adh-Dhahab wa Ma'ridin al-Jawhar was
written by al-Mas'oodi, whose full name is Abu al-Hasan 'Ali ibn alHusayn ibn 'Ali al-Mas'oodi; he was one of the descendants of
Abdullah ibn Mas'ood (&).851 It was said that he was a man from
'the ~aghreb':~' but al-Mas'oodi himself stated that he was from
Iraq and that he moved to ~
~If what ~was meant
~ by 'thet
Maghreb' was the western part of the Arab world as opposed to the
eastem part, then Egypt is part of the western part of the Muslim
world, so there is no ~ontradiction.8~~
Al-Mas'oodi was a Shia, of whom Ibn Hajar said: "His books
are filled with proof that he was a Shia and ~ u t a z i l i t e . " ' ~Al~
Mas'oodi argued that the concept of the rightful, appointed heir for
the imamate was known and established from the time of Adam, and
that it was transmitted from generation to generation until the time of
our Messenger (g).
Ibn Hajar mentioned the differences among the

.

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

243

people after that with regard to whether there is a divine text or it is to
be left for people to choose, and the Imami Shia believe that there is a
text.856In his book Murooj adh-Dhuhab, Al-Mas'oodi paid a great
deal of attention to the events surrounding 'Ali ibn Abi mib (&);
he paid more attention to him than he did to the life of the Messenger
of Allah (g)
in the same book.857 He focused his attention on the
household of 'Ali (&) and followed reports on them very clearly in
his book Murooj a d h - ~ h a h u bHe
. ~ tried
~ ~ shamelessly to distort the
history of the first generation of Islam.
These are some of the classicd books that we warn against,
and which had a great impact on the writings of some contemporq
authors such a Taha Hussein (al-Fitnah al-Kubra - 'Ali wa
Banuhu) and alL6Aqq2d ((a-'Abqariycit series). They quoted
numerous fabricated and weak reports and based their analysis on
them; hence they were mistaken in their conclusions and made
serious errors concerning the Companions (&). The same is true of
'Abdul-Wahhgb m-Najjiir in his book al-Khnlafii' ar-Rcishideen,
where he quotes texts of the R%fidi reports from al-lmcimah wasSiycisah, and Hasan Ibraeem in his book 'Amr ibn al-'&, in which
he concludes, on the basis of fabricated Rsidi reports, that 'Amr ibn
al-'AS was a man in pursuit of his own interests and ambitions who
would not get involved in any matter unless he could see some
worldly interest or benefits for himself.859 There are also other
researchers who followed the same methodology and thus entered
dark tunnels because of their being far removed from the
methodology of Ah1 asSunnah wal-Jami'ah when dealing with the
huge accumulation of historical reports.

3.8. The Orientalists and Islamic history
One of the worst groups when it comes to distorting Islamic
history is the R%di Shia, of all groups and types. They were among

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen and the issue of arbitration

the earliest of the groups to emerge, and they have a hierarchical
political system and their own set of deviant beliefs and ideology.
This is the group that tells the most lies against its opponents, and
they are among the most vehemently opposed of people towards the
Companions, as we will see. Among the basic foundations of their
belief are impugning the Companions and denouncing them as
disbelievers, especially the 'two shaykhs' Abu Bakf and 'Umar (may
AUah be pleased with them), whom they refer to as 'sorcery and
The Shia have the greatest number of narrators and
storytellers who took on the mission of spreading their lies and
fabrications and compiling themin hooks and essays about the events
of Islamic history, especially internal events. Shu'oobiyyah and
tribalism also had an effect on the fabrication of historical reports and
stories aimed at distorting Islamic history and 'proving' the
superiority of one sect or people or race over another, ignoring the
Sharia criterion of superiority, namely taqwa. $Verily, the most
honourable of you with Allah is that [believer] who has At-Taqwa
[i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon (the pions)]b (Qur'an 49: 13).
The deviant sects took advantage of the prevalence of
storytellers, the ignorance and lack of knowledge of the Sunnah on
the part of most of the people, and the fact that some of them had
drifted away from the truth while seeking to earn a living. They
spread their lies and fabricated stories, which these storytellers
welcomed and spread among the common folk, without realising the
situation. Hundreds of fabricated reports about the Companions,
Tsbi'oon and Muslim scholars, which undermined them and
distorted their history, were disseminated through them. But by His
grace and blessing, Allah
guided a number of scholarly critics,
who strove hard to examine the narrators and narrations,
distinguishing between true and false and defending the beliefs and
history of the Ummah. The Sunni scholars put a great deal of effort

(s)

i

'Aliibn Abi Ttlib

245

into pointing out the fabricated reports by quoting them and
highlighting those narrators who were weak, suspicions, or followers
of whims and desires. They drew up a methodology for examining
the reports and determining which to accept, and they were
successful in these efforts.
Among the most prominent of those who took on the mission
of explaining historical errors and pointing out flaws in the false
reports were: al-Q2di Ibn al-'Arabi in al- 'Awcijim min al-Qawiijim;
Imam ibn Taymiyah in many of his books and essays, especially his
valuable book Minhrij as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah ji Naqd Kalcim
ash-Shia ~n~al-Qadardyyah;
the critic adh-Dhahabi in many of his
historical writings such as Siyar A'lcim an-Nubala', Tareekh al-Islam
and Mizcin al-l'tidcilj'? Naqd ar-Rijcil; al-~i?fi&'~' Ibn Katheer, the
interpreter of Qnr'an and historian, in his book al-Bidtyah wanNih6yah; d-HZdh
-Ibn Hajar al-'Asqall2ni in his books Fath al-Bciri
.fi Sharh Saheeh al-Bukhciri, Lisrin al-Mizrin, Tahdheeb at-Tahdheeb
and al-Ijcibah j'? Ma 'rifat aj-Sahribah.
With regard to the methods used by the Shia to distort the
historical events and images of the early generation of the
Companions and Tsbi'oon, there were many ways, including:
*+: Outright fabrications and Lies
*:*

Mentioning a true story or incident, but adding or omitting
details so as to distort it and give the opposite idea.

*:*

Quoting reports out of context, so that the meaning is
distorted, and a false interpretation of events is given.

*

Highlighting shortcomings and mistakes while concealing
well-established facts.

*+: Fabricating poetry and attributing it to some poets, in order
to support some so-called historical events, because

246

The Battles of the Camel and Slffeen, and the issue of arbitration

Arabic poetry is regarded as a historical document and
proof that helps to authenticate reports.
*:*

Fabricating books and essays and falsely attributing the111
to scholars and well known characters, as the RStfidis
fabricated the hook al-Imiimah wasSiycisah, which they
attributed to Abu Muhammad Abdullah ibn Muslim ibn
Qutaybah ad-Daynooribecause he was famous among and
trusted by the Sunnis, as we have seen above.

In the last century, these lies and distortions were welcomed
by Western scholars and writers, such as Orientalists and
missionaries, during the period in which they invaded and colonised
Muslim counmes. They found in this material what they were
looking for, and they started to highlight it and focus on it. Motivated
by their fanaticism and hatred of the Muslims, they added lies by
inventing events that never happened or misinterpreting historical
events, purposely distorting and misinterpreting the facts to support
their beliefs. This group was then supported by a large number of the
students of the Orientalists from Arab and Muslim countries, who
adopted their research methodology and their ideas and concepts for
analysing and interpreting history; they took up the banner after the
Europeans depmted from the Muslim lands. Thus the harm that they
did was worse and greater than that of their Orientalist teachers and
their predecessors among the misguided and innovating groups. That
is because they, like their teachers, claimed to be following a pure
academic spirit and scientific method in research by giving up any
and all preconceptions, but in fact most of them gave up nothing hut
their faith.
They had no sincerity towards the truth and no knowledge of
following a sound academic methodology in proving historical
events, such as comparing reports, knowing the value of the sources
to which they were refeniug and the extent to which the narrators

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

247

were authentic and accurate, and studying the context of those
narrators in terms of human nature and development.862They did not
learn anything of scientific or academic methodology except for
superficial matters such as how to write footnotes and put together
bibliographies, and so on. This is probably what scientific
methodology meant to them.863Muhibb ad-Deen al-Khateeb said:
"Those who received a foreign education are controlled by the
illusion that they are disconnected from that past, and their attitude
towards its figures is like that of a public attorney towards the
accused. Indeed, some of them even went to extremes to appear in
front of others as if they had no connection with any part of Arab and
Muslim history, following in the footsteps of the Orientalists with
their suspicious views of the past. They have a sense of contentment
and follow their whims and desires, at the time when fairness dictates
that they should verify the matter, in order to reach a conclusion and
feel at ease with it before they have enough evidence to prove it."864
One of the most important means by which the Orientalists
and their students sought to distort the facts of Islamic history is:
Misinterpreting historical events on the basis of modem
concepts and ideas and in accordance with whatever crossed their
minds, without even verifying the historical events in the fust place
and without paying any attention to the historical context in which
the event took place, the people's circumstances at that time, or the
beliefs that were guiding them and that they were following. Before
discussing any event, it is essential to first verify that it took place;
the fact that it is mentioned in some book is not sufficient to prove
it.865 The stage of verifying precedes the stage of discussing and
interpreting historical events.
The interpretation should also be in accordance with the
wording of the historical report, as well as the context of the research
and the general nature of the society, era and environment in which

248

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen,and the issue of arbitration

the event took place. This interpretation of the historical event should
not contradict another incident or series of incidents that are proven
to have happened. Examination of an event should not be limited to
one aspect only, as is the habit of many contemporary schools of
thought when studying history; instead, all the factors that have an
impact on the event should be scrntinised, especially ideological and
intellectud factors. Even after paying attention to all of the above, the
interpretation of historical events is no more than a human effort,
which may be right or wrong. Some have given prominence to the
history of misguided groups and hied to exaggerate their role,
depicting them as reformers who were wronged or oppressed. They
have tried to suggest that Muslim historians were unfair to groups
like the Qariirnitah, Isma'ilis, I m h i Rifidis, Fitimids, Zanj, Ikhw211
as-Safa and the Kharijites. In the view of these historians, all of these
groups were advocates of reform, justice, freedom and equality, and
their uprisings were aimed at putting an end to injustice and
oppression.
This propaganda against Islamic histoly, and trying to crowd
out the biographies of heroes and callers to Islam with the
biographies of the leaders of misguided groups, is something that
comes as no surprise from people who are not Muslims, because they
are motivated by their own beliefs and aims to plot against Islam with
all possible efforts by night and day, in secret and openly. One cannot
expect people who have no faith and who belong to the disbelieving
groups to do anything other than to support their brothers in
misguidance.
What some may find strange however is that after the collapse
of Orientalism, the banner of distortion was taken up by writers who
have Muslim names and are Muslims, who tried to spread this poison
among their fellow Muslims so as to divert the ignorant away from
the straight path. These writers rely on dubious, weak, worthless

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

249

reports which they pick up from literature, fairy stories, folktales and
weak or falsely attributed books. These books are what they use as
proof, along with what they find of fabricated reports in at-Tabari and
al-Mas'oodi, even though they know that they are not regarded as
reliable academic references. This transgression against and
distortion of Islamic history - especially the history of the early
generations - has been done by a number of means, namely:
(a) Choosing and focusing on particular events, such as battles
and wars, and depicting them incorrectly so as to take
away the idea of jihad for the sake of Allah (&), or
focusing on events and internal turmoil with the aim of
presenting the dispute among the Companions (&) as if it
were a typical example of conflict and political scheming
like those of modem times.
(b) Concealing and ignoring everything that could set a good
example and motivate people.

(c) Shedding doubt by targeting history and its celebrated
figures, as well as the Muslim historians themselves, and
casting aspersions on their knowledge and authenticity.

(d) Fragmenting Islamic history into small, disparate parts as
if there is no connection between them, such as dividing
Islamic history on the basis of regions, race and so on.

AU of these means are attempts to destroy our Islamic history
and its beautihl features, and to prevent it from becoming a good
example to follow and a means of sound education.
Hence the Muslim historians have to know about these things
and be wary of them. They should also be aware of those who
followed the Orientalists in their views and methodology, and they
should not accept anything from them except with great caution. If

250

The Battles of the Camel and Siffeen, and the issue of arbitration

our scholars (may Allah have mercy on them) criticise many
narrators of history and regard their reports as weak because they
quote from the People of the Book and their Jewish and Christian
sources, then we should he equally cautious in accepting the views
and interpretations of those who learned from the Orientalists. As a
matter of fact, we should reject and disregard them unless there is
clear proof to support them.866

'Ali's attitude towards the
Kharijites and Shia

1. The Kharijites
1.1.Origin and definition of the Kharijites
%e
scholars have defined the Kharijites in several ways.
According to Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari, the name Kharijites was
given to the group that rebelled against the fourth Rightly Guided
Caliph 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib
He said: "The reason why they are
called Khanjltes is because of their rebellion (khuroo~]against 'Ali
when he agreed to arbitration."'

(4).

Ibn Hazm stated that the name Kharijite applies to everyone
who resembles the group that rebelled against 'Ali ihn Abi T%b
(&) and who shares their beliefs. He said: "Whoever agreed with
the Khanjites in rejecting the arbitration, regards anyone who
commits a major sin as a disbeliever, says that the people should
rebel against unjust rulers, believes that people who commit major
sins wlll abide in hell forever, and thinks that the caliph may be other
than a Qurayshi, is a Kharijite. If he differs with them with regard to
other issues concerning which the Muslims d~ffered,and he differs
with them concerning the issues mentioned above, then he is not a
~harijite."~

252

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Ash-Shahrastiini defined the Kharijites in general terms and
for any era, saying: "Anyone who rebels against the rightful ruler of
the Muslims, on whom they are agreed, is called a Kharijite, whether
that rebellion took place at the time of the Companions against the
Rightly Guided Caliphs or it happened after that against those who
followed them in truth and the rnlers of every era."3
Ibn Hajar said concerning them: "The Kharijites are those who
objected to 'Ali (&) for appointing arbitrators, disavowed him and
'Uthmh and his descendants, and fought them. If they regard them
~
another definition,
as disbelievers, then they are e ~ t r e m e . "Giving
he said: 'The Kharijites are a rebellious group. They are innovators
who were given this name because of their rebellion (khurooj)
against Islam and against the best of the ~ u s l i m s . " ~
Ahu al-Hasan d-Malti thinks that the first Kharijite group was
al-Muhakkimah, whose slogan was "There is no rnling except the
ruling of Allah
They said that when 'Ali (&) agreed to
arbitration and gave Abu Moosa d-Ash'ari the authority to rule and
judge, 'Ali (&) committed an act of disbelief, because there is no
ruling except the rnling of Allah (&). The Kharijites were so called
because of their rebellion (khurooj) against 'Ali (&) at the time of
arbitrati~n.~

(s)."

Dr. Nisir al-'Aql says: "They are those who regard people as
disbelievers for committing sins and those who rebel against unjust
r~lers."~
So the Kharijites are those people who rebelled against 'Ali
(&) after he agreed to arbitration following the battle of Siffeen.

They have other names by which they are also known, such as the
~ a r o o r i ~ aash-Shur?ih~
h,~
d-Mkiqah and al-~uhakkimah.'~
They
accepted all of these names except the name al-M&iqah (the
renegades); they did not accept that they were renegades 60m Islam
who passed out of the faith as the arrow passes out of the prey."

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

253

Some scholars suggest that the origins of the Kharijites go
back to the time of the Messenger (g),
and they recognise DhulKhuway~irahas the first of the Kharijites. He objected to the way the
distributed some gold that 'Ali (&) had
Messenger of Allah (g)
sent to him from Yemen. It is narrated from Abu Sa'eed d-Khudri
(&) that he said: " 'Ali ibn Abi T&b (&) sent to the Messenger of
Allah (@) some gold from Yemen in a tanned leather bag that had
not been purified of the earth clinging to it. He shared it out among
four men: 'Uyaynah ibn Hvn, al-Aqra' ibn Hibis, Zayd d-Khayl
and the fourth, who was either 'Alqamah ibn 'Ulithah or ' h i r ihn
at-Tufayl. One of his companions said: 'We had more right to it than
these men.' News of that reached the Prophet (g),
who said: 'Do you
not trust me, when I am the trustee of the One Who is above the
heaven, and the news of heaven comes to me morning and evening?'
A man with sunken eyes, prominent cheeks, a prominent forehead, a
thick beard and shaven head stood up, tucking up his waist wrapper,
and said: '0 Messenger of Allah, fear AUah!' He said: 'Woe to you!
Am I not the one who should fear AUah the most among the people of
earth?' Then the man turned and left, and Kh&d ibn d-Wdeed (&)
said: '0 Messenger of Allah, should I not strike his neck (kill him)'?'
He said: 'No, perhaps he prays.' K h Z d said: 'How many of those
who pray say with their tongues what is not in their hearts?' The
Messenger of Allah
said: 'I have not been commanded to check
people's hearts or split open their belLies (meaning checking what is
in their hidden thoughts).' Then he looked at the man as he was going
back, and he said: 'From among the progeny of this man will emerge
people who recite the Book of Allah fluently, but it will not go any
further than their throats. They will pass out of the faith as an mow
passes out of the prey.' He [the narrator] said: I think he said: 'If1 live
to see them, then I will certainly kill them like the killing of

(a)

ha mood.""^

Ibn al-Jawzi said, commenting on this hadith.. '"The first of the
Kharijites, and the worst of them, was Dhul-Khuway~irah atTameemi. According to one version, he said to the Prophet (@), 'Be
fair,' and the Prophet ( g ) repbed: 'Woe to you! Who will be fair if I
am not fair?'13 This was the first Kharijite to rebel in Islam. His
problem was that he was content with his own opinion, but if he had
thought carefnlly, he would have realised that no opinion could
supersede that of the Messenger of Allah ( g ) . The followers of this
man are those who fought 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (&)."14
Among those who suggested that Dhul-Khuway~irahwas the
' ~ ashfirst of the Kharijites were Abu Muhammad ibn ~ a z m and
Shahras&i, in his hook al-Milal wan-~iha1.l~
Some scholars think
that the Kharijites originated at the time of the rebellion against
'Uthmin (&), when they stirred up the fitnah that led to his being
killed wrongfully and unlawfully; the unrest that they stirred up was
called 'the fmt fitnah'.17 The commentator on at-Tahhciwiyyah said:
"The Kharijites and the Shia emerged during the first fitnah."18Ibn
Katheer labelled as Khxijites the thugs who rebelled against and
killed 'Uthm2n (&), and he said when discussing them after their
slaying of 'Uthmk (&): "The Kharijites came and seized the wealth
of the public treasury, in which there was a great deal of ~ e a l t h . " ' ~
The most correct opinion about the origins of the Kharijites,
despite the strong connections between Dhul-Khuway~irahand the
thugs who rebelled against 'Uthmk (&) on the one hand, and the
Kharijites who rebelled against 'Ali (4)
because of the arbitration
on the other, is that this terminology -in the most accurate sense of
the word -can only be applied to those who rebelled because of the
arbitration. They were an organised group who formed a sect with its
own political inclinations and views, and the group had a clear
ideological and intellectual impact, which was not the case in the
previous incidents?'

1.2. Hadiths which criticise the Kharijites
There are many hadiths from the Prophet 1%) which criticise
the renegade Kharijites; they are described in these hadiths as having
the most reprehensible characteristics, which make them the worst of
people. Among the hadiths in which they are criticised is that which
was narrated by the two shaykhs (Bukhari and Muslim) in their
Saheehs from Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (&I:
"While we were with the
Messenger of Allah (@
-)
: and he was sharing out some wealth, DhulKhuway~irah, a man from Banu Tameem, came and said: '0
Messenger of Allah, be fair!' The Messenger of Allah (g)
said:
'Woe to you! Who will be fair if I am not fair? I will be doomed and
lost if I am not fair.' 'Umar ibn al-Khagih (&) said: '0 Messenger
of Allah, give me permission to strike his neck.' The Messenger of
Allah (g)
said: 'Let him be, for he has companions in comparison to
whose prayer one of you would regard his prayer as insigniticant, and
he would regard his fasting as insignificant in comparison to their
fasting. They recite the Qur'an, but it does not go any further than
their collarbones. They will pass out of Islam as an arrow passes out
of the prey; when he looks at the tip of it, there is nothing on it; then
he looks at the sinews (which tie the arrowhead to the shaft), and
there is nothing on them; then he looks at its base, and there is
nothing on it; then he looks at its featlie~s,and there is nothing on
them, because it has gone too fast to be smeared with excrement or
blood. Their sign will he a black man, one of whose upper arms will
be like a woman's breast or like apiece of quivering flesh. They will
emerge when there is division among the people.'" Abu Sa'eed said:
"I bear witness that I heard this from the Messenger of Allah (g),
and I bear witness that 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) fought them when I
was with him. He ordered that that man be sought, and he was found
and brought. I looked at him and saw that be was just as the
Messenger of Allah (g)
had described him."21

256

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites andShia

The two shaykhs (Bukhari and Muslim) also narrated from
Abu Salamah and 'Ata' ibn Yask that they came to Abu Sa'eed alKhudri and asked him about the Harooriyyah, saying: "Did you hear
the Messenger of Allah (@J mention them?" He said: "I do not know
who the Harooriyyah are, but I heard the Messenger of Allah (&J
say: 'There will emerge among this Umrnah' - and he did not say:
from them - 'people in comparison to whose prayer you will regard
your prayer as insignificant. They will recite the Qur'an, but it will
not go any further than their throats. They will pass out of Islam like
an arrow passes out of the prey; then the archer looks at his mow, at
its tip and at its end and its notch, wondering whether there are any
traces of blood on it."'"
Bukhari narrated that Usayd ibn 'Amr said: "I said to Sahl ibn
Hunayf: 'Did you hear the Prophet (@) say anything about the
Kharijites?' He said: 'I heard him say, pointing towards Iraq: "There
will emerge from it people who recite the Qur'an, but it does not go
any further than their collarbones. They will pass out of Islrun as the
mow passes out of the prey.""'
In these three hadiths, there is clear condemnation of the
Kharijites. The Prophet (g)
-- described them as a group of renegades
who will be inappropriately strict in religion; in fact, they will pass
out of it, meaning that they will enter it and then leave it quickly, and
no part of it will adhere to them. The first of these hadiths also says
that they will fight the group that is in the right, that the group that is
in the right will destroy them, and that among them will he a man
whose arm is like such and such. AU of that happened as foretold by
the Prophet

(a).

With regard to the words "it does not go any further than their
collarbones," there are two interpretations. It may mean that they do
not understand it with their hearts, so they interpret it in a way that
was not meant, or it may mean that their recitation will not be taken
up to Allah (3g).Z3

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

257

One of their blameworthy characteristics, for which the
Messenger (g)
criticised them, is that all they have of faith is mere
lip service. Because their reasoning is weak and poor, and their
understanding is incorrect, they recite Qur'an and think that it
supports them, when in fact it is against them. Bukhari (may Allah
have mercy on him) narrated that 'Ali (&) said: "If I narrate to you a
hadith from the Messenger of Allah (@J,by Allah, being dropped
from heaven would be dearer to me than telling a lie about him. But if
I tell you of something that is between me and you, then war is deceit,
and I heard the Messenger of Allah (g)
say: 'There will emerge
some people at the end of timez4who are young in age, feebleminded
and foolish. They will quote from the best of words, but their faith
will go no further than their throats, and they will pass out of Islam as
the arrow passes out of the prey."'z5
In these two hadiths, the Kharijites are criticised for having
mere words instead of true faith. The fust hadith indicates that their
belief is verbal only and that they do not believe in their hearts.26III
the latter hadith, which was narrated by Zayd ibn Wahb al-Juhani
from 'Ali , .. the word 'faith' refers to prayer. Both hadiths
indicate that their faith is a matter of words only, and that it goes no
further than their throats or collarbones. This is the worst ~riticism.~'

(A),

Another of the reprehensible characteristics for which the
Prophet (g)
criticised them is that they will pass out of Islam and
will never be guided to retnm to it, and he said that they are the worst
of creation. Muslim (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated from
Abu Dharr (&) that the Prophet (g)
said: "After me, there will be
among my Ummah people who recite the Qur'an, but it does not go
any further than their throats. They will pass out of the faith as an
m o w passes out of the prey, then they will not return to it. They are
the most evil of mankind and of all creation."" He narrated from
Abu Sa'eed that the Prophet (B)mentioned some people among his

258

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shia

Ummah who would rebel as a group, and whose characteristic feature
was that they would have shaven heads. He said: "They are the most
evil of mankind - or among the most evil of mankind - and they
will he killed by the group that is closer to the truth."
Another of the characteristics for which they were condemned
by the Messenger of Allah ( g ) is that they are the most hated of
creation to Allah. It is narrated in Saheeh Muslim from 'Ubaydullah
ibn Abi Rat, the freed slave of the Messenger of Allah ( g ) , that he
was with 'Ali ibn Ahi T%b (&) when the Harooriyyah rebelled.
They said: "There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah." 'Ali said:
'These are tme words being used for false purposes.29 The
Messenger of Allah ( g ) described some people, and I recognise their
characteristics in these people: 'They will speak the truth on their
lips, but it will not go any further than this,' - and he pointed to his
throat - 'and they are the most hated of Allah's creation to Him.
Among them will be a black man, one of whose arms is like the teat
of a sheep or a nipple."' When 'Ali ihn Abi Taib (&) killed them,
be said: "Look (for that man)." They looked but did not fmd
anything. He told them two or three tlmes: "Go hack, for by Allah, I
did not lie, nor was I lied to." Then they found the man in a ruin, and
they brought him and placed him before 'Ali (&). 'Ubaydullah said:
"I was present when that happened, and 'Ali said that to them."30
Another of the blameworthy characteristics for which they
were criticised by the Messenger of Allah (g)
was that they were
deprived of knowing the truth and being guided to it." Muslim
narrated in his Saheeh, in the hadith of Usayd ihn 'Amr from Sahl ibn
Hunayf, that the Prophet (g)
said: "Some people from the east, who
have shaven heads, will he misguided."32 An-Nawawi said that this
means that they wiU go astray from the right path and the path of
tmth.33

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

259

Another of the reprehensible characteristics that the Prophet
(g)
said would be manjfested in them is that they regard it as a
religious duty to kill the Muslims while they spare those who worship
idols and the cross.34 The two shaykhs (Bukhari and Muslim)
narrated in their Saheehs that Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri said: "When he
was in Yemen, 'Ali (&) sent some gold, still encased in earth, to the
Messenger of Allah ( g ) , and the Messenger of Allah (@) shared it
out among four men ... There came a man with a thick beard,
prominent cheeks, sunken eyes, a prominent forehead and a shaven
head, who said: 'Fear Allah, 0 Muhammad!' The Messenger of
Allah ( g ) said: 'Who will obey Allah if I disobey Him? Would He
trust me with the people of earth, but you do not trust me?' Then the
man turned and left, and a man who was among the people asked for
permission to kill him. (They think that he was Khilid ibn alWaleed.) Then the Messenger of Allah
said: 'Among the
progeny of this man will be people who will recite the Qur'an, but it
will not go any further than their throats. They will kill the people of
Islam and leave the idol worshippers alone. They will pass through
Islam as an arrow passes through the prey. If1 live to see them, then I
will certainly kill them like 'Ad."'35

(a)

This prediction is a marvellous miracle of the Messenger (B)
because they behaved as he foretold; they wielded their swords and
killed the Muslims, but they spared the disbelievers - the Jews and
~ h r i s t i a n s ~ ~as we shall see below.
-

Another sign of the corruption of the Kharijites is reflected in
the fact that the Messenger (B)encouraged killing them when they
appeared. He said that if he lived to see them, he would eradicate
them by killing them as 'Ad and Thamood were eradicated, and he
said that the one who killed them would have a reward with Allah
( B )on the Day of Resurrection. Allah (&) bestowed upon the
fourth Rightly Guided Caliph, 'Ali ibn Abi Tsib, the honour of

260

'Ali's azitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

fighting and killing them, because they emerged during his reign as
the Prophet (g)
described them. 'Ali (&) went out to meet the
Kharijites with the army that he had prepared to take to Syria; he
attacked them at NahrawZn, and fewer than ten of them survived, as
we shall see below. He did not fight them until they had shed blood
that was protected by Sharia and attacked the property of the
Muslims, then he fought them in order to defend against their
aggression and because of what they had demonstrated of their evil
actions and words.
The hadiths that we have quoted criticising the Kharijites are
sufficient; there are so many hadiths criticising them that hardly any
books of hadith are devoid of such reports.37 We will discuss below
how they started to gather in Haroora', how Ibn 'Abbh debated with
them, and how Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was keen to enlighten
and guide them, as well as the reasons for the battle of Nahrawin and
its consequences. We will also discuss the basic beliefs of the
Kharijites and whether Kharijite thought still exists among people,
what its causes are and how it should be dealt with.

1.3. The gathering of the Kharijites in Haroora'
and the debate of Ibn 'Abbgs with them
The Kharijites split in a large group from 'Ali's army on the
way back from Siffeen to Kufah. According to one report, they
numbered more than ten thousand; other reports put the number at
twelve th~usand,~'
eight thousand39or fourteen thousand.40There is
also a report saying that they were twenty thou~and,~'
but this report
was narrated without any chain of t r a n ~ m i s s i o nThese
. ~ ~ people split
from the army in several stages before reaching Kufah, which was a
cause of wony and alarm for the companions of 'Ali (&). The
caliph marched to Kufah with those in his army who remained loyal

X l i ibn Abi Trilib

261

to him. 'Ali (&) became preoccupied with the Kharijite issue,
especially after he heard about them organising their group by
appointing one man to lead the prayers and another man to lead the
fighting. Their view that allegiance was to be given to Allah
as
well as their emphasis on enjoining what is good and forbidding what
is evil, meant a practical split from the main body of the Muslims.

(s),

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&,) was also keen to bring them
back to the main body of Muslims, so he sent Ibn 'Abhb to debate
with them. Ibn 'AbhL himself narrated what happened: "I went out
to them wearing the best suit that Yemen had to offer, and I entered
upon them in a house in the middle of the day." Ibn 'Ahbis was a
handsome and good-looking man. "They said: 'Welcome, 0 Ibn
'Abbis; what is rhis suit?' 1 said: 'Why are you criticising me? I saw
the Messenger of Allah (B)wearing the best kind of suit, and the
words (Say [O Muhammad]: Who has forbidden the adornment with
clothes given by Allah, which He has produced for His slaves, and
At-Tayyibzt [allkinds of Hal& (lawful) things] of food?) (Qur'an 7:
32) were revealed.'
"They said: 'What brings you here?' I said: 'I have come to
you from the Companions of the Prophet (g),
the Muhijireen and
An$%, and from the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet (g),
among whom the Qw'an was revealed and who have more
knowledge of its interpretation than you. None of them is among you,
so I need to convey to you what they are saying and to convey to
them what you are saying.' A group of people took me aside, and I
said: 'Tell me what you are upset about with regard to the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
and his cousin.' They
said: 'There are three things.' I said: 'What are they?' They said:
'Firstly, he left the judgement or decision to men concerning a matter
of religion, and Allah says: 4The decision is only for Allah.) (Qur'an
6: 57). What does man have to do with decisions and ruling?'

262

'Ali's anitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

"I said: 'This is one; what is the second?' They said: 'He
fought and did not take the womenfolk of his opponents captive or
take any booty. If they are disbelievers, we should be allowed to take
their womenfolk captive; if they are believers, it is not permissible to
take their womenfolk captive or to fight them.'
"I said: 'This is the second; what is the third? They said: 'He
erased his title of Amir al-Mu'mineen [in the arbitration document].
If he is not the leader of the believers, then he is the leader of the
disbelievers.' I said: 'Do you have anything else? They said: 'That is
all.' I said to them: 'If1 bring evidence to you from the Book of Allah
(&) and the Sunnah of His prophet (g)
to answer your questions, do
you think that you will recant?' They said: 'Yes.'

"I said: 'With regard to what you said about him leaving the
judgement or decision to men concerning a matter of religion, I shall
recite to you from the Book of Allah to show that Allah delegated His
ruling and decision to men with regard to something worth onequarter of a dirham, and Allah (%) instructed them to issue a ruling
concerning it. Do you not see that Allah ( B )says: $0you who
believe, kill not the game while you are in a state of &rim [for hajj or
'umrah (pilgrimage)], and whosoever of you kills it intentionally, the
penalty is an offering, brought to the Ka'bah, of an eatable animal
[i.e. sheep, goat, cow] equivalent to the one be killed, as adjudged by
two just men among you) (Qur'an 5: 95)? This verse refers to
something concerning which men are to judge. I adjure you by Allah,
is the ruling or decision of men with regard to reconciling between
people and sparing their blood more important than the ruling on a
rabbit? They said: 'Yes, this is more important.'
"I said: 'Concerning a woman and her husband, Allah (%)
says: $If you fear a breach between them twain [the man and his
wife], appoint [two] arbitrators, one from his family and the other
from hers) (Qur'an 4 35). 1 adjure you by Allah, is the ruling or

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

263

decision of men to bring reconciliation between people and spare
their blood more important than their ruling or decision concerning a
woman and her husband? Have I answered this point?' They said:
'Yes.'

"I said: 'With regard to your saying that he fought and did not
take the women captive or take any booty, would you take your
mother 'A'ishah (F&) captive and regard (intimacy with) her as
permissible like anyother woman, when she is your mother? If you
say, "We regard (intimacy with) her as permissible Wce any other
woman," then you have become disbelievers, and if you say, "She is
not our mother," you have become disbelievers. (The Prophet is
closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their
[believers'] mothers [as regards respect and marriage].) (Qur'an 33:
6). Either way, it is misguidance, so how could you answer this?
Have I answered your point?' They said: 'Yes.'
"I said: 'As for your saying that he has erased the title of Amir
d-Mu'mineen, I shall quote to you something that you will accept.
On the day of Hudaybiyah, the Prophet made a treaty with the
polytheists. He said: "0 'Ali, write: This is what was agreed by
Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah." They (the disbelievers of
Quraysh) said: "If we accepted that you were the Messenger of Allah,
we would not have fought you." The Messenger of Allah (@Jsaid:
"Erase it, 0 'Ali.0 Allah, You know that I am the Messenger of
Allah. Erase it, 0 'Ali,and write: 'This is what was agreed by
Muhammad ibn Abdullah."' By Allah, the Messenger of Allah is
better than 'Ali, and he erased it. Erasing this title does not mean that
he gave up prophethood. Have I answered this point?' They said:
'Yes.'
'Two thousand of them recanted, hut the rest of them
continued their rebellion and fought on the basis of their
misguidance, and the Muhgjireen and An& killed them."43

264

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

We can learn a number of lessons from the debate of Ibn
'Abb2.s with the Kharijites:

1.3.1. Making a good selection when choosing
the one who is going to debate with opponents
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) chose his cousin Abdullah ibn
'Abbk, who was a scholar of the Ummah and an interpreter of the
Qur'an. The people he was going to debate were known for being
well-versed in the Qur'an; they relied for their guidance on the
Qur'an and the way they interpreted it, so the one who was most
qualified to debate with them was the one who was most
knowledgeable of the Qur'an and its interpretation. We might say
that Ibn 'Abbk (&) was the one who was specialised in this kind of
debate, because of his sincere intention towards Allah (&), his
shunning of whims and desires, his patience and forbearance, his
deliberation, his gentle approach to his opponents, his ability to listen
properly to all opponents and avoid getting into arguments, and the
clarity of his proof and the strength of his evidence.

1.3.2. Starting the debate by noting
the points that are agreed upon
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&) and his
opponents, the Kharijites, were agreed on adhering to the Book of
Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad (g).
Hence
Abdullah ibn 'AbbB (&) said to them: "If I bring evidence to you
from the Book of AUah (s)
and the Sunnah of His prophet (g)
to
answer your questions, do you think that you will recant?" In this
way, Abdullah ibn 'Abbh (&) tried to get agreement with them on
this issue before starting the debate.

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

265

1.3.3. Knowing what arguments
the opponents have
Knowing the opponents' arguments, having a complete list of
them and being prepared before starting the debate, is important. We
assume that before the debate with them, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) knew their arguments and discussed with his companions how
to answer them.

1.3.4. Refuting the opponents' claims
one after another
This is done so that they will not have a leg to stand on, as is
clear from the words of Ibn 'AhhL (&) in his debate with them.
Every time he finished refuting one point, he said: "Have I answered
this point?'

1.3.5. Before starting the debate,
saying something that helps to reach
the right conclusion for the sake of h-uth
Ahdullah ihn 'Abhis (&) said at the beginning, before the
debate: "I have come to you from the Companions of the Prophet
(g),
the Muhijireen and Ans2r, and from the cousin and son-in-law
of the Prophet (g),
among whom the Qur'an was revealed and who
have more knowledge of its interpretation than yon. None of them is
among you ...,144

1.3.6. Showing respect for the views
of the opponents during the debate
This is so that they will he more inclined to listen to and
respect whatever he has to say. This is what we see in the debate
between Ibn 'Ahhh and the ~ h a r i j i t e s . ~ ~

266

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

1.3.7. Allah guided thousands of those people
The number of Kharijites who were present at the battle of
Nahrawk was fewer than four thousand, as we shall see below. They
realised the trnth, and their confusion was dispelled by the grace of
Allah and by what Ibn 'Abbis (&) had been given of knowledge,
strength of argument and the ability to explain things clearly. The
falseness of their argument became clear to them by means of proper
interpretation of the verses on which they were basing their
arguments, and by means of the Sunnah of the Prophet, which
explains the meanings of the noble ~ u r ' a n . ~ ~

1.3.8. The words of Ibn 'AbbSs (4):
"None of them is among you"
This is a clear statement on the part of Ibn 'Abbh (&) that
not one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah ( g )
was with
them, and none of the Kharijites disputed that fact. This report is
sound and proven. As far as I know, there is no one among the Sunni
scholars who said that any of the Companions of the Messenger of
Allah (g)
were with the Kharijites. As for the claims that some of the
Companions were with the Kharijites, that is the claim of the
Kharijites themselves, but they have no documented academic proof
for what they say.

1.3.9. Defining the reference point
(for solving the problem)
Ibn 'AbbL (&) said: "If I bring evidence to you from the
Book of Allah (&) and the Sunnah of His prophet (g)
to answer
your questions, do you think that you will recant?" They said yes.
These words of Ibn 'Abb2s (&) offer an important lesson,
which is that the reference point with the debaters should be defined
so that it will be possible to reach a sound outcome to the debate.

1.4. Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) goes out to
debate with the remainder of the Kharijites,
and his policy on dealing with them after
they came back to Kufah then rebelled again
After the debate of Ibn 'AhbL with the Kharijites, in which
two thousand of them responded to him,Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) himself went out to them to speak to them, and they came back
to Kufah. This period of calm did not last long, though. The
Kharijites understood from 'Ali (4)
that he had changed his mind
about arbitration and had repented for his mistake, as they saw it, and
they began to broadcast this claim among the people. Al-Ash'ath ibn
Qays al-Kindi came to 'Ali and said to him: "The people are saying
that you have recanted disbelief for them." 'Ali (&) gave a sermon
on the next Friday in which he praised and glorified Allah (&) and
reminded them how they had split from the people and the issue over
which they had split from him.47
According to one report, a man stood up and said: "There is no
ruling except the ruling of AUah." Then another one stood up and
said the same thing, then others stood up in different parts of the
mosque repeating the same slogan. He gestured with his hand for
them to sit down and said: "Yes, there is no ruling except the ruling
of Allah. This is a word of tmth intended for a false purpose. I am
waiting for the d i n g of Allah concerning
From the minbar,
he started gesturing for them to he quiet, but some of them started
putting their fingers in their ears and saying: (If you join others in
worship with Allah, [then] surely, [all] your deeds will be in vain, and
you will certainly be among the losers) (Qur'an 39: 65). Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (4)
responded by saying: (So be patient [0
Muhammad]. Verily, the promise of AUah is true; and let not those
who have no certainty of faith discourage you from conveying
Allah's Message [which you are obliged to convey].) (Qur'an 30: 60).

268

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Amir al-Mu'mineen announced his just policy towards this
extremist group, telling them: We can grant you three things:

1. We will not prevent you from praying in this mosque.
2. We will not withhold your share of this fay' as long as you
are with us.
3. We will not fight you unless you fight us.49
Amir al-Mu'mineen granted them these rights as long as they
did not fight the caliph or rebel against the main body of the Muslims;
at the same time, they could maintain their own interpretation within
the framework of Islamic belief. Initially, he did not regard them as
being outside of Islam, so he granted them the right to be different
without that leading to division or fighting.50
Amir al-Mu'mineen did not throw the Khaijites in jail or send
spies against them or limit their freedom, but he was keen to establish
proof and show the truth to them and to others who might be
deceived by their views and pious appearance. He instructed the
muezzin to let the pious worshippers come to him but not to admit
anyone who had not memorised the Qur'an; thus the house was filled
with people who had memorised the Qur'an. He called for a large
mushaf and started tapping it with his hand, saying: "0 mushaf, tell
the people." The people called out: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, how can
you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we can speak on the basis of
what we understand from it."
He said: "These companions of yours who rebelled, between
them and me is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book
concerning a woman and her husband: (If you fear a breach between
them twain [the man and his wife], appoint [two] arbitrators, one
from his family and the other from her& (Qur'an 4: 35). The Ummah
of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than
a woman and her husband.

Xli ibn Abi Tiilib

269

"They got angry with me when I wrote, on a document
between Mu'Swiyah and me, "Ali ibn Abi T a b ' [without adding the
title 'Amir al-Mu'mineen']. But we were with the Messenger of
Allah (g)
when he made a peace deal with Quraysh at Hudaybiyah,
and the Messenger of Allah (g)
dictated, 'In the name of Allah, the
Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.' Suhayl ibn 'Amr said: 'Do not
write, "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most
Merciful."' The Prophet (g)
said: 'What should I write?' Suhayl
said: 'Write: "In Your name, 0 AUah."' The Messenger of Allah (@J
said: 'Write it,' so I wrote it. He said: 'Write: "This is what was
agreed by Muhammad the Messenger of AUah."' Suhayl said: 'If I
accepted that you were the Messenger of Allah, I would not have
opposed you.' So he wrote: 'This is what was agreed by Muhammad
ibn Abdullah with Quraysh.' And AUah ($) says: 4Indeed in the
Messenger of Allah Muhammad] you have a good example to
follow for him who hopes for [the Meeting with] AUah and the Last
Dayb (Qur'an 33: 21).~'
When the Kharijites became certain that Amir d-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) was determined to send Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari (4)
as an
arbitrator, they asked him to give up this idea. 'Ali (&) refused to do
so. He explained to them that this could be regarded as a betrayal and
breaking of a covenant and promise, since a covenant had been
drawn up with the people, and Allah (&) says: QAnd fulfil the
Covenant of AUah [Bai'ah: pledge for Islam] when you have
covenanted, and break not the oaths after you have c o n f i e d them
- and indeed yon have appointed Allah your surety.%(Qur'an 16:
91).

The KhanJites decided to split from Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) and appoint their own amir, or leader. They gathered in the
house of Abdullah ibn Wahb ar-RLibi, who addressed them in an
eloquent speech, reminding them of the insignificance of this world

270

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

and encouraging them to seek the hereafter and paradise. He urged
them to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil; then he said: "Let
us leave this town, whose people are wrongdoers, and go to the
villages in the mountains or some of these towns, objecting to these
unjust rules." Then Harqoos ibn Zuhayr stood up and said, after
praising Allah (B):
(The conveniences of this world are few, and
soon one will depart from it, so its adornments or pleasures should
not make you want to stay in it or distract you from seeking truth and
opposing wrongdoing. 'Truly, Allah is with those who fear Him
keep their duty unto Him], and those who are Muhsinoon [gooddoers]') (Qur'an 16: 128). Hamzah ibn S i n k dal-sadi said: "0
people, what yon say is right and you speak the truth, so appoint a
man from among you to be in charge, for you need a leader and a
banner to rally behind and refer to." They sent word to Zayd ibn
Husn at-Ti'i, who was one of their prominent figures, and offered
him the position of leader, but he refused. Then they offered it to
Harqoos ibn Zuhayr, then to Hamzah ibn Sink, then to Sburayh ibn
Abi Awfa d-'Abbsi; they all refused. They offered it to Abdullah ibn
Wahb ar-Rkibi, and he accepted it, saying: "By Allah, I am not
accepting it for worldly reasons, and I will never give it up for fear of
death."5z
They also gathered in the house of Zayd ibn Husn at-Ti'i asSanbeesi, who addressed them and urged them to enjoin what is good
and forbid what is evil. He recited verses of Qur'an to them,
including:

(0 Diwood [David]! Verily, We have placed yon as a successor on
the earth, so judge you between men in truth [and justice] and foUow
not your desire - for it will mislead you from the path of AUah.
Verily, those who wander astray from the path of Allah [shall] have a
severe torment, because they forgot the Day of Reckoning.)
(Qur'an 38: 26)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

271

(And whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, such are
the Kiifiroon [i.e. disbelievers -of a lesser degree as they do not act
(Qur'an 5: 44)
on Allah's Laws].)
4And whosoever does not judge by that which Allah has revealed,
such are the @rilimoon [polytheists and wrongdoers - of a lesser
degree].)
(Qur'an 5: 45)
BAnd whosoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, [then]
such [people] are the Fcisiqoon [the rebellious, i.e. disobedient (of a
lesser degree)] to ~1lah.B
(Qur'an 5: 47)
Then he said: "I bear witness against our people who turn to the same
qiblah as us, that they have followed their whims and desires and
rejected the ruling of the Qur'an and done wrong in word and deed.
Fighting them is the duty of the believers." A man named Abdullah
ibn Shajarah as-Sulami wept, then he urged those who were with him
to fight the people, saying: "Strike their faces and foreheads with the
sword until the Most Gracious, Most Merciful is obeyed. If yon
prevail and Allah is obeyed as you want, He will give you the reward
of those who obey Him and follow 11.% commands. If you fail, what is
better than ending up with the pleasure of Allah and His paradise?'
Ibn Katheer said, after mentioning what Satan inspired them to
say, as cited above: "These kinds of people are among the strangest
of the sons of Adam. Glory be to the One Who created variety among
people as He willed and decreed. How splendid are the words of one
of the early generation concerning the Kharijites: They are the ones
who are mentioned in the verses in which Allah ($1 says: $Say [ 0
Muhammad]: Shall We tell you the greatest losers in respect of [their]
deeds? Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they
thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds. They are those
who deny the Ayit [proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.] of their Lord and the Meeting with Him [in the

272

'AIi's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

hereafter]. So their works are in vain, and on the Day of Resurrection,
We shall assign no weight for them3 (Qur'an 18: 103-105)"
What is meant is that those ignorant people, who were
misguided in both word and deed, agreed to rebel and split from the
Muslims, to march to certain towns in order to gain control of them
against the inhabitants' wishes and then fortify themselves there, then
to send word to their brethren, and others of their ilk in Basra who
shared the same opinions and beliefs, to come and join them there.
Zayd ibn H u ~ nat-T2i said to them: "You cannot gain conk01 of the
cities, because annies are stationed there and will keep you out. Make
an agreement with your brethren to meet at the bridge over the River
Jookhi. Do not leave Kufah in groups; go out individually so that no
one will pay any attention to you." They wrote an open letter to those
who were following their path in Basra and elsewhere and sent word
to them telling them to meet them at the river so that they could be
united against other people.
Then they departed, sneaking out one by one, lest anyone
realise and prevent them from leaving. They departed from among
their fathers and mothers, uncles and aunts, leaving behind all their
relatives. In their ignorance and lack of knowledge, they believed that
this would please the Lord of the heavens and earth. They did not
realise that it was a serious mistake, an act of wrongdoing, and a major
sin that would doom them to hell. They did not realise that it was
something that had been made attractive to them by the accursed
Satan, who had been cast out of heaven and who took our father Adam
(m)and his progeny as enemies as long as their souls were still in
their bodies. Some people realised what their children and brothers
were up to, so they stopped them and rebuked them. Some of them
turned back to righteousness and continued on that path, but others
fled after that to join the Kharijites and thus were doomed until the
Day of Resurrection. The rest went to the specified place and were

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

273

joined by those &om B a a and elsewhere to whom they had written.
They all met at Nahrawin and became powerful and strong.53
After the two arbitrators parted without reaching a deal, Amir
al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
wrote to the Kharijites who were gathered
, ..
in Nahrawin. He gave them the news and said: "...So come back to
us, and let us march to fight the people of Syria." They refused to do
that, saying: "Not until you testify that you committed an act of
disbelief and repent," and 'Ali (&+) refused to do thaLS4According
to another report, they wrote to him saying: "You did not get angry
for your Lord's sake; you got angry for your own sake. If you testify
that you committed an act of disbelief and you turn to repentance, we
will think about the issue between us; otherwise there is no deal
between us, and Allah does not love the treacherous." When he read
their letter, be despaired of them and thought that he should leave
them alone and go with the people to Syria until he met them and
fought them."
The issue of the Kharijites regarding 'Ali (&) as a disbeliever
and asking him to repent cannot be proven from these reports, but it is
in accordance with Kharijite views regarding 'Aliand 'Uthmin as
disbelievers and testing people with regard to that issue.'=

1.5. The battle of Nahrawsn, 38 AH
1.5.1. The cause of the battle
The conditions that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) had
stipulated for the Kharijites stated that they should not shed blood,
terrorise people, or engage in banditry by attacking people on the
roads. If they committed any of these transgressions, then he would
declare war on them. Since the. Kharijites regarded those who
disagreed with them as disbelievers, whose blood and wealth they
thought were permissible for them, they started to shed the blood of

274

'Ali's attitude towards the Khnrijites and Shia

people whose lives were protected in Sharia. There are numerous
reports that speak of them committing h a r h actions.
One sound report was narrated by an eyewitness who had been
one of the Kharijites and later left them. He said: "I accompanied the
people of the river (the Kharijites), then I turned against them, but I
concealed that for fear that they might kill me. While I was with a
group of them, we came to a village, and between us and the village
was a river. A man came rushing out of the village in fear, dragging
his upper garment, and they said to him: 'Have we scared you?' He
said: 'Yes.' They said: 'Don't be scared.' I said: 'By Allah, they
know this man, but I do not know him.' They said: 'Are you the son
of Khabb;b, the Companion of the Messenger of AUah (g)?
He
'
said: 'Yes.' They said: 'Do you have a hadith you can tell us from
He said: 'I heard him say that he
your father from the Prophet (g)?
heard the Prophet @) mention fitnah and say: "The one who is
sitting at that time will be better than the one who is standing, and the
one who is standing will be better than the one who is walking, and
the one who is walking will be better than the one who is running. If
you live to see that time, then he the slave of Allah who is killed."'
'They seized him and his slave woman and took them with
them. One of them passed by a fruit that had fallen from a tree, and he
took it and put it in his mouth. Another of them said: 'It is fruit that
belongs to dhimmis; how can you regard it as permissible?' So the
first man took it out of his mouth. Then they passed by a pig, and one
of them stmck it with his sword. Another of them said: 'It is a pig that
belongs to a dhimmi; how can you regard it as permissible?'
"Abdullah ibn Khabbib said: 'Shall I not tell you about what is
more serious and h a r k than this?' They said: 'Yes.' He said:
'Killing me.' They took him to the river and strnck his neck, and I
saw his blood flowing on the water like a shoelace thrown in the
water, until it disappeared.57Then they called for the slave woman,

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

275

who was pregnant, and they slit her belly open. I never accompanied
any people whose company was more abhorrent to me than them, and
when I found an opportunity, I fled."'58
This action spread fear among the people and showed the
extent of their terror, as they slit open the belly of this woman and
slaughtered Abdullah like a sheep. They did not stop there, though;
they started threatening to kill people until some of their own number
objected to what they were doing and said: "Woe to you! We did not
leave 'Ali for this."59
Despite the evil atrocities committed by the Kharijites, Amir
al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) did not hasten to fight them. Instead, he sent
word to them t e l h g them to hand over the killers so that the hadd
punishment might be carried out on them. They responded with
stubbornness and arrogance, saying: "All of us are killer^."^' He
marched towards them in the month of Mnlpmam in 38 AH, with the
m y that he had prepared to fight the people of ria.^' He camped
on the western bank of the river of Nahrawin, and the Kharijites
camped on the eastern bank, level with the city of ~ a h r a w % n . ~ '

1.5.2. Amir al-Mu'rnineen 'Ali (&)
encourages his army to fight
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) reaIised that these people were
the Kharijites whom the Messenger of Allah (@) had pedickd
would pass out of Islam. During their march towards them, he began
to urge his companions to fight them. The hadiths of the Messenger
of Allah (g)
about the Khaijites had an effect on the Companions
and the followers of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&).
. . 'Ali (&) urged
his army to start with these Kharijites, and he said: "0 people, I heard
the Messenger of Allah (g)
say: 'There will emerge some people
from my Ummah who will recite the Qur'an, and your recitation
$auld seem insignificant in comparison to theirs, your prayer would

seem insignificant in comparison to theirs, and your fasting would
seem insignificant in comparison to theirs. They will recite the
Qur'an, thinking that it is in their favour, when in fact it is against
them, and their prayer will not go any further than their collarbones.
They will pass out of Islam as an arrow passes out of the prey.' If the
army that encountered them knew what has been decreed for them on
the lips of their Prophet (g),
they would rely upon that action. The
sign is that there is a man among them who has an upper arm but no
forearm, and the end of his upper arm is like a nipple with white
hairs. You will go to Mu'iwiyah and the people of Syria, and you
will leave these people to look after your families and wealth. By
Allah, I believe that these are the people in question, for they have
shed forbidden blood and raided the flocks of the people. So march
forth, in the name of Allah."63

(4)

'Ali
said on the day of Nahrawsn: "I have been
commanded to fight the renegades, and these are the renegades.""
The army was camped opposite the Kharijites, separated from
them by the river of Nahrawh. 'Ali (&) ordered his army not to
start the fighting until the Kharijites crossed the river towards the
west. He sent his messengers, urging them by Allah to recant. He sent
al-Bara' ibn 'Azib (&) to them, calling them for three days, but they
refused.65 Messengers kept coming and going until they killed his
messengers and crossed the river.66
The Kharijites went so far that aU hope of any reconciliation
and avoiding bloodshed was lost. They stubbornly and arrogantly
refused to come back to the trntb and insisted on fighting, so Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) organised his army and prepared to fight6' He
put Hajar ibn 'Adiyy in charge of the right flank, Shabath ibn Rab'i
and Ma'qil ibn Qays ar-Ky@i in charge of the left flank; Abu
Ayyoob al-An$%i in charge of the cavalry and Abu Qatiidah d-An&i
in charge of the infantry. Qays ibn Sa'd ibn 'Ubidah was put in charge

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

277

of the people
. of Madinah, who numbered some seven hundred. 'Ali
(&) ordered Abu Ayyoob al-AnsG to raise a banner of safety for the
Kharijites and to say to them: "Whoever comes to this banner will be
safe; whoever goes to Kufah or al-Mad2in will be safe. We are not
after any of yon except those who killed our brothers." Many of their
groups left, some four thousand in total. There were no more than one
thousand men who remained with Abdullah ibn Wahb ar-R2sibi to
wage war on 'Ali
Zayd ibn Husn at-T2i asSanbeesi was in
charge of their right flank, Shurayh ibn Awfa was in charge of their
left flank, Hamzah ibn S i n k was in charge of their cavalry; and
Harqoo~ibn Zuhayr as-Sa'di was in charge of their infantry. They
stood to confront 'Ali
and his companions.68

(4).

(4)

1.5.3. The outbreak of fighting
The Kharijites marched towards 'Ali (&). 'Ali (&,) sent his
cavally ahead of his army, with the archers in front; the infantry
marched behind the cavalry. He instructed his companions: "Do not
fight until they start it."
The Kharijites came, saying: "There is no d i n g except the
ruling of Allah. Today is the day of departure to paradise." They
charged at the cavalry whom 'Ali (&) had sent forth and scattered
them, with some of 'Ali's cavalry moving to the right and some to the
left. Then the archers started shooting their mows and striking their
faces. Some of the cavalry came back at them from the right and the
left. The infantry started attacking them with spears and swords,
smashing the Kharijites, who ended up trampled beneath the horses'
feet. Their leaders, Abdullah ibn Wahb, Harqoo~ibn Zuhayr,
Shurayh ibn Awfa and Abdullah ibn Sakhbarah as-Sulami were
killed.69 Abn Ayyoob said: "I stabbed one of the Kharijites with a
spear, which came out through his back. I said to him: 'Receive the
tidings of bell, 0 enemy of Allah!' He said: 'Yon will come to know
which of us is more deserving of it."'70

278

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Many of the Kharijites withdrew from the fighting because of
something they heard from their leader Abdullah ibn Wahb ar-Rgsibi,
which indicated that there was no certainty about their cause. When
'Ali (&) struck one of the Kharijites with his sword, the Kharijite
said: "How beautiful it is to depart to paradise." Abdullah ibn Wahb
commented: "I do not know whether it is to paradise or to he11."~'A
man from Banu Sa'd, whose name was F m a h ibn Nawfal alAshja'i, said: "I only joined them because I was impressed by that
leader, but I could see that he was in doubt." So he withdrew with a
number of his companions. Almost one thousand of them joined Abn
Ayyoob d-An$&, and the people started sneaking away.72
The battle was short and decisive, taking a brief period of time
on 9 Safar 38 AH."^ This swift battle resulted in the deaths of large
numbers among the Kharijite ranks and the exact opposite in the
m y of Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4).
According to a report
narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh, and from Zayd ibn Wahb, the
number of 'Ali's companions who were killed was only
According to another report with a reliable chain of narration, he
said: "Of 'Ali's companions, twelve or thirteen were killed."75
According to a sound report, Abu ~ a j l a said:
z ~ ~"Only nine of the
Muslims - meaning the army of 'Ali - were killed. If you wish,
you may go to Abu ~arzah~'and
ask him, for he was there."78 With
regard to the number of Kharijites slain, the reports state that all of
them were killed.79Al-Mas'oodi stated that a small number, no more
than ten, managed to escape, after a crushing defeat."

1.5.4. Dhul-Thadyah, or 'the deformed one',
and the effect of his killing of the army of 'Ali (&)
There are different reports about the identity of Dhul-Thadyah,
some of these reports are weak in terms of their chains of narration,
and others are strong. In the hadiths of the Prophet (g),
there are

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

279

descriptions of Dhul-Thadyah. Some reports say that he was black
skinneds1 or, according to one report, an Abyssinian. They say that
he had a deformed arm,meaning that it was incomplete and short; it
extended only from the shoulder to the elbow, with the forearm
missing. At the end of the elbow, there was something that looked
like a nipple, with some white hairs on it. The upper am1 was not
steady; it wobbled as if there was no bone in it.' With regard to this
man's name, those who said that Dhul-Thadyah was Harqoo~ihn
Zuhayr as-Sa'di were mistaken.83Harqoo~was a well-known man
who played a role in the Islamic conquests. Later he rebelled against
' U t W n (&), and he fled following the lesser Battle of the Camel,
in which az-Zuhayr and T a a h killed the murderers of ' U t h d
(&) in Basra. Harqoo~became one of the prominent leaders of the
~harijites,'~
but it was narrated in one report that his name was
Harqoos and that his father was unknown. According to another
report, his name was M%k, and they looked for him. When they
found him, 'Ali (&) said: "Allrihu akbar. Is there anyone who can
tell you who his father is?" The people started saying: "This is Milik,
this is M%k." 'Ali (&)
But no one knew.
.. said: "Son of
According to a report classified as sound by at-Tabari, his
name was Nz' Dhul-Thadyah, as narrated by Ibn Ahi Shayhah and
Ahn Diwood; their chains of narration are the same, and what is
narrated in the three sources is regarded a s three reports with one
, .,
had spoken of the K h ~ j i t e since the
chain of narrati~n.'~'Ali (&)
beginning of their innovation, and he frequently mentioned DhulThadyah, describing him and stating that he was a sign of these
people. After the end of the decisive battle, 'Ali (&) instructed his
companions to look for the body of 'the deformed one', because the
presence of his body would be one of the signs that 'Ali (&) was in
the right and following the truth. After searching for a while, 'Ali
(&) and his companions came to a heap of bodies piled one on top
of the other on the riverbank. He said: "Bring them out." They found

280

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

the deformed man underneath all of them, lying directly on the
ground. 'Ali (A)said, "Allcihu akbar," then said: "Allah spoke the
truth, and His Messenger conveyed it." He performed the prostration
of thankfulness, and the people said Alliihu akbar and rejoiced when
they saw him.87

1.5.5. 'Ali's treatment of the Kharijites
Amir al-Mn'rnineen 'Ali (&) treated the Kharijites as
Muslims, both before and after the battle. No sooner had the battle
ended but he issued orders to his troops, saying: "Do not pursue
anyone who is fleeing, do not finish off anyone who is wounded, and
do not mutilate anyone who has been killed." Shaqeeq ibn Salamah,
who was known as Abu WPil, one of the jurists of the Tibi'oon who
was present with 'Ali during his battles, said: " 'Ali did not take any
female prisoners either on the day of the Camel or on the day of
ahr raw in."^^ After the battle of Nahrawh, he took the property of
the slain to Kufah and said: "Whoever recognises anything, let him
take it." The people started taking things until there was one pot left,
then a man came and took its9 'Ali (&) did not divide anything
among his troops except what the Kharijites had brought into battle
with them: weapons and horses only.
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) did not regard the Kharijites as
disbelievers. Before the battle, he tried to bring them back to the main
body of Muslims, and many of them did come back. He exhorted
them and reminded them of the seriousness of fighting. Ibn Q u d h a h
said: "He did this because his aim was to restrain them and fend off
their evil, not to kill them. If it was possible to achieve this by talking,
that should take precedence over fighting because of the harm that
may be caused to both parties as a result of fighting. This indicates
that the Kharijites were a group of Muslims, as was stated by many of
the scholars."90

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

281

Sa'd ibn Abi WaqqG (&) called them evildoers (fisiqoon).It
was narrated that Mu$'& ibn ~ a ' dsaid: "I asked my father about this
verse; are they the Harooriyyah (Kharijites)?: #Say [O Muhammad]:
'Shall We tell yon the greatest losers in respect of [their] deeds?
Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they thought
that they were acquiring good by their deeds.') (Qur'an 18: 103-104).
M y father said: 'No, they are the People of the Book, the Jews and the
as
Christians. As for the Jews, they disbelieved in Muhammad (g);
for the Christians, they disbelieved in paradise and said, "There is no
food or drink there." The verses that refer to the Harooriyyah are:
B ~ n dHe misleads thereby only those who are Al-Fzsiqoon [the
rebellious, disobedient to Allah]. Those who break Allah's Covenant
after ratifying it, and sever what Allah has ordered to be joined [as
regards Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheism, and to practise its
laws on the earth and also as regards keeping good relations with kith
and kin], and do mischief on earth, it is they who are the losers.#
(Qur'an 2: 26-27)."' According to a report narrated from Sa'd, when
he was asked about them, he said: "They are people who turned away
(from the path of Allah), and Allah turned their hearts away (from the
right path)."91
'Ali (&) was asked whether they were disbelievers. He said:
"They have fled from disbelief." He was asked: "Are they
hypocrites?" He said: "The hypocrites only remember Allah a little."
He was asked: "What are they?" He said: "They are people who
transgressed against us, so we fought them." According to another
report: "They are people who transgressed against us, therefore we
prevailed over them." According to a third report: "They are people
upon whom a fitnah came, and they became blind and deaf."'"~li
(&) also offered this advice to his army and to the Muslim Ummah
after him: "If they go against a just ruler, then fight them, but if they
go against an unjust ruler, do not fight them, because they have a
reas~n."'~

282

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

(4)

It may be noted that 'Ali
regretted and was grieved by
the fighting in the Battle of the Camel and Siffeen, while he
expressed satisfaction and contentment about fighting the Kharijites.
Ibn Taymiyah said: "The texts and scholarly consensus differentiate
between the two cases. He fought the Kharijites on the basis of a text
from the Messenger of Allah (g)
and was happy about that, and
none of the Companions objected to that. As for his fighting on the'
day of Siffeen, he showed a great deal of sorrow and regretted it.""

1.6. Rulings of Islamic law resulting from
the battles of A& al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) managed, on the basis of his
abundant knowledge and deep understanding, to set out some
principles or rulings which form Sharia guidelines on fighting
transgressors who rebel against legitimate authority. Sunni scholars
and jurists based their rulings on the way he dealt with transgressors
and rebels, and they derived d i n g s and guidelines from his rightlyguided conduct in this area. The majority of scholars say that if it
were not for the wars of 'Ali (&) against those who opposed him,
we would not know the proper Sharia way of fighting transgressors
and rebels from among the ~ u s l i m s'Ali
.~~
(&)himself said: "What
do you think (would happen) if I was not there? Who would be able
to manage the Muslims' affairs or treat them the way I am treating
t h e r n ~ ~ ~ ~ l - said
~ h ntoa 'Ali:
f
"0 'Ali,our people in Basra are
claiming that if you prevail over them tomorrow, you will kill their
men and take their women captive." He said: "That should not be
feared from a man like me. Is it permissible to do that to anyone
except the one who turns away and disbelieve^?"^^

Based on that, fighting fellow Muslims is different from
fighting disbelievers and apostates in several ways:

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

283

1. The aim of fighting is to deter them. They should not be killed
deliberately, because the aim is to bring them back to obedience
and to stop their evil, not to kill them, whereas it is permissible to
deliberately kill the polytheists and apostates [in the case of
war1.9~

2. If slaves. women or children fight on the side of the
transgressors, they all come under the same ruling as free, adult
men. They are only being fought to protect against their harm, so
they are to be fought when they are attacking but left alone when
they are fleeing, whereas apostates and disbelievers may be
killed whether they are attacking or fleeing.99
3.

If the transgressors refrain from fighting - whether that
involves coming back to obedience, laying down their weapons,
being defeated, or becoming incapable because of injury,
sickness or being captured - it is not permissible to finish off
their wounded or kill the captives, whereas it is permissible to
kill wounded polytheists or apostates, and to execute prisoners.
Ibn Abi Shaybah narrated in his Mu~annafrom 'Ali that he said
on the day of the Camel: "Do not pursue anyone who is mnning
away or finish off anyone who is wounded. Whoever throws
down his weapon is safe."loOAccording to a report narrated by
'Abdur-Razzsq, 'Ali (&) insh-ucted his caller to call out on the
day of Basra: "Do not finish off anyone who is wounded, do not
pursue anyone who is fleeing, do not enter any house. Whoever
lays down his weapon is safe, and whoever locks his door is
safe." He also did not take any of their belonging^.'^' 'Alisaid
on the day of the Camel: "Do not pursue anyone who is rnnning
away, finish off anyone who is wounded, or kill any captive.
Stay away from the women even if they impugn your honour
and slander your leaders, for I remember that during the preIslamic time of ignorance, if a man hit a woman with a palm

284

'Ali's anitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

branch or a stick, he would he shamed because of that, he and his
descendants after him."'02 It was narrated that Abu U m h a h alB&hili (&) said: "I was present at Siffeen, and they did not
finish off anyone who was wounded, kill anyone who was
fleeing, or strip anyone who had been killed of his weapons." lo3
4.

The way in which captured transgressors are to be treated
depends on the circumstances. If it is certain that the prisoner
will not go back to fighting, then he is to be released. If there is
no such certainty, then he is to be detained until the war is over,
at which time he is released. It is not permissible to detain him
after that, whereas it is permissible to keep the disbeliever
caPtive.lo4

5.

When fighting other Muslims, it is not permissible to seek help
from the polytheists or from people of the Book living under
Muslim rule. When fighting apostates and hostile non-Muslims,
it is permissible to seek their help.lo5

6. A truce should not be made with Muslim opponents specifying a
fixed period of time, nor should a peace deal be made with rhem
in return for money. If a truce is made with them, it is not
binding, and if the Muslim leader is not able to fight them, he
should wait until he has the power to do so. If he makes a peace
deal with them in return for money, it is not valid; the money
should be examined and the source checked. If it came from their
z a k a and fay', it should not be returned, but it should be
distributed to those who are entitled to the zak& and fay'.
However, if it came from their own wealth, it is not permissible
to take possession of it; it must be returned to them.lo6'Ali (w
+)
did not regard the wealth of those who fought him in the Battle
of the Camel as permissible.
7.

If the Muslims rebel against the ruler on the basis of what may be
a valid reason, he should communicate with them. If they say

1
i

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

285

that they were wronged in any way, he should set things right. If
their argument is confused or false, he should explain to them;
when 'Ali (&) explained to the Kharijites what was wrong with
their argument, many of them came back to the ranks of the main
body of ~ u s l i m s . If
' ~they
~ recant, all well and good; otherwise
it is an obligation upon him and the Muslims to fight them.'''
8.

If the Muslim malcontents do not stop showing obedience to the
ruler, they do not gather together in a place where they stay
together away fiom everybody else, and they are just individuals
who can be easily controlled, then they are to be left alone and
not fought. They should be subject to just and fair mles with
regard to their rights and d u t i e ~ . ' ~

9.

Muslim transgressors should not he fought in ways that will
cause widespread ruin and destruction, such as using fire,
catapults that hurl heavy or burning objects, or other such
weapons. (Unless it is necessary to do that, such as when they
fortify themselves in a place and cannot be defeated otherwise.
In that case, it is permissible for the d e r to attack them with
catapults and fire, according to the view of ash-ShZa'i and Abn
~aneefah."') Their houses should not be burned, and their trees
should not be cut down, whereas all of that is permissible in the
case of fighting the disbelievers and polytheists.

10. It is not permissible to seize booty from their wealth or to take
their women and children captive, because the Prophet (g)
said:
"It is not permissible to take the wealth of a Muslim unless he
gives it willingly.""' It was narrated that 'Ali (&) said on the
day of the Camel: "Whoever recognises anything of this wealth
that belongs to him, let him take it.""'

This was one of the reasons why the Kharijites opposed him.
They said: "He fought and did not take his opponents'

286

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

womenfolk captive or take any booty. If they are disbelievers,
we should be allowed to take their womenfolk captive; if they
are believers, it is not permissible to take their womenfolk
captive or to fight them." Ibn 'Abbh (&) said to them in his
discussion with them: "With regard to your saying that he fought
and did not take the women captive or take any booty, would
you take your mother 'kisbah (%) captive and regard
(intimacy with) her as permissible
other woman, when
she is your mother? If you say, 'We regard (intimacy with) her as
permissible like any other woman,' then you have become
disbelievers, and if you say, 'She is not our mother,' you have
become disbeiievers." "3
Ibn Q u d b a h commented: "The reason for fighting the
transgressors is to keep them at bay and bring them back to the
truth, not because they are regarded as disbelievers. Nothing is
permissible with regard to them except what is necessary for self
defence, as in the case of an attacker or a bandit. The ruling on
his property and his womenfolk and children remains the same,
namely that they are protected in har ria.""^
From the reports narrated from 'Ali (&), it seems that it is
permissible to make use of their weapons. Ibn Abi Shaybah
narrated that Abu al-Bakhtari said: "When the people of the
Camel were defeated, 'Ali (&) said: 'Do not pursue anyone
who is leaving the battlefield, but whatever is left of mounts or
weapons, you can have it."'"5 According to another report, he
said: "Do not take anything of their property except what you
find in their camp."116

11. Whoeva among the transgressors is killed is to he washed and
shrouded, and the funeral prayer offered over them, because they
are Muslims, according to the opinion of ash-Shsa'i and ash%
a r - ~ ay."7
'

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

287

12. If the transgressors arenot innovators, then they arenot evildoers,
and the fighting of the ruler and the people of justice against
them is only because of their misinterpretation. Their case is
similar to that of scholars who try to derive rulings from texts.
According to the view of ash-Shsa'i, if one of them is of good
character, his testimony is to be accepted. As for the Kharijites
and innovators, if they rebel against the ruler, their testimony is
not to be accepted because they are considered e~ildoers."~

13. It is permissible for one who is on the side that is in the right to
kill his relative who is on the transgressing side, because killing
him is lawful and is like canying out a hadd punishment against
him; however, it is not permissible to seek to do that.Il9

14. If the transgressing group previously had control of the city, and
they collected land tax and zak& and carried out hadd
punishments, they should not be asked to pay back what they
collected when the group that is in the right regains control of
that city. When 'Ali (&) defeated the people of Basra after the
Battle of the Camel, he did not ask them for anything that they
had c01lected.l~~
15. The ruling on one who is in the right inheriting from one who is
in the wrong, and vice versa. A transgressor who killed a person
who was with the group that is in the right cannot inherit from
him and vice versa, because the Prophet 1%) said: "The killer
does not inherit."lZ1 Abu Haneefah's opinion was that: "One
who is in the right may inherit from a transgressor, but not the
other way round." Ahu Yoosuf said: "Each of them may inherit
from the other, because each is fighting for what he thinks is the
right cause."'22 This was also the view of an-~awawi."~
16. If the transgressors cannot be fought off except by killing them,
then it is permissible to kill them. In this case, there is no sin or
liability on those who kill them, nor is any expiation required of

288

'Ali'sattitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

them; they did what was enjoined upon them, and they killed for
the sake of Allah (B).hen fight ye [all] against the one that
transgresses until it complies with the command of Allah#
(Qur'an 49: 9). If a Muslim is attacked, and the only way he can
ward off the attacker or protect himself is by killing him, then it
is permissible for him to defend himself by killing the one who
wanted to kill him.
In the case of war, there is no liability for property of the
transgressors that is destroyed by those who are in right.lZ4By
the same token, the transgressors are not liable for lives or
property that they destroy in the case of war, according to the
more correct opinion, as an-Nawawi said.lz5Az-Zuhri narrated
that there was consensus among the Companions that the
transgressor was not liable if he killed one who was in the right.
He said: 'The first fitnah broke out when the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
were still alive, among whom were
those who had been at Badr. They were agreed that no one
should be subjected to retaliatory punishment, or have his wealth
confiscated, for actions he based on his own understanding of
~ u r ' a n . "lZ6 According to a report narrated by 'Abdw-Razziq,
the first turmoil broke out when many of the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
who had been present at Badr were still
alive. They were unanimously agreed that no hadd punishment
was to be carried out on anyone for taking female captives on the
basis of their own interpretation of the Qnr'an, no retaliatory
punishment was to be imposed for blood that they regarded as
permissible to shed on the basis of their own interpretation of the
Qur'an, and they were not to be required to return property that
they had regarded as permissible to take on the basis of their own
interpretation of the Qnr'an, unless it was something specific
whose owner was known, in which case it was to be returned to
its owner.lZ7

1.7. Most sigruhcant characteristics
of the Kharijites
The one who researches the history of the Kharijite sect will
note a number of distinctive characteristics of the followers of this
sect, including the following:

1.7.1. Going to extremes in religious issues
Undoubtedly the Kharijites were people of devotion and
worship. They were very enthusiastic about adhering to Islam by
applying its rulings and keeping away from everything that it forbids.
They also tried hard to completely avoid falling into any sin that is
contraq to Islam. That became a prominent feature of this group, and
no one could come anywhere close to them in this regard. There is
nothing more indicative of that than the words of the Messenger of
Allah (g):
"They will recite Qur'an, and your recitation will be as
nothing in comparison to theirs; your fasting will be as nothing in
comparison to theirs."128 Ibn 'Abhh (&) said, describing them
when he entered upon them to discuss with them: "I entered upon
people, and I have never seen anyone strive harder in worship than
them. Their foreheads bore marks because of prostration, their hands
were like the knees of camels, they wore washed shirts and strove
hard, and their faces were pale and wan from spending their nights in
prayer."lZ9It was narrated that Junduh al-Azdi said: 'We went to the
camp of the Kharijites when we were with 'Ali ibn Ahi Tiilib, and we
heard them humming like bees, because of their reciting Qur'an."130
They were people who fasted, prayed and read Qur'an a great
deal, but they overstepped the mark of moderation and went to
extremes. They became overly strict, to the extent that this strictness
made them go against the principles of Islam by following what their
reasoning suggested to them, such as the idea that the one who

290

'Ali's attitude towards the Khnrijites and Shia

commits a major sin is to be regarded as a disbeliever. (We will
discuss their beliefs and ideas below.) Some of them went to such
extremes in that regard that they applied this opinion to one who
commits any sin, even a minor sin, they regarded him as a disbeliever
and polytheist who was doomed to spend eternity in bell."' As a
result of this strictness, which took them beyond the boundaries of
Islam and its sublime goals, they accused every Muslim who disagreed
with them of being a disbeliever or a hypocrite. They even regarded it
as permissible to shed the blood of those who disagreed
with them.13'
Some of them, such as the Azzqah, regarded it as permissible to kill
the women and children of those who differed with t h e ~ n . ' ~ '
Undoubtedly because of their ignorance, strictness and
harshness, the Kharijites distorted the beauties of Islam in a very
strange way. This going to extremes, using far-fetched
interpretations, took them away from the spirit of Islam and its
beauty and moderation. In their extreme ways, they followed a path
that was never preached by Muhammad (g)
or encouraged in the
noble Qur'an. The piety that they showed outwardly was like a kind
of blind piety; their outward righteousness was in fact superficial.
Their interpretation of Islam was artificially attractive. They hoped
for paradise and wanted to strive for it by means of strictness,
extremism and exaggeration, in a way that put them beyond the
boundary of what is right.'34 The Prophet (g)
warned against going
to extremes or being overly strict with regard to religious matters,
because it is contrary to the moderate and easy nature of Islam, and he
told us that the one who goes to extremes is deserving of doom and
loss. It is narrated in a sound report that he (g)
said: "Those who go
to extremes are doomed,"135 and he said it three times. Thus the
oddness of the Kharijites becomes clear. The Prophet (g)
said:
"Religion is very easy. Whoever overburdens himself in religion will
be defeated, so try your best to do what is right. If you cannot attain
perfection, then strive to do that which will bring you close to it."136

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

1.7.2. Ignorance of religion
Among the greatest problems of the Kharijites are ignorance of
the Qur'an and Sunnah, poor understanding, lack of contemplation,
lack of reasoning and failure to apply the texts to the right situation.
Ibn 'Umar (&) thought they were the worst of Allah's creation, and
he said: "They picked out verses that were revealed concerning the
disbelievers, and they applied them to the believer^."'^^ If he was
asked about the Harooriyyah, he would say: "They regard Muslims
as disbelievers and regard their blood and their wealth as permissible,
they marry women during their 'iddahs, and if a woman comes to
them, one of them will marry her although she has a husband. I do not
know of anyone who is more deserving of being fought than
them."13s
Due to their ignorance of the laws of Allah (B),
they thought
that arbitration was a sin that implied disbelief, meaning that the one
who became involved in that should admit that he was a disbeliever
for doing so and then repent.139 This is what they demanded from
'Ali (&); they wanted him to confess that he was a disbeliever and
then repent. The Kharijites' thinking of him, and the Mnhijireen and
An& with him, as being wrong, while regarding themselves as
having more knowledge and understanding than them, is indeed the
essence of ignorance and misguidance.140
One of the signs of their extreme ignorance may he seen in the
incident where they came across Abdullah ibn Khabbib (&), who
was withhis pregnant slave woman. They discussed some issues
with him, then they asked him about his opinion of 'Uthmik (&)
and 'Ali (&), and he spoke highly of them. They got angry with him
and threatened to kill him in the worst manner; they killed him and
slit open the woman's belly.L41A pig belonging to the non-Muslims
passed by them, and one of them killed it. They thought that this was
not appropriate, so they looked for the owner of the pig and gave him

292

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites a d Shia

compensation for his pig. How strange it is that a pig would have
greater sanctity than a Muslim, in the eyes of someone who claimed
to belong to ~ s l a r n .Such
' ~ ~ is the devotion of the ignorant, which was
dictated to them by whims and desires and by ata an.'^^
Ibn Hajar said: "When the Kharijites ruled that those who
differed with them were disbelievers, they regarded it as permissible
to shed their blood, but they kept away from the people of the Book
who were under Muslim protection, saying: 'We have to adhere to
the covenant with them.' They refrained from fighting the polytheists
and focused on fighting the Muslims. All of that was the result of
ignorant devotion on the part of people whose hearts were not
illuminated by the light of knowledge and who did not have a strong,
solid base of knowledge to protect them. It is sufficient for them that
their leader rejected what the Messenger of Allah (g)
said and
accused him of being unfair. We ask Allah to keep us safe and
sound."144 Ibn Taymiyah said concerning them: "They are ignorant,
and they departed from the way of Ah1 asSunnah wal-Jami'ah
because of i g n ~ r a n c e . " ' ~ ~
Thus it is clear that ignorance was one of the most prominent
characteristics of that group, which was one of the groups that are
attributed to Islam. Ignorance is a serious sichess, which causes
doom in such a way that the individual does not realise it; in fact, he
may intend to do good hut fall into the opposite.146

1.7.3.Rebelling against authority
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "Due to
their misguidance, these people believed that the leaders of guidance
and the main group of Muslims were unjust and misguided. This is
the view of those who drifted away from the Sunnah, such as the
Rififidis and their ilk. They regarded what they saw of oppression and
injustice as disbelief; then they based the rulings of their own

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

293

innovation on that."147 Therefore they rebelled against authority and
strove to create division among the Muslims.
This is explained by their attitude towards Arnir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&); at the most critical time, they let him down, opposed him
and rebelled against him.I4' That has remained one of their
characteristics throughout history. If anyone disagrees with them
conceming any issue, they label him as an enemy and cast him aside,
to the point where they divide into many groups, each group
regarding the others as disbelievers. Hence there has been a great deal
of fighting, division and rebellion among them.149

1.7.4. Denouncing people as disbelievers because
of sin, and regarding the blood and wealth
of the Muslims as permissible
Ibn Taymiyab said: "The other difference of the Kharijites and
followers of innovation is that they regard people as disbelievers
because of sin and bad deeds; as a consequence of that, they regard
the blood and wealth of the Muslims as permissible, believing that
the Muslim lands are the lands of war and that their own land is the
land of faith. The majority of RZdis say the same. This is the root of
innovation, which is proven by the Sunnah of the Messenger (g)
and
the consensus of the early generation to be innovation; what is
permissible is regarded as a sin, and sin is regarded as disbelief."'50
The Kharijites were distinguished by their particular views and
opinions, through which they parted ways with the main body of the
Muslims and regarded their views as part of the only religion that is
acceptable to Allah
In their view, those who disagreed with
them conceming that had gone beyond the bounds of Islam, so they
must be disavowed. Indeed, some of them went to extremes in that
regard and thought it obligatory to fight those who differed with
them; they regarded it as permissible to shed their blood.'51

(s).

294

'Ali's attitude towards the Khariiites and Shia

For example, they killed Abdullah ibn KhabbSb for no other
reason than that he did not agree with their opinion.152Ibn Katheer
said: 'They started to kill women and children, slitting open the
bellies of pregnant women and doing things that no one else did."'53
Ibn Taymiyah said: "The first innovation, such as that of the
Kharijites, came about because of their poor understanding of the
Qur'an. They did not intend to go against it, but they understood from
it something that was not indicated by it. Therefore they thought that
those who commit sin are to be regarded as disbelievers, because the
believer is the one who is righteous and pious. They said: 'The one
who is not righteous and pious is a disbeliever who will abide in hell
forever.' Then they said: "Uthmin and 'Ali and those who supported
them and loved them are not believers, because they judged by
something other than that which Allah has revealed.' Thus their
innovation was based on two ideas: that the one who goes against the
Qur'an in his actions or mistaken opinion is a disbeliever, and that
this notion applied to 'Uthrnin and 'Ali(may AUah be pleased with
them) and those who supported them. Hence it is essential to avoid
labelling believers as disbelievers because of their sins and mistakes.
This was the first innovation that appeared in Islam, and those who
followed it denounced the Muslims as disbelievers and regarded their
blood and wealth as permissible. There are sound, proven hadiths
from the Prophet
that criticise them (these innovators) and
enjoin fighting them."154

a)

1.7.5. Believing it to be possible for the Prophet (g)
to do something that is not appropriate
for him to do, such as being unjust
Ibu Taymiyah said: "The Kharijites regarded it as possible for
himself to be unjust and for his Sunnah to be
the Messenger (g)
misguided, and they did not regard it as obligatoly to obey and follow
him. Instead, they believed in what he conveyed of the Qur'an but not

'Ali ibn Abi Ta^lib

295

what he prescribed of the Sunnah that - according- to their claim contradicted the apparent meaning of the Qur'an. The majority of the
innovators and Khariiites followed them in that regard.
If they think
that the Messenger said something that differs from their views, they
will not follow him; rather they try to avoid the evidence, either by
rejecting the chain of transmission or by misinterpreting the report
itself; sometimes they criticise the chain of narrators and sometimes
they criticise the text. Therefore they are neither following nor
adhering to the hue Sunnah, which was brought by the Messenger
(B);in fact, they are not even following the ~ u r ' a n . " ' ~ ~

1.7.6. Criticising and regarding others as misguided
One of the most prominent characteristics of the Kharijites is
their criticising the imams of guidance and regarding 'them as
misguided, unjust and mistaken. This characteristic is embodied in
the attitude of Dhul-Khuwaysirah towards the Messenger of
guidance (g)
when be told him: "0 Messenger of Allah, be just."lS6
Dhul-Khuwaysirah regarded himself as more pious than the
Messenger of Allah (g),
and he judged the Messenger of Allah (g)
to be unjust and unfair in dividing the spoils. This characteristic has
been constant throughout their history and has had the worst effect,
because so many meanings and actions were based on it.'"

1.7.7. Thinking in negative terms
This attribute of the Kbarijites was embodied in DhulKhuway~irah'signorant verdict regarding the Messenger of guidance
(g)
as lacking in sincerity, when he said: "By Allah, this is a division
in which there is no fairness and which was not intended for the sake
of ~ l l a h . " ' ' ~When Dhul-Khuwaysrah saw that the Messenger of
Allah
had given to the rich leaders and not to the poor, he did not
interpret this conduct in a good way. This was strange, especially

(s,)

296

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

when there were many reasons to interpret this action in a positive
way. Even if there were no other reason but that the one who did it
was the Messenger of guidance (g),
that would have been sufficient
reason to think positively of it. Dhul-Khuwaysirah refused to do so
and had negative thoughts because of his psychological problem,
then he tried to conceal this problem by pretending to call for justice.
Hence Satan laughed at him and tricked him, making him fall into his
trap. Man should watch himself and examine his motives and aims.
He should beware of his whims and desires and be alert to the tricks
of Satan, who often makes bad deeds appear attractive by adorning
them with a bright cover, and justifies abhorrent behavionr on the
basis of adhering to principles of truth. One of the means of
protecting oneself against the tricks and traps of Satan is knowledge.
If Dhnl-Khuwaysirah had had the slightest trace of knowledge or
understanding, he would not have made this mistake.'59

1.7.8. Harshness towards the Muslims
The Kharijites are known for their harshness and roughness.
They were very harsh and violent towards the Muslims, and this
reached terrible levels. They regarded the blood, honour and wealth
of the Muslims as permissible, and they terrorised them and killed
them. As for the enemies of Islam, such as idol worshippers and
others, they left them alone, maintaining peace with them and not
bothering them. Histow has recorded dark pages for the Kharijites in
this regard.l6' The story of Abdullah ibn Khabbib and his murder
has not yet been forgotten.
While the Kharijite attitude towards the Muslims was
accompanied by harshness, cnrelty and violence, they were gentle,
peaceful and kind with the disbeliever^.'^^ The Lawgiver describes
Sharia as easygoing and tolerant; it recommends strictness towards
the disbelievers and kindness towards the believers, but the Kharijites

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

297

did the opposite.162 Allah says: (Muhammad is the Messenger of
Allah. And those who are with him are severe against disbelievers,
and merciful among themselves,) (Qur'an 48: 29) and, 4 0 you who
believe! Whoever from among you turns hack from his religion
[Islam], Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will
love Him; humble towards the believers, stem towards the
disbelievers, fighting in the way of Allah, and never afraid of the
blame of the blamers) (Qur'un 5: 54). The Kharijites did the opposite
of what is mentioned in these verses; they terrorised the M n ~ 1 i r n s . l ~ ~
These are some of the characteristics for which the Kharijites are well
known.
The most important manifestations of
extremism in modem times
The manifestations of extremism in modem times are many
and include the following:
1.7.8.i. Being overly strict with oneself in religious
commitment and making things difficult for others
The phenomenon of extremism in modem times is a drifting
away from the path of moderation in religious commitment, which
He wamed us against that in the
was the way of the Prophet (g).
hadith which was narrated by ~ b Hurayrah
n
(&). The Messenger of
Allah
said: "Religion is very easy. Whoever overburdens
himself in religion will he defeated, so try your best to do what is
right. If yon cannot attain perfection, then strive to do that which will
bring you close to it.73164

(s)

Extremism in religion often stems from a lack of
understanding of the faith. These are among the most prominent
characteristics of the Kharijites, namely extremism in religious
commitment and lack of proper understanding. Most of those who
have some inclination towards the ideas of the Kharijites today are

298

'Ali's attitude towards the Khariiites andShia

people in whom these two characteristics may be found.165One of
the manifestations of extremism is making things difficult instead of
making them easy. Extremists require people to do things that they
are not able to do, or oblige them to do things that they are not
required to do according to Islam, which is of an easy nature. They do
not pay attention to the variations in people's abilities and level of
understanding, so they address them concerning concepts that they
do not understand and demand of them things that they cannot do.
One of the causes of harshness is a conupt kind of piety,
ignorance of the prioritising of rnlings and a failure to understand that
not all people are on the same level. Some of the manifestations of
making things difficult are: obliging everyone to refer to Sharia texts
and derive rnlings, talking to people about things that they cannot
comprehend, ignoring concessions granted in Sharia, and making
obligatory things that are not obligatory according to sharia.I6"

1.7.8.ii. Arrogance and looking down on people,
and what that leads to of young people
taking positions of leadership
One of the prominent features of the phenomenon of
extremism in modem times is arrogance and looking down on others,
as well as claiming to have knowledge when one of them does not
even know the basic principles and simplest rnlings of Islam. One
may have a little knowledge, without any proper understanding of the
fundamentals, but he thinks that he has acquired the knowledge of the
earlier and later generations. In his arrogance, he may even think that
the scholars have little knowledge, and he gives up seeking
knowledge. Thus he will he doomed because of his arrogance, and he
will cause others to be doomed. This is how the early Kharijites were;
they claimed to he scholars and people of howledge. They insulted
the scholars, when in reality, it was they who were among the most
ignorant of people.167

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

299

This pretence of knowledge and this arrogance leads to young
and foolish people trying to become prominent in calling to Islam
without knowledge or proper understanding. Although they are
ignorant, some people take them as leaders. They issue fatwas
without knowledge and judge matters without understanding; they
confront major events without any experience or wisdom and without
referring to the people who have the knowledge, understanding,
experience and wisdom. Indeed, many of them look down on the
scholars and shaykhs and do not appreciate their status. If one of the
shaykhs issues a fatwa that does not appeal to their whims and
desires, or is not in harmony with their way of thinking or attitude,
they will start accusing him of a lack of knowledge, cowardice,
hypocrisy, naivet6, lack of awareness and other shortcomings.
Spreading these nunours causes division, conuption, resentment
against the scholars and undermining of their value and status. This
causes a great deal of harm to the Muslims in both religious and
worldly terms.16'

1.7.8.iii. Persisting in one's opinion and
regarding others as ignorant
One of the most prominent features of extremism in modem
times is fanatical adherence to one's opinion without acknowledging
the validity of other opinions, and rejecting any truth they have as
long as it is different from one's own view. Among the causes that
generate fanatical adherence to one's own opinion ax lack of
knowledge, lack of awareness of any other view, admiring one's own
stance and following whims and desires.
The problem of admiring one's own view and being fanatical
in adhering to it was the cause of doom in the past. For example, what
caused the doom of the ignorant Dhul-Khuway~irah?Ibn alJawzi
says: "His problem was that he was pleased with his own opinion.

300

'Ali's attitude towards the Khurijites and Shia

Had he thought a little, he would have realised that no view is
What caused the
superior to that of the Messenger of Allah (@)."'69
doom of the followers of ~hul-Khuwaysirahwas their admiration of
their own opinions and their thinking badly of others. The Kharijites
were devoted in worship, but they believed that they were more
knowledgeable than 'Ah(&), and this was a serious problem'70 that
caused their doom. These wretches fell prey to some phrases which
they did not understand well, and they would not listen to anyone
who could explain them and help them to understand them, because
they thought that they were right and everyone else was wrong.
Muhammad Abu Zabrah says: 'They were obsessed with some
slogans such as 'faith', 'there is no ling except the ruling of Allah',
and 'disavowing the wrongdoers'. In the name of these slogans, they
regarded it as permissible to shed Muslim blood and spread killing
throughout the Muslim lands, attacking e~erywhere."'~'This hateful
fanaticism prevented them from responding to the truth after it
became clear. Amir al-Mu'mnineen 'ALi (&) debated with them, and
Ibn 'Abbis (&) debated with them, and they left no excuse for them.
They rebutted their flawed arguments, established clear proof against
them and refuted them with decisive arguments, but only a few of
them responded; most of them rushed to shed the blood of the
Muslims. Adhering fanatically to one's point of view and regarding
others as ignorant is contrary to important Islamic principles such as
consultation and offering sincere advice.

1.7.8.i~.Criticising the righteous scholars
The current era is witness to a strange campaign and weird
phenomenon, namely a kind of aggression that is aimed at
undermining the position of devoted scholars by criticising them and
accusing them of being misguided and confused. Newspapers,
magazines, books, articles, classrooms and study circles have seen
many examples of this campaign, which has caused a great deal of

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

301

harm to the Muslim Ummah by creating and deepening division.
Undoubtedly there are reasons for criticising and undermining the
scholars, such as: leaming without a teacher, misunderstanding some
statements of the scholars, following whims and desires, and envy.
Some young people have resorted to bad conduct, namely
seeking
- out the faults and mistakes of the scholars, looking for some
odd views they may have, and misinterpreting their words in a way
that is different from what was intended. They did that to justify their
senseless campaign, the aim of which is to undermine scholars, both
classical and contemporary, whose views differ from theirs and who
do not approve of their way of thinking, which is not the way of
moderation. This action of theirs has caused a great deal of harm to
Islam and a great deal of joy to the enemies of Islam, such as the
Zionists and idol worshippers.
This shameful attitude, which is indicative of ignorance,
sickness and resentment, is something that the scholars have warned
against because of the danger it poses to the Muslims and because it
is carrying out the plans of the enemies of Islam and achieving their
goals for them, without any effort on their part.172
Ibn Taymiyah said, forbidding the narration of weak views
from imams and scholars: "No one should narrate such weak
opinions from any of the imams of the Muslims, whether by way of
condemning him or by way of following him in this view. That is a
kind of undermining of the imams and seeking to follow weak views.
By following this method, the ruling official of the Tatars created
turmoil among the Sunnis, so that he could lead them to leave Ah1 asSunnah wal-Jam2ah altogether and make them follow the way of the
RZfidis and heretic^.""^
Those who challenge the devoted scholars of the Ummah are
serving the interests of the Jews, Christians, tyrants and intelligence

302

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shia

agencies, whether they realise it or not. Those who are still criticising
the scholars of the Ummah in this way have drifted away from the
path of Ah1 as-Sunnah watJam2'ah, who say: 'The scholars of the
earliest generation, and the Tibi'oon who came after them, are
people of righteousness and good conduct, people of deep
knowledge and understanding, who should not be referred to except
in the best way. Whoever mentions them in a bad way is not
following the way of Ahl as-Sunnah w a l - ~ a m 2 a h . " ' ~ ~
Those who criticise the devoted scholars of the Ummah should
realise that backbiting about the scholars is a very serious sin, and the
way in which Allah exposes those who undermine them is well
known. This one who pretends to be a scholar does not realise that
what matters when judging people is the numerous virtues and good
deeds they have to their credit. Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have
mercy on him) said: "The one who has knowledge of Islam and
experience of life will know for certain that the prominent man who
bas served Islam and done righteous deeds, who holds a prominent
position in Islam and among the people of Islam, may slip and make
mistakes, but he may be excused for his mistake; indeed, he may be
rewarded for his efforts to make the right decision. Therefore, it is not
permissible to follow him in that mistake; at the same time, it is not
permissible to weaken his position and status in the hearts of the
Muslims."
Who would be left for the Ummah of Islam if its scholars were
undermined? It would be left with young people who cannot recite
Qur'an well, do not understand Arabic, and do not have much
knowledge about many branches of Islamic knowledge. This attitude
of criticising the scholars fills the hearts of the enemies of Islam with
joy, because it creates a generation without leaders. Have you ever
seen a generation without leaders succeed?

I

'Aliibn Abi Trilib

303

The worst of people in previous nations were their scholars
and rabbis, many of whom went astray and led others astray. Allah
(g)says: 60 yon who believe! Verily, there are many of the
[Jewish] rabbis and the [Christian] monks who devour the wealth of
mankind in falsehood, and hinder [them] from the way of Allah [i.e.
Allah's religion of Islamic Monotheismlb (Qur'an 9: 34).
The best of the Muslims are their devoted, active scholars.
Ash-Shu'bi said: "In every nation, their scholars are the worst except for the Muslims, whose scholars are the best of them." 176 Ibn
Taymiyah explained it this way: "Every nation apart from the
Muslims is astray, and the ones who led them astray are their
scholars, so their scholars are the worst of them. But the Muslims are
following true guidance, and guidance is explained to the people by
their scholars, so their scholars are the best of them."'77

1.7.8.v. Thinking negatively
This problem is very widespread and is causing a great deal of
harm at the present time. This disease may be fatal and a means of
destruction and ruin; it may lead to serious consequences and a great
deal of evil and conuption. There are causes for this disease such as
ignorance, which means not being able to understand the reality of
what one sees, hears and reads and the aim behind it, or not being
able to understand the subtle rulings of Sharia with regard to some
issues, especially if those issues are strange and require subtle
understanding and farsightedness. This ignorance makes a person
hasten to be suspicious, think negatively and undermine the position
of a particular scholar.
Another cause of this problem is whims and desires, which is
the worst of diseases. In this case, seeing or hearing something that
one does not like, agree with or want is sufficient to make a person's
suspicions run wild. He avoids weighing matters according to a
precise Sharia standard, trying to find excuses, or pausing to ponder

304

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites andShia

and re-examine the issue, let alone look critically at his own
understanding. Whims and desires prevent all of that.
Another cause is self-admiration and arrogance, which means
thinking highly of oneself and feeling proud of one's own
understanding (if one has any understanding). This self-admiration
prompts one to praise himself and look down on others. In his
estimation, he is right and everyone else is wrong; he is guided and
everyone else is misguided.
We have seen some people whose suspicion and negative
thinking has reached a very peculiar level, leading them to exclude all
other people, living and dead, and to accuse them of being deviant
and misguided, guilty of following compt beliefs. According to this
view, everyone else has a problem with his beliefs; these people
alone are sincere. Everyone else is doomed, hut they are saved. This
negative thinking is a disease, and every disease has serious effects.
Bad only leads to bad, and among its bad effects are the following:
'*

It prompts a person to seek out faults and look for
mistakes. By doing so, he exposes himself to the wrath and
punishment of Allah, because the Messenger of Allah (&)
warned people in whose hearts there is this sickness: "0
you who have believed with your tongues but faith bas not
entered your hearts, do not backbite the Muslims or seek
out their faults, for the one who seeks out their faults,
Allah will seek out his faults. When AUah seeks out a
person's faults, He will expose him even if he is in his
house."178

*:*

It prompts a person to backbite and slander the honour of
others, and instils a vengeful attitude.

*'

Finally, negative thinking sows division among the
Muslims, breaks the bonds of brotherhood, severs the ties
of love and creates enmity, hatred and resentment.

'Ali ibn Abi Talib

305

It is quite clear that this disease is very serious, so Islam's
attitude towards it is decisive. It calls for and enjoins avoiding most
suspicion, because real-life events prove that being controlled by
suspicion and following what it dictates leads to adverse
consequences and a great deal of ham.179 Allah (%) says: $0you
who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are
sins) (Qur'an 49: 12).
Ibn Katheer said: "Here AUah (&) is forbidding His believing
slaves to engage in much suspicion, which means making
accusations and believing that one's family, relatives and other
people are betraying you when there is no cause to do so, because that
may be pure sin. So a lot of suspicion is to be avoided as a
precautionary measure."180
One of the ways of averting suspicion or negative thinking is
by seeking excuses for your brother. 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b (&) said:
"Do not think anything but good about the word spoken by your
believing brother when there is a way to interpret it in a good
manner."181
1.7.8.vi. Being harsh and cruel with others
One of the manifestations of extremism in modem times is
harshness and cruelty in dealing with others, when being harsh is not
appropriate. It is as if the basic principle when dealing with others is
to be cruel and harsh, not gentle and merciful. This harshness is the
usual feature of some young people, whose violence and cmelty may
go beyond words to actions, so that innocent blood is shared and
buildings are destroyed because of it. This violence may cause a great
deal of harm to its perpetrators and to the U d . There are a
number of main reasons why some young people use violence,
harshness and cmelty, which we may sum up as follows:
- Going through hard times. Many of these young people

306

'Ali'sanitlrde towards the Kharijites and Shia

have been subjected to various trials that have had an
impact on their psyches, hence there is an extreme
reaction. They responded to violence with violence, which
then became second nature to them.
- Ignorance of the rnles connected to enjoining what is good

and forbidding what is evil. Enjoining what is good and
forbidding what is evil make up one of the most important
duties that Allah (&) has made obligatory upon this
Ummah. However, the one who does it should be
knowledgeable about it, so that he can achieve the interests
and avoid making matters worse. It should be done in the
gentlest and most straightforward way, and there are
matters that should be understood and known by the one
who wants to cany out this duty. For example, one must
know that this duty may be fulfilled sometimes in the heart
(by feeling discontent with the evil or hating it); it may be
fulfilled sometimes on the tongue (by speaking out and
giving advice); and it may be fulfilled sometimes by taking
action (by physically removing evil). Fulfilling it in the
heart is obligatory in every case, but some people make a
mistake here; they want to enjoin good and forbid evil
either verbally or physically in all cases, without any
understanding, forbearance or patience, and without
looking at what is and is not more appropriate to the
situation and what is or is not achievable. So they enjoin
what is good and forbid what is evil, believing that they are
obeying Allah ( B )and His Messenger (g),
when in fact
they are violating the prescribed limits.182
- It is essential to have knowledge of what is good and what

is evil, and to know how to distinguish between them. It is
also essential to have knowledge of the people being

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

307

addressed. Part of righteousness and proper conduct is to
enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil in accordance
with the straight path, which is the shortest path that leads
to the desired results in the most straightforward manner. It
is essential to be gentle
and kind and it is also essential to
.
be forbearing and patient in putting up with the inevitable
inconvenience and discomfort; otherwise, the person will
cause more harm than good. So the three essential things
are knowledge, kindness and patience: knowledge before
enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil,
kindness when doing it and patience afterwards. He must
have all three with him when enjoining what is good or
forbidding what is evil. Al-QkJi Abu Ya'la said: "No one
should enjoin what is good or forbid what is evil except
one who has proper understanding of what he is enjoining
and
Being ignorant of these issues and not
paying attention to them will lead to strictness and
violence in calling people to Islam.
- Some young people use harsh and cruel methods when

trying to guide people, debate with them and call them to
give up what is contrruy to Sharia. They think that being
harsh will give results and deter people, but they forget that
being kind and gentle is the original principle that is not to
be forsaken until after all gentle and kind means have been
exhausted. Gentleness is what yields good results and has
an impact on people's hearts; harshness, on the other hand,
puts people off in most cases and makes the transgressor
persist in his ways. It is very strange that these people did
not differentiatebetween the one who transgresses the limit
knowingly and the one who does so unknowingly; between
the one who promotes innovation and the duped,
misguided victim; and between mistakes concerning which

308

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shia

there is a difference of scholarly opinion and mistakes on
which there is consensus that they are wrong.
One of the causes of the harshness adopted by some of these
people is roughness in dealing with their parents; they do
not show them any respect or help them or serve them.
These people forget thatparents have a special status ur~like
other people, especially when it comes to calling and
guiding them. That does not mean that one should
compromise on religious commitment or adherence to any
issue of Islam, or that one should commit sins in order to
please their whims and desires - far from it. We are
referring instead to good manners when dealing with them,
such as being gentle in speech, being kind and patient with
them and showing them compassion and mercy. Allah says:
#And We have enjoined on man [to be dutiful and good] to
his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship
upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two
years -give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is
the final destination. But if they [both] strive with you to
make you join in worship with Me others that of which
you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave
with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him
who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Thcn to
Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used
to do.) (Qur'an 31: 14-15)
We have seen some young people refraining from helping
people who mix good deeds with bad; in their view, these people are
not deserving of any service, kind words or help. These young people
do not have a clear idea of the concept of love and hate for the sake of
Allah (&) and the limits of each of them. For them, hating the had
deeds takes precedence over loving the good deeds. They forget that

'Ali ibn Abi TEZib

309

providing social services is one of the most successful means of
calling people to Islam, because it is a practical means that has a
greater impact on people than mere words. They forget that their
harsh treatment and refraining from helping deepens the gap between
them and people and causes people to go and join the ranks of the
deviants who are the enemies of Islam.
Another example of this extreme violence is what some of the
people do, going beyond harshness of speech to killing and shedding
blood -the blood of scholars, innocent soldiers or innocent civilians.
Finally, it comes as no surprise to learn that these people of violence
often turn against each other and attack one another, sometimes
verbally and sometimes physically. This will come as no surprise if
you study a little of the history of these groups which have abandoned
the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger (g)
and the
methodology of the righteous predecessors. These groups opposed
one another and regarded one another as misguided disbelievers.
This is the fate of those who abandoned the methodology
brought by the Seal of the Prophets (B).
Islam's stance on violence
and harshness when calling to Islam and interacting with people is
very clear. Allah
says, enjoining Moosa and his brother Haroon:
(Go, both of you, to Fi'aun [Pharaoh], verily, he has transgressed
[all bounds in disbelief and disobedience and behaved as an arrogant
and as a tyrant]. And speak to him mildly; perhaps he may accept
admonition or fear [Allah].B (Qur'an 20: 43-44)

(s)

These were the instructions of our Lord (s)to Moosa and
Haroon (,=)when calling the tyrant Pharaoh: to speak mildly or
gently when explaining the truth because it is more beneficial and
more likely to be accepted and to instil fear of Allah (&). Allah ( B )
says: (The good deed and the evil deed cannot be equal. Repel [the
evil] with one which is better [i.e. Allah orders the faithful believers
to be patient at the time of anger, and to excuse those who treat them

31 0

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shia

badly] then verily he, between whom and you there was enmity, [will
become] as though he was a close friend. But none is granted it [the
above quality] except those who are patient -and none is granted it
except the owner of the great portion [of happiness in the hereafter,
i.e., paradise and of a high moral character] in this world.) (Qur'an
41: 34-35)

The caller to Islam will inevitably encounter things that upset
and anger him in his wwk, so it is essential for him to train himself to
he patient and to protect himself by suppressing his anger and
pardoning people. 4 0 my son! Aqim-ij-Saliih [perform as-Salih],
enjoin [on people] Al-Ma 'roof [Islamic Monotheism and all that is
good], and forbid [people] from Al-Munkar [i.e. disbelief in the
Oneness of Allah, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad],
and bear with patience whatever befalls you. Verily, these are some
of the important commandments [ordered by Allah with no
e~em~tion1.b
(Qur'an 31: 17)
The caller to Islam should avoid things that provoke and annoy
people and should avoid reviling and impugning others: dAnd insult
not those whom they [disbelievers] worship besides Allah, lest they
insult AUah wrongfully without knowledge.)) (Qur'an 6: 108)
There are many texts from the Prophet (&) which confirm this
and focus on adhering to the principle of kindness and avoiding
harshness and violence. He (g)
said: "There is never any kindness in
a thing but it beautifies it, and kindness is never absent from a thing
but it makes it
Kindness is the basic principle in calling people to Islam. That
does not mean cancelling out strictness altogether - not at all.
Strictness does have its place, after all means of kindness and
patience have been exhausted. The guided one is the one whom Allah
(&) guides to differentiate among different situations and whom He
protects from whims and desire^."^

and Shiite thought
2.1. The meaning of the words
'Shia' and 'Raft in the Arabic language
and in Sharia terminology
2.1.1. The meaning of the word 'Shia' in Arabic
In Arabic, a man's shia refers to his followers and supporters.
The phrase tashayya'a ar-rajulu means 'the man claimed to believe
in Shiism'. The phrase tashiiyya'a al-quwm means 'the people
divided into different groups'. Any group of people who are united
and follow one another's opinions may be described as shay '. Allah
(&) says: {As was done in the past with the people of their kind
[ashyci'ihim]) (Qur'an 34: 54), referring to people like them among
the past nations.ls6 In al-Mi~brihal-Muneer, it says: "(The word)
Shia refers to followers and supporters. Any group of people who
unite on an issue are a 'shia' (party). Then the word Shia began to be
used to describe a specific g ~ o u ~ . So
" ' in
~ linguistic
~
terms, the word
Shia refers to people, companions, followers and helpers. This
meaning is used in some verses of the noble Qur'an, such as the
following two verses:
{And he [Moosa] found there two men fighting, - one of his party
[shi'atihi] b s religion - from the Children of Israel], and the other
of his foes. The man of his [own] party asked him for help against his
foe.),
(Qur'an 28: 15)
(And, verily, among those who followed his mooh's (Noah's)] way
[shi'atihi] [Islamic Monotheism] was Ibribeem [Abraham].)
(Qur'an 37: 83)

312

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijite.~and Shin

In the fxst verse, the word Shia refers to people; in the second
verse it refers to the followers who agree with a view or method and
take part in it.

2.1.2. The meaning of the word 'Shia'
in Islamic terminology
The definition of the word 'Shia' is connected to different
stages of their development and the development of their ideology or
belief. It should be noted that the beliefs and ideas of the Shia are
constantly developing and changing; Shiism during the early period
was not like the Shiism that appeared later on. In the early period, no
one was called a Shia except one who preferred 'Ali to ' ~ t h m k . ' ~ ~
The words 'Shia' and ' 'Uthmini' were used, with a Shia being one
who preferred 'Ali over 'Uthmk. On this basis, the definition of the
Shia in the earliest period is that they were those who preferred 'Ali
to 'Uthmk only.189Ibn Taymiyah said: "The early Shia were those
who, at the time of 'Ali (&), believed in the superiority of Abn Bakr
and mar."'^^ Shurayk ibn Abdullah, who was one of those who
were described as being Shia, disagreed with giving the name of
Shiism to those who preferred 'Ali over Ahu Bakr and 'Umar,
because this was contrary to the mntawitir repolts from 'Ali which
stated the superiority of Abu Bakr and 'Umar.
Tashayyu' (Shiism) means supporting and following, not
opposing and differing.19' Ibn Batah narrated that his shaykh, who
was known as Abu al-'Abbis ihn Masrooq, said: "Muhammad ibn
Hnmayd told us, Jareer told us, from Sufyh, that Abdullah ibn Ziyid
ibn Jareer said: Abu Ishiq as-Subay'i came to Kufah, and Shahr ibn
'Atiyyah said: 'Let us go and see him.' They spoke, and Ahu Ishiq
said: 'I left Kufah when no one doubted the superiority and
precedence of Abu Bakr and 'Umar. Now I have c o ~ n e , ' ~ ~ athey
n d are
saying- by Allah, I do not know what they are saying.'" Mnhihb ad-

i

'Aliibn Abi Ttlib

313

Deen al-Khateeb said: 'This is an impostant historical text that
highlights the development of Shiism. Abu IshQ as-Subay'i was the
shaykh and scholar of ~ u f a h . He
' ~ ~was born during the caliphate of
three years before he was
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Uthmh . ..
martyred, and he lived a long life, until he died in 127 AH. He was a
child during the caliphate of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), and he
said of himself: 'My father lifted me up so that I could see 'Ali ibn Abi
Tilib delivering a sermon, with white hair and beard.' If we knew the
date when he left Kufah and when he came back to visit it, we would
know the exact date when the Shia in Kufah believed in what their
Imam believed in of the superiority of Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and
when they began to differ with 'Ali with regard to what he used to
believe and proclaim from the minbar of Kufah with regard to the
superiority of his two brethren, the two companions of the Messenger
of Allah (@),his two advisors, the two caliphs who became in charge
of the Ummah at the best and purest time in o u r h i s t o ~ y . " 'Layth
~ ~ ibn
Abi Sulaym said: "I met the first Shia and saw how they never
regarded anyone as superior to Abu Balcr and 'Umar."L95

(A),

The author of Mukhtu~urat-Tuhfuh said: 'Those of the
Muhzjireen and An& who lived at the time of 'Ali's caliphate, and
those who followed them in truth, all acknowledged 'Ali's virtue and
rights and recognised his status. They never undermined the position
of any of his fellow Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g),
let
alone accused one of being a disbeliever or slandered him."'96
Over the years, Shiism did not maintain this level of purity,
soundness and decency; the principles of Shiism changed, and the
Shia became divided into many groups. Shiism became a cover used
by everyone who wanted to plot against Islam and the Muslims,
encompassing the enemies who harboured grudges and envy. This is
why we call those who slander Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be
pleased with them) RZfiifiClis, because they do not deserve to be

314

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

described as ~ h i a . Anyone
'~~
who knows about the ideological
development of the Shia will not be surprised to find that there are a
number of prominent scholars of hadith, other scholars and other
prominent figures who were described as Shia, and they may be
among the prominent Sunni scholars. This is because Shiism, as a
concept and definition, at the time of the earliest generations was
different from the concept and definition of Shiism later on.
Adh-Dhahab'i said, when talking about those who were
accused of following the innovation of Shiism: "Innovation is of two
types: minor innovation, such as being extreme in Shiism or Sbiism
without going to extremes. This is found a great deal among the
Tibi'oon and their followers, even though their religious
commitment, piety and sincerity were great. If we were to reject
the narrations of these men, we would lose a large number of hadith
reports, and this would be a serious problem. Then there is major
innovation, such as complete Rifi&sm, going to extremes in that,
undermining the position of Abu Bakr and 'Umar (&) and
promoting such ideas. The reports of this type of people are not to be
accepted, and there is no respect for them. I cannot think of any of
this type who is sincere or trustworthy; rather their way is lying,
dissimulation (taqiyyah) and hypocrisy. How can the reports of such
a man be accepted? That is utterly impossible. At the time of the
earliest generation and according to their definition, the extreme Shia
was the one who criticised and slandered 'Uthmiin, az-Zubayr,
Tabah, Mu'iwiyah and a group of those who fought 'Ali (&). But
the extreme Shia nowadays, in our view, is the one who regards these
leaders as disbelievers and disavows Abu Bakr and 'Umar. Such a
person is misguided and a fabricator of lies."'98
So Shiism is of vaqing degrees, levels and stages, and the Shia
include various groups and sects. Before we begin our discussion on
the definition of Shiism, we may note that the definition of the Shia

i

I

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

31 5

that is mentioned in most of the books that talk about different sects
of Islam is that which persisted in describing the I m h i Shia as being
followers of 'Ali and the like.
This has led to a misconception that is contrary to the
consensus of the Ummah. This misconception states that 'Ali was a
Shia harbouring the same beliefs as the Shia, but in fact, 'Ali (&)
was innocent of what the Shia believe about him and his descendants.
It is essential to be more precise and careful when giving a definition,
so as to avoid confusion. It should be said that they are those who
claim to be followers of 'Ali. They did not follow 'Aliin any true
sense because Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) did not believe in what
they believed.199Or it may be said that they are the ones who claim to
be supporters of 'Ali (&), or they are R%@s. Hence some of the
scholars describe them as the R2fi@s who claim to be supporters of
'Ali
Moreover, they are not following in the footsteps of the
supporters and followers of 'Ali; they are impostors and ifi if id is.^^'

2.1.3. The meaning of the word 'rafq in Arabic
The word â€˜raft means rejecting, giving up, or abandoning.
For example, the phrase rafadtu ash-shay' means 'I rejected the
thing'.z0z

2.1.4. The meaning of the word 'Rsfidah'
in Islamic terminology
The R z d a h are one of the groups that claimed to be
supporters of Ah1 d-Bayt, while also disavowing Abu Bakr, 'Umar
and most of the Companions of the Prophet (g)
except a few of
them, denouncing them as disbelievers and reviling them.Z031mam

who disavowed, reviled and impugned the Companions of
Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (g).'

(may AUah have mercy on him) said: ''I asked my father about the

Bakr and 'Umar (&)."'205
Abu al-Qiisim at-Taymi said in Qawcim as-Sunnah, defining
them: "They are the ones who impugn Ahu Bakr and 'Umar (may
Allah be pleased with them both) and those who love them."2" The
R s ~ d a hwere unique, among all the groups who claim to belong to
the Muslim Ummah, in reviling the two shaykhs Abu Bakr and
'Umar. This is indicative of the severity of their doom and loss, may
Allah (;$B;) destroy them.'07
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "Ahu
Bakr and 'Umar (&) are hated and cursed by the R2fidah to the
exclusion of all other sects."20s The books of the R=dah c o n f i
this, because they regard love and support for the two shaykhs, or the
lack thereof, as the criteria that differentiates between them and
others whom they call Ng~ibis.Al-Darki narrated that Muhammad
ihn 'Ali ibn Moosa said: "I wrote to 'Ali ibn ~ u h a ~ n m about
a d ~the

N@ibi: 'With regard to testing him, is there any need for anything
more than his giving precedence to al-jibt ~ @ - : 6 ~ h o o tand

believing in their right to the caliphate?' The answer came back:
'Whoever believes that is a ~ 2 ~ i b i . " ' ~ "

2.1.5. The reason why they are called Riifidah
The majority of scholars think that the reason why the R z d i s
are so called is because they rejected (rafa&) Zayd ihn 'Ali and
abandoned him after being part of his army, when he rebelled against
H i s h h ibn 'Ahdnl-Malik in 121 AH. That was after they had
declared their disavowal of the two shaykhs [Ahu Bakr and 'Umar],
and he told them not to do that. Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari said: "Zayd
ibn 'Ali did not give precedence to 'Ali ibn Abi T2lih over the rest of
the Companions of the Messenger of AUah (s,);
he loved Abn Bakr

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

31 7

and 'Umar, but he believed that it was a religious duty to rise up
against unjust rulers. When he started his rebellion in Kufah with the
supporters who had swom allegiance to him, he heard some of them
disparaging Abu Bakr and 'Umar. Zayd denounced those from whom
he heard that, and those who had sworn allegiance to him separated
from him. He said to them: 'You have rejected me
(rafadtumo~ni)."'~~~
This was the view of the author of Qawrim
as-~unnah,~
a r' ~- ~ S l z i , ~ash-~hahrastiini~'~
'~
and Ibn ~ a ~ m i ~ a h , ~ ' ~
may AUah have mercy on them. Al-Ash'ari had a different opinion;
according to him, they were called R%@s because they rejected the
right to caliphate of Abu Bakr and mar.^'^

2.1.6. The R2fidis today
The R%fidis today hate this name and do not accept it; they
think that it is a name that was given to them by their opponents.
Muhsin al-Ameen says: "Ar-RiififidaJ7is a derogatory name that is
given to those who give precedence to 'Ali (&) with regard to the
caliphate, and this word is usually used as an insult and a putdown."218 Hence today they are called Sbia and have become known
by this name to most people. Some writers and educated people have
been influenced by that, so we see them using this term (Shia),
whereas in fact the word Shia is a general term which includes
everyone who supported 'Ali (&).'I9
The authors of books on
groups and sects stated that they are three types:
(a) Extremists, who are those who exaggerated about 'Ali
and claimed that he was divine or a prophet.

(4)

(b) R%fidis, who claimed that there is a divine text appointing
'Ali (&) as caliph. They disavow the caliphs who came
before him and most of the Companions.

(c) Zaydis, who are the followers of Zayd ibn 'Ali.They give
"precedence to 'Ali(&) over the other Companions, but

318

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia
they also love Abu Baler and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased
with them

Calling the Rzfidis 'Shia' without giving a proper definition of
the term is not correct, because this term 'Shia' includes the
~a~dis,''' who love Abu Bakr and 'Umar (&I.
Calling the Rzifidis
'Shia' may give the impression that they are like the early Shia at the
time of 'Ali (&) and afterwards, and all the earlier Shia were
unanimously agreed on the superiority of 'Abu Bakr and 'Umar over
'Ali. They only thought that 'Ali was superior to 'Uthmin, and this
group included many of the scholars and good and righteous people.
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "Hence
the early Shia who supported 'Ali or lived at that time did not dispute
the superiority of Abu Bakr and 'Umar; their dispute was as to
whether 'Ali or 'Uthm2n was superior."222 Calling the Rsfidis 'Shia'
is one of the obvious errors that some contemporary writers fell into
by following in the footsteps of the RZfifidis, who attempted to rid
themselves of this name because they realised that the early
generations condemned and hated them. They wanted to rid
themselves of the name by claiming to belong to the Shia in general,
as a kind of camouflage and deceit before those who do not know
about them. One effect of that is the mistake made by some beginner
seekers of knowledge, who do not fully understand the exact
meanings of terminology. They confuse the d i n g s that apply to the
Rzitfidiswith the rulings that apply to the Shia, because of the practice
of using the word 'Shia' to include the Rififidistoo. So they think that
what was mentioned by some early scholars concerning the Shia is
also applicable to the Rzifidis, whereas the scholars differentiate
between the two groups in all their rnl;Lgs.223
Therefore it is essential to call the RZfidis by their real name,
which was given to them by the scholars, and not to call them Shia in
an absolute sense, because that is causing confusion and

Xli ibn Abi Tilib

31 9

misunderstanding. If they are called 'Shia,' then something should be
added to it to indicate the particular group in question, such as saying
'the Imami Shia' or the 'Twelver Shia,' according to the custom of
the scholars when mentioning themF4 And Allah
knows best.

2.2. Origin of the R2fidi Shia
and the role of the Jews therein
The first one to promote the principles of R Z d i Shia beliefs,
on which their other beliefs are based, was a Jewish man from Yemen
whose name was Ahdullah ihn Saba'. He became Muslim at the time
of the Rightly Guided Caliph 'Uthmh ibn 'Aff2n (&) and travelled
throughout the Muslim regions to promote these corrupt beliefs.
At-Tabari wrote in his book of history: "Abdullah ibn Saba'
was a Jew from San'i', whose mother was a black woman. He
became Muslim at the time of 'UthmZn (&), then he travelled
through the lands of the Muslims, trying to misguide them. He stwed
in the Hijaz, then went to Basra, then Kufah, then Syria, hut he was
not able to achieve what he wanted with anyone among the people of
Syria. They expelled him, and he went to Egypt and lived there.
Among the things that he said to them was: 'It is very strange that
there are people who clajm that 'Eesa will return hut do not believe
that Muhammad will return, when Allah says: dVerily, He Who has
given you [O Muhammad] the Qur'an [i.e. ordered you to act on its
laws and to preach it to others] will surely, bring you back to Ma'dd
[place of return, either to Makkah or to paradise after your death1.B
(Qur'an 28: 85) Muhammad is more deserving of returning than
'Eesa.' This was accepted from him, and he explained to them the
concept of some of the Companions returning from the dead to he
judged before the Day of Resurrection, and they discussed it. After
that, he told them that there were one thousand prophets, that each
prophet had an appointed heir, and that 'Ali was the appointed heir of

320

'Ali's ammtudetowards the Kharijites and Shia

Muhammad. Then he said: 'Muhammad was the seal of the prophets,
and 'Ali was the seal of the appointed heirs.' He told them after that:
'Who is a greater wrongdoer than the one who did not carry out the
instrnction of the Messenger of Allah (&), who pushed away the
appointed heir of the Messenger of Allah (g)
and took control of the
Ummah's affairs?' Then he said to them: "Uthmib took it
unlawfully, and 'Ali is the appointed heir of the Messenger of Allah
(B),so do something about this matter and spread it among the
people. Start by criticising your governors, and show people that you
are enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, so that you
may gain the people's support and tell them about this matter.' Then
he sent his callers and wrote to those whose beliefs he managed to
corrupt in various regions, and they wrote to him."225
This was the beginning of the R=di movement. Those beliefs
to which Ibn Saba' called people continued to spread among people
of misguidance and deviation and continued to have an impact on
their hearts and minds until they resulted in the murder of the Rightly
Guided Caliph Dhun-Noorayn 'Uthmiin ibn 'Affiin (&) at the hands
these
of this corrnpt gang. At the time of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&I,
beliefs began to appear more than before, until they reached 'Ali
(&), who denounced them in the strongest terms, disavowing them
and those who believed in them. One of the sound reports from 'Ali
(&) concerning that is the report narrated by Ihn 'As2kir from
'Amm&ad-Duhani, who said: "I heard Abu at-Tufayl say: 'I saw alMusayyah ibn Lajabah bringing Ihn Saba', dragging him by the
collar, when 'Ali was on the minbar. 'Ali (4)
said: "What is the
matter with him?" He said: "He is telling lies about Allah and His
M e s ~ e n g e r . " " ' ~It~ ~was narrated via Yazeed ibn Wahh from
Salamah from Shu'bah that 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) said: "What do I
have to do with this rough black man?", refen& to Ahdnllah ibn
Saba', who used to slander Abu B a k ~and 'Umar (may Allah he

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

321

pleased with them).227 This report is proven to be from 'Ali (&)
with a sound chain of narration.22s
The historians and those who studied sects and groups narrated
that Ibn Saba' claimed that 'Ali (45) was divine, so 'Ali (&)
burned him and his companions with fire.229Al-Jurjini said: "The
Saba'is among the Rz&s are named after Abdullah ibn Saba', who
was the first of the R%&s to go beyond the pale of Islam. He said
that 'Ali was the Lord of the Worlds, so 'Ali burned him and his
companions with fire."230 Al-Malti said, while discussing the
Saba'is: "They are the followers of Abdullah ibn Saba'. They said to
'Ali: 'You.' He said: 'Who am I?' They said: 'The Creator.' He asked
them to repent but they did not recant, so he lit a huge fxe and burned
them."z31 Some of the historians are of the view that 'Ali (4)
did
not bum Ibn Saba'; they say that he banished him to al-Mad?in, and
that after 'Ali (&) died, Ihn Saba' claimed that he had not died,
saying to the one who announced his death: "Even if you brought us
his brain wrapped in seventy cloths, we would not believe that he had
died.n232
The first view is more likely to be correct, and it is supported
by what is narrated in Saheeh al-Bukhriri from 'Jkrimah who said:
"Some heretics were brought to 'Ali (&), and he burned them.
News of that reached Ibn 'Abbik, who said: 'If it were me, I would
not have burned them because of the prohibition of the Messenger of
Allah (B):"Do not punish with the punishment of Allah." But I
would have killed them, because the Messenger of Allah (g)
said:
"Whoever changes his religion, execute him.""'233 Ibn Hajar (may
Allah have mercy on him) commented on this hadith and quoted
some reports about these people who were burned, in which it was
said that they were people who used to worship idols; some reports
said that they were people who apostatised from Islam. Even though
the reports differ as to who exactly they were, Ihn Hajar said after

that: "Abu al-Mudhaffar
al-Isfariyeeni said in aE-Milal wan-Nihal
that those whom 'Ali burned were a group of the Rififidis who
claimed that he was divine. They were the Saba'is. Their leader
Abdullah ibn Saba' was a Jew who pretended to he a Muslim and
introduced this idea. This may be based on what we have reported
from Abu T a u al-Mnkhlis via Abdullah ibn Shurayk a l - ' b i n who
said: 'It was said to 'Ali (&):
"There are some people at the door of
,.
the mosque who are claiming that you are their Lord." He called
them and said: "Woe to you, what are you saying?' They said: "You
are our lord, creator and provider.""'z34 Then he quoted the rest of
the report, in which it says that 'Ali (&,) asked them to repent three
times, but they would not recant, so he bumed them with fire in
ditches that were dug for them. Ibn Hajar said: "This is a reliable
chain of narration."235
The point here is that the beliefs of the RZfia Shia that have to
do with exaggeration about 'ALi (&) emerged dnring that period,
and 'Ali (&) took harsh measures in punishing them until Ibn
'Abbh said what he said. 'Ali (4)
also denounced all the other
beliefs that appeared dnring his time under the umbrella of loving and
supporting him, such as prefemng him to the rest of the Companions
and giving him precedence over Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be
pleased with them both). The practice of reviling and disparaging the
Companions was widespread among these misguided people. Ibu
Taymiyah said: "When the Shia introduced innovations dnring the
caliphate of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi TZlib (&), he opposed
thenl. There were three groups: the extreme group, those who reviled
the Companions, and those who gave precedence to 'Ali
As for
the extreme group, he bumed them with fire. He went out one day
from the gate of Kindah, and some people prostrated to him. He said:
'What is this?' They said: 'You are Allah.' He asked them to repent
three times, hut they did not recant, so the thud time he ordered that
ditches be dug and fire be lit in thenl, then he threw them into them.

(4).

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilih

323

As for those who reviled the Companions, when news reached him of
the one who reviled Abu Bakr and 'Umar, he wanted to kill him, but
the man fled to Qarqaysiya' and (the governor there) spoke to him
concerning him. 'ALi (&) was very careful with his governors,
because he was not in full control, and they did not obey him in
everything he instructed them to do. As for those who gave him
precedence, he said: 'No one who prefers me over Abu Bakr and
'Umar is brought to me hut I shall flog him as the hadd punishment
for fabricators or liars.' It was narrated from him with more than
eighty chains of narration that he said: 'The best of this Ummah after
its Prophet is Abn Bakr, then mar."'^^^
Whatever the case may be, the beliefs of the Rifidis that
appeared at the time of 'Ali (&) were limited to a few individuals;
they did not reach the level of becoming a group or sect. When 'Ali's
caliphate came to an end, the situation was still like this.

Dr. Sa'di al-Hkhimi wrote an essay on the ideology of lbn
Saba' and the innovations that he promoted, entitled 7bn Saba' is a
Reality, not Myth', and he quoted it in his hook Narrators Who Were
Influenced by 1bn Saba'. The most significant innovation that was
promoted by lbn Saba' was the idea of appointing an heir. He was the
first one to say that the Messenger of Allah (&) appointed 'Ali as his
heir and that he was to he his successor in ruling his Ummah after his
death, according to an instruction in which 'Ali was mentioned by
name. He was also the first one to disavow the enemies of 'Ali (&),
according to his claim; he took a stand against them and deemed
them to be disbelievers. He was the f m t to say that 'Ali (&) was
divine and the first one among the extreme Shia to claim to be a
prophet. He introduced the idea that 'Ali (&) would return to this
world after he died and that the Messenger of Allah (g)
would
return. He was the first one to claim that 'Ali was the 'beast of the
earth'237
and that he was the one who created the universe and

324

'Ali's attitude toward~sthe Kharijites and Shia

granted provision. The Saba'is said that they would not die and that
they would fly after death, so they were referred to as something that
flies. Some of the Saba'is believed in the passing of the spirit from
one Imam to another, and they believed in the passing of souls from
one body to another at death. The Saba'is said: "We have been
guided to revelation from which people have gone astray and to
knowledge that is hidden from them." They said that 'Ali is in the
clouds, that the thunder is his voice and that the lightning is his whip.
These are the most prominent innovations believed by Ibn Saba' and
his followers, and they became extremists as a
The Riifidi Shiite sect, as an ideology and belief, did not
appear all at once; it took time and went through various stages. The
initial Shiite R%fi@ibeliefs and basic principles appeared at the hands
of the Saba'is, as is admitted in the Shiite books, which say that Ibn
Saba' was the first one to state that the imamate of 'Ali was a must
and that 'Ali was the appointed heir of Muhammad, as we have seen
above. According to this belief, there were instructions from the
Prophet (g)
that mentioned 'Ali by name and stated that he was to he
the Imam or caliph. This is the basis of R%@i Shiism, as the R%di
shaykhs see it. Abu al-Hasan said in al-K;fi: "The imamate of 'Ali
was written in all the books of the prophets, and Allah never sent any
Messenger without telling him of the prophethood of Muhammad
(g)
and the imamate of 'Ali (>=).2.239
The books of the Rifidi Shia, as we shall see below, testify that
Ibn Saba' and his group were the first ones to begin reviling Ahn
Bakr, Umar and 'Uthmsn, the in-laws, relatives and caliphs of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
and the closest of people to him, and
reviling other Companions. This is the belief of the Rsfi& Sbia about
the Companions, as it appears in their reference hooks.
Ibn Saba' believed that 'Ali would return,240and the return of
'Ali is one of the basic beliefs of the GfiG S h i as
~ we shall see

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

325

below. Ibn Saba' also believed that 'Ali and Ah1 al-Bayt were given
secret knowledge that was exclusive to them, as was mentioned by
d-Hasan ibn Muhammad ibn a l - ~ a n a f i ~ ~in
a hRiscilat
~~' al-~rja'.~~~
This issue became one of the basic beliefs of the Shia. There is a
proven report in Sahih Bukhari which indicates that this belief
appeared at an early stage, and that 'Ali (&) was asked about it. It
was said to him: "Do you have anything (of howledge) that is not in
the Qur'an and is not known to people?'He denied that
categorically.243
These are the most important of the basic principles in which
the R Z G Shia believe.z44These ideas came into existence after the
murder of 'Uthmzn (&) and during the caliphate of 'Ali (&), but
they were not embraced by a particular, known group. As soon as the
Saba'is began to raise their heads, Ali (&) fought them, as we have
seen. Later, though, events took place that created the right
environment for these beliefs to surface and take the shape of a
group; these incidents included the battle of Siffeen and the
arbitration that followed it, as well as the killing of 'Ali and al-Hasan.
All these events created passion, sympathy and love for Ah1 alBayt, and these new ideas snuck in under the pretext of support and
love for 'Ali (&) and the members of his family. Shiism became a
means for everyone who wanted to destroy Islam, whether he was a
heretic or a hypocrite or an evildoer. It introduced to the Muslims
foreign ideas and beliefs in the name of love for 'Ali and Ah1 al-Bayt,
and it made it easy for these ideas to penetrate smoothly in that guise.
Ibn Saba' had many successors, so with the passage of time, this
innovation began to broaden and its danger became great. At the time
of 'Ali (&), the word Shia was used only in the sense of love and
support for 'Ali (&), and it did not mean believing in any of the
ideas of the R Z d i Shia as they are known today at

326

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Shiism in the sense of love for Ah1 al-Bayt is something
natural. It is love that does not differentiate among the different
members of the Prophet's family and does not exaggerate about them
or undermine any of the Companions, as the groups that are
attributed to Shiism do. The love of Ah1 al-Bayt grew and increased
after the pain and suffering that they went through, starting with the
murder of 'Ali and then al-Husayn, and so on. These incidents
unleashed the emotions of the Muslims, and those who bore grudges
against Islam entered through this door. The views of Ibn Saba' did
not find a suitable atmosphere in which to grow and spread until after
these events.
However, Shiisrn in the sense of believing that 'Ali (&) was
mentioned by name to be the Imam or caliph and believing in the
return of some of the Companions from the dead to be judged before
the Day of Resurrection, in the doctrine of change in the divine will,
in the hidden Imam, in the infallibility of the Imams and so on is
undoubtedly a set of beliefs for which Allah (g)
has revealed no
authority, and these beliefs are foreign to the Muslims. Their origins
go back to various sources, because many people rode the wave of
Shiism -people who wanted to plot against Islam and its people and
who wanted to be able to continue living in the shade of their
previous beliefs in the name of Islam, whether they were Jews,
Christians, Magians or something else. Many corrupt beliefs were
introduced into Shiism, as we shall see below when we study their
basic beliefs. Ibn Taymiyah was of the view that those who claimed
to be Shia had adopted ideas from the Persians, Byzantines, Greeks,
Christians, Jews and others and mixed them with Shiism. He said:
"This is a confurnation of what the Prophet (B)said," and be quoted
some hadiths saying that this Urnmah would follow in the footsteps
of those who came before them. He also said that this happened with
those who claimed to be ~ h i a . ~ ~ ~

2.3. Stages that the Rsfidi Shia went through
The Rz& Shia went through a number of stages in their
development before they became an independent group with distinct
beliefs and a distinct name, separate from the other groups of the
Ummah. We may highlight four main stages of that development:

2.3.1.
The call of Abdullah ibn Saba' to whatever he promoted of
basic beliefs on which R Z d i doctrine was based, such as his
promotion of the belief that some Companions would return from the
dead to be judged before the Day of Resurrection, his introduction of
the idea that the Prophet (g)
had appointed 'Ali to be his successor,
and his slandering of the caliphs who came before 'Ali (&). Two
things helped Ibn Saba' to promote his misguided ideas, which are
far from the spirit of Islam:
(a) He chose a suitable environment. He spread his call in
Egypt and Iraq and moved between these regions a great
deal, as is mentioned by a t - ~ a b a r i .This
~ ~ appeal
developed in societies that had not managed to understand
Islam properly and did not have deep knowledge of the
religion of AUah (&) because they were new to Islam.
Those regions had only been conquered at the time of
'Umar (&), and the people were far away from the
society of the Companions in the area around Makkah and
Madinah, so they did not learn and study at their hands.
(b) By way of trickery and deceit, he concealed his call and
operated in secrecy. His call was not directed to everyone;
it was only directed to those whom he knew would accept
it, such as ignorant people and those with evil motives who
had only entered Islam in order to plot against its people,

328

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shia

afkr the Muslim armies had destroyed the thrones of their
kings and conquered their lands. We have seen above what
at-Tabari said about Ibn Saba': "He spread his call and
wrote to those whom he managed to c o m p t in other
regions, and they wrote to him. They called people in
secret to their ideas."248 At-Tabari said, describing them:
"They started spreading a lot of rumours (against the
governors) in Muslim lands, but their real aim was
different from what they ~howed.""~

The second stage came when they started promoting their
beliefs openly. This came after the murder of 'Uthm2n (&), when
the Companions (&) were focusing on suppressing the unrest that
had resulted in his murder. These misguided people found breathing
space in those circumstances, and their corrupt beliefs grew strong
and became deeply rooted in their hems, but these beliefs were still
limited to a small, specific group of those whom Ibn Saba' himself
had taught. They had no power or influence with anyone apart from
those of the rebel thugs who joined them in the murder of 'Uthm2n
(&). What is indicative of that is what was narrated by at-Tribrui:
"Ibn Saba' spoke and said: '0 people, your victory could come by
mixing with the people, so show kindness to them.'"250 Such words
would not be said by one who was in a position of power or
influence. Yet no one denies the role played by these Saba'is and the
killers of 'Uthrn2n (&) in fanning the flames of war among the
Companions; this was stated by scholars who studied the fitnah and
its events. Ibn Hazm says, confirming this: "The proof of that is that
the two armies came together (at the Battle of the Camel) and did not
fight, but atnight the murderers of 'Uthmzn (&) realised that the
two parties were going to be united against them, so they attacked the

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

329

camp of Talhah and az-Zuhayr at night, wielding their swords against
them, and the people had to defend themselves."251

The third stage involved their gaining strength and power and
rallying behind one leader. This happened after the murder of alHusayn (&), and the purpose was to avenge al-Husayn by
retaliating against his enemies. At-Tahari says conceming the events
of 64 AH: "In this year, the Shia began to mohilise in Kufah,
preparing to meet in an-Nakheelah in 65 AH in order to march on the
Syrians in a quest for vengeance for the blood of d-Husayn ihn 'Ali.
They corresponded with one another conceming that."252
Their story was narrated by at-Tabari in a report from
Abdullah ibn 'Awf ihn d-&mar d-Azdi, who said: "When d Husayn ibn 'Ali was killed and Ihn Ziyid returned from his camp in
an-Nakheelah and entered Kufah, the Shia met and blamed
themselves, regretting what had happened. They thought that they
had made a grievous mistake by calling d-Husayn and promising
support, then abandoning him so that he was killed near them without
their lending him any support. They thought that nothing could erase
their shame and the sin resulting from his murder except killing the
ones who had killed him or being killed in the attempt. So in Kufah,
they turned to five people who were leaders of the Shia: Sulaymb
ihn Surad d-Khuzi'i, who had met the Prophet 1%); al-Musayyah
ihn Najiyyah d-Fiziri, who bad been one of the most prominent
companions of 'Ali
Abdullah ibn Sa'd ihn Nufayl al-Azdi;
Abdullah ibn W2il at-Taymi; and Rifi'ah ibn Shaddid d-Bajali.
These five people then met in the house of Sulaymk ibn Surad. They
were among the most prominent of 'Ali's companions, and they were
joined by some of the most prominent of the ~ h i a . " ' ~ ~

(4);

330

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

This meeting was public and included all the Shia.
Approximately seventeen thousand rallied behind Sulaym&, but he
was not happy with their small numbers. He sent Hakeem ibn
Munqidh to give the call in Kufah, and the people came out to join
them until their number reached nearly twenty thousand.254Dnring
this time, al-MukhGr ibn Abi 'Ubayd ath-Thaqafi came to Kufah and
found that the Shia had rallied behind Sulaymiu ihn Surad; they were
showing him a great deal of respect and were preparing for war.
When al-Mukh6r settled among them in Kufah, he called for the
imamate of al-Mahdi Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib, namely
Muhammad ibn al-Hanatiyyah;he called him al-Mahdi, and many of
the Shia followed him in that, leaving Sulaymk ibn Surad.
Thus the Shia split into two groups. The majority of them were
with Sulaymk, wanting to go out to fight people so that they could
avenge the murder of al-Husayn. Another group was with alMukhtk, wanting to proclaim the imamate of Muhammad ibn alHanafiyyah, albeit without any instruction from Ibn al-Hanafiyyah
himself; they attributed that to him in order to deceive the people and
achieve their corrupt ulterior motives.255This is how the Shia began
to come together,
Then the historians tell us that Sulaymk ibn Surad set out for
Syria with those Shia who were still with him. They met the Syrians
at a spring called 'Ayn al-Wardah, where a great battle took place that
lasted for three days. Ibn Katheer said: "No one, old or young, had
ever seen anything like that day, when nothing intempted the
fighting except the times for prayer, until night
The fighting
between them ended with the killing of Sulaymh ibn Surad (may
Allah have mercy on him) and many of his companions; they were
defeated, and those of his companions who were left returned to
~ u f a h . ~ ~ ~

331

As for d-Mukhtk ibn Ahi 'Ubayd ath-Thaqati, when those
who survived of Sulaymh's army returned to Kufah, they told him
what had befallen them. He prayed for mercy for Sulaymin and those
who had been killed with him and said: "I am the trusted leader who
will kill the c o m p t tyrants inshallah. Get ready and prepare
yourselves, and be of good cheer." Ibn Katheer said: "Before (the
defeated army) anived, he had told the people that they had been
defeated on the basis of revelation that he had received from Satan, as
a devil used to come to him and reveal things to him in a manner
similar to the way Satan used to reveal things to ~ u s a ~ l i m a hAl."~~~
Mukhtar sent instructions to differentregions, cities and towns in Iraq
and Khorasan and organised his army. Then he st&ed to pursue the
murderers of d-Husayn, whether they were of prominent or lowly
position, and kill them?59

The fourth stage was the split of the Rififidi Shia from the
Zaydis and other Shia groups, and their becoming distinct in name
and beliefs. That happened specifically in 121 AH, when Zayd ibn
'Ali ibn d-Husayn rebelled against H i s h h ibn 'Ahdul-Malik, as
mentioned previously?60 Some of the Shia in his army openly
reviled Abu Bakr and 'Umar. He told them not to do that and
denounced them, but they rejected (rafaQa) what he said and thus
became known as R z ~ d i swhile
,
the group that remained with him
became known as ~ a ~ d i s Ibn
? ~ Taymiyah
'
said: "The first time that
the word Rifidi was known in Islam was when Zayd ibn 'Ali rebelled
at the beginning of the second c e u t q AH. He was asked about Abu
Bakr and 'Umar (&), and he expressed love and respect for them,
but some people rejected him and became known as if id is."^^^ He
said: "From the time of Zayd's rebellion, the Shia split into Rifidis
and Zaydis. When Zayd was asked about Ahu Bakr and 'Umar, he
prayed for mercy for them, and some people rejected that. He said to

332

'Ali's attitude towards the Khaiijites and Shia

them: 'You have rejected me.' So they were called Efidis because of
their rejection of him, and those Shia who did not reject him were
called Zaydis, after him."263 From that dale, the R%&s became
distinct from other Shia groups and became a separate sect with their
own name and beliefs.z64 And Allah
knows best.

(a)

The scholars who discussed different sects talked about
different groups which claimed to be Shia, among whom they
mentioned the Saba'is, the Ghuribis, the Bayitis, the Mugheenis, the
Hishimis, the Khagbis, the 'IlbZ'is, the KaysZnis, the Zaydis, the
Jaroodis, the Sulaymhis, the S%his and the Batris. Some of these
groups went to extremes, and others were less extreme. The one who
wants to know more about them may refer to Maqcil6t al-lslemiyyeen
by Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari, al-Milal wan-Nib1 by ash-Shahastihi,
Al-Furq bayna al-Firaq by Abudh-Dh&r
-- al-Bagbdadi and Firaq
Mu'ijirah by Dr. Ghilib ihn 'Ali 'Awiji, who is one of the best
contemporary writers I have come across.

3. Beliefs of the Imami Rsfidi Shia
The Twelver REifidi Shia believe that imamate is an important
pillar of Islam and one of the fundamentals of faith; a person's faith is
not complete, and no deed may be accepted from hi, unless he
believes in it. The first person who spoke of the concept of imamate
as believed in by the R2fidi Shia was Ibn Saba'. He spread the idea
that imamate was something about which the Prophet (g)
gave
instructions, that it is limited to the one whom he mentioned in those
instructions (the appointed heir), and that if anyone other than him
takes the position of imamate (or caliphate), he must be disavowed
and regarded as a disbeliever.
The books of the Shia admit that Ibn Saba' was the first one to
spread the idea of 'Ali's imamate being obligatory, openly

'Ali ibn Abi Telib

333

disavowing his enemies, standing up to his opponents and
denouncing them as disbeliever^.^'^ He was of Jewish origin, and he
believed that the one who was instructed by Moosa to take his place
was Joshua; when he became Muslim be applied this same idea to
'Ali ibn Abi mib.266 This is what was agreed upon by the shaykhs of
the R Z d i Shia.
Ibn Bi'ibawayh al-Qummi recorded the beliefs of the Shia in the
fourth century AH, and he said that they believed that evey prophet
had an appointed heir whom Allah (&) instructed should come after
the prophet.267 He stated that the number of appointed heirs was
124,000.~'~
Al-Majlisi stated in his AkhbLirthat 'Ali was the last of the
appointed heirs.269 One of the chapter headings in al-Kij? says:
"Imamate is a covenant from AUah (&), which is passed on from one
to another."270 Another heading says: "What Allah (&) and His
Messenger instructed with regard to the Imams and mentioning their
names one after another."271 He included a number of their reports,
which they regard as evidence beyond any shadow of a doubt.
Hence their shaykh Miqdid al-mli (d. 821 AH) said: "The
one who is entitled to the position of imamate has to be a man who is
appointed by Allah and His Messenger, not just by any man."272
Muhammad Husayn .&
Kishif
l al-Ghata', one of the senior religious
authorities of the Twelver Sbia in modem times, stated: "Imamate is a
divinely-appointed position like prophethood. Just as AUah chooses
whomever He wills among His slaves for prophethood and
messengership and supports them with miracles which are like a
statement from AUah concerning him, so He also chooses for
imamate whomever He wills and enjoins His Prophet to mention him
by name as his successor and issue instructions that he should be a
leader (Imam)for people after he is gone."273
So you see that the concept of imamate in their view is like the
concept of prophethood. Just as Allah chose prophets from among

334

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites andshin

His creation, He also chooses Imams, mentioning them by name,
telling mankind about them, establishing proof through them,
supporting them with miracles, and sending down Books and
revelation to them. They do not say or do anything except by the
command and revelation of Allah. In other words, imamate is the same
as prophethood, and the Imam is aProphet; the change is in name only.
Hence al-Majlisi said: "Trying to work out the difference
between a Prophet and an Imam based on these reports may be
problematic."274 Then he said: "We do not h o w the reason why
they are not given the title of prophet except as a kind of respect to the
Seal of the Prophets; our minds cannot fathom the difference between
propbethood and
This is what they say with regard to
the concept of imamate, and it is sufficient criticism of it that they
have no support for this view except (the words of) Ibn Saba', the
~ew."~

3.1. The status of the Imam in their view,
and the ruling on the one who denies it
For the Sunnis, the issue of imamate (caliphate or rulership) is
not one of the basic fundamentals of religion that a Muslim cannot
afford to be unaware of, and this has been stated by a number of
~cholars.'~'According to the Ufi& Shia, though, it is something else
altogether. In al-Kifi, there are reports that describe imamate as the
greatest pillar of Islam. Al-Kulayni narrated, with his chain of
narration from Abu Ja'far, that the latter said: "Islam is built on five
billars): the prayer, zaka, fasting, hajj and imamate. There is no
issue that is emphasised as much in Islam as imamate. The people
took four and they abandoned this - meaning imamate."278
You can see that they dropped the twin declaration of faith
from the five pillars of Islam and replaced it with imamate, which
they regard as the greatest of the pillars, as is indicated by their

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

335

saying: "There is no issue that is emphasised as much in Islam as
imamate," and by other words of theirs, such as the text quoted
above, to which the narrator added: "I said: 'Which is the best of
these?' He said: 'Imamate is the best."'z79
Al-Majlisi said: "No doubt belief in the imamate of the Imams
and submitting to their authority are among the fundamentals of faith.
and better than all physical acts of worship because these are the
starting point."280
Al-Mudhaffar,
who is one of their contemporary scholars,
says: "We believe that imamate is one of the fundamentals of
religion, and that faith is not complete without believing in it. It is not
permissible to imitate parents, family or educators, no matter how
great they are; rather it is essential to examine the issue, just as it is
essential to examine the issues of tawheed and prophethood."281The
reports go even further than that, as they say: "The Prophet f&)
taught more about the imamate of 'Ali and the Imams who came after
him than he taught about obligatory
These reports of the RZ& Shia, and others like them in the
books of the R%i& Shia, were enough to make the issue of imamate
the criterion to judge whether a man was a believer or a disbeliever,
and to leave the Muslim exposed to accusations of disbelief for
merely differiug with the Imami Shia with regard to the issue of
imamate, in which they believe. Hence we see some senior Shiite
scholars, both earlier and later, frankly stating this bitter truth,
Ibn Bzbawayh al-Qummi said, in his essay al-l'tiqzdzt: "Our
belief about those who deny the imamate of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
ibn Abi T2ib (&) is the same as that about one who denies the
prophethood of all the prophets, and our belief about the one who
affirms the imamate of 'Ali and denies one of the Imams who came
after him is that he is like one who affirms all the prophets but denies
the prophethood of Muhammad (@)."283

336

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Yoosuf al-B-i
says in his encyclopaedia al-Hadri'iq anNridirah j5 Ahkrim al-'Ztrah at-T6hirah: "I wonder what difference
there is between one who disbelieves in Allah
and His
Messenger, and one who disbelieves in the Imams, even though it is
proven that imamate is one of the fundamentals of religion."284

(s)

Al-Majlisi says: "It should be noted that the fact that the words
polytheism and disbelief are applied to the one who does not believe
in the imamate of 'Ali and the Imams who are descended from him,
and believes that others are superior to them, indicates that they will
abide forever in
Ibn al-Mutahhar al-Hilli said: "Imamate is a general mercy,
and prophethood is a more specific mercy, because it is possible for
there to be a time without a living prophet, which is not the case with
regard to the Imam. Denying general mercy is worse than denying
specific mercy."286
He describes the one who does not believe in their Imams as
being worse in disbelief than the Jews and Christians. Based on that,
he says that there should never be any time without an Imarn. This is
a reference to their belief in the existence of a hidden, awaited Imam,
which is something that is rejected by many Shiite groups. The
scholars of genealogy and histoty who examined this issue stated that
this Imam was never even born, hut here a shaykh of the RX~LfidiShia
says that denying him is worse than disbelief!287
Their shaykh, al-Mufeed, stated that there was consensus
among them on this view of regarding the Ummah of Islam as
disbelievers. He says: "The Imamis are agreed that the one who
denies the inlamate of one of the Imams, and rejects what Allah (&)
has enjoined upon him of obedience to the Imams, is a misguided
disbeliever who deserves to abide forever in
The matter
went so far that their shaykh Ni'matullah al-JazZ'iri declared the Shia

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

337

to be separate from the Muslims because of the issue of imamate. He
said: "We do not have either a God or a Prophet or an Imam in
common with them, because they say that their Lord is the one
Whose Prophet Muhammad (gJ
is, and his successor who came after
him was Abu Bakr, but we do not believe in that Lord or in that
Prophet; rather we say that the Lord whose Prophet's successor was
Abu Bakr is not o w Lord, and that Prophet is not our Prophet."289
So imamate is at the same level as prophethood, if not greater.
It is the basic foundation of religion, in their view. Hence the ruling
of the Twelver Shia against anyone who denied the imamate of any
one of their twelve Imams gave the final shape to their extremism, as
they deemed him to he a disbeliever who was doomed to spend
eternity in hell, and they included in their curses and rulings of
apostasy all Muslim groups except the Twelvers. They included in
their denunciation as disbelievers all of the following:

3.1.1. Their denunciation of the Companions (&)
The hooks of the RZifidi Shia are filled with curses and
condemnation as disbelievers for those with whom Allah ( B )is
pleased and who are pleased with Him: the Muh2jireen and An&
those who were present at Badr, those who swore allegiance to the
Prophet (&) in the pledge of Radwk, and the rest of the
Companions, with only a very few exceptions who can be counted on
the fingers of one hand. After it appeared in their books and became
widely known, this became one of the issues that could not he
concealed by means of taqiyyah.z90
Some of the scholars who studied Shiite sects and groups
examined this issue among the Twelver Shia. AI-QZdi 'Abdul-Jabb2r
said: "As for the Imamis, they are of the view that the way to prove
the imamate of the twelve Imams is by means of the clear text that
denounces as disbelievers those who deny it, as they must be

3

'Ali's attitude towards the Khurijites and Shia

denounced as disbelievers. Hence they regard the Companions of the
Prophet (&) as di~believers."'~' Something similar was said by
'Abdul-Q%r al-Baghdadi.
As for the Imamis, most of themz9' claimed that the
Companions apostatised after the death of the Prophet (g),
except
for 'Ali (&), his two sons and a small number of others, making a
total of t h i ~ t e e n . ~Ibn
~ ' Taymiyah said: "The Riififidis say that the
Muhiijireen and An?% concealed the Prophet's clear instructions (to
appoint 'Ali as caliph) and disbelieved, spat from a small group, a
little over ten or more. Then they said: 'Abu Bakr, 'Umar and others
like them had always been hypocrites,' and they said: 'Rather, they
believed then they disbelieved.' The books of the Twelvers say that
the Companions apostatised because they appointed Abu Bakr as
caliph, with the exception of three of them. Some of their reports add
three or four others to Imam 'Ali, bringing the total to seven, but they
did not add more than that. The Shia narrated this myth in their socalled reliable books and recorded it in the first book of theirs that
appeared, which was the book of Sulaym ibn ~ a ~ s . " ' ~ ~
Then their books came one after another to confirm and
propagate this idea. Foremost among them are al-Kij, which is
regarded as the most authentic of their four books; R@l al~ a s h s h i , 'which
~ ~ is their main reference concerning the biographies
of narrators; and other references of theirs.296We will discuss the
attitude of the R2fifidi Shia towards the Companions (may Allah be
pleased with them) in detail below.

3.1.2. Their denunciation of
Ahl al-Bayt as disbelievers
The reports accusing the members of that unique and ideal
society of apostasy do not make exceptions for any of them except
seven individuals, according to the highest estimate. These seven do

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

339

not include any member of the household of the Messenger of Allah
(@), apart from a few of their reports which make an exception only
for 'Ali (&). This is the report of al-Fudayl ibn Yas& from Abu
Ja'far, who said: "All of the people became people of ignorance
except four: 'Ali, al-Miqdid, S a l m h and Ahu Dharr. I (al-Fudayl)
said: 'And 'Ammk?' He said: 'If you want those who never faltered
at all, then it is these three."'z97
The verdict of apostasy in these texts includes all of the
Companions and the household of the Prophet, such as the wives and
relatives of the Messenger of Allah (@), even though the fabricator
claims to be a supporter of Ah1 al-Bayt. This is clear evidence that
claiming to be supporters of the Prophet's household (Shiism) was no
more than a cover under which to cany out evil ulterior motives
against Islam and its people, and that the fabricators of these reports
were enemies of the Companions and relatives of the Prophet (@).298
The Rififidi Shia focused their slander and accusations of
disbelief on a number of the members of the family of the Messenger
of Allah
They said that the verse dAnd whoever is blind in this
world [i.e., does not see Allah's Signs and believes not in Him], will
be blind in the hereafter, and more astray from the Path) (Qur'an 17:
72) was revealed concerning his paternal uncle alL'Abb6. They also
singled out AbduUah ibn 'Abbh, the scholar of the Ummah and the
interpreter of the Qur'an; they cursed him and described him as a
'foolish man',299 as it says in al-Kc$. In Rijcil al-Kashshi, it says: "0
Allah, curse the two sons of so-and-so, blind them as You blinded
their hearts, and make the blindness of their eyes a proof of the
blindness of their heart^."^'' Their Shaykh Hasan al-Mustafawi
commented on this: "They are Abdullah ibn 'Abbss and 'Ubaydnllah
ibn ' ~ h b L . " ~ ~ ~

(a).

The daughters of the Prophet (s)
are also included in the
hatred and resentment of the Twelver Shia, who do not mention them

340

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

among those excluded from their accusations of becoming
disbelievers (after the death of the Prophet). Some of them even
denied that the Prophet (s)
had any daughters apart from F2Ciah
(r+&).302
Can the one who says such things about the Messenger of
Allah
and his daughters really love the Messenger of Allah?303

(s)

The author of al-Ki$ said in his reports that everyone who
does not believe in the twelve Imams is a disbeliever, even if he is
descended from 'Ali and ~ i t i m a h . ~In' ~reality, this implies that the
entire generation of the Companions and those who came after them,
including Ah1 alBayt and the Companions, are dishelievers because
they did not know about the idea of the twelve Imams, which did not
exist until after 260 AH.
This also implies that the Mothers of the Believers, the wives
of the Messenger of Allah (g),
were disbelievers, since they did not
exempt a single one of them in their texts. They particularly focused
on ';l'ishah305 and ~ a f ~ a (may
h ~ ' AUah
~
be pleased with them) for
their criticism, curses and denunciation as disbelievers.307 Their
sbaykh al-Majlisi wrote a chapter entitled Bib Ahwil 'ii'ishah wa
Hajjah in which he quoted seventeen reports,?08 and referred the
reader to more reports in other chapters,309 which offend the
Messenger of Allah (g)
with regard to the members of his
household, in the most abhorrent terms. In their reports, they even
accused the one whom AUah (&) declared to he innocent from
above seven heavens, 'A'ishah bint as-Siddeeq, of immoral conduct.
In the most prominent of their tafseers, Tafieer a l - ~ u r n r n i ,there
~ ' ~ is
a homble slander which implies disbelief in the noble Qur'an. Ibn
Katheer said in his comment?ty on Soorat an-Noor: "The scholars
(may AUah have mercy on them) are unanimously agreed that the one
who reviles her and accuses her after this which is mentioned in this
verse is a disbeliever, because he is stubbornly rejecting the
~ u r ' a n . " ~ "Al-Qurtubi said: "Everyone who reviles her by accusing

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

341

her of that which AUah (&) has declared her innocent of is
disbelieving AUah ( B ) and
, whoever disbelieves Allah (g)
is a
di~believer."~'~

3.1.3. Their denunciation of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs and their governments as disbelievers
According to the Imami Riifidi Shiite religion, any
government other than an Imami Riifi@ govemment is invalid;
its ruler is an unjust oppressor who is being worshipped instead of
Allah
and the one who swears allegiance to him is worshipping
something other than Allah (&). Al-Kulayni confirms this in a
number of chapters, such as his chapter on "One who claims to be a
ruler but is not qualified to rule, one who denies the Imams or some
of them, and one who a f f i s the imamate (rulership) of one who is
not qualified for it," in which he mentions twelve hadiths from their
~ m a m s ; and
~ ' ~his chapter on "The one who accepts the authority of
the ruler who has no sanction from Allah (;gig.)," which includes five
hadith~.~'~

(s),

According to their point of view, all the caliphs of the Muslims
- apaa from 'Ali (&) and d-Hasan - are unjust and evil, even if
they call people to the truth, treat Ah1 d-Bayt kindly and establish the
religion of AUah (B).
They say, "Every banner that is raised before
the banner of the awaited Mahdi, the one who raises it is unjust and
evil."315 The commentator on al-Kc?$ said: "Even if the one who
raises it calls people to the
Al-Majlisi deemed this report to
be sound3" according to their standards.318

3.1.4. Judging Islamic regions
to be 'the abode of disbelief'
In some of their reports, many Muslim countries are singled
out for slander, and their people are deemed to be disbelievers in

342

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

particular. Usually they target regions where the people are adhering
more to Islam and following the Sunnah. They stated that the people
of Makkah and Madinah were disbelievers during the best
generations. At the time of Ja'far as-Sidiq, they said of the people of
Makkah and Madinah: "The people of Syria are worse than the
people of Byzantium (meaning, worse than the Christians); the
people of Madinah are worse than the people of Makkah, and the
people of Makkah openly show disbelief in ~ l l a h . " ~They
' ~ also
said: "The people of Makkah openly show disbelief in Allah, and the
people of Madinah are more evil than the people of Makkah, seventy
times more evil."3z0

It is well known that the people of Madinah, especially during
the best generations, were following in the footsteps of the
Messenger of Allah (B)more than the people of other regions, and
the people of Madinah continued to adhere to their M a k i madl-hab
until the beginning of the sixth century AH or thereabouts, when
some of the Rsifidis from the east came and corrupted many of
them?"
They said of Egypt and its people: 'The sons of Egypt are
cursed on the lips of Diwood (-1,
and Allah (&) turned some of
them into monkeys and pigs."3ZZ~hey
said: "When Allah (&) got
angry with the children of Israel, He caused them to enter Egypt, and
when He was pleased with them, He caused them to leave it."323
They also said: "What a bad land Egypt is. It was aprison for those of
the children of Israel with whom Allah
was angry."324~ndthey
said: "Avoid Egypt and do not seek to stay there, because staying
there makes one a

(s)

They have a number of reports that criticise Egypt, slander its
people and warn against living there. They attribute these reports to
the Messenger of Allah (&), Muhammad al-BZqir and 'Ali al-B2qir.
This was the R Z d i view of Egypt at the time when Islam was

Xli ibn Abi Tcilib

343

flourishing. Al-Majlisi commented on these texts by saying that
Egypt had "become one of the worst of lands at that time, because its
people were among the most wretched and doomed of

disbeliever^."^^^
These texts express the Rsfidi's resentment and grudges
against Egypt and its people, and it is not far-fetched to suggest that
these feelings were due to the fall of the state of their brethren the
Ismajli 'Ubaydis at the hand of Saladin, who cleansed Egypt of their
filth and impurity. What comparison can there be between these
unjust words against Egypt and its people and the chapter that
Muslim included in his Saheeh under the title 'The Prophet's
instructions to he kind to the people of ~
~
~ The~R%@s
t
"
criticised many regions of the Islamic world and their people,328and
they did not exempt anyone except those who followed their sect,
who were very few at that time. It is even narrated that they said:
"Allah commanded people to love and support us and offered that to
the people of different regions, but no one accepted it except the
people of ~ u f a h . " ~ ' ~

3.1.5. The Muslim judges
Their reports regard the Muslim judges
as evildoers because of
rhcirconnccrio~~
IO the. caliphate, which i h q >ec.~lr
a 'Ill,' ;~urhont!'.
Ir 1s nurr:nc.d in rrl-KG/i th:n 'Illn~cl.ihn ilantlhalah
- \aid: "1 asketl Abu

about two of our companions who had a dispute about
a debt or inheritance, and they referred their case to the ruler and to
the judge; is that permissible?" He said: "Whoever refers to them for
judgement, whether the case is valid or not, he is referring for
judgement to false judges. Whatever is ruled in his favour, he is only
taking something h&m, even if it is his proven right, because he is
taking it on the basis of the ruling of false judges, and Allah has
enjoined us to reject it."330Allah (&) says: (And they wish to go for

~

344

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

judgement [in their disputes] to the T6ghoot [falsejudges] while they
have been ordered to reject them) (Qur'an4: 60). Tnis report criticises
the judges and judiciary system at the time of Ja'far as-Sidiq, as is
clear from their chains of narration going hack to him. If this was
their opinion of the Muslim judges during the best generations, then
what do you think is the opinion about those who came after
them?331

3.1.6. The imams and scholars of the Muslims
They warned against learning from the shaykhs and scholars
of the Muslims, regarding them as people of polytheism. It was
narrated that Haroon ibn Khirijah said: "I said to Abu Abdullah
(!ii):
'We go to those people who differ from
and listen to their
tak, so that it might be proof for us against them.' He said: 'Do not
go to them and do not listen to them, may Allah curse them and their
polytheist ways."'333 In al-Kij?, it is narrated from Sudayr that Ahu
Ja'far said: "0 Sudayr, shall I show you those who divert people
away from the religion of Allah?" Then he looked towards Abu
Haneefah and Sufyin ath-Thawri, who were sitting in circles in the
mosque, and he said: "These are the ones who divert people away
from the religion of Allah without knowledge, or guidance, or a Book
giving light.334These are the evildoers; if they sat at home, people
would look for someone to learn from, and they would not find
anyone tell to them about Allah (&) or about His Messenger (@J, so
they would come to us, and we would tell them about Allah (@) and
about His Messenger ( B ) . " ~ ~ ~
Ibn Taymiyah explained their attitude towards the early
generations and leading scholars of this Ummah, the An$%, and those
who followed them in truth, those with whom Allah is pleased and
who are pleased with Him. They describe as disbelievers the majority
of the Ummah of Muhammad (g),
~- both the earlier and later

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

345

generations. They describe as disbelievers everyone who believes
Abu Bakr, 'Umar, the Muhijireen and the An& to be of good
character, or who is pleased with them as Allah ($) is pleased with
them, or whoprays for forgiveness for them as Allah
has enjoined
us to pray for forgiveness for them. Hence they regard as disbelievers
the most prominent scholars of the Ummah, such as Sa'eed ibn alMusayyab, Abu Muslim al-Khawlini, Uways al-Qurani, 'Ata' ibn Abi
Rab% and Ibr2heem an-Nakha'i, as well as Imam M&k, al-Awzi'i,
Imam Abn Haneefah, Hammid ibn Zayd, Hammid ibn Salamah, athThawri, Imam ash-Sh2fafa'i,Imam b a d ibn Hanbal, Fudayl ibn
' I y 8 , Abu Sulaymin ad-D2rini, Ma'roof al-Karkhi, al-Junayd ibn
Muhammad, Sahl ibn Abdullah at-Tastari and others.

(s)

This alleged disbelief is worse than that of the Jews and
Christians, because the latter in their view are originally disbelievers,
but these people are considered apostates - and according to
scholarly consensus, the disbelief of apostasy is worse than original
disbelief. Most of their scholars regard Abu Bakr, 'Umar, the
majority of the Muhijireen and An$%, the wives of the Prophet (gJ
such as 'kishah and Haf~ah,the rest of the leaders and scholars of
the Muslims and their common folk as not having believed in Allah
(&) even for a second, because faith which is followed by disbelief,
in their view, is invalid in the first place. Some of them even suggest
that the private parts of the Prophet (BJ,with which he had intimate
relations with 'kishah and H a a h , should be touched by fire in
order to be purified from having had intercourse with women whom
they claim to be disbelievers, because intercourse with disbelieving
women is h a r h in their view.336
No one was safe from this comprehensive denunciation of
people as disbelievers. Does it need any further examination? Its
falseness is too apparent to require additional explanation. Regarding
the Ummah as disbelievers is an extension of regarding the

346

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Companions as disbelievers; the reason for it is the same and not
different. It is not surprising that the one who resents the Companions
of the Messenger of AUah (g),
reviles them and regards them as
disbelievers will also resent the entire Ummah and regard them as
disbelievers. As one of the early generation said: "Anyone who bears
grudges in his heart against any of the Companions of the Messenger
will have more resentment in his heart towards the
of Allah (g)
~uslims."'~'
If such a person does not approve of Abu Bakr, 'Umar,
'Uthmk, those who were present at Badr, those who swore
allegiance in the pledge of Radwh, and the Muhzjireen and An$%,
who represent the pinnacle of virtue and goodness, will he approve of
anyone after them? The basis of this attitude is the claim of the
RZ~disthat the Companions (&) denied the divine instruction
appointing an heir to the Prophet (g),
and we will explain that this
so-called divine instruction is false on the basis of texts, reason and
well known facts. What is based on falsehood is also false.
Their verdict of apostasy against the generation of the
Companions is one of the clearest signs of the utter falseness of the
R Z d i Shiite ma~Ih-hab.~~*
Hence Ahmad al-Kasrawi, an Iranian of
Shiite background, said: "As for what they said about the apostasy of
the Muslims after the death of the Prophet (g),
this is a blatant lie
and fabrication on their part. One might ask: How could they
who
apostatise when they were the Companions of the Prophet (g),
believed in him when others disbelieved, who protected him and put
up with persecution? How could they then apostatise during the
caliphate of Abu Bakr and leave their religion in order to make him
the caliph? Which of the two matters is easier to believe or more
likely to have happened: to disbelieve one or two men who had
corrupt motives or that a few hundred of the most sincere Muslims
would apostatise? Give us your answer, if you have any answer."339

Xli ibn Abi Tiilib

347

In the noble Qur'an, Allah ( g ) explains the basic principles of
faith, and it is an explanation or exposition of all things. Allah ( B )
says: dAnd We have sent down to you the Book [the Qur'an] as an
exposition of everything) (Qur'an 16: 89). Allah ( g ) says, describing
His Book, that it omits no matter on which religion is based: (We
have neglected nothing in the Book) (Qur'an 6: 38). If that is the case,
one may wonder: what is the basis of Shiite beliefs? The sacred book
of Islam, the Qur'an, mentions prayer, fasting, zakih and hajj many
times, but it makes no reference to the twelve Imams or to the
imamate (caliphate) after the Messenger, even though the imamate
a c c o r d i n g to the theory of the Rsidi Shia -is the most important
pillar of Islam! Is it not strange that the Qur'an mentions the details of
how to do wudoo', lists the h a r k types of food and drhk, speaks of
jihad sometimes and of peace sometimes, and discusses moral issues,
but it ignores the imamate of the twelve Imams, which is described
by h Kishif al-Ghata' as being a "divinely-ordained position like
prophethood"? These Qur'anic texts clearly testify that the noble
Qur'an did not neglect any issue that people need. So how could it
neglect the issue of imamate, which is supposed to be based on a
text? The Imami Shia talk about it and then leave it for their scholars
to shape and define this idea, when the appointment of the Imams
was supposed to come from Allah ( B )and not from them.340

3.2. Infallibility according to the Riifidi Shia
Infallibility of the Imam, according to the Imami Rifidi Shia,
is one of the conditions of imamate, and it is one of the basic
principles and foundations of their belief. It is of major importance
for them and is a result of the qualities, abilities and unlimited
intellectual talents that the Shia ascribed to their Imams. They believe
that the Imam is not answerable to any person, and that it is
impossible for him to make a mistake, no matter how many actions

348

'Ali's attitude towards the Khariiites and Shia

he does. It is essential to believe that everything he does is good, with
nothing evil in it, because he has knowledge that no one else can
possess. Hence the Shia ascribed infallibility to the Imam, among
other things. They believe that the Imams are infallible throughout
their lives and do not commit any sin, major or minor. They commit
no act of disobedience, and it is not possible for them to make
mistakes or forget.341
Their Shaykh al-Mufeed narrated that there was consensus on
this point, and he said: "The Imams, who take the place of the
prophets in fulfilling Sharia rulings, carrying out hadd punishments,
protecting the religion of Islam and disciplining the people, are
infallible like the prophets. It is not possible for them to commit any
major or minor sin, and it is not possible for them to be forgetful or
m&e mistakes in any matter of religion or rulings. This is the view of
all the Imamiyyah, except for those who are regarded as odd among
them and adhered to the apparent meaning of some reports that could
have an interpretation different than their corrupt understanding in
this regard."342 Ihn al-Mulahhar d-Hilli said: 'The Imamis and
Ismailis are of the view that the Imam must be infallible, and they
differed in that from all other
This was also stated by al-Majlisi when he said: "It should be
noted that the Imamis, may Allah be pleased with them, agree on the
infallibility of the Imams
who are free from sin, both minor and
major. They do not commit any sin at all, whether deliberately, or
because of forgetfulness or mistakes in interpretation, or because
Allah (g)
caused them to forget."344

(m),

AS-Sadooq narrated with a chain of narration going back falsely -to Ihn 'Abbb that he said: "I beard the Messenger of Allah
(g)
say: 'I, along with 'Ali, d-Hasan, al-Husayn and nine of the
descendants of al-Husayn, are infallible.'"345 He also said, affirming
that: "Our belief concerning the Prophets, Messengers and Imams is

Xli ibn Abi Tilib

349

that they are infallible and purified from all impurity. They do not
commit sin, minor or major; they do not disobey Allah (&) in what
He commands them; and they do what they are instructed. Whoever
denies that they are infallible in any way is ignorant of them, and the
one who is ignorant of them is a d i ~ b e l i e v e r . " ~ ~
This belief was not limited to the early generations of the
Rififidis; it is also shared by many contemporary Shia. Muhammad
Rida al-Mudhaffar
says: "We believe that the imam,like the Prophet,
must be infallible and protected against all things and immoral
actions, both open and hidden, from childhood until death, whether
those actions are deliberate or by mistake. He must also be infallible
and protected against absentmindedness, mistakes and
forgetf~lness."'~~
This was stated by az-Zanjki in 'AqG'id alImamiwah 348 and also by al-Bahrini in Manir al-Huda 349 and asSayyid Murtada al-'Askari in Ma'Glim a l - ~ a d r a s a t a ~ n . ~ ~ '
However, there are some reports in the Imami Shiite madh-hab
that contradict this view. Al-Majlisi was baffled when he saw texts
that are contrary to the consensus of his companions, and he said:
"The matter is very problematic because there are many reports and
verses which indicate that it is possible for them to en, yet there is
consensus of all our companions, except a few, that it is not possible
for the Imams to err."351 This is an admission on the part of alMajlisi that the consensus of the later Shia on the infallibility of the
Imams is contrary to their own reports. This is real life evidence and a
clear admission that they may all agree on misguidance, even though
there is no evidence for it in their own books.352
It seems that the idea of infallibility went through various
stages, and that the Shia initially differed in their beliefs and
definitions of infallibility. For example, during the era of Abu Ja'far
ibn Biibawayh (d. 381 AH) and his shaykh Muhammad ibn al-Hasan
al-Qummi, the opinion of most of the Shia was that the first level of

350

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

extremism was to deny forgetfulness on the part of the Prophet
(3g).353 In other words, they regarded anyone who said that the
Prophet ( a ) could not forget as being one of the extreme Shia.
Things changed after that, and denying that the Imam could be
absent-minded or could forget was equivalent to putting the Imams at
the level of Allah (&), the One whom neither slumber nor sleep
overtakes. Infallibility in that extreme form, denying that the Imams
could be absent-minded or forgetful, was the belief of an unknown
Shiite group in Kufah. In al-Bihrir, al-Majlisi says: "It was said to alRida - the eighth Imam of the Shia - that there were some people
in Kufah who claimed that the Prophet (g)
never forgot or made a
mistake in his prayer. He said: 'They are lying, may Allah (&) curse
them; the One who never forgets or makes a m i s a e is Allah (B),
besides Whom there is no other god."'354
This indicates that the belief that the Imam cannot m;&e a
mistake was the belief of an unspecified group of people and was
considered strange and odd. They said that the Prophet (g),
who was
the best of the Imams, could not make mistakes, but they did not say
that about their Imams. Then this belief expanded to include the
twelve Imams of the Shia, and the notion spread to all of the Irnami
Shia. The contemporary Shiite shaykh and 'Grand Ayatollah',
Abdullah al-Mamqzni, a f f m s that believing that the Imams cannot
make mistakes became one of the fundamentals of the Shiite madhhab.355He does not deny that their earlier shaykhs regarded that as
extreme, hut he says: "What was regarded as extreme in the past has
today become one of the fundamentals of the Shiite madh-hab."35hIf
this belief in the infallibility of the Imams means taking them to the
level of the Prophet, then believing that they cannot err is taking them
to the level of divinity, as was indicated by the eighth Imam of the
Shia, 'Ali a-Rida. Ibn Bibawayh al-Qummi and others stated that
this belief was the line that separates the extremists from others,357

'AEi ibn Abi Tilib

351

but their contemporary shay!&, al-Mamqini, thinks that believing
that the lmams cannot em is one of the fundamentals of the Shiite
madh-hah, and that the one who rejects the fundamentals is a
disbeliever. This view was also confirmed by their contemporary
shaykh, Mnlpin a l - ~ r n e e n . ~ ~ ~
What this means then is that their later scholars regarded their
earlier scholars as disbelievers, and vice versa. Al-Mamq2ni believes
that a fundamental belief of the Shiite madh-hab is that the Imams
cannot make mistakes, and some of them even say that there is
consensus on this point.'59 However, in some books that are
addressed to the ~ u n n i s , ~
we~ are
' told that the view of all the Shia is
that the Imams can make mistakes.361 Thus they denounce one
another as disbelievers and contradict one another, each one claiming
that what he says is the Shia view.962Belief in the infallibility of the
Imams was one of the reasons for belief in changes in the divine will
and taqiyyah - as we shall see below. This is because the real lives
of the Imams were not at all in harmony with the claims of
infallibility, so when differences or contradictions were found in their
statements, the Shia explained them by saying that this was due to a
change in the divine will or a case of taqiyyah, as some of the Shia
have admitted.363
One of the most serious academic implications of the claims of
infallibility is that they regard everything that was uttered by their
twelve Imams as having a status similar to the words of Allah (&)
and His Messenger (g).
Hence in their sources, most of the chains of
narration for the reports end at one of their Imams instead of going
back to the Messenger of Allah (g).
The Shia claim for their Imams
a level of infallibility that was not even achieved by the prophets and
messengers of AUah, as clearly indicated in the Qur'an, Sunnah and

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

3.2.1. Their evidence from the Noble Qur'an
for the infallibility of their Imams
Even though the Book of AUah makes no mention at all of the
twelve, as we have seen above, let alone their infallibility, the
Twelves Shia quote the Qur'an to support their belief in the
infallibility of their Imams. All their shaykhs agree on quoting as
evidence the verse: (And [remember] when the Lord of Ibraeem
[Abraham] [i.e., Allah] tried him with [certain] Commands, which he
fulfilled. He [Allah] said [to him], 'Verily, I am going to make you an
Imam [a leader] for mankind [to follow you].' [Ibdheem (Abraham)]
said, 'And of my offspring [to make leaders].' [Allah] said, 'My
Covenant [prophethood] includes not a i i l i m o o n [polytheists and
wrongdoers1.b (Qur'an 2: 124)
With this verse, al-Majlisi begins the chapter that he wrote in
al-Bihiir entitled: "The Necessity of the Imam's ~ n f a l l i b i l i t y . " ~ ~ ~
Many contemporary Shiite shaykhs regard this verse as their main
evidence from the Qur'an and do not quote any other verses to
establish this point. Two of them are M+sin a l - ~ m e e u ' and
~~
Muhammad Husayn h Khhif al-Gham', who says that this verse is
'clear evidence which proves the infallibility of the ~ r n a m s ' . ~ ~ ~
The author of Majrna' al-Bayin explained how his
companions found evidence in this verse for what they wanted, as he
said: "Our companions quoted this verse as evidence that the Imams
must inevitably be infallible and protected from bad deeds, because
Allah (&) stated that no evildoer can attain the Covenant, which is
imamate.368 Whoever is not infallible may be a wrongdoer who
transgresses either against himself or others. If someone suggests that
this verse confirms that no wrongdoer will attain the Covenant when
he is in the state of being a wrongdoer, but that if he repents he will
no longer be a wrongdoer, so it is possible for him to attain that
Covenant, the answer is that even if he repents, the verse still

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

353

excluded him when he was a wrongdoer. If it excluded him when he
was a wrongdoer, then it is decreed that he will never attain it. The
verse is general in meaning and is not limited to any particular time,
so it should be applied to alltimes. Thus no wrongdoer will attain that
status, even if he repents later on."369
Refutation of their interpretation of the verse
(a) The early generations differed concerning the meaning of the
word al- 'ahd (translated here as 'the Covenant'). Ibn 'Abhh and
as-Suddi said: "It refers to prophethood. Allah (B)
said, 'My
Covenant (prophethood) includes not limoon on (polytheists
and wrongdoers),' meaning prophethood." Muj2hid said: "It
refers to leadership, meaning 'I will not appoint a wrongdoer as a
leader whom others may follow."' Qatidah, Ihrilheem anNakha'i, 'Ala', al-Hasan and 'Ikrimah said: "The Covenant of
Allah (%) in the hereafter will not include the wrongdoers, hut
in this world, wrongdoers may attain it and thus he granted
security, food and sustenance." Az-Zajjgj said: "This is a good
opinion, meaning 'My safety and security are not granted to the
wrongdoers;' in other words, 'I will not grant them security from
My punishment.' What is meant by wrongdoer is the
polytheist." Ar-Rabee' ihn Anas and a&Dal&% said: "The
Covenant of Allah 1%) that is given to His slaves is His religion,
and He says the wrongdoers do not follow His religion. Do you
not see that He says: 4We blessed him and Ishiq [Isaac]. And of
their progeny are [some] that do right, and some that plainly
wrong themselves?# (Qur'an 37: 113) He says: Not all of your
descendants, 0 Ibriheem, will do right and follow the truth."
Ibn 'Ahhi% also said, concerning the words: "My Covenant
(prophethood) includes not wlimoon
(polytheists and
wrongdoers)," that "the wrongdoers have no Covenant, and
if you give them a covenant, then break it."370 As we can see,

354

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

the early generations differed as to the interpretation of this
verse, but according to the majority, it bas nothing to do with the
imamate or leadership at all. Those who did interpret it along the
lines of imamate (leadership) interpreted it as referring to
leadership in knowledge, righteousness and setting an example.
not imamate according to the R%c$i concept.371
@) Even if the verse was about imamate (rnlership), there is nothing

to indicate infallibility. It cannot be said that one who is not a
wrongdoer is thus infallible - that he never makes a mistake,
forgets anything, is absent-minded, or the like, as with the Shia
concept of infallibility. According to their view, the one who
forgets and the one who makes a mistake are both wrongdoers,
but no one agrees with them on that, and it is not in accordance
with the basic principles of Islam. It is quite clear that there is a
big difference between denying the attribute of wrongdoing and
affirming infallibility, because saying that someone is not a
wrongdoer is an affirmation of his good character, not of
infallibility in the Shiite sense.37z
(c) Their argument that the one who does wrong and then repents
from it is still described as a wrongdoer, and that repentance does
not help to take away this description of being a wrongdoer, is
not acceptable. The greatest of wrongdoing is polytheism, and
Allah (&) says: $It is those who believe [in the Oneness of Allah
and worship none but Him Alone] and confuse not their Belief
with @ulm [wrong, i.e. by worshipping others besides AUah]...)
(Qur'an 6: 82) He also explains what is meant by wrongdoing in
the verse: (Join not in worship others with Allah. Verily, joining
others in worship with Allah is a great m u l m [wrong] indeedb
(Qur'an 31: 13). Yet despite this, Allah says concerning the
disbelievers: $Say to those who have disbelieved, if they cease
[from disbelief], their past will be forgiven) (Qur'an 8: 38).

'Ali ibn Abi TtZib

355

But the implication of what these Shia say is that the one who
associates something else with Allah (%) even for a moment, or
commits a sin, even if it is a minor sin, is a wrongdoer who will
never be free of the attribute of wrongdoing. What this implies is
that the polytheist, even if he becomes Muslim, will still be a
polytheist, because wrongdoing is polytheism.373 Thus they
became even harsher than the Kharijites, because the Kharijites
do not confirm the warning of punishment to the one who
commits major sin unless he does not repent. It is well known on
the basis of common sense, let alone Sharia, custom and
linguistics that the one who disbelieves or does wrong and then
repents and becomes righteous can no longer be called a
disbeliever or wrongdoer. Otherwise it would be possible to call
an old man a boy, one who is awake a sleeper, one who is rich
poor, one who is full hungty, one who is dead alive, and vice
versa. Moreover, if that is applied in other situations, it means
that, for example, a person who swore that he would never greet
a disbeliever then greets a believer, who had been a disbeliever
many years ago, has broken his oath. However, no one says
that.?74
It is well known that a person who repents from wrongdoing
may be better than one who never did anything wrong. ~ s s e r t i n ~
that the person who never did an act of disbelief or killed or
sinned is better than anyone who believed after disbelieving, or
was guided after going astray, or repented after committing sin,
is going against what is well-established in Islam. It is well
known that the early generations were better than their children;
is there anyone with any sense who would compare the children
of the Muhijireen and An& with their fathers?375Moreover,
this conclusion would imply that all the Muslims - including
the Shia and Ahl alBayt, except those whom the Shia believe
are infaL1ible - are wrongdoers because they are not infallible.

356

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Their shaykh at-Toosi said that the word dhulm (wrongdoing)
implies something bad, so it cannot be applied to anyone except
one who deserves to be cursed, because Allah
says: 6No
doubt! the Curse of Allah is on the milimoon [polytheists,
wrongdoers, oppressors1.i) (Qur'an 11: 18)

(s)

(d) One of the Zaydi Shiite scholars stated, criticising the Twelver
interpretation of this verse: The Rxdis quote the verse as
evidence that the one who does wrong, even once, is not
deserving of the position of imamate (rulership), and they
wanted to undermine the caliphate of Abu Ba!a and 'Umar.
However, this is not correct because if the word al-'ahd (the
Covenant) is interpreted as refemng to prophethood, then there
is no evidence for them in the verse, but if it is interpreted as
refemng to imamate (rulership), then the one who repents from
wrongdoing can no longer be described as a wrongdoer, and thus
Allah (s)
will not exclude him from attaining the Covenant (al'ahd) except if he is a wrongdoer.376

3.2.2. The verse of purification
and the hadith of the cloak

(s)

The verse of purification is the verse in which Allah
says:
(Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs [evil deeds and sins] from you,
0 members of the family [of the Prophet], and to purify you with a
thorough purificationb (Qur'an 33: 33). As is well known, this is part
of the verse in which Allah ($) says: h d stay in your houses, and
do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance. And
perform As-Salrit (Iqrimat-as-Salit), and give Zakcit and obey Allah
and His Messenger. Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs [evil deeds
and sins] from you, 0 members of the family [of the Prophet], and to
purify you with a thorough
(Qur'an 33: 33)
The Twelver Shiite scholars deliberately took the verse of
purification out of its Qnr'anic context in which Allah (&) was

'Aliibn Abi Tcilib

357

addressing the wives of the Prophet (g),
because they wished to
exclude the wives of the Prophet. Then they added to that the hadith
of the cloak, which was narrated by Muslim in his Saheeh from the
Mother of the Believers 'kishah ( I & , ) . ~ ~
She
~ said: "The Prophet
(g)
went out one morning wearing striped cloak of black camel
hair. Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali came, and he enfolded him in the cloak, then
al-Hnsayn came and he enfolded him in it, then F2timah came and he
enfolded her in it, then 'Ali came and he enfolded him in it, then he
said: (Allah wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs [evil deeds and sins] from
you, 0 members of the family [of the Prophet], and to purify you
with a thorough
(Qur'an 33: 33)." They also added the
hadith of theMother of the Believers Umm Salamah (I$+,) refening to
when this verse was revealed to the Prophet (&). Umm Salamah
asked: "Am I included with them, 0 Prophet of Allah?" He said:
"You are still as yon are (one of Ah1 al-Bayt), and you are good," in
order to confirm the meaning that they wanted for this verse.378The
Twelver Shiite scholars think that in this verse there is evidence for
the infallibility of the people of the cloak, 'Ali,Fgtimah, al-Hasan
and al-Husayn, and that they are protected from sins, both major and
minor, and even from human error and forgetfulness.379

a

Their interpretation may be refuted in several ways:

The hadith of Umm Salamah quoted above was narrated in a
number of versions. It was narrated from Umm Salamah
that she
said: "TheProphet ( g ) was in my house, along with 'Ali,gztimah, alHasan and al-Husayn, and I made some khazeerah (a dish made with
ground meat and flour) for them. They ate and slept, and he covered
them with an 'abayah or blanket, then he said: '0Allah, these are the
people of my household, remove from them ar-rijs (evil deeds and
sins) and purify them with a thorough purification."' According to
another report, the Prophet ( g ) made them sit on a cloak, then he took

(ed)

358

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

hold of its four edges in his left hand and held it above their heads, and
he gestured with his right hand to his Lord and said: "These are the
people of my household, remove from them ar-rijs (evil deeds and
sins) and purify them with a thorough purification." These two
reports are in accordance with the report of Muslim from 'A'ishah
(&), that these five are included in the verse, but this does not
necessarily mean that others are not included.380
There are other reports from Umm Salamah (&)that contain
additional material indicating that she was not included with the
people of the cloak. Most of these reports have some weaknesses,
although some of them are sound, including the following report:
'When this verse was revealed to the Prophet (g):
BAllah wishes
only to remove Ar-Rijs [evil deeds and sins] from you, 0 members of
the family [of the Prophet], and to purify you with a thorough
pnrificationB (Qur'an 33: 33) in the house of Umm Salamah (%),he
called F2emah and al-Hasan and al-Husayn, and covered themwith a
clo* 'Ali was behind him and he covered him with a cloak, then he
said: '0 Allah, these are the people of my household, remove from
them ar-rijs (evil deeds and sins) and purify them with a thorough
purification.' Umm Salamah said: 'Am I included with them, 0
Prophet of Allah? He said: 'Yon are still as you are (one of Ah1 alBayt), and you are good."'381
There is a very impotrlant report, with a reliable chain of
narration, which indicates that Umm Salamah (I$&,) was included
under the cloak after the people of the cloak went out from under it.382
Perhaps the reason for that is that it would not have been proper to
include Umm Salamah with 'Ali ibn Abi T%ih (&) under one cloak,
so the Messenger of Allah (gg)took her under it after they had come
out. It was narrated that ~ h a said:
k "I heard Umm Salamah, the wife
of the Messenger of Allah (B),
when news came of the death of alNusayn ihn 'Ali. She cursed the people of Iraq and said: 'They have

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

359

killed him, may Allah kill them. They have deceived him and let him
down, may Allah curse them. I saw the Messenger of Allah (g)
when
F2timah came to him one moming with a pot in which she had made
some 'a~eedah
(a gruel made of flour with butter and honey) for him,
which she was canying on a tray of hers, and she put it down in front
of him. He said to her: "Where is your cousin (meaning 'Ali)?" She
said: "He is in the house." He said: "Go and call him, and bring me his
two sons." So she came with her two sons, holding each one by the
hand, and 'Mi was walking behind her, until they entered upon the
Messenger of Allah (g).
He seated the two children in his lap, and
'Ali sat on his right, and
sat on his left.' Umm Salamah said:
'He picked up a cloak from Khaybar that had been spread out on the
sleeping place in Madinah, and the Messenger of Allah
covered
them all with if then he took hold of the two edges of the girment in
his left hand, gestured with his right hand towards his Lord (&) and
said twice: "0 Allah, (these are) the people of my household, remove
from them ar-rijs (evil deeds and sins) and purify them with a
thorough purification." I said: "0Messenger of AUah, am I not part of
your family?" He said: "Of course, come under the cloak."' So she
went under the cloak after he finished his supplication for his cousin
'Ali and (Ali's) two sons and his daughter ~ i t i m a h . " ~ ~ ~

(s)

So the Messenger of Allah (g)
testified that Umm Salamah
(@) was part of his household, and he admitted her under thecloak

after he had offered supplication for them.384

Another indication that the verse does not refer to infallibility
or imamate (caliphate) is that the entire verse is addressed to the
wives of the Prophet (g);
it starts with them and ends with them.
Allah
says:

(s)

(0 Prophet [Muhammad]! Say to your wives: 'If you desire the life
of this world, and its glitter, then come! I will make a provision for

360

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

you and set you free in a handsome manner [divorce]. But if you
desire Allah and His Messenger, and the Home of the hereafter, then
verily, Allah has prepared for or-Muhsinit [good-doers] amongst
you an enormous reward.' 0 wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you
commits an open illegal sexual intercourse, the torment for her will
be doubled, and that is ever easy for Allah. And whosoever of you is
obedient to Allah and His Messenger (&), and does righteous good
deeds, We shall give her her reward twice over, and We have
prepared for her Rizq Karim [a noble provision -paradise]. 0 wives
of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your
duty [to Allah], then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a
disease [of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery] should be moved
with desire, but speak in an honourable manner. And stay in your
houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of
ignorance, And perform AS-SalZt [Iqhat-as-Salit], and give Zaka
and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah wishes only to remove ArRijs [evil deeds and sins] from you, 0 members of the family [of the
Prophet], and to purify you with a thorough purification. And
remember [0you the members of the Prophet's family, the Graces of
your Lord], that which is recited in your houses of the Verses of
Allah and Al-Hikmah [i.e. Prophet's Snnnah - legal ways, so give
your thanks to Allah and glorify His Praises for this Qur'an and the
Sunnah]. Verily, Allah is Ever Most Courteous, Wen-Acquainted
(Qur'an 33: 28-34)
with all things.)
It is addressed to all the wives of the Prophet (B).The
command, prohibition, promise and warning are for them, but as
there is benefit which may include them and other members of the
Prophet's household, the masculine pronoun [in the original Arabic]
is used with regard to the issue of purification, because if there are
both males and females, words appear in the masculine form. This is
the case here, since the purification issue includes all the members of
the household (Ah1 al-Bayt). 'Ali, Fitimah, al-Hasan and al-Husayn

'Aliibn Abi Trilib

361

(may Allah be pleased with them) are more entitled to that than
others, so the Prophet (g)
singled them out in his supplication for
them. Moreover, a man's wife is part of his household, so it is
common in Arabic for a man to say to his friend "Kayfa ahluka (how
is your family)?" meaning, "How are your wife and womenfok?"
The answer will be, "Hum bikhayr [They (using the masculine plural)
are fine]." AUah (g)
says: "They said: (Do you wonder at the
Decree of Allah? The Mercy of Allah and His Blessings be on yon, 0
the family [of Ibriiheem (Abraham)]) (Qur'an 11: 73). The person
addressed in this verse, according to scholarly consensus, is S k a h the
wife of Ibraeem (m).
This indicates that a man's wife is one of his
household.385
Allah (&) also says: (Then, when Moosa [Moses] had
fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his family, he saw a fire in
the direction of Tilr [Mount]. He said to his family: 'Wait, I have seen
a f i e ; perhaps I may bring to you from there some information, or a
burning firebrand that you may warm yourselves'%(Qur'an 28: 29).
The person addressed here is the wife of Moosa

(m).

Allah (&) says: (And mention in the Book [the Qur'an]
Ismri'eel [Ishmael]. Verily, he was true to what he promised, and he
was a Messenger, [and] a Prophet. And he used to enjoin on his
family and his people As-Sala [the prayers] and the Zakrit, and his
Lord was pleased with himb (Qur'an 19: 54-55). Who are his family
whom he used to enjoin to pray? This is like the verse in which Allah
(g)
says, addressing the Prophet
(And enjoin AS-Sala [the
prayer] on your family, and be patient in offering them [i.e. the Saliih
@rayers)].D (Qur'an 20: 132). Undoubtedly the word family here
includes his wives, or at least Khadeejah, as this soorah was revealed
in ~ a k k a h . ~ ' ~

(s):

Allah (%) says: (So they raced wrth one another to the door,
and she tore his shirt from the back. They both found her lord [i.e. her

362

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharfjites and Shia

husband] at the door. She said: 'What is the recompense
[punishment] for him who intended an evil design against your wife
[ahlika], except that he be put in prison or a painful torment?)
(Qur'an 12: 25) This refers to the ruler of Egypt. In the phrase, "What
is the recompense (punishment) for him who intended an evil design
against your wife [ahlika]," the word translated as wife here is ahl
(which is usually translated as 'family'). This is quite c ~ e a r . ~ ~ '

The idea of removing ar-rijs (evil deeds and sins) does not, in
either the Arabic language or the language of the Qur'an, imply
infallibility at all. Ar-R2ghib al-Isfah2ni said in Mufradrit Alf& alQur'an, under the heading rajasa: "The word ar-rijs refers to
something dirty, so it may be said rajul rajsi (a dirty man) or rij6l
arj& (dnty men). Allah (&) says: (...are an abomination [rijs] of
Satan's handiwork) (Qur'an 5: 90). From the point of view of Sbaria,
rijs refers to alcohol and gambling. The disbelievers are regarded as
rijs because believing in polytheism is the most abhorrent of all
things. Allah ( B )says: (But as for those in whose hearts is a disease
[of doubt, disbelief and hypocrisy], it will add suspicion and doubt
[rijsan] to their suspicion, disbelief and doubt [ila rijsihim]) (Qur'an
9: 125). Allah also says: (And He will put the wrath [al-rijs] on those
who are heedless.) (Qur'an 10: 100). It was said that ar-rijs means
stench, or torment, as in the verses @erily, the Mushrikoon
[polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah,
and in the Message of Muhammad] are Najasun [impure]) (Qur'an 9:
28) and (or the flesh of swine [pork]; for that surely, is impure [rijslb
(Qur'an 6: 145). To sum up, the basic meaning of the word rijs is dirt
or filth, and it is used to refer to polytheism, as in the verse, (So shun
the abomination [rijs] [worshipping] of idols, and shun lying speech
[false statements1.b (Qur'an 22: 30). The word is also used to refer to
h a r k and evil things, such as food and drink, as in the verses: (Say

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

363

[O Muhammad]: 'I find not in that which has been revealed to me
anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it
be Mayfah [a dead animal] or blood poured forth [by slaughtering or
the like], or the flesh of swine [pork]; for that surely, is impure or
impious [unlawful] meat...') (Qur'an 6: 145) and (Intoxicants [all
kinds of alcoholic drinks], and gambling, and Al-AnsLib [stone altars
for sacrifices to idols, etc.], and Al-AzlZm [arrows for seeking luck or
decision] are an abomination [rijs] of ShaytLin's [Satan's]
handiwork$ (Qur'an 5: 90). There is no proof that the Qur'an uses the
word rijs to refer to sin in a general sense, such that removing rijs
would imply infallibility."388

Purification from rijs is not an affirmation of infallibility for
anyone. Just as the word rijs does not refer to a man's sins or errors in
ijtihid ((reasoning and deriving rulings) and instead refers to dirt,
stench and impurities -both tangible and intangible, so too the word
purification does not imply infallibility. Allah (&)wants to purify all
the believers, not just the members of the Prophet's household, even
though Ah1 al-Bayt are the most entitled and most deserving of
purification among people. Allah (&) says in His Book about the
Companionsof the Messenger of Allah (@): (Allah does not want to
place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you, and to complete
His Favour to you$ (Qur'an 5: 6).
Allah (%) also says: (Take Sadaqah [alms1 from their wealth
in order to purify them and sanctify them with itB (Qur'an 9: 103).
QTruly,Allah loves those who turn unto Him in repentance and loves
those who purify themselves.)
(Qur'an 2: 222)
Just as Allah (s)
tells us that He wants to purify the members
of the Prophet's household (Ah1 al-Bayt), He also tells us that He
wants to purify the believers. If the fact that Allah (&) wants to

364

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

purify them meant infallibility, then that would have happened to the
Companions and to all the believers, because of the verses stating that
Allah (g)
wanted to purify them. Allah (&) says of the Companions
who frequented the mosque of Qub2: (In it are men who love to
clean and to purify themselves. And Allah loves those who make
themselves clean and pure) (Qur'an 9: 108). However, these people
were not infallible or protected from sin, according to consensus.

(s)

Allah
also says of the people of Badr, of whom there were
three hundred and t w e e n men: 4And He caused water [rain] to
descend on yon from the sky, to clean you thereby and to remove
from you the Rijz [whispering, evil suggestions] of Shaytcin [satan].)
(Qur'an 8: 11). This is not an affirmation of their infallibility.
Moreover, there is no difference in wording between this verse and
the verse in which Allah (&) says of Ah1 al-Bayt: (to remove Ar-Rijs
[evil deeds and sins] f ~ o myou, 0 members of the family [of the
Prophet], and to purify you with a thorough purification), (Qur'an 33:
33). The words rijz and rijs are very close in meaning, and the
purification mentioned in both verses is the same. It is whims and
desires that made the second verse, and not the first, evidence for
infallibility.
What is strange is that the Shiite scholars adhere to the verse
and apply it to the people of the cloak, then interpret Allah's wanting
to purify them as confuming the infallibility of the people of the
cloak, yet at the same time they deliberately forget the verses in
which Allah
speaks of wanting to purify the Companions. On
the contrw, they take the opposite view and criticise the
Companions, accusing them of turning back on their heels, even
though Allah (&) stated that He wanted to purify them, according to
the verse: (And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him
there is no light.) (Qur'alz 24: 40).389

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

365

3.2.2.e.
The divine will referred to in the verse is His legislative will,
which is different from His universal decree. In other words, it
means: AUah
loves to remove ar-rijs (evil deeds and sins) from
you. The Sunni scholars have discussed the two aspects of the divine
will - the religious, legislative will and the universal, foreordaining
will - and they said:

(s)

(s)

"The religious, legislative will includes that which Allah
loves and approves of, as in the verses where AUah (&) says: (Allah
intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult
for you.) (Qur'an 2: 185) and BAllah wishes to accept your
repentance, but those who follow their lusts, wish that you [believers]
should deviate tremendously away [from the Right Path]. Allah
wishes to lighten [the burden] for you; and man was created weak)
(Qur'an 4: 27-28).

"The universal, foreordaining will is that which encompasses
all of His creation, as in the verses where Allah
says: 4But AUah
does what He likes$ (Qur'an 2: 253) and 4And my advice will not
profit you, even if I wish to give you good counsel, if Allah's Will is
to keep you astray$ (Qur'an 11: 34).

(a)

"Sin comes under the heading of the universal, foreordaining
will. AUah b+&) does not love, approve of or enjoin sin; rather He
despises it, hates it and forbids it. This is the view of all the early
generations and the imams (leading scholars); they differentiated
between the divine will, which encompasses that which He loves and
is pleased with, and the universal, foreordaining divine will and
decree, which does not necessarily include that which He loves and
approves of."390
Undoubtedly Allah (&) removed ar-rijs from Fshmah, alHasan, al-Husayn, 'Ali and the wives of the Prophet (may Allah be

366

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

pleased with them all), but the divine will referred to in this verse is
the legislative will. Hence it says in the hadith that when the Prophet
(g)
wrapped them in the cloak, he said: "0 Allah, these are the
people of my household, remove from them ~ r - r i j s . " ~ ~ '

3.2.2.f.
The supplication of the Prophet (&J settles the matter. If there
was any indication in the verse of purification that purification of the
people of the cloak had already taken place, the Messenger of Allah
(B)
would not have covered them with the cloak and prayed for them
by saying, "0 Allah, these are the people of my household, remove
from them ~ r - r i j s . " ~ ~This
'
is clear evidence that the verse was
revealed concerning the wives of the Prophet (g),
and the
Messenger of AUah (&) wanted the people of the cloak to be
included in this divine revelation of purification, so he gathered them
and covered them with the cloak and prayed for them, and Allah (&)
accepted his supplication for them393and purified them as He
purified the wives of the Prophet, as indicated by the text of the verse.

3.2.2.g.
Among the refutations proving that the verse does not indicate
imamate and infallibility is the fact that what they claim as being
unique to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali, a w a s a n and al-Husayn (may
AUah be pleased with them) on the basis of this verse would also
apply to Fstimah (I&).
However, the position of leadership cannot be
.,
proven for women. If this is evidence that those who are included in
the verse are infallible and deserve to be leaders, then Fztimah (%)
would be like that too, in the same (true) sense. This indicates that the
verse is not speaking about imamate or infallibility. Another point is
the fact that nine of their Imams are not referred to in this verse,
because it refers to three of the twelve only.394

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

367

3.2.3. Their evidence from their own reports
The Twelvers base their beliefs in infallibility and other
matters on the reports narrated by the author of al-Krfi, Ibr2heem alQummi, al-Majlisi and others of their kind. The reports that affirm
this so-called infallibility for the twelve Imams are strange both in
their texts and their chains of narration.
In his book about the infallibility of their Imams, al-Majlisi
quoted twenty-three reports from his shaykhs such as al-Qurnmi, al'Ayyishi, al-Mufeed and others, after quoting this verse as evidence:
(And [remember] when the Lord of Ibr2heem [Abraham] [i.e., Allah]
tried him with [certain] Commands, which he fulfilled. He [Allah]
said [to him], 'Verily, I am going to make you an Imam [a leader] for
mankind [to follow you].' [Ibr2heem (Abraham)] said, 'And of my
offspring [to make leaders].' [Allah] said, 'My Covenant
[prophethood] includes not @2limoorz [polytheists and
wrongdoersl'b (Qur'an 2: 124).
This shows that their interpretation of the verse to prove their
point is false. In al-Kzfi, al-Knlayni wrote a number of chapters about
this so-called infallibility, in which he quoted reports with chains of
narration from the twelve Imams, claiming that they were infallible
and even partners in prophethood; they even claimed to have some
divine attributes. You will find some examples of that in al-Kdfi, in
the chapter on their beliefs in the basic principles of faith. In the
chapter entitled, "The Imams are the pillars of the earth," there are
three reports which say that the twelve Imams are like the Messenger
of Allah (&) in that they must be obeyed; they are like the Prophet
(g)
in virtue and with regard to the duties that they were given, and
obedience was due to 'Ali (&) after the Messenger of Allah (g)
as
it was due to the Messenger of Allah (@).395
Soon after that, the author raises 'Ali to a status higher than
that of the Messenger of Allah (@), to the status of the Lord of the

368

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Worlds, when he says that 'Ali said: "I have been given attributes that
were not given to anyone before me. I have been given knowledge of
death and calamities, so I did not miss knowledge of what came
before me, and knowledge of what is in tbe future is not withheld
from me."396 In reality, the only One who has knowledge of death
and calamities is Allah (B):
$No person knows what he will earn
tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die), (Qur'an 31:
34). Nothing escapes His knowledge, for He is the Creator (&).
Allah (&) says: 4N0t even the weight of an atom [or a small ant] or
less than that or greater escapes His Knowledge in the heavens or in
the earth), (Qur'an 34: 3). The one who studies the chapter of al-K6ji
on this topic will note that it includes claims similar to those of false
prophets and heretics throughout history; the only difference is that
they attributed these fabrications to a number of the members of Ah1
a l - ~ a ~ t . ~ ~ ~

3.2.4. Their rational evidence for infallibility
They say that it is essential for the Ummah to have an infallible
leader to correct its mistakes because if it were possible for him to
make mistakes, then he would need someone else to correct him, and
thus there would be an endless chain... so there must be a leader who
is infallible. This is because their reliance is on the leader (the Imam)
and not on the Ummah. They say that he is the protector of Sharia,
that there can be no reliance on the Qur'an, Snnnah or scholarly
consensus without him,and so on.398
As a matter of fact, the exact opposite is true. The Ummah is
protected from error (infallible) by means of the Book of its Lord and
the Sunnah of its Prophet (g),
for the Ummah cannot be united on
misguidance. The infallibility of the Ummah means that there is no
need for the ruler (the Imam) to be infallible himself. This was stated
by the scholars with regard to the wisdom behind the infallibility of

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

369

the Ummah; they said: 'When the nations before us changed their
religion, Allah sent a Prophet to show them the truth. But there is no
Prophet after the Prophet of this Ummah; therefore its infallibility
takes the place of prophethood. If anyone tries to alter the religion,
Allah will enable and inspire someone to explain the error of his
ways. Hence Allah mentioned the way of the believers alongside
obedience to His Prophet when He
said: #And whoever
contradicts and opposes the Messenger [Muhammad] after the right
path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the
believers' way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and
bum him in hell -what an evil destination!8 (Qur'an 4: 115).So the
infallibility of the Ummah and its protection against misguidance, as
mentioned in the Islamic texts, is completely different from the idea
that one of the Muslims must be infallible and that it is possible for
the entire Muslim community to fall into error if there is no infallible
leader among them."399

(s)

All the words that they wrote, filling many pages with their
rational evidence to confirm the need for an infallible Imam, are
fulfilled in the Messenger (&). Hence in the case of a dispute, the
Ummah refers to what the Messenger brought, namely the Qur'an
and Sunnah, they do not refer to the ruler (the Imam). @i[And] if you
differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to AUah and His
Messenger) (Qur'an 4: 59). The scholars said that this means: "Refer
to the Book of Allah and to His Prophet (&), and after he dies, refer
to his ~unnah."~"With the guidance provided by the Qur'an and
Sunnah, the Ummah cannot unite on misguidance, because it will
never be without those who adhere to both, until the Hour begins.
Hence proof was established for the Ummah by means of the
Messengers. Allah (,gy;i) says:
#Verily, We have sent the Revelation to you [0Muhammad] as We
sent the Revelation to Nooh moah] and the Prophets after him; We

370

'Ali'sattitude towards the Khartjites and Shia

[also] sent the Revelation to Ibriheem [Abraham], Ismi'eel [Ishmael],
Ishiq [Isaac], Ya'qoob [Jacob], and Al-Asbit [the offspring of the
twelve sons of Ya'qoob (Jacob)], 'Eesa [Jesus], Ayyoob [Job],
Yoonus [Jonah], Hiroon [Aaron], and Sulaymib [Solomon]; and to
D2wood [David] We gave the Zahoor [Psalmsl. And Messengers We
have mentioned to you before, and Messengers We have not
mentioned to you, - and to Moosa [Moses] Allah spoke directly.
Messengers as bearers of good news as well as of warning in order
that mankind should have no plea against Allah after the [coming ofl
Messengers.)
(Qur'an 4: 163-165)

(s)

Allah
did not add "and the Imams". This proves false the
view of those who believe that people need someone other than the
Messengers, such as the ~ m a m s . ~ ~ ~
Their claim of infallibility has no proof except for their
suggestion that Allah ( B )will never leave the world devoid of
infallible Imams, because of the interests and mercy to he found in
that. But it is well known that no interest or mercy has been achieved
by this supposed absent, awaited Imam; the same is true of his
grandfathers who preceded him. No interest or mercy was achieved
by any infallible Imam as was achieved after the Hijrah by the
Prophet
He was the leader of the believers, whom they had to
obey and-through whom they achieved happiness. After he died,
authority was not acquired by anyone whom they can claim was
infallible except 'Ali (&). It is also known that the interests and
mercy enjoyed by the believers at the time of the three previous
caliphs were greater and better than those during 'Ali's caliphate,
which was a time of killing, turmoil and d i v i ~ i o n . ~ '

(s).

With regard to the other Imams, who are lower than 'Ali (&)
in status, people could acquire from their knowledge and examples
what they could acquire from others like them. 'Ali ihn al-Husayn
and his son Abu Ja'far, and the two sons of Ja'far ihn Muhammad,

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

371

taught peopIe that which Allah (&)taught them, in the same manner
as other imams of their time. During their eras, there were other
scholars who were more knowledgeable and more beneficial than
them, and this is well known among the scholars. Even if they were
more knowledgeable and more religiously committed, people of
knowledge and religious commitment could not achieve what could
be achieved by people in positions of power and authority, who were
able to oblige the people to adhere to the truth and prevent them from
indulging in falsehood. The Imams after these three, such as the two
al-'Askaris, did not show great knowledge from which the U r n a h
could benefit, and they did not perform any actions from which the
Ummah could benefit. They were just like other members of Banu
Hiishim who had a certain sanctity and status, and they had enough
knowledge about Islam to fulfil their religious duties, which is
knowledge that many ordinary Muslims also had; that should he
expected of people like them. Hence the scholars did not take from
them as they had taken from the first three.40"

3.2.5. General discussion of the idea
of infallibility of the Imams
The claim of infallibility of the Imams is similar to giving them
a share of prophethood. The infallible one must be followed in all that
he says, and it is not permissible to go against him in any way. This is
something that is only for the Prophets, hence we are enjoined to
believe in what was revealed to them. Allah (@) says: aSay [O
Muslims]: We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down to
us and that which has been sent down to Ibr&eem [Abraham],
Ismii'eel [Ishmael], Ishi? [Isaac], Ya'qoob [Jacob], and to Al-Asbiit
[the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya'qoob (Jacob)], and that which
has been given to Moosa [Moses] and 'Eesa [Jesus], and that which
has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no

372

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted [in
Islam]% (Qur'an 2: 136).
We are directed to say: "We believe in what was given to the
Prophets." Belief in what the Prophets brought is one of the tenets
that we are obliged to say and believe in; this is something on which
there is consensus among the Muslims. The one who regards anyone
after the F'rophet as infallible in all that he says has given him the
status of prophethood, even if he does not call him
This is
contrary to the religion of Islam; it is contrary to the Qur'an, the
Sunnah and the consensus of the early generations and leading
scholars of the Ummah.
With regard to the Qur'an, AUah says: 40 you who believe!
Obey Allah and obey the Messenger [Muhammad], and those of you
[Muslims] who are in authority. [And] if you differ in anything
amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger) (Qur'an 4:
59). He commands us, in the case of a dispute, to refer only to Allah
(&) and the Messenger. If the people had any figure who was
infallible, apart from the Messenger (g),
Allah would have enjoined
us to refer to him, so the Qur'an indicates that there is no infallible
figure after the Messenger (g).405
~ l l a h(&) says:
#And whoso obey Allah and the Messenger [Muhammad], then they
will be in the company of those on whom Allah has bestowed His
Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddeeqoon [those followers of the
Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abn
Bakr as-Siddeeq], the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent
these companions are!)
(Qur'an 4: 69)
dAnd whosoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then verily, for
him is the fire of hell, he shall dwell therein forever.) (Qur'an 72: 23)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

373

So the Qur'an, in more than one place, indicates that the one
who obeys the Messenger is one of the blessed, and it is not stipulated
that he obey any other infallible figure. In the same way, the one who
disobeys the Messenger is one of the doomed, even if he obeys one
whom he thinks is infallible. The scholars are unanimously agreed
that the words of every person may be accepted or rejected except the
Messenger of AUah (g).
He must be believed in everything he says
and followed in everything he commands. His prohibitions must be
heeded, and AUah should only be worshipped in the ways he
prescribes. He is the one who is infallible, and he does not speak of
@ns own) desire; it is only a revelation revealed.406
The Sunnah also indicates this, but the Shia only refer to the
words of their Imams.Below are some words of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&),
. .. which prove that their understanding is flawed.
There are reports narrated in Nahj al-Balighah, a book in
which the Shia believe, which demolish all that they have built of
claims that the Imams are infallible. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&>)
says, according to what is narrated by the author of Nahj alBalighah: "Do not try to flatter me, do not think that I would be upset
when you tell me the truth and do not think that I want to be above
people, for if a person finds truth burdensome when it is told to him
or finds justice burdensome when it is discussed with him, he will
find acting upon them to be even more burdensome. So do not refrain
from speaking the truth or advising me to be fair and just, for I myself
am not above making mistakes and am not safe from e r r ~ r . " ~Here
'
he does not claim what the Shia claim for him, that he does not make
mistakes; on the contrary, he confums that he is not safe from error.
Similarly, he does not say that he has no need of people's advice;
rather he seeks advice on the basis of truth and justice, because the
Ummah cannot unite on misguidance, but each individual on his own
is vulnerable to misguidance. Thus we know that the claim of
infallibility comes from the extreme ~ h i a . ~ "

374

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

It also says in Nahj al-Balighah: 'The people have no choice
but to have a leader, whether he is righteous or a wrongdoer, under
whose leadership the believer will strive and under whose authority
the fay' will be collected, the enemy will be fought, the roads will be
kept safe and the weak will be supported against the strong."409 We
can see that infallibility is not stipulated for the ruler and is not
referred to at all. He thought that it was essential to appoint a leader to
serve the interests of the people and the countq, but he did not say
that no one should be in charge of the people's affairs except an
infallible Imam, or that every banner that is raised other than the
banner of the infallible one is a banner of ignorance, as the books of
the Shia say. He did not limit rulership to the twelve who are
regarded as infallible by the Shia, or regard as disbelievers those who
take positions of leadership, such as the caliphs of the Muslims - as
is the view of the Shia. He thought that it was essential for there to be
a ruler, even if he is a wrongdoer, and he regarded his leadership as
legitimate. He considered it permissible to engage in jihad under the
leadership of a bad ruler. What does this have to do with what the
Shia believe -that jihad is not permissible until the Awaited one4''
emerges, because legitimate mlership is limited to the twelve Imams?
The Imams admitted their sins and asked Allah for forgiveness
for them. According to Nalzj al-Bakighah, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) said in his supplication: "0 Allah, forgive me for what You
know better than I, and if I repeat it, then forgive me again. 0 Allah,
forgive me for what I have promised but which You did not find
fulfilled with me. 0 Allah, forgive me for what I said for the purpose
of drawing close to You but which was different from what was in
my heart. 0 Allah, forgive me for brief glances, saying what I did not
mean, desires of the heart and slips of the tongue."4" We can see this
admission of sin and of returning to it after repentance, this admission
of saying what is not meant and desires of the heart. All of that is
contrary to what the Shia claim of infallibility, because if 'Ali and the

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

375

Imams were infallible, then seeking repentance for their sins would
be in vain. The books of the Shia narrate that each of their Imams
sought forgiveness from Allah for sins and errors, but if they were
infallible, they would not have any sin.412The Shiite shaykhs did not
know how to interpret such supplications, which are contrary to their
belief in infallibility.413
There is another matter from the books of the Shia themselves
that shows the claim of infallibility to be false: differences and
contradictions in their views on various issues. The actions of those
who are infallible should not be contradictory; they should confirm
and support one another. Differences of opinion are contrary to the
concept of infallibility, and infallibility is a condition of imamate in
their view; hence they contradict the principle of imamate itself. The
fact that there are differences and contradictions in the actions of the
Imams was a direct cause of many people leaving Shiism, because
they were confused about this contradiction. For example, al-Qummi
and an-Nawbakhti mentioned that after the killing of al-Hnsayn, a
number of his co~npaniouswere confused and said: "We see a
contradiction between the actions of al-Hasan and the actions of alHusayn (45). Lf what al-Hasan did - making peace with
Mu'iiwiyah and giving up his leadership to him because he was
unable to fight him, despite the large number and strength of his
supporters - was right, correct and essential, then what al-Husayn
did - fighting Yazeed ibn Mn'Zwiyah, despite the small numbers
and weakness of his suppoaers and the large number of Yazeed's
supporters, until he and all his companions were killed - was an
invalid action that was not essential. Al-Hnsayn had a greater excuse
to refrain from fighting Yazeed and to seek a peace deal than alHasan had to refrain from fighting Mu'iiwiyah. If what al-Husayn did
by fighting Yazeed until he and his children and companions were
killed, was right, correct and essential, then al-Hasan's giving up the

376

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shia

fight against Mu'%wiyah, despite the large numbers that he had with
him, was wrong." They had doubts about the validity of the
leadership of both, so they recanted and joined the common folk.414
As for examples of differences and contradictions in the
opinions of the Imams, there are many of them, and this was another
reason why some of the Shia gave up Shiism. One of the prominent
Shiite scholars, at-Dosi, testified to that and said that the reports
narrated from them contradicted and differed from one another to
such an extent that you cannot fmd any report without finding
another that conflicts with it. This is regarded as one of the greatest
flaws of the Shiite madh-hab and as one of the reasons why some of
the Imami Shia left the madh-hab. The books at-Tahdheeb and alIstib~&r,
which are two of the four main reference books of the Shia,
bear witness to this contradiction in many of their reports.
A!-Toosi tried to reconcile these differences and deal with
these contradictions by interpreting some of the reports as being an
example of taqiyyah, but he only succeeded in making matters worse,
as at-Toosi is the one who was deciding which of these reports were
and were not examples of taqiyyah and hence which reports were to
be acted upon and which were not. FVhat is agreed upon is that atToosi himself was not infallible and would inevitably make mistakes
in his decision on some of these reports. He may have regarded some
things that were not taqiyyah as being taqiyyah, and the Shia
followed him in his verdicts. It is clear that in their religious affairs,
the Shia are following people like at-Toosi, and they are not
following one who is infallible.
The Riififidi Shia came up with their beliefs in taqiyyah and
changes in the divine will, which we will discuss below, as a means
of explaining these differences in the reports and actions of the
Imams. Some of the Shia discovered these attempts and found out the
reason for the fabrication of these two doctrines, so they left Shiism

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

377

and said: The Rzfifidi Imams invented two doctrines for their
followers whereby they will never notice any of the lies of their
Imams, namely the idea of changes in the divine will and the
permissibility of taqiyyah.
There is another matter which shows the claim of infallibility
to be false, which is that the infallible one whom they supposedly
follow could not protect them from developing differences with
regard to the foundation of their religion, namely the imamate. We
find that they differ, forsake one another, curse one another and
regard each other as disbelievers due to their differences with regard
to the number and identities of their Imams and the question of
whether to await the return of the h a m or to go ahead and choose
another Imam. This is in addition to the various contradictory reports
that discuss many religious issues, both basic and minor. The socalled infallibility did not prevent the Shia from differing among
themselves, and the fact that the concept of infallibility did not
benefit them indicates that it does not exist at all. It could be said that
their belief in the infallibility of the Imams is irrelevant today
anyway, since the line of the Imams effectively came to an end in 260
AH, and there is nothing left but to wait for the promised 'absent
Imam'. However, this belief has an impact on the lives of the Shia
today in several ways:

1. They follow the reports narrated from the twelve Imams in
the same way that other Muslims follow the Qur'an and
Sunnah.
2. They exaggerate about the graves and tombs of the Imams,
and they exaggerate about their infallibility. This reached
the extent of ascribing divine attributes to them and turned
into such exaggeration about their graves and shrines that
they circumambulate them and call upon their occupants
instead of upon Allah

(s).

378

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

3. The Shiite scholars are given some of these attributes (of
infallibility), so they think that the one who rejects what
the scholar says is like the one who rejects what Allah
says. This is a very serious matter that is like associating
partners with AUah (B).

(s)

4. They believe in this c o m p t belief that has nothing to do
with Amir d-Mu'mineeu 'Ali and his sons and grandsons
(may Allah he pleased with them).415

3.3. Appointment by name is one of the
conditions of imamate according
to the Twelver Imami Shia
The R Z d i Shia believe that imamate is like prophethood and
can only be by divine instruction on the lips of Allah's Messenger
(B).They believe that imamate, like prophethood, is a mercy from
Allah, and that no era should be without an Imam, to whom
obedience is obligatory and who is appointed by Allah (g).
The
people do not have the right to choose and appoint the Imam, and the
Imam does not have the right to appoint his successor. They
fabricated and attributed to their Imams dozens of reports conce~ning
this, including the reports attributed to Imam Muhammad d-Iliqir
(may Allah have mercy on him), in which he is supposed to have
said: "Do you think that this matter is up to us to decide as we wish?
No, by Allah, it is a covenant from the Messenger of Allah, in which
man after man is named until the last man."416
The Twelver Shia believe that the Messenger (g)
spoke of
and mentioned by name the Imams who were to come after him, and
that there are twelve Imams, no more and no less. Their names are:

1. 'Ali ihn Abi T%b (d. 40 AH)
2. Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (&) az-Zakiy (d. 50 AH)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

379

3. Al-Husayn ibn 'Ali (&I,
the leader of the martyrs (d. 61 AH)
4. 'Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'Abideen (d. 95 AH)
5. Muhammad ibn 'Ali al-B@ir (d. 114 AH)
6. Ja'far ibn Muhammad a$-S&Iiq (d. 148 AH)
7. Moosa ibn Ja'far al-KZd&im (d. 183 AH)
8. 'Ali ibn Moosa ar-Rida (d. 203 AH)
9. Muhammad ibn 'Ali alJawid (d. 220 AH)
10. 'Ali ibn Muhammad al-H2di (d. 254 AH)
I I. Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Mahdi (d. 256 AH)
12. Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-'Askari (d. 260 AH)
According to Ibn Saba', the appointment of rightful heirs
stopped at 'Ali (&), but those who came later included a number of
his descendants in this concept. The Shiite cells were working quietly
and secretly, but nevertheless these claims reached some members of
Ah1 al-Bayt, and they denied them categorically, as their forefather
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)had done. Hence those liars fabricated
the concept of taqiyyah, which they falsely ascribed to Ah1 al-Bayt,
so that it would be easy for them to spread their ideas, making sure
that their followers would not be affected by the sincere public
statements of Ah1 al-Bayt to the people.417
One of the most serious matters fabricated by the Shia is the
idea of the rightfully appointed heir. This means that the Messenger
of Allah (g)
instructed the people that after his death, the caliphate
should go directly to 'Ali (&,), and it means that those who came
before him usurped his rights. It says in the book al-K6ji that those
who died without knowing their Imam died a death like those during
the time of pre-Islamic ignorance. 'Ali was the rightful heir of the
Prophet (B),
according to their claim.418 However, in studying the
history of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, we find no mention of
rightfnlly appointed heirs during the caliphates of Abu Bakr and
Jmar (&5). This idea began to emerge during the last years of the

380

X i ' s attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

caliphate of 'Uthmsn (&), when fimah began to appear. The
Companions rejected tbis idea when they heard it and explained that
it was false; among the most famous of those who did so were 'Ali
ibn Abi T2ib (&) and the Mother of the Believers 'A'ishah (I&).
During the caliphate of 'Ali (&), we see this idea crystallising i n k e
form of a belief to which people were called and which was
propagated. This notion of the so-called rightfully appointed heir,
which is promoted by the RiEfidis and continned by their scholars,
wav the fabrication of Ahdullah ibn Saba', as was mentioned by anNawbakhti and al-Kashshi and as we have seen above. What is
narrated in sound reports from a number of the Companions,
including 'Ali (&) himself, is sufficient to refute their claim. There
is a great deal of such evidence, including the following:

It was said in the presence of 'kishah (r&) that the Prophet
(G)
appointed 'Ali by name as his successor, and she said: "Who
said that? I saw the Prophet ( g ) as he was leaning on my chest. He
called for a vessel of water, then he fell to one side and died, without
me realising. So how could he have issued instructions that 'Ali
should be his s n ~ c e s s o r ? " ~ ' ~
This clear statement from 'A;l'ishah(I&) that the Prophet ( g )
did not appoint 'Ali by name as his successor is the greatest evidence
that there was no appointed heir. The Prophet (g)
died in her lap, so
if there had been any instruction, she would have been the most
aware of it of all people.420

It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbk (4)
said: " 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib
(&)came out of the house of the Messenger of Allah (g)
during the
illness from which he died, and the people said: '0 Abu al-Hasan,

how is the Messenger of Allah (g)
this morning?' He said: 'He is
better this morning, praise be to AUah.' 'Abb% ibn 'Abdul-Muwb
took his hand and said to him: 'By AUah, after three days you will be
driven by the stick (you will be under the authority of someone else).
By Allah, I think that the Messenger of Allah ( g J will die of this
sickness, for I know how the faces of Banu 'Abdul-Mumlib look
when they are dying. Let us go to the Messenger of Allah and ask him
who is to be in charge. If we are to be in charge, then we will know it;
if someone else is to be in charge, then we will know it, and he will
advise him to be kind to us.' 'Ali said: 'By Allah, if we ask the
Messenger of AUah (g)
for it (leadership), and he denies it to us, the
people will never give it to us after that and, by Allah, I will never ask
the Messenger of AUah (@J for it."'421
In these words, there is evidence of the extent of the
Companions' commitment to carrying out the instrnctions of the
Messenger of Allah (g).
If there had been any appointed successor,
no one would have gone against it, and the An@ would not have
expressed their opinions so freely, bravely and honestly when they
met, after the Prophet (g)
died, to discuss a successor, saying: "A
d e r from among us and a ruler from among
They would
have sworn allegiance to the one whom the Prophet (g)
had
instructed should be his successor, or at least some of them would
have mentioned these instructions. If there had been some instruction
to that effect before this, 'Aliwould have said to al-'Abbb: "How
can we ask him who will be his successor when he has already
appointed me as his snccessor?" The Messenger of Allah (@J died
the same day, and as there were no instrnctions of that nature, it
becomes clear that the contention that 'Ali (&) had clear
instructions is a claim that has no sound basis. All the reports that
they narrate, referring to the instructions that Ali (&) should be the
successor, are to be rejected because they are contrary to this clear
statement from 'Ali (&) himself. All the texts that they quote as

evidence either do not refer to the man concerned ('Ali) or they do
refer to him, but they are fabricated.4z3

'Ali (&) was asked: "Did the Messenger of Allah (@) tell
you anything that was for you only?' He said: "The Messenger of
Allah ( g ) did not tell us anything that was for us only, that he did not
tell all the people, except that which is in this sheath of my sword."
He took out a document on which was written: "May Allah curse the
one who offers a sacrifice to anything other than Allah, may Allah
curse the one who steals the boundary markers, may Allah curse the
one who curses his parents, and may Allah curse the one who gives
refuge to an innovator."424
Ihn Katheer (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "This
hadith, which is proven in Bukhari and Muslim and elsewhere from
'Ali(&), refutes the R X d i claim that the Messenger of Allah (&)
gave instructions that 'Ali should be his successor. If the matter was
as they claim, none of the Companions would have rejected that
(instruction of the Prophet). They were too obedient towards Allah
(&) and His Messenger, during his lifetime and after his death, to
reject his instructions and give precedence to someone other than the
one to whom he gave precedence and to reject someone to whom the
Messenger of Allah ( g ) had given precedence in his instructions.
They are far above doing any such thing. The one who thinks that the
Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) could do that is
accusing them all of comption and of agreeing to go against the
wishes of the Messenger (B)and against his ruling and instructions.
Any person who goes so far in doing evil has gone beyond the pale of
Islam and has become a disbeliever, according to the consensus of
the prominent scholars."425An-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on
him) said: "This disproves the claim made by the lmami and Rzfidi

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Their aim was to slander the Companions (may Allah be pleased with
them all) for allegedly going against the command of the Messenger
(B)and agreeing on that, so that they could undermine and reject
what the Companions narrated of Qur'an and hadith to future
generations of ~ u s l i m s . ~ ~ '
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said in his
refutation of al-IJilli: "As for the appointment of 'Ali by name, there
is nothing of that nature in the reliable books of the hadith scholars;
all the scholars of hadith are unanimously agreed that it is false. Ahu
Muhammad ibn Hazm said: 'We did not find any report with anyone
about this so-called instrnction, except one report which goes back to
an unknown narrator who goes by the kunyah of Abu d-Hamra', hut
we do not know who he was at
Elsewhere he said:
"Therefore we conclude that what the Rififidisclaim about 'Ali being
appointed as the Prophet's successor is something that none of the
scholars, past or present, who have knowledge of the words of the
Messenger of Allah (gJ,
heard anything about. Hence the scholars of
hadith know for certain that this report is false, as they know that
other reports are false."432
However, among later extremists, there were those who
revived Ibn Saba's theory concerning Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (4).
They expanded it to include the descendants of 'Ali and al-Husayn,
using this as a cover to stir up people's emotions and reach their
hearts, in order to achieve their aims against the Islamic state. The
first one to st& spreading the idea that leadership was limited to
specific members of Ah1 al-Bayt was Shaytin at-T%q,whom the Shia
call Mu'min at-^%^?^^ When Zayd ibn 'Ali found out abont that, he
sent for him to ask abont this nunour. Zayd said to him: "I have heard
that you are claiming that among the family of Muhammad, there is
an Imam to whom obedience is obligatory." Shay* a ~ - ~ said:

"Yes, your father 'Ali ibn al-Husayn was one of them." He said:

"How can that be, when he would take a mouthful of food, and if it
was hot, he would cool it with his hand and then put it in my mouth?
Do you think that he could protect me from the heat of this mouthful
and not protect me from the fire of hell?" Shay* at-Tiq said: "He
did not want to tell you lest you reject it and thus become a
disbeliever, then he would not be able to intercede for
This story, which was narrated in the most reliable book of
biography they have, shows that this theory was circulating in secret
to the point that it was unknown to one of the imams of Ah1 al-Bayt,
namely Imam Zayd. Muhihh ad-Deen al-Khateeb stated that Shaytin
at-Tiq was the first one to fabricate this misguided belief, limiting the
position of the imamate and legislation to them and claiming
infallibility for specific people among Ah1 a l - ~ a ~Shaytin

It
seems that the belief in limiting imamate to specific people started in
~ u f a h , ~with
~ ' the efforts of a group of followers of H i s h h and
Shay6n at-Tiq. Thus the foundations for the idea of limiting the
imamate to a specific number were laid down in the second century
by a group of people who claimed to have connections to Ah1 alBayt, such as Shaytk at-Tiq and H i s h h ibn a l - ~ a k a mBeliefs
.~~~
and ideas about the number of Imams differed among the various
Shiite groups. It says in Mukhtajar at-Tuhfah: "It should be noted
that the Imamis limit the number of Imams, but they differed as to the
exact number. Some of them said it is five, some said it is seven,
some said it is eight, some said it is twelve and some said it is
thirteen."439
The books of the Shia give an idea of these differences and
contradictions, whether the books are those of the Ismailis, such as
Masci'il al-lmamah by an-Nkhi' al-Akbar or az-Zeenah by Abu
Hitim ar-Rizi, or of the Twelvers, such as al-Maqcilrit wal-Firaq by
al-Ash'ari al-Qummi and Firaq ash-Shia by an-Nawhakhti. The

386

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

issue of imamate is not a minor issue for them, in which differences
might be regarded as normal. It is the basic foundation of their
religion, and they say that the one who does not believe in their Imam
has no religion. Hence they regard one another as disbelievers; even
the followers of one Imam may regard each other as disbelievers and
curse one another.440 The Twelvers later settled on limiting the
imamate to twelve Imams, but there was no one in the Prophet's
family, Banu Hkhim, at the time of the Messenger of Allah (gJ,
Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthm2n or 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them)
who believed in the imamate of twelve
This belief was
only known after the death of al-Hasan alLZAskariin 260 AH."'
Limiting the Imams to a specificnumber is a false and compt
belief of which Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) and his sons and
grandsons are innocent. In the major Shiite reference book, Nahj alBali?ghah, it is narrated from 'Ali (5%) that he said: ''have me alone
and find someone else, for we are facing new developments of
different types, which are overwhelming and confusing. There are
clouds on the horizon, and the path is not clear. You should
understand that if I accept your offer, I will lead you to what I believe
to be right, and I will not listen to the rebuke of anyone. But if you
leave me alone, I will be like one of you, and probably I will be more
obedient to whoever yon appoint as your leader. I can serve you
better as an adviser than as a r ~ l e r . " " ~
If the imamate of 'Ali had been something decreed by Allah
(&), it would not have been permissible for 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&),
under any circumstances to say to the people, "Leave me alone and
find someone else," or to say, "I can serve you better as an adviser
than as a ruler." How could he do that when the people wanted him to
be a ruler and came to swear allegiance to him?4"
He says something even clearer in an-Nahj: "The people have
sworn allegiance to me who swore allegiance to Abu Bakr, 'Umar

'AZi ibn Abi Tilib

387

and 'Uthmk, and on the same terns. The one who was present could
not have a say in the matter, and the one who was absent has no right
to object. Rather decision-making belongs to the Muhijijireen and
An& if they are unanimously agreed on a man and appoint him as
leader, this must reflect the approval of Allah (g).
If someone rebels
against them by rejecting what they agreed to or by introducing
innovation, they will have the right to try to bring him back to that
which he rebelled against; if he persists, they will fight him for
following a way other than the believers' way, and Allah (&) will
keep him in the path he has chosen."44s
With these words, Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) highlighted
some facts worth paying attention to:
(a) The ones among the Companions of the Messenger of
Allah (g)
who bad the right to reach a decision on the
basis of mutual consultation were the Muhijireen and
An$$, they were the decision-makers.
(b) Their agreement on a person was a reason for Allah's

approval and a sign that He was pleased with their choice.
(c) No one could become the leader or attain authority during
their era without their choosing him or their consent.
(d) No one rejected their decision or rebelled against their
ruling except an innovator and transgressor who was
following a way other than that of the believers.
How do the Twelver Shia understand these important statements?446
The appointment of 'Ali (&) as Imam by name could not be
proven by any means, and the issue of limiting the number of Imams
to a specific number is to be rejected according to the Qur'an and
Sunnah. It is neither rational nor realistic, because after this specific
number, is the Ummah to remain without an Imam or ruler? The era
of the visible Imams, according to the Twelvers, was little more than

i

388

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

two and a half centuries. The Shia were compelled to find a way out
of the problem of limiting the number of Imams, so they introduced
the idea of the scholar acting on behalf of the Imam, but they differed
concerning the extent of this deputation.4" In modem times, they
were forced to abandon this principle completely, even though it is
the foundation of their religion. They made the appointment of their
head of state something that could be done by means of election; they
abandoned the idea of limiting the number and instead limited the
quality or type, restricting leadership of the state to 'the Shiite
i~rists'.~~~

What the Twelver Shia quote as evidence from the
Sunni books for limiting the number of Imams
It was narrated that Jibir ihn Samurah said: "There will be
twelve rulers. Then he said something that I did not hear. and my
father said that he said: 'All of them from ~ u r a ~ s h . In
" ' Muslim,
~~~
it is narrated that Jibir said: "I heard the Messenger of Allah
say:
'Islam will continue to prevail for the time of twelve caliphs,' then he
said a word that I did not understand, and I said to my father: 'What
did he say?' He said: 'All of them from ~ u r a ~ s h . According
" ' ~ ~ ~ to
another version: "This religion will continue to prevail and be strong
for the time of twelve caliphs."451 According to yet another version:
"The people's affairs will continue to be prosperous during the reign
of twelve men."452 Ahu Diwood narrated: "This religion will
continue to prevail until you have had twelve caliphs, under all of
whom the Ummah will be united."453 Abu Diwood narrated a
similar report via al-Aswad ibn Sa'eed from Jsbir, and he said that he
added: "When he returned to his house, Quraysh came to him and
said: 'Then what will happen?' He said: 'Killing."3454

(s)

The Twelvers cling to this text and quote it as evidence against
Ah1 as-Sunnah, not because they believe in what is mentioned in the

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

389

books of the ~ u n n i s but
, ~ they
~ ~ quote the hadiths they believe in.
However, by examining the text with neutraLity and objectivity, we
find that these twelve men are described as becoming caliphs, and it
is said that at their time, Islam will be strong and prevailing, the
people will be united behind them, and they will still he in a good
state. None of these attributes is applicable to those whom the
Twelvers claim as their Imams. None of them became caliph except
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali and al-Hasan for a short time. The Ummah
was not prosperous or prevailing during the periods of any of these
twelve Imams, even according to the Shia themselves. On the
contrary, the Ummah "continued to deteriorate and was ruled by
evildoers and even by di~believers,"~'~
and "the Imams themselves
concealed their religious affairs by means of taqiyyah."457 The era of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), when he was in a position of power
and was a caliph, was 'an era of taqiyyah,' as was clearly stated by
their sbaykh a l - ~ u f e e dHe
. ~"could
~ ~ not bring out the Qur'an or rule
in accordance with many Islamic rulings," as was clearly stated by
their shaykh a l - ~ a z i ' i r i ? ~He
~ was "forced to go along with his
companions and appease them at the expense of religion," as was
stated by their shaykh a l - ~ u r t a d a . ~ ~ '
Thus this hadith has nothing to do with their claims at all.
Moreover, it does not limit the Imams to this number; it is a prediction
from the Prophet (B)
that Islam would continue to prevail during the
era of these people. The eras of the Rightly Guided Caliphs and the
Umayyads were periods of power and ~ t r e n ~ t h . 4Ibn
~ ' Taymiyah
said: "Islam and the rule of Islam were stronger and more farreaching at the time of the Umayyads than after their time." He
quoted as evidence the hadith, "This matter will continue to prevail
for the time of twelve caliphs, all of whom are from Quraysh." Then
he said: "This is how it was. The caliphs were Abu Bakr, 'Umar,
'Uthmin and 'Ali, then those who took over under whom the people
united and who had power and strength, namely Mu'2wiyah and his

390

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

son Yazeed, then 'Abdul-Malik and his four sons, among whom was
'Umar ibn 'Abdul-'Azeez. After that came the declime which has
continued until today." Then he explained that.462
Concerning the hadith, 'all of them from ~ n r a ~ s hhe, said:
'~~~
"This means that they are not limited to 'Ali and his descendants. If
they were limited to 'Ali (&) and his descendants, he would have
mentioned something to refer to that exclusivity. Don't yon see that
he did not say: all of them from among the descendants of Ismceel or
from among the Arabs. If they were distinguished by the fact that
they were all from Banu Hishim or from among the descendants of
'Ali, then the hadith would have referred to that. But as he said that
they would all be from among Quraysh in general, it is known that
they are from Quraysh, but they are not from a particular clan or tribe;
rather they are from Banu Tayrn, Banu 'Adiyy, Banu 'Abd Shams
and Banu H2shim. The Rightly Guided Caliphs were from these
tribes."464 SO there is nothing left of the description to match the
description that they want except the number only, and the number
does not mean anything.465

Their evidence from the Qur'an
The Shia did not find anything that would support their belief
in imamate on the basis of Qur'anic texts, so they quoted verses from
the Book of Allah that praised His righteous slaves and pious close
friends, and they interpreted them as if they referred exclusively to
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) on the basis of this corrupt belief, just
as they fabricated many hadiths to support this reprehensible
innovation. They did this in order to ensnare ignorant Muslims and
those who had little knowledge about this subject. The arguments
they presented concerning this are clearly false, and their argument is
not free of two issues:
(a) Either what they quoted as evidence for that claim is
sound, such as the verse of purification, the verse of

'Ali ibn Abi Thlib

391

mubaalah, the hadith of the banner, the hadith of Khumm
and other hadiths,
(b) or the hadiths were fabricated, and fabricated reports
cannot be used as evidence.
Hence it is well established among the scholars that the R2fidis
are the most mendacious of the groups that claim to belong to Islam.
Ibn Taymiyah stated that there was consensus among the scholars of
hadith who h o w abont narrations and chains of narration that the
R%&s are the most untruthful of all groups, and this attribute is
ancient in them. Hence the leading scholars of Islam h o w that this
group is distinguished by its lying.466The following are some
examples of how they quoted Qur'an as evidence:

1. The verse of the imamate (Qur'an 5: 55)
Allah ( B )says: (Verily, your Wali [Protector or Helper] is
none other than Allah, His Messenger, and the believers, - those
who perform As-Saliih [Iqiimah-as-Saliih],and give ZaMh, and they
are Riiki'oon [those who bow down or submit themselves with
obedience to Allah in
(Qur'an 5: 55)
Their commentary on this verse is indicative of their claim that
it is speaking abont the imamate of 'Ali. Shaykh at-TiYifah, whom
they call at-Toosi, said: "As for evidence of his imamate in the
Qur'an, the strongest evidence for it is the verse in which Allah (s)
says...", then he goes on to quote the verse mentioned above.467AtTnb~usisaid: 'This verse is one of the clearest indications of the
validity of the imamate of 'Aliafter the Prophet, with no dispute."468
Their shaykhs are virtually agreed that this is the strongest evidence
they have, and they present it as the main proof when quoting the
evidence in their books.469AS to how they derive any evidence from
this verse to support their claim, they say: "The regular and
prominent interpreters of Qnr'an and scholars of Hadith are agreed
that it was revealed concerning 'Ali (&), when he gave his ring in

392

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

charity to the poor man when he was praying, in the presence of the
Companions, and it is mentioned in the six sound books."470
The word innama (translated here as 'verily') is indicative of
exclusivity (as in 'no one but...'), according to the consensus of the
linguists. The word 'wali' means the most fitting to be in charge; in
other words, the most fitting to be the Imam or caliph?" We can see
that when they quote this verse as evidence, they rely on what was
narrated about the reason for its revelation, because there is nothing
in the text of the verse to support what they are hying to prove. Thus
their argument ends up being based on the report about the reason for
revelation and not on the Qur'an itself. But is the report proven, and
is that argument sound? This question may be answered by noting the
following points:

1.a.
Their claim that the Sunnis are unanimously agreed that this
verse was revealed concerning 'Ali (&) is one of the greatest false
claims. On the contrary, the scholars of hadith agreed that it was not
revealed specifically about 'Ali (&) and that he did not give his ring
in charity while praying; they agreed that this story is false and
fabricated.472 The assertion that it is mentioned in the six sound
hooks473is also a lie, because this report does not appear in any of the
six books. Ibn Katheer quoted the reports saying that this verse was
revealed concerning 'Ali (&) when he gave his ring in charity, and
he commented on them by noting: "None of them is sound at all
because of the weakness of their chains of narration and the fact that
the men (in these chains of narration) are unknown."474 'Abdul'Azeez ad-Dahlawi said: "As for the idea that it was revealed
concerning 'Ali ibn Ahi Taih (&), and the reports about the beggar
and 'Ali giving his ring to him in charity while he was bowing in
prayer, this was narrated by z~th-Tha'labi~~~
only. He is the only one
who narrated it, and the Sunni schola~sof hadith do not pay any
attention to ath-Tha'lahi at all. They called him 'one who cuts wood

'AIi ibn Abi Tllib

393

at night and cannot tell fresh wood from dry wood'; in other words,
they said that he does not know what he is doing. Most of these
reports come from al-Kalbi from Abu Siilih, and these are the
weakest of reports on Qur'anic interpretation according to them."476
According to sound reports, the reason for the revelation of
this verse was that Banu Qaynuqa' betrayed the Messenger (g)
and
went to 'Ubidah ibn as-Sinit - as Ibn Jareer mentioned in his
Tafseer - wanting 'Ubidah to join them. He rejected them,
regarding them as enemies, and he declared his love and support for
AUah (s)and His Messenger. Then Allah (s)revealed these
words: $Verily, your Wali [Protector or Helper] is none other than
Allah, His Messenger, and the believers - those who perform AsSalcih [Zqiimah-as-Salcih],and give Zakcih, and they are Ri?ki'oon
[those who bow down or submit themselves with obedience to Allah
in
(Qur'an 5: 55). This means that when they pray and give
zakih, they do so with humility and submission to Allah (&) in all
their affairs.
At the beginning of this passage, Allah (&) says: 4 0 you who
believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliyci' [friends,
protectors, helpers], they are but AwliyLi' of each other. And if any
amongst you takes them [as Awliyi?'],then surely, he is one of them.
Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the &ilimoon
[polytheists and wrongdoers and unjustlb (Qur'an S: 51). This refers
to Abdullah ibn Ubayy ibn Salool; he allied himself with Banu
Qaynuqa' and when a dispute arose between them and the Prophet
(g),
he showed loyalty to them and stood with them, and he went to
the Prophet (g)
.- to intercede for them. 'Ubidah ibn as-Sinit, on the
other hand, disavowed them and rejected them. Allah
followed
that with a description of the attributes of the believers, which applied
to 'Ubzdah ibn a s - S h i t and those who were with him: e e r i l y , your
Wali [Protector or Helper] is none other than Allah, His Messenger,

(s)

394

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shiu

and the believers), (Qur'an 5: 55). So this verse was revealed
concerning 'Ubidah ibn as-~%nit?77
These verses enjoin helping and supporting the believers and
forbid taking disbelievers as friends. This meaning is also clearly
supported - after one learns the real reason for its revelation - by
the context of the verse. Before this verse, Allah (s)
says: 4 0 you
who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Awliyi'
[friends, protectors, helpers], they are but Awliyi' of each other. And
if any amongst you takes them [as Awliyi'],then surely, he is one of
them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the mlimoon
[polytheists and wrongdoers and unjust]) (Qur'an 5: 51). This is a
clear prohibition on taking the Jews and Christians as close friends or
loving and supporting them. 'Wiliyah' in this context, according to
scholarly consensus, does not refer to leadership; there is no
reference to leadership in these verses at all. This is followed by
mention of those to whom loyalty must be shown, namely Allah
(%),His Messenger and the believers. It is clear that the loyalty, love
and support that Allah
forbids in the first part of the verse are
exactly the same as that which He enjoins on the believers in this
verse; the one is the opposite of the other, as is clear in the ~ r a b i c . 4 ~ '
Ar-R&i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "Whereas in the
previous verse, Allah forbade loyalty to the disbelievers, in this verse
He enjoined loyalty to those to whom loyalty is due."479 Ibn
Taymiyah said: "It is well established and well known among the
scholars of Qur'anic commentary, of the earlier and later generations,
that this verse was revealed to prohibit loyalty and love towards the
disbelievers and to enjoin loyalty and love towards the believers."480

(s)

1.b.
Allah ( B )does not praise anyone except for that which is
praiseworthy before Him, whether it is obligatory or recommended.
According to scholarly consensus, giving in charity while praying is

395

1

not recommended. If it were, the Messenger (g)
would have done it

1

'Aliibn Abi Tilib

and encouraged others to do it, and he would have done it repeatedly.
During prayer, a person is preoccupied, and giving to a beggar is
something that can he done later, so the one who wants to give
charity can give it after saying the s a l h (at the end of the prayer). Ln
fact, being distracted by giving to people who are begging invalidates
the prayer, in the view of a number of scholars.481

Even if we assume that this is allowed during prayer, what
reason is there for specifying the position of bowing? How can it be
said that there is no wali (friend, helper or protector) except those
who give charity while they are howing? If it is said that this was for
the purpose of identifying 'Ali (&), the response is that 'Ali (&)
had many other obvious qualities by which he could be identified, so
why would he not be identified by his known qualities and instead he
identified by this, by which no one would recognise him except those
who heard this story and believed in it? The majority of the Umrnah
has never heard of this report, which is not in any of the reliable
hooks of the ~ u s l i r n s . ~ ~ ~

Their idea that 'Ali (&) gave his ring in zak2l1 when he was
bowing, then this verse was revealed, is contrary to reality. He was
poor, and the zak% on silver is only required one year after taking
possession of it, so 'Ali
was not one of those from whom z a k a
was due at the time of the Prophet (&).483

(4)

The basic principle with regard to zak& is that it must he given
at the initiative of the one who is paying it; he should not wait until

Their saying that leadership is meant by the word 'wali' in this
verse is not in accordance with the words of Allah (&): (Verily, your
WaE [Protector or Helper] is none other than Allah, His Messenger,
and the believers) (Qur'an 5: 55). Allah (g)
cannot be described as
being the ruler and leader of His slaves. He is their Creator, Provider,
Lord and Sovereign, and His is the creation and commandment,485
but it cannot be said that Allah
is the leader (amir) of the
believers as it is said that a ruler such as 'Ali is Amir al~ u ' m i n e e n . 4With
~ ~ regard to its meaning friendship as opposed to
enmity, Allah takes care of His believing slaves. He loves them, and
they love Him; He is pleased with them, and they are pleased with
Him. Whoever takes a friend of His as an enemy, Allah ( B )declares
war on him!87 This type of friendship is what is meant in the verse.

(a)

Moreover, the phrase Band they are Rriki'oon [those who bow
down or submit themselves with obedience to AUah in prayer])
(Qur'an 5: 55) means that they are submitting to their Lord and
following His commands. Tbe word rukoo' (which may mean
bowing) originally means submission, so it means that they establish
prayer and pay zakih in a state of submission, which is humility and
humbleness before ~ l l a h . 4Allah

(@I: (And Diwood [David] guessed that We have hied him and he
sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate [kharra

down in prostration, but it is described as rriki'an [lit. bowing] here
because it was an expression of his state of humility and submission to
Allah (&). Allah also says: (And when it is said to them: 'Bow down
[irka'u]!' They bow not down) (Qur'an 77: 48). Here, 'bow down'
means humble yourselves and submit to the command of ~ l l a h . 4 ' ~

They quote as evidence the word innama; as we noted above,
it is translated here as 'verily', but it indicates exclusivity. They argue
that it refers to 'Ali (&) in particular and thus declares invalid the
rulership of the previous caliphs, but if this were the case, it would
also declare invalid the rulership of the later Imams. According to
this logic, the imamate of the two sons of 'Ali and the Imams who
came after them is also rendered invalid. If their response to this
dilemma is to say that what is meant by limiting imamate or mlership
is limiting it to a particular time, as in the time when he was a ruler
and not the time of the Imams after him, then this means that they are
agreeing with the Sunnis that general rulership was for him only
during the time when he was the Imam or ruler, and not before
that.490

Lf -as their shaykhs say -this is the strongest evidence they
have, then it is clear that they do not have a leg to stand on. The basic
principle with regard to such an important and fundamental issue which for the Rz&s is the most important matter of religion, and the
one who denies it is regarded as a disbeliever - is that it should he
based on texts with very clear wording that can be grasped by people
of all levels.& should be understood by the common folk as it is
understood by the scholars, understood by later generations as it was
understood by those who heard it directly, and understood by desert
people as it is understood by city dwellers. Since there is no such
clear text in the Book of Allah, this proves that there is no statement
appointing 'Ali (&) by name to be the Prophet's successor as they
claimed.491This is the strongest verse they quoted as evidence from
the Book of Allah, and they call it the verse of the imamate. They also
cling to other verses which were quoted by Ibn al-Mutahhar al-Hilli,
to which Ibn Taymiyah gave a comprehensive answer.492

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

2. The verse of m u b a a l a h (Qur'an 3: 61)
The verse of mub&alah, which was revealed concerning the
Christian delegation of Najrk, is regarded by the Twelver Shia as
another proof for their claims of imamate. Io this verse, Allah says:
@hen whoever disputes with you concerning him ['Eesa (Jesus)] after
[all this] knowledge that has come to you [i.e. 'Eesa (Jesus) being a
slave of Allah, and having no share in Divinity], say [O Muhammad]:
'Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your
women, ourselves and yourselves - then we pray and invoke
[sincerely] the Curse of Allah upon those who lie.'B (Qur'an 3: 61)
The way they interpret this verse to prove the imamate of 'Ali
ibn Abi T%b, according to a;-Toosi and other Shiite scholars, is by
saying that the verse refers to the superiority of 'Ali in two ways:
(i) The aim of the m u b a d a h is to distinguish who is
following truth from who is following falsehood, and no
one should issue such a challenge except one who is
sincere, whose belief is definitely sound and who is the
best of people before Allah (g).
(ii) The Prophet (g)
made 'Ali the same as himself, based on
the words 'ourselves and yourseIves', because what is
meant by the words 'our sons' is al-Hasan and al-Husayn,
what is meant by 'our women' is Fiyimah, and what is
meant by 'ourselves' is himself and 'Ali (>@k). Because he
made him like himself, then no one else should come
anywhere near his superiority and virtue.493
The verse of mubihalah is so called because everyone who
follows the truth would wish that Allah
would destroy the
follower of falsehood who is debating with him, especially if there is
proof (in this challenge) that he is following the truth and manifesting
it. The challenge was that the wrongdoers were to die, and life was

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

399

very dear to them because of what they h e w of their bad fate after
death. There is no support in the verse of mub&alah for what the
Twelver Shia claim about imamate, for a number of reasons:

Despite the many meanings and synonyms of the Arabic word
for 'self, which the Imamis quoted as evidence that the text refers to
the caliphate of 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&), there is no meaning of this
word, either literal or metaphorical, that indicates the meaning of
caliphate. What the Sunnis understand from this verse is that it refers
to the Prophet
praying, alone or in the presence of his brothers in
Islam or through blood and ties, and this is something that is in
accordance with Arabic usage and with religious terminology. AzZubaydi said: "Ibn Kh2lawayh said: 'The [Arabic for the] word 'self
may mean brother."' Ibn Baniy said: 'The evidence for that is the
verse in which AUah says: 4Bnt when you enter the houses, greet one
another [lit. greet yourselves]~(Qur'an 24: 61)." Ibu 'Arafah
interpreted the words 4Why then, did not the believers, men and
women, when you heard it [the slander], think good of their own
people [lit. think good of themselves] and say: 'This [charge] is an
obvious Lie?') (Qur'an 24: 12) as referring to people of faith or people
of their own religion.494Ad-Dahlawi said, concerning the verse of
mub&alah: "What is meant by 'let us call' is 'let us bring ourselves'.
Moreover, even if we agree that the ruler, Imam 'Ali, was appointed
by the Prophet (g)
on the basis of the word 'ourselves', then who is
referred to as ruler of the disbelievers in the word 'yourselves', even
though they are all included in the word for 'let us call'? There is no
point in the Prophet (g)
calling himself and his children after the
r ,2495
word 'come .

(a)

The words 'ourselves' and 'yourselves' are like the usage in
the verse in which Allah (&) says, 4Why then, did not the believers,
men and women, when you heard it [the slander], think good of their

400

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

own people [lit. think good of themselves] and say: 'This [charge] is
an obvious lie?') (Qur'an 24. 12), which was revealed about the
Mother of the Believers 'i'ishah (r&d) and the slander incident. One
person could be meant by the Arabic word for 'selves' here.
Similarly, in the verse (iSo turn in repentance to your Creator and kill
yourselves [the innocent kill the wrongdoers among you]) (Qur'an 2:
54), what is meant is some killing others. In the verse: #And
[remember] when We took your covenant [saying]: Shed not the
blood of your [people], nor tnm out your own people [lit. do not turn
out yourselves] from their dwellings,) (Qur'an 2: 84) what is meant is
'do not expel one another'. So the Arabic word that is translated as
'selves' may refer to brothers, either by blood or by faith.496

(s):

Allah (&) says concerning His Messenger
4Verily, there
has come unto you a Messenger [Muhammad] from amongst
yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or
difficulty. He [Muhammad] is anxious over you; for the believers @e
is] full of pity, kind, and merciful) (Qur'an 9: 128). This verse
contains clear proof against the argument that the word 'selves' (in
the verse of m u b a d a h ) refers to individuals that are identical,
because here it is speaking of the Messenger of Allah (g)
and the
disbelievers of Makkah, yet it says 'from amongst yourselves'. Who
could say that the 'self of the Messenger of Allah (g)
is the same as
the 'selves' of the disbelievers of Makkah? Allah forbid!
This discussion illustrates how they follow whims and desires
in explaining the verse of mnbZbalah. The Shiite scholars ignore all
of these texts, then they come to this verse and exaggerate its
meaning to the extent that they say that 'Ali (&) is the same as
Muhammad (g)
except in prophethood. Some Shiite reports even
indicate that using the word for 'ourselves' to refer to a brother or
relative or people of the same group is something that was known
among the Arabs. It was narrated that Ahu Abdullah (&) said:

j

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

401

"Amir d-Mu'mineen ['Ali] (4)
sent Abdullah ibn al-'Ahbk to Ibn
d-Kawa' and his companions, and he was wearing a thin chemise
and a suit. When they looked at him, they said: '0 Ibn 'Abbh, you
are the best among ourselves, yet you are wearing such [fine]
clothes.' He said: 'I am the first to dispute with you concerning that.
AUah (s)says: (Say [ 0 Muhammad]: 'Who has forbidden the
adornment with clothes given by AUah, which He has produced for
His slaves, and At-Tayyibif [all kinds of Halil (lawful) things] of
food?), (Qur'an 7: 32) and (0 Children of Adam! Take your
adomment @y wearing your clean clothes] while praying [and going
round (the Tawaf of) the Ka'bahIB (Qur'an 7: 31)."'
After all this Qur'anic evidence and this Shiite report, is there
any room for the extremists to speakP9'

2.b.
One of the prominent Shiite scholars, ash-Shareef ar-Radiy,
admitted that the verse in which Allah (&) mentions 'ourselves'
does not mean that 'Ali (&) is the same as the Messenger of Allah
(g),
as the Shia say. He said: "The Arabs, in their language, may
refer to a cousin who is close or a relative as being 'the self of his
cousin, or a close friend as being 'the self' of his close friend. The
evidence for that is the verse in which Allah (&) says: (Nor defame
one another [lit. yourselves], nor insult one another by nicknamesb
(Qur'an 49: 11). What Allah
means is: 'Do not criticise your
believing brothers,' so He refers to the brotherhood of faith as being
like the brotherhood of blood. If the word for 'self may be applied to
a distant relative, it is more appropriate to be applied to a close
relative. The poet said: 'On the day of Qura, we were killing
ourselves,' meaning that it was as if we were killing ourselves by
killing our brothers, and he regarded the 'self of his kinsmen as
being the same as his own 'self. With regard to the verse in Soorat
an-Noor in which Allah (&)says, BBU~ when you enter the houses,

(s)

402

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

greet one another [lit. greet yourselveslB (Qur'an 24: 611, it may be
interpreted in a similar manner, because in the commentq it says
that it means to greet one another. It is not possible for a person to
greet himself, and it is inappropriate to interpret it in this way. The
'selves' of the believers are like one 'self since they are following
one religion, and this is a religious instruction. So if one of them
greets his brother, it is like greeting himself, because the differences
are lifted and the 'selves' have become one."498
Thus it becomes clear that the Shia have no argument to
support their claim that this verse indicates that the Messenger of
Allah (gJ
and 'Ali
are equal and the same. The Arabic word
that is translated as 'self may apply to one who is a distant relative,
so applying it to one who is a close relative is more appropriate than
that, but this does not refer to imamate in any way whatsoever.499

(4)

2.c.

The aim of mubihalah is for the one who is calling for it to
prove his sincerity and truthfulness by assembling himself and his
family -whom he naturally loves more than he loves others who are
more distant from him - and calling for destruction if he is not
sincere.500The fact that the Prophet (g)
called the most closelyrelated of people to him is clear evidence that he was a m e Prophet.
When the Christians of Najrh saw that, they feared for themselves
and gave up the idea of muhadah. As for the Rififidi innovators, they
did not understand the meaning of these verses of the noble Qur'an
because they rejected the truth and did not want to submit to it?''

2.d.
The contention of the h a m i Shia, that the verse is indicative
of equality between 'Ali (&) and the Prophet (B)except in
prophetbood, is something that is not to be accepted at all. No one,
whether it is 'Ali (&) or anyone else, is equal to the Prophet in
matters of religion. w h a t comparison can there be between the

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

403

Messenger of Allah (g)and
, the level of human perfection he
reached, and any other person?
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) himself would nor accept what
the Imami Shia say about him, and any wise and fair-minded person
would understand this issue clearly?02 The position of prophethood
is one that was held in great esteem by Amir al-Mu'mineen, and we
have discussed that in this book.

2.e.
Major issues of belief and basic fundamentals of religion must
be proven by clear Qur'anic verses with definitive meanings. For
example, the verse, (None has the right to be worshipped but He, the
Ever Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists)
(Qur'an 2: 255) is about tawheed; tiMuhammad is the Messenger of
Allah) (Qur'an 48: 29) is about the prophethood of Muhammad (&);
and (And perfonn As-Salrit [lqrimat-as-Salrit] (Qur'an 24: 56), is
about the obligatory nature of prayer.503

3. "Say (0 Muhammad): 'No reward d o I ask
of you for this except to be kind to me
for my kinship with you."' (Qur'an 42: 23)
In their commentary on this verse, the Imarni Shia narrate a
hadith, which they attribute to the Prophet (g),
in which he defined
kinship (in this verse) as referring to 'Ali, Fztimah and their sons. The
Imami Shia say that this supports the belief in their superiority and
the duty to love them, and hence the duty to obey them and take them
as Imams or leaders to the exclusion of others.5M
The response to the above is as follows:
This verse appears in Soorat ashShoora, which was revealed
in Makkah before the migration to Madinah, according to the
consensus of Ah1 a s - ~ u n n a h ?It~ is
~ well known that 'Ali did not

many F i ~ a until
h after the battle of Badr, which was in 2 AH, alHasan was born in 3 AH and al-Husayn in 4 AH. This verse was
revealed many years before the existence of d-Hasan and al-Husayn,
so how could the Prophet (@J interpret it as referring to the
obligation to honour relatives who were not yet known or born? 506

3.b.
The commentary on this verse that appears in a$-Saheeh is
contrary to that. Bukhari narrated, with his chain of narration going
back to Ihn 'AbbL (&), that he was asked about the verse (except
to be kind to me for my kinship with you) (Qur'an 42: 23). Sa'eed ibn
Juhayr said: "It refers to the relatives of Muhammad
Ibn
'Abbis said: "You are being too hasty. There was no clan of Quraysh
to whom the Prophet (g)
was not related through blood ties, so he
said: 'All I ask of you is to uphold the ties of kinship between you and
me.,,,507 Ibn Taymiyah said: "Here is Ibn 'Abb&, the interpreter of
the Qur'an and the most knowledgeable of Ah1 d-Bayt after 'Ali,
saying: 'This does not mean being kind to my relatives. Rather it
means: I do not ask you, 0 Arabs and 0 Quraysh, for any reward;
instead, I ask you to uphold the ties of kinship between me and you.'
So he asked the people to whom he was sent first of all to uphold
these ties of kinship with him and not to transgress against him, so
that he could convey the message of his ~ o r d . " ~ ' ~

(e)."

3.c.
The hadith that they regard as explaining the verse is false and
fabricated, according to the consensus of the scholars of hadith who
h . Katheer
~'~
decide such issues; this was stated by Ibn ~ a ~ m i ~ aIbn
also compiled all the hadiths that were narrated concerning the
interpretation of this verse and determined that the hadiths stating
that the kinship mentioned here refers to F&nah and her sons have
weak chains of narration. He narrated a report from b n Abi Hitim
that says: "A man whom he named told us, Husayn d-Ashqar told us,

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

405

from Qays, from al-A'mash, from Sa'eed ihn Jnhayr, from Ibn
'Ahhis (&), who said: 'When the verse dSay [0Muhammad]: 'No
reward do I ask of you for this except to be kind to me for my kinship
with yon') (Qur'an 42: 23) was revealed, they said: "0 Messenger of
Allah, who are these whom Allah has enjoined us to be kind to?" He
said: "Fitimah and her two sons, may Allah be pleased with
them.""' But the chain of narration of this report includes someone
who is dubious and is not known; he narrated from a fanatic Shiite
shaykh, namely Husayn al-Ashqar, whose reports cannot he accepted
in this context. Stating that this verse was revealed in Madinah is farfetched, because it is Makkan, andat that time Ficimah (&) did not
have any children at all, since she did not get married to 'Ali (&)
until after the battle of Badr in 2 AH. The correct interpretation of this
verse is the one given by the scholar of the Ummah and the
interpreter of the Qur'an, Abdullah ibn 'Abbh (&). Ibn Hajar also
discussed the weakness of the reports mentioned and the fact that
they are contrary to the sound hadith~.~"

The sound version of the hadith is that which was narrated by
Imam Muslim in his Saheeh from the hadith of Zayd ihn Arqam
(&,who
I, said: "One day the Messenger of Allah (gJstood and
addressed us at a watering place called Khnmm, between Makkah

and reminded us, then he said: '0 people, I am only human. Soon the
messenger of my Lord will come to me, and I will respond. I an
leaving among you two weighty things, the first of which is the Book

then he said: 'And the people of my household, I remind you of Allah
with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah
with regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah
with regard to the people of my household."' Husayn [one of the
narrators] asked him: "Who are the people of his household, 0 Zayd?
Aren't his wives among the people of his household?" He said: "His
wives are among the people of his household, but the people of his
household are those to whom z a k a is forbidden after he is gone."
Husayn asked: "Who are they?" Zayd replied: "They are the family
of 'Ali, the family of 'Aqeel, the family of Ja'far, and the family of
'Abbh." He asked: "Was zak2h forbidden to all of these?" He

to additional material, such as the words "0Allah, support those who

this material is regarded as sound by some of the scholars, but the
correct view is that it is not sound. As for the addition "support those
who support him and humiliate those who humiliate him, and make

407

truth connected to him wherever he goes," this is something that is
attributed falsely to the Prophet ( s ) . ~ ~ '
There was a good reason for the speech given by the Prophet

(g)
at Ghadeer Khumm. It was narrated that: 'The Prophet (g)
sent
'Ali to Kh%d ibn al-Waleed in Yemen to work out the one-fifth of
the booty and take it. When he had worked out the one-fifth of the
booty, there was a slave woman among the one-fifth who was the
best of the female captives and had ended up being counted as part of
the one-fifth. Then 'Ali (&) came out with his head covered, and he
had done ghnsl. They askid him about that, and he told them that the
slave woman who had been among the prisoners had become his, and
he had been intimate with her. Some of them objected to that, and
Buraydah ibn al-Husayb brought the letter of Khilid to the Prophet
(gg)Buraydah
.
was one of those who did not like 'Ali (&), and he
confirmed the contents of KhZlid's letter, which referred to what 'Ali
(4)
had done. The Prophet
said: 'Do not hate him, for he has
more right to the one-fifth than that."'5"

(s)

When the Farewell Pilgrimage took place, 'Ali (&) returned
from Yemen to join the hajj and brought the sacrificial animals with
him.523 He appointed one of his companions to be in charge of the
troops, and he hastened to meet the Messenger (g)
in Makkah. That
man gave the troops some garments that 'Ali (&)had, and when the
army drew close to Makkah, 'Ali (&)went out to meet them and
saw them wearing those suits. He said to his deputy: 'Woe to you,
what is this?" He said: "I clothed them like this today so that they
would look good when they came to the people." 'Ali said: "Woe to
So the
you, take them off before you meet the Messenger (g)."
deputy took away the suits and put them with the rest of the garments,
and the army started to complain about what 'ALi (&) had done to
them.524 When the people complained about 'Ali (&I,
the
Messenger of AUah (g)
stood up to address them. Ibn Katheer said:

408

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shiu

"There was a lot of talk and complaining about 'Ali (&) from that
army, because he had prevented them from using the zak& camels
and had taken back the suits that his deputy had let them have. And
Allah (&) knows best."
When the Messenger (@) was on his way back to Madinah
after finishing his hajj rituals, he passed by Ghadeer Khumm. There
he addressed the people and defended 'Ali (&>), confirming his high
status and pointing out his viaues so as to remove whatever negative
feelings the people might have developed about him.525
The Prophet (g)
did not give this speech when he was in
Makkah during the Farewell Pilgrimage on the day of 'Arafah;
instead he delayed the matter until he was on his way back to
Madinah. This indicates that the matter concerned the people of
Madinah only. Those who spoke against 'Ali (&) were from among
the people of Madinah, as they were the ones who were with 'Ali on
that campaign. Ghadeer Khumm is in al-Juhfah, which is
approximately 250 km from Makkah. Those who say that it was the
point where the pilgrims part ways are not correct; the gathering point
of the pilgrims is Makkah, so the place where the pilgrims part ways
could not he as far as 250 km away. The people of Makkah stay in
Makkah, the people of T2if return to T2if, the people of Yemen
return to Yemen, the people of Iraq return to Iraq, the Arab tribes
return to their original places and so on; when they have finished their
hajj, each returns to his own land. There was no one with the Prophet
(@) except the people of Madinah and those who were on their way
to their homes along the road to Madinah, so these are the people
whom the Prophet (g)
addressed.
The difference between the Sunnis and the R Z d i Shia has to
do with their understanding of what the Prophet (g)
said, not
whether or not he said it. The R2fidis say that the words "If I am a
person's mawla, 'Ali is also his mawla" mean: 'Whoever I am in

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

409

charge of, 'Ali is also in charge of." The Sunnis say that what is
meant by the Prophet's words "If I am a person's mawla, 'Ali is also
his mawla" refers to support and love, the opposite of which is
enmity. This is correct for a number of reasons:
1.a.
This was classed as sound by some scholars because of the
additional material, namely the words of the Prophet (g)
"0
:Allah,
support those who support him, and take as an enemy those who take
him as an enemy."526 Enmity explains the phrase 'Ali is also his
mawla," so it refers to people loving 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&).
"

1.b.
The word mawla may indicate a number of meanings. Ibn alAtheer said: "It may be applied to the master, owner, benefactor,
supporter, one who loves, ally, slave, freed slave, cousin (son of
paternal uncle) or ~on-in-law."~'~
The L a b s give all of these
meanings to the word mawla.

1.c.
There is no evidence in the hadith for the idea of imamate
(caliphate). If the Prophet (@) had been referring to caliphate, he
would not have used a word that may have all of these meanings that
were mentioned by Ibn al-Atheer. The Prophet (g)
was the most
eloquent of the Arabs, and he would have said clearly, " 'Ali is my
successor after me," or "'Ali is the ruler after me," or "If I die, then
listen to and obey 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib." However, the Prophet (@) did
not say any of these decisive words that could have put an end to the
dispute'if any arose. He said: "If I am a person's mawla, 'Ali is also
his m a ~ l a . " ~ ~ ~

l.d.

(s)

Allah
says: dYour abode is the fire. That is your maw16
[friend -proper place], and worst indeed is that destinations (Qur'an

41 0

'Ali's a t t i d e towards the Kharijites and Shia

57: 15). He called it mawla because it is close to the disbelievers

we seek refuge with Allah (g).

In the case of 'Ali (&), the fact that he is a mawla was proven
during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (#J and after his death,
and after the death of 'Ali (&). 'Ali (&) was the mawla of the
believers after the death of the Messenger of Allah (g),
and he was a
mawla to the believers after his own death (&).
Even now he is our
,.
mawla, as Allah (&)says: $Verily, your Wali [Protector or Helper] is
none other than Allah, His Messenger, and the believers) (Qur'an 5:
55). 'Ali (&) is one of the leaders of the believers.

Imam ash-Sh2fa'i said concerning the hadith of Zayd: What is
meant by that is the concept of love for the sake of Islam, as Allah
(g)
says: $That is because Allah is the Maw16 Lord, Master,
Helper, Protector] of those who believe, and the disbelievers have no
Mawli? [lord, master, helper, protector]) (Qur'an 47: 11).~'~
SO the
hadith does not say that 'Ali(&) should be the caliph after the death
of the Messenger of Allah (g);
it indicates that 'Ali is one of the
close friends of Allah
to whom love and support is due for the
sake of Allah (B).~~'

(s)

In general, in this speech given in Ghadeer Khumm, the
Prophet (g)
wanted to c o n f m the good character of 'Ali(&,), raise
his status and point out his virtues, so as to remove the ideas
harboured by some of these companions who had been with him in
Yemen, who had developed reservations about some of his conduct.
The Messenger of Allah (g)
did not want to do that during hajj,
because even though this incident had become widely known, it
remained limited to the people of Madinah. On the other hand, he did
not delay it until he reached Madinah, lest the hypocrites take

advantage of this incident in order to plot against the ~ u s l i m s . ~ ~ '
There is another indication that the Prophet (@) intended in this
speech to point out the virmes of 'Ali(&) to those who were
unaware of them. When Buraydah ibn al-Husayb began to criticise
'Ali (&)
in his presence - because he felt that 'Ali was no longer
,.
showing him kindness - the Prophet's expression changed, and he
said: "0 Buraydah, am I not closer to the believers than their own
selves?" Buraydah said: "Yes indeed, 0 Messenger of Allah." He
said: "If I am a person's mawla, 'Ali is also his m a ~ l a . " ~ ~ '
Some valuable research on this topic has been undertaken by
Dr. Muhammad 'Ali as-Saloos, who discussed the speech at Ghadeer
and the advice to adhere to the Qur'an and Sunnah. He studied the
reports about adhering to the Qur'an and Sunnah and the reports
about adhering to the Qur'an and the family of the Prophet
and
examined them critically, then he said: "From the above, we can see
that the hadith of the two weighty matters is one of the hadiths which
are sound in both chain of narration and text. However, of the eight
reports which enjoin adhering to the family of the Prophet (g)
alongside the noble Qur'an, not one of them is free of some weakness
in the chain of
The texts of these reports say that the
Qur'an and Ah1 al-Bayt will never separate until they come to the
Messenger of Allah (B)at the reservoir, and because of this, it is
essential to adhere to both. In fact, the reality is contrary to these
reports. Some of the supporters (Shia) of Ah1 alBayt went astray and
led others astray. Most of the groups that plotted against Islam and its
people found in Shiism and love for Ah1 al-Bayt a screen to conceal
and protect them, and you may fmd that some of those who claim to
be descendants of Ah1 al-Bayt encourage them for worldly interests,
such as taking one-fifth from the wealth acquired by their followers.

(e)

Avoiding going astray can only he achieved by adhering to the
Qur'an and Sunnah. If Ahl al-Bayt adhere to both, then they have

both the virtue of descent [from the Prophet (@)I and the virtue of
adherence (to the Qur'an and Sunnah), and deserve to be leaders of
guidance whose example we follow, as Allah (&) says: (And make
us leaders of the Muttaqoon [the
(Qur'an 25: 74). This means
leaders who follow the example of those who came before us, and
whose example will be followed by those who come after us. This is
not limited to Ah1 al-Bayt; rather it applies to all who adhere to the
Qur'an and Sunnah. In the case of reports with chains of narration
that were classed as weak, the text itself does not make sense either,
and this is a further weakness. Despite all that, even if these reports
were sound, that would not offer any proof at all for the imamate of
the twelve or their entitlement to the caliphate.534
The great scholar al-Manniwi said in Fiqh Riwriycit alffadeeth: ''If you follow the commands of His Book and heed its
prohibitions, and follow the guidance and example of my family, you
will he guided and will not go astray."535
Ibn Taymiyah said, after stating that this hadith is weak and
cannot he sound: "A number of scholars responded with a comment
indicating that Ah1 al-Bayt would never agree on misguidance. They
said: 'We say that as al-Qi@ Abu Ya'la and others said it."' He also
said: "The consensus of the Ummah is binding proof on the basis of
the Qur'an and Sunnah and scholarly consensus. Ah1 al-Bayt are part
of the Ummah, so if there is consensus among the Ummah, it implies
that there is consensus among Ahl a l - ~ a ~ t . " ~ ~ ~
The hadith of the two weighty matters is the report in which
the Prophet
said: "I am leaving behind among you that which, if
you adhere to it, you will never go astray after I am gone: the Book of
Allah and my family."537 There is some discussion as to whether it is
sound and can be proven to be from the Prophet (g).
What is proven
in Saheeh Muslim is that the command was to adhere to the Book of
Allah, and the instruction was to show respect and kindness to Ah1 al-

(a)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

413

Bayt, as we have seen in the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam in Muslim.
The Prophet (B)
enjoined adherence to the Book of Allah, then he
said: "And the people of my household. I remind you of Allah with
regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with
regard to the people of my household, I remind you of Allah with
regard to the people of my household." What he enjoined was
adherence to the Qur'an. With regard to Ah1 al-Bayt, the Prophet (g)
enjoined taking care of them and giving them their rights, which had
been granted to them by Allah (&).538
The refutation of the distorted Shiite understanding of the
hadith of the two weighty matters is as follows:
(a) A man's family are the members of his household, and the family
of the Prophet @) are those to whom zak% was forbidden. They
are Banu Hiishim, who are the family of the Prophet (@J. The
R Z & s have no chains of narration going back to the Messenger
(g),
and they admit that they have no chains of narration for the
narrations in their books. Rather they are books that they found
and said: "They narrated it, so it must be true."539 As for their
chains of narration, as al-Hurr al-'Amili and other R Z d i Shiite
scholars said: "The Shia have no chains of narration at all, and
they do not rely on chains of narration."540 So how can they
prove what they narrated in their books from the family of the
Prophet (g)?
Rather it is Ah1 as-Sunnah (the Sunnis) who were
the followers of the family of the Prophet (g)
and respected their
rights, and did not add or subtract anything, since the Prophet
(g)
said concerning himself: "Do not praise me as the Christians
praised 'Eesa the son of Maryam; rather say: The slave of Allah
and His ~ e s s e n g e r . " ~ ~ '
(b) The leader of the family of the Prophet (gJwas 'Ali ibn Abi
T a b (&), and after him in knowledge comes Abdullah ihn
'Ahbiis, who was the scholar of the Ummah and who believed in

the caliphate of Abu Bakr and 'Umar before 'Ali (&). In fact, it
is proven in mutawgtir reports that 'Ali (&) said: "The best of
the people after the Messenger of AUah (&)are Abu Bakr and
mar."^^^ So 'Ali (&) affirmed the superiority of the two
shaykhs (Abu Bakr and 'Umar), even though he was the head of
the family of the Prophet (@)?43
(c) This hadith is like the hadith in which the Prophet (g)said: "I
am leaving behind among you that which, if you adhere to it,
you will never go astray: the Book of Allah and my ~ u n n a h . " ~ ~ ~
The Prophet also said: "You must adhere to my Sunnah and the
way of the Rightly Guided Caliphs after me; hold on firmly to
it,"545
He enjoined clinging firmly to it and said: "Follow the
example of those who come after me: Abu Bakr and mar."^^^
He also said: "Follow the guidance of 'Amm&, and adhere to the
advice of Ibn ~ a s ' o o d . "This
~ ~does
~ not refer to imamale at all;
rather it indicates that these people were following the guidance
of the Messenger (g).
Similarly, the family of the Messenger
(g)
can never agree upon misguidance.548
(d) The RSfidi Shia undennine the status of a l - ' ~ b b b ?his
~ ~son
AbduUah and the sons of al-Hasan, by saying that they were
jealous of the sons of al-Husayn. They also undennine the status
of the sons of al-Husayn himself, apart from those who they
claim were Imams, such as Zayd ibn ' ~ l i . ~They
~ ' also
undermine the status of Ibraeem, the brother of al-Hasan al' ~ s k a r i ? ~and
' others. As such, they are not supporters of the
Prophet (@J and his family; the supporters of the Prophet and
his family are those who praised them and respected their rights,
and did not undermine their
(e) How the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
understood the text. The Companions (4)
understood that
what was meant was love, support and obedience. Hence they

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

415

expressed their obedience and respect to the leader of Ah1 alBayt, 'Ali ibn Abi r i b , by calling him 'our mawla'. It was
narrated that R i y q alH%ith said "Some people came to 'Ali in
ar-Rawah and said: 'Peace be upon you, 0 our mawla.' He said:
'How can I be your mawla when you are Arabs?' They said: 'We
heard the Messenger of Allah (&) say on the day of Ghadeer
Khumm: "If I am a person's mawla, 'Ali is also his mawla.""'
Riy* said: "When they left, I followed and asked: 'Who are
these people?' They said: 'Some of the An&, among whom was
Abn Ayyoob a l - ~ n s i k i . " ' ~ ~ ~
The most important thing we learn from this hadith is that 'Ali
ibn Abi Tilib (&)
, ., himself did not understand the word 'mawla'
as referring to imamate and rulership. It may be noted that Amir
al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) found it strange that they called him
'our mawla'. If Amir at-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), who was an Arab
and had a good command of the language, thought it was
synonymous with 'Amir' (ruler) or 'Imam' (caliph), why would
he find it strange that the people were calling him by this title?554

(0 The hooks of the Twelver Sbia narrated some reports of Ah1 alBayt in which they denied that what is meant in the hadith of
Ghadeer Khumm is the imamate or rulership of 'Ali (&) after
the Messenger of Allah (g).
It was said to Imam al-Husayn ibn
'Ali, who was the leader of the descendants of 'Ali (&) at his
time, the appointed heir of his father and the one who was in
charge of his grandfather's charity: "Didn't the Messenger of
Allah say 'If I am a person's mawla, 'Ali is also his mawla"'?
He said: "Yes indeed, hut the Messenger of Allah (g)
did not
mean thereby imamate and rnlership. If he had meant that, he
would have said it clearly to them." His son, Imam Abdullah,
said: "We do not have any right concerning this issue (rnlership)
that no one else has, and there is no one among Ah1 al-Bayt who

416

'Ali's anitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

is appointed by Allah as an Imam (rnler) whom everyone should
obey." He denied that the imamate or caliphate of 'Ali (&) was
on the instrnction of Allah (+~g)."'If these are the wordd of Ahl
al-Bayt, and they are the descendants and supporters of 'Ali
(&), what do you think others should say?556

2. The hadith about 'Ali (&) being appointed i n charge
of Madinah w h e n the Prophet (g)went to Tahook
The campaign to Tabook tookplace in Rajab 9 AH. This was a
very important event in the life of the Prophet (g),
in which he
achieved goals that had a far-reaching effect on the Muslims and the
Arabs, and on the course of Islamic history.557 The Messenger of
Allah (@) appointed 'Ali (&)
in charge of Madinah, and the
,.
hypocrites found an opportunity to express what was in their hearts of
resentment and hypocrisy. They started talking about 'Ali (&) in
offensive terns, such as saying: "He [meaning the Prophet (@)I only
left him behind because he finds him burdensome." This talk about
him on their part was a clear and prominent sign of their bypocrisy.
According to the sound hadith, 'ALi (&) said: "By the One Who
split the seed and created the soul, the unlettered Prophet (
g)
affirmed to me that no one loves me except a believer, and no one
hates me except a
At that point, he went and caught up with the army and wanted
to go on the campaign with them. He said: "0 Messenger of Allah,
why did you leave me behind with the children and women?" The
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "Does it not please you to be to me like
Haroon was to Moosa, except that there is no Prophet after me?"559
There is nothing in this hadith to support what the Shia understand
from it, that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ihn Ahi T%b (&) was the
That view may he refuted
successor of the Messenger of Allah (g).
in several ways:

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

41 7

There is an important reason for this hadith, and we should not
try to understand the hadith without looking at that reason. The
hypocrites had criticised 'Ali (&), so the Messenger of Allah (g)
explained his status and virtue and proved that the hypocrites were
telling lies.

(m);

(s)

died before Moosa
It is proven that Haroon
therefore, quoting this hadith as evidence for the imamate of 'Ali
after the Messenger of Allah is not valid. If the Messenger of Allah
(g)
had wanted to appoint 'Ali ibn Abi Taih (&) as his heir, he
would have said to him for example: "You are to me like Joshua to
Moosa," because the Prophet of Allah Joshua
became the
leader of the children of Israel after the death of Moosa
However, the Messenger of Allah (g)
mentioned Haroon
who
was Moosa's deputy while Moosa was alive, not after he died. This
can only mean one thing, which was that he wanted to calm 'Ali (&)
down, as he was upset because the Messenger (g)
had left him
behind in Madinah to be in charge of the weak, the women and
children and those who had stayed behind from the campaign. The
Prophet (@) explained to him that just as Moosa
had left his
brother Haroon
in charge of his people when he went to Sinai to
meet his Lord (&), the Prophet's leaving 'Ali (&) behind was of
the same nature. Moosa did not leave Haroon behind because he
thought little of him or to undermine his status; he did it because he
tmsted him, and this was also the case with 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&).

Haroon
was not the appointed heir of Moosa
he
was a Prophet and a helper, according to the text of the Qur'an.
Making an analogy with Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), who
according to the Shia was an appointed heir and not a Prophet, is an

418

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

analogy with a difference, although they reject the concept of
analogy in the first place.

Citing as evidence the fact that Haroon (,%) was a helper to
Moosa
in order to demonstrate that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&) was a helper to the Messenger of Allah (g)
is even stranger
than the previous example. That is because Allah (s),
Who made
Haroon (,&%) a helper to His Prophet Moosa
mentioned in His
Book the request of Moosa
(And appoint for me a helper from
my family, Hkoon [Aaron], my brother. Increase my strength with
him, And let him share my task [of conveying Allah's Message and
prophethood].) (Qur'an 20: 29-32)

(m)

(m):

(m),

Do those who think that the two cases are identical believe that
'Ali (&) was a partner with the Messenger of Allah (g)
in his
prophethood, as was the case when Haroon (!@) shared the task of
Moosa (,=)? Whoever believes that is undoubtedly a disbeliever
who is beyond the pale of slam.^^^

At other times, the Prophet (g)
appointed people other than
'Ali ihn Ahi Tilib , .. to he in charge of Madinah. During the
campaign of Badr, he appointed Abdullah ihn Umm Maktoom;
during the campaign of Sulaym, he appointed Sihi' ibn 'Urfafah alGhif2ri or Ibn Umm Maktoom, according to different opinions;
during the campaign of as-Saweeq, he appointed Basheer ibn
'Abdul-Mundhir, during the campaign of Banul-Musaliq, he
appointed Ahu Dharr al-Ghifiki; during the campaign of
Hudaybiyah, he appointed Numaylah ibn Abdullah al-Laythi,
whom he also appointed during the campaign of Khaybar; during
'Urnrat al-Qada', he appointed 'Uwayf ihn al-Adbat ad-Dayli; during
the conquest of Makkah, he appointed Kulthoom ihn Husayn ihn

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

419

'Utbah al-Ghif22, and during the Farewell Pilgrimage, he appointed
Abu Dhujkah. This was stated by Ibn Hishim in various places in
his biography of the Prophet (g).561
Moreover, appointing 'Ali in
charge of Madinah (on this occasion) was not the last time this was
done. During the Farewell Pilgrimage, the Prophet (&J appointed
someone other than 'Ali to be in charge of Madinah. This was the
Prophet's way of training leaders, as when he appointed Abu Bakr in
charge of the hajj. Abu Bakr was also the only one whom he asked to
lead the people in prayer.56z

The Prophet's likening 'Ali to Haroon was an honour, just as
the Prophet (g)
likened Abu Bakr and 'Umar to people greater than
Haroon. During the battle of Badr, when the issue of prisoners of war
arose, the Prophet (s)
., consulted Abu Bakr, who thought that he
should pardon them and let their people ransom them. 'Umar, on the
other hand, thought that they should be executed. The Prophet (g)
said to Abu Bakr (&):
. . "Your likeness is that of Ibfieem ( m ) on
the day when he said: (But whoso follows me, he verily, is of me.
And whoso disobeys me, still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most
Merciful# (Qur'an 14: 36); and your likeness is the likeness of 'Eesa
(js)
when he said: (Lf You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if
You forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All-Mighty, the
AH-Wise) (Qur'an 5: 118)." Then he turned to 'Umar (&) and said:
"0 'Umar, your likeness is the likeness of Noob ( m ) when he said:
(My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers on the earth!# (Qur'an
71: 26); and your likeness is the likeness of Moosa
when he
said: (Our Lord! Destroy their wealth, and harden their hearts, so that
they will not believe until they see the painful torment.) (Qur'an lo:

88),r563

The Prophet (g)
likened Abn Bakr to Ibr&eem and 'Eesa,
and he likened 'Umarto Nooh and Moosa. These are all 'Messengers

of strong will', and they are the best of mankind after the Messenger
of AUah (g);
they are also superior to Haroon by several degrees
(may the blessings and peace of Allah be upon them all). Therefore
the Prophet's likening 'Ali to Haroon was an honour to him, just as
the Prophet (g)
honoured Ahu Bakr and 'Umar when he likened
them to Ibriheem and 'Eesa, and Moosa and Nooh (peace he upon

2.g. Comments of the scholars on the hadith
An-Nawawi said: "There is no proof in this hadith for any of
them; rather it confirms the virtue of 'Ali, hut there is no indication in
it that he is better than anyone else or like anyone else, and there is no
indication in it that he is to he appointed caliph after him, because the
Prophet (g)
only said that to 'Ali when he left him in charge in
Madinah during the campaign to Tahook. This is supported by the
fact that Haroon, to whom he likened him, was not the successor of
Moosa; rather he died during Moosa's lifetime, approximately forty
years before the death of Moosa, according to what is well known
from the accounts narrated by the storytellers, who said that he was
only appointed to be in charge when Moosa went to speak with his
Lord at the time and place appointed by ~ i m . " ~ ~ ~
Ibn Hazm (may AUah have mercy on him) said, after
mentioning the R2fi&s' quoting this hadith as evidence: 'This does
not indicate that he is superior to others or that he was entitled to the
caliphate after him, because Haroon did not take charge of the
children of Israel after Moosa ( m ) died; rather the one who took
charge after Moosa ( m ) died was Joshua, the servant of Moosa and
his companion, who travelled with him to seek al-Khi& ( m ) .
Similarly, the one who took charge after the Messenger of Allah (g)
died was the one who had been hjs companion in the cave, who
travelled with him to Madinah. Since we know that 'Ali was not a
prophet, unlike Haroon who was a prophet, and Haroon was not a

'Ali ibn Abi Tdlib

421

successor who was to lead the children of Israel after the death of
Moosa, then it is true to say that the way in which he was to the
Messenger of Allah ( g ) as Haroon was to Moosa was only in terms
of being closely related. Moreover, the Messenger of Allah ( g ) only
said this to him when he appointed him in charge of Madinah during
the campaign to Tahook; before and after that, he (g)
appointed men
other than 'Ali in charge of Madinah when he travelled. So it is true
to say that this appointment did not mean that 'Ali (&) was superior
to others or that he was to he the ruler after him, jist as it did not
mean that for the others who were appointed."566
Ibn Hajar said: "They quoted this hadith to prove that 'Ali
(&), and no one else among the Companions, was entitled to the
caliphate, because Haroon was the successor to Moosa. My response
to that is that Haroon was not the successor of Moosa except during
his lifetime (when he acted as his deputy), and not after Moosa's
death, because he died before Moosa, according to consensus. That
was referred to by a l - ~ h a t J ; h i . " ~ ~ ~
Ibn Taymiyah said, refuting the RZ& Shia's use of this hadith
as evidence: "If a person says this is like that, or this is akin to that,
likening one to the other, this has to he understood in the right
context; it does not mean that they are equal or identical in all ways.
This is how we should understand it in this case, where 'Ali is
described as being like Haroon. This appointment as deputy in charge
of Madinah is not something unique to 'Ali; actually, this
appointment was not at the same level as other cases when the
Messenger of Allah (g)appointed others to he in charge of
Madinah, let alone better than it. Indeed, people to whom 'Ali was
superior were left in charge during many campaigns, but these
appointments did not mean that these people were superior to 'Ali
(&) even if 'Ali stayed behind too. How can that mean that the
person is superior to 'Ali (&) when more than one person was

appointed in charge of Madinah? Were those who were appointed
also, in relation to the Messenger of Allah (B),
like Haroon was to
Moosa, because their appointments were like 'Ali's? Those
appointments were over people who were greater in number and
more prominent than those over whom 'Ali (&) was appointed at
the time of Tabook, and the need to appoint someone in charge was
greater, because the Prophet (@) was afraid that his enemies might
attack Madinah. By the time of the Tabook campaign, the Arabs of
the Hijaz had become Muslim, Makkah had been conquered and
Islam had prevailed. Hence Allah (s)
commanded His Prophet to go
out on campaign, and he did not leave any fighters with 'Ali (&I, as
he used to do during all other campaigns; instead he took all the
fighters with him."568
2.h. The wisdom behind the Prophet's
not singling out a specific person to
take charge of the Ummah after him

a)

The reason why the Messenger of Allah
did not single out
anyone to take charge of the Ummah after him becomes clear when
we understand the reality of Islam as a divinely-revealed religion. If
the Messenger (g)
had appointed a man to mle after him, that would
have given legitimate justification for people to claim -as they did
without any evidence - that the right to leadership belonged to one
particular family, and this hereditary mlership would have become
the custom in Islam. However, the ~ e s s e n ~of
e rAllah (@) - who
did not speak on the basis of his whims and desires hut only a
Revelation revealed569- wanted to leave this matter completely to
the Muslims to choose the one who was the most suited and the best
of them. He gave some hints referring to Abu Bakr (&), and he
could have stated that clearly, hut he did not do so for this reason;
hinting does not give legitimacy for appointing him immediately
after his death. If there had been any instruction appointing a specific

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

423

person, there could not have been any difference of opinion in the
meeting in Saqeefah at the beginning. Abn Bakr (&) would not
have consulted the people with regard to appointing 'Umar (&),
'Umar (&) would not have left the matter to be decided by the
Muhsjireen, and so on. If it were the case that the matter was
hereditary, Banu Hbhim would have been the most entitled to it.570
This religion is for all of mankind, and it is not right under any
circumstances for it to be limited to one ruling family or to remain
hereditary, like property. Even though that happened in subsequent
eras, such as those of the Umayyads and the Abbasids and others, it is
contrary to Shaia principles. Whatever is contrary to Sharia
principles is alien to the religion of Allah (&), and such flawed
concepts should be eliminated completely from Islamic thought so
that it might be restored to its pure and correct state.571
The following are some of the weak and fabricated hadiths that
the Imamis quote as evidence.

1. The hadith of the bird
One of the most important texts that the Imami Shia quote as
evidence is the hadith of the roasted bird. Al-H&m narrated in alMustadrak that Anas ibn M2kk (&) said: "I used to serve the
Messenger of Allah (g).
A roasted chicken was offered to the
Messenger of Allah (g),
and he said: '0 Allah, bring me the dearest
of Your creation to You so that he can eat this bird with me.' I said:
'0 Allah, make him one of the An&.' 'Ali (&) came, and I said:
'The Messenger of Allah (g)
is busy.' Then he came (again), and the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'Open the door.' He came in, and the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: 'What kept you, 0 'Ali?' He said:
'This is the third time that Anas sent me back; he said that you were
busy.' The Prophet (g)
said: 'What made you do that?' I said: '0
Messenger of Allah, I heard your supplication, and I wanted it to be a

424

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

man from among my people.' The Messenger of Allah (g)
said:
'Any man loves his people."'572
This hadith was narrated via a number of chains of narration,
none of which is free from flaws. Moreover, there are many (similar)
reports with chains of narration going back to Anas (&), and the fact
that none of these chains of narration is sound is something
astonishing. Why did the companions of Anas not narrate this hadith,
when they accompanied him for many years? We have not seen even
one of them narrate this hadith, and they are known for their
trustworthiness and accuracy. People such as d-Hasan al-Ba~ri,
Thibit al-Banhi, Humayd at-Taweel, Habeeb ibn Abi Thibit, Bakr

Abdullah ibn Abi Tabah, A b h ibn Saih, Ibr2heem ibn Maysarah
narrated from Anas, as well as many others who are not known.
Ibn Katheer said: 'Then I came across a large volume by d Q2di Abu Balcr al-Bgqillhi proving that it (the hadith of the bird) is
rejected and weak in terms of both its chain of narration and its
text."573 Ibn alJawzi said: "Ibn Mardawayh narrated it via twenty
chains of narration, all of which are weak or flawed and have
something wrong with them, so he did not think there was any need
to discuss it in detail."574 Ibn Taymiyah said: "The hadith of the bird
is one of the false and fabricated reports, according to the scholars
who know about transmission of reports and chains of narration."575
Az-Zayla'i said: "How often one finds hadiths that were narrated by
so many and have so many chains of narration, yet they are
weak."576

2. The hadith of the house
Another of the hadiths that the Twelver Sbia quote as evidence
that 'ALi (&) was named as the successor of the Prophet (g)
is the
hadith of the house. The Shia think that the Messenger of Allah (@)
appointed 'Ali (&) as the Imam from the outset of his mission, from

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

425

the time he began calling the disbelievers of Makkah to Islam and
asking them to abandon idols and worship Allah
alone.

(s)

According to this hadith, 'Ali (&) said: "When the verse
dAnd wam your tribe [O Muhammad] of near kindred8 (Qur'an 26:
214) was revealed to the Messenger of Allah
he called me and
said: '0 'Ali, Allah has commanded me to warn your tribe of near
kindred. I felt anxious about that, and I thought that if I started telling
them about this matter, I would see from them something that I would
not like, so I kept quiet until Jibreel
came to me and said: "0
Muhammad, unless you do what you are instructed to do, your Lord
will punish you." So make a $a^' [a measurement roughly equivalent
to three kilograms, or four times the volume of a muddl of food for us
and put a leg of mutton on it, and fill a vessel with milk for us, then
call Banu 'Abdul-Mumlib for me so that I may speak to them and
convey what I have been instructed to convey.' So I ('Ali) did what
he told me, then I called them for him. At that time, they were forty
men, more or less, among whom were his maternal uncles Abu T%b,
Hamzah, al-'Abbss and Abu Lahab. When they had gathered with
him, he called me to bring the food that I had made for them, and I
brought it. When I put it down, the Messenger of Allah (g)
picked
up a piece of meat and tore it apart with his teeth, then he spread it
throughout the platter and said: 'Take in the name of Allah.' The
people ate until they were full, and I could not see anything but the
imprint of their hands. By Allah in whose hand is my soul, all of them
ate their fill, even though one man could have eaten everything that
was on the plate. Then he said: 'Give the people to drink.' So I
brought that vessel and they drank until they had all drunk their fill
by Allah, even though one man could have drunk it all.

departed, and the Messenger of Allah did not speak to them. He said:
'Tomorrow, 0 'Ali (we will do the same thing). This man spoke first;
you heard what he said, and the people departed before I could speak
to them. Prepare for us the same food as before, then gather them to
me.' So I did that, and I gathered them together. Then he called for
the food, and I brought it to them, and he did the same as he had done
the day before. They ate until they were full, then he said: 'Give them
to drink.' So I brought that vessel, and they drank until they had all
drunk their fill.

has commanded me to call you to Him. Which of you will support me
in this matter and be my brother and my appointed heir and my
successor among you?' ('ALi said:) All of them refrained, but I -and
I was the youngest of them, with the bleariest eyes, biggest belly and
thinnest legs577- said: '0 Messenger of Allah, I will he your
supporter in this matter.' He took hold of my neck and said: 'This is
my brother, my appointed heir and my successor among you; listen to
him and obey.' The people started laughing and saying to Abu Taih:
He has commanded you to listen to your son and obey him."
According to another version: "No one responded to him. but
'Ali (&) stood up and said: 'I will, 0 Messenger of Allah.' He said:
'Sit down.' Then he repeated it to the people a second time, and they
kept quiet, but 'Ali stood up and said: 'I will, 0 Messenger of Allah.'

This hadith is false in terms of both its chain of narration and
its text. As for its chain of n m t i o n , it includes 'Abdul-Ghaff2r ibn

'Ali ibn Abi Talib

427

al-Qisim and Abdullah ibn 'Abdul-Quddoos. As for 'Abdul-Ghaffir
ibn al-Qhim, he is unreliable and his hadiths are rejected; he cannot
be quoted as evidence. 'Ali ibn al-Madeeni said concerning him: "He
fabricated hadith." Y&ya ibn Ma'een said: "He is nothing."579
'Abbh ibn Y&ya narrated: "He is nothing." Bukhari said: "He is not
strong according to them" - meaning the scholars who examined
the soundness of narrators. Ibn H i b b h said concerning him: "He
alters reports, and it is not permissible to quote him as evidence." He
was rejected by M m a d ibn Hanbal and Y&ya ibn Ma'een. hNasPi said: "His hadith is to be rejected."580 Abdullah ibn 'AbdulQuddoos is no better than his predecessor; his hadith is to be rejected
as well, according to the majority of hadith scholars. An-NasPi said:
"He is not trustworthy." Ad-Diraquai said: "He is weak."581
With regard to the text of the hadith, it is clearly false for a
number of reasons, namely:
2.a. This report is contrary to another report, which the scholars of
hadith are agreed is sound and proven. It was narrated by
Bukhari and Muslim in their collections of sound hadiths from
Ibn 'AbbL (&) that he said: "When the verse 4And warn your
tribe [0 Muhammad] of near kindred) (Qur'an 26: 214) was
revealed, the Prophet
ascended the hill of SafZ and started
calling out: '0 Banu
0 Banu 'Adiy,' calling the clans of
Quraysh until they gathered. Those who could not come
themselves sent their messengers to see what was there. Abu
Lahab and other people from Quraysh came, and the Prophet
(@) said: 'If I told you that there was an army in this valley
marching to attack you, would you believe me?' They said:
'Yes; we have never known you to be anything but truthful.' He
said: 'I am a Warner to you of impending severe punishment.'
Abu Lahab said: 'May your hands perish for the rest of the day!
Is it for this that you called us together?' Then it was revealed:

FA,

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

BPerish the two hands of Abu Lahab [an uncle of the Prophet]
and perish he! His wealth and his children will not benefit him!B
(Qur'an Ill: 1-2)"582
2.b. Tbe Twelver Shia always claim that there is a clear text stating
should be the caliph, and that he is the rightfully
that 'Ali(4)
appointed heir and the only one who desewed this position.
They claim that the texts support one another to confirm that.
However, this hadith proves their view to be flawed because in
it, the Prophet (g)
called these people to support him and said
that whoever agreed to support him would become his brother,
appointed heir and successor after he was gone. He did not
single out 'Ali (&) for that; in fact, he overlooked him three
times, and only when he did not find any other supporter did he
say to him what he said. This indicates that the Prophet (g)
did
not think that 'Ali (&) desenred the position at first, but that he
accepted him in the ;ole because he had no other choice after his
people refused. Is this in accordance with what they claim, that
'Ali (&) was divinely appointed to this position?583
3. The hadith, "I am the city of knowledge, and
'Ali is its gate..." and other fabricated hadiths

There are very many fabricated hadiths of this type. Jiibir ibn
Abdullah narrated from the Prophet (g)
that he said: "I am the city of
knowledge, and 'Ali is its gate." This report is flawed, and it was
rejected by Bukhari. Yahya ibn Ma'een said concerning it: "It has no
basis." Ibn al-Jawzi quoted it in al-Mawdoo'6t (The Fabricated).
An-Nawawi and adh-Dhahabi said: "It is fabricated."584 Al-Albini
said: "The hadith, 'I am the city of knowledge, and 'Ali is its gate, so
whoever desires knowledge let him come to the gate' is fabricated. It
was narrated by d-'Aqeeli in ad-Du'afa', by Ibn 'Adiy in al-Kemil,
by at-Tabarini in al-Kabeer and by d-H%im from Ibn 'Abbiis. Ibn
'Adiy and a l - H Z m also narrated it from Jiibir (&)."585

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

429

The same may be said of the hadith, "Whoever opposes 'Ali's
caliphate is a disbeliever." There is no trace of this whatsoever in the
books of Ah1 a s - ~ u n n a hThese
. ~ ~ ~examples highlight the weakness
of the reports on which the RZdis rely as evidence to prove that 'Ali
(&) was singled out and exclusively appointed as caliph. Ibn
Khaldoon supported this when he said that the texts quoted and
narrated by the R%fi@iShia, which they interpret in ways that support
their views, are not known to the prominent scholars of the Sunnah or
narrators of hadith; most of them are fabricated or flawed in their
chains of narration or have nothing to do with the interpretations
given to them.587What Ibn Hazm said, that all the hadiths to which
the Rsfitfidisadhere are fabricated, is something that anyone with the
slightest knowledge of hadith and how the reports were narrated
The Shiite writer Ibn Abi al-Hadeed acknowledged the role of
the Shia in fabricating hadiths to support their view regarding
imamate. He said: "The original lies in the hadiths about the virtues
(of 'Ali) were all started by the Shia, because they initially fabricated
different hadiths about 'Ali, motivated by their grudges against their
opponents. When the Bakris (meaning some of the Sunnis) saw what
the Shia had done, they fabricated hadiths in favour of Abu Balcr, in
response to these hadiths (about 'Ali). Then when the Shia saw what
the Bakris had done, they went to extremes in fabricating hadiths.
The two parties need not have done all that, because there are proven,
sound reports about the virtues of 'Ali and the virtues of Abn Balcr,
which are well established and known, which meant that there was no
need for all of this extremism."589
Despite the weakness of this evidence, we find that some of
the contemporary Shia are still repeating it in their books and quoting
it to prove their beliefs about imamate. One of them is of the view
that the Messenger (g)
would not have been regarded as having

430

'Ali's altitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

conveyed the message if he did not appoint 'Ali to be the caliph after
him.590 He says: "Allah spoke to the noble Messenger through
revelation, telling him to convey what Allah had sent down to him
with regard to who was to succeed him in running the people's
affairs. Because of this instrnction, he conveyed what he was
commanded to do and he appointed Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali to be
the caliph."591 This view of theirs is contrary to the verses and
hadiths they quote as evidence for imamate, because the implication
of this view is that until the incident of Ghadeer Khumm, Allah
and His Messenger (@) did not mention 'Ali (&)by name to be the
Imam.

(s)

It is sufficient criticism of the Shias' imamate theory to note
that they have no proof for it except the words of Abdullah ibn Saba'.
He was the Jew who started spreading the idea that imamate was
based on instructions from the Prophet (g)
and was limited to the
one mentioned by the revelation, and that if anyone else took charge
of it, he should be disavowed and regarded as a disbeliever. The
books of the Shia admit that lhn Saba' was the first one to spread the
idea that the imamate of 'Ali was obligatory and to express disavowal
of his enemies, stand up to his opponents and regard them as
disbelievers.592He was of Jewish origin and thought that Joshua
(>B)
was the appointed heir of Moosa (=I, so when he became
Muslim, he applied this idea to 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&).593

3.4. Tawheed and the Twelver Shia
The Shia regard belief in the Imam as a foundation of their
madh-hab and one of the pillars of their faith. In their view, the Imam
is part of belief, and they attribute to one of their Imams the idea that
whoever of this Ummah has no Imam to follow will go astray and be
lost, and that if he dies in that state, he will have died a death of
j ~ h i l i ~ ~ That
a h . is~ because
~~
the Imam, according to the Shiite

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

431

concept, is something completely different from the caliph as all
Muslims understand the concept. The Muslims regard the imam
(leader) or caliph of the Muslims as an ordinary person with regard to
his make-up and knowledge, and his role does not go beyond
implementing the laws of Allah
It is possible for him to err or to
deviate, as is possible for all other people, so he must be corrected
and opposed if he goes against the command of Allah (&). Over and
above that, the caliph is to he chosen and elected by the Muslim
community on the basis of consultation.595

(s).

In contrast, the Shia believe that the Imams were lights before
this universe came into heing, and that they have authority over the
universe in addition to their authority as rulers of the people. They
attribute to the Messenger of Allah (g)
a hadith, which they traced
back to 'Ali ihn Ahi T S b (&,).596 One of the contemporary Shiite
imams says: "The fact that the Imam has the proven right to authority
and rulership does not mean giving up his status that he has before
Allah, and it does not make him like other rulers. The Imam has a
high status, sublime position and universal authority whereby all the
atoms of the universe are subject to that authority. One of the
fundamentals of our madh-hah is that our Imams occupy a status that
was not attained by any angel who is close to Allah or any Prophet
who was sent. According to the reports and hadiths that we have, the
greatest Messenger
and the Imams
were lights before this
universe came into existence. Allah placed them surrounding His
throne and bestowed upon them high status and closeness to Him that
no one knows except Allah. Jihreel said, as is narrated in the reports
of the Prophet's ascent to heaven: 'If I come one fingertip closer, I
will be burned.' It was narrated from them (gx)
(that they said): 'We
go through some states of being that no angel who is close to Allah,
and no Prophet who was sent, ever went through."'597

(s)

(a)

According to this concept of the Imam, his role is not limited
to implementing the laws of Allah; he actually has dominion over the

432

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

(4)

affairs and events of the universe. In their view, 'Ali
is the
legitimate, dominant ruler with Sharia authority over the affairs of the
land and the people. The angels submit to him, and the people are
subjugated to him, even his enemies. They are subject to the truth
when he stands and when he sits; when he speaks and when he is
silent; when he delivers speeches, prays and fights.598Because of this
exaggeration, the Shiite belief in the Imams had an impact on their
belief in the Oneness of Allah (tawheed), which may be explained as
follows:

3.4.1. Their interpretation of the texts
on tawheed as referring to the imamate
(authority) of the Imams
The first thing that we find shocking is that they altered the
meaning of the texts of the Qur'an, which enjoin worshipping Allah
(s)alone, to suggest believing in the imamate of 'Ali (&) and the
Imams, and they interpreted the texts which forbid associating
p a e r s with Allah (&)as referring to partners in the authority of the
Imams.
In a l - ~ i i f iwhich
, ~ ~ ~is the soundest of their books in narration;
Tafseer a l - ~ u m m i , 6which
~ ~ is the foremost of their books of
Qur'anic commentary; and other major reference w0rks,6~' the
interpretation of the verse (And indeed it has been revealed to you [ 0
Muhammad], as it was to those [Allah's Messengers] before you: 'If
you join others in worship with Allah, [then] surely, [all] your deeds
will he in vain ...' b (Qur'an 39: 65) is as follows:
"This means: if you associate someone else with him in
imamate."602 In another version, the meaning is: "If yon enjoin the
authority of someone else alongside the authority of 'Ali afteryou [O
Muhammad], then all your deeds will be in vain."603 In his
interpretation of the Qur'an, the author of al-Burhiin quoted four

'Ali ibn Abi Tklib

433

reports of theirs to explain the verse in accordance with the meanings
mentioned above.604With regard to the reason for its revelation, they
said, "When Allah ( B )revealed to His Prophet
that he should
appoint 'Ali to he in charge of the people, Mu'idh ibn Jabal snuck in
and said to him: 'Associate with his authority the first and the second
(refening to Abu Bakr and 'Umar), so that people could accept what
you say and believe you.' But when the verse: (0 Messenger
Muhammad]! Proclaim [the Message] which has been sent down to
you from your LordB (Qur'an 5: 67) was revealed, the Messenger of
Allah complained to Jihreel, saying: 'The people may disbelieve me
and not accept anything from me.' Then Allah (&) revealed the
words $And indeed it has been revealed to you [0Muhammad], as it
was to those [Allah's Messengers] before you: If yon join others in
worship with Allah, [then] surely, [all] your deeds will be in vain...),
(Qur'an 39: 65)"

(s)

In order to understand the extent of their distortion of the
verses of Allah (&) and their conspiracy to change the verse, we
should look at the verse in context to see what comes before and after
it. Allah (@) said: dSay [O Muhammad to the polytheists]: 'Do you
order me to worship other than Allah, 0 you fools?' And indeed it
has been revealed to you [O Muhammad], as it was to those [Allah's
Messengers] before you: 'If you join others in worship with Allah,
[then] surely, [all] your deeds will be in vain, and you will certainly
he among the losers.' Nay! But worship Allah [Alone and none else],
and be among the grateful.), (Qur'an 39: 64-66)
The verse, as is clear from its context, has to do with
worshipping Allah ( B )alone, hut they changed the meaning and
regarded the verse as having to do with 'Ali (&), even though there
is no mention of him in the verse at all. It is as if they regarded him as
the one referred to by the word 'Allah' and they interpreted the word
'worship' as refening to imamate. In reality, the meaning of the verse

434

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

is quite clear, and there is not the slightest connection between its hue
meaning and their interpretation.605
The scholars said, commenting on the meaning of this verse,
"Allah ( g ) commanded His Prophet to say this to the polytheists
when they called him to their religion of idol worship, saying, 'This
is the religion of your forefathers.r r i 6 0 6 What is meant is: "Say, 0
Muhammad, to the polytheists among your people: 'Are you
commanding me to worship gods other than AUah,0 you who are
ignorant of Allah, when worship cannot be directed to anyone other
than Him?" Since the command to worship anyone other than AUah
can only come from one who is ignorant and foolish, He ( B )
gave them a befitting description when he said: do you fools!)
(Qur'an 39: 64) Then Allah ( g ) stated that He had revealed to His
Prophet and to the Messengers before him: "If yon associate anything
or anyone else with Allah (B),
your deeds will be in vain." This is to
highlight the seriousness and abhorrent nature of polytheism; its
seriousness is confirmed by the fact that the warning against it is
addressed to one (namely, the Prophet) who would have nothing to
do with it, so how about others? Then He (@) said: 4Nay! But
worship Allah [Alone and none else]) (Qur'an39: 66).Do not worship
what the polytheists tell you to worship; rather worship Allah
alone, to the exclusion of all other false gods and idols.607

(s)

(s)

As one can see, the meaning is very clear. No one could
misinterpret it except one who has an ulterior motive, whose whims
and desires have bEnded him to the tmth. The main concern of this
group who fabricated these reports, and their only objective, was to
find support for their claim of imamate in the Qur'an, even if that
meant distorting the words of Allah (g).
Thus they distorted the
meaning a great deal, and their interpretation was not based on any
knowledge of Arabic or reason, let alone any religious text. It is also
clear from the report they narrated that they were showing disrespect
towards the Prophet 1%) by depicting him as being scared and afraid

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

435

of his people and hesitant in carrying out the instructions of his Lord,
to the extent that he could not overcome this attitude until the
revelation of a threat that all his deeds would be in vain.608

3.4.2. Their opinion that belief in the imamate
is the basis of deeds being accepted
They said that AUah ( B ) appointed 'Ali (&) to be the Imam
as a sign between Him and His creation: "The one who recognises it
is a believer, and the one who rejectsit is a disbeliever; the one who
does not h o w it is astray, and the one who sets up any rival to him is
a polytheist; the one who comes (on the Day of Judgement) believing
in his imamate will enter paradise."609 They also said: "Whoever
mrms our belief in imamate then dies, his prayer, fasting, zak2h and
hajj will be accepted; but whoever does not affirm our belief in
imamate before Allah (&), He will not accept any of his deeds."610

(m)

They claim that Jibreel
came down to the Prophet (g)
and said: "0 Muhammad, A s - S a l k (a name of Allah that means The
Source of Peace and Perfection) conveys s a l k to you and says: 'I
created the seven heavens and what is in them and the seven earths
and what is on them, and I have not created any place greater than arRukn (the comer of the Ka'bah) and M a q k Ihr&eem. If any slave
calls upon Me there, from the time I created the heavens and the
earths, then he meets Me denying the imamate of 'Ali, I will throw
him in he11."'~"
There are many similar reports; they are all false, and none of
them is sound. All these reports have nothing to do with Islam at all.
We have the Book of AUah ( S ) , which is the final verdict and first
reference point in any dispute; there is nothing of what they claim in
it. The noble Qur'an states that the basic requirement with regard to
deeds is tawheed, and the reason for doom is polytheism. Allah
says: (Verily, whosoever sets up partners [in worship] with Allah,

(s)

436

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

then AUah has forbidden paradise to him, and the fire will be his
abode.) (Qur'an 5: 72)
$Verily, Allah forgives not that patners should be set up with Him
[in worship], but He forgives except that [anything else] to whom He
wills.)
(Qur'an 4: 48)
Everything that we have mentioned here of the exaggerations
of the Shia is proven false by the verses of the Qur'an. Allah (a&)
says: &rely, those who believe [in the Oneness of Allah, in His
Messenger Muhammad and all that was revealed to him from Allah],
and those who are the Jews and the Sabians and the Christians, whosoever believed in Allah and the Last Day, and worked
righteousness, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.)
(Qur'an 5: 69)

The Shia claim that belief in the twelve Imams is more
important than prayer and the other pillars of Islam, but prayer is
mentioned in more than eighty places in the Qur'an, while their belief
in imamate is not mentioned even once. Did Allah want to misguide
His slaves? Did He not explain to them the way to reach Him? Glory
be to You ( 0 Allah)! This is a great lie.612
{And Allah will never lead a people astray, after He has guided them,
until He makes clear to them as to what they should avoid.)
(Qur'an 9: 115)
Among their reports are some that contradict what they said,
but their misinterpretation and concept of taqiyyah led to the burying
alive of these fair and moderate texts. We mention this so that the
wise person may learn a lesson, the heedless person may pay
attention, and the sleeper may wake up, and so as to establish proof
against the stubborn from their own books and point out the
contradictions in their own texts. It says in Tafseer al-Furit that 'Ali
ibn Abi Taib (&) said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (g)
say: "When the verse, BSay [O Muhammad]: No reward do I ask of

I

'Ali ibn Abi TIilib

437

you for this except to be kind to me for my kinship with you%(Qur'an
42: 23) was revealed, Jibreel said: '0 Muhammad, every religion has
a root and foundation, and branches and a structure. The root and
foundation of this religion is saying Lh iliha illi Allrih (There is none
worthy of worship other than Allah), and its branches and structure
are loving you, loving Ah1 d-Bayt, and supporting you in what is in
accordance with the truth and calling others to it."'613
This text differs from what their other reports say; it describes
tawheed, not belief in the imamate, as the basis of religion. It regards
loving Ah1 d-Bayt as one of the branches, which is limited to those
among them who follow the truth and call others to it.614

3.4.3. Their belief that the Imams are t h e
intermediaries between Allah (g)
and H i s creation
The Imami Shia believe that the twelve h a m s are the
intermediaries between Allah and His creation. Al-Majlisi says of his
Imams: "They are the doors to the Lord and the intermediaries
between Him and His creation."615 He wrote a chapter entitled: 'The
people can only be guided through them; they are the intermediaries
between mankind and AUah ( s ) , and no one will enter paradise
except the one who acknowledges them." In 'Aqri'id al-Zmamimah,
it says that the twelve Imams are doors to Allah ( s ) and the way to
Him, they are like the ship of Nooh (@) in that whoever embarks on
it will be saved, and whoever stays away from it will drown.616Some
of the issues that are to be found in their books and reference works,
which emphasise these concepts, include the following:

3.4.3.a. Their belief that people have no guidance
except through the Imams
Abu Ahdullah, according to their claim, said: "The trouble we
have with people is serious. If we call them, they do not respond to
us, but if we leave them, they will not be guided by others."617Their

438

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

reports say: "Abu Ja'far said: 'By means of us, Allah is worshipped;
by means of us, Allah is known; and by means of us, His Oneness is
proclaimed."'618
These texts do not say that the Ummah cannot he guided, but
they make the Imams the source of guidance. In fact, guidance in the
sense of being enabled to know and accept the buth is something that
no one has control over except the Lord of mankind, the Controller of
the hearts and minds, the One who comes in between a person and his
heart,619 the One Who says to a thing, "Be!" and it is.
The Shia, by stating these things in general terms without any
restrictions, give their Imams a role alongside Allah with regard to
the issue of guidance, but Allah (&) is the only One who guides
people, with no partner or associate.620Allah ( B )says: $He whom
Allah guides, he is the rightly-guided; but he whom He sends astray,
for him you will find no Wali [guiding kendl to lead him [to the
Right path]) (Qur'an 18: 17). Allah (&) said to His Prophet (g):
$verily, you [ 0 Muhammad] guide not whom you like, but Allah
guides whom He wills.) (Qur'an 28: 56)
With regard to guidance in the sense of telling people about the
truth and showing them the way to it, this is the role of the
Messengers and those who followed them in truth, and it is not
limited to the twelve Imams. (say [ 0 Muhammad]: 'This is my way;
I invite unto Allah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows
me') (Qur'an 12: 108). Saying that this guidance can only be achieved
through the Imams is insolence towards Allah (&).621
3.4.3.b. Their belief that supplication cannot be
answered except in the names of the Imams
They said that the one whose supplication is not in the name of
the Imams will not prosper and will be doomed. It says in their report
from the Imams: "The one who calls upon Allah in our name will

'Ali ibn Abi TZlib

439

prosper, and the one who calls upon Him in the name of anyone other
than us is doomed and destroyed."62z Their audacity in that regard
went so far that they said: "The supplication of the Prophets was
answered by means of the names of the Imams and seeking their
intercession, may the blessings of Allah he upon them all."623

(s)

This is what the R%@ Shia say and fabricate, hut Allah
says: #And [all] the most beautiful Names belong to Allah, so call on
Him by them) (Qur'an 7: 180). He does not say to call upon Him by
the names of the Imams or the status of the Imams or their shrines.
Auah (%) also says:
(And your Lord said: 'Invoke Me [i.e. believe in My Oneness
(Islamic Monotheism) and ask Me for anything]; I will respond to
yow [invocation]...'b
(Qur'an 40: 60)

If the condition for supplication being accepted was
mentioning the names of the Imams, Allah (%) would have said:
"Invoke Me by the names of the Imams; I will respond to your
(invocation)." Instead, what the Shia claim and fabricate is actually
one of the causes for supplications being rejected and not accepted,
because devoting worship purely to Him alone when calling upon
Him in supplication is the means of having the supplication answered
and accepted. Allah (s)says:
(So, call you [O Muhammad and the believers] upon [or invoke]
Allah making [your] worship pure for Him [Alone] [by worshipping
none but Him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allah's sake
only and not to show off and not to set up rivals with Him in
worship], however much the disbelievers [in the Oneness of Allah]
may hate [it].)
(Qur'an 40: 14)
#And invoke Him only making your religion sincere to Him [by not
joining in worship any partner with Him and with the intention that
you are doing your deeds for Allah's sake anty].) (Qur'an 7: 29)

440

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

These Imams are just like other humans: $Verily, those whom
you call upon besides Allah are slaves like you. So call upon them
and let them answer you if you are truthful.) (Qur'an 7: 194)
Allah (s)
has not appointed any righteous man, angel who is
close to Him, or Prophet who was sent, to be a mediator between Him
and His creation; all are slaves of Allah (&): (The Messiah will
never be proud to reject to be a slave of Allah, nor the angels who are
near [to Allah1.b (Qur'an 4: 172)
$There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most
Gracious [Allah] as a slave.)
(Qur'an 19: 93)
As for the contention that the supplication of the Prophets was
answered by beseeching in the names of the Imams, this is a false
claim. The Prophets called upon Allah by His name, affirming His
Oneness, may He be glorified. The prophet Ayyoob (g)
beseeched
Allah by His beautiful names, affirming that He is the Most Merciful
of those who show mercy:
(And [remember] Ayyoob [Job], when he cried to his Lord: 'Verily,
distress has seized me, and You are the Most Merciful of all those
who show mercy.' So We answered his call, and We removed the
distress that was on him, and We restored his family to him [that he
had lost] and the like thereof along with them as a mercy from
Ourselves and a Reminder for all those who worship Us.)
(Qur'an 21: 83-84)
Yoonus (Dhun-Noon) (Bbeseeched
)
Allah by His Oneness.
AUah (&) says:
$And [remember] Dhun-Noon [Jonah], when he went off in anger,
and imagined that We shall not punish him [i.e. the calamities which
had befallen him]! But he cried through the darkness [saying]: L.6
ilrihri ill6 Anta [none has the right to be worshipped but You ( 0
Allah)], Glorified [and Exalted] be You [above all that (evil) they

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

441

associate with You]! Truly, I have been of the wrongdoers." So We
answered his call, and delivered him from the distress. And thus We
do deliver the believers [who believe in the Oneness of Allah, abstain
(Qur'an 21: 87-88)
from evil and work righteousnessl.8

(m)

Allah ( B )described the words spoken by Adam
and his
wife: $They said: 'Our Lord! We have wronged ourselves. If You
forgive us not, and bestow not upon us Your Mercy, we shall
certaidy be of the losers.') (Qur'an 7: 23)
This idea of the Shia is known to be corrupt on the basis of
Islamic teachings. The books of the Sbia themselves narrate reports
from the Imams that contradict this idea; they describe the Imams
conversing with Allah (&) and calling upon Him. They narrated
many reports, from every Inlam without exception, describing how
he called upon Allah (&) and conversed with Him. Most of these
reports are narrated by al-Majlisi in Bihrir al-~nwBr.~"
3.4.3.c. Their belief that pilgrimage
to their shrines is greater than
pilgrimage to the House of Allah ( B )

Ibn Taymiyah said: "Some people that I trust told me that
among them are those who believe that pilgrimage to the shrines is
greater than pilgrimage to the Ancient House (the Ka'hah), thus they
think that associating others with Allah is greater than worshipping
Allah alone. This is the greatest belief in f a l ~ c h o o d . " ~ ~ ~

It says in al-KBfi and elsewhere: "Visiting the grave of alHusayn is equivalent to twenty hajj pilgrimages and better than
twenty 'umrahs and hajj pilgrimages."626 The fabricated Shiite
reports ascribe a special virtue to visiting the tomb of al-Husayn on
the day of 'Arafah and say, 'Whoever comes to al-Husayn on a day
other than Eid, recognising his status, Allah will record for him
twenty hajj pilgrimages and twenty 'umrahs, blessed and accepted.

442

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Whoever comes to him on the day of Eid, Allah will record for him
twenty hajj pilgrimages and one hundred 'umrahs. Whoever comes
to him on the day of 'Arafah, recognising his status, Allah will record
for him one thousand hajj pilgrimages and one thousand 'umrahs,
blessed and accepted, and one thousand campaigns with a Prophet
who was sent or a just ru~er."~"For these people, visiting the grave
of al-Hnsayn is not only better than hajj; it is the best of deeds. In
their report, it says that visiting the grave of d-Husayn is the best
possible deed.628 According to another report, "One of the most
beloved of deeds is visiting the grave of a l - ~ u s a ~ n . " ~ ~ ~
Thus the laws and commandments of Islam are forgotten, and
attention is paid to graves and tombs. They consider visits to these
places the best of deeds, without any evidence apart from whatever
their imaginations come up with or what is inspired from their satans,
who have instituted for them a religion which Allah (&) has not
ordained.630
These people regard visiting the tombs as one of the obligatory
duties of their reli~ion,
for which they have invented rituals like those
of the hajj pilgrimage to the Sacred House of Allah. Ibn Taymiyah
said: "Their Shaykh Ibn an-Nu'mk, who is known to them as d Mufeed, wrote a book which he called Mancisik al-Mashcihid (The
Rituals of the Shrines). According to it, pilgrimage is performed at
the graves of created beings as it is performed at the Ka'bah, the
Sacred House that Allah has made an asylum of security and benefits
(such as hajj and 'umrah) for mankind631 and the first House (of
worship) appointed for mankind;632no circumambulation is to be
performed except around it, no prayers are to be offered in any
direction except towards it, and no pilgrimage is enjoined except to
it."633 Anyone who looks at the references of the R%@ Shia that
speak of the shrines will see very strange deviations from the Book of
Allah and the guidance of the Messenger (B).
Anyone who wishes to

Xli ibn Abi Tdlib

443

h o w more may refer to the book Ufool Madh-hub ash-Shia al~rnarni~~ah.~~~
The Muslims have one Ka'bah, which they face in their
prayers and supplications, to which they go on pilgrimage and
around which they circumambulate (perform tawif); as for the Shia,
they have the shrines of the dead
What they do at these
shrines has been forbidden by AUah (g)
and His Messenger, and
everything that is forbidden by Allah (&) and His Messenger is
blameworthy and disallowed, whether the one who does it claims to
be Sunni or Shiite. It is well known in the religion of Islam that the
Prophet
did not enjoin the actions that they speak of with regard
to shrines, and he did not prescribe for his Ummah any rituals to be
performed at the graves of prophets and righteous people. That is the
religion of the polytheists, of whom AUah (g)
says: BAnd they have
said: 'You shall not leave your gods, nor shall you leave Wadd, nor
Suwi?', nor Yaghooth, nor Ya 'ooq nor Nasr' [these are the names of
their idols].'B (Qur'an 71: 23)

a)

Ibn 'Abhh and others said about those idols: "These are the
names of righteous men among the people of Nooh
When they
died, Satan inspired their people to set up idols in the places where
they used to sit and to call them by their names. They did that, but the
idols were not worshipped until those people died and knowledge
was lost, then they were worshipped."636 Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
ihn Abi T%b (&) said to Ahu al-Hayij al-Asadi: "Shall I not send
you on the same mission as the Messenger of Allah (g)
sent me?
'Do not leave any image without erasing it or any built-up grave
without levelling it."'637 Some of the Shiite reports affirmed the
same meaning. Al-Kulayni narrated from Abu AbduUah that Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali
said: "The Messenger of AUah (gJsent me to
Madinah and said: 'Do not leave any image without erasing it or any
grave without levelling it."'638 St was narrated that Abu Abdnllah

(m).

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

said: "The Messenger of Allah (g)
forbade praying on graves, sitting
on them, or building strnctures over them."639 It was also narrated
that Abn Abdullah said: "Do not build structures over graves... for
the Messenger of Allah (g)
disliked that."@0 It was narrated from
his forefathers that the Messenger of Allah (SJforbade plastering
over graves.641
Al-Hum d - ' k l i claimed that this prohibition included every
and the Imams
and
grave except the graves of the Prophet (g)
that the prohibition meant only that it was disliked.642However, the
general meaning of these reports is clear, as is the evidence for its
being hah.A l - ' h l i has no evidence for his contention except the
strangeness of the real-life practice of his group and the oddness of
some of their reports. This oddness itself is proof of invalidity
because it is contrary to the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His
Messenger and the consensus of the Ummah, including Ah1 al-Bayt.
A warning against this was narrated from Ah1 d-Bayt, because it is a
means that leads to associating others with Allah. Moreover, the
reason for this prohibition does not differentiate between one grave
and another; in fact, the danger is greater with regard to the graves of
the Imams because the likelihood of people going to extremes with
regard to them is greater. Hence the cause of polytheism is
exaggerating about the righteous.643

(s),

3.4.4. Their belief that the Imam forbids
what he wants and allows what he wants
The Shia claim in their reports that: "Allah (g)
created
Muhammad, 'Ali and Fstimah, and they remained for a thousand
years, then He
created all other things and made these three
witnesses to their creation. He (g)
enjoined His creation to be
obedient to them and delegated the affairs of creation to them, so they
permit what they want and forbid what they want."644Their shaykh

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

445

al-Majlisi interpreted this text as follows: "He enjoined (His creation)
to be obedient to them; in other words, He made it obligatory and a
duty for all things to obey them, even inanimate things such as the
heavens and the earth, like the splitting of the moon, trees moving
towards them, pebbles glorifying Allah (&) and innumerable other
things. He delegated their affairs to them with regard to what is
permitted and what is forbidden, what is given and what is
~ i t h h e l d . "The
~ ~Shia have reports that clearly state this, including
those narrated by al-Mufeed in al-Ikhtifcif,d-Majlisi in al-Bihir and
others, from Abn Ja'far who said: "If we permit something gained by
someone from the wrongdoers,646it is h d 3 , because the Imams are
given authority." Therefore, what they permit is permitted, and what
they forbid is forbidden."'
However, it is well known from the Book of Allah and the
Sunnah of His Messenger (g)
that one of the foundations of tawheed
is the belief that Allah (&)Lone is the Lawgiver Who permits what
He wills and forbids what He wills, and He has no partner or
associate in that. The Messengers of Allah conveyed the laws of
Allah to His slaves, and the one who claims that he has an Imam who
permits what he wants and forbids what he wants is included in the
words of Allah: (Or have they partners with Allah [false gods] who
have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?)
(Qur'an 42: 21)

The right to legislate does not belong to anyone except the
Lord of mankind, and the role of the Messengers is only to convey
from Allah ( s ) ; they do not forbid or permit anything except what
Allah ( s ) enjoins upon them and reveals to them. Allah (g)
says,
concerning the one who follows his leaders in what they permit and
forbid, as opposed to the laws and rulings of Allah: (They [Jews and
Christians] took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides
Allah [by obeying them in things which they made lawful or

446

'Ali's attitude towards the Khariiites and Shia

unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by
Allah]...k (Qur'an 9: 31) Allah
describes their following them in
what they permit of h a r h things and what they forbid of hal2 things
[as is mentioned in the commentary on this verse] as being a kind of
worship of them because the followers received instruction on what
is permitted and what is forbidden on their authority, but this is
something that can only be received from Allah ( z J ~ ) . ~ ~ '

(s)

3.4.5. Their belief that this world and the hereafter
are for the Imam to deal with as he wants
The author of al-K6fi devoted a chapter to this topic entitled
"The entire earth belongs to the ~ r n a m , "in~which
~ ~ it is narrated
from Abn Busayr that Abu Abdullah
said: "Do you not know
that this world belongs to the Imam, to deal with as he wishes and to
give to whom he wishes? That is allowed for him by ~ l l a h . " ~ ~ ~

(m)

This text is polytheism, associating partners with AUah in His
Lordship, because Allah (g)
says: %Knowyou not that it is Allah to
Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth?$ (Qur'an
2: 107)

%Andto AUah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and
all that is between them; and to Him is the return [of all]$
(Qur'an 5: 18)

$To AUah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all
that is therein)
(Qur'an 5: 120)
%Heto Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and
Who has begotten no son [children or offspring] and for Whom there
is no partner in the dominion.)
(Qur'an 25: 2)
%Butto AUah belongs the last bereafter] and the first [the world].$
(Qur'an 53: 25)

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

447

(Say 10 Muhammad to polytheists, pagans]: Who gives you
provision from the heavens and the earth?b
(Qur'an 34: 24)
(So seek your provision from Allah [Alone], and worship Him
[Alone], and be grateful to Him.)
(Qur'an 29: 17)
So Allah is unique in His dominion, provision and control, and He
has no partner in that.651

3.4.6. Their belief that natural phenomena
can be attributed to the Imams
It was narrated that Samii'ah ibn M a h r h said: "I was with Abn
Abdullah, and there was thunder and lightning. Abu Abdullah said:
'Whatever happens of thunder and lightning, it is because of the
command of your companion.' I said: 'Who is our companion?' He
said: 'Amir a l - ~ u ' m i n e e n . " ' ~What
~ ~ he meant was that every time
there is thunder and lightning, it is by the command of 'Ali (&), not
by the command of Allah ( B )the
, One, the Almighty. What could a
fair-minded Muslim conclude from this report, when Allah ( B )says:
(It is He Who shows you the lightning, as a fear [for travellers] and as
a hope [for those who wait for rain]. And it is He Who brings up [or
originates] the clouds, heavy [with water]B (Qur'an 13: lz)? Is this not
Saba'i thought raising its ugly head in the hooks of the Twelvers? Is
this not a claim of divinity for 'Ali (&), or at least a claim that he has
a share in divinity? How dare al-~ajlisi,and al-Mufeed before him,
write such myths and attribute them to Ja'far?
The implications of this report cannot be unknown to people
like them, because no one believes in this or promotes it except a
heretic and one who has gone astray. It is very strange that people
base their religion on books which contain this garbage and venerate
shaykhs who openly preach this heresy. Is there no one among this
group who has reason and piety and who will denounce openly and

448

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

loudly all this widespread misguidance and blatant disbelief, clear the
name of the pure Ah1 al-Bayt of this lethal nonsense, and purify
Shiism of this stain of disbelief and misguidance caused by the
shaykhs of the Safavid state? Or is it the case that whenever a sincere
voice speaks up, they either hasten to kill him, as they did with alKisrawi, or they interpret his words as being taqiyyah, as they did
with many of their reports and words of their shaykhs? Is it now a
hopeless case to call the people of this ma&-hab to the light of
truth?653

3.4.7. Their belief that part of the divine
is incarnated in the Imams
The Imami Shia have some reports claiming that part of the
divine light was incarnated in ' ~ l i . ~Abn
' ~ Abdullah supposedly
said: 'Then he touched us with his right hand, and his light entered
but Allah mixed us with His ~ s s e n c e . They
" ~ ~ claim
~
that the
Imams were given absolute power by means of this part of the divine
that is in them. The one who reads about what they call 'the miracles
of the Imams,' of which there are hundreds of reports, will notice that
the Imams became like the Lord of the Worlds -may He be exalted
and sanctified above what they say - in terms of giving life. and
death, creation and granting provision.657Their reports may add a
comment stating that this was from AUah (B),
by way of deceit. To
prove that this idea is corrupt, it is sufficientjust to try to comprehend
it because it is contrary to the texts, to reason and to the natural laws
of the universe. It can also be proven wrong by the real lives and
statements of the Imams. For one thing, the Shia claim that the Imams
were wronged and persecuted during their lives. For another, the
Messenger of guidance (@) said, as his Lord commanded him: (Say
[0Muhammad]: 'I possess no power over benefit or hurt to myself
except as AUah wills.') (Qur'an 7: 188)

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

449

What is amazing is that the books of the Shia, even though
they exaggerate about the Imams, also narrate things that are
contrary, which illustrates the contradictions in what they preach, as
is the norm in all lies and falsehood. In Rijril al-Kashshi, it says that
Ja'far ibn Muhammad said: "By Allah, we are no more than slaves of
the One who created us and chose us, and we cannot cause any harm
or bring any benefit. If He shows mercy towards us, it is because He
is Merciful, and if He punishes us, it is because of our sins. By Allah,
we have no plea before Allah, and we have no proof that Allah will
let us off. We will die and be buried and be resurrected; we will be
made to stand before Him, and we will be questioned. Woe to them,
what is wrong with them? May Allah curse them, for they have
offended Allah (&) and offended His Messenger (SJin his grave, as
well as Amir al-Mn'mineen ['Ali], Fctimah, al-Hasan, al-Husayn,
'Ali ibn al-Hasan and Muhammad ibn 'Ali (may the blessings of
Allah be upon them). Bear witness that I am a man descended from
the Messenger of Allah (g),
but I have no proof that Allah will let
me off. If I obey Him, He will have mercy on me and if I disobey
Him, He will punish me severely."658
The Shiite shaykhs rationalise such statements by describing
them as examples of taqiyyah. They have led people astray from the
straight path, and the Shiite ma&-hab has become the ma&-hab of
the shaykhs (mullahs), not the ma&-hab of the ~ m a m s . ~ ~ ~

3.4.8. Their belief that the Imams know
what has happened and what will happen,
and that nothing is hidden from them
The author of al-Kij? wrote a chapter on this topic entitled:
'The Imams know what has happened and what will happen, and
nothing is hidden from them,"660 in which he narrated a number of
reports. He wrote another chapter entitled "If the Imams want to

450

'AliS attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

know, they will know,"661 in which he quoted a number of their
hadiths. One of the reports concerning these matters falsely
claims:662"Abn Abdullah said: 'I know what is in the heavens and
what is on earth, I know what is in paradise and what is in hell, and I
know what has happened and what will happen."'663 It was narrated
that Sayf a t - T a m 2 said: "A group of Shia were with Abu Abdullah
(&)in al-Hijr, and he said: 'Is there any spy among us? We looked
right and left and did not see anyone, so we said: 'There is no one
watching us.' He said: 'By the Lord of the Ka'bah' t h r e e times 'if I were standing between Moosa and al-Khidr, I would tell them
that I have more knowledge than them, and I would tell them about
that of which they had no knowledge, for Moosa and al-Khi& (peace
be upon them) were given knowledge of what had happened, but they
were not given knowledge of what is to come until the Hour begins.
However, we inherited a legacy from the Messenger of Allah (g)
and his family."'664
These are some examples of the exaggeration of the RZlfidi
Shia and some of their reports. Exaggeration is the foundation and
origin of their madh-hab, but Allah ( B )has forbidden and warned
against exaggeration because it is contrary to tawheed and forms the
basis of polytheism, in the past and the present. Allah
says:
(Exceed not the limits in your religion [by believing in something]
other than the truthk (Qur'an 5: 77). Ibn Katheer said, commenting on
this verse: "[This means] do not overstep the mark in following the
truth. Do not exaggerate in praising the one whom I instruct you to
respect, to the extent that you go to extremes and elevate him from
prophetbood to divinity as they did with the Messiah; he was one of
the Prophets, but they made him a god alongside Allah (+Jig).That
happened because of following in the footsteps of leaders and
shaykhs who are leaders of misguidance, your predecessors who
went astray before you. {[They] went astray before and misled many,
and strayed [themselves]from the Right Path) (Qur'an 5: 77). In other

(s)

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

451

words, they drifted away from the path of righteousness and
moderation and followed the way of whims and desires and
misguidance."665
Allah (&) also says: 4 0 people of the Scripture [Christians]!
Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allah aught but
the truth) (Qur'an 4: 171). In these two verses, Allah ( B )forbids
going to extremes and going beyond due limits by overstating praise.
This is a clear refutation of the Rzfidi Shia and all those who follow
this path with regard to one whom they venerate. Allah
instructed His Prophet Muhammad (@ to explain to the people that
he had no control over his affairs, that benefit and harm are in the
hand of Allah (g),
and that no one has knowledge of the unseen
except Allah
Who instructed him:

(s)

(s),

(Say [0Muhammad]: 'I don't tell you that with me are the treasures
of Allah, nor [that] I h o w the Unseen; nor do I tell you that I am an
angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.' Say: 'Are the blind and the
one who sees equal? Will you not then take thought?'b (Qur'an 6: 50)
(Say [O Muhammad]: 'I possess no power over benefit or hurt to
myself except as Allah wills. If I had the howledge of the Ghayb
[Unseen], I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth,
and no evil should have touched me. I am but a wamer and a bringer
(Qur'an 7: 188)
of glad tidings unto people who believe.'b
Thus Allah 1%) commanded him to delegate his affairs to
H i n (&) and to tell the people that he had no knowledge of the
unseen, the future or anything of that nature.666All of this deters the
ways that may lead to exaggeration about him (g).
It is a warning to
his Ummah lest they exaggerate about him as the Jews and Christians
exaggerated about their Prophets. If this is the case with regard to the
leader of mankind and the greatest in status before Allah (@), it is
even more appropriate with regard to others.

452

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

This highlights the falseness of the Rifi& claims about the
Imams and especially their belief that they have knowledge of the
unseen and that they know what has happened and what will happen.
They make them partners with Allah in creation and giving life, and
in names and attributes. How can they say that when Allah (B)says
in His noble Book: (No person knows what be will earn tomorrow,
and no person knows in what land he will die.) (Qur'an 31: 34)
%Onthe Day when Allah will gather the Messengers together and say
to them: 'What was the response you received [from men to your
teaching]?' They will say: 'We have no knowledge, verily, only You
are the Al-Knower of all that is hidden [or unseen]') (Qur'an 5: 109)
(Allah knows what every female bears, and by how much the wombs
fall shoa [of their time or number] or exceed.)
(Qur'an 13: 8)
(That is because Allah, He is the Truth, and it is He Who gives life to
(Qur'an 22: 6)
the dead.)
(And with Him are the keys of the Ghayb [all that is hidden], none
knows them but He.)
(Qur'an 6: 59)
%Andto Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and
Allah has power over all things.)
(Qur'an 3: 189)
(Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion; and He is Able to do
all things.)
(Qur'an 67: I)
There are other similar verses coniirming that He alone has
knowledge of the unseen and control over the universe. Whoever
amibutes any of that to created beings has fallen into polytheism by
setting up rivals to Allah (&)in His Lordship and Divinity. How can
he claim to be a Muslim when that is the case? Allah (&) says:
(Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him
[in worship], but He forgives except that [anything else] to whom He
wi1ls.B (Qur'an 4: 48)

I

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

453

%Verily,whosoever sets up partners [in worship] with Allah, then
Allah has forbidden paradise to him, and the fue will be his abode.
And for the Q&?limoon [polytheists and wrongdoers] there are no
helpers.)
(Qur'an 5: 72)
That is because AUah (k)
created mankind to worship Him
and to affirm HIS Oneness, as He says: (And I [Allah] created not the
jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me [Alone].)
(Qur'an 51. 56)

(s)

He
also sent the Messengers and revealed the Books so
that He alone might be worshipped. Allah ( B )says: (And verily, We
have sent among every Ummah [community, nation] a Messenger
[proclaiming]: 'Worship Allah [Alone], and avoid [or keep away
from] Trighoot [all false deities, i.e. do not worship Trighoot besides
Allah].') (Qur'an 16: 36)
So exaggeration is contrary to the true concept of
Just as Allah (g)
warned against exaggeration in all forms, the
Prophet (g)
also warned against it so as to protect tawheed, or belief
in the Oneness of Allah, and to block all means that lead to the
undermining of tawheed because exaggeration leads to polytheism,
and it never spreads in a nation without causing its doom. The
Prophet (g)
warned his Ummah against this disease: "0 people,
beware of exaggeration in religious matters, for those who came
before you were doomed because of exaggeration in religious
matters."668 It was narrated from Ibn 'Abbh (&) that he heard
'Umar (&) say on the minbar: "I heard the Prophet (g)
say: 'Do not
praise me as the Christians praised the son of Maryam. I am no more
than a slave, so say "the slave of Allah and His ~ e s s e n g e r " . " ' ~ ~ ~
The Prophet (g)
warned his Ummah against exaggerating and
overstepping the mark in praising him as the Christians did with
regard to 'Eesa (,=)He
. (g)
instructed that he should be described
as a slave as Allah described him: (Glorified be He [Allah] Who took

454

'Ali's ammnrdetowards the Kharijites and Shia

His slave [Muhammad] for a journey by night) (Qur'an 17: 1).Allah
(%) described him in this manner in the context of calling [the jinn]
to Him: (And when the slave of Allah Muhammad] stood up
invoking Him [his Lord - Allah] in prayer they [the jinn] just made
round him a dense crowd as if sticking
- one over the other [in order to
listen to the Prophet's recitation18 (Qur'an 72: 19). He also described
him this way in the context of sending down the Book to him and the
descent of the Angel to him. Allah (&)says: (Blessed be He Who
sent down the criterion [of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur'an] to His
slave Muhammad]) (Qur'an 25: 1). These three scenarios reflect the
highest status, but his Lord (&) described him in each case as His
slave. Where do the R*fidi Shia stand with regard to these verses and
hadiths that forbid and warn against going to extremes and that call
for attaining trne servitude to AUah?
Those who study the words of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali and
his sons (may AUah be pleased with them) will find the clearest
refutation of this extremism and exaggeration and will see that they
have nothing to do with the views of the RZfidi Shia and all those
who exaggerated about them. They will also see that those reports
that are attributed to them are lies and misguidance.670Imam Muslim
narrated in his Saheeh that Abu at-Tufayl 'Amir ibn Wzthilah (&)
said: ''I was with 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib when a man came to him and
said: 'What did the Prophet (g)
tell you in secret? He got angry and
said: 'The Prophet (g)
did not tell me anything in secret that he hid
from the people, but he told me four things.' The man said: 'What are
they, 0 Amir al-Mu'mineen?' 'Ali (4)
said that the Prophet (g)
said: 'May Allah curse the one who curses his father, may Allah
curse the one who offers a sacrifice to anything other than Allah, may
Allah curse the one who gives refuge to an innovator, and may Allah
curse the one who changes the boundary markers."' According to
another report, the man said: "Did the Messenger of AUah (g)
tell
you anything that was for you only?" 'Ali (&) replied: "The

According to a report narrated by Imam Ahmad, 'Ali said:
"The Messenger of Allah
did not tell me anything in exclusion to
other people."672 Bukhari narrated in his Saheeh that Ahu Juhayfah
(&) said: "I said to 'Ali: 'Do you have a document?' He said: 'No,
except the Book of Allah or subtle understanding that a Muslim man
may be given, or what is in this document.' I said: 'What is in this
document?' He said: 'Compensation for death or injury, and ransom
of captives, and that no Muslim should he killed in retaliation for a
n o n - ~ u s l i m . " ' According
~~~
to another report, 'Ali was asked: "Do
you have anything of the revelation apart from the Book of Allah?'
He said: "No, by the One Who split the seed and created the soul, I do
not know of anything except understanding that Allah may bestow
upon some."674

(s)

Ihn Hajar said: "Abu Juhayfah only asked him about that
because some of the Shia were claiming that Ah1 d B a y t - and
especially 'Ali - knew some things that had been revealed that the
Prophet (g)
had told only to them and not to anyone else."675 Ihn
~a~mi~ah(m
Allah
a y have mercy on him) said, after quoting this
hadith: "The documents that are attributed to 'Ali or others of Ah1 alBayt in reports that speak of the future are alllies, such as the document
al-Jifr wal-Bitiqah and others. The same applies to the claim that 'Ali
had knowledge that the Prophet (g)
taught to him only, to the
exclusion of the other Companions, and to the reports narrated from
other Companions saying that the Prophet (g)
singled him out for
teaching esoteric, hidden knowledge of Islam. All of that is false."676
What proves the falseness of these claims is the report narrated
by Ibn Sa'd from 'Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn &'Abideen, who said
about Sa'eed ibn Jubayr (&): "This man used to come to us, and we
would ask him about the shares of inheritance and other things by

456

means of which Allah (g)
would benefit us. We do not have what
these people say we do - and he pointed towards Iraq."677 It was
also narrated that Muhammad ibn al-Hanatiyyah warned the Rififi
Shia about what they were attributing to him of having special
knowledge that the Messenger of Allah (g)
had taught only to Ah1
al-Bayt. He said: "By Allah, we did not inherit anything from the
Messenger of Allah (&) except what is between the two covers
(meaning the ~ u r ' a n ) . " ~ ~ ~
It is narrated in mutawztir reports from Ah1 al-Bayt that they
used to say to their supporters: "0people, love us in accordance with
the teachings of Islam, because the way you love us has gone so far
that it shames
Moreover, in the books of the RiX@ Shia
themselves. there is a warning against going to extremes and a
rejection of that by Ah1 alBayt. Al-Majlisi narrated, with his chain of
narration from 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib (&), that 'Ali said: "Beware of
exaggerating about us; say that we are slaves under the dominion of
our ~ o r d . It" was
~ ~ also
~ narrated from 'Ali (&) that he said: "0
Allah, I renounce those who exaggerate about me just as 'Eesa ibn
Maryam renounced the Christians. 0 Allah, humiliate them forever
and do not support any of them."681
Al-Kulayni narrated, with his chain of narration from Sadeed,
that he said: "Abu Bu~ayr,Yahya al-Bazzir, Diwood ibn Katheer
and I were in the gathering of Abu Abdullah when he came out to us
in a state of anger. When he took his place in the gathering, he said: 'I
am astounded by people who claim that we have knowledge of the
unseen. No one has knowledge of the unseen except Allah (B).I
wanted to hit my slave woman, so-and-so; she ran away, and I did not
know in which room of the house she
Al-Kashshi narrated
that Ahu Busayr said: "I said to Abu Abdullah
'They are
saying ...' He said: 'What are they saying?' I said: 'They are saying
that you know the raindrops, the number of the stars, the leaves on

the trees, the weight of what is in the sea and the number of particles
of soil.' He raised his hand towards the sky and said: 'Glory be to
Allah. No, by Allah, no one knows that except ~ l l a h . " ' ~ ~ ~
These are the words of the pure Imams of Ah1 al-Bayt, as
stated in the books of the RififidiShia themselves; they are innocent of
what the Rifi& Shia claim, because the Rifidis are among the most
untrnthful of Allah's creation. Hypocrisy and telling lies are part of
their religion. Ibn Taymiyah said that they are among the most
mendacious of people with regard to transmitting reports and among
the most ignorant of people with regard to reason.684
Thus the Shia are exposed by their own reports, which
contradict one another. The reports in which the Imams say that they
are the source of provision and rain and so on, which are narrated by
the shaykhs of the Twelvers, are left over from the extreme Shias
whose views the Imams themselves denounced. According to their
reports: "When it was said to Abn Abdullah: 'Al-Mufaddal ibn
'Umar is saying that you determine people's provision,' Abu
Abdullah said: 'By Allah, no one determines our provision except
Allah. I needed food for my family, and I was worried; I thought
about it so much that it dominated my thoughts until I managed to
earn some food for them, then I was able to relax. May Allah curse
and disavow the one who says that."'685
Nonetheless, these reports are like a white hair on a black bull.
Taqiyyah may be used to interpret any report when the Shiite sbaykhs
are not happy with its meaning. For example, listen to what the
commentator on al-Kcifi has to say about the words of Abu Abdullah
quoted above, when he stated that he was astounded by people who
attributed knowledge of the unseen to him, and he refuted that by
saying that his slave woman disappeared and he did not even know
where she was, so how could it be said of him that he had knowledge
of the unseen? The commentator on al-Kifi said: "The aim of

458

X l i S attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

expressing his astonishment openly was so that the ignorant would
not take him as a god, or to prove to some of the people who were
present there and did not recognise his virtue that what was attributed
to him of knowledge of the unseen was not true, so as to protect
himself. However, he had knowledge of what had happened and
what would happen, so how could he not know where his slave
woman was? If yon say that his saying this implies that he was telling
a lie, I say: It is a lie if he did not intend it to be ambiguous, but he did
intend it to he ambiguous, and what he meant was: I do not have any
knowledge that did not come to me from Allah that she was in any
particular room in the
Look at this amazing long-winded effort to refute this report
and to prove that the Imam knows what has happened in the past and
what will happen in the future! In order to prove that, he accuses the
Imam of telling lies, thus demolishing one of their basic principles,
namely infallibility.687
Another of their shaykhs, ash-Sha'rini, who commented on
this explanation by the author of al-KZB, did not like this longwinded way of interpreting the report, so he decided to reject it in the
shortest manner by ruling that this report was a lie. They spread false
rnmonrs like these about the scholars of Ahl al-Bayt, then when
members of Ah1 al-Bayt rejected the fabrications of these liars and
exposed their falsehood before the people, the Shiite scholars
interpreted this rejection and denunciation as being taqiyyah. This
became a trick used by the extreme Shia to keep Shiism within the
circle of extremism, reject the truth and undermine Ah1 a l - ~ a ~ t . ~ ~ '

3.4.9. Their exaggeration in believing that
Allah
has a physical shape

(a)

The misguided belief that Allah (g)
has a physical shape was
well known among the Jews, but the first to introduce it among the
Muslims were the Rifidi Shia. Ar-Rki said: "Most of the Jews liken
Allah to His creation in physical terns. This belief among Muslims
first began with the Rzfidis such as Hishim ibn al-Hakam, Hishim
ibn S2im al-Jaw2leeqi, Yoonus ibn 'Ahd ur-Rallrnh al-Qummi and
Abu Ja'far a l - & w a ~ . " ~ ~ ~
All of these men are regarded by the Twelvers as being
pioneers among their shaykhs and trustworthy in transmitting their
madh-hah.69*Ibn Taymiyah identified the first one who fabricated
this idea, saying: "The first one in Islam who is known to have said
that Allah has a physical shape was Hishim ibn al-~&am."~~'Those
who study different sect? narrated from him and his followers
extreme statements, which would make the believers' skin crawl if
they were to hear them. 'Abdul-Q%r d-Baghd2di said: "Hishim ibn
al-Hakam claimed that his god was a physical being with limits to his
physical being, that he was tall and wide and deep, and that he was as
tall as he was wide."693 There are very many reports narrated from
H i s h h ihn al-Hakam and his followers about extreme views on the
belief that Allah has a physical shape; these are narrated in the books
on sects and elsewhere.694
Likening Allah, the Exalted, the Almighty, to His creation is a
belief that existed a111ong the Jews and leaked into Shiism. The first
one to propagate this idea was Hishim ibn d-Hakam, and he
influenced others who are known in the books on sects as misguided,
extreme madh-habs belonging to the ~ w e l v e r sThe
. ~ ~shaykhs
~
of the
Twelvers defended these people despite abundant reports of their
misguided notions. Their evil became widespread, and they went to
extremes to find an acceptable way to interpret every notorious

statement attributed to them, or they said it was a fabrication.696
It is mentioned in a number of their reports that Hisham ibn d Hakam and H i s h h ibn S h d-Jawaeeqi played a role in spreading
the idea among the Shia that Allah bas a physical shape,697but the
Imams rejected them and their statements. When one of the Shia
came to their Imam and told him that be followed the view of
H i s b h , their Imam Abu d-Hasan 'Ali ibn Muhammad said: "What
do you have to do with the view of H i s h h ? The one who claims that
Allah has a physical shape is not one of us, and we have nothing to do
with him in this world and in the hereafter."698
Some of their reports mention what they say about Allah (&$j.
In one, someone699 told Abn Abdullah what one group of Shia
believed about Allah having a physical shape. "He said: 'Some of our
companions claim that Allah bas an image like that of man.' Another
one said that He 'has the image of a beardless man with very curly
hair.' Abu Abdullah fell down in prostration, then he raised his head
and said: 'Glory be to the One like Whom there is nothing. No vision
can grasp Him, and no knowledge can encompass ~ i m . " ' ~ "
Tbeir senior scholars went to extremes in understanding the
attributes of Allah (g)
literally, to the extent that they likened Him to
His creation. This constitutes disbelief in Allah ( g j because it is a
rejection of the verse in which He (&) says, #There is nothing like
HimB (Qur'an 42: 11).They rejected the attributes that are befitting to
Him and ascribed to Him attributes other than those He ascribed to
Himself. They have many reports of this nature.70'
This trend towards extremism in understanding the divine
attributes literally (by interpreting them as being like the attributes of
man) is different from affirming the attributes of Allah (&j and
understanding them in an appropriate way, which is the way of the
scholars of Ah1 al-Bayt. The Shiite madb-hab split into two

'Ali ibn Abi TZlib

461

competing groups: a group led by H i s h h , which believed that Allah
has a physical shape, and a group that believed that Allah is above
being similar to His creation. The latter is the view of Ah1 al-Bayt, as
indicated by the reports of the Shia themselves, as is proven and
widely documented in the books of the scholars.702

3.4.10. Their denial of the divine attributes
After this going to extremes in interpreting the divine
attributes in a literal sense (likening Allah to His creation), the madhhab began to change at the end of the third century AH, when it was
influenced by Mutazilite ideas denying some attributes of the Creator
(&) that are affirmed in the Qur'an and Sunnah.
The trend towards this denial became stronger in the fourth
century AH, when al-Mufeed and his followers like al-Moosawi
(who is known as ash-Shareef ar-Raay and Abu Ja'far at-Toosi)
began to write books based on the books of the ~ u t a z i l i t e s . ~
Much
~'
of what they wrote was copied line by line from the commentary of
the Mutazilites, such as what they said when interpreting verses of
the Qur'an that speak of the divine attributes, the divine will and
decree and so on.704 The one who reads the hooks of the later Shia
can hardly see any difference between these books and the books of
the Mutazilites on the topic of the divine names and attributes
because they claim that reason is their foundation with regard to what
they believe concerning these issues. The beliefs of the Mutazilites in
this regard were adopted by the later Shiite shaykhs, including the
issue of the Qur'an being created, the idea that the believers will not
see their Lord in the hereafter, and denial of the divine attributes.
Moreover, the specious arguments that the Mutazilites developed are
the same as those offered by the later Shiite shaykhs.
What is different in the Shia books is that the reports denying
the divine attributes are attributed to the Imams. They came up with

462

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

numerous reports about the Imams to support rnis view. They
fabricated false reports, which they attributed tc Amir al-Mu'mineen
'ALi (&) and some of the scholars of Ah1 al-Bayt such as
Muhammad al-BQir and Ja'far as-Sgdiq, claiming that they denied
the divine attributes. Some of their contemporary shaykhs regard this
as their basis for denying the divine attributes; one of them wrote
under the title Tareeqat Ma'rifat aj-Sif2t (How to know the divine
attributes): "Is there any room for further discussion of the divine
attributes? Is there any way other than to submit to the word of Amir
al-Mn'mineen: 'The highest level of sincerity is to deny that He has
any attributes'?"'"
In fact, what is proven from Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
and the Imams of Ah1 al-Bayt is that they affirmed the divine
attributes, and the reports concerning that are numerous and well
proven in the books of the scholars.706This is also admitted in some
reports that exist among the huge accumulation of reports that speak
of denying the divine attributes. A number of their own reports
describe the Lord of the Worlds in negative terms, denying that these
are attributes of Allah (k).
This is notbing new, because this is the
way of those who are misguided and have drifted away from the path
of the Messengers, such as the philosophers, the Mutazilites and
others.
Allah (%) sent His Messengers to affirm His attributes in
detail and to deny certain things in general terns. The divine

are denied in general t e r m ~ . ~ ~ ~(&)

Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the !&Seer) (Qur'an 42: 11). The
denial comes in general terms: "There is nothing like Him." This is
the usual way of the Qur'an in denying. Allah says: dDo you know of
any who is similar to Him?) (Qur'an 19: 65)This means: do you know
of any who is like Him, who deserves a name like His? It was also

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

463

said that it means: Do you know any competitor who could compete
with ~ i m ? ~This

'Abbss: "Do you know of any who is like or similar to Him?"709
AUah (%) also says: 4And there is none co-equal or comparable unto
Him.) (Qur'an 112: 4 ) With regard to the affirmation of the divine
attributes, this appears in detail: dand He is the AL-Hearer, the Allseer.) (Qur'an 42: 11)
At the end of Soorat al-Hashr, Allah (g)
says: dHe is Allah,
beside Whom Lci ilhha ill6 Huwa [none has the right to be
worshipped but He] the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He is Allah, beside Whom Lri
ilciha ill6 Huwa [none has the right to be worshipped hut He], the
King, the Holy, the One Free from all defects, the Giver of security,
the Watcher over His creatures, the All-Mighty, the Compeller, the
Supreme. Glory be to Allah! [High is He] above all that they
associate as partners with Him. He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor
of all things, the Bestower of forms. To Him belong the Best Names.
All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him. And He is the
All-Mighty, the All-Wise.) (Qur'an 59: 22-24)
There are many other similar verses as well.710
The Shia narrate from their Imams that the Creator cannot be
described except in the way He described Him~elf.~"However, the
Shia turned away from that just as they turned away from the Book of
Allah and from the dictates of reason and common sense, preferring
instead the route of mere imitation and picking up the garbage of
extinct philosophies. How can any rational person dare to rely with regard to a matter of the unseen, which there is no way to know
in detail except by means of divine texts - on limited rational
discussions and flawed ideas, and to refer concerning these issues to
the contradictory imagination of human beings and their conflicting
concepts?712

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

3.4.10.a. The issue of the Qur'an being created
The Qur'an is the word of Allah that was revealed, not created.
This is what is indicated by the Qur'an, the Sunnah and the consensus
of the early generation,713but the Twelvers followed in the footsteps
of the Mutazilites with regard to the idea that the Qur'an is created.
Al-Majlisi the Shaykh of the Shia, wrote a chapter in Bihrir al-Anwrir
entitled: "The Qur'an is created."714 In this chapter, he narrated
eleven reports; most of them are contrary to what he said, but the
shaykhs have their own way of interpreting them, which we will
discuss shortly. The Shiite scholar M+sin aJ-Ameen said: "The Shia
and the Mutazilites said: 'The Qur'an is created."'715 This is based
on their denial of the divine amibute of speech and their claim that
Allah (&) created speech in some of His creation, such as the hush
when He spoke to Moosa, and Jibreel when He sent down the
~ u r ' a n . We
~ ' ~have quoted above some of what their shaykhs said
about this
If you refer to the reports that they narrated from Ah1 al-Bayt,
you will find that most of them differ from the view of the Shia on
this issue. For example, in Tafseer al- 'Ayyrishi, it is narrated from arRida that he was asked about the Qur'an, and he said: "It is the word
of Allah and is not ~reated."~"In at-Tawheed by Ihn Biibawayh alQummi, it is recorded that it was said to Abu aJ-Hasan Moosa (4):
"0 son of the Messenger of Allah, what do you say about Qur'an?
Those who came before differed concerning it; some people say that
it is created, and some say that it is not created." He (&) said: "As
for me, I do not say what they say; instead I say that it is the word of
Allah ( B ) . " ~ ' ~
They have many ~ i m i l a r r e ~ o r hut
t s , it~ may
~ ~ be noted that the
ShayWn of the Shia during his lifetime, Ihn Bzbawayh al-Qummi,
went in the opposite direction in interpreting these texts. He affirmed
that the view of the Imams was: "Saying that the Qur'an is not

I

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

465

created means that it is not a lie (or not made-up), but it does not
mean that it is not created (or not brought into being)."721 He also
said: "The reason why we refrain from using the word 'created'
(maWllooq) is that it could mean false, as in the phrase kaliim
maWllooq makdhoob (false, made-up
However, the scholars of the pious predecessors, the earliest
generations of the righteous followers of Islam, refuted them, saying:
"When we say that it is not created, we do not mean thereby that it is
not fabricated; suggesting that it is fabricated is blatant disbelief, as
any Muslim knows. In fact, the issue here is that they said that it is
created in a true sense, and the pious predecessors refuted this view.
This is mentioned in many reports narrated from them, and they
wrote many hooks about that."723

In Tafseer as-Sir$ al-Mustaqeem, by the Shiite scholar alBuroojoordi, a text is quoted from Ibn Bibawayh in which he
interpreted the reports stating that the Qur'an is not created as being
taqiyyah. He said: "The reason for the Imam not describing the
Qur'an as created is either because of taqiyyah and going along with
the people, or it is because saying it is created may be thought to
indicate another meaning which was used by the disbelievers when
they said: @Thisis nothing but an invention!%(Qur'an 38: 7)"724
These shaykhs could not find any other explanation to turn to except
suggesting that it was taqiyyah and the like.
This method proves that they have no foundation for anything
they say. The possibility of taqiyyah in every text has led to great
confusion and caused the essence of their madh-hab to he lost, so
their religion has become a religion based on the views of al-Majlisi,
al-Kulayni or Ibn Bibawayh al-Qummi, not on the reports of the
Imams.725Thus knowledge and tmth were lost because of this crafty
method, and the Ummah will remain in a state of division and dispute
because of these methods, which are inspired by Satan with his plots.

466

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shia

If any of their shaykhs wants to do a favour to the Shia and
guide them, he should lead them to the way of the main body of
Muslims. He should take from their reports what is in accordance
with the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger (@J, and the
way of the noble Companions and scholars of Ahl as-Sunnah walJamii'ah, and he should get rid of the devious ideas of al-Qummi, dKulayni and al-Majlisi. The Imams themselves complained about
many people fabricating lies about them, to the extent that they said:
"The people are fond of telling lies about
If you want to apply this method of finding the reports of Ah1
as-Sunnah that are in harmony with reports of the Shia from Ah1 dBayt concerning this issue, you will fmd that the books of the Shia
include (as we have seen above) reports from Ah1 al-Bayt stating that
the Word of Allah was revealed, not created, and the books of Ah1 asSnnnah say the same thing. It was narrated by Bukhari in Kitrib Af'cil
al-'~brid:~
Ibn
~ Abi ~2timy'' Ahu Sa'eed ad-Dzmi, al-Ljurri in

when he was asked about the Qur'an: "It is neither a creator nor
created." Ibn Taymiyah said: "There are abundant reports to that
effect from ~a'far."~~~

So why not adopt the reports that are common to both Sunnis
and Shia, forsaking the falsehood that has nothing to support it except
the views of shaykhs who want to cause division and disputes in the
Ummah? These shaykhs strive to be odd and to isolate their groups so
that they will have the opportunity to accumulate huge amounts of
money in the name of the one-fifth, to attain social status, and to be
regarded as 'holy men' on the basis of being the deputies of the
hidden Imam. For these reasons, they persisted in confirming the
view that "Whatever is different from the masses is a sign of
guidance":35 referring thereby to Ah1 as-Sunnah walJam2'ah.

The belief of Ah1 as-Sunnah wal-Jamg'ah with regard to this

from Him, without discussing how, in the form of words. It came
down to His Messenger as revelation, and the believers believed in it
and were certain that it was the word of Allah (&)in a true sense, not
something created like the words of people. Whoever hears it and
claims that it is the word of a human being has committed an act of
disbelief and is condemned by Allah and promised hell. Allah (&)
says: 41 will cast him into hellfire# (Qur'an 74: 26). Allah has promised
hell to those who say: @Thisis nothing but the word of a human
being!) (Qur'an 74: 25) Therefore we know for certain that it is the
word of the Creator of mankind and is not like human speech.740

3.4.10.b. The issue of seeing Allah (g)
The Imami Shia, because of their agreement with the
Mutazilikes, say that Allah (%) will not be seen. They narrated
numerous reports, which were mentioned by Ibn Bgbawayh in his
book At-Tawheed and most of which were also compiled by the
author of Bihrir al-Anwrir, denying what is mentioned in the texts
about the believers seeing their Lord in the hereafter.

'Ali's attitude towards the Khurijites and Shia

For example, they fabricated a report saying that Abu
Ahdullah Ja'far as-S2diq was asked about Allah (s):
''Will He be
seen in the hereafter?" and he replied: "Glorified and exalted be He
far above that; vision can only grasp that which has colour and shape,
and Allah is the Creator of colours and shapes."741Their shaykh and
'Ayatollah' Ja'far an-Najafi, the author of Kashf al-Ghaca', said: "If
someone ascribes some attributes to Allah, such as saying that He
could he seen, he is to be regarded as an apostate."742Al-Hnrr d ' k i l i regarded denying that the believers will see Allah as one of
the fundamentals of the Imams; he wrote a chapter entitled "No eye
can see Allah, and no vision can encompass Him in this world or in
the hereafter."743
Their denial that the believers will see their Lord in the
hereafter is contrary to what is stated in the Sharia text and is also
contrary to the madh-hah of Ah1 d-Bayt, as some of their reports
admit. Ibn B2bawayh al-Qummi narrated from Abu Busayr that he
said to Abu Ahdullah: "Tell me about Allah, may He be glorified and
exalted: will the believers see Him on the Day of Resurrection?" He
said: "Yes, seeing [Allah] is the right of the people of paradise, who
will see Him without encompassing Him and without knowing how,
as it says in the Book of our Lord, such as the verses in which Allah
(&) says: &Some faces that Day shall be Nidirah [shining and
radiant]. Looking at their Lord [Allahlb (Qur'an 75: 22-23) and
(There they will have all that they desire - and We have more [for
them, i.e. a glance at the All-Mighty, All-Majestic]) (Qur'an 50: 35).
Anas ibn M%ik (&)
. . said: 'This means looking upon the
countenance of Allah
Allah (%) also says: (For those who have done good is the
best reward and even more [i.e. having the honour of glancing at the
countenance of mah]b (Qur'an 10: 26). The 'best reward' is paradise,
and 'even more' is gazing upon His noble countenance. It was

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

469

explained in this way by the Messenger of Allah (g)
and the
Companions after him. Muslim narrated in his Saheeh that Suhayb
said that the Messenger of Allah
recited the verse, $For those
who have done good is the best reward and even more [i.e. having the
honour of glancing at the countenance of Allah]), (Qur'an 10: 26),
then he said: "When the people of paradise have entered paradise,
Allah (&) will say: 'Do you want anything more?' They will say:
'Have You not brightened our faces and admitted us to paradise and
saved us from the fire?' Then He will remove the veil, and they will
not be given anything that is dearer to them than gazing upon their
Lord (3g)."745

(a)

And AUah (&) says: $Nay! Surely, they [evil doers] will be
veiled from seeing their Lord that ~ a y . ) (Qur'an
,
83: 15)
Ash-Shifa'i and other scholars use this verse as evidence that
the people of paradise will see their Lord. At-Tabari and others
narrated from 2-Muzani from ashShifafa'i, and 2-H&m said: AlA ~ a m mtold us that ar-Rabee' ibn Sulaym2.n said: "I was with
Muhammad ibn Idrees ash-Shifa'i, who had received a letter from
Upper Egypt that said: 'What do you think about the verse in which
Allah
says: $Nay! Surely, they [evil doers] will be veiled from
seeing their Lord that Day?), (Qur'an 83: 15)' Ash-Shifa'i (may AUah
have mercy on him) said: 'Since they will be screened away because
of [Allah's] wrath, that indicates that His close friends will see Him
because He is pleased with them."'746

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

3.4.11. Their giving the Imams precedence
over the prophets and Messengers
The Messengers are the best of mankind and the most
deserving of being bearers of the message. Allah prepared them to
reach the highest level of servitude, conveying the message, calling
people and striving in jihad. dAllah knows best with whom to place
His Message&(Qur'an 6: 124). They are distinguished by the fact that
they, out of all mankind, attained the position of ~ e s s e n g e r and
,~~~
AUah enjoined mankind to follow them: BWe sent no Messenger, but
to be obeyed by Allah's leave,& (Qur'an 4: 64). No one among
mankind is to be given precedence over them.
At-Tahhiwi said, explaining the beliefs of Ah1 as-Sunnah:
"We do not give precedence to any one of the close friends of Allah
over any one of the Prophets (EL),). We say: One Prophet is better
than all the close friends of ~ l l a h . " ' ~Giving
~
precedence to the
Imams over the Prophets is the way of the extreme Rifi&s, as was
pointed out by 'Abdul-Q& a l - ~ a ~ h d a d ial-Qidi
,~~'
and
Ibn ~ a ~ m i ~ This
a h . particular
~ ~ ~ view became one of the
fundamentals of the Twelvers. The author of al-Was6'il stated that
giving precedence to the Imams over the Prophets is one of the
fundamentals of the Shiite madh-hab, which they attribute to the
Imams. He also said that the reports that they have concerning this
are innumerable.754
In B i G r al-Anwrir, alMajlisi wrote a chapter entitled "Giving
them
precedence over the Prophets and all of mankind" in
which it says that Allah took a covenant from the Prophets and from
the angels and all of creation, and that the Messengers of strong will
only attained that status because of their love for the Imams.755This
view on which the Twelver madh-hab finally settled went through
changes and alterations that took it in the direction of extremism.
With regard to the issue of giving the Prophets precedence over the

(m)

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

4 71

Imams, the Shia were divided into three groups, as al-Ash'ari said:
(i) The first group believed that the Prophets are better than
the Imams, and some of them said that it is possible for the
Imams to be better than the angels,
(ii) The second group claimed that the Imams are better than
the Prophets and the angels
(iii)The third group adopted the Mutazilite madb-hab but
believed in imamate; they said that the angels and Prophets
are better than the ~ m a m s . ~ ' ~

In Awri'il al-Maqaq8lrit, al-Mufeed added a fourth group who
believe in the superiority of the Imams over all of the Prophets except
for the five Messengers of strong
He does not state which of
these views he regards as most correct; be simply says the matter
needs further examinati~n.~'~
It seems that all of these groups were
weakened as a result of the efforts of the shaykhs of the Safavid state
and those who followed them, and the madh-hab settled on extreme
views with regard to the Imams, to the extent that al-Majlisi said in
the chapter in Bih6r al-Anwrir that he wrote for this purpose: "The
Messengers of strong will only became Messengers of strong will
because of their love for the Imams, blessings of Allah be upon
/
them."759
However, the one who refers to the Book of Allah ( B )will
find that there is no mention of their twelve Imams, let alone any
suggestion that they are given precedence over the Prophets and
Messengers of AUah. He will also notice that the Prophets, because
of their higher status, are given precedence over others of the
righteous slaves of Allah who are mentioned. AUah
says: (They
will be in the company of those on whom AUah has bestowed His
Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddeeqoon [those followers of the
Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu

(s)

472

'Ali's attitude towards the Khawites and Shia

Bakr as-Siddeeq], the martyrs, and the righteous# (Qur'an 4: 69).
AUah (s)
listed His blessed slaves in four categories.760 The Book
of Allah, in all its verses, indicates that the Prophets are chosen above
all others.761 The people of the best three generations were
unanimously agreed on the superiority of the Prophets over all others,
and their consensus is binding proof. Ibn Taymiyah said: "The early
generations (pious predecessors) of the Ummah, its leading scholars
and the close friends of Allah ( B )were unanimously agreed that the
Prophets are superior to the close friends of Allah (&) who are not
Reason also clearly indicates that a Prophet is in a position
whereby he must be obeyed; his commands, prohibitions and rulings
must be heeded, with no restrictions. The fact that the Imam is a
deputy and a follower cannot make sense unless he is of lower status
than the Prophet. This is applicable to every Prophet and is not
applicable to any of the Imams, so there is no Imam at all who is
better than a Prophet; that is impossible.763
Moreover, there is repofled in the books of the Shia
themselves a report which is in accordance with the texts, scholarly
consensus and common sense, and which contradicts this odd view.
This report, narrated by al-Kulayni from H i s h h al-Ahwal from
Zayd ibu 'Ali, says that the Prophets are superior to the Imams and
that anyone who says otherwise is misguided.764 Ibn Biibawayh
narrated from as-Siidiq that the Prophets are more beloved to Allah
(&) than is 'Ali (&). 765

3.5. The attitude of the Imami Shia
towards the Noble Qufan
The Imami Shiite belief and the attempt to defend it had a great
impact in motivating some of the Shia to adopt dangerous ideas about

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

473

the Qur'an, Sunnah and Companions (may Allah be pleased with
them). They doubted the Qur'an, rejected many of the proven
hadiths, and impugned and condemned the Companions, claiming
that they deliberately lied and distorted the Book of Allah.

3.5.1. The belief among some of them
that the Book of Allah was distorted,
and refutation of their claim
Some of the R2fidi Shia claimed'that the noble Qur'an was
distorted and that the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them)
omitted some soorahs and many verses that were revealed. These
were supposedly about the virtues of Ahl al-Bayt; they say that they
enjoined following them, forbade going against them, enjoined love
of them, listed the names of their enemies and impugned and cursed
those enemies. The Shia accuse the Companions of omitting from the
Qur'an, among other things, the phrase "and We have made 'Ali your
son-in-law" from Soorat ash-Sharh; this would suggest that 'Ali is
the only son-in-law of the Messenger (g),
to the exclusion of
'Uthrniin. They were ignorant of the fact that this soorah was revealed
in Ma!&&, so 'Ali was not the son-in-law of the Messenger (s)
at
the time it was revealed; the fact is that Ali married Fitimah in
Madinah, after the battle of Badr, as we have seen above. The Shia
also think that among the material omitted from the Qur'an is what
they call 'the chapter of imamate', which they claim is a lengthy
soorah in which the virtues of Ahl al-Bayt are
Thus most of the claims of this group of Shia about the Qur'an
are based on these ideas. They do not deny any of its rulings or
principles, but their view focuses on the alleged omission of some
verses that speak of the imamate of 'Ali and the Imams after him.
These fabrications against the noble Qur'an were repeated by a
number of Imami Shiite scholars, foremost among whom was their

474

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

famous 'Hujjah' Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn Ya'qoob al-Kulayni (d.
329 AH). He was the author of al-K6fi, which is regarded by the Shia
as being as authentic to the same degree that the book of Bukhari is
regarded by Ahl as-Sunnah as authentic. The Shiite author of Tafseer
as-Sifi says: "It seems that 'the trustworthy of Islam' Muhammad ibn
Ya'qoob al-Kulayni (may All& have mercy on him) also believed
that the Qur'an had been distorted and some things omitted from it,
because he narrated several reports to that effect in his book al-K63,
and he did not comment by suggesting that they were flawed or
criticising them; on the contraq, he said at the beginning of his book
that he tmsted everything he narrated in it."767
This book of al-Kulayni's is full of these deviant claims, which
are basically aimed at affirming the imamate of 'Ali ibn Abi T%b
(&) and the Imams who came after him. For example, al-Kulayni
narrated from Abu Busayr from Abu Abdullah concerning the verse
(And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger) (Qur'an 33: 71)
that with regard to the imamate of 'Ali and the Imams after him, (he
has indeed achieved a great achievement) (Qur'an 33: 71). He
claimed that the phrase 'with regard to the imamate of 'Ali and the
Imams after him' was part of the original revelation.768
He also narrated from J2bir that Abu Ja'far (!@) said: "Why is
'Ali ibn Abi Taib called Amir al-Mu'mineen?" He said: "Allah
called him that, and this is how it was revealed in His Book: 'And
(remember) when your Lord brought forth from the children of
Adam, from their loins, their seed (or from Adam's loin his offspring)
and made them testify as to themselves (saying): Am I not your Lord,
and is not Muhammad My Messenger, and is not 'Ali Amir alMu'mineen?"'769
Al-Kulayni also narrated that m a d ibn Muhammad ibn Abi
Nasr said: "Abu al-Hasan was given a mushaf, and he said: 'Do not
look in it.' So I opened it and read, (Those who disbelieve from

I

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

475

among the people of the Scripture [Jews and Christians] and AlMushrikoon were not going to leave [their disbelief] until there came
to them clear evidence) (Qur'an 98: I), and I found written in the
soorah seventy men of Quraysh, mentioned by their names and the
names of their fathers. He sent the mu~hafto me.'2770
Al-Kulayni claimed that no one compiled the Qur'an in
totality except the Imams, who know it in its entirety; no one
preserved it or memorised it as it was revealed except 'Ali ibn Abi
Tilib (&) and the Imams after him. This lie, which connected the
compilation of the Qur'an to 'Ali (&>), was repeated elsewhere. The
author of al-Ihtijcij suggested that when the Messenger (g)
died:
'Ali (,@) collected the Qur'an and brought it to the Muhijireen and
Ansir and showed it to them, because the Prophet (g)
had instructed
him to do that. When Abu Bakr opened it, on the first page he opened
there appeared the evil deeds of the people. 'Umar jumped up and
said: '0 'Ali, take it away, we have no need of it.' So 'Ali took it and
went away. Then they brought Zayd ibn Thibit, who knew the
Qur'an well, and 'Umar said to him: "Ali brought the Qur'an, and in
it were the evil deeds of the Muhzjireen and An$&. We thought that
we should compile the Qur'an and omit from it what it contained of
evil deeds and exposure of the Muhijireen and An$&.' Zayd agreed
to that, then he said: 'If I complete my task of compiling the Qur'an
as you asked, and 'Ali tells the people about the Qur'an that he has
compiled, won't all your efforts be in vain?' 'Umar said: 'What
should we do then?' Zayd said: 'You know best what to do.' 'Umar
said: 'Tbere is no option but to kill him and get rid of him.' They tried
to kill him at the hand of Khgid ibn d-Wdeed, but were not able to
do that."771
"

Undoubtedly, reports like this are the fabrication of sick and
corrupt minds that want to accuse the Companions of distorting the
Qur'an and conspiring to deprive 'Ali of the position of Imam of the

476

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Muslims. When the fabricator of this report tries to praise him, he
actually undermines him, because he describes him as keeping quiet
when the Companions refused to accept his Qur'an. How can this he
in accordance with the heroic attitude of 'Ali (&) in defending
Islam? The words of 'Ali (&) himself refute all this nonsense: "The
greatest in reward with regard to the mu~hafis Ahu Bakr (&). May
Allah have mercy on Abu B k ; he was the first one to compile what
is between the two covers (meaning the ~ u r ' a n ) . " ~ ~ '
Al-Kulayni did not stop there, though. He went on to attribute
these fabrications and false claims about the distortion of the Qur'an
to Ja'far as-Szdiq, claiming that he said: "The Qur'an that was
brought down by revelation to Muhammad was seven thousand
verses, and the verses that we recite are only 6,263; the rest are kept
with Ahl a l - ~ a ~ t .Al-Kulayni
"~~~
claims that as-Siidiq said,
concerning the Qur'an that was collected by 'Ali ihn Abi TSih, "It
was said to be three times greater than this Qur'an of yours, and by
Allah, there is not even one letter of your Qur'an in it."774
They also say that "Fiitimah (F&)lived for seventy-five days
after the Prophet
died, sufferinggrief such as only Allah ( B )
knows. Allah
sent Jibreel to her to console her and comfort her,
and to tell her about her father and what would happen to her
children. 'Ali (&) listened to what he said until he wrote down a
mushafthree times the size of the Qur'an, in which there was nothing
about haliil and h a r k , but it did contain knowledge of what is to
happen."775

(s)
(s)

Another Shiite scholar, 'Ali ibn b r a e e m , reiterated the same
claims that were mentioned by al-Kulayni. Muhammad Muhsiu, who
is known as al-Fayd al-Kashshi, narrated from him in his
commentary on the Qur'an and said: "What we may learn from the
reports narrated via Ah1 al-Bayt is that the Qur'an that is extant
among us is not complete as it was revealed to Muhammad. Some of

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

477

it is different from what Allah ( B )revealed, some of it has been
distorted and changed, and many things have been omitted from it,
such as the name of 'Ali in many places, the phrase 'the family of
Muhammad' more than once, the names of the hypocrites in several
places, and other things. It is not in the order that is pleasiug to Allah
and His Messenger." The same view was also held by 'Ali ibn
Ibriheem, who is known as al-Qummi, who wrote a commentary that
is filled with these claims and exaggerations, and he started to wtite
nonsense and claimed that there are verses concerning the
appointment of 'Ali to the imamate that have been erased.776
The author of Baf&'irad-Darajit, as-Safir, said, claiming that
his chain of narration went back to Abu Ja'far: "No one can claim to
have collected the entire Qur'an, physicaUy and with the proper
understanding, except for the 11nams."~~~
It was also narrated that he
said: "Anyone who says that he compiled the entire Qur'an as Allah
(&) revealed it is a liar. No one compiled it or memorised it as it was
revealed except 'Ali ibn Abi TZlib and the Imams after him."778 In
Tafseer al- 'AyBshi it is narrated from Abu Abdullah: "If the Qur'an
were recited as it was revealed, you would find us named in it."779 In
the same hook, it is also narrated from Abu Ja'far: "Were it not for the
fact that things have been added to and taken away from the Book of
Allah, our rights would not be hidden from anyone who has any
sense."780
There are many reports in the books of the RZfidi Sbia which
clearly state that the Qur'an is distorted, and their senior scholars
spoke of the great number of such reports, reaching the level of being
mutawZhr. Al-Mufeed said: "There are abundant reports from the
Imams of guidance, who are of the family of Muhammad (B),that
speak of the distortion of the Qur'an and what some of the
wrongdoers did in terms of omitting and taking away."781

478

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Hishim a l - ~ ~ one

interpreters of
Qur'an, says: "It should be noted that the fact which no one can
ignore, on the basis of the mutawikir reports we have and others, is
that this Qur'an that we have was subjected to a great many changes
after the Messenger of Allah (g)
died. Those who compiled it after
he was gone omitted many words and verses."783He also says: "This
issue (the distortion of the Qur'an) is so clear to me, after examining
the reports, that we could rule that this view is one of the
fundamentals of Shiism and one of the greatest supports for the belief
in imamate."784
Ni'matnllah a l - ~ a z i ? i r isaid:
~ ~ ~'The reports that point to this
(distortion of the Qur'an) are more than two thousand hadith, and
several scholars claimed that they (these reports) are abundant in
number, such as al-Mufeed, al-Muhaqqiq a d - D h i d and al-'AUhah
al-~ajlisi."~~~
It is the view of their senior scholars that the reports in their
books which claim that the Qur'an has been distorted and altered are
abundant, to the level of being mutawitir, and that the number of
these reports reaches into the thousands. For this reason, some of the
scholars stated with certainty that this belief is one of the
fundamentals of their madh-hab and the greatest support for the
belief in imamate. In addition to the thousands of reports in their
books which claimed that the Qur'an has been distorted, this corrnpt
belief is confirmed in the views of their scholars, their ideologues and
those individuals who are considered qualified to exercise ijtihid. We
do not have enough room here to quote all of them, but I shall refer to
those who stated that there was consensus on this matter among their
senior scholm.

Al-Mufeed says: "They (the Imami Shia) are agreed that the
leaders of misguidance tampered with a great deal of the Qur'an, and
they changed it from the way it was revealed and the Sunnah of the

'Ali ihn Ahi Trilib

479

Prophet (&). The Mutazilites, Kharijites, Murja'is and Sunnis all
agreed on a view different from that of the Imami Shia in all that we
have mentioned."787
An-Noon at-Tubrusi (d. 1320 AH), one of their senior scholars
in later times, wrote a huge volume called Fasl al-Khitcib fi Zthbcit
Tahreef Kitcib Rabb al-Arbcib (The Ultimate Proof of the Distortion
of the Book of the Lord of Lords) to prove the R2fidi Shiite claims
about the ~ u r ' a n . ~ "He began with three introductions, followed by
two chapters entitled: "On the evidence for the distortion of the
Qur'an" and "Refutation of those among the Ummah who say that
the Qur'an is sound."
In his book, at-Tnbrusi quoted thousands of reports to show
that the Qur'an has been distorted as they claim. The first chapter is
composed of twelve sections; in the last two sections alone, he quotes
1602 reports. This is in addition to what he quoted in the other
sections of this chapter, in the three introductions and in the second
chapter. Apologising for the small number of reports that he had
collected, he said: "We are quoting reports to support the idea even
though we do not know about all the reports."7x9 To prove the
authenticity of these reports, he wrote: "It should be noted that these
reports are transmitted from the reliable books that our scholars refer
to in order to decide about Sharia rulings and the Prophet's
~ u n n a h . " ~After
~ ' including a long list of names of their scholars
who believe that the Qur'an has been distorted, a list that took up to
five pages of his book, he said: "On the basis of the names that I have
listed, even though I cannot claim that I included everyone, we can
claim that this view is the prominent view among the earlier scholars,
and those who differed with them are limited to a few individuals
whom we shall mention be~ow."'~'Then he said that those who held
a different view were: as-Sadooq, al-Murta&i and Shaykb at-Tiifah
at-Toosi. He said: "No one among the earlier scholars is known to
have agreed with them."792

480

'Ali's attitude towards the Khurijites and Shia

!

He said that at-Tubmsi, the author of Mujma' al-Bayin,
followed the view of these earlier scholars and that up until his time,
no different view was known except from these four ~ h a ~ k h s . ~ ~ ~
Then he tried to find an excuse to explain why these scholars did not
affm that the Qur'an has been distorted; he claimed that it was a
matter of taqiyyah and 'appeasing the other group' (meaning the
Sunnis). He said, excusing at-Toosi for what he narrated in his book
at-Tibycin about the Qur'an not having been distorted: "It is no secret
to the one who examines the book at-Tibycin that the author's
approach is clearly trying his utmost to appease the other group (the
Sunnis). This would be very strange were it not the case that he is
trying to appease them."794
An-Noon at-Tubrnsi was preceded in hying to find excuses
for the scholars by Ni'matullah al-Jazsiri who said, after narrating
that there was consensus among the Imami scholars that the Qur'an
had been distorted: "Yes, al-Muma, a.-Sadooq and Shaykh atTubrnsi held a different view and stated that what is between the two
covers of this mushaf is the Qur'an and nothing else, and that no
distortion or alteration has affected it. It seems that they said this for a
number of reasons such as: to leave no excuse for anyone to
undermine the Qur'an by saying that if it is possible for that to
happen to the Qur'an, then how is it permissible to follow its
teachings and mlings when it is possible that it has been distorted?
How could these prominent scholars narrate in their books many
reports saying that these things happened to the Qur'an and that suchand-such a verse was revealed and then changed?"795
Thus it seems that the belief that the Qur'an has been distorted,
altered and changed is one on which all RZfidi Shiite scholars agree.
That is what at-Tubrnsi established in Fa$ al-Khitrib, and it is
indicated by the previous statements of their senior scholars. None of
their scholars disagreed about this belief until the time when Fasl al-

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

481

Khi@b was written, apart from four of them, and the reason for that is
given as taqiyyah and seeking to appease the Sunnis, according to
what was stated by at-Tubrnsi and al-JazViti before him. This has
been proven by contemporary research that examined this issue and
supported this view by quoting from the Shiite reports a great deal of
evidence that illustrates their belief that the Qur'an was distorted and
that is mentioned in the books of these four ~ h a ~ k hThis
s.~
proves
~~
that these four also believed in this idea and agreed with what all
other R Z d i Shiite scholars believe about the Qur'an having been
distorted, even though they stated otherwise for the purpose of
taqiyyah, hypocrisy and deceiving Ah1 a s - ~ u n n a h . ~ ~ ~
The proof for what I am saying is the fact that none of those
who claimed that the Qur'an was distorted were subject to any
criticism from the Shia. For example, al-Kulayni is still respected,
trusted and honoured, and he is the primary religious authority for all
Shia today. Even though the contemporary Shia say that they deny
the idea of the Qur'an having been distorted or of anything having
been added or subtracted, we do not find any of them refuting alKulayni in a clear manner, or expressing distrnst in him or rejecting
his view on this issue. In fact, some have tried in a twisted manner to
defend him and find excuses for him.798

If these people are sincere, then they have to disavow anyone
who says that the noble Qur'an has been distorted, and they should
not hesitate to regard as a disbeliever anyone who denies a single
word of the Qur'an. They should realise that denying some of it is
like denying all of it, because that is clearly undermining what is
proven from the Prophet (g)
and what is the foundation of Islam,
according to all Muslims.
The noble Qur'an is the divine Book that has not been
subjected to any alteration or change because Allah (&) promised
and guaranteed to preserve it, unlike the Torah and Gospel. Allah

482

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

(iE)did not guarantee to preserve them; He made it the responsibility
of the people, but they neglected their duty. Ash-Shicibi narrated
from Abu 'Umar ad-Dhi that Abu d-Hasan al-Munt2b said: "I was
with d-Qi& Abu Ishiq Ismi'eel ibn Ishiq one day, and it was said to
him: 'Why was it possible for the people of the Torah to alter it and
not possible for the people of the Qur'an?' Al-Qidi said: 'AUah ( B )
says concerning the people of the Torah: %Forto them was entrusted
the protection of Allah's BookB (Qur'an 5: 44), so He delegated the
preservation of it to them; hence alteration was possible in their case.
And Allah (%) says: #Verily We: it is We Who have sent down the
Dhikr [i.e. the Qur'an] and surely, We will guard it [from
conuption]) (Qur'an 15: 9). So it is not possible for anyone to alter it.'
'Ali (&) said: 'I went to Abu Abdullah al-Muhbili and told him
what I had heard, and he said: "I have never heard anything better
than this.""'799
The Ummah throughout the ages has agreed that the noble
Qur'an that Allah ( B )revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (g)
is
the Qur'an that is now extant among the Muslims; nothing has been
added or taken away, and nothing has been changed or altered. It is
not possible for anything of that nature to happen to it because of the
promise from AUah (&) to preserve and protect it. No one disagrees
with this except the R%i& Shia who claimed that the noble Qur'an
has been subjected to distortion, changes and alterations and that the
Companions are the ones who distorted the Qur'an for their own
worldly interests. This belief of theirs is false, and there is evidence
from the noble Qur'an, the words of the Imams of Ah1 al-Bayt and
common sense. We will discuss this in detail:

3.5.1.a. Evidence from the Noble Qur'an
The verses which clearly state that Allah (&) has guaranteed
to preserve the Qur'an and that it cannot be subjected to any
distortion or alteration are numerous and include the following:

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

483

$Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr [i.e. the Qur'an]
and surely, We will guard it [from cormption].)
(Qur'an 15: 9)
(And recite what has been revealed to you [0 Mnhammad] of the
Book [the Qur'an] of your Lord [i.e. recite it, understand and follow
its teachings and act on its orders and preach it to men]. None can
change His Words, and none will you find as a refuge other than
Him.$
(Qur'an 18: 27)
(Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it, [it is] sent
down by the AU-Wise, Worthy of all praise.)
(Qur'an 41: 42)

alif-Um-Meem. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur'an
and none but AUah (Alone) knows their meanings.] This is the Book
[the Qur'an], whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to those who are
Al-Muttaqoon [the pious].$
(Qur'an 2: 1-2)
$Alif-Lh-Ri [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur'an and
none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings]. [This is] a Book, the
Verses whereof are perfected [in evev sphere of knowledge], and
then explained in detail from One [AUah], Who is All-Wise WellAcquainted [with all things1.B
(Qur'an 11: 1)
(Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you but when
he did recite the Revelation or narrated or spoke, Satan threw [some
falsehood] in it. But Allah abolishes that which Satan throws in. Then
AUah establishes His Revelations. And Allah is All-Knower, AUwise.)
(Qur'an 22: 52)
(Move not your tongue concerning [the Qur'an, 0 Muhammad] to
make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and to give you [O
Muhammad] the ability to recite it [the Qur'an].) (Qur'an 75: 16-17)
These verses clearly indicate that Allah (&) is preserving His
Book and confirming its verses, that no falsehood can come to it from

4

'Ali's attitude towards the Kha+tes and Shia

before it or behind it, and that (Allah's Promise is the Truth; and
whose words can be truer than those of Allah?%(Qur'an 4: 122).
These verses, which state that Allah (&) will preserve His
Book and protect it from distortion or alteration, are so clear that
there is no need for further explanation or clarification. Similarly,
Allah (&)praises the Companions (may Allah he pleased with them)
in the noble Qur'an, which confirms that what the Rifi& Shia claim
about their having distorted the Qur'an is a lie.800Allah 1%) says:
B ~ n the
d foremost to embrace Islam of the Muh2jirCm and the An&
and also those who followed them exactly [in Faith]. Allah is wellpleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has
prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow [paradise], to
dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.) (Qur'an 9: 100)
(Indeed, Allah was pleased with the believers when they gave the
Bay'ah [pledge] to you [0 Muhammad] under the tree, He knew
what was in their hearts, and He sent down As-Sakeenah [calmness
and tranquillity] upon them, and He rewarded them with a near
victory.8
(Qur'an 48: 18)
There are other verses as well that praise the Companions; we
will discuss and explain them in more detail below.
After quoting these two types of verses (those that speak of the
Qur'an being protected from distortion and those that contain praise
for the Companions), we say to the RZfidi Shia: Your view that the
Qur'an has been distorted is contradicted by these verses in which
Allah (&.)co~ltirmsthat this Qur'an has not been distorted and will
never he distorted because He is the One who has guaranteed to
preserve it and protect it from distortion and alteration. He also
praised in the highest terms the Companions of His Prophet (g),
whom you have accused of distorting the Qur'an; He described them
as having been sincere and having believed in Allah and His

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

485

Messenger. So you have one of two options with regard to these
verses:
1) You admit and acknowledge that these verses came from
Allah (&), in which case you have no choice but to accept
and believe what these verses indicate, namely the
soundness of the noble Qur'an and its being free of any
distortion or alteration; or

(s),

2) You deny that it is from AUah
which is disbelief in
Allah because the one who denies a single verse of the
Qur'an and believes that it cannot be soundly atbibuted to
Allah is a disbeliever, according to the consensus of all
~uslims.~~'

3.5.1.b. Evidence from the words of their Imams
There are many reports from their Imams, whom they regard
as infallible, in which they urge the Shia to adhere to the Book of
Allah and to refer everything to the Qur'an and Sunnah.
One of these reports says that Moosa ihn Ja'far was asked: "Do
you find everything you need in the Qur'an and Sunnah, or do you
have your own opinions?" He replied: "No, everything is in the Book
of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet (@)."802
It was narrated that Ahdullah said: "Whoever goes against the
Book of AUah and the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad (g)
is a
disbeliever."803 It was narrated from Ahu Ja'far that he said: "Allah,
may He be blessed and exalted, has not omitted anything the Ummah
needs hut He has revealed it in His Book and explained it to His
Messenger (@). He has set a limit for all things and sent proof to
indicate it."8M It ww narrated that Abu Abdullah said: "There is
nothing but there is something in the Qur'an or Sunnah about it."805
The one who studies these reports will learn two important
things:

486

'Ali's anitude towards the Khari~itesand Shia

'*

The Imams of AN al-Bayt, like others of the early
generations of this Ummah, believed in the soundness of
the noble Qnr'an; otherwise they would not have asked
their followers to adhere to the Book of Allah and the
Sunnah of His Prophet (B)
and rejected everything else.
Moreover, they told them that there is nothing that is not
addressed in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah, and they
said that they did not have anything that was not in these
two sources.

*:*

There are reports attributed to the Imams that say that the
Qur'an wwas distorted, but they did not actually say that.
They are innocent of it and have nothing to do with those
who fabricated these reports.'06

3.5.l.c. Rational evidence
Just as the reports of the Qur'an and Sunnah show that the
claims of the R=&s about the distortion of the noble Qur'an are
false, reason also indicates that these claims are false. That is because
of the serious implications of saying that the Qur'an has been
distorted; it implies slander against Allah ( B )and against the
Prophet (g)
and his Companions (&), as well as the pure Imams of
Ah1 alBayt. It is a slander against h a h (&) because it implies that
He did not keep his promise to protect the Qnr'an -exalted be Allah
because it
far above that. It is a slander against the Prophet (g)
implies that he did not convey the noble Qur'an completely, that he
told many verses to 'Ali (&) only and not to anyone else. It is a
slander against the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them),
whom the R s d i Shia accuse of distorting the Qnr'an for their own
interests. It is a slander against 'Ali and the Imams who came after
him because it implies that they did not convey to the people the
Qur'an that they had, and they did not call the the people to it. That
constitutes concealing the Book of Allah, and Allah (&) wamed

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

487

against that: (Verily, those who conceal the clear proofs, evidences
and the guidance, which We have sent down, after We have made it
clear for the people in the Book, they are the ones cursed by Allah
and cursed by the cursers.B (Qur'an 2: 159)
If the R%i& Shia accepted only rational evidence, then the
negative implications resulting from this foul belief would have been
the greatest deterrent. It would have compelled them to give up this
belief and repent to Allah (s)from everything that they have
fabricated against Him, His Prophet (@), the noble Companions of
His Prophet and the pure Ah1 a l - ~ a ~ t . ' "

3.5.2. Their belief that the Q d a n is not binding
proof (meaning that it is invalid) unless
the one who is in charge of it is present
Al-Kulayni, the author of Urool al-K@?, which for the Shia is
like Sahih Bukhari is for Ah1 as-~unnah,'~'nmated: 'The Qur'an is
not binding proof unless the one who is in charge of it is present. 'Ali
(4)
was in charge of the Qur'an, and obedience to him was
obligatory, and he was the proof against the people after the
Messenger of ~ l l a h . '09
" This view is to be found in a number of their
main books, such as Rijcil a l - ~ a s h s h i , ~'Zlal
' ~ ash-~hara^'i,8~'
al~ a h & s i s i nWask'il
, ~ ~ ~ a u h - ~ h i ' a h ~and
' ~ others. How can such a thing
be said of the Book of Allah (%), which He revealed as guidance to
mankind, saying: (Verily, this Qur'an guides to that which is most
just and right) (Qur'an 17: Y)?
The Rightly Guided Caliph 'Ali (&) said: "The Book of
Allah contains stories of what came before you, news of what is to
come after you and rulings to judge between you; it is serious and not
in jest. Any tyrant who abandons it, Allah will destroy him; whoever
seeks guidance in anything other than it, AUah will send him astray.
It is the strong rope, the wise reminder and the straight path. It is that

488

'Ali'sattitude towards the Khurijites and Shia

which cannot be affected by whims and desires. Tongues will not
stumble over it, its wonders will never end and the people of
knowledge will never tire of it. The one who quotes from it will be
speaking the truth, the one who acts upon it will be rewarded, the one
who judges in accordance with it will be just, and the one who calls
others to it will guide them to a straight path."814
Ibn 'Abbis (&) said: "Allah makes a guarantee to the one
who reads the Qur'an and acts upon it that be will not go astray in this
world and will not be doomed in the hereafter." Then he recited this
verse: (He [Allah] said: 'Get you down [from the paradise to the
earth], both of yon, together, some of you are an enemy to some
others. Then if there comes to you guidance from Me, then whoever
follows My Guidance he shall neither go astray, nor shall be
distressed.'b (Qur'an 20: 123)

In the Shias' own books, in their most reliable sources, there
are reports narrated from Ah1 al-Bayt that contradict this view of
theirs. For example: "When you become confused by turmoils Wte
pieces of black night, then refer to the Qur'an, for it will be an
intercessor whose intercession will be accepted; whoever follows it,
it will lead him to paradise, but whoever puts it behind his back, it
will drive him to hell. And it is the guide to the best way."815In Nalzj
al-BalZghah, which is attributed to 'Ali (&) and considered one of
their most hvstworthy references, it says: "The Qur'an commands
and rebukes, is silent yet speaks, and it is the proof of Allah
against His creation."816

(s)

There are other texts that support these reports and highlight
the extent of the contradiction and confusion found in the sources of
these people. Since their reports - as you can see - contradict one
another, they came up with a dangerous methodology, which is to
adopt the view that is contrary to what the Muslim masses (meaning
Ah1 as-Sunnah wal-Jami'ah) believe. Anyone who studies this view,

'Aliibn Abi T6lib

489

which is narrated in the hooks of the Shia, will realise that it was
introduced by an enemy who was filled with resentment and hatred
and who wanted to turn the Shia away from the Book of Allah (&)
and lead them astray from His guidance.
The Shiite view connects the validity of the Qur'an to the
presence of the one who is supposed to be in charge of it, which is
one of the twelve Imam, since the Qur'an was explained to 'Ali, and
he transmitted the knowledge of the Qur'an to the rest of the twelve
Imams. Each Imam passed on this knowledge to the one who came
after him until it ended with the twelfth Imam. According to the
Twelvers, he is absent and has been lost for more than eleven
centnries, hut some Shiite and other groups believe that he does not
exist. As long as the validity of the Qur'an is linked to this absent or
missing Imani, the logical conclusion is that the validity of the
Qur'an is suspended now because of the absence or non-existence of
the one who is supposed to be in charge of it. Under these
circumstances, the Book cannot be referred to or quoted as evidence
because what counts as evidence is the word of the Imam only, and
the Imam is absent. Therefore the Shiite view is that the Qur'an
cannot be used as evidence. That is sufficient misguidance, and it
diverts people away from the Book of Allah, hut that is not the end of
the conspiracy against the Book of Allah and the Shia. It is just one
link in the chain, one in a series of conspiracies aimed at turning the
Shia away from the Book of Allah (3&).817
It is a well-established fact in Islam that knowledge of the
noble Qur'an was not a secret to be transmitted through a certain line,
and 'Ali
did not receive any special treatment in that regard to
the exclusion of the other Companions of the Messenger of Allah
(g).
The Companions (&) were the pioneers who had the honour
of receiving this Qur'an from the Messenger of mankind Muhammad
(g)
and transmitting it to all generations. The Shia, however, went

(4)

490

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

against this principle. They believe that Allah (&) singled out their
twelve Imams for knowledge of the entire Qur'an, that the Imams are
the only ones who can interpret it, and that whoever seeks knowledge
of the Qur'an from anyone else has gone astray.818 Some Sunni
sources state that the origin and roots of this view go back to Ibn
Saba', who said: "The Qur'an is one of nine parts, and its knowledge
is with ' ~ l i . "IS
~ ~view
~ is mentioned frequently in the books of
the Twelver Shia, in various kinds of reports, as we shall see below.
In a lengthy report in Ufool al-Ktfi, it is umated that Abu
Abdullah said: "The Qur'an would be sufficient for the people if they
could find someone to interpret it. The Messenger of Allah (g)
explained it to one man, and he explained it to the Imams; that man is
'Ali ibn Abi ~ 2 i h . In
" ~a ~number
~
of Shiite sources, which they
consider reliable, it is narrated that the Messenger of Allah (g)
said:
"Allah sent the Qur'an down to me. Whoever goes against it will go
astray, and whoever seeks knowledge of it with anyone other than
'Ali is doomed."8z' The books of the Shia also claim that Abu Ja'far
said: "0 Qatgdah, are you the jurist of the people of Basra?' He
replied: "That is what they say." Abu Ja'far (&) said: "I have heard
that you interpret the Qur'an?" Qatgdah said to him: "Yes." ... He
said: "Woe to yon, 0 Qat%dah,the Qur'an can only be known by the
one to whom it is addressed."822
They have very many reports of this nature, which could fill an
entire volume. They all emphasise the same concept: that "only the
twelve Imams have knowledge of the Qur'an, and it is kept with
them, and through it they know all things."823The response to that is
what Allah (&) said to those who sought a sign to prove the
truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (g):
(Is it not sufficient for
them that We have sent down to you the Book [the Qur'an] which is
recited to them?b (Qur'an 29: 51) The noble Qur'an is the witness, the
evidence and the proof. Whoever seeks knowledge of the Qur'an

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

491

from the Qur'an or from the Sunnah of the Prophet (@) or from the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (s),
including 'Ali, will be
guided.
This notion - that the one seeking knowledge of the Qur'an
from anyone other than 'Ali is doomed -is not part of Islam, and it
is known to he false beyond any doubt. The Prophet (@J did not
single out any one of his Companions for knowledge of Sharia to the
exclusion of others. AUah
says: h d We have also sent down
unto you [0Muhammad] the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the
Qur'an)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to
them%(Qur'an 16: 44). This verse proves that explanation of the
Qur'an is for all people, not just one individual or group, even if they
are members of his household. Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) stated
that the Messenger of Allah
did not single him out for specific
knowledge to the exclusion of other people.824 The Prophet ( g )
addressed his Companions and those who came after them and
encouraged them to convey his Sunnah, and he did not single out one
of them in that regard. He said: "May Allah make his face radiant, the
one who hears the hadith from us and memorises it so that he can
convey it to others, because it may be that a person who has some
knowledge hut does not fully understand it may convey it to someone
who has better understanding than him."825 This hadith was also
narrated in the major reference books of the Twelver hia as,"^ and it
will count as evidence against them.

(s)

a)

Let us consider the claims that the noble Qur'an was not
addressed to anyone but the twelve Imams, that no one knows the
Qur'an except them and that the Qur'an is only understood by those
to whom it is addre~sed."~According to this sick understanding, the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (@), the Tgbi'oon and the
leading scholars of Islam throughout the ages would he regarded as
being doomed and as causing the doom of others because they

492

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

j

interpret the Qur'an properly, or because they believe that there are
things in the Book of Allah that no one has any excuse for not
knowing. Some of this is known by the Arabs because of their
language, some of it cannot he interpret fully by anyone except the
scholars, and there is some that no one knows the interpretation of
except Allah ( B ) . ' ~ ~
The Shia maintain that no one understands the Qur'an except
the Imams, and that they h o w the entire Qur'an. This is a claim that
requires evidence, and it is refuted on the basis of both reason and
reports. It should be noted that the Prophet ( g ) explained to his
Companions the meaning of the Qur'an as well as its words. The
verse $And We have also sent down unto you [0Muhammad] the
Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Qur'an)], that you may
explain clearly to men what is sent down to them,) (Qur'an 16: 44)
refers to both the meanings and the words.
Abu 'Abdur-Rwan as-Sulami said: "Those who taught us
the Qur'an - such as 'Uthmk ibn ' M a n , Abdullah ihn Mas'ood
and others - told us that when they learned ten verses from the
Prophet ( g ) , they would not move on until they had learned what
they contined of knowledge and righteous deeds. They said: 'So we
leamed the Qur'an and knowledge and righteous deeds dl
together.1,1829 Hence they used to spend some time memorising each
soorah, because Allah (g)
says:
B m i s is] a Book [the Qur'an] which We have sent down to you, full
of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of
understanding may remember.)
(Qur'an 38: 29)
#Do they not then consider the Qur'an carefully?B (Qur'an 4: 82)
(Have they not pondered over the Word [of Allah, i.e. what is sent
down to the Prophet]...?)
(Qur'an 23: 68)

Pondering over the Qur'an without understanding its
meanings is not possible. Allah (&) says: e e r i l y , We have sent it
down as an Arabic Qur'an inorder that you may understand) (Qur'm
12: 2). Understanding the Qur'an means comprehending it, and it is
well known that the point of any statement is that its meaning should
be understood. A statement is not mere words, and this is even more
important in the case of the Qur'an.
For these reasons, one group of Shia no longer accepted or
believed in this view. They said that the apparent meanings of the
Qur'an are not something that is known exclusively to the Twelvers,
and that others could understand them too, but as for the hidden
meanings of the verses, that is something that is known to the Imams
alone. Thus there was a major debate between the two groups as to
whether the apparent meanings of the Qur'an are hinding. The former
group believe that no one knows the meaning of the entire Qur'an,
both apparent and hidden, except the Imams; the latter group believes
that the apparent meanings of the Qur'an are binding because of the
general meaning of the call to ponder and understand the ~ u r ' a n . ~ ~ '
The claim that the Qur'an was interpreted for 'Ali (&) alone
contrary to the words of Allah (&): (With clear signs i d Books
[We sent the Messengers]. And We have also sent down unto you [0
Muhammad] the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Qur'an)],
that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them, and
that they may give thought) (Qur'an 16: 44). The clear signs are for all
people, not for 'Ali (&) alone, as we have stated above. A person
who denies that is left with one of two options: either to say that the
Messenger did not convey what was revealed to him, or to reject what
the Qur'an says, which is contrary to reason and the well established
principles of Islam.
The claim that knowledge of the Qur'an was given exclusively
to the Imams is contrary to the fact that a large number of the

494

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Companions of the Messenger of Allah (B)were well known for
interpreting the Qur'an, including the first four Caliphs, Ibn Mas'ood,
Ibn 'Abbis, Zayd ibn Thkbit and others. 'Ali (&) praised the
interpretation of Ibn 'Abb% (&).Y31
Ibn Taymiyah said: "A great
deal of commentary on the Qur'an was transmitted from Ibn 'Abbb
with proven chains of narration, and there is little mention of 'Ali in
these reports. Ibn 'AbbO narrated from more than one of the
Companions; he narrated from 'Umar, Abu Hurayrah, 'AbdurR&miiu ibn 'Awf, Zayd ibn Thibit, Ubayy ibn Ka'b, U s h a h ibn
Zayd and others among the Muhiijireen and An$&, but the reports he
narrated from 'Ali are very few. The authors of the sound collections
of hadiths did not narrate any of the hadiths of Ibn 'Abbb about
Qur'an interpretation from 'Ali, although they narrated his hadiths
from 'Umar, Abdur-R&rn%n ibn 'Awf, Abn Hurayrah and others.
There is no book of Qur'an interpretation known to the Muslirns that is
proven to be from 'Ali. These books of hadiths and commentary on the
Qur'an are filled with reports from the Companions and Tiibi'een, but
what is narrated from 'Ali is very little, and what is narratedof Qur'an
interpretation from Ja'far as-Siidiq is falsely attributed to ~ a ' f a r . " ~ ~ ~
Ja'far spoke about how people were keen to attribute
fabricated statements to him and said that their idea that knowledge
of the Qur'an was given exclusively to 'Ali leads to undermining the
fact that the Qur'an was transmitted from the Companions to
subsequent generations in mutawztir repofls, because it was not
transmitted - according to their claim - from the Messenger of
Allah (g)
except by one person, namely 'Ali (&). This view is a
conspiracy aimed at keeping people away from the Book of Allah
and making them turn away from pondering it, seeking its guidance,
thinking about the lessons it contains, and studying its meanings.
According to the Shiite religion, there is no way to understand the
meanings of the Qur'an except through the twelve Imams; everyone
else is deprived of benefiting from it. This is an attempt or a mck with

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

495

a clear aim, because the Qur'an was revealed by Allah (&) in a plain
Arabic tongue and is addressed to all people: e e r i l y , We have sent it
down as an Arabic Qur'an in order that you may understand.)
(Qur'an 12: 2)

(This [the Qw'anl is a plain statement for mankind, a guidance and
instruction to those who are Al-Muttaqoon [the pious].B
(Qur'an 3: 138)

Allah (&) has commanded His slaves to ponder it, learn its
lessons and heed its prohibitions. It does not make sense to say to
someone who does not understand what is said to him: "Ponder that
of which you have no understanding or knowledge."833 This is an
attempt to turn people away from that great store of knowledge of the
interpretation of the Qur'an that was transmitted to us by the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g),
the early generations of
the Urnrnah and the scholars. This great treasure has no value or
worth, according to the Shiite religion, because it was not narrated
from the twelve Imams. Some of their contemporary sbaykhs have
stated this clearly, saying: "All the commentary on the Qur'an that
was narrated from anyone except Ah1 d-Bayt is of no value and is not
to be taken into c ~ n s i d e r a t i o n . " ~ ~ ~
Their main books of Qur'an interpretation, such as those of d Qummi, al-'Iykhi, as-Sifi and al-Burhk, and their main hooks of
hadith, such as al-Kifiand BiGr al-Anwcir,have tried to give
interpretations of the Book of Allah which are attributed to Ah1 alBayt. In most cases, though, their interpretations demonstrate blatant
ignorance of the Book of Allah and a deviant interpretation of its
verses. Their explanations are very twisted and cannot be soundly
attributed to the scholars among Ah1 d-Bayt, because they have no
connection to the meaning of the words; they are not indicated by the
words or by the Qur'anic context, as we shall see below. According
to this belief, this is supposed to represent the best knowledge of the

496

Xli's attitude towards the Khar+es and Shia

scholars of Ah1 al-Bayt; in fact, it undermines them and athibutes a
great deal of ignorance to them by people who claim to love and
support them.835

3.5.3. Their belief that the Qur'an has
hidden meanings that are different
from its apparent meanings
The Shia are of the view that the Qur'an has apparent and
hidden meanings, and that the people only know the apparent
meanings; as for the hidden meanings, no one knows themexcept the
Imams and those who learn from them. With such ideas, they opened
the door to heretics, followers of whims and desires and destructive
sects to tamper with the Qur'an. They all tried to plot against it and
wanted to extinguish the light of Islam with their fabrications, but
Allah (&)will complete His light even if the polytheists hate it. The
Shia exploited this idea of apparent and hidden meanings to try to
interpret the Qur'an to he in accordance with their beliefs and to serve
their ideas about imamate. They also took the Qur'an as a means to
attack and condemn the Companions (may Allah be pleased with
them), while at the same time praising Ah1 al-Bayt and attributing to
them things that they themselves would deny. In this regard, the
Rifidi Shia came up with views that contradict everything that was
narrated about the interpretation of the Qur'an, views for which there
is no support on the basis of reports, reason, Arabic language or
The roots of the esoteric interpretation go hack to the Saha'i
groups. Ibn Saba' tried to find support in the Book of Allah, by
meals of esoteric misinterpretations,for his idea that the Prophet (.&)
would come hack to life. He said: "It is strange that those who claim
that 'Eesa will come hack to life do not believe that Muhammad will
come back to life when Allah (&) says: PIVerily, He Who has given

and others narrated from alMugheerah ibn Sa'eed, who was one of the extremists according to

also narrated many other reports of this type.$" It may be noted that
al-Ash'ari, d-Baghdadi, Ibn Hazm and Nishwk d-mmyari were all
agreed that Jihir dJa'fi, who wrote the first Shia book of Qur'an
interpretation using that esoteric methodology, was the successor of
d-Mugheerah ibn ~ a ' e e d , ~who
~ ' said that what was meant by the
Satan in the Qur'an was Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Umar. These people
were dangerous elements who were leaming from one another, and
that led to the corruption of hii ism.'^'
The Shaykh of the Shia of his era - and this is who they refer
to when they use the title 'd-'Allhah' - wbose name was Ibn d Mutahhar al-Hilli, quoted evidence for 'Ali's entitlement to the
imamate (caliphate) by saying: 'The thirtieth piece of evidence is the
verse in which Allah (&) says: dHe has let loose the two seas [the
salt and fresh water] meeting together. Between them is a bamer
which none of them can transgress.) (Qur'an 55: 19-20)." He said that
this refers to 'Ali and Fi@mah; that dBetween them is a barrier which
none of them can transgressb refers to the Prophet (@); and that dOut
of them both come out pearl and cordb (Qur'an 55: 22) refers to d Hasan and d-Hnsayn.
When Ihn d-Mutahhar quoted that as evidence, Ihn Taymiyah
said: "This man and his ilk say things that they do not understand,
and it is more like delirium than interpretation of the Qur'an. It is akin
to the interpretation of the heretics and Qar2mifah of the Qur'an.
Indeed it is worse than much of that; it is the way in which the
heretics seek to undermine the Qur'an. Interpreting the Qur'an in this
way is one of the greatest ways of maligning it."853
The following are some examples of the ways in which the
Rifitfidi Shia distorted the verses of the noble Qur'an because they
opened the door wide to esoteric interpretations:

iI

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

499

3.5.3.a. Their distortion of the meaning of tawheed,
which is the foundation of the religion,
to mean entitlement t o the imamate
It was narrated from Abu Ja'far that he said: "Allah never sent
any Prophet except with loyalty to our imamate and disavowal of our
enemies.8s4That is what Allah referred to when He said in His Book:
(And verily, We have sent among every Ummah [community, nation]
a Messenger [proclaiming]: 'Worship Allah [Alone], and avoid [or
keep away from] Tdghoot [all false deities, i.e. do not worship
Tzghoot besides Allah].') (Qur'hn 16: 36)"

3.5.3.b. Their distortion of the concept of
divinity to mean imamate
With regard to the verse, {And Allah said [0 mankind!]:
"T&e not iliihain [two gods in worship]. Verily, He [Allah] is [the]
only One Zldh [God]..."# (Qur'an 16: 51), Abu Abdullah said: "What
is meant by that is: Do not take two Imams; he is only one Imam."855

3.5.3.c. Their distortion of the meaning

second one (meaning 'Umar ibn al-Kha@ih); he was a helper against
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (7g&)."856
Al-Kiishzni said in al-Ba~d'irthat al-Biiqir was asked about
the interpretation of this verse, and he said: "This verse has a hidden
meaning, and the words 'his Lord' refer to 'Ali, since 'Ali is his lord
in the context of imamate."ss7

500

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

3.5.3.d. Their distortion of the meanings
of the w o r d 'Word' to mean the Imams
They said with regard to the interpretation of the verse: &d
had it not been for a decisive Word [gone forth already], the matter
would have been judged between themb (Qur'an 42: 21), "The Word
is the ham."858
With regard to the verse: NO change can there he in the Words
of Allahb (Qur'an 10: 64), they said, "There can be no change in the
imamate."859
3.5.3.e. Their distortion of the meanings
of the words 'mosque', 'Ka'bah' and
'qiblah' to m e a n the Imams
With regard to the verse: (You should face Him only in each
and every place of worship [masjiab (Qur'an 7: 29), they interpreted
the word masjid (which is literally a place of prostration, but
normally means a mosque) as meaning the Imams.860With regard to
the verse: (Wear your beautiful apparel at every time and place of
prayer [masjid) (Qur'an 7: 31), they said, "It [masjid] means the
With regard to the verse, $And the mosques are for Allah

~ ~ equate 'prostration' in the Qur'an with loving and
supporting the Imams, so they interpret the verse: m e y used to be
called to prostrate themselves [offer prayers], while they were
healthy and good [in the life of the world, hut they did not]) (Qur'an
68: 43), as meaning: "They were called to support the imamate of 'Ali
in this world."864

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

501

3.5.3.f. Their distorting the meaning of repentance
in the Qur'an to m e a n recanting love and support
of Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmin,
a n d loving and supporting 'Ali only
With regard to the verse: (SO forgive those who repent and
follow Your way) (Qur'an 40: 7), the interpretation according to them
came in three reports:
1) 'So forgive those who repent' means those who repent from
having supported and loved Abu Bakr, 'Umar and the
Umayyads.

2) 'So forgive those who repent' means those who have repented
from supporting and loving the three evil idols (meaning Abu
Bakr, 'Umar and 'UthmZn) and the Umayyads, while 'and
follow Your way' refers to the love and support of 'Ali.
3)

'So forgive those who repent' means those who repent from
supporting and loving these three and the Umayyads, while 'and
follow Your way', refers to Amir al-Mu'mineen ( ' ~ l i ) . ~ ~ ~

All three reports are attributed to Abu Ja'far Muhammad d BZqir, but his knowledge and religious commitment prove that this
cannot be true.866
These are just a few of their many false interpretations. Their
sources for Qur'an interpretation are mostly based on this esoteric
methodology of interpretation, which they adopted from Abu d Khat$ib, JZbir dJa'fi, d-Mugheerah ibn Sa'eed and other
extremists. It may be noted that in the fifth century AH, their experts
in Qur'an interpretation tried to correct that extreme approach of
esoteric interpretation. Their prominent shaykh, Abu Ja'far
Muhammad ibn al-Hasan at-Toosi (d. 460 AH) wrote a book of
Qur'an interpretation in which he hied to eliminate or reduce the
obvious exaggeration found in the commentary of d-Qumrni and al-

502

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

'Ayyishi and in U ~ o o al-K@?
l
and other books. Even though he
defended the fundamentals of his sect and affirmed their innovated
principles, he did not sink to the level to which al-Qummi and those
who were influenced by him sank. Similar to at-Toosi in this
methodology was al-Fad1 ibn al-Hasan at-Tuhrusi, in Majma' alBay&. Ibn Taymiyah referred to that when he said: "At-Toosi, and
those who are like him in their Quran interpretation, drew upon the
commentaries of Ahl as-Sunnah; there is no useful knowledge in
their commentary that was not taken from the commentaries of Ah1
as-~unnah."'~~

3.6. The attitude of the Imami Shia
towards the noble Companions
The attitude of the R%& Shia towards the Companions of the
Prophet (g)
is one of enmity, hatred, resentment and grudges. That
is clear from the extensive criticism of the Companions that fills their
books, both classical and contemporq. For example, they believe
that all hut a few of the Companions became disbelievers and
apostates; this i s mentioned clearly in reports included in what they
consider to be the soundest and most trustworthy of their books. AlKnlayni narrated from Abu Ja'far that he said: "The people all
became apostates after the death of the Prophet (B)except three."
The narrator said: "Who are those three?" He said: "Al-Miqdid ihn
al-Aswad, Abu Dharr al-Gbifiiri and SalmZn al-F%isi (may the mercy
and blessings of Allah he upon them)." Then he mentioned a few
other people and said: "These are the ones who were tested and
refused to swear allegiance until 'Ali was brought and swore
allegiance reluctantly to Abu ~ a k r . " ' ~ '
Ni'matullah alJaz2'iri said: "The Imamis believe in a clear
and unambiguous instruction from the Prophet (@) that 'Ali was to
be his successor, and they regard the Companions as disbelievers and

'Ali ibn Abi TZlib

503

impugn them. According to them, the imamate went to Ja'far asS2diq and after him, to his children the infallible ones, upon whom be
peace. The author of this book is one of this group, and it (that group)
is the one that will be saved in~hallah."'~~
The R Z d i Shias' accusations against the Companions do not
end with this belief that they became disbelievers and apostates. They
believe that they are the worst of Allah's creation and that belief in
Allah and His Messenger cannot be sound except by disavowing
them, especially the three caliphs Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmh,
and some of the Mothers of the ~ e l i e v e r s . ~ ~ ~
Muhammad Bfiqir al-Majlisi said: "Our belief concerning
disavowal is that we disavow the four idols: Abu Bakr, 'Umar,
'Uthmin and Muu'2wiyah,and the four women: 'kishah, Haf~ah,
Hind and Umm al-Hakam; and all their supporters and followers.
They are the worst of AUah's creation on the face of the earth, and
belief in Allah and His Messenger and the Imams cannot be complete
except by disavowal of their ene~nies."'~'
Their hatred towards the Companions of the Prophet (g)
bas
gone so far that they regard it as permissible to curse them; in fact,
they seek to draw close to Allah by means of that in ways that cannot
be described. Mullah K a a i m narrated from Abu Hamzah athT h d - in a fabrication attributed to Zayn &'Abideen (may
Allah have mercy on him) - that he said: "Whoever curses al-Jibt
wat-Gghoot [meaning Abu Bakr and 'Umar] once, Allah
will
record for him seventy million good deeds, erase from him seventy
million bad deeds and raise him in status by seventy million degrees.
Whoever curses them once in the evening will have the same
recorded for him. Our master 'Ali ibn al-Husayn passed away, so I
entered upon our master Abn Ja'far Muhammad al-Bsqir, and said:
'0 our master, a hadith that I beard from your father.' He said: 'Tell
me, 0 Thamsi.' I repeated the badith to him, and he said: 'Yes, 0

(a)

504

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Tharnai, do you want me to give you more? I said: 'Of course, 0 my
master.' He said: 'Whoever curses them once every morning will not
have any sin recorded for him during that day until evening comes,
and whoever curses them once in the evening will not have any sin
recorded for him during that night until morning comes."'87z
One of their famous supplications is one called 'the
supplication of the two idols of Quraysh' (meaning Abu Bakr and
'Umar), which is narrated in the books of remembrances. They
attribute this supplication wrongly and falsely to 'Ali (&), and it is
more than a page and a half long. In it are the words: ' ' ~ ~ l l a send
h,
blessings upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, and curse
the two idols of Quraysh and their two Jibts and their two Tgghoots
and their two lies and their two daughters, who went against Your
command, denied Your revelation, denied Your blessings, disobeyed
Your Messenger, altered Your religion and distorted Your book ..."
and at the end: "0 Allah, curse them in secret and openly, an eternal,
everlasting, unceasing and never-ending curse, a curse that has a
beginning but does not have an end, for them and their helpers and
supporters, those who love them and take them as friends, those who
submit to them and are inclined towards them, those who defend
them, accept their words and believe what they say. (Say four times:)
0 Allah, punish them with a punishment that the people of hell pray
not be punished in that way. k e e n , 0 Lord of the
This supplication is encouraged among them to the extent that
they narrated reports concerning its virtue that they attribute to Ibn
'AbhL. They claim that he said: '"Ali (B)
used to recite this
supplication in his prayers, and he said: 'The one who recites it is like
one who shot an arrow with the Prophet (gg)
at Badr, Uhud and
Hunayn, one million arrows."'874 Hence their scholars paid a griat
deal of attention to this supplication, to the extent that Agha Barzak
at-Tahrki stated that ten books were written commenting on it.875

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

505

This is what is mentioned in their ancient books and on the lips
of their earlier scholars. With regard to their contemporary scholars,
they believe the same as their predecessors and adhere to it. Their
venerated imam and 'Grand Ayatollah' Khomeini writes the
following in his book Kashf al-Asr6r:
-

"We have nothing to do with these two shaykhs [Abu Bakr and
'Umar] and what they did of actions contrary to the Qur'an,
toying with the rulings of Allah and what they deemed to be
h d 2 or harim on the basis of their own views, and what they did
of injustice against Fitimah, the daughter of the Prophet (g)
and
against her children. But we should point out their ignorance of
the rulings of Allah and of slam."^^^
Concerning the two shaykhs [Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah
be pleased with them)]: "Here we h d ourselves forced to quote
examples of their clearly going against the Qur'an to prove that
they were against it."877

-

Accusing them of distorting the Qur'an: "Allah mentioned eight
categories of people who are entitled to a share of zakih, but
Abn Bakr omitted one of these groups on the basis of advice
from 'Umar, and the Muslims did not say anything."878

-

"In fact, they did not give proper respect to the Messenger, who
had striven hard and borne calamities in order to guide them, and
when he closed his eyes (died), the words of the son of d Khat&b, which were based on fabrication and which stemmed
from deeds of disbelief and heresy, were ringing in his ears."879

There are contemporary voices, such as al-Khunayzi, A h a d
Mughniyah, ar-RiE'i and Muhammad Jawid Mughniyah, who call
for rapprochement between the Shia and Ah1 as-Sunnah and who
claim to respect the Companions. They should state their view openly
by praising the Companions in the midst of the Shia, they should

506

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

strive to cleanse the Shiite legacy of everything that is contrary to the
Book of AUah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, and they should
stand up to the contemporary Shiite shaykhs who are still jabbering
about these misguided notions. They should not ignore what is
mentioned in their books, both classical and contemporary, and what
is taking place in real life among their common folk and shaykhs
alike. They should be sincere and not contradict themselves, and only
then we might accept what they say.880
The belief of the R%i& Shia about the Companions is to be
found in the reference hooks on which their madh-hab is based.
There is slander, impugning, reviling and foul talk that people with
dignity and religious commitment would refrain from uttering
towards the worst disbelievers. Yet we see that the Rsifidi Shia are
happy with these words that they speak against the Companions of
the Messenger of Allah (B)and his successors (caliphs), advisors
and in-laws, and they regard this as a religious duty for which they
hope for the greatest reward from AUah. In fact, if the Muslim
ponders how misguided these people are, he will realise two things:
(a) He will realise the greatness of Allah's blessing, kindness and
generosity due to the fact that He has saved him from this
misguidance; this is something that requires gratitude to Allah.
(b) He will learn a lesson about the extent of these people's
deviation and misguidance that anyone with the slightest amount
of reason would realise, such as their seeking to draw close to
Allah by cursing Abu Bakr and 'Umar morning and evening,
and their claims that the one who curses them once will not have
any sin recorded for him during that day. All the rational people
of this Ummah, and indeed those of religions of divine origin,
would realise clearly, on the basis of what they know of the
religion of Allah (&), that Allah (&) never asked any nation to
draw close to Him by means of cursing any of the disbelievers,

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

507

even if they were the worst of disbelievers. Moreover, He does
not ask them to draw close to Him by cursing Iblees, the
accursed who was cast out from His mercy, morning and
evening, in a specific wording to draw close to Allah as the
RZifidi Shia seek to draw close to Him by cursing Abu Bakr and
'Umar.
Rather, 1"' do not know, after reading and examining the books
of the RZdis themselves, that they contain any supplication,
specific or otherwise, which curses Abu Jahl, Umayyah ihn
Khalaf or al-Waleed ibn al-Mugheerah, who were the worst
disbelievers among the people and the most vehement in their
rejection of the Messenger of Allah (@), or even any curses
directed against Iblees, while at the same time their books are
filled with reports cursing Abu Bakr and 'Umar, as in the
'supplication of the two idols of Quraysh' and others. This is a
clear sign to any rational person of the extent of misguidance a
person can reach if he turns away from the path of Allah (g)
and follows whims and desires and innovations. His evil deeds
will be made attractive to him until he no longer recognises what
is good and what is bad .and cannot distinguish between truth and
falsehood; instead he sinks in darkness and lives intoxicated by
the impact of whims and desires. This is what Allah (%) told us
in His Book when He described these type of people, saying: $Is
he, then, to whom the evil of his deeds is made fair-seeming, so
that he considers it as good [equal to one who is rightly guidcd]?
Verily, AUah sends astray whom He wills, and guides whom He
wills.# (Qur2an35: 8 )
(Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they
thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds.) (Qur'an
18: 104)

(Say [O Muhammad] whoever is in error, the Most Gracious

508

[Allah] will extend [the rope] to him, until, when they see that
which they were promised, either the torment or the Hour, they
will come to know who is worst in position, and who is weaker
in forces.) (Qur'an 19: 75)

to prove the alleged apostasy of the Companions,

(You did indeed wish for death [Ash-Shahidah - martyrdom]
before you met it. Now you have seen it openly with your own eyes.
Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed [many]
Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will
you then turn back on your heels [as disbelievers]? And he who turns
hack on his heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; and Allah
will give reward to those who are grateful.) (Qur'an 3: 143-144)
The R Z d i Shia quote this passage from Allah's noble Book,
claiming that it clearly refers to the Companions' turning back on
their heels after the death of the Messenger of Allah (B);
they say
that this includes the vast majority of the Companions and that very
few of them remained steadfast. The small group whom the Rififidi
Shia believe remained steadfast are 'those who are grateful', and they
cannot be more than a few because Allah (&) says: dBut few of My
slaves are gatefulk (Qur'an 34: 13). Their conclusion is that these
verses, which speak of the Companions who turned on their heels,
clearly refer to the Companions who lived with the Messenger of
Allah (g)
in Madinah and also refer to the Companions turning on
their hells straight after the death of the Prophet (gJ,
without any
time elapsing.882 They twisted the meaning of these verses and

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

applied them to what happened with bay'at as-Saqeefah, when the
noble Companions elected Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (&) as caliph. The
response to these serious lies is as follows:
At-Tabari narrated in his hadith, with his chain of narration
from ad-D*%,
that the latter said concerning the verse
(~uhamrnadis no more than a Messenger, and indeed [many]
Messengers have passed away before him) (Qur'an 3: 144): "People
whose faith was shaky and the hypocrites said, on the day when the
people fled and deserted the Prophet of Allah (g)
(at Uhud), when he
was wounded above his eyebrow and his tooth was broken:
'Muhammad has been killed; go hack to your former religion.' That
is why Allah
says: (If he dies or is killed, will you then tum back
on your heels [as dishelievers]?fi (Qur'an 3: I # ) . " ~ ~ ~

(s)

It is also narrated that Ibn Jurayj said: "People with doubts,
shaky faith and hypocrisy in their hearts said, when the people fled
and deserted the Prophet (g):
'Muhammad has been killed; go back
to your former religion.' Then this verse was revealed."884What is
meant by 'turning back on (one's) heels' in this verse is what the
hypocrites said when the rumour spread among the people that the
Messenger of Allah (g)
had been killed; they said: "Go back to your
former religion."
This verse is not speaking about those who apostatised after
the death of the Prophet (g),
even though it is proof against them. If
it was about them, this would provide further proof that the
Companions of the Prophet (s)
had nothing to do with the apostates,
because they are the ones who fought them. Allah (&) caused His
religion to prevail at their hands, and He caused the apostates to be
defeated by means of the Companions' fighting them; some of them
came back to Islam, and some died in a state of apostasy, and the
vime of Abu Bakr was demonstrated by his fighting them.885
Because of this, 'Ali (&) used to say that the words of Allah (g),

510

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

$And Allah will give reward to those who are gratefulb (Qur'an 3:
144), referred to those who remained steadfast in their religion: Abu
Bakr and his companions.886He also used to say that Ahu Bakr was
foremost among those who were grateful and those who were
beloved by Allah
The battle of U?~udis a special case, hence the verses of Soorat
A1 'Imrh came within the context of the unique circumstances of this
battle. To use this verse to analyze events such as the oath of
allegiance in Saqeefah or the Battle of the Camel is very strange and
inconsistent, and it has nothing to do with academic methodology.
This verse is regarded as one of the
signs of the deep faith
and wisdom of Abu Bakr (&) and of his relentless efforts in
defending the religion of Allah (&). The best testimony to that is his
steadfast attitude on the day the Messenger of Allah (g)
died, the
day when he stood fum and addressed the people despite the grief
and weakness that he felt at the loss of the Messenger of Allah (g).
He said: "Allah (s)
says BVerily, you [0 Muhammad] will
die, and verily, they [too] will dieB (Qur'an 39: 30) and $Muhammad
is no more than a Messenger, and indeed [many] Messengers have
passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn
back on your heels [as disbelievers]? And he who turns hack on his
heels, not the least harm will he do to Allah; and Allah will give
reward to those who are gratefulk (Qur'an 3: 144). Whoever used to
worship Allah (&), verily Allah is Ever-Living and will never die;
whoever used to worship Muhammad, verily Muhammad has
died.""'
His strict stance against those who turned on their heels,
replacing faith with disbelief by following false prophets like
Mnsaylimah, Sajj*, Tulayhah ibn Khuwaylid, al-Aswad al-'Ansi
and their ilk, and those who said, 'We will not pray and we will not
pay zaka," and dismissed the obligations of Islam on the basis of

'Ali ihn Ahi Trilib

51 1

their whims and desires, is the most brilliant example of the greatness
of Abu Bakr and the Companions and their devotion to slam.^^^ 'Ali
(&) stood beside the Rightly Guided Caliph Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq
(&) in the jihad against the apostates and those who withheld zak2h.
As for at-Teejhi, Sharaf ad-Deen al-Musawi and other leading
scholars of the Twelver Shia, they are still waffling over the issue of
those who withheld zak2h. trying to justify their stance and accusing
Abu Bakr and the Companions of falsehood and apostasy. What
extreme misguidance these people are uttering when they impugn the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah and regard those who strove
for the sake of Allah in support of this religion as symbols of
disbelief, apostasy and hypocrisy.
It is not surprising to leam the extent of the respect that Imam
Ja'far ibn 'Ali ibn al-Husayn ibn 'Ali ibn Abi Taib had for Abu Bakr
as-Siddeeq. Al-Irbili narrated in Kashf a l - G h u m a h fi Ma'rifat alA'immah from 'Urwah ibn Abdullah that he said: "I asked Abu Ja'far
Muhammad ibn 'Ali about adorning swords, and he said: 'There is
nothing wrong with it; Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (&) adorned his
sword.' I said: 'Do you say "as-Siddeeq"?' He jumped up, turned to
face towards the qiblah and said: 'Yes, w-Siddeeq. Whoever does
not call him as-Siddeeq, may AUah never accept from him anything
he says in this world or in the hereafter as true.""90 May AUah have
mercy on Imam Abu Ja'far, and may Allah bless his words that were
kept away in the books of the past and never recognised by those
people today.891

3.6.1.b. The verse in Soorat al-Mgidah
Some of these fanatics who insist that the Companions became
apostates and turned on their heels quote as evidence the verse in
which AUah ( B )says: 4 0 you who believe! Whoever from among
you turns back from his religion [Islam], Allah will bring a people
whom He win love and they will love Him; humble towards the

512

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

believers, stem towards the disbelievers, fighting in the way of Allah,
and never afraid of the blame of the blamers. That is the Grace of
Allah which He bestows on whom He wills. And Allah is AUSufficient for His creatures' needs, ~ll-Knower.) (Qur'an 5: 54)
This verse, which is quoted as evidence by the Twelver Shiite
scholars to indicate that the Companions apostatised and turned on
their
is the best evidence of the greatness of the Companions
(may Allah be pleased with them) and their striving to defend Islam;
it is not evidence of their apostasy and turning on their heels. AtTabari narrated, with his chain of narration from 'Ali (&), that he
said concerning the verse dAllah will bring a people whom He will
love and they will love Him) (Qur'an 5: 54) that the people referred to
are Abu Bakr and his companions. It was narrated that al-Hasan alBasri said: "This, by Allah, refers to Abu Bakr and his companions."
It was narrated that ad-D&h% said: "It is Abu Bakr and his
companions, until he brought them back to Islam." This was also the
view of Qatidah, Ibn Jurayj and other leading scholars of Qur'an
interp~etation.~~~
This verse speaks of the qualities of the generation and the
people of great faith by means of whom victory will be attained; they
will attain honour and glory while the apostates will be humiliated,
and their plots will backfxe on them. This meaning is obvious to
everyone who reads authentic books of history and sees the greatness
of the Companions, foremost among whom is the Rightly Guided
Caliph Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq, in contrast to the humiliation and
failure of the leaders of apostasy, such as Musaylimah, al-'Ansi and
~ajj*.'~~
The qualities mentioned in this verse are applicable most of all
to Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (
&
j
) and his armies from among the
Companions who fought the apostates. Allah
praised them in
the best and most sublime way. He stated that He loves them and they

(s)

i

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

513

love Him, and that they are humble towards the believers but stem
towards the disbelievers, fighting in the way of Allah (G)and never
fearing the blame of the blamers. I have discussed these qualities in
my book al-lnshir6h wa Raf' ad-l?eeq j? Seerat Abi Bakr as~ i d d e e whoever

3.6.l.c. The verse in Soorat at-Tawbah
(0 you who believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are
asked to march forth in the Cause of Allah [i.e. Jihsd] you cling
heavily to the earth? Are you pleased with the life of this world rather
than the hereafter? But little is the enjoyment of the life of this world
as compared to the hereafter. If you march not forth, He will punish
you with a painful tonnent and will replace you by another people;
and you cannot harm Him at all, and Allah is Able to do all things.)
( ~ u r ' a n9: 38-39)

Some of the R2fidi Shiite scholars said: "This verse clearly
shows that the Companions were reluctant to engage in jihad and
were pleased with the life of this world despite their knowledge that
its enjoyment was little, to the extent that they deserved this rebuke
from Allah (g)
and His threat of a painful punishment for them and
their being replaced with other, sincere believers. This warning of
being replaced by others is repeated in many verses, which clearly
indicates that the Companions were reluctant to engage in jihad on
many occasions."
In the verse: &d if you tum away [from Islam and the
obedience to Allah], He will exchange you for some other people and
they will not be the likes of
(Qur'an 47: 38), according to the
author of Thumma Ahtadaytu: "It is well established and known that
the Companions divided after the death of the Prophet (g),
and that
they differed with one another and lit the fire of turmoil until the
matter reached the level of fighting and bloody war, which caused the

514

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

decline and backwardness of the Muslims and raised the hopes of
their enemies against them."896
The response to this R%@ Shiite view is as follows: There is
nothing in these two verses that undermines the Companions of the
Prophet (g);
in these verses, Allah (%) is urging the Companions to
engage in jihad. This was when the Prophet (g)
commanded his
Companions to go out on the campaign of Tabook to fight the
Byzantines, which involved a very long and hot journey and came at
a time of hardship and poverty for the Companions of the Prophet
(g).
Some of them felt that it was difficult, so these verses were
revealed to encourage them to go out on jihad for the sake of Allah
(&) and to warn them against being reluctant and slow to obey the
command. The Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be pleased
with them) responded to the command of their Lord.
At-Tabari said, in his commentary on the verse: 40 you who
believe! What is the matter with you, that when you are asked to
march forth in the Cause of Allah [i.e. Jih2dJ you cling heavily to the
earth?) (Qur'an 9: 38): "This verse contains encouragement from
Allah (g)
to those who believed in Him, the Companions of His
Messenger, to join the campaign against the Byzantines. That was
during the campaign of the Messenger of Allah (@J to ~ a b o o k . " ' ~ ~
Undoubtedly these two verses contain an element of rebuke from
Allah (g)
to some of those who felt it too burdensome to go out for
jihad, but that is definitely not applicable to the majority of the
Companions of the Prophet (g),
who responded to the call of Allah
and His Messenger by hastening to go out in jihad for the sake of
~ l l a h . ' ~ Ibn
'
Katheer said: "This is a rebuke to those who stayed
behind and did not go out with the Messenger of AUah (@) on the
campaign to ~ a b o o k . " ' ~ ~
It is well known that the only Companions who stayed behind
and failed to go out with the Prophet (g)
on the campaign to Tabook

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

515

were those who had legitimate excuses, except for three people, as is
indicated by the well-known hadith of Ka'b ibn M2ik that appears in
Bukhari and ~uslim?" Those three people were Ka'b ibn M%k,
Hi12 ibn Umayyah and Markah ibn ar-Rabee'. Yet it is proven in the
Book of Allah, to which falsehood cannot come from before it or
behind it,901that Allah (&) accepted the repentance of all of them,
and He revealed these verses concerning His forgiveness of all of the
Companions:
(Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhijiroon [Muslim emigrants
who left their homes and came to Madinah] and the An& who
followed him [Muhammad] in the time of distress [Tabook
expedition], after the hearts of a party of them had nearly deviated
[from the Right Path], but He accepted their repentance. Certainly,
He is unto them full of kindness, Most Merciful. And [He did forgive
also] the three who did not join the rrabook expedition and whose
case was deferred (by the Prophet) for Allah's Decision] till for them
the eaah, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were
straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from
AUah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He forgave them [accepted
their repentance], that they might beg for His Pardon [repent (unto
Him)]. Verily, AUah is the One Who forgives and accepts
(Qur'an 9: 117-118)
repentance, Most Merciful.)
In these verses, Allah (&) states that He accepted the
repentance of the Muhgjiroon and An& who followed the
Messenger (g)
during the campaign to Tabook, which was called the
campaign of hardship, and did not stay behind despite what befell
them of hardship, difficulty and poverty. Some reports describe how
a group of them would share one date between them: one would suck
on it and then drink some water, then another one would suck on it
and then drink some water, and so on until it came to the last of
them.902 The reports also state that Allah ( B ) accepted the

516

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shia

repentance of the three who had stayed behind and did not join the
Messenger of Allah (g)
during that campaign, after the Prophet (B)
shunned them and they regretted it deeply atill for them the earth, vast
as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them).
After that, there was no excuse for anyone to impugn the
Companions of the Prophet (g)
or csiticise them for anything they
niight do, after Allah ( B )forgave them, accepted their repentance,
a I praised them greatly in His Book; the Messenger (g)
also
p sed them in his ~ u n n a h . ~ ' ~
As for the Companions (&) fighting one another, that
happened during the reign of 'Ali (A),and we have already looked
at the causes of the differences among the Companions during the
turmoil, examined the point of view of each group and established
that they are innocent of all the accusations that were made against
them. Their actions were based on what they thought was correct on
the basis of their understanding the Qur'an and Sunnah, and no one
has the right to criticise them for any of their actions or opinions.904
We should refrain from delving too deeply into the disagreements
among them and pray for mercy for them; this is the best way. May
Allah be pleased with them

3.6.1.d. The hadith about people being
prevented from reaching the reservoir
said: "While I was standing at the
The Messenger of Allah (g)
reservoir, I saw a group of my followers that were brought close to
me, and I recognised them. A man (an angel) came out from between
me and them and said to them: 'Come along.' I said: 'Where to?' He
said: 'To hell.' I said: 'What is wrong with them?' He said: 'They
turned back on their heels.' And I did not see any of them escaping
except a few."906
He (g)
also said: "I will be ahead of you at the reservoir, and
whoever comes to me will drink, and whoever drinks will never be

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

51 7

thirsty again. Some people will come to me whom I recognise and
they recognise me, but a barrier will he placed between me and them.
I will say: 'My companions!' It will be said: 'Yon do not know what
they introduced after you were gone.' And I shall say: 'Away with
them, away with those who changed after I was gone."'907
Some of the Shia say: "The one who examines these numerous
hadiths, which the scholars of Ah1 asSnnnah narrate in their
collections of sound hadiths, will never have any doubt that most of
the Companions changed. They apostatised after the Prophet (B)
died, except for a few, and it is not possible under any circumstances
to interpret these hadiths as referring to the third group, namely the
hypocrites, because the text states: 'I will say, "My companions!"'
and because the hypocrites did not change after the death of the,
Prophet (@); otherwise the hypocrites would have become believers
after the death of the Prophet (3&)."908
The answer to this specious argument is as follows: There is no
dispute as to the good character of the Companions of the Prophet
(g),
and there is no doubt about their sincere faith and dignity after
Allah the All-Knowing confirmed their good character in His Book
and His Messenger praised them in his Sunnah. The praise of Allah
and His Messenger for them is the most eloquent of praise and
attributes to them the best qualities, as is well known in mutawiltir
reports from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger
(s).
We will discuss this below inshallah.
The Sunni commentators on hadith are agreed that the
Companions are not the ones who are meant in these hadiths, and
they do not imply any undermining of them. Ibn Qutaybah said,
refuting the R Z d i Shia in their use of this hadith as evidence for the
apostasy of the Companions: "How is it possible that Allah (%)
would be pleased with people and praise them and mention them as
an example in the Torah and Gospel, when He knew that they would

518

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

turn on their heels after the Messenger of Allah (@J died? If they say
that He did not know, this is an even worse type of di~belief."~"AlKhatGbi said: "None of the Companions apostatised; rather it was the
hard-hearted Arabs who apostatised, those who did not lend any
support to Islam. That does not undermine the status of the wellknown Companions. The word that appears in the original Arabic, a
diminutive form of 'my companions', is indicative of their small
An-Nawawi said, commenting on the words "Do you know
what they introduced after you were gone?" in some reports of this
hadith: "The scholars differed as to what is meant here; there are
several views:
(a) That what is meant is the hypocrites and apostates. It is
possible that they will be gathered with those who will
have bright faces and limbs (the believers), and the
Prophet (g)
will call them because of the sign he sees on
them, but it will be said: 'These are not the ones
concerning whom you were given the promise; these are
the ones who changed after you were gone' - in other
words, they did not die in a state of Islam as they appeared
to be.
(b) That what is meant is those who lived at the time of the
Prophet (g),
then apostatised after he was gone. The
Prophet (&) will call them because of what he knew
during his lifetime, which is that they were Muslims, and it
will be said: 'They apostatised after you were gone.'

(c) That what is meant is those who committed acts of
disobedience and major sins but who died believing in
tawheed, and followers of innovations that did not take
them beyond the pale of Islam. Based on this view, it is not

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

51 9

certain that those who ~ I Eprevented from reaching the
reservoir will end up in hell. It is possible that they will be
prevented from reaching the reservoir as a punishment,
then Allah (&) will have mercy on them and admit them
to paradise with no further
These or similar views were narrated by al-Qurfubi and Ihn
Hajar (may Allah have mercy on them).912
It is possible that those who are prevented from reaching the
reservoir will belong to all the groups mentioned above, since the
reports may be interpreted in all three ways. In some reports, the
Prophet
said: ''I will say 'My companions (in the diminutive
form)';" in other reports, he
said: "People will be taken before
they reach me, and I will say: '0 my Lord, they belong to me and my
Ummah;"' and in yet other reports he (ggJ said: "Some people will
come to me whom I recognise, and they will recognise me."913 The
apparent meaning is that the ones who are prevented are not one
group, and this is reasonable, because in Islam punishments are
according to sins, so one punishment may be applied to all those who
deserve it of those who committed that particular

(s)

(s)

a)

explained that the reason for
Even though the Prophet
being kept away from the reservoir is apostasy, as in the words 'they
apostatised,' or introducing innovations into Islam, as in the words,
"you do not know what they introduced after you were gone,"915
what this implies is that everyone who apostatised from Islam,
whether he was one of the Bedouin who apostatised after the death of
the Prophet (g)
or those who came after that, would be prevented
from reaching the reservoir, and included with them will be those
who introduced new things into the religion, namely the innovators.
This is the view of some scholars. Ihn 'Abdul-Barr (may Allah have
mercy on him) said: "Everyone who introduces innovation into the
religion will be among those who are kept away from the reservoir,

520

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

such as the Kharijites, R%@s and all followers of whims and desires.
The same applies to those evildoers who go to extremes in injustice
and denying people's rights, and those who commit major sins
openly. For all of these people, there is the fear that they may be
among those who are meant in this repori. And Allah (%) knows
best."916
Al-Qumbi (may Allah have mercy on him) said in atTadhkirah: "Our scholars (may Allah have mercy on them all) say
that everyone who apostatises from the religion of Allah, or
introduces into it something with which He is not pleased and which
He has not ordained,917 will he among those who are kept far away
from the reservoir, and those who are kept farthest away will be those
who went against the main body of the Muslims and split from their
way, such as the Kharijites and R%@s of various groups and the
Mutazilites of different types. All of these people changed their
re~igion."~'~
Once this is established, the innocence of all the Companions
of all that the Shia accused them of becomes apparent. Being
prevented from reaching the reservoir is because of apostasy and
introducing innovations into Islam, and the Companions are the most
unlikely of all people to have done anything of that nature; on the
contrary, they were the enemies of the apostates and fought them in
the most d i i c u l t and critical circumstances after the death of the
Prophet (g).
According to the report narrated by at-Tahari in his
hook of history, with his chain of narration from 'Urwah ibn azZuhayr from his father: "Arabs from every tribe apostatised, whether
it was the entire tribe or some individuals of the tribe. Hypocrisy
became apparent, the hopes of the Jews and Christians were raised,
and the Muslims were like sheep on a rainy winter night because of
the loss of their Prophet (B)and because of their small number and
the great number of their enemies."919

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

521

Despite all that, the Companions of the Prophet (B)
confronted these apostates, fought them strongly and stood up to
them until Allah (%&)
caused them to prevail over them. Some of
these apostates came back to Islam, and some were killed, and the
glory, strength and respect of Islam were restored at the hands of the
Companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Moreover, the
Companions were those who most strongly denounced the people of
innovation; this is why innovations did not become strong until after
their era came to an end. When some innovations began to appear
during their era, they condemned them and disavowed the
innovations and those who introduced them. It was narrated that Ibn
'Umar (&) said to the one who told him what the Qadaris were
saying: "K you meet these people, tell them that Ibn 'Umar has
nothing to do with them, and they have nothing to do with him" three times.920Al-Baghawi said, noting that there was consensus
among the Companions and all the early generations (the pious
predecessors) on opposing those who introduced innovations, that
this was the way of the Companions, Tibi'oon and their followers,
and the Sunni scholars; they were all agreed on opposing and
shunning the people of innovation?"
This noble attitude of the Companions (may Allah be pleased
with them) towards the apostates and those who introduced
innovation is among the greatest and clearest testimony of the
sincerity of their religious commitment, the strength of their faith, the
degree of their efforts for the sake of Islam and their struggle against
its enemies after the death of the Messenger of Allah
Allah (&)
supported the Snnnah through them and suppressed innovations, a
fact which highlights the lies of the Rifi&s who accused them of
apostasy and introducing innovations into the religion and suggested
that that they will be kept away from the reservoir of the Prophet (@).
In reality, the Companions will be the most deserving of all people to
come to the reservoir of their Prophet (@) because of their good

(s).

522

'Ali's attihrde towards the Kharijites and Shia

companionship towards him during his lifetime and their continued
support of Islam after his death.
This does not contradict the words of the Prophet (&): "Some
of those who accompanied me will come to me at the reservoir, and
when I see them and they come close to me, they will be taken away
before they reach me."922These are people who were Muslim at the
time of the Prophet (g);
many of the Arab tribes apostatised after the
death of the Prophet (g),
but as far he (g)
knew, they accompanied
him, because when he died they were still following his religion.
Hence it will he said to him: "You do not know what they introduced
after you were gone." According to other reports, it will be said:
"You have no knowledge of what they introduced after you were
gone; they apostatised and turned on their heels."923
It seems that this applies to those who apostatised after the
death of the Prophet (g).
What do the Companions of the Prophet
(B)- who supported Islam in the best manner after their Prophet
was gone, fought the apostates, strove in jihad against the
disbelievers and hypocrites, then conquered many lands until the
religion of AUah spread to many regions - have to do with these
traitors? According to Ah1 as-Sunnah, these apostates are not
considered Companions at all because a Companion, as defined by
the scholars, is one who met the Prophet (SJ,believing in him, and
died as a ~ u s l i r n . ~ ~ ~
With regard to the words of the Prophet (g),
"I do not think
any of them will be saved from it (hell) except a few,"92Sand the
R Z d i Shia's quoting them as evidence for regarding all of the
Companions as disbelievers except for a few of them, the evidence is
in fact against them, because the pronoun in the Arabic word for 'of
them' refers to those people who will approach the reservoir then be
turned away from it, meaning that only a few from them will he
saved. This is clear from the context of the hadith because it says:

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

523

"While I was standing at the reservoir, I saw a group of my followers
that were brought close to me, and I recognised them. A man (an
angel) came out from between me and them and said to them: 'Come
along.' I said: 'Where to? He said: 'To hell.' I said: 'What is wrong
with them?' He said: 'They turned back on their heels.' And I did not
see any of them escaping except a few."926
There is no mention of the Companions in this hadith; it
simply mentions a group of people who will he prevented from
reaching the reservoir, and none of them wiil reach it except a few.927
Ibn Hajar said, commenting on the words, "I did not see any of them
escaping except a few" in this hadith: "This refers to those who will
approach the reservoir and almost reach it, then will be turned away,
which means that none of them will reach it except a few. Thus it
becomes clear that the Shia's argument on the basis of this hadith is
flawed, and the Companions are innocent of what they are accused
of,n928

3.6.2. The dignity and good character
of the Companions (&)
The definition of good character boils down to one idea, which
is a quality in a person that makes him pious and dignified. This can
only be attained by doing what is enjoined, refraining from what is
forbidden and keeping away from anything that undermines dignity.
To achieve this, a person must he Muslim, adult, of sound mind and
free of evildoing. This standard was never reached by anyone as it
was reached by the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g).
All
of them (may Allah be pleased with them) met the description of
dignity and good character.929
What this means in the context of their narration of hadiths
from the Messenger of Allah (g)
is that they refrained from telling
deliberate lies or distorting what was narrated. Al-'Allbah ad-

5Z4

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Dahlawi said: "We have examined the biographies of all tbe
Companions, and we found that they all believed that telling a lie
about the Prophet (g)
was the worst of sins. They refrained from it,
taking all precautions to avoid it, as is clear to anyone who studies
their biographies."930
There is abundant evidence in the Book of Allah (;&) and the
Sonnah of His Messenger (g)
of the good character of the noble
Companions (may Allah be pleased with them), and there is no room
for any doubts about their dignity and good character. Every hadith
with an intact chain of narration extending from the one who narrated
it to the Prophet (&) cannot be binding unless the good character of
the narrators is proven. All the narrators must be examined, with the
exception of the Companion who narrated it from the Prophet (@),
because the sound character of the Companions is well established.
Allah (%) confirmed their good character and told us about their
purity and the fact that He chose them, as is clearly stated in the noble
Qur'an, about which Allah says: (Falsehood cannot come to it from
before it or behind it.) (Qur'an 41: 42)931
(a) Allah ( B )says: %ThusWe have made you [hue Muslims -real
believers of Islamic Monotheism, true followers of Prophet
Muhammad and his Sunnah (legal ways)], a just [and the best]
nation, that you be witnesses over mankind and the Messenger
[Muhammad] be a witness over you.# (Qur'an 2: 143)
This verse proves the good character and dignity of the Companions
(&). The word that is trauslated here as 'just' and 'best' refers to
people of dignity and good character, because they are the ones who
are addressed directly in this verse.932
(b) Allah (&) says: %You[true believers in Islamic Monotheism, and
real followers of Prophet Muhammad and his Sunnah] are the best of
peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma'roof [i.e.
Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam has ordained] and forbid Al-

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

525

Munkar [polytheism, disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden], and
you believe in Allah.) (Qur'an 3: 110)

The evidence in this verse for the good character of the Companions
(&) is that they established the fact that this Ummah is better than
all nations that came before it, and those who most deserve to be
included in this description are those who were addressed directly
where and when these words were revealed, namely the noble
Companions (&). This implies that they are people of good
character and dignity in all situations; in all their affairs, they adhere
to the teachings of Islam and do not go against them. It is very
unlikely that Allah ($g) would describe them as the best nation if
they were not people of good character and righteousness. Is there
anyone but them who could be described as the best?933
(c) Allah (&) says: d ~ n dthe forenlost to embrace Islam of the
Muhiijiroon and the An& and also those who followed them exactly
[in faith]. Allah is well-pleased with them as they are well-pleased
with H i . He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow
[paradise], to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.B
(Qur'an 9: 100)

The evidence in this verse for their good character is that AUah (&)
states that He is pleased with them. AUah
does not affirm that He
is pleased with anyone except those who deserve it, and no one
deserves it except one who is upright and of good character in all his
affairs and religious commitment. How could one whom Allah ($)
praises in this manner not be of good character? When sound
character can be established by the testimony of two people, how can
the good character of the best of people not he confirmed by this
praise when it comes from the Lord of the Worlds?934

(s)

(d) Allah (&) says: (Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And
those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful
among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate

526

'Ali's attitude towards the Khurijites and Shia

[in prayer], seeking Bounty from Allah and [His] Good Pleasure. The
mark of them [i.e. of their Faith] is on their faces [foreheads]from the
traces of prostration [during prayers]. This is their description in the
Taw& [Torah]. But their description in the lnjeel [Gospel] is like a
[sown] seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and
becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the
sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has
promised those among them who believe [i.e. all those who follow
Islamic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad till the Day
of Resurrection] and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a
mighty reward [i.e. paradise].b (Qur'an 48: 29)
This description that Allah (%) gives them in His Book and this
praise that He bestows upon them leaves no room for any doubt about
the sound character of the Companions. Al-Qnaubi said,
commenting on this verse: "All of the Companions are of good
character, close friends and chosen ones of Allah (&) and the best of
His creation after His Prophets and Messengers. A small group of
insignificant people were of the view that the Companions were like
other people, so it was essential to research them in order to establish
their dignity and good character. Some of these people differentiated
between the Companions' situation at the beginning of Islam and
later on, saying: 'They were all of good character at that time (at the
beginning), then they changed later on, and there appeared among
them war and bloodshed; so it is essential to research and examine.'
This idea is to be rejected, because the best and most virtuous of the
Companions, such as 'Ali, Talhh, az-Zubayr and others (may Allah
be pleased with them), are among those whom Allah praised and was
pleased with, and they were pleased with Him. He promised them
paradise in the words: 4Allah has promised those among them who
believe [i.e. all those who follow Islamic Monotheism, the religion of
Prophet Muhammad till the Day of Resurrection] and do righteous
good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward 1i.e. paradiselk (Qur'nn

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

527

48: 29j, especially the ten who will definitely enter paradise
according to the statements of the Messenger (g).
Even though these
Companions had prior knowledge of a great deal of turmoil and
events that would take place among them after the death of their
Prophet, because he told them about it, that does not affect their status
and virtue because their involvement in these events was based on
their own ijtihiid and what they thought was right."935
(e) AUah (s)
says: g[And there is also a share in this booty] for the
poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and their
property, seeking Bounties from Allah and to please Him, and
helping Allah [i.e. helping His religion] and His Messenger
[Muhammad]. Such are indeed the truthful [to what they say]; And
those who, before them, had homes [in Madinah] and had adopted
the Faith, love those who emigrate to them, and have no jealousy in
their breasts for that which they have been given [from the booty of
Banu an-Nadeerl, and give them [emigrants] preference over
themselves, even though they were in need of that. And whosoever is
saved from his own covetousness, such are they who will be the
successful.B (Qur'an 59: 8.9)
The tmthful are the Muhzjiroon, and the successful are the An$&.
This is how Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq interpreted these two words from
these verses, as he said in his speech on the day of hay'at asSaqeefah, addressing the A n s k "Allah has called us the truthful, and
He has called you the successful, and He has enjoined you to be
where we are, as He says: 4 0 you who believe! Fear Allah, and be
with those who are true [in words and deeds].) (Qur2an 9: 119)
These praiseworthy attributes that are mentioned in these two verses
were all achieved by the Muhijireen and An$& among the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g).
They had these
chxacteristics, hence the Muhijireen were described as the truthful,
and those who supported and helped them, giving them precedence

528

'Ali's attitude towards the Khurijites and Shia

over themselves, were described as the successful. These verses
clearly point to the good character of the Companions, so their good
character is established and proven on the basis of the text of the
noble ~ n r ' a n . ' ~ ~
With regard to evidence from the Sunnah for the good
character of the Companions, there are numerous hadiths in which
the Prophet (g)
praised them for their good character. For example:
(a) It was narrated by Bukhari and Muslim in sound hadiths from
Abu Bakr (&) that the Prophet
said: "Let the one who is
present convey to the one who is absent."937 The evidence for their
good character in this hadith is that these words were uttered by the
Prophet (g)
to the greatest gathering of the Companions during the
Farewell Pilgrimage. This is one of the greatest affirmations of their
good character because he asked them, without exception, to convey
what they heard from him to those who were not present at that
gathering.938 Concerning the words "Let the one who is present
convey to the one who is absent," Ibn H i b b h said: "This is the
greatest evidence that the Companions were all of good character,
and there is no one among them who is of questionable character or is
to he regarded as a weak narrator, because if there had been anyone
among them who was not of good character, the Prophet (#$Jwould
have excluded him and said, 'Let so-and-so convey to those who are
absent.' The fact that he included all of them iu this injunction to
convey to those who came after them proves that they were all of
good character, and that is sufficient honour for those whom the
Messenger of Allah (gg)
regarded as such."939

(s)

(b) Bukhari narrated, with his chain of narration going back to Abu
Sa'eed al-Khudri (may Allah he pleased with him), that the latter
said: "The Prophet (&) said: 'Do not revile my Companions, for if
you were to give the equivalent of Uhud in gold, it would not amount
to a mudd (about what one's two hands can scoop up) of one of them,

i

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

529

or half of that."'940 The evidence for the good character of the
Companions in this hadith is that describing them as not being of
good character is disparaging them, especially since he
forbade
some of those who met him and accompanied him to hurt those who
were senior to them because of their efforts in supporting Islam. This
applies even more to those who come after the Companions with
regard to all the
We know that all the Companions
are of good character because Allah has described them as such and
praised them, and the Messenger of AUah (g)
also praised them.
There is no need for confirmation of their good character by anyone
e1se.9~'

(a)

Even if their good character was not mentioned in the Book of Allah
or the Sunnah of His Messenger (g),
-- people of sound mind and good
hearts would confirm their good character on the basis of the
mutawgtir reports from them that tell of their great deeds and efforts
to support the religion of Allah (B).
They did whatever they could to
support the truth, raise its banner, lay its foundations and propagate
its rulings throughout the land (may Allah be pleased with them all).
What is meant by good character here is not avoidance of falling into
sin, because that is only for one who is
Ibn al-Anb2ri
said: "Saying that they were of good character does not mean
affirming that they were infallible or that it was impossible for them
to sin; rather what is meant is that their reports may be accepted
without needing to establish or prove their being of good character,
unless there is proof of something to undermine their good character
or dignity, but nothing of the sort was ever proven, praise be to Allah
So we shall continue to believe that they remained as they were
at the time of the Messenger of Allah (@), unless the opposite is
proven."944

(s).

Consensus on their good character: Ah1 as-Sunnah wdJam2'ah are unanimously agreed that all the Companions were of

530

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

good character without exception, whether they were involved in
turmoil (fitnah) or not; Ah1 as-Sunnah do not differentiate between
them. All of them are of good character, and we think positively of
them because of the honour that Allah bestowed upon them of
accompanying His Prophet (g),
their great efforts in supporting the
Messenger (g)
- , by migrating to join him and striving alongside him
in jihad, and their adhering to the commands of Islam and heeding its
limits. Therefore their testimony and reports are accepted without
needing to establish their good character, according to the consensus
of those whose view is credible. Consensus on their good character
was narrated by a great number of scholars; here are some examples:
(a) Al-Khateeb al-Baghdadi (may Allah have mercy on him) said,
after mentioning evidence from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of
His Messenger that points to the good character of all the
Companions: "This is the view of all the scholars and those jurists
whose views are credible.""'
(b) Abu 'Umar ibn 'Abdul-Barr (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
"Even though we need not examine the character of the Companions,
because all the followers of truth among the Muslims - Ahl asSunnah wal-Jam2'ah - are agreed that they are of good character,
we still have to find out about their names and who they are."946
(c) Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni (may Allah have mercy on him)
narrated that there was consensus on their good character, and he
explained the reason for that consensus as follows: "Perhaps the
reason for it is that they are the ones who transmitted Islam (to the
next generation), and if we had to he sceptical about their reports,
then Islam would have been limited to the time of the Messenger (g)
and would not have continued to other eras."947
(d) Tbu as-Sal* stated that the consensus on the good character of the
Companions was a unique quality that distinguished them from

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

531

others. He said: "All of the Companions have a special quality, which
is that the good character of any one of them is not to be questioned;
it is to be taken for granted because they were all of good character
according to the texts of the Qur'an and Sunnah and the consensus of
those whose views are credible." He also said: "The Ummah is
unanimously agreed on the good character of all the Companions,
including those who got involved in fimah. This is the consensus of
the scholars whose view is credible; they think positively of them
because they are the ones who transmitted Islam and har ria."^^' And
Allah
knows best.

(s)

(e) Imam an-Nawawi (may Allah have mercy on him) said, after
mentioning that the wars that occurred among them and the stances
they adopted were based on what they thought was right, and that all
of them are excused for what happened among them: "Hence the
people of the straight path and those who are credible agreed that
their testimony and reports are to be accepted and that they are of
good character, may AUah be pleased with them."949 He said in atTaqreeb: "All the Companions are of good character and credible,
including those who were involved in the fitnah and those who were
not, according to the consensus of those whose views are
credible."950
(f) Al-H%fi& Ibn Katheer said: "All of the Companions are of good
character according to Ah1 as-Sunnah walJami'ah, because of the
praise bestowed upon them by Allah in His holy Book and because of
what the Sunnah says in praise of them in all their attitudes, deeds,
sacrifice of wealth and lives, striving alongside the Messenger of
Allah (g)
and seeking great reward with Allah (3g)."951

(g) Al-'Iraqi said, commenting on al-AIfiyyah, after quoting some
Qur'anic verses and hadiths which prove the good character of the
Companions: "The entire Ummah is agreed on the credibility and
good character of those who did not get involved in turmoil. With

532

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

regard to those who did get involved in the turmoil at the time of
'UthtnZ- those scholars whose views are credible are also
unanimously agreed on their good character, thinking positively of
them and assuming that it was based on what they thought was
right."952
(h)Al-H2fi& Ibn Hajar stated that Ah1 as-Sunnah are unanimously
agreed on the good character of the Companions. He said: "Ah1 asSunnah are agreed that all of them were of good character, and no one
disagreed concerning that except weird or odd innovators."953

All of these blessed reports, which state that here was
consensus among the leading scholars, are a clear indication and
definitive proof that the good character of the Companions is
something finnly established that may be taken for granted and
regarded as a given. This leaves no room for anyone to doubt it, after
the confirmation of their good character by Allah (&) and His
Messenger (@) and the consensus of the Ummah on that.954

3.6.3. Obligation to love them, pray for them
and ask for forgiveness for them
The belief of Ah1 as-Sunuah wal-Jami'ah is that it is
obligatory to love the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
and to respect and honour them, regard their consensus on an issue as
binding and follow their example. It is forbidden to bear grudges
against any one of them, because of the honour that Allah (&)
bestowed upon them of accompanying His Messenger (g),
engaging
in jihad alongside him to support the religion of Islam, bearing
patiently the persecution of the polytheists and hypocrites, migrating
from their homes and leaving behind their wealth, and giving
precedence to love of Allah and His Messenger (g)
over all of that.
Allah (&) says: #And those who came after them say: 'Our
Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

533

put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our
Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful'b (Qur'an 59:
lo). This verse indicates that it is obligatory to love the Companions,
because Allah
has given a share of the fay' to those who come
after the Companions, as long as they persist in loving them,
supporting them and praying for forgiveness for them; it indicates that
the one who insults any of them or believes anything bad about them
bas no right to the fay'. That was narrated from Imam Mil& and
others. M2ik said: "Whoever shows hatred towards any one of the
Companions of Muhammad (g)
. or bears any resentment towards
them in his heart has no right to the fay' of the Muslims." Then he
recited the verse: (And those who came after.), (Qnr'an 59: 10)

(s)

a

In both earlier and later times, Ah1 as-Sunnah wal-Jami'ah
understood that what was meant in the verse quoted above is a
command to the later generations to offer supplication and ask for
forgiveness for the earlier generation, namely the Companions of the
Messenger of AUah (g).
Muslim narrated, with his chain of
narration from H i s h h ibn 'Urwah, that his father said: '"kishah
said to me: '0 son of my sister, they were instructed to pray for
forgiveness for the Companions of the Prophet (@), but they reviled
them
Ibn BaEah and others narrated that Abu Badr said: "Ahdullah
ibn Zayd narrated from Talhah ibn Mutarraf from Muscab ibn Sa'd
ibn Abi Waqqa?, who said: 'People are of three categories, two of
which have passed and one of which remains, so the best you can do
is to be among the category that remains.' Then he recited: (And [it is
also for] those who, before them, bad homes [in Madinah] and had
adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to them, and have no
jealousy in their breasts for that which they have been given [from the
booty of Bann an-Nadeer], and give them [emigrants] preference
over themselves even though they were in need of that. And

534

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

whosoever is saved from his own covetousness, such are they who
will be the successfuli) (Qur'an 59: 9). He said: 'These are the
Muhgjiroon, and they are a category that has passed.'
"Then he recited: 4And [it is also for] those who, before them,
had homes [in Madinah] and had adopted the Faith, love those who
emigrate to them, and have no jealousy in their breasts for that which
they have been given [from the booty of Banu an-Nadeerl, and give
them [emigrants] preference over themselves even though they were
in need of that. And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness,
such are they who will be the successful.# (Qur'an 59: 9) He said:
'These are the An$&, and they are the second category that has
passed.'
"Then he recited: (And those who came after them say: "Our
Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in faith, and
put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our
Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful"# (Qur'an 59:
10).Two have passed, and this group remains: those who pray for
forgiveness for them."956
No one with the slightest knowledge would doubt that the
RZ& Shia are excluded from this category since they do not pray for
mercy for the Companions or ask for forgiveness for them. Instead
they disparage them and bear grudges against them, so they are
deprived of this category and status, which the Muslim is required to
attain and should never go beyond, under any circumstances,until he
meets his ~ o r d . ~ ~ '
Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 'These
verses include praise for the Muhijireen and the An$& and for those
who come after them who pray for forgiveness for them and ask
Allah (g)not to put in their hearts any resentment towards them.
This indicates that these groups are the ones who are entitled to the
fay', and there is no doubt that these Rgfidis are excluded from these

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

535

three categories because they do not pray for forgiveness for those
who came before, and their hearts harbour resentment against them.
In these verses, there is praise for the Companions and for Ah1 asSunnah who love and support them, and exclusion for the RZdis
from that. This proves that the RZfidi madh-hab is flawed."958

3.6.4. Prohibition in the Qur'an and Sunnah
from reviling the Companions
(may Allah be pleased with them)

(Verily, those who annoy Allah and His Messenger (@, Allah has
cursed them in this world and in the hereafter, and has prepared for
them a humiliating torment.)
(Qur'an 33: 57)
This verse is a warning, a threat of being cast away from the
mercy of Allah (&g) and a humiliating torment, for the one who
offends Allah (&) by going against His commands, doing what He
forbids and persisting in that, and annoying and offending His
This includes both verbal and physical offences, such
as reviling, insulting or undermining him or his religion, or anything
else that may cause offence to him?" Among the things that cause
offence to him
is insulting his Companions; he has told us that
offending them is offending him, and that the one who offends him
has offended Allah (&)?61 What offence to the Companions could
be worse than reviling them? This verse contains the strongest and
clearest evidence that it is h a r h to revile them (may Allah be pleased
with them).

(s)

(And those who annoy believing men and women undeservedly,
they bear [on themselves] the crime of slander and plain sin.)
(Qur'an 33: 58)

536

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

This verse includes a waming against offending the believing
men and women by attributing things to them that they have nothing
to do with and have never done. It is the greatest lie to tell or narrate
about the believing men and women things that they did not do, for
the purpose of undermining and condemning them.962The reason
this verse proves that it is h a r k to insult the Companions is that they
are the foremost among the believers, and they were the ones who
were addressed in every verse that begins with the words, -40you
who believe!B (Qur'an 2: 104) or #Verily, those who believe [in the
Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism] and do righteous deeds)
(Qur'an 18: 107), throughout the Qur'an. This verse is indicative of
the prohibition on reviling the Companions because the word
'believers' was first applied to them, and they were the foremost
among the believers. Insulting them and undermining them are
among the greatest offences. Whoever undermines them in that way
has condemned the best of the believers for something that they did
not do. If a person regards disparaging and undermining them as part
of his religious practice, the waming mentioned in this verse applies
to
Ibn Katheer said, commenting on this verse: "Foremost among
those who are included in this waming are those who disbelieve in
Allah (&) and His Messenger, then the Riifidis who undermined the
Companions, criticised them for things of which Allah ( B )has
declared them innocent, and described them in terms contrary to what
Allah (&) has said about them. Allah (&) said that He is pleased
with the Muhiijireen and An&, and He praised them. Those ignorant
and stupid people disparage them and undermine them; they attribute
to them characteristics that they never had and deeds that they never
did. In fact, they (the RiifiGs) have a distorted view of things; they
criticise those who are praised and praise those who are
condemned."964

I

Xli ibn Abi Trilib

537

4Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those who are with him
are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You
see them bowing and falling down prostrate [in prayer], seeking
Bounty from Allah and [His] Good Pleasure. The mark of them [i.e.
of their Faith] is on their faces [foreheads] from the traces of
prostration [during prayers]. This is their description in the Tawr2t
rrorah]. But their description in the Injeel [Gospel] is like a [sown]
seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes
thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He
may enrage the disbelievers with them. AUah has promised those
among them who believe [i.e. all those who follow Islamic
Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad till the Day of
Resurrection] and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty
reward [i.e. paradise].)r
(Qur'an 48: 29)
The way in which this verse proves that it is h a r k to revile the
Companions (&) is that no one reviles them except one who is
enraged in his heart against them. In this verse, Allah ( B )explains
that it is the disbelievers who were enraged because of them, so this
indicates that it is har2m to condemn them or criticise them for what
happened among them in such a way as to put them down.

3.6.4.d.
It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (4)
said: "The
Messenger of AUah (@) said: 'Do not revile my companions. By the
One in Whose hand is my soul, if one of you were to spend the
equivalent of U ~ u in
d gold, it would not amount to a mudd of one of
them, or half of that."'965
This hadith clearly states that it is h a r k to insult the
Companions (&); it includes both a prohibition and a warning.966
There are many similar hadiths as well.

Prohibition of the early generation
from reviling the Companions
There are numerous texts narrated from the early generations
of the Ummah, its leading scholars among the Companions, and
those who came after them who followed them in truth, which defend
the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and state that it is
h a r h to revile them. They include the following:
(a) m a d ibn Hanbd said: "If you see a man mentioning one of the
in a bad way, then
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
doubt his slam."^^'
(b) Abu Zar'ah ar-R&i (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "If you
see a man undermining any of the Companions of the Messenger
of Allah (&), then know that he is a heretic, because the
Messenger (gg)in our view is true, and the Qur'an is true; the
people who conveyed this Qur'an and Sunnah were the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah
They seek to
undermine our witnesses (meaning those who conveyed the
Qur'an and Sunnah) so as to invalidate the Qur'an and Sunnah; it
is more appropriate to criticise and doubt them (those who
impugn the Companions), and they are heretics."968

(a).

(c) Imam ashShawk2ni (may Allah have mercy on him) narrated
that there was consensus among Ah1 d-Bayt that it is h a r k to
revile the Companions (may Allah be pleased with them ail), and
this was narrated in twelve reports.969 Abu Abdullah
Muhammad ibn 'Abdul-W%id d-Maqdisi narrated, with his
chain of narration going back to Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn alHusayn ibn 'Ali, that he said to Jihir al-Ja'fi: "0 Jzbir, I heard
that some people in Iraq are claiming that they love us, and they
impugn Abu Bakr and 'Umar and claim that I am telling them to
do so. Tell them from me that I disavow them before Allah (&).
By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, if I were to

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

539

be appointed to a position of authority, I would seek to draw
close to Allah ( B )by executing them. May I never attain the
intercession of Muhammad (gJif I do not seek forgiveness for
them (Abu Bakr and 'Umar) and pray for mercy for them. The
enemies of Allah (@) are not aware of their virtue. So tell them
that I disavow them and anyone else who shuns Abu Bakr and
'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them)."970
He also narrated, with his chain of narration going back to
Abdullah ibn al-Hasan ibn 'Ali, that he said: "I do not think that
any man who reviles Abu Bakr and 'Umar will ever be guided to
repent."971

3.6.5. Love of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
and his sons for the Companions (&)
The true picture will remain, bright and clear, and all else will
fade away. This picture is clarified in the most important book of the
Twelver Shia, namely Nahj al-Balighah. These texts are sufficient to
undermine their beliefs, which are based on cursing and reviling the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah (B)and saying that they
apostatised and turned on their heels after the Prophet (g)
died. Amir
al-Mu'mineen 'Ali himself described the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah (g)
as he saw them. He said: "I saw the
Companions of Muhammad, and I have never seen anyone like them.
They would wake up unkempt and dusty, having spent all night in
prostration and prayer, alternating between resting their foreheads
and their feet on the ground, feeling alarm due to thinking of the
hereafter. It was as if there were marks between their eyes like the
h e e s of a goat because of lengthy prostration. When Allah was
remembered, their eyes would fill with tears until their garments
became wet. They would sway like trees on a stormy day for fear of
punishment and in hope of reward."972

540

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharjjites and Shia

'Ali (&) felt sad for having parted from them, and he
enlogised them after their death like one who loves someone and
parts from the one whom he loves. He said: "Where are the people
who were called to Islam and accepted it, who read the Qur'an and
applied it, who unsheathed their swords and marched in ranks to all
comers of the ea*th with sore eyes because of weeping and empty
stomachs because of fasting, with dry lips because of supplication
and wan faces because of staying up at night, on whose faces was the
mark of the humble? Those are my brothers who have passed away,
so we have the right to yearn for them and to bite our fingers in
sorrow at their loss."973 0 YOU who love Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&>),
think about how he regarded the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah (g)!

Imam 'Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'hideen (may Allah have
mercy on him) used to mention the Companions of the Messenger of
Allah (&) and pray for mercy and forgiveness for them in his prayer
because of the support they gave to the master of mankind in
spreading the call of tawheed and conveying the message of Allah
(&)to His creation. He said: "0 Allah, grant them Your pleasure and
forgiveness, 0 Allah, in particular the Companions, who were good
companions and strove hard to support him; they stood with him and
hastened to offer refuge and protect him. They were the fmt to accept
his call and respond to him when he presented the proof for his
message. They left their wives and children to support his word; they
fought their fathers and sons in support of his prophethood; they
abandoned their tribes to join him, and their relatives abandoned
them when they decided to be with him. 0 Allah, whatever they gave
up was for Your sake, so be pleased with them and reward them
abundantly, since they strove hard to support the trnth for Your sake.
"Reward them for abandoning their homes for Your sake, for
leaving a life of ease for a life of hardship, and for leaving a life of

Xli ibn Abi Trilib

541

abundance to a life of little, all in support of Your religion. 0 Allah,
reward with the best reward those who followed them in trnth and
said, '0 our Lord, forgive our brothers in faith who came before us,'
those who followed their example and emulated them; they never had
any doubt about their deep insight and never hesitated to follow in
their footsteps and follow their guidance, loving and supporting
them, following their way, uniting behind them and never
questioning them with regard to what they passed on to them."974
This is the attitude of the Imams of Ah1 al-Bayt (may AUah be
pleased with them) towards the Companions. It is the opposite of
what is claimed by those Riififidiplotters and conspirators who hied to
conceal themselves under the cover of support for Ahl al-Bayt and
Shiism, but who were enemies of the noble Qur'an, the Sunnah and
the pure Imams of Ah1 al-Bayt.

3.7. Attitude of the Shia towards the Sunnah
The meaning of the word 'Sunnah' in Islamic terminology is
that which was narrated from the Prophet (B)of words, deeds or
approval?75 The scholars of Ah1 as-Sunnah paid a great deal of
attention to writing down the sound reports and made every effort to
protect the Sunnah from fabrications and fabricators. They did their
utmost and used the best academic methods of checking and
examining texts, to the extent that we can be certain that our scholars
(may Allah have mercy on them) were the first ones among all the
nations of the earth to lay down rnles of precise academic
examination of reports. Their effort in that fieId is something for
Muslims to be proud of and to boast about before all nations. This is
the bounty of Allah, which He grants to whom He wills, and Allah is
AU-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, ~ l l - ~ n o w i n ~ ? ~ ~
The Sunni scholars took the following steps to examine and
check reports. They were able to save and protect the Sunnah from

542

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

the plots and conspiracies that were drawn up against it, and to
cleanse it from all the dirt that contaminated it9''

3.7.1. The chain of narrators of reports
The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (g)
did not doubt
one another after he died, and the Tihi'oon never hesitated to accept
any hadith that was narrated by a Companion from the Messenger of
Allah (g),
hut this changed when fitnah arose and the wretched
~ h d u l l a hibn Saha' started preaching his evil ideas, which were
based on an extreme form of Shiism that claimed that 'Ali (&) was
divine. He began to fabricate reports and insert them into the Sunnah,
and the number of fabricated reports accumulated with the passage of
time. At this point, the scholars among the Companions and the
T2hi'oon became very careful about the transmission of hadith, and
they would not accept any report unless they knew its chain of
narration and narrators and were satisfied with their trustworthiness
and good character.
Ibn Sireen said, as was narrated by Imam Muslim in the
introduction to his collection of sound hadiths: "They used not to ask
about chains of narration, hut when the fitnah occurred, they said:
'Name for us your men (in the chain of narration)."' They would find
out who were followers of the Sunnah and accept their hadiths, and
they would find out about who were followers of innovation and
reject their hadiths. This checking began at the time of the younger
Companions who were still alive at the time of fitnah.
Muslim narrated, in the introduction to his collection of sound
hadiths, that Mujaid said: "Basheer al-'Adawi came to Ibn 'Abhb
and started narrating to him, saying: 'The Messenger of Allah (gJ
said, the Messenger of AUah (g)
said.' Ibn 'Ahhis did not listen to
his reports and did not even look at him. He said: '0 Ibn 'Abhb, why
is it that I do not see you listening to what I tell you? I am narrating to

'Aliibn Abi Trilib

543

you from the Messenger of Allah (B),
and you are not listening.' Ibn
'Abbb said: 'At one time, if we heard a man say, "The Messenger of
Allah (g)
~.
, said," we would all turn to look at him and listen to him.
But when the people started to narrate a great deal, we did not accept
from the people anything but that which we were familiar with.' Then
when lying became widespread, the Tftbi'oon began to ask for chains
of narration. Abu al-'Aliyah said: 'We used to hear hadiths from the
Companions, hut we would not be content until we went to them and
heard it from them.' Ibn al-Mub%ak said: 'The chain of narration is
part of the religion. Were it not for the chain of narration, anyone
could say what they wanted.' Ibn al-Mubkak also said: 'Between us
and the people are the lists' - meaning chains of narration."978

3.7.2. Verifying hadiths
This was done by referring to the Companions, Tibi'oon and
prominent scholars in this field. It is a sign of Allah's preserving the
Sunnah of His Prophet that He made the lives of some prominent
Companions and scholars among them long, so that they could serve
as a reference point and people could be guided through them. When
the fabrication of hadiths began, the people turned to these
Companions first, asking them what they knew of hadiths and seeking
their advice concerning the hadiths and reports they heard. Many trips
were made by the Tibi'oon, and even some of the Companions, from
one country to another for that purpose, so that they could hear proven
hadiths from trustworthy narrators. Hence J2hir ibn Abdullah
travelled to Syria, and Abu Ayyoob travelled to Egypt to hear hadiths.

3.7.3. Critical examination of narrators,
highlighting how truthful they were
This is a very important field, through which the scholars were
able to distinguish sound from fabricated hadiths, strong from weak.

544

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijitcs and Shia

They did very well in this regard, tracing narrators and studying their
lives, history and biography, what was hidden about them and what
was known, never fearing the blame of the
They set out guidelines and rules and applied them in order to
determine whose reports were to he accepted and whose were to he
rejected, whose reports were to be written down and whose reports
were not to he written down. Among the most important categories of
rejected reporters, whose hadiths are not to be accepted, are:
3.7.3.a. Those w h o tell lies about
the Messenger of Allah (&)
The scholars unanimously agreed that the hadith of one who
tells lies about the Prophet
is not to be accepted. They also
unanimously agreed that this is the gravest of major sins, but they
differed as to whether such a person is a disbeliever or not. Some said
that he is a disbeliever, and some said that he is to he executed, and
they differed as to whether his repentance is acceptable or not.

(s)

3.7.3.b. Those who tell lies in their general talk, even if
they d o not tell lies about the Messenger of Allah (&)
The scholars unanimously agree that if a person is known to
have told a lie, even once, his hadith is to he rejected.
3.7.3.c. Followers of innovation and whims and desires
The scholars also agreed that no hadith can be accepted from a
follower of innovation if his innovation constitutes dishelief. If his
innovation does not constitute disbelief, hut he regards lying as
permissible, his hadiths are not accepted either. What if he follows an
innovation that does not constitute disbelief and he does not regard
lying as permissible - can his reports he accepted or not? Is there a
differentiation between one who promotes innovation and calls
others to it, and one who does not? Ibn Katheer said: "Concerning
this issue, there has been a dispute from early times until more

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

545

recently. The view of the majority is that there should be
differentiation between one who promotes innovation and one who
does not."980 What appears to me to be correct is that the scholars
reject a narrator who follows innovation if he narrates something that
supports his innovation, or if his group is known to regard lying as
permissible and to fabricate hadiths in support of their whims and
desires. Hence they rejected the reports of the Rifidis, but they would
accept the report of an innovator if he and his group did not regard
lying as permissible, such as 'Inxiin ibn ~ a ~ i i n ? ~ '

3.7.3.d. Rejecting the reports of heretics and others
The scholars are agreed that the reports of the following people
are to be rejected: heretics, evildoers, heedless people who do not
understand what they are narrating, and anyone who does not meet
the conditions of precision, good character and understanding.
The scholars of hadith established guidelines for determining
what is sound, reliable and weak in categorizing hadith. They also set
out guidelines for determining what is fabricated, and they mentioned
the signs by which this might be known, such as poor language,
unsound meanings, being contrary to the clear meaning of the
Qur'an, contradicting the known facts of history at the time of the
Prophet
and others.982

(s)

By means of these successful efforts, the Islamic religion was
preserved. The foundation of the Sunuab, which is the second source
of legislation, was established, and the Muslims felt reassured with
regard to the hadiths of their Prophet (g).
Everything alien was
removed, and the distinctions between what was sound, reliable and
weak were established. Allah ( B )protected His religion from
tampering by those who sought to corrupt it and those who were
trying to insert fabricated reports, and from the plots of the heretics
and the shu'oobiyyah. The Muslims reaped the harvest of this blessed
and mighty effort, among the most prominent features of which were

the writing down of the Sunnah, the science of hadith, the science of

The attitude of the Shia towards the Sunnah, due to
the Shia regarding the Companions as disbelievers
The Shiite opinion on imamate led them to regard the
overwhelming majority of the Companions (&) as disbelievers. As
a result of this abhorrent view, the Shia rejected almost all of the
hadiths that were narrated through the Companions; they only
accepted hadiths that were narrated through the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt
or those whom they claimed were Shia, like Salm2n d-Fkisi,
'Amm2r ihn Ygsir, Ahn Dharr and al-Miqdzd ibn d-Aswad. They
launched a relentless attack on narrators of hadith such as Abu
Hurayrah, Samurah ibn Junduh, 'Urwah ibn ai-Zubayr, 'Amr ibn al'AS, al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah and others; they accuse them of
fabricating, forging and lying.984 Imam 'Abdul-Q&ir al-Baghdadi
regarded the Shia as being among those who rejected the Sunnah
because they refused to accept the reports of the Companions of the
Messenger of guidance (g).985

(
This is what was
mentioned in some of the sources of Ah1 as-Sunnah, but the Shia
narrate from their Imams that everything is to be referred to the
Qur'an and Sunnah, and that every hadith that is not in accordance
with the Qur'an and Sunnah is invalid.987 They also have other
reports l i e this.988This means that the Shia do not deny the Sunnah
of the Messenger of Allah (g);
they do refer to it and regard it as
parallel to the Book of ~ i a has the criterion and final word.
However, the one who studies their texts and reports will reach the
conclusion that most of their reports and views head in a direction

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

547

away from the Sunnah that is known to the Muslims, in terms of
interpretation and application as well as chains of narration and texts.

The word of the Imam is like the
word of Allah and His Messenger
For the Shia, the Sunnah is everything that was narrated from
the 'infallible one', whether word, deed or approval?8y The one who
does not understand the nature of their madh-hab will not realise the
extent to which they have drifted away from the Sunnah in this
statement. The 'infallible one' refers not only to the Messenger of
but also to any of those whose word they regard as equal to
Allah (g)
the word of Allah and the words of His Messenger, namely the
twelve Imams. They do not differentiate in this regard between these
twelve Imams and the one who does not speak of his own desire,
whose speech is only a Revelation r e v e a ~ e d ~ ~Prophet
~ t h e(s)?~'
These Imams are not treated like others who narrated from the
Prophet, whose words become binding on the basis that they are
trustwoahy in narration. They believe that these 'infallible ones'
were appointed by Allah (sf,
as mentioned by Prophet, to convey
the divine rulings, and that they do not speak of anything except that
which comes from Allah (s).'~'
There is also no differentiation between what these twelve
Imams said at the age of childhood and what they said at the age of
maturity, because in the view of the Shia, they cannot err - either
deliberately or accidentally or as a result of forgetfulness - at any
time throughout their lives, as we have seen above in the discussion
of the issue of infallibility. Hence one of their contemporasy shaykhs
said: "Belief in the infallibility of the lmams makes whatever they
utter sound, without stipulating a condition that it should have a chain
of narration going back to the Prophet
as is the case with Ahl as~ u n n a h . "For
~ ~them,
~
the Sunnah is not only the Sunnah of the

(e),

548

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Prophet; rather it is the Sunnah of the Imams, and the words of these
Imams are like the words of Allah and His Messenger. They admit
that this is what the Shia added to the Sunnah, saying: "The Imami
Shia added everything that was said or done by the twelve Imams of
words, deeds or approval, to the Sunnah of the Prophet (g)."994
Their view stems from two serious matters and two principles,
which for them are basic to this issue. One of their contemporary
shaykhs pointed out these two things when he explained that
whatever the Imams said is at the same level as the words of the
Prophet (&) in that it is binding and must be followed, and that
whatever ruling they pass is the ruling ordained by Allah. He
explained that this knowledge could be attained for them in two
ways: "through inspiration like the Prophet, i.e., through revelation,
or through learning it from the infallible one who came before
him."995

They claim that the Imams are the guardians of the knowledge
and revelation of Allah ($1. The author of al-Ki?fi wrote a chapter
with the title: "The Imams (m)are in charge of executing the
commands of Allah (%) and are the guardians of His
~ n o w l e d ~ e .In" ~this
~ ~ chapter, there are six reports to that
effect. He wrote another chapter entitled: "The Imams inherited the
knowledge of the Prophet and all the Prophets and the appointed
heirs who came before them,""'
in which there are seven such
reports. In a third chapter, entitled "The Imams know all branches of
knowledge that are known to the Angels, Prophets and Messengers
(m),"998 there are four
The R2fifidiShia went to extremes
with this issue. What we have quoted from these imaginary sources
claimed by the Shia is enough; simply reading it and imagining its
implications is sufficient to show how corrupt it is.
As a result of that concept of the Imams, the Rifidi Shia did
not pay attention to the soundness of the chain of narration or study

I

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

549

and evaluate the narrators, as the scholars of hadith did. At the same
time that they reject the collections of sound hadithsof Bukhari and
Muslim and the books of the Sunnah that are authenticated and
sound, they rely for their hadiths on what was narrated by al-Kulayni,
whose comments on many of their beliefs we have quoted above.
They regard him as one whose view is binding and sound beyond any
doubt, and his book al-Kcifi loo' is one of the oldest hadith books of
the Shia and one of the most authentic in their view.
One of the Shia described the status of this book among them
when he said: 'The lmamis and the majority of Shia are agreed on the
superiority of this book and on following it, trusting its reports and
being content with its rulings. They unanimously agreed that it is of a
supreme status and high level, and it is the main basis for all the
narrations of the trustworthy reporters who are known for their
precision and knowledge until today."'001 For them, it is better than
all the other books of hadith, knowing that most of what is in al-Kcifi
-as Abu Zahrah says -are reports that ended with the Imams. We
cannot say that there is any hadith with a chain of narrators that goes
hack all the way to the Prophet (g)
or claims that these are the words
of the Prophet (g),
except on the basis that the words of their Imams
are the same as the words of the Prophet (@J and are part of the
religion of Allah (B).
Most of what is narrated in al-Kcifi stops at asSidiq, and very little of it goes back to his father al-Biqir. Even less
goes back to Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&), and that which goes
back to the Prophet (g)
is very rare.
There is also a book called Man la yuhduruhu al-Faqeeh,
which was compiled by Abu Ja'far Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn
Bzbawayh, whom they call ash-Shaykh as-Sadooq, one of their
greatest scholars in Khorasan (d. 381 AH). Other main references of
the Shia include Tahdheeb al-Ahkcim and al-Istibjiirfima ukhtulifa
min al-Akhbcir, by Muhammad ibn al-Hasan at-Toosi. These Shiite

550

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites andShia

books are filled with tens of thousands of reports and hadiths which
cannot be proven sound; indeed most of them are fabricated and
made up,'"' such as the reports that we have referred to previously,
on which they rely to defend the idea that 'Ali (4)
was more
entitled to the caliphate. From the above, we know the views and
beliefs of the Shia. The Shia themselves -or at least some of them
- admit that in their books there are some fabricated reports, and
they themselves criticise some of their narrators.
Since this is the case, the Shia should follow the advice of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T%b (&) when he said: "Adhere
to your religion and follow the guidance and Sunnah of your Prophet.
Measure what you do not understand against the Qur'an; whatever
the Qur'an approves of, adhere to it, and whatever it disapproves of,
reject it."'Oo3 He (&) also said: "Follow the guidance of your
Prophet (g),
for it is'the best of guidance, and follow his Suunah, for
it is the best of ways."1004
They should adhere to the path of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn
Abi T2lib (&) in understanding the rulings of the noble Qur'arl and
the meanings of its verses. They should adhere to the apparent
meaning of the noble Qnr'an, understanding the verses that are
general in meaning in the light of the verses that are specific. and
detailed. They should pay attention to what abrogates and what is
abrogated, study the language of the Arabs, understand some teats in
the light of others, ask about any verses that are unclear, understand
the reasons for revelation and learn from Arnir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
how to respect the status of prophethood and deal with the
Sunnah of the Messenger (8
in
)accordance with his guidance,
which I have discussed in this book. Then they should examine the
reports in their books on the basis of two just and precise measures:
the Book of Allah and the Snnnah of His Messenger. Whatever is in
accordance with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger

(4)

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

551

(g),
they should accept it; whatever is contrary to them, they should
reject it and w a n their followers against it, especially those reports
that undermine their Imams themselves, let alone Islam.
The religion of Allah is complete and perfect. Allah says:
(This day, I have perfected your religion for you! (Qur'an 5: 3 ) . And
the Messenger of Allah (g)
conveyed all that was revealed to him
and he followed the command of his Lord, Who said: (0 Messenger
[Muhammad]! Proclaim [the Message] which has been sent down to
you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed
His Message) (Qur'an 5: 67).
The Prophet (g)
conveyed the message clearly and
eloquently, and he established proof so that there would he no excuse
left for anyone. He proclaimed it openly among the Muslims, without
singling out anyone to tell him alone any part of Sharia and asking
him to keep it secret. Allah says: (verily, those who conceal the clear
proofs, evidences and the guidance, which We have sent down, after
We have made it clear for the people in the Book, they are the ones
cursed by Allah and cursed by the cursers. Except those who repent
and do righteous deeds, and openly declare [the truth which they
concealed]! (Qur'an 2: 159-160).
(And We have not sent down the Book [the Qur'an] to you [O
Muhammad], except that you may explain clearly unto them those
(Qur'an 16: 64)
things in which they differ.)
So the religion is complete and perfect, with nothing added or
taken away or altered,loo5not by any so-called Imam or any fictional
absent one.lw6 The Prophet (gg)bade farewell to this world after
conveying the religion in full and explaining all of it as commanded
by his Lord. He (g)

3.8. Shia view of Taqiyyah
3.8.1. Shia definition of Taqiyyah
Their shaykh al-Mufeed said: "Taqiyyah is concealing the
truth and one's belief in it, not speaking about one's beliefs to those
who are different, and not supporting them in any matter that may
cause harm in one's religious or worldly affairs.,,1009 Yoosuf d B&ki, one of their senior scholars in the twelfth century AH, said:
"What is meant by taqiyyah is to show agreement with those who
differ from us in what they believe, out of fear."1010 Khomeini said:
"The meaning of taqiyyah is for a man to say something different
than the truth or to do something contraq to the teachings of Islam, in
order to protect his life, honour or ~ e a l t h . " ' ~ " These three
definitions of taqiyyah, by three of the senior scholars of the Rifidi
Shia who came at different intervals, are based on their four main
principles of taqiyyah, which are:
*

The meaning of taqiyyah is for a person to show to another
something other than what he believes in his heart.

*:

Taqiyyah is to be used with those who differ, and it is very
clear that all of the Muslims come under this heading.

*+: Taqiyyah is used with regard to what those who differ
believe or follow in matters of religion.
+*: Taqiyyah is only to be used in the case of fear for one's
religion, life or wealth.
These four guidelines form the basis of their belief in
taqiyyah.'012

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

553

3.8.2. Status of taqiyyah among the RSfidi Shia
Taqiyyah is held in high esteem among them, as is indicated
by numerous reports in their main reference books. A-Kulayni and
others narrated from Ja'far as-Sidiq that he said: "Taqiyyah is part of
my religion and the religion of my forefathers, and the one who has
no taqiyyah has no faith."1Â°13
It was narrated from Abu Ahdullah that he said: "Nine-tenths
of religion is in taqiyyah; the one who has no taqiyyah has no faith.
Taqiyyah may be applied to everything except nabeedh (a type of
drink) and wiping over the two khuffs (leather slippers). 1014
,i

In Al-MahBsin, it is narrated from Habeeb ihn Basheer from
Abu Abdullah that he said: "No, by Allah, nothing on earth is dearer
to me than taqiyyah. 0 Habeeb, the one who has taqiyyah will be
raised in status by Allah; 0 Habeeb, the one who has no taqiyyah will
be humiliated by ~ ~ l a h . " 'In
~ 'at-Toosi's
~
Al-A&li, it is narrated
from Ja'far as-Sidiq that he said: "He is not one of us who does not
adhere to taqiyyah and preserve our dignity before the base
In Al-Ufool al-Asliyyah it is narrated from 'Ali ibn
Muhammad that Diwood as-Sarmi said: "He said to me: '0 Dzwood,
if I told you that the one who forsakes taqiyyah is like the one who
forsakes prayer, it would be
It was narrated from Biqir that he was asked: "Who is the most
perfect of people?' He said: "The one who adheres most to taqiyyah
and takes care of his brothers the most."'018 It was also narrated that
he said: "The noblest characteristic of the virtuous Imams of our sect
is the use of taqiyyah."'019
These reports illustrate the high status of taqiyyah in their view
and its importance in their religion. For the Rzfidi Shia, taqiyyah is
one of the most important fundamentals of religion; the one who has
no taqiyyah has no faith, and the one who forsakes taqiyyah is like

554

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

the one who forsakes prayer. In fact, taqiyyah in their view is better
than all the pillars of Islam. Taqiyyah represents nine-tenths of their
religion, and all the pillars and obligatory duties of Islam represent
the remaining ~ne-tenth.'~'~
The author of al-Kifi narrated reports
under the headings: 'Chapter on taqiyyah,'1021 'Chapter on
concealment,"022 and 'Chapter on speaking openly."023 Al-Majlisi
quoted one hundred and nine of their reports in Bihrir al-Anwir in a
chapter called 'Taqiyyah' and being kind for fear of hostility.10Z4

3.8.3. Causes of this exaggeration
with regard to taqiyyah
This exaggeration with regard to taqiyyah is due to a number
of things, such as:
3.8.3.a. Their view that the rulership
of the first three caliphs w a s invalid
The RXldi Shia regarded the rnlership of the first three caliphs
as invalid. They and those who swore allegiance to them are regarded
as disbelievers, even though 'Ali (&) swore allegiance to them,
prayed behind them, fought in jihad alongside them, gave his
daughter Umm Kulthoom in marriage to 'Umar (&) and had a
concubine whom he received from his jihad with Abn Bakr (&).
When he was appointed caliph, he followed in their footsteps and did
not change anything that Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased
with them) did, as the books of the Shia themselves admit.
This proves that the Shiite madh-hab is invalid from its
foundations. They tried to escape these overwhelming contradictions
by using the principle of taqiyyah1025to explain the events of their
histoty. They suggested that 'Ali's keeping quiet about Abu Bakr
(&) was taqiyyah, and al-Hasan ibn 'Ali's yielding the caliphate to
Mu'iwiyah was taqiyyah, and the disappearance and concealment of

i

i

'Aliibn Abi Tilib

555

their Imams was taqiyyah. Thus it is possible to explain all events
that contradict their beliefs by means of taqiyyah.'0z6
3.8.3.b. Their claim that the Imams were infallible
They claimed that the Imams were infallible; they were not
heedless, and they did not err or forget. However, this claim is
c o n t r q to what is known of their lives. Even the reports of the Shia
themselves, which are attributed to the Imams, differ and contradict
one another to the extent that there is no report without another one
that contradicts it, as was acknowledged by their shaykh a t - ~ o o s i . ' ~ ~ '
It is obvious that this cancels out the very foundation of the principle
of infallibility, so they came up with the idea of taqiyyah to explain
these contradictions and differences and to cover up their lies about
the Imams.
The author of al-Ktji narrated that Mansoor ibn Hbim said: "I
said to Abu Abdullah
'Why is it that sometimes I ask you about
an issue and you give me an answer, then someone else comes to you
and you give him a different answer?' He said: 'We answer people on
the basis of giving more or less.'"1028 The commentator on al-Kiji
said that this means that they: "are more strict when using taqiyyah,
and less so when there is no taqiyyah. That is not because of
forgetfulness or ignorance; it is because they know that differences
among the Shia are better for them and more conducive to their
survival, because if they were united in their views, they would be
known for being Shia, and that could be a reason for killing them and
killing the Imams."1029

(m):

3.8.3.c. Making the mission of those who
fabricate lies about the Imams easy
Another factor is the aim of making the mission of those who
fabricate lies about the Imams easy and tqing to conceal the real
madh-hab of Ah1 al-Bayt. They hied to give the impression to their

556

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

followers that what they (those who lay down the principle of
taqiyyah) transmitted from the Imams was their true madh-hab,
whereas the well known sayings and actions of the Imams of Ah1 d Bayt in front of the Muslims did not represent their m e madh-hab
because they did that on the basis of taqiyyah. Using this ploy, it
became easy for them to fabricate words and attribute them to the
Imams, even as they rejected what was narrated from them of truth.
So, for example, you will find them rejecting the words of Imam
Muhammad d-Biqir or Ja'far as-Sidiq that were said in front of
people or that were narrated by Muslims of good character, on the
grounds that some Sunnis were present, so he 'used taqiyyah in his
words'. On the other hand, they accept what is narrated by fabricators
such as Jibir al-Ja'fi alone, on the grounds that there was no one
present when he spoke whose presence would necessitate the use of
taqiyyah.
It is sufficient for you to know that Imam Zayd ibn 'Ali, who is
one of Ah1 al-Bayt, narrated from 'Ali
as is reported in the
books of the Twelver Shia themselves - that he washed his feet
when doing wudoo', but the one they call Shaykh at-Ti'ifah does not
accept this hadith and cannot find any reason for rejecting it except
taqiyyah. He rejected the badith, which was narrated in al-Zstib~6r
from Zayd ibn 'Ali from his grandfather 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib, who said:
"I was sitting and doing wudoo', and the Messenger of AUah (@)
came when I started doing wudoo' ... and I washed my feet, and he
said to me: '0 'ALi, let water go between the toes, lest the fire go
between them.rr,1030 So you can see that 'Ali used to wash his feet
during wudoo', and the Messenger of Allah (@) confirmed that he
should let the water go between his toes. However, the Shia went
against the Sunnah of the Messenger of AUah (@) and the practice of
'Ali (&)
. . with regard to that and paid no attention to such reports,
even when they were narrated in their own books from the Imams of
Ah1 al-Bayt. The Shiite shaykhs themselves never bothered to think

(4)
-

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

557

about these reports or examine them; they always have this readymade excuse of taqiyyah.'03i
Hence at-Toosi said: "This report is in accordance with the
masses - meaning Ah1 as-Sunnah - but it is to be interpreted as
being taqiyyah because of what is known without any doubt of the
view of our Imams
namely that the feet should be wiped."
Then he said: "The narrators of this report are all of the masses
(Sunnis) or men of the Zaydi sect; if they narrate a report supporting
some of their ideas or practices,'032 we do not accept it."

(m),

With regard to marriage, they have reports that mention the
prohibition on temporary, fixed-term marriage. In their books, it is
narrated from Zayd ibn 'Ali from his forefathers from 'Ali (&) that
he said: "On the day of Khaybar, the Messenger of Allah (@)forbade
the flesh of domesticated donkeys and temporary marriage.ir1033
Their Shaykh al-Hun al-'Ami~i said: "I say: The ~ h a ~ k and
h ' ~ ~ ~
others interpreted it as being taqiyyah (in the report), because the
permissibility of temporary marriage is one of the fundamentals of
the Imami madh-hab."1035
With regard to the division of inheritance, a woman cannot
inherit anything of property, houses or land."36 There is a report
from the Imams contradicting that - namely the hadith of Abu
Ya'qoob from Abu Abdullah, who said: "I asked him about the man:
does he inherit anything of the house or the land of his wife, or is he
in the same position as the woman, so he should not inherit anything
from her? He said: 'He inherits from her, and she inherits from him,
everything that he or she leaves behind."1037 At-Toosi said: "We
interpret this as being taqiyyah, because everyone who disagrees with
us disagrees with us on this issue, and none of the masses (the
Sunnis) agree with us on this issue. In such cases, we may interpret it
as being taqiyyah. x 1038

3.8.3.d. The principle of taqiyyah w a s
established in order t o isolate
the Shia from the Muslims
Their Imam Abu Abdullah said: "Whatever you hear from me
that resembles the view of the people (meaning Ah1 as-Sunnah) is
taqiyyah, and whatever you hear from me that does not resemble tbe
view of the people is not taqiyyah."'039 The result of this belief in
taqiyyah was that the views of the Imams were lost to the Shia; even
their shaykhs do not know, with regard to the views of the Imams
narrated in the reports, what is taqiyyah and what is true.'040 They set
up a method of judging what is true, and it brought the entire madhhab into extremism; what they decided is that whatever is contrary to
the masses (meaning Abl as-Sunnah) is guidance.1w1

The author of al-Hadri'iq admitted that because of taqiyyah,
only a few of the rulings of their religion are known for certain. He
said: "Therefore none of the rulings of Islam were known on the basis
of certainty except a few, because the reports narrated (from the
Imams) are mixed with other reports that are interpreted as being
taqiyyah." This was also admitted by 'the trustworthy one of Islam'
Muhammad ibn Ya'qoob al-Kulayni in his book al-K63. He got so
confused that when there were conflicting reports, he no longer paid
attention to what was thought most likely to be correct, and he
resorted to merely submitting to and accepting whatever was narrated
from the ~rnams.'"~

With regard to how they apply taqiyyah among the Shia, there
are reports showing that their taqiyyah is not connected to cases of
necessity. Yoosuf al-B&iini admitted that the Imams may give
contradictory rulings even if none of those people (Sunnis) were
present, so we see them giving several different answers concerning
one issue, even if none of them are similar to the Sunni view.lw3

3.8.4. Concept of taqiyyah among Ah1 as-Sunnah
The concept of taqiyyah in Islam is, in most cases, to be used
with the disbelievers. Allah (&) says: d... except if you indeed fear a
danger from them) (Qur'an 3: 28). Ibn Jareer at-Tabari said: "The
taqiyyah mentioned by Allah in this verse is taqiyyah used with the
disbelievers and no one e l ~ e . " For
' ~ this reason, some members of
the early generation thought that there should be no taqiyyah after
Allah ( B )caused Islam to prevail. Mu'2dh ibn Jabal and Muj2hid
said: "Taqiyyah was to be used at the beginning of Islam, before the
Muslims prevailed, but today Allah ( B )has caused the Muslims to
prevail, and there is no danger to be feared."1045
On the contrary, the Shias use taqiyyah with the Muslims,
especially the Sunnis, to the extent that they think that the era of the
best generations was an era of taqiyyah. This was stated by their
shaykh al-Mufeed, and it may be noticed in the texts that are
attributed to their Imams. They regard Ah1 as-Sunnah as being worse
in disbelief than the Jews and Christians because in their view, the
one who denies the imamate of the twelve Imams is worse than the
one who denies p r ~ ~ h e t h o o d . ~ ~ ~
The correct view is that taqiyyah is a concession in cases of
necessity. Hence AUah (&)made an exception to the principle that it
is forbidden to become close friends with the disbelievers when He
said: (Let not the believers take the disbelievers as Awliyri'
[supporters, helpers] instead of the believers, and whoever does that,
will never be helped by Allah in any way, except if you indeed fear a
danger from them. And Allah warns you against Himself [His
punishment], and to Allah is the final return) (Qur'an 3: 28). He
issued a statement warning against that in the words 'and whoever
does that'. In other words, whoever does what Allah (&) has
forbidden has nothing to do with Allah (&). Then He said: 'except if
you indeed fear a danger from them,' meaning that whoever fears

560

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

their evil in certain places and at certain times may dissemble or
conceal his religion outwardly but not inwardly; his intention must
stay true.'047
The scholars unanimously agree that taqiyyah is a concession
allowed in cases of necessity. Ibn al-Mundhir said: "They were
unanimously agreed that the one who is forced to disbelieve, to the
extent that be fears he may he killed, and speaks words of disbelief
although his heart is at rest with faithlo4' is not to be deemed a
di~believer,"~~
but the one who chooses resolve in such a situation is
better." Ibn Bag2 said: "They agreed that the one who is forced to
disbelieve and chooses to be killed will have a greater reward with
Allah
Taqiyyah according to the Shiite view is something
quite different, though. For them it is not a concession; it is one of the
pillars of their religion.'051
Islam is the religion of jihad and calling others to the faith, so
taqiyyah cannot be a basic principle and something that is entrenched
in the behaviour of the Muslim or a characteristic of the Muslim
society. On the contrruy, in most cases it is something temporary that
is used in individual cases of necessity, and it is related to being
unable to migrate; when the situation of compulsion ends, it is no
longer to he used. According to the Shiite madh-hab, however, it is
regarded as something natural and an essential part of the madh-hab.
It is an ongoing and permanent part of social h e h a v i o ~ r . 'The
~~~
scholars have stated, based on their knowledge of the situation of the
Shia, that their taqiyyah is nothing but lies and hypocrisy.
Ibn Taymiyah differentiated between the taqiyyah of
hypocrisy and the taqiyyah that is allowed in Islam. He said that the
taqiyyah allowed in Islam "does not mean telling lies and speaking
with my tongue something different from what is in my heart, for that
is hypocrisy. Instead, I do what I am able to. If the believer is among
disbelievers and evildoers, he does not have to strive in physical jihad

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

561

against them when he is not able to do so, but if he is able to do that
verbally, then be should do that. Otherwise he should do that in his
heart, but still he should not lie and say with his tongue something
that is not in his heart; he should practice his religion either openly or
concealing it. Nevertheless, he should still not show agreement with
everything in their religion; rather the most that his taqiyyah may
involve is for him to be like the believer in the household of Pharaoh;
he did not show agreement with them with regard to all of their
religion, but at the same time he did not lie or say anything.
Outwardly pretending to follow the false religion is something else
altogether; Allah ( B )did not allow that at all except in the case of
one who is forced and compelled to such a degree that he has to speak
words of disbelief. Allah (&) may excuse him for that, but the
hypocrite and liar will not be excused at all. Moreover, the believer
who lives among the disbelievers and has no other choice and is
concealing his faith should treat them in accordance with the faith in
his heart, on the basis of sincerity, wishing them well even if he does
not agree with their religion, as Yoosuf as-Siddeeq did with the
people of Egypt, who were disbelievers. This is unlike the Rififidiwho
does not leave any harmful action that he is able to do without doing
it to those who differ from him."1053
Shaykh S h i n al-'Awdah summed up the differences in the
way taqiyyah is understood by Ahl as-Sunnah and the Rzfidis,
saying: "Taqiyyah, for Ah1 as-Sunnah, is a t e m p o r q exception that
is different from the norm, but for the Shia it is something that is
obligatory and enjoined until the return of the hidden Imam of Ah1 alBayt. Acting on the basis of taqiyyah, for Ahl as-Sunnah, ends as
soon as the reason for it ends, hut for the Shia, it is an ongoing
obligation for all that will not end until the appearance of their
Mahdi, who will never emerge. The taqiyyah of Ahl as-Sunnah is to
be used with the disbelievers in most cases, although it may be used
with evildoers and oppressors, but the taqiyyah of the Shia is, in

562

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

principle, to be used with Muslims who differ from them, namely Ahl
as-Sunnah. For Ahl asSunnah, taqiyyah is something that is done
reluctantly, and the Muslim resorts to it without feeling happy or at
ease with it, but for the Shia, it is a characteristic that is regarded as
praiseworthy and good, and there are many texts from their Imams
that praise it. r r 1 0 5 4

3.9. The awaited Mahdi
between Shiites and S u d s
3.9.1. Shiite belief in the awaited Mahdi
One of the most prominent beliefs of the R%& Shia, with
which their books are filled, is belief in the awaited Mahdi. What the
Imami R2fidis mean by the awaited Mahdi is Muhammad ibn d Hasan alL6Askari,who is their twelfth Imam and whom they call 'the
proof' and 'the one who stands for the h - ~ t h ' . They
' ~ ~ ~claim that he
was bom in 255 AH and that he hid in the tunnel of ~ a m a r r ain
'~~~
265 AH; they are waiting for his appearance at the end of time, when
he will avenge them against their enemies and support them.'057 The
R%& Shia still visit the tunnel of ~ a m a r r a and
' ~ ~call
~ upon him to
1059
emerge.

In fact, this Mahdi who is claimed by the Rx&s is nonexistent. Al-Hasan al-'Askari, whom they name as his father, died
without leaving any child behind; his estate was divided between his
mother and his brother Ja'far. This Shiite belief in the awaited Mahdi
is accompanied by many myths and fables that no rational person
could believe. They believe that the Mahdi is one of the descendants
of d - ~ n s a ~ nand
, ' ~they
~ ~narrate strange stories about him.'"'
They say that when he emerges, the R2fidi Shia will come
from all over to rally around him.lM2 He will bring the Companions

i

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

563

out of their graves and punish them;'06' he will kill the Arabs and
~ u r a ~ s b ; 'he
O~
will
~ destroy the Ka'bah, the Prophet's Mosque and
all other mosques;'065 he will call people to a new religion, a new
book and new laws;'0G6and he will conquer cities with the Ark of the
Covenant of the ~ e w s . ' ~Two
~ ' springs, of water and milk, will flow
for him, and one Shiite Rififidi man will gain the strength of forty
men; he will give them strength and power in their hearing and
vision, and he will rule according to the law of the family of
DZ~ood.'~~~
The beliefs of the Rifidi Shia concerning their awaited Mahdi
are false. This fact is indicated by a number of things:
3.9.1.a. It is proven that this Mahdi was not born
By the wisdom of Allah (g),
it was decreed that al-Hasan al'Askari, the eleventh h a m of the Rzfidis, should die childless. This
was a great scandal and a major setback for the RZtfidi Shia: how
could the Imam die without having any sons who could succeed him
as Imam? Their belief is that the one who succeeds the imam after his
death must be his son, and it is not permissible for the imamate to be
passed to a brother after al-Hasan and a l - ~ u s a ~ nThe
. ' ~fact
~ ~ that
this Mahdi was not born is proven in the books of the Shia
them~elves.'"~

3.9.1.b. It makes no sense for the Mahdi to disappear
If we accept for argument's sake that this Mahdi was born, it
makes no sense for him to disappear for this long time in the tunnel.
When the Ri&&
Shia are asked about the wisdom behind his
disappearance in the tunnel and his not coming out to the people, they
explain that he feared for his life.'07' This is a weak excuse, and
many things show this to he false. It is narrated in their books that he
will be supported by Allah
and will gain control of the entire
earth, east and west. He will fill the earth with justice as it was filled

(s)

564

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

with injustice, and he will live until the time when 'Eesa ibn Maryam
[Jesus the son of Mary (@)I descend^.'"^
What they say means that the Mahdi will never emerge until
the states of injustice and oppression and evil go away, so that he can
feel that his life is safe - but at that time there will be no need for
him to emerge. These states are able to protect him if he emerges, so
why does he not emerge? The one who cannot protect himself from
being killed will not he able to protect others either, because the one
who does not have a thing cannot give it. How can they he waiting for
someone like that to avenge them against their enemies and cause
them to prevail? Thus their claims are proven invalid, because the
reason why the Mahdi has not emerged is that he fears for his life.
Based on that, the claim that the Mahdi existed at all is rendered
invalid, because nothing is preventing him from coming out of hiding
except fear for his life, as was clearly stated by Shaykh at-Ti'ifah at~ o o s i . So
' ~ the
~ ~claims about the existence of the Mahdi are proven
false by the testimony of their own scholars, and this is by the grace
of Allah

(s).

3.9.l.c. N o benefit has been
achieved by this Mahdi
Another indication of the falseness of the Rzfidi Shiite belief
in the awaited Mahdi is that this Mahdi, who the Rsfi&s claim will
emerge, has not achieved any interest, religious or worldly, and the
Muslims have not benefited from him at all, either the Rifidis or any
others. Ibn Taymiyah said: ''This infallible one, whom they claim
was born at some time more than four hundred and fifty years
ago,1074entered the tunnel, according to them, in 260 AH, when he
was five years old according to some of them, or younger than that
according to others. He did not do anything that the infallible Imam
does. What benefits can there be in the existence of such a one, even
if he did exist? So how about if he never existed at all? What blessing

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

565

or benefit did those who believed in this infallible one attain by
means of him in their religious or worldly interests?...This figure in
whom the R z d i s believe must he either absent, according to them,
or non-existent, according to people of reason. Whatever the case,
there is no benefit to anyone in either religious or worldly terms."'075
The Twelver Shia nowadays have gone against this belief in practical
terms through their belief in the theory of 'guardianship of the jurist',
which allows ruling and governing by an ordinary Muslim who is not
infallible and for whom there is no instruction or text from Allah (&)
and His Messenger
provided that he has knowledge and is of
good character.

3.9.2. The belief of AN as-Sunnah
wal-Jam2ah in the Mahdi
The sound hadiths state that at the end of time, Allah (g)
will
bring forth a man from Ah1 al-Bayt through whom Allah ($$) will
cause Islam to prevail. He will rule for seven years, filling the earth
with justice and peace as it had been filled with injustice and
oppression. During his rule, the Ummah will enjoy blessings that it
never enjoyed before; the earth will bring forth its vegetation, the sky
will send down rain, and he will give wealth without measure. The
following are some of these hadiths:

It was narrated from Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (&) that the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "At the end of my Ummah, the Mahdi
will appear. Allah will send a great deal of rain for him, the earth will
bring forth its vegetation, and he will distribute wealth equally
among the people. The numbers of livestock will increase, and the
Ummah will become great. He will live for seven or eight"'076
years.'077

566

'Ali's attitudc towards the Kharijite.~and Shia

It was also narrated from Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (&) that the
Messenger of Allah (g)
said: "The Hour will not begin until the
earth is filled with oppression and enmity. Then a man from my
family will emerge, and he will fill it with fairness and justice as it
was filled with oppression and enmity."'078
3.9.2.c.

It was narrated that Thawbk (&) said: "The Messenger of
Allah (g)
said: 'Three will fight one another for your treasure, each
one of them the son of a caliph, but none of them will gain it. Then
the black banners will come from the east, and they will kill you in an
unprecedented manner.' He mentioned something that I do not
remember, then he said: 'When you see him, pledge your allegiance
to him even if you have to crawl over the snow, for that is the caliph
of Allah, the ~ a h d i . " " ~ ~ ~
Ibn Katheer said: "What is meant by the treasure mentioned in
this report is the treasure of the Ka'bah, three sons of caliphs will be
killed fighting for it until, at the end of time, the Mahdi will appear.
His appearance will be from a land in the east, not from the tunnel of
Samarra in which the ignorant RSlfidis claim he has been until now,
where they are waiting for him to emerge at the end of time. This is a
kind of madness and a great deal of misguidance from Satan, because
there is no proof or evidence for that, either from the Qur'an or the
Sunnah, or any rational evidence.... He will be supported by people
from the east, who will establish his rule. Their banners will be black,
which is the colour of dignity, because the banner of the Messenger
of Allah (g)
was black and was called al- 'Iqrib... What is meant is
that the promised, praiseworthy Mahdi who will appear at the end of
time will originate and appear and emerge from the east, and
allegiance will be sworn to him at the Ka'bah, as is indicated by some
hadith~."'~~~

It was narrated that Abu Hurayrah (&) said that he heard the

It was narrated that Jibir ibn Abdullah (&) said that he heard
the Messenger of Allah (gg)
say: "A group among my Ummah will
continue to fight for the truth and will prevail until the Day of
Resurrection. 'Eesa ibn Maryam will descend, and their leader will
say: 'Come and lead us in prayer,' but he will say: 'No, you are
leaders of one another,' as an honour from Allah to this
~mmah."~~~'
The hadiths, which are narrated in Bukhari and Muslim,
indicate two things:

(s)

(i) That when 'Eesa ibn Maryam
descends from heaven,
the one in charge of the Muslims will be one of them.
(ii) That their ruler will be there to lead the Muslims in prayer,
and the fact that he will ask 'Eesa (5s)to lead them in
prayer when he descends indicates that this ruler will be
righteous and guided.
There are other hadiths in the Sunans and Musnads and
elsewhere that explain these hadiths that appear in Bukhari and
Muslim, they indicate that the name of that righteous man will be
Muhammad ibn Abdullah and he will be called the Mahdi. The
reports of the Sunnah support and explain each another.

It was narrated that Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri (&) said that the
Messenger of Allah (B)said: "He is one of us behind whom 'Eesa
ibn Maryam will pray."1083

There is no connection at all between the Mahdi of the Sunnah
and the Mahdi of the Ri?fi@ Shia. There are many differences
between them, such as:
*:*

According to Ahl as-Sunnah, the Mahdi's name is
Muhammad ibn Abdullah, his name is the same as the
Prophet (g),
and his father's name is the same as the
Prophet's father. As for the Mahdi of the R X d i Shia, his
name is Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-'Askari.

descendants of al-Hasan (&). The Mahdi of the Rifidi
Shia is one of the descendants of d-Husayn

According to Ah1 as-Sunnah, the Mahdi will be born
naturally, and his lifespan will be natural. There is nothing
in the hadiths to indicate that he is at all different from
other people in that regard. As for the Mahdi of the R Z d i
Shia, his conception and birth happened in one night, and
he entered the tunnel when he was nine years old; now he
has been in the tunnel for more than 1150 years.

+:The
- Mahdi, according to Ahl as-Sunnah, will emerge to
support Islam and the M u s h s , and he will not
differentiate between one nation and another. As for the
Mahdi of the R%i& Shia, he will emerge to support only
the R%& Shia and to wreak vengeance on their enemies.
He will hate the Arabs and Quraysh and will give them

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

nothing hut the sword; there will he no Arabs among his
followers, according to their reports.

03 The Mahdi of Ah1 as-Sunnah will love the Companions of
the Prophet (may Allah he pleased with them); he will ask
Allah ( B )to he pleased with them and will adhere to their
way. He will also love the Mothers of the Believers (may
Allah he pleased with them) and will not mention them
except in the best terms. As for the Mahdi of the RZdi
Shia, they claim that he will hate the Companions of the
Prophet and will bring them out of their graves in order to
punish them and then hum them. He will also hate the
Mothers of the Believers and will despise the dearest of the
Prophet's wives to him, as-Siddeeqah hint as-Siddeeq

The Mahdi of Ah1 as-Sumah will act according to the

3.10. R 3 i d i Shiite belief that some people
will be brought back from the dead
Raj'ah (belief that some people will be brought hack from the
dead) is one of the basic tenets of the Shiite ma&-hah. One of their
reports says: "He is not one of us who does not believe in our Imams
coming hack."1086 Ibn Bsbawayh said in al-l'tiqridrit: "Our belief
concerning raj'ah is that it is true. ,,lo87 Al-Mufeed said: "The Imamis
are agreed that the return of many people from the dead (raj 'ah) is
inevitable."1088~t-~ubmsi,
al-Hnsr al-'Amili and other Shiite
shaykhs said: "This is something upon which all the Imami Shia
agree."loS9It is one of the fundamentals of their ma&-hah; they are
enjoined to believe in raj'ah and affirm their belief in supplications
and visits to shrines on Fridays and at all times, just as they affum
their belief in tawbed, prophethood, imamate and resurrection.1090
What is meant by raj'ah is return to this world after death.lo9'

Many Shiite groups are of the view that their Imams will return
to this life. Some say that they died and will retnrn, and others deny
that they died; they say that they are in occultation and will return.
The first one to speak of raj'ah was Ihn Saba', who did not believe
that 'Ali (&) died; he said that he had gone into occultation and will
return. The belief in raj 'ah only applied to the Imam, according to the
Saba'is, Kayshis and others, but according to the Twelvers, it

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

571

applies to the Tmam and many others. Al-Aloosi indicates that the
Shiite belief in the return of the Imam only changed to take on that
more general meaning in the third century
As for the general concept of raj 'ah among the Twelvers, it
includes three types:
(i) The twelve Imams: the Mahdi will emerge from his hiding
place and return from his absence, and the rest of the Imams
will come hack to life and return to this world after dying.
(ii) Those who usurped the caliphate - in their view - from
its legitimate rulers (the twelve Imams), namely the
caliphs of the Muslims, foremost among whom are Abu
Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmin, will he resurrected from their
graves and will return to this world so that vengeance
might he wrought upon them for taking the caliphate from
those who were entitled to it. They will be subjected to
torture, killing and crucifixion.
(iii) Ordinary people will also be resurrected, in particular
those with pure faith, namely the Shia in general, because
they are the only ones who are regarded as having faith.
This is the consensus of their reports and the sayings of
their shaykhs. Those who have nothing but disbelief will
also be resurrected; that refers to all people apart from the
weak and oppressed.1093
Hence they say, defining raj'ah, that it refers to bringing back
many of the dead to this world before the Day of ~ e s u r r e c t i o n ' ~ ~ ~
and their returning to this life after death'095 in their original
forms.1096
The shaykhs of the Shia looked for evidence in the Book of
Allah to prove this belief in raj 'ah, which they alone, among all of the
Muslims, accept. When they could not find what they were looking

572

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

for, they resorted as usual to esoteric interpretations and twisted the
meanings a great deal. They imposed their own distorted, far-fetched
interpretation in this manner so that the evidence that they produced
became evidence against them and proof of their false beliefs. Below
are some examples of their interpretation of the verses.

I

i
i

i

Their foremost interpreter of Qur'an thinks that one of the
greatest proofs of raj 'ah is to be found in the verse: (And a ban is laid
on every town [population] which We have destroyed that they shall
not return [to this world again, nor repent to Us],) (Qur'm 21: 95). He
says: "This verse is one of the greatest proofs for raj 'ah, because no
Muslim denies that all people will he brought back on the Day of
Resurrection, whether he was among those who were destroyed (as
mentioned in the verse) or not."'097 However, this verse is actually
proof against them, since it indicates that there is no raj 'ah or coming
back from the dead in this world. What it means, as was clearly stated
by Ibn 'Abbb, Abu Ja'far al-Biqir, Qat2dah and others, is that it is
forbidden for the people of any town that was destroyed because of
their sins to come hack to this world before the Day of
~esurrection.'~~~
This is like the verses in which Allah (&) says: (DO they not
see how many of the generations We have destroyed before them?
Verily, they will not return to them) (Qur'an 36: 31) and hen they
will not he able to make bequest, nor they will return to their family),
(Qur'an 36: 50). The addition of 'not' (in the phrase 'they shall not
return') in the verse from Soorat al-Anhiya' above is additional
confirmation of the negative implied by the phrase 'And a ban is
laid'. This is an example of the briUiant and precise Qur'anic style.
The reason for telling them that they will not return, even though it is
clear that they will not return, is to tell them something that will
disturb and upset them because they have lost their greatest joy,
which is their life in this world.1099

However, if what is meant in the verse is a confirmation of
raj'ah in the sense of people coming back to life on the Day of
Resurrection (and there is no doubt about that),llw then the meaning
is that it is not possible for them to avoid returning to Allah (&)for
recompense.110'
The Shiite idea of raj'ah, or coming back to this world after
death, is contrary to the clear text of the noble Qur'an and is invalid
based on the evidence of numerous texts of the Book of Allah. Allah
says: qUntLl, when death comes to one of them [those who join
partners with Allah], he says: 'My Lord! Send me back, so that I may
do good in that which I have left behind!' No! It is but a word that he
speaks; and behind them is Barzakh [a harrier] until the Day when
they will be resurrectedh (Qur'an 23: 99.100)

(s)

The words "and behind them is Barzakh (a barrier) until the
Day when they will he resurrected" clearly indicate that is no coming
back (raj'ah) at all."02
At the time of death, when they stand before the Almighty and
they see hell, the people referred to in these verses all ask to come
back to this world. But the answer, in accordance with the prior
decree of Allah (&), is that they will never return to this world.
Hence the scholars regarded the idea of returning to this world after
death (raj 'ah) as one of the most extreme degrees of the innovation of
m hi ism."^^ In Musnad Ahmad, it is narrated that '&im ibn Damurah,
who was one of the companions of 'Ali (&), said to al-Hasan ihn
'ALi: "The Shia are claiming that 'Ali will come back." Al-Hasan
said: "Those liars are lying. If we knew that, his wives would not
have remarried and his estate would not have been di~ided.""'~
The idea of raj'ah, or return to this world after death so that the
evildoers may be punished and those who did good may he rewarded,
is contrary to the nature of this world, which is not the place of

574

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

requital. BEveryone shall taste death. And only on the Day of
Resurrection shall you be paid your wages in full. And whoever is
removed away from the fire and admitted to paradise, he indeed is
successful. The life of this world is only the enjoyment of deception
[a deceiving thing].), (Qur'an 3: 185)
The Jew Ibn Saba' played a role in laying the foundations of
the principle of raj 'ah, except that he said that it only applied to 'Ali
(&); moreover, he denied that death ever befell him in the first
piace, just as the Tweivers said about the Mahdi who they claim
existed. The Imami Shia belief in raj'ah is contrary to what is well
established in Islam: that there will be no resurrection before the Day
of Resurrection and that when Allah (&) warns a disbeliever or
wrongdoer, He is only warning them about the Day of Resurrection.
It is also contrary to the verses and m u t a w 2 ~hadiths which clearly
state that there is no returning to this world before the Day of
Resurrection.

3.11. Their belief in bada'
(change in the divine decree)
Another of the basic beliefs of the Twelvers is bada', or change
in the divine decree. They exaggerated about this idea and said that
Allah (&) is never worshipped with anything better than belief in
bada';"05 Allah (&) is never glorified with anything like bada';'lo6
if the people knew what reward there is in believing in bada', they
would never stop talking about it;"07 and every Prophet sent by
Allah ($) forbade alcohol and affirmed belief in bada'.1'08 It seems
that the one who established this belief among the Twelvers is the
one whom they call 'the tnistworthy of Islam', their shaykh alKulayni (d. 328 or 329 AH). He placed this in the section on basic
beliefs in al-Kiifi, where he included it in the book of Tawheed, and
he devoted to it a chapter entitled 'Chapter on change in the divine

!

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

decree', in which he listed sixteen hadiths that are attributed to the
~mams."~~

Jf we examine the linguistic meaning of the word bada', we
find that the dictionary says that the root meaning of this word is
'appear'."'0 The word has two meanings in Arabic:
(i) Appearing after having been hidden, so one might say,
"The walls of the city appeared."
(ii) Development of a new opinion, as in, "He developed an
opinion concerning the matter. ..1111
Both of these meanings appear in the Qur'an. The first meaning is
translated in this verse as 'disclose': (And whether you disclose what
is in your own selves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for
it) (Qur'an 2: 284). The second meaning is translated in this verse as
'occurred': (Then it occurred to them, after they had seen the proofs
[of his innocence], to imprison him for a time%(Qur'an 12: 35). It is
clear in both senses that bada' signifies that ignorance or not knowing
came first, and knowing came later; both are impossible in the case of
Allah (&), and attributing them to Allah (&) is one of the worst
kinds of disbelief. How can the Twelver Shiaregard this as one of the
greatest acts of worship and claim that Allah was never glorified with
anything Wte bada'? 4Gloly be to You [O Allah]! This is a great lie.%
(Qur'an 24: 16)"'~
This evil notion appears in the books of the Jews. In the Torah,
which the Jews have distorted according to their whims and desires,
1113 it
there are texts that clearly attribute this notion to Allah (g).
seems that the Jew Ibn Saba' took this idea from his Torah and spread
it in the Muslim society that he was attempting to influence in the
name of Shiism, under the guise of calling for support for the
imamate of 'Ali (&). All the sects of the Saba'is believed in bad$
and believed that Allah always changes His decree."14 The idea was

576

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

!

then transferred to the Kaysiini or Mukhtiri group, who were
followers of al-Mukhtk ibn Abi 'Ubayd ath-Thaqafi. This group was
famous for belief in bada'; they paid a great deal of attention to it and
adhered to it as an article of faith."15
The Shiite shaykhs used to raise the morale of their followers
by affirming that authority would return to them and they would be in
control. They even gave a time scale of seventy years, according to a
report attributed to Abu Ja'far. When those seventy years had passed
and the promise was not fulfilled, the followers complained, so the
founder of the mad-hab tried to find a solution to this dilemma by
suggesting that something had occurred @ada') to Allah (&), which
dictated that He should change this promise.1116
The noble Qur'an afhnns the divine attribute of knowledge
and thus the falsehood of the RZfidi Shia's belief in bada' or changes
in the divine decree, which implies attribution of ignorance to ~ i ' m
(&). The verses which a f f m the divine attribute of knowledge are
many, such as the following: (And with Him are the keys of the
Ghayh [all that is hidden], none knows them but He. And He knows
whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but He
knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything
fresh or dry,but is written in a Clear Record. It is He Who takes your
souls by night [when you are asleep], and has knowledge of all that
you have done by day.) (Qur'an 6: 59-60)
(Should not He Who has created know? And He is the Most Kind
and Courteous [to His slaves], All-Aware [of everything].)
(Qur'an 67: 14)

Ibn Taymiyah said: This verse clearly indicates that He must
have knowledge of all things, on the basis of the following rational

'Ali ibn Abi TLilib

577

(i) He is the Creator of all things, and creation means bringing
things into existence according to their due measurements.
That implies prior knowledge of them and their due
measurements before they can be brought into existence.
(ii) That means that there must be divine will, and will implies
that there is a prior idea of what is wanted.
(iii) These things come from Him, and He is the only complete
cause of their existence. Knowledge of the cause of these
things before they come into existence implies knowledge
of the thing that is brought into existence, so His
knowledge of Himself implies that He has knowledge of
everything that comes from Him.
(iv) He Himself is acquainted with all things, and this is what
is implied by His having knowledge of all things and
having no need of them, as He is self-sufficient in all His
attributes.""
These verses also indicate that Allah had knowledge and a
preconceived plan of this universe before He created it, based on His
prior knowledge of this universe before He brought it into existence.
Allah (s)says: $He has created everything, and has measured it
exactly according to its due measurements.) (Qur'an 25: 2)
(Who has created [everything], and then proportioned it. And Who
has measured [preordainments for everything even to be blessed or
wretched]; and then guided [i.e. showed mankind the right as well as
the wrong paths, and guided the animals to pasture].) (Qur'an 87: 2-3)
These verses contain the greatest refutation of the beliefs of the
R2fidi Shia, who claimed that Allah (&)had no knowledge of events
until after they happened, and that He might decree something and
then change His decree on the basis of new developments. Before He

578

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharifites and Shia

created this universe, Allah (&) planned and decreed it according to
its due measurements. Nothing happens in this unlverse that goes
beyond His planning and due measurements, beyond His control or
beyond what He had written in the Preserved Tablet in Heaven before
anything came into existence, but it is the signs of Allah that the
polytheists and wrongdoers deny."18
The Sunnah affirms the divine attribute of knowledge. Bukhari
narrated that the Messenger of AUah (g)
said: "The keys of the
unseen are five, and no one knows them except Allah. No one knows
what will happen tomorrow except Allah, no one knows by how
much the wombs fall short (of their time or number) or exceed except
Allah; no one knows when rain will come except Allah; no one
knows in which land he will die; and no one knows when the Hour
will begin except Allah.""19 The matters mentioned in this hadith
are all future events, and the hadith indicates that Allah ( g ) bas
knowledge of them before they happen. The Prophet (g)
said:
"Allah decided the decrees of creation fifty thousand years before He
created the heavens and the earth. And His throne was above the
water.""20
In the books of the Shia, however, there is a vast accumulation
of false reports concerning this, and there are some reports which
could be soundly attributed to the scholars of Ah1 al-Bayt. They
express the correct view on this matter, which is what befits that elite,
or they could be traces of the moderate Shia. It was narrated that
Mansoor ibn H k i m said: "I asked Abu Abdullah
whether it is
possible that something happened today that Allah ( g ) did not know
yesterday was going to happen. He said: 'May Allah humiliate the
one who says that.' I said: 'Do you not think that Allah knows what
has happened and what will happen until the Day of Resurrection?
He said: 'Of course, (He knew it) before He created creati~n."'"~'

3.12. The attitude of Ahl al-Bayt
towards the RSfidi Shia
The Imams of AN al-Bayt are like the rest of Ahl as-Sunnah in
their attitude towards the R%&s and their beliefs. They believe that
they are misguided and have gone astray from the Sunnah and
deviated from the truth, and they are among those who bate and
condemn them the most, because they attribute those corrupt beliefs
to them (Abl al-Bayt) and tell a lot of lies about them. There are
numerous statements of various kinds made by Ahl al-Bayt in
condemnation of the RZ&s and disavowing their beliefs. Among
the reports that speak of their disavowing the beliefs of the Rififidi
Shia and a f f i n g the beliefs of Ah1 as-Sunnah are the
fo~owing:"~~

3.12.1. Mutawstir report from 'Ali (&)
The mutawitir report from 'Ali (&), according to which he
said, when he was on the minbar of Kufah: "The best of this Ummah
after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then 'Umar, may Allah be pleased with
them both."1123 It was also narrated that he said: "No one gives
precedence to me over the two shaykhs but I will punish him with the
p-uiiiskmieiit of the fabricator.-1124 k,fish\&+a7d ~ ~ p ~is ~ g ~ ,
narrated that he said of 'Umar when they were carrying him to the
graveyard: "You have not left behind anyone with the like of whose
deeds I would like to meet Allah more than you. By Allah, I think that
Allah will unite you with your two Companions, because1 often heard
the Messenger of Allah (g)
say, 'Abu Bakr, 'Umar and I came; Abu
Bakr, 'Umar and I went in; Abu Bakr, 'Umar and I went out."'1125
These proven reports from Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
contradict the belief of the Shia about the two sbaykhs (Abu Bakr and
'Umar), as we have seen above. They indicate that 'Ali (&)
disavowed the Rsifidi Shia and their beliefs, and he loved and

580

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijires and Shia

supported the two shaykhs and all the Companions of the Prophet
(g).
He loved them, as we have seen above, and affiumed that the
two shaykhs were superior to him; he punished those who gave him
precedence over them, and he wished that he would meet Allah (g)
with deeds like those of 'Umar (&). May AUah be pleased with him
and with all the good and pure Companions of the Prophet who are
innocent of what these innovators, the Rifiifidi Shia and renegade
Kharijites, attributed to them. Then after 'All (&) came the words of
his sons, disavowing the Rifidis and their beliefs and their criticism
of the beliefs of Ah1 . a s - ~ u n n a h . " ~ ~

3.12.2. The words of al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (&)
It was narrated that 'Amr ibn al-Asamm said: "I said to alHasan: 'The Shia claim that 'Ali will be resurrected before the Day of
Resurrection.' He said: 'They are lying, by Allah; they are not the tme
Shia. If we knew that he wonld be resurrected, we would not have let
his wives remany and we wonld not have divided his ~ealth.""'~'
Abu Nu'aym narrated: "It was said to al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (&):
'The people are saying that you want to become caliph.' He said:
'The Arabs were under my control; they would fight whomever I
declared war on and would be peaceful towards whomever I made
peace with, but I gave it up, seeking the countenance of AUah and so
as to spare the blood of the Ummah of Muhammad (&)."'"28

3.12.3. The words of al-Husayn ibn 'Ali (&)
Al-Husayn used to say concerning the Shia of Iraq, who wrote
to him promising him support, then scattered and handed him over to
his enemies: "0 Allah, the people of Iraq deceived me and betrayed
me, and they did to my brother what they did. 0 Allah, bring doom to
them and do not let any one of them escape Your punishment.,,1129
The outcome of their treachery and abandonment of him was his

with him who were of Ah1 al-Bayt, after those @aitorsscattered and
left him. His killing (&) was a great shame and a serious calamity
that would break the heart of every ~ u s l i m . " ' ~

3.12.4. The words of 'Ali ibn al-Husayn
(may Allah have mercy on him)
It is proven that 'Ali ibn al-Husayn said: "0 people of Iraq,
love us as Muslims. Do not love us as idols, for the way you love us
has become so bad that it is something we are ashamed of."1131It is
narrated that a group from Lraq came to him and spoke badly of Abu
Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmh (may AUah be pleased with them). When
they had finished speaking, he said to them: "Can you tell me, are
you (the poor emigrants, who were expelled from their homes and
their property, seeking Bounties from Allah and to please Him, and
helping Allah [i.e. helping His religion - Islamic Monotheism] and
His Messenger [Muhammad]. Such are indeed the truthful [to what
they say]) (Qur'an 59: 8)?" They said: "No."
He said: "Are you *those who, before them, had homes [in
Madinah] and had adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to
them, and have no jealousy in their hearts for that which they have
been given, and give them [emigrants] preference over themselves
even though they were in need of that. And whosoever is saved from
his own covetousness, such are they who will be the successfulb
(Qur'an 59: 9)?' They said: "No."
He said: ''I bear witness that you are not among those of whom
Allah (&) said: (And those who came after them say: 'Our Lord!
Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put
not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our

3.12.5. The words of Muhammad
ibn 'Ali (al-Bsqir)
It was narrated from Muhammad ibn 'Ali (may Allah have
mercy on him) that he said: "Banu Fitimah (the sons of F2timah) are
unanimously agreed on saying the best words concerning Abu Bakr
and mar.""^^ It was also narrated that he said to J2bir alJaCfi:"0
Jzbir, I heard that some people in Iraq are claiming that they love us,
and they impugn Abu Bakr and 'Umar and claim that I am telling
them to do so. Tell them from me that I disavow them before Allah
(&). By the One in Whose hand is the soul of Muhammad, if I were
to be appointed to a position of authority, I would seek to draw close
to Allah (%) by executing them. May I never attain the intercession
of Muhammad (g)
if I do not seek forgiveness for them (Abu Bakr
and 'Umar) and pray for mercy for them. The enemies of Allah
are not aware of their virtue. So tell them that I disavow them and
anyone else who shuns Abu Bakr and 'Umar (may Allah be pleased
with them)."

(s)

It was narrated that B a s s h as-Sayrafi asked Abu Ja'far about
Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and he said: "By Allah, I love them and pray
for forgiveness for them; I never met anyone of Ah1 al-Bayt who did
not love them.""35

3.12.6. The words of Zayd ibn 'Ali
(may Allah have mercy on him)
It was narrated that Zayd ibn 'Ali said: "Abu Bakr was the
leader of those who are grateful." Then he recited the verse: (And
Allah will give reward to those who are grateful.) (Qur'an 3: 144)
Then he said: "Disavowing Abn Bakr is disavowing ' ~ l i (may

you wish, refrain. rr1137

3.12.7. The words of Ja'far ibn
Muhammad (as-Ssdiq)
It was narrated from 'Abdul-Jabb2 ibn 'Abbgs al-Hamadini
that Ja'far ibn Muhammad came to them when they wanted to leave
Madinah and said: "If Allah wills, you are among the righteous of
your city. Convey the message from me that whoever claims that I
am an infallible Imam to whom obedience is obligatory, I disavow
him.1138Whoever claims that I disavow Abn Bakr and 'Umar, I
disavow him." It was narrated from S%m ibn Abdullah ibn 'Umar
that Ja'far said to him: "0 Saim, love them and disavow those who
hate them, for they were leaders of guidance." Then Ja'far said:
"Would a man impugn his grandfather? Ahu Bakr is my grandfather.
May I never attain the intercession of Muhammad (g)
on the Day of
Resurrection if I do not love them both and disavow those who hate
them.,, 1139 It was also narrated from Ja'far ihn Muhammad that he
used to say: "Every time I hope for 'Ali's intercession for me, I also
hope for the intercession of Abn B&r, for he fathered me twice
[because the lineage of both of his parents went back to Ahu
~akr]."
It was narrated that he (may Allah have mercy on him) was
asked about Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and he said: "You are asking me

narrated from him that he said: "May Allah disavow anyone who

commenting on this report: "I say: These words are narrated in
mntawitir reports from Ja'far as-Sidiq; I swear by Allah that he was
sincere in what he said and not hypocritical to anyone, may Allah
(g)
doom the Rzfidis.9,1143
These are the views of the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt, the good and
pure ones, whom the R2iifidi Shia claim as their Imams and claim to
love and support, and to whom they attribute their beliefs. This

584

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

illustrates and clarifies their stance against the Rifidi Shia and their
religion, and their disavowal of them and their corrupt deeds and
beliefs, including their slandering the best of the Companions and the
Mothers of the Believers (may Allah be pleased with them all). These
statements of Ah1 al-Bayt prove that they had the same beliefs as Ah1
as-Sunnah, both outwardly and inwardly, concerning both major and
minor issues. These were the beliefs that they followed, on the basis
of which they regarded some as friends and some as enemies. The
one who attributes anything other than that to them is lying about
them and transgressing against them. May AUah (&) bestow His
abundant mercy upon them and may Allah (s)
humiliate those who
attribute lies to them.""

3.13. Stance concerning the idea of rapprochement
between Ahl as-Sunnah and the Shia
From the discussion above, we can clearly see the extent to
which the Rifi@ Shia have been misguided, have introduced
innovations and have gone astray from the Book of Allah, the
Sunnah of His Messenger and the way of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs. We can understand the full extent of the danger and harm
contained in their main reference. books in the fields of Qur'an
interpretation, tawheed, hadiths and others. We can also see the harm
done to the Muslims from merely accepting and recognising these
books that are full of misinformation reaching a level that even the
plots of the Orientalists and missionaries did not reach in attempting
to change the religion of Allah (&) and its laws in the name of Islam.
In fact, the Orientalists and missionaries relied on these books, and
on the specious arguments and myths they contain, to conspire
against Islam and the Muslims. This is why there is a strong
resemblance, if not total uniformity, between the specious arguments
of the orientalists and missionaries and the views of the RSfidi Shia.

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

585

This is nothing new, and this relationship deserves to be
studied on its own in dedicated academic research. A long time ago,
our enemies relied on the opinions of the RiXifidi Shia and used them
as a platform from which to fight Islam and its people. The R2fidi
Shiite troops were the best weapon at the enemy's disposal, and
RZfidi Shiism became a refuge for everyone who wanted to destroy
Islam, including the heretics, the resentful and those who sought
vengeance. History is tilled with their conspiracies, betrayal and
support for the enemy. One of the main reasons for this is that the
R Z d i Shia do not believe in the legitimacy of any Muslim
government except the government of the awaited mahdi, who has
been absent for more than eleven centuries; hence the enemy was
able to find its way into their hearts through this route.1145
Ibn Taymiyah said: "Many of them had a greater inclination
towards the disbelievers than towards the Muslims. Hence when the
disbelieving Turks came out of the East and killed the Muslims,
shedding their blood in Khorasan, Iraq, Syria, Mesopotamia and
elsewhere, the R2fi&s helped them against the Muslims. Similarly, in
Damascus, Aleppo and elsewhere, some of the R2fifidis were among
those who offered the greatest help to them in fighting the Muslims.
Then when the Christians (the Crusaders) fought the Muslims in
Syria, the R%i& were the greatest help to them. They always
befriend the disbelievers, polytheists and Christians, helping them
fight the Muslims and transgress against them. 1,1146 Historical
evidence is sufficient to c o n f m that, such as the following:

3.13.1. The conspiracy of the Rsfidi Ibn al-'Alqami
to bring about the fall of Baghdad in 656 AH''^^
In brief, Ibn al-'Alqami was the adviser of the Abbasid caliph
al-Musta'sim. The caliph followed the madh-hab of AN as-Sunnah,
as his father and grandfather had, but be was too lenient and not alert.

586

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

This RZdi adviser was planning to destroy the caliph's state,
annihilate the Sunnis, and then establish a state on the basis of the
R S d i Shiite madh-hab. He took advantage of his position and the
heedlessness of the caliph to cany out his conspiracy against the
caliphate. The conspiracy consisted of three stages:
(a) Weakening the army and putting pressure on the people by
trying to stop the salaries of the Muslim troops. Ibn Katheer said:
'The vizier Ibn al-'Alqami tried to dismiss the troops and erase
their names from the records. The number of troops at the end of
al-Mustansir's reign was nearly one hundred thousand, but Ibn
al-'Alqami kept trying to reduce their number until there were
only ten thousand left."i148
(b) Corresponding with the Tatars. Ibn Katheer (may Allah have
mercy on him) said: 'Then he wrote to the Tatars and
encouraged them to attack the counhy, telling them that it would
be easy and informing them of the real situation of the state and
its weakness.""49

(c) Forbidding the people from fighting and deceiving the caliph.
~~
He prohibited the common folk from fighting the ~ a t a r s , "and
he gave the caliph and his court the impression that the king of
the Tatm wanted to make a peace deal with them. He suggested
to the caliph that he should go out and stand before the king so
that a peace deal could be signed on the basis that half of the
produce of Iraq would be theirs, and the other half would be for
the caliph. The caliph went out to meet him with seven hundred
riders from among the judges, jurists, commanders and
prominent people. This trick resulted in the killing of the caliph
and the leaders and elite of the Umrnah who accompanied him,
without requiring any effoa on the part of the Tatars.
Those R S d i Shia - or rather, hypocrites - suggested to
Hulagu that he should not make a peace deal with the caliph. The

'Ali ibn Abi Tlilib

587

vizier Ibn d-'Alqami said to him: "If you sign a peace deal on the
basis that you will have half of the produce, it will only last for one or
two years, then things will go hack to the way they were." He
encouraged him to kill the caliph, although it was said that the
suggestion to kill the caliph came from both the vizier Ibn al- 'Alqami
and Nqeer at-~oosi."~'The Tatars attacked the city and killed
everyone they could -men, women, old people, middle aged people
and young people. No one was spared except the dhimmis -the Jews
and Christians - and those who sought refbge with them or in the
house of the vizier. the R2fiifidiIbn d-'Alqami. It was said that they
killed more than ten million Muslims, more or less"52; Islam had
never seen a massacre like this one that was carried out by the
disbeliever Turkic armies, who were called the Tatars. They killed the
H2shimis and captured the women, Ahbasids and others. Could he he
a lover of Ah1 al-Bayt, the one who sent the disbelievers to kill them
and capture their women and to do the same to all the ~ u s l i r n s ? " ~ ~
Hulagu and his fighters killed the imams who led the prayers,
those who gave the sermons and those who had memorised the
Qur'an. The mosques ceased to function, and there were no
congregational prayers in Baghdad for several
Ibn al-'Alqami's aims were to eradicate the Sunnah altogether
so that the Rsifidiinnovation could prevail, and to build a huge school
for the RZdis, where they could spread their madh-hah. However,
Allah (%) did not enable him to do that; He withdrew His blessings
from him and caused him to die a few months after that incident, and
He caused his son to follow him in death.'lS5

3.13.2. The Safavid state
In the Safavid state, which was founded by Shah Ism?i'eel asSafawi, the RZfidi madh-hah was imposed on the Persians hy force
and was made the official mad-hah. Ism?i'eel was hard-hearted and

588

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

bloodthirsty to a degree than can hardly be imagined."56 He
propagated the idea that he was infallible, with no distance between
him and the Mahdi, and he said that he did not do anything that he
was not instructed to do by the twelve 11nams.~~~'
He carried his
sword and wielded it against Ah1 as-Sunnah, and he used the reviling
of the three (Rightly Guided) caliphs as a means of testing the
Persians. This Shah issued orders that they (the caliphs) be reviled
openly, in the streets and marketplaces and on the minbars, and he
warned that those who refused would be beheaded. When he
conquered a city, he would impose Rsfidism on its inhabitants by
force of arms.1158
The RZ@ shaykhs supported the Safavid rulers in taking
Shiism to further stages of extremism. They imposed that on the
Muslims of Persia by force of iron and fire. One of the most
prominent of these shaykhs was their shaykh 'Ali a l - ~ a r k i , " ~ ~
whom the Shia call al-Muhaqqiq ath-Thini. Shah TahmLib, the son
of Shah Ismii'eel, kept him close to him and gave him power and
authority in the state. Similarly, al-Majlisi was one of the shaykhs of
the Safavid state who played a role alongside the political authorities
in influencing the Muslims in Persia, to such an extent that it was said
that his book Haqq nl-Yaqeen was a reason for seventy thousand
Persian Sunnis becoming ~hiites."~' It is likely that this is an
exaggeration on the pa~Tof the Shia, because R&di idem had not
been able to find any place in Persia except through force and terror,
not through thought and c o n ~ i c t i o n . " ~ ~
We should not forget the other impacts of the Safavid state,
which were its wars against the state of the Ottoman Islamic
caliphate, its cooperation with the Portnguese and English enemies
against the Muslims, and its encouraging them to build churches and
bring in missionaries and priests, while fighting the Sunnah and its
fo~owers."~~

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

These are some of the actions of their state and their
individuals in this field. Among the immortal words and important
comments of Ibn Taymiyah in this regard, which will be recognised
as being true if you apply them in reality and try to study events of
history in the light of his words, are: "Let every wise man look at
what is happening in his own time, and in the era that is close to his
time, of turmoil, evil and corruption among the Muslims; he will find
that most of that is caused by the R s d i s . Yon will find them to be
among the most evil of people; they never give up doing what they
can to cause turmoil and evil and to spread corruption among this
~ m m a h . " We
~ ~ have learned by direct experience and through
c o n k e d mutawitir reports that the greatest turmoil and evil,
without parallel, comes only from them."1164
With whom should we unite, 0 Ah1 as-Sunnah? With those
who undermine our Qnr'an, interpret it in a way other than what it
means, and distort its meanings? With those who regard as
disbelievers Abu Bakr and 'Umar, as well as the Mother of the
Believers, the dearest of the Prophet's wives to him, 'A'ishah (I&),
and also Talhah, az-Zubayr and others among the most prorni&ut
Companions (A)?
With those who try to deceive the Muslims in the
name of taqiyyah?1165

3.13.3. Contemporary experiences
with regard to rapprochement
3.13.3.a. The experience of Mustafa as-Sib3

Dr. Muvtafa as-Sibz'i, along with some of the Shiite scholars,
put a great deal of effort into addressing the issue of rapprochement.
He hied to hold an Islamic conference to study the best way of laying
down foundations for harmony, love and rapprochementbetween the
two groups. He thought that one of the greatest factors in coming
together would he for the scholars of the two groups to visit one

590

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shia

another and publish books calling for rapprochement, and he thought
that no one should publish books that might provoke the other side.
Dr. as-Sibii'i visited one of the senior religious authorities of the Shia,
their shaykh 'Abdul-Husayn Sharaf ad-Deen al-Moosawi, whom
they regard as one of the greatest proponents of Islamic unity and
rapprochement between sects. He found him to be enthusiastic about
this idea and a great believer in it, and they agreed to bold an Islamic
conference between Sunni and Shiite scholars for this purpose.
As-Sibg'i (may Allah have mercy on him) also visited
prominent Shiites, such as politicians, businessmen and literary
experts, for the same purpose, and he came away very pleased with
the results of these contacts. He never realised what aims these
people were hiding and what plans they were seeking to achieve on
the basis of the call for rapprochement. Then suddenly -as as-Sibg'i
desaibed it - shortly after that, this same al-Moosawi, who had
been very enthusiastic about rapprochement, published a book about
Abu Hurayrah (&) which was full of slanders and insults; in fact, it
concluded that Abu Hurayrah (&) was a hypocrite and a
disbeliever, and that the Messenger (g)
told him that he was one of
the people of ~ e 1 1 . " ~ ~
As-Sibii'i said: "I was astounded by the attitude of 'AbdulHnsayn in both his words and his book, this attitude that does not
indicate any sincere desire for rapprochement and forgetting the
past.""67 As-Sibii'i stated that the only thing the Shiite shaykhs
offered to contribute to the idea of rapprochement was some flattery
and smooth talk in conferences and gatherings, while many of them
continued to revile the Companions, think badly of them and believe
all such reports that were narrated in the books of their
predecessors.1i68He stated that while they were propagating the idea
of coming together, this had no impact on the Shiite scholars in Iraq
and Iran. These people were still insisting on what their books

'Ali ibn Abi Ta*lib

591

contain of serious criticism and distorted interpretations of the
differences that arose among the Companions, as if the aim behind
this call for rapprochement was for Ah1 as-Sunnah to draw close to
the Shiite madh-hah.1169
As-Sibi'i states that with regard to any academic research
about the history of the Snnnis, or other Muslim sects that do not
agree with the S h i i point of view, some of their scholars denounced
the one who did that research, on the basis of the call for
rapprochement. They accused the author of this research of being a
fanatic who was putting obstacles in the way of those who seek to
bring about rapprochement. However, when it comes to a hook like
that of 'Ahdul-Husayn Sharaf ad-Deen, which slanders one of the
greatest Companions, whose reports of hadith are regarded as most
authentic by Ah1 as-Sunnah, these critics and angry people do not
regard that as an action that hinders the efforts of those who are
striving for rapprochement.
He says: "I am not saying that this book about Abu Hurayrah is
the only book. There are hooks being printed in Iraq and lran which
contain condemnation of the majority of the Companions, which no
human being with any conscience or dignity could bear to hear, and
which fan the flames of division anew." "70 This was the experience
of Shaykh as-Sib2'i; his attempt failed in the face of the fanaticism of
the Shiite shaykhs and their insistence on enmity against the best
generation, who lived during the best era.""
To the R%i& Shia, rapprochement means giving them the
opportunity to spread their beliefs in Sunni countries and continue to
while the
slander the Companions of the Messenger of Allah
Sunnis keep quiet and refrain from stating the truth. If the RZfidis
hear the truth being propagated, they get angry and start ranting that
unity is in danger."72

3.13.2.b. The experience of
Shaykh Moosa Jsrullah
This noble scholar, whose full name was Moosa ihn J2rnllah
at-Turkisthi d-Q2z2niar-RRoo, was the senior shaykh of Russia at
the end of the Czarist period and the beginning of the Soviet period.
He had ultimate authority over the affairs of Russian Muslims, who
numbered more than thirty million. Then came the storm of
communism, and he ended up far away from his countq and his
people. He wrote a number of essays and hooks, and he travelled in
India, the Hijaz, Egypt and Iraq. He said of himself: "I could have
attained the position of being the foremost Russian writer and one of
the pioneers and leaders, if I had given up my faith, hut I preferred to
sell this world for the i~ereafter.""'~
This noble shaykh put a great deal of effort into trying to unite
the Ummah and to bring Sunni and Shiite together. He started by
studying the books of the Shia, studying them with great interest, as
he said. He studied Utool al-Krifi wa Furoo 'uhu, Man la yahduruhu
al-Faqeeh, al-Wrifi, Mar'dt al-'Uqool, Bihrir al-Anwrir, Ghriyat alMardm and many other books.1174Then he visited Shiite lands and
lived among the Shia for more than seven months, visiting their
places of worship, shrines and schools, and attending their gatherings
and special occasions, both feasts and gatherings for mourning the
dead. He attended circles of knowledge in houses, in mosques and
their courtyards, and in schools. He stayed in Najaf during Muharram
and saw everything that the Shia do during the days of mourning and
on the day of 'Ashoora (the tenth day of the month of Muharram,
when the Shia commemorate the martyrdom of al-Husayn in 61 AH).
The academic conclusion that this scholar reached, based on his deep
insight and abundant knowledge, was that refuting the beliefs and
practices of the Shia was the first step towards bringing the Ummah
together, and that it could not happen without that.

'Ali ibn Abi Tirlib

593

His first step towards rapprochement was to meet the Shaykh
of the Shia, M&sin at-Ameen, in Tehran. They spoke for a while,
then Shaykh Moosa gave him a small piece of paper, dated 16 August
1934;he sent one copy of it to the scholars of Najaf and another copy
to the scholars of al-Kadhimiyyah.
What was written on the paper
was: "I present these issues to the scholars of noble Najaf with all
respect, in the hope of achieving some benefits with a sincere heart,
aiming to bring together the two worlds of Islam, 'the Imami group
that is in the
(according to their claim) and Ah1 asSunnah
waldami'ah, hoping that the scholars will respond, altogether or one
by one, each with a full explanation and his signature, coni'irmed with
his seal."
In the letter, he then mentioned a number of reprehensible
matters that appear in the books of the Shia, quoting page numbers
for everything he mentioned. He listed a number of serious issues in
the books of the R Z d i Sbia which were preventing the Ummah from
uniting, such as:
*

Regarding the Companions as disbelievers.

+*: Cursing the first generation of Muslims.
+*: Believing that the noble Qur'an has been tampered with.
*:

Regarding all the governments of Islamic states
throughout the ages, and their judges and scholars, as
evil oppressors.

-3 Regarding all Islamic groups except the Shia as
disbelievers who are cursed and will abide forever in Hell.
-3 Holding the views that jihad alongside anyone but the
Imam (ruler) whom it is obligatory to obey is as h a r b as
eating dead meat or pork, and that there is no martyr
except in the case of the Shia. (The Shiite is a martyr even
if he dies in his own bed, but anyone other than the Shia

594

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

who fights for the sake of Allah is hastening towards
Hellfire.)
After quoting the evidence for these issues from the major
reference books of the Shia, Shaykh Moosa said, addressing the
Shiite shaykhs: "These are six issues in which the Shia believe
strongly. Is there any hope left for uniting the Muslims when this is
the belief of the Shia? After listing all these issues and beliefs, will
the word of unity have any impact on the h e m of those who believe
that? Is it possible for Islam to prevail in Muslim nations who hold
such beliefs?"
He went on to list other blameworthy matters, such as:
+*: The Shia's rejection of the hadiths and reports of the
Ummah, and their claim that everything that goes against
the way of the Umrnah is guidance. He thought that this
principle in itself would lead to the destruction of the
Shiite religion before it destroyed Islam.

-3 In the hooks of the Shia, there are references to verses and
soorahs that were revealed concerning the Imams and the
Shia, and verses and soorahs that were revealed
concerning the disbelief of Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and of
those who follow them.
+:* The Shia's going to extremes with regard to taqiyyah.
Then he mentioned other reprehensible falsehoods in the
books of the Shia, such as:
Allah (s)divorced
'A'ishah and she ceased to be one of the Mothers of the
Believers.

- The idea that the Messenger of

The idea that when the Mahdi emerges, he will carry out
the hadd punishment on 'A'ishah, avenging his mother
Fitimah (I&,), the daughter of the Prophet (g).

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

595

The idea that when the Mahdi appears, he will destroy the
mosques of Islam.
Then he stated that the spirit of the Shiite religion is a spirit of
enmity, and that the books of the Shia contain stories of enmity
between Ahu Bakr and 'Umar; he asserted that all of that is
fabricated.
He mentioned that the books of the Shia quote one of the
Imams as saying: "Even if the Ummah is at a high level of sincerity,
honesty and decency, it cannot be regarded as believing because it
denies imamate." Even though the Shia do not have anything of
religion, they are not to be blamed because they believe in the
imamate of a fair and just Imam.
He mentioned some other issues, then he said: "0 respected
scholars, come and tell me what you think should he done so that
Islam and the Muslims can be united around the Book of Allah."
What was the answer of the Shia to the matters that he quoted
from their main reference books, hoping for clarification and in
accordance with the command of Allah (%) in His Book: BSo ask of
those who know the Scripture [learned men], if you know not#
(Qur'an 16: 43); (Qur'an 21: 7)? Shaykh Moosa said: "Then I waited
for more than a year, and I did not hear any answer from anyone
except the senior Shia person qualified to exercise ijtihsd in Basra.
He carried out his duty and was kind enough to answer all questions
in a letter of more than ninety pages, using words of slander with
regard to the first generation that were worse than the words in the
books of the Shia."
After he did not receive any other response from the Shiite
shaykhs, Shaykh Moosa wrote his book al-Washee'ah j? Naqd
'Aqh'id ash-Shia.He said: "I am defending the honour and sanctity
of Islam and fulfilling my duties towards the first generation that are
due to them from me and from the entire ~mmah.""'~

596

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

While Shaykh Moosa J h l l a h thought that the effort he put
into writing and publishing his book al-Washee 'ah and advising the
Shiite shaykhs would be the first step towards rapprochement and
bringing Muslims together, the Shiite shaykhs thought that what
Shaykh Moosa revealed must be hidden, and this exposure angered
them a great deal. The reason for their becoming angry at the
exposure of the falsehoods contained in their books is that this was
also an exposure of their ulterior motives and personal aims. It
uncovered their exploitation of the ordinary Shiite fok, in religious
matters by claiming to be the deputies of the awaited infallible one,
and in financial matters in the name of the one-fifth that is due to the
awaited ~ a h d i . " ~ ~

3.13.4. The proper method for
rapprochement and unity
The proper way to bring about rapprochement and unity is for
the Sunni scholars to put a great deal of effort into:
spreading their sound beliefs, which are based on the Book
of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (g);
*

explaining the soundness of these views and how they are
distinct from the madh-habs of the followers of
innovation;

*:*

exposing the conspiracies and lies of the R%idi Shia and
quoting evidence for that from the books of Ahl asSunnah; and

03 refuting, on the basis of knowledge, justice and proof, the
specious arguments that are aimed at Ah1 as-Sunnah.
It is essential that this be accompanied by an explanation of the
deviant ways of the R%i@ Shia and an exposure of their misguidance
and corrnpt basic beliefs. Even though the Sunni scholars have

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

597

already done some of that, they have to redouble their efforts. Those
efforts should be planned, and they should work collectively.
The proper way to achieve unity is to explain the truth and
expose the falsehood, in order to bring the Shia close to the Book of
Allah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah and a correct
understanding of Islam. This is best accomplished through the words
of the scholars of Ahl as-Sunnah, foremost among whom are the
jurists and scholars of Ah1 d-Bayt, such as Amir d-Mu'mineen 'Ali
and his sons and grandsons. We have to stand up to this wave of
R%& propaganda of which the pure Ahl al-Bayt would be ashamed
and which is very active today in the Muslim world and in Europe
and America, so that the Muslims can unite on a word that is just and
can hold fast, all together, to the rope of Allah (the Qur'an) and not be
divided among them~elves."'~
With some of the Shiite scholars, it may seem pointless to
present evidence from the Qur'an, Sunnah and scholarly consensus,
and to demonstrate to them the flaws in their fundamentals that are
contrary to the views of Ah1 as-Suunah. However, that does not mean
that we should stop explaining the view of Ah1 as-Sunnah and its
soundness, and comparing it with the misguidance and invalidity of
the Shiite madh-hab with regard to these fundamentals. That will put
a limit on the spread of Ritidi beliefs among Ah1 as-Sunnah, by
Allah's leave.
We have to discuss that which exposes their falsehood from
their own books. This methodology was not followed by earlier
scholars who were keen to refute the RZ&s, expose the flaws of
their arguments and refute their claims. Perhaps the reason for that is
that the books of these people were not widely available because they
were only circulated among themselves, or it may be that some of
their main reference books were fabricated by later scholars and
attributed to their earlier scholars, or that material was added to these

598

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

books in later times (particularly during the era of the Safavid state).
Whatever the reason, the books of the RififiClis today are widely
circulated. Many of the Rifi& Shia believe in their sanctity and
soundness, so they do not believe or accept anything except what is
in them; as a result, they reject not only the sound Sunnah but even
the clear texts of the Qur'an. Some of them even believe the myths
that undermine the Book of AUah and claim that the Imams received
revelation and had knowledge of the unseen. Therefore we should try
to correct and reform the Shia on the basis of their own books,
exposing their misguidance through their own reports. The starting
point for rapprochement may be their own books.1179
Some efforts have already been made in this field, and some
books have appeared, such as: al-Imrimahwan-Najs by Faysal Noor,
Thumma Absartul-Haqeeqah by Muhammad ibn 'Ali al-Qif^ari, and
DirLisah 'an al-Firaq wa Tareekh al-Muslimeen by Dr. &mad Jilli.
This method must be developed in a very careful manner, though,
because the reader of the Shiite books may find some white threads in
the midst of a huge accumulation of misguidance, and it will then he
possible to weave from these threads the sound belief of the Imams,
which is in accordance with the Qur'an and sound Sunnah; that could
save them from the loss and misguidance in which they are living.
Just as these threads have to do with fundamental matters, they d s o
have to do with minor issues. It is on this basis that rapprochement is
possible.1180
It is also important to point out and encourage sincere Shiite
voices who are calling for reform, and to respect them and stand with
them in advising their people, as has been done by asSayyid Husayn
d-Moosawi (may Allah have mercy on him) in his book Lillrihi
thumrna lit-Tareekh: Kashf al-AsrLirji Tabri'at al-A'immah al-Athdr,
and by d-Sayyid m a d Kitib in his book Tatawwur al-Fikr asSiyrisi ash-Shiite min ash-Shoora ila Wilriyat al-Faqeeh. We have to

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

599

stand with everyone who sincerely loves Ahl al-Bayt, following the
guidance in the reports that are soundly attributed to them and their
beautiful teaching in guiding people to the Book of Allah and the
Sunnah of His Prophet (@).
We should treat these people with all due respect and lead
them to the safe shore; we should explain the noble Qur'an to them
according to the rules of the Arabic language, without twisting or
distorting anything; and we should refer understanding of the Sunnah
to trustworthy scholars.1181The view of any person except the
infallible Prophet (g)
may he accepted or rejected. Whatever is
narrated from the early generations that is accordance with the
Qur'an and Sunnah, we accept it; otherwise, the Book of Allah and
the Sunnah of His Messenger are more deserving of being followed.
We do not criticise or undermine anyone with regard to the issues in
which they differed and disputed, they have all passed away, and it is
for AUah (%) to judge them.118z
Every innovation that has been introduced into the religion of
Islam for which there is no basis, and which people adopt on the basis
of their whims and desires - whether it is something that has been
added or taken away - is misguidance; it must he opposed1183and
stopped using the best means that do not lead to something worse.
Loving and respecting the righteous, and praising them for what is
known of their good deeds, is something by means of which one may
draw close to Allah (B).
The close friends of Allah (&) are those
who are mentioned in this verse: dThose who believed, and used to
fear Allah much [by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing
righteous deeds]) (Qur'an 10: 63). Due respect for them is confirmed
on the basis of the Sharia conditions, hut they did not possess any
power to bring benefit or harm to themselves, either while they were
alive or after their death, let alone to anyone else."84

600

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharfjites and Shia

Visiting graves of any type is something that is prescribed in
Islam, as long as it is done in the manner mentioned in the reports.
However, seeking help from those who are buried or asking to have
one's needs met by them, whether one is close to the grave or not,
making vows to them, building structures over or screens around
their graves, touching them for blessing, swearing by someone other
than Allah (g),
and other similar innovations, are major sins that
must be opposed so as to block the way that may lead to polytheism;
we should not justify these actions.'185
The fact that a wrong action is customruy does not affect its
rnlings according to Sharia; it is essential to properly understand
these Sharia rulings and adhere to them. We should beware of being
deceived by names; we must look at the objects themselves, whether
in religious or worldly affairs. What matters is the objects, not the
names."86 Islam frees the mind and encourages us to ponder the
universe, raise the status of knowledge and of scholars, and welcome
anything that is good and beneficial. Wisdom is the lost property of
the believer wherever he finds it, and he is the most entitled of all
people to it."87 We do not regard as a disbeliever - because of any
opinion or sin - any Muslim who affirms the twin declarations of
faith, acts in accordance with their meanings and does the obligatory
duties, unless he does one of the following: speaks words of disbelief,
rejects something that is well established and known in Islam, rejects
a clear text of the Qur'an, interprets the Qur'an in a way that cannot
be understood on the basis of the Arabic language at all, or does
something that cannot be interpreted in any way except as
disbelief.1188
These principles and concepts help people in general to
understand Islam as it is embodied in the Book of Allah, the Sunnah
of His Messenger (8)
and the way of Ah1 as-Sunnab wal-Jamg'ah,
the foundations of which were laid down by the Messenger of Allah

Xli ibn Abi Tiilib

601

(g),
the Rightly Guided Caliphs and those scholars and jurists who
followed their way.
The followers of truth who adhere to the way of Ah1 as-Sunnah
have no innovations, praise be to Allah
Their reference points
are the Qur'an and the sound Sunnah, and they cannot give up
anything of that because they cannot compromise on issues of
religion. As for the Rsfifidi Shia, they take part in a great deal of
innovation. Nothing prevents them from giving it up except blind
fanaticism, following whims and desires, and the materialistic
interests of some of their shaykhs who deviated from the guidance of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali and the scholars of Ah1 al-Bayt (may All;&
be pleased with them all).

(s).

The scholars stated that Ahl asSunnah should denounce the
innovation of the innovators, even if the person is doing it as an act of
worship, believing it to be correct. Nevertheless, we should limit our
denunciation of these innovations by evaluating the pros and cons. It
may be better to put up with some lesser evil caused by innovation in
order to ward off a greater evil, or to miss out on some lesser benefit
in order to attain a greater benefit, and this is a sound principle
according to the jurists. Following this principle might cause us to
refrain from denouncing the innovation of the Rifidi Shia at certain
times or in ceaain places, so as to prevent bad consequences, as when
condemnation would stir up trouble and lead to bloodshed and
fighting among the people of a counhy where Shiites and Sunnis are
equal in number. In normal situations, though, where no bad
consequences are expected from this denunciation, it is appropriate
and may be obligatory.1i89
The Sunni scholars have to adhere to a calm, academic style
when discussing innovations, and they should be gentle towards the
innovators. Part of being gentle may include visiting them and
cooperating with them in matters concerning which there is no

602

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

dispute, or helping them at times of calamities and difficulties, or
supporting them when there is a conflict with a disbeliever or
oppressor, in accordance with Sharia guidelines and after weighing
the pros and cons. The idea of cooperating, maintaining good
relations and discussing calmly cannot be applied across the board to
include those R2fifidi Shia who have extreme views, where keeping
quiet about them may provoke the thugs and troublemakers. Instead,
we must denounce those who hold extreme and odd views at all
times.
The line that is drawn between the first category, to whom we
should speak kindly, and the second category, to whom we should
speak harshly, depends on whether the one who holds a particular
view is relying on a Sharia text that may be causing him some
confusion or is relying on an interpretation that some people may
favour. In the case of those who base their arguments on reports
narrated by unknown narrators or narrators of later generations, and
those who do not even base their view on the misinterpretation of
some reports, denunciation is more appropriate, and speaking harshly
to them may be obligatory.1190
In sectarian societies, the decision-makers among the Sunnis
are the ones who are able to evaluate the political situation and party
alliances with other sects and analyse the pros and cons, according to
the guidelines of Islamic teachings. This does not mean that the
scholars and the callers to Islam should not teach the Muslims the
basics of the way of Ah1 as-Sunnah or warn against the deviant
beliefs that are infiltrating Muslim societies. This is necessaq so that
they will not be influenced by those cormpt ideas, whose proponents
are striving tirelessly to spread them night and day, secretly and
openly. When the Messenger of Allah (@) migrated to Madinah, he
made peace deals with the Jews that guaranteed them a life of dignity
under the Islamic state, yet at the same time the noble Qur'an was

'AIi ibn Abi Tilib

603

discussing the beliefs, history and morals of the Jews so that the
Muslims might know their real character and not be deceived by
them.

4. The last days of the life of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (&)
and his martyrdom
4.1. The aftermath of Nahrawsn
The fact that Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (L&) fought this
rebellious group offers strong evidence and clear proof that he was in
the right when he fought the people of Syria and that he was closer to
the truth than MuC2wiyah.It was narrated from the Messenger of
Allah (@) that he said: "A group will secede from my Ummah at a
time of division among the Muslims, and they will be killed by the
group that is closer to the truth."1191 The reader might expect the
army to have strong resolve in fighting the people of Syria after this
and the other proofs mentioned above, such as the killing of 'Amm%
ibn Y2sir (&), became clear to them. However, the opposite
happened.
The plan that was drawn up by Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&,)
was to go to Syria after the end of fighting against the Kharijites,
because bringing Syria under the control of the caliphate and uniting
the Ummah was a necessary goal that had to be pursued. As he
mentioned in his speech, fighting the Khaijites was only aimed at
securing the interior front lest they attack the women and children left
behind in Iraq during his absence. But as they say, the winds blow in
a way other than what the sailors want, and 'Ali (&) was unable to
attack Syria before he was martyred.1192

604

Xli's anitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

The rebellion of the Kharijites had the effect of weakening the
army of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&). The battles of the Camel,
Siffeen and NaJuawin also led the people of Iraq to grow tired of war.
They grew reluctant and started hating war, especially after the battle
with the Syrians at Siffeen, because their conflict with them was not
like fighting with anyone else. The battle of Siffeen was fierce and
never left their memory; many children were orphaned, and many
women were widowed, without achieving the goal. Were it not for
the peace deal or arbitration, which was welcomed by Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali and many of his companions, disaster would have
struck the Muslim world with unimaginably bad consequences. Thus
they were very reluctant to march with 'Ali (&) to Syria, even
though they h e w that he was in the
One of the dilemmas that destabilized the camp of Amir alMu'mineen 'Ali (&) was the emergence of a group that went to
extremes in venerating him and elevated him to the level of divinity,
to the extent that some thought that this was a reaction to the
Kharijites who had disavowed 'Ali (&) and accused him of
d i ~ b e l i e f . " ~In~ reality, the ulterior motive of this group was to
introduce corrupt beliefs to the Muslims in order to destroy their
religion and weaken the Muslims in general, not just the army."95
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) stood up to them, as we have seen
above. Undoubtedly the splitting away of the Kharijites and his
subsequent fighting against them weakened his side a great deal, and
then problems came one after another.
Al-Khirreet ibn Rhhid (it was also said that his name was alH i t h ibn Rkhid), who had been one of 'Ali's governors in alAhwiz, revolted and led his people Banu Nzjiyah in rebellion. When
he called for 'Ali (&) to he deposed, many people responded and he
gained control over many cities, even collecting taxes from the
people. 'Ali (&) sent an army led by Ma'qil ibn Qays ar-Rayy&,

'Ali ibn Abi rrilib

605

who defeated and killed the rebel leader.1196Those people who were
paying land tax hoped to stop paying it in the lands under 'Ali's mle,
and the people of al-Ahwk rebelled; 'Ali (&) was inevitably
confronted with military and financial difficulties because of that.
Ash-Shu'bi said: "When 'Ali defeated the people of Nahrawh, many
people went against him, and people in many regions began to turn
against him. Banu Nsjiyah rebelled against him. Ibn al-H&ami
came to Basra, and the people of al-Ahwk rebelled. Those who were
paying the land tax wanted to stop, and they expelled Sahl ibn
Haneef, 'Ali's governor in ~ersia.""'~
At the same time, Mu'iwiyah (&) was trying by all possible
means, both secretly and openly, to weaken the camp of Amir alMu'mineen 'ALi (&), and he took advantage of the division and
troubles that had arisen in 'Ali's army. He sent an army, led by ' A m
ibn d-'As (&), to take control of Egypt and bring it under his
authority. He was helped hy a number of factors, such as:
*:*

Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was preoccupied with the

Kharijites.
*

'Ali's governor in Egypt, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, was
not as clever as his predecessor Qays ibn Sa'd ibn 'Ubidah
as-Sc'idi d-Anski had been. He got involved in fighting
with those who were demanding vengeance for the murder
of 'Uthmin (&), and he did not try to use diplomacy with
them as the previous governor had done, so they defeated
him.

+'

Mn'iwiyah agreed with those who were seeking
vengeance for the murder of 'Uthmh in Egypt, which
helped him to gain control of it.ll'*

*:*

Egypt was far away from the headquarters of Amir alMu'n~ineen 'Ali (4)
and was close to Syria.

606

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia
*+:

The geographical location of Egypt, which was attached to
Syria through the Sinai, meant that it was like a natural
extension of Syria. Egypt gave Mu'iwiyah (&) a great
deal of additional economic strength and human resources.
Mu'iwiyah also sent his troops to Arabia, Makkah,
Madinah and Yemen, but these troops were soon forced to
turn back after Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) sent some of
his soldiers to block their

Mu'iwiyah (&) also hied to win over some prominent hibes
and governors from 'Ali (4).
He tried to convince Qays ibn Sa'd
(&), who was 'Ali's governor in Egypt, to join him but was not able
to. However, he did manage to stir up doubts about him in 'Ali's
inner circle and among his advisers, so 'Mi (&) dismissed
and this dismissal of Sa'd ibn Qays was a huge gain for Mu'iwiyah.
He also tried to win over Ziyid ibn Abeehi, 'Ali's governor in Persia,
but failed to do so.120LHowever, Mu'iwiyah (&) managed to
influence some prominent people and governors because of what he
promised to give them and because they realised that Mu'iwiyah was
gaining the upper hand and 'Ali (&) was growing weaker.

'Ali (&) said in one of his speeches: "Bisr has just come to
me from Mu'iwiyah, and I think these people will prevail over you
because of their unity and support for their falsehood and your
division and lack of support for your truth, because of their obedience
to their leader and your disobedience to your leader; because they are
sincere, and you are treacherous. I appointed so-and-so, but he
betrayed me and took the wealth to MuCiwiy&, I appointed someone
else, and he betrayed me and took the wealth to Mu'iwiyah. Even if I
entrusted one of you with a wooden vessel, I would fear that he
would betray me concerning it. 0 Allah, I hate them, and they hate
me. Relieve them of me, and relieve me of them."'202

4.2. 'Ali's attempts to motivate his army,
then the truce with Mu'gwiyah
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&)
,.
did not give up when faced with
these calamities, this reluctance on the part of his followers and their
letting him down. He did his utmost to motivate his troops with all
that he possessed of knowledge, proof and eloquence. His fiery
speeches, for which he was famous and which are regarded as the best
literary legacy, were not the product of an idle mind or mere
imagination; they were based on bitter experience and the painful
reality that he was living. When some border land under his control
was raided, he said: "Jihad is one of the gates of paradise, which Allah
opens to the closest of His friends. It is the gannent of piety, the shield
of Allah and the greatest protection. Whoever abandons it because of
lack of interest, Allah will give him a garment of humiliation to wear;
calamities will befall him, he will be brought low and a seal will be
placed on his heart. He will be led away from truth because of
neglecting jihad; he will be humiliated and deprived of justice.
"Verily, I called you by night and by day, secretly and openly
to fight these people. I told you to attack them before they attacked
you, for by Allah, no people are attacked in their land but they are
humiliated. But you were negligent and reluctant, so attacks were
launched against you and land was taken from you. Here is a man
from Gh2mid whose troops reached al-Anbk, he killed Hassib alBakri, chased your cavalry from their posts and defeated them. I have
heard that one of them would enter upon a Muslim woman and a
dhimmi woman and take her jewellery, and she could offer no
resistance except weeping and asking for mercy. Then they left
without any harm having befallen them; no man among them was
ever wounded, and none of his blood was shed. If a Muslim man
were to die after that of sorrow for what happened, he would not be to
blame; rather in my eyes that would be appropriate.

608

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

"How strange it is, by Allah, that these people are united in
their falsehood, and you are disunited and do not support your trnth.
This is what breaks the heart and brings grief and sorrow. May yon
perish, for you have become a target to be shot; you are raided and do
not raid others, you are attacked and do not attack others. Allah is
being disobeyed, and yon are pleased with that. If I command you to
march towards them on a hot day, you will say that it is too hot and
we should wait until it cools down. If I command you to march
towards them in winter, you will say that it is too cold and we should
wait until it warms up. All of that in order to avoid heat and cold. If
you are trying to avoid heat and cold, then by Allah yon will try
harder to flee from the sword, 0 you men who are not men. Yon have
the minds of children and are as irrational as women.
'Would that I had never seen you or met you, for knowing
you, by Allah, has caused me great grief and sorrow. May Allah kill
yon, for you have filled my heart with pus and anger, and you have
caused me a great deal of distress. You have spoiled all my plans with
your disobedience and reluctance, to the point that Quraysh have
begun to say that the son of Abu Titlib is a courageous man, but he
has no experience of war. What a strange thing they are saying! Is
there anyone among them with more experience of war than me? Or
who has attained a higher position in it than me? For I got involved in
it when I had not yet reached the age of twenty, and here I am having
passed the age of sixty. But if a man is not obeyed, his wisdom is to
no
This was a fiery speech delivered by Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
(&), in which he heaped criticism on the heads of those people who

had prevented him from reaping the fruits of his jihad and achieving
the victory he strove for. He composed this speech in a sublime
literary style, with phrases that should have stirred people's hearts
and unleashed their potential. It is free of any ambiguity or

Xli ibn Abi Trilib

609

mysteriousness, and it is also free of artificial, far-fetched rhymed
prose. 1204
The speeches that are proven to be from Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (4)
and were delivered during his caliphate not only give a
picture of the historical reality; they also highlight the feelings of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) about the problems he faced with his
army becoming reluctant and slowing down after the Battle of
Nahrawk. However, most of the speeches that are attributed to him
(&) are not sound, and many scholars say that the speeches of 'Ali
(&) that are quoted in Nahj al-Bal6ghah are made up and fabricated
by 'ash-Shareef a r - ~ a & ~ ' . ' ~It" is essential to employ a precise,
critical method when dealing with them as a historical source.

(4)

At the same time, 'Ali
began to remind his companions
of his virtues and his high standing in Islam. A number of
eyewitnesses narrated that 'Ali (&) implored the people at arRabhah: "Who heard the Messenger of Allah (%) say at Ghadeer
Khumm: 'Don't you know that I am closer to the believers than their
own selves?' and they said yes, then he said: 'If I am a person's
mawla, 'Ali is also his mawla. 0 Allah, love those who love him, and
take as an enemy those who take him as an enemy'?" Twelve men or sixteen men, according to another report stood up and testified
to that.lZo6 This reminds us of 'Uthmk's (&) calling on the
Companions to testify to his virtues when the rebels besieged him. It
is as if he was saying: If a person's actions and service to Islam are
like that, should his reward be l i e this?
-

Despite all his tremendous attempts and efforts, 'Ali (&)
could not achieve what he wanted. He could not manage to lead a
campaign to Syria because of the division, friction and disunity that
occurred within his army, and because of the emergence of people
who were controlled by whims and desires. As a result, in 40 AH,
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) was forced to come to an agreement

61 0

1

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

with Mu'iwiyah ibn Abi S u f y k (&), that Lraq would be for 'Ali
and Syria would be for Mu'iwiyah, and that neither would interfere
in the other's sphere of influence by means of any raid or military
campaign.1207At-Tabari said in his book of history: "In 40 AH, there
was a truce between 'Ali and Mu'iwiyah, following a
correspondence between them, which is too lengthy to be quoted
here, about agreeing to put an end to war between them. 'Ali would
have Iraq, and Mu'iwiyah would have Syria, and neither would
interfere in the other's sphere of influence by means of any raid or
military campaign."'208

4.3. The supplication of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali (&) asking that his martyrdom be hastened
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) made a truce with Mu'iwiyah,
but it seems that this truce did not last. Mu'iwiyah sent Bisr ibn Abi
A@
&
'
to the Hijaz in the year in which 'Ali (&) was martyred.1209
When 'Ali (&) was not able to prepare an army as he wanted, and
he saw how they had let him down, he began to hate life and wish for
death. He would turn to Allah (%) in supplication and ask Him
to hasten his death. One of the reports from him says that he delivered
a speech one day in which he said: "0 Allah, I am tired of them, and
they are tired of me. Relieve me of them, and relieve them of me.
What is keeping the most wretched of you from contaminating it with
blood?" And be put his hand on his beard.1210

(s)

'Ali (&) persisted in supplications throughout his final days.
It was nmated that Junduh said: "They crowded around 'Ali (&) so
much that they stepped on his feet, and he said: 'I am tired of them,
and they are tired of me; I hate them, and they hate me. Relieve me of
them, and relieve them of me.""z11 According to another report,
Abu SZh said: "I saw 'Ali place the mu~hafon his head until the
paper crackled, and he said: '0 Allah, I asked them to grant me what

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

61 1

is mentioned in it (the Qur'an), but they refused. 0 Allah, I am tired
of them, and they are tired of me; I hate them, and they hate me. They
have forced me to do things out of character. Give them someone
worse than me, and give me someone better than them. Cause their
hearts to dissolve like salt in water.""212 According to another
report, it was only three days or so before he was killed, may Allah
have mercy on him.1213
Al-Hasan ihn 'Ali said that 'Ali (&) told him: "I dreamt that
the Messenger of Allah (g)
came to me last night, and I said: '0
Messenger of Allah, do you see how much trouble and pain I have
from your Ummah?' He said: 'Pray against them.' I said: '0 Allah,
replace them for me with someone better than them, and replace me
for them with someone worse to them than me."' Al-Hasan (&)
said: "Then he went out, and the man struck him."LZ14

4.4. 'Ali's awareness that he would be martyred
Some hadiths of the Prophet (g),
which are regarded as signs
of his prophethood, narrate that he told 'Ali (&) that he would be
one of the martyrs. In Saheeh Muslim, it is narrated from Abu
Hurayrah (&) that the Messenger of AUah (g)
was on Mount
U?~ud,and it shook. The Messenger of AUah (@) said: "Be still,
Uhud, for there is no one on you but a Prophet, a Siddeeq and a
martyr." On it were the Prophet (@), Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmzn,
'Ali, Talhah, az-Zuhayr and Sa'd ibn Abi WaqqL (may Allah be
pleased with them
There are other hadiths that are more specific than this; they
said that 'Ali would be martyred in the land of Iraq and spoke of how
he would be assassinated, too. AU of this is a demonstration of the
truth of the prophethood of Mdpmniad (g),
and the fact that he said
that which AUah (&) told him by means of revelation and did not

612

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

speak from his own desire.1216The Prophet (@) told 'Ah (A&) what
was going to happen to him, and 'Ah believed that with certainty and
used to tell them about it. One of these reports narrated what 'Ali said
when he was heading towards Iraq. Abn al-Aswad ad-Du'ali narrated
that he heard 'Ali (&) say: "Abdullah ihn S a l h came to me when I
had put my foot in the stimp and said to me: 'Where are you going?'
I said: 'Iraq.' He said: 'Verily, if you go there, the edge of the sword
will strike you there.' I said: 'By Allah, I heard the Messenger of
Allah (g)
say that before.'" Ahu al-Aswad said: "I was amazed at
that and said: 'A fighter telling such a thing about himself!- i r r 1 2 1 7
'Ali (&) also spoke of this hadith in Yanhu' before he was
appointed to the caliphate, to Abu Fudaah al-Ansiri al-Badri (&),
who visited him when he was sick. He said: "I am not going to die of
this sickness (or this pain), for the Prophet
promised me that I
would not die until this (meaning his beard) was contaminated from
this (his head, because of bleeding from his head)."1218He told this
hadith to the Kharijites and to his companions. Al-Bayhaqi compiled
these hadiths and others in DalZ'il a n - ~ u b u w w a h , ' ~and
' ~ al-HZidh
Ibn Katheer compiled them in al-BidGyah w a n - ~ i h i ? ~ a hIt. ' was
~~~
narrated that Abdullah ihn Sah' said: "I heard 'Ali (&)
say
on
the
..
minbar: 'We are only waiting for a wretched man. The Messenger of
Allah (g)
promised me that this (his heard) would be contaminated
with the~hloodof this (his head).' They said: 'Tell us who your killer
is, so that we may go and annihilate his family.' He said: 'I urge you
by Allah not to kill anyone for my killing except the one who kills
me.'122' Then he recited some lines of poetry and said:

a)

Gird your loins in preparation for death, for death is imminent;
,,1222
Do not be scared of killing when it arrives in your valley.

Some reports go further than that and say that 'Ali (&) knew
who this wretched person was who would kill him. 'Ubaydah asS a l m h i narrated with a sound chain of narration that whenever 'Ali

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

613

saw lbn Maljam, he would say: "I want him to live, and he wants me
to die."1223
According to another report, 'Ali (&) said concerning
'Abdur-RWZn ibn Maljam: "Verily, this one is my killer." It was
said: "What is keeping you from dealing with him?" He said: "He
has not killed me yet."'224 The people asked him to appoint a
successor when he told them that he would be killed, hut he refused
to do that. It was narrated that Ahdullah ibn W h i ' said: "I heard 'Ali
say! 'This (his beard) will be contaminated from this (from blood
flowing from a wound to the head). What is this wretch waiting for?'
They said: '0 Amir al-Mn'mineen, tell us who he is so that we can
annihilate his family.' He said: 'By Alld., then you would be killing
because of me people who are not involved in my killing.' They said:
'Appoint a successor for us.' He said: 'No, but I will leave you as the
Messenger of Allah (g)
left you.' They said: 'What will you say to
your Lord when you meet Him?' He said: 'I will say: 0 Allah, You
left me with them as long as You wanted, then You took me to
Yourself. You are still with them; if You will, You can guide them,

It was also narrated
and if You will, You can let them go astray.
from 'Ali(&) that he said: "I heard as-Sidiq al-Masdooq (@) say:
'You will be struck here' a n d he pointed to his temples - 'and the
blood will flow until it contaminates your beard, and the one who
does that win be the most wretched among them, just as the one who
i r r 1226
hamstrung the she-camel was the most wretched of Thamood.

4.5. The martyrdom of Amir al-Mdmineen
'Ali (&) and the lessons to be learned from it
The battle of Nahrawk left a deep wound in the souls of the
Kharijites, which the passage of time only made more painful and
sorrowful, so a group of them decided to murder 'Ali (&) in
vengeance for their brethren who had been slain at Nahrawk.

614

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Biographers and historians all mention a famous report,'Z27which is
not free of flaws because it contains some contradictions, and we do
not think it unlikely that this important event was, like others,
subjected to embellishment in later times. Based on the sources and
studies, there seems to be a consensus that the killing of 'Ali (&)
took place at the hands of Kharijite elements in revenge for those who
had been killed at Nahrawk, It is difficult to accept and believe the
rest of the stories that are connected to this slaying, such as the love
story between Lbn Maljam and Q u t h , the alleged role of d-Ash'ath
al-Kindi -whose innocence we shall prove below -and so on. The
following are the details of the murder of 'Ali (&):

4.5.1. The meeting of the conspirators
The story of Ibn Maljam and his companions says that Ibn
Maljam, al-Buruk ibn Abdullah and 'Amr ibn Bakr at-Taymi got
together and talked about the people's situation. They criticised their
rulers, then they mentioned the people who had been killed at
Nabrawin and prayed for mercy for them, and they said: "What is life
worth after they are gone, our brethren who called the people to
worship their Lord and never feared the blame of the blamers for the
sake of Allah? Why don't we sell ourselves for the sake of Allah, and
go to the leaders of misguidance and try to kill them, so that the land
will be relieved of them and we may avenge our brethren thereby?"
Ibn Maljam, who was from Egypt, said: "I will take care of 'Ali ibn
Abi Tilib for you." Al-Bmk ibn Abdullah said: ''I will take care of
Mu'iiwiyah for you." 'Amr ibn Abi Bakr said: "I will take care of
'Amr ibn al-'A~for you." So they made a solemn pledge and swore
by Allah that none of them would give up or leave his target alone
until he killed him or died in the attempt. Then they took their swords
and put poison on them, and agreed that on the seventeenth of
Ramadan, each one of them would attack his target. Then each of
them went to the city where his target

4.5.2. Ibn Maljam's departure and his meeting
with Qutgrn, the daughter of ash-Shajnah
Ibn Maljam al-Mur2di belonged to the tribe of Kindah. He set
out and met his companions in Kufah, but he concealed his secret
from them for fear that they might disclose his plans. One day he saw
some people from the tribe of Taym ar-Rahzb, ten of whom 'Ali
(&) had killed on the day of Nahrawh, and they talked about their
slain ones.
On the same day, he met a woman of Taym ar-Rab2b named
Qu&n hint ash-Shajnah, whose father and brother had been killed in
the battle. She was a very beautiful woman. After he saw her, he
could not get her out of his mind, and he forgot the purpose for which
he had come. He proposed to her, and she said: "I shall not marry you
unless you do what I tell you." He said: "What is that?" She said:
"Three thousand, a slave man and woman, and the killing of 'Ali ihn
Abi T2lib." He said: "This will be your mahr. As for the killing of
'Ali (&), I do not think that you are serious about marrying me if
you want me to kill 'Ali." She said: "Seek him out and try to kill him.
If you succeed, then you and I will both be happy, and you can live
happily with me. If you are killed, then that which is with Allah is
better than this world and its adornments." He said: "By Allah, I have
only come to the city to kill 'Ali, so you will have what you asked
for." She said: "I will find someone to help you and assist you in
achieving what you want."
She sent for a man of her people, Taym ar-Rabzb, whose name
was Wardk. She spoke to him, and he responded. Ibn Maljam went
to a man from Ashja', whose name was Shabeeb ibn Bajrah, and said
to him: "Will you be interested in something that will bring you
honour in this world and the hereafter?' He said: "What is it?" Ibn
Maljam said: "Killing 'Ali ibn Abi T2lih." Shabeeb said: "May your
mother be bereft of you! This is something terrible. How can you kill

616

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

'Ali?" Ibn Maljam said: "I will lie in wait for him in the mosque, then
when he comes to pray the dawn prayer, we will attack him and kill
him. If we survive, then we will be happy and will have gotten
revenge; if we are killed, then that which is with Allah is better than
this world and everything in it." Shabeeb said: "Woe to you, if it was
someone other than 'Ali, it would be more bearable to me. You know
the sacrifices he made for Islam and that he was one of the first to
stand with the Prophet (g).
I do not feel comfortable with the idea of
killing him." lbn Maljam said: "Do you not know that he killed the
people of Nahrawin, the righteous slaves of Allah?' Shabeeb said:
"Yes." Ibn Maljam said: "Then we should kill him in revenge for
those of our brethren whom he slew." Then Shabeeb agreed.
Then they went to Q u t h , who was observing i'tikiif in the
Great Mosque, and said to her: "We have agreed to kill 'Ali." She
said: "If you want, you may come to me." Ibn Maljam went back to
her on the night before Friday, the night before the morning on which
'Ali was killed in 40 AH. He said: "This is the night on which I
agreed with nly two companions that each of us would kill his
target." She brought silk bands and tied them around their chests,
then they took their swords and sat opposite the door from which 'Ali
would come out. When he came out, Shabeeb struck him with his
sword, but his sword hit the jamb of the door or a small window. Ibn
Maljam struck him on the head with his sword. Wardin ran away and
entered his house, and a man of his father's tribe entered upon him as
he was taking the silk band from his chest. He asked: "What is this
silk and sword?" They told him what had happened, and he left, then
he came back with his sword, pounced on Wardin and killed him.
Shabeeb went out towards the gates of Kindah before dawn. A
man from Hadramawt, whose name was 'Uwaymir, caught up with
him, and Shabeeb still had his sword in his hand. Shabeeb grabbed
the Ha&ami man and threw him to the gronnd. When he saw the

'Ali ibn Abi Ttlib

61 7

people coming after him and he still had his sword in his hand, he
feared for his life, so he dropped the sword and managed to escape by
mingling with the crowd of people. They also chased Ibn Maljam and
caught up with him, then a man from Hamadfin, whose kunyah was
Abu Adma', took his sword and struck him in the leg, bringing him to
the ground.
'Mi (&) was late for the prayer, so Ja'dah ihn Hubayrah ihn
Abi Wahb took his place and led the people in the dawn prayer. 'Ali
(&) said: "Bring the man to me." He was brought, and 'Ali said: "0
enemy of Allah, did I not treat you well?" He said: "Yes." He said:
"What made you do this?" He said: "I sharpened it for forty days and
I asked Allah to cause the worst of His creation to be killed by it."
'Ali (&) said: "I don't think but that you will be killed by it; I think
you are the worst of His creation.rr1229

4.5.3. Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah narrated
the story of the slaying of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
Ibn al-Hanafiyyah said: "By Allah, on that night on which 'Ali
was struck, I was praying in the Great Mosque with a large number of
the people of the city. They were praying near the door, standing,
bowing and prostrating, and they never got tired from the beginning of
the night until the end. When 'Ali came out for the dawn prayer, he
started calling out: '0 people, the prayer, the prayer.' I do not know
whether he came out of the door and said these words or not, but I saw
the flash of the sword and I heard (the words): 'Ruling is for Allah, 0
'Ali, not for you andnot for your companions.' I saw a sword and then
a second sword. Then I heard 'Ali saying: 'Don't let the man escape.'
The people ran after him from all sides, and soon Ibn Maljam was
caught and hrought to 'Mi. 1 was among those of the people who
entered, and I heard 'Ali (&) saying: 'A life for a life. If I die, then
kill him as he killed me, and if I live, I shall decide about him.'"1230

618

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

He sajd that the people went to al-Hasan, and they were upset
by what had happened to 'Ali (4).
While they were with him and
Ibn Maljam was tied up before him, Urnm Kulthoom bint 'Ali called
out to him, weeping: "0 enemy of Allah, my father will be fine, but
Allah is going to humiliate you." He said: "For whom are you
weeping? By Allah, 1bought it (the sword) for one thousand, and I
put enough poison on it for one thousand. If this blow had struck all
the people of the city, none of them would have ~urvived."'~~'

4.5.4. The doctor's advice to 'Ali (&) and his
inclination towards the process of consultation
It was narrated that Abdullah ibn Maik said: "The doctors
gathered around 'Ali (&) on the day he was wounded, and the most
knowledgeable of them in medicine was Atheer ibn 'AIIUasSukooni, who had been the personal physician of Chosroes. Atheer
got the fresh lung of a sheep, took a vein from it and inserted it into
'Ali's wound; then he inflated the vein and pulled it out, and there
was some white brain matter on it, so he knew that the blow had
reached his brain. He said: '0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, give your final
instructions, for you are going to die."'1232
It was said that Jundub ibn Abdullah entered upon 'Ali (&)
and asked him something. He said: "0 Amir al-Mu'mineen, if we

4.5.5. Final advice of Amir al-Mu'mineen
'Ali to his sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn
(may AUah be pleased with them all)
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali (&) called for al-Hasan and alHusayn and said: ''I urge you to fear Allah and not to seek worldly

luxury, even if it becomes available to you. Do not weep for anything
that you have lost (of worldly gains). Speak the truth, show
compassion to orphans, help the destitute, and strive for the hereafter.
Be an opponent of the wrongdoers and support the one who is
wronged. Act upon what is in the Book and never fear the blame of
the blamers (when striving) for the sake of Allah." Then he looked at
Mulpmmad ibn al-Hanaiiyyah and said: "Have you beard the advice
I gave to your two brothers?"1234He said: "Yes." He said: "I advise
you likewise. I advise you to respect your two brothers because of
their great rights over you. Follow them, and do not decide about
anything without consulting them." Then he said: "I advise you both
to take care of him, for he is the son of your father, and you know that
your father loved him." He said to al-Hasan: "I advise you, 0 my
son, to fear Allah, establish regular prayer on time, and pay zak% to
those who are entitled to it. Do wudoo' well, for there is no prayer
without purification, and no prayer is accepted from one who
withholds zakih. I advise you to forgive others, suppress your anger,
uphold ties of kinship, be forbearing with the ignorant, keep seeking
knowledge of Islam, verify the facts before making any decision,
always read the Qur'an, be a good neighbour, enjoin what is good
and forbid what is evil, and avoid immoral actions.rr 1235
When death was imminent, he gave the following advice:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
This is the advice given by 'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib, affuming that he hears
witness that there is no God except Allah alone, with no partner or
associate, and that Mulpmrnad is His slave and His Messenger. He
sent His Messenger [Muhammad (@)I with guidance and the
religion of truth (Islam), to make it superior over all religions even
though the polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the
Oneness of Allah hate it.1236Verily, my prayer, my sacrifice, my
living and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the 'alameen

'Ali's attitude towards tlze Kharijites and Shia

(mankind, jinn and all that exists). He has no partner. This I have
been commanded, and I am of the ~ u s l i m s . ' ~ ~ '

"I advise you, 0 Hasan and all my children and family, to fear
Allah your Lord, and never die except in a state of slam,'^^* and
hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah (this Qur'an), and
be not divided among yourselves.'z39 I heard Ahu d-Qisim say:
'Reconciling between people is better than supererogatory prayers
and fasts.' Check on your relatives and uphold ties with them, then
your reckoning with Allah will he easier. I urge you by Allah to he
kind to orphans, and do not silence them or ignore them when they
are with you. I urge you by Allah to be kind to your neighbours, for
your Prophet (g)
enjoined that, and he continued to enjoin that until
we thought that he would make the neighbour an heir. I urge you by
Allah to take care of the Qur'an, and do not let others he better at
putting it into practice than you. I urge you by Allah to take care of
the prayer, for it is the foundation of your religion. I urge you by
Allah to take care of the House of your Lord; do not forsake it as long
as you live. I urge you by Allah to engage in jihad for the sake of
Allah with your wealth and your lives. I urge you by Allah to take
care of zakih, for it extinguishes the wrath of the Lord. I urge you by
Allah to take care of those whom your right hands possess (female
slaves).
"Prayer, prayer; never fear the blame of the blamers for the
sake of Allah. Allah will suffice you against anyone who wants to
harm or transgress against you. Speak kindly to people as Allah has
commanded you, and do not give up enjoining what is good and
forbidding what is evil, lest the worst of you attain positions of
authority, then you will call upon Allah hut receive no response. I
enjoin you to keep in touch with one another and help one another;
beware of turning away from one another, cutting off ties with one
another and becoming divided. Cooperate in righteousness and piety;

i

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

621

do not cooperate in sin and transgression. Fear Allah, for Allah is
severe in punishment. May Allah take care of you, my household.
May the teachings of the Prophet (@) continue to guide you. I bid
you farewell, peace be upon you and the mercy of AUah."
Then he did not say anything except LA ilciha illci Allrih (There
is none worthy of worship other than Allah) until he died, may Allah
he pleased with him, in the month of Ramadan 40 AH.'^^'

(s)

According to another report, he was killed on the morning of
21 t am ad an.'^^' This report may be understood as referring to the
day on which he left this world, because he remained alive for three
days after he was struck by this wretched man.'='

4.5.6. 'Ali's prohibition of mutilation
or torture of his killer
'Ali (&) said: "Detain this man. Then if I die, kill him, and if
I live, wounds equal for equal."1243 According to another report, he
said: "Feed him and give him water and treat him well. If I recover,
then I am in charge of the matter and I will forgive him if I want, or if
I want, I will settle the score."1244There is some additional material
in another report, according to which he said: "If I die, then kill him
as he killed me but do not overstep the mark, for Allah likes not the
transgressors."'245 'Ahforbade al-Hasan to mutilate him and said:
"0 Banu 'Abdul-Mugalib, I do not want you to indulge in shedding
the blood of the Muslims, saying he killed Amir al-Mu'mineen, he
killed Amir al-Mu'mineen. No one should he killed in retaliation for
my killing except the one who killed me. Listen, 0 Hasan. If I die
from this blow of his, then give him hlow for hlow, but do not
mutilate the man, for I heard the Messenger of Allah (&2) saying:
'Beware of mutilation, even of a ferocious dog."''246

622

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

There are many reports about the final words of 'Ali (&)
concerning the one who killed him; some of these reports are sound
and some of them are weak. The report which says that 'Ali (&)
gave instructions to bum his body after killing him has a weak chain
of narration. Other reports all say the same, that 'Ali issued
instructions that the man be killed if he died as a result of his shike,
and forbade them to do anything other than that. These reports
support one another and reach such a level that they become binding
evidence.
Moreover, Amir al-Mu'mineen did not regard him as an
apostate and order that he be killed; rather he forbade that when some
of the Muslims wanted to kill him, and he said: "Do not kill the man.
If I recover, then wounds equal for
and if I die, then
r , 1248
execute him.
The famous historical report says: "When 'Ali (&) died, alHasan sent for Ibn Maljam, who said to al-Hasan: 'How about a deal?
By AUah, I never made a pledge to Allah but I fulfilled it. I made a
pledge to Allah, between the Black Stone and Maq2m Tbriheem, that
I would kill 'Ali and Mu'2wiyah or die in the attempt. If you wish,
you may let me go and try to kill MuS2wiyah,and I promise you by
Allah that if I do not kill him, or if I kill him and survive, I will come
to you and put my hand in yours.' Al-Hasan said to him: 'By Allah,
not until you see hellfire,' and be went and killed him.'249 Then the
people took him and burned him with fire." This report has an
interrupted chain of narration,
The sound reports, which are more befitting to al-Hasan, alHusayn and Ah1 al-Bayt, say that they adhered to the fmal
instructions of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'ALi in dealing with 'AbdurR & m h ibn Maljam.
There is a report - which is not sound - that says: "When
'Ali was buried, they brought Ibn Maljam, and the people gathered,

'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib

623

bringing naphtha and wood. Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah, alHusayn and Abdullah ihn Ja'far ibn Ja'far ibn Abi Tilib said: 'Let us
enjoy our revenge on him.' Abduuah cut off his hands and feet, and
he did not speak or show any fear. Then his eyes were put out, but he
did not panic; he said: 'You are applying kohl to your uncle's eyes,'
and recited the soorah $Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has
created [all that exists]...) (Qur'an 96: 1) to the end, with his eye
sockets bleeding. Then orders were given to catch hold of his tongue
in order to cut it out, at which point he panicked. It was said to him:
'Why are you panicking?' He said: 'This is not panic, but I hate to be
in this life, conscious, without remembering Allah.' They cut out his
tongue, then they burned him. He was dark skinned with a handsome
face, gaps between his teeth and hair down to his earlobes, and on his
forehead was the mark of prostration.rr1251 Again, this report is not
sound.
A&-Dhahabi said concerning 'Abdur-Rahmh ibn Maljam:
"He was the killer of 'Ali (&), a Khaijite and evildoer... He took
part in the conquest of Egypt alongside prominent people. He was
one of those who had knowledge of the Qur'an and studied Islam. He
was one of Banu Tadool and was a prominent hero in Egypt. He
learned the Qur'an from Mu'zdh ibn Jabal and was a devoted
worshipper. It was said that he was the one who sent Subaygha alTameemi to 'Umar (&) to ask him about what was not clear to him
of the text of the Qur'an. Then his destiny overtook him, and he did
what he did.
"According to the Kharijites, he is one of the best of the
Ummah. Concerning Ibn Maljam, 'ImrZn ibn eat& al-Khzriji said:
'What a beautiful blow from a righteous man, who was seeking
thereby nothing except the pleasure of the One of the mighty Throne.
Sometimes I remember him and think of him as the best of people
before Allah.'

624

'Ali's attitude towards the Khanjites and Shiu

"According to the RZdis, Ibn Maljam will be the most
wretched of creation in the hereafter. According to us, Ah1 asSunnah, he is one of those who we hope will be in hell, but we
believe that it is possible that Allah may forgive him. He is not as
either the Kharijites or the R Z d i s think of him. He comes under the
same ruling as the killers of 'Uthmh, az-Zubayr, Ta&ah, Sa'eed ibn
Jubayr, 'Ammk, Kh2rijah and al-Husayn. AU of these killers we
disavow and hate them for the sake of Allah, but we leave their case
to Allah ( + ) to decide as He
As for al-Buruk ibn Abdullah, on the night on which 'Ali was
struck, he lay in wait for Mu'iwiyah. When Mu'iwiyah came out to
pray the dawn prayer, he attacked him with his sword, and his sword
fell on Mn'%wiyah's backside, then he was captured. At-Bumk said:
"I have some news that may please you tonight; will it benefit me
with you if I tell it to you?" Mu'iwiyah said: "Yes." Al-Buruk said:
"A brother of mine has killed 'Ali this night." Mu'iwiyah said:
"Perhaps he could not manage to do that." A l - B d said: "No, 'Ali
comes out with no one to guard him." Mu'Zwiyah ordered that he be
killed, then he sent for as-Si'idi, who was a physician. The doctor
said: "Choose one of two ways of treatment: I will either heat a piece
of iron and put it where the sword fell, or I will give you medicine to
drink, but you will never be able to have children after that, although
you will recover. The sword that struck you was poisoned."
Mu'gwiyah said: "As for fire, I cannot bear it. As for not having any
more children, I have Yazeed and Abdullah, who are enough joy for
me." So the doctor gave him that medicine and he recovered, but he
had no more children after that. Because of this incident, Mn'2wiyah
ordered that booths be set up and night guards appointed, and he
appointed police to stand by his head when he prostrated.
As for 'Amr ibn Bakr, he lay in wait for ' A m ibn al-'AS that
night, but he did not come out because he had a stomachache. 'Amr

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib

625

ibn al-'AS told Khirijah ibn Hudhsah, who was his chief of police
and was of (the tribe) Banu 'Amir ibn Lu'ayy, to go out and lead the
prayer. 'Amr ibn Balcr attacked and killed him, thinking that he was
'Amr ibn al-'As. The people caught him and took him to 'Amr ibn al'As, greeting him as the governor. The killer said: "Who is this?"
They said: " ' A m (ibn d-'A$)." He said: "Who did I kill?" They
said: "Kh2rijah ibn Hudhsah." He said to ' A m ibn al-'AS: "Woe to
you, 0 evildoer. By Allah, I did not think that he was anyone but
you." 'Amr said: "Yon wanted me, but Allah wanted Khirijah."
Then 'Amr ordered that he be executed.1253

4.5.7. The length of 'Ali's caliphate, the location
of his grave and the age at which he was killed
According to Khaleefah ibn Khayy;!, 'Ali's caliphate lasted
four years, nine months and six days - or, it was said, three days or
fourteen days.'254 But it seems that it was four years, nine months
and three days, because allegiance was sworn to him as caliph on 18
Dhul-Ifijjah 35 AH, and he died as a martyr on 21 Ramadan 40

AH."^^

(4)

The body of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
was washed by d Hasan, al-Husayn and Abdullah ibn Ja'far (may Allah be pleased
with them) and was shrouded in three pieces of cloth, among which
was no chemise.1256 Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (4)
offered the funeral
prayer for him, saying takbeer four times.'257 According to one
report with no chain of narration, he said nine takbeers over him.1258
As for the location of his grave, the reports differ concerning it.
Ibn alJawzi narrated a number of reports concerning that, then he
said: "Allah knows best which is most correct."1259 Among the
reports concerning this matter are the following:

626

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

*:

That d-Hasan ibn 'Ali (&) buried him by the mosque in
ar-Rabbah, which is near-the gates of Kindah, before the
people finished praying the dawn prayer.1z60

0 3 That he was buried at night in Kufah near the governor's
palace beside the J h i ' mosque, and the location of his
grave was unmarked.lZ6'
+:*
0%

That his son d-Hasan (&) took him to adi in ah.'^^^
That the grave which is just outside Kufah, the shrine in
Najaf, is the grave of 'Ali (&), but this was rejected by
some scholars such as Shurayk ibn Abdullah an-Nakha'i,
the qidi of Kufah (d. 178 AH) and Muhammad ihn
Sulaymk al-Hacjrami (d. 297).1263

In fact, the innovation of the so-called shrine of 'Ali (&) in
Najaf was introduced during the days of Banu Buwayh, who were
R Z d i Shia, during the Abbasid era. The Shia fabricated this idea, as
is their wont, during the fourth century AH, but the scholars
unanimously agree that this is not the grave of 'Ali (&); it was said
that it is the grave of al-Mugheerah ihn Shu'bah. Ibn Taymiyah said:
"As for the shrine in Najaf, people of howledge are unanimously
agreed that it is not the grave of 'Ali; it was said that it is the grave of
d-Mugheerah ihn Shu'bah instead. No one said that this was the
grave of 'Ali, and no one went there for the purpose of visiting 'Ali's
grave, for more than three hundred years, despite the fact that so
many of Ah1 al-Bayt, the Shia and others, ruled in Kufah. It was only
taken as a shrine during the reign of Banu Buwayh -the Persians ,,1264
more than three hundred years after the death of 'Ah.
There is also a difference of opinion concerning 'Ali's age
when he was killed. Some said that he was fifty-nine years old when
he was killed; others say that he was sixty-five or sixty-three years
old. This last view is the most correct.1265

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

627

4.5.8. The speech of al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (&)
after the slaying of his father
It was narrated that 'Am ibn Hubnashi said that al-uasan ibn
'Ali addressed them after the killing of 'Ali (&) and said: "A man
left you yesterday who was never preceded by the early ones in
knowledge and will never be caught up with by the later ones. The
Messenger of Allah (g)
used to send him on expeditions and give
him the banner, and he would not give up fighting until victory was
granted to him.1266He did not leave behind any gold or silver, except
for seven hundred dirhams from his stipend, which he was keeping
for the servant of his family."1267

4.5.9. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqss (&) praises 'Ali (4)
It was narrated from Rabee'ah alJarshi that mention was made
of 'Ali in the presence of a man, and Sa'd ibn Abi W a q q i ~was also
present. Sa'd said to him: "Do you remember 'Ali? Verily, he had
four qualities which, if I had one of them, would be dearer to me than
snch and snch." And he mentioned the red camels. These four
qualities were: the Prophet's saying "I shall give the banner..."; his
saying, "You are to me like Haroon was to Moosa"; and his saying,
"If I am a person's mawla, 'Ali is also his mawla."
(The narrator
forgot the last one.)

4.5.10. Abdullah ibn 'Umar praises
'Ali ibn Abi Tslib (&)
It was narrated that Sa'd ibn 'Ubaydah said: "A man came to
Ibn 'Umar and asked him about 'Uthm2n (&,). He mentioned his
good deeds and said: 'Perhaps that bothers you?' He said: 'Yes.' He
said: 'May Allah cause your nose to be rubbed in the dust!' Then he
asked him about 'Ali (&), and he mentioned his good deeds and
said: 'It is all hue, and that is his house in the midst of the houses of

628

'Ali's anitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

the Prophet (g).'
Then he said: 'Perhaps that annoys you? He said:
'Indeed it does.' He said: 'May Allah cause your nose to be rubbed in
the dust! Go away and do whatever you can against me.""269

4.5.11. How Mu1$wiyah responded
to the news of 'Ali's slaying
When the news of 'Ali's slaying reached Mu'zwiyah, he
began to weep. His wife said to him: "Are you weeping for him when
you fought him?" He said: "Woe to you, you do not know what the
people have lost of virtue, understanding and kn~wledge."'~'~
Mu'Zwiyah used to write to 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib (&) and ask him
about the new issues he faced. When ~ u ' Z w i ~ aheard
h
that 'Ali
(&,) had been killed, he said: "Knowledge and understanding have
been lost with the death of 'Ali ihn Abi TZlib." His brother 'Utbah
said to him: "Do not let the people of Syria hear you saying that." He
told him: "Leave me alone."'271
During his caliphate, Mu'Zwiyah asked Dirk as-Sa&i to
describe 'Ali (&) to him. He said: "Excuse me from that, 0 Amir alMu'mineen." He said: "No, I insist." He said: "If I must describe
him, then by Allah he was far-sighted and strong in supporting Islam;
he spoke the truth'272 and ruled with justice; knowledge
- flowed from
him, and his wisdom manifested itself in all that he did; he felt
alienated from this world and its adornments, and felt at ease with the
night and its loneliness; he shed tears frequently and thought deeply;
he liked gannents that were short and food that was coarse; he was
like one of us and would answer us if we asked him, and tell us if we
questioned him. By AUah, despite his bringing us close to him, we
could hardly speak to him, out of respect. He showed great respect to
people of piety and religious commitment and brought the poor
close; the strong man could not have any hope (of being let off by
'Ali) if he was in the wrong, and the weak man could never despair of

'Ali ibn Abi Tiilib

629

his justice. I hear witness that I saw him standing in the middle of the
night, when the stars appeared deeper in the sky, holding on to his
heard and groaning like one in pain, weeping like one who is
grieving, saying: '0 worldly delights, tempt someone else; are you
trying to tempt me or do you have hope that I could be tempted? No
way, no way. I have divorced you thrice, an irrevocable divorce.
Your time is short, and you are insignificant. I complain of little
provision, a long journey and loneliness on the road."' Then
Mu'iwiyah wept and said: "May Allah have mercy on Ahu d-Hasan.
By Allah, he was like that. How great is your grief for him, 0 DirC?"
He said: "Like the grief of a woman whose child was slaughtered in
her lap."'273
It was narrated that 'Umar ibn 'AbdulL'Azeez said: "I saw the
Messenger of Allah (g)
in a dream, and Abu Bakr and 'Umar were
sitting with him. I greeted him with sd2m and sat down, and while I
was sitting, 'Ali and Mu'iwiyah came in and were led into a room,
then the door was closed while I was looking on. Soon 'Ali came out,
saying 'Judgement has been passed in my favour, by the Lord of the
Ka'bah.' Soon after that, Mut2wiyah came out saying, 'I have been
forgiven, by the Lord of the ~ a ' b a h . " " ~ ~ ~
Ibn 'As%ir narrated that a man said to Abu Zur'ah at-Rki: "I
hate Mu'iwiyah." He said to him: "Why?" He said: "Because he
fought 'Ali." Abu Zur'ah said to him: "Woe to you; Mu'iwiyah's
Lord is Most Merciful and Mu'iwiyah's opponent was noble and
generous. What has the matter between them got to do with you?
May Allah be pleased with them both."1275

4.5.12. What al-Hasan al-Ba~ri
(may Allah have mercy on him) said
Al-Hasan al-Bqri was asked about 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&),
.,
and he said: "By Allah, 'Ali was a straight arrow that Allah sent

630

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

against His enemy, the prominent jurist of this Ummah, whose
service to Islam cannot be denied, one of the most senior figures in
Islam, a relative of the Messenger of Allah (&). He was never
heedless of the command of Allah and never feared the blame of the
blamers, he never showed any interest in worldly gains, he adhered to
the Qur'an in the most perfect manner, and thus he attained the
pleasure of Allah. This was 'Ali ibn Abi T2lib (may Allah be pleased
with him)."1276

4.5.13. What m a d ibn Hanbal said
conceming the caliphate of 'Ali (&)
Abdullah ibn Ahmad ibn Hanbal said: "I was sitting before my
father one day when a group of people from Karkh came and talked a
great deal about the caliphate of Abu Bakr, the caliphate of 'Umar ibn
al-Kha@b and the caliphate of 'Uthmgn, and they talked even more
about the caliphate of 'Ali ibn Abi T%b. My father raised his head to
look at them and said: '0 people, you have talked too much about
'Ali and the caliphate, and the caliphate and 'Ali. Do you think that
the caliphate adorned 'Ali? On the contrary, 'Ali adorned it."'1277

4.5.14. Al-Ash'ath ibn Qays is innocent
of the murder of 'Ali (&)
Some reports accuse al-Ash'ath ihn Qays of being involved in
the murder of 'Ali. Al-Ya'qoobi said: " 'Abdur-Raljmin ibn Maljam
stayed with al-Ash'ath ibn Qays for a month, sharpening his
sword."1278 Ibn Sa'd stated in at-TabaqZt: " 'Abdur-Raljmh ibn
Maljam spent that night, preceding the morning on which he had
decided to kill 'Ali, with al-Ash'ath ibn Qays in the place where he
used to pray. Then when dawn was about to break, al-Ash'ath said:
'Dawn has broken.' 'Abdur-Rahmsn ibn Maljam and Shabeeb ibn
Bajrah stood up and picked up their swords, then went and sat

'Ali ibn Abi Trilib

631

opposite the door from which 'Ali would come out."1279This report
is weak,
There is no evidence for accusing al-Ash'ath because when we
examine the role be played in 'Ali's caliphate, we find that he was
sincere and loyal to 'Ali (&). He was the fnst one to fight the people
of Syria in the battle for the water, and he showed enmity towards the
Kharijites from the time they fust appeared. He is the one who told
'Ali that the Kharijites were saying that 'Ali had repented from his
sin and recanted the arbitration, and he fought them at Nahrawh. He
was also keen to strengthen his ties with Ah1 al-Bayt, and he gave his
daughter in marriage to al-Hasan ibn 'Ali (&). When al-Hasan
wanted to go to his bride, the tribe of Kindah spread their cloaks from
his door to the door of al-~sh'ath.'~" Al-Ash'ath died forty days
after the murder of 'Ali, and al-Hasan ibn 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib offered
the funeral prayer for him.'282 Al-Hasan was the husband of his
daughter.lZs3There is no narration from the family of 'Ali ibn Abi
Tilib (&) to suggest that they levelled this accusation against alAsh'ath or that they discussed it with any member of al-Ash'ath's
family. The murder of 'Ali was carried out only by the Kharijites, and
was mostly within the context of avenging the slain of ~ a h r a w h . ' ~ ~ ~

4.5.15. The danger posed by the misguided
and deviant groups to the Muslims
When misguided sects and deviant groups spread in Muslim
lands, they pose a danger to the Muslims, threatening security and
stability, making the people doubt their beliefs and spreading
corruption and rnin. That was the case with the Khariiite renegades
who rebelled against 'Ali (&) and regarded him as a disbeliever, a
group
.of whom caught
- him unawares and killed him, as we have seen
above. They claimed that they were selling their souls for the sake of
Allah by doing this deed, but they had no proof or evidence for that;

632

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

rather they were following whims and desires and obeying Satan.
When we understand from the previous information that the
K h ~ j i t e swere the cause of 'Ali's slaying, and we recognise the
corruptness of their way of thinking, then we will realise that the
Muslim Ummah must beware of them, warn against them and oppose
them. The scholars and callers to Islam have to do their part so that
security and safety may he established; then the lights of the Sunnah
will shine forth, and the fires of innovation will be extinguished. This
can be achieved in the best manner by supporting the belief of Ahl asSunnah wal-Jam2'ah and standing up to innovation and innovators.
These are means of reviving societies, and this is the best way to
bring Muslims together and unite them. Whoever ponders the
lengthy history of Islam will realise that the states which were based
on and adhered to the Sunnah are the ones that united the Muslims,
adopted the ideology of jihad, and enjoined what is good and forbade
what is evil; by means of these states, Islam prevailed in the past and
in modem history. This is unlike those states that were established on
a foundation of innovation and created chaos, division and
innovation, leading to disunity; those states soon died out and
became extinct.'z85

4.5.16. The deeply entrenched grudges
against the sincere believers that
filled the hearts of the Kharijites
The deeply entrenched grudges against the sincere believers
that filled the hearts of the Kharijites are indicated by the words of
'Abdnr-RarnZn ibn Maljam, who said concerning his sword: "I
bought it (the sword) for one thousand, and I put enough poison on it
for one thousand. If this blow had struck all the people of the city,
none of them would have survived."'286

Xli ibn Abi Tilib

633

These words of his highlight the blatant enmity harboured by
these Kharijites, not only against the ordinary believers but also
against prominent leaders such as 'Ali ibn Abi TZlib (&), whose
character combined the greatest and noblest characteristics. Look,
may AUah bless you, at how conupt ideas and deviant thoughts, and
those who promote them, can lead people to such a wretched level
that they assassinate believers and leave idolaters alone.lZx7

4.5.17. Impact of a bad environment
on the people who live in it
A had environment has an impact on the people who live in it,
even if some of them love justice and strive for it. Ibn Maljam went to
a man from Ashja', whose name was Shabeeb ibn Bajrah, and said to
him: "Will you be interested in something that will bring you honour
in this world and the hereafter?" Shabeen said: 'What is it?" Ibn
Maljam said: "Killing 'Ali ibn Ahi Tsib." Shabeeb said: "May your
mother be bereft of you! This is something tenible. How can you kill
'Ali?" Ibn Maljam said: "I will lie in wait for him in the mosque, then
when he comes to pray the dawn prayer, we will attack him and kill
him. If we survive, then we will he happy and will have gotten
revenge; if we are killed, then that which is with Allah is better than
this world and everything in it." Shabeeb said: "Woe to you, if it was
someone other than 'Ali,it would be more bearable to me. You know
the sacrifices he made for Islam and that he was one of the first to
stand with the Prophet (&). I do not feel comfortable with the idea of
killing him." Ibn Maljam said: "Do you not know that he killed the
people of Nahrawh, the righteous slaves of Allah?" Shabeeb said:
"Yes." Ibn Maljam said: "Then we should kill him in revenge for
those of our brethren whom he slew." The report of at-Tabari says
that be was persuaded by these

Look, may Allah bless you, at how people with misguided
ideas can influence the people that they mix with and sit with. Even
though Shabeeb was not happy with the idea of killing 'Ali because
of what he knew of his great efforts in support of Islam and his
seniority with regard to being with the Prophet (g),
he responded to
Ibn Maljam when he persuaded him with his specious arguments,
reminding him that 'Ali (&) had killed his fellow Kharijite
renegades. Thus he stirred up his emotions and convinced him, even
though these brethren had been killed lawfully, not unlawfully. He
responded to his request and agreed with him, and the outcome was
corrupted thinking, a mined reputation and obvious loss.
This reminds every Muslim to beware of keeping company
with anyone who has corrnpt beliefs and deviant ideas, and to hasten
to sit with devoted scholars who know the trnth and act upon it and
guide people to that which serves their best interests in this world and
the hereafter. If he does not accept that straight path and mixes with
these deviants and is influenced by their beliefs, he will end up biting
his fingers in regret at a time when regret is to no avail,1z89as Allah
(&) says:
dhsim [wrongdoer, oppressor,
(And [remember] the Day when the polytheist] will bite at his hands, he will say: 'Oh! Would that I had
taken a path with the Messenger [Muhammad].' 'Ah! Woe to me!
Would that I had never en so-and-so as an intimate friend! He
indeed led me astray from the Reminder [this Qur'an] after it had
come to me. And Satan is to man ever a deserter in the hour of need.'b
(Qur'an 25: 27-29)

These are some of the lessons to be leamed from the slaying of
Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T a b (&), the devoted scholar
who spent his entire life submitting to Allah (&), turning to Him
always. He showed us a blessed way to follow and set a blessed
example for us to emulate.

4.6. Eulogies for Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali
4.6.1. Abu al-Aswad ad-Du'ali
Ibn 'Abdul-Ban said: "Most narrators attribute these lines of
verse to Umm al-Haytham bint ai-'Ary2n an-Nakha'iyyah:
0 eye, why do you not help us,
why don't you weep for Amir al-Mu'mineen?
Umm Kulthoom weeps for him.
Tell the Kharijites, wherever they are,
May Allah never comfort those who rejoice in his death.
Is it in the month of Ramadan that you made us grieve
for the loss of the best of all people?

...
He acquired all beautifil qualities, but above all he attained
the love of the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.
Quraysh know very well that you are the best among them
in lineage and religious commitment.
If you see the face of Abu Husayn [meaning Ali],
you will see the fill moon above those who look at it.
Before his death we were in a good state and
we could see the mawla of the Messenger of Allah with us,
Striving to establish the truth and never doubting it,
being fair to enemies and relatives alike,
Never withholding any knowledge he had,
and he was never one of the tyrants.
When the people lost 'Ali, it was as $
they were cattle lost for years."1z90

4.6.2. Ismsee1 ibn M a a m m a d al-Himyari
Ask Quraysh, if you are not aware, who was the most
steadfast and strongest in devotion to the faith?

636

'Ali's attitude towards the Kharijites and Shia

Who was the earliest in Islam, greatest in knowledge
and had the best wife and children,
The one who declared the oneness of Allah
when Quraysh disbelieved the Prophet,
calling upon idols and rivals alongside Allah?
Who was the most just, most knowledgeable,
the most sincere in JirlJilling promises?
If they tell you the truth, they will only mention Abu Hasan
['Ali], unless you ask someone who envies the righteous."91

4.6.3. Bakr ibn HammSd at-~~harti"~'
and his
refutation of the Kharijite poet 'ImrSn ibn ~ a t f i ? i n " ~ ~
The Kharijite poet 'Imr2n ibn Hat&n said:
What a beaut~fulblow from a righteous man,
who was seeking thereby nothing except
the pleasure of the One of the mighty Throne
Sometimes I remember him and think of him
as the best of people before Allah.

Bakr ibn Hamm2d at-Taarti said in response to that:
Say to Ibn Maljam when the decree of Allah
inevitably comes to pass: 'Woe to you,
you have destroyed a pillar of Islam;
You have killed the best of those who walk the earth,
the first of people in Islam and faith;
The most knowledgeable of the Qur'an among people,
and the most knowledgeable of the Sunnah of the Messenger.
Rather the blow came to him from a misguided person
and that blow will land him in hell;
he will meet Allah when He is angry with him,

'Ali ibn Abi T6lib

637

As if he intended nothing by this blow
except to go to hell for eternity.1294

Thus Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib departed this
world after striving mightily in jihad, and with his death, one of the
brightest and purest chapters of history came to an end. History
knows him as a brilliant man of a unique calibre. His ultimate aim
was to seek the pleasure of Allah (B);
his main concern was that
Islam should prevail; his greatest wish was that the d i n g s of Allah
( s ) should govern the world of mankind, and his highest aspiration
was that justice should be achieved among his subjects.
Studying the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphs will strengthen
the resolve of the new generation of Muslims and guide them. It will
bring to life the beauty and splendour of the early days of Islam, teach
them that the affairs of the last of this Ummah will never be sound
except through that by which the affairs of the early generation
became sound, and help the callers to Islam, scholars and seekers of
knowledge to follow the example of that era. The Muslims should
study its characteristics and features, the attributes of its leaders and
community, its system of ruling and the way in which it governed
people's affairs. That will help the young people of this Ummah to
restore the Urnmah to its role of leading humanity.
I completed this book at 12.55 p.m. on Saturday, 7 Rabee' al&bir 1424 AW7 June 2003 CE, by the grace of Allah ( s ) . Praise
he to Allah first and foremost. I ask Him to accept this work, to open
people's hearts in order for them to benefit from it, and to bless it
from His bounty. Allah (&)says: (Whatever of mercy [i.e. of good],
Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it; and whatever He
may withhold, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the All-Mighty,
the All-Wise.) (Qur'arz 35: 2)

638

'Ali's attitude towards the h r i j i t e s and Shia

Upon the completion of this book, I cannot but stand before
Him with humility, turning to Him and acknowledging His blessings
and grace, recognising that I have no power and no strength of my
own. Allah ($) is the Bestower of blessings, He is the Giver of
honour, He is the Helper, and He is the guide. To Him be praise for
that with which He has blessed me from beginning to end. I ask Him,
may He be glorified, by His beautiful names and sublime attsibutes,
to make this work of mine sincerely for His sake alone and beneficial
to His slaves, and to reward me for every letter I have written and add
it to my record of good deeds. May He also reward my brothers who
helped me with all that they could to complete this humble effort. We
hope that every Muslim who reads this book will not forget in his
supplications the author, the slave of Allah who is in need of his
Lord's forgiveness, mercy and good pleasure, for a supplication
offered for one's brother in his absence will be answered, if Allah
(g)
wills. I end this book with the words of AUah (&): BMy Lord!
Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your
Favours which You have bestowed on me and on my parents, and
that I may do righteous good deeds that will please You, and admit
me by Your Mercy among Your righteous slaves.) (Qur'an 27: 19)
Glory and praise be to You, 0 Allah. I bear witness that there
is no god but You; I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You. And
the end of our supplication is: Praise be to AUah the Lord of the
Worlds.
A servant who is in need of his Lord's pardon,
forgiveness, mercy and good pleasure

is what AUah
has enabled me to compile in the
chapters of this book, which I have called in Arabic Seerat Ameer alMu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Trilib: Shakhfiyatuhu wa 'Afruhu
(Biography of Amir al-Mu'mineen 'Ali ibn Abi Tcilib - his Life and
Times). Whatever is correct herein is purely by the grace of Allah
(g),
to Whom be praise. Whatever errors are contained herein, I ask
Allah to forgive me, and I repent to Him; Allah (&) and His
Messenger (g)
bave nothing to do with them. However, I was keen
to avoid making mistakes so that I would not be deprived of reward. I
ask AUah (G)
to make this book of benefit to my Muslim brothers
and sisters, and I ask those who read it to remember me in their
prayers, for the supplication for one's brother in his absence will be
answered, if Allah wills. I end this book with the words of AUah
(!&): #Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who bave preceded us in
faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have
believed. Our Lord! Yon are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.%
(Qur'an 59: 10)

Glory and praise be to Yon, O Allah. I bear witness that there
is no God but You; I seek Your forgiveness and repent to You.
