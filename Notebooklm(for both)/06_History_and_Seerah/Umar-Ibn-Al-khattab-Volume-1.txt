d h e s e are tumultuous times in which much is changing.
The Muslim Ummah is faced with new challenges which it must
meet and overcome, whilst also striving for its very survival in some
parts of the world.
Those who study history know that there are patterns and
scenarios that are repeated over and over again as nations and
empires rise and fall. There is very little that has never happened
before, in one way or another. The current emergence of the "new
world order" is in many ways, nothing new. During the period
covered in this book, the life of 'Urnar ibn al-KhaGh, the Muslims
were also faced with a "new world order" as the old powers declined
and the new and vibrant movement of Islam moved to centre stage.
The "new world order" of 'Umar's time was controlled by
Shari'ah and motivated by the desire to spread true guidance, unlike
its modem counterpart,which is controlled by corporate interests and
motivated by greed. However, many of the challenges faced, then
and now, were (and are) matters that are not addressed directly in the
Qur'an and Sunnah. This is where the author of this book makes a
valuable contribution, by showing in detail how the Muslim
leadership during the golden age of Islam was able to rise to the
challenges and deal successfdly with them.
At a time of intense confusion within the Muslim ummah as to
which approach is best, amid conflicting calls to follow the way of
customs or traditions or to "modemize" and follow the west, this
book provides a practical model, in the life of 'Umar ibn al-Khat@b,

24

of how the Muslims can draw upon the lessons of the greatest era in
Islamic history - that of the Prophet &) and the Rightly-Guided
and apply it in practical terms to the issues that face us
Caliphs
now.

'Umar sought solutions &om the Qur'an and Sunnah to the
problems and challenges the ummah faced, but he was not rigid or
literal in his approach. He realized that simply repeating what has
worked in the past was not always the answer, and that it was
essential to understand the spirit of Shari'ah as well as the "letter of
the law". His approach was innovative (in the purely linguistic sense)
yet still firmly within the boundaries of Islam.
Although he was a man of immense and profound knowledge,
he consulted other scholars, knowledgable people and experts at
every step of the way. When an important decision was to be taken,
he would summon the senior Sahibah and consult with them, and the
decision would be taken by consensus only after thorough debate.
Far &ombeing a distant ruler, 'Umar was one whose approach
was very much "hands on". During his nightly patrols of Madeenah,
for which he was famous, he was able to discover what the common
people thought and was able to take action accordingly, such as when
he changed the rules to allow a stipend to be paid to Muslim children
&om birth and not &om the time they were weaned, because that
ruling made mothers hasten to wean their children, which caused
suffering to their infants.
When faced with the extensive famine of ar-Ramidah, 'Umar
was especially close to the people, ensuring that all were cared for,
providing food for the refugees who flocked to Madeenah and
leading by example, ensuring that he did not eat any better than his
people. He also took the bold step of delaying zakah payments and
suspending hadd punishments for the duration, until the rains fmally

'Umar ibn al-Khatjib

25

came and life returned to normal. During the plague of Amw2s he
also introduced what we would call emergency measures, such as
placing restrictions on movement into and out of the affected areas.

In military matters, although he was based in Madeenah,
'Umar kept a close eye on the campaigns and directed the course of
battle. Through an extensive communications network, 'Umar was
kept informed of the hoops' progress and received intelligence about
the lay of the land and the enemy's strengths and weakness, and was
thus able to issue detailed instructions. But his interest went fuaher
than that. 'Umar felt that he was personally responsible, before AUah,
for everything that happened in the Islamic state, even the widows in
Iraq and even the livestock.
Once lands had been conquered, that was not the end of the
matter. Unlike the old Bedouin approach of attack and retreat,
'Umar's method was far more strategic. He took care to ensure that
the new lands were incorporated fully into the Islamic state and that
the message of Islam was spread to their people. Thus he established
new cities, as military bases but also as centres of l e m g and
da'wah. Their fair treatment of the non-Muslims who came under
their rule also contributed to their success. The vassal peoples of the
old Roman empire welcomed the newcomers who treated them with
mercy and justice. When the Muslims found themselves unable to
defend the people of Homs in accordance with the terms of their
treaty, they returned their Jizyah to them, and the people of Homs
looked forward to the day when the Muslims would return to rule
their city again. This approach won the he& of many who embraced
Islam willingly.
It is worth noting that most, if not all, of the lands which 'Umar
won for Islam with this approach are still Muslim today, and are
mostly Arabic-speaking.

26

Translatork Foreword

Along with the other Sahibah, 'Umar did not let victory make

h i become proud or arrogant. They believed that victory came only
fiom Allah and that their duty was to put their trust in Him and give
thanks to Him.
As well as the numerous practical examples of leadership that
are given, this book presents us with an important lesson which all
Muslims need to grasp, which is that the Ummah's strength does not
lie in money, natural resources or numbers -we have all of these in
abundance today, whereas the ummah at the time of 'Umar had very
little of any of them. The source of the ummah's strength lies in Islam
and in its adherence to the way of the Qur'an and Sunnah. Having
tried all the "isms" and ideologies of the last century or two, which
have all failed and have led only to an increase in the human misery
of the Ummah, it is time to recognize that we have no choice but to
return to Islam and take it seriously, as the Sahribah did.
May Allah reward the author for his extensive research and for
presenting such important information to the Ummah, lessons which
we have never needed to learn more than we do now.

Introduction

Acknowledgements regarding the writing of this book go first
of all to Allah, may He be exalted and glorified, then to a good group
of scholars, shaykhs and di'iyahs who encouraged me to go ahead
and study the era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs (al-Khulafa' arRGhideen). One of them said to me that there is a gap between the
Muslims and that period, and there is confusion with regard to
priorities. Many of the Muslims are better acquainted with the lives
of the di'iyahs, scholars and reformers than with the lives of the
Rightly-Guided Caliphs, but that era is rich in lessons about the
political, educational, media, moral, economic, intellectual, jihadi
and fiqhi aspects of Islam, of which we are in the greatest need. We
need to study the institutions of the Islamic state and how they
developed as time went by, such as the judiciary and financial
institutions, the caliphate system, the military institutions, the way in
which governors were appointed and the process of ijtihad which
took place at that time when the Muslim ummah came into contact
with the Persian and Byzantine civilizations, and the progress of the
Islamic conquests.
This book began as an idea which Allah willed should become
reality. Allah took me by the hand and smoothed the way and made
things easy for me. He helped me to find the references and sources,
and praise is due to Allah for helping me to do that.
The history of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs is full of lessons
which are scattered throughout the books and sources, whether they
have to do with history, hadith, fiqh, literature, tafeer, or biographies
and evaluations of narrators. I began to study them as I was able to,
and I found therein abundant historical material which is difficult to
find in the well known history books that are currently in circulation.
I compiled this material, organized it, examined it and analyzed it.

By the grace of Allah, this book was widely distributed in the
Arabic bookstores and international book fairs. It reached many
readers, d i 'iyahs, scholars and seekers of knowledge, as well as the
general Muslim public. They encouraged me to continue studying the
history of the Rightly Guided Caliphs, and to try to simplify it and
make it accessible to the urnmah in a style that is more suited for
modem times.
The history of the Rightly Guided Caliphs is filled with
lessons. If we present them properly and avoid the weak and
fabricated narrations, and the books of the Orientalists and their
lackeys among the secularists and Rifidis and their ilk, and follow
the methodology ofAhl as-Sunnah, then we will have contributed to
the presentation of history according to the view of Ah1 as-Sunnah
wa al-Jam6 'ah, as well as having come to know more about the life
and times of those concerning whom Allah (&) said:
dAnd the foremost to embrace Islam of the Muhdjiroon and the Ansir
and also those who followed them exactly [in Faith]. Allah is wellpleased with them as they are well-pleased with Him. He has
prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow paradise], to

Introduction

And 'Abdullih ibn Mas'ood (4)
said concerning them:
"Whoever would like to follow the way of someone, let him follow
the way of those who have died, for those who are still living are not
safe kom fimah."
Such were the Companions of Muhammad @J, who were, by
Allah, the best of this ummah, the most sincere, the most
knowledgeable and the least pretentious. They were the people
whom Allah chose to accompany His Prophet and establish His
religion, so we must acknowledge their virtue and follow in their
footsteps, adhering as much as possible to their example of morality
and religious commitment, for they followed true guidance.' The
Sahhbah applied the rulings of Islam and spread Islam east and west.
Their era was the best of eras, for they were the ones who taught the
ummah the Qur'an and narrated the Sunnabs and reports kom the
Messenger of Allah @
- J. Their history is a storehouse of the
ummah's treasures: thought, culture, knowledge, jihad, conquests
and dealings with other peoples and nations. In this glorious history,
subsequent generations find that which will help them to direct their
affairs in life according to the right way and sound guidance, and to
understand the true nature of their message and their role in this
world. From that era they can derive that which will nourish their
souls, discipline their hearts and enlighten their minds. It will
motivate them, teach them lessons and help their ideas to mature.
Dh 'iyahs, scholars, shaykhs and all members of the ummah will fmd
therein that which will help them to prepare the new generation of
Muslims and raise them according to the Prophet's way. They will
become acquainted with the main features of the Rightly-Guided
Caliphate and the attributes of its leaders and the people, and the
reasons for its demise.

This second book about the era of the Rightly Guided Caliphs
speaks of al-F2rooq 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb, his personality and his era.
He was the second caliph and the best of the noble Sahribah after Abu
Bakr as-Siddeeq (may Allah be pleased with them both). The
Messenger of Allah (&) encouraged us and commanded us to follow

their path and their guidance. The Messenger of AUah

Caliphs after me.r3

'Umar (&) was the best of the righteous after the Prophets
and Messengers and Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq (&). The Messenger of
AUah (#J said of them both: (gallow the example of the two who
come after me, Abu Bakr and mar.^^ There are many well-known
ahrideeth - hadiths - and reports which speak of the virtues of
'Umar (&). The Messenger of Allah (g)
said: ((Amongthe nations
who came before you were some who were inspired If anyone
among my -ah
were to be inspired it would be mar.))^

And the Messenger of Allah (g)
- said: ((Whilst I was sleeping, I saw
myself drawing water from a well with a bucket. Abu Bakr came and
drew a bucket or two weakly. May Allah forgive him.6 Then 'Umar
ibn al-KhaMb came and the bucket turned into a very large one m his
hands. I had never seen any one so strong doing this task, all the
people drank their fill and watered their camels that knelt down
there.))'

Introduction

'Amr ibn al-'As (&) said: ctI said: "0'Messenger of Allah,
which of the people is most beloved to you?" He said, " 'kishah." I
said, "0'Messenger of Allah, who among men? He said, "Her
father." I said, "Then who?" He said, "Umar ibn al-Khagb," then
he named some other men.))'
The life of al-Firooq 'Umar ibn al-Khagb (&) is a shining
page of Islamic history, which outshines and supercedes all other
histories. The history of all nations put together does not contain even
a part of what his life contained of noble conduct, glory, sincerity,
jihad and calling others for the sake of Allah. So I began to study his
life and times in the reference books and sources, and I analyzed it,
verified it and put it in order so that it would become accessible to the
di'iyahs, khateebs, scholars, politicians, thinkers, military
commanders and rulers of the ummah, as well as the seekers of
knowledge and the general public, so that they may benefit from it in
their lives by following his example, and that Allah may bestow upon
them success in this world and in the Hereafter.
I studied the life of 'Umar h m his birth until his martyrdom.
In this book I discuss his lineage, his family and his life during the
Jehiliyah, as well as his becoming Muslim and his migration
(hijrah), the effect that the Holy Qur'an and his keeping company
had on training him and forming his Islamic
with the Prophet
personality. I discuss the role he played in military campaigns and in
the society of Madeenah during the lifetime of the Prophet &) and
of Abu Balcr q-Siddeeq (&). I describe how he was appointed as
caliph and explain the foundations of his way of ruling, such as
shoora (consultation), establishing justice and equality among
people, and his respect for personal keedom. I point out the most
important characteristics of 'Umar, his family life, his respect for Ah1

a)

AI-Ikdnfee Saheeh Ibn Hibbrin, 151309.

'Umar ibn al-Khattib

33

al-Bayt, and his life in society after he became the caliph of the
Muslims, how he took care of the women of that society, how he
showed respect for people who were known for their virtue and good
works, how he was keen to meet the needs of the people, how he
trained some of the leaders of society, how he denounced some of
those who were deviant in their behaviour, how he was concerned
about the health of his people, how he set up a system to check on
what was happening in the marketplace, how he was keen to attain
the goals of shari'ah in society by defending the concept of Tawheed
and fighting deviation and innovation (bid 'ah),his concern regarding
acts of worship and how he protected the honour of the Mujihideen.

I also discuss 'Umar's deep concern for knowledge, how he
kept an eye on the people by teaching them and guiding them in
Madeenah, and how he made Madeenah a centre forfatwas and fiqh,
how he made it into a school which produced scholars, drE 'iyahs,
governors and qwis. I describe 'Umar's influence on the schools of
thought in other regions, such as the schools of Makkah, Madeenah,
Ba~ra,Koofah, Syria and Egypt. 'Umar took care to prepare
specialized scholars whom he sent out to the regions. As the
conquests spread, he taught commanders and governors to establish
mosques in the conqnered lands that would become centres of
da'wah and teaching and spreading Islamic civilization. These
mosques were the k t educational institutions in Islam, through
which the scholars among the Sahibah began to teach the people
who had recently entered Islam voluntarily, with no force or pressure.
The number of mosques in which Jumu 'ah prayers were offered in
'Umar's state reached twelve thousand. The educational institutions
which were established in the wake of the army that conquered Iraq,
Iran, Syria, Egypt and North Afiica were led by distinguished
scholars, faqeehs and d&'iyahs who had learned at the hands of the
in Madeenah. 'Umar made use of these
Messenger of Allah

a)

resources and directed them properly, producing the scholars and
faqeehs who kept pace with the conquering m y .
I also discuss 'Umar's interest in poetry and poets. 'Umar was
the most interested of the Rightly Guided Caliphs in poetry, which he
would listen to and appreciate. He was also the most likely to quote
suitable poetry on all occasious, so much so that it was said that there
was no incident that 'Umar ibn al-Khagih came across, but he would
say a line ofverse that was appropriate to the occasion. He was also a
brilliant literary critic. He had standards to which he would refer
when he decided which text was better than another, or which poet
was better than another. These standards included correct usage of
Arabic language, use of normal words and phrases, avoidance of
complex and weird phrases, clanty and straightforwardness, use of
words that fit the meaning, use of beautiful words in the proper
context, and proper rhythm. He used to forbid poets to lampoon
others or say anything that went against the aims of shari'ah. He
would use different methods of disciplining them. For example, he
bought the honour of the Muslims by paying al-Huwy'ah three
thousand dirhams (to stop composing verse that offended the
Muslims).

I also discuss the development of construction and crisis
management during the time of 'Umar. He took an interest in roads
and means of transportation on land and sea. He established border
posts and cities as mlitary bases and centres of civilization. I discuss
the establishment of major cities, such as Basra, Koofah, al-Fus&
and Sirt, at the time of 'Umar, as well as the military and economic
considerations which he took into account when establishing cities.
I also discuss the methods followed by 'Umar when he was
faced with the Year of ar-Ramidah (a year of famine), and how he
himself set an example for the people and sought the help of Allah. I
describe the refugee camps that he set up during that year, and how he

'Umar ibn al-Kha@b

35

asked the people of other regions for aid, how he prayed for rain, and
some of the cases of ijtihad that came up during the year of arR a m W , such as the suspension of the hadd punishment for
stealing, and the postponement of paying zakah during that year.
I also describe the year of the plague, and how 'Umar dealt
with this epidemic, which led to the death of the senior commanders
of the Muslim army in Syria. More than twenty thousand Muslims
died of the plague and things went out of control because their estates
were not being distributed. 'Umar went to Syria and distributed
provisions, and set up troops to patrol the border during the winter
and the summer. He protected the borders of Syria, appointed
governors and organized the affairs of the army, commanders and
common folk, and distributed the estates of the dead among the
living.
I explain the role that 'Umar played in the development of
fmancial and judiciary institutions. I speak of the financial
institutions and the sources of the state's income at the time of 'Umar
(&), such as zakah, jizyah, kharij, 'ushoor and booty. I discuss the
bayt al-mil (treasury) of the Muslims and the establishment of
ministries, the expenditure of the state at the time of 'Umar, his
ijtihad concerning ard al-khariij (conquered land) and his issuing an
Islamic currency. I describe the role that 'Umar played in the
development of judiciary institutions, the most important letters that
'Umar sent to judges, how he appointed judges, their salaries,
qualifications and duties, the sources of judiciaq rulings, the
evidence followed by judges, and the rulings passed by 'Umar on the
basis of ijtihad, such as his ruling on forging the official seal of the
state, on the man who stole *om the bayt al-mil in Koofah, the man
who was unaware that zini is hariim, and other rulings.
- I also discuss
'Umar's fiqh in dealing with govemors, and I mention the regions of
the Islamic state at the time of 'Umar and the names of the governors

36

Introduction

of those regions at his time. And I describe the most important
guidelines followed by 'Umar in appointing governors, the
conditions that he stipulated for them, the characteristics of 'Umar's
governors, the nghts and duties of the govemors, how 'Umar
checked on the governors and brought them to account, how he
handled complaints from the people against governors, and the h d s
ofpunishment that he carried out on govemors. I also tell the story of
how he dismissed Kh%d ibn al-Waleed (&) on two occasions, the
main reasons for dismissing him, the attitude of the Muslim society
towards this dismissal, the reaction of Kh2lid ibn al-Waleed to this
decision, and what he said about 'Umar when he was on his
deathbed.
I also describe the conquests of Iraq, Iran,Syria, Egypt and
Libya during the time of 'Umar, and the lessons that we can learn
from these conquests. I shed some light on the correspondence that
took place between 'Umar and the leaders of his army, from which
may be denved educat~onalmaterial which deals with directing
people and establishing states, guiding societies and leaders, and the
art of war. From the letters of 'Umar to the commanders I have also
denved information on duties owed to Allah, such as bemg steadfast
when facing the enemy, fighting them with the intention of
supporting the religion of Allah and fnlfillmg the trust, and not being
biased when supportmg the religion of Allah. I also derived
~nformationon duties owed to commanders, such as always obeying
them and following their commands, and the duties owed to soldiers,
such as checking on them, being kind to them during campaigns,
encouraging them to fight, etc.
I also discuss the relationship between 'Umar and kings of
other lands, the results of 'Umar's conquests, and the final days of his
life, and his concept of meeting Allah, which dominated his thoughts
and became deeply rooted in his heart from the time he became

'Umar ibn al-Khaftrib

37

Muslim until he was martyred. In this book, I try to explain how
'Umar understood Islam and how he lived in this world, and how he
influenced the course of events during his lifetime. I discuss the
various aspects of his personality, political, military, administrative
and judicial, and his life in society when he was one of the ordinary
people and after he was appointed as caliph after the death of Abu
Bakr. I also focus on his role in the development of financial,judicial,
administrative and military institutions.
This book proves the greatness of 'Umar and confirms to the
reader that his faith, knowledge, intellect, eloquence, attitude and
influence were all great. 'Umar represented greatness in all its
aspects, and his greatness was based on his understanding and
application of Islam and his strong relationship with Allah and his
following the guidance of the Messenger

a).

'Umar was a leader who guided people in the right direction
and whose example was followed by others in word and deed. His
life is one of the soundest sources of faith, motivation and correct
understanding of Islam. How great is the Muslim ummah's need for
men of sound caliber who follow the example of the noble Sahibah
(Companions of the last Prophet) and embody the sublime teachings
of Islam, bringjng it to life by means of sacrifices that the people can
see. The history of the Rightly Guided Caliphs and the noble
Sahibah is a constant reminder to the ummah through all
generations, and the way to benefit fiom this reminder is for great
people of the modem age to follow the example of these great leaders
and put it into practice in modem circumstances so that no one will
think that these lessons were only suited to a certain age and that to
repeat this achievement requires an environment similar to theirs.
The facts indicate that every time the motivation of faith and the
concept of meeting Allah grows stronger, and the Muslims become
keener to base their actions on these ideas, then Allah, the Exalted,

38

Introduction

Almighty, grants victory to His close fiends and directs
circumstances to serve their interests.

I have striven to study the personality and era of 'Umar to the
best of my ability, without claiming to be infallible or kee kom error.
I seek nothing but the pleasure and reward of Allah, and He is the
One Whose help I seek to achieve that. I ask Him to make this book
of benefit, for He is the One with the most sublime names and the
One Who hears all prayers.
I completed this book on Wednesday 13 R a m a a 1422 A.H. /
28 November 2001, at 7.05 am. All praise be to Allah, fmt and last. I
ask Him, may He be glorified and exalted, to accept this work, to
open people's hearts that they might benefit kom it, and to bless it by
His generosity and bounty. Allah (&) says:
(Whatever of mercy [i.e. of good], Allah may grant to mankind, none
can withhold it; and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it
thereafter. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.) (Qurhn 35: 2)
In conclusion, I can only stand before Allah with a humble
heart, acknowledging His bounty, kindness and grace, for He is the
most Generous, the Helper, the Source of strength. To Hnn be praise
for the blesslugs that He has bestowed upon me. I ask Him by His
most beautiful names and His sublime attributes to make my effort
solely for His sake and to make it of benefit to HIS slaves. May He
grant me reward for every letter I have written and add them to the
balance of my good deeds. May He reward my brothers who helped
me as much as they could to complete this humble effort. I hope that
every Muslm who reads this book wlll not forget to make du '6'for
the slave who is in need of his Lord's forgiveness, mercy and
pleasure. AUah says:

d... My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful

39

for Your Favours which You have bestowed on me and on my
parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds that will please You,
and admit me by Your Mercy among Your righteous s1aves.B
(Qur'an 27: 19)

Glo~yand praise be to You, 0' Allah.I bear witness that there
is no god but You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You. And
the end of om supplication is: "Praise be to AUah, the Lord of the
Worlds."

1.2. His birth and physical characteristics
'Umar was born thirteen years after the Year of the ~ l e ~ h a n t . ~
With regard to his physical characteristics, he was white with a
reddish complexion, with handsome cheeks, nose and eyes, and large
hands and feet. He was muscular, tall, solid and bald. He was taller
than average, as if he was riding on a mount. He was very strong, not
weak or puny.8 He used to dye his hair with henna and the ends of his
moustache were long? When he walked, he walked quickly, when he
spoke, he spoke clearly, and when he stmck, he caused pain.10

1.3. His family
His father was al-Khagb ibn Nufayl. 'Umar's grandfather
Nufayl ibn 'Abdul-'Uzza was one of those to whom Quraysh used to
refer for judgement." His mother was Hantamah bint Hishim ibn alMugheerah, and it was said that she was the daughter of Hkhim and
the sister of Abu ~ah1.l' The view of most historians is that she was
the daughter of Hkhim and the paternal cousin of Abu Jahl ibn
~ i s h hl3.
With regard to his wives, sons and daughters: During the
Jrihiliyah, he married Zaynab bint Mamoon, the sister of 'Uthmk

him 'Ubaydull5h. He divorced her at al-Hudaybiyah, and after that
she married Abu al-Jahm ibn Hudhayfah. And he married Quraybah
bint Abi Umayyah al-Makhzoomi, and divorced her at alHudaybiyah, after that she married 'Abdur-Ra?mi?n ibn Abi Bakr.
And he married Umm Hakeem bint al-Hirith ibn Hishim, after her
husband 'lkrimah ibn Abi Jahl was killed in Syria.I4 She bore h i

her.I5 And he married ame eel ah'^ bint '&im ibu ThZbit ibu Abi alAql& of al-Aws. And he married '&ah

Nufayl, who had previously been married to 'Abdull5h ibn Abi
Bakr.17 When 'Umar was killed, az-Zubayr ibn a l - ' A w h (&)
married her and it was said that she was the mother of his son 'Iyw.
And Allah knows best.
He proposed marriage to Umm Kulthoom, the daughter of Abu
Bakr q-Siddeeq, when she was still young. He spoke to 'kishah (I$$,)
concerning her, but Umm Kulthoom said: "I have no need of h i . "
'kishah asked, "Are you rejecting the Arneer al-Mu'mineen?" She
said, "Yes, for he lives a rough life." 'kishah sent word to 'Amr ibn
al-'Av. who told 'Umar not to many her and suggested instead that he
many Umm Kulthoom bint 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib, whose mother was
F Z W , the daughter of the Messenger of Allah @), so she was
descended from the Messenger of Allah &). So he asked 'Ali for her
hand in marriage, and he married her to him. 'Umar gave her a dowry

'Umar in MaWcah

married Luhyah - a woman from Yemen - who bore him 'AbdurR b h the younger, and it was said, the middle one. Al-WSqidi
said: "She was an u m m walad (a concubine who bore her master a
child) and not a wife."lg They said: "He also had a concubine call
Fakeehah, who bore him Zaynab." Al-WSqidi said: "She was the
youngest of his ~hildren."~'
The total number of his children was thirteen. Their names
were: Zayd the elder, Zayd the younger, '&im, 'Abdullih, 'AhdurRthe elder, 'Abdu~-Ra!m& the middle one, ' A h d u r - R b h
the younger, 'Ubaydull&, 'IySa Hafsah, Ruqayyah, Zaynab and
Fitimah (may Allah be pleased with them all). The total number of
his wives whom he married during the Jihiliyah and in Islam, whom
he divorced or died and left behind, was seven." 'Umar manied in
order to produce offspring and have many children. He said: "I do not
come to women because of desire. Were it not for children, I would
not care if I never saw a woman with my own eyes."22 And he said:
"I force myself to have intercourse, hoping that Allah will hnng forth
from me a soul who will glorify and remember ~im."'~

1.4. His life during the Jihiliyah
'Umar spent half of his life in the Jdhiliyah, and grew up like
his peers of Quraysh, except that he had an advantage over them in
that he was one of those who had learned to read, of whom there were
very few.24 He bore responsibility at an early age, and had a very

harsh upbringing in which he knew no type of lwcwy or
manifestation of wealth. His father al-Khatj2b forced him to tend his
camels. His father's harsh treatment had a negative effect on 'Umar
which he remembered all his life. 'Abdur-Rb%n ihn Hitib spoke of
that and said: "I was with 'Umar ibn al-Khatj2b in ~ a j n i n " and he
said, 'I used to tend Oivestock) for al-Khatj2b in this place, and he
was very harsh. Sometimes I would tend (the livestock) and
sometimes I would gather firewood.' "26
This was a period of hardship during 'Umar's life, and he
would often remember it. Sa'd ibn al-Musayyab tells us: " 'Umar (&)
went for Hajj, and when he was in Dajniin he said, 'There is no god
but Allah, the Most High, the Most Great, the One Who gives
whatever He wills to whomever He wills. I used to tend the camels of
al-Khatj2b in this valley, wearing a woollen garment. He was harsh;
he would exhaust me when I worked and beat me if I fell short. And
now here I am, with no one between me and Allah.'"
The son of al-Khatjib did not tend livestock for his father only;
rather he used to tend the livestock of his maternal aunts of Banu
Makhzoom. This was narrated to us from 'Umar himself, when he
was pondering one day the fact that he had become the caliph, so who
could be better than him? In order to remind himself of what he was
-as he thought
he stood before the Muslims and announced that
he was no more than a shepherd, who used to tend the flocks of his
maternal aunts of Banu Makhzoom. Muhammad ibn 'Umar alMakhzoomi narrated that his father said: " 'Umar ibn al-Khatj2b (&)
called out that prayer was about to begin, and when the people had

gathered and said takbeer, he ascended the minbar and praised and
glorified Allah as He deserves, and sent blessings and peace upon His
Prophet, then he said: "0' people, I remember when I used to tend the
flocks of my maternal aunts of Banu Makhzoom, and they would
give me a handful of dates or raisins, which would be sufficient for
the day, and what a day that was!"
Then he came down, and ' A b d u r - w m ibn 'Awf said to
him: "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, all you did was to denigrate
yourself." He said, "Woe to you, 0' son of ' A d I was alone and I
started to tbink. I said to myself, 'You are the caliph, who is better
than you?' So I wanted to remind myselfofwhat I am." According to
another report: "I noticed something in myself, and I wanted to bring

constant work of 'Umar in Makkah, before he entered Islam, caused
him to acquire good characteristics, such as forbearance, patience and
toughness. But tending sheep was not the only work that the son of
al-KhaGb did during the ~ d h i l i ~ a From
h . ~ ~his early youth he also
excelled in all kinds of sports, such as wrestling, riding and
horsemanship. He enjoyed and narrated poet$9, and he was
interested in the history and affairs of his people. He was keen to
attend the great fairs of the Arabs, such as 'Ukk,Mijannah and Dhu
al-Ma@, where he would make the most of the opportunity to
engage in trade and learn the history of the Arabs, and the battles and
contests that had taken place among the tribes. These events were
dscussed in a literruy fashion by the masters of eloquence before the

prominent figures of the tribes, which meant that Arab history was
constantly being discussed and was unlikely to be forgotten.
Sometimes these literary contests would spark wars, and ' U k k itself
was a direct cause of four wars which were known as the wars of al~ijk?'
'Umar engaged in trade and profited, which made him one of
the rich men of Makkah. He became acquainted with many people in
the lands that he visited for the purpose of eade. He travelled to Syria
in the summer and Yemen in the winter.31 He occupied a prominent
position in Makkan society during the Jdhiliyah, and played an
effective role in shaping events. He was helped by the outstanding
history of his forefathers. His grandfather Nufayl ibn 'Abdul-'Uzza
was one to whom Quraysh referred their disputes for judgement3'
and his ancestor Ka'b ibn Lu'ayy was held in high esteem by the
Arabs. They had recorded their history from the year of his death
until the Year of the ~ l e ~ h a n t'Umar
. 3 ~ inherited this status ftom his
forefathers which brought him a great deal of knowledge about the
life and circumstances of the Arabs, in addition to his own smartness
and intelligence. So they would come to hlm to resolve their disputes.
Ibn Sa'd said: " 'Umar used to judge between the Arabs regarding
their disputes before slam."^^
'Umar (&) was wise, eloquent, well spoken, strong,
forbearing, noble, persuasive and clear of speech, which made him
qualified to be an ambassador for Quraysh, to speak up for them

'Umar in Malrkah

before the other tribes.35 Ibn al-Jawzi said: "The role of ambassador
fell to 'Umar ibn al-Khagb. If there was a war between Quraysh and
another tribe, they would send him as an ambassador, and if another
tribe was boasting against them, they would send him to respond in
kind, and they were pleased with him."36
He wed to defend all the traditions, acts of worship and
systems to which Quraysh were accustomed. His nature was one of
sincerity which led him to defend all that he believed in to the bitter
end. So 'Umar resisted Islam in the beginning, because he feared that
this new religion would shake the system that was well established in
Ma!&& and which gave M a a h a special status among the Arabs.
For it was the location of the House to whlch people came on
pilgrimage, which gave Quraysh a unique status among the Arabs,
and brought spiritual and material wealth to Makkah. This was the
reason for the city's prosperity and its people's wealth. So the rich
men of Makkah resisted this religion and persecuted the weak among
its converts, and 'Umar was at the forefront of those who persecuted
these weak ones.37
He kept on beating a slave woman who had become Muslim,
until his arms grew tired and the whip fell from his hand, then he
stopped to rest. Abu Bakr passed by and saw how the slave woman
was being tortured, so he bought her from him and set her free.38
'Umar lived during the Jihiliyah and knew it inside out. He
knew its true nature, its customs and traditions, and he defended it
with all the strength he possessed. Hence when he entered Islam, he
understood its beauty and trne nature, and he understood the great

difference between guidance and misguidance, disbelief (kufr) and
faith, truth and falsehood, and he spoke the famous words: "The
bonds of Islam will be undone one by one when there will be a
generation brought up in Islam who do not know what Jlihiliyah
is."39

2. His Becoming Muslim and Migrating

2.1. His becoming Muslim
The first ray of the light of faith that touched his heart came on
the day when he saw the women of Quraysh leaving their homeland
and travelling to a distant land because of the persecution that they
were facing from him and others like him. His conscience was
stirred; he felt remorse and pity for them, and he spoke kind words to
them which they had never expected to hear fiom someone like
him.40

Umm 'Abdulliih bint Hantamah said: "When we were
travelling, migrating to Abyssinia, 'Umar, who used to persecute us
mercilessly, came and stood over me and said to me, 'Are you
leaving, 0' Umm 'Abdulla?' I said, 'Yes, you have persecuted us
and oppressed us, and by Allah we are going out in the land of Allah
until Allah grants us a way out.' 'Umar said, 'May Allah be with
you.' And I saw kindness in him that I had never seen before. When
' h i r ibn Rabee'ah, who had gone out on some errand, came, I told
him about that and he asked, 'It seems that you hope 'Umar will
become Muslim?' I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'He will not become Muslim

1

50

'Umar in MaWrah

until al-Khagb's donkey becomes Muslim!' "4'
'Umar was moved by this woman's attitude and he felt
distressed. How much suffering the followers of this new religion
were putting up with, but despite that they were standing tirm. What
was the secret behind this extraordinary strength? He felt sad and his
he& was filled with pain.42
Shortly after this incident, 'Urnar became Muslim because of
the du 'd ' of the Messenger of Allah &), which was the main reason
for his becoming Muslim. He had prayed for him, saying: ctO' Allah,
support Islam with the more beloved of these two men to You: Abu
Jahl ibn H i s h h or 'Umar ibn al-Khagb.,) And the more beloved of
them to Him was mar?^ Allah created the circumstances that led
'Umar to Islam. It was narrated that 'Abdull2h ibn 'Umar (&,) said:
"I never heard 'Umar saying about something that he thought it
would be so-and-so, but it turned out as he said. Once, while 'Umar
was sitting, a handsome man passed by him, 'Umar said, 'If I am not
mistaken, this man is still following the religion of Jdhiliyah, or he
was their soothsayer. Call the man to me.' When the man was called
to him,he told him what he was thinking. The man said, 'I have never
seen a day such as this, on which a Muslim is faced with such an
accusation.' 'Umar said, 'I am determined that you should tell me the
bmth.' He said, 'I was a soothsayer during the Jdhiliyah.' 'Umar said,
'What was the most astonishing thing that your female Jinn told you
of?' He said, 'One day while I was in the market, she came to me
scared and said, 'Haven't you seen the J m s and their despair, and

they were overthrown aRer their defeat (and prevented fiom listening
to the news fiom heaven) so that they (stopped going to heaven and)
kept following the camel-riders (i.e. the Arabs)?" 'Umar said, 'He is
speaking the truth. One day while I was sleeping near their idols, a
man brought a calf and sacrificed it (to the idols). An (unseen)
creature shouted at him, and I have never heard anything harsher than
his voice. He was crying, '0' you bold evil-doer! A matter of
success!' An eloquent man is saying, 'There is no god but Allah.'
Shortly thereafter it was said that a Prophet had appeared.'''44
Many reports have been narrated concerning the reason why
'Umar (&) became Muslim, but when we e x m e their isnads
according to the standards of the science of hadith, we see that most
of them are not sound.45From the reports which are narrated in the
books of S e w a h and history we may divide the story of his becoming
Muslim and his public announcement of his conversion into two
topics, as follows:

2.1.1. His determination to kill the
Messenger of Allah (g)

do it." They said: "You can do it, 0' 'Umar!" So he went out at
midday on a very hot day, with his sword by his side, looking for the
Messenger of Allah @) and a group of his Companions, namely
Abu Bakr, 'Ali and Hamzah, among the Muslim men who had stayed
with the Messenger of Allah @) and had not migrated with those
who migrated to Abyssinia. He was told that they had gathered in Dir
al-Arqam at the foot of as-Safa. He was met by Nu'aym ihn

'Abdullih an-Na&k who said: "Where are you headed, 0' 'Umar? "
He said: "I am looking for this sibi' (this one who has changed his
religion), who has divided Quraysh, insulted their intelligence,
criticized their religion and slandered their gods. I am going to kill
him." Nu'aym said to him: "What a bad course you have taken, 0'
'Umar. By Allah, you are fooling yourself, and have become
careless, and you are going to be the cause of Banu 'Adiyy's doom.
Do you think that Banu 'Abd Manx will leave you walking on the
face of the earth after you kill Muhammad?" They argued until their
voices became loud, then 'Umar said: "I think that you have changed
your religion (i.e., become Muslim). If I find that to be true, I will
start with you." When an-Nabiim realized that he could not stop
him, he said: "I tell you that your family and the family of your
brother-in-law have become Muslim and have forsaken you and the
misguidance that you follow." When he heard what he said, he
asked, "Which of them?" He said, "Your brother-in-law, your
paternal cousin and your sister."46

2.1.2. Umafs raid on his sister's house and
the steadfastness of Fstirnah bint al-Kha&?ib
before her brother
When 'Umar heard that his sister and her husband had become
Muslim, anger overtook him and he went to them. When he knocked
at the door they said, "Who is it?" He said, "The son of al-Khagb."
They were reading a paper that was in their hands, but when they
realized that 'Umar was there, they rushed to hide and they left the
paper where it was. When he came in and his sister saw him, she
recognized the evil intent that was on his face, so she hid the paper

beneath her leg. He said: "What is this muttering and whispering that
I heard in your house?" For they had been reading .Soorah
Ta-Hi.
Tky~.s,+id:'We were just talking a m o n g s z l v e s . " He sad:
"Perhaps you have changed your religion?" His brother-in-law said:
"0' '~mar,"'whatif the truth w&e in something other than your
religion?" 'Umar attacked his brother-in-law Sa'eed, pulling his
beard, and they wrestled. 'Umar was very stiong, and he threw
Sa'eed to the ground and jumped on him, then sat on his chest. His
sister came to her husband's defence, but he pushed her away with his
hand, and her face started to bleed. She said angrily: "0' enemy of
Allah, are you hitting me because I believe in Allah alone?" He said,
"Yes." She said: "Do what you like. I bear witness that there is no
god except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. We
havebecome Muslim whether you like it or not." When 'Umar heard
that, he regretted what he had done. He got up off his brother-in-law
and sat down, then he said, "Give me this paper that you have." She
said: "I will not do that." He said, "Woe to you! What you said
moved me. Give it to me so that I may look at it. I give you my
solemn word that I will not betray you; you can take it back and put it
wherever you want." She said: "You are unclean, and (I...none can
touch [it] but the
(Qur'an 56: 79). Get up and wash
yourself." So 'Umar went out and washed himself, then he came
back to his sister and she gave the paper to him, on which was written
Soorah Ta-Hi and some other soorahs. He saw on it the words,
Bismill6h ir-Rahmrin ir-Raheem (in the name of Allah, the Most
Gracious, the Most Merciful). When he read the words ar-Rahmin
ar-Raheem, he was alarmed and threw the page down, then he
regained control of himself, picked it up again, and saw the words:
(ITa-Hi [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur'an, and none
but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.]. We have not sent down
the Qur'an unto you [O' Muhammad] to cause you distress, but only

as a Reminder to those who fear [Allah]. A Revelation from Him
[Allah] Who has created the earth and high heavens. The Most
Gracious [Allah] rose over [Istawri] the [Mighty] Throne [in a
manner that suits His Majesty]. To Him belongs all that is in the
heavens and all that is on the earth, and all that is between them, and
all that is under the soil. And if you [O' Muhammad] speak [the
invocation] aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is
yet more bidden. Allah! Lri ilriha illa Huwa [none has the right to be
worshipped but He]! To Him belong the Best Names.)
(Qur 'an 20: 1-8)
He felt great respect for it and said: "Is this what Quraysh is
running from?" Then he read some more, and when he reached the
words,
(Verily, I am Allah! Lri ikiha illa Ana [none has the right to be
worshipped but so worship Me, and perform as-SaZrih [Iqiimat aySalrih] for My remembrance. Verily, the Hour is coming - and I am

he strives. Therefore, let not the one who believes not therein [i.e. in
the Day of Resurrection, Reckoning, Paradise and Hell], but follows
his own lusts, divert you therefrom, lest you perish.#

- he said, "The One Who says this, no one should be worshipped

other than Him. Tell me where Muhammad is."47

2.1.3. 'Umar goes to the Messenger of Allah (g)
and declares his Islam
When Khabbgb (&) heard that, he came out of the house where he had been hiding -and said: "Be of good cheer, 0' 'Umar,

which he spoke on Monday: ((0'Allah, support Islam

ibn Hishim or 'Umar ibn al-~hatJib.))"~~

a)

He said: "Tell me where the Messenger of Allah is." When
they realized that he was sincere, they said: "He is at the foot of mSafa." 'Umar took his sword and carried it by his side, then he went
to where the Messenger of Allah
and his Companions were and
hocked at the door. When they heard his voice they got scared, and
no one dared to open the door to him, because they knew of his harsh
views concerning the Messenger of Allah @J. When Hamzah saw
that the people were scared, he said, "What is the matter with you?"
They said: "It is 'Umar ibn al-Khash." He said: "Umar ibn alKhatJSb? Open the door for him! If Allah wants good for him, he will
become Muslim, and if He wants something other than that, then it
will be easy for us to kill him." So they opened the door, and H m a h

Messenger of Allah &), who said: {(Lethim go.49The Messenger of

2.1.4. 'Urnar's keenness to call people
to Islam publicly and to put up
with hardship for that purpose

'Umar entered Islam with deep sincerity, and he strove to
support Islam with all the strength he had been given. He said to the
Messenger of Allah
(("0'Messenger of Allah, are we not
following the truth whether we live or die?" The Messenger of Allah
@) said, "Yes, indeed. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, you
are following the truth, whether you live or die." He said: "So why
should we hide? By the One Who sent you with the truth, yon should
go out (and preach openly).")) It seems that the' Messenger of Allah
@) was also of the view that the time had come to preach his
message openly, and that the da'wah had become strong enough to
defend itself. So he gave permission to proclaim Islam openly. The
Messenger of AUah @) went out leading two columns, with 'Umar
at the head of one and Hamzah at the head of the other, stirring up
dust, until they entered the mosque. Quraysh looked at 'Umar and
Hamzah, and felt distressed as never before. On that day the

'Umar ibn al-KhaE2b challenged the mushrikeen of Quraysh,
and fought them until he was able to pray at the ~ a ' b a h and
~ ~ ,the
Muslims prayed with him. 'Umar was keen to annoy the enemies of
Islam as much as he could. He himself told the story of that, as he
said:
"I used not to be able to bear to see a Muslim man. I went to my
maternal uncle Abu Jahl -who was of noble status among them and knocked at his door. He said, 'Who is it?' I said, 'The son of alKhagb.' He came out to me, and I said, 'Have you heard that I have
changed my rel~gion?'He said, 'Have you?' I said, 'Yes.' He said,
'Don't do that.' I said, 'Yes, (I
have done it).' He said, 'Don't do
that,' then he went inside and slammed the door in my face and leR
me there. I said, 'It doesn't maw.' Then I went to one of the
noblemen of Quraysh andknocked at his door. He said, 'Who is it?' I
said, 'The son of al-Khagb.' He came out to me, and I said, 'Do you
realize that I have changed my religion?' He said, 'Have you?' I said,
'Yes.' He said, 'Don't do that.' Then he went inside and slammed the
door in my face. I said, 'It doesn't matter.' A man said to me, 'Do you
want people to know about your becoming Muslim?' I said, 'Yes.'
He said, 'When the people gather in al-wjr, you should go to this
man sit beside him, and say,
'Do you know that I have changed my religion?' So I did that, and he
stood up and shouted at the top of his voice, 'The son of al-Kha@b
has changed his religion!' The people jumped on me and started
hitting me, and I was hitting them back."54
According to a report narrated by 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar (&):
When 'Umar became Muslim, Quraysh did not know of that. He
sald: "Who among the people of MaMcah is most likely to tell others

58

'Umar in MaRRah

of what he hears?" It was said to him: "Jameel ibn Mu'arnmar alJum*."
So he went out to him, and I followed him to see what he
was doing. I was a young boy but I understood everything I saw and
beard. He went to him and said, "0' J q e e l , I have become Muslim."
By Allah, he did not answer him, but he got up, dragging his
garment, and 'Umar followed him and I followed my father. He went
and stood at the door of the mosque and yelled at the top of his voice:
"0' Quraysb!" - for they were gathered around the Ka'bah - "
'Umar ibn al-Khaflib has apostatized!" 'Umar said from behind him,
"He is lying. Rather I have become Muslim and I bear witness that
there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and
-- leapt on 'Utbah ibn
Messenger." They attacked him, but 'Umar
&bee'& and sat on him; be started to beat him and poke his fingers
in his eyes, and '~tbah'started screaming. Then the people kept away
from him. 'Umar stood up and went around to all the places where he
used to sit with people when he had been a disbeliever, and openly
declared his slam.^^ He kept fighting them until the sun reached its
zenith, and 'Umar got tired and sat down. They gathered around him
and he said: "What do you want?" Whilst they were like that, there
came a man who was wearing a silken huilah (suit) and an
embroidered shirt. He said: "What is the matter with you?" They
said: "The son of al-KhaGb has changed his religion." He said: "So
what? A man can chose a religion for himself. Do you think that
Banu 'Adiyy will let yon get away with it if yon kill their
companion?" So they dispersed. I [Ibn 'Umar] said to him in
Madeenah: "0' my father, who was the man who turned the people
back from you that day?" He said: "0' my son, that was al-'AS ibn

Wi'il as- ahm mi."^^

2.1.5. The effect of his becoming Muslim on the da'wah
'Abdull& ibn Mas'ood said: "We felt a sense of pride when
' U r n became Muslim, for we could not circumambulate the House

fought them until they left us alone. Then we prayed and

Suhayb ibn Sinh said: "When 'Umar ibn al-Khat$b became
Muslim, Islam came out into the open and the call to Islam was made
in public. We sat around the Ka'bah in circles, and we
circumambulated the House and settled our scores with those who
had persecuted us. We started to hit back."59

2.1.6. The date when 'Umar became Muslim, and the
number of Muslims at the time of his conversion

numbered thirty-nine. 'Umar said: "I remember that when I became

religion to prevail and granted glory to Islam.

'Umar in MaWtah

It was narrated that they numbered forty or forty-odd men and
eleven women, but 'Umar did not know them all, because most of
those who became Muslim concealed their Islam out of fear of the
mushrikeen, especially 'Umar, for he was very harsh towards them.
So he said that he brought the number to forty. He did not mention the
women because they had no power and were weak.62

2.2. His migration e j r a h )
When 'Umar decided to migrate to Madeenah, he insisted on
doing so openly. Ibn 'Abbb (4)
said: " 'Ali ibn Abi T3ib said to
me, 'I do not know of any of the Muhdjiireen who did not migrate in
secret, except 'Umar ibn al-Khasb. When he decided to migrate, he
put on his sword, put his bow over his shoulder, picked up his arrows
and carried his stick by his side. He went out to the Ka'bah, where a
number of Quraysh were gathered in its courtyard, and
circumambulated the House seven tnnes, at a leisurely pace.
Then he went to the Maqdm and prayed at a leisurely pace. Then he
went to the circles of people, one by one, and said to them, 'May your
faces become ugly! AUah will only rub these noses in the dust.
Whoever wants his mother to be bereft of him and his children to
become orphans or his wife to become a widow, let him meet me
behind this valley.' 'Ali said, 'No one followed him except a few of
those who were weak and oppressed. He taught them and told them
about Islam, then he went on his way."'63
'Umar went to Madeenah before the Messenger of Allah @)
did. He was accompanied by some of his family members and his
people: his brother Zayd ibn al-Khasb; 'Amr and 'Abdullih the

Zayd -who was one of the ten who were given the glad tidings of
Paradise; Wiqid ibn 'Abdullih at-Tameemi, one of their allies;
Khawla ibn Abi Khawla and M2lik ibn Abi Khawla - who were
also allies of theirs from Banu 'Ajil and Banu al-Bukayr; and Iyis,
Khiilid, 'Aqil and '&nu, who were allies kom Banu Sa'd ibn Layth.
They stayed with R i a a h ibn 'Abdul-Mundhir, among Banu 'Amr

Al-Bara' ibn ' L i b (&) said: "The first ones who came to us
were M y c a bibn 'Umayr &d Ibn Abi Ma!doom. They used to teach
the people Qur'an. Then Biliil, Sa'd and 'Amm& ibn Y%ir came,

the Prophet
Then the Prophet

people of Madeenah rejoice over anything as much as they rejoiced

Thus 'Umar ibn al-Khatjiib continued to serve his faith in word
and deed, never fearing the blame of the blamers for the sake of Allah
(cf. Qur'an 5: 54). He offered support and help to those Muslims in
Makkah who wanted to migrate, until he himself left, accompanied
by this large number of his relatives and allies. 'Umar helped others
among his companions who wanted to migrate, if he feared that they
would be persecuted and would

We said, 'If one of us does not make it there, it

succumbed.69When we reached Madeenah, we stayed among Banu

Hishim came to see 'Ayykh ibn Abi Rabee'ah, who was their
paternal cousin and their half-brother through their mother. They
came to us in Madeenah when the Messenger of Allah @) was still
in Makkah. They spoke to us and said, 'Your mother has vowed that
no comb will touch her head until she sees you, and she will not seek
shade kom the sun until she sees you.' He felt sorry for her, but I said
to him, '0' 'Ayyish, by Allah, allthe people want to do is to lead you
astray kom your religion, so beware of them. By Allah, if lice bother
your mother she will comb her hair, and if the heat of Makkah
becomes unbearable for her she will seek shade.' He said, 'I would
rather respect the oath of my mother, and I have some wealth there
which I am going to take.: I said, 'By AUah, you know that I am one
of the wealthiest men of Qhaysh. I will give you half of my wealth,
just do not go with them.' But he insisted on going with them, and
when he insisted I said, 'If you insist on doing that, then take this shecamel of mine, for she is well-trained and easy to ride. Stay on her
back, and if you suspect that they are up to something, you can flee
on her.' So he went out with them, riding that camel. Then when they
had travelled partway, Abu Jahl said to him, '0' my brother, by
Allah, I feel uncomfortable on this camel of mine; may I ride behind

h e e l down, so that he could climb up behind him, but when they
were both on the ground, they pounced on him and hed him up, then
they took him to Makkah where they put him to trial, and he
succumbed.70We used to say that Allah would not accept any good
deed or repentance from one who succumbed, one who had come to
know Allah then went back to kufr because of some trial that befell
hun. And they used to say that to themselves too. When the
Messenger of Allah (&$ came to Madeenah, Allah revealed these
words conceming them and what we used to say about them and
what they used to say about themselves:
(Say, '0' 'Ibridi I[My slaves] who have transgressed against
themselves [by committing evil deeds and sins]! Despair not of the
Mercy of Allah, verily, Allah forgives all sins. Truly, He is ORForgiving, Most Merciful. And turn in repentance and in obedience
with true Faith [Islamic Monotheism] to your Lord and submit to
Him [in Islam] before the torment comes upon you, [and] then you
will not be helped. And follow the best of that which is sent down to
you from your Lord [i.e. this Qur'an, do what it orders you to do and
keep away from what it forbids], before the torment comes on you
(Qur'an 39. 53-55)
suddenly while you perceive not!)

"When it reached me, I sat down and read it in Dhu Tuwa (one of the

Exalted, Almighty caused me to understand that it had been revealed

others said about us. I went back to my camel and sat on it, and went

'Umar in MaWrah

to join the Messenger of Allah Plessings and peace be upon him) in
~adeenah."~'
This event shows us how 'Umar drew up a plan of migration
for himself and his two companions, 'Ayyzsh ibn Abi Rabee'ah and
Hishim ibn al-'A? ibn Wg'il as-Sahmi. Each ofthe three came from a
different tribe, and the place where they had agreed to meet was far
from Makkah, outside the boundary of the Haram (sanctuary), on the
road to Madeenah. He stipulated the time and place clearly, so that if
one of them was delayed, the other two would go on and would not
wait for him, because something had prevented him from joining
them. As they expected, Hishim ibn al-'& was prevented from
joining them, and 'Umar and 'Ayykb went ahead with their
migration. The plan was a complete success, and they reached
Madeenah safe and sound.7zBut Quraysh was determined to pursue
the Muhdjireen, so they devised a well-thought-out plan which was
implemented by Abu Jabl and al-Hirith, who were half-brothers of
'Ayykh through his mother, which was what made 'Ayykh trust
them, especially since the matter had to do with his mother. Abu Jahl
made up this story because he knew of the compassion and love that
'Ayygsh felt towards his mother, which was clearly manifested when
he agreed to go back with them. This incident also shows us the sense
of danger that 'Umar (&)possessed, when his intuition told him of
the kidnap plot.73
It also demonstrates to us the high degree of brotherhood that
had been established by Islam. 'Umar was willing to sacrifice half of
his wealth for the sake of his brother's safety, because he feared that

he would be persecuted by the mushrikeen after he went back to
Makkah. But 'Ayyish was overwhelmed by his feelings for his
mother and his desire to honour her, so he decided to go back to
Makkah and honour his mother's oath, and bring the wealth that he
had left there. And his pride would not allow him to take half the
wealth of his brother 'Umar (&) when he had his own wealth sitting
untouched in Makkah. But 'Umar was more far-sighted. It is as if he
could see the misfortune that would befall 'Ayykh if he went hack to
Makkah. When he was unable to convince him, he gave him hls welltrained camel. And the betrayal of the mushrikeen which was
expected by 'Umar did indeed befall ' ~ y y i s h . " ~
The idea had become widespread among the Muslims that
Allah would not accept any good deeds from those who were put to
trial and succumbed, and remained living in the jihili society. Then
Allah (&) revealed the words: (Say, '0' 'fiidi M y slaves] who
have transgressed against themselves [by committing evil deeds and
sins]! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah...).
No sooner had these words been revealed but 'Umar hastened
to write them down and send them to his two dear brothers, 'Amish
and Hishim, so that they would try again to escape the camp of hfr.
What a sublime anitude the son of al-KhatJ2b displayed. He had tried
to persuade his brother 'Ayygsh, offering him half of his wealth to
convince him not to leave Madeenah, and he had given him his shecamel so that he might flee on her. Yet despite all that, he did not
remind him of what he had said or tell him off for going against his
opinion and rejecting his advice. On the contrruy, his feelings of love
and loyalty towards his brother came to the fore. No sooner has this
verse been revealed but he hastened to send it to his brothers in
Makkah and to all the weak and oppressed in that city, so that they

Muslims acquired their concepts fiom one source only. The
Holy Qur'an was to be the methodology and focal point on
which the Muslim individual, family and society were to be

The Qur hnic Education of 'Umar ibn al-Khaffrib

Through the Qur'an, 'Umar came to know Who is the God
Who must be worshipped. The Prophet &) instilled in his
heart the meanings of these verses, for he was keen to teach his
Companions the correct concept of their Lord and His rights
over them, knowing that this concept would generate certainty
and faith when their souls were purified and their nature
W a h ) became sound. 'Umar's view of Allah, the universe,
life, Paradise, Hell, the divine will and decree, the tme nature
of man and man's struggle with the Shaytin were all based on
the Holy Qur'an and the guidance of the Prophet @).
*:* Allah is above having any shortcomings; His are the attributes of
i n f ~ t perfection.
e
He is One, with no partner or associate, and
He has no wife or child.

+
*: He, the Exalted is the Creator, Sovereign and Controller of all
things:

(Indeed, your Lord is Allah, Who created the heavens and the
earth in Six Days, and then He rose over [Istawa] the Tlwone
[really in a manner that suits His Majesty]. He brings the night
as a cover over the day, seeking it rapidly, and [He created] the
sun, the moon, the stars subjected to His Command. Surely,
His is the creation and commandment. Blessed is Allah, the
Lord of the dlameen [mankind, jinn and all that exists]!)
(Qur'an 7: 54)

Allah is the source of every blessing in this universe, great or
small, manifest or hidden.
(And whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is
fiom Allah. Then, when harm touches you, unto Him you cty
aloud for help.)
(Qur'an 16: 53)

6 His knowledge encompasses all things, and nothing is hidden

from Him on earth or in heaven, nothing that man conceals or
displays openly.
*% Allah records man's deeds through the actions of His angels, in a

book in which nothing, great or small, is omitted, rather it is
recorded precisely. That will be shown to man at the
appropriate time:
$Not a word does he [or she] utter but there is a watcher by him
ready [to record it1.B
(Qur 'an 50: 18)

+:* Allah tests His slaves with things that go against their desires and
inclinations, in order to show people's essence, who among
them will accept the will and decree of Allah and submit to it
both outwardly and inwardly, and thus deserve the position of
vicegerency and leadership, and who among them will be
angry with His will and decree and thus not desenre anything
and will not be given any rank.
$Who has created death and life that He may test you which of
you is best in deed. And He is the All-Mighty, the ORForgiving.)

alone), which is the T a w h e e d Islamic monotheism -that is
described in the Holy ~ u r ' a n . ~
'Umar's view of the universe was based on the verses:
$Say [0' M u h d ] , 'Do you verily disbelieve m Him Who
created the earth in two Days? And yon set up rivals [in worship]
with Him? That is the Lord of the 'alameen [mankind,jinn and all
that exists]. He placed therein [i.e. the earth] firm mountains from
above it, and He blessed it, and measured therein its sustenance [for
its dwellers] m four Days equal [i.e. all these four 'days' were equal
in the length of time] for all those who ask [about its creation]. Then
He rose over [Istawa] towards the heaven when it was smoke, and
said to it and to the earth: Come both of you willingly or unwillingly.
They both said: We come willingly. Then He completed and finished
fiom their creation [as] seven heavens in two Days and He made m
each heaven its affair. And We adorned the nearest [lowest] heaven
with lamps [stars] to be an adornment as well as to guard [fiom the
devils by using them as missiles against the devils]. Such is the
Decree of Him, the All-Mighty, the Al-Knower.), (Qur'an 41. 9-12)
As for this life, no matter how long it lasts, it will inevitably
come to an end, and no matter how great its conveniences and
luxuries, they are in fact insignificant. Allah ( B )says:
$Verily, the likeness of [this] worldly life is as the water [rain] which
We send down fiom the sky; so by it arises the intermingled produce
of the earth of which men and cattle eat: until when the earth is clad in
its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have
all the powers of disposal over it, Our Command reaches it by night
or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not
flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Ayrit in detail for the
(Qur 'an 10. 24)
people who reflect.)

'Umar ibn al-Khattdb

71

'Umar's view of Paradise was derived ftom the verses which
describe it, and he became one of those of whom Allah ( B )says:
(Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope,
and they spend [in charity in Allah's Cause] out of what We have
bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of
(Qurhn 32: 16-17)
joy as a reward for what they used to do.)
His concept of Hell was derived kom the Holy Qur'an, and
this concept became a deterrent which prevented him h m going
astray kom the laws of Allah, Anyone who studies the life of 'Umar
will see how clear the idea of meeting Allah was in his mind, and
how greatly he feared the wrath and punishment of Allah. He went
out one night to check on the people of Madeenah, and he passed by
the house of a Muslim man and happened to see him standing and
praying. He paused to listen to his recitation, and the man recited:
#By the Toor mount]. And by the Book Inscribed. In parchment
unrolled. And by al-Bayt al-Ma 'moor [the house over the heavens
parallel to the Ka'bah at Makkah, continuously visited by the angels].
And by the roof raised high [i.e. the heaven]. And by the sea kept
filled [or it will be fire kindled on the Day of Resurrection]. Verily,
the Torment of your Lord will surely come to pass.) (Qurhn 52: 1-7)
He said: It is an oath and it is me, by the Lord of the Ka'bah!
He dismounted and leaned against a wall, and paused there for a
while, then he went back to his house, where he fell sick for a month.
The people came to visit him, not knowing what had made him ill.3
His concept of the Divine will and decree was derived *om the
Book of Allah and the teachings of the Messenger of Allah @J. This
concept was firmly entrenched in his heart, and he understood its
different categories as mentioned in the Book of Allah. He was
AT-Riqqah wa al-Buka: by 'Abdull2b ibn Alpnad al-Maqdisi p. 166.

72

The Qur hnic Education of 'Umar ibn al-Khaffib

certain that the kuowledge of Allah encompasses all things:
*Neither you [0' Muhammad] do any deed nor recite any portion of
the Qur'an, nor you [O' mankind] do any deed [good or evil], but We
are Witness thereof, when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden
from your Lord [so much as] the weight of an atom [or small ant] on
the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater
(@r2an 10: 61)
than that but is [written] in a Clear Record.)
And he was certain that Allah has decreed everything that is to be:

d... Allah is not such that anything in the heavens or in the earth
escapes Him. Verily, He is All-Knowing, All-Omnipotent%
(Qur'an 35: 44)

And that Allah is the Creator of all things:
(Such is Allah, your Lord! Ld Ildha illa Huwa [none has the right to
be worshipped but He], the Creator of all things. So worship Him
[Alone], and He is the Wakeel [Tmstee, Disposer of affairs or
(Qur'an 6: 102)
Guardian] over all things.%
This correct understanding and deep conviction of the reality of the
Divine will and decree bore many h i t s which were apparent in his
life, as we shall see in this book. From the Holy Qur'an he
understood the reality of his own self and of all men. He knew that
man's essence went back to two origins: his ancient origin when he
was first created from clay, when he was formed and the soul was
breathed into him, and his recent origin when he was created from a
drop of sperm.4 Allah (&) says:
(Who made everything He has created good and He began the
creation of man from clay. Then He made his offspring from semen

73

of despised water [male and female sexual discharge]. Then He
fashioned him in due proportion, and breathed into him the soul
[created by Allah for that person]; and He gave you hearing [ears],
sight [eyes] and hearts. Little is the thanks you give!.)
(Qur'an 32: 7-9)
He understood that Allah had created man with His own hand,
and honoured him with a beautifnl form and an upright posture. He
had blessed him with wisdom, logic and discernment, and subjugated
to h i all that is in the heavens and on earth. Allah favoured man
over much of His creation, and honoured hun by sending the
Messengers to him. The most wondrous manifestahon of this divine
honour towards man was that He made man qualitied to receive His
love and good pleasure, which could be attained by following the
Prophet (@) who called man to Islam so that they might live a good
life in this world and attain eternal bliss in the Hereafter. Allah says:
BWhoever works righteousness w h e t h e r male or female -while
he [or she] is a true believer [of Islamic Monotheism] verily, to him
We will give a good life [in this world with respect, contentment and
lawful provision], and We shall pay them certainly a reward in
proportion to the best of what they used to do [i.e. Paradise in the
(Qur hn 16. 97)
Hereafter].)
'Umar understood the true nature of the struggle between man
and the Shaytcin. He knew that this enemy comes to man from before
and behind, kom his right and from his left and whispers to him,
tempting him to commit sin, and stimng up his desires. He used to
seek the help of Allah against his enemy Iblees and he prevailed over
him throughout his life, as we shall see as we study his biography.
He learned from the story of Adam with the Shay@iz, as
mentioned in the Qur'an, that Adam was the original man, and that
the essence of Islam is absolute obedience to Allah, and that man is

74

The Qur bnic Education of 'Umar ibn al-Khaffrib

vulnerable to falling into sin. From the story of Adam's sin he learned
the necessity of putting one's trust in Allah, the importance of
repentance and praying for forgiveness in the life of the believer, the
necessity of keeping away from envy and arrogance, and the
importance of speaking in the best manner to one's companions,
because Allah (%) says:
(And say to My slaves [i.e. the true believers of Islamic Monotheism]
that they should [only] say those words that are the best. [Because]
Shayccin [Satan] verily, sows a state of conflict and disagreements
among them. Surely, Shuytcin [Satan] is to man a plain enemy.)
(Qur 'an 17: 53)
He followed the path of the Messenger of AUah &) in the
way in which he purified his Companions' hearts and souls by means
of all kinds of acts of worship, and training them to follow the
guidelines for manners and attitude that were laid out in the Qur'an.
Allah blessed 'Umar ibn al-Khan2b (&) with Islam which
offered hi a sound and pure belief. This replaced his former beliefs
and put an end to them. Thus the pillars of idolatry collapsed: there
was no drawing close to idols, no daughters of Allah, no kinship
between the jinn and Allah, no soothsayers to direct the course of
society and lead it into confusion and superstition, and no oblivion
after death.' All these notions were dispelled and replaced with belief
in Allah alone, cleansed of any ideas of shirk, sons of Allah,
soothsaying or oblivion after death. They were replaced with belief in
a Hereafter in which man will 6nally be confronted with his deeds
and will be rewarded or punished accordingly. The nonsensicaljihili
belief in a life with no resurrection and no questioning before the
Judge was replaced with belief in the Last Day and responsibility for

one's deeds. 'Umar was fully absorbed into this religion, and Allah
and His Messenger became more beloved to him than anything or
anyone else. He worshipped AUah alone with full sincerity, as if he
could see ~ i mFrom
. ~ the Qur'an, 'Umar began to leam everything
from laws to etiquette, history to wisdom. He persisted at a steady
pace, with the help of Allah, living with the Qur'an which influenced
his mind, heart, soul and spirit and had an impact on his behaviour.
The reason for that - after the help of Allah -was his leaming at
the hands of the Messenger of Allah @,).7

with the Holy w a n
'Umar (&) was one of the bravest and most courageous of the
Sahibah. He would often ask the Messenger of Allah &)about his
decisions if he did not understand them, and he would offer his
opinion and ijtihad with all honesty and clarity. Because of his deep
understanding of the aims of the Qur'an, verses of Qur'an were
revealed wlnch coincided with his opinion in some instances. 'Umar
said: "My opmion coincided with that of Allah or of my Lord in three matters. I said, KO' Messenger of All& why don't you take

Believers to observe hqib?' and Allah revealed the verse of hijib.
And I heard that the Prophet &)had rebuked some of his wives, so I
went to them and said, 'Either you stop, or Allah will give His
Messenger (wives) who are better than you.' I went to one of his
wives and she said, '0' 'Umar, don't you think that the Messenger of
Allah (g)
is able to exhort his wives? Why are you speaking to
them?' hen Allah revealed the words:
$It may be if he divorced you [all] that his Lord will give him instead
of you, wives better than you - Muslims [who submit to Allah],
believers, obedient [to Allah], turning to Allah in repentance,
worshipping Allah sincerely, given to fasting or emigrants [for
Allah's sake], previously married and virgins.)
(Qur'an 66: 5)))

1.2.2. Not offering the funeral prayer

for the hypocrites
'Umar said: ((When 'Abdull& ibn Ubayy died, the Messenger
of Allah (g)
was called to offer the funeral prayer for him. He went
there and when he stood to offer the prayer for him, I went and stood
in kont of him and said: "0' Messenger of Allah, are you going to
offer the funeral prayer for the enemy of Allah 'Abdull& ibn Ubayy,
who said such and such on such and such a day?" and I listed his evil
deeds, whilst the Messenger of Allah &) smiled, until I had said too
much. Then be said, "Get away from me, 0' 'Umar, for I have been
given the choice and I have made my choice. It was said to me,
(Whether you [O' Muhammad] ask forgiveness for them
mypocrites] or ask not forgiveness for them - [and even] if
you ask seventy times for their forgiveness -Allah will not forgive
them because they have disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger

Nuhammad]. And Allah guides not those people who are Fisiqoon
[rebellious, disobedient to Allah1.b
(Qur 'an 9. 80)
If 1knew that by asking more than seventy times for his forgiveness
he would be forgiven, I would ask more than seventy times." Then
he offered the fuoeral prayer for him and accompanied him to his
grave, until the burial was finished. I started to wonder at my own
audacity in speaking to the Messenger of Allah (g)
in this manner,
but Allah and His Messenger knew best. It was not long before this
verse was revealed:

#And never [0' Muhammad] pray [funeral prayer] for any of them
(Qur'an 9: 84)
[hypocrites] who dies, nor stand at his grave...)
After that the Messenger of Allah (&) did not offer the funeral
prayer for any hypocrite, nor did he stand at his grave, until Allah
took his soul.))9

1.2.3. The prisoners of Badr
'Umar said: ((On the day of Badr, when Allah defeated the

you should let 'Ali deal with eel" and stxike his neck; and you

Allah @) did not like what I said, and he accepted the ransom from
them. The next day I went to the Messenger of Allah &) and he and
Abu Bakr were sitting there, weeping. I said, "0' Messenger of
Allah, what has made you and your Companion weep? If I can, I will
weep with you, and if I cannot then I will pretend to weep." The
Messenger of Allah &) said, "Because of what your companions
suggested of accepting the ransom, your punishment was shown to
me closer than this tree." Then Allah revealed the words:
(It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war [and free
them with ransom] until he had made a great slaughter [among his
enemies] in the land. You desire the good of this world [i.e. the
money of ransom for freeing the captives], but Allah desires [for you]
the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. Were it not a
previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have
touched you for what you took.)
(Qur'an 8: 67-68)
The following year, seventy of them were killed, and the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah
fled; his tooth was
broken and his helmet smashed, and bloodflowed down his face.
Then Allah revealed the words:

a)

([What is the matter with you?] When a single disaster smites you,
although you smote [your enemies] with one twice as great, you say:
'From where does this come to us?' Say [to them], 'It is from
yourselves wecause of your evil deeds]' - because of your
accepting the ransom. And Allah has power over all things.)

1.2.4. Seeking permission to enter

a)

The Prophet
sent a slave from among the An& to 'Umar
ibn al-Kha@b at noon time to call him. He entered his house when he
was sleeping and part of his body had become uncovered. He said:
"0' Allah, forbid people to enter our houses at the time when we are
sleeping." According to another report he said: "0' Messenger of
Allah, I wish that Allah would give us some commands and
prohibitions with regard to asking permission to enter.,"' Then the
words were revealed:
$0' you who believe! Let your slaves and slave-girls, and those
among you who have not come to the age of puberty ask your
permission [before they come to your presence] on three occasions:
before Fajr [morning] Salih [prayer], and while you put off your
clothes for the noonday [rest], and after the 'Ish6' [night] Salih

and for all." Then the verse in Soorah an-Nisi' was revealed:

caller of the Messenger of Allah
would c ~ out
y that no drunken
person should approach the prayer. 'Umar was called and this verse
was recited to him, and he said: "0 Allah, clarify the issue of alcohol
for us once and for all." Then the verse in Soorah al-Mi'idah was
revealed, and 'Umar was called and it was recited to him. When he
reached the words, (So, will yon not then abstain?), (Qurhn 5: 91).
'Umar said, "We have abstained, we have abstained.")>13
So the prohibition of alcohol was approached in a gradual
manner, and from the words (So, will you not then abstain?), (Qur 'an
5: 91). 'Umar understood that this rhetorical question was in fact a
prohibition, because this question was more p o w e f i and more
definitive than a prohibition expressed in the usual style. From the
wording and context of the verse it is as clear as day that this is a
prohibition.14

1.2.6. His knowledge of the reasons for revelation
'Umar memorized the entire Qur'an during a period that began
with his conversion and ended with the death of the Messenger
He memorized it along with the reasons for revelation, except for
those verses that had been revealed before he became Muslim, which
he learned in general terms.

a).

We would not be exaggerating if we said that 'Umar knew
many of the reasons for revelation, especially during the part of his
life when he was Muslim. Because he was so close to the Messenger
of Allah @), learning directly from him, and because he learned
from him what he had missed of the Qur'an, he acquired deep
knowledge of the reasons for revelation when the Qur'an was still

fresh and events were still unfolding in front of him. Thus the matter
was something easy for him.I5
'Umar himself was the reason for the revelation of more than
one verse, some of which are known by scholarly consensus to have
been revealed in Makkah and others which are similarly known to
have been revealed in Madeenah. In the case of some verses, 'Umar
h e w precisely where and when they were revealed. He said
concerning the verse:

Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.)

was the direct reason
for the revelation of several verses, including the passage in which
Allah (&) says:

the maintenance of al-Masjid al-Harim [at Makkah] as equal to the
worth of those who believe in AUah and the Last Day, and strive hard
and fight in the Cause of Allah? They are not equal before Allah. And
AUah guides not those people who are the @ilimoon [polytheists
and wrongdoers]. Those who believed [m the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism] and emigrated and strove hard and fought in
Allah's Cause with their wealth and their lives, are far higher in

1.2.7. 'Umar's asking the Messenger
of Allah (g)
about some verses
'Umar (&) used to ask the Messenger of Allah &) about
some verses, and sometimes he would hear another Sahribi asking the
about some verses, and he would memorize
Messenger of Allah
the answers and teach them to whomever he wanted of those who
sought knowledge.

It was narrated that Ya'la ibn Umayyah said: ((1asked 'Umar
ibn d-Khagb: d... there is no sin on you if you shorten as-Saldh [the
prayer] if you fear that the disbelievers may put you in trial [attack
you]...) (Qur'an 4: 101) But the people are safe now." 'Umar said to

And 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb (&) was asked about this verse:

Then I understood the meaning of this verse."20

1.2.8. 'Umar's commentary on some verses
'Umar would try to avoid commenting on Qur'an on the basis
of his own opinion. Hence when he was asked about the verse, $By
[the winds] that scatter dust) (Qur'an 51: I), he said: "It means the
wind, and were it not that I heard the Messenger of Allah (g)
say
that, I would not have said it." He was asked about the verse: $And
[the clouds] that bear heavy weight of water) (Qur'an 51: 2), and he
said: "It means the clouds, and were it not that I heard the Messenger
of Allah &) say that, I would not have said it." He was asked about
the verse,-$And [the ships] that float with ease and gentleness)
(Qur'an 51: 3). He said: "It means ships, and were it not that I heard
the Messenger of Allah
say that, I would not have said it." He
was asked about the verse, {And those [angels] who distribute
[provisions, rain, and other blessings] by [Allah's] Command)
(Qur'an 51: 4). He said: "It means the angels, and were it not that I
heard the Messenger of Allah @g say that, I would not have said

a)

it."21

'Umar had a particular methodology in commenting on verses
of Qur'an. If he knew that the Messenger of Allah &) had
commented on a verse, he would follow his commentary, which is the
best way. We have seen an example of this above. If he did not know

of any comment by the Messenger of Allah @J, he would check
with the knowledgeable people among the ~ a h i b a h ,such as Ibn
'Abbk, Ubayy ibn Ka'b, 'Abdullih ibn Mas'ood, Mu'idh and others
(may Allah be pleased with them all). The following is an example of
that.
One day 'Umar said to the Companions of the Prophet
crconceming what do you think this verse was revealed:

a):

(Would any of you wish to have a garden with date palms and vines,
with rivers flowing underneath, and all kinds of h i t s for him therein,
while he is stricken with old age, and his children are weak [not able
to look after themselves], then it is struck with a fiery whirlwind, so
that it is burnt? Thus does Allah make clear His ayit [proofs,
evidences, verses] to you that you may give thought.)
(Qur'an 2: 266)?

They said: "Allah h o w s best." 'Umar became angry and said, "Say
we know or we do not know." Ibn 'Abbk said, "I think I have an
idea about it, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen." 'Umar said, "0' son of my
brother, speak and do not belittle yourself."bn 'Abbis said, "It is the
similitude of some deed." 'Umar said, "Which deed?" Ibn 'Abbk
said, "Some deed." 'Umar said, "(It is a similitude of) a rich man
who strives to obey Allah, then Allah sends the Shaytin to him and
he starts to commit sin until his good deeds are destroyed.">>22
According to another report, Ibn 'Abbk said, "This is referring to
deeds, for the son of Adam is most in need of his garden when he has
grown old and has numerous dependents, and the son of Adam is
most in need of his good deeds on the day when he is resurrected."
'Umar said, "You have spoken correctly, 0' son of my hr~ther."'~

'Umar also commented on some other verses, such as the passage:
(Who, when afflicted with calamity, say, 'Truly, to Allah we belong
and truly, to H i we shall return.' They are those on whom are the
Salawcit [i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven] kom their Lord,
and [they are those who] receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the
guided ones.),
(Qur 'an 2: 156-157)

'Umar said: "What a good reward and what a good bonus."24 What
he meant by reward was blessings and mercy, and what he meant by
bonus was right guidance.25
He heard someone reciting the verse, $0' man! What has made
you careless about your Lord, the Most Generous?) (Qur 'an 82: 6)
and said: "This means ignorance."26
He explained the verse, (And when the souls are joined with
their bodies [the good with the good and the bad with the bad])
(Qurhn 81: 7), by saying: "Evildoers with evildoers and righteous
with righteous."27
He explained the verse, (Turn to Allah with sincere
repentance) (Qurhn 66: 8), by saying: "(This means) repenting and
not going back to sin, that is the complete repentance that is
required."28
One day he passed by the cell of a monk and called him,
saying, "0' monk!" The monk looked out and 'Umar began to look
at him and weep. It was said to him "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, why
are you weeping for him?" He said: "I remembered the words of

2. His Keeping Company with the
Messenger of Allah (s)
'Umar was one of the Makkans who could read and write in an
illiterate society, which is indicative of his keenness to acquire
knowledge from an early age. He strove to become one of the few,
those who became literate and educated themselves, thus occupying
a prominent posihon at the time of the Prophethood due to a
combination of qualities including the ability to read and write,
which was something that meant a great deal at that time.

'Umar received his early education, and learned how to read
and write, at the hands of Harb ibn Umayyah, the father of Abu
~ u f i ~ i i nThis
. ~ ' distinction qualified him to acquire the education and
knowledge that was available at that time. However we are certain
that the strongest factor that influenced 'Umar's personality, honed
his talents, sparked his potential and purified his soul was his keeping
and studying at his hands.

he became Muslim, and he stayed close to him in Madeenah too.
'Umar lived in al-'Awili, which was originally on the outskirts of
Madeenah
although now it has become part of it, and now abuts
the Prophet's Mosque, following the expansion of the Mosque. In
this place he organized himself and was keen to study all aspects of
knowledge at the hands of the Teacher and Guide of Mankind, whom
Allah had taught and taught well. He did not miss any knowledge of
Qur'an, any hadith, command, event or exhortation. 'Umar said: "I
had a neighbour from among the Ansir, fiom Banu Umayyah ibn
Zayd, who lived in al-'Awgli in Madeenah. He and I would take it in
turns to go down to the Messenger of Allah &). He would go down
one day and I would go down the next. When I went down I would
bring him the day's news of Revelation and other matters, and when
he went down he would do like~ise."~'
-

This reports points to the abundant wellspring from which
'Umar derived his knowledge and education. It was the Book of
Allah which was being revealed to the Messenger of Allah (s)in
stages, accord'mg to events. The Messenger of Allah
would
recite it to his Companions, who learned its meanings and understood
it in detall, and were greatly influenced by its principles. It had a deep
impact on their hearts, minds and souls. 'Umar was one of those who
were influenced by the Qur'anic method of education. Everyone who
studies the history of 'Umar should pause and ponder this pure,
divine wellspring which nourished them talents and brought their
genius to the fore, and caused people's knowledge to grow. What we
are speaking of here is the Holy Qur'an.

a)

From the time he became Muslim, 'Umar was keen to
memorize Qur'an and to understand it and ponder its meanings. He
remained close to the Messenger, leaming what was revealed to him,

until he had memorized all the verses and Soorahs ofthe Qur'an. The
Prophet &) taught him one recitation ofthe Qur'an and he was keen
to adhere to the recitation that the Messenger of Allah &) had taught
him.33 On occasion, 'Umar had the honour of being the fust one to
hear some verses as soon as they had been revealed. He was also very
keen to study and review what he had memorized.34 'Umar was
trained accordmg to the Qur'anic method and the one who taught him

the Prophet &), coming forth kom darkness into light, acquiring
faith and shunning kuf.He was able to bear hardships for the sake of
his new religion and its pure beliefs. The personality of the
Messenger of Allah &) was the main attraction to Islam, for he
possessed the ability
attract and influence others. Allah has
prepared him and moulded him and made him the most perfect
human being in the history of the world. Greatness is always loved
and admired by people; admirers gather around it and remain
attached to it, because of that love and admiration. But in the case of
added to that greatness was the fact that
the Messenger of Allah
he was the Messenger of Allah, the one who received revelation &om
Allah and conveyed it to mankind. This added a further dimension to
the impact on the believer's feelings towards him. He was not loved
only for himself as great men are loved, but also for that divine
connection. For when a believer was in the presence of the
Messenger of Allah &), he was also in the presence of Divine
revelation. So the Messenger of AUah @$, was both a great human
being and a great Messenger; these two qualities ultimately
combined and became one, with no distinction between them. Thus

The @r hnic Education of 'Umar ibn a l - K h a g b

the believer's love for the Messenger of Allah @) was love for the
Messenger as a hwnan being and for the human being as a
Messenger. Love for Allah was connected to love for His Messenger,
and the two joined together in the believer's heart, becoming the
focal point of all his emotions and the basis for his behaviour and
anitudes.
This love that motivated the first generation of the Sahriboh is
the focus and starting point of Islamic education.35 Through the
blessing of keeping company with the Messenger of Allah I&) and
learning at his hands, the Sahibah attained a high level of faith.
Sayyid Qutb says concerning this purification and education:
"It was indeed a purification. That is what the Messenger of Allah
&
fJ did with them to purify their hearts and their emotions, their
deeds and behaviour, their marital and social lives. It was a
purification that lifted their sods &om belief in shirk to belief in
T d e e d , from false notions to tsue belief, from nonsensical myths to
clear certainty. It raised them from the filth of immorality to the purity
of faith, h m the filth of riba (usury) and harcim earnings to the
purity of halil income. It was a complete purification of the
individual and the society, of their hearts and deeds, a purification
which raised man and all his concepts of life, himself and his origins
to the realm of light where he is connected with his Lord and the
(angels) on high."36

a)

'Umar studied at the hands of the Messenger of Allah
and
learned from him the Qur'an and Sunnah, the rules of recitation
(tiliwah) and how souls are purified. Allah (&) says:

His Prophet. The means to achieve that are: immersing oneself in
study of Arabic language and literature, and being acquainted with all
its literary styles, as well as acquiring all the knowledge and
experience that will enable one to understand it. Such was mar.^^

There was a deep love between the Messenger of Allah
and 'Umar, and love is an important factor in creating a suitable
atmosphere between teacher and student that will produce the best

results. 'Umar loved the Messenger of Allah
prepared to sacrifice himself for him. It is narrated in the hadith that
the Messenger of Allah (&J said: (('Wo one of you truly believes

people."41 'Umar said to him, "By Allah, 0' Messenger of Allah,
you are more beloved to me than everyone except myself." He said,

The Qur'anic Education of 'Urnar ibn al-Khanrib

Kha@b killed his maternal uncle al-'A~ibn ~ i s h h ~ not
' , caring at
all about any ties of kinship with him in comparison to the ties of
faith. Indeed he used to boast about that, as a means of aflirming this
principle. Atter the battle ended, he suggested killing the rnushrik
prisoners of war. This event offers great lessons which I have
discussed in my book on the Prophet's biography which is entitled
as-Seerah an-Nabawiyah Xrad Waqi'i' wa Tahleel Ahadith.
When al-'Abbk, the paternal uncle of the Prophet @), was
taken captive, 'Umar was keen for him to be guided to Islam, and he
said to him: "0 'Abbis, become Muslim, for by Allah, if yon become
Muslim that will be dearer to me than if al-Kha@b were to become
Muslim. That is only because I saw that the Messenger of AUah &)
wishes that you would become ~ n s l ~ m . " ~ '
Also among the prisoners was Suhayl ibn 'Amr, the
-,
spokesman of Quraysh. 'Umar said to the Messenger of Allah @):
(<'O' Messenger of Allah, let me knock out the kont teeth of Suhayl
ibn 'Amr so that his tongue will protmde and he will never stand and
deliver speeches against you in any place." The Messenger of Allah
said: "I will not mutilate him lest Allah mutilate me even though
I am a Prophet. Perhaps there will come a time when he will stand
and speak in such a way that you will not be able to criticize him.")>"
And this is in fact what happened after the Messenger of Allah &)
passed away. A number of the people of Makkah thought of
apostatizing ftom Islam, and the governor of M W , 'At2b ibn
Usayd, was a h i d of them and hid himself. Suhayl ibn 'Amr stood up
and praised and glorified Allah, then he mentioned the death of the
Prophet (B)and said: "That only makes Islam stronger, for whoever

'Umar ibn al-Khaftdb

causes trouble, we will strike his neck (kill him)." So the people gave
up that idea.s3
'Umar narrated a hadith which he heard kom the Messenger of
Allah @,), when he addressed the mushrikeen of Makkah who had
been killed at Badr. It was narrated that Anas said: <(''We were with
'Umar between Maldcah and Madeenah, watching for the new moon.
I had good eyesight, and I saw it and said to 'Umar, 'Don't you see
it?' He said, 'I will see it when I am lying in my bed.' Then he started
telling us about the people of Badr. He said, 'The Messenger of Allah
@J started to show us where they (the mushrikeen) would fall the
i where So and so will fall tomorrow if
following day, saying, 'This B
Allah wills, this is where So and so will fall tomorrow, if Allah wills.'
And they fell in those places. I said, 'By the One Who sent you with
the truth, they fell in those places.' They fell there, then he ordered
that they be thrown into a dry well. Then he went towards them and
said, '0' So and so, 0'So and so, have you found what your Lord
promised you to be true? For I have found what my Lord promised
me to be h e . ' 'Umar said, '0' Messenger of Allah, are you speaking

after the battle of

Badr, 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b was among a group of Muslims who
were t a l h g about the day of Badr and remembering how Allah had

Messenger of Allah @) said: "Allah has honoured us with a greeting
that is better than your greeting, 0' 'Umayr; (it is) salim, the greeting
of the people of ~aradise."~'He asked: "Why have you come, 0'
'Umayr?" He said: "I have come because of that prisoner whom you
are holding; keat him well." He asked: "What is this sword around
your neck?" He answered: "What useless swords they are! Did they
help us in any way?" He (the Prophet) asked: "Tell me the tmth, why
have you come?" He answered: "I only came because of that
(prisoner)." He said: "No, rather you sat down with Safwin ibn
Umayyah in al-Hijr, and you spoke about the people in the well at
Badr, then yon said, 'Were it not that I have debts and dependents, I
would go out and kill Muhammad.'So Safwin ibn Umayyah took
responsibility for your debts and dependents, on condition that you
kill me for him. But Allah is protecting me from you." 'Umayr said:
"I bear witness that you are the Messenger of AUah, for, 0'

in which no one else was present except Safwh and myself. By

From this story we can see the sense of security that was a
distinguishing characteristic of 'Umar (&). He noticed the arrival of
'Umayr ibn Wahb and alerted others, and declared that he was a devil
who had only come for an evil purpose. His history was known to
'Umar, for he had persecutedthe Muslims in Makkah, and he was the
one who had incited (the mushrikeen) to fight the Muslims at Badr
and had gathered information about their numbers. Hence 'Urnar

The fact that Abu Sufiyk asked about the Messenger of Allah

concerned about these three more than any others, because they knew
that they were the leaders of Islam, by whose efforts Islam had
become established; they were the pillars of its state and system. The

mushrikeen thought that if they died, Islam would not survive. The

silence in response to Abu Sufiyb's initial questions was aimed at
belittling him, but when he began to express joy and arrogance, they
told him what was really the case and responded to him with
courage.61
Dnring the battle of Banu al-Musplaq, 'Umar played a
distinguished role. We will let an eyewitness tell us what he saw.
Jibir ibn 'Abdullib al-Ansiri said: "We were on a campaign and a
man from among the Muhijireen kicked a man from among the
An@. The Ansiri said: "Help me, 0' Ansir!" and the Muhijir said,
"Help me, 0' Muhijireen!" (seeking their support in a fight). The
Messenger of Allah (&J heard that and said: "Stop it, for it (i.e.,
tribalism) is no good." 'Abdullib ibn Ubayy heard about that and
said: "Have they gone so far? When we go back to Madeenah, the
more honourable (meaning himself) will expel therefrom the meaner
[meaning the Messenger of Allah &)I." 'Umar heard that and went
to the Prophet @) and said: "0' Messenger of Allah, let me sbike
the neck of this hypocrite!" The Prophet @) said: "Leave him alone.
Let it not be said that Muhammad is k i h g his ~ o m ~ a n i o n s . " ~ ~
According to another report, 'Umar ibn al-Khagb said: "Tell
'Abbid ibn Bishr to kill him ('Abdull21 ibn Ubayy)." The
Messenger of Allah @) said to him: "What do you think, 0' 'Umar,
if the people start saying that Muhammad is killing his Companions?
No. rather tell the people that it is time to move on." That was at a
time when the Messenger of AUah &) would not ordinarily have
moved on, but the people moved on.63 From the attitude and
instructions of the Prophet (@), 'Umar understood that it was the
matter of pros and cons. This is clear from the words of the Prophet

a huge difference between the people speaking about the love that the

his Companions. No doubt if that had happened, there would have
been attempts on the part of the enemy to infiltrate the Muslims in
Madeenah, as they would not be despairing of ever achieving
anything in the face of such love and devotion.66

During the battle of al-Khandaq, Jibir narrated that 'Umar ibn
al-Khaeh came on the day of al-Khandaq after the sun had set, and
he started to curse the Ruff& of Quraysh and said: "0' Messenger of
AUah, I could hardly pray until the sun had almost set." The Prophet
said: "I too have not prayed, by Allah." So we went down into

towards them. But I will tell you of a man who is more able to do that
than me: 'Uthmh ibn 'Affan." So the Messenger of Allah @) called
'Uthmiin ibn ' A E n and sent him to Abu Sufiyh and the leaders of
Quraysh, to tell them that he had not come to wage war, rather he had
come to visit this House (the Ka'bah) and venerate its ~anctity.~'
After an agreement had been reached, but before the treaty
documents were signed, there was strong opposition among the
Muslims to this agreement, especially with regard to the two
conditions to which the Prophet @) had committed, namely the
condition which obliged him to send back any Muslim who came to
join the Muslims in Madeenah, whereas Quraysh were not obliged to
send back any Muslims who apostatized and came to join them, and
the condition which obliged the Muslims to go back kom alHudaybiyah to Madeenah without entering Makkah that year. Those
who objected most strongly to this agreement were 'Umar ibn alKhaMb, Usayd ibn Hu@yr, the chief of al-Aws, and Said ibn
'Ubzdah, the chief of al-Khazraj. Historians state that 'Umar ibn alKhaGib came. to the Messenger of Allah
to voice his objection to
this agreement and said to the Messenger of Allah @): (("Are you
not the Messenger of Allah?" He said, "Yes." He asked: "Are we not

they not mushrikeen?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Then why should we

stop argumg and objecting, 'Listen to him, for I bear witness that he
is the Messenger of Allah, and that the truth is what he enjoins. He
will never go against the command of Allah and Allah will never
forsake him.' "71
M e r the sad incident of Abu Jandal, the Sahribah renewed
their objections to the treaty, and a group of them, including 'Umar
ibn al-KhaMb, went to the Messenger of Allah @J to discuss it with
him and voice their objections anew. But by means of the patience,
wisdom, forbearance and persuasiveness that Allah had given him,
the Prophet (g)
was able to convince them of the soundness of the
treaty, that it was in the interests of the Muslims and was a victory for
them72,and that Allah would grant the weak and oppressed such as
Abu Jandal a way out. What the Prophet
spoke of came to pass.
' U r n learned from the Messenger of i l a h &) how to respect
honest opposition; hence we see that dunhg his caliphate he
encouraged the Sahribah to voice sound opinions that served the
public interest.73 Freedom of opinion is guaranteed in the Islamic
society, and the individual in a Muslim society has the right to
express his opinion freely, even if this opinion differs from that of
some ruler or caliph. One of the rights of the Muslim individual is to
express his point of view in an atmosphere of safety and security,

person deserves to disappear into the prison system?4
This attitude of 'Umar's was not based on any kind of doubt or

land?" 'Umar said: "The Messenger of Allah &) did not give me
any instructions concerning them, rather he told me to go and fight
Hawkin in ~urbah."'~ This campaign teaches three things
concerning military matters:
1. That 'Umar had become qualified to command troops. If that were
not the case, the Prophet @) would not have appointed him to lead
one of the Muslim campaigns that went into an extremely dangerous
area, against one of the strongest and most powerful of the Arab
tribes.
2. That 'Umar, who travelled by night and hid by day, was following
the principle of catching the enemy unawares, which is one of the
most important principles of war. This enabled him to catch the
enemy off guard and cause them to flee, and in this manner his small
troop was able to achieve victory over the more numerous forces of
the mushrikeen.
3. 'Umar implemented both the letter and the spirit of the commands
of his superior, never deviating from them. This is the essence of
military discipline in all eras and all places.81

During the battle of Khaybar, when the Messenger of Allah
@) drew lose to Khaybar, he gave the flag to 'Umar ibn al-KhatJib.

of Khaybar, among whom was Marhab who was reciting lines of
inflammatoryverse. He and 'Ali engaged in solitary combat, and 'All
struck him such a blow on the head that his sword broke on his
helmet and the people in the camp heard that blow. Soon the rest of
the people joined 'Ali and fought until Allah granted them victory.
When they came back kom Khaybar, some of the Companions
ofthe Prophet @) said, cc"So and so is a martyr.'But the Messenger
of Allah @) said, 'Wo he is not. I saw him in Hell wearing a cloak
that he stole from the war booty." Then the Messenger of Allah &)
said, "0' son of al-Khagb, go and announce to the people that no

announced that no one would enter Paradise except the believers.))82

The Qur hnic Education of 'Umar ibn al-Khaggdb

a)

When the Messenger of Allah
had completed his
b Abi Balta'ah
preparations for the march on Makkah, c ~ ~ 2 t ibn
wrote a letter to the people of Makkah, telling them that the Prophet
(@), was moving in their direction, but Allah caused His Prophet to
know of that letter by means of the Revelation, so he was able to nip
sent 'Ah and al-MiqW
this problem in the bud. The Prophet (g)
who caught the woman who was carrying the letter in Rawdat KhW,
twelve miles from Madeenah. They threatened to examine her if she
did not give them the letter, so she handed it over. Then the Prophet
(g)summoned Hgcib to investigate the matter. He said: "0'
Messenger of Allah, do not be hasty with me. I was a man who was
an ally of Quraysh, but I was not one of them. The Muhi~ireenwho
are with you have relatives who will protect their families and wealth,
but I do not have such blood ties, so I wanted to do them a favour so
that they would protect my relatives there. I did not do it because I
wanted to apostatize from my religion or because I approved of kufi
after having become Muslim." The Messenger of Allah @) said,
"He had told you the truth." 'Umar said, "0' Messenger of h a h , let
said, "He was
me strike the neck ofthis hypocrite!" The Prophet
present at Badr, and you do not know, perhaps AUah looked upon
those who were present at Badr and said, 'Do what you wish, for I
~ ~ the discussion that took place between
have forgiven you.' " D From
the Messenger @) and 'Umar ibn al-Khag2b about the case of H2tib
we may learn several lessons, including the following:

a)

+$ That the punishment for spying is execution. 'Umar mentioned

that and the Messenger 0 did not deny it, but he did not
allow him to carry out the punishment because he mitib) had
been present at Badr.
Q That 'Umar took the matter of religion very seriously, as was

" Bukhai, al-Maghizi, hadith no. 4274.

'Umar ibn al-Khagib

107

demonstrated when he asked permission to strike the neck of
Hitib (i.e., execute him).
+:* That a major sin does not nullify faith. What Hitib did was a major
sin, namely spying, but nevertheless he was still a believer.
0:.

'Umar described Hitib as a hypocrite in the linguistic sense of the
word, not in the technical shar'i sense of one who inwardly
conceals kufr whilst making an outward display of being
Muslim. What 'Umar meant was that Hitib felt one thing
inwardly and did something else outwardly, when he sent his
letter that conflicted with the faith for which he was going out
to fight and shed his blood.85

4 'Umar calmed down after he heard what the Messenger of Allah

@gJ said. Within seconds, he turned kom an angry man who
was calling for Hitib to be punished for this major sin, to a
man who wept with fear (of Allah) and said: "Allah and His
Messenger know best." That is because his anger was for the
sake of Allah and His Messenger, so when he understood that
what was pleasing to Allah and His Messenger @) was
something other than what he thought, he overlooked Hatib's
mistake and treated him with kindness, out of respect for his
record of jihada6
When the Messenger of Allah &) stopped in Marr a&Dhahriln
and Abu Sufiyh feared for his life, al-'Abbis, the paternal
uncle of the Messenger of Allah WJ, asked the Messenger of Allah
@) to give him protection and he agreed. Al-'AbbG ibn 'AbdulMumlib said that he said: "Woe to you, 0' Abu Sufiyiln! Here is the
Messenger of Allah &) among the people, what a terrible day for
Quraysh!" He said, "What can I do, may my father and mother be

sacrificed for you?" I said: "If he catches you he will strike your
neck; ride behiid me on this mule until I bring you to the Messenger
of Allah
and ask him to guarantee your safety." So he rode
behind me and his two companions went back. I brought him, and
every time we passed a fire of the Muslims, they said, "Who is this?"
and when they saw the mule of the Messenger of Allah @J and me
riding it, they said, "It is the paternal uncle of the Messenger of Allah
&) on his mule." Then when I passed the fire of 'Umar ibn alKhaeb he said, "Who is this?" and got up to meet me. When he saw
Abu Sufiyin on the back of the animal he said, "Abu Sufiyin, the
enemy of Allah! Praise be to Allah who has enabled us to catch you
without any deal or treaty." Then he went out, hurrying towards the
'Umar met him and said: "0' Messenger of
Messenger of Allah (s).
Allah, here is Abu sufiyiu! Allah has enabled us to catch him
without any deal or treaty. Let me strike his neck!" I said: "0
Messenger of Allah, I have offered him my protection." When 'Umar
persisted I said, "Wait a minute, 0' 'Umar! By Allah, if he was of
Banu 'Adiyy you would not say that, but you know that he is a man
of Banu 'Abd Manif." 'Umar said, "Wait a minute, 0' 'Abbk! By
Allah when you became Muslim that was dearer to me than if alKhagib had become Muslim, and the only reason for that was that I
knew that if you became Muslim, that would be dearer to the
Messenger of Allah &)
- than if al-Khatjib were to become Muslim."
The Prophet
said: (("0''Abbk, take him to your camp, and in
the morning bring him to me."nS7

(4)

Such was the attitude of 'Umar
when he saw the enemy
of Allah passing through the Muslim ranks, protected by alL'Abbk,
the paternal uncle of the Prophet (g),
appearing humiliated and
scared. 'Umar wanted to execute the enemy of AUah as an act that

would bring him closer to Allah and an act ofjihad for His sake, but
Allah had decreed good for Abu Sufiyin and opened his h e m to
Islam, so his blood and his life were spared.88
During the battle of Hunayn, the mushrikoon caught the
Muslim army unawares and the people fled, no one caring about
anyone else. The Messenger of Allah (g)
shifted his position
towards the right, then he said: (<''Where are you going, 0' people?
Come to me! I am the Messenger of Allah
I am Muhammad ibn
'Abdullih!" But no one listened to him. The camels were bumping
into one another and the people left, except for a few of the
Muhijiroon and Ansir and his family members, who stayed with
him. Among those of the Muhrijiroon who stood firm with him were
Abu Bakr and 'Umar, and among his family members were 'Ali ibn
Abi Glib, al-'Abbb ibn 'Abdul-Mumlib and his son al-Fa(l1, Abu
Sufiyk ibn al-Hkith and his son, Rabee'ah ibn al-Hkith, and
others.89 Abu Qa6dah spoke of the stance of 'Umar during this
campaign and said: "We went out with the Messenger of Allah @)to
Hunayn, and when we met the enemy, the Muslims had the upper
hand at first. I saw a man of the mushrikeen on top of a Muslim man,
so I struck him &om behind on his shoulder with a sword and cut his
chain mail (and cut off his arm). He turned around and squeezed me
until I nearly died, then he let me go. I caught up with 'Umar ibn alKha@b and said, 'What is the matter with the people?' He said, 'It is
the will of Allah.' Then they turned back."))90

When Allah accepted the repentance of the believers, after
they had almost been defeated, Allah granted victory to His close
fiends, after they came back to their Prophet and gathered around
him. Then Allah sent down His reassurance and support to His
troops. Allah (&) says, telling us of that:
(Then Allah did send down His Sakeenah [calmness, tranquillity and
reassurance] on the Messenger pvIuhammad], and on the believers,
and sent down forces [angels] which you saw not, and punished the
disbelievers. Such is the recompense of dishelievers.8 (Qur'an 9: 26)

In al-Ji'hah 'Umar responded to the request of the wellknown Sahibi Ya'la ibn Umayyah at-Tameemi to see the Messenger
of Allah (g)
when he was receiving Revelation. It was narrated from
Safwb ibn Ya'la that Ya'la used to say, "I wish that I could see the
when (Revelation) is coming upon him."95

He said: (<Whilstthe Prophet (g)

came, wearing a jubbah and drenched in perfume, and said: "0'

ihrcim for 'Umrah wearing a jubbah and drenched with perfume?"
'Umar gestured to Ya'la, telling him to come, so Ya'la came, and saw
the prophet @)red in the face and breathing heavily. That continued
for a while, then it ceased and he said, "As for the perfnme, wash it
off three times, and as for the jubbah, take it off, then do in 'Umrah

another brought a handful of dates, another brought a piece of bread,
until a little food had been collected on a leather mat. Then the
Prophet @) prayed for barakah (blessing), and said, 'Fill your
vessels.' So they filled their vessels until there was no vessel left in
the camp that had not been filled, and they ate their fill and there was
plenty left over. The Messenger of Allah
said, 'I bear witness
that there is no god but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah.

believe in Allah, His angels, Paradise and Hell, the resurrection and
the divine will and decree, all of it (i.e., both good and bad)." He (the
man) asked, "What is ihsrin?" He said, "To strive for Allah as if you
can see Him, but even though you cannot see Him, He sees you." He
asked, "When will the Hour come?" He (the Prophet) answered,
"The one who is being asked about it does not h o w more than the
one who is asking." He asked, "What are its portents?" He said,
"When the naked, barefoot, destitute shepherds compete in
constructing tall buildings, and when the slave women give birth to
their masters."106Then he said: "Call the man back." They looked
for him but they could not find him. Two or three days passed, then

belonged to the AwSlr of Banu an-NajjSlr. I went around it looking for
a gate but I did not iind one, but I saw a spring running through the
garden, so I squeezed through the hole through which the spring
flowed. I met the Messenger of Allah @) and he said, "Abu
Hurayrah?" I said, 'Yes, OO' Messenger of ah." He asked, "What
is the matter with you?" I said, "You were amongst us, then you went
away for a long time, and we got worried about you. I was the first
one to come and look for you, so I came to this garden and squeezed
through (the hole) like a fox, and (the rest of) the people are behind
me." He said, "0' Abu Hurayrah," giving me his sandals, "take these
sandals of mine and whoever you meet outside the garden who bears
witness that there is no god but Allah, believing it with certainty in
his heart, give him the glad tidings of Paradise." The first one whom
I met was 'Umar, and he asked, "What are these sandals, 0' Abu
Hurayrah?" I said, 'These are the sandals of the Messenger of Allah
&). He has sent them with me and whomever I meet who bears
witness that there is no god but Allah, believing it with c e h n t y in
his heart, I am to give him the glad tidings of Paradise." 'Umar stmck
me on the chest with his hand and I fell on my backside. He said, "Go
back, 0' Abu Hurayrah." So I went back to the Messenger of Allah
@) and I started to weep, and 'Umar followed me. The Messenger of
Allah &J again asked, "What is the matter with you, 0' Abu

Hurayrah?" I said, "I met 'Umar and I told him what you had sent me
to do.'' Then he hit me on the chest and I fell on my backside and he
said, 'Go back'." The Messenger of Allah &)asked, "0' 'Umar,
what made you do that?" He said, "0' Messenger of Allah, did you
send Abu Hurayrah with your sandals to give glad tidings of Paradise
to whomever he met who bore witness that there is no god but Allah,
believing it with certainty in his heart?" He (the Prophet) said, "Yes."
He said, "Do not do that, for I fear that the people will rely on that.
Let them strive hard instead." The Messenger of AUah
said,
"(Yes), let them do that.">)'O9

2.2.3. The Prophet's keenness for the S@bah
to acquire knowledge from one source
It was narrated fkom J2bir ibn 'Ahdullih that: ((The Prophet

(g)saw a page of the Torah in 'Umar's hand and said, "Are you
crazy, 0' son of al-KhaGb? What I have brought to you is pure and
white. If Moosa were alive he would not but follow me." According
to another report: "If Moosa were alive and you followed him and
forsook me, you would go astray.""0

2.2.4. The Messenger of Allah (g)
speaks
of the beginning of creation
It was narrated that T%iq ibn Shih2b said: ctI heard 'Umar

say, "The Prophet @@ stood up amongst us and told us about
the beginning of creation, and until the people of Paradise took their
places and the people of Hell took their places. Those who

This hadith speaks of the meeting witb Allah, which is a concept that
'Umar learned from the Messenger of Allah WJ.

2.2.5. The Messenger of AUah (g)
forbade
swearing by one's forefathers and urged

putting one's tmst in AUah
It was narrated from 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar (&) that: cc'Umar
ihn al-Khatjib said: I heard the Messenger of ~ l l a h - asay,
) "Allah
forbids you to swear by your forefathers." 'Umar said, "By Allah, I
never swore by them since I heard the Messenger of Allah @)

my own behalf or narrating what someone else had said."'12 And
'Umar heard the Prophet of AUah say: ('If your were to put your
trust in Allah as you should, you would he given provision like the
birds, who go out in the morning hungry and come back in the
evening with full stomachs."~"~

2.2.6. "I am pleased with Allah as my Lord,
Islam as my religion and with Muhammad

It was namted from Ibn 'Abb& (&) that: ccA man came to
'Umar ibn al-KhaGb and said, "A woman came to me to offer
allegiance and I took her into a small room and did something with
her that was less than intercourse." He said, "Woe to you, probably
her husband is away (fighting in jihad) for the sake of Allah." Then
words of Qur'an were revealed:
(And perform as-Salih [Iqdmat as-Salrih], at the two ends of the day
and in some hours of the night [i.e. the five compulsory Salit
(prayers)]. Verily, the good deeds remove the evil deeds [i.e. small
sins]. That is a reminder [an advice] for the mindful [those who
accept advice].)
(Qurhn 11: 114)
He said, "0' Messenger of Allah, is it just for me or for all the

said, "No, not at all rather it is for all the people." And the Messenger

2.2.8. Ruling on one who takes back his charity
It was narrated that 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b said: cc"1 provided a
mount for the sake of Allah, but its owner neglected it. I wanted to
buy it back and I thought that he would sell it cheaply. But I said, (I
will not do anything) until I ask the Messenger of AUah (gJ. He (the
Prophet) said, "Do not buy it, even if he gives it to you for a dirham,
for the one who takes back his charity is like the dog that goes hack to
its vomit."))"8

2.2.9. His charity and waqfs
It was narrated ftom Ibn 'Umar (&) that: cc'Umar gave some
property ofhis in charity at the time of the Messenger of Allah @J.
- It
was called Thamgh and there were date palm trees there. 'Umar said:
"0'Messenger of Allah, I have acquired some property which is very
dear to me, and I want to give it in charity." The Prophet &) said,
"Give it in charity (as an endowment) on the condition that it will not
be sold, given away or inherited, and its yields will be spend (on
charitable purposes)." So 'Umar gave it in charity, and that gift of his
was given for the sake of Allah, for (emancipation of) slaves, the
poor, guests, wayfarers and kinsmen. There would be no sin on its
administrator if he ate from it on a reasonable basis or fed his fiends,
without intending to become wealthy by its means.nHg
According to another report: ccCUmaracquired some land in

This attitude clearly demonstrates the virtue of 'Umar and his
eagerness to do good deeds, and how he preferred the life of the
Hereafter to the transient life of this world.

2.2.10. The Prophet's gifts to
'Umar ibn al-KhatJSb and his son
It was narrated that Ibn 'Umar said: crCUmarsaw a man
wearing a hullah (suit) of brocade. He brought it to the Prophet &)
and said: "0'Messenger of Allah, why don't you buy this and wear it
to meet the delegations of the people when they come to you." He
said, "Silk is only wom by those who have no share (in the

him. He brought it to the Prophet (B)and said, "You sent this to me

2.2.11. 'Umar's encouragement to his son
and glad tidings to Ibn Mas'ood
It was m t e d from 'Abdull& ibn 'Umar (&) that: ((The
Messenger of Allah WJ said, "Among trees there is one whose
leaves do not f d , and it is like the Muslim. Tell me what it is." The
people started to suggest different kinds of desert trees. I thought to
myself that it was the date-palm tree, but I felt too shy (to speak up).
They said, "0' Messenger of Allah, tell us what it is." The
Messenger of Allah (#J said, "It is the date palm." 'Abdullih said, "I
told my father what I had thought of, and he sa~d,'If you had said
that, it would have been dearer to me than if I had such and
such.' "))125
As for 'Umar's glad tidings to Ibn Mas'ood, 'Umar (&)
narrated that: ((He stayed up late one night in the house of Abu Bakr
with the Messenger of Allah (@), discussing the affairs of the
Muslims. The Messenger of Allah @) went out, and we went out

had the upper hand over our women, but when we came to Madeenah
we found a people whose women had the upper hand over them, and
our women started learning i?om them. My house was among Banu
Urnayyah ibn Zayd in al-'Awili. One day I got angry with my wife,
and to my surprise she started answering me back. I objected to that
and she said, "Don't you like me answering you back? The wives of
the Prophet @) answer him back and one of them may forsake him
all day until night comes." So I went to Hafsah and asked, "Do you
She said, "Yes." I
answer back to the Messenger of Allah
said, "Does one of you forsake him all day until night comes?" She
said, "Yes." I said, "The one who does that is lost and doomed. Do
you think that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger
ofthe Messenger of Allah @)?
- Then she will indeed be doomed. Do
not answer back to the Messenger of Allah or ask him for anything.

among the Ansir, and we used to take it in turns to go down to the
Messenger of Allah - He would go down one day and bring me
news of the Revelation and other things, and I would go down the
next day and do likewise. We had been saying that Ghassin were
shoeing their horses in order to attack us, and my neighbour went
down one day, then he came to me in the evening and knocked on my
door, then he called me and I went out to him. He said, "Something
serious has happened!" I said, 'What is it? Have Ghassk come?" He
said, "No, it is worse than that: the Messenger has divorced his
wives." I said, "Hafsah is lost and doomed. I thought that this was
going to happen." When I had prayed Fajr I got dressed and went to
Hafsah, I went inside her house and she was weeping. I asked, "Has
the Messenger of Allah &) divorced you?" She said, "I do not
know. He has secluded himself in this small room." I went to a black

for a while, but I felt too upset. I went back to the slave and said,
"Ask for permission for 'Umar to enter." The slave went in, then he

have you divorced your wives?" He raised his head and looked at
me, and said, "No." I said, "Alldhu Akbar. Do you remember, 0'

Then she will indeed be doomed.' " The Messenger of Allah
smiled and I said, "0' Messenger of Allah, I went to HafSah and said,
'Do not be upset because your neighbour is more beautiful and more
beloved to the Messenger of Allah @) than you are.' " He smiled
again and I said, 'May I sit down, 0' Messenger of Allah?" He said,
"Yes." So I sat down, and I started looking around the room, and by
Allah there was nothiig to see except three untanned skins. I said,
"0' Messenger of Allah, pray to Allah to bestow more bounty upon
your ummah, for the Persians and the Byzantines have been given
great bounty and they do not worship Allah." He sat up straight then

These are the reports that I was able to collect about the life of
'Umar in the society of Madeenah. 'Umar was praised highly by the
Messenger of Allah @) which is indicative of his virtue, religious
commitment and knowledge. We will discuss that more below.

2.4. Some of his virtues
'Umar ibn d-Kha@h was second to Abu Bakr in virtue, and
he was the best of all people after the Prophets, Messengers and Abu
Bakr. This is what the Muslim must believe about the virtue of
'Umar, and this is the belief of the saved group, Ah2 as-Sunnah wa alJami 'ah.134There are many well known ahideeth and reports which
speak of the virtues of 'Umar, including the following:

2.4.1. His faith, knowledge and religious commitment
Concerning the status of his faith, 'Abdulliih ibn Hishim said:
((We were with the Prophet @J and he was holding the hand of
'Umar ibn al-Khanib. 'Umar said to him, "0' Messenger of Allah,
you are more beloved to me than anything except my own self." The
Prophet @) said, "No, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, not
until I am more beloved to you than your own self." 'Umar said to

him, "No, by Allah, you are more beloved to me than my own self."
The Prophet (&J said, "Now (you have got it right), 0 mar."))'^^

With regard to his knowledge, the Messenger of Allah &)
said: (<''Whilst I was sleeping (i.e., in a dream), I drank some milk
until I could see its wetness emerging from my fingertps, then I
passed it to 'Umar." They asked, "How did you interpret that, 0'
Messenger of Allah?" He said, "(It refers to)
This
is a metaphor, for milk and knowledge share the characteristics of
being very beneficial and bringing soundness, for milk brings
physical nourishment and knowledge brings spiritual nourishment.
This hadith highlights the virtues of 'Umar, for dreams are not
usually to be interpreted literally, even though the dreams of the
Prophets are part of the Revelation. But some of them need to be
mterpreted m a way other than their apparent meaning, whilst others
may be interpreted literally. What is meant by knowledge in this
hadith is understanding of how to rule people according to the Book
This applies
of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah
especially to 'Umar because of the length of his reign in comparison
to Abu Bakr, the people were also united in obeying him, in contrast
to 'Uthmin. The duration of Abu Bakr's caliphate was very short and
not many conquests took place during that time, whlch were the main
causes of division and differences. 'Umar's reign was very long and
there were many conquests, but 'Umar ruled in a way that prevented
division and differences, and nobody opposed him even though he
ruled for a long time. The conquests went even further during the
caliphate of 'Uthmh, but different ideas and views began to spread,
and ' U t h h did not enjoy the obedience that 'Umar had enjoyed,
which led to tribulations that ultimately ended in his murder. He was
succeeded by 'Ali, and the division and tribulation only got worse.

The Qur'anic Education of 'Umar ibn al-Khanrib

With regard to 'Umar's religious commitment, the Messenger
of Allah (g)
said: c<"WhilstI was sleeping, the people were shown to
me and they were wearing garments, For some of them the garment
came down only as far as the chest, and some were shorter than that.
And 'Umar was shown to me; he was wearing a garment that he was
dragging (along the ground)." They asked, "How did you interpret
that, 0' Messenger of Allah?" He said, "(It refers to) religious
~ommitment."~~'~~

2.4.2. People were afraid of him
and so was the Shaytlin
It was narrated that Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq2s (&) said: cc'Umar
ibn al-Khagb sought permission to see the Messenger of Allah
There were some women of Quraysh with him who were taking to
him and asking too many questions, raising their voices above his.
When 'Umar ibn al-Khagb asked for permission to enter, they ran
and hid. The Messenger of Allah
gave him permission to enter,
smilmg. He
so 'Uma came in and found the Messenger of Allah @EJ
said, "May Allah make you smile always, 0' Messenger of Allah."
The Prophet &)said, "I am surprised about these women who were
with me. When they heard your voice, they ran and hid." 'Umar said,
"You have more right to be feared by them, 0' Messenger of Allah."
Then 'Umar said, "0' enemies of yourselves! Do you fear me and not
the Messenger of Allah?" They said, "Yes, you are more harsh and
more stem than the Messenger of Allah." The Messenger of Allah
&) said, "0' son of al-KhatJiib, by the One in Whose hand is my
soul, the ShayfEn never meets you on a path but he takes another
path."))'38

131

This hadith points to the virtue of 'Umar and demonstrates
how, because of his constant adherence to the truth, the Shuytcin
could not find a way to have any influence on him.139
Ibn Hajar said: "This virtue means that the Shaytcin had no
influence over 'Umar, but that does not mean that he was infallible.
Rather the hadith only says that the Shaytcin would not walk on the
same path as 'Umar. This does not mean that he did not whisper to
him as much as he could. If it is said that we may conclude from this
hadith that the Shayfcin was not able to whisper to him, because if the
Shaytdn was prevented kom walking on a path where 'Umar was, it
is more likely that he wouldnot be able to get so close as to be able to
whisper to him, and so 'Umar was protected from the Shaytan, still
that does not necessarily mean that he was infallible, because
infallibility is certain in the case of a Prophet, and is merely a
possibility in the case of anyone else."

In the hadith of Haf~ahthat is narrated by at-Tab& in alAwsat it says: (<''TheShaytcin has never met 'Umar kom the time he
became Muslim, but he flees immediately.")>This is indicative of his
steadfastness in religious commitment, and his serious and firm
adherence to the truth.
An-Nawawl said: "This hadith is to be understood according
to its apparent meaning, that the ShayGn fled whenever he saw him."
'Iyid said: "It is to be understood by way of analogy, meaning that
'Umar had lei3 the path of Shayfin and followed the right path, so he
went against everything that the Shaytri;n loves." Ibn Hajar said: "The
first interpretation is more correct."140

2.4.3. The inspired one of this ummah
The Messenger of AUah (@Jsaid: ccC'Amongthe nations who
came before you were some who were inspired. If anyone among my
ummah were to be inspired it would be mar."^'^^ This hadith
speaks of an important characteristic of 'Umar. The scholars differed
as to what was meant by the word muhaddath (translated here as
"inspired"). It was said that it meant one who is inspired, or one who
speaks the truth spontaneously, or one to whom the angels speak
without him being a Prophet, i.e., they speak to him in his heart even
though he does not see an angel in reality, which boils down to
meaning inspired. And some suggested that it referred to intuition.'42
Ibn Hajar said: "The fact that on many occasions during the
lifetime of the Prophet &) 'Umar's suggestions were corroborated
by Qur'an, and afier the death of the Prophet @) he often got things
right by intuition, and that he was the only one who was honoured
with this quality and that other Sahiibah were not, does not mean that
he is better than Abu Ba!u (.L&,)."'~~
Ibn al-Qayyim said: "Do not think that the fact that this quality
was unique to 'Umar means that he was better than Abu Bakr qSiddeeq. Rather the fact that Abu Ba!u did not have this quality was
better than having it, for he had leamed so much ftom the Prophet
that he had no need of any inspiration or intuition. What Abu
Bakr had learned directly &om the Prophet
was better than that
which 'Umar learned by means of inspiration."144

2.4.4. "I had never seen anyone
so strong doing this task"
The Messenger of Allah &) said: cc"Whi1st I was sleeping, I
saw myself drawing water from a well with a bucket. Abu Bakr came
and drew a bucket or two weakly. May Allah forgive him.145Then
'Umar ibn al-Khagb came and the bucket turned into a very large
one in his hands. I had never seen any one so strong doing this task,
all the people drank their fill and watered their camels that knelt
down there.">)146
This hadith speaks of an obvious virtue of 'Umar, as is reflected in
the words of the Prophet @): "Then 'Umar ibn al-Khagb came and
the bucket turned into a vety large one in his hands..." The word
translated here as "strong" refers to a leader, or it was said that it
refers to something above which there is nothing else. "Watered their
camels" means that the people gave their camels water to drink, then
they returned to the pens into which they used to go aRer drinking in
saw is an obvious
order to rest. This dream that the Prophet
analogy to what happened to Abn Bakr and 'Umar during their
caliphates, how they strove well, directed the course of events and
benefited the people. During the caliphate of Abu Bakr there was
fighting with the apostates (ahl ar-riddah);he put a stop to them and
spread Islam despite the short duration of his caliphate, which lasted
only two years and a few months. But Allah blessed it greatly and
created a great deal of benefit in it. When Abu Bakr died, he was
succeeded by 'Umar, during whose time Islam spread even further...

caliphate of 'Umar because it was so lengthy. 'Umar established new
cities and organized the affairs of state, and there were many
conquests and a great deal of booty.
What is meant by the phrase "I had never seen any one so
strong doing this task" is: I had never seen any leader striving so hard
and achieving so much. With regard to the meaning of the words, "all
the people drank their fill", al-Q&li 'Ayysd said: ''This seems to refer
to the caliphate of 'Urnar in particular, although it was said that it
refers to the caliphates of both Abu Bakr and 'Umar, because of their
thinking and management, and their efforts to serve the interests of
the Muslims. This was achieved and 'all the people drank their fill'
because Abu Bakr defeated the apostates and united the Muslims,
and he initiated the conquests and paved the way, and his efforts bore
fruit during the time of 'Umar ibn al-~hat&?b."'~"

2.4.5. The protective jealousy of 'Umar and the

glad tidings that the Messenger of AUah (g)
gave him of a palace in Paradise
The Messenger of Allah &)
- said: (("I saw myself (in a dream)
entering Paradise, and there I saw ar-Rumaysa' - the wife of Abu
Tulayw -and I heard the sound of footsteps. I said, 'Who is this?'
He said, 'It is Bilil.' And I saw a palace, in the courtyard of which
there was a young woman. I said, 'Whose (palace) is this?' They said,
'(It is) 'Umar's.' I wanted to go in and look around, but then I
remembered your protective jealousy.' " 'Umar sa~d,"May my father
and mother be sacrificed for you, 0' Messenger of Allah! Would I
feel jealous towards yo~?")~148

Messenger of Allah (@)
'Abdullih ibn Zam'ah said: <<Whenthe Messenger of AUah
&) fell sick, Bilil entered upon him to call him to come and pray. He
said: "Tell someone to lead the people in prayer." So I went out
and saw 'Umar among the people, and Abu Bakr was not there, so I
said, "Get up, 0' 'Umar, and lead the people in prayer." So he got up,
and when he said the takbeer, the Messenger of Allah &)heard his
voice, for 'Umar was a man who had a loud voice. The Messenger of
Allah &) said, "Where is Abu Bakr? For Allah would not accept
that andneither would the Muslims, Allah would not accept that and
neither would the Muslims." He sent for Abu Bakr, who came after
'Umar had finished that prayer, and he led the people in prayer.
'Ahdull* ibn Zam'ah said that 'Umar said to him, 'Woe to you!
What have you done to me, 0' Ibn Zam'ah? By AUah,when you told

me (to lead the prayer), I thought that the Messenger of Allah a )
had enjoined that, otherwise I would not have led the people in
prayer." I said, "By Allah, the Messenger of Allah &) did not enjoin
thaf but when I did not see Abu Bakr, I thought that you were the
most deserving of those present to lead the people in prayer."))153
Ibn 'Abbb narrated that: (<Whenthe pain grew intense, the
Prophet (g)
said, "Bring me a sheet so that I may write something
for you after which you will not go astray." 'Umar (&) said, "The
Prophet
is in severe pain, and the Book of Allah is sufficient for
us." They started arguing and raising their voices. He said, "Go away
from me; it is not right that you should argue in front of me." Ibn
'Abbk went out saying, "It was most unfortunate that the Messenger
of Allah &) was prevented from writing his statement.">)154

a)

The scholars discussed this hadith and explained it in such a
way that puts one's mind at ease. An-Nawawi discussed it at length
and in detail in his commentary on Muslim, where he said:
"It should be noted that the Prophet &) was infallible and could not
lie or change any ofthe rulings of shari'ah, whether he was healthy or
sick. He was also protected against failing to explain anything that
needed explanation or conveying anything that Allah had
commanded him to convey. But he was not infallible against the
diseases and sicknesses to which the body is susceptible and other
such things that do not undermine his status and could not affect any
of the issues of shari'ah that were already established. He a ) was
bewitched and he imagined that he had done things that he had not
done, but when he was in that state, he did not suggest anything that
contradicted the rulings that he had previously established. Once you
understand the point we are making, the scholars differed concerning

the statement that the Prophet
wanted to write. It was said that he
wanted to state that the caliphate should go to a specific person lest
there be disputes and tribulations conceming it; or that he wanted to
write something m which he would sum up the most important
rulings, so as to dispel the risk of dispute concerning them and so that
there would be agreement upon what was stated. The Prophet @)
thought of writing this statement because it seemed to him thaiit
would serve a purpose, or be had received revelation telling him to do
that. Then it appeared that it was better not to do that, or he received
revelation to that effect, so the first command was abrogated.
With regard to the words of 'Umar, the scholars who commented on
this hadith are unanimously agreed that this is indicative of 'Umar's
knowledge of religion, virtues and subtle insight, because he feared
that the Prophet @) might write things that may be beyond them, for
which they would incur punishment, because these matters would be
clearly stated and there would be no room for ijtihad concerning
them. This is why 'Umar said, 'The Book of Allah is sufficient for

us,' because Allah (g)

d... We have neglected nothing in the Book...)

(Qur'an 6: 38)

And:
d... This day, I have perfected your religion for you ...) (Qurhn 5: 3)
He knew that Allah bad perfected His religion and that the ummah
was safe kom misguidance, so he wanted to spare the Messenger of
Allah &J any further effort. 'Umar had better insight than Ibn
'Abbb and those who shared his view. Al-Khasbi said: It is not
permissible to interpret what 'Umar said as meaning that he thought
that the Messenger of Allah &) might make a mistake, or some
other inappropriate notion. Rather when he saw that the Messenger of
Allah (@) was in great pain and that death was approaching, he
feared that this was akin to the talk of a sick person who does not
speak in a definitive manner, and that the hypocrites would take this

'Umar ibn al-Khattkb

as a means to criticize Islam. His companions used to discuss some
matters with him before he confirmed them in definitive terms, as
happened on the day of al-bdaybiyah concerning the treaty between
him and Quraysh. But when the Prophet (g)
issued a command he
did so in definitive terms, and none of them would discuss it with
him,n155
'Umar's words, "The Book of AUah is suEcient for us" were
a response to those who were arguing with him, not to the command

saying: 'What I-&& is that during his lengthy companionship with
the Prophet

'Bring me a sheet so that I may write something for you', 'Umar as was his usual habit offered his suggestion, saying that the Book
of Allah was sufficient, and the Prophet
agreed with him. If he
had wanted to go ahead and write the statement, he would have told
'Umar to be quiet and he would have done what he wanted."15'

came as a great shock to many of the Muslims, especially 'Umar ibn
al-Khagb. The great Sahribi Abu Hurayrah (&) tells us what
happened:
((Whenthe Messenger of Allah @) died, 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b stood
up and said, "Some of the hypocrites are claiming that the Messenger
of Allah has died, but the Messenger of Allah @)has not died, rather
he has gone to his Lord as Moosa ibn 'hrh did; he went away kom
his people for forty days, then he came back to them after it was said
that he had died. By Allah, the Messenger of Allah will come back to
us as Moosa came back. Let the hands and feet of those who say that
the Messenger of Allah (g)
has died be cut off."158
When he heard the news, Abu B a k came and dismounted at the door
of the mosque whilst 'Umar was still speaking to the people, and he
did not pay attention to anything until he went to the Messenger of
Allah &) in the house of 'kishah, and the Messenger of Allah @gJ
was lying, fully covered with a striped cloak, in a comer of the room.
He went and uncovered the face of the Messenger of Allah @) and
kissed him, then he said, 'May my father and mother be sacrificed for
you. As for the death that Allah has decreed for you, you have tasted
it, and no death will ever befall you again after this." Then he put the
cloak back over the face of the Messenger of Allah (@), and went
out. 'Umar was still speaking to the people and he said, "Calm down
and listen, 0' 'Umar!" But 'Umar insisted on speaking, and when
Abu Bakr saw that he would not listen, he turned to the people &d
when the people heard him speaking, they turned to him and left
'Umar. (Abu Bakr) praised and glorified Allah, then he said:

"0' people, whoever used to worship Muhammad, Muhammad has
died, but whoever used to worship Allah, Allah is Living and will
never die." Then he recited the following verse:
As-Seerah an-Nabawiyah by fin Abi Shaybah, 21594

#Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed [many]
Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will
you then turn back on your heels [as disbelievers]? And he who turns
back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to AUah; and Allah
(Qur 'an 3: 144)
will give reward to those who are grateful.)
Abn Hurayrah said, "By Allah, it was as if the people did not know
that this verse had been revealed until Abu Bakr recited it to them that
day. The people learned it &om Abu Bakr and now it is on their lips."
Abu Hurayrah said, " 'Umar said, 'By Allah, when Abu Bakr recited
it I began to feel dizzy and my legs would not cany me, and I fell to
the ground. And I knew that the Messenger of Allah (g)
had
died.'"))159

'Umar ibn al-Khat@b and Abu 'Ubaydah ihn al-Jarriih went to them,
and 'Umar started to speak, but Abu Bakr told him to be quiet. 'Umar
used to say: "I3y Allah, all I wanted to do was to say some words that
I had prepared in my mind that I thought were good, for I was a h i d
that Abu Bakr might not be able to convey the message effectively."
Then Abu Bakr began to speak, and he spoke very eloquently. He
said: "We will be the leaders and yon will be the advisors." Habbih

ibn al-Mundhir said: "No, by Allah, we will not do it. A leader fiom

we will be the leaders and you will be the advisors. They are the most
prominent among the Arabs and the best in lineage. Give your

to one of the Ansir, which would cause great tribulation, and it would
not be easy to resolve the matter once people had started to swear
allegiance to someone else - then he hastened to pre-empt any

On the Tuesday, Abu Bakr sat on the minbar, and 'Umar stood
up and spoke before Abu Bakr. He praised and glorified Allah as He
deserves, then he said: "0' people, yesterday I said things to you that
were not appropriate; I did not find that in the Book of Allah and that
was not something that the Messenger of Allah @) told me. But I
thought that the Messenger of Allah @) would continue to lead us
until he would be the last one of us to die. But Allah has lei? amongst
you His Book in which is the guidance of Allah and His Messenger

guided him. Allah has united you under the leadership of the best
among you, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah @), the
second of two when they were in the cave, so get up and swear your
allegiance to him." So the people swore their allegiance to Abu Bakr
in a public oath of allegiance that took place after the oath of
allegiance at as-~a~eefah.'"'Umar encouraged the people and urged
them to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr until Allah united all the
Muslims under his leadership. Thus Allah saved them kom division
and tribulation. This is the stance that 'Umar took with the people in
order to unite them under the leadership of Abn Bakr. This is one of
the wisest stances which deserves to be recorded in letters of gold.165
'Umar feared that the Muslims would become divided and that
the flames of internal division would empt, so he took pre-emptive
action by hastening to swear allegiance to Abu Bakr and he
encouraged the people to do likewise in a public oath of allegiance.
This action ofhis saved the Muslims i?om the greatest tribulation that
would have befallen them were it not for his brilliant intuition, which

of Allah (g,),
Allah, when I saw that Allah had opened Abu Bakr's heart to (the
idea of) fighting, I knew that it was right."^'^'
When some of the Sahibah suggested to Abu Bakr that the
army of U s m should stay put until things had calmed down,
U s h a h sent a message with 'Umar ibn al-KhaMb from his camp at
al-Jaraf to Abu Bakr, asking him for permission to bnhg the people
back. He said: "There are some of the most prominent and most
respected Muslims with me, and I fear for the successor of the
Messenger of Allah (i.e., the caliph) and the wives of the Messenger
of Allah and the Muslims, that they may be harmed by the

he should go ahead with his military campaign and set out towards
Syria, no matter what the circumstances or the outcome. The Ansiir

requested that a man older than Usshould be put in command of
the army, and they sent 'Umar ibn al-Khagh to talk to Abu Bakr
about that. 'Umar said: "The Anv2r are requesting that a man older
than U s h a h should be put in command of the army." Abu Bakr had
been sitting down but he leapt up and grabbed 'Umar by the beard
and said: "May your mother be bereft of you, 0' son of al-KhaGb!
The Messenger of Allah (@) appointed him and you are telling me to
dismiss him?"'69 'Umar went out to the people and they said: "What
did you do?" He said: "Go away, may your mothers be bereft of you!

Mu%& ibn Jabal stayed in Yemen during the lifetime of the
where he strove hard in calling people to
Messenger of Allah (g),
Islam and in fighting the apostates. After the Messenger of AUah (@)
died, he came to Madeenah. 'Umar said to Abu Bakr, "Send for this
man and leave him with enough for him to live on but take everything
sent him to
else from him." Abu Bakr said: "No, the Prophet
help him; I will not take anything from him except what he gives to
me." 'Umar thought that Abu Bakr (&) was not taking any notice of
his opinion, but 'Umar was convinced that he was right. He went to

rejecting 'Umar's advice. 'Umar knew that he had no power over

his duty of offering advice. But after rejecting 'Umar's advice,
Mu'Mh saw something that made him go to 'Umar and say: "I will
obey you, I will do what you told me to do, for I saw in a dream that I
was in deep water and I feared that I might drown, but you saved me
from it, 0''Umar." Then Mu'idh went to Abu Bakr (&) and told
him the whole story, and swore that he was not hiding anything from
him. Abu Bakr (&) said: "We will not take anything that has been
given to you as a gift." l7' According to another report, Abu Bakr
said to M u ' k k "Give us your accounts." Mu'idh said: "Am I to

Abu Muslim al-Khawlhi
'Umar was blessed with a kind of intuition which is rarely seen
in this life. Adh-Dhahabi narrated that al-Aswad alL'Ansi was
claiming to be a Prophet in Yemen. He sent for Abu Muslim alKhawlhi and prepared a great lire, then he threw Abu Muslim into it,
but it did not h a m him... It was said to al-Aswad, "If you do not get
rid of him, he will confuse your followers." So he told him to leave,
and he came to Madeenah. He made his mount kneel down, then he
entered the mosque, where 'Umar saw him and got up to meet him.

He asked, 'Where is this man from?" He said, "From Yemen." He
asked, "What happened to the one whom the liar burned with fre?"
He said, "That was 'Abdnllih ibn Thuwab." He then asked, "I adjure

embraced him and wept, then he took him and seated him between
himself and Abu Bakr and said, "Praise be to Allah Who did not

concerning the one whom he wanted to send to Bahrain. 'Uthmin
said to him: "Send a man whom the Messenger of Allah @g)
sent
before, who had brought his people to the Prophet (@) to declare
their Islam and obedience, whom they know and he knows them."
And he also said: "Force Abin ibn Sa'eed ibn al-'AS (to be
govemor), for he is a man who had an alliance with them," But Abu
Bakr refused to force him, and said: "I will not force any man who
says that he will not work for anyone after the Messenger of Allah
@)." Then Abn Bakr decided to send al-'Ala' ibn al-H-i

3.4. 'Umar's view that diyah should not be
accepted for the slain Muslims, and his
objection to Abu Bakr giving land to
al-Aqra' ibn Hiibis and 'Uyaynah ibn Hasan
3.4.1. 'Umar's view that diyah should not be accepted
for the Muslims slain during the Riddah wars
The delegation of Buz2khah came from Asad and Ghawfan to
Abn Bakr to ask him for a peace treaty, and he gave them the choice
between a destructive war and a humiliating peace. They said: "We
know what destruction means, but what is this humiliation?" He
said: "We will take away ftom you your weapons and horses, we will
keep as war booty whatever we captured ftom you, and you will
return whatever you captured from us. You will pay diyah for our
slain, but your slain are in Hell. You will be left like people who
follow the tails of camels until Allah shows the successor of His
Messenger &) and the Muhbjireen a way to forgive you." Abu Bakr
told the ~ a f z i b a hwhat he had said, and 'Umar ibn al-Khasb stood
up and said: "I will give you my opinion. As for what you said about
a destructive war or a humiliating peace, that is a good idea. As for
what you said about us keeping as war booty what we captured ftom
them and them returning what they captured from us, that is a good
idea. As for what yon said about them paying the diyah for our slain
and their slain being in Hell, our slain fought and were killed for the
sake of Allah, and their reward is with Allah, so there should be no
diyah for them." So he concluded the treaty with them on the basis of
what 'Umar said.175

3.4.2. His objection to Abu Bakr giving land to
al-Aqra' ibn HSbis and 'Uyaynah ibn H a ~ a n
'Uyaynah ibn Hqan and al-Aqra' ibn H2bis came to Abu Bakr
(&) and said: "0' Successor of the Messenger of Allah &), there is
some swampy land where no grass grows and it is of no use. Why
don't you give it to us to cultivate it, so that perhaps there will be
some benefit in it after today?" Abu Bakr said to those who were
around him, "What do you think of what they said, if it is swampy
land that is of no use?" They said, 'We think that you should give it
to them, so that perhaps there will be some benefit in it after today."
So he gave it to them and wrote a document for them stating that it
was theirs. He wanted 'Umar to witness it, but he was not among the
people, so they went to 'Umar and asked him to bear witness. They
found him applying pitch to a camel of his and said, "Abu Bakr has
asked you to bear witness to what is in this document. Shall we read it
to you or will you read it?" He said, "I am as you see I am, if you
wish you can read it and if you wish you can wait until I am finished
and I will read it myself." They said, 'No, we will read it." So they
read it and when he heard what was in the document, he took it from
their hands, then he spat on it and wiped it (i.e., obliterated what was
written). They complained about that and said something bad. He
said, "The Messenger of Allah &) used to be kind to you, and Islam
was in a weak position at that-time. Now Allah has made Islam
strong, so go and work hard. May you never succeed if you graze
your flocks in that land!" They went to Abu Bakr and started to
complain, saying, "By Allah, we do not know if you are the caliph or
'Umar." He said, "No, he could have been the caliph if he had
wanted to be." Then 'Umar came, and he was angry. He stood over
Abu Bakr and said, "Tell me about this land that you gave to these
two. Is it your own land or does it belong to all the Muslims?" He
said, "No, it belongs to all the Muslims." He said, 'Then what made

150

The Qur 'anic Education of 'Umar ibn al-Khagtb

you give it to these two only and not to all the Muslims?" He said, "I
consulted these people who were around me and that is what they
advised me to do." He said, "If you consulted those who were around
you, did you consult all the other Muslims, and were they pleased
with it?" Abu Bakr (4)
said, "I told you that you were more
qualified for this role than I, but you insisted."'76
This incident leaves no room for doubt that the rule of the
Islamic state at the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs was based on
shoora or consultation. It shows us that the successor to the
Messenger of Allah (g)was keen to consult the Muslims concerning
both minor and major matters, and that he would not take any
decision without consulting his brothers.'"
The report quoted above shows us that shoora was practised in
all decisions concerning the Muslims' affairs and, moreover, that
Abu Bakr would be willing to surrender his opinion, even though he
was who he was. This is a picture of shoora as it should be, within the
h e w o r k of the commands of Allah and the rulings on what is ha121
and what is harrim. It is not the pseudo-shoora that is enacted in
parliaments from which the people have gained nothing but the
bitterness of oppression, injustice and 1 0 ~ s . ' ~ ~

3.5. The compilation of the Holy Qur'an
Among the Muslims who were martyred during the war of alY a m M were many who had memorized the Qur'an, as a result of
which Abu Bakr (4)
consulted 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb (4)
about

compiling the Qur'an by collecting the pieces of cloth, bones and
palm leaves on which it had been written and gathering it "from the
hearts of men".179 Abu Bakr delegated this extremely important task
to the Sahrfbi Zayd ibn Thibit al-Ans&. Zayd ibn Thibit (&) said:
cc"Ahu Bakr sent for me after many people were killed at al~ a m h a h . There
' ~ ~ I saw 'Umar ibn al-KhaMb with him. Abu Bakr
said that 'Umar came to him and said, 'The killing on the day of alYambah has taken its toll of those who had knowledge of the Holy
Qur'an, and I fear that more will be killed in other battles, and much
of the Qur'an may disappear. So I think that you should issue orders
that the Qur'an be compiled.' I said to 'Umar, 'How can I do
did not do?' 'Umar said,
something that the Messenger of Allah
'By AUah, this is something good. h mar kept on talking to me about
it until Allah opened my heart to that to which He had opened
'Umar's heart, and I realized the same as 'Umar had realized
concerning the matter.' " Zayd said that Abu Bakr said: "You are a
young and intelligent man and we think highly of you; you used to
write down the Revelation for the Messenger of AUab &). So seek
, he had
out the Qur'an and collect it." Zayd said: "By ~ l l a h if
ordered me to move a mountain it would not have been harder for me
than what he ordered me to do of collecting the ~ur'an.">>'~'

a)

We may derive a number of conclusions kom the story of the
collection of the Holy Qur'an, including the following:
1. That the collection of the Holy Qur'an came about as the result of
the fear that it might be lost because of the deaths, during the Riddah
wars, of many of those who knew it well. This indicates that the
scholars and those who had knowledge of the Qur'an at that time

were the quickest of people to act and engage in jihad to support
Islam and the Muslims with their ideas, behaviour and swords. They
were the best nation ever raised for mankind and all those who come
after them should follow their example.
2. The collection of the Qur'an was based on the general interests of
the Muslims. Nothing is more indicative of that than 'Urnar's reply
when Abu Bakr asked him, "How can you do something that the
Messenger of Allah (g)
did not do?" and he said, "By AUah, it is
something good." According to some versions, he said to him: "By
Allah it is good and in the interests of the Muslims." This is the same
thing that Abu Bakr said to Zayd when he asked the same question.
Whether the report which mention the interests of the Muslims is
faheeh or not, the usage of the word khayr ("good") conveys the
same meaning, which is that it was in the interests of the Muslims to
gatherthe Qur'an. The collecting of the Qur'an was initially based on
the general interests of the Muslims, after which consensus was
formed and everyone agreed with it, explicitly or implicitly. This
indicates that the general interests of the Muslims (al-mqlahah almursalah) may be taken as a sound basis for consensus with regard to
those scholars who believe that it is a valid foundation for some
actions.

3. This incident also shows us clearly how the Sahibah used to
discuss matters in a calm manner in an atmosphere of love and
respect and with the aim of achieving that which was in the general
Interests of the Muslims. It also shows that they would adopt the
sound view and be content with it after discussing the matter and
reaching their conclusions. Once they were convinced of an opinion
they would defend it as if it had been their view from the outset. In
this manner they formed consensus on many rulings of ijtihad.18'

see and I think I am going to die soon. Allah has freed you from your
oath of allegiance to me, and your oath is no longer binding. Your
affairs are in your hands, so appoint over you whomever you like. If
you appoint someone whilst I am still alive, I think it is less likely that
you will become divided after I am gone."1
The Sahribah consulted one another, each of them trying to
refuse the position of caliph for himself and seeking it for his brother
whom he thought was fit and qualified for it. Hence they came back

154

to him and said: "We have decided to leave it to you, 0' Successor
(khaleefah) of the Messenger of Allah &)." He said: "Give me time
so that I may choose someone who will be most pleasing to Allah,
most protective of His religion and His slaves." Then Abu Bakr
called 'Abdur-Rwan ibn 'Awf and said to him: "Tell me about
'Umar ibn al-KhatJiib." He said: "You do not ask me about a matter
but you have more knowledge of it than I." Abu Bakr said: "Even so
(tell me)." 'Abdur-Rsaid: "By Allah, he is better than you
think he is." Then he called 'Uthmh ibu 'Affan and said: "Tell me
about 'Umar ibn al-KhatJiib." He said: "You know better than I do."
He said: "Even so (tell me), 0' Abu 'Abdullih." 'Uthmk said: "By
Allah, what I know is that what he conceals is better than what he
shows outwardly, and there is no one else like h i among us." Abu
Bakr said: "May Allah have mercy on you, by Allah if I were not to
choose him I would not choose anyone but you." Then he called
Usayd ibn uudayr and asked him a similar question, and Usayd said:
"By Allah, 1know that he is best afier you. He is pleased with that
which pleases Allah and is angry with that which angers Allah, and
what he conceals is better than that which he shows outwardly. This
matter (the caliphate) will never pass to anyone who is more able for
it than him." He (Abu Bakr) also consulted Sa'eed ibn Zayd and a
number of the An& and Muhdjireen and almost all of them were of
one mind concerning 'Umar, except for T a w ibn 'Ubaydullih, who
was concerned about 'Umar's harshness and said to Abu Bakr
"What will you say to your Lord when He asks you about appointing
'Umar overus when you have seen how harsh he is?" Abu Bakr said:
"Sit me up. Are you trying to make me fear Allah? (Any ruler) who
does you wrong is doomed. I will say: '0' Allah, I appointed over
them the best of your people.' He explained to them the reason
why 'Umar was so harsh and strict and said: "That is because he

'Umar ibn al-Khanrib

155

thinks I am too soft and gentle; when he is in charge he will change a
great deal."3 Then he put in writing a document to be read to the
people of Madeenah and the Ansir by the commander of the army,
the text of which was as follows:

''In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
This is what has been decided by Abu Bakr ibn Ahi Q~&%ah at the
end of his life as he is departing this world and as he enters the
Hereafter, at the time (i.e., as death approaches) when kdfirs become
believers and evildoers become certain (of their fate). I was only
trymg to do good for the sake of Allah and His Messenger and His
religion and for myself and for you. If ('Umar) turns out to be fair and
just, then this is what I think and know him to be, but if he changes
then each person will be responsible for what he does. I intended
nothing but good, and I have no knowledge of the unseen.

B... And those who do wrong will come to know by what overturning
they will be overtnrned.)

( G r ' a n 26: 227)"

The appointment of 'Umar was the last advice that Abu Bakr
gave to the -ah.
He realized that the temptation of worldly
luxuries was becoming a reality and that the Muslims had lived a life
of poverty that he knew all too welt he knew that if these people saw
the luxuries of this world, they might indulge in their desires and thus
it would influence them and dominate them, and that was what the
Messenger of Allah &) had warned them againsL4 The Messenger
of Allah &)said: <<' ByAllah, it is not poverty that I fear for you,
rather my fear is that worldly luxury may become available to you as
it became available to those who came before you, and that you will
start competing in acquiring it as they competed and it will destroy

you as it destroyed them."n5 Abu Bakr understood the problem so he
was offering them an effective remedy... 'Umar was like a solid
mountain which, if worldly luxury saw him, it would despair of him
and flee. He was the man of whom the Prophet @) said: (("0'son of
al-Khagb, by the One in Whose hand is my soul, the ShaytLEn never
sees you coming on a path but he takes another path."))6
The grave events which the ummah passed through began with
the slaying of 'Umar. These adversities are the best testimony to the
intuition of Abu Bakr when he appointed 'Umar as his successor. It
was narrated that 'Abdullih ibn Mas'ood said: 'The most intuitive of
people were three: the lady who said of Prophet Moosa (m):

d... 0' my father! Hire him! Verily, the best of men for you to hire is
(Qur'an 28: 26)

- and Abu Bakr when he appointed 'Umar as his ~uccessor."~

'Umar was the dam that shielded the ummah kom the waves of

'Urnar also spoke of the steps that he was going to take. 'Umar came
to him, and Abu Bakr told him what he had decided to do concerning
his appointment. 'Urnar refused to accept it, and Abu Bakr threatened
him with the sword, so 'Umar had no choice but to accept? Abu Bakr
wanted to tell the people himself whilst he was conscious and aware

of what he was saying, so that there would be no confusion. So he
looked out over the people and said to them: "Do you accept the one
whom I appoint as your leader? For by Allah I have tned to appoint
the best; I have not appointed a relative. I have appointed as your
leader 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b, so listen to him and obey." They said:
"We will listen and obey. "lo Then Abu Bakr turned in du '6 'to Allah,
expressing his concerns to Him. He said: "I have appointed him not
by the command of Your Prophet, seeking nothing but what is in their
best interests. I fearfihah for them and I have thought long and hard
about the matter. I have appomted over them the best of them and the
one who is most keen to lead them in the right way. Now here I am
with Your decree about to be fulfilled. Take care of them after I am
gone for they are Your slaves.""
to read this will to the
Abu Bakr commanded 'Uthmin (4)
people and to receive their oaths of allegiance (bay'ah) to 'Umar
before Abu Bakr died, after sealing the will to give it more
authenticity and to ensure that this order would be &ed out without
any negative effects. 'Uthmin said to the people: 'Will you swear
allegiance the one who is named in this will?" They said: "Yes". So
they all accepted that and approved of it.'' ARer the will had been
read to the people and they had agreed to it, they turned to 'Umar and
gave him their oaths of allegiance.13Then Abu Bakr spent some time
alone with 'Umm and gave him some advice so as to absolve himself
of all responsibility and so that he could meet his Lord fiee fiom any
responsibility after having done his best.I4 Among the advice he gave

was the following: "Fear Allah, 0''Umar, and know that there are
some deeds to be done for Allah during the day, which He will not
accept at night, and some deeds to be done during the night which He
will not accept during the day; He does not accept any nafl deeds
until the obligatory duties have been done. Those whose deeds will
weigh heavily in the Balance on the Day of Resurrection will do so
only because of their following the tmth, thus they will become
heavy. And those whose deeds will weigh lightly in the Balance on
the Day of Resurrection will do so only because of theu following
falsehood, thus they will become light. Allah has mentioned the
people of Paradise and He mentions only the best of their deeds and
overlooks their bad deeds, and when I think of them I say: I fear that I
will not be one of them. And Allah has mentioned the people of Hell
and He mentions only the worst of their deeds, and rejects their good
deeds, and when I think of them I say: I hope that I wlll not be among
them. One should be hoping for Paradise and fearing Hell, without
having too much hope or despairing of the mercy of Allah. If you
listen to my advice, no absent thing will be more hateful to you than
death, but you cannot escape it."15
'Umar ibn al-Khacib started to act as the caliph of the
Muslims as soon as Abu Bakr (&) passed away.16
It may be noted that Abu Bakr's nomination of 'Umar ibn alKhatj2b could not have made him caliph unless it was based on the
consent of the majority. This was achieved when Abu Bakr asked the
people to look themselves for a successor to take the reins of
leadership after he died. They put the matter back in his hands and
said, we wl1 follow your opinion." But Abu Bakr did not nominate

'Umar until after consulting the most prominent Sahibuh. He asked
each one individually, and when he realized that they all agreed, he
announced his nomination of 'Umar. So Abu Bakr's choice was
based on the opinion of the ummah as expressed through its most
prominent figures. But this nomination could not make 'Umar the
caliph except with the ummah's consent, because the election of the
ruler is the right of the ummah, and the caliph is no more than an
agent who acts on behalf of the ummah, so he must have the consent
of those on whose behalf he is acting. Hence Abu Bakr turned to the
ummah and asked them: "Do you accept the one whom I appoint as
your leader? For by Allah I have tried to appoint the best; I have not
appointed a relative. I have appointed as your leader 'Umar ibn alKha@b, so listen to him and obey." They said: "We will listen and
obey."" The words of Abu Bakr, "Will you accept the one whom I
appoint as your leader?" indicate that the ummah is to control its own
affairs and that this is the business of the ummah.19
'Umar assumed the position of caliph by the consensus of the
decision makers, for they are the ones who delegated to Abu Bakr the
task of selecting the next caliph, and they made him their deputy in
that. So he consulted people, then he appointed the next caliph, then
he announced this appointment to the people and they approved it
and agreed with it. The decision makers in the ummah are the natural
representatives of the ummah. Hence we see that the appointment of
'Umar was done in accordance with the most sound and fair
principles of ~ h o o r a . ' ~
The steps which Abu Bakr took to appoint the caliph who
would succeed him did not go beyond the h e w o r k of shoora at all,

even though the procedure differed from that by means of which Abu
Bakr himselfwas elected.21Thus 'Umar was elected caliph by means
of shoora and consensus. History does not record any dispute that
arose concerning his caliphate after that; throughout his reign no one
stood up to dispute the matter, rather he became caliph by universal
acclaim and there was consensus that he was to be obeyed throughout
his rule. Thus they were all united."

1.2. Shar'i texts which indicate that 'Umar
was more entitled to the caliphate

-1In the Qur'an there are verses which point to the validity of the
caliphate of Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmin (may Allah be pleased
with them) and show that obedience to them was obligatory. AUah
said, addressing His Prophet &)conceming the Bedouin:

81f Allah brings you back to a party of them [the hypocrites], and they
ask your permission to go out [to fight], say, 'Never shall you go out
(Qur'an 9: 83)
with me nor fight an enemy with me' ...k
Soorah at-Tawbah was undoubtedly revealed after the
campaign of ~abook'~,from which the three who were forgiven
stayed behind, the acceptance of whose repentance was revealed in
Soorah at-Tuwbah. The Prophet
did not take part m any milita.ry
campaign after Tabook until he died. And Allah (&) said:

(Those who lagged behind will say, when you set forth to take the
spoils, 'Allow us to follow you.' They want to change Allah's Words.
Say, 'You shall not follow us; thus Allah has said beforehand.' ...)
(Qur 'an 48: 15)

This shows that the Bedouin were not to go out on military
campaigns with the Messenger of Allah &) after Tabook for this
reason. Then, after saying that they were not to go on campaigns with
the Messenger of Allah &), Allah says:
@ay 10' Muhammad] to the bedouins who lagged behmd, 'You shall
be called to fight against a people given to great warfare, then you
shall fight them or they shall surrender. Then if you obey, Allah will
give you a fair reward; but if you turn away as you did turn away
before, He will punish you with a painful torment.') (Qur bn 48: 16)
Here Allah is telling them that someone other than the Prophet @)
would call them to fight certain people or they surrender, and He
promised them a great reward ifthey obeyed the one who called them
to that, and warned them of a painful punishment if they disobeyed
the one who called them.24
Abu Muhammad ibn Harm said: "No one called these
Bedouins to 'fight certain people or they surrender' after the Prophet
@) except Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmh (may Allah be pleased
mth them). Abu Bakr (&) called them to fight the Arabs of Banu
Haneefah who had apostatized, the companions of al-Aswad, Saj%
and Tulayhah, and the Byzantines and Persians, and others. 'Umar
called them to fight the Byzantines and Persians, and ' U t h i n called
them to fight the Byzantines, Persians and ~ u r k s . ' ~SO lt was
obligatory to obey Abu Bala, 'Umar and 'Uthmk (may AUah be

Abu Bala S appointment of 'Umar as his successor

pleased with them) according to a clear and definitive text of the
Qur'an which could not be interpreted in any other way. If it was
obligatory to obey them, this means that their leadership and
caliphate was valid.26

a)

The Messenger of Allah
said: cct'Whilst I was sleeping, I
saw myself drawing water from a well with a bucket. Abu Bakr came
and drew a bucket or two weakly. May Allah forgive him. Then
'Umar ibn al-Khatjiib came and the bucket turned into a very large
one in his hands. I had never seen any one so strong doing this task,
all the people drank their fill and watered their camels that knelt
down there.
This hadith points to the caliphate of the two shaykhs (Abu Bakr and
'Umar -may Allah be pleased with them); it also refers to 'Umar,
his era and the great conquests that would take place during his time.
This Prophetic dream is a clear example of what would happen to
Ahu Bakr and 'Umar (may AUah be pleased with them) during their
caliphates and points to their good ways and the great impact they
would have, and how the people would benefit from both of them.
All of that came about as the result of their being influenced by the
Prophet @J; he is the one who set the whole thing in motion and he
did a
job when he established the foundation of this religion
and explained its principles and major and minor issues. The people
had entered the religion of Allah in crowds, then Allah (&) revealed
the words:

Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion...)
(Qur 'an 5: 3)

When the Prophet @) passed away, Abu Bakr (&)
succeeded him as leader of the -ah
for two years and a few
months. This is what is referred to by the words, "me] drew a bucket
or two". The narrator was uncertain, but what was meant was two
buckets, as is clearly stated in another report?' During his caliphate
wars were fought against the apostates and their movement was
utterly finished off. At the time of 'Umar, Islam spread further during
his time, many rulings of Islam were enacted as never before, h e
reason being that his caliphate was lengthy and Islam reached many
lands and much wealth was acquired through booty and other means.
This hadith also points to the legitimacy of 'Umar's caliphate and
describes its characteristics and how the Muslim would benefit from
it?'

It was narrated that Hudhayfah said: <(Wewere sitting with the
Messenger of Allah @) and he said, "I do not know how long I have
left among you, so follow the two who come after me" - and he
pointed to Abu Bakr and 'Umar - "and adhere to the guidance of
'M,
and whatever Ibn Mas'ood tells you, believe it.">>30This
hadith clearly points to the legitimacy of 'Umar's caliphate because
the Prophet &)said, "follow the two who come after me", meaning
the two caliphs who would come after him, Abu Bakr and 'Umar.

Abu Bakr S appointment of 'Umar as hir successor

The Prophet's command to obey them is indicative of his praise for
them. Because they were qualified to be obeyed and heeded in
whatever they commanded and forbade, which is indicative of the
goodness of their conduct and sincerity of their hearts, and was a hint
that they would be caliphs after he was gone. The reason why he
encouraged the Muslims to follow the early generations was their
good nature and attitude. Hence they were the best of people after the
Prophets and the best of people after them were those who followed
them in tmth; this will remain so until the Day of ~ud~ernent.~'

a)

The Messenger of Allah
said: cc'Whilst I was sleeping I
saw a vessel being brought to me in which there was milk. I drank
from it until I could see its moisture coming out of my fingers. Then I
gave my leiavers to 'Umar ibn al-KhaMb." They said, "How did

This hadith points to the legitimacy of 'Umar's caliphate. What is
meant by knowledge here is knowledge of how to rule people
according to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of
AUah &). 'Umar is singled out in this manner because of the length
of his caliphate compared to that of Abu Bakr, and because of how
the people agreed to obey him compared with the case of 'Uthmh.
Abu Bakr's caliphate was short, during which there were not many
conquests which were among the greatest causes of dispute. Despite
the length of his caliphate, 'Umar ruled the people in such a way that
no one disputed with him. Then the conquests expanded during the
caliphate of 'Utbmb, and different opinions and thoughts appeared,

and he did not enjoy the same consensus among the people to obey
him that 'Umar had enjoyed. From this stemmed the tribulations
which ultimately ended in his murder. He was succeeded by 'Ali and
the dissent and tribulations only grew worse. So this hadith clearly
points to the legitimacy of 'Umar's ~ a l i ~ h a t e . 3 ~

It was narrated ftom Abu Bakr that: ({The Prophet (&) said
one day, "Who among you has seen a dream?" A man said, "I saw as
if a balance came down ftom heaven and you and Abu Bakr were

Abu Bakr were weighed and Abu Bakr weighed more. 'Umar and

This hadith describes the three in order of virtue. The best of them is
Abu Bakr, followed by 'Umar, followed by 'Uthmh (may Allah be

'Umar's caliphate and indicates that he would become caliph after
Abu Bakr (&). The reason why the Messenger of Allah @) looked
unhappy was because he h e w that the removal of the balance was a

Prophet @) said, "Interpret it." He said, "As for the cloud, it is
Islam. The dripping honey and butter are the Qur'an and its
sweetness, and there are some who take a great deal of the Qur'an
and some who take a little. The rope stretching from heaven to earth

This hadith indicates that 'Umar was entitled to the caliphate and that

-8Another indication of the legitimacy of 'Umar's caliphate is
the fact that the Sahribah were unanimously agreed that they would
not nominate anyone but the best among them. This may be
reinforced by what Abu Bakr and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with
them both) said concerning him. Abu Bakr (&) said: "0' Allah, I

The a h i d e e t h that we have mentioned here clearly indicate that
'Umar (&) was entitled to the caliphate.42
As-SafXreeni (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "It should be
noted that the caliphate of 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, the Commander of
the Faithful (&), is connected to the legitimacy of Abu Bakr's
caliphate. The consensus of the ummah and the indications of the
Qw'an and Sunnah indicate that his caliphate was well-founded. So
whatever is accepted for the trunk (Abu Bakr) is also applicable to the
branch ('Umar), and there is no room to cast aspersions or to dispute
who is more entitled to the caliphate. The scholars knew definitively
that the Sahibah were unanimous in appointing Abu Bakr as caliph.
If any one dissented, this odd view does not undermine the fact that
there was undoubtedly consen~us."~~

1.3. Consensus concerning the appointment
of 'Umar is well established
A number of reliable scholars narrated that there was
consensus among the Sahibah and those who followed them
concerning the caliphate of 'Umar, including the following:

isnad going back to 'Ahdullih ibn 'Abhh (&) that he said: 'I came

close to 'Umar when he had been stabbed, and said, "Receive the
glad tidings of Paradise, 0' Commander of the Faithful. You became
Muslim when the people were still disbelievers, and you strove in
jihad with the Messenger of Allah &) when the people opposed
him, and the Messenger of Allah @) died when he was pleased with
you, and no two people disputed concerning your caliphate, and you
have been !died as a martyr." He said, "Say it again." So I said it
again, and he said, "By Allah, besides Whom there is no other god, if
I bad in my possession all the gold and silver on earth, I would have
paid it to ransom myself from the terror of the Day of ~ n d ~ e m e n t . " ~ ~

Abu Na'eem al-A~bahinisaid, explaining the consensus on
the caliphate of 'Umar: "Because of what Abu Bakr knew of rbe
virtue and sincerity of 'Umar (&), and his ability to do whatever
task he asked him to do, and the help and advice that be had given
him at different times, because Abu Bakr was sincere towards AUah
and the Muslim, he would not have appointed anyone else to this
position. Because Abu Bakr knew full well that the Sahribah
recognized in 'Umar the sincerity and ability that he recognized, and
that they knew him very well and there was no confusion concerning
him, he gave this option (the appointment of 'Umar) to the Muslims
and they accepted it. If they bad had any doubts concerning him they
would have opposed him and they would not have followed him and
obeyed him as they did Abu Bakr (&). So his caliphate was well
founded, as was that of Abu Bakr, and Abu Bakr acted as an advisor
to them, pointing out the best and most perfect, so they accepted that
advice from him and followed it.45

And by means of his leadership, Allah caused His religion to

"They unanimously agreed to Abu Bakr's choice and to implement

From the reports mentioned above, it is clear that 'Umar was
appointed caliph by the unanimous agreement of the Companions of

'Umar as caliph and no one objected to that. This is the unanimous
view of the saved group ofAhl as-Sunnah wa al-Jamci 'ah, who agree

on that which the Companions of the Messenger of Allah
No one differed ftom that except those whose opinion carries no
weight, of those groups who beah grudges against some of the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah @), such as the Rzfidi
Shi'ah and those who followed them in this issue. Some may object
to the consensus of the Sahcibah mentioned above because of the
according to which some of the
report of Ibn Sa'd and others
Sahcibah heard that 'Abdur-Ralp&n ibn 'Awf and 'Uthmk entered
the place of Abu Bakr and one of them said: "What will you say to
your Lord when He asks you why you appointed 'Umar as caliph
over us, when you have seen how harsh he is?" Abu Bakr said: "Sit
me up. Are you telling me to have fear of AUah? He is doomed who
gains nothing ftom indulging in your affairs but wrongdoing. I shall
say, '0' Allah, I appointed over them as caliph the best of Your
people. Tell those who are out there what I have said to you.'
The
answer to this objection -if this report is saheeh is that they said
this not because they were unaware of 'Umar's superiority and his
fitness to rule as the successor to Abn Bakr, but because they were
concerned about his harshness. They were not making any
accusations against h i with regard to his ability and ~incerity.~'

1.4. The speech given by 'Umar
when he became caliph
Reports vary as to the first speech given by 'Umar. Some of
them said that he ascended the minbar and said: "0'Allah, I am
harsh so make me softer; I am weak so make me strong; I am stingy
so make me generous."52
And it was narrated that the first speech he gave was: "Allah is testing
you with me and testing me with you after my two companions. By
Allah, I will not delegate to anyone else any of yow affairs that I can
deal with directly, and if there is anything that I cannot deal with
directly, I will try to delegate it to people who are able to deal with it
and are trustworthy. By Allah, if they (governors) do well, I will
reward them, and if they do badly, I will punish them." Those who
heard his speech and narrated it said: "By Allah, that was bis way

And it was narrated that when he became caliph, he ascended the
minbar and wanted to sit at the same level as Abu Bakr had sat, then
he said: "I would not like AUah to see me putting myselfon the same
level as Abu Bakr." So he went down one step, then he praised Allah,
then he said: "Read Qw'an and you will be recognized for it; act
upon it and you will be among its people; bring yourselves to account
before you are brought to account; prepare yourselves for the great
parade on the Day when you will be brought to judgement before
Allah and not a secret of you will be hidden (cf: Qur 'an 69; 18). No
one who is in a position to be obeyed should be obeyed in anythimg
that involves disobedience towards Allah. With regard to the wealth

a means of being independent I will refrain kom taking anything but
if I need to, I will take on a reasonable basis."54
We can reconcile between these reports if we assume that
'Umar delivered his speech in front of a number of people, some of
whom remembered and reported some parts and others remembered
and narrated other parts. There is nothing strange about Umar's
mixing political and administrative statements with religious
exhortation in the first part of his speech, because that was the
method of the early Imams who did not see any difference between
fearing Allah and enjoining others to do likewise, and running the
affairs of people in accordance with Allah's laws. There is also
nothiig strange about 'Umar showing respect to his predecessor Abu
Bakr and not sitting in the same place as he used to sit, thus making
himself equal with him in the people's eyes. 'Umar thought to
himself and came down one degree from the place where Abu Bakr
used to sit.55
According to another report, two days after 'Umar was
appointed as caliph, the people started talking and saying how
worried they were about his harshness and punishments, so 'Umar
realized that he had to clarify the matter himself. He ascended the
minbar and addressed them, describing how the Prophet @) and
Abu Balcr had been and what their method of dealing with people
was, and how they had been pleased with 'Umar when they died.
Then he said:

wrongdoers and oppressors. I will not allow anyone to oppress
anyone else or to transgress the rights of others, but I will put his
cheek on the ground and place my foot on his other cheek, until he
submits to the truth. In contrast to that former harshness of mine, I
will lay my own cheek on the ground before those who are humble
and modest. 0' people, I make some promises to you, which I will
mention so that you will hold me to them. I promise that I will not
take anything of your taxes or of the booty (fay 3 that Allah grants to

take, I will not spend it except in the proper manner. I promise you
that I will increase your stipends, if Allah wills, and I will protect

places or keep you away from your families for a long time to guard
the borders; when yon axe away on military campaigns, I will be
responsible for your children until you come back to them. Fear

from me and by enjoining what is good and what is evil and by giving
me sincere advice with regard to the way I am running your affairs. I
say these words of mine and I ask Allah to forgive me and you."56
According to another report: "The likeness of the Arabs is that
of an amenable yet proud camel following its driver, so let its driver
watch where he is leading it. By the Lord of the Ka'bah, I will direct
you to follow the (right) path."57
From these reports of what 'Umax said in his speech when he became
caliph, we can see clearly the method that he followed in his rule,
from which he never deviated. The most important points of that
method are as follows:

He regarded his caliphate as a trial with which he was being
tested and for which he would be brought to account as to whether he
had done his duty properly. According to the Rightly-Guided Caliphs
(may Allah be pleased with them), rulership was a responsibility, an
obligation and a trial. It was not the matter of status, honow and
superiority.

This appointment required him to deal directly with matters of
state in matters that he could handle himself, and to appoint over the
people in other regions the best and most qualified of leaders. But in 'Umar's view - that was not enough to absolve him of
responsibility before Allah. Rather he believed that watching over
these governors was an inescapable duty; he rewarded those of them
who did well and punished those who did badly?' We will discuss
this more fully below, when we look at the institution of
governorship and the role that 'Umar played in its development.

The harshness which the people feared on 'Umar's part would
turn into softness and mercy. He was going to set up the balance of
justice, so that those who transgressed and wronged others would
find nothing but humiliation and punishment: "I will not allow

religiously committed and humble would find unsurpassed mercy: "I

will lay my own cheek on the ground before those who are humble
and modest."59
We will see clearly how just 'Umar (&) was towards the
people when we look at different incidents and his concern with the
judiciary system and how he developed it until justice prevailed in all
the provinces of the Islamic state.

The caliph took on the responsibility of defending the ummah
and its religion, and of defending the borders and warding off danger,
hut that was not going to be achieved by being unjust towards the
fighters, therefore he was not going to keep them at the borders until
they couldno longer take it. When they were away with the army,the
caliph and his admmistration would take care of their children and
fa mi lie^.^' 'Umar developed the military institutions and the Islamic
state became a "superpower" that was unrivalled in the world at that
time.

The caliph promised to pay the people all their dues in full
from taxes and booty. He would not ask for any of it or spend any of it
inappropriately. Rather he was going to give them more and increase
their stipends as long as jihad and military campaigns continued. He
urged the people to work hard and controlled the financial situation
of the state6', regulating the income of the treasury (bayt a l - m i l ) and
the way in which money was spent.

In return for all that, he expected the people to do their duty of
being sincere towards the caliph, listening to him and obeying him,
enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil. This encouraged
transparency and accountability in the Islamic society.

He drew attention to the fact that this could not be achieved
except by fearing Allah, checking oneself and being aware that one
would be brought to account in the u ere after.^'

Shaykh 'Ahdul-Wahhib an-Najjiir commented on 'Umar's
words, "The likeness of the Arabs is that of an amenable yet proud
camel..." by saying: "The amenable camel is that which is easygoing,
hut does not llke to be yelled at or beaten. It gives willingly and waks
smoothly and easily. This is an apt description of the Muslim ummah
at his time, because they used to listen and obey, when they were
commanded to do something they would follow that command and
when they were forbidden to do somethmg they would heed that
prohibition. As a result of that, the leader bore a great deal of
responsibility: he had to run the ummah's affairs with wisdom and be
careful in the way in which he took decisions, so that he would not
lead the ummah down dangerous paths or expose it to risk, or neglect
its affairs. What he meant by the (right) path was the straight path in
which there is no crookedness. And he indeed fulfilled that which he
swore he would do.63

178

Abu Bakr 5. appoiniinent of 'Umar as his successor

With regard to harshness and gentleness, Allah has decreed
that people will keep away from a harsh person even if he is sincere
and desires good for them and cares about them.MThis is indicated in
the verse in which Allah ( B )says:
@Andby the Mercy of Allah, you dealt with them gently. And had
you been severe and harsh-hearted, they would have broken away
from about you; so pass over [their faults], and ask [Allah's]
forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs.)
(Qur'an 3: 159)

Hence when 'Umar was appointed caliph, his d u '6'was: "0'Allah, I
am harsh so make me lenient." Allah answered this d u '6' and filled
'Umar's heart with compassion, mercy and kindness, which became
his characteristics after he became caliph. During the time of the
Messenger &) and Abu Bakr, the people knew him as strict and
harsh, and history depicts him as the only one, fiom the time he
entered Islam until he became caliph, who played the role of
toughness and strength alongside the Messenger @) and Abu Bakr,
until he became the ruler, whereupon his character changed and he
became merciful, easygoing and compassionate.65

The public bay'ah at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs
was restricted to the people of Madeenah only. Some of the Bedouins
and tribes who lived around Madeenah or who were visiting the city
may have been present and sworn the oath of allegiance. As for the

rest of the regions, they were hound to follow whatever was decided
in the City of the Prophet &). This did not &ect the bay 'ah or make
it any less legitimate; it would have been impossible to take the oath
of allegiance &om every single Muslim in the regions, and the state
needed a caliph to run its affairs. Moreover the other Muslim regions
gave their approval to what happened in Madeenah with regard to the
appointment of Abu Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthmh, whether explicitly or
implicitly. No doubt the methods used by the people in the earliest
Islamc times reflect the fact that the state and its institutions were
still developing.66

Women and the oath of allegiance:
During my research I could not find any indication that women
gave their oath of allegiance at the time of Abu Bakr and 'Umar and
at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. The ancient books on
shari'ah-based politics do not refer to women's right to give the oath
of allegiance or describe it as their duty -as far as I know. It seems
that during most eras of Islamic history, bay 'ah was restricted to the
men only, in exclusion of women. Men did not call on women to be
involved, and women did not demand that. Women's absence kom
the process of bay'ah was regarded as something natural, to the
extent that the scholars who discussed Islamic constitutional rights
did not mention women at all. But these historical and fiqhi facts do
not alter the shar 'i ruling. There is nothing in the Qur'an or Sunnah
-which are the main sources of shari'ah -to suggest that women
should not play a role in the bay'ah process alongside men.67

Returning Arab female prisoners of war:
The first decision that 'Umar took as ruler was the decision to
return the female prisoners captured kom the apostates to their tribes.
He said: "I would not like the taking of female prisoners to become a
custom among the ~ r a b s . " ~ '
This courageous step made the Arabs feel that they were all
equal before the law of Allah, and that no tribe was superior to
another, except in terms of how much they strove for the sake of
Allah and the services that they offered to Islam and the Muslims. He
followed this step with another, namely allowing those former
apostates who had repented openly to play a role in the wars against
the enemies of Islam. They proved their courage in war and were
steadfast in combat, and they demonstrated unmatched loyalty to the
state.69

The caliphate bad become deeply rooted in the hearts of the
ummah and become a symbol of Muslim unity and strength. The
researcher can see the high capability that the noble Sahribah
enjoyed, and the extent of the originality of their work when he
realizes that what they established mthin a few short hours on the
same day that the Messenger &) died, it took the British
conspirators a quarter of a century to destroy, even though the British
themselves used to call the caliphate the "sick old man" at that time.

many centuries.70

The difference between a king and a caliph:
'Urnar said: "By Allah, 1do not know if I am a caliph or a king.
If I am a king this is a serious matter." Someone said to him: "There
is a difference between them. A caliph does not take anything except
rightfully, and he does not give anything except rightfully, and you
-praise be to Allah - are like that. A king oppresses the people,
taking from one and giving to another." And 'Umar fell silent.71

According to another report, 'Umar asked S a h i b al-Fiirisi:
"Am I a king or a caliph?" Salmk said: "If you collect from the land
a dirham,or less or more, and put it where it does not belong, then
you are a king and not a caliph." And 'Umar wept7'

1.5. Shoora

"Men are of three types: a man who deals with problems according to
his own opinion; a man who consults others with regard to matters he
is confused about and follows the opinion of those who have
wisdom; and a man who is confused and helpless, as he does not
consult others and cannot take decisions."77
"It is the duty of the Muslims to m their affairs by consultation
between them and people of wisdom, as the people should follow
those who are in charge of their affairs. So long as they are united
then their opinion becomes binding on the people and the people
should follow them. Whoever becomes in charge of the Muslims'
affairs should follow the opinion of the people of wisdom and
whatever they suggest is in the best interests of the Muslims, and
whatever plans they draw up in the case of war, the people should
follow their opinion."78
'Umar used to urge his military commanders to engage in
shoora (mutual consultation). When he sent Abu 'Ubayd ath-Thaqafi
to fight the Persians in Iraq, he said to hnn:"Listen to and obey the
and let them have a say, especially

And he wrote to Sa'd ibn Abi WaqqQ (saying): "You should
have some among the Arabs of whose sincerity you are certain,
because you will not benefit from what a liar tells you, even if he
occasionally tells the truth. The traitor is spying against you, not for
you."81

he is experienced in warfare and in drawing up plans to defeat the

The way in which 'Umar put shoora into practice was good.
He used to consult the common people first and listen to them, then
he would gather the elder Companions of the Messenger of AUah
&)and the people of wisdom among them, tell them about the issue
and ask them to reach a good conclusion, and whatever they agreed
upon, he would cany it out. His actions in this case are similar to
those of constitutional regimes in many kingdoms where issues are
first discussed in the parliament, for example, then after bemg agreed
upon by the majority, they are referred to a higher council which may
be called "senators" or "lords", and once that council has reached its
decision, the king executes a decree. The difference between what
'Umar did and what these kingdoms do is that in 'Umar's case it was
based on his own ijtihad, without there being any system or laws in
place.85 On many occasions, 'Umar examined an issue, thought
about it and expressed his view, then the weakest of people would

come and explain the correct view, offering evidence for that, and
'Umar would retract his mistaken view and accept the correct view
once he became convinced of it.86
The issues that required shoora became numerous during
'Umar's mle because many new issues arose as Islam spread and
reached lands with civilizations, traditions and different systems.
New problems were created which required comprehensive ijtihad,
such as how to deal with conquered lands, how to regulate stipends
according to new principles, how war booty collected by the state
was to be spent. 'Umar used to assemble the largest number of senior
Sahdbah he could for shooras7, and the shaykhs of Badr enjoyed a
special status with regard to shoora because of their virtue,
knowledge and superiority.
But 'Umar started to add younger people to the gatherings too,
because he h e w that the elders were approaching the end of their
lives and would soon go to their Lord and His mercy and forgiveness,
and the state needed to renew its manpower. The brilliant 'Umar
realized this fact and started to choose from among the youth of the
ummah those whom he sensed were knowledgeable and pions.
'Abdulla ibn 'AbbG was one of the first of them, and 'Umar
continued to choose some of the youth of the ummah as advisors
based on how much they h e w of the Qur'an. 'Abdulla ibn 'Abbis
said: "Those who were well-versed in Qur'an were the members of
'Umar's council and his advisors, whether they were old or
young."88
Az-Zubri said to some young people: "Do not think too little

was faced with a difficult problem, he would call the young people
and seek their advice, relying on the sharpness of their minds.89
Muhumad ibn Sireen said: 'Umar used to consult people
about matters and he would even consult the women, and if he saw
something in a woman's opinion that he thought was good, he would
follow it. It is narrated that on one occasion he consulted the Mother
of the Believers Hafsah (s).~'
'Umar also had an inner circle from among the Sahribah and
people of wisdom and understanding, including al-'Abbik ibn
'Abdul-Mumlib and his son 'Abdullih -who was with him almost
constantly, whether he was travelling or not - and 'Uthntk ibn
',
'Abdur-Ribn 'Awf, 'Ali ibn Abi plib9', MuL%&ibn
Jabal, Ubayy ibn Ka'b, Zayd ibn Tbibip2, and others of their caliber
whom he used to consult and seek their advice.93These advisors used
to express their views with full kedom and f k h e s s . 'Umar never
accused any of them with regard to his character and honesty. 'Umar
used to consult them with regard to matters concerning which there
was no clear text in the Qur'an and Sumah, aiming to find out
whether one of the Sahdbah knew something from the Suanah
concerning it, for some of the Sahribah might have known things that
others did not. Similarly he used to seek advice in understanding
those texts which might cany more than one meaning, in order to
become familiar with all the possible meanings. With regard to these
situations (concerning which there was no text), he would sometimes
be content to seek the advice of one person or of a few people.

With regard to calamities, he would assemble the Sahribah and
widen the circle of advisors as much as possible, as he did when the
plague struck Syria when he was on his way there." News of that
reached 'Umar when the governors came to meet him in Saragh,
which is a place near Syria. The Muhdjireen and An+& were with
'Umar, so he assembled them and asked them whether he should
canyon or go back. They differed concerning that. Some said, "You
came out seeking the pleasure of Allah and this should not stop you
h m canying on." Others said: "It is a trial and death, and we do not
think that you should go and meet it." Then he summoned the
Muhejireen of Quraysh, and they did not differ concerning the
matter, ratherthey advised him to go back. So 'Umar called out to the
people: "In the morning we will head back." Abu 'Ubaydah said:
"Are you running away h m the decree ofAllah?" He said: "Yes. We
are running away from the decree ofAllah to another decree. Do you
think that if you have camels and you go to a valley in which there are
two areas, one which is green and one which is arid,if you gaze your
camels in the green area that is by the decree of Allah, and if you
graze them in the arid area that is also by the decree of Allah?"
'Abdur-Raljmfin ibn 'Awf heard them and came to them and said:

The areas of shoora at the time of 'Umar were many and
varied, such as the administrative aad political fields, such as the
selection of agents and governors, military matters, purely shar'i
issues, such as determining sharY rulings on whether things were
hala or harrim, and matters pertaining to courts and the passing of

judgements.96 We will discuss the various fields in whichshoora was
applied, and 'Umar's efforts to h d the strongest evidence, in the
appropriate places in this book, in sha' Allih. What we would like to
emphasize is that the caliphate of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs was
based on the principle of shoora which is derived from the Qur'an
and Sunnah. The reign of 'Umar was not an isolated case which was
something invented solely by hm, rather it was one of the principles
of the divine system of Islam.

1.6. Justice and equality
One of the aims of Islamic rule is to set out the principles of the
Islamic system for the purpose of establishing an Islamic society.
Among the most important of these principles are justice and
equality. In the speeches which 'Umar gave to the ummah,he
afkmed these principles, and his justice and sense of equality were
manifested in the speech which he delivered to the ummah on the day
when he became caliph. Undoubtedly justice, in 'Umar's mind,
meant the justice of Islam, which is the main pillar of Islamic society
and Islamic rule. Islam cannot exist in a society where injustice
prevails and justice is unknown.
The establishment ofjustice between people on the individual,
social and international levels is not a voluntary matter that depends
on the moods or whims and desires of a ruler. Rather the
establishment of justice between people is regarded as one of the
most sacred and important of duties in Islam. The ummah is
unanimously agreed that justice is obligatory.g7 Al-Fakhr ar-Rizi

'Umar ibn al-KhaGb

189

"They (the scholars) are unanimously agreed that whoever is a ruler
(or judge) must rule (or judge) with justice."98
This ruling is supported by the texts of the Qur'an and Sunnah.
One of the goals of the Islamic state is to establish an Islamic state in
which justice and equality prevail and injustice is eliminated and
opposed in all its forms. The state should provide opportunities for
each person who is seeking his rights to attain them in the quickest
and easiest manner possible without that costing him any effort or
money. The state should prevent all means that put obstacles in the
way of the one who is seeking ,his rights. This is what 'Umar did in
his state. He opened the doors to enable allpeople to get what is their
due and he himself checked on the people's situation,protecting them
fkom oppression and establishing justice between the governors and
the people, not caring whether the one against whom judgement was
passed was a relative or an enemy, rich or poor. Allah (@) says:
$0' you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allah as just witnesses;
and let not the enmity and hatred of o t h a make you avoid justice. Be
just: that is nearer to piety; and fear Allah. Verily, Allah is WellAcquainted with what you do.)
(Qur'an 5: 8)
'Umar's example of justice captured hearts and minds. In his
view, justice was a practical way of calling people to Islam and
opening people's hearts to faith. He followed the same method as the
Prophet @), a way which was based on justice that encompassed all
people. His success on the practical level is unprecedented, so much
so that his name became synonymous with justice and anyone who
leams even a little about his life story can hardly separate the two.
There are a number of factors that contributed to this great success,
including the following:

190

Abu Bakr 5. appointment of V m a r as his successor

-1His caliphate lasted longer than that of Abu Bala. 'Umar's
caliphate lasted for ten years whereas Abu Bakr's lasted only two
years and a few months.

He adhered firmly to the truth, to such an extent that he was
stricter with himself and his own f d y than with the people, as we
shall see.

The concept of meeting Allah was deeply rooted in his mind,
to such an extent that in all that he did, he sought the pleasure of
Allah before the pleasure of the people, and he feared AUah but he
did not fear anyone among the people.

The authority of shari'ah held sway in the hearts of the

Sahdbah and Tdbi'een, so that 'Urn's actions met with strong
support and a great deal of cooperation &om everyone.99

He ruled in favour of a Jewish man against a Muslim; the fact
that the Jew was a M f i r did not cause him to be unjust towards him or
to be biased against him. Imam ~ i l i knarrated
' ~ ~ from Sa'eed ibn alMusayyib that a Jew and a Muslim referred their dispute to 'Umar ibn

'Umar saw that the Jew was in the right and he
ruled in his favour. The Jew said to him: "By Allah you have ruled
aright."l0'
'Umar (&) used to command his agents to come and meet
him on certain occasions, and when they had gathered he would say:
"0' people, I do not send my agents to you to beat you or to take your
money, rather I send them to protect you against any injustice and to
divide the war booty among you. If anyone has had anything else
done to him, let him stand up." No one stood up except one man who
stood up and said, "0' Commander of the Faithfd, your agent gave
me one hundred lashes." He asked, "What did you beat him for? Get
up and settle the score." 'Amr ibn al-'AS stood up and said, "0'
Commander of the Faithful, if you do that, things will go out of
control and it will set a precedent that people will follow after you."
He asked, "Should I not establish justice when the Messenger of
Allah allowed people to settle scores with him?" He said: "Then let
us make a deal with him." He said: "Here he is, work it out with
him." So they compensated him by giving him two hundred dinrirs,
two dincirs for each blow of the whip.'OZ If they had not made this
deal, 'Umar would have allowed the man to settle the score.

the just state to prevail even if it is a Efir state, and He does not allow
an unjust state to prevail, even if it is Muslim... and by means of
justice the best in men is brought out and wealth inc~eases."'~~
The principle of equality was also established by 'Umar in his
state. It is regarded as one of the basic principles that are a w e d by
Islam. Allah (&) says:
$0'mankind! We have created you from a male and a female, and
made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another.
Verily, the most honourable of you with Allah is that [believer] who
has at-Taqwa [i.e. he is one of the Muttaqoon [the pious105].Verily,

(Qnr'an 49: 13)

In the Islamic view, all people are equal, rulers and subjects,
men and women, Arabs and non-Arabs, white and black. Islam has
abolished all differences among people based on race, colour, lineage
and class. Rulers and subjects are all equal according to shari'ah.lo6
'Umar's implementation of this principle offers the best testimony of
that. There follow some stories which highlight the principle of
equality in his state.
During 'Umar's reign a famine struck Madeenah and its
environs. When the wind blew, sand would come down !?om the sky
ar-Ramidah
like asheslo7, hence that year became known as 'h
(the Year of Ashes). 'Umar swore that he would not eat ghee, yogurt
or milk until all the people could afford to have these things. Then
some ghee and yogurt reached the marketplace and a slave bought
them for 'Umar for forty (dirhams). He came to 'Umar and said: "0'
Commander of the Faithful, AUah has fulfilled your oath and made
your reward great. Some ghee and yogurt came to the marketplace
and I bought them for you for forty (dirhams)." 'Umar said, "You
paid too much for them. Give them in charity, for I do not like to eat
in an extravagant manner." And 'Umar said, "How can I be
concerned for the people if I do not snffer what they snffer?"lo8 This
was 'Umar's attitude during the year of famine which was known as
the Year of Ashes, and his attitude did not change wben things
became expensive. When the price of ghee grew high, 'Umar ate
olive oil and his stomach rumbled. He said: "Rumble as much as you
like, for by Allah you will not eat ghee until the people eat it."lo9

In the view of the early caliphs, the principle of equality was
not limited only to dealing with people in the same way, rather it also
extended to specific social matters such as the relationship between
servant and master. It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbh said: 'Umar ibn
al-KhaGb came for Hajj, and Safwin ibn Umayyah made food for
him. They brought a vessel that was carried by four men. The food
was placed before the people for them to eat, and the servants
remained standing. 'Umar said: "Don't you want them to eat with
you?" Sufiyin ibn 'Abdulliih said: 'Wo, by Allah, 0' Commander of
the Faithful. We want to keep this food for ourselves." 'Umar
became very angy and said: "Who are these people who give
themselves precedence over their servants? May Allah punish
them!" Then he said to the servants: "Sit down and eat." So the
servants sat down and ate, and 'Umar did not eat.'''
Similarly, 'Umar would not eat of food that was not available
to all the Muslim, and he used to fast all the time. At the time of the
famine, when evening came he would eat bread that had been soaked
in oil, until one day some people slaughtered a camel."' They gave
its meat to the people, and they took the best parts of it -the hump
and the liver -and brought that to him. He said: "Where did you get
this?" They said, "0' Commander of the Faithful, it is from a camel
that we slaughtered today." He said, "Oh no, oh no, what a bad ruler I
am if I eat from the best of it and the people eat from the worst of i t
Take this away and bring some other food." Some bread and olive oil
were brought to him, and he started breaking the bread with his own
hands and soaking it in the oil.''z

'Umar did not apply this principle of equality in Madeenah
only, rather he taught it to his agents and governors in other regions,
even with regard to matters of food and drink.'13 When 'Uthah ihn
Farqad went to Azerbaijan, some khabeq was brought to him and
when he ate it, he found that it was sweet and good. He said: "By
Allah, I will make something like that for the Commander of the
Faithful." So he made two huge trays of it for him and sent them on a
camel, accompanied by two men, to 'Umar. When they came to
'Umar he opened them and asked: "What is this?" They said,
''Khabee~."He tasted it and found it was sweet. He said: "Can all the
Muslims afford to have this in their homes?" He said: "No." He said:
"Then take it back." Then he wrote to him, saying: "It is not by the
efforts of your father or mother (that you are living this life). Make
sure that the Muslims are eating the same kind of food as you have in
your own home.""4
Another way in which 'Umar put the principle of equality into
practice was when some wealth came to him and he started sharing it
out among the people, and they crowded around him. Sa'd ibn Ahi
Waqqig came, pushing and shoving until he reached 'Umar, who
sback him with a stick and said: 'You have come showing no respect
to the authority of Allah on earth (i.e., the caliph), and I would like to
teach you that the authority of Allah has no respect for you."115 Ifwe
remember that Sa'd was one of the ten who were given glad tidings of
Paradise and that he was the conqueror of Iraq and the capital of
Chosroes, and one of the six who were appointed by 'Umar for
shoora (when he was stabbed), and that the Messenger of Allah @)
died when he was pleased with him, and that he was known as the
Knight of Islam, we will realize how committed 'Umar was to

Ibn al-Jawzi narrated that 'Amr ibn d-'AScarried out the
punishment for wine-drinking on ' A b d u r - R w ibu 'Umar ibn alKha@b when he was his governor in Egypt. Such punishments were
usually carried out in the public square of the city, so as to teach a
lesson to the masses, but 'Amr carried out the punishment on the son
of the caliph in his house. When news of that reached 'Umar, he
wrote to 'Amr ibn d-'ASsaying: "From the slave of Allah 'Umar the
Commander of the Faithful to the sinner (al-'&i) Ibu al-'&. I am
amazed at you, 0' son of al-'& and your audacity towards me in
doing something other than what I told you to do. I gave you
precedence over the people of Badr who are better than you, and I
chose you so that you would do what I tell you to do. But you have
betrayed me and sunk to this low level. I think that the only thing I
can do is to dismiss you in the most humiliating manner. You beat
'Abdur-Ralpnin in your house, and you know that this is against my
instructions. ' A b d u r - w is just one of your people, so do with
him what you would do with any other M u s h . But probably you
thought that he is the son of the caliph, when you know that I accept
no compromise for any of the people when it comes to carrying out
the hadd punishments prescribed by Allah. When this letter of mine
reaches you, send him weaxing a cloak on a mount so that he will
realize how had his action was."lI7 He was brought to Madeenah and
the hadd punishment was carried out publicly This was narrated by
Ibn Sa'd and referred to by Ibn az-Zuhayr, and it was narrated by
'Abdur-Razziq in a lengthy report with a saheeh isnad fiom Ibn
mar."* Here we can see equality before shari'ah in the clearest

way. The accused was the son of the caliph, but the governor did not
exempt him from punishment. However 'Umar noticed that his son
enjoyed some special treatment, which upset h i greatly, so he
punished his govemor - the conqueror of Egypt - severely and
camed out on his son the punishment that he deserved, out of
keenness to carry out the hadd punishment prescribed by Allah and
to discipline his son and straighten him out. If this was the way in
which he dealt with the closest ofpeople to him, how do you think he
dealt with others?"9
Another of the historical examples which authors quote as
proof of 'Umar's uncompromising application of the principle of
equality is the story of what 'Umar did with Jabalah ibn al-Ayham.
Jabalah was the last of the leaders of Ghassin who had been
appointed by Heraclius. The tribes of Ghassin lived in Syria under
Byzantine rule, and the Byzantines used to incite them continually to
attack Arabia, especially after the emergence of Islam. When the
Islamic conquests spread and the Muslims won one victory after
another against the Byzantines, the Arab tribes in Syria started to
declare their Islam and the Ghassanid leader decided that he would
enter Islam too. So he became M u s l i and his people became
Muslim with him. He wrote to 'Umar, asking him for permission to
come to Madeenah, and 'Umar rejoiced at his becoming Muslim and
his impending visit. So he came to Madeenah and stayed there for a
while, and 'Umar welcomed him and took care of him.
Then he decided to go for Hajj, and whilst he was
circumambulating the Ka'bah, a man from Banu F a z W stepped on
his izir and it fell off. The Ghassanid leader -who was still new in
Islam - became angry and struck the man harshly, breaking his
nose. The FazSlri man hastened to the caliph to complain to him about

'I9

Fann a/-Huh fee al-Isldm, by Dr. Mustafa Abu Zay4 4.475, 476

198

Abu Bakr k appoinment of 'Umaras his successor

what had happened to him. 'Umar sent for Jabalah and asked him
about the incident, and he coufirmed (what the Faziri man had said).
'Umar said to him: "What made you wrong your brother and break
his nose?" He replied: "You are being too kind to this Bedouin. Were
it not for the sanctity of the House I would have chopped off his
head." 'Umar said: "You have admitted it. Either you will settle the
matter with the man or I will carry out gascis against you." Jabalah
ibn al-Ayham was astounded by what was happening and he said:
"How can this be when he is a commoner and I am a king?"
'Umar said: "Islam has made you equal."
The Ghassanid leader said: "I had thought, 0' Commander of
the Faithful, that I would be in a better position in Islam than I was in
the J6hiliyah."
'Umar said: "Stop arguing. If you do not settle matters with
this man, I will cany out gas@ against you."
Jabalah said: "Then I will become a Christian."
'Umar said: "If you become a Christian I will strike your neck
(cut off your head), because you have become Muslim, and if you
apostatize I will execute you."'Z0
At that point Jabalah realized that that was no point in arguing and
that arguing with 'Umar was to no avail. So he asked h i to give him
time to think about the matter, and 'Umar gave him permission to
leave. Jabalah thought about it and reached a decision which was not
a good one. He preferred to leave Makkah, with his people, under
cover of darkness, and flee to Constantinople, and he arrived there as
a Christian. He later regretted this decision deeply, and mentioned
that in verses of poetry which are still extant.

In this story we see 'Umar's keenness for the principle of equality
IZ0 Ibn Khaldoon, 21281, quoting fiom N i g h a1-Hukm by al-Q%simi, 1190

'Umor ibn al-KhaEBb

199

before shari'ah. Islam had made the king and the commoner equal,
and this equality had to become something that was implemented in
real life and not just words written on a page or an empty slogan
recited on people's lips.121
'Umar (&) put into effect the principle of equality that had
been brought by the shari'ah (Islamic law) of the Lord of the Worlds,
and made it a living reality that was experienced by the people. That
was not affected by paternal bonds, noble titles or differences in
religion, nor did he try to appease conquering warriors. This great
principle became a living reality that was felt by rulers and subjects
alike, and those who were wronged and oppressed benefited fiom
it."' The application of the principle of equality had an effect on
society at the time of the four caliphs, which was manifested in the
souls of that generation, who shunned traditional hibalism and claims
to superiority and leadership on the basis of lineage. Differences
based on lineage were eliminated, no man of noble birth thought he
could take advantage of a man of lowly birth and no weak man
despaired of claming his rights. All were equal in rights and duties.
The principle of equality in the society at the time of the four caliphs
was a new light which Islam spread throughout the Muslim society
and this principle played a strong role in the formation of that
society.1z3

1.7. Freedom
The principle of fieedom is one of the basic principles on
which the rule of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs was based. This

principle implies the preservation of public freedom for all people
within the limits set out by shari'ah and in such a way that it does not
contradict shari'ah. The Islamic call for the freedom of all people was
a far-reaching call, the like of which is seldom found in history. The
first call that was made in this field was the call made in many verses,
inviting people to a m the Oneness of Allah and to devote their
worship to Him alone, to the exclusion of any other beings or
creatures. This call to Tawheed encompasses all the meanings of
freedom and independence for m a n h d . Sometimes it is manifested
in positive actions, such as enjoining what is good and forbidding
what is evil, and sometimes it is manifested in negative actions, such
as refi-aining from forcing people to enter Islam. In many cases this
meaning is combined with those of mercy, justice, shoora and
equality, because none of these principles which are advocated by
Islam can be established and be implemented except by means of
freedom.
At the time of the Rightly Guided Caliphs in particular, the
principle of £reedom effectively contributed to the spread of Islam,
making it easy for the Muslims to conquer other lands and expand the
boundaries of their state, because Islam honoured man and
guaranteed his fteedom in the broadest sense. In contrast, the other
political systems that were prevalent at that time, in the Byzantine
and Persian states, were oppressive totalitarian regimes under which
the people, especially political opponents and reliaous minorities,
suffered the worst type of persecution and oppression. For example,
the Byzantine state tried to force those who followed the Jacobite
teachings, especially in Egypt and Syria, to follow the Melchite
teachings (the official religion). Dissidents were frequently seized
and burned alive. The tyrantsforced them to believe in what had been
approved by the Macedonian council; otherwise they would be
placed in sacks full of sand and thrown into the depths of the sea.

'Umar ibn al-Khanrib

201

Similarly the Persian state, at various times in its history,
persecuted the followers of divinely-revealed religions, especially
Christians, after fighting between Persia and Byzantium intensified.
But in Islam at the time of the Messenger of Allah &) and the
Rightly-Guided Caliphs, the kind of freedom which-is known
nowadays was known and was protected.'M There follow some
examples of freedom at the time of 'Umar (&).

1.7.1. Freedom of religious belief
Islam does not force anyone to accept it, rather it calls them to
study and ponder the creation of AUah and this religion. And it
commands its followers to debate with people in the way that is
better. Allah (&) says:
(There is no compulsion in religion...8

(Qur'an 2: 256)

4But if they turn away [0' Muhammad from the Islamic
Monotheism, which you have brought to them]. We have not sent
you [O' Muhammad] as a Hafee& [watcher, protector] over them
[i.e. to take care of their deeds and to recompense them]. Your duty is
to convey [the Message]...),
(Qur'an 42: 48)
(Invite [mankind, 0' Muhammad] to the way of your Lord [i.e.
Islam] with wisdom [i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur'an]
and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better. Truly,
your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path, and He is
(Qur'an 16: 125)
the Best Aware of those who are guided.),
(And argue not with the people of the Scripture [Jews and
Christians], unless it be in [a way] that is better [with good words and
in good manner, inviting them to Islamic Monotheism with His

Verses], except with such of them as do wrong; and say [to them],
'We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to
you; our Ilih [God] and your Ilih [God] is One [i.e. Allah], and to
(Qur 'an 29: 46)
Him we have submitted [as Muslims].')
And there are many similar verses. Hence we find that in his
state, 'Umar was keen to protect religious freedom. We may note that
in this matter 'Umar was following the guidance of the Prophet @)
and the first Rightly-Guided Caliph Abn Bakr. He allowed the people
of the Book to practise their religion, he took the jizyah from them
and he drew up treaties with them as will be discussed below. Their
places of worship were not destroyed, rather they were left alone,
because Allah (@) says:

(... For had it not been that Allah checks one set of people by means
of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques,
wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much would surely, have
(Qur'an 22: 40)
been pulled down...),
The conquests which took place at the time of 'Urnar, carried
out by the Sahibah, bear witness to the respect that Islam showed to
other religions and the keemess of the Islamic leadership to avoid
forcing anyone to enter Islam. One day an old Christian woman came
to 'Umar himself concerning some need of hers. He said to her:
"Become Muslim and you will be safe, for Allah sent Muhammad
with the truth." She said, "I am an old woman and death is very close
to me." So he dealt with her need, but he was womed that what he
had done might imply some exploitation of her need in an attempt to
force her to become Muslim. So he prayed to Allah for forgiveness
for what he had done, and said, "0' Allah, I was trying to guide her,
not trying to force her."lz5

'Umar had a Christian slave whose name was Ashaqq. He
said: "I was a Christian slave belonging to 'Umar." He ('Umar) said:
"Become Muslim so that we may benefit from your help with regard
to some of the Muslims' affairs, because we should not seek help in
dealing with their affairsfrom someone who is not one of them." But
I refused, and he said, (There is no compulsion in religion) (Qur ,an 2:
256). When 'Umar was dying, he set me free and said, "Go wherever
you want."126
The People of the Book used to practise their religious rituals
and perform their acts of worship in their places of worship and their
houses, and no one prevented them from doing that, because Islamic
shari'ah gives them the right to hedom of belief. At-Tabari tells us
of the treaty which 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b (&) drew up with the
people of Aeelia' (Jerusalem), in which he stated that he was giving
security to the people of Aeelia' and that their lives, wealth, crosses
and churches would be protected.127
'Umar's governor in Egypt, 'Amr ibn al-'As, drew up a trea!y
with the people of Egypt in which it said: "In the Name of Allah, the
Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is what 'Amr ibn al-'AS
gives to the people of Egypt of security, protecting their lives, their
religion, their wealth, their churches, their crosses, their land and
their sea." He confirmed this treaty by saying: "The one who signs it
is bound before Allah and is under the protection of His Messenger,
the caliph and the belie~ers.""~

not be prevented from doing that unless they do it openly. If they
want to practise their religious rituals openly and in public, such as
bringing out their crosses, then the Muslims think that they should
not be allowed to do that in the Muslim regions, but they should not
be prevented from doing that in their own towns and villages.'3o
Shaykh al-Ghazili says concerning Islam's guarantee of
freedom of belief that the religious freedom which Islam guarantees
to people is something the like ofwhich was not known on any of the
five continents. It never happened that one religion gained all power
and gave other religions all the means of surviving and flourishing, as
Islam did.13'
'Umar was keen to implement the principle of religious
freedom in society and he summed up his policy towards the Jews
and Christians by saying: 'We gave them a treaty stating that we
would leave them alone with regard to their churches, to say
whatever they want in them, and that we would not burden them with
more than they can bear, and that if their enemies want to harm them
we will fight to defend them, and that we will not interfere between
them and their (religions) rulings except if they come to us, asking us
to judge on the basis of our rulings; and that if they keep their affairs
to themselves, we will not bother them."'32
It was proven that 'Umar was very tolerant towards ahl adhdhimmah, to such an extent that he would let them off paying the
jizyah if they were unable to do so. In Kiteb al-Amwcil, Abu 'Ubayd
states that 'Umar passed by the door of some people and saw there an
old blind man who was begging. He tapped him on the shoulder and

said: "From which of the people of the Book are you?" He said: "(I
am) a Jew." He said: "What forced you to do what I see (i.e.,
begging)?" He said: "I am begging because ofthejizyah and needs of
the old age." 'Umar took him by the hand and took him to his house,
where he gave him something from his house. Then he sent for the
keeper of the bayt al-mil and said: "Check him and others like him,
for by Allah we have not been fair to him if we benefited from him
(from his jizyah) when he was young and abandon him when he is
old." And he let him and others like him off from paying the
j i z y ~ h . 'And
~ ~ he wrote to his agents issuing this command to all of
them.134
These actions point to the justice of Islam and 'Umar's
keenness to establish his state on a basis ofjustice and kindness to its
people, even if they were not Muslim. Religious freedom remained a
prominent feature of the era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs,
guaranteed by the state and protected by the rulings of shari'ah.

1.7.2. Freedom of movement
'Umar was very keen to allow this freedom, but he limited it in
some exceptional cases as dictated by need. Those exceptional cases,
in which he limited the freedom of movement and freedom to choose
where one would live, were very few. It is sufficient for us to refer to
two of them because of their importance:

1. 'Umar kept the senior Sahibah in Madeenah and did not allow
them to go to the conquered lands except with his permission or for
some official purpose, such as when he appointed some of them as
his governors or leaders of his annies. He did that so that he would be

206

Abu Bakr b appointment of 'Umar as his successor

able to consult them and refer to them concerning problems that he
came across in ruling. At the same time, this prevented any fitnah
(tribulation) or division arising among the Muslims which might
have happened if the Sahribah had gone out to the other regions and
settled there.135 Based on his political wisdom and his precise
understanding of human nature and psychology, he kept the senior
Sahribah in Madeenah, and said: "What I fear the most for this
nmmah is your spreading out into other lands."136 He believed that if
he was lenient in this matter, that would result in tribulation in the
conquered lands, as the people would rally around the prominent
personalities and there would be a lot of confusion about them. There
would be many leaders and figureheads, and chaos would ensue.13'
'Umar feared the prospect of having multiple centres of political and
religious power within the Islamic state, wherein each Sahribi might
acquire an aura of respect through which his opinion would reach the
level of a decree issued by the public authorities. So in order to
prevent the development of multiple centres of power and the
fragmentation of the state's authority, 'Umar thought that he should
keep the senior Sahibah in Madeenah, where they could take part in
decision-making and avoid the chaos of individual ijtihad. Were it
not for this shar 'i basis, the decisions issued by 'Umar would have
been to no avail and they would not have been binding, because they
would lack any shar 'i basis of justification, because the disposal of
the -ah's
affairs should be connected to its interests.13'

2. The second case arose when 'Umar commanded that the Christians
of N a j h and the Jews of Khaybar be expelled from the Arabian
heartland to Iraq and Syria. The reason for that was that the Jews of

Khaybar and the Christians of N a j A did not adhere to the conditions
of the treaties that they bad agreed with the Messenger of Allah (g)
and renewed with Abu Bakr. The for!xesses of the Jews of Khaybar
and the Christians of Najrin had become centres of plotting and
conspiracy, so 'Umar bad no choice but to remove these devilish
strongholds and weaken their power. The rest of the Jews and
Christians continued to live as individuals in the society of
Madeenah, enjoying all their rights. Al-Bayhaqi narrated in his

Peninsula.")) Maik said that Ibn Shihib said: 'Umar ibn al-Khasb
examined the matter until he found the answer in a report narrated
from the Messenger of Allah @), who said: ((''No two religions
should co-exist in the Arabian Peninsula."), So he expelled the Jews
of Khaybar. Milik said: 'Umar ibn al-KhaRtib (&) expelled the

For the Sahcibah, the Prophethood of the Prophet @$Jwas something
definite. But neither the Jews nor the Christians of N a j A could
adhere to their treaties with the Muslim because of the severity of
their enmity, hatred and envy of Islam and the Muslims. The reason
why the Jews of Khaybar were expelled was narrated by Ibn 'Umar
(&) who said: "When the people of Khaybar attacked 'Abdull2h ibn
'Umar, 'Umar stood up and addressed (the people) and said, 'The
made a deal with the Jews of Khaybar,
Messenger of Allah
allowing them to keep their wealth. He said, 'We leave (this land) to
you so long as Allah wills.' 'Abdull2h ibn 'Umar went out to his
property there and was attacked at night, and his arms and legs were
dislocated. We have no other enemies there; they are our enemies and

we are accusing them, and I am thinking of expelling them.' When
'Umar resolved to do thaf someone £rom Banu al-Haqeeq came to
him and said, '0' Commander of the Faithful, will you expel us when
let us stay and made a deal with us with regard to

the land there, and stipulated conditions for that?' 'Umar said, 'Do
you think that I have forgotten what the Messenger of Allah @) said,
'What about when you are expelled &om Khaybar, riding your strong
camel, night afier night'?' He said, 'That was a joke on the part of
Abu al-Qkim.' He ('Umar) said, 'You are lying, 0' enemy ofAllah.'
So 'Umar expelled them, and gave them the price of the fruits they
had there in money and camels and other goods such as saddles and
ropes and so on.140 The Jews had betrayed and broken the treaty, so it
was natural that they should be expelled fiom the Arabian Peninsula,
in fulfillment of the instrnctions of the Messenger of Allah &). So
'Umar expelled them to Tayma' and Jericho.

As for the Christians of Najrgn, they did not adhere to the
terms of their treaty which they had agreed with the Messenger of
and renewed with Abu Bakr. They broke some of those
Allah
terms and consumed riba and dealt in it, so 'Umar expelled them
fiom Najrin to Iraq and wrote to them, saying: "If any of these people
come to the governors of Syria or Iraq, let him give them barren land.
Whatever they produce is theirs for the sake of Allah, and is the
produce of their land." So they came to Iraq and settled in alNajAiyah, which is a village near ~ o o f a h . ' ~Abu

'Umar's insight in directing these heavy blows against the
strongholds of the Jews in Khaybar and the Christians in Najrik, after
he found the justification he needed to expel them from the Arabian
Peninsula without being unjust or unfair. Hence he prevented the
centres of plotting £ram having the opportunity to set out plans to
destroy the Islamic state.

1.7.3. The right to security, the sanctity of
the home, and freedom of ownership
Islam affirms the right to security in many verses of tbe Qur'an
and ahideeth of the Prophet WJ. Allah ( g )says:
(... Let there be no transgression except against a&-@rilimoon [the
polytheists, and wrong-doers].)
(Qur'an 2: 193)

d... Whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress
likewise against him...b
(Qur'an 2: 194)
Islam also affirms the right to life, which is broader in scope
than the right to security, because the latter refers to a negative action
on the part of the state, namely refraining from any aggressive or
threatening act, whereas the right to life includes, on top of that, a
positive action, namely protection of people and their blood fiom any
aggression or threat, and making this protection a common
responsibility which is to be shouldered by all the people, because
unlawful aggression agamst one of them is like aggression against all
of them.143Allah (%) says:
(Because of that, We ordained for the Children of Israel that if
anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or [and] to spread
mischief in the land - it would be as if he !died all mankind, and if

anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all
mankind...)
(Qur'an 5: 32)
On the basis of the words of the Qur'an and the actions of the
Prophet W
- J, 'Umar durjng his caliphate guaranteed the individual's
right to security and to life, and he strove hard to maintain these rights
and protect them against any mischief. 'Umar (&) used to say: "I
have not appointed my governors over you to whip you, slander your
honour and seize your wealth, rather I have appointed them to teach
you the Book of your Lord and the Sunnah of your Prophet. Whoever
is wronged by his governor, let him refer the matter to me so that I
may settle it."144
It was also narrated that 'Umar said: "There can be no certainty
that a man will not confess (to a crime) if he is starved, frightened and
detained."145 These words of 'Umar's indicate that it is not
permissible to obtain a confession fi-om a suspect under pressure or
by means of threats, whether the means used are physical, such as
depriving him of his stipend or confiscating his wealth, or
psychological, such as resorting to threats and scaring him with all
kinds of punishment.
With regard to the sanctity of the home, Allah has forbidden us
to enter houses or dwellings without the agreement of their occupants
or in a manner other than those which are customary. Allah (&)says
concerning this matter:

40' you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until
you have asked permission and greeted those in them; that is better
for you, in order that you may remember. And if you find no one
therein, still, enter not until permission has been given. And if you are

And He also says:

(Qur'an 2: 189)

And:

d... And spy not...b

(Qur'an 49: 12)

The sanctity of the home was guaranteed and protected at the
time of 'Umar (&) and the time of the Rightly-Guided
Freedom of ownership was also guaranteed and protected at
the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, to the fullest extent affirmed
by Islamic shari'ah. When 'Urnar found himself compelled, for
political and strategic reasons, to expel the Christians of Najrin and
the Jews of Khaybar fiom the heart of the Arabian Peninsula to Iraq
and Syria, he ordered that they be given land that was like their old
land, in the places to which they were moved, out of respect for and
in a h a t i o n of the right to individual ownership which is
guaranteed by Islam to ah1 adh-dhimmah just as it is guaranteed to
the ~ u s l i r n s . ' ~ ~
When 'Umar found himself compelled to take possession of
some houses in order to expand al-Masjid al-Hardm in Makkah, the
fair compensation that he gave to their owners was no less than an
acknowledgement on his part of the individual right of possession,
which means that it is not permissible to confiscate property even in
cases of necessity without &st giving fair compensation to the
owners.148

Abu B a b k appointment of 'Umar as his successor

At the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, freedom of
ownership did not exist in an absolute sense, rather it was limited by
the rules of shari'ah and the common interest. It was narrated that
Bilil ibn al-Hirith al-Muzani came to the Messenger of Allah &)
and asked him to allocate some land to him, and he gave him a vast
area of land. When the caliphatepassed to 'Umar, he said to him: "0'
Bilil, you asked the Messenger of Allah (s)
to allocate a vast piece
of land to you, and he gave it to you, because the Messenger of Allah
@) could not refuse anyone who asked him for something. But you
do not have the means to make full use of what you have in your
possession." He said, "Yes (that is so)." 'Umar said, "So look at what
you are able to make good use of, and keep it, and what you cannot
make full use of, give it to us so that we may share it out among the
Muslims." He said, "By Allah, I will not do that, because it was
'Umar said, "By Allah,
given to me by the Messenger of Allah (g)."
you will certainly do it." And 'Umar took that which he was not able
to make good use of and shared it out among the ~ u s l i m s . ' ~ ~
This indicates that individual ownership is strongly connected
to the public interest. If the owner is able to look after the property
and take good care of it as a trustee, then no one has the right to
dispute his ownership. But if that is not the case, then the ruler has the
right to intervene in the event of negligence.l5'

1.7.4. Freedom of opinion
Islam fully guarantees the individual the freedom of opinion,
and this right was guaranteed and protected during the time of the
Rightly-Guided Caliphs. 'Umar used to leave the people to express

p. 207.

their opinions and he gave the oppoaunity to reach their own
conclusions in matters concerning which there was no text.
It was narrated that 'Umar met a man and said: "What did you
do?' He said, " 'Ali and Zayd passed such and such a judgement."
He said, "If it were me, I would have ruled in such and such a
manner." He said, 'What kept you fiom doing that when you are the
ruler?" He said, "Ifthere was clear evidence concemjng your issue in
the Book of Allah or in the Sunnah of His Prophet @), I would have
overridden their judgement, but my judgement is based on my
personal opinion, and everyone has the right to express his own
~~in~on."'~'
Similarly, 'Umar let the Sahibah express their own opinions
conceming matters that are subject to ijtihad, and he did not prevent
them ftom reaching their own conclusions or force them to follow a
specific view. Criticizing and advising the ruler, at the time of 'Umar
and the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, was something that was open to all.
'Umar stood up and delivered a speech in which he said: "0'
people, whoever among you sees any crookedness in me, let him
straighten it." A man stood up and said: "By AUah, if we see any
crookedness in you, we will straighten it with our swords." 'Umar
said: "Praise be to Allah Who has put in this ummah people who will
straighten the crookedness of 'Umar with their swords."'"
It is narrated that 'Umar said, in the speech he gave when he
assumed the position of caliph: "Help me against (the evil of) myself
by enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, and by
offering me advice."'53

'Umar regarded the practice of constructive political freedom
(sincere advice) as obligatory upon the people, and as a right to which
the ruler was entitled, as he said: "0' people, we have rights over
you: sincerity towards us in our absence and help in doing good."'54
And he believed that any individual member of the ummah
had the right to watch bim and straighten any crookedness, even if
that was done by the sword, if he deviated from the right path. He
said: "0' people, whoever among you sees any crookedness in me,
let him straighten it."Is5 And he used to say: "The most beloved of
people to me is the one who points out my faults."'56
And be said: "I fear that I may make a mistake and no one
among you will correct me out of respect for me."'57
One day a man came to him and said to him -in the presence
of witnesses
"Fear Allah, 0' 'Umar!" Some of those present
became angry and wanted to silence him, but 'Umar said to them:
"There is no goodness in you if you do not say it and there is no
goodness in us if we do not listen."158
-

One day he stood and addressed the people, and hardly had he
said: "0' people, listen and obey," but one of them interrupted him
and said, "We will not listen and obey, 0' 'Umar." 'Umar calmly
asked, "Why not, 0' slave of Allah?" He said, "Because each one of
us has been given a single shirt from the fabric to cover his 'awrah."
'Umar said to him, "Wait a minute." Then he called his son
'Abdulla ibn 'Umar, and 'Abdullih explained to him that he had

given his father his own share of the fabric to make his garment
complete, and the Sahribah were convinced by that. A man said, with
humility and respect: "Now we will listen and obey, 0' Amew alM~'mineen."'~~
One day he delivered a khufbah and said: "Do not give more
than forty uqiyahs in dowries to women, even if she is the daughter of
Dhu al-Qis~ah- i.e., Yazeed ibn al-Husayn. Whoever gives more
than that, I will seize the extra amount and put it in the bayt al-ma^l."
A woman objected to that and said, "You do not have the right to do
that!" He asked, "Why not?" She said, "Because Allah, the Exalted,
Almighty says:

B... And [if] you have given one of them a Qintrir [of gold, i.e. a great
amount as Mahr], take not the least bit of it back; would you take it
wrongfully without a right and [with] a manifest sin?)
(Qw'nn 4: ZO)."

'Umar said: "Awoman is right and a man is wrong."16' According to
another report, he said: "0' Allah, forgive me! Everyone has more
knowledge of religion than 'Umar." Then he went back and ascended
the minbar and said: "0' people, I used to forbid you to give women
more than four hundred dirhams in their dowries, but (now) whatever
anyone wants to give of his wealth of his own accord, let him do
so,x161

expressing one's opinion, whether that harm affects everyone or a
particular individual. Among the things that 'Umar prohibited and
restricted are the following:

Misguided and misleading opinions concerning
Islam and following ambiguous issues

1.7.5. ' U d s view on marriage to
Jewish and Christian women
When 'Umar came to know that Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamin had
married a Jewish woman, he wrote to him, telling him to let her go.
Hudhayfah wrote back to him saying: "Are you claiming that it is
harcim so that I should let her go?" He said, "I do not say that it is
harcim, but I fear that you (plural) may marry the immoral ones
among them." According to another report he said, "I fear that you
will neglect Muslim women and many immoral women."172
Abu Zuhrah said: 'We must state here that it is preferable for a
Muslim not to marry anyone but a Muslim woman, so that there will
be perfect harmony between them in all ways. 'Umar (&) forbade
maniage to women of the people of the Book (i.e., Jewish and
Christian women) except in cases where it sewed a higher purpose
such as forging political ties by means of which he hoped to bring
people together and open their hearts towards Islam, and so on."'73
Allah tells us in His Book that marriage to a believing woman,
even if she is a slave, is better than marriage to a mushnk woman,
even if she is free. AUah (&) says:
dAnd do not many al-Mushrikrit [idolatresses] till they believe
[worship Allah Alone]. And indeed a slave woman who believes is
better than a [fke]Mushrikah [idolatress], even though she pleases
you. And give not [your daughters] in maniage to al-Mwhn'koon till
they believe [in Allah Alone] and verily, a believing slave is better
than a [keel Mwhrik [idolater], even though he pleases you. Those
[al-Mushribon] invite you to the Fire, but Allah invites [you] to
Paradise and forgiveness by His Leave, and makes His Ayit Lproofs,
Its isnad is faheeh. Tafseer Ibn Kafheer, 11265.

evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.] clear to mankind
that they may remember.)
(Qur 'an 2: 221)

In this verse, Allah forbids marriage to mushrik women until they
believe in AUah and in His Prophet, and He rules that a slave woman
who believes in Allah and His Messenger- even if she is black and
poor -is superior to a free mushrik woman even if she is beautiful,
of good lineage and wealthy. By the same token, Allah forbids
believing women to marry mushrik men even if the mushrik is more
handsome, of better lineage and more wealthy than a be1ie~er.l~~
Although marriage to mushrik women is forbidden according
to this verse, marriage to Jewish and Christian women is permissible
according to another verse, namely:

8... pawful to you in marriage] are chaste women from the believers
and chaste women kom those who were given the Scripture [Jews
and Christians] before your time...)
(Qur'an 5: 5)
This is a text which defines further the general meaning of the
first text. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars.175But they
still say that marriage to a Muslim woman is preferable. This applies
if there are no negative consequences that will affect the husband, the
children or the Muslim society. But if there are negative
consequences, then the suling is that such marriages are not allowed.
This is the view of some contemporary scholars176,and it is a view in
which 'Umar ibn al-Khasb set a precedent, as he was the first one to
disallow marriage to Jewish and Christian women, on the basis of the
following two points:

1. That it leads to Muslim girls being "left on the shelf" and doomed
to a life of spinsterhood.

2. That the Jewish or Christian woman may corrupt the morals and
religious commitment of the Muslims' children.

These two reasons are sufficient grounds for this prohibition, but if
we look at our own times we will see many other, new, negative
consequences which make the reason for prohibiting such marriages
Professor Jameel Muhammad Mubikak listed a
even more urgent.'77
number of these negative consequences,which include the following:
1. The wife from among the people of the Book may have a mission
of spying on the Muslims
2. The introduction of k@r customs and ways into the Muslim lands
3. It exposes the Muslim to acquiring the nationality of the kufir
4. The ignorance of Muslims who many women of the people of the
Book may make them like putty in the hands of those women, to be
moulded and shaped easily
5. Those who are married to women of the people of the Book may
feel inferior, which is something caused by ignorance of the religion
of ~ l l a h ' ~ '

These negative consequences are sufficient to indicate that it is
forbidden to marry Jewish and Christian women in our times.
The limits which 'Umar set on marriage to Jewish and
Christian women were in harmony with the greater interests of the
state and with the greater aims of the Muslim society. Nations which
are advanced understand the harm that is caused when their men
many foreign women, and the danger that these marriages may bring
to the homeland - whether inadvertently or deliberately; so they

'Umar ibn al-KhGfrib

221

impose limits, especially on their representatives and public figures,
which is a valid and justifiable precaution. Awife knows many, if not
all, of her husband's secrets, depending on the level of harmony and
love that exists between them. Hence 'Umar (4)
set a precedent for
all rulers who came aRer him, by understanding that marriage to
women of the people of the Book could lead to grave consequences,
for they are strangers among us who differ from us in all ways, and
most of them remain Jewish or Christian and do not taste the
sweetness of Islam with its loyalty and respect towards the husband.
'Umar understand all of that because of his knowledge of his religion
and his sound understanding of human nature, and of what was
beneficial and harmful to the Muslims. So he issued his orders on the
matter immediately and in a decisive manner.179
Freedom was protected and guaranteed at the time of the
Rightly-Guided Caliphs, but it also had limits and restrictions. Hence
the society flourished and advanced. Freedom is a basic right for
individuals and societies, by means of which they realize themselves
and fulfil their potentials. If freedom is taken away from a society, its
most important fundamentals are taken away and it becomes as if it is
dead.
Freedom in Islam sheds rays of light which make man
conscious of his connection with Allah, and through this connection
man can rise to the most sublime levels. He becomes eager to do
righteous deeds and hastens to seek the pleasure of the Lord of
heaven and earth. Freedom is one of the foundations of the Muslim
society which was realized during the time of the Rightly-Guided
Caliphs in the most sublime form, a shining example which reflects
down throughout history.180

1.8. The expenditure of the caliph,
the introduction of the Hijri calendar and the
introduction of the title Ameer al-Mu'mineen
1.8.1. The expenditure of the caliph
Because the caliphate is a religious act and a means of drawing
closer to Allah, the one who takes on this role and does well in it
should be rewarded, and his reward is with Allah, Who rewards the
one who does good for his good deeds, and requites the one who does
evil for his evil deeds.181 Allah (&) says:
(So whoever does righteous good deeds while he is a believer [in the
Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism], his efforts will not be
rejected. Verily, We record it for him [in his Book of deeds].)

That has to do with his reward in the Hereafter. With regard to his
reward in this world, the caliph who devotes his efforts to the

'Umar ibn al-Khattrih

223

When 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb became the leader of the Muslims
after Abu Bakr, for a while he did not take anything from the b a y t almcil, until he started to suffer poverty as a result when his earnings
from trade were no longer enough, because he was distracted from
his business by the affairs of the people. He sent word to the
Companions of the Messenger of Allah @) and consulted them
about that. He said: "I have been distracted (from earning a living) by
(&) said,
this matter; what am I entitled to?" ' U t h h ibn '"Eat and feed others." This was also the view of Sa'eed ibn Zayd ibn
'Amr ibn ~ u f a ~ 1'Umar
. l ~ ~said to 'Ali (&), "What do you say
about that?" He said, "Breakfast and dinner," 'Umar followed that,
and he explained what he was entitled to from the bayt al-mcil by
saying, "I regard my entitlement h m the bayt al-mcil as being like
the share of one who takes care of an orphan: if I can do without it
then I will not take it, but if I need it, I will take from it on a
reasonable basis."186
It is reported that 'Umar went out to a group of the Sahribah
and asked them: "What do you think -is any of the wealth of Allah
(i.e., the wealth in the bayt a l - m i l ) permissible to me?" They said,
"The Ameer al-Mu 'mineen knows better than us about that." He said,
"If you wish, I will tell you what is permissible for me of it: a riding
beast to take me for Hajj and 'Umrah, a suit for the winter and a suit
for the summer, sufficient food for my dependents, and my regular
stipend l i e any other Muslim, for I am just a Muslim man."
Mu'ammar said: "What he used to ride to go to Hajj and 'Umrah was

Abu Bakr k appoinment of 'Umar as his successor

The Rightly-Guided Caliph 'Umar set the highest example for
rulers of fulfilling the trust that they have undeaaken. Abu Dawood
narrated that M2lik ibn Aws ibn al-Hadathk said: "One day 'Umar
ibn al-KhaGb mentioned the fay' (war booty) and said, 'I have no
more right to this booty than you, and no one among us has more
right to it than anyone else, except in accordance with our status as
indicated by the Book of Allah and the way in which the Messenger
divided the booty: so a man may be given in accordance
of Allah
with his seniority, his efforts, the number of his dependents, and his
need.' "la'

a)

It was narrated from ar-Rabee' ibn Ziyiki al-Hkithi that he
came to 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb (&) and was surprised at his
appearance and the way he carried himself. He said: "0' Ameer alMu'mineen, the one who is most entitled to fine food, a fine mount
and fine clothing is you" - for he used to eat coarse food. 'Umar
lifted up a palm leaf that he had with him and struck him on the head
with it, then he said, "By Allah, you did not say that for the sake of
Allah. All you wanted was to appease me. I thought you were better
than that. Woe to you, do you know the likeness of me and these
people (the Muslims)?" He said, "What is the likeness of you and
these people?" He said, "It is like some people who set out on a
journey and gave their money to one man, saying, 'Spend on us.'
Would it be permissible for him to keep any of it for himself?" He
said, "No, 0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen." He said, "That is the likeness of
me and them."'89
Thefirqaha ' derived a number of rulings on the expenditure of
the caliph from the teachings of the Prophet &) and the time of the
Rightly-Guided Caliphs. These include the following:

~ n - ~ a w a w iIbn
' ~ al-'~rabi'~',
~,
al-~ahooti'~'and Ibn Muflihlg3dl
stated that this is permissible.
2. The caliphs Abu Bakr and 'Umar both accepted payment for that.
3. Their taking that payment was in return for their devoting all their
time to taking care of the Muslims' affairs, as Abu Bakr and 'Umar
both stated.

4. The caliph has the right to take that payment whether he needs it or
not. Ibn a l - ~ u n e e rwas
' ~ ~of the view that it is preferable for him to
take it, because if he takes it that will be more helpful to him in doing
his work than if he were not to take it, because then he will feel that
his work is an obligation upon him.'95

1.8.2. The introduction of the hijri calendar
The hijri calendar is regarded as a development that had a
major cultural impact. The first one to introduce this system was
'Umar. There are several reports which speak of the reason for that.
It was narrated that Maymoon ibn M a h h said:
"A document that was dated in Sha'bgn came to 'Umar, and he said,
"Is this Sha'bin of last year, or Sha'bk of the coming year, or the
Sha'bin we are in now?" Then he gathered the Companions of the
Messenger ofAllah and said to them, "Set up something for the people
that they can refer to." Someone suggested using the Byzantine

(Roman) calendar, but it was pointed out that it was too long as they
dated it from the time of Dhn al-Qamayn. Someone else suggested
using the Persian calendar, but they said that every time a new king
came along, he abolished what had gone before. Then they agreed to
look at how long the Messenger ofAUah (#g) had stayed inMadeenah,
and they found that he had stayed there for ten years, so they based
their calendar on the Hijrah of the Messenger of Allah
It was narrated that 'Uthmin ibn ' ~ b a ~ d u i l i said
h ' ~ that
~ he
heard Sa'eed ibn al-Mnsayyib say: " 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb gathered
the Muhijireen and An@ together and said, 'From when should we
date our history?' 'Ali ibn Abi Taib (&) said to him, 'From the time
when the Prophet @) came out of the land of shirk' i.e., from the day
he migrated. So 'Umar ibn al-Kha$b (&) adopted that date for the
beginning of the calendar."
And it was narrated that Sa'eed ibn al-Mnsayyib said: "The
first one to establish the calendar was 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb (&),
two and half years into his caliphate. He reached a decisioi in
consultation with 'Ali ibn Abi 7"alib."'98
Abu a z - ~ a n i i d said:
' ~ ~ " 'Umar consulted others concerning
the calendar, and they agreed upon the ~ i j r a h . " ~ ~ ~
Ibn Hijr narrated the reason why they chose M & m a m for the
beginning of the calendar and not Rabee' al-Awal, the month in
which the Prophet &) actually migrated: the Sahibah who advised
'Umar suggested four events that could be used as the starting-point
for the calendar: the Prophet's birth, the beginning of his mission, his

Hijrah and his death. But they found that there was some dispute as to
the year of his birth and the beginning of his mission, and they
abandoned the idea of dating the calendar from his death because that
would provoke grief and sorrow in the Muslims. So there was no
other option left but the H~jrah.And they put it back from Rabee' alAwwal to Mulprram because the initial resolve to migrate came in
Muharram. The second Pledge of al-'Aqabah, whlch was the
precursor to the Hijrah, had taken place in Dhu al-Hg~ah;the fust
new month to begin after that pledge and resolve to migrate was
Mu?mrrarn, so it was apt that this month should be chosen for the
beginning of the calendar... Then Ibn Hajar said: "This is the most
appropriate event to be regarded as the beginning, which took place
in ~ & a r r a m . " ~ ~ '
By means of this important administrative event, 'Umar
contributed to the creation of unity throughout the Arabian
Peninsula, based on unity of religion, unity of the nation with no class
differences, and unity of purpose by having a single calendar. Thus
he was able to face his enemies, confident of v i c t o ~ ~ . ~ ~ ~

1.8.3.The title of Ameer al-Mu'mineen
When Abu Bakr (&), who had been known as Khaleefah
Rasoolullrih (The Successor of the Messenger of Allah) died, the
Muslims said: "Whoever comes after 'Umar will be known as the
Successor of the Successor of the Messenger of Allah &),and that
will be too long-winded; let us agree upon a title which may be given
to the caliph, by which successive caliphs may be addressed." Some
of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said: "We are the

believers (al-Mu'mineen) and 'Umar is our leader (Ameer)." So
'Umar was called Ameer al-Mu 'mineen,and he was the first one to be
given this title.'03
It was narrated from Ibn Shihib that 'Umar ibn 'Abdul-'Azeez
(&) asked Abu Bakr ibn Sulaymh ibn Abi KhaythamahZo4:
"Why did Abu Bakr (4)used to write, 'From Abu Bakr, the
Successor of the Messenger of Allah &),' whereas 'Umar (&)
used to write, 'From 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, the Successor of Abu
Bakr? Who was first one to write "From Ameer al-Mu 'mineen?' He
said, 'My grandmother asb-Shifa'205, who was one of the first
women to migrate, and when 'Umar went to the market he used to
visit her, told me that 'Umar ibn al-Khagb wrote to a governor in
1raqZo6saying: 'Send me two noble and strong men so that I can ask
them about Iraq and its people.' The governor of Iraq sent him
Labeed ibn Rabee'ah and 'Adiyy ibn Hitim. They came to
Madeenah and dismounted in the courtyard of the mosque, then they
enteredthe mosque, where they found ' A m ibn a&'& (may Allah be
pleased with him). They said to him, '0' 'Amr, ask permission for us
to enter and meet the Ameer al-Mu'mineen.' 'Amr entered and said,
'Peace be upon you, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen.' 'Umar said to him,
'Why are you calling me by this name, 0' son ofal-'As? You have to
tell me where you got these words from.' He said, 'Yes. Labeed ibn
Rabee'ah and 'Adiyy ibn Hitim came and said, 'Ask permission for
us to enter and meet the Ameer al-Mu'mzneen,' and I said, 'By AUah
you have got his name right, for be is the leader and we are the

Thus 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b
was the first one to be called Ameer
al-Mu'mineen, and no one did that before him. If the researcher
studies the words of the Companions of the Prophet (may Allah be
pleased with them all), he will see that they were all agreed upon this
title, so this title became well known throughout all the regions
during his reign?09

2. 'Umar's Character, his Family Life
and his Respect for Ah1 al-Bayt
(The Prophet's Household)
2.1. The most important characteristics of 'Umar
The key to 'Umar's personality is his faith in Allah and his
preparations for the Last Day. This faith is the reason for the
remarkable balance in the personality of 'Urnar ibn al-Kha@?ib(A).
Thus his strength did not undermine his fairness, his authority did not
undermine his mercy, and his richness did not undermine his
humility. Thus he deserved the help and support of Allah, and he
fulfilled the meaning of Tawheed by knowledge, certain faith,
acceptance, submission, sincerity, and love. He had a sound
understanding of the true nature of faith and the meaning of T M e e d ,
and the effects of his deep faith were manifested in his life. The most
important effects of that hith were:

Abu B a k k appoinrment o f 'Umar as his successor

2.1.1. His deep fear of Allah which
led him to take stock of himself
'Umar (&) used to say: "Remember the Fire a great deal, for
its heat is mtense, its bottom is deep and the stay therein is long."210
One day a Bedouin came to him and said:
"0' good 'Umar, may you be rewarded with Paradise. Give me
something to support my daughters and their mother. I adjure you by
Allah to do it."
He said, "If I do not do it, what then, 0' Bedoum?" He said, "By
Allah, you will be questioned about it... and there will only be either
Hell or Paradise."
'Umar wept until his beard became wet with his tears, then he sad,
"0' slave, give him this shirt of mine because of that Day, not
because of his words, for by Allah I do not own any other shirt."211
'Umar wept greatly because he was moved by the words of thls
Bedouin which reminded him of the Reckoning on the Day of
Resurrection, even though there is no mention that he ever wronged
anyone; rather it was due to his great fear of AUah that he wept before
everyone who remmded him of the Day of ~ e s u r r e c t i o n . ~ ~ ~
Because of his great fear of Allah, he used to take stock of
himself harshly. If he thought that he had wronged someone, he
would look for him and tell him to settle the score with him. He
would go to the people and ask them about their needs; if they told
him about them then he would meet those needs. But he told them not
to distract h ~ mwith personal complaints when he was dealing with

matters of public interest. One day he was busy dealing with some
public matter213when a man came to him and said: "0' Ameer alMu'mineen, come with me and help me deal with so and so, for he
has wronged me." 'Umar raised his stick and hit the man on the head,
and said, "You ignore 'Umar when he comes and checks on you, then
when he is busy dealing with the Muslims' affairs you come to him!"
The man went away complaining, then 'Umar said, "Bring the man to
me!" When they brought him back, 'Umar threw the stick to him and
said, "Take the stick and hit me with it as I hit you." The man said,
"No, 0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen. I give it up for the sake of Allah and
for your sake." 'Umar said, 'Not like that. Either give it up for the
sake of Allah and seeking the reward that is with Him, or give it up
for my sake." The man said, "I give it up for the sake of Allah, 0'
Ameer al-Mu'mineen." The man went away, and 'Umar went into his
house214,accompanied by some people among whom was al-&af
ibn Qays, who narrated what he saw, "... He started to pray and he
prayed two rak'ahs then sat. He said, '0' son of al-Kha@b, you were
lowly and Allah raised you in status; you were astray and Allah
guided you; yon were humble and AUah honoured you, then He put
you in charge ofthe Muslims. Then a man came asking your help and
you hit him. What will you say to your Lord tomorrow when you
meet Him?' And he started to criticize himself in a manner that made
me think that he was the best of the people on earth."'15
It was narrated from I y b ibn Salamah that his father said to
him: " 'Umar (&) passed by whilst I was in the market, going on
some errand carrying a stick. He said, 'Move out of the way, 0'
Salamah!' then he dealt me a blow with the stick but it only hit the
edge of my garment. I moved out of the way and he said no more

until the following year, when he met me in the market and said, '0'

He said, 'By AUah, I have not forgotten it yet.'"216
'Umar (&) used to say, when he was checking himself: ''Take

yourselves before you are weighed, and prepare yourselves for the

Because of his great fear of Allah and his strictness in taking stock of
himself, he would say: "If a lamb were to die on the banks of the
Euphrates, I would fear that Allah might call 'Umar to account for
it.n218
It was narrated that 'Ali (4)
said: "I saw 'Umar ibn alKhagb (&,) rushing by on a camel and I said, '0' Ameer alMu 'mineen, where are you going?' He said, 'One of the zakah camels

who come after you.' He said, '0' Abu al-Hasan, do not blame me,

displeased with you. Did I not tell you to designate one sink for men
and another for women?' Then he went away and was met by 'Ali
and he said to him, 'I fear that I may be doomed.' He asked,
'Why would you be doomed?' He said, 'I hit men and women in the
Haram (Sanctuary) of Allah.' 'Ali said, '0' Ameer al-Mu'mineeu,
you are a shepherd (in charge of the people); if you did that out of
sincerity and in order to set thiigs right, Allah will never punish you,
but if you hit them for no reason then you are the wrongdoer.' "220

It was narrated that al-Hasan al-Basri said: "Whilst 'Umar

verse:

He went to Ubayy ibn Ka'b and entered his house when he was
sitting on a cushion. He took it from beneath him and said, 'Take it,
0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen.' He kicked it away with his foot and sat
down, and recited the verse to him, and said, 'I am afraid that I am the
one referred to in this verse, and that I have annoyed the believers.'
He said, 'You cannot but keep an eye on your people, and issue
commands and prohibitions.' 'Umar said, 'I see what you mean, but

Abu B a k k appoinlment of 'Umar as his successo7

Sometimes 'Umar would light a 6re and put his hand over it
and say: "0' son of al-KhaMb, can you bear this?"Z2Z
When Sa'd ibn Ahi Waqqas sent the cloak, sword, pants, shirt,
crown and shoes of Chosroes to 'Umar after the battle of alQ%disiyah,'Umar looked at the people and the tallest and most well
built of them was SurSlqah ibn Ja'tham al-Madlaji. He said: "0'
S d q a h , get up and put these clothes on." He stood up and put them
on, and he hoped to keep them. 'Umar said to him: "Walk over
there," so he walked away. Then he said, "Come back," so he came
back. Then he said: "Excellent! A Bedouin £rom Banu Madlaj
wearing the cloak, trousers, sword, belt, crown and shoes of
Chosroes. What a day, 0' S N a h , when you are wearing some of
the belongings of Chosroes. It will be an honour for you and your
people. Take it off." So S d q a h took it off, and 'Umar said: "[O'
Allah], You withheld this from Your Messenger and Prophet, and he
was dearer to You than me, and You withheld it from Abu Bakr, who
was dearer to You than me, then You gave it to me. I seek refuge from
You lest Your giving it to me be a test." Then he wept until those who
were with him felt sony for him. Then he said to ' A b d u r - R b k "I
urge you, sell it and share out (its price) before evening comes."223
And there are many similar stories.

2.1.2. His asceticism (zuhd)
From his living the Qur'an, spending time with the Prophet
(Blessings and peace be upon him) and thinking about this life,
'Umar understood that this world is the realm of tests and trials, and
as such is a preparation for the Hereafter. Hence he was free of the

influence of this world and its dazzling attractions, and he submitted
himself fully to his Lord, both outwardly and inwardly. He reached
conclusions that took root in his heart and helped him to renounce
pleasure in worldly things. Among these conclusions were the
following:

1. Certain faith that in this world we are like strangers or passers by,
as the Prophet (@) said: (("Be in this world as if you are a stranger or
a passer by. ,,))zi4
2. Certainty that this world is of no value before the Lord of Glory,
except for what is done in obedience to Allah. The Prophet (gg)said:
cct'If this world were worth a gnat's wing before Allah, He would not
give a Efir a drink of water fiom
And he said, cc"This world
is cursed and everything in it is cursed, apart fiom remembrance of
Allah and the like, or a scholar, or a seeker of k u ~ w l e d ~ e . " ~ ) " ~
3. Its time is almost over. The Prophet (&J said: (("The Hour and I
have been sent like these two," (and he gestured with) his index
finger and middle finger.>)z27

4. That the Hereafter is what will abide, as the believer among the
family of Pharaoh said:

passing] enjoyment, and verily, the Hereafter that is the home that
will remain forever. Whosoever does an evil deed, will not be

The truths that took root in Umar's heart caused him to despise
this world and its vanities, and to renounce its pleasures. There
follow some examples of his attitude which indicate his renunciation
of this transient realm.
It was narrated that Abu a l - ~ s h h a b 'said:

world we would not care if we gave orders that a female goat be
cooked for us, and we would order that the finest bread be baked for
us, and raisins be soaked for us in vessels until they were like the eyes

save our pleasures, because we have heard that Allah will say (on the
Day of Resurrection),

'Umar said: "I thought about the matter, and I realized that if I
wanted this world, that would damage my prospects in the Hereafter,
and if I wanted the Hereafter, that would damage my prospects in this
world, and if this is the case, I would rather my prospects be damaged

He delivered a speech to the people when he was caliph,
wearing an izrir (waist wrapper) on which there were twelve
patches 232,and he circumambulated the House of AUah wearing an
izrir on which there were twelve patches, one of which was made of
red leather.z33
He was late one Friday, then he came out and apologized to the
people for keeping them waiting. He said: "I was late because of this

garment."234
It was narrated that 'AhdulEh ibn ' k i r ibn Rabee'ah said: "I

Makkah and hack again, and no tent was set up for him. He used to
put a cloak or a mat on a tree and shade himself beneath itz3'

if he were the lowliest of the people, or one of the common folk.
One day the Mother of the Believers Hafsah (r&) entered his
place and saw that he was living a harsh and asceticlife. She said:
"Allah has bestowed a lot of good things upon us, and has granted
you ample provision. Why do you not eat food that is better than this,
and wear finer clothes than this?" He said, "You tell me whether this
is right or wrong." And he mentioned the Messenger of Allah @)
and the hard life that he lived, and he kept reminding her of how the
Messenger of Allah @) had lived when she was with him, until he
made her weep. Then he said, "I had two companions who followed a
certain path, and if I follow a hard path, perhaps I will join them in
their life of luxury (in ~aradise)."'~~
Worldly comforts were readily available to 'Umar (&), and
many nations were conquered during bis reign, but he never batted an
eyelid and was not attracted to them at all. Rather all his happiness
came from supporting the religion of Allah and striving to weaken
the mushrikeen. Asceticism was a prominent feature of his
character.237Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqg
said: "By Allah, 'Umar ibn
al-Kha@b was not the earliest of us to migrate, hut I know why he is
better than us: he was the most abstemious of us towards worldly
matters."238

brought to 'Umar. He ordered that they be shared out, then he said:
"0' Allah, You know that I have not given them provision and I will
never keep it for myself except if I share their food. I am a h i d lest
You make it fire in the belly of 'Umar." Ma'din said, "Soon I saw
him take a vessel of his own and put it between him and the vessels of
the Muslims. The Ameer al-Mu 'mineen 'Umar wanted to eat with the
ordinruy Muslims, because of the social benefits that that would
bring, but he did not want to eat from the food that had been made
with the public wealth of the Muslims, so he ordered that his own
food, that had been made from his own wealth, be brought to him.
This is a sublime example of integrity and piety, because there is no
reason why his eating with the Muslims from their public wealth
should be hardm, because he was one of them, but he wanted to
refiain from that, seeking thereby what is with Allah. Because of his
deep fear of Allah, he was worried that this might be an ambiguous
matter, so he took steps to protect himself."239
It was narrated that 'Abdur-Rahin ibn Nujayh said: "I stayed
with 'Umar (4)
and he had a she-camel which he used to milk. His
slave came and poured some milk for him one day, and he objected to
the taste. He said, 'Woe to you! Where did you get this milk fiom?'
He said, '0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, the she-camel's calf had free rein
and drank all her milk, so I milked one of the camels from the wealth
of Allah for you.' He said, 'Woe to you, you have given me fire to
drink!' and he asked permission fiom some people to drink that milk,
and they said, 'It is permissible for you, and its meat too.'Z40This is
the piety of 'Umar (&,) - he feared the punishment of Allah for
drinking that milk, even though he had not done so deliberately, and
he could not feel at ease until he had asked permission for that from
some of the senior Sahdbah (may Allah be pleased with them) who

240

represented the Muslims in that matter. This report and others like it
indicate that the thought of the Hereafter with its reckoning and
reward or punishment dominated 'Umar and was foremost in his
thoughts, to such an extent that it controlled his conduct in this
life.241 'Umar was deeply pious, and that extended to what he
thought was his right and what was not his right. One day he fell sick,
and they gave him some honey as a remedy. There was some honey
in the bayt al-mcil which had been brought from one of the conquered
lands. 'Umar would not take the honey, as the doctors advised him to
do, until he had gathered the people, ascended the minbar, and asked
the people for permission: "If you give me permission (
will
I take it),
otherwise it is harim for me." The people wept out of compassion
for him, and they all gave h i permission, and they said to one
another: "What a man you are, 0' 'Umar! You have made it difficult
for the caliphs who come afier

2.1.4. His humility
It was narrated that 'Abdullih ihn 'Abbk said: "Al-'Abbis
had a downspout which jutted out over a path used by 'Umar. 'Umar
had put on his Friday clothes and two chickens had been slaughtered
for al-'Abbb. When 'Umar came past the downspout, water that had
been thrown over the blood of the chickens came out and splashed
onto 'Umar. 'Umar ordered that the downspout be removed, then he
went back and took off his clothes and put on some clothes that were
not his. Then he came and led the people in prayer. Al-'Abbis came
to him and said, "By Allah, that is the place where the Messenger of
Allah (g)
put it." 'Umar said to al-'Abbb, "I insist that you climb

on my back and put it back in the place where the Messenger of Allah
&) put it." So al-'Abbk did that.243
It was narrated that al-Hasan al-Ba~risaid: " 'Umar went out
on a hot day, holding his cloak over his head. A young man passed by
on a donkey and he said, '0' young man, let me ride with you.' The
young man got down off the donkey and said, 'Ride, 0' Ameer alMu 'mineen.' He said, 'No; you ride and I will ride behind you. Do
you want me to have the more comfortable place (in the fiont) and
you ride in the less comfortable place (at the back)?' So he rode
behind the young man, and entered Madeenah riding behind him,
with the people looking on."244
It was narrated that S i n k ibn Salamah al-Hudhali said: "I went
out with some other boys to pick up balah dates, and there was
'Umar ibn al-Khagb carrying a stick. When the young men saw him,
they scattered amongst the date palms. I stood up and there were
some of the dates I had picked up in my izcir. I said, '0' Ameer alMu 'mineen, this is what the wind blew down.' He looked at what was
in my izcir and did not hit me. I said, '0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, the
other boys are ahead of me now, and they will take all the dates I
have.' He sad, 'No (they will not). Move!' and he came with me to
my family."z45
A delegation came fiom 'Iraq to 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb, among
whom was a l - M a f ibn Qays. It was an intensely hot summer day
and 'Umar had wrapped his head in an 'abayah and was daubing the
zakah camels with pitch. He said: "0' &af, put aside your garment
and come and help the Ameer al-Mu'mineen with this camel, for
these are the zakah camels, to which the orphans, widows and poor

are entitled." A man among the people said, "May Allah forgive you,
0' Ameer el-Mu'mineen. Why don't you tell one of the slaves who
look after the zakah to take care of it?" 'Umar said, "What slave can
be more of a slave than me or al-A!xmf? The one who has been
appointed in charge of the Muslims' affairs owes them the same
duties of sincerity and fulfillment of the trust as a slave owes to his
master."z46
It was narrated that 'Urwab ibn az-Zubayr (&) said: "I saw
'Umar ibn al-Khagb carrying a vessel ofwater on his shoulder, and I
said, '0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, you should not have to do this.' He
said, 'When the delegations came to me listening and obeying, 1felt a
little proud, and I wanted to put a stop to that.'"247
It was narrated that Anas ibn Mil& (&) said: "I heard 'Umar
say one day, when I had gone out with him t i a garden and there was
a wall between me and him, and he was inside the garden, ' 'Umar
ibn al-Khagb, the Ameer al-Mu'mineen. Well done! By Allah, 0'
little son of al-Khat&b, you should fear Allah or else He will punish

It was narrated from Jubayr ibn Nufayr that: "A group of
people said to 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, 'We have never seen any man
who judges more fairly, speaks the truth more plainly and is more
harsh in dealing with the hypocrites than you, 0' Ameer alMu 'mineen.You are the best of people after the Messenger of Allah

said, 'Abu Bakr.' 'Umar said, ' 'Awfis right, and you are lying. By
AUah, Abu Bakr was better than the scent of musk when I was still
more astray than my people's camel' - i.e., before he became
Muslim, because Abu Bakr became Muslim six years before
him,,,250
This is indicative of 'Urnar's humility and his respect for the
virtuous, which was not limited only to those who were still alive, but
included those who had died too. He did not agree to deny their virtue
or ignore their memories, and he continued to speak well of them on
every occasion; he strove to make the people respect those noble
characters and not forget the great deeds they had done. Thus good
deeds were perpetuated from one generation to another, and
righteous deeds were not forgotten just because the ones who had
done them were absent or had passed away. This is a sign of loyalty
and faith.251
'Umar did not approve of ignoring the virtue of the one who
bad held this position before him, or allowing it to be forgotten, for
the nation which forgets or neglects the memory of those who have
served it is a nation which is doomed to fail. Is it not better for the
people to be taught about these sublime characters? 'Umar had
learned the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger &), so
he was disciplined in a manner which books of morals and manners,
both ancient and modem, are unable to attain. The Book of Allah is
still in our hands, and the S m a h of the Messenger of Allah @) is
still preserved among us, in which there is incomparable learning and
morals and manners.252

2.1.5. His forbearance
It was narrated that Ibn 'AbbG (&) said:
'Uyaynah ibn Hasn ibn Hudhayfah came and stayed with his
~ one
~ of ~the group
,
who
brother's son, al-Hnrr ibn ~ a ~whos was
were close to 'Umar. The righteous were the companions and
advisors of 'Umar, whether they were old or young. 'Uyaynah said to
his brother's son, '0' son of my brother, you are close to the caliph,
so seek permission for me to enter and meet him.' He said, 'I will ask
permission for you to meet him." Ibn 'Abbis said, 'So al-Hnrr asked
for permission for 'Uyaynah to enter and 'Umar gave him permission
to enter. When he entered, he said, '0' son of al-Khaeb, by Allah,
you are not generous with us and you do not judge fairly among us.'
'Umar became angy and wanted to punish him, but al-Hurr said to
him, '0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, Allah, the Exalted, Almigbty said to
His Prophet:
"

$Show forgiveness, enjoin what is good, and turn away from the
foolish [i.e. don't punish them].)
(Qur'an 7: 199)
- and this is one of the foolish."

By Allah, 'Umar did not do

respect to the Book of ~ l l a h . When
down and turned away from the man who had slandered his character
by accusing him of miserliiess and slandered his religious
commitment by accusing him of being unfair in sharing out wealth.
This is what 'Umar was striving hard to achieve. Who among us can
exercise such self-restraint at the time of anger?

'Umar ibn al-Khagbb

245

When 'Umar delivered a speech in al-Jibiyah in Syria, he
spoke of wealth and how it was to be divided, and of other matters,
among which he said: "I apologize to you for Khilid ibn al-Waleed,
for I ordered him to keep this money for the weak among the
Muhijireeiz, but he gave it to the strong, the noble and the eloquent.
So I dismissed him and appointed Abu 'Ubaydah ibn a l - J a
instead." Abu 'Amr ibn Haf? ibn al-Mugheerah stood up and said,
"By Allah, that is not acceptable, 0' 'Umar. You have dismissed
someone who was appointed by the Messenger of AUah @J, and
you have sheathed a sword that was unsheathed by the Messenger of
Allah &), and you have dismantled something that was set up by the
Messenger of Allah -. and YOU have broken the ties of kinship and
envied your cousin." 'Umar (&) said: "You are a close relative and
young in age, and you are angry because he is your cousin."

(a),

These are some of the attributes which were the h i t s of
'Umar's Tawheed and faith in Allah, and his preparations to meet
Allah, the Exalted, Almighty. The scholars have discussed the
features of his personality, the most important of which were the
strength of his religious commitment, courage, strong faith, fairness,
knowledge, experience, deep insight, dignity, strength of character,
farsightedness, generosity, setting a good example, compassion,
seriousness, resolve, toughness, piety and awareness of Allah. And
they discussed his leadership skills as demonstrated during his
caliphate, among the most important of which were his listening to
criticism, his ability to motivate people and get the job done, his
taking part in decision-mhg on the basis of shoora, his
adaptability and flexibility during emergencies, and his keeping a
close eye on his governors and agents. Throughout this book the
reader will note these characteristics and more, but I do not want to
list them all here for fear of being repetitive.

2.2. His life with his family
'Umar (&) said: "The people will be honest with their ruler
so long as the ruler is honest with AUah, and if the ruler is dishonest,
the people will be dishonest."255
Hence 'Umar was very strict in checking on himself and his
family. He knew that people were looking at him and watching
closely, and that there was no point in being strict with himself if he
let his f d y have free rein, for which he would be brought to
account in the Hereafter and for which people would not show any
mercy in this world. When 'Umar forbade the people to do
something, he would go to his family and say: "I have forbidden the
people to do such and such, and the people are watching you as a bird
watches a piece of meat. If you break the rules, then so will they, but
if you r e h i n then so will they. By Allah, if a man is brought to me
who has done that which I forbade the people to do, I will punish him
double, because of his relationship to me. So whoever among you
wants (to do that), let him go ahead, and whoever wants to refra'm, let
him do so."256And he used to keep a very close eye on the actions of
his children, wives and relatives. There follow some examples:

2.2.1. Public facilities
'Umar forbade his family to make use of public facilities that
had been set up by the state for the benefit of certain people, fearing
lest he show favouritism to his fimily therein. 'Abdulla ibn 'Umar
said: "I bought some camels and let them graze in al-Hima (a
common grazing area set up by the state), and when they grew fat I
brought them (to sell). 'Umar entered the market and saw some fat

camels. He said, "Whose are these camels?" It was said, "They
belong to 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar." He started saying, "0' 'Abdullih
ibn 'Umar. .. the son of the Ameer al-Mu'mineen. What are these
camels?" I said, "Camels which I bought and sent to a l - m ,
seeking what any other Muslim would seek." He said, "And they
said, Take care of the camels of the son of the caliph, water the
camels of the son of the caliph. 0' 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar, see what
your capital is, keep it and give the pmfit to the bayt al-mcil of the
~uslims."~~~

2.2.2. His calling his son 'Abdd5h to account

for what he bought of the booty of JaIooIa'
'Abdullih ibn 'Umar said: "I was present at Jaloola' -one of
the battles in Persia - and I bought some of the booty for forty
thousand. When 1 came to 'Umar he said, 'What do you think if you
were shown the fre and it was said to you, 'Pay a ransom'? Would
you not pay a ransom? It is as if I can see the people when they were
buying and selling, saying, 'It is 'AbduLlih ibn 'Umar, the
Companion of the Messenger of Allah @) and the son of the caliph
and the most beloved of people to him,' and that is true. So they
would rather give you a lower price than a higher price. I am in
charge of dividing the booty and I will give you most of what a
merchant of Quraysh would make; for each dirham you are allowed
to make one dirham.' " Then he called the traders and they bought it
from him for four hundred thousand d i r h a m , and he gave me eighty
thousand dirhams, and sent the rest to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqiis to share
it

2.2.3. Not allowing facilities to be
brought because of ties of kinship
It was narrated that Aslam said: " 'Abdullih and 'Ubaydullih
the sons of 'Umar went out with an army to Iraq, and when they came
back, they passed by Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, who was the governor
of Bqra. He welcomed them and said, 'If there is anything I can do
for you, I shall.' Then he said, 'Yes, here is some of the wealth of
Allah which I want to send to the caliph. I will lend it to you to buy
some goods kom Iraq which you can sell in Madeenah, then you can
give the capital to the caliph and keep the profit.' So they did that,
and he wrote to 'Umar, telling him to take the money kom them.
When they came to 'Umar, he said, 'Did he lend to the whole army as
he lent to you?" They said, "No." 'Umar said, "Give me the wealth
and the profit." 'Abdullih kept quiet, but 'Ubaydullih said, "You
should not do that, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen. If the money had been
lost or dimmished, we would have paid it back." He said, "Give me
the money." 'Abdulla kept quiet, and 'Ubaydullih kept saying the
same thing. Then a man among those who were sitting with 'Umar
said, "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, why don't you make it a partnership
(profit sharing)?"259So 'Umar tookthe capital and half of the profits,
and 'Abdull& and 'Ubaydulla took the other half of the profits,
They said that this was the first partnership in Islam.

2.2.4. Giving precedence to U s h a h ibn
Zayd over 'Abdd31 ibn 'Umar (may
Allah be pleased with them) in giving
'Umar used to divide wealth and he would give precedence to
some people over others on the basis of who came to Islam h t and

'Umar ibn al-KhaMb

249

who was related to the Prophet (g).
So he gave U s h a h ibn Zayd
(&) four thousand, and he gave 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar (&) three
thousand. He said: "0' my father, you gave U s h a h ibn Zayd four
thousand and you gave me three thousand. Is his father's virtue not
the same as yours, and is his virtue not the same as mine?" 'Umar
I)
said, "His father was more beloved to the Messenger of Allah @&
than your father, and he was more beloved to the Messenger of Allah
@) than you."260

2.2.5. "I spent on you for a month"
'Asim ibn 'Umar said: " 'Umar sent Yarfa' (his freed slave) to
me and I came to him and found him sitting in the mosque. He
praised Allah, then he said, 'I do not think that any of the wealth is
permissible for me before I become in charge of it, except by right.
Then when I become in charge of it, it cannot be more impermissible
for me. I spent on you from the wealth of Allah for a month, but I am
not going to give you any more. And I gave you some of the produce
ofal-'A1iyah, so take its price and go to one of the merchants of your
people and stay by his side. If he buys or sells anything, go in
partnership with him and spend on yourself and on your family.' So I
went and did that."261

2.2.6. "Take it, 0' Mu'ayqeeb, and
put it in the bayt al-miil"
Mu'ayqeeb said: 'Umar sent for me to come at noon time, and
I found him in a house demanding money from his son '&im. He
said to me: "Do you know what this one has done? He went to Iraq

and told them that he was the son of the caliph, and asked them for
money, so they gave him vessels, silver and other goods, and a
decorated sword." '&im said, "What did I do? All I did was go to
some of my people and they gave me this." 'Umar said, "Take it, 0'
Mu'ayqeeb, and put it in the bayt a~-rnri1."~~~
This is an example of caution with regard to the wealth that a person
acquires by virtue of his position. When 'Umar felt that his son '&im
had acquired this wealth because ofhis being the son of the caliph, he
was uncomfortable with the idea of letting him keep it, because he
had not acquired it through any effort on his part, so it came under the
heading of doubtful matters.263

2.2.7. 'Atikah, the wife of 'Umar, and the musk
Some musk and amber came to 'Umar (&) from Bahrain, and
'Umar said: "By AUah, I wish that there was a woman who was good
at weighing, who could weigh this perfiune for me so that I could
divide it among the Muslims." His wife 'Atikah bint Zayd ibn 'Amr
ibn Nufayl said to him, "I am good at weighmg; let me weigh it for
you." He said, 'Wo." She said, "Why not?" He said, "I am afraid that
you might take it and do this" -and he put his finger on his temple
and said, "and wipe your neck thus you will get more than the other
~nslims."~"
This is an example of 'Umar's piety and his cautious approach in
matters of religions commitment. He refused to let his wife take
charge of dividing this perfume lest she wipe some of it on her neck,
in which case she would have gotten some of the wealth of the
Muslims.

Ibn 'Umar said: "Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari gave a mat to 'Umar's
wife 'Atikah bint Zayd, and I think that it was one cubit and a
handspan. 'Umar saw it with her and said, 'Where did you get this
&om?' She said, 'Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari gave it to me.' 'Umar took it
and hit her on the head with it, then he said, 'Bring Abu Moosa to
me.' So he was brought to him and he (Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari) said,
'Do not be hasty, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen.' 'Umar said, 'What made
you give gifts to my womenfolk?' Then 'Umar took it and hit him
over the head with it, and said, 'Take it, we have no need of it.'

to his wife Umm Kulthoom
Al-Us&& al-Khuw stated in his lectures that when the
Byzantine king stopped attacking and sent letters to 'Umar and hied
to approach him, and 'Umar sent envoys to him with the mail, Umm
Kulthoom bint 'Ali ibn Abi ralib sent some p e r h e , cups and
women's combs to the Byzantine queen. These things reached her,
and the wife of Caesar gathered her women and said: "This is a gift
&om the wife of the king of the Arabs, and the daughter of their
Prophet." So she wrote to her and sent her a gift,which included a
valuable necklace. When the mail reached 'Umar, he ordered that it
be detained, then he order that the call "w-Saldtu Jdmi 'ah (prayer is
about to begin)" be given. The people gathered and he led them in
praying two rak'ahs, then he said: "There is no goodness in any
matter that is decided without consultation (shoora). Tell me what
you think about this gift which the wife of the Byzantine king has
given to Umm Kulthoom." Some of them said, "It is hers in return

for her gift." He said, "But the envoy was the envoy of the Muslims
and the mail was their mail." So he ordered that it be placed in the
bayt al-mil and that she be given something equivalent in value to
what she had spent.266

2.2.10. "Umm Sulayt has more right to it"
It was narrated that Tha'labah ibn Abi Ma& said: " 'Umar ibn
al-Kha@b shared out some aprons among the women of Madeenah,
and there was one fine apron left over. Some of those who were with
him said, '0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, give this to the daughter of the
Messenger of Allah @J who is with you' - meaning Umm
Kulthoom the daughter of 'Ali. But 'Umar said, 'Umm Sulayt has
more right to it.' Umm Sulayt was one of the women of the An@r
who had sworn allegiance to the Messenger of Allah (g).
'Umar
said, 'She used to prepare food for us on the day of Ul?ud.'"267

2.2.11. "You have been insincere towards your father
and have been sincere towards your relatives"
Some wealth was brought to 'Umar, and news of that reached
HafSah (I$+) the Mother of the Believers. She said: "0' Ameer alMu'mineen, your relatives have a right to this wealth. Allah has
enjoined that close relatives be given a share of this wealth." He said,
'0'my daughter, my relatives have a right to my wealth, but this
wealth belongs to the Muslims. You have been insincere towards
your father and have been sincere towards your relatives. Get up and
leave.'

2.2.12. "Do you want me to meet
Allah as a treacherous king?"
A son-in-law of 'Umar came to him and asked 'Umar to give
him something kom the bayt al-mil. 'Umar rebuked him and said,
"Do you want me to meet Allah as a treacherous king?" Later on, he
gave him ten thousand dirhams from his own ~ e a l t h . 2 ~ ~
These are some incidents which demonstrate how 'Umar
refrained fiom taking anythmg fiom the public wealth, and prevented
his relatives and his family korn benefiting korn his position of
authority. If 'Umar had allowed himself and his family fiee rein, they
would have indulged and those who came after them would have
indulged too. The wealth of Allah was under the control of the rulers,
and it is natural, as we have seen all too often, that when a ruler
stretches out his hand towards the public wealth, things go out of
control and the bayt al-mil or the government's budget soon
becomes defunct; things soon reach a level where this treachery is no
longer hidden and the entlre system collapses. It is well known that if
a person is content, rehins from touching people's wealth and
respects their rights, that makes them love him, and if he is their ruler,
they will support him and obey him sincerely, and he will be dearer to
them than their own selves?70
From the way in which 'Umar dealt with his family and his
relatives, we can see one aspect of the way in which he conducted his
role as caliph, which is setting a good example in both his private and
public life. 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib said concerning him: "Yon exercised
restraint and your people exercised restraint; if you had been
dishonest, they would have been dishonest. The fact that he practised
what he preached and was tougher in checking on himself and his

254

Abu Bakr 's appoiniment of 'Umar as his successor

family than with his governor and agents brought him great respect
kom the people, and the elite and common folk alike trusted him.'"
Such was 'Umar, the Rightly-Guided Caliph, who reached an
exemplary pinnacle through Islamic discipline. Faith in Allah filled
his heart, a deep faith which made him an example for later
generations. Faith in AUah and adherence to the teachings of this
religion are still the tools which wiU make a leader the best possible
example kom now until the Day of ~esurrection?~~

2.3. His respect and love for the
Prophet's family (Ah1 al-Bayt)
Undoubtedly the family of the Prophet @J enjoy a high status
and level of respect from Ah1 as-Sunnah wa al-Jam6 'ah, who honour
the rights which Allah has prescribed for Ahl al-Bayt. They love them
and regard them as fiends, and they follow the recommendations of
the Messenger of Allah &), which he spoke of on the day of
Ghadeer Khum: <<"Iremind you of Allah concerning the members of
) ~ ~ ~are the happiest of people to take this
my h o ~ s e h o l d . " ~They
advice and follow it; they reject the way of the RiXdis who go to
extremes concerning of the members of the Prophet's family, and the
way of the Neibis who insult them and hate them. Ahl as-Sunnah are
unanimously agreed that it is obligatory to love Ah1 al-Bayt and it is
harim to offend them or mistreat them in word or deed?74 'Umar
(&) demonstrated and explained to us the beliefs ofAhl as-Sunnah
concerning Ah1 al-Bayt (family of the last Prophet) in the way in
which he dealt and interacted with them.

2.3.1. His dealings with the wives of the Prophet (B)
'Umar (&) used to check on the wives of the Prophet (@)
and give generously to them. He would not eat any fme food or fruit
without sending some of it to the wives of the Prophet WJ; the last
one to whom he would send anything was Haf~ah,and if there was
any shortfall, she would be the one whose share would be affected.''
He also used to send their stipend to them. The following is the story
of an incident which took place with the Mother of the Believers
Zaynab bint J&sh (I$+). When he had worked out the shares of the
Muslims, 'Umar sent to the Mother of the Believers Zaynab bint
J&sh (%) her share. When it was brought to her, she said: "May
Allah forgive 'Umar; my sisters are better able to handle a share like
that than me." They said, "This is all for you." She said, "Suben
Allih." Then she hid herself fiom him behind a curtain, and said,
"Put it down and cover it with a cloak." Then she said to Barzah bint
Rifi': "Put your hand in and take a handful, and give it to Banu So
and so (among her relatives and orphans under her care)." She shared
it out until there was a little left under the cloak, then Barzah said:
"May Allah forgive you, 0' Mother of the Believers, by Allah we
have a right to that." She said, "You may have whatever is beneath
this cloak." She lifted up the cloak and found eighty-five dirhams.
Then she raised her hands towards heaven and said: "0' Allah do not
let me live until the next time 'Umar distributes shares." Then she
died, and she was the first of the Prophet's wives to join h i m may
Allah be pleased with her.276
Another example of how 'Umar honoured the wives of the
Prophet @) was narrated by the Mother of the Believers 'kishah
(I&,), who said: " 'Umar ibn al-Khasb used to send to us our share

When the wives of the Prophet &) asked 'Umar for
permission to go for Hajj, he refused to give them pemussion until
they insisted. Then he said: "I will give you permission next year, but
this is not what I think." He sent ' U W ibn 'A& and 'AbdurRa?nnh ibn 'Awf with them, and told them to travel one m front of
them and one behind, and not to walk alongside them. When they
wanted to stop, they were to stop in a mountain pass and (the two
men) were to stay at the entrances to the pass so that no one would go
to or visit them. And he told them that when they circumambulated
the Ka'bah, no one was to circumambulate with them except other
women.278

2.3.2. 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (&) and his children
'Umar showed a great deal of respect to the family of the
Messenger of AUah
and preferred them over his own children
and family. We will mention some examples of that:

a)

(4)

mentioned that: " 'Umar said to h i
Al-Husayn ibn 'Ali
one day, '0' my son, why don't you come and join us sometimes?'
So I came one day hut he was alone with Mu'iwiyah, and Ibn 'IJmar
was at the door but was not granted admittance, so I went back. He
met me after that and said, '0' my son, did I not see you coming to
us?' I said, 'I came but you were alone with Mu'iwiyah, and J saw
Ibn 'Umar come back, so I came back.' He said, 'You have more
right to be given permission to enter than 'Ahdullih ibn 'Umar, for all
the blessings we have, as you can see, are caused by Allah, then you
(i.e., Ah1 al-Bayt),' and he lay his hand on his head."z79

'Umar ibn al-KhaMb

257

Ibn Sa'd narrated &om Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-B%ir that his
father, 'Ali ibn al-Husayn, said: "Some suits were brought to 'Umar
&om Yemen and he distributed them to the people, and they put them
on. He was sitting between the (Prophet's) grave and the minbar, and
the people were coming and greeting him and making du 'd ' for him.
Then al-Hasan and al-Husayn came out of the house of their mother
Fztimah
and passed among the people, and they were not
wearing a& of those suits. 'Umar fi-owned, then he said, 'By Allah, I
am not happy about what I have given you.' They said, '0' Ameer alMu 'mineen, you gave clothes to your people and you did well.' He
said, 'I am not happy because of two young men who were passing
among the people and were not wearing any of these suits because
they were too big or too small for them.' Then he wrote to Yemen
asking that two suits be sent quickly for al-Hasan and al-Husayn.
Two suits were sent to him and he gave them to them."280

(a)

It was narrated &om Abu Ja'far that when he wanted to decide
how much each Muslim was entitled to after Allah had granted
conquests (and wealth started coming in), he gathered some of the
Companions of the Prophet (&J and 'Abdur-Ra?miin ibn 'Awf (&)
said: "Start with yourself." H: said, "No, by Allah, (I will start) with
those who are closest to the Messenger of Allah &) and Banu
H%him, the tribe of the Messenger of Allah @J." So he allocated
something to al-'Abhh, then to 'Ali, until he had given to people
&om five different tribes, ending with Banu 'Adiyy ibn Ka'b, and he
wrote it down: those of Banu Hiishim who were present at Badr,
those of Banu Umayyah ibn 'Abd Shams who were present at Badr,
then the next closest and the next closest. He allocated their shares to
them, then he allocated shares to al-Hasan and al-Husayn, because of
their position in relation to the Messenger of Allah M).~''

Abu Bakr S appointment of 'Umar a s his successor

The scholar Shibli an-Nu'mini said in his book al-Fcirooq,
under the heading, "Rights and etiquette between the family and the
that 'Umar (&) did not make
Companions [of the Prophet
any decision about any serious matter without consulting 'Ali, who
used to advise him with all sincerity. When he travelled to Bayt alMaqdis (Jerusalem), he appointed 'Ali in charge of matters of
caliphate in Madeenah. The harmony and solidarity between them
was further confirmed when 'All gave his daughter U r n Kulthoom,
who was the daughter of FStimah (I$&), to 'Umar in marriage '", and
named one of his own children 'Umar, just as he had named another

Abu Bakr and a third ' ~ t h m i n ?No

'Ali ibn Abi Tilib was the first one whom 'Umar ibn alKhatjib consulted (may Allah be pleased with them both), and 'Umar
used to consult him about all matters, both major and minor. He
consulted him when the Muslims conquered Jerusalem, and when alM&in was conquered, and when 'Umar wanted to go to Nahawand
and fight the Persians, and when he wanted to go out and fight the
Byzantines, and concerning the establishment of the Hijri calendar,
and other matters?85
Throughout the life of 'Umar, 'Mi was a sincere advisor who
feared for 'Umar's life. 'Umar loved 'Ali and there was deep
affection and mutual trust between them. Yet despite that some
people still insist on distorting history and narrating repolts that suit
them and their whims and desires, so as to give us a picture of the
Rightly-Guided Caliphs which suggests that they were all plotting

against one another and all their affairs were run from behind the

scene^."^
Dr. al-Booti says: "One of the most obvious things that will be
noticed by anyone who studies the caliphate of 'Umar is the distinct
and pure-spirited cooperation between 'Umar and 'Ali (may Allah be
pleased with them both). 'Ali was 'Umar's primmy adviser in all
issues andproblems, and whenever 'Ali offered a suggestion, 'Umar
would adopt it out of conviction. It is sacient for you to know that
he said, 'Were it not for 'Ali, 'Umar would be doomed.' As for 'Ali,
he was very sincere in all his affairs and in all situations. You have
seen how 'Umar consulted him about going at the head of the army to
fight the Persians. His advice was sincere advice that reflected his
love and care for 'Umar, telling him not to go, and to run the war
from where he was. He warned him that if he went, then he would
leave a vacuum behind him that would be more dangerous than the
enemy whom he wanted to confront. Do you think that if the
Messenger of Allah @) had declared that 'Ali was to be the caliph
after him, that 'Ali would have turned away from the command of the
Messenger of Allah
and supported those who had supposedly
usurped his right, or rather his duty, to become caliph, m such a
sincere and constructive manner? Would the Sahbbah (may Allah be
pleased with them) have ignored the command of the Messenger of
Could it even be imagined that they, led by 'Ali, would
Allah (g)?
have unanimously agreed to that? So it is easy to draw the obvious
conclusion, that up until this time -the end of 'Umar's reign, and
indeed up until the end of 'Ali's reign - the Muslims had been
united, and there had not been any confusion in the mind of any
Muslim with regard to the caliphate and who was most entitled to
it, ,3287

2.3.3. The dispute between al-'Abbb and 'Ali (may
AUah be pleased with them) concerning the booty of
the Messenger of Allah (@) from Banu an-Nudayr
M i l k ibn Aws said: "Whilst I was sitting with my family
before noon, a messenger came to me from 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb,
and said, 'Come to the Ameer al-Mu'mineen.' So I went with him to
'Umar, and found him sitting on a bare bed, with no mattress, leaning
on a leather cushion. I greeted him with salim and sat down, and he
said, '0' M w some families from your people have come to us and
I have ordered that some shares be allocated to them. Take them and
divide among them.' I said, '0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen,would that you
told someone else to do that.' He said, 'Take them (and do that).'
Whilst I was sitting with him, his doorkeeper Yarfa' came to him and
said, 'Will yon give 'Uthmh, 'Abdw-Ra?mh ibn 'Awf, az-Zubayr
and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqis permission to enter?' He said, 'Yes.' So he
let them in, and they came in and sat down. Then Yarfa' sat down for
a little while, then he said, 'Will you let 'Ali and 'Abbk come in?'
He said, 'Yes.' So he let them in, and they came in and gave the
greeting of salim and sat down.
'Abbb said, '0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, judge between me and this
one.' They were disputing about the booty that Allah had granted to
His Messenger @) from the wealth of Banu an-Nu~jayr.The group,
'Uthrnh and his companions, said, '0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, judge
between them and give them a break kom one another.' 'Umar said,
'Wait a minute. I ask yon by Allah, by Whose permission the heaven
and eaah exist, do you know that the Messenger of Allah (gZJ said,
cc'We cannot be inherited from; what we leave behind is charity')) and
the Messenger of Allah @) was referring to himself?' The group
said, 'He did say that.' g hen 'Umar turned to 'Ali and 'Abbis and

more about this matter. AUah allocated something special in this
booty which He did not give to anyone else.' Then he recited:
(And what Allah gave as booty [ F a y l to His Messenger

either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Messengers
over whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.b

said, 'I ask you by Allah, did I not give it to you on that basis?' They
said, 'Yes.' He said, 'And now you are seeking a different judgement
kom me? If you are not able (to dispose of it properly), then give it to

2.3.4. ' U d s respect for al-'Abb;s
and his son
'Abdullsh (may Allah be pleased with them both)
'Umar (&) demonstrated to the ummah the virtue of al'Abbb ibn 'Abdul-Mumlib, the paternal uncle of the Messenger of
Allah @,), and how much he respected him and honoured his rights,
when he prayed for rain by virtue of al-'Abbh in the year of arM d a h , as we will describe below insha' ANih. Indeed, 'Umar
swore to al-'Abbh, as we have seen above, that his becoming
Muslim was dearer to him than his own father's becormng Muslim
would have been, if it had happened, because al-'AbbL's becoming
Muslim was dearer to the Messenger of Allah
As a sign of the love that 'Umar ibn al-KhatJiib had for the
cousin of the Messenger of Allah &), 'Abdulla ibn 'Abbh (&),
he used to admit him to the gatherings of the senior Sahibah, those
who had been present at Badr, although they had sons the same age as
him, and no one else shared this privilege. This is indicative of his
virtue, knowledge and status with 'Umar. Bukhari narrated with an

gave it back to him.

sons like him?' He said, 'Because of what you know about him.' He
called them one day and called me with them, and I do not think that
he invited me that day except to show them my knowledge. He
asked, 'What do you say about,

your enemies] and the Conquest [of Makkah]. And you see that the
people enter AUah's religion [Islam] in crowds...8 (Qur'an 110.1-2)?'
Some of them said, 'We do not know,' and some of them did not say
anything. He asked me, '0' son of al-'Abbk, do you say the same?' I
said, 'No.' He then asked, 'Then what do you say?' I said, 'It is

him that when the help of Allah came and the conquest of Makkab,
that is a sign that your death is approaching, so glorify the praises of

we can see Islam embodied in his life. There follow some examples.

3.1.1. 'Umar (&) and his concern
for the women in society
'Umar (&,) was concerned about the Muslims' womenfolk
and daughters, and the old women. He would give them their rights
and relieve them of any wrongs that were done to them. He would
take care of families whose menfolk were away on jihad, and make
sure that widows got their rights. In a well-known comment, he said:
"By Allah, if I live longer I will not leave any widow of the people of
Iraq in need of anyone else after this year."z94 There follow some

shining examples of his care for women:

"May your mother be bereft of you,
how could you check on 'Umar?"
'Umar went out in the darkness of night and saw T a w ibn
'Ubaydullih (&). 'Umar went and entered one house, then he
entered another house. The following morning, Tabah went to that
house and found a paralyzed, blind old woman. He said to her, "Who
is this man who comes to you?" She said: "He has been taking care
of me for such and such a time. He brings me what I need and takes
away any rubbish for me." Tabah said (to himself): "May your
mother he bereft of you, how could you check on mar?"'^^
Concern for the weaker members of society is one of the main
factors of success, and one of the greatest means of drawing closer to
Allah. The leaders of Islamic movements, rulers of Muslim peoples,
Imams of mosques and Muslims in general should pay attention to
this aspect of their societies.

"Allah heard this woman's complaint
fiom above seven heavens"
'Umar came out of the mosque accompanied by al-Jarood al'Abdi, and there was a woman who had come out into the street.
'Umar ihn al-Khaeb greeted her with salim and she returned his

Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, 0' woman!" 'Umar said, "Let her be. Don't

you know who this is? This is Khawlah bint Tha'labah, whose words
Allah heard 6om above seven heavens, so 'Umar is more obliged to
listen to her."296 According to another report, "By Allah, even if she
stood and spoke until night came, I would not leave her except to go
and pray, then I would come back to her."z97 And according to
another report: "This is Khawlah concerning whom Allah revealed
the words:

"Welcome to our close relatives"
It was narrated from Zayd ibn Aslam that his father said:
"I went out with 'Umar ibn al-Khagb (+$) to the market, and a
young woman ran after 'Umar and said, '0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen,
my husband has died and left behind young children. By Allah they
cannot take care of themselves and they own nothing, and I am aftaid
that the hyena will eat them. I am the daughter of Khuyaf ibn Eema'
al-GhiYki 299,and my father was present at al-Hudaybiyah with the
Messenger of Allah @).' 'Umar stood with her and did not move on.
He said, 'Welcome to our close relatives.' Then he went to a strong
camel that was tied near the house and loaded it with two big vessels
which,he filled with foodstuff, and he placed money and clothing

between them. Then he gave the reins to her and said, 'Take it, for it
will not finish until Allah gives you some more.' A man said, '0'
Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, you have given her too much.' 'Umar said,
'May your mother be bereft of you! By Allah, I saw the father and
brother of this woman besieging a fortress for a long time, then we
conquered it, then the next morning we shared out the booty because
of their actions.' "300
This is indicative of 'Umar's loyalty towards everyone who
had done something for Islam, even if it was only a little. What
loyalty is this, and how great is our need for it in these times when
there is hardly any loyalty among many people.30'

His proposal of marriage to U m m Kulthoorn
the daughter of Abu Bakr
'Umar ibn al-Kha@b @) went to 'kishah the Mother of the
Believers (I$&) to ask her for the hand of her younger sister Umm
Kulthoom in marriage. 'kishah spoke to her sister, who replied: "I
have no need of that." 'kishah asked, "Are you rejecting the Ameer
ul-Mu 'mineen?" She said, "Yes, for he lives a hard life and is very
strict with women." 'kishah sent for 'Amr ibn al-'As and told him
about that, and he said, "0' Mother of the Believers, don't worry, I
will sort it out." Then he went to 'Urnar and said, "0' Ameer alMu 'mineen, I have heard some news, but do not be upset about it."
He said, "What is it?" He asked, "Did you propose maniage to Umm
Kulthoom bint Abi Bakr?" He then said, "Yes. Does she think that
she is not fit for me or that I am not fit for her?" He said, "Neither, but
she is young and has been brought up in the care of the Mother of the
Believers 'kishah, in a very soft and gentle manner, and you are
harsh and we feel scared of you, and we cannot stand in your way, so

how about if she goes against you in any matter and you treat her
harshly? You would have mistreated the child of Abu Bakr in a
manner that is not right." 'Umar asked, "How about 'kishah when I
have spoken to her?" He said: "I will take care of that, 0' Ameer alMu ' m i r ~ e e n . " ~ ~ ~

According to another report, 'Amr ibn al-'A~said: "0' Ameer
al-Mu'mineen, why don't you get married?" 'Umar said: "Perhaps
that will be during the next few days." 'Amr said: "Who do you have
in mind?" 'Umar said: "Umrn Kulthoom bint Abi Bakr." 'Amrsaid:
"What do you want with a young woman who is mourning her father
day and night?" 'Umar said: "Did 'kishah tell you to say that?"
'Amrsaid: "Yes." So he left her alone and Talhah ibn 'Uhaydullih
married her.303
One of the wishful thoughts that a young girl may have is to
many the leader of her people. But here the caliph came proposing
marriage without being forceful or imposing. With all fkeedom and
determination the girl said no to the caliph and the caliph accepted
that and gave up, without feeling upset or distressed, and without
issuing threats and warnings, because he knew that Islam does not
force a girl to marry someone she does not want. 'Amrwas very
eloquent in the manner in which he conveyed news of the refusal, and
'Umar was very smart in realizing the source thereof despite 'Amr's
delicacy and tact.304Indeed, 'Umar defended the right of girls to
agree to those who proposed marriage to them when he said: "Do not
force your daughters to many an ugly man, for they like what you

standing with your wife in the street, making the Muslims talk about

came back with her husband and 'Umar asked him, "Do you h o w

turned to him and said, "Do not let what you have seen me to do to

'Umar said to a man who was thinking of divorcing his wife:
"Why do you want to divorce her?" He said, "I do not love her."
'Umar said, "Must every house be built on love? What about loyalty
and appreciation?"307

The provision of the sons of al-Khnnsa'
When the four sons of al-Khansa' were martyred and the news
reached 'Umar, he said: "Give al-Khansa' the provision of her four
sons, and continue to do that until she passes away." And she
continued to take two hundred dirhams for each of them each month,
until she passed away.308

During the era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, women had the
status to which Islam had raised them, so during that era we see
women participating in many fields, such as the intellectual, literary
and business spheres. 'kishah, Umm Salamah, Habeebah bint Umm
Habeebah, h a bint Kurayz ibn 'Ahd Shams and Asmi' bint
Salamah at-Tameemiyah were all highly accomplished in the fields
of hadith, fiqh, literature and issuingfatwas. Other women excelled
in poetry, such as al-Khansa' and Hind bint ' ~ t b a h . ~ "'Umar
acknowledged women's virtue and recognized that they were
creatures with feelings, opinions and thoughts. Just as he consulted
men, he also consulted women, and he gave precedence to the
opinion of ash-Shifa' bint 'Abdnlliih al-'Adawiyah. So what is left
for women to look for outside of Islam, when the caliph himself
consulted women concerning the affairs of state and accepted their
opinions?311 'Umar regarded himself as being like a father with
children. He would go to the women whose husbands were absent
and stand at their doors, saying, "Do you need anything? Do any of
you want to buy anything? For I would not like you to be cheated in
buying and selling." And they would send their slave women with
him, and he would enter the market followed by a host of women's
slaves; he would buy for them whatever they needed, and if any of
them could not afford to pay he would buy it with his own wealth.
When an envoy came fiom the border, 'Umar would take the letters
fiom their husbands to them himself, and he would say: "Your

with him." Then he would go around to them with paper and ink and
say: "Here are ink and paper; come close to the door so that I can
write for you." And he would take the letters from those women and
send them to their husbands.312

3.1.2. Remembering and acknowledging
righteous deeds
'Umar used to remember and acknowledge righteous deeds
that the Muslims had done in the past. He was an excellent judge of
character, and he said: "Do not be deceived by a man's eloquence;
rather whoever fulfils trusts and refrains from impugning people's
honour is a real man."313And he used to say: "Do not look at a man's
prayer or fasting; rather look at his reason and honesty." And he said:
"There are two (types of) men I do not fear for you: a believer whose
faith is obvlous and a kcijir whose kufi is obvious. Rather I fear for
you the hypocrite who hides behind a show of faith but strives for
some other purpose." 'Umar asked about a man who had given
testimony, wanting to find out whether anyone could vouch for him.
A man said to him: "I will vouch for him, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen."
'Umar asked, "Are you his neighbour?" He said, 'TJo." He then
asked, "Did you mix with him for a day and come to know his real
character?" He said, "No." He asked next: "Did you travel with him?
For travelling and being away from home reveal a man's true
essence?" He said, "No." 'Umar said, "Perhaps you saw him in the
mosque, standing, sitting and praying?" He said, 'Yes." 'Umar said,

"Go away, for you do not know him."314
A number of Muslims earned the praise of 'Umar when Allah
enabled them to serve Islam in great ways. There follow a few
examples of that:

" Y o u believed w h e n they did not, you came
w h e n they turned away, and you were loyal
w h e n they proved treacherous"
It was narrated that 'Adiy ibn Hiitim said: "I came to 'Umar
ibn al-Khaeb with some of my people, and he started giving each
man of Tay' a share of two thousand and ignoring me. I went to him
and he turned away from me. I came and stood in flont of his face and
he turned away from me. I said, '0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, do you
recognize me?' He laughed so hard he nearly fell on his back and
said, 'Yes, by Allah, I recognize you. You believed when they &d
not, you came when they turned away, and you were loyal when they
proved treacherous. The first charity which brought support and joy
to the Messenger of Allah
and his Companions was the charity
of Tay', which you brought to the Messenger of Allah &).' Then he
apologized and said, 'I have allocated it to people who are suffering
extreme poverty, and to the leaders of their tribes, because of the
responsibilities they have.'315 According to another report, 'Adiy
said, 'Then I do not mind."'316

"Become Christian and I will share my kingdom with you and give

"Even if you gave me all that you possess and all that the Arabs
possess to make me give up the religion of Muhammad @J for the
blink of an eye, I would not do it." He said, "Then I will kill you."
He said, "It's up to you." So the king ordered that he be crucified and
that the archers shoot him near his hands and feet, whilst he was
telling him to become Christian, but he refused to do so. Then he
ordered that he be taken down and a huge pot of copper be heated up.
Then one of the Muslim prisoners was brought and thrown into it,
and when he looked there was nothing left but bones. He again told
him to become Christian, but he refused. Then he ordered that he be
thrown into that pot, and he was lifted on a pulley to be thrown in, but
he wept and the king hoped that he would respond and he again told
h i to become Christian. But 'Abdullih said, "I am only weeping
because I have but one soul to be thrown into this pot for the sake of
Allah. I wish that I had as many souls as there are hairs on my body,
so that they may all receive this t o m e for the sake of Allah."
According to some reports, the king imprisoned him and deprived
him of food and drink for several days, then he send wine and pork to
him, but he did not touch them. The king summoned him and said,
"Why did you not eat?" He said: "They were permissible for me (in
that situation), but I did not want to give you the satisfaction." The
king said to him:"Kiss my head and I will let you go." He said: "And
will you let all the Muslim prisoners go?" He said, 'Yes." So he
kissed his head, and he let him go and he let all the Muslim prisoners
go with him. When he came back, 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b said, "Every
Muslim should kiss the head of 'Abdullih ibn Hudhifah, and I will
be the k t , " and he stood up and kissed his head.317

he asked, "Are you Uways ibn ' h i r ? " He answered, "Yes." He
asked, "From M w 3 then &om Qam?" He said, "Yes." He then
asked, "Did you have leprosy, then you were healed of it except for a
space the size of a dirham?" He said, "Yes." He asked, "Do you have

forgiveness for you, then do so.' So pray for forgiveness for me." So
he prayed for forgiveness for him. 'Umar asked him, "Where are you
going?" He said, "Koofah." He said, "Why don't I write a letter for
you to the governor?" Uways said, "I prefer to-live among the poor
and humble people." The following year, one of the noble people (of
Koofah) came back to 'Umar, who met him and asked about Uways.
He said, "I left him in humble circumstances and with meager
say, 'There

That man went to Uways and said, "Pray for forgiveness for me."
Uways said, "Rather you should do that for me, for you have just

'Umar had dishes of food that he would set out afier Fajr. One of
those men came and sat down, and started to eat, using his left hand.
'Umar - who used to watch the people whilst they were eating
said to him: "Eat with your right hand," but he did not respond.
'Umar repeated it, and he said, "0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, it is busy."
When he had finished eating, 'Umar called him and said, "What kept
your right hand busy?" He brought out his arm and the hand was cut
off. 'Umar said, "What is this?" He said, "I lost my hand on the day
of al-Yarmook." He said, "Who does wudoo' for you?" He said, "I
do wudoo ' with my left hand, and Allah helps me." He said, 'Where

It was narrated that 'Umar ibn al-Khatj2b said to his
companions: "Make a wish." One of them said, "I wish that this
house was filled with gold that I could spend for the sake of Allah and
give in charity." Another man said, "I wish that it was filled with
chrysolite and jewels that I could spend for the sake of Allah and give
in charity." Then 'Umar said, "Make a wish." They said, "We do not
know what to say, 0' A m e e r al-Mu'mineen." He said, "I wish that it
was filled with men like Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jar&, Mu'idh ibn

(may Allah be pleased with them), so that I might employ

'Umar described sincere companions as follows: "You should look
for sincere companions, for you will be happy with them; they will be
a source of pleasure at times of ease and a support at times of
calamity. Think positively of your brother until he does something
that justifies your keeping away from hi,and keep away from your
enemy, and beware of your fiend except those who are trustworthy,
and there is no one who is trustworthy except one who fears Allah.

had prayed Fajr,he would go to (that person) and when he met him
he would embrace him.324
And he said: "Were it not that I like to walk for the sake of

differentiating among people. When some of the leaders of Quraysh,
led by Suhayl ibn 'Amr ibn al-Hikith and Abu Sufiyh ibn Harb, and
some former slaves of Quraysh, Suhayb and Bila, came to him, he
gave the poor £reed slaves permission to meet him before he gave
permission to the leaders and nobles of Quraysh. The leaders got
angry, and Abu Sufiyk said to some of his companions: "I have
never seen anything like today. He gives permission to these slaves
and leaves us at his door?" Snhayl said, "0' people, by Allah I can

'Umar kissing the head of 'Ali
(may Allah be pleased with them both)
A man complained about 'Ali to 'Umar, and when 'Umar
looked into the matter he said to 'Ali: "Sit down alongside your
opponent, 0' Abu al-Hasan." 'Ali's expression changed, and 'Umar
passed judgement concerning the matter, then he said to 'Ali, "Did
you get angry, 0' Abu al-Hasan, because I treated you and your
opponent equally?" 'Ali said, "You did not treat me and my
opponent equally, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, because you honoured
me and called me Abu al-Hasan, using my kunyah, but you did not
call my opponent by his kunyah." 'Umar kissed the head of 'Ali and
said, "May Allah not keep me in a land where Abu al-Hasan is not
there. "3zg

'I urge the one who passed wind to get up and do wudoo'.' Jareer ibn

A freed slave proposing marriage to a woman of Quraysh
'Umar (&) encouraged marriage between tribes as a means of
creating 6iendship between them, until a freed slave proposed
marriage to the sister of a man from Quraysh, and the Qurashi man
refused the offer. 'Umar intervened and said: 'What kept you from
marrying your sister to him? He is a righteous man and is bringing to
you the best of this world (wealth) and the best of the Hereafter
(piety). Give your sister in marriage to him if she agrees." So he gave
his sister to him in marriage.331

3.1.3. Respect for 'Umar in the society, and
his keenness to meet the people's needs
Respect for 'Umar in the society
'Umar had control over people's hearts and minds, and
enjoyed a position of respect which kept people's whims and desires
in check. The soundest evidence of that was when he dismissed
Khiilid ibn al-Waleed when he was at the peak of his fame and had
achieved victory in every war, and was respected and admired a great
deal. The order of his dismissal came at a time when the people were
in the greatest need of him, when they were preparing to fight the
Byzantines on the day of al-Yarmuk. Abu 'Ubaydah was appointed in
charge of the army, and Khiilid said: "We hear and obey the Ameer alMu'mineen." When one of the soldiers suggested thatfitnah might
arise as the result of this change, Khilid said, "There is no room for
fitnah so long as 'Umar is in charge."332 This is indicative of
Khilid's submission to the command of the caliph, although he was a
well-loved and successful general, but he gave up that leadership role

282

with humility the like of which has rarely been seen in the history of
militruy leadership. It is also indicative of the authority of 'Umar who
was in fn11 control of affairs.333 He was deeply respected by the
people. It was narrated that al-Hasan al-Bagi said:

'Umar ibn al-Khagb (&) heard that men were speaking about a
woman, so he sent for her. 'Umar was a man who was greatly
respected, so when the message reached her, she said, 'What does
'Umar want from me?' She went out, although she had started labour,
and when she passed by women they realized what was happening to
her. Then she produced a boy who cried once and then died. News of
that reached 'Umar, and he gathered the Muhijireen and Ansir and
consulted them. They said, '0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, you only
wanted to discipline her, and yon are in charge.' He said, 'And what
do you say, 0' So and so?' addressing a man who was at the back of
the gathering. He said, 'I say, if the people said what they said to
please you, then by Allah they have not been sincere with you. But if
that was their honest opinion, then by Allah they are wrong, 0'
Ameer al-Muinmeen.' He then said, 'I urge you to go ahead and
divide the diyah among her people.' Al-Hasan was asked, 'Who was
that man?' He answered, 'Ali ibn Abi lib."^^^
"

'Ali, 'Uthmk, Tabah, az-Zubayr, 'Abdur-Ralpnin and Sa'd
(may Allah be pleased with them all) gathered together, and 'AbdurRa!mh ibn 'Awfwas the most outspoken of them with 'Umar. They
said: "0' 'Abdur-Ralpnin, why don't you speak to Ameer aiMu'mineen concerning the people? Sometimes one who is in need
comes but his fear of 'Umar prevents him fiom speaking, and he goes
back without having his need met." So he went to him and spoke to
him about that, and he said, "0' 'Abdur-Ralgn2an, I adjure you by

with his hand as if to say, "What a bad state they will be in after you
are gone."335
It was narrated that 'Umar ibn Murrah said: "A man from
Quraysh met 'Umar and said, 'Be kind to us, for you have filled our
hearts with awe.' He asked, 'Is there any wrongdoing in that?' He
said, 'No.' He said, 'Then may Allah increase me in awe in your
hearts,' "336
'Abdull* ibn 'Abbb said: "For one year I wanted to ask
'Umar about a verse, but I could not ask him because of the awe I
felt. "337
When he saw how much the people respected him, he said:
"0' Allah, You know that I fear You more than they fear me."338

His keenness to meet people's needs
Ibn 'Abbb said: "Whenever 'Umar prayed, he would sit and
meet with the people, and whoever had some need, he would try to
help. Then he offered some prayers after which he did not sit (and
meet with people). I came to the door and asked, '0' Yda', is the
Ameer al-Mu'mineen ill?' He said, 'No.' Whilst I was like that,

camels of the booty got injured, so 'Umar (&) slaughtered it and
sent some of the meat to the wives of the Prophet

whom was al-'Abbb ibn 'Abdul-Muwb. Al-'AbbL said: "0'

prayer of the one who has been wronged, for it is answered. Only let
in those who have sheep that are few in number and weak, and keep
out the sheep of Ibn 'Awf and the sheep of Ibn 'm, for if their
sheep die, they still have their farms and date palms, but if the sheep
of one whose flocks are few in number and weak die, he will bring
his children to me and will say, '0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen,' and do
you think I am going to abandon them? Water and grass are easier for
me than gold and silver. By Allah, it is their land; they fought for it
during the JGhiliyah and now that they have become Muslim, it is still
their land. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, were it not that I
need the money to spend it for the sake of Allah, I would not have
made any himi in their land, not even a h a n d ~ ~ a n . " ~ ~ ~
It was narrated from Moosa ibn h a s ibn Mklik that Sireen the father of Muhammad ibn Sireen -asked h a s for a contract of
manumission, as he had a lot of wealth, but he refused. He went to
'Umar, who said: "Give him a contract of manumission," but he
refused. 'Umar hit him with his stick, whilst reciting the verse:
&bd such of your slaves as seek a writing [of emancipation], give
them such writing, if you find that there is good and honesty in
them.)
(Qur 'an 24: 33)
- then he gave him the contract of manumission.344

In this final story, we see a slave seeking his freedom, and a
master who refuses to give it to him, and a ruler being fair by
implementing the slave's wishes and ignoring the opinion of the
master. Where can we find the like of such an action anywhere else in
history?345

"Remove this," and he removed it. Then he said, "And (remove) this
and this..." until several stones, five or six, had been removed. Then
'Umar turned to face towards the Ka'bah and said, "Praise be to

raised in status." Milik said, "Is tbis man boasting to us when his
ancestors are in Hell?" 'Urnar got angry when 'Uyaynah objected to
this retaliation and said to him, "Be humble in Islam, for by Allah I

AI-Jarood and 'Ubayy ibn Ka'b

Al-Jarood came to 'Umar (&) and a man said: "This is the
leader of Rabee'ah." 'Umar started hitting him with his stick and
said, "I am afraid that it will affect you 0.0~1spiritual well-being)."
'Umar did the same thing with Ubayy ibn Ka'b, when he saw that the
people had gathered around him and were asking him questions after
he came out of the mosque. He said, "What you are doing is afitnah
for the leader and humiliation for the follower."348

3.1.5. His denunciation of certain behaviour in society
'Umar (&) lived his life in accordance with the wise laws of
Allah, hence he did not approve of any deviant behaviour or any
behaviour that would have a negative impact on the Muslim society.
There follow some examples of incidents in which 'Umar brought
those who were ening back to the straight path.

The slaughterhouse of az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awtm (&)
'Umar (&) used to go to the slaughterhouseof az-Zubayr ibn
al-'Awgm, which was the only one in Madeenah, carrying his stick
with him. If he saw a man buying meat for two days in a row, he
would shike him with the stick and said: "Why don't you do without
for the sake of your neighbour and cousin?"349
"Now ask for whatever you want"
'Umar (&) saw a beggar asking people (for charity), with a
sack full of foodstuff on his back. He took the food and gave it to the

"Stop walking like that"
A man came swinging his arms and strutting, and 'Umar said
to him: "Stop waking like that." He said, "I cannot." 'Umar
whipped hi,then he strutted, and he whipped him again and he
stopped strutting. 'Umar said, "If1 do not whip one like this then who
should I whip?" The man came to him after that and said, "May
Allah reward you with good; it was nothing but a Shaytcin whom
Allah sent away through you."351

"Do not make our religion dead"
'Umar saw a man who looked as ifhe was dying because ofhis
asceticism. He hit him with his stick and said: "Do not make our
religion dead, may Allah kill

some people who walked slowly and spoke slowly. She said: "Who

ibn al-Kha@b spoke, he could be heard, when he walked he walked
fast, and when he hit he caused pain, and by AUah, he was a true
ascetic."353

His concern for the people's health
The caliph 'Umar was concerned about the people's health. He
would warn them against the consequences and dangers of being fat,
and would advise them to lose weight, because that would give them
strength to strive and enable them to fulfil their duties. He used to

say: "0' people, beware of eating too much, for it makes you lazy in
prayer, is bad for your body and causes sickness. Allah hates the fat
man. Rather you should be moderate in your eating, for that is closer
to righteousness and farther removed from extravagance, and makes
one stronger to worship Allah. No person will be doomed unless he
gives precedence to his desires over his religious commitment."354
Ibn al-Jawzi stated that 'Umar (&) saw a man with a huge
belly and said: "What is this?" He said, "A blessing kom Allah." He
said, "Rather it is a punishment kom
With regard to his concern for the good health of the citizens,
he used to forbid anyone who had a stomach disease to mix with the
people, so as to prevent the spread of disease. He would advise the
sick to stay at home until they got better. And it is narrated that he
passed by a woman who had leprosy when she was on her way to the
Ka'bah. He saidto her: "0' female slave ofAllah, why don't you stay
in your home and not harm the people?" So she stayed home. Later
on a man passed by her and said, "The one who told you (not to go
out) has died, so go out." She said, "By Mah, I will not obey him
whilst he is alive and disobey him when he is dead."356
He also used to emphasize the importance of exercise, horsemanship
and horseback riding. He used to say: "Teach your children
swimming and archery, and train them to be proficient on horseback,
and teach them some beautiful poetry."357

'Umar's advice to the one who drank wine

persisted in drinking alcohol. He said to his scribe to write:
"From 'Umar ibn al-Kha6b to So and so. Peace be upon you. I
praise Allah beside Whom there is no other god. In the Name of
Allah, the most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
@I;. Meem. [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur'an, and
none but Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.] The revelation of the
Book [this Qur'an] is fiom Allah, the AU-Mighty, the All-Knower.
The Forgiver of sin, the Acceptor of repentance, the Severe in
punishment, the Bestower [of favours]. L8 il8ha illa Huwa [none has
the right to be worshipped but He], to Him is the final return.)
(Qur'an 40. 1-3)"

Then he sealed the letter and said to his messenger, "Do not give it to
him except when he is sober." Then he commanded those who were
with him to pray for his repentance. When the letter reached the man,
he started to read it and said, "My Lord has promised to forgive me,
and has warned me of His punishmenf" and he kept repeating it until
he wept. Then he gave up wine and kept away kom it. When 'Umar
heard of that he said, "This is what you should do. If you see that one
of you has slipped, correct him, pray for him and do not help the
Shaycdn against him (by insulting him, e t ~ . ) . " ~ ~ '
From this attitude we can see the genius in 'Umar's method of
disciplining people and his knowledge of human nature and the ways
of correcting people. What may benefit one person may harm
another. This is an example of successfuldiscipline and kind methods
of correction. Despite all his huge responsibilities and
preoccupations, the caliph noticed the absence of one who
regularly attended his gatherings, and he did not ignore the matter,
rather he asked about him so that he could deal with any problem that

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

291

might need dealing with. Today a man may be absent and no one
notices his brother's absence, let alone asking why he is absent and
trying to help if necessary. This carelessness is one of the factors that
has led to the collapse of Islamic brotherhood. This is not the way of
Muslims who know that they are brothers. Will anyone pay
attention? We hope so.359

'Umar's opinion on private gatherings
'Umar (&) was of the view that gatherings should be public
and open to all people regardless of any differences in status. He
disliked people having private gatherings, because that could lead to
them developing different views which may result in the emergence
of opposing factions.360
Ibn 'Ahbb narrated that 'Umar said to some of Quraysh: "I
have heard that you have gatherings. No two people should have a
private gathering so that it is said that this person is the companion of
So and so. So private gatherings should be avoided. By Allah this is
harmfnl to your religious commitment, harmful to your honour and
harmfnl to the unity between you. I can see that those who come after
you will say, 'This is the opinion of So and so,' thus dividing Islam
into factions. Make your gatherings open to everyone and sit
together, for this will cause the love between you to last and will
make you more respected among the people."36'
Indeed, when the elite keep away from the common people
and choose only certain people to sit with, this causes a lot ofbenefits
to he lost, because what is expected of the elite is that they should
guide and direct the common people. Their meeting with the people
is very beneficial, as it helps to transmit their view in an undistorted

manner, free fiom any kind of contamination. Moreover, having too
many different gatherings leads to a lot of opposing views on the
issues that are discussed. This is what 'Umar feared for his people
and for those who came a ~ e r ? ~ '

conduct in the marketplace (enjoining what
is good and forbidding what is evil)

'Umar ibn al-Khatfdb

293

Imam Abu Bakr al-Jassi& said in his commentary: "These are
the attributes of the Muhdjireen, because they are the ones who were
expelled from their homes unjustly. Allah states that if He gave them
power in the land, they would establish prayer, pay zakah, enjoin
what is good and forbid what is evil. This is a description of the
Rightly Guided Caliphs to whom AUah gave power in the land,
namely Abu Bakr, 'Umar, 'Uthmk and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased
with them)."363
History bears witness, and it is narrated via the process of
t d t u r , that 'Umar did these things in the best possible way.3MHe

was concerned with the protection and development of the
institutions of state serving the financial, judicial and military fields,
as well as matters pertaining to the appointment of governors. He
strove to make the people adhere to the command of Allah and the
commands of His Prophet Muhammad &), and he strove to make
the people avoid that which has been forbidden by Allah and by His
Prophet &), using his position as caliph of the Muslims, and
through the governors of the provinces in the Muslim state. Ibn
Taymiyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "The main aim of the
governor in any Muslim province is to enjoin what is good and forbid

against deviation, to establish worship in the Muslim society, to fight
evil, and to encourage good.

3.2.1. The concept of Tawheed and
opposing deviation and innovation
Because one of the aims of establishing an Islamic state is to
protect religion, one of the most important things that 'Umar did to
achieve this purpose was guarding the fundamentals of Islam by
making the people adhere to the pure and sound belief ('aqeedah)
with which the Messenger of Allah
had left them, and fighting
the specious arguments of deviants and the plots of the enemies of
Islam who propagated deviant beliefs and myths which the Shaytcin
made attractive to them so that they thought that they were doing
well. There follow some examples of how 'Umar guarded the
concept of Tawheed and strove against deviation:

a)

The "Brides of the Nile"

'Amr ibn al-'AS wrote to 'Umar telling him about an Egyptian
custom whereby the people threw a young girl into the river every

otherwise." He asked, "What do you mean?" They said, "When it is
the twelfth of this month, we look for a virgin girl who is still with her
parents, and we make a deal with her parents. Then we dress her in
the finest jewellery and clothes, and throw her into this Nile." ' A m
said to them, "This cannot be allowed in Islam, for Islam erases what
came before it." For a while, the Nile did not flow at all, and the
people thought of migrating. Then 'Amr wrote to 'Umar ibn alKha@b and told him of that. He wrote back saying, "You have done
the right thing. I have sent you a piece of paper in this letter; throw it
into the Nile." When his letter came, 'Amr took out the piece of
paper, on which was written: "From the slave ofAllah and Ameer alMu'mineen to the Nile of the people of Egypt. If the decision of
flowing is up to yon, then do not flow, for we have no need of you.
But if you flow by the command of Allah, the One, the Subduer, Who
is the One Who makes you flow, then we ask Allah to make you

up on Saturday, they found that Allah had caused the Nile to flow to a
depth of sixteen cubits in a single night. Thus Allah put an end to this
evil custom of the ~ ~ ~ ~ t i a n s . ~ ~ ~
'Umar explained the meaning of Tawheed in this piece of

Allah. He proved to the people the falseness of their belief, which
was deeply rooted in their hearts. Through his wise actions he
eradicated this belief from the hearts of the ~ g y p t i a n s . ~ ~ ~

Cutting down the tree of ar-Ridwin
Ibn Sa'd narrated with a saheeh isnad t?om N%' that 'Umar

and it was cut down.372
This was 'Umar's attitude in defending Tawheed and eradicating the

had never done. This was an innovation which may have led to them
worshipping that tree later on, so he ordered that it be cut

When 'Umar dismissed Khilid ibn al-Waleed from the
leadership of the army in Syria, there was no reason for that other
than the general interests of the ummah. 'Umar was afraid that the
people were too attached to Khilid and believed that victory was
connected to Khad's blessing and military expertise, and that they
would put their trust in that. He wanted them to know that Allah is the
One Who grants victory and that He does whatever He will. So he
issued his command to dismiss him, and confirmed that in a letter in
which he explained his decision, and he sent copies of this letter to all
his governors, striving to reinforce the concept of Tawheed. In this
letter he said: "I am not dismissing Khilid out of anger or betrayal,
rather the people have become confused because of him376,and I

"We follow and do not innovate"
'Umar ibn al-KhaGb said on the minbar: 'Those who follow

own opinions. They have gone astray and led others astray. But we

strove against innovation and followed the Messenger of Allah (g)
in his words and deeds. These principles form part of knowing tbe
causes ofvicto~ywhich 'Umarunderstood and lived by in this world.

3.2.2. His concern with different aspects of worship
'Umar understood kom the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of
that all issues of religion come under the heading
His Messenger (g)
of worship and religion is the way established by Allah to cover all
aspects of life and organize all its affairs, from the etiquette of eating,
drinking and relieving oneself to the establishment of the state,
rulership, financial policies, interactions, punishments and
international relations in peacetime and wartime. He understood
that the rituals of worship, such as prayer, fasting, zakah and Hajj,
have an important status, but that is not the full picture of worship,
rather that is just a part of the worship that Allah wants.386 The
implementation of this concept of worship in this world is one of the
conditions of being given power in the land. Worship also plays an
important role in people's lives by strengthening their beliefs and
establishing moral values, as well as reforming society. There follow
some examples of 'Umar's concern with the rituals of prayer, zakah,
hajj, fasting and dhikr, and his eagerness to fulfil the meanings of
worship in himself and in the Muslim society.

Prayer

a)

The Prophet
used to enjoin the Muslims to pray and he
emphatically denounced those who did not attend prayers in
congregation. Abu Bakr followed his example, and when 'Umar
became caliph he paid attention to the matter of prayer and made
them pray, and punished those who did not pray. He wrote to his

governors saying: "One of the most important issues in my view is
the prayer. Whoever prays regularly and takes care of the matter and
focuses in prayer has protected his religious commitment and is
doing well, but whoever neglects it is more likely to neglect other
religions obligations too."387
He was very keen on proper focus and humility (Mushoo 3 in
prayer. It was narrated that 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar
said: "I prayed
behind 'Umar, and I could hear his weeping from three rows
According to another report, he recited,

the Mujehideen in his prayer and would pray Qunoot for them. When
he fought the People of the Book, he would pray Qunoot against
them in the obligatory prayers?92 He would train the people and
himself to pay attention to the matter of prayer, both obligatory and
Sunnah prayers, and he would teach the people to follow the Sunnah
and warn them against innovation. When he was late for Maghnb
prayer because of something that kept him busy until the stars came
out, he freed two slaves after the prayer?93 He thought that joining

two prayers with no excuse was a major sin, and he would rebuke
those who prayed after 'R..I?~~
He would rebuke those who came late for Jumu 'ah prayer. It
was narrated from Silim ibn 'Abdullih and from 'Abdullih ibn
'Umar that whilst 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb was standing delivering the
khutbah one Friday, a man from among the earliest Muhrijireen, one
of the Companions of the Prophet @), came in. 'Umar called out to
him:"What time is it?" He said, "I was busy then I came home until I
heard the adhdn. As soon as I heard it, I did wudoo '." 'Umar said,
"Only wudoo'? I know that the Messenger of Allah (&) used to
enjoin g h ~ ~ . " 3 9 5
'Umar forbade the raising of voices in the mosque. It was
narrated that as-S2ib ibn Yazeed said: "I was standing in the mosque
and a man threw stones at me. I looked and saw 'Umar ibn alKhaeb. He said, 'Go and bring those two men to me.' So I brought
them and he said, 'Who are you (or where are you from)?' They said,
'We are from at-T2if.' He said, 'If you had been locals I would have
beaten you severely for raising your voices in the mosque of the
Messenger of Allah (g).'

'Umar used to respect the commands of the Messenger of

It was narrated that 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar said: "The
Messenger of Allah
said, ({'If the wife of any one of you asks
permission to go to the mosque, do not forbid her.',) He said, 'The
wife of 'Umar ibn al-Khatjib used to pray in the mosque and he said
to her, 'You know what I like.' She said, 'By AIlah, I will not stop

respected
the commands of shari'ah and adhered to the Book of AUah and the
Sunnah of His Messenger
because he gave precedence to that
over what he himself preferred.398

w),

'Umar loved to pray in the middle of the night, and he would
pray as much as Allah willed, then at the end of the night he would
wake his family and say, "Prayer, prayer!" and recite this verse:
(And enjoin a$-Salih [the prayer] on your family, and be patient in
offering them [i.e. the Salrih (prayers)]. We ask not of you a provision
[i.e. to give Us something: money]: We provide for you. And the
good end [i.e. Paradise] is for the Muftaqoon [the pious].),
(Qur hn 20. 1 3 2 ) ~ ~ ~
One night he prayed q i y i m and felt very distressed thinking
about the people. He could not pray and he could not go to sleep, so
he said: "By Allah, I cannot pray and I cannot sleep. I start reciting
and I do not know if I am at the beginning of the recitation or at the
end." When he was asked, "Why is that, 0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen?"
he said, "Because of my worrying about the people."400
He would make up what he missed of q i y i m al-lay1 the next
day. He narrated that the Prophet (g)said: cFA"oever missed
anything of his wird at night, and recites it between Fajr and &hr,
it will be as if he recited it at night."))401
He wished that he could be a mu hdh-dhin, and said: "If I were
able to give the adhrin as well as be the caliph, I would do so."40Z

Another of his du '6 'was: "0'Allah, if You have decreed that I

And he used to say: "I am not worried

He would encourage people to be close to those who were
obedient and he would say: "Get close to those who are obedient and

'Umar (&) loved to be reminded of Allah, and he would say
to Abu Moosa al-~sh'ari(&): "0' Abn Moosa, remind us of our

He loved to sit with the people of dhikr. It was narrated that

check in the mosque after 'Isha', and if he saw someone he would
make him leave, unless the man was standing and praying. Then he
passed by a group of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah

was closest to him, "Start makimg du 'c?'." So he made du '6 ', and he
asked them to do that, one by one, until he came to me, and I was next
to him. He said, "Come on," and I did not know what to say and I
started trembling. He said, "Speak, even if you only say, 0' Allah
forgive us, 0' Allah have mercy on us." Then 'Umar started to make
du '6' and no one shed more tears or wept more than him. Then he
said, "Now depart."408

The first one who gathered the people to pray Tarciweeh was
'Umar ibn al-Khagiib (&), and he wrote to the other regions telling
them to do likewise. The reason for that was that 'Umar came out to
the mosque one night in Ram*
and he saw the people in scattered
groups, one man praying by himself and a group of men following
one man in prayer. 'Umar said: "I think that if I unite them behind one
reader it will be better." Then he decided to unite them behind Ubayy
ibn Ka'h. The narrator, 'Abdur--in
ibn 'Abdul-Qki, said:
"Then I went out with him one night and the people were praying
behind their reader. 'Umar said, 'What a good innovation this is, but
the prayer that they sleep and miss is better than what they are doing'
- meaning at the end of the night, because the people used to pray
qiycirn at the beginning of the night."409
No one should think that Tarciweeh was introduced by 'Umar,
or that he was the fust one to introduce it. Rather it was introduced at
the time of the Prophet &), but 'Umar was the first one to unite the
people behiid a single reader, because they used to pray by
themselves, but he united them behind a single reader.410

It was narrated &om 'Urwah ibn az-Znbayr that:
"cc'kishah (I&) told him that the Messenger of Allah @) went out
one night in t6e middle of the night, and prayed in the mosque, and
some men followed his prayer. The next day the people started
talking about that, and more people gathered and prayed with him
(that night). The next day, word spread further and there were more
people in the mosque on the third night. The Messenger of Allah &)
came out and the people followed his prayer. On the fourth night,
there were so many people that the mosque could not hold them all,
but he did not come out until it was time for Fajr prayer. After he had
finished praying Fajr, he turned to the people and bore witness (that
there is no god but Allah), then he said, 'I appreciate what you did,
but I was atiaid that it may be made obligatory for you and you would
not be able to do it.' Then the Messenger of AUah &) died when that
was still the situation.^"^'^

As for 'Umar's saying, "What a good innovation this is," he
called it an innovation (bid'ah) but that was bid 'ah in the linguistic
sense, because everything that is done without precedent is called a
bid 'ah in Arabic4I3 What 'Umar did, uniting the people behind one
Imam in Tarriweeh prayer and issuing instructions to the provinces to
do the same, is indicative o f his love and keenness for organization.

Zakah, Hajj and Rama&n
'Umar was concerned with zakah and the organization of this
obligatory duty, which became one of the sources of the state's
income. We will discuss this duty when we speak of the financial
institutions insha' Allih.
With regard to Hajj, 'Umar used to do Hajj with the people
throughout his caliphate. It was said that 'Umar did Hajj for ten years
- i.e., throughout the duration of his entire caliphate - or that he
did Hajj for nine years thereof?14 Among the duties of the caliph or
those whom he appoints as his representatives in other provinces are
the following:
0:-

MMaking the people aware of the time for Hajj and going out to the
holy places

4 Teaching them the rituals according to shari'ah

O Leading the rituals of Hajj as prescribed
*

Leading them in the prayers and delivering the khucbah
prescribed in shari'ah?15

'Umar (&) encouraged the people to do Hajj and enjoined
that upon them. He said: "I thought of sending men to these regions
to see if there was anyone who could afford it but had not done Hajj,
then they could impose the j i q a h on them."416
And he strove hard to ensure that there would be people
around the Ka'bah at times other than the months of Hajj, because at
the time of Abu Bakr, the people would kequent the Ka'bah during
the months of Hajj and then forsake it for the rest of the year, and they

did not come from their regions to do 'Umrah. So the Ka'bah became
devoid of people fiom the regions throughout the year. So 'Umar
enjoined them to do that which was better for them, by doing 'Umrah
at times other than the months of Hajj. Thus the Ka'bah became
frequented and visited during the months of Hajj and during other
months. What 'Umar chose for them was better, even according to
those who say that t a m a m ' is better than @id and qirin, such as
Imam m a d and others.417It is narrated that he used to donate the
cover of the Ka'bah every year and divide it among the pilgrims.418
With regard to fasting, 'Umar followed the method of the
Messenger of Allah (B).It was proven that he broke his fast on a
cloudy day, then the sun came out and 'Umar said: "It is not serious
and we did our best to work it
When 'Umar (&) heard that a man was fasting for a lifetime
(ad-dahr
i.e., every single day), he started saying, "Eat, 0'

He used to strive very hard in worship; he prayed a great deal
and fasted a great deal, especially at the end of his life. He gave a
great deal of charity and when he became caliph he did Haji every
year. In jihad he fought alongside the Prophet &) in all the major
battles, and he fought after he died. ~e will have the reward for all the

markets and to make them do their dealings in accordance with
shari'ah. He would appoint someone else in charge of the market.
'Umar appointed as-Si'ih ibn Yazeed (&) in charge of the market of
Madeenah, and 'Ahdull& ibn 'Uthah ihn Mas'ood and others.424
The researcher will notice that the system of hisbah (checking on the
market) in the Islamic state developed in accordance with the
principles of shari'ah and developed alongside the Muslim society
until it became one of the public offices of Islam, with conditions that
must he fulfilled by the one who holds this post, conditions which
must he met by the one who is to he checked and conditions which
must he met in the types of business to he ~hecked."~
It is known that 'Umar (4)was deeply concerned with
accountability in the marketplace. He used to walk around in the
market, canying his stick with which he would discipline anyone
who deserved that. It was narrated that Anas ihn Mil& (&) said: "I
saw 'Umar wearing an izdr with fourteen patches, some of which
were of leather, and he was not wearing a shirt or cloak, he was
wearing a turban and canying his stick, walking around in the market

Imam Muslim narrated that Milik ibn Aws ibn al-Hadathin
said: "I went around in the market saying, 'Who has dirhams for
exchange?' Tabah ibn 'Ubaydull2h (&), who was with 'Umar ibn
al-KhaGb (&) said, 'Show us your gold, then come later when our
servants are here and we will give you your silver.' 'Umar ibn alKhagb
said, 'No; by Allah you will give him his silver now or
you will return his gold to him, for the Messenger of Allah &) said,
ccCSilverfor silver is riba unless it is exchanged hand to hand, gold for
gold is riba unless it is exchanged hand to hand, wheat for wheat is
riba unless it is exchanged hand to hand; barley for barley is riba
unless it is exchanged hand to hand, dates for dates is riba unless they
are exchanged hand to hand.'))'

One day 'Umar saw a man who had diluted milk with water to

'Umar prevented hoarding in the Muslim markets. He asked
Hitib ibn Abi Balta'ah: "How do you sell, 0'Hitib?" He said, "Two
mudds (for one dirham)." He said, "You go and buy (from incoming
merchants) at out gates, courtyards and markets, and you take it away
from us and sell it however you wish. Sell a sa^' (for one dirham -a
sa^' equals four mudds) - otherwise do not come to our market; go
and travel in the land and bring what you want, then sell as you
wish. "430

One day 'Umar went out to the marketplace and saw some
people hoarding because they had extra gold. 'Umar said, "Not even
for an instant. Allah sends us provision, then when it comes to our
marketplace some people hoard it because they have extra gold, and
keep it from widows and orphans, then when the importers have left,
they sell it according to what they decide. But anyone who brings
goods to the marketplace winter and summer is a guest of 'Umar; let
him sell whatever he wants and keep whatever he wants."
It was narrated that Muslim ibn Jundub said: "Some foodstuff
came to Madeenah and the people of the market went to buy it.
'Umar sald to them 'Do you want to do business in our market? Then
you must either let other people take part in this, or go out and buy it
then come and sell it.'"431
'Umar did not limit his ban to the hoarding of food for people
and animals, rather he applied that to everything by the unavailability
of which people may be harmed. M2ik narrated in al-Muwa;(a 'that
'Umar ibn al-KhaGh said: "There is to be no hoarding in our
marketplace. No rich people should hoard the provision of Allah that
has come to our market and keep it from us. But anyone who brings
goods to the marketplace winter and summer is a guest of 'Umar; let
him sell whatever he wants and keep whatever he wants."432
The texts mentioned above show that the reason for hoarding
is so that one can control the prices, which adversely affects the poor,
widows and orphans. This is clear fiom what 'Umar said to Hitib ibn
Abi Balta'ah -who used to sell two mudds for one dirham: "You go
and buy (from incoming merchants) at out gates, courtyards and
markets, and you take it away from us and sell it however you wish.
Sell a sa^' (for one dirham -a si ' equals four mudds)." And he said

to the people in the marketplace who hoarded goods: "Allah sends us
provision, then when it comes to our marketplace some people hoard
it because they have extra gold, and keep it kom widows and
orphans, then when the importers have left, they sell it according to
what they decide." He rebuked them sternly for that.433

'Umar would intervene to impose a suitable price for essential
commodities, when such intervention was necessary to protect the
consumers and merchants. A man brought some olive oil which he
began to sell in the market for a price other than that which people
usually paid. 'Umar said to him: "Either sell it at the market price or
leave our market, for we will not force you to stick to a price." And
he made him leave.434

Obliging merchants to k n m what is

halt1 and harim in buying and selling
'Umar (&) would beat with his stick anyone who sat in the
market and did not know the rulings. He said: "No one should sit in
our market who does not know what nba is."435 He would walk
around in the market and hit some merchants with his stick and say:
"NO one who should sell in our marketplace except one who has
understanding of the d e s of Islam, otherwise he is going to consume
riba whether he wants to or not."436
No aspect of running the state took more of 'Umar's attention
at the expense of another, for the ruler should not lose balance. 'Umar
set out guidelines for the merchants which were suited to the market,
to regulate exchanges and guarantee stability in the market. There

were to he no bad deals, cheating or hoarding, no black market and
no ignorance of what is and is not permitted in the world of trade. He
issued a brief and comprehensive decree that put an end to all
corruption and regulated everything: "Whoever does not have an
understanding of the rules of Islam should not deal in our market."437
This is akin to the issuing of laws nowadays, such as the rule
that no one should undertake a certain job unless he has a certificate
or licence in such and such a field.438States nowadays organize and
supervise the markets by setting up chambers of commerce and the
like to regulate the marketplace and put the public's mind at rest.
'Umar had the distinction of being the first to do that; he did not leave
the marketplace m chaos, rather he appointed supervisors to watch
over it and keep it in order. He appointed SulaymSm ihn Hathamah in
charge of the markets; he appointed as-S2ib ihn Yazeed as his agent
in charge of the market of Madeenah, along with 'Ahdull& ihn
'Uthah ibn Mas'ood. So there was a supervisor in charge of all
markets, then each market had its own supervisor. It is certain that
this attention to the organization of markets played a great role in
relieving people of a great deal of hardship in getting what they
needed. If the ruler pays due attention to this matter, he will he
rewarded by Allah. 'Umar's good actions prove that Islam is suited to
all times and all places throughout the world; it motivates backward
nations to advance and keeps advanced nations &om declining and
collapsing. It does not block the way for those who want to advance
and it does not leave the negligent to get carried away in their
negligence.439

'Umar commands the people to work hard
and encourages them to earn a living
'Umar used to urge the people to work hard and earn a living.
It was narrated from Muhammad ibn Sireen that his father said: 'I
attended Maghrib with 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b. He came to me and I
had a small pile of clothes. He asked, 'What is this you have?' I said,
'Some clothes. I come to this market and buy and sell.' He said, '0'
Quraysh, do not let this one and others like him conk01 trade, for it is
one-third of leadership.' "
It was also narrated that al-Hasan said that 'Umar said:
"Whoever tries to trade in something three times and cannot make
any money out of it, let him move on to something else."440
'Umar said: "Learn a profession, for soon one of you will need a
profession." 441
And he said: "Were it not for this buying and selling, you would soon
become dependent on people."442
And he said: ''Earning in which there is some menial work is better
than begging from people."443
And he said: "If one of you wants to buy a camel, let him choose one
that is big and fat. Then ifhe does not benefit from it, he can still sell
it and make a profit."
And he said: "0' poor people, lift up your heads and engage in bade,
for the way is clear, and do not be dependent on people."444
And he also said: "No one of you should refraim from earning a living
and say, '0' Allah grant me provision,' when he knows that the sky

through the land, and seek the Bounty of Allah [by working], and
remember Allah much, that you may be successful.8
(@rZan 62:

he have a skill?" If the answer was no, he would say, "I am no longer
impressed."446And he said: "There is no situation in which I would
Like to die, apart kom jihad for the sake of Allah, more than if death
were to come to me when I was travelling with my camels (for the
purpose of trade), seeking provision by the bounty of Allah." And he
recited the verse:

'Umar's fear that prominent Muslims
would give up trading
'Umar ibn al-Khatjiib (&) entered the marketplace dnring his
caliphate and he saw that the majority of traders were Nabataeans.
This upset him,so when be had gathered the people together he told
them about that and rebuked them for abandoning the market. They
said: "Allah has made us independent of the market by means of the
conquests that He has granted to us." 'Umar (&) said: "By AUah, if
you carry on like that, your men will need their men and your women
will need their women."448 'Umar regarded the prominent Muslims'

3.2.4. 'Umafs night patrols
There can be no doubt that the night patrols (al- 'mas)formed
the basis for the police. Some historians have stated that 'Abdullih
ibn Mas'ood (4)
was in charge of the night patrols at the time of
Abu Bakr, and that 'Umar ibn al-Khat&b took charge of the night
patrols himself. He used to bring his keed slave Aslam with him, and
sometimes he would bring 'Abdur-ibn 'Awf with him. Night
patrols refers to going around at night and keeping a lookout for
thieves and evildoers and others whose evil is feared. We should
rightfully regard this as the first step in the establishment of the police
force, because the believers used to guard themselves and prevent
evil amongst themselves during the day, then when they went to sleep
the night patrol took over the task of guarding them. Then when the
numbers of evildoers increased and they began to commit evil openly
in broad daylight, there was a need for guards to keep a lookout
during the day too, so the police force was established as a permanent
'Umar himself used to guard the Muslims, and that helped
keep him up to date with what was happening in the Muslim society.

him) - which at that time was the capital of the Islamic state, a
meeting place for all peoples and the seat of govemment -he would
walk in the streets at night
- to see and hear for himself what his agents
might hesitate to tell him or what they might fail to pass on to him.

situation. There follow some examples which point to what we have
menti~ned.~~'
Prohibition on hastening to wean infants
It was narrated that Aslam, the £reed slave of 'Umar ibn alKhasb (&) said: "Some merchants came to Madeenah and camped
in the prayer-place. 'Umar said to 'Abdur-Ralpn%n ibn 'Awf, 'Shall
we go and guard them tonight?' He said, 'Yes.' So they guarded them
overnight. They prayed and 'Umar heard a child crying. He went
towards him and said to his mother, 'Fear Allah and look after your
child.' Then he went back to his place. At the end of the night, he
heard the child crying again, so he went to his mother and said to her,
'Woe to you, what a bad mother you are! Why has your child not
stopped crying all night?' She said, '0'slave of AUah, I am
distracting him from nursing but he refuses to accept that.' He said,
'Why?' She said, 'Because 'Umar does not give a stipend except to
children who are weaned.' 'Umar had allocated a stipend to every
child who was weaned. He said, 'How old is this son of yours?' She
said, 'So many months.' He said, 'Woe to you, do not hasten to wean
him.' When he prayed Fajr, the people could not hear his recitation
clearly because of his weeping. He said, 'Woe to 'Umar, how many
of the Muslims' children has he killed?' Then he ordered a caller to
cry out: 'Do not hasten to wean your children, for we will give a
stipend to every child born m Islam,' and he wrote instructions to that
effect to all regions."45z
What a beautiful story this is, and how great was his justice.
Thus every newborn was recorded in the state records and allocated a
stipend &omthe bayt al-mil of the Muslims, because the bayt al-mil
belongs to all the Muslims, and the one who is in charge of it is a

318

trustee and it is not permissible for him to dispose of any of it
unlawfully or to withhold anything from one who is entitled to it.

Setting a limit on how long soldiers
can be away from their wives
One of the results of 'Umar's night patrols was that he went
out one night to patrol Madeenah and he heard a woman in great
distress saying in verse:
"This night is too long and I cannot go to sleep for I have no one to
sleep with,
By Allah, were it not for AUah I would have made this bed
shake."453
'Umar said: 'Way Allah have mercy on you." Then he sent her
some clothing and money, and wrote a letter telling her husband to
come to her.454
According to another report: Then he went and knocked on his
daughter Hafsah's door. She said: "0'Ameer al-Mu'mineen, what
brings you here at this hour?" He said, "0' my daughter, how long
can a woman put up with her husband being away?" She said, "She
can put up with a month or two or three, but in the fourth month she
will lose patience." 'Umar wrote that the soldiers should not be kept
away for more than four months.455This was how 'Umar set a limit
on how long a soldier could be away kom his Gfe, and no one
disputed with him concerning that.456
As for the soldiers who did not adhere to this limit, 'Umar
checked on them before setting a limit. After he found out the names

of those who had been away for a long time and had not sent any
maintenance to their families during their absence, he wrote to their
commanders asking them to give them the following options: they
were either to return to their wives, or send them sufficient
maintenance, or divorce them, but if they divorced them they were
obliged to send maintenance to cover the past period.457

Protecting the honour of the Mujlihideen
Another result of 'Umar's checking on the people at night was
that he protected the honour of the Mujihideen. He went out one
night and walked around Madeenah, and he heard some lines of
poetry which contained something dubious. In the middle of the
night, a woman was expressing her wish for wine and the company of
a handsome young man for whom she had always longed, whether
that was a real wish and she meant it, or said it simply as poetry
without meaning it. Whatever the case, the words appeared dubious.
She started to say lines such as:
"Is there any way to get some wine and drink it?
Is there any way to reach Nasr ibn Hajjij?"
After hearing this, 'Umar sent for N q r ibn Hajjij the following
morning, and saw that he was the most handsome of people, with
splendid hair. He ordered that his hair be shaved off, but that only
made him more handsome. He ordered him to wear a turban, but that
~"
only made him more handsome. So he expelled him to ~ a ~ r a ,lest
women be tempted by him, and so as to block the means of
temptation and protect the honour of the soldiers who were guarding
the border for the sake of Allah. This action of 'Umar's shows the
farsightedness of his public policies and his wisdom in giving
precedence to the public interest. The fact that Nav was so

320

Abu Bahr S appointment of 'Umar as his successor

handsome, and that the soldiers were away from their wives, and that
people felt at ease and secure in Madeenah, could have led tofitnah,
so it was better for this spoiled youth to be sent to a military town
where he could gain experience in fighting or benefit from seeing the
heroic actions of real men. Basra -which was a militiuy town at that
time - was the best remedy for such a youth.459
The woman whom 'Umar had heard was a h i d that he might
rebuke her, so she sent him some lines of verse in which she said:
"Tell the Imam who is respected and feared: what do I need of wine
and N q r ibn Hajjgj?
I was referring to Abu Hafs by mentioning someone else. And all I
wanted was to drink milk and relax..."
'Umar sent word to her saying: "I have heard something good
about you. I did not expel him (Nasr) because of you, rather I heard
that he enters upon women and I cannot trust them."460 Then 'Umar
wrote a letter to his governor in Basra, and the messenger stayed
there for several days, then a caller cried out, "The mail of the
Muslims is going to leave, so whoever wants to send a letter, let h i
write it." Nasr ibn Hajjgj wrote a letter m which he said: "In the name
of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, for the slave of Allah
'Umar, the Ameer al-Mu'mineen..." then he wrote some lines of
verse in which he questioned why he had been expelled because of a
woman saying some silly things. 'Umar said: "So long as I am the
ruler, he may not retum." So he did not retum to Madeenah until after
'Umar died.461
There is a similar story in which 'Umar went on his night
patrol around Madeenah and heard some women talking and

"'

wondering which young man in Madeenah was most handsome. One
of them said: "Abu Dhu'ayb." 'Umar looked for him and found that
he was one of the most handsome of people. He said to him, "Rather
you are a wolf (dhi'b)for them. Go and never stay in the same city as
me." The young man said: "If you are going to do that, then let me
join my cousin Nasr ibn al-Hajj%." They were both from Banu
Sulaym, and 'Umar let him join his cousin.462
This action of 'Umar's was dictated by the situation of the
ummah, and is consistent with his strong inclination to make the most
of individual potentials. 'Umar's era was one in which the armies
were mobilized and all those who were able for it were sent to fight
for the sake of Allah, so how could 'Umar hear of these two young
men who were in Madeenah although there was no reason why they
should not go and fight. Expelling them kom Madeenah was better
than leaving them to compose poems and sit with women.463

"Willyou carry my burden for me
on the Day of Resurrection?"
It was narrated that Aslam the freed slave of 'Umar (&) said:
" 'Umar went out to Harrat
and I went with him. When we
were in
we saw a fire burning. He said, '0' Aslam, I see
here some travellers who are being held up by the night and the cold;
let's go.' So we went running and when we came near to them, we
saw a woman with children. There was a pot set up over the fire, and
her children were crying. 'Umar said, 'Peace be upon you, 0' people
of the light @e did not want to say, 0' people of the fire).' She said,

'And upon you be peace.' He said, 'May I come closer?' She said,
'Come if you can do some good, otherwise leave us alone.' He came
closer and said, 'What is the matter with you?' She said, 'The night
and the cold held us up.' He said, 'What is the matter with these
children; why are they crying?' She said, 'They are hungry.' He said,
'What is in this pot?' She said, 'Water, to calm them down until they
go to sleep, and Allah will judge between us and 'Umar.' He said,
'May Allah have mercy on you, how could 'Umar know about you?'
She said, 'How come he is in charge of our affairs, but he is not aware
of our situation?' He turned to me and said, 'Let's go.' So we set off
running until we came to the room where wheat was stored. He took
out a sack of wheat and a little fat, and said, 'Hoist it up onto me.' I
said, 'I will carry it for you.' He said, 'Will you carry my burden for
me on the Day of Resurrection, may you be bereft of your mother?'
So I hoisted it up onto him and he set out running and I ran with him.
When he reached her, he put those things down. He took out some of
the wheat and said to her, 'Prepare it for me and I will cook it for
yon.' He started blowing beneath the pot and I saw the smoke coming
out through his beard. He cooked it for her, and brought it to her, and
said, 'Bring me something.' So she brought him a vessel and he
poured it into it, then said, 'Feed them and I will spread it out (to cool
down) for them.' He stayed until they had eaten their fill, and he left
the leftover food with her. He got up, and I got up with him, and she
started to say, 'May Allah reward you with good; you are more suited
to be the caliph thanAmeer al-Mu'mineen.' He said, 'Say something
good, and if you go to the Ameer al-Mu'mineen, you will find me
there insha 'Allih -Allah willing." Then he walked some distance
away from her, then turned to face them again and waited a while. I
said to him, 'Is there anythhg else?' but he did not answer me, until I
saw the boys wrestling then falling asleep, having calmed down.
Then he stood up and said, 'Praise be to Allah, the Exalted, the
Almighty.' Then he tuned to me and said, '0' Aslam, hunger kept

"0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, give your
companion the glad tidings of a boy"
Whilst 'Umar was patrolling one night, he passed by one of the
courtyards of Madeenah and saw a tent that had not been there the
night before. He drew closer and heard the cries of a woman in
labour. He saw a man sitting there, so he went to him and greeted him
with salim, and asked: "Who are you?" He said, "I am one of the
people of the desert, and I have come to Ameer al-Mu 'mineento get a
share of his bounty." He then asked, "What is this noise I can hear
inside the tent?" He said, "May Allah have mercy on you, it is not
your concern." He said, 'Wever mind tell me what it is." He said, "A
woman in labour." He asked, "Is there anyone with her?" He said,
"No." So 'Umar went to his home and said to his wife Umm
Knlthoom bint 'Ali, "Do you want some reward that Allah has made
easy for you?" She asked, "What is it?" He said, "A woman who is a
stranger and is in labour, and has no one with her." She said, 'Yes, if
you wish." He said, "Take with you whatever women need for giving
birth of cloths and creams, and bring me a pot and some fat and
grains." She brought those things, and he said, "Let's go." He carried
the pot and she walked behind him until they reached the tent. He
said to her, "Go in to the woman," and he went and sat with the man
and said to him, "Light a fire for me." He did that, and he put the pot
on the fire until the food was cooked. The woman gave birth and
'Umar's wife said, "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, give your companion
the glad tidings of a boy." When the Bedouin heard the words Ameer
al-Mu'mineen it was as if he got scared and he started to back away.
'Umar said to him, "Stay where you are." He took the pot and placed

it by the door and said (to his wife), "Let her eat her fill." So she did
that, then she brought the pot out and placed it by the door, and
'Umar got up and took it and placed it in front of the man and said,
"Eat, woe to you! You have stayed up all night." And he said to his

we will give you what you need." The next day he came to him and
he gave a stipend to his son, like any other Muslim

"By Allah I will not obey him in public
and disobey him in private"
It was narrated that Aslam, the freed slave of 'Umar (&),
said: "Whilst I was with 'Umar ibn al-Khasb as he was patrolling
Madeenah, he got tired and leaned against a wall in the middle of the
night. He heard a woman saying to her daughter: "0' my daughter,
get up and mix that milk with water." She said, "0' my mother, what
about the decree of the Ameer al-Mu'mineen?" She said, "What was
his decree?" She said, "He commanded his caller to cry out: Do not
dilute milk with water." She said to her, "0' my daughter, get up and
dilute that milk with water, for you are in a place whether neither
'Umarnor his caller can see you." The girl said, "By Allah, I will not
obey him in public and disobey him in private." 'Umar heard all of
that, then be said, "0' Aslam, mark the door and remember where it
is." Then he carried on with his patrol. The next day, he said, "0'
Aslam, go to that place and see who said that and who she said it to,
and whether they have a husband." He went to that place and found a
single girl with no husband, and the other woman was her mother
who had no man. He came to 'Umar and told him, and 'Umar called
his sons together and said, "Does any one of you need a woman to
many? If your father had any energy none of you would beat him to
this girl." 'Abdullih said, "I have a wife." ' A b d u r - R m said, "I

have a wife." '&im said, "0' my father, I do not have a wife, so let
me many her." He sent for the girl and married her to 'ASim. She
bore him a daughter, and that daughter bore a daughter, and that
granddaughter bore 'Umar ibn al-'Azeez (may AUah have mercy on
'

Ibn 'Abdul-HSdi said: "Some of them said that this is how it is
narrated in this report, but it is a mistake. The correct version is: 'She
bore 'Asim a daughter, and the daughter bore 'Umar ibn 'Abdul'Azeez (may Allah have mercy on him).' "469
'Umar used to check on the people himself, and he would
patrol at night and fulfil his duty towards the people, seeking the
reward thereof with Allah. His keenness to keep up to date with
affairs in his state was not limited to the capital only, rather that
concern extended to all regions of the Islamic state, as we shall see in
the following pages insha' AEh.

3.2.5. His kindness and compassion towards animals
'Umar's kindness towards animals stemmed fiom his faith
which made him kind and compassionate towards everything. His
heart had been softened by the remembrance of Allah (dhikr) and he
felt compassion towards all of Allah's creation. He learned from
Islam that in every living being there is reward, and that it is not
permissible in Islam to abuse animals, to destroy them for no reason,
to use them in ways for which they were not created or to force them
to do more than they are
'Umar (&) declared that if a mule
stumbled in Iraq, he was responsible for not having the road paved.

"Will you burden your camel with more than it can bear?"
It was narrated that al-Musayyib ibn Dirim said: "I saw 'Umar
ibn al-KhatJib (&) beating a camel driver and saying, 'Will you
burden your camel with more than it can bear?'"471

"Do you not k n m that they have rights over you?"
Al-Alpaf ibn Qays said: "We came to 'Umar with news of a
great conquest, and he asked, 'Where are you staying?' I said, 'In
such and such a place.' He came with me until we reached the place
where the animals were resting, and he checked them over and asked,
'Will you not fear Allah with regard to these mounts of yours? Do
you not kuow that they have rights over you? Why did you not let
them loose so that they could eat of the vegetation of the earth?' "472

Treating the za!d camels
A delegation from Iraq, among whom was a l - m i b n Qays,
came to 'Umar on a very hot summer's day. 'Umar had wrapped an
abayah around his head l i e a turban and was daubing one of the
zakah camels with pitch (as a remedy). He said: "0' &af, take off
your cloak and come and help the Ameer al-Mu'mineen with this
camel, for it is one of the zakah camels and it has the same rights as
the widows, the orphans and the poor." A man said, 'Way Allah
forgive you, 0' Amew al-Mu 'mineen, why don't you tell one of the
zakah slaves to do that for you?" 'Umar said, "What slave is more of
a slave than me or al-&af? The one who is appointed in charge of
the Muslims has the same duty towards them as a slave to his master,
the duty of sincerity and fulfilling the trust."473

"An animal has been made to suffer because of 'Umar's wishes"
'Umar wanted some fresh fish, so Yarfa' -his freed slave took a camel and travelled two days there and two days back to buy
some fish and bring it to him. Yarfa' went and washed the sweat from
his mount. 'Umar looked at it and said, "An animal has been made to
suffer because of 'Umar's wishes. By Allah, 'Umar will never taste
that (fish)."474

"I am afraid that I will be questioned about you"
'Umar saw a camel which appeared exhausted and sick. He
went to if laid his hand on the camel's back and examined it, saying,
"I am afraid that I will be questioned about you (i.e., on the Day of
~esurrection)."~~~
These are some stories of 'Umar which demonstrate his
kindness and compassion towards animals. Would that our confused
youth would learn about their history and about Islam, so that they
would know that there is no humane principle that benefits human
society but Islam has enjoined it and explained it in detail; then they
would not be dazzled by the west which boasts of its animal welfare
societies as being one of the signs of its humane principles, and our
youth would not imitate the west t h i n g that they invented such
things. They should realize that we taught the west everything it
knows about kindness to animals476and everything that is beneficial.

(s)

Remembering that AUah
is always watching is the key to
guidance and goodness and is the essence of worship. Even with
regard to a sick camel, 'Umar feared that his Lord would question
him about it. This is the essence of Islam, awareness of Allah's

watching and fear of Him that stills the heart. Can any ruler succeed
without this, can he escape the reckoning of Allah when he has been
appointed in charge of His slaves?477

3.2.6. Earthquake during the time of 'Umar
There was an earthquake at the time of 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb,
and he said: "0' people, this earthquake is only because of some sins
that you are committing. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, if it

4. 'Umar's Concern for Knowledge,
the DZ'iyahs and the Scholars
4.1. 'Umar's concern for knowledge
Knowledge is one of the most important factors for the Muslim
ummah to prevail, because it is impossible to imagine that Allah
would support an ignorant nation which does not seek knowledge.
Anyone who studies the Holy Qur'an will realize that it is filled with
verses that give knowledge a high status and encourages us to seek it
and acquire it. The first verse of the Book of Allah which enjoins
knowledge and reading is:
dRead! In the Name of your Lord Who has created [all that exists].)
(Qur'an 96: 1)

477

Op. cit., p. 229.
478 Farri'id al-Kalrim, p. 140: quoting from ad-Dri' wa ad-Dawri' b y ibn alQayyim, p. 53.

'Umar ibn al-Khanrib

329

The Qur'an also describes knowledge as the opposite of hj?,
which is ignorance and misguidance. Allah (&) says:
(Say, 'Are those who know equal to those who know not?' It is only
men of understanding who will remember [i.e. get a lesson from
(Qur'an 39: 9)
Allah's Signs and Verses].)
The only thing that Allah commanded His Prophet to ask for
more of was knowledge479,as He ( B )says:
(... And say, 'My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.')r
(Qur'an 20. 114)

The Sahribah understood that knowledge and understanding of
religion are among the means of attainmg divine help and support.
Hence they were keen to understand their religion and to learn the
word of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. Their pursuit of
knowledge was for the sake of Allah. They were also keen to learn
the evidence for rulings, and they were certain that it is essential to
act upon one's knowledge, otherwise Allah would take away the
blessing fiom it. The Sahribah learned from the Messenger of Allah
&) his du '6 ': ((''0'AUah, I seek refuge with You from knowledge
that is of no benefit, fiom a heart that is not humble, from a soul that
is never satisfied and from a prayer that is not answered."))480
The nmmah bore witness to 'Umar's great knowledge and the
fact that he was one of thefaqeehs of the earliest generation, without
parallel. He was known for the depth of his knowledge, his analytical
ability and his brilliance in reaching the right conclusions. This after the help and guidance of Allah - qualified him for that
prominent position. Thus 'Umar became the faqeeh of the Muslims
after he became caliph, and through his ijtihad he established the

principles ofjustice based on the core teachings of Islam. 'Umar was
one of the foremostfaqeehs of the Sahiibah, and the righteous salaf
praised his knowledge and understanding, and his precise knowledge
of shar'i rulings. 'Umar (&) was cautious in accepting ahrideeth
and he discussed various issues of knowledge with the Sahiibah. He
would ask the Sahibah about matters that he had not learned &om the

and would check on people to encourage them to learn. He made
Madeenah a centre of fiqh andfatwas, and it became a school &om
which governors and judges graduated. He prepared a select group of
the Sahiibah to lead institutes of learning (the mosques) in the
conquered regions, where they taught and educated the conquered
peoples in accordance with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His
Messenger
Thus he laid the foundations for the schools which
had such an effect on the Muslim peoples, such as the schools of
Basra, Koofah and Damascus, and he fuaher developed the schools
of Madeenah and Makkah.

4.1.1. His caution in accepting ahlideeth and his
discussions of knowledge and asking about
matters of which he was unaware
His caution in accepting m d e e t h and seeking cunjrmation
Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari asked for permission to enter the place
of 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb, but he did not let him in - as if he was
busy - so Abu Moosa went away. 'Umar finished what he was
doing and asked: "Did I not hear the voice of 'Abdullih ibn Qays?
Let him in." It was said, "He has gone back." So he called him and
he (Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari) said, "We were commanded to do that."
He asked, "Can you bring me proof of that?" So he went to a
gathering of the Ansir and asked them, and they said, "No one will
testify about that for you but the youngest of us." Abu Sa'eed stood

up and said, "We were commanded to do that." 'Urnar said, "I did not
learn of that from the Messenger of Allah @). I was too busy in the
markets," i.e., going out for trade.481
According to the report narrated by Abu Sa'eed al-Khudn, he
said: "I was in a gathering of the An@ when Abu Moosa came,
looking womed, and said, 'I asked permission to meet 'Umar three
times and he did not let me in, so I went away. He asked me what
stopped me and I said, 'I asked permission to enter and meet you
three times and I was not admitted so I went away, and the Messenger
said, (('If any one of you asks permission to enter three
of Allah
times and he is not admitted, let him go away.',, And he said, 'You
have to bring me proof of that.' Is there anyone among you who
heard that from the Prophet
Ubayy ihn Ka'h said, 'By Allah,

youngest of the people, so I went with him and told 'Umar that the

It was narrated that: " 'Umar was asked about a man who

should not pray until he finds water.' 'Ammk said to him, c('0'

riding camels and we became junub? As for me, I rolled on the
ground like an animal, and as for you, you did not pray. I told the

you to do this,'485and he struck the ground with his hands and wiped
his face and hands.')) 'Umar said to him, 'Fear Allah, 0' 'Ammk.'
He said, 'If you wish, I will not speak of it.' He said, 'No, we accept
what you say.' This was a Sunnah that 'Umar had witnessed but then

'Umar said: "No man is a scholar until he does not envy those

and does not take any payment for his work."
And he said: "Acquire knowledge before you become leaders and
pride prevents you from learning and you live in ignorance."488
And he said: "Even if knowledge does not benefit you, it will never
harm
And he said: "The death of a thousand worshippers is easier to bear
than the death of a scholar who has knowledge of what Allah has
permitted and forbidden."490
And he said: "Be vessels of the Qur'an (i.e., learn it by heart) and
founts of knowledge, and ask Allah for provision day by day, and it
will not harm you if He does not give you a lot."491
And he also said: "Seek knowledge and teach it to people. Learn
dignity and tranquillity, and be humble towards those from whom
you lean knowledge and be humble towards those to whom you
teach it, and do not be tyrannical scholars otherwise your knowledge
cannot be established because of your tyranny.."492
'Umar warned against the mistakes of scholars and said:

of the hypocrites who mismterpret the Qur'an to support their views

4.1.3. Persisting in guiding and
educating people in Madeenah
'Umar persisted in guiding and educating the people through
daily contact, especially on Fridays when the Jumu 'ah khucbah from
the minbar played an important role in teaching and guiding the
ummah. History has recorded many of 'Umar's sermons, and we will
quote some of them below.
'Umar delivered a khucbah from the minbar of the Messenger
and said: "When the prohibition of khamr (wine,
of Allah
alcohol) came, khamr was made from five things: grapes, dates,
wheat, barley and honey. But khamr is anythiug that befogs
(kh6mara) the mind. There are three things which I wish the
Messenger of Allah &J had not left us before settling the matter:
how much a grandfather may inherit (from his grandson), the
inheritance of al-ka161ah494and some types of rib^.^^^

a)

He delivered a khu$bah one Friday in which he advised the
people and explained their rights over him. He said: "0'
some greed is poverty and some despair is richness. You amass that
which you do not consume and you hope for that which you can
never have. You have been given a respite in this world. At the time
of the Messenger of Allah @) you were checked by means of the
wahy (revelation), and whoever hid something was brought to
account and whoever did something openly was brought to account.
Show us the best of your behaviour, and Allah knows what is in your
hearts. If someone shows us one thing but claims that he is good in
his heart, we will not believe him. If he shows us that he is outwardly
good, we will think well of him. Remember that stinginess is one of
there is no father or son.

B... And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness, such are
(Qur'an 59: 9)
they who will be the successfd.b
0' people, pay attention to the Hereafter and set your affairs straight;
fear Allah your Lord, and do not dress your women in qubriti
garments, for although they are not see-through, they still show the
shape. 0' people, I wish that I would be saved by a small margin, and
I hope that if I live among you for a short time or a long time, I will do
the right thing by you insha' Allrih, so that each of the Muslims will
continue to receive his nght and his share of the wealth of Allah even
if he stays in his house. Take care of the wealth that Allah has
bestowed upon you. A little provision acquired with kindness is
better than a lot acquired through violence. Being killed is a way of
death that could befall righteous and evildoers alike, and the martyr is
the one who devotes himself for the sake of Allah. If any one of you
wants to acquire a camel, let him choose one that is tall and big and
strike it with his stick; if it does not flinch then let him buy it."496

Great wisdom in a khutbuh
'Umar opened his khutbah with words of great wisdom, in
which he explained that true richness comes with contentment and
that true poverty comes with greed. The basis of contentment is
showing no interest in what other people have. Whoever shows no
interest in what others have will be content with what he has, and
whoever is content with what he has is rich even if he is poor.
Whoever is controlled by greed and looks at what others have will
feel that he is poor even if he has a great deal of wealth, because his
wealth is not making him feel independent. Richness is richness of

the heart, and common sense dictates that a person should not acquire
more than he needs of worldly wealth, and his worldly ambitions
should not be attached to that which he does not possess; he should
regard this world as something transient and not be deceived by its
attractions and temptations?97
Judge people as they appear to be and do not
be concerned with their inward nature
This khucbah established the principle of dealing with people
after the cessation of revelation, namely judging people as they
appear to be and not being concerned with their inward nature,
leaving that to Allah. This indicates that the ruler is not responsible
for judging what is in people's hearts, for he can never do that; rather
he is responsible for correcting their outward behaviour, because if
the outward behaviour is correct, a righteous society may be
established. Society can be judged to be sound if it appears to be
sound and immorality is not committed in public and there are no
people who openly commit immorality or defend it, even if there are
individuals who may be inwardly evil, because what is apparent fiom
the outward customs of society is consistent with the goals of that
society. As for what is hidden of deviation, even though social
customs reject it, those who engage in it will be forced to the fiinges
of society.
Some stinginess is a branch of hypocrisy
The words "Remember that some stinginess is a branch of
hypocrisy" clearly refer to those who fall short in spending for the
being
sake of Allah. They see some states and groups of their -ah
attacked by the hffir, their honour being violated and the resources
of their lands being plundered, but when those who are being

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

337

attacked rise to fight in jihad, they only find a few Muslims who are
willing to help them with their wealth. Those believers who are
afflicted with the disease of miserliness are behaving somewhat like
the hypocrites, which is a sign of weakness of faith?98

"1 hope that I could be saved by a small margin"
This is indicative of 'Umar's sensitive feelings and clear
understanding of his responsibility, for being in a position of
leadership is one of the highest acts of righteousness, but there are
many dangers which may turn it into the worst of deeds. Many
leaders have been raised in status before Allah and before the
righteous people because of their deeds, because they have checked
themselves in all matters, minor and major. But many others have
done the opposite because they gave priority to their whims and
desires and gave precedence to pleasing the people rather than
pleasing Allah. 'Umar
was one of the greatest leaders in history,
one of those who embodied justice in its most eloquent form, yet
despite that he spoke these words; his deep fear of Allah made him
forget the reward he had earned for his actions as ruler, in the hope
that he would emerge pure and kee of any sin he may have picked up
during his

'Umar
said: 'Whoever conceals his secrets will have the
choice (of telling whomever he wants to tell), but whoever speaks or
acts in a suspicious manner should not blame anyone who t h i s
badly of him. Do not think badly of a word spoken by your brother
when you can still fmd good ways to interpret it. Think positively of

your brother until you are certain that he is not like that. Do not swear
a great deal lest Allah humiliate you. There is no better reward for
one who disobeys Allah concerning you than your obeying Allah
concerning him. You should seek sincere friends and maintain good
relations with them, for they are a pleasure at times of ease and a
support at times of calamity.."500
These are eloquent words which from which we may learn a
great deal. There follows a brief commentary on these words.

Whoever conceals his secrets will have the choice
A man will remain in control of his affiim so long as he
conceals his secrets. If he discloses his secret to one or more people,
then realizes that it would have been better not to disclose it, he
cannot reverse the situation.

But whoever speaks or acts in a suspiciuus manner
should not blame anyone who thinks badly of him
Each person is responsible for himself before other people. He
should try to keep his name clear and explain himself as much as he
can. If he thinks that some people have misunderstood his behaviour,
he should hasten to explain, even if he is trusted by everyone and has
a high standing in society. The Prophet &J said to the two men who
saw him walking with a woman at night, "Wait a minute, she is
Safiyyah bint ~ u ~"'01 a ~ ~ .

others. Thinking well of fellow-Muslims is something that is required

of the Muslim, and trying to find the best way to interpret words that
appear bad, unless he finds out that these words are in fact pure evil,
is also something that is required of the Muslim, who should at the
same time take precautions for himself and for those who are under
his care, lest they be caught unawares?0z

Do not swear a great deal lest Allah humiliate you
Swearing by Allah (&) is an act of veneration. If it is done
according to need and in an attitude of veneration and fear of Allah,
then it is an afljrmahon of His greatness, but if a Muslim swears by
Allah a great deal, even concerning trivial matters, then this will
never be an act of veneration of Allah, rather it will come under the
heading of disrespect and carelessness. In consequence, the one who
swears a great deal by Allah will expose himselfto Allah's humiliation
of him, and whoever exposes himself to that loses a great deal.

There is no better reward for one who disobeys Allah
concerning you than your obeying Allah concerning him
If there is a disagreement between you and another person, and
he disobeys Allah concerning you, either by being aggressive
towards you or by violating your honour or taking your wealth, the
best manner in which can you requite him is by obeying Allah
concerning him, by adhering to the Islamic etiquette of disagreement
and respecting the rights of your Muslim brother and not s i h n g to
his level or responding in kind. Then if you forgive him and yield
your rights, that is perfect obedience to Allah.

You should seek sincere fiends
Yes, you may have a brother who was not bome by the same
mother; sincere brothers whose hearts come together on the path of

Abu Bakr k appoinmzent of 'Umar as his successor

taqwa may make greater sacrifices than brothers who are linked by
blood. Sincere brothers are a source of joy at times of ease when one
is happy to meet them and join them in doing righteous deeds; then
when calamity comes and the going gets tough, they are a support to
their brothers and compete in spending and sacrificing, and in
working hard and being
There are some other sayings of 'Umar which became well
known among the people, such as the following:
"When did you enslave people whose mothers bore them fkee?"
"No one is suited to this position except the one who is gentle without
being weak and strong without being harsh."

"I want a man for the position of governorship who, when be is the

4.2. He made Madeenah a centre of fatzuas and fiqh
When the Prophet @)passed away, Madeenah was the capital
of the Islamic state and the seat of the caliphate. The Sahribah there
started to derive Islamic rulings to deal with the new issues that arose
in the Muslim societies as the conquests spread. Madeenah occupied
a prominent position among other regions. The Madeenan society
was that in which the Messenger of Allah &), had lived and where
the first core of the best nation ever raised up for mankind were
guided. Thus it became a society to which no other society could
even come close. 'Umar's presence at the helm of the caliphate in
Madeenah for ten years, with his character and his skill in ruling, had
a great effect on making Madeenah the first school of hadith, fiqh and
tashree' (legislation) in the first and second centuries. This was due
to the following factors:
At the time of 'Umar, Madeenah was the gathering-point of the
Sahribah, especially those who had been among the earliest to
embrace Islam. 'Umar kept them around him so that they would be a
help to hnn in governing the ummah and seeking to benefit from their
knowledge, relying on their sincerity and seeking their opinions and
consulting them. The knowledge of these Sahribah remained in
Madeenah, where the number of fuqaha' among the Sahdbah
reached 130. There were seven who were most active in giving
fatwas: 'Umar, 'Ali, 'Abdulliih ibn Mas'ood, 'kishah, Zayd ibn
Thzbit, 'Abdullzh ibn 'Abbis and 'Abdulliih ihn 'Umar. Abu
Muhammad ibn Hazm said: "The fatwas of each of these could be
compiled lnto a huge book."506
The Sahribah from whom a middling number of fatwas were
narrated include: Abu Bakr [because he lived only a short time after

Most of those whom I have mentioned stayed in Madeenah
during the time of 'Umar ihn al-Khat&ib, except when they were sent
on educational missions or sent for jihad by 'Umar as the result of the
expansion of the state, because the conquered lands needed those
who could teach the people the Holy Qur'an and the Sunnab of the
Prophet (g).
'Umar's policy of making Madeenah a centre of fiqh and
knowledge, and of decision-making and consultahon, bore h i t . One
mdication of the success of thls policy is the report narrated by Ibn
'Ahbk who said: "I was reading Qur'an with some men of the
Muhijiroon, among whom was 'Ahdur-Rwin ibn 'Awf, when I
was in his house in Mina and he was with 'Umar at the end of a Hajj
that he performed. Then 'Abdur-Rmin came back to me and said,
'You should have seen when a man came to Ameer al-Mu'mineen
today and said, '0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen,you should speak to So and
so; he is saying, 'If 'Umar died, I would swear allegianceto So and so
and by Allah, the swearing of allegiance to Abu Bakr was done in a
spontaneous manner'.' ' 'Umar got angry, then he said, 'Insha 'Allih
I am going to deliver a speech to the people after 'Isha', and I will
warn those who want to take control of their affairs unlawfully.'
'Ahdur-Ralpnh said, 'No, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, do not do that.
For on this occasion among the people there are those who have little

understanding and troublemakers, and they will be all around you. I
am womed that you may get up and say something that will be
conveyed everywhere without people understanding it or interpreting
it properly. Wait until you reach Madeenah, for it is the land of hijrah
and Sunnah, where you meet exclusively with the people of fiqh and
the leaders of the people. There you may say what you said with
certainty, and the people of knowledge will understand exactly what
you are saying and will interpret it properly.' 'Umar said, 'By Allah,
if Allah wills, I win do that as soon as I reach Madeenah.' "'08
Ibn Hajar said:
"This hadith provides evidence that the people of Madeenah were
distinguished by their knowledge and understanding, because
' A b d u r - R b k ibn 'Awf and 'Umar were agreed on that. He said,
'This was true in the case of 'Umar's period, but it is not necessarily
the case in all periods.' "509
That period had an effect on the schools that were established
as the society developed and as the conquests spread. The students of
'Umar's school in Madeenah developed their knowledge in
Madeenah, then they become prominent because of their proximity
to the source and because they had stayed in the Madeenan
environment. Some of the students of 'Umar were sent to the
conquered lands to teach and train the peoples who had entered
Islam.
Madeenah became a prominent centre of knowledge and fiqh,
and the Madeenan school influenced the conquered regions
and the
schools which were founded in Basra, Koofah and elsewhere. The
sequence in which the centre of fiqh moved from Madeenah to other

regions is as follows:
Madeenah was the site where the Revelation came down, and
where shari'ah was formed. No other city could match it during the
time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. Madeenah was the centre for the
fuqaha' among the Sahibah, foremost among whom was 'Umar.
'Uthmin was killed in 35 A.H. and 'Ali moved to Koofah, but
Madeenah still remained a centre of knowledge because of the
fuqaha' among the Sahibah who were still alive in Madeenah and
who lived throughout most of the second half of the first century.
They included 'kishah, Abu Hurayrah, Jibir ibn 'Abdulla, Ibn
'Umar, Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq& and others.
The school of the senior Tibi ken was founded in Madeenah,
among whom were the seven jkqaha' who had no equal in other
Muslim regions: 'Ubaydull%h, 'Urwah, Qisim, Sa'eed, Abu Bakr,
Snlaymin and Kh&jah.
The second wave of Tibi'een (the junior Tibi 'een)came along
and lived until the end of the first half of the second century, of whom
we may mention: Ibn Shih2b az-Zuhri, Nifi' ibn Aslam and Y&ya
ibn Sa'eed al-hs&.
Then came the era of Imam Milk, who was one of the
successors of the Tibi 'een. He was one of the most knowledgeable of
people concerning the knowledge of those of the Tibi'een who had
come before him, senior and junior alike.
The fact that the people of the regions needed the knowledge
of the Hijk bears witness to the knowledge of the people of
Madeenah, they would tmvel to Madeenah in pnrsuit of knowledge,
in a manner that was unknown in any other region. The scholars of
the Muslim regions travelled to Madeenah to seek knowledge, and to
discuss their issues with the scholars of Madeenah, who were their
reference point in this regard. The scholars of Madeenah also went to

'Umar ibn al-Khagb

345

the regions as judges and teachers5'', starting with those whom
'Umar sent when he conquered Syria and Iraq, to teach the people the
Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. 'Abdull* ibn
Mas'ood, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamk, 'Amm2r ibn Y&u, ' W n ibn
Husayn and Sa& al-Fiirisi went to Iraq; and Mu'idh ibn Jabal,
'Ubidah ibn %-Skit, Abu ad-Dardi', Bilil ibn Rab* and others
went to Syria. 'Uthmik, 'Ali, 'Abdur-Ralpin ibn 'Awf, Ubayy ibn
Ka'b, Muhammad ibn M a s l a m Zayd ibn Thgbit and others stayed
with 'Umar. Ibu Mas'ood -who was the most knowledgeable of the
Sahgbah who were in Iraq at that time - issued fatwas, then he
would come to Madeenah and ask the scholars there, and if they
suggested that his d i g s were not correct he would adopt their
opinion.51
The Madeenan school influenced all the other schools, and the
knowledge of the people of Madeenah was a reference point for all
the Muslim regions except Koofah; the regions never saw themselves
as the equals of the people of Madeenah in knowledge, such as the
people of Syria and Egypt, such as al-AwSi and the Syrians who
came before and after him, and al-Layth ibn Sa'd and the Egyptians
who came before and after him. It is quite clear that they respected
the actions of the people of Madeenah and followed their early rnadhhub, as did the scholars of Basra, such as Ayyoob, Hamma ibn
Zayd, 'Abdur-Rwan ibn Mahdi and others. Thus the madh-hub of
the people of Madeenah prevailed in those
The people's trust in the knowledge of the people of Madeenah
made them give precedence to it over all other knowledge. AlKhateeb al-Ba&& narrated that when Muhammad ibn al-Hasan

ash-Shaybini narrated to them from M2lk h a house would be full,
but when he narrated to them from anyone other than Milik, only a
few people would attend. He said: "I do not know of any people who
have less appreciation for their own companions than you; when I
narrate to you from Miilk you fill my house, but when I narrate to
you from your companions, you come reluctantly."513
The scholars of regions other than Madeenah varied in their
level of knowledge depending on how much they had learned from
the people of Madeenah. They regarded the knowledge of the people
of Madeenah as the criterion of superiority. Mujihid, 'Umar ibn
Dinar and others from Makkah said: "We remained on an equal
footing until 'AD' ibn Abi Rab* left for Madeenah, when he came
back, his superiority over us was evident."514
One of the main reasons why fiqh flourished in Madeenah at
the time of 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb was the inspired personality of
'Umar himself. The Messenger of Allah @) bore witness to this
quality of 'Umar when he saw that his opinion was always correct.

'Umar made the capital of the state a school from which
graduated scholars, d6 'iyahs,governors and judges. If we look at the
first schools in the Muslim world, we will see the influence that
'Umar had on them, because nearly all of their founders were
influenced by the fiqh of 'Umar (&). There follows a brief
description of these schools.

4.2.1. The school of Makkah
This school occupied a special status in the hearts of the
believers, those who came to the sacred land of AUah as pilgrims and

visitors. Makkah holds a special place in the hearts of every believer
who sees it or longs to see it. There was little knowledge in Makkah
at the time of the Sahibah, then it increased at the end of their period
and in the days of the Tibi'een and the time of their companions,
But Makkah enjoyed a unique
such as Ibn Nujayh and Ibn ~urayj.~'~
blessing at the time of the Tibi'een, namely the presence of the
scholar of the ummah and the interpreter of the Qur'an, Ibn 'AbbG
(&), who devoted all his attention lo learning tafseer and training
his companions in that field, from among whom emerged prominent
Imams who were pioneers in tafeer among the students of other
schools. The scholars have mentioned a number of reasons for the
superiority of the Makkan school, the most important of which is the
The scholars also discussed a

number of the reasons why Ibn 'Abbb was qualified for this role and
why he excelled over other Sahibah in understanding the Book of
Allah and being able to explain it. These reasons are, in brief: the
Prophet's prayer for him, that he might be granted understanding of
religion and knowledge of interpretation; the fact that he learned
ftom the senior Sahibah; his skill in ijtihad and his ability to derive
rules; his interest in tafeer; his unique method of teaching his
companions; his keenness to spread knowledge; his journeys and

earned the special care of 'Umar when the latter noticed in him the
signs of brilliance and intelligence. He would invite him to his
gatherings and bring him close to him, and he would consult him and
follow his opinion with regard to verses of which he was not sure,
even though Ibn 'AhbC was still young. This had a great impact on
him, motivating him to acquire howledge and progress further, and

to focus more on tafeer and other fields of knowledge. It was
ash-Sha'bi that Ibn 'Abbk said: "My father said
narrated from 'h
to me, '0' my son, I see that the Ameer al-Mu'mineen brings you
close to him, and he sits alone with you and consults you along with
some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah @). Learn three
things from me: fear Allah and never disclose his ('Umar's) secrets;
never lie to him, and never backbite about anyone to him. ,,,518
'Umar would include h i alongside the senior Sahibah, and that was
only because he saw in him deep understanding, clear thinking and
subtle insight. Ibn 'Abbis (,&) said: " 'Umar used to ask me
alongside the Companions of Muhammad &), and he used to say to
me, 'Do not speak until they have spoken,' and when I had spoken he
said, 'I feel disappointed that you could not come up with something
like this young man who has not yet reached the age of maturity.' '''I9
Because Ibn 'Abbk was careful to observe proper etiquette when he
sat in a gathering with others who were older than him,he would not
speak until he was given permission. 'Umar noticed that and
encouraged him to speak and to seek knowledge.520

As we mentioned in our commentary on the verses:
$Would any of you wish to have a garden...#

(Qur'an 2: 266)

And:
(When there comes the Help of Allah [to you, 0' Muhammad against
your enemies] and the Conquest [of Makkah1.B (Qur'an 110. 1)

youth and teach them. Ibn 'Abbh was one of those who were close to

'Umar. It was narrated that 'Abdur-Ra?nnh ibn Zayd said: "When
'Umar ibn al-Khagb (&) had offered a nafl prayer, he went into a
mirbad of his and sent for some young men who had knowledge of
the Qur'an, including Ibn 'Abbb. They would come and recite
Qur'an and study together, then when it was time for the siesta he
would depart. When they came to this verse:
(And when it is said to him, 'Fear Allah', he is led by arrogance to
[more] crime. So enough for him is Hell, and worst indeed is that
place to rest! And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking
the Pleasure of Allah. And Allah is full of kindness to [His] slaves.)
(Qur'an 2. 206-207)

Ibn 'Abbk said to someone who was beside him: "The two
men are bound to fight." 'Umar heard what he said, and asked,
'What did you say?" He said, "Nothing, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen."
He asked again, "What did you say? The two men are bound to
fight?" When Ibn 'Abbk saw that he said, "I can see in this verse
that when one is commanded to fear Allah, he is led by arrogance to
(more) crime, and I can see when tbat the one who sells himself,
seeking the pleasure of Allah, gets up and tells the other to fear Allah,
he will not accept it and he will be led by arrogance to (more) crime.
The (good) man will say, 'I sell myself (for Allah),' and he will fight
hi. And the two men are bound to fight.' 'Umar said, 'What a
brilliant thought this is, 0' Ibn 'Abb%.'"521
'Umar would ask Ibn 'Abbk about something in the Qur'an,
and he would say, "Dive, 0' diver!"522
If some difficult cases came to 'Umar, he would say to Ibn
'Abbk: "0' Abu 'Abbk, we have some difficult cases, and you are

And he would not call on anyone else if the matter was d i i 3 i ~ u l t ~ ~ ~
It was narrated that Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq@said: "I have not seen
anyone quicker to understand or smarter or more knowledgeable or
patient than Ibn 'Abbk. I saw 'Umar ibn al-Khagb calling him to
discuss difficult matters and saying, 'Here you are, here is a difficult
problem for you.' And he would follow what Ihn 'Abbk said, even
though he had around him the people of Badr from among the

transmitted the most of 'Umar's tafseer and knowledge. Some of the
scholars have suggested that Ibn 'Abbk acquired most of his
knowledge &om 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them all)?27 This
is indicative of the care that Ihn 'Abbk, the h a m of the Makkan
school, received &om 'Umar and how close he was to him. I think
that this is something that helped Ibn 'Abbk and encouraged him to
go ahead and seek knowledge in general and tafseer in particular."528

those who devoted then lives to knowledge in Madeenah was Zayd

gained many companions. Ibn 'Umar (&) said: " 'Umar sent the
Sahdbah to various countries, but he kept Zayd ibn Thibit in
Madeenah to issuefatwes to its people. Humayd ibn al-Aswad said:

4.2.3. The school of Basra
The city of Bqra was founded by 'Utbah ibn Ghazwh (&),
who founded it in 14 A.H. at the behest of 'Umar ibn al-Kha6b. We
will discuss that further, insha' Alkih, when we discuss 'Umar's
policies on civil development. Bqra is three years older than

~ ~ was
, Koofah's competitor in all fields of knowledge.
Many of the Sahibah (Companions of the Prophet) settled there535,
including Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari and 'hmh ibn Husayn (may Allah
be pleased with them both), and several other Sahdbah, the last of
whom was Anas ibn Miilk (L&,)?~= Among the most famous people
who settled in Bqra were Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari and Anas ibn Maik
(may Allah be pleased with them both). Abu Moosa was one of those
who had come to Makkah and embraced Islam, then he migrated to
Abyssinia with those who migrated there. He was regarded as one of
the most knowledgeable of the Sahibah, who came to Ba~raand
taught there?37 Abu Moosa was influenced by 'Umar and they
corresponded with one another, as we shall see when we discuss the
institutions of governorship and the judiciary. Abu Moosa was
renowned for his knowledge, worship, piety, modesty, proud
independence, renunciation of worldly aims and steadfastness in
Islam. Abu Moosa is regarded as one of the greatest scholars,faqeehs
- jurists - and muftis among the Sahribah. Adh-Dbahabi
mentioned him in Tadhkirah al-ffufli& as being among the senior
ranks of Sahribah and says of him:"He was knowledgeable, active,
righteous and a reciter of Qur'an; he had the most beautiful voice
when he recited Qur'an. He recited good and blessed knowledge and

was the most knowledgeable of the people of Bagra of the Qur'an and

slam."^^^
He spent a great deal of time with the Prophet @), and he
learned from the senior Sahribah such as 'Umar, 'Ali, Ubayy ibn
Ka'b and 'Abdulliih ibn Mas'ood. Abu Moosa was especially
iduenced by 'Umar ibn al-Kha6b. 'Umar used to send him letters
of recommendation and advice during his long governorship in
Basra. Abu Moosa also used to refer to 'Umar concerning all cases
that came before him, and ash-Sha'bi regarded him as one of the four
judges who were the most famous judges of the ummah. He said:
"The four judges are: 'Umar, 'Ali, Zayd ibn 'hibit and Abu
~oosa."~~'
When Abu Moosa came to Madeenah, he was keen to meet
'Umar and he spent a lot of time with him. It was narrated from Abu
Bakr ibn Abi Moosa that Abu Moosa (&) came to 'Umar ibn alKhagb aRer 'Ishi ', and 'Umar asked him: 'What brings you here?"
He said, 'I have come to speak to you." He said, "At this hour?" He
said, "It is a matter of fiqh." So 'Umar sat down and they spoke for a
long time, then Abu Moosa said, "The prayer, 0' Ameer alMu'mineen." He said, "We are in a state of prayer."540
Abu Moosa was keen to seek knowledge and leam, and was
equally keen to spread knowledge and teach the people. He would
urge the people to learn and teach in his khutbahs. It was narrated that
Abu al-Muhallab said: "I heard Abu Moosa on his minbar saying,
'Whoever is granted knowledge by Allah, let him teach it, but let hnn
not speak of that of which he has no knowledge, lest he become one

of those who overstep the mark and go beyond the bounds of
Islam.' "541
Abu Moosa made the mosque of Ba~ra centre of intellectual
activity, and he devoted a large part of his time to gatherings of
knowledge. But that was not enough for him, rather he did not miss
any oppor!mity to teach people. After saying the salrim at the end of
the prayer, he would turn to face the people and start teaching them
and correcting their recitation of Qur'an. Ibn Shawdhab said: "When
Abu Moosa had prayed Fajr he would turn to face the rows, checking
their recitation one by one."542
Abu Moosa was renowned among the Sahribah for the beauty
of his voice and the excellence of his recitation. People used to gather
around when they heard him reciting. When Abu Moosa sat with
him, 'Umx would ask him to recite whatever he could of the
~ u r ' a n Allah

him to teach the Muslims and he did alI that
he could to teach the Qur'an and propagate it among the people in
every land he came to. He used his beautiful voice and his excellent
recitation, and people would gather around him and seekers of
knowledge would crowd around him in the mosque of Ba~ra.He
divided them into groups and circles, and he would go around to
them all, reciting to them and listening to them and correcting their
recitation.544The Holy Qur'an was his main preoccupation and he
devoted most of his time to it, whether he was at home or travelling.
It was narrated that Anas ibn M W said: "Al-Ash'ari sent me to
'Umar (&) and 'Umar asked, 'How did you leave al-Ash'ari?' I
said, 'I left him teaching the people the Qur'an.' He said, 'He is very

prayer, then they sat in circles, and when the time for 'Asr came, the
caller gave the call for 'Asr. The people got up to do wudoo ' again,
and he told his caller to cry out: "No wudoo ' except for the one who
broke his wudoo'.
His teaching efforts bore h i t , and the large number of those around
him who had memorized the Qur'an and acquired great knowledge
thereof, the number of whom in Basra alone exceeded three hundred,

governors to send him the names of those who had memorized the
Qur'an so that he might honour them and increase their stipends, Abu
Moosa wrote to him and told him: "Here in this city there are over
three hundred men who have memorized the Q ~ r ' a n . " ~ ~ ~
Abu Moosa was also concerned with teaching the Sunnah and
its reports. He narrated a great deal from the Messenger of Allah
and from the senior Sahdbah, and many of the Sahdbah and senior
Tdbi'een narrated from him. Adh-Dhahabi (may Allah have mercy on

Abu Moosa adhered h l y to the Sunnah of the Prophet &),
as is indicated by the advice that he gave to his children when he was
dying. Although he was keen to adhere to the Sunnah, he did not
narrate a large number of hadith, as was also the case with other
senior Sahibah, who feared that if they narrated reports from the
Prophet
they would make mistakes. 'Umar would advise his
governors to focus on the Qur'an and not to narrate a great deal of
reports of the Sunnah, and Abu Moosa was strict in his obedience to
'Umar.

Anas ibn Maik an-Naj&i al-Khazraji, the servant of the
Messenger of Allah &) was known as such and took pride in it, and
deservedly so.548He said: ((1served the Prophet (B)for ten years
when I was a boy.549And he said, "The Messenger of Allah (s)
came when I was ten years old, and he died when I was twenty years
old."550 The Prophet @) prayed that he would have a great deal of
wealth, many children and live a blessed life. The Prophet @) said,
"0' Allah, grant him much wealth and many children, and bless them

teaching, and he did some important tasks in the service of the
Rghtly-Guided Caliphs. They appointed him to some high positions
in the Muslim state, especially during the reign of Abu Bakr and
'Umar. When Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari was appointed as governor of
Basrah during 'Umar's reign, he brought h a s close to him and
regarded him as one of his lnner circle. It was narrated from Thibit
that h a s said: "We were with Abu Moosa on a journey, and the
people were talking about this world. Abu Moosa said, '0' Anas,
these people are talking too much. Come, let us remember our Lord.'
Then he said, 'What has slowed the people down (or held them
back)?' I said, 'This world and the Shaytdn and their whim and
desues.' He said, 'No, rather this world is close to them and the
Hereafter is far away from them. By Allah, if only they could see it
with their own eyes they would not turn away from it.'"555
Because Abu Moosa busted Anas, he appointed him to be his
messenger to the caliph 'Umar. Anas said: "Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari
sent me from Bwra to 'Umar, and 'Umar asked me about the people's
situation."556

them close to him and honouring them. He said, "How closely you
resemble the Companions of Muhammad - By Allah, you are
dearer to me than my own chldren, unless my children become as

enabled him to establish a generation of scholars who acquired

conveyed it to those who came after them. The trnstworthy

someone attacks me h m here or there. I am sending to you

'Umar paid attention to Koofah and sent Ibn Mas'ood there,
and he wrote to him saying: "The Qur'an was revealed in the
language (dialect) of Quraysh, so teach it to the people in the
language of Quraysh and not in the language of ~ u d h a ~ l . " ~ ~ '
When he walked out with a group of Sahibah who were
headed for Koofah, to bid farewell to them, he said to them: 'You are
going to the people of a town - meaning Koofah - who recite
Qur'an like the buzzing of bees, so do not distract them with the
hadith, focus on the Qur'an and do not narrate much from the
Messenger of Allah (B).Go, and my good wishes go with you."563
'Umar preferred that they focus on the Qw'an rather than on
the Sunnah, and we can see that in the fact that when he wanted to
wnte down the Sunnah, he consulted the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah @), and they advised him to write it down. He
kept on praying istikhirah for a month, then one day he decided and
said: 'I wanted to write down the Sunnah, but then I remembered
some people who came before you: they wrote books, then they
turned to these books and ignored the Book of Allah. By Allah, I do
not want to cause confusion about the Book of Allah in any way,
'Umar's method was focused on establishing the Holy Qw'an
M y in people's hearts and not distracting them from it, until its
meanings had taken root in society and its sciences were well
established and people could distinguish between it and other Islamic
sciences, including the hadith.565Since the time of the Messenger of
Allah (&, there had been this focus on the Qw'an and the caution

against being distracted from it also dated from that time. 'Umar was
simply following the teachings of the Prophet (2&).566
'Abdullih ibn Mas'ood strove hard to establish a generahon
that could convey the message of Allah with knowledge and
understanding. He had a far-reaching impact on the hearts and minds
of his companions who spent time with him and those who came after
them. 'Umar bore witness to his knowledge. It was narrated that Zayd
ibn Wahb said: "I was sitting among the people with 'Umar, when a
small, thin man came and 'Umar looked at him with a joyful
expression and said, 'A vessel filled with knowledge, a vessel filled
with knowledge, a vessel filled with knowledge.' And that was Ibn
~ a s ' o o d"567
.
The school of Koofah was influenced by Ibn Mas'ood, and it
was one of the schools which most closely followed and imitated its
teacher, even after his death. His influence remained in Koofah for a
long time after he died.568He was greatly influenced by 'Umar's
knowledge, and he would give up his own opinion and adopt
'Umar's opinions instead. He used to say: "If the knowledge of
'Umar ibn al-Khaeb were placed in one side of the balance, and the
knowledge of all the people on earth were placed on the other, the
knowledge of 'Umar ibn al-Khagb would weigh more heavily."569
Ibn Mas'ood (&) stood out among the Sahribah for his
recitation of the Qur'an. He learned seventy-odd Soorahs of the
Qur'an from the lips of the Messenger of Allah &). It was narrated
that Shaqeeq ibn Salamah said: " 'Abdullih ibn ~ a s ' o o daddressed

'Umar (&) acknowledged Ibn Mas'ood's great knowledge of
Qur'an recitation.
And Ibn Mas'ood left behind a number of students who were
famous in the fields of fiqh, knowledge, asceticism (zuhd) and piety,
including 'Alqamah ibn Qays, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda', 'Ubaydah asSalmhi, Abu Maysarah ibn Shur&beel, al-Aswad ibn Yazeed, alH c t h al-Ja'fi, and Murrah a l - ~ a m a d ~ m i . ~ ~ ~

4.2.5. The school of Syria
After the conquest of Syria, Yazeed ibn Abi Suiiyin wrote a
letter to 'Umar ibn al-Khagb in which he said: "The people of Syria
are many and the cities are full; they need people to teach them the
Qur'an and Islam. Help me, 0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, by sending me
men who can teach them." 'Umar called Mu'idh ibn Jabal, 'Ubidah
ibn a s - S b i t and Abu ad-DarW (may AUah be pleased with them
all) and sent them on this great mission. He said to them: "Start with

group of people, then when you are pleased with them, let one of
them you stay on, and one of you should go to Damascus and the
other to Palestine." They went to Homs and they stayed there until
they were pleased with the people and the level of knowledge that
they had reached. Then 'Ubiidah stayed there, and Abu ad-DarM
went to Damascus and Mu'iidh went to ~ a l e s t i n e . 5 ~ ~
The schools in the conquered lands whose foundations were
laid by 'Umar played a role in educating the people. The Syrian
school was established by the efforts of M u e r n ,Abu ad-DarM and
' U b W ibn as-Shit and other Sahribah (may Allah be pleased with
them all). Abu ad-Dad%' had a great study circle (halaqah) in the
mosque of Damascus that was attended by more than sixteen hundred
people, who would recite ten by ten, and Abu ad-DardV would teach
the people different recitations of the ~ u r ' a n . ~Ahu

regarded as the Sahribi who had the most influence in Syria and
Damascus. Adh-Dhahabi said: "Abu ad-DarM was the scholar of the

see your scholars dying and the ignorant among you not learning?
Learn before knowledge is taken away, for the taking away of
knowledge is the death of the scholars.'577And he encouraged the
pursuit of knowledge by saying, 'Be a scholar or a learner, or a lover
(of knowledge) or a follower. Do not be the fifth and be doomed.' "

And he said: "Seek knowledge; if you cannot, then love its

and teach, for the scholar and the learner are equal in reward.580But
you will never be a scholar until you are a learner, and you will never
be a learner until you act on what you know."581And he used to say:
"You will not understand fiqh fully until you see the different
interpretations of the verses of the ~ u r ' a n . " ~ ~ '
It was narrated that when 'Umar wanted to appoint Abu adDarW as governor of Syria, he refused, but 'Umar insisted. Abu adDarW said: "If you accept that when I go there, I will go for the
purpose of teaching them the Book of their Lord and the Sunnah of
their Prophet, and lead them in prayer, then I will go." And 'Umar
accepted that.583
Because Abu ad-Dad2 had a great deal of knowledge in
various fields, his status in the eyes of the Muslims increased. He
gathered many seekers of knowledge around hnn. Whoever had a
question about the shares of inheritance and how to calculate them, or
about a hadith, or about some difficult matter, or about poetry, would
come to him.584Hence his academic influence in Syria was farreaching, especially when it came to teaching the ~ u r ' a n His

When 'Umar was faced with difficult issues, he would consult
the people of shoora including Mu'idh ibn Jabal, Ubayy ibn Ka'h
and Zayd ibn Thibit from among the AnSir591,because of their
knowledge of fiqh and tafeer, and because of then realistic and
practical understanding of events, and their experience, because they
had issued fatwas at the time of the Messenger of Allah &).
'Abdull5h ibn 'Umar (&) loved to listen to the conversations of
Mu'idh and Abu ad-Dardi', and he would say: "Tell us about the two
wise men." It would be said, "Which two wise men?" He would say,
"Mn'idh and Abu a d - ~ a r d i ' . " ~ ~ '
When the caliph 'Umar ibn al-Kha*b delivered a khufbah in
al-Jiibiyah, he said: "Whoever wants to ask about fiqh, let him go to
Mu'idh ibn ~ a b a 1 . "At~ the
~ ~beginning of Abu Bakr's reign, it was
'Umar's view that the caliphate could not do without the presence of
Mu'idh ibn Jabal m its capital, and he was opposed to sending
Mu'idh out of Madeenah. After Mu'idh left for Syna, he used to say:
"His departure is a great loss to Madeenah and its people in the area
of fiqh, because they have lost his ability to issue fatwas to the people
of Madeenah. I used to tell Abu Bakr to keep him here because the
people need him, but he insisted and said: 'A man who desires
martyrdom should not be kept behind.' I said, 'By AUah, a man may
be granted martyrdom when he is in his own bed."594
It seems that 'Umar changed his mind after that, for he sent
him to teach the people of Syria and approved of his staying there.
Mu'idh's going to Syria had a great impact because of the howledge
and fiqh that he left behind. Abu Muslim al-Khawlini said: "I entered

the mosque of Horns and saw nearly thirty old men of the
Companions of the Prophet @), among whom was a young man
with kohl on his eyes and bright teeth, who was silent and did not
speak. If the people were not sure about something, they would ask
him. I said to someone who was sitting beside me: "Who is this?" He
said, ''Mu'iidh ibn ~ a b a l . " ~ ~ ~
M u ' m encouraged the people to seek knowledge, and he
said: "Seek knowledge, for learning for the sake of Allah is piety,
seeking it is worship, discussing it is tasbeeh, pursuing it is jihad, and
teaching it to one who does not know it is charity. Knowledge shows
us what is halril and what is harim, and is the beacon of the people of
Paradise. It brings comfort when one is lonely and shows the correct
way to behave at times of ease and times of hardship. It is a weapon
against one's enemies. Allah raises people (in status) because of it
and makes them among the elite, leaders whose example is followed
and whose opinion is adopted."596
He stayed in Syria, teaching the people their religion, until he
was stricken with the plague of 'Amw% (Emmaus). His companions
wept over him and he said: "Why are you weeping?" They said: "We
are weeping for the knowledge which will be cut off when you die."
He said: "Knowledge and faith will abide until the Day of
Resurrection. Whoever seeks them will fmd them in the Qur'an and
Sunnah. Check everything you hear against the Qur'an, but do not
check the Qur'an against a n y t h g that you hear."597For Mu'$&, the
Qur'an was the standard against which everything else was to be
measured, but it was not to be measured against anything else. This
was Mu'2dh's method in teaching the Qur'an, which he adhered to

regained consciousness and opened his eyes, he would say: "My

'UbiXal~ibn as-Simit was sent to Syria by 'Umar as a judge
and teacher. He stayed in Horns, then he moved to Palestine where he
was appointed as the q8di (judge) and settled there. He was the fmt
one to be appointed as the judge of Palestine, and he also taught its
people the Qur'an, and he stayed there until he died.599
' U b M played a great role in carrying out 'Umar's policies in
the fields of education and jihad. He was one of those who live an
ascetic and rough life. When he came to Homs he said to its people:
"This world is transient but present, and the Hereafter is a true
promise. This world has its children and the Hereafter has its
children, so be children of the Hereafter and do not be children of this
world, for every mother is followed by her children."600
These were ideas which 'Umar was keen to instill in the hearts
of the Muslims, and he chose those among the SahJbah who could
remind the people of them and embody them in their own lives.
' U b M would enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil, without
worrying whether anyone criticized him. When he was a judge in
Palestine, he criticized the governor of Syria for something and said:
"I will never stay in the same land as you." He went to Madeenab and
'Umar said, "What brings you here?" He told him, and 'Umar said:

terms of knowledge. The people of Egypt loved 'Uqbah and narrated

When the Islamic conquests spread and there was a need for
educational institutions, the Islamic cities such as Koofah, Bqra and
al-Fus@ were founded, which in addition to being military bases and
centres the troops and their families gathered also became places
where scholars,&qaha ' and preachers gathered.606'Umar appointed
dii 'iyahs and teachers, and sent them to the conquered lands, and he
clearly stated that one of the most important aims of sending
govemors and agents to the regions was so that they could teach the
people. 'Umar delivered a khutbah in which he said: "0' Allah, I call
upon You to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I have
only appointed them over them so that they may judge fairly amongst
them and teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of their
Prophet
and divide the booty amongst them."607

'Umar allocated payments fiom the bayt al-mil of the
Muslims for teachers and muftis so that they could devote all their
time to their missions of teaching and issumgfatwas. Even those who
taught children were given a stipend by 'Umar. In Madeenah there
were three teachers who taught children, and 'Umar gave each of
them fifteen dirhams each month.608The spread of teaching was one
of the most important aims of the caliph 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb. He
sent people into the deserts and cities who could teach the people
their religion, and he did not rely only on the efforts of the govemors
to spread teaching, rather he supported them with the scholars whom
he sent fiom Madeenah, aRer giving them a great deal of advice. He

He' ~also sent ' h 2 n ibn
Htqayn al-Khuzi'i, who was one of thefirqaha ' of the Sahribah, to
Basra to teach the people there!"
It seems that teaching in Syria was more centralized tban in
other regions, because when 'Umar conquered different countries, he
wrote to Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, who was in charge of Basra, telling
him to build a central mosque, and to build mosques for the tribes,
who were to come to the central mosque on Fridays to attend
Jumu'ah. And he wrote to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqiis, who was in charge
of Koofah, with similar instructions; and he wrote to 'Amr ibn al-'&,
who was in charge of Egypt, with similar instructions. But he wrote
to the commanders of the troops in Syria saying that they should not
go to the villages and leave the cities, and that they should build one
mosque in each city, and not build mosques for the tribes as the
people of Koofah, Ba~raand Egypt had done.611
'Umar sought to appoint specializedunits and send them to the
regions, and he told the leaders and governors, as the conquests
spread, to establish mosques in the conquered regions to be centres
for the new religion, and centres of knowledge to spread Islamic
culture. The mosques were among the earliest academic institutions
in Islam, through which the scholars of the Sahribah were mobilized
to teach the ummah, according to 'Umar's strategic plan, the
foundations of which had been laid down at the time of the Prophet
&).
During 'Umar's reign, the number of mosques in which
Jumu'ah prayers were offered reached twelve

played a role in teaching and disciplining the people. When the
Muslims needed to set up places separate &om the mosque for
teaching children, 'Umar issued orders that schools be built, and he
appointed men to teach and discipline the children.613 'Umar
encouraged the students to acquire knowledge and made it easy for
them; he offered financial rewards as an incentive. He wrote to some
of his agents telling them to award prizes to encourage the best
students, as was manifested in his orders to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq&
(&), telling him to give some of the leftover money to those who
learned the ~ u r ' a n . ~ ' ~
'Umar encouraged those members of the umrnah who devoted
themselves to learning the Book of Allah and memorizing it, so they
encountered nothing but support and encouragement, especially in
the regions where the people were new in Islam, to make them or
their children reach their fullest potential in memorizing and
understanding the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger
&). He took an interest in all the branches of knowledge that had
anything to do with the Qur'an and Sunnah, especially the Arabic
language. Among his sayings concerning that are:

"Leam Arabic, for it makes a person more logical and wise, and
increases his chivalry "615
"Learn grammar as you learn the Sunnahs and shares of
inheritance."616
"Learn I'rcib al-Qurhn (syntax) as you learn to memorize it."617
"The worst of writing is that which is elongated without being clear,
and the worst of reading is to say things unclearly, and the best of

372

Abu Bakr S appoinmzent of 'Umar as his successor

writing is that which is clearest."618
We even see that 'Umar would punish the one who made
mistakes in Arabic when he was in an important position for which
he was expected to be qualified. It was narrated that Abu Moosa alAsh'ari wrote a letter to 'Umar ibn al-KhaMb (&), and 'Umar wrote
back, saying: "Your scribe who wrote to me made a spelling mistake;
give h i one lash of the
Ihn al-Jazwi also narrated that the scribe of 'Amr ibn al-'AS
wrote to 'Umar and he wrote Bismillrih, but he did not write the
(letter) seen. 'Umar wrote to 'Amr, telling him to give him one lash
with the whip. 'Amr did that, and he was asked: "What did he hit you
for?" He said, "For a (letter) seen."620
'Umar was keen that everythmg should be done in a perfect
manner, hence he did not leave alone any matter that had to do with
politics, ecouomics, armies, teaching, literature, or any other matter
that had to do with the life, glory and pride of the ummah, but he
became proficient in it and gave it all his attention. The
comprehensive nature of his policies and his good care of the ummah
is indicated by the fact that he would be strict when it was required
and he would be gentle when it was required, and by the fact that he
insisted that the level of writing among his governors be of a high
standard &-ha) in a nation whose constitution was the Qur'an
which had been revealed in a plain Arabic tongue.6z'

Messenger of Allah @) in Madeenah. 'Umar made use of these
people by directing them in the most appropriate manner. These
groups founded an academic movement which accompanied the
conquests. The scholars of the Sahribah who devoted themselves to
calling and teaching the people managed to establish a generation of
scholars of Islam among the people of the conquered areas. They
were able to overcome the language barrier, because many of the
foreign peoples learned Arabic and many of the pioneers in the
knowledge movement after the era of the Sahribah were in fact nonArabs. The schools of knowledge and fiqh in the conquered areas had
a great impact and formed a generation of scholars who transmitted
the knowledge of the Sahribah to the unnnah,thus forming a part of
the chain of narration which brought the Book of Allah and the
Sunnah of His Messenger @) to the ummah. The credit for
transmitting what the $'ahribah-had learned from the Messenger of
Allah @) must go after Allah, of course -to the founders of the
schools in Makkah, Madeenah, B w , Koofah, Egypt and other
regions.622 'Umar took an ongoing interest in the scholars and

their efforts and they bore h i t .

4.3. 'Umar and poetry and poets
From the reports that have reached us it seems that poetry was
alive and well in Madeenah at the time of 'Umar ibn al-Khatjgb.
There is no book about the history of Arabic poetry that does not fail
to mention 'Umar, especially on the topic of literary criticism. The
spread of critical points of view during his time indicates that people
would listen to and narrate poetry. It is well known that the writing of

literature does not depend on chains of trustworthy narrators, but it is
the only source of information on literature and litemy criticism at
the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the SahGbuh in general
and the TGbi'een who came after them, apart from some proverbs
which were well known at the time of the Prophet @) and were
and the poetry such as that of annarrated in the books of haditl~~'~,
Ngbighah al-~a'di~'~,
Umayyah ibn Abi %-Salt and Has& ibn
~hgbit.~'~
The source for information on poetry at the time of 'Umar is
the books of literature and the men of letters, which are a rich source
of information.

4.3.1.'Urnar and poetry
'Umar (&) was the most inclined of the Rightly Guided
Caliphs to poetry and to commenting on it, and he quoted poetry on
various occasions, so much so that it was said: " 'Umar ibn alKhaGb was hardly faced with any situation but he would quote
poetry about it."626
It is narrated that he went out one day wearing a new cloak,
and the people stared at him and he said (in verse):
"The treasure of Hormuz could not help him, 'Ad tried to be
immortal but they all failed.
Where are the kings to whom riders came from dl directions?
There is a cistern from which everyone drinks and we will inevitably
drink £tom it too."

375

The researcher will note that 'Umar had memorized a great
deal of poetry, both ancient and contempomy, and he could recall it
and quote it readily. This indicates that he had a vast and wellorganized memory, because he always had something suitable on the
tip of his tongue, which he could recall with ease. He even
memorized poetry that expressed hatred of Islam. He recited to
Hassh ibn Thgbit what Hind hint 'Utbah had said against Hamzah
and the Muslims 627, which provoked Hassh to retaliate in kind.
Hence we can say that 'Urnar was a sensitive man of refined
feelings, who could appreciate and recite poetry and express his
opinions concerning it. But he was not a poet as such, as some
researchers have suggested. The suggestion that he was a poet cannot
be accepted by any fair-minded h c , because he lived among his
people like an open book and did not conceal anything &om them. He
held gatherings in which he met with other people and if he had
composed any poetry these people would have narrated it &om hlm
and broadcast it amongst themselves, and it would have reached us
via the narrators as his life story has reached us. Moreover the earliest
critics do not say anything about 'Umar being a poet, and Ibn S a l l h
did not mention him in his Tabaqit, nor did Ibn Qutaybah in his book
ash-Sha'ir w a ash-Shu'ara'. Al-J*i% did not mention that in his
book in which he paid a great deal of attention to 'Umar's eloquence
as d ~ d
and kuowledge of literature.628 Al-Mubarrad stated
Mutammam ibn Nuwayrah in his eulogy of M i l k ibn Nuwayrah that 'Umar said to Mutannnam: "If only I could compose verse as
you did when you eulogized your brother."62g

explained Islamic principles and did not conflict with the teachings of
the new religion or stray &om its values. He encouraged the Muslims
to learn beautiful poetry and said: "Learn poetry for in it are good
things to be sought, bad things to be eliminated and wisdom for those
who seek it, and it encourages good manners."630
He wrote to Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, his governor in Iraq,
saying: "Tell the people there to learn poetry, for it promotes good
characteristics and enriches people's minds and increases knowledge
of lineages."631
He did not stop there; rather he regarded poetry as the key to
people's hearts which motivated them to do good. Concerning the
virtue and benefits of poetry, he said: "The best skill a man can
possess is the skill of composing poetry which helps him to achieve
what he wants, and by means of which he seeks the sympathy of the
noble and to soften the heart of the ignoble.63z

In order to make their children's education complete, he
commanded parents to recite beautiful poetry to them. He said:
"Teach your children swimming and archery, train them to be skilled
on horseback, and teach them beautiful poetry."633
'Umar also took a keen interest in the poetry of the Jdhiliyah,
because of its connection to the Holy Qur'an, as he said: "Hold on to
your records and you will never go astray." Those who were listening
to him said, "What are our records?" He said: "The poetry of the
Jdhiliyah, for in it there is an explanation of your Book and the
meanings of your language."634

This is in accordance with the attitude of his student, the
interpreter of the Qur'an 'Abddl% ibn 'Abbk, who said: "If yon
read something in the Book of Allah which you do not understand,
seek it in the poetry of the Arabs, for poetry is the record of the
Arabs." 635
'Umar believed that poetry was the soundest kind of
lcnowledge from the Jihili era. It is narrated that he said: "Poetry was
the knowledge of the people, and they did not have any sounder
knowledge than it. Then Islam came and the Arabs were distracted
kom poetry by jihad and fighting the Byzantines, and they did not
narrate poetry. When Islam prevailed and the conquests came and the
Arabs settled in the regions, they went back to narrating poetry, but
they could not &d anything written down, but they got used to that.
Then many of the Arabs died or were killed, so only a little of it was
left and most of it was lost."636
'Umar loved those poets who filled his heart with faith and
sublime Islamic values, and put those values in verse which reflected
a true commitment to Islam and spoke of the virtues encouraged by
Islam. As for any other kind of poetry that went against that, 'Umar
rejected it and disapproved of it, and took a strict stance against such
poets. What helped him to distinguish between the two types was his
well-honed sensitivity and his good taste, which went straight to the
heart of the text and explored the values that were compatible with
Islam and did not go against its teachings.637

4.3.2. 'Umar and Huiay'ah and az-Zabarqh ibn Badr
It is narrated that the poet al-Hutay'ah - Abu Mulaykah Jarwal ibn Aws from Banu Qupy'ah ibn 'Abas was on his way to
Iraq, fleeing kom famine with his family and seeking to survive. He
met az-Zabarqin ibn Badr ibn W al-Qays ibn Khalaf at-Tameerni
a~-Sa'di~
who
~ ~ was
,
on his way to 'Umar with the zakah of his
people. Az-Zabarqin recognized him and spoke with him, and
realized what his situation was. So he asked him to stay with his
people and wait for him to come back. So al-Huwy'ah stayed with
them, but Bagheed ibn 'h
ibn Sharnmk ibn Lu'ayy ibn Ja'far Anf
an-Niqah, who was an enemy of az-Zabaqin, managed to turn him
against him and win bim over to his side. He incited him against azZabarqin, and he started to lampoon him in verse and praise Banu
Anf an-Niqah. These insults filled many stanzas, one of which azZabarqin sent to 'Umar, in which al-Huwy'ah said:
"Do not bother with ambition; do not travel to achieve what you
aspire to.
Sit down and you will be fed and clothed."
He complained to 'Umar and said: "He has lampooned me in
verse." 'Umar said, 'What did he say?" He said, "He said to me, 'Do
not bother with ambition...'" and quoted the lines of verse. 'Umar
said: "I cannot see any insult here; it is just a rebuke." Az-Zabarqin
said: "Is all my ambition simply to be fed and clothed?" 'Umar said:
"Bring Hassin to me." So Hassin was brought and he asked him
about it. He said: "He did not lampoon him, he defecated on him." So
'Umar imprisoned him.639 'Umar was the most knowledgeable of
people concerning poetry, but in this case, when he was acting as a
judge, he called on the help of experts in the field to give testimony,

I

'Umar ibn al-Khaecib

379

then he issued his ruling. Al-'Aqqid said of 'Umar in this case: "He
put aside the fact that he himself was well-versed in poetry and used
to narrate it; all he was thinking of was that he was the judge who
tried to avoid punishments if there was any doubt, and he did not
judge according to what he knew without consulting those who were
highly skilled in that field."640
When 'Umar was in prison, he started to seek 'Umar's pity by
writing poetry in which he denied what he was alleged to have done,
but 'Umar did not accept his apology until he wrote more lines in
which he spoke eloquently of his children, whom he described as
little chicks with no feathers and no one to feed them or take care of
them, because he was their only breadwinner, hut he had been cast
into this dark place, and he asked 'Urnar to pardon him.
'Umar wept, moved by these lines of verse, and ordered that he
be released. In order to silence him, he bought the honour of the
Muslims for three thousand dirhams. Al-Huwy'ah composed more
poetry complaining about that.
It seems that al-Huwy'ah was not convinced deep down that
he should stop composing insulting poetry, so 'Umar summoned
him, sat him down in front of him and threatened to cut out his
tongue. Al-Hutay'ah said: "0'Ameer al-Mu 'mineen,by Allah, I have
lampooned my father and my mother, I have lampooned my wife and
I have lampooned myself." 'Umar smiled and let him off.641 AlHuwy'ah stopped writing insulting poetry for the rest of 'Umar's
reign.
There is another, similar, incident that was narrated by the
author of Zahr al-Adbb, where he said: "Banu al-'Ajlk were proud
of their name, because their ancestor 'Abdullih ibn Ka'b had been
'Abqanyah 'Umar, p. 246.

given the name of d-'Ajlin because of his haste (ta yeel) in bringing
food and drink to his guests. It was an honour for them, until anNajishi -whose name was Qays ibn 'Am ibn Ka'b -lampooned
them in a verse in which he suggested that the name had come about
when others told him, "0'slave, go and milk this animal and be quick
about it!"
The narrators say that Banu al-'Ajliin complained about anNajGhi to 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb about these lines, and he imprisoned
him, and it was said that he whipped him too.@'
The caliph 'Umar punished people for lampooning others in
verse, but he also punished people for other types of poetry, such as
casting aspersions on the Muslims' honour, provoking hatred among
the Muslims, and speaking of Muslim women in poems.643

4.3.3. Poetry turned 'Umar's strictness
into gentleness and pity
Umayyah ibn al-Askar al-Kinini - who was one of the
migrated to
leaders of his people and had a son called Kilgb
Madeenah during the caliphate of 'Umar ibn d-KhaEib, and stayed
there for a while. One day he met Talhah ibn 'Ubaydullih and azZubayr ibn d-'Awwh and asked them: "What deeds are best in
Islam?" He said, "Jihad." He asked 'Umar to let him join the troops
who were going to fight in Persia. Umayyah stood up and said to
'Umar, "0' Ameer al-Mu'miizeen, this day I would join the jihad,
were it not for my old age." His son Kilgb, who was a devout
worshipper and an ascetic, stood up and said, "0' Ameer alMu'mineen, I will sell my soul to Allah and I will sell this world for

my Hereafter." His father clung to him in the shade of the palm trees
and said, "Do not leave your father and mother old and weak, who
brought you up when you were small and now when they need you,
you want to leave them." He said, "But I am leaving them for
something that is better for me." And he went out to fight, after
asking for his father's approval. His father was in the shade of the
palm trees and there was a pigeon calling her chicks. The old man
saw it and wept, and the old woman saw it and wept.
Umayyah was blind, so his guide took him by the hand and led
him to 'Umar, who was in the mosque. The old man composed lines
of verse asking 'Umar to bring his son back. 'Umar wept and wrote to
Abu Moosa, ordering him to send Kilib to him, and he sent him
straight away. He came to 'Umar, who told h i to come in, then he
sent for Umayyah and spoke with him for a while, then he asked him
what would be the best thing that he could have that day. He said:
"For Kilib to be with me so that I could smell him." He told Kilib to
come out to him, and the old man got up and started smelling his son
and weeping, and 'Umar started weeping.w Those who were present
wept too and said to Kilib: "Stay with your parents and strive to
please them as long as they are alive, then you can do whatever you
like after they are gone." 'Umar ordered that he be granted a stipend
and let him go with his father. Kilib was one of the best of the
Muslims, and he stayed with his parents until they died.645
A similar incident occurred when the well-known poet
Shaybiu ibn al-Mukhabbal as-Sa'di went with Sa'd ibn Ahi Waqq&
to fight the Persians. His father al-Mukhabbal, who was old and
weak, was very scared for him, and he could not bear his absence. He
composed lines of verse in which he expressed his sorrow and fears.

When 'Umar heard them, he felt sony for him and wept. He wrote to
Sa'd, telling him to send Shaybin back, so he sent him back to his
father.646
This was not the last incident of this kind, when 'Umar was
moved by poetry. Many such incidents have been narrated, such as
when Kharrish ibn Abi Kharrssh al-Hudhali migrated during the
reign of 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, and went out with the Muslims on a
military campaign that penetrated deep into the enemy's land. Abu
Kh&h
came to Madeenah, where he sat before 'Umar and
complained to him of how much he missed his son, telling him that
he was a man whose family had all died and whose brothers had been
killed, and he had no supporter or helper left except his son Kharr%h,
who had left him and gone out campaigning with the Muslims. He
recited lines of poetry expressing these feelings. 'Umar was moved,
and he wrote a letter instructing that K h d h be sent back to his
father. He also issued instructions that anyone who had an elderly
father should not go out to fight unless he gave him permission.647
Thus we may note that 'Umar was moved by poetry, and
because he was so moved, he would weep, even though he was the
one who was known for his toughness and determination. This is
indicative of sensitive and humane feelings, because he felt empathy
for the elderly and feeble fathers who needed their sons. Similarly, he
felt empathy for all those who were oppressed or helpless, and could
feel what they felt, as we have seen above with regard to poew
which lampooned others.648

4.3.4. 'Umar's talent in evaluating poetry
'Umar ibn al-Khaeb was one of those who were most deeply
influenced by the Messenger of Allah M), even in his view of
literature and his judgement of poetry and poets. There are many
reports of his commenting on and critiquing literary texts, most of
which reports stem kom the time of his caliphate, i.e., during the last
ten years of his life. These reports demonstrate how much he
appreciated literature, when he had developed a complete and mature
view as the result of a lifetime of education and experience. Hence we
should examine the factors and circumstances that helped to develop
and perfect his critical senses, taking into account the two halves of
his life -jdhili and Islamic - as follows:
During the Jdhiliyah, 'Umar was one of those who were
responsible for guarding the values of the Jdhiliyah. He enjoyed a
high position among Quraysh who at that time played a central role
among the other Arabs, who looked up to them and loved them. The
same was true in Islam, during the caliphate of 'Umar.
'Umar was well-versed in Arabic poetry, both jdhili and
Islamic, and he understood clearly what the mushrikeen, apostates
and enemies of Islam said in verse against this new religion.

'Umar was knowledgeable about all aspects of Arab life both
during the Jdhiliyah and in Islam. He knew about their beliefs,
history, lineages, conduct and knowledge, which enabled him to
critique words and express his opinion about them.
From an early age 'Umar was keen to join literary circles, in
which there were always chatter, recitation of poetry and discussions
about it, appreciating it and commenting on it. When 'Umar became
Muslim, he regarded sitting with men who would select the best
words in conversation as they would select the best fruits, as one of
the three things that made him appreciate this world, after prayer and

384

jihad for the ssak of Allah. 'Umar was also one of those who spent

time in conversation with the Prophet (g).
established a meeting place at the side of the mosque which was
called al-Bat-ha: which was attended by lovers and students of
poetry?49

(a),

'Umar, the Companion of the Messenger of Allah
was
far-sighted, brilliant, extraordinan'ly intelligent and inspired, which
made him grasp the right meaning of things, and he was hardly ever
wrong. In addition to that, he had the capacity to be moved deeply by
fine verse, for which he would express his appreciation and
admiration. It was narrated that Mutammam ibn Nuwayrah eulogized
his brother Mglii, who had met his end at the hands of the troops of
KhSllid ihn al-Waleed during the Riddah wars, and 'Umar was so
moved by his words that he went to him and said: "I wish I had
eulogized my brother Zayd ibn al-Khagb as you have eulogized
your brother M i l k " He said to h i : "0' Abu Hafs, by Allah, if I had
known that my brother would end up where your brother ended up, I
would have had no need to eulogize him650." 'Umar said: "No one
has ever consoled me as you did."65'
It was narrated that 'Umar said to one of the sons of Haram ihn
S i n k "Recite to me some of what Zuhayr said praising you." So he
recited it, and he said, "He was praising you and he spoke well." He
said, "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, we used to reward him generously."

The standards that affected 'Umar's favouring of one text over
another, or one poet over another, were standards of form. These had
to do with the soundness of the language, because his taste was based
on the eloquence and soundness of the Arabic. He was repelled by
-tical
mistakes, and any such mistakes in a text were sufficient
for him to reject it; he would even punish those who made mistakes
in grammar!53

Using familiar and simple words, and
avoiding obscure and complex words
It is narrated that 'Umar would come to Zuhayr, whose poetry
he liked, and the reason why he liked his poetry was that he did not
use vague or unfamiliar words, and he was not long-winded, and he
would not praise a man unless what he said was true.654
This explains the type of poetry that is acceptable in Islam: it is
poetry that is clear in meaning, uses familiar words, is true to life and
avoids exaggeration, because poetry calls people to a purpose and
addresses the majority of people, so it should be intelligible.655
It is worth pointing out that the scholars of rhetoric, who
subsequently wrote down the standards of rhetoric, did not go much
further beyond what 'Umar stated in this regard.656

Clarity
'Umar wrote to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq& and said: "What
prevented me from writing you a letter was my lack of information
concerning your situation with regard to your enemy. Describe to me
where the Muslims are camping, and the land that is between you and

al-M&in as if I can see it, and give me a clear and full picture of
your situation."657 This last phrase, "Give me a clear picture"
illustrates the importance of clarity of words in 'Umar's view.

The words should fit the meaning
One of the things that are narrated &om 'Umar is his words:
"Beware of l ~ n ~ - w i u d e d n e sItnam
s . ~ ad-D&
said: "This refers
to speech, by adding extra words. 'Umar wanted to avoid use of
excessive words, because that dilutes the idea and distorts it."

The beauty of the right word in the right place
'Umar was repelled by words used in the wrong place, because
that distorts the meaning and undermines the beauty of the words.
For example, when St&aym the slave of Banu al-Has-Gs said in
verse:
"Grey hair and Islam are sufficient deterrent (&om sin) for a man,"
'Umar said, "If you had said Islam before grey hair, I would have
liked what you said."
That is because, with his good taste, he understood that Islam is the
stronger deterrent both before one develops grey hair and after, so it
should have been mentioned first, in accordance with its importance
and the impact it has on people's hearts. This is what was lacking in
this line of verse.659

5. Infrastructure Development and Crisis
Management at the Time of 'Umar
5.1. Mrastructure development
'Umar expanded the Mosque of the Prophet (gJand
incorporated the house of al-'Abb2s ibn 'Abdul-Muwlib into it. The
expansion stretched ten cubits towards the qiblah, twenty cubits
towards the west and seventy cubits towards the north. He rebuilt it
with bricks and palm leaves, made its pillars of wood and gave it a
roof of palm leaves, which he stuccoed to protect the people from the
rain. He forbade adorning the mosque with red or yellow lest that
distract the people from their prayer.660The mosque had a dirt floor,
which he paved with stones so that it would be cleaner for those who
were praying and more comfortable for walking on.66'

'Umar also did some simple alterations to al-Masjd al-Harrim
in Makkah. He moved Maqrim lbrriheem - which was attached to
the Ka'bah - to the place where it is now, to make it easier for
people to do tawef and to pray, and he put the cabinet over it.662He
bought the houses around the mosque and demolished them to add
that space to the mosque. Some of the neighbours of the mosque
refused to sell their houses, so he demolished them and kept the
money for them to take later on. He also built low walls around the
mosque so that lamps could be placed on them.663

Mosques were built in the new cities during 'Umar's caliphate,
when Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq@ laid the foundations of the Jdmi' mosque
in Koofah, 'Utbah ibn G h m h laid the foundations of the J i m i '
mosque in Ba.p, and 'Amr ihn al-'& laid the foundations of the
Jdmi' mosque in al-Fusgt. These large mosques were places where
the Muslims came to pray and where they got to know one another
and studied together, where judgements were passed and the
commands of the caliph were received.666

5.1.1.Roads and means of transportation
by land and sea
The caliph 'Umar allocated a share of the Muslims' public
funds to strengthening the communications between the regions of
the Islamic state. 'Umar set aside a large number of camels -which
were a means of transportation available at that time - to make it
easy for those who had no mounts to move between the Arabian
Peninsula, Syria and Iraq. He also set up something known as drir addaqeeq (lit. house of flour) which was a place where suweeq, dates
and raisins, and other requirements of life were stored, which could
be used by stranded wayfarers and guests who were strangers. On the
road between Makkah and Madeenah he provided whatever
travellers would need and mounts to take them fiom oasis to oasis.
'Umar was following the guidance of the Qur'an which suggests that

cultural development requires effective communications, which
leads to security, so the traveller did not need to carry water or
provisions with him.667And 'Umar issued instructions to the tribes,
generals and governors telling them to do the same.
It was narrated ftom Katheer ibn 'Abdull2h, -From his father,
that his grandfather said: "We came with 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb for
'Umrah in 17 A.H., and the people of the oases on the way asked him
to let them build their houses between Makkah and Madeenah, where
there had been nothing before, and he gave them permission, but he
stipulated that the wayfarers had more right to the water and shade.668
We also see 'Umar's interest in keeping the roads in good
repair in the treaties that he made with some of his governors in the
lands that had been conquered. When Nahawand was conquered, the
people of the two rivers, the Bahradhin and the Dink, came and
asked Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamin for protection in return for paying the
jizyah. He wrote a treaty for the people of each river in which he said:
"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. This is
what Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamh gives to the people of the Dink river.
He gives them security with regard to their lives, their wealth and
their land; they will not be forced to change their religion or
prevented ftom performing their rituals669, and they are to be
protected, so long as they pay the jizyah each year, for each person
who has reached the age of puberty, each according to his means, to
the Muslim governor who is appointed over them, and so long as they
guide the wayfarers, maintain the roads, show hospitality for one day
and one night to the Muslim troops who come to them, and are
sincere. If they betray and cheat us then the treaty is broken.

Witnessed by al-Qa'q? ibn 'Amr and Nu'aym ibn Muqrim; written
in Mubarram 19 A.H."~~'
From this document we can see that 'Umar understood the
basic principles of civilization and he made the maintenance of roads,
which is vital for any nation to engage in trade and warfare,
compulsory on the people of the conquered lands. From 16 A.H.
onwards, 'Umar's ambition was focused on establishing citics in
Iraq, digging waterways and repairing bridges.671
In 'Iyws treaty with the people of ar-Rahi it says: "In the
name of Allah, this is a letter from 'Iyid ibn Ghanam to the bishop of
ar-RahP If you open the door of the city on the basis that you will pay
me a dincir and two mudds of wheat for every man, you, your lives
and your wealth and those who are with you will be safe. You are
obliged to guide those who are lost, maintain bridges and roads and
be sincere towards the Muslims. Allah is my witness and AUah is
sufficient as a witness."672

When 'Umar ibn al-KhatJ2b (may Allah be pleased with him)
learned that there used to be a waterway that ran between the Nile,
from a place near the fortress of Babliyon to the Red Sea, which used
to connect the Hi& to Egypt and facilitate trade, but the Byzantines
had neglected it and it had been filled in, he ordered his governor in
Egypt, 'Amr ibn al-'As (may Allah be pleased with him), to dig this
waterway again. So it was dug again, and it became the route
between the Hijk and al-Fus@t,the then capital of Egypt. It became
a channel of trade that brought prosperity to the region between the
Nile and the Red Sea once again. On the banks of this waterway in alFus@ there were established parks, gardens and residential areas,

As the conquests spread huther, the Muslim state at the time of
'Umar began to build cities on the borders and to make the means of
transportation and development of the land easier. 'Umar also
encouraged people to migrate to the centres where the troops
gathered for jihad, and to move to the conquered lands in order to
spread Islam and supply the Mujdhdeen with men and weapons. The
most important cities which were founded at this time676were Bqra,

Abu Bakr 5 appoinhent of 'Umar as his successor

set aside common land (al-hima) for grazing the horses and camels of
the Mujihideen. He encouraged the people to bring their wives and
children from the cities of the Hijaz and all parts of Arabia to settle in
these cities, so that they would become military bases from which the
armies could be mobilized and supplied, to penetrate deep into
enemy land and spread the call of Islam therein.
'Umar commanded the leaders of his d e s , when they drew
up the plans for these cities, to make the routes between them and the
capital of the caliphate easy, with no seas or rivers in between,
because 'Umar was concerned about the Arabs' ignorance of sea
travel at that time. But when he realized that the Muslim army in
Egypt had learned how to make use of the water routes on rivers and
by sea, he allowed 'Amr ibn al-'& to dig a canal that connected the
Nile to the Red Sea, so that food supplies conld be transported to the
13ijaz678,as we have stated above.
'Umar ibn al-Khasb (&) established these cihes and
recruited soldiers as the state expanded and the conquests increased,
and the distances between the Muslims in different areas became
greater. The troops needed places where they could rest from their
tiring journeys, and places they where they conld find shelter in the
winter and when they returned from campaigns. So there were
motives for building these cities. So long as the aim of conquest was
to spread the call of Islam and convey it to nations, peoples and
individuals, it was essential to establish Islamic life where these
nations could see it in practice and these individuals could experience
it. So the Islamic cities were established on an Islamic basis in which
Islam could be lived out m a complete sense. Koofah, Ba~ra,al-Fus@
and Mosul were Islamic cities, at the centre of each of which was the
mosque, with houses for the troops spread around it. In these model

'Umar ibn al-Khaffdb

393

societies, the Islamic idea showed its strength and foundations: its
strength represented by the army and its foundations represented by
the Book of Allah. These were societies which applied the rulings of
Allah in full, to themselves and in all their affam. They were always
ready to shed blood for the sake of Allah. From these societies Islam
emerged as a light to the conquered lands; it guided the inhabitants of
those lands, applied justice in its rulings and accepted those who
became Muslim. These were the most brilliant methods of spreading
the message and presenting it to those who were not familiar with it.
No Islamic cihes were built in Syria, because there were many
houses there which had been abandoned by the Byzantines when
they left, and which were taken over by the Muslims, so there was no
need to build new ones. There were also many Arabs already m
Syria, so each tribe could find relatives there.679
Among the most important cities that were founded during the
time of 'Umar (&) were the following:

Bays
The meanmg of the Arabic word bqrah is rugged land with
solid rocks; or it was said that it means pebbled land, or soft white
rocks. Basra is a city which is located at the point where the Tigris
and Euphrates meet, a meeting point which is known as Shag al' ~ r a b . ~ ' When
'
it was established, 'Umar's idea of paying attention
to the Arab way of life was taken into account. Its location was close
to water and grazing land, between cultivated land and wilderness.
The reason why the Muslims had camped there during the time of
Abu Bakr was that Qutbah ibn Qatidah adh-Dhuhali or Suwayd ibn
Qutbah - according to different reports - had been fighting the

Abu Bakr S appointment of 'Umar as his successor

Persians, along with a number of his people, in the region of Bqra,
and Kh2id ibn al-Waleed had told h i to stay there as a governor and
leader in that area. When 'Umar ibn al-Khatjib became caliph, he
appointed 'Utbah ibn Ghanvh, one of the earliest Companions of
the Messenger of Allah (g),
as the governor and commander in that
area, and said to him: "Keep the people of al-Ahwk, Persia and
Maysin busy there (by fighting them) and distract them from helping
their brothers." And he commanded Qutbah (or Suwayd) to join him.
So 'Utbah went with more than three hundred men and Qutbah
joined him with those who were with him of Bakr ibn W2il and
Tameem, and camped there in Rabee ' al-Awwril (or Rabee ' al-Jkhir)
14 A . H . ~ ' ~
'Utbah consulted 'Umar with regard to establishing a city in
Basra, and he commanded him to choose a place that was close to
water and pasture land. He chose the site of Basra and wrote to
'Umar, saying: "I have found land that is between cultivated land and
wilderness, with ponds and reeds nearby." 'Umar wrote back telling
him to settle there. So he settled there and built its mosque from
reeds, and bnilt his governor's house near the mosque. The people
bnilt seven residential areas from reeds too, because there were so
many available there. When they went out on a military campaign,
they would pull up the reeds and stack them in piles until they came
back from the campaign, then they would rebuild the houses. But the
reeds were bumed in a fire, so they asked 'Umar for permission to
build with adobe bricks and he gave them permission; that was
during the governorship of Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, after 'Utbah had
died in 17 A.H. Abu Moosa built the mosque and the governor's
house with adobe and mud, and gave it a thatched roof. Then he
rebuilt it with stones and bricks, and allocated areas to different

I

'Umar ibn al-KhaEib

395

tribes. He made the main streets sixty cubits wide, the other streets
twenty cubits wide and the alleys seven cubits wide. In the middle of
each loop of houses they left a spacious area to tie their horses and
bury their dead, and the houses were joined on to one another!'
'Umar ordered Abu Moosa to dig a channel for the people of
Basra, so he dug the channel of al-Ablah towards Basra for a distance
of three parasangs.683
Thus the Muslims became pioneers m the area of town
planning, and the Muslims of Bqra became rich as the result of the
. 6 ~ were
~ motivated
conquests of al-Ablah, Dast and ~ a ~ s i nPeople
to come and settle there, and they came seeking wealth as those who
came before them had come seeking jihad. So a mixture of tribes and
a mixture of ambitious individuals and merchants came to Basra and
its number of inhabitants increased greatly.685
From the historical reports, researchers have concluded the
military and economic considerations that 'Umar had in mind when
he founded these cities:
These cities were established on the fringes of Arab land, next to nonArab lands, so that they could serve as strongholds which the enemy
could not hope to get past.
These locations were suitable for Arabs, because the Arabs at that
time formed the majority of the forces who were engaged in jihad for
the sake of Allah, and they could not live anywhere unless there was
grazing for their camels, as 'Umar explained.

Locations for cities were chosen at the edge ofwild land belonging to
the Arabs so that they could find the pastures they needed for their
flocks. They chose land that was also close to non-Arab villages so
that the produce of these villages, such as yoghwt, wool, grains and
h i t s , would be readily available. When 'Umar read the letter of
'Utbah ibn Ghazwin about the land of Bqrah he said: "This is green
land that is near water and pastures and f ~ e w o o d . "This
~ ~ ~is
indicative of sound military strategy and good planning which took
into account the circumstances of both war and peace, as well as the
necessity of securing a water supply and establishing short supply
lines and sources of fuels such as firewood which every city needs.
It was also important to ensure that there were no natural obstacles
such as rivers which would prevent support from the seat of caliphate
from reaching the battlefront.687
The cities were also organized according to the tribal system of the
army. Each tribe was accommodated in houses in a single
neighbourhood.688

Koofah
Historians are agreed that Sa'd ibn Abi Waqq@ (&) is
regarded as the original founder of this city. He chose its location and
ordered that it be planned and laid out after a series of victories which
the Muslims achieved in their wars against the Persians in the region
of al-MadTin. As was the case in the selection of the location for
Bqra, military factors played a basic role in motivating Sa'd to think
of choosing a place for the Mujihideen to camp689,which he did after

'Umar commanded him to do so. Sa'd's choice of a location for
Koofah was in accordance with the standards laid down by 'Umar,
who had noticed a change in the faces of those who came kom alQidisiyah and al-Madi'in, and he realized that this was due to the
bad climate. So he wrote to Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqis, telling him to find
a place that suited them and their camels. He sent Salmin al-Firisi
and Hudhayfah ibn al-YamSm as scouts to look for the best location
for Koofah, and they found a spot between al-Heerah and the
Euphrates. It was so called because it was sandy and pebbly, and such
land is called koofah in ~ r a b i c . ~ "
So Sa'd moved kom al-Madi'in to Koofah in M u ~ a n a m17
A.H. 'Umar wanted the Muslims to stay in their tents because that
was better for the purpose of war, and made them look ready and
more fightenmg to their enemies. But when the people of Koofah
and Bqra asked him for permission to build with reeds, he did not
want to go against their wishes and he gave them permission. So the
people built with reeds, then the fires in Koofah and Bqra destroyed
the reeds, so they asked 'Umar for permission to built with adobe and
he said, "Do that, but no one of you should have more than three
rooms; and do not compete in constructing tall buildings." 'Umar
wrote to 'Utbah and the people of Basra with similar instructions. He
put '&im ibn ad-Dulaf Abu al-JarW in charge of the settlement and
construction of Koofah, and Abu al-Hayyij ibn Milik al-Asadi in
charge of the settlement and constrnction of Bqra. Abu al-Hayyij
planned the layout of Koofah in accordance with 'Umar's
instructions. The main roads were to be forty cubits wide, secondary
roads were to be thirty cubits wide, lesser roads were to be twenty
cubits wide, and the alleys were to be seven cubits wide, and there
was nothing narrower than that. The first thing that he planned was

398

the city's mosque, then a skilled archer stood in the middle of the city
and shot arrows to his right and his left, m fiont of him and behind
him. Then he ordered that construction should begin outside the area
defined by the arrows. In fiont of the mosque he built a canopy for
shade which covered two hundred square cubits and was supported
on columns of marble. They built a house for Sa'd near the mosque,
with a roadway between the two buildings, and they put the treasury
(bayt al-mil) in that house. The constmction was done by Roozabah
al-~irisi!~'

After it was founded, it was inhabited by Muslim Mujihideen,
then by a Persian group of four thousand, which was one of the
brigades of Rustam who were known as the troops of the Shahinshah,
and who sought safety to camp wherever they wanted and to make
alliances with whomever they wanted, and to be given some salary.
Sa'd gave them what they wanted. They had a leader whose name
was Daylam, and they were h o w n as Hamra' ~ a ~ l a r n . 6 ~ '
Koofah was also settled by some of the Jews and Christians of
NajGn when 'Umar expelled them from the Arabian Peninsula. They
settled in an area of Koofah which became known as an~ajriini~ah.~~~
After the establishment of Basra and Koofah they became
important and famous as centres of jihad and of knowledge and
literature throughout the Muslim world. The seat of power moved
there fiom the Hijaz when 'Ali ibn Abi mib (&) adopted Koofah as
the seat of his caliphate, after the centre of Islamic power moved to

'Umar (&) based the planning of Basra and Koofah on sound
principles, making the roads wide and well organized, which is
indicative of his brilliance in the field of construction. Koofah
combined the role of a city with the fresh air and earth of the
countryside, which was more healthy and comfortable, because wide
roads in the city act like lungs in the body. 'Umar wanted those who
settled in Koofah to live in tents because it would be quicker to
mobilize them when needed and more alarming in the eyes of the
enemy, but subsequent developments led to the city being built of

'Umar's fear that the Muslims would start
to indulge in a life of luxury and ease
'Umar feared that the Muslims would start to indulge in a life
of luxury and ease, which would lead to regrettable consequences in
this world and in the Hereafter. When people settled in Koofah and
Bqra, they went back to their old habits. Then the people of Koofah
asked for permission to build with reeds, and the people of Bqrah did
likewise. 'Umar said: "Tents are better for you, because you are in a
state of war, but I do not want to go against your wishes. What are
reeds?" They explainedthat to him, and he said: "It is up to you." So
the people of the two cities built houses with reeds.696
Then fues broke out in Koofah and Bqra, and the worst bit of
the two was Koofah, where eighty houses were burned and there was
nothing left. The people kept on talking about that, and Sa'd sent a
group of them to 'Umar, to ask him for permission to build with
adobe bricks. They came to him with news of the tire and what had
happened to them - and they never did anything or refrained from
anything without consulting him. He said, "Do that, but no one of

400

Abu Bola b appoinlment of 'Umar as his successor

you should have more than three rooms, and do not compete in
constructing lofty buildings. Adhere to the Sunnah and you will
prevail." So the people went back to Koofah with this message, and
'Umar wrote to 'Utbah and the people of Bqrah with a similar
message. 'Umar also advised that delegation, and asked the people in
general, not to make their buildings any taller than what is
reasonable. They said: "What is reasonable?" He said: "That which
does not bring you close to extravagance and which serves the
intended purpose."697
From this report it is obvious that those people did not care
about worldly show. All they wanted in their dwellings was
protection from the sun, rain, cold and heat, and they did not care
about having palaces or lofty houses. Hence they chose to build with
reeds, which were the easiest things available to them, until they were
forced to build with mud bricks. But nevertheless we see 'Umar
imposing restrictions on them, to prevent them competing in
constructing lofty buildings. This is indicative of his farsightedness
concerning the wealth which he expected the ummah to acquire afier
the conquests. With these and similar instruchons he sought to check
the ummah's rush towards extravagance and luxury, and to make it
live a life of moderation. From the words of 'Umar it is clear that
what is meant by the kind of construction in which there is no
goodness is that which is luxurious and goes beyond the level of
moderation. One of the greatest manifestations of extravagance is
competing in the construction of lofty buildings, because
construction consumes a great deal of a person's wealth and
time, and if a person focuses on it, it will dominate his thoughts and
become the major concern with some people.698'Umar was worried
about the worldly gains made by the ummah during his reign, and he

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

401

tried to prevent them from indulging in that. He wanted the
construction of houses to be a simple matter that could be achieved
within a short period of time. Nowadays building a house may take
years and put a person in debt which he does whatever he can to pay
off; years may pass without him paying a penny in &ah even though
he is regarded as well off, because the palaces that most people aspire
to require high quality furniture and other extravagances that drain
the energy of the one who seeks them and keep him working hard for
many years as he seeks to compete with others in worldly matters. In
the midst of this competition, he neglects some of the essential duties
of Islam, such as the financial acts of worship, chief among which is
zakah and spending on the Mujrihideen who are striving for the sake
of Allah. People may also be distracted by such worldly pursuits
from other important duties such as prayer and seeking
knowledge.699

which does not bring you close to extravagance
and which serves the intended purpose"
"%f

This means that the k i d of construction that is allowed in
Islam is that which does not bring a person close to extravagance and
does not go beyond the limit prescribed in Islam or go beyond the
bounds of moderation. 'Umar did not strictly define that for them,
because each land has its own customs as to what constitutes
extravagance, moderation and stinginess. So what is moderate is to
be defined according to the prevailing custom in the land among the
middle ranks of those who are righteous in terms of worldly
matters.700

402

Abu Bakr k appoinimeut of 'Umar as his successor

"Adhere to the Sunnah and you will prmail"
This means that adherence to the way of the Messenger of
Allah @) is a cause of prevailing over the people and being given
power in the land, as Allah (g)
says:
(Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous
good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to [the
present rulers] in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and
that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which
He has chosen for them [i.e. Islam]. And He will surely, give them in
exchange a safe security after their fear [provided] they [believers]
worship Me and do not associate anything [in worship] with Me. But
whoever disbelieved after this, they are the Fisiqoon [rebellious,
disobedient to Allah].$
(Qur'an 24. 55)
'Umar encouraged people to shun worldly gains even though
at that time the Muslims were competing with one another in
asceticism and shunning worldly gains. So how about those who
came after them, who competed with one another in worldly gains?
'Umar was also keen to tackle the issue of materialistic accumulation
at his time, when Persia and parts of the Byzantine lands had been
conquered and Allah had granted a great deal of wealth to the
Muslims from the booty acquired through conquest and the taxes
acquired from those lands. He delivered an eloquent khutbah in
which he described the new situation and advised the Muslims to
follow the better way.
He said: "Allah - All-Glory and Praise be to Him - has
made it obligatory upon you to give thanks, and He has established
proof by guiding you to the honour of this world and the Hereafter,
without you asking for it or desiring it. He created you from nothing
so that you might worship Him, and He was able to make you the
least significant of His creation, but He made most of His creation for

'Umar ibn al-KhaMb

403

you and did not create you for anyone else but Himself. He has
subjugated for you everything that is on land and sea, and has granted
you goodly provision so that you might give thanks. Then He gave
you hearing and sight. Some of His blessings are granted to all the
sons of Adam and some are granted only to the followers of your
religion. Now these blessings have all fallen under your control in
your time. There is not a single blessing that has come to any specific
person but if it were to be divided among all the people they would
have to strive hard to give proper thanks for it, and they would not be
able to do so without the help of Allah and without believing in Allah
and His Messenger. You have been granted authority in the land and
are subjugating its people. Allah has granted victory to your religion,
and there are only two types of people left: those who have become
subjugated to Islam and its people, who pay the jizyah to you &om
the best of their wealth, who work hard and you benefit; and those
who are expecting the decree of Allah to befall them at any moment,
day or night, whose hearts are filled with fear; they have nowhere to
run or hide, for the troops of Allah are about to attack and will soon
conquer their lands. With the abundance of wealth, continuing
conquests, guarding the borders by Allah's leave, with the general
well being which has never been experienced since the beginning of
Islam, Allah is to be praised for the great conquests in every land.
What thanks can there be in comparison to all these innumerable
blessings? No one can give sufficient thanks except with the help and
mercy of Allah. We ask Allah, besides Whom there is no other god,
to bestow this upon us, to help us to obey Him and hasten to please
Him. 0' slaves of Allah, remember Allah's blessings to you and
praise Him for His favours. Allah (&) said to Moosa:

B... Bring out your people fiom darkness into light, and remind them
of the annals of Allah... b
And He said to Muhammad @J:

(Qur 'an 14: 5)

404

Abu Bakr 5. appointment of 'Umar as his successor

(And remember when you were few and were reckoned weak in the
land...$
(Qur'an 8: 26)

If you had been reckoned weak in the land and were deprived
of the good of this world whilst adhering to a branch of faith and
believing in it, fmding comfort in it and having knowledge of Allah
and His religion, putting your hopes in the Hereafter, that would have
been fine. But you were living a hard life and were ignorant of Allah.
If Islam had been the only thing that Allah had given you and there
were no worldly blessings with it except that blessing in the Hereafter
where everyone will end up, and you had faced hardship in life as
you did before you became Muslim, then you should be very keen to
adhere to Islam and support it against all others. So how about when
you have been granted the best of this world and of the Hereafter, and
whoever among you want to do so may have both? I remind you that
Allah knows what is in your hearts, so you should remember the
rights of Allah and strive for His sake, and force yourselves to obey
Him. Try to combine your delight in these blessings with the fear that
they may disappear and be taken away... It is my duty before Allah to
enjoin upon you that which is good and to forbid to you that which is
evil. "701

If Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqb is regarded as the founder of Koofah,
'Amr ibn al-'AS is regarded as the founder of al-FusEt. After he had
conquered Alexandria, he wanted to settle there, but 'Umar ibn alKhagb wrote to him, saying: "Do not let there be any water between

The first thing he did there was to build its mosque which was
named after him, like the mosque that he built in Alexandria. Then he
built a house for 'Umar ibn al-Khaeb, which he probably intended
to be for the caliphs. 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb wrote to him and told him

to make it a marketplace for the ~ u s l i r n s 'Amr
two houses for himself near the mosque, as Ibu 'Abdul-Hakam tells
us: " 'Amr ibn al-'& laid the foundations for his house which is now
at the gate of the mosque, with the road running between them and
his other house, which is attached to the side of it.'04 He may have
built one house for himself and the other as an administration
building, aRer 'Umar had told him to demolish the house mentioned
above.
'Amr ibn al-'As delegated a number of senior Sahbbah who
were with him to allocate an area for the houses of each tribe, and
these areas were clearly delineated, like quarters or neighbowhoods
nowadays. But they were not so big as to have roads between one
tribe and another. They were probably not roads as we know them
nowadays but rather small footpaths between one quarter and the
next. That group of Sahibah was composed of Mu'iwiyah ibn
Khadeej at-Tajaybi, Shareek ibn Summi al-Ghutayti, 'Amr ibn
Malpam al-Khawlhi and Huwayl ibn Nishirah al-Mu'&. They are
the ones who allocated land to different tribes in 21 A.H.~'' Although
we do not have room here to list all the neighbonrhoods, we may
mention some of them, such as: Aslam, al-Laytoon, Bani Mu'idh,
Bali, Bani B m , Mahrah, Lakhm, Ghifiq, as-Sadaf, Ha-awt,

tribes -Arabs and otherwise -took part in the conquest of Egypt,
hence there were many quarters formed of these tribes. Each tribe
wanted to have its own area where it could run its own affairs. We also
learn that the plans approved by 'Amr ibn al-'& to divide the land
among these tribes were well thought
Each tribe built a
mosque in the middle of its area. In his book al-Fa& 'ilal-Bdhirahfee
Mahisin M q r wa al-Qihirah, Ibn Zaheerah quoted Ibn Zawlgq's
comments on the early mosques of al-Fus@t. He said that the first
mosque was that of 'Amr ibu al-'As, then he listed other mosques that
were named after individuals708,alter which he said: "Apart from
those that we have mentioned, there are tWO hundred and thirty-three
other mosques that were built by the Sahdbah when they conquered
Egypt, and they were built to accommodate each tribe."709

'Amr ibn al-'As did well in his choice of location, because it
facilitated contact with the caliphate as well as being centrally located
between the north and south of the country and close to the ~ i l e . ~ "

began with the city of Sirt which is between Barqah and Tripoli and
took control of it. The Muslims adopted it as a base for expeditions to
the west from 22 A.H., and it remained a base for the Muslim forces
and was a centre for 'Uqbah ibn Ngfi' whose main aim was to spread
Islam in the nearby oases of F a z h , Waddin, Zuwaylah and

Garrisons stationed in the conquered cities
'Umar set up garrisons in the conquered cities throughout the
conquered lands, especially in Syria. They had barracks where the
soldiers stayed and in evtxy camp there were stables for the horses, in
which there were no less than four thousand horses with all their
equipment which was kept in a state of readiness712, so that if
necessary the generals could head out for the battlefield within the
shortest time, with more than 36 thousand horsemen in one go in
Syria alone. In each garrison, a huge area was set aside for these
horses to graze. Each horse was marked on its thigh with the words
Jaysh fee sabeel-ilkih (an army for the sake of Allah), in accordance
with the verse:
&4nd make ready against them all you can of power, including steeds
of war to threaten the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others
besides whom, you may not know hut whom Allah does know. ..b
(Qur'an 8: 60)
Garrisons in Syria
These garrisons in Syria included the following:
The garrison of Damascus:
During 'Umar's time this ganison was commanded by three people
who were, in order: Yazeed ibn Abi Snfiyk, Suwayd ibn Kulthoo~n,
and Mu'gwiyah ibn Abi Suiiyk.

The desue for jihad and seeking the pleasure of Allah
motivated many of the Sahdbah and the scholars among the Tdbi 'een
to move to these cities, which were called thughoor (outposts) and
spread the call of Islam and jihad for the sake of Allah, and teach the
people the Qur'an and Sunnah. Madeenah, Basra, Koofah, Damascus
and al-Ens& all became areas which attracted people to come and
settle in them, seeking knowledge and jihad, or seeking to enlist in
the army and be given a stipend, or to engage in trade and learn new
skills. Thus these cities became beacons of culture and development
in which all branches of knowledge flourished and all kinds of skills
and professions developed.714

5.2. Economic crisis (the year of ar-Ramgdah)
During the reign of 'Umar the Islamic state was faced with
severe trials. This is something that all nations, states, peoples and
societies must inevitably undergo, and the Muslim ummah is one of
these nations. The laws of Allah do not change or alter. Among the
greatest trials that were faced at the time of 'Umar were the year of arR a d d a h and the plague of 'Amwis. In this section we will discuss
how 'Umar dealt with these crises and the measures he took, how he
beseeched Allah and called upon Him. In 18 A.H. the Arabian
Peninsula was strnck by a severe famine and drought, and hunger
grew so severe that the wild animals started coming into the towns,
and if a man slaughtered a sheep he would not be able to eat it
because it was so scrawny, and the flocks died of hunger. This year
was called the year of ar-Ramidah because the wind blew the dust
around like ashes (ar-rams). The drought was severe and there was
no food to be had. The people flocked from the farthest deserts to
Madeenah to stay in the city or nearby, seeking a solution with the
caliph. 'Umar felt the impact of this calamity more than anyone else,
and he was well aware of the burden of responsibility?15 It is possible
to note the following steps that 'Umar took to deal with this crisis:

5.2.1. Setting an example to the people himself
During the year of ar-Ramidah, some bread soaked in ghee
was brought to 'Umar. He called a Bedouin man to eat with him, and
the Bedouin started to wipe up extra ghee with his finger after each
mouthful. 'Umar said to him: "It seems that you have not had any fat
for a long time." The Bedouin said, "I have not eaten any ghee or

olive oil, nor have I seen anyone eating them, since such and such a
time until today." 'Umar swore that he would not taste any meat or
ghee until the famine was over and the people went back to normal.
The narrators are unanimously agreed that 'Umar was very s ~ cint
fulfilling this vow. For example, when a skin full of ghee and some
yoghurt came to the market, 'Umar's slave bought them for forty
dirhams and brought them to 'Umar and said: "0' Ameer alMu'mineen, Allah has fulfilled your oath and your reward will be
great. Some yoghurt and ghee came to the market and I bought them
for forty dirhams." 'Umar said, "That is too expensive; give them in
charity, for I do not want to eat something extravagant." Then he
followed that by saying, "How could I care for the people properly if
I do not feel what they
These words of 'Umar explain one of tbe most brilliant
principles of the art of d i n g that humanity has ever known: how can
a ruler really care for his people if he does not feel what they
During the year of ar-ramidah, 'Umar was affected so much
that his colour changed. It was narrated that 'Iyid ibn Khaleefah said:
"I saw 'Umar during the year of ar-ramidah and his face looked
black. He was an Arab man who used to eat ghee and yoghurt, but
when the famine came he forbade himself to eat those things, and he
ate olive oil until his colour changed and he became very hungry. ."7'8
It was narrated that Aslam said: "We used to say that if Allah had not
lifted the famine during the year of ar-ramidah, we thought that
'Umar would have died out of concern for the ~ u s l i m s . " ~ ' ~

'Umar used to fast all the time, and during the year of arr a m w , when evening came he would eat some bread soaked in
olive oil. Then one day he slaughtered a camel to feed the people, and
they kept the best parts for him. They brought him some of the hump
and liver. He said: "Where did this come fkom?" They said, "0'
Ameer al-Mu'mineen, it is fi-om the camel that we slaughtered
today." He said, 'Wo, no, what a bad ruler I would be if I ate the best
of it and gave its bones to the people. Take this plate away and bring
me some other food." Some bread and oil was brought to him and he
started to break the bread and dip it in the oil, then he said: "Woe to
you, 0' ~arf^a'~'~;
take this dish to the household of Yathmagh, for I
have not been to them for three days and I think that they have
nothing to eat, so give it to them.""'
This is how 'Umar was, and this is the art of ruling in Islam,
where the ruler should put the people before himself so that they eat
better than he does. Even though with the burdens ofruling he had to
put up with more than they do, and suffer much more than they did,
'Umar did not put restrictions on himself only, rather he applied the
same restrictions to the members of his family. They also had to
suffer more than the people did. One day during the year of arramidah, he saw one of his sons holding a piece of watermelon and
said, "No, no, 0' son of the Ameer al-Mu'mineen! How can you eat
h i t when the ummah of Muhammad is starving?" The boy ran away
crying, and 'Umar did not rest until he had asked him about that, and
found out that his son had bought it for a handful of dates.722

'Umar's awareness of the responsibility of ruling before Allah
overwhelmed him, and he did not leave any means, spiritual or
worldly, of dealing with the famine and lack of rainfall, but he
resorted to it. He continually prayed and asked for forgiveness, and
he was always keen to provide food to the Muslims, thinking of his
people, those who had come to Madeenah and those who had
remained in the desert. He dealt with the whole situation in an
efficient manner... After that he checked himself with brilliant
harshness, until those who were around him during this crisis said: "If
Allah had not lifted the famine during the year of ar-Ramidah, we
thought that 'Umar would have died out of concern for the
~nslims."~~~

5.2.2. Refugee camps during the year of ar-Ramsdah
It was narrated that Aslam said: "During the year of arR&dah, the Arabs came from all direcbons to Madeenah. 'Umar
ordered some men to look after them, and I beard him say one night:
"Count how many people ate supper with us." So they counted them
and found that there were seven thousand men. They counted the sick
men and children, and there were forty thousand ofthem. A few days
later the number of men and children reached sixty thousand. Shortly
after that, Allah sent rain, and when it rained, I saw 'Umar had
appointed men to take them back out to the desert, and he gave them
food and lambs. But death had already begun to stalk them and I
think that two-thirds of them dled. The workers would set up 'Umar's
cooking pots from the end of the night and make soup and a kind of
breadP4 'Umar divided the work up among his workers and set up
an institution to help the refugees, in which every worker knew

'Umar ibn al-Khanrib

413

exactly what he was supposed to be doing, and did not duplicate the
work assigned to someone else.725He appointed people in different
parts of Madeenah to check on the people who had gathered there to
seek food because of the severe drought and famine that had befallen
them; they would supervise the distribution of food to the people.
When evening came, they would meet with him and tell him about
what they had done, and he would give them further instructions.7z6
'Umar fed the Bedouins from D2I ad-Daqeeq, which was one
of the economic institutions that were set up at the time of 'Umar to
distribute food to those who came to Madeenah. It distributed flour,
saveeq, dates and raisins from the stores in D2I ad-Daqeeq before
supplies started to come from Egypt, Syria and Iraq. The D% adDaqeeq had expanded and was able to feed the tens of thousands who
came to Madeenah for nine months, before the rains came and people
were able to go back to
This is indicative of 'Umar's wisdom in developing the
institutions of the state, whether financial or othmise. He himself
worked in those camps. Abu Hurayrah said: "May Allah have mercy
on Ibn Hantamah (i.e., 'Umar). I saw him in the year of ar-ramgdah,
canying two sacks on his back and a container of oil in his hand,
taking turns with Aslam to carry them. When he saw me, he said:
'Where did you come from, 0' Abu Hwyrah?' I said, 'From
nearby.' I started helping him and we carried those things until we
reached Dink, where there was a group of about twenty families from
(the tribe of) Mu&ib. 'Umar said, 'What brings you here?' They
said, 'Hunger.' They brought out to us the baked skin of a dead
animal that they had been eating, and some ground up bones that they

had been eating. I saw 'Umar put down his cloak and start to cook for
them and feed them until they had eaten their fill. Then he sent Aslam
to Madeenah and he brought some camels which he gave them to ride
until he brought them to al-Jabbkah. Then he gave them some
clothes, and he kept checking on them and on others until Allah
relieved them of that drought."728
'Umar would lead the people in praying 'Ishi',then he would
go out to his house, where he would continue praying until the end of
the night, then he would go out to al-hqib and check on the people
there. 'Abdullih ibn 'Umar said: "One night I heard him at the end of
the night saying, '0' Allah, do not destroy the ummah of
Muhammad during my caliphate' and, '0' Allah, do not destroy us
by famine; relieve u s of this calamity,' and repeating these
words."729
Milik ibn Aws (£ram Banu an-Nqr) said: "In the year of arW d a h , my people came to 'Umar with one hundred families and
camped in al-Jabbhah. 'Umar would feed the people who came to
him, and he would send flour, dates and condiments to those who
could not come to him. He used to send what my people needed
month by month, and he would care for the sick among them and
send shrouds for those who died. 'Umar himself would come and
offer the funeral prayer for them, and I saw him praying for ten
people at one time. When the famine was over, he said: "Leave the
city and go back to your way of life in the desert." 'Umar gave
mounts to the weak among them, until they reached their own
land.73o

It was narrated ftom Haan ibn H i s h h that his father said: "I
saw 'Umar ibn al-KhatJ2b in the year of ar-midah passing by a
woman who was making 'weedah (a gruel made of flour with butter
and honey). He said, 'You do not make 'weedah like that.' Then he
took the spoon and said, 'Like this,' and he showed her how, saying,
'Do not put the flour in until the water is hot; add it little by little and
stir it as you are adding it, otherwise it will clump together.' One of
'Umar's wives narrated that 'Umar did not approach any of his wives
(for intimacy) duriog the time of a r - R d d a h until the famine was
over, because of his w o d 3 ' It was narrated that Anas said: "The
stomach of 'Umar ibn al-KhatJ2b rumbled during the year of arRarnzdah. He used to eat olive oil and he forbade himself ghee. He
patted his stomach and said, 'You may rumble, but we have no other
food until the famine is over.' "732

5.2.3. Seeking help from the people in other regions
'Umar hastened to write to his governors in rich lands and ask
them for help. He sent word to 'Amr ibn al-'AS, his governor in
Egypt, saying: "From the slave of Allah 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, the
Ameer al-Muinineen, to 'Amr ibn al-'Ag. Peace be upon you. Do

'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote to each of his
governors in Syria: "Send us food to help those who are with us, for
they will die unless AUah has mercy on them."735 And he wrote to
his agents in Iraq and Persia with a similar request, and they all sent
aid to him.736At-Tahari said: "The first one to come to him was Abn
'Ubaydah with four thousand camels carrying food, and he put him in
charge of distributing it to those who were around Madeenah. When
he came back to hi,he ordered that he be given four thousand
dirhams. He said, ' I have no need of it, 0'Ameer al-Mu'mineen. I
was only seeking the reward of AUah and I don't want any worldly
reward.' He said, 'Take it; there is nothing wrong with it if you were
not seeking it.' He refused, and 'Umar said, 'Take it, for I did
something similar for the Messenger of Allah @J and he said to me
what I have said to you, and I said to him what you said to me, and he
gave it to me.' So Abn 'Ubaydah accepted it and went away with the
people who had come with him."737

whatever goods are on it, and tell them to keep two garments for each
person, one for winter and one for summer, and to slaughter the
camel and store its fat and dry its meat, then let them take fat and
flour and cook them, and eat -From that until Allah brings them His
provision.' "739
'Umar started to send provision to the people month by month,
kom the food and clothing that he received fYom the other regions.
'Umar's huge cooking pots were continually tended by skilled
workers who cooked from after Fajr and then distributed the food
among the people. 'Umar announced: "If Allah does not end the
famine, then I will allocate to every household a similar number of
people and we will feed them so long as we have the means. If we
have to, then we will allocate to every family that has food the same
number of people who have no food, until Allah sends rain."740

continues, I will allocate all the hungry people to Muslim
households, for the people will not die if their stomachs are half

Come, let us pray to Allah to guide our hearts aright, to have mercy
on us and to relieve us of this drought.' 'Umar was seen that day,
raising his hands and calling upon Allah, and the people also called
upon Him. He wept and the people wept greatly, then he came
down. "743
It was narrated that Aslarn said: "I heard 'Umar say, '0'
people, I fear that this may be divine wrath that includes us all, so
seek the forgiveness of your Lord, give up sin, repent to your Lord
and do good.' "744
It was narrated that 'Abdullih ibn S2ida.h said: "I saw 'Umar
when he had prayed Maghrib he called out, '0' people, seek the
forgiveness of your Lord and repent to Him, ask Him for His bounty
and ask Him to send rain of mercy, not rain of punishment.' And he
kept on saying that until Allah granted relief ftom that."745

Abu Bakr k appointment of 'Umar as his successor

It was narrated that when 'Umar prayed for rain during the
year of ar-ramidah, at the end of his speech he said: "0' Allah, I
admit my helplessness and what is with You is more bountiful for
them." Then he took al-'Abhh by the hand and said: 'We draw close
to You by virtue of the uncle of Your Prophet, for You say and what
You say is true:
(And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town; and
there was under it a treasure belonging to them; and their father was a
righteous man...)
(Qur'an 18: 82)
You took care of them by virtue of their father's righteousness."
Then al-'Abhb said, with his eyes streaming with tears, "0' Allah,
calamity only befalls because of sin, and can only be relieved by
repentance. The people are turning to You by W e of me, because of
Our hands are stretched forth to
my relationship to Your Prophet
You (admitting) our sins and we turn to You in repentance. Send us
rain and do not make us of those who despair, 0' Most Merciful of
those who show mercy. 0' Allah, Yon are the Guardian and You do
not neglect those who are lost, and You do not forsake the weak one
in a place of doom. The young are weeping and the old are scared,
everyone is complaining to You. Yon know what is secret and what is
yet more hidden. 0' Allah, grant them Your aid before they fall into
despair and are doomed, for no one despairs of Your mercy but those
who are disbelievers."749

a).

Then a patch of cloud appeared, and the people said, "Do you
see that?" Then it grew bigger and was driven by the wind. Then the
wind dropped and it began to rain. By Allah, they did not leave until
they had to walk clinging onto the walls and pulling up their waist
wrappers. The people started saying to al-'Abbk: "Congratulations

Another report describes what al-'Abbb said in his du Z' on
this occasion: "0' Allah, calamity only befalls because of sin, and
can only be relieved by repentance. The people are turning to You by
virtue of me, because of my relationship to Your Prophet (g).
Our
hands are stretched forth to You (admitting) our sins and we turn to
You in repentance, so send us rain." Then rain started to pour down
until the land was soaked and the drought ended."750

5.2.5. Suspension of hadd punishments
during the year of famine
'Umar suspended hadd punishments for theft during the year
of a r - d d a h . This was not an abolition of the punishment, as some
have claimed. Rather it was because the conditions for carrying out
the hadd punishment were not present, so the punishment was
suspended for that reason. If a person eats something that belongs to
someone else because he is starving and cannot find food and has no
other option, he is not intending to steal as such. Hence 'Umar did not
cut off the hands of the slaves who took a camel and slaughtered it,
but he ordered their master Hgtib to pay the price of the camel?s1
'Umar said: "No hand should be cut off for (taking a bunch of dates
from) a palm tree752or when there is a famine."753The rnadh-habs
were influenced by 'Umar's fiqh and it says in al-Mughni that
A?mad said: "No hand should be cut off during a famine" means that
if a needy person steals something to eat, his hand should not be cut

off, because he is forced by necessity. Al-JawzjSmi narrated that
'Umar said: 'Wo hand should be cut off during a famine." He (alJawzjSmi) said, 'I asked Alpnad about that. I asked, 'Do you say the
same thing?' He ( m a d ) said, 'Yes indeed, I would not rule that his
hand be cut off if he was forced to do that because of need and the
people were suffering hardship and famine.' "754
This reflects 'Umax's profound understanding of the aims of shari'ah.
'Umar looked at the heart of the matter and not just at what it
appeared outwardly to be. He looked at the reason why a person
resorted to stealing and he found out that in both cases the reason was
hunger, which is regarded as one of the kinds of necessity which
temporarily make forbiddenthings allowable. This is also indicated by
what 'Umar said in the story of the slaves of Hitib: "You are using
them and making them hungry, so that if one of them eats something
that is not his (forbidden for him), it becomes permissible for him."755

5.2.6. Delaying the payment of
zakah in the year of ar-Ramgdah
'Umar (&) suspended the payment of zakah during the year
of ax-ramiklah, and when the famine ended and the land became
productive again, he collected the zakah from the year of ar-ramidah,
i.e., he regarded it as a debt owed by those who were able to pay it, so
as to help those who were in need, and so that some wealth might be
left in the bayt al-mcil after everything in it had been spent.756

It was narrated from Yahya ibn 'Abdur-Rwan ibn Hitib that
'Umar ibn al-Khagb (may Allah be pleased with him) delayed the

zakah of the year of a r - R a m W and he did not send his collectors
out. The following year, when Allah had liftedthe famine, he ordered
them to go out and collect two years' zakah. He told them to
distribute one year's worth, and to bring the other year's worth to

5.3. The plague (at-Ta'oon)
In 18 A.H.~" a terrifying event occurred, which the sources
call the plague of 'Amwk (Emmaus). It is named after a small town
called 'Amwk which is between Jerusalem and Rarnlah, because
that is the fmt place where the disease appeared. The best description
of this disease - according to my limited knowledge was given
by Ibn Hajar when he said, after quoting various opinions about the
plague: "This is what we have heard of the opinions of scholars of
Arabic language, fiqh and medicine concerning the definition of the
plague (at-?a'oon). The conclusion is that what it means is a swelling
which is caused by a disturbancein the blood, or by a rush of blood to
a limb which corrupts it. Other kinds of widespread diseases which
spread through corrupted air are also called plagues (fa 'oon) in a
metaphoric sense, because they share some similar symptoms or they
cause a large number of deaths.759The reason for this distinction
between a plague ( f a'oon) and an epidemic (waba 3 is in order to
understand correctly the hadith in which the Prophet
said that the
plague would never enter Madeenah, but epidemics may enter it and
indeed did enter it in past ~enturies.7~'
The plague appeared at that
time as the result of the huge battles between the Muslims and the

natural which Allah decrees for a rea~on.7~'

5.3.1. 'Umar's return from Sargh on the
border between al-mj2z and Syria
In 17 A.H., 'Umar wanted to visit Syria for the second time, so
he set out accompanied by the Muh6jiroon and An&, and stopped to
camp in Sargh, on the border between the Hijk and Syria. There he
was met by the leaders of the troops who told him that the land was
sick and the plague was in Syria. 'Umar consulted with the others and
decided to go back. We will discuss this in more detail when we look
at the issue of ~ h o o r a . ' ~ ~
After 'Umar left, the land was struck by the widespread plague
which was known as the plague of 'Amwk, which was at its worst in
Syria, where many people died, including Abu 'Ubaydah ibn alJam@, who was the governor, and Mu'idb ibn Jabal, Yazeed ibn Abi
Sui'iyiin, d-Hirith ibn His& (or it was said that he was martyred at
al-Yarmook), Suhayl ibn 'Amr, 'Utbah ibn Suhayl and the leaders of
the people. The epidemic did not end until after 'Amr ibn a&'& (may
Allah be pleased with him) became their governor. He addressed the
people and said: "0' people, this disease which has befallen you
spreads like wildfire, so escape &om it in the mountains." So he left
and the people left, and they scattered until Allah relieved them of
that. 'Umar heard of what 'Amr had done and he did not object to

5.3.2. The death of Abu 'Ubaydah
(may Allah be pleased with him)
When the plague spread and news of that reached 'Umar (&),
he wrote to Ahu 'Ubaydah telling him to come out of that l&d,
saying: 'T'eace be upon you. There is something I want to discuss
with you and I urge you once you read this letter not to put it down
until you come to me." Abu 'Ubaydah (4)
realized that 'Umar
wanted to bring h i away from the plague out of compassion for him
and to save his life, and he said: "May Allah forgive the Ameer alMu'mineen." Then he wrote to him, saymg: "0' Ameer alMu'mineen, I understand what you said, but I am with some of the
Muslim troops and I do not want to save myself and leave them until
Allah passes His decree concerning me and them. Please excuse me
from coming, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, and let me be with my
troops." When 'Umar read the letter he wept, and the people said:
"0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, has Abu 'Ubaydah died?" He said, "It is
as if he has." Then he wrote to him and said: "F'eace be upon you.
You have camped with the people in land that is low-lying; take them
up into high land where there is fresh air." When his letter arrived, he
called Abu Moosa and said: "0' Abu Moosa, this letter has come to
me from the Ameer al-Mu 'mineenwith what you see. Go out and find
a place for the people to camp so I can follow you with them." Abu
Moosa went back to his camp and found that his wife had caught the
sichmess. He went back to (Abu 'Ubaydah) and told him the news. He
ordered that a camel be prepared for him and when he put his foot in
the stirrup he realized that be had become infected too. He said: "By
Allah, the Exalted, the Almighty, I have caught it."764
It was narrated that 'Urwah said: "Abu 'Ubaydah and his
family were free of the disease of 'Amwik, then he said: '0' AUah,

426

Abu B a b k appointment of 'Umar as his successor

send a share upon the family of Abu 'Ubaydah.' Then pustules broke
out on his skin and he started looking at them. Someone said, 'It is
nothing.' He said, 'I hope that Allah will bless them.'"765
Before he was stricken, he stood and addressed the people,
saying: "0' people, this disease is a mercy from your Lord and a
response to the du '6' of your Prophet @), and it is the way some of
the righteous died."
Abu 'Ubaydah asked Allah to give h i his share of it766,and
when he caught it, he called the Muslims and they came to see him,
and he said to them: "I will give you some advice which, if you
accept it, you will be fine so long as you live and after you die:
establish regular prayer, pay zakah, fast, give in charity, perform Hajj
and 'Umrah, uphold ties with one another, love one another, be
sincere to your rulers and do not deceive them, and do not be
distracted by this world. If man lived to be a thousand years old, he
would still end up as I am now (i.e., dying). Allah has decreed death
for the sons of Adam and they will surely die. The cleverest among
them is the one who is most obedient to his Lord and who strives
hardest for his Hereafter." Then he said to Mu'idh ihn Jabal, '0'
Mu'idh, lead the people in prayer.' So Mu'&& led them in prayer
and Ahu 'Ubaydah died (may Allah have mercy on him and forgive
him and be pleased with him)."767
Mu'idh stood up and addressed the people: "0' people, repent
to Allah sincerely, for if a person meets AUah repenting from his sins,
it will be incumbent upon Allah to forgive him his sins. Whoever
owes a debt, let him pay it off, for a person is in pledge for his debt.
Whoever among you is forsaking a Muslim, let him meet him and

'Umaribn al-Khattrfb

427

reconcile with him, and shake hands with him, for no Muslim should
forsake his fellow Muslim for more than three days. The sin involved
in that is serious before Allah. You Muslims are stricken with the loss
of a man. By Allah, I do not think that I have seen any of you, 0'
slaves of Allah, who is more humble, more honest, more removed
from treachery, more sincere towards the public and more
compassionate towards them than him. Pray for mercy for him and
attend his funeral prayer. May Allah forgive him all his sins. By
Allah, no one l i e him will ever be appointed over you again." The
people gathered, and Abu 'Ubaydah was brought out, and Mu'$&
led the funeral prayer for him. When he was brought to his grave,
Mu'&, 'Amr ibn al-'AS and ad-Da&* ibn Qays entered his grave.
When they covered him with earth, Muc$& said: "May Allah have
mercy on you, 0' Abu 'Ubaydah. By Allah I will praise him for what
I know of him and by Allah I shall not say anything false, fearing lest
I incur the wrath of Allah. By Allah, as far as I know, you were one of
those who remember Allah a great deal, one of those,

By Allah, as far as I know, you were one of those who turn to Allah a
great deal in humility, one of those who show mercy to the orphans

and the poor, and who hate the harsh and arrogant."768
No one among the people was more upset or more grieved at
the loss of Abu 'Ubaydah that ~ u ' i d h . 7Mu'idh
~ ~ wrote to 'Umar
(&) and told him of the death of Abu 'Ubaydah. It said in the letter:
"Seek reward for the loss of a man who was sincere towards Allah
and had a great fear of Allah in his heart. He was dear to us and to
you, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen: Abu 'Ubaydah ibn al-Jadh, may
Allah forgive him all his sins. Truly, to Allah we belong and truly, to
Him we shall return. We seek reward for his loss with Allah, and we
put our trust in Allah. I have written to you when death is widespread
and there is this epidemic among the people. No one will ever miss
his appointment with death. Whoever has not yet died will surely die
one day. May Allah make what is with Him better for him than this
world. Whether we live or we die, may Allah reward you on behalf of
the Muslims, on behalf of our elite and our common folk, and bestow
His mercy, His forgiveness, His pleasure and His Paradise. Peace be
upon you, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings."770
When the letter reached 'Umar, he read it and wept greatly, and
announced the death of Abu 'Ubaydah to those who were sitting with
l1im.7~' The people wept and grieved greatly, whilst accepting the
will and decree of Allah.

Shortly thereafter he died (may Allah have mercy on him) and
Mu'& offered the funeral prayer for him and bwied him. When

intense. His companions started visiting him and when they came to

When he died he was 38 years old.776He appointed 'Amr ibn
al-'As to take over his position after he died. 'Amr offered the funeral
prayer for him, and entered his grave and placed him in the lahd.
Some other Muslim men also entered the grave with hi. When
'Amr came out ofthe grave, he said: "May Allah have mercy on you,
0' Mu'Xh. As far as we know, you were among the most sincere of
the Muslims and one of the best of them. You taught the ignorant,
were harsh with evildoers and compassionate towards the
believers."777
After the death of Abu 'Ubaydah and Mu'Xh ibn Jabal, the
leadership of the army went to 'Amr ibn al-'As. He stood up and
addressed the people, saying: "0' people, this disease when it befalls
spreads like wild&, so escape fiom it in the mountains." So he left
and the people left, and they scattered until Allah relieved them of
that.778

'Amr ibn al-'& wrote to 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b and said to
him: "Peace be upon you. I praise Allah besides Whom there is no
other god. Mu'idh ibn Jabal (may Allah have mercy on him) has
died, and death is widespread among the Muslims. They have asked
me for permission to move to the open countryside. I know that

When the letter of 'Amr ibn a]-'& reached 'Umar with news
of the death of M u ' m , who died straight after Abu 'Ubaydah, he
was very distressed. 'Umar and the Muslims wept and grieved for
him a great deal. 'Umar
said: "May Allah have mercy on
Mu'idh, for by his death this ummah has lost a great deal of
knowledge. How many times did he offer sincere advice and we
accepted it fiom him, and we saw how it brought goodness and
blessings. How many times did we learn something ftom him and
benefit ftom it, and he guided us to something good. May AUah
reward him with the reward of the righteous."780

The third famous leader who was stricken with the plague was
the best of the sons of Abu Sufiyh, who was known as Yazeed alKhayr. His name was Yazeed ibn Abi Sufiyk. Another of the great
leaders who were martyred during the plague of 'Amw2s was
Shurahbeel ibn ~asanah.7"

5.3.4. 'Umar's journey to Syria
to set i t s affairs in order
'Umar was deeply affected with grief at the death of his great
leaders and courageous troops because of the plague in Syria. He
received letters ftom the governors in Syria asking him about the
inheritances that had been left behind by the dead, and about
numerous other matters. He gathered the people together and

432

Abu Bakr h appointment of 'Umar as his successor

consulted them about the new matters that had arisen, and he
resolved to go to the Muslims in their own lands and organize their
affairs. After discussing the matter with his majlis ash-shoora, he
decided to start with Syria. He said: "The inheritances of the people
of Syria have been neglected, so I will start with Syria; I will divide
the inheritances and I will sort out their affairs as I see fit. Then I will
come back and make a tour of other countries and give them my
orders." So he departed kom Madeenah, where he left 'Ali ibn Abi
Tglib in-charge in his absence?" When he came to Syria, he shared
out the provisions and formed battalions to go on campaigns in the
winter and in the summer, and he organized the defence of the
borders. He also appointed governors. He appointed 'Abdulliih ibn
Qays over the coastal area and MuC2wiyahover Damascus. He
organized the affairs of the army, leaders and people, and divided the
estates of the dead among the living.783
When the time for prayer came, the people said to him. "Why
don't you tell Bil2l to give the adhin?" So he told him and he gave
the a d h i n . There was no one who had met the Prophet
but he
wept when Bil2l gave the adhrin until his beard became wet, and
'Umar wept more than any of them. And those who had not met the
Prophet &) wept because of their weeping and their remembering
the Messenger of Allah M)?'~

Before he went back to Madeenah, he addressed the people
and said: "I have been appointed over you and insha ' Allih I have
done my best with regard to what Allah has appointed me to do
concerning your affairs. We have divided your provision amongst

this khutbah was given before the prayer mentioned above.
The plague of 'Amwb was a serious threat to the Muslims. It
killed more than twenty thousand of them, which was almost half of
their number in Syria. The Muslims sensed the danger that this
formed with regard to the Byzantines, for had the Byzantines realized
the drop in numbers in the Muslim army in Syria, they would have
attacked, because it would have been too dificult for the army to
defend it. But perhaps the despair that the Byzantines themselves felt
prevented them from attacking the Muslims, especially since the
local people accepted Muslim rule and were content with their just
rule and good conduct. Without their help the Byzantines could not
a m k Syria, especially since the people were tired of war and wanted
a rest from their long fight against a people (the Arabs) who had
victory on their side and fear of whom was fumly entrenched in the
heart of every man.786

Abu Bakr k appointment of 'Umar as his successor

The scholars differed concerning the meaning of this
prohibition on leaving and entering such lands. Some of them took it
at face value, and some interpreted it in different ways. Those who
interpreted it in different ways said that it was permissible for one
whose land had been struck by the plague to leave. We have pointed
out above how keen 'Umar was to bring Abu 'Ubaydah out of the
land that had been struck by the plague, hut Abu 'Ubaydah
apologized and stayed there. Then 'Umar asked Abu 'Ubaydah to
take the Muslims fi-om the low-lying land where there was a lot of
water and swamps, and go to high land where there was fi-esh air,
which Abu 'Ubaydah did. 'Umar's letter to Abu 'Ubaydah came after
the two had met in Sargh and had heard the hadith of 'Abdur--in
ibn 'Awf about it not being permitted to leave or enter a land where
there was an epidemic.
'Umar went hack to Madeenah, and it seems that the epidemic
was just begian'mg and had not yet begun to spread like wildfire.
When 'Umar came back to Madeenah news reached him of the large
number of deaths in this plague. 'Umar's view that it was permissible
to leave a land that had been struck with the plague was also narrated
&om other Sahdbah who lived through the same sickness at the time
of Abu 'Ubaydah in Syria, such as 'Amr ibn al-'As and Ahu Moosa
al-Ash'ari (may Allah be pleased with them both).
The dispute had to do with leaving a land that had been struck
with the plague, not about entering such a land. Some of them said
that it is permissible to leave so long as one is not trying to flee &om
the decree of Allah or believes that fleeing is what will save one from
death. As for the one who leaves for a specific reason, this is
permissible. If a pbson leaves to seek medical treatment, that is
permissible. If he leaves the plagued land to go to a land that is better,
that is recommended and is required of him.

'Umar ibn al-Kha?t&b

435

As for Abu 'Uhaydah's staying where he was and offering
excuses to 'Umar for not leaving, this was for health, social, political
and leadership reasons that give an example of the highest forms of
sincere leadership. Abu 'Ubaydah explained his reasons for staying:
"I am with some of the M u s h troops and I do not want to save
myself and leave them." The scholars explained the reason for the
prohibition on fleeing kom the plague by noting that if everyone left,
those who were unable to flee
because they were sick with this
disease or something else w o u l d be in a bad situation, with no one
to take care of them in life or in death. If it were permissible to leave,
the strong would leave and this would cause great distress to the
weak. They said that the reason for the stem waming against fleeing
kom the battlefield was the great distress that it would cause to those
who did not flee, and it would make them feel scared because others
had let them down.
-

Conclusion
Staying is a concession, and leaving is a concession. If a
person is in a land where there is an epidemic and he has been
infected, there is no point in his leaving, because by leaving he will
transmit the disease to healthy people. Whoever has not been infected
is allowed to leave in order to seek medical help, so long as not all the
people leave, because some of them must stay behind to tend the

Financial and Judiciary Institutions
and Their Development at the
Time of 'Umar (&)
1. Financial Institutions

%e
Muslims at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs
regarded wealth in all forms and of all types as belonging to Allah,
and they believed that man was entrusted with it and was to dispose
of it in accordance with the conditions stipulated by Allah. The
Qur'an confirms this with regard to everything that has to do with
wealth and spending it. AUah (&) says:
(Believe in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad], and spend of
(Qur'an 57: 7)
that whereof He has made you trustees...8

40' you who believe! Spend of that with which We have provided for
you ... 8
(Qur'an 2: 254)
And Allah, the Exalted, Almighty says concerning righteousness (albirr), which incorporates all kinds of goodness:
(... And gives his wealth, in spite of love for it, to the kinsfolk, to the
orphans, and to al-Masken [the poor], and to the wayfarer, and to

those who ask, and to set slaves kee...b

(Qur'an 2: 177)

Giving wealth in charity is an acknowledgement kom the
Muslim, first and foremost, that the wealth which he has in his hands
is provision that Allah has granted to him:
(And in the heaven is your provision, and that which you are
promised.8
(Qur'an 51: 22)
-because Allah, the Almighty has created it. From the basis of this
acknowledgement comes the idea of being kind to the slaves of
~llah.'
It was on the basis of this faith-based thinking that 'Umar
looked at the wealth of the state which increased greatly during his
reign, as many lands were conquered and many people submitted to
the rule of the Islamic state. He organized the relations between the
state and these peoples. Some of them had come under the rule of the
state willingly, afier making a peaceful deal, and others had come
under its rule by force, when the land that was conquered by force
ended up under the control of the state. In some cases he made a deal
with the owners of the land, where the owners had left it and
retreated, or when it had belonged to the former rnlers and their men.
Some of the peoples of these lands were people of the Book (such as
Jews and Christians), and 'Umar worked out a way to deal with them
in accordance with the wise laws of Allah.
'Umar started to organize the financial affairs of his state,
whether it had to do with income, expenditure, or organizing the
people's dues under different departments. The state income began to
increase during 'Umar's reign so he started to develop it and
appointed workers to supervise it. The most important sources of
income at this time were zakah, war booty, al-fay jizyah, kharij and

:

'Umar ibn al-Khagtb

439

the tithes ( 'whoor) paid by merchants. 'Umar strove to develop these
sources and he issued rulings on the basis of the aims of shari'ah
which were laid down for the people's benefit. New circumstances
arose that had been unknown at the time of the Messenger of Allah
(gj)
2, but 'Umar implemented the Qur'an and Sunnah in a brilliant
fashion; he did not decide on any matter without consulting the
Muslims, and he did not force his own opinion in any matter. If a
matter arose, he would order the Muslims to gather so that he could
consult them, and he would follow their views.3
The most important sources of income at the time of 'Umar were:

1.1.1. Zakah
This is the social component of the pillars of Islam, and the
fmt divine decree of Islam. It is enjoined upon the wealth of the rich
Muslims, to be taken from them and given to the poor, based on set
thresholds on crops, fruits, gold and silver, trade goods and livestock,
in order to establish a kind of social security and to create love
between the rich and poor. Zakah is a duty that has to do with wealth,
and as the saying goes, money makes the world go around (i.e., it is
an essential part of life). Some people are blessed because of wealth
and some are doomed because of it. This is the way of Allah with
regard to His creation, and you will not find any change in the way of
Allah (cf. Qur'an 33: 62).
As wealth has a great impact on people's lives, Islam paid a
great deal of attention to the issue ofwealth, and established zakah as
a precise, wise and compassionate system which brings hearts

and Abu Bakr, and organized and developed the
institution of zakah. He sent collectors to gather the zakah kom all
regions of the I s l m c state, after many of the inhabitants of the
conquered lands became Muslim. Justice in collecting wealth was the
hallmark of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate, without that causing any
detriment to the bayt al-mil or treasury. 'Umar criticized one of his
zakah-collectors who took a sheep with huge udders, and said: "Its
owners did not give it willingly. Do not cause distress to the
people."s
Some people &om Syria came to 'Umar and said: "We have
wealth, horses and slaves, and we want to give zakah kom them to
purify our wealth." 'Umar said: "What my two companions dld
before me, I will also do." He consulted the Companions of the
Messenger of Allah @), among whom was 'Ali. 'Ali said: "It is
good, so long as it is not something to be taken regularly fiom them
after
Dr. Akram Diya' al-'Umari stated that the Sahibah suggested
to 'Umar that he impose zakah on slaves and horses after ownership
of slaves and horses became widespread among the Muslims. 'Umar
regarded slaves and horses as trade goods and he imposed one dinir
(ten dirhams) on slaves, young and old. He imposed ten dirhams on
Arabian horses and five dirhams on non-Arabian horses. It may be
understood that he did not impose zakah on slaves who were used as
servants or horses that were used for jihad, because these were not
trade goods, rather he compensated those who had paid zakah on
them by giving them approximately 209 kg of wheat every two
months, which was worth more than the zakah. This was because of

'Umar took one fifth f?om busied treasure when it was found.
He was also keen to circulate wealth and ensure that it was used or
invested, lest zakah consume it as time went by.'

He had wealth for an orphan which he gave to al-Hakam ibn
al-'A$ ah-Thaqafi to engage in trade9, because 'Umar did not have
time to engage in trade as he was so busy with the affairs of state.
When the profit rose f?om ten thousand dirhams to one hundred
thousand, 'Umar got suspicious. When he found out that the
merchant has used the orphan's connection to 'Umar he rejected the
entire profit and restored the capital, because he regarded the profit as
ill-gotten gains.10 He was acting on the same principle that he
imposed on his governors, which was the rejection of any abuse of
positions of responsibility when working for the state. Hence if the
governors made a great deal of wealth in business, he would take a

the Sunnah. He would urge kindness to the owners of gardens and
orchards when estimating the yield of dates.13 He took &ah of onetenth on honey if the state protected the bees' area for the investor.14
Supplies of wheat increased during his caliphate, so he
allowed the people to give z a E t al-fir in the form of wheat, giving
half of the weight of barley, dates or raisins that they used to give
before.I5 This was done to make things easier for the people, and to
accept better quality wealth, even if it was of a different type.16

As for the amount of wealth that was collected in zakah each
year, that is not known, and the reports that mention some figures
give only partial and imprecise details; it is not possible to get the full
picture. It was said that 'Umar ibn a l - K h a ~ protected
b
the land of arRabdhah for the zakah herds (camels and horses given as zakah), and
he used to use them in jihad for the sake of Allah. The number of
mounts used each year in jihad for the sake of Allah was forty
tho~sand.'~
With regard to the people who were employed to supervisethis
institution, the sources mention the names of a number of them
during the caliphate of 'Umar. They were: Anas ibn M2ik, Sa'eed

Jizyah is a tax which is imposed on the individuals from
among the People of the Book who come under the protection of the
~ u s l i m s .It' ~has also been suggested that it is apoll tax levied on the
kuffir as a form of humiliation or to make them feel subduedz0,
because Allah (g)says:

dFight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day,
nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His
Messenger wnhammad], and those who acknowledge not the
religion of trnth [i.e. Islam] among the people of the Scripture [Jews
and Christians], until they pay the Jizyah with willing submission,
(Qur'an 9. 29)
and feel themselves subdued.),
The jizyah was levied on the people of the Book, namely the
Jews and Christians; there is scholarly consensus on the fact that they
are people of the Book and there is no dispute on this point. The
jizyah was also levied on a people who may have had a Book
originally, namely the Magians (Zoroastrians). 'Urnar was confused
about them at first, and was uncertain whether to take thejizyah from
them or not, until ' A b d w - e % n ibn 'Awf resolved the matter by
narrating that the Messenger of Allah @) had taken the jizyah from
the Magians of ~ajar?'
Ibn Abi Shaybah and others narrated that 'Umar was between
the Prophet's grave and the minbar, and he said: 'I do not know what
to do with the Magians, for they are not people of the Book." 'AbdwRalpn%nibn 'Awfsaid that he heard the Messenger of Allah &,) say:

of Allah
had taken it from the Magians of ~ a j a r . 'The
~ scholars
explained that the reason why it was taken from the Magians was that
they were originally people of a Book, and they only started to
worship fire after that. So 'Umar took the jizyah from the people of
as-Saws (the regions between the two rivers in Iraq) and he took it
kom the Magians in Persia. He wrote to Juz' ibn Mu'gwiyah saying:
"Look at the Magians around you and take thejizyah from them, for
'Abdur-Rwan ibn 'Awf told me that the Messenger of AUah
took it from the Magians of ~ a j a r . " ' ~

a)

Jizyah is obligatory upon free men of sound mind, hut it is not
obligatory upon women, children, the insane or slaves, because they
are followers and dependents. Also, thejizyah is not to be taken from
the poor to whom charity is given, or from the paralyzed. If a
paralyzed or chronically-sick person can afford it, it may be taken
from him. The same also applies to the blind and monks in the
monasteries, if they can afford it, it may be taken from them, but if
they are poor and receive charity from others who are better off, then
the jizyah is not taken from them.25

Thejizyah is no longer payable if a person dies, because it is a
levy that is paid per person, and if the person is no longer there
because he has died, it is no longer due. If a person who is obliged to
payjizyah becomes a Muslim, then he no longer has to pay thej j a h
because of his becoming Muslim. Two men from Ullyas became

Muslim, and the jizyah was waived for them.26 Ar-Raqeel, the
chieftain of an-Nahrayn, became Muslim and 'Umar allocated a
stipend of two thousand for him, and waived the j ~ a h . ' ~
It is worth noting that thejizyah was waived for the whole year
in which a dhimmi became a Muslim, whether he became Muslim at
the beginning of the year, in the middle or at the end. 'Umar said: "If
a collector takes the j j a h in his hand, then the person who paid it
becomes Muslim, it should be returned to him."**
It is also waved if a person becomes poor. If a dhimmi become
poor after having been rich, and he becomes unable to pay thejizyah,
it is waived in his case. 'Umar waived thejizyah for an old blind man
whom he saw begging from peoplezg,and he allocated to him some
money from the bayt a l - m i l to help him survive.
Thejizyah is also waived if the state becomes unable to protect
the dhimmis, because thej i q a h is a tax that is levied on people living
in the Islamic state which is paid in return for their benefiting from
the public services and protection of the state, and because they do
not bear the responsibility of defending the state.30
Among the evidence that the jizynh is paid in return for
protection is what Abu 'Ubaydah ibn a l - J m did when the
Byzantines massed on the northem border of the Muslim lands. Abu
'Ubaydah wrote to the governors whom he had appointed in each city
with whose people he had a treaty, telling them to give back to the
people the jizyah and kharej that they had collected from them. He

wrote to them telling them to say to them: "We are returning your
wealth to you because we have heard that the armies are massing.
You stipulated to us that we should protect you, but we are not able to
do that, so we are returning to you what we took from you, for we are
bound by our conditions. Whatever deal we wrote between us will
remain in force when Allah grants us victory." When they told them
that and returned to them the money that they had collected from
them, they said: "May Allah bring you back to us and grant you
victory over them (i.e., the Byzantines), for if it had been them, they
would not have returned anytbing to us. They would have taken
everything we bad left and would not have left anything for us."31
Thejiqvah was also waived if the dhimmis themselves took on
the burden of defence at the request of the state, as happened in the
treaty which S6qa.h ibn 'Amr drew up with the people of
Tabaristh, after 'Umar agreed to that?2
With regard to the value of the jizyah, it is not fixed, and it
varies &om one region to another, according to the people's ability to
pay and the circumstances in each region. The rate for the people of
as-SawX (in Iraq) varied between forty-eight and twenty-four
dirhams, depending on what each person could afford. That was
taken from them each year, and if they brought something other than
value in
money that was accepted from them; the-ivalent
livestock, goods, etc. would be accepted from them?3
For tbepeople of Syria the rate was four dincirs, plus supplying
the Muslims with two mudds of wheat and three measures of olive oil
for each individual. For those who paid in silver, the rate was forty

reached the age of puberty, unless he was poor?4
The people of Yemen had submitted to Islam during the time
and thejizyah had been imposed on every man at
of the Prophet
the rate of one dincir or its equivalent in garments. Some weak reports
indicate that this jizyah remained in effect during 'Umar's caliphate
and was not changed despite their weakness. This is in accordance
with 'Umar's policy of paying attention to the people's situation and
not changing what the Prophet (Blessings and peace be upon h i )
had decided.35

a),

The jizyah varied according to what the people could afford
and according to the region's wealth. It was to be decided withim the
framework of people's ability to pay, without burdening them or
causing any harm to them?6
'Umar commanded his collectors to be kind to the people
when collecting it. When a great deal ofwealth was brought to 'Umar
he said: "I think that you have destroyed the people." They said, "No,
by AUah. We have not taken anything that was not given with full
permission and willingly." He said: "With no force or coercion?"
They said, "That is so." He said: "Praise be to Allah Who has not
caused any force or coercion to happen at my hands or by my
authority.."37
Among the most well known people who were employed in
this institution were 'Uthmiiu ibn Haneef and Sa'eed ibn Hudhaym,

and the governors of regions such as 'Amr ibn d-'AS,Mu'iwiyah ibn
Abi Sufiyin and others.
The jiqah was regulated by a number of rulings and laws
which thejiqaha' derived kom the texts of the Qur'an and Sunnah
and the actions of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. These rulings indicate
that the institution ofjiqah was one of the sources of income for the
Islamic state. It also played a political role. The fact that ah1 adhdhimmah were making a payment to the state was indicative of their
sincerity towards it and their submission to its rulings and laws, and
their adherence to the terms of their treaty.38 Professor Hasan dMimmi is of the view that the institution ofjizyah was more political
than financial in nature.39 In fact this institution combined both
elements, and was one of the sources of income for the Islamic state.

' U m r took double the zakah from the Christians of Tagklib
Some of the Arabs of the Peninsula were Christians, and
refused to pay the jiqah because they thought it was insulting and a
source of shame. Al-Waleed sent the Christian chiefs and scholars to
'Umar and he said to them: "Pay the jizyah." They said to 'Umar,
"Grant us safety and security, for by Allah, if you impose the jizyah
we will go to the land of the Byzantmes. By Allah, you are going to
shame us among the Arabs." He said to them, "You have shamed
yourselves and gone against your nation llke other Arab tribes who
went against their nation and shamed themselves. By Allah, you will
pay it with humiliation. If you flee to the Byzantines, I will write to
my governor and tell him to take you captive." They said, "Take
something from us, but do not call itjiqah." He said, "We will call it
jizyah; you can call it whatever you want." 'Ali ibn Abi p l i b (&)
said to him, "0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen, didn't Sa'd ibn M i l k double

449

the zakah for them?" He said, "Yes." So he listened to him and
accepted that (double zakah) from them instead of the jizy~h.~'
From this report we can learn a lesson about how to deal with
arrogant enemies who address the Muslims with pride and arrogance,
and threaten to go and join the krifir state. We see how 'Umar dealt
with them harshly and disdainfully; he threatened that if they went to
join the kuflir, he would strive to bring them back and treat them like
enemy combatants, taking their women and children captive, which
would be worse for them than paying the jizyah. This forceful
response dispelled the pride and arrogance £tom their minds, and they
became humble and asked the caliph to agree to take whatever he
wanted without calling itjizyah. At this point 'Ali intervened, and his
opinion canied weight with 'Umar because of his understanding of
Islam. He suggested that he double the zakah for them as Sa'd ibn
Abi WaqqQ had done with others like them, and 'Umar accepted that
in order to soften their hearts and to stop them attempting to go and
join the ka^firs. This opinion was accepted as it was suggested at the
right time, which was after 'Umar had removed the pride and
arrogance that was in their hearts. But if he had accepted that at the
beginning, they would have remained arrogant and there would have
been no guarantee that they would not break the treaty later on and
mistreat the ~ u s l i m s . ~ ~
In the story of Banu Taghlib we also learn that they were called
to Islam and they refused, then they were called to pay thejizyah and
they did not agree to that and they ran away, aiming to join the
Byzantines. An-Nu'min ibn Zar'ah said to 'Umar: "0' Ameer alMu'mineen, Banu Taghlib are an Arab people; they are too proud to

pay thejizyah, and they do not have any wealth, they are just farmers
and herders, but they are tough fighters. Do not help your enemy
against you by means of them." So 'Umar ibn al-Khagib (&)
worked out an agreement whereby they would pay double zakah4',
and he said, "This is a jizyah; you may call it whatever you like."43
Banu Taghlib said, "So long as it is not ajizyah like thejizyah of the
non-Arabs, then we will accept it and keep our religion."44
As for the reason why 'Umar (&,) agreed to accept the zakah
fiom Banu Taghlib, and whether it was regarded as zakah orjizyah, it
goes back to whether the naming of a tbing can be compromised. The
caliph agreed to it so long as it served the public interest. What
motivated him to do that was the fear that Banu Taghlib might join
the Byzantines and the hope that they might become Muslim and
help the Muslims against their enemies. These were Arab people who
had a sense of pride, which justified maintaining their dignity. The
wealth that would come kom them was better for the Muslims and
the bayt al-mi1 than their running away and joining the ranks of the
~~zantines.~~
As for whether it was zakah orjizyah: it wasjizyah, because it
was to be disposed of like kharij, whereas zakah is not imposed on
non-Muslims. Moreover,jizyah is given in return for protection, and
Banu Taghlib were under the protection of the Muslims. But at the
same time, we can say that it was not jizyah in a practical sense,
because what was imposed on the Christians of Banu Taghlib was
imposed on the same things on which zakah is imposed. For
evetythmg on which the Muslims are obliged to pay zakah, crops,

fruits, livestock and gold and silver, they were required to pay
double, and it was imposed on women as well as men, and it was not
imposed on an individual basis. This is different from jizyah in the
usual sense?=
What matters is that in either case, whether it is regarded as
zakah orjizyah, it was a tax which demonstrated their submission to
Islamic ru1e.4~
There were also other taxes and obligations that the Muslims
imposed on the conquered lands besides the jizyah, which were
developed further dnring the caliphate of 'Umar. These included
offering hospitality when envoys and ambassadors or other Muslims
came and visited the land. The limit set for hospitality during 'Umar's
caliphate was three days, offering what they ordinarily ate, and not
going to the trouble of slaughtering a sheep or a chicken or offering
anything they could not afford.48
When we looked at inhtructure development at the time of
'Umar, we mentioned some of the agreements which included
maintaining the roads, building bridges and constructing waterways.
The system ofjizyah was developed further during 'Umar's reign. IIe
took a census, in which a distinction was made between the rich, the
poor and those who were of average means. He introduced many
conditions and obligations in the texts of the treaties which had not
been known before. That was because of the spread of development
and the spread of Islamic rule to Egypt, Syria and Iraq, and because
the Muslims were mixlug with the people of those lands and had
ongoing contact with their culture, which enabled them to run the
affairs of state and develop the inhstructure in a gradual manner.

452

They introduced new conditions to the peace deals that had not
existed before, such as maintaining roads and building bridges,
which are things that help developed nations. Hence affairs were put
in order and the principles of running financial and other affairs were
set up.49

Conditions of the jizyah contract and w k n it was to be paid
From the era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, the fuqaha'
derived a number of such conditions:
+:* They should not refer to the Book of Allah with any criticism or
distortion
*:* They should not mention the Messenger of Allah

a)in terms of

rejection or disbelief
*:* They should not mention the religion of Islam with any criticism

or insult
O They should not have relations with any Muslim woman by way
of zini or in the name of marriage

*:* They should not tempt a Muslim away fi-om his religion or harm

him financially or cause him annoyance because of his religion
They should not help those who are at war against the
With regard to the time when it should be paid, the caliph
'Umar stipulated that thejizyah should be paid at the end of the year,
meaning the end of the agricultural year. This change in the time for
paying the jizyah, which was introduced during 'Umar's caliphate,
came about because of increased stability, which in turn requires
organization and selection of a time that was suited both to the state

and to those who were obliged to pay the jiqah. Collecting it at the
time of the harvest, which the historiaus describe as the end of the
year, was a way of warding off hardship as well as making it easier
for those who were paying it?'

Kharij has two meanings. In the general sense it refers to any
income that comes to the bayt al-mil of the Muslims fiom sources
other than zakah. So it comes under the general heading offay' and
includes the income fiom jizyah, 'ushoor (tithes) etc. And it has a
specific meaning, which is the income fiom the lands that the
Muslims had conquered by force, which the mler had then left to eam
an income for the Muslims in perpetuity, as 'Umar did with the land
of as-SawZd in Iraq and ~yria?' Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali said: "Kharij
is not based on the value of the land or the income fiom the rent,
rather it is not based on the land itself."53
When Islam grew strong through conquests, especially a€€er
the defeat of the two "superpowers" of Persia and Byzantium, the
sources of income of the Islamic state increased, as did its
expenditure. In order to maintain the integrity of this far-flung state
and to protect its authority and guarantee its people's interests, both
private and public, it was essential to have a wise, sensible financial
policy. 'Umarthoughtthat the way to achieve that was to have a fixed
and regular income that could be spent on all these aims, and that
income was the kharij. The conquerors wanted to divide the booty of
wealth and land among themselves according to what is mentioned in
the Qur'an about booty:

$And know that whatever of war-booty that you may gain, verily,
one-fifth [1/5th] of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and
to the near relatives [of the Messenger (Muhammad)], [and also] the
orphans, al-Masiken [the poor] and the wayfarer, if you have
believed in Allah and in that which We sent down to Our slave
[Muhammad] on the Day of Criterion [between right and wrong], the
Day when the two forces met [the battle of Badr]; and Allah is Able
(Qur'an 8: 41)
to do all things.)
At k t 'Umar wanted to divide the land among the conquerors, but
'Ali ibn Abi Tklib (&) thought that it should not be divided. Mu'kdh
ibn Jabal agreed with him and warned 'Umar against doing that. Abu
'Ubayd narrated that 'Umar came to al-Jiibiyah and wanted to divide
the land among the Muslims, but Mu'=
sad: "By AUah, the
consequences of that will not be good, for if you divide it, all these
lands will come under the people's control but eventually it will end
up in the hands of one man or one woman. Then after them there will
come people who will engage in a great deal of jihad, but they will
not find anything (because all the land will already have been
conquered - their jihad will be in self-defence). So thlnk of
something that will benefit all the Muslims, now and later on"54
Thus Mu'= drew 'Umar's attention to an important matter,
and 'Umar started to study the verses of the Qur'an and ponder the
meaning of each word he read, until he came to the verses in Soorah
o l - m h r which speak about the divislon of fay'. Then it became
clear to him that they were referring to thef q ' of the Muslims at that
time and for those who came after them. So he decided to follow
Mu'm's view. News of that spread among the people and a dispute
arose between hun and some of the Sahibah (may AUah be pleased
with them); 'Umar and h s supporters did not think that the
54 AI-Amwdl

by Abu 'Ubayd, p. 75; Siy&ah al-Mil, p. 103

'Umar ibn al-Khattrfb

455

conquered lands should be divided, but some of the Sahibah including Bila ibn R a b a and az-Zubayr ibn 'Awwh, thought that it
should be divided, as war booty was divided and as the Prophet &)
had divided Khaybar. But 'Umar refused to divide it and he recited
the verse of al-khums in Soorah al-Hashr to them:
(And what Allah gave as booty [Fayl to His Messenger
[Muhammad] from them - for this you made no expedition with
either cavalry or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Messengers
over whomsoever He wills. And Allah is Able to do all things.),
(Qur'an 59. 6)
This refers to Banu an-Nadeer. Then Allah ( B )said:
(What Allah gave as booty [Fay7 to His Messenger Muhammad]
from the people of the townships - it is for Allah, His Messenger
Muhammad], the kindred [of Messenger Muhammad], the orphans,
al-Masakeen [the poor], and the wayfarer, in order that it may not
become a fortnne used by the rich among you. And whatsoever the
Messenger [Muhammad] gives you, take it; and whatsoever he
forbids you, abstain [from it]. And fear Allah; verily, Allah is Severe
(Qur'an 59. 7)
in punishment.)
This is general and applies to all the townships. Then Allah said:
([And there is also a share in this booty] for the poor emigrants, who
were expelled from their homes and their property, seeking Bounties
from Allah and to please H i , and helping Allah [i.e. helping His
religion -Islamic Monotheism] and His Messenger [Muhammad].
Such are indeed the truthful [to what they say].) (Qur'an 59. 8)
The passage did not stop there, rather Allah mentions others
who may also benefit from the booty:
(And [it is also for] those who, before them, had homes [in

456

Financial and Judiciary Institutions at the 7ime of 'Umar

Madeenah] and had adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to
them, and have no jealousy in their breasts for that which they have
been given [from the booty of Banu an-Nadeer], and give them
[emigrants] preference over themselves even though they were in
need of that. And whosoever is saved from his own covetousness,
(Qur'an 59: 9)
such are they who will be the successful.8
This applies to the An& in particular, but it does not stop
there, rather Allah ( B )mentions others and says:
(And those who came after them say, 'Our Lord! Forgive us and our
brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any
hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed
full of kindness, Most Merciful.')
(Qur'an 59: 10)
This is general and applies to those who come afier them. There is no
one among the Musllms who does not have a right to thisfay '. 'Umar
said: "If I live, a shepherd in San'2 (Sana of Yemen) will most
certainly get his share of this fay' without having to ask for it."55
According to another report, 'Umar said: "How about those
Muslims who come and find that the land with its people has been
divided and inherited from father to son and has become exclusively
theirs? This is not a good idea." 'Abdur-Ra!unib ibn 'Awf said to
him, "What is your opinion? The land and its people are no more than
what Allah has given them as fay'." 'Umar said, "That is what you
say but I do not say that. By AUah, no land will be conquered after me
where there is a lot of fay', rather it is likely to be a burden on the
Muslims. If the land of Iraq and its people are shared out, and the land
of Syria with its people, then who will guard the borders? What will
be left for the children and widows of this land and other lands of
Syria and Iraq?" They argued a great deal with 'Umar and said, "Will

'Umar ibn al-Khagb

457

you give what Allah has bestowed on us by means of our swords to
people who were not present, and to their children and their
children's children who were not present?" 'Umar did not say any
more than, "This is my opinion." They said, "Consult others." So he
sent for ten of the An& who were elders and nobles of al-Aws and
al-Khazraj and addressed them, saying among other things, "I am like
any one of you. Today you say what you think is right, and it does not
matter who disagrees with me or agrees with me. I do not want you to
follow what suits my whims and desires." Then he said, "You have
heard the words of those who say that I have wronged them, but I
thought that there would be nothing to be conquered after the land of
Chosroes; Allah has given us their wealth, their land and their people
and I divided the wealth they seized as booty among those who were
entitled to it, and I took the khums and spent it as it should be spent. I
thought that I would leave the land and the people working on it as
they are, and impose the khar-4 on them for it, and impose on them
the jizyah, which they would pay and it would be a fay' for the
Muslims, for the fighters and the children, and for those who come
after them. Look at these borders which require men to guard them.
Look at these great cities which need a huge army to protect them,
which in turn needs money. Where will this money come fi-om if I
divide the land and its people?" They all said, "Your view is correct
and you have spoken well. If you do not guard these borders and
these cities with men, and you do not spend on them to keep them in
good shape, the Efir-s will come back and take over the cities."56
'Umar also said: "If I divide it among them, it will become a
fortune used by the rich among you (cf. Qur'an 59: 7), and the
Muslims who come after you will not have anything. Allah has given
them a right to that, as He (&) says:

(And those who came after them...b

(Qur'an 59: lo)."

Then he said: "This refers to all the people until the Day of
Resurrection." After that, 'Umar and the senior Sahribah decided not
to divide the land.57
From his discussion with the Sahribah we can see 'Umar's
style of argument, and how he combined the strength of evidence and
presented it well, and sought to soften the heart of his opponents, in
what he said to the An& when discussing the land of as-Sawgd. If
there was a politician who had a great deal of experience in
addressingparliament and he wanted to address the delegates in order
to win their approval for some project, he could not come up with
anything more eloquent than this. On top of that, 'Umar was
distinguished by the fact that he meant sincerely what he said, and
was not speaking as a ma@ politician; his style is unparalleled.s8

Did 'Umar go against the Prophet (@I
in his ruling on the land of Wlarij?
There are some who say that 'Umar went ag&t the
Messenger @) by not dividing the land of kharrij, because the
Prophet @J divided Khaybar. They say that if the rnler leaves the
land that was conquered by force as it is, that is going against the
Sunnah. But this is wrong and is an audacious accusation against the
Rightly-Guided Caliphs. What the Prophet
did in Khaybar
indicates that what he did is permissible; it does not indicate that it is
obligatory. Even if we did not have any evidence that it is not
obligatory, the actions of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs 'Umar,
'Uthmia and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them) are sufficient to
indicate that it is not obligatory. So how about the fact that Makkah

'Umar ibn al-Khattrib

459

was conquered by force as is narrated in many ahcideeth; in fact the
reports narrated by the scholars of Maghizi and Seerah reach the
level of being mutawcitir
When Quraysh broke the treaty, the Prophet @)
- came and
camped in Marr a&-DJahrh. None of them came to seek a peace
treaty with him, and he did not send anyone to seek a peace treaty
with them. Rather Abu Sufiyin went out to reconnoitre and was
caught by al-'Abbh, who brought him as a prisoner, or at best we
may say that al-'Abbk gave him security and he was under his
protection. Then he became Muslim, so how can it be imagined, once
he became one of the Muslims, that he would make a peace treaty on
behalf of the kuffcir without the permission of the kuffir? What
confirms that is the fact that the Prophet @J stipulated conditions of
safety for the kuffir by saying: ccC'Whoeverenters the house of Abu
Sufiyin is safe; whoever enters the Mosque is safe; whoever locks his
door is safe."nS9Those who did not fight him were safe; if there had
been a peace deal, there would have been no need to announce that.

(a)

called them Nlaqa ' (freed ones),
Moreover, the Prophet
because he freed them &om being held prisoner, such as Thamzmah
ibn Athil and others. And he gave permission to kill some of them,
men and women. And it is proven in the books of Saheeh that he said
in his address to them: cct'Fighting in Makkah was not made
permissible for anyone before me and it will not be permissible for
anyone after me, and it has only been permitted to me for a short
while. " D ~ ~
He entered Makkah wearing a helmet on his head, and he was
not wearing ihrcim. If there had been a peace deal, none ofthat would
have been permissible for him. Ifhe had made a peace treaty with any

city that was not a sanctnary, it would not have been permissible for
him to do any act of war therein, so how about the holy city whose
people were at peace with him? Moreover, they fought Khilid and a
group of Muslims killed a group of kt@&.
In conclusion, anyone who studies the reports will inevitably
realize that Makkah was conquered by force, but despite that the
Prophet &) did not divide its land or take its men captive. He
conqueredXhaybar by force and he did divide it, and he conquered
MaMcah by force and did not divide it. So it is known that both are
permissible.61
So 'Umar was not going against the guidance of the Prophet

(g)
when he did not divide the conquered lands. He based his
decision on a number of principles, including the following:
1. The verse on fay' in Soorah al-fhhr

a)

2. The actions of the Prophet
when he conquered MaMcah by
force then left it to its people and did not impose the kharij on it.

3. The decision of the majlis ash-shoora (consultative committee)
which 'Umar formed to address this issue after the discussion and
debate.
These became the guidelines that were followed with regard to
land conquered by the Muslims, who decided to leave the land to its
owners. Thus it becomes clear that when 'Umar differentiated
between transferable booty and land, he was following the evidence
of the texts, reconciling between them and understanding each of
them in the proper way. In addition to that, 'Umar intended that the
people of the conquered lands should keep their wealth and that the
Muslim solkers should be protected from thefitnah of fighting over

'Umar ibn al-Khattib

461

land and property and from thefifimah of laziness and being distracted
by wealth and worldly ac~umulation.~~
'Umar turned to the Holy
Qur'an to seek a solution and he examined the various verses and
sought a deep understanding of their meanings. He looked at them
together and tried to find out the explanation of one by means of
another until he reached conclusions that achieved the hoped-for
purpose based on the spirit of shari'ah, without being restricted by the
apparent meanings of the texts. He was helped through all these
stages by his precise understanding of the aims of shari'ah which are
included in these texts. This was a complex procedure which could
not be undertaken by anyone except one who has experience in
ijtihad and has been given a proper understanding and the courage to
reach the right conclusions. It was thought by some that 'Umar was
ignoring the divine text in some cases, but 'Umar could never do that;
rather he was a man who excelled in ijtihad and had a deep
understanding of the aims of shari'ah, to such an extent that when he
voiced his opinion, Qur'an would be revealed which was in
accordance with it. The conclusion that we draw from this case is that
parts of the Qur'an explain other parts, and the same applies to the
Sunnah. So when the mujtahid is seeking shar'i rulings he has to
examine all the texts which will help him to find the answer, without
restricting himself to only some of them, otherwise he will be
regarded as falling shoa in his ijtihad, and whatever conclusion he
reaches will be null and void.63

How was the principle of kharkj
implemented at the time of 'Umar?
When the senior Sahibah and decision-makers approved of
'Umar's suggestion of leaving the land with its owners and dividing

462

Financial and Judiciary Institution&at the Time of 'Umar

the transferable wealth among the conquerors, he appointed two
senior persons as delegates, namely 'Uthmin ihu Hunayf and
Hudhayfah ibn al-Yam& to go and measure the land of as-Saws in
Iraq. When he sent them on this mission, he gave them profound and
wise advice. He commanded them to take note of the wealth of
individuals, and how fertile or infertile the land was, and the types of
plants and trees, and he commanded them to be kind to the people:
they were not to be burdened with more than they could bear, rather
they were to be left with what they needed for times of hardship and
their regular needs. So that his decision would he based on a fair and
just foundation, 'Umar wanted to find out the situation of the people
of Iraq before the conquest. So he asked these two Sahribis, ' U t h h
ibn Hunayf and Hudhayfah ibn al-Yamin, to send him a delegation of
the leaders of as-Saws. They sent them to him and he asked them:
"How much did you used to give to the Persians (as taxes) for your
land?" They said: "Twenty-seven dirhams." 'Umar said, "I would
not take that from
This indicates that the Islamic conquest
was fair and just to the people whose lands were conquered. 'Umar
thought that basing the kharij on the size of the land was more fair to
the people and would give a better return, without imposing more
than they could bear. So ' U t h h ibn Hunayf and Hudhayfah ibn alYamk did the job they were commanded to do in a commendable
fashion, and the size of the land of as-SawSd turned out to be
36,000,000.~~
For a field of grapevines the rate was ten dirhams; for a
field of palm trees it was eighty dirhams; for a field of reeds it was six
dirhams; for a field of wheat it was four dirhams, and for a field of
barley it was two dirhams.66They wrote to 'Umar telling him about
that and he approved it.

'Umar was keen to take care of the people of those lands and
was keen to establish justice lest 'Uthmin and Hudhayfah had
burdened the people and the land with more than they could bear. So
he asked them: "How did you work out the taxes on the land? It may
be that you have burdened the people with more than they can bear?
Hudhayfah said: "I have left something for the people." 'Uthmtin
said: "I left double what I took, but if you wish I will take it." 'Umar
said: "By AUah,if I live I will ensure that the widows of the people of
Iraq would need no other ruler after me."67
The method that was employed in the Sawid of Iraq was also
implemented in the lands of Egypt, except that the one who was in
charge there was 'Amr ibn al-'AS and the unit used to measure the
land for the kharcij was the acre (fedd~n).~'
'Umar did the same with
the land of Syria as he had done with the land of as-Sawkl, but the
historians do not give any clear details of the unit of measurement or
the types of crops and h i t s on which the kharcij was imposed, or
who undertook this procedure of measuring the lands of
The caliph 'Umar made an accurate estimate of the governors'
wealth before they were appointed, then when the govemors finished
their tours of duty, he would confiscate some of the wealth that they
had accumulated for themselves during their tours of duty, if it
became clear to him that their salaries did not allow them to
accumulate all this wealth.70We will discuss that in more detail when
we discuss the govemors. The property of the state that 'Umar (&)
had allocated to the bayt al-mcil in Iraq, Syria and Egypt became vast,
and these properties brought a huge income to the state coffers,

especially in Egypt where the agricultural holdings of the state in
ancient times were immense.71

W h a t was achieved i n security terms
by not diwiding the kharij lands
There are a number of security interests that were served when
the caliph and those who supported h i took this decision. I can
divide them into two categories, the first ofwhich is internal interests,
primarily blocking the way to disputes and fighting among the
Muslims, guaranteeing the availability of a regular income for the
land and people, and meeting the material needs of future generations
of Muslims. The second category is external interests, the most
importaDt of which include providing an income to help protect the
Muslim borders, meeting the need for men and supplies, the ability to
equip armies and pay their salaries, financing equipment and
weapons, and allowing some groups to take on the mission of
guarding the border and the state's lands by relying on the income
!?om these lands.
It must be noted here that by making this decision, the caliph
wanted to lay down a strong foundation for political stability, not
only in his own era but also in the following eras. His comments such
as, "What about the Muslims who are yet to come?" and "I did not
want some of the Muslims to be left out," indicate that he was
thinking ahead and planning for comprehensive security. The
development of political events during the reign of the second caliph
prove that his view was correct.
The fact that the decision-making process with regard to the
division of land had so many stages confirms two things: "One is that
important decisions that are vital to Muslim interests may take a great

"' Op. cit., p. 118.

'Umar ibn al-Khagdb

465

deal of time and effort, and they may require a certain amount of
deliberation when exchanging ideas, without that leading to disputes
or widening gaps, or leading to ignoring some interest that have to do
with the present or future security and safety of the ummah. The other
is that some important decisions may only be reached after a difficult
debate and discussion and some initial confusion, which may require
the ruler to bear the bsunt of responsibility in narrowing the gap
between opposing views, so that he may lead the Muslims to the
shar 'i rnling concerning the matter about which they are disputing.72
This exchange of views between the caliph and those of the
Sahebah who did not agree with him, with each group basing its
views on the revealed texts, proves that the main point of expressing
different views in political decisions in general, and those which have
to do with the Muslims' interests in particular, is that these views
must be based on the revealed texts.
The fact that the caliph consulted the senior Sahiibah who had
knowledge of the fiqh of rulings and the sources of shari'ah, and their
responding by offering him sincere advice, confirms that the people
of shoora should have distinguishing qualities. Those whose advice
is to be sought are the people of understanding and wisdom, who are
aware of their role. More precisely, they should be those who do not
follow current trends and who habitually train themselves to speak
the truth and act upon it, not fearing the blame or criticism of a ruler
or anyone else.
It remains to be said that what happened with regard to the
decision not to divide the land represents a sublime example of how
the Sahribah debated and interacted in accordance with the etiquette
and ethics of debate, examining different views, starting with

thinking about the decision not to divide the land. Foremost among
them was the caliph 'Umar who did not go beyond this etiquette
despite the fact that their opinions differed?3 Rather 'Umar explained
that the ruler was simply another member of the shoora council. He
whether
announced his trust in the shoora council of the d,
they agreed or disagreed with him, and he announced that he would
refer to the Book of Allah. He (&) said: "I am like any one of you.
Today you will base your decision on the truth, whether you disagree
with me or agree with me. You have kom Allah a Book that speaks
the truth."74

The impact of this decision on da'wah
One of the most important effects of this decision was that it
put an end to the feudal system. 'Umar abolished the unfair system
that had made land-ownership a monopoly and enslaved the peasants
to cultivate the land for nothing. 'Umar left the land of as-saws in
the hands of the peasants, who were to cultivate it in retum for paying
a just tax (kharij)which they would be able to afford each year. The
peasants were pleased with the decision of 'Umar ibn al-Khat$b
(&), which gave them possession of the apricultural land which
they were to cultivate in return for the khartj which they could
afford. This made them feel for the fust time in their lives that they,
and not the feudal lords of the ruling class, were the owners of the
agricultural land. The peasants had been simply workers who
cultivated the land and got nothing in retum, and all their hard work
went to line the pockets of the feudal class of land-owners, who left
them nothing but a few crumbs.75

Pre-emptive actions to stop the Byzantines and Persians
calling the people to arms afer they had been expelled
'Umar's policy of giving the land to the peasants ofthe regions
that had been conquered by force made them feel content, as stated
above. This made them hate their former rulers, the Persians and
Byzantines, so they did not offer them any help. On the contrary, they
offered help to the Muslims against them. The Persian commander,
Rustam, called the people of al-Heerah and said: "0' enemies of
God, you rejoice at the Arabs' invasion of our land, and you help
them against us, and you support them with money!"76

The people of the conquered lands hastened to enter Islam
Another result of giving the land to the peasants was that they
hastened to enter Islam, which spread among them at an astonishing
and unprecedented rate. They recognized justice and the truth
became apparent to them, and they recognized their human dignity
because of the manner in which the Muslims treated them.77

Managing the wealth to protect the borders
The Islamic state stretched in all directions and its borders
expanded at an early stage. One of the most important of these
borders was that which was known as the Euphrates border, which
extended along a strategic line separating the Islamic state from the
Byzantine Empire and other borders. In every region 'Umar kept as
many horses as were needed, and the number of horsemen stationed
on the borders was more than thirty thousand. This is in addition to
the numbers of foot soldiers and other forces such as those who rode
camels etc. 'Umar kept them as an army which was organized to
protect the Muslim borders, and he guaranteed their provision so as

to keep them from being distracted by anything from jihad for the
sake of spreading the call of Islam. The Wlarij was one of the means
by which Allah made it possible to equip these forces and guarantee
provisions for their s0ldiers.7~

'Umar (&) laid down guidelines for the organization of the
kharij as an important source of income for the state coffers. The aim
behind it was so that the bayt al-mil would be able to do what it
needed to of achieving the interests of the ummab,guarding the
borders and securing the roads. That could only be achieved by
keeping the people on the land which the Muslims had acquired by
force, in return for a specific percentage of the yield of the land. This
made them work harder and invest more time and effort in the land,
and is in direct contrast with the way in which they had previously
been exhausted by taxes by their rulers before the arrival of the
~uslims.7~

1.1.4.The 'ushoor (tithe)
The 'ushoor is a tax that is collected ftom traders who pass
through the borders of the Islamic state, whether they are coming in
or going out. It is akin to customs duties in the modem age. It is
collected by an official who is known as al- 'ashir, i.e., the one who
collects the ' ~ s h o o r . ~ ~
This tax did not exist at the time of the Prophet @gJ

caliph, Abu Bakr (&), because that was a period of calling people to

spread east and west, and the state began to trade with the
neighbowing states, then it became necessary to serve the public
interests. 'Umar decided to impose this tax on those who came to the
Muslim lands just as ah1 al-harb (non-Muslims who were in a state of
war with Islam) imposed it on Muslim merchants who came to their
lands, by way of respondmg in kind.
~istorians~'
are agreed that the first one to impose the 'ushr in
Islam was 'Umar ibn al-Khatjiib (&). That occurred when the
people of Manhij (near Aleppo in Syria) and people from beyond the
sea of Yemen wrote to him asking him to allow them to come to the
Arab lands with their merchandise and offering to pay one-tenth
('ushr) in return for that. 'Umar consulted the Companions of the
Prophet @) about that, and they agreed to it. So he was the first one
to collect the 'ushoor.But 'Umar wanted to be certain of the amount
that other states were taking from the Muslim merchants when they
crossed their borders, so he asked the Muslims: "What did the
Ethiopians do to you when you enter their land?" They said, "They
take one-tenth of what we have with us." He said, "Then take from
them the same as they take from
He also asked 'Uthmk ibn
Hunayf, "How much do ah1 al-harb take from you when you enter
their country?" He said, "One-tenth." 'Umar said, "Then take the
same from them."83
It was narrated that Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari wrote to the caliph
'Umar and said: "Some of our Muslim merchants go to the land of
ah1 al-barb and they take one-tenth from them." The caliph 'Umar
wrote back to him and said, "Take from them what they take from the
Muslim merchants. Take half of one-tenth from ah1 adh-dhimmah,

and take from the Muslims one dirham for every fo*, but take
nothing if there is less than two hundred. If there is two hundred, then
five dirhams are due, and whatever there is above that is to be worked
out on the same basis."84
This new legislation played a role in regulating trade relations
between states. Muslim traders earned a great deal when the doors of
the Islamic state opened to trade, and goods came into the Muslim
state from all comers of the earth. This naturally encouraged both
~ u s i i mand foreign traders to Increase their eEorts in imporbng and
exporting goods from all parts of the world. Thus commercial centres
became active in all parts of the Muslim state, including the Arabian
Penhula, and trade caravans came and went fiom all regions of
Arabia to other Islamic regions. The ports of the Muslim world
received the great sbips which reached them from India, China and
East Africa, laden with the most precious of goods. A11 these
activities were evident during the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs
and the Umayyad state.85
During 'Umar's reign, the tax-collectors took zakah fkom the
wealth of the traders who passed by them taking into account the set
thresholds and whether a full year bad passed. Anas ibn M%k said:
'Umar ibn al-Kha@b sent me to collect the zakah of Iraq, and said:
"If a Muslim's wealth reaches two hundred dirhams, take five
dirhams fiom it. Kit is more than two hundred, then take one dirham
from every forty."86
Ash-Shaybihi stated that 'Umar ibn al-Khatjib sent Ziy2d ibn
Jareer (or it was said Z i y a ibn Hadeer) to collect the zakab &om

'Ayn at-Tamr. He told him to take one-quarter of one-tenth (2.5%).
He was to take one-half of one-tenth from ah1 adh-dhimmah if they
had trade goods, and one-tenth from ah1 al-barb. 'Umar gave the
'ashir a salary from the wealth that he collected.87
The one who studies the way in which the caliph 'Umar ibn alKhaGb (&) defined the taxes for different groups will reach the
conclusion that he imposed the 'ushr (one-tenth) on ah1 al-harb
because that is how they treated the Muslims. This is the principle of
treating like with like. He imposed half of one-tenth on ah1 adhdhimmah to distinguish them from the Muslims, and in accordance
with what he had previously imposed on the Christians of Banu
Taghlib who agreed to let him take from them a jizyah that was
double what he took &om the Muslims in zakah.
What he collected from the Muslims was akin to zakah, and
the threshold for zakah on trade goods is well known. This threshold
is what he set as the minimumlimit for taking it. He did not allow it to
be taken from the Muslims and ah1 adh-dhimmah more than once, so
long as the capital remained and the value of the incoming goods did
not become more than the capital, even if it was brought in more than
once, until after one full year had passed. This was in accordance
with the principle of treating like with like.
When ah1 al-harb increased the taxes that they took from the
Muslims, the Muslims had the right to increase the taxes on the goods
they brought into the Muslim lands by the same amount. Similarly,
when they waived the taxes, the Muslims were bound to waive the
taxes for them. This is how states operate nowadays, and it is called
lifting customs barriers.''

Financial and Judiciaiy Institutions at the Time of 'Umar

472

When the Muslims needed some goods and products that were
imported to them, they lowered the taxes or let the merchants off, so
as to encourage them to bring in more. The caliph 'Umar did that,
when he told his agents to take one-half of one-tenth from the ah1 alharb when they brought olive oil and p i n s into Arabia. He also let
them off on other occasions.
It was narrated from az-Zuhri, from SSlilim, from his father, that
'Umar used to take one-tenth from the Nabataeans for cotton goods,
and half of one-tenth for wheat and olive oil, so that more of these
goods would be brought to ~ a d e e n a h . ' ~
These financial regulations which were introduced at the time
of the caliph 'Umar ibn al-KhatJib (&) played a great role in
facilitating trade between the Muslims and their neighbours and in
bringing in many kinds of goods that the people wanted and needed.
His concern was not l i i t e d only to organizing the income that came
to the bayt al-mil, rather he also looked at ways by means of which
the income of the bayt al-mil could be increased so that the land
would be blessed with ease and prosperity. That included his interest
in external trade and treating the merchants well, following up with
the agents and governors and writing to them. He was keen that the
state should get its rightful dues without being harsh in collecting

from the people of the townships - it is for Allah, His Messenger
wuhammad], the kindred [of Messenger Muhammad], the orphans,
al-Masrikeen [the poor], and the wayfarer.)
(Quu'an 59: 7)
Ghanci'im refers to the wealth of ahl al-harb that the Muslims
acquire by force.92 Allah (%) says:
(And know that whatever of war-booty that you may gain, verily,
one-fifth [1/5th] of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and
to the near relatives [of the Messenger (Muhammad)], [and also] the
orphans, al-Mascikeen [the poor] and the wayfarer, if you have
believed in Allah and in that which We sent down to Our slave
[Muhammad] on the Day of Criterion petween right and wrong], the
Day when the two forces met [the battle of Badr]; and Allah is Able
to do all things.)
(Qur 'an 8: 41)
During the caliphate of 'Umar (&,) the booty increased
greatly because of the conquest of vast areas that were prosperous.
The leaders of the Persians and Romans used to go out to the
battlefield with al.! their wealth and splendour, which all fell into the
hands of the Muslims, on occasion reaching amounts of 15,000
dirham or 30,000 dirhams.93
Great cities such as a l - M a i n , Jaloola', Hamdhk, ar-Rayy,
Asakhar and others were conquered, and the Muslims acquired a
great deal of wealth, such as the carpet of Chosroes, which was 3600
square cubits, covered with gold and decorated with precious stones,
with images of h i t in gems and covered with silk that had images of

dirhams. The Muslims also acquired a great deal of go14 silver and
precious stones kom the booty of Jaloola' and Nahawand. The
khum of Jaloola' reached six million dirh~ms.9~
The greatest booty came kom the land of as-Sawid which
'Umar established as a waqffor the state, and the lands of %-Saw%
whose owners had been killed or had fled, and the lands of Chosroes
and his M y , the produce of which went to the state, so they were
managed in order to provide extra income to the bayt al-ma. It was
said that its produce eventually reached seven million dirham.
The booty was immense and it made the Muslims rich both on the
individual and state level and raised the standard of living. Its effects
95
were seen more clearly during the caliphate of 'Uthmh

(4).

These were the most important sources of state income at the
time of 'Umar (&).

1.2. The bayt al-mil of the Muslims and
the establishment of official records
The bayt al-mil is the place to which the income of the state is
brought and the place kom which all the outgoings of the state come,
such as the stipends paid to the caliphs, armies, judges and agents and
the expenses of public facilities and other things that belong to the
~tate.9~
Official records (dmdween, sing. diwcin) refers to the
documents in which are recorded the affairs of the state. The word

475

diwcin was given by the Persians to the place where the scribes and

employees in charge of these records gather.97
Initially the Islamic state did not have a bayt a l - m i l in the
sense that was known later on, because the policy of the Messenger
@) was not to delay in dividing or spending wealth. Abu Bakt
followed the same method as the Prophet -- and 'Umar followed
the same way as his two companions at the beginning of his
caliphate, until the authority ofthe Islamic state spread east and west.
Then he started to tbink of a way to manage the wealth and booty, and
the income &om jizyah, kharrij and zakah, that was being
accumulated by the caliph as the result of the conquests. Moreover,
the army had expanded and needed a way to manage its needs and
record the names of its men, lest some of them miss out on payments
and others be paid more than once.

a),

The conquests and victories continued, and wealth continued
to increase in a way that the Muslims hid never known before. 'Umar
decided that it was beyond the capability of the caliph and his
governors to keep track of everything, and that it was ecouomically
unwise to leave control of financial affairs in the hands of the agents
and governors without regulating it or keeping accounts. The result
of that thinking was the establishment of rules to control the way in
which this wealth was handled. Thus the diwrin was set up. 'Umar
was the first one to establish the diwrin (official records) in the
Islamic state?'
How that happened was narrated by the historians: "Abu

have you brought?' I said, 'I have brought five hundred thousand
dirhams.' He said, 'Woe to you! Do you know what you are saying?'
I said, 'Yes, a hundred thousand, and a hundred thousand, and a
hundred thousand, and a hundred thousand, and a hundred thousand.'
He said, 'You must be tired, go back to your family and sleep, and
come to me in the morning.' The next morning, I went to him and he
again asked, 'What have you brought?' I said, 'I have brought five
hundred thousand dirhams.' He said, 'Woe to you! Do you know
what you are saying?' I said, 'Yes, a hundred thousand...' and I
counted it five times on my fingers. He said, 'Are you sure?' I said, 'I
do not know anything other than that.' He ascended the minbar and
praised and glorified Allah, then he said, '0' people, a m a t deal of
wealth has come to us. If you wish, we will give it to you by measure,
or if you wish we will count it out for you.' A man stood up and said,
'0' Ameer al-Mu 'mineen, I think that these Persians keep records for
the~nselves.'~~
'Umar liked the idealo0,so he consulted the Muslims
about keeping records. Some of them gave their suggestions, except
for al-Waleed ibn H i s h h ibn al-Mugheerah, who said, 'I went to
Syria and I saw that their kings kept records and organized the army.
So keep records and organize the army.' According to some reports,
the one who said that was Kh2lid ibn al-waleed."lO'
Some historians state that there was one of the Persian satraps
in Madeenah, and when he saw that 'Umar was not sure what to do,
he said to him: "0' Am- al-Mu'mineen, the rulers of Persia have
something that they call diwBn. Whatever income they get and
whatever they spend is all controlled and nothmg is left unrecorded.
The people who are entitled to stipends are all written down under
different categories with no room for error." 'Umar liked this idea

and said, "Describe it for me." So the satrap described it for him, then
he compiled the official records of those who were entitled to
stipends.'02
' U M liked the idea of keeping official records and he
suggested: "I think that there is enough wealth for everybody, but if
no records are kept of who has taken something and who has not, I
fear that money may be ~asted."''~
These are some of the reports which indicate that 'Umar
consulted those who were with him numerous times. There is a
difference of opinion among the historians as to the year in which the
official records were set up. Some say that it was in 15 A.H., such as
at-Tabari, who was followed by Ibn al-Atheer and others. Other
historians say that it was in Mulpmm 20 A.H., such as al-Balidhuri,
al-Wiiqidi, al-Miwirdi, Ibn ~ h a l d o o n and
' ~ ~others. It is more likely
to have happened in 20 A.H., because in 15 AH. the battle of alQidisiyah took place, and the conquests of Iraq, Syria and Egypt
were not completed until after that.'''
'Umar dlvided the wealth in a manner different to that
employed by Abu Bakr. Abu Baln had divided the wealth among the
people equally, whereas 'Umar divided it on the basis of seniority in
Islam (who had come to Islam first), participation m jihad and
support for the Messenger of Allah &).Io6 'Umar thought that this
was what should be done during the time of Abu Bakr, and when he
saw Abu Bakr dividing the wealth equally among the people he said

during the year of the Conquest out of fear of the sword?" Abu Bakr
said to him: "What they did was for the sake of Allah and their
reward is with Allah. In this world all that you need is what a traveller
needs." 'Umar said to him: "Do not make one who fought against the
Messenger of Allah
like one who fought alongside him."Io7

a)

Hence 'Umar divided the people into different categories
when he allocated wealth, as follows:
Those who had come to Islam first and strove hard, by means of
whose jihad this wealth had become possible
+:* Those who brought benefits to the Muslims, such as governors
and scholars who brought both worldly and spiritual benefits

O Those who strove to ward off harm kom the Muslims, such as the
Mujrihideen who were fighting for the sake of Allah, soldiers,
spies, advisors and so on
*: Those who were in need''

This policy of dividing wealth is wbat 'Urnar referred to when
he said: 'Wo one has more right to this wealth than anyone else, but a
man is paid according to his seniority, or according to how much
benefit he brings to the Muslims, or accordingto how much he strives
to ward off harm, or according to his needs.Iog
'Umar called 'Aqeel ibn Abi T%b, Makhramah ibn Nawfal
and Jubayr ibn Mut'im -who were young men of Quraysh -and
said: 'Write down the people's names according to their status."

They started with Banu H5shii and wrote down their names, then
they wrote down Abu Bakr and his people, then 'Umar and his
people, and they wrote down all the tribes, and gave that to 'Umar.
When he looked at it, he said: "No, this is not how I wanted it to be.
Start with those who are closest to the Prophet @), then the next
closest and the next closest, and put 'Urnar where Allah put him."
Banu 'Adiyy came to the caliph 'Umar (&) and said: "Yon

the
successor of Abu Bakr (&), and Abu Bakr was the successor of the
- Why don't you put yourselfin the category

where these people who wrote it down suggested you should be?"
He said, 'Wo, no, O'Banu 'Adiyy. Do you want to take advantage of
me? Do you want me to give my hasanrii to you? You are to be
placed in the right position even if it is at the bottom of the list. I have
two companions who followed a path, and if I follow a different path
I will end up in a different place. By Allah, we have not reached such
a high position in this world and we do not hope for reward tiom
Allah except by v&ue of Muhammad @J. He is our leader and his
people are the noblest of the Arabs, then the next closest and the next
closest..."i10
'Umar began to record in his official records the names of
those who were entitled to stipends and how much they were entitled
to. This was called diwcin al-jund (the record of the troops) on the
basis that all the Muslim Arabs were soldiers in jihad for the sake of
Allah. In his record of the troops he started with Banu Hkhim, those
who were closest to the Messenger of Allah &), then those who
were next closest, then those who came after them in different
categories, and he gave each of the Muslims a certain amount. He
allocated stipends to the wives and concubines of the Prophet (#J,

480

Financial and Judiciary Institutions at the Time of 'Umar

and to all the Muslims, men, women and children h m birth, and
slaves, in varying amounts."'
By devising the record, 'Umar demonstrated his concern for
jihad for the sake of Allah. He paid a great deal of attention to the
Mujlihideen and the protection of their rights. The records of troops
were kept in Arabic in Madeenah, at the hands of a number of
brilliant men of Quraysh and those who had knowledge of their
lineages. Then he ordered that similarrecords be kept in otherparts of
the Muslim world. These records were kept in the languages of the
conquered lands, and were not translated into Arabic until the
caliphate of 'Abdul-Malik ibn Marwin and his son al-Waleed.
ARer compiling these records, 'Umar began to collect the
wealth for a year, then he divided it among the people, because he
thought that collecting it would bring a greater blessing. Collecting
the wealth needed trustworthy people. Zayd ibn Arqam was in charge
of the bayt al-mil at the time of mar."' Abu 'Ubayd narrated with
his isnad from 'Abdul-Qiri -fiom the tribe of a l - Q M -that he
said: "I was in-charge of the bayt al-mil at the time of 'Umar ibn alKha@b (L&,).""~

Sunnah, and the actions of the Sahribah (may ALlah be pleased with
them) explain the ways in which these types of wealth were sPent.li4

1.3.1. Expenditure of zakah
Allah describes eight categories of people to whom zakah is to
be given, as He ( B )says:
(As-Sadaqrit mere it means Zakah] are only for the Fuqar6' [poor],
and al-Mascikeen [the poor] and those employed to collect [the
funds]; and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined
[towards Islam]; and to free the captives; and for those m debt; and
for Allah's Cause [i.e. for Mujihidoon - those fighting in a holy
battle], and for the wayfarer [a traveller who is cut off from
everything]; a duty imposed by Allah.And Allah is All-Knower, AllWise.$
(Qur'an 9. 60)

The poor and needy at the time of 'Umar were given enough of
this wealth to distance them from poverty and want and raise them to
the lowest levels of independence and prosperity.115 'Umar used to
say: "When you give, give enough to make a poor man independent
of means."l16
This was 'Umar's wise policy. He would give enough and
more to who were tempomrily unable to work because of sickness
etc. For those who were chronically incapacitated, he would st111give
them zakah. 'Umar's policy went beyond the Muslims to include the
people of the Book too, after thejizyah had been waived for them."'

Another of the groups on whom zakah may be spent is those
who are employed to collect it, who have various roles and tasks, all
of which have to do with the organizing and calculating of zakah,
such as finding out for whom it is obligatory, on what kind of wealth
it is obligatory, how much is due, to whom it must be paid, how many
of them there are, what the extent of their need is and how much is
s a c i e n t for them, and other matters which need a full team of
experts and specialists and people to support them."*
With regard to those whose hearts are to be to reconciled,
'Umar waived their share, because Islam was in a strong position
during his caliphate, so there was no need to spend zakah wealth on
this category, which is one of the eight categories mentioned in the
But nowadays there are still people whose hearts need to be
reconciled or won over to Islam in one way or another, and there are
those who meet the conditions of this category.120Some opponents
of Islam have used this story of 'Umar's waiving the share of those
whose hearts are to be reconciled to make their claim that by doing
so, 'Umar stopped a ruling that is mentioned in Qur'an. This claim is
not correct, and it ignores the facts of the matter, because in fact
'Umar stopped the share of those whose hearts are to be won over for
a reason, which is that Islam had become powerful and strong after it
had been weak at the beginning. He thought that there was no need to
win over the hearts of these people after Islam had become victorious
and powerful.121The Sahibah agreed with 'Umar's decision and
their agreement was not given without thought, rather they were
convinced of the reasons for stopping the share to those whose hearts
were to be won over, because Islam had become strong which meant

there was now no need to worry about a small number who camed no
weight, since many nations had now entered Islam. There was no
reason to fear these people. Rather the fear was that they might
become dependent on this income. Moreover, their share was not
something to be inherited, generation after generation.122
'Umar did not look at this text about those whose hearts are to
be reconciled in a rigid way. He understood that the aim of the text
was to support Islam by bringing the leaders of the Arabs into the
faith and making those who became Muslim steadfast in Islam. He
looked at the reason behind the text, not the apparent meaning. Allah
had made Islam victorious and increased its numbers, so giving these
shares now - in 'Umar's view - was a kind of humiliation. The
reason for which Allah had allocated a share of zakah to those whose
hearts were to be reconciled was no longer present. Based on this,
'Umar stopped this share and did not give it to them.
Based on this sound understanding, we cannot say that 'Umar
abolished acting on this Qur'anic verse which speaks of giving a
share of zakah to those whose hearts are to be reconciled, because
abolishing comes under the heading of abrogation, and no one can
abrogate Qur'an except the Lawgiver. Hence abrogation came to a
stop after the death of the Messenger @).lZ3 'Umar was paying
attention to changing circumstances as we have stated above.lZ4
Zakah is also to be spent on ffeeing slaves, helping debtors,
supporting jihad for the sake of AUah, and helping wayfarers. The
Qur'an paid a great deal of attention to the matter of wayfarers and
and of the khums of war booty.

concern is confirmed by the teachings of the Prophet
Bakr. During his reign, 'Umar ibn al-KhaGb (&) set up a special
institution known as dar ad-daqeeq, in which were kept flour
(daqeeq), saweeq, dates, raisins and other necessruy goods which
were used to help stranded travellers, guests and those who came to
stay as guests of 'Umar. 'Umar placed on the routes between Makkah
and Madeenah whatever stranded travellers might need to get fiom
one oasis to the next.lZ5

a)

This d e f ~ t i o nof the eight categories who were entitled to
zakah required the state to know their names and how many of them
there were. So records had to be kept in each land, and also in the
capital of the state. A special department was set up for zakah under
the auspices of the caliphate, with branches in each province. That
was set up during 'Umar's caliphate after the public records had been
set uP.lz6
If we look at the eight categories mentioned in the verse, we
will notice that they encompass religious, political and social
interests of calling for jihad for the sake of Allah, forming armies,
striving to put an end to poverty, paying off debts and meeting the
needs of the needy. In other words they include all the requirements
of society and the establishment of security, love and hannony
amongst people.127

The caliph's stipend
Five thousand dirhams (or six thousand, according to another
report) were allocated to the caliph 'Umar ibn al-Khash.

Governors' stipends
This is what was given to the governors of the various regions.
During his caliphate, 'Umar appointed a strong and resolute governor
to rule and administer each province, and he provided him with a
number of helpers, assistants, collectors, judges, scribes, workers to
deal with khardj and zakah, and others. The governor was to lead the
prayers and to lead the people at times of war, and he had another
agent under him whose role was to collect money. There were other
skilled and experienced workers whose job was to measure land,
calculate taxes and keep records of the names of people. They were
given salaries commensurate with their positions and the tasks
required of them, how near or far the region was, its degree of
prosperity and whether the cost of living there was high or low. No
set date was given for paying out stipends.lZ8We will discuss these
agents and workers in more detail when we speak about the
institution of al-'ummdl (agents).

A m y salaries
'Umar was concerned about the army and he organized
records for the army (diwrin).He divided wealth on the basis of close
relationship to the Prophet @lessings and peace he upon him) and
seniority in slam,'^^ Hence those who were at the top of the list for a
regular salary were the family of the Messenger of Allah @),
namely Banu Hkhim. Al-'Ahhik (may Allah be pleased with him)
would take the payment and distribute it among them. Then came the

wives of the Prophet @), to each of whom was given a salary
separate from that of ah1 al-bayt.
The rest of the Muslims were divided into categories based on
their participation in jihad for the sake of Allah, starting with those
who had been at Badr, then those who had fought after Badr and up to
al-Hudaybiyah, then those who had fought from al-Hudaybiyah up to
the end of the Riddah wars, then those who had been present at alQ2disiyah and al-Yarmook, and so on. He allocated special funds to
the wives of the warriors and their children from birth. He did not
ignore slaves and foundlings either, he allocated an annual stipend for
them, the least of which was one hundred dirhams, which increased
when they reached puberty.'30 He also allocated between one and
two thousand to fieed ~ 1 a v e s . l ~ ~
The stipend given to the wives of the Prophet &) was ten
thousand dirhams annually, except for Juwayriyah, Safiyyah and
Maymoonah, who were given less than that. Then it was increased to
twelve thousand dirhams, except for Safiyyah and Juwayriyah, who
were given six thousand dirhams. 'kishah (I&,) asked for equal
amounts to be given to all the Mothers of the ~elievers,and 'Umar
agreed to that.
The stipend for the Muhcijireen and An& was four thousand
dirhams for each person each year, except for 'Abdullih ibu 'Umar
ibn al-Khasb, who was allocated three thousand five hundred
dirhams. The reason given was that his father had brought him with
him when he migrated, so he was not like one who had migrated for
himself.'32 'Abdullih had been a child at the time of the Hijrah. Then
one thousand was added to the stipend of the Muhcijireen, so their

i

'Umar ibn al-Khattdb

stipend became five thousand dirhams annually.'33 It seems that this
was given only to those of the Muhbjireen and Ansir who had been
' ~ ~ who had been present at the treaty of alpresent at ~ a d r . Those
Hudaybiyah were given a stipend of three thousand dirhams each
year.135
Every newborn was given a stipend of one hundred dirhams. It
was originally allocated to weanlings, then it was allocated to
newborns lest parents be too hasty in weaning their children.
With regard to freed slaves, the nobles among them, such as alHormuzk~when he became Muslim, were given two thousand
dirhams and other allowances.

In addition to the annual stipend, 'Umar used to give out
various other payments.136 In addition to the stipends and gifts
mentioned above, each individual was also given a measure of wheat
every month.13' The caliph 'Umar (&) said at the end of his reign:
"Ifwealth increases, I would give each man four thousand dirhams: a
thousand for travelling, a thousand for his weapon, a thousand to
leave behind for his family, and a thousand for his horse and
mule."138
'Umar believed that every Muslim had a right to the bayt almBZ from the cradle to the grave. He declared this principle when he
said: "By Allah, besides Whom there is no other god (which he
repeated three times), there is no one who does not have a right to this
wealth, whether it is given to him or withheld from him. I am just like

any one of you with regard to it, but we are all entitled to it in
accordance with our position as indicated in the Book of Allah and
our position with regard to the Messenger of Allah (g).
So a man is
paid according to his seniority, or according to how much benefit he
brings to the Muslims, or according to how much he strives to ward
off harm, or according to his needs. By AUah, if I live, a shepherd in
the hills of San'P (Sana) will get his share of this wealth where he is,
before he dies.139
It is important to explain 'Umar's point of view in not
allocating equal shares among the Muslims, his clear support for the
relatives of the Messenger of Allah @) and the senior Sahibah
among the M u h a i r e e n and Ansir, and his attention to seniority in
Islam and contribution to jihad. Undoubtedly the group that had
acquired all this plentiful wealth during his caliphate was the group
on whose shoulders the Islamic state was built. They also had more
understanding of Islam and its aims, and adhered more closely to its
laws, and they were more righteous and pious in dealing with wealth
and using it to achieve the social aims by means of spending.
Supporting this group economically strengthenedits power in society
and made it more able to enjoin what is good and forbid what is evil.
It may be noted that 'Umar resolved to change this policy of
preference and give everyone equal shares. He clearly stated that at
the end of his caliphate when he said: "If I live until next year, I will
make the last of the people equal to the k t , and I will treat them all
the same."'40
'Umar's views on public wealth were expressed when he said:
"Allah has made me the keeper of this wealth, and the divider
thereof." Then he said: "Rather Allah has decided how it is to be

divided."'41 He wept when he saw the huge amount of wealth that
had been brought to the bayt al-mil during the conquest of Persia.
When 'Abdur--5a
ihn 'Awf pointed out to him that this was a
day of thanksgiving and joy, 'Umar said: "NO. This is never given to
a people but it stirs up enmity and hatred among them."'4z He looked
at the wealth from the conquest of Jaloola' and recited the verse:
(Beautified for men is the love of things they covet; women,
(Qur 'an 3: 14)
children, much of gold and silver...)
He said: "0' Allah, we cannot help but rejoice in that which has been
beautified for us, so make me spend it rightfully, and I seek refuge in
You from its evil."143

1.3.3. The expenditure of ghana'im
With regard to the distribution of ghanci'im, it was to be
divided as described in the verse in which Allah (&) says:
(And know that whatever of war-booty that you may gain, verily,
one-fifth [1/5th] of it is assigned to Allah, and to the Messenger, and
to the near relatives [of the Messenger (Muhammad)], [and also] the
orphans, al-Mascikeen [the poor] and the wayfarer...) (@r2an 8.41)
As for the remaining four-fifths of the booty, they were
distributed among the waniors, with each horseman getting three
shares two for his horse and one for him -and each foot soldier
getting one share.144

When the Prophet @) was alive, he had a share which he
spent on himself and his wives. Whatever was left of these shares was
spent on puhlic interests or on the poor and needy. The relatives of
the Messenger @) had the second share, namely Banu Hkhim and
Banu '~hdul-~utjalih,
who had submitted to Islam and become
Muslims. After the death of the Prophet &), the people differed
concerning these two shares, the share of the Messenger
and the
share of his relatives. Some said that the share of the Messenger @)
should he given to the caliph after him, and others said that the share
of the relatives should be given to the relatives of the Messenger
Another group said that the share of the relatives should be given to
the relatives of the caliph after him. Then they agreed to spend these
shares on mounts and weapons.145Thus the two shares were spent in
the public interests of the Muslims, such as preparing armies,
guarding the borders and working to strengthen the state at the time
of the second caliph, 'Urnar ibn al-Khagb (&).

with public funds, as can be seen kom his words: "I tell you about

winter, a suit for summer, a mount for Hajj and 'Umrah, and food for

1.3.4. Matters pertaining to the economic
development of the state

Issuance of Islamic currency
Currency made of precious metals such as gold and silver is
regarded as an essential means of life in society, especially in
dealings between nations and states. Our focus here -when Islam
had acquired a state in which Muslims and others lived, and where
neighbouring nations and states had systems and cultures which
continued to interact with the Islamic state at the time of 'Umar and
other Muslim caliphs and rulers - is the administrative method
followed by 'Umar with regard to currency, whether within the
Islamic state or in interactions with other states.149The historical
information indicates that 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b kept the currency
that had been in circulation before Islam and at the time of the
Messenger of Allah @YZJ and Abu Bakr. These were Byzantine coins
with Christian inscriptions, or Persian coins with Zoroastrian
inscriptions. It seems that he approved of the official standard of
coins that was known at the time of the Prophet
and Abu Bakr,
and he added to them the word "ji'iz" (valid) to-distinguish them
from counte~feits.'~~

approved of dealing with them, and decided on the weight of the
Islamic d i r h a m was 'Umar (&). Al-Miiwardi says: " 'Umar ibn dKhatJib was the one who decided on the weight of the Islamic
dirh~m."'~'
Al-Maqreezi says: "The first one to mint coins in Islam
was 'Umar ibn al-KhaEiib in 18 A.H., imprinting over Persian
inscriptions, adding the words "al-Hamdu Lilkih (praise he to
Allah)" or "LB ilBha illa-All& (there is no god but Allah), and
adding the name of the caliph 'Umar on part of it."I5' Thus 'Uestablished a system dnring his rule for an essential means of living
for the Muslims and others. He was followed by the Rightly-Guided
Caliphs and others who developed this idea fnrther as life and
civilization progre~sed.'~~

Allocation of land
Abu Ba!u continued to follow the Prophet's method of
allocation of land to the people for the purpose of making use of it.
He gave to az-Zubayr ihn a l - ' A w h some unused land between alJarf and ~ a n i i t 'and

following the advice of 'Umar (&) who said that there was no need
to reconcile their hearts towards Islam. 'Umar said to them: <<''The
Messenger of Allah (Blessings and peace be upon him) used to seek
to reconcile your hearts, but at that time Islam was weak. Now Allah

has made Islam victorious, so go and work hard.">>l5'
It is clear that 'Umar's objection was not to the allocation of
land per se, rather it was to the people themselves; he did not think
that their hearts needed to be reconciled to Islam. 'Umar gave a lot of
land to people who would make good use of it, following the
Prophet's policy. He declared: "0' people, whoever revives dead
(i.e., unused) land, it is his."156 This is supported by weak reports
which confirm that 'Umar (&) took back land that he had allocated
if it was not used properly. A weak report states that there was a threeyear limit from the date of the allocation of the land. It is proven that
r ' he
~ ~gave to
'Umar allocated unused land to Khawit ibn ~ u b a ~and
az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwh all the land of al-'Aqeeq. He gave the land
of Yanbu' to 'Ali ibn Abi TkLih, where fresh water started flowing
through it. 'Ali (4)
gave it as a waqffor charity to the poor. There
are other weak reports which say that 'Umar allocated land to a
number of other w ah rib ah.'^^

2. The Judicial System
When Islam spread and the state expanded at the time of
'Umar, and the Muslims came into contact with other nations, the
new situation demanded the development of the judicial system. The
caliph became very busy and the job of the governors in the various
regions became more complex, and the number of fights and disputes
increased. 'Umar decided to separate the departments of government
in the provinces and to give the judges independent authority, so that

the governors would be free to runthe affairs of their provinces. Thus
the judicial system became independent of other departments, and
'Umar was the first-one to give the judges their own independent
department. He appointed judges in the Islamic regions, in Koofah,
Basra, Syria and Egypt, and he gave the judges authority for which
they were answerable directly to h i , whether they were appointed
by the caliph himself or by one of the governors on his behalf. This
indicates that the Islamic leadership was represented in the person of
'Umar and that he was not incapable of setting out basic rules to
organize the affairs of state and deline the powers and authority of
various government departments. Europe discovered this principle in
theoretical terms in the eighteenth century, and considered it a new
step in the organization of state affairs and protection of citizens'
rights, but it was not put into practice until the beginning of the
nineteenth century, i.e., after the French Revolution. But Islam
a w e d this principle fourteen centuries before, and regarded it as
fundamental to its system. This principle existed from the time of the
Prophet
when he sent Mu'&& to Yemen and asked him:"How
will you judge between people, 0' Mu'$&?" Mu'&% explained that
he would judge according to the Book of Allah, if he did not find an
answer there, he would judge according to the Sunnah of the
Messenger of Allah @J. If he did not find an answer there, then he
would try his best to work it out. And the Messenger (g)
approved
of that.'''

m),

'Umar set out to develop the judicial system and other things
that were connected to it. It was during his era that the principle of
separating the judiciary from other government departments was
practised clearly in people's lives. The independence of the judiciary
did not prevent 'Umar (&) from intervening in some cases. It may
be that he allowed some ifhis governors to act as judges in addition

to their executive powers, and he corresponded with them conceming
judicial matters. He corresponded with al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah
concerning judicial matters when he was the govemor of Bqra, then
of Koofah. He corresponded with Mu'iwiyah, his govemor in Syria,
conceming a judicial dispute. He corresponded with Abu Moosa alAsh'ari concerning some cases. The judge was appointed for the
whole province, either by the caliph or by the governor acting on the
orders of the caliph. The seat of the judge was the capital of the
province, and he was responsible for judicial matters in his
province.
The setting up of an independentjudiciary was done mostly in
the large provinces, such as Koofah and Egypt. In some cases
governors acted as both governors and judges, if judicial matters did
not distract them fiom their gubernatorial duties. He sent this
description of the judge's role to them.

In some cases 'Umar passed judgement even though he had
judges in ~ a d e e n a h . ' ~Among
'
the judges whose role was limited by
'Urnar during his caliphate to that of a judge was 'Abdullih ibn
Mas'ood, whom 'Umar appointed as the judge of Koofah. QatikM
narrated &om Abu Majlaz that 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b sent 'Amm5r
ibn Yisir to lead the people of Koofah in prayer, and he sent
'Abdull2h ibn Mas'ood to be in charge of the b a y t al-mi1 and the
judiciary. 16'

Those who were appointed as both governors and judges
included the following:
-Nift' al-Khuzi'i, the governor of Makkah. Ibn 'Abdul-Barr stated

that 'Umar ibn al-Khatjib appointed him as governor of Makkah,
although there were leaders of Quraysh among them. Then he
dismissed him and appointed Khilid ibn al-'& ihn Hishim ibn alMugheerah a l - ~ a k h z o o m i . ' ~ ~

'Umayr ibn Sa'd, the governor of Homs.
Among these were some whom 'Umar kept as judges as well
as appointing them as governors, as he did with Mu'iwiyah, and
some fiom whom he took away the role ofjudge and limited them to
their role as governor, as he did with al-Mugheerah and Abu Moosa
al-Ash'ari. Among the judges whom 'Umar appointed in Madeenah
were 'Ali ibn Abi ralib and Zayd ibn Thzbit. It was narrated from
Ni6' that 'Urnar appointed Zayd ibn Thibit in charge of the judiciary
and allocated a stipend for him.164

2.1. The most important letters
from 'Umar to the judges
'Umar set out some valuable legislation for the judiciary
system. Many scholars of Islamic fiqh have sought to explain and
comment on this legislation. We find 'Umar's legislation on the
j u d i c i q in his letter to Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, in which he said:

"In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
From the slave of Allah the son of al-KhaGb, Ameer al-Mu'mineen,
to 'Abdull* ibn ~ a ~ speace
' ~ be
~ ,upon you.
Judging (the judicial system) is a confumed obligation and a way to
be followed. Try to understand when cases are presented to you, for
there is no use in a person presenting his case if it is not understood.
Treat people equally when you address them so that no noble man
will hope that you will side with him unfairly and no weak man will
despair of your justice. The burden of proof rests with the plaintiff
and the oath is required of one who denies it. It is permissible to make
a deal between Muslims, except a deal that permits something that is
forbidden or forbids something that is permitted. If you passed a
judgement yesterday then examined it further in your mind and are
guided to a different conclusion, then that should not prevent you
fiom returning to the truth, for truth is eternal, and returning to the
truth is better than persisting in falsehood. Examine carefully each
issue which you are m u r e about, where there is no text in the Qur'an
and Sunnah, and try to fmd a similar case; draw analogies and see
which is more likely to be pleasing to Allah and closest to the truth.
Whoever claims that someone owes him some dues, set a time limit
for him to produce his evidence. If he produces evidence, then restore
his rights to him; otherwise ask him to drop his claim. That is better
'66 'Abdullih ibu Qays is Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari. [Author]

so as to eliminate any doubt. The Muslims are basically of good
character, except one who has been lashed as a hadd punishment or
who is known for bearing false witness. Allah is in charge of what is
hidden in people's hearts. Judgement must be based on evidence and
oaths. Beware ofbecoming impatient, because judging in accordance
with tmth brings a great reward from Allah and stores up a great deal
of reward (in the Hereafter). Whoever has a good intention and
n thim (and he need not
checks himself, Allah will be ~ ~ c i e for
wony about people), but whoever shows an attitude to people which
Allah knows is not his trne atthde, AUah will expose him. Think of
the reward of Allah in this world and in the Hereafter. And peace (be
upon
This letter sums up the etiquette of the judge and the principles
according to which judgement should be passed. The scholars have
been explaining it and commenting on it for many centuries, and it is
still a source of amazement and pride for everyone who reads it. Even
if nothing else had been reported from 'Umar, he would be counted
as one of the greatest thinkers and legislators on the basis of this
letter. If it had been written by a head of state nowadays when the
rules and regulations on running courts are so widespread, and
discussions on such matters are something that children read about in
school, it would still be something great and important. So how about
if we remember that 'Umar wrote it fourteen centuries ago, and he did
not quote it from a book or learn it fiom someone else. Rather it came
fiom his own mind, and is just one example of the fruit of the faith
planted in his heart, when he came to him in
which Muhammad (g)

and that Muhammad is the Messenger of

Another of the important letters that 'Umar wrote concerning
this matter was his letter to Abu 'Ubaydah in which he said:
"I have written to you a letter in which I have not spared myself or
you any goodness. Adhere to these five characteristics and your
religious commitment will be safe and you will succeed. When two
disputants come to you, you must look for clear proof and a definitive
oath. Be gentle with the weak one so that he will have the courage to
speak. Take care of the stranger, for if the investigation into his case
takes too long, he may give up and go back to his family. S!xive to
bring about reconciliation, unless it becomes clear to you who is in
the right and who is in the wrong."169
'Umar wrote to MuC2wiyahibn Abi Sufiyh concerning
judicial matters:
"I have written to you a letter in which I have not spared myself or
you any goodness. Adhere to the five characteristics and your
religious commitment will be safe and you will succeed. When two
disputants come to you, you must look for clear proof and a definitive
oath. Be gentle with the weak one so that he will have the courage to
speak. Take care of the skanger, for if the investigation into his case
takes too long, he may give up and go back to his family. The one
who neglected his right is the one who did not take care of him. Treat
them equally and give them equal attention. Strive to bring about a
reconciliation, unless it becomes clear to you who is in the right and
who is in the wrong."'70
He wrote to the judge Shurayh concerning ijtihad and said: "If
a case is referred to you, judge conceming it according to what is in
the Book of Allah. If it is not mentioned in the Book of Allah, then
judge concerning it according to the Sunnah of the Messenger of

i
Allah. If there comes to you a case which is not mentioned in the
Book of AUah or the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah and is not
discussed by anyone, then choose whichever of the two options you
want." According to another report he said: "If you want to work it
out yourself, then go ahead, and if you do not want to, then do not,
and I think that not doing so is better for you."171
By studying the letters of 'Umar and the story of his caliphate,
the researcher can leam about the salaries that were paid to judges,
the kinds ofjudges who were appointed, their duties and obligations,
the sources of their rulings, the fact that the caliph himself submitted
to the judges and other matters that have to do with the judiciary.

2.2. Appointment of judges, their salaries
and their judicial specialities
2.2.1. Appointment of judges
Judges were appointed directly by the caliph, as when 'Umar
appointed Shurayh as the judge of Koofah, or they were appointed by
the governor acting on behalf of the caliph, as when 'Amr ibn al-'&,
the governor of Egypt, appointed 'Uthmh ibn Qays ibn Abi al-'As
as a judge in Egypt. The right to appoint judges belongs to the caliph;
if he wishes he may appoint them himself, or if he wishes he may
delegate his governor to do that. The appointment ofjudges does not
prevent the caliph fiom examining some cases and passing
judgement himself, because judicial matters come under his authority
and he is the one who delegates the role ofjudge to others. But he is
primarily entitled to pass judgement, and a judge only acquires that

"' Jdmi' Bayna al-'llm wa Fadlihi, 2170

'Umar ibn al-Khanlib

501

role when he is appointed by the caliph himself or by his govemor.17'
It is permissible for the caliph to dismiss a judge for any reason, such
as if the judge is not longer qualified and fit to pass judgements, or if
it is proven that he has done something that does not befit the position
of a judge. If there is no reason to dismiss him then it is better not to
do so, because a judge who has been appointed to serve the interests
of the Muslims should remain so long as their interests are being
served.173'Umar (&) dismissed some judges and appointed others,
as when he dismissed Abu Matyam a l - ~ a n a f i ' ~in~whom
,
he found
some weakness.

2.2.2. Judges' salary
'Umar used to advise his governors to choose those who were
fit to be judges and to give them sufficient salaries.175He wrote to
Abu 'Ubaydah and M u ' m saying: "Choose righteous men to
appoint as judges and give them

Dr. al-'Umari mentions the salaries of some of the judges at the
time of 'Umar, which were as follows: Salmin ibn Rabee'ah alBihili (Koofah), 500 dirhams each month; Shurayh d-Q&li
Koofah), 100 d i r h a m s each month; 'Abdullih ibn Mas'ood alHudhali (Koofah), 100 d i r h a m each month and one quarter of a

2.2.3. Judicial specialities
During the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, judges would
pass judgments on all kinds of cases, no matter what type they were,
such as financial disputes, family matters, hudood punishments and
qi&, and any other kind of disputes. There is nothing to indicate that
there was anything like what is known nowadays as judicial
specialities, apart ftom the reports that as-S2ib ibn Yazeed ibn Ukht
Nimr was appointed and was told by 'Umar: "Go and look after the
cases that have to do with minor financial disputes."178
Judges dealt with cases having to do with civil rights and
personal matters. As for hudood punishments and qi&,
these were
referred to the caliph and regional governors, who had to approve of
the ruling. Approval of carrying out the death penalty was restricted
to the caliph alone, but governors had the right to approve of cases of
qi& that did not involve the death penalty.
There was no specific place set aside for judicial procedures,
rather the judge passed judgements in homes and mosques, but it was
more common for such procedures to take place in the mosque.179
Cases were not recorded because they were so few and were easily
remembered. It was possible for a judge to detain the accused as a
rebuke and so as to force him to restore people's rights. This was
done by 'Umar, 'Uthm2n and 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with them).
The state set up prisons in the city centres. Qa& punishments were
carried out outside the mosques.180

2.3. Qualities of the judge and
what was required of him
2.3.1. Qualities of the judge
From the life of 'Umar the scholars have derived the most
important qualities of the judge who is to be appointed.
+
*: Knowledge of the rulings of shari'ah: Because he is going to apply
them in the cases he deals with, and it is impossible for him to
apply them if he does not h o w them.

Piety (taqwa): 'Umar wrote to M u ' m ibn Jabal and Abu
'Unaydah ibn a l - J a telling them, "Look for some righteous
men among you and appoint them as judges."'*'

Lack of interest in what people possess: 'Umar (4)
said, 'Wo one
can establish the commands of Allah except one who is not
trying to appease people or show off, and who has no
materialistic ambition^."'^^
*:* Intelligence: It is essential that a judge should be smart and
intelligent, one who notices subtle matters. It was narrated
from ash-Sha'bi that Ka'b ihn Siwir was sitting with 'Umar
when a woman came to him and said, "0' Ameer alMu'mineen, I have never seen a man who is better than my
husband. By Allah, he spends the night in prayer and he
spends his days fasting, and does not break his fast on a hot
day." He prayed for forgiveness for her and praised her and
said, "You are saying something good about your husband."
The woman felt shy, so she leR. Ka'b said, "0' Ameer al181

Mu 'mineen,why didn't you help her to solve her problem with
her husband?" 'Umar asked, "What was she complaining
about?" He said, "She was complaining about a serious
problem with her husband." He asked, "Is that so?" He said,
"Yes." He said, "Bring the woman back." He said (to her),
"There is nothing wrong with s p e h g the mth. This man
claims that you were complaining about your husband and that
he avoids your bed." She said, "Yes. I am a young woman and
I want what any woman wants." He sent for her husband, who
came to him. Then 'Umar said to Ka'b, "Pass judgement
between them." He (Ka'b) said, "The caliph is more entitled to
pass judgement between them." He said, "I insist that you pass
judgement between them, for you understood something about
their situation that I did not understand." He said, "I think that
if there were three wives and she was the fourth, she would
have one night in every four. So I rule that he should keep three
days and nights for himself during which he may pray, and she
should have one day and night." 'Umar said, "By Allah, your
suggestion is more amazing than your understanding her hint.
Go, for you are the judge of ~ a ~ r a . " ' ~ ~
*:* Strictness without harshness; kindness without weakness: 'Umar
said, 'mo one should be appointed to this role but a man who
has four qualities: kindness without wealmess, strictness
without harshness, moderation without stinginess and easiness
without extravagance." lS4

+*: Strength of character: 'Umar said, "I am going to dismiss Abu
Maryam and appoint a man who when the evildoer sees him he
will be scared." So he dismissed him fiom the post ofjudge of

Mmvsoo'oh Fiqh 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, p. 723
lbid, p. 724.

'Umar ibn al-Khagb

505

Basrah and appointed Ka'b ibn Soor instead.lX5

*:* He should be wealthy and of a good lineage: 'Umar wrote to some
of his governors saying, "NO one should be appointed as a
judge except one who is well-off and of good lineage. The one
who is well-off will have no desire for people's wealth, and the
one who is of good lineage will not be scared of people."'86

2.3.2. What is required of the judge
There are some matters which 'Umar stated the judge must pay
attention to in order to establish justice. These include:
+
*: Sincerity towards Allah in one's actions: 'Umar wrote to Abu
Moosa al-Ash'ari saying, "Passing correct judgement brings
reward from Allah and will store up reward for you (in the
Hereafter). Whoever has a sincere intention to establish the
truth, even if it is against himself, Allah will suffice him and
protect h i from the people. Whoever puts on a pretence that
is not in his heart, Allah will shame him. AUah, may He be
blessed and exalted, does not accept any deed &om people
except that which is sincere. Think of the reward of Allah in
this world and in the ere after."'^^

-3 Precise understanding of the case: He should study it carefully
before passing his ruling. It is not permissible to pass the ruling
before the truth of the matter is clear. 'Umar wrote to Abu
Moosa al-Ash'ari saying, "Try to understand the case when it
is referred to you." On one occasion Abu Moosa said, "A
judge should not pass judgement until the truth is as clear to

him as night and day." News of that reached 'Umar ibn alKha@b and he said, "Abu Moosa has spoken the
O Ruling according to Islamic shari'ah whether the disputing parties
are Muslim or not: It was narrated ftom Zayd ibn Aslam that a
Jewish woman came to 'Umar ibn al-KhaMb and said, "My
son has died, and the Jews are saying that I have no right to his
estate." 'Umar called them and said, "Why don't you give her
her rights?" They said, "We cannot find anything in our Book
that gives her any rights." 'Umar said, "Is that in the Torah?"
They said, 'No, in the Mishnah." He asked, "What is the
Mishnah?" They said, "A book that was written by scholars
and wise men." 'Umar cursed them and said, "Go and give her
her rights!"189
+:* Consulting others about any matter ofwhich he is not sure: 'Umar
wrote to one of his judges saying, "Consult those who fear
Allah with regard to your religion."190 He wrote to Shurayh
saying, "If you want to consult with me (then do so), for I think
that your consulting with me is better for you."191 'Urnarused
to consult others so much that ash-Sha'bi said, "Whoever
would like to have the most reliable judgment, let him adopt
the judgement of 'Umar, for he used to consult others."19z
*:*

Treating disputants equally: 'Umar wrote to Abu Moosa alAsh'ari saying, "Treat people equally when you address them
so that no noble man will hope that you will side with him
unfairly and no weak man will despair of your justice." He
also wrote, "Treat people as equal with regard to the truth, both

the one whom you know and the one whom you do not know."
When Ubayy ibn Ka'b made a claim against 'Umar with
regard to a garden which 'Umar did not know about, they
appointed Zayd ibn Thibit to judge between them. They went
to him in his house and when they entered, 'Umar said, 'We
have come to you so that you may judge between us." Zayd
moved to let him sit in the best seat
and according to
another report, Zayd brought out a cushion and gave it to hirn,
saying, "Here you are, 0' Ameer al-Mu'mineen." 'Umar said,
"You have been unfair in your judgement at the outset, 0'
Zayd. Rather let me sit with my opponent," and they both sat
in front of him.193
-

Encouraging the weak So that he will not be a h i d and will dare
to speak up. 'Umar wrote to Mu'iwiyah saying, "Be kind to the
one who is weak so that he will be encouraged to speak."194
O Dealing quickly with the case of a stranger, or else supporting him

until the case is over: 'Umar write to Abu 'Ubaydah saying,
"Pay extra attention to the stranger, for if he has to stay too
long -and be away from his family because of this case -he
will forego his rights and return to his
+:*

Patience: 'Umar wrote to Abu Moosa saying, "Beware of
boredom, anger, anxiety and feeling annoyed with people
when passing judgement. If the judge notices any of these
things it is not permissible for him to pass judgement unhl that
has gone away, lest his psychological state affect the
judgement he passes."

'Umar wrote to Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari saying: "Do not pass
judgement when you are a n g ~ y . " 'And
~ ~ it was narrated that Shurayh
said: " 'Umar stipulated when he appointed me as a judge that I
should not pass judgement when I was angry."197 Things that may
lead to impatience and sometimes make a judge hasten
inappropriately to pass judgement include hunger, thirst and so
on. Hence 'Umar said: "The judge should not pass judgement until he
has had enough to eat and drink."'98
*:* Avoiding everything that may influence the judge: Such as bribes,
or traders being easygoing with him, or his going to the
marketplace, or accepting gifts and bribes. 'Umar wrote to

Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari, "Do not buy and sell, make
investments or accept bribes with regard to rulings." Shurayh
said, 'Umar stipulated when he appointed me as a judge that I
should not buy and sell or accept bribes. 'Umar said, "Beware
of bribes and of ruling according to your whims and
desires. "19'
*:* Deciding on the basis of apparent evidence without probing into

intentions: 'Umar addressed the people and said, (('We knew
you when the Messenger of AUah &)was amongst us, and
the Revelation would come down and tell us about you. Now
we know you from what you say, so whoever appears to us to
be good, we will assume that he is good and treat h i well.

Keenness to reconcile between disputing parties: 'Umar said,
"Turn disputants away in the hope that they will reconcile, for
settling the matter in court generates grudges between people.
If they reach a settlement that is in accordancewith the laws of
Allah, let the judge approve it, and if their agreement is not in
accordance with the rulings of shari'ah, let the judge cancel
it." 'Umar said, "It is permissible to make a deal between
Muslims, except a deal that permits something that is
forbidden or forbids something that is permitted."20'
*:* The judge should be keen to bring about reconciliation especially

between disputants in cases where it is not clear who is in the
right. 'Umar wrote to Mu'iwiyah saying: "Strive to work out
agreements among people when it is not clear who is in the
right, or if they are related, for settling issues in court generates
gmdges."202

some case, then he changes his view on that issue afterwards
after studying it further, he cannot go back and change his
ruling. It is also not permissible for a judge after him to
overrule the judgement he passed. It was narrated that S k
ibn Abi al-Ja'd said, "If 'Ali were to have undone a judgement
that had been passed by 'Umar, he would have undone his
judgement conceming the people of Najrrin. 'Ali had written
down the treaty between the people of Najrrin and the Prophet

feared for the people conceming them. Then a disagreement
arose between them and they came to 'Umar and asked him for

compensation, so he compensatedthem. Then they regretted it
and something happened among them, so they came to him
and asked him to let them off, but he refused to do so. When
'Ali became caliph, they came to him and said, '0' Ameer alMu'mineen, you interceded for us and wrote a treaty with your
right hand.' 'Ali said, 'Woe to you! 'Umar was right in what he
did,7~03'Umar refused to undo the first judgement that he had
passed concerning them, and after 'Umar had died, 'Ali
refused to undo the judgement that 'Umar had passed
concerning them."'"
'Umar changed his opinion concerning many cases, such as
the ruling concerning a grandfather when there are brothers (of the
deceased, in cases of inheritance), or full brothers sharing one-third
of the inheritance with uterine brothers when there is nothing of the
estate left for the full brothers. But there is no report that he went back
and changed his first judgement, rather he applied his new ijtihad in
subsequent cases, and his old ruling did not prevent him fiom
following the truth when it became apparent to him. 'Umar wrote to
Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari saying: "If you pass a judgement today, then
you change your opinion and are guided to the correct view, that
should not prevent you fiom adopting what is true, for truth is eternal
and cannot be invalidated by anything. Retuning to the truth is better
than persisting in falseh~od."'~~
On this basis, 'Umar ibn al-Kha@h issued various rnlings
concerning the grandfather (in cases of inheritance). He ruled that if a
wife dies and leaves behind a husband, mother, two half-brothers
through her father and two half-brothers through her mother, then the

(full-) brothers through the father and mother and the half brothers
through the mother share one-third of the estate. A man said to him:
"You did not rule that they share the estate in such and such a year."
'Umar said: "That was the judgement that we passed then, and this is
the judgement that we pass now."206
*:* The accused is innocent until proven guilty: It was narrated that

'Abdullih ibn 'h
said, "I set out with a caravan and when
we came to Dhu al-Marwah, a cloak of mine was stolen, and
one of those people was with us. My companions said to him,
"0' So and so, give him back his cloak." He said, "I did not
take it." I went to 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b and told him about it.
He asked, "Who was there?" I told him who they were and I
named the one who I thought did it and I said, "I wanted to
bring him in chains." 'Umar said, "How could you bring him
m chains without any proof?"207
+:* If there is a text there is no room for iitihad: 'Umar said, "Try to
understand whatever cases are referred to you where there is
no evidence fiom the Qur'an or Sumah, then try to make an
analogy between the case that is before you and similar cases
that are dealt with in Qur'an and ~unnah."~'~

These are the most important matters to which the judge must adhere.

2.3.3. Judges themselves are subject
to the rulings on judges
'Umar was the first one to submit to judges even when he was
at the peak of his caliphate. He would express clear admiration if the

judge got it right and would sincerely praise the judge, even if the
ruling went against him.'09 There follow some examples of that.
'Umar wanted to buy a horse &om a Bedouin. He rode it to try
it out, and the horse became lame. 'Umar said: "Take your horse."
The man said, "No." 'Umar said, "Then appoint a judge between me
and you." The man said, "Shnrayh." So they referred to him for
judgement. When he heard what they had to say, he said, "0' Ameer
al-Mu'mineen, take what you bought, or give back what you took as
you took it." 'Umar said, "This is the way to pass judgement," and
he sent him as a judge to ~ o o f a h . ' ~ ~

2.4. Sources of judicial rulings
Dnring the era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, judges relied on
- and his judges had
the same sources as the Messenger of Allah &)
relied, namely the Qur'an and Sunnah and ijtihad, but some new
developments appeared during their era:
The process of ijtihad and acting upon it was developed further,
which resulted in new procedures, such as consultation, shoora,
ijmti' (consensus), r a 'y (opinion) and q i y h (analogy). There also
appeared new sources which did not exist at the time of the Prophet
&J, namely legal precedents which had been issued by the Suhdbuh
during the reigns of different caliphs. So the sources of judicial
rulings at the time of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs were: the Qur'an,
the Sunnah, ijtihad, ijmti' (consensus), qiycis (analogy), and legal
precedents. All of that was supported by shoora and consultation
concerning issues, cases and rulings. There are many texts and

reports which support these sources as mentioned above, some of
which we will quote below.z11
1. Ash-Sha'bi narrated that Shurayh said: " 'Umar said to me, 'Judge
in accordance with what you know of the Book of Allah; if you do
not know of anything in the Book of Allah, then judge according to
what you know of the judgements of the Messenger of Allah a ) . If
you do not know of anything in the judgements of the Messenger of

Imams. 1f you do not know of the judgement of the guided Imams,
then try to work it out yourself, and consult knowledgeable and
righteous people.' "'12
2. It was narrated fiom Ibn ShMb az-Zuhri that 'Umar ibn alKhagb (&) said, when he was on the minbar: "0' people, in the
ra'y (personal opinion) was
case of the Messenger of AUah
always correct, because Allah guided him. But in our case it is
speculation and conjecture."213 And it was narrated that he said:

3. Ibn al-Qayyun said: "When 'Umar was appointed as calipb, he
said, 'I feel too shy before Allah to reject anything that Abu Bakr
said."15 'Umar also confirmed this in another letter to Shurayh in
which he said, 'Judge according to what is in the Book of Allah. If
there is nothing in the Book of Allah, then according to the Sunnah of

passed by the righteous.' "'I6
4. Ijmi' (consensus): If the judge could not find any text in the
Qur'an or Sunnah, he would refer to the scholars and consult the
Sahibah andhqaha'. He would discuss the matter with them and
they would research it and try to work it out. If their efforts reached a
single conclusion, then this is consensus (ijmi?, which a the
agreement of the mujtahids of a single generation of the ummah of
Muhammad
upon a shar'i matter. This is the third source of
Islamic legislation according to scholarly consensus. It appeared for
the first time during the era of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs. Many
texts have been narrated concerning it, and there are lengthy
discussions of it in the books of fiqb, zqool al-fiqh and the history of
legislation. But the cases in which there was consensus are few, and
the possibility of consensus existed only in Madeenah, which was the
capital of the caliphate and the meeting-place of the Sahibah,
scholars and hqaha'. It was very rare in other cities.217

a)

An example of that is the report that Ibn 'Abbis asked
'Uthmin (may AUah be pleased with them both): "Two brothers
(akhawin) in the dialect of your people does not mean brothers
(iWlwah), so why is their mother's share (of inheritance) reduced
fiom one-third to one-sixth on the basis of the verse,

d... If the deceased left brothers or [sisters], the mother has a sixth... )
(Qur'an 4: II)?"

He ('Uthmib) said, "I cannot undo a judgement that was
passed before me and has become widespread and people have
inherited in accordance with it." What he meant is that the consensus
was reached before Ibn 'Abbis raised this objection, so his objection
did not affect that consensus.

I
I

'Umar ibn al-Khatfrib

515

Consensus should be based on three main principles:
consultation, ijtihad and agreement. If any of these is missing, then
the judge should move on to the next source.

5. Legal precedent: i.e., judgements passed by previous caliphs,
righteous men and senior Sahdbah (may Allah be pleased with
them). This is what 'Umar described in clear terms with regard to the
prior judgements of Abu Bakr, and it is what he enjoined upon his
judges and governors, as stated above.''' This is also what Ibn alQayyim stated clearly under the title, "The opinion of the Sahdbah is
better than our own opinion." And he said: "Those whose opinions
have such a high status should be better for us than our own opinion.
How could it be otherwise? Those are opinions which came from
hearts that were filled with light, faith, howledge and understanding
of AUah and His Messenger, and with sincerity towards the ummah.
They were following in the footsteps of their Prophet with no
intermediary between them and him. They transmitted knowledge
and faith kesh, direct and unsullied ftom the Prophetic source, with
no confusion or dispute. To think of the opinions of others as being as
good as their opinions is a serious mistake.'19

6 . Analogy (qiycis):But legal precedents are also very rare. If a judge
cannot find a text or consensus, or any legal precedents, then he must
rely on ijtihad, as it says in the hadith of M u ' a . Analogy is what
comes h t when striving to work out (ijtihad) an issue concerning
which there is no text. This is the fourth source of legislation, fiqh
and rulings. This is what is mentioned in the letter of 'Umar to Abu
Moosa al-Asha'ri, in which he said: "Then look for similar cases and
make an analogy, and see what conclusion is most likely to be
acceptable to Allah and is most likely to be correct."220

'18

7. Opinion (ra 'y): If there is no basic text to which an analogy may be
made, then the judge must work out his own opinion as to what is
closest to the h t h , justice and the basic principles and aims of
shari'ah. This is what is repeated in the reports quoted above, in the
letters of 'Umar to Shurayh and others.z21

Consultation and shoora were among the most important
means which were used by judges, as is narrated in the reports, books
and letters mentioned above. This is what 'Umar con6rmed in word
and deed, because he loved shoora so much even though he had a
great knowledge of Islam, and he rarely went ahead with anything
until after he had consulted the senior Sahribah and&qah~'.~"
It was narrated that ash-Sha'bi said: "Cases would be referred
to 'Umar and he would sometimes ponder them for a month,
consulting his companions."z23

2.5. Evidence on which the judge may rely
The evidence on which the judge may rely in passing d i n g s is:
1. Confession, and writing is regarded as a kind of confession.
2. Testimony: The judge is required to verify that witnesses are
qualified to testify. If he does not know them himself, then he should
ask them to bring someone who does know them. A man gave
testimony to 'Urnar and he said to him: "I do not know you, but it
does not matter that I do not know you. Bring me someone who does
know you." A man among the people said, "I know him." 'Umar
asked, "What do you know about him?" He said, "He is of good

character and is virtuous." He asked, "Is he your closest ncighbour
who you know by night and by day, and you know when he comes in
and goes out?" He said, "No." He asked, "Did he have any financial
dealings with you which is the way to know whether he is Godfearing or not?" He said, "No." He then asked, "Has he been your
companion on a journey, which is the way to know whether he is of
noble character and attitude?" He said, "No." He ('Umar) said,
"Then you do not know him."224
Testimony takes precedence over an oath whether that the
testimony is established before his opponent swears an oath or
afterwards. If the plaintiff asks the defendant to swear an oath and the
judge makes him do so, then the plaintiff brings proof after that
concerning his case, his evidence is to be accepted and the oath is to
be rejected. 'Umar said: "A false oath is more deserving of being
rejected than clear proof."225
The one who is to be asked to give testimony is the plainm.
'Umar wrote to Abu Moosa saying: "Proof is to be provided by the
plaintiff,and the oath is to be sworn by the one who denies."226If the
plaintiff has only one witness, his testimony should be accepted and
the plaintiff should also swear an oath. 'Umar used to pass judgement
in financial cases on the basis of an oath and a single witness.227

3. Oaths: The judge should not resort to asking the defendant to
swear an oath except when the plaintiff is unable to establish proof
and asks the defendant to swear an oath. If he swears an oath, then the
judge must rule according to that oath. 'Umar and Ubayy ibn Ka'b
referred to Zayd ibn Th2bit forjudgement concerning a garden which

Ubayy claimed was his. 'Umar had to swear an oath, and Zayd said:
"Let the Ameer al-Mu'mineen off." 'Umar said, "Why should he let
the Ameer al-Mu 'mineen off? If something belonged to me I would
be entitled to it by virtue of my oath, otherwise I would not lay claim
to it. By the One besides Whom there is no other god, this garden is
mine and Ubayy has no right to it." Afier the case was settled, he
gave the garden to Ubayy as a gift. It was said to him, "Why didn't
you give it to him before the oath?" He said, "I feared that if I did not
swear the oath, the people would not swear oaths for their rights aRer
me, and that would become the norm.""8
It is not permissible for one who has to swear an oath to refuse
to do so out of piety. We have seen above how 'Umar swore an oath,
then when he won his case he gave up his right.
In some cases 'Umar made the oaths cany greater weight by
making disputing parties swear oaths in a place which was deeply
venerated and respected by them, so that they would not dare to tell
lies in such a place. He made a group &om Murrah swear an oath in
the Hdr, and he made another group swear an oath between the Rukn
and the ~ a ~ r i m i m . " ~

4. Detecting family likenesses in cases determining lineage: This is
one of the kinds of strong circumstantial evidence that may form the
basis of a ruling. This is indicated by the Sunnah of the Pmphet @)
and the actions of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the Sahribah. use
of such evidence in rulings was approved of by 'Umar ibn alKhagb, Ibn 'Abbb and others.230

5. Circumstantial evidence: Circumstantial evidence covers a broad
category which judges use their intelligence to derive. Examples of
strong circumstantial evidence include a woman's pregnancy when
she has never been married; this is regarded as evidence of zind.
Another example is giving birth before the usual length of pregnancy
is over. Yet another example is the presence of two dead persons, one
of top of the other. This situation provides strong circumstantial
evidence that the one who died first is the one on the bottom, and the
one who died last is the one on top. Hence during the plague of
'AmwG, when the hand or foot of one dead person was on top of
another, 'Umar ruled that the one on top was the heir of the one on the
bottom, and that the one on the bottom could not be the heir of the
one on top.

An example of circumstantial evidence in the case of drinking
alcohol is the presence of wine in a person's vomit. 'Umar carried out
the hadd punishment for drinking on a person in whose vomit wine
was found23i
6. Prior knowledge on the part of the judge: Prior knowledge of the
judge with regard to hadd punishments is not regarded as evidence
i
m to issue a judgement against the accused. 'Umar
which entitles h
wrote to Abu Moosa al-Ash'ari telling him that an Imam should not
rule on the basis of his knowledge, speculation or suspicion.23z

He asked 'Abdur-Ra!mh ibn ' A d 'What do you think if I
saw a man kill, steal or commit zinb?" He said, "I think that your
testimony is like that of any other Muslim man." 'Umar said, "You
are right."233

With regard to hudood punishments, there are various reports
&om 'Umar regarding the prior knowledge of the judge and whether
that is sufficient knowledge for the judge to pass judgement on that
basis if there is no other evidence ava11able.2~~
However 'Umar was
keen not to encourage the people to confess their sins, rather he
wanted them to repent and to keep the matter between them and
Allah. S h m b e e l ibn as-Sam? al-Kindi, who was guarding the
border near al-Mamin, addressed the people and said: "0' people,
you are in a land where drinking is widespread and there are many
women. If any one of you commits a crime that deserves a hadd
punishment, let him come to us so that we may carry out the
punishment on him, for that will be his purification." News of that
reached 'Umar and he wrote to him saying: "It is not permissible for
you to tell the people to remove the concealment of Allah Who has
concealed them. "z35
But if the people referred the matter for judgement, then it was
the state that carried out hadd punishments without any l e n i e n ~ e . 2 ~ ~
When 'Umar wanted to pass a judgement between two
disputants, he would recite the following du '6 ': "0' Allah, if You
know when two disputants sit before me that I am worried in the
slightest about who is at fault, then do not withhold the punishment
fiom me for an instant."237

2.6. Rulings and punishments meted out by
'Umar for some crimes and misdemeanours
2.6.1. Forging of the official seal of the state
During 'Umar's caliphate a serious event took place which had
not taken place before. Ma'n ibn Z2idah managed to forge the seal of
the state by engraving something similar, which he used to take
money from the bayt al-mcil of the Muslims. The case was referred to
'Umar, who had him beaten one hundred times and imprisoned.
Someone tried to intercede on his behalf, and he had him beaten
another hundred times. Someone else tried to intercede on his behalf
and he had h i beaten a further hundred times and banished.z3*

2.6.2. A man who stole from the bayt al-mlil in Koofah
'Umar did not cut off the hand of one who stole from the bayt
al-mcil. Ibn Mas'ood asked 'Urnar about a man who stole from the
bayt al-mcil and he said: "Let him go, for there is no one who does not
have a right to this wealth."z39 But he had him whipped as a fa ieer
punishment?40

2.6.3. Theft during the year of ar-Raddah
During the year of ar-Ramidah, the slaves of H2tib ibn Abi
Balta'ah stole a camel belonging to a Muzani man, which they
slaughtered and ate. The matter was referred to 'Umar, who went
after the slaves, and they admitted that they had stolen it from its
proper place, and that those who had stolen it were adults of sound

mind; they made no claim of necessity that compelled them to steal.
'Umar ordered Katheer ibn as-Salt to cut off their hands but because he was living through the year of ar-Ramidah and he saw
what the people were going through -he looked for an excuse for
them. He said to their master: "I think that you are starving them."
That was all he did in this case. He waived the punishment of
amputation and he ordered that the Muzani man be given a camel of
twice the value (800 d i r h a m s ) . Thus they were protected from the
hadd punishment because of ne~essity.~"

"'

2.6.4. An insane woman who committed zini?
An insane woman who had committed zin6 was brought to
'Umar. He consulted the people then he commanded that she he
stoned. 'Ali ibn Abi ralib passed by and said: "Take her back!" Then
he came to 'Umar and said, "Do you not know that the Pen has been
lifted...?" and he quoted the hadith. At the end of it he said, "Yes."
'Ali said, "Then why should she be stoned? Let her go."243 And
'Umar started to say takbeerT4

Muslim woman to commit zini

2.6.6. Forcing women to commit zini
Some slave women who had been forced by some slave men to
commit zinri were brought to 'Umar. He beat the men but he did not
beat the women.246
A woman who had committed zind was brought to 'Umar and
she said: "I was sleeping and when I woke up there was a man on top
of me." He let her go and did not beat her.247

In these cases where there was some uncertainty, the hadd
punishments were waived. No distinction was made between
physical force and threats to kill. During 'Umar's caliphate, a woman
asked a shepherd for water, but he refused to give it to her unless she
let him have his way with her. She did that, and the matter was
referred to 'Umar. He asked 'Ali: "What do you think about her?" He
said, "She was forced." So 'Umar gave her something and let her go.

2.6.7. Ruling on one who was ignorant
of the prohibition on zind
It was narrated &om Sa'eed ibn al-Musayyib that an agent of
'Umar ibn a l - K h a ~ bwrote to 'Umar telling him that a man had
admitted to him that he had committed z i n i . 'Umar wrote to him,

and he only said that after they had argued and traded insults. What
'Umar (&) did is regarded as a means by which he wanted to
discipline the foolish and protect the honour of the innocent. This is a
wise policy which does not go against any text of the Qur'an and
Snnnah, rather it is in accordance with the spirit of ~ h a r i ' a h . ~ ~ ~

2.6.14. Regarding as insigruficant the blood of a
Jew who impugned the honour of others
At the time of 'Umar, there were two young righteous men
who were as close as brothers. One of them went out to join the jihad,
and he asked his brother to look after his family. One night he went to
check on his brother's family and he saw a lamp burning in the house,
and there was a Jew in the house with his brother's wife, reciting lines
of provocative verse.
The young man went back to his own house and fetched a
sword, then he entered his brother's wife and killed the Jew, whom he
then stripped and threw into the street. The next morning they found
the body and no one knew who had killed him. They went to 'Umar
ibn al-Khagib and told him about that. 'Umar called out to the
people: "as-Saldtu Jlimi'ah (prayer is about to begin)." The people
gathered, then 'Umar ascended the minbar; he praised and glorified
Allah, then he said, "I adjure by Allah any man who knows anything
about this body to tell me about it." The young man stood up and told
'Umar about what had happened. 'Umar said, "May Allah protect
your hands," and he regarded it as legitimate to have shed his
blood.259

'Umar ibn al-Khaffrib

527

2.6.15. No diyah is to be paid for
one who was killed by Allah
'Abdur-Razz% narrated in his Mqannaf, and al-Bayhaqi
narrated in his Sunan, that a man hosted some people from Hudhayl.
They sent a slave woman to fetch some frewood, and the host was
attracted to her, so he followed her and wanted to have his way with
her, but she refused. He wrestled with her for a while, then she
escaped ftom him and threw a rock at him and killed him. Then she
came to her masters and told them what had happened. Her masters
went to 'Umar and told him, and 'Umar sent investigatorswho found
their tracks. 'Umar said: 'Wo diyah is to be paid for one who was
killed by Allah." He regarded it as legitimate to have shed the blood
or diyah, and no
of that aggressor, so there was to be no qi&
expiation was to be offered.

2.6.16. If all the people of San'2 were to take part
in a murder, he would execute all of them
It was narrated £?om Ibu 'Umar (&) that a boy was murdered
and 'Umar said: "If all the people of San'i' (Sana) had taken part in
that, I would execute them." According to another report, four men
killed a boy and 'Umar said: "If all the people of San'i' had taken
part in that, I would execute them."260 There is no text on this ruling
in the Qur'an and Sunnah, and there is no report that Abu Bakr
passed any such ruling, rather 'Umar based his ruling on his
understanding of the aims of shari'ah and the d i n g aimed at
preserving the security and stability of society. ~loodshedis no
insignificant matter, hence justice, the interests of the ummah and the
aims of shari'ah dictate that retaliation (q@&)should be carried out if

it is proven that they all took part in the killing. This is the view of the
majority of scholars, including the four Imams, Sa'eed ibn alMusayyib, al-Hasan, Abu Salamah, 'AM', Qa-,
ath-Thawn', alAwzi'i and others.261 This opinion is more correct and is more

2.6.21. Making the hadd punishment
for drinking alcohol eighty lashes
When 'Umar became caliph and the Islamic conquestsbecame
widespread, people's situation improved and the Muslims spread out.
Many people entered Islam but they did not receive a sufficient
Islamic education and learn to understand the religion properly like
those who had come before them. So wine-drinking became
widespread among the people and this was a problem that 'Umar
faced. He gathered the senior SahBbah together and consulted them
about the matter. They agreed to bring the hadd punishment up to
eighty lashes, and this was the least severe of the hadd punishments.
He acted upon that and none of the SahBbah went against that during
his
Ibn al-Qayyim stated that Kh%d ibn al-Waleed sent
Wabarah q-Saleeti from Syria to 'Umar. He said: 'I came to him and
Tabah, az-Zubayr ibn al-'Awwh and 'Abdur-RaJjmh ibn 'Awf
were with him, reclining in the mosque. I asked him, 'Kh%d ibn alWaleed sends saldms to you and says that the people are indulging in
wine and are not wonying about the punishment; what do you
think?' 'Umar said, 'Here they are (the people who can gave you an
answer).' 'Ali said, 'I think that when a person gets drunk,he does
not know what be is saying, and if he does not know what he is
saying, he will tell lies, and the liar deserves eighty lashes.' They
agreed on that, so 'Umar said, 'Tell your companion what they said.'
So Khilid gave eighty lashes, and 'Umar gave eighty lashes."272

2.6.22. Burning taverns where wine was served
It was narrated from Yahya ibn Sa'eed, from 'Ubaydull%h llnom

house of a man of Thaqeef, and he ordered that it be burned. The man
was called Ruwayshid ('wise') and 'Urnar said: "You areficwaysiq
('evildoer'). "273
Ibn al-Jawzi said: "Burned" means that 'Umar burned the house of
Ruwayshid ath-Thaqafi; it was a tavern (where wine was served). Ibn
al-Qayyim said: " 'Umar ibn al-Khacib burned taverns with
everything in them, and he burned a village where wine was sold.274

2.6.23. Marry her off as a chaste Muslim woman
A man came to 'Umar and said: "I have a daughter whom I
buried alive during the Jiihiliyah, then we dug her up before she died.
She came to know of Islam and became Muslim, then she did
something that deserves one of the hadd punishments of Allah. She
took a knife to kill herself, hut we caught her when she had cut some
of her veins. We looked after her until she recovered, then she
repented sincerely and now some people are proposing maniage to
her. Should I tell them what happened?" 'Umar (&) said, "Would
you deliberately disclose that which AUah has concealed? By Allah,
if you tell anyone about her situation, I will make an example of you
to the people of all regions. Marry her off as a chaste Muslim
woman."275

Financial and Judiciary InstiEutions at the nrne of 'Umar

a)

Prophet
said: "Choose four." When 'Umar was the caliph,
Ghaylin divorced his wives and divided his wealth among his sons.
News of that reached 'Umar ibn al-Khagb, who sent for him.When
he came to him, 'Umar said to him. "I think that the Shaytin may
have heard something about your death and has informed you that
you are going to die, and that is why you did what you did. By Allah,
I believe that soon after you leave me, you are going to die. By Allah,
if you die before you take back your wives and take back your
wealth, I will give your wives a share of your wealth, then I will stone
your grave and make it like the grave of Abu Raghghil." So he took
back his wives -as he had not divorced them irrevocably -and he
took back the wealth that he had divided among his sons, and soon
after that, he died.276

2.6.25. Minimum and maximum length of pregnancy
A woman was brought to 'Umar whose pregnancy had lasted
six months, and 'Umar wanted to stone her, but her sister came to
'Ali and said: "Umar wants to stone my sister; I adjure you by Allah,
if you know of any way out for her, tell me about it." 'Ali said,
"There is a way out for her." She said takbeer so loudly that 'Umar
and those who were with him heard it. She went to 'Umar and said,
"Ali says that there is a way out for my sister.'"Urnar sent word to
'Ali, asking, "What is the way out?" 'Ali said, "Allah (&) says,

dThe mothers shall give suck to their children fortwo whole years...)
(Qur 'an 2: 233)

And He also says,

d... And the bearing of him, and the weaning of him is thlrty
months...8
(Qur 'an 46: 15)
276 Mmsoo ht Fiqh

'Umar, p. 47.

'Umar ibn al-Khatfdb

533

So pregnancy is six mouths and weaning is twenty-four months." So
'Umar let her go.
And a child may remain in his mother's womb for more than
nine months. A woman was brought to 'Umar whose husband had
been away for two years, then he came back and found her pregnant.
'Umar wanted to stone her, but Mu'idh ibn Jabal said: "0'Ameer alMu'mineen, even if you have a case against her, you do not have a
case against the one who is in her womb." So 'Umar left her until she
had given birth to a boy whose teeth were already present, and her
husband realized that the child looked like him. 'Umar said, "Women
can no longer give birth to sons like Mu'&. Were it not for Mu'iidh,
'Umar could have made a fatal rni~take."~"
It seems that 'Umar thought that the maximum length of
pregnancy was four years, because he ruled that the wife of one who
was missing should wait for four years, then she should observe the
'iddah of a woman whose husband has died. Ibn Qudhah said,
"Quoting 'Urnar's vlew on that, that the one whose husband is
missing should wait for four years, the maxmum length of
pregnancy, then she should observe the 'iddah of one whose husband
has died, four months and ten days, afler which it becomes
permissible for her to many.""s

2.7. Restrictions on personal possessions
so that they will not be abused

his time and which indicates that the public interest takes precedence
over private interests and that restrictions should be placed on

personal possessions so that they will not be abused, is narrated by
MSlik in al-Muwafta ':
It was narrated h m 'Amr ibu Y@ya al-Mkini, fiom his father, that
ad-D&i& ibn Khaleefah wanted to dig a ditch that would bring
water ftom al-'Areed, and he wanted to bring it through the land of
Muhammad ibn Maslamah, but Muhammad refused. Ad-D&%
said to him, "Why are you preventing me when it will benefit yon
too? You will drink ftom it fvst and last and it will not do you any
harm." But Muhammad refused. Ad-?&% spoke to 'Umar ibn alKhaMb about that. 'Umar ibn al-KhaMb summoned Muhammad ibn
Maslamah and told him to let
dig the ditch, but
Muhammad said no. 'Umar said, "Why won't you let your brother do
something that will benefit h i and will also benefit you, for you will
take water ftom it fimt and last and it will not do you any harm."
Muhammad said, "No, by Allah." 'Umar said, "By Allah, he is going
to bring it even if that is over your belly." 'Umar ordered him to bring
the water, and a@-D&i& did that.z79
Here 'Umar was drawing an analogy with the hadith of Abu
Hwayrah, according to which the Prophet &)said: cc"No one of you
should prevent his neighbour from fixing a piece of wood to his
wall.",,
The case in which 'Umar passed this ruling was clearer,
because the Prophet &) forbade a neighbour to prevent his
ueighbour ftom fixing a piece of wood to his wall; even though such
an action will not harm a neighbour, it will not benefit him either,
whereas bringing water does two things: it benefits the neighbour and
d and Ibriheem
it does not harm him. So this case is clearer. b
thought that 'Umar ruled in this case by what is known nowadays as
279 See al-Muwoffa', Kitrib Is'rif al-Mabca' bi Rija^l al-Mmafga', Pp. 638-639;

a l - M w t a : 2/746.

'Umar ibn al-Khaftdb

535

the basic principles of justice.280
'Abdus-Salh as-Sulaymihi thought that it comes under the
heading of what is known nowadays in western law as abusing one's
rights. This is a definition that the Muslims reached several centuries
before the west, and that was based on the hadith of Abu Hurayrah
which is quoted above, which 'Umar applied to every case where
what a neighbour needs is something that will also benefit the house
and land of his neighbour. Others were of the view that it is not
permissible to do that except with the neighbour's permission.281
From this incident we may note the following points:

1. That this incident comes under the heading ofjudgements based on
'Umar's ijtihad, because he passed judgement based on @-D&%'s
complaint which he bought to 'Umar after Muhammad ibn
Maslamah refused to respond to a request that had been presented to
him in a fiiendly manner, after which he was summoned to come to
'Umar.
2. 'Umar's ruling in this case was not haphazard, rather he
investigated the matter and examined the circumstances, and made
sure that the opponent was indeed refusing to allow the water to pass
through his land, which was an attitude for which there was no
justification, because allowing the water to pass would not cause any
harm to the defendant on the contrary he would benefit greatly from
it and the interests of both parties would be served. As this was the
case, his r e h a 1 formed a barrier to the common interest and came
under the category of abusing one's rights. 'Umar did not take the
matter of achieving the common interest for all members of the
-ah
lightly.

3. 'Umar spoke kindly to Muhammad ibn Maslamah, reminding him
of Islamic brotherhood, in an attempt to convince him to change his
mind. When this kindness was met with a blunt refusal accompanied
by an oath, an attitude which implied a challenge to the authority of
the caliph and a refusal to submit to his rule, 'Umar's response was
tough and came at the right level, as befitted his responsibility to
protect the authority of the caliphate which he was only using to
achieve the interests of all Muslims and protect their rights.282

2.8. Allowing a threefold divorce
with one utterance
It was narrated that Ibn 'Abbis said: ((''At the time of the
Messenger of Allah @@and Abu Bakr, and for the first two years of
'Umar's caliphate, the pronouncement of three divorces in one was
regarded as one. Then 'Umar ibn al-Kha@b said, 'The people are
being hasty with regard to something in which they should take their
time. It would be better for us to let it stand (i.e., to let it count as three
divorces),' so he let it stand."))283It was narrated that ((Abu qSahba' asked Ibn 'Abb2s: "Do you know that three divorces at once
used to be counted as one during the time of the Prophet @) and
Abu Bakr and for tbree years of 'Umar's reign?" Ibn 'Abbk said,
~es.'s."~~
According to these two reports, 'Umar ibn al-Khasb ruled
that that counted as a threefold divorce, unlike the practice at the time
of the Messenger of Allah 0 and the time of Abu Bakr q-Siddeeq,
when three divorces uttered in one go counted as a single divorce.
Al-OtihUfee al-Fiqh al-Isldini, 4. 141, 142.
283 Muslim, Kifrib at-@I&, hadith no. 1472.
284 Ibid.

'Umar ibn al-KhaBa^b

537

'Umar justified this punishment by noting that the practice of uttering
a three-fold divorce in one go
- was on the rise, and he wanted to bring
the people back to the form of divorce that is outlined in the Sunnah,
which is prescribed by Allah, which is that the man should pronounce
one divorce, then leave her (the wife) until she has completed her
'iddah; then if he wants to take her back as his wife, he may do so
before the 'iddah ends, and so on, until the three divorces (talriq)
have been completed.285
Some people regarded this action of 'Umar's as m
g
contrary to the texts, such as Dr. 'Atiyah Musafa Mushrifah, who
said: "Umar had the audacity to follow his opinion even if that went
against some of the texts and principles that were known and had
previously been followed, so that the new rnling would be more
suited to the new Muslim society."286 One example that is given is
letting the threefold divorce uttered in one go count as three
divorces.287The tmth of the matter is that by doing this, 'Umar did
not go against the definitive texts, rather he was striving to
understand the texts, because there are some reports which support
his view.
1. Maik nanated from Ashhab from al-Qkim ibn 'Abdulliih that
Y*ya ibn Sa'eed told him that Ibn Shihib told him, that Ibn alMusayyib toidhim, that: "A man from Aslam divorced his wife at the
time of the Messenger of Allah (Blessings and peace be upon him)
with three divorces. Some of the Sahribah (Companions of the
Prophet) said to him, 'You have the right to take her back.' But his
wife went to the Messenger of Allah @) and said, 'My husband
divorced me with three divorces in one go.' The Messenger of Allah

After quoting the above, we see that the caliph 'Urnarbased
his decision on evidence kom the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah
&),and that by allowing a divorce that was uttered three times in
one go to count as a threefold divorce, he was not introducing an
innovation that he had made up. Many of the Sahribah agreed with
his opinion, such as 'Uthmiin ibn 'Affm, 'Ali ibn Abi Tilib,
'Abdullih ibn 'Abbh and 'Abdullih ibn Mas'ood - who are
mentioned in more than one report -and 'huhibn Husayn. Based
on this, the issue of whether the threefold divorce uttered in one go
counts as such, or whether it counts when a man says words such as
"You are thrice divorced," 'You are divorced and divorced and
divorced," or "You are divorced three times, or ten times, or a
hundred times, or a thousand times" and so on, is a matter that is
subject to the ijtihad of the ruler, according to whether he thinks it is
best at that time and in that place for it to count as a threefold divorce
or as a single, revocable, divorce.z9z
Ibn al-Qayyim (may Allah have mercy on him) said:
=said: This is more saheeh than the hadith of Jurayj which says that Rakkah
divorced his wife three times, because they were members of his family and he
h e w them better. An-Nawawi said: As for the differing report which says that
Rakbah divorced his wife thee times and made it one, it is a da'eef report
which is narrated fiom unknown (majhool) people. The correct report is that
which is quoted above, which says that he divorced her irrevocably (al-baitah),
and the word al-bait& may mean once or thrice. Sharh an-Nawawi, 10/71.

" 'Umar was not dissenting fi-om the consensus of those who had
come before him, rather he thought that they should be forced to
adhere to the threefold divorce as a punishment to them, because they
knew that it was harem but they persisted in doing it. Undoubtedly it
is acceptable for rulers to force people to go through with what they
have brought upon themselves by not accepting the concession
granted by Allah.293

2.9. Prohibition of mut'ah marriage
(Temporary marriage)
It is reported that 'Umar ibn al-KhaEih (&) forbade mut 'ah
maniage and was emphatic in doing so; he regarded it as zinc? which
was punishable by stoning in the case of one who was previouslymarried. Some people think that the one who forbade mut'ah was
'Umar ibn al-Kha@b, not the Messenger of Allah (g).It was
narrated that Abu N a a h said: "Ibn 'Abbis used to enjoin mut 'ah,
and Ibn az-Zubayr used to forbid it." He said, "I mentioned that to
Jibbir ibn 'Abdullih and he said, 'I know about this issue. We engaged
in mut'ah at the time of the Messenger of Allah
then when
'Umar became caliph he said, 'Allah used to permit whatever He
wanted to His Messenger as He willed. Now the Qur'an has been
revealed and completed, so complete Hajj and 'Umrah as Allah has
commanded you, and formalize your mamage with those women
(with whom you entered into temporary marriages), for if any man
who has married a woman for a certain period is brought to me, I will
stone him'.' "294

Messenger of Allah @), and that the one who forbade it was 'Umar
ibn al-Khaeb. The reports which imply that mut 'ah was permitted at
the time of the Messenger of Allah (&) and he did not forbid it, and
that it was also permitted at the time of Abu Bakr, and that the one
who forbade mut 'ah after it had been permitted was 'Umar ibn alKhagb. were mentioned in Muslim and in the Musannaf of 'AbdurRaz*. But in fact the one who forbade mut 'ah was the Messenger
ofAllah
Those Sahribah who are described as regarding mut'ah
as permissible had not heard of the definitive prohibition by the
Messenger of Allah &). Similarly those later scholars who
amibuted the prohibition of mut 'ah to 'Umar ibn al-Khagb without
any evidence to that effect, such as Abu Hi12 al-'~skar?'~and
' , unaware of the evidence concerning that
Rafeeq a l - ' ~ ~ ' ~were
from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah @), which was the basis
on which 'Umar forbade mut 'ah.

There follow some ahrideeth which were narrated from the
Messenger of Allah &),kom which we understand that he forbade
mut 'ah:
1. Muslim narrated that Salamah said: <<"TheMessenger of Allah
&) granted a concession during the year of A*
allowing mut 'ah
for three (days), then he forbade
2. Muslim narrated that Sabrah said: ((The Messenger of Allah @J
gave us permission to engage in mut 'ah, so another man and I went to
a woman h m Banu ' h i r , who was young and beautiful, and
proposed mut'ah marriage to her. She asked, "What will you give

companion's cloak was finer than mine, but I was younger than him.
When she looked at my companion's cloak, she hked it, but when she
looked at me, she liked me. Then she said, "You and your cloak are
sufficient for me." I stayed with her for three (days), then the
said: "Whoever has any of these women

with him with whom he has engaged m mut'ah, he should let her

3. Muslim narrated h m Sabrah al-Juhani, that: ((He was with the
Messenger of Allah &)and he said: "0' people, I had given you
permission to engage in mut'ah with women, but now Allah has
forbidden that until the Day of Resurrection. So whoever has any
such woman with him, he should let her go, and do not take back
anything that you gave to them."^^^^
4. Muslim narrated from 'Ali ibn Abi T2ib that: (<Heheard Ihn
'Abbzs being lenient with regard to mut'ah. He said, "Wait a minute,
0' Ibn 'Abbh. The Messenger of Allah - forbade it on the day of
Khaybar, and he forbade the meat of domestic donkeys."),z99

a)

'Umar did not introduce the prohibition on mut 'ah kom his
own ideas, rather he was following the Messenger of Allah &) when
he forbade it permanently during the year of the conquest of Makkah
in 8 A.H., after he had forbidden it at Khaybar in 6 A.H., then
permitted it during the year of the Conquest, when the people
engaged in mut'ah for fifteen days, then the Prophet @) forbade it
until the Day of ~ e s u r r e c t i o n . ~ ~ ~

2.10. Fiqhi views favoured by 'Umar (&)
'Urnar influenced the judicial system with his ijtihad
concerning qi&,
hadd punishments, crimes and ta 'zeer
punishments. He also played a role in the development of the
schools of fiqh with his ijtihad which is indicative of the depth of his
knowledge and understanding of the aims of shari'ah. There are
many view in fiqh for which he expressed a preference; there follow
some examples:
1.'Umar (4)
was of the view that the skin of a dead animal may be
purified by means of tanning, if it was pure when it was &ve.
2. 'Umar (&) was of the view that it is makrooh to pray wearing fox
skins.
3. 'Umar (&) was of the view that it is not makrooh for a fasting
person to use the siwcik after the sun has passed its zenith; rather it is
mustahabb.

allowed for one day and night in the case of a non-traveller, and three
days and nights in the case of a traveller.

agreement for all kinds of trees.
19. Abu Bakr and 'Umar were of the view that it is permissible to hire

20. 'Umar was of the view that a gift is not irrevocable until it has
been acquired.
21. He was of the view that a gift given to someone other than a
relative may be taken back unless one has been rewarded for it, but
whoever gives a gift to a relative has no right to take it back.

22. He was of the view that the period for announcing lost property is
one year.
23. He was of the view that it is permissible to take and use lost
property that is of insignificant value, without announcing it.
24. 'Umar was of the view that if a person has announced lost
property for the proper length of time and he does not know who it
belongs to, then it becomes like the rest of his possessions, whether
he is rich or poor.

found inside or outside the sanctuary.
26. He was of the view that the foundling should stay with the one

29. He was of the view that if there are sisters and daughters, they are

30. If there is a husband, a mother, siblings through the mother, and
siblings through the father and mother, this is an issue of inheritance
concerning which the scholars differed in the past and in modem
times. It is narrated that 'Umar, 'Uthm2n and Zayd ibn Thibit (may
Allah be pleased with them all) allocated one-thkd to be shared

546

Financial and Judiciaiy Institutions at the lime of 'Umar

among the children of both parents and the children of the mother,
with each male getting the share of two females.

31. He was of the view that grandmothers should get one-sixth, even
if they are many. This is the view of Abu Bakr.
32. 'Umar was of the view that if there are a mother, a sister and a
grandfather, the sister gets one-half, the mother gets one-third ofwhat
is left, and the grandfather gets what is left.

33. 'Umar was of the view that if there is a husband and two parents,
the husband should be given half, the mother one-third of what is left
and the father gets whatever is left. If there are a wife and two parents,
the wife is given one-quarter, the mother is given one-third of what is
left and the father gets whatever is left.
These two issues are known as al-'Umariyatayn, because 'Umar
gave these rulings.
34. He was of the view that relatives should be given some of the
inheritance if they are not entitled to a specific share.302

These are some of the views favoured by 'Umar in the field of
fiqh. They deserve further study and examination, as I have only
mentioned them in brief here.
