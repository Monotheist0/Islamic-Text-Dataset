Publishers Note

We are presenting before you the History of Islam in three volumes.
This book was originally written in the Urdu language in 1922 (1343
AH) by Akbar Shah Khan Najeebabadi. This was the time about 25
years before the partition of Indian Subcontinent into Pakistan and
India . For the purpose of brevity, the compiler has presented the
authentic events in concise form from the famous histories of Islam
written in the Arabic and Persian languages by the great Muslim
historians like Tabari, lbn Athir, Mas'udi, Abul-Fida', lbn Khaldfm
and Suyuti, apart from getting benefited from the authentic books of
Ahadith for the compilation of the part about the biography of the
Prophet Muhammad gj&. So, this compilation is actually the extract of
the works of the famous Muslim historians.
Although Islam, the religion of Allah, has been sent from the
beginning with Adam ~ I, the father of man, but it is recognized as
the religion which our Prophet Muhammad gJ& brought to the
mankind. So, this compilation has the mention of our Prophet gJ& in
the start. After that, useful information has been added about history,
its beginning and its benefits, and some mention of the best possible
ruling system for mankind has been presented which Islam advocates.
Then the book takes its course of history from the conditions

6

The History of Islam

prevalent in Arabia before Islam, and moves forward to the Prophet's
life history, the Rightly-Guided Caliphate and then to the other
caliphates and kingdoms after it.
This book was the need of the time to present the true Islamic events
and their actual causes before the English readers because other books
in English found on the Islamic history have been written by such
authors and compilers who did no justice in presenting the true
picture of Islamic Era but their prejudice prevented them from doing
so.
We hope that the readers will find this compilation of great help in
the study of Islamic history. The famous scholar Safi-ur-Rahman
Mubarakpuri has revised the Urdu edition before its translation to
check the authenticity aspect.
The translation was done by the Translation Department of
Darussalam, and every care has been taken to reproduce the events
and the names of the persons and places as accurately as possible. We
lhank all the persons who have cooperated with us to complete this
task and produce it before you into a presentable form . May Allah
accept our humble efforts in this regard and send His peace and
blessings on our Prophet Muhammad, his Companions and his
followers.-Amin!

There is no God except Allah
A glance at world history makes it clear beyond doubt that, in every
country of the world and in every age, all the Prophets, reformers,
guides and founders of religions had belief in one God, and all of
them made all-out efforts to convince their people of the existence of
one Elevated Creator. Although Adam, Nfm (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham),
Musa (Moses) ~ \ and Muhammad ~ lived in ages hundreds and
thousands of years far from one another, but their teachings had
Oneness of the Creator as the common factor.
Krishnji, Ramchandraji, Gautama Buddha and Guru Nanak happened
to be in India; Kaiqbad and Zoroaster in Iran; Confucius in China,
Luqman in Greece; Yusuf (Joseph) ~ I in Egypt; Lut ~ \ in Syria and
Palestine - but Oneness of God lies at the base of the teachings of all.
Almost all men and children, old and young, male and female,
Christians and Jews etc., believe in Allah the Almighty. May be, some
people in very small number, refuse to utter the name of God but
within their hearts they too feel His Presence. They have to admit that
this process of cause and effect goes on created and supervised by
some power wise to the extreme. This Wise and Well-Intentioned One
is known as Allah the Almighty.

None but the insane can reject the unanimous belief of the men of
intellect and the magnificent creation of Allah the Almighty.

Muhammad ti; is the Messenger of Allah
The magnificent kingdom of Rome had already been broken into
pieces and its semi-brute laws and constitution had become distorted
enough to wipe out whatever good points happened to be therein.
Persian Empire had become the storehouse of corruption and atrocities;
China and Turkistan appeared to be the haven of bloodshed and
ferocity; in India, the administrations of Asoka and Kanishka were
non-existent: none could even think of the reign of Maharaja
Vikarmajeet, nor was there any model of Buddhism nor of
Brahmanism.
Those paying respects to Buddha would commit amply shameful acts
for the sake of power and worldly comforts or out of weakness in
belief. Those reading the rosary of Shri Krishn had no hesitation in
making men the most honorable among the created things to
prostrate before the vegetables and the stones. If Europe was like a
forest with its men as bloodthirsty and ferocious as the beasts, the
whole of Arabia had been reduced to the state of animality. In short,
nowhere in the world human race appeared sticking to its pure
quality of humanness and nobility. In a situation when the entire
world had turned dark and dismal, it was the duty of the people of
India to ponder over the fourth chapter of Gita where Shri Krishn
Maharaj says:
"O Arjun! Whenever faith falls in jeopardy and faithlessness
grows, [ provide safety to the virtuous and establish faith by
wiping the evils out."
rt was the sheer duty of the Persians to come out in search of a guide
as per the dictates of Zoroaster. It was for the Jews to wait for the
appearance of the light from the peaks of the Faran range and held
themselves back from stopper stone becoming the cornerstone. It was
the bounden duty of the Christians to make the prayer of Ibrahim
(Abraham) and the glad tidings of Jesus, center of their hope. But the
global corruption and disruption and all-round darkness had caused

22

The History of Islam

human eyes to become so dark and blind that nobody was conscious
enough to take himself to be ailing and go ahead for any medicine.
In such an age and in a territory like Arabia, Muhammad :i rose to
remove the mischief of polytheism, darkness of idolatry, pollution of
corruption and disruption and defilement of vices and shamelessness,
and raising the voice of La il!iha illall!ih, he performed his singular and
sacred duty of making men out of men-like people, and men to be
men of high morals, and such noble people to be men of God to change
darkness into light, righteousness, peace, uprightness and virtue; and
carve pure Muslims out of the deviated, idolaters and evil persons.
Nuh ~ 1 was forced by the circumstances to do them away with the
sword of "My Lord! Leave not one of the disbelievers on the earth!"
(71:26) after his relentless efforts of hundreds of years to bring the
deviated people of Iraq and Arabia back to the right path. Musa ~I
tried hard to show the Egyptians and the arrogant king the right path
but at last, Musa (Moses) ~I and Children of Israel saw the sight
about which the noble Qur'an then said:
" ... and drowned Pharaoh's people while you were looking (at
them, when the sea-water covered them)." (2:50)

It is for this that Maharaja Ramchandraji invaded Lanka and fought
with the demons, and Shri Krishn Maharaj persuaded Arjun to fight
in the battlefield of Krukshetra, and had to destroy the defying Kurus
at the hands of the Pandus. In Iran, Zoroaster made the wrestling of
Isphandiyar and the Empire of Kiyani the base of his preaching and
propagation of his faith.
But ancient scriptures and sociological traditions reaching the erudite
scholars are unanimous that all the revered founders of religions and
honorable guides in the way of righteousness have no example to
show that, in a short span of less than 25 years, the worst country and
the ignorant and brute people became the teacher and the most
civilized and well-mannered people on the earth. In less than a
hundred years, i.e., in 80 years only the followers of the Faith brought
by Muhammad :i encompassed an area ranging from Atlantic Ocean
to Pacific Ocean, i.e., up to the eastern coast of China, and, to say, the
whole of the civilized world. This world of ours cannot present any

Foreword

23

other example of this miraculous success. And if the teaching of Islam
is superior to all other religious codes and doctrines for its supreme
qualities, who can then question the status of Muhammad 1i, being
the best of all mankind, the Seal of the Prophets and the Mercy for the
world? And who can muster courage to challenge the Divine claim for
the Glorious Qur'an brought by the Prophet~ to be matchless and
irrefutable? As the Qur'an says:
"Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (the Qur'an)
and surely, We will guard it (from corruption)." (15:9)
History stands as the most effective and valuable source of putting
nations on the course of progress and prosperity and saving them
from the path of disgrace and degradation. Whenever nations have
gone up to great heights, they have achieved inspiration from nothing
but history.
The Noble Qur'an has also told us that the study of history was quite
essential for human grace and success in this world and the Hereafter.
The events of the past nations remind us that such and such nations
bore the brunt of their evil deeds while some others achieved grand
success on account of their good deeds. Events of Adam, Nuh,
Ibrahim, Musa and others and the plights of Pharaoh, Nimrod, Ad,
Thamud etc., have not been mentioned in the Noble Qur'an for the
sake of amusement and entertainment and to bring about sleep, but
for producing in us courage to perform good deeds and keep away
from misdeeds, and changing our present into bright future.
The Prophets who have happened to be the greatest well-wishers and
most affectionate of all for mankind, have always reminded them of
their past history to save them from destruction. None among the
great leaders and reformers of the world appears to have ignored the
past conditions and events in bringing about alertness and
consciousness among the unconscious and self-denying people of
their times. It is because of this, every sermonizer or speaker has
recourse to interesting historical events to encourage and activate
their audience. Among the past heroes too, we refer those who are
closely related to us nationally and religiously, and they exert more
influence on our lives. The study of the lives and deeds of Rustam,

24

The History of Islam

Isphandiyar and Gustap can arouse sense of religious zeal, justice and
equity more for the Iranians and Parsees than the Jains or Indians.
Similarly the stories of Bhim, Arjun, Vikarmajeet and Prithivi Raj
influence the Hindus far more than the Christians.
Today, when they have become aware of the influences and
consequences of the histories of nations and the fact has come to light
that this is the only way of bringing a nation back to life and keep it
alive, we see with our naked eyes that those nations which are bereft
of glorious histories, present concocted stories and fabricated fictions
in the name of their histories studded with sparkling events and
scintillating accounts ~o fill the minds and hearts of the individuals
and youths of their nations so that they come to believe them.
These shameless efforts of transforming wrong into right go on just
for the sake of convincing their people of their past grandeur without
which no nation could be aroused to compete with others in the race
of achieving excellence in various fields of human life and
development. This is the reason why the nation antagonistic and
hostile to another one tries to distort its history and render its men
ignorant of and careless about their history.

Magnificent Deeds of the Muslims
Among the nations of the world, Muslims are the only nation which is
replete with splendid deeds and marvelous performance. And, above
all, it has such tested and trusted knowledge and information about
the deeds of its elders and heroes which are irrefutable and beyond all
doubts. The Muslims need not be introduced to the Iliad and the
Odyssey of Homer, nor they are in need of Mahabharat and Ramayan,
for they, in their real history, have all kinds of more splendid and
amazing models than those of Iliad and the Odyssey, and Mahabharat
and Ramayan contain.
The Muslims have also nothing to do with the Shahnamah of Firdausi
and tales of the Spartans; for every page of their history can present many
Rustams and the Spartans. The Muslims need not hear the stories of
Nushirwan the Just and Hatim Tai; for in their true and authentic history,
countless Hatim and Nushirwan appear radiating light and luster. The

Foreword

25

Muslims also require no Aristotle or Bacon, Ptolemy or Newton; for in
the assembly of their ancestors, such philosophers and astronomers are
present which is a matter of pride for them.
How pitiable and amazing it is that, at a time, when there is tough
competition among the nations of the world to excel one another, the
Muslims, despite having the most glorious history, appear to be
detached and careless as regards their history. The class which may be
said to be more wakeful and vigilant among the Muslims, als~ quotes
in its lectures, speeches, writings, articles, magazines, newspapers and
books any eminent person from Europe or Christian world wherever
it needs to cite example of high morals or amazing performance, since
it is unaware of such personalities among the Muslims.
Who can deny this fact that the educated class among the Muslims
quote in their speeches and writings names of Hannibal, Shakespeare,
Bacon, Newton etc., more frequently than those of Khalid bin Walid,
Salahuddin Ayubi, Hassan bin Thabit, Firdausi, Tusi, lbn Rushd
(Averroes) and Bu Ali Sina (Avicenna). The sole reason behind this is
that the Muslims are unaware of and careless about their history. And
they are so, firstly, because they are much less fond of knowledge in
comparison to other nations; secondly, they have least opportunity
and leisure for acquiring knowledge; thirdly, Government schools
and colleges have almost wiped out Islamic educational institutions in
India; fourthly, the class which is generally called the educated class
among the Muslims and which is considered to be forerunner of the
Indian Muslims, comes out totally from the Government schools and
colleges where Islamic history does not form part of the syllabus or if
it is there, it is something other than what is known as history of
Islam. After obtaining diploma from colleges, the age of acquiring
further education is almost passed and one cannot have time left at
his disposal for studying Islamic Sciences. In all cases, our Muslim
educated class has to depend on the Islamic histories written in
English in a distorted form by the rivals and opponents of the
Muslims.
Before Islam, no nation of any country would turn towards the art of
writing history or compile any authentic history of its elders and
ancestors. In order to know how much progress in· the art of history

26

The History of Islam

writing could have been made before Islam, the scriptures of the Bible
and Mahabharat and Ramayan are enough to establish and believe it.
The caution, determination and courage the Muslims showed in the
preservation and narration of Ahadith has no parallel in the inhabited
quarter of earth.
The principle of Hadith and Asma'-ur-Rijal (braRch of knowledge
judging merits or other~ise of the narrators of Hadith) etc., came to be
invented as Sciences by the Muslims for the sake of the service and
safeguards of the Ahadith of the Prophet ~' against all -odds. The
strong, firm and unshakable principles invented by the Muslims for
research and minute study are so matchless that the like of which the
world never witnessed in its long years.
The first memorable work of the Muslims in connection with the art of
writing history is the arrangement and compilation of the Science of
Hadith. And in this connection and in the same manner, they penned
the accounts of their caliphs, nobles, kings, scholars, philosophers etc.
This whole treasure should be taken as Islamic history. The art of
writing history by the Muslims was a new and novel thing and an
unexpected blessings and essential asset for the world. When other
nations consider their books like Bible and Mahabharat as an asset
and a matter of pride, a man is left wonder-struck that the Muslims
take out and keep aside even Khatib's history from the shelves of
authentic books of history.
European historians, these days, appear to be engaged in hairsplitting
and the Muslims seem to be awe-stricken with and all-praise for their
perfection in this art and they do it with all the sincerity at their
command. But, they are ignorant even of the fact that the Introduction
to History written by Muslim historian, lbn Khaldfm belonging to an
Arab family of Spain living in North Africa, made the entire Europe
and the whole world to understand such unique points about t_he art of
writing history that all the efforts of European historians can be safely
sacrificed on the historical sense and acumen of Ibn Khaldfm. But the
high ambition and height of fondness of the Muslims can be gauged
from the fact that even in the assembly of scholars of Islam, the
original history written by Ibn Khaldfm fails to attract their sense of
importance and glory, except the Introduction to History.

Foreword

The praiseworthy endeavors of thousands of Muslim historians from
Ibn Hisham, Ibn Al-Athir, Tabari, Mas'udi etc., to Ahmad bin Khawand
Shah and Zia Barni and up to Muhammad Qasim Faristha and Mulla
Badauni, which are still preserved in fat volumes - each one of them
is the portrait of the fascinating magnificence and grandeur of the past
Muslim era. And each book on" Islamic history needs deep study, and
lessons derived from it may be of great use to the readers. But, how
pitiable it is that not a single Muslim among a hundred appears to be
aware of his Islamic history and goes through history books written
by Muslims historians, although a large number of Muslims have the
ability to read and understand books of history written by Mill,
Carlyle, Eliot, Gibbon and others.
Since all the books of Islamic history have been written in the Arabic
and Persian languages and even one among a hundred Muslims in
India does not know Arabic or Persian to go through these books, it
becomes a bounden duty to write Islamic history in the Urdu
language. As now, I am presenting this book, other farsighted persons
have an opportunity to write Islamic histories in Urdu in the form
better than this humble effort.

The Nature of and Facts about Islamic History
Islamic history is a science or art of permanent nature which has in its
fold thousands of voluminous books written by highly experienced
and esteemed writers. The Muslim historians have generally penned
separately histories of a dynasty or country or any one nation or any
one ruler or a king or an event of tremendous importance and value.
Some of them have compiled biographies simply of scholars of Islam
or philosophers of Islam or saints of Islam and their number reaches
up to thousands. This magnificent treasure and collection may be
safely brought under the title of Islamic history or the art of Islamic
history. And this treasure is multiplying with the passage of time.
The number of Islamic countries and kingdoms is also so large that
even a book of history of each one of them, if selected, can not be put
in a few shelves but in several rooms of a library. To produce an average
book of history in the Urdu language is, in fact, to extract essence of
books of Islamic history and to summarize the whole thing. It is easier to

28

The History of Islam

take a photograph of a very big scenery on a card or to put the
photograph of a palatial building into the hole of a bead of rosary, but
it is very difficult to produce a gist of the whole history of Islam in a
volume containing merely two thousand pages. Hence, I myself
cannot convincingly say that I have achieved success in my attempt. I
leave it to my readers to decide what place does this book occupy as a
book of Islamic history and how could the Muslim Ummah (nation) be
benefited by it.
As for the events and occurrences, for each and every event, I have
tried my level best to judge its veracity in the authentic histories of the
period when the event occurred. I have then tried to put the gist of the
events in my own words. Wherever any sharp difference of opinion
arose among the different historians and I found it difficult to decide
about the authenticity thereof, I have translated the opinion of the
historian exactly, and also expressed my personal opinion where the
situation demanded it. I have written this book as a service to Islam
and as a matter of religious duty and expect my recompense only
from Allah the Almighty.
I admit my incapability to undertake such a gigantic task and if I,
anyhow, come out with success, it is nothing short of wonders. And
anyone who takes the course of constructive and sincere criticism
exclusively for the sake of reforms, will be welcomed as a benefactor,
while the one who does it out of jealousy and malice is to be
consigned to Allah.

Introduction

History
Technically speaking, History is a science which deals with the events
and occurrences attached to Prophets, kings, conquerors and eminent
personalities and significant events of the ages past. These events give
us to know about the way of living, moral values and social learning
in the past. Some people have defined History in a manner that
humans living together form society and that collection of men gives
birth to city, and all the states and conditions undergone by them put
together take the shape of historical events, while collecting such
events by the latter from the former and leaving them for the posterity
as a model for learning lesson and benefiting from, is called History.
Some others say that the Arabic word Tarikh (history) has been
constructed by reversing the last constituent of the word Takhir, and
Takhir means to relate the past with the future; for instance, it is to tell
that so-and-so religion or rule or battle occurred at such and such
period. Thus, it is the only source of knowing what happened in a certain
period. In short, much hairsplitting has been done in defining History.
But the sum and substance of all the definitions is the same what has
been described above. If the gist of the gist is meant, one can say: "The
states and conditions and information which are chronologically
arranged make History."

30

The History of Islam

Need of History
History produces in our heart and mind blessed fervor by acquainting
us with the living conditions of our elders and ancestors. Human
nature has a particular kind of thirst and desire which activates man
to travel through the countries, to stroll in gardens and roaming the
mountains and forests. This demand of human nature keeps children
restless to hear stories of cock-sparrow and hen-sparrow, and to the
young to hear tales of parrots and starlings.
And this is what urges to carry out the command of Qur'an: "So ask of
those who know if you know not." (16:43) and turns human mind to
go through historical books. And keeping this in view, the Creator of
natures has put some taste in heavenly Books. What a great nation
was Children of Israel that they had claimed: "We are the children of
Allah and His loved ones." (5:18) but the more they were getting
unaware of the states and conditions of their elders and ancestors, the
more they kept falling into the quagmire of disgrace. Consequently,
Allah the Almighty has addressed them repeatedly with the words
"O Children of Israel! Remember. .. " and reminded them of the
conditions of their elders.

Benefits of History
Study of history sends ambition high, draws toward virtues and
keeps away from vices. It develops wisdom and insight, sets
farsightedness to grow and creates sense of caution and vigilance. It
fills the heart with utmost joys by warding off sadness and gloom. Its
study produces in man power to stabilize the truth and falsify the
untruth and enhances power of decision. It creates patience and
firmness and keeps heart and mind studded with freshness and
growth.
In short, .knowledge of history is a preacher of thousand preachers
and the best source of- learning lessons. By studying history, a man
finds himself constantly in the company of Prophets, kings,
conquerors, friends of Allah, wise men, scholars and men of
consummate skill and learning, and benefits from the fountain of their

Introduction

31

knowledge, wisdom, excellence and virtues. And he can easily save
himself from the mistakes committed by great kings, viziers, military
commanders and philosophers. No other study can fill human hearts
with so much joys without putting any mental pressure or causing
boredom as a study of history can do.

Preservation of Martial Characters through History:
The nation, fully aware of its historical background and events of the
past, can essentially and successfully preserve its national character
and distinction, and can restrain its people from getting demoralized
in any field of activity; it rather leads them to the lost pinnacle of
perfection.
An individual, who is uninformed of the background of his fathers,
may indulge in embezzlement. But one who knows that so-and-so
among his fathers achieved name and fame on such and such
occasion, keeps his honesty intact caring least for lacs of rupees. A
person who is uninformed of his fathers' past, may like to escape from
the battlefield. But one who is informed of some occasion when one of
his fathers took the field in an adverse situation and fought fearlessly
even at the cost of his life, will never flee the battlefield, and the very
background of his elder will serve as fetter for him.
Now imagine about the high morals like loyalty, truth, piety,
modesty, generosity etc. The way the elders and ancestors lived, can
produce the spirit of living in the nations and peace in the world.
And, perhaps, because of this reason that our neighboring states who
have no glorious history of their own, get their purpose served by
changing fictitious tales and false stories into historical accounts
thinking least about their disgraceful position in the court of the
historians.

History and Family Virtues:
Since history contains virtues of the good and evils of the evildoers,
an individual belonging to a mean or low family can give only scant
attention to true historical accounts. Noble nations preserve the great
and unique deeds of their ancestors in their memory which they

32

The History of Islam

follow to keep their nobility intact. Ignoble nations forget even some
of the good deeds of their ancestors with the passage of time. To a
family or nation whose ancestors have achieved a place of distinction
in the sphere of Divine worship, bravery, art and learning, power and
grandeur etc., and they have not totally ignored it, they could be
activated by producing in them sense of courage, determination,
shame and honor. But this device cannot be attempted in case of the
mean nations. This is the reason why most often men from the·
· respectable nations, of the honorable lineage, sons of saintly people
and the virtuous have especial interest in and fondness for the
knowledge of history. None among the atheists and well-known
coward had ever been a historian or a leader of the historians.

Historian
The best among the historians is one who is righteous in creed and
pure in religious affairs; what he writes should be true as a statement;
he is supposed to neither conceal anything nor add anything untrue
on his own behalf. Wherever there is chance of stumbling or being
victim of misunderstanding, it is permissible to explain and clarify it.
It is essential for a historian neither to indulge in sycophancy nor
harbor malice against anybody. The style of writing should be simple,
intelligible and spontaneous.
Orientation in words and style kills the very purpose of the
historiography. This is the reason why histories written in the form of
poems are considered below standard with respect to reliability and
authenticity. He must be noted for honesty and integrity; he has to be
distinguished in speaking truth and acting gracefully; he is to be miles
away from nonsense talking, hate and dejection.
The work of compiling, collecting and editing needs very hard labor
and determination from a historian, but still, he is not to be very sure
of the veracity of events, for sure access to facts behind an event is not
guaranteed. Besides having considerable knowledge of astronomy,
geology, civics and religions of the world, a historian must be
intelligent, discerning and fair-minded along with being a litterateur
and a man with perfect command on expression so that he could state
his motive easily and effectively. Despite all this, there are some

Introduction

33

difficulties which appear to be insoluble; for instance, a narrator
relates about someone going to a theatre. Now, such a narration gives
a number of reasons about his visit and nothing can be said to be
essentially true:
1. The person who went to the theatre is fond of songs.

2. He is not fond of hearing songs but is actually a lover of beauty.
3. He is not a lover of beauty but, all of a sudden, he has fallen in
love with an actress.
4. He is not a lover of anybody but he was essentially to meet a
friend there.
5. He wanted to write an article on theatre and hence he was bound
to go there.
6. He had to deliver a lecture against theatre and hence had to
observe it closely.
7. He is employed in secret service and his bounden duty led him
there.
8. He himself hated theatre but his friends forced him to go there.
9. He was a godly person and a pious man of high degree, but he
went to theatre to dissolve the devotion of the people to himself.
10. He had gone there with the sole purpose of picking pockets.
In short, one narrative can give birth to hundreds of deductions.
Moreover, any one healthy deduction needs support of many other
causes. Those supportive causes also have different possibilities. If the
historian is not just and he feels himself attracted to any
predetermined deduction, he very easily and carelessly overlooks
opposing pleas and collects favorable arguments by searching them
everywhere. Thus he seeks to mislead others by getting himself
misled.

Readers of History
As compiling or writing a book of history is an uphill task, to study
history and derive full benefits from it is equally difficult. Readers of
history should consider the study of the past events as source of
taking lesson and warning. They are required to save themselves from

34

The History of Islam

the mistakes and evildoings which the people of the past had
committed and paid for them, and try to practice virtue by being
acquainted with the best consequences of the virtues of the virtuous.
To decry or abuse anyone who has already departed from this world
is not an act of bravery. However, it is not a matter of shame to
express love for the dead and gone and to invoke blessings of Allah
for him.
To roam the countries, cities, mountains, forests, show places and
bazaars, and to study history books are very similar. The only
difference is that the experience a tourist collects through tourism and
travels of his whole life, the reader of history can collect more of it by
the study of history books for a day or a week. The more a reader of
history is victim of uncalled-for fanaticism, the more he will find his
study of history barren and unproductive for him.

Sources of History
The sources of history are generally divided in three types:
Solid Evidences: It refers to all written works like books, memoranda,
official papers, commands, decisions, documents etc.
Repeated Narratives: It means things that are talk of the town; for
instance, stories, poems, proverbs etc.
Archaeological Finds: It contains signs and relics, for instance, ruins
of the cities, forts, buildings, plaques of buildings, sculpture, ancient
weapons, coins, utensils etc.

But it is however, not easy to exploit all these three kinds of materials
to compile a book of history. These all appear to be meager without
intellectual power of high degree, labor, courage, urge and insight.
Besides national character, particular habits, rites and customs,
background and geographical conditions prove helpful to the
historian.

Types of History
From different respects history may adopt different forms.
Quantitatively speaking, it may be divided into two parts - general

Introduction

35

and particular. General history makes mention of the people of the
whole world; particular kind of history gi".'es knowledge about one
particular nation or country or dynastic rule. Qualitatively spealdng,
it is also of two kinds - narrative and critical.
Narrative history is one where the statement of the narrator is being
enlisted on the basis of his personal observation, and the acceptable
and satisfactory narratives have been available to the historian; or the
historian would have directly observed the occurrence of the event. Such
histories are useful most of all because they need not translating
conjectural and imaginary matters into real one. Such histories rather
bring about reforms in conceptual mistakes and rationalistic faults.
Critical history is one which is based totally on archaeological finds,
reported materials and rationalistic frauds, and any statement of the
contemporary historian or narrator regarding the event is not
available, like the recently compiled histories of ancient Egypt, Iraq,
and Iran. However, thes~ histories are also not without utility. But one
cannot be sure of real knowledge.

Hist~rical Ages
Some of the historians have divided history in three ages:
1) The Earlier Ages
2) The Middle Ages
3) The Modern Ages
The Earlier Ages contain.historical account from the beginning of the
world to the Roman rule. The Middle or Medieval Ages comprise the
period from the last of Roman rule to the conquest of Constantinople
(Istanbul) under Sultan Muhammad Usmani, the second.
From some great events are traced the periods of the occurrences of
some other events, for instance, such and such events occurred so
many years after the birth of Adam, or so many years before or after
the Deluge. Similarly, years are counted from the birth of Jesus Christ
or Vikarmajeet, or the emigration of Muhammad ;l@; from Makkah to
Al-Madinah or from the enthroning of a certain king. Currently,
Christian or Hijrah Era is in vogue most of

all.

The History of Islam

Islamic History
Among all the nations and religions of the world, from the beginning
to the end, Islam alone is such a religion and Muslims alone are a
nation which have their history wholly and solely preserved and
intact, and no part thereof has ever been doubtful. The Muslims have
never from the days of the Prophet ;ji!, up to the present day, acted
with negligence and carelessness in reducing states and events to
writing and preserving them for days to come. The Muslims are,
therefore, privileged to take pride in the fact that they can at any time,
compile the whole history of Islam with the help of contemporary
historians and eyewitnesses. Moreover, they can very safely show the
similar statements about events with unbroken chain of different
authoritative narrators.

In short, the Muslims are the only nation which has a complete,
exhaustive and authentic history of its own, and no nation of the
world can share this peculiarity and distinct feature of this nation.
Historians of Islam have practiced as much caution as to take down
the event and its nature as it were, without their personal opinion
whatever so that the readers are influenced not the least with the
views of the historian. Thus, the readers are at liberty to make their
own decisions and form their own opinions in their own way, without
toeing the line of thinking adopted by the historian. The greatness and
glory of Islamic history exerts deeper impressions on heart when it is
noticed that any time or any part of Islamic history can be safely put
to the acid test of reasoning and it will pass off without any impurity,
flaw and defect.

History of Histories
Having seen the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh, pillars of Ad and Iram
in the desert of Najd, pyramids and mummified idols of Egypt etc., an
urge is aroused in man to know about the builders. They have
attempted to write about the Babylonian people and have collected
immense materials on account of their incomplete critical analysis.
However, the lives and works of the founders of pyramids can be
penned through the strange letters available.

Introduction

Zoroastrian scriptures, Dasatirah Safrang, Bible and the present
scriptures, Ramayan of Balmiki Mahabharat are such books which
may give some right or wrong information. Idioms, phrases,
proverbs, stone weapons, iron tools, ornaments of silver, gold and
copper etc., idols of stone, preserved dead bodies of Egypt, pillars of
Asoka, Caves of Ellora, idols of Samath and Sanchi, Throne of
Rustam, Wall of China etc., put together make interesting materials
which may shed light not only on the whole inhabited quarter of earth
as brightly as it is required, but however, they can bring to light some
of the areas here and there, howsoever dim the historical rays happen
to be. True or false stories of the Indians, old plaques of the Egyptians,
ancient traditions of Chinese, ruins of the Iranians, writings of the
Greek-particularly the book of Herodotus, Israelite traditions,
Arabic morals-these are all vital and elementary parts of history.

Beginning of History
Roman and Greek eras, particularly from the conquests of Alexander,
start that part of history which has presented before us the states and
conditions of most of the countries of the world that there is far less
chances of the chains being snapped in the middle. And it is from here
that history is generally considered to take a start. As the study of
histories of Greece, Egypt and Iran fills its readers with joys, they are
equally enraged against the Indians, for even in that historical age,
India seems to be engulfed in darkness. This utter carelessness of the
people living here has always made the historians of the world to
shed tears of blood that they always cast fictitious stories in the mould
of truth and never allowed truth to take its course. As against the
green country India, there is another desert country Arabia, which is
contrary to India with respect to authenticity, power of memory,
preservation of table of genealogy and narration of events exactly as
they occurred. And, hence, even the historical assets of those religions
of the Age of Ignorance are reckoned as something valuable.

Real Beginning of History
Now, the Noble Qur'an is sent down. Arabia overcasts the entire world .
All the societies appear to be (according to the Qur'an) " ... scattered

The History of Islam

38

floating particles of dust." (25:23) before Arab society. History, in fact,
starts from here. Apart from magnificent task of arranging and
compiling Ahadith and Asma'-ur-Rijal, thousands of Muslim historians
are there who have worked such wonders in this field that one is
filled with amazement. There is no branch of society or human living
which has been left unnoticed or untouched by the Muslims.
Authenticity of narration is the life and running spirit behind all
historical activities. And the Muslims have taken this aspect into
consideration in such magnitude that none except the Muslims as a
nation may be cited as an example. The Muslims have devoted their
supreme abilities in compiling histories even of other nations and
countries. It is the Muslim nation alone which has taken the art of
writing history to the level of a science, and the name of Ibn Khaldun,
the originator of the principles of history, will keep receiving laurels
till the end of this world. From the time the Muslims have been
overcast by clouds of decline and ill-luck as a nation, and lost much of
their promptitude in their endeavors in this field, their pupils, i.e., the
European historians have picked up from there to some extent.

History of Sultanate
The distinctive feature of man as against other animals is that while
the animals have been kept within limits and their required
provisions are within their reach without endeavor, humans have
been given opportunity to get according to their efforts and struggle.
This object may also be described in the manner that man is
constantly in a state of travel and is being created to go from lower to
higher ranks. Among men one makes more travel or reaches greater
heights, looks upon others who are lower or lagging behind, but as he
is never to attain perfection, he being higher than others, is also
inferior to those above him. He by nature is endowed with the sense
of devotion and obedience as has been said:
"And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they
should worship Me (Alone)." (51:56)
Thus, the man who is ahead of others is forced by his very nature to
obey some power greater than and superior to him. This explains the
existence of kingdom and rule. A king or ruler is only lawfully

Introduction

39

perfect, and not in real terms, for real perfection is found in the one
who is absolute and not limited, immortal and not mortal, one and
not numerous.
And that One Self-Existent is Allah the Almighty Who is free from
every flaw, defect and evil and is the Possessor of all attributes in their
perfection. And thus, He is the real King, real Ruler and real Authority.
Since man is obeying by nature, hence, he is to obey and follow others
as a part of his very nature. And his real Ruler has prevented him
from doing so, as has been said:
"Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad ;i), and those
of you who are in authority." (4: 59)
Shadow law-enforcing authority or king may be only one who is more
perfect than others. Hence, it is the demand of human nature to keep
under sway whoever appears lesser in position, status and rank. But
since, man against his nature, has also the capability of moving
towards his downfall instead of rising up, it is the logical aspect of
mental attitude to develop a desire for something he doesn't deserve.
This is the reason why constant conflict is a common spectacle in the
world of rules and kingdoms. Enforcing authorities may be kept in
two different categories - spiritual and physical, or to say
Prophethood and Sultanate.
The skills required for materialistic rule have been stated in regard to
kingdom of Talut (Goliath) and Dawud (David) ~\ in these words:
"And their Prophet (Samuel) said to them: 'Indeed Allah has
appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you'." (2:247)
When the people heard of the kingship of Talut, they objected to it
and got the reply:
"Verily, Allah . has chosen him above you and has increased him
abundantly in knowledge and stature." (2:247)

It was further said about Dawud ~ I:
"... and Dawud killed Jalut, and Allah gave him the kingdom and
Al-Hikmah (Prophethood), and taught him of that which He
willed." (2:251)

40

The History of Islam

Now, from the study of histories, it comes to light that whoever got an
opportunity to become the center of the support of his people and got
superiority over others in respect of learning and physical power, he
was at once accepted as their ruler and sultan.
Three thousan_d years ago only physical power, wrestling and bravery
added by mental power were considered as essential assets for ruling
over others. But when human race gradually developed other
qualities, conditions and qualities for kingship were also added. In
short, the best and the most valuable person hcis always been a man to
rule. And mischief and trial, conflict and disruption, bloodshed and
plunder came to surface only when the undeserving got the throne.
And you will find no exception to this rule. Since every man is equal
with respect to his nature and rights, hence the acquired qualities and
skills alone could lead one to have power and throne, as the Qur'an
says:
"And that man can have nothing but what he does." (53:39)
Every head of the family who becomes the ruler or king is so because
of his fine qualities of head and heart. Every village·headman is the
ruler and king of his village. And this is the model of the rule or
government of early ages of humankind which is still existing and we
cannot pick holes in this system. Nevertheless, if any flaw or defect is
to be found out, it is solely on the basis that any undeserving and
incapable person in the family has captured power by foul means, or
if the headman of the village, or head of the locality happens to be an
undeserving person.

Personality and Democracy
Human face which is, on one hand, the noblest creation of Allah the
Almighty, and the served of the entire universe, has in his nature on
the other, to treat any exalted and powerful ~eing as the center and an
object of worship, and this demand of human nature leads him to the
concept of Oneness of God and to worship one God by rejecting all
other false gods. The greatest satanic cunningness and deception was
that man put heredity and lineage as precondition for getting throne
and forming government. It resulted in undeserving persons not

Introduction

41

capable of kingship to become kings and look down upon those who
really deserved it. This blunder of mankind gave birth to many evils,
corruption and disruption and the children of Adam had to bear the
brunt thereof.
The Noble Qur'an after being revealed and Muhammad~ after being
commissioned as Prophet, remedied the evil; and this embodiment of
the total human qualities, himself led the people of the state and thus
put before the world at large best example of the blend of Prophethood and temporal rule at a time. He explained to the human kind the
duties of a king and his realm of power. After him, his foremost
trained and benefited band, i.e., the noble Companions ~ elected the
best among them to rule over them in line with the teachings of the
Prophet ;i.
Thus, for the first time, broke the satanic spell that heredity could ever
play a role in making one a ruler. The choice of Umar Farooq • after
Abu Bakr Siddiq • was governed by the same principle. Although
Uthman Ghani • was also chosen without any consideration of
heredity and lineage, but some individuals and sections of the people
had some reservation about it, and Uthman Ghani • himself did
some favor to his relatives and the people of his own tribe. Hence, his
period was not without trials and tribulations.
Thus, it may be safely said that as the Prophet Muhammad ~
presented his example as a Messenger for 23 consecutive years to
redeem humanity, so also from I to 10 AH, i.e., for about 10 years, he
put before the world glaring example of righteous rule. And as the 23
years of the Prophet ~ are worth following for mankind, so the
Madnian life of the Prophet ~, the caliphate of Abu Bakr Siddiq and
the caliphate of Umar Farooq • put together and spreading over a
span of 23 years, are also worthy of being emulated.
At the end of the Righteous Caliphate, human weakness and satanic
swindling once again made hereditary relations necessary for
succeeding to the kingdom or rule. And the rule, instead of going to
the able and deserving, was unfortunately came to be considered as
the right of some particular dynasties. Thus, the unworthy sons of
worthy fathers appeared 'gracing' the thrones or seats of power. The

42

The History of Islam

people of those period had to undergo untold miseries and sufferings
to get rid of such evil and despotic rulers.
At last, their patience being exhausted, they took recourse to the
democracy practiced in France and America etc., today; although like
hereditary autocratic rules, democracies also cannot prove a source of
blessing for mankind. The only type of government corresponding to
human nature and a source of peace and blessing for mankind is one
whose model came to be seen in the first four centuries of the Hijrah
era. And that is, in fact, the system that lies between democracy and
autocracy.

Democratic Rule
In a democratic setup, a person is elected by the people for a period of
three or five years and he is called either the President of the republic
or the Head of the democratic government. But the President of the
republic does not enjoy the same powers which is required by an
affectionate ruler of mankind. Even in some ordinary matters the
President feels helpless and has to work against his will. It means the
government has no real center of power, and government affairs are
divided in a manner that they go .to belong to all the people of the
state.
When seen from a distance, this system of government looks pleasant.
And since, the people generally find themselves ruling over
themselves and feel that the chains of despotism or tyrannical rule are
broken, they are happy with the system, but ultimately they are put to
great loss as well.
Human sense of nobility lies against unbridled freedom. This is the
reason that in France and America etc., where democratic system is
working, the spiritualism desired by the religion is going to the dogs.
High morals taught by religion cannot grow and flourish in a country
where the flood of democracy is surging. Democratic system of
government seeks to put man on a path of such an unnatural freedom
that he can no longer retain his Divine values. Pure democratic system
is, in fact, a very strong movement of atheism and secularism. As
nothing grows in a desert, fish can't live out of water, and man cannot

Introduction

43

keep healthy in a dark place and polluted air, in the same way,
religious thoughts, restraints and prayers cannot stay and grow in a
democratic system of government.
The fundamental principle of religion is restraint and obedience. And
one's following of a true religion keeps intact the true feeling of
human nature that every high and respectable being is to be given a
high place and shown respects, and since, Allah the Almighty is the
Highest of all, one should bow down before Him saying Subhana
Rabbiyal-A 'la (Glorified be the Lord, the Most High). Every Messenger,
every Prophet and every guide in the world has rightly demanded
that all men should obey him and carry out his command. And none
can deny that human race has always achieved success simply by
following and obeying those Messengers, Prophets, guides and
leaders.

It is a fact that human race has reached the stage of progress and
development from the lowest level of disgrace and depravity. Thus,
the system of government which is injurious to the righteous course
and sets humanity free from all decent and reasonable restraints, can
never prove healthy and beneficial to mankind. Every father wants
his son to obey him and it also behooves the son to do so. Every
teacher wants his pupils to obey him and the same is demanded of
disciples, followers and soldiers, and they must respond to the call in
their own interest. But, under the effect of democracy every son,
pupil, disciple, follower and soldier looks upon obedience to his
father, teacher, saint, leader and commander as a matter of an
unpleasant duty to be performed against one's will. And, by and by,
all these things are so dissolved that man finds before him nothing
but atheism and secularism which ultimately lead to barbarism.
Democracy is basically against sense of religiosity, and hence the
more this sense is injured, the more there is chance for peace to go out
of sight. Real peace can be established on earth only through religion,
but governments have always eaten humble pie in this field. Inside
houses, in forests, deserts and pathways, a man is free from the
watchful eyes of the police. It is religion alone and not the
government which can hold one back from indulging in evil acts of
murder, theft, adultery etc. If all the inhabitants of the earth turn

44

The History of Islam

secular, it will become a hell for mankind by freely adopting the
course of killing and carnage, theft, adultery, lies, deception, mischief
and unmannerly behavior.
In the democracies of Europe and America, we find nothing which
could create a sense of envy in us. These are the countries where more
irreligiousness is found. In these very countries, human society is
more inclined to immodesty, and it is here that breach of promise,
disloyalty, self-centeredness, falsehood, deceit etc., have become
ingredients of their character. Democratic government can never give
birth to any Napoleon, Kaiser, William, Julius Caesar, Temur, Hannibal,
Salahuddin, Sulaiman Qanuni, Sher Shah, Alamgir. And, in case one
is born, he cannot remain alive, what to speak of the birth of Khalid
bin Walid.
It is, perhaps, the most ugly example of human depravity that we,
today, find even Muslims desiring of European and American type of
democracy, which is totally against the teachings of Islam and
something highly injurious to mankind. Such a shift in Muslim
thought is the result of the timidity and lack of courage, and it is
reduced to such a state because of ignorance and ignoring the
teachings of the Qur'an and Hadith .

Autocratic Hereditary Rule
When a person ascends the throne, his blood relation and natural love
demand that his son being inheritor of his property and possessions,
should also be his successor as a king. But this is his sheer mistake, for
kingship is not his property but a trust entrusted to him by his
country and nation. Hence he is not within his rights to put his rule to
his disposal and pass it on to anybody at will.
A trust is always consigned to its real master. Hence, it is up to the
nation to hand it over to any tested and trusted person most suitable
to the job. But it requires utmost courage and very strong resolution
to hold the king back from committing breach of trust and confidence.
Such dauntless courage can be produced by Islam alone which it has
done through the ages and what the Prophet~ had implanted into
his Companions.

Introduction

45

The Muslims evaded teachings of Islam with the result they lost much
of their courage, determination and ambition which Islam had
produced in them in the past, and hence, they could not put a check
on their rulers. Instead they shut their eyes to the misappropriations
of their rulers in every department of life. At last, the ugly practice of
forming autocratic hereditary rule which was obliterated during the
Righteous Caliphate, was once again brought back to life, and the
Muslims as a whole, had to bear the brunt of their agreeing to wrong
practice.
Hereditary crown princeship's unreasonable and praise-less practice
so often paved the way for most of the unworthy and incapable
persons to become rulers of the Muslims - persons who were even
lacking in the qualities of getting a seat in the assembly of worthy and
civilized men. Certainly there should be only one ruler or caliph or
king of the Muslims, but he must be the best among them and they
elect him with general agreement or majority opinion. Anybody's
birth in the house of a caliph or king doesn't mean that he has
necessary abilities to make a worthy ruler.
Had this practice of hereditary rule not been permitted, and the
Islamic concept of governance and the ruling system had been as
well-guarded as it was during the Righteous Caliphate, the Islamic
rule and the Muslims would not have reduced to such a sad plight we
see today. But it was the Will of Allah and hence it came to pass. Had
the Muslims opposed it right from the beginning and not slackened
their efforts to keep it intact, then although they had to give supreme
sacrifices at the outset, but later, none would have mustered courage
enough to get his son elected to the throne or declared him his
successor. Abu Bakr ~ had more than one worthy son to make a
good ruler but he found Umar ~ best among the Muslims and
recommended his name for the next caliph. Abdullah~ the son of
Umar ~ was, undoubtedly, worthy of being the caliph after his
father, but since, Omar Farooq ~ was essentially bent upon
uprooting this evil practice, issued command that Abdullah bin Umar
~ should, in no case, be elected caliph.
The greatest folly and blindness of people is that they see with their
naked eyes the evils of autocratic rule but still never take the trouble

46

The History of Islam

of going deep into the causes of these evils. By opposing autocracy,
they start praising democracy. The main cause behind the evils of
autocratic rule is that it had made room for heredity and snatched
away from the people the right to elect the ruler of their own choice.
Thus, it is the demand of reason that first of all the origin of all evils,
i.e., the system of hereditary rule be debarred from making entry to
the sphere of human activity. They should make it a point not to
allow at any cost the son of a ruler to succeed if he is not worthy of
becoming one. And he should be elected with consensus or majority
opinion even if he deserves the throne or seat of power. What sort of
wisdom it is to commit another such mistake to avoid one. It is the
timidity and. lack of courage on the part of the public that encourage
the despotic and unworthy rulers to go unbridled. The obedience
shown with a sense of duty is far apart from one which is done out of
cowardice. To make it more clear, we can cite the example of Umar ~
whose governors would say that they felt Umar's one hand below and
another about the jaws and he would tear our jaws apart on slight
deviation from the prescribed course. Khalid bin Walid ~ receives
the order of Umar Farooq ~ and he very silently obeys it in spite of
being a commander of great victories. Umar ~ is on the other hand,
challenged right on his pulpit and a very common and ordinary
person examines his honesty and trusteeship. A woman listens to
Umar's speech regarding bridal-money and has the courage to raise
objection against a point therein, and the Commander of the Faithful
had to admit from his pulpit that even the women of Al-Madinah
could inform him of his mistake.
Now, one can easily think of the sort of obedience shown to Umar ~,
and compare it with the kind of obedience shown.to the last Mogul
kings in the courts and in the very country they ruled. Royal orders
were not carried out not only in the Punjab, Sindh, Deccan, Bengal
and other provinces, but _also in Agra, Allahabad and Delhi.

Autocratic Democratic Rule
The type of rule Islam has formed on this earth is known as
Autocratic .Democratic Rule. The system of rule suggested by Islam
lies between pure democracy and pure autocracy. Every Islamic

Introduction

47

section has its say in the election of caliphate, king or ruler. In the
election of the most suitable and most deserving person for the rule or
caliphate, all possible fair means should be made use of, and the best
person to be elected at all costs. The Muslims need no institution of
law or constitution or formation of any modern system of
government, for they possess the noble Qur'an and the Sunnah of the
Prophet~.
Thus the task of electing best man for the job is also not difficult for
the Muslims. The man who knows the Qur'an and Hadith more and
acts more upon them is the most deserving of all to become the ruler
of the Muslims. To run the administration according to the teachings
of the Qur'an and Hadith and to enforce Divine and Prophetic
commands, are the main duties of a Muslim ruler.
The Muslims have every right to challenge their rulers if and when he
makes even slight deviation from the path set by Allah and His
Messenger ~- But it is incumbent on each and every Muslim to follow
every order of the ruler, if it is not contrary to the dictates of the
Qur'an and the Sunnah without even thinking to revolt against the
ruler. In case a Muslim ruler shows sign of deviation from the right
path, he may be deposed then and there. But if he carries out his
duties to his nation with Divine sense and good intentions, his
deposition would be the height of idiocy after passing a tenure of
three or five years.
The caliph of the Muslims happens to be the servant, watchman,
guard and trustee of the Muslims; why should then we remove him
from a position wherefrom he is serving the Muslims with all the
power at his command just for plunging in the trouble of a new
experiment. The Muslims do not want their caliph to enact laws for
them nor allow him to pass a luxurious life at the cost of public
exchequer. The caliph of the Muslims, under a moderate and
reasonable system, collects wealth from the wealthy section in
reasonable proportion and spends it on the poor, the needy and the
orphan for their welfare. Since, a reasonable tax is collected from the
wealthy section to be given to the needy, there is no chance of any
conflict arising between the capitalists and the laborers which has,
now, taken the whole Europe in its grip.

48

The History of Islam

The caliph of the Muslims is the guard and watchman of the Muslims
as well as their teacher, guide, commander, servant and king. In
important matters and national affairs, for instance, if an enemy
country is to be invaded or peace is to be brought about with the
hostile power, or troops to be sent to help any people or for protecting
the Muslims, or keeping peace in the country, the caliph has to hold
consultations with the Muslims for the Qur'an had ordained him to
do so. But the purpose of consultation is not to force the Muslim ruler
to toe their line by holding back his own. The sole purpose of such
consultation is that the caliph should listen to favorable and
unfavorable opinions about the issue and then form his own opinion
in the light of wise counsels. The Qur'an says:
"... and consult them in the affairs. Then when you have taken
a decision, put your trust in Allah." (3:159)
The model of the system of government Islam wants to set up, as
mentioned above, may be seen in the era of the Righteous Caliphate.
After that, the system of rule changed into autocratic hereditary one.
However, the bright points of Islamic teachings and morality kept
glaring out the rules established by the Muslims, and taken as a
whole, the type of rule set up by the Muslims has no parallel in the
annals of history. Democratic governments whose example Europe
and America are presenting today, can never come at par with the
type of rule Islam wants to establish.

Our Starting Point
Muslim historians have generally started their books from Adam ~
while others have done it from the creation of the earth and the
heaven. But I shall begin my history of Islam from the last Prophet ;I
of Allah, for states of things before him were not beyond doubt, and
there was also no particular arrangement of writing history in the
world before the Prophet ~- Moreover, it is from him that the
beginning of Islamic history is thought of, because it is commonly
called that he was the founder of Islam and the people of his Ummah
alone are called the followers of Islam, otherwise Islam has made its
presence on earth right from Adam ~, the father of man.

Introduction

Relation between History and Geography
Geography is very closely and strongly related to history and hence
the histories recently written in conformity with the European
historians contain geography. Even the biographers of the Prophet ~
have also included the geography of Arabia to illustrate some points.
But since I mean a complete but a brief history of the Muslims,
inclusion of geography means writing the geography of the whole
world, for the Muslims and their rule belong to the world at large. But
this is most difficult if brevity is to be kept in "iew.
Moreover, I have taken advantage of the good opinion about the
Muslims that they must be knowing the geography of the entire
world along with the maps of the countries. However, it is a part of
my plan to include in the book the maps of countries and states
wherever they are needed. However, this book will not contain
accounts of the Age of Ignorance, Arab nations, the Quraish, practices
of Ignorance etc., in great detail.
In case of the life history of the Prophet ~, I have largely benefited
from Sihah Sittah (the six famous collections of the Prophet's traditions
made by Imam Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Nasa'i and lbn
Majah) and preferred Ahadith books to the books of history. I have
taken out common materials from the history books Tarikh Tabari,
Tarikh Al-Kami/ of lbn Athir, Tarikh Mas'udi, Tarikh Abu I-Fida', Tarik/1
lbn Kha/dun, Tarikh Al-Khulafa' of Suyuti etc., and recorded them in my
book. And thus the brief account of the whole history has been
recorded in the best possible manner.
I have also taken accounts from the books of contemporary historians
about Islamic rules established in various cmintries after the decline
and downfall of the Abbasid caliphate. I have also quoted here and
there passages from Christian historians, but I have quoted these
passages just for the sake of getting support and using them as
witnesses. I have firm conviction that compared to the Muslim
historians, Christians are far less in true historical qualities. Hence, we
should never tum towards them for getting facts.

The Country of Arabia

A little mention of Arabia is essenti,11 ,1t the outset for the Prophet
Muhammad ~ was born in the city of M,1kkah and emigrated to
another famous city Al-Madinah, which also became the first Islamic
capital of the first Islamic State. Arabian Peninsula is the area which
converted to Islam completely during the Lifetime of the Prophet ~This country of Arabia was the first center of the grandeur of Islam. It
was in this country and in its language that Revelation was sent and
the last heavenly Book was revealed, which is the source of guidance
to all the countries and nations of the world till the Day of Judgement.
It is from this country of Arabia that the light of Islam spread to
everywhere in the world. In the city of Makkah lies the Ancient
House, the Ka'bah, towards which Muslims come from all over the
world and appear together on the plain of Arafat worshipping and
praying to Allah, praising and glorifying His Name. We find here the
wealthy and the poor side by side chanting praises of the Creator of
the earth and sky. Arabia dominated the entire world and became for
it the torchbearer and lamp of guidance.

The History of Islam

Situation and Physical Features
On the map of Asia there can be seen a big rectangular peninsula.
This is called the Arabian Peninsula or Arabia, which has the
following four boundaries:
The Arabian Peninsula is bounded on the east by the Arabian Gulf
and that of Oman; on the south by Arabian Sea or Indian Ocean; on
the west by the Red Sea; on the north by Jordan and Iraq.
The total area of the Arabian Peninsula is 1,250,000 square miles of
which 450,000 square miles is pure desert and forms part of a
completely desolate area. The most famous desert is known as ArRub' Al°Khali (the Empty Quarter) which stretches over an area of
250,000 square miles and extends to the southeast from middle of the
Arabia. On the north of this vast desert is Al-Ahsa or Bahrain, and
Oman lies on the south and east of Ar-Rub' Al-Khali. In the Arabian
Gulf, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Muscat are most famous cities. On the
south of Ar-Rub' Al-Khali, we find Hadramout and Mahra, which are
situated on the coast of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. To the
south and west of Ar-Rub ' AI-Khdli, is San'a' which is the famous city
of Yemen, situated on. the coast of the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea. At
the time of the advent of Islam it was the center for Christians in
Arabia. To the west of Ar-Rub' Al-Khali, lie Asir and Najran, which are
on the coast of the Red Sea. To the north of Asir, the Red Sea touches a
small territory called Tihamah, which is considered as a part of Hijaz.
On the north of Ar-Rub ' AI-Khiili is Najd in the shape of a square, on
the east of which is Bahrain, to the west is Hijaz and on the north is
the desert of Iraq and Syria . The name of the northeastern part of Najd
is Yamamah. Hijaz is situated at the west of Najd and east of the Red
Sea, it includes the cities of Makkah and Al-Madinah and the harbors
of Jeddah and Yanbu. Between Syria and the Hijaz lies a territory
called Khaibar and Hijr. It is another territory bound by Syria, Hijaz
and Najd. Inside Ar-Rub' Al-Khdli and between Hadramout and
Yamamah is a famous desolate area called Al-Ahqaf, which was once
the dwelling place of the people of Ad. A look at the above mentioned
places in the map will give an idea of Arabia and its famous
territories.

The Country of Arabia

53

CDmate and Inhabitants
In Arabia there is no river worth mentioning. Almost the entire
country comprises of burning desert and barren land and the areas
lying along the seacoast alone are in a flourishing state with
population. Scarcity of water has made human inhabitation almost
impossible in the middle areas. All the populated areas lie at the
seacoast except Najd, which is situated to the north of Ar-Rub' AlKhali and in the middle of the country. Najd is actually a plateau, it is
mostly desert and the desert range of Najd meets the vast deserts of
Syria.
Arabia is dotted with mountains here and there but no mountain is
fresh and green. Yemen and Hijaz, situated on the coast of Red Sea,
are fresher and greener than the rest of the area . The entire Arabian
population is 12.5 million meaning ten people per square mile. [The
figures relate to the past, at the time when the book was written.] The
sun is very hot there, and sunstroke is so sharp and violent that it is
generally considered poisonous. Even the camel, which is purely a
desert animal, falls down dead with a stroke of this poisonous and
burning wind. The camel is very useful in this country. For hundreds
of miles one cannot find a trace of water. The camel is a desert ship.
Long journeys are made on its back. Nothing significant grows except
dates, and the population generally lives on camel's milk and dates,
fish is eaten on the coastal areas. A greater part of the population of
this country lives a nomadic life so there are few big flourishing cities.
[After the establishment of a single union territory by King AbdulAziz bin AI Saud, and by the current development in Arabian
Peninsula, the above mentioned status has been changed.]
The scope of this book doesn't permit more space for writing about
the geography of the Arabian Peninsula.

Ancient Peoples of Arabia
Since very early times the progeny of Sam (Shem), the son of Nuh
(Noah) ~,, has inhabited Arabia. As regards designating eras, the
historians have put the inhabitants of Arabia into three categories

The History of Islam

54

namely, Arab Ba'idah, Arab Musta'ribah and Arab 'Aribah. Some of them
have held both 'A.ribah and Musta'ribah as the same and designated
them in two categories only Arab Ba'idah and Arab Baqiyah. Arab
Bii'idah refers to only those peoples who had inhabited Arabia from
the earliest age and they have all perished without leaving any trace
behind. Arab Baqiyah means those people who are still found in
Arabia. They also form two categories namely, 'A.ribah and
Musta'ribah. Other historians have designated the Arabs into four
categories - Arab Ba'idah or Arab 'Aribah, Arab Musta 'ribah, Arab
Tabi'ah, and Arab Musta'jimah.

Arab Ba'idah:
Some of the earliest tribes were called Ad, Thamud, Abil, Amaliqah,
Tasm, Jadais, Umaim, Jurhum, Hadramout, Hadur and Abd Dakhm
etc. These all were the progeny of Laudh bin Sam (Shem) bin Nuh
(Noah). They dominated the whole of the Arabian Peninsula and
some of their kings expanded their military conquests up to Egypt.
Books of history do not give any account about them and their
conditions. Ruins of their buildings, archaeological finds, some pillars
of stone, ornaments and sculpture have been found in Najd, Ahqaf
and Hadramout, which tell us that they were the strongest civilization
of their time with much grandeur and awe. Among these tribes, Ad
was the most renowned. These people lived in Ahqaf. Ad bin Aus bin
Iram bin Sam by whose name this tribe became famous, was the first
and foremost king of Arabia. He had three sons, named Shaddad,
Shadid and Iram. They ruled one after another.
About the same Shaddad bin Ad, Alla.mah Zamakhshari has written
that he built the city of Iram in the desert of Aden but it is now
traceless. The Noble Qur'an has also made mention of Iram but it
refers to the Iram tribe, not the city of Iram nor the garden of Iram.
The Iram tribe was perhaps, another name for the Ad tribe or perhaps
it was a branch of Ad tribe or the Ad tribe was itself a branch of the
lram tribe, Allah the Almighty says in the Qur'an:
"Did you not see how did your Lord treat the Ad of Iram who
were of so commanding stature that no creature of such a physical
strength was ever born in the cities (of the world)?" (89:6-8)

The Country of Arabia

55

Mas'udi has written that, before Ad, his father As was also a king. A
king named Jairun bin Sa'd bin Ad bin Aus of this very dynasty had
rampaged Syria and built a house of marble and precious stone, and
he had named it Iram. lbn Asakir has also mentioned the name of
Jairun in his history of Damascus. The Prophet Hud ~\ was sent to
the Ad tribe or the people who were raised from the same people. But
his people disobeyed him and were sent to their doom. The Glorious
Qur'an has detailed this event. Ad was followed by Abil, Amaliqah,
Thamud, and Abd Dakhm, who ruled the country one after another
until Ya'rub bin Qahtan brought about their end and set the
beginning of a new era. Prophet Saleh ~ \ was sent to the Thamud
tribe or the people of Thamud. Thamud lived in Hijr while Yamamah
was the place where Tasm and Jadais lived; Amaliqah lived in
Tihamah and Jurhum in Yemen. As mentioned above, all the tribes of
Arabia were the progeny of Sam, the son of Nuh (Noah) ~\, which
are shown in the genealogical table.

Arab 1Aribah:
This category of Arabs is the progeny of Qahtan. Prior to Qahtan from
Nuh ~I none of these ancestors had Arabic as their language. The
progeny of Qahtan used Arabic for the first time, which they
amalgamated from the Arab Bd'idah. The Qahtan tribes are divided in
two types, Yemeniah and Sabaiyah.
Scholars are widely divided over the genealogical issue of Qahtan.
Some of them say that he was the son of Aber bin Shalikh (Shelah) bin
Arfakhshand bin Sam bin Nfih, and the brother of Qane and Yaqtan.
Torah doesn't mention it, but Qane and Yaqtan are mentioned therein.
According to others, Yaqtan is derived from Qahtan, in other words,
what has been called Yaqtan is actually Qahtan. lbn Hisham says that
Ya'rub bin Qahtan is also called Yemen and the country of Yemen
was named after him. Now, if Qahtan belonged to the progeny of
Ismail (Ishmael) ~1, the whole of Arabia would be descending from
Ismail ~I for only two persons, Qahtan and Adnan are the remote
ancestors of all the tribes of Arabia. But the most confirmed and
acceptable understanding is that Qahtan and Yaqtan are the same
person and the Qahtan tribe does not precede Banu Ismail.

.Arab 'Aribah or Qahtan tribes have produced some famous kings who
had the whole of Arabia under their control. Ya'rub bin Qahtan did
away with all the races and traces of the Arab Ba'idah. A short
genealogical table of Banu Qahtan may be seen on the next page.
Yemen is supposed to be origin and the ancient land of the Qahtan
tribes. Among them, Himyari and Azdi tribes are most renowned.
Azdi tribes ruled over the city of Saba and southern Arabia. They paid
special attention to the progress and prosperity of the Yemenite
population. Queen Bilqis was from them and she was a contemporary
of Sulaiman (Solomon) ~I. The Tabi 'iyah kings 'who reigned over
Yemen and Hadramout also belonged to them. One of the tribes of
Azdi shifted to Al-Madinah, settled and ruled there. Khuza'ah turned
towards Makkah and defeated the Jurhum tribe who was then in
control of the affairs there. Nasr, the son of Azd settled in Tihamah;
and Imran, a son of Khuza'ah settled in Oman, and their children
came to be known as Azd Oman, while another one named Ghassan
settled in the frontier area of Syria and ruled over the frontier tribes.
In Yemen, the rule of Qahtani sultans extended up to 7 CE. Ghassan
bordered on the Roman Empire, while the Qahtani state of Hirah was
near the Persian Empire. At the time of the advent of Islam, the
Qahtan tribes were very strong and in a commanding position in the
whole of Arabia.

Arab Musta'ribah:
This category of the Arabs refers to Banu Adnan or the progeny of
Ismail (Ishmael) ~ \. They came to Arabia from the outside, therefore
they are called Arab Musta 'ribah or the mixed Arabs. Ibrahim's mother
tongue was ·'Aja mi or Persian. When Ibrahim (Abraham) ~ I left
Ismail (Ishmael) ~ I in Makkah along with his mother Hajira (Hagar),
they learned Arabic from the Qahtani tribe Jurhum, which was
already settled in Makkah, and later Arabic became the mother
tongue of the progeny of Ismail ~\. lsmail's mother passed away
when he was only 15 years old. After the demise of his mother, Ismail
~ I made up his mind to leave Makkah and to settle somewhere in
Syria. But the people of the Jurhum tribe in unison requested him to
change his mind.

He was then married to Amarah bint Saeed bin Usamah belonging to
Amaliqah family. After a short time, Ibrahim i¥\I came and Ismail
divorced his wife according to the instructions of his father, and then
married Syedah bint Mudad bin Amr of the Jurhum tribe. Following
these events, both Ibrahim ~I and Ismail ~1 started building the
Ka'bah on the old foundations made by Adam i¥\I. Ibrahim i¥\I
would lay the bricks while Ismail ~I would hand him the kneaded
clay and the stones while both of them were supplicating:
"Our Lord! Accept this from us. Verily, you are the All-Hearer,
the All-Knower." (2:127)
When the wall of the Ka'bah was raised to such an extent that the
work of construction was impeded, Ibrahim ~ I stood up on a piece
of stone to resume his work. This place is called the 'Station of
Ibrahim' . When the Ka'bah was near completion, Ibrahim i¥\I asked
Ismail ~ ' to bring a special stone to be put at the base as a cornerstone
so that place could be distinguished. Ismail ~ I led by Jibril ~ I
brought Hajar Aswad (the Black Stone) from Boqabis mountain and
Ibrahim ~\ put it in the selected spot. This is the same stone that is
kissed during the circumambulation (Tawaf) of the Ka'bah. After
rebuilding the Ka'bah, Ibrahim~\ and Ismail i¥\I took their followers
to Mina and Arafat, sacrificed their animals and circumambulated the
Ka'bah. Ibrahim~\ later departed to Syria and continued to visit the
Ka'bah every yea:, performing Hajj until the end of his life.
Ismail ~\ settled in Makkah for the rest of his life. The tribe Banu
Jurhum (Jurhum the second) had already settled in Makkah and the
Amaliqah tribe settled in the suburbs of Makkah. (This was not the
Amaliqah tribe of Arab Ba'idah.) Some people from these tribes
believed in Ismail ~ I while others kept to their old faith. Ismail died,
according to the Torah, at the age of 137 years. He was survived by
twelve sons whose descendants multiplied so much that the land of
Makkah could not contain them, and so they spread all over the Hijaz.
The trusteeship of Ka'bah and the leadership of Makkah remained
continuously with the descendants of I~mail ~I. Among his children
was Adnan, the son of Kedar. The progeny of Adnan includes all the
renowned tribes of Banu Ismail, and so the Arab Musta 'ribah of Banu
Ismail are called the people of Adnan.

The son of Adnan was called Ma' d and his grandson was called
Nizar. Nizar had four sons from whom all the Adnan tribes branched
out. As a result of this all the Adnan tribes are called Ma'di or Nizari.
The genealogical table of the Adnan tribes is given on the facing page.

Adnan Tribes:
Among the Adil.in tribes Iyyad, Rabi'ah and Mudar achieved fame.
To the well-known tribe of Mudar, belonged the Kinanah tribe which
had an eminent person named Fihr bin Malik who was also called
Quraish. The progeny of Quraish gave birth to many tribes, among
them Banu Sahm, Banu Makhzum, Banu Jumh, Banu Taim, Banu Adi,
Banu Abdud-Dar, Banu Zuhrah, and Banu Abd Mana£ gained much
fame. Abd Manaf had four sons namely Abd Shams, Naufal, AbdulMuttalib and Hashim. Among the children of Hashim was born
Muhammad ~ bin Abdullah bin Abdul-Muttalib bin Hashim who is
the last Prophet and to whom belongs the entire Muslim Ummah
(community). The aim of this book is to clarify the state and condition
of his Ummah (community) alone.
Abd Shams' son was Umayyah whose offspring are called Banu
Umayyah. When the Adnan tribes, defeated by Khuza'ah left
Makkah, they spread over different parts of Arabia. Banu Bakr settled
in Bahrain, Banu Hanifah in Yamamah, Banu Taghlib on the banks :·
Euphrates, Banu Tamim in Algiers, Banu Sulaim in the suburbs of AlMadinah, Banu Thaqif in Ta'if, Banu Asad in the west of Kufah and
Banu Kinanah in Tihamah. Only the Quraish tribes from among the
Adnan remained living in Makkah and its suburbs and they were in
disarray. Qusai bin Kilab (who was in 5th century Christian Era)
united them. By uniting various Quraish tribes, he brought not only
Makkah but also the entire Hijaz under his control. Thus, the
trusteeship of the House of Ka'bah once again came to the Adnan
tribe. Qusai did some repair work on the Ka'bah and constructed for
himself a big palace of which a spacious hall was set aside for the
people to assemble for consultations and serious discussions. It was
named Dar-un-Nadwah. It also served as the seat of power from
where Qusai performed official business. Qusai had also advanced a
proposal that during the Hajj days the pilgrims should be served food

62

The History of Islam

for three days and all the Quraish should make contributions for that.
In short, Qusai had achieved both religious and temporal power in
Makkah and the Hijaz. Qusai died in 480 CE and his son Abdud-Dar
became his successor.
After the death of Abdud-Dar, his grandsons and the sons of his
brother Abd Manaf fell out with one another. Mediation by the
influential people of Makkah brought the situation back to normal by
defining each group's responsibilities such as providing water,
collection of contributions and taxes, and acting as host to the
pilgrims. Abdud-Dar's grandsons were entrusted with the task of
military arrangements providing security for the Ka 'bah and looking
after Dar-un-Nadwah. After a short time Abd Mana.f's son Abd
Shams . handed over his right to rule to his younger brother Hashim.
Hashim was very popular among the Makkans for his trading ability,
wealth and generosity. He benefited the Quraish immensely, he
persuaded the Quraish to widen the scope of their trading activities,
which was very profitable for them.

How Abdul-Muttalib was named:
Hashim married the daughter of the chieftain of Al-Madinah (Yathrib
at that time). She gave birth to a son who was named Shaibah. While
the boy was still a child, Hashim died. His brother Muttalib became the
ruler of Makkah. Hashim's son, Shaibah was raised in Al-Madinah.
When Muttalib came to know that Hashim's son had grown up, he
himself went to Al-Madinah to bring his nephew back to Makkah.
When Muttalib came to Makkah along with his nephew Shaibah, the
Makkans mistook him as the slave of Muttalib. Although Muttalib tried
his level best to remove the misunderstanding, it proved an exercise in
futility and the name stayed with him and he was thereafter called
·Abdul-Muttalib. Abdul-Muttalib resembled his father in regard to
character, honor and renown. The power and influence of AbdulMuttalib aroused competition until it became unbearable for
Umayyah's son Harb. He challenged Abdul-Muttalib to combat. In
accordance with the practices of the time, a judge was appointed who
gave his judgment in favor of Abdul-Muttalib. This decision
aggravated enmity between Banu Umayyah and Banu Hashim .

The Country of Arabia

63

During the time of Abdul-Muttalib, an army from Abyssinia headed
by a chieftain called Abrahah, launched an attack on Makkah; but the
army, known as the people of the Fil (Elephant), was completely
destroyed by a natural calamity and heavenly intervention. The
genealogical relations of the Quraish tribes are given in the table on
the facing page.

Family of Abd Manaf:
Of all the tribes, Abd Manaf was considered, in the whole of Arabia,
as the most noble and respectable. After them their sons also excelled
all the nobles of Arabia. The real name of Abd Manaf was Mughirah,
who was also called Qamar and Syed. Since his brothers were named
Abdud-Dar and Abdul-Uzza, he came to be called Abd Manat and
finally Abd Manaf.

Moral Condition of Arabia
Arabia was, as mentioned in previous pages, the cradle of the Sam
(Shem, son of Noah ~ 1.) dynasty from the days old. Since very little is
known of the Arab Ba'idah, it cannot be definitely said what was the
moral condition of the Arab Ba' idah as compared to contemporary
nations of the world. However, it may be conjectured that in the
earlier times when human population was very sparse in the
inhabited quarter of the world, by and large, there would be many
similarities concerning their moral standing. Before the progress and
development made by Banu Ismail, and after the Arab Ba' idah, traces
are found of many realms and kingdoms from the time of the Qahtan
Arab's power throughout Arabia. But in no period of their history did
any one kingdom enjoy undivided power over the entirety of Arabia.
There were provinces with separate rulers, some of them more
renowned than others. However, inside the country, independent
homeless bands wandered aimlessly with their tents loaded on their
camels. Lack of pasture, water and the necessities of life always kept
the Arabs wandering and passing their days in hardship and
monotony. The lack of the necessities of life caused them to neglect
building a society. Their way of life showed no distinct mark or sign
of change and reform.

Life consisted of few activities and it had a uniformity of events that
gave them a great deal of leisure time. A large number of vast deserts,
the absence of production and indigenous things of value and the
dearth of populated lands and cities never interested any foreign
power to turn towards Arabia with expansionist ideas, nor were there
any means or reasons to attract tourists and traders to the peninsula.
Thus the people of Arabia were generally unaware of the progress
/
and development of other nations of the world and their society,
character and way of living. No foreign nation even exercised its
influence on the Arabs.

Assertions of Dignity
Under these circumstances and in such an environment only two
traits of character easily developed in the people of Arabia. One, the
development of the art of poetry for which they had a great deal of
leisure time at their disposal, passing nights in the open desert and
they were free of any disciplined stream of thought. Both of these
states served as great stimuli. Second, the tremendous effort to
survive and the subjection to a life of hardship made them extremely
fond of fighting and tests of strength. Constant mutual combat led
them naturally to self-praise and a growing discretion for exhibiting a
sense of dignity.
Pride and boasting, two typical qualities of man, led to bravery and
generosity defining distinct roles which they followed with great
interest. Idleness and deep indulgence in poetic composition turned
them to lovemaking and drinking. But bravery and boldness had
made them hospitable to a high degree and firm in fulfilling their
promise as a matter of honor. Gambling, archery, assemblies for the
recital of poetic verses, assertions of dignity, and competitions were
some of the means of passing their time. In short, Arabia and its
climate conditioned the Arab character.
Hud ~ \ and Saleh ~ \ and several other Prophets were sent to the
Arab Bd' idah. But the disrespect and disobedience shown to these

Prophets resulted in their utter and total destruction. Some Prophets
were also sent to another sections of the Arabs, the Qahtan Arabs, but
they paid very little attention to their call with the result that they met

66

The History of Islam

their doom time and again. Moreover, they could not profit
substantially from the teachings of their Prophets on account of their
rebellious attitude and undisciplined thinking. Some of the people of
Arabia believed in Ibrahim ~1 and Ismail ~1. In the sphere of faith
and religion, their genealogical pride and egotism and the
glorification of their ancestors led them to hero worship which
ultimately paved the way to carving idols in their names to be
worshipped. Idol worship led them to superstitions and many other
irrational ideas.
When the Qahtan tribes were on the decline and Banu Ismail (the
Adnan tribes) had gained ground, the invasion of Makkah by the
Khuza'ah tribe resulted in the defeat of the Jurhum tribe. The integrity
of the Adnan tribes was violated by this defeat and it injured the
power and dignity of the emerging Banu Ismail in the Hijaz. It
resulted in a fierce rivalry between the Adnan and Qahtan tribes,
which gave birth to small clans which were unable to transform
themselves into a united rule of significant importance.
The larger domains were not much better than anarchy, no Arabian
king and his system of rule over his subjects was as remarkable for
law and order as that of the ordiinary feudal system used in Persia.
This anarchy and unbridled freedom gave rise to untold immorality,
misbehavior and disrespectful rudeness which permeated the whole
social life of the Arabs and this human depravity continued until the
light of Islam rose from the dark horizon of this country.
Most of the Arabs were nomads, and very few had settled
permanently in townships and populated areas. The Arabs were very
fond of keeping an exact genealogy of their ancestors preserved by
memory. They would mention the names and deeds of their
forefathers with pride and thus animate zeal and the valor of their
people during fighting.
Perhaps it was the impact of the climatic conditions of the country or
their fondness for genealogy that caused the Arabs to have a very
strong memory. It was something simple for them to keep in memory
accurately odes of tribute that were several hundred verses long, after
hearing them only once. Their art of poetry and command of language

The Country of Arabia

67

led them to such a state of development that they named all the nonArabs as 'Ajam (literally: mute). If an individual of one clan was killed
by that of another, the clan belonging to the dead person would not
rest until they took revenge. To be at rest without an act of retaliation
was a matter of utter shame and disgrace for them. Reverence for the
Ka'bah and performing Hajj was a sign of power for all the Arabs
through all their generations. Helping the helpless and the oppressed
and keeping firm against the oppressors were qualities appreciated by
one and all. Timidity and miserliness were taken as the greatest
defects and the worst flaw of character.

Months of Peace
They fixed one or several months of the year when they considered
fighting as unlawful. During this span of peace and order all fighting
was suspended. And during those specific days they would visit the
Ka'bah and perform the Hajj. It was during these days that large
commercial fairs were held with poetic recitals and they offered great
opportunities for making new trading contacts. Some other traits of
the Arabs are also worthy of notice.

Faith and Religion
Before the appearance of Islam, the Arabs were passing through a
state where some of their tribes acknowledged neither the Creator nor
reward and punishment, while others were convinced of the existence
of the Creator but not of reward and punishment and the Day of
Judgment. Mostly they worshipped idols and stars; some of them
worshipped fire also.
They had transformed the Ka'bah into a center of idolatry and kept
360 idols inside the Ka'bah. Jews had also come from Syria to settle in
Al-Madinah (Yathrib at that time) and in its suburbs. They began to
arrive there from a short time after the death of Musa~\. Among
those Jews, Banu Quraizah, Banu Nadir, and Banu Qanuqa' were the
most renown. Some Christians also settled in the Ghassan and Najran
area and some people of Quza'ah tribe had also converted to
Christianity.

68

The History of Islam

Idolatry:
Idolatry was openly practiced all over Arabia. Four hundred years
in era of King Shapur of Persia,
before the advent of Muhammad
Amr bin Luhai bin Harithah bin Imra'-ul-Qais bin Tha'labah bin
Mazin bin Azd bin Kahlan bin Bablion bin Saba, the King of Hijaz was
the first to install the idol named Hubal at the top of the Ka'bah and
placed two idols Isaf and Nailah at the well of Zamzam and
persuaded the people to worship them. This Amr bin Luhai had
totally rejected the concept of the Day of Judgment.

*

Yaguth, Ya'uq, Nasr, Wadd and Suwa' were adopted by different
tribes for each of them had its separate idol. Wadd was carved in the
shape of man while Nailah and Suwa' were in the form of a woman.
Yaguth had the shape of a lion, Ya'uq of horse, and Nasr of vulture.
Some tribes shared idols, Tasm and Jadais had a common idol. The
Kalb tribe worshipped Wadd whose center was Dumat-ul-Jandal.
Banu Tamim adored Taim. Suwa' was worshipped by the Hudhail,
Mudhij and the Yemenite tribes worshipped Yaguth. Dhil-Kala'
worshipped Nasr at Himyar, the Hamdan worshipped Ya'uq, Banu
Mughith of Banu Thaqif tribe served as the guards of Lat at Ta'if, the
Quraish and Banu Kinanah worshipped Uzza while Banu Shaibah
were the caretakers of Uzza. Manat was adored by the Aus and
Khazraj tribes, Jehar by Banu Hawazin, Awai by the Bakr and
Taghlib, Muharraq by Banu Bakr bin Wail, Sa'd by Banu Malkan,
Sa'eer by Banu Antarah, Amyanas by Banu Khaulan, Raza by Banu
Tai, and Dhul-Kaffain by the Daus. Besides the idols mentioned,
many idols like Jarish, Shariq, A'im, Madan, Auf, and Manaf were
very famous and every one of them was the deity of one tribe or
another. Whenever any congregation of idolaters was organized, and
if an Arab was not able to attend it during the fixed days, he would fix
a stone called Duwwar and go around it like the Ka 'bah to compensate
for missing the congregation.
In Arabia, there were other centers of idolatry besides the Ka'bah.
Ghatfan had constructed a house similar to the Ka 'bah and called it
Qalis and they even performed Hajj there. Banu Khath'am had also
built a house calling it Dhul-Khalasah to perform Hnjj there. Dhul-

The Country of Arabia

69

Ka'bat was the center for worship of the Rabi'ah. There was a tribal
temple in Najran also which was built with three hundred skins and
was called the Ka'bah of Najran. The idolaters of Arabia would visit it
as they did with the Ka'bah. Moreover, they had also built a Haram
(sanctuary) around it where even a murderer or assassin was safe. On
the top of the Ka'bah there was another idol called Shams. Pictures of
Ibrahim, Ismail, Isa (Jesus) and Maryam (Mary) r')L..)1 ~ were also
worshipped in the Ka'bah.

Sacrifice:
The idolaters, when coming to perform Hajj, brought camels for
sacrificing and offering to their idols. They had a practice ti;, suspend
shoes from the necks of the camels and marked them to signify them as
sacrificial animals. Nobody would then get in the way of the animals.
Moreover, the calves of the camels and sheep and other animals were
sacrificed to the idols. Some of the tribes even sacrificed humans to the
idols. According to some historians, the idolaters of Arabia believed in
the Oneness of God and acknowledged Him as One. They worshipped
idols because they believed that they will intercede with Allah for
them. Some of the tribes entertained the belief that the person on whose
grave a she-camel was sacrificed, will on the Day of Judgment, rise
from his grave mounted on his she-camel. This belief indicates that
they believed in Day of Resurrection and some form of Judgment.

Star-Worshipping:
When the Arabs were still in ignorance, worshipping stars was very
common. Historians have no substantial proof if Arabia, Egypt,
Greece or Persia were the first to institute the worship of stars or if
they came to it separately. However, it is hard to imagine that
worshipping stars came to Arabia from outside. The sun was
worshipped by Himyar tribe, the moon by the Kinanah, Dahran by
Tamim, Jupiter by the Lakhm and Judharn, Suhail by the Tai, Shera by
the Qais and Mercury by the Asad. Most of the tribal idols were
named with the names of stars. Stone idols and noted stars were
worshipped commonly by different tribes. They often based their
important affairs on the rising and setting of certain stars.

70

The History of Islam

It is not surprising that the people passing their days and nights in
open fields and deserts had their attention focused on the stars and
planets and acknowledging some of them as their deities. From Surat
Nuh of the Qur'an it comes to light that even during the era of Nuh
:%!JI, Iraqi Arabs worshipped Yaguth, Ya'uq, Wadd, Nasr, and Suwa',
which are all named after stars. It makes it very clear that star
worship in Arabia was a very old affair. The moon was worshipped
more than any other object.

Soothsaying:
Soothsayers were found in large number in Arabia. A Kdhin was one
who claimed to have information about the unseen events of the past
while, those giving information of the future were called Arra[. Both
men and women claimed knowledge of the unseen. Among the
soothsayers of Arabia Af'a, Jadhimah, Abrash, Shaq and Satih were
well-known. Another kind of soothsayer was known as Nazir, they
could tell about the unseen by focusing their eyes on a mirror or on a
tray of water. They included casters of pebbles and the pits of fruit.
They all belonged to the same category but they were ranked below the
soothsayers, while those making amulets were considered the lowest.

Omens:
The Arabs also believed in good and bad omens. They held crows to
be very inauspicious and something that causes separation. Since the
crow is called Ghurab in Arabic, they called travelling as Ghurbat, and
the traveler as Gharib, as according to them, the influence of a crow
causes separation and causes man to suffer the hardships of
travelling. And owl was also very unlucky to them for its hooting
cries, they believed caused death and destruction. Sneezing also
carried an ill omen to them. Some of them were sorcerers and they
dealt in sorcery and performed heavy exercises to befriend Satan.

Fighting
Fighting would break out over petty matters and insignificant
incidents. Once hostilities began they could linger on for several
generations and even centuries. Most of their fighting started without

The Country of Arabia

71

any substantial reason. There were more than one hundred feuds
during the Days of Ignorance in Arabia that were famous, for
instance, Bu'ath, Kilab, Fatrat, Nakhklah, Qarn, Suban and Hatib were
the names of well-known feuds .
No tribe ever benefited from these feuds; they only suffered
destruction and the loss of life and property. They had an old practice
of putting to death the women and children of the defeated enemy
after taking them prisoner. However, if a person had eaten from their
food or had received hospitality from them previously, they were safe
from being killed. They would shave the heads of those whom they
released.
Most disputes would be settled by a challenge to single combat. They
took special care of their horses and weapons. The battle array of
armies was not in practice. Anyone achieving perfection in
swordmanship, archery, cavalry, or fighting with lances was held in
high esteem and his name and reputation would quickly spread far
and wide. Some particular tribes gained distinction in the use of some
particular weapon. They had special names for weapons, swords,
bows and horses, which were famous throughout the land. For
instance, the name of the sword of Harth bin Abu Shimr Ghassani
was Khudhum, while the sword of Abdul-Muttalib bin Hashim was
called Atshan and that of Malik bin Zubair was Dhun-Nun. These
evidences let us know that the people of Arabia had a great zest for
fighting and killing. This is the reason behind thousands of names
given to horses and swords in Arabic.

Illicit Sex
Arabs in the Age of Ignorance had no custom of observing Hijab
(covering of women) and their women would come freely before
strange men. The lack of the necessities of life and other timeconsuming affairs, an irresponsible sense of freedom, over indulgence
in poetic composition, their assertion of pride and superiority, and the
hot climate of the country was enough to instigate this tendency.
Anyone who never fell in love with a strange woman was disrespected.
Some tribes were renowned for their love making. Banu Adhrah' s
love gained so much celebrity and renown that it became proverbial:

The History of Islam

72

o;~ I.S'! ~ J-!,i
That is, so-and-so is a lover greater than Banu Adhrah. Someone
asked a bedouin which tribe did he belong to? He replied that he was
from a tribe that when they fall in love they pass away. A girl heard it
and remarked: "By the Lord of Ka'bah, you are from Banu Adhrah."

Poetry
During the Age of Ignorance in Arabia everyone participated in the
art of poetry. Men, women, children, old and young, all were poets of
higher or lower degree. They were born with poetry and eloquence.
Their poetic exercises generally were impromptu. They needed no
thinking or reflecting and never needed to search for topics. They were so
proud of their eloquence and command of language that they considered
all the non-Arabs as unable to speak. But the Qur'an shattered the
arrogance of their eloquence and rhetoric into pieces and they had to bow
down before the glory of the Book of Allah.
The one whose ode of tribute was acknowledged as the best in a poetic
congregation on the occasion of fairs, special functions and Hajj, was
immediately accepted as the best among them in position and stature. To
them poets were equal to brave commanders and kings or even greater
than them in status. In fact, it was an easy job for the poets to cause tribes
to fight against one another, to make tribes extraordinarily brave, to keep
the fighting going or to put an end to it. The best odes of tribute were
hung over the walls of the Ka'bah. Thus seven such odes of tribute
known as the Seven Golden Odes, which were written by Imra' -ul Qais
bin Hijr Kindi, Zuhair bin Abu Salma Muzani, Labid bin Rabi'ah, Amr
bin Kulthum and Antarah Absi.

Passion for Hunting
During the Age of Ignorance, the Arabs had a great enthusiasm for
hunting and so there are a great number ,of terms in Arabic for
hunting activities. The game which moves from right to left was
called Siineft, while the one going from left to right was called Bi1reh. The
game coming from the front was called Niiteh and the one from behind
was Qa'eed. The hunter's ambush was named Qarrah. Zabiah was the

The Country of Arabia

73

name given to the ditch dug for hunting a lion. They gave the name
Talabbud to the state of the hunter when he crawled on his stomach
sticking close to the earth, and the state of going out to hunt and coming
back without hunting was called Ikhfflq. On hunting an animal they ate its
meat without any sense of its being permitted or prohibited. Islam
brought about the limitation of lawful and unlawful and imposed certain
restrictions on hunting.

Food and Clothes
Arabia produces neither silk nor cotton. Some regions produce them
in such a meager quantity that is quite insufficient for the needs of the
people. Yemen has been noted for its cloth from ancient times. The
Arabs generally had very simple clothes to wear. Wearing coarse clothes
with leather patches was customary. Some people would make a
sheet by joining small leather patches held together by pins, and such
a sheet or mantle served the purpose of wrapping and spreading.
Garments were also woven from camel and sheep hair, and those
pieces of cloth were also used for making tents and for bedding and
carpeting. Loose low hanging colorless shirts, waist sheets and
turbans or scarves on the head were standard dress. They knew about
aloeswood, ambergris, and incense. Their food was also very simple
and unceremonious. They could be content with unpalatable food
with a bad taste. Meat and flesh happened to be very tasty and
valuable things to them. Milk and meat were most common. Cheese,
battered barley grain, dates, olive oil, and Harirah were their common
items. Sieving of flour was not a common practice; they rather baked
bread with unsieved flour. They had no proper etiquette of dining.
This can be assessed from the dos and don'ts prescribed by the
Prophet ~ I for eating and drinking in Ahadith which forbid many
kinds of misbehavior like gluttony, shamelessness, unclean habits and
nonsensical talk while eating.

Plunder
As mentioned previously, Arabia had two types of people, one settled
in cities and settlements and another living a nomadic life, the latter
were larger in number. Although the citizens carried some qualities

74

The History of Islam

like rights of neighbors, trusteeship and honesty, but the defects of
deceit, cheating and conniving in trade and business were
plentiful. They were expert in raiding and highway robbery of the
nomadic type Almost all were addicted to looting the travelers and
snatching away goods by force. On finding someone making a
journey alone, they covered and hid the wells which were on the
way with grass and other things so that the traveler would die of
thirst and they would take his goods. Some of them were
proverbially expert in committing theft. These thieves were called
Dhubiin-ul-Arab (wolves of Arabia).

Conceit
Conceit had touched its peak during Arabian Ignorance. Jadhimah
Abrash was so haughty that he never appointed ~ny one as an adviser
to consult with. He would say that Farqadain (the two brilliant stars
near the Polestar) were his companions. Many other tribes were well
known for these base qualities and none of the tribes were free from
this conceit. As a result of this, they never listened to the good counsel
and preaching of the Prophets and religious guides for obedience was
a trait shameful to them.

Unending Malice
In case they failed to take revenge on their enemy or assassin
during his lifetime, they made his sons and grandsons the target of
their revenge and they passed their days in discontentment until
they took out their vengeance on their enemies. They would take
revenge even if the reason behind it had been forgotten. They
would be intent to kill someone out of enmity without even telling
anyone what was the cause of the hostility.

Mourning the Dead
Upon the death of someone, his relatives would tear at their faces and
hair and cry in pain. Women would follow the funeral with their hair
untied and head dusted. Like the Hindus in India shaving their head and
beard out of sorrow for the dead, in Arabia during the Days of Ignorance,

The Country of Arabia

75

women would shave their heads. Women were also called for lamenting
which they did at the top of their voices; after the burial, these women
were served food.

Superstition and Credulity
They believed in the existence of jinns, demons and fairies. They also
believed that fairies could fall in love with human males, and jinn
could form physical contacts with human females. Although they
considered jinn as invisible creature, they believed that the union of
the material and immaterial could bear babies. The Arabs believed
that Jurhum was born as a result of union between a human and an
angel. This was their belief also about the Queen Bilqis of Saba (Queen
of Sheba) . About Umar bin Yarbu they thought that he was born with
the union of a human and a fairy .
The she-camel bearing five calves and the fifth being a male, was
called Bahirah and they left it free by piercing its ears. She was at
liberty to go and graze anywhere and nobody objected to it. In case
any sheep bore a male, it was offered to the idols; and if it happened
to be female, they kept it for themselves. In case of a male and female,
they held back from sacrificing them and called them Wasilah . The
male camel that had fathered ten calves was held in great honor. They
neither loaded it nor made it a mount and left it free like a bull. It was
called Ham .
They used to keep three arrows before the idols or at the threshold of
the temples. They wrote La (no) on one arrow and Na 'm (yes) on
another. The third would be blank. In case of any problem they would
take out one arrow from the quiver. If the arrow with La written on it
came out, they dropped the plan of doing what they wanted, and if
the arrow showing Na'm was picked, they thought themselves
permitted to do whatever they had planned. If the blank arrow came
out, they continued the exercise until the arrow with either La or Na'm
came out. While setting out on a journey they would tie a knot on a
thin branch of a certain type of tree called Ratm. On coming back they
would notice whether the knot was intact or untied. If they found the
knot untied, they believed that their wives must have committed
adultery while they were away. At the death of a person, his she-

The History of Islam

76

camel was fastened to his grave with her eyes closed until she died
there or the head of the she-camel was pulled towards her breast and
tied to it, and they would left her until she died. It was done in
accordance with the belief that the dead person, when raised from his
grave, would find the she-camel and have it as his mount. They
believed that if a person went to a settlement and was afraid of an
epidemic there, he would be saved if he cried loudly like an ass
standing at the gate of the settlement. When the number of camels in
one's possession would reach more than one thousand, he would take
out both the eyes of the bull among them to save all the other camels
from calamity. When a camel would develop mange, the healthy one,
instead of the sick, was branded with the belief that the sick one
would restore its health. The famous poet Nabighah says in his
couplet:
"You left the stranger and loaded his burden upon me, as they
leave the camel suffering from mange and brand the healthy
camel grazing peacefully instead."
Similarly, they would beat the ox if a cow refused to drink water.
They believed that the ox was possessed by a jinn who would stop the
cows from drinking water. They believed that if the killer of someone
went unpunished, a bird named Hamah would come out of the skull
of the dead person and would go on crying: "Give me water, give me
water," until the crime was avenged. They believed that some person
had a snake in his stomach and when it was hungry it would tear and
eat away the flesh from the ribs of the person. They had a belief that if
the children of a woman kept dying, they could be saved from dying
if the woman concerned trampled the dead body of a noble and
wealthy person with her feet. They also believed that the jinn feared
rabbits and so they suspended rabbit bones from the neck of their
children to keep them safe from the ill effect of the jinn.

Killing of Daughters
The custom of killing their daughters was rampant among the Banu
Tamim and the Quraish. They took pride in killing their daughters
and it was for them a status symbol. This heartlessness reached such a
height in some tribes that when the daughter became five or six years

The Country of Arabia

77

old and start uttering sweet words, the stone-hearted father would
take her in beautiful garments to a place outside his settlement where
he had already dug a deep ditch. He would then make his daughter
stand beside the ditch and then push her into the ditch stoning her to
death while she called for her father's help. No screaming and crying
could melt his heart and he would return after filling the ditch. They
took pride in burying their daughters alive. Qais bin Asim, a man
from Banu Tamim, buried his ten daughters alive in this manner.
Although no tribe of Arabia was free from this inhuman custom,
some tribes did it more than others.

Gambling
The Arabs were very fond of gambling too. They gambled with arrows
which had no feathers. They were ten in number, and their names in
order were: (1) Ghadh, (2)Tawam, (3) Raqib, (4) Nf:ifis, (5) Hals, (6) Mahal,
(7) Mualla, (8) Fasih, (9) Manih and (10) Waghd. Each of them had its
own share, for instance, Ghadh had one, Tawf:im had two, and Raqib
had three, and it kept increasing in this way till Mualla had seven
shares, while the last three arrows had no share. Ten wealthy persons
would buy fat goats and divide them into twenty-eight shares. The
arrows would be handed to a designated person who would take out
and give each person an arrow one by one, and each person got his
share according to his arrow 's share. They played such games of
chance before Hubal at the Ka 'bah. Another form of gambling was
that they collected some sand and hid something in it. Then after
dividing the sand into two heaps they asked the players to tell in
which heap was the hidden object. The one who guessed it correctly
was declared the winner and those guessing incorrectly were
declared as the losers.

Arabian Ignorance and Other Countries
What has been described in the previous sections refers to the
condition of Arabia and its people before the appearance of Islam and
the advent of the Prophet j/§;. What has been stated regarding
character, habits, living, religion, and beliefs reflects the conditions
from one century before the era of the last Prophet ~ and remained

78

The History of Islam

unchanged until he was declared a Prophet. The reader can ponder
over what kind of environment the Prophet~ was sent to and how
depraved were the people when Islam came to them. The following
pages will give a picture of the magnificent revolution brought about
by the teachings of the Prophet ~ and the impact of Islam as a force.
This assessment may be correctly made when we cast a glance at the
overall situation prevailing in the world and to see how Islam brought
about change in the existing situation. It is appropriate at this time
after assessing the situation in Arabia to take a look at what condition
the world contemporary to that time was experiencing.

Persia {Iran)
Persia was reckoned among the most renowned, ancient and
venerable civilizations. During the ancient times the people
worshipped the moon, and a large number of religious guides came
on the scene one after another to reform the situation. Before the end
of this period Zoroaster gave currency to the fire worship. [The
religion of Zoroaster was free from fire worship and proclaimed
oneness of God but fire worship took over this religion later on.] He
offered himself as a true guide and very soon it became the state
religion and that of its subjects.
The Persians, possibly surpassed all other countries in terms of
progress and development. During the height of its greatness and
glory, Persian rule had stretched from Egypt to Mongolia and from the
Himalayan range and Persian Gulf to the Altai Mountains. Persian
society ruled over the whole of the Asian continent and their culture,
civilization and ethical standards were considered worth following in
every Asian country. At the time of the appearance of Islam, they had
become so low and depraved that they had lost most of their good
qualities after falling into the dark quagmire of polytheism. They had
given Zoroaster divine attributes and enlisted him among their false
deities. The creators of good and evil were worshipped in the name of
Yazdan (Ahura Mazda-god of goodness) and Ahriman (Angra
Mainyu-god of evil and darkness). They worshipped fire and light
openly and fervently. The worship of the moon, the sun, the stars and
the planets was also in vogue. Theft and highway robbery were

The Country of Arabia

79

rampant. Adultery was so much in force that the wicked Mazdak asked
for a liaison with the Princess of Kisra (Chosroes) openly in the court
and the ruler of Persia did not think it necessary to oppose this most
unreasonable and immodest demand. Mutual dissension and bestiality,
malice and enmity, cheating and deceit, treating the weak by the strong
more disgracefully than even the animals were some of the defects that
had sent Persia to the lowest level of depravity and degradation. Persia
was bereft of all ethical and human qualities, and the country that was
once the center of culture and civilization was groping in the dark. Not
only that worship of stars, fire and heroes was their custom, the kings,
ministers, commanders and nobles also made the people worship them.
The Persian subject rose to freedom from this torment and the darkness
was dispelled only when the Muslims marched into the Persian
territories and brought it under their control.

Greece and Rome
Another great power and rival of Persia was the Roman Empire. Greek
and Roman civilizations were also very ancient and magnificent and their
arts and sciences and grandeur and glory had been universally known.
No country of the world could surpass Greece in the spheres of medicine,
mathematics, astronomy, logic, and philosophy. This country had
produced Socrates, Hippocrates, Luqman, Plato, and Aristotle. It was in
this country that a conqueror and king like Alexander was born. The
Roman Caesar whose capital was Constantinople, was not only an
emperor but considered also a religious guide. But, despite all these
material and scientific developments, both Greece and Rome had, during
the sixth and seventh centuries, become steeped in such degradation and
depravity that the darkness prevailing in Persia was in no way deeper
than in Greece and Rome. As every indebted person in Persia would sell
himself like a slave, Greece too had several kinds of slaves. One kind of
slave could not be sold outside Greece, but all other kinds of slaves were
sold in foreign lands like horses, oxen, camels, and goats. Any master had
the right to kill his slave as anybody has the right to slaughter his animal.
Parents would sell their children and make them slave of others. In
Greece and Rome, slaves had no right to marry and there was no legal
relation between the slaves and their children.

Depravity of the Christians
For the first two hundred years after the birth of Isa (Jesus)~\, there
was no trace of a monk among the Christians. But during the sixth
century, the number of monks rose to such an extent in Syria, Greece
and Rome that anybody desirous of being held in high esteem became
a monk. Gradually this custom prevailed among the womenfolk with
the result that monasteries became centers of all kinds of shameful
acts. Some monks lived in deserts.
Respect of women and parents had no place in their lives. Theft,
adultery and cheating were most common. Begging was not a matter of
shame which was in fact the logical result of being a monk. The
concept of the oneness of God and divine worship was virtually Jost.
Certificates of deliverance could be had from the monks and religious
guides by pleasing them through services. The rich considered it their
legal right to have the poor serve them. Kings and commanders
treated their subjects like animals and took control of the efforts of
their labor and left them very little to live on.

Egypt
To assess the ancient pos1t10n of Egypt and its social greatness, the
mammoth construction of the Sphinx, the Egyptian pyramids and
objects and articles recovered from the many excavations in recent times
have a lot to tell about the glory and grandeur of ancient Egyptian
society. Since Egypt is an agricultural country, it became the target of
successive foreign attacks when it had grown weak. Persians, Greeks
and Romans invaded it time and again and kept it under their control
for long periods. It is a matter of conjecture that the society and
civilization of the invaders favorably influenced the Egyptians.
Christianity was followed by a large section of the Egyptians during
the reign of Romans. But, before the advent of Islam in Egypt, it was a
country immersed in darkness and depravity. Christianity in Egypt
was in no better position than pure idolatry. All the defects that had
been part of Egyptian idolatry could be found among the Christians.
The Romans and the Greeks who were known as ruling nations

82

The History of Islam

treated their subjects more disgracefully than even their animals. The
defects found among the Greeks and the Romans took their worst
forms among the Egyptians. Slavery was rife in the most wretched
form. Alluring principles and rules were instituted for committing
adultery and pillage. Human killings served as a source of
entertainment. Women were encouraged to commit suicide. In short,
the darkness prevailing in Egypt was not less than that of anywhere
else. Egypt was replete with all the forms of degradation that could be
thought of.

India
Great Maharajahs like Asoka, Chandra Gupta and Vikarmajeet had
already passed away. Indians were particularly proud of their
astronomy, mathematics and philosophy. They also retained the tales
of founders of religions like Krishn, Ramchandra and Gautama, and
the epics of Mahabharata and Ramayana. But the era we are referring
to here is one when Buddhism was declining and making a way for
Brahmanism. No province of the country had a magnificent leader.
Idolatry was rampant in the entire country. Idol worship was considered
as the only means of deliverance both in Buddhism and Brahmanism.
In most cases, idols of Brahmans and Buddhas were kept side by side
in the same temple and were worshipped with great fervor.
A Chinese traveler writes that no household was free from idols. The
immodest and impure ways of Barn-Marga had achieved popularity
all over the country. They had also instituted, like the Egyptians, rules
and principles for committing adultery, which were essentially made
a part of their religious rites. The Rajahs of Sindh set the example of
marrying their own sisters. When Rajahs and rulers had reduced
themselves to such human degradation, it is not surprising that their
subjects followed them in meanness of character. Some books written
in that period that are now available as part of the Hindu scriptures
and religious books, bring to light the utter degradation of their style
of living. Worship of stars, planets, mountains, rivers, trees, animals,
snakes, stones and human genitals was rife in India. One can easily
infer from this the depth of terrible darkness prevailing in India at
that time.

The Country of Arabia

83

China
The countries mentioned above lie around Arabia and these alone are
taken as civilized . Only China may be added to this list. China was
worse than all the others. The mixture of Confucianism, Taoism and
Buddhism had made a mess of the cultural and moral condition of
China. However, peace returned to China only when a band of Muslims
settled in China and impressed their neighbors with their high moral
examples. Human populations existed in Turkistan, Russia, and Europe
too but either they were unknown to the rest of the world or they
could hardly be called humans and they possessed no enviable
qualities.

Conclusion
From the states and conditions observed above, it can be easily
understood that, before or at the time of Muhammad ti being
commissioned as Prophet, the entire world had steeped in darkness.
A state of ignorance had overtaken the entire inhabited part of the
earth in a manner that not even a twinkling light of hope and
guidance was visible. Never before had such a state came to pass
when civilization, society, morality, knowledge, wisdom, and
knowledge of Allah had perished everywhere at the same time.
The whole inhabited earth had been sent the guidance of Allah the
Almighty, which kept coming to every country, and the sight of light
and darkness continued appearing alternately like days and nights
until night spread over the whole world. The time was right for the
Prophet of Truth to be sent to all the countries of the world. Allah the
Almighty put to an end the teachings brought by the former Prophets.
He brought to the surface the dire need for a new guide and leader for
every part of the world. Thus the sad plight of the mankind was
thirsting for a new guide. Allah the Almighty chose Arabia to be the
place of Prophethood and the birthplace of His Perfect Messenger and
Guide. Thus the sun of Prophethood rose from Makkah to dispel
darkness from the inhabited parts of the earth and illuminated the
whole world with its bright rays.

The Country of Arabia

85

This book is inspired by this same rising sun. But, before coming to
this point, the answer to the question why Arabia was chosen for the
Prophethood of Muhammad ~ demands answers. Why was he not
sent to any other country?

The Choice of Arabia
The most reasonable and definite answer to this question is that the
last Prophet had, after all, to be born in any one particular country
and so the question arises in every case. So, the question becomes
meaningless.
Another answer to the question is that all the well-known countries
had at one time attained progress and development and achieved
distinction in the sphere of civilization, society, ethics and science.
Moreover, every country had tasted victory and defeat in due course.
No language of any other country of the world had achieved such
perfection as Arabic, which had surpassed other languages in the
power of expression.

If the Prophet ~ had been sent to any country other than Arabia, the
message of the last Prophet ~ would have encountered complications
due to the past and the previous history of victories and defeats and
possession of or possession by the chosen country. There was also the
risk of his message losing its power and grace and a part thereof
might have been attributed to ancient traditions of the chosen
country. The magnificent task of redressing civilization, character and
spiritual values could not have been accomplished and all his
endeavors would be lost in the ancient customs and tr2ditions of the
country concerned .
Moreover, any complete book of guidance is in need of a language
superior to all others in power of expression, and no language was
more appropriate than Arabic to bear the heavy spiritual and
intellectual burden of Revelation. So, by any logic and reason, the last
Prophet~ must have honored Arabia as his birth place.
The people of Arabia neither became subject of any foreign power nor
captured and ruled over any other country. Thus, to the Arabs, every

86

The History of Islam

nation or every country was alike. When they came out with Islam, all
the civilized countries and nations from Spain on the eastern coast of
Atlantic Ocean to China on the western coast of Chinese Sea, the
entire human population was equally strange to them. Thus, Allah the
Almighty sent his religion through a nation for whom the whole
world was equally strange.
Since the Arabian character, civilization and society were far from
progress and development, it was obvious that it was this universal
religion that made them highly civilized, morally disciplined, and a
graceful nation, and the teachers and leaders of the world. The
spiritual power of the Prophet~ was so tremendous that every nation
in every period during his time and after him benefited from him.
Moreover, the Qur'an is the culmination of all the teachings imparted
by all the Prophets and guides.
The above last few sentences may be considered strange to the
concrete principles of history writing. Since, this book of history is
solely meant for Muslim readership and I, too, am a Muslim by the
Grace of Allah the Almighty, I cannot take back these words, which
have naturally come from my pen . Whether I am expelled from the
assembly of the historians or not, I shall feel happy if I am left to join
the company of the Muslim Ummah.

Chapter 2

Prophet Muhammad ~

The Dawn of Guidance
A little before sunrise, a soft light starts appearing from the east. As
stated previously, the entire world was engulfed in the darkness of
ignorance and disbelief. When the time came for the end of the dark
night, the dawn broke to give glad tidings of the rising sun. Arabia
which was then the center of darkness and whose deserts were facing
the storms and evils of paganism, gradually began to show signs of
the sun of Prophethood coming out and a stream of guidance gushing
forth.
Nations of Arabia were living the life of moral depravity, ignorance
and deviation. But right from the birth of the Prophet :I;, Arabian
tribes began to show signs of noble sentiments and the dislike of evil.
Waraqah bin Naufal bin Asad bin Abdul-Uzza, Uthman bin AlHuwairith bin Asad and Zaid bin Amr bin Nafil-the uncle of Umar
bin Khattab, and Ubaidullah bin Jahsh assembled at a place and
began to think over their beliefs and actions. At last, each one of them
showed disgust at the worship of idols and stones and set out to
various places in search of the religion brought by Ibrahim ~\.
Waraqah bin Naufal accepted Christianity and went through the
Torah and the Gospel with rapt attention. Ubaidullah bin Jahsh found
himself unshaken in the quest for religion seeking the worship of one
God till Islam appeared and he earnestly erri.,raced it. Then he

History of Islam

88

migrated to Abyssinia and became a Christian. Uthman bin
Huwairith joined Caesar of Rome and accepted Christianity. Zaid bin
Amr neither accepted Judaism nor Christianity nor continued to tread
the path of idolatry. He acknowledged as unlawful the use of blood
and dead animals and gave up bloodshed and severing of ties with
relatives. On inquiry he would say that he worshipped the Lord of
Ibrahim ~ 1,, decried idolatry and counseled his people to desist from
evil acts. He would often say:
"O Allah, had I been aware of the manner of worshipping, I
would have worshipped none but You Alone and sought Your
Pleasure. But I am unknown to the patil of Your Pleasure."
Saying this he would fell down in prostration.
Even the soothsayers and astronomers began to say that a grand Prophet
was about to be born in Arabia. Both Jews and Christians populated
Arabia. Thus, scholars of both the religions gave the people glad tidings
from the Torah and the Gospel of the coming of a great Prophet.
The King of Abyssinia had captured Yemen for a very short period.
During the lifetime of Abdul-Muttalib, Yemen was under the rule of
the King of Abyssinia. Those days Abrahah Ashram was the governor
of Yemen on behalf of the king. He built a temple in Yemen and
persuaded the Arabs to perform Hajj at the temple of Yemen instead
of the Ka'bah. He was not crowned with success in his movement.
Moreover, an Arab, in order to put him to disgrace, d efecated in the
temple. Abrahah grew so furious that he invaded Makkah with the
intention of destroying the House of Allah-the Ka'bah. He also used
elephants in his attack, so the people of Makkah called them the
people of the Elephant and the year came to be known as the year of
the Elephant. When the Quraish came to know of the attack, they
were filled with fear, as they were no match for such a large and
strong army. They jointly requested their chief, Abdul-Muttalib to go
to Abrahah and explore a way to avert the battle. When AbdulMuttalib presented himself to Abrahah, he was greatly impressed and
held him in high esteem. Abdul-Muttalib stated that Abrahah's army
had captured two hundred camels, which belonged to him.
Thereupon Abrahah remarked that he took him to be a wise person

Prophet Muhammad jj

89

but he obviously was mistaken. He (Abdul-Muttalib) was quite aware
that Abrahah had come with the sole purpose of demolishing the
House of Allah-the Ka'bah. But, intentionally ignoring the topic, he
only spoke of his camels instead of saving the Ka'bah. Abdul-Muttalib
said:
"I am merely owner of the camels, but this House also has an
Owner and He will save it."
The answer enraged Abrahah and he burst out in anger saying he
would see if the Lord of the House would save it. His army was
destroyed and left like an empty field from which all the corn has
been eaten up and only the straw with stalks and stubble was left. The
complete rout of Abrahah's forces after the daring reply of AbdulMuttalib was a very significant event for Arabia which put great fear of
Allah in their hearts.

I

I After that fateful event, the rule of Yemen went out of the hands of the
Abyssinian king and Saif bin Dhi Yazin captured the country. AbdulMuttalib took some nobles of Quraish and went to congratulate Saif on
j his victory. Saif bin Dhi Yazin gave Abdul-Muttalib glad tidings that the
I last Prophet would be raised from his (Abdul-Muttalib's) offspring. This
prophecy found wide currency and fame. All the members of the
delegation thought that the last Prophet would be raised from their
progeny. Each of them contacted the soothsayers and monks hoping for
good news but returned disappointed.

I

On the occasion of an important Prophet or Messenger's birth or
declaration, the stars in large number would be seen shooting in the
sky. Thus close to the birth of last Prophet ~ ' bright flames appeared
in the sky and the scholars of the Scriptures foretold that the time of
the birth of the last Prophet ~ was near. Thus on Rabi' Al-Awwal 9, in
the year of the Elephant corresponding to April 22, 571 CE on
Monday, the last Prophet * was born at dawn before sunrise.

Almighty caused a stream of water to flow in the empty desert. Hajira
contained the flowing water by building a mound around it and it
turned into a well. At the time of leaving Makkah, Jurhum tribe
covered it with dust and so for a long time it became traceless. When
the task of giving water to the pilgrims was entrusted to AbdulMuttalib, he started searching for it along with his elder son Harith,
but their efforts proved fruitless.

The Father of Muhammad :I
One day Abdul-Muttalib saw in his dream the location of the well of
Zamzam and started digging for it. In that spot two idols Isaf and
Nailah were being kept. The Quraish resented this disturbance and
became hostile and ready to fight. Although they were only two,
father and son, they dominated the scene and continued digging the
well. Realizing his isolation Abdul-Muttalib invoked Allah the
Almighty that in case He gave him ten sons, he would sacrifice one of
his sons in the name of God. After a short period the well appeared
and he was also blessed with ten sons.
The appearance of the Zamzam well established the prestige of
Abdul-Muttalib over the Quraish and all of them acknowledged his
leadership and virtues. When his sons had grown, he got ready to
fulfil his vow. He went to the Ka'bah along with all his sons and drew
lots before Hubal. By chance the arrows of chance chose his youngest
son, Abdullah who was very dear to Abdul-Muttalib. Since AbdulMuttalib was adamant in fulfilling his vow, he left for the altar along
with Abdullah.
All his brothers, sisters and chiefs of the Quraish tried hard to hold
Abdul-Muttalib back from implementing his plan but he remained
unshaken. After much discussion they turned to Saja', a famous
soothsayer. She pointed out that blood money for their (AbdulMuttalib' s) clan was ten camels. Thus they should put Abdullah on
one side and ten camels on the other and then draw the lots.
In the case that the camels were chosen they would be slaughtered,
but if Abdullah is chosen they should add ten more camels and draw
again. They should keep adding to the number of the camels until the

camels were drawn. This exercise went on until the number of camels
reached one hundred. Abdul-Muttalib drew the lots twice more for
his personal satisfaction but each time it fell upon the camels. Hence
one hundred camels were slaughtered and Abdullah was saved. Since
that time, the blood money of one killed was fixed at one hundred
camels. The table of genealogy of Abdul-Muttalib is given on the
facing page.

The Birth of the Prophet ii
Only a few days before the year of Elephant, Abdul-Muttalib married
his son, Abdullah to Aminah bint Wahb belonging to a noble family
of the Quraish in Yathrib (Al-Madinah). Abdullah was then 24. On the
same occasion Abdul-Muttalib himself married Halah bint Wuhaib, a
relative of Aminah. Hamzah was born from his marriage to Halah
bint Wuhaib.
A few days after the marriage, Abdul-Muttalib sent Abdullah to Syria
along with a trade caravan. On his return, Abdullah fell sick and
stayed in Yathrib (Al-Madinah) with his relatives and sent his father
news about his illness. Abdul-Muttalib sent his son Harith to bring
Abdullah back to Makkah under his care and protection. But
Abdullah died before Harith reached Al-Madinah and was already
buried in the graveyard of his relatives, Banu Najjar.
Harith came back to Makkah empty-handed and gave AbdulMuttalib this soul shattering news. Abdullah had left behind a few
camels, goats and a slave-girl, Umm Aiman. Aminah was then
pregnant and so the Prophet ~ became an orphan while still in the
womb of his mother.
He ~ was born 52 or 55 days after the event of the year of Elephant.
His mother had dreamt an angel telling her that the baby to be born
had been named Ahmad. Thus she named him Ahmad, while AbdulMuttalib named his grandson Muhammad. According to the report of
Abul-Fida, when the people asked Abdul-Muttalib as to why he gave
his grandson a new name, setting aside all the names current in his
family, he replied: "It is because I have a longing that my grandson
should be praised and commended by one and all in the world."

94

History of Islam

Childhood Days
Initially, after his birth, Thuwaibah, the freed slave-girl of Abu Lahab
bin Abdul-Muttalib suckled him for · seven days. She had suckled
Hamzah, the uncle of the Prophet ~ also. Thus both Masruh bin
Thuwaibah and Hamzah • were his foster brothers. According to the
custom of the Arab nobles, on the eighth day he was entrusted to lady
Halimah of the Banu Sa'd clan of the Hawazin tribe to suckle him and
bring him up. The nobles of Arabia would entrust their babies to
bedouin women so that they would become healthy and strong in the
open and free climate of the desert. Besides it would help develop
eloquent speech, because the language of the bedouin was more pure,
graceful and eloquent than those living in urban areas.
Halimah Sa'diyah would come to Makkah twice a year to show him
to his mother and grandfather. Halimah Sa'diyah suckled him for two
years and he remained with her for four years altogether. His mother
summoned him to Makkah at the end of four years. When he was six,
his mother took him to his relatives in Al-Madinah (Yathrib). On the
return journey after a month, she passed away at Abwa. AbdulMuttalib took upon himself the responsibilities of looking after the
boy. According to other narrations, he~ remained with Banu Sa'd for
five years. He ~ was five years of age and he was out grazing goats
along with his foster brother and sisters and other boys of the same
age when the event of the opening up of his chest occurred.
According to a narration of Seerat lbn Hisham, Halimah bint Abu
Dhuaib relates this event in these words: "One day both of my
children came fearfully to me and said that two cleanly dressed
persons seized our Quraishi brother and split open his chest. I went to
the spot along with my husband (Harith bin Abdul-Uzza) and saw
that he~ was sitting there with his face turned pale. Upon inquiry he
stated that two cleanly dressed persons came to him, laid him down
with his face up, took out his heart, and extracted something from it."
But Halimah found no trace of any injury or spot of blood. Having
thought that the boy was affected by a jinn or something, she brought
him to Makkah without loss of time and related the whole event to his
mother. But his mother instead of being afraid of what had happened, ,

I

Prophet Muhammad Ji

95

spoke with all the confidence at her command that her son would
achieve a very distinctive place in the world, and would surely
remain safe from all calamities. She told that when he was in her
womb, she heard many things from the angels and noticed many
uncommon happenings. Imam Muslim reports from Anas bin Malik
~ that one day when he 1i was playing with the boys of Makkah,
Jibril (Gabriel) ~\ came to him, split his chest, took out a black drop
from it and said: "It was the portion of Satan." Following that he
! washed his heart in a tray of gold with Zamzam water and then put it
Iin its place.

Death of Abdul-Muttalib

I of Abdul-Muttalib, he :I reached eight years of age that AbdulI Muttalib passed away. When Abdul-Muttalib's funeral procession

I was proceeding, he :I joined it with tearful eyes. However, AbdulI Muttalib had entrusted him to his son Abu Talib before his death,
I stressing the utmost care and protection for the boy. Despite having
I several other sons, Abdul-Muttalib was wise enough to give him to
I the care of Abu Talib because he and Abdullah, the father of the boy,

iwere born of the same mother. The assessment of Abdul-Muttalib
j came true and the nephew became Abu Talib' s favorite.

Abu Talib took special care of his nephew and held him.·dearer than
his own sons. He made him sleep on his own bed. He :I passed his
Ichildhood days in a manner quite strange for the Arabian society.
IInstead of playing with children of his age group, he felt disgusted in
their company and preferred to be in solitude. Allah the Almighty
had kept him aloof from every kind of debasement and depravity. A
few boys of Quraish forced him to enjoy a marriage celebration where
there was dance and music too. But as he reached the spot he was
overtaken by sleep and kept sleeping the whole night and got up only
when the assembly had dispersed at the end of the celebration. He :I
was thus saved from the undesirable and forbidden activities of the
marriage ceremony.

History of Islam

He ~ was, perhaps, seven years old when the Quraish started rebuilding the Ka'bah which had suffered damage from a flood. During
the construction work, he ~ joined the party of workers carrying
stones and giving them to the masons. He was wearing Izar (waist
sheet) which was causing him some trouble doing the work. The
nakedness of a boy of seven was not then considered something
improper. So, his uncle Abbas grabbed hold of the waist sheet and
pulled it so violently that he~ became naked. He grew shameful to
the extent that he fell down unconscious. At last, the people felt the
gravity of the situation and put his waist sheet back on and he
recovered.

First Journey to Syria
He ~ was twelve years old when Abu Talib planned to go with a
merchant caravan to Syria leaving him behind in Makkah. But he~
was so used to the company of Abu Talib that he could not bear
separation from his uncle. Abu Talib felt moved and agreed to take
him to Syria. When the caravan reached Busra, the southeastern part
of Syria, a Christian monk named Bahira saw and recognized him as
the Last Prophet. He came to Abu Talib and let him know that his
nephew was set to become a Prophet as he had noticed with him all
the signs of Prophethood written in the Torah and the Gospel. He
then advised Abu Talib to hurry back with his nephew. Abu Talib
acted upon the advice.

Harb AI-Fijar, First Participation in Battle
A great fair was regularly held at Ukaz. This fair would organize a
number of programs including horse races, wrestling, demonstrations
of the art of combat and poetic competitions. AJI the tribes of Arabia
were highly belligerent by nature and drew swords against one
another at the smallest incident.
Once, in the course of the fair at Ukaz, the Hawazin and Quraish
tribes challenged each other due to a slight provocation. At the outset
some wise and sober people stood in the way and put the matter right.
But some mischief-mongers worsened the situation which led to
large-scale fighting and killing on both sides. The war was known as

iProphet Muhammad ;J!i

arb· Al-Fijdr because it took place in the month of Dhul-Qa'dah when
ighting was altogether forbidden . This war was based on a series of
our wars in which three firsts were small and the fourth war
appened to be more fierce than the preceding one as all the tribes of
ais joined the Hawazin tribe while all the tribes of Kinanah came to the
elp of the Quraish. Thus this war developed to become a war
etween the Qais and Kinanah tribes. The fourth and the last war was
o terrible that some of the chieftains had their feet chained so they
ouldn' t leave from the field of battle.

he Prophet :i; joined this fourth war for the first time armed with
eapons. Among Banu Kinanah, every tribe had its separate
ommander. Thus the commander of Banu Hashim was Zubair bin
bdul-Muttalib, an uncle of the Prophet :i; while Harb bin Umayyah
as the commander of all the troops of Banu Kinanah. Muhammad :i;
as then fifteen or twenty years of age. He was entrusted with the
ervice of picking up the arrows for his uncles. However, he was
aved from combat action. At the outset Banu Hawazin seemed to be
:laminating, but at last, Banu Kinanah turned the table against the
anu Qais and war ended on peace treaty.

lrrade
~hen the Prophet :i; became a young man, he turned towards trade
s a vocation. His uncle Abu Talib also liked this work for his
1ephew. Several times he accompanied trade caravans with his
erchandise and every time he returned with a substantial profit. The
eople during these journeys had ample opportunity to observe his
ualities of honest dealings and graceful behavior. Besides, all those
n Makkah with whom he entered into business terms, became
itness to his trusty, truthful, upright and gracious character.
Companion, Abdullah bin Abul-Hamsa relates: "Before his
eputation to the Prophethood, I had entered into a business dealing
ith the Prophet :i;. The dealing was not yet concluded when I had to
eave for another place in haste. But, before leaving I asked the
rophet ~ to wait until 1 returned to finalize the deal. After taking
from him I forgot our appointment and when I returned by the
'ame route on the third day, I found the Prophet :i; waiting at the

people often referred to the name of that organization in their
conversations. After the Harb Al-Fijiir, Zubair bin Abdul-Muttalib, an
uncle of the Prophet ~ felt the need of reviving the movement. Thus a
few people assembled at the house of Abdullah bin Jad'an and
pledged afresh to combat the oppressors and help the oppressed. The
Prophet also joined that pledge.
After a period he ·~ brought to the chieftains and distinguished
people around him the idea to rise as one man to redeem the Arab
society from evils like oppression, highway robbery, excesses
perpetrated on the weak and the poor on the part of the strong and
wealthy. His sincere efforts brought fruit and an organization of Banu
Hashim, Banu Al-Muttalib, Banu Asad, Banu Zuhrah and Banu
Tamim was set up. Every member had to pledge: (1) We shall wipe
out disorder from the country; (2) Safeguard the travelers and
wayfarers; (3) Help the poor; and (4) Check the tyrants from doing
wrong. The organization served the people gracefully. During his
Prophethood he ~ would say: "If I were invited to have a hand in it
even after the advent of Islam, I would have undoubtedly joined
again."

Appointed as Arbitrator by the Quraish
The Ka'bah once caught fire due to some carelessness causing deep
cracks in its walls. The Quraish agreed to rebuild it but none was
ready to demolish it for fear of being overtaken by some calamity. At
last, W alid bin Mughirah among the chieftains began it. Other tribes
eventually joined the demolition work. About the same time a ship
suffered wreckage near the port of Jeddah. The Quraish bought the
wooden parts of the broken ship. When the construction work
reached up to the point where the Hajar Aswad (Black Stone) was to be
placed, a serious dispute erupted, for the chieftain of every tribe
wanted to place the sacred relic into its place. They were ready to
fight and swords were drawn. The impasse continued for five days.
At last the Quraish tribes assembled at the Ka'bah and a meeting was
immediately convened. Abu Umayyah bin Mughirah brought
forward a suggestion that the man first to enter the gate of the Ka'bah
would be made umpire in the matter of a dispute. The first man to

102

History of Islam

come in was Allah's Messenger~- "This is Muhammad," they said as
soon as they saw him coming. "He is trustworthy and we all agree to
his decision." The fact that every tribe was desirous for and claimed
the honor was understandable. However, in their classical destructive
manner they were all making pledges to fight unto death by thrusting
their fingers into a bowl full of blood according to the custom of the
times. It was in this atmosphere that they entrusted to the Prophet :l;
this major responsibility and honor with all the different factions
satisfied and in agreement. This is irrefutable proof of the fact that
they all had profound faith in his honesty and justice. He ~ first
acquainted himself with the matter and then put an end to the dispute
quickly so that all the people, old and experienced were left
wondering at his sagacity, power of decision and sense of justice. All
of them raised their voices in appreciation.
The Prophet ~ asked them to bring a piece of cloth. He ~ took the
Black Stone and put it on the cloth, and asked each tribe to take hold
of an end of the cloth and lift it to the required height. When the
people lifted the stone in the proper manner, the Prophet ~ placed it
in its position with his own hands, and the building went on above it.
Utbah bin Rabi'ah bin Abd Shams, Aswad bin Muttalib bin Asad bin
Abdul-Uzza, Abu Hudhaifah bin Mughirah bin Umar bin Makhzum
and Qais bin Adi As-Sahmi were the four persons most deeply
involved in the dispute but they, too returned happy and satisfied.
Had a war broken out, it would have left all the past wars behind in
ferocity and bloodshed. The Prophet :I; was only thirty-five years of
age when He ~ brought an end to the dispute of Black Stone.

Support for the Poor
He ~ had excelled all others in Makkah with respect to honor and
popularity, and he had no enemy throughout Arabia. His wisdom,
uprightness, honesty and trustworthiness were the talk of the country.
He was a trader by profession and he was passing his life in easy
circumstances after his marriage with Khadijah~". Once famine broke
out, Abu Talib had to shoulder the responsibility of a big family, and
despite being the chieftain of Banu Hashim, he passed his days in
poverty and want. Having seen his plight, the Prophet ~ told his

Prophet Muhammad :Jr

103

uncle, Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib about the famine and the difficulties
that Abu Talib was facing. He further said that it would be better if

they each took one of his sons under their care. Abbas agreed and
both of them went to Abu Talib and expressed their desire. Abu Talib
gave his consent for Ali and Ja'far. Thus Ali was taken by the Prophet
;j and Ja'far by Abbas. This happened the same year when the Ka'bah
was rebuilt.

His Love for laid bin Harithah
Hakim bin Haram, the nephew of Khadijah ~ had purchased a slave
and offered him to his father's sister, Khadijah ~, who gave him to
the Prophet ;j. It was this slave who was known as Zaid bin Harithah.
He belonged to an Arbian family but was captured during plunder
and sold as a slave. When Zaid's father Harithah and his uncle Ka'b
came to know that Zaid lived with a man in Makkah as his slave, both
of them went to Makkah and requested the Prophet ~ to release Zaid.
He ~ granted their request at once and said that Zaid was at liberty to
accompany them if he so desired.
Zaid was· then sent for. He ~ asked him, "Do you know these two?"
Zaid replied, "Yes! They are my father and uncle." He ~ then said,
"They have come to take you with them. I give you permission to
accompany them." Zaid replied, "I can't part company with you."
Thereupon Zaid's father rebuked him and said, "Do you prefer
slavery to liberty?" Zaid answered back, "I have noticed in
Muhammad ~ such things that I can prefer none to him in the whole
universe." Having heard this reply of Zaid, the Prophet ~ got up,
took Zaid with him and entering Ka'bah cried in a loud voice: "O
people! Be witness to it that today I set Zaid free and adopt him as my
son, this is my heir from today and I am his." This moving sight
delighted both the father and uncle of Zaid and they went away
leaving their son in the company of the Prophet ~From that day the boy came to be called Zaid bin Muhammad instead
of Zaid bin Harithah until Revelation was sent to the Prophet ~ after
his emigration that an adopted son cannot be a substitute for one's
own son. Thus he returned to the name Zaid bin Harithah. But he
enjoyed the love and affection of the Prophet ~ in the same measure

104

History of Islam

and it kept increasing with the passage of time. This particular event
also tells a lot about the treatment and manners of Muhammad :i
before being elevated to the lofty position of Prophethood.

Inclined to Allah
He :i was 32 or 33 years of age when he developed in himself a love
for solitude and privacy. He so often saw a strange light, which led
him to feel a unique joy, although he never saw any figure nor heard
any voice. He :i naturally abhorred polytheism. Once during a
meeting, the pagans served him some food which had already been
dedicated to the idols. He :i put it aside towards Zaid bin Amr. But
he also refused to eat from it and said addressing the pagans: "We do
not eat from the food that was offered to idols." This Zaid bin Amr
bin Nufail was the uncle of Umar bin Khattab ~During the hours of privacy and solitude, he :i would ponder over
the Divine powers and kept praising and glorifying his Lord. The
more he :i was drawing near the age of forty, the more he felt
attracted to privacy. He would very often go to the Cave of Hira,
taking with him parched barley meal and water, to pray Allah in
perfect peace and privacy and returned only when the supplies would
run short. The Mount of Hira, now known as Jabal Nur (Mountain of
Light), has a cave. It is situated at a distance of three miles from
Makkah towards the north on the way to Mina. The cave has a length
of four yards and a breadth of three-quarters of a yard . During those
days he had true dreams and had dreams in the night about the
happenings of the next day. About seven years passed in the same
state, but during the last six months he frequently had true dreams.

Sunrise
Muhammad :i was forty years old and now rose the sun of
Prophethood. When the power of endurance and shouldering the
heavy burden of Revelation had attained full growth by constant
prayers, ceaseless exercises and deep reflection in solitude, an angel
appeared before him and said addressing him, "Read." The Prophet
:i answered, "I cannot read." The angel took and pressed him and

J

Prophet Muhammad .~

105

IIthen let him go and said again, "Read." The Prophet ~ replied for the
second time, "I cannot read." The angel again pressed him tightly and
then letting him go said, "Read." When the Prophet~ replied once
again, "I cannot read." He took him and pressed tightly a third time in
the same manner. He then let the Prophet ~ go and said:
"Read! In the Name of your Lord who has created,
"Created man from a clot.
"Read! and your Lord is the Most Generous,
"Who has taught by the pen,
"Has taught man that which he knew not." (96:1-5)
Having said this the angel disappeared, but dizzy and frightened, the
Messenger ~ came back home and went to Khadijah ~ and said:
"Wrap me up, wrap me up," Khadijah i~ wrapped him up in a
blanket. When he ~ regained peace of mind after a short while, he
related to Khadijah ~ what had happened to him with the remark, "I
feel my life threatened."

Historic Words of Khadijah~
Khadijah ik said in reply:
"By no means, I swear to Allah that He would never put you to
shame. You join the ties of relationship, you speak the truth,
you bear people's burdens, you help the destitute, you entertain
guests and you mitigate the pains and grief suffered for the
sake of truth."
After comforting and encouraging her husband, she took him to her
cousin Waraqah bin Naufal, who had grown old by then. When the
Prophet ~ told him what he had seen and heard, W araqah cried out'.
"There has come unto you the same Namus, who had come unto
Prophet Moses aforetime. Had I been young and living by the time
when your people will cast you out." The Prophet~ demanded from
Waraqah, "What? will they expel me?" "Yes," replied Waraqah, "for
whenever a Messenger of Allah came and preached Tauhid (Oneness
of Allah) he was maltreated and put to untold miseries." Afterwards
the Prophet ~ kept visiting the Cave of Hira. But no Revelation came
to him for sometime.

106

History of Islam

One day he ;i was on his way home from the Cave of Hira when he ~
sighted the same angel and got frightened. He hurried back home and
wrapped himself up in a mantle and lay down. In the meantime he
heard a majestic voice saying:
"O you wrapped up in garments! Arise and warn; And
magnify your Lord; And purify your garments; And keep away
from abomination, polytheism and evils." (74:1-5)
From then on Revelation kept coming after short intervals. One day
Jibril (Gabriel), the Trusty took the Prophet~ to the foot of a hill and
performed Wudu' (ablution) before the Prophet~ and the latter did
the same. Afterwards Jibril, the Trusty led the prayer.

Preaching of Islam
He ii embarked upon preaching Tauhid (Oneness of Allah) as he received
the Command of Allah to do so. He started the task of keeping people
away from polytheism and inviting to Tauhid right from his household,
with the result that Khadijah ~ was the first to embrace Islam. Ali bin
Abu Talib~ and Zaid bin Harithah ~ were also converted to Islam the
very first day. These all belonged to his household. Abu Bakr bin Abu
Quhafah ~ who was the Prophet's friend, accepted Islam the same day.
Now, the individuals to become Muslims on the first day were his family
members and his best friend. These were the people who knew the
Prophet ~ well and were aware of his traits and character for a very long
time, and no aspect of his life was a secret to them. Now, their embracing
of Islam the very first day was an outstanding proof of his truthfulness
and uprightness.
At the outset, he kept his teachings and preaching quiet, limiting them
to his relatives and close friends. In the earliest period of the
preaching of Islam, Abu Bakr ~ extended his services most
prominently. He had a very wide and large circle of friends and
acquaintances under his influence, which brought Uthman bin Affan,
Talhah bin Ubaidullah, Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas, Abdur Rahman bin
Auf, and Zubair bin Awwam ,$, to the fold of Islam. Uthman bin
Maz'un, Qudamah bin Maz'un, Saeed bin Zaid, Fatimah-the sister of
Umar bin Khattab and wife of Saeed ,$, were next to join the caravan

Prophet Muhammad j/t

107

of Islam. Another band to enter the circle of Islam constituted
individuals like Umair, the brother of Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas, Abdullah
bin Mas'ud, and Ja'far bin Abu Talib ,$,. Thus came into being a small
group of Muslim men, women, youths, old men and children. The
believing men would go beyond Makkah in the mountain pass to
pray to Allah for fear of their lives. Three years passed silently and
secretly in preaching Islam, and people renouncing the abominable
life of polytheism and idolatry came running to the fold of Islam. But,
during this span of three years, every assembly and company of the
Quraish was agog with the stir created by Islam. They had nothing to
discuss but the new religion.
The Quraish, at the outset, attached no importance to the movement
of Islam nor did it look menacing in its early stage. Thus they didn't
go beyond poking fun at the believers, jeering at them and hurting
them verbally. However, in some cases, mischief-mongers among
them inflicted physical troubles on individual Muslims also. Once
Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ was performing prayers in a mountain pass
along with a few Muslims. All of a sudden a few pagans passed by
them and tried to hold the Muslims back from doing so by force. Sa'd
bin Abu Waqqas rose against them and a disbeliever received an
injury from his sword. This was the first sword fight in the cause of
Allah the Almighty.
Once the Prophet ~ and Ali ~ were performing prayers in a
mountain pass. By chance, Abu Talib arrived at the scene and kept
silent watching them. When the prayer was over, he said, "What's this
religion that you have adopted?" "This is the Religion of Ibrahim."
They said, and added, "you should also accept it." Abu Talib replied,
"I shall not renounce the religion of my ancestors," and said turning
to Ali ~,"My son! Never part company with Muhammad. I am sure
he will lead you to nothing but good."

Proclamation of Truth from Mount of Safa
Now came the Revelation:
"Therefore proclaim openly that which you are commanded."
(15:94)

History of Islam

108

With this order the Prophet ~ ascended the Mount of Safa and gave a
call to each and every tribe by name in a raised voice. Having heard
this call, the people in a large number gathered in front of him
according to the practice of Arabia. Thereafter he~ said addressing
them, "O Quraish! If I tell you that your enemy is about to attack you,
would you believe me?" They unanimously replied, "Yes." "We have
always found you truthful and trustworthy." Having heard this
answer, the Prophet~ said to them, "Well, I am a warner to you before
a severe chastisement overtakes you." Hearing this they burst into
laughter, Abu Lahab exclaimed, "May you perish. Is it for this you have
brought us here?" Following this the people dispersed. As Abu Lahab
left, Surat Al-Masad (111) was revealed.
After a few days he ~ was ordered:
"And warn your kith and kin." (26:214)
Following this the Prophet ~ asked Ali bin Abu Talib ~ to throw a
party and invite his relatives. About forty persons attended it. At the end
of the feast the Prophet ~ rose to say something but nonsensical
utterances of Abu Lahab took away from the Prophet~ an opportunity
to warn them of the consequences of their evil doings. After a gap of a
few days another feast was arranged and as his relatives finished their
meal, the Prophet ::i rose to say, "Look! I have come to you with
something that none else ever brought for his tribe. Tell me who will lend
his support to me in this task?" Hearing this nobody made any
response but Abu Talib assured him of his support.

Open endeavor to preach
The Prophet ~ gave the call to Tauhid (Oneness of Allah) and Islam .
During this period his small and weak band of people had to bear the
brunt of their new faith. In assemblies and gatherings, in fairs and
market places, and by contacting people at their homes, he would
teach people the virtues of Tauhid (Oneness of Allah) and forbid them
from idolatry. Adultery gambling, lying, embezzlement, theft, and
robbery were made taboo. The Quraish were proud people. It was not
easy for them to put up with derogatory remarks against their
ancestors' faith and practices. They were also very particular about

Prophet Muhammad ?fi

109

· the distinction between slaves and their masters. But Islam believed in
. the equality of both of them. The Quraish and the Makkans were held
, in high esteem by all the tribes in Arabia only due to the idols that
! they would come to Makkah to worship. Islam was, on the other
; hand, the sworn enemy of idolatry. The chieftains and respectable
men of Makkah could not step down from their positions and follow
the Prophet ~. Most of the tribes were at enmity with Banu Hashim,
so they could not accept a man from a rival tribe to lead them. Thus
open preaching ignited the fire of hostility and antagonism all over
Arabia which turned into a blaze during the fourth year of the
Prophethood.

First Educational Institution
About the same period, the Prophet ~ set up the house of Arqam bin
Abu Arqam at the bottom of the Mount of Safa as an educational
institution. Every new convert would come to this institution to learn
the teachings of Islam. Gradually it became a crowded place and the
Prophet ~ would lead the prayer. This house served as the center of
all Islamic activities and the dwelling of the Prophet ~ for three years.
Those who joined the Islamic movement at this stage are considered
to be the Foremost Muslims. The last to embrace Islam in Dar Arqam
was Umar bin Khattab ~. His acceptance of Islam proved a turning
point in the Islamic movement.

Antagonism of the Quraish
Among the entrants to Islam some were slaves and some of them had
no powerful tribes or relatives to defend them. Such weak and
powerless people became the easy victims of the disbelievers and
suffered physical tortures. Muslims in general were put to ridicule of
the most unkind nature so that others would not dare join the new
faith. Bilal ~ was the slave of Umayyah bin Khalaf who put him to
great torture. He used to bring him out at noontime and throw him on
his back on the burning sand, ordering a heavy hot rock to be placed
on his chest. At times his both arms were tied behind and he was
lashed mercilessly. Sometimes he was kept hungry and handed over
to street urchins with a rope tied round his neck and they would pull

110

History of Islam

him through the streets and alleys and to the hills beyond the city. But
Bilal ~ would bear all these soul-shattering miseries with Ahad, Ahad
(One, One) upon his lips. Ammar~ embraced Islam along with his
father Yasir ~ and mother Sumaiyah ~ . Abu Jahl tortured them
beyond description. The wicked Abu Jahl stuck his spear in Sumaiyah
,~ and she was honored with martyrdom. Abu Jahl once gave
Zanirah t~, such a severe beating that she became blind. Hairs stand
on end to think of the cruelties committed against the slaves and
slave-girls, the weak and the downtrodden. But Islam is such a
powerful force that nobody went astray and became an apostate
because of these tortures.
Uthman bin Affan ~ was a wealthy man from the Umayyah tribe.
On becoming Muslim he was tied with a rope, thrashed severely and
put to many other physical troubles. Zubair bin Al-Awwam's uncle
tried to control him by wrapping him in a mat. While reciting the
Qur'an, Abu Dhar GhHari ~ was so mercilessly beaten that he fell
unconscious. He was about to be killed, when Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib passed by and asked them to leave him because the Banu
Ghifar tribe inhabited a strategic spot on the route their trade
caravans passed through. Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~ was also beaten to
unconsciousness. Khabbab bin Arntt ~ was once made to lie down
on his back on burning embers and a man sat on his chest so that he
could not move or change sides, with the result that the flesh and skin
of his back and waist were burned off.

Insulting Behavior to the Prophet ~
Once the Prophet ~ was saying his prayers at the Ka 'bah when
Uqbah bin Abu Muait twisted his neck with a piece of cloth until he ~
was nearly strangled. On being informed, Abu Bakr ~ rushed to the
spot and saved the Prophet ~ from the mischief, and then said
addressing the Quraish: "Would you kill a person simply because he
claims that Allah is his Lord?" Thereupon they left the Prophet~ and
grappled with Abu Bakr~ and manhandled him very roughly. Once
the Quraish surrounded the Prophet~ on all sides and began to treat
him rudely and disrespectfully. Harith bin Abu Halah hurried to the
place in order to save him from the clutches of the criminals but the

Prophet Muhammad if

111

disbelievers martyred him. However, they dared not manhandle the
Prophet ;i. Thoms were spread on the way he had to pass in the night
so that his feet were wounded.
Once the Prophet ~ was performing prayers in the courtyard of Ka 'bah
in the presence of the Quraish. Abu Jahl said to the people: "A camel
has been slaughtered at such and such place and its intestines are still
lying there. One should fetch them and put it on Muhammad."
Hearing this, Uqbah bin Abu Muait got up and fetched the intestines
and put it on the back of the Prophet~ when he was prostrating. The
disbelievers were overtaken by laughter. Although Abdullah bin
Mas'ud was present there, he could not muster the courage to do the
needful. By chance, Fatimah btk, who was then of tender age, removed
the intestines from the back of her father reproaching them in strong
words.
They used to throw stones, filth and refuse at his house. Once he~
said, "O Banu Abd Manaf, how well you are at fulfilling the rights of a
neighbor." The Prophet~ was sometimes called a poet and at times he
was branded as a sorcerer, a soothsayer, or insane. In short, the
disbelievers of Makkah left no stone unturned in putting the Prophet ~
and his Companions to the utmost physical and mental torture and
tried to block his mission. But the Prophet ~ was determined to fulfill
his sacred mission with unshakable conviction. When the Quraish were
perfectly convinced that their opposition to the mission would bear no
fruit, they adopted another plan.

An Offer of all earthly Desires and a Plain Reply
The Quraish held consultations over the issue and sent Utbah bin
Rabi'ah to the Prophet ~ with a proposal. He said very politely,
"Muhammad, you are noble and belong to a noble and illustrious
family. But you have created a rift in your people. Tell me what do
you want? If you want to have wealth, we will collect enough of it
that you will be the richest of all of us. If you desire to be a leader, we
will make you our chief and are ready to accept your rule. If you want
to marry someone, we shall arrange your marriage with the most
beautiful lady of the highest and most respectable family and if you
are eager for these simultaneously, we can provide you with all this."

112

History of Islam

When Utbah had finished, the Prophet ~ began to recite Si)rat AsSajdah in response to his speech. When he ~ came to: "But if they turn
away, then say: 'I have warned you of a destructive torment like the
torment which overtook Ad and Thamud ."(41 :13), Utbah turned pale
and put his hand on the mouth of the Prophet ~ requesting him not
to say such things. The Prophet ~ then prostrated and raising his
head said, "Did you get my reply?" Utbah left the place and came
back to the Quraish, and said, "Take my advice and leave this man
alone and be neutral in his case. If he brings Arabia under his control
then, since he is your brother, his success implies your success; and if
he meets his doom, you are happily safe." Hearing this the Quraish
said to Utbah, " It appears Muhammad has cast a spell on you." Utbah
replied, "You say whatever you like, I have already expressed my
opinion:"

Deputation of the Quraish to Abu Talib
When the efforts of Utbah met with failure, a delegation comprising
Utbah, Shebah, Abul-Bukhtari, Aswad, Walid, and Abu Jahl came to
Abu Talib and complained: "Your nephew doesn't refrain from
insulting our idols, make him understand and hold him back from
such moves." Abu Talib replied to them suitably and protested
against their excesses. That day they returned but the very next day
they again came to Abu Talib after consultations. They made the same
suggestions before Abu Talib that Utbah had already put forward.
They began to say, "O Muhammad, we have sent for you to tell you
that none has ever brought so much trouble to the people as you have
done. If you, by this new faith of yours, intend to collect money, we
can amass it for you that which none could excel. We will make you
our chief if you have a longing for rule, we are ready to install you as
our king. If you are possessed by a ghost or a jinni of which you have
no remedy, we will find a skillful physician and soothsayer for you."
Having heard all this, the Prophet ~ recited a few Verses from the
Qur'an in response to what they said, and then said to them, "Allah
the Almighty has sent me as His Messenger to you. I have to convey
His Message. In case you accept my teachings, you will be crowned
with success in both the worlds; if you reject it, I shall be waiting for

Prophet Muhammad ~

the Decision of Allah the Almighty." In response to this call they said,
"Well, if you are the Messenger of God, remove these mountains from
Arabia, make the deserts green, bring our forefathers back to life,
particularly, Qusai bin Kilab. If Qusai bin Kilab, after becoming alive,
accepts you as truthful and accepts your Prophethood, we shall also
follow suit." The Prophet .'.j; said in reply, "I have not been sent as a
Messenger for such things. I have come to convey to you the
commands that Allah the Almighty revealed to me and make you
comprehend them fully. I can't do anything out of my own will."
After this exchange, the chieftains of the Quraish got up in wrath and
left challenging even Abu Talib to rise to face them.
After they left, Abu Talib said to the Prophet '.j; with the utmost
affection, "My nephew, I have now grown old and it is not within my
power to face the onslaught of the Quraish. Put me not in such a
trouble, which is beyond my power. It is fitting for you to hold back
from reviling the idols." Having heard this, the Prophet '.j; replied
with all the confidence at his command, "Dear uncle! If they put the
sun in my right hand and the moon in the left, I shall not forsake it."
What Abu Talib told him created doubt in the mind of the Prophet '.j;
that he intended to withdraw his support for him. Abu Talib
commanded the highest respect among the chieftains of Makkah and
was the universally accepted chief of the Banu Hashim tribe. The
opponents of the Prophet '.j; were reluctant to attack him simply
because of the presence of Abu Talib. Now the disappointing
utterances of Abu Talib filled the eyes of the Prophet '.j; with tears. He
~ got up and walked away saying, "Uncle! I shall not give up my
mission till it is fulfilled or I am undone accomplishing it." When Abu
Talib heard this, he was moved from within and sent for him and
said, "Do keep engaged in your mission; I shall neither withdraw my
support nor consign you to your enemies while it is within my
power."

Migration to Abyssinia
When all their efforts failed and the mission of preaching Tauhid
(Oneness of Allah) remained continuous, they felt the power and
strength of it. Thus they reacted violently and stopped the Prophet~

114

History of Islam

from entering the Ka'bah, and set the louts and riffraff to raise a hue
and cry against him and the believers, calling them bad names and
making their movements impossible, and they didn't allow them to
meet people from outside Makkah. They began to persecute the weak
and the poor more intensely. Life became very hard and almost
impossible to live.
Witnessing this sad and tragic plight of the believers, the Prophet~
allowed them to leave for Abyssinia (where the Christians ruled).
Thus in the month of Rajah, the 5th year of the Prophethood, a band
of eleven men and four women left Makkah for Abyssinia. They
secretly reached the port of Shu'aibah where there was a ship with its
anchor lowered. They boarded the ship and reached Abyssinia.
Among those foremost migra.nts were:
Uthman bin Affan, his wife Ruqayyah (the daughter of the Prophet~),
Hudhaifah bin Utbah, Uthman ·bin Maz'un, Abdullah bin Mas'ud,
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, Zubair bin Al-Awwam, Mus'ab bin Umair,
Amir bin Rabi'ah and Suhail bin Baida ,$,.
These people belonged to the renowned and powerful tribes, which
makes it clear beyond doubt that not only the weak but also the
strong had become the target of their tortures. Finding out about their
migration some of the disbelievers set out chasing them but the ship
had already departed for Abyssinia. The believers found peace there
with the result that other Muslims followed suit.
A few months after the migration, the Muslims came to know that
either the entire Quraish population had turned Muslims or made
peace with the believers, and Makkah was no longer a risky spot for
them. With this good news, a group of Muslims left for Makkah while
others waited to make sure about the truth behind the rumor. Those
leaving for Makkah found the news baseless when they arrived at a
short distance from Makkah. Thus some of them made a retreat while
others entered Makkah under the protection of some influential
Makkans. Those who went back to Makkah came into contact with the
believers and left again for Abyssinia along with other Muslims. This
is known as the Second Migration to Abyssinia, which increased the
number of the Muslims there to nearly one hundred.

Quraish's demand from the King of Abyssinia
When the disbelievers noticed that the Makkans after being converted
to Islam were leaving for Abyssinia and living there in peace, they
feared that their power organized outside of Makkah could, one day,
pose a great danger to the Makkans. They dispatched a delegation of
two respectable persons Amr bin Al-As and Abdullah bin Rabi'ah to
Negus, the King of Abyssinia. The Makkans had trade relations with
Abyssinia for some time. The delegation was sent with costly gifts for
the king and his courtiers. After being permitted into the court, they
first presented their gifts and then requested the king to hand over
some of their slaves who had come to his country after joining a new
faith which was against the faith of their ancestors. The king promised
to look into their demands only after; investigating the matter. The
king then sent for the Muslims to come to his court and inquired
about their new faith. On behalf of the Muslims, Ja'far bin Abu Talib
~ moved forward to explain to Negus the truth about the new faith
in a remarkable speech delivered before the king and his courtiers.

The Beautiful Speech of Ja'far bin Abu Talib ~
"O King, we were people plunged in ignorance. We
worshipped idols, we ate dead animals, and we committed
abominations. We broke natural ties, we ill-treated our
neighbors and our strong devoured the weak. We lived like this
until Allah the Almighty raised among us a Prophet of who~e
noble birth and lineage, truthfulness, honesty and purity we all
were aware. He invited us to acknowledge the Oneness of
Allah and to worship Him. He enjoined us to speak the truth, to
redeem our pledges, to be kind and considerate to our relatives
and neighbors.
He forbade us every vice, bloodshed,
shamelessness, lies and deceit. He asked us not to encroach upon
the belongings of our orphans and not to vilify chaste women.
He ordered us to offer prayers. We acknowledged the
Messenger 1t and believed in him. Because of this our people
were estranged and they persecuted us.

116

History of Islam

"So when they tortured us and tormented us under their
tyranny, we fled to your country. We have come here, 0 King,
to your country seeking your protection and we do hope that
we shall not be dealt with unjustly."
Negus listened patiently to Ja'far bin Abu Talib~- Then he asked
him if he had something brought by his Prophet ~ from God.
Thereupon Ja'far ~ recited the opening Verses of sarat Maryam.
Tears started rolling down from the eyes of Negus and his courtiers.
The recitation being over, Negus remarked, "This and the Torah of
Musa ~I are radiations from the same Heavenly Light." Then the
envoys of the Quraish flung their last attempt and said, "OKing, they
are opponents of Jesus too." By this they wanted the Christian king to
grow angry at the Muslim migrants. Directly came the reply from
Ja'far bin Abu Talib ~' "Not at all; the fact is rather: He is slave of
Allah and His Messenger." Negus said: "This belief is correct to the
core and the Gospel also means the same."
Negus sent the envoys of the Quraish back empty-handed and
refused point-blank to give the Muslims up to them. Along with this
he returned their gifts thus rubbing salt in their wounds. This event
occurred during the sixth year of the Prophethood. With the ignoble
defeat of the Quraish's mission, their ill treatment of the Muslims
simply was aggravated.

Hamzah ~ accepts Islam
The Quraish were going mad with enmity against the Muslims. Once
Abu Jahl happened to pass by the Prophet~ near the mount of Safa.
He insulted the Prophet ~ and heaped· all manners of indignities
upon him but the Prophet ~ did not answer him back. Then he hit
him with a stone, which caused bleeding. The Prophet ~ came back
home silently. Abu Jahl came back too and sat among his friends
beside the Ka'bah. Hamzah bin Abdul-Muttalib was the uncle of the
Prophet ~ - He loved the Prophet ~ very much but was still a
disbeliever. He was in the practice of going to the wilderness every
morning with his bow and arrows and passing the whole day in
hunting and would return only in the evening and go home only after
circumambulating the Ka'bah. That fateful day when Hamzah was on

Prophet Muhammad Jli

117

his way back home from the chase, he came across the slave-woman
of Abdullah bin Jad'an who told him about Abu Jahl's abusing and
hitting the Prophet ~ with a stone and the latter's returning home in
perfect silence.
Hamzah besides being the uncle, was also the foster brother of the
Prophet ~- This relation of blood and milk sent his temper out of
control. He went straight to the Ka'bah, circumambulated it first and
then turned back to where Abu Jahl was sitting with his friends .
Hamzah was essentially a warrior, the bravest and the most
courageous amongst the Quraish. Going straight to Abu Jahl, Hamzah
proceeded to strike a bow upon his head causing him to bleed saying,
"Would you dare to insult and abuse him if I followed his religion
and say what he says?" Abu Jahl's friends got enraged and rose in his
support but Abu Jahl pacified them all saying it was he who had
crossed the limits. If Hamzah had not taken revenge on me for his
nephew, he would have been counted among those bereft of a sense
of honor. Abu Jahl was worried that Hamzah might come to the fold
of Islam in a fit of anger and antagonism.
When Hamzah returned to the Prophet ~ with the news of his taking
revenge of him, he remarked: "O uncle, this is not pleasing to me, I
would really be pleased if you come into the fold of Islam." Having
heard this, Hamzah embraced Islam then and there. The conversion of
Amir Hamzah ~ to Islam invigorated the weak band of believers.
This event occurred during the sixth year of the Prophethood. The
Quraish now had to be cautious in dealing with the Prophet ~ and his
Companions.

Umar bin Khattab's conversion to Islam
Umar bin Khattab's acceptance of Islam plunged the Quraish into
immense grief and their hostility took a serious turn. Umar bin
Khattab was, like Hamzah bin Abdul-Muttalib ~' a well-known
wrestler and one of the most famous brave men of Arabia. He played
a prominent role in targeting the Muslims because of their new faith.
He took hold of a Muslim and kept on thrashing him till he himself
became exhausted and resumed the beating after having to take a rest.
He tried his level best to bring the Muslims back to the old faith but

118

History of Islam

miserably failed in this endeavor. Being frustrated to the core he, one
day announced in a assembly of the disbelievers hi s plan to do away
with Muhammad~, the cause of the discord in Arabia.
Having heard about this heinous plan, Abu Jahl encouraged him by
offering one hundred camels and one thousand Uqiyah (about 125
kilograms) of silver if the task was accomplished. ln this state he came
out with unsheathed sword in his hand in search of Muhammad :l.
"Where are you going in this manner?" Sa'd bin Abu Waggas asked
Umar. "I am going to assassinate Muhammad today so that the
c,lamity that has overtaken the Makkans is not experienced
anymore." "Do you not fear the retaliation of Banu Hashim?" Sa'd bin
Abu Wagqas ~ pleaded with Umar bin Khattab. "So far as there is a
sword in my hand I fear none." Umar bin Khattab retorted and
added, "As you appear to be a staunch supporter of Muhammad, let
me kill you first." Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ replied, "Take care of
your own household first before killing Muhammad and me, for your
sister has already embraced Islam."
Hearing this sarcastic reply, Umar turned mad with rage and
proceeded straight towards the house of his sister. His turning
towards the house of his sister was, in fact, his turning to lslam.
Khabbab bin Al-Aratt ~ was then giving Fatimah ~ , the sister of
Umar bin Khattab and Saeed bin Zaid ~' her husband, lessons in the
Qur'an.
H,nring heard the footsteps, Khabbab ~ hid somewhere in th e house
along with the written pages of the Qur'an. "What were you all
reading?" Umar inquired in a fit of anger and grappled with his
brother-in-law beating him mercilessly. When his sister intervened to
save her husband, Umar hit her too making her bleed. Thereupon she
mustered courage enough to throw a challenge to Umar saying
"Umar; We have become Muslims and have been obeying
Muhammad ~, so do whatever you want."
On this courageous reply, Umar looked towards the bleeding face of
his sister and his heart was moved at the pathetic sight, with the
result that his furious storm subsided to a great extent. Umar then
asked his sister to show him what they were reading. Since Umar was

Prophet Muhammad #

119

talking sense, his sister dared to ask him to take a bath first before
touching the Scripture. Umar took a bath and then went through the
Words of Allah only to admit with fervor:
"What sweet words these are, I am feeling the impression on
my heart."
Having heard this, Khabbab ~ came out from his hiding and said,
"Congratulations, 0 Umar! The prayer of Muhammad ~ has been
accepted, for I have heard the Prophet ~ invoking Allah: 'O Allah!
Convert to Islam either Umar bin Khattab or Abu Jahl bin Hisham."'
Then Khabbab ~ read out the first Ruku' of Surat Ta-Ha. Umar upon
hearing the Verses of the Qur'an, started weeping emotionally. Following
this, Umar demanded from Khabbab ~ to take him to the Prophet ~ Umar still had the unsheathed sword in his hand but his purpose was
changed.
Umar knocked at the door of the house of Arqam. Since he had an
unsheathed sword in his hand, the Companions were reluctant to
open the door. But the Prophet ~ asked them to throw the door open.
Hamzah ~ encouraged them saying, "Let him in. If he has good
intentions it is better, otherwise he will be beheaded with his own
sword."
As Umar stepped in, the Prophet~ moved forward and said seizing
his cloak rather violently: "Will you not leave your path?" Omar
answered: "O Messenger of Allah! I have come to embrace Islam." As
the Prophet ~ heard this, he raised the cry of Allahu Akbar, and his
Companions joined him so loudly that it resounded through the hills
of Makkah.
Islam was immensely strengthened with Hamzah and Umar ~
marching to the path of Islam one after another. After converting to
Islam, Omar bin Khattab ~ proceeded straight to the house of Abu
Jahl and knocked at his door. He came out and fervently greeted
Umar bin Khattab ~ and said, "What for have you come?" Umar ~
replied, "By the grace of Allah, I have embraced Islam and I now
believe in Muhammad ~ as the Messenger of Allah." Hearing this
Abu Jahl shut his door in rage and went in. Umar ~ also came back.
He meant by it to break this news to the greatest enemy of Islam.

120

History of Islam

Umar bin Khattab ~ soon after believing in Allah and His
Messenger, suggested to the Prophet~: "We need not pray to Allah
secretly in houses, we should do it publicly at the Ka'bah." Umar bin
Khattab ~ fought back anyone who stood against it. Now the
Muslims made it a practice to perform their prayers at the Ka'bah and
Islam made its presence felt open and above board. This event took
place at the end of the last month of the sixth year of Prophethood.
Umar bin Khattab ~ was then 33 years of age. With his conversion to
Islam the number of Muslims in Makkah reached 40.

Social Boycott
Umar's coming to the fold of Islam plunged the Makkan disbelievers
into profound grief. The believers began to perform their prayers
openly at the Ka'bah, while a substantial number of the converts had
been in peace in Abyssinia. The Quraish were rendered helpless and
they had no way within their power to ward off the lurking menace.
Now they went into fresh consultr1tions and discussed wr1ys and
means to combat the challenge.
They came up with a plan to see Abu Talib and ask him to hand over
his nephew to them. In case of his refusal they decided to impose a
complete social and material boycott on Banu Hashim and Banu
Abdul-Muttalib, who were lending their unrelenting support to the
new faith. They reached an agreement that they would sever all
relations with these two tribes and none among them would meet the
Muslims, talk with them and establish marital relations with any of
them. Moreover, they decided to see that no food reached them from
any quarter. They also agreed that the boycott would be kept in force
until they handed over Muhammad ~ to them.
They put their agreement in writing with the initials of all the
notables of the Quraish and hung it on the Ka'bah, this gave added
impact to the agreement. Abu Talib, along with the Banu Hashim and
Banu Abdul-Muttalib, deserted their homes and went into the hills of
Makkah to stay there. All the Muslims followed them to the pass
called Shi'b Abu Talib. Abu Lahab was the only man of Banu Hashim
who sided with the disbelievers. The food that Banu Hashim brought
with them ran short and they had to live in a state of near starvation.

Prophet Muhammad jJj

121

Three years elapsed with untold sufferings forced upon the Muslims.
The inhuman persecution endured by them was awe-inspiring. These
besieged people would come out during the days of Hajj and would
buy food and other things they needed. The Prophet ~ would also
come out in the months of peace and in this atmosphere would preach
Islam among the people from outside Makkah. But the Quraish
followed him everywhere holding people back from listening to him
and branding him as insane and a sorcerer.
The three-year exile of the Muslims to Shi'b Abu Talib proves beyond
doubt that the sense of honor of the tribes and considerations for race
and lineage had substantial value and importance. It was this fact that
forced even the disbelieving section of Banu Hashim to extend their
unflinching support to the Prophet ~ - This miserable period of exile
spanning over three years also proved a blessing in disguise. They all
became very close to the Prophet ~ even the disbelieving group had a
real chance of observing the life and activities, conduct and character of
one who had nothing but the message of truth, love and righteousness.
They watched him directly and came into direct contact with his Divine
mission. Three years of inhuman treatment meted out to Banu Hashim
stirred some Quraish individuals from within.
The Quraish of Makkah could easily assess the pathetic situation
when the babies of Banu Hashim were heard crying in front of their
starving parents due to lack of food. Zuhair bin Abu Umayyah bin
Mughirah was the first to assess the gravity of the sufferings because
Abu Talib happened to be his maternal uncle. Zuhair drew first the
attention of Mut'im bin Adi bin Naufal bin Abdu Manaf on the
grounds of relationship to the miseries borne by Banu Hashim and
persuaded him to break the agreement. He then brought AbulBukhtari bin Hisham and Zam'ah bin Al-Aswad round to his plan. A
number of persons rose in favor of abrogating the agreement in view
of their close relations with Banu Hashim.
In the meantime, the Prophet ~ conveyed to Abu Talib that he was
informed by Allah the Almighty that the document bearing the
agreement had been eaten by the termites except the word "Allah"
where ever it was mentioned. Hearing this, Abu Talib came out of the
pass and informed the Quraish that Muhammad ~ had told him such

122

History of Islam

and such. He then asked them to see the document and in case it was
destroyed, the boycott should also be called off. The disbelievers were
dismayed when they found that termites had already eaten up the
document except the spots that mentioned the Name of Allah. They
were all deeply bewildered and announced the end of boycott then
and there.
Banu Hashim and all the Muslims came out from Shi'b Abu Talib
after three years and began to live in their deserted houses. They had
lived in Shi'b Abu Talib a life of acute depravation which forced them
at times to eat the leaves of trees. If they found a dry skin, they would
roast and eat it. Hakim bin Hizam would, sometimes, secretly send by
his slave some food to his father's sister Khadijah~. Once it came to
the notice of Abu Jahl, he snatched it from the slave and tightened his
vigil on them.

The Year of Sorrow
When the Prophet~ emerged from Shi'b Abu Talib, the tenth year of
Prophethood had started. Instead of showing politeness, the Quraish
appeared to be more atrocious. Moreover, some events also took place
in this year that it came to be called the Year of Sorrow among the
Muslims. During the month of Rajab, Abu Talib fell seriously ill and
died at the age of eighty. The death of Abu Talib was encouraging to
the hostile Makkans. Abu Talib was the only person who was held in
esteem and awe by one and all and with his death, the strength and
honor of Banu Hashim eroded to a great extent. It was a golden
opportunity for the mischievous Quraish to create trouble and
commit atrocities more openly and fearlessly.
The same year Abu Bakr~ also decided to migrate for the cruelties
of the Quraish had taken a turn beyond endurance. He had reached
Bark Al-Ghimad when he came across Ibn Daghinah, the chieftain of
the Qarah tribe. On being asked about his departure Abu Bakr 4;i> told
him that he had been tortured by his people to such an extent that he
was forced to leave Makkah to settle somewhere else so that he could
pray to Allah peacefully. Ibn Daghinah said, "You are a man that
neither yourself nor the people should let you go from Makkah. You
better come back and worship your Lord in Makkah." Thus Abu Bakr

Prophet Muhammad~

123

~ returned to Makkah.

lbn Daghinah assembled the notables of the
Quraish and put them to utter shame for driving out a man with such
high qualities. Abu Bakr ~ built in his courtyard a platform for
performing prayer where he began to recite the Qur'an and offer
prayers. His loud recitation would leave its impression on the hearts
and minds of the women and children of neighborhood. Obviou sly,
the Quraish could not remain silent over this lurking danger. Ibn
Daghinah forbade him but Abu Bakr ~k> boldly answered back, "T
abandon your protection now and go to the shelter of Allah the
Almighty instead of giving up the recitation of the Qur'an."
Two months after the demise of Abu Talib, Khadijah ~ the wife of
the Prophet :i also passed away in the tenth year of his Prophethood.
The Prophet~ loved her very much . She was his companion through
all his troubles and suffering. She was the first to believe in him. She
always encouraged him and consoled him to keep patience. Abu Talib
and Khadijah ~ were such staunch supports that their constant
encouragement kept the Prophet :i moving forward with his mission.
Their final departure made him sad. He was plunged into frustration
also because the atrocities of the disbelievers had taken a turn for the
worse.
Once he~ was passing through a place where some scoundrels threw
mud on his head with the result that his hair, body and garments
were polluted. He came back home in the same pitiable plight. His
daughter, Fatimah Zuhrah ~ washed him weeping bitterly.
Thereupon the Prophet ~ consoled her saying, "Weep not my
daughter! Allah the Almighty will Himself protect your father."
Once the Prophet ~ went to the Ka'bah where the polytheists were
sitting, Abu Jahl passed a sarcastic remark, "O Abd Manaf, look your
Prophet has come." Utbah bin Rabi'ah quipped, "Who are we to reject
if one claims to be a Prophet or an angel?" The Prophet~ turned to
Utbah and said, "You never lent support to the cause of Allah and His
Messenger and remained insolently persistent in your stand." While
addressing Abu Jahl he j/i remarked, "The time is drawing near when
you will laugh less and weep more." Then he told all the pagans, "The
time is nearing when you will enter into the faith you are rejecting
now."

124

History of Islam

The Journey to Ta'if
The stubbornness of Quraish continued to increase. During the very
period of Shi'b Abu Talib, the Prophet~ had started preaching Islam
among the people arriving in Makkah from outside during the Hajj
season. But these efforts did not bear fruit. He decided to call the
people of Ta'if to Islam. Ta'if is at a distance of 60 miles from Makkah
and was as a big city as Makkah. It was inhabited by Banu Thaqif who
worshipped Lat. In Ta'if there was a temple of Lat, which was the
center of attraction for the whole of the city. In the month of Shawwal,
the 10th year of Prophethood, one month after the death of Khadijah
~, the Prophet~ took Zaid bin Harithah and left for Ta'if on foot.
In route to Ta'if he first contacted the Banu Bakr tribe. When they too
behaved like the Makkans, he went to the Qahtan people but they
were also similar to the Quraish. At last he~ reached Ta'if and made
his first contacts with men of status. Among the chieftains of Ta'if,
Abd Yalil bin Amr bin Umair and his two brothers, Mas'ud and
Habib were the most influential. The Prophet ~ met all three and
invited them to Islam. They were very haughty. One of them retorted:
"Had God made you His Prophet you would not have been walking
about like this." Another one quipped: "Did God find none to send as
Prophet other than you?"
"And they said: why is not this Qur'an sent down to some great
man of the two towns." (43:31)
The third one pleaded: "I don't like to have a talk with you, for if you are
true to your word in being the Messenger of God, it is risky to reject it; if
you are lying about God, you are not fit to be talked with."

Obstinate Behavior of the People of Ta'if:
When the Prophet ~ met with failure in the case of Abd Yalil and his
brothers, he ~ asked them to keep what came to pass between them a
secret. He then left to contact others but Abd Yalil and his brothers stirred
up their slaves and some rabble of the town to harass the Prophet ~ -The
riffraff of Ta'if followed the Prophet :!Ji§;, abusing, screaming, and throwing
stones at him until he left Ta'if but they kept following him. When the

Prophet Muhammad ;iii

125

shower of stones hit his shins, they bleed profusely. At a distance of three
miles from Ta'if, there was an orchard of Ut.bah bin Rabi'ah, a wealthy
man of Makkah. The Prophet~ took refuge in it. Sitting under the shade
of a wall he invoked Allah the Almighty saying, "O Allah! You are the
Protector and Caretaker of the weak and the helpless and I seek Your
help alone."
Utbah bin Rabi'ah was present in his orchard at that time. Arabian
nobility and the sense of hospitality pressed him to send through his
slave Addas a bunch of grapes on a plate. The slave was a Christian
from Nainua (Nineveh) . The Prophet ~ ate from the grapes and invited
Addas to accept Islam. He was impressed and kissed the Prophet's
hands. Utbah was watching all this. When Addas returned, Utbah said
to him, "Accept not what he says, for his religion was better than that
of his (Prophet's)." The Prophet~ took a rest in the orchard for a while
and then left. From there he arrived at Nakhlah and passed his night in
a date grove. Some of the leaders of the jinn heard him recite the
Qur' an and believed in him.

Back to Makkah:
On his return, the Prophet~ came up to the mount of Hira and sent
his message to the chieftains of the Quraish but none showed his
readiness to give him refuge. When his message came to Mut'im bin
Adi, inspite of being a polytheist, he got up overwhelmed with the
sense of national honor and came to the mount of Hira. He took the
Prophet j/s with him and they went to Makkah. The sons of Mut'im
stood in front of the Ka'bah with unsheathed swords. In this way the
Prophet j/s went around the Ka'bah. Thereafter, Mut'im and his sons
accompanied him to his house under the shadow of their swords.
"What's your relation with Muhammad?" the Quraish asked Mut'im.
He replied, "I have no relation with Muhammad. I am simply his
supporter, and nobody can dare look at him with evil eyes while he
enjoys my support." Such staunch support from Mut'im silenced the
Quraish. As per one narrative, an angel came to the Prophet~ in Ta'if
and said, "If you order me I would join together the two hills between
which Ta'if is located." But he j/s replied, "No, if they fail to accept
Islam, their progeny will do it."

Marriage with I Aishah ~, and Ni'rl/
The same year in Shawwal, the 10th year of Prophethood, the Prophet
~ married Saudah bint Zam'ah ~ and Aishah bint Abu Bakr~' and
he was also honored with the Mi'raj (the Night Journey and his
: Ascension to the heavens). Scholars are in disagreement regarding the
year of the Ascension and some of them are of the opinion that it took
place more than once. But this is not the place to discuss the issue in
great detail.

Preaching Islam in Different Places and Tribes
Being fed up with the Makkans, the Prophet ~ undertook a journey to
Ta'if but they proved worse than the Makkans. The Makkans ill
treatment of the Muslims was multiplying day by day. But he~ did
not lose his courage or determination. Back from Ta'if he resumed his
duty of preaching to the tribes which stayed around Makkah during
the Hajj days.
He contacted Banu Kindah and Banu Abdullah tribes at their
dwellings. To Banu Abdullah he said, "O Banu Abdullah! Your father
was Abdullah (literally the slave of Allah)! You too should become the
slaves of Allah". He ~ also went to the settlement of Banu Hanifah
tribe but they meted out treatment worst than ever.
He ~ continued preaching Islam among the caravans from outside
Makkah during the Hajj season. But Abu Lahab was very keen on
interrupting the preaching mission and calling the people not to pay
heed to what the Prophet ~ would say. He ~ invited Banu Amir,
Banu Shaiban, Banu Kalb, Banu Muharib, Fazarah, Ghassan, Sulaim,
Abs, Harith, Adhrah, Dhuhl, and Murrah tribes to accept Islam.
On contacting Banu Amir, a man named Firas said, "In case we accept
Islam and you attain power, will you then appoint me your successor
after you?" The Prophet~ replied, "This is within the Power of Allah
the Almighty Alone that He choose somebody to succeed me."
Hearing this he said, "Wonderful! At present we lay down our lives
for your mission, and upon your big victories others plunge in to
enjoy the fruits of power! Go away, I want nothing to do with you."

History of Islam

Suwaid bin Samit
During the 11th year of Prophethood, from the tribe of Aus, a man
named Suw aid bin Samit from Al-Madinah came across the Prophet
~ and the latter invited him to accept Islam. H e said, "You perhaps,
have something which I too have with me." The Prophet ~ said,
"What do you possess at all?" He replied, "The Wisdom of Luqman. "
He ~ said, "Let me know it." He recited some verses and the Prophet
~ appreciated it as a good sa ying, "But I have the Glorious Qur'an,
which is fa r better in virtue and excellence and it is perfect in light
and guidance. " He then recited a few Verses from the Qur'an. He
readily admitted that it was certainly the epitome of light and guidance.
As per some narratives, he embraced Islam whil e others deny it.
However, he held himself back from opposing the Prophet ~ from that
day on. H e went back to Al-Madinah and was killed in a battle fought
betw een the Aus and the Kha zraj tribes.

lyas bin Mu 1 adh ~
During these days Anas bin Rafi', accompanied by some p ersons of
his tribe Banu Abdul-Ashhal, came to Makkah to strike an agreement
with the Quraish against the Khaz raj. As the Prophet ~ came to know
of his arrival, he quickly w ent to him before he was abl e to meet.the
chieftains of the Quraish to tell him about the issue in vi ew . He ~ at
once said to them, "I have something with me that is very beneficial for
you all; I can let you know it if you so desire." They said in one voice,
"Very well, tell us w hat it is all about." Thereupon he~ said, "I have
been sent as the Messenger of Allah for the guidance of the people. I
forbid one and all to practice polytheism and ask you to worship Allah
Alone. Allah has sent down His Book to me." Following this he taught
them a few basic tenets of Islam and read out some Verses from the
Glorious Qur'an. Iyas bin Mu'adh, a young fellow in the delegation of
Anas bin Rafi ' listened to the Prophet ~ and his recitation from the
Qur'a n with rapt attention, and impatiently said, "O my people! This is
far better than that for which you have come from Al-Madinah." Anas
bin Rafi', the leader of the delegation rebuked Iyas bin Mu'adh and said,
"We have not come here for this." lyas kept quiet, and the Prophet ~ left ·

the place silently. The delegation from Al-Madinah also met with utter
failure and no agreement with the Quraish could be finalized. A few days
after reaching Al-Madinah, Iyas bin Mu'adh passed away declaring his
faith in Islam.

Dimad Azdi
Dimad Azdi was a noted sorcerer and citizen of Yemen. Once he came
to Makkah and came to know from Quraish that Muhammad :i was
possessed by jinn. He claimed that he would cure him through his
incantation. Then he came to the Prophet~ and said, "I want to recite
my incantation for you." Thereupon he~ said, "Take from me first
and you will recite afterwards." Then he~ recited the following:
"Verily all praise is for Allah, we praise Him and we seek His help.
Whomsoever Allah guides, none can misguide; and whomsoever
Allah misguides, none can guide. I bear witness that none has the
right to be worshipped except Allah Alone, having no partner; and
I bear witness that Muhammad is his slave and His Messenger.
Then after, ... "
He ~ had uttered this much that Dimad lost control over himself and
exclaimed, "Repeat these words." He made the Prophet ~ repeat these
words several times before he said, "I have heard from soothsayers,
sorcerers and poets their words but such words of such a comprehensive
and exhaustive nature I have never come across." Saying this he
entreated the Prophet ~ ' "Please stretch out your hand, I embrace Islam
right now."

Tufail bin Amr Dausi ~
The Daus tribe belonged to Yemen and its chief Tufail bin Amr was
reckoned among the richest men of Yemen. Besides being an
intellectual he was also a great poet. The same year, the 11th year of
Prophethood, he came to Makkah. The chieftains of Makkah came out
to greet him and brought him into Makkah with high honors. The
Quraish were, however, anxious about his possible meeting with the
Prophet ~ and his being charmed by the latter. Thus, with the entry
of Tufail to the town, they told him that there was a sorcerer in the

130

History of Islam

town who had brought calamities to the people and separated father
from son, son from father, brother from brother and husband from
wife. So, he must be careful against any word of his coming to his
(Tufail' s) ears.

One early morning, Tufail reached the Ka'bah with his ears stuffed
with cotton. The Prophet ::I was then offering the Fajr (Dawn) prayer.
The way of offering the prayer charmed Tufail and he gradually drew
nearer. He happened to hear something from the Prophet's recitation
of the Qur'an. Tufail relates: "I thought, I am also a poet and a wise
person and nothing in a speech can elude me. If it is good, I shall ;
accept it; if bad, I shall reject it. With this thought I threw out the
pieces of cotton from my ears." Tufail then followed the Prophet ~ up
to his dwelling and asked him to let him know what he kept saying.
The Prophet ~ read out some Verses from the Qur'an and Tufail
embraced Islam then and there. He then entreated the Prophet:
"Invoke Allah to favor my whole tribe with Islam through me." Tufail
~ came home and embarked on his mission of inviting his people to
accept Islam. He also requested the Prophet~ to accompany him and
escape the torture of the Makkans. The Prophet ~ replied, "I shall
migrate on the Order of Allah the Almighty and to the place enjoined
by Him."

Abu Dhar Ghifari ~
Abu Dhar Ghifari belonged to Banu Ghifar and lived in the suburbs of
Al-Madinah. News about the Messenger ~ reached Al-Madinah
through Suwaid bin Samit and lyas bin Mu 'adh, and when Abu Dhar
Ghifari overheard it he sent his brother Unais, who was also a poet, to
find out the facts. Unais met the Prophet ~ and reported to Abu Dhar
Ghifari in Al-Madinah that he came across such a person who taught
to follow the good and shun the evil. Abu Dhar was not satisfied with
this much. So, he left Al-Madinah for Makkah on foot and embraced
Islam after presenting himself to the Prophet ~ - From there he went
straight to the Ka'bah and recited the word of Touhid and some Verses
of the Qur'an at the top of his voice, with the result that he was
surrounded by the Quraish on all sides and beaten to
un consciousn ess. Thev were about to kill him. when Abbas, who ._,.,a:,

j Prophet Muhammad ;}ff

131

j still a disbeliever, passed by. He revealed that the victim was a man

Ifrom the Ghifar tribe where they brought dates for trading. Hearing
1

this they left him. The next day, Abu Dhar~ raised again the word
of Tauhid loudly and was again beaten mercilessly. Later on he
returned back to Al-Madinah.

Six Fortunate Souls of Yathrib
It was the last month of the 11th year of Prophethood and the bloody
battle between Aus and Khazraj had come to an end after taking a heavy
toll of noted chiefs from both sides. Caravans from outside had begun
to come into Makkah to perform the Hajj rites, and the Prophet ~ had
started contacting people and preaching Islam among them at their
places. Abu Jahl and Abu Lahab followed the Prophet~ forbidding
people to give their ears to what he had to say. He, in order to be safe
from their mischief, would come out in the darkness of night to
contact the caravans staying at a distance of several miles from the
Kabah.
Once, at a distance of few miles from Makkah, he heard some people
talking during night at Aqabah. He came close and saw that they
were six in all wh o had come from Yathrib to perform the Hajj and
that they were all from Khazraj. The Prophet~ preached Islam and
read out a few Verses from the Qur'an. They listened with rapt
attention; they looked at each other and embraced Islam on the spot.
The entire population of Yathrib was divided between the Jews and
the idolaters. The Aus and the Khazraj were the two well-known and
mighty tribes of the idolaters and they continually heard from the Jews
about the rising of a grand Prophet in the immediate future, and also
about his dominance over all others. Since they had already heard
about it, they lost no time in accepting Islam.
Those six persons were Abu Umamah As'ad bin Zurarah (who was
from Banu Najjar and a relative of the Prophet 01, and was the first to
embrace Islam), Auf bin Harith, Rafi' bin Malik, Qutbah bin Amir,
Jabir bin Abdullah, Uqbah bin Amir bin Nabi $,. The Prophet ~ gave
Rafi bin Malik ~ in written form the portion from the Qur'an already
revealed. The small band of believers left for Al-Madinah with the

132

History of Islam

sincere promise to preach Islam among their people. They set to
translate their promise into action immediately after reaching AlMadinah and Al-Madinah heard the echo of Islam everywhere.

First Pledge of Aqabah
The 12th year of Prophethood had set in. The Quraish were still
adamant in their hostility. This whole year passed in a mixed state of
hope and fear for the Prophet ~ as he did not know about the
missionary activities of the six persons who had gone back to AlMadinah with the promise of preaching Islam among their people. At
last, the Prophet ~ went to the same place of Aqabah during the next
Hajj season in search of those persons who had taken the pledge to
preach Islam in Al-Madinah the previous year.
All of a sudden, he noticed them along with some new faces
belonging both to the Aus and the Khazraj. Those twelve persons
were: Abu Umamah, Auf bin Harith bin Rifa'ah, Rafi bin Malik bin
Al-Ajlan, Qutbah bin Amir bin Hadbah and Uqbah bin Amir $,.
These five persons belonged to the group, which had accepted Islam
the previous year. The other seven persons were: Mu'adh bin Hariththe brother of Auf bin Harith, Dhakwan bin Abd Qais bin Khalid,
Khalid bin Mukhallad bin Amir bin Zuraiq, Ubadah bin Samit bin
Qais (from Junaib tribe), Abbas bin Ubadah bin Nadlah <$,. These ten
persons were from the Khazraj tribe, Abul-Haitham bin At-Taihan ~
(from Banu Abdul-Ashhal) and Uwaim bin Sa'idah ~' the last two
were from the Aus tribe.
These twelve persons pledged their allegiance to Islam at the hand of
the Prophet ~- While departing they requested the Prophet ~ to
dispatch along with them a preacher, and Mus'ab bin Umair ~ was
made in charge of the mission. He arrived at Al-Madinah and stayed
at the house of As'ad bin Zurarah ~ and made it his preaching
center. During the first pledge of Aqabah, the Prophet ;i had asked
them to confess the following:
1) We shall worship one God associating none with Him.
2) We shall not go near stealing and adultery.
3) We shall not kill our daughters.

Prophet Muhammad Ji

133

4) We shall vilify none.
5) We shall not backbite
6) We shall obey the Prophet~ in every thing good.

Success of Mus'ab bin Umair •

in AI-Madinah

Mus'ab bin Umair ~ devoted his all-out efforts to preaching Islam in
Al-Madinah. By the Grace of Allah, tribe after tribe in Al-Madinah
came into the fold of Islam. From the branches of the Aus in AlMadinah, Banu Abdul-Ashhal and Banu Zafar clans were very
renowned and strong. Sa'd bin Mu'adh was, besides being the
chieftain of Banu Abdul-Ashhal, the commander of all the clans.
Usaid bin Hudhair was the chieftain of Banu Zafar clan. His father
was the commander of all the clans in the battle of Bu'ath and was
killed in the same battle. As'ad bin Zurarah • in whose house
Mus'ab bin Umair •
was staying was the cousin of Sa'd bin
Mu'adh.Once Mus'ab bin Umair •
was sitting by the well of Banu
Abdul-Ashhal and was in conversation with As'ad bin Zurarah • ·
Sa'd bin Mu'adh did not like their preaching of Islam in his locality.
Sa'd called Usaid bin Hudhair and asked him to tell them in strong
words not to come into their locality from then on. Usaid moved
towards them with his sword and reproached both As'ad and Mus'ab
~. "There is no harm if you please sit down and listen to what I say;
you are at liberty to decide after that." Usaid sat down saying, "Very
well." Mus'ab then expounded Islam to him and recited the Qur'an.
Usaid kept listening silently. When Mus'ab bin Umair finished, Usaid
bin Hudhair said, "I accept Islam." Usaid • then said, "There is one
man that if he becomes a Muslim, there would be none to oppose
l you." I'll send him to you at once. "Thus Usaid • came back to Sa'd
l bin Mu'adh who was waiting for Usaid • · "What did you say to
them?" Sa'd inquired. Usaid ~ said, "They have promised not to do
j anything against your will. But a new incident took place there. A few
young men of Banu Harithah came in and they wanted to kill As'ad
bin Zurarah." Hearing this Sa'd bin Mu'adh stood up with his sword
and reached the spot. He saw both As'ad and Mus'ab ~ sitting there
peacefully. Sa'd fell in doubt about his being sent to them under false
pretenses. With this thought entering his mind he began to abuse

l

134

History of Islam

them and told As'ad ~ that he had considerations for relations
otherwise he could not have dared come to the locality to preach Islam.
Mus'ab ~ said, "Please sit down and accept what 1 say or reject it
outright."Sa'd laid down his sword and sat before them. Mus'ab ~
told him what he had already stated before to Usaid ~ and Sa'd too
embraced Islam then and there. On return he assembled the people of
his clan and said, "What's your opinion about me?" They said as one
man, "You are our chief and your opinion has always been worth
practicing." Thereupon Sa'd ~ said, "I have nothing to do with you
unless you all accept Islam." Having heard this, the entire Banu
Abdul-Ashhal accepted Islam.
Thus Islam kept spreading among other tribes and clans of AlMadinah. It was the 13th year of Prophethood. On one hand, Mus'ab
bin Umair 4Wk, was achieving successes one after another and the
tortures of Quraish were crossing all limits on the other. In DhulHijjah, in the 13th year of Prophethood, Mus'ab bin Umair ~ set out
to Makkah with a caravan of 72 men and 2 women of Al-Madinah.
They were sent with the twin purpose of seeing the Prophet~ and to
invite him to come to Al-Madinah.

Second Pledge of Aqabah
The Prophet ~ had already been informed of the arrival of this caravan.
He came out in the night, took his uncle Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib with
him and reached the mountain pass of Aqabah. The caravan of believers
from Al-Madinah was waiting for him. The caravan also had comprised
some disbelievers with it as well. The polytheists from Al-Madinah were
unaware of that fateful meeting and they were sleeping in their
dwellings. When the people of Al-Madinah expressed their desire to take
the Prophet~ to Al-Madinah, Abbas rose to say:
"O the people of Al-Madinah: Muhammad ~ is at present
under the protection of his family. Since you want to take him
with you, keep in mind, you are alone responsible for his safety
and security. But his protection is not easy. Take him with you
if you are ready for a series of bloody fights, otherwise abandon
such a yearning right now."

Prophet Muhammad j/j

135

· Bara' bin Ma'rur ~ rose to answer and said, "Abbas! we listened to
what you said. Now we want the Prophet~ also to say something."
Thereupon he ~ recited some Verses of the Qur' an and the:'1 brought
home the rights of Allah and His slaves and the responsibilities to be
thrust upon them on taking him to Al-Madinah. Having heard the
speech of the Prophet ~, Bara' bin Ma 'rur ~ said, "We are prepared
for all eventualities." Follow ing this, Abul-Haitham bin Taihan ~
said, "You please promise tha t you will not come back leaving us in
Al-Madinah." The Prophet ~ said, " I shall live and die with you." At
this, Abdullah bin Rawahah ~said, " 0 Prophet of Allah! What shall
we get in return?" The Prophet~ replied, "Hea ven and the pleasure
of Allah!" Abdullah ~ said, "Now the bargain is settled . There will
be no going back on both sides." In the wake of this, all of them took
the oath of allegiance and Bara' bin Ma'rur ~ was first. This is called
the Second Pledge of Aqabah. After the agreement wa s finalized,
As'ad bin Zurarah ~ said addressing everyone, "O people! Bear in
mind this mutual agreement implies that we are prepared to face the
entire world." All of them said, "Yes, we know very well that we will
have to confront the entire world." At the end, the Prophet ~ chose
twelve persons from among them and appointed them his
proclaimers with the duty of preaching Islam. The twelve are listed
below:
(1) As'ad bin Zurarah, (2) Usaid bin Hudair, (3) Abul-Haitham bin Al-

Taihan, (4) Bara ' bin Ma'rur, (5) Abdullah bin Rawahah, (6) Ubad ah
bin Samit, (7) Sa 'd bin Rabi ', (8) Sa'd bin Ubadah, (9) Rafi ' bin Malik,
(10) Abdullah bin Amr, (11) Sa'd bin Kaithamah, and (12) Mundhir
bin Amr ;~.
Among these twelve chieftains, nine belonged to the Khazraj tribe and
three to the Aus. Addressing them, the Prophet ~ said, "Like the
partisans of Jesus ~ I, I assign you the responsibilities of educating
your people and I hold resp onsibility for you all." A t the time the
pledge of Aqabah was taking its final fo rm, a satan from the top of the
mountain cried loudly: "O Makkans! Behold , Muhammad and his
party are holding consultati ons against you." He and his party of
believers paid no heed to this call. When everything was finalized , the
Prophet ~ left the issue of migrating to Al-Madin ah to the permission

136

History of Islam

from Allah the Almighty. Thereafter, they left the place in ones and
twos so that secrecy could be maintained. The Prophet~ and Abbas
bin Abdul-Muttalib came to Makkah but the very next morning the
Quraish were informed of the meeting that took place the night
before. They hurried to the residence of the people from Al-Madinah
and said, "Did Muhammad visit you last night?" The non-Muslims or
idolaters among them were themselves unaware of such an assembly
that was held the previous night.
Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was one of them who later on became the
head of the hypocrites, he retorted, "How can it be that the people of
Al-Madinah finalized any deal without my knowledge?" Thus the
doubt in the mind of the Quraish was dispelled and they left. The
same moment the people from Al-Madinah started preparations for
their return journey and left for their destination. The Quraish came to
know of the event later through some other sources and they came
out again armed with their weapons. But, by then, the caravan had
already traveled a long distance.
Sa'd bin Ubadah and Mundhir bin Amr ~ were left behind for
certain reasons. Mundhir ~ fled away but Sa'd bin Ubadah ~ was
captured by the Quraish and they took him to Makkah beating him
mercilessly. Sa'd bin Ubadah ~ relates, "When the Quraish were
thrashing me relentlessly, a red and white complexioned man
appeared corning towards me and I thought he was the man among
the whole lot to treat me gracefully. But he slapped me violently
dispelling my hope of any good from those people. Meanwhile,
another person came on the scene and said, 'Are you acquainted with
anyone from the Quraish?' I replied, 'I know Jubair bin Mut'im and
Harith bin Umayyah, the grandsons of Abd Manaf.' He said, 'Why
don't you call them by their names?' Telling me this much he left to
contact those two persons and said to them, 'A man from Khazraj
tribe is being beaten and he is calling you for help.' They said, 'What's
his name?' He said, 'Sa'd bin Ubadah.' They said, 'We are obliged to
him, for we go to him with business and stay under his protection.'
Thus both of them came and got me out of their clutches. Soon after
being set free, I left for Al-Madinah (Yathrib)." A long time before the
Prophet ~ was told by Allah the Almighty that he would have to

Prophet Muhammad ii!

137

emigrate. He was shown in a dream where he was destined to go. He
had dreamt that it was a land of date palm trees. The dream led him
to think it might be Yamamah, for it too had a large number of date
trees.

General Permission to migrate to AI-Madinah
After the second pledge of Aqabah, the persecution of the Quraish
knew no bounds. Their hostility can be gauged from the following
single event. When the Prophet~' at the height of the atrocities, gave
the Muslims general permission to migrate from Makkah to AlMadinah in order to save their lives, they set out towards Al-Madinah
deserting their houses and leaving their relatives, the Quraish could
not put up with this provocative development. They began to put up
obstructions of many kinds in the way of the migrating Muslims so
that they could not live in peace and worship one God in Al-Madinah.
Umm Salamah ~ relates: "When Abu Salamah had made up his mind to
set out to Al-Madinah he saddled his camel and mounted me on it with
my son Salamah. Then taking hold of the camel's halter, he went ahead.
When some of the men belonging to our clan saw him, they came near us
saying, 'It is all right so far as you are concerned, but how can we allow
our daughter to go with you.' Meanwhile the clansmen of Abu Salamah
came in and said, 'If she does not go, we will not let our son go with her.'
Thus Banu Abdul-Asad took my child away." And Banu Mughirah
returned with Umm Salamah ~, with the result that Abu Salamah ~
was left alone for Al-Madinah. Umm Salamah ~ was separated from her
husband and son, while Abu Salamah ~ received the recompense for
migrating without his wife and son.
When Suhaib ~ tried to leave for Al-Madinah, the disbelieving
Quraish said to him, "You came to us as a destitute beggar and have
grown rich among us, and now you want to go away safely with your
life and wealth." So they snatched all his possessions and allowed him
to leave for Al-Madinah. When Hisham bin As~ decided to migrate,
the disbelievers caught and put him in captivity and tortured him.
Aiyash ~ migrated to Al-Madinah but Abu Jahl followed him and
deceitfully brought him back to Makkah and made him a captive.

138

History of Islam

In short, despite these impediments, the believers kept migrating to
Al-Madinah one or two at a time. All these migrants were the guests
of the Muslims in Al-Madinah. Migrating Muslims were called the
Muhajirin and their helpers in Al-Madinah were known as the Ansar.
The 14th year of Prophethood had started. Muhammad~' Abu Bakr
Siddiq ~ and Ali bin Abu Talib ~ and their wives and children
were yet to migrate, along with some others who were weak and old
people. Besides these few, all the Muslims had already migrated to
Al-Madinah and their houses were lying vacant. The Prophet * had not
made up his mind, for he was awaiting permission from Allah the
Almighty. He also held back Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ to accompany him to
Al-Madinah. Ali bin Abu Talib ~ was also delaying his migration
waiting for permission from the Prophet ~ -

Holding Counsel by the Quraish in Dar An-Nadwah
When the Quraish noticed that, one by one, all the Muslims slipped
out of their hands and they had gone to Al-Madinah in substantial
numbers, the Makkans felt it posed a danger to them and they grew
anxious about the future. Since the Prophet* was now living almost
alone, after the departure of his Companions, the Quraish targeted the
very existence of the preacher of Islam. They were now in a haste to
implement their plan, for with the departure of the Prophet ~ ' the
matter would get out of their control. They were all thinking in the
same direction until every tribe of Makkah was occupied with the
same common thought of putting the Prophet ~ to death. Thus, at the
end of the month of Safar, the 14th year of Prophethood, the chiefs of
all the tribes except Banu Hashim assembled in Dar An-Nadwah to
deliberate upon the issue. The chieftains of the Quraish who took part
in the deliberation were:
Abu Jahl bin Hisham (from Banu Makhzum), Nabih and Munabbehsons of Hajjaj (from Banu Sahm tribe), Umayyah bin Khalaf (from
Banu Jumh), Abul-Baukhtari bin Hisham, Zam'ah bin Aswad and
Hakim bin Hizam (from Banu Asad tribe), Nadr bin Harith (from
Banu Abdud-Dar tribe), Utbah and Shaibah-sons of Rabi'ah, Abu
Sufyan bin Harb (from Banu Umayyah tribe), Tuaimah bin Adi, Jubair
bin Mut'irn, Harith bin Amir (from Banu Naufal tribe). Besides these

Prophet Muhammad Ji

139

' famous names, there were many other chieftains. One of the
participants was a very old and experienced devil from the Najd and
was the president of the session. There was no disagreement among
the participants over the fact that Muhammad ~ was the source and
center of all their problems . But they had a disagreement over how he
should be dealt with.
One of them suggested: "Let him be put in fetters so that he dies of
hunger cind thirst." Thereupon the Sheikh of the Najd interrupted and
said, "This is not a good proposal for his relatives and followers will
try to seek his freedom which may result in violence and heavy
bloodshed." Another person proposed : "Let him be driven out from
Makkah with no permission for his re-entry." This suggestion was
also contradicted by the Sheikh of the Najd. Many other suggestions
were put forward and were rejected by him.
Lastly, Abu Jahl proposed: "Let a swordsman from each tribe be
chosen, and all of them should surround Muhammad ~ on all sides
and strike at him simultaneously so that his blood will be divided
among all the tribes and clans. Moreover, Banu Hashim will not be
able to face the collective force of the entire Quraish tribes. Ultimately
they will become content with the blood money, which may be
collected easily from the tribes involved in the action." This proposal
of Abu Jahl was highly appreciated by the Sheikh of the Najd and the
resolution was unanimously passed. The consultations were going on
in Dar An-Nadwah and at the same time Allah the Almighty
informed the l'rophet ~ with all that was taking place. Moreover,
permission for his migration was also granted.

Making Preparations for the Journey
With the order for migration, the Prophet ~ called at the house of
Abu Bakr ~~ at noon when the burning sun had forced the people
indoors. Since it was an unasual time to visit, Abu Bakr ~ speculated
that migration must have been ordered. First of all he ~ inquired if
there was any strange person in the house. When he was informed
that there was no one in the house except Abu Bakr ~ and his
daughters, Asma' and Aishah ~, he disclosed that migration to AlMadinah had been ordered.

140

History of Islam

"Who will accompany you on the journey?" Abu Bakr ~ asked. The
Prophet ;'Ji#; said, "You will accompany me." Having heard this, tears
of joy trickled down from the eyes of Abu Bakr ~ and he said, "O
Prophet of Allah! I have already bought two she-camels for this
purpose and have made them strong and stout, and I offer you one."
The Prophet ;'Ji#; said, "I will purchase it." Thus he paid for it and Abu
Bakr ~ had to accept it. And from that moment, preparations for
migration started. Asma' bint Abu Bakr ~ made them provisions of
parched barley and some other food, Aishah ~ was at that time still
of a very tender age. After telling Abu Bakr ~ of the plan, the
Prophet ;'Ji#; went back home.
The polytheists had made their nefarious plan to assassinate the
Prophet ;'Ji#; on the following night. They surrounded his house from
that evening. Their heinous plan was to make a surprise attack on the
Prophet ;'Ji#; when he comes out to offer his dawn prayers. The Prophet
;'Ji#; had asked Ali bin Abu Talib ~ to lie in his bed and to wrap
himself in his mantle. He also gave Ali ~ the valuables that his
pagan neighbors had left with him in trust, and instructed Ali ~ to
give them back to their rightful owners the next morning. He also
asked Ali ~ to migrate after settling these matters. After completing
this, the Prophet ;'Ji#; came out of his house in the dark hours of the
night reciting the first nine Verses of Surat Yasin. He threw a handful
of dust at them, with the result that they did not see him.
"And (remember) when disbelievers plotted against you to
imprison you or to kill you or to get out you; they were plotting
and Allah too was planing; and Allah is the Best of the
planners." (8:30)
Abu Bakr ~ paid Abdullah bin Uraiqit a reasonable sum to deliver
both the she-camels at an appointed time and place to be told to him
later, although he was a disbeliever, he was trustworthy.
The Prophet ;'Ji#; came out of his house and went straight to Abu Bakr ~They set out right away, and took a low-lying trail to a distance of four
miles outside of Makkah. They arrived at the cave of Mount Thaur and
hid themselves in it. Ali bin Abu Talib ~ kept sleeping soundly and
peacefully in the bed of the Prophet ;'Ji#; while the disbelievers of Makkah

Prophet Muhammad JI!

141

continued their siege around the house the whole night. They were
feeling satisfied thinking that Ali~ was the Prophet~- When Ali~ got
up for the Fajr (dawn) prayer the disbelievers asked him, "Where's
Muhammad?" Ali ~ retorted, "How can I know, for I was asleep the
whole night. You should know his whereabouts since you have been on
guard." The disbelievers held Ali ~ and beat him in a state of ferocity
and then released him after sometime. Ali~ then gave back the trusts to
their rightful owners.

It is worth noticing here that although the disbelievers were thirsting
for the life of the Prophet ~ , they trusted his honesty and integrity so
much so that they left their precious valuables, gold, silver, and
jewelry in trust with him. He ~ was very particular about it and that
is why he left Ali ~, someone he knew he could depend on, to return
the trusts to his bloodthirsty enemies.
Leaving Ali ~ , the disbelievers called at the house of Abu Bakr ~
and knocked at the door. Asma' bint Abu Bakr ~ came out. Abu Jahl
said, "O girl! Where is your father?" She said flatly, "I know nothing
about him." Hearing this the wicked man slapped her so violently
that her earrings fell down on the ground. After this, the furious
disbelievers mounted a search for the Prophet ~ but it was in vain.
Now, in a state of frustration, they announced a reward of one
hundred camels for anyone who could catch and bring back
Muhammad ~ dead or alive. The greed for such a substantial reward
incited a number of persons to search the area but their efforts met
with total failure.

The Sun and the Moon in the Cave of Mount Thaur
When the two arrived at the cave in Mount Thaur Abu Bakr ~
requested the Prophet ~ to wait until he searched and cleaned up the
cave. So he went in, searched it and stuffed the holes with the pieces
of cloth torn from his garment and then came out to escort the
Prophet ~ in. They remained hidden in the cave for three days and
nights. Some chieftains and notables from the Quraish reached the
mouth of the cave tracking their footprints. Since there was no trace
beyond this, some of them suggested that either Muhammad~ was
hidden somewhere there or might be inside the cave or had flown to

History of Islam

142

heaven from the same spot. Someone said, "No human has entered
this dark cave, it is in an undisturbed state for a long time." Another
person noticed, "There is a spider's web across the mouth of the cave
and anybody going in would have broken it." The third one pointed
to a pigeon flying around and the eggs, which it was hatching. So, all
of them grew confident that no human had entered the cave.
These disbelievers had come so close to the entrance that both the
Prophet
and Abu Bakr ~ . saw their feet and heard the voices of
these bloodthirsty warriors of the Quraish. In such a critical moment
Abu Bakr ~ said, "The disbelievers have at last arrived." The
Prophet js very confidently said, "Grieve not, Allah is with us," and
then added, "What do you think of those two with whom the third is
Allah?" The unfortunate disbelievers went back dismayed and
disappointed.

*

Abu Bakr ~ had already told his son Abdullah bin Abu Bakr ·. :;, to
keep him informed of the daily activities of the disbelievers of Makkah
at night. Similarly, he had instructed his slave, Amir bin Fuhairah to
graze his herd of goats anywhere but bring them to the cave of Thaur
at night. Asma' bint Abu Bakr ~~ was assigned the duty of bringing
meals to the Prophet ~ and Abu Bakr ~ in the night with the utmost
care. The brother and sister, Abdullah and Asma' ~ ' returned after
performing their duties, Amir bin Fuhairah also did his job and his
return in the late hours of the night by the way of Mount Thaur hid the
tracks made by the others. When the fervor of the disbelievers
subsided, Abdullah bin Uraiqit was told to bring the she-camels to the
foot of Mount Thaur fulfilling his agreement. It was a credit to the
Arabian sense of honor and national character that Abdullah bin
Uraiqit who, although not a Muslim, kept the matter secret. He
brought the two she-camels and his own camel near the foot of Mount
Thaur on a moonlit night of Rabi' Al-Awwal, while Asma' t;., turned
up with parched barley and meal.
Muhammad
and Abu Bakr ~ came out of the cave of Thaur. He
mounted a she-camel named Al-Qaswa, while Abu Bakr~ and his
slave Amir bin Fuhairah got on the other she-camel. Abdullah bin
Uraiqit serving as a guide, mounted his own camel. This small
caravan of four secretly moved forward through routes away from

I
I

Prophet Muhammad ft

143

the main road. An event worth mentioning took place when the
caravan was about to set out. The bag of food brought by Asma' $, ,
was without a string. When the bag was to be suspended from the
camel's saddle, there was no string to serve this purpose. Asma' ~
made no delay in tearing her waistband in two tying one half around
her waist and with the other half, she tied the bag. This ready solution
put forward by Asma'~ won for her praise from the Prophet ~ who
also named her "The Lady with the String." She was later known by
this title. Another interesting event that took place was that Abu Bakr
~ took with him all his cash which, amounted to five or six thousand
dirhams. His father, Quhafah who was blind and still a disbeliever,
came in and told his grand daughters that Abu Bakr ~ went away
with all the riches of the house. Asma' ~ replied, "Grandfather, he
has left enough money for us." Then she wrapped up a large number
of pebbles in a piece of cloth and put it at the place where the money
was always kept. She then caught the hand of her grandfather and
took him to that spot. After touching it he was satisfied about the
presence of money. Then he said to his granddaughters, "The
departure of Abu Bakr now is no long a matter of sorrow."

Migration
Before mounting Al-Qaswa, the Prophet ~ looked at Makka:h and
said overwhelmed with grief: "O Makkah! You are to me dearest of all
the cities. But your citizens allowed me not to reside here." Following
this Abu Bakr ~ said, "They have banished their Prophet and they
are now bound to be ruined." About the same time this Ayah (Verse) was
revealed:
"Permission to fight is given to those who are fought against
because they have been wronged; and surely, Allah is Able to
give them victory." (22:39)
It is worth considering how and under what rigorous circumstances

they embraced Islam and remained firm and stuck to the truth in the
face of opposition from all quarters and at the cost of soul-shattering
torture and persecution. Could anyone dare imply that they had come
to the fold of Islam under threats or out of greed? No, not at all! Now,
after the revelation of this Verse begins the era when the believers

144

History of Islam

were permitted to face and fight those who obstructed the path of
Islam. It is interesting to watch how people in large numbers accepted
Islam under these trying situation that lay ahead.
This small caravan set out in the early part of the night. The next day,
on Rabi' Al-Awwal 1, the 14th year of Prophethood, they arrived at
the tent of Umm Ma'bad in the afternoon. That old woman belonged
to the Khuza'ah tribe. She used to serve travelers water and drinks.
The Prophet ~ halted there, took milk and then resumed his journey
after a short rest. They had moved a little ahead when Suraqah bin
Malik appeared on the scene pursuing the Prophet ~ Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum was a famous warrior. He was once
sitting in his dwelling place along with his companions when, in the
early morning, a man came and revealed that he had witnessed three
riders on camel moving in such and such direction. He presumed that
they must be Muhammad ~ and his companions. Suraqah made a
sign to silence him and said that he knew very well who those
travelers were, and that they were such and such persons who had
left on a journey last night. By this ploy Suraqah meant to chase and
catch the Prophet~ to get the reward of the one hundred camels and
he wanted no one else to share in it. He came home in a hurry, sent
his horse and weapons outside the dwelling and then he himself
reached the spot where his horse was evading others' eyes. He
hurried after the fugitives tracking their footprints. He let his horse go
at a canter until the fugitives came into the full view. But his horse
stumbled abruptly and he was thrown off. He remounted his horse
but it again stumbled and he was thrown off. But he continued his
chase until his horse stumbled for the third time, and he was thrown
off again.
Such a queer misfortune sent fear through his body and he felt sure
that his attempt would have to be given up. Then admitting his
failure, he called out to the Prophet ~ to halt and listen to him. He ~
stopped his movement. Suraqah drew near and said, "I had come to
take you back to Makkah as a prisoner. But I now seek your pardon.
Please write for me a warrant of security besides forgiving me for my
evil intentions. I promise to take back with me all those coming in this
direction who have the same purpose as I did." Thus, with the order

Prophet Muhammad jf

145

of the Prophet ~, either Abu Bakr ~ or Amir bin Fuhairah wrote the
warrant sitting on the camel's back and threw it towards him. He
turned back with the warrant and took back all others assuring them
that the Prophet ~ was long gone and traceless. Suraqah embraced
Islam after the conquest of Makkah and the warrant of security was a
source of safety for him.
From the cave of Thaur and the low-lying land of Makkah, Abdullah
bin Uraiqit took the Prophet ~ to the coastal area. Passing across the
main track to the other side of Usfan. He continued his journey up to
Qudaid through the valley of Amaj and then cutting across the main
road he came down into the field of Kharar Laqaf, Mudlijah and Majaj
crossing the territory of Dhul-Ghadwin and passing through the
grove of Dhu Salam they crossed Al-Ababid and Al-Arj. In the valley
of Al-Atj, a camel of the caravan became exhausted. A man of Aslam clan
brought a camel from Aus bin Hajar, who also gave a slave to
accompany the Prophet ~ - From there the caravan, after crossing
Thaniyatul-Air, reached the valley of Reem, and from there to Quba'
at noon.
After Suraqah bin Malik retreated, the caravan had marched a little
ahead when Zubair bin Awwam ~ came across them on his way back
to Makkah at the head of his trade caravan. He gave gifts of garments
to the Prophet ~ with his fervent desire to join the Prophet * in AlMadinah after reaching Makkah. During this journey, people at various
places recognized Abu Bakr ~ ', for they had so often seen him leading
trade caravans. However, they were not familiar with the Prophet ~
and so, they asked Abu Bakr ~ about the person going ahead of him.
He replied, "This is my leader and the guide."

End of the Journey
After an eight-day journey, the Prophet * arrived at Quba' on Rabia
al-Awwal 8, the 14th year of Prophethood (corresponding September
23, 622 CE) at noon. Quba' lies at a distance of a few miles from AlMadinah and was generally taken as the locality of Al-Madinah. It
was largely inhabited by Banu Amr bin Auf who had already been
enlightened by Islam. A few days before the departure of the Prophet
* from Makkah, the news of his arrival in Al-Madinah was in the air.

146

History of Islam

The Ansar of Al-Madinah would come out of their dwellings early in
the morning and kept waiting till noon everyday. Thus when the
Prophet ~ arrived at Quba' at noon, they had already gone back after
waiting for some time.
A certain Jew who was watching the crowds of Muslims awaiting
someone by coming out of their settlement knew that Muhammad ~
was about to come from Makkah. This Jew was then, by chance,
upstairs when he witnessed the small caravan moving into Quba'.
Guessing it to be the caravan of the Prophet ~ ,he cried at the top of
his voice: "O the people of Arabia, 0 those taking rest at noon, there
has come your object of love." Having heard this call, the people
rushed out of their dwellings and waves of exultation gripped the
whole atmosphere of Quba'. He ~ was emerging from an orchard of
dates. Bearing in mind that the people might fall into confusion
regarding the identification of the Prophet ~, Abu Bakr ~ drew
himself back and shaded the Prophet ~ with his mantle, thus making
a clear distinction between the master and the servant.
The Prophet ~ was now entering Quba' and the little girls of the
Ansar were reciting in great fervor and boundless joy:
"On the hillside whence caravans are given a send-off,
The full moon comes up in the day.
All the while Allah is praised.
We had better return our thanks
The noble one, 0 you sent to us,
You have brought binding commands."
The Prophet ~ entered Quba' on Monday and stayed there until
Friday. The Prophet ~ stayed in the house of Kulthum bin Hadm
while Abu Bakr~ stayed with Habib bin Asaf ~ . He ~ would hold
his assemblies in the house of Sa'd bin Khaithamah ~ and the people
visited him at that same place. During this short stay in Quba', he ~
laid the foundation of a mosque which is the first mosque ever built
after the advent of Islam. On Friday, the 12th Rabi' Al-Awwal, he left
Quba' and made his entry into Al-Madinah. He ~ was still in Quba'
when Ali bin Abu Talib ~ came and joined him. Ali~ had made
this long and arduous journey on foot. While the Prophet ~ was

Prophet Muhammad it

147

staying in Quba', Ali ~ who had been busy returning the deposits of
the people to their rightful owners was blessed with the honor of
joining the Prophet ~ - He had left Makkah the very day the Prophet
:~ left the cave of Thaur. But Ali ~ ' a traveler by himself, made his
movement during the night and kept himself hidden in the day. The
Prophet ~ came avoiding the busy thoroughfares and reached Quba'
in eight days, while Ali ~ undertook the journey by the well-known
routes but was made late by three or four days because of being on
foot.

Entry into AI-Madinah
Taking leave of the people of Quba' and Banu Amr bin Auf on Friday,
the Prophet * moved forw a rd to make his stay in Al-Madinah. Every
household of each loc ..Jitv expressed its strong desire that the Prophet
?~
would stay with them. He was in the locality of Banu Salim bin Auf
when the time for the Friday (/umu 'ah) prayer drew near. The Prophet
~ led the prayer at the same place in a field with about a hundred
men behind him. This was the first Friday prayer of the Prophet ~ in
Al-Madinah and the first time the Friday sermon (Khutbah) was ever
delivered. Later on, a mosque was built at that place.
After offering the Friday prayer, the Prophet ~ mounted his shecamel. Banu Salim bM1 Auf approached him and took hold of his shecamel's halter with the request that he stay with them. The people of
other clans and localities also came in groups and made the same
request. This led to a clash of words, which ended when the Prophet
~ said to one and all: "Let her go her way. She is guided by Allah. I
shall stop where the animal sits down." The Ansar and Muhiijirfn
followed the she-camel on all sides. He set the halter loose and free
and the she-camel moved ahead slowly. All eyes were focused on the
animal and they were eagerly waiting for it to kneel down.
When she entered the locality of Banu Biyadah, Ziyad bin La bid and
Urwah bin Amr, the chieftains of the tribe wanted to take hold of the
halter but the Prophet ~ forbade them saying: "Leave her for she has
already been commanded." Then the she-camel stepped into the
locality of Banu Sa'idah and Sa'd bin Ubadah and Mundhir bin Amr,
the chieftains of Banu Sa'idah made the same attempt but received the

148

History of Islam

same words from the Prophet ~ - After this, she reached the locality of
Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj, and Sa'd bin Ar-Rabi', Kharijah bin Zaid
and Abdullah bin Rawahah stepped forward to stop her but received
the same reply. From there the she-camel made an entry into the
locality of Banu Adi bin An-Najjar. Since Abdul-Muttalib's mother
Salma hint Amr belonged to this clan, they made their claim for the
Prophet ~ to stop there. Thus Salit bin Qais and Asirah bin Abu
Kharija, the chieftains of Banu Adi took hold of the halter but he ~
asked them to leave it for the animal had prior instructions for herself.
At last the she-camel arrived at the locality of Banu Malik bin AnNajjar and knelt down in a deserted and fallow land for a while and
then got up and advanced a little only to turn back and be seated on
the same spot again. This time she shook herself and then lay down
on her neck wagging her tail.
Close to this unpopulated land was the house of Abu Ayub Khalid
bin Zaid Ansari ~ - He rushed to the spot with his face beaming with
·joy and took the belongings of the Prophet ~ to his house. Thus he ~
made his stay in his house. The deserted land was the property of two
orphan boys Sahl and Suhail. The piece of land had a few date trees,
graves of the polytheists and a resting spot for the herds of cattle.
"Who is the owner of this land?" The Prophet~ inquired. Mu'adh bin
Afra' submitted, "This piece of land belongs to two orphan boys
related to me and they are nourished by me; I shall make them agree,
you may take it for building a mosque." But the Prophet ~ asserted,
"I want to buy it, and will not take it without paying the price." Abu
Bakr ~ made the payment at once. And with the order of th e Prophet
~ the date trees were cut, the graves leveled, and the construction
work of the mosque was started then and there. The Prophet ~ joined
the builders. The walls of the mosque were constructed with stone
and kneaded clay, the roof with the wood of the date palm and date
leaves. Until the construction of a separate house for himself, the
Prophet ~ remained staying with Abu Ayub Ansari ~ in his house
as his guest. This is the same Abu Ayub Ansari ~ whose grave lies in
Constantinople where he was honored later with martyrdom during
the siege of Constantinople in the caliphate of Mu'awiyah in 48 AH.

f

Prophet Muhammad .:Jli

149

Prophet ~ stayed in the house of Abu Ayub Ansari• for six months
and a few days. The mosque built during the time of the Prophet ~
saw no change before the caliphate of Umar • . During his caliphate,
it underwent an expansion for the first time. Uthman bin Affan .:$,
strengthened it. During the time of Walid bin Abdul-Malik, it saw more
expansion with the inclusion of the dwellings of the noble wives of
the Prophet~- Mamun Rashid Abbasi adorned the mosque beautifully.
The Prophet ~ was in the house of Abu Ayub Ansari .:$, when he sent
Zaid bin Harithah and Abu Rafi ~ to bring Fatimah, Umm Kulthum,
Saudah hint Zam 'ah, Usamah bin Zaid and his mother, Umm Aiman
~- Abdullah bin Abu Bakr ~ also, along with his relatives,
accompanied them. Talhah bin Ubaidullah .:$, also joined the caravan.
After the arrival of these people, the Prophet;i shifted to his newly
built house.

Calendar Year
Until now the year of Prophethood was being used to keep account of
the time. It is notable that the name and the order of the lunar months
are the same as was the custom in Arabia from before. Thus the first
year of Prophethood elapsed just in a few months. This is the reason
why the entry of the Prophet ~ into Al-Madinah is being reported in
the month of Rabi ' Al-Awwal, the 14th year of the Prophethood,
while his Prophethood was actually spread over a span of 12 1 / 2 years.
Similarly, the Hijrah C1lendar starts from the Prophet's emigration to
Al-Madinah. Since he~ had come to Al-Madinah on Rabi ' Al-Awwal
12, the first Hijrah year began from Muharram; Thus the Prophet :j
stayed in the house of ~bu Ayub Ansari~ until the 2nd Hijrah year.

First Year of Migration
Among the events of the first year of migration, the construction of
the Prophet's Mosque and his house, and the arrival of the rest of the
believers to Al-Madinah has already been mentioned. The death of
Abu Umamah As'ad bin Zurarah ~ is worthy of mention here. Abu
Umamah • was not suffering from any disease. All of sudden he fell
ill and passed away. When this sad news was given the Prophet :I, he
remarked, "The polytheists have got an opportunity to say, 'what

North

r

Qanat Valley

:\\-Madina

Prophet Muhammad !ft

151

kind of Prophet is he that one of his Companions becomes the target
of sudden death'." After his death, the people of Banu Najjar
presented themselves to the Prophet ~ and submitted, "Abu
Umamah was our chief. Please choose for us another chief in his
place. " The Prophet~ replied , "You Banu Najjar are all my maternal
uncles, so I belong to you. Thus l am myself your chief." Hearing this,
Banu Najjar's joy knew no bounds. Moreover, this device warded off
the possibility of other candidates for chief clashing over this matter.
The courage and determination of the clan increased.
The first objective of the Prophet ~ was to achieve law and order and
good mutual relations among the people. He :I; felt right away that
the Muhnjirin had come from Makkah and so they must not become a
source of constant mental stress for the people of Al-Madinah. But he
was equally conscious of the stark reality that the Muhajirin had
migrated from Makkah sacrificing everything for their faith, their
homes, motherland, relatives, wealth, property, family and clan. They
should be treated in a manner that they were not overtaken by a deep
sense of loss, dejection and frustration. Thus the Prophet~ convened
a meeting of the Muhtijirin and the Anstir and told them about the
virtues of Islamic brotherhood . He then established bonds of
brotherhood between the Muluijirin and the Ansar, putting them
together in an atmosphere of mutual welfare. Each Ansar took a
Mulu'ijir as his brother.
Abu Bakr's brother in faith was Kharijah bin Zubair Ansari and Umar
bin Khattab entered the bond of brotherhood with Utban bin Malik
Ansari, Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah with Sa'd bin Mu'adh Ansari,
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf with Sa'd bin Ar-Rabi', Zubair bin AlAwwam with Salilmah bin Salamah, Uthman bin Affan with Thabit
bin AI-Mundhir Ansari. Similarly, Talhah bin Ubaidullah and Ka'b
bin Malik, Mus'ab bin Umair and Abu Ayub Ansari, Ammar bin Yasir
and Hudhaifah bin Al-Yaman :$, mutually consolidated their bonds
of brotherhood.
The Ansar remained faithful to this arrangement with so much caution
and sincerity that human history is unable to give any other similar
example. The Ansar treated their Muhajir brothers like their own and
entrusted to them their wealth and property in abundance. Some of

152

History of Islam

the Ansar went to such an extent that they wanted to divorce one of
their two wives and to give one to their brother in faith to marry. But
the Muhajirin also disliked being a burden on their Ansari brothers
and undertook a life of sweat and toil to shoulder their own burden.

First Political Document
One event worth mentioning after the migration was a pact that the
Prophet ~ had drawn up for the inhabitants of Al-Madinah,
including the Jews and the polytheists. [nclud ed in it were a number
of terms and conditions. The main condition being that, in case of an
attack on Al-Madinah launched by outsiders, the people of AlMadinah as a whole would raise arms together against the enemies.
Another condition being that the Jews of Al-Madinah would not
provide refuge to the Quraish of Makkah o'r th eir allies. None of the
citizens of Al-Madinah would put any hurdle in the way of anyone
else's religion, life or property. If two people of AI-Madinah had a
falling-out on an issue and were not abl e to find any solution to it by
themselves, they would have to abide by the decision made by the
Prophet ~ concerning it. The burden of the war expenditures would
be shared equally by all the people of Al-Madinah. The Muslims of
Al-Madinah would be considered as friends of the Jews, so also they
(the Jews) would have to treat as friend those tribes and clans who
were in alliance with the Muslims. All kind s of fighting and
bloodshed would be treated as prohibited in the territory of AlMadinah. All the people of AI-Madinah were to be considered bound
to help the oppressed . This pact was signed by all the tribes of AlMadinah.
After the agreement was finalized, the Prophet ~ made an all-out
effort to bring the clans around Al-Madinah into the fold of this pact
so that all kinds of disruptions, disorder and bloodshed were curbed
once and for all. The Prophet :i was so eager to widen the scope of
this pact that he IJ1ade a special journey to Banu Damrah bin Bakr bin
Abd Manaf to bring them around to this recently signed pact. He ~
won over their chief, Amr bin Makhshi to the idea and he put his
initials on the document. He also got the people of Mount Buwat and
of Dhul-Ushairah in Yanbu and Banu Mudlij to accept the peace

Prophet Muhammad jj

153

treaty. The purpose of the Prophet ~ behind this peace pact was to
create an atmosphere of peace and order so that the people could be at
peace and be able to reflect on the message of Islam in an air of safety
and security. These peace efforts were yet to bring fruit when
clandestine activities in Al-Madinah and onslaughts from outside
plunged Al-Madinah into disorder once again.

Beginning of Hypocrisy
There happened to be in Al-Madinah a man of great wisdom,
experience and astuteness and he wielded influence both on the Aus
and the Khazraj. A short time before, both of the tribes had the bloody
battle of Bu'ath, in this battle they lost much of their power and
strength and Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was shrewd enough to take
advantage of their weaknesses. His clever tricks achieved for him
immense popularity among both tribes. While the people were
making up their minds about installing Abdullah bin Obai as the chief
or king of Al-Madinah, Islam started to take hold in Al-Madinah.
They had planned to celebrate the occasion of Abdullah's ascension to
leadership on a very high level and even a crown had already been
made for him. With the advent of Islam in Al-Madinah, the atmosphere
changed beyond recognition.
After the arrival of the Prophet ~ in Al-Madinah, the Muslims
became its mightiest power. Furthermore, the peace pact made all the
people of Al-Madinah recognize the strength and supremacy of Islam
and they all signed it signifying their acceptance of the superiority of
the Muslims. The grand dreams of Abdullah bin Ubai were shattered
into pieces. Since he was shrewd before anything else, he never
highlighted hi s grievances but he harbored malice against the Prophet
ji; from the day he appeared in AI-Madinah. The idolaters among the
Aus and the Kha zraj tribes were still under the influence of Abdullah
bin Ubai. When the Quraish of Makkah found out that the Prophet i;
and his Companions were enjoying a peaceful life after arriving in AlMadinah, and the circle of Islam was expanding by leaps and bounds,
they felt terribly disturbed. Shooting their first arrow at Islam in AlMadinah they wrote a letter to Abdullah bin Ubai and the polytheists
of Al-Madinah. They warned them against providing refuge to the

154

History of Islam

fugitives and asked them to expel them (the Muslims) from their
territory, failing this they should be ready to face an onslaught on AlMadinah ending in the killing of their young and the capturing of
their women.

In the wake of receiving this message from the Quraish of Makkah,
Abdullah bin Ubai assembled all the polytheists and kindled flames
of fighting in their hearts. At the opportune mom ent, the Prophet ~
was informed of the development and he hurried to the gathering of
the people and said to them: "The Quraish of Makkah have attempted
to deceive you and you will suffer heavy losses if you become victims
of their allurement. It is better for you to reject their warning flatly and
keep to your agreement finalized between you and us. ln case the
Quraish make an assault against the people of Al-Madinah, it will be
easier to fight them if we are united. But if you fight the Muslims, you are
bound to kill your own sons and close relatives with your own swords
and bring upon yourselves complete destruction. Having heard the wise
counsel of the Prophet ~ ' the entire gathering followed his point and
dispersed at once. They deserted Abdullah bin Ubai and he was left alone
looking pathetic.
The same year, the Muslim~began to u se the Adhan to call the people
to perform prayer in congregation. It was also the year when
Abdullah bin Salam ~ , a great scholar of the Jews, accepted Islam .
Salman the Persian also embraced Islam after accepting Christianity
and had gone through the scriptures of the Jews and the Christi ans
who w ere awaiting the ad vent of the last Prophet. The payment of
Za kat was also made obliga tory in thi s yea r.

The Second Year of Migration
The Quraish appeared defeated in the wake of the Prophet's
departure to Al-Madinah unharmed. The acute sense of shameful
defeat had filled them with a madd ening pain which could be cured
only by ta king a satisfa ctory revenge. The simple goal before the
Makkan polytheists w as to cause d eath and destructi on to the Prophet
~ and his Muslim followers. This w ild rage had taken them by storm.
Putting asid e their petty differences and discord , they had risen to the

Prophet Muhammad~

155

occasion as one individual with the single purpose of punishing the
followers of Islam. There lay a distance of 300 miles between Makkah
and Al-Madinah. Special care and preparations were needed for the
Makkans to invade Al-Madinah along with winning the sympathies of
the tribes living on the way and forming alliances with the forces hostile
to Islam.
The Prophet ~ was, on the other hand, wise enough to foresee the
lurking menace and he had to play his role as a reliable chief and an
experienced and skilful commander. Permission for defensive fighting
had already been received. Thus the time for removing the obstructions
in the way of Islam had arrived. The Muslim population in Al-Madinah
was, in no way, more than three or four hundred. But, in spite of lacking
numbers and weapons, the evil designs and mischief of the disbelievers
was more than enough to kindle in their hearts determination and
ignite their Arabian sense of honor and bravery. They repeatedly
placed before the Prophet ~ their deep desire to raise arms against
the enemies of Islam and sought his permission to fight.
When the love of Islam went deep into the hearts of the believers and
they appeared mentally prepared to fight the forces inimical to Islam,
permission from Allah the Almighty came for curbing the evildoers.
However, the series of events taking place provide ample proof that
the Messenger of Islam preferred peace to war and forgiveness to
revenge. A chieftain of Makkah, Kurz bin Jabir came from Makkah
along with a band of people, and raided some grazing cattle nearAlMadinah and made off with a large number of camels belonging to
the believers. When the Muslims got the news, they chased the
criminals but they escaped. However, it was a serious warning for the
people of Al-Madinah that their enemies could rob them of their
goods and property at a distance of about three hundred miles from
their houses. Besides, the disbelievers were constantly in
correspondence with Abdullah bin Ubai and the Jews of Al-Madinah
conspiring against the Muslim interests.
During Sha'ban of this year, the Qiblah (direction of pr:iyer) was
changed for the Muslims to Makkah and the fasting of Ramadan was
made obligatory before the end of Sha'ban. At the beginning of the
month of Ramadan, news came to Al-Madinah that a Makkan caravan

156

History of Islam

was corning from Syria which would pass by Al-Madinah. In order to
instill fear in the disbelievers and also to reply to Kurz bin Jabir's attack,
the Prophet i; asked a party of the Muhajirin and Ansar to intercept
the caravan so that the Makkans would know that to worsen the
relations with the people of AI-Madinah might prove injurious to their
trading activities with Syria. This party was sent with the sole purpose of
frightening them and not for fighting.
The Makkan trade caravan became informed of the movement of the
Muslim party. Abu Sufyan, the head of the caravan, led it off the main
routes. He also hired Darndam bin Amr Ghifari to hurry to Makkah with
the information that the caravan was facing danger from the Muslims,
and they should rush to help it and save their goods. In the wake of this
news, Abu Jahl marched forward with great enthusiasm from Makkah at
the head of a large army consisting of seven hundred camels and three
hundred horses. The entire army was armed to the teeth and the reciters
of martial songs also accompanied the army. Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib,
Utbah bin Rabi'ah, Urnayyah bin Khalf, Nadar bin Harith, Abu Jahl
bin Hisharn and others, a total of thirteen men in all were assigned the
duty of serving food to the army. The Muslim party sent to terrorize
the trade caravan came back to Al-Madinah.

The Battle of Badr
Abu Sufyan sent word to Abu Jahl that he had arrived at Makkah and
that he should also come back. But Abu Jahl turned down the suggestion.
Abu Jahl had, in truth, not come out with the army simply to provide
safety but also to avenge the killing of Amr bin Hadrarni at the hands of a
Muslim party dispatched by the Prophet ?i to Nakhlah to probe some
incident.
The Quraish had already started preparations to retaliate. They were
about to invade Al-Madinah when Damdam bin Amr reached Makkah
to seek their help. Abu Jahl was marching towards Al-Madinah. The
Prophet ~ became aware of the movement of the Quraish army and all
the notable chieftains like Abu Jahl, Utbah, Shaibah, Walid, Hanzalah,
Ubaidah, Asi, Harth, Tuaimah, Zam'ah, Aqil, Abul-Bakhtari, Mas'ud,
Munabbih, Nabih, Naufal, Sa'ib, and Rifa'ah accompanying the Makkan
troops.

Prophet Muhammad .#

157

The Prophet :i summoned his followers and asked for their advice
regarding the current development and said to the Companions:
"Makkah has sent you its darlings. What do you think about facing
them?" First of all Abu Bakr~ and then Umar bin Khattab ,$ and
Miqdad ~ uttered words of valor and determination. The last one
said: "O Prophet of Allah, we will not say as the Children of Israel
said to Moses: 'Go you and your Lord and fight, we will sit here'."
The Prophet ~ asked again for their advice. By this he really wanted
to know the reaction of the Ansar for all the three who had pledged
their support and loyalty belonged to the Muhajirin. When the
Prophet :i put the same question again, the Ansar now realized that
the question was meant for them.
Their original pledge with him implied their defending him in AlMadinah and did not put them under any obligation to take part in a
military expedition outside their territory. Sa'd bin Mu'adh •
immediately got up to say in reply: "O Prophet of Allah, it seems as if
you are speaking to us and you want to have our answer." "Yes," the
Prophet ~ said. Sa'd ~ then said, "We have believed in you and
have full faith in your being Allah's Messenger. How can it be
possible that Allah's Messenger would go out to fight the disbelievers
and we remain sitting in our houses? These disbelievers are, after all,
men like us. How can we fear them? If you command us to plunge
into the sea, we will do so."

I Lack of Means:
Satisfied with the staunch support and determination of the
Companions, the Prophet~ resolved to march out. The total number
of the combatants did not exceed 310 or 312 or 313. When they were
finally examined outside the city, some minor children were found
accompanying the troops who were not fit to take part in battle yet.
Thus the Prophet ~ asked them to go back. Some of them persistently
entreated to be enlisted and of those some were granted permission to
accompany the army. It was in no way a well-equipped force. This
Islamic army had only two horses under the charge of Zubair bin
Awwam and Miqdad ~ and seventy camels to be mounted by three
or four persons at a time. Many others accompanied on foot. On

reaching Badr, the Islamic army noticed that the enemy force had
already captured the raised piece of land and pitched their tents on it.
The Muslims had to take the low-lying sandy spot. However, the
jwells of Badr were under the control of the Muslim force. The Prophet
j~ issued orders that any of the disbelievers coming for water must
jnot be stopped. A hut of palm branches was erected for the Prophet~
jon an elevation overlooking the battlefield. He prayed and invoked
'the help and blessings of Allah .

The number of the Companions were one-third of the Makkans, and
1their weapons were less than one-hundredth of what the Quraish
army had. Their army consisted of young and strong men, and all
wearing armor. The Muslims were, on the other hand, starving, weak,
sick and old. Most of them didn't even possess simple weapons. Some
of them had swords but no bows and arrows, while others possessed
spears but no swords. When the Muslims encamped, the disbelievers
sent Umair bin Wahb Jumahi as a spy to find out the number of
Muslim soldiers. Umair reported that they were not more than 310,
having a total cavalry of only two. The height of the disbelievers
jarrogance may be gauged from the statement of Utbah bin R;:i bi'ah
who scornfully remarked, " Let us go back without a fight ," meaning
the disgracefully low number of the Muslims was no match for the
large and well-equipped army of the ~;h1kkans. t.lui Abu Jahl
j vehemently opposed the proposal expressing his firm detcrminatiun
I to exterminate them no matter how few they were.
I

II Beginning of War:

IAt last, on Ramad an 17, 2 AH, when the two armies came fa ce to face,
the Prophet ~ returned to his small hut ,ind beseeched Allah for
Divine help. He entreated the Lord:

I! "O Alliih! If vou were to exterminc1te this small roup of
g.

I

Muslims, you will be worshipped on earth no more." "

He then offered two Rak'ah of prayer. Following this, he dozed a little
and then cc1me out fresh and smiling from his hut and s;:iid with
utmost confidence:
"The ent>my fnrn' is defeated . They took to their heels."

160

History of Islam

The Prophet ~ had already issued an order not to initiate the fighting .
There were approximately eighty Muslims from the Muhajirin and the
rest belonged to the Ansar. Among the Ansar, sixty-one were from the
Aus and one hundred and seventy from Kha zraj. The ranks on both
sides were set in order. The Prophet~ was setting the ranks with an
arrow in his hand.
In the meantime, in accordance with the Arabian fashion, Utbah and
Shaibah-sons of Rabi'ah and Walid bin Utbah stepped forward, and
in response to their call, three of the Ansar, Auf and Mu'awwidh-the
sons of Afra' and Abdullah bin Rawahah came forward to give them
battle. Utbah asked, "Who are you?" "We are the Ansdr," they
answered. "We need not fight with you," Utbah said in a tone filled
with arrogance. He then called out: "O Muhammad; send our peers,
men of our own tribe." The Prophet~ said, "Go ahead, 0 Hamzah
bin Abdul-Muttalib to give battle to Utbah, Ubaidah bin Al-Harith to
fight with Shaibah-the brother of Utbah, and Ali bin Abu Talib to
engage Walid-the son of Utbah." With the order, all the three
Companions rose from their spots and came face to face with their
respective rivals. Utbah wanted to know their names although he
knew them very well. Then hearing their names he said, "Yes, we will
fight with you." The confrontation began . Hamzah and Ali~ put the
father and the son Utbah and Walid to the sword . Ubaidah ~ and
Shaibah both received injuries in the encounter. Ali bin Abu Talib and
Hamzah ~ , did away with the enemy of Islam and brought Ubaidah
~ to the Prophet ~ Now the disbelivers launched a full-scale attack and the Muslim
troops also moved forward to face their enemies. Both sides showed
great valor. As the day of Badr drew towards its close, the defeated
disbelievers fled the battlefield leaving behind seventy men slain and
seventy as prisoners. When the fighting started, the Prophet ~ came
out to have a full view of the situation. He pointed out to the Muslims
that Banu Hashim did not join the enemy force out of their own will
and desire, it was due only to compulsion and so they deserved
special concessions. So Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib must not be killed,
and Abul-Bakhtari also deserves forgiveness. Abu Hudhaifah ~ said,
"How can it be that I kill my brother and leave Abbas bin Abdul-

Prophet Muhammad~

161

Muttalib, I will not Jet him go if Abbas fights with me." Later on
Hudhaifah ~ was deeply repentant for his words and expressed
great regret.
Mujadhdhir bin Ziyad~ happened to face Abul-Bakhtari and said to
him, "I have been ordered not to fight with you, so keep away." But
Abul-Bakhtari made an attempt to save a friend of his and was killed.
Umayyah bin Khala f and his son Ali bin Umayyah were in great
distress to save their lives. During the d ays of Ignorance AbdurRahman bin Auf ~ and Umayyah were close friends, so he gave him
protection. But th e moment Bilal ~ noticed him, he called some
A11snr and they together fell on Umayyah and his son and did away
with them despite Abdur-Rahman's efforts to save them. Umair bin
Al-Hamam ~ came to the Prophet ~ eating dates and asked, "Shall I
go to Paradise at once if I am killed fighting the disbelievers?" He
said, "Yes." He threw away the dates in his hand and ran to the
battlefield and fought with the enemy until h e was honored with
martyrdom.
When the battle was in full swing, the Prophet ~ picked a handful of
dust and threw it towa rds the disbelievers after reciting something
over it. It resulted in the enemy fighters fleeing for their lives. Mu'adh
bin Amr ~ ' a young Ansnr came across Abu Jahl who was armor
clad. Mu'adh bin Amr~ struck at his uncovered leg with his sword
so forcefully that it was cut off from the shin. When Ikrimah bin Abu
Jahl found his father fatally injured, he fell upon Mu'adh bin Amr ~
and struck him with his sword so violently that his left arm was
I nearly separated from the shoulder but he kept fighting the whole
1
day with the hanging arm. But when it gave him more trouble, he put
the hanging part under his foot and pulled apart by a violent force. At
the sa me moment Mu 'awwidh bin Afra' ~' another young man from
the A11sar drew nea r Abu Jahl and put him to the sword.

I

When the disbelievers fled the battlefield and the believers were
victorious in this historic event, Allah's Messenger ~ asked for a search
of the dead body of Abu Jahl. Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~ searched through
the dead bodies and found Abu Jahl lying haU-dead. Abdullah bin
Mas 'ud ~ got on his chest and said, 'Behold, 0 enemy of Allah, what a
disgrace you have been put to by Allah." Abu Jahl said, "What's the

162

History of Islam

outcome of battle?" Abdullah bin Mas'ud • replied, "It ended in victory
for the believers and defeat for the disbelievers." When he was about to
cut his head off he said, "Cut off my head from near the shoulders so that
it looks bigger than the heads of all others and it is seen as the head of a
chief." Abdullah bin Mas'ud • chopped his head off and laid it down at
the feet of the Prophet 11. Having noticed it, Allah's Messenger ~
thanked Allah. This battle martyred fourteen believers, six from the
Muhajirin and eight from the Ansar. The battle being over, Allah's
Messenger 11 buried the believers and ordered that the dead among the
infidels should be thrown into a pit or well and let them be covered with
dust.
The disbelievers were so frightened when they fled the field that they
even lost track of their Commander, Abu Jahl and left him behind
fatally injured and dying. Harth bin Zam'ah, Abu Qais bin AlFakihah, Ali bin Umayyah and As bin Utbah were young men and
had deep sympathy with the Prophet ~ in Makkah; or they had
secretly accepted Islam. After the migration of the Prophet ~ and his
Companions, they were flayed and decried by their clansmen and
relatives and pressed to return to their former faith . So they openly
disobeyed Allah's Messenger ?I and joined the battle against Islam.
They were all killed in the battle along with all the notable chieftains
from the Quraish. The soul-shattering news of the disbelievers'
ignominious defeat in the battlefield of Badr left the Makkans struck
with grief.
The Prophet ~ entrusted the booty to Abdullah bin Ka'b ~ who
belonged to Banu Najjar, and sent Abdullah bin Rawahah and Zaid
bin Harithah ~ with the glad tidings of victory to the upper and
lower settlements of Al-Madinah. Usamah bin Zaid ~ who was left
in Al-Madinah as the deputy of the Prophet~, remarks, "The glad
tidings of the victory were received by us at a time when we were
burying Ruqayyah ~, the daughter of the Prophet~ and the wife of
Uthman bin Affan ~- The news of victory had arrived in Al-Madinah
on 18 Ramadan."
Being free from his engagement in the battlefield of Badr, the Prophet
~ proceeded to Al-Madinah. On reaching Safra', he with the
Command of Allah the Almighty, distributed the booty equally

Prophet Muhammad !Ji

163

among the Muslims, and ordered Nadr bin Al-Harith bin Kildah
(from Banu Abdud-Dar) to be beheaded. Similarly, arriving at Irq-uzZabyah, he issued the same order for Uqbah bin Abu Mu'ait bin Abu
Amr bin Linah. These two among the prisoners of the battle of Badr
were hard-core and ruthless enemies of the Prophet :I and Islam and
equal to Abu Jahl in enmity. Thereafter the Prophet :I, along with his
Companions, speedily left for Al-Madinah leaving the prisoners and
their guards behind who joined them in Al-Madinah the next day.

General Treatment of the Prisoners:
When the captives reached Al-Madinah, the Prophet ~ said
distributing them among the Companions, "Treat them generously."
Among them was Abu Aziz bin Umair who was the standard-bearer
of the disbelievers' army and also the full brother of Mus'ab bin
Umair • . Abu Aziz relates, "When I was being brought to AIMadinah, I was in the custody of a group of the Ansar. Whenever they
sat down to dine, they gave bread to me and they began to eat dates.
Being ashamed, I tried to return it but whenever I gave the bread to
any of them, he gave it back to me." On reaching Al-Madinah, Abu
Aziz was lodged with Abu Yusr Ansari .:ij,. Mus'ab bin Umair • said
to Abu Yusr Ansari ..,, '1'reat him roughly, for his mother is a
wealthy woman." Abu Aziz said, "Brother, is it for you to give this
counsel?" "You are not my brother," replied Umair ~' "instead he is
my brother who is tying up your hands." The mother of Abu Aziz
sent four thousand dirhams for his release.
The defeat suffered by the polytheists prunged Makkah into gloom.
There was not a house in the city, which did not go into mourning.
The Makkans stood aghast and agitated. However, the suppressed
Muslims of Makkah breathed a sigh of relief and felt elated. Abu
Lahab, who could not join the army at Badr, was so terribly shocked
that he died after a week.

The Issue of the Captives:
Concerning the captives, Allah's Messenger ~ sought the advice of
the Companions. Umar bin Khattab ~ submitted, "In my opinion
everyone of us should kill his own relatives to establish beyond doubt

164

History of Islam

that, in Islam, love of faith is far greater than love for relations." Abu
Bakr ~ said, "Let all the captives be released in return for reasonable
ransoms so that the amount be invested in developing weaponry.
Besides, some of them may embrace Islam in future." The Prophet ;i;
liked the proposal of Abu Bakr ~- Some of the prisoners were
released without ransom. The Makkans sent from one thousand to
four thousand dirhams to pay for the release of their relatives. The
captives who knew reading and writing but were unable to pay
ransom were allowed freedom after teaching ten children to read and
write.
Zainab ~ , the daughter of the Prophet ;i;, sent her necklace as a
ransom for the release of Abul-As, her husband, who was also among
the captives. Allah's Messenger~ noticed the necklace and said to his
Companions, "If you think it fit, send the necklace back to Zainab, for
it was a gift from her mother Khadijah." The Companions were
pleased to accept it and released Abul-As at once. Abul-As then
hurried back to Makkah and sent Zainab ~ to Al-Madinah at once.
He accepted Islam six years [not six but three or four years] after this
event.

Revengeful Enthusiasm of the Makkan Infidels
In the wake of ignominious defeat at Badr, the Makkans held
themselves back from mourning loudly, for to them, it would be
honoring the victorious Muslims. Safwan bin Umayyah, whose father
Umayyah and son Ali were both killed at Badr, persuaded Umair bin
Wahb to go to Al-Madinah and assassinate Muhammad ;i;.
Umair arrived at Al-Madinah with a poisonous sword. Umar bin
Khattab ~ was in doubt and catching hold of him by the handle of
his sword, took him to the Prophet ~ - Allah's Messenger ~ said to
him, "What are you here for?" "I have come to seek the release of my
son who is among the captives of Badr, do mercy on me and get him
released." The Prophet ~ said, "Why don't you speak the truth that
Safwan has sent you to assassinate me?"
Afterwards he related the entire conversation held between Safwan
and Umair. Umair declared without loss of time, "I accept Islam and

)Prophet Muhammad :ff

165

bear witness that you are truly the Messenger of Allah, for our secret
~ealings were known to none except Safwan and me."
;

n the day of Badr, Allah the Almighty helped the Muslims with
is angels. The participation of angels in the battle was described by
,e
~ polytheists on their return to Makkah and by those viewing the
attle from a distance. They stated, "On the day of Badr, all of a
udden, we witnessed a piece of cloud passing over our heads
owards the battle spot. The piece of cloud was producing the
eighing sound of horses. We also heard someone say, "Hurry! Go
head." This voice struck such terror in us that a cousin of mine fell
rown dead out of fear.
~he battle of Badr being over, the Prophet ~ came back to Aladinah on Ramadan 22. This very year, during the last days of the
urrent month, Sadaqah Fitr was made obligatory and the Eid prayers
nd the sacrifice of an animal (camel, cow or sheep) were also
~njoined on the believers. The same year he married his next daughter
µmm Kulthum ~ to Uthman bin Affan ~ who came to be called
phun-Nurain (the holder of two lights), and also gave the hand of his
~oungest daughter Fatimah~ to Ali bin Abu Talib~-

t

~he flames of revenge were burning very strongly in the hearts of the
~efeated disbelievers of Makkah. Two months after the battle of Badr
/Abu Sufyan proceeded from Makkah at the head of a cavalry of two
hundred men to give battle to the Muslims. When he drew near Al/Madinah the Prophet ~ was informed and came out with a band of
'
Muslim combatants. But Abu Sufyan had already left after setting the
some date orchards on fire and killing Saeed bin Amr Ansari and his
friend who were engaged in agricultural activities.

/When Abu Sufyan heard of Muslims' arrival, the whole party took to
their heels. They were in so much of a hurry that, in order to lighten their
load, they threw away bags of food on the way. The Muslim troops gave
them a very hot chase up to Kadr and found the food lying all over.
Having abandoned the chase the Prophet ~ came back to Al-Madinah
and the event came to be known as the expedition of Suwaiq. The type of
food they abandoned is called Suwaiq in Arabic.

History of Islam

166

The Third Year of Migration
It has already been mentioned that Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was to
be installed as the king of Al-Madinah. But his plan failed as a result of
the Prophet's arrival in Al-Madinah. Because of this he fostered enmity
against the Prophet ~ and his Companions. However, he was wise
enough to keep his hateful feelings and hostile attitude a secret.
Nevertheless he entered into heinous conspiracies with the Makkans
against the Muslims. He tried hard to make the polytheists rise against
the believers but was utterly defeated in his purpose. He grew so awestricken in the wake of the victory at Badr that he apparently accepted
Islam but in truth he remained hostile to the Muslims. He also advised
all the non-Muslims to follow in his footsteps and he himself played the
role of their leader. The group of men his secret planning gave birth to,
are called the Munafiqin (hypocrites). Some Jews too joined his party
and tried to benefit from the discord.

Hostile Attitude of the Jews

The dominant position of the Muslims and the speedy spread of Islam
was most undesirable to the Jews. Their hostility had far exceeded the
enmity of Abdullah bin Ubai. They had their three strongest tribes on
the outskirts of Al-Madinah with their separate fortifications. They
were Banu Qainuqa', Banu Nadir and Banu Quraizah. The agreement
that the Prophet ~ had finalized immediately after his arrival in AlMadinah, had brought all the Jewish tribes into its fold . The Quraish
kept hatching plots with the Jews as they had been doing with !
Abdullah bin Ubai.
1

Since the Jews were antagonistic to the progress made by Islam, they
had grown sympathetic to the Quraish and their efforts to curb the
expansion of Islam. The Jews were enraged and disgruntled when
they heard from Zaid bin Harithah 4, the news of the Muslim victory
at Badr. And Ka'b bin Ashraf violently reacted to this good news and
remarked, "Woe to you! the Makkans are kings and the nobles o
Arabia. If Prophet Muhammad has won victory over them, one will
not be able to enjoy living on this earth."

Prophet Muhammad ?Jf

167

When the news of the polytheist defeat was properly verified, Ka'b
bin Ashraf left Al-Madinah and went to Makkah where he wrote
elegies for the slain and began to sing them throughout Makkah.
After igniting the fire of revenge among the Makkan disbelievers, he
came back to Al-Madinah and left no stone unturned in flaying and
decrying and mocking the Muslims.
The Jewish tribes were wealthy and practiced usury of the most
destructive nature. The Aus and the Khazraj tribes of Al-Madinah were
indebted to them and financially under their control. The Jews were
also proud of their wealth and cunning, and therefore, looked at others
as if they were foolish and ignorant. The honorable victory of the
Muslims at Badr embarrassed them. They formed new alliances with
Abdullah bin Ubai and his hypocrite followers in Al-Madinah, and the
Quraish in Makkah. Foul words and abusive language were devices
they used to soothe their mental agony. They also drew a dangerous
plan to first ask the disbelievers to profess Islam without actually
believing in it and then renounce it saying that they accepted Islam but
found that it was not a sound religion. They wanted their abandoning
of Islam to ca~e the other Muslims to turn back from their new faith
leaving behind disorder and disruption.
Now the Prophet ;I; and his Companions came across this very ugly
situation. Allah's Messenger ~ would _visit the Jewish communities and
go to their meetings and congregations to try to bring them around to
the truth and to put matters right. He said to them, "You are fully
aware of the fact that I am the true Messenger of Allah and you were
yourself awaiting the advent of a Messenger from Allah the Almighty.
It was your duty to testify to my Prophethood first before all others,
and you should have looked into your heavenly Books in order to find
the prophecies regarding me. But you are advancing on the path of
rejection and opposition; do fear the wrath of Allah otherwise you may
suffer the same ignoble death and destruction that came to men like
Abu Jahl, Utbah and the others at Badr." In response to these noble and
wise words, they would lash out at Allah's Messenger ~ saying: "The
Quraish of Makkah were unaware of the strategies of battle. We shall
teach you a lesson if and when you will face us, do not compare us
with the Quraish of Makkah."

168

History of ls/am

The Jewish Tribe-Banu Qainuqa'
The Prophet ~ put up with the highly rude treatment meted out to
him with exemplary patience and forbearance. Although these
unprincipled and haughty Jews had broken their covenant, Allah's
Messenger ~ did not like to punish them. He preferred wise
counseling and patience to their shocking rudeness and disrespectful
behavior. Finally, their extreme ill-treatment and evil doing led them
to the brink of disaster and their doom.
Once a fair was being held in the settlements of Banu Qainuqa'. A
woman from the Ansfir went there to sell milk. Following this, she
went to a goldsmith's shop to buy an ornament. The Jewish goldsmith
molested her. An Ansfiri raised his voice in support of the woman in
trouble. Jews from far and near assembled in no time and fell upon
the Muslim which resulted in his martyrdom after he had also put a
Jew to death. Other Muslims also reached the trouble spot but
suffered attacks from armed Jews. The Prophet 1i received
information in Al-Madinah. He reached there accompanied by the
Companions but found the Jews armed and ready to fight. Fighting
took place and seven hundred warriors of Banu Qainuqa' including
three hundred armored men took refuge in their fort. Abdullah bin
Salam ~ belonged to Banu Qainuqa'. The Muslims laid siege to the
fort, which continued for about a fortnight with the result they
captured the fort along with everybody inside.
In accordance with the Arabian practice, the prisoners of war would
be mercilessly put to death. The Makkans were amazed to see that
among the captives of Badr, only two were killed as a result of their
unbounded mischief and crimes. All others were left alive. Again,
when seven hundred people were captured, they were expecting
death. But Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul, the head of the hypocrites and
apparently a Muslim, interceded with the Prophet 1i for the safety of
their lives. The Prophet 1i was a little hesitant about making the
decision. At last Abdullah bin Ubai's repeated efforts materialized
and safety was granted to all the prisoners. Thus Abdullah bin Ubai
succeeded in his attempt to consolidate his friendly relation with the
Jews.

Prophet Muhammad ;ft

169

Ka'b bin Ashraf has been referred to above. He grew bold enough to
use the names of Muslim women in his love poems. The Muslims
were much aggrieved with this state of affairs. Patience on the part of
the Muslims emboldened the Jews to hatch a conspiracy for
assassinating the Prophet ~ with the result he took care while going
out at night. When the mischief of Ka'b bin Ashraf crossed all limits,
Muhammad bin Maslamah ~, a Companion took permission to kill
him. He then took a few friends with him and went to Ka'b bin
Ashraf's house and killed him. In the wake of the murder of Ka'b bin
Ashraf, another Jew, Salam bin Abul-Huqaiq took up the gauntlet and
exceeded his mischief. Since Kab bin Ashraf was killed by Banu Aus,
Banu Khazraj took upon themselves the responsibility of doing away
with his evil successor. Eight youngsters from Banu Khazraj took the
route to Khaibar, killed Salam bin Abul-Huqaiq there and escaped
safe and sound.

The Battle of Uhud, l AH
The contemptible defeat of the Makkans had infuriated them to the
exh·eme, while the Jews and the hypocrites of Al-Madinah were making
all-out efforts to light the fires of revenge. Furthermore, Hindah the wife
of Abu Sufyan, whose father and brother were killed at Badr, was doing
all she could to create a sense of shame at the ignominious defeat and loss
of pride and prestige besides the loss of precious lives. Abu Sufyan who
had achieved the status of undisputed chief after the large-scale massacre
of the Quraish chieftains, started upon massive preparations to avenge
the defeat.
The trade caravan which had returned from Syria prior to the battle of
Badr, brought a huge profit of fifty thousand Mithqiil (Mithqal is a kind of
weight equaling 4.3 gm approx.) of gold and one thousand camels. But
the goods, instead of being distributed among the shareholders, it was
decided, were to be utilized for providing weapons and armor to the
army that was burning with the rage of revenge. Poets were sent to other
tribes of Arabia and they played their role in activating people to rise up
to help the Makkans against the followers of Islam. As a result, all of
Banu Kinanah and the people of Tihamah came to their help besides
other allies of the Quraish. Ahbash (the Abyssinians residing near

170

History of Islam

Makkah) were also enlisted for the purpose. Singers of military songs and
the women were exciting the polytheist troops to strong action and were
also to be brought to the front lines. The whole year was devoted to largescale military preparations and they were aided and abetted by the Jews
and the hypocrites at all levels.
A heavily armed troop of three thousand warriors proceeded to AlMadinah at the beginning of the month of Shawwal. Wives and
daughters of the slain chieftains also accompanied the army to see
with their own eyes the spectacle of the killers being killed. Poets
were also fanning the fire of maddening anger and instigating the
soldiers to storm into the settlement of the believers with new vigor.
Hindah, the daughter of Utbah was the leader of the women's section
as her husband Abu Sufyan was at the head of the Makkan army.
Jubair bin Mut'im had an Abyssinian slave named Wahshi who was
skilled in the art of throwing lances and seldom missed his target.
Jubair bin Mut'im promised to set him free if he killed Hamzah ~'
while Hindah struck a deal with the same person that if he did away
with Hamzah ~' she would give all of her jewelry to him.
The polytheist army reached near Al-Madinah. Being informed, the
Prophet ~ summoned the Companions and asked them to give their
advice about the fresh menace. Abdullah bin Ubai (the leader of the
hypocrites), considered to be among the Muslims, was also present.
The Prophet :i was in favor of facing the enemy within the bounds of
Al-Madinah. It was also because he had recently dreamt that a little
portion of the edge of his sword had dropped and he inferred from
this that an open encounter with the enemy might cause some loss.
He had also dreamt that he had put his hand in armor. By armor he
meant Al-Madinah. Abdullah bin Ubai also supported the view of
fighting the enemy inside Al-Madinah and he felt he might have
some advantage by this. However, the majority of the Companions
favored the idea of facing the enemy outside of Al-Madinah.
Although the old ones preferred to fight from inside Al-Madinah,
the young ones differed and showed a burning desire to go out.
The 14th of Sha'ban was Friday. The consultations being over, the
Prophet ~ led the Friday prayer and then came out of his house clad

j

Prophet Muhammad ;J!i'

jin armor and armed with his weapons. Now it flashed into their
rminds that they had differed from his opinion and might, therefore,
fbe overtaken by some calamity. They submitted, "You are at liberty
to change your opinion into action and we are ready to follow suit."
But the Prophet ~ kept to the majority opinion as he had no specific
Revelation to follow. Moreover, he liked to satisfy the fervent desire
of those who were restless enough to prove their mettle in the
battlefield as they weren't able to display their valor in the battle of
Badr.
Thus, leaving behind Umm Maktum ~ in Al-Madinah, the Prophet
~ moved onward at the head of one thousand soldiers.

Mischief of the Hypocrites:
In the morning, he reached near Uhud mountain, Abdullah bin Ubai,
the wicked hypocrite, broke away with his three hundred followers
pretending that since his opinion of fighting inside Al-Madinah was
not accepted, he and his men would not take part in the battle. Now
the Muslim army consisted of merely seven hundred fighters. The
Prophet ~ had also returned the boys of young age before. Soon they
arrived at the foot of Mount Uhud. The Makkan army had already
pitched its tents there. The Prophet ;j; encamped keeping Mount
Uhud to their back. The next day, on Sha'ban 15, 3 AH, the battle
broke out.
Before the battle, the Prophet ;j; had put 50 archers under Abdullah
bin Jubair ~ at a mountainside and ordered them strictly to stay
there until further order, without leaving the place whatever may be
the condition. They were to obstruct the enemy if it comes on the
Muslims from the rear.
The Prophet ~ then drew up his troops for battle, he appointed
Zubair bin Al-Awwam ~ as the commander of the right wing and
Mundhir bin Amr ~ was given the left wing of the army. Hamzah
~ was put in as the advance guard, Mus'ab bin Umair ~ was
chosen as the standard-bearer of Islam and Abu Dujanah ~ was
fortunate enough to receive the Prophet's sword. Out of excessive joy
he marched on giving an air of vanity. Thereupon the Prophet ~

Map of

Prophet Muhammad #I!

173

remarked: "Such gestures are disliked by Allah, but it is permissible
while facing the enemy on the battlefield."
The Quraish, on the other hand, set their ranks in order and put
Khalid bin Walid (still a disbeliever) as the commander of the right
wing of their force with one hundred cavalry soldiers under his
command . Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl (still a non-Muslim) was the
commander or the left wing with an equal number of soldiers to lead.
Banu Abdud-Dar had been the standard-bearers of the Quraish army
since the long past.
In order to get them excited, Abu Sufyan told them rudely that their
performance in the battle of Badr brought them misfortune. They
should keep it and fulfill its right otherwise it would be handed over
to someone else. Banu Abdud-Dar persistently kept the standard with
them and promised to fight gallantly. The commander of the
Quraish's archers was Abdullah bin Rabi'ah. The enemy force
consisted of three thousand soldiers against seven hundred men in
the Muslim camp.

The Battle starts:
In the beginning of the battle, Abu Amir came forward . He was a
monk (belonging to the Aus of Al-Madinah) held in regard by his
people. He had settled in Makkah after the arrival of the Muslims in
Al-Madinah, and also accompanied the Makkan army to Uhud. He
had claimed in Makkah that he would certainly call the Aus to his
side right on the battleground. Thus he gave the call but was
ruthlessly rebuked by the believing Aus and he was rejected.
Following this, each side launched an attack against the other.

j Hamzah bin Abdul-Muttalib and Abu Dujanah ~ fought with such
i matchless gallantry that the disbelievers lost courage. Abu Dujanah

~ fought with the Prophet's sword killing everybody that came up
Iagainst him, and advanced deep into the enemy's ranks. Hindah bint
Utbah, the wife of Abu Sufyan was within the range of his sword at
that moment she screamed and Abu Dujanah ~ held his sword back
for he did not like that the Prophet's sword be stained with the blood
of a woman, so she was saved.

174

History of Islam

Martyrdom of Hamzah bin Abdul-Muttalib 4k,:
Hamzah ~ sprang into action with matchless valor and killed
Talhah, the standard-bearer of the polytheists. He then went deep into
the ranks killing and creating chaos and disorder. Wahshi, the
Abyssinian slave, noticed him from a distance and then hid behind
some rocks. While making a quick forward movement, Hamzah ~
came within the range of Wahshi and he flung his lance at him which
pierced him from one side to the other.
Hanzalah ~ approached Abu Sufyan by breaking the cordon around
him with his dashing charge but Shaddad bin Aswad Laithi killed
him before he could attack Abu Sufyan. Nadr bin Anas and Sa'd bin
Ar-Rabi' ~..iii proved their mettle before being honored with
martyrdom. Twelve standard-bearers of the Quraish army were killed
one by one at the hands of Muslim fighters. The Quraish standard
remained lying on the ground after the killing of Sawab, their last
standard-bearer, and none had the courage to pick it up after him . The
massive Makkan army was routed and after a gradual retreat, they
fled the field accompanied by their women who had taken a position
to encourage their soldiers to fight fiercely and fearlessly.

A Reversal:
The defeat of the polytheists and the victory of the Muslims left none
in doubt of the outcome of the fierce battle. The fleeing of the
polytheists and their standard lying on the ground for a long period
created in the Muslim archer's hearts a zest and fervor to chase the
escaping enemy. They did this in spite of their commander, Abdullah
bin Jubair ~ trying to stop them from doing so until the Prophet ~
signaled them to join the attack. Khalid bin Walid knew the
importance of that mountain pass and he therefore, lost no time in
storming into the open passage left by the Muslim archers. No one
was there to stop the forward movement of the Makkan cavalry.
Abdullah bin Jubair ~ was martyred on the spot. This sudden attack
of the polytheists created a temporary confusion in the Muslim ranks
and they stopped chasing the Makkan army.

Prophet Muhammad ;Ji

175

The chaotic condition of the Muslim ranks emboldened Ikrimah bin
Abu Jahl and Abu Sufyan to stop fleeing and they gathered their
soldiers together to launch another attack on the Muslims while they
were in a state of turmoil. Their sudden onslaught only added to the
trouble and losses in Muslim ranks.
The Muslims were surrounded by a large numbers of polytheist
fighters on different fronts. Mus'ab bin Umair • was standing by the
Prophet :i with the standard of Islam in his hand. lbn Qami' ah Laithi,
a noted fighter among the disbelievers made a violent attack and put
Mus'ab bin Umair • to martyrdom. Since Mus'ab • resembled the
Prophet :i, he thought that Muhammad :I was martyred. lbn
Qami'ah mounted a raised place and claimed that he had killed
Muhammad ~ . This news sent a wave of great joy through the ranks
of the polytheists and in a fit of rejoicing they indulged in jumping
and dancing and felt very elated and encouraged. The Muslims were
on the other hand, left shocked and stunned. Meanwhile Ka'b bin
Malik ~ saw him and exclaimed loudly, "Muslims! Be happy, for the
Prophet~ is alive and perfectly safe and sound."
Following this, the Prophet ~ called in a loud voice, "O slaves of
Allah, come to me for I am the Messenger of Allah." The Muslims rushed
to him from far and near fighting and killing the disbelievers. The
disbelievers also concentrated on the area where the Prophet~ was
surrounded by his Companions. Allah's Messenger :lj was now the
main target of the attack. Abdullah bin Shihab Zuhri struck the Prophet
~ and injured his face, while lbn Qami'ah hit his head so violently
that two rings from the metal chain strap of the helmet put on by the
Prophet ~ were driven into his cheek. Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~
pulled out the rings one by one and two of his teeth were pulled out
doing this.

Moths at the Lamp of Prophethood:
Some of the devoted Companions circled around the Prophet :i. Abu
Dujanah ~ leaned over the Prophet :i to shield him from arrows
until many were stuck in his back. Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas, Abu Talhah,
Zubair, and Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ stood like rocks to guard him
against the mounting onslaught of the enemy soldiers. Talhah •

176

History of Islam

used his hand as a shield to stop the sword attacks until it became
motionless. Ziyad bin Sakan Ansari ~ and five of his companions
were martyred protecting the Prophet ~' Amarah bin Ziyad ~ met
the same fate. Umm Amarah ~ whose real name was Nu saibah bint
Ka 'b, went following the Muslim troops just to see the spectacle of the
battle. But when the situation turned against the Muslims, she rushed to
be by the side of the Prophet :,i in those difficult and delicate moments.
When Ibn Qami'ah attacked the Prophet ~ , she rushed forward like a
flash of lightning and launched several attacks on the enemy of Islam
w ith a sword. But he remained safe beca use he was wearing a double
coat of mail. But his counter attack inflicted a d eep injury on her arm
near the shoulder.

Stability of the Prophet ~ :
During the moments when the fighting wa s going strong, some
wretched and callous person hurled a piece of stone at the Prophet ~
from a distance which injured his lip and smashed his lower tooth
and he fell on his side into a ditch. Ali bin Abu Talib~ caught hold
of his hand and Abu Bakr and Talhah ~ lent their support in helping
him out of the pit. When a small band of the Companions assembled
near the Prophet~ the enemy attack slowed down. The Companions,
emboldened by the presence of the Prophet ~ , smashed their ranks
and pushed them back. Now, he went or the nea rby mountain along
with a party of his Companions to give a. fresh call to battle from a
raised point. Abu Sufyan also tried to climb th e mountain but his
efforts were fruitless. When he made an attempt to get on a place
higher than that of the Muslims, Umar bin Khattab ~ was ordered to
fight Abu Sufyan and his band to push them back and he did it well
with the support of his fellows.
Now the Muslim troops began to gather. The scattered Muslims got on
the higher ground to be at the service of the Prophet ~, and the
disbelievers could not gather the courage to launch a fresh attack.
However, a hard-core enemy, Ubai bin Khalaf who had planned from
before to assassinate the Prophet ~ , made a bold charge at him. When the
latter noticed him moving towards him on horseback, he said, "Let him
come." He was about to make an attack when the Prophet~ took a lance

177

Prophet Muhammad -~

from his Companion, Harith bin Samma ~ and thrust it in the neck of
Ubai bin _ Khalaf, he scuttled off bewildered and embarrassed. He
succumbed to his injury on his way back to Makkah.
Abu Sufyan said in a loud voice: "Is Muhammad among you?"•"Don't
make any reply," the Prophet~ said to his Companions. ''Is Abu Bakr
among you?" he said again and got no reply. "Is Umar bin Khattab
among you?" he said and the reply was only silence. Then he said "It
seems all of them have been killed." Now Umar bin Khattab ~ broke
his silence in exasperation and answered back: "O enemy of Allah! All
are alive and you will meet your doom." Amazed to hear this he
uttered with an air of vanity: "Glory be to Hubal!" The Prophet~
asked Umar bin Kha ttab ,$ to say in reply: "Allah is the Highest and
Most Grea t!" Having heard from Umar bin Khattab ~' Abu Sufyan
said: "We have the idol Uzza, while you have none." The Prophet ti
again directed Umar ~ to say in reply: Allah is our Lord but yours
is none." Thereafter Abu Sufyan said: "This battle equalized the score
of Badr." Umar ~ replied on the instruction of the Prophet~: "No,
there is no equality at all, for those killed on our side have gone to
Paradise and those on your side are lying in Hell." He then called out,
"We shall meet again at Badr next year." The Prophet ti asked Umar
,$ to reply: "Yes, it is an appointment between us."
11

Abu Sufyan then d eparted. The Prophet ti sent Ali bin Abu Talib~
after him to witness the manner they adopted in making their
departure. If they put saddles on their camels and left their horses free
they meant to depart to Makkah; if they got on their horses and did not
saddle their camels they had a plan to attackAl-Madinah once again.
And in view of their imminent attack, the Muslims should take the
initiative in launching an attack. Ali ,$ went behind but returned in a
short while with th e news that the Makkans had left their horses free.

A View of the Battleground:
The Prophet ~ then descended from the mountain peacefully and the
task of burying the martyrs started. Sixty-five Ansar and four
Muhajirin in all were honored with martyrdom. The dead bodies of
several martyrs were torn to pieces. Hindah bint Utbah, the wife of
Abu Sufyan mutilated the body of Hamzah ~- She cut <?ff his nose

178

History of Islam

and ears and made a slit in his chest, took out the liver and chewed it
but could not swallow it. Safiyyah I$,, the mother of Zubair bin AlAwwam ~ was the full sister of Hamzah ~- When she came
forward to see her brother, the Prophet~ asked her son to send her
back so that she might not see her brother's dead body which had
been mutilated. On being forbidden, she replied, "Why? I know that
my brother has been mutilated. I have not come here for lamentation.
I shall rather keep patience and seek forgiveness for him." Having
heard this, the Prophet ;i gave her permission. She witnessed the
body and pieces of liver of her brother lying on the ground. She
exercised full-restraint and recited:
"We belong to Allah and truly we shall return to Him." (2:156)
And sought for him forgiveness of Allah and came back silently. For
Mus'ab bin Umair ~' the standard-bearer of Islam, only a piece of
coarse cloth could be found as a shroud for his burial. The cloth was
so small that when his head was covered, his feet appeared and when
his feet were covered, his head was exposed. At last, his head was
covered and some reeds were put over his feet.
All other martyrs were buried in pairs in one grave without being
given a bath. On the return from the battlefield to Al-Madinah, they
came across Hamnah bint Jahsh ~ , the wife of Mus'ab bin Umair ~She was told about the martyrdom of her maternal uncle, Hamzah ~
and she recited, "Inna lillahi wa inna i/ailzi rafi'wz." (2:156) She was then
informed of the martyrdom of her brother, Abdullah bin Jahsh, she
recited, "Inna lillahi .. ." and at last, she was given the news of the
martyrdom of her husband, Mus'ab bin Umair ~ and she burst into
tears. Hearing this the Prophet ~ remarked : "A woman loves her
husband most of all."
A woman from the Ansar, whose father, brother and husband were
honored with martyrdom, came out desperately when there was
rumor in the air that the Prophet ~ has been martyred. From AlMadinah in route to Uhud when someone said to her, "Your father
has been martyred," she asked, "Tell me, is the Prophet~ safe?" She
was moving ahead when someone said, "Your brother has been
martyred," but she said, "Tell me about the Prophet ~-" Then

Prophet Muhammad !lt

179

someone sc1id to her, "Your husband has been martyred ." But she put
the same question, "Is the Prophet ~ safe?" In the meantime the
Prophet ~ was at a little distance from her and someone pointed out
to her that he was coming. Having seen his noble face, the woman
uttered," All sufferings are insignificant if you are safe and sound."
On Abdullah bin Ubai's deserting the Muslim troops and on their
number being reduced, some of the Companions submitted to the
Prophet ~ to seek help from the Jews but he rejected the proposal.
The Jews kept waiting the outcome of the battle in their safe
dwellings. Mukhairiq, a person among the Jews told his people that
they must lend support to Prophet Muhammad ~ - "We can't fight for
this is Saturday," they replied. "This is the fighting between the
Prophet and the disbelievers, so Saturday can't stand in the way." He
took his sword and pronounced that in case he was killed, all of his
property should be given to Muhammad ~ and none should go
against him. He joined the battle and was killed.
When the Prophet ~ came to know of this, he remarked, "He was the
best of the Jews." A hypocrite named Harith bin ~uwaid accompanied
the Muslims to the battlefield . When the battle broke out, he killed
two Muslims Mujazziz bin Ziyad and Qais bin Zaid ~ and fled to
Makkah. He returned to Al-Madinah after a couple of days and was
killed by Uthman bin Affan ~In this battle, the Muslim camp found the hypocrites in their true
form and color. The next day, Sunday the 16th of Shawwal, 3 AH, the
Prophet ~ issued orders that onl y those who were present at the
~
battle of Uhud would accompany him in pursuit of the disbelievers.
So every Muslim, who had fought at Uhud the day before, followed
the Prophet ~ on his way out of Al-Madinah in spite of their fatigue
and their wounds. The Prophet ~ camped with his followers at
Hamra' Al-Asad, about 8 miles from Al-Madinah where he remained
for three days.
At Rawha', it came across the polytheists minds that they had not
won a victory. They said, "What will we say when we meet the
people without any Muslim captives and without booty? Moreover,
we are returning to Makkah in a state that our noted chieftains like

180

History of Islam

Walid bin Asi, Abu Umayyah bin Hudhaifah, Hisham bin Abu
Hudhaifah, Ubai bin Khalaf, Abdullah bin Humaid Asadi, Talhah bin
Abu Talhah, Abu Saeed bin Abu Talhah and a few others, who were
the famous chiefs of Quraish, have been killed." Pressed hard under
the demand of his men, Abu Sufyan showed his inclinatio~ to attack
Al-Madinah once again.
In this situation Ma'bad bin Abu Ma'bad passed through Rawha ' and
informed Abu Sufyan that Muhammad ~ had already came out of AlMadinah with his army and they were already at Hamra' Al-Asad.
Perhaps they will meet you very soon. With this news, great panic
and confusion gripped the polytheists and they fled straight to
Makkah for fear of their lives. Informed of the polytheists' scuttling
off to Makkah in a state of embarrassment, the Prophet ~ returned to
Al-Madinah.
This expedition is known as the expedition of Hamra' Al-Asad. This
event sent tremendous terror into the hearts of the disbelievers and
Al-Madinah was safe from another attack by this army. It is a grave
mistake to think that the Muslims were defeated in the battle of Uhud .
During the first phase of the battle, the disbelievers were routed but
the mistake of the archers led them to stage a comeback. But after
some casualties, the Muslim troops dominated the battle scene once
again and the polytheists fled from the battlefield.

The Fourth Year of Migration
A Breach of Promise and Mischief-making
On Muharram 1, 4 AH, the Prophet ~ was informed that a large
number of mischief-mongers of Banu Asad had assembled in Qatan
under the leadership of Talhah bin Khuwailid and Salamah bin
Khuwailid with the evil intent of launching an attack on Muslims. The
Prophet~ dispatched a detachment of 150 Muslim soldiers headed by
Abu Salamah Makhzumi ~ to punish them. But the enemies fled
before Abu Salamah ~ reached Qatan. The Muslim soldiers returned
with some cattle of the culprits.

Prophet Muhammad Is

181

There is a place called Uranah near Arafat where Sufyan bin Khalid
Hudhali, a hard-core disbeliever was reported to be collecting people
to attack Al-Madinah. When this news came pouring in, the Prophet
~ dispatched a detachment headed by Abdullah bin Unais. He made
it to the destination undetected and managed to cut off the head of the
leader and escape unhurt. After a long and arduous journey of
eighteen days, he returned to Al-Madinah on Muharram 23, 4 AH,
and laid the head at the feet of the Prophet :j.
ln Safar, 4 AH, by way of treachery, the Quraish of Makkah sent
seven persons from the Adal and Qarah clans to the Prophet~ saying
that their people have decided to enter the fold of Islam so some
persons should be sent to them to teach Islam. In response to the
request, he sent ten teachers (six according to lbn Khaldun) headed by
Marthad bin Abu Marthad Ghanawi ~ or Asim bin Thabit bin Abu
Aflah ~ .
When this party reached Raji', a water spot, they unfolded their
treachery and called in two hundred persons. When the Muslim party
saw itself surrounded, they moved to the top of a hill and began to
fight in self-defense. When the Muslim party could not be captured,
the disbelievers played a trick but they could seize only two while the
rest laid down their lives fighting fiercely.
Those two captured were Khubaib bin Adi and Zaid bin Dathina ~
who were taken to Makkah. These two were kept hungry and thirsty
for a couple of days in the house of Harith bin Amir. One day a little
child of Harith, while playing with a knife, drew near Khubaib ~- He
had the child seated on his thigh and put the knife aside. This horrible
sight made the mother cry in distress. Khubaib ~ pacified the woman
saying that he would never kill her child.
After a few days Safwan bin Umayyah purchased Zaid ~ to avenge
the killing of his father. The Makkans assembled to enjoy the spectacle
of Zaid's murder. From among the spectators, Abu Sufyan stepped
forward and said: "You are going to be killed in a state of hunger and
thirst. Would you like to be with your family members while
Muhammad is killed instead of you?" Zaid ~ retorted "By Allah, I
would never like to be among my family members while even a thorn

182

History of Islam

pricks my Prophet ~-" Thereupon Abu Sufyan remarked: "Nobody
ever had friends like those of Muhammad." Zaid was then put to
martyrdom. Khubaib ~ was taken by Hujair bin Abu Ihab.
Khubaib ~ was then brought for execution. He asked if he could
offer two Rak'ah of prayer. Having performed the prayer in complete
repose he said to them, "Were it not that you would think I have
delayed out of fear of death, I would have prolonged the prayer." The
executioners then sent him to his fate.

A Soul-shattering Incident
Soon after, in Safar, 4 AH, Abu Bara' Amir bin Malik bin Ja'far bin
Kilab bin Rabi'ah bin Amir bin Sa'sa'ah called on the Prophet~- He
invited him to accept Islam. But he neither confessed Islam nor
abhorred it. However, he said, "I have some concern about my
people. So let some of your people accompany me to the Najd to give
my people the rudimentary teachings of Islam "But I am
apprehensive of the people of Najd," the Prophet~ said. "You care
not about the Muslims. I shall take them under my protection," Abu
Bara' said .
The Prophet ~ sent Mundhir bin Amr Sa 'idi at the head of seventy
Companions in all. When they arrived at a well Bir Ma'unah, lying
between Banu Amir and Banu Sulaim, a letter from the Prophet ~
came to Amir bin At-Tufail through Haram bin Milhan ~- This
Amir bin At-Tufail was the nephew of Abu Bara' Amir bin Malik.
He put Haram bin Milhan to death without reading the letter. Then
he incited the people to kill the Muslims. Banu Amir refused but
Banu Sulaim's clans Ri 'l, Dhakwan and Usayyah carried out his
wish. However, Abu Bara' Amir bin Malik felt aggrieved that the
incident took place in spite of the protection provided by him. He
succumbed to his grief and died after a fortnight. Amir bin At-Tufail
took Amr bin Umayyah Darnri ~ with him as a captive. He was
then set free after his beard was shaved on behalf of his mother who
had vowed to free a slave.
He hurried to Al-Madinah and reported the event to the Prophet~While in the way he killed two men taking mistakenly as enemies. In

Prophet Muhammad ft

183

a state of profound distress, the Prophet~ invoked the curse of Allah
on the assassins, and Amir bin At-Tufail died of plague.

Faithfulness to the Promise
The two people killed by Amr bin Umayyah Darnri on his way back to
Al-Madinah, were under the protection of Muslims so their blood money
had to be paid. The Prophet~ himself went to hold consultations with
Banu Nadir concerning the blood money as they had an agreement with
the Muslims in this regard. The Prophet ~ went to the settlement along
with Abu Bakr, Umar and Ali ~ Banu Nadir apparently showed their interest in giving their share of
blood money. They seated the Prophet ~ in the shade of the wall of their
fortification and left the place pretending to collect people for the
discussion. While away from the Prophet ;I, they conspired to kill the
Prophet :I by pushing a huge stone down on his head from the top of the
fortification.

Mischief of the Jews
With this plan in view, Amr bin Jahsh bin Ka'b got on the top of the
citadel, but Allah the Almighty informed His Prophet ~ of the plot
through Revelation, with the result that he got up at once and came
back to Al-Madinah accompanied by his Companions. When the Jews
tried to call the Prophet jg; back, he rejected the offer point-blank
saying, "You hatched a plan to kill me in such and such way, so you
cannot be trusted any more." The Jews didn't even deny it nor did
they show any sense of shame.
Having arrived in Al-Madinah, the Prophet ~ wrote the Jews to
finalize another agreement but they refused it. He again wrote them
to either sign the agreement or leave the territory. But they agreed to
nothing and got ready to fight the Muslims. The Prophet ~ invaded
their territory and the Jews retreated inside their fortress . The
Prophet ~ laid siege around the fortification, which continued for a
fortnight. Abdullah bin Ubai and the hypocrites of Al-Madinah
assured the Jews of their unflinching support if they either fight or
accept an exile.

184

History of Islam

Banishment of Banu Nadir
However, the Jews conveyed to the Prophet~ through Abdullah bin
Ubai that they were ready to accept banishment provided they were
granted safety of life. The Prophet~ finally ordered them to put on
their camels as much goods and belongings as they could, except the
weapons, and leave the territory. They demolished their dwellings
and broke even their earthen vessels and jars before taking leave. One
section went to Khaibar and another one went to Syria and settled
there. The rest of the goods and property were distributed among the
Muhdjirin, except for Abu Dujanah and Sahl bin Hanif ~ ' who were
from the Ansiir, and received a share from the booty as they were
extremely poor. Yamin bin Umair and Saeed bin Wahb from the Jews
accepted Islam, so their property remained intact. This expedition is
known as the Expedition of Banu Nadir, it took place in Rabi' AlAwwal, 4 AH. This was exactly six months after the battle of Uhud.
S{irat Al-Hashr (59) was sent down during this expedition.

The Expedition of Dhat-ur-Riq,1 1
During this period, news came constantly pouring in about Banu
Muharib and Banu Tha'labah of Ghatfan tribe that they were making
large-scale preparations to wage a war against the Muslims. The
Prophet ~ proceeded to meet the enemy at the head of four hundred
Companions, appointing Uthman bin Affan ~ the administrator of
Al-Madinah. They had collected in an oasis and took to their heels on
receiving the news of the arrival of the Muslim troops. No fighting took
place. This expedition marched in Jumada Al-Ula, 4 AH . It was
named Dhiit-ur-Riqa' because the feet of the Muslim army were
injured due to making a long and arduous journey through rocky
lands and they had to wrap up their feet with rags.

Expedition to Sawiq
While departing from Uhud, Abu Sufyan had fixed the next year to
meet again on the battlefield of Badr and the Prophet ~ had accepted
the challenge. The hypocrites of AI-Madinah sent Nu'aim bin Mas'ud

Prophet Muhammad ~

I

185

to Makkah to remind the Quraish of their challenge to the Muslims of
Al-Madinah. Makkah was then in the grip of a famine. Abu Sufyan told
Nu 'aim that while he (Abu Sufyan) was making preparations for the
battle, he should go back to Al-Madinah and report the massive
preparations and readiness of the Makkans for the ensuing fight and so
fill the hearts of the Muslims with terror. This was done in hope that
they would hold back from coming out of Al-Madinah and in that way
the .battle would be defe. rred for a year. He made an offer of twenty
camels in case the job assigned to him was accomplished.

INu'aim came to Al-Madinah to do his deceitful job and began to tell of
the massive battle preparations of the Quraish. The Muslims came to the
II Prophet
~ very concerned. Umar bin Khattab ~ called on the Prophet ~
1

and submitted, "Why are the Muslims so disturbed with the news from
Makkah when you are a true Prophet of Allah?" Thereupon the Prophet
ir said, " I will go to the battlefield of Badr in accordance with my
promise even if there is not a single person to accompany me." Following
this he made preparations to give battle to the disbelievers and set out
towards Badr. An army of one thousand five hundred soldiers proceeded
under his command.

I
I

IAbdullah bin Rawahah ~ was appointed the administrator of AlMadinah and Ali bin Abu Talib ~ was made the standard-bearer of
Islam. Although Abu Sufyan wanted to avoid the battle, the coming out
of the Muslim troops from Al-Madinah forced him to proceed to the
battlefield and he came with an army of two thousand soldiers. They
were not carry anything but parched barley as provisions. The Makkans
called it the Expedition of As-Sawiq.
Abu Sufyan had managed fifty horsemen to accompany his army.
When the Makkan army reached Usfan, they found out that the
Islamic troops numbered one thousand five hundred soldiers under a
strong and solid command. They lost courage for they had already
tasted defeat at the hands of armies much less in strength during the
battles of Badr and Uhud. The disbelievers retreated with the excuse
that they thought it unreasonable to do battle during a drought. When
the Makkan army returned from Usfan, the women of Makkah
tauntingly remarked: "Have you gone to eat Sawiq? Had you
proceeded with an intent of fighting, why did you come back at all?"

History of Islam

The Prophet ~ waited for eight days at Badr but on the eighth day,
Ma'bad bin Abu Ma'bad Khuza'i gave him news that Abu Sufyan
returned from Usfan to Makkah. After receiving this information, the
Prophet ti returned to Al-Madinah. This event took place at the end
of Rajah, 4 AH. Although the Muslims didn't get any booty, they did
take full advantage of the fair, which was held at Badr during those
days. The Prophet~ came back to Al-Madinah in Sha'ban, Husain bin
Ali bin Abu Talib ~ was born the same year and wine was declared
as prohibited. Other events of the year were: the deaths of Abdullah
bin Uthman bin Affan ~' the maternal grandson of the Prophet ~,
Zainab bint Khuzaimah and Fatimah bint Usaid, the mother of Ali bin
Abu Talib. Moreover, the Prophet~ married Umm Salamah ~ after
the death of her husband, Abu Salmah Makhzumi.

The Fifth Year of Migration
On return from the second expedition to Badr the Prophet~ remained
in Al-Madinah for a period of six or seven months and nothing
significant took place during this span. In the beginning of Rabi' AlAwwal, 5 AH, the Prophet~ got the news that Ukaidir, the Christian
ruler of Dumat-ul-Jandal, had collected a massive army to invade AlMadinah and they also used to plunder the trade caravans on the way
to Syria. Since this new enemy could prove itself formidable and the
hypocrites, the Jews and other Arabian tribes around Al-Madinah
could aggravate the trouble for the Muslims, the Prophet ~ thought it
fit to stop the menace quickly. Appointing Siba' bin Arfatah Ghifari ~
the administrator of Al-Madinah, he ~ set out with an army of one
thousand soldiers. Dumat-ul-Jandal lay at a distance of five stages from
Damascus and ten stages from AJ-Madinah . A man from Banu Adhrah
was taken to show the way. During this journey they would move
during the night and rest during the day. When Dumat-ul-Jandal
remained at a distance of one night's journey, the guide said, "The
meadow of the enemy is at hand. It is better to seize their cattle." The
Prophet ~ permitted this action. Informed of the arrival of the Muslim
army, Ukaidir, the ruler of Dumat-ul-Jandal fled in a state of great
terror. The Prophet ~ halted there for a few days and dispatched
detachments to the surrounding areas but no one came to face them.

Expedition to Banu Al·Mustaliq
On return from Dumat-ul-Jandal, the Prophet ~ took to his mission of
teaching and training the Companions peacefully and singlemindedly. But, during Sha'ban, 5 AH, news came that the chief of
Banu Al-Mustaliq, Harith bin Abu Dirar was making preparations for
waging war on Al-Madinah and was also contacting other tribes to be
a party to his plan. The Prophet~ sent Buraidah bin Husaib Aslami
• on the mission of collecting information about their real intention.
He came back with the news that Harith bin Abu Dirar was bent upon
overthrowing Islam and the Muslims and he had brought many tribes
to his side.
The Prophet ~ ordered the Muslims to rise to the occasion without
loss of time. Appointing Zaid bin Harithah • as the administrator of
Al-Madinah, he moved forward at the head of an army consisting of
thirty horses, ten of the Muhajirin and twenty of the Ansar. The
Muhajirin and Ansar were given separate standards, the standard of
the Ansdr was given to Sa'd bin Ubadah • and that of the M11l11ijirin
was handed over to Abu Bakr . , while Umar bin Khattab ~ was
appointed commander of the advance guard. Since Abdullah bin Ubai
had witnessed the Muslims victorious in the past, he along with his
group of the hypocrites joined the Muslim army with a great desire for
the booty.
Since these hypocrites called themselves Muslims, they enjoyed all the
Islamic rights of a Muslim, and so, they could not be debarred from
taking part in the battles. This was the first occasion when the
hypocrites joined the Muslim camp for fighting. Harith bin Abu Dirar
had sent a spy who was caught by the Muslim troops and brought
before the Prophet ;i. When being a spy was proved beyond d oubt
and he also rejected the offer of coming to the fold of Islam, then
according to the Arabian practice he was put to death. When Harith
got the news of the killing of his spy, he felt worried and
embarrassed.
At last Umar bin Khattab ~ was ordered to go ahead and invite them
to accept Islam, and he did the job adequately. But their response was

188

History of Islam

rude and harsh. Following this, both the sides fell upon each other.
The standard bearer of the disbelievers was killed by Abu Qatadah ~
and with his fall, the disbelievers ran off. Among the captives was
Juwairiyah, the daughter of the commander of the army, besides
booty was taken in a very large quantity. Muraisi', where the battle
took place, was at a distance of nine stages from Al-Madinah.

Mischief of the Hypocrites:
On the return journey, the hypocrites made an attempt to create bad
blood between the Muhiijirin and the Ansiir. Abdullah bin Ubai
highlighted the issue of the Muhiijirin and the Ansiir. He went to the
extent that he pronounced: "When we return to Al-Madinah, those
who are worthy and noble, will drive out the unworthy wretches."
One more event that should be mentioned took place during this
journey. 'Aishah hint Abu Bakr ~ was also present on this journey.
The army made a halt at one stage when resuming the journey. Her
litter was set on the camel without her because, at the time, she was
away answering the call of nature. The man who set the litter thought
that 'Aishah ~ was inside it. She was delayed because a pearl
necklace she wore was entangled in a bush and the pearls were
scattered. Since the necklace belonged to her sister, she was more
particular about collecting them. In the meantime the army moved
off. When she returned she found nobody there. She grew very anxious.
Meanwhile, Safwan bin Mu'attal ~ emerged slowly from behind . He
was assigned the duty of looking after all the gear and as a rear guard.
Now when he came on the scene he was dumb-found ed to see the
Mother of the believers. He at once got down from his camel, and
seated 'Aishah ~ on it and moved ahead holding its halter. He
caught up with the Muslim army on the way. When they came to know
of this incident, they expressed immense sorrow over it. But the wicked
hypocrites had a gold en opportunity to capitalize on the incident and
created a storm in the Muslim camp.
Filled with tremendous despair, 'Aishah ~ went to live with her father
in such a state of gloom that the believers as a whole were thoroughly
convinced of her innocence and piety. Approximately one month after

Prophet Muhammad if

189

this _incident, Revelation came down vindicating her completely. Thus
'Aishah ~ was strongly and firmly declared as 'truthful'.
The ever expanding mischief of Abdullah bin Ubai and particularly the
latest incident became intoler?ble for the believers, and one Companion
requested the Prophet~ to do away with the scourge. But the Prophet
~ declined saying: "Since Abdullah bin Ubai outwardly proclaims
himself a Muslim, killing him will encourage some people to say that
Muhammad has now started killing his friends." When his son,
Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Ubai came to know that his father had
proved himself worthy of being killed, he called on the Prophet ?i. He
said, "Let the task of killing my father, Abdullah bin Ubai be assigned
to me so that I, by beheading him, will establish beyond a doubt that
Islam is more valuable than a father." "No, I don't want to kill
Abdullah bin Ubai," the Prophet ~ emphatically said. However,
Abdullah ~ stopped his father Abdullah bin Ubai at the entrance to AlMadinah declaring, "You are a hypocrite and I will not allow you to
enter Al-Madinah." When the Prophet ?i came to know of this, he
issued an order to let Abdullah in.

Release of the Captives:
Juwairiyah, the daughter of Harith, the chief of Banu Al-Mustaliq was
given to Thabit bin Qais ~- In the meantime Harith himself came to
Al-Madinah to seek the release of his daughter. He~ himself paid the
ransom and set her free. But Juwairiyah refused to accompany her
father and showed her eagerness to be at the service of the Prophet :I
instead. Thus he took her hand in marriage with the ready consent of
her father. In the wake of this marriage, the Companions set all the
prisoners of Banu Al-Mustaliq free saying that those entering into
relation with the Prophet~ could not be kept as captives. The spoils of
war were also given back to them. Thus enmity with a tribe was
changed into love simply because of this marriage.

Reproving the Jews:
It is a fact that the Banu Nadir had aggravated their mischievous
activities right from the day they had been banished from AlMadinah. It was only because of their nefarious plans that the

190

i

polytheists and the Jewish tribes of Arabia rose against the believers. i
The matter took such a turn that all Arabian tribes even the Christian I
forces at the Syrian frontiers began to look upon the Muslims as a l
danger to their peace and solidarity. As a result of all this, the Prophet I
~ had grown very cautious regarding their hostile activities and·never i
failed to dispatch detachments wherever danger seemed lurking.

Hua'i bin Akhtab was the biggest habitual troublemaker among Banu
Nadir who had settled in Khaibar along with the larger section of the
Jews who were banished from Al-Madinah. Hua'i bin Akhtab, Salam I
bin Abul-Huqaiq, Salam bin Mishkam and Kinanah bin Ar-Rubaiyi' I
were the prominent chieftains of Banu Nadir. They along with Hud I
bin Qais and Abu Umarah, the chieftains of Banu Wa'il, went to
Makkah and started raising funds for another battle and the Quraish I
made lavish contributions to it. After collecting huge amounts of I
wealth and exciting the people to the extreme, they went the Ghatfan
clans and played the same role there. Banu Kinanah also jumped on !
the bandwagon. Finally they made contacts with Banu Quraizah of I
Al-Madinah who were still bound to help the Muslims according to
the pact signed by both the parties. Banu Sulaim, Fazarah, Ashja',
Banu Sa'd and Banu Murrah, and the chieftains of the Quraish, Banu I
Nadir and Ghatfan that were not less than fifty in number, all went to I
I
the Ka'bah and vowed to fight against the Muslims as long as they i
lived.

They maintained great caution and tight security in view of their past !
experiences, so the Prophet ~ did not receive any news about this I
greatest conspiracy hatched against Islam until it was too late for the [
Muslims to do anything.

According to their plan, Abu Sufyan set out from Makkah at the head !
of four thousand soldiers collected from the allied tribes. At Marr-az-i
Zahran the troops of Banu Sulaim also joined the Makkan army; otheri
of their allies kept on joining on the way. Hua'i bin Akhtab was th~
chief of Banu Nadir, and the chief of the Ghatfan tribes was Uyaina~
bin Hisn, while Abu Sufyan was the commander in chief of the allied!
forces.

Prophet Muhammad 1f

191

Coming close to Al-Madinah, the total number of the allied forces
came at least to ten thousand or twenty-four thousand according to
some narratives. It consisted of four thousand five hundred camels
and three hundred horses.
When the Prophet ~ received news of their nefarious design to
invade Al-Madinah, he called a meeting to decide on how to face an
enemy with far superior numbers and weaponry. They all agreed to
fight a defensive war. Salman Parisi (the Persian)~ is reported to
have said, "When we feared a charge by the cavalry, we used to dig
trenches to keep the invaders at bay." The Prophet :i agreed to his
suggestion and decided to have a trench dug in the open ground lying
to the north of Al-Madinah.
The city was exposed only on that side and was well-protected to the
west, south and east by large plantations of date palms, volcanic
rocky plains and granite hills presenting considerable obstacles to the
progress of a mounted enemy. This was, in fact, the fort of the Muslim
troops. In the middle, the Prophet ~ pitched his camp. The trench
was dug five yards wide and five yards deep. Groups of ten persons
were each assigned the task of digging a part of the trench after equal
division of the whole area . The Prophet ~ was performing the same
work along with his loving Companions.
A large rock was causing great difficulty in digging the trench for it
could not be broken by the pick. When the Prophet :i was informed,
he dropped down into the trench and gave such a blow with the pick
that the rock was split and a glowing light came out of it. He :i said,
"Al/ahu Akbar (Allah is the Most Great), the keys of Syria have been
given to me." With the second blow of the pick, the Prophet ~ split
another portion of rock and said, "Allah is the Most Great, the keys of
Persia have been given to me." On the third attempt the remaining
portion of the rock was broken to pieces. The Prophet ~ then said,
"Allah is the Most Great, I have been given the keys of Yemen." He
then added, "Jibril the trustworthy has given me glad tidings that all
these countries will be under the possession of my Ummah."
At a time when the Muslims were making a desperate effort to save
their lives against an army of twenty-four thousand strong and when

Prophet Muhammad !ft

193

all of Arabia seemed to be thirsty for their blood, glad tidings of the
conquest of Persia, Rome and Yemen were given to the Muslims. No
one but Allah the Almighty Alone could do such a thing.
Meanwhile news came to the Prophet~ that even Ka'b bin Usaid, the
chieftain of Banu Quraizah had joined hands with the invaders and
Hua'i bin Akhtab had made a friendly entry into the citadel of Banu
Quraizah to rouse them against the Muslims. The Prophet ~ sent Sa'd
'bin Mu'adh and Sa'd bin Ubadah to Banu Quraizah to bring them
iback to their senses but in vain. In reply to the polite and sensible
approach, they very harshly replied that they knew of no Muhammad
nor did they have any commitment with him.
:When the enemy troops drew near, they exclaimed in amazement at
!the sight of the trench for it was a new experience for the Arabians.
;They laid siege of Al-Madinah. It was the most tremendous show of
military power and strength on the part of the polytheists. The
·Muslims had managed to send their women and children to a nearby
citadel. A sudden attack by the Jews, who happened to be within the
bounds of Al-Madinah, was looming large over the Muslims of AlMadinah. The hypocrites could prove even more injurious as they were
always mixing with them.
Many times the disbelievers tried to cross the trench but failed. They
inspected · the trench and, at last, found out a spot where it was
. narrowest and their horses jumped over the moat and carried their
: riders into the territory of Al-Madinah. One of these was the wellknown warrior, Amr bin Abd Wadd who was considered a match for
two thousand horsemen. Ali bin Abu Talib~ cut off his head with a
sweeping slash of his scimitar. The rest who had stormed the trench
with him darted back on their horses. Then the actual fight started
and both sides got engaged in an exchange of arrows, which would
· continue from morning till evening. This siege lingered on for about a
month, which was very difficult and troublesome. The enemy camp
was getting reinforcements from outside supporters but the Muslims
were deprived of any such help.
Once a Companion complained to the Prophet ~ of being exhausted
by hunger, and showed him his stomach on which he had tied a slab

194

History of Islam

of stone to keep himself straight and active. The Prophet ~ then
showed him his own belly on which he had tied two slabs of rock.
Since they were constantly under the fear of being sniped at by the
enemy, the Muslims used to keep guard the whole night under the
open sky besides being engaged in facing the enemy the whole day.
Mus'ab bin Qushair, a hypocrite, tauntingly remarked: 'Though the
Prophet is giving Syria, Iran and Yemen to his Companions, I see in
fact that they are now unable to even live in Al-Madinah. Some of
them used to say, "They cannot even go out to answer the call of
nature but see the dream of conquering the empires of Caesar and
Chosroes.
The Muslims were in a state of a long-drawn-out siege. They were
facing the scorching sun in the day, hunger, the lurking danger of an
enemy charge any time, and the nefarious activities of Banu Quraizah
and the hypocrites of Al-Madinah.
Mounting pressure of enemy power and strength on one hand, and
the lack of men and material on their side, the Muslims were so
determined and dauntless that whenever they were asked to accept
peace at the cost of their honor, they rejected the offer totally. Even in '
such a period of distress and desperation, noble and fortunate souls
were coming into the fold of Islam.
Suddenly one day Nu'aim bin Mas'ud belonging to the Ghatfan tribe,
came to the Prophet ~ breaking away from the enemy camp and
embraced Islam. He then said that he had a mission to sow the seed of
discord between Banu Quraizah and the Makkan army. Thus, he first
went off to Banu Quraizah and then to Abu Sufyan and talked in a
way that both of them grew doubtful of each other. As a result of this,
Banu Quraizah held back from lending any concrete and meaningful
support to the Quraish. Both the parties gave their ear and attention
to what Nu'aim ~ said to them, for his acceptance of Islam was still a
secret. When the siege had lasted over 27 days, a violent windstorm
uprooted the tents of the polytheists and overthrew their cooking
pots.
"We sent a hard gale and such an army they could not
witness." (33:9)

Prophet Muhammad.#

195

Their fires were put out in their camps and the polytheists took it as
an ill omen. The polytheists were so much overpowered by fear and
frustration that they scuttled off in the darkness of night.
Allah the Almighty Himself sent to His Prophet~ the news that the
bewildered polytheists had fled. Thereupon the Prophet :I sent
Hudhaifah bin Al-Yaman ~ to bring the news, he gave the glad
tidings that the enemy departed leaving no trace behind. The Prophet
~ remarked, "The Quraish shall not come at you after this year." The
Muslims returned to Al-Madinah overwhelmed with joy. This event
took place in Dhul-Qa'dah, 5 AH. fbn Umm Maktum ~ was
appointed the administrator of Al-Madinah in the absence of the
Muslims. On returning to Al-Madinah, the Prophet ~ halted there
only for a short while and said after offering Zuhr prayer that the 'Asr
prayer would be performed in the locality of Banu Quraizah. So, the
Muslims proceeded on to Banu Quraiza h before laying their arms
· aside.

Banu Quraizah's Breach of Trust
Sa'd bin Mu'adh ~ who had been sent to Banu Quraizah during the
Battle of Trench to bring them back to their senses, was treated rudely
by them. He was hurt by an arrow during the battle of Trench. Due to
his wound he did not join the expedition to Banu Quraizah. The
Prophet :i handed over the standard to Ali bin Abu Talib ~ and sent
him ahead as the advance guard. Hua'i bin Akhtab was present in the
fort of Banu Quraizah and was engaged in rousing them against the
Muslims. The Muslims besieged the fort of Banu Quraizah and the
: siege continued for 25 days.
The chief of Banu Quraizah was Ka 'b bin Asad. When he saw that his
people were unequal to face the charge of the Muslim troops, he
assembled them all at one place. He said, "There can be no doubt
about Muhammad being the Prophet of Allah, for our heavenly Book
carries clear and unequivocal prophecies about him and whose
advent we have been waiting for. It appears fitting that we believe in
him and thu s safeguard our lives and our property." But the Banu
Quraizah opposed this proposal tooth and nail. Ka'b bin Asad put
forward another suggestion then and said, "Kill your women and

196

History of Islam

children first and then go out of the fort and give a fierce battle. If
victory is won, women and children can be had again, and if defeated
and killed, it will be a death of honor." Banu Quraizah rejected this
offer too. Ka'b bin Asad presented a third alternative and said, "Snipe
at the Muslims on the night of Sabbath when we are not permitted to
launch any invasion or carry out killing activities, the Muslims will be
careless on this night and thus incur heavy losses." But they refused
to agree to this proposal also for they did not like to violate the
sanctity of Sabbath.
Meanwhile, three persons from Banu Quraizah named Tha'labah bin
Saeed, Asad bin Ubaid and Usaid bin Saeed, confessed Islam . A man
named Amr bin Sa'd said, "I admit that my people have committed a
breach of trust and I cannot become a party to it." Saying this he left
the fort.
At last one morning, they sent a message to the Prophet~ that they
would like to surrender on condition that Sa'd bin Mu'adh ~ was
allowed to suggest the punishment for them. He ~ accepted the
proposal. After Banu Quraizah consigned themselves to the Muslims,
the Muslim Ansar of Banu Aus called on the ~rophet ~ and
submitted: "On the eve of the battles between the Aus and the
Khazraj, Banu Quraizah would side with the Aus. You have set Banu
Qainuqa' free in accordance with the will of the Khazraj. It is our turn
now, please appoint from us a judge to decide the fate of Banu
Quraizah." The Prophet ~ said, "I have already appointed Sa'd bin
Mu'adh, the chief of the Aus to deliver his judgment about Banu
Quraizah, while Banu Quraizah has also suggested his name for the
role." Hearing this the Aus expressed utmost joy.
At the same moment they left for the Prophet's Mosque where Sa'd
bin Mu'adh ~ was undergoing treatment for his injuries. They
brought him to the Muslim troops. On the way they kept pressing
Sa'd bin Mu'adh ~ to make concession for Bam1 Quraizah. However,
he told one and all that he would do nothing but justice. When Sa'd
bin Mu'adh ~ approached, the Prophet~ asked the Ansar to get up
and pay regards to their chief. When he was told that the Prophet ~
had entrusted to him the matter of Banu Quraizah, his old allies, Sa'd
~ turned to his people and said, "Tell me by an oath to Allah that

Prophet Muhammad ;if

197

you will accept my judgment with pleasure and without any objection
to it." All of them expressed their total agreement. Sa'd bin Mu'adh
~ put the same question to the Prophet~ and the Muhiijirin, and
! they all agreed to abide by his judgment. Now Sa'd bin Mu'adh ~
i delivered his judgment: "I enjoin that all the men of Banu Quraizah be
i put to
death and their wives and children be treated like prisoners of
' war while their wealth and properties be divided among the
i Muslims." Following this judgment Banu Quraizah were ordered to
icome out of the fort and they were all brought to Al-Madinah in
icustody. At last, following the judgment, their men were killed and
their dwellings were given to the Muslims.

iJn Dhul-Hijjah, 5 AH, Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ proceeded to see
1coast area at the head of three hundred Companions under the order
:of the Prophet ~ to make an inquiry into the affairs of the Juhainah
!tribe, for distressing information was pouring in about them. Abu
1Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ and his commandos had to bear untold
miseries due to a shortage of food and drink. They had to survive on
two or three dates a day. While they were along the shore, a huge fish
jwas thrown up on the beach, which fed them for many days.
About Banu Kilab it was reported that they were determined to raid
!and plunder Al-Madinah. In the same month of Dhul-Hijjah, 5 AH,
!Muhammad bin Maslamah ~ set out with a party of thirty Muslims.
iBanu Kilab moved forward to take on the Muslims but tasted a
'sweeping defeat and took to their heels leaving behind ten dead and
!fifty camels and three thousand goats as booty.
:Similarly, Ukashah bin Mihsan ~ was sent to Makkah to look into
ithe state of affairs, while a small party was dispatched to Najd, which
ireturned to Al-Madinah with Thuma.mah bin Uthal as a captive, who
!embraced Islam wholeheartedly. He then went back to his territory,
iYamamah, and prevented the caravans from carrying food grains to
iMakkah. The people of Makkah were so hard pressed by the ban
imposed by Thuma.mah ~ that they wrote to the Prophet ~
!requesting him to get the ban lifted. The Prophet ~ asked Thuma.mah
]~ to allow the supplies of food grains to reach Makkah.

The Sixth Year of Migration
It has already been mentioned among the events occurring in 5 AH
that on the occasion of the Prophet's return from the expedition to
Dumat-ul-Jandal, Uyainah bin Hisn had requested him to allow
grazing of his camels in the meadows of Al-Madinah. He was allowed
the opportunity for one year. But that thankless fellow paid back by
raiding the pasture of the Prophet's camels, killed a man from Banu
Ghifar and carried away his wife along with the camels of the Prophet

~Salamah bin Amr bin Akwa'~ was the first to know of this incident.
He raised the alarm, collected a small band and gave them hot chase.
Salamah' s loud voice made the Prophet ~ also to go behind the
culprits. Shortly after his departure, Miqdad bin Al-Aswad, Abbad
bin Bishr, Sa'd bin Zaid, Ukashah bin Mihsan, Muhriz bin Fadalah
Asadi, and Abu Qatadah ~ followed suit and joined the Prophet ~ He appointed Sa'd bin Zaid ~ the head of the party and sent him
ahead and he himself halted at the stream of Dhu Qirad .
Salamah bin Amr ~ caught the miscreants. The pursuers were
strengthened by reinforcements, and both the parties set themselves
against one another. The Muslims captured their camels besides
regaining their own camels. They returned to the Prophet :i at Dhu
Qirad. The Prophet ~ slaughtered a camel from among the captured
ones, and left for Al-Madinah after a night's halt.
In the same year, news reached the Prophet :i that Banu Bakr had
entered into a conspiracy with the Jews of Khaibar to invade Al- !
Madinah. The Prophet~ sent Ali bin Abu Talib ~ at the head of two i
hundred soldiers to deal with Banu Bakr.
On the way, the Muslim army captured a spy of Banu Bakr who '
disclosed the concentration points of the enemy troops on a promise
of his safety. He was set free as promised. Ali bin Abu Talib 4*, made
a sudden dashing charge against the enemies and they took to their
heels after a fierce encounter. The Muslims collected five hundred
camels and two thousand goats as booty.

Preaching of Islam
In Sha'ban, 6 AH, the Prophet~ sent Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ to
the surrounding areas of Dumat-ul-Jandal to preach Islam to the
people of those areas who were still disbelievers. One of their
chieftains, Asbagh bin Umar Kalbi was a Christian. With the efforts of
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~, Asbagh accepted Islam and the majority
of the tribe followed suit. Some other chieftains, who declined to
accept Islam, got ready to pay the Jizyah (a tax levied on non-Muslims
to compensate their not taking part in armed defense of the Muslim
community). Tarnadar, the daughter of Asbagh was married to
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ and she gave birth to Abu Salamah who
rose to be among the greatest Islamic legal experts.

A Criminal Event
A few persons from Ukl and Urainah tribes who seemingly confessed
Islam, expressed their desire to settle in Al-Madinah. But, after a few
days, they complained of the unfavorable climate of Al-Madinah and
became sick. The Prophet~ sent them to the north of Uhud where his
own camels were grazing. When they became strong and stout, they
mercilessly killed Yasar, who was taking care of the camels, and .made
off with the camels. When this tragic news reached Al-Madinah, the
Prophet ~ sent Kurz bin Jabir Al-Fihri behind them with twenty
horsemen and they caught the culprits on the way and they were
returned to Al-Madinah and put to death there.

The Truce of Hudaibiyah
Although the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) ~ I was part of the culture
all over Arabia, the people had become immersed in polytheism and
idol-worship, they all still held the Ka'bah in high esteem and performed
the Hajj most regularly. They also stopped fighting during the days of
Hajj. In the month of Shawwal, 6 AH, the Prophet ti had a dream that he
was entering the Ka'bah along with his Companions. The Muslims had a
great desire to visit Ka'bah and the dream deepened this urge. The
Prophet ~ decided to visit the Ka'bah to perform Umrah (the lesser

200

History of ]slam

pilgrimage) and he left Al-Madinah for Makkah in Dhul-Qa'dah, 6 AH,
with one thousand four hundred Companions and seventy sacrificial
camels. They were all in Ihram. Coming as pilgrims symbolized their
peaceful intentions and the Makkans also had no right to prevent the
Muslims from visiting the Ka bah.
Having arrived at Dhul-Hulaifah, the Prophet '.!i sent as a precaution
a man from the Khuza'ah tribe to check the situation. He came back
and informed the Prophet ~ that the Quraish had collected a large
number of people to stop the Muslims from reaching the Ka'bah. The
Prophet ~ consulted the Companions. Abu Bakr~ said, "We have
come here for performing Umrah and not for fighting. But, if someone
stands between the House of Allah and us, then we must fight against
them." . Having heard this, the Prophet '.!i ordered the Muslims to
proceed on. The Quraish had already sent Khalid bin Walid with a
squad of cavaliers to Kura' Al-Ghamim to stop the movements of the
Muslims towards the Ka'bah. The Prophet '.!i took a route towards the
right evading the main route and all of a sudden, they passed western
side of Khalid bin Walid . Now he, frightened to the extreme, galloped
off on his horse to Makkah to update them of the imminent danger at
hand. The Prophet '.!i, on the other hand, reached the hilly range
below which starts the surrounding areas of the city of Makkah. His
dromedary sat down there. The people around remarked: "The
dromedary has played foul." Thereupon the Prophet '.!i retorted, "The
dromedary has not played foul, but she is prevented by the One Who
has prevented elephants to enter the city."

Position of Hudaibiyah:
The Prophet '.!i did not think it proper to launch an attack on Makkah
and the House of Allah for those were the areas where fighting was
prohibited by Allah. He ~ then chided the dromedary and it got up
and moved on. The Prophet '.!i halted at the well of Hudaibiyah. The
well was deficient in water which ran short in no time. When the
people were on the brink of facing trouble, the Prophet~ took out an
arrow from his quiver and gave it to Bara' bin Azib ~ to drop it in ,
the well. With the dropping of the arrow, water in the well flowed in
such a great quantity that the Muslim army no longer had a scarcity.

. Prophet Muhammad :flt

201

· When the Prophet ~ got set at Hudaibiyah, Budail bin Warga'
Khuza'i came with a number of men and asked the purpose behind
the arrival of the Muslims. He ~ said, "Don't you see the rows of
sacrificial camels ahead of the caravan and notice us in Ihriim?"
Hearing this he went away and said to the Quraish, "You are
unnecessarily raising an alarm about Muhammad. He has come here
with the sole intention of visiting the House of Allah, not for fighting
with you." The mischievous among the Quraish said, "We fiU~oJ
allow them to come here even as pilgrims." But the wiser ~
began to think in silence.
Then they sent Hulais bin Algamah Kinani, the chief of Ahabish tribes
(tribes around Makkah) as their envoy. But he returned only after
witnessing the sacrificial camels without even approaching the
Prophet ~ and said to the Quraish, "The Muslims have come here not
l for fighting but to perform Umrah, and none has the right to prevent
them from doing this." Hearing this the Quraish remarked, "You wild
man, you know nothing, we shall never allow the Muslims to enter
Makkah, otherwise Wf will be disgraced." Hulais fell in anger and
said, "If you keep the Muslims away from performing Umrah, we will
fight against you with all our men." In response to these activities, the
Prophet ~ sent Khirash bin Umayyah Khuza'i with the message that
they had come not for fighting but to perform Umrah and to sacrifice
their animals. The Quraish slaughtered the camel of Khirash and
attempted to kill him as well. But Hulais and his men saved him and
returned him safely. Following this a group of headstrong youngsters
came out of Makkah with a plan to launch a sudden attack on the
Muslims. They were all caught but were released later on by the order
of the Prophet ~ .
He ~ then wanted to send Umar Farug ~ to the Makkans.
Thereupon Umar ~ submitted, "I have no objection in going there
but none of my tribe Banu Adi bin Ka'b is in Makkah to take me
under their protection. My visit may land me in trouble, Uthman bin
Affan is a better person to do the job, for a large number of powerful
and influential people of his tribe Banu Umayyah are still in
Makkah." This suggestion was appreciated by the Prophet~ and he
sent Uthman bin Affan ~ to Abu Sufyan as his envoy. He came

202

History of Islam

across Aban bin Saeed bin Al-As as he entered Makkah, Aban took
him under his protection without loss of time and took him to Abu
Sufyan and the other chieftains of the Quraish. Having heard from
Uthman ~ the message of Prophet ~ they said, "We give you
permission to go around Ka'bah." Thereupon Uthman .:.$, said, "I
can't circumambulate alone without the Prophet ;I." Hearing this the
Quraish grew angry and held him back in Makkah.

The Pledge of Ridwan:
When the return of Uthman ~ was delayed, a rumor spread ·among
the Muslims that he was martyred. Hearing this the Prophet~ said
with determination, "We shall not leave this place without avenging
the murder of Uthman." Thus he~ sat down under a tree and took
oath from all his Companions on sacrificing their lives for this cause.
The Noble Qur'an says referring to this event:
"When the believers took the oath at your hand (0 Messenger)
Allah the Almighty grew happy with them." (48:18)
But Uthman ~ came back from Makkah after a short while. Although
the sober and saner section of the Quraish disliked fighting, the
majority opinion persisted in favor of fighting and killing. But finding
the Muslims ready to do battle, their belligerent attitude also softened.
Thus the Makkans sent Urwah bin Mas'ud, the chief of Banu Thaqif to
the Prophet~- He came and said, "O Muhammad! All the clans of the
Quraish are determined to give you battle. The people who are now
lending you their support, will scurry off leaving you alone for they
are unable to stand the onslaught of the Quraish."
Abu Bakr ~ answered him back so violently that he kept silent. The
Prophet ~ said to Urwah, "We have not come here with the intention
of fighting but with a desire to perform Umrah. But, if the Makkans
are bent upon fighting, I shall fight with them to fulfill the duties of
m y Prophethood till my head is separated from body or Allah the
Almighty Himself decides the matter. If the Makkans so desire, l am
ready to finalize a truce with them provided they let us d o our
preaching work, or accept Islam to do away with the fi ghting for
ever."

Prophet Muhammad at

203

Deep Love of the Companions for the Messenger ~:
During his conversation with the Prophet~, Urwah was again and again
stretching his hand up to the beard of the Prophet :i. Mughirah bin
Shu'bah ~ became displeased at this gesture and by hitting his hand
with the handle of his sword, asked him to behave. When he went back
to the Quraish he said, "O people of Quraish! I have been to the
magnificent royal courts of Rome and Persia, but nowhere did I witness
any ruler so dear to his people as Muhammad is to his followers. His
Companions have such a deep love and high regard for him that when
he performs ablution, they struggle to get the water he has used and
don' t even let it fall on the ground. If he speaks, everybody listens to him
with rapt attention, nobody even dares to look straight into his eyes. They
can't leave Muhammad at any cost. Accept what Muhammad has
explained to you, and strike a peace deal with him." Following this the
Quraish sent Suhail bin Amr with the power of attorney to make a
compromise only on the condition that Muhammad~ gives his consent
to return back this year with his men only to come next year to perform
Ummh . As soon as the Prophet ~ saw Suhail coming, he said, "The
matter has now become easy since they have sent this man, it seems they
want peace." Suhail put the terms of the treaty and the Prophet ~
accepted them as a whole. He~ then summoned Ali~ and asked him
to prepare a draft of the agreement. Ali~ wrote Bismillahir-RahmanirRnhim (In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful) at the
head of the document. Objecting to it Suhail said, "We do not recognize
Rahman (the Most Gracious), but write Bismika Allahummn (In Your
Name, 0 Allah), as the custom goes." The Prophet~ said, "Well, let it
be." When Ali ~ wrote the name of the Prophet, 'Muhammad, the
Messenger of Allah', Suhail again protested and said, "Had we witnessed
that you were the Messenger of Allah, we would not have turned you
away from the House of Allah nor fought with you. You should write
'Muhammad bin Abdullah'." "I am Allah's Messenger even if you
disbelieve in me," replied the Prophet ~ and asked Ali ~ to rub out
what he had written. "By Allah, I cannot do it," replied Ali ~- The
Prophet ~ asked Ali ~ to point out the place to be rubbed out. Ali ~
pointed it out to the Prophet :i who expunged it.

204

History of Islam

Conditions:
The following were the conditions of the Treaty:
1. The Muslims will perform Umrah next year instead of this year.

While entering Makkah they will carry no arms except their
swords, and that too being sheathed. Moreover, they will not stay
in Makkah for more than three days.
2. The Treaty will remain valid for a period of ten years. And nobody
from any side would lift their hand against the other for the
duration.
3. Every tribe or clan of Arabia will enjoy the right to enter into
agreement with any party of its choice; but the allies will have to
observe the terms and conditions of the Treaty in letter and spirit.
4. If anyone from the Quraish comes over to the Prophet~ without
obtaining the permission of his guardian, he will be returned to his
guardian, but if anyone of those with the Prophet ~ escaped to the
Quraish, they are not bound to be returned to him.

Reaction to the Peace Treaty:
The fourth condition of the Treaty was terribly displeasing to the
Companions. The Treaty was still being written when Abu Jandal ~ '
the son of Suhail himself, who was put in chains and mercilessly
tortured for professing Islam, came to the Prophet ~ from his
captivity. He showed fresh injuries on his person and expressed his
profound desire to be taken to Al-Madinah. Suhail cried in
excitement, "Abu Jandal should be handed over to me as per the
Treaty." The Prophet ~ tried to drive the point home to Suhail but he
would not agree. At last, Suhail took Abu Janda! ~ back to Makkah
beating him severely.
Umar ~ witnessed the pitiable sight and lost control over himself. He
then appeared before the Prophet~ and said, "O Messenger of Allah!
Are you not a true Prophet?" "Certainly! I am a true Prophet," the
Prophet ~ replied. "Are we not believers?" "Certainly! You are
believers," the Prophet ~ said in reply. "Are they not polytheists?"

Prophet Muhammad .#

205

Umar ~ submitted again. "Certainly! They are polytheists," the
Prophet ~ said. "Why are we then accepting such ignominious
terms?" Umar ~inquired.The Prophet ~ said, "I am the Messenger
of Allah and therefore, cannot oppose the Command of Allah, nor can
I commit any breach of trust. He (Allah) will never put me to
disgrace." Hearing this Umar's anger subsided and he repented very
deeply for his being so bold with the Prophet~ and kept on seeking
forgiveness of Allah and setting slaves free to atone for his behavior.

Unique Victory:
Having concluded the Treaty, the Prophet :i and the Muslims
sacrificed the animals at Hudaibiyah, put off their Ihrdm and shaved
their heads. After this Treaty, the Khuza'ah tribe formed an alliance
with the Prophet ~ and the Banu Bakr tribe formed an alliance with
the Quraish of Makkah. The Khuza'ah and Banu Bakr were at odds
with one another for quite a long time. Since each of them, formed an
alliance with one party or another, they had to be at peace with each
other according to one of the conditions of the Treaty. When the
Prophet ~ was returning from Hudaibiyah to Al-Madinah, Surat AlFath (The Victory) was revealed on the way. Now what the
Companions took as a setback was, in fact, a unique victory. Very
soon the Companions saw with their naked eyes that the seemingly
weak terms from the Muslim point of view proved very strong and
useful. The greatest victory for the Muslims was the condition of
peace which the Muslims secured through this Treaty, which paved
the way for the spread of Islam so quickly that could not have been
possible in a state of fighting and disorder. Islam means peace and it
has so often gone to war to establish peace. Battles in Islam have
always been fought for winning peace. Thus in only two years after
the Truce of Hudaibiyah, enjoying a state of peace, the number of
believers doubled.

Consequences of the Truce of Hudaibiyah
The fourth condition of the Treaty was as an irritant of the highest
degree. This condition was repulsive to the Muslims, however, the
Quraish eventually requested the Prophet :i to cancel this condition

206

History of Islam

which seemingly was in their favor. The following events will explain
what caused this surprising change. A few days after the return of the
Muslims to Al-Madinah, Abu Basir, who had already confessed Islam
in Makkah, broke away and took shelter in Al-Madinah. The Quraish
sent two of their men to bring Abu Basir ~ back to Makkah
according to the recently signed Treaty. The Prophet~ sent him back.
At Dhul-Hulaifah, he, according to a plan, said to one of his guards,
"Your sword appears to be of the highest quality." Hearing this,
another guard unsheathed the sword of his fellow and began to
admire it. Abu Basir ~ said, "Let me see the sword." He gave it to
Abu Basir ~ without the least care.
Abu Basir ~ struck him with the sword so hard that his head came
off and fell down. The other guard took to his heels towards AIMadinah and entered into the Prophet's Mosque frightened, and
narrated the incident to the Prophet ~- He was still reporting the
event when Abu Basir ~ came in following him with the unsheathed
sword. When he was sure he wouldn' t get any protection in AlMadinah, Abu Basir ~ said to the Prophet ~: "You have already
fulfilled your duty by handing me over to the polytheists, but Allah
the Almighty caused me to restore my liberty. 1 will now go away
because you will, in fulfillment of your agreement, give me to the
polytheists again." Saying this he left the place. The man from the
Quraish returned to Makkah and related the incident to them.
Abu Basir ~ fled to the seacoast and settled at Eis. When Abu Janda)
bin Suhail ~ came to know of this, he also escaped from Makkah and
joined Abu Basir ~- Now, whoever embraced Islam in Makkah fled
from there to join the band of Abu Ba sir~- The band grew so strong
that it began to intercept the trade caravans of Makkah. Things got so
bad that the Quraish wrote to the Prophet ~ to abrogate the fourth
condition of the Treaty, and they would no longer demand the return of
those who escaped and went to him in future .
The Prophet :I accepted the request of the Quraish and sent a
message to Abu Basir ~ to come to AI-Madinah along with his band
of men. This order reached Abu Basir ~ at a time when he was
seriously ill and confined to bed. However, he called Abu Janda!~
and instructed him to carry out the command without loss of time.

Prophet Muhammad Ji

207

Abu Basir ~ then passed away and Abu Jandal ~ left for AlMadinah accompanied by his fellows. This is how the despised fourth
condition of the Treaty was mutually canceled.

Return of the Muslims from Abyssinia
On return from Hudaibiyah, the Prophet ~ sent Amr bin Umayyah
Damri ~ with a letter addressed to Negus, the King of Abyssinia, to
bring Ja 'far bin Abu Talib 4}¢ and all other Muslim migrants back to
Al-Madinah. Through this dispatch, the Prophet~ had also invited
Negus to accept Islam, which he did at once. He bade farewell to the
Muslims with many valuable gifts. From Hudaibiyah, the Prophet ;I
reached Al-Madinah in Dhul-Hijjah and stayed in Al-Madinah till
Muharram, 7 AH. Towards the end of 6 AH, the Prophet :i
introduced among the Muslims the practice of racing camels and
horses. It is said that Aishah' s mother died the same year and Abu
Hurairah ~ embraced Islam.

The Seventh Year of Migration
Conquest of Khaibar
After the Truce of Hudaibiyah, the Prophet~ obtained peace with the
Makkan polytheists. However, news came to Al-Madinah that there
was a plan to launch an attack on Al-Madinah. Being uprooted from
Al-Madinah, Banu Nadir and Banu Qainuqa' were staying in Khaibar
and the flames of revenge were burning in their hearts, and very soon
the Jews of the region were incited to rise up against the Muslims.
Khaibar became the center of hostility against the Muslims. They
started large-scale military preparations against the believers. They
drew Banu Ghatfan to their side by promising them half of the
produce of Al-Madinah.
The Jews had the support of the hypocrites of Al-Madinah and even
though they were far away from Al-Madinah, they knew of every
move the Muslims were making. Informed of their military
preparations, the Prophet ~ marched towards Khaibar in Muharram,
7 AH, at the head of one thousand five hundred Companions leaving

208

History of Islam

Saba' bin Arfatah ~ m Al-Madinah as Administrator. He :i chose
Raji', a region lying between Khaibar and Banu Ghatffm, to serve as
his military camp, with the result Banu Ghatfan who kept fearing a
Muslim attack at any time, could not dare go to help the Jews of
Khaibar.
In Khaibar, there were three settlements in which the Jews had a
cluster of six big forts. They had among them fighters like Marhab
and Yasir who were wrestlers of repute. They stepped forward and
made a challenge for a duel. Muhammad bin Maslamah and Zubair
bin Awwam ~ accepted the challenge. After a fierce fight, Maslamah
~ killed Marhab and Zubair bin Awwam ~ slew Yasir. As per some
narratives, Ali~ was the man who had killed Marhab.
Finding it almost impossible to face the Muslims in the open, the Jews
stayed in their forts. The Muslim army launched an attack on the fort
called Na'im which belonged to Marhab and captured it. The next fort
to be captured was Sa'b bin Mu'adh. Then attack was made on the
second settlement of Khaibar. Its forts were also captured. Now came
the Qamus, fort of Abu Huqaiq in the third settlement, it also fell.
Safiyyah bint Hua'i was brought to Al-Madinah as a captive and the
Prophet :i married her after setting her free.
Watih and Salalim were the two remaining forts that came under
siege by the Muslim troops, which continued for ten days. They
obtained peace and safety from the Muslims on giving half of the
produce from their lands and gardens.
During the battle of Khaibar, fifteen Muslims were honored with
martyrdom, four from the Muhtijirin and eleven from the Ansar, while
39 Jews were killed. Zainab bint Al-Harth, the wife of a Jewish
chieftain, Salam bin Mishkam served the Prophet :i a poisonous
roasted goat. As he took a piece of it, he spat saying that the bones
were giving information about the poison. Bishr bin Al-Bara' ~ who
was sharing the meal, had taken a piece of meat and swallowed it
which led to his immediate death. Zainab was called and she
confessed her crime. She was handed over to the relatives of Bishr ~
but they held back from killing her as she had already accepted Islam.
According to another narrative, she did not embrace Islam and was
killed in retaliation. Preparations to set out for Al-Madinah were still

1

Prophet Muhammad !Jf

209

· on when some migrants of Abyssinia appeared before the Prophet ti
along with the valuable gifts and a letter from Negus, the King of
Abyssinia. Their caravan included Ja'far bin Abu Talib, his wife,
Asma' bint Umais, his sons Abdullah, Aun, and Muhammad, Khalid
bin Saeed bin Al-As bin Umayyah, his wife, Aminah bint Khalaf, and
i his son, Saeed ~ - While Umm Khalid, Amr bin Saeed, Abu Musa
; Ash'ari, Jahm bin Qais, Harth bin Khalid, Muhinah bin Ghidar,
i Ma 'mar bin Abdullah, Abu Hatib bin Amr, Malik bin Rabi'ah bin
Qais and Amr bin Umayyah Damri ~ were those who had gone to
bring them back. Some of them went to Al-Madinah and the rest
i arrived in Khaibar.
On the way back in the eastern side from Khaibar, there lay the
flourishing town of Fidak. The Jews of Fidak sent a message to the
Prophet ti; to take away everything in lieu of their lives. The request
was accepted. Since Fidak came under possession without a fight, the
property was given to state control as the sole property of Allah and
His Messenger. When the Muslim army passed by Wadi-ul-Qura, the
Jews of the area began to shoot arrows at the Muslims. They were also
besieged and they earned peace and safety at the cost of half of their
produce. The people of Taima also obtained peace like those of Wadiul-Qura.

After the Conquest of Khaibar
On way back from Khaibar, one morning the Prophet ~ and the entire
Muslim army slept past sunrise. It was the Prophet~ who got up first
and roused the others from their sleep. At a little distance from there,
he ~ and his Companions offered the Fajr prayer. Thus he ti; showed
the Companions the offering of the prayer when rising late from the
sleep.
The Jews were very wealthy and the lands of Khaibar under their
possession were also very fertile. After the conquest of Khaibar, the
booty and agricultural lands distributed among the Muslims removed
their poverty and hardship. Now the Muhdjirin became owners of
property and became free from the need for help and support of the
Ansdr. From the lands of Khaibar, the Prophet ti received the
property of Fidak, which served the purpose of caring for the many

210

History of Islam

visiting delegations and his other guests, while the land from Banu
Nadir sustained his relatives, the orphans and the poor.

A very wealthy man from Makkah, Hajjaj bin Ilat Sulami, left Makkah
telling everyone that he was going on a journey but he actually went
to the Prophet :;I and he became a Muslim in his presence and joined
the Prophet :;I during the expedition of Khaibar. He said, "The
Makkans are still unaware of my conversion to Islam. With your
permission, may I go to Makkah and bring my wealth, which is.-in the
possession of my wife and collect the money I have' given as loans to
the Makkans?" The Prophet :I granted him permission. When Hajjaj i
~ went to Makkah, he found that the Makkans desperately wanted
to know about the outcome of the Muslims action in Khaibar. Hajjaj
~ used this event to deceive the disbelievers. He told them nothing
about the consequences of the battle of Khaibar and utilized their
support in collecting his loans, they considered it a support for a
fellow enemy of the Muslims. He then set out from Makkah with his
entire wealth after collecting the whole amount that was outstanding,
he only informed Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib about his accepting Islam
and the conquest of Khaibar by the Muslims. The Makkans were angry
and depressed at the success of the Muslim military action in Khaibar
and Hajjaj's escape from Makkah with such a vast amount of wealth.

On his return from Khaibar, the Prophet ~ sent detachments to all
those tribes who were still making efforts to inflict harm on the
Muslims. The purpose behind sending those detachments was to send
terror into their hearts so that any conspiracy would be prevented
before it was put into action. Abu Bakr~ along with Salamah bin
Akwa' ~ and others were sent to the Fazarah tribe, while Umar ~
was dispatched to the Hawazin at the head of thirty horsemen.
Abdullah bin Rawahah ~ was sent to arrest Bishr bin Zaram, the Jew
who used to incite the Jews of Khaibar against the Muslims. Bashir
bin Sa'd Ansari ~ set out at the head of thirty horsemen to punish
Banu Murrah, while Usamah bin Zaid ~ went to the clan Huraqah
(Banu Humais) of Juhainah tribe. Cha.lib bin Abdullah Laithi ~ was
sent to Banu Al-Mulawwih, and Abu Hadrad Aslami ~ was sent to
Rifa'ah bin Qais, the chief of the Jusham bin Mu'awiyah clan . Abu
Qatadah and Muhallim bin Jaththamah ~ were sent to Idam.

Prophet Muhammad Jff

211

All these military detachments came back with success. Usamah bin
Zaid ~ lifted his sword to kill a person who immediately
pronounced La ildha illallah (there is no God to be worshipped except
Allah), despite this, Usamah ~ put him to death. When the matter
was later reported to the Prophet :i, he asked Usamah ~ to explain
his action. He submitted that he had killed him because he had
pronounced the Shahadah just to save his life. "Did you split his heart
to see if he had pronounced the Shahddah out of hypocrisy?" The
Prophet ~ angrily expressed himself. Usamah ~ expressed his
utmost regret over his behavior and promised not to repeat it again.
In the same way, Abu Qatadah and Muhallim bin Jaththamah ~
were once going somewhere when they came across Amir bin Adbat,
a man from Ashja' clan who was making a journey with his goods.
When Amir bin Ad bat noticed the Muslim detachment, he said "AsSalamu Alaikum" in the Islamic manner. But the Muslims doubted his
sincerity and Muhallim bin Jaththamah ~ put him to death. When
the expedition returned, the incident was reported to the Prophet :i,
he expressed his displeasure and said to Muhallim ~, "Why did you
kill him in a state of his being a believer in Allah?" Then he :i gave
the relatives of Amir, fifty camels as compensation and they agreed to
free Muhallim ~ from retaliation.

Invitation Letters to Islam
In this same year, the Prophet ~ sent letters to the kings of the Arabs
and non-Arabs. His letter to Negus, the King of Abyssinia has already
been mentioned. Negus accepted Islam gracefully. Then the Prophet
~ sent Dihyah bin Khalifah Al-Kalbi ~ to Heraclius, the king of
Rome; Hatib bin Abu Balta'ah ~ to Muqauqis, the king of Egypt and
Alexandria; Ala bin Al-Hadrami ~ to Mundhir bin Sawa, the king of
Bahrain.
Amr bin Al-As ~ was sent to the king of Oman; Salit bin Amiri~
was sent to Haudhah bin Ali, the king of Yamamah; Shuja' bin Wahb
~ to Harith bin Shimr Ghassani, the king of Damascus, and also to
Jabalah bin Aiham. Muhajir bin Abu Umayyah Makhzumi ~ was
sent to Harith bin Abd Kulal Himyari, the king of Yemen; and
Abdullah bin Hudhaifah Sahmi ~ to Chosroes, the king of Persia.

212

History of Islam

Heraclius, the king of Rome did not embrace Islam fearing the
opposition of the Christians and the loss of the throne, but he paid
respect to the letter of the Prophet ~ and his messenger. The King of
Egypt held the letter and the envoy of the Prophet ~ in high esteem.
In reply he wrote a very courteous letter to the Prophet ~ and sent
garments, a donkey and two slave-girls to him. Mundhir bin Sawa
also showed respect to his letter and the envoy. The king of Oman
embraced Islam when he received his letter. However, Chosroes, the
King of Persia, tore the letter into pieces and behaved rudely with
Abdullah bin Hudhaifah ~ - Informed of this, the Prophet ~
remarked, "Even so shall Allah shatter his kingdom to pieces." And it
happened exactly as he said.

Arrival In Makkah
The Prophet ~ in the early part of Dhul-Qa'dah, 7 AH, asked only
those Companions who had taken part in the Treaty of Hudaibiyah to
make preparations for the journey to Makkah. Two thousa nd
Companions in all, left for Makkah. Abu Dhar Ghifari ~ was
appointed the Administrator of Al-Madinah. According to the Treaty,
they took off all their weapons except their swords and entered
Makkah.
Reaching the Ka'bah, the Prophet ~ asked the pilgrims to lay bare
their right shoulder and wrap a part of the Ihram passing it from
below the armpit, and then go around the House of Allah in a
running manner. He did this so that their readiness, determination,
strength and diligence would come in to full view of the onlooking
Makkan polytheists. A large number of polytheists had shifted to
mountain passes and plains to avoid the sight of the believers
performing Umrah, which would be distressful for them.
After accomplishing the rites of Umrah, the Prophet ~ married
Maimunah ~ , the sister of Umm Fadl and the wife of Abbas bin
Abdul-Muttalib. The fourth day, Suhail bin Amr and Huwaitib bin
Abdul-Uzza came to the Prophet~ and asked him to vacate Makkah
as per the Treaty. He said, "Don't worry, Jam ready to leave Makkah.
But you are quite aware that I have just married a woman here and
the bride has not yet been sent to me. If you allow me, J will have a

Prophet Muhammad 3if€'

213

marriage party and invite all the Makkans to a feast before leaving the
city. I think you will lose nothing if it is done." Suhail said, "We need
no feast or your party, and you should go from here observing the
terms of the Treaty." So, the Prophet~ proclaimed their departure
then and there. The Prophet~, along with his Companions, came out
of the Haram (sacred) area and halted at Sarif valley, Maimunah bint
Harith ~ joined the Prophet ~ there.
On the eve of leaving Makkah, Umarah, the daughter of Hamzah ~'
who was still a young child, came running and crying to go to AlMadinah. Ali~ lifted the child and put her on his saddle. Now Ja'far
bin Abu Talib and Zaid bin Harithah also rose to make a claim saying,
"Since she is my cousin and my wife is her mother's sister, she must
be given under my care." The Prophet~ patiently heard all the claims
and then entrusted the child to Ja'far saying, "The mother's sister is
like the mother, so she shoul<l°be brought up under the loving care of
Ja'far' s household." Ali and Za1d ~ abided by this decision.

Amr bin Al-As accepts Islam
A few days after the arrival of the Prophet ~ to Al-Madinah, Amr bin
Al-As embraced Islam and decided to migrate from Makkah. It has
already been discussed how he was sent to the Court of Negus, the
king of Abyssinia to bring back the Muslims who had migrated to
that country and how his efforts failed leaving him ashamed and
disgraced . In spite of all that, the truth of Islam deeply impressed his
mind and his old beliefs were getting eroded bit by bit. And a time
came when he could not hold himself back. Khalid bin Walid was his
close friend. On the occasion of Hudaibiyah, he (Khalid) had an
opportunity to hear the Prophet ~ reciting the Qur'an in Isha prayer
at Usfan and he found his heart melting and growing in love for
Islam. Amr bin Al-As opened his heart to Khalid bin Walid, and the
latter one rose without any reluctance to accompany him. The two
friends acquainted Uthman bin Talhah, their third friend with their
intention. He also lost no time in joining the two. These three
chieftains of Makkah set out for Al-Madinah, they appeared before
the Prophet ~ and embraced Islam immediately. Their conversion to
Islam gave a tremendous boost to the Muslims. When Khalid bin Walid

History of Islam

214

and Amr bin Al-As ~ came to know that embracing Islam brings
forgiveness for all past sins, their joy knew no bounds.

The Eighth Year of Migration
Arabia was now apparently out of any grave danger. The act of
accepting Islam posed no danger to life and property. Negative
internal forces of all types had exhausted their spirit of opposition and
their strength fighting Islam. Islam had itself become the greatest
power within the bounds of Arabia. However, the Quraish of
Makkah, who once wielded matchless honor and distinction, were
still active in their opposition to Islam and in practicing unbelief and
polytheism.
The hypocrites of Al-Madinah, the Jews of Khaibar and the
polytheists of Makkah were the three forces who had left no stone
unturned to set Arabia against the Muslims, but their efforts ended in
failure. Now they turned towards Persia and Rome and started
inciting them against the believers. However, the Prophet ~ was not
unaware of their conspiratorial aims. The communications sent by the
Prophet ~ to the various monarchs had left a salutary effect on most
of them. But, a few whose minds were permeated with poisonous
propaganda showed rudeness to the call of the Prophet~ and set
themselves against Islam. It was a very delicate situation for the
Muslims, because in case of a foreign invasion, the Arab forces
antagonistic to Islam might rise against the believers.

The Expedition to Mu'tah
Among the letters written by the Prophet ~ to the different monarchs,
one was addressed to the ruler of Busra and was sent through Harith
bin Umair Azdi ~- On the way to Busra, Harith ~ had just reached
Mu'tah lying on the border of Syria, when Shurahbil bin Amr
Ghassani, a deputy of the Byzantine Emperor held him. When he
came to know that the captive was the envoy of the Prophet~ and
was carrying a letter from him, he lost his temper and killed him. This
tragic news sent the Muslims into a state of outrage. The Prophet~
lost no time in sending an expedition of three thousand soldiers under

Prophet Muhammad ~

215

the command of Zaid bin Haritha ~ - He instructed them that if Zaid
~ were killed then Ja 'far bin Abu Talib~ should take the command.

If Ja'far ~ were also slain then the command would pass on to
Abdullah bin Rawahah ~' and in case of his falling the Muslims
were at liberty to choose anyone as their commander. The Prophet~
escorted the army for a distance and then returned to Al-Madinah.
Zaid bin Harithah ~ led his force to Ma'an where he found out that
Shurahbil bin Amr, the ruler of Mu ' tah was present at Balqa' with a
hundred thousand Roman troops. This news sent a wave of anxiety
into the hearts of the Muslim troops, which were halted at Ma 'an
holding consultations about dealing with the new developments. The
deliberation were going on when Abdullah bin Rawahah ~ gave a
call at the top of his voice:
"Men, you have come out in quest of martyrdom. We do not
fight the enemy on the strength of our numbers, or our power;
we fight them with the religion we have been honored with by
Allah. Thus advance towards Mu'tah and the army of
Heraclius. Keep your right and left wings in order. Come on,
we shall be winners both ways; either we win or we gain
martyrdom ."
In response to Abdullah bin Rawahah's inspiring speech, Zaid bin
Harithah ~ got up with lance in one hand and the standard in the
other. And with him rose the entire Muslim army filled with a new
spirit and enthusiasm. The Muslim troops moved ahead from Ma 'an
and chose a vast field in Mu'tah to give battle. Both the armies stood
face to face, three thousand Muslims against one hundred thousand
enemy soldiers armed to the teeth. The Muslim army had with them
Khalid bin Walid ~ for the first time and he had his first opportunity
to test his sword on behalf of Islam. Moreover, it was the first battle
between the Muslims and the Christians, Zaid bin Harithah ~ was
moving ahead of all with the standard of Islam firmly in his hand . The
right wing was Jed by Qutbah bin Qatadah Udhri ~, while the left
wing was under the charge of Abayah bin Malik Ansari~Zaid bin Harithah ~ descended on the army and died fighting
bravely with innumerable wounds on his body. The standard was

216

History of Islam

now taken in hand by Ja'far ~ who led the fight. When the battle
became confined, he jumped off his charger and hamstrung its
forelegs and fought until he lost his right hand. He took the standard
in his left hand but when it was also cut off, he kept the standard
flying with the support of his neck. At last, he fell dead on the
battlefield. The standard was then held aloft by Abdullah bin
Rawahah ~- He too dismounted from his horse and pressed
onwards. He also was granted martyrdom after killing a number of
enemy soldiers. After his exit from the battle scene the Muslims were
subdued by a sense of anxiety. But Thabit bin Aqram ~ sprang
forward and gave a call by lifting the standard: "O Muslims! Unite to
choose a man to lead you." The Muslim troops raised their voice: "We
agree on your leadership." Thereupon Thabit bin Aqram ~ said, "I
am not fit for the job; choose Khalid bin Walid as your leader." "We
agree on Khalid bin Walid," the people confirmed in one voice.
Hearing this Khalid bin Walid ~ swung into action and took the
standard from the hand of Thabit bin Aqram ~- Now the Muslim
troops rallied round him with new zeal. Khalid ~ infused in their
hearts a new spirit of do or die. And along with this he launched such
successive attacks on all sides that the enemy soldiers were left
unnerved. Not only did Khalid bin Walid ~ fight gallantly, he also
led his army to show its mettle in the battlefield. He displayed his
genius as a military commander and kept the entire military in full
control with extraordinary skill. He moved ahead and drew back the
right and the left wings according to the demand of the battle. Despite
superiority of numbers, the enemy troops did not prove a match for
the Muslim army of far less numbers and weaponry. Khalid bin Walid
~ looked like a flash of lightning throughout the battlefield. The
whole day he led his three thousand men against the large army of
one hundred thousand. By the evening the Romans escaped leaving
behind booty and corpses.

Khalid ~ - Saifullih
His instinct for leadership and military skill was acclaimed by everyone
and he has received the title of the "Sword of Allah" from Allah and
His Messenger ~ -The same day that the fighters in the cause of Islam

Prophet Muhammad ~

217

were engaged in giving battle, hundreds of miles away, the Prophet ~
ascended the pulpit to tell the Muslims: "The Muslim troops took on
the enemy. Zaid gained martyrdom and Allah forgave him then Ja 'far
took the standard in his hand and was surrounded by the enemies,
with the result that he was honored with martyrdom, and Allah
forgave him too. Following this, Abdullah bin Rawahah ~ took the
standard of Islam in his hand and fell down martyred. They were all
lifted to Paradise. After these three, Khalid bin Walid, the sword
among the swords of Allah took the standard in his hand and set the
matter right."
From that day on, Khalid bin Walid ~ came to be called Saifullah (the
Sword of Allah). As the sad news broke out, the household of Ja 'far
~ was subdued with grief. The Prophet ~ sent a meal to Ja 'far's
house. When Khalid bin Walid ~ reached near Al-Madinah along
with his troops, the Prophet~ came out of Al-Madinah to greet them
and gave Khalid ~ the glad tidings of the title of 'the Sword of
Allah'. One of the Companions saw in a dream Ja'far ~ flying in
Paradise with two wings. From that day he was called Ja'far Tayyar
- 'Ja'far, the flier' . As per one narrative, the Prophet ~ once said,
"Allah the Almighty has conferred two wings on Ja 'far with which he
keeps flying in heaven." The battle of Mu'tah was fought in Jumada
Al-Ula, 8 AH.

The Expedition to Quda 1 ah ( Dh.it-us-Sal.isil)
About a month after the battle of Mu'tah came the news that the
people of Quda'ah had collected an army near the Syrian border to
invade Al-Madinah. The Prophet ~ at once dispatched a detachment
consisting of three hundred Muhajirin and Ansar under the command
of Amr bin Al-As ~- On reaching near the enemy, it came to be
known that the number of the enemy soldiers was far more than was
expected. A courier was immediately sent to Al-Madinah. The
Prophet ~ sent Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ at the head of
reinforcements. The enemy army could not stand the joint onslaught
and scattered in fear and confusion. The raiding party returned safe
and sound. Shortly after this came the news that the Juhainah tribe,
along the seacoast, at a distance of five stages from Al-Madinah had

218

History of Islam

collected men and arms to raid Al-Madinah. The Prophet ~
immediately sent Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ at the head of three
hundred Muhajirin and Ansar, but the expedition came back without
engaging the enemy because they were so terrified at the sight of the
Muslim detachment that they fled.

Conquest of Makkah
A surprising incident occurred in Sha 'ban, 8 AH. Banu Khuza 'ah and
Banu Bakr had halted their long standing feud and made peace after
entering into alliances respectively with the Messenger of Allah~
and the Quraish as part of the Treaty of Hudaibiyah. According to the
Treaty they could not attack one another for a period of ten years. But
Banu Bakr developed an evil scheme against Banu Khuza'ah and they
planned to take revenge on their rivals. The Quraish of Makkah
should have held Banu Bakr back from implementing their plan
against Banu Khuza'ah making them uphold the Treaty. Instead of
preventing them, the Quraish, totally at variance with their obligation
to the Treaty, came out in the open lending full and active support to
Banu Bakr with men and material. They broke their covenant to the
extent that Safwan bin Umayyah, Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl, and Suhail
bin Amr joined the fighting along with Banu Bakr.
The combined attack of Banu Bakr and the Quraish inflicted on Banu
Khuza'ah a heavy loss of 20 or 30 men. Being caught by a surprise
attack at night while they were asleep, they found no where to take
refuge except at the House of Allah, the Ka'bah, and even some of
them were killed there (this was also a breach of trust as the Ka'bah
was a sanctuary for all). That fateful night when the massacre of Banu
Khuza'ah took place and the terms of the Peace Treaty were thrown to
the wind, a few persons of Banu Khuza'ah in Makkah cried for help
from the Prophet ~ - At that same moment the Messenger of Allah
was in the house of Maimunah ~ in Al-Madinah and was performing
Wudu (ablution). He heard what they said in Makkah and replied:
"Labbaik! Labbaik! (I am at your service)." Maimunah ~ said, "Whom
were you talking to when you said Labbaik?" The Prophet~ replied,
"At this moment the complaint of Banu Khuza'ah was being brought
to me and I responded to it." Amazingly, they also heard in Makkah

Prophet Muhammad Ji

219

at the same time the consoling voice of the Prophet ~ - The next
morning the Messenger of Allah ~ said to Aishah ~, "Last night,
Banu Bakr and the Quraish have jointly massacred some of the Banu
Khuza'ah." Aishah ~ said, "By this did the Quraish violate the
Treaty in your opinion?" The Prophet of Allah~ confidently said,
"They have certainly breached the trust, and very soon, Allah the
Almighty will issue His Command concerning it."
A Few days after the incident Budail bin Warga' and Amr bin Salim
came to AI-Madinah and put their complaint before the Prophet ~ Amr bin Salim told his tale of woe in a poem filled with gloom and
grief at their being brutally attacked and killed. Some of the verses are
as follows:
"The Quraish have committed a breach of trust against you,
and they have broken the firm treaty signed with you.
They have plundered us like hay, and they believe that we have
nobody to help us.
They are mean and deficient in number, and they attacked us at
Watir when we were lying asleep."
The Prophet of Allah :i; consoled them saying, "You will be helped." At
the time of their departure from Al-Madinah the Messenger of Allah :i;
remarked: "Abu Sufyan has set out from Makkah to seek an extension in
the duration of Peace Treaty and get it consolidated, but his mission will
end in failure."
When the Makkans found time to think over the consequences of their
misconduct, they were struck by fear. They sent Abu Sufyan to renew
the Peace Treaty. The Messenger of Allah ~ ordered the Muslims, on
the other hand, to make preparations for the ensuing battle and to
keep it a top secret. On the way back to Makkah, Budail bin Warga'
and his group came across Abu Sufyan who was heading for AlMadinah. "Where have you been?" asked Abu Sufyan. "I was only up
in this valley," Budail replied. Abu Sufyan was under the impression
that the Prophet :i; was unaware of the attack against Banu Khuza 'ah
that had just occurred. He was determined to get the Peace Treaty
renewed as soon as possible.

220

History of Islam

Abu Sufyan in AI-Madinah:
Abu Sufyan came to Al-Madinah and made several attempts to
contact the Prophet of Allah ~ ' Abu Bakr Siddiq, Umar and Ali :.~,
but none of them paid attention to him. During this exercise in futility
Ali ~, in order to make him look foolish, said to him, "You are the
chief of Banu Kinanah, so you can go to the Prophet's Mosque and
announce that you extend the terms of the Treaty and confirm it." He
did accordingly and left in hurry. When he went back to Makkah and
related what had happened, they laughed at him saying, "Ali has
made a fool of you." Only then did Abu Sufyan become conscious of
his stupidity. Immediately after the departure of Abu Sufyan, the
Prophet ~ asked the Companions to march on Makkah. In spite of the
massive size of the military preparations, the Companions did not
know the target of attack. It was simply because the Messenger of
Allah ~ wanted the Makkans to be caught unaware.
However, a Companion of the Prophet ~ ' Hatib bin Abu Balta'ah ~
informed the Quraish of the impending Muslim attack, in a letter sent
through a woman. Allah the Almighty informed this to His
Messenger ~ through inspiration. He sent Ali and Zubair bin
Awwam ~ immediately after the woman with the description of her
features. They caught her after a hard chase, he searched her
belongings but the letter remained hidden. However, Ali~ was quite
sure about the letter because he knew the Prophet ::i did not say
anything that wasn' t absolutely true. When Ali ~ threatened her
with dire consequences, she drew out the letter from her hair and
handed it over to them. The letter was from Hatib bin Abu Balta'ah
4'k, to the Quraish. The letter along with the woman was brought to
the Messenger of Allah ~- Hatib 4:b was sent for and was asked for an
explanation. He said, "Since my relatives were still in Makkah and in
danger, I liked to oblige the Makkans by informing them about the
ensuing Muslim attack so that my relatives would remain safe from
them." Having heard this, Umar 4:b lost his temper and said, "O
Messenger of Allah! Allow me to cut his head off." The Prophet ~
observed, "O Umar, Hatib has committed a mistake which is
pardonable." And so Hatib ~ was forgiven.

Prophet Muhammad :Ji

221

March to Makkah:
On Ramadan 11, 8 AH, the Prophet~ set out from Al-Madinah at the
head of a ten-thousand-man army of the Companions. The failure of
Abu Sufyan' s mission had disheartened the Quraish and they were in
the dark about the plans of the believers. The Prophet's march to
Makkah was very swift. They came across his uncle Abbas bin AbdulMuttalib ~ on the way who, along with his wife and children, was
moving to Al-Madinah after they had embraced Islam. The Messenger
of Allah ~ took Abbas ~ to Makkah and sent his relatives to AlMadinah. Marching quickly, the Muslim army reached Marr-azZahran at a distance of 8 miles from Makkah. The Makkans were still
unaware of the presence of Muslim troops even though they were so
close to Makkah. They encamped at that place. The Makkans came to
know of the Muslim force only from the shepherds who went back in
the night. Informed of this, Abu Sufyan came out to look into the
matter. The Prophet~ had already deputed Umar ~ at the head of a
patrol party to ward off a night attack.
Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib ~ was anxious about the safety of his people
and wanted them to accept Islam and be safe. He came out mounted
on Duldul, the mule of the Prophet ~, in the night and moved
towards Makkah. As per the order of the Messenger of Allah ~ the
entire Muslim army had, in separate groups of one thousand each, lit
their campfires.
When Abu Sufyan witnessed the blazing campfires spread over a vast
area, he was shocked and stunned to the core to think how such a
large army had been collected.
Abbas ~ recognized the voice of Abu Sufyan even in the dark night
and sounded back that the army belonged to the Prophet ~ and was
ready to invade Makkah the next morning. Abu Sufyan was left more
confounded at this disheartening news. He, in a state of utmost
bewilderment, drew near Abbas ~ to seek his counsel at this
juncture. Abbas ~ said to him, "Ride on the back of this mule and I
will bring you to the Prophet~ for he alone can give you protection."
Abu Sufyan got on the mule without a moment's delay. Umar Faruq

222

History of Islam

recognized Abu Sufyan and wanted to kill him at once. But Abbas ~
spurred the mule and quickly went into the camp of the Prophet ::i,
Umar • came chasing him and said, "O Prophet of Allah! Command
me to kill this disbeliever, for he has come under our control without
any condition." Abbas~ said, "I have already given him protection."
But Umar • sought permission once again. Abbas~ replied to him
with a pinch of taunt, "Umar'! You would not have insisted on his
being killed had he belonged to your family." Thereupon Umar ~
said, "Abbas! I felt more happy on your accepting Islam than I would
have been, had my father done so because I found the Prophet~
eager for your becoming a Muslim." After this exchange between the
two, the Prophet of Allah ~ enjoined, "Well, Abu Sufyan is given
respite for a night." Following this he asked Abbas ~ to keep Abu
Sufyan in his own camp. And next morning Abu Sufyan appeared
before the Prophet~ and confessed Islam.

Abu Sufyan ~ honored
Abbas • appeared before the Prophet of Allah ~ and submitted,
"Abu Sufyan is a person who loves honor, so would you please give
him some special honor." At this h~ said, "He who enters the Sacred
Mosque will be safe, he who enters the house of Abu Sufyan will be
safe, he who shuts his doors upon himself will be safe and he who
goes unarmed will be safe." Abu Sufyan ~ felt elated.
The army on the move surged like an ocean . Different tribes had
passed by with their tribal colors. Abu Sufyan ~ ascended a raised
spot to witness the spectacle of the Muslim troops on the march and
hurried back to Makkah ahead of all to announce: "He who enters the
Sacred Mosque or my house will be safe." The Prophet of Allah ~
wanted to avoid bloodshed at all costs. His exit from Makkah in a
state of helplessness and then his victorious and glorious return must
have been on his mind. This day he made a triumphant entry into
Makkah with his head lowered giving thanks to Allah the Almighty.
He then circumambulated the Ka'bah seven times mounted on his
animal and then cleared the Ka'bah of idols. He then took the keys of
the Ka'bah from Uthman bin Talhah, and entered the Ka'bah and
prayed to Allah the Exalted. Following this the Prophet of Allah ~

Prophet Muhammad 1!

223

stood at the door of the Ka'bah, holding its frame, while the Quraish
arranged themselves in front of him in the courtyard filled with fear
and shame.

Historic Address of the Prophet ~=
The Prophet ~ said addressing them: "There is no God but Allah
Alone. He has made good His Promise and help to His slave. He has
alone overthrown all the Confederates. Lo'! All the rites, privileges and
claims to retaliation and blood compensation are beneath my feet
except the custody of the Ka'bah and the giving water to the pilgrims.
Even cutting down a green tree is not valid within the sanctuary. 0 you
people of the Quraish, Allah has abolished the haughtiness of
paganism and the pride of lineage. Man comes from Adam and Adam
came from dust. Allah the Almighty says: 'O mankind! We have
created you from a male and a female, and have made you nations and
tribes that you may know one another. Verily! the noblest of you, with
Allah is the best in conduct.' (49:13) 0 Quraish, what do you think I am
about to do with you?" "We hope for the best," they replied, "you are a
noble brother, son of a noble brother." The Prophet of Allah ~ said in
reply, "I say to you what Yusuf (Prophet Joseph) said to his brothers:
'Have no fear this day, go your way for you are all free'."
The address being over, the Prophet~ went up to Mount Safa and sat
down to take the oath of allegiance to Allah and His Messenger from
, the people. After finishing with men, he deputed Umar ~ to take
Bai'ah from the women, and he kept seeking forgiveness of Allah for
them. Safwan bin Umayyah fled to Yemen for fear of life. Umair bin
Wahb from his tribe sought safety for him and he was granted
immunity. Safwan was the man who had resisted the entry of the
Muslims into Makkah and fled from Makkah after the conquest; so
did Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl, and he too was granted safety. Both of them
had the pleasure of coming to the fold of Islam after the battle of
IHunain.

The Truth came and Falsehood vanquished:
Destruction of idols installed in the Ka'bah meant the destruction of
the idols all over Arabia. Likewise, the entry of the Quraish into Islam

224

History of Islam

implied the whole Arabia coming to the fold of Islam, for all eyes
were fixed on the Quraish of Makkah to see whether they accepted
Islam or not.
A large number of the Quraish were converted to Islam after the
conquest of Makkah. However, many of them still remained
immovable and unyielding. But none of them were compelled to
accept Islam. The sole aim before the Muslims was to do away with
disruptions, bring perfect peace and confer on them complete
religious freedom. With peace prevailing and freedom of religious
practice granted, the idol worshipers got a full opportunity to study,
observe and watch Islam in operation. It resulted in their quick
conversion to Islam in large numbers.
After the conquest of Makkah, the Prophet~ announced throughout
the land that nobody becoming a Muslim was allowed to keep an idol
in his house. Following this he sent a few parties to destroy idols
installed in the area around Makkah. He sent Khalid bin Walid ~ at
the head of thirty soldiers to break Uzza, the idol of Banu Kinanah
and to pull down its temple. Khalid bin Walid ~ went and broke
Uzza to pieces and razed its temple to the ground. Amr bin Al-As~,
was sent to destroy Suwa', the idol of Banu Hudhail. When Amr bin
Al-As ~ reached the spot, the priest said, "How will you be able to
overpower it?" Amr ~ said, "Just watch." Saying this he entered the
temple and broke the idol to pieces. Seeing this, the priest renounced
idolatry and embraced Islam on the spot. Sa'd bin Zaid Ashhali ~
was sent to Qadid to destroy Manat. The priests were sure the
Muslims would fail in their task but they saw with their own eyes the
believers break the idols and pull the temple down. All idols and
temples were destroyed .
The first priority being completed, the Prophet ~ resumed his mission
of preaching Islam through Muslim missionaries and sent them near
and far. Khalid bin Walid ~ was sent to Banu Jadhimah with the
order to avoid a fight. But the situation demanded it and a few from
Banu Jadhimah were killed. When Khalid bin Walid ~ returned to
Makkah with the booty, the Prophet ~ expressed regret and sent back
the booty along with blood money through Ali ~-

Battle of Hunain
The resounding victory of the Muslims over the Quraish and the everincreasing conversions to Islam frightened the enemies of Islam out of
their senses. Those tribes who were not allies of the Muslims were
disturbed and worried. The Hawazin and the Thaqif were the two
tribes who were most hostile to Islam and they also were old archrivals of the Quraish. Living between Ta'if and Makkah, they
expected to become the nex t target of attack by the Muslims. The
Hawazin Chief, Malik bin Auf brought around him all the tribes of
Banu Hawazin and Banu Thaqif to fight against the Muslims. Several
other tribes like Nasr, Jusham and Sa'd also joined hands with the
Hawazin. Their troops concentrated at Autas. On receiving this
information, the Prophet~ sent Abdullah bin Abu Hadrad Aslami ~
as a spy. He came back with the news that the enemy had already
completed its military preparations and they were ready to fight.
The Prophet ~ ordered quick preparations and led an army of twelve
thousands comprising ten thousand men from the Muhajirin and the
Ansar and two thou sand new entrants to Islam from Makkah. The
Muslim army reached Hunain on Shawwal 10, 8 AH. The enemy had
already taken its position in the depressions and hollows and the
craters of the valley. As the Muslim army started descending into the
valley in the half light of morning, the enemy suddenly rose from
their place of ambush and started to attack with full force.
Since the Muslims were caught unaware by the celebrated archers of
Hawazin, they could not withstand the sudden onslaught of the
enemy and their flanks fell back. The two thousand Makkans were the
first to flee in terror no one paying attention to the other. The Prophet
~ was then on the right side of the valley along with Abu Bakr, Umar
Faruq, Ali, Abbas, Fadl bin Abbas, and Abu Sufyan bin Al-Harith ~.
The Prophet ~ had all the while stood firm in his place, riding his
white mule without any fear or nervousness. Abbas bin Abdul-Muttalib
~ was holding the bridle of his mule, while the Prophet of Allah ~
was calling aloud: "Verily, I am the Prophet without falsehood; I am
son of Abdul-Muttalib."

226

History of Islam

When the Prophet :i saw his men in confusion, he said, "O Abbas,
call the Muslims to this side." The Muslims recognized his voice and
rushed towards the Prophet ~- However, not more than about a
hundred men could rally around the Prophet ~ for the rest were
barred by the intervening enemy and resumed fighting from where
they had been.
Calling out Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Most Great), the Prophet~
advanced with his mule and launched such a fierce attack that the
enemy plunged into disorder and confusion and fled from the scene.
Now the Muslim troops gathered and bore down upon the army,
which resulted in a smashing defeat of the enemies of Islam. At the
outset, when the Muslims were suffering reverses, a rud e fellow from
Makkah who had joined the Muslim army but was still not strong in
faith, let out his antipathy to Islam saying, "The spell of their sorcery
has ended today." Another person of the same category remarked.
"Their flight will not stop before they get to the sea." A man named
Shaibah stepped forward towards the Prophet ~ with the evil
intention of taking revenge on him but fell down unconscious.
The Hawazin paid a heavy toll in the battle before escaping in terror.
Banu Thaqif then attempted to fill the gap but in vain. They could not
resist the advancing flood of Muslim troops and fled from the battle
field after suffering terrible loss of life. Notable chieftains of the
enemy were killed but their commander-in-chief, Malik bin Auf
escaped unhurt and took refuge in Ta'if. A part of the fugitives
gathered in Autas while another fled to Nakhlah for their lives. The
Prophet :i sent military detachments chasing them and fighting took
place at both locations again, they could not withstand the heavy
onslaught of the Muslims and gave in.
The Muslims returned victorious with booty and captives. When the
captives and spoils of Hunain were brought to the Prophet~, he
ordered them to be taken to Ji 'ranah and appointed Mas'ud bin Amr
Ghifari ~ to be in charge. The spoils of this battle, known as the
Battle of Hunain, went up to six thousand captives, twenty-four
thousand camels, more than forty thousand sheep and goats, and four
thousand Uqiyyah (a measure of weight) of silver.

Prophet Muhammad ;Ji

Siege of Ta'if
The fortress of Malik bin Auf was located in route from the valley of
Hunain to Ta'if and the Prophet ~ demolished it along with the
fortress of A tam. He found the people of Ta'if wanting to give battle
and so they were besieged. The siege dragged on for twenty days.
During this period people from the surrounding areas began
accepting Islam. During the battle of Hunain only four Muslims were
martyred while during the siege of Ta'if the number of Muslim
martyrs reached twelve. The Prophet~, at last, raised the siege and
returned to Ji'ranah with his men and distributed the spoils.
A deputation of the Hawazin came there and called on the Prophet of
Allah ~ and sought forgiveness for the sake of Halimah Sa'diyah. He
asked them to come at the time of Zuhr prayer when all the Muslims
would congregate for the prayer. When they did as told, the Prophet
~ gave his reply, "Whatever was apportioned to me and the Banu
Abdul-Muttalib is yours." Thereupon the Muhajirin and the Ansiir
said, "Whatever share has been given to us is passed on to the
Prophet ~-" Saying this, they set all the captives of Hawazin free.
Thus, in a very short duration, about six thousand prisoners were
released. Among the captives was also Shima' bint Halimah Sa'diyah,
the foster-sister of the Prophet~- When she was produced before the
Prophet ~' she said, "O Prophet of Allah, I am your foster-sister." The
Prophet ~ asked for proof, and she replied, "The bite you gave me on
my leg. The mark is still there." The Prophet ~ accepted the proof and
stretched out his robe for her to sit on and treated her courteously. He
gave her the choice of living with him in affection and honor or going
back to her people. She chose to go back to her tribe. And the Prophet
~ gave her a bondsman, a slave girl and a considerable quantity of
wealth and goods.

Deep Love of the Ansarfor the Messenger~
When the Prophet ~ began to distribute the spoils at Ji'ranah, he gave
a large portion to the Quraish whose faith in Islam, he wanted to
strengthen. Since most of the Makkans were from the Quraish, and

228

History of Islam

they were relatives and fellow-countrymen of the Prophet ~, some of
the young men among the Anstir aired their grievances at the meager
gifts given to them and the large portion given to the Prophet's
relatives and compatriots.
The Prophet ~ also got wind of what was going on among the
younger section of the Anstir. The Prophet of Allah ~ ordered the
Anstir to assemble in an enclosure. He then said addressing them,
"Did you say such and such?" The Anstir submitted in reply: "Our
young men have said so no doubt, but none of the discerning,
respectable and mature persons has ever thought it nor has such a
thought ever entered our minds."
Having heard this, the Prophet of Allah~ said: "O the Anstir, did J
not come to you when you were astray, and Allah guided you
through me?" The Anstir replied, "Yes, indeed, Allah and His Prophet
are most kind and generous." The Prophet ~ again asked them, "You
were divided and He softened your hearts and you united through
me?" They again submitted, "Yes, indeed, you did us this great
favor." The Prophet ~ asked once again, "You were poor and Allah
made you rich through me?" The Anstir admitted, "Yes, indeed, Allah
and His Messenger did this great favor for us." The Prophet~ again
asked them, "O Anstir, why don' t you speak to me?" He then added,
"I would have acknowledged it if you had replied: 'You came
discredited and we believed you; you came deserted and we helped
you; you were a fugitive and we gave you shelter; you were poor and
we comforted you.' 0 Anstir, are you not satisfied that these men
should take away camels and goats while you go back with the
Prophet .of Allah?"
The Anstir wept bitterly until tears ran down their beards. The
Prophet of Allah~ further said, "Had migration not been destined, I
would have been one of the Anstir myself. If all the people go one
way, and the Anstir take another, I would take the way of the Ansnr. 0
Allah! Have mercy on the Anstir and their children and their
children." We can not even conceive of the joys, the Anstir felt at this
time. The Prophet of Allah ~ let them understand that these people
were new entrants to Islam and they were given more so they would
be reconciled to Islam, not by way of any special favor.

Prophet Muhammad !Ii

First Governor of Makkah
On the way back from Ji'ranah, the Prophet of Allah :i entered
Makkah to perform Umrah. Before leaving, he installed as Governor of
Makkah, a young man of a little more than twenty years. Also he left
Mu'adh bin Jabal ~ as an instructor of the Qur'an and Islamic
injunctions. The young governor named Attab bin Usaid was given
the significant post for his profound fondness of religious knowledge.
A dirham per day was fixed for him so that he would not depend on
anyone else for his needs. He was the first man in Islam to perform Hajj
as a ruler.
That year the Muslims and non-Muslims performed Hajj according to
their own tenets and none got in the way of other. However, they
performed their duties so close to one another that the polytheists found
ample opportunity to observe the good deeds and moral excellence of the
Muslims.
It is worth mentioning here that Urwah bin Mas'ud, a chieftain of
Ta'if was outside when Ta'if was raided by Muslim troops in 8 AH.
Urwah now followed the Prophet :i when he was on his way to AlMadinah and confessed Islam at his hand before his entry into AlMadinah. Urwah ~ then sought permission of the Prophet :i to
preach Islam among his people. He :i said, "Your people take pride in
that they could not be defeated by the Muslim army. When you
preach Islam to them, you might be killed." Urwah ~ submitted,
"My people love me very much and I hope they will listen to me."
Thus the Prophet :i acceded to his request. Following this, he went to
Ta'if, ascended a raised place and began to call the people to accept
Islam. The people of Ta'if surrounded him on all sides and showered
arrows on him, which led to his martyrdom. On being asked about
the retaliation, Urwah ~ said to his relatives: "By the Grace of Allah,
I have been honored with martyrdom. Now my sole desire is that I
am buried beside those Companions of the Prophet :i who were
martyred and buried during the Muslim siege of Ta'if." It was in this
year that the Prophet's son Ibrahim was born to Maria Qibtiyah
(Coptic). Also in this year his daughter Zainab ~ passed away. The
same year, a wooden pulpit was made for the Prophet :i, and he

230

History of Islam

wrote a letter to Mundhir bin Sawa. Mundhir bin Sawa ~ had
already embraced Islam in response to an earlier letter sent to him,
according to which he began to charge the Jizyah (protection tax) from
the Jews and Magians of his territory.

The Ninth Year of Migration
Following the Prophet's return to AI-Madinah after the conquest of
Makkah and Hunain, the pagans of Arabia started coming into the
fold of Islam. At the outset of 9 AH, people from the far off regions of
Arabia began to send their representatives to the Prophet of Allah ~
to announce their declaration of Islam. That is why, 9 AH came to be
called the Year of Deputations. From the temporal standpoint too, the
Prophet ~ had become the ruler of Arabia. The believers had Zak!,t
made obligatory on them, while the disbelievers had to pay a nominal
amount as Jizyah (protection tax). In order to collect the Zakat, tax
collectors were sent to various tribes. At times the tax collectors
suffered resistance and even were martyred, while on other occasions
they punished the wrong doers. At last, a regular system of Zakiit was
established.

Expedition to Tabuk
The Ghassanide King collected a big army to avenge his ignominious
defeat at Mu'tah. He then sought help from Heraclius of Rome, who
was pleased to send an army forty thousand strong to his help and
decided to march with the large army. The monk named Abu Amir,
referred to before, went to the Byzantine monarch, Caesar with the
sole purpose of inducing him to invade AI-Madinah. Abu Amir was
also regularly but secretly in correspondence with the hypocrites of
Al-Madinah, who had already started construction work of a mosque
named Dirar Mosque. News of such serious matters kept pouring into
Al-Madinah for some time. Military movements of this magnitude
could not be ignored. The Prophet of Allah ~ gave a call to the
believers in general to come and join hands to take on the massive
army of Heraclius. The Muslims from all areas of the country rushed
to Al-Madinah in response to the call.

Prophet Muhammad :jj

231

The Prophet of Allah~ generally kept the military preparations and
movements a secret to keep the hypocrites and the enemy in the dark.
But, since such large-scale preparations were not possible secretly and
silently, the Prophet~ announced that the preparations were to give
battle to the Roman army. It was the year of a bumper crop and the
time of reaping the harvest was upon them and some of the people
felt a little unwilling to leave and lose the crop.
Heraclius and his ministers had brought the hypocrites to their side as
a part of their military campaign. The hypocrites were constantly in
league with the Jews of Al-Madinah and were holding regular
consultations against the Muslims. A band of twelve hypocrites built
their own separate mosque as a center for carrying out their hostile
activities and anti-Islamic propaganda, and for creating a rift among
the Muslims. When they saw the Muslims engaged in preparing for
the impending battle, they started passing discouraging remarks
along with mentioning the hardships of such a long and arduous
journey. What they wanted was the Caesar to invade Al-Madinah and
to frustrate all the efforts of the Muslims to stop this Christian
movement towards Al-Madinah.
The Prophet ~ had, on the other hand, ordered all the Companions to
join the expedition. Since coming face to face with the massive
Christian army meant large-scale preparations from the Muslim camp
which needed provisions, mounts, and weapons in large quantities
and numbers. The Prophet ~ had, therefore, made an appeal to the
Muslim masses to lavishly contribute to the war fund.
The Muslims had also showed an astonishing response to the appeal.
Othman bin Affan ~ was about to dispatch his trade caravan to
Syria, but contributed the whole of it to the Muslim campaign. Abu
Bakr Siddiq ~ contributed all goods and chattels of his household,
entrusting his wife and children to Allah the Almighty, while Umar
Farug ~ divided everything in his house in two and gave one half to
the fund being raised by the Prophet of Allah ~The poor among the Muslims who lived on their sweat and labor
contributed their wages to the Muslim war preparations. The
hypocrites didn't give any contributions. An army of thirty thousand

232

History of Islam

strong collected in Al-Madinah. The Muslim army could hardly
prepared footwear because the Prophet~ said to them that footwear
raises foot soldiers to the category of cavalry.

Islamic Army's Departure:
The Messenger of Allah ~ set out for Tabuk with an army of 30,000
men from Al-Madinah. The campaign was undertaken in the month
of Rajab, 9 AH. They had hardly covered a distance of one hour and
reached Dhi Awan when the hypocrites submitted, "We have built a
mosque. Please offer prayer therein to bless it." The Prophet ~
replied, "Presently, I am busy making preparations for the journey; I
shall see to it on my return." Departing from Al-Madinah, he ordered
the army to pitch the camp at Thaniya-tul-Wada and he put
Muhammad bin Maslamah Ansari~ in charge of Al-Madinah.
The chief of the hypocrites, Abdullah bin Ubai also left Al-Madinah
with his band of people and camped at the low-lying area of the
Thaniya-tul-Wada. He apparently wanted to show that he also
accompanied the Muslim troops, but in fact, he broke away from the
Muslims and came back to Al-Madinah with his men. However, a few
of them went along to work as spies for the forces hostile to Islam.
The Prophet ~ had left behind Ali~ to look after his family.
The hypocrites used this as an opportunity to spread false rumors
about Ali ,tk,. They implied that the Prophet~ gave little importance
to Ali ,tk, and, therefore, left him alone in Al-Madinah. When his
patience ran out, he hurried from Al-Madinah and joining the Prophet
~ at Al-Jurf asked, "The hypocrites are saying such and such about
me and so I have come to you." The Prophet of Allah ~ said, "They
are liars. I have left you behind to look after my household; so go
back." In order to sooth his feelings the Prophet~ further said, "You
are to me as Hamn was to Musa, except that there will be no Prophet
after me." Ali ,tk, returned to Al-Madinah pacified and satisfied.
When the Muslim army arrived at Al-Hijr (presently Al-Qura Valley),
the destroyed territory of Thamud, the Prophet ~ exhorted, "Pass on
swiftly seeking forgiveness of Allah even without drinking a drop of
water from its wells." When the Muslim troops had to pass a night at

Prophet Muhammad ~

233

Al-Hijr the Prophet~ told them that no one was to go alone out of the
camp. When passing through the ruins of the deserted territory, he
covered his face with his mantle and drove his mount fast. He also
instructed his Companions to hurry up seeking the forgiveness of
Allah the Almighty while passing through the settlements of the
tyrants and sinners lest they be overtaken by what they (the Thamud)
had suffered.

At Tabuk:
When the Muslim expedition arrived at the stream of Tabuk near the
Syrian border, Heraclius recognized him as a true Prophet and
withdrew out of fear. The Christian troops and the Ghassanide king
also left their positions and cleared out of the area of the Muslim
force. Tabuk lay at a distance of fourteen or fifteen stages from AlMadinah where the Prophet ~ stayed for about twenty days. During
this period, Yuhannah bin Ru'bah, the ruler of Ailah appeared before
the Prophet ~ to offer his obedience to him, his request was accepted
in return for Jizyah (tax) which he paid on the spot. The people of
Jarba' also followed suit and earned peace on the same conditions,
and the same came to pass with the people of Adhruh.
Dumat-ul-Jandal was located near Tabuk whose ruler Ukaidir bin
Abdul-Malik was a Christian and belonged to Banu Kindah tribe. He
refused to obey the Prophet ~ and showed arrogance. He sent Khalid
bin Walid ~ at the head of a detachment saying, "You will see Ukaidir
hunting a white antelope." When Khalid ~ came near to his palace
after a night's journey, he saw an amazing event.

It was a hot summer moonlit night, Ukaidir was enjoying his rest with
his wife on top of his palace. All of a sudden a white antelope came out
from the adjacent forest and started rubbing its horns against the gate
of his palace. His wife drew her husband's attention to this. Ukaidir,
along with his brother Hassan, chased the animal on horseback. He had
covered a short distance when Khalid's detachment surrounded them.
Ukaidir was captured alive while his brother was killed in the
encounter. His beautiful silken garment was sent ahead through a
courier and Ukaidir himself was brought by Khalid bin Walid ~- The
Prophet ~ spared the life of Ukaidir who showed his obedience and

234

History of Islam

promised to pay the Jizyah. After returning to his palace, he sent to the
Prophet ~ two thousand camels, eight hundred horses, four hundred
pieces of armor and four hundred lances and was granted a peace
treaty.

Dirar Mosque burnt down
When the rulers of the Syrian frontier were totally subdued, the
Prophet ~ and his Companions decided to go back to Al-Madinah. At
a distance of one hour from Al-Madinah, the Prophet :j sent Malik
bin Dukhshum Salimi and Ma'n bin Adi Ajli ~ to bum down and
demolish the mosque built by the hypocrites, the Prophet of Allah ~
was instructed to do so from the Verse: "And as for those who put up
a mosque by way of harm ... " (9:107)
The Prophet ~ and his Companions came back to Al-Madinah in
Ramadan, 9 AH. [According to the occurrence of events, his return to
Al-Madinah seems in the month of Ra jab.]
Ka'b bin Malik, Mura.rah bin Rabi' and Hila.I bin Umayyah :$, were
the three Companions who did not join the Muslim expedition to
Tabuk on account of their indecision. On the return of the Prophet of
Allah ~ all three appeared before him and confessed their faults. The
Prophet ~ forbade everyone to speak to them. For fifty days they kept
seeking the forgiveness of Allah, then Allah granted them a pardon.
Before they were pardoned, no one including their family members
would even respond to their salutations.
They felt forsaken and abandoned and the whole world seemed to
have closed on them. When the King of Ghassan came to know of this
ordeal, he sent a courier to Ka'b bin Malik ~ with a letter in which he
had written: "You are a man of wealth and honor and Muhammad
has ill-treated you to the extreme. You better come to me. I shall hold
you in the highest honor and grant you very good treatment." Having
gone through this letter, Ka'b ~ threw it into an oven.
When the repentance of Ka'b bin Malik ~ was accepted, the Prophet
the Companions congratulated him and he gave away all his
wealth and property in the way of Allah .

The People of Ta'if accept Islam
When the people of Ta'if heard the news of the Muslim's successes in
Tabuk they were totally sure that they were no match for the Muslim
force. Urwah bin Mas'ud ~ had been martyred in Ta'if, but his son
Abul-Mulaih along with a few others came to Al-Madinah and
embraced Islam. On the Prophet's return from Tabuk, Abd Yalil bin
Amr came to Al-Madinah at the head of a deputation of the people of
Ta'if. He allowed them to camp in a corner of the Prophet's Mosque.
Abd Yalil and his fellows accepted Islam and took an oath of
allegiance at the hand of the Prophet~ on behalf of their people. The
Prophet ~ sent Uthman bin Abu Al-As~ there as their ruler, and
Mughirah bin Shu'bah ~ to demolish their temple of idol Lat. From
the treasures of the temple, the blood money of Urwah bin Mas'ud ~
was paid and the rest was distributed among the Muslims.
The deputations started arriving after the Prophet's return to AlMadinah. They would come to accept Islam and then return to their
people along with some Companions to teach them Islam. He would
give gifts and rewards at the time of their departure. Meanwhile Ali
~ was sent to the Tai' tribe at the head of a detachment, which
stormed the region and Adi bin Hatim, the ruler of the Tai' ran away.
However, Hatim's daughter was brought as a captive.
She requested the Prophet ~ to favor her. He set her free but asked
her to stay until a noble man was available to take her to her region.
In a few days the people of Syria came to the Prophet ~ and he sent
her with them along with some clothes and provisions.
When the girl reached her brother Adi bin Hatim, he asked his sister:
"What kind of man is the Prophet?" She replied, "He is a man to meet
with; he is very noble and polite and a great benefactor." Adi got right
up and left for Al-Madinah as a representative of his people. The
Prophet ~ gave him respect, took him to his home from the Prophet's
Mosque and seated him on his bed. On the way home a woman
stopped him (the Prophet~) and he stayed with her until she finished
talking. Such a kind and noble gesture affected Adi. Following this
the Prophet ~ gave him some good counsel. At the end, Adi bin

236

History of Islam

Hatim stretched out his hand, took the oath of allegiance, became a
Muslim and returned to his people.

First Deputy of the Prophet of Allah
After returning from Tabuk the arrival of deputations kept the
Prophet :j so busy that he could not spare himself to lead the Hajj
caravan to Makkah. He delegated Abu Bakr ~ to perform the job.
Abu Bakr ~ departed at the head of three hundred Hajj pilgrims
along with twenty camels from the Prophet :j and five of his own to
be sacrificed during Hajj. Soon after the departure of the Hajj caravan
under Abu Bakr ~, forty Verses of Surat At-Taubah were revealed.
These Verses delineated some essential injunctions like banning the
polytheists' entry into the zone of the Sacred Mosque from the next
year, banning the naked circumambulation of the House of Allah, and
the fulfilling of the covenant made with the Prophet ~- These
injunctions were supposed to be announced on the occasion of the

Hajj.
The Prophet :j immediately sent Ali~ riding on his (the Prophet's)
dromedary with the instructions that these Verses be read out to the
audience on the Day of Sacrifice after the Hajj was completed. Ali ~
traveled quickly and caught up with the caravan of Abu Bakr~ at
Dhul-Hulaifah. Abu Bakr ~ asked him whether he had come as the
commander or the commanded. "I have come as the commanded and
you will remain the commander. I have been entrusted with the duty
of reading out these Verses." On reaching Makkah, Abu Bakr ~
oversaw the Muslims perform the rites of Hajj while Ali~ read out
the Verses of Surat At-Taubah.
The same year the Prophet's daughter Umm Kulthum ~ passed
away, Hajj was declared as obligatory and was performed under the
guidance of a Muslim leader and Abu Bakr~ gave them instructions
on the rites of Hajj. The polytheists were given a duration of only four
months to vacate the sacred zone otherwise Allah and His Messenger
:j would bear no responsibility whatsoever concerning them. Hearing
this announcement even those in Makkah who had remained
polytheists accepted Islam. Abdullah bin Ubai died the same year.

The Tenth Year of Migration
From Muharram 10 AH up to the end of the year, deputations kept
arriving and Arab tribes continued joining the caravan of Islam. In
Rabi' Al-A.khir, Khalid bin Walid ~ was sent to Najran and its
surrounding areas accompanied by four hundred Companions with
instructions to call the people thrice to accept Islam and avoid
fighting. They were pleased to embrace Islam when Khalid bin Walid
~ reached there. Banu Al-Harith bin Ka'b was one of the tribes who
was converted to Islam. The Prophet ~ called Khalid ~ and the
Companions back while Amr bin Hazm ~ was sent to those areas as
an instructor of Islam.
In Ramadan 10 AH, a deputation from Ghassan tribe came, which
consisted of three members. They accepted Islam with all pleasure and
returned to their people, but they refused to come into the fold of Islam.
In Shawwal 10 AH, a seven-member deputation from Banu Sala.man
came headed by its chief Habib bin Amr, and returned after accepting
Islam. One day Habib bin Amr ~ asked the Prophet ~' "Which is the
most excellent deed in Islam?" He replied, "It is to offer prayer on time."
During the same period came the deputation of ten members from
Azd and accepted Islam, by their preaching the whole tribe converted
to Islam. For the same reason a fight broke out between Azd and
Jursh tribes. Before the fight, Jursh people had sent their two men to
Al-Madinah to enquire about the Prophet ~- When these men
approached the Prophet ~, he said to them, "The Jursh and the Azd
engaged themselves in fighting against one another and the Jursh
were defeated." It had happened the same day. When both went back
and related the event, the entire Jursh tribe accepted Islam. The same
year, Ali ~ was sent to Yemen to teach them Tauhid and forbid
polytheism. With his efforts, Hamdan, the well known tribe of Yemen,
embraced Islam entirely. During this year the deputation from Murad
tribe came after breaking away from Muluk Kindah and accepted
Islam. The deputation of Banu Abdul-Qais also came headed by Jarud
bin Amr and they all converted to Islam from Christianity. They went
back and brought their whole tribe to Islam.

238

History of Islam

Musailamah Kadhdhab
In the same year the deputation of Banu Hanifah came from
Yamamah which included Musailamah bin Hubaib Kadhdhab (liar),
Jurjan bin Ghanam, Talq bin Ali and Salman bin Hanzalah. They
stayed for a fortnight and learned the Qur'an from Ubai bin Ka'b
During this period, other persons used to be in the company of the
Prophet :i, but Musailamah was away most of the time, with the
permission of the Prophet :i, under the pretext of looking after the
belongings of the group. Among the deputations which came during
this year were those of Banu Kindah, Banu Kinanah and Hadramout
and accepted Islam. In the same year, Wa'il bin Hujr appeared before
the Prophet ~ and embraced Islam. Expressing his joy over this, the
Prophet ~ asked Mu'awiyah bin Abu Sufyan ~ to make him his
guest. On the way to his home Mu'awiyah ~ was on foot and Wa'il
bin Hujr was on his mount. Mu'awiyah ~ asked Wa'il for his
footwear because his feet were burning from the heat. "I shall not give
them for I have already worn them," Wa'il replied rather rudely.
"Well, let me ride behind you," Mu'awiyah ~ proposed as an
alternative. "You can't ride the mount of a king," Wa'il replied with
an air of arrogance. "But my feet are burning," Mu'awiyah ~ spoke
rather painfully. "It is enough for you to walk in the shadow of my
camel," Wa'il retorted. This is the same Wa'il that when he
approached Mu'awiyah ~ during his caliphate, he showed him so
much respect.

Hubihalah
This means mutual condemnation and the asking of God's
punishment to come down on the one who is false. The same year a
Christian deputation came from Najran along with their chief AbdulMasih and bishop Abu Harithah, they were 60 people with 24 from
the distinguished families. They entered the Prophet's Mosque and
started bitter arguments. Meanwhile, the earlier Verses of Surat Allmran and the Verse regarding Mubahalah were sent down. When the
Prophet :i asked them to accept Islam, they showed rudeness. The
Prophet ~ said, "Isa (Jesus) was raised out of clay by Allah like

Prophet Muhammad ;Ji

239

Adam." "No, Jesus was the son of Allah," they contended. The
Prophet ~ said, "If you are true in your claim then come along to a
field with me and my relatives, and both the parties shall sit
separately and say: 'May the torment of Allah descend on the one
who is a liar'." Hearing this they kept silent. The next morning the
Prophet ~ took Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husain'-" with him and said
to the Christiaµs, "When I invoke Allah to send down His torment on
the one who is telling a lie, you say, 'May it be so'." The straight
forwardness of the Prophet ~ frightened them so much that they
declared: "We don't want to enter into Mubahalah." "Accept Islam if
you don't want Mubahalah, and become one with all the other
Muslims," the Prophet ~ said firmly. "We don't accept this offer
either," they replied . "Be ready then to either pay the (fizyah) tax or
measure your swords with us. "We shall pay the tax," they said. The
Prophet ~ later said, "Had they accepted the Mubahalah, they would
have been destroyed up to their hairs and nails." When going back,
they wished to have an escort sent with them. The Prophet ~ sent
Abu Ubaidha bin Al-Jarrah ~ with them and, after a short time, all
the Christians became Muslims.
All the Yemenite tribes and their ruler Badhan had already turned to
Islam. The Prophet ~ had allowed his rule to continue intact, but he
died that year. Following this, he installed Shahr bin Badhan, Amir
bin Shahr Hamdani, Abu Musa Ash'ari, Ali bin Umayyah, and
Mu'adh bin Jabal c$, as rulers of different parts of Yemen. Also, Ali~
was sent at the head of a few Companions with the instructions that
arms must not be raised against any unless it was done by others first.
He was sent with the sole purpose of collecting Zakat and charitable
donations.

T~e Farewell Pilgrimage
These events were followed by the month of Dhul-Qa'dah, 10 AH,
when the Prophet of Allah •;I; set out on the journey to the House of
Allah to perform Hajj. A large number of Companions accompanied
him with a hundred sacrificial camels. This caravan from Al-Madinah
entered Makkah on Sunday, Dhul-Hijjah 4. Ali~ joined the caravan
from Yemen and performed Hajj with the Prophet ~-

240

History of Islam

The Farewell Address
On this occasion the Prophet ~ taught his Companions the rites of
Hajj and delivered an address at Arafat. He said after praising and
glorifying Allah: "O people! Behold I am not sure of meeting you here
next year or after that. 0 people! Your blood and your property are
inviolable like the sacredness of this day in this month in this city of
yours. Do no wrong to others lest you are wronged. The Devil has lost
hope of ever being worshipped by those who pray. However, he will
be followed in lesser matters. Therefore, you should shun his
company. 0 people! You have rights on your womenfolk and they on
you. Be good to them. Behold! Whoever holds anything in trust
should return it to the person who has entrusted him with it. I leave
among you two things, one the Book of Allah and the second is the
Sunnah of His Messenger. You will not go astray while you hold to the
Book and the Sunnah. You will be asked if I have conveyed the
Message of Allah and fulfilled the mission?" "We testify that you
have conveyed the Message of Allah," the Companions replied with
one voice. The Prophet~ said, "O Allah! Be Witness."
The Prophet ~ spoke addressing his Companions in words and
manner, which are used when bidding farewell or saying good-bye.
This is why this Hajj is called the Farewell Hajj (Hajjat-ul-Wada') . More
than one hundred thousand Muslims performed their Hajj that year
under the guidance of the Prophet of Allah~- That day he also said:
"These are the best words ever spoken by any of the Prophets: 'There
is no true God except Allah Alone, Who has no partner to Him, all
praise is due for Him, He has power on every thing' ." On the day of
Arafat, the Prophet of Allah ~ was still in Makkah when the
following Verse was revealed:
"This day, I have perfected your religion for you , completed
my favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your
religion." (5:3)
Most of the Companions appeared jubilant at the revelation of the
above Verse, for they thought that their religion was perfected and
completed. But a few among them, like Abu Bakr ~, who had deeper

Prophet Muhammad ~

241

insight and wisdom, grew sad for the Verse indicated their separation
from the Prophet ~ , because the existence of the Prophethood would
, no longer be required after the perfection of the religion.

The Consolation of Ali ~
During the Hajj some of the fellows of Ali ~ who had been with him
to Yemen complained to the Prophet ~ about Ali ~ - Some of the
misunderstandings of the people of Yemen had given rise to these
misgivings. Addressing the Companions at Ghadir Khum, the
Prophet of Allah ~ said admiring Ali, "The one who is my friend is
the friend of Ali and the one who is an enemy of Ali is my enemy."
, Following the address Umar 4, congratulated Ali ~ saying, "From
this day on you are a very special friend of mine." The Prophet ~ then
came back to Al-Madinah and his son Ibrahim~ passed away.

The Eleventh Year of Migration
The Sickness of the Prophet ;i
In Muharram 11 AH, the Prophet ~ developed a temperature which
kept getting higher. When the news of his illness spread, the evildoers
had an opportunity to start their treacherous activities. Musailamah,
Tulaihah bin Khuwailid, Aswad and Sajah bint Harith all claimed
they were prophets. They thought that they would also achieve
success due to their claims like the Prophet of Allah ;i did. But Allah
the Almighty put the seal on the Prophethood of Muhammad ~ and
demonstrated it once again by driving each one of them to an
, ignominious failure and defeat for their heinous claim. Musailamah
' the liar gained notoriety in Yamamah and Aswad bin Ka'b Ansi in
i Yemen.
One day the Prophet ~ came out while sick with a bandage tied
around his head because of a headache. Addressing the Companions
he said, "Last night I saw in a dream that I had two bracelets of gold
, on my wrists and I threw them away out of dislike. I interpreted this
dream to mean that the two bracelets stand for the men of Yamamah
and Yemen (Musailamah the liar, and Aswad the liar)." Aswad the liar

242

History of Islam

was killed by a person named Firoz during the lifetime of the Prophet
of Allah ii, while Musailamah the liar was killed by Wahshi, the killer
of Hamzah ~ during the caliphate of Abu Bakr Siddiq~- Wahshi
used to say: "I have killed the best man while I was in a state of
disbelief and the worst man after 1 became a believer in Islam."

Jihad in the way of Allah from the Sick-bed:
When the Prophet ii felt a little relief on Safar 26, 11 AH, he ordered
to make hasty preparations to take on the Romans because of
menacing news from the borders of Syria and Palestine. The next day
he appointed Usamah bin Zaid bin Harithah ~ as the commander of
the Muslim detachment and said to him, "Hurry up to the land of
your father and go quickly so that they won't have time to find out
about your movements. You will be, Allah willing, crowned with
success."
Marching on the Romans was necessary because due to the events of
Yamamah and Yemen and the Christian conspiracies against Islam, it
had once again encouraged the Romans to turn against Arabia. The
departure of the Muslim troops was so necessary and so significant
that in spite of the severity of his illness, the Prophet ~ got up to fix
the standard of Usamah ~ with his own hands and let them go
ahead. He had ordered all the distinguished Companions to join the
detachment. Thus Abu Bakr, Abbas, Umar, Uthman and Ali ~ were
all going under the command of Usamah ~- However, Ali and Abbas
~ were held back in Al-Madinah to attend to the Prophet ~ during
his illness. Usamah ~ took his detachment out of Al-Madinah and
made camp at Jurf about 5 km from the city. Abu Bakr and Umar ~
would come to the Prophet ~ from there with the permission of the
army commander Usamah ~ and then go back.
In the meantime the Prophet's condition grew worse while Usamah
~ and his troops anxiously awaited the news about him. The Prophet
~ also gave his approval to their holding up at Jurf. However, some
people expressed their misgivings at the commandership of Usamah
~ because his father had once been a slave. When the Prophet~
heard about the disapproval, he summoned the people and said,
"Why there is an objection against his appointment as commander

Prophet Muhammad :JI!

243

when his father had already been the commander of previous Muslim
detachments?" He further added, "Zaid is among the foremost
Muslims and commands a place of distinction in Islam." Those raising
the objection subsided, showed their repentance and accepted
Usamah 4ik, as the commander of the Muslim detachment.

Illness increases:
The illness went on increasing day by day. The Prophet~ sought
permission from his wives to stay in the room of A.ishah ~ , which
they readily acceded to. He entered the apartment of A.ishah ~ and
then came out to say, "I tell you to fear Allah. May Allah guide you
all, I leave Him with you and entrust you to Him. I am a warner .
against Hell and a giver of glad tidings of Jannah (Paradise). Jannalz is
for those who seek not oppression in the earth, nor corruption. The
next life is for those who ward off evil. Never give yourselves to
arrogance and vainglory." After a pause the Prophet ~ said, "My
family members should wash my body," and added, "leave the spot
for a while after putting my body beside the grave so that angels may
perform their funeral prayers in groups one after another. The males
of my family should come first to perform their funeral prayers
followed by their women." The Prophet of Allah ~ lay bed-ridden for
three successive days.

Asking Abu Bakr ~ to lead the Prayers:
The Prophet ~ deputed Abu Bakr 4ik, to lead the Muslims in prayers ,
in the Prophet's Mosque. A.ishah ~ submitted, "My father is not able
to serve in this capacity for he is too tender-hearted to do this. Please
ask Umar to do the job." He said, "No, Abu Bakr will do it." Abu Bakr
~ was leading the prayer when the Prophet~ felt a bit better and
came into the mosque. As soon as Abu Bakr ~ came to know of the
Prophet's arrival, he tried to get back, but the Prophet ~ motioned for
him not to leave his place. Thus the Prophet~ led the prayer sitting
while Abu Bakr ~ was standing in the prayer. The Sahihain (Sahih
Bukhari and Sahih Muslim) report that one day, during his illness, the
Prophet of Allah ~ asked for a pen and paper. Since he was then
undergoing the intensity of his illness, Umar ~ intervened to say that

244

History of Islam

he must not be put to any trouble for the Qur'an is enough for us all
as he has already said. But some of the Companions were in favor of
letting him dictate. The Prophet :i disliked the clamor of voices and
asked the people to leave. At the time he was suffering from a violent
headache and this was the reason why Umar ~ had suggested not to
trouble him in any way. When his pain had subsided a little, he called
the people in and said, "Make it a practice to keep the visiting
deputations happy with gifts and rewards. Drive the polytheists out of
the Arabian Peninsula and send the army of Usamah ~- Show
kindness to the Ansar and forgive their mistakes and consider none
superior to Abu Bakr ~ in your assemblies." Following this he fell
unconscious again due to the pain.

A little before Death
Ali, Abbas, Fadl bin Abbas, Abu Bakr, and Umar ~ remained at the
service of the Prophet~ most of the time during his fatal illness. The
Prophet of Allah :i disliked anything to be left with him at the time of
his final departure. He, therefore, asked Aishah ~ to give away in
charity five or six dinars remaining with her. He extorted Ali ~ to
take care of the prayers and relatives. Abu Bakr ~ led thirteen
prayers in all during the Prophet's illness. On Monday, Rabi' AlAwwal 12, 11 AH, he came out with a bandage tied around his head
when Abu Bakr ~ was leading the dawn prayer. Following this he
went back home and lay down with his head in the lap of Aishah ~.
Abu Bakr ~ also left for home happy and satisfied. Just at that
moment Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr ~ entered the room with a
green toothstick (Siwak-a natural toothbrush) in his hand. The
Prophet ~ looked at it in a way that she thought he wanted it. She
then took the toothstick from her brother, chewed it a little to make it
soft and pliable, and then she gave it to him. He rubbed his teeth with
it, and then leaving it, he put his head against Aishah's breast and
stretched out his legs.

Death
A cup of water was kept near him. He dipped his hand in it and
wiped his face with it, saying, "O Allah, help me in the pangs of

Prophet Muhammad ;Ji

245

death." A.ishah ~ had been keeping her eyes fixed on his face when
his eyes became glazed saying, "With the Highest Companionship in
Jannah (Paradise)." Thus the Prophet ti passed away from this mortal
world. The news of the Prophet's death fell like a thunderbolt on his
Companions and they all were stunned.

The Condition of Umar ~
Umar ~ was so terribly shocked that he temporarily lost his senses.
He got up with his sword drawn and said at the top of his voice:
"Some of the hypocrites have developed a notion that the Messenger
of Allah ti has passed away. But, in fact, he has not died. He has
rather gone to his Lord as Moses had done. He shall come back and
cut their hands and legs." Umar ~ had gotten so emotional that
nobody had the courage to ask him to sheathe his sword. After a short
while Abu Bakr ~ arrived and went straight into the room. He took
the head of the Prophet ti in his hands, watched it and said, "May my
mother and father be sacrificed for you, verily you have tasted the
death which Allah the Almighty had decreed for you, and never will
you face any other death hereafter." He then came out saying Inna
lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji'un (to Allah do we belong and to Him do we
return) on his lips.

Firmness of Abu Bakr ~
Abu Bakr ~ asked Umar ~ to keep quiet but he paid no heed. He
then stood at a short distance from him to address the people who
now left Umar ~ to cluster round Abu Bakr~- He praised Allah
and then said: "Omen, if anyone of you worships Muhammad ti, let
him know that Muhammad ti is dead. But if anyone of you worships
Allah, then Allah is alive and He does not die." Then continuing his
speech he recited the Qur'anic Verse:
"Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed
Messengers (the like of whom) have passed away before him.
Will it be that, when he dies or is slain, you will turn back on
your heels? He who turns back does no hurt to Allah and Allah
will reward the thankful." (3:144)

246

History of Islam

All those who were present on that occasion felt pacified and their
state of shock and bewilderment subsided quickly. Umar ~ says: "At
first I paid no heed to the call of Abu Bakr. But when he recited the
Verse, it seemed as if it had just been revealed. I was taken aback and
fell down as if I had no legs. I felt as if I had just then come to know of
the Prophet's death."

Hall of Banu Sa 1 idah
Deliberations upon the new developments were going on when the
news came that the Ansiir had collected in the hall of Banu Sa'idah
and were about to take the oath of allegiance at the hand of Sa'd bin
Ubadah ~- Some of them disputed the idea of choosing two leaders,
one from the Quraish and another one from the Ansar. Abu Bakr and
Umar ~ accompanied by a group of Mulzajirin got up without losing
a moment and proceeded towards the trouble spot to put the matter
right. However, Ali, Abbas, Usamah, and Fad! bin Abbas ;i the near
relatives of the Prophet ~ were left behind to look after the burial
affairs in conformity with the instructions of the Prophet~ himself.
Ali ~ washed his body while Abbas ~ and his two sons helped
moving him from one side to the other, while Usamah ~ was
pouring water over the body.

The Funeral Prayer and Burial
The task of washing the body being over, the Companions were
divided over the place of burial. Abu Bakr ~ then said, "I have heard
from the Messenger of Allah :i that every Prophet is being buried on
the spot where he has breathed his last." The Prophet's bedding was
accordingly removed from the place and a grave was dug for him at
the same spot. The grave being completed, the people came to perform
the funeral prayer in groups one after another. The women came in
after the men and after them the children, all of whom prayed over
him. Nobody acted as an Imam for the funeral prayers of the Prophet ~On receiving the sad news of the Prophet's illness and then of his final
departure, Usamah bin Zaid ~ and his men moved back to Al-Madinah
and the military standard was placed upright at the door of the Prophet's

Prophet Muhammad !f!i

247

room. The fw1eral prayer was performed in the room of Aishah ~ ,
where his burial was to take place. Obviously, it was impossible for the
men, women and children of the entire city to perform the prayer
together. Moreover, the prayer was not to be led by an Imam. Thus it was
natural that all took some time in performing the prayers in separate
small batches in the small room. The Prophet~ passed away on Monday
and was buried the next day, on Tuesday.

Noble Features
The Prophet :i was neither very tall nor short in stature. Among the
people he appeared to rise higher than the others. His complexion
was white and reddish, head large, beard full and thick, hair black
and slightly curly and thick, sometimes touching his ear lobes and
sometimes reaching down to his shoulders. His eyes round, wide,
black, attractive, with red lines in the white parts and slanting thick
brows parted in the middle. A vein· protruded between the two
eyebrows, which became more prominent in anger. His cheeks were
even, soft and full. His teeth white and bright like pearls, and he
would never burst into laughter he would simply smile. He was of a
smiling countenance, soft-spoken, eloquent, and a man of all-round
human qualities. The Seal of Prophethood was between the two
shoulders. He used to do his work with his own hands

Children
Apart from Ibrahim ~ , who was born to Maria Qibtiyah (Copt) ~ ,
all his children were born to his first wife Khadijah ~ . First of all she
gave birth to his son Qasim ~ who died in Makkah at the age of four
years. It is after his name that the Prophet :i came to be called AbulQasim (father of Qasim). Thereafter for the Prophet~ she had Zainab
t;, followed by Abdullah~ who was surnamed as Taiyib (pure) and
Talzir (clean). She then gave birth to Ruqaiyah ~, Umm Kulthum ~
and Fatimah ~ in order. While all his sons died in infancy, all his
daughters grew up to be married. But none except the youngest
daughter Fatimah ~ was blessed with progeny. She bore four
children to Ali bin Abu Talib, Hasan, Husain, Zainab and Umm
Kulthum JJ;,,.

Character and Features
Various States and Conditions of the Prophet ~:
The Prophet :I; had become an orphan in the womb of his mother and he
began his life in hardships and difficulties. But when he departed from
this mortal world, he had the whole of Arabia under his authority and
none of the states of Arabia was beyond his control. But his simplicity,
purity and uprightness served as a guiding light throughout his life.
Bukhari reports Aishah ~ to have said, "The Prophet ~ never
preferred himself to anyone in worldly affairs. He would do his
household chores as you all do. He would milk the sheep and repair his
shoes. When the construction work of the Prophet's Mosque was being
done, the Prophet :I; also participated in the work like a common
laborer carrying bricks for the mosque. He was one of the workers
digging the trench, breaking stones and carrying clay in preparation for
the Battle of the Confederates (also known as the Battle of the Trench).
His common diet was barley bread of unsieved flour. But even the
barley was sometimes not available for days at a time. Sometimes no
fire was lighted in the hearth of his houses, and members of the
Prophet's household had to live on dates and water. He never openly
disliked any food nor criticized it. He would eat from whatever was
served to him and held himself back when he wasn't hungry or when
the food was disagreeable to him."
When Aishah ~ was asked about his bedding she related, "It was
made of coarse animal skin filled with date-bark." When the same
question was repeated to Hafsah ~, she said, "It was just a piece of
sackcloth. One night I folded it in four parts to make it more
comfortable for the Prophet ~. The next morning he asked as to what I
had spread as the bedding. I told him that it was the same piece of
sackcloth, but I had folded it in four parts to give him more comfort.
The Prophet ~ asked me to make it as it was because it held him back
from performing the night prayer."
The Prophet's coat of mail had been pawned with a Jew in return for
30 dirhams but he didn't have enough money to get it back from him.

Prophet Muhammad Ji

249

The Messenger of Allah ti departed from the world and the coat of
mail was still with the Jew. He left his weapons, a mule and a coat of
mail as inheritance but with the instructions that these things were to
be given in charity.
Are they not blind who accuse him of lifting his sword against his
own people for (Allah forbid) personal gain, sensual desire, for
power, wealth or for fulfilling a lust for territorial gain?
Anas .;$., says, "I came to the Prophet ti when I was only 8 years old
and served the Prophet of Allah ti for 10 years. During such a long
time he never uttered a painful word nor blamed me for doing
anything wrong."
Abu Hurairah ~ relates that once the people said to him, "Please
invoke on the polytheists, the curse of Allah." He replied, "I have not
been sent to invoke the curse of Allah; I have rather been sent by
Allah as mercy for mankind."
Aishah ~ says, "His taste and temperament had nothing to do with

,nonsensical things." He would lift children in his lap to play with
Ithem, go to far off places to fulfill the needs of the sick. He would be
' the first to salute others and never pulled his hand back after a
handshake before the other did. He would call his Companions with
their surnames out of respect and addressed them with suitable and
likeable names. He would never cut in while anybody was talking.
However, he would forbid anyone from talking nonsense or he would
get up to stop it.

Cheerful and Perfect Manners:
Abdullah bin Harith ~ says, "I have never seen a person more
cheerful than the Messenger of Allah ti." As per his saying, "The
strong man is not one who knocks another down but the one who
controls himself when his anger reaches its peak."
Anas ~ said, "He was the bravest of all. Once the people of AlMadinah found themselves in an unknown terror thinking it an
invasion from the enemy. The people followed the commotion. But the
panic-stricken people found to their utmost wonder that the Prophet ti

250

History of Islam

was already returning from the center of the trouble riding bareback
on a horse. He came across them on the way and pacified the people
saying, "Don't worry; there is nothing to fear."
Bara' bin .A.zib ~ states, "The people fled the field on the day of
Hunain, while the Prophet :i was going forward reciting the martial
lines: 'I am surely the Prophet, I am son of Abdul-Muttalib.' None was
more valiant and courageous than he on that day. We took refuge
behind him from forceful attacks. The one who could bear the charge
of the enemy being beside the Prophet :i on the battlefield was
considered the bravest among us."
Anas ~ relates, "Once I was walking with the Prophet~ who was
wearing a cloak with a coarse fringe, a bedouin met him and violently
tugged his cloak. I saw that the man's tugging had left a mark on the
neck and shoulder of Allah's Prophet ~- When the Prophet ~ turned
towards him, the nomad said, "O Muhammad, give me two camels
loaded with what Allah has given you, for it neither belongs to you
nor your father." The Prophet ~ kept silent out of his grace and
politeness despite such rude and bitter words. Then speaking rather
softly, he said to the nomad, "Should you be treated as you have
treated me?" "No," the nomad said emphatically. "Why not?" The
Prophet ~ asked. "It is because you don' t believe in tit for tat," he
very confidently replied . The Prophet :i smiled at his plain talking
and then ordered to load one of his camels with barley and another
with dates."
Once Zaid bin Sa'nah, a Jew came to the Prophet ~ and demanded
payment of the money owed by the Prophet :i and addressed him
rudely, saying, "You son of Abdul-Muttalib are late." Although the
Prophet ii kept smiling at his rudeness, Umar ~ rebuked and
reproached him . Thereupon the Prophet :l; said to Umar ~, "This
man was entitled to better treatment from you. You ought to have
advised me to repay the loan promptly and asked him to make his
demand politely." At the same time he asked Umar ~ to pay the loan
and give Zaid twenty Sa' (60 kilograms) extra so as to compensa te
him for his threatening attitude towards Zaid . The gracious and
obliging behavior of Allah's Prophet ~ caused Zaid to embrace Islam
then and there.

Prophet Muhammad J!i

251

Anas ~ relates, "I accompanied the Prophet :i to Abu Saif, the smith
whose wife would suckle his son, Ibrahim~, who was then on the
brink of death. This sad plight brought tears to the eyes of the Prophet
~- Thereupon Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ said, "Do you also show
impatience, 0 Prophet of Allah?" The Prophet :i replied, "O Ibn Auf,
these are the tears of mercy and affection, not of impatience and
thanklessness. The heart saddens and the eyes shed tears, but we
must not say anything that goes against the Will of Allah."
Abu Khudri ~ relates, "Once some people from the Ansar asked for
something from the Prophet :i and he gave them. He gave all he had,
when they repeated their demands, the Prophet :i remarked, 'I never
lay aside whatever comes to me. Verily, Allah the Almighty saves
those from the disgrace of asking for something who beg Allah for it;
Allah makes rich those who long for it; Allah makes them patient who
keep patience; and none has ever been given a better gift from Allah
than patience'."
Abu Hurairah ~ states, 'The Prophet :i has said more than once: 'If I
had gold equal to Mount Uhud, I would feel happy only when I had
distributed all of it before the end of three days. I keep nothing with
me save what is necessary for the repayment of a loan'."
The Prophet :i would rise to help the needy even when he had
nothing to give. In such a situation he helped by borrowing from
others, even when he already had loans of the same nature, otherwise
he never borrowed anything from anybody for his own personal
needs.
Jabir bin Abdullah ~ relates, "I accompanied the Prophet :ion an
expedition. My camel lagged behind because of exhaustion. After a
short while the Prophet :i passed by and asked, 'How are you Jabir?'
I told him, 'My camel is exhausted.' He hit my camel and it sped up.
Then we moved ahead talking with each other. During this exchange
he asked me, 'Will you sell the camel.' I replied in the affirmative.
Thus he bought it from me and moved ahead. I reached the
destination late in the day. I tied it to the door of the mosque. 'Leave it
there and come in to perform two Rak'ah of prayer,' the Prophet :i
said to me. The prayer being over, he asked Bilal~ to make payment

252

History of Islam

for the camel. When I moved a little with the amount, he called me
back. I was afraid if the camel was to be returned. But on my return he
said, 'Take the camel with you along with its price, which has already
been paid to you'."
Once the Prophet ~ was passing through a grove along with a
person. He cut two toothsticks one straight and another bent. He took
the bent one and gave the straight one to his companion. Although he
insisted on him (the Prophet~) to take the straight one, the Prophet
~ refused saying that everyone will on the Day of Judgment be asked
about his etiquette with the company he has passed sometime with.
Ibn Abbas ~ relates that once some dispute arose between a
hypocrite Muslim named Bishr and a Jew. Both of them came to the
Prophet ~ for a verdict. After hearing both of them and looking into
the matter, he gave his verdict in favor of the Jew. When they came
out, Bishr said, "The verdict is not fair; let us go to Umar." Both of
them went to him. The Jew stated before Umar ~: "Both of us have
gone to the Prophet and he gave his verdict in my favor, but this man
(Bishr) didn't accept it and has now brought me to you to seek and
accept that of yours." Umar ~ verified the statement of the Jew with
Bishr who said, "This is a fact that we had gone to the Prophet for his
verdict in the dispute but now I seek to prefer your verdict to that of
his." Umar ~ said, "Just wait, and I will give my verdict right away."
He went into his house and came out with his sword and cut off the
head of the hypocrite Bishr, and remarked, "Anyone who rejects the
decision of Allah and His Messenger ~ after claiming himself a
Muslim, I decide his matter in this manner." Following this his
hypocrite fellows raised much hue and cry against this action but
Allah the Almighty lent support to this decision of Umar ~ through
His Revelation, and it is said that from that day he came to be called
'Faruq'.

After the conquest of Makkah, Fatimah bint Al-Aswad of Banu
Makhzum was apprehended on the charge of theft. The Prophet ~
ordered to cut off the right hand of the culprit after her crime was
proved. The notables among the Quraish felt this was disgraceful.
They wanted to save her from punishment by virtue of intercession,
but none of them had the courage to go before the Prophet ~ with this

Prophet Muhammad j!j

253

purpose in view. At last they approached Usamah bin Zaid ~ to
Intercede with the Prophet ~ on the issue. When he brought the
111atter to the notice of Prophet~, his expression completely altered.
f-Ie said, 'Usamah! Do you speak to me about the limits set by Allah?"
fie got up then and addressed the people saying, "The people before
were destroyed because they used to overlook when a highborn
pr a man of substance among them committed a theft, but when the
poor or the weak did the same, they chastised him as ordained by the
law. I swear by Him Who holds my life, if Fatimah bint Muhammad
~ad committed this theft, I would have amputated her hand."

rou

~nformality:
Pnce the Prophet ~ said: "Keep away from praising me beyond a
~imit like the Christians who crossed all limits in adoring Isa bin
Maryam. I am one of the slaves of Allah, so call me Abdullah (the
b1ave of Allah)."
I

Once the Prophet ~ came out and all the Companions got up to pay
their respect to him. Thereupon he said, "Do away with the practice of
~tanding up to adore anyone like the Ajami people (non-Arabs)."
[He would keep very close to his Companions and took his seat
;wherever he found a place. He took part in the work done by the
servants and made them sit beside him.
jH e has said that one who endeavors to do the needful for the hungry
:and
the poor, attains the status of one who fights in the way of Allah,
I
!and one who prays the whole night and observes fast the whole year.

:A certain person called on the Prophet ~ and asked, "O Prophet of
iAllah, what is the way to Jannah (Paradise)?" He said, "Truth. It is

:because when a person is truthful, he adopts virtue, which leads to
,the light of Faith, and Faith leads him to Jannah (Paradise)." On
:another occasion he said, "Keep truthful even if your truth leads you
:to face death and destruction, for undoubtedly it is where salvation
'rests."

iOnce, on the way to Badr from Makkah, Akhnas bin Shuraiq said to
iAbu Jahl, "O Abul-Hakam, I ask you one thing, and none is here

254

History of Islam

except we two; tell me truthfully whether Muhammad is truthful or a
liar." Abu Jahl replied, "By God, Muhammad always speaks the truth
and he never uttered anything untrue."
Abu Saeed Khudri ~ is reported to have said, "The Prophet~ was
more modest than a graceful and veiled virgin. We read from his face
the sign of his displeasure. When he disliked anything, he would
indicate it indirectly so that the person was not shamed. However, he
made no concessions in matters of the Word of Allah and the
upholding of the Truth."

Moderation:

A.ishah $., related that when the Prophet~ said anything of anyone,
he never mentioned the person by name. He would rather say, "What
type of person are those who do such things." Most of the time he
kept silent and never talked unnecessarily; his speech was always
clear and lucid, neither so long as to contain loose substance nor so
short as to exclude some essential points. His movement was
moderate, neither so slow as to become undesirable to others in his ·
company nor so fast to cause exhaustion. In short, he practiced
moderation in every aspect of life.

Cheerful Disposition:
He radiated cheerfulness. Once he promised to give someone a camel.
When that person asked for it, he~ said, "l can give you the calf of a
she camel." "What shall I do with the calf?" the person said with a
touch of disappointment. Thereupon he :i said, "If a camel is not the
calf of a she-camel, whose calf is it?" But the Prophet :l; never uttered '
a word of untruth even during casual talk.

Laudable Traits of Character:
When the Prophet :i was in the company of his Companions, he was,
so close to them that a newcomer wouldn't recognize him distinctly:
and would ask for the Prophet :i to be pointed out to him. He did not
like to eat anything that might cause a bad smell to emit from hi~
mouth. He wore clothes with patches; he liked simple but clean

Prophet Muhammad J!i

255

[garments. He used a toothstick several times a day. The people sitting
)beside him never complained of his body, clothes or mouth emitting a
[bad smell. He sought forgiveness between parties where it could be
jhelpful in bringing about reforms, but in case of crimes demanding
:punishment, he never held himself back, because refraining from
!chastising the criminals was to him tantamount to aiding and abetting
;in promoting crimes.
Charities from Muslims were not limited to the Muslims, he extended
it to the Christians, Jews and polytheists too. He put up with
exemplary ease whatever calamities befell him but he became restless
ito find anybody else in trouble. He applied all sources and resources
in accomplishing any job but left the outcome to Allah the Almighty,
and he was least afraid of the result going against his hope. He
'showed humility but not meanness; he was awesome but not rude
and rash; he practiced generosity but not extravagance; whoever came
,before him, all of a sudden felt awe-stricken but when seated beside
ihim, began to love him. He asked to keep away from epidemics,
! forbade quacks to treat patients and disliked
the use of prohibited
things as medicine. Whenever he had two ways to do a thing, he used
the easier one. He served the prisoners of war like his guests. He took
'part in manly sports and exercises like archery, shooting, and horse
racing along with his Companions.

Chapter 3

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

Caliph and Caliphate
Caliph means successor and caliphate means the succession of rule, and
in historian's terminology, caliph approximates the words king,
monarch or ruler. It is not at all necessary that before dealing with the
events of Abu Bakr's caliphate after the Prophet ~ , a historian should
devote his time and space in discussing the word caliph or caliphate.
But since the succession of Prophet ~ has taken the form of an ethical
issue between two sections, the task of a historian has become rather
difficult. Moreover, it has also become incumbent on the historians to
put forward their own point of view and belief concerning the
caliphate before embarking upon the topic of the Rightly-Guided
Caliphate.
Wherever the word Khalifah (caliph) appears in the Qur'an, it is
immediately followed by the word Al-Ard (earth). Moreover it is
proved beyond doubt from the Verse:
"I am going to place generation after generation on earth." (2:30)
Allah the Almighty has appointed Adam and the children of Adam,
as His caliph on earth. It is also abundantly clear that the children of
Adam are the most eminent of all created beings and their being

258

History of Islam

rulers on earth is beyond doubt. The caliphate of men on earth is
certainly a Divine caliphate and man is the caliph of Allah . Allah the
Exalted is far above any creature including the most eminent of the
created beings that becomes His vice-regent on earth. So, man can be
nothing more than the apparent ruler of the earth and makes all other
creatures obey His rule. It is clear now that in Verse 2:30. The word
caliph stands for 'generation after generation' or 'ruler' and for
nothing else. The Qur'a n says at another place:
"He it is Who has made you successors on the earth, and He
has raised you in ranks, some above others." (6:165)
Here caliphate stands for something specific, your people have been
made ruler, and all other people are to be ruled by you. Here also the
word 'caliph' makes its appearance, which gives the meaning of
nothing but a 'ruler'. Again, it has been mentioned in another Verse:
"O Dawud! Verily, we have placed you as a successor on
earth." (38:26)
Here also, the rule or empire of a person, Dawud ~ I, finds mention
and the word caliph signifies a king, monarch or ruler. About the
same rule of Dawud ~\, it has been said at another place:
"We made his kingdom strong." (38:20)
Regarding the Muslims and particularly about the Companions it has
been said:
"Allah has promised those among you who believe and do
righteous good deeds that He will certainly grant them succession
in the earth as He granted it to those before th em." (24:55)
It means: As We have installed others as rulers in the past, so also

those among the followers of the Prophet ~, who believed and
performed good deeds, will be conferred upon the rule on earth.

Claim to Caliphate
From the Qur'an it becomes clear beyond doubt that rule or caliphate
on earth is from Allah and He Alone can take it back.
It is said:

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

259

"O Allah! Possessor of the kingdom, You give the kingdom to
whom You will, and You take the kingdom from whom You
will." (3:26)
Now it is to be seen as to who really deserves the caliphate or rule,
and what are the distinctive signs of those who are given caliphate.
According to the Qur'an, it is knowledge on which the rule over
mankind is based .
"And He taught Adam all the names (of everything)." (2:31)
While the angels considered the traits of corruption and disruption
against a righteous caliphate, and the mention and glorification of
Allah the Almighty to be the consideration for making one deserve
the caliphate. We have seen clearly that human beings established
their rule over other creatures due to their power of knowledge only.
Had man not been adorned and strengthened with deep and wide
knowledge, even a gust of wind, a wave of water, a leaf of some tree
or a particle of dust could have rendered him helpless. It is by virtue
of his knowledge that even a lion, an elephant, river, mountain, wind,
fire, and lightening are at his service and are ready to obey him and
comfort him like his servants. The Qur'an informs us when there were
objections to the kingship of Talut (Saul), Allah the Almighty
answered the detractors through His Prophet:
"Verily Allah has chosen him above you and has increased him
abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His
kingdom to whom He wills." (2:247)
Having conferred rule and caliphate on Dawud ~I, Allah the
Almighty commanded
"So judge you between men in truth and follow not your
desire." (38:26)
In another Verse, He said:
"And indeed We destroyed generations before you when they
did wrong, while their Messengers came to them with clear
proofs, but they were not such as to believe! That do We requite
the people who are sinners. Then We made you successors after

260

History of Islam

them, generations after generations in the land that We might
see how you would work." (10:13,14)
Hundreds of Verses from the Qur'an may be produced to establish
that caliph stands for 'ruler' and caliphate for 'rule'. And in order to
rule establishing knowledge, justice, reform, power and welfare of
mankind are some of the prerequisite conditions, which have always
been required from a king or ruler without which he cannot keep his
rule intact. All these good qualities can only be obtained through the
teachings of the Prophets and the Messengers of Allah. However, it is
also necessary that a Prophet has to be a ruler in order to set the
example. Had mere prayers and glorification of Allah the Almighty
been enough, only Prophets or angels would have ruled the world . In
short, the caliphate is another name for the rule which Allah the
Almighty confers on those He wants. However, when a ruling nation
indulges in corruption and wrongdoing, Allah the Almighty takes it
away from them.

Islamic Caliphate
All the progress made by mankind so far along with all his academic
and moral virtues are the outcome of the teachings of the Prophets.
Prophets have sometimes came as teachers, for instance, like Isa ~ \
(Jesus Christ), and at times as monarchs like Dawud (David)~\. The
religious codes brought by monarch-Prophets are more perfect and
magnificent than those of the teacher-Prophets. The teacher-Prophets
set examples for every member of their Ummah (community) while
the monarch-Prophets not only set examples but have the power to
enforce codes and make the people follow them. When the teacherProphet departs from the world after finishing his task, none can
succeed him in matters of Prophethood, for the Prophet receives
Revelation from Allah the Almighty to convey to his people.
Now as a matter of general principle, the successor of a Prophet must
be a Prophet. But since a Prophet departs from the world only after
completing the task assigned to him, he needs no successor after him.
This is why no teacher-Prophet has ever had a successor. However, as
far as a monarch-Prophet is concerned, nobody can succeed him as a
Prophet but his rule may be succeed by anybody as a successor. Since

i

~he successor would have been brought up under the shadow of the
rrophet' s teachings, he is supposed to be the most suitable person to
o the job. Since Muhammad~ was the perfect and the last Prophet
nd had been sent with the complete guidelines, he was, therefore, a
uling-Prophet and his rule is the best and most perfect example for
ulers and leaders to the Day of Judgment.

f
i

Be was essentially supposed to have a successor or caliph after him,
~nd there actually have been many who have succeeded him in
~emporal affairs. In addition, there were those among them who were
~rought up in the mould of the Prophet ~ and had the stamp of
!Prophetic character and adopted the pattern of his Prophetic rule.
ITheir rule came to be called the Rightly-Guided Caliphate. But the
farther they happened to be from the days of Prophetic rule, their
aliphate showed a difference from that of the primary example.

Objection to the Procedure of electing a Caliph
/After the time of the Prophet ~' some people among the Muslims
Jraised doubts of a ridiculous nature regarding the procedure adopted
jfor electing a caliph. But, in truth, all such charges are false and
ifabricated for the choice of a ruler or caliph rests wholly and solely
with Allah the Almighty. He Alone gives it to someone and takes it
)
away from others. He never left this job to any human.
1
I

jThe Qur'an delineates the task of a caliph and its dos and don'ts. It
Jgives detailed guidance about the prayer, fasting, Hajj, Zakat, the
jrights of Allah and His servants but doesn't mention the succession of
!the Prophet. This is because He gives it to the one He chooses for the
job and makes arrangements for this. Allah the Almighty Alone
who deserves the job. The one who succeeded the first caliph
knows
/
i was the one whom Allah chose for the job. If any other person is
1brought forward as the most deserving for the post, in fact, it is to say
1
, that Allah the Almighty failed to bring a man of His choice for the
j post. It means He (Allah forbid) was defeated in His Plan.
I

I

IThus to raise a dispute in this matter is tantamount to objecting to the

!choice of the Almighty. Thus, the detractors of Abu Bakr's caliphate
j are like those who object to the decision of a judge in a court of law,

262

History of Islam

the judge cannot alter his judgment because of their deprecation. Now
if anybody disapproves of the caliphate of a person, in fact, he stands
against the Judgment of Allah the Exalted and Most High.

Difference between Caliphate and Temporal Rule
The above discussion may create misunderstanding that if the caliphate
is simply like temporal rule then any king may be called a caliph and
caliphate has nothing to do with religion. But, let it be known that in
Islam the caliph is strictly one who patterns his rule according to the
rule established by the Prophet of Allah ~ and only such a ruler may
be included among the successors of the Messengers.
The first and foremost duty of the successor of the Prophet ~ as a
ruler is to establish a rule according to the Divine code and enforce it.
Such a ruler alone can serve humanity in the best possible way
observing the laws and tenets of Islam.
Thus to say that the caliphate has nothing to do with Islam is
something nonsensical. A despotic ruler can never bring peace and
welfare to mankind. The rule established by the righteous caliphs was
based on the example set by the Prophet ~ himself. And before or
after that no rule was similar to that which was set up by the Prophet
~- This rule was called the Rightly-Guided Caliphate. Ever since that
system of governance, Islamic rule has been continuing but the set up
has kept changing with the passage of time.

Relation of Caliphate with a Nation, Tribe or Family
The Qur'an clearly and unequivocally says:
"O people: We created you of a single man and woman and made
of you separate families and tribes to know each distinctively
from others. To Allah the most honorable is the one who is
most God-fearing; Allah is All-Knowing and Aware." (49:13)
Islam has tried to carve out one nation by doing away with family
pride, national superiority and vanity.
"The believers are nothing else than brothers." (49:10)

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

263

He has made one brotherhood of all brotherhoods and one nation of
all nations and gave its name as Muslim or Momin (believers).
Families and nations of the entire world may be divided in two
categories following the teachings of Islam; believers or Muslims and
disbelievers or polytheists. After making entry into the realm of
1 Tnuhid (Oneness of Allah), all such differences of nations and tribes are
a mere source of recognizing clearly one from another. Thus the pious
and righteous alone deserve honor and power whichever nation or tribe
they belong to.

IIn each case, piety and faith lie at the base. For wielding power, Allah
the Almighty has put knowledge, health, physical strength, piety,
justice and reform as prerequisite conditions but no particular nation
or tribe finds a place in such a list. Islam made a high-ranking man of
the Quraish to become the victim of the youngsters of Al-Madinah,
and made Bilal ~, the Abyssinian slave, superior to the nobles of
1
Arabia. Usamah bin Zaid ~ -?,e came the ~ommander of an army with
both Abu Bakr and Umar ~ under his command. Islam made the
1
: king and the slave stand side by side with the same rank.

I
I

I Islam made the Prophet ~ to declare that if Fatimah ~ , his own
daughter committed theft, her hand would be amputated like any

j other person committing the same crime. Islam made the Prophet of

Allah ~ to announce: "O people! If an ordinary Abyssinian slave is
made your ruler or caliph, you must obey him." It was Islam, which
made Umar ~ to say in the last moments of his life, "Had Salim, the
slave of Abu Hudhaifah been alive, I would have appointed him my
successor." In short, Islam broke to pieces the idols of family and
hereditary arrogance. It was a unique, exclusive and spectacular
i service that Islam rendered to the world of humanity. Islam has a right to
take pride in that no other religion or set of laws was ever able to
cause the idol of hereditary arrogance to shake even a little, while
Islam pulled it down.

I

I

How strange that even the Muslims following the tenets of Islam are
found saying that the Prophet :I had made caliphate the special
privilege of the Quraish tribes or Banu Hashim or Ali ~ or his
progeny and deprived all others of this right. Had it been so, the
Qur'an would have expounded it in unequivocal terms and the

264

History of Islam

Prophet of Allah :I would have defined it in clear words. If a
particular section claims that Allah the Almighty had sent down any
orders regarding the rule or caliphate which were cleverly concealed
by the usurpers of the caliphate, then, Allah's Claim of preserving the
Qur'an would be rendered 'false' as He has said:
"Verily, We it is Who have sent down the Qur'an and surely,
We will guard it (from corruption)." (15:9)
Moreover, His Messenger ~ would have failed in his duty of
conveying the Message of Allah fully and adequately, although he
declared before a huge congregation of one hundred thousand people
that he had completed the task of his preaching and asked the people to
testify to it. Furthermore, he counseled his people concerning very
small details from his deathbed but told them nothing about his
successor.
It is because he knew very well that the act of choosing a ruler or
caliph rested exclusively with Allah and He did not entrust this duty
to the Prophet~- However, inspiration from Allah the Almighty had
already let him know who was going to succeed him as caliph.
Therefore, he asked Abu Bakr ~ to lead the Muslims in prayers
during his illness. He had also counseled the Muhajiri11 to take care of
the Ansar for he, perhaps, knew that the caliphate was to be entrusted
to the Muhajirin. From the knowledge gained from Allah, he had
already disclosed that Imam will come from the Quraish. But all these
were among his prophecies, not his orders. The Quraish were chosen
for shouldering the heavy but very delicate burden of the caliphate
because they had a very profound knowledge of the workings of
Islam and they were ahead of all in observing piety. However, the
caliphate or rule is not particular to any certain race, tribe or family. It
is the reward of Allah for the deserving. When a ruling class or family
loses its integrity and capability, Allah the Almighty brings someone
else to replace it. And this is the demand of justice.

The Caliphate and Spiritual Guidance as a Profession
Some people are of the opinion that the caliphate referred to in Surat
An-Nur deals with the system of spiritual guidance as a profession. To

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

265

me it is an utterly wrong belief. Although a spiritual guide rules over
his disciples, he has no power to enforce the Islamic code and Divine
order. The Qur'an has left nothing to guesswork by referring in clear
terms to the caliphates of Adam and Dawud. We are ordained to
follow the Qur'an in all walks of life.

Abu Bakr Siddiq ~
His Name and Genealogy:
His family lineage is Abdullah bin Abu Quhafah bin Amir bin Amr
bin Ka'b bin Sa'd bin Tamim bin Murrah bin Ka'b bin Luai bin Ghalib
bin Fihr bin Malik bin Nadr bin Kinanah. Murrah serves as the
meeting ground for the lineage of the Prophet :i and Abu Bakr ~'
and both of them have a distance of 6 generations.
His mother was Salma bint Sakhr bin Ka'b bin Sa'd. She was the
cousin of Abu Quhafah and was widely known as Umm-ul-Khair.
The name of his father, Abu Quhafah was Uthman. Abu Bakr~ was
called Abd Ka'bah in the Days of Ignorance. The Prophet :i named
him Abdullah, and his name was Atiq also. However, Jalaluddin
Suyuti writes in his book Tarikh AI-Khulafa: "The majority of Ulama '
(religious scholars) is of the opinion that Atiq was his surname, not
his name." To some, he was called Atiq because of his being
handsome and graceful while others argue that since his genealogy
was spotless, he was known as Atiq.
There is a complete consensus among the true followers of Islam that
his surname was Siddiq, for he testified to the Prophethood without
any hesitation and fear and took it upon himself to follow the truth.
When the event of Mi'raj (Ascension) occurred, he showed his
unshakable firmness and conviction to lend his support to it and did
it in the face of all opposition. He was younger than the Prophet :i by
two years and two months. He was born and brought up in Makkah.
He would go on journeys with trade caravans. He migrated to AlMadinah along with the Prophet ~ and embraced death in the same
city.

Age of Ignorance:
During the Age of Ignorance, the power and nobility of the Quraish
were shared by ten clans: (1) Hashim, (2) Umayyah, (3) Naufal, (4)
Abdud-Dar, (5) Asad (6) Taim, (7) Makhzum, (8) Adi, (9) Jumh and
(10) Sahm. These clans were entrusted with different jobs to do. Banu
Hashim had it as their right to provide water to the pilgrims. Banu
Naufal had the right to give provisions to those who happened to be
in need of it. Banu Abdud-Dar had the key of the Ka'bah along with
guarding it. Banu Asad had to give counsel and maintain Dar AnNadwah (the House of Assembly). Banu Taim decided about blood
money and penalties. Banu Adi had intertribal ambassadorship
responsibilities, Banu Jumh had the arrows of omen and Banu Sahm
managed offerings to idols.
Abu Bakr ~ would give his judgment about blood money and
penalties on behalf of Banu Taim and the entire Quraish had to abide
by his decision. Besides, Abu Bakr ~ was the chief of his clan and
wielded deep influence as a man of substance. Among the Quraish, he
commanded distinction for his wide responsibilities and for
entertaining guests on a large scale. They took his counsel in their
important affairs and he was regarded highly for his prudence,
patience and firmness. He was well-versed in the art of genealogy. He
naturally kept away from evil and depravity. When asked if he had
ever drunk wine, he curtly replied, "Allah forbid, never!" "Why not?"
the person asked. "I hated that my body would emit foul smells and
happen the loss of good manners." When the matter was stated in the
presence of the Prophet~, he said twice, "Abu Bakr is true."
Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ was the embodiment of good and was spotless,
just and righteous. It is because of this that when the Prophet ~
invited him to accept Islam, he embraced it without delay and
promised to lend all help and total support, which he fulfilled in the
face of all opposition and extreme hardship and misery. The Prophet
:i; once said, "The sun never rose over anyone better than Abu Bakr
except the Prophets." Since he attributed such great respect, many
including Uthman bin Affan, Talhah bin Ubaidullah and Sa'd bin Abu
Waqqas ::.~ accepted Islam under his direct influence.

268

History of Islam

Islamic Era:
Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ was the first to believe in the Prophet ~ and was
the first to perform prayers led by the Prophet~- Somebody asked
Maimun bin Mehran, "Who is better in your opinion, Abu Bakr or
Ali?" He became angry and very indignantly uttered, "I never knew
that I would remain alive until the day these two would be compared
with each other. They were, in fact, like the head of Islam. Abu Bakr
was the first to accept Islam among the adults, Ali among the boys
and Khadijah among the women."
The religious scholars are unanimous that Abu Bakr~ never left the
company of the Prophet ~ without his permission. He migrated for
the sake of his love for Allah and His Messenger ~ leaving his wife
and children alone and stayed with the Prophet ~ in the cave and
accompanied him in every battle. In the battle of Badr, the Prophet :is
said about Abu Bakr and Ali ~, "One has Jibril (Gabriel) and another
Mika'il (Michael) with them." In the battle of Badr, his son AbdurRahman bin Abu Bakr had joined the polytheist army. Once after
accepting Islam, he said to his father, "Several times on the day of
Badr you came within the range of my arrows but I held my hand
back." Thereupon Abu Bakr~ replied, "If I had to face you, I would
have made you the target of my arrow."

Valor:
Once Ali ~ put the question, "Who is the most valiant person to
you?" "You are the most valiant," they replied with one voice. "I
always take on my equals; this is not bravery," Ali~ replied and
said again, "Tell me the name of the most valiant person." "We don't
know," all of them replied. "Abu Bakr is the most valiant," Ali~
replied and added, "On the day of Badr we had erected a hut for the
Messenger of Allah ~- We then asked each other as to who will
accompany the Prophet ~ to save him from the onslaught of the
polytheists. By Allah none of us had the courage to offer his services.
But Abu Bakr stood alone drawing his sword and allowed no one to
draw near the Prophet ~, and whoever attempted an attack on the
Prophet ~' came under the charge of Abu Bakr. The polytheists of

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

269

Makkah once surrounded the Prophet ~ saying, 'It is you alone who
says God is One. No one else has ever said so.' They were dragging him
when Abu Bakr stepped forward and set about beating and moving
them and saying, 'Woe to you, you want to kill a person who simply
says: my God is One'." Saying this, Ali~ burst into tears and further
said, "Tell me whether the believing men of Al-Firaun (family of
Pharaoh) are better or Abu Bakr?" When the people made no answer,
he himself said, "Why don't you reply? By Allah, a moment of Abu
Bakr is far better than a thousand moments of those people, for they
kept their Faith concealed and Abu Bakr brought his Faith to the fore ."

Generosity:
He was the most generous among the Companions of the Prophet ~ It was about him that the following Verses were sent down:
"The pious will be far removed from it (Hell). He who spends
his wealth for increase in self-purification." (92:17, 18)
The Prophet of Allah ~ said, "The wealth of Abu Bakr proved more
useful to me than the wealth of anybody else." Having heard this,
Abu Bakr ~ burst into tears and said, "What is the worth of my
wealth, it is all because of you."
As per one Hadith, the Prophet~ spent from the wealth of Abu Bakr
Siddiq ~ as he did from his own. The day Abu Bakr ~ accepted
Islam, he possessed forty thousand dirhams, and he spent this all on
the Prophet ~One day Umar ~ said referring to the expedition ofTabuk, "When the
Prophet ~ urged upon his Companions to donate to the war fund, I
resolved to surpass Abu Bakr in the matter of contribution and I gave
away half of my wealth and property in the way of Allah. The
Prophet ~ inquired of me, 'What have you left for the children?' I
submitted 'The remaining half.' In the meantime, Abu Bakr came in
with his entire wealth and property and the Prophet~ put to him the
same question. He replied, 'Allah and His Messenger are enough for
the children.' Having seen and heard this, I said to myself that I would
never be able to surpass Abu Bakr in anything."

270

History of Islam

Abu Hurairah ~ relates that the Prophet~ once said, "I have done a
good turn in return for everyone's favor but the obligation of Abu
Bakr still rests on my shoulders and Allah the Almighty will, on the
Day of Judgment, compensate for it. The wealth and property of none
benefited me so much as did that of Abu Bakr."

Knowledge and Excellences:
Among the Companions, he was the most learned and wise.
Whenever some difference of opinion arose among the Companions,
the issue was put before Abu Bakr Siddiq ~- His ruling was
considered as final. He had knowledge of the Qur'an more than all
others, and so the Prophet ~ asked him to lead the Muslims in
prayers. He also had perfect knowledge of the Sunnah and the
Companions turned to him for his opinion.
His memory was also very strong and he happened to be very
sagacious. He enjoyed the sacred company of the Prophet ~ right
from the beginning of his Prophethood until his final departure.
During his caliphate whenever an issue came up, he turned to the
Qur'an for the solution. If he failed to find it in the Qur'an, he gave his
verdict according to the sayings and doings of the Prophet ~- If any
such saying or doing was not known, he would ask the Companions
if anyone of them knew any Haditlz concerning the issue. If nothing
was known about the issue in question, he called a meeting of the
illustrious Companions and took a decision according to the opinion
of the majority.
Abu Bakr ~ was the greatest genealogist of the Quraish and one of
the greatest in the whole of Arabia. Even Jubair bin Mut'im ~' one of
the most noted genealogists of Arabia, learned it from Abu Bakr~He was also an eminent interpreter of dreams and he interpreted
dreams even during the lifetime of the Prophet ~ - He was also the
most eloquent speaker among the Companions of the Prophet ~Scholars are agreed that Abu Bakr and Ali ~ were the most eloquent.
Ali ~ has said more than once that Abu Bakr ~ was the most
excellent among the Companions of the Prophet ~- Ali ~ once said,
"I shall beat the person who holds me superior to Abu Bakr and

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

271

Umar." Ali ~ relates that the Prophet ~ said, "May Allah show
mercy to Abu Bakr, he gave his daughter to me in marriage, escorted
me to Al-Madinah and gave Bilal freedom from slavery. May Allah
show mercy to Umar for he speaks the truth no matter how bitter it
might be; may Allah show mercy to Uthman for even angels observe
modesty before him; may Allah show mercy to Ali and keep truth
along with him wherever he may be."
Imam Shafi'i says, "Siddiq was unanimously chosen as caliph for a
better man was not available on earth ." Mu'awiyah bin Qurrah ~
opines: "The Companions never expressed any doubt regarding the
caliphate of Abu Bakr and they always addressed him as the caliph of
the Messenger of Allah ~, and the Companions can never reach a
consensus on a misdeed."

Beautiful Living:
Ata' bin Sa'ib ~ states: "The day after the oath of allegiance (Bai'ah) ,
Abu Bakr ~ was seen going to the market with two sheets. 'Where
are you going?' Umar ~ inquired of him. To the market,' he replied.
'You should leave this business for you have now become the Leader
of the believers,' Umar ~ argued. 'From where will my wife and
children and myself eat?' Abu Bakr ~ asked. 'Leave it to Abu
Ubaidah ~ ,' Umar ~ said. Following this, both of them called on
Abu Ubaidah ~- Abu Bakr ~ said to him, 'Collect from the
Muhajirin a maintenance allowance for me and my wife and children.
Everything should be very ordinary. Garments for summer and
winter will be needed and they are to be returned when worn out
before the demand for new ones are made'."
Abu Bakr bin Hafs ~ states that Abu Bakr ~ said to A.ishah ~
before his death, "I was only benefited from the service done to the
Muslims by eating and wearing whatever rough and coarse clothes
were available. I have nothing of the public funds with me except a
slave, a dromedary and an old sheet. Send all of these to Umar when I
am no more."
Hasan bin Ali ~ relates that on the eve of his death, Abu Bakr ~
said to Aishah Siddiqah ~ , "After my death you will send to Umar

272

History of Islam

this she-camel whose milk we drank, this big bowl I ate from and
these sheets. I had taken these articles from the Bait-ul-Mal (public
funds) in my capacity as the caliph." When these things reached Umar
~ he remarked, "May Allah show mercy on Abu Bakr, how terribly
he suffered for us." Abu Bakr ~ never kept wealth and goods
deposited with the Bait-ul-Mal. He spent on the Muslims whatever
came to the public treasury. At times he purchased horses and
weapons to be given in the way of Allah and sometimes he bought
clothes for the poor and the bedouins. When Umar ~, along with
some Companions, examined th'e Bait-ul-Mal after Abu Bakr's death,
it was empty. The little girls of the" locality would come to him with
their goat to be milked and he would do it for them. Abu Bakr Siddiq
~ used to sit among people in a manner that nobody could recognize
who was the caliph.

Important Events of the Siddiqi Caliphate
Hall of Banu Sa 1 idah and the Pledge of Caliphate
When Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ came to know ?f the congregation of the
Ansar in the Hall of Banu Sa'idah to choose an Amir (Chief) from the
Ansar, he hurried to the spot accompanied by Umar ~ - It was a
crucial moment in Islamic history. A little delay or neglect might have
disrupted the unity between the Muhajirin and the Ansar causing the
Muslims immense harm. But since Allah the Almighty had decided
otherwise, He infused in Abu Bakr~ the courage and determination
necessary to face the troubled situation and by his wisdom the
situation was resolved. The Prophet of Allah ~ had unified the
Muslims in a manner that the idols of tribal and national arrogance
and discrimination had been broken to pieces. Abu Bakr~ saved the
situation and stopped the trouble in its beginning.
Although the number of the Muhajirin in Al-Madinah was less than
the Ansar, the Ansar were divided in two large sections, the Aus and
the Khazraj, who had been rivals from the pre-Islamic days. Thus the
Muslims of Al-Madinah could possibly be. divided along their old
tribal lines into three large sections, the third being the Muhajirin or
the people of Quraish.
I
I

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

273

Bdi'dh (Pledge)
Shortly after the demise of the Prophet ~' all the Muhajirin assembled
in the Prophet's Mosque because the majority of the Muhajirin lived in
the vicinity of the Mosque while the Ansar were much less in number.
Another Muslim gathering in Saqifah Banu Sa'idah consisted of the
Ansar and a Muhajir or two. With Islam still in its beginning, its
growth, the hostile endeavors of its opponents, turbulence and
turmoil created by battles and expeditions, the extermination of
polytheism and the Muslims bowing their will before the Islamic
codes made it tremendously important for the Muslims as a whole to
choose for themselves an Amir without any delay.
The loving sentiments of Umar ~ gave the people no opportunity to
think over the issue of the caliphate. Had Abu Bakr ~ not hurried to
the spot ori hearing the terrible news of the Prophet's demise, nobody
can say how long the people i11 the Prophet's Mosque would have been
in the grip of that distressing situation. The congregation held at the
sitting place of Sa'd bin Ubadah ~ was· different. They were
comparatively peaceful and were seriously deliberating the issue of
choosing a successor of the Prophet ;i in temporal affairs. This
congregation belonged to the Ansar and was held at the place of Sa'd
bin Ubadah ~ who was the chief of the Khazraj. This section of the
Ansar were superior to the Aus in number and wealth, it was only
natural that the majority of them would be in favor of the Khazraj chief.
Although the Muhajirin numbered less in Al-Madinah, they were so
influential and in command of the affairs that an Ansari got up to say
how could the Muhajirin be forced to accept a caliph from the Ansar.
Another Ansari rose to suggest that a caliph from Muhajirin and
another from the Ansar was the best and the most reasonable solution.
"But it will be a show of weakness on our part," Sa'd bin Ubadah ~
said objecting to the dual system. In response to this plea, an Ansar
rose to say, "In case they reject our caliph, we shall drive them out
from Al-Madinah at the point of our swords." However, the few
Muhajirin in the assembly protested against this attitude and this led
to a dispute and disorder of a serious nature and a fight between the
Mulzajirin and the Ansar seemed possible.

274

History of Islam

When the situation took this ugly turn, Mughirah bin Shu'bah ~ left
the trouble spot and came to the Prophet's Mosque to relate what was
going on in Saqifah Banu Sa'idah. The situation on this side was that
Abu Bakr ~ had just finished his speech and was now engaged in
making arrangements for the burial. But on hearing this awful news
he left everything to go to the Ansar and bring the situation under
control.
He took with him Umar and Abu Ubaidah ~ and left Ali~ and
others to make arrangements for the burial of the Prophet ~ . In a
situation packed with confusion, disorder, anger and emotion only a
man like Abu Bakr ~ could do what was necessary. When Umar ~
made an attempt to say something, Abu Bakr ~ put a check on him
for he knew that an emotionally charged Umar ~ could mishandle
the already deteriorating situation.
Abu Bakr ~ himself rose to speak and said in a tone fiJled with
confidence and firmness, "The first among the chiefs will be from the
Muhajirin, and the Ansar will be their advisors." Thereupon Hubab
bin Al-Mundhir ~ said, "It seems reasonable that there should be
one Amir (chief) from us and another from you." Umar ~ replied,
"You remember very well that the Prophet ~ had exhorted the
Muhajirin to take care of the Ansar and did not ask the Ansar to make
concessions to the Muhajirin. This will of the Prophet ~ goes in favor
of the Muhajirin to be at the helm of affairs."
Hubab bin Al-Mundhir ~ tried to answer back but Abu Ubaidah ~
pacified both of them. Meanwhile Bashir bin An-Numan bin Ka'b
Ansari ~ got up and expressed his feeling, "The Prophet ~ most
certainly belonged to the Quraish tribe so the people of the Quraish
alone deserve the caliphate. We, no doubt, lent our help and support
to Islam, but our efforts were meant solely for seeking the Pleasure of
Allah, and we don't want its compensation in this world nor do we
want to pick a quarrel with he Muhajirin."
Following this, Hubab bin Al-Mundhir • said, "You have showed
utmost timidity and undid our position as a whole." Bashir ~
replied, "I have not showed any timidity and I have preferred not to

you not heard O Hubab that the Prophet of Allah ~ had said, 'Imams
will come from the Quraish.'?" These utterances of Bashir ~ received
support from some other Ansfir too. Hubab bin Al-Mundhir ~ also
kept silent and changed his opinion. In this way the religious and
spiritual considerations prevailed over the material and temporal
ones.
Now the entire congregation plunged in deep silence and the growing
conflict between the Muhlijirin and the Ansiir over the issue of the
caliphate disappeared. In this state of perfect peace, Abu Bakr Siddiq
=Ji-· said, "Umar and Abu Ubaydah are here, choose anyone of them."
Umar ..;~ said, "No, Abu Bakr is the most excellent among the
Mulziijiri11. He has been the Companion of the Prophet * in the cave;
the Prophet :it asked him to officiate in leading the Muslims in
prayers, and prayer is the most superior of all other Articles of Faith.
Therefore, none is entitled to assume the duties bf the caliphate in the
presence of Abu Bakr." Saying this Umar ~ stretched his hand first
of all to take Bai'ah (oath of allegiance) at the hand of Abu Bakr Siddiq
Jj~ followed by Abu Ubaidah and Bashir bin Sa'd Ansari ~ - After
that the people on all sides of Abu Bakr ,t.~ came to take Bai'ah. As the
news spread, all the believers rushed to pledge their allegiance to the
caliph.
Sa'd bin Ubadah ~ from the Anslir and those from the M11hlijirin who
were engaged in making arrangements for the burial, did not take the
Bai'ah in Saqifoh Banu Sa'idah. However, Sa'd ~ took the Bai'ah with
Abu Bakr
later the same day. Ali, Zubair and Talhah ::..~ didn't take
Bai'alz for 40 days or according to some narratives for six months with
the complaint that they were not included in the consultations that
were held at Saqifah Banu Sa'idah concerning the Bai'alz.
One day Ali .;~ came to Abu Bakr .;~ and said, "I don't refuse to
admit that your virtues entitle you to the caliphate. My sole complaint
is that we are the close relatives of the Prophet * ' why did you then
take Bai'ah at Saqifah Banu Sa'idah without consulting us. Had you
called us there, we would have taken Bai'ah at your hand ahead of
everyone." Abu Bakr ~ said in reply, "To treat the relatives of the
Prophet ~ well is dearer and more desirable to me than to do so for
my own relatives. I went to Saqifah Banu Sa'idah not for the taking of

276

History of Islam

Bai'ah but for· putting an end to the dispute arising between the
Muhajirin and the Ansar, which had caused a difficult situation. I did
not seek their support, they rather took their oath of allegiance to me
on their own and demonstrated their complete unanimity in this
matter. Had I delayed the matter, it would have posed a greater
danger to the unity, integrity and solidarity of Islam. How could J
send for you when there was no time." Ali~ listened to what Abu
Bakr Siddiq ~ said with rapt attention and withdrew his complaint
gracefully. The next day he pronounced his allegiance to Abu Bakr ~
before a large congregation in the Prophet's Mosque.

Address of Abu Bakr ~
After the meeting at Saqifah Banu Sa'idah and being absolved from
his duty of the burial of the Prophet ~, Abu Bakr~ took the oath of
allegiance from the general population and then rose to deliver his
address. After praising and glorifying Allah, he said to the people:
"I have been chosen as your chief although I am better than
none of you. Thus, if I do good work it is incumbent on you to
extend your help and support to me; if I go wrong it is your
duty to put me on the right path. Truth and righteousness are a
trust and untruth is a breach of trust. The weak among you are
strong to me unless I give them full justice, and the strong
among you are weak to me unless I receive what is due from
them. Abandon not Jihad, when the people hold back from
Jihad, they are put to disgrace. Obey me while I keep obeying
Allah and His Messenger ~; renounce me when I disobey Allah
and His Messenger ~ ' for obedience to me is not incumbent on
you then."
That was the day when thirty-three thousand Companions pledged
their allegiance to Abu Bakr ~- The dispute between the Muhajirin and
the Ansar was solved leaving no hard feelings behind. It was because
the Companions of the Prophet ~ had thoroughly learned to prefer
Faith to temporal affairs and due to this quality no other segment of
humanity ever attained the level of development that the Companions
of the Prophet ~ had gracefully reached.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

Usamah's Army marches on
The people of Yemen and Najd had come into the fold of Islam just a
few months before the death of the Prophet~ and Islam had not yet
entered their hearts perfectly bringing about the complete
transformation of their thoughts and actions. This resulted in men like
Aswad and 1\1.usailamah raising their heads to claim prophethood and
leading a section of new Muslims astray in each territory. The final
departure of the Messenger of Allah ~ came as a golden opportunity
for them to cash in on the prevailing shock and feeling of
disappointment among the Muslims at large.
Every age produces some mischiefmongers of an evil nature and they
try to take advantage of these type of situations. Thus some people
and tribes having an extreme lust for power and fame, raised their
heads and set about devising ways and means to capture power and
bring the Muslims under their direct influence. As a result of the
winds of apostasy and hypocrisy blowing here and there, the pure
and sincere Muslims felt shocked and deeply disturbed. Had they not
been brought up by the Prophet~ and his sacred company to instill
courage, determination and firmness, the binding force of Islam
would have been miserably disintegrated.
Almost every where in the Arabian continent except Al-Madinah,
Makkah and Ta'if, the flames of apostasy were fiercely raging
threatening to burn down the citadel of Islam. Still more disturbing
were the reports that forces inimical to Islam had once again mustered
courage to invade Al-Madinah, and preparations were on to
implement their long standing and wicked plans. The Prophet ~ had
already dispatched an expedition headed by Usamah bin Zaid ~ to
take on the Romans in Syria, which had halted its movement due to
the serious illness of the Prophet ~ Now when Abu Bakr~ wanted to send the same expedition after the
death of the Prophet ~ ' the Companions put forward their suggestion
to the Caliph that in the wake of the clouds of apostasy gathering on
all sides, the expedition should be held back for sometime. It shows
the fathomless depth of courage, grit, determination and power of

278

History of Islam

Faith wielded by Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ when he answered them, "If I
was convinced that a beast would tear me apart after the dispatch of
the army, I would not hold back at any cost what the Prophet~ had
ordered to go ahead."
In response to the call of the Caliph, the Companions already enlisted
collected in the military camp outside Al-Madinah. Although they
joined the army of Usamah ~ a section still had some reservations
about it for two reasons. One, Usamah ~ was the son of a slave and
he was only 17 years old, and therefore, too young and inexperienced
to lead an army of distinguished Companions. Before moving ahead
Usamah sent Umar ~ as a soldier of his army to Al-Madinah with
the message that the eminent Companions should be called back as
the headquarters of Islam was under the threat of an enemy attack.
The Ansar also sent a message to the Caliph through Umar ~ that an
elderly person of noble stock be appointed as the commander of the
Muslim troops. Responding to the message of Usamah ~, the Caliph
said, "Had the departure of Muslim troops rendered the city of AlMadinah vacant and I would be left alone to be taken away by beasts
of prey, the march of the army would not be put off." As to the
message of the Ansar, Abu Bakr ~ said "They still carry the
impression of arrogance and snobbery in their hea rts." Following this
he got up and left on foot for the military camp outside Al-Madinah
to personally see off Usamah ~ and his army. Usamah ~ moved
ahead and Abu Bakr ~ walked along with the mount of the
commander talking and discussing matters of importance. Usamah
~ said to the Caliph, "Either you mount the animal or allow me to
get down to accompany you on foot." The Caliph replied, "I shall not
ride nor do you need to get down. What harm shall I be inflicted with
if I accompany you over some distance in the way of Allah." This act
of Abu Bakr ~ was the practical answer to the Ansar who had some
misgivings regarding the command of Usamah ~-

Exhortations to Usamah ~:
Walking along with the mount of Usamah ~ , the Chief of the
believers instructed Usamah ~ about a ten-point doctrine, which he
should follow strictly during the battle and they are as follows:

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

279

1) Do not approach embezzlement. (2) Do not tell a lie. (3) Do not
commit a breach of trust. (4) Do not kill children, women or the aged.
(5) Do not cut down trees with fruit. (6) Slaughter not camels, cows or
goats for any purpose other than eating. (7) Call to Islam the people
you find. (8) Pay due respect to anyone you meet. (9) Start eating in
the Name of Allah when the meal is served to you. (10) Fight not with
those among the Jews and the Christians who have taken refuge in
their places of worship. And finally, neither add to what the
Messenger of Allah ~ has ordered you to do nor subtract from it.
Fight the disbelievers with the Name of Allah and in His way.
Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ went along with Usamah ~ up to Jurf and then
came back. Before taking leave, he said to Usamah ~, "If you grant
permission I want Umar to be in Al-Madinah to assist and give me
advice." Usamah ~ promptly permitted Umar ~ to return back to
Al-Madinah.
It is significant and exemplary that the Caliph took permission from

the military commander to keep Umar ~ with him although he was
totally within his rights to order this on his own.

Success achieved by Usamah

•=

Usamah ~ reached the valleys of Jardon and Balqa' and defeated the
Roman army. He returned after forty days with an immense amount
of spoils of war and prisoners. Even as the departure of the Muslim
army was in an atmosphere charged with disorder, disruption and
misdirected emotion, and to invade and punish the formidable
Romans looked unreasonable and risky to the extreme, the fruits of
this adventure were justly wholesome and sweet. It sent terror into
the hearts of the apostates and the opponents of Islam and convinced
them to the core that the absence of the Prophet ;i did not diminish
the Muslim's invincible determination and courage and love for
Islam. As a result, the claimants of prophethood like Tulaihah Asadi
and Musailamah the liar could not muster enough courage to step
forth from their own territories. Those who had refused to pay Zakat
meekly surrendered to the will of Islam. Moreover, the substantial
quantity of spoils of war played a significant role in strengthening the
Islamic army and improving the economic condition of the believers.

280

History of Islam

Trial of Apostasy
To assume that the death of the Prophet ~ sent Arabia except AlMadinah, Makkah and Ta'if into the fold of apostasy is not the truth.
They had not shifted from Tauhid to Shirk (polytheism) all of a sudden
and took to idol worship. The fact is that even the false claimants to
prophethood were not against Sa/cit (prayer). They were, however,
particularly against the payment of Zakdt for it went against their
sense of freedom and dignity, and these new Muslims were ahead of
others in rejecting what they claimed as an 'undignified' demand of
Islam. Since they could be easily aroused against this most important
pillar of Islam, men like Musailamah and Tulaihah used it as a tool to
fulfil their evil plans.
In short, the issue before the Muslims was not polytheism and idol
worship; what was threatening and injurious was the question of
unity and solidarity of the system Islam had established at the cost of
many sacrifices. The rejection of the demand of Zakat was even more
dangerous to the cause of Islam than the battles fought by the
Muslims against the external forces inimical to fslam. The Chief of the
believers, Abu Bakr ~ held an emergency meeting of the
Companions on this explosive issue. But they put forward their
opinion against fighting with the tejecters of Zakat, just as they were
not in favor of Usamah ~ leading an army against the Romans. But
on this occasion too, the inimitable courage and determination of Abu
Bakr ~ prevailed over all kinds of anxieties and misgivings. He
announced with indomitable spirit and firmness that he would go and
fight against any tribe who refused to pay even one animal or one
rope that was due.
In the meantime the deputations of the apostates came to Al-Madinah
and said, "We perform prayer but we want an exemption from Zakat."
But this hard-hitting reply made them silently go back to their
respective places. In the wake of the hard line adopted by Abu Bakr
Siddiq ~, they rose as one man against the Islamic State. The
prevailing confusion and threat to the unity and integrity of Islam
needed a leader of outstanding courage and determination . Abu Bakr
~ was fit to face this disorderly situation and the unruly people who

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

281

were making preparations to invade Al-Madinah, in the absence of
Muslim troops, who were fighting the Romans far away from their
center.
However, even in the face of such a trying situation, the Caliph of
Islam was not ready to give any concession concerning his decision
and would not compromise with the forces seeking to break the basic
tenets of Islam. He was in full control of the situation both internally
and externally. He kept himself in close contact with the Muslim
forces fighting in the far off lands and issued the necessary orders to
the collectors of Zakdt . He encouraged the people of Al-Madinah to
keep firm and unified and he made the preparations necessary to deal
with the opportunistic alliances of those who had vested interests.
He asked the fighters among the people of Al-Madinah to keep alert
and be on guard in front of the Prophet's Mosque, while Ali, Zubair,
Talhah and Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~~ were sent on patrol duty around
AI-Madinah. Information reached the headquarters that the people of
Abs, Dhubyan, Banu Kinanah and Banu Asad tribes had collected to
attack the Muslims. Their march towards Al-Madinah was checked by
the patrols, which also sent news to Al-Madinah about the enemy
movement. Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ himself went to repulse the enemy
attack up to Dhu Khushub. However, when Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ went
again for an encounter, they used drums and other instruments that
caused the camels of the Muslims to get scared and they fled back to
AI-Madinah. Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ organized them and made a fierce
charge on the enemy and routed them completely killing many of
them after a fight of five or six hours.

Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ sent the spoils of war to Al-Madinah under the
charge of Nu 'man bin Muqrin ~ and a small party, and himself went
to Dhul-Qassah in hot pursuit of the enemy. Meanwhile the enemy
invaded some tribes in the back area and martyred many Muslims
there. When Abu Bakr ~ came to know of the incident on his return,
he vowed to kill as many apostates equal to the number of Muslims
who were martyred at their hands. He was on the verge of lea ving AlMadinah when Usamah ~ entered Al-Madinah with booty in large
quantity. Because the detachment was terribly exhausted, he left it in
I Al-Madinah to take rest and guard it against any fresh attack. And he

History of Islam

282

himself left Al-Madinah at the head of a small detachment and went
up to Dhu Khushub and Dhul-Qassah raiding their centers and
routing who ever faced them. After finishing his task, he stayed at
Abraq for a couple of days before his departure to AI-Madinah.

Edict of Abu Bakr Siddiq ~:
Immediately after his return to Al-Madinah, Abu Bakr ~ penned an
edict and sent copies to the apostate tribes through his messengers to
be read out in public gatherings. The contents of the edict were as
follows:
From Abu Bakr, the Caliph of the Messenger of Allah~' to
each and every person whether he has accepted Islam or not.
Let it be known to one and all that Allah the Almighty sent
Muhammad ~ as a true Prophet who sought to give glad
tidings and to warn and to call to Allah by His Order, he is the
illuminated lamp of guidance. Allah the Almighty guides one
to the right path who accepts the invitation of Islam, but
anyone who rejects it is made to show obedience through
struggle and fighting. The Prophet of Allah ~ made his final
departure after accomplishing his task of calling people
towards Islam and the straight path of Allah. And Allah the
Almighty has already acquainted all with this in the Qur'an:
"Verily, you will die and they will also die." (39:30)
"And We granted not to any human being immortality before
you, the. you die, would they live forever?" (21:34)
"Muhammad is no more than a Messenger and indeed
Messengers have passed away before him. Thus, if he is dead
or killed, will you turn back? If anyone turns back, he will do
no harm to Allah the Almighty. Allah the Almighty will give
good reward to those who give thanks." (3:144)
Thus, one who worshipped Muhammad~ then Muhammad ~
is now dead and gone, but one who worshipped Allah Alone
then Allah is living and He has not died; He is neither
overpowered by sleep nor touched by drowsiness. He looks

I
j The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

283

after His Own Orders and will at anytime take revenge on His
enemies. I exhort you all to fear Allah, to share what the
Prophet ~ brought in the form of light and guidance from
Allah, to follow the guidance of Allah and to hold firmly to the
rope of the religion of Allah. Anyone who is not guided by
Allah the Almighty, goes astray; he is helpless and alone who is
deprived of the support of Allah. No deed of a man is
acceptable in this world and the Hereafter while he rejects
Islam. I have come to know that some of you have turned to
follow Satan and acts of ignorance forsaking Allah the
Almighty. Allah the Almighty says that Satan is your sworn
enemy, so be hostile to Satan, for he seeks to make his followers
dwellers of Hell-fire. I have decided to send the detachment
made up of the Muhajirin and the Ansar to you, they follow
virtue. I have instructed them not to fight anybody without
calling them to Islam and to lend support to those who accept
Islam, to keep from evil and reject not the good, and to fight
those who reject Islam. It is good for the one who accepts Islam. I
have ordered my emissary to read out this message at a large
gathering. When a Muslim d etachment draws near and its caller
calls. the Adhan, you too respond to it by calling the Adhtin, this
symbolizes your acceptance of Islam and thus spares your life. If
you fail to call the Adhan, you will invite the Muslims to attack

Uprooting the Apostates:
As a follow-up action, after the dispatch of emissaries with the
circulars, Abu Bakr ~ made eleven banners. Each to be given to
eleven heads who were chosen to lead separate detachments with the
instructions that they should take some men from Makkah, Ta' if and
other places, and leave the rest to look after the home front. The first
of the flags was handed over to Khalid bin Walid ~ with the order to
launch his first attack at Tulaihah bin Khuwailid Asadi and to make
Malik bin Nuwairah his next target at Butah. Another standard was
given to Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl to make an attack on Musailamah the
liar at Yamamah. Shurahbil bin Hasanah ~ was given the third
banner to first assist lkrimah ~ and then go to Hadramout to invade

284

History of Islam

Banu Kindah and Banu Quda'ah. The fourth one was entrusted to
Khalid bin Saeed bin Al-As~ to go to Syria and put down uprisings
with a firm hand. Fifth standard was given to Amr bin Al-As ~ for
Banu Quda'ah. Hudhaifah bin Mihsan ~ was sent to the people of
Oman, and Arfajah bin Harthamah ~ to Mahrah with the seventh
one. The eighth one was given to Tarqah bin Ha.jib~ to go to Banu
Sulaim and Banu Hawa zin. Suwaid bin Muqarrin ~ was ordered to
go to Yemen (Tihamah) with the ninth one. Ala' bin Hadrami ~ with
the tenth standard was sent to Bahrain. Muhajir bin Abu Umayyah
was sent to San'a' with the eleventh. All these heads were given a
circular with the same content, which is given here:

The Manifesto of Abu Bakr Siddiq ~:
This is a covenant from Abu Bakr, the Caliph of the Messenger
of Allah ~' which is handed over to so-and-so, the head of the
detachment on the eve of his departure to fight the apostates.
From the commander of the detachment I have obtained his
undertaking to fear Allah the Almighty in all affairs of life
inwardly and outwardly. I have ordered him to make them see
reason before falling on the apostates and to stop fighting if and
when they accept Islam and then make them learn their rights
and duties and their rights be given and the duties due on them
be taken without showing concessions whatsoever. Whoever
keeps any other kind of belief after the confessing of Islam is
left to Allah to be accountable to Him. But those who will carry
the matter to the point of fighting by rejecting Islam outright, if
overpowered or d efeated by the believers, their spoils are to be
distributed among the Muslims after taking out the fifth part
therefrom. I have also issued orders to the commanders to stop
their troops from creating disturbances and takin g hasty actions
resulting in chaos and havoc and from admitting strangers to
their detachment without their knowing perfectly their identity.
I have also written them to treat the Muslims politely and show
mercy to the people while camping at and decamping a place.
All these detachments left AI-Madinah in the month of Jumada AlUkhra 11 AH, for the territories assigned to them.

Tulaihali Asadi
Tulaihah was a soothsayer who entered Islam but claimed for himself
prophethood during the last days of the Messenger of Allah~- Some
tribes of Children of Israel joined his party. Dirar bin Al-Azwar ~
was sent to punish him but the task was not completed because he
hurried back to Al-Madinah on hearing the sad news of the demise of
the Prophet ~- During that period, Tulaihah Asadi had an
opportunity to rebuild his position. The people of Ghatfan and
Hawazin tribes who had already been routed by Abu Bakr ~
collected themselves once again to join the bandwagon of Tulaihah's
party. He pitched his camp at Buzakhah, the well-known stream of
Najd, and the people of Ghatfan, Hawazin, Banu Asad, Banu Amir
and Banu Tai gathered around him to make it a massive force.
Khalid bin Walid ~ launched an attack on Tulaihah's troops at
Buzakhah, which was fighting under the command of Tulaihah's
brother Khayyal. Tulaihah himself was sitting farther from his troops
in a mantle pretending to be waiting for a 'revelation'. The battle
became intense.
When the apostates' troops began to suffer reverses, Uyainah bin Hisn
came to Tulaihah and asked him if any revelation was sent down to
him. "Not yet," Tulaihah replied. After a while he came again,
repeated the same question, and received the same reply. Now the
Muslim detachment was clearly dominating the battle scene and the
apostates were getting routed. When Uyainah came to Tulaihah and
put the same question to him for the third time, he replied rather
cunningly, "Jibril has come to me to say that things will happen
according to what is in store for us." Uyainah got enraged at this
artful reply and exclaimed, "O people! Tulaihah is a liar, so I am
leaving now." Having heard this, the apostates took to their heels
leaving behind a great number of dead and many were captured. A
large number of people returned to Islam on the spot.
Tulaihah, along with his wife fled on horseback and took refuge with
the Quda'ah tribe. When all the other tribes, including his own, came
back to the fold of Islam, Tulaihah also confessed Islam and came to

286

History of Islam

Al-Madinah during the caliphate of Umar ~- Uyainah was brought
before Khalid bin Walid ~ as a captive and was sent to Al-Madinah.
Here he accepted Islam in state of humiliation but afterward he made
himself sincere to it.
The fugitives from the army of Tulaihah, made up of the Ghatfan,
Sulaim and Hawazin tribes, collected at Haw ab and chose Salrna bint
Malik bin Hudhaifah bin Badr bin Zafar as their chief. Following this
they made large-scale preparations against the Muslims. Informed of
this, Khalid bin Walid ~ moved to meet the lurking threat. Salma
was herself heading the army. Khalid bin Walid ~ attacked the
enemy which resulted in fierce fighting between the two forces. About
one hundred apostates were killed safeguarding her dromedary. At
last she fell down from the injured she-camel and was instantly killed.
Her followers immediately disappeared from the battleground.
About the same time a chieftain of Banu Sulaim, Al-Fajah bin Abd
Yalil called on Abu Bakr Siddiq~ and said to him, "I am a Muslim.
Please help me with weapons so that I can go and fight against the
apostates." Abu Bakr ~ granted his request. When he left AlMadinah, he pronounced his apostasy and sniped at the sections of
Banu Hawazin and Banu Sulairn who had confessed Islam. After
being informed of this treachery, Abu Bakr ~ sent Abdullah bin Qais
~ with a small party who caught the culprit, who was trying to
escape, and brought him to Al-Madinah where he was killed.

Sajah and Malik bin Nuwairah
Banu Tamim inhabited a few settlements where, during the lifetime of
the Prophet ~ ' Malik bin Nuwairah, Waki ' bin Malik, Safwan bin
Safwan, Qais bin Asim were working as collectors of Zakat and other
charities. Now as the news of the Prophet's demise spread, Qais bin
Asim turned apostate while Malik bin Nuwairah expressed his joy.
However, Safwan bin Safwan ~ remained firm as a Muslim.
In the meantime Sajah bint Al-Harith bin Suwaid of the Taghlib tribe
declared her prophethood . Hudhail bin lmran-the chief of Banu
Taghlib, Uqbah bin Hilal-the chief of Banu Namir and Salil bin Qaisthc chief of Banu Shaiban accepted her claim. She was able to collect

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

287

about four thousand soldiers around her and she moved ahead to
invade Al-Madinah. She came to know that Khalid bin Walid ~ was
also on the move from the opposite direction. This news was quite
disturbing for her. Moreover Sajah and Musailamah were afraid of
each other, as both of them had claimed prophethood. Their anxiety
multiplied when they came to know that both Ikrimah and Shurahbil
had reached Yamamah with Muslim detachments. Thus both of
I them were practicing caution.

~
I

At last, Musailamah wrote a letter to Sajah to find out her intentions.

IShe wrote back, "I wanted to invade Al-Madinah. Since both of us are
prophets, let us launch a joint attack." Musailamah very haughtily
replied, "While the Prophet Muhammad was alive, I had surrendered
Ihalf of my country in his favor; after him I am the sole ruler of the
j country. However, since you too claim prophethood, I shall confer
j half of my prophethood on you. It is better that you come to me alone
' leaving your troops behind so that we can sit together in consultations
concerning the division of the prophethood and the invasion of AlMadinah."

I

IMarriage of the Liar-prophetess:
Immediately after receiving the message of Musailamah she left to
meet him. He welcomed her in a camp specially erected in front of his
fortress . They held secret talks, which resulted in Sajah accepting his
prophethood and giving herself to him in marriage. She stayed with
Musailamah for three days and then came back to her camp. The
army asked about the bride price. She sent this request back to
Musailamah and he exempted them from the dawn and night prayers
as her bride price. As she moved ahead she came across the Muslim
army led by Khalid bin Walid ~ - The soldiers of Sajah became so
terrified that they fled to far off places leaving Sajah alone and she
could barely save herself. She joined her tribe and passed the rest of
her life in obscurity.

Assassination of Malik bin Nuwairah:
It has already been mentioned that Malik bin Nuwairah expressed joy
over the death of the Prophet :i. He had also made peace with Sajah

288

History of Islam

but had later on severed his relation with her. When he was captured
and brought before Khalid bin Walid ,tk,, the Muslims argued that the
people of the settlement of Malik bin Nuwairah had responded with
Adhan and so he should not be killed. Others discounted this point
since the Adhan was not called as a response and he should be killed as
per the order of the caliph of the Prophet of Allah :'i;. The investigation
of Khalid bin Walid ,tk, could not bring the matter to light. But during
his talk with Khalid ,tk, he referred to the Prophet~ more than once as:
"Your chief has said such and such." Being enraged at such a<llanner
of address, Khalid ,tk, said, "Was he not your chief?" But Malik bin
Nuwairah did not make a satisfactory reply.
According to Tabari, Dirar bin Al-Azwar ~' who was then standing
near by with his sword in hand, cut the head of Malik off after taking
a sign from Khalid ~. Such are the things that happen on the
battlefield. But historians mention it for other reasons. Abu Qatadah
~ was also in the detachment of Khalid bin Walid ,tk, and was in
support of the section which argued that Adlu'in was called in the
settlement of Malik bin Nuwairah. Because of this he grew angry at
the killing of Malik and returned to Al-Madinah without taking
permission from Khalid bin Walid ,tk,, the commander of the Muslim
detachment. He lodged a complaint with the Caliph that Khalid bin
Walid kills the Muslims without valid reasons. Umar ~ and others
advised the Caliph to first depose Khalid ~ and then take retaliatory
action against him. It was easy to accuse him of killing a Muslim
because he (Khalid ~) had later married the wife of Malik bin
Nuwairah.
After a patient hearing of all the details, Abu Bakr ,tk, found Abu
Qatadah ~ guilty of disobeying his commander and leaving the
detachment without his permission. He was then ordered to go back
and join Khalid ,tk, and carry out his orders and he did so accordingly.
Abu Bakr ~ then informed Umar ,tk, and the others that Khalid ~
had merely committed a mistake in judgment. According to the
principles of war and the military system, Khalid-the Sword among
the Swords of Allah, could neither be brought to pay Qisas
(retaliation) nor deposed. Abu Bakr Siddiq ,tk, then paid the blood
money from the public treasury.

Musailamah the Liar
Banu Hanifah was one of the tribes, which appeared in the form of a
deputation before the Prophet ~ after the conquest of Makkah.
Musailamah bin Hubaib belonged to this same tribe. On his return to
Yamamah from Al-Madinah, he heard about the illness of the Prophet
~ and declared his prophethood. He also sent a letter to the Prophet
~ saying, "Since prophethood is being shared by both of us, each one
is entitled to possess half of the country." The Prophet~ wrote back:
"In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. From
Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah to Musailamah the liar. Peace be
upon whom who follows the guidance. After that, the earth is Allah's.
He gives it as a heritage to whom He wills of His slaves and the end is
for the pious."
Following this letter, the Prophet ~ sent Rajjal bin Anfuh, a
respectable man of Banu Hanifah to bring Musailamah back to the
path of guidance.
Rajjal reached Yamamah and then lent support to Musailamah
instead, and became his follower. His notorious mission gained wide
popularity. At last, Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl. was sent to punish him
and then Shurhabil bin Hasanah •
was dispatched with
reinforcements. Ikrimah • invaded Musailamah' s army before the
arrival of the reinforcements and was defeated. Having heard this
news, Abu Bakr • sent word to Ikrimah • not to return to AlMadinah but to join Hudhaifah and Arfajah ~ and fight with the
people of Mahrah and Oman under their command. Having finished
that campaign he had to leave for Yemen and Hadramout along with
his detachment to join Muhajir bin Abu Umayyah • . He wrote to
Shurhabil bin Hasanah • to go towards the territories of Khalid bin
Walid ~; and leave for Quda'ah and fight along with the people
under the command of Amr bin Al-As~ and punish the apostates
there. In the meantime, Khalid bin Walid • came back to AlMadinah. Abu Bakr • instead of calling him to account, sent him to
punish Musailamah the liar at the head of a detachment including
both the Muhiijirin and the Ansiir, which actually was a sign of respect
to him.

History of Islam

Deviation to Nationality:
Musailamah had with him forty thousand warriors of the Rabi'ah
tribe. Some of them knew him as a liar but their misdirected sense of
national pride led them to wish him success. They would openly say,
"Musailamah is a liar while Muhammad is truthful. However, to all of
us, the liar-prophet of Rabi'ah is dearer than the truthful Prophet of
Banu Mudar." After sending Khalid bin Walid ~, the Caliph Abu
Bakr Siddiq ~ dispatched a few more columns to strengthen the
army of Khalid ~ who joined him on the way. Now the strength of
the Muslim army under the command of Khalid ~ rose to thirteen
thousand. When he was at a distance of one day from the city of
Yamamah, he sent a small column as an advance guard.
The same day Musailamah had dispatched Mujja'ah bin Mura.rah at
the head of sixty men to snipe at Banu Tamim. Thus this party came
across the advance guard of the Muslim army. In the encounter, all
the apostates were killed and their head Mujja'ah was brought before
Khalid~- When Khalid~ reached Yamamah, Musailamah came out
of the city and encamped in a fortified garden at the gate of the city.

Furious Fight:
The forty thousand strong army of Musailamah the liar attacked the
Muslim troops not exceeding thirteen thousand in number. A very
furious and dreadful fight broke out. The Muslim fighters sustained
the fierce attack of the enemy with exemplary patience and firmness .
Soon after they collected themselves at the center and fell on the
enemy like hungry tigers and routed them thoroughly. The apostates
fled the field but collected at the gate of the garden and showed some
courage and firmness. At this stage Thabit bin Qais ~, the standard
bearer of the Muslim army was honored with martyrdom. Zaid bin
Khattab ~ lifted the standard and the Muslims showed such valor
and virility that the enemy had to retreat behind the walls of the
garden but the Muslims broke into it.
Now the people asked Musailamah, "When will the promise of victory
be fulfilled that your god has given to you?" He replied, "This is not

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

291

the time to talk all this; everyone is now required to fight for the safety
of his wife and children." When his garden too turned into the
battleground, Musailamah got on his horse and began to call his people
to give battle. However, when he witnessed that the situation was
under the full control of the Muslims, he got down and moved secretly
towards the exit. Wahshi (the one who assassinated Hamzah ~)
happened to be at the gate of the garden aiming at Musailamah, he
threw his lance so forcefully that it cut through his double coat of mail
and cut across his belly. Panic and terror overtook the enemy and in a
short while there was none left to be seen on the battlefield other than
the Muslims. This battle took a heavy toll on the enemy force leaving
seventeen thousand dead while one thousand from the Muslim side
were honored with martyrdom. Among them were a large number of
H11ffdz (those who had committed the entire Qur'an to memory).
The rest of Banu Hanifah fled the battlefield fleeing for their lives
leaving their women and children behind. Since a great number of
Muslims had sustained injuries, Khalid bin Walid ~ decided to
conquer the city of Yamamah the next day. Mujja'ah bin Murarah, the
captive took advantage of this decision. He misled Khalid ~ by
saying that the greater number of men of his tribe were still alive and
they were well-equipped and formidable enough to win by the power
of the sword. He then asked Khalid ~ that if he was freed, he could
go to persuade them not to give battle. Thus both the city and its
citizens would come under their control without blood and toil.
Khalid ~ accepted his proposal and freed him.
Mujja'ah went into the city and asked the women to get on the
ramparts with their weapons. He then came back and said to Khalid
~' "My people are not ready to make peace merely in return for their
safety." When Khalid ~ looked towards the city, he found that the
ramparts showed nothing but swords and spears, which verified the
statement of Mujja'ah. Keeping an eye on his injured soldiers and the
expectation of a long drawn out battle, Khalid ~ thought it
reasonable to make peace with the enemy. Thus he offered to leave for
them half of their wealth and possessions, half of the planted gardens
and half of the captives of Banu Hanifah. Mujja'ah went to the city
once again and came back with the report: "They are not ready to

292

History of Islam

accept this offer, you can win peace by taking from them one-fourth
of their possessions." Khalid ~ agreed to the proposal and the peace
treaty was written down.
Following this, Khalid ~ went inside the city. He, to his utmost
amazement, found there none but women and children. "Why did you
play a trick on me?" Khalid ~ asked Mujja'ah. "My people were
virtually on the brink of death and destruction, so it was my duty to
pull them out of this situation, please excuse me," Mujja'ah replied.
Khalid ~ kept silent not thinking in the least about breaking the
agreement. A short while after Musailamah bin Waqsh, an emissary of
Abu Bakr ~ gave Khalid~ a letter from the Caliph directing him to
kill their men and make their women and children captives in case the
battle was won. But the peace treaty was signed before the arrival of
the emissary, so the order from Al-Madinah could not be implemented.
This event is a memorable example of how particular the Muslims were
about keeping their promises and upholding their treaties.
Khalid bin Walid ~ sent a deputation of Banu Hanifah to Abu Bakr
~ with a letter. He had mentioned in it the details about the recent
victory and Banu Hanifah's re-entry to Islam. Abu Bakr~ held them
in high esteem and bade farewell to them in the same spirit. The battle
of Yamamah took place in Dhul-Hijjah 11 AH.

Hatm bin Dubai 1 ah
It has already been mentioned that Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ had sent Ala'

bin Al-Hadrami ~ to Bahrain at the head of a detachment. Banu
Abdul-Qais and Banu Bakr bin Wa'il along with their branches
inhabited Bahrain. It has also been stated that Jarud bin Al-Mualla ~
had once represented Abdul-Qais tribe to the Prophet :I. The people
of Abdul-Qais tribe renounced Islam when they heard of the ·death of
the Prophet :I with the idea that had he been a Prophet, he would not
have died. Jarud bin Al-Mualla ~ assembled his people and put the
question to them, "Had there been other Prophets before Muhammad
:I?" "Yes, there had been many," they admitted with one voice. "Had
they not passed away after passing their lives like common people?"
he put another question. "They all passed away after passing their
days of life," they admitted. "The Prophet :I also completed his span

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

293

of life and then passed away exactly in the same manner," he said and
called in a loud voice: "I testify that there is no God but Allah and
Muhammad in His slave and Messenger." The hearts of the people of
Abdul-Qais tribe were moved so deeply that they all expressed deep
sorrow for their wrongdoing and returned to the fold of Islam.
Though Abdul-Qais tribe was saved through the timely efforts of
Jarud bin Al-Mualla ,tb, but Banu Bakr bin Wa'il tribe took to
apostasy and made Hatm their chief. He marched ahead with a large
number of men from Banu Bakr and camped between Qatif and Hijr.
He then sent a small party to Abdul-Qais tribe to make them
apostates and to come back. However, Abdul-Qais flatly refused to
turn apostate. Hatm then sent Ma'rur bin Suwaid with a group to
either make them apostate or fight with them. In the meantime Ala'
bin Al-Hadrami ,tb arrived in Bahrain with his detachment. He sent
word to Jarud bin Al-Mualla ,tb to launch an attack on Hatm in the
company of Banu Abdul-Qais.
With the spread of this news, Muslims from the surrounding areas
collected around Ala' bin Al-Hadrami ,tb while the apostates
gathered round Hatm. Ala' bin Al-Hadrami ,tb moved ahead with his
army and camped near the military camp of Hatm. Hatm had dug
trenches around his camp. The fight between the two started but none
of them was crowned with victory even after a long period of one
month. However, Ala' bin al-Hadrami ,tb lost his patience and
launched such a furious attack across the enemy trenches that the
enemy force was filled with wild terror, and with the killing of Hatm
at the hands of Qais bin Asim, the entire enemy front was completely
routed. Gradually all the apostates turned back to Islam.

Laqit bin Malik
It has been mentioned above that Abu Bakr Siddiq ,tb had sent
Hudhaifah bin Mihsan ,tb to Oman and Arfajah bin Harthamah ,tb to
the people of Mahrah with the order that they should keep together.
On hearing the news of the death of the Prophet~, Laqit declared his
prophethood in Oman. The people of Oman and Mahrah turned
apostate and forced out of their territory the collectors of charity
appointed by the Prophet ~- Abu Bakr ,tb had sent a message to

294

History of Islam

Hudhaifah bin Mihsan Himyari ~ to first go to Oman and then leave
for Mahrah after finishing his task. He had also directed lkrimah ~
to join Hudhaifah and Arfajah ~ in Oman. Thus all the three
commanders of the Muslim detachments stayed together in Oman.
On being informed, Laqit collected his fighters and moved ahead to
face the Muslim army. Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl was the head of the
advance guard while Hudhaifah had the command of the right wing
and Arfajah the left one and in the middle of the army were the rich
and influential persons of Oman who had been firm on Islam.
Fighting broke out at the time of the dawn prayer. The Islamic army
was fighting from the low-lying areas while the enemy force was
giving battle from the high ground. At the outset the Muslim troops
suffered reverses but the proverbial patience and firmness of the
believers turned the tables and forced the enemy to retreat. They
turned and ran away leaving behind a thousand dead, four thousa nd
as captive and a large quantity of booty. The Muslim army returned
to Al-Madinah victoriously. Jkrimah ~ left for Mahrah and after a
short period of time, the entire Oman returned firmly to Islam.

Apostasy in Mahrah
Mahrah had some people from Oman and some others from AbdulQais, Azd and Banu Sa'd tribes that inhabited this territory. But they
were divided in two factions after turning apostate, each faction
fighting with the other. In this situation Ikrimah ~ arrived in Mahrah
and one of the factions accepted Islam. The next one, whose head was
Musabbih, rejected the offer and remained adamant in his attitude.
Thereupon Ikrimah ~ attacked the apostates giving them a crushing
defeat and killing their chief. This victory led a large number of
people from all the tribes to join the forces of Islam .

Apostasy in Yemen
Aswad Ansi, referred to before, had claimed prophethood for himself
and created disturbances all over Yemen. But he met his doom during
the lifetime of the Prophet ~. Although Islam had been gaining
ground after the cloud of apostasy cleared, the death of the Prophet ~

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

295

let it stage a comeback. They were now getting strong under the
leadership of two chiefs, Qais bin Makshuh and Amr bin Ma'dikarib.
The Muslims were small in numbers and were brutally tortured by
the Yemenite apostates, with the result they had left the area. Abu
Bakr Siddiq ~ had sent Muhajir bin Abu Umayyah ~ with a
detachment to pass through Makkah and Ta'if and then to go to
Najran taking Muslim fighters from these cities. Qais and Amr had
already received the news of Muhajir's arrival. Amr bin Ma'dikarib
was a well known wrestler whose swordsmanship had won him
admiration throughout the country.
Muhajir ~ saw himself and his army surrounded by a swarm of
enemy forces and this infused in them a sense of courage, fervor and
determination, and they attacked the enemy with full force and vigor.
The chieftains, Qais and Amr were caught after a thorough defeat of
the enemy troops. Qais and Amr were sent to Al-Madinah and both of
them admitted their wrongs and returned to Islam.
Muhajir bin Umayyah ~ reached San'a' and cleared the entire
territory of apostates. It was there that Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl met him.
From there both the commanders made a joint march to punish Banu
Kindah who were busy making large-scale preparations against the
Muslims under the command of Ash'ath bin Qais and their strength
was increasing day by day. Informed of this, Muhajir bin Abu
Umayyah ~ took a fast squad of horsemen from his army and
hurried towards Ash'ath leaving his army under the command of
Ikrimah ~- He attacked the enemy force so suddenly and violently
that they fled in terror. Ash'ath made a quick escape and took refuge
in a fort where he was joined by other apostates. Muhajir bin Abu
Umayyah ~ besieged the fort. In the meantime he was joined by
Ikrimah ~ .
The severity of the siege and the blockade of reinforcements forced
him to lay down his arms. He then appealed to the Muslim
commander to spare the lives of only nine persons including his wife
and children. But Ash'ath forgot to include his own name. Thus all,
exclusive of those nine persons were held captive. Ash'ath was also
among the captives. They were presented before Abu Bakr ~,
Ash'ath expressed regret for his past deeds and accepted Islam on the

296

History of Islam

spot. Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ set free all the captives including Ash'ath
issuing them strong warnings not to repeat their past actions.

Complete Eradication of Apostasy
Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ was able to put down all the uprisings of
apostasy in less than one year. Now the entire Arab Peninsula was
free from the filth of polytheism and apostasy. Not a tinge of malaise
of this nature was to be traced anywhere within the bounds of
Arabian continent. Only a few months before, the sky of Islam looked
cloudy everywhere except Al-Madinah, Makkah and Ta'if, and
swords and spears, lances and arrows seemed to be flying
everywhere. However, in this very short period the situation turned
around completely.
It was unflinching courage and unyielding determination that faced the
hostile storm and stress on all fronts and came out victorious in all
events. Even the legendary grit and valor of Rustam and Isphandiyar
could not come face to face with the hundredth part of what was
shown by Abu Bakr Siddiq ~. And the reason is that the qualities of
head and heart displayed by the Caliph of the Prophet ~ were the
direct result of his upbringing under the blessed shadow of the
Messenger of Allah ~.

The army of Siddiq ~ had no doubt, matchless men of lasting
courage like Khalid, Ikrimah, Shurhabil, and Hudhaifah ,$,, but it was
the dauntless courage of Abu Bakr ~, which kept control over the
state of affairs, organized the campaigns and dispatched the
detachments to far off lands. He never allowed fear, anxiety or
timidity to enter the hearts of the true believers. His strategies of war
had no parallel and Muslim commanders were leading their
detachments and Muslim troops were fighting only according to the
plans chalked out by the Caliph of the Prophet ~ At first consideration it appears that the eleven detachments sent to
various places were instrumental in wiping out apostasy from the face
of Arabia, but in fact, it was simply the clever devices and the expert
opinion of Abu Bakr ~ alone that swept away all the rubbish lying in
the path of Islam. And this gigantic task was accomplished within a

I The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

297

I very short span of a few months. In the discouraging and frustrating

I

situation that he was facing, none else was there to show such a
magnificent farsightedness as he demonstrated. He neither agreed to
hold back the expedition of Usamah bin Zaid ~ planned by the
Prophet ~ himself during his last days nor did he pay heed to Umar's
outbursts nor did he delay the collection of Zakat from the apostates.
Who could then be the true successor of the Prophet ::i in his temporal
affairs?

Rome and Persia
There were two fabulously magnificent and large empires existing at
the time of the advent of the Prophet ~' the Roman and the Persian.
The world was then ruled by these two civilizations. Arabia was
steeped in dismal darkness where the last Prophet~ was raised. It
was through Islam that a new power and a new civilization emerged
and engulfed the glittering civilizations of both Rome and Persia and
left its mark as the only important power.
There was a time when the Persian Empire had in its fold the
Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Indus River,
Kashmir, Tibet, Mount Altai and the Caspian Sea. Alexander the
Great of Greece tore this large and grand empire to pieces. But Persian
culture and civilization were still going strong. About four hundred
years before the advent of the Prophet ::i, Ardsher Babkan laid the
foundation of the Sassanid dynasty and brought under its control the
Persian Gulf, the Euphrates, the Caspian Sea, the Indus, Oxus and the
whole continent of Asia.
The center of Roman power was Rome, the city of Italy, which was
ruled over by Julius Caesar and his heir Augustus. Egypt, Asia Minor
and the whole of Europe formed part of the Roman Empire. It was
later divided into two parts. While Rome remained the capital of the
western part, the eastern part made Constantinople its capital. The
king of Constantinople was also called Caesar and he ruled over
Egypt, Abyssinia, Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor and the Balkans. The
Eastern Roman Rule was far ahead of Western Rome in grandeur and
power. The two parts had no natural border between them and so
they were occasionally at war with one another.

298

History of Islam

At the time of the birth of the Prophet :i, Nushirwan Sassani was the
emperor of Persia and his grandson Chosroes (Khosrau) was the ruler
when Muhammad ~ was honored with Prophethood . Rebellion
broke out against Caesar Publius, his nobles and the subjects
dethroned and killed him. Heraclius, the son of the governor of
African territories was enthroned in Constantinople as the Caesar. In
the meantime the Persians and the Romans rose up against each other
and the war between the two dragged on for six or seven years.
During the eighth year of Prophethood, the Persians conquered Syria
and took away the Cross when they captured Bait-ul-Maqdis
(Jerusalem) .
The polytheists of Makkah expressed wild jubilation at the victory of
the Persians, for the Persians were polytheists while the Romans were
people of the Book. The Muslims naturally had sympathy for the
Romans, so it was sad news for them. Allah the Almighty revealed
the Verses of Surat Ar-Rum and let them know that although Rome
had been defeated at that time, but in a few years they would gain
victory to the rejoicin g of the Muslims and so it happened. Heraclius
rose from the position of defeat and frustration and after preparing
for six or seven years with indomitable courage and d etermination,
took his revenge on the Persians on the battlefield of Syria.
The Romans defeated the Persians on one hand, and about the same
time, the Makkan disbelievers tasted a crushing defeat at the hands of
the Muslims on the other. Thus the prophecy of the Qur'an came true
word for word. And with this, started a new spate of battles between
the two rivals, which came to an end only in 7 AH, when they at last
made peace after large-scale bloodshed and destruction. After
winning peace, both of them set out on the way to progress and
prosperity. It was the same year that the Prophet ~ sent invitation letters
to a number of monarchs.
Chosroes of Persia received the letter from the Prophet ~ at Mada'in
and he tore it up with disdain, while Heraclius of the Roman Empire
showed due respect to it. Not only did Chosroes show disrespect to
the letter of the Prophet ~ but he sent word to his governor Badhan in
Yemen to round up the Arabian Prophet and send him to Mada' in.
Badhan sent two p ersons to Al-Madinah who appeared before the

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

299

Prophet ~ and informed him of the royal order. The Prophet~ said,
"Chosroes, whom you treat as your god, has been killed by his son
last night." When both of them went back to Badhan they came to
know that Chosroes was killed by his son, Sherweh.
The assassination of Chosroes took place the same night the Prophet
~ referred to as the night when Badhan, the governor of Yemen
embraced Islam. With his acceptance of Islam, the religion of Allah
spread rapidly in the whole country. The Prophet ii approved
Badhan as the governor of Yemen. Sherweh was too deeply
preoccupied with his internal problems to turn towards the Muslims
and Arabia . After many turns of events, Puran, the daughter of
Chosroes Pervez and the sister of Sherweh took the throne but could
rule the country only for one year. The Prophet ~ passed away
during her time. After many successors, Yazdgurd was on the throne
of Persia when it fell to the Muslims. In short, the lofty palace of the
Persian Empire kept decaying day by day from the time the letter of
the Prophet ~ was torn up with disrespect.
The Persians, being polytheists, were most arrogant and haughty.
They looked down upon the Arabs and particularly the Muslims,
since the news of their strength and patience was a source of constant
mental trouble for them, they wanted to uproot them completely. But
Allah the Almighty had entangled them so deeply in family feuds that
they had no chance to look towards Arabia.
The Jews and hypocrites who were turned out of Al-Madinah, constantly
sent messages to the Persians and the Romans to attack Muslims in AlMadinah. Since the Heraclius' court was free from such plotting and
counter-plotting, he was in a position to implement the conspiratorial
suggestions of the hypocrites and the Jews of Al-Madinah.
The time when the Prophet ~ had sent his letter to Heraclius, he had
also dispatched letters to Busra and Damascus. But both the rulers illtreated the emissaries of the Prophet ~- Shurahbil, the sub ruler of
Busra had gone to the extent that he put the emissary to death. In the
battle of Mu'tah, Heraclius was on the side of Shurahbil Ghassani.
Following this, the Romans invaded Arabia and the Prophet~ went
to Tabuk along with his army. But the Romans evaded the battle.

300

History of Islam

The news of the Prophet's death stirred the atmosphere throughout
Arabia and this sad news brought both the Romans and Persians to
heave a sigh of relief. Since Arabia had risen on the map of the world
for the first time as a country wielding, unity, courage, power and
influence, the Romans and the Persians could not but watch it with a
shade of care and anxiety. The tempest of apostasy added fuel to the
flames, with the result the Romans and the Persians began to collect
their forces in Syria and Iraq respectively. It was the height of
wisdom, prudence, military acumen and the courage of conviction of
Abu Bakr ~, which guided him to first eradicate apostasy and then
galvanize the whole country into fighting back the forces hostile to
Islam. It was due to the sterling qualities of the illustrious personality
of Abu Bakr Siddiq~, the first Caliph of the Prophet of Allah :i, that
he guided the destiny of Islam with unparalleled determination,
firmness, conviction and trust in such crucial moments, which had
brought soul-stirring challenges to the very existence of Islam,
immediately after the final departure of the Prophet of Allah :i.

Policy of the Muslims
Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ was well aware of the designs of the Persians
when he approved the departure of Usamah's detachment. At a time
when Al-Madinah itself was under great pressure, he adopted a
policy of buying time before opening a war front against the major
powers until the threat of apostasy was put down. He, therefore, sent
a small column to Iraq under Muthanna bin Harithah ~ not to start a
pitched battle but to function as a raiding party meant just to terrorize
the men in power so that the Persians dared not attack Arabia. He had
in mind the same purpose when he had dispatched Usamah ~
against the Romans.
When the situation in Najd and Yamamah came under control, Siddiq
~ addressed a letter to Iyad bin Ghanam ~ in Najd to take with him

those Muslims who were still beyond the reach of apostasy, and
launch an attack on the upper parts of Iraq. Following this, he wrote
another letter to Khalid bin Walid .te, in Yamamah to tum towards the
lower parts of Iraq. Both the Muslim commanders met at Uballah
according to the instructions of the Caliph.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

301

The Battle of DhJt-us-Salasil
When Khalid bin Walid ~ took stock of his entire army at Aballah,
he found that he had not more than eighteen thousand fighters. His
fresh target was Hafir, the Persian province of Iraq, and Hurmuz was
its governor who was well known throughout Arabia for his valor
and military skill. He was a terror for India also for he so often led
assaults on the Indian coast with his war fleet.
Khalid bin Walid ~ first addressed a letter inviting him to Islam. But
Hurmuz responded with leading a large and strong army against the
Muslim commander. With his instinctive military acumen, Khalid~
divided his army into three parts. He then handed over the command
of one part to Adi bin Hatim ~' another part he entrusted to Qa'qa'
bin Amr ~ and the third one he kept with himself. All the three
wings marched ahead to meet at Hafir with the difference of a oneday-journey and pitched their camps facing the Persian army.
First of all, Khalid bin Walid ~ himself came out and threw a
challenge to Hurmuz for a duel. He responded to the call and stepped
forward. Both the commanders got down from their horses. Khalid ~
was the first to strike. Hurmuz made a hasty retreat and parried the
stroke, then he struck Khalid with agility. Khalid~ got up quickly,
rushed forward and snatched away his sword by twisting his wrist.
Now Hurmuz clasped his body which led to wrestling between the
two. Khalid ~ lifted him high by his waist with lightening speed and
then threw him on the ground so forcefully that he failed to move.
Khalid ~ then got on his chest, cut his head off and threw it away.
When a squad of the Persian army witnessed its commander being
overpowered, it moved ahead to help him but Qa'qa' bin Amr~
stood like a rock. Following this, troops from both sides fell on one
another and a fierce battle broke out in no time. But the Persians could
not withstand the heavy Muslim onslaught and fled in panic and
terror.
Hurmuz was such an exalted governor and commander among his
people that he wore a crown on his head. This costly crown came to
Khalid ~ and it was valued at one hundred thousand dinars. A

302

History of Islam

section of the Persian army had chained themselves with the
determination of winning or dying. But they had to break their chains
and flee leaving thousands of men dead and injured. This battle is
known as Dhat-us-Salasil because of these chains.
Khalid ~ asked Muthanna bin Harithah ~ to give chase to the
fleeing Persian fighters. The Muslim forces laid siege round the
citadel of Hisn-ul-Marah and conquered it putting the ruler to death.
His wife accepted Islam and desired to be married to Muthanna ~-

The Battle of Qarin
In response to Hurmuz's call for help, a large troop of reinforcements
was immediately sent by the Persian ruler. The frustrating news of
Hurmuz's death and his fleeing soldiers greeted it on the way. The
fresh fighters of the reinforcements encouraged them to have a fresh
encounter with the Muslim troops. They encamped at a canal and the
Muslim fighters marched on to meet them. During the ferocious fight,
all the three generals, Qarin, Qibad and Anushjan, were killed leaving
behind thirty thousand fighters dead and a large number of the runa way soldiers drowned in the canal.
As a follow-up action after the conquest of the province, Khalid ~
made the inhabitants pay the Jizyah (tax) and appointed a Muslim
governor to run the administration according to Islamic law.

The Battle of Walajah
After Qarin and the other generals were killed, the Persian ruler sent a
well-known horseman Andarzagar to lead the Persian army which set
out from Mada'in and arrived at Walajah. At the back of Walajah was
dispatched another general, Bahman Jadwaih from Mada'in, at the
head of another very strong army.
However, Khalid bin Walid ~ marched with his troops and launched
an attack on the Persian army which was routed after a fierce battle.
Their general also died of thirst right on the battlefield. However,
Bahman Jadwaih reached Ullais and the Persian fugitives joined his
army. Many Christian Arabs also extended their unconditional
support to them.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

303

The Battle of Ullais
Informed of the presence of a large army at Ullais, Khalid bin Walid
~ himself marched ahead and launched his attack. Khalid~ first

called a man for a duel. Malik bin Qais was sent from the Persian
camp and Khalid ~ killed him. Now an all-out battle started, which
resulted in seventy thousand enemy fighters being killed at the hands
of the Muslims.

Conquest of Hirah
From Ullais, Khalid bin Walid ~ marched to Hirah and besieged it.
When the siege drew long and the citizens were tired of it, the chief of
Hirah, Amr bin Abdul-Masih along with others appeared before the
Muslim commander. The Persian general and army had already fled
in panic with the news of the demise of Chosroes Ardsher. AbdulMasih won peace in return for two hundred thousand dirhams as
tribute. After the conquest, Khalid bin Walid ~ sent Dirar bin AlAzwar, Dirar bin Al-Khattab, Qa'qa' bin Amr, Muthanna bin
Harithah and Uyainah bin Ash-Shamas ,$, at the head of small
columns to make the surrounding tribes and settlers accept either the
Jizynh (tax) or Islam. Thus the entire territory up to the Tigris fell to
Khalid bin W a lid ~-

Message of Khalid~
From Hirah, Khalid sent letters to the important personalities and
circulars to the feudal lords who were wise enough to obey the truth
and follow the good. In the letter addressed to the influential persons
of Persia he wrote:
"All praise is due to Allah Who created chaos in your system
and slackened your hypocrisy and broke your unity. Had we
not invaded this country, it would have been disastrous for
you. Now it is better for you to obey us and we shall leave your
territory and go somewhere else. If you refuse to obey us, you
will come across such people who love death as you love your
life."

History of Islam

Another general circular carried the following:
"Glorified is Allah the Almighty Who humbled your pride,
broke your alliance to pieces and razed your grandeur to the
ground. Hence do accept Islam and you will be safe or seek our
protection to become Dhimmi and pay the Jizyah, otherwise, I
have brought to you a people who keep death as dear as you
love drinking."
These letters and circulars brought unity among them and they
achieved success in choosing their king unanimously to face the
Arabian invasions.

Conquest of Anbar
The Persians collected a big force in Anbar and appointed Sherzad,
the ruler of Sabat as its commander. Khalid ~ marched from Hirah to
Anbar. Sherzad had erected a high mound of clay outside the
ramparts of their fort to consolidate his position. When Khalid~
surrounded Anbar, the besieged soldiers showered arrows on the
Muslim army with the result that the eyes of about one thousand
Muslim fighters were injured. But the lion-hearted commander of the
Muslim forces was not to be intimidated through such tactics and
devices. He outsmarted his enemy by slaughtering the weak and
exhausted camels and piling them up to reach the ramparts and then
beat the enemy thoroughly. Although the Persians showed courage
and gallantry, they had to surrender before the Muslims who outwitted
them in every department of warfare. When Sherzad witnessed that
Muslim victory was around the corner, he sent his men to Khalid~
on peace mission. He replied that he could allow Sherzad to leave the
city peacefully along with a few comrades with provisions for not
more than three days. Sherzad left the city and Khalid ~ entered it
victoriously. He then put Zabrqan bin Badr in charge of Anbar and
marched to Ain-ut-Tamr.

Conquest of Ain-ut-Tamr
Uqbah bin Uqbah heard of the advancement of Muslim troops and
contacted the Persian Commander Mehran bin Bahram to say that

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

305

only Arabs knew the war tactics of the Arabs, so they (Uqbah's men)
should be allowed to confront the Muslim forces. Mehran was happy
enough to give his consent to this proposal. Uqbah was too excited to
come out first and challenge for a duel. Khalid ~ stepped forward
and captured him alive, with the result his men fled in terror and
were also taken captive. Mehran bin Bahram grew so awe-stricken
that he fled his fort, which later fell to the Muslim army.

Upper Iraq
Khalid bin Walid ~ finished his task in a comparatively short period
but Iyad bin Ghanam ~ dispatched about the same time, was still
engaged on his mission. His target of attack was a large territory forming
part of Iraq, Iran and Syria and so his combats affected Persia and
Heraclius equally. The time when Khalid ~ conquered Ain-ut-Tamr,
Iyad engaged the rulers of Dumat-ul-Jandal after winning victories over
the polytheists and Christian tribes. Dumat-ul-Jandal had two rulers,
Ukaidir bin Malik and Judi bin Rabi'ah, who had collected all the
Christians of the surrounding areas against the Muslims. In this
distressing situation, Iyad ~ addressed a letter to Khalid~' who was
then at Ain-ut-Tamr, to come to his help against the huge army of the
enemy.

Conquest of Dumat-ul·]andal
Khalid bin Walid ~ appointed Qa'qa' bin Amr ~ his deputy in
Hirah and proceeded to Dumat-ul-Jandal without loss of a moment. The
burning news of Khalid's arrival was so terrifying that Ukaidir
counseled Judi to make peace with the Muslims but he and other
Christian chiefs rejected the proposal outright. At last Ukaidir broke
his relations with them and left alone for some unknown place. A
small column of the Muslims intercepted him on the way and he died
fighting. Khalid ~ launched his attack from another side and
challenged the enemy commander for a duel. Judi stepped forward
and was captured by Khalid bin Walid ~ in no time, with the result
his men fled the battleground. Simultaneously, Iyad bin Ghanam ~
also prevailed over his Christian opponents and made them flee for
their lives.

History of Islam

The Battle of Husaid
When the Persians noticed that Khalid bin Walid ~ was away from
Hirah, they made an all-out effort to take back the province and turn
out the Muslim administrators from the territory. The Arabian tribes
also lent their support to avenge the killing of their chief, Uqbah bin
Uqbah. Two well-known Persian generals Zarmahr and Rozbah
marched at the head of a huge army. Qa'qa' bin Amr~' the deputy
of Khalid ~ in Hirah, also divided his force in two parts, under Abu
Laila ~ and himself and challenged the enemy at Husaid.
After a heavy fight, both the generals and more than half of their
army fell to the Muslim assault. The rest of their men fled to Khanafis
where their commander Bahbudhan was lying with a large army.
When Abu Laila ~ reached Khanafis in pursuit of the fugitives,
Bahbudhan fled to Mudaiyah where Hudhail bin Imran along with
other Arabian chiefs were awaiting the opportunity to engage the
Muslims in a battle. In the meantime, Khalid bin Walid ~ finished
his task in Dumat-ul-Jandal and hurried back to Hirah.

The Battle of Mudaiyah
Khalid ~ took over the command of the entire Muslim army and
divided it in three parts to attack from three different sides. Qa 'qa',
Abu Laila and Khalid :$, himself attacked from three sides as already
decided upon. Hudhail fled for his life but the other generals along
with a large number of men were put to death. Among the persons
killed were Abdul-Uzza bin Abu Ruhm and Labid bin Jarir who sided
with the opponents of Islam under compulsion in spite of being
Muslims.
When Abu Bakr ~ came to know of this, he paid blood money to
their relatives and ordered to treat their children well. Umar ~ was
already angry with Khalid ~ on account of Malik bin Nuwairah's
assassination, and this incident added fuel to the flames. However,
Abu Bakr ~ did not seek any explanation from Khalid bin Walid ~
and exonerated him with the remark: "Anyone who accompanies the
polytheists will meet with the sa me calamity."

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

The Battle of Firad
Firad was the meeting-ground of Persia, Syria and Arabia, and was
adjacent to Dumat-ul-Jandal. It was the place where Banu Taghlib,
Banu Namir and Banu Jyyad had already collected and the Roman
army was camping nearby to back them. Now the series of battles
fought with the Persian forces in the lower areas of Iraq had reached
the Roman camp.
Khalid bin Walid ~ arrived at Firad to give battle. The Roman army
was across the river Euphrates and sent a message to the Muslim
commander to either cross the river or let them cross it. Khalid 4,
asked them to cross the river and they did. Now both the forces were
facing each other on the same side of the river. The Muslim army was
extremely exhausted on account of the continuous travelling and
fighting while the Romans were fresh and about eight or ten-fold
more in number. However, the battle broke out and went on the
whole day. At last the Romans fled the field tasting their worst defeat
and leaving behind one hundred thousand dead. After finishing this
job, Khalid ~ sent his army back to Hirah and he himself left secretly
for Makkah to perform Hajj in the company of only a few persons.
After the Hajj, Khalid ~ hurried back to Hirah. But the news of his
journey to Makkah could not be kept secret and it gradually reached
the ears of Abu Bakr Siddiq ~- He, however, asked Khalid ~ not to
repeat it in future and expressed his displeasure over this act of
carelessness.
Khalid bin Walid ~ stayed in Hirah up to Rabi' Al-Awwal 13 AH,
which he had entered in Muharram 12 AH. During this period he
faced his enemies at every step and fought scores of fierce battles
against formidable armies outnumbering Islamic forces in every battle
but beating them thoroughly in each one and never tasting defeat in
any battle. The Roman and Persian powers used to be shuddered
from within at the mention of Khalid bin Walid's name.
Human history can not perhaps, give any other example of so many
successive victories in so short a period with so little resources. But
Khalid ~ did it. He deserves all of the blessings of Allah that we can

History of Islam

308

seek for him and for his matchless military acumen, dauntless
courage, unflinching determination and daring operations.
However, we can not ignore the spirit behind all his deeds of wonder
and the spirit is that of his selection, training and guidance in Siddiqi
style and manner. Muslim columns and troops wherever they fought
and whatever lines of operation they adopted were as per the
instructions given from Al-Madinah, the headquarters of Islam. In all
situations and circumstances, the Caliph of the Prophet ~ kept
himself acquainted with the details of the movements of the Muslim
forces and never made any delay in sending the instructions bestsuited to the situation.

Khalid bin Walid •

in Syria

The military operations of Khalid not only uprooted the apostasy
from Arabia but also took away from the Persians the courage to
invade Al-Madinah as part of their strategy. Now the first and the
most important issue that demanded their immediate attention was
the Syrian front under the Romans and the Ghassanids. Shurahbil bin
Amr, the Ghassani king had martyred the emissary of the Prophet ~ ,
which led to the battle of Mu'tah. Besides, the joint forces of the
Romans and the Gassanids were ready to invade Al-Madinah and the
Prophet ~ himself went up to Tabuk to ward off their evil intentions.
Again, the news of huge military preparations at the Syrian borders
led the Prophet ~ to send an army under the command of Usamah
bin Zaid ~- Even in the thick of military actions against the apostates
the Caliph could not afford to ignore the Syrian threat and sent Khalid
~ to deal with the Syrians.
Khalid bin Walid ~ left the headquarters with a small column but he
took within him, according to the Caliph's instructions, Muslim fighters
from the regions and territories that were on his way. Despite this,
Khalid ~ was instructed to avoid direct encounter with the Christian
army. Internal problems of Arabia and the issue of apostasy topped
his list.
When Heraclius came to know of the presence of the Muslim army
within the bounds of Syria, he incited the surrounding tribes and the

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

309

notables of the area against the Muslims. At last Heraclius made
Mahan, a well-known Roman general, go ahead with a huge army. As
a result of the encounter, the troops under Mahan tasted ignominious
defeat besides leaving a large quantity of booty. Informed of this
defeat, Heraclius himself proceeded from Constantinople, came to
Syria and collected a huge army to avenge the defeat.
Khalid sent a detailed account of the state of affairs to the Caliph. The
day the letter was received in Al-Madinah, was the day when Ikrimah
bin Abu Jahl returned to Al-Madinah after his arduous campaigns. At
this time, tribes and clans from all over Arabia were pouring into the
headquarters with the sole purpose of laying down their lives in the
way of Allah.
Siddiq ~ sent Ikrimah ~ to assist Khalid~ in his campaign. Close
on his heels was dispatched Amr bin Al-As ~ with a detachment to
help Khalid bin Walid ~ by targeting the Romans in route to
Palestine. As a follow-up action, the Caliph sent a detachment of
tribes from various parts of Arabia under the command of Yazid bin
Abu Sufyan with instructions to invade Damascus.
One more detachment headed by Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ was
dispatched to attack Hims. He sent yet another detachment headed by
Shurahbil bin Hasanah ~ , after he returned to Al-Madinah from his
campaign in Iraq, to launch an attack from the side of Jordan. These
four strong detachments went to attack Syria from four sides. This
campaign took place in Muharram 13 AH.
When all the four detachments crossed into Syria, and Heraclius came
to know that the Muslim force has divided itself in four groups to
attack four positions, he also made four groups of his army to be
commanded by four generals. He sent his full brother, Tadharaq at
the head of 90 thousand armed men to face Amr bin Al-As ~ in
Palestine. Jurjah bin Budhiyah was given 40 thousand soldiers to
combat Yazid bin Abu Sufyan in Damascus. General Raqis was
dispatched with an army of 50 thousand men to fight with Shurahbil
bin Hasanah ~ in Jordan and Rafiqa bin Nasturas was asked to take
on Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ in Hims with 60 thousand men under his
command.

310

History of Islam

Thus, he collected two hundred and 40 thousand troops strong to go
to war against the Muslims, who were altogether 30 thousand in
number. It makes it clear what kind of major preparations, Heraclius
had undertaken to rout the Muslim forces. Although Heraclius was
wise enough to avoid the battle, his courtiers, nobles and chiefs were
adamant in their ambition to invade Arabia.
Although the Muslim generals were making separate movements,
each of them was bound by the Caliph's order to keep close contact
and be aware of one another's state of affairs. When the Muslim
commanders entered Syrian territory, they found to their amazement
that for each Muslim detachment the enemy had eight times more
forces. They took stock of the situation and informed Abu Bakr Siddiq
~ of what they were facing at the time and took a decision to jointly
face the enemy. As the four Muslim generals assembled at Yarmuk,
they received orders from the Caliph to face the enemy jointly.
Moreover, the Caliph sent orders to Khalid ~ to rush to the spot of
danger with half of the troops and put Muthanna bin Harithah d'$J in
Hirah with the other half. He was also commanded to take charge of
the joint command as the supreme commander. With the receipt of
these orders from headquarters, Khalid bin W alid ~' the Sword of
Allah, hurried to Syria with a contingent of ten thousand soldiers
leaving an equal number in Hirah.
Following the Muslim strategy, Heraclius also ordered his
commanders to form a united front. His full brother Tadharaq headed
the huge army of Heraclius. Besides, he dispatched a well-known
general, Mahan with a large detachment to strengthen the army
arranged against the Muslim forces.

The Battle of Yarmuk
Khalid ~ examined the situation like a seasoned commander. One
night he sensed the enemy would attack the next morning, and that
night he divided his army of about 40 to 46 thousand into small
squads headed by separate commanders of high caliber, keeping a
small but selected squad for his own company. He then instructed the
head of every squad about the strategy to be followed.

i

The Romans proceeded with the attack with a contingent of 40
thousand soldiers, which was immediately repulsed. Next came the
noted Roman general Jurjah bin Budhiyah with his column and
expressed his desire to talk to Khalid bin Wa lid ~- When Khalid ~
moved near to him, he wished to know about Islam, which the
Muslim commander did adequately. H e embraced Islam on the spot
and moved along with Khalid ~ to become a part of the Muslim
army. He then fought against the Romans gallantly and then fell
martyred .

l

Both the armies were locked together in a fierce fight. Although the
Muslim army was deficient in number, it was more than a match for
the Romans in courage and vitality. Their fervor was so high that
even women plunged into the battlefield to prove their mettle as
fighters for Islam. Abu Sufyan ~ was encouraging the Muslim
soldiers with his martial songs. Mean while Ikrimah ~ cried out:
"Who are they to promise me about death?" Dirar bin Azwar ~ and
other four hundred men pledged their allegiance at the time on either
being martyred or victorious on the battlefield. Following this, the
entire party fell on the Roman army like hungry tigers. Miqdad ~
was reciting aloud Verses of St'imt Al-Anfal to produce in them the
spirit of martyrdom.
The brave sons of Islam Khalid bin Walid, Abu Ubaidah bin Jarrah,
Shurahbil bin Hasanah, Yazid bin Abu Sufyan, Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl,
Qa'qa' bin Amr, Abu Sufyan, Abud-Darda, Amr bin As, Harith bin
Dirar and Jurjah bin Budhiyah c$, performed such deed s of valor that
have never been witnessed before. From morning to evening swords
and daggers, arrows and spears remained in action. Zuh r (noon) and
Asr (afternoon) prayers were performed only symbolically while the
fighting was going on. The day drew to an end but not the battle.
Exhausted with the day-long opera tions and frustrated with failure
after failure, the Romans lost heart and began to retreat till they had
the mountain at their back, while the Muslims kept advancing and
pushing them back till they started to flee. The pursuing Muslim
troops forced them into the river, m any w ere drowned, and others fell
to their death. In this way, one hundred and thirty thousa nd soldiers
were killed. The rest fled for their lives.

312

History of Islam

The morning sun rose with the message of Muslim victory and the
Roman soldiers were nowhere to be seen. Tadharaq, the Roman
commander and full brother of Heraclius was killed along with a few
other generals. Three thousand Muslims were honored with
martyrdom. Among the martyrs the names of Jurjah bin Budhiyah,
Ikrimah bin Abu Jahl, Amr bin Ikrimah, Salamah bin Hisham, Amr
bin Saeed, Aban bin Saeed, Hisham bin AI-As, Habbar bin Sufyan and
Tufail bin Amr ,;,t, were of those well known.
The battle of Yarmuk is stated to have been fought in Rabi' Al-Awwal
or Rabi' Al-Akhir 13 AH. However, this does not appear to be correct.
The battle of Yarmuk must have taken place by the end of Jumada AlUkhra. The Muslim troops had conquered Busra before the Roman
army reached Yarmuk. Moreover, the news of the conquest of
Yarmuk had not reached Al-Madinah until after the death of Abu
Bakr Siddiq~- It is impossible that the news of the Muslim victory in
Yarmuk would have taken two or two-and-a-half months to reach AlMadinah.

Death of Abu Bakr Siddiq •
The battle of Yarmuk in Syria had left Heraclius bewildered for he
could not reason the crushing defeat of several hundred thousand
armored Roman troops at the hands of a handful of Muslims.
Dejected and embarrassed, he left Hims and proceeded to some
unknown place. However, before his departure, he laid stress on
strengthening the forts of Damascus and Hims. Damascus had come
under the siege of the Muslim army and the entire land of Syria was
about to be captured by them. Now, instead of looking towards
Arabia, they were anticipating their own death and destruction. The
green and fertile land of Iraq had already come to the Muslim fold.
Islamic rule was now engaged in expanding Arabian territory by
pushing the Persians and Romans back.
At the beginning of Jumada Al-Ukhra 13 AH, Abu Bakr~ caught a
fever and its intensity continued unabated for a fortnight. When he
grew sure of his last hours drawing near, he sent for Abdur-Rahman
bin Auf ~ and held consultation with him regarding the caliphate
and said, "What's your opinion about Umar?" He replied, "He is very

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

313

strict and severe in his treatment and behavior." Thereupon Abu Bakr
~ said, "His strictness was simply due to my softness. I have myself

examined that Umar was inclined to adopt a hard-line in matters I
happened to be polite about, but he always turned soft when he
found me strict. I think the caliphate will make him soft and moderate
in his opinion and approach." Following this, he called Uthman bin
Affan ~ and put the same question to him. He said in reply, "Umar's
internal self is better than his external one; he is superior to us all."
I

II When Ali ~- was consulted, he made almost the same answer. Then
came Talhah ~ and when Abu Bakr~ said to him, "I would like to
appoint Umar as the caliph of the Muslims." He said, "What answer
will you give to Allah the Almighty about what you have done to the
people you ruled over?" In response to this he said, "I shall answer
Allah the Almighty that I have appointed the best of Your creatures as
caliph for Your creatures." Having heard this, Talhah ~ kept silent.
Abu Bakr ~ asked Uthman ~ to put down his will, which is given
below.
"This is the pledge which I, the caliph of the Messenger of
Allah ~ have made at a time when his last hour in this world is
at hand and the first hour of the Hereafter is approaching fast.
In such a state, even a disbeliever comes to believe and a
transgressor too attains conviction. I have appointed Umar bin
Al-Khattab to be your caliph, and I have never fallen short of
your expectation in doing good for you all. Thus, if Umar takes
to justice and endurance, it is quite within my knowledge; if he
commits anything wrong, I am unaware of the unseen. What I
have decided upon is nothing but good. Everybody has to face
the consequences of his deeds."
'Those who ha ve wronged will come to know by what
overturning they will be overturned." (26:227)

Last Address of Abu Bakr Siddiq ~
When the piece of writing was completed, Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ asked
it to be read out to the people. Following this he came out in spite of
his precarious health condition and said addressing this audience:

314

History of Islam

"I have not appointed any relative of mine as caliph, and I have
not installed Umar as caliph on my own. I have rather done it only
after holding consultations with men of sound judgment. Are you
then agreed to his being your caliph?" Hearing this they said, "We
all agree with your choice and opinion." Following this he said,
"You should then carry out Umar's orders and obey him."
All the people declared their allegiance. Abu Bakr ~ then said
addressing Umar ~ in the presence of the audience:
"O Umar! I have made you my deputy for the Companions of
the Messenger of Allah :I;; keep fearing Allah from within and
without. 0 Umar! There are some rights of Allah the Almighty
related to night, which he does not accede to in the day;
similarly, some are the rights related to day, which He does not
accede to in the night. Allah the Almighty does not accept
Nawafil (supererogatory prayers) unless Fard (obligatory
prayers) are performed. 0 Umar! Those alone get salvation on
the Day of Judgment, whose record of deeds will be weighty,
while the deficient in virtuous deeds will suffer. 0 Umar! The
ways to success and salvation are found by following the Noble
Qur'an and what is right. 0 Umar! Don't you know that the
Verses relating to inducement and awe, warning and glad
tidings are revealed in the Noble Qur'an simultaneously so that
a believer keeps fearing Allah the Almighty and seeking His
forgiveness. 0 Umar! Whenever you find in the Noble Qur'an
mention of men of Hell, pray to Allah not to make you one of
them; whenever you find mention of men of Paradise, pray to
Allah to make you one of them. 0 Umar! When you will follow
these counsels of mine you will find me sitting beside you."
This piece of writing and will making were all done by Monday, 22
Jumada Al-Ukhra, 13 AH, and between the night of Jumada Al-Ukhra
22nd and 23rd, after sunset he breathed his last and was buried before
the Isha (night prayer) or at any time of the night.
His caliphate spanned over two-and-a-half years. Attab bin Usaid ~,
the governor of Makkah died the same day in Makkah.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

315

The day Abu Bakr ~ wrote his will and informed the Muslims that
the end of his life was near, Muthanna bin Harithah ~ returned to
Al-Madinah from Hirah (Iraq). When Khalid ~ proceeded from
Hirah to Syria along with half of the army leaving Muthanna ~ there
with the other half, the Persian general, Bihman Jadhwaih thought
that it would be easy for them to drive out the Muslims from Hirah.
Thus, he set out with a strong army. Muthanna bin Harithah ~
marched from Hirah to Babylon and repulsed his attack, chased them
up to Mada'in and then came back to Hirah.
In the wake of this ignominious and devastating defeat, the Persian
generals, ministers, nobles and chiefs buried their old differences and
rose together to avenge their defeat. A wave of fervor and courage
rose across the entire country. All the Persian tribes and chiefs of the
nation rose up to uproot the Muslims. Such a large-scale military
preparation worried Muthanna ~ who hurried to Al-Madinah to
acquaint the Caliph with the impending threat leaving Hirah in the
charge of Bashir bin Khasasiah ~ M uthanna ~ reached Al-Madinah only a few hours before the final
departure of the Caliph. However, the Caliph heard him with rapt
attention and instructed Umar ~ to do the needful. When Umar ~
went out, Abu Bakr~ said:
"O Allah'! I have chosen Umar as caliph after me for the welfare
of the Muslims as a whole and to remove all sorts of dangers
from their path. You know very well the feelings of all hearts.
After holding consultations with the Muslims, I have selected the
best · among the Muslims to take care of them and look after their
peace and welfare. Make the guardians of Your slaves trustworthy and firm for their lives, their safety is in Your Hand.
Make Umar a good caliph and his people be a benefit for him."

Impressions of Ali ~
As the soul-shattering news of Abu Bakr's death spread in AlMadinah, the whole city plunged into deep grief and untold woes and
turmoil. The dismal day of the Prophet's final departure cast its tragic

316

History of Islam

reflection once again. When Ali ~ heard this sad news he burst into
. tears, came to his house weeping and uttered at his door the following
words immersed in deep sorrow and profound pain:
"O Abu Bakr! May Allah show mercy to you. By Allah you
believed first of all in the entire Ummah and made your belief
the base of your behavior and manners. You were the man
excellent in trust and conviction, the most generous and the
greatest caretaker of the Prophet ~- You were the greatest
supporter of Islam and well-wisher of all creatures. In manners,
virtues and guidance you were close to the Prophet ~ most of
all. May Allah confer on you the best reward on behalf of Islam
and the Muslims. You affirmed the Prophet :i when others
denied him; you showed sympathy when others were
ungenerous to him; you rose to help the Messenger of Allah ~
when others held themselves back from help and support.
Allah entitled you as Siddiq (the Truthful) in His Book:
'And he who brought the truth and believed there in.' (39:33)
You stood like a rock in support of Islam and drove away the
disbelievers. Neither your argument was ever misdirected nor
your insight weakened; your soul never showed timidity. You
were firm like a mountain; strong winds failed to uproot or stir
you. About you the Prophet :i had said: 'Weak in body, strong
in Faith, humble, exalted by Allah, venerable on earth and
worthy among the believers.' Nobody could show greed in
your presence nor could give free expression to his desires; the
weak happened to be strong to you and the strong weak till the
right of the weak was given to him and the strong was forced to
give what was due."
When Umar ~ heard this news he expressed his deep feelings in the
following words:
"O Caliph of the Messenger of Allah :i, you put your people to
great hardship with your departure. It is hard enough to be on
a par with even your dust. How can I vie with you? "

Governors of the Siddiqi Caliphate
The Trustee of the believers, Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ was in
charge as public exchequer, Umar ~ looked after the Department of
Justice and Uthman and Ali ~ were entrusted with the
administrative work and correspondences. In the absence of one, the
next would take over the responsibility. Attab bin Usaid ~ was the
governor of Makkah who passed away the day Abu Bakr~ breathed
his last. The governor of Ta'if was Uthman bin Abul-As ~ -San'a'
was governed by Muhajir bin Umayyah ~ and Hadramout by Ziyad
bin Labid ~ - Khaulan province was governed by Ya'la bin Umayyah
~, Yemen by Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ , Janad by Mu'adh bin Jabal ~,
Bahrain by Ala' bin Hadrami ~, Dumat-ul-Jandal by Iyad bin
Ghanam ~ and Iraq by Muthanna bin Harithah ~- Abu Ubaidah bin
Al-Jarrah ~ was later sent to Syria as the commander of the Muslim
forces, while Yazid bin Abu Sufyan, Amr bin Al-As, Shurahbil bin
Hasanah ~ were already engaged in Syria as commanders of various
Muslim detachments. Khalid bin Walid ~ was the commander-inchief of the Muslim army during the Siddiqi Caliphate.

Wives and Children
Abu Bakr's first wife was Qutailah bint Abdul-Uzza who gave birth to
Abdullah bin Abu Bakr~ followed by Asma' bint Abu Bakr ~, the
mother of Abdullah bin Zubair ~- From Umm Ruman ~ , the second
wife, were born Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and Aishah Siddiqah
$,. When Abu Bakr~ was converted to, Islam his first wife refused
to follow suit and was immediately divorced. The second wife, Umm
Ruman ~ accepted Islam. After being converted to Islam, Abu Bakr
married Asma'a bint Umais ~, the widow of Ja'far bin Abu Talib~'
who gave birth to Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ and then he married
Habibah bint Kharijah Ansariyah ~ who belonged to the Khazraj.
From her was born to him a daughter named Umm Kulthum after his
death.

History of Islam

Umar bin AI-Khattab ~
Birth and Pedigree:
He was among the nobles of the Quraish. During the Days of
Ignorance, diplomatic missions were attached to his family. In the
event of the Quraish being at war with any tribe, his family's leaders
would be sent on peacekeeping missions. They also took the lead
when there was occasion to highlight greatness and superiority of the
Quraish over others. His family lineage is as follows: Umar bin
Khattab bin Nufail bin Abdul-Uzza bin Riyah bin Abdullah bin Qurat
bin Razah bin Adi bin Ka'b bin Luai . Ka'b had two sons, Adi and
Murrah. Murrah was among the ancestors of the Prophet ~ - Some
eight generations back the ancestry of the Prophet~ and Umar ~
becomes common. Umar's filial appellation was Abu Hafs while the
Prophet ~ gave him the title of 'Fdruq'. He was born 40 years before
the migration of the Prophet ~- He passed his childhood days in
grazing camels. After attaining youth, according to Arabian tradition,
he was instructed in genealogy, swordsmanship, horsemanship and
wrestling. He adopted trade as his profession before and after
converting to Islam.

Some Specific Excellences:
Before being converted to Islam Umar Faruq ~ used to enter into
wrestling matches in the arena of Ukaz where a grand annual fair was
held so that the followers of different arts might gather from all parts
of Arabia and display their respective abilities. This justifies the
inference that Umar had attained perfection in the art of wrestling.
His claim to equestrian skill is also well established. Umar .l'.fo used to
literally jump on to his horse's back and his seat was so firm that he
appeared to be a part of the horse he rode. At the time of the advent of
the Prophet ti, as per Futuh-ul-Bulddn, there were only seventeen
persons in the whole clan of Quraish who could read and write, and
Umar ~' the son of Khattab, was one of them. He joined the ranks of
Islam after forty men and eleven women who were remaining in
Makkah after the migration to Abyssinia. According to other

narratives, he came to the fold of Islam after thirty-nine men and
twenty-three women or forty-five men and eleven women. He was
one of the earliest believers and among the blessed ten. He was also
the father-in-law of the Prophet :i. He is counted among the scholars
and pious Companions. He has narrated 539 Ahadith in all which have
been reproduced by Uthman, Ali, Talhah, Sa'd, Ibn Mas'ud, Abu
Dhar, Abdullah bin Umar, Abdullah bin Abbas, Abdullah bin Zubair,
Anas, Abu Hurairah, Amr bin As, Abu Musa Ash'ari, Bara' bin A.zib,
Abu Saeed Khudri i:.t and others.
Ibn Abbas ~ relates that the day Umar Faruq ~ accepted Islam, the
polytheists said, "Today the Muslims have settled their score with
us." The same day the following Verse was revealed:
"O Prophet! Allah is sufficient for you and for the believers
who follow you." (8:64)
Ibn Mas'ud ~ is reported to have said: 'The day Umar accepted
Islam, it continued to grow in honor. It was, in fact, a conquest for
Islam, and his Hijrah (migration) was a real victory, and his leadership
was a blessing. We did not have courage enough to perform our Safrit
(prayers) at the Holy Ka'bah until after Umar accepted Islam. He
made the disbelievers the target of so much pressure, encounters and
fightings that they, at last, yielded in allowing us to offer our prayers
at the Ka'bah." Hudhaifah ~ is reported to have said: "When Umar
accepted the Faith, Islam rose like a fortunate person making progress
at every step, and it continued retreating with his martyrdom and its
fortune was on the decline."
[bn Sa'd and Suhaib bin Sinan Rumi ~ reported: "Islam came to the
fore when Umar accepted Faith and we became able to sit around the
Ka'bah, and pay them in the same coin." Ibn Asakir reports Ali ~ to
have said: "Everyone migrated secretly, but, when Umar decided to
migrate, he took an unsheathed sword in one hand and arrows in
another and put his bow across his shoulders, and went to the Ka'bah.
He went around it seven times followed by two Rakat of Salat (units of
prayer) at the Station of Ibrahim. He then came to the circle of the
chiefs of the Quraish and said throwing a challenge at them, 'May you
be disgraced! Whoever likes to see his mother without a son and wife

320

History of Islam

without a husband, should face me.' But none of them moved from
their place."
Imam Nawawi reported: Umar ~ accompanied the Prophet ~ in
every battle and kept firm on the day of Uhud. The Prophet ~ once
said, "I had a dream that a woman was performing Wudu' (ablution)
in Paradise sitting beside a palace. I inquired whose palace this was. I
was told that it belonged to Umar." Then turning towards Umar ~
he said, "The same moment your sense of honor came to my mind
and I went away from there." Hearing this, Umar ~ burst into tears
and submitted, "Shall I show my sense of honor to you?"The Prophet
~ once said, "I dreamt that I took milk and its freshness reached up to
my nails. I then gave the rest to Umar." "What is the interpretation of
this dream, 0 Prophet of Allah?" they asked. "Milk here means
Knowledge," the Prophet ~explained . The Prophet~ said, "Once I
had a dream that people were brought before me in their shirts, some
wearing them up to their chests, and some of them longer than this
but Umar's shirt was dragging." "What's meant by the shirt?" they
asked. "Religion," he explained.
On one occasion the Prophet~ said to Umar ~: "By Allah, Satan will
never tread the way you pass through." The Prophet~ once said:
"Had there been a Prophet after me, he would have been Umar." He
once said: "Umar is the lamp of the heavenly people." On one
occasion the Prophet ~ remarked: "The door to things useless and
futile will remain closed while Umar lives among you." He~ once
said: "Every angel of the heaven pays respects to Umar and every
devil on earth fears him." Ahadith from Abu Saeed Khudri ~ let us
know that the Prophet ~ said: "Each one of the Prophets had a
Muhaddith, if there could be a Muhaddith in my Um mah, he is Umar."
On being asked about the Muhaddith, he said: "One from whose
tongue angels speak."
On one occasion Abu Bakr ~ said: "None is dearer to me than
Umar." Ali~ is reported to have once remarked: "While mentioning
pious people, never forget Umar." Ibn Umar ~ is reported to have
said: "After the Prophet ~ ' we found Umar to be the most
intelligent." lbn Mas'ud ~ said: "If knowledge of the entire world is
put on one scale, and that of Umar on the other to be weighed, Umar's

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

321

will have the heavier weight." Hudhaifah ~ says: "Knowledge of the
whole world lies in the lap of Umar." He further said: "None has dared
to receive as much censure in the way of Allah as Umar did." Ali~
once saw Umar ~ wrapped in a piece of cloth and remarked: "None
is dearer to me than the one who is now wrapped in a cloth." On being
asked, Ali~ remarked: "Umar is full of firm resolve, consciousness and
courage." Ibn Mas'ud ~ is reported to have said: "Umar's excellence
is established by four things: firstly, he counseled the killing of the
captives of the battle of Badr which was followed by the Verse: 'Were
it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have
touched you for what you took.' (8:68) Secondly, he asked the
Mothers of the believers to observe Hijab and then the Verse
concerning Hijab was revealed and the Prophet ~ said to Umar:
'Revelation is caused in my house and you were already inspired.'
Thirdly, the Prophet's praying to Allah for strengthening Islam by
causing Umar to accept Islam; fourthly, he pledged allegiance to Abu
Bakr before anyone did." Mujahid said: "We would so often mention
that the devils remained in confinement during the caliphate of Umar
and got freedom after his death." Abu Usamah ~ said: "Do you
know who were Abu Bakr and Umar? They were like mother and
father for [slam." Ja'far Sadiq ~ said: "I am rather disgusted with
him who remembers not Abu Bakr and Umar gracefully."

Physical Features of Umar

•=

He was fair-complexioned inclined to redness. He was so tall that he
appeared to be riding while walking on foot. His cheeks were
deficient in flesh; beard was thick, moustache noticeable and baldness
in the frontal part of the head. Ibn Asakir relates: "Umar was tall and
solid with color inclined to redness, cheeks pressed, moustache
noticeable with a red halo. His mother was the sister of Abu Jahl and
hence Umar ~ called him maternal uncle."

Important Events of the Faruqi Caliphate
The Muslims at large took Bai'ah (oath of allegiance) at the hand of
Umar ~ in Al-Madinah on Tuesday, 23rd of Jumada Al-Ukhra, 13
AH. Abu Bakr ~ had issued the following instructions to Umar ~

322

History of Islam

after the arrival of Muthanna ~ on 22nd of Jumada Al-Ukhra, 13 AH,
and hearing from him the account of affairs:
"I am sure to pass away today. Thus, you will dispatch
Muthanna for fighting tomorrow before the end of the day. No
suffering whatsoever should hold you back from carrying out
the religious tasks and the Commands of Allah the Almighty.
You have seen what I did after the death of the Prophet ~ even
though it was the greatest calamity for us. When the Syrians are
conquered, make it a point to send back the Iraqis to Iraq for
they know their own business very well and they are at ease
only in Iraq."
The above words make it amply clear that from the day the Prophet ~
made his final departure to the day of his own last journey, every
moment of his life was devoted to Divine duties. He made no will
concerning his wives and children.
After accepting the oath of allegiance for his caliphate, Umar ~
aroused in the people the fervor for taking part in Jihad, but they
made no response and this state of indecision continued for three
days. Abu Ubaid bin Mas'ud Thaqafi ~ offered his name for Iraq on
the fourth day. He was then followed by Sa'd bin Ubaid Ansari ~ '
then by Sulait bin Qais . and many others. Thus was formed a large
detachment for Iraq. Umar ~ appointed Abu Ubaid bin Mas'ud ~
as commander for he was the first to show his readiness. He
to Iraq. The three-day silence of the
accompanied Muthanna •
people over joining the Iraqi detachment led the historians to think
that the people were unmoved because they were unhappy over the
dismissal of Khalid bin Walid. by Umar. when he took charge of
the caliphate.
However, this is a wrong and baseless notion. Nobody opposed the
step taken by Umar ~- Moreover, no historian has ever mentioned
the unhappiness of the people and how this unhappiness was
resolved. This is rather derogatory to the high ,status and pious
position that the Companions of the Prophet ~ enjoyed. It is a fact
that almost every one of them was always inclined to fight in the way
of Allah. However, each of them was waiting for the other to take

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

323

upon himself the responsibility of the campaign. The reason given by
these historians does not hold true and is illogical because the people
were encouraged to join the campaign and their initial lack of
response occurred before Khalid bin Walid ~ was deposed as
commander.

Khalid bin Walid ~ deposed
Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ had sent Khalid bin Walid ~ to Syria as the
supreme commander of the Muslim army. He was a warrior of the
very highest caliber and matchless as a commander. Khalid ~ was
also the commander-in-chief in Iraq at the same time. His amazing
valor and military acumen had left the Persian Court and Sassanid
Empire shocked and bewildered. The Roman Empire also needed the
same treatment, therefore, Abu Bakr ~ had sent him to the Syrian
front as the commander-in-chief of the Muslim army, and his decision
proved to be right. He gave them such a crushing defeat on the
battlefield of Yarmuk that the Roman Empire's back was broken. Now
the time had come for a decisive battle between the two forces and so
the Muslim army was urgently in need of a commander not only wellversed in the art of warfare but also a statesman of wide experience
and broad vision.
Umar Farug ~ did not disapprove of Khalid's martial abilities.
However, he considered him a little careless and was, therefore,
apprehensive that his lack of caution could possibly cause the
Muslims a set back. Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ also shared the anxiety of
Umar Farug ~- However, he, considered Khalid ~ as the most
suitable for the initial campaigns in Syria and Iraq. To him as a whole,
his strong points were more than the weak ones. But, since, this
purpose had already been achieved, his continuation as the supreme
commander was no longer necessary. Umar Farug ~ used to say:
"May Allah the Almighty show mercy to Abu Bakr, he sheltered the
command of Khalid bin Walid, for he instructed me during his last
hours about the commanders fighting along with Khalid in Iraq but
uttered not a word about Khalid."

It is then clear that the steps taken by Umar ~ were not against the
will of Abu Bakr~- Besides, the very first act of Umar ~ could not

324

History of Islam

have negated the policy of the Caliph whom he held in the highest
esteem after the Prophet ~- Historians generally miss the point that
Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ had taken permission from Usamah ~ to keep
Umar Faruq ~ with him solely to seek his advice in state affairs, and
this enviable position Umar ~ enjoined till the last breath of the
departed Caliph.
But those who happen to have a superficial look over the matter, attach
wrong meaning to it. Umar ~ objected to some of Khalid's careless
acts and decisions no doubt, but his disapproval never made him
cross the limits of Shari'ah (Divine codes). The man who gave free
expression to his will that everyone among the captives of the battle
of Badr be killed by his own relative could not be accused of
nourishing a personal grudge against anybody. This is a calumny of
the worst nature against the tower of righteousness that Umar ~
was.
By deposing Khalid bin Walid ~, Umar Faruq ~ has set a shining
example of preferring Faith to this material world of ours. Khalid~
accepted the orders of his deposition without question and continued
to serve the new commander. Whenever the question of devaluing
one's own self-importance for the sake of Divine service will be
raised, we have the name of Khalid bin Walid ~ to present. This
exemplary supreme sacrifice of Khalid bin Walid ~ ' the Sword of
Allah, far exceeds his amazing and soul-stirring deeds of valor and
military genius in the battlefield where he was always victorious and
never tasted defeat in his entire career as a warrior. Both his martial
deeds and sense of Divinity and loyalty to the Chief of the believers
are deeds of Khalid bin Walid ~ that we can all be proud of.
Some historians have argued a very delicate point that Khalid bin
Walid ~ was deposed because Umar ~ wanted to infuse in the
mind of the believers that victories were achieved because of Allah's
help, and not through any commander however valiant and seasoned
he might be. This viewpoint also lends support to the replacement of
Muthanna bin Harithah ~ by Abu Ubaid bin Mas'ud ~- The
Muslim Ummah is sure to achieve its past glory in the world even
today if such examples of unity, integrity, loyalty and sacrifice are
followed.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

325

Among the foremost military services of Umar Faruq * after
assuming the caliphate was the deposition of Khalid bin Walid ~ as
the supreme commander of the Muslim army in Syria and his
replacement by Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ - The order was
immediately obeyed. However, after handing over the charge of
commander-in-chief of the Syrian army to Abu Ubaidah * ' under
him Khalid bin Walid ~ displayed gallantry and military skill of
such a high degree that historians are still wanting in words to
describe them. He not only fought more efficiently and relentlessly
under the command of Abu Ubaidah * ' he also gave him valuable
and expert advice whenever needed. History has no other example to
offer in the annals of military service to compare with what Khalid
bin Walid ~ did as the deposed commander of the same army. It
only happened simply because of a high sense of duty to Allah, a
deep love for His religion and a profound attachment to His slaves.
The next job the Caliph did was the installation of Abu Ubaid bin
Mas'ud ~ as the commander-in-chief of the entire Muslim army in
Iraq. The third order of the Chief of the believers came in the form of
dispatching Ya'la bin Umayyah ~ to Yemen to fulfil the last will of
the Prophet ~ to drive out every Jew and Christian from the soil of
Arabia. It was not accomplished during the caliphate of Abu Bakr*
owing to the uprisings and attacks that needed immediate attention.

Banishment of the Najran Christians
Umar Faruq ~ asked Ya'la bin Umayyah * to go to Yemen and tell
the Christians of Najran to leave the country and that they would be
provided with land that was more fertile plus other facilities in Syria.
Some narrow-minded persons hold this banishment of the Christians
as an unjust step. However, these people ignore the evil designs and
conspiratorial activities of the Jews of Al-Madinah injurious
,. to the
Muslim cause. They overlook how they incited the Romans to invade
Al-Madinah. !he Christians of Najran were playing the same role
against the Muslims in that area. Since the Prophet~ was well-aware
of the usurious and anti-Islamic activities of the Jews and the
Christians of Al-Madinah and Najran, he wanted them to be driven
off Arabian soil lest their evil habits made inroads into the Muslim

326

History of Islam

society. The agreement signed by the Prophet ~ and the Najran
Christians included as one of the conditions that they would give up
the practice of usury but they failed to implement it. Thus, they
deserved such an extreme step by involving themselves in
collaboration with the Romans on one hand and hatching conspiracies
against the Muslims on the other. We so often come across in history
books, newspapers and magazines how people have been or are now
being exiled by the civilized nations forcing them to leave hearth and
home, wealth and property, they are even indulged in the mass
killings also on a very large scale. In comparison to these exiles and
brutal killings, the exile of the Christians of Najran was very humane.

Conquest of Damascus
After a major defeat at the hands of the Muslim troops in the battle of
Yarmuk, the Roman soldiers took to their heels and stopped only at
Pihl. Heraclius shocked and disappointed issued fresh orders for the
Roman soldiers to assemble again. Damascus was refortified and
large reinforcements from Palestine and Hims were arranged. Nastas
bin Nasturas was appointed the commander-in-chief of the Syrian
forces. Mahan, the governor of Damascus was already there.
The Muslim army was still in Yarmuk. Abu Ubaidah bin Jarrah ~
dispatched the Iraqi detachment accompanied by Khalid bin Walid ~
to Iraq under the command of Hashim bin Utbah ~asper the orders
of the Caliph. He sent a contingent towards Pihl and the rest of the
army was divided into a number of divisions. A column was sent
under the command of Dhul-Kala'~ to obstruct the movement of the
Roman reinforcements from Hims to Damascus, and another column
was sent to stop them marching from Palestine to Damascus. Abu
Ubaidah ~ himself proceeded to Damascus at the head of the
remaining troops. He conquered Ghutah before reaching Damascus
and then laid a siege around the city in the last of Rajab 13 AH.
Although the city contained a large garrison, the Romans could not
muster enough courage to face the Muslims in the open. They had to
take refuge in their strong fortifications and use defensive means of
war. Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ camped at Al-Jabiah gate while
Khalid bin Walid ~ and Amr bin Al-As~ moved towards Tuma

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

327

gate, and Shurahbil bin Hasanah ~ and Yazid bin Abu Sufyan ~
appeared respectively at Farawis, and Saghir and Kisan gates. Thus,
Damascus was besieged on all sides. At times the besieged Romans
hurled stones through catapults and shot arrows at the Muslim
soldiers, which were countered effectively and without delay. The
siege dragged on for about six months. The reinforcements dispatched
by Heraclius to Damascus were effectively intercepted by DhulKala '~ . At last, the people of Damascus lost hope of Heraclius' help
and their zeal for battle began to dissolve. Abu Ubaidah ~ on being
informed of their distress and despair, issued orders to all the
commanders to launch a full-scale attack the next morning.
When the besieged Romans came to know of the next step of the
Muslim army, a deputation appeared before Khalid bin Walid ~ at
Tuma gate and sought peace, which the Muslim commander
immediately granted and entered the city without any fight. The
peace document written by Khalid bin Walid ~ is given below:
"Khalid bin Walid has made concessions for the people of
Damascus that they will be granted peace on the entry of the
Islamic army into Damascus and their lives, properties and
churches would remain safe and intact. Moreover, neither
fortifications of the city nor the houses will be demolished nor
any member of the Islamic force will be allowed to reside in
any house. The Muslims and their Caliph will practice nothing
but good to the people of Damascus while they keep paying the
Jiziyah (tax) ."
About the same time that Khalid bin Walid ~ entered the city with
the peace agreement, other commanders and their men forced into the
city through ladders and by breaking the gates open. Khalid~ and
Ubaidah ~ came across each other in the middle of the city. Abu
Ubaidah ~ claimed that he had conquered the city with his sword
while Khalid ~ argued that he had seized it through the process of
peace.
Some narratives lend support to the view that even if the peace
agreement was signed at the request of Mahan, the governor of
Damascus, he also wanted to see the might of the Muslim forces. If the

328

History of Islam

Muslim assault met with failure, their defensive efforts would
continue not caring the least for the peace document with Khalid bin
Walid ~, but if the Muslim campaign was crowned with success and
they made their entry by force, these documents would come to their
rescu e. When the two commanders met in the middle of the city, the
question that came up was whether the city was peacefully seized or
conquered by force. Some people argued the point that since Khalid
~ was simply a commander, he had no right to write a peace
document when the commander-in-chief was there to take a final
decision. However, Abu Ubaidah bin Jarrah ~ rejected this point by
saying that if peace or shelter was provided even by an ordinary
member of the army, it applied to everyone. He declared peace to
prevail in the entire city according to the peace docum ent of Khalid
~ and every point therein was handled with due care. The citizens of
Damascus enjoyed perfect peace. Yazid bin Abu Sufyan ~ was
appointed as the governor of Damascus who not only brought peace
to the city but let the Roman soldiers go at will.

The Battle of Fihl
Providing Yazid bin Abu Sufyan ~ with a strong con tingent, Abu
Ubaidah proceeded from Damascus to Fihl where Saqlar bin Mikhraq,
the noted general of Heraclius was lying with a few hundred
thousand soldiers. Before leavi ng Damascus, Abu Ubaidah ~ had
given the advance-guard to Khalid bin Walid ~ , the middle to
Shurahbil bin Hasanah ~, the right wing to Amr bin As~ and lead
the left wing himself, while Dirar bin Azwar ~ was given charge of
the cavalry and Iyad bin Ghanam ~ that of the infantry. Every
commander camped at the place of his own choice.
The Romans attacked the middle portion of the Muslim army in night.
Shurahbil bin Hasanah ~ came out in full force and fervor. The din
and bustle of military movements made the Muslim commanders
rush to the scene of fighting with their troops. The fi erce and hot
battle continued day and night for a couple of days. At last, the
Romans fled the field leaving eighty thousand men including the
Roman general Saqlar dead, and a large quantity of booty. After Fihl,
the Muslim army marched to Baisan.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

329

Conquest of B~isan
Here also they anticipated a fierce fight. The Muslim army laid siege
to the city and the fort. In the meantime Abu Ubaidah ~ was
informed that a Roman general had marched at the head of a huge
arm~, to restore Damascus. Abu Ubaidah ~ dispatched a squad of
horsemen headed by Khalid bin Walid ~- Yazid bin Abu Sufyan ~'
the governor of Damascus had moved forward to take on the Romans
when the detachment led by Khalid bin Walid ~ attacked from the
rear, with the result that not a single Roman soldier was able to save
his life. At last, the people of Baisan made an offer of peace, which
was immediately granted by the Muslim general and a governor was
installed there. Abu Ubaidah ~ then sent Abul-A'war As-Sulami at
the head of a division to Tabariyah where the Muslim forces won
victory without fight.

Conquest of Saida, lrqah and Beirut
Soon after exercising full control over Damascus, Yazid bin Abu
Sufyan sent his brother, Mu'awiyah bin Abu Sufyan to Irqah at the
head of a squadron who conquered Irqah without facing any
resistance. Yazid then turned to Saida, Habil and Beirut, and these
territories easily yielded to the Muslim attack. Thus, Damascus and
the entire territory of Jordan came under the control of the Muslims.

Campaigns in Iraq
The smashing victory in Yarmuk led the Muslim army to conquer all of
Syria. Now, they were looking forward to conquer Hims, the seat of
Heraclius.

First Deed of Abu Ubaid bin Mas 1 ud ~
As mentioned above, in the very first week after assuming the caliphate,
Umar ~ dispatched Muthanna bin Harithah, Sa'd bin Ubaid, Sulait
bin Qais and Abu Ubaid bin Mas'ud to Iraq. Even though Abu Ubaid
bin Mas'ud ~, the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi forces, left AlMadinah along with Muthanna bin Harithah ~, he stopped to take

330

History of Islam

with him men from the Arab tribes along the way and made brief
halts at different places, he reached Iraq one month after Muthanna
~- On reaching Hirah, Muthanna bin Harithah ~ saw with anxiety
that the Persians had roused all the Iraqi chiefs against the Muslims
and Rustam, the governor of Khurasan, had taken his position in
Mada'in after making massive military preparations. With the arrival
of Muthanna ~, Rustam sent a large army to combat him. Rustam
sent another huge army to Kaskar headed by Narsi, a very brave and
experienced general of the royal family. The third strong army he
entrusted to Jaban and sent it towards the Euphrates, they pitched
their camp at Namariq. Muthanna bin Harithah ~ on the other hand
came out from Hirah and camped at Khaffan.
Meanwhile Abu Ubaid bin Mas'ud ~ arrived and took charge of the
entire Muslim army. He left Muthanna ~ at Khaffan entrusting him
with the command of the Muslim cavalry and he launched a massive
attack on Jaban at Namariq and tore apart their ranks, with the result,
the Persians fled the battlefield. Jaban was captured by a Muslim
soldier, Matar bin Fiddah, who did not recognize him as Jaban, the
Persian general. Taking advantage of this, Jaban offered him two
valuable slaves in return for his freedom. He was freed but another
Muslim soldier caught him for he knew he was Jaban, the Persian
general. He was produced before Abu Ubaid bin Mas'ud ~ with the
report that he, the Persian general, had obtained safety by fraudulent
means. Abu Ubaid ~ probed the matter and found to his satisfaction
that the Persian general was given peace and safety by a Muslim
soldier. Thus, Abu Ubaid ~ released Jaban who joined his people at
Kaskar.

Conquest of Kaskar
Narsi was already encamped at Kaskar with thirty thousand soldiers.
Now Jaban and his defeated army also joined him. Informed of the
crushing defeat of Jaban, Rustam dispatched from Mada'in a huge
army headed by a noted general, Jalinus.
Abu Ubaid bin Mas'ud Thaqafi ~ engaged Narsi in battle before the
arrival of reinforcements from Mada'in. Two subordinate generals of
the royal family had been entrusted with the right and left flanks and

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

331

the main body of the army. In the Muslim army, the center was under
the command of Abu Ubaid ~ while the right wing was headed by
Sa'd bin Ubaid ~ ' the left wing by Sulait bin Qais ~ and the
advance guard by Muthanna ~- The battle soon became fierce. When
Muthanna ~ found the battle dragging on, he severed his column
from the army and launched a sudden attack from the rear on the
Persian army after making a circle of about eight miles. Narsi was
caught unaware. However, he turned a contingent towards the back.
But a massive attack from Sa'd bin Ubaid ~ created chaos in the
enemy ranks. Both Sa'd bin Ubaid and Abu Ubaid ~ went deep into
the heart of the Persian troops and had Narsi within their range. In
view of the situation the other Muslim fighters also plunged deep into
the enemy ranks with the cry of Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Most
Great).
The Persians could not withstand the assault and gave up fighting
particularly when they found Narsi retreating. Muthanna ~ chased
the fugitives and the rest of the Muslim army took a large number of
the enemy as captives and captured their camps and bazaars. After
finishing this arduous task, Abu Ubaid ~ sent Muthanna, Asim and
Sulait ,.t; to clear the surrounding areas of the Persian troops, and
they did their job adequately and appreciably.

The Battle of Baqshia
Narsi was defeated before Jalinus could join the Persian army. The
news of the smashing defeat led him to stop his movement at Baqshia.
Abu Ubaid ~ marched en route to Saqatiyah and Kaskar and
attacked Jalinus at Baqshia who fled the area and stopped only in
Mada'in.

The Last Deed of Abu Ubaid bin Mas'ud ~
When Jalinus reached Mada'in as a retreating leader, the seat of
power stirred from within. Rustam, the prime minister of the Persian
Empire, gave a call in the court packed with renowned generals and
valiant soldiers, "Who can stop the marching steps of the Arabian
army and avenge the successive defeats of the Persians?" "None other

332

History of Islam

than Bihman Jadhwaih can perform this feat," they all cried with one
voice. Rustam agreed and entrusted Bihman Jadhwaih with a wellequipped huge army along with three hundred combat elephants and
a large quantity of provisions. He was also handed the Kavyani
Banner, which the Persians believed made any army carrying it
invincible. Also, Jalinus was chosen to lead the reinforcements with
the warning that if he fled again, his head would be struck off.
Bihman Jadhwaih marched on with added confidence and
determination and he increased his already strong army with men
and materials from the tribes they came across on the way to their
destination. He pitched his camp at Quss-un-Natif near the bank of
the Euphrates.
Informed of this massive Persian military movement, Abu Ubaid bin
Mas'ud ~ also proceeded from Kaskar and camped at Marwahah on
the other bank of the Euphrates. The deep running water of the river
kept the two armies apart and silent for a couple of days. At last, a
bridge was constructed over the Euphrates with the common consent
of the rivals. On completion of the bridge, Bihman Jadhwaih sent
words to his counterpart to choose between fighting from this side of
the river or that. Although some Muslim officers were against the
Muslim army crossing the bridge, Abu Ubaid ~ led his army across
the bridge to the Persian side and drew the battle line. Bihman
Jadhwaih put the elephants ahead of his army with archers sitting on
them. Horses on the Muslim side had never seen elephants before and
they began to flee in terror at the sight of the huge animals. With this
scenario of the battle, Abu Ubaid ~ asked his men to fight on foot.
When the elephants began to trample the Islamic ranks under their
feet, Abu Ubaid ~ called out to strike their swords at the trunks and
he was himself the first to do this. He cut off the trunks of several
elephants and inflicted deep injuries on their feet with the result the
riders fell down and were killed.
Enthused with the matchless bravery of their commanders and
commanding officers, the Muslim soldiers made heroic assaults on the
elephants. During these fateful moments, Abu Ubaid bin Mas'ud ~
came under the attack of a combat elephant. He fell upon the elephant
and struck its trunk off with one stroke of his sword. Despite this the

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

333

belligerent animal knocked him down and put his foot on him
crushing his chest. Following his martyrdom, his brother Hakam
stepped forward and held the standard of Islam. An elephant too,
killed him. Thus, six more men from Banu Thagif who held the flag
one by one fell down martyred. The eighth one to hold the standard
was Muthanna bin Harithah ~- He took the standard in his hand and
encouraged his men with firmness but they appeared disheartened at
the loss of seven precious lives to the elephant attacks. Abdullah bin
Marthad Thaqafi rushed ahead and broke some planks of the bridge
to stop the Muslim soldiers from running away. He then called out his
men to fight and be honored with martyrdom like their brethren.
Muthanna ~ collected his scattered men and stood firmly against the
enemy. Abu Mihjan Thagafi and some other officers stood by him.
The bridge was repaired and the Muslim soldiers were asked to cross
the bridge to safety while Muthanna 4*, and the others stopped the
enemy from moving ahead. This battle took a toll of six thousand
Muslim combatants including valiant fighters like Sulait bin Qais,
Ugbah and Abdullah-sons of Qibti bin Qais, Abbad bin Qais, Qais bin
As-Sakan, and Abu Umayyah Fazari c$,. The Persians also lost about
the same number of men. The runaway Muslim soldiers remained
ashamed and repentant for a long time. This battle took place in
Sha 'ban 13 AH.

The Battle of Buwaib
When Umar Farug ~ came to know of the martyrdom of Abu Ubaid
and the heavy losses incurred by th e Muslims, he grew
exasperated and with all his energy and resources he commenced
preparations for a fresh campaign against the Persians. He dispa tched
heralds and emissaries to all the tribes and roused them to fight for
Islam. Several tribes poured in Al-Madinah and were dispa tched to
Iraq to lend their help to Muthanna ~ who had already launched a
recruiting drive, which resulted in a large army.
~

When the Persians were informed of these preparations, Rustam sent
a huge army under the command of Mehran Hamadani. The reason
for Mehran's nomination to the command was that he was brought up
in Arabia and could, therefore, realize the power and strength of the

334

History of Islam

Arabs and appreciate the magnitude of the task before him. Informed
of the Persian movements, Muthanna bin Harithah ~ marched with
his army and encamped at Buwaib, along the Euphrates. Mehran,
marching from the capital, advanced straight upon Buwaib and
pitched his camp on the other side of the Euphrates. He then sent
word to Muthanna ~ to either come to his side or let him come to his
(Muthanna's) own side. In the light of the bitter experience of the past,
Muthanna ~ invited him to his side. Mehran crossed the river with
his entire army and combat elephants. He then arranged his forces in
the manner that he put his infantry in the front followed by the
elephants with archers sitting on them and both right and left flanks
were occupied by cavalry divisions.
The Islamic army was also ready to fight. The Persians initiated the
attack, which was answered by the Muslims. The battle grew intense
and both sides displayed bravery. However, the Muslims were
crowned with victory. When Muthanna bin Harithah ~ noticed the
Persians running away, he rushed forward and broke the bridge, with
the result that a large number of the enemy soldiers were either killed
or drowned. Mehran Hamadani was also killed on the battlefield. As
per Ibn Khaldun's account, about one hundred thousand Persian
fighters succumbed to death, while only one hundred from the
Muslim side were honored with martyrdom. The Persian fugitives
were given chase up to Sabat. Now the entire territory from Sawad to
Tigris came under the Muslim forces. The battle took place in
Ramadan 13 AH.

After the Defeat of Buwaib
Because of the killing of Mehran and the large-scale destruction, there
arose a tremendous clamor in the imperial court as well as throughout
the entire Persian territory. The ratio of one hundred thousand
Persians lost to one hundred Muslims was really unbelievable and
shocking to the extreme. The result was a terrible terror and fear of
the Muslims came into the Persians' hearts. Although the real power
and administration lay in the hands of Rustam, the Persian throne had
a woman of the royal family to rule the destiny of its subjects. Now in
the wake of the smashing and ignominious defeat, all lips were

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

335

moving to say that they had tasted this defeat because a woman was on
the Persian throne. Thus the woman was immediately dethroned and
Yezdgird, a youth was installed on the throne. Rustam and Firoz were
the pillars of the state, but a violent friction raged between them. Now
both of them were persuaded to shake hands in the interest of the
Persian Empire. Other chiefs and nobles also buried their differences
and girded up their lions to serve their country even in the face of
death. The coronation of Yezdgird also infused a new life into those
who were disheartened because of the adverse state of affairs in every
field. The provinces and cities under the possession of Muslim officers
began to show signs of unrest and rebellion. The Persian camps were
packed with soldiers and the Persian forts and military outpost~ were
fortified and strengthened. Many other regions under the Muslim
control broke into revolt and rose in support of the Persians.

Umar Faruq's Readiness to face the Persians
Umar Faruq ~ came to know of these fresh developments in the
month of Dhul-Qa'dah in Al-Madinah. He issued prompt orders for
Muthanna ~ together with all the troops to fall back towards the
frontiers of Arabia . He summoned the tribes of Rabi'ah and Mudar
that were scattered throughout Iraq, and strengthened his forces and
vacated the threatened areas to ga ther close to the frontiers of Arabia.
He also issued orders to the governors to collect and send warriors to
fight in the way of Allah. As the season for the pilgrimage had
arrived, Umar ~ set off to Makkah.
On returning from the Hajj, he found Arab tribes pouring in AlMadinah from all sides. The suburbs of Al-Madinah were now
teeming with groups of warriors. He entrusted the divisional
command of the vanguard to Talhah ~ and that of the right wing to
Zubair ~ , while Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ was appointed to the
command of the left wing of the army. When the army was drawn up,
he put Ali ~ in charge of the caliphate, left Al-Madinah, and
advanced towards Persia. At Sirar, the first halt was ordered.
The fact that the Amir-ul-Mu'minin (Chief of the believers) himself was
leading the army, filled them with unbounded confidence and
enthusiasm. However, Uthman bin Affan ~ called on the Caliph and

336

History of Islam

said that it was not expedient that the Chief of the believers should go
personally into the battlefield. Following this advice, Umar ~
convened a general council of war at Sirar and invited the opinion of
everyone present. All unanimously exclaimed that the expedition
could not terminate successfully unless the Chief of the believers led it
himself.
Thereupon Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ said, "I disapprove of such a
suggestion. The Caliph's presence on the battlefield is too risky. In the
case, a commander is killed in action, the Caliph can do the needful
and keep the situation under complete control; but if Allah forbid, the
Caliph himself is eliminated, it would be extremely difficult to
manage the affairs. Ali ~ was also called from Al-Madinah to take
part in this crucial deliberation. He and the elite of the Companions
lent support to the opinion of Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~Umar Faruq ~ got up and made a stirring speech and it ended up by
addressing the people thus: "I had a mind to follow your counsel, but
the elite of the Companions do not agree to this view. Now who else
will do the job?" Following this decision, another problem raised its
head. Who will then play the crucial role of commander of the
Muslim army at this juncture? When Ali~ was proposed to shoulder
the responsibility, but he refused to it, Abu Ubaidah ~ and Khalid
bin Walid ~ were busy with the expedition in Syria. The people were
still in an uncertain frame of mind arguing about this question when
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ stood up and said: "I have found the man
and there could not be a better one." Saying this he named Sa'd bin
Abu Waqqas ~- The entire council agreed including Umar 4".,k. He
was exalted among the Companions of the Prophet ~ and was his
maternal uncle. Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ was then working among
the Hawazins as a collector of Zakat. A letter calling him back was
immediately dispatched. He came to the Caliph of Islam after a few
days. Until then the Muslim army stayed at Sirar.
After issuing the necessary instructions and asking him to keep the
headquarters aware of all the events and movements big or small,
Umar ~ dispatched the army under his able command . He set forth
from Al-Madinah at the head of a detachment made up of four
thousand troops and halted at Tha'labah after making eighteen

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

337

marches. Directly after the departure of Sa'd's men, Umar Faruq ~
sent a detachment of two thousand Yemeni soldiers and two
thousand Najdi soldiers to reinforce the main force. Muthanna ~ was
awaiting the arrival of Sa'd ~ at the village of Dhiqar, where he was
encamped with eight thousand men. It was Muthanna's intention to
join Sa'd ~ and to advance towards the Euphrates, but the wounds
which he had received in the battle of Jasr grew from bad to worse
and he finally succumbed to them.

Sa 1 d bin Waqqas ~ in Iraq
Marching from Tha'labah, Sa'd ~ pitched his camp at Siraf. On route
from Tha'labah to Siraf, three thousand warriors of Banu Asad joined
Sa'd's army under the order of the Caliph of Islam. At Siraf, he was
strengthened by two thousand fighters under Ash'ath bin Qais.
At the same place, Mu'anna bin Harithah Shaibani ~' the brother of
Muthanna ~ met Sa'd ~ and communicated to him the advice
bequeathed by his departed brother regarding the enemy forces and
their art of warfare. The eight thousand troops of Muthanna ~ joined
Sa'd ~ there. The troops were counted in round figures to be
between twenty and thirty thousand rank and file . The army included
three hundred Companions, who were present during the pledge of
Rid wan, while seventy of them had taken part in the battle of Badr.
Sa'd ~ was still at Siraf when he received a fresh order from the
Caliph directing him to proceed towards Qadisiyah. The order further
enjoined upon him to arrange himself in such a manner as to have the
plains of Persia in front and the hills of Arabia in the rear. In this way,
he might advance as far as he chose in case of victory and take refuge
by retreating to the hills in case of defeat.
Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ decamped as ordered by the Caliph and
nominated Zubair bin Abdullah bin Qatadah as the officer of the
vanguard. Abdullah bin Al-Mu'tasim was given the right flank,
Shurahbil bin As-Samt Kindi the left, Asim bin Umar At-Tamimi the
rearguard; Salman Farisi was the supply officer, Abdur-Rahman bin
Rabi'ah Al-Bahili the judge and treasurer, Hilal Hijri the translator,
Ziyad bin Abu Sufyan the scribe or secretary.

338

History of Islam

From Siraf, Sa'd ~ headed towards Qadisiyah and arrived at Udhaib.
Here the Persians kept their arsenal and military stores which the
advancing army confiscated. On reaching Qadisiyah, they had to wait
for the Persian army for about two months. During this long stay,
they would raid the surrounding Persian areas whenever they ran
short of provisions and other necessities.

Rustam's Departure from Mada'in
News began to pour into the Persian capital that the Arabian army
was encamped in Qadisiyah and they had ravaged the surrounding
areas of the Euphrates. The people of Qadisiyah and its suburbs
stormed the court with complaints against the raids of the Muslim
troops. They also threatened that if the needful were not done, they
would be forced to obey them.
Rustam was wise enough to advise evasion instead of an open
encounter. But the mounting pressure on Yezdgird, the Emperor of
Persia, forced him to call Rustam, his war minister, to take action and
go to Qadisiyah personally to bring an end to the longstanding
problem created by the Arabian force . Rustam was in favor of
dispatching a number of detachments one after another to keep the
Arabian forces too engaged to do anything anywhere else. However,
' Yezdgird disapproved of the plan outright with the result Rustam
came under pressure to leave Mada'in. He marched up to Sabat where
he was joined by forces from almost every part of the country in such
great numbers that, in a short time, the total number of the Persian
army rose to one hundred and fifty thousand. It was not only a wellequipped army but was showing a maddening rage and fervor
against the Islamic forces.
Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ informed the Caliph of the new
developments and enemy movements. Umar Faruq ~ wrote back not
to fear the least from the magnitude of the enemy forces and keep
faith in Allah the Almighty alone and seek His help and succor in the
present position. The Caliph also asked the Commander of the
Muslim army to dispatch a diplomatic mission to Yezdgird before
engaging the Persians in battle with the object of inviting them to the
Islamic faith . If the Emperor rejected the call, he would bear the brunt

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

339

of his refusal. In pursuance of the instructions from the Caliph, Sa 'd
bin Abu Waqqas ~ selected celebrated personages from the army
who were renowned in Arabia for their sagacity, eloquence, imposing
appearance, valor and ambition, and sent them from Qadisiyah to
Mada'in.

Islamic Diplomatic Mission
The diplomatic mission included men of towering stature like
Nu'man bin Muqarrin, Qais bin Zurarah, Asha'th bin Qais, Furat bin
Haiyan, Asim bin Amr, Amr bin Ma'dikarib, Mughirah bin Shu'bah,
Mu'anna bin Harithah, Utarid bin Hajib, Busr bin Abu Ruhm,
Hanzalah bin Ar-Rabi' and Adi bin Suhail ~. The ambassadors rode
straight to Mada'in at full gallop leaving behind the troops of Rustam.
Informed of the arrival of the ambassadors of Islam, Yezdgird
arranged his court in great pomp and splendor. When these Islamic
ambassadors, the sons of the desert, entered the court in simple
soldier-like style, the entire court was filled with wonder at the sight.
After a preliminary question and answer session, Yezdgird asked
with an air of self-conceit, "How did you dare face us? And how did
you forget that your people are considered as foolish and disgraceful?
Have you also forgotten that when you showed a sign of rising up,
our governors and junior commissioned officers were ordered to put
you right, and they did it." Having heard these words dipped in
arrogance, Nu'man bin Muqarrin ~ rose to answer with all the
confidence at his command . He said in plain words, "We are
determined to eradicate idol-worship and polytheism from the face of
the earth and present Islam before one and all, for it is through Islam
alone that man can attain peace and success. If anyone refuses to
accept Islam, it is better for him to entrust himself to the Muslims for
peace and safety and pay the Jizyah. In case he refuses to accept both,
Islam or paying of the/ izyah, the matter is decided by the sword."

Speech of Qais bin Zurarah
This speech enraged Yezdgird but he spoke with self-control: "You
people are simply brutes and much less in number. So you will never
be able to cover any part of our land. However, I can do you this

340

History of Islam

much as a favor that I will give you food to eat and clothes to wear
and appoint for you an officer to treat you politely."
Hearing this Qais bin Zurarah stepped forward and said: "These
personages before you are the very essence of Arabian society in
virtue of the various gifts of head and heart with which they are
endowed. Our noble chieftains and notables of Arabia are overtaken
by shame when making a reply to such rubbish. However, I seek to
reply to what you said right now and these companions of mine will
verify it. Listen! The wretched condition of the Arabs and Arabia you
have just described is far better than what we were existing in. But
Allah the Almighty bestowed His utmost favor on us when He sent
His Prophet to guide us and to lead us to the right path and put the
enemies of the truth and righteousness to disgrace and defeat and
promised us victories on earth. Now it is better for you to either
accept Islam or agree to pay us the Jizyah or you will have to cross
swords with us."
Having heard this speech, Yezdgird lost his temper and said, "Had it
been legitimate to kill ambassadors, I would have put to death all of
you." He then ordered his servants to bring a basketful of earth and
place it on the leader's head and he should be turned out from
Mada'in in the same state. He then added, "Rustam will shortly go to
bury you all in the trenches of Qadisiyah." Meanwhile the basket of
earth was brought in. Asim moved forward, put the basket on his
shoulder saying, "I am chief of the ambassadors." He then
immediately galloped off to Sa 'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ and said to him:
"Accept my congratulations, for the enemy has voluntarily
surrendered the earth of his territory to us." Sa'd 4*, expressed his
happiness over such an interpretation.
Followed by the return of the ambassadors, fresh orders came to
Rustam from the imperial court of Persia at Sabat along with
reinforcing parties. A greater part of a sixty-thousand-man army was
under the command of Rustam. The vanguard was headed by Jalinus
which consisted of forty thousand men; rearguard had twenty
thousand soldiers; the right wing commanded by Hurmuzan had
thirty thousand men while the left one under the command of Mehran
bin Bahram Razi also had thirty thousand troops. Thus, the total

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

341

number of Persian soldiers went up to one hundred and eighty
thousand. Rustam had in his direct charge one hundred combat
elephants while there were seventy-five elephants on the right flank,
seventy-five on the left, twenty in the vanguard and thirty in the
rearguard. Armed with war equipment and weapons on such a
massive scale, Rusta m marched from Sabat and camped at Kutha .
Now the distance between the Persian and the Muslim armies was
much closer. Small raiding squads would come out from both sides to
pounce on the other's provisions and other things of necessity.
Rustam preferred procrastination. He, therefore, spent about six
months in covering the distance between Mada'in and Qadisiya h. At
last, he was compelled to advance and face the Muslims. Pressing
injunctions urging him to attack the Muslim forthwith rocked his
command center. Contrary to the demand of the Persian Empire,
Rustam wanted to achieve success without an encounter. Now in
order to put off action still further, Rustam sent words to the Muslim
Commander, Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ to depute one of his trusted
men with whom the matter might be discussed.
Sa'd ~ sent Rib'i bin Amir ~- Rustam adorned his court with
unwanted splendor ,md pomp to prepare for the audience with the
Muslim ambassador. The entire court was carpeted with cloth of gold,
the pillows were of rich silk, while a gem bedecked throne was placed
in the center. Rib'i ~ came right up to the richly carpeted floor and
dismounting from hi s horse, attached the reins to a pillow. He them
moved on supported by a spear piercing into the carpet and cutting it
and making holes in it with its point and sa t beside Rustam. The
courtiers made an a ttempt to pull him down from the throne and
disarm him. Thereupon Rib'i .t"_,k, thund ered, "I have come on
invitation and not of my own. Our religion strictly forbids anybody
sitting like God and the rest standing before him with their hands
folded." Now Rustam intervened and asked them not to do anything
against the will of the envoy.
However, on second thought Rib'i ~ dismounted from the throne,
slit a portion of the carpet with his dagger and sat on the earth and
said addressing Rustam, "We are not at all in need of your carpet. The
earth spread by Allah the Almighty is enough for us." Rustam then

342

History of Islam

asked Rib'i ~ through the interpreter, "What is your object in
waging war against us?" Rib'i ~ replied, "We intend to bring the
slaves of Allah the Almighty to the expanse of the next world from
the narrowness of this world and promote justice and Islam in place
of atrocities and false religions. Anyone who adopts justice and Islam
will find us non-interfering in regard to his wealth, property and
country. But we shall fight with whoever stands in our way until we
go either to Paradise or attain victory. If you seek to pay the Jizyah, we
shall accept it and will cease to go against you and you will find us
standing by you if and when you need us for the safety of your life
and property." Having heard this Rustam inquired, "Are you the
chief of the Muslims?" Rib'i ~ replied, "No, I am an ordinary soldier.
But each one of us, even the most ordinary can speak on behalf of the
most powerful person, and every person has full power in every
matter."
The utterances of Rib'i ~ left Rustam and his courtiers dumbfounded. Rustam then said, "The scabbard of your sword is quite
rotten." Rib'i ~ drew his sword out of the sheathe and said , "But it has
been tempered very recently." Rustam again said, the blade of your
spear is very small. How can it be of any use in battles?" Rib'i ~ replied, "This blade pierces deep into the chest of the enemy and goes
across it. Have you not seen that a spark is enough to burn down an
entire city?" After this brief war of words, Rustam said, "Well, I shall
ponder over your utterances and hold consultation with my men of
sound judgment." Rib'i d-'.,k, got up and rode to Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas

~ Next day, Rustam sent a fresh message to Sa'd ~ requesting him to
send an emissary to him. Sa'd ~ sent Hudhaifah bin Mihsan ~,s,. He
also entered the court riding his horse giving an air of the same
stubbornness, which Rib'i ~ had displayed previously. He drew
dose to the throne on horseback. Rustam said, "What's the reason that
you have been sent today instead of the one who had come to me last
time?" Hudhaifah ~ replied, 'Our Commander does justice to one and
all and gives everyone an opportunity to do everything. It was his turn
yesterday and it is my turn today." Rustam then asked him, "How
much respite could you give me?" Hudhaifah ~ said, "For three days

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

343

only from this day." Rustam kept silent, and Hudhaifah ~ rode back
straight to Muslim camp. The stubbornness and presence of mind of
Hudhaifah ~ left Rustam and his courtiers astonished.
Next day again Rustam requested an envoy from the Muslim camp
and Mughirah bin Shu'bah ~ was sent to play his role. Rustam tried
both temptation and terror but Mughirah ~ remained unmoved and
paid him in the same coin. Helpless and embarrassed, Rustam said in
a fit of anger, "I shall never enter into any peace agreement with you
and I will kill all of you." Mughirah ~ got up and left peacefully for
his camp.

The Battle of Qadisiyah
Close on the departure of Mughirah ~, Rustam ordered preparations
for a decisive battle. A canal separated the armies. Rustam ordered a
bridge to be constructed over the canal, and it was completed within a
short period. Rustam then sent word to his counterpart as to who should
cross the bridge. Sa'd ~ invited him to cross. Thus, the large and
strong Persian army moved across the bridge and battle lines were
drawn up. Amr bin Ma'dikarib, Asim bin Amr, and Rib'i bin Amir~
moved through the Muslim army rousing the soldiers for Jihad, poets
went singing martial songs and the reciters of the Qur'an recited Surat
Al-Anja/. Sa'd ~ could not lead his army into the battlefield for he
was then suffering from boils and also sciatica, so he was unable to move
or ride a horse. Khalid bin Urfutah was, therefore, asked to command
the Muslim soldiers.
Hurmuz, a well-known Persian prince and wrestler came out first.
Ghalib bin Abdullah Asadi accepted the challenge for a duel and
advanced to meet him. Hurmuz was held in no time and brought to
Sa'd ~- Another eminent horseman from the Persian ranks threw a
challenge which was duly accepted by Asim ~ - However, a stroke or
two scared him off. But Asim ~ gave him chase and caught his horse
by its tail and dragged Hurmuz back from under the nose of the
Persian vanguard. The valor of Asim ~ maddened with anger
another noted Persian wrestler who moved forward with a silver
mace in his hand . Amr bin Ma'dikarib ~ advanced to meet his
challenge, apprehended him at once and put him on his side.

344

History of Islam

Now protests from the Persian warriors compelled Rustam to launch
an all-out assault on the Muslim troops, and by way of a war strategy,
combat elephants were set off to attack the Muslim ranks. Bujailah
tribe obstructed them at the cost of heavy casualties. Sa'd ~ w ho was
watchin g the battle scene very minutely, reinforced the Bujailah with
Banu Asad who showed utmost manliness in the assigned duty. But
when they also showed signs of reverses, the warriors of Banu Kindah
took the field and made such a heavy charge tha t the Persians were
forced to show their back. In view of constant retreat and repulses,
Rustam ordered a joint attack. Sa'd ~ cried Takbir (Alliihu Akbar Allah is the Most Great) at the top of his voice and the entire Muslim
army joining the Takbir of Sa'd ~ , charged the Persian troops. It
looked as if two oceans or mountains collided against each other.
When the rival forces were mixed up, the Persian elephants began to
cause heavy casualties on the Muslim side. Sa'd ~ immed iately
ordered the archers to shoot arrows at the elephants and their riders.
Asim ~ charged at the elephants with his lance followed by others
who commenced inflicting deep wounds on the elephants' trunks
with their spears and swords. With the result that the elephants
retreated leaving the Muslim swordsmen to display their mettle. After
an all day long battle, night intervened to stop it until the next day.
Early the next morning after the Fajr (dawn) prayer, Sa'd ~ buried
the m artyred in the eastern part of Qadisiyah. The engagement had
left a toll of five hundred men martyred on Muslim side. After
sunrise, the armies arrayed themselves against each other once again.
Fighting had not yet started when Muslim reinforcements from Syria
headed by Hashim bin Utbah were reported to be approaching. With
one thou sa nd fighters, the officer of the vanguard Qa'qa' bin Amr~
gave the news to Sa'd ~ and took the field with his permission. He
first challenged for a duel and Bihman Jadhwaih ca me forward but
was killed by Qa'qa' ~- After a number of Persia n strongmen were
killed, Rustam ordered an all-out attack.
Heavy fighting took place. Informed of the prevailing situation,
Hashim bin Utbah, the reinforcements' commander, divided his six
thousand strong detachment into small segments and each of them
entered into the battlefield with the cry of Alliihu Akbar (Allah is the

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

345

Most Great) at short intervals. This new development sent terror into
the hearts of the Persian troops. However, their combat elephants
were a menace to the Muslims even on this day. At last the Muslim
oldiers devised a new plan. They put on their camels long coverings
o that they looked like elephants, with the result that the Persians'
orses were scared off by the fearful sight inflicting on Persian army
ven heavier losses. Qa'qa' ~ killed many renowned Persian officers
nd well-known horsemen. The daylong battle left one thousand
artyred on the Muslim side and ten thousand dead on the enemy's
ide.
day, Sa'd ~ buried the martyrs just after performing Fajr
dawn) prayer and delivered the wounded to the accompanying
omen to be bandaged and nursed. Then the battle line was drawn
etween the two forces. The Persians put their elephants at the head .
owever, Qa'qa' ~ and Asim ~ launched together such a fierce
ssault on the leading white elephant that it fell dead. When another
lephant was targeted, it fled for its life and all the other elephants
ollowed suit creating havoc and causing tremendous loses to the
ersian side.
he two forces separated in the evening only for a short while after
ighting all day long. And the battle, which began again after sunset,
ontinued until the next morning. Neither Sa'd ~ nor Rustam could
erceive the battle conditions due to the darkness and loud battle
ries. Sa'd ~ , the commander of the Muslim army, kept praying
hrough the whole night. Sometime after midnight in the din of battle,
e heard Qa 'qa' ~ yell: "Gather together to attack the main body and
atch Rustam." This auspicious voice not only brought satisfaction to
a'd ~ but infused new courage and determination in the Muslim
roops.
xtremely exhausted after a day long battle, all the tribes rose as one
an to charge forcefully at the enemy. When the horsemen of Qa'qa'
J,:, reached near Rustam, he got down from his throne and began to
ight. However, on being wounded he took to his heels. But Hilal bin
llafah chased him and hit him so powerfully with his spear that his
1p was broken and he fell down in a nearby canal. Hilal dismounted
rom his horse at once, pulled him out by his legs and put him to

346

History of Islam

death. Following this Hilal called out at the top of his voice standing
on Rustam's throne: "By Allah, I have killed Rustam." Having heard
this announcement, the Muslim troops cried Alliihu Akbar (Allah is the
Most Great) and the Persian soldiers were left shocked and
astonished. They fled the battlefield. Out of thirty thousand Persian
cavaliers only thirty saved their lives. About six thousand Muslims
were honored with martyrdom. Sa'd ~ gave all the belonging of
Rustam to Hila! bin Ullafah. Qa'qa' ~ and Shurahbil ~ were asked
by Sa'd ~ to chase the Persian fugitives but Zuhrah bin Hawiyah had
already done this job and killed Jalinus who was collecting the
runaway Persian soldiers, and seized his belongings. Sa'd ~ had
some reservations about handing over the belongings of Jalinus to
Zuhrah but Umar Farug ~ ordered to give them all to Zuhrah and
appreciated his services. Immediately after the peace of victory
prevailed, Sa'd ~ collected the spoils of war and wrote a letter to
Umar Farug ~' the Caliph of Islam, giving him glad tidings of the
Muslim victory. A speeding courier was sent to Al-Madinah with the
letter.
Ever since the commencement of. the campaign of Qadisiyah, Umar
used to go out of Al-Madinah at daybreak and await the
messenger from the war zone. One day, according to his habit, he
went out of the city and saw a camel rider speeding from the opposite
direction. Umar ~ eagerly advanced and asked him where he wa
coming from? He said that he was coming from Qadisiyah with goo
news. Allah the Almighty has crowned the Muslims with a clea
victory. The Caliph began to make inquires from him. He wa
running by the side of the camel and plied its rider with questions
The camel rider on entering the precincts of the city found that ever
man whom they passed addressed his companion on foot as 'Amir-zil
Mu'minin'. He trembled with fear and said, "My leader, why did yo
not tell me your name so that I may not have been unwittingly guilt
of this misunderstanding?" Umar ~ reassured him observing: "D
not be uneasy. There is no harm done. Go on with your news." So h
walked by the side of the camel rider on the way to his house. The
convening a large conference of the people of Al-Madinah he to!
them the joyful tidings and made an eloquent and stirring speecl
which ended thus:
~

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

347

"O Muslims, I am not a king that it should be my desire to
make you my slaves. I am myself a slave of Allah, though the
responsibilities of the caliphate have been made to be heavy
upon my head. I should deem myself fortunate if I served you
in a manner that secured your sound and tranquil sleep in your
homes, but I would be a miserable wretch if it were my desire
to make you wait constantly upon me and mount a guard at my
doors. It is my object to instruct you not only by words, but by
my deeds also."

Conquest of Babylon and Kutha
After their flight from Qadisiyah, the Persians quartered themselves
at Babylon. A number of renowned generals set themselves to making
preparations for giving battle again. Fugitives of the battle of
Qadisiyah were also collected and encouraged to avenge their defeat.
Sa'd ~ stayed in Qadisiyah for about two months after the Muslim
victory. On receiving fresh orders from the Caliph, he marched to
Mada'in leaving his family in Qadisiyah. Before his departure he
dispatched Zuhrah bin Hawiyah at the head of the vanguard who
marched on killing, removing and enslaving his enemies until he
reached Babylon. Sa'd ~ also joined him there with his troops. With
the news of the arrival of Sa'd ~, the Persian generals left Babylon
and moved to Mada'in, Ahwaz and Nihawand destroying the bridges
on the way and making the Tigris and its canals impossible to cross.
When Sa'd ~ heard of the flight of the Persians, he sent Zuhrah at
their back and moved behind him at the head of a big army.
When Zuhrah arrived at Kutha, Shahryar opposed him and came
personally onto the battlefield, he challenged the bravest of the Arabs
to meet him in single combat. Zuhrah said, "I had intended to fight
with you, but in view of your bragging and vaunting, a slave will
confront you and he will put down your arrogance." Thus saying he
motioned Na'il bin Ju'shum A'raj, a slave of the Tamim clan, who
pressed his charger forward. Shahryar had the proportions and
strength of a giant. Seeing in Na'il a weak and puny adversary, he
flung away his lance and grasping him by the throat, pulled him off
his horse, hurled him to the ground and then sat upon his chest. Now,

348

History of Islam

as chance would have it, Shahryar's thumb went into Na'il's mouth
who bit it so severely that Shahryar was beside himself with pain.
Na'il taking advantage of the opportunity sprang up lightly and
sitting on the breast of his adversary, plunged his dagger deep into
the body of Shahryar ripping his stomach open. With the sight of the
killing of Shahryar, the Persian troops took to their heels. Shahryar
was clad in brilliant robes and armed with excellent weapons. Na'il
stripped him off all and placed them before Sa'd ~- In order to teach
his followers a lesson, Sa'd ~ ordered Na'il to put on the dress and
armor of the slain warrior. In pursuance of this command, Na'il
arrayed in the gaudy effects and splendid accouterment of Shahryar,
came before the public assembly and as the people saw him, the vivid
spectacle of the ironies of the world and the fickleness of fortunes
passed before their eyes.

The Fall of Bahurasir
Kutha was the historical place where Nimrod is said to have
imprisoned Abraham (Ibrahim~\). The dungeon was still preserved
as a relic. Sa'd ~ paid a visit to this sanctuary. At some distance from
Kutha was Bahurasir, a city in close proximity to the capital. A very
strong squad of the imperial guard and a huge garrison were kept in
Bahurasir to guard the seat of power. The Tigris alone intervened
between Bahurasir and Mada'in. Sa'd ~ advanced and laid siege to
Bahurasir. At last, the people of the city came out to face the Muslims
but it resulted in their death and destruction. Yezdgird took to flight
along with his treasure upon the fall of Bahurasir, his flight marked
that the Muslims were still not totally out of danger.

Horses across the River
Sa'd ~ was now in a rush to capture Mada'in. However, the Tigris
lay in the way. The fleeing Persians had demolished and broken all
the bridges. When Sa'd ~ arrived at the bank of the Tigris, he found
neither bridge nor boats. The next day Sa'd ~ mounted on his horse
and said after getting his troops ready, "Who among you is brave
enough to promise to save me from an enemy onslaught while I cross
the river?" Asim bin Amr~ came forward and offered his services.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

349

He sat on raised ground at the bank of Tigris with a squadron of six
hundred archers. Sa'd ~ recited:
"We seek the Help of Allah, entrust on Him, Allah is enough for
us and what an Excellent Supporter He is. There is no might
and strength but with Allah Who is High and Great."
He then charged right into the surging water of the Tigris. Others also
followed suit and rushed their horses into the river. The river was
deep and fast moving but the turbulent conditions could not affect the
resolute and undaunted spirits of the Muslim army. The waves
slammed furiously against the sides of the horses, but the horsemen
steered their course coolly and in perfect order. When the cavalry was
half way cross the river, the Persian archers began to shoot arrows at
the Muslim troops but in vain. The Muslim fighters crossed the river
by force and put the opposing force to death.

The Conquest of Mada'in
With the news of the crossing of the river by the Muslims, Yezdgird
took flight from Mada'in. The Muslim troops began to enter the city
from different directions. Sa'd ~ stepped in the White Palace (royal
palace) reciting the Verses:
"How many of gardens and springs do they left. And green crops
and goodly places. And comforts of life wherein they used to take
delight! Thus! And we made other people inherit them." (44:25-28)
He offered eight Rakat (units) of Salat-ul-Fath (victory prayer). In the
palace of Kisra (Chosroes), a pulpit was set up in place of the royal
throne and the Friday prayer was performed there. This was the first
Friday prayer that was performed in the Persian capital. Nothing of
the paintings, portraits and images were destroyed. The commander
of the Muslim army ordered that the treasures and curiosities of the
royal palaces should be brought and accumulated in one place. There
were vast riches including thousands of rare and priceless heirlooms
handed down and preserved from the Kayani dynasty until the time
of Nushirwan. They included the coats of mail and swords of the
monarchs of the Empires of China, the Emperor of Rome, Dahir Shah
of India, Bahram Gour, Nu'man bin Mundhir, Siyawash. The

350

History of Islam

poniards, swords, coats of mail and the helmets of Kisra, Hurmuz and
Firoz were also preserved in the royal museum. The Persians were
proud of their antique possessions. Sa'd ~ permitted Qa'qa' ~ to
choose for himself one of the swords. He was pleased to pick the
sword of Heraclius, the Roman monarch. Sa'd ~ gave him also the
coat of mail of Bahram Gour.
Sa'd ~ dispatched to the seat of the caliphate all the priceless
possessions and curiosities of the conquered palaces of Persia . The most
wonderful and exquisitely magnificent of all was a carpet which the
Persians called Bahar (Spring). After the season of ethereal mildness was
over, this carpet was used for the feast of wine. The carpet was provided
with all the effects of spring, which art and wealth could allow to be
imitated. In the center was a bucolic landscape bordered on all sides with
ornamental avenues around which trees and plants of various
descriptions were laden with buds and flowers and fruits. Everything
was worked in gold, silver and precious stones. The ground work was of
gold, the greenery of emerald, the borders of topaz, the trees of gold and
silver, the leaves of silk and the fruits were gems. Umar Farug ~
distributed the booty among the troops. With regard to the celebrated
carpet, the public opinion was that it should not be distributed but
preserved. Ali ~ persistently held aloof from this opinion and at his
instance this carpet also was distributed among the people in cut up
pieces. The piece Ali ~ shared was not so fine, however, he sold it for
thirty thousand dinars.

The Conquest of ]alula
When Mada'in fell to the Muslims, Yezdgird fled to Hulwan. Kharzad
bin Farkhzad, brother of Rustam Farkhzad, who was the commanderin-chief, displayed great skill in gathering a large army. He had a
moat built around the city and the fort. Gokhru (the many-pointed
thorns of murex) were scattered along the roadsides and pathways.
These military preparations were so massive that the Muslim camp
easily became aware of it. Sa'd ~ on receiving the news, wrote to
Umar ~ who replied that Hashim bin Utbah should be sent on this
expedition at the head of twelve thousand troops. The command of
the vanguard, the right wing, the left wing, and the rearguard should

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

351

be entrusted to Qa'qa', Ma'shar bin Malik, Amr bin Malik and Amr
bin Murrah respectively.
Hashim, marching from Mada'in, reached Jalula on the fourth day
and laid siege of the city. The siege continued for several months.
Occasionally the Persians would make a sudden attack on the
besiegers. In this manner many engagements were contested in which
the Persians invariably met with reverses. However, the city was
stocked with supplies and provisions of all sorts and their forces
numbered hundreds of thousands, they did not lose heart. One day
they rushed out recklessly but their forces were smashed leaving
about one hundred thousand troops dead and spoils worth thirty
million.
When Yezdgird learned the news of the disaster of Jalula, he left
Hulwan for Rey, placing Khusru Shanum, an officer of renown, in
charge of Hulwan with a few squadrons of cavalry. Qa'qa'~ was
dispatched to Hulwan at the head of some troops. A short but fierce
struggle ensued in which Khusru Shanum was routed.
While communicating the joyful tidings of the victory, Sa'd ~
dispatched a fifth portion of the booty to Al-Madinah. Ziyad~' the
messenger, described the battle with an eloquence which did him
immense credit. Umar ~ asked him to recount the events in the same
eloquent style before a public assembly. A public assembly was
accordingly convened and Ziyad ~ narrated the incidents of the
battle with a command of language and an eloquence that portrayed
the fray in its minutest detail. Afterwards Ziyad ~ brought forth the
spoils, which were stored in the courtyard of the mosque.
In the morning the mantle, which covered the goods was drawn
aside, heaps of precious stones were revealed. Tears ran down the
face of Umar ~ as the sight met his gaze. Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~
said to him, "Why do you weep instead of giving thanks?" Umar
Farug ~ replied, "Where riches appear, envy and jealousy are bound
to follow in their wake."
In response to Sa'd's seeking the Caliph's permission to march
towards Persia, he ordered him to take a rest for some days as the
Muslim soldiers were exhausted and needed it.

352

Syrian Engagements
The Fall of Hims
Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ marched to Hims and halted at DhulKala '. Hims is one of the important districts of Syria. In ancient times it
was greatly noted because of a temple dedicated to the sun. People
would come from distant places on pilgrimage to thi s templ e, and its
devotees prided themselves on this fact. After the fall of Damascus
and Jordan, three important cities remained to be conquered, which
would mean the subjugation of the whole of Syria. They were Hims,
Antakiyah (Antioch) and Jerusalem. When the Muslim army camped
at Dhul-Kala', H eraclius sent General Taudhar to engage them in the
battle. Another General Shams was also ordered to join the attack.
However, bo th of them were completely routed and Abu Ubaidah ~ .
killed Shams.
When the fleeing soldiers reached Hims, H eraclius left for Ar-Ruha.
Abu Ubaidah ~ marched on and besieged Hims. And, in spite of the
best efforts of Heraclius, the p eople of Hims remained without any
outside help. At last they yielded followed by Hamah, Al-Ladhiqiyah
and Salamyah .

Fall of Qinnasrin
Following the conquest of Salamyah, Khalid bin Walid ~, with the
permission of Abu Ubaidah ~ , march ed to Qinnasrin wh ere Minas,
only second to Heraclius in p osition, faced Khalid ~ but tasted
defeat after a fierce encounter. He took refuge in a citadel but Khalid
~ captured it after laying siege to it. Umar Faruq ~ grew happy and
added to his power and authority.

Conquest of Halab and Antakiyah
After finishing his task in Qinnasrin, Abu Ubaidah ~ marched to
Halab (Aleppo) where he came to know that the p eople of Qinnasrin
had risen in revolt. He at once dispatched a squadron to the spot of
the disturbance. When they were broug ht under siege, they expressed

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

353

their loyalty once again and saved themselves by paying a heavy
penalty. Abu Ubaidah Jj0 halted near Halab and sent in advance Iyad
bin Ghanam, the commanding officer of the vanguard. He marched to
Halab and laid a siege around the city, which surrendered to the
Muslims.
After Halab, Abu Ubaidah's next target was Antakiyah (Antioch),
which was the Asian capital of Heraclius. It was a fortified city with a
number of royal palaces. Thus the fleeing and fugitive Christians took
refuge in this city. When the Muslim troops arrived at Antakiyah, the
Christians came out to face the Muslims and were completely routed
and fled back to the city. When they came under siege, they earned
peace in return for paying the Jizyah.
News then came to the Muslim camp that Christian troops were
gathering in Mu'arrah Masrin, a place near Halab. Abu Ubaidah ~
marched to punish the antagonists and the result was a bloody fight
between the two forces which resulted in their earning peace like the
people of Halab. Antakiyah was reported to have again risen in revolt
but Iyad bin Ghanam and Habib bin Maslamah were already there to
crush it by force.
The repeated uprisings of the Christians in different regions were
putting the Muslim troops to great hardships. Abu Ubaidah ~
brought the situation to the knowledge of Umar Faruq .t",,k,. He ordered
Muslim squadrons to be deputed to all the trouble spots at the cost of
Bait-11/-Miil (public exchequer) . After the fall of Antakiyah, dozens of
surrounding villages and towns came on their own to the fold of the
Muslim forces.

Fall of Baghras, Mar 1 ash and Hadath
After winning decisive victories throughout Syria and deputing Muslim
commanding officers and administrators to all the cities under Muslims
possession, Abu Ubaidah ~ turned towards Palestine. A Muslim
detachment under the command of Maisarah bin Masruq was
dispatched to Baghras, a town in the neighborhood of Antakiyah
bordering on the frontier of Asia Minor. Many of the Arab Christians
such as the Ghassans, the Tanukh and the Iyyads were preparing at

354

History of Islam

this place to accompany the Romans to the Emperor Heraclius.
Maisarah bin Masruq attacked them and a fierce conflict took place. Abu
Ubaidah ~ dispatched reinforcements under Malik bin Ashtar Nakh'i.
With the arrival of fresh troops, the Christians fled in terror. Khalid
bin Walid ~ led a column against Mar'ash which capitulated on the
condition that the Christians should evacuate the city. In the same
way Habib bin Maslamah marched to Hadath (old name of Ararat
Mountain) and conquered it.

Conquest of Qaisariyah and Ajnadain
In course of time when Muslim troops were winning victories in
Antakiyah and its suburbs, Yazid bin Abu Sufyan, the governor of
Damascus sent his brother, Mu'awiyah bin Abu Sufyan towards
Qaisariyah (Caesarea or Kayseri) as per the Caliph's order. After a
heavy toll of eighty thousand Christians, the city fell to the Muslims.
Heraclius now ordered Artabun, a noted general, to gather troops in
Ajnadain. Artabun kept a huge army under his direct command and
two other detachments in Ramlah and Jerusalem. Well-equipped and
huge in number, the opponents of Islam were awaiting the arrival of
the Muslim force. Amr bin Al-As .;;. marched to Ajnadain to face
Artabun while he dispatched Alqamah bin Hakim Firasi and Masrur
bin Al-Akki to Jerusalem and Abu Ayub Al-Maliki to Ramlah with the
permission of Abu Ubaidah ~'"· A fierce battle was fought in Ajnadain.
It was a conflict similar to Yarmuk. Artabun could not muster courage
to face Amr bin Al-As .;;. and fled to Jerusalem and the city fell to the
Muslim forces.

Conquest of Jerusalem
After the flight of Artabw1 to Jerusalem, Amr bin Al-As ~ conquered
Ghazzah (Gaza), Sabastiyah, Nabulus (Nablus), Ludd, Amawas, Bait
Jibrin, and Yafa (Yafo). He then proceeded to Jerusalem and tightened the
siege. About the same time, Abu Ubaidah .f~ had proceeded to Palestine.
The news of his arrival disheartened the besieged Christians who were
defending themselves until then. They were left with no alternative but to
make peace negotiations. All of them knew about the readiness of the

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

355

Muslims to accept a peace proposal and their easy terms. However, the
Christians of Jerusalem put a novel condition on finalizing the peace
agreement. They wanted the Caliph of Islam to reach Jerusalem to
write down the peace document. Even though the fall of the city was
only a matter of time, Abu Ubaidah ~ was in favor of avoiding further
death and destruction, so he preferred peace to war. He wrote a letter
to the Caliph delineating the whole account of events with the request
that his arrival in Jerusalem could win for them the city without
shedding a drop of blood.
Umar Farug ~ convened a meeting of all the distinguished
Companions and consulted them. Uthman ~ declared that the
Christians had been struck with terror and lost heart and that if the
Caliph were to reject their request, they would be still more humiliated,
and consider that the Muslims regarded them with utter contempt,
they would lay down their arms unconditionally. Ali ~, however,
dissented from this view and gave the contrary opinion. Umar ~
shared the same opinion.

Umar Faruq's Journey to Palestine
On this historic mission to Jerusalem, a bag full of parched barley meal,
a camel, a slave, and a wooden cup were all the belongings of Umar
Farug ~' the Chief of the Muslims, when he left Al-Madinah, the
headquarters of Islam. Leaving Uthman ~ in charge of AI-Madinah,
he set out on the journey noted for its strain and stress.

It was a novel scenario of Islamic equality and human dignity that the
journey undertaken had at times the Caliph on the camel and the slave
walking along holding the halter of the camel and vice versa. It was the
journey of a magnificent and powerful Islamic ruler whose cavalry had
already trampled down palaces and crowns and thrones under the
hooves of its horses. It was Rajab 16 AH, when Mada'in and Antakiyah
(Antioch) had been conquered.
The commanders of the Muslim forces at Damascus and Jerusalem
were already informed about the movement of the Caliph of Islam.
Thus Yazid bin Abu Sufyan, Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah and Khalid bin
Walid i:,t, received the Caliph of Islam with exemplary honor. But when

356

History of Islam

Umar ~ saw them arrayed in brilliant dresses and imposing
appearance, he flew into a fit of rage at the sight of them that he
remarked: "Within the short span of two years have you fallen into
Persian habits?" But when the officers explained that they had their
weapons beneath the silken tunics and they had not lost their Arabian
character, the Caliph gained peace of heart.

A Peace Document for the Christians
The Chief of believers sojourned for a long while at Jabiah where
some of the nobles of the city proceeded to see him and the treaty was
drawn up there which is as follows:
"This is the peace document, which the Chief of the Muslims
has written for the people of Iylia'. Peace is given to one and all
in Iylia', peace of life and property, and peace to their church,
cross, sick, healthy and to the followers of all religions. Nobody
is allowed to reside in their churches nor will they be
demolished nor are their boundaries to be damaged nor their
cross to be desecrated nor their religion to be defiled. Moreover,
Jews will not be allowed to live with them in Iylia' . The people
of Iylia' are duty-bound to pay the Jizynh and turn out the
Greeks and Romans. And those among the Greeks and Romans
who will leave the city, their life and property will be provided
perfect safety until they reach a place of safety. If a Roman
prefers to live in Iylia', he is bound to give the Jizyah like the
rest of the citizens; if an Iylian intends to go with the Romans,
he will enjoy complete peace until he reaches a protected place.
Whatever this treaty contains is to be fulfilled by Allah, the
Caliphs of Islam and the entire Muslim community provided
the Iylians pay the ]izynh."
The elite of the Companions like Khalid bin Walid, Amr bin AI-As,
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and Mu'awiyah ,$, subscribed to it. The
people of Jerusalem paid the jizyah on the spot and opened the doors
of the city. The people of Ramlah also followed suit. Umar Faruq ~
entered Bait-ul-Maqdis (the Dome of the Rock) barefooted. First of all
he went to the Mosque of Al-Aqsa and approaching the Arch of
David he recited the Verse from the Qur'a n which speaks of the

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

357

Prophet David (Dawud ~I) as bowing down to Allah the Almighty
and then he prostrated himself in humble obeisance. He then visited
the church of the Christians and walked around the building for
sometime.

Fall of Takrit and ]azirah
Takrit was under a junior Persian commissioned officer. When he
heard of the fall of Mada'in, he drew the attention of the Romans to
the incident. The Romans also joined the cause easily because they
were also against the Muslim forces. Other Christian Arab tribes such
as Iyyad, Taghlib and Namir also followed suit. On the instruction of
Umar Faruq ~' Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ deputed Abdullah bin Al
Mu'tam to head the expedition. Abdullah marched on Takrit at the
head of five thousand troops and invaded the city. After a bloody
battle, the joint Roman and Persian forces were beaten. Most of the
Arabian clans embraced Islam.
The province of Jazirah fell between the frontiers of Syria and Iraq
and was at times annexed by both the Empires. Successive campaigns
and victories of the Muslim forces sent terror into the hearts of the
people of Jazirah. They wrote to Heraclius to send a force to guard the
eastern cities against the ensuing Muslim attack and they promised to
jointly rise to lend their help and support to Heraclius' troops.
Heraclius, thinking it to be a sign from the God, dispatched his troops
to the eastern cities of Syria. Assessing the crucial situation, Umar Faruq
~ instructed Sa'd ~ to keep a check on the forward movement of the
people of Jazirah and wrote Abu Ubaidah • to obstruct the march of
Heraclius' detachment towards Hims and Qinnasrin. Both the
commanders did their job appreciably well and Iyad bin Ghanam ~
captured the province of Jazirah after small skirmishes. This event took
place in 17 AH.

Return of lyyad Tribe
When Jazirah fell to the Muslims the Iyyad tribe, which confessed
Christianity, shifted to Heraclius' territory in self-exile and settled
there. Informed of the event, Umar Faruq ~ wrote to Heraclius:

358

History of Islam

"I have been informed that a tribe from among the Arabian tribes has
left our country to settle in your cities. If you refuse to turn them out
from your country, we shall send to you all the Christians inhabiting
our territory."
Immediately after the receipt of this warning from the Caliph of
Islam, Heraclius issued orders to banish the people of the Iyyad tribe
numbering four thousand in all. They went back to Syria and Jazirah
and settled there. Umar Farug ~ appointed Habib bin Maslamah and
Walid bin Uqbah administrators of Iraq-Ajam and Iraq-Arab
respectively. On the return of the Arabs, he wrote Walid bin Uqbah
not to force Islam on them and accept the fizyah from them if they so
desired. Granting no choice but Islam is a practice, which should be
adopted only in case of the Arab Peninsula and Yemen. However the
principle applies to the progeny of Muslim parents and they cannot
be converted to Christianity by force. Moreover, none should be held
back from coming to the fold of Islam.
Walid bin Uqbah made no delay in implementing the orders of Umar
Farug ~- A few days after, the Iyyad sent a deputation to AlMadinah with the request that no amount should be collected from
them in the name of Jizyah. Umar Farug~ issued orders to collect
from them double the amount in the name of Sadqah (charity) in place
of Jizyah (tax), which the Iyyad accepted happily. After some days, the
tribe lodged a complaint against Walid bin Uqbah. The Caliph took
prompt action and appointed Furat bin Haiyan and Hind bin Amr AlJamali to do the job and deposed Walid bin Uqbah without delay.

Deposition of Khalid bin Walid •
People are generally mistaken about the event of the deposition of Khalid
bin Walid ~ - They subscribe to the misconception that Umar Farug ~
had deposed Khalid bin Walid ~ soon with his installation as the Caliph
of Islam. The fact is that Umar ~ did not deposed him during the earlier
period of his Caliphate, he had only curtailed his position by reducing
him to a deputy commander from commander-in-chief of the Muslim
army. Now he had to first consult and receive permission from Abu
Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ before any action, so his leading of Muslim
forces through dangerous adventures came to an end.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

359

The incident of Khalid's deposition occurred in the last months of 17
AH. Umar Faruq ~ used to keep himself informed of the activities of
every commander, general, officer and governor. Even though every
governor or commander had to inform the Caliph with the account of
matters and affairs of all kinds, he also had correspondents in every
city and military wing who wrote to him about events and incidents
that would take place in their areas of activity.
Thus a correspondent of the Caliph once informed him that on his
return to Syria after the fall of Jazirah, Khalid bin Walid • had
brought with him immense riches and property and granted ten
thousand dirhams to Ash'ath bin Qais, a poet, in return for writing an
ode for him. Umar • addressed a letter to Abu Ubaidah bin AlJarrah • instructing him: "Ask Khalid in the presence of an audience
whether he has made the present in question out of his own purse or
from the public treasury. In case he has given it from his own purse, it
is a sheer extravagance; and if he has given it from the public
treasury, he has committed an offence of criminal breach of trust; and
in either case he deserves to be deposed. Let his neck be tied with his
own turban. But, if he admits his fault then he is to be forgiven."
Accordingly, he was called before a public gathering. The Caliph's
messenger inquired of him, "Wherefrom did you make this present?"
Khalid bin Walid • kept silent and held back from confessing his
fault. Thus the messenger found himself under compulsion to remove
his turban and tie his neck with it. On asking again, Khalid •
revealed that he had given the reward to Ash'ath from his own
possessions, not from the public treasury. Hearing this the messenger
untied his neck and reported the matter to the Caliph who called
Khalid • to Al-Madinah for an explanation.
Khalid bin Walid • said to the Caliph: "Umar! By Allah, you are not
doing justice to me." Umar • said to him, "Wherefrom have you
collected so much wealth and how did you give away such a
substantial amount to a poet for a reward?" Khalid• said, "I had
given it from my share of booty." Khalid• further said, "Well, I will
deposit with the public treasury any amount I have exceeding sixty
thousand." Thus, after checking the whole account, twenty thousand
dirhams exceeded the stipulated amount, which was immediately

360

History of Islam

deposired with the public treasury and the matter w as cleared up in good
faith from both sides. It was a weakness with Khalid bin Walid ~ that he
spent lavishly without submitting the accounts to the financial
authorities. Hence, it was purely and totally in the interest of fair and
exemplary administration that some curb was put on Khalid bin Walid's
way of dealing with public finance. And the step taken by the Caliph was
just a warning and nothing else.

Basrah and Kufah
From the reports of the military commanders and the soldiers
returning from Iraq, Umar Farug ~ gathered that the climate of lraq
did not suit them. H e issued orders tha t cantonments for the Arabian
forces should be set up at places where they could enjoy climate
similar to that of Arabia so that the Arabian soldiers could, after
finishing their job, take rest therein.
One cantonment was set up near the Tigris with thatched roofs. While
going on a campaign, they would set the thatch on fire and repaired it
again on their return. Umar Farug ~ constructed some houses in Basrah
in 17 AH, and approved a new cantonment for Kufah. With the
construction of houses, both these places began to be rapidly populated
because of the healthy climate of these regions. And within a short
period, both the cities came to be known as the centers of Muslim power.

Conquest of Ahwiz, and Hurmuzan accepts Islam
Running away from the battle of Qadisiyah, the well-known Persian
commander, Hurmuzan took refuge in Khuzestan, the capital of
Ahwaz province and devoted himself wholeheartedly to collecting
soldiers by capturing the surrounding cities. Muslim forces emerged
from the cantonments of Kufah and Basrah and charged at Ahwaz
which fell to them. Hurmuzan earned peace from the Muslims in
return for paying the Jizyah. After a few days, Hurmuzan rose in
revolt against the Muslims but was again beaten thoroughly. He again
sought peace for Jizyah and it was granted. Meanwhile news came that
Yezdgird, the Persian monarch, was collecting a huge army to attack the
Muslims.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

361

On receiving this disturbing news, Umar Farug ~ immediately wrote
Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ to deploy Islamic squadrons at all the
avenues of access. As a precautionary measure, a squadron was also
sent to take care of th e activities of Hurmuzan. Since he was counting
on Yezdgird, he rose against the Muslim force with a big army and
the result was a complete rout. Hurmuzan fled to Tustar and devoted
himself again to making preparations for battling with the Muslims.
When Umar Farug ~ heard of this, he sent Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ as
the Commander of the army stationed at Basrah.
Abu Musa ~ advanced towards Tustar and after a number of
encounters, Hurmuzan took shelter in his fort for a d efensive battle.
However, he was greeted by an ignominious d efeat and the city fell to
the Muslims. The fort was about to fall when Hurmuzan sent a
petition to Abu Musa ~ mentioning that he was ready to surrender
on the sole condition that he be dispatched to Umar Farug~ and let
him decide about him (Hurmuzan). His petition was granted and he
was sent to Al-Madinah in the company of Anas bin Malik and Ahnaf
bin Qais ~ - Reaching the area bordering Al-Madinah, he put on
costly and glamorous garments and his glittering crown.
Umar Farug ~ thanked Allah when he noticed such a general as a
ca ptive. The Caliph then said to him, "You have backed out of your
promise more than once, what punishment do you deserve then? And
what do you want to say in self-defense?" Hurmuzan said, "I am
afraid you will slay me before hearing my excuse." The Caliph said,
"Fear not, your excuse will be definitely heard." Hurmuzan then
asked for some drinking water. He then took the cup of water in his
hand and said, "I am afraid you will kill me while I am drinking this
water." Umar Farug ~ said, "Fear not in the least, you will be put to
no harm unless you have drunk this cup of water." Hearing this
Hurmuzan kept the cup back and said, "I won't drink, and you
cannot kill me as per your promise."

Graceful Treatment of Umar ~:
Hearing this, Umar Farug ~ angrily said, "You tell a lie, I have not
given you peace." Thereupon Anas bin Malik ~ intervened and said,
"O Chief of the believers, he tells the truth. You have just promised

362

History of Islam

him that he will not be harmed until he has drunk the cup of water
and given his account." Hearing this Umar Faruq ~ was left wonderstruck and said addressing Hurmuzan, "You have deceived me but I
will not do the same. It is better for you to convert to Islam."
Hurmuzan accepted Islam at once. Umar Faruq ~ grew very happy.
He gave Hurmuzan a place in Al-Madinah to live in and sanctioned
for him an annual grant of two thousand dinars. He was also
consulted during the campaigns of Persia.
Umar Faruq ~ then said to Anas bin Malik and Ahnaf bin Qais ~,
"You people perhaps fail to treat your Dhimmi (non-Muslim citizens
of an Islamic state) well. And the result is their uprisings time and
again." They submitted, "O Chief of the believers, we make it a point
to treat them extremely well and hold them in high regard. However,
they rise against us again and again because you have held us back
from going ahead. Yezdgird, the Persian Emperor is there in his cities
and while he is safe and sound, the Persians will never sit back and
abandon their fighting." The Caliph agreed and issued immediate
orders for the Muslim forces to march ahead.

The Conquest of Egypt
During Umar Faruq's stay in Jerusalem, Amr bin Al-As ~ had
obtained his consent for launching an attack on Egypt. Amr ~
marched to Egypt at the head of four thousand troops. The Caliph of
Islam put before Muqauqis, the king of Egypt, three conditions: Islam
or Jizyah or battle, in his dispatch from Al-Madinah. The Roman
general Artabun along with his entire army was in Egypt at that time.
First Artabun moved forward and then fled the battlefield after
experiencing a decisive defeat.
Afterwards the Muslim army advanced further and laid siege around
Ainu Shams and from there dispatched two squadrons to besiege
Farama and Alexandria (Iskandariyah). Both the cities fell to the
Muslim troops. Amr bin As~ then sent Zubair bin Al-Awwam ~ to
Fustat as a commander, he conquered the fortified citadel after a
heavy encounter. Amr bin Al-As~ attacked Alexandria, which fell
after a siege of three months.

The Battle of Nahawand
After the conquest of Mada'in and Jalula, Yezdgird shifted to Rey and
then to Isfahan. When Ahwaz fell to the Muslims, he fled to Marwin
Khurasan located in eastern Persia. He built a fire temple there and
was satisfied that the Arabs would not make any advancement. He
became full of rage after Ahwaz was destroyed, and Hurmuzan was
captured and taken to Al-Madinah. He again started huge military
preparations for beating the Muslims and wrote letters to the notables
from the surrounding areas putting them to shame over the
successive Muslim victories.
These efforts of Yezdgird bore fruit and Tabaristan, Jurjan, Khurasan,
Isfahan, Hamadan, and Sindh rose against the Muslims in great
fervor. Fighters from various regions rushed to join Yezdgird. He put
Firoz or Mardan Shah as a commander of a one-hundred-and-fiftythousand-man army and dispatched it to Nahawand. On receiving
this news, Umar Faruq ~ decid ed to lead the army himself.
However, Ali, Uthman and Talhah ~~ differed with his decision and
the Caliph honored their opinion.
He then nominated Nu'man bin Muqarrin ~ as commander and
instructed him to go and halt at a stream near Kufah. At that time Sa'd
bin Abu Waqqas ~ was in Al-Madinah at the invitation of the
Caliph. The Caliph wrote to Abdullah bin Abdullah bin Utban, the
deputy of Sa'd ~ to dispatch forces from Kufah under the command
of Nu'man bin Muqarrin ~- The order was immediately
implemented. The Caliph also instructed the Muslim troops stationed
in Ahwaz to blockade Persia and Isfahan so that the people of
Nahawand could not get any help from Persia .
When troops from other corners gathered together Nu'man bin
Muqarrin ~ put his brother Nu'aim bin Muqarrin at the vanguard,
gave the right flank to Hudhaifah bin Yaman ~' left flank to Suwaid
bin Muqarrin, the infantry to Qa'qa' and rearguard to Mujashi ' bin
Mas'ud. The total number of Muslim troops reached thirty thousand.
The army marched from Kufah and halted at a place nine miles from
its destination. The Persian army also came out on the field .

364

History of Islam

The battle started on Wednesday and continued until Thursday but
without any decision. On Friday, the Persians moved back to the city
and fortified areas. Since they had strewn Gokhru (iron-thorns) around
the entire city obstructing the movement of the Muslim army towards
the ramparts of the city, while the Persians could charge at the
Muslim troops at anytime. In the wake of the new developments,
Nu'man summoned the commanders to his camp and sought their
opinion about dealing with the situation. Tulaihah bin Khuwailid
gave his opinion that the Muslim army, alert and ready, should make
a retreat about six to seven miles from the city. And as a next step,
Qa'qa' be asked to charge at them with a column. The suggestion was
unanimously agreed upon.
When the Persians noticed a small force before them, they became
overjoyed and came out to attack it in full force. The Muslim column,
according to plan, kept gradually moving back, while the Persians
continued their pressure on the Muslims and moved ahead. They
were now at a long distance from their trenches and defensive devices
and were caught unaware by the large and fresh Muslim army lying
in wait for their arrival. Nu'man bin Muqarrin ~ along with others
launched a fierce attack on the Persians with the loud cry of Allahu
Akbar (Allah is the Most Great). The enemy force was thoroughly
outwitted, they fled the field leaving a large number of soldiers dead
and injured.
During the rage and fury of the killing of the Persians, Nu'man bin
Muqarrin ~ fell down from his horse badly exhausted and injured
and was martyred. His brother Nu'man bin Muqarrin appeared on
the scene and put on his dress and took the standard of Nu'man and
the Muslim army remained unaware until the end of the battle about
the martyrdom of their commander. The fleeing Persian soldiers were
entrapped by the Gokhru spread by themselves, which took a toll in
thousands. The Persian commander and other commanding officers
escaped to Hamadan, but Nu'man and Qa'qa' conquered Hamadan
too. Hudhaifah bin Yaman ~ was then appointed commander of the
Muslim army, and in that capacity he distributed the spoils of war in
Nahawand and put out the fire temple. Its high priest waited upon
Hudhaifah ~ and offered to put him in possession of priceless

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

365

treasures if his own life and property were spared. Hudhaifah • was
very willing to accede to this proposal, the priest accordingly brought
and placed before him precious stones of the rarest value from the
royal teasure kept with himfor emergencies. Hudhaifah •
distributed the spoils of war among the troops and dispatched onefifth, together with the precious stones to the Caliph.
For a couple of days the Caliph had received no news from the seat of
war and was worried. However, he grew overjoyed at the arrival of
the messenger, Sa'ib bin Al-Agra' with the tidings of the victory and
one-fifth of the booty together with the precious stones. Umar Farug
• deposited the precious stones with the public treasury and sent
Sa'ib back. Sa'ib had hardly stepped in Kufah when a messenger of
the Caliph came chasing him and brought him back to Al-Madinah.
Umar Farug •
revealed, "I had a dream that the angels were
threatening me with torment of Fire for depositing the gems and
jewels in the public treasury. So I will never preserve them in the
public treasury. Take these with you and distribute among the troops
their price after selling them all." When Sa'ib sold those jewels to Amr
bin Huraith Makhzumi in Kufah, they fetched two hundred thousand
dirhams which were distributed among the Muslim troops. Umar
Fa.rug's murderer, Abu Lulu was a citizen of Nahawand and was
captured in the same battle.

General Conquest of Persia
The fall of Nahawand was followed by that of Hamadan but the latter
rose in revolt after only a few days. Being fed up with the continual
revolts of the Persian regions, Umar Farug. later ordered a general
attack.
Isfahan forms the first link in a chain of conquests. Nu'aim bin
Muqarrin conquered Rey and Azerbaijan after a bloody battle.
Suwaid bin Muqarrin, the brother of Nu'aim bin Muqarrin won
Qumis. Isphandiyar, the brother of Rustam, was held by Utbah and
released on the promise of paying the Jizyah. He then conquered
Jurjan and then the entire province of Tabaristan fell to the Muslims.
Bukair then conquered Armenia. Baida and Khazar were conquered
by Abdur-Rahman bin Rabi'ah.

366

History of Islam

Asim bin Umar ~ conquered the province of Seistan and Suhail bin
Adi took Kirman. Hakam bin Amr Taghlabi ~ won victory in
Makran, (Baluchistan) and after a severely contested conflict Rasal,
the king of Makran was defeated . Hakam bin Amr's dispatch to the
Caliph communicating the news of the victory also was accompanied
by a few elephants, which were captured in the spoils. Umar Farug~
inquired from Sahar Abdi ~, the messenger, about the particulars of
Makran and then issued an order instructing Hakam bin Amr~ to
stop his forward advances.
It has already been mentioned that Yezdgird was stationed in
Khurasan and a full-scale battle was anticipated, Umar Farug ~
enforced Ahnaf bin Qais ~ by several squadrons headed by seasoned
and brave commanders. When these fresh reinforcements joined
Ahnaf ~' he made Balkh the target of a severe attack. Yezdgird
tasted ruinous defeat and fled to Turkistan. Ahnaf ~ captured all of
Khurasan and made Marwarod the seat of power. Umar Farug~
praised Ahnaf ~ for his high spirits and deeds of valor but as to his
seeking permission for further advancemeirt, the Caliph wrote back,
"Would that a river of fire intervened between us and Khurasan." He
meant that expansionist policy was not a good thing. So, he instructed
Ahnaf ~ to stop where he was and advance no further.

When Yezdgird reached Farghana, Khaqan, the Emperor of China
held him in high esteem and accompanied Yezdgird towards
Khurasan at the head of a huge army. Khaqan invaded Marwarod,
while Yezdgird charged at Marw-Shahjahan. Khaqan was defeated in
his conflict with Ahnaf bin Qais ~ and he fled back to Farghana after
losing some of his renowned men in the fray. With the flight of
Khaqan, Yezdgird raised the siege of Marw-Shahjahan and despairing
of victory, he gathered all his treasure and resolved to proceed to
Turkistan. Noticing that luck was not in favor of Yezdgird, his
courtiers turned against him and despoiled him of all his vast riches.
Shorn of his entire splendor, Yezdgird fled to Khaqan and lived at
Farghana, the Khaqan's capital. When Umar Farug~ heard of the
victory, he assembled all the citizens of Al-Madinah to the Prophet's
Mosque and gave them the glad tidings in a powerful oration, the gist
of which is given below:

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

367

"The empire of the Magians has become extinct this day and
from now on they will not possess a span of land to injure the
Muslims in any way. Allah the Almighty has made you master
of the Magians, their country, their riches and their properties
in order to test your deeds and actions. Muslims do keep in
mind not to admit any change in your way of life otherwise,
Allah the Almighty will take the sovereign power from you and
give it to others."
A few days after this, the sad event of the martyrdom of Umar Faruq
~ took place in Al-Madinah.

Famine and Plague
During the last days of 17 AH, plague broke out in Iraq, Syria and
Egypt and became intense in the early days of 18 AH. Along with this,
famine also overtook the Arabian territory. Scarcity of food made life
miserable. Umar Faruq ~ rose to the occasion with might and main
and showed amazing and exemplary readiness, courage and skill in
handling the situation. He immediately issued a volley of letters to the
governors to rush food grains to the people of Al-Madinah. In response
to this order, Amr bin Al-As~ dispatched from Egypt twenty ships
laden with food grains, and Umar Faruq ~ himself proceeded to the
port to take the delivery and preserve the goods in a protected
warehouse. He then prepared a list of the needy and distributed among
them food grain according to their need. He vowed not to use butter
and milk while the people were under the stress of famine.
Hearing the news of plague spreading in Syria, Umar Faruq ~
himself came out and proceeded towards the Islamic army there. He
had been at Sargh when Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~ and other
commanders and military officers received him with honor. Some of
the Companions requested him not to move any further. AbdurRahman bin Auf ~' said that he had heard the Prophet~ to have
said, "Go not to the place where an epidemic has broken out, and
retreat not from the place already in the grip of an epidemic." Hearing
this Hadith, Umar Faruq ~ came back to Al-Madinah, instructing the
authorities to handle the situation with utmost care and caution. Thus
they sprang into action and took all the precautionary measures at

368

History of Islam

their command. Abu Ubaidah ~ was then stationed in a low-lying
area but as per the order of Umar ~, carried his army to Jabiah,
which had a healthier climate.
However, Abu Ubaidah ~ fell victim to the plague at Jabiah and
appointed Mu'adh bin Jabal ~ commander in his place, and
succumbed to the disease. Mu'adh bin Jabal ~ also did not live long
and the fatal disease took a toll of Mu'adh ~' and his son was cut
down in the prime of his life. Mu'adh appointed Amr bin Al-As ~
his successor before his final departure. Amr bin Al-As~ climbed a
high mountain along with his soldiers and encamped in small groups.
After sometime the rage of the epidemic receded. However, this
epidemic took a heavy toll of life and some of the distinguished
personages of Islam were removed from the scene. As a result of this,
the flood of victories came to a sudden halt.
The same year, 18 AH, the Caliph appointed Shuraih bin Harith Kindi
and Ka'b bin Suwr Azdi judges (Qadi) of Kufah and Basrah
respectively. Umar Faruq ~ built houses and dug wells between
Makkah and Al-Madinah for the welfare of the public, he extended
the courtyard of the Ka'bah by purchasing adjoining houses.

The Conquests of Umar Faruq ~
The conquests cited above include Persia, Iraq, Jazirah, Khurasan,
Baluchistan, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Armenia. And the conquests,
which were made during the decade long Faruqi Caliphate were not
ordinary. The provinces carved by Umar Faruq ~ himself in 22 AH,
were Makkah, AI-Madinah, Syria, Jazirah, Basrah, Kufah, Egypt,
Palestine, Khurasan, Azerbaijan and Persia. Some of them were equal
to two provinces in area with two centers of power and separate
governors and their administrations.

Martyrdom of Umar Faruq ~
There was a Persian origin Christian slave named Firoz in AlMadinah whose patronymic (literally 'father of' and then usually 'the
name of the first born son' ) was Abu Lulu. One day he came across
Umar ~ in the marketplace and complained that his master

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

369

Mughirah bin Shu 'bah had imposed upon him a very heavy tax and
begged the Caliph to prevail upon his master to reduce the same. Umar
~ asked him the amou nt of the tax. He replied that it was two dirhams
per day. The Caliph then asked him his trade. "I work as a carpenter, a
painter and an ironsmith," he replied. The Caliph said, "The amount is
not that much considering these lucrative vocations." This decision did
not suit Firoz and he grew displeased. Umar Faruq ~ then said to him
that he had heard that he (Firoz) could make windmills, and would he
make one for him. "Very well, I shall make for you such a mill whose
sound will be heard by the west and the east."
The next day when the people assembled in the mosque to perform
the morning prayer, Firoz came into the mosque armed with a
poisonous dagger. As the ranks of the congregation were put straight
and in order, and Umar ~ came up and took his position at the head
of the ranks to lead the prayer, Firoz suddenly rushed from the first
rank and struck Umar ~ six consecutive blows, one of which fell
below his navel. Umar ~ instantly caught hold of Abdur-Rahman
bin Auf ~' and ordered him to take his place and he, unable to stand
the wounds, fell d own unconscious on the floor. Abdur-Rahman bin
Auf ~ led the prayer while Umar ~ lay stabbed and mangled.
Abu Lulu wounded other persons also besides putting Kulaib bin AlBukair ~ to martyrdom. At last he was arrested but committed
suicide simultaneously. After performing the Fajr prayer, they carried
Umar ~ home. "Who is my assassin?" were the first words, which
escaped Umar's lips after regaining consciousness. "Abu Lulu,"
replied the people. "Praised be to All ah that I am not killed by a man
who called himself a Muslim or performed even a single prostration
before Allah," Umar ~ said with a sense of satisfaction.
A physician was sent for, who administered to him a date cordial and
milk. Both these, however, gushed forth from the wounds whereupon
the people realized that he would not survive. They accordingly
asked him to nominate his successor as Abu Bakr~ had done. He
sent for Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas, Zubair bin
Awwam, Talhah, Ali, and Othman bin Affan ,$,. Talhah ~ was
somewhere outside Al-Madinah. Umar Faruq ~ said addressing
those five persons: "Keep waiting for Talhah for three days: If he

370

History of Islam

returns within this period, he is included in the panel otherwise you
should choose your caliph from among yourselves." Thereafter he
called his son, Abdullah bin Umar ~ and said, "If they are divided in
their choice for the caliph, you should side with the majority and if
the two groups show equal number, you join the group which has
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf on its side."
He then called Abu Talhah Ansari and Miqdad bin Aswad ~ and
ordered them to be at the door while the panel was in session and let
nobody in until the deliberations were over. Following this he said
addressing the panel members, "I leave my will for the person who is
chosen to the post of the caliph that he should take particular care of
the rights of the Ansar, for they are those who lent their support to the
Prophet ~' let the Muhajirin stay in their houses. The Ansar happen to be
your benefactors and so they deserve your obligation. You should
mostly overlook their faults and ignore their mistakes. Anybody being
elected as caliph, should pay attention to the Muhajirin too, for they are
the root of Islam. Fulfill the responsibilities regarding the Dhimmi and
any promise made to the Dhimmi must be honored, their enemies should
be kept away and they should never be asked to do anything beyond
their power."
Having done with public affairs, Umar ~ turned attention towards
his private concerns. He asked his son Abdullah~ to go to Aishah
~ and tell her that he begged permission from her to be buried by the
side of the Prophet~- Abdullah~ accordingly waited upon Aishah
~ whom he found weeping. He conveyed to her the greetings and
the message of Umar ~- She said, "I had a mind to reserve this place
for myself but today I will accord Umar precedence over myself."
Abdullah ~ now hastened back to his father who eagerly inquired:
"What news bring you to me, 0 my son?" "That which will give you
satisfaction," rejoined Abdullah ~ - "It was the greatest wish of my
life," said Umar ~, the Caliph of Islam and Chief of the believers.
He was wounded on Wednesday, Dhul-Hijjah 27, 23 AH, and died
and was buried on Muharram 1, 24 AH. His tenure as caliph was ten
and a half years. Suhaib ~ led his funeral prayer. Ali, Zubair,
Uthman Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and Abdullah bin Umar $, lowered
his body into the grave and performed the burial service.

Wives and Children
The first wife he married in his state of Ignorance was Zainab,
daughter of Maz'un bin Habib bin Wahb bin Hudafah bin Jumh who
gave birth to Abdullah, Abdur-Rahman (elder) and Hafsah. Zainab ~
embraced Islam in Makkah and died in the same city. She was the
sister of Uthman bin Maz'un ~ who was one of the earliest Muslims
and was the fourteenth to embrace Islam.
His second wife, Mulaikah, daughter of Jarwal Khuza 'i, was also
married in the state of Ignorance, who gave birth to Ubaidullah . Since
she refused to accept Islam, she was divorced in 6 AH. His third wife
was Qaribah, daughter of Abu Umayyah Makhzumi who was also
married in the state of Ignorance and was divorced in 6 AH, after the
conclusion of the Truce of Hudaibiah because of her rejection of Islam.
His fourth marriage was solemnized with Umm Hakim, the daughter
of Al-Harith bin Hisham Makhzumi who gave him Fatimah and his
fifth wife was Jamilah, the daughter of A.sim bin Thabit bin Abu Aflah
Ausi Ansari to whom A.sim was born, but she too was divorced for
certain reasons.
His six th marriage was performed with Umm Kulthum ~, the
daughter of Ali ~ who gave birth to Ruqayyah and Zaid. Among the
children of Umar Faruq ~' Hafsah and Abdullah were much
renowned. Hafsah ~ was married to the Prophet ~ and Abdullah bin
Umar ~ accompanied the Prophet ~ in all the battles. Umar ,$ also
had other wives, namely A.tikah, the daughter of Zaid bin Amr bin
Nufail. A.tikah was the cousin of Umar ,$. Fukaihah Yamenia is also
reckoned among the wives of Umar ~- Some people have written
that she was his slave-girl who gave birth to Abdur-Rahman (the
middle one).

Accomplished Firsts by Umar Faruq ~
Umar Faruq ~ invented and enforced many things in the sphere of
financial, political, administrative and social spheres, which are
known as accomplishments first instituted by him. Some of them are
mentioned below:

372

History of Islam

He set up a formal Bait-ul-Mnl or public treasury and introduced the
Hijri calendar, he adopted the appellation of Amir-ul-Mo'minin (Chief
of the believers), he established a regular department for the military
and a separate department for financial affairs and fixed the salaries
for men in voluntary services. He also introduced the practice of
measuring the land and keeping its record, adopted a census system,
he had canals dug and populated cities like Kufah, Basrah, Jizah,
Fustat (Cairo) and delineated provinces out of the occupied territories.
He was first to allow rival country's traders to come to Muslim
territories for the purpose of business. He was also the first to make
use of the whip for corporal punishment and set up a prison and
police department. He introduced a system of collecting direct
information concerning states and conditions of the masses, he
established a secret intelligence service, he had wells bored, built
houses and fixed a daily allowance for the destitute among the
Christians and the Jews. Moreover, it was from his original planning
to make arrangements for congregational Tarawih prayers, he levied
Zakat on horses for trading purposes and started four Takbir for the
funeral prayer.

Various Conditions and Special Features
Umar Farug ~ lived on simple and coarse food. Messengers from
outside Al-Madinah stayed with the Caliph and dined with him as his
guest. They felt uneasy for they were not in the habit of living on such
simple foods. His dress was also simple to the extreme. He would
most often wear clothes with a number of patches. At times he had
leather patches on his cotton shirts. On one occasion he remained in
his home, while the people waited for him outside. On his coming out
they understood that he had no clothes to wear. He had washed the
one outfit he possessed and until it dried, he could not come out.
After Hijrah (migrationt he lived in a village two to three miles away
from AI-Madinah. After becoming caliph, he shifted to Al-Madinah
and settled in a house located near the Prophet's Mosque between
Bab-us-Salam and Bab-ur-Rahmah. He was in debt at the time of his
death. He ordered the debt to be paid by selling his residential house.
Mu'awiyah ~ purchased the house and the debt was thus settled.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

373

He once said in his address: "People! There was a time when I used to
bring water for others and in return for that they gave me dates to live
on." When the people said what was the need of narrating such
things. He replied, "I felt a shade of pride over myself and it was the
most suitable cure." He so often made journeys between Al-Madinah
and Makkah but never took with him a tent or any type of shelter.
When he needed rest, he would spread a mantle under an acacia tree
and lay on it. When overcome by sleep, he used to collect pebbles and
sand to make a pillow to put his head on. He fixed payments from the
public treasury for the wives of the Prophet ~ , the Companions of
Badr, those who took the pledge of Rid wan and all the elite and
distinguished Companions. When he fixed the payment for Usamah
more than his son, Abdullah~ raised an objection. He then said to his
son, "The Prophet ~ loved Usamah more than you and his father
more than your father."
Umar Fa.rug's fellows and advisors were all religious scholars and
there was no consideration for age. He held them in high esteem.
Knowledge of men and their mettle was among his traits. He was also
fully aware of special traits in various Companions and earned their
services accordingly. While choosing persons to shoulder the
responsibilities of governing, commanding, administrating, and other
important posts, he was never influenced by mere piety and divinity
but he based his choice on skill and suitability.
During his decade long caliphate, hundreds of battles were fought in
Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Khurasan. He did not take part in
any of these battles, nevertheless the strategies were decided and the
necessary arrangements were made by him. All the battles were
fought under the instructions of Umar Farug ~ and no one can point
out any flaw in any of his judgement or instruction. He had instructed
all provincial governors that no soldier should be kept from going
home for more than four months in succession.
He was once advised to use honey to cure some disease, but he had
no honey with him nor could any be had from anywhere else.
However, it was stocked in the public treasury. The people advised
him to take it from there. He argued that it was the property of the
people and so he could not take it without their permission.

374

History of Islam

One day he washed the wounds of the camels and said that he was
afraid of being questioned about their condition on the Day of
Judgment. He once asked Salman ~ . whether he was a king or a
caliph. He replied that if he collected from someone a dirham, or more
or less than that, and spent it unnecessc1 rily, he was il king otherwise,
he was a caliph.
Even after being the Caliph for a long time, he had taken nothing
from the public treasury, with the result he ca me und er the stress of
starvation . Finding no way out he assembled the people in the
Prophet's Mosque and said that since he remai ned preoccupied with
th e affairs of the caliphate, he found no time to look after his personal
need s. So, he requested them to fix som ething from the public
treasury. Ali ~ said that he should get only two meals per day from
the public treasury, which he accepted without question.
Abdullah bin Umar ~ said, " It never happened that Umar fell in
anger and his fury was not subsided at the mention of Allah's Name
or on making him afraid of Allah or on reci ting any Verse of the
Qur'an." Bilal ~ once asked Aslam ~ about Umar ~ and he
replied, "He is, undoubtedly, the best of all but when he grows angry,
it is nothing short of a calamity." Bilal ~ said, "Why don' t you recite
any Verse a t that time and his anger will totally subside?"
Umar Faruq ~ once sent Sariyah at the head of a military
d etachment. Some time after that durin g a public address he cried, "O
Sariya h! Go to the mountain side." After sometime a messenger ca me
to Al-Madinah from the place of battle and gave an account of the
battle. During his narration he said, "We were about to be defea ted
w hen we heard someone calling out thrice, 'O Sariyah! Go to the
mountain side.' Beca use of this, our enemy was defeated."
When those words were uttered by Umar Faruq ~ in his Friday
address, some people among the audience had sa id, "You are giving
your call to Sariyah here while he is engaged in fighting with the
disbelievers in Nahawand." Whereupon he had said, " It was such a
scene at that time tha t the Muslims appeared engaged in fighting and
it was essen tial for them to look towards the mountain. Thus came out
from my tongue those word s." When the messenger of Sariyah came

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

375

to Al-Madinah with his letter, the event wa s mentioned therein
referring to the day and time exactly, which corresponded to the date
and time of Umar's address.
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ once said to him: "They fear you so much
that they can't look toward s you nor can they move their lips." Umar
Faruq ~ replied , " By Allah, I fear them more than they fear me."
Umar Faruq ~ had issued orders to the governors to perform the

Hajj during the Hajj season and he himself used to be present there on
those occasions. The wisdom behind such a practice was tha t he
wanted to give an opportunity to everyone to meet him and place
before him anything against their governors and they (the governors)
should be read y to give an ex planation for their behavior. As a result
of this, the governors kept alert lest they were taken to task before the
public for their actions. Thus he laid the foundation of a true
democracy and real equality.

The Summary of Conquests
The area of the conquests of Umar Faruq ~ is said to ha ve spread
over 22.5 hundred thousand square miles. This was the result of
victories won by a w retched and small people against the mig hty
empires of Persia and Rome.
The Roman Empire had in its fold the Balkan Peninsula, Asia Minor,
Sy,ria, Palestine, Egypt, and Sudan. Some years back the Persian
Empire had gained such a strength tha t it invaded victo riously in the
Syrian region reaching the w a ters and up to Egypt after defeating the
Roman Empire. The Persians had no less countries und er their rule
than the Romans. Those two magnificent empires ruled over the
Western and the Eastern world and there was no third force to make a
challenge to their mig ht.
Christian and non-Muslim historians account for the rapid and vast
Muslim conquests by the fact that both the Roman and Persian
Empires were at that time in d ecay, with the result the Muslims had
an opportunity to conquer bo th these powers. But, while giving
reasons for the fall of both these mighty Empires, they forget to tell
about the position of the Muslim State as compared to the giants of

376

History of Islam

the East and the West in decay. Moreover, when they came in conflict
with the Muslim forces, their mutual enmity was not at its peak. Thus
each of them was in a position to mobilize massive forces against the
numerically weak Muslim power.
Besides, the single Muslim force had to face the two giants
simultaneously, both of them were not only mighty but also the most
civilized and advanced in all respects. Both of them were old powers
having well-disciplined regular forces armed to the teeth and with the
most developed weapons and advanced art of warfare of the age. In
administrative skills and experience they were far ahead of the Arabs
and the Muslims. Again, both the powers could easily mobilize twohundred-thousand-man armies at a time with about the same number
of soldiers at their back, while the greatest number of Muslim troops
never reached beyond thirty to forty thousand. The results were
always the same, defeat for the anti-Islamic forces.
The fact behind the reverses and repulses of the Roman and Persian
forces can be examined by their lack of true faith . The Muslims were
the followers of Tauhid (Oneness of Cod). Lack of Faith leads to
timidity while Faith makes one br.ave. Tauhid and Iman (Faith)
instilled in the Arabs the courage of conviction, which is the logical
consequence of Faith and which cannot be dominated by anything
however mighty and powerful that it might be .. Moreover, the
principles of governance that the Qur'an and the Prophetic examples
taught to the Muslims could not be matched in the least by the
developed powers of Persia and Rome.
Whenever the Muslim army halted for a few days, the populace of
that territory rose to welcome the Muslims as providers of peace ,md
prosperity. When the defeated nations watched with their naked eyes,
the blessings of peace, morality, di vine affection, justice, mercy,
courage and the ambition of their victori~s, they put themselves at
their service. It is an undeniable fact of history that humanity saved
itself only through the marching steps of the Arab forces. Again, the
unbreakable unit and the sense of supreme sacrifice, which Islam
created in the Companions, could not be achieved by powers
antagonistic to Islam.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphate

377

First Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate
After the Prophet ~ , the periods · of Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ and Umar
Faruq ~ maybe called the first half of the religious and spiritual rule
of Islam, the Rightly-Guided Caliphate. The prominent feature of thi s
period is that the material world now here dominates the Fai th. Vested
interests, relationships and friend ships were not allowed to influence
the work that had to be done a t any time. The people brought up
under the loving ca re and spiritual guidance of the Prophet ~
dominated the scene everywhere. They were held in hig h esteem by
everyone and worked as torchbearers. There was no trace of disunity
and discord among th e Muslims. Everywhere they were known for
their piety, purity, simplicity and hones ty.
The marching steps of the Muslim troops trampled Iraq, Syria and
Egypt but, up to the end of the Faruqi Caliphate, the Muslim
conquerors were not influenced in the least by the extravagant habits
and lu xurious living of the Christians and the Magians. Muslim
armies conquered Iraq and Persia but the conquerors used to stay
under the thatched roofs and tents of Kufah and Basrah. Similarly, the
conquerors of Syria hated to live in Syrian cities and preferred the
deserts and hills to sa feguard their simplicity and austerity , They
never said goodbye to their martial prowess and life of strain, trials
and tribulations, endurance and sacrifice. Abu Bakr Siddiq~ and
Umar Faruq ~ not only took pains to make them habituated to a life
of struggle and physical and spiritual exercise but they left before
them the highest quality of personal exa mples to follow and be
guided by.
They neither spent a single penny from the public treasury nor let
others do it. The caliphs of Islam had no personal concern nor ever
made any attempt for personal gain. But during the second half of the
Rightly-Guided Caliphate, these qualities of head and heart appeared
to be graduall y receding and with them ended the Righteous
Caliphate.

Second Half of the
Rightly-Guided Caliphate

Uthman bin Affan ~

Name and Pedigree:
His family lineage is Uthman bin Affan bin Abu Al-As bin Umayyah
bin Abd Shams bin Abd Munaf bin Qusai bin Kilab bin Murrah bin
Ka'b bin Luai bin Ghalib. His appellation was Abu Amr in the state of
Ignorance. However, after confessing Islam, he married Ruqayyah
the daughter of the Prophet ~ who gave birth to Abdullah, so his
appellation changed to Abu Abdullah. The maternal grandmother of
Uthman ~ was the full sister of Abdullah bin Abdul-Muttalib, the
father of the Prophet ~- Thus Uthman ~ was the cousin of the
Prophet ~ -

Excellences:
He was matchless in modesty. Zaid bin Thabit ~ reports the Prophet
to have said, "When Uthman once passed by me, one angel told
me: 'I feel ashamed in front of him for the people will assassinate
him." The Prophet ~ said, "Angels show modesty to Uthman as he
shows it to Allah and His Messenger." When someone mentioned
Uthman's modesty to Hasan ~ ' he remarked: "When Uthman wants

380

History of Islam

to take a bath, he feels so much ashamed of taking off his clothes even
after closing the doors that he is unable to stand erect." He migrated
twice, to Abyssinia and Al-Madinah. He resembled the Prophet ~ in
his physical appearance.
The Prophet ~ engaged the hand of his daughter Ruqayyah ~ to
Uthman ~ before his attainment of Prophethood . When she died on
the day of the battle of Badr, he married his second daughter Umm
Kulthum ~ to him. He is, therefore, known as "The Man of two
Lights". She also died in 9 AH . No man in the world other than
Uthman ~ ever married two daughters of a Prophet. He knew more
than anyone else about the rites of Hajj. He was the fourth man to
embrace Islam.
He accepted Islam through the efforts of Abu Bakr ~- He was very
wealthy among the Companions and most generous. He spent
lavishly in the way of Allah. He could not take part in the battle of
Badr due to the serious illness of Ruqayyah ~ and stayed behind in
Al-Madinah with the permission of the Prophet ;'t. However, he was
given his share from the spoils of war equal to the participants. The
Prophet i't said, "Uthman should be included among the Companions
of Badr." He had a remarkable position among the Companions for
his excessive prayers. He would sometimes stand in prayer the whole
night and fasted for years. He had bought a piece of land adjacent to
the Prophet's Mosque for the wives of the Prophet ;'t.
Once famine broke out in Al-Madinah. Uthman ~ rose to the
occasion and distributed food grains among the needy. The Muslims
of Al-Madinah once were suffering due to the scarcity of water. A Jew
had a well but he used to sell water at a very high rate. He purchased
the well from the Jew for thirty-five thousand dirhams and gave it for
use by the Muslims at large. He never told a lie.
From the day he came to the fold of Islam, he would set one slave free
every week. He never took pride in his being wealthy and never took
wine even in the state of Ignorance. He would narrate the Ahadith
with special care and precision. He gave in the way of Allah six
thousand camels and fifty horses for the expedition of Tabuk. He was
reckoned among the richest men of Makkah in the Age of Ignorance.

Physical Appearance:
He was a man of medium stature and his face was pockmarked. He
had a thick beard and he colored it with henna. His bones were wide,
complexion reddish, hands long, hair curled, shoulders wide and he
had beautiful teeth.

Selection for Caliphate
Umar Farug ~ had, after allotting three days, asked Miqdad ~ not
to allow entry of anybody into the assembly of the nominated panel
while it was in session except Abdullah bin Umar ~ to make the
number of the members of the panel odd, which would make it seven.
However, the Caliph had already ordained that Abdullah~ must
not be elected as caliph. In reply to a question he had explained that
the burden of the caliphate was heavy enough to be carried by one
person of the family and others must not be thrown into it to deprive
him of many comforts of life. When Umar Faruq ~ was requested to
nominate someone as caliph, he replied, "It would be valid for me if I
nominate anyone as caliph following the way of Abu Bakr. However,
if I were to nominate a caliph, he would be Abu Ubaidah bin AlJarrah, but he was departed before me; or he would be Salim, the
slave of Abu Hudhaifah, but he too died before me." Saying this, he
set up a panel composed of six members, which have already been
mentioned.
After the burial service was performed, Miqdad bin Al-Aswad ~ and
Abu Talhah ~ appointed Suhaib ~ as acting Caliph and Imam for
three days as per the will left by Umar ~- Afterwards, they along
with their men contacted Ali, Uthman, Zubair, Sa'd, Abdur-Rahman
bin Auf and Abdullah bin Umar Cc~, and assembled them in the house
of Miswar bin Makhramah ~ or Aishah ~ and sat down at the door.
Talhah ~ was still out of Al-Madinah. Meanwhile, Amr bin Al-As
and Mughirah bin Shu'bah ~ also came and sat down at the door.
When Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ came to know of this, he came and
made them leave the place so that they could not say they were
included in the consultative body. When all the members arrived,
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ got up and said, "Who among those

382

History of Islam

nominated for the caliphate withdraws his name so that he may be
given power to appoint the most excellent and suitable among you as
caliph?" All the persons present kept silent. After a while he
announced, "I give up my candidacy and I am ready to perform the
duty of appointing a caliph." All of them agreed to it and empowered
him to appoint the Caliph. However, Ali~ kept silent. When AbdurRahman ~ asked him about his silence, he said, "I agree with the
opinion of other members, but, you first must promise to make your
decision without any favor and personal involvement and do it with
an eye on the truth and for the welfare of the whole Ummah ."
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ said, "I give my word that I will do it
without showing any favor to anyone and without any personal
involvement just for the sake of truth and for the welfare of the
Ummah. But all of you should also promise to agree on the one who I
choose for the post, and you will rise against one who disagrees with
me." Having heard this, Ali ~ and all those present said with one
voice, "We all will lend support to your choice and help you in its
enforcement."
With this promise on both sides, the session was over and the
members went home and waited for three days for the final verdict.
During this period, Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ kept meeting men of
sound judgement and discussing the issue · with them. He says that
when he said to Uthman ~ in private, "In case I fail to pledge
allegiance to you, whom will you offer me to do this." He replied,
"You should pledge allegiance to Ali." Abdur-Rahman~ then put
the same question to Ali~ when he was alone, and he took the name
of Uthman ~- Abdur-Rahman ~ then asked Zubair ~ to give his
decision, he said, "Pledge your allegiance to either Uthman or Ali."
He then referred the issue to Sa'd ~ in private, he took the name of
Uthman ~- When he took advice of other men of sound judgement,
the majority appeared to be in favor of Uthman ~ On the night before the day of announcing the decision the members
of the panel again assembled in the same house. Abdur-Rahman bin
Auf ~ called Zubair and Sa'd ~ separately in private and said,
"Most of the people appear to be in favor of Uthman and Ali." They
too also favored the two. Abdur-Rahman then talked to Uthman and

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

383

Ali separately. The night ended and after the Fajr prayer the mosque
was crowded with people, all of them were eagerly awaiting the
announcement of Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~Before Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ could say anything, some persons
other than the members of the panel began to speak in favor of this
and that. Ammar ~ rose in favor of Ali~ while Ibn Abu Sarh and
Abdullah bin Abu Rabi'ah thought Uthman ~ worthier than others.
In such a crucial development, Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ pressed
Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ to make a hurried announcement lest
some trouble might raise its head. Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ got up
and said addressing the audience, "I did all within my power to know
the opinion of all the groups and classes of people and nobody is now
to go against my decision. All the members of the consultative body
and nominated panel have already conceded to my decision and I
have spent all my power to arrive at this decision." Saying this he
called Uthman ~ near him and asked him to declare his resolve to
follow the path shown by Allah and His Messenger ~ and the
Righteous Caliphs that passed away before him. Uthman ~ declared
that he would try his level best to follow the commands of Allah and
His Messenger ~ and follow the examples of Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ and
Umar Faruq ~- Following this, Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ himself
first pledged his allegiance to Uthman ~ and others followed suit.
At first Ali~ looked a little aggrieved at this sight and was about to
move out of the mosque. But, he turned back in haste and moved
towards the new Caliph passing through the rows and took Bai'ah at
the hands of the Chief of the believers. Talhah ~ was not present on
the occasion and hence could not take part in the deliberations. When
he called on Uthman ~ to pledge his allegiance, the latter told him
that he was elected Caliph in his absence, for they could not wait any
longer. Thus if he (Talhah) claimed the caliphate for himself, he
(Uthman) was ready to give it up in his favor. Talhah ~ said, "I don't
want to create any rift among the Muslims at this stage." Saying this he
stretched his hand for taking Bai'ah at the hands of the new Caliph of
Islam.
At the end of the Bai'ah session, Uthman bin Affan ~ came to the
pulpit and addressing the congregation asked them to follow the

384

History of Islam

good deeds. He also asked them to fear the evil effects of abundant
wealth and stressed on keeping the Pleasure of Allah in view. After
his preliminary address, he issued an order in the name of the
governors and officers mentioning the demise of Umar Farug~ and
his own election as the Caliph of Islam. All of them were enjoined to
work with honesty and in good faith.

First Case in the Court of Uthman ~
A few days before the martyrdom of Umar Farug~' Abu Lulu went
to Hurmuzan with a dagger. He was the same man who had
confessed Islam before the second Caliph of Islam and was settled in
Al-Madinah. When Abu Lulu was talking to Hurmuzan, another
inhabitant of Hirah, a Christian slave named Jafinah was also present.
Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr ~ noticed those three sitting together
and conversing with each other. When Abu Lulu saw Abdur-Rahman
bin Abu Bakr ~ approaching, he left the place in haste and his
dagger fell down and he clearly witnessed it. However, he could not
then notice the evil intention. But when Abu Lulu injured Urnar Farug
~ and was caught, Abdur-Rahman ~ recognized the dc1gger. He
then related the whole event.
When Ubaidullah bin Umar ~, the second son of Umar ~ heard all
this, he lost control and attacked Hurmu za n. When Sa'd bin Abu
Waqqas ~ saw Hurmuzan being wounded and dying, he held
Ubaidullah ~ - Since no caliph was there and Suhaib ~ was looking
after the necessary affairs, Sa 'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ produced
Ubaidullah ~ before him. Suhaib ~ kept the accused captive until
the installation of the Caliph.
When Uthrnan bin Affan ~ was elected to the post of caliphate and
preliminaries were accomplished, the case of Ubaidullah ~ was put
up before him. The new Caliph held consultations with the
Companions. Ali ~ gave his opinion that Ubaidullah ~ should be
slain by way of Qisns (death punishment for murder). But Amr bin AlAs ~ opposed it tooth and nail. He argued that it was most improper
to kill the son only a few days after the assassination of his father. The
people in general supported the viewpoint of Amr bin Al-As~-

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

385

The Caliph found himself in a fix. However, a subtle fact dawned
upon him. The event belonged to neither his period of caliphate nor
that of Umar 4fe,, for it had taken place before he took charge of the
caliphate. Thus he adopted the good device of paying the blood
money by declaring himself the guardian of Ubaidullah ~, the
accused. He then ascended the pulpit and made an effective speech
and left his audience happy and satisfied.

Governors of the Provinces
When Uthman bin A ffan ~ was elected and installed as the Caliph of
Islam, the following governors appointed by Umar Faruq ~ were
looking after the affairs of the provinces and territories under the
Muslim rule:
Nafi' bin Abdul-Harith in Makkah, Sufyan bin Abdullah Thaqafi in
Ta' if, Yala bin Umayyah in Yemen, Hudhaifah bin Mihsa n in Oman,
Mu 'a wiyah bin Abu Sufyan in Damascus, Amr bin Al-As in Egypt,
Umar bin Sa'd in Hims, Umar bin Utbah in Jordan, Abu Musa Ash 'ari
in Basrah, Mughirah bin Shu'bah in Kufah, Uthman bin Abul-As in
Bahrain.
The first action taken by the new Caliph in connection with the
governors was that he deposed Mughirah bin Shu'bah ~ from the
governorship of Kufah and called him back to Al-Madinah. H e was
replaced by Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~- When the people questioned
the action, he replied, "I ha ve not d eposed Mughirah for any fault of
his. T have rather done it as a part of the administration and an
ex pediency and exactly according to the will left by Umar as he had
personally mentioned this to me (Uthman)."

Important events of Uthman's Caliphate
The Conquest of Alexandria
Other than the conquest of Alexa ndria (Iskandariyah), during the first
year of the caliphate of Uthm an bin Affan ~ nothin g else m ajor
occurred. Heraclius had taken refuge in Constantinople (Istanbul)
after his fli ght from Asia Minor and Syria following the fall of Bait-ul-

386

History of Islam

Maqdis. Now he was worried about the safety of the rest of his
territory after losing all hope of restoring the lost lands. In the wake of
Amr bin Al-As' invasion of Egypt, Muqauqis, the king of Egypt had
yielded Egypt and Alexandria to him after earning peace by paying
the Jizyah. Heraclius considered Egypt his own province and
Muqauqis his subordinate. Shock and terror engulfed him on all sides
with the result that he died surrounded by defeat and dejection
during the caliphate of Umar Faruq ~- His son Qustuntin
(Constantine) succeeded him and lost no time in mobilizing a huge
army to restore Alexandria. However, Muqauqis prevented the
Romans from making entry into Alexandria and thus kept his
promise.
When the Muslims came to know of the Roman invasion, they came
quickly from Fustat (Cairo). The Romans then turned their attack to
the Islamic cantonments giving up their campaign for Alexandria.
Both the armies came upon each other and a severe battle broke out.
The commander of the Roman army was killed and a large number of
Roman soldiers met the same fate. The rest barely reached
Constantinople by boat. After the disastrous repulsion of the Roman
forces, Amr bin Al-As~ made a survey of the losses suffered by the
people of Alexandria and its suburbs and made up for all their losses,
for he held himself responsible for saving the Dhimmi and
compensating them for all reverses. Amr bin Al-As~ then lost no
time in demolishing the ramparts around the city of Alexandria and
then came back to his cantonment in Fustat. This was done to prevent
the possibility of any Roman attack in future trying to turn
Alexandria into a fortress. This event took place in 25 AH.

The Conquest of ·Armenia
The Roman invasion of Alexandria was, in fact, the result of the demise
of Umar Faruq ~ and the same event led to the uprising in the Persian
territories of Hamadan and Rey. They declared their freedom from
Muslim rule. Uthman bin Affan ~ dispatched Abu Musa Ash'ari, Bara'
bin Azib and Qarazah bin Ka'b $, to tackle the situation and they did
their job appreciably well. Umar Faruq ~ had deposed and called back
Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~- Uthman bin Affan ~ reinstalled him as

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

387

governor of Kufah. Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~ was then in charge of the
public treasury.
Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~, the governor of Kufah, borrowed some
money from Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~, the treasurer. After a few days
Abdullah ~ demanded the borrowed money which Sa'd ~ could
not pay . The matter took a turn for the worse and their relations
became strained. When Uthman bin Affan ~ came to know of this
unfortunate development, he deposed Sa'd ~ from the governorship
of Kufah in 25 AH, and replaced him by Walid bin Uqbah bin Abu
Mu'ait. Utbah bin Farqad ~ who was appointed by Sa'd ~ to look
after the affairs of Azerbaijan was also deposed along with Sa'd ~With his exit, the people of Azerbaijan raised their banner of revolt
against the establishment. Walid bin Uqbah wasted no time in
invading Azerbaijan and they were forced to earn peace on the old
terms and agreed to pay Jizyah. Walid bin Uqbah, who was the
governor of Jazirah during the caliphate of Umar Faruq ~ and at
present the governor of Kufah, was the foster brother of Uthman bin
Affan ~- Since Sa'd ~ was very pious and Allah-fearing, and Walid
bin Uqbah was not equal to him in this trait, the people of Kufah were
not at all happy with the departure of Sa'd and the arrival of Walid.
Mu'awiyah ~' the governor of Damascus had sent Habib bin
Maslamah •
to Armenia. He conquered a number of cities and forts
and forced the Romans to pay the Jizyah. With this news the Caesar of
Constantinople collected eighty thousand troops from Malit, Siwas,
and Quniah and invaded Habib bin Maslamah • . Habib sent the
account of these events to Mu'awiyah • and he gave the news to
Uthman bin Affan ~- The Caliph wrote Walid bin Uqbah, the
governor of Kufah to dispatch ten thousand reinforcements to
Armenia who immediately carried out the order with a dispatch of
eight thousand troops headed by Salman bin Rabi'ah to Armenia.
Habib bin Maslamah and Salman bin Rabi'ah jointly won Armenia
and reached up to the Caucasus Mountains. On the return of Habib
bin Maslamah • to Mu'awiyah • in Damascus, the latter himself
invaded the Roman territory. The Roman fighters escaped leaving
Antakiyah (Antioch) and their citadels behind. This event took place
in25 AH.

388

History of Islam

Events and Changes in Egypt
Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ known as Ibn Abu Sarh was the foster brother
of Uthman bin Affan ~- During the lifetime of the Prophet ~ he had
renounced Islam but later confessed it wholeheartedly. Uthman bin
Affan ~ sent him to Egypt as a governor and head of the public
treasury while Amr bin Al-As ~ was kept simply as a military
officer. When relations among the military officers worsened, the
Caliph deposed Amr bin Al-As~ and transferred the entire power of
Egypt and Alexandria to Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ Although Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ was renowned among the brave
horsemen of Arabia but Amr bin Al-As ~ was far ahead in
experience and popularity among the Egyptians who were shocked at
the dismissal of Amr ~- Their anger and dissatisfaction resulted in
their revolt against Abdullah bin Sa'd. Besides, when the Caesar of
Constantinople heard of the deposition of Amr bin Al-As~ and the
resulting uprisings in Egypt, he mobilized a huge army towards
Alexandria under the command of a seasoned general. The Greeks in
the city joined the camp of the Roman army and Alexandria fell to the
Romans after slight resistance.
Amr bin Al-As ~ was again sent to Egypt as a governor who
launched such a fierce attack at the Romans that they had to flee from
Alexandria after sustaining heavy losses and a heavy toll on their
soldiers. Amr bin Al-As ~ had conquered Egypt for the third time.
Although he had vowed to raze the whole city to the ground after
winning the battle, he forbade any such action. He rather built a
mosque at the site where the massacre and plunder were called off.
Nevertheless, when peace and normalcy returned to the region and
the administration was running smooth, Amr bin Al-As ~ was once
again deposed and replaced by Abdullah bin Sa'd ~- This time the
decision of the Caliph made Abdullah bin Sa 'd ~ feel uneasy and
uncomfortable over his reinstallation in Egypt, for his efforts to uphold
the deteriorating situation of the region the last time had met with
utter failure. However, he was now anxious to make amends for his
past failures.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

389

The Conquest of Africa
Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ sought permission from Uthman bin Affan ~
to invade Africa. Africa was then considered a country, it included the
area stretching between Tripoli and Tangiers. Moreover, Africa was
then considered the conglomeration of those countries, which make
up the northern part of the African continent, Tripoli, Algiers, Tunis,
and Morocco. Uthman bin Affan ~ allowed him to do what he
wanted. He marched towards his destination at the head of an army
of ten thousand. He first brought the chiefs of Barqah to obey and
they agreed to pay Jizyah. The Muslim commander then advanced
towards Tripoli capturing the territories falling on the way. At this
stage the Caliph dispatched from Al-Madinah fresh reinforcements to
lend help to Abdullah's army. The reinforcements included
distinguished men like Abdullah bin Umar, Abdullah bin Abbas,
Abdullah bin Zubair, Amr bin Al-As, Husain bin Ali, and lbn Ja'far

;t.
When the detachment reached Barqah via Egypt, Abdullah bin Sa'd
~ welcomed it. Now they jointly proceeded towards Tripoli. The
Romans tried to put up resistance but were repulsed. After the fall of
Tripoli, the Muslim troops marched ahead. Gregory, the King of
Africa was the vassal of Caesar. When he came to know of the march
of the Muslim army, he mobilized one hundred and twenty thousand
men and came face to face with the Muslim forces. Abdullah bin Sa'd
~ first invited Gregory to accept Islam. When Gregory flatly refused
the invitation, he asked him to pay the Jizyah . When he rejected that
also, the Muslim army drew up ranks and a fierce battle broke out,
which remained indecisive. Fresh Muslim reinforcements appeared
on the scene and the Muslim army called out Allahu Akbar.
Since the distance between Al-Madinah and the seat of battle was so
far, news could not be received immediately, so Uthman bin Affan ~
sent a fresh detachment from Al-Madinah headed by Abdur-Rahman
bin Zubair ~ . When Gregory inquired of the slogan shouting by the
Muslims, he was told that a fresh detachment had arrived and joined
the Muslim forces. Gregory grew very anxious. However, the battle
was not decided that day and both the armies withdrew to their

390

History of Islam

camps. The next day when the battle lines were again drawn
Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ was found missing. When Abdullah bin Zubair
~ inquired about his absence, he was told that Gregory had
proclaimed a reward of one hundred thousand dinars and the hand of
his daughter to the man who would bring him the head of Abdullah
bin Sa'd. For this reason Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ failed to come to
battlefield for fear of being a marked man. Abdullah bin Zubair ~
went to his camp and asked Abdullah bin Sa' d to make a counter
proclamation. He should offer a reward of one hundred thousand
dinars from the booty, the hand of the daughter of Gregory and the
conquered land to be governed by the man who would bring the head
of Gregory.
With such a proclamation from Abdullah bin Sa 'd ~, Gregory found
himself in great trouble. Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ appeared on the
battlefield. Both the armies fought gallantly but the battle remained
inconclusive. When the night set in, consultations were held for
adopting a new strategy. Abdullah bin Zubair ~ suggested that half
of the troops should go to battlefield and the rest remain inside the
camp. When the two armies exhausted by the daylong fighting leave
the battlefield for camp, the fresh half of the Muslim army should
attack the retreating Romans. The counsel received general
acceptance. The third day of the battle this strategy was put to
practice. When the two armies separated in the afternoon, Abdullah
bin Zubair ~ rushed out from the camp with the fresh detachment
and charged the Romans. They could not withstand the attack and
fled to their camp but could not save themselves because the Muslim
force surrounded the camp and the Romans were either killed or
captured. Gregory also fought against the Muslims and was put to the
sword by Abdullah bin Zubair ~is said that the enemy forces had besieged the Muslim army,
noticing this unfavorable condition, Abdullah bin Zubair ~ took
some brave Muslims with him and headed towards Gregory. The
enemy took them as messengers from the Muslim army and let them
go to the Gregory. They attacked and killed Gregory and raised his
head on a spear. This scene uprooted the enemy and caused its
destruction.]

The next day, Muslim army moved ahead and reached Sabitalah, the
headquarters of (northern) Africa which was also conquered in a
couple of days, and an immense amount of spoils fell into the hands
of the Muslims. The Muslims marched further and laid siege around
the fort of Jam, which was very strong and fortified. However, they
could not stand the Muslim onslaught and yielded on the condition of
paying one million as Jizyah. Abdullah bin Zubair ~ set out to AlMadinah with the glad tidings of the African conquest and one-fifth
of the spoils. Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ returned to Egypt from Africa
after an absence of one year and three months.

The Conquest of Cyprus and Rhodes
Abdullah bin Nafi' became the governor of Egypt the same year, 27
AH, that Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ came back to Egypt from the other parts
of northern Africa. Constantine again rose to make military
preparations for a fresh battle. In 28 AH, he dispatched a part of his
navy towards Africa, which reached the African coast and demanded
tribute for Caesar. But the Africans flatly refused to give any because
Caesar had lent no help when they were under the Muslim attack and
so they no longer held him as their ruler. This rude refusal led to
fighting between the Africans and the Roman army, which resulted in
the defeat of Africans. The Romans then advanced towards Alexandria.
Abdullah bin Nafi' was ready to give them battle. In the meantime
Caesar himself set off to conquer Alexandria at the head of a fleet of six
hundred boats. The Roman forces proceeded to Alexandria from both
sides. A fierce fight took place, which ended with the destruction of the
Romans. They escaped to Cyprus, which they used as their naval
headquarters and an arsenal for their weapons.
At the time of the death of Umar Faruq • Mu'awiyah ~ was the
governor of Damascus and Jordan while Hims and Qinnasrin were
governed by Umair bin Saeed Ansari. When he submitted his
resignation after the demise of Umar Faruq . , Hims and Qinnasrin
were consolidated with the province of Syria under Mu'awiyah • .
Palestine was also consolidated with Syria under Mu'awiyah ~ after
the death of Abdur-Rahman bin Alqamah, the governor of Palestine.
Mu'awiyah • gradually became the ruler of all the districts of Syria.

392

History of Islam

During the last days of the Faruqi caliphate, Mu'awiyah ~ had
sought permission to invade Cyprus from the Syrian coast. However,
Umar Farug ~ had some hesitation in giving permission for such a
campaign and the matter remained undecided until Umar ~ passed
away. Uthman bin Affan ~ permitted the naval attack on condition
that nobody was forced to take part in the adventure. Inspired by the
efforts of Mu'awiyah ~, a party agreed to invade Cyprus. The party
included Abu Dhar Ghifari, Abud-Darda', Shaddad bin Aus, Ubadah
bin Samit and his wife Umm Haram bint Milhan :$,,. Abdullah bin
Qais ~ was made the commander of the detachment, which left for
Cyprus by boat. When Constantine escaped from Alexandria, he had
taken refuge in Cyprus. An Islamic naval force chased him by boat
from Egypt and reached Cyprus. And this fresh naval detachment
from Syria also descended on the coast of Cyprus. When Umm Haram
~ mounted on a horse, it ran away with her and she fell down and
died . It happened exactly according to the prophecy of the Prophet ~ Constantine could not withstand the attack and fled to Constantinople
with great difficulties and succumbed to death.
However, according to other sources, frustrated by his defeat after
defeat some people killed him in his bathroom. Thus Cyprus easily
fell to the Muslims. Mu'awiyah ~ also arrived in Cyprus with a
detachment. After finishing his job in Cyprus he sailed to Rhodes.
There was a fierce battle but the Romans yielded after strong
resistance. On this island there was a giant-like copper idol, one of its
legs was on the coast of the island and another on a nearby islet off
the coast. The strait between the two legs was so wide that ships
would easily pass between them. Mu'awiyah ~ broke the idol into
pieces and sent them with the troops going back to Alexandria where
a Jew purchased them all. The conquests of Cyprus and Rhodes
opened the door for Muslim campaigns against Constantinople and
other countries of the region. These events took place at the encl of 28
AH or at the beginning of 29 AH.

Administrative Changes in Persia
In 27 AH, the people of Basrah sent a deputation to Al-Maclinah to
lodge a complaint against the governor Abu Musa Ash 'ari ~-

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

393

Uthman bin Affan ~ , immediately replaced him with his cousin,
Abdullah bin Amir bin Kurz bin Rabi'ah bin Habib bin Abd Shams,
who was only 25 years old. The Caliph not only installed him as the
governor of Basrah but also as the commander of the army of Oman
and Bahrain, which until then was under Uthman bin Abul-As
Thaqafi. Ubaidullah bin Ma'mar, the governor of Khurasan was now
transferred to Persia. The governorship of Khurasan was given to
Umair bin Uthman bin Sa'd who managed the affairs with skill and
strong hands and captured the territory up to Farghana. He, Umair
bin Uthman was deposed from the governorship of Khurasan
between 27 and 28 AH, and Ibn Ahmar was substituted for him.
Abdur-Rahman bin Abs was made the governor of Kirman but was
soon deposed making room for Asim bin Amr, while Imran bin
Nufail was brought to govern Sajastan.

Revolts of the Persians and the Islamic Conquests
Si.nee administrative changes took place rather quickly the Persians
took it as a sign of providence and so they indulged in hatching
conspiracies against the administration. They began to prepare for a
fresh encounter with the Muslims. The centers of these uprisings and
preparations were Istakhar and Jur. Ubaidullah bin Ma'mar, the
governor of Persia invaded lstakhar in 27 AH, and was martyred in
the encounter with the result the detachment under his command
scattered and escaped. Hearing this, Abdullah bin Amir, the governor
of Basrah marched forward with his army with Uthman bin Abul-As
at the vanguard. Abdullah bin Amir turned towards lstakhar while
Harim bin Haiyan laid siege around Jur. The Persians put up strong
resistance but they ran away after a bloody battle and Istakhar fell to
the Muslims.
Harim bin Haiyan's siege of Jur was protracted. During this period
Haram fasted in the day and fought with the enemy too. He would
broke his fast in the evening followed by prayers. Once he did not get
bread after breaking the fast. He observed fast the next day in the
same state. However, he did not get a meal that day either. The whole
week passed in successive fasts without food. When he grew too
weak he said to his servant, "What has happened to you my son. You

394

History of Islam

fail to give me bread and I am keeping fast with water alone for a
week." He replied, "My master; I bake bread for you daily without
fail, it is quite amazing that you didn' t get it." The next day the
servant baked bread and lay in wait to see who was taking it away.
He was shocked to notice that a dog came and took the bread and
made off with it. He followed the dog and saw that it went towards
the fortification of the city and it entered the city through a sewer. The
servant came back and related the whole event to Harim bin Haiyan.
He too was amazed. Haram and a few adventurous persons went into
the sewer, which led them inside the fortifications and they opened
the gates after killing the watchmen. In this way the Muslim army
made an easy entry into the city and conquered it. The uprisings both
in Istakhar and Jur were heavily put down and the insurgents met
their doom.

HaUof 29 AH
Uthman bin Affan ~ left Al-Madinah at the head of a party of the
Muhajirin and Ansar to perform Hajj of the House of Allah. He
ordered the tents to be pitched in Mina and collected the pilgrims for
the feast. However, the people disliked it for they thought it to be an
act of Bid'ah (innovation) as it was not a practice during the time of
the Prophet ;i, Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ and Umar Faruq ~- During this
same journey, a woman was produced before the Caliph. She was a
widow who was married for a second time and she gave birth to a
child within six months of the second marriage. Uthman bin Affan ~
sentenced her to be stoned to death. When Ali ~ came to know of
such a punishment, he called on the Caliph and said that Allah the
Almighty says in the Qur' an:
"And the bearing of him and the weaning of him is thirty (30)
months." (46:15)
·
It tells us that the duration of pregnancy and suckling goes up to
thirty months. And the pregnancy period mentioned at another place
in the Qur' an is:

"The mothers shall give suck to their children for two whole
years." (2:233)

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

395

Now if suckling period, i.e., two years or twenty-four months is
deducted from thirty months the pregnancy period comes to barely
six months. Thus she cannot be accused of committing adultery. On
hearing this, Uthman bin Affan ~ rushed someone to stop the
punishment but she had already been stoned to death . Uthman bin
Affan ~ expressed utmost sorrow over the incident and ordered
recompense.
The same year, the Caliph brought about the expansion of the
Prophet's Mosque by 160 yards in length and 150 yards in width and
constructed pillars of stone.

Events of JO AH
Walid bin Uqbah was the governor of Kufah. The poet, Abu Zubaidah
who was a Christian and later converted to Islam, kept company with
him, even though he had not abandoned drinking even after
accepting Islam. The people accused Walid bin Uqbah too of drinking
wine and the complaint was lodged with the Caliph. The governor
was called to Al-Madinah for an explanation. A group of the
complainants also reached AI-Madinah.
When Walid appeared before the Caliph, the latter shook hands with
him, which they resented. When the case of drinking was looked into,
there was no eyewitness against the accused. For this reason the
Caliph showed hesitation in giving him punishment. The others felt
the Caliph favored him. At last, a witness got up and said, "Although
I have not seen him drinking wine but I saw him vomiting wine." The
Caliph, based on the testimony of this witness, ordered the accused to
be whipped. Ali ~ was also present on the scene. Abdullah bin Ja'far
bin Abu Talib began to whip Walid. When the number of strokes
reached forty, Ali~ stopped it on the plea that even though Umar ~
had ordered to whip eighty times which is right but Abu Bakr~
whipped forty times for the same crime, which I prefer to follow.
Following this, Walid bin Uqbah was deposed from the governorship
of Kufah, and Saeed bin Al-As replaced him. [Other sources like
Tabari furnish details that the persons who complained and provided
witness, we~e not reliable enough, but this fact was not disclosed at
that time.]

396

History of Islam

The Event of Abu Dhar Ghifari ~
During 30 AH, the incident of Abu Dhar Ghifari ~ took place. He
was in Syria under Mu'awiyah ~- There arose a conflict between
Abu Dhar Ghifari and Mu'awiyah ~ over the meaning of the Verse:
"And those who hoard up gold and silver and spend it not in
the way of Allah, announce unto them a painful torment."
(9:34)

Abu Dhar ~ was of the view that, according to this Verse, any
deposit of money is unlawful and hence all the income should be duly
spent in the way of Allah. Mu'awiyah ~, on the other hand, argued
that spending in the way of Allah refers to paying Zalait, and the
amount over which Zakat has been paid, could be kept in deposit
without incurring any breach of Islamic code. Had unconditional
deposit of money been sinful, the Qur'an would not have mentioned
division of inheritance and shares thereof. When the people,
particularly the younger section, came to know of the view advanced
by Abu Dhar Ghifari ~' they made fun of him. When the matter took
a serious turn, Mu'awiyah ~ informed the Caliph about it. He wrote
the governor to send Abu Dhar ~ to Al-Madinah with due honor.
In Al-Madinah, he also set about propagating the same view. Since he
was stern by nature, they began to avoid him, but the younger section
of men would provoke him at times. In the meantime, Abdur-Rahman
bin Auf ~ passed way. He was a wealthy person and one among the
ten given glad tidings of Paradise during his lifetime. Someone
reported to Abu Dhar Ghifari ~ that Abdur-Rahman bin Auf ~ had
left behind riches in such a great quantity, so what did he have to say
about it. He issued his familiar Fatwa (legal opinion) in the case.
Thereupon, Ka'b Ahbar who had confessed Islam during the caliphate
of Umar Farug ~ and who was an accomplished scholar of the
Children of Israel, objected to it. At this Abu Dhar ~ lifted his stick
and fell on him saying, "O Jew! What do you have to do with these
issues?" Ka'b Ahbar fled to the assembly of the Caliph but Abu Dhar
~ appeared there chasing him with his stick. The slaves of Uthman
bin Affan ~ saved Ka'b Ahbar.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

397

When Abu Dhar's anger subsided, he called on Uthman bin Affan ~
and said, "I believe that the entire possession should be given in the
way of Allah. The people of Syria opposed me and put me to trouble
and now the people of Al-Madinah follow suit. Tell me what course
should I adopt and where should I go?" Thereupon Uthman bin Affan
~ extended his suggestion, "You go and settle in a village outside AlMadinah." So, Abu Dhar ~ settled in Rabadhah, a village three days
distance from Al-Madinah.

The Ring of the Prophet ~
The Prophet ~ had a ring which he used to seal his letters and orders.
After the death of the Prophet ~, it was preserved with Aishah 1$,
and then given to Abu Bakr Siddiq~ after he took over the caliphate.
After the first Caliph, it was handed over to Umar Faruq ~ who
entrusted it to his daughter and the Mother of the believers, Hafsah
~ to be given to one chosen as Caliph. Thus when Uthman bin Affan
~ was elected as Caliph, the ring was given to him. The same year,
30 AH, the ring fell into a well at Quba. All efforts to find the lost ring
proved an exercise in futility. From that day, Uthman bin Affan ~
had no peace in this life and remained surrounded by calamities of all
kind s. He had another ring of the same shape and pattern made.
The number of persons joining congregational prayers particularly for
Jwnu 'ah (Friday) rose to such an extent that they could not even hear
the Ad/11'/n. Thus, the Caliph issued an order to pronounce an Adhan
from a raised spot prior to the Adha11 preceding the address. Thus two
Adlu'in before the Jumu 'ah (Friday) prayer came into practice. The same
year Uthman ~ extended advice to the Companions to sell their
properties in Iraq and Syria and buy in Makkah, Al-Madinah and Ta'if.

Fall of Tabaristan
Assuming governors hip of Kufah, Saeed bin Al-As drew up an army
which included men like Hasan bin Ali, Abdullah bin Umar,
Abdullah bin Zubair, and Hudhaifah bin Al-Yaman ~- At the head of
this army Saeed bin Al-As invaded Tabaristan and Jurjan and
conquered these big cities and the entire territory.

398

History of Islam

Circulation of the Qur'an
When Hudhaifah bin Al-Yaman ~ reached Al-Madinah on route to
Basrah, Kufah, Rey and Syria, he expressed amazement over the fact
that the people of Iraq, Syria, Basrah and Kufah, and Persia had their
own way of recitation of the Noble Qur'an which was quite different
from each other. It was better that one and all were brought to the
same way of recitation. Uthman bin Affan ~ convened a meeting of the
distinguished Companions and placed the suggestion for their
deliberations and decisions. All of them endorsed the opinion of
Hudhaifah ~ - Uthman bin Affan ~ then had them bring the copy of
the Qur'an with Hafsah ~, the Mother of the believers, which was
compiled by Zaid bin Thabit ~ and other Companions during the
caliphate of Abu Bakr Siddiq~ and came to Umar Faruq ~ and then to
his daughter, Hafsah ~ after his assassination. The Caliph deputed a
number of qualified people to prepare a number of copies. He then sent a
copy of the Qur'an to each big city with the order that the Qur'an be
copied accordingly and all the old copies be set on fire. When the fresh
copy reached Kufah, the Companions expressed their joy over it, but
Abdullah bin Mas'ud ~ remained firm on his own recitation.

Events of 31 AH
According to the fresh orders issued from the office of the caliphate,
new governors were appointed to some territories. Harim bin Hassan
Yashkuri, Harim bin Haiyan Al:Abdi, and Khirrit bin Rashid were
appointed to the Persian territories. Ahnaf bin Qais was appointed to
Marwain, Habib bin Qarrah Yarbu'i was appointed to Balkh, Khalid
bin Zuhair was appointed to Harat, Umain bin Ahmad Yashkuri to
Tus and Qais bin Hubairah was appointed to Nishapur. Some of the
cities of Khurasan showed sign of uprisings. Abdullah bin Amir~
resorted to military action and forced them all to obey. He then put
down a revolt in Nishapur and then turned towards Harat followed
by Balkh, Tabaristan, Kirman, Sajastan and some provinces of Persia
which became his next targets. In the wake of this series af victories in
Iraq and Persia, Abdullah bin Amir came to be known as a terror and
people were filled with awe- at the mention of his name.

Yezdgird killed
The Persian Empire was destroyed during the caliphate of Umar
Faruq ~- The rest of the cities and frontier provinces were conquered
during the caliphate of Uthman bin Affan ~ - Nevertheless, Yezdgird,
the Emperor of Persia was still running from place to place for safety.
Sometimes he was in Rey and sometimes in Balkh, Marw, Isfahan,
Istakhar, Turkistan and China and back again to Persia . A party of
several thousand soldiers remained with him through thick and thin
in the hope that one day their past glory and grandeur might be
restored . This was the reason why the Persian provinces, districts and
cities would so often rise against the Muslim rule even though they
were instantly put down by the Muslim forces. In 31 AH, Yezdgird
reached the suburbs of Balkh at the head of a party from China and
Turkistan and captured some cities for a short period. His misfortunes
compelled him to flee and take refuge at the dwelling of a windmill
owner. He was in deep sleep when the house owner, out of greed for
his costly garments, killed him and threw his dead body into water
after stripping him of his clothes, ornaments and weapons. This event
took place in suburb of Marw on August 23,651 CE. Yezdgird passed
four years of his life in luxury, sixteen years in affliction and vagrancy
and the last ten years out of sixteen he passed as a fugitive. The
Persian troubles came to an end after Yezdgird was killed.
In this year, Muhammad bin Abu Hudhaifah and Muhammad bin Abu
Bakr who were with Abdullah bin Sa 'd bin Abu Sarh, the governor of
Egypt, showed their dissatisfaction and displeasure over the way the
ruler was managing affairs. Their resentment grew to an extent that
they came out in the open against Uthman bin Affan ~ for his alleged
policy of favoring an unworthy man like Abdullah bin Sa'd even
though he earned the displeasure of the Prophet~ during his lifetime.

Events of 32 AH
In Dhul-Hijjah 31 AH, when Abdullah bin Amir. left to perform
Hajj, an Persian general Qarin saw a golden opportunity for him to
restore some Persian provinces. He proceeded at the head of a forty

400

History of Islam

thousand strong army. Abdullah bin Hazim, a Muslim general, with
only a few thousand soldiers under his command, showed such
exemplary courage and valor that the Persians were defeated. With a
small party of three to four thousand soldiers, Abdullah bin Hazim
advanced to face the forty thousand strong army of the Persians.
Reaching near the enemy, the Muslim general ordered his soldiers to
wrap their spears up with pieces of cloth and then soak them in oil or
fat. When the army came closer to the battleground, he ordered his
soldiers to set fire to the cloth wrapped spears while it was night and
charge at the enemy with blazing fire. When the planning was
translated into action, the Persian soldiers fled in shock and
bewilderment at the sight of the flames. None of them had the
courage and consciousness to face the Muslim soldiers. A large
number of Persian soldiers were killed or captured .

Events of ll AH
Saeed bin Al-As~ took charge of Kufah after the dismissal of Walid bin
Uqbah, as the governor of the province. Saeed began to do what he could
to win the hearts of the people of Kufah. Malik bin Harith Nakha'i (Malik
bin Ashtar), Thabit bin Qais, Aswad bin Yazid, Alqamah bin Qais,
Jundub bin Zuhair, Jundub bin Ka'b Azdi, Urwah bin Al-Ju'd, Amr bin
Al-Hamiq Khuza'i, Sa'sa'ah and Zaid-the sons of Suhan, and Kumail bin
Ziyad were regular visitors to the private assembly of Saeed bin Al-As
~- All of them indulged in fun and pleasantries. One day Saeed bin AlAs, the governor of Kufah uttered, "This territory is the garden of the
Quraish." Hearing this, Malik bin Ashtar angrily remarked, "You call the
territory the garden of your people, which we have conquered with our
swords by the grace of Allah the Almighty?" Others too joined the issue,
which gave rise to a furore and created an unruly scene. When AbdurRahman Asadi tried to silence them, they fell on him and gave him a
severe beating with the result that he fell unconscious.
In the wake of this unusual event Saeed bin Al-As~ put an end to the
night assembly and set guards around to ban the entry of the regular
visitors. This action of the governor angered the people and they took to
murmuring against the governor and the Caliph too. Very soon they
were joined by men in the street. When opposition gained momentum,

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

401

Saeed bin Al-As~ sent the whole account to the Caliph who wrote back
that they should be sent to Syria to be looked after by Mu'awiyah ~Mu'awiyah ~ showed them utmost courtesy, dined with them and
fixed a daily allowance for them. He did this because the Caliph had
directed him to tactfully put them right. After a couple of days,
Mu'awiyah ~ politely asked them to recognize the leadership of the
Quraish and do nothing to disturb the unity of the Muslims. But q_ne of
the sons of Suhan gave a rude reply to what he said. Mu'awiy,yh ~
reported the matter to the Caliph and showed his inability to bring them
back to reason and uprightness. Uthman bin Affan ~ asked him to send
them to Hims to the care of Abdur-Rahman bin Khalid. When they
reached Hims Abdur-Rahman bin Khalid, the governor of Hims treated
them rudely and didn't permit them to sit in his assembly. This rough
and stern attitude and behavior of the governor affected them to the
extent that they repented for their past actions. When the Caliph was
informed of the development, he granted them permission to go back
to Kufah if they so desired.

Abdullah bin Saba
Abdullah bin Saba, known as Ibn Sauda' was a Jew from San'a. He
accepted Islam during the caliphate of Uthman bin Affan ~ with the
intention of taking advantage of the progress and prosperity of the
Muslims. He settled in Al-Madinah to go deep into the internal affairs
. and weaknesses of the Muslims to take advantage thereof. About the
same time Hakim bin Jabalah, a man from Basrah made it a point to enlist
with the Muslim troops and he plundered the Ohimmi whenever he had
an opportunity. He would sometimes commit highway robbery with a
band of criminals. When his evil activities went out of all proportions, the
matter was reported to the Caliph.
He wrote to the governor of Basrah to put Hakim bin Jabalah in
detention and his order was duly implemented. When Abdullah bin
Saba heard about Hakim bin Jabalah, he set out from Al-Madinah,
reached Basrah and stayed with Hakim bin Jabalah. There he
established a very close and cordial relation with Hakim bin Jabalah
and his friends. Afterwards, he set himself to creating doubts and
mischievous thoughts in the minds of the people around him, after

History of Islam

402

very cleverly presenting himself as one who is a well-wisher of the
After gaining the
Muslims and the family of the Prophet
confidence of many Muslims, he began to carry out his nefarious plan.
He first raised the question that if Isa (Jesus) %:§1could come back to
this world, why not Muhammad
In order to fortify his plea, he
began to misinterpret the meaning of the Verse:

*·

*?

"Verily, He Who has given you the Qur'iin, will surely bring
you back to place of return." (28:85)
He proposed thereby that the last Prophet ~ must come back to this
world. Following this, he began to bring the people round to another
point that every Prophet had a caliph (successor) and executor and
that of Muhammad
was Ali 4,, and he was the last executor as
Muhammad
was the last Prophet. Encouraged by the favorable
response from the gullible Muslims, he came out to openly propagate
his evil intentions of doing away with the Caliph and replacing him
by Ali 4,.

*

*

When his mischievous propaganda was brought to the notice of the
governor, Abdullah bin Amir ~, he called Abdullah bin Saba and
inquired of him as to who he was, where did he come from and what
was he here for. Abdullah bin Saba explained that he was interested
in Islam and he turned to Islam because of some weaknesses in
Judaism and had a desire to settle here as his subject. Abdullah bin
Amir ~ told him that, on inquiry, he arrived at the conclusion that he
was bent upon creating mischief and dissension in the ranks of the
Muslims. Since the governor had brought his secret plan to light,
Abdullah bin Saba left Basrah and came to another military base at
Kufah after issuing secret instructions to his followers. In Kufah he
found a section already working against the office of the caliphate and
its governor. Thus Abdullah bin Saba found this land more fertile and
the atmosphere more favorable and encouraging for his evil plans.
Abdullah bin Saba was antagonistic to Islam on one hand and was
hostile to Uthman bin Affan ~ on the other. He was, therefore,
restless to take his revenge on the Caliph. In Kufah, he first
established himself as a pious and God-fearing man and was very
soon held in high esteem. When Abdullah's mischievous activities

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

403

came to the notice of the governor, Saeed bin Al-As~, he called him
and took him to task. Abdullah bin Saba became suspect even in the
eyes of the sober and noble persons. Finding the atmosphere
unfavorable, he left Kufah and went to Syria.
Like Basrah he left behind a strong lobby in Kufah who were ready to
carry on his dirty business. Malik Ashtar and his friends and relatives
were the main figures to lend support to his plan. At Damascus, in
Syria, his nefarious plans could not make any headway and he had to
leave the city after being there only a short time. His next target was
Egypt where he moved very cautiously in the light of his past
experiences. He made love for the Prophet's family and support of Ali
~ the main plank of his propaganda. In order to expedite his plan in
an organized way he set up a secret society. He easily gained ground
in Egypt because the Egyptians and the Arabs living there already
had complaints against Abdullah bin Sa'd ~, the governor of Egypt.
Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ was also too preoccupied with the problems
created by the African Berbers and the Caesar of Constantinople to
pay attention to these internal affairs.
Abdullah bin Saba communicated with his friends in Basrah and
Kufah by letter, his group instituted a letter writing campaign with
the result that letters containing complaints were constantly being
sent against the governors to the people of Al-Madinah from Egypt,
Kufah and Basrah with charges of atrocities and malpractice brought
against them. Similar letters were dispatched from Basrah and Kufah
to Egypt and from Basrah, Egypt and Damascus to Kufah. Since no
one was made the subject of atrocities, in each city they thought that
this news was referring to other provinces which might be having
victims of these malpractices. All these accusing letters were directed
against Uthman bin Affan, the Caliph who was charged with favoring
despotic governors and refusing their dismissal. In view of the
complaint letters coming in torrents, Uthman bin Affan ~ sent
Ammar bin Ya.sir ~ and Muhammad bin Maslamah ~ to Egypt and
Kufah respectively to make inquiries into the affairs and inform the
office of the caliphate with the facts.
When Ammar bin Ya.sir ~ reached Egypt, both the sections growing
angry with the governor and the followers of Abdullah bin Saba

404

History of Islam

brought Ammar~ to their own way of thinking. They held him back
from going back to Al-Madinah saying that supporting the atrocious
ways of Uthman bin Affan ~ was to be avoided. Muhammad bin
Maslamah ~ wrote to the Caliph from Kufah that both the common
people and the noblemen were openly speaking against the Caliphate
and showing signs of discontent. About the sa me time Ash'ath bin
Qais, Saeed bin Qais, Sa'ib bin Agra', Malik bin Habib, Hakim bin
Sala.mat, Jarir bin Abdullah, and Salman bin Rabi 'a h who were
wealthy, influential and courageous supporters of the Islamic caliphate
left Kufah for other places. In view of the public protest and tumult
prevailing over a vast area, Saeed bin AI-As~ appointed Qa'qa' bin
Amr ~ his deputy and left for Al-Madinah to personally meet the
Caliph and give an account of the new developments in Kufah. With
his departure, the people of Kufah wrote to Malik Ashtar who was
then staying in Hims that there was a complete vacuum in Kufah and
they should come back without delay. In th e absence of a strict
governor, the antagonistic elements came out in open criticism and
challenged the authority of the Caliph. Gradually they mustered
enough courage to send a party of the disgruntled elements under the
leadership of Yazid bin Qais to reach Al-Madinah to dislodge Uthman
bin Affan ~ from p ower by force. However, Qa 'qa ' bin Amr~
stood in the way and arrested Yazid .
Yazid implored Qa'qa' ~ to forgive him because he had nothing
more than some complaints against Saeed bin Al-As ~ and his
mission was simply to seek the deposition of the governor. Qa 'qa ' ~
set Yazid free. However, shortly after that Malik Ashtar reached
Kufah with his party from Hims. His arrival generated a new zeal into
those causing disruptions and he declared his support to Yazid bin
Qais and his decision to join the forces of Yazid. Qa'qa' ~ could not
stop the joint forces of Yazid and Malik. They marched out of Kufah
and arrived at Jara 'ah near Qadisiya h.

Events of 34 AH
Uthman bin Affan ~ , the Caliph of Islam issued orders to all the
governors to meet him in Al-Madinah after Hajj for important
consultations. They assembled in Al-Madinah, Mu'awiyah ~ from

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

405

Syria, Abdullah bin Sa'd bin Abu Sarh .tk, from Egypt, Saeed bin AlAs .tk, from Kufah, Abdullah bin Amir .tk, from Basrah and others
from the smaller provinces. In addition to these governors, the Caliph
invited some men of sound judgement from Al-Madinah. The Caliph
put before them the issue of the prevailing anger and dissatisfaction
against him and sought their advice. Abdullah bin Amir ~ put
forward his suggestion that the unruly elements should be engaged in
activities of Jihad to fill their idle hours and charged them with
disruptive activities and uprisings. Saeed bin Al-As~ submitted the
suggestion that the leaders of the troublemakers be dealt with a heavy
hand for their punishments would scare away their followers. Even
though the Caliph showed hi s agreement with this suggestion he
thought it a difficult task. Mu'awiyah ~ came with the suggestion
that governors of each province should uphold their responsibilities
and clear the province off their existence. Abdullah bin Sa'd ~
suggested the point that they were all greedy and could, therefore, be
subdued by the power of the purse.
When the real causes leading to the riots and disruptions were
inquired into, it came to light that they were all whimsical and
unfounded. Some of them raised the point that each one of the
mischief-mongers and rioters should be put to death without showing
any politeness. Uthman bin Arffin ~ disagreed. He said that he could
only punish the people according to the limits set by the Qur'an. He
was, therefore, not within his rights to kill anybody unless he became
an apostate. In short, he could give capital punishment only for those
acts for which penal ordinances of Islam had already been issued. As
for himself, he could put up with all these tortures and hostilities with
patience and fortitude. Thus the session was brought to an end
without anything concrete decided.
However, the end product of the deliberations came in the shape of
dispatching a detachment against the people engaged in disruptive
activities and the governors were authorized to act accordingly. The
governors left for their respective provinces. When Saeed bin Al-As
~ reached Jara'ah in route to his province, he came across Yazid bin
Qai s lying there with a big armed force. He asked Saeed bin Al-As~
very rudely to go back for they would not allow him to step foot in

406

History of Islam

Kufah. Having heard this, the slave of Saeed bin Al-As ~ spoke
firmly that it was impossible for Saeed~ to return. Malik Ashtar full
of wrath, pulled down the slave by his legs and killed him instantly. He
then turned towards Saeed ~ and told him to go back, and ask Uthman
~ to send Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ -Then Saeed bin Al-As .l'~ went back to
Al-Madinah and gave the whole account to the Caliph. He called Abu
Musa Ash'ari ~ , and appointed him governor of Kufah. He departed
from Al-Madinah with a letter from the Caliph contairung: "The man of
your choice is being sent to you, and I will fulfill your desires to the extent
that the Shnri'ah permits me, and keep bearing with your excesses so as to
bring about reform in you."
Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ in his address from the pulpit on Jumu'ah day,
asked the people to do away with the rift among the Muslims and
obey the Caliph. This speech brought peace to Kufah, and those
unattached to the party of Ibn Saba felt satisfied. But the people
attached to Abdullah bin Saba and those harboring hostile feelings
against Uthman bin Affan ~ set about complaining against the
governors and officers appointed by the Caliph. They began to write
letters to the influential people of Al-Madinah to create suspicion in
their minds about Uthman bin Affan ~ - In response to the
complaints the people of Al-Madinah would grow angry with the
governors and officials and press the Caliph for their dismissal. But,
when they would come out faultless after inquiries, the Caliph
refrained from taking any action against them. They grew suspicious
of the fair dealings of the Caliph. Although men like Abu Usaid Sa'idi,
Ka'b bin Malik and Hassan bin Thabit ~ rose to stop the disgruntled
section from speaking against the Caliph but to no avail.

During this period the agents of Abdullah bin Saba flooded the
provinces under Islamic rule with these poisonous letters with the
sole mission of arousing people against the Caliph. The world of
Islam was then represented by five seats of power. Al-Madinah was
the center of power and grandeur from the beginning. Both Kufah
and Basrah were the settlements of belligerent Arab tribes and also
served as the magnificent cantonments of Islamic forces causing terror
into the hearts of the Persians, Armenians, Georgians and the people
of the vast land that belonged to the Persians in the past. Fustat or

Cairo was also a military cantonment wielding its influence up to
Tripoli and Palestine besides Egypt. Damascus was the main center of
power in Syria and the Muslim forces there were enough to cause
Caesar to pass sleepless nights. In addition, whenever the Roman forces
came face to face with the Muslim army they tasted defeat. Abdullah
bin Saba was shrewd enough to gauge the significance of these five
centers of power and influence. So he came to Al-Madinah first of all
and then left for Basrah followed by Kufah and Damascus. He could
not make much headway in Damascus owing to the presence of
Mu'awiyah ~However, he formed parties of the disgruntled elements in all the
other places. He also supported the viewpoint of Abu Dhar Ghifari ~
accusing Mu'awiyah ~ of using the public treasury to serve his own
interests declaring it to be the property of Allah, although it was, in
fact, the property of the Muslims and so it was to be distributed
among them. He also made Uthman bin Affan ~ the target of his
attack. During his campaign, he met Abud-Darda'~ and placed his
evil thoughts before him. Having heard Abdullah bin Saba, he
accused him of being a Jew working against the cause of Islam. He
then met Ubadah bin Samit ~ who heard him patiently and then
brought him to Mu'awiyah ~ by force and said producing him
before the governor of Damascus, "I presume that it is the same
person who had created bad blood between you and Abu Dhar
Ghifari." Mu'awiyah ~ drove him out to Damascus. He then stopped
in Egypt to propagate his evil ideas.
When complaint letters from almost every corner of the provinces and
cities under the Muslim rule came pouring into Al-Madinah, some
distinguished persons of Al-Madinah called on the Caliph and drew
his attention to the prevailing anger and dissatisfaction against the
governors appointed by him. Uthman bin Affan ~ then selected
some reliable persons and sent them to each province to look into the
situation and come back with a complete report. Thus Muhammad
bin Maslamah ~ was sent to Kufah and Usamah bin Zaid and
Abdullah bin Umar ,$, were sent to Basrah and Syria respectively. In
this way each big or small province and territory found one official to
report the state affairs to the Caliph.

408

History of Islam

All the investigators returned with reports that none of the governors
were found guilty of any evil act or excesses and all of them were
carrying out their duties within the bounds of Shari'ah . Besides, no
man of understanding and wisdom was found against any governor
or the Caliph. The people of Al-Madinah received the reports with
satisfaction. But very soon the situation took a disturbing tum. The
Hajj season was at hand. Taking c1dv,rnt,1ge of the opportunity, the
Caliph proclaimed among the citi,l'!ls of every city and town:
"Reports are pouring into Al-Madinc1h\ highlighting the excesses of the
governors of various provinces. So, I h,1, v sent orders to all the governors
to be present at the Hajj. Anybody bLming complaints against anyone's
governance should come and lodgv it in my presence and get his rights
either from me or from the governor ,iftcr the verification of the facts."

Edict of Uthman ~
Every governor also received order from the Caliph to this effect.
Thus following the orders, all the governors reached Makkah on the
occasion of the Hajj . In accordance with the scheme of Abdullah bin
Saba, his followers set out from every province and center but arrived
in AI-Madinah instead of Makkah. On the occasion of Hajj, Uthman
bin Affan ~ announced among the governors his readiness to listen
to complaints but not a single person rose to lodge any complaint.
Those present in the assembly of the Caliph were bent on finding
ways and means of eradicating the troubles. But their discussions
took a long time without any outcome. At this point Uthman bin
Affan ~ said addressing them: "Trouble is bound to appear in the
near future, but I don't like to be blamed for it, for whatever I have
done, it was solely for the welfare of the people." This utterance of the
Caliph silenced them all.
Uthman ~ came back to Al-Madinah after performing the Hajj. He
then assembled those from outside and invited Ali, Talhah and Zubair
$, also. Mu'awiyah ~ who had accompanied the Caliph from
Makkah was also present. First of all Mu'awiyah ~ got up and
addressed the assembly saying: "All of you, being the Companions of
the Prophet ~, and men of sense and sound judgment, are the
guardians of the Ummah. It is you who elected your fellow Uthman

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

409

bin Affan as the Caliph without any favor. As now he has grown old,
many things are heard from far and near. ln case you have arrived at
any decision regarding this, speak your mind and I am ready to reply.
However, if you have developed greed for the caliphate, you will get
nothing but taking a flight with your backs turned." Ali~ got enraged
at the last sentence and rebuked him and he sat down silently.
Following this, Uthman bin Affan ~ rose to address and said: "Abu
Bakr and Umar Faruq, after becoming Caliph, practiced caution
concerning their relatives with an eye on accountability, although the
Prophet ~ took care of his relatives and extended help to them. My
relatives are poor and so I do the needful for them. I am ready to do
away with my practice if you prove it invalid and unlawful."

Objections:
Uthman bin Affan ~ had spoken this much when a man got up and
raised the objection: "You unlawfully gave away wealth and property
to your relatives; for instance, you once gave the entire booty to
Abdullah bin Sa'd." Uthman ~ replied: "I have given him one-fifth
from the one-fifth of the booty. And we have such examples during
the caliphates of Abu Bakr and Umar."
Another person said: "You have conferred power and rules on your
relatives; for instance, you have appointed Mu'awiyah bin Abu Sufyan
governor of the entire Syria. You made Abdullah bin Amir governor of
Basrah by deposing Abu Musa Ash'ari; you installed Walid bin Ugbah
and then Saeed bin AI-As governors of Kufah by removing Mughirah
bin Shu'bah." Uthman bin Affan ~ replied, "Those governors are not
my relatives and they have ability to manage the affairs well. However,
if they don't deserve the post, I am always ready to change them for
others. Thus I have already put Abu Musa Ash'ari as the governor of
Kufah by removing Saeed bin Al-As."
Then the third person objected: "You have appointed undeserving and
inexperienced persons as governors; for instance, Abdullah bin Amir
is a young man and, he should not have been given such a high post."
Uthman ~ replied, "Abdullah bin Amir is distinguished in prudence,
ability and religiosity; being young is not a shortcoming."

410

History of Islam

Yet another person got up and said: "You love family members most,
and you give them heavy gifts." Uthman ~ replied, "Love of the
family members is not a sin. And I give them gifts from my own
possessions not from the public treasury. How can I give them
anything from the public treasury when I myself don't take a single
dirham from there? I am at liberty to give away anything to anybody
from my personal property."
One more person rose to say: "You have used your position for your
self and reserved grazing ground for your camels." Uthman ~
replied, "When I took charge of the caliphate, nobody in Al-Madinah
had camels more than me. But, today I possess only two camels and
that only for the purpose of Hajj, and I don't allow them to go to any
meadow. However, there is a reserved grazing ground for the state
camels and I cannot be blamed for this because this has come to me
from the past."
One of them questioned:"Why did you offer the complete prayer in
Mina while it should have been a Qasr (shortened one)?" Uthman bin
Affan ~ replied: "Since my family members were then residing in
Makkah, it was valid for me not to perform a Qasr (shortened)
prayer."
In short, objections of this nature were raised and Uthman bin Affan
• answered them fully and thoroughly. At the end of the assembly,
the people left silently. Amr bin Al-As ~ then said to Uthman bin
Affan • , "You are more polite to them than what is needed. This was
not the way of Umar, governors at a distance of hundreds of miles
dreaded him more than the slaves at his service. One should be
treated politely so far as there is no danger of any disturbance. Why
don't you slay those about whom you know very well that they are
creating a rift and confusion among the Muslims?" Hearing this
Uthman bin Affan • kept silent.

Events of l 5 AH
The governors of various provinces began to leave Al-Madinah. When
Mu'awiyah . , the governor of Syria decided to depart, he came to
Uthman bin Affan • and said, "I anticipate an attack on you and you

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

411

may not be able to resist it. It's better for you to accompany me to
Syria, for the Syrians are loyal and lend their full support to me."
Uthman bin Affan • replied, "On no account shall I abandon the
proximity and neighborhood of the Prophet '.!i." Having heard this
Mu'awiyah • said, "Let me send you an army from Syria to guard
you against any eventuality." Uthman • said, "I am not in favor of
putting my neighbors into trouble." Hearing this Mu'awiyah • said,
"You are bound to be deceived." In reply to this Uthman bin Affan •
said, "Allah is enough for me and what an Excellent Supporter He is."
After which he remained silent.
Mu'awiyah • then left the place and came to Ali, Talhah and Zubair
~ and after requesting them to provide protection to Uthman bin
Affan . , he set off for Syria.

Conspiracy of Abdullah bin Saba
Abdullah bin Saba had already finalized his nefarious plan during his
stay in Egypt. He had won Companions like Ammar bin Ya.sir ~ and
Warqa bin Rafi'• to his side. But, none besides his small group was
aware of his game. His love for Ali• and the family of the Prophet
::i was nothing more than a ploy for inciting people against the
caliphate. A considerable number of Muslim soldiers had joined his
party. Gradually Abdullah bin Saba won the hearts of enough people
to challenge the authority of Uthman bin Affan ~ and bring about
his deposition or do away with him. But the issue of his successor was
still the bone of contention. Gradually his party was divided in three
groups each supporting its own candidate from among Ali, Talhah
and Zubair • . Since Abdullah bin Saba had no interest in the unity
and strength of Islam, he held back his support from Ali ~ and left
the matter to the contenders. His main issue was the liquidation of
Uthman's caliphate.

Departure of the Caravan of Mischief-Mongers
At first a group of one thousand people were sent in advance
pretending to be a Hajj mission. The party consisted of AbdurRahman bin Udais, Kinanah bin Bishr Laithi, and Sudan bin Humran

412

History of Islam

and was headed by Ghafiqi bin Harb Akki. It was decided that the
entire party should not proceed at one time from Egypt. The party
was thus divided into four groups to leave Egypt separately and then to
meet after several stages. Another party of one thousand left Kufah in
four groups including Zaid bin Suhan Al-Abdi, Ziyad bin Nadr AlHarithi, Abdullah bin Al-Asam and Amr bin Al-Asam led by Malik
Ashtar; and yet another of the same number marched from Basrah
including Hukaim bin Jabalah, Dharih bin Abbad Al-Abdiyan, Bishr
bin Shuraih Qaisi, and Ibn Muharrish Al-Hanafi with Hurqus bin
Zuhair Sa'di at its head. All these parties left their cities in the month
of Shawwal 35 AH, under the pretext of going to Hajj. However, the
mission before one and all was to get rid of the Caliph either by
deposing or by killing him. At the appointed time, the parties coming
from different directions joined one another and proceeded to AlMadinah. Three stages from Al-Madinah, the party divided itself into
three separate groups each supporting its own candidate for the
caliphate. Thus the supporters of Talhah 4, halted at Dhu Khushub,
those of Zubair bin Al-Awwam 4, at A'was and the followers of Ali
4, at Dhul-Marwah. The majority of Talhah's supporters belonged to
Basrah and the major part of Zubair bin Al-Awwam's and Ali's
supporters were from Kufah and Egypt:respectively.
Ziyad bin Nadr and Abdullah bin Al-Asam asked the rioters to hold
at their respective spots until they went into Al-Madinah to look into
the prevailing situation there. In case the people of Al-Madinah were
prepared to face them, their attempt would prove abortive. The
rioters kept quiet and those two persons called on Ali, Talhah, Zubair
,:,~ and the Mothers · of the believers and acquainted them with the
purpose of their arrival. All of them deplored their intentions and
ordered them to go back.
It is worth mentionin g here that the followers of Abdullah bin Saba in
Al-Madinah had written forged letters in the names of Ali, Talhah,
Zubair, and the Mothers of the believers, to their followers in Kufah,
Basrah and Egypt who were against Abdullah bin Saba and his group.
The letters emphasized that Uthman bin Affan ~ was no longer able
to shoulder the heavy burden of the caliphate. Therefore the matter
should be brought to its end in the month of Dhul-Hijjah. Encouraged

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

413

by these forged letters, the rioters found it easy to indulge in acts of
plunder, massacre and doing away with the present caliphate. They
could not have, otherwise, mustered courage to plan an invasion as
regards Al-Madinah, the city of the Prophet ti, where even a strong
army of the disbelievers failed to make inroads during the battle of
the Trench. All the distinguished persons rejected their nefarious plan
outright but they found no preparations of any kind whatsoever in
Al-Madinah. They went back to the rioters and assembled their chiefs
and representatives for an emergency consultation. Allaying fears of
any defensive preparations in Al-Madinah from their minds, they
placed before them a suggestion that the parties belonging to Egypt,
Basrah and Kufah should contact Ali, Talhah and Zubair ~
respectively. They should make an attempt during separate meetings
to bring them round to their viewpoint saying that at no cost did they
like the caliphate of Uthman bin Affan ~Accordingly, they then offered their allegiance to them. But each of
them rejected their offer very rudely. Thereupon the party from Egypt
said to Ali~, "Since Abdullah bin Sa'd, the governor of our province
is cruel, we cannot leave Al-Madinah without getting him deposed."
With an eye on their obstinacy and nerve, Ali ~ and some other
Companions called on the Caliph and advised him to fulfill their
demand to stop the trouble and depose Abdullah bin Sa'd ~ as the
governor of Egypt. "Who will then be appointed the governor of
Egypt?" Uthman bin Affan ~ asked.

Ali ~ intercedes
Ali ~ and other Companions took the name of Muhammad bin Abu
Bakr who happened to be the supporter of Ali~ and was entrapped
by Abdullah bin Saba. Therefore, the Caliph issued an edict
appointing Muhammad bin Abu Bakr, governor of Egypt. After this
Ali ~ sent the rioters out. But the third or fourth day, all the parties
joined together and came into Al-Madinah crying Takbir with the
utmost fervor and cordoned off the house of the Caliph. Ali~ saw
them and said, "You had already left this place, what made you come
back?" They said, "The Caliph has sent a letter to Abdullah bin Sa'd
through his slave to kill us as soon as we reach there. We have seized

History of Islam

414

the letter and have come here with it and along with the parties from
Egypt and Kufah who want to share our problem." Ali~ said, "By
Allah this is an act of conspiracy and you are ill-intentioned." They
replied, "Whatever be the case, we have decided to kill the Caliph, and
we seek your assistance in the task." Ali~ angrily said, "How can I
help you?" Hearing this they said, "Why had you then written about
this?" Ali ~ firmly replied, "I have never written you anything."
Hearing this they looked towards each other with amazement. Ali ~
then left Al-Madinah to stay in Ahjar-uz-Zait and the rioters
surrounded the house of Uthman bin Affan ~ - They followed the
Caliph in prayers but they now gave it up and began also to hold
others back from standing in prayer behind him.
Witnessing the lurking danger around him, the Caliph wrote letters to
various provinces and sought their help, and in some cases the news
reached those places on its own. However, virtuous men and the
Companions persuaded the people in Egypt, Syria, Kufah and Basrah
to rush to the help of the Caliph. Mu'awiyah ~ and Abdullah bin
Sa'd ~ sent Habib bin Maslamah Fihri and Mu'awiyah bin Hudaij
respectively while Qa'qa' bin Amr ~ set out at the head of a party
from Kufah. A party from Basrah also proceeded to Al-Madinah. But
none of them were able to reach Al-Madinah before the martyrdom of
Uthman bin Affan ~- The mosque was under siege and after that, the
rioters prevented him from coming out of his home and cut off the
supply of water too. Although Uthman bin Affan ~ persistently tried
to convince the rioters that the letter was not written by him and
asked them to produce any witness but his plea was ignored by them.

Abu Ayub Ansari •

leads the Prayer

In the wake of his inability to come to the mosque, the Caliph
appointed Abu Ayub Ansari •
to do the job. However, after a few
days, Ghafiqi bin Harb Akki, the chief of the rioters, started leading
the prayers. Like Muhammad bin Abu Bakr, the governor of Egypt,
Muhammad bin Hudaifah was also working against the Caliph.
When Abdur-Rahman bin Udais marched towards Al-Madinah from
Egypt, Muhammad bin Abu Bakr had also accompanied them to AlMadinah, but Muhammad bin Hudaifah had stayed back in Egypt.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

415

On hearing the news of Uthman bin Affan's siege, Abdullah bin Sa'd
~ left for Al-Madinah with a party. But as soon as he reached
Ramlah, he came to know that Egypt was captured by Muhammad
bin Hudaifah. He hurried back but heard of Uthman bin Affan's
martyrdom while in Palestine. The siege continued for forty days.
When the rioters made a scene, Ali ~ sent both his sons Hasan and
Husain ~ to stand at the door of Uthman bin Affan ~ with locked
arms and stop the entry of the rioters into his house. Talhah and
Zubair ~ also sent their sons and they stopped their movements. The
rioters knew well that any harm done to them meant bearing the
brunt of Banu Hashim's fury as a whole. However, the rioters were
also in hurry because of the arrival of official forces from the
provinces could foil their plan. Thus they broke into an adjoining
house and made entry into the Caliph's house by scaling its walls.

Martyrdom of Uthman bin Affan •
When the rioters showed the letter written on his behalf, Uthman bin
Affan ~ declared it a forgery. Abdur-Rahman bin Udais, the
ringleader of the rioters rejected it saying, "If you are a liar, you are
not fit to remain as a Caliph. In case you are true in your claim then
such a weak Caliph should not be left to rule if he is not able to keep
control over his administration and let anybody write anything on his
behalf." At last, Abdur-Rahman bin Udais asked Uthman bin Affan
~ to quit the caliphate. But he said, "I can't put off the garment that
Allah has caused me to put on." That is, he refused to give up the post
of the Caliph. When the intensity of the siege increased and even the
supply of water was stopped, Othman bin Affan ~ went to the roof
of his house and reminded them of their sacrifices for Islam and the
position he held after embracing Islam. A section of the rioters seemed
to forgive him but Malik bin Ashtar intervened to keep them firm in
their plan. Moreover, when the rioters were convinced of the arrival
of rescue forces from the provinces, they were determined to do away
with the Caliph.
During these days, Aishah 1$, decided to go on Hajj. She sent for
Muhammad bin Abu Bakr to accompany her on the journey to
Makkah. But he refused to do so because he was involved with the

416

History of ls/nm

rioters. Hanzlah ~, the scribe of the Revelations, said to him, "You
refuse to accompany the Mother of the believers and instead follow
the fools of Arabia." Muhammad bin Abu Bakr gave no reply. Talhah
and Zubair ~ had closed their doors and would neither go anywhere
nor meet anybody. Ibn Abbas ~ faced the rioters at the door of
Uthman bin Afffm ~ and stopped them from drawing near. But the
Caliph insisted that he lead the Hajj caravan, although he said that
waging Jihad against the rioters was to him better than performing the
Hajj. Hasan bin Ali, Abdullah bin Zubair, Muhammad bin Talhah,
Saeed bin AI-As c:,~ stopped the rioters from opening the door and
fought to push them back.
But Uthman bin Affan ~ prevented them from doing so on oath and
called them in. The rioters set fire to the doors. They fought and drove
them out once again. Uthman bin Affan ~ was then reciting Qur'an.
When he reached the Verse:
'Those (i.e., believers) unto whom the people (hypocrites) said :
'Verily, the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great
army), therefore, fear them.' But it (only) increased them in
Faith, and they said: 'Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He
is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us)'." (3:173)
He said addressing those present, "The Messenger of Allah ~ has
taken a pledge from me and 1 firmly keep it, so hold yourselves back
from fighting the rioters." He also asked Hasan bin Ali ~ to go back
to his father but he declined the advice and kept at the door.
Mughirah bin Al-Akhnas ~ could not bear the situation and he
attacked the rioters along with some of his companions and was
martyred. In the same way, Abu Hurairah ~ launched an assault on
the rioters reciting the Verse:
"And O my people! How is it that I call you to salvation while
you call me to the Fire!" (40:41)
When Uthman ~ came to know of it, he insistently called him back.
Meanwhile, Abdullah bin Salam ~ came and he did all he could to
pacify the rioters but in vain. Among those present with Uthman bin
Affan ~ , some were upstairs watching the movements of the rioters

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

417

while others were at the gate stopping their entry. Othman bin Affan
~ and his wife Na'ilah, the daughter of Al-Furafisah were inside.

The rioters, scaled the walls, entered the house of Othman bin Affan
~ , and made an assault on him. First of all Muhammad bin Abu Bakr
came near Uthman bin Affan ~ and said catching hold of his beard,
"O long-bearded one, may Allah put you to disgrace." Othman~
replied, "I am not a long-bearded man, but Othman, the Chief of the
believers." Thereupon Muhammad bin Abu Bakr angrily said, "You
covet the caliphate even in your old age." Othman~ said, "Had your
father been alive, he would have valued my old age." At this
Muhammad bin Abu Bakr got ashamed and left. Followed by his
retreat a group of criminals came down scaling the wall. The group
included Abdur-Rahman bin Udais, Amr bin Hamiq, Omair bin
Jannabi, Sudan bin Humran, GhMiqi and Kinanah bin Bishr who first
struck Othman ~ with a sword. His wife Na'ilah came forward and
stretched her hand to stop the stroke with the result that her fingers
were cut off and thrown away. But he struck him a second time,
which led to his martyrdom. It so happened when Othman ~ was
reciting the Qur'an, his blood dropped on the Verse:
"So, Allah will suffice you against them. And He is the AllHearer, the All-Knower." (2:137)
Amr bin Hamiq gave him nine wounds with his spear. Omair bin
Jannabi moved forward and kicked him violently more than once so
that his ribs were broken. At every kick he would say: "It was you
who had imprisoned my father and the poor man died in captivity."
Na'ilah called out to those upstairs who were unaware of what was
happening in the house. The rioters had completed their evil act
before those upstairs arrived. The criminals fled and the slaves of
Uthman ~ killed a few of them.
Nobody was needed now to guard the door. The rioters then made a
forced entry into the house and plundered all the articles that they
found. The news of this tragedy spread like lightning. This soulshattering incident came to pass on Friday, Dhul-Hijjah 18, 35 AH.
The dead body of Uthman ~ lay unshrouded and unburied for three
days. At last Hakim bin Hi za m and Jubair bin Mut'im ~ went to Ali

418

History of Islam

~' he gave permission for him to be buried. The body was buried
between Maghrib and Isha' prayers. Zubair, Hasan, Abu Jahm bin
Hudaifah, and Marwan accompanied the bier. The rioters tried to
obstruct the burial service but held back on the intervention of Ali~Jubair bin Mut'im ~ led the funeral prayers. He was then buried
without bath and coffin.
At the time of the martyrdom of Uthman bin Affan ~ the following
governors were in power:
Abdullah bin Al-Hadrami in Makkah, Qasim bin Rabi'ah in Ta'if,
Ya'la bin Munyah in San'a', Abdullah bin Rabi'ah in Jund, Abdullah
bin Amir in Basrah, Mu'awiyah bin Abu Sufyan in Syria, AbdurRahman bin Abu Khalid in Hims, Habib bin Maslamah in Qinnasrin,
Abul-A'war Sulami in Jordan, Abdullah bin Qais Fazari in Bahrain,
Alqamah bin Hakim Kindi in Palestine from Mu'awiyah, Abu Musa
Ash'ari in Kufah, Jarir bin Abdullah in Qarqisiah, Ash'ath bin Qais in
Azerbaijan, Sa'ib bin Aqra' in Isfahan. Qa'qa' bin Amr was then the
commander-in-chief and Jabir Muzani and Sammak Ansari were in
charge of tributes, while Uqbah bin Amr was in charge of public
treasury in Al-Madinah and Zaid bin Thabit was the chief justice.
Othman bin Affan ~ died at the age of 82 after passi ng 12 years as a
caliph. He was buried in Jannat-ul-Baqi' leaving behind eleven sons
and six daughters.

A Summary of Uthman's Caliphate
Events of Othman bin Affan's tenure bring to view new phenomena
we did not witness during the caliphates of Abu Bakr Siddiq and
Umar Faruq ~- Many things had changed beyond recognition. Up to
the caliphate of Umar Faruq ~' wealth and worldly possessions had
no value. The Caliph was almost the poorest of all, no value was
attached to worldly comforts neither by the rc1ler nor the ruled. The
greatest desire of one and all was to lay down one's life in the way
and for the Pleasure of Allah the Almighty and uphold His Message.
Such a desire and feeling lessened to a great extent. Othman bin Affan
~ was a wealthy person and his way of life even after becoming
Caliph showed signs thereof.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

419

Countries and territories were conquered during the caliphate of
Umar Farug ~ bringing immense riches to the Muslims but they
didn't get any worldly comforts from it. But the same wealth during
the tenure of Uthman bin Affan ~ led them to develop love for a life
of luxury. They were overpowered by the desire to purchase property
and accumulate wealth. As a result of this, the characteristic spirit of
vitality and military abilities decreased, which were once distinct
signs of the Muslims and the Arabs. The thatched roofs began to
change into palaces and palatial buildings. Military prowess gave
way to rich habits. And this was the greatest misfortune that came to
the Muslims.
Through the era of Abu Bakr Siddiq and Umar Faruq ~ the
dominant force among the Muslims who had been in the company of
the Prophet ~, was that they considered Islam a thing of their own
and they had entrusted their lives to Islam. Islam had gained ground
in their hearts so deeply that all tribal signs were wiped out. Nothing
was dearer to them than Islam. The flood of conquests that engulfed
vast territories, brought people to the fold of Islam in large numbers.
Many witnessed the progress and prosperity of the Muslims and
joined the cause with their own well-being in view. Islam had not
come into their hearts to produce in them the sense of love and
sacrifice for the new faith.
Most of victories during the tenure of Umar ~ were the result of the
battles won by the fighters from Banu Wa'il, Banu Abdul-Qais, Banu
Rabi 'ah, Banu Azd, Banu Kindah, Banu Tamim, and Banu Quza 'ah. It
was they who had trampled under their feet Persian provinces, Syrian
territories and the fertile lands of Egypt and Palestine. They alone had
shattered the Persian and Roman Empires into pieces. But none of
these tribes had ever drunk directly from the fountain of the Prophet
As a result, they were not on a par with the men of the Quraish
and Hijaz in Faith and undying love for Islam. But Umar Faruq ~
had such vision that could see through all the problems and
impediments in their depths and complexities and found solutions so
skillfully that everyone was amazed. He had set up such a system and
established such a leading role for the Muhajirin and the Ansar that up
to his caliphate it remained impossible for elements outside this circle

*·

420

History of Islam

to even think of approaching this noble group. The position of the
Muhajirin and the Ansar was, during his caliphate, like those of
conquerors, yet men of wisdom.
Umar Faruq ~ had so prudently and cautiously preserved the
characteristic military prowess and vitality of the Arab fighters that
they were kept confined to settlements away from the lust and
attraction of the Syrian cities. He, on the other hand, kept
distinguished Companions and those in commanding positions away
from the company of the masses and ordinary classes.
He did this so wisely and imperceptibly that nobody was aware of it
and he managed their affairs in a manner that their awe and dread
could not be eroded from the minds of their subordinates. And, above
all, a party of the elite and men wielding power, influence and
prudence always remained clustered around him in Al-Madinah.
But, during the caliphate of Uthman bin Affan ~ such practices
gradually disappeared. Arab tribes began to consider themselves
equal to the Muhajirin and the Ansar and even superior to them. The
Companions who commanded dignity were scattered in far off places,
with the result that the commanding force of Al-Madinah was
weakened beyond description, and confusion and disorder became
common. Thus the capital of Islam could not longer remain the center
of power. In such a state of crisis, old tribal rivalries and feuds
strongly emerged and Islamic brotherhood could not contain them.
The new entrants outnumbered the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and took
away from them the reins of power and influence.
Uthman bin Affan ~ was polite to the extreme. But softness alone is
not helpful in running an administration; it needs the manifestation of
power and strong actions at times. During the caliphate of Uthman
bin Affan ~ , the Muslims indulged in a life of luxuries and comforts
on one hand and the dread and awe of the Caliph had eroded on the
other. In such an untenable situation, ambitions and power hungry
sections got ample opportunity to give vent to their desire of holding
power. Thus such men of ambition among the Quraish and Hijaz
could easily win the help and support of the new-Muslim tribes and
fighters.

The Quraish tribe before Islam was understood to be divided into two
parts, Banu Umayyah and Banu Hashim. Even though these two
tribes alone did not make up the entire Quraish and other tribes were
also important. But since these two tribes were opposed to one
another, other tribes were attached to either of the two. The power
and influence of Banu Umayyah had surpassed Banu Hashim at the
time of advent of Islam. As a natural corollary, Banu Umayyah was
vehemently opposed to the Prophethood for Muhammad ~ belonged
to Banu Hashim. Abu Sufyan hailed from Banu Umayyah and was so
dedicated to the defeat of Islam that he led the disbelievers against
Islam in the battles of Uhud and the Confederates. But, at last Banu
Umayyah including Abu Sufyan confessed IsJam. Thus the differences
and rivalries between Banu Hashim and Banu Umayyah came to an
end. Islam obliterated all signs and traces of racial and tribal
distinctions.
While Abu Bakr Siddiq ~ and Umar Faruq ~ held the rein of
caliphate, the state of affairs went undisturbed. But during the
caliphate of Uthman bin Affan ~, old rivalries staged a comeback.
And since Uthman bin Affan ~ was from Banu Umayyah, and he
eld his relatives very dear, they took undue advantage of that.
Besides these new developments, which took place due to the weak
aliphate, new entrants to the fold of Islam, the erosion of power and
influence of the Muhajirin, Ansar and the Quraish, mass indulgence in
the life of luxuries were some of the factors that proved advantageous
to Banu Umayyah. Marwan bin Al-Hakam as the main scribe of the
aliph, benefited their cause immensely. When the governorship of a
number of provinces came to their possession, and they were able to
wield power and influence throughout, they set off to restore their
position prior to [slam .
Gradually Banu Hashim and others also grew conscious of the
prevailing situation. But to say that Uthman bin Affan ~ was a party
to Banu Umayyah's policies and programs is far from reality and is a
baseless charge.
Nevertheless, the polite behavior and softness towards relatives played
a significant role in encouraging Banu Umayyah to cross all limits. And

422

History of Islam

they did what could not be conceived of during the tenures of the
former Caliphs. But, one is however, compelled to say that, although
good treatment to relatives is quite reasonable, a Caliph must walk
very cautiously upon this track. But he, perhaps, failed to see these
reasons. Marwan bin Al-Hakam, his cousin did all what he could to
deteriorate the situation but Uthman bin Affan ,tk, did nothing to get
rid of him, particularly when Marwan did not deserve such an
important post by virtue of his abilities and character.
With Uthman bin Affan ,tk, at the helm, Persian provinces began to
rise in revolt. But Islamic forces also rose to punish the insurgents.
The control and conquest of Seistan and Kirman are examples of this.
Besides, Harat, Kabul, Balkh and some other territories were
conquered in the wake of Turkish and Chinese invasions. Muslim·
armies won Cyprus and Rhodes as a result of the Roman assaults on
Egypt and Alexandria. Because of the war preparations of the Romans
of Africa and Asia Minor, Muslim territories extended to Tripoli and
Armenia.
In short, many important victories were won during the caliphate of
Uthman bin Affan ~ also. Following the instructions of Uthman bin
Affan ~ ' the governors constructed roads, set up educational
institutions and promoted trading and agricultural development. But
one cannot afford to overlook the undeniable fact that all such progress
and developmental works took place during the first half of his
caliphate, while disturbances and disruptions marked the next half.
The Muslims who were d evo ted to the task of preaching Islam and
uprooting idolatry, now worked for vested interests and engaged in
rivalries and feuds of the worst nature. Banu Umayya h had, by now,
multiplied their strength and influence and succeeded in expanding
their areas of domination far and wide.
It was, nevertheless, necessary for other Muslim tribes to vie with

Banu Umayyah in their activities injurious to Islamic unity and
solidarity. The sober and saner section among the Muhajirin and Ansar
could have come to the rescue but unfortunately it did not happen.
Meanwhile, the wretched Jew, Abdullah bin Saba dominated the
disruptive scene and caused such damage to the Muslims that they
have never completely recovered.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

423

Even during the Prophetic era, the Muslim Ummah had suffered at the
hands of the hypocrites led by Abdullah bin Ubai, while under the
leadership of Abdullah bin Saba, they inflicted an irreparable loss.
Abdullah bin Ubai could not make any headway because of the
presence of the Prophet !l;, but Abdullah bin Saba had no one to
combat his nefarious activities effectively.
To oppose Banu Umayyah, he used Ali ~ and easily antagonized
almost all tribes of Arabia against them. These were all those who
took pride in their deeds of valor and looked down upon the Quraish
and the men of the Hijaz. However, they were not among the first
entrants to Islam and were known as new-Muslims. Abdullah bin Saba
did not experience much difficulty in rousing the people against
Uthman bin Affan ~. He roamed through Basrah, Kufah and
Damascus and visited military cantonments. He found favorable
situations everywhere except in Damascus. He used the dispute
between Abu Dhar Ghifari and Mu'awiyah ~ for his purpose. At the
end of his travels he reached Egypt and began to give shape to his
plans from there. Abdullah bin Sa'd ~, the governor of Egypt was
ahead of all in self-will and freedom of action but deficient in
farsightedness and prudence, and careless about internal peace and
the welfare of the people. Abdullah bin Saba found here two or three
of the Companions who supported his cause.
He noticed that although Talhah ~ had more influence in Basrah and
Zubair ~ in Kufah, the whole world of Islam was still under the
influence of Ali ~ . Thus he sat down in Egypt to organize and
consolidate his camp so cleverly that the people of Kufah and Basrah
could be easily aroused against Banu Umayyah and Uthman bin Affan
~. In Egypt, he gave publicity to his love for Ali ~, his victimization,
his right of the caliphate and his being the sole executor after the
Prophet ~ . He did everything so cautiously and cleverly that in a very
short time, a party of Ali's supporters was formed. Very soon the entire
world of Islam was carried away by disruptions. Thus the Companions
lost the chance to bring Banu Umayyah back to the right path.
The worst kind of mischief caused by Abdullah bin Saba was a large
number of letters to the people of Kufah, Basrah and Egypt on behalf
of Ali ~ from Al-Madinah. These letters played a vital role in

424

History of Islam

winning the easily excited people to his side. His plan had two
purposes,. Uthman ~ was to be assassinated on one hand and the
finger of suspicion was to be pointed towards Ali ~' and alas, this
baseless doubt lingers on to this day. Abdullah bin Saba was friend
neither of Uthman ~ nor Ali ~; he was an enemy of both and his
sole aim was to destroy Islam. He, thus, got Uthman ~ on one hand
and caused immense harm to the reputation of Ali~ on the other.

Features and Characteristics of Uthman •
Uthman bin Affan ~ was affable and tolerant. Alcoholic drink was a
forbidden thing for him even during the days of Ignorance, and from
those days he never was attracted towards adultery and gambling.
His generosity benefited one and all even before he accepted Islam.
He would go to perform Hajj every year and had his tents pitched in
Mina, he never would come back without feeding the pilgrims and
these feasts were arranged out of his own pocket. The Prophet~ and
his family would so often pass through the state of starvation and
Uthman bin Affan ~ provided food for them. The Prophet~ had
often prayed for him: "O Allah, I am pleased with Uthman; You also
be pleased with him. 0 Allah. I am pleased with Uthman; You also be
pleased with him."
Famine once broke out during the caliphate of Abu Bakr Siddiq ~Scarcity of food put the people in great hardship. During one of those
days, news came that one thousand camels of Uthman ~ had arrived in
Al-Madinah laden with food grains. The starving population of the city
rushed to Uthman bin Affan ~ and requested him to sell them food
grains even at exorbitant prices. At this Uthman bin Affan ~ said, "Bear
witness that I have given away all the food grains to the poor and needy
of Al-Madinah."
Abdullah bin Abbas ~ relates, "The same night I saw in dream that
the Prophet~ was hurrying mounted on a horse in garments of light.
I rushed forward and submitted, 'I was eager to have a glimpse of
you.' He said, 'I am now in a hurry, Uthman has given in charity one
thousand camels laden with food grains and after he granted it, Allah
the Almighty has given a bride in marriage to Uthman. I am going to
join the marriage party'."

From the day he converted to Islam to his last day, he would set one
[slave free every Friday. Even when besieged by the rioters and in a
!state when the water supply was cut off, he continued this act. He
jused to live on simple food and wore simple clothes. However, he
!always served sumptuous food to his guests. Even during his
icaliphate, he never demanded to be treated preferentially. He would
isit beside others and show respect to one and all. He once asked his
\slave to take revenge on him for he had committed excesses. The slave
icaught his ear in response to his order. "Catch it rather strongly for
!the retaliation in this world is much lighter than that of the
iHereafter." His efforts in compiling the Q~r'an and unifying the
!method of recitation, and his expansion of the Prophet's Mosque have
!already been mentioned. He was in the habit of being at his work on
'time.

!Some Significant Indications
!At the time when the rioters had taken Al-Madinah by storm Aishah

i~ left Al-Madinah to perform Hajj. When she was on her way back to
IAl-Madinah, she heard of Uthman' s martyrdom and she returned to
!Makkah without delay.
[When the rioters mobbed Al-Madinah, Amr bin Al-As~, who was
!then in Al-Madinah, moved out along with his sons, Abdullah and
!Muhammad, they settled in Palestine, and only there did he receive
I
ithe tragic news of Uthman's martyrdom.
.
!When Abdullah bin Sa'd ~, the governor of Egypt, heard rioters
!besieging Uthman bin Affan ~' he proceeded to Al-Madinah but
jreturned on hearing that the Caliph had already been murdered. On
Ihis return he got the news that Muhammad bin Abu Hudaifah had
itaken over in Egypt, thus he was forced to stay in Palestine and later
ihe settled in Damascus.
:At the time of Uthman's martyrdom, Ali, Talhah, Zubair, Abdullah
[bin Umar and Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas t$, were in Al-Madinah, they
(found their honor at stake because among the rioters were insincere
lsupporters making false claims about them. They al~ shut themselves
!behind closed doors to avoid any connection with the rioters.

426

History of Islam

Rioter's Rule in AI-Madinah
From the day the rioters put a ban on the exit of Othman bin Affan ~
from his house and his attendance at the mosque, Al-Madinah had
virtually come under their rule. After Uthman's martyrdom, Ghafiqi
bin Harb Akki, the chief of the rioters, held the powers of the
caliphate for about a week and set about issuing all orders including
the appointment of someone to lead the prayers.
But the wiser section of them wanted to put a respectable man as
Caliph. They argued that in the absence of a reputable man as Caliph,
their successful efforts would be taken as a mere uprising and rioting.
Thus they decided not to leave Al-Madinah without electing a Caliph.
Abdullah bin Saba rushed to Al-Madinah incognito and joined his
party. He also favored the election of a Caliph. Thus they met Ali,
Talhah and Zubair :$, separately and requested each of them to accept
the responsibility of the caliphate. But each of them refused the offer
point-blank and they had to return empty-handed and frustrated.
At last, Abdullah bin Saba instilled in their mind a workable plan
according to which it was drummed up throughout Al-Madinah: "It is
the people of Al-Madinah who have always played the pivotal role of
electing a Caliph, and the Muslim Ummah accepted it wholeheartedly.
Now we give them just two days to elect a Caliph, if they fail to elect a
Caliph, we will kill Ali, Talhah and Zubair."
This announcement sent terror into the hearts of the people of AlMadinah who came out of their houses and hurried to Ali ~ and the
other two. While Talhah and Zubair ~ flatly refused to shoulder the
burden of the caliphate, Ali ~ agreed to it after initially refusing.
Following his consent, the people came in large numbers to take
Bai'ah (oath of allegiance) at his hand.

Ali bin Abu Talib ~

Name and Pedigree:
His family lineage is Ali bin Abu Talib bin Abdul-Muttalib bin
Hashim bin Abd Manaf bin Qusai bin Kilab bin Murrah bin Ka'b bin
Luai bin Ghalib.
The Prophet ~ addressed him with the filial appellation of AbulHasan and Abu Turab. His mother was Fatimah bint Asad bin
Hashim. She was the first Hashmite to be married in a Hashmite
family, accepted Islam and migrated from Makkah. Ali~ was the
cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet ~ - He was of medium height
inclined to short stature, hair receding from his head but spreading all
over the body, thick-bearded and wheat-complexioned.

Distinctive Features:
Ali ~ was among those who embraced Islam first of all. He was one
of those who collected the Qur'an and placed it before the Prophet ~ He was the first caliph from Banu Hashim. From childhood he never
worshipped idols. While migrating from Makkah, the Prophet ~ left
him behind to hand over the trusts to their owners. After carrying out
this order of the Prophet~' he also migrated to Al-Madinah.
Barring the battle of Tabuk, he accompanied the Prophet~ to all the
battles, for the Prophet ~ had made him the acting administrator of
Al-Madinah during the battle of Tabuk. In the battle of Uhud, Ali~
sustained sixteen wounds on his body. On the occasion of the battle of
Khaibar, the Prophet ~ had given the standard of Islam to him with
the prophecy that the standard-bearer would conquer Khaibar.
He liked his appellation 'Abu Turab' very much and he would
express his happiness whenever addressed by this. The reason he was
given this name was that he was laying down in the mosque and the
Prophet ~ came to the mosque and woke Ali ~ who was covered
with dust and the Prophet :I wiped the dust from his body saying,
"Get up, 0 Abu Turab." (Turab literally means dirt or dust.)

428

History of Islam

Excellences:
Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas .$ relates that on the occasion of the battle of
Tabuk, the Prophet ~ asked Ali ~ to stay in Al-Madinah. He said,
"You are leaving me behind among the women and children." The
Prophet ~ said, "Are you not happy that I am leaving you behind as
Musa (Moses)~\ had left Hamn (Aaron) ~I except that there will be
no Prophet after me."
On the occasion of the battle of Khaibar, the Prophet ~ said,
"Tomorrow, I shall give the standard to one who is to conquer the fort
and who has pleased Allah and His Messenger." Next morning all the
Companions eagerly waited to see who was that fortunate one. The
Prophet ~ called Ali~ and handed over the flag to him and the fort
was won as prophesized.
When the Verse concerning Mubahalah was revealed, the Prophet~
called together Ali, Fatimah, Hasan and Husain ,.$,, and said, "O
Allah! These are members of my family."
The Prophet ~ once said, "Ali is friend of one who is my friend." He
then added, "Allah loves one who loves Ali and shows enmity to one
who is the enemy of Ali." The Prophet ~ is reported to have once
said, "I have been ordered to love four persons." When the
Companions asked their names, he revealed, "They are Ali, Abu
Dhar, Miqdad and Salman Parisi."
When the Prophet ~ formed bonds of brotherhood among the
Companions, Ali~ came in tears and said, "You have formed bonds
of brotherhood for all but me." Thereupon the Prophet ~ said, "You
are my brother in this world and the next."
Umar ~ had once said, "Among all of us, Ali is the most prudent."
When someone referred to Ali ~ in front of A.ishah ~, she remarked,
"None more acquainted with Sunnah than Ali is now living." Ammar
bin Yasir ~ reports that once the Prophet ~ said to Ali ~' "Most
callous of the men are two: one is Ahmar who hamstrung the
dromedary of the Prophet Saleh(~\) and the other who will strike a
sword to set apart your beard from your body."

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

429

Justice and Words:
Ali ~ once said, "I thank Allah that even my enemy seeks my
opinion over religious issues. Mu'awiyah has sought my opinion
regarding the inheritance of a eunuch. I let him know that the matter
is to be decided according to the form of their private parts. If they are
male-like, it will come under the male law; if female-like, it will be
treated as female." When Ali ~ arrived in Basrah, lbn Al-Kawwa'
and Qais bin Ubadah came to him and said, "Some people say that
the Prophet :i had promised that you will be installed as caliph after
him. Who can be more trustworthy than you in this matter, so we ask
you the truth." He replied, "It is quite baseless that the Prophet :i had
promised me any such thing. Had it been so, how could I have
allowed Abu Bakr and Umar to stand on the pulpit of the Prophet :i
and not killed them with my own hands even if I had been alone to do
so."
He further said: "The fact is that when the Prophet's illness took a
turn for the worse, he asked Abu Bakr to lead the prayers. When
Aishah, the Mother of the believers, made an attempt to hold him
back from giving such an order, he angrily said, 'You are women of
Yusuf's days. Take none but Abu Bakr.' The day the Prophet ~
expired, I thought over the matter and I accepted one for my temporal
affairs too whom the Prophet :i had chosen for our religious affairs,
for he ~ was our leader in our religious matters and of our worldly
matters too. Thus we thought Abu Bakr is deserving and took Bai'ah
(oath of allegiance) at his hand and none went against him. I too
served him in letter and spirit, obeyed him wholeheartedly, fought as
a member of his army and accepted whatever he gave me. He passed
away appointing Umar as caliph. I treated Umar also like that and
carried out his orders without any flaw. On the eve of Umar's death I
thought that he would issue orders in favor of my caliphate with an
eye on my being one of the first to embrace Islam, my relationship
with the Prophet~ and other qualities. But he, however, dreaded the
consequences of picking a man of his own choice. Had he been a man
who took notice of his relatives, he would have preferred his son. In
short, the task of electing a caliph came into the hands of the Quraish.

430

History of Islam

When they assembled for the purpose, I thought they would not
ignore me. Abdur-Rahman bin Auf took a promise that we would all
obey the one elected as a caliph. He then caught the hand of Uthman.
From this I understood that the promise was taken from me to
support someone else. So I took Bai'ah at the hand of Uthman and
served him as I did with Abu Bakr and Umar. When he too passed
away, I thought those already passed were chosen as our Imam
(leaders) I become ready to accept Bai'ah. Thus the people of Makkah
and Al-Madinah and Kufah and Basrah rose to take their Bai'ah (oath
of allegiance) to me. Now a man has posed as my rival who is not like
me either in relationship or knowledge or in order of precedence in
embracing Islam, although I deserved caliphate."
A certain person said to Ali~, "You had said during an address: 'O
Allah! Bestow on me abilities such as you had given to the Righteous
Caliphs,' who were the Rightly-Guided Caliphs in your sight?"
Having heard this, Ali ~ replied with tears in his eyes, 'Those are
my friends Abu Bakr and Umar. Both of them were the leaders of the
guided and chiefs of Islam. The Quraish followed them and attained
salvation."
Ali abhorred lies. He once was saying something when a certain
person said he was lying. Ali~ cursed him, with the result that the
person lost his eyesight before leaving the assembly.
Once two persons sat down to eat. One had five loaves of bread while
another had three. Meanwhile, a third person came and they invited
him to share with them. When the third person was about to leave, he
gave them eight dirhams for what he had eaten. After he left the scene
a dispute arose over the division of the eight dirhams. The man with
five loaves of bread claimed five dirhams for himself and three
dirhams for his partner. The person who had three loaves of bread
insisted on half the amount, i.e., four dirhams. This dispute became so
intense that they took the matter to Ali~- He said to the man with
three loaves of bread, "Your loaves of bread were less in number, so
three dirhams are more than your correct share; it is better for you to
accept it." But he refused to abide by the judgment. Thereupon Ali ~
said to him, "Now you will get only one dirham as your share while
your partner gets seven dirhams." Hearing this he was left

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

431

astonished. However, while protesting against this decision he asked
Ali~ to help him to understand his calculations. Ali~ said, "Listen!
There were eight loaves of breads in all while you were three who
shared. Since the breads could not be shared equally, every loaf of
bread had to be broken into three pieces making twenty-four in all.
Although, it cannot be said who ate more than the other, it may be
assumed that each of you took an equal number of pieces, in other
words each of you ate eight pieces. Now out of nine pieces of your
three breads, the third man ate only one piece and eight pieces went
to you; while out of fifteen pieces of your partner's five breads, seven
pieces were eaten by the third person and eight pieces went to your
partner. Since the third person gave eight dirhams after eating one
piece from your bread and seven pieces from those of your partner,
you are entitled to have only one dirham while seven dirhams should
go to your partner." Hearing this, the person claiming half of the total
amount agreed to one dirham without harboring any doubt.
A man lodged a complaint with Ali ~ against a person that said that
he had copulated with his mother in dream. Ali~ said giving his
judgment, "The man describing the dream should be made to stand in
the sun, and his shadow be flogged."

Wise Sayings:
Ali ~ is reported to have said: "O people establish close relations
with your tongue and body, and keep a distance from your hearts and
actions. Man will, on the Day of Judgment, get according to what he
has done, and he will accompany those that he had loved. Make a
supreme effort in making your actions acceptable, for no action finds
acceptance without piety and sincerity. 0 scholar of the Qur'an, be
one who acts on the Qur'an. A scholar is one who acts upon what he
has read and brings about a closeness between his knowledge and his
acts. A time will come when there will be great disparity between acts
and knowledge. They will sit in a circle to praise one another and ask
one coming to join them to sit away from them. Bear in mind deeds
have no place in assemblies but they are related to Allah the
Almighty." "Beauty of manners is the essence of man, wisdom is his
helper and etiquette his legacy. Barbarism is worse than arrogance."

432

History of Islam

A person came to Ali ~ and submitted, "Make me understand what is
fate." He said, "Ask it not for it is a dark track." He again put the same
question and got a similar reply, "Try not to plunge in it for it is a deep
sea." He asked the same question once again and Ali ~ replied, "It is
the secret of Allah and it has been kept secret from you, why do you try
to explore it?" When he repeated his question again, Ali~ said, 'Tell
me whether Allah the Almighty has made you according to His Will or
as per your choice." He said, "Allah has made me according to His
Will." Thereupon Ali ~ said, "He is then free to make use of you
according to His Will, what is your choice then?"
"Every trouble has its limit and when it inflicts anybody, it goes to its
extremity. So, whoever is afflicted, he should not indulge in finding
remedies as he will be more distressed in it." "It is bestowing to give
anything when asked and to give without asking is benevolence.
Idleness in prayer, want of subsistence and decrease in taste are all
punishments for a sin."
Ali ~ said to Hasan ~ in his last counsel, "Wisdom is the greatest
wealth while stupidity is the worst pauperism; arrogance is the gravest
savageness and beauty of manner is the greatest generosity. Shun the
company of a stupid person for he wants to benefit you but puts you to
harm. Keep away from a liar, for he brings you closer to what is distant
and makes you distant from what is closest. Keep away from a miser too,
for he will cause you to renounce what is most wanted by you. Keep not
the company of a transgressor, for he will put you on sale very cheaply.
None should fear anything except sin and expect nothing from anybody
except from Allah. One should not be ashamed of learning what is
unknown to him. When a scholar is asked about something unknown to
him, he must unhesitatingly say: 'Allah knows better.' Patience and Faith
are like head and body, when patience leaves, Faith is also no longer
there, for how can a body exist without a head. A Faqih (Islamic jurist) is
one who lets no one lose their faith in Allah, nor gives permission for
committing sins, nor makes one fearless of the torment of Allah, nor lets
one inclined to anything else shun the Qur'an. Pomegranates should be
eaten along with the thin skin that is stuck with the grains, for it helps the
food digest with its entry into the stomach. A time is about to come when
a believer will be baser than the ordinary slave."

Important Events of Ali's Caliphate

Bai'ah of Caliphate
A week after the martyrdom of Uthman bin Affan ~' Bai'ah (oath of
allegiance) was taken on Dhul-Hijjah 25, 35 AH, at the hand s of Ali ~
in Al-Madinah. Following the martyrdom of Uthman bin Affan ~,
his murderers were going strong in Al-Madinah.
At first, they forced the people of Al-Madinah to elect a caliph under
threat. The majority of the rioters leaned towards Ali~ and the same
situation prevailed throughout Al-Madinah. When the p eople went to
Ali ~ to take Bai'ah, he said, "You pledge your allegiance to me but this
is not enough unless the Companions of Badr accept me as caliph."
Hearing this, they went to the Companions of Badr and brought them in
a group to Ali ~ - First of all Malik Ashtar took the Bai'ah while others
followed him.
Ali ~ then asked them to find out the intentions of Talhah and
Zubair ~- Following this, Malik Ashtar went to Talhah 4}k and
Hukairn bin Jabalah contacted Zubair ~ and both of them were
forcibly brought to Ali ~ ' who told them that he was ready to take
B11i'11lz at the hands of anyone who had a desire to become the Caliph .
They flatly rejected the offer. They were then asked to take Bai'11/z at
the hands of Ali~- At this, they began to ponder. Thereupon Malik
Ashtar said to Talhah ~ drawing his sword, "The matter is to be
decided right now."
In response to the demand of the situation, Talhah ~ said to Ali ~ '
"I will take Bai'alz provided you issue orders to take actions according
to the limits set by the Book of Allah and Sunnalz of His Messenger,
c111d take Qisas (retaliation) from the murderers of Uthman bin Affan."
Ali ~ promised to do the needful. Talhah ~ took Bai'ah extending
his hand which had become lame following the injuries he received
during the battle of Uhud. Some people took it as an ill omen. Zubair
~ . also agreed to take Bai'ah with the same conditions put forward by
Talhah ~ .

434

History of Islam

When Sa'd bin Abu Waqqas ~ was approached, he shut his doors
saying, "I shall do it after others have done it." He, however, told
them not to expect anything bad from him. Ali ~ did not press him
further.
Abdullah bin Umar ~ responded in the same way as Sa'd bin Abu
Waqqas ~- Malik Ashtar drew his sword to kill him but Ali~ stood
surety for him. Abdullah bin Umar ~ then left for Makkah to
perform Umrah (the lesser pilgrimage). They cautioned Ali ~ against
Abdullah's activities. Ali ~ was about to send people to arrest him
when Umm Kulthum ~, the wife of Umar ~ and daughter of Ali~
intervened and convinced him of the innocence of Abdullah~- Ali
~ felt satisfied.
Muhammad bin Maslamah, Usamah bin Zaid, Hassan bin Thabit,
Ka'b bin Malik, Abu Saeed Khudri, Nu'man bin Bashir, Zaid bin
Thabit, Mughirah bin Shu'bah, and Abdullah bin Salam ~ also
declined to support the new Caliph. Many others, particularly Banu
Umayyah stayed away and left for Syria without delay. Ali ~ asked
the Companions staying in Al-Madinah to explain their refusal. They
argued that they wanted to keep neutral owing to the prevailing state
of disturbances and killings.
Ali ~ then wanted Marwan bin Al-Hakam to appear but he could
not be found. When Na'ilah ~, the wife of Uthman ~ was asked the
names of the murderers, she gave the physical appearance of two of
them but failed to tell their names. When asked about Muhammad
bin Abu Bakr ~, she said that he came in but left before the
assassination. Some people from Banu Umayyah collected the cut off
fingers of Na'ilah ~ and the bloodstained clothes, and proceeded to
Syria to meet Mu'awiyah bin Abu Sufyan ~-

Second Day of the Caliphate
Next day Talhah and Zubair ~ called on Ali ~ and said that they
had pledged their support to him on the condition that retaliation
measures would be taken against the murderers of Uthman ~- If he
failed to take Qisas (retaliation), their Bai'ah would stand as null and
void. Ali~ said, "I shall take the necessary Qisas from the murderers

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

435

of Uthman, and do full justice to one and all. But until now the rioters
are too strong and the state of caliphate has not yet been consolidated,
I can only pay attention to this after the return to normalcy. Nothing
can be done at present." Both of them went back home. But
whispering and murmuring started. The rioters and the murderers of
Uthman ~ grew anxious of their safety while others were dissatisfied
with Ali~ over his lack of action. Thus opposition to the caliphate of
Ali ~ began to build up. The new Caliph was rendered helpless by
the circumstances.

Disobedience of the Rioters
Three days after assuming charge of the caliphate, Ali ~ asked the
people from Kufah, Basrah and Egypt to go back to their respective
places, but Abdullah bin Saba refused to obey his orders and most of
the rioters sided with him. It was, in truth, the greatest ill omen for the
caliphate of Ali ~ that those refused to obey his orders who were
apparently the strongest supporters and followers of the new Caliph.
Again Talhah and Zubair ~ called on Ali~ and requested him to
send them to Basrah and Kufah to put the people right as they had
large followings among them. But Ali~ grew suspicious and did not
allow it.

Useful Counsel of Mughirah and lbn Abbas~
On the third or fourth day after being installed as Caliph, Ali. issued
orders deposing all the governors appointed by Uthman bin Affan ~
and replaced them with his own. Knowing this Mughirah bin Shu'bah
~, a farsighted man and close relative of Ali~ called on him and said
that his decision to hold Talhah and Zubair ~ back from going out of
Al-Madinah would have an adverse effect on the Quraish, and he
would lose much of their sympathy. Moreover, he (Ali) had deposed
the governors of Uthman's period too hastily. He advised Ali~ to
leave those governors in their places and simply seek their obedience.
Ali ~ rejected the advice of Mughirah ~ outright.
The next day Mughirah ~ came again to Ali~ in the presence of
Abdullah bin Abbas ~- During the conversation, he advised Ali ~
to depose the governors of Uthman's period without delay. Since he

436

History of Islam

said that in clear contradiction of his previous advice, Abdullah bin
Abbas ~ remarked when he (Mughirah) left, "Mughirah had given a
wise counsel yesterday but he has deceived you today." When Ali ~,
sought his opinion he said, "It was better for you to leave Al-Madinah
at the time of Uthman's martyrdom. But now it is the demand of
reason that you keep the governors of Uthman intact until your
caliphate gains stability. If you act too quickly in deposing the
governors, Banu Umayyah will create doubt in the minds of people
that they were being deposed for demanding Qisas."
Hearing this Ali ~ said, "I shall straighten out Mu'awiyah with my
sword and make no concessions." Ibn Abbas ~ said, "You are a
brave man no doubt but the Prophet ~ has said: 'War is deceit.'
(Bukhari:3030) So, if you act on my advice, I shall suggest to you such
a device that, if you put it into practice, Banu Umayyah are sure to be
left wondering without finding any way out." Ali ~ said, "I possess
traits of characters neither like you nor like Mu'awiyah." lbn Abbas
~ said, "As for my opinion, it is better for you to leave for Yanbu
and stay there with your doors shut. In such a case the Arabs will go
from place to place without finding a worthy man like you. But if you
go about with the slayers of Uthman, they will accuse you of being an
accomplice to this heinous act." Ali ~ said, "I don't consider it
proper to act upon your advice; you should rather follow what I say."
lbn Abbas ~ said, "It is undoubtedly proper for me to carry out your
orders." Thereupon Ali ~ said, "I want to send you as the governor
of Syria in place of Mu'awiyah." Ibn Abbas ~ said, "Mu'awiyah is an
ancestral brother of Othman bin Affan, while I am related to you. So
they will kill or arrest me with my entry into Syria. It is better that you
first enter into correspondence with Mu'awiyah and take Bai'ah from
him." But Ali ~ rejected the proposal. Mughirah bin Shu'bah ~
witnessed that Ali ~ neither acted upon the advice of Ibn Abbas
nor of his own and so Mughirah ~ left Al-Madinah for Makkah.

Deposition and Installation of Governors
Ali 4l;k> appointed Uthman bin Hunaif for Basrah, Umarah bin Shihab
for Kufah, Ubaidullah bin Abbas for Yemen, Qais bin Sa'd for Egypt
and Sahl bin Hunaif for Syria.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

437

When Uthman bin Hunaif reached Basrah, some people accepted him
right away and showed their obedience but some others kept quiet to
follow the people of Al-Madinah.
Umarah bin Shihab appointed for Kufah was on his way to Kufah
when Tulaihah bin Khuwailid came across and advised him to return
because the people of Basrah wanted no replacement for Abu Musa
Ash'ari ~- And if he rejected his advice he would kill him then and
there. Following this advice he came back.
Ya'la bin Munyah, the governor of Yemen had left for Makkah before
the new governor Ubaidullah bin Abbas reached there to take charge
peacefully.
When Qais bin Sa'd reached Egypt, some people pledged their
allegiance while others delayed it; still others pleaded that they
wanted to do nothing before the arrival to Egypt of their fellows from
AI-Madinah.
Sahl bin Hunaif on the way to Syria met in Tabuk several horsemen
who inquired about him. On the disclosure that he was going as the
governor of Syria, they said to him in a firm tone, "If you are going to
Syria appointed by somebody other than Uthman, then it is better for
you to go back." Sahl returned from there. By the time he arrived in
Al-Madinah, other governors had also reached the capital of lslam.
Jarir bin Abdullah Al-Bajali was governor of Hamadan at the time of
the martyrdom of Uthman ~-Ali~ wrote him to come to him in AlMadinah after taking the oath of allegiance of the people of his
province, and he reached Al-Madinah accordingly.

Mu 1 awiyah's Support to Truth
Ali ~ sent a letter to Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ through Ma'bad Aslami.
In reply to the letter, Abu Musa ~ let him know: "The people of
Kufah have taken the oath of allegiance at my hands. Most of them
have done it with pleasure while others reluctantly.". This letter gave
him some satisfaction.
About the same time a letter was sent to Mu'awiyah ~ through Jarir
bin Abdullah and Sabrah Al-Juhani in Damascus. For three months no

438

History of Islam

reply came and Mu'awiyah ~ kept the Caliph's emissary waiting.
After that he handed over a sealed letter to his emissary Qabisah Absi
and sent him accompanied by Jarir bin Abdullah. The letter was clearly
addressed to Ali ~- They reached in the month of Rabi' Al-Awwal 36
AH. The emissary gave Mu'awiyah's letter to Ali~- When the envelope
was opened, it contained no letter. Ali ~ looked towards the emissary
angrily. The emissary shuddered from within and said, "I am an
emissary and safety of life is my right." Ali~ said: "Yes, you are safe."
The emissary then said, "Nobody will pledge support to you. I have seen
sixty thousand souls weeping over the bloodstained shirt of Uthman bin
Affan. They have also put the shirt on the grand mosque of Damascus to
provoke the people." Ali ~ said, "They want to take the revenge of
Uthman on me even though I stood absolved from Uthman's blood. May
Allah deal with the murderers of Uthman." Saying this, he returned the
emissary to Mu'awiyah ~-

Deviation of the Followers of lbn Saba
The rioters and the followers of Abdullah bin Saba abused the
emissary and wanted to beat him up but some people saved him and
he was some how able to reach Damascus. Jarir bin Abdullah was also
accused of being a party to the conspiratorial activities of Mu'awiyah
~ on account of his long stay in Damascus. As a result of this
allegation, he became so frustrated that he went to Qarqaisia instead
of Al-Madinah. Mu'awiyah ~ later called him to Damascus through
a messenger.

Preparations for the Invasion on Syria
When the people of Al-Madinah came to know of the strained
relations between Ali and Mu'awiyah ~, they feared further
bloodshed. They sent Ziyad bin Hanzalah to Ali ~ as a feeler. Ali ~
asked him to get ready. "What for?" Ziyad asked. "For invading
Syria," Ali ~ firmly replied. "You should deal with them rather
politely," he suggested. "No, the insurgents must be punished," Ali
~. said. Knowing the intentions of Ali ~, both Talhah and Zubair ~
called on Ali ~ and sought permission to go to Makkah to perform
Umrah. Ali ~ allowed them to leave Al-Madinah for any further

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

439

detention was unreasonable. He then announced throughout AlMadinah to get ready for the invasion on Syria. Furthermore, he
wrote letters to Uthman bin Hunaif in Basrah, Abu Musa in Kufah
and Qais bin Sa'd in Egypt to make military preparations from their
respective resources and send them to Al-Madinah on demand.

Military Action against the Muslims
When most of the people of Al-Madinah got ready for this purpose,
Ali ~ placed Al-Madinah in the charge of Qatham bin Abbas and
made his son Muhammad bin Hanafiyah the standard-bearer of the
Islamic army. Abdullah bin Abbas~ the commanding officer of the
right wing and Amr bin Abu Salamah ~ that of the left while he put
Abu Laila bin Al-Jarrah, the brother of Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah ~
on the vanguard. However, he was cautious enough not to engage
anyone from among the rioters for any military service. Ali ~ had
not finished the job of allotting military positions when news was
given to him that the Makkans were making preparations against
him. Following this news he postponed his march against Syria.

Preparations of the Mother of the Believers in Makkah
It has already been mentioned that Aishah 1$, had returned to
Makkah on hearing the news of Uthman's martyrdom. On reaching
near to Makkah she was also told that the people of Al-Madinah had
taken the oath of allegiance at the hands of Ali~- She returned to
Makkah in such a state that people grouped around her mount.
She said to them, "By Allah Uthman has been killed without any fault
and I shall take revenge on his behalf. It is unfortunate that people
collecting from the outskirts of the cities and forests, and the slaves of
Al-Madinah opposed Uthman simply because he had appointed
governors from our youths, although his predecessors had also done
this. When the rioters failed to establish their claim, they rose against
Uthman and committed a breach of trust. They shed the blood
declared prohibited by Allah the Almighty; they committed
bloodshed in the city that Allah the Almighty had made the place of
migration for His Messenger ~ , and did it in the month when

440

History of Islam

hostilities are forbidden and plundered property unlawfully. By Allah
even a finger of Uthman is superior to all the world. Uthman is free
from the blame they have put on him."
Abdullah bin Amir Hadrami was the governor of Makkah appointed
by Uthman bin Affan ~ - When he heard Aishah ~, he said very
firmly, "I will be the first to take revenge of Uthman's blood."
Hearing this all the men from Banu Umayyah who had reached Makkah
after the martyrdom of Uthman ~ , rose in support of action against the
murderers. Saeed bin Al-Asi and Walid bin Uqbah were also among
them. Abdullah bin Amir had reached Makkah after being deposed from
the governorship of Basrah, while Ya'la bin Munyah had come from
Yemen along with six hundred camels and six hundred thousand dinars.
They all sat together to find a way of avenging the blood of Uthman ~When Talhah and Zubair ~ reached Makkah from Al-Madinah,
Aishah ~ sent for both and inquired of them the reason behind their
arrival in Makkah. They gave the reason that the rioters being in
control, the noble and saner people found it totally unsafe to live in
Al-Madinah. Aishah ~ then said, "You should then rise against them
along with us." Both of them expressed their favor and support to this
plan. The entire population of Makkah was obedient to the Mother of
the believers. Four persons, Abdullah bin Amir and Ya'la bin
Munyah, the former governors of Basrah and Yemen, Talhah and
Zubair, were among the commanders of Aishah's army and considered
to be men of sense and determination.
At first, advice came from someone to proceed to Syria avoiding AIMadinah. But the proposal was set aside because of Mu'awiyah's
power and capacity to keep Syria intact. Then came the proposal to
proceed to Basrah for Abdullah bin Amir~ had a considerable circle
of his friends and well-wishers and Talhah ~ also had influence over
the people of Basrah. Thus they had hope of getting much support
there.
Someone suggested to face the eventualities in Makkah but Abdullah
bin Amir ~ stated that the Makkans would not be able to withstand
the onslaught of the army of Al-Madinah. Moreover the joint forces of
Makkah and Basrah would be enough to face any danger.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

441

In short, the proposal gained general support and preparation for
Basrah began in full swing. Other Mothers of the believers too
expressed their desire to accompany .A.ishah ~. When Abdullah
Omar ~ was contacted, he pleaded in support of the people of AlMadinah. He also stopped Hafsah ~ from accompanying .A.ishah ~
to Basrah. Mughirah bin Shu'bah ~ had also reached Makkah, he too
accompanied the army.

Departure from Makkah to Basrah
Abdullah bin Amir and Ya'la bin Munyah ~ had come to Makkah
with a large amount of money and goods from Basrah and Yemen.
Thus they took an active part in organizing the army of .A.ishah ~ .
Before the departure it was announced in Makkah that Aishah,
Talhah and Zubair ~ were leaving for Basrah and the people
sympathetic to Islam and demanding retaliation for the blood of
Othman ~ were invited to join their party. Thus an army of one and
a half thousand people marched to Basrah. People began to join on the
way and the army very soon swelled to three thousand. Umm Fad!
bint AI-Harith ~ the mother of Abdullah bin Abbas~ happened to
be with the force. She sent Zafar, a person from Juhainah tribe as a
courier to Ali ~ with a letter containing a detailed account of the
m1ss1on.
The other Mothers of believers accompanied .A.ishah ~ returned to
Al-Madinah from Dhat-Irq. Mughirah bin Shu'bah, Saeed bin Al-As
and some others also left army on the base of some differences.

The Governor of Basrah opposes the Plan
When the army came close to Basrah, .A.ishah ~ sent Abdullah bin
Amir J.,sk, into the city with letters in the names of the distinguished
personalities of Basrah and awaited their response. When Othman bin
Hunaif, the governor of Basrah came to know of the arrival of Aishah
·~ he sent to her some influential persons of Basrah as emissaries.
They called on the Mother of the believers and inquired about the
reason behind their arrival. She said explaining the reason, "The
rioters and miscreants from some tribes have spread rumors in order

442

History of Islam

to create confusion in the Muslim ranks and put Islam to harm. I have,
therefore come out to put such elements to right and acquaint them
with the real facts." They got up and called on Talhah and Zubair ~
and put to them the same question. Giving their own reason, they
said, "We have come out to avenge the blood of Uthman." They said,
"Haven't you two taken Bai'ah at the hands of Ali?" They replied,
"Yes, we pledged out support to Ali provided he avenge the blood of
Uthman. Moreover, swords were then hanging over our heads." The
emissaries went back to Uthman bin Hunaif in Basrah and
communicated to him the whole account. He heard all this with an
element of shock and asked their opinion. They asked him to be
patient. But he expressed his resolve to keep holding them back until
the arrival of Ali~- The emissaries left and closed their doors upon
themselves.
Othman bin Hunaif gave a call to the people of Basrah to get ready to
fight and to assemble in the mosque. When people assembled,
Uthman bin Hunaif asked a man named Qais to address the audience.
He said, "People! If Talhah, Zubair and their people have come to
seek safety, there is something wrong for even the birds of Makkah
are safe and nobody can do them any harm. And if they have arrived
for avenging the blood of Uthman bin Affan, then we are not the
murderers. It seems more proper to send them back with honor."
Hearing this, Aswad bin Sari' Sa'di got up and said, "They have not
come here taking us to be the slayers of Uthman bin Affan, they have
rather come to us to seek our help against the slayers of Othman bin
Affan." With these words uttered at the moment, the people got
infuriated and began to hurl gravel at Qais and the session ended in
confusion and disorder. It was, however, gathered that Talhah and
Zubair ~ had a following in Basrah .

Battle-Array
When Aishah ~ came up to Mirbad at the head of her army, Othman
bin Hunaif came out with his own and a battle line was drawn.
Talhah ~ was on the right wing and Zubair ~ on the left. When the
two armies came face to face, Talhah ~ emerged first of all and
described the excellences of Uthman 4'k, after glorifying Allah the

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

443

Almighty, and then appealed for avenging the blood of the martyred.
Then came out Zubair ~ and testified to what Talhah ~ had said.
Following this Aishah ~ uttered some words of wise counsel. The
impact of her speech divided the people of Uthman bin Hunaif into
two groups.
While one group was still adamant, another gave up the idea of
fighting for the reason that fighting against Talhah and Zubair ~
was not justified . When Aishah, Talhah and Zubair ,$,, witnessed the
rift in their ranks they returned to their camp. However, Uthman bin
Hunaif remained firm. Moreover, he sent Jariah bin Qudamah to
Aishah ~ and he said, "O Mother of the believers! The assassination
of Uthman was far better than your coming out on the back of this
wretched camel. Allah the Almighty has made you to observe Hijab
(veil) but you put the Hijdb to disgrace. If you have come here of your
own, it is better for you to go back to Al-Madinah; if by force, then
seek Allah's help." The speech had not ended when Hukaim bin
Jabalah attacked the army of Aishah ~ . But the battle stopped in the
evening. The next day Hukaim bin Jabalah drew the battle line again
and the two forces attacked one another. Hukaim was killed on the
battlefield and Uthman bin Hunaif had to taste defeat.
Basrah was captured by Talhah and Zubair ~- Uthman bin Hunaif
was brought as a captive. But Aishah ~ ordered him to be set free.
He went straight to Ali~- Although Basrah came under the sway of
Aishah, Talhah and Zubair ,;*", the condition was not different from
the rule of Uthman bin Hunaif, as Basrah was still a mixture of
elements for and against the winner.

Ali• marches from AI-Madinah
When Ali ~ was informed of the developments in Makkah and
Basrah, he expressed shock and grief and gave the people a call to
fight with the insurgents. Even though fighting against Aishah,
Talhah and Zubair ,$, was an unpleasant act for the people of AlMadinah, most of them responded to the call when they saw AbulHaitham Badari, Ziyad bin Hanzalah, Khuzaimah bin Thabit and Abu
Qatadah ,$, had approved. He left Al-Madinah at the end of Rabi' AlAkhir 36 AH. Some groups of the Kufis and Egyptians joined Ali~-

444

History of Islam

Abdullah bin Saba-the Jew and Hypocrite
Abdullah bin Saba also joined the army of Ali ~ along with his
followers. Abdullah bin Salam ~ came across them on the way and
said holding the bridle of Ali's horse, "O Chief of the believers; go not
from AI-Madinah. By Allah, if you go out, no head of the Muslims
will ever come back to Al-Madinah." The people rushed towards
Abdullah calling him bad names. Ali ~ asked the people to leave
him, saying he was a good man from among the Companions of the
Prophet ~- When he moved further ahead, he was informed to his
shock that Talhah and Zubair ~ had already marched into Basrah.
Ali ~ halted at Rabadhah and sent orders to various parts of the
country from here. Moreover, he sent Muhammad bin Abu Bakr~
and Muhammad bin Ja'far ~ to Kufah to collect and bring people.
Since the people disliked to fight with Talhah and Zubair ~,Ali~
promised not to attack them unless they forced him to fight back. A
little ahead of Rabadhah, a party from the Tai tribe joined the army.
Amr bin Al-Jarrah was put on the vanguard. At Faid, they came
across a person coming from Kufah. When he was asked about Abu
Musa Ash'ari ~, he remarked, "If you have not come out to make
peace with Talhah and Zubair, Abu Musa will not help you."
Ali ~ observed, "Talhah and Zubair first pledged their allegiance to
me and then committed a breach of trust. They obeyed Abu Bakr,
Umar and Uthman but have opposed me, if they but knew that I am
not different from them," saying this he cursed Talhah and Zubair ~-

The Two Muhammads in Kufah
When Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ and Muhammad bin Ja'far ~
gave the letter of Ali ~ to Abu Musa ~ in Kufah and tried to
persuade the people to join the camp of Ali ~, they showed no
interest. When Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ insisted, they remarked,
"Going out to fight is a temporal affair while sitting in peace is the
way to the Hereafter." Others kept to the line. When Muhammad bin
Abu Bakr ~ and Muhammad bin Ja'far ~ got angry and behaved
rudely to Abu Musa ~ he said, ''The Bai'ah to Uthman still hangs

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

445

round Ali's and my neck. If fighting is necessary, the murderers of
Uthman should be fought wherever they are met." They returned
empty-handed and gave the account to Ali .t-k, at Dhi Qar.

Ashtar and lbn Abbas i~ in Kufah
When the mission of Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ and Muhammad
bin Ja 'far ~ failed to bring any fruit, Ali .t-k, asked Ashtar to go with
lbn Abbas ~ and try to bring Abu Musa ~ around to their point of
view. They reached Kufah and tried their level best to persuade him
but he remained adamant in his opinion to the last and this mission
too failed .

Ammar bin Yasir and Hasan bin Ali ~ in Kufah
On the return of Ashtar and Ibn Abbas ~' Ali~ sent his son Hasan
.t-k, and Ammar bin Yasir ~ to Kufah. Being informed of their arrival,
Abu Musa ~ came to the mosque. He embraced Hasan ~ and said
addressing Ammar bin Yasir ~ ' "You joined the transgressors
instead of lending support to Uthman." Ammar~ denied the charge.
Meanwhile, Hasan ~ spoke out that people held no consultations
with them and they had nothing in mind but putting the matter right.
Moreover, the Chief of the believers feared none in his task of
bringing reforms to the people. Abu Musa ~ said with due respect,
"May my mother and father be sacrificed for you, you spoke the truth.
But the Prophet ~ has said, 'Affliction is to be caused in the near
future. In such a situation the sitting one wilJ be better than the
standing and the standing will be better than the mounted . And alJ
the Muslims are brethren among themselves. Their blood and
possessions are prohibited for each other.'" Abu Musa's statement
enraged Ammar bin Yasir ~ and he called him bad names. Abu
Musa .t-k, kept quite. But some people fell on Ammar but Abu Musa
saved him.
During these days A.ishah ~ wrote letters to the people of Kufah
from Basrah advising them not to lend support to anyone and either
sit behind closed doors or come to their help for they have come out
to avenge the blood of Uthman. Zaid bin Suhan began to read out the

446

History of Islam

letter to the audience. Shabath bin Rib'i hurled abuse which caused
anger in the audience, and they openly rose in support of Aishah ~.
Abu Musa ~ got up to pacify and advise them to keep indoors,
provide shelter to the oppressed, and keep the points of their spears
down and their swords sheathed.
Hearing all this, Zaid bin Suhan asked the audience to lend help and
support to Ali ~- A few others followed suit. Thereupon Ammar bin
Yasir ~ said, "People! Ali has called you to give your due. Corne out
and help him." Following this Hasan bin Ali ~ spoke: "O people!
Accept our invitation, obey us and help us in this present crisis. The
Chief of the believers says, 'Help us if we are victims and force us to
get your due if we are wrongdoers.' He has also said, 'Talhah and
Zubair had taken Bai'ah at my hand first and then broke it before
others.'" The speech produced the desired effect at once and they
rose in support of the Caliph. Malik Ash tar was also sent after Hasan
and Ammar ~, he reached Kufah at a time when Hasan bin Ali ~
was speaking to the people. His presence added to the zeal of the
people and nobody was ready to listen to Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ Hasan bin Ali~' Ammar bin Yasir ~ and Ashtar left Kufah at the head
of a nine thousand strong army and were greeted by Ali~ at Dhi Qar.
Speaking highly of them the Caliph Ali ~ said, "I have troubled you, 0
people of Kufah to join us in fighting the people of Basrah. However, if
they change their mind, it is most welcome, but if they insist on their
viewpoint, we shall treat them politely so that we are not accused of
initiating atrocities." Having heard this, the people of Kufah joined the
army of Ali ~ at Dhi Qar. Next day, Ali ~ sent Qa'qa' bin Amr~
towards Basrah. It was here that Owais Qarni took the oath of allegiance
at the hands of Ali ~-

Endeavor for Mediation
Ali ~ had sent Qa'qa' bin Amr~ to Basrah to know what was on
the minds of Aishah, Talhah and Zubair ,$, and to bring them to the
path of peace taking or renewing their Bai'ah . Qa'qa' ~ was very
eloquent and wise. He first submitted to Aishah ~: "What has led
you to such an act and what do you want?" She replied, "My sole aim
is to bring reforms to the people and put them on the line set by the

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

447

Qur'an." He then put the same question to Talhah and Zubair ~ and
got the same reply. Thereupon Qa'qa' bin Amr~ said, "If your aim
is to make the people follow the Qur' an, the purpose cannot be
achieved by the way you like it." They said, "The Qur'an enjoins Qisas
(retaliation) and we want to take it." Qa'qa'~ said, "How Qisas can
be taken this way? Establishment and stability of the caliphate are
among the top priorities, which bring peace and solidarity and may
ensure avenging the blood of Othman. Now, in the absence of peace
and order and any administrative system, how is anybody within his
rights to take Qisas. You have killed a large number of people here in
Basrah just for the taking of Qisas for Othman, but Hurqus bin Zuhair
could not be caught. And in the wake of chasing him, six thousand
men stood at his back to fight with his opponents and you gave up
chasing him. In the same way, you should have waited if Ali could
not take Qisas on account of his preoccupations in curbing violence
and consolidating power. How reasonable is it for you to stand
against them and thus aggravate the situation? In such a situation,
violence wiJI grow and the murderers of Othman will remain safe
from Qisas."
Saying aJI this, Qa'qa' bin Amr~ said in a heart-rending tone: "The
greatest reform at this time is to make peace with one another so that
the Muslims as a whole should live in peace and safety. You are the
leaders of virtues and stars of guidance. By Allah, keep from pushing
us into some trial lest you will not be able to be safe and the Muslim
Ummah will also pass through a great ordeal."
Aishah, Talhah and Zubair ,$, were immediately moved at the
utterance of Qa'qa' ~ and they said with one voice: "If Ali nourishes
such a thought and he has in mind his duty of taking Qisas, there is no
point in any dispute. Until now we thought he had some soft corner
in his heart for the murderers with the result they have joined Ali's
army and carry out his orders." Qa'qa' bin Amr~ said, "What I have
said is the reflection of Ali's thought." They said, "We too then have
nothing to do against him." Qa'qa' ~ then proceeded to the army of
Ali ~- A group of influential people of Basrah also accompanied him.
They wanted to know whether Ali ~ and the people of Kufah were
inclined to peace or not. They were informed that, people were saying

448

History of Islam

21bout Ali ~ that after conquering Basrah, he will kill the youths and
make their women and children slaves. This rumor was spread by the
followers of Abdullah bin Saba in Basrah who were a part of Ali's
army.
When Qa'qa' bin Amr ~ appeared before Ali ~ and gave the whole
account of his success in Basrah, he expressed great joy. The people of
Basrah then asked the people of Kufah who formed a part of Ali'J
army about their intentions. They spoke in favor of peace. Following
thi s, Ali~ called them and referred to his efforts to make peace. They
showed s21tisfaction and left with the good news.

Consultations for Mischief-Making
After the beginning of the peace mission, Ali ~ concentrated his
army a nd delivered an eloquent and impressive speech. He then
ordered a m arch to Basrah the next day. He made it clear that the
movement was not m eant for fighting but for bringing peace. Besides
this, he asked those to keep away who had surrounded the house of
Uthman bin Affan ~ - Learning this, Abdullah bin Saba and the
Egyptians grew anxious.
This group that was isolated from the rest of Ali's army, numbered
about two to two-and-a-half thousand men, some being very clever
and influential among them. Abdullah bin Saba held consultations
with various groups in a special assembly, which included Abdullah
bin Saba, Ibn Muljam, Ashtar and his gang including llba bin AIHaitham Sadusi, Salim bin Tha'labah and Shuraih bin Aufa etc.
Giving vent to their feelings they said, "Talhah and Zubair have been
d emanding Qisas and now Ali seems to be backing their cause. He
asked today to keep us separate from the army, tomorrow, after
joining hands with them, he will take Qisas and punish us all." Ashtar
said, "Talhah, Zubair and Ali are all one in their opinion concerning
u s. Now the pillar of peace will be erected on our blood . So, in my
opinion, Talhah, Zubair and Ali should also be sen t to Uthman. This
will be the end of all our troubl es." Abdullah bin Saba who was
presiding over the assembly, further said, "You are small in number
while Ali ha s an army of twenty thousand behind him. Talhah and
Zubair have another thirty thousa nd troops with them. Thus our job

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

is very difficult." Salim bin Tha 'labah suggested, "We should leave for
some where else until peace is restored." Shuraih seconded the
proposal. But Abdullah bin Saba rejected it as useless. Everyone then
rose to give his own suggestion. At last they turned to Abdullah bin
Saba to put forward his suggestion. He then said, "Brethren. It is
better for all of us to keep within the army of Ali. In case he expels us,
we should remain at a close distance from his army base on the reason
that we want to help his army in case a battle breaks out. Moreover,
we should leave no stone unturned to arouse both sides to fight one
another. Once the battle begins, our troubles are gone."

The Battle of Jamal
The next morning Ali~ gave marching orders to his army. A section
of the rioters accompanied the army while the other part kept itself at
a little distance. Bakr bin Wa'il and Abdul-Qais clans joined the army
on the way. In Basrah, Ali ~ pitched his tents at the grounds of
Ubaidullah Palace. From the opposite side, the army of Aishah,
Talhah and Zubair ;~ came to the same ground. Both sides kept silent
for three days awaiting the result of the ongoing peace talks.
In the meantime someone said to Ali~, "Why have you come here?"
Ali~ said, "I am here to curb the disturbances and bring about peace
for the Muslims." The man said, "What will you do if the people of
Basrah reject your peace efforts?" Ali~ said, "We shall leave them to
their state of affairs." He than said, "You may leave them but what
will you do if they are not ready to leave you." Ali ~ said, "In such a
situation we shall defend ourselves."
Meanwhile another person spoke out, "Talhah and Zubair maintain
that they have revolted to seek the Pleasure of Allah. Do they, in your
opinion, have any right in support of avenging the blood of Uthman?"
Ali ~ replied, "Yes, they also have a right." He then said, "Do you
also have a reason for delaying Qisas?" Ali~ replied, "Yes, when
something becomes doubtful, one should take cautious steps before
going into action." The same person said again, "What will follow for
them and for us in case a battle breaks out?" Ali .tk, said, "The person
killed on both sides will go to heaven."

450

History of Islam

After this, Ali ~ sent Hakim bin Salamah and Malik bin Habib to
Talhah and Zubair ~ to know if they were still firm on the peace
talks held between them and Qa'qa' bin Amr~; if so, they should
keep from starting a battle until the matter is finalized. Talhah and
Zubair ~ told Ali~ that they maintained their promise. Following
this Talhah and Zubair ~ came out from their ranks responding
while Ali~ too emerged from his side and they all came very near to
one another. Ali ~ then said addressing Talhah ~, "You have
collected this army against me. Could you give an excuse for your
action and prove it valid? Am I not your brother in Faith? Is not our
blood unlawful for each other?" Talhah ~ replied, "Have you not
hatched a conspiracy to kill Uthman?" Ali ~ replied, "Allah the
Almighty knows everything and He will send His curse on the killers
of Uthman. And Talhah, have you not taken Bai'ah at my hands?"
Talhah ~ replied, "Of course, I have taken Bai'ah but with a sword
hanging over my head, and on the condition of your taking Qisas
from the killers of Uthman."
Following this, Ali ~ turned to Zubair ~ and said, "Do you
remember that the Prophet ~ had once told you that you will fight
someone and you will then be a wrongdoer?" Having heard this
Zubair ~ said, "Yes, now I remember. But why did you not remind
me before my departure from Al-Madinah? Had it been in my mind, I
would not have left the city, I will not fight with you any more." [This
talk and the like of it is not approved by the research scholars to be
true.]
In the wake of this talk, Zubair ~ came back to his army and called
on Aishah ~ and said, "Ali has today reminded me something
following which I will not fight with him at any cost. I have now
decided to go off leaving all others." Aishah ~ was also nourishing
such an idea for the prophecy of the Prophet ~ on her mind. But
before her reply to Zubair ~, Abdullah bin Zubair ~ came in and
said to his father, "You decide to leave when you have already
brought both sides to the battlefield and incited one against another. It
seems the huge army of Ali has sent terror into your heart and made
you a coward ." Hearing this, Zubair ~ got up and moved with his
weapons into the army of Ali ~ , walked around and came back.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

451

When Ali ~ noticed him drawing near, he asked his men not to
obstruct his movement. Thus nobody showed disrespect to him.
Zubair ~ then said to his son, "Had I been afraid of Ali's army, I
would not have gone there all alone. The fact is this that I have vowed
not to fight with him." Abdullah ~ then asked his father to set his
slave free as an atonement for his vow. Zubair ~ said, "I have seen
Ammar in the army of Ali, and I remember the Prophet ~ had once
said: 'A rebel will kill Ammar.' In short, the thought of fighting has
gone out of my mind." Encouraged by such a peaceful atmosphere,
Abdullah bin Abbas ~ went to Zubair and Talhah ~ from Ali's side
and Muhammad bin Talhah ~ came to Ali~ on behalf of Zubair
and Talhah ~ and the peace terms were finalized by the evening of
the third day. The peace document was decided to be written and
signed the next morning.
Within these three days, Abdullah bin Saba and his party could not
avail themselves of any opportunity to create mischief. They grew
vehemently anxious when they came to know that the peace
document between the two sides was about to be signed the next
morning. They went into emergency consultations, which continued
the whole night. At last they fell upon the army of Zubair and Talhah
~ - They made a column their target, which answered back and a
full-fledged battle resulted.
Loud cries of war made Talhah and Zubair ~ come out of their tents.
On inquiry they were told that Ali's troops had attacked their army.
Thereupon Talhah ~ remarked, "Ali will not rest without
bloodshed." The hue and cry of fighting drew Ali ~ out of his tent
and the followers of Abdullah bin Saba told him that Talhah and
Zubair ~ had attacked his army all of a sudden and forced his men
to fight back. Ali ~ passed almost the same remark saying, "Alas,
Talhah and Zubair will not rest without bloodshed." Following this,
he started issuing orders to various sections of his troops. Fierce
fighting enveloped the battlefield. Military commanders on both sides
were unaware of what led to the all-out battle. However, both sides
appeared not to chase the fleeing soldiers nor attack the wounded nor
seize the property of their opponents. These calls from both sides
established beyond doubt that despite the fighting, neither of the

452

History of Islam

sides had any feeling of hatred. Both camps were expressing disgust
over what was going on.
Ka'b bin Sur went to Aishah ~ and said, "The battle has begun. It is
better for you to mount on a camel and go to the battlefield . Maybe
your presence hold them back from fighting and pave the way for
peace efforts to begin." Hearing this she mounted on the camel. As a
precautionary measure armor was put on her litter and the camel was
made to stand at a place from where the sight of battle was perfectly
clear. But things went contrary to this plan and the flames of war
leapt higher and higher.
Fighters from her camp were filled with great fervor when they saw
her on the battlefield as if she had come to increase the enthusiasm of
her troops. Soon after the beginning of the battle, an arrow hit the leg
of Talhah ~ and his sock was filled with blood, which was flowing
profusely without stop. When Qa'qa' ~ who was fighting on behalf
of Ali ~, noticed the plight of Talhah ~, he came near to him and
said, "O Abu Muhammad! Your wound is very serious; it is advisable
that you go back to Basrah at once." He did accordingly. But as soon
as he entered Basrah, he fell unconscious, died and was buried there.
Marwan bin Al-Hakam was fighting on behalf of Talhah and Zubair

~Talhah ~ was not in favor of fighting with Ali~ and stood alone
away from his army. He wanted to keep neutral, for he was
pondering over the utterances of Ali ~' in the talks between Ali and
Zubair il:@~ and the prophecy about Ammar bin Yasir ~ - The more he
thought over the issue of war, the more he became disheartened and
discouraged. When Marwan bin Hakam witnessed his indifference to
the ongoing battle, he felt tremendously annoyed. He then gave his
slave a sign who covered his face with a sheet. Thus being his identity
concealed, Marwan took an arrow dipped in poison and targeted
Talhah ~- The poisoned arrow hit the leg of Talhah ~ and pierced
the stomach of his horse, which fell down along with its rider. Talhah
~ then called the slave of Ali~ who had appeared on the scene and
renewed his Bai'ah to Ali ~ either on his hand or at the hand of
Qa'qa' ~ who also was there. After the renewal of the Bai'ah, he
returned to Basrah and passed away. When Ali~ came to know of

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

453

this, he invoked the blessing of Allah for him and kept admiring and
expressing sorrow for him.

Peacemaking Efforts of Zubair ~
When the battle broke out, Zubair bin Al-Awwam ~' who had
already decided not to fight, held himself back. Ammar ~ noticed
him and threw a challenge to fight. But he refused to fight with him.
Since Ammar ~ considered him the root of the trouble, he made an
advance and attacked him. But Zubair 4ffi, kept defending himself
without hitting him until Ammar ~ became exhausted and Zubair
~ had an opportunity to get away. Ahnaf bin Qais from Basrah was
lying with a large number of men encamped separately as a neutral
force. When Zubair ~ passed by his camp, Amr bin Al-Jurmuz, a
man from the army of Ahnaf bin Qais, followed him. He went near to
him and began to move along with him. In order to dispel any doubt,
he asked Zubair ~ to give his opinion on some issue. Arriving at AsSaba Valley, Zubair ~ stood in prayer. And as he lay prostrate, Amr
bin Al-Jurmuz struck him with his weapon and came straight to Ali
~- Someone informed Ali~ that the assassin of Zubair ~ had come
to meet him. He gave him permission with the remark, "Let him come
in and give him good news of hell as well." When Ali ~ saw Zubair's
sword in his hand, tears came down from his eyes and he said, "O
tyrant! This is the sword which had guarded the Prophet ~ for long."
These words cast such an effect that the assassin thrust his own sword
into his belly after passing some disrespectful remarks against Ali 4ffi,
and thus went to Hell.

Separation of Talhah ~
Talhah and Zubair ~ kept themselves apart right from the beginning
of the battle. But small chieftains of various clans were firm in their
resolve to fight on behalf of Aishah ~. But she also, on the other
hand, was in favor of peace and agreement. Moreover, there was none
left on their side to lead and guide in the fight. They did not even
know the real intention of Aishah ~ under whom they claimed to be
fightin g. However, she could not hold her troops back, they were all
under the impression that Ali ~ had deceived them by his sneak

454

History of Islam

attack after the peace negotiations were about to be finalized . The
people of Basrah had in mind the rumor that Ali~ had a plan to kill
their men and enslave their women and children.
As a result of these misgivings, more than ten thousand Muslims gave
their lives for no cause. And up to the last nobody knew the real cause
behind the ordeal. Every individual appeared to be accusing his rival
for the calamity that happened. Ali ~ was himself in command of his
army and he was organizing such fierce attacks on the opponents that
they were repulsed. Ali's army made such an advance that Aishah's
camel had come within the range of attack. Ka'b was holding the
halter of Aishah's camel and it was he who had escorted the Mother
of the believers to battlefield hoping for peace. The swordsmen of
Basrah clustered around Aishah's camel to save it at the cost of their
lives with the result the battle took a very serious turn.
In the wake of such a bloody battle, Aishah ~ asked Ka'b to leave the
halter and advance raising the Qur'an and calling the people to follow
the dictates of the Book of Allah. Ka'b did accordingly. But the
followers of Abdullah bin Saba showered arrows on him and he was
honored with martyrdom. This tragic event filled the people of Basrah
with zeal and fervor and in a short while there was a heap of dead
bodies around the camel of Aishah ~ . The people of Basrah were
laying down their lives to save the camel of Aishah ~. It became clear
to Ali ~ that the presence of Aishah ~ in the battlefield would never
allow the situation to cool down, for her mount had become the center
of killing and bloodshed. There were heavy showers of arrows on her
litter from all sides and she was cursing the murderers of Uthman ~ [These arrows were exposing the reality of Islam and Faith of those
who were showering them.]
Ali ~ ordered his men to target the camel, for its fall would bring the
battle to its end. After a number of attacks and counterattacks someone
got an opportunity to strike the legs of camel, which made it sit down
with a shriek. With the fall of the camel, the supporters of Aishah ~
dispersed. Qa'qa' bin Amr ~ hurried to the spot and asked Ali's men
to surround the camel on all sides. Ali ~ asked Muhammad bin Abu
Bakr ~ to take care of his sister and see that she suffers no harm.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

455

When her litter was taken out of the heap of the dead bodies and put
at a distance, Ali ~ reached there and sent his greetings and
compliments to her and said, "Dear mother! How are you? May Allah
forgive all your sins." Aishah 1$,, replied, "May Allah forgive your
sins too!" Following this, commanders of various columns appeared
to greet the Mother of the believers. A.ishah ~ then said to Qa'qa' ~:
"I wish l had died twenty years before the event of this day." When
Qa'qa' ~ related this to Ali ~ ' he too said, "I wish I had died twenty
years before this event."
This battle became known as the battle of Jamal (camel) because the
camel Aishah ~ was riding, had turned to be the center of fighting.
The supporters of Aishah ~ numbered thirty thousand out of which
nine thousand were killed, while one thousand seventy men out of
twenty thousand laid down their lives from the side of Ali~- [But the
fact is that about five thousand from each side were killed in this battle
(AI-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, 7 / 218). Besides the number of the fighters
described here seems to be exaggerated and opposite to each other.]
Ali ~ led the funeral prayers of all the slain and had them buried. He
also announced that those establishing their respective rights on them
could take the goods and properties away. When evening set in,
Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ took his sister, the Mother of the
believers, to Basrah and entrusted her to Safiyyah bint Al-Harith bin
Abu Talhah in the house of Abdullah bin Khalaf Khuza'i.
The next day, Ali ~ made his entry into Basrah where the people took
Bai'ah at his hands. Afterwards, Ali ~ came to A.ishah ~ . Since
Abdullah bin Khalaf had lost his life in the battle, his mother greeted him
with loud reproaches. But Ali ~ gave no reply. Although, the people
accompanying him showed displeasure, Ali ~ said to them, "Since
women are weak by nature, we forgive even the polytheist women and
these are the Muslim women." Ali ~ then showing the highest regard,
asked the Mother of the believers if she suffered any trouble.
Complete peace was restored and good faith prevailed on both sides.
Each of them apologized for the actions taken. Abdullah bin Abbas
~ was then appointed the governor of Basrah. Ali ~ asked
Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ later to make preparations for the

456

History of Islam

journey. Thus, in Ra jab 36 AH, Ali~ bade farewell to A.ishah ~ in
the company of forty ladies of influential families of Basrah headed by
Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ - He himself escorted the Mother of the
believers for several miles then the charge was handed over to Hasan
bin Ali ~- She arrived at Makkah, stayed there until Dhul-Hijjah, and
then left for Al-Madinah in 37 AH after performing Hajj.
A number of men from Banu Umayyah had also taken part in the
battle of Jamal against Ali ~- The battle being over, they left for
Damascus to meet Mu'awiyah ~- Abdullah bin Zubair ~ who had
received injuries in the battle, took shelter in the house of a man from
Azd tribe in Basrah. A.ishah ~ sent for him through her brother,
Muhammad bin Abu Bakr~, and took him to Makkah.

One more Mischief of the Saba Sect
After sending A.ishah ~ from Basrah, Ali~ distributed cash from
the treasury of Basrah among those who had fought under his banner.
Each of them received five hundred dirhams. Following this, he told
his men that in case of their attack and victory over Syria, their fixed
amount of stipend would be increased but they would be entitled to
get the same amount from the booty.
The followers of Abdullah bin Saba started criticizing and
reproaching Ali ~ openly following the end of the battle. They had
grown hostile simply because Ali~ had strongly forbidden plunder
of the goods and property. Ali's soft attitude, counseling and all
peaceful efforts to make them see reason, fell on deaf ears until one
day they disappeared from Basrah.
Anticipating their mischief, Ali ~ chased them at the head of an
army but they were not found. It is to be noted here that Abdullah bin
Saba had been the greatest supporter of Ali ~- However, the
conquest of Basrah had taken away from him the opportunity to
inflict anymore loss and harm to Islam by supporting Ali ~' so he
turned against Ali~ to continue his work against the cause of Islam.
It was, in truth, the same group consisting of the Muslim-like Jews
and anti-Islamic elements which later rose in the guise of the
Khawarij.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

457

Soon after the martyrdom of Umar Faruq ~' conspiracies, secret
societies and bodies of forces antagonistic to Islam sprang into being
and they still continue. No period in the history of Islam passed
without them. They sometimes appeared in the guise of Abu Lulu'
and his inciters and at times in the shape of Abdullah bin Saba and his
followers and the Khawarij. The same agency worked against Banu
Umayyah through the Abbasids and Alawis and then against the
Abbasids through the Umaiyads. Sometimes they appeared as Fidai
Ismaili group. The same secret societies appeared in the guise of
Freemasons, Nihilists and Anarchists and sometimes it put on the
garb of diplomacy in the foreign officers.
Even the early period of the Prophetic era was not free from these
secret conspiracies. Not more than twenty or twenty-five years was
there free from these activities and the period spanned the later part
of Prophethood and the Caliphates of Abu Bakr and Umar ~- Thus
the conspiracies hatched against the Islamic forces were neither
strange nor surprising.
The people of the Saba sect who had disappeared from Basrah after
openly criticizing Ali ~ , spread in a large area of Arab and Iraq, and
collected around them ruffians and riffraff who had their own axes to
grind. They proceeded first to Sajastan to set against Ali ~ all the
Persian provinces one by one so that he would not be able to manage
the affairs of the State peacefully, and not find an opportunity to
invade Syria. Being informed of their antagonistic activities, Ali ~
sent Abdur-Rahman bin Jurw Tai with a detachment but he was
martyred in the encounter. Hearing this Rib'i bin Kas marched with a
detachment of four thousand and defeated the miscreants. In the
meantime, preparations for the battle of Siffin took a start. Now, the
opportunist Saba clandestinely became a part of Ali's army to take
advantage of the situation.

Kufah becomes the Capital
The most important task before Ali ~ following the battle of Jamal
was to subdue Syria and force Mu'awiyah ~ to take Bai'ah. So, he
considered it necessary to make Kufah his capital. The Kufis
happened to be the main strength of Ali's army. There was another

458

History of Islam

reason behind making Kufah the capital and military center of Islam
because Kufah was nearer to Damascus than Al-Madinah. Kufah
spread its shadow of influence up to the Persian provinces. Umar
Faruq ~ had consolidated Al-Madinah as the power center of Islam,
which was necessary at that time. But events suffered drastic changes
during the days of Ali ~Before Ali~, the Caliphs of Islam ruled from Al-Madinah, the center
of power. They had no role to play as a commander of the Islamic
forces. But Ali ~ under the pressure of circumstances, had to lead his
army to battle and assumed the role of the commander. And this was
one factor that cast injurious effects on his administration.
Something worthy of notice here is that a section of the rioters and
murderers of Uthman ~ had joined Abdullah bin Saba as a result of
his great efforts, and therefore, came to be called the party of
Abdullah bin Saba. A large number of Muslims had become his
followers out of their gullibility but the number of real followers of
Abdullah bin Saba was very small. These few persons were clever
enough to mislead large numbers of people into trusting the sincerity
of their scheme. Thus, they would often change their tools according
to their needs and circumstances. That was the reason why this party
led the rioters to do away with Uthman ~ and his caliphate and a
greater number of them took part in the battle of Jamal.
But when they turned against Ali ~, many among the rioters severed
their relations with the party. They rather sided with Ali ~ and
played a prominent role in strengthening his hand and thus gaining
power and influence in his court. When Ali ~ settled in Kufah, they
became closer and more influential, which in turn made Mu'awiyah's
position stronger. It was because of this that those in favor of taking
Qisas (retaliation) for Uthman's blood, sided with Mu'awiyah ~ in
spite of the superiority of Ali~, which they all knew.

Egypt and Muhammad bin Abu Bakr·~
About the time of Uthman's martyrdom, Muhammad bin Abu Hudaifah
~ had captured the governorship of Egypt by dismissing Abdullah
bin Sa'd ~- However, with his becoming Caliph, Ali~ sent Qais bin

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

459

Sa'd ~ to Egypt as governor of the province. The new governor
reached Egypt along with only seven persons and dismissed
Muhammad bin Abu Hudaifah ~ and took charge as governor of
Egypt. In Egypt also there were men like Yazid bin Al-Harith and
Maslamah bin Mukhallad who declined to take Bai'ah on the plea of
awaiting the settlement of the issue of Qisas (retaliation). However,
they promised silence until a solution was found. Qais bin Sa'd ~
gained popularity and respect in Egypt by virtue of his character and
abilities.
When the battle of Jamal ended and Ali ~ settled in Kufah,
Mu'awiyah ~ anticipated a two-pronged attack on Syria one by Iraq
from the east and one by Egypt from the south. However, Mu'awiyah
~ was not so weak as to be swallowed up easily. He had reason to
grow strong with the passage of time and with the caliphate facing
troubles, he placed his own house in peace and order. Every day he
made himself stronger and he was a power formidable enough to
answer back any challenge. He arranged a daily display of the
bloodstained garments of Uthman ~ and the fingers of Uthman's
wife on the pulpit of the grand mosque of Damascus. People in large
numbers cried aloud and mourned the victims of these atrocities. The
people would never leave the mosque until they had vowed to avenge
the assassination.
Furthermore, a strong Syria was necessary, for it was constantly
under the threat of Roman attack. Mu'awiyah ~ was never found
lacking in inviting and honoring men of letters and arms from all over
Arabia. He utilized every opportunity available to claim his right to
retaliate for the martyrdom of Uthman ~- He had spent the whole
year since the assassination, in making total preparations for the
anticipated danger, while Ali ~ remained surrounded by threats,
challenges, troubles and fighting throughout this period. Even though
the entire world of Islam barring Syria was under the rule of Ali ~,
he never enjoyed such a power and influence as was wielded by
Umar Farug ~- His loyalists were found everywhere in Hijaz,
Yemen, Iraq, Egypt, and Persia but his opponents also had their say.
Thus Ali ~ was not in a position to get the full support and military
aid from any province under his direct rule.

460

History of Islam

The state of affairs with Mu'awiyah • was quite different. He had the
support of the Syrians as a whole. As a matter of war strategy, he
wanted to remove the threat from the Egyptian side because he
dreaded the power and abilities of Qais bin Sa'd • . Fortunately for
him, he soon got an opportunity to eliminate the threat from Egypt.
Mu'awiyah • wrote Qais bin Sa'd ~ to help him for he simply
wanted to avenge the blood of Uthman • . Qais firmly wrote him back
that Ali ~ had no hand in the assassination of Uthman • and so he
should take Bai'ah at Ali's hand like the others, instead of opposing
him.
In the meantime Qais bin Sa'd. wrote a letter to Ali~ advising him
not to put pressure on the people who were keeping silence on the
subject of Bai'ah. Abdullah bin Ja'far ~ suggested to Ali~ to write
Sa'd ~ not to overlook the problem or to leave the people unpunished
if they refused to take Bai'ah. Ali~ wrote him accordingly. But instead
of carrying out the orders of the Caliph, he wrote him again suggesting
him to leave them as they were, for any pressure would make them rise
against the caliphate and join the opponents as well.
As the letter reached Kufah, the emissaries of Ali ~ convinced him
that Qais bin Sa'd ~ must have joined hands with Mu'awiyah ~ -Ali
~ was reluctant to accept their idea and he considered Sa'd ~
qualified and necessary for Egypt. When Mu'awiyah ~ came to know
of these suspicions, he began to praise Qais bin Sa'd ~ openly in his
court. He also commenced telling the people that Qais ~ had come to
his side and had begun to support those demanding Qisas (retaliation).
The spies of Ali ~ gave him the whole account of the new
developments, with the result that he deposed Qais bin Sa'd ~ and
replaced him with Muhammad bin Abu Bakr~- Qais ~ reached AlMadinah shocked and frustrated.
Al-Madinah was without a ruler after Ali • had shifted to Kufah.
Elements supporting and opposing Ali ~ could be found there.
When Qais bin Sa'd ~ reached Al-Madinah, Mu'awiyah ~ sent
Marwan bin Al-Hakam to persuade him to go to Damascus. Qais ~
declined the offer and when he was roughly treated, he left for Kufah.
When he related the whole event to Ali . , the latter expressed
satisfaction and kept him in his company. Hearing this, Mu'awiyah

461

~ wrote to Marwan: "Had you reinforced Ali with an army of one

hundred thousand
joining Ali."

fighters, it would have been better than Qais

Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~, with the assumption of power,
announced to the people to either take Bai'ah or leave the country.
They requested him not to be in a rush and give them a few days to
think and decide. He flatly refused any respite, with the result they
sprang into action to safeguard themselves against the eventuality of
him trying to punish them. The result was that Muhammad bin Abu
Bakr ~ remained entangled with them even after the end of the
battle of Siffin.

Amr bin Al-As ~ was with Mu 1 awiyah ~
Amr bin Al-As~ had conquered Egypt. While the rioters entered AlMadinah and surrounded the house of Uthman ~, he decided to
leave Al-Madinah. He took with him his sons, Abdullah and
Muhammad and settled in Bait Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) . Being there, he
remained in contact with all the developments that took place
following the martyrdom of Uthman ~- When he was informed that
the danger of a large-scale bloody battle hung over the head of the
Muslim Um mah, Amr bin Al-As~ held consultations with his sons
about his role as a peacemaker.
Before the battle of Jamal, four persons had a claim to the caliphate.
One was Ali ~ who had already become the Caliph and a large
number of people had taken Bai'ah at his hands, and the second and
the third being Talhah and Zubair who were killed during the battle
of the Jamal. Now the fourth one left in the field to stake his claim to
the caliphate was Mu'awiyah ~- He had refused to take Bai'ah on the
claim that Ali ~ was made Caliph with the support of the rioters and
the killers of Uthman ~ who were also being patronized by Ali~On the other hand, Ali ~ claimed that in regard to the services to
Islam, proximity and relationship with the Prophet~ and in being
one of the first to embrace Islam, Mu'awiyah ~ was not on par with
him. Both of them had reasons for their claims. In such a confusing
situation Amr bin Al-As~ thought it quite unwise to keep aloof. He

462

History of Islam

d ecided to play his role in helping the two hostile forces reach a
consensus.
He arrived in Damascus and Mu'awiyah ~ welcomed him. He mad e
no delay in telling Mu'awiyah ~ that he was within his rights to
avenge the blood of Uthman ~- At first Mu'awiyah ~ practiced
caution but later he became satisfied towards him and made Amr bin
Al-As~ a member of his government.
Amr bin Al-As ~ then advanced his suggestion to Mu'awiyah ~
that consecutive display of the bloodstained garments and slashed
fingers would reduce the fervor of the people. So it should be put on
display on special occasions. Mu'awiyah ~ liked this suggestion and
so the daily mourning and crying came to an end . Amr bin Al-As~
then let Mu'awiyah ~ know that the battle of Jamal had very much
eroded Ali's military power and a large number of his troops had
already perished. In addition, the wise and influential people of
Basrah had lost their lives in the strife and only the weak masses had
pledged their allegiance to Ali ~ and they would be of little help to
him. Furthermore, the fighting machinery of Ali ~ had been reduced
to disorder because of the large-scale killing of the Muslims on both
sides had dampened their spirits. The appraisal of Amr bin Al-As ~
was not unreasonable, even the Saba sect knew it well.

Preparations for the fighting in Siffin
With his arrival in Kufah, Ali ~ was determined to make
preparations against Syria. Abdullah bin Abbas ~ also left Basrah
with his army. Hearing this, Ali~ too marched to Nukhailah putting
Abu Mas'ud Ansari~ in his place. Abdullah bin Abbas ~ joined Ali
there. Ali ~ then dispatched Ziyad bin Nadr Harithi at the head of
an eight thousand strong vanguard. He also sent Shuraih bin Hani at
the back of Ziyad with four thousand fighters. Ali ~ came to
Mada'in and sent Ma'qal bin Qais with a detachment of three thousand
after putting Sa'd bin Mas'ud Thaqafi in charge of Mada'in. From
Mada'in, Ali ~ reached Raqqah and crossed the Euphrates to meet the
joint forces ofShuraih, Ma'qal and others. When Mu'awiyah ~ came to
know that Ali ~ was marching on Syria, he hurriedly sent Abul-A'war
Sulami at the head of a squadron in the form of vanguard. Ali~ sent

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

463

Ziyad and Shuraih ahead of the vanguard. When these generals entered
the Syrian borders, they were informed that Abul-A'war was heading a
detachment against them. They informed Ali~ of the situation who sent
Ashtar to take charge of the forces and to put Ziyad and Shuraih to the
right and left wings. He also instructed not to attack the Syrians unless
they were attacked by them.
Ashtar acted accordingly. Abul-A'war camped in front of them. Both
camps passed the whole day in silence. By the evening, Abul-A'war
launched an attack on his opponents but they separated after a brief
encounter. The next day, Abul-A'war stepped forward and was faced by
Hashim bin Utbah and they kept fighting until noon. Each of them was
retreating to his camp when Ashtar launched a sudden attack. AbulA'war also responded with his men. The fighting continued until the
darkness of night intervened to stop it.
The next day, Ali ~ appeared on the scene. News also came about
Mu'awiyah's march towards the battlefront. Ali~ stopped fighting
and ordered Ashtar to capture the banks of Euphrates for water. But
Ashtar found to his disappointment that Mu'awiyah ~ had already
captured the water of the Euphrates. When Ali~ became aware of
this, he sent Sa'sa'ah bin Suhan with a letter addressed to Mu'awiyah
~ which, contained: "We would not have started this fight with you
until we heard your grievances and called you to the right path.
However, your men preferred to launch an attack on our troops and
started the aggression. Now we think it fit to first invite you to the
straight path before meeting you in the battlefield. It is quite
unfortunate that you have initiated your war activities by capturing
the water resources and stopped the supply of water to us, with the
result that our troops are under the stress of thirst. It is better to ask
your men not to prevent us from fetching water until the
controversies are peacefully resolved. However, if you want to fight
over the water instead of attaining the main goals, we are ready for
that as well."
Mu'awiyah ~ called an emergency meeting and placed the demand
before his advisers. Abdullah bin Sa'd, the former governor of Egypt
and Walid bin Uqbah spoke against lifting the ban on water so that
they should be left to die without water as they had done with

464

History of Islam

Uthman bin Affan ~. But Amr bin Al-As ~ said pleading against
them, "Stopping the supply of water is not reasonable because many
from your own camp may not bear the tragic deaths of Ali's men
without water and they might join Ali's camp to fight against you
declaring you unfair and stone-hearted." Mu'awiyah ~ announced
not to block the supply of water and the situation that was heading
towards an armed conflict was defused. [The dispute over the water
seems to be incorrect. Euphrates is not a tank or pool that any party
can get hold of it. It is a river thousands of miles in length and each
party could have taken water from its side.]
Following this, both sides kept silent for two days. Parties from Hijaz,
Yemen, Hamadan and other parts of Arabia and Persia joined Ali's
army to make it swell to ninety thousand, while Mu'awiyah ~ was in
command of eighty thousand troops. [Historians differ on the number
of troops. Some have mentioned the same and others have mentioned
differently.]
Ali ~ had given the command of the horsemen of Kufah to Ashtar
and those of Basrah to Sahl bin Hunaif, the infantry of Kufah was
commanded by Ammar bin Yasir and those of Basrah by Qais bin
Sa'd bin Ubadah ~, while Hashim bin Utbah was made the
standard-bearer. Other clans and parties from various provinces were
put under the command of their respective chiefs. In the army of
Mu'awiyah ~' Dhil-Kala' Himyari was put on the right wing, Habib
bin Maslamah on the left and the vanguard was handed over to AbulA 'war Sulami. The cavalry of Damascus was put under the command
of Amr bin Al-As ~ while the infantry was headed by Muslim bin
Uqbah. Other small columns were given to the commanding officers
like Abdur-Rahman bin Khalid, Ubaidullah bin Umar and Bashir bin
Malik Kindi and others.
On the third day, Ali ~ broke his silence and sent Bashir bin Amr bin
Mihsan Ansari, Saeed bin Qais and Shabath bin Rib'i Tamimi to
convince Mu'awiyah ~ to accept obedience and to take Bai'ah of Ali
~. Bashir bin Amr ~ said to Mu 'awiyah, "O Mu 'awiyah, refrain
from creating any rift in the Muslim ranks and avoid bloodshed."
Mu'awiyah ~ retorted, "Have you counseled this to your friend
Ali?" Bashir replied, "He is among the first believers in Islam and a

Second Half of the Riglztly-Cuided Caliphate

465

very close relative of the Prophet~ and has, therefore, more right to
caliphate than all others." Mu'awiyah ~ said, "It is not at all possible
for us to give up our demand for avenging the blood of Uthman."
Thereupon Shabath bin Rib'i said, "O Mu'awiyah, we know very well
your purpose behind the demand for Qisas . You delayed help to
Uthman so that he would be martyred giving you an opportunity to
stake your claim to the caliphate on the pretext of avenging Uthman's
blood. 0 Mu 'awiyah, avoid any conflict with Ali and see reason."
This led to hot exchanges with Mu'awiyah ~ and the deputation
proved fruitless.

First Stage of the Battle of Siffin
When peace talks failed, they came to a clash. But the zeal and fervor
they used to experience in fighting against the disbelievers was absent
because of the ties of friendship and relationship between the
opposing sides. Men from both sides generally wanted to avert the
scourge of battle. Since circumstances had led both the parties to
dictate terms unacceptable to the other side and they couldn't
compromise in achieving their purpose, fighting became inevitable.
However, they tried to avoid all-out fighting. They started with a duel
that lingered on for a few days. A little later the rage for fighting
increased and with it, the chiefs of small parties began to face each
other one by one. Thus the dual changed into clashes between small
parties, while the armies on both sides remained silent spectators.
This exercise continued for about a month .
This period may be considered as the first stage of the battle of Siffin.
With the beginning of the month of Muharram, both the parties had a
one-month respite and fighting was totally stopped. The contacts and
peace talks were started again. Men on both sides desired t.uccess for
the peace talks and had an aversion to war except the Saba party who
had vested interests. Success of the peace talks could be virtually a
deathblow to their nefarious plans. Thus they were leaving no stone
unturned in keeping both sides at odds. They were doing all within
their power to aggravate the situation.
Ali ~ was in a fix. He could neither quit the caliphate nor punish the
rioters and assassins of Uthman ~- To punish a mighty commander

466

History of Islam

like Malik Ashtar, a governor like Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ and a
respected Companion like Ammar bin Yasir ~ meant antagonizing
the Egyptian and Kufi forces. Moreover, the role of rioters in the
assassination of Uthman ~ could not be exactly determined for lack
of definite witnesses. On the other hand, Ali~ was more deserving
of the caliphate by all standards.
Mu'awiyah ~ considered himself equally important by virtue of
being a distinguished personality of Makkah, the son of Abu Sufyan
~ , commander-in-chief of the huge Makkan armies in the battles of
Uhud and Ahzab (Confederates), commander who achieved great
victories against the Romans since the beginning of the caliphate,
great administer who governed Egypt very efficiently, brother of a
wife of the Prophet ;i and a scribe of the Revelation. He was bound
with Uthman ~ in ancestral ties and he therefore, considered himself
within his rights to avenge the blood of Uthman ~- It was to him
highly improper and unreasonable to evade Qisas (retaliation) for the
murder of such a grave nature by merely declaring it doubtful.
The explanation given by Ali ~ was neither understandable nor
worth understanding to him. The revolt of Talhah ~ and Zubair ~,
the many Companions in Al-Madinah who declined to take Bai'ah and
the support received from Amr bin Al-As ~ had fortified his
conviction and determination in his stand. The leadership on both
sides would be forced to restore peace and amity if advisors,
supporters and commanding officers played their roles positively.
The Muharram cessation of fighting was a golden opportunity to
implement the peace proposal but the Saba party was active enough
to sabotage the peace mission and they were successful in their
treachery.

Another Peace Effort during Muharram
At some date in Muharram of 37 AH, Ali~ sent a peace commission
to Mu'awiyah ~ to initiate talks. It consisted of Adi bin Hatim, Zaid
bin Qais, Ziyad bin Khasafah, and Shabath bin Rib'i. Initiating the
peace talks, Adi bin Hatim ~ said after praising Allah the Almighty,
"O Mu'awiyah, your recognition and obedience to Ali will bring
peace to Muslims as a whole. None has rejected the call to take Bai'ah

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

467

except you and your friends. If you still insist on deviating from the
path of righteousness, I am afraid, you will invite the same ordeal, the
people of Jamal faced ." Cutting short the speech of Adi, Mu'awiyah
~ said, "O Adi! Have you come here on peace mission or on a war
mission? Don't you know I am the grandson of Harb, I fear not
fighting? Since you too are among the assassins of Uthman, Allah the
Almighty will put you to death."
Following this, Yazid bin Qais said, "We have come as emissaries and
so it is not our mission to counsel you. Nevertheless, we should make
an all-out endeavor to bring peace and unity to the Muslims and
remove disunity." Saying this, he began to state the excellence of Ali
~ and his worthiness of being the Caliph of Islam. In reply to his
statement, Mu'awiyah ~ said, "How do you call me to join a party
when I, too, have a party of Muslims with me. I don't consider your
friend worthy of the caliphate for he assassinated our Caliph and
sheltered the assassins. Peace may be established only when the
assassins of Uthman are handed over to us." Interrupting the
statement, Shabath bin Rib'i spoke out, "O Mu'awiyah! Will you kill
Ammar bin Yasir?" Mu'awiyah ~ replied, "What can prevent me
from killing Ammar? I shall surely kill him as a retaliation for the
blood of Uthman's slave." Shabath bin Rib'i firmly said, "You will
never be able to kill him unless you meet your death." Mu'awiyah ~
answered back, "You are to meet your death first. " After such hot
exchanges, the commission left without any success.

The Speech of Ali ~
Mu 'awiyah ~ then sent a similar commission to Ali ~ , which
included Habib bin Maslamah, Shurahbil bin As-Samt, and Ma'n bin
Yazid. Initiating the talk, Habib bin Maslamah said to Ali ~,
"Uthman was the rightful Caliph. He managed the affairs under the
guidelines set by the Book and the Sunnah. But his life appeared
detestable and so you killed him; if not, you should hand over the
assassins to us and relinquish the caliphate at once giving an
opportunity to the people at large to choose a caliph according to their
will." Hearing this, Ali ~ grew furious and chided him saying, "You
should keep quite. You have no right to make such a statement

468

History of Islam

concerning the caliphate." Thereupon Habib bin Maslamah retorted,
"You are to see me in a state which will make you become
unpleasant," meaning thereby, the sword will decide the matter. Ali
~ angrily said, "Go and do whatever you like." Saying this, Ali~
got up and spoke after praising Allah the Almighty, describing the
purpose behind the advent of the Prophet ~ and eulogizing the
caliphate of the two former Righteous Caliphs: "I found them
performing their duties correctly. So, I held myself back from
meddling in their affairs. They then chose Uthman as Caliph. His style
of functioning caused dissatisfaction among the people and they
killed him. Following that, they requested me to accept their Bai'ah,
which I granted. But Talhah and Zubair violated their pledge and
Mu'awiyah opposed me, even though he is not among the first to
embrace Islam like me. I wonder at your obedience to him although I
call you towards the Book and the Sunnah and the Pillars of Faith."
Hearing his speech, Shurahbil bin As-Samt said, "Do you not bear
witness that Uthman was oppressively martyred?" Ali~ replied, "I
hold Uthman neither oppressed nor oppressor." Having heard this,
they got up saying, "We rather abhor one who evades holding
Uthman a victim. It is all the same for such people whether they are
asked to see wisdom or not." No considerable peace efforts were
made after the failure of that mission.

One Week of the Battle of Siffin
At the end of Muharram 37 AH, Ali ~ issued orders to his army that
a decisive battle would begin from the first of the month of Safar.
Along with this he added that the fleeing opponents will neither be
chased nor killed; nor the goods of the wounded be taken, nor their
dead bodies mutilated, nor the women be put to excesses even if they
call bad names. Such orders were also issued from the other side.
Thus the battle broke out on the first morning in Safar. The people of
Kufah advanced under the command of Ashtar, and the Syrians
headed by Habib bin Masalamah, faced one another. The battle
continued until evening but remained indecisive.
The next day, Hashim bin Utbah came out at the head of a column of
cavalry and infantry from the side of Ali~, and Abul-A'war Sulami

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

469

on behalf of Mu'awiyah • . But the daylong bloody battle produced
no results. On the third day, Ammar bin Yasir ~ from Ali's camp,
and Amr bin Al-As~ from that of Mu'awiyah ~ faced each other. It
was more severe an encounter in comparison to previous ones.
Ammar bin Ya.sir~ launched such a fierce attack that Amr bin Al-As
~ had to fall back. But the day, however, went without any result.
On the fourth day, Ubaidullah bin Umar ~ led the column from
Mu'awiyah's side and Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyah, the son of Ali
~ from Ali's side but the battle remained indecisive. By the evening,
Ubaidullah bin Umar ~ challenged Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyah to
a duel, which he accepted, but Ali~ rushed to the spot and brought
Muhammad back, Ubaidullah ~ also went back to his camp.
The fifth day saw Walid bin Uqbah coming out from Ali's camp, and
Abdullah bin Abbas ~ from Mu'awiyah's side, and fought the whole
day, while the sixth day, Malik Ashtar and Habib bin Maslamah came
out again for a decisive battle but it was an exercise in futility. On the
seventh day, Ali ~ and Mu'awiyah ~ led their armies against one
another but no body could win the day.
This weeklong battle failed to produce any result because in number
and art of warfare and valor both sides were almost equal. However,
the enemy camp of Saba rejoiced at the bloodbath of the Muslims on
both sides. Although the week proved ill-fated, more ominous days
were to come.

The Last Two Days of the Battle of Siffin
After a week of severe battles, both the armies got ready for a decisive
battle. On Safar 8, 37 AH, Ali~ launched his assault on Mu'awiyah's
army. Ali ~ occupied a place in the center where the notables of
Kufah, Basrah, Al-Madinah and from Banu Khuza'ah and Banu
Kinanah had their presence. Abdullah bin Budail bin Warqa Khuza'i
was put on the right wing and Abdullah on the left. Every clan had its
fixed place, separate standard and leading officer. Ammar bin Yasir ~
had been given charge of the people singing martial songs and reciting
the Qur'an. Qais bin Sa'd ~ and Abdullah bin Yazid were also put on
the same job.

470

History of Islam

Mu'awiyah ~ , on the other hand, took Bai'ah (pledges) for death in
his camp. He gave the right wing of his army to Ubaidullah bin Umar
• and left to Habib bin Maslamah. Ali's right wing first made the
advance and Abdullah bin Budail Khuza'i attacked the left wing of
Mu'awiyah's army led by Habib bin Maslamah. Under the hard
pressure of Abdullah, Habib's cavalry was forced to retreat until it
reached the spot where, Mu'awiyah ~ with his men, had taken the
pledge for death. With an eye on the setback of his right wing,
Mu'awiyah ~ ordered his men to attack. The attack was so massive
that Abdullah bin Budail was left with only two hundred fifty men
while all others fled to take shelter behind Ali ~- In view of the
ordeal suffered by his right wing, Ali ~ sent Sahl bin Hunaif as the
commanding officer of the Madinites to reinforce and protect Abdullah
bin Budail. But in a short while Budail succumbed to death along with
his party.
The left wing also tasted defeat at the hands of the Syrian force. None
but the Rabi'ah tribe fought with courage and firmness. All others fled
the battlefield. With this scenario, Ali~ sent his sons, Hasan, Husain
and Muhammad to reinforce the Rabi 'ah tribe so that they were not
routed. He then asked Ashtar to call the right wing and put them to
shame or force them to avoid escape. Ali. himself made an advance
towards the left wing and began to measure his sword with the
enemy. The presence of Ali ~ produced courage in the Rabi'ah tribe
whose charge become more forceful.
When Ahmar, the slave of Abu Sufyan • saw Ali • in action, he
made an attempt on his life but Ali's slave Kaisan engaged him but
was killed in the encounter. With the killing of his slave, Ali •
launched an assault on Ahmar and in a state of utmost fury , he lifted
him up and knocked him down so violently that his both hands
turned useless. The Syrian army attempted an attack on Ali ~ but the
people of Rabi'ah stood in the way.
Ashtar, on the other hand, upheld the right wing. Thus the chance of
success, which was, at one stage, slipping out of the hands of Ali ~
returned to an equilibrium. Both sides were fighting with almost equal
valor and firmness . By afternoon, Malik Ashtar pushed back the left
wing of Mu'awiyah ~- But the cavalry of Mu'awiyah ~' which had

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

471

taken an oath for death, came to the rescue of the retreating column
and pushed Ali's right wing far behind. Now Abdullah bin Husain, the
comrade of Ammar bin Yasir ~, came forward with a martial song on
his lips while Uqbah bin Hadid Numairi came from the opposite camp
and was killed. In the wake of his death the Syrian army made a
massive attack which was sustained by Ali's troops with firmness
despite an initial setback. Ali~ came with a column on the left wing to
the rescue of the right wing and a pitched battle was fought. Dhul-Kala'
Himyari and Ubaidullah bin Umar ~ launched such a forceful attack
on the left wing of Ali's troops that even the Rabi'ah tribe could not
withstand the onslaught, and a large number of fighters lost their lives.
Following this disaster of the left wing, Abdul-Qais stepped forward
and lent support to the Rabi'ah tribe and checked the advancement of
the Syrian troops. Timely reinforcements revived the left wing and both
Dhul-Kala' Himyari and Ubaidullah bin Umar ~ were killed.
In short, the right and left wings of both the armies kept fighting from
morning to evening, but the hearts of both sides were steady. At last,
Ammar bin Yasir ~ moved through the army of Ali ~ calling out,
"Whoever has a desire to gain the Pleasure of Allah the Almighty, and
has no wish to go back to his possessions and children should join
me." A large number of the army responded to his call and vowed to
fight to the finish. At the end, he came to Hashim bin Utbah, the
standard-bearer of Ali ~, he took him with his dedicated men and
launched such a massive attack that Amr bin Al-As~ could barely
withstand it with much difficulty.
At last, Ammar ~ was killed. The news of Ammar bin Yasir's death
saddened Ali ~- The Syrian Army too was aroused to fight
forcefully. The battle air was filled with the rattling sound of swords
and spears and loud voices of martial songs. This was the night of
Friday, it is known as Lailat-ul-Harir. Owais Qarni was also martyred
in the same night. Ali ~ was running through the battleground with
lighting speed directing the right wing then guiding the left and at
times crossing swords with the Syrians. Abdullah bin Abbas ~ was
heading the left wing while Ashtar was in charge of the right one.
Mu'awiyah ~ was also fighting with Amr bin Al-As~ and the other
chiefs. The night passed in fierce fighting but with no outcome.

472

History of Islam

Ali ~ once, piercing through the Syrian army, reached very near to
Mu'awiyah ~ at the head of twelve thousand troops and threw a
challenge for a duel, for it was to him better than the large-scale
massacre on both sides. Hearing the call, Amr bin AI-As ~ told
Mu'awiyah ~ that the proposal of Ali ~ was reasonable and he
should go for a duel. "Why do you not like this for yourself? Don't
you know that the one who goes to fight with Ali doesn't came back
alive?" Mu'awiyah .tk, uttered bitterly. He then added with a laugh,
"You, perhaps, want me to go for a duel so that I am killed and you
become the ruler of Syria ." Ali~ received no reply and came back
with no result.
Thirty hours of continuous fighting took a toll of seventy thousand
Muslim fighters from both sides. Such a clash of Muslim forces was a
terrible catastrophe. Seventy thousand valiant Muslim fighters could
have conquered the whole world. With the decline of noon, Malik
Ashtar handed over the charge of his contingent to Haiyan bin
Haudhah and took a squadron of cavalry and stirred the soldiers to
fight to the finish. Although the battle was equally balanced, more
than half of the troops on the Syrian side had lost their lives. Now,
Mu'awiyah ~ had only thirty-five thousand fighters out of eighty
thousand on his side. Ali .tk, had, on the other hand, lost twenty to
twenty-five thousand soldiers while about sixty thousand fighters
were still ready to fight under his command. Ali~ had with him
double the number of fighters as Mu'awiyah's troops. [This analysis
seems to be unrealistic, Tabari and Baihaqi mention the number of
martyrs on the Ali's side to be double of Mu'awiyah's. Forty thousand
men from Ali's army and twenty thousand from Mu 'awiyah's army
were killed. (Al-Biddyah wan-Nihayah, 7 /244).]
In such a state, Ali~ had an opportunity to separate a portion of his
troops to launch a heavy assault on the Syrians while keeping them
engaged from the other side. Malik Ashtar made a tremendous attack
with his cavalry and reached the heart of enemy pushing and
smashing the Syrians. When Ali ~ saw his cavalry making inroads
into enemy's heart, he started sending reinforcements after
reinforcements to strengthen the attack. His strategy worked. The
standard-bearer of the Syrian Army was killed by Ashtar.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

473

Now the scene of carnage was near the camp of Mu'awiyah ~ and
Amr bin Al-As ~- Ashtar's dashing charge broke the right and left
wings and both sides shrank into fighting in a small circle leaving no
chance for the opponents to enforce their strength. Large-scale killings
including that of the standard-bearer had terribly frightened the
Mu'awiyah camp whose defeat was now imminent. In such a crucial
and chaotic stage, Amr bin Al-As ~ salvaged their position with a
novel device.

The End of the Battle
At this juncture, Amr bin Al-As~ counselled Mu'awiyah ~ to order
his men to raise the Qur'an high on the point of their spears crying
aloud: "Between you and us is the Book of Allah." The Syrians began
to say that they bowed down to the verdict of the Qur'an. Someone
was heard saying, "Muslims! we were fighting in the way of Faith;
come on and obey the judgement of the Qur'an and make peace."
Some others called out, "O people! Who will fight the Romans if the
Syrians are destroyed, and who will face the eastern invaders if the
Iraqis are ruined?" When Ali's men witnessed the Qur'an raised with
the spears, they stopped fighting at once. Abdullah bin Abbas ~
remarked at the new developments: "It was fighting until now but
this is the beginning of cheating." Ali ~ tried to make his men
understand not to fall short of carrying their mission to its logical end,
for the victory was not far away. However, as the people had been
completely exhausted by continuous fighting, they found this an
opportunity from providence to stop fighting without delay.
Moreover, the fierce and bloody fighting that was still going hid the
fact that victory was within reach. The nearness of victory was visible
only to Ali~ and his generals and officers and had not yet come into
the view of the fighters' sight so they were not in favor of fighting
further.
Ashtar was sure of his victory and was in full command of the
situation, it seemed unreasonable and illogical to call him back from
the battlefront. It was tantamount to undoing of all his efforts and
sacrifices. But fighters including the hypocrites of Saba party
surrounded Ali ~ on all sides to stop fighting and to recall Ashtar.

474

History of Islam

Ali ~ was still undecided when a strong threat of internal fighting
changed his mind and he called Ashtar back. They threatened him
with the consequences of Uthman ~- In response to the menacing
situation, Ali ~ was compelled to issue emergency orders for Ashtar
to come back at once as the door of a series of problems was now
thrown open. Ashtar called off the fighting, but very reluctantly.
[These details about the last part of the Siffin Battle, especially the
complete submission of Syrian army, and the raising of the Qur'an
on the spears, are false fabrications of Shiite narrations while the
actual events testify differently:
The Prophet ~ had directed Ali ~"' and Fatimah ~ to mention
Sublz§n Allah, Al-hamdu lillah and Allahu Akbar, thirty-three times
each while going to sleep. The Prophet~ told this act better than
getting a slave. Ali ~ told that he never discontinued this act.
When he was asked whether he continued this act even on the
night of Siffin, he replied that even that night he performed it.
(Bukhari 5362, Fath Al-Bari 9/506). Some other narrations also
strengthen this fact. As these mentions are recited at the time of
sleep, it is proved that the fight was stopped during this night of
Siffin and people got the chance of taking a rest or sleep.
In Sahih Al-Bukhari, the Book of Commentary (S{irat Al-Fath), there
is a narration about this event. The first part of it is not so clear, but
in Musnad Ahmad (3/ 485) and An-Nasa'f (2/306), this event is welldescribed with the reference of Sahih Al-Bukhari. According to the
wording of Musnad Ahmad, Habib bin Abu Thabit said: I went to
Abu Wa'il, he said, "We were in Siffin, when the fight with Syrians
grew fierce, Amr said to Mu'awiyah: 'Send the Scripture (Qur'an)
to Ali, and call him towards the Book of Allah, he cannot refuse it
to you.' So, a man took Qur'an to him and said, 'Between us and
you, this is the Book of Allah.' Then he recited the Verse which
accuses the people of the Scriptures: 'Have you not seen those who
have been given a portion of the Scripture? They are being invited
to the Book of Allah to settle their dispute, then a party of them
turns c1way, and they are averse.' (V.3:23). On this Ali said, 'We are
more entitled to it than you.' (Thus he at once agreed to make the
Book of Allah their judge, and stopped fighting . Upon this) some
distinguished persons said (who became Khawarij later): 'O Chief

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

475

of the believers, what we have to see of them now? Should we not
go with our swords until Allah decides between us?' On this Sahl
bin Hunaif said : 'O people, blame yourselves. We have seen
ourselves on the day of Hudaibiyah . If there was a possibility of
fi ght, we would have fou ght. ' (A narration of Bukhari says: 'If I
could have resisted the order of .the Prophet ~' I would have done
that. ' It means that the order of Allah and His Messenger is to be
obeyed, and there is no other way. Here also the Book of Allah is
accepted as judge, so no other way out)."
Many points are known from this narration:
L The proposal presented by Amr bin Al-As~ to make the Qur'an
judge was not to cheat the Iraqi people but to stop Muslims
indulging in more bloodshed and destroying themselves.
2. This proposa l was not presented in the way that the people
while fightin g, unexpectedly produced Qur'an from somewhere in
their clothes, and raised them on the spears. The Muslim fighters
don't keep the Qur'an with them in this way. Actually a man took
the Qur' iin to Ali ~':"·· Same is the wording of Musnad Ahmad and
An-Nnsa'f. It is stated in Daraqutni also that a man took the Qur'iin
to Ali ~>s. So, this was done in the most suitable diplomatic way.
3. Ali '-'i~ had no t termed the proposa l as chea ting or fraud , neither
his army had forced him to accept the proposal. But Ali ~ ' on his
own, had accepted it as soon as it was brought forward . He not
only accepted it without any delay or any argument but he praised
it to be the suitable and timely proposal, and told that he was more
entitled to act upon it than Mu'awiyah ~4. It was also not the case tha t the army, especially the learned
people had forced Ali~ to accept the proposal, as is m entioned in
general narratives, but contrary to it, the most distinguished
persons of his army came to him w ith swords in their hand s and
asked his permission to fight. But Ali ~ didn't give them
permission. Even Sahl bin Hunaif, the right hand of Ali ~'
explained the army that the Book of Allah has been made judge in
this matter, so nothing else can be adopted nor any opinion can be
considered. He gave the reference of the Hudaibiyah Treaty in this
regard .

5. When this narration of Musnad Ahmad and An-Nasa'f is
considered with its full context, it becomes clear enough that at the
time of sending the proposal, no fighting was going on. But both
the parties were ready to begin the fight. It means that the fighting
had stopped the night before, and after the day appeared, both
parties were making their preparations that the proposal was made
by Amr bin AI-As ~ to Mu'awiyah ~ to save the Muslims from
further destruction. Mu'awiyah ~ sent a man to Ali~ with the
proposal and Ali ~ at once accepted it to end the fight. He had
said before that he would not fight until there is a justification, and
now there was no justice greater than the Book of Allah. The
second party had itself asked to accept it, and so there was no
room for further fighting .]
Ali ~ informed Ashtar of the reason for his recall. Expressing deep grief,
Ashtar said addressing the people, "O the people of Iraq, you were
entrapped by delusions when you were about to overpower the Syrians."
But the people were so much overwhelmed with fervor against fighting
that they made an attempt to attack Ashtar but held back when Ali~
intervened. After a while Ash'ath bin Qais stepped forward and
submitted to Ali~, "As now the battle has come to a halt and the people
have accepted the Qur'an as an arbitrator, will you permit me to contact
Mu'awiyah to know his mind." Ali~ acceded to his request. He went to
Mu'awiyah ~ and said, "What was your intention behind raising the
Qur'an upon the spears?" He said in reply, "Both of us should tum to the
Command of Allah and His Messenger. Now two persons, one from each
side, should be appointed to examine and decide the matter under oath
and both sides should follow their decision."
Having heard this, Ash'ath came back and related to Ali~ what he
had heard. The people around Ali 4, hurried to accept the proposal.
When Mu'awiyah ~ was asked about the man to represent his side,
he named Amr bin Al-As 4,. Ali 4, named Abdullah bin Abbas ~But the proposal was rejected on the plea that Abdullah was his
relative. They demanded a neutral person. When Ali 4, left the
matter to them, they named Abu Musa Ash'ari ~- But Ali ~
expressed his reluctance declaring him unauthentic. [This attitude
related to Ali~ is absolutely baseless.]

However, he yielded to their constant insistence and pressure. The
deliberations were still on when Amr bin Al-As~ turned up to make
out the declaration under oath.

Making out the Documentation and the Return
Amr bin Al-As ~ requested Ali ~ to allow him to take down the
document. Ali ~ had him to write down the following:
"This declaration between Ali bin Abu Talib and Mu'awiyah bin Abu
Sufyan declares that Ali bin Abu Talib has appointed an arbitrator on
behalf of the people of Kufah and all those supporting him and,
similarly, Mu'awiyah bin Sufyan has appointed an arbitrator on
behalf of all who follow him. We, holding the Book of Allah the
Almighty and His Order as judge, declare that both of us will follow
nothing but the injunctions of Allah and His Book. We abide by the
rules of the Qur'an from Al-Hamd to Al-Nas and declare to follow
what is permitted and hold back from what is forbidd en. The two
appointed arbitrators are Abu Musa Abdullah bin Qais Ash'ari and
Amr bin Al-As. They will give a decision according to the dictates of
the Qur'an otherwise in accordance with the Sunnah if the Qur'an is
found silent over the issue."
Following this, the arbitrators Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ and Amr bin AlAs ~ were asked to declare that they would decide the matter
according to the Book of Allah and Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah
:i and would not allow the Muslim Ummah to become the victim of
war, disruption and disunity. Afterwards, the arbitrators were given a
period of six months to examine the case and give their judgment at
that time at Adhruh near Daumat Al-Jandal located between Kufah
and Damascus. It was also decided that Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ while
coming from Kufah, would have with him four hundred men sent by
Ali ~ and Amr bin Al-As ~, coming from Damascus, also would
have an equal number from Mu'awiyah ~. Those eight hundred men
will act as representatives of the Muslims as a whole.
Following this, both Ali ~ and Mu'awiyah ~ asked their men to
declare on oath that they would not target the lives and properties of the
mediators, which was signed by Ash'ath bin Qais, Sa'd bin Qais

bin Adi Kindi, Abdullah bin At-Tufail Al-Amiri, Uqbah bin Ziyad
Hadrami, Yazid bin Tajhafah Tamimi, Malik bin Kab Hamadani on
behalf of Ali ~ as witnesses and guarantors while Abul-A'war, Habib
bin Maslamah, Zamil bin Amr Al-Udhri, Hamzah bin Malik Hamadani,
Abdur-Rahman bin Khalid Makhzumi, Subai' bin Yazid Ansari, Utbah
bin Abu Sufyan, Yazid bin Al-Hur Absi put their signatures for
Mu'awiyah's side.
On being finalized , one copy of the declaration was given each to Abu
Musa Ash'ari ~ and Amr bin Al-As ~ - Malik Ashtar refused to sign
the document. Four days elapsed in giving the declaration a final
shape and it was handed over to the arbitrators on Safar 13. Following
this, the two armies moved back towards Kufah and Damascus
respectively. Mu'awiyah ~ reached Damascus safe and sound but
Ali ~ had to face a new trouble.

Trouble caused by the Khawarij
When Ali ~ decided to leave the battlefield of Siffin on Safar 13, 37
AH, some people approached him and asked him to attack the Syrian
army instead of going back to Kufah. "How can I commit a breach of
promise after writing the declaration? We have now to wait until the
month of Ramadan without even thinking of war after attaining
peace," Ali ~ firmly said . Although they went away, they started
seeking support of the people against Ali~ and attempted to form
separate groups. Ali ~ left Kufah but a clash of opinions dominated the
atmosphere throughout. Even though Ali ~ worked hard to pacify
the situation, it was in vain, for a section was engaged in fanning the
fire of discord. The united front of Ali's army was now divided into
scores of groups creating dissension and giving rise to chaos and
disorder. And from a war of words they had come down to hitting
and thrashing each other.
Of all the groups, two were strong, one completely opposing Ali ~
and another one eulogizing him beyond all limits in response and in
competition with the other group. Thus, the first group came to be
called the Khawarij and the second one was the Shiite. It is quite
interesting that the Khawarij group was formed under the leadership

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

479

of those who had forced Ali ~ to call Malik Ashtar back threatening
him with the consequences of Uthman ~ - Although Ali ~
repeatedly reminded them of their past activities in forcing him to
stop fighting and bring peace to the people, but they paid no attention
to his claim. At last, twelve thousand men separated themselves from
Ali's army and moved towards Haraura' .
It was the group of the Khawarij. It settled in Haraura' and set

Abdullah bin Al-Kawa the Imam of the prayers and Shabath bin Rib'i
the commander. Shabath bin Rib'i was the same person whom Ali~
had twice sent to Mu'awiyah ~ as the member of the peace
commission and on both occasions his provocative words worsened
the possibility for a peaceful solution and the talks ended in failure.
After establishing their administration in Haraura', the insurgents
now declared: "Bai'ah is meant for Allah the Almighty Alone. It is our
duty to enjoin the good on people of the land and forbid the evil.
There is no caliph or ruler in Islam. After gaining victory, all matters
must be settled by mutual consultation of the Muslims and their
majority should decide all issues. Both Ali and Mu'awiyah are at
fault."
When Ali ~ came to know of the uprisings of the Khawarij, he
observed utmost patience. On reaching Kufah, Ali~ consoled the
relatives of those who had laid down their lives in Siffin and declared
those killed as martyred. He then sent Abdullah bin Abbas ~ to the
Khawarij to pacify them and put them on the right path. But they
were contentious on all issues and rejected the pleas of Abdullah bin
Abbas ~.
In the meantime Ali* himself went there. He first visited the camp
of Yazid bin Qais because he had more influence on them. He first
offered two Rak'at Salat (prayer) and then appointed Yazid bin Qais
the governor of Isfahan and Rey. He then came to the assembly where
Abdullah bin Abbas ~ was carrying on arguments with them and
said, "Who among you is most wise and the leader of the group?"
They replied, "Abdullah bin Al-Kawa." Ali ~ then said turning to
Abdullah, 'You people had pledged your allegiance to me, then what
is the reason behind your turning away after taking Bai'ah? " He
replied, "It is because of your undue immovability."

480

History of Islam

Ali ~ said, "By Allah! I was not in favor of stopping the battle. But
you people forced me to do so. Nevertheless, l have let both the
arbitrators decide the issue according to the dictates of the Qur'an.
Thus if they give a verdict according to the Qur'a n, there is no harm
in accepting this; if it is against the Qur'an, I shall reject it outright."
Having heard this, the Khawarij said, "Mu'awiyah revolted and
committed the crime of killing the Muslims and so the appointment of
arbitrators in this matter is not justified. According to clear injunctions
of the Qur'an he is liable to be killed." Ali J'..k, said, "I have not
appointed anybody as arbitrator; the real arbitrator is the Qur'an by
all means and the men are appointed merely to give judgment
according to the Book." The Khawarij then said, "What was the need
of allotting six-months for the job?" Ali ~ replied, "Maybe the
dissenting voices among the Muslims will subside by then." The
Khawarij then kept silent. Ali ~ then asked them politely and
affectionately, "Come let us go to Kufah and stay there during these
six months, your mounts and beasts of burden will grow fat and
strong enough to resume fighting against the enemy." Hearing this,
they agreed and entered Basrah along with Ali~ and began to await
the decision of the arbitrators. Ali ~ then sent Abdullah bin Abbas
~ to Basrah to perform his job as governor.

The Decision of the Arbitrators at Adhruh
When the end of the six-month period drew near, Ali ~ sent for
Abdullah bin Abbas ~ from Basrah . He then appointed Shuraih bin
Hani Al-Harithi in charge of four hundred men and Abdullah bin
Abbas ~ to lead the prayers. They were then sent to Adhruh along
with Abu Musa Ash'ari ~- Similarly, Mu'awiyah ~ also sent Amr
bin Al-As ~ at the head of four hundred men. Some influential men
from Makkah and Al-Madinah were also invited to join the peace
efforts and they could not refuse to avail the opportunity of bringing
the warring Muslims together and stopping the carnage. Several men
including Abdullah bin Umar, Abdullah bin Zubair and Sa 'd bin
Waqqas ~t, came to Adhruh. The people were very curious to know
the decision but the arbitrators held it back because they had to
exchange views before making any announcement.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

481

On the eve of the departure of Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ from Kufah to
Adhruh, Hurqus bin Zuhair called on Ali ~ on behalf of the
Khawarij and submitted, "You have committed a blunder by
accepting the arbitrator to give the decision in the matter. There is still
time for you to back out from your promise and march on to attack
your enemy. We stand by you." Ali ~ said, "I cannot commit a
breach of trust." This was the same Hurqus bin Zuhair who had
headed the rioters against Uthman ~ and had now joined hands with
the Khawarij.
Since Abu Musa's departure, Ali~ would write letters to him daily
without fail; and Mu'awiyah ~ too did the same, for the issue was
too delicate and needed their undivided attention. Ali ~ sent his
letters and messages in the name of Abdullah bin Abbas~ while
Mu'awiyah ~ addressed them to Amr bin Al-As ~- But the two
addresses had different working conditions. Mu'awiyah's men were
too disciplined to ask anything about the letters while Abdullah bin
Abbas ~ did not maintain secrecy because his men would sit around
him and inquired about the contents of all the letters sent by Ali~They would grow angry when he kept anything secret. Gradually
they turned against him and began to criticize him openly.
When Abdullah bin Umar, Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr, Abdullah
bin Zubair, Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith, Abdur-Rahman bin Abd
Yaghuth Zuhri, Abu Jahm bin Hudhaifah, Mughirah bin Shu'bah, and
Sa'd bin Waqqas ~ and others reached Adhruh, a meeting of
distinguished persons was convened to look into the matter. Amr bin
Al-As ~ had Abu Musa ~ admit that Uthman bin Affan ~ was put
to death as an innocent man. Amr bin Al-As~ also had him to admit
that on account of common ancestry, Mu'awiyah ~ was within his
rights to claim Qisiis (retaliation) of Uthman ~- These two issues
were never denied by Abu Musa ~ and he accepted both
unreluctantly.
Following this, Amr bin Al-As~ raised the issue of the caliphate and
said: "Mu'awiyah belongs to a noble and renowned family of the
Quraish. He is the brother of Umm Habibah, the wife of the Prophet
~ and the scribe of the revealed words."

482

History of Islam

Having heard all this, Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ raised his objection. He
said, "Although I don't deny the excellence of Mu'awiyah and how he
was entrusted with the responsibility of ruling the Muslims in the
presence of Ali and other such men and he commands high respect
for all these qualities, Ali still has a far greater right. He is the closest
to the Prophet ii by the ties of relationship; he belongs to a very noble
family and is reckoned among the chiefs of the Quraish. He also
enjoys a distinct place in regard to learning, bravery, and piety."
Amr bin AI-As ~ argued, "Mu'awiyah is superior in administrative
ability and political vision." Abu Musa ~ replied, "These things are
not worthy of consideration in comparison to piety and honesty." After
such exchanges, Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ suggested that both Ali ~ and
Mu'awiyah ~ be deposed and Abdullah bin Umar ~ be chosen as
caliph. Abdullah bin Umar ~, who was present in the meeting, said in
a loud voice, "I don't agree to this suggestion." Amr bin Al-As ~ said
to Abu Musa ~, "Why don' t you choose my son, Abdullah?" Abu
Musa ~ said, "Well, your son is very pious no doubt but you have put
him to a great trial by plunging him into the battle."
Such inconclusive talks went on for sometime. After this, Amr bin AlAs ~ put forward his proposal and said, "Since hostile relations
between Ali~ and Mu'awiyah ~ have brought untold miseries and
sufferings to the Muslims as a whole, it is advisable that both should
be deposed. Then the Muslims should choose a new caliph
unanimously or by a majority opinion. With this suggestion agreed
upon between the two, it was decided that the announcement should
be made at the opening in front of the general assembly. They,
however, anticipated rejection of the proposal by both Ali~ and
Mu'awiyah ~ - Nevertheless, a call was sounded for the people to
assemble which they did with the utmost curiosity. Both the
arbitrators then appeared on the scene.

The Verdict
Amr bin Al-As * asked Abu Musa Ash'ari * to announce the decision
taken by them. Abu Musa ~ ascended the pulpit and said addressing
the people: "People! After much deliberation we could reach one and
only one decision. I am sure this verdict will lead the Muslims as a

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

483

whole to peace and unity. Both Amr bin Al-As and I have decided to
depose both Ali and Mu'awiyah giving you the right to chose anybody
as your caliph."
The entire congregation heard it and Abu Musa ~ descended. Now
Amr bin Al-As• mounted the pulpit and said to the people: "All of
you be witness that Abu Musa had deposed his friend Ali. But I,
however, do not depose Mu'awiyah and keep him at his place for he
is the successor of the brutally martyred Caliph and has the right to
succeed him."
Had Amr bin Al-As ~ lent total support to the decision announced
by Abu Musa ~ without saying anything in support of Mu'awiyah ~'
the judgment would not have suffered such a disgrace and setback.
There may be some weakness in the statement of Abu Musa~ but it
was decidedly above dishonesty and manipulation and would not have
set eight hundred Muslims against it. Even though they were given
the right to choose a new caliph, but he could not have been stronger
than Ali ~ or Mu'awiyah ~- Furthermore, a third man as a caliph
could have aggravated the already tense situation that was filled with
bitterness and bad blood.
In truth, Mu'awiyah• was not in favor of peace with Ali ~,
otherwise he would have proposed arbitration before the breakout of
the battle of Siffin. But he put forward his proposal only when he was
sure of his defeat. So, his taking resort to the Book of Allah was nothing
but a clever device to escape the certain defeat. Ali~ had, on the other
hand, accepted the peace proposal very reluctantly and under serious
threat and compulsion. In short, Abdullah bin Abbas ~ and many
others blamed Abu Musa Ash'ari ~ of being deceived. Abu Musa
Ash'ari ~; rose to protest against the trick played by Amr bin Al-As
~ with the result that chaos and disorder enveloped the entire place.
Shuraih bin Hani attacked Amr bin Al-As ~ with his sword and he
responded with a counterattack but the people saved the situation.
The erupting disorder went in favor of Mu'awiyah • · It was because
the Syrians and the Iraqis could no longer stay in the company of one
another and they put up a resolution with common consent to depart.
Abu Musa Ash'ari • and Amr bin Al-As ~ left for Damascus along

484

History of Islam

with their men while Shuraih and Abdullah bin Abbas ~ proceeded
to Kufah in the company of his own people. The people from Makkah
and Al-Madinah also left the place dejected and shocked.
[The details presented by the compiler and other historians
regarding the selection of the arbitrators and the decision have
been based on the Shiite narratives and are full of doubts and
faults. It is not imaginable that in the case of such an important
issue, the arbitrators had been so negligent that they did nothing
for six months and didn't consider any thing until the day of
announcement, then suddenly they have announced the decision
after a little consideration on some ordinary issues at that time.
And in that decision also, one arbitrator had cheated half the
nation, inviting the danger of a more severe fight than Siffin
between the two parties.
In fact, the two arbitrators had reached a compact decision after
their sincere efforts of six months and after collecting the opinions
of the nation. This decision was also announced but the
documentation of the decision has been concealed or destroyed in
such a way that there is no trace of it. In its place, a fabricated story
has been presented with every possible relief for Ali ~' and with
aspects of blames on the Syrians and even the arbitrators.
However, from the folds of the events and the overall condition of
the occurrences thereafter, the original decision can be extracted as
follows :
1. Because Ali took the Bai'ah in a doubtful atmosphere; kept with

him the murderers of Uthman; claimed himself to be the rightful
caliph and fought every such person who denied his Bai'ah, but
didn't agree to take Qisiis (retaliation) from the murderers of
Uthman, although it was an obligation upon him as a caliph. So, he
should be removed from the caliphate and prevented from using·
sword as a caliph. But the areas under his control should remain
under him as a governor until a new caliph assumes his
responsibilities.
2. Mu'awiyah was neither a caliph nor he claimed caliphate. But
the areas under him were under his governorship only and these
should remain so until the new caliph is selected.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

485

3. After the restoration of normalcy, a body of distinguished
Muslims including Ali and Mu'awiyah, should select a suitable
and impartial person freely as a caliph.
4. The new caliph will be responsible for the investigation and the
Qisds of the murder of Uthman, so Mu'awiyah should remain quiet
about his claim of Qisds of Uthman until the new caliph assumes
his responsibility.
The first three points of this decision can be found in slightly
altered form in all the history books. It is the characteristic of
Shiites that they change an event in such a condition and such a
trick that all the good and virtuous aspects are turned into evil and
vicious appearance. As they have changed the good proposal of
making the Book of Allah a judge to stop the battle of Siffin, into a
cheating trick of raising the Qur'an on spears to deceit Ali~ and
to avoid the defeat; while the truth was that only one man took the
Qur'an to Ali.;$;,.
The fourth point is proved right by the fact that after it, Mu'awiyah
~ remained quiet about his claims regarding Qisds of Uthman .;$;,.
The third point is verified by a narration of Ibn Umar ~ in Sahih
Bukhari which states that he went to the gathering to hear the
decision of the arbitrators by the insistence of Hafsah ~ . He said:
"When the people dispersed (after hearing the decision),
Mu'awiyah delivered a Khutbah and said: 'Whoever wants to say
something in this matter (the caliphate), he should present his head
for us. (He should remember that) we are more rightful to it than
him and his father."' (Bukhari 4108, Fath Al-Bari 7 I 403)
This shows that the arbitrators had made a decision for the
selection of a caliph unanimously apart from the two fighting
chiefs. Mu'awiyah ~ was challenging the same person who may
be the candidate of caliphate after the decision.
The sitting in which Mu'awiyah ~ made the challenge, was not a
gathering of people from both the sides, but it was a group of such
great Companions who remained neutral in the fight. Even Habib
bin Maslamah was not present in the gathering who was very close
to Mu'awiyah ~- The Companions surely had guessed about the
attitude of Mu 'awiyah ~ that he would not accept any other

486

History of Islam

caliph easily, and there was a possibility of severe resistance from
his side; and in such a case the selection of a new caliph would
create more turmoil.
Moreover, if the historic narratives are correct, when the decision
was reported to Ali ~' he denied accepting it saying that the
decision was not according to the Book of Allah, and that the
arbitrators had exceeded in their powers. While no point of the
decision was against the Book of Allah, nor the arbitrators had
decided anything exceeding their powers. However, the result of
the attitude of Ali ~ and Mu'awiyah ~ both, was that the
decision of the arbitrators was not implemented effectively and
both the persons carried their governing in the respective areas,
and made efforts to take up the areas governed by the other.]
The Syrian people along with Amr bin Al-As ~ were going back
happy at their victory, while the party accompanying Abdullah bin
Abbas ~ and Shuraih bin Hani were making their journey in a
chaotic state accusing one another for the failures they experienced.
They showed the same sign of disunity and disorder which was
witnessed when Ali ~ was going back to Kufah with his troops.
After reaching Kufah, Abdullah bin Abbas~ told the whole story to
Ali ~, and he declared the verdict of Abu Musa~ and Amr bin AlAs ~ against the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of
Allah and rejected it outright. He also cursed Mu'awiyah, Amr bin AlAs ~, Habib bin Maslamah, Abdur-Rahman bin Mukhallad, Dahhak
bin Qais, Walid, and Abul-A'war. When Mu'awiyah ~ came to know
of this, he too cursed Ali ~; and it was the beginning of cursing and
reproaching one another by their respective followers.
The disorder and confusion that charged the atmosphere of Adhruh
with acrimony of the worst nature, paved the way for Mu'awiyah ~
to be addressed as the Chief of the believers and the Caliph of the
Muslims. But because of the events of Adhruh, no new groups joined
him. Ali~ was already facing trouble, which was only multiplied by
now. His fresh trouble now was to make his own people understand
that the verdict given at Adhruh was not acceptable because the
arbitrators themselves had dissented in their opinion on the issue. In
addition, the Qur'an had not given them permission to leave its track

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

487

to follow their personal opinion. Ali ~ spent the next few days in
putting into the minds of his people that the decision of the arbitrators
being unacceptable, they should invade Syria without loss of time.
They at last agreed.

Disruptive Activities of the Khawarij
When the Khawarij came to know of this decision, they grew anxious
and they took a new tum. It has already been mentioned that Hurqus
bin Zuhair had asked Ali ~ to attack the Syrians instead of agreeing
with the proposal of arbitration. Now Zur'ah bin Al-Burj and Hurqus
bin Zuhair both being the chieftains of the Khawarij, came to Ali ~
and declared him guilty of first rejecting and then accepting the
proposal advanced by the Khawarij. Now, on this score, they
demanded Ali ~ to show his repentance for his mistake in order to
receive their support. But Ali ~ turned down their demand pleading
his innocence over the issue. Hearing this, both of them got up and left
the place saying: "There is no command (acceptable) except of Allah."
When, following this event, Ali~ ascended the pulpit of the mosque
to deliver his address, a Khariji sounded in a loud voice from a corner:
"There is no command (acceptable) except of Allah." Ali~ remarked,
"Behold, these people extract untruth from the Word of Truth." He
then resumed his address and the same voice came again interrupting
him: "There is no command (acceptable) except of Allah."
Thereupon Ali ~ said, "You people are treating me improperly. We
do not debar you from making entry into the mosque, and we gave
you your share from the booty while you remained with us; we shall
not fight with you unless you take the initiative, and we shall be
awaiting Allah's Decision about you." Saying this, he descended the
pulpit and went away. The Khawarij also left the mosque and
gathered in the house of Abdullah bin Wahb for consultations.
Abdullah bin Wahb, Hurqus bin Zuhair, Hamzah bin Sinan, Zaid bin
Husain At-Tai', and Shuraih bin Aufa 'Absi decided, after a good deal
of deliberations, that they should leave Basrah and make the hills the
seat of their independent rule separate from Ali ~ - Hamzah bin
Sinan Asadi proposed to choose a chief and give him the standard
before proceeding further.

488

History of Islam

The next day they assembled again in the house of Shuraih, and
Abdullah bin Wahb was elected the chief of the Khawarij. They took
Bai'ah at his hands. Abdullah bin Wahb then suggested to move
towards a city where the Divine command could be enforced. At last
they agreed on Mada'in, which they could, according to them, capture
comparatively easily. Zaid bin Husain proposed to move in twos, fours
or tens, for collective movement was likely to be given chase. They also
decided to first halt at Naharwan and ask their friends and supporters
in Basrah to join them before reaching Mada'in. This suggestion gained
the support of one and all. The plan was implemented according to the
decision. Mis'ar bin Fadaki Taimi came out at the head of five hundred
Khawarij. When Ali ~ , came to know of the developments, he sent
message to Sa'd bin Mas'ud, the governor of Mada'in through a speedy
courier to put a check on the Khawarij in Mada'in. Sa'd deputed his
nephew in Mada'in and moved out at the head of a contingent. He
came across a band of the Khawarij on the way at Karkh and
challenged them which led to an encounter continuing until evening.
But the Khawarij crossed the Tigris in the darkness of night. The
Khawarij from Basrah also crossed the Tigris and joined their friends in
Naharwan after an encounter with Sa'd's contingent. At Naharwan
they consolidated their position and issued an edict of blasphemy
against Ali ~~ for killing the supporters of the Caliph. In a short time
their number rose to twenty-five thousand.

Battle of Naharwan
After the exit of the Khawarij from Kufah, Ali 4~ persuaded the Kufis
to make preparations for the invasion of Syria. He preferred the ouster
of Mu'awiyah
to the curbing of the Khawarij. Thus he sent a
message to Abdullah bin Abbas ~ in Basrah to send the maximum
number of troops for launching an attack on Syria. Although Basrah
had more than sixty thousand fighters, the letter of Ali ~ could rouse
only three thousand for fighting. Kufah too showed signs of lack of
interest. When three thousand troops headed by Jariyah bin Qudamah
,4'~ reached Kufah, Ali d"fo made a fresh attempt to kindle in Kufis the
fire of zeal and fervor and his renewed efforts hit the mark. Forty
thousand man gathered under the flag of Ali ~ .

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

489

He also wrote the Khawarij a letter calling them to lend their support
in the task of attacking Syria. Abdullah bin Wahb read out the letter to
his people and wrote back with common consent: "You appointed the
arbitrators against the Command of Allah and His Messenger. And
you have now developed a desire to invade Syria on the demand of
your self's desire. However, if you show your repentance after
declaring yourself as blasphemous, we are ready to help you,
otherwise we are prepared to fight against you."
Although the letter saddened Ali ~, he did not give up his
determination to invade Syria. He made an all-out effort to bring the
Khawarij back to righteousness but in vain. When Ali~ reminded
them of their mounting pressure on him to stop the attack on the
Syrian Army, they argued that they admitted their fault and he
should also follow suit. He should also come back to the fold of Islam
by declaring himself blasphemous as they did. This was the only way
they could take back their edict against him, otherwise they will wage
Jihad against him considering him a Kafir (disbeliever).
Ali ~, however, decided to carry out his campaign against Syria and
ignore the insane demand of the Khawarij, that he was informed of
the martyrdom of Abdullah bin Khabbab ~- The victim passed
through Naharwan during a journey. A group of the Khawarij came
to know that he was a Companion. They came to him and asked
about Abu Bakr and Umar ~- Abdullah bin Khabbab ~ said, "Both
of them were very pious and true servants of Allah the Almighty."
They then inquired of the first and the last parts of the caliphate of
Uthman ~- He replied, "He was truth-loving from beginning to the
end." They then wanted to know his opinion about Ali ~ before and
after the appointment of the arbitrators. He stated, "Ali knows and
understands the injunctions of Allah and His Messenger more than
you all." Hearing this, the Khawarij fell in wrath and killed Khabbab
~, his wife and his fellow travelers.
On being informed of this, Ali ~ asked Harith bin Murrah to make
an inquiry into the matter. The Khawarij killed him also. Along with
this, it was reported to Ali ~ that they were killing all those who
disagreed with them. Thus, Ali's men grew anxious that the Khawarij
would capture Kufah and Basrah and kill their wives and children in case

490

History of Islam

they advanced towards Syria. They marched towards the Khawarij
instead of Syria and sent them the following message from a place
nearby: "Hand over those among you who have killed our brothers so
that we can kill them according to the law of Qisas, and leave you to
yourselves in order to proceed to Syria. May Allah the Almighty bring
you back to the right path while we finish with the Syrians."
Following this, Ali ~ sent a number of Companions one by one to
preach to them righteousness and truth. He also invited the
deputation of the Khawarij to instill in their minds that they were
totally responsible for the appointment of the arbitrators, and they
should join him forgetting the past. But every time they had the same
answer to give and the same argument to advance. Ali~ would say,
"I believed in Allah and migrated in His way, how can I declare
myself a disbeliever?"
At last Ali~ himself went to the camp of the Khawarij and began to
preach them to use wisdom and adopt righteousness. Fearing the
strength of the impression Ali's speech would have on their people,
the chieftains asked them not to pay attention to what he said and go
to war.
In view of their attitude, Ali ~ came back and set himself to the task
of organizing his troops and appointing commanding officers of the
attacking army. This task being over, Ali~ gave Abu Ayub Ansari
~ the flag of peace and asked him to ascend to a raised spot and give
a general call saying: "Those who come to us without a fight will get
peace, and those who go to Kufah or Mada'in will also enjoy peace."
Having heard this announcement, Farwah bin Naufal Ashja'i moved
apart with five hundred horsemen, some people left for Kufah while
some others either went to Mada'in or came to join Ali's troops, with
the result less than one-third of the men were left with the Khawarij.
Ali~ then launched a massive attack and put the rest to death.
All the prominent chieftains of the Khawarij like Abdullah bin Wahb,
Zaid bin Husain, Hurqus bin Zuhair, Abdullah bin Shajarah, and
Shuraih bin Aufa lost their lives. Only nine of them saved themselves
by fleeing from the scene of death. Ali ~ came back leaving their
dead bodies unburied.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

491

Finished with the necessary task of curbing the upnsmgs of the
Khawarij, Ali ~ decided to march towards Syria. Ash'ath bin Qais
advised him to let the army take a few days rest, but he preferred to
stay at Nukhailah issuing orders for one and all to refrain from going
to Kufah until the Syrian campaign was completed. But they left for
home and Ali ~ also had to return to Kufah, when he found the
camp without fighters. In Kufah, Ali ~ addressed them to get
prepared for the invasion of Syria but none of them appeared to be
interested in the Syrian campaign. In view of their cold response, Ali
~ was also forced to abandon his campaign against Syria.

State of Egypt
As alread y mentioned, Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~, the governor of
Egypt, was not of any help to Ali ~ against Mu'awiyah ~ owing to
his bitter engagements and internal feuds with those who wouldn't
take Bai'ah until Uthman's murderers were punished. Finishing with
the battle of Siffin, Ali ~ sent Malik Ashtar Nakha'i as the governor
of Jazirah but very shortly sent him to Egypt as governor.
When Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ came to know of this, he grew
sorry and dejected. Mu'awiyah ~ became anxious because of
Ashtar's qualities of thought and action. But Malik Ashtar died
suddenly in route to Egypt and Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~
remained in power. Following the death of Malik Ashtar, Ali ~
wrote Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ that he had sent Ashtar as
governor of Egypt not because he was angry with him but because
Ashtar could solve some political matters more skillfully. But, since,
Ashtar died he was allowed to manage the affairs of Egypt as usual.
Moreover, he was required to face the enemy with courage and
determination.
In reply to the letter, Muhammad bin Abu Bakr~ wrote that he was
loyal to him and was ready to fight his (Ali's) enemies at any time.
These events had taken place before the decision of the arbitrators.
The Syrians later accepted Mu'awiyah ~ as Caliph and it added to
his power and grandeur. He then entered into correspondence with
Mu'awiyah bin Hudaij and those who opposed Muhammad bin Abu

492

History of Islam

Bakr ~ to encourage them. They sought help from Mu'awiyah ~
and that was what he intended. Thus he lost no time in dispatching
Amr bin Al-As • at the head of six thousand troops with a letter in
the name of Muhammad bin Abu Bakr~- Reaching close to Egypt,
Amr bin Al-As • sent Mu'awiyah's letter to Muhammad bin Abu
Bakr ~ along with his own. Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ sent both
the letters to Ali. in Kufah.
Ali ~ gathered the people and roused them to take part in the
Egyptian campaign but not more than two thousand men were ready
to fight. At last, he sent these two thousand men to Egypt under the
command of Malik bin Ka'b. Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ had
already sent two thousand troops against Amr bin Al-As~ under
the command of Kinanah bin Bishr who was martyred fighting with
the Syrians and his men either fled from the field or were killed
fighting.
With the news of the defeat, Muhammad bin Abu Bakr~ decided to
personally lead his troops. The awe-stricken men of Muhammad bin
Abu Bakr ~ showed no courage to face the Syrians and fled, leaving
their commander who was fighting alone, he came back from the
battlefield and took refuge in the house of Jabalah bin Masruq. The
house was surrounded by the Syrians and the companions of
Mu'awiyah bin Hudaij. Muhammad bin Abu Bakr~ came out of the
house and was arrested trying to fight his opponents. Mu'awiyah bin
Hudaij killed him and burned him putting his body inside the skin of
a dead donkey.
The news of the incident was brought to Ali~ by his spy AbdurRahman bin Shabib Fazari. He at once sent someone to bring Malik
bin Ka'b back. Malik bin Ka'b had covered about half the distance
when Hajjaj bin Amr bin Ghaziyah Ansari came across and informed
him of the assassination of Muhammad bin Abu Bakr~ and Amr bin
Al-As' victory over Egypt. Meanwhile, Ali. assembled the people of
Kufah and reproached them for their laziness and neglect. But this
stirring address failed to inspire the audience and they remained
unmoved. Now, Ali. was under circumstantial compulsion to give
up the campaign of Egypt and Syria.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

493

Attempts made to capture Other Provinces
The conquest of Egypt was very encouraging for Mu'awiyah • . His
next step was to wrest even Basrah from the hands of Ali • . The
atmosphere of Basrah was not much different from Egypt. The battle
of Jamal had angered them with Ali. and a growing demand for
revenging the blood of Uthman ~ had developed among the people
in general. Taking advantage of the situation, Mu'awiyah ~ sent
Abdullah bin Al-Hadrami towards Basrah with the instruction that
the elements antagonistic to Ali ~ be assimilated and their hearts won
by all means. When lbn Al-Hadrami reached Basrah, he found the
situation in Basrah conducive to his plan particularly when Abdullah
bin Abbas ~' the governor of Basrah was not present and had gone
to Ali ~- A large party of the people joined him. Being informed of
the new development in Basrah, Ali ~ made no delay in sending
A'in bin Dubai'ah with the instruction of creating a rift among those
who had joined hands with lbn Al-Hadrami. He was crowned with
success in the task entrusted to him. Thus the campaign of Abdullah
bin Al-Hadrami ended in his assassination in the last days of 38 AH,
in Basrah.
In 39 AH, when the Persians noticed that Basrah was divided between
the followers of Ali ~ and Mu'awiyah ~' they rose in revolt and
expelled the governor, Sahl bin Hunaif, from their territory. Ali~
wrote Ibn Abbas ~' the governor of Basrah to send Ziyad to Persia
who went there and put down the revolt with a heavy hand.
In a situation, fraught with discontent and uprising against Ali.,
Mu'awiyah ~ took advantage of the situation by using generosity,
forgiveness, strategies and appreciation to one and all. This attitude
proved fruitful as people in large numbers from Al-Madinah, Ta'if
and Yemen drew near to him. He also sent Nu'man bin Bashir to Ainut-Tamr where Malik bin Ka'b, the governor did not receive
reinforcements from Ali ~ and yielded the territory to the Syrian
commander. Mada'in and Anbar met the same fate and Sufyan bin
Auf returned to Damascus with huge possessions from these
territories. Although Ali ~ made an advancement to intercept him,
Sufyan bin Auf got away uncaught.

494

History of Islam

Ali's Caliphate confined to Iraq and Iran
Busr bin Abu Artah was dispatched to the Hijaz and Yemen while the
Madinites took the oath of allegiance at the hand of Mu'awiyah •
followed by the Makkans and Yemenites. Ubaidullah bin Abbas •
was turned out from San'a', the capital of Yemen. In short, by 40 AH,
Yemen, Hijaz, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt became provinces under the
control of Mu'awiyah • and these territories were free from the
weaknesses of discontent, insurgence, and internal disputes.
Both Ali. and Mu'awiyah. had reached consensus on the issue of
leaving Makkah and Al-Madinah outside their rule. Ali's caliphate
was confined to Iraq and Iran. But a large number of Arabian tribes of
Iraq lacked attachment with his caliphate while the Persians were also
dreaming of their own rule. Even Kufah and Basrah, the two principal
cities had a considerable number of men who preferred Mu'awiyah
• to Ali • . Even though Ali • was determined to establish one
Islamic rule throughout by virtue of his courage and bravery, his men
showed a lack of courage and loyalty. Ali's army was largely manned
by non-Arabs while that of Mu'awiyah's had mostly Arabs in
command. With the inclusion of Hijaz and Yemen, Mu'awiyah's army
had achieved much strength and popularity. Since, he was not on
equality with Ali • in personal status, greatness and glory, he could
not claim for himself the same position in the world of Islam and so
he continued to fear Ali • .

Abdullah bin Abbas' Departure from Basrah
During the beginning of 40 AH, one more ugly incident took place.
Abdullah bin Abbas~, the governor of Basrah, grew angry with Ali
• and left Basrah. The exit of Abdullah • was on account of a false
complaint lodged to Ali • by Abul-Aswad of Basrah that he had
spent from the public treasury without seeking permission from the
Caliph. Ali • thanked Abul-Aswad for bringing the irregularities of
the governor to the knowledge of the Caliph and held this as an act of
sympathy. He also wrote Abdullah bin Abbas ~ that he had received
such a complaint and demanded an explanation from him as well. But

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

495

the letter did not mention the name of Abul-Aswad. Abduilah bin
Abbas ~ wrote back that the complaint was totally false and baseless
for what he had expended was from his personal account and had
nothing to do with the public treasury. Ali~ wrote him again, "If
you claim that the money spent belonged to yourself then wherefrom
did you get the money and where had you deposited that?" In reply
to the letter Abdullah ~ wrote back, "I hate such a governorship, you
may choose anybody else as the governor of Basrah. What I spent was
my personal possession and I have every right to spend it." He
dispatched the letter to Ali ~ and with it he quit his post and left for
Makkah.

Ali's Martyrdom
During these very days Aqil bin Abu Talib ~' the brother of Ali ~
grew angry with him and went to Mu'awiyah ~ who welcomed him
and fixed a considerable daily allowance for him. Ali~ felt deeply
aggrieved at the separation of Aqil ~ and his joining the camp of
Mu'awiyah ~- Now Ali~ thought military action against Mu'awiyah
~ a necessity. It was an occasion when sixty thousand Kufis took
Bai'ah at Ali's hands to support him and fight on his behalf while they
had life in them. He then engaged himself in the task of collecting
more people in addition to the sixty thousand men and procure as
much military equipment as he could.

Dangerous Plan of the Khawarij
It has been mentioned above that only nine persons from the

Khawarij survived the battle of Naharwan. They were the persons
that were in the leadership positions among the Khawarij, at first they
spread into various parts of Persia and launched violent propaganda
attacks and hatched conspiracies against Ali ~. When their efforts
proved fruitless, they came to Iraq and Hijaz and started seeking
listeners. At last, three persons, Abdur-Rahman bin Muljam Muradi,
Burak bin Abdullah Tamimi and Amr bin Bakr Tamimi gathered
together in Makkah and kept expressing profound grief over the men
slain in Naharwan. At last they entered into a pact to do away with
the three men in power that had been putting the entire world of

496

History of Islam

Islam to such a great loss and destruction. According to their plan
Abdur-Rahman bin Muljam Mura.di-the Egyptian, Burak bin
Abdullah Tamimi, and Amr bin Bakr Tamimi Sa'di each agreed to kill
Ali, Mu'awiyah and Amr bin Al-As :$, respectively. Ramadan 16 and
the morning prayer were fixed as the date and time of the
assassinations. With this nefarious plan in view, they left for Kufah,
Damascus and Egypt.
When the date fixed for killing came, Burak bin Abdullah Tamimi
entered the mosque of Damascus and hit Mu'awiyah with his sword
while he was leading Fajr prayer. He then fled the mosque but was
caught. His mission failed because the injuries his victim received
were not fatal. Mu'awiyah ~ regained his health after a couple of
days of treatment. Burak was killed then and there, or after several
years of captivity according to another narrative. Mu'awiyah ~ then
practiced caution and put guards for his safety inside the mosque.
On the same day and date, Amr bin Bakr struck Kharijah bin Abu
Habibah bin Amr and killed him with his sword mistaking him to be
Amir bin Al-As ~ while he was leading the Fajr prayer in the
mosque of Egypt. That morning Amr bin Al-As . was absent due to
illness and Kharijah bin Abu Habibah, a military officer was leading
the prayer as his substitute. The same day Abdur-Rahman bin
Muljam attacked Ali • in Kufah Mosque while he was leading the
Fajr prayer and left him critically injured, and he died after two days.
It is narrated that Abdur-Rahman bin Muljam came to Kufah and met
his friends but told none about his plan. After much deliberations he
acquainted his friend Shabib bin Bajrah Ashja'i with his plan and
sought his help in killing Ali •
in return for the killings in
Naharwan. He agreed after some initial reluctance. Furthermore, he
came into contact with the relatives of those ten persons of Tamim
tribe who were killed in Naharwan and took advantage of their anger
against Ali • .
lbn Muljam came closer to them and established friendly terms with
them. Among them he saw a very beautiful women named Qatam.
Her father and brother were also killed in Naharwan. Ibn Muljam
asked for her hand in marriage. She agreed and the head of Ali ~
was the bridal money. Ibn Muljam who had come with the same

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

497

purpose readily agreed to her terms. She then asked a person from
her relatives, named Wardan to help lbn Muljam. On the appointed
day lbn Muljam, Shabib bin Bajrah and Wardan came to the mosque
and hid themselves near the door from the night before the fateful
morning. Ali ~ entered the mosque as usual calling people for
prayer. First of all Wardan came out and struck him with his sword
but his sword hit the threshold or the wall and Ali~ safely went
ahead. But lbn Muljam darted towards Ali~ and struck his forehead
with his sword, which gave a deep injury. Ali .:tk, called out to catch
them. The people assembled in the mosque ran after the culprits.
Wardan and Shabib fled the mosque but Ibn Muljam could not and
was caught inside the mosque.
A Hadrami caught Shabib but he slipped out of his hands and then
disappeared. Wardan fled to his house but was caught there and put
to death. Ibn Muljam was brought before Ali .:tk,. He ordered saying
"He is to be killed if I succumb to my injuries; in case I recover, I shall
deal with him." He then turned towards Banu Abdul-Muttalib and
said, "Make not my assassination a pretext for shedding Muslim
blood; you will kill only my assassin by way of Qisas. Afterwards he
said addressing his elder son Hasan ~' "O Hasan ! If I succumb to
the injuries I have received, you will kill him with a stroke of your
sword but avoid mutilation for the Prophet ~ has strictly forbidden
this."
Although Ibn Muljam's sword had gone down deep into the brain of
Ali ~, he remained alive through Friday and died only on Saturday,
Ramadan 17. A little before his death Jundub bin Abdullah came to
him and said, "May we elect Hasan as Caliph in case you pass away?"
He replied, "I have nothing to say about it, you will do according to
the need of the hour."
Following this he called Hasnain (Hasan and Husain)~ and said, "I
tell you to keep fearing Allah and not to indulge in worldliness.
Express no sorrow over what you are not able to get. Always say the
right thing and show mercy to the orphans and help the helpless.
Extend your help to the oppressed while keep opposing the
oppressors and keep following the Qur'an without fearing reproach
in carrying out the Commands of Allah." He then said, addressing

498

History of Islam

Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyah, "I tell you to follow what I have told.
Moreover, show respect to both your brothers; they command a
greater right on you and you must not do anything against their will."
Thereafter he turned to Hasnain ~ and said, "You should also treat
Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyah well an.d keep making concessions to
him." He then took to dictating his will in general when the last hour
approached and he bade his last farewell with La ilaha illallah (There is
no God except Allah) on his lips.

Ali's Grave traceless
Following the death of Ali~, lbn Muljam was made to appear before
Hasan ~ who killed him with one stroke of his sword. Ali ~ was
honored with martyrdom at the age of sixty-three and passed five
years as a caliph. Hasan, Husain and Abdullah bin Ja'far $, washed
his body and shrouded him in three pieces of cloth without a shirt.
Hasan ~, led the funeral prayer. But there is a wide difference of
opinion with regard to his burial ground. Some people say that he
was buried in the Kufah Mosque while others say that he was buried
in his house, or somewhere ten miles away from Kufah.
According to some narratives, Hasan ~ buried him at an unknown
place after taking his body out of his grave anticipating an act of
desecration from the Khawarij. Still one more narrative says that his
bier was carried to Al-Madinah to bury him near the grave of Prophet
~- But the camel carrying the body fled away and remained traceless.
Contradicting this narrative, yet another one lends support to the
opinion that the camel with the body of Ali~ was traced at Tai and
he was buried there. It is a wonder that the grave of such a great
personality lies traceless to this day. However, the reason behind his
burial at an unknown place was the Khawarij menace.

Wives and Children
Ali i£,h married nine wives at different times and had fourteen sons
and seventeen daughters. He was first married to Fatimah 1$, , the
daughter of the Prophet ~ who gave him two sons, Hasan and
Husain ~ , and two daughters Zainab and Umm Kulthum ~- After

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

499

the death of Fatimah ~, he married Umm-un-Nabiyin bint Haram
Kalabiah who gave him four sons, Abbas, Ja'far, Abdullah and
Uthman~.
His third wife was Laila bint Mas'ud bin Khalid from whom
Ubaidullah and Abu Bakr ~ were born. The fourth Asma' bint
Umais gave him Muhammad Al-Asghar and Yahya. These eight
brothers were martyred fighting with Husain ~ in Karbala. His fifth
wife Umamah bint Abul-As bin Ar-Rabi' bin Abdul-Uzza bin Abd
Shams whose mother was Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet ~ and
Muhammad Al-Ausat was born to her.
His sixth marriage was with Khaulah bint Ja'far who was from Banu
Hanifah, he had with her Muhammad Al-Akbar also known as
Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyah. From his seventh marriage with Sahba
bint Rabi'ah Taghlabiah he got Umar bin Ali, Ruqayyah bint Ali. His
eighth wife was Umm Saeed bint Urwah bin Mas'ud Thaqafiyah with
whom he got Umm Hasan, Ramlat-ul-Kubra and Umm Kulthum
Sughra.
His ninth and the last marriage was with Mukhbi'ah the daughter of
Imra-ul-Qais bin Adi Kalbiyah gave him a daughter who died young.
He had some other daughters too but their names are unknown. His
one son Aun is stated to be born to Asma' bint Umais. However, Ali's
progeny came from Hasan, Husain, Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiyah,
Abbas and Ja'far ~ while the others did not survive long.

A Glance at Ali's Caliphate
Ali ~ was the last in the line of those who commanded respect
throughout the world of Islam. None after him could fight evil and
promote good. When Aishah ~ heard the sad news of Ali's death,
she observed : "Now the people are at liberty to do what they like, for
none is left to prevent them from wrongdoings."
Ali ~ was above craftiness. He was truth loving to the core. At first
he considered himself more within his rights to become the Caliph
owing to his close relationship with the Prophet ;i. Thus he did not
keep it secret from others and kept from making the oath of allegiance
to Abu Bakr ~ for sometime. During these same days, Abu Sufyan

500

History of Islam

~ instigated him to rise against Abu Bakr• but he rebuked him

rather violently and with contempt for he hated such an act. When he
reconciled himself with the reality that the job of a caliph required
qualities of head and heart other than mere relationship, he found
Abu Bakr ~ worthy of the responsibilities and pledged his allegiance
to him on his own and remained loyal to him throughout.
During his caliphate, Umar Faruq • sought Ali's advice and held it
valuable. He lent his sincere advice to Uthman ~ thinking least
whether he acted upon it or not. And whenever he found any of
Uthman's action objectionable, he opposed it without any reservation.
When the people opposed Uthman ~ ' he supported them to the
extent that it was valid. When the rioters mounted their violent
pressure on Uthman ~ and an ugly situation was created, he showed
no craftiness in keeping his position clear and remained satisfied with
the clarity of his conscience. When following the assassination of
Uthman ~ ' the people rose to pledge their allegiance to him, he
accepted for he considered himself more worthy than others for the
job.
In short, his deeds and actions proved beyond doubt that he was
never reluctant to speak the truth regardless of the consequences. His
face was the index of his feelings and his exterior was the mirror of
his interior. He was like an unsheathed sword and would speak the
truth frankly in every situation. Another person would have handed
over Muhammad bin Abu Bakr ~ and Malik Ashtar to be killed by
way of Qisas for Uthman' s blood and thus bought peace and security
for himself. But since he could not obtain solid evidence against the
assassins of Uthman ~' he held himself back from punishing the
accused and faced the resultant troubles but refu sed to bow down to
his opponents.
Majority of the persons Ali~ had to dealt with were crafty, shrewd
and expedient. The Islamic atmosphere created by the Prophet :i,
which continued to exist through the period of Umar Farug ~ ' did
not remain intact after more people from Persia, Egypt, and the other
lands entered the folds of Islam. Racial and ancestral superiority,
worldliness, desire for a comfortable and luxurious life distorted

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

501

much of the real face of Islam. During his tenure the number of
Companions had significantly decreased. Great and influential
Companions had already passed away and the rest had shifted from
Al-Madinah to settle in Kufah, Basrah, Damascus, Egypt, Yemen,
Makkah and Al-Madinah. Up to the period of Umar Farug~' almost
all the Companions lived in Al-Madinah. Ali~ shifted the capital of
Islam from Al-Madinah to Kufah but he did not make any substantial
gain from this change. He was deprived of the advantages he could
have gained in Al-Madinah. He failed to attract help from the Hijaz
because with the change of capital, the importance of the Hijaz was
diminished.
During the blessed period of the Prophet ~ the hypocrites and
conspirators tried their best to put the Muslims to trouble and loss but
their nefarious plans did not bear fruit. During the era of Abu Bakr
Siddiq and Umar Farug~' those who had vested interests, left no stone
unturned to inflict injuries to Islam but l'hey were dealt with severely.
They first got an opportunity to raise their heads during the caliphate
of Uthman bin Affan ~' and Ali ~ as his successor, had to bear the
brunt of the dealings of his predecessor. Furthermore, if he had some
more years as a caliph, he could have done away with the mischiefmongers and power hungry elements because in spite of the multiple
problems assailing him, he had the courage and determination to
combat them all. He never yielded to despair and discouragement.
However, it was the Will of Allah for him to depart leaving the field
open for Banu Umayyah.
The Banu Umayyah tribe considered itself the principal power of
Arabia and treated Banu Hashim as its r!val. Although Islam uprooted
evils of racial and ancestral snobbery, Uthman's caliphate revived it.
Banu Umayyah found in his caliphate a golden opportunity to restore
the lost power and leadership and the hypocrites aided and abetted
their plans. It was such a loss to Islam that Ali ~ could not compensate
for it during his entire tenure until his martyrdom.

If we take the campaigns of Ali ~ and Mu'awiyah ~ and the
opposition of Zubair ~ and Talhah ~ as cases similar to those of our
times, we are grossly mistaken. We can' t measure their moral
standards with our own. It is worth noting that Talhah ~ and Zubair

502

History of Islam

~ came to the battlefield with massive preparations against Ali~,

but a Hadith of the Prophet~ made both of them keep from fighting
and no amount of lashing and lambasting could rouse them to go
against Ali ~- It is an undeniable fact that fighting was natural for
them but one Hadith of the Prophet :ii changed their outlook and their
course of action.
Our religious leaders and scholars today indulge in a futile war of
words of a shameful nature and sometimes go to law courts for
worldly decisions on religious issues. No Verse of the Qur'an or
Hadith of the Prophet ~ proves effective enough to make them accept
the truth. It has already been mentioned that Mu'awiyah ~ had
sought from Ali ~ the issue of the inheritance of a eunuch after the
battle of Siffin and the judgment of the arbitrators.
When Ali ~ entered Basrah, Qais bin Ubadah stated that the people
said, "The Prophet ~ told you that you will be made Caliph after him.
Is this true?" Ali ~ had emphatically said, "This is utterly wrong. I
can never tell a lie about the Prophet ~ - Had he said so, how could J
have allowed Abu Bakr, Umar and Othman to become the Caliph and
give my allegiance to them?" How could anybody now make such
statements? Yet, we hear it from those who are called religious scholars
and pious Muslims. From Adam ~I to the Day of Judgment, struggle
between truth and untruth goes on and will go on. Divine and satanic
parties have always been there and they will exist until the Day of
Resurrection. This unending fight between right and wrong decides
the reward and punishment one will receive in the Hereafter.
Islam teaches moderation and prevents going to the extremes. People
have formed extreme views about Ali~- One group has degraded
him to the lowest level while another one, in opposition to the first
one, upgraded him to the position of god. In this respect Ali ~ was
put into a position like Isa (Jesus) when the Jews opposed him and
went astray, while the Christians lifted him up to the Divine level. But
pure and orthodox Muslims walk a middle path neither of the Shiite
nor the Khawarij.
As the Companions of the Prophet ~ can not be brought down to the
level of the reverend Muslims, sufis and common Muslims of our times,

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

503

they also cannot be taken above the human level. They were, after all,
humans. They ate and drank and slept like humans. They had other
human needs too. Even the Prophet ti claimed his being human and took
pride in his position as a slave of Allah. However, we are very sure of his
innocence and of his being perfect in total human virtues and excellence
and consider his life and deeds as a guiding light for us all.
The Companions were fortunate enough to watch and emulate his
example in letter and spirit. But, since, they were neither Prophets nor
innocent, and different from each other in abilities, they had different
aspects of human qualities to show. Among them we see Abu Bakr~
and Umar ~ on one hand and Mu'awiyah • and Mughirah ~ on the
other. They had jurists like Ali • and Aishah ~ and narrators of Hadith
like Abu Hurairah ~ and Ibn Mas'ud . , political activists like Amr
bin Al-As ~ and pious persons like Abdullah bin Urnar ~ and Abu
Dhar ~- Now, if they differ in thoughts, opinions and actions, it is
our duty to take these differences as a blessing in disguise and not to
fall prey to hasty decisions and thoughtless actions.
Up to 30 AH, twenty years after the death of the Prophet ~ , the
Muslims kept winning steady victories without loss. These conquests
brought to the fold of Islam almost all the civilized countries of the
world. From 30 AH to 40 AH, we find almost no Muslim victories and
they remained preoccupied with internal problems, bickering, feuds
and fighting. Although the decade-long disturbances were apparently
injurious to Islam, they had some hidden virtues for the Muslim Llmmah.
The twenty-year long spell of victories were the fruits of spiritual
power and the teachings of the Qur'an, while internal dissentions and
disruptions were the direct outcome of a materialistic approach to life.
Through death and destruction they learned to live under adverse
situations and win peace and progress after losses and reverses.
The fight goes on and will keep going on between good and bad, right
and wrong, light and darkness. Whenever materialism gains victory
over spiritual power, the two forces are bound to clash with one
another. When Musa (Moses) ~ I caught Harun (Aaron) ~I by his
beard, when Yusuf (Joseph) ~I could be thrown into the well by his
brothers and sold for a few coins, the differences among various
sections of the Companions must not be looked upon with amazement.

504

History of Islam

What took place between Ali ~ and Mu'awiyah ~ , left a deep scar
on the face of Islam. It has been serving the Muslims as a lesson to
learn from and to take care about since that time. Conflict between Banu
Umayyah and Banu Abbas, campaigns of the Ghaznawid and the
Ghorid against one another and the power struggles between rival
Muslim rulers throughout history have inflicted heavy losses in men
and materials but Islam is flexible enough to sustain these onslaughts
and rise again from the dust.
These ups and downs in Muslim life and character and power have
always been among the wonders of history. When Halaku (the son of
Ghengis Khan) ravaged Baghdad, it led to his progeny converting to
Islam. When the united Christian forces wrested Palestine from the
Muslims, Salahuddin Ayubi appeared on the scene and restored the
sacred land to the Muslim Urnrnah.
We find contrast in all the facets of the world. Islamic caliphate or
Islamic rule was in all respects a blessing for mankind. But it was not
spared the onslaught of decline and fall .
Readers of history are not pleased over the emergence of hypocrites
during the caliphate of Uthman ~ and opponents make an attempt
to hold Islam responsible for this. But dark forces have always been
there to fight the forces of light and virtue and they have, more than
once, attained temporary success in their nefarious plans. These forces
raised their heads with the martyrdom of Umar Farug~ and have
been raging against Islam since then .

Hasan•
Physical Features and Pedigree:
Hasan bin Ali bin Abu Talib ~ was the last of the Rightly-Guided
Caliphs. He was born in the middle of Sha 'ban 3 AH. He resembled
the Prophet~ who named him Hasan. Nobody had this name during
the Age of Ignorance. Imam Bukhari reports from Abu Bakr ~, "The
Prophet ~ was once sitting on the pulpit with Hasan beside him. He
would sometimes look toward s the audience and at times at Hasan
and said: 'This son of mine is the chief of the people and will make
peace between two factions of the Muslims'." The Prophet ~ was
once going somewhere with Hasan~ on his shoulder. A man came
across and remarked addressing Hasan ~, "What a good mount you
have got." At this the Prophet ~ replied "Even the rider is very
good." Abdullah bin Zubair ~ is reported to have said, "Hasan
resembled the Prophet :!i very much and he loved him dearly."

Praiseworthy Traits:
Hasa n ~ was very polite and generous and commanded high
respect. He had a great dislike for disturbance and bloodshed. He
performed Hajj twenty-five times on foot although he had his camel
with him. Umair bin Ishaq says, "Hasan alone is the p erson whom I
love to hear speaking. And I never heard him using foul language."
When Marwan bin AI-Hakam was the governor of Al-Madinah and
Hasan ~ had also shifted to Al-Madinah after quitting his caliphate,
he once sent someone to tell Hasan~, "You are like a mule (Allah
forbid), that when it is asked about its father it says my mother was a
mare." While sending his reply, he said, "I shall never forget that you
abuse me without any rea son. We have ultimately to go before Allah
the Almighty. So, if you are true in what you say, Allah the Almighty
will give you reward for that; in case you are a liar, Allah the
Almighty is the Greatest Avenger of all." Jarir bin Asma' relates,
"When Hasan passed away, Marwan burst into tears at his funeral
bier. When Husain ~ said to him, 'You now weep over him although

506

History of Islam

you kept annoying him during his lifetime." Marwan replied, 'Do you
know I could only do so with a person who was more tolerant than a
mountain." Ali bin Zaid ~ relates, "Hasan gave away as charity in
the way of Allah all his goods and chattels twice and gave half three
times." He would divorce women most frequently except one who
began to love him. At last Ali ~ had to ask the people of Kufah not to
~ve their daughters to him in marriage. But Hamadan said, "How
can it be that we refuse to give our daughters to him in marriage."
Someone mentioned before Hasan~ that Abu Dhar~ used to say, "I
hold dear poverty more than opulence and sickness more than
health." Thereupon he remarked, "May Allah show him mercy. As for
me, I leave myself totally in the Hand of Allah without desiring
anything; He will do what He likes; I dare not interfere in His
Decisions."
He handed over the caliphate to Mu'awiyah ~ in Rabi' AI-Awwal 41
AH. When his friends called him 'Ar-ul-Muslimin', he would say, "Ar
(shame) is better than Ndr (Hell)." When a person addressed him, "O
the disgracer of the Muslims. I salute you!" he answered back, "I am
not the disgracer of the Muslims; I simply thought not to sacrifice you
for the country." Jubair bin Nufair relates that he once said to Hasan
~, "It is in the air that you have once again developed a desire for the
caliphate." He replied "When the heads of the Arabs lay in my hands
and I could do with them as I liked, I gave it up to seek the Pleasure of
Allah, now am I expected to undo this merely to please the people of
the Hijaz?" He died in the month of Rabi' Al-Awwal 50 AH. They
suspect that he was poisoned to death. When Husain pressed~ him
to tell the name of the one who gave him poison, he answered saying,
"If the suspect has poisoned me, Allah the Almighty will take severe
revenge, otherwise why should one be unjustifiably killed for me."

Mentionable Events during the Caliphate of Hasan•
When Ali~ was asked on the eve of his death whether Bai'ah may be
taken at the hands of Hasan ~, he had said in plain words, "At
present I am involved in my own personal affairs so you do this with
whoever you like." They took it to be his indication in favor of Hasan

Second Halfof the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

507

~ and he was, therefore, chosen for the post. Qais bin Sa'd ~ bin

Ubadah was the first to take Bai'ah followed by others. At the time of
taking Bai'ah, Hasan ~ kept asking the people to admit: "Act
according to what I say; fight with whom I fight and make peace with
whom I enter into peace."
When Mu'awiyah ~ came to know of the martyrdom of Ali~, he
adopted the appellation of Amir-ul-Mu'minin (Chief of the believers).
Although he had obtained from the Syrians Bai'ah for his caliphate
following the decision of the arbitrators, he had it renewed. When Qais
bin Sa'd ~ was taking Bai'ah at the hand of Hasan~, he had uttered,
"I take Bai'ah at your hand to follow the Book of Allah and the Sunnah
of the Messenger of Allah and on waging Jihad." Thereupon Hasan ~
said, "Jihad and fighting form an integral part of the Book of Allah and
Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah, they need not, therefore, be
mentioned separately." Hasan's expression gave rise to speculation
among the people of Kufah that he was disinclined to fight.
Mu'awiyah ~, on the other hand, set out towards Kufah at the head of
sixty thousand men and sent a message to Hasan~, "Peace is better
than war, and it is proper for you to accept me as Caliph and take
Bai'ah at my hand." When he understood that Mu'awiyah ~ had
taking Kufah in mind, he left Kufah at the head of forty thousand
troops and sent Qais bin Sa'd ~ as vanguard with twelve thousand
fighters. When he reached Mada'in, someone spread the rumor that
Qais bin Sa'd ~ was killed. Hasan ~ halted there for a day to give
rest to the animals. He assembled his people and addressed them after
praising Allah the Almighty: "People! You have taken Bai'ah at my
hand that you will obey me in war and peace. I say, by my oath to
Allah the Exalted, that I harbor enmity against none, from the East to
the West there is none whom I hate or detest, I am one who prefers
unity, consensus, love and security to disunity, discord and enmity."

Verdict of Disbelief against Hasan ~
Having heard this speech, the Khawarij and the hypocrites spread the
rumor in the camp that Hasan ~ wanted to enter into peace with
Mu'awiyah ~' and they issued a verdict of blasphemy against him.

508

History of Islam

The verdict stirred the military camp. Opinion was divided between
his being a believer or a disbeliever. Very soon the faction charging
him with blasphemy dominated the scene and started making their
opponents victims of excesses of all kinds.
Many of them once entered the camp and surrounded Hasan ~ on
all sides calling him a disbeliever. They pulled his garments so
violently that they were torn into pieces. They also took away the
mantle from his shoulder and plundered the camp. Following this,
Hasan ~ hurried to the Rabi'ah and Hamadan clans on horseback
and called on them for help as they were his supporters. They helped
him without delay and removed the detractors from the camp.
He left for Mada'in afterwards. Jarrah bin Qabisah, a man from the
Khawarij, struck him with his spear and injured his thigh. He was
brought into the white palace of Mada'in where he stayed and
recovered his health. Qais bin Sa'd ~ sent as the vanguard at the
head of twelve thousand troops, was surrounded by Mu'awiyah ~ at
Anbar. He then sent Abdullah bin Amir to Hasan ~ on a peace
mission at the head of the vanguard. After the trouble in his camp,
Hasan ~ had sent Abdullah bin Harith bin Naufal to Mu'awiyah ~
for peace talk.
On being informed that Abdullah bin Amir had reached a little
distance from Mada'in at the head of a detachment, Hasan~ came
out of Mada'in with his army. When Abdullah bin Amir noticed
troops coming from the opposite direction, he drew near and called
out the people of Iraq aloud and said, "I have not come here for the
sake of fighting. I am leading the vanguard of Mu'awiyah ~ who is
halting at Anbar with a big army. You convey my salutation to Hasan
~ and tell him that Abdullah requests you by Allah to stop fighting
and save the people from death and destruction."
When Hasan ~ heard this, he came back to Mada'in and sent his
message to Abdullah that he was ready to make peace with Mu'awiyah
~ and quit his office of the caliphate in his favor on condition that he
would stick to the Book and the Sunnah and hold back from getting in
the way of his opponents by setting aside past activities and grant
safety of life and property to his (Hasan's) supporters.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

509

Abdullah bin Amir rushed to Mu'awiyah ~ with these conditions and
told him that Hasan ~ was ready to quit his post on certain
conditions. On being asked about the conditions, he said to Mu'awiyah
~, "The first condition is that the caliphate will be restored to him on
your death. Secondly, an annual amount of five hundred thousand
from the public treasury will be paid to him while you are alive.
Thirdly, he will collect the tribute from Ahwaz and the Persian
territories."
These three rather hard conditions were the making of Abdullah's
own mind. Following these he placed before Mu'awiyah ~ the
conditions, which were actually put forward by Hasan ~Mu'awiyah ~ very eagerly agreed to all and more than that. He is
reported to have said, "Hasan's intention appears fair and he seems to
bring peace between two factions of the Muslims." With this remark
Mu'awiyah •
put down his signature on a blank piece of paper and
asked Abdullah bin Amir to take that to Hasan • to write down all
his conditions to be fulfilled by me.
When Husain ~ and Abdullah bin Ja'far ~' came to know of this
development, they approached Hasan ~ and tried to hold him back
from the implementation of his plan. But Hasan. declined their advice.
He had watched the activities of the people of Iraq and Kufah from the
time of Ali • . He was conscious of Mu'awiyah' s abilities in running
the administration of his territories and skill in statecraft. Therefore, he
remained firm in his determination to accept the peace offer.

Peace Treaty
When Hasan saw the signed and stamped paper brought by Abdullah
bin Amir from Mu'awiyah . , he objected to the condition that the
caliphate would be restored to him after the demise of Mu'awiyah • .
He said, "I strongly dislike the condition of my being chosen Caliph
after Mu'awiyah, if I had a longing for the caliphate, why should I
quit it now." Following this he sent for the scribe and asked him to
write the peace document in the following words:
"This peace document is being written between Hasan bin Ali
bin Abu Talib and Mu'awiyah bin Abu Sufyan. Both of them

510

History of Islam

agree on the following:
The office of the caliphate is handed over to Mu'awiyah bin
Abu Sufyan. The Muslims will be at liberty to elect a Caliph of
their own choice after Mu'awiyah. The Muslims as a whole will
remain safe from the hands and tongue of Mu'awiyah and he
will treat all with grace. He will not stand in the way of Ali's
relatives, and the supporter's of Hasan and Husain bin Ali will
not suffer at his hands. Both these brothers and their relatives
will be free to go anywhere and settle at any place. Mu'awiyah
and his governors will not have the right to force them to carry
out their orders by treating them as their subjects. Mu'awiyah is
bound to keep sending the tribute from Ahwaz to Hasan bin
Ali, and the entire existing possessions of the public treasury of
Kufah will be within the rights of Hasan bin Ali and he will be
free to spend it at will. Mu'awiyah should prefer Banu Hashim
in giving gifts and rewards."
Some important people signed the document like Abdullah bin AlHarith bin Naufal and Amr bin Abu Salamah and others as witness
and surety. When the document was placed before Mu'awiyah ~' he
expressed his utmost joy over it. In the wake of this peace treaty,
Mu'awiyah ~ raised his siege and left Qais bin Sa'd ~ free.
Mu'awiyah ~ then reached the Grand Mosque of Kufah and took
Bai'ah from Hasan ~ and the people of Kufah. But Sa'd bin Qais ~
remained absent from the mosque. Mu'awiyah ~ also sent him a
piece of signed and stamped paper asking him to put down his own
conditions for taking Bai'ah, which would be totally accepted. He
demanded security of his life and those of his supporters without
asking for anything else. Mu'awiyah ~ conceded to it at once.
Thereupon he and his comrades came and took Bai'ah.
Husain ~ refused to take Bai'ah. When Mu'awiyah ~ pressed for it,
Hasan ~ told him not to insist, for his pride was dearer to him than
taking Bai'ah. Mu'awiyah ~ kept silent. But Husain ~ took Bai'ah
later. Amr bin AI-As ~ was present on that occasion. He advised
Mu'awiyah ~ to request Hasan ~ to deliver his address before the
audience. Mu'awiyah ~ liked the advice and in response to his request
Hasan ~ said addressing the people:"O Muslims! To me mischief is

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

511

highly detestable. I made peace with Mu'awiyah to save the Ummah of
my grandfather from tribulations and disturbances and accepted him
as commander and Caliph. Had the command and caliphate been his
right, he has got it; if it was mine, I bestowed it on him."

Prophecy of the Prophet ~
Following the process of establishing this peace treaty through all the
stages, one can marvel at the accuracy of the prophecy of the Prophet ~
about Hasan ~: "This son of mine is a chief and Allah the Almighty
will bring about peace between two groups of the Muslims through
him." When Hasan ~ descended from the pulpit, Mu'awiyah ~ got
up and said "Abu Muhammad! You have shown such a boldness and
bravery the like of which nobody has seen so far."
This peace treaty was signed in 41 AH, only six months after the
martyrdom of Ali~, that is why this year is named as 'Am-ul-Jamii'at.
After the finalization of peace, Mu'awiyah ~ left Kufah for
Damascus. He showed high regard for Hasan ~ while he remained
alive and kept sending him the amount agreed upon. In the wake of
Mu 'awiyah's departure from Kufah, the people indulged in
complaining against sending tribute to Hasan ~ from the Ahwaz
province. Thereupon Hasan ~ assembled the people and said
addressing them: "O the people of Iraq! I have repeatedly forgiven
you. You martyred my father, plundered my house, and injured me
with your lance. You keep in mind the two kinds of persons killed,
one killed in Siffin and another one killed demanding revenge for
those killed in Naharwan. What Mu 'awiyah has done with you is not
anything honorable for you and this is quite justified. Thus, if you
agree to die, I am ready to abrogate the peace treaty and seek justice
through the sword. But, in case you hold your lives dear, I shall stick
to this peace treaty."
Hearing this they pressed him to keep the peace treaty. Since he was
well aware of their ignorance and lack of courage, he corrected the
Kufis by simply administering a threat. Mu'awiyah ~ had now risen
as the unchallenged leader and Caliph of Islam. Even Sa'd bin Abu
Waqqas ~ who had relieved himself of all the affairs of life and was

512

History of Islam

passing his days grazing his camels and goats and worshiping Allah
in a state of seclusion, had also taken Bai'ah at the hand of Mu'awiyah
~- In short, none was there to hold himself back from taking Bai'ah
sooner or later. A few days after the peace treaty was signed, Hasan
~ left Kufah and proceeded to Al-Madinah along with his relatives.
The people of Kufah escorted him for some distance. From AlMadinah he went nowhere to settle.

Concocted Story of poisoning
He died in 50 or 51 AH. It is said that his wife Ju'dah bint Al-Ash'ath
poisoned him. However, Hasan ~ and Husain~ could not detect
the culprit, so how can she be blamed for this event? On the eve of his
death, Hasan ~ called Husain ~ and said, "The caliphate reached
Ali after the Prophet :Ji and swords were drawn but the issue
remained unsettled. I have now come to know it very well that
Prophethood and caliphate cannot remain combined in our family. I
am afraid the ignorant of Kufah will try to take you out of this city but
you should foil their attempt. I had once requested Aishah to allow
me to be buried near the Prophet~- She had then agreed. Maybe, she
will refuse permission now. However, approach her for this purpose
but without insistence." Following this advice Husain~ contacted
Aishah ~ immediately after the demise of Hasan ~ and sought
permission for his brother's burial and she gave her consent. But
Marwan stood in the way. Husain ~ and his comrades proceeded
towards him armed with their weapons but Abu Hurairah ~
intervened to save the situation. Hasan~ was then laid to rest beside
his mother, Fatimah~. Nine sons and six daughters survived him.

A Glance at Hasan's Caliphate
Some historians are reluctant to accept the six-month caliphate of
Hasan ~ as a part of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate on the plea of its
being short-lived and incomplete. However, this viewpoint appears to
be untenable. Should this argument be considered as acceptable, Ali's
caliphate will also have to be erased from the hierarchy of the
Righteous Caliphs, which is not justified. The shortness of his tenure
is also not a valid reason. If the caliphate of Hasan~ is carefully

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

513

taken into consideration, it is an important part of the Rightly-Guided
Caliphate. Even though the caliphate of Hasan ~ is devoid of
victories and cries of battles, it performed such a remarkable and
magnificent service to the world of Islam and its unity that a caliphate
spreading over scores of years and with a hundred victories could not
have accomplished. In respect of the marvelous role played by him in
bringing unity to the two warring groups of the Muslim Ummah, his
caliphate is unforgettable.
He put an end to the enmity of a decade in a stroke. He destroyed the
conspiracies and mischief of the hypocrites and Jews in the garb of
Muslims developed through a decade and grown strong and
formidable. In this way he paved the way for future victories and the
swords of the Muslim Ummah turned once again towards the enemies
of Islam. He certainly surpassed the bravery of a great warrior with
many victories when taking Bai'ah at the hand of Mu'awiyah ~' he
said: "Had the command and caliphate been his right, he has got it; if
it was mine, I bestowed it on him."
This remarkable event will serve to the Last Day as a guiding light for
the Muslim Ummah to keep to the right path. This glittering example
stands to this day as a lighthouse in the wild and fathomless dark
ocean. Hasan ~ had under his command forty thousand fighters.
They might have been unsteady, ignorant and impertinent, but all of
them had taken the oath of fighting against Mu'awiyah ~ to the last
drop of their blood. In such a situation it was a must for a young man
of 37, an experienced general and the son of a brave father to fight
against his father's rival. Hasan ~ knew it well that he, being the
darling of the Prophet ;Ji, would be able in a short period, to turn the
tide of the Companions and the world of Islam in his favor.

Few Sentences about the Guided Caliphate
The main difference between the Rightly-Guided Caliphate and that
of Banu Umayyah and others lies in the fact that every Caliph of the
Guided Caliphate was elected by a team of the men of sound
judgment. Even the nominated Caliph had the approval and support
of the majority of judicious persons. And such a nomination or
election had nothing to do with ancestral rights. But with the end of

514

History of Islam

this era ended this basic principle.
During the Rightly-Guided Caliphate, the Muslim Ummah as a whole
had every right to know about the state of affairs, to raise objections
and to advance its own reasons and opinions, but this practice was
abolished during the later caliphates.
During the Rightly-Guided Caliphate, the Caliphs practiced the utmost
simplicity with regard to their clothes, dwellings, food, and mounts.
They lived in the company of the common people and had no air of
superiority nor demanded any preferential treatment from the public.
During the Rightly-Guided Caliphate, the Caliph was not allowed to
spend even a penny from the public treasury on himself or friends
and relatives. Afterwards, they became the custodians of the treasury
and nobody could raise an objection against their lavish spending.
The Rightly-Guided Caliphs were all from among the exalted
Companions and had the honor of joining the blessed company of the
Prophet ::i. During the latter caliphates there was none from the
Companions except Mu'awiyah ~ and Abdullah bin Zubair ~JB.
The Righteous Caliphs belonged to the blessed category who had
been given the good news of going to Paradise during their lifetime,
afterwards there was none from this blessed and exclusive group.
They were those who showed affection to the Muslims like their own
children and did not treat them like their slaves. But later caliphates
rose in the pattern of Caesar and Chosroes.
The Rightly-Guided Caliphs were not despotic. In religious matters
too they could not act on their own. Whenever any doubt or
difference raised its head, they would seek advice from the
distinguished Companions and acted according to the example set by
the Prophet ::i. In case any of their decisions proved wrong at a later
stage, they put them right when the mistake was brought to their
knowledge. The fundamental principle governing their policies and
programs, in religious and temporal matters, rose from the Divine
law. Enforcement of Divine injunctions and establishing peace and
order were some of the duties, which were essentially expected of
them. Their people had full freedom of thought and action.

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

515

Everybod y had as his birthright, the right to ask for an explanation
from the Ca liph even in matters small and unimportant. A unique
feature of the caliphate was that the Caliph needed no force to enforce
his laws because everyone was ready and eager to follow the laws on
his own. It proves beyond doubt that their caliphates were based on
love and fa ith and not on pressure and atrocities. During the latter
caliphates, the task of enforcement of Divine laws were left to the
religious scholars and Qad!s (court judges) and men with religious
training were appointed to address the people and lead them in prayer.
However, the caliphs had an army and the finance in their hand s to
rule according to their wishes. Gradually their caliphates changed into
despotic regimes. Thus fear, terror, excesses and atrocities spread
throu ghout the land and public freedom was forfeited .
The Ri ghtly-Guided Caliphs gave priority to public w elfare.
Upholding the Word of Allah and enforcement of the Divine
injunctions were the two things they were very eager to execute, but
they had no lu st for territorial aggrandi zement.
It was not their practice to store collections and spoils of battles in the
public treasury; they distributed everything among the Muslims or
spent it on Muslim w elfare w orks. They were in the habit of sweeping
up the public treasury after spending all the possessions on public
projects and w elfare schemes. But the latter caliphate w orked on
contra ry lines.

The Rightly-Guided Caliphs would perform Hajj without fail, besides
performing Hajj, they took the opportunity to fulfill their duties to the
people and also gave them a forum for redressing their problems. They
managed to meet people from th e va rious Muslim territories, heard
their complaints and examined the merits and demerits of the related
governors and mitigated their sufferings. In case they were
preoccupied with some urgent work in the capital, they sent their
substitute to do the job but the latter caliphates deviated from this
practice.
The Rightl y-Guided Caliphs led prayers and addressed the
congregations in the Grand Mosque of the capital. Later on only the
caliphs from Banu Urna yyah maintained this practice.

516

History of Islam

During the Rightly-Guided Caliphates there was no trace of
factionalism and they solved their differences, if any, in the light of
the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet of Allah.
The Rightly-Guided Caliphates had no consideration for relations,
friendship, nationality and region in comparison with religion and
Shari'at. When we examine their methods of doing things, we find the
least care and almost no concession even for close relatives like father,
brother or son. Freedom of expression was practiced to such an extent
that an ordinary person had the courage to interrupt a caliph during
his address from the pulpit. But this freedom was strangled later on.
They never took themselves as kings but servants of the Muslims.
They served the Muslims like their shepherd and watchmen and
looked after their welfare. But the slightest mistake or doubt about the
speech and action of the caliphs attracted severe criticism from the
public.
The first volume, which is coming to a close, contains an abridged
history of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate. Ten Muslims from among
the Companions had been given glad tidings of Paradise by the
Prophet ~ even during their lifetime. They are known as 'Ashrah
Mubasshirah (the Blessed Ten). Among them are Abu Bakr, Umar,
Uthman, Ali, Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, Talhah, Zubair, Sa'd bin
Waqqas, Abu Ubaidah bin Al-Jarrah and Saeed bin Zaidi$,. All but
the last one have found mention in some chapter of our account. So a
few lines about Saeed bin Zaid ~ seem proper and relevant.

Saeed bin laid ~
He was cousin and brother-in-law of Umar ~ - His pedigree is like
this: Saeed bin Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail bin Abdullah bin Qart bin
Rabah bin Adi. He joined the Prophet ?'i in all the battles except the
battle of Badr. But the Prophet~ gave him a share from the booty of
Badr and counted him among the Companions of Badr. He died in 51
AH, at the age of 72.
Once a woman lodged a complaint against him in regard to a piece of
land. He cursed her with blindness in case she was a liar. She turned
blind and fell into a well and died . Once he heard some unkind words

Second Half of the Rightly-Guided Caliphate

517

against Ali ~ in the Grand Mosque of Kufah and remarked, "Abu
Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, Talhah, Zubair, Abu Ubaidah, Sa'd bin Abu
Waqqas, Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, these nine are among the Blessed
Ten." "Who is the tenth one?" the person inquired. But Saeed~ kept
silent, on repeated insistence, he revealed, "I am the tenth one."
